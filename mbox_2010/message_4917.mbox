Namaste,

Absolutely correct interpretation by Narasimha. This is brilliant=
. The whole 
verse needs to be taken to understand the correct meaning.

> =
IMHO, there is no ambiguity in this half-verse.

urgapaathphalam labhet"


The half-verse should be taken with the previous =
verses to get the actual 
picture. It is like if I say, " On=C2=A0days when=
 I feel=C2=A0tired,=C2=A0I don't go to 
office". If I only take the second =
part of the sentence, it means "I don't go to 
office" and gives an entirel=
y wrong picture. So, the whole needs to be looked at 
to get an actual mean=
ing.

The crux of the matter is simple. Without those 700 verses there is n=
o 
Chandipath. If someone thinks he is doing Chandipath by merely reciting =
Kunjika, 
he is deluding himself. 



* * * *

There is a friend of mine wh=
o is pretty nice sadhaka. For 5 years every day he 
did the Kunjika thrice =
a day without fail.=C2=A0 He knows it by heart. Then from last 
August he s=
tarted doing the actual Chandipath (700 verses) and then Chandi homa. 
He s=
ays the difference in the effects of actual Chandi (700 verses) vs only the=
 
Kunjika is like heaven and hell. He does not do the Kunjika any more.

=C2=A0 
Namaste Utpal,

It=
 is saying that one will get the result of "Durgapath", but is NOT saying 
=
"WITHOUT doing Durgapath". There are a bunch of things one does *along with=
* 
Durgapath, i.e. *in addition to* the actual Durgapath (or Chandipath), w=
ithout 
which one supposedly cannot get the results of Durgapath. This line=
 is saying 
that the results of Durgapath can be obtained by replacing all =
those supplements 
with Kunjika. But it is not saying that the basic Durgap=
ath can also be 
replaced.

It is literally saying "one can get the result =
of Durgapath without doing 
Kavacha, Argala, Keelaka, Rahasya, Sookta, Dhya=
na, Nyasa and Archana and by 
doing just Kunjika stotra instead of them." I=
t is not saying that Durgapath can 
also be skipped. It is only saying that=
 the supplements can be skipped.

Best regards,
Narasimha

<DIV>Namaste,</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Abso=
lutely correct interpretation by Narasimha. This is brilliant. The whole ve=
rse needs to be taken to understand the correct meaning.</DIV>

>> "Kunjika paathmatren Durgapaathphalam labhet"<BR></DIV>
<DIV> </=
DIV>
<DIV>The half-verse should be taken with the previous verses to get th=
e actual picture. It is like if I say, " On days when I feel tire=
d, I don't go to office". If I only take the second part of the senten=
ce, it means "I don't go to office" and gives an entirely wrong picture. So=
, the whole needs to be looked at to get an actual meaning.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbs=
p;</DIV>
<DIV>The crux of the matter is simple. Without those 700 verses th=
ere is no Chandipath. If someone thinks he is doing Chandipath by merely re=
citing Kunjika, he is deluding himself. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV> =
;</DIV>
<DIV>* * * *</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>There is a friend of mine=
 who is pretty nice sadhaka. For 5 years every day he did the Kunjika thric=
e a day without fail.  He knows it by heart. Then from last August he =
started doing the actual Chandipath (700 verses) and then Chandi homa. He s=
ays the difference in the effects of actual Chandi (700 verses) vs only the=
 Kunjika is like heaven and hell. He does not do the Kunjika any more.</DIV=

<P>Namaste Utpal,<BR><BR>It is saying th=
at one will get the result of "Durgapath", but is NOT saying "WITHOUT doing=
 Durgapath". There are a bunch of things one does *along with* Durgapath, i=
.e. *in addition to* the actual Durgapath (or Chandipath), without which on=
e supposedly cannot get the results of Durgapath. This line is saying that =
the results of Durgapath can be obtained by replacing all those supplements=
 with Kunjika. But it is not saying that the basic Durgapath can also be re=
placed.<BR><BR>It is literally saying "one can get the result of Durgapath =
without doing Kavacha, Argala, Keelaka, Rahasya, Sookta, Dhyana, Nyasa and =
Archana and by doing just Kunjika stotra instead of them." It is not saying=
 that Durgapath can also be skipped. It is only saying that the supplements=
 can be skipped.<BR><BR>Best regards,<BR>Narasimha<BR>---------------------=
