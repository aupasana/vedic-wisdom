Namaste,
=C2=A0
While reading a book on the Holy Mother, Ma Sarada, came ac=
ross some nice quotations:
=C2=A0

Ordinary human love results in misery. L=
ove for God brings blessedness.
=C2=A0


As you progress in your spiritual =
practice you will see the same Being in you as in me, and that He is in all=
 men, be they of the lowest castes. Then you will acquire humility.
=C2=A0
=


In course of time one does not feel even the existence of God. After atta=
ining enlightenment one sees that Gods and deities are all maya. Everything=
 comes into existence in time and disappears in time. Gods and such things =
really disappear at the dawn of enlightenment. The aspirant then realizes t=
hat the Mother alone pervades the universe. All then become one.
=C2=A0


W=
here is that competent student who can understand spiritual instruction? Fi=
rst of all one should be fit; otherwise the instructions prove futile.
=C2=
=A0


All great spiritual=C2=A0teachers are one. The same power of God work=
s through them all.
=C2=A0


>From time immemorial so many people have pract=
ised image-worship and thereby got liberation. Who says it=C2=A0is nothing?=

=C2=A0


God is one.s very own. One realizes him in proportion to the inte=
nsity of one's feeling for him.
=C2=A0


What does a man become by realizin=
g God? Does he grow two horns? No, what happens is , he develops discrimina=
tion between the real and the unreal, becomes conscious spiritually, and go=
es beyond life and death. God is realized in spirit. How else can one see G=
od? Has God talked to anyone who is devoid of ecstatic fervour? One sees Go=
d in spiritual vision, talks to him, and establishes relationship with him =
in spirit.
=C2=A0


Through these spiritual disciplines the ties of past ka=
rma are cut asunder. But the realization of God cannot be achieved without =
ecstatic love for him.
=C2=A0


Even the impossible becomes possible throug=
h devotion.
=C2=A0


Neither mantra nor scripture is of any avail; bhakti o=
r devotion alone accomplishes everything.
=C2=A0


Even the wise could hard=
ly realize the natureof Brahman by argument. Is Brahman an object of discus=
sion?
=C2=A0


Give up this dry discussion, this hodgepodge of philosophy. =
Who has been able to know God by reasoning?
=C2=A0


One.s love of God depe=
nds entirely upon one.s inner feeling. Love of God is the essential thing.
=
=C2=A0


Have intense devotion to God. One must work hard. How can one achi=
eve anything without effort? You must devote some time for prayer even in t=
he midst of the busiest hour of the day.
=C2=A0


God cannot be realized wi=
thout love, yes, sincere, absolute=C2=A0love.
=C2=A0


All depends on the g=
race of God. He bestows his grace upon anyone he likes. Grace is the import=
ant thing.
=C2=A0


The human teacher utters the mantra into the ear; but G=
od breathes the spirit into the soul.
=C2=A0


The grace of God is the thin=
g that is needful.One should pray for the grace of God. One must pray sitti=
ng on the bank of the river. One will be taken across in proper time.
=C2=
=A0


Even the water which has got a natural tendency to flow downwards, is=
 drawn up to the sky by the sun.s rays. In the same way, God.s grace lifts =
up the mind which has got a tendency to run after sense objects.
=C2=A0


O=
ne must perform work. It is only through work that the bondage of work will=
 be cut asunder and one will acquire a spirit of non-attachment. One should=
 not be without work even for a moment.
=C2=A0


If you do not pray to God,=
 what is that to him? It is only your misfortune.
=C2=A0


Everything depen=
ds upon one.s mind. Nothing can be achieved without purity of mind.
=C2=A0
=


It is said, .The aspirant might have received the grace of the guru, the =
Lord and his devotees; but he comes to grief without the grace of .one... T=
hat .one. is the mind. The mind of the aspirant must be gracious to him.

In the homam manuals, I have made it a point to insist that people do japam=
 with their favorite mantra at the end of the homam, while sitting still wi=
th closed eyes. The idea is that homam purifies subtle consciousness and *p=
repares* one for reaching god, while it is finally japam that takes one to =
god. After every homam, one's internal purity is at a maximum (a local maxi=
mum, temporally speaking - sorry for the technical jargon) and japam will b=
e more fruitful than at other times.

were doing some other activity, probably your mind will wander even more.

heckler interrupting your speech. Instead of arguing and fighting with the =
heckler, simply take note of him, pause for a second and move on. Instead o=
f panicking or worrying, simply take note of your thoughts, pause for a sec=
ond and move on.
> 
> (2) Mantra means that which protects (tra) the mind (=
mana). Various vasanas (conditioning) are pulling the mind in different dir=
ections to react to various situations in various ways and that activity ti=
res out the mind. You protect it by anchoring it in a mantra and teaching i=
t to overcome the pulls of vasana.
> 
> The proof of whether a mantra or ja=
pam or homam is working for you or not is whether there is a slow internal =
transformation in you or not, whether your internal reaction to various ext=
ernal things is changing for the better or not.

 where a good guru is helpful.

tion is almost ruled out. I suggest doing whatever one does with a sense of=
 surrender and humility. If there is something partly correct that somebody=
 is doing, it will slowly increase with time and Nature will remove imperfe=
ctions with time.
> 
> (4) I can write Obama's name and Gordon's name on sh=
eets of paper next to me and pretend that they came there and sat there. Wi=
ll they really do it? On the other hand, if I am a world leader holding a s=
ummit, probably I can make them actually come and sit there.
> 
> Nyasa mea=
ns placement. When you do nyasa, you place various vibrations (sound patter=
ns) or energies (deities) in various body parts. For most of us with distra=
cted minds, it is merely a formality and means nothing. Only a sadhaka with=

t; <BR>> Nice questions! You can find some answers in the archives. I wi=
ll briefly answer again.<BR>> <BR>> On your first point: Yes, Lord Kr=
ishna did indeed say in the 10th chapter of BhagavadGita: "yaGYaanaam japay=
aGYo.asmi" (of all sacrifices/rituals, I am the japa yajna, i.e. chanting o=
f mantras).<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>>
 <BR>> We can get it in right=
 perspective by noting that the very previous line says "I am Om among all =
mantras".<BR>> <BR>> Yes, Om represents the pure and absolute essence=
 of universe. However, is it possible for everyone to meditate just using "=
Om" and reach god? Probably not. Are Krishna devotees leaving other mantras=
 such as the mahamantra (Hare krishna mantra) and doing japam only with "Om=
", because Krishna said I am "Om" among mantras? Of course, not.<BR>> <B=
R>> Same thing holds to japam vs other sadhanas such as homam.<BR>> <=
BR>> Just as one may need ropes and other gear to climb mount everest, o=
ne may need to employ mantras other than "Om" and practices other than "jap=
am" to overcome one's short-comings and reach the summit of the absolute, r=
epresented by Om (and all other things mentioned by Krishna).<BR>> <BR>&=
gt; * * *<BR>> <BR>> When you do an external sacrifical ritual such a=
s homam, your body is engaging in
 actions. So your mind has to be attached=
 to the body and use it in a particular way. Can one reach samadhi while do=
ing homam? Unlikely. One is more likely to reach samadhi when one stops the=
 external actions. Mind may be withdrawn completely from the body and absor=
b fully in the mantra at some stage then.<BR>> <BR>> From the point o=
f view, japam (sitting still and meditating on a mantra) is the ultimate sa=
dhana.<BR>> <BR>> However, not everyone can reach god like that. Ther=
e are so many vasanas (conditioning) in the mind that needs to be purged/pu=
rified slowly. Until that is done, japam may not help one reach god. Until =
then, taking the help of an external pure object (such as fire) that has a =
purifying effect on one's subtle consciousness can be helpful. It *prepares=
* one for good japam.<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> A lot of prie=
sts do homam and then leave the fire and go away. In the homam manuals, I h=
ave made it a point to
 insist that people do japam with their favorite man=
tra at the end of the homam, while sitting still with closed eyes. The idea=
 is that homam purifies subtle consciousness and *prepares* one for reachin=
g god, while it is finally japam that takes one to god. After every homam, =
one's internal purity is at a maximum (a local maximum, temporally speaking=
 - sorry for the technical jargon) and japam will be more fruitful than at =
other times.<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> Now onto other questio=
ns:<BR>> <BR>> (1) It is unfruitful in the sense that it does not tak=
e you closer to god. It is fruitful in the sense that it stops you from goi=
ng much further away from god. After all, if you weren't engaged in that ja=
pam and you were doing some other activity, probably your mind will wander =
even more.<BR>> <BR>> I suggest looking at disturbing thoughts in the=
 middle of a japam as a heckler interrupting your speech. Instead of arguin=
g and fighting
 with the heckler, simply take note of him, pause for a seco=
nd and move on. Instead of panicking or worrying, simply take note of your =
thoughts, pause for a second and move on.<BR>> <BR>> (2) Mantra means=
 that which protects (tra) the mind (mana). Various vasanas (conditioning) =
are pulling the mind in different directions to react to various situations=
 in various ways and that activity tires out the mind. You protect it by an=
choring it in a mantra and teaching it to overcome the pulls of vasana.<BR>=
> <BR>> The proof of whether a mantra or japam or homam is working fo=
r you or not is whether there is a slow internal transformation in you or n=
ot, whether your internal reaction to various external things is changing f=
or the better or not.<BR>> <BR>> (3) Difficult. This is where a good =
guru is helpful.<BR>> <BR>> Actually, in this age, technical perfecti=
on is almost ruled out. I suggest doing whatever one does with a sense of s=
urrender
 and humility. If there is something partly correct that somebody =
is doing, it will slowly increase with time and Nature will remove imperfec=
tions with time.<BR>> <BR>> (4) I can write Obama's name and Gordon's=
 name on sheets of paper next to me and pretend that they came there and sa=
t there. Will they really do it? On the other hand, if I am a world leader =
holding a summit, probably I can make them actually come and sit there.<BR>=
> <BR>> Nyasa means placement. When you do nyasa, you place various v=
ibrations (sound patterns) or energies (deities) in various body parts. For=
 most of us with distracted minds, it is merely a formality and means nothi=
ng. Only a sadhaka with a pure, pointed and focused mind can actually place=
 various vibrations and energies in various body parts.<BR>> <BR>> I =
always suggest to people to do nyasa as taught by elders (so that the knowl=
edge lives and is passed on), but not worry too much about it.<BR>>
 <BR=
>> As I said, we are in the midst of deepening Kali and the level of sad=
hakas is not as high as in the old days. Technical perfection will become r=
arer and rarer. It is better to focus on surrender and humility.<BR>> <B=
