Namaskarams to Narasimhaji, Rajarshi , Hari and every one else,
Thanks for =
the encouraging words from each one of you. The points that you have all me=
ntioned regarding continuing on the path without getting distracted is a va=
lid one.Definitely I have not even a miniscule portion of the minutest know=
ledge of the supreme to talk about my experiences. My account was strictly =
a excited narration of what I felt during the homam just like a child who h=
as learnt how to talk a few words for the first time becomes excited and re=
peats the same thing over and over but then he=C2=A0 realises that there ar=
e more words to learn and continues on the path.

This group and the discus=
sions among the team members have definitely guided me towards the right sp=
iritual road. Thanks again to everyone contributing directly or indirectly =
towards this group.
May the mother bless and show all of=C2=A0 us the way.
=

Regards,
Girish Sundaram

 Experience

=C2=A0 
Namaste Girish,

I am glad you started Chandi homam. K=
eep doing it as regularly as you can. It can only purify your consciousness=
 further and further as you do it more and more.

As far as "experiences" a=
re concerned, different people will have different experiences. Some people=
 with more intuitive and imaginative minds may have visions. Some people wi=
th more logical and rational minds may experience a clarity of mind. But, o=
verall, anyone doing homam on a regular basis will start to love fire, iden=
tify with fire, experience some kind of calmness, bliss and vitality when w=
ith fire. The specific experiences and visions are not worth bothering much=
 about.

One person driving a hillside road may see beautiful scenery on th=
e way. He may be charmed by it, keep watching, get stuck there and not reac=
h the top of the hill. Another person driving the road on the other side of=
 the hill may not see any scenery, but keep driving and reach the top of th=
e hill and enjoy a perfect view of everything from there.

Similarly, someo=
ne having visions and experiences may become either egoistic or attached an=
d get stuck. Someone having no experiences whatsoever may keep doing sadhan=
a and oneday become self-realized.

Like a mother serves each child what is=
 good for him/her, Devi can give experiences to some people in order to rei=
nforce their faith. But pay little attention to such experiences and keep d=
oing sadhana. THAT is the key.

Hari's words are wise. It is a good idea to=
 keep one's experiences to oneself. Of course, as Ramakrishna Paramahamsa s=
aid on another occasion, one having climbed a wall and seen a beautiful hea=
venly place on the other hand, may want to come back and tell others about =
it. If everyone who climbs the wall jumps on the other side and settles dow=
n there, how will other people know about it? So some people need to do tha=
t job (of coming back into the village and telling people). But realize tha=
t one who does that job stands the chance of getting stuck and never going =
back there. Secondly, one should consider talking about one's experiences t=
o others only after making some progress. Third, one should ensure that non=
e of one's experiences cause pride in some way or the other.

Best regards,=

Narasimha
