Respected Sir,

Thanks a lot.

I want to include Narayana Kavacham in my ro=
utine schedule. I will be able to read it once a day. I understand it is no=
t enough to get desirable results but I hope it will still be better than d=
oing nothing. 

Sir, I am not perfect in intonation and also I do not fully=
 understands the meaning yet. I tried to absorb the meaning verse by verse =
today and tried to improve my intonation but I think it will take some time=
 before I reach a considerable level.

Sir, till then should I read only tr=
anslation or should I read sanskrit verses? I will be thankful if you can s=
pare a few minutes in explaining if there is any special instruction or any=
 important thing which I should take care of. 

Kind Regards
Atul

But Till then can I do the Krishna Homam in night? As written in your book =
"Vedic Wisdom" Maha Ganpati Homam can be done at night. So should I switch =
