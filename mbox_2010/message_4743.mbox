 "The Real Self is the Infinite I-I, i.e.,
"I" is perfection. It is eternal=
. It has
no origin and no end. The other I is
born and also dies. It is imp=
ermanent.
See to whom are the changing thoughts.
They will be found to aris=
e after the "I"
thought. Hold the "I" thought. They
subside. Trace back the=
 source of the
"I" thought.
The Self alone will remain."

[from] Talks with=
 Ramana Maharshi
-recorded, Oct 21, 1936-

People often ask how the mind is=
 controlled.
I say to them, 'Show me the mind and then
you will know what t=
o do.' The fact is that
the mind is only a bundle of thoughts. How can
you =
extinguish it by the thought of doing so
or by a desire? Your thoughts and =
desires are
part and parcel of the mind. The mind is simply
fattened by new=
 thoughts rising up. Therefore
it is foolish to attempt to kill the mind by=

means of the mind. The only way of doing it is
to find its source and hold=
 on to it. The mind
will then fade away of its own accord.

- Sri Ramana Ma=
harshi

"Knowledge implies ignorance of what lies beyond
what is known. Kno=
wledge is ever limited."

"You do not know what you were before birth,
yet =
you want to know what you will be after
death. Do you know what you are now=
?"

"Birth and rebirth are mentioned only to make
you investigate the quest=
ion and find out that
there are neither births nor rebirths. They relate
to=
 the body and not to the Self. Know the Self
and do not be perturbed by dou=
bts."

[from] Talks with Ramana Maharshi

-recorded, Nov 10, 1936-

"The 'H=
eart' is not physical. Meditation should not
be on the right or the left. M=
editation should be
on the Self. Everyone knows, 'I am.'
Who is the 'I?'
It=
 will be neither within nor without, neither on
the right or the left.
'I a=
m' -- that is all.
The Heart is the center from which everything
springs. B=
ecause you see the world, the body
and so on, it is said there is a center =
for these,
which is called the Heart.
When you are in the Heart, the Heart =
is known
to be neither the center nor the circumference.
There is nothing e=
lse.
Whose center could it be?"

[from] Talks with Ramana Maharshi

-record=
ed, Oct 23rd, 1936-

The calm and clear awareness where
There is no movemen=
t of the mind
Is firm samadhi, moksha-like.
Try earnestly to free the mind
=
>From traitor thoughts and so experience
Calm and clear awareness, purity of=
 heart.

Verse 919 - Guruvachaka Kovai

"Death is only a thought and nothin=
g more.
He who thinks raises troubles. Let the thinker
tell us what happens=
 to him in death.
The Real "I" is silent.
One should not think "I am this--=
I am not that."
To say "this" or "that" is wrong. They are also
limitations=
.
Only "I Am" is the truth.
Silence is "I."
If one thinks "I am this" anoth=
er thinks "I am this"
and so on.
There is a clash of thoughts and so many
r=
eligions are the result.
The truth remains as it is, not affected by
any st=
atements, conflicting or otherwise."
