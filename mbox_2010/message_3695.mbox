Namaste,

You should NOT Say 'Swaahaa' or offer Aaahuti after 'Dhyaanam'.

=
CP book published by 'Gita Press' is a good one so try to get that or verif=
y the book you are having. However, you need not postpone your Homam till y=
ou get the accurate book. Offer Aahuti while saying Swaahaa after every Uva=
ach, Uchuh and each verse of 13 chapters. so at the end you will end up off=
ering 700 Aahutis (Saptashati means 700).

Practice and vigilance will even=
tually make you perfect and solve the issue of loss of fire, deepam etc...i=
 faced problems of such nature during few initial homas. If deepam goes off=
, lit it again and same with fire. Do not worry as Nothing is inauspicious =
during homam. Inauspiciousness, if any, will be burnt to death by the fire =
of Jatavedas.  

Best of luck

Utpal

Also dhyanam is followed soon after nyasa. When you say read the nyasa shou=
