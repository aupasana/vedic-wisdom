Namaste, everybody.

I've mostly been lurking for the past few mo=
nths. Back in February 2009, I
was hospitalized for colon cancer surgery; t=
hey removed much of my
transverse colon. I've spent the time since then at =
a nursing home. I'm also
getting kidney dialysis three times a week, since =
my kidneys are
increasingly dysfunctional.

About a month ago, my blood tes=
ts showeed a marker of cancer activity again.
Tests indicate that the disea=
se has returned to my colon,, and spread a bit
to nearby lymph nodes. My on=
cologist decided to put me on a regimen of
chemotherapy. I go for my first =
"infusion" Monday (tomorrow). The list of
side effects are almost as terrif=
ying as the disease.

I'm chanting the Mahamritunjaya mantra most mornings.=
 Also visualizing Ma
Varahi battling the cancer asura; I chose Varahi becau=
se in her role as a
Matrika (Divine Mother) she rules over the abdomen/ man=
ipura chakra. I know
several of the long-term members of Shakti Sadhana gro=
up have practices
devoted to Ma Varahi, and advice or suggestions about her=
 worship is
sincerely requested.

I'll probably be inaccessible for Monday =
and Tuesday, but members who'd like
to write to me can do so at...
