Namaste,

No, the ID you mention is not the same, but it is not good to ide=
ntify and 
embarass someone. This person belongs to a completely different =
group, not to 
this one and I have no idea if he is a Sri Vidya upasaka but=
 he apparently knows 
a lot based on what he claims.

My point was to basic=
ally bring my point to this discussion of purity and ego to 
success in sad=
hana. Ravana might have been a cruel person to others, but he knew 
he woul=
d always bow his head down in front of his Lord Siva. And the example of 
I=
 guy of this person is just one instance of an example, I go to temple ever=
y 
week, and every time, I see atleast some people who offer abhisek to Siv=
a Linga 
as if they are doing the Lord some favour by offering water....the=
y would pour 
the water with one hand, and sometimes in a manner that the w=
ater/milk mixture 
would spalsh everywhere making the whole place wet and g=
radually stinky. You 
have got to look at some of these people.....I mean i=
f offering abhisek is so 
much of an effort for some of these people, why d=
o they even bother, and would I 
be surprised if they find their effort is =
not paying them any wanted results?

Regards,
Bhupendra

<DIV>Namaste,</DIV>
<DIV>&n=
bsp;</DIV>
<DIV>My emails are usually ignored as pointless blabber but if I=
 could add some words here. Cessation of Ahamkara and purity seems to be on=
ly required in the initial stages when you are still struggling to acquire =
a steady mind needed for mantra sadhana success. Once you have achieved som=
e level of success, discipline that may have been required in the initial s=
tages is no longer necessary.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>I have read a fe=
w of Sivanandas books....most of them are available on their website for fr=
ee downloads as pdf. And what he has stated is that to develop a steady min=
d, strict discipline is necessary on food and detachment from sexual activi=
ty as would be in celibacy. Once you have been able to steady you mind=
, you may give up this discipline. If you look at the case of Ravana, he di=
d a lot of penance while he was young. The arrogant and cruel Ravana that p=
eople thing of him today is essentially part of his adult life.....once he =
had already perfected his ability to concentrate. But why look at Ravana al=
one. You read any mythology, purana or granth and you will come across Rish=
i's who are supposed to be pious and humble, but they seem to be ever =
ready to curse anybody even with a slightest disappointment, most of them s=
eemed to have big egos.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>I do not know if you h=
ave read the Aghora books on Vimalananda,  but if you read that, even =
when Vimalananda talks of giving up ego, he or his gurus did not like being=
 challenged on any matter and this is time and again seen in his books=
.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Ofcourse above all, you need to keep your eg=
o in control before the Lord even though you may be reckless to other human=
s. There is someone I know....I do not know him personally but only through=
 message exchanges over groups like this. He seems to have knowledge of a l=
ot of sadhana's and has practiced quite a lot of them. Success seems to ill=
ude him though. According to him, when he does sadhana for others, it succe=
eds immediately but not when he does this for himself. And he was once =
;asking everybody and anybody to help him out with the situation. I really =
do not know much about the various sadhanas for achieving specific needs. S=
o I suggested that instead of of asking for suggestions of different sadhan=
a from everybody, why does he not just tell the lord in his prayer one day =
that the effects of his bad karmas are getting too much to bear and if the =
Lord could provide him the success he is looking for in his life. He retort=
ed and shot back at
 me that he did not spend time and energy in learning t=
hese various tantric sadhanas just to beg before god, he only knows how to =
demand from god.! I reminded him that all this while, he was not having any=
 problems begging for help and suggestion from other group members and yet,=
 he is not willing to beg from god when really god is the one and only who =
can really do anything the problems he is facing. I do not think even Ravan=
a had that attitude that this person did, when he would sit down for h=
is sadhana.</DIV>
