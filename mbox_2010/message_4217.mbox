Dear Narasimhagaru, 
=C2=A0
I apologise for taking freedom in repeating my =
prior questions that I posted a couple of times on the forum before. But si=
nce you are responding again, I am hoping that you would catch them now. 
=
=C2=A0
1. Is there a specific Homam prescribed for Gayatri Mata or can we j=
ust use avahana mantra 'OmityEkAkshara Brahma' of Sandhyavandanam and proce=
ed? 
=C2=A0
2. Is there one for Lord Karthikeya?

Namaste Veneet ji,

Nice questio=
ns! You can find some answers in the archives. I will briefly answer again.=


On your first point: Yes, Lord Krishna did indeed say in the 10th chapter=
 of BhagavadGita: "yaGYaanaam japayaGYo.asmi" (of all sacrifices/rituals, I=
 am the japa yajna, i.e. chanting of mantras).

* * *

We can get it in rig=
ht perspective by noting that the very previous line says "I am Om among al=
l mantras".

Yes, Om represents the pure and absolute essence of universe. =
However, is it possible for everyone to meditate just using "Om" and reach =
god? Probably not. Are Krishna devotees leaving other mantras such as the m=
ahamantra (Hare krishna mantra) and doing japam only with "Om", because Kri=
shna said I am "Om" among mantras? Of course, not.

Same thing holds to jap=
am vs other sadhanas such as homam.

Just as one may need ropes and other g=
ear to climb mount everest, one may need to employ mantras other than "Om" =
and practices other than "japam" to overcome one's short-comings and reach =
the summit of the absolute, represented by Om (and all other things mention=
ed by Krishna).

* * *

When you do an external sacrifical ritual such as h=
omam, your body is engaging in actions. So your mind has to be attached to =
the body and use it in a particular way. Can one reach samadhi while doing =
homam? Unlikely. One is more likely to reach samadhi when one stops the ext=
ernal actions. Mind may be withdrawn completely from the body and absorb fu=
lly in the mantra at some stage then.

>From the point of view, japam (sitti=
ng still and meditating on a mantra) is the ultimate sadhana.

However, not=
 everyone can reach god like that. There are so many vasanas (conditioning)=
 in the mind that needs to be purged/purified slowly. Until that is done, j=
apam may not help one reach god. Until then, taking the help of an external=
 pure object (such as fire) that has a purifying effect on one's subtle con=
sciousness can be helpful. It *prepares* one for good japam.

* * *

A lot =
of priests do homam and then leave the fire and go away. In the homam manua=
ls, I have made it a point to insist that people do japam with their favori=
te mantra at the end of the homam, while sitting still with closed eyes. Th=
e idea is that homam purifies subtle consciousness and *prepares* one for r=
eaching god, while it is finally japam that takes one to god. After every h=
omam, one's internal purity is at a maximum (a local maximum, temporally sp=
eaking - sorry for the technical jargon) and japam will be more fruitful th=
an at other times.

* * *

Now onto other questions:

(1) It is unfruitful =
in the sense that it does not take you closer to god. It is fruitful in the=
 sense that it stops you from going much further away from god. After all, =
if you weren't engaged in that japam and you were doing some other activity=
, probably your mind will wander even more.

I suggest looking at disturbin=
g thoughts in the middle of a japam as a heckler interrupting your speech. =
Instead of arguing and fighting with the heckler, simply take note of him, =
pause for a second and move on. Instead of panicking or worrying, simply ta=
ke note of your thoughts, pause for a second and move on.

(2) Mantra means=
 that which protects (tra) the mind (mana). Various vasanas (conditioning) =
are pulling the mind in different directions to react to various situations=
 in various ways and that activity tires out the mind. You protect it by an=
choring it in a mantra and teaching it to overcome the pulls of vasana.

Th=
e proof of whether a mantra or japam or homam is working for you or not is =
whether there is a slow internal transformation in you or not, whether your=
 internal reaction to various external things is changing for the better or=
 not.

(3) Difficult. This is where a good guru is helpful.

Actually, in t=
his age, technical perfection is almost ruled out. I suggest doing whatever=
 one does with a sense of surrender and humility. If there is something par=
tly correct that somebody is doing, it will slowly increase with time and N=
ature will remove imperfections with time.

(4) I can write Obama's name an=
d Gordon's name on sheets of paper next to me and pretend that they came th=
ere and sat there. Will they really do it? On the other hand, if I am a wor=
ld leader holding a summit, probably I can make them actually come and sit =
there.

Nyasa means placement. When you do nyasa, you place various vibrati=
ons (sound patterns) or energies (deities) in various body parts. For most =
of us with distracted minds, it is merely a formality and means nothing. On=
ly a sadhaka with a pure, pointed and focused mind can actually place vario=
us vibrations and energies in various body parts.

I always suggest to peop=
le to do nyasa as taught by elders (so that the knowledge lives and is pass=
ed on), but not worry too much about it.

As I said, we are in the midst of=
 deepening Kali and the level of sadhakas is not as high as in the old days=
. Technical perfection will become rarer and rarer. It is better to focus o=
n surrender and humility.

Best regards,
Narasimha
