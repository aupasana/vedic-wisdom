Namaskaram Narasimha garu,  Can the homam performed during upanayanam be do=
ne using only coconuts and nuts?  Do the samidhalu that priests use serve a=
ny specific purpose of the ritual?  What part(s) of Upanayanam ritual (or t=
here after) should one not miss or be aware of?  I want my son and us to be=
 aware of the process rather than blindly doing what is asked of us.  

You=
r response in the subject is much much appreciated. 

Thanks in advance,
-S=
unitha
