Dear friends,

Namaste!

Astrologers =
routinely recommend remedial measures involving mantras and poojas and peop=
le spend a lot of money on them. Do they work? I will give my 2 cents of vi=
ews based on my experience and insights. I will be honest, straight-forward=
 and blunt.

* * *

Though believers call priests and get poojas done, in t=
he hope that their problems will be solved, many priests today are incapabl=
e of producing any results. As a result, some believers got accustomed to a=
ccepting that a pudding exists even without eating it and remain hungry thr=
oughout life. And some intelligent people stopped believing in god and in r=
emedies. Let me first address why this has come to be and then talk about w=
hat we should do.

In ancient times, caste system was not as rigid as it is=
 today. One's varna was decided based on one's aptitude. One primarily inte=
rested in knowledge and spiritual progress would be a Brahmana. One primari=
ly interested in power, authority and control over others would be a Kshatr=
iya. One primarily interested in money would be a Vaisya. One primarily int=
erested in physical pleasures would be a Shudra. One would start off with t=
he varna of one's father, as that is what one is exposed to in childhood. H=
owever, as one's vasana (mental conditioning) blooms, one would get one's o=
wn varna. One born a Shudra like Valmiki, for example, can later turn into =
a Braahmana and become a Maharshi. One born a Kshatriya like Viswamitra, fo=
r example, can later turn into a Brahmana and become a Maharshi.

In the ol=
d days, there were true Brahmanas, who would only be interested in knowledg=
e and spiritual progress and not caring about power, influence, money, plea=
sures etc. Such Brahmanas became quite pure and accumulated enough spiritua=
l energy through continuous sadhana over years and were capable of performi=
ng very effective poojas for people.

Today, people who have spiritual pote=
ntial may be born in non-Brahmana families and not allowed to develop fully=
 due to the rigid caste structures. Some people born in Brahmana families m=
ay also end up getting into modern careers and not developing fully as Brah=
manas. Some people may be born in Brahmana families with Kshatriya/Vaisya/S=
hudra tendencies and may end up becoming priests who are interested in powe=
r, authority and control over others, money and physical pleasures. Those p=
riests who only care about knowledge and spiritual progress (i.e. true Brah=
manas) are very rare. As a result, Brahmanas who have done genuine sadhana =
and accumulated a good amount of spiritual energy are so few.

* * *

If on=
e has one million dollars in one's bank account, a check given by one for t=
housand dollars is meaningful. If one's bank account is empty, what good is=
 a thousand dollar check given by one? It will bounce. Similarly, poojas do=
ne and blessings given by a priest without enough spiritual energy cannot b=
ring one any benefits.

One important note: The power is not in a combinati=
on of syllables (mantra) or a sequence of physical actions (ritual). The po=
wer is in the MIND that FOCUSES on a combination of syllables (mantra) or a=
 sequence of physical actions (ritual). Energy is generated when mind overc=
omes its tendency to wander and instead focuses on one thing. Different man=
tras and rituals as the focus points may generate different kinds of energy=
, but the key is focus. Without it, no mantra or ritual produces anything. =
Focus comes with a lot of practice. Most priests are just engaging in casua=
l practice when they go and do poojas. In the old days, priests did intense=
 sadhana and brought that energy to the table when they did rituals at the =
houses of people or in temples.

I did see priests who have done good sadha=
na, purified themselves and carry some spiritual energy. But those are gett=
ing rarer and rarer now-a-days. One can most certainly not bank on finding =
such a priest.

* * *

Given this, one is better off not depending on the p=
riest/Brahmana class for remedies. BTW, I have nothing against the "Brahman=
a by birth" class, having been born in an orthodox Brahmana family myself. =
I have neither love nor hatred for the "Brahmana by birth" class. My only w=
ish is that more people - from any birth caste - develop into true Brahmana=
s.

Instead of a Brahmana-by-birth who is possibly proud of his skills and =
thinking about money and possibly not identifying with your trouble, you ca=
n do the mantra/ritual yourself. Atleast your identification with the troub=
le and your desire to solve the problem will be better than the priest. If =
you manage to generate enough focus after practice, the mantra/ritual may a=
ctually produce some result. There is no harm in trying.

* * *

Many peopl=
e think that poojas to gods are a serious matter and only a trained priest =
should do them. The procedures have evolved to become quite complicated ove=
r the time too!

However, complexity of rituals should never be a deterrent=
. Suppose rules dictate that you MUST eat 2000 calories everyday, 40 grams =
of protein, so many grams of vitamin A etc. Suppose you have no access to s=
uch balanced food. Will you starve yourself until you find a balanced meal =
or will you manage with whatever you have? If you just have a bowl of dal (=
lentil soup) and rice, you will simply eat it. You atleast get some energy.=


Similarly, if you do not know the "perfect way" to do a mantra/ritual, yo=
u need not wait till you know the perfect way. You can start with what you =
know. It will only give you energy.

* * *

The fear to do rituals without =
"perfect knowledge" stems from the notion that some mantras/rituals can be =
dangerous. That notion is not totally baseless, but it is irrelevant today.=


It is possible to focus the mind on some mantras and rituals and get spec=
ific results. When used by someone with a high level of spiritual energy, s=
ome mantras and rituals may work very fast and give specific powerful resul=
ts. However, Nature has purposely hidden (almost) such things in this age.
=

I will give an analogy. A machine gun and a stick can be used to attack en=
emies. Stick is safe to use, but, one using a machine gun needs to be very =
careful. One needs to learn well, practice well and then use it, lest one s=
hould hurt oneself by accident.

However, suppose the house lord purposely =
removed ammunition from the machine gun. Then it is used just like a stick =
and not risky. Instead of waiting for perfect instructions on how to use th=
e machine gun, just take it and start beating your enemies with it.

"Ammun=
ition" has purposely been removed from most targeted mantras and rituals (m=
achine guns) in this age. Instead of waiting for perfect knowledge, one can=
 start using them right away.

A lot of technicalities related to mantras a=
nd rituals are irrelevant today. Mantras and rituals are to be taken up wit=
h faith, devotion and surrender to god. Whatever technicalities one can rea=
listically follow should be followed and emphasis should be placed on devot=
ion and surrender. If one keeps doing sadhana, eventually one's devotion an=
d focus will improve and, for all you know, a result may come.

Given that =
we do not have perfect focus and surrender, we cannot expect specific resul=
ts to come in specific counts of recitation. So we should just do the best =
job we can and leave the result to god, who decides when and what result sh=
ould be given.

Bottomline is that no effort is wasted in the end. Every si=
ncere effort generates some fruit or the other, sometime or the other!!!

*=
 * *

Different mantras and rituals are like begging bowls of different sha=
pes. They matter only so much. Depending on what kind of a begging bowl you=
 use, you may be given different kind of alms. But it is important to start=
 begging with some begging bowl or the other, instead of spending years loo=
king for the perfect begging bowl.

Instead of waiting for astrologers with=
 half-baked or ill-conceived knowledge to tell you the perfect mantra or ri=
tual, do what your heart tells you or what your guru (or an elder you respe=
ct) tells you. Mantras like Gayatri mantra, Shiva panchakshari mantra, Vish=
nu sahasranaama stotra, Ganapathi atharva seersha, Hanuman chalisa, Bheemar=
upi Hanuman stotra, Vishnu's shadakshari/ashtakshari/dwadasakshari mantra, =
Venkateswara's ashtakshari/dwadasakshari mantra, hare krishna mantra, Chand=
ipath (Durga saptashati), Durga saptashloki, Lalita sahasranaama stotra, Vy=
asa's navagraha stotra, Aditya Hridayam, Lakshmi ashtottarashatanaama stotr=
a etc are *generic* and can work for anyone for any purpose.

Do not waste =
time looking for a perfect recommendation, perfect procedure, perfect muhur=
ta etc and just do some sadhana or the other with a sincere heart.

Your ef=
fort will not go waste. Your problem may be solved or you may overcome your=
 situation and stop worrying, or atleast your focus will improve.

* * *

I=
n this context, I want to say a few words about homam, the sadhana of rishi=
s.

Fire ritual is found in many ancient religions. Unlike the elements of =
earth, water and air, fire is ever pure and it purifies whatever it comes i=
n contact with. The Sanskrit name for fire is paavaka, i.e. purifier. Fire =
is a living god that everyone has access to. Spending time worshipping god =
through fire purifies one's subtle consciousness. Homam is far more effecti=
ve than most other sadhanas in improving one's focus, changing one's inner =
personality and removing material and spiritual obstacles. One need not tak=
e my words for granted. One can try for oneself for a few months. The proof=
 of the pudding is in eating it.

Vedic seers (rishis) performed homam regu=
larly, for the benefit of the world. When composing the Jyotish masterpiece=
 "Brihat Paaraasara Horaa Saastram" just before the advent of Kali yuga, fo=
r guidance to the people of Kali yuga, Maharshi Parasara recommended variou=
s types of homam as remedial measures for various problems in the horoscope=
. In fact, most remedies he recommended involve homam. Parasara asked to fo=
llow whatever procedures one was taught for starting fire and did not focus=
 on the nitty gritty of homam. He only gave the main mantra to beused in ho=
mam. Parasara's clear teachings set to rest the notion that some people hav=
e, that homam is not for Kali yuga.

* * *

In Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna s=
aid, "yaGYaanaaM japayaGYo.asmi", i.e. I am japa among all sacrifices. Some=
 people use this line to suggest that japam (meditation) is superior to hom=
a/yajna. Let me put that in perspective.

In the line just above that line,=
 Sri Krishna also said, "I am Om among all mantras". However, do we only me=
ditate with the supreme mantra "Om" and leave all other mantras?

If one sa=
ys that sitting on the pinnacle is the best part of climbing a mountain, it=
 does not mean that the process of climbing it using various kinds of gear =
is useless. In fact, one needs that process to reach the pinnacle. Most can=
not reach the pinnacle directly.

Similarly, Om is the supreme of all mantr=
as being the source of all, but reaching the source may require using sever=
al mantras first to purify oneself. Meditating and absorbing consciousness =
in the Supreme (japa) may be the supreme sacrifice, but it may require puri=
fication and preparation by engaging in other kinds of sacrifices (hama/yaj=
na).

When one does homam or yajna, one is engaging in external actions and=
 one is unlikely to reach samadhi (absorbption in the Supreme). When a perf=
ectly purified person does japam (i.e. sits still and contemplates), one ma=
y reach samadhi. However, to purify oneself, homam is far more effective.

=
* * *

Detailed manuals giving short procedures for doing various types of =
homam by oneself are available on the website given below. You can use the =
resources on that website to perform several kinds of short homam by yourse=
lf.

Now *hundreds* of people are performing homam by themselves either dai=
ly or weekly. Some people are also doing monthly.

When Manish (my spiritua=
l guru - a small write-up on him can be read in message 3481 of vedic-wisdo=
m yahoogroup, i.e. http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3481)=
 told me that the Divine Mother appeared before him during Shata Chandi hom=
am at a temple in Chennai in March 2006, directed him to spread a simplifie=
d homam ritual around the world, and showed him that hundreds of thousands =
of people would be performing regular homam in a few years, thus helping re=
verse the decay of Dharma and Truth on earth, it seemed quite far-fetched t=
o my rational mind.

However, just 4 years after the Mother's command, hund=
reds of people are already performing regular homam. Though these are just =
the early days, the developments are amazing. Some of them are laymen who n=
ever even lit a lamp and did not know how to do ANY pooja or ritual. It is =
a miracle that such people are doing a homam everyday, like the rishis and =
Brahmanas of yore. I also know personally that some people doing homam for =
a couple of years are actually starting to experience things within and out=
side and, more importantly, going through rapid internal transformation.

*=
 * *

I am neither a missionary nor a mercenary. I do not sell anything to =
anyone, nor do I force anything on anyone. I just freely share what I know,=
 what I saw and what I am inspired to share. The rest is not in my hands.

=
I want to respectfully, humbly and lovingly invite those who have even an i=
ota of interest to check out the homam website! If one gets into the habit =
of performing homam regularly, it has the great potential to transform one'=
s life, materially and spiritually..

uru (or an elder you respect) tells you. Mantras like Gayatri mantra, Shiva=
 panchakshari mantra, Vishnu sahasranaama stotra, Ganapathi atharva seersha=
, Hanuman chalisa, Bheemarupi Hanuman stotra, Vishnu's shadakshari/ashtaksh=
ari/dwadasakshari mantra, Venkateswara's ashtakshari/dwadasakshari mantra, =
hare krishna mantra, Chandipath (Durga saptashati), Durga saptashloki, Lali=
ta sahasranaama stotra, Vyasa's navagraha stotra, Aditya Hridayam, Lakshmi =
ashtottarashatanaama stotra etc are *generic* and can work for anyone for a=
ny purpose.<BR><BR>Do
 not waste time looking for a perfect recommendation,=
 perfect procedure, perfect muhurta etc and just do some sadhana or the oth=
er with a sincere heart.<BR><BR>Your effort will not go waste. Your problem=
 may be solved or you may overcome your situation and stop worrying, or atl=
east your focus will improve.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>In this context, I want t=
o say a few words about homam, the sadhana of rishis.<BR><BR>Fire ritual is=
 found in many ancient religions. Unlike the elements of earth, water and a=
ir, fire is ever pure and it purifies whatever it comes in contact with. Th=
e Sanskrit name for fire is paavaka, i.e. purifier. Fire is a living god th=
at everyone has access to. Spending time worshipping god through fire purif=
ies one's subtle consciousness. Homam is far more effective than most other=
 sadhanas in improving one's focus, changing one's inner personality and re=
moving material and spiritual obstacles. One need not take my words for gra=
nted. One can
 try for oneself for a few months. The proof of the pudding i=
s in eating it.<BR><BR>Vedic seers (rishis) performed homam regularly, for =
the benefit of the world. When composing the Jyotish masterpiece "Brihat Pa=
araasara Horaa Saastram" just before the advent of Kali yuga, for guidance =
to the people of Kali yuga, Maharshi Parasara recommended various types of =
homam as remedial measures for various problems in the horoscope. In fact, =
most remedies he recommended involve homam. Parasara asked to follow whatev=
er procedures one was taught for starting fire and did not focus on the nit=
ty gritty of homam. He only gave the main mantra to beused in homam. Parasa=
ra's clear teachings set to rest the notion that some people have, that hom=
am is not for Kali yuga.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>In Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna =
said, "yaGYaanaaM japayaGYo.asmi", i.e. I am japa among all sacrifices. Som=
e people use this line to suggest that japam (meditation) is superior to
 h=
oma/yajna. Let me put that in perspective.<BR><BR>In the line just above th=
at line, Sri Krishna also said, "I am Om among all mantras". However, do we=
 only meditate with the supreme mantra "Om" and leave all other mantras?<BR=
><BR>If one says that sitting on the pinnacle is the best part of climbing =
a mountain, it does not mean that the process of climbing it using various =
kinds of gear is useless. In fact, one needs that process to reach the pinn=
acle. Most cannot reach the pinnacle directly.<BR><BR>Similarly, Om is the =
supreme of all mantras being the source of all, but reaching the source may=
 require using several mantras first to purify oneself. Meditating and abso=
rbing consciousness in the Supreme (japa) may be the supreme sacrifice, but=
 it may require purification and preparation by engaging in other kinds of =
sacrifices (hama/yajna).<BR><BR>When one does homam or yajna, one is engagi=
ng in external actions and one is unlikely to reach samadhi
 (absorbption i=
n the Supreme). When a perfectly purified person does japam (i.e. sits stil=
l and contemplates), one may reach samadhi. However, to purify oneself, hom=
am is far more effective.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Detailed manuals giving short=
 procedures for doing various types of homam by oneself are available on th=
e website given below. You can use the resources on that website to perform=
 several kinds of short homam by yourself.<BR><BR>Now *hundreds* of people =
are performing homam by themselves either daily or weekly. Some people are =
also doing monthly.<BR><BR>When Manish (my spiritual guru - a small write-u=
p on him can be read in message 3481 of vedic-wisdom yahoogroup, i.e. <A hr=

/A>) told me that the Divine Mother appeared before him during Shata Chandi=
 homam at a temple in Chennai in March 2006, directed him
 to spread a simp=
lified homam ritual around the world, and showed him that hundreds of thous=
ands of people would be performing regular homam in a few years, thus helpi=
ng reverse the decay of Dharma and Truth on earth, it seemed quite far-fetc=
hed to my rational mind.<BR><BR>However, just 4 years after the Mother's co=
mmand, hundreds of people are already performing regular homam. Though thes=
e are just the early days, the developments are amazing. Some of them are l=
aymen who never even lit a lamp and did not know how to do ANY pooja or rit=
ual. It is a miracle that such people are doing a homam everyday, like the =
rishis and Brahmanas of yore. I also know personally that some people doing=
 homam for a couple of years are actually starting to experience things wit=
hin and outside and, more importantly, going through rapid internal transfo=
rmation.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>I am neither a missionary nor a mercenary. I d=
o not sell anything to anyone, nor do I force
 anything on anyone. I just f=
reely share what I know, what I saw and what I am inspired to share. The re=
st is not in my hands.<BR><BR>I want to respectfully, humbly and lovingly i=
nvite those who have even an iota of interest to check out the homam websit=
e! If one gets into the habit of performing homam regularly, it has the gre=
at potential to transform one's life, materially and spiritually..<BR><BR>H=
