 1) That which appears [whatever it may be], let it appear; that which
disa=
ppears [whatever it may be],let it all disappear. What [loss or gain] is
it=
 to Self-knowledge?

That which remains after everything has entered and ce=
ased to exist in the
oneness [kevalam] of Siva =E2=80=93 who surges as the =
Whole [purnam] =E2=80=93 alone is
Self, one=E2=80=99s own nature.

2) The p=
ure knowledge which shines forth [as the sphurana =E2=80=98I-I=E2=80=99] wh=
en that
deceitful ego is scrutinized [through the enquiry =E2=80=98Who is t=
his I?=E2=80=99] and
destroyed,which the Upanishads praise as the glorious =
darshan of Siva=E2=80=99s
dance and which is the true clarity of God=E2=80=
=99s Grace, alone is the form of
Self.

3) Sages say that the state [or pla=
ce] in which the thought =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 [the ego]
does not rise even i=
n the least,alone is Silence [mouna] or Self
[swarupa]. [That]
silent Self =
alone is God; Self alone is the jiva; Self alone is this ancient
world.

4)=
 Knowing that whatever is known objectively as =E2=80=98this=E2=80=99 or =
=E2=80=98that=E2=80=99 is
[nothing but] an imagination of the mind, if one =
remains still [summa
irukka] in that which is neutral [i.e. if one remains =
merely as =E2=80=98I am=E2=80=99, the
neutral consciousness which does not =
objectively know any second or third
person], that reality which [then] shi=
nes forth alone is
existence-consciousness [satchit],the supreme and great =
Self.

Sadhu Om: Sri Bhagavan here condemns the way in which scholars waste=
 their
time by reading,learning by heart, discussing and endlessly arguing =
about
the details regarding how the universe is created from the five
eleme=
nts,regarding the functioning of the pranas, jnanendriyas,karmendriyas,
nad=
is and so on in the body, regarding the various kinds of jivas, and
regardi=
ng all the other innumerable such classifications given in the
scriptures.
=

Since all these principles or tattvas are only second or third persons, th=
e
non-Self [anatma], one should not waste one=E2=80=99s time in scrutinizin=
g them, but
should instead scrutinize Self, the only real principle, throug=
h the enquiry
