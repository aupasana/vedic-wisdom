Namaskarams to all fellow followers of this wonderful group and Happy Navra=
tri..

Couple of days back I was performing the Chandi Homam when I realise=
d that your inner most doubts / fears are taken care by the divine mother b=
y default .. You dont have to even think about it ..if its there it will be=
 taken care of .. Of course only if it really needs to be taken care of and=
 if she deems it to be so..

I usually perform homam with the 1,2,4,5 and t=
he 11th Chapters since I am still learning the recitation of the remaining =
chapters. This day I brought 1 Kg of Dry Cocunuts for the homam along with =
some jaggery  .sesame seeds etc.. I usually use cocunuts for majority of th=
e chapters along with the other materials for the 11th chapter since Cocunu=
ts help to burn the items nicely.. I make every thing ready the previous ni=
ght so that I dont have to run around in the early morning (5 AM) when I do=
 the homam....I prepare the other prasadam like Jaggery,Sesame seeds,Pomegr=
anate seeds,Puffed rice etc just before starting the homam.. For some stran=
ge reason I forgot this part so all that I was left with were the cocunut p=
ieces .. I did not realise this till I was already well into the 2 or 3rd c=
hapter.. I didnt want to stop in between the homam for preparing the second=
 prasadam..


While performing the homam I realised in between that I might=
 fall well short of the cocunut pieces much before the completion of the 11=
th chapter and I might have to take a break to make some other prasadam and=
 was hoping deparately that this will not happen... But wonder of wonders t=
o my surprise the last cocunut piece offered was also the last sloka of the=
 11th Chapter... This might well be a coincidence but the probability of th=
is happening is very rare considering that the number Navarna mantra and Ga=
nesh Pooja offerings at the begining of the homam are something which I don=
t keep count of... A very simple instance of how the mother has prempted th=
e fear in advance.. 

Regards,
Girish S
