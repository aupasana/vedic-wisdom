You can do a=
bhishekham and shivaling puja before the homam but don't mix
them up in the=
 same ritual.  I am not an expert on shivalinga worship
but there are detai=
led descriptions provided for in the Shiva Purana
with specific mantras for=
 worshiping the linga and what material to use
for abhishekham.  There are =
simple methods (just doint the panchakshari
and offering liquids such as mi=
lk, water, honey, ghee, sandle paste and
juice) and detailed ones such as R=
udraabhiskhekam and you can may your
way up from the simple to the comple a=
s you gain more knowledge and
guidance.

You will need to open the doors and have some cross ven=
tilation as
otherwise regular homam will cause some soot deposit or blackne=
ss on the
edges of the wall.  Since you live in Texas it should not be an i=
ssue to
open the doors and windows for most of the year.

So you mean 1/2 of a single 'tablet' or 1/2 of the entire pack?


If you bu=
rn 1/2 pack you will have to call the fire department !  I am
talking about=
 1/2 of a single tablet.

Start with Mahaganapati =
Homam and do it for a few months and you will
know when you are ready to mo=
ve on to other Homams.  If you strongly
identify with Siva then the Siva Ho=
mam and even Homam with Sri
Rudram/Chamakam (Rudra Homam) and rituals such =
as Rudra Abhishekham
would suit you very well.  Once you perform Mahaganapa=
ti Homam for a few
months you will gain confidence and protection before yo=
u move on to
Shiva Homams.  Mahaganapati is a gentle diety and so you shoul=
d not have
any "raw experiences" or have very little thereof.

Just from your e=
mail I can sense a very strong emotional side to you so
you seem to have a =
strong Moon Channel which is great for Bhakti so
wearing the copper Shiva b=
racelet on the left side may be giving you
some required balance.  Once you=
 start doing Homa your right side will
get more active also since you are d=
ealing with agni and this will
further balance the strong emotional left ch=
annel in your body.

Understand the differences between the horizontal lines, the dot, the
=
lines used by the vaishnavites (u shaped), and other forms of tilaka. 
If y=
ou feel comfortable with the horizontal lines then do that.
