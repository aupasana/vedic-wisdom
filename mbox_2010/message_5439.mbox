Namaste friends,
 
I am forwarding one more mail that was cc'ed to vedic-wi=
sdom but undelivered.
 
My own take is that politeness, when it is just a s=
how-off to look good, is not saattwik or useful. If one is seething with an=
ger and yet behaves politely to show off one's "gentle nature", it is not t=
hat useful. Similarly, if one is calm and composed inside and yet behaves f=
iercely, it may still be saattwik.
 
More than what we do, why we do it and=
 with what attitude we do it is important. We should all try to search insi=
de to find our dharma and engage in actions to fulfil our dharma. Unfortuna=
tely, it is not easy to find one's dharma. One's vision of one's dharma is =
corrupted by one's conditioning. As one fulfills more and more of one's dha=
rma with less and less ego identification, slowly conditioning drops off an=
d the clarity with which one sees one's dharma increases. This is a long pr=
ocess.
 
Somebody who criticizes me as a person in darkness and trying to b=
ecome a guru may genuinely feel that he is doing his dharma. If my sense of=
 dharma impels to be harsh and fight with that person, I will. But, in this=
 case, my sense of dharma tells me to take it easy and that is why I show r=
estraint.
 
In general, dharma towards oneself (one's body, name etc) is le=
ss important than dharma towards one's family (physical family, intellectua=
l family and spiritual family), larger society and universe. Sadly, we ofte=
n spend a lot of our energy fulfilling dharma towards ourselves (body, name=
 etc).
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
