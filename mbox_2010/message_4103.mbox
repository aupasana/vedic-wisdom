Dear Raj Garu,

Regarding Free-will And Destiny

Bhagavan Ramana once expla=
ined: "*The only freedom one has is to strive for
and acquire the Jnana whi=
ch will enable him not to identify himself with the
body. *The body will go=
 through the actions rendered inevitable by prarabdha
(destiny) based on th=
e balance sheet of past lives, and a man is free either
to identify himself=
 with the body and be attached to the fruits of its
actions or to be detach=
ed from it and be a mere witness of its activities."

*In verse 19 of Ullad=
u Narpadu ramana says* that the dispute whether fate
(vidhi) or free will (=
mati) prevails is of interest only to those who do not
know the (mulam) =E2=
=80=94 the root, base, foundation, origin or source =E2=80=94 of both
fate =
and free will (namely the mind, which misuses its free will and
experiences=
 whatever fate results therefrom), and that those who have known
the truth =
of this mind have thereby separated themselves from fate and free
will and =
will not hereafter become entangled with them again.In other
words, *fate a=
nd free will appear to exist only so long as our mind appears
to exist, but=
 when we scrutinise this mind and thereby know the truth that
it does not r=
eally exist, fate and free will will also cease to exist.*


*Below talk ca=
n give more information about ramana maharshi's views about
how Prarabdha k=
arma originated.*

Devotee: =E2=80=9CFor karma there must be a beginning, b=
ut how it began, no one has
mentioned.=E2=80=9D

Bhagavan: =E2=80=9CYes, bu=
t it is the same thing. If you are asked =E2=80=98how did you get
this?=E2=
=80=99 you say you have got it by =E2=80=98doing=E2=80=99 (karma). How were=
 you born? By
=E2=80=98doing=E2=80=99 (karma) that is all that could be sai=
d. If, however, you ask how was
this karma born, you are told you should no=
t ask such questions.

*This is known as the Law of the seed and the tree (=
bija ankura nyayam). The
tree is born of the seed; again from the tree a se=
ed is born. Where is the
origin of that seed? That is a question which you =
are told is not to be
asked. What can we say to that? That is why I always =
ask people to find out
first how they were born and where they were born.=
=E2=80=9D*


*Also in Guru Vachaka Kovai it is written*

*Prarabdha, like a=
 whirlwind, relentlessly agitates and spins the mind that
has shrunk throug=
h the =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99 idea. However, it cannot stir, even
s=
lightly, the limitation-free mind that shines as the extremely clear space
=
of being-consciousness when that ego-impurity [the =E2=80=98I am the body=
=E2=80=99 idea] is
destroyed by self-enquiry. (Guru Vachaka Kovai, vv. 703,=
 698)*
