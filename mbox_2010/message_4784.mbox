Narasimha Garu,

I am reading this very early in the morning and i thank mo=
ther for that. very inspiring and well timed explaination. This is of great=
 importance because it can be shown to crictics who comment nastily on Kris=
hna-Gopi relationship and also its for us to undersatnd and appreciate, atl=
east intellectually.

When i read such marvel from you, i try hard to contr=
ol myself not to be appreciative but i fail some times.

As you reprimanded=
 me in a different message, I will try to control *Flamboyance* (though whe=
n i praise, it's always genuine and never sycophancy) and try to keep quite=
, however with your blessings, Sadhana goes on mostly continuously.

***
On=
e more important thing to Share:
I've noticed since few days or may be a co=
uple of weeks, a unique thing- I use a normal drinking water in my Chandi H=
omam. at the end of homam i take a little water out of the copper container=
 as "Prasaad" and it really tests very different. It tests like a rose flav=
oured water (Like Gulaabjala). i could notice it but then i thought it woul=
d be my mental creation. It is to be noticed that i do not use Flowers many=
 a times now. i just offer Akshatas as substitutes.
Now yesterday, a small =
boy of 8 years age was also present in the Homam. after Homam when i gave l=
ittle of the water to everybody including him, he immediately said that the=
 water is testing like a Rose flavoured and 2 more people presetnt in the H=
omam also said the same thing and then i thought that i was right in feelin=
g difference in the water. Though there may be science which can exlain thi=
s but one thing for sure that the water after homam is transformed and test=
s and smells also very very nice. (Yesterday also there were no flowers)

B=
est Regards,

Utpal

 There is nothing inherently wrong or sinful in a naked body. It is not an =
object of lust by itself, though it may seem like an object of lust to a mi=
nd conditioned with lust. Even if such a conditioned person takes sannyasa =
and remains in a forest for 30 years away from everybody, he may feel lust =
if he suddenly sees a beautiful naked body after those 30 years of brahmach=
arya. On the other hand, when an evolved yogi who overcame this conditionin=
g sees a beautiful naked body, he may not close eyes and run away. He may n=
otice its beauty (just like one may notice the beauty of a roadside scenery=
 or waterfall or snowfall over a mountain or a sunrise over a lake etc) and=
 appreciate the Creator for creating objects of infinite variety and beauty=
. Thoughts of lust (e.g. I can do so and so thing with this body, it will b=
e nice to do so and so thing with this body, etc) may not even arise in his=
 mind!

 and talking about a scenery or a waterfall or snowfall over a mountain or =
sunrise over a lake that they saw.

 them, there was no need to cover her breasts. Clothes represent covering b=

 a Lalita idol with kumkum (sacred red vermillion powder). You better not s=
