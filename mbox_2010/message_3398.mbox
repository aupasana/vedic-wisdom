 Question: What is the purpose of creation?

Ramana Maharshi: It is to give=
 rise to this question. Investigate the answer
to this question, and finall=
y abide in the supreme or rather the primal
source of all, the Self. The in=
vestigation will resolve itself into a quest
for the Self and it will cease=
 only after the non-Self is sifted away and
the Self realized in its purity=
 and glory.

There may be any number of theories of creation. All of them e=
xtend
outwardly. There will be no limit to them because time and space are
=
unlimited. They are however only in the mind. If you see the mind,time and
=
space are transcended and the Self is realized.

Creation is explained scie=
ntifically or logically to one's own satisfaction.
But is there any finalit=
y about it? Such explanations are called
krama-srishti [gradual creation]. =
On the other hand, drishti-srishti
[simultaneous creation] is yugapat-srish=
ti. Without the seer there are no
objects seen. Find the seer and the creat=
ion is comprised in him. Why look
outward and go on explaining the phenomen=
a which are endless?
