=
=C2=A0 
Namaste friends,

A member of this group gifted me a book when he m=
et me for a saamoohika Satya 
Narayana vratam we conducted at Cary, North C=
arolina last year. I finally got to 
read a little from it. I am impressed =
with this work.

The book is called "Invading the Sacred: An Analysis of Hi=
nduism Studies in 
America" (editors: Krishnan Ramaswamy, Antonio de Nicola=
s and Aditi Banerjee). 
It has 29 scholarly articles organized in 4 section=
s.

Perverted scholars with perverted anti-Hindu agendas that look down upo=
n India 
and Hinduism with a colonial viewpoint have conducted perverted re=
searches in 
the name of academic freedom at the religious studies departme=
nts of western 
universities, published them and gained name and fame, tram=
pling the sacred in 
the process. Crying foul or getting frustrated with th=
is will not improve the 
situation or solve the problem. Interested religio=
us scholars have to firmly and 
patiently crtique these works in the same a=
cademic style, in order to reclaim 
the rightful place for Hinduism.

Sever=
al papers in this book do exactly that. They take specific works by western=
 
scholars and rebut them quite well and show how they are fallacious, hast=
y, 
nonsensical or sometimes downright manipulative or filled with lies.

*=
 * *

I will just give an example of the offensive work that was rebutted i=
n this 
book. [Warning: Those who are sensitive to offensive writings shoul=
d skip the 
next three paragraphs.]

Jeffrey Kripal from Univ of Chicago vi=
sited Ramakrishna Mission in West Bengal 
and did research on Ramakrishna P=
aramahamsa. Several people there 
enthusiastically helped him in the resear=
ches. In the end, what he produced is 
utterly nonsensical and filled with =
lies. He published his PhD dissertation 
without showing it to Ramakrishna =
Mission people to check for factual or 
linguistic inaccuracies. Ramakrishn=
a mission people found out about what he 
produced only years later, after =
his book "Kali's Child" based on the PhD 
dissertation won great acclaim in=
 the West. He won an award at the Americal 
Academy of Religion for that bo=
ok, landed a job at Harvard and his book was 
sadly mentioned in the Encycl=
opedia Britannica as the *number one* choice for 
learning about Ramakrishn=
a.

In the book, he portrayed Ramakrishna as a sexually perverted person, a=
 
homosexual and a pedophile. He did not know Bengali or Hindi or Sanskrit =
well 
and did not take help from any Bengali people at the Mission for this=
 work. He 
used his own faulty translations, willful distortions and manipu=
lation of 
sources to arrive at sensational (and damning) conclusions. For =
example, he 
translated a word that means "lap" as "genitals", in the conte=
xt of Swami 
Brahmananda (spiritual son of Ramakrishna and a young boy then=
) sitting in 
Ramakrishna's lap. He translated a word that means "touching =
softly" as 
"uncontrollably rubbing sandalpaste on the penises of boys".

E=
ven in places where there was no material to mis-translate, he simply 
spec=
ulated! For example, he speculated on the meeting of Totapuri and 
Ramakris=
hna, in which the naaga sadhu (naked ascetic) Totapuri taught advaita 
veda=
nta to Ramakrishna and made him go beyond Mother Kali and experience 
nirvi=
kalpa samadhi: "What it must have been like for Ramakrishna, a homosexually=
 
oriented man, to be shut away for days in a small hut with another, stark=
-naked 
man. Vedanta instruction or not, it was this man's nudity, and more=
 especially, 
his penis, that normally caught Ramakrishna's attention. How =
could it not?" 
Please note that he is not referring to any source and mis-=
translating it, but 
simply speculating based on his perverted agenda!

* *=
 *

If you see the book, you will see many examples of such pseudo-scholars=
hip 
driven by heinous agendas. It is a fact that many perverted people und=
er asuric 
influences make their livelihood, money and fame lying and sprea=
ding falsehoods 
about Hinduism, Hindu deities and Hindu saints.

Those who=
 are not inclined to fight a dharma yuddha against this may ignore this 
an=
d go on doing their sadhana. After all, if enough people do sadhana to 
str=
engthen sanatana dharma, this kind of things will automatically weaken. 
Ho=
wever, some scholars engaging these pseudo-scholars academically is really =

required on the ground. We need to give our encouragement to the pioneers =
who 
are doing this important scholarly rebuttal.

Best regards,
Narasimha
