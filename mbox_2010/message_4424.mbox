 1. Thinking is a mentation (vritti) ; being is not a mentation ! If
enquir=
ed =E2=80=98Who thinks ?=E2=80=99, thinking will come to an end ! Even when=
 thoughts
do not exist, do not you exist? To remain thus in the source of t=
houghts is
the state of Self- abidance (nishtha) ! Be thus!

2 He who think=
s is the individual soul (jiva); he who is,is the Supreme
(brahman) ! If th=
e thinker thinks with great love of That which is still,
this thought, the =
love to be, will become the thought free thought which
kills all thinking. =
When the thinker thus dies with all his thoughts, to
remain surviving him i=
s union with the Supreme (siva-sayujyam) !

3. He who thinks =E2=80=98I (am=
 so-and-so)=E2=80=99 is himself one among the thoughts. Of
all thoughts, th=
e thought =E2=80=98I (am so-andso)=E2=80=99 is the very first. The jiva who=

thinks =E2=80=98I (am so-and- -so)=E2=80=99 is only our reflection. For, w=
e never think =E2=80=98I
(am this or that)=E2=80=99 when we shine as That (=
the Supreme).

4. This thought, =E2=80=98I (am the body)=E2=80=99, does not=
 exist in deep sleep. This
thought, =E2=80=98I (am the body)=E2=80=99, does=
 not exist in the true state of jnana
either. Since it rises and slips away=
 in between (two such states), this =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99
is unreal;hence, th=
is =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 is only a thought.

5. The waxing of this thought =
=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 is indeed the waxing of misery! This
thought =E2=80=98I=
=E2=80=99 alone is what is called the ego.It is only because of
non-enquiry=
 that this =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 has come into existence and is flourishing !=
 If,
instead of being favoured, it is enquired into, =E2=80=98What is this =
!?=E2=80=99, it will
disappear, losing its existence.

6. The second and th=
ird persons (the objects) live only because of the root,
the first person (=
the subject or ego).If the fickle mind turns towards the
first person, the =
first person will become non-existent and That which
really exists will the=
n shine forth. This indestructible, real Self is
Jnana.

7. To think of sec=
ond and third persons is sheer foolishness, for by
thinking of second and t=
hird persons the mental activities (mano-vritlis)
will wax. (On the other h=
and,) attending to the first person is equal to
committing suicide, for onl=
y by enquiring into the first person will the ego
itself die.

8. Attending=
 to second and third persons instead of turning towards and
attending to th=
e first person is an attention based only upon ignorance
(ajnana). If you a=
sk, =E2=80=9CThen is not the attention to the ego also an
attention based u=
pon ignorance? So why should we attend to this =E2=80=98I?=E2=80=99, then
l=
isten.

9. The reason why this =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 dies when enquired into,=
 =E2=80=98What am I? is as
follows: This thought =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 is a r=
eflected ray of Jnana (Self), (and it alone
is directly connected with Self=
, whereas the other thoughts are not); (so)
when the attention goes deeper =
and deeper within along the ray =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, its
length decreases m=
ore and more, and when the ray I=E2=80=99 dies that which shines
as =E2=80=
=98I=E2=80=99 is Jnana.

10. Do not perform any action thinking =E2=80=98It=
 should be done by me=E2=80=99. Nothing is
done by you, (for) you are simpl=
y nothing ! By knowing this first, if you
avoid the rising of doership, the=
n everything will be done well by Him and
your peace will remain undisturbe=
d !

11. When scrutinizing =E2=80=98What is real?=E2=80=99, nothing in the =
world is (found to be)
real; Self alone is real (satyam).Therefore, let us =
renounce everything and
ever remain unshakably as the reality (sat). This a=
lone is the service
enjoined upon us by Sri Ramana, our eternal Lord!
