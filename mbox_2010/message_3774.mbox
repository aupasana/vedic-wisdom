 If you want butter, you must curdle the milk and set it in a place where no
one can disturb it; otherwise the curd will not stand. Then churn it and the
butter will rise. Similarly the neophyte should sit in solitude and not be
disturbed by worldly-minded people; then through the churning of the settled
mind by the practice of meditation the butter of Divine Love will be
acquired.

If you give your mind to God in solitude, you will obtain the spirit of true
renunciation and absolute devotion. If you give the same mind to the world,
it will grow worldly and think of woman and gold. The world may be likened
to water, and the mind to milk. Pure milk once mixed with water cannot be
separated from it; but if it is first turned into butter and then placed in
water, it can remain separate.

Let the milk of your mind be turned into the butter of Divine Love by means
of religious practices in solitude. The mind then will never get mixed with
the water of worldliness, but will rise above and remain unattached to the
world. Having attained true knowledge and devotion the mind will stand apart
from the world.
