Namaste Narasimha Garu,

>If one indeed does 1000 times Gayatri (or any man=
tra for a couple >of hours)

Count is Important or Time?. How much 'Same Pl=
ace' and 'Same time' adds to the degree of success and if they are really i=
mportant then people who travel will not be able to maintain both of them o=
r atleast one of them (I.E. Same place condition)

Sending you personal mes=
sage. you can forward it to list if question can help others.

Best Regards=
,

Utpal

    This is a great mail and very inspiring. However, I have one question o=
n Sri Manishji's advise on how to carry out the sadhana. He says do it for =
100 days and repeat the whole procedure for 3 times. So, should we do 3000 =
times japam in a day for 100 days or do 1000 times every day for=C2=A0300 d=
ays? He also says 'Grow a beard'. Now, in a professional corporate life, th=
at could be a difficult thing. How about trimming it?.... just to be tolera=
ble to other people. Maybe my question is silly but it is genuine.
