Dear Narasimha, Sanjay and others
 
G=
anesha. Why should one worship Ganesha or Rudra or Chandika or Mahakala.
In=
 fact can anybody actually worship any deity.
 
1. The fact of the matter i=
s that one's mind will be drawn to the worship of deities which one has wor=
shipped in past lives.
2. But, whether one will achive or not with that asp=
ect of the divine is based on
  a. What is the residue of karmas which one =
has left? Karana Shareera basically is responsible for this.One in a millio=
n
      individuals will achieve the burning of the Karana Shareera. But wh=
en this is being done, then every karma done to that person
     to his bod=
y or mind, good or bad must have an almost hundred times more intensity res=
ult, like for like.
     
  b. What is the intensity of the desire of that =
person for the Divine Beloved?
      Which again boils down to the amount o=
f karmas left in that Karana Shareera. The thicker the overlay of karmas, t=
he lesser the  desire to actually perform any kind of worship.
 
People tal=
k about mantras, mahamantras, and all this.
I find that it simply does not =
matter.
Every mantra is a name (nam), every nam has a form (rupa).
So, when=
 the mantra is chanted, the rupa is forming.
Where is the rupa forming?
In =
the physical body, mind, koshas and everywhere.
So the deity will actually =
occupy the person.
But when can this happen?
Only when the body is dead. No=
t dead physically, but in a different sense.
ie. ASANA: the mind forgets th=
e body exists after a few hours of sitting really still for a few hours a d=
ay.
    Pranayana: the mind reflects on the breath and feels it is alive, i=
t tries to still the breath.
    Dhyana, the rupa of the deity forms in the=
 mind, remember the body is dead for the mind at this stage.
    Dharana: T=
he mind percieves that form of God which is the object of the consciousness=
, but duality exists.
    Pratyahara: a phenomenon where the eyes do not se=
e, the ears do not hear.
    Samadhi: the rupa is so well established, that=
 the ultimate form of that rupa, that mantra, the Nirguna manifests.
 
So t=
he emptiness must come about in the mind and body about one's own identity =
before God fills it up with His form.
So, mantra is simply a tool to make u=
s realise God. Anybody can do mantras, but most people's internal fire or A=
gni is
not really charged up to digest these.
Japa is no doubt great, but i=
t is involved with the purification of air, whereas fire is involved in the=
 purification of internal fire.
When internal fire is purified, then the ab=
ility to visualise your deity becomes stronger. Hence homam in this age is =
easy and moreover, Agni is a living God, pratyaksha Devata who can be seen =
by your physical eyes.
It moves, eats, talks with the sadhaka and finally w=
hen it dies, it continues to live on within the sadhaka.
In Kali Yuga, this=
 ability to call a living God into the house is so powerful and so exhaltin=
g that later on japa after homam
brings very fast results.
Why Ganesha? Mos=
t people do not want spirituality, and in any case are not destined to be s=
piritual in this lifetime, so the only way they will pursue some sadhana is=
 if they are given some material result quite quickly by their sadhana.
Tho=
se who have problems in career, litigation, problems with marriage or in fi=
nding life partner, problems with education or speech can really advance th=
eir mundane satisfaction with Ganapati homa.
I have seen this numerous time=
s myself with people who are in this movement and outside.
That is not to s=
ay that Ganapati can't give Mukti. The ultimate form of Ganapati is the wor=
d of God.
And He is sakshama in giving Mukti as well.
 
The mahamantras are=
 many and I agree that some may say that lets do this(mahamantras) first.
B=
UT,
The Vedic mahamantras require the kind of intonation so perfect with vi=
sualisation at different bits of the body with various syllables, that for =
most people this is not feasible, especially since their Sanskrit itself is=
 somewhat imperfect.(remember name is form, if name is not repeated properl=
y then how will the form be?)(example, of someone who repeated bhakshati fo=
r rakshati in Pune many years ago).
And then there are mahamantras which ar=
e ok with almost any intonation. If someone wants to follow this that is al=
so ok.
But, with any mantra sadhana, Ganesha sadhana is anivarya. Because, =
the entrance to Shakti at Sushumna is guarded by Him.
 
Again some doubt co=
mes into people's heads about some mantras harming them when recited:
If so=
mebody experiences bad things when a mantra of a certain deity is recited t=
hen all it means is that the karmas of the Karana shareera are being dealt =
with(by the deity) quite fast, so they have to be experienced. It actually =
means that the Devata is close and more intense sadhana is needed.
 
Actual=
ly, all this business about mantra and mahamantra is immaterial, Allah mali=
k Hai, voh sab janta hai.
Us parvardigar se prarthana kar, woh sab raste kh=
ol deta hai.
