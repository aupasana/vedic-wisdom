Namaste everyone, 

I have a question on the solar-eclipse that is happenin=
g on Jan 15th in India. I am from AP, where there is a tradition of putting=
 the 'Bommala Kolu' for Makara Sankranthi, just like tamils do it during th=
e Dussera. I was surprised to know that many people are avoiding putting th=
e 'Kolu' this year because of eclipse. I am wondering if this is reasonable=
 enough! On one hand we hear that it is good to do japam, homam during ecli=
pse and on the other hand, they attribute some evil effects to eclipses, wh=
y? Sri Narasimha Garu or others, please explain.

Nagraj
