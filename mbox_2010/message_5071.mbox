Aditi Ji

A very heartfelt thanks for the immense effort your group put in =
publishing the book. It is sad that Wendy Doniger and her Ilk occupy import=
ant positions in universities like Harvad and Chicago school of religion.

=
Utpali Ji

You will be surprised to know that this policy of promoting Anti=
 Hindu scholars has an official sanction.This activity is often sponsored h=
eavily by many Left Wing orgs who have made it a point to potray everything=
 from the Vedas as barbaric rantings.

Famous example is the 2007 Californi=
a Textbook case vs Harvard University Sanskrit Chair ( Michael Witzel ) who=
 has been tom toming the now debunked Aryan Invasion theory to be included =
as course material for High school students.

Even in India the Jawahar Neh=
ru University is a hotbed of these elements with Profs like Romila Thapar w=
ho have made it a point of Slandering Lord Srirama in her works.

These are=
 the very professors who will author textbooks for NCERT to be used in Cent=
ral schools in India. These are the very professors who will get grants in =
the Western World.You will only get a grant in you potray santana dharma th=
is way both in the west or in India.

People like Prof U R rao of the Dwara=
ka discovery will not get money. Prof Lal of the Ayodhya exacavation discov=
ery will not get money....

And then we have the pseudo secular crowd who w=
ill pipe in with ...what does it matter anywaz . It matters a lot if right =
knowledge is to be transmitted to the next generation.


:) Whether one bel=
eives it not a silent Dharma yuddha has been going on with Sanatana dharma =
being attaked by the Marxist devils on one side and the Christian organizat=
ions on the other side.


Regards
Vemparla Ram Kishore
