Many thanks for your valuable feedback and suggestions.

i understand that a blunder is committed during homam. i will again pray to
sri mahalakshmi devi to pardon my ignorance.

Homam was performed with a specific sankalpa asking Devi to nullify all the
obstacles in my horoscope that are causing delay in my marriage and enable
my grandparents to find a suitable alliance for me.

Now my mind is strongly inclined in performing a blunder-free mahalakshmi
homam in karthika month.i hope with the divine belssings of my guru , sri
raghavendra swamy, i should be able to do it. If there is any other
auspicious day in the near furute for conducting a mahalakshmi homam in the
near future, please suggest us.

i am sorry to say that most of the moderen day priests but not everyone are
very commercial in nature.Its my practical experience with them.IMO, its ok
if they demand more money from the clients but atleast they should try to
justify the poeple who approach them.

i am neither a brahmin nor my family has ever condcuted these kind of
religious rituals.so i dont know the Do-s and Dont-s while performing a
homam.

Sir, it would be more helpful if you can publish a list of Homa instructions
or 'things -to - remember while performing homam' (something like i was told
to put the offerings in the fire without spilling it on the edges of the
homakundam, having more fore than smoke as you said below, etc), key
ingredients of every homa,etc or please point me to the material if its
already existing somewhere so that we can raise our voice when something
during homam is getting devaiated from how it is intended to be done. Sorry
if its too much of an ask.

Again, your selfless efforts in spreading the Homam significance for the
benefit of entire universe is really appreciative and i sincerely wish that
your teachings should reach every nook and corner of the world.

Thanks and Regards,
Hima Bindu
