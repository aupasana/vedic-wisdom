 Krishna Bhikshu was a man of insatiable curiosity, keen intellect,
enthusi=
asm and energy. He was a precocious youth whose early studies created
a dis=
taste for religious literature. This lasted until he came under the
powerfu=
l influence of Ganapati Muni, who brought him to the Maharshi in
1929. He w=
as enchanted by the holy presence of the sage, but still wandered
about for=
 some years exploring the different spiritual traditions and
teachers of th=
e time. As the result of his wide study and long practice,
Krishna Bhikshu =
became convinced of the truths taught and lived by Sri
Ramana Maharshi and =
surrendered to him whole-heartedly.

He authored several important works in=
 Telugu, one being Sri Ramana Leela,
the most comprehensive biography of th=
e Maharshi. Amidst the chanting of
Arunachala Siva, Krishna Bhikshu breathe=
d his last on December 30, 1981.

OUR FAMILY was in some way or other alway=
s associated with religion and
spiritual searching. Brahmarsi Chivukula Ven=
kata Sastri, the husband of my
paternal aunt, had asked some of the questio=
ns recorded in the Ramana Gita.
When I was a child I often used to go to hi=
s house and there I saw for the
first time the photo of Bhagavan Ramana and=
 read Ramana Gita and other early
brochures.

I went to Arunachala for the =
first time with Sri Rami Reddi. We had our food
in the town and then went t=
o the Ashrama. In those days there was very
little there - a hut for Bhagav=
an and another over his mother's samadhi
(place of burial). Bhagavan had ju=
st finished his food and was washing his
hands. He looked at us intently. "=
Did you have your food?" He asked. "Yes,
we had it in town." "You could hav=
e had it here," he replied.

I stayed with him for three days. He made a gr=
eat impression on me. I
considered him to be a real Mahatma, although his w=
ays were very simple.
Most of the cooking was done by him in those days. Th=
e Ashrama lived from
hand to mouth and usually only rice and vegetable soup=
 were prepared. When I
was about to leave, I asked Bhagavan: "Bhagavan, kin=
dly show me a good
path." "What are you doing now?" he asked. "When I am in=
 the right mood, I
sing the songs of Tyagaraja and I recite the holy Gayatr=
i. I was also doing
some pranayama but these breathing exercises have upset=
 my health." "You had
better stop them. But never give up the Advaita Drist=
hi (non dual vision)."
At that time I could not understand his words.

I we=
nt to Benares for a month, returned to Pondicherry and spent five months
th=
ere. Wherever I would go people would find some fault or other with me:
"Yo=
u are too weak, not fit for yoga, you do not know how to concentrate, you
c=
annot hold your breath, you are unable to fast, you need too much sleep,
yo=
u cannot keep vigils, you must surrender all your property . . ." Only
Bhag=
avan asked for nothing, found fault with nothing. As a matter of truth,
the=
re was nothing in me that entitled me to his grace. But it did not matter
w=
ith Bhagavan. He wanted me, not my goodness. It was enough to tell him "I
a=
m yours", and for him to do the rest. In that way he was unsurpassed. The
s=
trange people he gathered around him! But those who gave themselves to him
=
and trusted him and did his bidding were overwhelmed by his immense
solicit=
ude and kindness.

In 1930 I visited Ramanasramam for the second time, and =
stayed a month. Our
life was very simple at that time. I would get up early=
 each morning, have
my bath near the well at Palitirtham, prepare sacrament=
al food on a small
stove and start worshipping the Lingam over Bhagavan's m=
other's samadhi.
Chinnaswami helped in the chanting. Bhagavan would make hi=
mself generally
useful. He would talk quite freely with us every night afte=
r food. They
would ply him with questions on philosophy and metaphysics. In=
 the evening
he would sit on a wooden cot near the well and gaze at Arunach=
ala in deep
silence. His face would glow with an inner radiance which would=
 appear to
increase with the deepening darkness. We were sitting all around=
 him, either
silently, or singing some song. Alamelamma would sometimes sin=
g from
Tiruppughazh. The silence and peace at those hours was quite remarka=
ble.

At night after dinner all the inmates of the Ashrama would collect ar=
ound
Bhagavan, and then he was our own, telling stories, answering question=
s,
dispelling doubts, laughing and joking. We never knew how late it was un=
til
Madhavaswami would go behind Bhagavan's back and give us signs that it =
was
time to allow Bhagavan some rest.

B. V. Narasimhaswami took up in thos=
e days the task of writing a book on
Bhagavan's life and was collecting mat=
erials for his work from devotees. The
first draft of the book was ready an=
d the author gave it to me to read. The
idea came to me that a similar book=
 should be written in Telugu. I got
Bhagavan's permission and, using Narasi=
mhaswami's manuscript for an outline,
got the Telugu version written within=
 a month.

After that, whenever there was some court holiday and I had enou=
gh money for
a railway ticket, I would come down to Ramanasramam. Everybody=
, including
Bhagavan, used to say: "Krishnayya has come," and there was alw=
ays a warm
welcome for me.

I asked him once: "You told me to repeat the Ga=
yatri. It is too long. Also,
I am expected to know its meaning and to medit=
ate on it.'' "Who asked you to
bother about the meaning and all that? I hav=
e only asked you to see who is
repeating the Gayatri, or who is the japi," =
was his kind reply.

On the other hand he did not limit his teaching to the=
 one question "Who am
I ?" He invariably adjusted his advice to the needs o=
f the devotee. He would
say: "Sooner or later the question 'Who am I?' will=
 have to be faced. All
that leads to this question is good. By itself nothi=
ng else is fully
effective, for Self-knowledge comes only through self-enqu=
iry. But other
methods purify the mind and help it to see its own limits. W=
hen the mind
comes to the end of its resources and stands baffled before th=
e unanswerable
question, then a Higher Power takes charge of the mind and t=
he Self stands
revealed, the Real, the Wonderful."

Once an old woman came =
to the Ashrama. She always carried with her a framed
picture of Bhagavan Na=
rayana and she would worship it on every occasion.

She asked Bhagavan whet=
her she was right in doing so. Bhagavan replied:

"Without name and form, o=
n what is one to concentrate? What you are doing
with your heart and soul i=
s just right for you."

One night there were only one or two persons in the=
 hall. Madhavaswami was
massaging Bhagavan's legs. A gentleman from Kakinad=
a asked Bhagavan's
permission to massage his legs. Bhagavan did not reply. =
The man repeated his
request, saying: "At home I am daily praying to Bhagav=
an and now I have a
chance to serve him." Suddenly Bhagavan thundered: "You=
 had all the chances
of serving me at home. Why did you come here?" The man=
 became quite
frightened and could not speak. Thus Bhagavan taught us not t=
o make a show
of our devotion.

Nobody could guess about the way Bhagavan w=
ould meet people. The high and
mighty of the land would not get even a blan=
k look, while some insignificant
looking wanderer would become the object o=
f his concentrated attention for
hours and days. On the other hand eminent =
people would sometimes be taken up
by him and given the immense blessing of=
 being the centre of his interest.
Once Pranavananda Swami came to the Ashr=
ama. He was utterly exhausted. He
sat on the steps of the temple and could =
not move any further. Bhagavan was
told about it. He came out at once, sat =
at the feet of Pranavananda Swami
and started rubbing his legs, saying: "Yo=
u had a long way to walk, Grandpa.
Your legs must be paining you very much.=
" The old swami protested in vain;
Bhagavan had his way and massaged the sw=
ami's feet.

At food time Bhagavan would ask to be served very little and h=
e would
carefully clear the plate of the last grain of food before getting =
up.
Although he never asked us to do the same, I asked him: "If we clear ou=
r
dining leaves so scrupulously, the dogs, cats, monkeys, rats and the ants=

will starve." Bhagavan answered: "Well, if you are so compassionate, why n=
ot
feed the animals before taking food yourselves? Do you think they relish=

your scrappings?"

Once a visitor said: "I have been coming to you, Swami,=
 many times, hoping
that something will happen and I shall be changed. So f=
ar I do not see any
change in me. I am as I was: a weakling of a man, an in=
veterate sinner." And
he started weeping piteously. "On this road there are=
 no milestones,"
replied Bhagavan. "How can you know which direction you ar=
e going ? Why
don't you do what the first-class railway passenger does? He =
tells the guard
his destination, locks the doors and goes to sleep. The res=
t is done by the
guard, If you could trust your guru as much as you trust t=
he railway guard,
it would be quite enough to make you reach your destinati=
on. Your business
is to shut the door and windows and sleep. The guard will=
 wake you up at
your destination."

One Rama Rao, an advocate in Nellore, w=
as requested many times by his
friends to come with them to Ramanasramam. I=
nvariably he would answer: "I
shall go when Bhagavan calls me.'' Once when =
he was praying Bhagavan
appeared to him and asked: "Why have you not come?"=
 Rama Rao immediately
left for Tiruvannamalai. Before reaching the Ashrama =
he had a dream in which
a unique Chakra (symbolic drawing) appeared before =
him. He told the dream to
Bhagavan, described the Chakra and asked who coul=
d help him in having one
drawn correctly. Bhagavan gave him all the necessa=
ry information. When the
Chakra was ready, Bhagavan examined it carefully a=
nd gave it to Rama Rao,
telling him to use it in his worship.

A widow arri=
ved one day, entered the Hall and bowed to Bhagavan. He looked
at her close=
ly and started laughing. "Oh, it is you.'' he said. The woman
got confused,=
 covered her face with her white widow's sari and hid herself
in a corner. =
Bhagavan continued with a broad smile: "When I was a boy her
people were ou=
r neighbours and she was their little girl. It was agreed
between our paren=
ts that she would be my wife in due course. I was very fond
of helping my m=
other in the kitchen and her mother used to grumble that she
would never ma=
rry her daughter to a fellow who likes to spend his day near
the stove, lik=
e a woman. Anyhow I was not fated to marry. But had I married
her, what wou=
ld have been my fate!" Everybody had a good laugh at Bhagavan's
narrow esca=
pe.

Once I said to Bhagavan: "Bhagavan, formerly, whenever I thought of yo=
u,
your form would appear before my eyes. But now it does not happen. What =
am I
to do?" "You can remember my name and repeat it. Name is superior to f=
orm.
But in the course of time even the name will disappear. Till then repe=
at the
name," advised Bhagavan.

An inmate of the Ashrama who had been serv=
ing Bhagavan for many years
started visiting a certain woman in the town. H=
er relatives came to know of
it and decided to catch and kill the man. One =
night they caught him at her
house, bound him hand and foot and locked him =
up in a room, postponing the
cutting of his throat until they had found a s=
afe way of disposing of the
body. Our man managed to escape and came runnin=
g to the Ashrama, pursued by
his enemies. When he entered the gate they gav=
e up the chase. He entered the
Hall trembling and fell on the ground shouti=
ng: "Save me, save me.''
Bhagavan ordered the doors to be shut and said: "D=
on't fear, tell me what
happened." After having been told everything, he lo=
oked at the culprit with
understanding and pity and said reassuringly: "Don=
't fear any more. Go and
sleep." From the next day the man was at his work =
and Bhagavan would not
mention the matter at all. Everybody in the town cam=
e to know what happened.
The Ashrama people requested Bhagavan to send the =
man away, for his presence
would tarnish the good name of the Ashrama. Bhag=
avan called the man and told
him in front of everybody: "You have done some=
 wrong, but you were too
foolish to keep it secret. Others do worse things,=
 but they take care not to
be caught. Now, the people who were not caught w=
ant you to leave the Ashrama
because you were caught. They will make your l=
ife miserable. You had better
stay outside for some time, until things sett=
le down." The man stayed with
some devotees outside the Ashrama and came ba=
ck after a few months.

When people would complain to Bhagavan about some m=
ischief or other done in
the Ashrama, Bhagavan would say: "I have not come =
here to punish people. If
I start punishing people, even a black crow would=
 not remain in this place.
People come here, each with his own purpose, and=
 each may find his purpose
fulfilled. Why don't you take care of your own p=
urpose? Why do you pay
attention to what others do?"

On some other occasio=
n Bhagavan remarked about some of the visitors: "On
their first visit to th=
e Ashrama they seem to be all right; on their second
visit they discover th=
at the Ashrama is not properly run; on their third
visit they start giving =
advice; on the fourth they know best how to run the
place; on the fifth the=
y discover that the management is not responsive and
they are very displeas=
ed; on the sixth they suggest that the present staff
should walk out, leavi=
ng the Ashrama to them. Finally they become
disheartened and blame me for w=
hat I have never done." After all it is
perfectly true that Bhagavan neithe=
r started nor organized the Ashrama. It
was all done by others who just did=
 what they thought right.

When Bhagavan was still on the hill, a postcard =
came in which the sender
wrote: "I am a poor elementary school teacher. My =
mother is old and my
salary is so small that I cannot look after her proper=
ly. Kindly see that I
get a raise." Bhagavan laughed and said: "Well, why n=
ot?" Another card came
after some time in which he wrote: "By your grace my=
 salary was increased.
Now there is a vacancy in a higher grade. If I am gi=
ven that grade, I shall
earn more and make my mother very happy." Bhagavan =
had a good laugh and
said: "Good." Again after some days, another card: "My=
 mother is bedridden
and there is nobody to nurse her. If I could get marri=
ed, my wife would look
after her. But I am a poor man. Who will give me his=
 daughter in marriage?
And where shall I get the money for expenses? Bhagav=
an may kindly arrange."
Bhagavan laughed and said: "Well, let it be so." Af=
ter some months another
postcard came: "By your kindness I was married quit=
e easily. My wife is
already with me. My mother wants a grandchild before s=
he dies. Please
provide. "Why not?" said Bhagavan. After some months anothe=
r card: "My wife
gave birth to a child, but she has no milk for it. I canno=
t afford milk for
the baby. Please get me a promotion." Then another card: =
"I got a promotion
and an increment. The child is doing well. I owe everyth=
ing to your
kindness." Bhagavan remarked: "What have I done? It is his good=
 karma that
all goes well with him." After some days another card: "Mother =
died. She
worshiped you before her death. "Well," said Bhagavan. After a mo=
nth,
another card: "Swami, my child has died." "Sorry," said Bhagavan. Anot=
her
month had passed and a card came saying: "My wife is pregnant again." T=
hen
another card: "My wife gave birth to a child. Both died." "Ram, Ram,'' =
said
Bhagavan. "Everything seems to be over." Then another card: "Due to fa=
mily
trouble my work was very irregular and I was dismissed. I am completel=
y
destitute now.'' Bhagavan said, heaving a deep sigh: "All that came has
g=
one; only his Self remained with him. It is always like this. When all
goes=
, only the Self remains."

What you are doing with your heart and soul is just right for you."<br=
><br>One night there were only one or two persons in the hall. Madhavaswami=
 was massaging Bhagavan's legs.=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-weight:bold">A=
 gentleman from Kakinada asked Bhagavan's permission to massage his leg=
s. Bhagavan did not reply. The man repeated his request, saying: "At h=
ome I am daily praying to Bhagavan and now I have a chance to serve him.&qu=
ot; Suddenly Bhagavan thundered: "You had all the chances of serving m=
e at home. Why did you come here?" The man became quite frightened and=
 could not speak. Thus Bhagavan taught us not to make a show of our devotio=
n.</span><br>

<br>Nobody could guess about the way Bhagavan would meet peo=
ple. The high and mighty of the land would not get even a blank look, while=
 some insignificant looking wanderer would become the object of his concent=
rated attention for hours and days. On the other hand eminent people would =
sometimes be taken up by him and given the immense blessing of being the ce=
ntre of his interest. Once Pranavananda Swami came to the Ashrama. He was u=
tterly exhausted. He sat on the steps of the temple and could not move any =
further. Bhagavan was told about it. He came out at once, sat at the feet o=
f Pranavananda Swami and started rubbing his legs, saying: "You had a =
long way to walk, Grandpa. Your legs must be paining you very much." T=
he old swami protested in vain; Bhagavan had his way and massaged the swami=
's feet.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">At food time Bhagava=
n would ask to be served very little and he would carefully clear the plate=
 of the last grain of food before getting up. Although he never asked us to=
 do the same, I asked him: "If we clear our dining leaves so scrupulou=
sly, the dogs, cats, monkeys, rats and the ants will starve." Bhagavan=
 answered: "Well, if you are so compassionate, why not feed the animal=
s before taking food yourselves? Do you think they relish your scrappings?&=
quot;</span><br>

<br>Once a visitor said: "I have been coming to you,=
 Swami, many times, hoping that something will happen and I shall be change=
d. So far I do not see any change in me. I am as I was: a weakling of a man=
, an inveterate sinner." And he started weeping piteously. "On th=
is road there are no milestones," replied Bhagavan. "How can you =
know which direction you are going ?=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-weight:bold">=
Why don't you do what the first-class railway passenger does? He tells =
the guard his destination, locks the doors and goes to sleep. The rest is d=
one by the guard, If you could trust your guru as much as you trust the rai=
lway guard, it would be quite enough to make you reach your destination. Yo=
ur business is to shut the door and windows and sleep. The guard will wake =
you up at your destination."</span><br>

<br>One Rama Rao, an advocate=
 in Nellore, was requested many times by his friends to come with them to R=
amanasramam. Invariably he would answer: "I shall go when Bhagavan cal=
ls me.'' Once when he was praying Bhagavan appeared to him and aske=
d: "Why have you not come?" Rama Rao immediately left for Tiruvan=
namalai. Before reaching the Ashrama he had a dream in which a unique Chakr=
a (symbolic drawing) appeared before him. He told the dream to Bhagavan, de=
scribed the Chakra and asked who could help him in having one drawn correct=
ly. Bhagavan gave him all the necessary information. When the Chakra was re=
ady, Bhagavan examined it carefully and gave it to Rama Rao, telling him to=
 use it in his worship.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">A widow a=
rrived one day, entered the Hall and bowed to Bhagavan. He looked at her cl=
osely and started laughing. "Oh, it is you.'' he said. The wom=
an got confused, covered her face with her white widow's sari and hid h=
erself in a corner. Bhagavan continued with a broad smile: "When I was=
 a boy her people were our neighbours and she was their little girl. It was=
 agreed between our parents that she would be my wife in due course. I was =
very fond of helping my mother in the kitchen and her mother used to grumbl=
e that she would never marry her daughter to a fellow who likes to spend hi=
s day near the stove, like a woman. Anyhow I was not fated to marry. But ha=
d I married her, what would have been my fate!" Everybody had a good l=
augh at Bhagavan's narrow escape.</span><br>

<br>Once I said to Bhagav=
an: "Bhagavan, formerly, whenever I thought of you, your form would ap=
pear before my eyes. But now it does not happen. What am I to do?" &qu=
ot;You can remember my name and repeat it.=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-weight:=
bold">Name is superior to form. But in the course of time even the name wil=
l disappear. Till then repeat the name," advised Bhagavan.</span><br>
=

<br>An inmate of the Ashrama who had been serving Bhagavan for many years =
started visiting a certain woman in the town. Her relatives came to know of=
 it and decided to catch and kill the man. One night they caught him at her=
 house, bound him hand and foot and locked him up in a room, postponing the=
 cutting of his throat until they had found a safe way of disposing of the =
body. Our man managed to escape and came running to the Ashrama, pursued by=
 his enemies. When he entered the gate they gave up the chase. He entered t=
he Hall trembling and fell on the ground shouting: "Save me, save me.&=
#39;' Bhagavan ordered the doors to be shut and said: "Don't f=
ear, tell me what happened." After having been told everything, he loo=
ked at the culprit with understanding and pity and said reassuringly: "=
;Don't fear any more. Go and sleep." From the next day the man was=
 at his work and Bhagavan would not mention the matter at all. Everybody in=
 the town came to know what happened. The Ashrama people requested Bhagavan=
 to send the man away, for his presence would tarnish the good name of the =
Ashrama.=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-weight:bold">Bhagavan called the man and =
told him in front of everybody: "You have done some wrong, but you wer=
e too foolish to keep it secret. Others do worse things, but they take care=
 not to be caught. Now, the people who were not caught want you to leave th=
e Ashrama because you were caught.</span>=C2=A0They will make your life mis=
erable. You had better stay outside for some time, until things settle down=
." The man stayed with some devotees outside the Ashrama and came back=
 after a few months.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">When people =
would complain to Bhagavan about some mischief or other done in the Ashrama=
, Bhagavan would say: "I have not come here to punish people. If I sta=
rt punishing people, even a black crow would not remain in this place. Peop=
le come here, each with his own purpose, and each may find his purpose fulf=
illed. Why don't you take care of your own purpose? Why do you pay atte=
ntion to what others do?"</span><br>

<br>On some other occasion Bhaga=
van remarked about some of the visitors: "On their first visit to the =
Ashrama they seem to be all right; on their second visit they discover that=
 the Ashrama is not properly run; on their third visit they start giving ad=
vice; on the fourth they know best how to run the place; on the fifth they =
discover that the management is not responsive and they are very displeased=
; on the sixth they suggest that the present staff should walk out, leaving=
 the Ashrama to them. Finally they become disheartened and blame me for wha=
t I have never done."=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-weight:bold">After all =
it is perfectly true that Bhagavan neither started nor organized the Ashram=
a. It was all done by others who just did what they thought right.</span><b=
r>

<br><span style=3D"font-style:italic">When Bhagavan was still on the hi=
ll, a postcard came in which the sender wrote: "I am a poor elementary=
 school teacher. My mother is old and my salary is so small that I cannot l=
ook after her properly. Kindly see that I get a raise." Bhagavan laugh=
ed and said: "Well, why not?" Another card came after some time i=
n which he wrote: "By your grace my salary was increased. Now there is=
 a vacancy in a higher grade. If I am given that grade, I shall earn more a=
nd make my mother very happy." Bhagavan had a good laugh and said: &qu=
ot;Good." Again after some days, another card: "My mother is bedr=
idden and there is nobody to nurse her. If I could get married, my wife wou=
ld look after her. But I am a poor man. Who will give me his daughter in ma=
rriage? And where shall I get the money for expenses? Bhagavan may kindly a=
rrange." Bhagavan laughed and said: "Well, let it be so." Af=
ter some months another postcard came: "By your kindness I was married=
 quite easily. My wife is already with me. My mother wants a grandchild bef=
ore she dies. Please provide. "Why not?" said Bhagavan. After som=
e months another card: "My wife gave birth to a child, but she has no =
milk for it. I cannot afford milk for the baby. Please get me a promotion.&=
quot; Then another card: "I got a promotion and an increment. The chil=
d is doing well. I owe everything to your kindness." Bhagavan remarked=
: "What have I done? It is his good karma that all goes well with him.=
" After some days another card: "Mother died. She worshiped you b=
efore her death. "Well," said Bhagavan. After a month, another ca=
rd: "Swami, my child has died." "Sorry," said Bhagavan.=
 Another month had passed and a card came saying: "My wife is pregnant=
 again." Then another card: "My wife gave birth to a child. Both =
died." "Ram, Ram,'' said Bhagavan. "Everything seems=
 to be over." Then another card: "Due to family trouble my work w=
as very irregular and I was dismissed. I am completely destitute now.'&=
#39; Bhagavan said, heaving a deep sigh</span>: "<span style=3D"font-w=

always like this. When all goes, only the Self remains."=C2=A0</span><=
