 It was a summer evening, and we were all sitting outside in the open space=

by the well. Suddenly one of the visitors started weeping bitterly.

'I am=
 a horrible sinner. For a long time I have been coming to you, but
there is=
 no change in me. Can I become pure at last? How long am I to wait?
When I =
am here near you, I am good for a time. But when I leave this place,
I beco=
me a beast again. You cannot imagine how bad I can be -- hardly a
human bei=
ng. Am I to remain a sinner forever?'

'Why do you come to me? What have I =
to do with you?' demanded Bhagavan.
'What is there between us that you shou=
ld come here and weep and cry in
front of me?'

The man started moaning and=
 crying even more, as if his heart were breaking.

'All my hopes of salvati=
on are gone. You were my last refuge and you say you
have nothing to do wit=
h me! To whom shall I turn now? What am I to do? To
whom am I to go?'

Bhag=
avan watched him for some time and said, 'Am I your Guru that I should
be r=
esponsible for your salvation? Have I ever said that I am your Master?'

'I=
f you are not my Master, then who is? And who are you, if not my Master?
Yo=
u are my Guru. You are my guardian angel. You must take pity me and
release=
 me from my sins!'

He started sobbing and crying again.

We all sat silent=
, overcome with pity. Only Bhagavan looked alert and
matter-of-fact.

'If I=
 am your Guru, what are my fees? Surely you should pay me for my
services.'=


'But you won't take anything,' cried the visitor. 'What can I give you?'
=

'Did I ever say that I don't take anything? And did you ever ask me what y=
ou
can give me?'

'If you would take, then ask me. There is nothing I would=
 not give you.'

'All right. Now I am asking. Give me. What will you give m=
e?'

'Take anything. Everything I have is yours.'

'Then give me all the go=
od you have done in this world.'

'What good could I have done? I have not =
a single virtue to my credit.'

'You have promised to give. Now give. Don't=
 talk of your credit. Just give
away all the good you have done in your pas=
t.'

'Yes, I shall give. But how does one give? Tell me how the giving is d=
one
and I shall give.'

'Say like this: "All the good I have done in the pa=
st I am giving away
entirely to my Guru. Henceforth I have no merit from it=
 nor have I any
concern with it." Say it with your whole heart.'

'All righ=
t, Swami. "I am giving away to you all the good I have done so far,
if I ha=
ve done any, and all its good effects. I am giving it to you gladly,
for yo=
u are my Master and you are asking me to give it all away to you.'

'But th=
is is not enough,' said Bhagavan sternly.

'I gave you all I have and all y=
ou asked me to give. I have nothing more to
give.'

'No, you have. Give me =
all your sins.'

The man looked wildly at Bhagavan, terror stricken.

'You =
do not know, Swami, what you are asking for. If you knew, you would not
ask=
 me. If you take over my sins, your body will rot and burn. You do not
know=
 me, you do not know my sins. Please do not ask me for my sins.'

He wept b=
itterly.

'I shall look after myself. Don't you worry about me,' said Bhaga=
van. 'All I
want from you is your sins.'

For a long time the bargain would=
 not go through. The man refused to part
with his sins. But Bhagavan was ad=
amant.

'Either give me your sins along with your merits, or keep both and =
don't
think of me as your Master."

In the end the visitor's scruples broke=
 down and he declared, 'Whatever sins
I have done, they are no longer mine.=
 All of them and their results, too,
belong to Ramana.'

Bhagavan seemed to=
 be satisfied. 'From now on there is no good nor bad in
you. You are just p=
ure. Go and do nothing, either good or bad. Remain
yourself. Remain what yo=
u are.'

A great peace fell over the man and over us all. No one knows what=
 happened
to the fortunate visitor, for he was never seen in the ashram aga=
in. He
might have had no further need to come.
