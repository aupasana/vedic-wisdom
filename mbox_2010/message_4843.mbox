Respected sir,



Namaste.


With the inspriration of "Do Homam Yourself" from Pujya Sri PVR Narasimha
rao garu, i thought it would be a gud idea to perform mahalakshmi homam
during sravana month friday and approached a brahmin priest for the same.

Lotus flowers dipped in honey, Bilva fruits, Bilva leaves and other flowers
were offered during the homa with 16 times recital of Srisuktham. With the
virtue of knowledge gained from your previous posts, which essentially said
that any sattvic material can be offered to gods in the homam fire, i took a
piece of red cloth and red bangles for the purnahuti.

This is the first time i participated/performed a homam and it was a great
spritual experience. i felt that i gained a lot of positive energy from the
homam. i strongly felt that my offerings reached mahalakshmi devi directly
through the homakunda. Such is the impact of your teaching about
Homam-significance on me! Thank you, sir.

However, my mind is slighlty disturbed over a co-priest's action during
homam. When the homam fire was weakened and about to extinguish, the priest
has blown air through his mouth directly into teh homa kundam to increase
the intensity of flames in it :(
i have heard from my grandmother that blowing air through mouth into a
flame/fire is equal to spitting on it and its a very unholy act. Since then
i desisted myself from celebrating my birthday by blowing candles too.

I wanted to stop this act of his..but again i thought that my 'fire
extinguishion(by blowing air through mouth)' knowledge may not be relevant
for the homam fire and i should not interfere with the priest,who seemed to
be well experienced in performing homams.

PLease comment something about this and enlighten us with your knowledge so
that i will be careful from next time. Also, if there are any other
ingredients specific for mahalakshmi homam, please suggest us.
