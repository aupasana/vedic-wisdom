Namaste:

I read that NASA bombed the moon in October 2009 to investigate
presence of water on it.  The impact was supposedly to kick up a plume
of debris rising as high as six miles (10 kilometers) above the lunar
surface and create a crater of a size equal to 1/3rd of a football
field.  Prior to October, a Japanese satellite collided with the moon.

Rishi's said "Yatha Pindae, Thatha Brahmandae", and I was wondering
how does these kind of "attacks" impact us? If space exploration
involved more of these kind of bombing (man made), does it not disturb
the planetary environment ? and in-turn affect us somehow ? some
energy imbalances ? mood change ?

Regards,
Hemanth
