Dear Narasimha and others,
=A0
Rajarshi, I hope you had a nice stay at Vara=
nasi with Manish. I see that your signature changed after the trip.
=A0
We =
had a remarkable time at Varanasi. 
=A0
The moment our flight landed at the=
 Kashi airport which is actually quite outside the main city of Kashi, Mani=
sh said there is something in here which is different. The energy is palpab=
le throughout. After checking in at the hotel we spend the time in roaming =
around the ghats, watching the evening Ganga Arati and shooting.
=A0
By 9 P=
M Manish decided on doing a Chandi homa, at the famous Manikarnika samshan,=
 on a funeral pyre. Sadhana in a samshan bhoomi is something that many grea=
t sadhakas in Hinduism have done before. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa used to pe=
rform various sadhanas in a samshan.Sri Trilanga Swami - a great siddha -=
=A0spent most of his days near the Manikarnik Samshan doing sadhana.=A0The =
effect that a Samshan has on the human consciousness can be apty used, for =
those who have such inclination, to further ones spiritual growth. The fire=
 of a funeral pyre is called kravyada agni, an impure form of fire unlike t=
he fire of a standard homa agni. However, there have been sadhakas, and man=
y in number, who has used the samshan agni to perform homas. They chose not=
 to make a distinction between pure and impure.If someone feels that a fune=
ral pyre is "unholy", he or she would be better off not trying anything in =
such a fire. The main deities of a samshan bhoomi are Mahakala and
 Mahakal=
i. 
=A0
=A0We went to buy some samagri - til (black and white), couple of=
=A0full coconuts, flowers, incense stick (agabatti), =A0kismis, havan samag=
ri. While buying the samagri from a shop inside a lane near the Vishwanath =
temple, suddenly a small begger child came and kept asking for food. There =
was a sweet shop on the other side of the lane, he pointed to the shop aski=
ng for food. Manish turned around, bought some food and gave it to the chil=
d. The child was eating when we turned back towards the shop from where we =
were buying the samagri. In a moment Manish asked me to check for the child=
, I turned round and found no one there. I looked in the lane and there was=
 no child anywhere. Just gone, vanished! I still remember the child very cl=
early. Manish smiled and said, " The deity of this place wanted to see whet=
her we=A0had become so big sadhakas that we=A0are unable to feed a hungry c=
hild=A0. That is how God comes to test people.=A0Kya pata Narayan kab, kaha=
 aur=A0kis
 roop me mil jaye."
=A0
At 11 pm we left for Manikarnik, dressed=
 in a combination of red and black. Walking along the ghats we reached the =
samshan at around eleven thirty. It was quite crowded, with=A0domes (people=
 who work there to help the bodies burn) and the relatives. There were at l=
east 8 to 10 pyres burning simultaneously. Right next to it was the Ganges,=
 pitch black at night. We sat on a stairs, waiting for the crowd to ease ou=
t a bit, not sure when that will happen, not sure=A0how people are going to=
 react. As we sat observing, the people too were observing us with a mix of=
 curiosity=A0and possible=A0apprehension.=A0Suddenly Manish closed his eyes=
 and meditated some time, then remarked that this place has a tremendous en=
ergy. Something of almost infinite abilities resides in this samshan bhoomi=
. A deity. While sayingf so he turned behind to look at something, I too tu=
rned. I could see nothing but blank space. But that very instant the dogs i=
n the samshan went running=A0to
 that direction.
=A0
After waiting like thi=
s for about an hour, we found a pyre where the relatives had left.The major=
 portion had been burnt already, but there was enough left to last for some=
 time still. We went and sat next to it. Manish started the homa. The offer=
ing was of til. I sat next to him doing the Chandi path, trying to be in sy=
nc with his recital. A part of my mind was also trying to adjust itself to =
the ambience. There were quite a few people around watching what we were up=
to. But no one disturbed. The dome had to come and take wood from the pyre =
to light other pyres. He did it in the most cautious manner possible, takin=
g pieces from the fringe of the pyre. After some time Manish indicated to h=
im not to take any more wood. The dome nodded his head and did not disturb =
that pyre again. 
=A0
Very soon, within half an hour I noticed that a pack =
of 4/5 dogs had come and were sitting around the pyre on which the homa was=
 being done. As=A0I=A0read the Chandi I felt a great pressure on my head, f=
rom all sides. As if a something was pressing hard on my skull, gripping it=
 tight. The concentration become excellent. I soon forgot who was watching =
us or anything else around me, except for the sound of the Chandi Path. Ver=
y nice meditation happened. The mind felt like as if it was a piece of iron=
 and there=A0was a huuuuge magnet nearby which just kept pulling the mind a=
way to some distant place, far, far away from the reality I am normally=A0a=
ccustomed to.=A0While the homa was on, suddenly=A0one black dog from the pa=
ck which was sitting nearby, sat up on two legs and kept starting at Manish=
. For I think about 10 mins it kept staring with it's head pointed in an an=
gular fashion. Its eyes and mannerism gave a feeling as if it is not an ani=
mal but a human being
 watching. Just staring and observing every action. M=
anish said Kala Bhairava had entered into the body of that dog.
=A0
The hom=
a finished at around 3 AM. The meditations both at the end as well as in be=
tween, were all excellent. The mind would just get pulled a few notches abo=
ve the ordinary with slightest bit of effort.
=A0
Simply being in a samshan=
 and observing the human body burning up has a powerful effect on the mind.=
 In a nearby pyre we saw the femur bones of a female human body burning. Bo=
th the femurs were visible and spread apart. In an ordinary setting, this k=
ind of a scene would mean a woman with "legs spread apart" which has a very=
 sexual connotation. In Manikarnik, on that night, it only evoked a feeling=
 of how eventually the body is merely a covering for something far more rea=
l and powerful that resides inside. The skin, flesh, bones etc will perish =
as they are ment to perish. Only Rama naam satya hai.
=A0
Manish said if yo=
ur intentions of going to a samshan bhoomi is merely to please God through =
sadhanas=A0- i.e you are not planning something negative nor desirous of pe=
tty mundane gains - there is very little chance that you will ever come to =
harm. Further, when you do a Chandi homa, no ethereal beings will disturb y=
ou because no one wants to mess with=A0someone who is worshipping Chandi. I=
t is not difficult, neither something to be unnecessarily scared of. There =
are spirits etc for sure, but neither will you bother them nor will they bo=
ther you. =A0Surrendering to the deity is very good=A0attitude to have. And=
 finally, the soul of the individual on whose pyre the homa is being done, =
is taken by the Goddess and acquires a lot of punya.
=A0
Thus ended my firs=
t experience of a Chandi homa on a burning pyre.That night was Krishna Sapt=
ami. The next two nights again we did homas at Manikarnik. 
=A0
-Regards
