Dear Devotees,

=C2=A0Firstof all my humble apologies to God.=C2=A0What I s=
aid was just a opinion not a judgement or conclusion I still take my words =
back for even passing an opinion on a highly spiritual=C2=A0person=C2=A0for=
 which I am least qualified.=C2=A0Sorry to the members also.

Om Shantih, S=

Utpal ji and Rajarshi ji

Vimala=
nanda says in book1 Page 97 Chapter: Shiva

"This is one of the many reason=
s I hate communism .Communists are taught to forget their parents ,culture =
to denounce them .If you destroy your parents and culture which is your roo=
t how do you ever expect to prosper "

1.I agree on Tehelka and Sun tv.Both=
 are politically affliated entities with parties hell bent on atheism which=
 wait for a chance to use any occassion to denigrate sanatana dharma. I do =
not wish to deviate the discussion but interesting piece of tidbit.Sun tv w=
hich brought out the clip is owned by dayanidhi maran brother of Karunanidh=
i ( Supremo DMK which is a carbon copy of Communist ideology) and in today'=
s speech he used the cover of this occasion to once again lash out at dharm=
a.

The same Karunanidhi also lashed out at Kanchi Peethadhipathi when the =
fiasco was ongoing. Hindu newspaper which is praised by normal people as un=
biased was writing articles every day with so called details of misgivings =
at the ashram....Sense a pattern ...That is the media war of modern India c=
ontrolled by vested interests who would love to see an hindu sanyasi get in=
sulted.Also stakeholders in this drama are the missionary orgs.

2.In Nithy=
ananda' s defense he never said he was god . He also never encouraged one t=
o turn away from sex. His advice was very simple ...when in the physical ac=
t keep it physical.As long as fantasies are not involved it does not become=
 a addiction. 

He could very well be repaying a rna ...or might be involve=
d in a sexual ritual. 

Two of his gurus were an old woman and a female tan=
trik which he mentions in his youtube video on divine consciousness and fem=
inity.

3.Like Narasimha ji pointed out , he has a very good way of explain=
ing higher level truths.

What he did or did not do is only his karma alone=
 .This does not take away anything from his lectures or messages.

and like=
 Utpal ji rightly pointed out...When we are prepared to sit on a high moral=
 horse to judge others...we better be prepared when the divine mother tests=
 us.By juding we will incurr a share of the karma others committed and also=
 will be judged quite harshly when our turn comes.

 And finally, it is q\uite possible that Swami Nityananda *maybe* a fake gu=
ru. We do not know. But in the times to come, the idea of running after a g=
uru will change. Each one must take God as his/her guru and keep doing sadh=
ana and Nature will teach in the best possible way. In this regard, fire ca=
n act as an excellent guru if one keeps doing homas for some years.
