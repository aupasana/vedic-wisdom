Pranaams Narasimha,

>From Aghora II: Kundalini, I reproduce what Vimalananda says "....There are
four important nights: Maha (Shiva) Ratri or Krishna Chaturdasi during lunar
month of Magha, Krura Ratri (Holi) or Pournami after Maha ratri, Moha Ratri
or Astami in lunar month of Shravana, and Kala ratri or Krishna Chaturdasi
in lunar month of Ashwin..."

Most calendars in North India have put Holi as March 1 but in light of what
you/Sivachariar are saying about MahaShivaRatri, Holi should be celebrated
on March 29 instead?

best regards
Hari
