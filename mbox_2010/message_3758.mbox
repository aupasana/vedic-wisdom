Namaste Nagraj,

All the best on your spiritual endevaours as you embark on=
 learning the Saptashati and eventually performing homam with it. One thing=
 that I thought might be of great use in your journey is a powerful narrati=
ve from Narasimha on the deeper meaning of the Chandi Saptashati in his ina=
ugural post to this group. I reproduce it here so that it may help you and =
the legions of devotees who are performing
or getting ready to perform Chan=
di Homam.

On the surface it seems like a simple story of Mother Goddesses'=
 valour and battlefield exploits over fierce and seemingly unvanquishable d=
emons. When I first read the Chandi (and I'm not ready yet to perform the h=
omam) I was stricken by self-doubt by what seemed a simplistic narrative - =
demons arise and Mother kills them, some more demons arise and Mother conqu=
ers them and so on it went...but Narasimhaji's powerful synthesis of the de=
eper meaning and some other material that I read on Shreema's website dispe=
lled all doubts as to what this extremely potent and powerful text is all a=
bout. I faithfully reproduce it below (later on I will reproduce some of th=
e comments of Satyananda Saraswati from Shreema's ashram on the great Sapta=
shati).

Herewith:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - =
- - - - - -

Some people mistakenly think that Chandi Saptashati is merely =
an account of the exploits of Durgaa and her slaying of demons Mahisha, Cha=
nda, Munda, Raktabeeja, Shumbha, Nishumbha etc. They view it as a collectio=
n of stories. But, IMHO, that is a very limited view. Devi mahatmyam is muc=
h more than a collection of stories. After all, Vedas are its swaroopam! Ri=
gveda, Yajurveda and Saamaveda are the swaroopam (form/essence/a different =
manifestation) of the three parts of Chandi Saptashati. The purpose of Veda=
s is self-knowledge. How can something with Vedas as its swaroopam be about=
 something other than self-knowledge? 
 
*        *        *
 
Though Devi =
Mahatmyam looks like stories, there are very valuable lessons on Her nature=
 in it. The deeper you go, the more you can understand and appreciate the l=
essons in the stories. Let me give a couple of examples.
 
(1) When various=
 Mothers are going to war with demons, this is how it is described (8-14): =
"Whatever form, decoration, weapons and vehicle each god has, his shakti (e=
nergy) came in the same form, decoration, weapons and vehicle." The next 9 =
verses describe how Brahmaani etc came. For example, Brahmaani came on a sw=
an with aksha sutra and kamandalu (worn by Brahma), Maaheswari came on a gr=
eat bull with a Trishoola and She wore a big snake and Moon. And so on.
 
W=
hat is the message hidden in the above description? The normal imagery pain=
ted elsewhere is of female deities with a separate form. Here, they are dep=
icted differently.
 
The fact that these female deities are identical to th=
e male counterparts in form, decoration, weapons and vehicles suggests, to =
me, that they are not really separate from the male counterparts. Brahma an=
d Brahmaani are not separate. Maheswara and Maaheswari are not separate. Vi=
shnu and Vaishnavi are not separate. And so on. Brahmaani is simply the sha=
kti (vitality/energy) of Brahma. Maaheswari is simply the shakti (vitality/=
energy) of Maheswara. And so on.
 
If Vaishnavi went on Garuda vehicle and =
killed a demon, it actually means that Vishnu went on a Garuda vehicle and =
killed the demon. Vaishanvi is the personification of Vishnu's energy, whic=
h makes Vishnu be, think, desire, move and act. Vaishnavi is not separate f=
rom Vishnu.
 
Of course, if you imagine Vaishnavi (Lakshmi) as a separate p=
erson with certain attributes, She may manifest limited by your imagination=
 and even give you a darshan in that form. However, that is a limited form =
and Her true nature is beyond that. Her true and highest nature is that She=
 is an inseparable part of Vishnu and represents the energy of Vishnu. She =
is the part of Vishnu that makes Vishnu think, desire, act etc. Vaishnavi i=
s basically Chetana (animated consciousness) of Vishnu.
 
Thus, contemplati=
on on these verses will make you understand the true nature of male devatas=
 and female devatas and their relationship better. It will enable you to ap=
preciate the highest nature of Shakti.
 
Puranas personify everything to ma=
ke things interesting and understandable by laymen. However, it is more fun=
 to explore the deeper meanings.
 
(2) Take Raktabeeja's slaying. Raktabeej=
a is a demon with a special ability. If a drop of blood falls from his body=
 on the ground, another demon will be born from it and will be of the same =
size, age and strength as the original Raktabeeja even at birth. As Vaishna=
vi, Maaheswari, Aindri etc were hurting Raktabeeja in the fight, more and m=
ore demons were being born and all the gods were scared. Then Chandikaa tol=
d Kaali to expand her face and eat all the demons as they are born. Chandik=
a goes around the war ground eating all the demons as they are born and eve=
ntually Raktabeeja runs out of blood.
 
This looks like a nice story. But, =
is there is a deeper meaning in it that helps you in self-realization? Why =
was Kaali the chosen one and not Vaishnavi or Naarasimhi or Aindri?
 
The w=
ord rakta means blood. Another meaning is "desire/passion". The word comes =
from the root ranj/rang, which means "to color". Desire/passion/attachment =
colors and conditions the mind. Beeja means seed.
 
Raktabeeja means "the s=
eed of desire". Raktabeeja fighting with gods symbolizes desires taking the=
 better of our good judgment and good qualities. Each human being is a micr=
ocosm of the macrocosm that the universe is. All devatas reside in us as va=
rious good qualities and all demons reside in us as various undesirable qua=
lities. When we are overcome by desires and do bad deeds, the Raktabeeja wi=
thin us is defeating the gods within us.
 
The thing is that desires are di=
fficult to get rid of. You get rid of one desire and another desire is born=
. That is what Raktabeeja's special ability means. The "seed of desires" (i=
.e. basic attachment that is the nature of mind) within us will keep produc=
ing more and more desires. It is very resourceful.
 
Then, why Kaali to des=
troy Him?
 
In astrology, we associate Mahaakaala and Mahaakaali with Satur=
n. Kaali shows detachment and vairaagyam. She wears a garland of skulls, sy=
mbolizing that there is an endless cycle (garland) of births a material for=
m (skull) goes thru. The way Kaali shows to overcome the cycle is vairaagya=
m and detachment. She shows meaningful and highest level of vairaagyam that=
 comes with a deep understanding of the cycle of material forms.
 
To fully=
 cut off the "seed of desires" so that one does not get any more desires, o=
ne needs to develop vairaagyam and detachment and keep on destroying desire=
s as they are born and persist like that. After persisting for a long time,=
 the "seed of desires" will run out of desires and the basic attachment of =
mind will vanish.
 
Thus, simple stories have deep meanings. This particula=
r story celebrates the value of detachment, vairaagyam and persistence - Sa=
turnine qualities.
 
*        *        *
 
Merely chanting Chandi saptashat=
i without understanding the meaning is also excellent and produces results.=
 Understanding the meaning and marvelling at the power of the Mother makes =
one fearless and energetic and also give material benefits. Understanding t=
he deeper meanings and appreciating the True Nature of the Mother makes one=
 realize one's own true nature. It has various benefits at various levels o=
f sadhana. It is tough to exactly say what benefit it gives, as that depend=
s on the evolution level of sadhaka and his attitude. But, there is somethi=
ng in Chandipath for everyone!
 
However, the highest purpose is self-knowl=
edge and that is why Vedas are its swaroopam.
 
*        *        *
 
Towar=
ds the end, the 11th chapter (titled "Naaraayani Stuti") describes gods pra=
ying to the Divine Mother after slaying all the demons. They address Her as=
 "Naaraayani". Trimurthis symbolize the purest aspects of the three gunas. =
Vishnu is one of them. He is of Sattva guna and sustains the creation. Howe=
ver, Narayana is different. He is not Vishnu (contrast Narayana sooktam wit=
h Vishnu sooktam!). He is gunaateeta (above gunas/attributes). He is the Sa=
hasraseersha and Parama Purusha (Supreme Cosmic Being). Some people may val=
idly describe the same as Samba Sada Shiva also, but let us not argue about=
 names. When we are essentially speaking about an entity that is beyond att=
ributes, it is foolish to argue about the name. After all, name too is an a=
ttribute that intends to describe other attributes! Though great people gav=
e different names to Parama Purusha, the names essentially capture the natu=
re of the *path* those people took to experience the Parama Purusha rather =
than the nature of Parama Purusha, which is beyond names and attributes.
 
=
The bottomline is that there is a Parama Purusha above the Trimurthis (Brah=
ma, Vishnu and Shiva). IF we call him Narayana, then Narayani is His energy=
 and She is the root cause of all manifested creation.
 
Saptashati is abou=
t Narayani. It is about the inseparable root energy of the Supreme Cosmic B=
eing who is the source of this entire universe. A small part of that root e=
nergy lies within us too. Because I said "small part", don't think it is sm=
all. Even a small percentage of infinity is still infinity. Though each of =
us is a microcosm of the macrocosm that the entire universe is, each of us =
is a complete and accurate replica of the entire universe. Think "poornamad=
ah poornamidam" in Vedic spirit! The purpose of all spiritual sadhana is re=
alizing the true nature of self. Chandipath can also be viewed from that pe=
rspective.
 
-----------------------------------------------------
 

Someo=
ne queried a while back on the meaning behind the story of Madhu Kaitabha. =
Here is a quick reply based on my limited understanding.
 
*        *      =
  *
 
Madhu means honey. "Madhu keeta" means an insect of honey, i.e. honey=
 bee. Madhu kaita means belonging to honey bees. It can be the qualities or=
 nature of honey bees. One of the meanings of "bha" is "having a similarity=
 to". Thus, in my judgment, "Madhu Kaitabha" means "having a semblance to t=
he nature of honey bees".
 
*        *        *
 
Like I keep saying, Sansk=
rit is a fantastic language. Sanskrit names selected by Rishis for expressi=
ng various concepts and stories are very thoughtful. Depending on how deep =
one goes, there are many meanings of the same word. Thus, Rishis expressed =
concepts that may have one meaning to a layman and a different meaning to o=
ne who is ready to understand the deeper meaning! I salute to the wisdom of=
 our Rishis!
 
I was saying the same thing at Arsha Vidya Gurukulam last we=
ekend. When somebody said at an open discussion that the idea is important =
and not the name, as there are many names of the same thing in many languag=
es, I made a quick point about the value of Sanskrit names. I said that San=
skrit names have not one meaning, but layers of meanings that can be unders=
tood based on the capability of the reader. Rishis used this to hide some s=
pecial meanings and to keep some higher knowledge as secret, even though it=
 is very much out there! The example I gave was of bhava and pada. Parasara=
 described bhavas (houses) and how to find their respective padas (arudha p=
adas of houses) and said that a bhava and its pada should be judged to see =
the matters of a house. Though he did not explain the difference between a =
bhava and its pada further and did not elucidate when to use which one, I s=
aid that the very choice of names is a huge clue! Bhava, which is usually t=
ranslated as a house, also means "a thought/concept/feeling" and pada means=
 "a symbol/word" used to express a thought/concept. Thus, houses are to the=
ir arudha padas what thoughts (bhavas) are to the words (padas) that attemp=
t to express them. For example, if the 4th house shows one's happiness from=
 vehicles, the pada of 4th house shows the tangible articles that attempt t=
o throw light on one's happiness from vehicles (e.g. the physical vehicle o=
wned by one). Houses (bhavas) show intangible/internal aspects of a matter =
(just like thoughts inside one's head), while their arudha padas show tangi=
ble/external aspects of a matter (just like the external words spoken that =
attempt to express the thoughts in the head). If you use the English words =
to translate Parasara, this hidden meaning may be lost! So, I argued that S=
anskrit names used by Rishis are not like words in any language.
 
*       =
 *        *
 
Anyway, let us come back to the Madhu Kaitabha story. As I sa=
id, Madhu Kaitabha means "having a semblance to the quality of honeybees". =
What is the quality of honey bees? Well, they keep working hard to accumula=
te the sweet honey! They are not intelligent enough to think about any high=
er things in life. Thus, Madhu Kaitabha are an allegory to the quality with=
in us which makes us work hard, like honeybees, with a single-minded focus =
on accumulating material comforts. Like honeybees accumulate honey, we accu=
mulate material objects and spend whole life working hard doing just that.
=
 
Vishnu is a personification of the sattwa guna of the Parama Purusha (Uni=
versal/Absolute Being). Within us, Vishnu is an allegory to the sattwa guna=
 within us. Madhu Kaitabha were born from Vishnu's earwax when He was alsee=
p. The ability to work hard like a bee is not really a terrible thing. This=
 ability is essentially born from the sattwa guna within us, when it is in =
deep slumber (i.e. sattwa guna covered by taamasi shakti, i.e. sattwa guna =
that "manifests" in a taamasik way).
 
There are so many good people in thi=
s world, who just spend their entire lives in honest labor like the honeybe=
es and accumulate things for themselves and others around them. Their sattw=
a is in deep sleep and Madhu Kaitabha born from that asleep sattva are very=
 much active.
 
The problem with this focus on hard work and accumulation o=
f material objects is that it keeps us away from supreme bliss. Madhu Kaita=
bha's attack on Brahma and Vedas is symbolic of that. Vedas symbolize the s=
upreme and liberating knowledge of self and Brahma, the carrier of Vedas, s=
ymbolizes the sadhana to achieve the supreme knowledge. The focus on workin=
g like honeybees and accumulating material objects tries to kills one's abi=
lity to do sadhana and obtain supreme knowledge of self.
 
Vishnu battles M=
adhu Kaitabha for 5,000 years. Devi Bhagavatam even describes that Vishnu w=
ondered in the middle how to defeat Madhu Kaitabha, as He finds them quite =
formidable! Even when the sattva in us awakens, it is difficult for it to o=
vercome the formidable instinct to lead the life of a honeybee and to accum=
ulate the material objects for oneself and others.
 
According to Parasara,=
 thighs are seen from the 9th house of dharma. The earthy element symbolize=
s the commitment and stability. The fact that earthy element came from the =
thighs of Vishnu shows that it is the dharma of sattwa guna sustaining this=
 universe that ensures that there is commitment and stability in this creat=
ion.
 
Moreover, it is apt that someone born in the ears (3rd house) of Vis=
hnu found end in the thighs (9th house, i.e. 7th house of death from the 3r=
d house) of Vishnu! Similarly, Brahma, who is born from the navel (6th hous=
e) of Vishnu should naturally find His end in the 12th house of Vishnu (fee=
t/sleep), which is the 7th house of death from the 6th house! That may be w=
hy Vishnu goes to sleep, when there is a change of Brahma.
 
Anyway, the in=
stinct within us to keep accumulating material objects like honey bees accu=
mulate honey finds its end in the dharma of the sattwa guna, i.e. when the =
sattwa guna within us follows its dharma. Then we are fully awake spiritual=
ly. Naturally, the path to self-knowledge becomes open then and Brahma beco=
mes elated.
 
Thus, the story of Madhu-Kaitabha refers, allegorically, to t=
he instinct most of us have towards leading a "regular" life, working hard =
like honeybees and accumulating objects for self and others and how that in=
stinct needs to be defeated by waking up the sattwa guna and allowing it to=
 perform its dharma.
 
*        *        *
 
Lest I am misunderstood, I nee=
d to clarify one thing. I am not saying that these stories are not real. Th=
ese stories ARE very much real. In fact, when a Yogi is able to transport c=
onsciousness (Kundalini) to a particular plane (chakra), He/She can vividly=
 see these stories actually happening. The stories are as real as our own e=
xistence as beings made of flesh and blood is, in the normal plane of consc=
iousness.
 
What I am saying is that there is an allegorical link between v=
arious planes of consciousness. What is real in one plane of consciousness =
is an allegory in another plane of consciousness. If one is atleast capable=
 of understanding a story as an allegory, that will serve a valuable purpos=
e!
