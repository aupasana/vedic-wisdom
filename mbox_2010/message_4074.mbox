 Srimati Kanakamma doesn't need much coaxing to speak about the wonder of
S=
ri Bhagavan and the blessings he showered on her. In the following
videotap=
ed interview, taken in Madras by Graham Boyd in March, 1999, she
pours out =
her experiences and insights. These are only excerpts translated
from Tamil=
 by V. Swaminathan of New York.

How to speak?

The next day I wanted to go=
 for a pradakshina around Arunachala. As I could
not go alone, Anandammal w=
ould accompany me. When I went to take Bhagavan's
permission at about 5 a.m=
., no one else was present. I thought that this
would be my best opportunit=
y to speak to Bhagavan. As I prostrate before
him, I thought, "What do I as=
k him?" On such occasions, I would think, "What
do you know? What will you =
ask this divine being at whose very sight you
become tongue-tied?" All my q=
uestions would then remained bottled-up inside
me. On that day, somehow mus=
tering courage, I managed to speak out,
"Bhagavan! I am going for pradakshi=
na." I did not know what else to say.
Bhagavan, who was reclining on the so=
fa came forward towards me and said,
"Uh! What?" I then realized that altho=
ugh I requested permission to go for
pradakshina, no sound came from my mou=
th. Only my lips moved. Again, I tried
telling Bhagavan, with the same resu=
lt. Bhagavan then said, "Oho! So you are
going for the pradakshina? Who is =
accompanying you?" Anandammal, who had
come to the hall by then and was sta=
nding beside me said, "Bhagavan, I am
going." Bhagavan said "Very Good! Ver=
y Good" and gave a beatific smile. Thus,
despite several opportunities to d=
o so, I was never able to speak to
Bhagavan. So how could I ask him anythin=
g? And what was I to ask? Some
people told me to ask him whatever doubts ca=
me to me in my sadhana. But then
it would occur to me that If we did sadhan=
a the way Bhagavan asked us to,
then there is absolutely no room for doubt.=
 Such doubts are only on account
of our own mistakes in not following Bhaga=
van. Thus, I never asked Bhagavan
any questions.

Look of Grace

This incid=
ent took place when Bhagavan had moved into the new hall. During
those days=
, the front row closest to Bhagavan was reserved for important
people, alth=
ough Bhagavan did not know about it. There was a specific
unspoken seating =
arrangement and others who occupied those places would even
be asked to go =
and sit elsewhere. On this day, Rani Mazumdar and myself were
sitting by th=
e window at the end of the hall when we noticed that the front
row was empt=
y. Rani suggested that the two of us could sit there close to
Bhagavan. I a=
greed. The front row would begin at the pillars closest to
Bhagavan's couch=
. No one could sit right beside the couch in order to give
people room to m=
ove about. On seeing the two of us, a telugu lady called
Kameswaramma also =
came and sat next to us in the front row. The three of us
were directly fac=
ing Bhagavan.

As soon as we had settled there, Bhagavan began looking dire=
ctly at me.
Unable to bear the intensity of his direct look, I immediately =
closed my
eyes. How long I remained like that I do not know, but sometime l=
ater, I
opened my eyes and found Bhagavan seated motionless looking at me j=
ust as
before. Again I closed my eyes. Sometime later, Mauni Srinivasa Rao =
came
with the day's mail. Hearing Bhagavan talk to him, I opened my eyes.
H=
owever, I was still in the same state that I was in when my eyes were
close=
d and whatever was happening didn't really register in my mind. After
atten=
ding to the correspondence, Bhagavan got up to leave for the cow shed.
I go=
t up along with everybody else but again without any real awareness of
my s=
urroundings.

Kameswaramma, who was sitting next to me, hugged me and said,=
 "Kanakamma,
you are extremely fortunate. Ever since you sat there, Bhagava=
n has been
steadily looking directly at you up until the Mauni came with th=
e mail. You
have got everything. Bhagavan has given you all that you need."=
 So saying,
she hugged me close to her. But I was in no state to give a rep=
ly. I just
told her, "Tears are streaming down my eyes. I don't know what t=
o say." The
waves of peace coming over me kept me from talking.

As the min=
d tends to go out, turn it inwards then and there. It goes out
owing to the=
 habit of looking for happiness outside oneself; but the
knowledge that the=
 external objects are not the cause of happiness will keep
it in check. Thi=
s is vairagya or dispassion. Only after perfect vairagya the
mind becomes s=
teady.
