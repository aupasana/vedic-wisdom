Namaste

1) In the 8th chapter of the Chandi Path, the Shivduti form of the=
 Devi
is explained.   At a very simple level pure sattwa form of manifested=

consciousness (Devi) asks the unmanifest / absolute consciousness
(Shiva) =
to go to self identification represented by ego and attachment
(Shumbha and=
 Nishumbha) as an envoy with a proposal for them to withdraw
to avoid confl=
ict or if they insist then come to battle and face defeat.
What is the esot=
eric significant of this form of the Devi and why is she
doing so?

2) In t=
he 7th chapter both Devi and Kali are mentioned in fighting
Chanda and Mund=
a and while the duo are slain by the Devi (Ambika), their
heads are picked =
up by Kali and brought over to Devi and henceforth Kali
is said to be calle=
d by the name of Chamunda.  Is a distinction to be
made between Devi and Ka=
li here?  If so, then why is Kali named as
Chamunda when she picks up the s=
lain heads of Chanda and Munda only
whereas they are actually slain by the =
Devi.
