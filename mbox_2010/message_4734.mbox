 Question : What is samadhi?

Ramana Maharshi : The state in which the unbr=
oken experience of
existence-consciousness is attained by the still mind, a=
lone is samadhi. That
still mind which is adorned with the attainment of th=
e limitless supreme
Self, alone is the reality of God.

When the mind is in=
 communion with the Self in darkness, it is called nidra
[sleep], that is, =
the immersion of the mind in ignorance.Immersion in a
conscious or wakeful =
state is called samadhi. Samadhi is continuous
inherence in the Self in a w=
aking state. Nidra or sleep is also inherence in
the Self but in an unconsc=
ious state. In sahaja samadhi the communion is
con-tinuous.

Question : Wha=
t are kevala nirvikalpa samadhi and sahaja nirvikalpa samadhi?

Ramana Maha=
rshi :The immersion of the mind in the Self, but without its
destruction, i=
s kevala nirvikalpa samadhi. In this state one is not free
from vasanas and=
 so one does not therefore attain mukti. Only after the
vasanas have been d=
estroyed can one attain liberation.

Question : When can one practise sahaj=
a samadhi?

Ramana Maharshi : Even from the beginning. Even though one prac=
tises kevala
nirvikalpa samadhi for years together, if one has not rooted o=
ut the vasanas
one will not attain liberation.

Question : May I have a cle=
ar idea of the difference between savikalpa and
nirvikalpa?

Ramana Maharsh=
i : Holding on to the supreme state is samadhi. When it is
with effort due =
to mental disturbances, it is savikalpa. When these
disturbances are absent=
, it is nirvikalpa. Remaining permanently in the
primal state without effor=
t is sahaja.

Question : Is nirvikalpa samadhi absolutely necessary before =
the attainment
of sahaja?

Ramana Maharshi : Abiding permanently in any of =
these samadhis, either
savikalpa or nirvikalpa, is sahaja [the natural stat=
e]. What is
body-consciousness? It is the insentient body plus consciousnes=
s. Both of
these must lie in another consciousness which is absolute and un=
affected and
which remains as it always is, with or without the body-consci=
ousness. What
does it then matter whether the body-consciousness is lost or=
 retained,
provided one is holding on to that pure consciousness? Total abs=
ence of
body-consciousness has the advantage of making the samadhi more int=
ense,
although it makes no difference to the knowledge of the supreme.

Que=
stion : Can the meditator be affected by physical disturbances during
nirvi=
kalpa samadhi? My friend and I disagree on this point.


Ramana Maharshi : =
Both of you are right. One of you is referring to kevala
and the other to s=
ahaja samadhi. In both cases the mind is immersed in the
bliss of the Self.=
 In the former, physical movements may cause disturbance
to the meditator, =
because the mind has not completely died out. It is still
alive and can, as=
 after deep sleep, at any moment be active again.

It is compared to a buck=
et, which, although completely submerged under
water, can be pulled out by =
a rope which is still attached to it. In sahaja,
the mind has sunk complete=
ly into the Self, like the bucket which has got
drowned in the depths of th=
e well along with its rope. In sahaja there is
nothing left to be disturbed=
 or pulled back to the world. One's activities
then resemble that of the ch=
ild who sucks its mother's milk in sleep, and is
hardly aware of the feedin=
g.

Question : How can one function in the world in such a state?

Ramana M=
aharshi : One who accustoms himself naturally to meditation and
enjoys the =
bliss of meditation will not lose his samadhi state whatever
external work =
he does, whatever thoughts may come to him. That is sahaja
nirvikalpa. Saha=
ja nirvikalpa is nasa [total destruction of the mind]
whereas kevala nirvik=
alpa is laya [temporary abeyance of the mind].

Those who are in the laya s=
amadhi state will have to bring the mind back
under control from time to ti=
me. If the mind is destroyed, as it is in
sahaja samadhi, it will never spr=
out again. Whatever is done by such people
is just incidental, they will ne=
ver slide down from their high state.

Those that are in the kevala nirvika=
lpa state are not realized, they are
still seekers. Those who are in the sa=
haja nirvikalpa state are like a light
in a windless place, or the ocean wi=
thout waves; that is, there is no
movement in them. They cannot find anythi=
ng which is different from
themselves. For those who do not reach that stat=
e, everything appears to be
different from themselves.

Question : Is the e=
xperience of kevala nirvikalpa the same as that of
sahaja, although one com=
es down from it to the relative world?

Ramana Maharshi : There is neither =
coming down nor going up - he who goes up
and down is not real.In kevala ni=
rvikalpa there is the mental bucket still
in existence under the water, and=
 it can be pulled out at any moment. Sahaja
is like the river that has link=
ed up with the ocean from which there is no
return. Why do you ask all thes=
e questions? Go on practising till you have
the experience yourself.

Quest=
ion : What is the use of samadhi and does thought subsist then?

Ramana Mah=
arshi : Samadhi alone can reveal the truth. Thoughts cast a veil
over reali=
ty, and so it is not realized as such in states other than
samadhi. In sama=
dhi there is only the feeling `I am' and no thoughts. The
experience of `I =
am' is `being still'.

Question : How can I repeat the experience of samadh=
i or the stillness that
I obtain here in your presence?

Ramana Maharshi : =
Your present experience is due to the influence of the
atmosphere in which =
you find yourself. Can you have it outside this
atmosphere? The experience =
is spasmodic(Occurring in spells and often
abruptly). Until it becomes perm=
anent, practice is necessary.
