Namaste,
 
Thanks for your views. There are many standard homam procedures =
in the world today, some more elaborate than what we teach and some more br=
ief. I do not care exactly what procedure one uses and I will be happy if m=
ore and more people do homam *regularly*, irrespective of the exact procedu=
re used! What I teach is ONE procedure for those who do not know any. If yo=
u are initiated into a different procedure that you can do daily, please go=
 ahead and do it daily the way you know it. That will make us very happy. H=
owever, if the method you know cannot be done daily, please consider what I=
 taught, which is simple enough to do daily.
 
*        *        *
 
Suppos=
e there are rules and protocols on how one should serve lunch to one's pare=
nts, e.g. how to place the plates, spoons, forks, soup bowls, drink cups, d=
essert bowls etc and how and in what order to serve various items in those =
containers. Suppose the protocol is so complex that one cannot do it everyd=
ay and calls one's parents for a lunch once every few months.
 
Is that bet=
ter or is it better to relax the rules and protocols to make it less formal=
 and serve lunch to parents everyday?

The only knowledge that should (and can) be preserved witho=
ut corruption is knowledge that is *absolute*. Veda, or the knowledge of im=
perishable Self, alone is absolute knowledge.
 
Knowledge of *external ritu=
als* is relative and can never be absolute. It evolves based on desa-kaala-=
paatra. There is nothing impure or corrupt about it.
 
At the end of the da=
y, the key is whether one is actually doing some sadhana on a regular basis=
 or not, whether it is causing internal transformation in one or not, and w=
hether it helps in one's spiritual progress or not.

Let me cut & paste a section from a writeup I wrote for an upcoming occasi=
on. It contains an analogy given earlier and addresses some relevant issues=
.
 
-----------------------------
Do Vedas Describe External Rituals
 
Some=
 people believe that Veda describes the specifics about various external ya=
gyas. Veda is supposed to be absolute, timeless and uncreated knowledge tha=
t is not bound by desa-kaala-paatra. How can descriptions of specific exter=
nal rituals be unbound by desa-kaala-paatra?
 
Though Sayanacharya=E2=80=99=
s celebrated commentary on RigVeda is ritualistic in nature, Aurobindo Ghos=
e had a different take in his =E2=80=9CSecret of the Veda=E2=80=9D. His vie=
w is that Veda talks about absolute truths about the inner self and not rel=
ative truths about external matters. Agni or Fire symbolizes the divine Wil=
l. That is why it is the immortal in mortals. Its rhythm will devour everyt=
hing that is perishable and purify all. While fire in a fire ritual symboli=
zes the divine Will, various offerings in it symbolize various aspects of o=
ne=E2=80=99s conditioning and the smoke symbolizes one=E2=80=99s passions a=
nd desires.
 
Metaphor: Vedic Homam vs Aagamic Homam
 
Notions that so and =
so yagya ritual is sanctioned by Veda and so and so aagamic/tantric yagya r=
itual is not sanctioned by Veda can be put in perspective using a metaphor.=

 
Once there were many people who lived near the sea [Aatman]. They regula=
rly sat by the sea and enjoyed the sight and sound of the sea [absorbed in =
Aatman most of the time]. They described the sea in some nice cryptic poems=
 [Veda].
 
As people started living a little away from the sea [less spirit=
ually evolved], someone had to put together some instructions on how to rea=
ch the sea. He said, "keep walking towards east" and the instructions grew =
with time. People faithfully followed the instructions [rituals].
 
People =
started moving further and further inland and started living in a landlocke=
d desert far away from the sea. This generation had never seen a pool of wa=
ter like a lake, let alone a sea. They faithfully performed the ritual of w=
alking towards east, but did not find sea. They debated endlessly whether o=
ne had to walk one mile or two miles or three miles and formed different sc=
hools of thought. Some walked their chosen distance, found a tree or a buil=
ding or some interesting object and even became satisfied that that was sea=
!
 
Then came some great person, whose instincts led him to take a horse in=
stead of walking and ride it for a long distance [use of other tools]. He d=
id find the sea after a few months. He put together newer instructions to r=
each the sea, which included riding a horse [new =C3=A4gama and tantra].
 
=
People performing the old rituals objected to this and said "but then this =
horse thing is not granted by the book of sea. This is a new path and diffe=
rent from the "pure" sea ritual" [pure Vedic ritual]. By now, people did no=
t even understand what the cryptic poems of the original "book of sea" mean=
, but they simply believed that those poems taught the old "pure" sea ritua=
ls that they were used to. They were blissfully unaware that the original i=
nstructions were meant for someone already close to sea and the newer instr=
uctions came from someone who actually saw the sea and knew where they curr=
ently lived and how to get to the sea from there!
 
Slowly many new sets of=
 instructions involving horses, chariots etc were taught and many new paths=
 to the sea were outlined instead of just instructing people to walk toward=
s east [evolution of mantra/tantra/yantras].
 
One particular path through =
jungles was dangerous [aghora and other dark tantric paths involving practi=
ce of sex, meat, wine etc]. Though the distance to sea was much shorter thr=
ough that jungle, it was just too dangerous and only the bravest and strong=
est could make it. There were cruel dacoits and wild animals [chance of a f=
all in a risky ritual] and many weak people travelling to sea via that path=
 were killed. A wise man who knew the entire territory well came forward, c=
ondemned that path and discouraged people from trying that path. Since then=
, even people who were strong enough to successfully make it in that path d=
esisted from it.
 
As time progressed, people started fighting too much abo=
ut whose path was superior. They were foolish, not smart enough to adopt th=
e original instructions, of either the so-called "pure" sea path or the so-=
called "new" path or other variations, for the changed geography and change=
d times. Many followed the instructions blindly, hit roadblocks and did not=
 reach sea. Many did not even know that "reaching the sea" was the actual g=
oal of all their joirneys. They only thought they were supposed to follow t=
he instructions faithfully and there was no need to adopt to the changed ge=
ographical territory and time. They even condemned those who actually went =
to sea, came back and gave updated directions for their place and time, for=
 violating tradition.
 
In case the analogy is not clear, here is a brief s=
ummary of its points. Veda is about realizing self. Vedic deities such as A=
gni, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Aswins, Brihaspati etc are slightly different as=
pects of Aatman. Veda describes various aspects of the state of self-realiz=
ation. That is why it is considered the highest knowledge. Other allied sub=
jects throw some light on possible ways to reach that state. While definiti=
ve and absolute statements can be made on the actual state of self-realizat=
ion itself, no definitive statements can be made on how to reach it. Only r=
elative statements can be made based on desa-kaala-paatra. The path depends=
 on one's current position!
 
Great men in many spiritual paths, within Hin=
duism as well as outside of it, came, experienced that state, understood th=
e current state of people around them and gave specific instructions on how=
 to reach that state from the current state. Some followed the instructions=
 and experienced the state. Some instead kept arguing about the contradicti=
ons between paths.
 
Stop Arguing and Do Sadhana
 
As the metaphor above il=
lustrates, arguments about various paths are irrelevant and distracting. Wh=
at is important is to pick a path and follow it. Whether one does a Vedic h=
omam or an Aagamic homam is a secondary issue. The primary issues are wheth=
er one does homam or not, how focused one is, how one=E2=80=99s focus is im=
proving and how one is being transformed internally.
 
Just as a twenty cou=
rse meal eaten once every six months does not give much energy to one, a =
=E2=80=9Cbig=E2=80=9D homam or another ritual done once every six months or=
 a year does not boost one=E2=80=99s spiritual or material pursuits. Just a=
s a small bowl of rice and lentil soup eaten everyday gives more energy to =
one, a small 20-30 minute homam done everyday gives a boost to one=E2=80=99=
s spiritual evolution.
 
Wise Tradeoffs
 
Suppose the president of the coun=
try is visiting one for lunch with 100 associates. One can invite all the 1=
00 associates of the President by name and seat them in the room individual=
ly, following various protocols. Then one can exchange long pleasantries wi=
th the President and then offer lunch.
 
Suppose one is in a hurry and has =
very little time. If one still invites all the 100 associates by name and s=
eats them in the room individually following the protocol and does not have=
 enough time to let the President eat lunch in the end, is it a wise tradeo=
ff? Or is it wiser to invite all the 100 associates together and seat them =
together by violating the protocol and use that time to let the President e=
at in peace?
 
Similarly, is it wise if one exchanges long pleasantries and=
 gives very little time to eat? Or should one cut short on the pleasantries=
 and give more time to eat?
 
In a fire ritual, making offerings to the mai=
n deity is the primary part. Various upacharas done to the deity before the=
 offerings commence is secondary. Various preliminary and final steps and o=
fferings to associate deities are tertiary. If one has a few hours for the =
fire ritual, one can do everything given in scriptures leisurely. If one ha=
s only 20-30 minutes, one needs to make wise tradeoffs and maximize the ben=
efit. It is far better than doing nothing.
 
<sections deleted>
 
Proof of =
the Pudding
 
At this time, more than hundred people are doing a homam to s=
ome deity or the other, everyday. Spending time worshipping god in fire for=
 20-30 min (or more) everyday, with an attitude of surrender and with some =
basic intellectual understanding of the absolute truths expounded by Veda a=
nd Upanishads, can do a world of good to one=E2=80=99s spiritual evolution.=
 The proof of the pudding is in eating it. One can try to perform a short h=
omam everyday for a few months and see for oneself if there is a difference=
 in one=E2=80=99s attitude, focus and clarity of thinking.
