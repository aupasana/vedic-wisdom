 O Rama, he sees the truth who sees the body as a product of deluded
unders=
tanding and as the fountain-source of misfortune, andwho knows that
the bod=
y is not the Self.

He sees the truth who sees that this body pleasure and =
pain are experienced
on account of the passage of time and the circumstance=
s in which one is
placed; and that they do not pertain to him.

He sees the=
 truth who sees that he is the omnipresent infinite consciousness
which enc=
ompasses within itself all that takes place everywhere at all
times.

He se=
es the truth who knows that the Self, which is as subtle as the
millionth p=
art of the tip of a hair divided a million times, pervades
everything.

He =
sees the truth who sees that there is no division at all between the self
a=
nd the other, and that the one infinite light of consciousness exists as
th=
e sole reality.

He sees the truth who sees that the non-dual consciousness=
 which indwells
all beings is omnipotent and omnipresent.

He sees the trut=
h who is not deluded into thinking that he is the body which
is subject to =
illness, fear, agitation, old age and death.

He sees the truth who sees th=
at all things are strung together in the Self
as beads are strung on a thre=
ad, and who knows "I am not the mind".

He sees the truth who sees all bein=
gs in the three worlds as his own family,
deserving of his sympathy and pro=
tection.

He sees the truth who knows that the Self alone exists and that t=
here is no
substance in objectivity.

He is unaffected who knows that pleas=
ure, pain, birth, death, etc., are all
the Self only.

He is firmly establi=
shed in the truth who feels: "What should I acquire,
what should I renounce=
, when all this is the one Self?"

Salutations to that abode of auspiciousn=
ess, who is filled with the supreme
realization that the entire universe is=
 truly Brahman alone, which remains
unchanged during all the apparent creat=
ion, existence and dissolution of the
universe.
