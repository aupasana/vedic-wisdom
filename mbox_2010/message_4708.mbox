 We misapprehend the ego
and call it intellect or mind.

Being of the natur=
e of Bliss,
why does one continue to crave for happiness?
To be rid of that=
 craving is itself salvation.
The Scriptures say, "You Are That."
The impar=
ting of that knowledge is their purpose.
The Realization must be
by your fi=
nding out who you are
and abiding as That, i. e., your Self
To be repeating=
 "I am that"
or "not this" is a waste of time.
For the worthy disciple
the =
work lies within
and not without.

There was no "I" thought in your sleep
w=
hereas it is present now.
The true "I" is not manifest
and the false "I" is=
 parading itself.
This false "I" is the obstacle
to your right knowledge.
F=
ind out wherefrom this false "I" arises.
Then it will disappear.
You will b=
e only what you are --
i. e., absolute Being.

Search for the source of the=
 "I" thought.
That is all one has to do.
The universe exists on account of =
the "I" thought.
If that ends, there is an end of misery, also.
The false "=
I" will end only when its source is sought.

The universe is like a paintin=
g on a screen.
That which rises and sinks is made up of what it rises from.=

The finality of the universe is God --
meditating on Him or on the seer, t=
he Self;
there is a mental vibration "I" to which all are reduced.
Tracing =
the source of "I",
the primal "I"-"I" alone remains,
and it is inexpressibl=
e.
The seat of Realization is within
and the seeker cannot find it as an ob=
ject outside him.
That seat is bliss, and is the core of all beings;
hence =
it is called the Heart.
The only useful purpose of the present birth
is to =
turn within and realize it.
There is nothing else to do.

Is there a mind i=
n the first place?
What you call mind is an illusion.
It starts from the "I=
"-thought.
Without the gross or subtle senses,
you cannot be aware of the b=
ody or the mind.
Still, it is possible for you to be without these senses.
=
In such a state, you are either asleep
or aware of the Self only.
Awareness=
 of Self is ever there.
Remain what you truly are
and this question will no=
t arise.

The Self is more intimate than the objects.
Find the subject [you=
r Self]
and the objects will take care of themselves.
the objects are seen =
by different persons
according to their outlook --
and these theories evolv=
ed.
But who is the seer,
the cognizer of these theories?
It is you.
Find yo=
ur Self.
Then there is an end to
these vagaries of the mind.

Yoga implies =
prior division and it means
later union of one with another.
Who is to be u=
nited with whom?
You are the seeker,
seeking union with something.
That som=
ething is apart from you.
Your Self is intimate to you.
You are aware of th=
e Self.
Seek it and be it.
That will expand as the infinite.

Man owes his =
movements to another Power,
whereas he thinks he does everything himself --=

just like a lame man bluffing that,
were he helped to stand up,
he would f=
ight and chase away the enemy.
Action is impelled by desire;
desire arises =
only after the rise of the ego;
and this ego owes its origin to a Higher Po=
wer
on which its existence depends.
It can not remain apart.
Why then pratt=
le, "I do, or I act, or I function"?
A Self-realized being cannot help but =
benefit the world.
His very existence is the highest good.

I exist now. I =
am the enjoyer.
I enjoy fruits of action.
I was in the past --
and shall be=
 in the future.
Who is this "I"?
Finding this "I" to be pure Consciousness
=
beyond action and enjoyment;
freedom and happiness are gained.
There is the=
n no effort,
for the Self is perfect
and there remains nothing more to gain=
.
