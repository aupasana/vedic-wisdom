Pranam,

Its an old thread. I recently joined this group. I was going throu=
gh old mails hence writing:
My humble input:

Common men in India was in de=
ep Tamas hence to invoke Rajas was first step. Swamiji asked to first get o=
ut of Tamas for Common men. He also advised to play FootBall instead of stu=
dying BhagwatGita.

I do not remember the words so please forgive me for an=
y mistake in above words. But i think i am not mis-representing it.

As Sri=
 Narasimha has said that Yogis advise based on desh-kal.


humbly,
Amit Kum=
ar

you, these are thoughts of an unrealized person and the worth can be next t=

or Sainbaba or any other such acknowledged spiritual giants, we tend to for=

se. Their individual ego is perfectly and completely tuned to universal ego=
. In short they *know* what they are doing. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis'.

 Relevant to our topic of discussion, I would say that if they ate meat or =
smoke cigar or chew tobacco or killed animals, they actually knew what they=
 are doing. There would be surely a specific purpose behind each and every =
action of theirs because as I said, they know complete background behind th=
eir each action and moreover their self identification is missing from the =
action and hence it is like Nature operates through them to accomplish a sp=
ecial purpose without binding them in any cause-effect chain.

 used to frequently say to all his disciples that Naren is very different f=
rom others. He has a blazing spiritual fire burning within him which can co=

 is also possible at the same time that he is nullifying some balanced Rina=
