Narasimhagaru, 
=C2=A0
Thank you for such a nice explanation. Even with not=
 maintaining Brahmacharya, I could see significant progress in terms of my =
control of temper etc. when I did Gayatri Japam in the past. Did not know t=
he significance of Brahmacharya then (in future I will practise with Brahma=
charya). But the way I did was it was one a lakh purascharana (daily 1000-3=
000 times) for a period of two months and then I did a homam to complete th=
e dasamsa in homam. For the homam, however, I have called about 10 people (=
Grihastas / Brahmacharis altogether) and we all did chant the mantra while =
I performed the homam. This is how our Sharmaji instructed us to do. So, is=
 a Dasamsa homam, satamsa for tarpanam, sahasramsa for marjanam and finally=
 dasamsa of shasramsa for feeding the number of brahmins (so basically, for=
 a laksha Gayatri, 10 brahmins must be fed, to finish the ritual of purasch=
arana). This is how I thought the big japams must be done. Can you shed mor=
e light on this?
 
=C2=A0
Also, Gayatri mantra is a 24 syllable mantra star=
ting with tatsavitur...., but if the vyahritis are added it becomes a 30 le=
tter mantra (om bhur bhu va ssu vah=C2=A0). How should this be practised? 3=
0, I suppose strengthens the 6th house, whereas the 24 strengthens the 12th=
 house, according to your explanation? Sorry for digressing into astrology =
! (but they are tightly integrated here and could not avoid this question).=
 Please tell me if my interpretation is right and also please tell me which=
 approach is better. 
=C2=A0

Namaste,

What he wrote was to do Savitri Gayatr=
i mantra 1000 times everyday in one sitting and do like that for 100 days a=
t a stretch without break. Then possibly give a break for a few days and do=
 for another 100 days. Like that, do for 3 stretches of 100 days each.

Of =
course, if needs no break, one can do 300 days in a row too. But, keeping b=
rahmacharya (abstinence) may be difficult for some people and hence the sug=
gestion of the break.

For success in any sadhana, brahmacharya is very imp=
ortant. Restraint from sex and control of anger and short-temper will help =
one avoid leakage of shakti (purifying energy). Everytime one experiences l=
ust, anger etc, one loses some shakti.

Every factor contributes a little t=
o success. Beard is useful. The tradition of growing beard exists in many r=
eligions and it is not without a reason. We discussed this sometime back.

=
If one is living a lifestyle where one avoids contact with any tempting sit=
uations altogether (e.g. living in a remote monastery), beard may or may no=
t add much value. But, if one is living a lifestyle where one comes in cont=
act with tempting situations regularly (e.g. living in the modern world wit=
h a family and job and a TV), beard can be very useful. As I said earlier w=
hen we discussed this, beard is not the complete solution but a small part =
of the solution. Just as a railing on the side of a hill road may stop a sl=
owly moving car from sliding off the hill at night but be unable to stop a =
fast moving car out of control, similarly a beard can help a person with de=
cent control over the mind to retain control in some tricky situations.

Tr=
imming beard is ok.

=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

If one indeed does 1000 times Gayatri =
(or any mantra for a couple of hours) everyday for one year while maintaini=
ng brahmacharya, 
while following the simple rules of same place, same time=
 everyday and facing the same direction, one will certainly make good progr=
ess. Brahmacharya is one key thing and sitting still with an erect back, ne=
ck and head with the eyes closed is the other thing. The probability of min=
d becoming still is almost zero if the body is not still. If the body can b=
e kept very still, there is a chance that mind will also become still for a=
 moment. If the mind is still for even a moment, it will cause great bliss.=
 As mind gets more used to being still, it will become still more often and=
 for longer times. Then various kinds of samadhis become possible.

gards,
Narasimha

This is a =
great mail and very inspiring. However, I have one question on Sri Manishji=
's advise on how to carry out the sadhana. He says do it for 100 days and r=
epeat the whole procedure for 3 times. So, should we do 3000 times japam in=
 a day for 100 days or do 1000 times every day for=C2=A0300 days? He also s=
