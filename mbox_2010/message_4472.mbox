What decides "which portion" of sanchita karma that one has to

Since different combinations=C2=A0are possible, how is this =
priority of X

It is decided by D=

In exception cases like suicide, do we say that it=
's a destiny or it's a=C2=A0free will used by an individual to run away fro=
m suffering?
The reason for asking this question is, usually it's possible =
to see suicidal tendencies in Jyotisha. If the indication of prarabdha karm=
a is suicide, then should we consider it as his karma for this life?

Namaste,

Everyone plays their allotted role. But=
 the roles are not static. They are dynamic and may undergo fine-tuning or =
modification or evolution from time to time (and life to life) based on how=
 we play our allotted roles. 

The role you are given is your destiny and h=
ow you play it is your free will. How you play your role now (free will) in=
fluences what role you are given in future (destiny).

If the role given to=
 you (e.g. Arjuna) is to kill your guru (Drona) and relatives, you cannot e=
scape it. But you can either do it with a hateful mind or a guilty mind or =
you can do it with a calm mind. If the role given to you (e.g. Janaka) is t=
o rule a big kingdom, you cannot escape and do penances in a forest. But yo=
u can either rule the kingdom with a proud and attached mind or with a calm=
 mind. If the role given to you (e.g. Swami Samarth Ramadas) is to guide a =
mighty king (Shivaji) in resisting the invading muslim
 kings, you cannot e=
scape it. But you can either do it with an attached and agitated mind or a =
calm mind.

People in the examples I mentioned above engaged in what may se=
em like material actions, but they did them after overcoming attachments an=
d with an equanimous mind.

As I keep saying, what you do is a secondary fa=
ctor and how you do it is primary. Even as we engage in actions that we bel=
ieve to be our dharma, we should work on our attitude and increase surrende=
r. When one has surrendered to god and is able to look at pleasure and pain=
, praise and censure in the same way, then one's dharma will be far clearer=
 to one. One whose mind is densely conditioned by duality and desires will =
see one's dharma through the coloring of that conditioning and may misjudge=
. On the other hand, one with a clear mind with very little conditioning wi=
ll see one's dharma clearer.

In simpler words, one who heavily identifies =
with the body and wants
 comforts and pleasures of the body will see one's =
dharma from that motivation. One may identify with body, with a group of pe=
ople, with a deity etc. As is the identification, so is the conditioning an=
d so is one's vision of one's dharma.

Though everyone is playing their all=
otted role, some have densely conditioned minds and unable to see their dha=
rma clearly and pursuing adharma. As a result, they may continue to be allo=
tted roles where densely conditioned minds restrict their actions, in futur=
e.

Some have very clear minds and able to see their dharma clearly and pur=
suing higher dharma. As a result, they may continue to allotted roles where=
 lighter and lighter mental conditioning restricts them and eventually they=
 become free.

One can try to use free will to move from the former case to=
 the latter case.

Best regards,
Narasimha
