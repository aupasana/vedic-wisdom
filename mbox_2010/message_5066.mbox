Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] "Invading the Sacred"

=C2=A0 
I'm one of=
 the co-editors of the book. Thanks for the messages of support. There 
is =
a lot of work to be done in this area. For example, Wendy Doniger, who is t=
he 
culprit behind a lot of negative misportrayals of Hindus and Hinduism (=
as 
described in the book) recently wrote a history of Hinduism book (thoug=
h she 
admits she is not a historian)=C2=A0that she is aiming to have be us=
ed as a standard 
textbook in Indian schools in the high school levels (as =
stated in the 
introduction to the book). There have been some articles and=
 other reports 
written critiquing the book--for example, I wrote an articl=
e in Outlook India 
refuting her claim that Rama threw out Sita because he =
was afraid of becoming a 
sex addict like his father, Dasaratha, etc.--but =
there needs to be more of a 
coordinated movement not only to refute such w=
ritings but to produce scholarly 
and objective descriptions of Hinduism th=
at can replace the more bigoted / 
denigratory writings. 


I am not really=
 into politics, but I can tell you from having been born and 
raised in Ame=
rica, that the school envirionment (including at the very liberal 
schools =
I attended) is poisoned for learning about Hinduism. The most 
frustrating =
thing for me as a young girl wanting to learn about Hinduism was the 
lack =
of resources--I would go to the Hinduism shelf at the library or 
bookstore=
=C2=A0only to find exposes on the "cult of the Hare Krishnas" or trashy 
bo=
oks on Tantric sex, or go read textbooks or other scholarly books on Hindui=
sm 
at school only to be inundated with denouncements of caste and mockerie=
s of the 
Hindu pantheon as, at best, amusing mythology or, at worst, as a =
mythology that 
reflected certain disturbing pathologies of the Indic peopl=
e.

Had I not the great fortune of finding my guru and other true acharyas =
who were 
able to provide me a correct understanding of Hinduism, I may hav=
e eventually 
given up my search and lost out not only on knowing my herita=
ge but on finding 
the path of sadhana.

It is for this reason that I think=
 this work is so important and urgent.

More information on these issues in=
 general is available at 
www.invadingthesacred.com. I also have many extra=
 copies of the book. If you or 
someone you know would be interested, pleas=
e let me know and I can arrange to 
have copies shipped. We are trying to p=
rovide copies to temples and local 
libraries so that it is there as a reso=
urce for those who are interested. 


Warm regards,
Aditi
