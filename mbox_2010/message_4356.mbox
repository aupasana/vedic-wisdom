 Devotee:

How do the triple factors (i.e., knower, known and knowledge), w=
hich are
absent in deep sleep, samadhi, etc., manifest themselves in the Se=
lf (in the
states of waking and dreaming)?

Ramana Maharshi:

>From the Self=
 there arise in succession

(i) Chidabhasa (reflected consciousness) which =
is a kind of luminosity.
(ii) Jiva (the individual consciousness) or the se=
er or the first concept.
(iii) Phenomena, that is the world.

Devotee:

How=
 can there be a connection between the Self which is pure knowledge and
the=
 triple factors which are relative knowledge?

Ramana Maharshi:


CINEMA SH=
OWSELFThe lamp inside (the apparatus)The Self The lens in front of
the lamp=
The pure (sattvic) mind close to the Self.The film which is a long
series o=
f (separate photos).The stream of latent tendencies consisting of
subtle th=
oughts. The lens, the light passing through it and the lamp, which
together=
 form the focused light.The mind, the illumination of it and the
Self,which=
 together form the seer or the Jiva.The light passing through the
lens and =
falling on the screen. The light of the Self emerging from the mind
through=
 the senses, and falling on the world.The various kinds of pictures
appeari=
ng in the light of the screen.The various forms and names appearing
as the =
objects perceived in the light of the world. The mechanism which sets
the f=
ilm in motion.The divine law manifesting the latent tendencies of the
mind.=


Just as the pictures appear on the screen as long as the film throws the
=
shadows through the lens,so the phenomenal world will continue to appear to=

the individual in the waking and dream states as long as there are latent
=
mental impressions.Just as the lens magnifies the tiny specks on the film t=
o
a huge size and as a number of pictures are shown in a second, so the min=
d
enlarges the sproutlike tendencies into tree-like thoughts and shows in a=

second innumerable worlds. Again, just as there is only the light of the
l=
amp visible when there is no film, so the Self alone shines without the
tri=
ple factors when the mental concepts in the form of tendencies are absent
i=
n the states of deep sleep, swoon and samadhi. Just as the lamp illumines
t=
he lens, etc., while remaining unaffected,the Self illumines the ego
(chida=
bhasa), etc., while remaining unaffected.
