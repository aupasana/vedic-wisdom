Namaste

I felt like sharing one incident from the life of Swami Vivekanand=
a ,it might be particularly useful in light of the ongoing discussion about=
 Ravana, Ego's ,great souls and metaphysical stories.I often am in awe of t=
he amount of scholarly knowledge that various members share on this forum,k=
indly excuse and forgive me if this post  offends any of the member's feeli=
ngs. 

This particular incident from the Swami's life can be read in the Pr=
abuddha Bharata and also in the complete works of Swami Vivekananda.

Once =
a young group of students approached the swami to solicit his opinions on t=
he Gita. This is what the Swami had to say

"
Be strong, my young friends; =
that is my advice to you. You will be nearer to Heaven through football tha=
n through the study of the Gita.

 These are bold words; but I have to say =
them, for I love you. I know where the shoe pinches. I have gained a little=
 experience. You will understand the Gita better with your biceps, your mus=
cles, a little stronger.You will understand the mighty strength of Krishna =
with your muscles a little stronger.

This is the great fact: Strength is l=
ife, weakness is death. Strength is felicity, life eternal, immortal; weakn=
ess is constant strain and misery: Weakness is death.
To succeed, you must =
have tremendous perseverance, tremendous will. `I will drink the ocean, say=
s the preserving soul, `at my will mountains will crumble up.' Have that so=
rt of energy, that sort of will, work hard, and you reach the goal."


Rava=
na ,Lord Rama , Krishna , Jaya ,Vijaya...Rama Krishna Paramahamsa, Vimalana=
nda.

How can one judge them when they are not on the same level as these g=
reat souls. To even understand the Gita the Swami advocated a strong mind i=
n a strong body to understand the mighty strength of Lord Krishna.

Does th=
is not mean we are better off doing our Sadhana instead of trying to figure=
 out the mysteries of the Metaphysical stories.My intention is not to say s=
tories are irrelevant, my intention is only to say when one's energies are =
limited why not use them towards sadhana each second. 

At the end of the d=
ay if one is not steeped in that level of consciousness he or she might not=
 experience the metaphysical story within himself and might not grasp the i=
nner meaning and then the story no longer is true for them..
