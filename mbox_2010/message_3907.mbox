Respected Sri Narsimha Sir,

Thanks on explaining all about what shakti is.=
 That was very helpful. 

There are constant discussions on how god tests h=
is disciples. I am curious to know at what point testing begins. What if a =
sadhak fails? How severely does he get punished? Finally can god whom we pr=
ay so much punish us so badly.

There are people who feel the need of guru.=
 I feel like sharing something about my experience with respect to it. I ha=
ve a small side business and any money I get from it gives me happiness as =
lot of hard work is involved. When I started the homam it was  doing ok bus=
iness. After starting homam the business picked up. Oneday I got vulgar tho=
ughts in mind and the business went down immediately. I found out my mistak=
e worked on it. My business picked up again then I started getting greedy f=
or more money. Down went the business again. I worked on controlling my min=
d towards temptation of money. Business picked up again. After a very long =
time I had a heavy fight with my husband the other day hurled abuses and no=
w my business is down again. I know this time God wants me to work on anger=
.
How beautifully God is acting guru and taming me? Simply amazing!!

Regar=
ds,
Priya
