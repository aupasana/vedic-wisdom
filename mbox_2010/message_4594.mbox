Namaste,

If I don't reply, it may also be because I have no worthwhile answer to share!
 
Anyway, anga and kara nyasa is best explained visually. I will try to create a video.
 
However, the physical action is only a small part of it. For example, when we say "gIM tarjanIbhyaaM namaH", we touch the tips of index fingers with the tips of corresponding thumbs. At the same time, one has to focus attention on the small chakra (realm of awareness) in the index finger tip and imagine it to reverberate with the beeja "gIM". The external action is easy, but the corresponding internal action is not easy.
 
Nyasa means placement. When we say "gAM aMguShThaabhyaaM namaH", "gIM tarjanibhyaaM namaH" etc, we *place* syllables gAM, gIM etc in different body parts.
 
This is why I suggest taking it easy if one does not know how to do it. As a matter of fact, even people who think they know it do not really know it and they are just engaging in an external action. That tradition is merely meant for preserving the external symbols for future generations. Often, external symbols are sufficient for an intelligent and evolved soul that has re-incarnated to figure out the internal significations and experiment. So tradition keeps key exteranl symbols alive, though they may not really help much in one's sadhana.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
