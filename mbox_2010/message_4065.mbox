Namaste,
  
  Somebody I know who faced a similar situation.
  Here are the=
 possible answers in brief.
  ***
   It is possible to do homa inside the r=
oom.. But some things need to be taken care of  assuming the kundam is smal=
l.

   1)  carpet needs to be covered preferably with some near fireproof/o=
r preferably fully fireproof sheets The covered area should be several time=
s bigger compared to the size of the kundam. 
Additionally the stone/cerami=
c slab is a necessity
   to prevent heating of the floor even though the ku=
ndam we get out
  here (in US) is also raised.

   2)  If dry coconut and G=
hee is used as the main material the smoke is very minimal or not much noti=
ceable.. But a bit of it will be there when the fire is about to burn out w=
ith the last red glow..
Start the fire with only 2/3 pieces of dry coconut =
(about the size
    of a quarter each. Materials like puffed rice,sesame se=
eds etc give very less smoke.. however some fruits and nuts do give some sm=
oke..depending on their type.but you could avoid putting
in variety of mate=
rials if you are doing it indoors.  

 3) One need not memorize the sanskri=
t invocations.. but can
read it out from printed material. 

4) Narasimha's=
 Ganapathy Homam manual has got lot of info the practical aspects of it. Sp=
ecifically see the Appendix D.

a_ganapati_homam_english.pdf

Also you can see the video he made here..see =
the raised platform,,covered area could be larger indoors..

Hope it helps..
Regards
Shashi
