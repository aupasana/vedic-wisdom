Dear Sindhu ji,
=C2=A0
Thank you for your response. Mine follows.
=C2=A0
"M=
ugging up of vedas" - mugging of vedas is not like mugging up an engineerin=
g text book for the exam. It is a sadhana in itself. upto 12-13 hours=C2=A0=
aday of mantra chanting for 4 to 5 years coupled with one's nitya karma lik=
e sandhya vandanam, brahma yajnam, samidadhanam (the homa performed in the =
morning and evening by the student). It involves santha, anusantha and avru=
tis. The sadhana continues until brahma (mantra) becomes his power (varchas=
) and thereafter for the rest of the life time. I have come across a schola=
r whose fingers keep moving even in sleep in accordance with the rythm of t=
he mantra. He has transformed himself into the mantra. The veda is installe=
d inside him. This is no less than any sadhana we are speaking about.
=C2=
=A0
You see, the reason why I mentioned this is again because of a document=
ary film that was made by Sri Staal regarding the Agnicayana he (and his te=
am) had sponsered in Kerala. He showed some "vedic" priests who chant vario=
us mantra from the Vedas for hours everyday for almost all their lives. Whe=
n he asked them some pertinent queries about what these mantras might mean =
etc, the priests simply shook their head and came up with a very tame reply=
 that this is how they have been taught to do things. No wonder Sri Staal c=
ame up with the fancy=C2=A0birds and bees theory from such inputs. 
=C2=A0
=
I agree that chanting of the Vedas for hours on end is surely a sadhana. Fo=
r that matter, any focused attention given to any work becomes a sadhana in=
 it's own rights. But my point is, to understand the real import of the Ved=
as, one must do sadhana for spiritual realization and then and only then ca=
n one really claim to say what is truely Vedic and what is not. Sadhana for=
 God realization is the path, and when the realization dawns in sufficient =
degrees, one maybe able to get a really clear perspective of what exactly t=
he Vedas talk about. Not with energy flowing through Ida nadi, nor with ene=
rgy flowing through pingla nadi can one understand what the Vedas truely ar=
e. But with energy flowing through the susumna nadi, there is hope! That is=
 experiential and a result of sadhana aimed at realizing the Self.
=C2=A0
F=
or this transformed being learning bhashya is not necessary. He knows even =
beforehand what is there in the bhashya and what it means in various planes=
.
=C2=A0
My view is that, Vedas are absolute uncorruptable knowledge, and t=
herefore before the above transformation happens, ones understanding of the=
 Vedas and what=C2=A0really constitues the ambit of Vedic knowledge will be=
 questionable, if not outright incorrect. Hence, I see no value in statemen=
ts like such and such ritual is what Vedas is all about and such and such i=
s not. Most people who make such statements are nowhere close to any states=
 of realization. Mere intellectual assessements are not really of much valu=
e.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
If we call Sayana's commentary a distortion, we will have =
to disown Yaska as well.
=C2=A0
Well, if you like Sayanacharya's commentari=
es, so be it. I do not consider it sacroscant. So we have to=C2=A0just resp=
ectfully disagree with each other:). Hope that is fine with you. 
=C2=A0
=
=C2=A0
2. "Vasistha spoke the Yoga Vasistham"
=C2=A0
Who is the real author=
 of yoga vasishtam Vasishta or Valmiki ?
=C2=A0
Valmiki notes what Vasistha=
 speaks to Rama.
=C2=A0
3. "The vedic rishis were famous for doing elaborat=
e yagyas and homas. By extension of your above logic, it means they did not=
 believe in Advaita since they used to engage themselves in homas and yagya=
s?"
=C2=A0
Advaita ( or for that matter vedanta) is only one of the six dar=
sanas (or ways of looking at it). Dvaita, Vishitadvaita and Meemamsa have d=
ifferent views. 
=C2=A0
True. Yes there were have been philosophical fights=
, but that was mostly in the Upanishadic and Pouranik periods and not reall=
y in the=C2=A0 original Vedic period. Infact, people (indologists)=C2=A0are=
 not even sure of what constitues the real Vedic age, so getting an accurat=
e description is a far cry. 
=C2=A0
Sri Ramakrishna and most of his discipl=
es - who were all self-realized saints - would often comment that from the =
perspective of a sadhaka of God, these philosophies were never ment to be i=
n contradiction to one another but supplementary to each other. They explai=
ned in many of their writings how each of them (philosophies)=C2=A0had a pl=
ace and a stage and how each were essentially supportive of the different s=
tages and paths leading one to the=C2=A0realization of the absolute non-dif=
ferentiated Brahman. I find this explanation more appealing and realistic.
=
=C2=A0
I was talking about the ones who composed the Veda mantras. They wer=
e all knowing, and all knowledgebale seers. The Upanishats and various eman=
ating philosophies within the ambit of our Sanatana Dharma, all undeniably=
=C2=A0trace their roots to the Vedas. That means, the satha darshanas are n=
ot outside of the realm of the core Vedas. Therefore, the ones who composed=
 the vedic hymns were both jyanis, vigyanis as well as performers of elabor=
ate fire rituals, all combined together. There is no conflict here. 
=C2=A0=

Just like Vasistha says in the Yoga Vasistham, God realization is a bird w=
ith two wings -right action with the right knowledge. Either of the wings n=
ot functioning, makes the bird come crashing down. 
=C2=A0

4. "Can you kin=
dly enlighten us, why is Usha accorded an elevated status".
=C2=A0
No surpi=
rse, That is the essence of veda. Not only usha, amavasya, purnima. kuhu, s=
inivali, wind, rain, cloud, vidyut,earth, fire, storm, water, medha (intell=
ect), pranas,oushadhis, vanaspatis, nakshatras, all are accorded elevated s=
tatus. That's how veda is.
=C2=A0
Sorry but that is not really an answer at=
 all! It is not at all the essence of the Vedas, unless you belong to the s=
ect of west influenced spurious indologists who believe that the vedic hymn=
s were battle cries and=C2=A0general poetry composed by a group of ravaging=
 barbarians who were too awed by the wind and the sun and the dawn and othe=
r natural phenomenon.
=C2=A0
Let me repeat the question I had asked in my p=
revious mail. If this is the essence of the Vedas, can you explain in a log=
ical coherent manner, how exactly does these simple natural phenomenons lea=
d to the elevated Upanishatic philosophies, when every school of thought in=
side Hinduism traced its roots to the core Vedas? How does one explain this=
 so called=C2=A0jump without taking an allegorical view of the Vedic hymns?=
 
=C2=A0
5. "The way one can learn is different based on the different mode=
ls of the aeroplanes in which one learns to fly!"
=C2=A0
If one has flying =
experience on a cessana alone he will not be allowed to fly a boeing. This =
is why I said I am only against mixing up.
=C2=A0
One who has learnt flying=
 a cessana can very well learn to fly a boeing if he so wishes. It can remo=
ve his inhibitions about flying and in future, if God will, can learn other=
s as well. What harm therefore in learning to fly, with any model what so e=
ver? None absolutely.
=C2=A0
6. "No. Many self-realized people have 'mixed'=
 these artifically created boundaried and achived and experienced higher st=
ates. Anything that leads to God is good."
=C2=A0
They have been lucky. For=
 each succesful one there may be many who have also failed miserably.
=C2=
=A0
=C2=A0I consider this to be an unfounded fear. Real sadhana for God rea=
lization often does not follow such aritificial boundaries. Realization God=
 is never a matter of luck, but a product of intense sadhana and patience. =
And doing a daily homam of any deity is a=C2=A0furiously beautiful sadhana.=
 Many are already doing it, many more will do in future. 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0If o=
ne with all purity and best of intentions=C2=A0gives ahutis =C2=A0water on =
agni instead of ghee, what will be the outcome ? Intention can not justify =
flouting of rules. Rules only support and promote intention.
=C2=A0
Rules=
=C2=A0prohibiting a person from even trying the ritual is far detremental t=
han making a flawed=C2=A0attempt and learning in the course of it. 
=C2=A0
=
Further=C2=A0more, the manuals given by Narasimha is definitely not incorre=
ct. Otherwise, so many would not have been able to do various homas of=C2=
=A0different deities=C2=A0for so long on a regular basis and experience=C2=
=A0things. This is not an empty claim, but one that is very, very=C2=A0real=
.=C2=A0

Dear Shri.Rajarshi,
=C2=A0
1."Thank you for the interesting example abo=
ve. But I have a very pertinent question regarding this.=C2=A0 And what exa=
ctly does it mean by saying one learned in the Vedas? Can one, who=C2=A0has=
 mugged up the Vedas and a few commentaries of the same, without experienci=
ng any sort of self-realization, be called a "srotriya"? Does such a non-re=

 This is no less than any sadhana we are speaking about.
=C2=A0

ansformed being learning bhashya is not necessary. He knows even beforehand=
 what is there in the bhashya and what it means in various planes.
=C2=A0
F=
or information, Sayana's commentaries are based on the nirukta (meaning of =
vedic terms) of Yaska. Nirukta is one of the vedangas. If we call Sayana's =
commentary a distortion, we will have to disown Yaska as well.
=C2=A0
2. "V=
asistha spoke the Yoga Vasistham"
=C2=A0
Who is the real author of yoga vas=
ishtam Vasishta or Valmiki ?
=C2=A0
3. "The vedic rishis were famous for do=
ing elaborate yagyas and homas. By extension of your above logic, it means =
they did not believe in Advaita since they used to engage themselves in hom=
as and yagyas?"
=C2=A0
Advaita ( or for that matter vedanta) is only one of=
 the six darsanas (or ways of looking at it). Dvaita, Vishitadvaita and Mee=
mamsa have different views. By Vedic rishis do you mean the=C2=A0rishis who=
 composed the veda mantras or the later ones also=C2=A0who philosphized on =
them. The views are not homogenous. The advaita vada is the most propagated=
 one among the general public and has great appeal . The other views also a=
ppear to be equally valid if you read them. There were rishis who subscribe=
d to the advaita vada, and others who did not.=C2=A0 
=C2=A0
Yajno hi manta=
eirdevatamuddi sya dravyasya daanam - Yajna is providing dravya to the deva=
ta with the mantra. This is another view.
=C2=A0
4. "Can you kindly enlight=
en us, why is Usha accorded an elevated status".
=C2=A0
No surpirse, That i=
s the essence of veda. Not only usha, amavasya, purnima. kuhu, sinivali, wi=
nd, rain, cloud, vidyut,earth, fire, storm, water, medha (intellect), prana=
s,oushadhis, vanaspatis, nakshatras, all are accorded elevated status. That=
's how veda is.
=C2=A0

My only contention is that if you are performing=

Nama=
ste Sindhu ji,
=C2=A0
Although this mail is addressed to Narasimha, I had a=
 few points to make since the mail is in the forum.
=C2=A0
and do not viola=
te the fundamental principles of vedic rituals.
=C2=A0
What exactly is the =
"fundamental principles" of a vedic ritual? In my little=C2=A0understanding=
, it is the=C2=A0goal which is=C2=A0God-realization, which is the=C2=A0only=
=C2=A0"fundamental principle". Anything else is dispensable and therefore n=
ot eternal. Vedas, as all self-realized saints have told us, are about eter=
nal truths, nothing short. 
=C2=A0
It will be interesting here to point out=
 that when some sections of samavedis when they perform sraadham=C2=A0do th=
e=C2=A0hormam on the palm of the bhokta brahmin. It is called panihomam. Ev=
en the fire is not present there. It is based on a dictum called " brahmana=
sya dakshine haste hotavyam" - the homa is to be performed on the right han=
d of the brahmin. It is believed that agni is ever present in the right han=
d of the srotriya (one learned in the veda) brahmin. There is no defect her=
e. It is as per sastra. Now if you modify this and say that homa can be per=
fromed on the right glove worn by a brahmin, then the problem arises.
=C2=
=A0
Thank you for the interesting example above. But I have a very pertinen=
t question regarding this.=C2=A0 And what exactly does it mean by saying on=
e learned in the Vedas? Can one, who=C2=A0has mugged up the Vedas and a few=
 commentaries of the same, without experiencing any sort of self-realizatio=
n, be called a "srotriya"? Does such a non-realized being have "fire" in hi=
s right hand? Never! 
=C2=A0
A real "srotriya" is one who has realized the =
Aatman, not in words, but in the states of samadhi. Such a being "may have"=
 spiritual abilities of fire in his "palm". Anyone else, irrespective of wh=
ether he is=C2=A0born in=C2=A0brhamin family, is merely following a blind t=
radition without having experienced anything and thus violating the essence=
 of the Vedas and merely sticking to external rules which have no spiritual=
 consequence. What use is such=C2=A0a=C2=A0'vedic' rituals, if at all they =
can be called as vedic. That which is devoide of the essence, is an empty s=
hell which is bound to reform or perish in the course of time. 
=C2=A0
Ther=
efore, for me, it hardly matters if the ritual is done on the bare palms or=
 a gloved hands of a person who has never experienced the Self. Both, are i=
n clear violation of the Vedic essence.
=C2=A0
Homam is a ritualistic form =
of worship and if you bring in advaita vada in it it doesn't work.
=C2=A0
T=
his is definitely incorrect! The vedic rishis were famous for doing elabora=
te yagyas and homas. By extension of your above logic, it means they did no=
t believe in Advaita since they used to engage themselves in homas and yagy=
as?=C2=A0 
=C2=A0
Vasistha spoke the Yoga Vasistham, which is a pinnacle of=
 advaitha princples, and Ramayana speaks of different yagyas performed by h=
im and Vishwamitra.=C2=A0 Does it mean they did not "believe" in advaita? 
=
=C2=A0
Your above statement stems from an incorrect understanding of what i=
s Advaitha Vada. As long as one is trapped in duality, merely saying that I=
 believe in Advaitha Vada does not make one become so. I can keep believing=
 that I am Bill Gates, but that=C2=A0won't make me Bill Gates. Rather=C2=A0=
I shall remain merely as a self deluded entity. Untill one actually experie=
nces the state of non-duality, theoritical talk of "All- is Brahman" is sel=
f-delusion. 
=C2=A0
Adwaith is a state to be achieve. It needs sustained an=
d serious sadhana. No wonder the Rishis of yore, who were all self-realized=
 beings - and had experienced the state of=C2=A0Advaitha - used to perform =
such long penances, including elaborate fire rituals on a daily basis. 
=C2=
=A0
=C2=A0
It is not a question of whether it is more elaborate or less ela=
borate or which is inferior or which is superior. It is a question of wheth=
er it is correct and based on what vedic authority.
=C2=A0
The question is =
not about being based on "which vedic authority" BUT, is the sadhana bearin=
g fruits? Is it transforming the individual? Irrespective of which vedic 'a=
uthority' says what, if a said sadhana is not leading to experiantial knowl=
edge and states, it is useless for a genuine sadhaka. Therefore, the only w=
ay to judge is to perform the sadhana and experience for oneself! And this =
is why there are so many who are already doing the homas on a daily basis. =
Some have experienced paritally, some are yet to. And each experience merel=
y rivets one's mind to the sadhana more and more thus plunging in deeper an=
d deeper. A sadhaka has little use for dry theory. That which cannot be exp=
erienced, is of no consequence. It is this perspective that any sadhana, no=
t just the ones mentioned by Narasimha, has to be judged by a genuine sadha=
ka. 
=C2=A0

2. "What I teach is ONE procedure for those who do not know an=
y."
=C2=A0
Are there different ways you teach a person to fly an aeroplane =
depending on what he knows and what he does ?
=C2=A0
The flying of the aero=
plane is the same. The way one can learn is different based on the differen=
t models of the aeroplanes in which one learns to fly!
=C2=A0
3. "Knowledge=
 of *external rituals* is relative and can never be absolute. It evolves ba=
sed on desa-kaala-paatra. There is nothing impure or corrupt about it."
=C2=
=A0
Rituals do evolve around desa and kaala but if it starts evolving aroun=
d paatra it is a dangerous trend.
=C2=A0
Paatra is a product of the desa an=
d kaala, not uninfluenced by the other two. That is why these three are use=
d in tandem. 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
4. "The only knowledge that should (and can) be=
 preserved without corruption is knowledge that is *absolute*. Veda, or the=
 knowledge of imperishable Self, alone is absolute knowledge. Knowledge of =
*external rituals* is relative and can never be absolute".
=C2=A0
Sir, hone=
stly, have you ever read the vedas to know what is inside them ? or for tha=
t matter the Sayana bhashya. other than in the ritualistic context. I am qu=
oting the above mantras because they are commonly known.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
This=
 is the precisely the reason why maybe a Vivekananda had clearly stated tha=
t the available interpretations of the Vedas do not do justice to it's esse=
nce. Selective words from here and there really do not prove that the Vedas=
 are merely a set of rituals! This kind of an intepretation leads to a fall=
acy where-in one celebrated western commentator on the Vedas believes that =
the Purusha shukta in an example of human-scarfice practised in the Vedas. =
I am sure you will disagree with this. 
=C2=A0
Can you kindly enlighten us,=
 why is Usha accorded an elevated status? Usha is merely a dawn. What is so=
 big deal about an average dawn, so much so that one needs to address hymns=
 to it? Or for that matter other pantheon of Vedic deities from the Rig Ved=
as, which to the cursory reader, gives an impression of mere nature worship=
ping pagan's attempting elevated poetry? And if the average word by by word=
 translations or a core ritualistic view=C2=A0is all there is to the Vedas,=
 pray enlighten, why is there is a gap in the philosophical structure betwe=
en the so called pre-historic vedic hymns vs that of the Upanishadic period=
? And all the Upanishads seems to claim all philosphical authority from the=
 Vedas itself? How can this gap in the understanding of the two contexts be=
 bridged, unless one takes an allegorical view of the recordings of=C2=A0 t=
he Vedas, just like in the case of pre classical Greek orphic-myths and the=
ir later day derivatives?
=C2=A0
=C2=A0

Any path, vedic, agamic, yogic, ta=
ntrik, aghori,=C2=A0if rightly followed exclusively and fully can lead to t=

=C2=

De=

=C2=A0
Thanks for your reply.
=C2=A0
1. "There are many sta=
ndard homam procedures in the world today, some more elaborate than what we=
 teach and some more brief. " - 
=C2=A0
Please clarify whether the homa pro=
cedure taught by you belongs to the vedic system. If so, which authoritativ=
e text have you relied upon? Or is it one designed by yourself keeping the =
convenience factor in mind ?
=C2=A0
There are many procedures even within t=
he vedic system for performing homam. Each established procedure given by a=
charyas=C2=A0 is complete=C2=A0in itself and do not violate the fundamental=
 principles of vedic rituals.
=C2=A0
It will be interesting here to point o=
ut that when some sections of samavedis when they perform sraadham=C2=A0do =
the=C2=A0hormam on the palm of the bhokta brahmin. It is called panihomam. =
Even the fire is not present there. It is based on a dictum called " brahma=
nasya dakshine haste hotavyam" - the homa is to be performed on the right h=
and of the brahmin. It is believed that agni is ever present in the right h=
and of the srotriya (one learned in the veda) brahmin. There is no defect h=
ere. It is as per sastra. Now if you modify this and say that homa can be p=
erfromed on the right glove worn by a brahmin, then the problem arises.
=C2=
=A0
As you have said, any system of worship is acceptable. There are so man=
y religions and cults all around the world. Nobody objects. If you call som=
ething vedic, please make sure that it conforms to the vedic tenets.
=C2=A0=

Homam is a ritualistic form of worship and if you bring in advaita vada in=
 it it doesn't work.
=C2=A0
It is not a question of whether it is more elab=
orate or less elaborate or which is inferior or which is superior. It is a =
question of whether it is correct and based on what vedic authority. If you=
 are promoting this homa procedure as one of your own design, there is no o=
bjection. On the contrary, if you need the sanction of vedic authority for =
it, please=C2=A0answer within the ambit of vedic knowledge=C2=A0if doubts a=
re raised.
=C2=A0
The apprehension is that in the year 2000 you said,
=C2=

"I cannot possibly finish this preface without expressing my deep grati=
tude for my 
guru Pt. Sanjay Rath, who has been a constant source of enligh=
tenment, 
encouragement and inspiration. I am eternally grateful to him"

and now you say
=C2=A0
"In my well-considered view, Sanjay ji got so=

=C2=A0
Yes, his teachings contain fascinating philosophizati=

 always maintains an air of "I know more, but will teach later". It is conv=

Namaste,

Thanks for your views. There are many=
 standard homam procedures in the world today, some more elaborate than wha=
t we teach and some more brief. I do not care exactly what procedure one us=
es and I will be happy if more and more people do homam *regularly*, irresp=
ective of the exact procedure used! What I teach is ONE procedure for those=
 who do not know any. If you are initiated into a different procedure that =
you can do daily, please go ahead and do it daily the way you know it. That=
 will make us very happy. However, if the method you know cannot be done da=
ily, please consider what I taught, which is simple enough to do daily.

* =

Suppose there are rules and protocols on how one should serve lunch to=
 one's parents, e.g. how to place the plates, spoons, forks, soup bowls, dr=
ink cups, dessert bowls etc and how and in what order to serve various item=
s in those containers. Suppose the protocol is so complex that one cannot d=
o it everyday and calls one's parents for a lunch once every few months.

I=
s that better or is it better to relax the rules and protocols to make it l=
ess formal and serve lunch to parents everyday?

* * *

The only knowledge that should (and can) be preserved without corr=
uption is knowledge that is *absolute*. Veda, or the knowledge of imperisha=
ble Self, alone is absolute knowledge.

Knowledge of *external rituals* is =
relative and can never be absolute. It evolves based on desa-kaala-paatra. =
There is nothing impure or corrupt about it.

At the end of the day, the ke=
y is whether one is actually doing some sadhana on a regular basis or not, =
whether it is causing internal transformation in one or not, and whether it=
 helps in one's spiritual progress or not.

* * *

Let me cut & paste a sec=
tion from a writeup I wrote for an upcoming occasion. It contains an analog=
y given earlier and addresses some relevant issues.

------------ ---------=
 --------
Do Vedas Describe External Rituals

Some people believe that Veda=
 describes the specifics about various external yagyas. Veda is supposed to=
 be absolute, timeless and uncreated knowledge that is not bound by desa-ka=
ala-paatra. How can descriptions of specific external rituals be unbound by=
 desa-kaala-paatra?

Though Sayanacharya=E2=80=99s celebrated commentary on=
 RigVeda is ritualistic in nature, Aurobindo Ghose had a different take in =
his =E2=80=9CSecret of the Veda=E2=80=9D. His view is that Veda talks about=
 absolute truths about the inner self and not relative truths about externa=
l matters. Agni or Fire symbolizes the divine Will. That is why it is the i=
mmortal in mortals. Its rhythm will devour everything that is perishable an=
d purify all. While fire in a fire ritual symbolizes the divine Will, vario=
us offerings in it symbolize various aspects of one=E2=80=99s conditioning =
and the smoke symbolizes one=E2=80=99s passions and desires.

Metaphor: Ved=
ic Homam vs Aagamic Homam

Notions that so and so yagya ritual is sanctione=
d by Veda and so and so aagamic/tantric yagya ritual is not sanctioned by V=
eda can be put in perspective using a metaphor.

Once there were many peopl=
e who lived near the sea [Aatman]. They regularly sat by the sea and enjoye=
d the sight and sound of the sea [absorbed in Aatman most of the time]. The=
y described the sea in some nice cryptic poems [Veda].

As people started l=
iving a little away from the sea [less spiritually evolved], someone had to=
 put together some instructions on how to reach the sea. He said, "keep wal=
king towards east" and the instructions grew with time. People faithfully f=
ollowed the instructions [rituals].

People started moving further and furt=
her inland and started living in a landlocked desert far away from the sea.=
 This generation had never seen a pool of water like a lake, let alone a se=
a. They faithfully performed the ritual of walking towards east, but did no=
t find sea. They debated endlessly whether one had to walk one mile or two =
miles or three miles and formed different schools of thought. Some walked t=
heir chosen distance, found a tree or a building or some interesting object=
 and even became satisfied that that was sea!

Then came some great person,=
 whose instincts led him to take a horse instead of walking and ride it for=
 a long distance [use of other tools]. He did find the sea after a few mont=
hs. He put together newer instructions to reach the sea, which included rid=
ing a horse [new =C3=A4gama and tantra].

People performing the old rituals=
 objected to this and said "but then this horse thing is not granted by the=
 book of sea. This is a new path and different from the "pure" sea ritual" =
[pure Vedic ritual]. By now, people did not even understand what the crypti=
c poems of the original "book of sea" mean, but they simply believed that t=
hose poems taught the old "pure" sea rituals that they were used to. They w=
ere blissfully unaware that the original instructions were meant for someon=
e already close to sea and the newer instructions came from someone who act=
ually saw the sea and knew where they currently lived and how to get to the=
 sea from there!

Slowly many new sets of instructions involving horses, ch=
ariots etc were taught and many new paths to the sea were outlined instead =
of just instructing people to walk towards east [evolution of mantra/tantra=
/ yantras].

One particular path through jungles was dangerous [aghora and =
other dark tantric paths involving practice of sex, meat, wine etc]. Though=
 the distance to sea was much shorter through that jungle, it was just too =
dangerous and only the bravest and strongest could make it. There were crue=
l dacoits and wild animals [chance of a fall in a risky ritual] and many we=
ak people travelling to sea via that path were killed. A wise man who knew =
the entire territory well came forward, condemned that path and discouraged=
 people from trying that path. Since then, even people who were strong enou=
gh to successfully make it in that path desisted from it.

As time progress=
ed, people started fighting too much about whose path was superior. They we=
re foolish, not smart enough to adopt the original instructions, of either =
the so-called "pure" sea path or the so-called "new" path or other variatio=
ns, for the changed geography and changed times. Many followed the instruct=
ions blindly, hit roadblocks and did not reach sea. Many did not even know =
that "reaching the sea" was the actual goal of all their joirneys. They onl=
y thought they were supposed to follow the instructions faithfully and ther=
e was no need to adopt to the changed geographical territory and time. They=
 even condemned those who actually went to sea, came back and gave updated =
directions for their place and time, for violating tradition.

In case the =
analogy is not clear, here is a brief summary of its points. Veda is about =
realizing self. Vedic deities such as Agni, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Aswins, B=
rihaspati etc are slightly different aspects of Aatman. Veda describes vari=
ous aspects of the state of self-realization. That is why it is considered =
the highest knowledge. Other allied subjects throw some light on possible w=
ays to reach that state. While definitive and absolute statements can be ma=
de on the actual state of self-realization itself, no definitive statements=
 can be made on how to reach it. Only relative statements can be made based=
 on desa-kaala-paatra. The path depends on one's current position!

Great m=
en in many spiritual paths, within Hinduism as well as outside of it, came,=
 experienced that state, understood the current state of people around them=
 and gave specific instructions on how to reach that state from the current=
 state. Some followed the instructions and experienced the state. Some inst=
ead kept arguing about the contradictions between paths.

Stop Arguing and =
Do Sadhana

As the metaphor above illustrates, arguments about various path=
s are irrelevant and distracting. What is important is to pick a path and f=
ollow it. Whether one does a Vedic homam or an Aagamic homam is a secondary=
 issue. The primary issues are whether one does homam or not, how focused o=
ne is, how one=E2=80=99s focus is improving and how one is being transforme=
d internally.

Just as a twenty course meal eaten once every six months doe=
s not give much energy to one, a =E2=80=9Cbig=E2=80=9D homam or another rit=
ual done once every six months or a year does not boost one=E2=80=99s spiri=
tual or material pursuits. Just as a small bowl of rice and lentil soup eat=
en everyday gives more energy to one, a small 20-30 minute homam done every=
day gives a boost to one=E2=80=99s spiritual evolution.

Wise Tradeoffs

Su=
ppose the president of the country is visiting one for lunch with 100 assoc=
iates. One can invite all the 100 associates of the President by name and s=
eat them in the room individually, following various protocols. Then one ca=
n exchange long pleasantries with the President and then offer lunch.

Supp=
ose one is in a hurry and has very little time. If one still invites all th=
e 100 associates by name and seats them in the room individually following =
the protocol and does not have enough time to let the President eat lunch i=
n the end, is it a wise tradeoff? Or is it wiser to invite all the 100 asso=
ciates together and seat them together by violating the protocol and use th=
at time to let the President eat in peace?

Similarly, is it wise if one ex=
changes long pleasantries and gives very little time to eat? Or should one =
cut short on the pleasantries and give more time to eat?

In a fire ritual,=
 making offerings to the main deity is the primary part. Various upacharas =
done to the deity before the offerings commence is secondary. Various preli=
minary and final steps and offerings to associate deities are tertiary. If =
one has a few hours for the fire ritual, one can do everything given in scr=
iptures leisurely. If one has only 20-30 minutes, one needs to make wise tr=
adeoffs and maximize the benefit. It is far better than doing nothing.

<se=
ctions deleted>

Proof of the Pudding

At this time, more than hundred peop=
le are doing a homam to some deity or the other, everyday. Spending time wo=
rshipping god in fire for 20-30 min (or more) everyday, with an attitude of=
 surrender and with some basic intellectual understanding of the absolute t=
ruths expounded by Veda and Upanishads, can do a world of good to one=E2=80=
=99s spiritual evolution. The proof of the pudding is in eating it. One can=
 try to perform a short homam everyday for a few months and see for oneself=
 if there is a difference in one=E2=80=99s attitude, focus and clarity of t=
hinking.

<DI=
V><EM>"Mugging up of vedas" - mugging of vedas is not like mugging up an en=

arma like sandhya vandanam, brahma yajnam, samidadhanam (the homa performed=
 in the morning and evening by the student). It involves santha, anusantha =
and avrutis. The sadhana continues until brahma (mantra) becomes his power =
(varchas) and thereafter for the rest of the life time. I have come across =
a scholar whose fingers keep moving even in sleep in accordance with the ry=

t.</EM></DIV>
<DIV><EM> </EM></DIV>
<DIV>You see, the reason why I men=

howed some "vedic" priests who chant various mantra from the Vedas for hour=

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>I agree tha=
t chanting of the Vedas for hours on end is surely a sadhana. For that matt=
er, any focused attention given to any work becomes a sadhana in it's own r=

t do sadhana for spiritual realization and then and only then can one reall=
y claim to say what is truely Vedic and what is not. Sadhana for God realiz=
ation is the path, and when the realization dawns in sufficient degrees, on=
e maybe able to get a really clear perspective of what exactly the Vedas ta=
lk about. Not with energy flowing through Ida nadi, nor with energy flowing=
 through pingla nadi can one understand what the Vedas truely are. But with=
 energy flowing through the susumna nadi, there is hope! That is experienti=
al and a result of sadhana aimed at realizing the Self.</DIV>

<DIV>My view is that=

<DIV>True.=

 period. Infact, people (indologists) are not even sure of what consti=
tues the real Vedic age, so getting an accurate description is a far cry. <=
/DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Sri Ramakrishna and most of his disciples - wh=
o were all self-realized saints - would often comment that from the perspec=
tive of a sadhaka of God, these philosophies were never ment to be in contr=
adiction to one another but supplementary to each other. They explained in =
many of their writings how each of them (philosophies) had a place and=
 a stage and how each were essentially supportive of the different stages a=
nd paths leading one to the realization of the absolute non-differenti=
ated Brahman. I find this explanation more appealing and realistic.</DIV>
<=
DIV><EM></EM> </DIV>
<DIV>I was talking about the ones who composed th=
e Veda mantras. They were all knowing, and all knowledgebale seers. The Upa=
nishats and various emanating philosophies within the ambit of our Sanatana=
 Dharma, all undeniably trace their roots to the Vedas. That means, th=
e satha darshanas are not outside of the realm of the core Vedas. Therefore=
, the ones who composed the vedic hymns were both jyanis, vigyanis as well =
as performers of elaborate fire rituals, all combined together. There is no=
 conflict here. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Just like Vasistha says in th=

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Let me repeat the ques=

can you explain in a logical coherent manner, how exactly does these simple=

<DIV>Dear Shri.Rajarshi,</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>1."Thank you =
for the interesting example above. But I have a very pertinent question reg=
arding this.  And what exactly does it mean by saying one learned in t=
he Vedas? Can one, who has mugged up the Vedas and a few commentaries =
of the same, without experiencing any sort of self-realization, be called a=
 "srotriya"? Does such a non-realized being have "fire" in his right hand? =
Never! "</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>"Mugging up of vedas" - mugging of ve=
das is not like mugging up an engineering text book for the exam. It is a s=
adhana in itself. upto 12-13 hours aday of mantra chanting for 4 to 5 =
years coupled with one's nitya karma like sandhya vandanam, brahma yajnam, =
samidadhanam (the homa performed in the morning and evening by the student)=
. It involves santha, anusantha and avrutis. The sadhana continues until br=
ahma (mantra) becomes his power (varchas) and thereafter for the rest of th=
e life time. I have come across a scholar whose fingers keep moving even in=
 sleep in accordance with the rythm of the mantra. He has transformed himse=
lf into the mantra. The veda is installed inside him. This is no less than =
any sadhana we are speaking about.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>For this tr=
ansformed being learning bhashya is not necessary. He knows even beforehand=
 what is there in the bhashya and what it means in various planes.</DIV>
<D=
IV> </DIV>
<DIV>For information, Sayana's commentaries are based on th=
e nirukta (meaning of vedic terms) of Yaska. Nirukta is one of the vedangas=
. If we call Sayana's commentary a distortion, we will have to disown Yaska=
 as well.</DIV>

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Advaita ( or for =
that matter vedanta) is only one of the six darsanas (or ways of looking at=
 it). Dvaita, Vishitadvaita and Meemamsa have different views. By Vedic ris=
his do you mean the rishis who composed the veda mantras or the later =
ones also who philosphized on them. The views are not homogenous. The =
advaita vada is the most propagated one among the general public and has gr=
eat appeal . The other views also appear to be equally valid if you read th=
em. There were rishis who subscribed to the advaita vada, and others who di=
d not.  </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Yajno hi mantaeirdevatamuddi sya=

. This is another view.</DIV>
