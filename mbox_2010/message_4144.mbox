Devotee: =E2=80=9CA pure materialist does not believe in God. How =
are we to deal
with him?=E2=80=9D

Bhagavan: He will come gradually, step b=
y step, to find out the source of
=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. First, adversity wil=
l make him feel that there is a power beyond his
control, upsetting his pla=
ns. Then,he will begin with rituals, ceremonial
worship, and through japa, =
kirtan, dhyana, go on to vichara.

For we know nothing about God or any sou=
rce from which power comes and gets
into us. All that is not known. But =E2=
=80=98I exist=E2=80=99 is known beyond all dispute by
all men. So let us kn=
ow who that =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 is. If,after knowing it, there still
remain=
 any doubts such as are now raised, it will be time enough then to try
and =
clear such doubts.=E2=80=9D
