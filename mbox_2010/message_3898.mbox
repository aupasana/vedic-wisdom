Gopu ji , Rajarishi ji


Thanks for the clarifications and Yes I agree on v=
ested interests playing this rigged game to use any incident to target sana=
tana dharma as they have done in the past 800 yrs. They will question that =
Lord Krishna existed even after Professor U R rao of the ASI discovers the =
dwaraka ruins ...but will never question the truth that these so called ves=
ted interests speak.

On the path of sadhana we are taught to lessen identi=
fication with religion also...true but at times like these feel very much p=
ained that sanatana dharma is being attacked on so many sides systematicall=
y .

Anywaz it is all the divine mother's lila...When the country was ravag=
ed by tyrants like Aurangazeb she sent forth the great guru Samarth Ramadas=
 and his disciple Shivaji....
When the british were on a rampant ravaging s=
pree busy in creating brown babus who were attacking sanatana dharma by pro=
pagating false theories. ...she sent forth Ramakrishna and Vivekananda who =
brought back the faith , many people do not realize one of the benefits of =
Vivekananda was to stem the tide of erosion in faith and bring it back.


W=
e must continue our own sadhana as you said and leave the rest to the mothe=
r.

Regards
Vemparla Ram Kishore
