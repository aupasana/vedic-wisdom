namaste young person,

dharmehi prathamam pramANam vedaH. 

It is admirable=
 that you have respect for sri.narasimha. perhaps you have not understood y=
our guru - and as you say on his order you are leaving this group. This, I =
know is not his intent - And if it is some juvenile attempt on your part to=
 make me leave a vedic wisdom group it is a very sad attempt. There is no w=
ay, I can leave a vaidika group as I am vaidika brAhmaN. A vaidika brahmaN =
is protected by the vedah if he sticks to the vedaH and nothing but the ved=
aH. Lack of knowledge on anything as well the knowledge that he has is any =
big deal - 

His call to the Adi shakti in trikAla sandhya is (Ayatu varadA=
 devyakShram brahma saMhitam gAyatrIM ChandasAm mAtedam brahma jusasveme ..=
.yadannAt kurute pApam tadannat pRuti mucchyate.. ojoHsi sahoss, balamasi, =
... sarvamassi in times of trouble or happiness ... and finally brahmArpana=
mastu)  

I dont care too much for shaktas and tantras but they too are no =
big deal - if there is reason enough kids can learn it in a matter of a few=
 months. I have been riduculed by a person that quotes 12 years for Grammar=
 - I suggest he have a look at Whitney's Sanskrit Grammar or The Ashthadhya=
yi - translated into English - or Sir Monier Williams dictionary. and Gramm=
ar all published in 1800s. And they are masterpieces and truly tell me that=
 Sir Monier Williams or Whitney or Max Muller sat down cross legged and stu=
died Sanskrit Grammar for 12 years. And now whether you can tell that kid o=
f 8 or 18 you cannot do this - the next thing you know is the rascal create=
s a new computer language foxing University professors and probably even ha=
ck into the professor's computer and have a big chat with all his friends. =
Like what is happening with wiki leaks. I think it is high time to stop ask=
ing kids to grow up and grow up our own selves whether you are 60 or 90.

I=
 have been asked to shut up, an animal, and latest a worm in a rotting woun=
d by a person that has the most lovable name kRuShNa. In my lomg innings an=
d the long innings of Hinduism in Bharath - there is no new insult, that ca=
n be created that a brahmin or his fore fathers right upto RuShi have not h=
eard Nor is there any praise that he does not know. The four classes of ved=
a purohits were called by sri dasharatha for the ashwamedha yAga and after =
the yaj~ja, dasharatha handed over the the four quarters of his kingdom to =
the priests. What they said can be written in modern language " Oh Great Ki=
ng, you must be nuts! what on earth are we going to do with your kingdom - =
That is your dandhA and baby - run it yourself. namaste"

modern language, =
it can written  by birth or I can see through narasimha ji and he can me, I=
 think  - There is no power or shakti in the world that can throw a vaidika=
 brAhmaN out of any vaidika group for speaking about the veda and nothing b=
ut the veda.
