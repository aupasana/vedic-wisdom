I must mention a strange yet noble experience.
Daily morning I pray (briefl=
y) to Thakur Ramakrishna and Sarada ma and
Vivekanandaji amongst others but=
 did not have any picrures/photographs of
eitherThakur and Sarada ma.

I ke=
pt wishing for such a photograph on the wall of our home and one
day sudden=
ly in one of the local shops I was presented with a calendar (I
hadn't aske=
d for any), which had picture of the Thakur with Sarada ma
blessed by ma Ka=
li.

I was stunned and still think that it was a wish fulfilment by Thakur.=

Strange are His ways.
Neela
