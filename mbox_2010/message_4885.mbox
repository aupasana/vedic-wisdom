Well your reasoning is valid but i have strong reasons to believe that the =
statement was not result of corruption but shiva himself said so. . Secondl=
y i want to clarify that i am not saying saptashati is nothing for most peo=
ple it gives most things desired and what you said about it giving samadh a=
nd siddh are all true but my only point was kunjika goes a step further it =
is like a key to unlock saptashati :-)
