Namaskaram.
=C2=A0
I do daily homa and am=
 sharing here my method (which may not be wholly orthodox or correct, so ta=
ke it with lots of grains of salt) to make it feasible. I think my prep tim=
e takes less than 5 mins; the actual homa takes me 45 - 50 mins. I also do =
a separate sadhana that takes me 20 mins--so, all together, I spend 80-90 m=
ins in the morning doing homa and sadhana. These are the steps I follow for=
 the homa:
=C2=A0
I keep the copper kunda in an aluminum tray, which rests =
upon two bricks on the floor, and the two bricks are on top of a folded hea=
vy-duty black garbage bag. I don't fuss much about cleaning before and afte=
r each homa, because this arrangement protects the floor, so just on the we=
ekends, I clean it up properly by replacing / emptying the tray, and vacuum=
ing / wiping any residue. This havan "area" is fixed and I do not remove it=
 after each homa--it's like a fixed altar. 
=C2=A0
Next to the kunda area, =
I keep a small shrine where everything is laid out for the daily homa. Ther=
e is a small mandap for keeping the kalasha and vigrahas, and in front, I k=
eep a supply of the samagri needed for the puja (ghee, aarti tray with diya=
 and dhoop stand, kumkum, gandhan, agarbatti, etc.), oil for the diya, matc=
hes=C2=A0and a tray full of coconut halves. (I do not cut the coconut halve=
s into strips for the homa; I just use one coconut half per homa). This arr=
angement prevents having to=C2=A0gather and arrange=C2=A0everything from sc=
ratch each day.
=C2=A0
The main kalasha I only exchange the water once a we=
ek; during the week, I let=C2=A0the water=C2=A0accumulate the vrttis from t=
he successive homas.
=C2=A0
Accordingly, on any given day, all I have to do=
 to prepare for the homa is the following: Empty the burnt offerings from t=
he previous day's homa (which I offer to my plants outside as "fertilizer"-=
-they really thrive on it!), fill the pancha patra with water, and cut a fe=
w flowers for the homa offerings. I bring these back to the havan kund, fil=
l the lamp with oil and a wick, arrange the vigrhas for that day's homa (I =
do homa to different deities on different days), put the prasad in a little=
 offering bowl, and can sit directly for homa. So, this whole procedure tak=
es me less than 5 mins. 
=C2=A0
I do not bother with melting the ghee, even=
 though I live in cold climes in England. I have a 1/2 kg container of ghee=
, that I use each day, and I find that after using it once, it stays in mel=
ted / liquidish form (if homa is done at least every 2-3 days) and once I b=
ring the wooden spoon to the kund and heat up the ghee, and go back to scoo=
p some more ghee from the container, the heat from the spoon does the rest =
of the melting. (Again, maybe this is not kosher and is "wrong" from a madi=
 perspective, so please take with a grain of salt.)
=C2=A0
For prasad, I us=
e nuts, and I also use nuts for the bali, so I do not spend time preparing =
food or cutting fruit. 
=C2=A0
I have found this to be quite feasible to do=
 on a daily basis--that, too, while keeping a separate sadhana that takes a=
n additonal 20-30 mins in the morning and working a hectic 80+ hours / week=
 job, so it can definitely be done! Just try it for a few days and I think =
you'll be able to come up with your own routine.
=C2=A0
Again, I'm not at a=
ll advising to follow what I do (because my shortcuts may be wrong), but ju=
st wanted to share as a brainstorming idea.
=C2=A0
Warm regards,
Aditi

Hi Everyone, 

As I practise Homam mor=
e and more, I want to do it on a daily basis, but I want to know how to mak=
e it faster for a daily ritual. Yes there are short and supershort procedur=
es but what I notice is that I spend more time in preparing for Homam, than=
 the actual homam itself. Is it the same with everyone else? Arranging for =
Alumium Wrap around the homa kundam, and within the fire-place, and outside=
 of it, Melting the ghee, arranging for water, Akshatas, flowers, incense s=
ticks, camphor, oil lamp, wicks, firewood, dry coconuts, Havan Samagri, wat=
er, preparation of Kalasam etc., takes at least about 15 minutes prior to s=
tarting of the homam. Also, preparation of maha naivedyam (either ravva kes=
ari or sweet rice pudding [payasam]), which I normally do, takes another 20=
 minutes at the minimum. For these reasons, I am unable to do it other than=
 weekends. So, generally I end up doing a Ganapati homam on Sundays. Any id=
eas as to how to make it faster for a daily
 ganapati homam? Also I general=
ly make offerings with Gayatri Mantra in every homam, I want to know if the=
re is an exclusive Gayatri Homam with Gayatri being the main deity, with pr=
ana pratishtapana mantra etc., or can we just do the Gayatri Avahana (that =
we do in Sandhyavandanam) at the homam? The reason I ask this is, I sometim=
es do Purascharanas of Gayatri (currently doing one), usually about 24,000 =
over a period of 40 days and then offer 10% of the same in Homam. Those 2,4=
00 I make an offering into the fire without any exclusive prana pratishtapa=
na of Gayatri, but generally as part of Ganapati Homam itself, because I do=
n't know any other way to do this. Any advice?

Also as I understand Adi Sa=
nkaracharya has established six orders of religion (Ganapatyas, Koumararas,=
 Vaishnava, Shaiva, ShAktEya and Soura orders). I wonder if there is a homa=
m for Kumara Swamy. For the rest, there is one, if I am right, although I a=
m not sure if there is one exclusively for Lord Surya. I heard of Navagraha=
 homams though. 

Also Kumaraswamy is not part of Pachayatana pooja, which =
is also established by the Jagat Guru. Why?
