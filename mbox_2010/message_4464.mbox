 Atmananda was a young, accomplished Austrian musician whose interest in
Th=
eosophy first took her on a visit to India in 1925 at the age of
twenty-one=
. She later became an ardent follower of J. Krishnamurti and
returned to In=
dia in 1935 to teach at the Krishnamurti School near Benares.
By 1942 she b=
ecame despondent and left the school in search of a means to
assuage the in=
ner crisis that had engulfed her. This brought her to the
Maharshi from who=
m she sought clarity, peace and direction. From the
excerpts of her diary b=
elow it is apparent that during her six-week stay in
Tiruvannamalai she was=
 granted that, and more.

The diaries of Atmananda were edited by Ram Alexa=
nder and published by
Indica Books under the title "Death Must Die". The bo=
ok contains the
intimate story of a sincere seeker who ultimately finds her=
 way to peace and
security under the loving guidance of Anandamayi Ma. Atma=
nanda died in
Benares in 1985 and at her funeral was given the utmost honor=
 and respect
accorded a sanyasini of the highest order.

Ramanashram, Tiruv=
annamalai, 17 May 1942

I left Benares on the 10th May. As the train approa=
ched Tiruvannamalai, I
suddenly felt blissfully happy, thinking, 'Now all s=
truggle is over, there
will be only peace. The prodigal son has returned to=
 his father's house.'
After some time this passed.

31 May, 1942 - Question=
s for Ramana:

(1) If the mind seems utterly confused and muddled, what is =
the first step
in order to get clear?

(2) In one of the books of your dial=
ogues you say that such thoughts as "Is
this a good thing to do or is that"=
 should not be allowed. How can one live
and decide without such considerat=
ions?

(3) At times I am completely at peace and at other times all restles=
sness.
There seems no connection at all between these two conditions. Why i=
s that?

3 June, 1942

Answer to question No.2: "If you surrender to the Su=
preme Will, there will
be no question of decision or choice."

Question: Bu=
t I don't know the Supreme Will. I do not know to whom to
surrender. How do=
 I know the Supreme? I may deceive myself.

Answer: It is the mind that dec=
eives itself. At least you must admit that
you exist. Either you accept the=
 Supreme or at least enquire into the true
nature of your self. Who are you=
? Knowing or not knowing belongs to the mind
and therefore all your so call=
ed 'knowledge' is really ignorance. You
identify yourself with the mind and=
 that is the cause of the confusion. Enquire
more deeply into the true natu=
re of your individuality (i.e., Who is it that
possesses a mind?). In fact,=
 if you perceive that the mind does not exist at
all, then it will vanish a=
long with the confusion, and what truly is will
stand revealed. When you lo=
ok at your reflection in the water and believe it
to be an accurate represe=
ntation of yourself, then you are troubled when the
movement of the water d=
isturbs the reflection. But when you realize that
this has no reality to it=
, then your worries cease. You cannot get rid of
your shadow, but you need =
not believe that it is who you really are.

Question: I feel as if I were t=
wo and not one.

Answer: No, there is only the Self, there cannot be two. B=
ut if you focus
only on the form of the bangle, you may forget that it is m=
ade of gold. Yet
the form of the bangle is dependent on the gold. It cannot=
 exist without it
and ceases to exist when the gold is melted down; but the=
 gold itself
remains constant. By deluding yourself into identifying solely=
 with the
mind, you deny your true Self. This is worse than suicide, becaus=
e in
suicide you only kill the body; but here you are murdering the Self. S=
eek
the Self and the ego will vanish.

By solving one mind-created problem =
you only create new ones. When you cut
off one leaf, four new ones sprout o=
ut. Only by killing the root of the
tree, can you prevent the leaves from g=
rowing.

17 June 1942

Question: When I asked you how to solve the problems=
 of life, you said "Self
surrender." How can one surrender without danger u=
ntil Self realization has
been achieved, as the mind may create its own God=
 to surrender to? The most
cruel things in the world are done in the name o=
f God.

Maharshi: The mind and all of its creations come from the same sour=
ce.
Self-enquiry and Self-surrender are the same. As you proceed in Self-en=
quiry
you automatically surrender (as you become nearer to the Divine Sourc=
e).The
person that surrenders to a mind-created God will have to bear the
c=
onsequences of his actions and suffer for them. But even the thought of
God=
, however false, will take you to the Supreme Truth of the Self
ultimately.=
 The man who has realized, knows that the thought of a separate
God is utte=
rly false. But until then one cannot help it. When you are
totally still, y=
ou are the Self. When we think, we are forgetting God.
Self-enquiry leads b=
ack to Him (who is none other than the Self).

Question: Ultimately, but it=
 may take a long time!

Maharshi: There is no time. You may have it even no=
w.

Someone else's question: If the Self is one, why is it necessary to app=
roach
a Guru?

Maharshi: In reality it is not necessary, but because we are=
 dreaming on the
physical plane, the presence of the realized man is necess=
ary to wake us up
- to remind us of ourselves. When the proud elephant drea=
ms that a lion
comes, he gets a shock and wakes up suddenly. As we are all =
dreaming, the
help of the Guru, within this dream, is necessary in order to=
 force us to
wake up. The eyes of the Guru disperse the dream.

Question: T=
he physical eyes?

Maharshi: There are only 'eyes', not physical or otherwi=
se.

Miss Merston's question: From where does the 'resolve' come to start t=
he
Self-enquiry?

Maharshi: From the mind, like all other thoughts. But by =
having only one
single thought, this thought finally also gets absorbed. Yo=
u need not follow
your thoughts; the more you think the more thoughts there=
 will be. But
rather take each thought back to its source. That is surrende=
r and enquiry
at the same time.

Questioner: Why are you unable to refuse w=
hen others prevail on you for this
or that? Are you not free of karma and t=
herefore able to do as you like?

Maharshi: There are three types of karma:=

(1) Made by one's own actions and desires.
(2) Inevitable karma like Gover=
nment - world circumstances beyond your
personal control.
(3) The karma of =
others taken on himself by the man who is free of his own
karma.
Questioner=
: Is it like Christ, who suffers for the sins of others?

Maharshi: Yes. Th=
ere is no freedom, it [freedom] is merely a word (i.e.,
even Christ or the =
realised saint still must fulfill his destiny outwardly,
although inwardly =
he is fully liberated).

Questioner: Yesterday my old agony of restlessness=
 returned, and with it my
fear. I had back ache, head ache and tummy ache a=
nd utter misery. This in
turn made me resentful at feeling somewhat bound. =
But this morning I
suddenly got back my peace after deciding to talk to Bha=
gavan and to ask him
why I can't get rid of my egotistical resistance. As I=
 asked him the
question tears came. The answer was: "Take the resistance in=
to your heart
and keep it there."

>From the Ashtavakra Gita: "When the mind=
 is freed from such pairs of
opposites as 'this is done' and 'this is not d=
one' it becomes indifferent to
religious merit, worldly prosperity, desire =
for sensual enjoyment and for
liberation.

"The one who abhors sense object=
s avoids them, and one who covets them
becomes attached to them. But he who=
 does not accept or reject, is neither
unattached nor attached.

"He who ha=
s an egoistic feeling even towards liberation and considers even
the body a=
s his own is neither an jnani nor a yogi. He only suffers misery."
