Subject: Brazilian nuts for Homam
X-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=129982417; y=f4OClIIwAf0Xa-J9bCJaghvTpYd12H5QUnylMS3cCEJpoXbUkHIjQTw0Ag

Namaste Narasimha garu,  You mention different materials (woods/nuts) being=
 used for different purposes in homam.  What is your thought on using Brazi=
lian nuts in homam? I find it perfect for homam mainly for its high fat con=
tent.  It burns just like coconut producing no smoke and can be found in mo=
st grocery stores.  Also, can we use cardamom in homam? I assume it is a sa=
atvik substance unlike cinnamon.  
Thanks,
-Sunitha
