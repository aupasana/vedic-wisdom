Namaste Sriram,

[>Now, the pot already has akshats lying at the bottom, is=
 it fine to add sesame seeds as well to the same pit...]

Yes, please add t=
he BLACK sesame seeds in the same Pot and do not worry about presence of ak=
shatas in the pot.

[>is it OK to add more water to the pot (if same as ask=
ed in previous question) before start offering to Pitris?]

Yes. add the wa=
ter if required in the same Pot.

One more thing i wish to clarify, if wate=
r gets over in the middle of ritual, it is fine to getup and add water and =
continue the ritual.

To give a fresh instance...Y'day night i was using a =
small copper pot (which i do not use normally) for the Tarpana. the pot got=
 emptied just before tarpana to Yama. I got up and filled the pot and conti=
nued from the same point. One more time it got emptied in the middle of Pit=
ri tarpana. i agaIn got up and refilled the pot, recited AGAIN the verse "A=
aagachchhantu me pitaraH imam gruhanantu Jalaanjalim" and continued the rit=
ual.

Sometimes one need not worry about such small small things and apply =
ones own *spot logic*

having said that i suggest to use adequately Bigger =
Copper Pot for the ritualb so that rituals remains without any breaks.

And=
 Sesame seeds means Black Sesame seeds in this ritual because Balck sesame =
seeds signify blocking Karmas.

Best Regards,

Utpal

 For any spiritual sadhaka, eating as saattwik food as one can is always a =

one can stop eating meat or atleast cut down on it. Eat as simple and saatt=
