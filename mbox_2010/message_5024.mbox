Namaste,
 
(1) If a mantra already has swaahaa at the end, there is no need=
 to add another swaahaa in homam.
 
(2) Yes, one can do Gayatri homam using=
 Gayatri mantra. Homam can also be done with several mantras of Kartikeya. =
A simple pournaanika mantra that is quite powerful is Subrahmanyashtakam. H=
omam can done by offering 8 aahutis with 8 verses and repeating as many tim=
es as one wants. The simple shadakshari mantra (OM sharavaNa bhava) can use=
d or the corresponding naama mantra (OM sharavaNa bhavaaya namaH) can be us=
ed. Another variation is "OM shaM raM vaM NaM bhaM vaM sharavaNa bhavaaya n=
amaH".
 
(3) I have not seen the videos.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
