I agree with Dinesh. Only very advanced sadhakas will be able to identify
r=
nas / karmic debts and know how/where/why they are to be paid off. The rest=

of us have to follow dharma, which includes standing up for what is right
=
and righteous and not being defeatist or fatalistic. Otherwise, Arjuna coul=
d
have written off the wrongs of the Kauravas as a massive rnu, but of cour=
se,
Krishna urged him to take up the dharma of kshatriyahood and slay witho=
ut
mercy. The webs of karma are too intricate and complex and delicate to b=
e
comprehended unless one has reached certain very very high levels of
spir=
itual attainment, and even then, it will only be a partial vision. Only
S/H=
e who is unlimited (Iswara/i) knows and sees the entire web of karma and
kn=
ows best how to dispatch rnus as necessary.

I agree with Dinesh. Only very advanced sadhakas will be able to identify r=
nas / karmic debts=A0and know how/where/why they are to be paid off. The re=
st of us have to follow dharma, which includes standing up for what is righ=
t and righteous and not being defeatist or fatalistic. Otherwise, Arjuna co=
uld have written off the wrongs of the Kauravas as a massive rnu, but of co=
urse, Krishna urged him to take up the dharma of kshatriyahood and slay wit=
hout mercy. The webs of karma are too intricate and complex and delicate to=
 be comprehended unless one has reached certain very very high levels of sp=
iritual attainment, and even then, it will only be a partial vision. Only S=
/He who is unlimited (Iswara/i)=A0knows and sees the entire web of karma an=
d knows best how to dispatch rnus as necessary. =A0<br>

with disgust serves no purpose, for such a person's mind is dwelling on=
 the impermenant manifestation of Self ("feces") while eating it.=
 A successful Aghora may be eating feces, but the mind will not be dwelling=
 on the fact that he is eating "feces" with certain properties an=

d he is eating Self.<br>

n one's thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on the impermanant man=
ifestations of Self ("a tasty laddu", "a badly cooked brinja=

ocus on the permanent (Self).<br>

too bad. If the mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice) taste of a la=
