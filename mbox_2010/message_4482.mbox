 Marye Tonnaire is an ardent devotee who lives at Sri Ramanasramam, India.
=
For two years she worked with the translators of Smt.Kanakammal's Commentar=
y
on Arunachala Stuti Panchakam and Upadesa Nun Malai, a 700 page book. She=

moved closely with Smt.Kannakammal for a number of years.

When I read abo=
ut Kanakammal in Moments Remembered and then read her own
Cherished Memorie=
s, I was thrilled to discover the beauty of her
relationship with Sri Bhaga=
van and the depth of her understanding of Sri
Bhagavan's way. But still no =
direct contact occurred until several years
later when I was asked to bring=
 Kanakammal in the taxi with me to Chennai
where I was taking a flight back=
 to Europe. After leaving me at the airport,
the taxi would then take her t=
o her relatives' house in the city.

Sri Bhagavan brought us together a few=
 years ago when my friend Joelle, from
France, who had a very special rappo=
rt with Kanakammal, invited me to attend
classes that Amma was going to giv=
e on Sri Bhagavan's original works and
scriptural translations that make up=
 the Tamil Parayana we sing at 6:30 in
the evening. In the classes Kanakamm=
al would go through the commentary that
she had written in Tamil based on M=
uruganar's explanations to her.
Kanakammal had apparently held classes for =
Indian people in previous years
and now her class would be translated into =
English.

The first year, somehow, I didn't feel the motivation to attend r=
egular
classes in the morning.

When Joelle came back to Tiruvannamalai the=
 following year, I decided that
this time I would join the class. I soon re=
gretted that I hadn't started
earlier. We were a small, core group of ladie=
s - Aparna, Dolly, Punita and
Minakshi. Joelle and I were the only foreigne=
rs, though sometimes Rumi would
join us and also some other visitors. Kanak=
ammal would speak in Tamil, but
we had the blessing of Aparna's outstanding=
 English translation.

During that time I went almost daily into Kanakammal=
's compound, placed my
chappels out on the veranda under her window and had=
 my first glimpse of her
sitting in her chair perfectly groomed, draped in =
a starched, light colored
sari with an aura of deep contemplation surroundi=
ng her. She reminded me of
my grandmother in some ways. When I would peep i=
n through the window she
would see me, smile and say, "Vango, Vango" (Come,=
 Come). Then we would
greet and I would sit on the floor and lean against t=
he wall.

As she knew that I had undergone back surgery, she always insiste=
d that I
take and sit on the stool that she used to keep next to her chair.=
 As I took
my place I would look up at the photo of her as a young lady in =
her early
20s and think about how fortunate she was to in her early 20s and=
 think
about how fortunate she was to have come to Sri Bhagavan at that tim=
e.

Sometimes I would arrive late to class and once she started laughing an=
d
said, "She is Totakacharya." When I expressed my ignorance of who
Totakac=
harya was, I immediately got the story. Totaka was a devoted disciple
of Ad=
i Shankara, but the other disciples all looked down on him as being
quite d=
ull. Once when Adi Shankara waited for Totaka to arrive before he
would beg=
in his daily discourse, the other disciples became impatient and
complained=
 about having to wait for someone who didn't have the intellectual
capacity=
 to grasp the subtle points of the scriptures. When Totaka finally
arrived,=
 he was brimming over with bliss and dazzled the disciples by
uttering a fe=
w concise stanzas in Totaka metre that confirmed his complete
grasp of the =
subject matter.

This was our class: the commentary on Sri Bhagavan's works=
 was interwoven
with many colorful stories from various scriptures and pura=
nas, stories that
brought the saints and sages to life, right into that sma=
ll room. This was
interwoven with her own experience of Sri Bhagavan, Murug=
anar and other
senior devotees. At those times Bhagavan came alive and fill=
ed the room with
his Divine Presence.

Through her eyes, which were always =
fixed on the Master, she gave us a
precious glimpse of those golden days. I=
 was thrilled when she told us once,
with a twinkle in her eye, that someti=
mes it was stressful for her in those
days, particularly when the road was =
filled with water during the rainy
season and snakes would wind around her =
legs while she was walking to the
ashram, or when bandicoots and monkeys wo=
uld come into her house through the
openings and sometimes even make off wi=
th some clothing that had been left
to dry. But then all of the difficultie=
s she was experiencing would
immediately vanish as soon as she set foot int=
o the Old Hall and plunged
into Sri Bhagavan's graceful presence. Even thou=
gh most of these experiences
are recorded in Cherished Memories or have app=
eared in the Mountain Path,
her speech would flood the room with the divine=
 consciousness and bliss of
Sri Bhagavan, as if he were with us then and th=
ere, showering his grace.

Aparna's talent as a translator was such a boon =
for those of us who are not
proficient Tamil speakers.

Kanakammal used to =
delight at my attempts at communicating with her in
Tamil. She would speak =
very slowly as if I were a child, and then laugh.
Every time she would see =
me in the ashram she would take both my hands and
say "Eppadi Irukinga?" (H=
ow are you?) And I would reply, "Nallarukku (fine)
Eppadi Irukinga?" Then I=
 would sit down next to her in the back of Sri
Bhagavan's Samadhi Hall. Whe=
n she could no longer sit on the floor because
of leg pain, I would sit wit=
h her along with some other devotees in the New
Hall where a chair was plac=
ed for her use. At first she felt that she should
not sit on a chair in the=
 Samadhi Hall. Only later on she accepted to sit on
a chair in the Samadhi =
Hall.

She always pushed us inward to grasp the essence of our being, the A=
tman or
Self, or Summa irruku (Be still and know that 'I am'). She didn't w=
ant us to
complain about life's difficulties and problems. She said that li=
ke the dobi
(washer man) who beats out the stains on dirty cloth, the Prese=
nce of the
Guru drives away the individual self (ego) so that the Atman can=
 be released
and shine forth in all its glory. She firmly adhered to the fa=
ct that prayer
to Sri Bhagavan was the ultimate solution to any of our prob=
lems and
difficulties. She always insisted that the illusory individual can=
not do
anything on his own and only through complete surrender (saranagati)=
 to Sri
Bhagavan, our Sadguru, and with his grace can we do our sadhana.

K=
anakammal was very strict that we should follow Bhagavan's direct path, and=

once she took me to task about my tendency to be overly attracted to
ritua=
ls. She was rather strong about insisting that I had come here to do
Atma V=
ichara and that I should not deviate from the path. But at the same
time sh=
e never missed evening puja at the ashram unless she was ill, out of
Tiruva=
namalai, or there was a heavy downpour.

She liked to visit temples also. O=
nce she and I were part of a group that
went to Tirukoilur, and she was so =
enthusiastic, like a young girl, as we
visited the different temples there.=
 Another time she took me aside during
one Navarathri celebration in the as=
hram and said, "Come to my house
tomorrow morning, I want to make you a Suv=
asini in Sri Bhagavan's presence."
She had Revati, her niece, decorate me i=
n the traditional way and then gave
me a sari, blouse and bangles. I'll nev=
er forget that blessed morning
sitting in front of Sri Bhagavan's photograp=
h in her house. I was moved to
tears.

I feel privileged to have witnessed =
her passing and can just say that I had
touched her body at that time and f=
elt waves of bliss going through me that
pushed out any trace of sadness th=
at I could have felt. What a beautiful end
she had!

It was a testimony to =
her utter and supreme devotion to Sri Bhagavan. She
just walked into Sri Bh=
agavan's Samadhi on Jayanthi day before the puja
started with her eyes fixe=
d on the lingam and then dropped to the floor.
Some devotees immediately ca=
rried her outside near the meditation hall where
we sang "Arunachala Siva'"=
 Where she actually left the body is not
important.

Her last words to me t=
he night before in the Samadhi Hall were "Eppadi
irrukinga?" I replied, "Na=
larukku."

Then I asked, "Eppadi irrukinga?" and she said, "Nalarukku. I be=
lieve so.
Everything is good."
