Brahman: The Ultimate Reality of Sanatana Dharma

By Sri Dharma Pravartaka =
Acharya

"Brahman, as understood by the scriptures of Hinduism, as well as =
by the Acharyas of the Vedanta school, is a very specific conception of the=
 Absolute. This unique conception has not been replicated by any other reli=
gion on earth, and is exclusive to Sanatana Dharma. Thus to even call this =
conception of Brahman 'God' is, in a sense, somewhat imprecise. This is the=
 case because Brahman does not refer to the anthropomorphic concept of God =
of the Abrahamic religions. When we speak of Brahman, we are referring neit=
her to the 'old man in
the sky' concept, nor to the idea of the Absolute as=
 even capable of being vengeful, fearful or engaging in choosing a favorite=
 people from among His creatures. For that matter, Brahman is not a 'He' at=
 all, but rather transcends all empirically discernible categories, limitat=
ions and dualities...."
