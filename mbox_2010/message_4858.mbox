Namaste,
 
Yes, some people use bamboo tubes. Some people use the tubes in which incense sticks (dhoop or agarbatti sticks) are sold. Even with bamboo tubes, if air directly goes from mouth into fire, it can carry saliva. The key is that air blown from mouth should touch some surface (e.g. inside wall of bamboo tube) at an angle slightly less than 180 deg, get reflected and then go towards fire. Then, air touching fire will not have saliva in it. You can experiment by blowing air onto one palm by reflecting it off the other palm. You'll see that air coming to the latter is wet and the air coming to the former is dry. In any case, like I said, maintaining a good sized fire always is better than letting it nearly extinguish and then resuscitate it by blowing air.
 
Ideally, one should not leave in the middle and stay till the end. If one must leave the area for a nature's call, one can add enough wood (or other fuel) before the break.
 
After the nature's call, it is a good idea to take bath again. Some level of physical cleanliness is to be maintained with external fire. One cannot say "I am pure inside and why does external purity matter". Just as the internal fire is affected by internal purity, external fire is affected by external purity.
 
When the external fire is strong, the internal fire tries to follow it and resonate with it. So the rules of external fire must be obeyed. If a yogi with a very strong internal fire is doing homam, then actually the internal fire may dominate and the external fire may follow it and resonate with it! Then the rules of external fire do not apply.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

The agni used to cook food is also holy and some of the same rules apply.If you dont have a bamboo tube, then you can get it from one of the people who make and sell ladders and the like( if you are in India). Not to disparage others, but some of the priests themselves are ignorant of all the things which needs to be observed in a homa. As an example, for long homas one is allowed to drink water and milk in between- but no stimulants(coffee/tea being the most common).

>             Namaste! What do the sastras say about what we should do when we have to answer the call of nature during a homa ? For japa, the rules are clear to me- do the same rules apply for homa ? If for example we must get up and go for a 'long call' and hence have to take bath- the fire could go off- do we add more wood/cow dung/samit and go ?
