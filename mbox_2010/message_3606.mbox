Hello KK,

A Strange and Bad incident happened with me once about 11 months=
 back and i informed Narasimha about it. I reproduce it if it can help you:=


Following is my email to him:
[
About the strange incident:
  
Today afte=
r Purnaahuti Mantra, when i was about to offer/or just at the time of offer=
ing the Dry Halve coconut, one insect (a kind of butterfly i suppose with b=
ig wings) suddenly came and fell in the Homa agni. it got stuck under a bur=
ning coconut piece and couldn't come out even i couldn't do anything becaus=
e every thing happened in a flash, within span of 4/5 seconds. it pained me=
 and shocked me. The insect got burnt immediately as the fire was burning v=
ery bright. Fortunately i could not see that sight because it was under coc=
onut pieces.
>  
> i close my eyes and prayed Mahaganapati for Sadgati of t=
hat soul.
>  
> What is your feeling about this issue? Does the accidental =
sacrifice of the insect signify some Ashubh tatva? How should i take this? =
Or simply forget.
 
Narasimha replied me not to worry about the incident an=
d I forgot it completely. I just removed it from my mind.

***
I think you =
need not worry about the particular incident. Homam should make one very st=
rong and 'worry-less'. One should be compassionate but at the same time, ne=
ed not worry about such incidents on which one can not do anything. I sugge=
st you all pray for the souls of kittens during your prayer/Homam and forge=
t the incident.

Hope this helps.

Utpal
