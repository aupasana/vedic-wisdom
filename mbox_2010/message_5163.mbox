Namaste Nagaraj Garu and all other members,

I'll quote 3 verses from Bhaga=
vad Gita with which the whole Gita vertually comes to close. They are the l=
ast pearls of wisdom by Shri Krushna and highlights the supreme importance =
of Surrender:

SarvaGuhyatamam BhuyaH Shrunu me Paramam Vacham |
Ishtoasi m=
e Dridhmati tato vakshyami te hitam || 18-64

Manmana bahava Madbhakto Magh=
aji mam Namaskuru |
Maeivaishyasi Satyamte pratijane prayosime || 18-65

Sa=
rvadharmanParityajay Mamekam Sharanam Vraja |
Aham Tvaam Sarvapaapebhyo Mok=
shyishyaami Maa ShuchH || 18-65 


The above 3 verses really caught my atte=
ntion some 5 years ago and gave me immense satisfaction then. Now for me, t=
he mandabudhhi, Gita's essence are those 3 verses.

It does not need to inf=
orm all the learned people that Krishna means Any deity to whom one is atta=
ched with.

Best Regards,

Utpal

So essentially I am interpreting the verse in the following manner after al=

any length of time, one should not get carried away by the feeling of doer-=

PVR Garu, to come back to my senses.

 Bhagavadgita by Shri Vidyaprakashanandagiri in Telugu. The book is called =
"geeta makarandamu". In this wonderful book he not only gave meanings and i=
nterpretations of Geeta but he even gave specific ways practising several d=
eekshas with several slokas of Geeta and specific yantrams. Being a peethad=
hipati and excellent pravachana kartha, this great man did not include any =
cautionary statements about initiation or Upadesha on these practises. So, =
I am thinking of practising the same when the appropriate time comes, assum=
ing that initiation is not needed. If any seniors in this forum have gone t=
hrough this book or have more knowledge on the same, I will be happy if the=
y share their knowledge/opinions on the same.

 by their very resolve to worship Her, will soon attain the knowledge of th=

not stay away from worshipping Her because they have no knowledge or only l=
