As example if you go to ZOO look at lion, he is 22 hours sleeping and rest =
of two hours in senual pleasures like se. and food mostly. lion is concider=
ed "Rajsik" or "Tamsik". when lion is awake mostly you will see agression i=
n lion's eye. Vs. go to elephant it will be all mightful but calm, cool. As=
 per swami vivekananda this is food effect. Shastra ask you to control your=
 senses,subject,etc. When you have all senses in control you will look at k=
ing of senses which is "MANN" then "Budhdhi" then "Ahankar" and then Chitta=
 and then "Atma". unless senses are not in control this travel is also not =
possible. 
When Raja Janak got his "Sthit Pragya" stage he did not feel dif=
ference between fire or ice on his own palm.
