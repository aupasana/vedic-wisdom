Namaste:

I use dry-coconut and ghee mainly, and there is very minimum smok=
e.  I was
initially worried that doing Homom would turn on the smoke detect=
or.
 Nothing that sort happened.  There is odour (it's not a foul one) whic=
h I
like.  For me it creates a peaceful ambiance at my place, after the Hom=
am is
completed.

For mantras what I do is play the Homam video on my lapto=
p and put my
headset (connected via blue tooth to the laptop). I have the H=
omam procedure
print out on one of my lap.  So now I am reading the mantra =
and also
listening to it at the same time. You will get hang of it soon.  N=
ow after
doing it weekly for nearly five months, mantras are almost in my h=
ead and
also their intonation.

Getting a blue tooth headset has lots of ad=
vantages. I listen to
mantras/discourses while doing dishes, cooking etc.

Regards,
Hemanth

  (I would of course disconnect my fire alarm, it goes off when I am cookin=
