Any names of the books that you can sugg=

What you are describing seems =
to be a higher state of visual awareness of energies around of you.  Now us=
ually this state is achieved through some increased saadhana or spiritual p=
ractice but it can come involentarily as well, although that is a bit rare.=
  If you say that you are meditating less than before then just have a quic=
k eye check up done as well to rule out anything medical but from what you =
describe it does indicate higher visual awareness of energies.   <br>


<br=
>
A few points<br>
<br>
1. Usually darker colors such as Blue, Purple, Indi=
go, and Magenta are associated with higher forms of spirituality (VIBGYOR).=
  Clairvoyants claim to report deeper color auras around spiritual practiti=
oners although they also claim that a highly evolved spiritual person would=
 have a white or a light pink aura<br>


<br>
2. Colors could also associat=
ed with closeness to specific dieties that one mediates on.  For example on=
e meditating on the Devi might visualize red more in their meditation or sl=
eep where as on meditating on Rama may see more solar colors etc.  <br>


<=
br>
2. There is no universal standard of the interpretation of energy visua=
lization. As an example, one person may associate spirituality with blue wh=
ereas another "energy sensitive" may associate white.  There coul=
d be no relationship between the color you visualize and a particular chara=
cteristic as well.  If you are energy sensitive you will have to develop yo=
ur own understanding of what each color means and usually it takes time, pr=
actice, and greater spiritual saadhana.  <br>


<br>
3. I would recommend t=
hat you get a couple of books on auras and learn more about energies and co=
lors and they even have some exercises to develop this siddhi further. <br>=

<br>
4. Most importantly, as Narasimha says, don't get mesmerized by t=
he scenery along the way and lose sight of the destination.  If you are att=
aining a siddhi, knowingly or unknowingly, then use this to get closer to t=
he divine and ask him/her for guidance so that this may be used for the wel=
fare for which it is intended.  Surrender the fruits of any siddhi to the d=
ivine and don't let it get to your head.  <br>
