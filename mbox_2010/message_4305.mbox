Dear Friends,



At the outset, Let me introduce myself as a Chartered Acco=
untant in practice in Chennai, Tamilnadu for more than 30 years.
Recently I=
 have taken up the noble task of renovation of dilapidated Siva & Vishnu te=
mples.

For this purpose, a Trust has been instituted under the name of sty=
le of ARULMIGHU ABIRAMI PARIPALANA TRUST.As a first instance, I have taken =
up the renovation of ABIRAMI SAMETHA THIRU KAMESWARA SIVA TEMPLE at Kali Vi=
llage , near Mayiladuthurai in Tamilnadu.The Temple presently is in a ramsh=
ackle condition and requires immediate attention.

As we share the same ide=
ology and hail from the same community, I have taken the liberty of enclosi=
ng an appeal which contains the details of the aforesaid temple.I request y=
ou to kindly spare some of your valuable time in going through the appeal.I=
n case you feel that the cause taken up by me is worthy for help, I request=
 you to kindly circulate the appeal among your e group.


You may also view=
