 Sri Venkatarathnam lived with Bhagavan from 1944 to 1950. During the last
=
year he served as one of his personal attendants. Neal Rosner came to Sri
R=
amanasramam from the USA in 1968, attached himself to Venkatarathnam and
di=
ligently served him until his passing in 1976. Neal=C3=83 s immersion into =
the
spiritual heritage of India under the guidance of Venkatarathnam is
ela=
borately described in his book On the Road to Freedom: A Pilgrimage in
Indi=
a. He now resides at Amritanandamayi Ma's Kerala Ashram and is known as
Swa=
mi Paramatmananda. In the following article, details regarding the life
of =
Venkatarathnam have been extracted from a 25-page essay written about
Venka=
tarathnam by Neal Rosner. He presented this manuscript to us thirty
years a=
go at Sri Ramanasramam.

Wanderings and Company of Saints

DURING the subse=
quent ten years after Bhagavan's Mahasamadhi, Venkatarathnam
spent his time=
 going on pilgrimage, meeting with devotees, mahatmas and
saints, but alway=
s returning to Arunachalam and Bhagavan's s ashram. In 1956
Sri Venkatarath=
nam went to Kerala on foot and took a vow not to ask anyone
for food or wat=
er and to only accept whatever was given unasked. He also
chose not disclos=
e his identity as a disciple of the Maharshi to anyone
during his travels i=
n Kerala, and he did not carry money with him. He spent
about six months li=
ke this, depending entirely on God, in order to test how
deep his surrender=
 actually was.

Back in Sri Ramanasramam

In 1967 the Mahakumbabhishekam of=
 Sri Ramana Maharshi's Samadhi was
performed and Venkatarathnam was then re=
quested to serve in the Ashram. He
continued this service until September 1=
969.

Routine in the Ashram

At this time Sri Venkatarathnam was very busy =
with his daily routine which
was roughly as follows: 3:30 a.m. got up, swep=
t the room, went to the
latrine, etc.; 4:30 a.m., finished bath, sandhya (p=
uja), japa and cleaned
his altar; 5:15, went to Bhagavan's Samadhi, cleaned=
 and swept it, and then
arranged for the 6:15 puja. From 7 to 8:15 he perfo=
rmed his own Panchyatana
puja, 8:15 to 9:15 he did Samadhi puja and from 9:=
30 to 11:30 did japa and
studied the Srimad Bagavatam. Then he partook of f=
ood. From 12 to 2 p.m. he
rested or spent the time in visiting and meeting =
devotees. 2 to 4 p.m., he
wrote letters, etc; 4 p.m. bath; 4:30 to 6:30, Sa=
madhi Shrine work, Veda
Parayana and puja; 6:30 to 7 p.m., sandhya and japa=
; 7:30 was mealtime; and
8 to 11 p.m., miscellaneous activities or satsang;=
 11 p.m. sleep.

Frequently he would go on Giripradakshina during the night=
s after 8:30,
usually returning only the next morning, and then again start=
 the daily
routine without even resting.

In 1967, on May 14th he met with =
H. H. Sri Chandrashekharendra Saraswati
Swamiji, Jagadguru Sankaracharya of=
 Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham, for the third
time and received from him mantra d=
iksha of Siva Panchakshari mantra. He
also received a Hayagriva Salagram fr=
om His Holiness. After this he used to
daily repeat 2,000 - 3,000 Gayatri m=
antras and 5,000 - 10,000 Panchakshari
mantras. By the middle of 1969 he ha=
d done 14 lakhs [1.4 million] of the
Panchakshari mantra. In August 1969, h=
e decided to somehow complete the
minimum number of japa as recommended by =
His Holiness and proceed to
Hyderabad to perform the yearly sraddha of his =
parents. To do this he had to
sit for japa eight hours a day and after fina=
lly finishing it he had a
physical breakdown. After some days bedridden, he=
 left for Hyderabad in
October 1969.

Hospitalization

When I[Neal Rosner] =
came to Hyderabad to meet him, I[Neal Rosner] found him
in Osmania General =
Hospital with a fractured right hip. Riding as a
passenger on a scooter he =
was struck by a taxi. When I[Neal Rosner] asked
him how he had such an acci=
dent he said, "What accident? Is birth an
accident? Is there any such thing=
 as an accident for a bhakta? It is the
sweet will of the Lord, that is all=
."

The area around his hospital bed literally became an ashram, with photo=
s of
Sri Ramana and Arunachala, observance of occasional festivals like Ram=
ana
Jayanti and Karthik Deepotsavam. There seemed to be a continuous stream=
 of
devotees from 9:00 a.m. till midnight, or later. Usually in the nights
=
I[Neal Rosner] expected that I could get some rest, but at that hour the
at=
tending physician, who was a bhakta, used to come and enjoy the satsang
til=
l midnight or 1.00 a.m.

After four months he was discharged from the hospi=
tal and stayed at Malakpet
with Sri V. Srinivasan, who was the Inspector Ge=
neral of Prisons at that
time. He and his wife treated Sri Venakatarathnam =
with the fullest
hospitality and affection for more than two months. For th=
e rest of his life
he was grateful to them for the love and concern which t=
hey had showered on
him at that time. This was May 1970.

Pilgrimage to the=
 Himalayas

>From Hyderabad we traveled north with Swami Avadhutendra Sarasw=
ati and
eventually reached Nepal in August 1970. After Swamiji left us in K=
athmandu,
we flew to Pokhara and from there walked seventy miles into the H=
imalayas to
Muktinath, the Abode of Muktinarayana. This place is sometimes =
called
Salagrama Kshetra and is the 107th Dham on earth, Vaikuntha being th=
e
108th. This
walk was extremely difficult. We often got lost in the forest=
s and were
caught in darkness before we could reach the next village.

One =
night before reaching Muktinath, Sri Venkatarathnam suddenly got up and
was=
 loudly repeating Vishnu Sahasranam at about 1 a.m. In the morning he
told =
me that he had a vision of people with water pots on their heads, going
fro=
m a river to a temple which had a big Chakra in front of it. He had woke
to=
 the loud sound "Narayana, Narayana" ringing in his ears, as if someone
wer=
e shouting it in the room. It was then that he started doing the Vishnu
Sah=
asranam. He said that usually when he gets within a certain distance of
the=
 destination, he will have a dream about the deity of that place and the
na=
me Siva or Narayana will be ringing in his ears. When they finally reached
=
Muktinath, sure enough there was a big chakra in front of the temple as he
=
had seen in the vision.

Muruganar

In August 1973, Sri Muruganar, one of t=
he intimate sishyas of the Maharshi,
attained Siddhi in the Ashram. Venkata=
rathnam personally performed the
40-day puja at his samadhi and also the Ma=
ndalabhishekam. During all this
time he suffered from chest pain and weakne=
ss but nevertheless finished his
duty to a brother bhakta.
