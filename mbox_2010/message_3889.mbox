dear sri ram kishore,
I would like to add a few corrections in regards to o=
ur Chief minister
karunanidhi. He doesnt have communist ideology, he is a t=
hird rate
immoral character having 3 wives( first wife is no more) and he h=
ad
lot of concubines. Dayanidhi maran is karunanidhi's nephew and not
his b=
rother. If u recollect when Sun TV and its family newspaper was
attacked du=
ring 2008by karunanidhi's sun Alagiri(now union chemical
minister) three of=
 the employees of the newspaper died in that violent
attacks. All this happ=
ened because the newspaper reported that
people will prefer Stalin(karunani=
dhi's IInd son) rather than Alagiri.
This dayanidhi maran went on TV saying=
 that perpetrators of this 
violence will be dealt with strongly as per law=
. Over a period of time
patch work was done between the two families and no=
w the same
dayanidhi maran has withdrawn the cases filed against Alagiri an=
d
quietly forgotten the loss of three innocent employees lives.
Such people=
 cannot talk abt morality. Karunanidhi has ammassed wealth
thro corrupt dea=
ls and he is one of the richest family which u may not
see in communist par=
ty. He hates brahmins and he is an anti hindu.
=C2=A0
Coming to the sting o=
peration the whole thing can be a farce or doctored.
It is high time Sri Ni=
tyananda comes out and tells the truth behind this
episode. As a human he c=
an always denounce Brahmacharyam and get
into Grihasta life, but if such a =
desire is strong in his mind then he shud
announce and tell his followers t=
hat he is denouncing Brahmacharyam, but
yet he would be continuing his spir=
itual discourses and activity.
I only wish this sting operation is a false =
and it shud be a lesson to all
these media people who seem to sway the mind=
s of the people by
repeated broadcast of such perverted material.
=C2=A0
re=
gards,
k.gopu

=C2=A0 



Utpal=
 ji and Rajarshi ji

Vimalananda says in book1 Page 97 Chapter: Shiva

"Thi=
s is one of the many reasons I hate communism .Communists are taught to for=
get their parents ,culture to denounce them .If you destroy your parents an=
d culture which is your root how do you ever expect to prosper "

1.I agree=
 on Tehelka and Sun tv.Both are politically affliated entities with parties=
 hell bent on atheism which wait for a chance to use any occassion to denig=
rate sanatana dharma. I do not wish to deviate the discussion but interesti=
ng piece of tidbit.Sun tv which brought out the clip is owned by dayanidhi =
maran brother of Karunanidhi ( Supremo DMK which is a carbon copy of Commun=
ist ideology) and in today's speech he used the cover of this occasion to o=
nce again lash out at dharma.

The same Karunanidhi also lashed out at Kanc=
hi Peethadhipathi when the fiasco was ongoing. Hindu newspaper which is pra=
ised by normal people as unbiased was writing articles every day with so ca=
lled details of misgivings at the ashram....Sense a pattern ...That is the =
media war of modern India controlled by vested interests who would love to =
see an hindu sanyasi get insulted.Also stakeholders in this drama are the m=
issionary orgs.

2.In Nithyananda' s defense he never said he was god . He =
also never encouraged one to turn away from sex. His advice was very simple=
 ...when in the physical act keep it physical.As long as fantasies are not =
involved it does not become a addiction. 

He could very well be repaying a=
 rna ...or might be involved in a sexual ritual. 

Two of his gurus were an=
 old woman and a female tantrik which he mentions in his youtube video on d=
ivine consciousness and feminity.

3.Like Narasimha ji pointed out , he has=
 a very good way of explaining higher level truths.

What he did or did not=
 do is only his karma alone .This does not take away anything from his lect=
ures or messages.

and like Utpal ji rightly pointed out...When we are prep=
ared to sit on a high moral horse to judge others...we better be prepared w=
hen the divine mother tests us.By juding we will incurr a share of the karm=
a others committed and also will be judged quite harshly when our turn come=
s.

Regards
Vemparla Ram Kishore
