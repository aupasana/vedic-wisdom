 Introduction by Sri Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi

When Shankara, the Guru of t=
he world, was travelling in the western parts of
India and overcoming in de=
bate the expounders of the various schools of
thought, he once came to a vi=
llage known as Srivali. When a brahmin
inhabitant of the village named Prab=
hakara heard about his arrival he went
to him with his thirteen year old so=
n. He prostrated before Sankara and made
his son also prostrate. He then ex=
plained that the boy had been dumb from
his childhood, that he had no likes=
 and dislikes, nor a sense of honour and
dishonour, and that he was complet=
ely inactive. The Guru then raised the boy
up and asked him as follows in a=
 cheerful tone:

Text

1. `Who are you? Whose child are you? Whither are yo=
u bound? What is your
name? Whence have you come? Oh Child! I should like t=
o hear your reply to
these questions.' Thus spoke Sri Shankaracharya to the=
 boy, and Hastamalaka
replied as follows.

2. I am neither man, God, yaksha=
, brahmin, kshatriya,vaisya, sudra,
brahmachari, householder, forest-dwelle=
r, nor sannyasi; but I am pure
awareness alone.

3. Just as the sun causes =
all worldly movements, so do I -- the
ever-present, conscious Self -- cause=
 the mind to be active and the senses
to function. Again, just as the ether=
 is all-pervading, yet devoid of any
specific qualities, so am I free from =
all qualities.

4. I am the conscious Self, ever-present and associated wit=
h everything in
the same manner as heat is always associated with fire. I a=
m that eternal,
undifferentiated, unshaken Consciousness, on account of whi=
ch the insentient
mind and senses function, each in its own manner.

5. I a=
m that conscious Self of whom the ego is not independent as the image
in a =
mirror is not independent of the object reflected.


6. I am the unqualifie=
d, conscious Self, existing even after the extinction
of buddhi, just as th=
e object remains ever the same even after the removal
of the reflecting mir=
ror.

7. I am eternal Consciousness, dissociated from the mind and senses. =
I am
the mind of the mind, the eye of the eye, ear of the ear and so on. I =
am not
cognizable by the mind and senses.

8. I am the eternal, single, con=
scious Self, reflected in various
intellects, just as the sun is reflected =
on the surface of various sheets of
water.

9. I am the single, conscious S=
elf, illumining all intellects, just as the
sun simultaneously illumines al=
l eyes so that they perceive objects.

10. Only those eyes that are helped =
by the sun are capable of seeing
objects, not others. The source from which=
 the sun derives its power is
myself.

11. Just as the reflection of the su=
n on agitated waters seems to break up,
but remains perfect on a calm surfa=
ce, so also am I, the conscious Self,
unrecognizable in agitated intellects=
 though I clearly shine in those which
are calm.

12. Just as a fool thinks=
 that the sun is entirely lost when it is hidden by
dense clouds, so do peo=
ple think that the ever-free Self is bound.

13. Just as the ether is all-p=
ervading and unaffected by contact, so also
does the ever-conscious Self pe=
rvade everything without being affected in
anyway. I am that Self.

14. Jus=
t as a transparent crystal takes on the lines of its background, but
is in =
no way changed thereby, and just as the unchanging moon on being
reflected =
on undulating surfaces appears agitated, so is it with you, the
all-pervadi=
ng God.

15. As this stotra reveals the Self as clearly as the amalaka frui=
t placed
on the palm of the hand (hasta), it received the name Hastamalaka =
Strotra.
Moreover, the boy, eminent in jnana, came to be praised by all peo=
ple of
this world as Hastamalaka.

The father of the boy was speechless wit=
h wonder at those words. But the
Acharya said to him: `He has become your s=
on because of his incomplete
austerities. This is your good fortune. He wil=
l not be of any use to you in
this world. Let him stay with me.' He bade hi=
m go back and, taking the boy
with him, proceeded on his way. The disciples=
 then asked him: `How did this
boy attain the state of Brahman without hear=
ing, etc.?' The Guru replied:
`His mother left her two year old child in th=
e care of a great and highly
accomplished yogi who was practising austeriti=
es on the bank of the Yamuna
while she went to bathe in the river with some=
 women. The child toddled
towards the water and was drowned. Out of his com=
passion for the
disconsolate mother the sadhu forsook his body and entered =
that of the
child. That is why this boy has attained this high state.'
