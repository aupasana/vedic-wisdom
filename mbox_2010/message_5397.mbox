New Delhi: Dr
Subramanian Swamy is Pres=
ident of Janata Party. Well-educated and honest, he is
not only courageous,=
 but extremely blunt and forthright in his views.

Widely known for
publicl=
y challenging and fighting against prime ministers and chief ministers,
it =
would do well for his political opponents to remain on the right side of
Sw=
amy. For, his wrath can undo governments, leave alone individuals!

 

Thou=
gh his
histrionics have earned him the reputation of being a rabble-rouser,=
 no one can
claim to find anything incriminating against him to charge or d=
rag him to
court.

Speaking to Gulf
News in an exclusive interview, Swamy h=
as openly spelt out names on
the telecom spectrum scam accusing both politi=
cal and media persons for being
corrupt.

 

GULF NEWS: You
seem to be trea=
ding into familiar territory with 2G spectrum scam what with
earlier taking=
 the cudgels with Janata Dal leader Ramakrishna Hegde and All
India Anna Dr=
avida Munnetra Kazhagam leader Jayalalitha and several others? 

 

SUBRAMA=
NIAN SWAMY: This
is a very serious matter. The others were for a very diffe=
rent reason. Hegde
was a member of my party and crafted the impression that=
 he was a very honest
and upright man. But he was most crooked and did all =
kinds of rackets. And, of
course, he was tapping telephones of his own peop=
le, including his girlfriends!
A man who pretends morality had to be expose=
d. Strangely, in 1988, our own
party decided to investigate the incident of=
 telephone tapping and he supported
it thinking I wouldn't get to the botto=
m of it. When trapped, he filed a
defamation case against me and later with=
drew, which ended his career.

 

In the case of
Jayalalitha, I helped her =
win the elections and become the Chief Minister. I
was also instrumental in=
 providing her adequate security after the DMK (Dravida
Munnetra Kazhagam) =
government, which was close to the LTTE (Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam) =
was dismissed. But after winning, she began doing all the
rotten things tha=
t the DMK was doing. Whether she or her associates did, I
can't say. I ques=
tioned her and she got angry with me. In the process she started
letting lo=
ose violence against me. That's when I said to her, =91I'll teach you a
les=
son'. I dropped everything, sat in Tamil Nadu, and brought her down.

 

Is=
 it because of
bringing down governments that you are known as a troublemak=
er? 

 

That's not true.
There are also governments where I've helped. Lik=
e, the Narasimha Rao
government couldn't have survived but for me. I create=
d the Chandra Shekhar
government, which actually initiated the reforms even=
 though it didn't get the
credit because it did not last very long. I helpe=
d Rajiv Gandhi survive in his
worst days when everybody abandoned him.

 

=
Just because they
[the politicians] can't say I'm corrupt or illiterate, th=
ey spread this usual
propaganda that I'm a troublemaker. The public doesn't=
 think so. Else I
wouldn't have been elected to Parliament five times.

 

=
But haven't you
kind of dragged Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to court =97 =
something that was
till now unheard of?

 

Yes, but I also
saved him becau=
se I thought the press was getting out of control and
over-drawing the pict=
ure. I said that he sat on my petition to permit me to
prosecute telecommun=
ications minister Andimuthu Raja. Now, for the first time
in the history of=
 India the Supreme Court has directed the PM to file an
affidavit. This aff=
idavit shows that every letter of mine was marked by him for
action, but hi=
s officials told him he didn't have to. He didn't know the law
and I don't =
expect him to. But since Raja was forced to resign by him, I didn't
want an=
y more sanctions and said the PM didn't need to resign. Now they
[Congress =
persons] were wild, because they wanted to shoot him with their guns
on my =
shoulder.

 

Who do you mean by
=91they'?

 

Congress President
Sonia Gan=
dhi. She wants someone more pliable than Singh. He's pliable enough,
but ob=
viously, she is not satisfied.

 

And who do you
think could be considered=
 more pliable?

 

Defence Minister
A.K. Antony, if she can't bring in her =
son Rahul Gandhi.

 

Are you getting to
all this because your party is now=
here in the picture and you wish to remain in
limelight?

 

First of all,
=
whether I'm doing it for this or that reason, the question is am I speaking=
 the
truth. Is there corruption or not? It doesn't matter what my motivatio=
n is.
These are cheap diversionary tactics, which I don't take seriously.

=
 

Why has it taken
two years for the 2G spectrum scam to come to light?

 =


That's because it
took me more than one-and-a-half years to get hold of t=
he documents, which was
not easy. I had written to the PM in 2008 and he to=
ok two years.

 

On what basis do
you say that it could possibly
be the ca=
se of the most monumental corruption in world history?

 

Look at the shee=
r
size of the amount of Rs1.76 trillion (Dh142 billion) the nation has lost=
. And
I'm not talking about the bribe, which itself is pretty big. The tota=
l loss,
had there been an auction, and what actually it was sold for (Rs100=
 billion),
is huge. The bribe is a thing that out of the gain these people =
have
potentially made and will make over the years. My estimate is Rs600 bi=
llion of
bribe involved.

 

Do you suspect the
roles of some journalists a=
nd editors including Hindustan Times columnist Vir
Sanghvi and NDTV's Barkh=
a Dutt in this scam?

 

Most people are
relying on corporate lobbyist Nira=
 Radia tapes. But I know from personal
experience that journalists do a lot=
 of hack jobs. If wanted, they character
assassinate you at the behest of t=
he ruling party. In my case, the media
cannot say anything except that I'm =
a troublemaker, which doesn't sell very
well. They don't publish anything I=
 say unless it becomes impossible like now,
because the telecom scam has be=
come a big issue. They've been doing it
systematically. When elections take=
 place, many journalists come and ask
for money, saying they'll give favour=
able coverage in return.

 

In the case of Vir
Sanghvi, I know he used to =
visit Phuket [in Thailand] almost every weekend and
the Tamil Tigers used t=
o finance his trips. Because of his lifestyle, I knew he
was amenable and a=
 real fixer. He's been writing articles depending on who's in
power. As for=
 Barkha Dutt, she's been indiscreet and doing foolish things.

 

You're qu=
oted as
saying that though the PM is honest, others are not. Who are these =
persons?

 

Yes, he is honest,
but officials around him like his Principal=
 Secretary T.K.A. Nair and Cabinet
Secretary Pulok Chatterjee are not with =
him. They are all Sonia's appointees.
Even if you ask for the PM's appointm=
ent, her people decide who can and cannot
see him.

 

You've also said
tha=
t if the PM resigns, it will strengthen those who made money. Could you nam=
e
them?

 

Sonia and DMK party
chief M Karunanidhi.

 

You mean Raja is
j=
ust a face and the real culprits are the biggies of the DMK?

 

Raja got 1=
0 per
cent, Karunanidhi 30 per cent and Sonia's two sisters have got 60 per=
 cent of
the loot.

 

Have you done
in-depth research and investigation to=
 make such claims?

 

Yes, I've enormous
access because whatever my enemie=
s may say, one thing is there that I've never
betrayed anybody. Today, peop=
le in the government are so fed up seeing
everything happening in close ran=
ge and all this material is available
with the PM.

 

Why is the UPA - 2
s=
eeing so many scams?

 

Earlier, the scams
were related to the defence dea=
ls, where things were difficult. Now, they have
got into things within the =
country. And since there are lots of players, some
of them spill the beans.=


 

You think the
recent Mumbai's Adarsh housing and 2 G spectrum scams co=
uld be inter-related?

 

Yes, looks like it.
Lots of loans have been given=
, which obviously have been used

.

How soon do you
think all this will co=
me out?

 

Raja getting an
arrest warrant will happen soon and cancellatio=
n of the licences given so far
could happen within the next 2-3 months. As =
far as the recovery of the money is
concerned, of which there is a big dema=
nd in the country, that will take time.

 

However, if the
Americans, who =
know it all, co-operate, we can get it because there is the UN
agreement on=
 money laundering.

 

Do you think the
Congress will ask the Americans?

 =


No, they won't. But
I can force them to. It's only a matter of time. They=
 know what I can do
in court. They can't buy my lawyers, because I don't ke=
ep any! I
argue cases myself.

 

Why is the Congress
so adamant about not =
having a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into
the 2 G scam?

 

T=
hat's because the
JPC will be free for all. And they know that I will start=
 advising the MPs
what questions to ask.

 

One of the
questions is about =
her [Sonia's] sisters having got the money. And if the JPC
calls for the in=
telligence people, they will have to question her because the
data is now w=
ith them.
