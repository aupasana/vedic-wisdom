Dear Nagraj,

>From my little understanding : "Yagna" is a much more broader=
 concept than just doing homam.

What Krishna essentially means is that jus=
t don't say "idam na mamah", you need to act that way too i.e. you need to =
keep giving back to the nature. 

Thanks
Manish

      Dear everyone, 



I have just real=
ized that geeta in the chapter karma yoga, constantly talks about yagna (ho=
ma?) as the main activity and also asserts that whoever is not doing homa i=
s just adding his karma all the time. 



For instance, 3.9 states that 


=

"yagnyaarthaat karmanonyatra lokoyam karmabandhanah

 tadartham karma kaun=
teya mukasangah samachara"



which roughly translates to "karmas other tha=
n those for yagna (homa) are only going to increase the bondage and hence y=
ou should only that karma that is meant for yagna".



Now this in arjuna's=
 case means that he should just do the war, as that is his yagna! 



In my=
 case, does that mean that I should leave my job as a software engineer and=
 keep doing homas, and chanting vedam as that is my vihita karma as I am a =
brahmin by birth? 



Verse 13 also goes to say that I am only eating sin i=
f I am doing something outside of vedam to get my bread, which I am clearly=
 doing by working as an IT professional in the USA! Does this mean that we =
should all leave what we are doing and go back to our native places and kee=
p doing our kula vritti as defined by our vihita karmas as defined by our s=
criptures? I am very confused and need PVRjis help to understand this bette=
r. 



Nagraj
