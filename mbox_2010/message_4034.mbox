Namaskarams Narasimhaji and other Masters ,
I finished my "first" Chandi Ho=
mam yesterday and I should say that it was an overwhelming exprience. I int=
ended to do the 13 chapters end to end but had to restrict my self to the 1=
st,4th,5th and the 11th Chapters primarly because the homam was generating =
lot of smoke and I had a few occassions in the past where there were compla=
ins raised by neighbours regarding the smoke. I used different 5 different =
kinds of fruits along with flattened rice, puffed rice , raisins and dried =
cocunuts. Next time onwards I plan to stick to only dried cocunuts and a fe=
w other dry items so that the smoke can be restricted. 
While meditating I =
saw flashes of violet colour and I kept seeing the images of the devi's fac=
e (a rather serious one at that ) constantly munching on something. The ver=
y thought that Chandi was in the fire in the homa kundam gave me goose pimp=
les all over and I was thinking again and again whether I am doing enough t=
o give my best to her. In the end I felt as if the divine mother was consol=
ing me telling that its OK not to be 100% perfect but atleast you tried. Wi=
th the Ganapathi Homam I feel as if Ganesha is someone who plays around wit=
h you just like a child and so do you with him. But with Chandi I felt as i=
f I was talking to someone very mature and I felt like a complete idiot not=
 knowing what to do next and stumbling at every step.
Not sure whether this=
 is how everyone else feels as well. I would like to know the feelings of t=
he other masters in this group regarding their first Chandi homam experienc=
e.

Thanks and Regards,
Girish Sundaram
