Namaste Sri Shanmukha Sivacharyar,

A year consists of months and a month c=
onsist of days. If one uses years, months and days *consistently*, all year=
s should start with a particular month and end with particular month and al=
l months should start with a particular day and end with a particular day.
=

But that is broken if one mixes tithis (lunar days or rather soli-lunar da=
ys) with months of souramaana. One month may start on Sukla Ashtami and ano=
ther month on Sukla Chaturthi. How logical is that?

*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *



Even=
 the chaandramana calculations we follow today may be imperfect.

For examp=
le, ask a simple question: Why were the twelve months named that way?

Chai=
tra month starts when Moon and Sun are together in Meena (Poorvabhadra 4th =
pada, Uttarabhadra, Revati). Why is it named Chaitra? Vaisakha month starts=
 when Moon and Sun are together in Mesha (Aswini, Bharani, Krittika 1st pad=
a). Why is it named Vaisakha? Jyeshtha month starts when Moon and Sun are t=
ogether in Vrishabha (Krittika 2nd, 3rd and 4th padas, Rohini, Mrigasira 1s=
t and 2nd padas). Why is it named Jyeshtha?

If you look carefully, the nam=
es of the months are based on stars (Chita-Chaitra, Visakha-Vaisakha, Jyesh=
tha-Jyeshtha etc). Starting from Chitra, 12 out of 27 stars are picked for =
the names of months. At the time of Full Moon in Chaitra month, Moon moves =
by 180 degrees compared to where he was at the beginning of the month (Meen=
a) and is around Chitra star. At the time of Full Moon in Vaisakha month, M=
oon moves by 180 degrees compared to where he was at the beginning of the m=
onth (Mesha) and is around Visakha star. And so on.

It is logical to guess=
 that the zodiac was divided into 12 equal parts (not necessarily aligned t=
o the twelve rasis) and the name of a month is decided based on the star oc=
cupied by Moon at the middle of the month, i.e. at the time of Full Moon. A=
 prominent star was chosen in the twelve equal parts and the month was name=
d based on it.

*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

Mooladhara chakra is in the middle of the=
 body and it is the basis of our existence. The chakras at the top of the h=
ead or the bottom of the feet are not taken as the base. In astrology, zodi=
ac is decided by the Chitra star, i.e. Chitra star is perfectly aligned to =
the *middle* of the zodiac. We do not fix the beginning of the zodiac by th=
e exact location of Aswini star, but by taking 180 degrees from the exact l=
ocation of Chitra star. Similarly, it is possible that a month is named bas=
ed on the star occupied at the *middle* of the month rather than the beginn=
ing.

*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

When the current month started as per soli-lunar (cha=
andramaana) calendar on January 15, Sun and Moon were in Capricorn. So it i=
s called "Maagha maasa" based on current conventions.

However, Pournima of=
 that month is running right now and Moon is in the 2nd pada of Pushya star=
 right now. He is far from Magha star. Is this really Maagha Pournima as pe=
ople think?

My personal view is that it is Pushya Pournima right now and F=
eb 11 is Pushya Krishna Chaturdasi and not MahaaShivaraatri.

When a new mo=
nth as per Chaandramaana starts on February 13, people consider it as Phalg=
una maasa because Moon and Sun are in Kumbha. But the next Pournima on Febr=
uary 28 coincides with Magha nakshatra. I suggest that THAT is the real Maa=
gha Pournima. So March 13 is the Maagha Krishna Chaturdasi, i.e. MahaaShiva=
raatri.

*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

Bottomline: I agree with the conclusion of sourama=
ana proponents this particular time, but for a different reason compared to=
 theirs. I respectfully suggest that we are all lacking in our understandin=
g of the correct calendar used with tithi based festivals. We celebrate fes=
tivals on the correct days most of the times, but make mistakes now and the=
n. Some misunderstandings still need to be corrected.

Good thing is that t=
he knowledge of rishis is self-revealing and self-correcting. If one is sin=
cere and applies oneself, one can find the answers.

Best regards,
Narasimh=

It is probably best to go by =

Can someon=

With best wishes,

ions.<br><br>However, Pournima of that month is running right now and Moon =
is in the 2nd pada of Pushya star right now. He is far from Magha star. Is =
this really Maagha Pournima as people think?<br><br>My personal view is tha=
t it is Pushya Pournima right now and Feb 11 is Pushya Krishna Chaturdasi a=
nd not MahaaShivaraatri.<br><br>When a new month as per Chaandramaana start=
s on February 13, people consider it as Phalguna maasa because Moon and Sun=
 are in Kumbha. But the
 next Pournima on February 28 coincides with Magha =
nakshatra. I suggest that THAT is the real Maagha Pournima. So March 13 is =
the Maagha Krishna Chaturdasi, i.e. MahaaShivaraatri.<br><br>*  &=

<br><br>Bottomline: I agree with the conclusion of souramaana proponents th=
is particular time, but for a different reason compared to theirs. I respec=
tfully suggest that we are all lacking in our understanding of the correct =
calendar used with tithi based festivals. We celebrate festivals on the cor=
rect days most of the times, but make mistakes now and then. Some misunders=
tandings still need to be corrected.<br><br>Good thing is that the knowledg=
e of rishis is self-revealing and self-correcting. If one is sincere and ap=
plies oneself, one can find the answers.<br><br>Best regards,<br>Narasimha<=

Most =
smaarta-s observe this based on puraaNa-s. There the definition it is obser=
ved on the day which chaandramaana maaga maasa krishNa paxa chaturdashi occ=
urs at the nishita kala. This is how it is dealt with in books such as vaid=
yanAtha dixitiiyam. Based on this, the date in the US is Feb 11th and in In=
dia on Feb 12th.<br>
<br>
It is probably best to go by puraaNa or aagaama y=
