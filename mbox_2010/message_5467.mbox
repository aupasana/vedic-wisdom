Namaste

I am sure Narasimha Ji will look at your questions and answer them=
 much more clearly. My mail is only a attempt to show you another perspecti=
ve...Please Please Please do not get offended by anything that I write , ho=
pefully it only gives you some peace and Please do not contemplate thoughts=
 of committing the sin of suicide,it is the greatest folly .

I humbly beg =
for forgiveness beforehand .I am not attempting to judge the level of pain =
you have undergo nor claim that there is a easy way around it. 

Coming to =
the questions

Q." Isn't "Ishwar Paridhaan" i.e. "Ishwar yat karoti shobhan=
am karoti" same as stockholm syndrome? "

Ishwar Pranidhaan is not the same=
 as Stockholm syndrome.Modern psychology as propounded by Carl Jung and Fre=
ud only could use diseased minds as case studies unlike the lofty mantra dr=
ashtas of the vedas . In Stockholm syndrome the victim sympathizes with the=
 person perpetuating the crime and defends every action of the abuser.

Sub=
mitting everything to the almighty and doing whatever one can do maximum in=
 the given bounds of the karmic situation is not the same as submitting one=
self to abuse.

Second you are equating god with Abuser . Please refer to t=
his verse of the Bhagavad Gita

Gita Chapter 5 Verse 15

nadatte kasyacit p=
apam
na caiva sukrtam vibhuh
ajnanenavrtam jnanam
tena muhyanti jantavah

S=
YNONYMS
na--never; adatte--accepts; kasyacit--anyone's; papam--sin; na--nor=
; ca--also; eva--certainly; su-krtam--pious activities; vibhuh--the Supreme=
 Lord; ajnanena--by ignorance; avrtam--covered; jnanam--knowledge; tena--by=
 that; muhyanti--are bewildered; jantavah--the living entities.

TRANSLATIO=
N
Nor does the Supreme Spirit assume anyone's sinful or pious activities. E=
mbodied beings, however, are bewildered because of the ignorance which cove=
rs their real knowledge. 


God does not cause one to do bad karma nor does=
 he cause one to do good karma. He neither punishes nor rewards.In other pl=
aces as well Lord Krishna says the same thing.

The current situation you a=
re facing is not because of God.It is entirely because of the karma done by=
 oneself in the past life. God is not the perpetuator here period. 


Q2 Mo=
st people with good conduct I see these days are suffering and those who ha=
ppily claim themselves to be atheists, lead a prosperous life. Where is the=
 supreme power's role in this. I know materialism is a different issue, but=
 last year made me realize that materialistic troubles made me very weak sp=
iritually too. So, I dont see them to be connected somehow.


Unfortunately=
 there is a time lapse between action and fruit of action.If a seed is sown=
 today can you expect to eat the fruits tomorrow, just as an tree grows up =
in the natural order of time...there is a natural sequence in which karmas =
take fruit. The atheists you see today are wasting a golden opportunity of =
 utilizing this human life when the external situation is conducive to thei=
r growth. The good people suffering today are doing so due to their past ka=
rmas.

The pandavas themselves had to suffer even though they had Lord Kris=
hna right beside them.

Harishchandra had to sell his wife and children to =
survive...what to say of us normal mortals.


Healing begins with the first=
 step of realizing one is undergoing the fruits of one's own actions. It is=
 not the Navagrahas...it is not Krishna who is punishing us. The Navagrahas=
 act as mere mirrors of karmic energy to seize control of us at the right m=
oment to administer the fruits of our actions. They are blameless.


Please=
 take the attitude of Kunti , Draupadi, Harischandra, Ranti Deva and many o=
ther saints who had to suffer immense poverty and physical pain as inspirat=
ion.

Surdas the great poet saint was born blind and in extremely trying fa=
mily setup. Did he not blissfully sing of his love for Krishna.


Suicide i=
s the greatest sin ...it is not the route of courageous men.It is the route=
 of cowards who want to postpone the payments of their karma and this will =
force one who has committed suicide to take the body of a preta and hang wi=
thout salvation torn by desires.Desires in the human body are sufficiently =
vexing...think if one were submerged head down in water and were gasping fo=
r breath ...that is how intense the suffering of a preta really is.Each sec=
ond the preta suffers from hunger , lust , anger and so on and does not eve=
n have an body to express it....

Dear sir please do not even contemplate t=
hat thought.


May god give you the fortitude to tide over your troubles.

=

Regards
Vemparla Ram Kishore
