In Pushkar frequently there was strife between Hindus and Muslims. Many
Hin=
du pilgrims came to Pushkar, which is called the "Guru of pilgrims."
It has=
 the only Brahma Temple in the world. A famous Muslim shrine
called "Dargah=
" in Ajmer is just some kilometres away, therefore the two
groups can hardl=
y help coming into close contact. In those times when
they are most ardentl=
y pious, religious altercations naturally arise.

Mahaprabhuji was in Pushk=
ar on one such occasion and the quarrelling
parties sensibly decided to ask=
 him to mediate, for he was well known in
the city and respected by Muslim =
and Hindu alike. They presented their
differing points of view in a noisy a=
rgument, but raising his hand for
silence, Mahaprabhuji admonished them.

"=
Brothers, what turbulence you have brought here! Your quarrel is
senseless.=
 You labour under a grave mistake if you think you are
enemies, just becaus=
e you follow different religions. You must learn
instead to love one anothe=
r like brothers, for we are all children of
the One, Divine Father. God dwe=
lls in the heart of all living beings
whether Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Jain=
, Christian or Jew. If you truly
practise your faith, you will come to God =
by either route."

Mahaprabhuji then sang to them:



SUNJO HINDU OR MUSHAL=
A RE

Listen, Hindus and Muslims!

There is no liberation in fighting,

Nei=
ther side can ever win so.

The Hindus have forgotten Rama

And the Muslims=
 have lost Allah,

And both have strayed from the path,

HE is Rama, HE is =
Divine,

HE is Allah as well,

Thus spoke the Saints, but the people will n=
ot understand,

They would rather run about and shout.

May the Muslim hurr=
y on his way to Mecca,

May the Hindu spring into the Ganges for his holy b=
ath,

May the Pandit study his books

And the Kaji[1] ponder the Koran =97
=

Without knowledge all their doing is foolish.

Only the self-realized One,=


The Muslim as well as the Hindu,

Can see Oneness in the manifold,

Pleas=
e, real seeker, take my point,

It heralds from the infinite Omnipresence.
=



The poetical expression of this bhajan may only be appreciated in the
or=
iginal Hindi language. It deeply penetrated the hearts of the
quarrelling p=
ilgrims, as the realization of their unity in God
reconciled them.

Mahapra=
bhuji seldom visited a temple. Asked why he did not worship in
temples, he =
answered, "Statues, pictures, churches, mosques and temples
only serve as o=
bjects of inspiration. In reality God is within you. Your
body is the true =
temple of Divine love. The houses of God are kept as
symbols so that these =
inner realities are not forgotten, but they are
not meant to be confused wi=
th reality."



MERA DEVARA ME DEVA BAHAR NAHI BHATKUN

My inner temple is =
the dwelling of the Lord,

I will not wander out,

The Divine is within me =
and I accept no illusions.

He is neither in Kashi[2] nor Mathura, he is in=
 my heart,

Only the wise know this, not the ignorant,

He is neither in Pr=
iyag nor in Haridwar,

Without knowledge, all is fruitless,

Bathing in the=
 Ganges does not bring liberation,

I know my inner Self, neither Karma nor=
 destiny

can affect me,

Broken is the veil of illusion.

My Satguru has a=
wakened the Swan of my Soul and freed it,

He peeled away the last inner la=
yer,

Swami Deep says: my Revered Guru,

Bhagwan Sri Devpuriji

Revealed to=
 me the Divine Self,

There I found my realization and inner peace.



"Mah=
aprabhuji, you yourself are the temple and place of pilgrimage,"
they ackno=
wledged. "Your presence has removed our ignorance."

Thereupon Mahaprabhuji=
 asked them, "Why do you travel to temples to
experience God? God is foreve=
r within you. Listen."

He sang another bhajan:



TERA DEVARA ME DEVA BAHA=
R MATA DOLE

God dwells within your own temple,

Do not wander outside,

Th=
e mountain is concealed within a single mustard-seed.

God is Omnipresent, =
like fire in wood and oil in sesame,

The Satguru reveals reality. Follow h=
is words.

Like the musk-deer that wanders in the forest

Searching in vain=
 the source of his own smell,

All of mankind is deluded,

Only that one wh=
o meets the Satguru

Can perceive the illusion.

Satsang is the only way to=
 happiness,

Whoever attends, is loved by the Lord

And freed from Karma an=
d ignorance,

That river of knowledge removes all impurity,

The Saints are=
 God-incarnate,

Leading aspirants across the worldly ocean

And opening th=
eir inner eye of knowledge.

Mahaprabhuji says: Nothing belongs to you.

Ho=
ld onto the Truth and remember the Lord!



Gratefully the pilgrims absorbe=
d this song and respectfully bowed to
Mahaprabhuji before returning to thei=
r homes in peace.

Wherever Mahaprabhuji went, people would automatically g=
ather around
him, drawn like bees to nectar. They liked the way he taught a=
nd the way
he lived. All his actions and words were simple but everyone cou=
ld sense
the purity and sincerity with which he guided people to the experi=
ence
of the truth and not blind faith. He made no distinctions between peop=
le
because of caste or religion and so spiritual seekers of all social
clas=
ses and religious faiths were equally attracted to him.

Dear readers, here=
 I would like to mention something about perseverance
and sadhana to those =
who are on the path of spirituality. Initially
everyone is enthusiastic and=
 conscientiously performs his or her
practices. However, most soon succumb =
to one of two basic mistakes.
Either they decide that it's impossible for t=
hem to reach the aim
and thus give up, or else they consider that they are =
already perfect
and think they need not practise any more. What a grave mis=
take!
Mahaprabhuji used to say that practice was necessary no matter what
s=
tage one had reached.

"Water should always flow," he said. "If it stands s=
till it stagnates
and begins to stink."

The well from which water is drawn=
 is always replenished with that pure,
fresh water of the spring. But still=
 water becomes foul and undrinkable.
Continuity is a natural law of life, s=
tagnation is death. What we
commonly call a "standstill" is actually a step=
 taken back, by no means
does it mean stability. If we wish to avoid stagna=
ting, or going
backward in development, we need to keep practising whatever=

psychophysical, mental or spiritual discipline we believe in.

We should f=
aithfully continue our sadhana day by day throughout  our
entire life, whet=
her we are disciples or Masters. Dear readers,
Mahaprabhuji also continued =
to practise certain yoga techniques. If even
he, Perfection itself, still p=
ractised, then how necessary it is for us!

However, there are great differ=
ences regarding practice. Without correct
knowledge the aspirant can fall i=
nto all sorts of peculiar or harmful
disciplines and the following story is=
 about this.


[1]Kaji =3D Muslim scribe


[2]Kashi, Mathura, Priyag and Ha=
ridwar are the four most important
places of pilgrimage in India.
