 about=C2=A0what a Rishi can do. One Rishi is enough to change a universe, =
changing a country is child's play for Him." Wow. I let all these sink insi=
de me slowly. Therefore it is so important to keep doing sadhana, in some m=
anner or the other.
> =C2=A0

eft for the Manikarnika again. This was going be our last night of Chandi h=
oma at Manikarnika, for now. We walked long the=C2=A0deserted ghats, slient=
ly. I asked him if it is ok doing a=C2=A0homa of Shiva/Bhairava on a pyre. =
He said=C2=A0yes why not, but without Shakti, there will be no Shiva. Worsh=
ipping the divine feminie is the most practical strategy of sadhana. Shiva =
is the state of highest consciousness, and to reach that stage one must dev=
elop his body and mind such that it can hold shakti=C2=A0for which=C2=A0wor=
shipping the divine Mother is the best way.=C2=A0That is why Vimalananda sa=
ys, "Let the Mother show you the face of the Father". The topic drifted to =
Vimalananda. Manish said, "Kala Bhairava is very strong in Manikarnika, whe=
re as Mahakala exists powerfully in the cremation grouds at Ujjain. But Vim=
alananda did Mahakala sadhana here in Manikarnika." Then staring at the pit=
ch black ganges, Manish chuckled lightly and
>  added, "That man was someth=
ing." This was again an old conversation we had started=C2=A0before which M=
ainsh continued, "All these babas of today would wet their pants if Vimalan=
anda were to stand infornt of them. Those three books have the power of a d=
eity flowing through them. Without being physically present, Vimalananda ha=
s created a army of sadhakas!". I interjected, "The books=C2=A0are like a B=
ible=C2=A0for sadhakas,=C2=A0arn't they?". "Yes" said Manish. Later on I as=
ked him if it was possible for someone to meet Vimalanada, to which Manish =
replied that yes it was, if one does serious sadhana. However, the importan=
t question is whether one will be able to recognize him. I fell silent hear=
ing this. Interestingly, in the 2nd book of the Aghora series, Vimalanda do=
es mention that a time will come when his "children" would spread homas. St=
range, or maybe not so. Who knows how deep things run. 
> =C2=A0
> We reach=
ed the samshan by half past twelve. This time we sat at the same place wher=
e we had sat on the first day of homa. The fire was low. Most of the body h=
ad been burnt already. Manish started the homa. As usual, all the dogs came=
 and sat peacefully around the fire. Now this did not surprise me any more.=
 In the middle of the homa Manish would slowly lift his=C2=A0palm upwards=
=C2=A0and with the next ahuti=C2=A0immediately the fire would leap higher. =
He did this quite a few times, when=C2=A0the flames were getting weaker. I =
countinued with the Chandi path and passing on the samagri to him as and wh=
en he required anything. One dom who was working on a pyre nearby, came tow=
ards us and exclaimed,"Jai Mahadev". Manish too responded back, "Jai Mahade=
v". This homa was faster. He did not use any "samputs", but a direct, strai=
ght Chandi homa. Again in the middle I got up and stroked the pyre a bit, p=
ushing around some of the coconut pieces to make them burn properly. I was
=
>  enjoying it. A few people came and sat near us, listening to the path. I=
n Kasi there is a rule that whatever comes in the Samshan is the property o=
f the Dom Raja (the head of doms). No one has any further claim on it. In o=
ld times, one Dom Raja was called Kallu Dom. He was an Aghori and a contemp=
orary of Kinnaram Baba. It is said he could raise the dead back to life. Ma=
ybe it is because of this tradition that Manikarnika is such an apt place f=
or these sadhanas. I was at one point mentally wondering why are there so m=
any people in the samshan. The Manish said, if a Nath came here in his garb=
, everyone will run away from the samshan scared. But there is a reason why=
 there are people here even so late in the night.
> =C2=A0
> Once the final=
 purnahuti was given, we sat for meditation. Though this homa got over fast=
er than previous days, the meditation that happened, for me, was superb. At=
 one point I felt as if my mind would just burst forth and expand across th=
e length and breadth of the Ganges. My focus was good, but I had to open my=
 eyes after every 20 minutes or so. Manish continued meditating for nearly =
an hour. Not the slightest movement from him. Nothing. Still like a stone. =
Then a cow came and slightly nudged Manish on his feet. That made him open =
his eyes. Manish remarked, " I could have just left my body and gone off. I=
t did not matter that I had a flight to catch the next day, or anything els=
e. I was on the verge of death. Just at that moment the cow and brought me =
back." Smiling he added, "What a sight it would have been for the people to=
 see, how the body can be left at will".=C2=A0 I did not know what to say. =

> =C2=A0
> We stood there watching another pyre in front. The body was hal=
f burnt. The torso had become black with deep=C2=A0red patches all over. Th=
e dom came forward, and with the bamboo stick inserted it (the bamboo stick=
)=C2=A0from the side of the corpse, lifting up the burning torso into the a=
ir and placing it again, strategically, in the middle of the pyre. The smoo=
th=C2=A0motion of lifting up the half burnt torso, sticking out from one en=
d of the bamboo stick,=C2=A0into the thin, dark, night-air reminded me of h=
ow we use a fork to lift pieces of food - meat=C2=A0or vegetables, both dea=
d -=C2=A0from our plates to our mouths. Manish asked me smiling, "Maza aya?=
". I smiled back in acknowledgement. Then he commented=C2=A0that I should w=
rite about this experience in the coming days. Let people know.
> =C2=A0
> =
By this time I remembered that when I was sitting and doing the Chandi path=
, one dog=C2=A0had run off with one of my chappals. I informed Manish. He e=
xclaimed, " Kya baat hai! Leave the other chappal here as well." Manish sai=
d we had a rna with this samshan. We had been here before, in some life.
> =
=C2=A0
> As we were returning, Manish said one of the point (the three peak=
s)=C2=A0of Shiva's trishul passes through the Manikarkina. Therefore, it is=
 a "safe" samshan. Anyone who tries anything negative here will face troubl=
es. The trishul of Shiva guards this place. No spirit will cause any unnece=
ssary disturbance inside the samshan. That is also why there are people her=
e even at 2 am in the morning. There is safety in numbers. As long as ones =
intentions are genuine and good, Manikarnika is a wonderful place to do sad=
hana.
> =C2=A0
> While walking along the ghats=C2=A0which were=C2=A0totally=
 deserted, Manish instructed me not to stop. The knot in my red lungi was b=
ecoming loose, I caught hold of it=C2=A0with one=C2=A0hand and kept moving =
fast, trying to keep pace with Manish. Later Manish asked me if I had got s=
ome smell. I thought and recollected that yes, I did get a faint smell of h=
eena. Twice. Manish told me it was a "Mokul". A muslim spirit of similar le=
vel as a Yaksha or a Yakshini. Once the ritual is over, and you are out of =
the samshan, do not wait along the banks, he instructed. Do not move too cl=
ose to the water=C2=A0late in the nightt. There are things in the water. Ge=
nerally they may not do anything, but why take a chance. The protection of =
Shiva is only inside the Manikarnika Ghat. Then he added, Deoriya Baba (I m=
ay have mis-spelt the name) used to live in the middle of this Ganges 24/7.=
 This is a city of saints. Here God-intoxicated Paramhamsas would roam arou=
nd naked. It is their city.
> =C2=A0
> Next morning, as we sat recollecting=
 the previous night's homa, Manish talked about Vedas.=C2=A0Few sadhaks, if=
 ever, are equally comfortable with both paths of=C2=A0Aghora and Vedas. Fo=

ana in the samshan. Manish=C2=A0laughed and replied,=C2=A0"Karna to sab kuc=

> =C2=A0
> Back to midnight. We reached Manikarnika and again it was fi=
lled with people. But this time we did not wait. We went right inside, and =
Manish kept looking for a suitable chita. As we came in, again people start=
ed staring at us, but they respectfully made way for us to pass through to =
the middle of the samshan. We stood exactly at the middle, with Manish obse=
rving the different chitas. There were about 8/10 of them burning. It is sa=
id in thousands of years there has not been a single minute when there has =
not been a body burning in here. Therefore it is one of the Mahasamshans in=
 India. There was one chita to my right which Manish was observing, when su=
ddenly I found a mega size bull come and stand right next to the fire. I di=
d not want to sit there, the bull looked dangerous. Before I could voice my=
 concern, Manish said let us go to the other side of the samshan. It not on=
ly the bull,=C2=A0 but there is something else as well. I did not ask him w=
hat. So we
>  went to another side. The dom there came forward and said to =
Manish, "Baba,aap log=C2=A0kaun se chita me baithna chahate ho?". Manish in=
dicated one at the end, the dome then went ahead and asked the people stand=
ing around the chita to make space for us to sit. He said the heat from the=
 fire is too stong, but Manish said it's ok, we'll sit here itself. There w=
ere many curious onlookers, but all made space for us to sit comfortably. I=
 could hear the dom instructing others not to disturb the pyre we were sitt=
ing at. This is something very unique about Manikarnika. IN any other city,=
 people would have objected, but not here. Manish later said, it is a tradi=
tion of this place, Aghor sadhanas have been done in here for countless cen=
turies. Therefore the domes have either themsleves seen these things or hea=
rd from their families and thus they do not disturb. 
> =C2=A0
> The homa, =
as usual was awesome. The pyre was larger than the one previous night. The =
heat was very strong. My focus was stronger. My mind was much calmer than t=
he previous night. Within ten minutes again a pack of dogs came and sat aro=
und this pyre. This was strange because=C2=A0there were at least ten pyres =
burning, and all of them chose this specific pyre for some inexplicable rea=
son. Dogs have a far subtler sense perception than average humans like me. =
This homa was extended longer. Every now and then Manish would suddenly loo=
k at a certain direction intently for a few second. I too would turn and lo=
ok that way but saw nothing. But, everytime Manish looked at a specific dir=
ection or made some gestures, the dogs too would start barking at that dire=

uite abit of smoke, I saw a transformer bursting. The dogs immediately star=
ted barking at that. Later Manish said the Goddess was moving around, enter=
ing the fire and leaving the fire. The bursting of the transformer had a li=
nk to this. As the Path was going on - the Chandi was in my right hand - I =
saw a human shadow pass over=C2=A0the pages of the=C2=A0book. I thought it =
was some relative who was standing behind me.=C2=A0I looked back and was a =
shocked to find there was no one behind me. And the shadow passed over my b=
ook once again. This time I did not look back. Just kept chanting with more=
 vigor and saying to myself "all iz well"-:).=C2=A0 Manish later said, as o=
ne does sadhana the deity often comes to observe and make his/her presence =
felt, even if slightly.=C2=A0It is not an imagination but reality and this =
can=C2=A0happen not just in a samshan but in any sadhana anywhere. The idea=
 is to keep doing sadhana.

> While offering coconuts into the fire=
, one coconut rolled off from the pyre. So I took a long bamboo stick which=
 the domes use to stroke the fire and pushed the coconut piece inside.I won=
dered if I=C2=A0had been a dom in any of my past lives, because I strangely=
 felt natural stroking the pyre=C2=A0the way the domes do. I even wondered =
if=C2=A0there was any company which would may me for this kind of a job, I =
would happily take it. What better way to do sadhana than become a dom at M=
anikarkina!=C2=A0Interestingly, I then remembered that Manish had bought on=
e extra coconut while buying the samagri to tonight's homas. Now I understo=
od why.
> =C2=A0
> In the middle of the homa, suddenly Manish called one of=
 the relatives who was standing nearby and told him=C2=A0that the person wh=
os body was in the pyre has just left and that=C2=A0they (relatives) do not=
 have to wait any more. It was already late in the night. The person did no=
t know what to say. Suddenly Manish explained to him, do not worry, there i=
s nothing evil or bad being done here. We are only praying to Ma Durga. I g=
uess the person was mentally wondering about what is going on. Then another=
 of the relatives came forward and said, "Baba, hum log ahsirwad leke hi ja=
yenge". So Manish said ok and asked them to sit down and continued with the=
 homa. In the middle of the homa suddenly Manish asked me to observe the sk=
in on the corpse=C2=A0 I saw the skin on the face had caught fire and was b=
urning. It was a sight to see!
> =C2=A0
> There is a tradition of pouring G=
anges water=C2=A0at the end to finsh the fire. But I could hear the domes t=
elling the relatives not to pour water on the pyre or do anything there wit=
hout permissin from Manish. Finally at the end they came to Manish and=C2=
=A0asked if they could pour some Ganges water. Manish said ok, but in a low=
 voice told me nothing will happen to the fire, it won't die. They poured a=
 large mud kalash full of water but nothing happened to the fire. It kept b=
urning. After some times, after some more ahutis, Manish called the people =
and said, " Devi=C2=A0samne khadi hai. App log pranam kijiye". At least 10/=
15 people came forward and reventially bowed to the fire. Then they wanted =
to touch=C2=A0Manish's feet, but Manish would not let them do so. They aske=
d for his blessings. He distributed some flower petals we had and told them=
 to go home, since it was very late in the night. Suddenly the man, who had=
 some doubts (whom Manish had addressed earlier) came
>  running with tears=
 in his eyes asking for forgiveness for having doubted. Manish consoled him=
, told him nothing to worry, he has done no wrong, everything is all right.=
=C2=A0 Later Manish said, if it was some other time of the day he would hav=
e brought the man along for a cup of tea. Another person suddenly came to M=
anish and asked him if he was a certain saint (a famous saint)=C2=A0who use=
d to live in Kasi. Manish without responding to his query asked him where w=
as he from, the person replied interior=C2=A0Bihar. Manish advised him to g=
o back home as it was late in the night. The faith of the ordinary people o=
f this land is what makes India so unique, that is why our land and culture=
 is still so alive. We city bred 'educated'=C2=A0people are too rational to=
 understand these things. God loves the simple and uncalculating. By this t=
ime I too stood up to do pranam to the fire. Immediately I felt as if my bo=
dy existed only from my head to my heart, there was nothing

gs, no stomach ,=C2=A0as if=C2=A0I was simply floating on thin=C2=A0air! I =
told Manish what happened, he just gave a=C2=A0curt one word reply, "Good".=

> As we were walking back from Manikarnika Mani=
sh suddenly said, "There is a foreigner lady who lives close to Manikarnika=
, who has a lot of desire to perform sadhanas in the samshan but does not k=
now how to go about it. I saw her while meditating." For a woman to come an=
d perform these sadhanas is practically difficult or impossible, unless she=
 is a Yogini or a sadhaka of great calibre. Ordinary people would not be ab=
le to meet the gaze of a Yogini, said Manish. The next morning, when we cam=
e to the Lalita Ghat (as I mentioned above), I saw a thin, frail, looking f=
oreigner lady sitting on the banks. Manish quitely indicated to me that, th=
at is the lady whom he had seen last night in his meditation at the samshan=
. "She has desire, but directionless. " At that time there was nothing more=
 we could do. I guess that is why it is so important to keep doing some sad=
hana on your own, instead of merely contemplating which is of no good,=C2=

=A0
> After passing the Lalita Ghat, next afternoon,=C2=A0we stood and obse=
rved Manikarnika from a distance. We were dressed like any other tourist, s=
pecially with Manish's camera hanging from his neck=C2=A0and the=C2=A0tripo=
d. Manish smiled and said let us not go too close to Manikarnika, what if t=
he doms recognize us! They would be shell shocked seeing us dressed as tour=
ists, wondering what is going on.
