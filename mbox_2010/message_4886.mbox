Dear Nithin,

kunjika goes a step further it is like a key to unlock saptas=
hati :-)

I guess I still have to disagree with=C2=A0you.-:)

One who has n=
ot=C2=A0mastered (mastering often means lifetimes)=C2=A0sadhana of Chandipa=
th 
and yet jumped into Kunjika will hardly gain anything. As I said I am y=
et to see 
one sadhaka who can show any tangible effects using the Kunjika =
by itself. The 
so called "step futher" in this desh-kaal-patra is inaccess=
ible to 99.999 
percent of sadhakas, even genuinely good sadhakas. =C2=A0 T=
herefore, for most people 
the Kunjika is more like the "emperor's new clot=
hes". The clothes do not exist 
in reality (cannot produce any tangible eff=
ect through Kunjika), but pressure of 
tradition makes one believe that the=
y do! It is a comic situation.

believe that the statement was not result o=
f corruption 

The Kunjika itself is not a corruption, but the misplaced=C2=
=A0belief that without 
=C2=A0reading the=C2=A0Kunjika, Chandipath is incom=
plete or without Kunjika path 
the=C2=A0Chandipath cannot be "unlocked" is =
a corruption.=C2=A0 It is just one belief of 
some paramparas, not shared u=
niversally. Definitely not accepted=C2=A0by the 
paramparas which originate=
 in the land which is the heart=C2=A0of Shakta worship 
(maimum worship of =
Chandi has happened in Assam/Bengal region).

So we just have to firmly dis=
gree on this.

-Regards
=C2=A0Rajarshi

Well your reasoning is valid but i have strong reasons to believe=
 that the 
statement was not result of corruption but shiva himself said so=
