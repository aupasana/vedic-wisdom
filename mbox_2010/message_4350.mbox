 1) One=E2=80=99s greatness increases to the extent one becomes humble. The=
 reason
why God is Supreme to such an extent that the whole universe bows t=
o Him,is
His sublime state of humility in which the deluded ego never rises=

unknowingly.

2) For a wise aspirant who seeks to gain true greatness,it i=
s best to pay
his homage [namaskarams] to others until complete egolessness=
 is achieved.
On the other hand, it is indeed dangerous for him to accept h=
omage from
others.

3) A devotee asked Sri Bhagavan, =E2=80=9CWhat is your =
feeling when hundreds of
people come and do pranams to you?=E2=80=9D Withou=
t hesitation,

Sri Bhagavan replied: =E2=80=9CFirst I do my namaskarams to =
each one of them as soon
as they enter this room, and then only they do so.=
 Subsiding one=E2=80=99s ego is
the right and real form of doing namaskaram=
s. Do I not have more chances
each day to do such namaskarams than anyone w=
ho comes here?=E2=80=9D

4) The hollow and flimsy straw floats high on the =
surface of the sea, while
the heavy pearl lies low at the bottom of the sea=
. Likewise, though the
worthless one is positioned above, he is really low,=
 and though the great
one is positioned below, he is never low.

Sadhu Om: =
The last two lines of this verse are verse 973 of Tirukkural, the
3rd verse=
 in the chapter entitled =E2=80=98Greatness=E2=80=99.

One day, some devote=
es contrived to send away from the presence of Sri
Bhagavan a person who ad=
amantly wanted a seat no less high than that of Sri
Bhagavan.

Guessing wha=
t had happened,Sri Bhagavan at once remarked, pointing his
finger above his=
 head, =E2=80=9COh, you are very happy in driving him away; but what
will y=
ou do with this one?=E2=80=9D Just above the head of Sri Bhagavan,there was=
 a
monkey sitting on the branch of a tree stretching its tail towards him! =
The
devotees felt repentant for their mistake.Is not this incident a direct=
 and
practical explanation of this verse?
