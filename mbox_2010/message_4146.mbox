Namaste,

I am trying to seek an answer for certain experiences. I would be=
 obliged if anyone can share his/ her thoughts (or suggested reading materi=
al) on this. 

These days whenever I close my eyes even for a while I can s=
ee a purple color, sometimes even with a magenta combination.  To go a step=
 further, at times while talking to someone if I casually close my eyes I c=
an his/ her image with all the red, orange, yellow & blue colors (something=
 like an aura). However, I do not see an image for each and every person. A=
t certain times, I have seen colors for objects/ non-living beings too. And=
 at the same time I might not see anything with my eyes closed even when th=
e room is full of people.  Splashing water on my face feels like spraying b=
lue shades on red/magenta. Not sure, why this is and if it makes any sense.=


Its been almost more than a month now and I am really curious to find out=
 the reason. Earlier, I even thought that I may have some problem with my e=
yes. Generally, the only time I see these colors (especially purple & green=
) is while meditating. To be honest, although I pray to God daily, I havent=
 been getting enough time to meditate regularly for the past few weeks.

Th=
ank you.

Gargi
