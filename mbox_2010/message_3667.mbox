Dear KK,
=C2=A0
Nice question. I was also thinking that.
=C2=A0
Few da=
ys back when I went to Calcutta, (where fish is the staple diet), one perso=
n told me confidently that there is no harm in eating fish or meat because =
Swamiji used to do so, and in a Bengali book on the=C2=A0life of Sri Ramakr=
ishna there is one example mentioned where a man came to ask him if should =
quite non veg food, and supposedly Ramakrishna said first leave "Kamini" an=
d "Kanchana", then think of food. =C2=A0Also a similar examples was quoted =
to me from=C2=A0the life of Ma Sarada where - a certain book says - she adv=
ised an ordinary devotee against leaving fish eating and rather just focus =
mind on God.
=C2=A0
When I tried to reason with them that if these people w=
ere to come back again on planet earth they may not recommend non veg eatin=
g - considering the state of the world today - I=C2=A0 was catergorically t=
old they are all Trikalagyas, so if there is something wrong in eating fish=
 they would have told right then.=C2=A0 
=C2=A0
Then I tried to say that th=
e examples maybe specific individual cases, to which I was told, "no", beca=
use based on a whole plethora of such examples even today the monks of the =
Ramakrishna Order in West Bengal eat and serve fish. This statement is a fa=
ct. I=C2=A0have had fish meals as prasad in many Ramakrishna Missions acros=
s=C2=A0West Bengal.=C2=A0So, I was told, the monks of the Ramakrishna Oder =
know about teachings of Ramakrishna and Ma Sarada better than us ordrinary =
people. 
=C2=A0
I could make no further arguments and of course had a harro=
wing time at home trying to convince my parents that I have quit non veg fo=
od. 
=C2=A0
A lot of Bengalis may not have been able to implement the basic=
 teachings of Ramakrishna in their lives, however they faithfully follow fi=
sh eating as a sanction given by "Thakur" and "Sri Sri Ma" and "Swamiji".
=
=C2=A0

I tend to agree with you that all the members in your examples are h=

In Bhagawadgita, Lord Sri Krishna tells that whatever the noble says, o=

Dear KK,

Correction in my earlier message =E2=80=
=93 It should read `Aghora, at the left hand of God'

A sincere suggestion =
from me- No need to address me with `Ji' suffix. However, you are free to a=
ddress me as you feel like and I'll happily accept it hence forth.

I just =
came across Vimalananda' s thought on Karma. He says (and Narasimha has man=
y a times repeated) that Karma is only generated (Binding to one) when one =
self-identifies with it.
Although, it may seem easy to understand intellect=
ually, the state is multiple times difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, it's=
 an extremely important statement to answer our queries.

Important informa=
tion about Vimalananda which I came to know only yesterday is that he was a=
 big time smoker and there was not a single day passed in his life when he =
didn't do smoking except on the final day of his departure from physical bo=
dy. He used to as well `chew Tobacco' frequently and occasionally ate meat.=
 I gave this information, because as you pointed out (and I also agree) tha=
t it is an interesting coincidence of exact thoughts crossing our minds. Fu=
rther, please also note an important thing. The Aghori used to say very fre=
quently to all his audience to do what he says and not try to do what he do=
es.

Now whatever I wrote above seems sufficient to answer the questions yo=
u asked. Let me put in my thoughts further (Mind you, these are thoughts of=
 an unrealized person and the worth can be next to nothing). When we take e=
xample cases of Swami Vivekananda or Vimalananda or Sainbaba or any other s=
uch acknowledged spiritual giants, we tend to forget that they are all real=
ized souls who achieved very high level of spiritual realization. They are =
knower of everything or many things in the universe. Their individual ego i=
s perfectly and completely tuned to universal ego. In short they *know* wha=
t they are doing. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis'. Relevant to our topic of dis=
cussion, I would say that if they ate meat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco o=
r killed animals, they actually knew what they are doing. There would be su=
rely a specific purpose behind each and every action of theirs because as I=
 said, they know complete background behind their each action and
 moreover=
 their self identification is missing from the action and hence it is like =
Nature operates through them to accomplish a special purpose without bindin=
g them in any cause-effect chain.
Ramakrishna used to frequently say to all=
 his disciples that Naren is very different from others. He has a blazing s=
piritual fire burning within him which can consume anything and everything.=
 A food restriction does not bind him. He can eat anything without getting =
spiritually troubled but for others, a kind of food intake is extremely imp=
ortant.
If Vivekananda ate meat during his stay in west, it'll surely have =
some subtle purpose which is not possible for majority of us to comprehend =
unless explained by a person of that level. He might be removing `guilt' fr=
om the sincere seekers amongst westerners so that he can be accepted by the=
m as one of them and then slowly try to eradicate their habits of meat eati=
ng and such other undesirable habits. It is also possible at the same time =
that he is nullifying some balanced Rinanubandha with the `Animal' whose me=
at he ate. It is also possible that he would have showered his unseen bless=
ings on the animal's soul by consuming its meat. It's possible that there w=
ere no apparent reasons for that but just a natural inconsequential act. We=
'll not know. Only Vivekananda, His Guru and Mother Nature know. By the way=
 Vivekananda saved a boy from drowning in a lake in USA while he was still =
in India and did not even planned to go to USA. When the boy, after some
 y=
ears actually met Swami in USA for the first time, swami immediately told h=
im to stay away from water and when he requested swami to accept him as his=
 disciple, swami, after a moments thought told him that he is not his guru =
and his guru will come later and will give him Silver Cup as a gift. That m=
an later became disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda and after 40 years, he was=
 actually given a gift of Silver-cup by Yogananda which literally fulfilled=
 what swami Vivekananda `knew' before 40 years.

Swami Vivekananda was all =
knowing and most of us are NOT.

So moral of my whole writings is that it's=
 unwise as well as self deluding to take excuses of the unconventional habi=
ts of Swami Vivekananda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vimalananda, Gajanana Maharaj, Sw=
ami Samarth, Trailang Swami and such masters and justify our completely sel=
f identified and utterly selfish cruel/unjust actions.

Utpa=

eekers amongst westerners so that he can be accepted by them as one of them=
 and then slowly try to eradicate their habits of meat eating and such othe=
r undesirable habits. It is also possible at the same time that he is nulli=
fying some balanced Rinanubandha with the `Animal' whose meat he ate. It is=
 also possible that he would have showered his unseen blessings on the anim=
al's soul by consuming its meat. It's possible that there were no apparent =
reasons for that but just a natural inconsequential act. We'll not know. On=
ly Vivekananda, His Guru and Mother Nature know. By the way Vivekananda sav=

 not even planned to go to USA. When the boy, after some years actually met=
 Swami in USA for the first time, swami immediately told him to stay away f=

 and when he requested swami to accept him as his disciple, swami=

disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda and after 40 years, he was actually given =
a gift of Silver-cup by Yogananda which literally fulfilled what swami Vive=
kananda `knew' before 40 years.<BR><BR>Swami Vivekananda was all knowing an=

 is a most painful way to die. Then it w=
