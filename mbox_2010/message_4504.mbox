Namaste,
 
Yes, I mean rituals one may do individually or as a part of a group, either at home or at a temple or another public place. Archana and abhishekam performed by a priest at a temple are also included.
 
If you want to remove a small rock blocking the road, a small amount of energy may be sufficient. If a big boulder is blocking the road, one cannot push it away just like that. One has to keep exerting force and push it persistently. Similarly, small problems are easy to solve. But most people now-a-days are bogged down by serious kaarmic blockages that require a lot of effort to overcome.
 
Of course, if a superman is available to you to help, he may push the boulder in a second. But there are hardly any supermen anymore.
 
In the old days, many priests existed who did intense sadhana, became enlightened and were like walking fire. Also, many temples existed, where such priests, great yogis and rishis did sadhana and left great energy. Thus, big kaarmik problems could also be solved with one pooja, one homam, one abhishekam, one visit to a temple etc.
 
Such priests and temples are quite rare today. Do not expect one pooja, one archana, one homam or one abhishekam to solve problems.
 
However, little bit at a time adds up over time. If you keep doing sadhana (pooja, archana, homam, abhishekam etc) regularly, it will slowly add up.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

> Absolutely. We should have nothing against them. Giving them money or helping them or engaging them is perfectly noble. My only point is that *most* (though not all) of them have no ability to give a boost to the material and spiritual pursuit of others (like many priests of old days did) and hence people should not leave the remedying of their problem completely to the priest (they are very likely to be disappointed that way). If they realize that they are on their own and do something about it, they are more likely to succeed over time.

> Jyotisha readings that you talk about the end are a different ball game. They are mostly an intellectual exercise and can be done well by one without spiritual energy. But, doing a ritual for someone and giving a boost to one's material and spiritual pursuits (using one's own spiritual energy by using the ritual as a tool) is a spiritual exercise and one without a good level of spiritual energy cannot do it well. These days, people hardly have enough spiritual energy to fix their own blockages and how can they take care of others?
