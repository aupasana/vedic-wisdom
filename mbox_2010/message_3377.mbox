 Bhagavan frequently told me [Annamalai Swami] that I should be aware of th=
e
Self while I was working.

He repeatedly told me, 'Don't forget your real=
 nature. It is not necessary
that you should sit and meditate. You should m=
editate all the time, even
while you are working.'

In the beginning, when =
I first came to Bhagavan, I asked him for a mantra.
In response he told me =
to repeat 'Siva Siva' continuously. Later, Bhagavan
advised me to keep my a=
ttention in the Heart while I was working. I had read
that Bhagavan had spo=
ken of a place called the Heart-centre which he located
in the right side o=
f the chest. I had assumed that Bhagavan wanted me to
concentrate on this p=
articular centre. However, when I started to practise
in this way, Bhagavan=
 stopped me and corrected me.

'This right-side Heart-centre is not the tru=
e Heart," he said. 'The real
Heart is not located anywhere. It is all-perva=
sive.'

'Stop meditating on the Heart-centre,' he continued. 'Find the sour=
ce. That
is the true Heart. Just as electricity comes not from the individu=
al meter
boxes in people's houses but from a single source, so too the whol=
e world
has a single source, which is the Self or the Heart. Seek and enqui=
re into
this source of limitless energy. If the centre of the Self were rea=
lly
located in the body, the Self would die when the body dies."
