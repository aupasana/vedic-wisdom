 I mentioned this earlier. Manish told me oneday that he "saw me" doing my =
daily Chandi homam while he was driving fast on a highway in UK. He lifted =
one hand in abhaya mudra (blessing pose) while driving. His wife asked what=
 he was doing. He said he told her, "Narasimha is doing homam right now. I =
am blessing him."

mally wear red or yellow or white veshti and anga vastram (lower cloth and =
upper cloth) for my homam. That day I was wearing a blue veshti and a blue =
T-shirt. I was gifted that blue veshti by a priest and wore it only twice u=
ntil now. So one is unlikely to *guess* this. I asked him, "if you saw me, =
tell me what kind of clothes I was wearing." He said, "Narasimha, it seemed=
 like some shade of blue. You were wearing a T-shirt and it was also anothe=
r shade of blue." He was correct. If one was merely guessing it, the probab=
ility of getting is correct was very very small - almost zero.

vading orange light. I saw that there was a person at the center of that li=
ght, who was emiting that light. When I looked closer, it was Manish. After=
 a little time, he suddenly transformed into a very famous saint from the p=
ast. I wondered "why did Manish change into that saint". That disturbed my =
focus and my regular self-awareness returned and I became aware that I was =
Narasimha meditating in that garbhalaya and Manish was sitting in front of =
me. I opened my eyes. At the same time, Manish also opened his eyes. Withou=
