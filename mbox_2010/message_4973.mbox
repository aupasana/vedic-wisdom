Namaste,
 
I have a word of caution regarding mental homam. If one with a w=
eak internal fire visualizes an internal homam, it will not be that effecti=
ve. Of course, it is safe to do and is better than sitting idle or watching=
 TV or other such activities. But homam in an external fire is more effecti=
ve for most people.
 
When we do homam, i.e. when we invoke a deity in fire=
 and make offerings while focusing the mind on sacred chants, essentially w=
e are trying to strengthen, by resonance, the fire that burns inside one, w=
hich transforms all of one's "experiences" into the underlying Truth. This =
is the fire that makes one experience deities and finally the Absolute. Jus=
t as a young scholar benefits from spending time with a teacher or a mentor=
 or a senior scholar, this internal fire benefits from spending time with a=
 good-sized external fire in which deities are invited and visualized.
 
* =
       *        *
 
Apart from this fundamental fire, there are so many spe=
cific fires in us. For example, jatharaagni (digestive fire) burns in the s=
tomach and digests food. Whenever you are eating, you are effectively perfo=
rming a homam in this fire. Of course, this fire is grosser than the above =
subtle fire that allows us to experience the Absolute. Nevertheless, it is =
fire too. Whenever you eat any food, you can chant a mantra and imagine tha=
t you are making the offering to god.
 
*        *        *
 
Please rememb=
er one thing. There are some people on this yahoogroup, who are already qui=
te pure with just a few shortcomings that are blocking them. They have made=
 good progress in the last 3-4 years. In the years to come, some more peopl=
e will make a lot of progress. What is good enough for them may not be good=
 enough for most people.

Why not? Even in an external homam, one can offer s=
ome simple food and imagine the god in fire to be actually eating that food=
! External ritual is not an obstruction for visualization. In fact, it prov=
ides a platform for visualization. You can build whatever structures you wa=
nt, on top of that platform!
 
One can imagine that the deity is really sit=
ting in fire. One can imagine that the deity is being given a garland with =
several nice flowers. One can imagine that the deity is enjoying the incens=
e. One can imagine that the deity is enjoying nice foods. And so on.

Absolutely. Of course,=
 don't do it intentionally. That would be a pretension.
 
If you start medi=
tating in the middle of homam and lose track of homam and fire goes away by=
 the time you come back to your senses, do not worry about it. But, if you =
are fully aware of your surroundings and homam, it is a good idea to ensure=
 that the fire does not go away.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

 My second attempt was when I had to travel to another town and I did not c=
