 him not to take any more wood. The dome nodded his head and did not distur=

eing in a samshan and observing the human body burning up has a powerful ef=

 body burning. Both the femurs were visible and spread apart. In an ordinar=
y setting, this kind of a scene would mean a woman with "legs spread apart"=
 which has a very sexual connotation. In Manikarnik, on that night, it only=
 evoked a feeling of how eventually the body is merely a covering for somet=

 etc will perish as they are ment to perish. Only Rama naam satya hai.
