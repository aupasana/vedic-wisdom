I know one person with spiritual inclination who went on a long pilgrimage visiting many temples and ashrams in India. He was hoping that he would meet a realized master who would bless him and give him a big push spiritually. He was an old classmate of Manish and Manish was telling him from the beginning that he would not find anyone like that. Manish told him to just sit at home and do intense sadhana - homam, japam etc. But still that person wanted to go around in search of a guru who would lift him. No need to say he did not find anyone like that.
 
*        *        *
 
We indeed had spiritual masters in the past who were capable of lifting people just like that. However, such masters are rare today. In fact, Paramahansa Yogananda said that great masters will no longer descend to earth in coming years. I interpret what he said slightly differently. Some great masters may still descend to earth in future, but they may not act like the sadgurus of past. They may only show the (a) path and leave responsibility in the hands of people.
 
Why should it be so?
 
The age of fake swamis and babas who are secretly after name and money has dawned (or will soon dawn) on earth. They will pretend to be realized masters though they are not. They will be difficult to discern. This is going to render futile for many the search for a sadguru to whom one can completely surrender. In the old days, if you found a sadguru, surrendered to him/her and followed his/her commands blindly, your life would be made and you would achieve whatever was meant to be achieved spiritually in that life. However, the same cannot be said about following a fake guru blindly. In an age when there are probably going to be far more fake gurus than sadgurus, isn't it advisable to rewrite the blueprint of a spiritual journey? Instead of searching for a sadguru and surrendering to him, it may be better for most seekers to just do sadhana and take God or Fire as guru as Rajarshi wisely said.
 
The old thinking will slowly be replaced by a new model appropriate for the new times. What Paramahansa Yogananda said is along the same lines. More developments in future may re-inforce the new approach.
 
*        *        *
 
Paramahansa Yogananda said that great masters will not descend to earth in future. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said that he would be back after about 100 years accompanied by others who accompanied him earlier and that many people would be liberated en masse this time. How do we reconcile?
 
Quite possibly, Ramakrishna will not do any miracles or touch people and grant them liberation just like that, but he will probably show them how to find god. He will not take them to god himself, but point them to a path that will lead to god. He will probably inspire many people to do intense sadhana and become liberated.
 
*        *        *
 
In the old days, we had brave kshatriyas who were very dharmik and unselfish. It made sense to put power completely and unconditionally in their hands. It worked for the benefit of all. As such kshatriyas became rare and world started to be dominated by adharmik and selfish seekers of power, Nature adjusted the course of humanity and most of the world is today based on the concept of democracy or switching to it slowly.
 
In spiritual matters also, we had learned braahmanas who were very dharmik, unselfish and liberated. it made sense to place people's spiritual lives completely and unconditionally in their hands. As such braahmanas become rare and world starts to be dominated by adharmik and selfish possessors of knowledge (who are still in the web of Maayaa), Nature may adjust the course of humanity and redefine religion and spiritual progress based on more relevant concepts and ideas.
 
*        *        *
 
The bottomline: If you like a guru or his teachings, benefit from them. But do not worry about finding a sadguru as given in some scriptures and just keep doing sadhana. Surrender to god, do homam/japam etc and wait patiently. It is a more fruitful method than to search for a sadguru who will lift you.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

Souls who might have been brahmacharis in all previous births, would probably not be able to remain so when born in thid age is a simple fact of nature, otherwise how else is Kali Yuga to be different from other yugas? She wants it that way and so it is that way.

Each one must take God as his/her guru and keep doing sadhana and Nature will teach in the best possible way. In this regard, fire can act as an excellent guru if one keeps doing homas for some years.

He has a charming and endearing disposition and a lucid and eloquent way of explaining high philosophy in simple and demystified terms. Irrespective of his weaknesses that may have been exposed now, he is clearly a man of excellent knowledge and rare wisdom. Who is to tell how *we* will fare when our time comes for a test?

Take your mind off god for a second and you CAN fall. When we are not in a state where mind is focused on god 24x7, we are vulnerable to a fall. Then why should we judge others?

There may be some members of this group who make good progress in the coming years and people around them may start noticing their purity and treating them specially. The key is to not be swayed by name, fame, image, following, respect, money etc and retain the mindset of a dedicated servant, in the midst of either adulation or adversity. If one allows self-consciousness, ego and pride to take root in one's mind, one thing leads to another and one falls in the web of Mahamaya.

A blue sky does not suddenly become green if the greatest liar says sky is blue. Similarly, spiritual truths do not become invalid if a person who taught them fell.
