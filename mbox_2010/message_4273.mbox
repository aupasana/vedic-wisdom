Adesh! I will venture a response.

One does not "do K=

     Yoga Vashista says: "All things that ex=

    Okay. How does this statement pr=
ove world is unreal ?

    Thus scientists are veering round to the conclus=

object is a sum of its qualities and these
     qualit=

and  energy=
, atoms and stars does not exist except as a construction of
     conscious=
ness.

    Which scientist says universe is a construction of consciousness=
 ?

    Why does consciousness construct anything ? Why can't it just be as=
 it
is ? What is the need for an unreal world ?


I understand your point a=
bout consciousness. I agree that it just "Is", and
that the extrapolation o=
f "doing" is only a figment of our minds and egos in
order to try and under=
stand it. The funny thing is, though, that only
consciousness can understan=
d consciousness. All we can do is invent
languages and stumble around tryin=
g to square "it" in our organic brains.

However, the universe really is, o=
n a level of actuality, unreal. It seems
real to us because we are also cha=
racters in the same movie. A quick study
of quantum psychics will swiftly s=
how you that. There is no such thing as
"solid" material, the closest this =
universe gets to solidity (and hence
"realness") is a black hole, which is =
so out of place that it rips apart the
fabric of space and time, so that no=
t even light, a massless particle (a
paradox if there ever was one) can esc=
ape its grasp. Similarly, though on a
different level of course, the Ego tr=
ies to find and create solidity on
earth which draws Chaos to it, which req=
uires further constructions of
solidity ("beliefs") to bolster it. The only=
 thing that allows the
appearance of "things" as "separate" from other "thi=
ngs", is electromagnetic
energy, or shakti, in her symbolic form as Maya.

=
India (Bharat) has come up with many scientific ideas that form the basis
(=
foundation) of Western science. *And they did it through meditation on
Cons=
ciousness*.

=E2=80=9CWe owe a lot to the Indians, who taught us how to cou=
nt, without which no
worthwhile scientific discovery could have been made.=
=E2=80=9D - Albert Einstein

Carl Sagan:
"The tenth episode of COSMOS is la=
rgely about cosmology - the study of the
universe in a perspective in which=
 the Earth is like a grain to stand in
vast beach or desert - and the way w=
e approach the subject is through Hindu
cosmology. ... But the main reason =
that we oriented this episode of COSMOS
towards India is because of that wo=
nderful aspect of Hindu cosmology which
first of all gives a time-scale for=
 the Earth and the universe -- a
time-scale which is consonant with that of=
 modern scientific cosmology. ...
As far as I know. It is the only ancient =
religious tradition on the Earth
which talks about the right time-scale."

=
Few are the scientists that are brave enough to stand up and grant Bharat
h=
er rightful inheritance, because they suffer from their own cultural
xenoph=
obia and religious bigotry, but that is a whole different subject....

It i=
s possibly only an assumption that the universe is a construction of
Consci=
ousness, however, Consciousness is one of the only "things", if not
the *on=
ly* thing, that can never be "this". Take away everything that is
"This", a=
nd the only thing left is "That". It's sort of how 2 hydrogen
molecules ele=
ctromagnetically bond with one oxygen molecule, and "Live" as
what we human=
s have labeled "Water". There is no such thing as "water", per
se, there ar=
e only electrons, protons, and neutrons -etc.- bumping around in
a vast sea=
 of Chaos, the substratum, what we call Brahma.

By the way, I am a Caucasi=
an, American by birth, who considered himself an
atheist for many years (I =
presently live in India and am Hindu). When I
discovered the greatness of t=
he Rishis, the Vedas, Upanishads, etc., I
realized how much *more* splendid=
 this planet could be with the Sanatana
Dharma respected for the greatness,=
 beauty, and Truth it holds and bestows
upon us, who are also That (Conscio=
usness is not divided as the Upanishad
states 'take the full from the full,=
 and the full remains.' I don't offhand
recall the attribution.)


     I'm=
 just questioning certain basic assumptions of Advaita


They are also "ass=
umptions" that have been laboratory tested in the halls of
science and prov=
en sound.


    which seem to be totally opposite of what  Bhagavad Gita is=
 saying. In
fact what you are saying leads to nihilism which is what Buddhi=
sts say. If
you agree that you believe in Buddhism we can move on. But if y=
ou say all
what you are saying is in Vedas , then I will question.


Nihili=
sm is an attitude of defeatism. It is not an attitude of respectful
worship=
 towards this great mystery that we call the universe, the cosmos,
which we=
 are a part of; and Life itself, which animates us and all other
living thi=
ngs.

I consider every "thing" as "alive". The main difference in us is tha=
t we
have a brain which allows us access to levels of Understanding not pos=
sible
without a complex symbolic language. There is no difference between m=
e, you,
a drop of water, a worm, the Sun, etc., except in appearance due to=
 Maya.

I have a Mithuna Lagna (which should be obvious!) so I tend to thin=
k of
things on an intellectual level. However, Maa Maya/Kali/Parvati (diffe=
rent
facets of shakti) makes it easy for my human mind to grasp the Dance o=
f Life
and Existence, and I stand in awe before this great tapestry of Brah=
man's
dream.

While I hesitate to say this, the BG takes one aspect of the =
universe (the
Creative aspect, symbolized as Vishnu) and grants it an all-e=
ncompassing
power over all that is. A Shivaite would say that the Destructi=
ve aspect
(entropy) is actually the engine of life, and hence Shiva is the =
God of
Gods. A Shakta would say that since Shakti is responsible for the ap=
pearance
of apparent reality, then She is the God of Gods.

I say only that=
 Thou Art That, there is no Other. And this draw towards one
Form of Divini=
ty or another, or the Advaitin draw towards the Formless
Divine, is based o=
n, i.e. has its foundation in, one's Karma. And hence
one's Karma *does* dr=
ive one on, like a chariot driver. The BG contains
many, many wonderful Tru=
ths.


    PS : I'm not a Dvaitin or Visishtadvatin and I do not want to st=
art
another Dvaita v/s Advaita thread on this forum.There have been many su=
ch
threads going on on the internet without any value.  I just want more so=
lid
explanation if what you wrote is indeed true.




One does not have to =
declare oneself a dualist in order to be one, one
merely divides the "spiri=
tual realm" as something different and outside of
the material.  There is n=
o material, only the appearance thereof. There is
only That. Anything else =
is just a temporary event.

Jai Maa!
