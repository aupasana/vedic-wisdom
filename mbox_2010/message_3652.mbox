Namaste Girish,

Doing Chandipath or Chandi homam everyday is a daunting pr=
oposition for many people. Chandipath can take anywhere from one hour to 4 =
hours, depending on how familiar one is with the text.

However, several pe=
ople have learnt the text in the last few years and doing homam with it eve=
ryday. With practice, things that seemed impossible once may become easy.

=
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

Manish told me in 2006 that several people close to us from=
 previous lives are slowly coming together and about to=C2=A0 start serious=
 sadhana. He said that they will all do homam and eventually do Chandi homa=
m regularly - the chosen sadhana in this life - and make brisk progress in =
a few years of time to prepare themselves for the main task ahead. When he =
said that, I did not take him seriously. Chandi homam is considered very co=
mplex and even many professional priests do not do it daily. The idea of se=
veral people doing Chandi homam daily seemed almost impossible. Though I wa=
s quite comfortable with the text by then, I did not think at that time tha=
t even I would oneday start doing Chandi homam daily.

But, just 4 years la=
ter, it is amazing that there are several people doing Chandi homam daily. =
In my neighborhood itself, 3 people do Chandi homam daily (with 700 verses)=
. I know that several people are doing all over the world.=C2=A0 Some of th=
e people doing Chandi homam now were once ritual novices who were not even =
used to lighting a lamp or doing even minor poojas. I realize now that noth=
ing is really impossible when a rishi or a deity decides.

Do not consider =
anything impossible. If you really practice, it will become so easy.

Thoug=
h it is possible to do something else in the interim, I really think you sh=
ould practice the entire Chandipath.

*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

In the interim, one p=
ossibility is to do a homam using the beeja mantra you mentioned. Another p=
ossibility is to do using the 4th or 11th chapter only. It is possible to d=
o with Durga suktam or Devi suktam also, but my gut feeling is that you may=
 not pronounce them well. It is better for you to do with a pouraanika mant=
ra or a beeja mantra.

A homam with the Durgaa Saptashloki (7 verses select=
ed from the 700) repeated several times is an idea. Doing homam just with t=
he verse "sarva mangala maangalye...naaraayani namostu te" is also an idea =
in your case.

*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

Answers to your followup questions:

(1) The=
 sankalpa I have given in the manual can be used without modification. It w=
as designed to be generic.

(2) Either is fine. This being a pournaanika ma=
ntra, there is no need for a specific intonation. You can say "swaahaa" wit=
h any intonation or just plainly.

(3) Yes, you can use a photo of your kul=
a devata. In fact, you can do just with fire too, i.e. without an idol.

Us=
e the word "chitra" or "paTa" or "chitrapaTa" instead of "moorthi" (moortho=
u=3Dchitre or paTe or chitrapaTe when invoking, moortheh=3Dchitraat or paTa=
at or chitrapaTaat when sending off).

(4) Uploading a Chandi homam video m=
eans uploading atleast 1.5 hours of video. I do not know of any site that a=
llows that. If only the beginning is needed, that is possible. I will talk =
to Ravi and see if that can be done.

Do you live near Mumbai? If so, you c=
an perhaps visit Rajarshi and his friends who do Chandi homam regularly and=
 see it live.

Best regards,
Narasimha

      Namaskarams Narasimhaji and other =

I have been following the discussions on Aghori practices and acc=

 managed to read some portions of the Aghora series by Svoboda. While I hav=
e been doing the Ganapathi homam for the past few months as regularly as I =
can , I have always been very drawn to bhagawati / Devi upasanas. I get ver=
y emotional whenever I hear a great song/ name of the devi or see an endear=
ing image of the mother. I have to stop my tears with great effort in such =
situiations. This does not happen with any other God  /deity .



1) Does t=
his mean that Devi pooja is more suitable to me ? Or is it just my mind at =
working overtime. 



After reading the accounts there is an intense desire=
 to perform the Chandi homam. But before that I need to become comfortable =
with the Chandi recitation. That seems to be some time away considering tha=
t its an exhaustive script. While I continue to work on this path, I wanted=
 to do some kind of homam for the devi in the mean time.



2) Is it possib=
le to recite only specific portions from the Chandi for the Chandi homam in=
stead of going through the entore 700 verses?



3) Can I use some other ma=
ntras like only the Chandi Beeja mantra "om ai=C3=A0 hr=C3=A9=C3=A0 kl=C3=
=A9=C3=A0 c=C3=A4mu=C3=AB=C3=B2=C3=A4yai vicce" .



4) Alternatively can I=
 perform the homam using the Durga Suktam . Kindly let me know the procedur=
e if I am using just the Durga suktam for performing the homam.



Thanks a=
