Namaste friends,

Thanks to Rajarshi for the well-written, inspiring and ex=
cellent series on his experiences with Manish at Kashi.

Krishnendu, I can =
understand where you are coming from. However, there is one more angle to c=
onsider.

Manish told me long back that we should guard against focusing on=
 "personalities" and building awe. He said we should focus on sadhana. He s=
aid, "my message is not that I am special, but it is that everyone is speci=
al. My assertion is not that I found god, but it is that everyone can and s=
hould find god. I am a normal person. If I could find god, anybody could. A=
s people do homam sincerely and unselfishly for a few years, there will be =
many people who make great progress. World will be a changed place."

Manis=
h said, "people should do sadhana. Don't waste time when you are on earth. =
Never give the excuse that you don't know how to do sadhana. Do whatever yo=
u can. If you know how to do homam, do homam. Otherwise do japam. Or you ca=
n sit down and do a bhajan chanting god's name. Do some sadhana or the othe=
r for as much time as you can. Don't worry about the results, but keep doin=
g sadhana to the best of your ability."

*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0 *

I have personally seen clear indications that Manish operates on =
a different plane compared to most people. I will give a few small examples=
 in this writeup. However, I want to re-iterate that Manish does not see hi=
mself as a special person or a "man of god" as you say, but sees himself as=
 a small instrument of Nature.

When I mention any supernatural things invo=
lving Manish, the goal is to show that such things are possible even now an=
d not just limited to books and stories. As Rajarshi wisely said, we "educa=
ted city people" lack faith. True, skepticism is useful as a lot of fake pe=
ople do exploit the blind faith of people, but the pendulum has swung too f=
ar and educated people have lost faith so completely that it is almost cyni=
cal.

This is like lazy people of a village who do not have the energy and =
patience to climb a hill next to the village refusing to believe that anybo=
dy can climb that hill. Thus, if someone climbs the hill, finds something n=
ice on the hill and wants to inspire others to climb it, such accounts will=
 be inspiring.

The goal is to inspire and enable a group of spiritual aspi=
rants to do sadhana, become powerful instruments of Nature and end up inspi=
ring many more people. The ultimate goal is to uphold Veda dharma of rishis=
 in the world.

When we went to =
Calcutta to visit Dakshineshwar, we stayed near the Kalighat temple. We cou=
ld not find a hotel room as hotels were full and someone at a temple referr=
ed us to a nearby house that was being converted to a lodge. House owners l=
ived upstairs. We checked in our luggage downstairs. Manish told me, "we ha=
ve a rina with this couple. His wife is very sincere and spiritual. We need=
 to do something." We met his wife later and saw her horoscope. She was ind=
eed quite spiritual. She is a worshipper of Sarada Mata and Ramakrishna Par=
amahamsa and a regular visitor of Ramakrishna Mutt.

Manish showed a very t=
all wall on one side of that property and asked them, "is there a smashaan =
(cemetary) on the other side of that wall". They said no. Manish said, "hmm=
, it somehow feels like that." That person clarified then, "it is a house a=
nd not a smashaan, but this house was a small mosque several decades ago an=
d they supposedly buried several people of that large family in the backyar=
d itself." After all, Manish's "perception" was correct.

BTW, we two ended=
 up doing two simultaneous Ganapathi homas on the next night next to that w=
all.

*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *

On his advice, one lady st=
arted chanting Chandipath everyday to solve some problem with her son, whic=
h was bothering her very much.

Oneday Manish talked to her daughter. He as=
ked her, "what is your mother doing? She is doing Chandipath alright, but s=
he is asking for weird things. Check with her and ask her to stop asking th=
ose things."

When she cornered her mother on what she was asking, her moth=
er finally revealed that she was frustrated with the situation with her son=
 and so was asking Devi at the time of Chandipath to take her life so that =
she does not have to see her son's situation.

Her daughter straightened he=
r out and she stopped that. As a postscript, her son's problem was solved a=
fter she did Chandipath for a few more weeks.

*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0 *

Manish told me a few times that he "knows" when someone thi=
nks of him.

When we were staying at a hotel in Kurukshetra, Manish said to=
 me one evening, "the hotel owner is thinking of me right now. He is thinki=
ng about me and money." Interestingly, phone in the room rang in a minute a=
nd it was the hotel owner. He called to ask if we wanted to pay for the nex=
t day ahead instead of paying in the morning.

*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0 *

Manish came to Seatle, USA for a conference in fall 2005 an=
d I met him physically for the first time then. After lunch, we were walkin=
g around. Suddenly, Manish declared, "there is a rudraaksha maalaa meant fo=
r your son close to here. I can sense it. Let us go and find it." We walked=
 quite a distance. Then he said, "this is the place." There was a big count=
ry market kind of place in a small shopping complex. We went in, but found =
nothing. We came out of the complex. Manish looked around and said, "no, th=
is is the place. I was confused by the smell from the fish market inside th=
is complex. Let us try again." We went in again and this time Manish took m=
e inside a small alley and there was a small mom & pop kind of shop selling=
 some Tibetan things. They had several Rudraaksha maalaas. Manish picked on=
e, bought it and gave it for my son.

*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0 *

I mentioned this earlier. Manish told me oneday that he "saw me" doi=
ng my daily Chandi homam while he was driving fast on a highway in UK. He l=
ifted one hand in abhaya mudra (blessing pose) while driving. His wife aske=
d what he was doing. He said he told her, "Narasimha is doing homam right n=
ow. I am blessing him."

When he mentioned this, I wanted to verify it. I n=
ormally wear red or yellow or white veshti and anga vastram (lower cloth an=
d upper cloth) for my homam. That day I was wearing a blue veshti and a blu=
e T-shirt. I was gifted that blue veshti by a priest and wore it only twice=
 until now. So one is unlikely to *guess* this. I asked him, "if you saw me=
, tell me what kind of clothes I was wearing." He said, "Narasimha, it seem=
ed like some shade of blue. You were wearing a T-shirt and it was also anot=
her shade of blue." He was correct. If one was merely guessing it, the prob=
ability of getting is correct was very very small - almost zero.

When we went to Pune, Delhi and Kuruksh=
etra for the Krishna movie shooting, it rained heavily. In May, it was a bi=
t early for the monsoon rains. When we reached the temple at Mayapur, Manis=
h said that nature was pleased with the work on Krishna and rains wherever =
we went was a sign. Sometimes Manish says big-sounding things like this, wh=
ich may give an impression that he is proud. But I realized that it is not =
because of pride, but he was simply making observations from the plane he i=
s in. From where others are, they may sound weird or proud or pretentious.
=

I kind of dismissed him, "well, it could be a coincidence. It is very hot =
here right now and I see no clouds anywhere. If it rains here today, I will=
 believe your theory."

Manish seriously looked at the sky and nodded his h=
ead. Because it was too hot, we retired into our room at the accommodation =
there, unpacked our stuff and got tripod etc ready. Within ten minutes, we =
heard loud thunders. In a few minutes, there was a heavy thunderstorm that =
lasted half an hour. There were puddles of water everywhere. Manish remarke=
d, "see, it rained here also. Gods are happy with this work. This film is a=
n important work." The rest of the day and next day was perfect and we shot=
 what we wanted.

During March =
2006 Shata Chandi homam at the Kaalikambal temple in Chennai where Mother g=
ave a darshan to Manish and asked to start a homam movement, I was meditati=
ng in the garbhalaya one evening, sitting in front of Manish. We were both =
meditating on Savitri Gayatri mantra. After half hour or so, I lost normal =
awareness of my body and I felt like I was some all-pervading orange light.=
 I saw that there was a person at the center of that light, who was emiting=
 that light. When I looked closer, it was Manish. After a little time, he s=
uddenly transformed into a very famous saint from the past. I wondered "why=
 did Manish change into that saint". That disturbed my focus and my regular=
 self-awareness returned and I became aware that I was Narasimha meditating=
 in that garbhalaya and Manish was sitting in front of me. I opened my eyes=
. At the same time, Manish also opened his eyes. Without my saying anything=
, he asked "you saw me, no?" I was surprised that he
 knew it. However, wha=
t baffled me the most was why he transformed into that saint. I stuttered, =
"but...". Without my finishing it, he remarked, "you see Narasimha, the ble=
ssings of my guru of last life are still with me. That is why you saw him i=
n me!" He not only knew what I saw, but explained it succintly.

*=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *

I was sleeping oneday. In the middle of th=
e night, I woke up. When I was still on the bed and partially awake, my sha=
kti rose. In other words, my self-awareness got refined. I first perceived =
a tremendous bolt of electricity going up in my back. Then, in a split seco=
nd, my perception of that electricity changed from "shakti inside me" to "I=
 inside shakti". My changed perception was that there was a tremendous amou=
nt of shakti that was surging up like an ocean wave and encompassing everyt=
hing that was there and that I was a very tiny particle in that tremendous =
wave. Moreover, I also "heard" a specific beejaakshara being chanted togeth=
er by millions of people, who were all tiny particles in that wave. That wa=
ve reverberated with the sound of that beejaakshara and I perceived that I =
too was chanting that beejaakshara along with all. My mind was filled with =
that sound and a kind of bliss. My self-awareness was that of a tiny partic=
le filled with that sound
 and joy and nothing else. I was unaware of anyth=
ing else. Compared to my normal mental state, it was a very simple and yet =
fantastic state to be in. I was in that state for a while. Suddenly a thoug=
ht that can be loosely expressed as "Amn't I on the bed in a room? How am I=
 hearing this loud sound? Are there people in the room" came to my mind. Th=
at thought disturbed the state of my mind and my shakti came down. In other=
 words, I returned to the regular level of self-awareness and again perceiv=
ed that I was a body lying on a bed in a room. The bliss was gone and mind =
was again filled with hundreds of thoughts as usual.
=A0
I mentioned this i=
ncident a few days later to Manish. When this happened, it was the middle o=
f the night for me and morning for Manish. When I mentioned the incident an=
d said that I heard the sound of a beejaakshara reverberating in the wave i=
n which I was a small particle, Manish immediately said he knew it and also=
 mentioned the specific beejaakshara and asked "that is what you heard, rig=
ht?" That was indeed correct. Moreover, I had never meditated with that bee=
jaakshara before and it is not something one would expect me to have a myst=
ical experience with.

When I confirmed that was the beejaakshara I heard, =
Manish shed some light: "I was at that time meditating with that beejaaksha=
ra. So and so deity came and filled my consciousness. I then went into a ni=
ce samadhi. Some people close to me may also have experienced that deity at=
 that time. But we should realize that this is all Her play and we are just=
 nimittas. What she does and why she does, she knows and we do not. We are =
just dummies observing what comes our way. We neither make anything happen =
nor should we desire anything to happen. Just be and observe. Do not be att=
racted or repelled by anything."

*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=


When Manish called me in mid-2004, he told me, "You are doing good work b=
y giving free astrology software and doing several poojas, but you are not =
experiencing anything. Time has now come for your Kundalini to awaken and f=
or you to start experiencing things". I thought he was crazy. He sent me a =
Rudraaksha maalaa and asked me to do 2x108 times Gayatri mantra everyday us=
ing that maalaa while maintaining brahmacharya (celibacy) and keeping the b=
ack straight and without any body movement at all. I ignored the Rudraaksha=
 maalaa sent by him for many months before starting the practice he wanted =
in May 2005. I experienced something very intense, powerful, profound and l=
ife changing within 18 days of starting the practice.

When I mentioned wha=
t happened to him, he laughed and said, "now an irreversible transformation=
 has been kicked off". He said, "we two were born together many times. Even=
 if you think I am crazy, you cannot leave me and will be pulled towards me=
. Such is our relationship. You don't know who you are and who I am, but I =
do." He also told me then about his first phone call to me in 2004: "I did =
not have your phone number but wanted to connect with you. When I was in a =
trance after meditation, I simply picked up the phone and dialed whatever d=
igits my hand felt like pressing. Then I got you on the phone."

Though I s=
till thought he was crazy, I knew that what I had experienced was too profo=
und and the coincidence that it happened soon after starting to use his maa=
laa was too strong, to ignore. I started to wonder if he was genuine after =
all, but his manner of speaking was still too weird for me. I never hid my =
thoughts from him and shared freely.

My journey since then has been very i=
nteresting and I have shared parts of it on this yahoogroup. Someone said R=
ajarshi's mails reminded of Vimalananda. There is indeed something Vimalana=
nda-like about Manish. In fact, Manish says he is like a spiritual son to V=
imalananda and holds Vimalananda in great esteem. I don't know Vimalananda,=
 but I know Manish and I can imagine several things mentioned by Vimalanand=
a in "Aghora" series books being correct.

Despite some of his supernatural=
 abilities that I have seen, like the ability to create a specific mystical=
 experience in someone thousands of miles away, he insists that Devi does e=
verything and he is just a small instrument and an observer of Devi's leela=
a and a small player in the big game of chess being played by Devi. In fact=
, his main teaching to me was to improve devotion, faith and surrender and =
give up doership of my actions.

His teachings are sublime and yet practica=
l. He is not content to explain theory, but practically demonstrates the we=
aknesses of mind and how to overcome them. Instead of swimming in modern ps=
eudo-vedanta, he made me understand and appreciate duality and non-duality =
at the same time. He made me understand things through experience. He broug=
ht great change in my attitude and thinking in the last 5.5 years of intera=
ction. He destroyed my biases and expanded the horizons of my understanding=
 and gave a much better perspective.

Most importantly, using me as an inst=
rument, he enabled many sincere spiritual seekers to embrace the ancient Ve=
dic sadhana of rishis - homam or fire ritual for saattwik purposes. He tell=
s me that one lakh (one hundred thousand) people will be doing homam on a r=
egular basis one hundred years from now.

As I said at the beginning of thi=
s email, inspiring sadhana is more important than inspiring awe regarding s=
pecific personalities, though the latter sometimes helps with the former.

=
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *

I will conclude with Manish's wo=
rds I mentioned before:

"My message is not that I am special, but it is th=
at everyone is special. My assertion is not that I found god, but it is tha=
t everyone can and should find god. I am a normal person. If I could find g=
od, anybody could. As people do homam sincerely and unselfishly for a few y=
ears, there will be many people who make great progress. World will be a ch=
anged place."

"People should do sadhana. Don't waste time when you are on =
earth. Never give the excuse that you don't know how to do sadhana. Do what=
ever you can. If you know how to do homam, do homam. Otherwise do japam. Or=
 you can sit down and do a bhajan chanting god's name. Do some sadhana or t=
he other for as much time as you can. Don't worry about the results, but ke=
ep doing sadhana to the best of your ability."

Best regards,
Narasimha

      From time to time various sayings and incident=

some valuable materials.Will it not be nice to arc=

 her life so that she does not have to see her son's situation.<br><br>Her =

 to me one evening, "the hotel owner is thinking of me right now. He is thi=

    *       *<br><br>Manish ca=
me to Seatle, USA for a conference in fall 2005 and I met him physically fo=
r the first time then. After lunch, we were walking around. Suddenly, Manis=
h declared, "there is a rudraaksha maalaa meant for your son close to here.=
 I can sense it. Let us go and find it." We walked quite a distance. Then h=
e said, "this is the place." There was a big country market kind of place i=
n a small shopping complex. We
 went in, but found nothing. We came out of =
the complex. Manish looked around and said, "no, this is the place. I was c=
onfused by the smell from the fish market inside this complex. Let us try a=
gain." We went in again and this time Manish took me inside a small alley a=
nd there was a small mom & pop kind of shop selling some Tibetan things=
. They had several Rudraaksha maalaas. Manish picked one, bought it and gav=
e it for my son.<br><br>*       *  =
     *<br><br>I mentioned this earlier. Manish told me =
oneday that he "saw me" doing my daily Chandi homam while he was driving fa=
st on a highway in UK. He lifted one hand in abhaya mudra (blessing pose) w=
hile driving. His wife asked what he was doing. He said he told her, "Naras=
imha is doing homam right now. I am blessing him."<br><br>When he mentioned=
 this, I wanted to verify it. I normally wear red or yellow or white veshti=
 and anga vastram (lower
 cloth and upper cloth) for my homam. That day I w=
as wearing a blue veshti and a blue T-shirt. I was gifted that blue veshti =
by a priest and wore it only twice until now. So one is unlikely to *guess*=
 this. I asked him, "if you saw me, tell me what kind of clothes I was wear=
ing." He said, "Narasimha, it seemed like some shade of blue. You were wear=
ing a T-shirt and it was also another shade of blue." He was correct. If on=
e was merely guessing it, the probability of getting is correct was very ve=
ry small - almost zero.<br><br>*       * =
;      *<br><br>When we went to Pune, Delhi and Ku=
rukshetra for the Krishna movie shooting, it rained heavily. In May, it was=
 a bit early for the monsoon rains. When we reached the temple at Mayapur, =
Manish said that nature was pleased with the work on Krishna and rains wher=
ever we went was a sign. Sometimes Manish says big-sounding things like thi=
s, which may give
 an impression that he is proud. But I realized that it i=
s not because of pride, but he was simply making observations from the plan=
e he is in. From where others are, they may sound weird or proud or pretent=
ious.<br><br>I kind of dismissed him, "well, it could be a coincidence. It =
is very hot here right now and I see no clouds anywhere. If it rains here t=
oday, I will believe your theory."<br><br>Manish seriously looked at the sk=
y and nodded his head. Because it was too hot, we retired into our room at =
the accommodation there, unpacked our stuff and got tripod etc ready. Withi=
n ten minutes, we heard loud thunders. In a few minutes, there was a heavy =
thunderstorm that lasted half an hour. There were puddles of water everywhe=
re. Manish remarked, "see, it rained here also. Gods are happy with this wo=
rk. This film is an important work." The rest of the day and next day was p=
erfect and we shot what we wanted. <br><br>*     &=

 *       *<br><br>During March 2006 Sha=
ta Chandi homam at the Kaalikambal temple in Chennai where Mother gave a da=
rshan to Manish and asked to start a homam movement, I was meditating in th=
e garbhalaya one evening, sitting in front of Manish. We were both meditati=
ng on Savitri Gayatri mantra. After half hour or so, I lost normal awarenes=
s of my body and I felt like I was some all-pervading orange light. I saw t=
hat there was a person at the center of that light, who was emiting that li=
ght. When I looked closer, it was Manish. After a little time, he suddenly =
transformed into a very famous saint from the past. I wondered "why did Man=
ish change into that saint". That disturbed my focus and my regular self-aw=
areness returned and I became aware that I was Narasimha meditating in that=
 garbhalaya and Manish was sitting in front of me. I opened my eyes. At the=
 same time, Manish also opened his eyes. Without my saying anything, he
 as=
ked "you saw me, no?" I was surprised that he knew it. However, what baffle=
d me the most was why he transformed into that saint. I stuttered, "but..."=
. Without my finishing it, he remarked, "you see Narasimha, the blessings o=
f my guru of last life are still with me. That is why you saw him in me!" H=
e not only knew what I saw, but explained it succintly.<br><br>*  =
;     *       *<br><br>I =
was sleeping oneday. In the middle of the night, I woke up. When I was stil=
l on the bed and partially awake, my shakti rose. In other words, my self-a=
wareness got refined. I first perceived a tremendous bolt of electricity go=
ing up in my back. Then, in a split second, my perception of that electrici=
ty changed from "shakti inside me" to "I inside shakti". My changed percept=
ion was that there was a tremendous amount of shakti that was surging up li=
ke an ocean wave and encompassing everything that was there and
 that I was=
 a very tiny particle in that tremendous wave. Moreover, I also "heard" a s=
pecific beejaakshara being chanted together by millions of people, who were=
 all tiny particles in that wave. That wave reverberated with the sound of =
that beejaakshara and I perceived that I too was chanting that beejaakshara=
 along with all. My mind was filled with that sound and a kind of bliss. My=
 self-awareness was that of a tiny particle filled with that sound and joy =
and nothing else. I was unaware of anything else. Compared to my normal men=
tal state, it was a very simple and yet fantastic state to be in. I was in =
that state for a while. Suddenly a thought that can be loosely expressed as=
 "Amn't I on the bed in a room? How am I hearing this loud sound? Are there=
 people in the room" came to my mind. That thought disturbed the state of m=
y mind and my shakti came down. In other words, I returned to the regular l=
evel of self-awareness and again perceived that I was a
 body lying on a be=
d in a room. The bliss was gone and mind was again filled with hundreds of =
thoughts as usual.<br> <br>I mentioned this incident a few days later =
to Manish. When this happened, it was the middle of the night for me and mo=
rning for Manish. When I mentioned the incident and said that I heard the s=
ound of a beejaakshara reverberating in the wave in which I was a small par=
ticle, Manish immediately said he knew it and also mentioned the specific b=
eejaakshara and asked "that is what you heard, right?" That was indeed corr=
ect. Moreover, I had never meditated with that beejaakshara before and it i=
s not something one would expect me to have a mystical experience with.<br>=
<br>When I confirmed that was the beejaakshara I heard, Manish shed some li=
ght: "I was at that time meditating with that beejaakshara. So and so deity=
 came and filled my consciousness. I then went into a nice samadhi. Some pe=
ople close to me may also have experienced that
 deity at that time. But we=
 should realize that this is all Her play and we are just nimittas. What sh=
e does and why she does, she knows and we do not. We are just dummies obser=
ving what comes our way. We neither make anything happen nor should we desi=
re anything to happen. Just be and observe. Do not be attracted or repelled=
 by anything."<br><br>*       *  &n=
bsp;    *<br><br>When Manish called me in mid-2004, he told =
me, "You are doing good work by giving free astrology software and doing se=
veral poojas, but you are not experiencing anything. Time has now come for =
your Kundalini to awaken and for you to start experiencing things". I thoug=
ht he was crazy. He sent me a Rudraaksha maalaa and asked me to do 2x108 ti=
mes Gayatri mantra everyday using that maalaa while maintaining brahmachary=
a (celibacy) and keeping the back straight and without any body movement at=
 all. I ignored the Rudraaksha maalaa
 sent by him for many months before s=
tarting the practice he wanted in May 2005. I experienced something very in=
tense, powerful, profound and life changing within 18 days of starting the =
practice.<br><br>When I mentioned what happened to him, he laughed and said=
, "now an irreversible transformation has been kicked off". He said, "we tw=
o were born together many times. Even if you think I am crazy, you cannot l=
eave me and will be pulled towards me. Such is our relationship. You don't =
know who you are and who I am, but I do." He also told me then about his fi=
rst phone call to me in 2004: "I did not have your phone number but wanted =
to connect with you. When I was in a trance after meditation, I simply pick=
ed up the phone and dialed whatever digits my hand felt like pressing. Then=
 I got you on the phone."<br><br>Though I still thought he was crazy, I kne=
w that what I had experienced was too profound and the coincidence that it =
happened soon after starting to
 use his maalaa was too strong, to ignore. =
I started to wonder if he was genuine after all, but his manner of speaking=
 was still too weird for me. I never hid my thoughts from him and shared fr=
eely.<br><br>My journey since then has been very interesting and I have sha=
red parts of it on this yahoogroup. Someone said Rajarshi's mails reminded =
of Vimalananda. There is indeed something Vimalananda-like about Manish. In=
 fact, Manish says he is like a spiritual son to Vimalananda and holds Vima=
lananda in great esteem. I don't know Vimalananda, but I know Manish and I =
can imagine several things mentioned by Vimalananda in "Aghora" series book=
s being correct.<br><br>Despite some of his supernatural abilities that I h=
ave seen, like the ability to create a specific mystical experience in some=
one thousands of miles away, he insists that Devi does everything and he is=
 just a small instrument and an observer of Devi's leelaa and a small playe=
r in the big game of
 chess being played by Devi. In fact, his main teachin=
g to me was to improve devotion, faith and surrender and give up doership o=
f my actions.<br><br>His teachings are sublime and yet practical. He is not=
 content to explain theory, but practically demonstrates the weaknesses of =
mind and how to overcome them. Instead of swimming in modern pseudo-vedanta=
, he made me understand and appreciate duality and non-duality at the same =
time. He made me understand things through experience. He brought great cha=
nge in my attitude and thinking in the last 5.5 years of interaction. He de=
stroyed my biases and expanded the horizons of my understanding and gave a =
much better perspective.<br><br>Most importantly, using me as an instrument=
, he enabled many sincere spiritual seekers to embrace the ancient Vedic sa=
dhana of rishis - homam or fire ritual for saattwik purposes. He tells me t=
hat one lakh (one hundred thousand) people will be doing homam on a regular=
 basis one
 hundred years from now.<br><br>As I said at the beginning of th=
is email, inspiring sadhana is more important than inspiring awe regarding =
specific personalities, though the latter sometimes helps with the former.<=
br><br>*       *     =
;  *<br><br>I will conclude with Manish's words I mentioned before:<br=
><br>"My message is not that I am special, but it is that everyone is speci=
al. My assertion is not that I found god, but it is that everyone can and s=
hould find god. I am a normal person. If I could find god, anybody could. A=
s people do homam sincerely and unselfishly for a few years, there will be =
many people who make great progress. World will be a changed place."<br><br=
>"People should do sadhana. Don't waste time when you are on earth. Never g=
ive the excuse that you don't know how to do sadhana. Do whatever you can. =
If you know how to do homam, do homam. Otherwise do japam. Or you can sit d=
own
 and do a bhajan chanting god's name. Do some sadhana or the other for =
as much time as you can. Don't worry about the results, but keep doing sadh=
ana to the best of your ability."<br><br>Best regards,<br>Narasimha<br>----=
