In Sri Aurobindo's lexicon, Supermind is a level of highest individually ex=
pressible consciousness and its nature is Sat Chit Ananda. In some explanat=
ions it is equated with Vignana. However Supramental 'descent' and Supramen=
tal 'transformation' are different entities altogether which deal with desc=
ent / manifestation of that level of consciousness directly in our terrestr=
ial world and the transformation of our world of matter to express that con=
sciousness directly. These are things that have not been achieved before Sr=
i Aurobindo. In Sri Krishna's time, Sri Krishna established in earth a leve=
l of consciousness which Sri Aurobindo called Overmind which is one level l=
ower than Supermind. Each Avatar established a level of consciousness for w=
hich earth was suited for at that time. Now thanks to all the work of past =
Masters, earth is suited for Supramental transformation.

It should be note=
d that Mother and Sri Aurobindo are not talking about individual realizatio=
ns as they themselves realized the highest consciousness and which they sai=
d few/several other being have also realized. *** They are talking about es=
tablishing it in collective terrestrial consciousness. *** This is one plac=
e where people often go wrong. While Ramana Maharishi and other Masters sho=
wed the path for individually attaining the highest consciousness and 'esca=
ping' the world of untruth, Sri Aurobindo's focus is to transform the world=
 of untruth (or veiled truth) to a world of truth at a collective level and=
 not individual realization of highest concisousness. In Sri Aurobindo's pa=
th individual realization is a side effect and a pre-requisite for the fina=
l goal, while in the path of most other Masters individual realization is t=
he final goal.

Supramental transformation  is something new for which foun=
dation has been laid out by various Rishis and Avatara purushas (not just S=
ri Aurobindo and the Mother, though they were / are at the forefront and le=
ading the effort) for past several millenniums. It is a new realization / h=
appening which is not explained clearly in any old scripture. However as pe=
r Sri Aurobindo Vedas do contain seeds of it in a hidden form and Vedic Ris=
his did have the experiences of Supramental descent but the world and human=
ity is only ready now for the full and irreversible Supramental transformat=
ion.

India's spiritual awakening, the establishment of one world family in=
 the form of union of governments, reawakening of Asia, collective human un=
ity, etc., are several stages in that long goal. 

It is happening slowly i=
n front of our very eyes and may take several more centuries or even few mi=
llenniums to fully establish itself. One of the consequences will be a radi=
al evolution of humanity, much more radical and profound than what happened=
 when we evolved from Apes to humans (simplistically speaking). As per the =
Mother and Sri Aurobindo, the body of the new beings that have realized sup=
ramental transformation in their matter will be a body of light and as such=
 is not subject to laws of nature that we are aware of now. Those bodies of=
 light can be prolonged as much as needed or modified into another form wit=
hout the soul having to leave it and take birth in another form as it is ha=
ppening today. What I put above is only a crude way of putting it and does =
not do justice to the topic. For lack of better vocabulary this was called =
physical immortality which several people have misunderstood, even though S=
ri Aurobindo himself made jokes about it.. He said something to the effect =
that wouldnt it be very boring to use the same raincoat for 500 years? 

Bu=
t human mind being what it is, it distorts what Sri Aurobindo and the Mothe=
r spoke about.

To explain it in a few pages or even several pages is diffi=
cult or even impossible as even the concept is very new and our mind will c=
onfuse it with some other thing we already know. Several yogis even god rea=
lized ones have made the mistake of confusing Sri Aurobindo's message. As o=
f now, I am not qualified enough to summarize what Sri Aurobindo and the Mo=
ther meant by Supramental descent. 

The best one can do is to surrender to=
 Divine Mother and read Life Divine, Savitri and the Agenda (all 13 volumes=
). Understanding it is not a function of one's intelligence. It is a blessi=
ng / Grace. A less intelligent person may understand correctly while a grea=
t intellectual mind might misunderstand it.

If reading these voluminous te=
xts is difficult, one can start with the simpler works of the famous yogi &=
 scholar M.P. Pandit (who was Mother's secretary and custodian of the Ashra=
m after Mother's Mahasamadhi). Another excellent choice would be Satprem's =
writings. Especially his book "Sri Aurobindo or Adventure of Consciousness"=
 is a classic. It is said that most of the writings of the book was inspire=
d by Sri Aurobindo himself and Satprem was merely writing down what came to=
 him with the Mother correcting him as necessary.

 In my limited reading, =
I haven't come across any other work which so clearly and lucidly explains =
various layers of consciousness and a classic introduction to anyone who wa=
nts to comprehend or follow Sri Aurobindo's message. One could have read Yo=
ga Vaashistam and may still find that there is lot to learn from the book "=
Sri Aurobindo or the Adventure of Consciousness". One of the very direct be=
nefit of reading that book is that our awareness grows by leaps and bounds =
just by assimilating the knowledge in that book. We being to observe things=
 which we did not even see before.

Best regards,
-Shiva.

 "The change of consciousness is a necessary thing and without it there cou=

 possible, if the body remains as it is, a slave of death, disease, decay, =
pain, unconsciousness and all the other results of ignorance. If these are =

 of consciousness which would mean mental - spiritual union with the Divine=

mental Descent is necessary for the dynamic action of the Truth in mind, vi=
tal and body. This would imply as=C2=A0a final result the disappearence of =
the unconsciousness of the body; it would no longer be subject to death or =
disease. That would mean it would not be subject to ordinary processes by w=
