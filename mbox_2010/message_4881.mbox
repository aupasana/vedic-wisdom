Namaste,

but also the ultimate samadi
=C2=A0
I just have to disagree=
 with it, at least until I can find even one sadhaka who 
has experienced t=

who v=
ouch by the Kunjika can hardly actually use it in real life to any=C2=A0aff=

I have had the good fortune of meeting some people who have lots of m=

tantric kriyas. Many of them vouch for the Kunjika, bu=
t not even one can 
actually use it to bring any effect. When coming to pra=

they need to take help of other things.
=C2=A0
=C2=
=A0and other things what i like to add is practising kunjika as a sadna wil=
l give 
the sum total of all results got by practising different parts of s=
aptashati and 
much more. 

=C2=A0
The Kunjika was added to the saptasati m=
uch later. Rishi Markendeya never added 
the same. Just like the Argala, Ke=
elakam, and Kavacham. Kunjika has its's uses 
but it cannot be said to be e=
qual to Saptasati which is what Rishi Markandeya 
had actually given.
=C2=
=A0
=C2=A0
Further i feel it contains some key without which the mere sadna=
 of saptashati 
cannot be able to fully get the results that saptashati con=
tains :-)
=C2=A0
This is positively incorrect. Lot of people have attain ex=
ceptional results and 
highest states of consciousness only with the Saptas=
ati. Sadhakas from Bengal 
and Assam region - which=C2=A0has for centuries =
been=C2=A0one of hearts of Chandi worship 
apart from Rajasthan=C2=A0- have=
 hardly ever used the Kunjika and attained the 
highest possible results in=
 terms of both samadhi and siddhi. Too much stress on 
Kunjika is mostly a =
North=C2=A0Indian =C2=A0phenomenon. It could very well be a corruption 
tha=
t has creeped in over ages. Just like in some parts of Bihar and North no o=
ne 
ever does a havan without checking "agnivaas", which is again a corrupt=
ion. 

=C2=A0
=C2=A0so i trust fully on words of shiva when he says kunjika=
 on its own gives the 
full results of saptashati and also saptashati witho=
ut kunjika cannot give 
complete results 


Well, it is good to trust the w=
ords of Shiva but sometimes over centuries=C2=A0people 
have added their ow=
n words in the name of deities.=C2=A0=C2=A0Finally, the proof of the 
puddi=
ng is in eating it. I did not find Kunjika of any much use or effect, 
defi=
nitely not even a fraction of the effects of the actual Chandipath, thus I =

do not recommend it to anybody. Thats's just my opinion-:)

My take is=

various sadna of various shakti it is not only for normal siddhis but

 the ultimate samadi and other things what i like to add is practising
