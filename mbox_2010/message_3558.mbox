Namaste,

(1) Atharva seersham is nice, but there are many other mantras. What is the mantra you were doing for 2 years?

(2) You can try the other homam (e.g. Chandi homam, Krishna homam etc) on weekends or other convenient days, while continuing to do Ganapathi homam on other days. Once you feel comfortable with the new homam procedure, you can switch completely.

(3) I did not try to "measure the spiritual progress" in my Jyotish research articles that you referred to. I took specific events in the lives of some natives and analyzed their timing astrologically.

Spiritual experiences are important events in spiritual life and may be analyzed astrologically, though they cannot accurately capture the progress.

Let me give a simple analogy. Suppose someone is going from Kanyakumari (at the souther tip of India) to Kashmir (northern tip of India). Crossing Hyderabad city, crossing Bhopal city, crossing Delhi city etc are important milestones on the way. But they do not accurately measure the progress. One person may reach Delhi fast, then get lost, go east instead of north and never reach Kashmir. Another person may go slowly from Kanyakumari to Chennai but then take a flight to Srinagar and reach Kashmir very quickly. The cities one has reached so far do not capture one's progress given that there are many paths through many cities and many transportation methods.

(4) One's guru comes into one's life when the time comes. Do not worry about Guru droha etc. Just do your best and do NOT worry that your best may not be sufficient. There is no point in such negative thinking.

As far as homam is concerned, one can think of me (or Manish) as guru and perform homam. Do homam to the best of your ability based on the manuals and surrender the result to the Lord. As more people do it, it will strengthen Veda dharma in the world. A drop may be too small compared to ocean, but ocean is made of drops.

Of course, Nature will also do good to those who help increase Veda dharma in the world. But do homam without expecting any specific results and leave it to Nature to decide how to do good to you. The Mother knows what is best for you, much more than you may know. If you do homam with that attitude and some mistakes - physical or mental - happen in the beginning, I am willing to take responsibility for it and take any punishment if needed. I do it voluntarily.

*        *        *

The only tip I can give is: Keep doing sadhana. Don't allow negative emotions like guilt. Make your best effort and then accept what happens. Past is water under the bright and future has not come yet. Focus on what you can do now and do it sincerely.

Feelings of pride and guilt are equally bad and not productive. Do not feel proud when you manage to do and do not feel guilty when you fail to do.

*        *        *

Spiritual sadhakas may go through phases. One may encounter phases of great inspiration and effort, phases of complacency, phases of slowness and sluggishness, phases of self-doubt and questions, phases of disillusionment etc in different orders.

Take the monastic disciples of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa for example. According to Ramakrishna, these were all elevated souls who are born together from time to time to accomplish important missions. They lived with Ramakrishna for a few years before he left, saw him closely and were affected by his personality and teachings deeply. Yet, most of them went through phases of disillusionment and confusion later on. In the early years of their coming together, several of them wondered if they should just listen to their parents, leave that place, go back to their parents and lead "regular" lives.

Still, some force kept them together and the mutt established by them later directly or indirectly touched the spiritual lives of so many people. Even the homam manuals that are being used by many people today have their base *primarily* in a book published by Ramakrishna Mutt, though I perused multiple sources. Several vedanta texts that inspired me and many others came from Ramakrishna mutt. Their books on Vedic chants inspired me and many others to learn and practice so many Vedic chants. So many people were initiated into Sanatana dharma, vedanta etc through Ramakrishna mutt. If the great yogis who were behind that institution were also once afflicted by self-doubts, confusion and disillusionment, what to say of us?

There is no magic elixir to eliminate all these phases and take one to the final goal directly. One has to go through all the struggle that one has to go through.

All I can say is that one should keep walking the walk, without looking back or looking ahead. Do sadhana. Depending on your previous conditioning, you will make progress sometime or the other.

Best regards,
Narasimha
