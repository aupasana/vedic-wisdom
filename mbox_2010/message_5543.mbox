namaste,

The total time taken for this post including lookup, correction o=
f OCR and transliteration - 25 minutes. I suggest Sri.Narasimha forward thi=
s for opinion of "Heads of Departments of Sanskrit" in India or elsewhere i=
ncluding the universities on the East coast.

the word lakShmI is an exampl=
e of an exception to general pattern of declensions of i I ending words. Si=
r Monier Wiliams has made a special note of this i. These are according to =
the rules of pANiNI's ashThadhyAyI and has been mentioned in Whitney too.

=
Sanskrit words have generically 
(a) a general pattern (according to pAniNi=
ya rules)
(b)exceptions for some specific words (these too are recorded by =
pANiNI
(c) exceptions in veda mantra for certain words (these too are recor=
ded by pANiNI - and other grammarians including shri vopadeva, sayana, halA=
yudha etc. 

nevertheless the dhAtu is "lakSh" that has meaning aim and obj=
ective - It is possible that shri - Narasimha has not considered the except=
ions - And perhaps he may like to recall these from memory in childhood or =
look up proper references.

124. A few primitively feminine words not monos=
yllabic, such as [iakShmI] 'the goddess of prosperity,' [tanvI]', 'a lute-s=
tring,' [tarI], 'a boat,' like [shrI], take [s] in the Nom. sing., but in o=
ther respects follow [nadI] ; thus, 
N. [lakShmIs], [lakShmyau],[lakShmyas]=
; 
Ac. [lakShmIm], &c. 
V. [lakShmi].

Obs. Analogously in the Veda [vRukI]=
 'a she-wolf (Rig-v. 1. 117, 18), and (according to some authorities)  {siM=
hI], 'a lioness,' make N. sing, [vRukIs], [siMhIs] . But [gaurI], f. 'the b=
rilliant (goddess), as a derivative fem. noun, is N.sig. [gaurI].
=3D=3D=3D=
=3D

105. Feminine stems in [A] and [I] , like[shivA]i, f. *the wife of S'i=
va,^ or as an adjective, 'prosperous,' and [ nadi], f. 'a river'
Their decl=
ension is exhibited side by side that their analogy may be more easily perc=
eived.

In [shivA]  the final of the stem is changed to [e] in I. sing., G.=
 L. du. ; [yA] is inserted in D. Ab. G. L. sing. ; and [ni] in G. pi. Hence=
 the inflective stems [shivA, shiive]. In [nadi the final is changed to [y]=
 before the vowel-terminations by 34 ; [A] is in-
serted in D. Ab. G. L. si=
ng. ; and [n] in G. pl. ; in V. sing, the final of the stem is shortened.

=
junction of stem with termination: 
N. sing, [s] rejected; 
N. du. [shivA] =
+ [I] =3D [shive] by 32 ; N. pl. [shivA] + [as]=3D [sivAs] by 31 ;
I. sing,=
 [shive] + [A]=3D[shivAya] by 36.a.
D. sing. [shivA] + ya + e =3D [shivAyai=
]
by 33 ; 
G. L. du. [shive] + [os]=3D [shivos] by 36. a. 
D. sing, [nadi] =
+[A] + e=3D[nadyai] by 34 and 33. ;
 L. pl. [nadI] + [su] =3D [nadIshu] by =
70.

N nadI, nadyau, nadyas
Ac.nadIm , nadyau, nadIs
I. nadyA, nadIbhyAm, n=
adIbhis
D. nadyai, nadIbhyAm, nadIbhyas
Ab. [nadyAs], [nadIbhyAm], [nadIbhy=
as]
G. [nadyAs], [nadyos], [nadIShu]
V. [nadi], [nadyau], [nadyas]

Obs.1. =
The Vedic 
I sing. may be [shivA]  for [shiivAya]
D. sing. for [shivai] for=
 [[shivAyai]
N. pl. [shivasas], 
G.pl. [shivAm]

Obs. 2. The vedic N.pl of =
nouns in [I] may end in [Is] eg.[nadIs] for [nadyas]
