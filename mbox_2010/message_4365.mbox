  Namaste,
    First of all I would like to thank guru's Narasimha garu =
and Pt
Manish-ji for spreading out the divine message of performing homaMs =
and
the essential's of sadhana.


      Please forgive me for the long mail=
...

      I always had a wish to start doing homaM's after joining the gro=
up,
but I stay in a rented house and was feared about the consequences that=

I need to face from neighbors and the landlord (it's a closely
packed hous=
e with very less ventilation) but somehow dared and started
doing gaNapati =
homaM daily since a month and a half, no issues yet by
his divine grace but=
 of course need more of that to destroy the enemies
inside.

    I am plann=
ing to shift to chanDii homaM after I complete 108 of
gaNapati homaMs.

   =
 I just wanted to ask some questions and take opinion's on the
following ma=
tters, some of them might have already been answered on the
group, providin=
g a reference link would be of great help in that case :-
    1. Most often=
 the attention is drawn towards the fire while
meditating after pUrNaahuti,=
 is it okay to meditate keeping the eyes
open and with some focus on fire?
=
    2. Many of a time's i lose track of how many beeja mantras/veda
mantras=
 i am offering and offer more than 12/less than 25, is that
acceptable?
   =
 3. When running out of time I read atharvashIrShaM only once, will
that be=
 acceptable?
    4. I end up doing homaMs at night most of the times becaus=
e of issues
in getting up early in mornings as I stay late to take conferen=
ce calls
etc...
    5. I reserved a room to do homaMs, I was doing homaMs e=
ven when my
wife was on her periods (she does not enter the homaM room duri=
ng those
times). Will that be okay or I need to give a break to homaM durin=
g
those times?
    6. I am one of the guys who never did lit a lamp in my l=
ife time till
month and a half back, I stopped doing sandhyavandanaM 23 yea=
rs back, is
it mandatory to perform sandhyavandanaM to do homaM's?
    7. T=
here were some rats at home (I think 5 of them, that are very
large sized, =
but are not bandicoots), all of them died after I started
homaM's [:(] , by=
 the way I never wished that (but killed a couple of
them long back, but di=
d not try killing other's even after getting a
chance since an year), is th=
at a bad sign of doing something wrong at
homaM? Sometimes I feel the smoke=
 has killed them (i do homaM with dry
coconut, but offered large fruits lik=
e apple etc... a couple of times in
pUrNaahuti which generated a lot of smo=
ke), but then other creatures
like lizards, spiders, ants are okay.

  Than=
k You,

sarma.
