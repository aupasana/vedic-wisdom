 It was some time during the early forties. Sri Bhagavan showed symptoms of=

slight jaundice and was growing weaker and weaker every day avoiding
medic=
ation. Devotees implored him to have some treatment but without
success. So=
me of us prayed and a few others were silently doing
circumambulation round=
 the Hall in which Sri Bhagavan was seated. Major
Chadwick was prominent am=
ong those beseeching Sri Bhagavan to take some
medicine.

One day while I w=
as just starting from home to my office in Madras, the
postman handed me a =
letter. It was from Mr. Chadwick.

The letter I recollect read like this:

=
=E2=80=9CDear T. P. R. I am sorry to tell you of the declining health of Sr=
i
Bhagavan who is growing weaker day by day, and will do nothing to allevia=
te
it. He will not take any medicines, or heed our requests and persuasions=
. It
is misery to be seeing this. Today just a thought came to me. You know=
 that
Sri Bhagavan always avoids medicines, but all the same he does not re=
ject
ayurvedic preparations like =E2=80=98black halwa=E2=80=99 (lehiyam) wh=
ich if offered he may
be pleased to accept. So why don=E2=80=99t you go to =
some ayurvedic expert or
pharmacy and ask for something, mentioning the sym=
ptoms and conditions and
send it to him (to the Ashram).If it is your good =
karma he may be pleased to
take it. But don=E2=80=99t say I wrote to you or=
 expressed concern. You can say that
by chance you met so and so and found =
a lehiyam well prepared which is good
for many things and that it is only a=
 tonic and not a medicine, etc. I shall
expect your immediate response.=E2=
=80=9D

On reading this letter, I went straight to the Venkataramana Dispen=
sary in
Mylapore before going to court, and meeting the senior physician in=
 charge
there narrated the symptoms without disclosing the identity of the =
person
for whom it was meant. I requested him to prescribe and give somethi=
ng
helpful.

I purchased one pound of the lehiyam and went to my office. Re=
taining a
small part with me, I packed the rest and sent it to Sri
Niranjan=
anandaswami, the then sarvadhikari, with a lettersaying:

=E2=80=9CDear Sri=
 Chinnaswamigal, Today as I was passing through Mylapore I peeped
into the =
Venkataramana Dispensary where a fresh lehiyam was being prepared
and ready=
 for sale,
called Jiragavilvadi lehiyam. I felt impelled to buy it and did =
so.It is so
sweet and good that retaining a portion for me, I have sent the=
 rest to you
which I request you may place before Sri Bhagavan as any other=
 offering is
done. This is not medicine
but belongs to the class of tonics =
generally taken by all.=E2=80=9D

Sri Chinnaswami accordingly appears to ha=
ve placed both the parcel and the
letter before Sri Bhagavan.

I felt elate=
d and happy at the success of Mr. Chadwick=E2=80=99s scheme and sat down
be=
fore Sri Bhagavan. Within half a minute Sri Bhagavan asked, =E2=80=9CWhat? =
Did
anyone write to you to send this?=E2=80=9D I immediately admitted it an=
d said: =E2=80=9CYes
Bhagavan,Chadwick wrote to me all that I have said in =
my letter, and my
expectations and hope also being the same, I did what he =
asked me to do and
faithfully wrote to Chinnaswamigal without even
mentioni=
ng his letter as if all this was my own initiative.=E2=80=9D

Sri Bhagavan =
laughed graciously saying, =E2=80=9CSee that, see that!=E2=80=9D

That even=
ing Chadwick entered the hall at 4 p.m. as was his routine,
inwardly also e=
lated and happy. But hardly did he rise from his obeisance
when Sri Bhagava=
n said: =E2=80=9CChadwick! Did you write anything?=E2=80=9D This was a
mome=
nt of shock and surprise for Chadwick and he having done all this out of
hi=
s extreme love and devotion to Sri Bhagavan, happily declared:=E2=80=9CYes
=
Bhagavan, I wrote all that to T. P. R. What can we do? Sri Bhagavan never
w=
ill take anything and it was miserable for us devotees to be witnessing Sri=

Bhagavan growing weaker day by day. So I did all that and I am happy now.=
=E2=80=9D

He resumed his seat and began to meditate as usual. Such was Cha=
dwick=E2=80=99s
devotion and love to Sri Bhagavan! He was one among the man=
y old devotees
whose devotion to him was boundless.
