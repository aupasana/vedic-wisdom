Hello:

I think that even modern western physics would acknowledge that tim=
e itself has geography and is not simply a steady state. Therefore choosing=
 different times for meditation may make a difference. I have not heard tha=
t full moon meditation is particularly useful. 

Under western astrology, t=
here are certain planetary aspects that enhance various activities. These v=
ary according to the planets and angles involved. Meditation may fall into =
this category. Again, these times may or may not have to do with full moon =
cycles. 

Whether the masses are becoming less spiritual is not something t=
o which I can attest, yet I believe that belief in the religion of science,=
 as epitomied by Scientific American, helps to lessen modern people's belie=
f in traditional ways. The publishers of that magazine have an agenda, whic=
h is to diminish people's belief in traditions and to separate them from li=
ving according to traditional calendars and schemes of time. 

Regards, Jac=

I have read the advice of many spiritua=
l masters and other seers say that an full moon meditation is very benefici=
al . Also related to this is the question of how do planets really affect u=
s , Vimalananda in the aghora books says it is through the rasa or food tha=
t is ingested by us. 



I know science does not yet possess the right tool=
s to measure this phenomena and einstein's grand search for a unified filed=
 theory and the universal particle is still ongoing and might take ages for=
 modern science to understand the workings of even a commonplace phenomena =
like gravitation.



However a simple test like admission rates in a mental=
 aslyum should hold up to proof if the moon is truly having a effect on hum=
ans.

elation. ..also there have been many studies in the past some for and some =
against this correlation effect but none of them found a strong evidence...=
. And always there is the risk of mistaking correlation as causation in any=
 experiment.



It is just out of curiosity that am asking this question...=
Does astrology matter at all for a serious sadhaka. Can not any day /time o=

ersonal why should one even consider the nava grahas in the ritual worship.=
 I increasingly find that astrology is only serving to discourage the masse=
s rather than pointing them in the direction of worship of divinity. 



Ho=
