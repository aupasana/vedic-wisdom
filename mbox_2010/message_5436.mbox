Namaste,

I remembered a very self critical and ruthless proverb used in G=
ujarati
which goes like this: "Kapadama badhaJ naga hoy chhe!" which means
=
"Everybody is naked inside their clothing"

Yes! very important and very ti=
mely message came our from my Guruji. I
would also do well to remember this=
 message and try to integrate in my
day to day life.

>Apne ko kya lena den=
a.... I humbly suggest that our critical abilities
should not be wasted on =
people and things that we do not have a
responsibility to change. Critical =
abilities should be directed inward
to critique oneself, towards people one=
 has a responsibility towards,
such as one's sishyas, and towards things wh=
ere one has a duty to
accomplish something. Why criticize other people? <

=
Buraa dhundhan main chalaa, Buraa naa miliyaa koi |

Apane andar jhaanka ja=
b, Mujhase buraa naa koi ||

Warm Regards,

Utpal
