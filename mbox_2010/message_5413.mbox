PVR garu, although I got the point of praying one god only but still a litt=
le 
confused. Which option would you kindly suggest from these?

Should we =
perform specific diety puja on festive days or 
stick to our ishta devta ho=
mam irrelevant of what festival it is or
do homam for both gods on festival=
 days? 

Kindly guide

Thanks and regards,
Priya

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Vaastu homam and worshipping many form=
s

=C2=A0 
Namaste,

Vaastu purusha is worshipped for specific purposes and=
 is not a genetic deity 
who could give various kinds of material and spiri=
tual results (like Vishnu, 
Shiva, Ganapathi, Lakshmi, Chandi, Hanuman etc)=
. Our purpose is to show people a 
way to reaching god through worshipping =
different forms in fire.

There are some more forms that still need to be a=
dded, like Subrahmanya, Lalita, 
Rama, Narasimha, Grahas, Ayyappa, Saraswat=
i, Hayagriva, Purusha etc. God 
willing, more manuals will become available=
 later. At this time, several people 
have found some deity they like and a=
re doing homam as a sadhana. This first 
batch of people will make some pro=
gress and inspire another batch of people in 
the coming years. We will pro=
bably need more options then.

Yes, different forms exist because people wi=
th different gunas like forms with 
different gunas. But, getting close to =
one form requires focus on it. For one's 
thoughts to be focused on a form =
most of the times, for one's mind to be 
reverberating with a mantra most o=
f the times and for one's mind to be filled 
with a form most of the times,=
 one needs to do sadhana with one form. If one 
keeps switching from one fo=
rm to another form, all those forms remain in the 
periphery of one's mind =
and none of them takes over the mind.

There are many valid paths to climbi=
ng a mountain. But, one who keeps going 
around the mountain enjoying the v=
iews offered by different paths to the top, 
may never reach top. One who i=
nstead picks one path and keeps walking may reach 
the top. Once one reache=
s the top, one can, of course, see all paths from there 
and appreciate all=
 paths. An Adi Shankara, as you said, may extoll various 
deities after rea=
ching god with one form.

As Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said in this matter, y=
ou need to dig in one place if 
you want to find water. Digging one meter h=
ere, one meter there and one meter 
elsewhere, is unproductive.

If there i=
s a strong desire to worship many forms and if sticking to one form 
seems =
binding, perhaps one is not ready for sticking to one form.

After all, som=
e people are not born to find water or reach the top of the 
mountain. They=
 are born to go around the mountain and enjoy various views. That 
is fine =
too. But, when we advise, we advise people for the best case.

Best regards=
,
Narasimha
