Namaste....

I believe that making offerings after every shloka reduces som=
e of the likelihood of physical symptoms becoming a problem. Otherwise it s=
eems as though all my body tissues become the offering. And leaves me feeli=
ng a bit crazy. The prasad is medicine.

was hesitant to write about it, but decided to go ahead as it might help pu=

e-mindedly as a brahmachari, having given up other secular studies. Those d=
ays I used to live mostly in the company of brahmacharis and sanyasis. Some=
 of my co-sadhakas of those days went on to become fully ordained monks lat=
er. Swadhyaya, yogabhyasa and occasional tirthayatras formed the mainstay o=
f my sadhana at this time. Somewhere towards the second half of this period=
 I started doing Devi Mahatmya parayana on my own without any initiation. T=
hings were fine and I made some progress probably owing to a combination of=
 many factors. After spending three years in spiritual studies and sadhana,=
 I decided to return home and pursue medical studies in accordance with my =
mother's wish. However I continued with my sadhana whilst pursuing my medic=
al studies too.
> > 
> > Around early 95, I started doing Devi Mahatmya par=
ayana with *more* vigour. Within a month I started having piercing headache=
s, my body would be quite hot to touch and my blood pressure would shoot up=
 to around 150/110 on and off. After conducting the standard investigations=
, Dr. Rao from the Dept of Medicine, who had already taken a liking to me, =
suspected that it *might* have something to do with my sadhanas too. Things=
 continued to be the same for some more months, till I got introduced to Sw=
ami Sachchidananda in what seemed to be a chance meeting. During the course=
 of conversation Swamiji asked me to meet him alone the next day after comi=
ng to know about my practice of the Devi mahatmya parayana. After interacti=
ng everyday for a week Swamiji initiated me properly into Sri Sri Chandi pa=
th.  After a week or so after the initiation all the symptoms subsided. The=
 blood pressure, jwara and headaches, all normalized. It has been around 15=
 years since then and none of the symptoms have recurred. What's more, I ha=
d some very powerful internal experiences in quick succession during the fo=
llowing week itself after initiation. This is my experience.

iated to chant a stotra or dhyanam. The case is not the same with most mant=
ras. Mantras containing bijaksharas, agamic mantras, mantras of Mahavidyas =
etc need initiation. This is the traditional view. Mantras from the Veda Sa=
mhita are not the same as these other mantras that need initiation, which a=
re generally referred to as Agamic/Tantrik mantras. Whatever you call these=
 mantras the actual idea is that these mantras are integral parts of larger=
 and distinct spiritual specialities that need initiation, as in the case o=

> > > >

> > > =

that has an independent status by itself as part of a Mahavidya. It is simu=

 of Sri Sri Chandi path***. Thus tradition holds that one needs to be initi=
ated to chant it. However if one wishes to benefit from the Yoga-Vedanta or=
 Sacred myth aspects of the Devi Mahatmyam, , reading the sacred myth in th=
e vernacular has been recommended in my write-up, as chanting the original =
along with the navakshari  amounts to practicing the sadhana of a Mahavidya=
. In that case it is recommended to be initiated and go through the special=
ised sadhanas properly under guidance.
> > > >  
> > > > 8.	Arguably if an =
uninitiated person reads the Devi Mahatmyam in the original Sanskrit as par=
t of the *Pauranik* approach and not as a Mahavidya, it has an inherent pro=
blem in our times.  The problem with attempting to do a parayana of Devi Ma=
hatmyam from texts alone (without initiation) is that most readers inadvert=
ently end up also chanting the Navarna mantra or stotras such as the Siddha=
kunjika stotram which too contain the bijaksharas.
> > > >  
> > > > 9.	I y=
ou carefully peruse my write-up on the Devi Mahatmyam, forget translating, =
nowhere do I put down the Navarna mantra even in writing. Neither have I at=
tempted to write a commentary on it. Translations of mantras do not have th=
e power of the original mantra as Sabda or Vak. However it is recommended t=
o know the essence or import (artha) of the mantra and its sadhana while ch=
anting it. Infact `artha' is the import, the essence of `Vak', not a transl=
ation! 
> > > >

 path without initiation, there is no need to worry or be confused. There h=
as to be a certain level of samskara to be attracted to Sri Sri Chandi path=
 itself. We all have it. Otherwise we would not be doing it (initiation or =
no initiation). Please keep doing whatever you are doing. Just be cautious =
not to do sakama sadhana. As Narasimha garu has rightly pointed out it is b=
etter to just do the sadhana WITHOUT asking for any favours or results. Tha=
t attitude itself will reduce a lot of the potential problem. Things will h=
appen on their own accord in the natural flow. Leave the rest to the compas=
sionate Goddess.
