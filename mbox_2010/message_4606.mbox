Hi Everyone, 

I am really happy to inform you all that we performed Sri Vi=
shnu Homam at my Friend's place recently. One of my friends bought a house =
recently and wanted me to perform Ganapathi Homam and Sudarsana Homam. But =
since I did not know how to do a Sudarsana homam and more over I was not in=
clined to get details on Sudarsana homam since it was discussed by Shri Nar=
asimha here before as a homam for a weapon, I prefered to do a more satvik =
homam like VishnuHomam and suggested the same. They agreed and we first did=
 a Ganapathi Homam and then proceeded to do a Vishnu Homam after a short br=
eak. Indeed it was a great experience that while reciting Vishnu Sahasranam=
am and offering Ahutis, the fire has risen really nicely (almost upto a foo=
t and half in height with just three dry coconut-halves and it was a wonder=
ful sight). This is very similar to Satyanarayana vratam that we offer ahut=
is to navagrahas, do the regular dikpalaka pooja etc. Except for the 'Panch=
a Loka Palaka Pooja' and the five stories after the vratam, I find that in =
Vishnu homam, all the essentials are still covered. I find that this Homam =
is a good substitute (and takes lesser time) than Satyanarayana Vratam, if =
one is falling short of time! Am I right, Sri Narasimha?
