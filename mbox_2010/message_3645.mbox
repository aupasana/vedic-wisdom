Dear KK,
=C2=A0
Nice question. I was also thinking that.
=C2=A0
Few days ba=
ck when I went to Calcutta, (where fish is the staple diet), one person tol=
d me confidently that there is no harm in eating fish or meat because Swami=
ji used to do so, and in a Bengali book on the=C2=A0life of Sri Ramakrishna=
 there is one example mentioned where a man came to ask him if should quite=
 non veg food, and supposedly Ramakrishna said first leave "Kamini" and "Ka=
nchana", then think of food. =C2=A0Also a similar examples was quoted to me=
 from=C2=A0the life of Ma Sarada where - a certain book says - she advised =
an ordinary devotee against leaving fish eating and rather just focus mind =
on God.
=C2=A0
When I tried to reason with them that if these people were t=
o come back again on planet earth they may not recommend non veg eating - c=
onsidering the state of the world today - I=C2=A0 was catergorically told t=
hey are all Trikalagyas, so if there is something wrong in eating fish they=
 would have told right then.=C2=A0 
=C2=A0
Then I tried to say that the exa=
mples maybe specific individual cases, to which I was told, "no", because b=
ased on a whole plethora of such examples even today the monks of the Ramak=
rishna Order in West Bengal eat and serve fish. This statement is a fact. I=
=C2=A0have had fish meals as prasad in many Ramakrishna Missions across=C2=
=A0West Bengal.=C2=A0So, I was told, the monks of the Ramakrishna Oder know=
 about teachings of Ramakrishna and Ma Sarada better than us ordrinary peop=
le. 
=C2=A0
I could make no further arguments and of course had a harrowing=
 time at home trying to convince my parents that I have quit non veg food. =

=C2=A0
A lot of Bengalis may not have been able to implement the basic tea=
chings of Ramakrishna in their lives, however they faithfully follow fish e=
ating as a sanction given by "Thakur" and "Sri Sri Ma" and "Swamiji".
=C2=

Dear KK,

Correction in my earlier message =E2=80=93 It =
should read `Aghora, at the left hand of God'

A sincere suggestion from me=
- No need to address me with `Ji' suffix. However, you are free to address =
me as you feel like and I'll happily accept it hence forth.

I just came ac=
ross Vimalananda' s thought on Karma. He says (and Narasimha has many a tim=
es repeated) that Karma is only generated (Binding to one) when one self-id=
entifies with it.
Although, it may seem easy to understand intellectually, =
the state is multiple times difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, it's an ext=
remely important statement to answer our queries.

Important information ab=
out Vimalananda which I came to know only yesterday is that he was a big ti=
me smoker and there was not a single day passed in his life when he didn't =
do smoking except on the final day of his departure from physical body. He =
used to as well `chew Tobacco' frequently and occasionally ate meat. I gave=
 this information, because as you pointed out (and I also agree) that it is=
 an interesting coincidence of exact thoughts crossing our minds. Further, =
please also note an important thing. The Aghori used to say very frequently=
 to all his audience to do what he says and not try to do what he does.

No=
w whatever I wrote above seems sufficient to answer the questions you asked=
. Let me put in my thoughts further (Mind you, these are thoughts of an unr=
ealized person and the worth can be next to nothing). When we take example =
cases of Swami Vivekananda or Vimalananda or Sainbaba or any other such ack=
nowledged spiritual giants, we tend to forget that they are all realized so=
uls who achieved very high level of spiritual realization. They are knower =
of everything or many things in the universe. Their individual ego is perfe=
ctly and completely tuned to universal ego. In short they *know* what they =
are doing. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis'. Relevant to our topic of discussion=
, I would say that if they ate meat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco or kille=
d animals, they actually knew what they are doing. There would be surely a =
specific purpose behind each and every action of theirs because as I said, =
they know complete background behind their each action and
 moreover their =
self identification is missing from the action and hence it is like Nature =
operates through them to accomplish a special purpose without binding them =
in any cause-effect chain.
Ramakrishna used to frequently say to all his di=
sciples that Naren is very different from others. He has a blazing spiritua=
l fire burning within him which can consume anything and everything. A food=
 restriction does not bind him. He can eat anything without getting spiritu=
ally troubled but for others, a kind of food intake is extremely important.=

If Vivekananda ate meat during his stay in west, it'll surely have some su=
btle purpose which is not possible for majority of us to comprehend unless =
explained by a person of that level. He might be removing `guilt' from the =
sincere seekers amongst westerners so that he can be accepted by them as on=
e of them and then slowly try to eradicate their habits of meat eating and =
such other undesirable habits. It is also possible at the same time that he=
 is nullifying some balanced Rinanubandha with the `Animal' whose meat he a=
te. It is also possible that he would have showered his unseen blessings on=
 the animal's soul by consuming its meat. It's possible that there were no =
apparent reasons for that but just a natural inconsequential act. We'll not=
 know. Only Vivekananda, His Guru and Mother Nature know. By the way Viveka=
nanda saved a boy from drowning in a lake in USA while he was still in Indi=
a and did not even planned to go to USA. When the boy, after some
 years ac=
tually met Swami in USA for the first time, swami immediately told him to s=
tay away from water and when he requested swami to accept him as his discip=
le, swami, after a moments thought told him that he is not his guru and his=
 guru will come later and will give him Silver Cup as a gift. That man late=
r became disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda and after 40 years, he was actual=
ly given a gift of Silver-cup by Yogananda which literally fulfilled what s=
wami Vivekananda `knew' before 40 years.

Swami Vivekananda was all knowing=
 and most of us are NOT.

So moral of my whole writings is that it's unwise=
 as well as self deluding to take excuses of the unconventional habits of S=
wami Vivekananda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vimalananda, Gajanana Maharaj, Swami Sam=
arth, Trailang Swami and such masters and justify our completely self ident=
ified and utterly selfish cruel/unjust actions.

Best Regards,

Utpal

Opinion of Great Vimalananda on 'Meat eaters' and repercussions from=C3=82&=
nbsp;'Aghora, from the left hand of God'<BR>> Choice is ours !<BR>> "=
Ma wants you to learn your lesson. That is why you find a meat-eater reborn=
 either as a predator or prey or as both in succession. Human beings cry a =
lot at funerals of their own kind but they have absolutely no thought for t=
he sufferings of the animals they slaughter. They never hesitate to kill an=
d eat. Just think, first they kill the chicken. Often they will cut its thr=
oat and let it bleed to death, which
 is a most painful way to die. Then it=
 will be cleaned, cooked and eaten, and if it happens to be tough everyone =
will curse it for not satisfying their palates. How many humans would give =
beautiful tender lean meat if they were slaughtered, dressed, prepared and =
served?<BR>> Meat-eaters conveniently forget that animal mothers too lov=
e their children. Do they ever think of the agony a hen goes through when h=
er chicks are slain in front of her eyes? or a cow, the embodiment of mothe=
rliness, do they consider how much she suffers when she sees the slaughter =
of her beloved calf whom she has grown in her own body and nourished with h=
er milk, whom she loves more than her own life?<BR>> Do these so called =
humans ever think of the terrible pain they cause to mother cow? Could they=
 endure their own children being murdered before their own eyes?<BR>> Ho=
w is Ma to teach such donkeys? They are not humans, whose intellect is subt=
le enough to self-identify
 with another being of a different species and e=
xperience its personal joys and sorrows. Ma has no alternative but to make =
them suffer, allowing the animals they have tortured to torture them in ret=
urn. Fair's fair, after all. If I cut your throat in this birth you have ev=
ery right to cut mine in the next or some succeeding birth. Experience is t=
he best teacher and a fool will learn from no other."=C3=82  <BR>> =
