Dear Narasimha Ji,friends,

I got confused. 

>   Say "Om Bhur bhuvah suvah=
" once in the beginning. Then start repeating the following:
>   Om tatsavi=
tur .... varenyam Om

Does it mean:
1. Say "Om Bhur bhuvah suvah" once in t=
he begining and then only recite "Om tatsatvitur varenyam bhargo devaysa dh=
imahi dhiyo yonah prachodayat Om" for n number of times??

Regards,
Amit Ku=
mar

     The universe has many lokas (planes of consciousness), many beings and=
 many objects. There are infinite karmic interactions possible between them=
. Accordingly, there are infinite possible mantras. When one is able to per=
fectly control the mind and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but t=
he mantra reverberating in the mind constantly), then one experiences the m=
antra. This perfect absorption of self-awareness in the mantra then causes =
internal changes by the flow of energy internally in specific ways (specifi=
c to the mantra) and that causes corresponding external changes in the univ=
erse and corresponding karmic interactions between various objects.
> 
>   =
            However, this variety of mantras, experiences and results is ir=
relevant to one who does not have such perfect control over the mind to abs=
orb the mind fully in a mantra. It is relevant only to a seer whose self-aw=
areness is quite evolved and hence control over mind impeccable. Such seers=
 are extremely extremely rare today. Most people are unable to experience a=
ny mantra and mantras do not work for them as they are supposed to.

            One more thing. We have many mantras given by rishis, but the g=
uidelines from rishis like Parasara on how to pick a mantra based on the ho=
roscope are very limited. Astrologers today do not operate solely based on =
them. They use all kinds of other rules coming from various traditions. The=
y are not free from corruption and imperfection. Most scriptures associate =
various mantras with various results, irrespective of horoscope. For exampl=
e, irrespective of who is the 6th lord and 8th lord and lord of A6 and A8, =
Rina Vimochaka Angaraka mantra is good for debt control. And so on. Linking=
 of horoscope is overplayed by today's astrologers, way beyond the scope of=
 Parasara's guidelines.

If one eats food, a good amount of internal fire (and subtle internal energ=
y associated with it) is used for digesting it and for generating physical =
energy from it. If one fasts, that subtle energy is unused and available fo=
r other things. This is a tremendous benefit. As a result, one can better d=
igest mantras and spiritual food available all around one.
