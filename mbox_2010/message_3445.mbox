Dear Rajarshi,
=C2=A0
Thanks for the beautiful acc=
ount. You are lucky to have spent time with Manish in the blessed city of K=
ashi and that too at the blessed Manikarnika ghat.
=C2=A0
There is somethin=
g about Manish and dogs. Even when we two were doing a Chandi homam atop a =
hill in Kurukshetra in May 2008, a similar thing happened. A pack of 7-8 do=
gs living on that hill came and sat around the homam to watch. They were ca=
lm for the entire homam (a couple of hours) and watched it. When bali (we u=
sed raisins, i.e. kismis) was offered at the end, they all got up together =
and ran in one direction barking and jumping up. It was as though they were=
 trying to chase someone.
=C2=A0
Some say that several animals, especially =
dogs, have subtle extra-sensory perception that is superior to that of huma=
ns.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
That homam is still fresh in my mind. Whe=
n we were climbing that hill in the afternoon to do some shooting, Manish t=
old me, "we have a strong connection with this place. Something will happen=
 here today." When we discovered two Nath path sadhus following Gorakhnath =
(Gorakshanath) living there, we talked to them for a while. Manish saw thei=
r homa kundam there and asked, "we do a Chandi homam everyday. Can we do it=
 in your homa kundam tonight?" The person said, "we are worshippers of Nara=
yana and do not want any taamasik deities to be called or any taamasik prac=
tices resorted to." We told him we would call Mahalakshmi in fire and there=
 would be no taamasik practices. Then he consented.
=C2=A0
We left and reac=
hed the hill with materials around 8:30 pm. The hill and its surroundings w=
ere pitch dark and silent. There was no electricity in that area. We climbe=
d the hill using Manish's cell phone backlight to show the way. There were =
several dogs there and they started barking when they saw us climbing. But =
when we started the homam, dogs stopped barking and sat around the fire cal=
mly. An old sadhu also came out of the hut and sat near the fire.
=C2=A0
Th=
e moment The Mother was invoked in fire, the whole place that was silent ti=
ll then except for our chants suddenly came alive with all kinds of sounds.=
 There was a valley in the eastern direction. A lot of birds suddenly rose =
up from their trees in that area and started making loud sounds. The whole =
area resounded with the sounds of birds, beetles etc. Given the silence til=
l then, this huge commotion felt quite eerie.
=C2=A0

=C2=A0
=
While on the topic of that trip, I can mention something personal that demo=
nstrates how pride keeps coming back, as taught by Ramakrishna in the story=
 sent by Prasanth today.
=C2=A0
During that trip in the Indian summer of 20=
08, Manish kept on feeding my ego. He praised me to the skies in front of s=
everal people. When a lady saint in the lineage of Upasani Maharaj was talk=
ing about Upasani Maharaj, Manish would bring me into the topic and mention=
 great things about me. As he kept praising me in front of people, I was fi=
rst unaffected. But it slowly got to my head. I started to feel special.
=
=C2=A0
On the night of that homam atop a hill in Kurukshetra, Manish relaxe=
d his rule of not allowing another person to put aahutis in fire when doing=
 homam. Though the plan was that I would do homam in my homa kundam and Man=
ish would do in their homa kundam, he changed his mind at the last minute a=
nd said we would do together in the same homa kundam. He said I was ready a=
nd could share homam with him. I was ecstatic and saw it as an "acknowledgm=
ent" of my "spiritual progress". My already provoked pride peaked with this=
.
=C2=A0
My mind was filled with proud thoughts and my focus on mantra and =
deity was weak, as we chanted Saptashati during that night's homam. Manish =
said nothing there. The moment homam was over and we went back, he scolded =
me with a very stern and serious tone, "what were you thinking? We called t=
he Mother in fire and you were so distracted. You wasted a great opportunit=
y tonight. We are chootiyas (an expletive) and She is the Mother of the uni=
verse. How can you absorb your mind in egoistic thoughts in her presence? H=
ad I been strict like my gurus or like the gurus of the old times, you woul=
d've been killed today." He was in that serious mood for an hour or so and =
then became very kind and compassionate again. He laughed, "are you still t=
hinking about it? Leave it Narasimha. These things happen. Everything happe=
ns for good. I have no doubt you will overcome. Time has to come for anythi=
ng. Don't worry and keep doing sadhana."
=C2=A0
I realized that day that Ma=
haamaayaa is very powerful. Irrespective of what you experience and irrespe=
ctive of how much progress you make, she can delude you in a split second. =
In fact, the experiences one has and the progress one makes is not really o=
ne's. She gives them and she uses them to bind one. The moment one thinks "=
I, so-and-so individual, exist" and attributes those "experiences" and "pro=
gress" to that "I", one is instantly bound - there is scope for pride, happ=
iness, unhappiness etc and one can be deluded. Constant surrender to the su=
preme power running the universe, while performing the duties that one is i=
nspired to perform using the body inhabited by one and without paying ANY a=
ttention to ANY results that come, including praises and criticism, is the =
only solution.
=C2=A0
This experience taught me a very valuable lesson. Wha=
t Manish said about me to others in my presence may have been a way of test=
ing me. It is also possible that it is correct. In either case, it does not=
 matter. The persona (body-name-entity) one inhabits on earth is a *tempora=
ry* abode allocated to one for fulfilling one's dharma. Attributes of that =
persona, including its merits and demerits, are irrelevant to one. The mome=
nt one looks at that persona as "I" and forms an attachment to the attribut=
es of that persona, one gets bound. Instead, one should just use that perso=
na to fulfill dharma without forming an attachment. An attachment to a pers=
ona brings many happinesses and many miseries and binds one, irrespective o=
f how meritorious that persona is. At the end of the day, everything that i=
s temporary perishes.
=C2=A0
Also, note that pride can strike anytime anywh=
ere, as long as one has an attachment to the persona. Keep doing sadhana, w=
hile constantly contemplating and guarding against such an attachment. Prid=
e is suppressed for a while, comes back again, is suppressed again, comes b=
ack again and so on. This cycle goes on until one's attachment to the perso=
na is killed completely. This is a long process. Don't worry too much and j=
ust keep doing sadhana.

=C2=A0
The thing about the hu=
ngry kid reminds me of something. When Manish and I were climbing down at G=
irnar around sunset, a lame dog that was walking on 3 legs started followin=
g us. It came with us a long way. At one point, it ran ahead of us and sat =
in front of a roadside (or rather stair-side) stall that was still open. Ma=
nish stopped there, bought some biscuit packets and fed some to the dog. Th=
at dog stopped following us then. In a couple of minutes, we encountered an=
 old man in shoddy clothes. He was weeping. Manish stopped and asked him wh=
at happened. He said he lost all his money at a hotel in Junagadh and has n=
o money to even buy food. He decided to just climb the hill (it has 7,000 s=
tairs!) and go to Dattatreya and leave it to him to help him out. He was cl=
imbing up, while we were climbing down. It was getting nearly dark then. Ma=
nish gave him a lot of money, all the biscuit packets that were with us and=
 a soft drink. He thanked and gave back a few
 biscuit pieces to me and sai=
d, "you guys keep this."
=C2=A0
Later Manish told me the same thing he told=
 you, "you never know when and in what form god comes to test you. Kindness=
 and compassion towards needy people is an important dharma."
=C2=A0
One do=
es not need to do something beyond one's means. But, one can have compassio=
n, feel the other person's pain and help within one's means.
=C2=A0
I consi=
dered the biscuit pieces given back by that old man as Dattatreya's prasad =
and ate it. Regarding the child you saw, please note that Vatuka Bhairava i=
s depicted as a child.

=C2=A0
BTW, the Girnar trip ha=
ppenened unplanned. We were supposed to be in Dwaraka for one more day shoo=
ting for the Krishna movie. But we basically finished what we had intended.=
 So I was thinking in my mind with dissatisfaction, "why does Manish want t=
o prolong things here and shoot more? We are done here. Why can't we just l=
eave Dwaraka and perhaps go to Girnar for a day?" I kept my thoughts to mys=
elf. It was late in the evening and we were on our way to a Shiva temple at=
 Dwaraka. All of a sudden, Manish told the driver to stop and turn back to =
the hotel. He announced that we were leaving for Girnar. He said, "bulawa a=
a gaya. hum Girnar jaayenge" (invitation has arrived. We will go to Girnar.=
) We rushed to the hotel, packed and left in 10 minutes. We reached Girnar =
around midnight and spent the next day there. For those who do not know, Gi=
rnar is considered the abode of Lord Dattatreya.
=C2=A0
Sometimes, Manish h=
as the uncanny ability to respond to one's thoughts. However, he says it is=
 not his ability, but it is Nature listening to one's wish and fulfilling t=
hrough another.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Imagine chess pieces being mo=
ved by an expert player thinking "I am an powerful king. I am great", "I am=
 a beautiful queen. I am great", "I am a strong knight. I am great", "I kil=
led a great bishop despite being a pawn. I am great", "I am just a pawn, bu=
t I sacrificed myself to trap the queen. I am great" etc.
=C2=A0
It may sou=
nd weird, but this is what happens in real life all the time. You, I, all t=
hese people are pieces in another kind of chess game. Not realizing that a =
player is moving us, we engage in egoistic thoughts, fake happiness, fake s=
adness, fake pride, fake shame etc. One is free from all those fake feeling=
s if one realizes this. Of course, that does not mean inaction. The inspira=
tion that comes in us to engage in various actions in the world is like the=
 hand of the player moving the piece. We should respect that engage in acti=
ons, but not see them as our actions.

=C2=A0 






Dear Narasimha and others,
=C2=A0
Rajarshi, I hope=
 you had a nice stay at Varanasi with Manish. I see that your signature cha=
nged after the trip.
=C2=A0
We had a remarkable time at Varanasi. 
=C2=A0
T=
he moment our flight landed at the Kashi airport which is actually quite ou=
tside the main city of Kashi, Manish said there is something in here which =
is different. The energy is palpable throughout. After checking in at the h=
otel we spend the time in roaming around the ghats, watching the evening Ga=
nga Arati and shooting.
=C2=A0
By 9 PM Manish decided on doing a Chandi hom=
a, at the famous Manikarnika samshan, on a funeral pyre. Sadhana in a samsh=
an bhoomi is something that many great sadhakas in Hinduism have done befor=
e. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa used to perform various sadhanas in a samshan.Sr=
i Trilanga Swami - a great siddha -=C2=A0spent most of his days near the Ma=
nikarnik Samshan doing sadhana.=C2=A0The effect that a Samshan has on the h=
uman consciousness can be apty used, for those who have such inclination, t=
o further ones spiritual growth. The fire of a funeral pyre is called kravy=
ada agni, an impure form of fire unlike the fire of a standard homa agni. H=
owever, there have been sadhakas, and many in number, who has used the sams=
han agni to perform homas. They chose not to make a distinction between pur=
e and impure.If someone feels that a funeral pyre is "unholy", he or she wo=
uld be better off not trying anything in such a fire. The main deities of a=
 samshan bhoomi are Mahakala and
 Mahakali. 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0We went to buy so=
me samagri - til (black and white), couple of=C2=A0full coconuts, flowers, =
incense stick (agabatti), =C2=A0kismis, havan samagri. While buying the sam=
agri from a shop inside a lane near the Vishwanath temple, suddenly a small=
 begger child came and kept asking for food. There was a sweet shop on the =
other side of the lane, he pointed to the shop asking for food. Manish turn=
ed around, bought some food and gave it to the child. The child was eating =
when we turned back towards the shop from where we were buying the samagri.=
 In a moment Manish asked me to check for the child, I turned round and fou=
nd no one there. I looked in the lane and there was no child anywhere. Just=
 gone, vanished! I still remember the child very clearly. Manish smiled and=
 said, " The deity of this place wanted to see whether we=C2=A0had become s=
o big sadhakas that we=C2=A0are unable to feed a hungry child=C2=A0. That i=
s how God comes to test people.=C2=A0Kya pata Narayan kab, kaha aur=C2=A0ki=
s
 roop me mil jaye."
=C2=A0
At 11 pm we left for Manikarnik, dressed in a =
combination of red and black. Walking along the ghats we reached the samsha=
n at around eleven thirty. It was quite crowded, with=C2=A0domes (people wh=
o work there to help the bodies burn) and the relatives. There were at leas=
t 8 to 10 pyres burning simultaneously. Right next to it was the Ganges, pi=
tch black at night. We sat on a stairs, waiting for the crowd to ease out a=
 bit, not sure when that will happen, not sure=C2=A0how people are going to=
 react. As we sat observing, the people too were observing us with a mix of=
 curiosity=C2=A0and possible=C2=A0apprehension.=C2=A0Suddenly Manish closed=
 his eyes and meditated some time, then remarked that this place has a trem=
endous energy. Something of almost infinite abilities resides in this samsh=
an bhoomi. A deity. While sayingf so he turned behind to look at something,=
 I too turned. I could see nothing but blank space. But that very instant t=
he dogs in the samshan went running=C2=A0to
 that direction.
=C2=A0
After w=
aiting like this for about an hour, we found a pyre where the relatives had=
 left.The major portion had been burnt already, but there was enough left t=
o last for some time still. We went and sat next to it. Manish started the =
homa. The offering was of til. I sat next to him doing the Chandi path, try=
ing to be in sync with his recital. A part of my mind was also trying to ad=
just itself to the ambience. There were quite a few people around watching =
what we were upto. But no one disturbed. The dome had to come and take wood=
 from the pyre to light other pyres. He did it in the most cautious manner =
possible, taking pieces from the fringe of the pyre. After some time Manish=
 indicated to him not to take any more wood. The dome nodded his head and d=
id not disturb that pyre again. 
=C2=A0
Very soon, within half an hour I no=
ticed that a pack of 4/5 dogs had come and were sitting around the pyre on =
which the homa was being done. As=C2=A0I=C2=A0read the Chandi I felt a grea=
t pressure on my head, from all sides. As if a something was pressing hard =
on my skull, gripping it tight. The concentration become excellent. I soon =
forgot who was watching us or anything else around me, except for the sound=
 of the Chandi Path. Very nice meditation happened. The mind felt like as i=
f it was a piece of iron and there=C2=A0was a huuuuge magnet nearby which j=
ust kept pulling the mind away to some distant place, far, far away from th=
e reality I am normally=C2=A0accustomed to.=C2=A0While the homa was on, sud=
denly=C2=A0one black dog from the pack which was sitting nearby, sat up on =
two legs and kept starting at Manish. For I think about 10 mins it kept sta=
ring with it's head pointed in an angular fashion. Its eyes and mannerism g=
ave a feeling as if it is not an animal but a human being
 watching. Just s=
taring and observing every action. Manish said Kala Bhairava had entered in=
to the body of that dog.
=C2=A0
The homa finished at around 3 AM. The medit=
ations both at the end as well as in between, were all excellent. The mind =
would just get pulled a few notches above the ordinary with slightest bit o=
f effort.
=C2=A0
Simply being in a samshan and observing the human body bur=
ning up has a powerful effect on the mind. In a nearby pyre we saw the femu=
r bones of a female human body burning. Both the femurs were visible and sp=
read apart. In an ordinary setting, this kind of a scene would mean a woman=
 with "legs spread apart" which has a very sexual connotation. In Manikarni=
k, on that night, it only evoked a feeling of how eventually the body is me=
rely a covering for something far more real and powerful that resides insid=
e. The skin, flesh, bones etc will perish as they are ment to perish. Only =
Rama naam satya hai.
=C2=A0
Manish said if your intentions of going to a sa=
mshan bhoomi is merely to please God through sadhanas=C2=A0- i.e you are no=
t planning something negative nor desirous of petty mundane gains - there i=
s very little chance that you will ever come to harm. Further, when you do =
a Chandi homa, no ethereal beings will disturb you because no one wants to =
mess with=C2=A0someone who is worshipping Chandi. It is not difficult, neit=
her something to be unnecessarily scared of. There are spirits etc for sure=
, but neither will you bother them nor will they bother you. =C2=A0Surrende=
ring to the deity is very good=C2=A0attitude to have. And finally, the soul=
 of the individual on whose pyre the homa is being done, is taken by the Go=
ddess and acquires a lot of punya.
=C2=A0
Thus ended my first experience of=
 a Chandi homa on a burning pyre.That night was Krishna Saptami. The next t=
wo nights again we did homas at Manikarnik.

nbsp;<BR>There is something about Manish and dogs. Even when we two were do=
ing a Chandi homam atop a hill in Kurukshetra in May 2008, a similar thing =
happened. A pack of 7-8 dogs living on that hill came and sat around the ho=
mam to watch. They were calm for the entire homam (a couple of hours) and w=
atched it. When bali (we used raisins, i.e. kismis) was offered at the end,=
 they all got up together and ran in one direction barking and jumping up. =
It was as though they were trying to chase someone.<BR> <BR>Some say t=
hat several animals, especially dogs, have subtle extra-sensory perception =
that is superior to that of humans.<BR> <BR>*    &=
nbsp;   *        *<BR> <B=
R>That homam is
 still fresh in my mind. When we were climbing that hill in=
 the afternoon to do some shooting, Manish told me, "we have a strong conne=
ction with this place. Something will happen here today." When we discovere=
d two Nath path sadhus following Gorakhnath (Gorakshanath) living there, we=
 talked to them for a while. Manish saw their homa kundam there and asked, =
"we do a Chandi homam everyday. Can we do it in your homa kundam tonight?" =
The person said, "we are worshippers of Narayana and do not want any taamas=
ik deities to be called or any taamasik practices resorted to." We told him=
 we would call Mahalakshmi in fire and there would be no taamasik practices=
. Then he consented.<BR> <BR>We left and reached the hill with materia=
ls around 8:30 pm. The hill and its surroundings were pitch dark and silent=
. There was no electricity in that area. We climbed the hill using Manish's=
 cell phone backlight to show the way. There were several dogs there and th=
ey
 started barking when they saw us climbing. But when we started the homa=
m, dogs stopped barking and sat around the fire calmly. An old sadhu also c=
ame out of the hut and sat near the fire.<BR> <BR>The moment The Mothe=
r was invoked in fire, the whole place that was silent till then except for=
 our chants suddenly came alive with all kinds of sounds. There was a valle=
y in the eastern direction. A lot of birds suddenly rose up from their tree=
s in that area and started making loud sounds. The whole area resounded wit=
h the sounds of birds, beetles etc. Given the silence till then, this huge =
commotion felt quite eerie.<BR> <BR>*     &nb=
sp;  *        *<BR> <BR>While =
on the topic of that trip, I can mention something personal that demonstrat=
es how pride keeps coming back, as taught by Ramakrishna in the story sent =
by Prasanth today.<BR> <BR>During that trip in the Indian summer
 of 2=
008, Manish kept on feeding my ego. He praised me to the skies in front of =
several people. When a lady saint in the lineage of Upasani Maharaj was tal=
king about Upasani Maharaj, Manish would bring me into the topic and mentio=
n great things about me. As he kept praising me in front of people, I was f=
irst unaffected. But it slowly got to my head. I started to feel special.<B=
R> <BR>On the night of that homam atop a hill in Kurukshetra, Manish r=
elaxed his rule of not allowing another person to put aahutis in fire when =
doing homam. Though the plan was that I would do homam in my homa kundam an=
d Manish would do in their homa kundam, he changed his mind at the last min=
ute and said we would do together in the same homa kundam. He said I was re=
ady and could share homam with him. I was ecstatic and saw it as an "acknow=
ledgment" of my "spiritual progress". My already provoked pride peaked with=
 this.<BR> <BR>My mind was filled with proud thoughts and
 my focus on=
 mantra and deity was weak, as we chanted Saptashati during that night's ho=
mam. Manish said nothing there. The moment homam was over and we went back,=
 he scolded me with a very stern and serious tone, "what were you thinking?=
 We called the Mother in fire and you were so distracted. You wasted a grea=
t opportunity tonight. We are chootiyas (an expletive) and She is the Mothe=
r of the universe. How can you absorb your mind in egoistic thoughts in her=
 presence? Had I been strict like my gurus or like the gurus of the old tim=
es, you would've been killed today." He was in that serious mood for an hou=
r or so and then became very kind and compassionate again. He laughed, "are=
 you still thinking about it? Leave it Narasimha. These things happen. Ever=
ything happens for good. I have no doubt you will overcome. Time has to com=
e for anything. Don't worry and keep doing sadhana."<BR> <BR>I realize=
d that day that Mahaamaayaa is very powerful.
 Irrespective of what you exp=
erience and irrespective of how much progress you make, she can delude you =
in a split second. In fact, the experiences one has and the progress one ma=
kes is not really one's. She gives them and she uses them to bind one. The =
moment one thinks "I, so-and-so individual, exist" and attributes those "ex=
periences" and "progress" to that "I", one is instantly bound - there is sc=
ope for pride, happiness, unhappiness etc and one can be deluded. Constant =
surrender to the supreme power running the universe, while performing the d=
uties that one is inspired to perform using the body inhabited by one and w=
ithout paying ANY attention to ANY results that come, including praises and=
 criticism, is the only solution.<BR> <BR>This experience taught me a =
very valuable lesson. What Manish said about me to others in my presence ma=
y have been a way of testing me. It is also possible that it is correct. In=
 either case, it does not matter. The
 persona (body-name-entity) one inhab=
its on earth is a *temporary* abode allocated to one for fulfilling one's d=
harma. Attributes of that persona, including its merits and demerits, are i=
rrelevant to one. The moment one looks at that persona as "I" and forms an =
attachment to the attributes of that persona, one gets bound. Instead, one =
should just use that persona to fulfill dharma without forming an attachmen=
t. An attachment to a persona brings many happinesses and many miseries and=
 binds one, irrespective of how meritorious that persona is. At the end of =
the day, everything that is temporary perishes.<BR> <BR>Also, note tha=
t pride can strike anytime anywhere, as long as one has an attachment to th=
e persona. Keep doing sadhana, while constantly contemplating and guarding =
against such an attachment. Pride is suppressed for a while, comes back aga=
in, is suppressed again, comes back again and so on. This cycle goes on unt=
il one's attachment to the
 persona is killed completely. This is a long pr=
ocess. Don't worry too much and just keep doing sadhana.<BR> <BR>*&nbs=
p;       *      =
;  *<BR> <BR>The thing about the hungry kid reminds me of somethi=
ng. When Manish and I were climbing down at Girnar around sunset, a lame do=
g that was walking on 3 legs started following us. It came with us a long w=
ay. At one point, it ran ahead of us and sat in front of a roadside (or rat=
her stair-side) stall that was still open. Manish stopped there, bought som=
e biscuit packets and fed some to the dog. That dog stopped following us th=
en. In a couple of minutes, we encountered an old man in shoddy clothes. He=
 was weeping. Manish stopped and asked him what happened. He said he lost a=
ll his money at a hotel in Junagadh and has no money to even buy food. He d=
ecided to just climb the hill (it has 7,000 stairs!) and go to Dattatreya a=
nd leave it to him
 to help him out. He was climbing up, while we were clim=
bing down. It was getting nearly dark then. Manish gave him a lot of money,=
 all the biscuit packets that were with us and a soft drink. He thanked and=
 gave back a few biscuit pieces to me and said, "you guys keep this."<BR>&n=
bsp;<BR>Later Manish told me the same thing he told you, "you never know wh=
en and in what form god comes to test you. Kindness and compassion towards =
needy people is an important dharma."<BR> <BR>One does not need to do =
something beyond one's means. But, one can have compassion, feel the other =
person's pain and help within one's means.<BR> <BR>I considered the bi=
scuit pieces given back by that old man as Dattatreya's prasad and ate it. =
Regarding the child you saw, please note that Vatuka Bhairava is depicted a=
s a child.<BR> <BR>*        * =
       *<BR> <BR>BTW, the Girnar trip ha=
ppenened
 unplanned. We were supposed to be in Dwaraka for one more day sho=
oting for the Krishna movie. But we basically finished what we had intended=
. So I was thinking in my mind with dissatisfaction, "why does Manish want =
to prolong things here and shoot more? We are done here. Why can't we just =
leave Dwaraka and perhaps go to Girnar for a day?" I kept my thoughts to my=
self. It was late in the evening and we were on our way to a Shiva temple a=
t Dwaraka. All of a sudden, Manish told the driver to stop and turn back to=
 the hotel. He announced that we were leaving for Girnar. He said, "bulawa =
aa gaya. hum Girnar jaayenge" (invitation has arrived. We will go to Girnar=
.) We rushed to the hotel, packed and left in 10 minutes. We reached Girnar=
 around midnight and spent the next day there. For those who do not know, G=
irnar is considered the abode of Lord Dattatreya.<BR> <BR>Sometimes, M=
anish has the uncanny ability to respond to one's thoughts. However, he say=
s
 it is not his ability, but it is Nature listening to one's wish and fulf=
illing through another.<BR> <BR>*      &=
nbsp; *        *<BR> <BR>Imagine ch=
ess pieces being moved by an expert player thinking "I am an powerful king.=
 I am great", "I am a beautiful queen. I am great", "I am a strong knight. =
I am great", "I killed a great bishop despite being a pawn. I am great", "I=
 am just a pawn, but I sacrificed myself to trap the queen. I am great" etc=
.<BR> <BR>It may sound weird, but this is what happens in real life al=
l the time. You, I, all these people are pieces in another kind of chess ga=
me. Not realizing that a player is moving us, we engage in egoistic thought=
s, fake happiness, fake sadness, fake pride, fake shame etc. One is free fr=
om all those fake feelings if one realizes this. Of course, that does not m=
ean inaction. The inspiration that comes in us to engage in various
 action=
s in the world is like the hand of the player moving the piece. We should r=

<DIV>Dear Narasimha and others,</DI=
V>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV><EM>Rajarshi, I hope you had a nice stay at Varan=
asi with Manish. I see that your signature changed after the trip.</EM></DI=
V>
<DIV><EM></EM> </DIV>
<DIV>We had a remarkable time at Varanasi. </=
DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>The moment our flight landed at the Kashi airpo=
rt which is actually quite outside the main city of Kashi, Manish said ther=
e is something in here which is different. The energy is palpable throughou=
t. After checking in at the hotel we spend the time in roaming around the g=
hats, watching the evening Ganga Arati and shooting.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV=
>
<DIV>By 9 PM Manish decided on doing a Chandi homa, at the famous Manikar=
nika samshan, on a funeral pyre. Sadhana in a samshan bhoomi is something t=
hat many great sadhakas in Hinduism have done before. Ramakrishna Paramaham=
sa used to perform various sadhanas in a samshan.Sri Trilanga Swami - a gre=
at siddha - spent most of his days near the Manikarnik Samshan doing s=
adhana. The effect that a Samshan has on the human consciousness can b=
e apty used, for those who have such inclination, to further ones spiritual=
 growth. The fire of a funeral pyre is called kravyada agni, an impure form=
 of fire unlike the fire of a standard homa agni. However, there have been =
sadhakas, and many in number, who has used the samshan agni to perform homa=
s. They chose not to make a distinction between pure and impure.If someone =
feels that a funeral pyre is "unholy", he or she would be better off not tr=
ying anything in such a fire. The main deities of a samshan bhoomi are
 Mah=
akala and Mahakali. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV> We went to buy some=
 samagri - til (black and white), couple of full coconuts, flowers, in=
cense stick (agabatti),  kismis, havan samagri. While buying the samag=
ri from a shop inside a lane near the Vishwanath temple, suddenly a small b=
egger child came and kept asking for food. There was a sweet shop on the ot=
her side of the lane, he pointed to the shop asking for food. Manish turned=
 around, bought some food and gave it to the child. The child was eating wh=
en we turned back towards the shop from where we were buying the samagri. I=
n a moment Manish asked me to check for the child, I turned round and found=
 no one there. I looked in the lane and there was no child anywhere. Just g=
one, vanished! I still remember the child very clearly. Manish smiled and s=
aid, " The deity of this place wanted to see whether we had become so =
big sadhakas that we are unable to feed a hungry child . That is =
how God comes to test people. Kya
 pata Narayan kab, kaha aur kis=
 roop me mil jaye."</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>At 11 pm we left for Manik=
arnik, dressed in a combination of red and black. Walking along the ghats w=
e reached the samshan at around eleven thirty. It was quite crowded, with&n=
bsp;domes (people who work there to help the bodies burn) and the relatives=
. There were at least 8 to 10 pyres burning simultaneously. Right next to i=
t was the Ganges, pitch black at night. We sat on a stairs, waiting for the=
 crowd to ease out a bit, not sure when that will happen, not sure how=
 people are going to react. As we sat observing, the people too were observ=
ing us with a mix of curiosity and possible apprehension. Su=
ddenly Manish closed his eyes and meditated some time, then remarked that t=
his place has a tremendous energy. Something of almost infinite abilities r=
esides in this samshan bhoomi. A deity. While sayingf so he turned behind t=
o look at something, I too turned. I could see nothing but blank space. But=
 that very instant the dogs in the
 samshan went running to that direc=
tion.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>After waiting like this for about an hou=
r, we found a pyre where the relatives had left.The major portion had been =
burnt already, but there was enough left to last for some time still. We we=
nt and sat next to it. Manish started the homa. The offering was of til. I =
sat next to him doing the Chandi path, trying to be in sync with his recita=
l. A part of my mind was also trying to adjust itself to the ambience. Ther=
e were quite a few people around watching what we were upto. But no one dis=
turbed. The dome had to come and take wood from the pyre to light other pyr=
es. He did it in the most cautious manner possible, taking pieces from the =
fringe of the pyre. After some time Manish indicated to him not to take any=
 more wood. The dome nodded his head and did not disturb that pyre again. <=
/DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Very soon, within half an hour I noticed that =
a pack of 4/5 dogs had come and were sitting around the pyre on which the h=
oma was being done. As I read the Chandi I felt a great pressure =
on my head, from all sides. As if a something was pressing hard on my skull=
, gripping it tight. The concentration become excellent. I soon forgot who =
was watching us or anything else around me, except for the sound of the Cha=
ndi Path. Very nice meditation happened. The mind felt like as if it was a =
piece of iron and there was a huuuuge magnet nearby which just kept pu=
lling the mind away to some distant place, far, far away from the reality I=
 am normally accustomed to. While the homa was on, suddenly =
one black dog from the pack which was sitting nearby, sat up on two legs an=
d kept starting at Manish. For I think about 10 mins it kept staring with i=
t's head pointed in an angular fashion. Its eyes and mannerism gave a feeli=
ng as if it is
 not an animal but a human being watching. Just staring and =
observing every action. Manish said Kala Bhairava had entered into the body=
 of that dog.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>The homa finished at around 3 AM=
. The meditations both at the end as well as in between, were all excellent=
. The mind would just get pulled a few notches above the ordinary with slig=
htest bit of effort.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Simply being in a samshan=
 and observing the human body burning up has a powerful effect on the mind.=
 In a nearby pyre we saw the femur bones of a female human body burning. Bo=
th the femurs were visible and spread apart. In an ordinary setting, this k=
ind of a scene would mean a woman with "legs spread apart" which has a very=
 sexual connotation. In Manikarnik, on that night, it only evoked a feeling=
 of how eventually the body is merely a covering for something far more rea=
l and powerful that resides inside. The skin, flesh, bones etc will perish =
as they are ment to perish. Only Rama naam satya hai.</DIV>
<DIV> </DI=
V>
<DIV>Manish said if your intentions of going to a samshan bhoomi is mere=
ly to please God through sadhanas - i.e you are not planning something=
 negative nor desirous of petty mundane gains - there is very little chance=
 that you will ever come to harm. Further, when you do a Chandi homa, no et=
hereal beings will disturb you because no one wants to mess with someo=
ne who is worshipping Chandi. It is not difficult, neither something to be =
unnecessarily scared of. There are spirits etc for sure, but neither will y=
ou bother them nor will they bother you.  Surrendering to the deity is=
 very good attitude to have. And finally, the soul of the individual o=
n whose pyre the homa is being done, is taken by the Goddess and acquires a=
 lot of punya.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Thus ended my first experience =
of a Chandi homa on a burning pyre.That night was Krishna Saptami. The next=
 two nights again we did homas at Manikarnik. </DIV>
