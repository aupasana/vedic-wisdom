 To say that one is apart
from the Primal Source
is itself a pretension;
to=
 add that one divested of the ego
becomes pure and yet retains individualit=
y
only to enjoy or serve the Supreme,
is a deceitful stratagem.
What duplic=
ity is this --
first to appropriate what is really His,
and then pretend to=
 experience or serve Him!
Is not all this already known to Him?

It is enou=
gh that one surrenders oneself.
Surrender is to give oneself up
to the orig=
inal cause of one's being.
Do not delude yourself
by imagining such a sourc=
e
to be some God outside you.
One's source is within oneself.
Give yourself=
 up to it.
That means that you should
seek the source and merge in it.

The=
 Swami continued, =E2=80=9CIn actual practice,sadhakas, even sincere ones,
=
sometimes become dejected and lose faith in God. How to restore their faith=
?
What should we do for them?=E2=80=9D

Bhagavan:

If one cannot believe in=
 God, it does not matter. I suppose he believes in
himself, in his own exis=
tence. Let him find out the source from which he
came.

Swami:

Such a man =
will only say the source from which he comes are his parents.

Bhagavan:

H=
e cannot be such an ignoramus, as you started by saying he was a sadhaka in=

this line already"

Deep sleep is only the state of nonduality.
Can the di=
fference between individuals
and Universal souls persist there?
Sleep impli=
es forgetfulness
of all differences.
This alone constitutes happiness.

All=
 efforts are meant only to end ignorance.
They have no use after realizatio=
n.

It is enough that one surrender oneself.
Surrender is to give yourself =
up
to the original cause of one's being.

The gods and sages
experience the=
 Infinite
continuously and eternally,
without their vision being obscured
a=
t any moment.
Their minds are surmised by the spectators
to function, but i=
n fact they do not.
Such surmising is due to the sense of individuality
in =
those who draw inferences.
There is no mental function
in the absence of in=
dividuality.
Individuality and mind functions
are co-existent.
The one cann=
ot remain without the other.

The inherent nature of the Self is Bliss
Some=
 kind of knowledge has to be admitted,
even in the realization of Supreme B=
liss.
it may be said to be subtler than the subtlest.

The pure mind is its=
elf Brahman;
therefore it follows that Brahman
is not other than
the mind o=
f the sage.

We are happy in deep sleep.
We remain then as the pure Self.
W=
e are the same even now.
In such sleep there was neither the wife
nor other=
s nor even "I."
Now they become apparent
and give rise to pleasure or pain.=

Why should not the Self,
which was blissful in deep sleep,
continue its bl=
issful nature even now?
The sole obstruction to such continuity
is the wron=
g identification
of the Self with the body.

"I am Brahman," is only a thou=
ght.
Who says it?
Brahman itself does not say so.
What need is there for it=
 to say it?
Nor can the real "I" say so.
For "I" always abides as Brahman.
=
To be saying it is only a thought.
Whose thought is it?
All thoughts are fr=
om the unreal "I,"
i.e., the "I"-thought.
Remain without thinking.
So long =
as there is thought
there will be fear.

There is no use discussing transce=
ndental experiences
by those whose limitations are not removed.
Learn what =
surrender is.
It is to merge in the source of the ego.
The ego is surrender=
ed to the Self.
Everything is dear to us
because of love of the Self.
The S=
elf is that
to which we surrender our ego
and let the Supreme Power,
I. e.,=
 the Self, do what it pleases.
The ego is already of the Self.
We have no r=
ights over the ego, even as it is.
However, supposing we had,
we must surre=
nder them.
