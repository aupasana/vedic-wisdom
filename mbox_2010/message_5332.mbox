 Rajmohansrinivas ji,

This is wrong. Human body is naturally suited for an omnivorous die=

people do not eat raw meat, normally, people do not eat raw v=

Cooking is a later addition to human society. 


If you=

ample evidence that humans as a speicies, for many milleniums have relied=
 on an 
omnivorous diet:-

a) Human ancestral diets changed substantially a=

b) Humans developed a larger brain =

diet comprisi=
ng of meat, fruits and vegetables. 


c) The gut morphology of the human bo=
dy as it stand todays is ideally 
equidistant from that of carnivores as we=
ll as herbivores. That is because 
humans are designed to be omnivores. The=
 lack of a well developed caecum and

fficult for the body to absorve plant

est you 
to know that the teeth structure of humans is actually identical t=
o, guess what, 
rats who also are omnivores.

clinical nutrition very =
clearly indicates that absorption ability of the human 
body for=C2=A0w.r.t=

lowest for red meat and carrots. Infact the later is considered negative

 it 
than the amount it gains from them. But fish is the easiet to digest. =
You can

whether pava or punya it doesn't m=

Most of the i=

=
=C2=A0Its only illusion to create non-veg will give more strength than veg.=

<DIV>Dear friends,<BR><BR>Namaskar!<BR><BR>Few fri=
ends of mine told me over the week that non vegetarian food increases infer=
tility in men and if the future generation too continue to eat non veg food=
, many men would be sterile in the near future. I have not studied biology =
or chemistry. So from layman's point of view, i have understood from what o=
thers are telling <BR><BR>1) meat especially clogs the arteries and sexual =
reproduction in men is dependent on movement of blood. So not only heart th=
at is affected in non veg eaters but also sexual reproduction system. this =
is surprising since non veg foods are supposed to make men more rajasic and=
 active. <BR><BR>2) for the last 10 years at least the chemicals are being =
used increasingly to make the animals more heavier and tasty after cooking.=
 accordingly even fish, prawns, chickens, goats, buffalo are all being fed =
with food that would make them grow faster and to make their flesh tastier.=
<BR><BR>3) people
 all over the world are ignoring such facts to their own =
peril.<BR><BR>I am a born vegetarian and i do not know the facts about non =
veg foods.<BR><BR>Can someone explain the facts?<BR><BR>Thanks to everyone,=
