Subject: Durga Saptashati Recital during Navratri
X-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=129982417; y=lTxv9KdewJ1bCOrNpgM_I1Rjwjq9RZF_apL-pURZJQ8NyY8X_WAMttK0vA

Namaste,  With Navratri being just around the corner, I'm sure lot of the m=
embers of the group are gearing up toward Saptashati paath.  While Narasimh=
a garu always mentions that merely chanting it without understanding the me=
aning is also excellent, keeping the gist in mind while reciting makes one =
aware of the goal.  

With that in mind, I was about to post a request to N=
arasimha garu to write up a short metaphorical representation of each battl=
e, each demon and godess involved in Saptashati so one would reflect on the=
mselves while reciting and make a conscious effort to conquer those interna=
l enemies, and I ran into this post dated May 13, 2006.  Thought of sharing=
 with the members.

aptashatidevi-mahatmyam.html

Also Digest Number 696, has more on surata an=
d samadhi.  

Narasimha garu, if you choose to shed more light on Saptashat=
i, that would be wonderful too.  

Thank you,
-Sunitha
