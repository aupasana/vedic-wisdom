Hi,

I know the analogies are intended for easing out the understanding. Ho=
w ever, I have few observations regarding the analogies.

1. In all the anl=
ogies, we know what it feels like when we reach the goal. We know what it i=
s like to have a Job. We know what it is like to reach the bank. We also kn=
ow how made not reaching the goal. No job, typically means no money and res=
ults normally in misery. No reaching sea bank normally means death out of s=
tarvation. But, the same is not the case with spiritual jouney.

Most of us=
 do not know what it is to see God. After all, if I finally realise and God=
 and merge, there is no more happyness/sadness. It is supposed to be a stat=
e of Nirguna. Also, we hear so much that we should strive to treat happynes=
s/saddness, praise/disgrace equally. If one can react to sadness as one do =
to happyness, there is no further problem. God or no God, such a state is d=
efinitely good to be in. But, this also means, I do not enjoy happyness. Wh=
at is the difference between an non living being and me in such a case?

2.=
 In sea, when you have to row a long distance to reach a bank, you have lim=
ited energy left with you. So, the key is not to loose hope and courageand =
reevaluate the strategy to reach the bank faster. At times, it may be best =
to sleep that row against wind. The key to to get maximum return for the en=
ergy you spend since you have limited energy left with you. It depends how =
close you are from bank. If I can see bank, then perhaps rowing with my ful=
l strength may be a good idea, but, if I know for sure, I am very far from =
bank, I am bettere off letting wind take me some where and concentrate on s=
urving for longer - I may use my strength to find some food for me than row=
ing and weaking myself.

Best regards,
Vijay

 Suppose you are trying to sail your boat in the ocean to a bank. Suppose a=
 really heavy wind is blowing. You can leave it to the wind to take you the=
re or you can row the boat actively. As wind changes your course, you const=
antly re-evaluate how you should row and row the boat in such a way that yo=
u finally reach the bank. Because wind is so heavy and sometimes overcomes =
your rowing, you cannot say that your rowing is not needed. If you do not r=
ow well, wind may keep you going in circles within the ocean and you may no=
t reach the bank. You keep doing your best to row in the correct direction.=
 If wind took you in a wrong direction, you do not stop rowing and start cr=
ying. Then wind may push you further in a wrong direction! Irrespective of =
the outcome, the best strategy is to keep re-evaluating how to row and keep=
 rowing.
>  
> If you start rowing harder than before and yet wind is also =
blowing harder than before and you are not making progress, do not stop row=
ing. If you do, you may go back further. Keep rowing. Remember that wind do=
es not blow the same way always!!! If you keep rowing, your time will come =
when your rowing will be productive. A time may also come when wind pushes =
you in the correct direction. So, just row row row your boat...
