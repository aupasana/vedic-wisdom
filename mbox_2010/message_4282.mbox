I realized that the last mail was sent prematurely. I finished one point in=
 this version.
------------------------------------
Namaste friends,
 
Nice=
 writeup. As long as one remains in duality, there is always a chance of be=
ing deluded. However, with due respect, I wish to make a *critical* note wi=
th my 2 cents on various realted and unrelated issues. Please allow me.
 
>=
  Because of the ignorance of the mind experiencing a sense of difference
>=
 [bheda-buddhi] in Self, [even] great devas are disturbed by fear.
> [There=
fore] it is wise to remain without fear in the supreme state of
> non-duali=
ty, having attained the reality, one=E2=80=99s own Self, through negation
>=
 [of the non-Self].
 
It is certainly wise to "remain without fear in the s=
upreme state of non-duality". However, as you pointed out, "[even] great de=
vas are disturbed by fear". Then how easy can it be for other beings, inclu=
ding members of this list, to "remain without fear in the supreme state of =
non-duality"?
 
Please don't get me wrong. I am not against adwaita or non-=
duality at all, as those familiar with my writings should know by now. But =
I accept the fact that a huge majority of spiritual seekers are meant to re=
main in duality for many many more lives. A message other than "attain the =
supreme state of non-duality" may be more useful to them at their current s=
tage!
 
*        *        *
 
A great cricket batsman may not make the grea=
test coach. Hitting the ball may seem so easy to him and he may simply say,=
 "look at the ball and hit it." That much instruction is certainly not enou=
gh for a budding player to start playing like that great player.
 
Another =
gifted coach may observe faults in the technique of the budding player and =
give some tips. That may turn out to be more useful than the inspiring word=
s from the great player! Of course, no matter how good instructions one get=
s, the budding player may not play like that great player anytime soon! Nev=
ertheless, his goal should be to keep improving!
 
*        *        *
 
So=
me great teachers, especially of the Adwaita philosophy, are like the great=
 cricket batsman in the above analogy. They tell you what is obvious and na=
tural to *them*. Their words are very inspiring.
 
Some other teachers fine=
-tune their message for an audience. They show a real path (instead of a lo=
fty target) using which one can start making progress. One may or may not r=
each a supreme state anytime soon, but one will start making progress.
 
* =
       *        *
 
Different spiritual teachers come for different purpose=
s. The role played by each one is important in its own right. Ramana mahars=
hi was undoubtedly a great master. However, when it comes to the second cat=
egory of teachers I mentioned above, one name that strikes to me instantly =
is that of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. He was a master at fine-tuning his mess=
age for the individual. While most great masters were adepts in one path (j=
naana yoga or bhakti yoga or karma yoga or raja yoga), he was unique in tha=
t he experienced the supreme through each path and was equally comfortable =
guiding people in jnaana, vedanta, Raama bhakti, Krishna bhakti, Kaali bhak=
ti, Shiva bhakti, karma yoga, service, hatha yoga, tantra etc, having exper=
ienced all. He even did smashana sadhanas, Islamic sadhanas and experienced=
 Jesus Christ. He is a unique teacher in the last few millennia. Many other=
 masters take disciples on the path they walked. Having walked all paths to=
 the summit, Ramakrishna guided disciples on different paths based on their=
 aptitude.
 
*        *        *
 
Though upanishads and Bhagavad Gita are =
teaching Adwaita clearly, some great masters came in the last few millennia=
 who taught variations in the Upanishadic philosophy veering towards dualit=
y to various degrees. I think this happened for a purpose. As true Adwaita =
as taught by Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita becomes more and more inappropria=
te and difficult for the masses, a simpler message that they can understand=
 and that can guide their spiritual lives is needed. I think the coming of =
various masters who taught different philosophies is for that reason.
 
*  =
      *        *
 
The title of the mail was "Fearlessness Comes In The Sup=
reme State Of Non-duality". However, the question is: Does non-duality brin=
g fearlessness or vice versa?
 
A realization of non-dual Self may suddenly=
 happen oneday for some rare persons. For most, it happens as a result of s=
adhana done over many years/lives. Thus, qualities like dispassion, fearles=
sness (which are associated with the supreme state) need to be cultivated a=
ctively. As they become more and more perfected, one gets closer and closer=
 to Self-realization.
 
Suppose one sees a beautiful/ugly object (or a desi=
rable/undesirable object). When one feels attraction/aversion, one should r=
emind oneself "all is god (Self). There is no need for feeling attraction/a=
version towards anything." When one feels fear, one should remind oneself "=
all is god (Self). There is no need for be afraid of *anything*". As one pr=
actices this, one's dispassion and fearlessness increase. Incidents of delu=
sion becomes smaller and less frequent. Eventually, one overcomes.
 
But th=
e tricky part is that one needs to perform the actions one is meant to perf=
orm and work out the kaarmik debts, before one realizes Self. It is very di=
fficult to perform actions without feeling even small amounts of attachment=
, attraction, aversion, passion, fear etc.
 
A simple formula is: Give all =
you can and expect nothing (and accept whatever you get) in return. In the =
beginning, any attraction/aversion/anxiety/fear you feel should be with reg=
ard to what are giving to others and not with regard to what you are expect=
ing from others.
 
*        *        *
 
It is all easy to write and read t=
heory. The problem comes when one is tested in real life. For example, I ch=
oked when eating something once when I was alone and could not breathe. I b=
ecame anxious and it made it worse. Suddenly, the thought came to me "what =
are you afraid of? Death? This will mostly result in a little suffering for=
 a couple of minutes and no more. EVEN IF it results in death, what is the =
big deal? Jaatasya dhruvam mrityuh (each being who is born is sure of deatt=
h). Is there anything I wanted to do and could not do? Well, there may be, =
but someone else can do it. Why should only Narasimha do it? World will run=
 perfectly fine even if I am not here. If I indeed die now, why don't I med=
itate and focus my mind on god, instead of focusing on my life and getting =
anxious?" I relaxed and meditated for a few minutes with Gayatri mantra. My=
 anxiety went away and I felt nice after a while.
 
As one detects and acti=
vely suppresses undesirable thoughts more and more, such thoughts will beco=
me less and less frequent and eventually be suppressed by the mind even in =
the seed/formatory state. Later, causes of those seeds themselves will be w=
iped out from the sub-conscious mind. This is how conditioning of the mind =
is slowly overcome. It is certainly a long process for most of us, but one =
loses nothing by starting and trying to make progress. Sadhanas like homam =
and japam aid one in this.
 
Please note that even Ramana maharshi and Rama=
krishna Paramahamsa did intense sadhana for many years, before they could r=
each the supreme state. No matter who you are, some sadhana is needed.
 
* =
       *        *
 
While on the topic of Adwaita, I want to make one more =
point. It poses two dangers. While the Ultimate Reality is indeed non-dual,=
 *half-baked* understanding of Adwaita philosophy can make one *trivialize*=
 duality on one extreme or *glorify* ignorance on the other extreme. Let me=
 explain.
 
Reading that the ultimate reality behind all that we see is the=
 non-dual Self can make some people trivialize the duality that we normally=
 experience. If duality is "mithya" (an illusion), how does it matter and h=
ow do our actions within it matter? It is all, after all, an illusion.
 
Of=
 course, a true student of vedanta will know that the layer of illusion is =
quite important and cannot be ignored simply because it is an "illusion". I=
f one's consciousness is veiled by the layer of illusion, actions within th=
at layer of illusion are required for removing it. It will not magically di=
sappear. After all, yoga vaasishtham emphasizes "actions" in the dual world=
 for realizing non-dual Self. Action and knowledge as the two wings with wh=
ich the bird of individualized consciousness rises from the ground of duali=
ty to reach the sky of true Self.
 
*        *        *
 
On the other extr=
eme, some people take "all is god/Self" to justify anything they do. Their =
desires, passions, attractions, aversions etc are all stamped as "Self". Th=
ey think "I am Self/god and whatever I think and do is Self/God".
 
As any =
truly learned person will know, that is true at one level and misleading at=
 another. Everything is Self, in the sense that good and bad things, desira=
ble and undesirable things are all Self in reality. However, if one sees (w=
ithin one's mind) different aspects of Self with a different vision, then b=
heda-bhava (perception of difference) is not gone yet and that creates karm=
a. One reaps what one sows.
 
Irrespective of what one says and pretends, w=
hat one has in the mind matters. If one pursued something thinking it to be=
 desirable and if one avoided something thinking it to be undesirable, one =
will get the fruits for it. Of course, the fruits are also Self only, but o=
ne will invariably see them as tasty and bitter fruits when one actually re=
ceives them. Thus, pretending that all if Self is useless.
 
Bottomline: As=
 long as your consciousness perceives duality, neither trivialize it nor pr=
etend that all is Self. Instead, engage in the right actions to wade the oc=
ean of duality. 
 
*        *        *
 
Enough for now. I have not gone an=
ywhere and still reading the list regularly. But I did not have motivation =
to reply to any recent mails. Basically, if I have no useful or meaningful =
comment/reply, I keep quiet.
 
Intellectual exchanges are interesting, but =
the thing that matters at the end of the day is whether we are doing sincer=
e sadhana or not and whether we are progressing or not. It seems to me like=
 several people are sincerely doing homam/japam and sincerely trying to mak=
e progress. Several more people are about to do the same. THAT is what real=
ly matters. What we think or say about the world, duality and non-duality i=
s irrelevant really. What matters is whether our attitude is changing for t=
he better.
 
*        *        *
 
Let me give one more quick analogy befor=
e I stop for now.
 
Suppose one is sleeping and seeing an elaborate dream. =
Suppose one is fully absorbed in the dream and weeping in pain when somethi=
ng bad happens in the dream and laughing in elation when something good hap=
pens in the dream. One can tell that it is bad.
 
Suppose another person ha=
s read *in the dream* that what one is experiencing is called a "dream" and=
 will end soon and what happens in the dream is irrelevant. Suppose one int=
ellectually understands all that and yet weeps in pain when something bad h=
appens in the dream and laughs in elation when something good happens in th=
e dream. Is that any better? Of course not.
 
On the other hand, if one is =
slowly getting control over the mind and not weeping as often and not laugh=
ing as often, one is perhaps making progress.
 
*        *        *
 
Do wh=
atever your conscience tells you to do. But expect nothing in return and ac=
cept whatever comes to you as a result. As your acceptance increases, the c=
larity with which your conscience shows you the path you should take (with =
regard to your actions) will become better and better. If your actions were=
 bad in the past (due to unclear guidelines from conscience or not followin=
g your conscience) and you are receiving bad fruits, you can still overcome=
 it by learning to accept what comes. As your acceptance is perfected, your=
 conscience and will power will become pure and your actions will become pu=
re. As actions become pure, newer fruits will be pure. Eventually, you star=
t making progress.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
