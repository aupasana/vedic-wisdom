Karma: A Principle of Radical Freedom

By Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya

"S=
ince the popularization of the term "karma" in the Western world from the 1=
960s to the present day, this important metaphysical and ethical concept ha=
s, unfortunately, been understood in only the most simplistic and cursory o=
f manners by the majority of Europeans and Americans =96 including by schol=
ars, by most self-professed spiritual teachers, as well as by many common s=
piritual practitioners. Many followers of 'New Age' and pop spirituality ha=
ve an even more speculative understanding of karma, believing that the conc=
ept of karma is somehow tied to the idea of fate or predetermination. As we=
 will see, the concept of karma in no way represents either a "fatalistic" =
or a "pre-deterministic" view of the cosmos. Rather, it is a logical and et=
hically rooted science of activity, a metaphysics of action. Karma is, in a=
ctuality, a principle of radical personal freedom. Given the many misconcep=
tions that abound in the modern mind concerning the nature of karma, we wil=
