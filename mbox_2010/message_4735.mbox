(Introduction by Sri Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi)

This work is one of the upa=
-agamas and explains the supreme wisdom to be
attained by mature souls and =
their mode of life, expounded by the Supreme
Lord Siva to Devi Parvati.It i=
s the essence of all Agama Sastras on matters
of spiritual knowledge. This =
is verily the boat which can rescue the mortals
struggling hard, sinking an=
d rising, in the sorrowful ocean of samsara of
endless cycles of births and=
 deaths and take them by the direct path to the
shore of liberation. Let al=
l earnest seekers after Truth, instead of groping
in the dark, bewildered, =
and losing their way, adopt the help of this
straight path and reach the su=
preme state to bliss and peace.

Invocation

Meditate in the Heart upon Lor=
d Ganesa =E2=80=94 the silent,non-dual, universal
witness =E2=80=94 who is =
the nectar of divine bliss and is full of grace, shining as
the bountiful f=
lowering of aspirants following the path of spiritual wisdom
revealed in De=
vikalottara, which was expounded by Lord Ishwara into the ears
of Goddess I=
shwari.

Note: In the original Tamil verse, the word =E2=80=98kari=E2=80=99=
 means =E2=80=98elephant=E2=80=99, which
denotes Lord Ganesa as per traditi=
on, but the word =E2=80=98kari=E2=80=99 also means
=E2=80=98witness=E2=80=
=99, which denotes the Universal Self, which is in line with Advaitic
exper=
ience.

The Text

Devi :

1. O Lord of all celestial beings! I yearn to kno=
w that path of supreme
wisdom and the code of conduct by adopting which one=
 can get liberation, so
that all humanity may attain salvation. I request y=
ou to enlighten me on
them, out of your grace.

Ishwara :

2. O Queen among=
 women! So that everyone may attain knowledge, I shall
clearly explain to y=
ou today the highest knowledge and the discipline to be
followed by which
d=
iscerning seekers will attain liberation, which is free from any blemish
an=
d is difficult to describe.

3. O Lady with fair countenance! Understand th=
at one who is not able to
realise the Truth in his Heart by this knowledge =
of spiritual wisdom known
as Kala Jnana, can
never attain it even by studyi=
ng countless crores of sastras (scriptures)
spread out like the sky.

4. Th=
erefore cast aside all fears (on following this path) and shed all
doubts. =
Giving up attachment or desire for anything, be ardent in seeking
the ultim=
ate knowledge with wholehearted devotion and with a clear mind
(without any=
 trace of confusion).

5. Claiming nothing as =E2=80=98mine=E2=80=99, fille=
d with compassion,giving protection to
all living beings so that no creatur=
e fears you, yearning for liberation,
absorbed in yoga (union of jiva and P=
ara, fusion of individual self with the
universal Self),study this work Dev=
ikalottara and follow wholeheartedly and
steadfastly the single path shown =
therein.

6-7. If one is to describe the person who can bring under control=
 his mind,
which is restless and turbulent like a whirlwind, and maintain i=
t in a
tranquil state, he is verily Brahma (the God that does the creation)=
, Siva
(the saviour who shows the path to salvation) and Vishnu (the sustai=
ner of
the world); he is Indra, King of the devas, and Lord Subrahmanya (ch=
ief
commander of all the celestial forces);he is Brihaspati, the guru of al=
l
devas; he is a supreme yogi, and one who has achieved the result of
perfo=
rming all austerities; he is a great scholar (who has mastered all the
Veda=
s and sastras), and an outstanding man; he is one who has achieved the
true=
 spiritual goal.

8-9. The means by which this mind, which is restless and =
moves about quicker
than the wind, can be brought under control, is indeed =
the means to obtain
liberation; it indeed is what is good for those who see=
k the permanent
Reality; it itself is Pure Consciousness and the state of f=
irmness;
moreover, it alone is the righteous duty to be followed by discern=
ing
aspirants; it alone is the pilgrimage to holy waters;
it alone is chari=
ty; it alone is austerities. Know that there is no doubt
about this.

10. W=
hen the mind moves even a little, that is samsara (worldly bondage);
when t=
he mind abides firmly and motionlessly (in the state of Self), that is
mukt=
i (liberation).This is certain. Therefore know that the wise man must
hold =
his mind firm by supreme Self-awareness.

11. The happiness attained in thi=
s aloneness is the highest,boundless bliss.
Which learned persons will not =
revel in that Supreme Reality, in which there
is absolutely no action? Tell=
 me.

12. Being rid of the worldly knowledge, the great hero who has acquir=
ed pure
wisdom, in which there are no sense objects, and which is all perva=
ding and
without any form,
will attain immutable moksha without fail, even =
though he may have no desire
to attain liberation.

13. The consciousness (=
chaitanya) associated with the aspect =E2=80=98am=E2=80=99 is called
Sakti.=
 The universe shines by its light.The entire creation is Sakti=E2=80=99s
sa=
nkalpa (thought). The state (of mind) which is completely devoid of all
att=
achment is the pure (wisdom) to be attained.

14. The void which is the inf=
inite and all-encompassing one whole without a
second, which is just the ef=
fulgence of pure wisdom, which is completely
devoid of visible
phenomena an=
d which consists of the aspect =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 is the seed which fructi=
fies
as liberation, bestowing salvation by enabling one to unite with the
S=
upreme.

15. Instead of following this direct path, do not ever contemplate=
 even in
the least upon chakras (located in six adharas, centres in the bod=
y), nadis
(subtle nerves that produce the ten divine sounds such as Pranava=
), the
deities associated with the lotus seats (in the adhara chakras, begi=
nning
with Vinayaka), the mantraksharas (potent sound syllables for the wor=
ship of
these deities) and the diverse mandala murtis (the
God-aspects, sta=
rting from those controlling the sun, Surya Mandala, the
moon, Chandra Mand=
ala, and fire, Agni mandala).

Note: Some aspirants indulge in severe auste=
rities and arduous practices,
mastering several techniques and incidentally=
 attaining extraordinary
supernatural powers as
well. All these are to be s=
hunned as they do not lead to ultimate peace and
joy. On the other hand, th=
e path of Kala Jnana described here is a direct
path to mukti.

16. Those w=
ho seek everlasting liberation need not endeavour to practise
repetition an=
d countless verse mantras (repeating potent scriptural words or
texts to ga=
in various ends), and methods of yoga such as breath-control
(pranayama), b=
reath retention (kumbhaka) and concentration.

17. There is no room for per=
forming puja (worship of deities), namaskaram
(paying homage like prostrati=
on), japa (incantation), dhyana (contemplation)
and so on. Hear from me tha=
t the highest truth acclaimed in the Vedas can be
known only through jnana;=
 hence, there is absolutely no need to know
anything outside of oneself.

1=
8. For those whose minds are constantly expanding, clinging to external
obj=
ects, factors will always arise causing increasing bondage. If the
outward-=
wandering mind is turned inwards to stay in its natural state, know
that on=
e will not undergo any suffering in the world.

19. Unite with that one tot=
ality, which is all-pervasive,which has no inside
or outside, which is bere=
ft of all (concept of) directions such as above,
below and in between, whic=
h assumes all the forms in creation and yet is
itself formless,which can be=
 known only by itself, and which is
self-luminous.

20. People perform thei=
r actions having their own aims in mind, and they
accordingly reap the cons=
equences of their actions by attaining those aims.
Therefore do not engage =
in such actions which are not free from flaws
(leading to bondage). Turn th=
e attention completely away from external
objects and concentrate only upon=
 that (the Self) which cannot be seen.

21. In our natural state, actions, =
cause and result of such actions, and all
the various other theories propou=
nded (in the scriptures) do not exist. In
fact, even the diverse world does=
 not exist. As such even the worldly
individual who is attached
to (the var=
ious attractions of) the world is also nonexistent.

22. This entire univer=
se is nothing but the niralamba (the reality which
exists without any suppo=
rt). Further, it shines being illumined by the
niralamba. The yogi (with hi=
s mind turned inward) merges with this whole one
by making every object in =
this world one with it. Know this.

23. If any person does not meditate on =
this great allpervading void, which
is the space of consciousness (chidakas=
a), he will be a samsari (a worldly
individual) forever in bondage to world=
ly attachments, like the silkworm in
its self made cocoon. Understand this.=


24. All living beings, of whatever genus, undergo great misery over and o=
ver
again. Hear from me. In order to avert all this suffering and sorrow,
m=
editate on the great void constantly without any break.

25. Good actions a=
nd good conduct have been prescribed only to guide the
seeker towards the p=
ath of acquiring knowledge. Therefore, giving up even
salamba yoga in which=
 an object (such as a mantra or a form of God) is
meditated upon in the min=
d, stay steadfast in your real state (sahaja
swarupa), where the outside wo=
rld is not perceived.

Note: Actions prescribed include worship of Siva in =
one=E2=80=99s mind as well as
outside. The various ceremonies prescribed in=
 Agama Sastras for worshipping
Siva in saguna form in a temple are covered =
in good conduct.

26. One who can destroy all the tattvas (principles) from=
 patalaloka (the
nethermost world) to Sakti (one of the highest tattvas), w=
hich are all
interdependent, by the arrow of sunyabhava is a man of great v=
alour. He has
attained supreme wisdom which is beyond matter.

Note: ln sun=
yabhava the individual is only aware of his conscious being
while everythin=
g else is like a void (sunya) =E2=80=94 without existence.

27. The mind, h=
ankering after things of the world, is more restless than a
monkey. If one =
controls it from wandering after external things and holds it
in the void o=
f non-matter one will attain liberation directly.

28. The full Consciousne=
ss (purna chit) which is not other than the true
import of the word =E2=80=
=98I=E2=80=99, being non-different in all the principles (tattvas)
and bein=
g other than the sense =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99, is the all-pervadin=
g
Reality.

29. This complete wholeness pervades inside and outside all cre=
ations like
ether, merging with them, and is itself formless. Dear, those w=
ho are
submerged in this supreme bliss become that supreme bliss themselves=
. See,
how wonderful!

30. The expanding mind will attain peace, becoming s=
till of its own accord,
if it is deprived of something to hold on,just as f=
ire gets extinguished
gradually if not fed with fuel.

31. You must realise=
 that the four states of infatuation,delusion, swoon
(due to shock) and dre=
aming, as also sleeping and waking, are all to be
dispelled.

32. If one me=
ditates that the one Consciousness (chit) is different from the
prana (life=
-force), which has subtly attached itself to this gross body,
from the mind=
, from the intellect and from the ego, one will become
established in that =
Consciousness.

33. Due to sleep and due to thoughts the mind always loses =
its sharpness,
its foolishness increases, and it goes to ruin. Awakening th=
is mind with
effort, and without allowing it to wander, establish it in the=
 state of
Self. Persevere in this effort by fixing the mind again and again=
 in its
natural state.

34. When once the mind becomes steady, it should no=
t be disturbed in any
way. There is no need to think even in the least of a=
nything else,
entertaining any doubts. Fixing the mind firmly in that state=
 (of
Self-awareness), keep it still.

35. Make the mind, which always cling=
s to some support (attaching itself to
sense-objects), devoid of all such s=
upports. Making the mind, which is
restless in clinging to external support=
s, motionless, do not disturb that
tranquillity even a little.

36. Meditat=
e on the peerless Self which pervades all the various forms, yet
remains wi=
thout any blemish (being unaffected by them), just as ether,
pervading all =
the creations made up of the five elements, remains unsullied
at the time o=
f
their dissolution.

37. When one adopts the practice (sadhana) by means o=
f which one=E2=80=99s mind,
which is restless like the wind, is made still =
perpetually, then the purpose
of taking birth as a human being is fulfilled=
. That is also the mark of a
true scholar.

38. Do not practise meditation =
by fixing the mind on the six adhara chakras,
the ones that are up or down =
or in the middle, or anywhere else. Giving up
all such meditations, make th=
e mind always devoid of any support (either
inside or outside).

39. If the=
 mind falls asleep, awaken it. Then if it starts wandering, make
it quiet. =
If you reach the state where there is neither sleep nor movement
of mind, s=
tay still in that, the natural (real) state.

40. The state in which the mi=
nd is bereft of any support to cling to, ever
faultless and pure, and devoi=
d of worldly attachments, is the nature of
liberation attained through know=
ledge. Keep this firmly in mind.

41. Dispelling all attachments completely=
, and fixing that mind in the Heart
firmly, persist in your practice always=
 in order to strengthen the
awareness, which then shines forth with great e=
ffulgence and clarity.

42. Know that whoever meditates on that supreme voi=
d,and becomes established
in it by virtue of constant practice,will definit=
ely attain the great state
which is beyond birth and death.

43. Gods and g=
oddesses, merits, demerits and their fruits, which are
likewise anya (other=
 than oneself), objects of attachment and the knowledge
of those objects =
=E2=80=94 all these will lead one to bondage in mighty samsara.

44. All ob=
jects of attachments are said to be pairs of opposites (happiness
and miser=
y, good and bad, profit and loss, victory and defeat, and so on).
When one =
rises above those pairs of opposites, one realises the Supreme.
Such a yogi=
 is a jivanmukta, liberated from bondage. On discarding the body,
he become=
s a videhamukta.

ve, below and in between, which assumes all the forms in creation and yet i=
s itself formless,which can be known only by itself, and which is self-lumi=
nous.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">20. People perform their ac=
tions having their own aims in mind, and they accordingly reap the conseque=
nces of their actions by attaining those aims. Therefore do not engage in s=
uch actions which are not free from flaws (leading to bondage). Turn the at=
tention completely away from external objects and concentrate only upon tha=
t (the Self) which cannot be seen.</span><br>

<br>21. In our natural state=
, actions, cause and result of such actions, and all the various other theo=
ries propounded (in the scriptures) do not exist. In fact, even the diverse=
 world does not exist. As such even the worldly individual who is attached<=
br>

to (the various attractions of) the world is also nonexistent.<br><br>=
22. This entire universe is nothing but the niralamba (the reality which ex=
ists without any support). Further, it shines being illumined by the nirala=
mba. The yogi (with his mind turned inward) merges with this whole one by m=
aking every object in this world one with it. Know this.<br>

<br><span sty=
le=3D"font-weight:bold">23. If any person does not meditate on this great a=
llpervading void, which is the space of consciousness (chidakasa), he will =
be a samsari (a worldly individual) forever in bondage to worldly attachmen=
ts, like the silkworm in its self made cocoon. Understand this.</span><br>
=

<br>24. All living beings, of whatever genus, undergo great misery over an=
d over again. Hear from me. In order to avert all this suffering and sorrow=
, meditate on the great void constantly without any break.<br><br>25. Good =
actions and good conduct have been prescribed only to guide the seeker towa=
rds the path of acquiring knowledge. Therefore, giving up even salamba yoga=
 in which an object (such as a mantra or a form of God) is meditated upon i=
n the mind, stay steadfast in your real state (sahaja swarupa), where the o=
utside world is not perceived.<br>

<br>Note: Actions prescribed include wo=
rship of Siva in one=E2=80=99s mind as well as outside. The various ceremon=
ies prescribed in Agama Sastras for worshipping Siva in saguna form in a te=
mple are covered in good conduct.<br><br>

26. One who can destroy all the =
tattvas (principles) from patalaloka (the nethermost world) to Sakti (one o=
f the highest tattvas), which are all interdependent, by the arrow of sunya=
bhava is a man of great valour. He has attained supreme wisdom which is bey=
ond matter.<br>

<br>Note: ln sunyabhava the individual is only aware of hi=
s conscious being while everything else is like a void (sunya) =E2=80=94 wi=
thout existence.<br><br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">27. The mind, hank=
ering after things of the world, is more restless than a monkey. If one con=
trols it from wandering after external things and holds it in the void of n=
on-matter one will attain liberation directly.</span><br>

<br>28. The full=
 Consciousness (purna chit) which is not other than the true import of the =
word =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, being non-different in all the principles (tattva=
s) and being other than the sense =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99, is the a=
ll-pervading Reality.<br>

<br>29. This complete wholeness pervades inside =
and outside all creations like ether, merging with them, and is itself form=
less. Dear, those who are submerged in this supreme bliss become that supre=
me bliss themselves. See, how wonderful!<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weigh=
t:bold">30. The expanding mind will attain peace, becoming still of its own=
 accord, if it is deprived of something to hold on,just as fire gets exting=
uished gradually if not fed with fuel.</span><br>

<br>31. You must realise=
 that the four states of infatuation,delusion, swoon (due to shock) and dre=
aming, as also sleeping and waking, are all to be dispelled.<br><br>32. If =
one meditates that the one Consciousness (chit) is different from the prana=
 (life-force), which has subtly attached itself to this gross body, from th=
e mind, from the intellect and from the ego, one will become established in=
 that Consciousness.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">33. Due to s=
leep and due to thoughts the mind always loses its sharpness, its foolishne=
ss increases, and it goes to ruin. Awakening this mind with effort, and wit=
hout allowing it to wander, establish it in the state of Self. Persevere in=
 this effort by fixing the mind again and again in its natural state.</span=
><br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">34. When once the mind becomes =
steady, it should not be disturbed in any way. There is no need to think ev=
en in the least of anything else, entertaining any doubts. Fixing the mind =
firmly in that state (of Self-awareness), keep it still.</span><br>

<br><s=
pan style=3D"font-weight:bold">35. Make the mind, which always clings to so=
me support (attaching itself to sense-objects), devoid of all such supports=
. Making the mind, which is restless in clinging to external supports, moti=
onless, do not disturb that tranquillity even a little.</span><br>

<br>36.=
 Meditate on the peerless Self which pervades all the various forms, yet re=
mains without any blemish (being unaffected by them), just as ether, pervad=
ing all the creations made up of the five elements, remains unsullied at th=
e time of<br>

their dissolution.<br><br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">3=
7. When one adopts the practice (sadhana) by means of which one=E2=80=99s m=
ind, which is restless like the wind, is made still perpetually, then the p=
urpose of taking birth as a human being is fulfilled.</span>=C2=A0That is a=
lso the mark of a true scholar.<br>

<br>38. Do not practise meditation by =
fixing the mind on the six adhara chakras, the ones that are up or down or =
in the middle, or anywhere else. Giving up all such meditations, make the m=
ind always devoid of any support (either inside or outside).<br>

<br><span=
 style=3D"font-weight:bold">39. If the mind falls asleep, awaken it. Then i=
f it starts wandering, make it quiet. If you reach the state where there is=
 neither sleep nor movement of mind, stay still in that, the natural (real)=
 state.</span><br>

<br>40. The state in which the mind is bereft of any su=
pport to cling to, ever faultless and pure, and devoid of worldly attachmen=
ts, is the nature of liberation attained through knowledge. Keep this firml=
y in mind.<br><br>

41. Dispelling all attachments completely, and fixing t=
hat mind in the Heart firmly, persist in your practice always in order to s=
trengthen the awareness, which then shines forth with great effulgence and =
clarity.<br><br>

42. Know that whoever meditates on that supreme void,and =
becomes established in it by virtue of constant practice,will definitely at=
tain the great state which is beyond birth and death.<br><br>43. Gods and g=
oddesses, merits, demerits and their fruits, which are likewise anya (other=
 than oneself), objects of attachment and the knowledge of those objects =
=E2=80=94 all these will lead one to bondage in mighty samsara.<br>

<br><s=
pan style=3D"font-weight:bold">44. All objects of attachments are said to b=
e pairs of opposites (happiness and misery, good and bad, profit and loss, =
victory and defeat, and so on). When one rises above those pairs of opposit=
es, one realises the Supreme. Such a yogi is a jivanmukta, liberated from b=
ondage. On discarding the body, he becomes a videhamukta.</span><br>
