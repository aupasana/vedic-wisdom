Aditi ji 

As Rajarishi ji and Narasimha ji have already answered most of y=
our questions ,just wanted to share some additional thoughts. I do the homa=
 on the balcony of my house and was intially only concerned about dust fall=
ing into the fire. I use an room divider as protection against strong gusts=
 of wind and dust. 

It is just my personal experience that homa done outsi=
de somehow feels much more stronger and peaceful and also I get to enjoy a =
much bigger fire . When I used to do it inside always used to be concerned =
about the smoke alarm going off and instead of focussing on the homa used t=
o be focussed on managing a smaller fire with coconut pieces.

Also it give=
s me happiness in thinking am able to serve Lord ganapati with much more of=
ferings in a big fire outside.

my two cents.

Regards
Vemparla Ram Kishore=
