Respected Narasimha Ji and Manish Ji,

Please accept my Regards.
Thanks for=
 clarifying my doubt.

In ancient times, and scriptures like Charak samhita=
 etc, it was considered ethical for patient to bring something for the doct=
or from him who is getting treatment. Another thing was there that there we=
re no strict fees for the services. Patient was free to pay whatever he can=
 afford or is pleased to offer. Sometimes it was money, or grains, or veget=
ables or raw drugs-roots-fruits etc whatever the patient can give. And it w=
as ethics on the side of doctor to accept whatever he is being given or eve=
n if he is not paid anything at all.

In later days, this dis-similar fee s=
tructure did lead to abuse. As we discussed in another mail that with chang=
ing times nature tend to change the infrastructure and operating methods. S=
o a pattern of similar fees came in to light. Obviously, this is also being=
 abused now a days. 

It is surely immoral and a bad karma to charge money =
much more than appropriate.

But it is surely a concern that how to decide =
the 'cost of medicine'

In Pvt practice, with time, number of families bein=
g fed from the practice increases upto 20 to 30 on average. 
With increasin=
g complexities in medicine it is necessary to pump money in the system regu=
larly to accommodate new researches, updates, latest facilities etc.

Is th=
e answer to this is to do a detached karma? and to work without a  sense of=
 'doer ship'?

Kind Regards
Atul
