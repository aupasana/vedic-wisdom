Namaste,

Samaadhi asked the above boon and did =
NOT ask for Family and such perishables and so did he get the boon of 'Anaa=
sakt Budhhi'

That answers as well as to why he is named as 'Samaadhi'. He =
had already suffered one of the most cruel blow and that is desertion by ow=
n wife, children and near ones for MONEY and that actually makes an already=
 inclined person, first extremely sad and secondly bolts him to a path whic=
h leads to Samaadhi.

It reminds me of Adi Shankara's famous lines from 'Bh=
ajagovindam'
