bject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] On Shakti (Re: Success with Mantras)

   
Namaste=
,
 
I find a few contradition in your position. Let me explain. Before I st=
art, let 
me also clarify that I am not a Vedantin, neither am I an anti-Ve=
dantin.  I 
belong to no specific path/sect. I take what I find reasonable,=
 logic and 
acceptable, irrespective of where it comes from. 
 
Technically=
 the core philosophy of Vedanta is realization of the statement Aham 
Brahm=
asmi (personally I have a logical issue with this statement, but that is 
a=
 different discussion). Ignoraning the body is merely of secondary conseque=
nce. 
So theoritically, if someday someone is able to attain perfect physic=
al 
immortality, he/she too cannot be called a non-vedantin if he as realiz=
ed Aham 
Brahmasmi. 

 
Is the physical body important? My person take is t=
hat, sure it is. Without this 
vehicle nothing is achievable. Therefore it =
is important.
 
The Bhagavad Gita, is a text, not from a Vedic Rishi, but a=
 Vedantist Vishnu 
Avatara.
 
A Vishnu Avatar is God for all practical purp=
oses, including the description and 
status accorded to Krishna as the Purn=
a Avatara - one who cannot be replicated 
by anyone else on this plane. Thi=
s even Lahiri Mahasaya accepts, just as pretty 
much everbody who is anybod=
y, does.
Just as I mentioned that Mahavatara Babaji does not speak of physi=
cal 
immortality for anyone, same is the case for Krishna. Because that is =
not 
achieveable. 

 
There is a need to bring the Vedas to the mass consci=
ousness, to uplift the 
Physical consciousness from where it is now.
 
If b=
y this statement you mean Vedas are going to make people immortal, I have t=
o 
ask how. 

 
The Vedas today is merely a mass of different translations =
by different parties. 
Aurobindo even says that it is purely allegorical, h=
e mostly 
interpreted some selective hymns. Never in any of the hyms does t=
here exist any 
remote hint of any sort of physical immortality, merely des=
cribing different 
states of spiritual process internal to the sadhaka. The=
 other translations by 
other commentators also do not mention any sort of =
physical immortality at all.
 
Therefore, for complete lack of any evidence=
 from any quarter I shall have to 
assumed that vedas do not talk of any so=
rt of physical immortality.
 
Rishis wouldn't put the method for divinizing=
 the Physical body in plaintext, to 
disallow its misuse. It is for the per=
severing soul to find it out for himself 
or through the upliftment of mass=
 consciousness through Vedas.

Why Vedic Rishis wouldn't do it themselves, =
or if they did it, nobody would 
know,
 
There is no evidence that the Rish=
is become physically immortal in the body. You 
are *assuming* that Rishis =
*might have* put some hidden hint, but thats just an 
assumption. They may =
very well have not put any such hint about any physical 
immortality, speci=
ally since none of the Rishis themselves became physically 
immortal. For a=
n assumption to be reasonable, it must have some 
basis/hint/example. We fi=
nd no such conclusive examples in the history of 
Sanatana Dharma, except a=
 few stray cases like Ashwathama. 

 
Neither does any of the translation o=
f the Vedas by different people speak of 
any such state achievable. Techni=
cally someone who is physically immortal is one 
who stays in the body till=
 end of the cycle of creation. Even Babaji - who is 
supposedly physically =
immortal - does say that others cannot remain till the end 
of creation. So=
 the evidence, rather overwhelmingly, is against the existence or 
even pos=
siblity of such a state.
 
> Because if one is immortal in the physical bod=
y, one must survive in it till 
>the end of creation.
OTOH, a soul liberate=
d in Physical body, is no longer bound by the rules of 
creation as applica=
ble to mortal beings, who have to die despite all the jnana 
they attain.
 =

But strangely that is a state no one has achieved. Neither the seers of th=
e 
Vedas achieve it - there is no evidence anywhere that they did - nor did=
 
they recommend it to others. 

 
Even Babaji says only he will exist till=
 the end. And if your assumptions are 
correct, then Babaji has to be wrong=
!
 
I guess I just have to reject this notion for complete lack of any evid=
ence of 
the same, and peacefully, agree to disagree with you.
 
-Regards

Rajarshi

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] On Shakti (Re:=
 Success with Mantras)

  
Namaskar,
The aim of my mails is only to free th=
e minds of the reader from biases, caused 
by dominating propaganda of Veda=
ntists - that is to see the Physical body as 
something to be ignored for s=
piritual pursuit. Consequently, Vedantists 
themselves never found out the =
truth about the Physical body consciousness as an 
expression of divine con=
sciousness. The Bhagavad Gita, is a text, not from a 
Vedic Rishi, but a Ve=
dantist Vishnu Avatara.
There is a need to bring the Vedas to the mass cons=
ciousness, to uplift the 
Physical consciousness from where it is now.

Ris=
his wouldn't put the method for divinizing the Physical body in plaintext, =
to 
disallow its misuse. It is for the persevering soul to find it out for =
himself 
or through the upliftment of mass consciousness through Vedas.

Wh=
y Vedic Rishis wouldn't do it themselves, or if they did it, nobody would 
=
know, but they didn't live in Kaliyuga when the Physical body consciousness=
 is  
largely in focus, and therefore the need to divinize it as well. Trut=
h, however, 
is not limited to the Yuga when it is perceived, and is equall=
y applicable to 
all Yugas and Veda is that Truth.

> Because if one is imm=
ortal in the physical body, one must survive in it till 
>the end of creati=
on.
OTOH, a soul liberated in Physical body, is no longer bound by the rule=
s of 
creation as applicable to mortal beings, who have to die despite all =
the jnana 
they attain.

regards,
Aryama
