 Some People say "My love is not for myself; I work in this world not for m=
y
own happiness but for the welfare of other people. In fact, I live for
ot=
hers. To care only for my own happiness is selfishness =E2=80=93 that is no=
t my
aim. My aim is the happiness of others=E2=80=9D.

This is superficial =
talk, betraying a lack of sincere and serious analysis!
People do not reali=
ze that every so-called selfless act which they do brings
happiness only to=
 themselves!

Let us take the example of a man who is prepared to undergo,t=
hroughout his
lifetime, all kinds of sufferings for his son just to maintai=
n, educate, and
keep him above needs and wants; in doing so it is he alone =
who gets
satisfaction from seeing the prosperity of his son. He worked for =
this
satisfaction alone. Is not this satisfaction his own? Is not this
self=
-satisfaction the driving force behind all his socalled selfless work?

The=
 former American President Abraham Lincoln once saved a pig by lifting it
o=
ut of the mire in which it was caught, and while doing so his body and
clot=
hes became very dirty. The onlookers asked him why he, the president of
suc=
h a vast country, should dirty himself just to save a common pig. He
replie=
d : =E2=80=9CI got involved in this action not so much to relieve the
suffe=
ring of the pig, but to relieve myself from the suffering I experienced
at =
the sight of the pig, I did this only for my own peace of mind!=E2=80=9D Wh=
at
Lincoln said then is the practical truth of the matter.

It is only this=
 self-satisfaction =E2=80=93 one=E2=80=99s own happiness=E2=80=93which is t=
he hidden
motive behind all kinds of selfless acts! This can in no way be d=
enied.
