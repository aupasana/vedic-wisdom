Namaste, friends.

 

I have some questions about some of the procedures of homam.  I went
shopping today and spent probably more than I should have, but I think that
I am nearly ready to start thinking about preparations for possibly doing a
homam.  (I am a little nervous, can you tell?)  Additionally, I found my
image of Shiva and Parvati over the weekend, and was lucky enough to find a
beautiful sivalingam at a wonderful price today.

 

Now, a few questions about some details that one such as I, a total idiot,
might ask:

 

1.        First, I have some dhoop incense.  Wonderful smells, I love it.
It will not stay lit.  Or rather it does stay lit but when I blow it out to
let it smolder and give off the wonderful smells, it goes out after a few
minutes (maximum).  Am I doing something wrong?  I am first forming it into
a cone (pyramid) shape.  Is that incorrect?  Should I be dipping it in oil
or something first?  Should I be putting it onto some sort of hot coal?

 

2.       I have never used camphor before (except maybe in some medicines).
I have never seen camphor used before (that I know of).  I did not even
really know what camphor *was* until I looked it up on the Internet this
morning.  I now have bought some camphor.  The camphor I have is in little
pieces, a bit less than the diameter of an American dime.  Is this too
small?  I am thinking specifically of the instruction to "Take a piece of
camphor, light it from the lamp and place it in the middle of the homa
kundam."  How quickly does the camphor burn?  Is it more of a "light it from
the lamp and then hurry and drop it in the middle of the homa kundam before
you burn your fingers?"

 

3.       Is 'turmeric powder' the same thing as ground turmeric, the spice
used in cooking?

 

4.       When it is said, "In fact, do not eat eggs, meat and seafood on the
day of homam," does that mean prior to or even after if you do it in the
morning?  I am transitioning to pure lacto-vegetarianism, but am not always
as conscientious as I could be.

 

5.       Page 12 says to "If you can, put dhenu mudra [in the tumbler with
the water] (else, don't worry)."  What is dhenu mudra?  I bought something
while out today called "navdana."  It is also called "Mother's Pride T" and
is specifically designated as a puja item for religions purposes only.  Is
appears to be small nuts and beans, sort of.  If this is not it, can you
tell me what is dhenu mudra, and what is this navdana used for please?  I
got a strong feeling that I should buy it for some reason.

 

6.       I bought three dried coconut halves today.  Roughly how many of
these rituals can I expect this supply to last?

 

7.       When the instructions say "You can offer just a raisin or a little
sugar also," how much is "a little?"  A pinch?  A teaspoon?

 

8.       Is there ever a problem, when offering ghee onto an open flame with
a  wooden spoon, of the spoon catching fire?

 

Also, just kind of general questions about a few things:

 

9.       I have a copper bracelet with Sanskrit lettering on it reading "OM
Namah Sivaya."  I have been normally wearing this on my left wrist, since
that is where it feels natural to do so.  Is that where such are normally
worn?

 

10.   OOC, where it says "The rakshaa (holy ash) can be mixed with a drop of
ghee and applied on the forehead as a dot or a line,"
 do I remember correctly that it is traditional for Saivites to use three
horizontal lines on the forehead instead of the single dot?  Or is that a
misunderstanding?  And if that is the case, what is the symbolism there?

 

Thank you for any comments.

 

Sincerely,

 

Davyd

 

 

 

Thank you for any responses.
