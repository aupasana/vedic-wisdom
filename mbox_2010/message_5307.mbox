Foreword

By Dr. Davi=
d Frawley
(Sri Vamadeva Shastri)

The Vedic tradition is primarily one of k=
nowledge, going back to the four Vedas as books of knowledge, the term Veda=
 deriving from the root `vid', meaning to see, to know, to directly experie=
nce, or to realize within one's own awareness. The Vedic tradition is furth=
er defined as Sanatana Dharma or a universal and eternal (Sanatana) traditi=
on of truth and natural law (Dharma). What Veda is seeking to know is the n=
ature of things, ultimately the nature of our own being
that is connected t=
o the Divine presence or higher consciousness which pervades all existence.=


As such, the Vedic tradition is not content merely with belief in God or =
even communion with the deity as its ultimate aim. Its goal is to know the =
deity within our own minds and hearts in the sense of this higher knowledge=
 born of direct perception, not as a mere mental or emotional connection, b=
ut one that engages our entire being to its immortal core.

Such inner know=
ing is not a speculative venture or a matter of salvation through faith. Ve=
dic Dharma teaches specific philosophies or ways of knowledge about the dei=
ty. For these to really work, specific sadhanas or spiritual practices, lar=
gely yogic in nature are required. Vedic Dharma does not rest upon faith at=
 a mass level, but spiritual practices at an individual level for achieving=
 the ultimate goal of life described as moksha, or liberation from the cycl=
e of birth and death.

Other religious, spiritual and philosophical systems=
 in the world also have their concerns with and their means of gaining such=
 inner knowledge of the deity, often put under the banner of the `religious=
 experience' or the `mystical experience'. Such experiences are also common=
ly referred to as `unity consciousness', though they have considerable vari=
eties.

The pursuit of mystical experiences has been a sidelight or rarity =
in western religious traditions, and has sometimes been suppressed by them,=
 particularly when it challenges the authority of existing institutions. Ye=
t it has been widely encouraged in India since the most ancient times. Each=
 follower of a particular spiritual path in India is usually encouraged to =
take up such a sadhana to contact the deity within. At the same time, since=
 there are clearly defined paths to higher realization in the Vedic traditi=
on, there is less danger
of the practitioner falling into the confusion tha=
t mystical experiences can sometimes create for those who stumble upon them=
, rather than are trained to receive them.

Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya (=
Dr. Frank Morales) is a rare western teacher who knows both the philosophie=
s and the practices of the Vedic tradition and has firsthand experience of =
how they really work. He is a highly qualified teacher, or Acharya, of Vedi=
c Dharma, the first western Acharya of a western Hindu temple, not merely a=
n academic looking at Vedic thought with little practical experience of how=
 it is applied. He has also studied in depth other religious,
spiritual and=
 philosophical traditions. This provides him a much deeper level of insight=
 into the Vedic tradition than normally found in the vast majority of teach=
ers today. He takes the discussion out of the mere speculative realm to the=
 domain of spiritual practice, making his discussion relevant to those invo=
lved in meditation and devotional disciplines as well.

Sri Dharma Pravarta=
ka Acharya focuses on the issue of pramanas or proofs, the complex yet cent=
ral issue of epistemology. If we want to know something, the first question=
 that arises is: "What are our available means of legitimate knowledge?" Th=
e issue is particularly important relative to spiritual studies. If somethi=
ng Divine, infinite and eternal does exist, through what special means can =
it be known? Obviously, our ordinary mind and senses are designed to know
l=
imited, finished and transient objects, though they can speculate about som=
ething beyond. Is there some other more direct means that we can develop in=
 order to do this?

In western philosophy the means of knowledge are largel=
y limited to reason and the senses, and what can be extrapolated from them,=
 though theologies regularly bring in faith and scripture as well. The Vedi=
c tradition has also accepted samadhi, or yogic perception born of the medi=
tative mind, as a legitimate means of knowledge. This not only includes the=
 mystical experience, but allows a practical and scientific approach to it =
through yogic disciplines.

The Vedic tradition includes the idea of script=
ure, or shruti, not as books to merely believe in, but as indicators and gu=
idelines to a higher realization that should be employed in the context of =
sadhana, or spiritual practice. The Vedic shruti is linked to the idea of s=
habda, or sacred sound, and mantra, reflecting the Divine Word and cosmic c=
reative vibration. Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya examines the issue of scri=
pture and sacred sound quite clearly from a Vedic perspective.

Most modern=
 Vedantic studies have focused on the Advaita Vedanta of
Shankaracharya and=
 his modern proponents since the time Swami Vivekananda over a century ago.=
 Recently, the Dvaitic and Vishishtadvaitic forms of Vedanta have also rece=
ived attention, which adds another dimension to these studies. Sri Dharma P=
ravartaka Acharya has taken a view that can embrace and honor all these sys=
tems, without losing their specific value and different approaches.

For th=
is examination, he has focused on one primary thinker, the work of Jiva Gos=
wami, an important figure in the Vaishnava tradition about whom much has be=
en written in recent years with the development of the Bhakti Yoga movement=
 throughout the world. Yet he grounds his study of Goswami in a greater ana=
lysis of all six Vedic philosophies as well as their connections with other=
 philosophical and theological traditions East and West. This affords the b=
ook a relevance beyond India to the global issues of spiritual knowledge.

=
Goswami's work, like that of many Vaishnava Hindus, in turn is based on the=
 Bhagavata Purana, which is regarded by many Hindu scholars as the greatest=
 of the Puranas, as well as an important extension of the thought and insig=
ht of the Vedas, Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita. Western scholarship has ofte=
n ignored such texts, focusing on the prime Sutras and texts of the six sys=
tems of Vedic philosophy, as if there was nothing more to be considered. Th=
is has limited their scope and vision in understanding Vedic philosophy, a =
situation that the
author seeks to correct.

The book reflects an academic =
rigor in orientation, approach and expression. It demands profound thought =
on the part of its reader. Yet the book also represents a new type of exper=
iential scholarship from westerners trained in authentic Eastern traditions=
. This provides a different view than what is normally found from academics=
 looking at Eastern traditions from the outside.

Such `inside the traditio=
n' views provide a good alternative and help us frame the focus of a new de=
bate, which is not simply about different philosophies or theologies, but a=
bout the ultimate truth of our own existence and what our true nature as co=
nscious beings really resides in. With "The Vedic Way of Knowing God", and =
his own personal spiritual example, Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya leads us =
forward in this new adventure in consciousness.
