Dear Utpal,
=C2=A0
Thanks for the example. It set me thinking.
=C2=A0
I und=
erstand that it is a better and practical attitude to have detachment.
=C2=
=A0
With the Second Approach, I think, Mr. FL will not Create New Rinas and=
 will be able to break free from this particular chain. He may have success=
fully PAID BACK his debt.

With the first Approach, Mr. FL has identified h=
imself very strongly with Money and its ownership and hence all the actions=
 done due to that, so He may have created NEW RINAS which will be needed to=
 settled on a later date.

Does one person in a two way rna, breaking off, =
result in the rna ending? Now imagine that in your example Mr Fl becomes to=
tally detached to money and looks at it as rna, but that does not change th=
at fact that VS in your example unlawfully did not replay money. 
=C2=A0
No=
w next life Nature decides to set the balance right and give exact amount o=
f money from VS to FL, even though FL is detached and does not want it, but=
 the money still lands in his pocket. VS keep cribbing mentally that he has=
 lost money. From VS's perspective the karma involving MOney, VS and FL is =
far from over, even though FL has become totally detached. Now what happens=
, logically?=C2=A0Even if VS is detached, can=C2=A0he escape from the karmi=
c link? I don't know. =C2=A0It is like I throw a ball=C2=A0straight up in t=
he air. When the ball is in mid air, I get moksha somehow, but will that st=
op the ball from falling on my head? 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0If both parties become d=
etached then Karma is over. But that is not the case here.=C2=A0=C2=A0In re=
al life finding one detached person is so difficult, getting two detached p=
eople is nearly impossible. 
=C2=A0
Confusing but interesting.

Dear Rajarshi,

As you finally said, Karma is ex=
ceedingly complex. I do not know if `Dry Intellect' (The one without a cert=
ain level of Realization) can ever break the code of the karma software.

I=
 would think of responding to our one query filtering it from all those int=
erconnected and too complicated queries.

>And how does one know the fine l=
ine between paying debt and >creating a new one?

Consider this real life e=
xample.

Take a case study - Mr. Fool (FL) Landed some Amount of Money to M=
r. 'Very smart'(VS) on basis of trust and for a pious cause. Now it happene=
d so that Mr. VS could not repay it due to reasons only known to him. Mr. V=
S gives many excuses and many dates but fails and ultimately does not pay b=
ack. Mr. FL is under great pressure due to that.

Mr. FL can have many opti=
ons to react in the situations:

1] Thinking constantly and repenting for t=
he act He can-
Curse, Constantly follow-up, Mount Abuses, Remain under stre=
ss, resort to other techniques of 'Vasuli' and resorts to many Internal and=
 external activities concerning that issue.

In this case, He strongly iden=
tifies with the Money, act of Giving then expecting it back, Repenting etc.=
..

OR

2] Mr. FL can really grab the golden chance to resort to the implem=
entation of knowledge (KIP-Knowledge in Practice) and thinks that it was a =
Rina which needed to be paid back and practically starts training the mind =
with that knowledge. He follows up for the money but with the attitude of d=
etachment. Although he shows to his family and friends that he is extremely=
 concerned and it was foolish act etc... But in his mind he thinks that it =
was a rina from some past life which was fulfilled. He thinks that they wer=
e Money of Mother and she will take care. If they needed to come back, she =
will do it or if they were to be paid to nullify some past rinas then they =
will not come back.

With the Second Approach, I think, Mr. FL will not Cre=
ate New Rinas and will be able to break free from this particular chain. He=
 may have successfully PAID BACK his debt.

With the first Approach, Mr. FL=
 has identified himself very strongly with Money and its ownership and henc=
e all the actions done due to that, so He may have created NEW RINAS which =
will be needed to settled on a later date.

However I am not sure for what =
I have written. I think nobody can be sure.

Best Regards,

Utpal

 is eating Self.<BR>> =C3=82 <BR>> Of course, a vedantin also ha=

 ritual and not be fully absorbed in one's thinking. =

to transcend duality! In the case of a person who chants a Vedic verse that=
 says "I am Self and I am consuming Self" and eats tasty laddus and nicely =
made food, the fallout from failing to absorb the mind in Self while eating=
 is not too bad. If the mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice) taste=
 of a laddu or other food, what is the big deal? On the other hand, if the =
mind fails to
 absorb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it will be =

how to overcome the fascination some minds may have for sex?<BR>> =C3=82=
 <BR>> An aghora will take it to an extreme. He will try to fix the=
 root cause and remove fascination from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhan=
a and sex as two different activities (one pure and the other impure), he m=
ay combine them into one without such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppo=
se an aghora sits naked with his partner sitting naked on his lap and then =
does his japam. In the beginning, this may titillate and result in sex. He =
may think that his sadhana is being made impure. But, suppose he persists t=
o do japam like that for several months/years. Eventually, mind may be repr=
ogrammed. He may no longer feel that he is doing something impure. He
 may =
no longer feel titillation. The association in his mind between nakedness a=
nd sex may be broken down. Seeing naked pictures physically or mentally may=
 no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of meditation. Any sma=
ll thoughts related to sex that suddenly rise in the head may not lead to d=
enser and<BR>> denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in sadhan=
a, but they may now take the mind back to meditation. After spending so muc=
h time in meditation while sitting naked intimately, the attraction and thr=
ill mind may feel for nakedness or intimacy may be broken down. Overall, th=
e person's fascination and weakness for sex may be gone largely.<BR>> =
=C3=82 <BR>> Mind has a lot of conditioning based on prior experien=
ces and the thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break dow=
n some of these structures by engaging in certain practices that undermine =
those structures.<BR>> =C3=82 <BR>> However, is this a
 fool-pro=
of method? Not really. It is also possible that the person keeps on engagin=
