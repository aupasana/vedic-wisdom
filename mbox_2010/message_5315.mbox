Namaskar,

    Immortal and immortalizing Will is the "activating force" ac=
ting as precursor to all activity.

> > (2) Saints/yogis who ascended to th=
e immortal planes with their physical body (e.g. Sant Tukaram who was taken=
 by Vishnu himself to Vaikuntha in his *physical* body to live there foreve=
r!) never talked about such a pursuit.

   Even yuddhisthir went to heaven =
in his physical body, but that is different from divinizing the Physical bo=
dy. Vishnu is one of the many devatas from which Physical consciousness fin=
ds its expression, another being Agni, thus attaining divinity in body requ=
ires worshipping more than one devata simultaneously.

> Striving for physi=
cal immortality as a great ideal can create such an unhealthy fascination t=
hat is not idealized in any scriptures.
    
    The divinizing of Physical=
 body by Mahavatar Babaji is a scripture in itself, and since such a thing =
is not being idealized by any scripture, it only means that: "Scriptures ot=
her than Vedas contain partial truth". 
    They talk about the highest tru=
th, but only Vedic method, of worshipping divinity in its numerous forms, i=
s the most complete expression of truth for all the creatures in all the pl=
anes of existence. Such a worship would finally lead to divinization of Phy=
sical body.

> > (1) As I said, Yoga Vaasishtham and other scriptures tell =
you to unidentify with the body to realize higher realities. They do talk a=
bout higher states beyond samdhi, but never tell you to think of the physic=
al body as you attempt to realize.

    Vedic method, worshipping the devat=
as, allows for immortality, through Soma devata.

> > (3) The ones in scrip=
tures who actively pursued the divinization/immortalization of physical bod=
y did not succeed. For example, king Trishanku wanted to ascend to the immo=
rtal plane in his physical body. His family guru Maharshi Vasishtha refused=
 to help him. Maharshi Vishwamitra tried to help, but did not succeed!

   =
  OTOH, if one doesn't perform the yagna correctly, Indra doesn't allow the=
 ascent of mind, what to say of the body.

> All scriptures, whether it is =
Upanishads or Yoga Vaasishtham, say that you overcome your self-identificat=
ion with the perishable body and identify with that which cannot be destroy=
ed. Then you are liberated.

   Divinizing the Physical body itself will re=
move the sense of self-identification, Ahamkara, in any limited sense bound=
 to a Physical body of ones' own possession or of the loved ones. No one ca=
n attain liberation in Physical body, unless one divinizes it - Kriya and J=
nana are not a substitute to Iccha shakti.

regards,
Aryama

se of shakti against avatar, binding the physical body of both Ram and Laks=
hman, by a mortal (Meghnaad) was a great deed, because even the motherly lo=
ve of Yashoda couldn't bind Krishna avatar by a rope. Meghnaad was son of R=
avana. If it were not for Hanumaan, and Garuda using divine powers, the res=
ult would have been different.
