Dear Narsimhaji,

Read through the Ganapathi Homam manual and it seems to b=
e little difficult for me to do the whole process without errors.

I have p=
layed the video done by you several times and I enjoy listening to it.

Can=
't I just listen to the video of homam manual and just try to meditate=A0 o=
n lord Ganesha and just do simple steps like offering food, dhoop, camphor =
etc.

Can't I offer grains ( as mentioned in homam manual, each time we say=
 "Swaha" ) at lotus feet of Ganesha instead of=A0 fire.

Obviously I am ask=
ing these questions because I need some help ( materialistic along with spi=
ritual goal).

Please guide me.

Best Regards,

Sunita
