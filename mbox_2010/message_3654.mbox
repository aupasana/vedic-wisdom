Dear Sri Narasimharao garu, 

I am very much in awe after I learnt that you=
 do chandi homam everyday. You also wrote that it takes about 1.25 hours to=
 1.5 hours to do your chandi homam. How can you accomplish that feat with 7=
00 ahutis in such a short time? Also, in my case, I do sandhyavandanam with=
 108 Gayatri (20 minutes)+ganapathi mantra japam 108 times(10 minutes), a s=
hort rudra Abhishekam with pachakshari, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 minutes) =
totalling to about 35 - 40 minutes daily ritual. Plus I sometimes do specia=
l rituals several times a week, that takes about 1 to 1.5 hours in all. How=
 to integrate these along with homam? Is Sri vidyopasana different from Cha=
ndi homam? Could you please explain what is sri Vidya and how it is to be l=
earnt? I am very motivated to learn what the Devi Mahatmayam is all about b=
ut I also have keen interest in Sri Vidya, because I am a musician also and=
 learnt all the nava-avarna krithis of Great Muththuswami Dikshitar recentl=
y.
