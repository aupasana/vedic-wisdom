 REFACE

MEN court happiness and shun misery. It is the same with other bei=
ngs also.
This holds good for the common run of mankind. But the higher ord=
er is bent
upon right conduct, enduring patiently the good or evil that it =
may bring.
Fellowship with these will be lasting, whereas fellowship with o=
rdinary
people will not be. Good will result to the world through fellowshi=
p with
the higher order only.

The question then arises: "What is right?'' =
The point is important, but the
answer has not been found. Why? Because wha=
t is right is determined by
circumstances. However comprehensive a work may=
 be written on the subject,
there will always be circumstances not envisage=
d by the author. Therefore it
becomes necessary to realize that state which=
 will enable us to assess the
various conditions and determine what is righ=
t.

That state is one only. There are no states like it. Although it is sin=
gle,
it is extraordinary that the worldly wise consider it exceedingly rare=
.
Nothing can be more extraordinary than this. That unique state is very
cl=
early taught in the Upanishads. In this book I have put down the same
truth=
 according to my understanding. I have considered it my duty. I do not
clai=
m originality. The six chapters of this book are so closely interrelated
th=
at some point which may be expected in one chapter may be found in
another.=
 Again a few points which may not be clear on a superficial reading
will be=
come clear upon closer study. More may be gathered from major works
or Sage=
s. Universal Mother, Master true, save us!

- The Author

The Text

Chapter=
 I - UNITY

1. All including the world seen by you and yourself, the seer o=
f the world,
is one only.

2. All that you consider as I, you, he, she and =
it, is one only.

3. What you consider to be sentient beings and what you c=
onsider to be
insentient, such as earth, air, fire and water is all one.

4=
. The good which is derived by your considering all as one cannot be had by=

considering each as separate from the other. Therefore all is one.

5. The=
 knowledge of the unity of all, is good for you and good for others as
well=
. Therefore all is one.

6. He who sees "I am separate," "you are separate,=
" "he is separate" and so
on, acts one way to himself and another way to ot=
hers. He cannot help doing
so. The thought "I am separate, others are separ=
ate" is the seed from which
grows the tree of differing actions in relation=
 to different persons. How
can there be any lapse from righteousness for a =
person who knows the unity
of himself with others? As long as the germ of d=
ifferentiation is there, the
tree of differing actions will flourish, even =
unawares. Therefore give up
differentiation. All is one only.

7. Ask: "If =
in the world all things appear different, how can I consider all
as one? Is=
 there any way of gaining this knowledge?" The reply is: "In the
same tree =
we see leaves, flowers, berries and branches, different from one
another, y=
et they are all one because they are all included in the word
'tree'. Their=
 root is the same; their sap is the same. Similarly, all
things, all bodies=
, all organisms are from the same source and activated by
a single life pri=
nciple." Therefore all is one.

8. 0h good man! Is the statement that "All =
is one," good or evil? Think for
yourself. Just as the person will always b=
e righteous who regards himself
like others and others like himself, how ca=
n any evil attach itself to him
who knows himself to be others and the othe=
rs to be himself? Tell me if
there is any better way for obtaining good tha=
n the knowledge of unity?
Certainly other methods cannot be as good as this=
 one. How can anyone love
others more than when knowing them to be himself,=
 to know them in unity-love
as unity, for they are truly one.

9. Who can s=
hare the mental peace and freshness of the knower of unity? He
has no cares=
. The Good of all is his own good. A mother considers her
children's well-b=
eing to be her own well-being. Still, her love is not
perfect because she t=
hinks she is separate and her children are separate.
The love of a Sage, wh=
o has realized the unity of all, far excels even the
love of a mother. Ther=
e is no other means of gaining such love than the
knowledge of unity. There=
fore all is one.

10. Know that the world as a whole is your undecaying bod=
y and that you are
the everlasting life of the whole world. Tell me if ther=
e is any harm in
doing so? Who fears to go the harmless way? Be courageous.=
 The Vedas teach
this very truth. There is nothing but yourself. All good w=
ill be yours. Yea,
you become the good itself. All that others gain from yo=
u will be good only.
Who will work evil to his own body and soul? A remedy =
is applied if there is
an abscess in the body. Even if the remedy is painfu=
l, it is meant to do
good only. Such will be some of your actions; they wil=
l also be for the good
of the world. For that reason, you will not be invol=
ved in differentiation.
I put it briefly: The knower of unity will act as o=
ne should. In fact, the
knowledge of unity makes him act. He cannot err. In=
 the world, he is God
made visible. All is one.


Here is Chapter II from E=
llam Ondre:

You

1. Who are you? Are you this body? If so, why are you not=
 aware of a serpent
crawling on it when you are in deep sleep? So then can =
you be this body? No,
certainly not. You must be other than this body.

2. =
Sometimes in sleep you dream. There you identify yourself with someone.
Can=
 you be that one? You cannot be. Otherwise, what becomes of that
individual=
 on your waking? You are not he. Furthermore, you are ashamed of
having ide=
ntified yourself with him. Clearly, you are not that particular
person. You=
 are the one that stands apart from him.

3. Recall the state of dreamless =
slumber. What is your state then? Can that
be your true nature? Surely you =
will not subscribe to this belief. Why?
Because you are not so foolish as t=
o identify yourself with the massive
darkness which obstructs you from know=
ing the state you are in. Discerned by
the intellect from the things around=
, how can you admit yourself to be the
same as ignorance or blank? Or, how =
can it truly be your real nature? It
cannot be. You are the knower who know=
s that this state remains one of dense
darkness veiling your true nature. H=
ow can you be that which you have
experienced and condemned? Therefore you =
are not the dark ignorance of deep
sleep. You stand apart from this too.

4=
. When it is said that even this gross body is not you, can you be any
othe=
r thing which is yet farther away from you? In the same way that you are
no=
t this gross body, you are not anything farther from the body, nor the
drea=
m person, nor the ignorance of deep sleep. You are distinct from these
thre=
e states and this world.

5. These three states can be reduced to two condi=
tions only-namely, the one
of the subject and object, and the other is the =
unawareness of the subject
itself. The former includes the waking and dream=
 states, whereas the latter
represents deep slumber. All your experiences a=
re comprised in these two
conditions only. Both of them are foreign to you.=
 Your true nature remains
distinct from them.

6. If you ask what that is, =
it is called turiya, which means the fourth
state. Why is this name used? T=
his name is proper because it seems to say
the three states of your experie=
nce-waking, dream and deep sleep-are foreign
to you and your true state is =
the fourth, which is different from these
three. Should the three states, w=
aking, dream and deep sleep, be taken to
form one long dream, the fourth st=
ate represents the waking from this dream.
Thus it is more withdrawn than d=
eep sleep, also more wakeful than the waking
state. Therefore your true sta=
te is that fourth one which is distinguished
from the waking, dream and dee=
p sleep states. You are that only. What is
this fourth state? It is knowled=
ge which does not particularize anything. It
is not unaware of itself. That=
 is to say, the fourth state is Pure Knowledge
which is not conscious of an=
y object, but not unconscious itself. Only he
who has realized it even for =
a trice, has realized the Truth. You are that
only.

8. What is there more =
for him who has gained the fourth state? Practically,
it is not possible fo=
r anyone to remain forever in that state, that is, the
state of no particul=
ar knowledge. He who has realized the fourth state later
wakes up in this w=
orld, but for him this world is not as before. He sees
that what he realize=
d as the fourth state, shines forth as all this. He will
not imagine this w=
orld as distinct from that Pure Knowledge. Thus what he
saw within, he now =
sees without in a different form. In the place of the
differentiation of ol=
d, he is now established in the state of
non-differentiation everywhere. No=
w, he is all. There is nothing distinct
from himself. His eyes closed or op=
en, howsoever the things may change, his
state remains unchanged. This is t=
he state of Brahman. This is the natural
eternal state. You are that ever-t=
rue state.

9. There is nothing beyond this state. The words, 'inward' and =
'outward'
have no meaning for him. All is one. His body, speech and mind ca=
nnot
function selfishly. Their workings will be grace for the good of all. =
The
fragmentary "I" is lost forever. His ego can never revive. Therefore he=
 is
said to be liberated here and now. He does not live because his body li=
ves,
nor does he die because his body dies. He is eternal. There is nothing=
 other
than he. You are He.

10. Who is God? He is grace. What is Grace? Aw=
areness without the
fragmentary ego. How can one know that there is such a =
state? Only if one
realizes it. The Vedas laud such a one as having realize=
d God and become one
with Him. Therefore the greatest good that one can der=
ive from the world and
the greatest good which one can render unto it, is t=
o realize this state. In
fact, there are no states besides this. They appea=
r in the state of
ignorance. For him who knows, there is one state only. Yo=
u are that.
