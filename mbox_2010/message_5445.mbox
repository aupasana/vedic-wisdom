Namaste,

Personal attacks in a=C2=A0serious=C2=A0discussions are the hall =

inferior mind which lacks in depth and knowledge=
 and confidence (and sometimes 
it can be a=C2=A0reflection of a stunted un=

In a trivial discussion,=C2=A0w=

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Gentle vs fierce attitudes (Re: On Physical Immor=
tality)

=C2=A0 
Namaste Vinay ji,

I agree that pretended sweetness is use=
ful sometimes. In fact, it can generate 
real sweetness through resonance o=
ver time. I did not mean to justify personal 
attacks, nor was I writing ab=
out a specific case at all. I was writing in 
general about gentle attitude=
 vs aggressive attitude in the context of dharma. 
Yes, intellectual opposi=
tion can be expressed firmly and yet impersonally. 
Personal attacks are us=
ually bad and purposeless. They can be dharmik only when 
a very adharmik p=
erson needs to be torn down to pieces as he is spreading 
adharma in the wo=
rld.

Narasimha was ferocious because he had to kill Hiranyakashipu, who de=
sired 
physical immortality and invincibility and nearly got it. In the abs=
ence of 
Hiranyakashipu, that ferociousness is not need. 


Best regards,
N=
arasimha
