Namaskarams Narasimhaji,
Hope you are doing good!! As guided by you and Raj=
arshi I started reciting the Chandi Path every day (a few chapters at first=
, then end to end recently) and by the blessings of the mother I am now abl=
e to complete the entire recitation within 2 hours. I am planning to start =
doing Chandi Homam regularly(at least once a month) starting this Sunday, m=
other willing. I pray to the mother and Request your well wishes along with=
 all the other Chandi sadhakas in this group to help me in successfully com=
plete this great task.

Coming to the Chandi Homam Manual I had the followi=
ng queries:-
1) In the poornahuti Section here, it seems to be a shortened =
one compared to the Ganapathi Homam. Is there any specific reason why we ha=
ve left out the "poornamidhah purnamidham ---purnamevavahshistye" mantra ?
=
Also shoudnt we add the navarna mantra and add "poornahutim samarpayami" li=
ke in Ganapathi Homam?

2) Also there is no Tarpanam mentioned in the Chand=
i Homam. Any reason why so?

Eagerly waiting for your replies.

Thanks and =
Regards,
Girish Sundaram
