Namaste,
 
I am forwarding Manish's comments on Vijay's mail.
 
In addition, I want to respond to Vijay's points 3 and 4.
 
*        *        *
 
3. The word energy or shakti may sound heavy and may have all kinds of connotations in the minds of people. Shakti is simply a force that can be used to change or move something karmically.
 
Suppose you see something or someone beautiful and the enemy of "desire" (one of shadripus - six internal enemies) tries to attack your mind. Or suppose someone abuses you and the enemy of "anger" tries to attack your mind. How does your mind fight back?
 
Just as you need energy to fight external enemies, your mind needs energy to fight internal enemies. If your mind has no shakti, the enemies take over and take mind in a direction. If you mind has and exerts shakti, the enemies are stopped (fully or partially) and the their push on the mind is negated.
 
When you eat, you get physical energy. When you exercise, that physical energy is stored in the right places of the body. Similarly, when your mind spends time in a state of focused calmness, it eats from the universal source of shakti and gets nourished. When it spends time in patterns of regulated exercises (e.g. homam, japam, bhajan, satsang etc), it stores that shakti in the right places in the mind.
 
Just as physical energy helps you fight external enemies who attack you, this spiritual energy helps you fight internal enemies who attack you.
 
If your surrender is perfect and you are going through the good and bad fruits of your karmas without committing new karmas, your point is right. You are like a weightless leaf and you need no energy - you go with the flow. But, if you still have a conditioned mind that is vulnerable to attacks from shadripus and vulnerable to committing NEW karmas, don't you think some energy is needed?
 
Don't look at spiritual shakti as something that enables you to do great deeds in the world. Though that too is possible, that is a ego-promiting attitude and inappropriate for most sadhakas. Looks at spiritual shakti as something that enables you to fight back your own internal enemies and overcome your own weaknesses.
 
*        *        *
 
4. If you are living every second without any goals/agendas/wishes/anticipations at all, then you are all already liberated and then your point is meaningful.
 
But, if you do have some some goals, some wishes, some anticipations, some agendas etc, then you should realize that those wishes and anticipations have a kinetic energy of their own (kaarmically) and they bind you further. You need the spiritual energy (shakti) accumulated through exertion of self-control to negate that kinetic energy and stop you from getting bound further.
 
Some people make the mistake of thinking that desire of moksha is also a desire and can stop you from moksha. That is true. However, it is better than many other desires and definitely worth having. It can be jettisoned when the time comes.
 
Suppose you have a trash can in which you collect trash. Just throw away the collected trash and hang on to the trash can. If you throw away the can too, then new trash that comes in will be all over the floor. So keep the can so that you keep collecting trash and throwing it away. You can throw away the trash can also, when you are absolutely sure that no trash is being generated.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
