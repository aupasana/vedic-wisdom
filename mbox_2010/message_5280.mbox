Namaste,

In the earlier message it is said:

Physical form, in accordance with >highest ideal of Aurobindo, like the Mah=
aavatar babaji has done, >because its basis is Sat-Chid-Ananada.

Narasimha=
 Garu has mentioned:
> Aurobindo's ideals have been misunderstood by many l=
earned people >to mean that he was striving for physical immortality.

I ha=
ve hardly read writings by Aurobindo and I am not properly aware of his hig=
hest ideal which is called as Supra-consciousness but when I saw that Mahaa=
vatar Babaji was stated as an example for that Ideal i started thinking abo=
ut this.

While into a particular Sadhana, a certain chain of thoughts appe=
ared one after another in my consciousness. I try to Penn down as below:

1=
) In "Autobiography of A Yogi", if i remember correctly, Its mentioned that=
 once Mahaavatar Babaji wished to dissolve the body i.e. physical form but =
he was advised not to do so by his divine Sister and then Babaji said that =
Its a *DIVINE WISH* which has come out from the sister and so he would stay=
 till the end of this yuga.

2) Vimalananda has categorically emphasized th=
at the Final Boss is a certain Senior Rishi who is in the centre of Rishi M=
andala and he controls the Adhya Shakti and hence control the complete crea=
tion

3) Ramakrishna used to tell one story to his gatherings - Once Krishn=
a took Arjuna in some other realm to show him some wonder. Both came at som=
e place where Arujan saw a gigantic tree and countless fruits hangning on t=
he tree. Krishna asked Arjuna to just take a closer look at it and he was a=
stonished to see the fruits were actually as many Krishnas. Krishna then to=
ld Arjuna that this is tree called Brahma in which produces many Krishna.

=
The above 3 were the exact thoughts came one after the other in my mind. I =
was trying to synthesize and derive the essence of all these thoughts. Only=
 one common thing i could gather is that, there is ONE POWER HOUSE - The so=
urce of all which is recognized by very very High divine beings like Shri K=
rishna, Ramakrishna, Mahaavtar Babaji, Vimalananda and such many others. Vi=
shnu, Brahma and Shiva and all the other we think of including ourselves ar=
e from that source. The whole creation including all universes known and un=
known along with their Gods are from that single source. 

I do not know if=
 my message was relevant to the topic but some how I thought that way. Supr=
a-conscious ness probably is one more stage in the hierarchy wherein your d=
ivinity is raised to such highest level wherein the Power house called Brah=
man provides you with option of retaining a *divine physical body* as long =
as one desires or probably as per Brahman's desire while at the same time r=
etaining the Brahman consciousness. I have actually come round to Narasimha=
's view and probably that seems to be the highest state which we one can lo=
ok up to, which is probably Supra-consciousness of Aurobindo and which was =
achieved by Krishna, Mahaavatar Babaji and such others. 

Best Regards,

Ut=

 Any lower shakti is an ability to perform actions with objects in the fiel=
d of duality. Why does one perform actions and manipulate the objects in th=
e field of duality? Because one is pursuing happiness of some kind or the o=
ther. But the happiness one gets when one achieves something in the field o=
f duality is not permanent.

Yogi", if i remember correctly, Its mentioned that once Mahaavatar Babaji w=
ished to dissolve the body i.e. physical form but he was
 advised not to do=
 so by his divine Sister and then Babaji said that Its a *DIVINE WISH* whic=

ga.<BR><BR>2) Vimalananda has categorically emphasized that the Final Boss =
is a certain Senior Rishi who is in the centre of Rishi Mandala and he cont=
rols the Adhya Shakti and hence control the complete creation<BR><BR>3) Ram=
akrishna used to tell one story to his gatherings - Once Krishna took Arjun=
a in some other realm to show him some wonder. Both came at some place wher=
e Arujan saw a gigantic tree and countless fruits hangning on the tree. Kri=
shna asked Arjuna to just take a closer look at it and he was astonished to=
 see the fruits were actually as many Krishnas. Krishna then told Arjuna th=
at this is tree called Brahma in which produces many Krishna.<BR><BR>The ab=
ove 3 were the exact thoughts came one after the other in my mind. I was tr=
ying to synthesize and derive the essence of all
 these thoughts. Only one =
common thing i could gather is that, there is ONE POWER HOUSE - The source =
of all which is recognized by very very High divine beings like Shri Krishn=
a, Ramakrishna, Mahaavtar Babaji, Vimalananda and such many others. Vishnu,=
 Brahma and Shiva and all the other we think of including ourselves are fro=
m that source. The whole creation including all universes known and unknown=
 along with their Gods are from that single source. <BR><BR>I do not know i=
f my message was relevant to the topic but some how I thought that way. Sup=
ra-conscious ness probably is one more stage in the hierarchy wherein your =
divinity is raised to such highest level wherein the Power house called Bra=
hman provides you with option of retaining a *divine physical body* as long=
 as one desires or probably as per Brahman's desire while at the same time =
retaining the Brahman consciousness. I have actually come round to Narasimh=
a's view and probably that seems to be the
 highest state which we one can =
look up to, which is probably Supra-consciousness of Aurobindo and which wa=
s achieved by Krishna, Mahaavatar Babaji and such others. <BR><BR>Best Rega=

s have been misunderstood by many learned people to mean that he was strivi=

 immortality. He sadly ended up attracting some wrong peopl=
e that way.<BR>> <BR>> It is possible to remove the distinction betwe=
en manifested things and Brahman and view them as non-different. But that s=
tate is not attainable by even great yogis. Moreover, that state is not ach=

or any sadhaka is to ignore the physical form, overcome the fascination for=
 it and its needs, realize the underlying Self and live as a jeevanmukta li=

ahavatar Babaji has done, divine will will then make one to do so. But, one=
 consciously pursuing it is likely to retain fascination for the physical f=
