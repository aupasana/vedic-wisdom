Namaste Hari ji,

[[[Instead of blowing air can i fan (manually, using a ca=
rdboard  >or using a table fan etc]]]

If camphor is not sufficient then IM=
HO, the way you asked above is quite astute however as you are already doin=
g i.e. using Camphor pieces to bring back the hidden fire is definately a b=
etter way.

[[[In this case should i say any praayashchitta mantra or the m=
antra used for agnipratissthApana initially (OM bhuurbhuvassuvarom).]]]

I =
am not aware of any specific Mantra in such situation. during very early da=
ys, fire was putoff, a couple of times during Homam and i simply re-ignited=
 it with camphor pieces and just prayed in my mind for forgiveness in my mo=
ther tongue. Its very easy and satisfactory. if i do not know a specific ve=
rse for a typical situation, i use my Mother tongue to communicate.

I am s=
ure, Narasimha or any other knowlegable member would give the proper verse =
for such situation.

My second thought is that tgough Fire Seem to be put o=
ff during Homam, but actually it is not and always present there in the for=
m of spark so i would like to think that it may not be even necessary to re=
cite any verse.

Best Regards,

Utpal

The key is that air blown from mouth should touch some surface (e.g. inside=
 wall of bamboo tube) at an angle slightly less than 180 deg, get reflected=
 and then go towards fire. Then, air touching fire will not have saliva in =
it. You can experiment by blowing air onto one palm by reflecting it off th=

 After the nature's call, it is a good idea to take bath again. Some level =
of physical cleanliness is to be maintained with external fire. One cannot =
say "I am pure inside and why does external purity matter". Just as the int=
ernal fire is affected by internal purity, external fire is affected by ext=
ernal purity.

 must be obeyed. If a yogi with a very strong internal fire is doing homam,=
 then actually the internal fire may dominate and the external fire may fol=
low it and resonate with it! Then the rules of external fire do not apply.
