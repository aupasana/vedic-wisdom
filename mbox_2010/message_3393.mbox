Namaste Narasimha Garu!

Thank you for this message. You have come very cl=
ose to resolving my
theoretical doubts as far as Realization and Samadhi is=
 concerned.

I request to answer a few more questions on your explanations.=


***
You have mentioned the 3rd type of realization and stated - "This is =
an
open-ended process." That statement is enough and for me, there is
nothi=
ng to understand further in this type of *Open Loop* realization. I
am sati=
sfied with the understanding that such rarest beings are the one
who may la=
st till the end of creation cycle. If i may give examples such
as Babaji, R=
amakrishna, various Rishis, Gods such as Krishna and such
beings...
***
my =
question is related to 1st and 2nd type of realization.

You have mentioned=
 in Dualistic type realization (which Mira bai had
known to attain) - ": On=
e can experience closeness to deities, oneness
to deities"

In the Non-dual=
istic realization, you mentioned - "> When one goes to
Nirvikalpa Samadhi, =
one may either come back and deal with duality again
or merge in it forever=
"

I wish to understand one thing here. "Oneness to deities" in Dualistic
a=
nd "merging in to Brahman forever" in Non-Dualistic (Adwaitic) are same
in =
nature? i mean, When a bhakta merges in to  a deity completely
without any =
trace (For example, Mira Bai was believed to have merged in
Krishna idol) a=
nd a Yogi merges forever in Brahman in Nirvikalpa Samadhi
- both have attai=
ned the same end?

One more query within the above. When a Bhakta (Dwaitic =
saadhana) merges
in to a Deity, does he/she still needs to attain Nirvikalp=
a Samadhi or
is it a final end for the person? Why i ask this is because Ra=
makrishna
used to frequently tell his disciples that Merging in Brahman is =
the
last thing. Most probably he was referring to the forever merging of
Sa=
dhaka in Nirvikalpa Samadhi but it's my feeling that he was not
considering=
 as 'Final thing' for Dualistic Oneness with a Deity.

I hope you understoo=
d what i am asking here.

Best Regards,

Utpal

This is what one pursues if one has to deal with duality after merging
in=
 non-dual Self. This is an open-ended process. Non-duality is the
simple un=
derlying Truth in all, but its challenge is that it is
imperceptible and re=
ached by subduing I-ness and perception. Duality is
perceptible, but its ch=
allenge is that it has infinite variety and is
pursued through an I-ness an=
d its perception. Keeping an I-ness alive
and realizing the oneness of the =
two is an infinite process with no
single event signaling a "perfect" reali=
zation. Rishis and deities are
pursuing it constantly.

Her=
e it is common to witness both savikalpa and nirvikalpa types.
Samadhi is a=
 certain state of equanimity where the intellect goes beyond
its normal fun=
ction of discrimination. This, in turn, loosens one from
his physical body.=
 In samadhi states, one becomes loose inside the body
or there is a space b=
etween what is you and your body. These samadhis,
by themselves have no gre=
at significance in terms of Realization.
Experiencing a certain type of sam=
adhi, does not mean you are released
from Existence. It is just a new level=
 of experience.
> > >

vel of
experience. The same things that you have experienced at a particula=
r
point in your life, after a few years, you experience them in a totally
d=
ifferent way. So, you have moved from one level of experience to
another le=
vel of experience.

 Samadhi definitely has its benefits. There are many things it has
to offer=
 for an individual, but this doesn't really take you closer to
Realization,=
 as such. Compared to a man who is sober, a man who is
slightly drunk, has =
a different level of experience, but he has to come
down at some point. All=
 samadhis, I would say, are a way of getting high
without any external chem=
icals. Now, by going into these states, it
opens up a new dimension for you=
, but it doesn't leave any great
transformation behind. It doesn't leave yo=
u permanently transformed.

When you go into another reality and stay there for lon=
g hours or long
years, the grip of this reality is broken on you. Now, you =
have come to
an experiential understanding that, this is not it. Not just a=
n
intellectual understanding, you have seen experientially that this is
not=
 it. That is the whole purpose of long meditations. But most realized
being=
s never went into samadhi states.

s in one place. Many of his
disciples, many Buddhist monks went into very l=
ong meditations. They
never came out for years, but Gautama himself never w=

it". This is not going to take you any cl=

moving into a higher level of experience an=
d probably you will get more
caught up, because it is more beautiful than t=
he current reality.
> > >

your life, then every thing else which doesn't take=

is meaningless. Let's say you are climbing the Mount E=

not take one step sideways, because every ounce of energy =
is needed.
Now, if you have to transcend your own consciousness, you need e=
very
ounce of what you have and it's not enough. So, any action that we
per=
form, we don't want it to be a sidewinder.

nirvikalpa, we always keep them in protect=

are maintained for certain periods to establish the dist=

<P><SPAN style=3D"FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAMILY: Georgia;">Namaste Narasimha =
Garu!<o></o></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style=3D"FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAMILY: Geor=
gia;">Thank you for this message. You have come very close to resolving my =
theoretical doubts as far as Realization and Samadhi is concerned.<o></o></=
SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style=3D"FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAMILY: Georgia;">I reques=
t to answer a few more questions on your explanations.<o></o></SPAN></P>
<P=
><SPAN style=3D"FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAMILY: Georgia;">***<BR>You have ment=
ioned the 3rd type of realization and stated - "This is an open-ended proce=
ss." That statement is enough and for me, there is nothing to understand fu=
rther in this type of *Open Loop* realization. I am satisfied with the unde=
rstanding that such rarest beings are the one who may last till the end of =
creation cycle. If i may give examples such as Babaji, Ramakrishna, various=
 Rishis, Gods such as <st1>Krishna</st1> and such beings...<BR>***<BR>my qu=
estion is related to 1st and 2nd type of realization.<o></o></SPAN></P>
<P>=
<SPAN style=3D"FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAMILY: Georgia;">You have mentioned in=
 Dualistic type realization (which Mira bai had known to attain) - ": One c=
an experience closeness to deities, <STRONG><SPAN style=3D"FONT-FAMILY: Geo=
rgia;">oneness to deities</SPAN></STRONG>"<o></o></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style=
=3D"FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAMILY: Georgia;">In the Non-dualistic realization=
, you mentioned - "> When one goes to Nirvikalpa Samadhi, one =
may either come back and deal with duality again or <STRONG><SPAN style=3D"=
FONT-FAMILY: Georgia;">merge in it forever</SPAN></STRONG>"<o></o></SPAN></=
P>
<P><SPAN style=3D"FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAMILY: Georgia;">I wish to under=
stand one thing here. "Oneness to deities" in Dualistic and "merging i=
n to Brahman forever" in Non-Dualistic (Adwaitic) are same in nature? =
i mean, When a bhakta merges in to  a deity completely without any tra=
ce (For example, Mira Bai was believed to have merged in Krishna =
idol) and a Yogi merges forever in Brahman in Nirvikalpa Samadhi =
- both have attained the same end?<o></o></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style=3D=
"FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAMILY: Georgia;">One more query within the abov=
e. When a Bhakta (Dwaitic saadhana) merges in to a Deity, does he/she still=
 needs to attain Nirvikalpa Samadhi or is it a final end for the person? Wh=
y i ask this is because Ramakrishna used to frequently tell his disciples t=
hat Merging in Brahman is the last thing. Most probably he was referring to=
 the forever merging of Sadhaka in Nirvikalpa Samadhi but it's my feeling t=
hat he was not considering as 'Final thing' for Dualistic Oneness with a De=
ity.<o></o></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style=3D"FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAMILY: Georg=

challenge is that it has infinite variety and is pursued through an I-ness =
