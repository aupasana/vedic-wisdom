Namaste Bhatla Ji,

Thank you very much for sharing this information. I hav=
e also read the Aghora 
series of books and know someone mention that this =
book has information in coded 
form (or in between the lines as you put it)=
. Unfortunately, I guess I am a dumb 
guy becuase other than inspiratioon, =
I have not found anything beyond that. I am 
making a second reading of the=
 same book, but would be very much interested in 
buying this book if it is=
 going to make things easier for me to understand. If I 
am able to procure=
 this book online, I will share the information.

In the meantime, is it po=
ssible for someone to help me understand what is in 
between the lines in A=
ghora books?

Thanks,
Bhupendra.
