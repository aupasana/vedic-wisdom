Dear Narasimha,
=C2=A0
I have two queries.
=C2=A0
1) Why is only the Gayatr=
i mantra transmitted during an upanayanam ceremony? I mean, different peopl=
e can have rnas with different divine beings/deities etc, and only a sad-gu=
ru can surely know which deity would be the most suited for an individual's=
 spiritual progress. Like Ramakrishna Paramhamsa was a Brahman by birth=C2=
=A0but he did sadhana of Ma Kaali.=C2=A0Worshipping Mahaganapati can remove=
 obstacles from a person's path. Therefore, instead of the Gayatri mantra w=
hy cannot one=C2=A0initate=C2=A0the child in worshipping Mahaganapati mula =
mantra, which is apt for anyone to chant?=C2=A0=C2=A0This is merely a produ=
ct of tradition or is there some solid spiritual basis for this. (only Gaya=
tri mantra trasmission).
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
2) When a family member expires, we =
maintain a period of 13 days of various rituals etc and during that period =
no worship is generally allowed inside the household (possibly as a mark of=
 mourning). Is there any harm if a person does carry on with his regular wo=
rship/puja/japa/homa during this period of mourning? 
=C2=A0
-Regards

Namaste,

Priests offer sami=
dhas (twigs) symbolizing different samskaras. There is nothing wrong in off=
ering dry coconut pieces instead.

The most important part of upanayanam is=
 the brahmopadesa, i.e. teaching of the Gayatri mantra. All other things ar=
e secondary. For example, many priests re-enact all the rituals that were s=
upposed to be done since birth (e.g. naming, first feeding, first shaving e=
tc), just in case those samskaras were skipped earlier. One can wonder if t=
hat is really necessary and whether it has any real impact on one's spiritu=
al evolution.

There is also a lot of fake drama enacted. The young person =
and his father repeat things in Sanskrit that are told by the priest. Those=
 who know Sanskrit will see that the young man says he is going to go to Ka=
shi and learn Veda etc. He says he will live by begging alms from now on. H=
e even practices it by asking all attendees for alms. There is a lot of ent=
ertaining drama. Of course, most boys getting upanayanam do not really inte=
nd to leave parents, go to Kashi to learn Veda and do not really plan to li=
ve by begging! A lot of things they say are simply lies, done just for fun =
and to enact a drama based on how things could have been in old days!

* * =
*

Put bluntly, being given a mantra by a guru is essentially a spiritual e=
vent and not a social event or a party, though upanayanam has transformed f=
rom a spiritual event into a social event. All you really need is the young=
 man and his guru sitting in one place and the mantra being taught. You don=
't need a big crowd.

Of course, one may say that a big crowd is needed to =
come and give blessings, but "blessings" are a misunderstood and overrated =
concept. For someone to give you blessings that do some good to you, the pe=
rson should have something in his karmik account and the ability to transfe=
r it to you. Most of the times, blessings given by people in our society ar=
e a mere formality and mean nothing, like checks that have "void - this is =
not a real check" printed on them.

Instead of hundred people with various =
levels of interest in the goings on visiting the function out of social com=
pulsion and watching possibly with boredom, an ideal setup for an upanayana=
m is just the sishya and guru and some sadhakas related to them who have do=
ne sadhana and wish the young man well.

* * *

If you ask me, the most imp=
ortant thing is this. The person who is transmitting the Gayatri mantra (us=
ually father) should intensify his spiritual sadhana, especially with Gayat=
ri mantra, in the months before upanayanam. If possible, keep brahmacharya =
for a few months and chant Gayatri mantra for an hour or two everyday. Duri=
ng that time, he should never say Gayatri mantra out loud.

When he transmi=
ts the mantra, he should ensure that only the young man hears it and nobody=
 else does (i.e. no dilution in the transmitted energy). The custom is to s=
ay it in the ear while a cloth covers both, but that only *symbolizes* secr=
etiveness and may not really *ensure* secretiveness. If everybody (especial=
ly the priest) is sitting close to them, they may also hear it in spite of =
a the cloth covering them.

When I did upanayanam to my son, we did the rit=
uals in open air in our back yard. At the time of brahmopadesa muhurta, I t=
ook my son inside the pooja room where I did my sadhana. I did not allow an=
ybody, including the priests, to come there. I taught the mantra to my son =
in an low, but audible, voice. I repeated a few times, made him repeat it a=
 few times, ensured his pronunciation was correct, and then both of us did =
a maalaa (108 times meditation) with it silently. We then came back to the =
backyard and the rituals continued.

One more thing on muhurta: If you got =
a muhurta from an astrologer you trust and want to follow it, please ensure=
 that Gayatri mantra is taught at that muhurta. THAT is the main event. Som=
e priests put a paste made of cumin seeds and jaggery on the young man's he=
ad at the muhurta time. That is irrelevant and brahmopadesa is the main thi=
ng.

* * *

Though we did a detailed ritual for my son's upanayanam, my own=
 upanayanam was a very simple affair. Though my father is an orthodox braah=
mana following a very simple and austere lifestyle, he is unorthodox in the=
 matter of rituals. Above all, he fearlessly follows his convictions and do=
es not engage in rituals that he does not consider meaningful. He is also a=
gainst following the letter of the rules and breaking the spirit. For examp=
le, when he went to a griha pravesh (housewarming) ceremony once, they were=
 beating a cow to force it to climb stairs to enter the room. People bring =
a cow into the room at the time of housewarming, as they consider a cow to =
symbolize Lakshmi and some steps in the ritual require a cow in the room. A=
s the cow was not happy to climb stairs, they resorted to violence to force=
 it. My father was sad to see the suffering of the cow and told them bluntl=
y that they were doing adharma and there was no point in getting a cow in t=
he
 room like that. But my father puts more value on the spirit of the rule=
s rather than the letter and does not hesitate to speak his mind in front o=
f anybody.

For my upanayanam, he took me to Lord Venkateswara temple in Ti=
rupati/Tirumala, which is his favorite temple. At the time of muhurta, we w=
ere on the hill near the temple. He spent a few hours doing his japam with =
various stotras and I also did japam with several stotras. When the muhurta=
 came, he simply taught me Gayatri mantra and that was it. No rituals of an=
y kind were performed, except for japam for a few hours.

In my opinion, su=
ch a simple approach is also perfectly fine. The key points are that the pe=
rson giving mantra should have done some sadhana, both of them should be in=
 a good and relaxed mood at the time and environment should be peaceful, an=
d, the person receiving mantra should do a lot of sadhana with it later on.=


If a businessman opens an account in his son's name for a new business ve=
nture by the young man, what matters is how much money father gave and how =
well the son used the money, how he ran the new business and how he grew th=
e money. How big a party was held, how many people came and what activities=
 they engaged in is irrelevant in the long run.

* * *

My purpose is not t=
o discourage elaborate rituals. Do them if there is social pressure to do s=
o or you find them interesting. But, atleast ensure that mantropadesa happe=
ns peacefully and correctly. More importantly, ensure that the young man do=
es some sadhana with Gayatri mantra everyday, after upanayanam.

Also, it i=
s perfectly acceptable (and beneficial) to initiate the young person into h=
omam after upanayanam is done. On the same day or a few days later, one can=
 teach a simple version of Ganapathi homam and let the young person perform=
 it by oneself during weekends or so. One can start off with the super-shor=
t procedure and slowly add things. Doing Gayatri mantra everyday and homam =
now and then will accelerate the spiritual evolution of the young person.

Narasimha
