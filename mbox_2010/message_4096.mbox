American Hindu Running for Congress

Mr. John Raghunatha Giuffre has recen=
tly announced his candidacy for Congress in Hawaii's 1st Congressional Dist=
rict representing the city of Honolulu.  He is running as a Republican.  Th=
e election will be held on May 22, 2010.

What makes John's candidacy quite=
 unique, and of special interest to the Hindu, Yoga, and Dharma communities=
, is that John was born and raised in a devoted American Hindu family.  Joh=
n is a lifelong dedicated yogi, vegetarian, environmentalist, and Hindu spi=
ritual practitioner.  John has, in fact, ingeniously incorporated into his =
well-formulated political and economic platform many principles that are de=
rived directly from the philosophical worldview of Sanatana Dharma and Vedi=
c culture!

There has never been a better time, place or platform for us to=
 test run Dharma-based policy proposals on the American political scene. Ou=
r programs are the first generation of hybrid policy initiatives built to i=
ncorporate the wisdom of cultures past for a whole new set of insights and =
possibilities today. 

Please support John's campaign by visiting the websi=
tes below. Share this information with all your friends. You can be a part =
of the potential transformation of history and of the political instantiati=
on of Dharma in your lifetime, and starting in Hawaii!
