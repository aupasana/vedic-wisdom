Nama=
ste,
 
It is perfectly fine to combine the sadhanas of 
different aspects o=
f the Mother, including Lalita and Chandi.
 
Sri Vidya consists of symbolic=
 practices that 
eventually enable one to understand various layers of Maay=
aa surrounding true 
Self. The idea is that one is not bound by Maayaa once=
 one *fully* understands 
and appreciates it.
 
Chandipath consists of symb=
olic stories of wars 
that the divine Mother fought, which explain how one =
can fight and overcome 
various weaknesses that typically bind one in Maaya=
a. Reciting these stories on 
a regular basis will promote the fighting spi=
rit within one that fights these 
weaknesses.
 
There is nothing wrong in u=
nderstanding Maayaa and 
trying to fight/overcome it at the same time. One =
aspect of the Mother creates 
Maayaa. One aspect of the Mother makes you ex=
perience good and bad in that 
Maayaa. One aspect of the Mother makes you u=
nderstand Maayaa to overcome it. One 
aspect of the Mother makes you fight =
and overcome it. When one realizes Self at 
the end, irrespective of the pa=
th taken, one finally sees that all these are 
aspects of a Single Mother w=
ho is also essentially true Self.

=
 
Aghora series books by Svoboda are good, but Aghora 
is not everyone's cu=
p of tea. It is normal to have mixed feelings.
 
Ghora means terrible. Agho=
ra means "not terrible". 
One of the names of Lord Shiva is Aghora. A true =
Aghora (aghori) does not 
see anything as terrible or bad or impure and see=
s all as impermanent 
manifestations of god and tries to focus the thinking=
 of the mind on what is 
permanent (god) always, instead of impermanent man=
ifestations of 
god.
 
When someone dies, north Indians chant "Raama naam 
=
satya hai" while carrying the dead body to the funeral. It means "only the =
name 
of Lord Rama is true and everything else is an illusion". The idea is=
 to remind 
oneself that life and death are just a temporary illusion and o=
nly the Lord is 
real. But the question is: why should we remind ourselves =
of this ultimate truth 
only when someone dies? When someone praises us for=
 a supposedly great thing we 
have done and we are about to feel proud and =
happy, can't we tell ourselves 
"Raama naam satya hai. This thing we did an=
d the praises are temporary 
illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind=
 not dwell on temporary 
illusions"? When we feel attracted to something be=
autiful and want to get it, 
can't we tell ourselves "Raama naam satya hai.=
 This thing that seems beautiful 
and other things that seem not so beautif=
ul are temporary illusions. Only the 
Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell =
on temporary illusions"? When someone 
attacks and abuses us and we are abo=
ut to feel sad or angry, can't we tell 
ourselves "Raama naam satya hai. Th=
ese abuses are temporary illusions. Only the 
Lord is real. Let the mind no=
t dwell on temporary illusions"?"
 
A true Aghora's mind thinks "Raama naam=
 satya hai" 
always. His mind rejects all *impermanent manifestations* of L=
ord (instead of 
*dwelling* on them by classifying them as pure and impure,=
 good and bad etc and 
thinking about them with attraction/aversion ) and t=
ries to find and focus on 
what is permanent. But he takes it to extremes.
=
 
*        
*        *
 
Vedanta says "all is Self. The variety we perceive=
 
is an illusion". An aghora pursues it practically. If feces and fruit are=
 both 
impermenant illusions and the only permanent reality within them is =
the Self, he 
questions why he can eat fruit but not feces. So he may try a=
 ritual where feces 
is eaten. But, please remember that eating 
feces is n=
ot the main point. Perceiving Self in the food being consumed and not 
perc=
eiving an impermanent manifestation of Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main=
 
point. For example, eating feces with disgust serves no purpose, for such=
 a 
person's mind is dwelling on the impermenant manifestation of Self ("fe=
ces") 
while eating it. A successful Aghora may be eating feces, but the mi=
nd will not 
be dwelling on the fact that he is eating "feces" with certain=
 properties and 
will not feel any kind of disgust. He will be thinking tha=
t he is Self and he is 
eating Self.
 
Of course, a vedantin also has the s=
ame notions 
really. He chants vedic verses when eating food, which essenti=
ally mean "I am 
Self and I am consuming Self". Nevertheless, such chanting=
 may merely be a 
ritual and not be fully absorbed in one's thinking. As he=
 eats, his mind may 
dwell on the impermanant manifestations of Self ("a ta=
sty laddu", "a badly 
cooked brinjal curry", "a overly salty cracker" etc) =
and waver from the focus on 
the permanent (Self).
 
Thus, a vedantin and a=
n aghora are telling 
themselves the same truth and trying to absorb that t=
ruth into every thought and 
impulse. But aghora is putting himself in an e=
xtreme situation where failure 
results in a very bad dual experience. That=
 can in fact work as an incentive in 
forcing one to transcend duality! In =
the case of a person who chants a Vedic 
verse that says "I am Self and I a=
m consuming Self" and eats tasty laddus and 
nicely made food, the fallout =
from failing to absorb the mind in Self while 
eating is not too bad. If th=
e mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice) 
taste of a laddu or other =
food, what is the big deal? On the other hand, if the 
mind fails to absorb=
 in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it will be so 
disgusting. Thus,=
 the fact that failure results in a very bad dual experience 
may act as an=
 incentive in succeeding quickly.
 
However, difficult tasks cannot necessa=
rily be 
accomplished by everyone merely because of an incentive. Not every=
one trying 
Aghora sadhanas succeeds.
 
*        
*        *
 
Take another=
 simple example. Suppose someone is doing a lot of sadhana, 
like japam and=
 homam, and yet having a weakness for sex. Suppose one's mind is 
dwelling =
on sex or getting sexual thoughts in the middle of sadhana and that is 
cau=
sing guilt and blocking one's sadhana.
 
A regular person will try to enfor=
ce celibacy and keep the mind away from 
sexual thoughts. But that is nor a=
 formula for overcoming such thoughts. After 
all, such thoughts may still =
come and distract one. Even if one keeps celibacy 
for 10 years, there is n=
o guarantee that the fascination in the mind does not 
return to bite one a=
fter that. But, how to overcome the fascination some minds 
may have for se=
x?
 
An aghora will take it to an extreme. He will try to fix the root caus=
e and 
remove fascination from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and sex=
 as two 
different activities (one pure and the other impure), he may combi=
ne them into 
one without such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an a=
ghora sits naked 
with his partner sitting naked on his lap and then does h=
is japam. In the 
beginning, this may titillate and result in sex. He may t=
hink that his sadhana 
is being made impure. But, suppose he persists to do=
 japam like that for several 
months/years. Eventually, mind may be reprogr=
ammed. He may no longer feel that 
he is doing something impure. He may no =
longer feel titillation. The association 
in his mind between nakedness and=
 sex may be broken down. Seeing naked pictures 
physically or mentally may =
no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts 
of meditation. Any sma=
ll thoughts related to sex that suddenly rise in the head 
may not lead to =
denser and denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in 
sadhana, but=
 they may now take the mind back to meditation. After spending so 
much tim=
e in meditation while sitting naked intimately, the attraction and 
thrill =
mind may feel for nakedness or intimacy may be broken down. Overall, the 
p=
erson's fascination and weakness for sex may be gone largely.
 
Mind has a =
lot of conditioning based on prior experiences and the thoughts 
we are exp=
osed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break down some of these structures 
by =
engaging in certain practices that undermine those structures.
 
However, i=
s this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is also possible that 
the perso=
n keeps on engaging in the practice merely for sex and thinks of sex 
every=
time he sits for meditation (instead of thinking of meditation everytime he=
 
sees naked partner), if one was not serious/sincere/ ready to start with.=

 
*        
*        *
 Bottomline is that an aghora takes problems and we=
aknesses head 
on and sets up a high stakes fight with them, whereas a norm=
al person may push 
the problems under the carpet and fight slowly and with=
 low stakes. Such a risky 
strategy is not applicable to all.
 
*        
*=
        *
 Like Manish said in a mail earlier, "what is Vedanta and what 
i=
s Aghora"? Aghora is merely a practical way to understand and absorb Vedant=
a in 
one's thought process, by setting up a high stakes war plan. However,=
 it is 
certainly not suitable for all and many may feel aversion. More dan=
gerously, 
some people may feel attraction for it based on a wrong understa=
nding and the 
thrill such an understanding brings. Aghora stands for neith=
er thrills nor 
perversion, though it *may* attract some people pursuing th=
rills and/or 
perversion. The basic tenets of Aghora and Vedanta/Upanishads=
 are the same, but 
Aghora tries to accelerates how one absorbs the truth i=
nto one's thinking by 
making failure very unpleasant.
 
BTW, the following=
 mail gives a good analogy for various spiritual paths 
and explains the ba=
sic reality. It may be interesting to read in the context of 
aghora.

<div>Take another si=
mple example. Suppose someone is doing a lot of sadhana, 
like japam and ho=
mam, and yet having a weakness for sex. Suppose one's mind is 
dwelling on =
sex or getting sexual thoughts in the middle of sadhana and that is 
causin=
g guilt and blocking one's sadhana.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A regular =
person will try to enforce celibacy and keep the mind away from 
sexual tho=
ughts. But that is nor a formula for overcoming such thoughts. After 
all, =
such thoughts may still come and distract one. Even if one keeps celibacy 
=
for 10 years, there is no guarantee that the fascination in the mind does n=
ot 
return to bite one after that. But, how to overcome the fascination som=
e minds 
may have for sex?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>An aghora will take=
 it to an extreme. He will try to fix the root cause and 
remove fascinatio=
n from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and sex as two 
different activ=
ities (one pure and the other impure), he may combine them into 
one withou=
t such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an aghora sits naked 
with h=
is partner sitting naked on his lap and then does his japam. In the 
beginn=
ing, this may titillate and result in sex. He may think that his sadhana 
i=
s being made impure. But, suppose he persists to do japam like that for sev=
eral 
months/years. Eventually, mind may be reprogrammed. He may no longer =
feel that 
he is doing something impure. He may no longer feel titillation.=
 The association 
in his mind between nakedness and sex may be broken down.=
 Seeing naked pictures 
physically or mentally may no longer evoke thoughts=
 of sex, but evoke thoughts 
of meditation. Any small thoughts related to s=
ex that suddenly rise in the head 
may not lead to denser and denser though=
ts relating to sex and distraction in 
sadhana, but they may now take the m=
ind back to meditation. After spending so 
much time in meditation while si=
tting naked intimately, the attraction and 
thrill mind may feel for nakedn=
ess or intimacy may be broken down. Overall, the 
person's fascination and =
weakness for sex may be gone largely.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Mind has=
 a lot of conditioning based on prior experiences and the thoughts 
we are =
exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break down some of these structures 
=
by engaging in certain practices that undermine those structures.</div>
<di=
v> </div>
<div>However, is this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is=
 also possible that 
the person keeps on engaging in the practice merely fo=
r sex and thinks of sex 
everytime he sits for meditation (instead of think=

<div> </div>Like Manish said in a mail earlier, "what =

is Aghora"? Aghora is merely a practical way to unders=

one's thought process, by setting up a high sta=

certainly not suitable for all and many may f=
eel aversion. More dangerously, 
some people may feel attraction for it bas=
ed on a wrong understanding and the 
thrill such an understanding brings.&n=
bsp;Aghora stands for neither thrills nor 
perversion, though it *may* attr=
act some people pursuing thrills and/or 
perversion. The basic tenets of Ag=

Aghora tries to accelerates =

          PM<br><br>Dear Sri Narasimharao garu,<br><br=
>I am very much in awe 
          after I learnt that you do chandi homam e=
veryday. You also wrote that 
          it takes about 1.25 hours to 1.5 ho=
urs to do your chandi homam. How 
          can you accomplish that feat wi=
th 700 ahutis in such a short time? 
          Also, in my case, I do sandh=
yavandanam with 108 Gayatri (20 
          minutes)+ganapathi mantra japam =
108 times(10 minutes), a short rudra 
          Abhishekam with pachakshari=
, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 minutes) 
          totalling to about 35 - 40 =
minutes daily ritual. Plus I sometimes do 
          special rituals severa=
l times a week, that takes about 1 to 1.5 hours 
          in all. How to i=
ntegrate these along with homam? Is Sri vidyopasana 
          different fr=
om Chandi homam? Could you please explain what is sri 
          Vidya and =
how it is to be learnt? I am very motivated to learn what 
          the De=
vi Mahatmayam is all about but I also have keen interest in Sri 
          =
Vidya, because I am a musician also and learnt all the nava-avarna
