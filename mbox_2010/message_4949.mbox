Namaste Utpal/Somanath/Rajarshi

I have done mental homam (in my own way), =
however as Vimalananda puts it, requires tremendous amount of visualization=
 power and connection to your deity! Which means the bad karmas have to be =
sufficiently removed, for which we need the aid of an external homam. 

In =
the example given by Vimalananda, a farmer performing mental homam, was abl=
e to manifest yogurt (which he offered as naivedyam), such intense was his =
concentration and visualization!

So, it is better to stick with external h=
omam and eventually the internal/mental homam will work. I know I have a lo=
ng way to go, so I will stick with the external one :).

Regards
Narayan
