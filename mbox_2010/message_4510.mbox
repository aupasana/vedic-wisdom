 Such priests and temples are quite rare today. Do not expect one pooja, on=

Absolutely. We should have nothing against them. Giving them money or helpi=
ng them or engaging them is perfectly noble. My only point is that *most* (=
though not all) of them have no ability to give a boost to the material and=
 spiritual pursuit of others (like many priests of old days did) and hence =
people should not leave the remedying of their problem completely to the pr=
iest (they are very likely to be disappointed that way). If they realize th=
at they are on their own and do something about it, they are more likely to=
 succeed over time.

 about the end are a different ball game. They are mostly an intellectual e=
xercise and can be done well by one without spiritual energy. But, doing a =
ritual for someone and giving a boost to one's material and spiritual pursu=
its (using one's own spiritual energy by using the ritual as a tool) is a s=
piritual exercise and one without a good level of spiritual energy cannot d=
o it well. These days, people hardly have enough spiritual energy to fix th=
eir own blockages and how can they take care of others?
