 A visitor started wailing before Bhagavan that he was being quite crushed
=
under the enormity of his sins.

Bhagavan asked: "When you sleep, are you a=
 sinner?"

D: "No, I am just asleep."

Bh: "If you are not a sinner, then y=
ou must be good."

D: "No, I am neither good nor bad when I am asleep. I kn=
ow nothing about
myself."

Bh: "And what do you know about yourself now? Yo=
u say you are a sinner. You
say so because you think so. Were you pleased w=
ith yourself, you would call
yourself a good man and stop telling me about =
your being a sinner. What do
you know about good and evil except what is in=
 your mind? When you see that
the mind invents everything, all will vanish.=
 The good will vanish, the evil
will vanish, and you will remain as you are=
."

Dr. Syed was a Muslim scholar and a great devotee of Bhagavan. His wife=
 too
became a devotee without losing her faith in the ways and conventions =
of the
Muslim religion. She would not appear before other men. Stealthily s=
he would
come to the Ashram, hide herself in one of the rooms and implore h=
er husband
to ask Bhagavan to come to see her. It was a most unusual reques=
t, but such
was Bhagavan's grace and compassion that even this was granted.=
 Mrs. Syed
would at first keep silent, rather than talk to Bhagavan through=
 her veil;
then later she would talk to him without a veil. But it took a l=
ong time for
her to venture into the Hall without a veil and sit there like=
 everybody
else.

Dr. Syed and his wife used to stay in a rented house outs=
ide the Ashram and
cook their own food. One day she felt a very strong desi=
re to invite
Bhagavan to their house for food. She nagged her husband, but =
he did not
have the courage to request something so unusual. Meeting his wi=
fe outside
the Hall was unusual enough, and twice he had asked Bhagavan to =
consent to
it; that Bhagavan should go to their house for food seemed unthi=
nkable. But
the intrepid lady went on pressing her husband until he became =
more afraid
of her than of the enormity of her request and hinted her wish =
to Bhagavan,
who smiled and kept quiet. She would not give up. She was cert=
ain that
Bhagavan would grant her wish if the matter were put before him in=
 the
proper spirit and form. At last, while Bhagavan was going up the hill,=
 Dr.
Syed and his wife stood before him and told him her desire. Bhagavan j=
ust
laughed and went up the hill.

When they returned home in the evening, =
there was quite a row in their
house, she accusing him that he had not aske=
d Bhagavan in the proper way. At
last he had enough of it all and said to h=
er: "How am I responsible? The
truth of the matter is that your devotion is=
 deficient. That is the reason
why Bhagavan refused." These words of his mu=
st have touched her deeply and
she sat in meditation throughout the night. =
She wanted by sheer intensity of
prayer to bring Bhagavan to dinner. During=
 the early hours of the morning
she must have dozed. Bhagavan appeared to h=
er in a dream or vision and told
her: "Why are you so obstinate? How can I =
leave the Ashram and come to your
house for food? I must dine along with ot=
hers, or they won't eat. Besides,
as you know, people are coming from dista=
nt places, facing a lot of trouble
to see me and to have food with me. How =
can I leave all these guests and
come to your place? Feed three devotees of=
 mine and it will be the same as
feeding me. I shall be fully satisfied." I=
n her vision she saw the three
devotees whom she had to invite. One was Dr.=
 Melkote, the second Swami
Prabuddhananda and the third was myself.

She to=
ld of her vision to Dr. Syed, who invited all the three for food in
his hou=
se, telling us that we could not possibly refuse. We were astonished
and as=
ked him the reason. Dr. Syed told us the whole story. We were all
Brahmins =
and, although we were delighted to represent Bhagavan at the feast,
we were=
 afraid of what the Ashram Brahmins would say. For a Brahmin to eat
in a Mu=
slim's house is a serious breach of convention.

Dr. Melkote was in the gue=
st room near the flower garden. I went to him and
asked him, "What are you =
thinking about?"
"I am thinking of the dinner at Syed's place."
"Are you go=
ing?"
"I wonder. They are Muslims."
''If we go, we are bound to get into a =
lot of trouble."
"Yes, they may turn us out of the Ashram."
"Then are you g=
oing?"
"I am going," said Dr. Melkote. "I am taking it as Bhagavan's direct=
 order.
Otherwise, how could Mrs. Syed pick us? How could she know our name=
s and
faces so as to show us to her husband?"
"Prabuddhananda can go, for h=
e is a sannyasi and can eat anywhere. Besides,
he is not afraid of the Ashr=
am authorities, for he cooks his own food. But
we are taking serious risks,=
" I said.
"Well," said Dr. Melkote, "we are going, and Bhagavan will attend=
 to the
risks."

In spite of these brave words Dr. Melkote was perplexed. W=
e were to dine in
a Muslim's house. Even if the food were vegetarian, what =
about the kitchen
and vessels? What do Muslims know about the Brahmin rules=
 and habits
concerning cleanliness? How would we explain our going to a Mus=
lim house for
food? Why should we trust the vision of some Muslim lady? Cou=
ld we really
say that we were merely obeying Bhagavan's orders? Who would b=
elieve us?
Surely not the Ashram Brahmins! And what an assortment we three =
made! One
was a Kanarese householder, the other an Andhra bachelor, the thi=
rd a
Bengali sannyasi!

The next day when the bell for dinner was rung, we =
three went before
Bhagavan and bowed. Bhagavan did not ask us the reason, h=
e merely looked at
us. Instead of going to the dining hall with others we m=
arched out of the
Ashram, passing before Chinnaswami who-O wonder!-did not =
ask us why we were
going out without taking food.

Mrs. Syed got up early i=
n the morning, swept the kitchen and washed the
vessels carefully herself. =
She would not allow the servant girl to enter the
kitchen. She had been sco=
lded repeatedly by her relatives and the Muslim
Moulvis for her devotion to=
 a Hindu saint. She told them that while she used
to say her prayers she wo=
uld see the Prophet standing by her side. Since she
met Bhagavan, the Proph=
et had disappeared and Bhagavan was coming to watch
her pray. So great was =
her devotion!

After getting everything quite clean, she lovingly prepared =
dish after dish,
and when we arrived, we found the food excellent. After th=
e meal she offered
us betel with her own hands.

When we were returning to =
the Ashram, Dr. Melkote had tears in his eyes. He
said: "I come from Hydera=
bad and I know well the Muslim ways and customs. A
Muslim lady will give be=
tel leaves with her own hands to nobody except her
husband or a fakir (a sa=
int). In her eyes we were fakirs, the forms Bhagavan
took to go to her plac=
e."

When we returned to the Ashram we were astonished that nobody enquired=
 why
we had not been present in the dining hall, where we had gone or what =
we did
in a Muslim's house. How wonderfully does Bhagavan protect those who=
 obey
him!
