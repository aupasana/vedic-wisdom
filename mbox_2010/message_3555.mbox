Namaste,

Many sadhakas have worshipped Veerabhadra in the past. But I pers=
onally do not know good mantras of Veerabhadra.

Sati, a form of divine Mot=
her, was the daughter of Daksha prajapati. She married Shiva against his wi=
shes and he was not pleased. When he did a big yajna once, he did not invit=
e Shiva. When he insulted Shiva at the yajna, Sati self-immolated making a =
wish that She be born again to a worthy father. Shiva became mad and create=
d Veerabhadra to fight Daksha's army. Sati was re-born to Himavaan as Paarv=
ati and married Shiva again. That is the story in a nutshell.

Esoterically=
 speaking, Shiva represents the true Self. The word Sati comes from sat, i.=
e. to be or to exist. Sati means the one who is or who exists. Sati represe=
nts the self-awareness, which enables us to be and to exist. Prajapati is t=
he creator of all beings. Prajapati is associated with the brahma granthi i=
n Mooladhaara chakra. Self-awareness is usually stationed in Moolaadhaara. =
Sati marrying Shiva represents self-awareness joining true Self, i.e. samad=
hi.

Daksha (means "skillful one") Prajapati's yajna represents rituals and=
 sadhanas performed for acquiring skills and success in the material plane.=
 Obviously, Shiva (true Self) is not welcome here. When self-awareness with=
draws temporarily from the union with true Self and attends to the efforts =
at the material level, it finds that these efforts are disinterested in tru=
e Self. It is aghast.

Himavaan (the icy mountain of Himalaya), on the othe=
r hand, symbolizes grand firm detachment. Ice symbolizes detachment and the=
 mountain symbolizes firmness. When the Divine Mother immolated herself, sh=
e was reborn as the daughter of Himavaan. This symbolizes self-awareness cu=
tting off its relation to the material-mindedness and efforts to acquire sk=
ills and success and instead being rooted in very firm dispassion. In this =
state, self-awareness can be in union with true Self.

Veerabhadra (heroic/=
chief well-being) destroying Daksha Prajapati and his army symbolizes overc=
oming the material attachments and desire to acquire skills and success in =
the material plane. People think that "well-being" lies in having a healthy=
 body, good home, happy family, reasonable wealth, good job etc. But those =
kinds of well-being are temporary and perish. The chief well-being lies in =
not having attachment to or dependence on any perishable thing and be able =
to see pleasure and pain alike. Such heroic and ultimate spirit of well-bei=
ng is personified by Veerabhadra. When Veerabhadra shines in one, naturally=
 all desires to acquire skills and success vanish.

As I said before, all s=
tories in our scriptures have deeper significance and they are NOT silly st=
ories made up by idle people.

Best regards,
Narasimha

Thanks for starting and nurturing su=
