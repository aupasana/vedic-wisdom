Sri Narasimha Garu,=C2=A0
I agree with your point..."I humbly suggest that=
 our critical abilities should not be wasted on people and things that we d=
o not have a responsibility to change"
but, what if one among the immediate=
 family members has a penchant towards one such not so=C2=A0genuinely=C2=A0=
looking guru's? can we be really be having the attitude of "Apne ko kya len=
a dena" or can/should we be doing anything here?
Apologies =C2=A0for being =
a poke
ThanksKK

Namaste,

There may indee=

However, I humbly suggest that our critical abilities should not =
be wasted on people and things that we do not have a responsibility to chan=
ge. Critical abilities should be directed inward to critique oneself, towar=
ds people one has a responsibility towards, such as one's sishyas, and towa=
rds things where one has a duty to accomplish something. Why criticize othe=
r people? Let them engage in their games and make progress at their own pac=
e. Apne ko kya lena dena (what have we got to do with them)?

 

Best regar=

Narasimha
