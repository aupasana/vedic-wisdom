Hello,
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Few days ago I had a dream. I saw Nar=
asimha and Rajarshi standing in a line/queue together. I had no difficulty =
in recognising Narasimha as he had appeared in my room at night several yea=
rs ago and his picture is on video. I knew immediately in dream that other =
person is Rajarshi although I do not know him.

Hay guys, what you were doi=
ng in that line? Were you queueing for nirvekalp or sahaja samadhi or simil=
ar hocus pocus or just mundane new years sale?

I saw Rajarshi so clearly t=
hat I would have recognised him among several persons in physical world but=
 now the image has become very dim in my memory. 

It was good to see=A0 yo=
u both.
LaxmiNarayan
