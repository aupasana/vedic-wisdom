Namaste Shreya,

A lady can do Chandi homam. I did other homams previously =
but=C2=A0did the Chandi homam yesterday for the first time. I was very nerv=
ous I did lot of mistakes but like you said if soul is clean does no harm. =
If you haven't done any homam so far I suggest you start with Ganesha homam=
=C2=A0or the god you like to get familiar with the ritual. Directly going t=
o chandi homam would be very tedious.=C2=A0It takes 5 hours easily for begi=
nners. Shri Narsimha ji suggests, homam is most effective when done during =
sunrise and sunset but not at night. 
Hope this helps!
Prm

 Pranam!!

I would like to thank you for all your kind and effective advice=
s. I would like to know that usually I do Navratri puja in the evening so c=
an I do the Homam in the evening ?

One more thing I am a lady so can I do =
Chandi Homam? I just Love ma Durga as I love my own mother for which I feel=
 she can not harm me until unless I do something very wrong in my conciousn=
ess. I am married and till now no child.

Please let me know till now I hav=
e not done any homam on my own but want to do from my heart. I have a bit m=
ore interest in Religious follows and want to learn but here people are so =
much commercial that I do not think any body ( atleast the pandit ji I know=
) will tech me, and they may say something for which my husband will get sc=
ared and will not allow me anymore. So now when God has given me the chance=
 to get help from=C2=A0a guru like you I=C2=A0do not want to miss the chanc=
e.

As far as I am concerned I=C2=A0am deciple of Sri Sri RamKrishan Param =
Hansa and got Diksha from Ramkrishna Math on 07-01-2003 ( I remember the da=
te as because just after my diksha my life changed like a Magic)

I know my=
 letter is a bit long but please do read I=C2=A0have a lot of hope that I w=
ill get genuine advice from you=C2=A0

Waiting for your kind=C2=A0advice
Th=
anks & Regards

Shreya
