Welcome Mitesh,

Many a times I thought of you and missed your posts for a =
long time!

>Always try to increase the bhava and not other physical parame=
ters >like doing japam for 2 hours versus 30 minutes or doing homan daily >=
versus weekly etc....

No disputes about the Bhava. That is the core of any=
 rituals. The Atma of any Saadhana.
But I feel necessary to mention few wor=
ds here so that what you have written is not misunderstood. As we all know =
quite well that Mind does not want to engage in Spiritual Saadhana. Mind wi=
ll convince the own fraction and play all kinds of tricks to induce flexibi=
lity in any saadhana and finally drag one completely away from any Spiritua=
l Saadhana. Though it is a must to try and develop Bhava in any rituals, It=
 is also very important to keep doing things at whatever regularity possibl=
e. *Flexibility* may prove a pitfall many a times.

Following are delightfu=
l reading for me.

> The progress here in some ways is measurable how ever =
I must submit there is always a long way to go, it may take many lifetimes.=

times when you try to do good, you get a lot of bad in return, may be it is=
 all part of cleansing :-).

BTW Akshay Tritiya is yet to come. i dont know=
 when. May be Manish or Narasimha may be knowing.

Best Regards,

Utpal
