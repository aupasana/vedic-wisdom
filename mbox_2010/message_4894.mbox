Namaste,
  Instead of blowing air can i fan (manually, using a cardboard  o=
r using a table fan etc...) to get the fire back, sometimes because of exce=
ssive wind etc... the fire stops all of a sudden (i am seeing this only aft=
er started using firewood, but never happened with dry coconut pieces) and =
in that case i ignite a camphor piece from the lamp that i took the fire in=
itially for agnipratissthApana and drop it in homa kundaM. In this case sho=
uld i say any praayashchitta mantra or the mantra used for agnipratissthApa=
na initially (OM bhuurbhuvassuvarom).

Thank You,
hari sarma.

   Namaste! What do the sastras say about what we should do when we have to=
 answer the call of nature during a homa ? For japa, the rules are clear to=
 me- do the same rules apply for homa ? If for example we must get up and g=

we add more wood/cow dung/samit and go ?
