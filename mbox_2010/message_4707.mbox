 "Glory to Sri Ramana the Sage,
Who firmly established in devotion
to the L=
otus-feet of Arunachaleswara,
can undo the evil of the world and
the misery=
 of those who take refuge
in Him. Glory to Ramana,
glowing with merciful lo=
ve for all."

"Bhagavan Sri Ramana's Realization is unique
and unparalleled=
 in the annals of history.
He realised in his boyhood the Eternal Truth,
th=
e Self Supreme, without the aid of initiation
by any external Guru, without=
 the need for
theoretical knowledge and without any study
of the Scriptures=
, and without having resorted
to any ritualistic form of worship.....other =
than
his spontaneous realization of the eternal nature
of the "I", the Self=
 Supreme."

The sense of body is a thought;
the thought is of the mind,
The=
 mind rises after the "I"-thought,
the "I"-thought is the root-thought.
If =
that is held,
the other thoughts will disappear.
There will be no body,
no =
mind, not even the ego;
only the Self in all its purity.

To remain as the =
Self
is not difficult.

Why should one think of birth and death?
Are you re=
ally born?
....all these are only of the mind.
So long as the body is consi=
dered,
birth is real. But the body is not "I".
The Self is not born, nor do=
es it die.
There is nothing new.
The Sages see everything as being
in and o=
f the Self;
there is no diversity in it,
Therefore, there is neither birth =
nor death.

The soul remains always uncontaminated.
It is the substratum fu=
nning through these three states:
Wakefulness passes off, I Am
the dream st=
ate passes off, I Am;
the sleep states passes off, I Am;
They repeat themse=
lves,
and yet "I Am" remains.
They are like pictures
moving on a screen at =
the cinema show.
They do not affect the screen.
"I Am" remains unaffected..=
.

Any new appearances are bound to disappear.
Anything created will certai=
nly be destroyed.
The eternal is not born nor does it die.
We are now confo=
unding appearances with reality.
Appearance carries its end in itself.
What=
 is it that appears newly?
If you cannot find it, surrender unreservedly
to=
 the substratum of appearances;
then, the reality remains as residue.

Enga=
ge yourself in the living present.
The future will take care of itself.
Do =
not worry about the future.

Doubts cease when the confusion is surpassed.
=

Engage in self-investigation,
then the non-self will disappear.
The Self w=
ill be left over.
This is self-investigation of the Self.
The one word "Sel=
f"
is equivalent to the mind,
body, man, individual,
the Supreme and all el=
se.

The Real is That what is;
the others are only appearances.
Diversity i=
s not its nature.
We are reading the printed characters
on paper, but ignor=
e the paper
which is the background.
Similarly, you are taken up by the man=
ifestations
of the mind, and let go the background.
Whose fault is it?

Is =
there a difference between the
individual soul and the Self?
That is what I=
S.

The mind obstructs the innate peace.
Our investigation is only in the m=
ind.
Investigate the mind;
then it will disappear.
There is no entity by th=
e name "mind."
Because of the emergence of thoughts,
we surmise something f=
rom which they start;
that we term "mind."
When we probe to see what it is,=

there is nothing of the sort.
After it has vanished,
Peace will be found t=
o remain eternal.
