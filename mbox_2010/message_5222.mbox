Namaste

I think Narasimha Ji answered this very beautifully previously sta=
ting the following. I might be misintrepreting some stuff with my reposting=
 , also kindly search for the message in the group.

1.Lord Brahma is the a=
rchitect of the world and the world is nothing but his dream projection.

2=
.Having gotten trapped in this dream projection all beings need to escape t=
his dream reality to find salvation.

Brahmaji's function is to create very=
 beautiful elaborate worlds....and he is fully capable of granting that to =
his worshippers. What is the point of gaining power over creating worlds wh=
en the whole goal of sadhana is to move beyond it .

Narasimha ji has also =
mentioned the following previously .Notice the shaktis of the trimurtis.

1=
.Lord Brahma- To create one needs Knowledge and Goddess Saraswati is the fo=
rm of Knowledge and wisdom.

2.Lord Vishnu- To sustain one needs wealth and=
 Goddess Lakshmi is the form of all kinds of weath both material and spirit=
ual.

3.Lord Shiva- To dissolve one needs energy or shakti and Goddess Parv=
ati is the form of Shakti.
