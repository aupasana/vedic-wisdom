Sindhu ji

I wish to only comment on the following statement you passed.

"=
Look at Brihadaranyakopanishad, similar elevated status is given to the hor=
se sacrificed in asvamedha (Usha vaa asvasya medhyasya sirah ..........)."
=


The Ashwamedha is not a horse sacrifice.This is the problem with verbal i=
ntrepretations. Once again this is the mischief perpetuated by the likes of=
 Wendy Doninger and her harvard based colleagues with a vested interest in =
perpetuating the myth of aryan invasion and a nomadic society.

The Correct=
 meaning of Ashwamedha has been explained by Aurobindo(Savitri,Secret of th=
e Veda )  as previously mentioned by Narasimha Ji .

Also the real meaning =
of Usha is well explained by Aurobindo unlike the textbook verbal translati=
on of Usha by Frits Staal which was posted by you below. 


Also I do not p=
ossess the knowledge as much as Narasimha ji , Rajarishi ji or the other le=
arned members do. However wish to ask you the same simple question Narasimh=
a ji asked.

1.If Narasimha ji has not termed his manual vedic ..What exact=
ly is your objection.

2.Is is better to create a system where everybody ca=
n come into contact with the divine and do a small homa everybody Or Should=
 people be  told to do 4 hr elaborate rituals which they might do intially =
and then get turned off due to lack of time.

3.Why have all the spiritual =
masters in the past tried to be very inclusive and placed emphasis on japa,=
 tapa ,sankeertana and homa instead of elaborate rituals and temple buildin=
g.

4.Do you beleive one's caste is gained by birth.


Regards
Vemparla Ram=

te than what we teach and some more brief. I do not care exactly what proce=
dure one uses and I will be happy if more and more people do homam *regular=

e for those who do not know any. If you are initiated into a different proc=
edure that you can do daily, please go ahead and do it daily the way you kn=

 be done daily, please consider what I taught, which is simple enough to do=
 daily.

tal in mortals. Its rhythm will devour everything that is perishable and pu=

faithfully followed the instructions [rituals].
> 
> People started moving =
further and further inland and started living in a landlocked desert far aw=
ay from the sea. This generation had never seen a pool of water like a lake=
, let alone a sea. They faithfully performed the ritual of walking towards =
east, but did not find sea. They debated endlessly whether one had to walk =
one mile or two miles or three miles and formed different schools of though=
t. Some walked their chosen distance, found a tree or a building or some in=
teresting object and even became satisfied that that was sea!
> 
> Then cam=
e some great person, whose instincts led him to take a horse instead of wal=
king and ride it for a long distance [use of other tools]. He did find the =
sea after a few months. He put together newer instructions to reach the sea=
, which included riding a horse [new =C3=A4gama and tantra].
> 
> People pe=
rforming the old rituals objected to this and said "but then this horse thi=
ng is not granted by the book of sea. This is a new path and different from=
 the "pure" sea ritual" [pure Vedic ritual]. By now, people did not even un=
derstand what the cryptic poems of the original "book of sea" mean, but the=
y simply believed that those poems taught the old "pure" sea rituals that t=
hey were used to. They were blissfully unaware that the original instructio=
ns were meant for someone already close to sea and the newer instructions c=
ame from someone who actually saw the sea and knew where they currently liv=
ed and how to get to the sea from there!
>

uctions involving horses, chariots etc were taught and many new paths to th=

 [evolution of mantra/tantra/ yantras].

ngles was dangerous [aghora and other dark tantric paths involving practice=
 of sex, meat, wine etc]. Though the distance to sea was much shorter throu=
gh that jungle, it was just too dangerous and only the bravest and stronges=
t could make it. There were cruel dacoits and wild animals [chance of a fal=
l in a risky ritual] and many weak people travelling to sea via that path w=
ere killed. A wise man who knew the entire territory well came forward, con=
demned that path and discouraged people from trying that path. Since then, =
even people who were strong enough to successfully make it in that path des=
isted from it.

out whose path was superior. They were foolish, not smart enough to adopt t=

-called "new" path or other variations, for the changed geography and chang=
ed times. Many followed the instructions blindly, hit roadblocks and did no=
t reach sea. Many did not even know that "reaching the sea" was the actual =
goal of all their joirneys. They only thought they were supposed to follow =
the instructions faithfully and there was no need to adopt to the changed g=
eographical territory and time. They even condemned those who actually went=
 to sea, came back and gave updated directions for their place and time, fo=
r violating tradition.
> 
> In case the analogy is not clear, here is a bri=
ef summary of its points. Veda is about realizing self. Vedic deities such =
as Agni, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Aswins, Brihaspati etc are slightly differen=
t aspects of Aatman. Veda describes various aspects of the state of self-re=
alization. That is why it is considered the highest knowledge. Other allied=
 subjects throw some light on possible ways to reach that state. While defi=
nitive and absolute statements can be made on the actual state of self-real=
ization itself, no definitive statements can be made on how to reach it. On=
ly relative statements can be made based on desa-kaala-paatra. The path dep=
ends on one's current position!
> 
> Great men in many spiritual paths, wit=
hin Hinduism as well as outside of it, came, experienced that state, unders=
tood the current state of people around them and gave specific instructions=
 on how to reach that state from the current state. Some followed the instr=
uctions and experienced the state. Some instead kept arguing about the cont=
radictions between paths.
> 
> Stop Arguing and Do Sadhana
> 
> As the meta=
phor above illustrates, arguments about various paths are irrelevant and di=
stracting. What is important is to pick a path and follow it. Whether one d=
oes a Vedic homam or an Aagamic homam is a secondary issue. The primary iss=
ues are whether one does homam or not, how focused one is, how one=E2=80=99=
s focus is improving and how one is being transformed internally.

 as a twenty course meal eaten once every six months does not give much ene=
rgy to one, a =E2=80=9Cbig=E2=80=9D homam or another ritual done once every=
 six months or a year does not boost one=E2=80=99s spiritual or material pu=
