 The questioner asked again: "But first of all we must find a Guru who can
=
give us sufficient practice and thereby enable us to get rid of these gunas=
,
mustn't we?"

"If we have the earnestness to get rid of these qualities c=
an we not find a
Guru? We must first have the desire to get rid of them. Wh=
en once we have
this the Guru will himself come, searching for us; or, he w=
ill somehow
manage to draw us to himself. The Guru will always be on the al=
ert and keep
an eye on us; Iswara himself will show us the Guru. Who else w=
ill look after
the welfare of the children except the father himself? He is=
 always with us,
surrounding us. He protects us, as a bird protects its egg=
s by hatching them
under the shelter of its wings. But we must have whole-h=
earted faith in
Him," said Bhagavan

All bad qualities center around the eg=
o.
When the ego is gone,
Realization results by itself.
There are neither g=
ood nor bad
qualities in the Self.
The Self is free from all qualities.
Qua=
lities pertain to the mind only.
The Self is beyond quality.
If there is un=
ity,
there will also be duality.
The numeral one gives rise to other number=
s.
The truth is neither one nor two.
It is as it is.

Realization is alread=
y there.
The state free from thoughts
is the only real state.
There is no s=
uch action as Realization.
Is there anyone
who is not realizing the Self?
D=
oes anyone deny his own existence?
Speaking of Realization,
it implies two =
selves.
The one to realize--
the other to be realized.
What is not already =
realized
is sought to be realized.
Once we admit our existence,
how is it t=
hat we do not know our Self?

If we look on the Self as the ego
then we bec=
ome the ego.
if as the mind we become the mind,
if as the body we become th=
e body.
It is the thought which builds up sheaths
in so many ways.
The shad=
ow on the water
is found to be shaking.
Can anyone stop this shaking?
If it=
 would cease to shake
you would not know the water
but only the light.
Simi=
larly, take no notice of the ego
and its activities
but see only the light =
behind it.
The ego is the "I" thought.
The true "I" is the Self.

Devotee: =
>From where do these objects arise?

Bhagavan: Just from where you rise. Kno=
w the subject first and then question
about the object.

Devotee: It is onl=
y one aspect of the question.

Bhagavan: The subject comprehends the object=
 also. That one aspect is an
all-comprehensive aspect. See yourself first a=
nd then see the objects. What
is not in you cannot appear outside.

Devotee=
: I am not satisfied.

Bhagavan: Satisfaction can be only when you reach th=
e source. Otherwise
restlessness exists.

M.: Make effort. Just as water is got by boring a well, so also you realis=
e
the Self by investigation.

D.: Yes. But some find water readily and othe=
rs with difficulty.

M.: But you already see the moisture on the surface. Y=
ou are hazily aware of
the Self. Pursue it. When the effort ceases the Self=
 shines forth.

D.: How to train the mind to look within?

M.: By practice.=
 The mind is the intelligent phase leading to its own
destruction, for Self=
 to manifest.

Even the ignorant man
sees only the Self
when he sees object=
s.
But he is confused
and identifies the Self with the object;
the body and=
 the senses,
and plays in the world.
Subject and object --
all merge in the=
 Self.
There is no seer or objects seen.
The seer and the seen are the Self=
.
There are not many selves, either,
All are only one Self.

Look at your S=
elf or Atma, rather than anywhere else. The eyes may be kept
open or closed=
 - it is immaterial. There is only one I, whether you spell it
'I' or 'eye'=
. There is no point in opening or closing the eyes.Attention
must be focuss=
ed on the inner 'I'.

You are not an eye that can be opened or closed. You =
may close or open the
eyes according to your liking or inclination. It is i=
mmaterial and not
important. You will cease to think of the world when you =
think of the Self. If
you are in a room and close your eyes and do not look=
 out, it is immaterial
whether you close the windows of keep them open. (Th=
e body is the room, the
eyes are the window.) Looking at ajna chakra, etc.,=
 is not necessary in this
method. It may help in keeping the mind from goin=
g out towards external
objects.Concentrate on the Self without which there =
are no chakras. They do
not exist without you. You are all of them. All cen=
tres (chakras) are in the
Heart.

The Heart is not the anahata chakra, whic=
h is in the spinal cord.
Heart is 'I'.
