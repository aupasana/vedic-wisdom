I would like to ask a question on behalf of my friend who is very young and=
 recently married.  She says that as she is very young and not seen the wor=
ld yet she is not ready for renounciation. There are two kinds of spiritual=
 people. One who renounces everything and gives himself to God, other one w=
ho doesn't renounce anything but still wishes to pray God. She believes she=
 is the latter. Based on this can she perform the homam.?Are any changes to=
 be done to the existing manual. 

Thanks and regards,
Priya
