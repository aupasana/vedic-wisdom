>From my observation, here in the US:

1. Use dry coconuts =
(available at indian stores). It produces less smoke.
Wood produces more sm=
oke and is suitable for open spaces. You can also cow
dung cakes.
2. For ca=
rpet or wooden floors, use a base for the homa kundam. I bought a
stone til=
e from Home Depot.
3. Use a copper homa kundam with small opening/s on the =
base. Again this is
available at indian grocery stores or you can but them =
online.
4. A long wooden or copper spoon for the ghee will be useful. Again=
 at
indian/fiji stores.
5. It is recommended to use copper rather than alum=
inium or iron kundas.
