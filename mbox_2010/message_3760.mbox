Guruji Pranam,

=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 At first =
I would like to thank all of=A0you who has helped me a lot to gather the in=
formations before doing chandi homam,
=A0
I would like to know like can I d=
o the puja ( with all the puja matra=A0and reading Durga Sapthasati)=A0of A=
ll the God, Ma Durga and then do the homam seperately with only " Om Aim Hr=
im Klim Chamundai Vijay".
=A0
The reason behind is that my place of putting=
 the Idol is on a little bit upper platform and while doing homam it may be=
 a bit difficult to offer all services to both Agni and Devi Photo.
=A0
Tha=
nks & Regards

Shreya.
