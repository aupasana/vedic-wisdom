Namaste

I was did a tarpana some days ago, and while I was doing it
it app=
eared to me that there is tarpana mantra for all different relations. What =
about a specific way to do tarpana to babies that
are born dead or die imme=
diately, or many times couples abort babies
or it happens naturally.

I bel=
ieve there should be a way to do tarpana for the above case.

Does anyone e=
lse have thought about this. If These mantra is already
in the tarapana man=
ual, pardon my ignorance.
How does one do tarpana to these sitautions which=
 may happen in one's kula in any life time.

Best Regards
Mitesh
