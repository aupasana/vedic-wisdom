 K.R.K. Murthy writes in Arunachala's Ramana, Boundless Ocean of Grace,
Vol=
ume 6:

1. Once there was a discussion about the foodstuffs such as onions,=

drumsticks, carrots etc., which orthodox people avoid.Bhagavan Ramana
rema=
rked that they may do good to the body but not to the mind. They may
purify=
 the blood and benefit the body but they rouse passions and are not
helpful=
 for the purification of the mind, chiddasuddhi.

2.Giving up certain fruit=
s, nuts or other foodstuff dear to one,during the
pilgrimages to holy place=
s like Kasi, is one of the practices prevalent
among the religious people. =
One day Bhagavan noticed a devotee avoiding a
mango on this ground and comm=
ented that a better form of 'tyaga' -
renunciation would be to accept whate=
ver one happens to get and not to crave
for which that is not available.

3=
. Once Bhagavan Ramana also told that one may avoid things that do not
agre=
e with one's constitution and take necessary quantities of suitable ones
th=
at do him good. But maintenance of body and health should not occupy much
a=
ttention as it is not our chief pursuit in life.

4. Bhagavan never used to=
 compromise with equality in serving meals.He never
agreed to accept anythi=
ng which is not equally shared by His fellow
diners.He was satisfied only w=
hen He was served in the end, after everyone
was served.Even under exceptio=
nal situations, He was not willing to take the
food of superior quality unl=
ess it was distributed to all.

5. Bhagavan made people of different tongue=
s in South India quite at home by
speaking or writing in their respective l=
anguages.It requires a great effort
to cross the narrow linguistic barriers=
 and shed the unjustifable prejudices
against other languages and appreciat=
e good works in them. Only one who
studies one or two languages in addition=
 to his mother tongue and moves and
lives with others has ample opportuniti=
es of broadening his outlook and also
reaching others' hearts.The initial l=
inguistic affinities do not last long
and after all, people of the same men=
tality flock togetherm whatever their
mother tonuge is.Bhagavan Ramana is p=
articularly adored because He had taken
a lot of pains to master several la=
nguages and write His works in the same
for the benefit of devotees from va=
rious parts.His glorious example will
continue to influence generations of =
devotees to put forth their best
efforts in this direction and to come clos=
er by understanding one another
better.
