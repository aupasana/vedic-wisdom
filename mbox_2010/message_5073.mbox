Namaste,
 
I will give my 2 cents of free-wheeling comments in this area.
 =

*        *        *
 
Rules may have exceptions, but they are meant for ge=
neral guidance.
 
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and his disciples such as Swami A=
dbhutananda, Swami Vivekananda etc ate fish and yet achieved samadhi of var=
ious types. However, we cannot compare ourselves with special beings and we=
 should follow rules and austerities laid out in tradition. Tendulkar may s=
core a century with a terrible backache, but we should not walk out to bat =
with a backache and should try to be healthy. After all, we may not be able=
 to score runs well even when in perfect health!
 
*        *        *
 
By=
 the way, it must be realized that external rules are only meant as a *cata=
lyst* in enabling internal transformation. The goal of all sadhana - medita=
tion, japam, homam, bhajan, service to others etc - is internal transformat=
ion. If the internal attitude is not getting refined, sadhana is yet to wor=
k.
 
*        *        *
 
If a room has a window outside of which there is=
 heavy wind that is constantly blowing a lot of dirt into the room, sweepin=
g the room with a broom does not eliminate dirt. First close the window or =
stop the wind. Similarly, praanaayaama is not enough to purify the nadis an=
d give mental purity, if mind (room) is attached to the objects perceived b=
y senses (window).
 
*        *        *
 
If one reads scriptures and teac=
hings of saints, contemplates on them, constantly analyzes inner motives be=
hind various actions by oneself and tries to change one's own thinking slow=
ly, this process of contemplation and introspection will augment one's exte=
rnal sadhana (such as meditation, japam, homam, bhajan, service etc) and pu=
rifies one faster.
 
*        *        *
 
By the way, it is useless to thi=
nk in terms of Kundalini, awakening Kundalini and raising Kundalini. Such t=
houghts are almost guaranteed to either block Kundalini from rising or from=
 reaching the highest it can.
 
Kundalini shakti is essentially a symbol of=
 one's own self-awareness. Though one is the infinite Self (Purusha), one i=
s "aware" of a limited object in the field of duality (Shakti) springing in=
 Self as "self". That is why Kundalini shakti is worshipped as a form of th=
e divine Mother (Shakti). This self-awareness is normally "sleeping", i.e. =
one assumes that one is so and so person and so and so body without questio=
ning "who am I". That is why Kundalini is portrayed as sleeping in Mooladha=
ra chakra (bhuloka or physical realm). As Kundalini awakens and rises to ot=
her chakras (other lokas or realms of awareness), one's understanding of wh=
o one is gets refined. When Kundalini reaches sahasrara, one is aware of tr=
ue Self.
 
If one thinks "I am this body. There is a Kundalini shakti at so=
 and so point in this body. It should now rise to so and so point in this b=
ody", it will focus and limit one's self-awareness to the *physical body* a=
nd hence one's Kundalini will remain in moolaadhaara! For Kundalini to trul=
y rise, one needs to completely forget about the physical body and stop thi=
nking in terms of it.
 
By the way, *very few* people actually experience K=
undalini in higher chakras, though many talk about it. Kundalini is in Mool=
aadhaara chakra or atmost Swadhishthana chakra in most yogis, even advanced=
 and awakened ones. When praana vaayu flows in some higher chakras, that to=
o can result in a powerful experience. Some may mistaken it for Kundalini.
=
 
*        *        *
 
If you want a good score in the examination, study =
well. Stop thinking too much about (and anticipating) the examination and f=
ocus on the subject instead. Study, study, study. Similarly, forget about k=
undalini, forget about chakras, forget about the body even. Do sadhana, do =
sadhana and do sadhana. Read scriptures and teachings of great saints. Inst=
ead of looking externally and judging others, observe your own actions and =
thoughts, analyze what is driving them and consciously try to eliminate wro=
ng motives that stem from false ego, adharma and arishadvarga (lust, anger,=
 greed, delusion, wantonness, jealosy), i.e. put to use the knowledge of sc=
riptures and the teachings of saints. Oneday, Kundalini will rise automatic=
ally.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
