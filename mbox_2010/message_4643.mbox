 In 1993, he gave us the following article about his life. Reading it again=

after all these years we realize what a fortunate soul he was, and also ho=
w
fortunate we all were to have moved closely with him for more than 35 yea=
rs.

I WAS BORN into a very orthodox Brahmin family on November 26, 1913, i=
n the
village of Mondakurathur, near Polur, North Arcot District. That was =
also
the birthplace of the Maharshi's renowned devotee, Echammal, who was r=
elated
to me on my mother's side of the family. My father, Brahmasri Krishn=
a
Ganapati, was a great Vedic scholar who taught Krishna Yajur Veda for thi=
rty
years in the local Vedapatasala.

I had my first darshan of Bhagavan Ma=
harshi at Skandashram in 1921 when I
was eight years old. Sri Vasudeva Sast=
ry, one of the earliest devotees of
Bhagavan, took me to see him. Vasudeva =
Sastry was at that time teaching me
Sanskrit in the Patasala of the Arunach=
aleshwara Temple.

Later in 1923, when Bhagavan came down to the present as=
hram, I used to
visit the ashram often and sit in front of the Maharshi. At=
 that time I was
studying in the Municipal High School where Sri T.K.Sundar=
esa Iyer was a
teacher. After completing high school in 1930, I waited two =
years before
joining an engineering college in Madras. During those two int=
ervening years
I was at the ashram almost daily, along with T.K.S. I used t=
o spend time
there even at odd hours of the day or night.

In 1936, after e=
arning a diploma in civil engineering in Madras, I worked
for six months un=
der Sri K.K.Nambiar. K.K.Nambiar, already a staunch devotee
of Bhagavan, ha=
d at that time the good fortune of being posted as the
District Board Engin=
eer right in Tiruvannamalai itself. By Bhagavan's grace,
I was almost const=
antly at the ashram between 1935 and 1945, though I was
employed off and on=
 in various places. I often quit jobs to come to Sri
Ramanasramam and be ne=
ar Sri Maharshi. My attachment to Bhagavan was such
that I could not remain=
 employed continuously until, by Bhagavan's grace,
Sri K.K.Nambiar, who was=
 then the Chief Engineer of the Madras Corporation
in 1945, got me employed=
 by that Corporation. That ended the rolling-stone
phase of my life, as I r=
etained this job until my retirement in January of
1969. Throughout all the=
se years I would never miss an opportunity to come
to Bhagavan's ashram.

O=
n the occasion of my wedding on July 5, 1942, T. N. Venkataraman, now the
[=
late] President of Sri Ramanasramam, came straight to Vellore from
Karaikud=
i to attend the ceremony. The train passed through and stopped at
the Tiruv=
annamalai station, but T.N.V., along with his eight-year-old son,
stayed on=
 the train and came straight to my marriage. When T.N.V.'s father,
Chinnasw=
ami, heard about it he began to scold his son and criticised him for
going =
to Vellore to attend the wedding. Bhagavan overheard this from the Old
Hall=
 and said, "Why is he shouting? Ambi (T.N.V.) has gone to attend his
friend=
's marriage. There is nothing wrong in this."

After I got married I came t=
o the ashram with my new wife and did pranams to
Bhagavan in the Old Hall. =
My wife, Jnanambal, was already deeply devoted to
Bhagavan and had had his =
darshan even as a girl of eight.

That day, after leaving the Old Hall, my =
wife and I went and visitedMajor
Chadwick in his cottage. I had known Chadw=
ick since his arrival in the
ashram in 1935. He congratulated us on our mar=
riage and remarked about the
appropriateness of the bride's name, saying, "=
Jnana you wanted and Jnana you
have gained."

In the earlier days some peop=
le used to sleep in the Old Hall. Once I slept
there near the southern door=
 at the west side of the hall. I did not get up
even after 5 a.m. Bhagavan =
came near me and touched me with his right toe
saying, "Get up. Day has alr=
eady broken." I immediately got up and had the
darshan of Bhagavan. This is=
 called Visvarupa darshanam, the first darshan
of the chosen deity in the m=
orning.

There was Veda Parayana every evening at the hall in the presence =
of
Bhagavan. He would be mostly indrawn at that time. Following the Veda
Pa=
rayana, from 7 to 7:30 p.m., recitations of the Maharshi's works in Tamil,
=
Telugu, Sanskrit, and Malayalam would take place. Devotees like Ramaswami
P=
illai, Kunjuswami, T.K.Sudaresa Iyer and some others used to take part in
i=
t. In the earlier days I was also participating. During Tamil Parayanam I
n=
oticed Bhagavan appeared quite unconcerned with things around him, though
h=
e remained fully attentive to the recitation. He wouldn=E2=80=99t hesitate =
to
correct our pronunciation of the verses, as he was particular to obey al=
l
the rules of prosody. Once I recited incorrectly the last verse in
"Aruna=
chala Pancharatnam" and Bhagavan pointed it out to me, demonstrating
how it=
 should be pronounced. He was satisfied only when I repeated it to him
corr=
ectly.

Another time I was sitting before Bhagavan and Vaidyanathan Stapati=
 was
showing Bhagavan the sculpture he was making of him. The Stapati asked=

Bhagavan for his opinion as to whether it was a good likeness of him.
Bhag=
avan said, "I can't say. Only Natesan knows."

Vaidyanathan Stapati looked =
at me and Bhagavan said, "Not that Natesan, the
barber Natesan." He conside=
red the barber to be the best authority on
artistic representations of his =
body.

After retirement from service I have come back to the ashram to serv=
e the
devotees. The ashram President, Sri T.N.Venkataraman, being a close f=
riend
of mine since 1934, found me very useful to the new devotees since I =
could
function as both a receptionist and an instructor. The president had
=
entrusted me with the accounts of the Mountain Path magazine, etc. I served=

in the office until 1987. I ceased to work in the office due to glaucoma a=
nd
cataract. Again, by the grace of Sri Bhagavan, I was completely cured of=
 my
eye trouble and normal sight has been restored. Since I am getting aged=
, the
ashram president was kind enough to accommodate me as an old resident=

devotee in the ashram.
