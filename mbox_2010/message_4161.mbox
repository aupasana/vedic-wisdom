 Dr. Prakash Adiseshan of Ann Arbor, Michigan has translated the following
=
interesting excerpts from Smt. Kanakammal=E2=80=99s Tamil book, Ninaivil
Ni=
rainthavai.

1. Sri Bhagavan was observing the activity of a child, who was=
 pointing out
that Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s head was clean shaven and so is h=
ers, etc. He talked
about how observant some children are.

This led Sri Bh=
agavan to recall an incident about a little girl who used to
live in Ramana=
 Nagar. She had observed people bringing food and offering it
to Sri Bhagav=
an and then distributing it to the people in the hall. One day
she approach=
ed Sri Bhagavan hesitatingly, and upon asking he found out that
she had wra=
pped a few papads in her dress, having got them from her kitchen
at home. S=
ri Bhagavan and the girl shared the papads. The next day she
repeated the a=
ct by bringing fruits from her garden. After sharing the
fruits with her, H=
e asked her if there was a picture of him in their house.
The girl said tha=
t they had one. Sri Bhagavan asked her to henceforth offer
the food to the =
picture and eat it herself and think that he ate it. (from
Ch. 29)

2. An e=
lderly man walked into the hall and upon seeing him, Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s=

behavior changed: he appeared to behave like an obedient student. The pers=
on
who entered said, =E2=80=9CBhagavan, please clear all my doubts.=E2=80=
=9D

Smiling and looking at a devotee nearby, Sri Bhagavan replied, =E2=80=
=9CDo you know
who this person is? I came away from Madurai unable to answe=
r his questions.
Now he has come all the way here with more questions!=E2=
=80=9D The visitor was Sri
Bhagavan=E2=80=99s Tamil teacher in school. (fro=
m Ch. 17)

3. One day a devotee pointed out to Sri Bhagavan that someone in=
 the hall
was sleeping. The devotee added that he has been watching that pe=
rson sleep
this way for the past few days. Sri Bhagavan looked at the devot=
ee and
said. =E2=80=9CThat person is taking care of the purpose for which h=
e came. How
about you? Why have you come here?=E2=80=9D (from Ch. 19)

4. A=
mong Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s attendants was one Vaikunda Vaasar (another nam=
e for
Vishnu). Once when he was lying down in Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s hall h=
e noticed a
snake near him. He became petrified and hastily approached Bhag=
avan pointing
out the snake. Sri Bhagavan looked at the snake and said with=
 a laugh,
addressing the devotee, =E2=80=9CVaikunda Vaasar, your bed has co=
me looking for you.
Must be a smooth bed,=E2=80=9D referring to Sri Vishnu=
=E2=80=99s lying posture on the snake.
(from Ch. 19)
