Namaste Vinay ji,
 
> Gyani should live like a fool, away from limelight
 
=
Limelight is a problem if it distracts one (and it does distract most). 
 
=
When electricity is turned off, a lamp may go off immediately. But a fan ma=
y continue to turn for a while. A small fan may turn slowly and for a short=
 while, while a bigger fan may turn longer and faster, after electricity is=
 turned off. What a gyani does *after* self-realization varies from one gya=
ni to another.
 
A self-realized Janaka may rule a kingdom, a self-realized=
 Arjuna may fight a battle, a self-realized Vasishtha may become a rajaguru=
, a self-realized Vivekananda may tour the world and teach vedanta, another=
 self-realized yogi may remain hidden in a cave in Himalayas, and another s=
elf-realized yogi may live like a fool begging outside a temple. What a sel=
f-realized person does is dependent on the previous history of that soul an=
d what Nature expects from one. As one's individual Ego and individual Will=
 efface, one becomes an instrument of nature, like a dry leaf floating in t=
he air.
 
*        *        *
 
Though rishis and gods such as Shiva and Vi=
shnu are liberated, their amshas still come down to earth now and then to a=
ffect important changes, in accordance with the will of Nature and Natural =
Order (niyati). They retain their identity till the end of the creation cyc=
le and yet are ever liberated.
 
I am quoting a relevant writeup from messa=
ge 438 of vedic-wisdom yahoogroup titled "Rishis":
 
*        *        *
 
=
All that our senses perceive is Maya (delusion) that is created by the powe=
r of duality. If the veil of delusion is removed, there is no duality and a=
ll is ONE uniform and undivided consciousness, known variously as Aatman or=
 Brahman or Narayana or Sadashiva. This one uniform and undivided conscious=
ness is known as "unmanifested Brahman". The world of duality, where there =
are many different objects, is also actually Brahman only, but Brahman that=
 went through some modification and manifestation. It is known as "manifest=
ed Brahman". Both are Brahman only.
 
Normally, living in the domain of dua=
lity without being deluded by some aspect of duality or the other is near t=
o impossible. Remaining in duality with a perfect understanding of the unde=
rlying oneness of all objects and perceiving all those objects of duality w=
ithout experiencing attraction or repulsion for any single object of dualit=
y is almost impossible. Most spiritual aspirants try to reach the state of =
oneness with unmanifested Brahman - a state in which there is no duality an=
d no objectification - and become absorbed in that state forever. That is t=
he advaitic experience of "nirvikalpa samadhi" and what happens in "moksha"=
.
 
However, maharshis have described higher states. It is possible to be i=
n oneness with manifested Brahman and unmanifested Brahman at the same time=
. It is possible to remain in duality, with the senses perceiving objects o=
f duality, and yet remain in oneness with the underlying oneness (Brahman) =
of all obejcts and not be deluded, i.e. not experience either attraction or=
 repulsion for any object of duality. Mere perception of objects by the sen=
ses is not the problem. The tendency of mind to be find some attractive and=
 find some repulsive is the problem. It is possible to remain in a state wh=
ere there is neither attraction nor repulsion for any object is possible.
 =

Such a state is experienced by very few beings. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, S=
hirdi Sai Baba etc were in this state always. Swami Vivekananda also experi=
enced it.
 
Rishis are beings who are always in a very high state. They are=
 always alert to the maya and yet not stuck in it. They perceive objects of=
 duality and yet are not attracted or repelled by anything. If one overcome=
s attraction and repulsion and yet remains in duality, one can pretty much =
do anything. But because one is neither attracted or repelled by anything, =
it means one has no personal ego and one has no reason to do anything for p=
ersonal ego. Then one becomes an instrument of nature (Prakriti) and implem=
ents the wish of nature through one's actions, which are performed without =
any attachment or personal identification. One who has a personal ego can d=
o limited things. One who has a very very small ego can do great things. On=
e who has no ego can do ANY thing. But such a being does things that are de=
sired by Nature - the natural order of the universe. They can change the co=
urse of history of nations and planets.
 
A rishi in this state may engage =
in various actions of great consequence for the world. Yet, there is no att=
achment with the actions. He is just an unattached instrument of Nature.
 
=
If one gets out of the duality and becomes absorbed in unmanifested Brahman=
 forever, one is not born again. But a rishi who has an equal vision of unm=
anifested and manifested Brahman is for ever mukta (liberated). Thus, he wi=
ll freely interact with duality without any fear or aversion. Amsa of such =
a rishi may even be born again as a separate person, just as a process runn=
ing in a computer may spawn off a separate thread to do some focussed task.=
 Even if the computer process has finished all the initialization and early=
 work, the newly spawned thread has to go through initialization etc again.=
 Similarly, the person born with amsa has to go through the process of over=
coming weaknesses and realizing self all over again. When a Vivekananda is =
born from the amsa of a rishi, he may have to struggle initially and overco=
me the weaknesses and realize self all over again. But he is the amsa of an=
 ever free and liberated being and will find his way again.
 
Thus, a liber=
ated rishi, with the force of his liberated consciousness and with the forc=
e of his reborn amsas, will act as an unattached instrument of Nature perfo=
rming actions of tremendous consequences without any personal ego driving t=
hose actions.
 
BTW, Ramakrishna specifically said six of his disciples wer=
e ever liberated.

> ..spiritual Guru of Swami Ramakrishna Paramhamsa..
 
Vasis=
htha, Viswamitra and Rama were all gyanis. Vasishtha sent Rama with Viswami=
tra. Viswamitra taught Rama the vidyas of Bala, Atibala etc. Rama finally k=
illed Maricha, Subahu etc. Each gyani had an important role to play in the =
drama and none could have played another's role!
 
Same holds to yogis like=
 Trilinga Swami, Bhairavi Brahmani, Tota Puri, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Sar=
ada Mata, Vivekananda, Brahmananada etc. Lucky is one who knows exactly wha=
t one's role in this drama is and plays it without getting entangled in the=
 details of the drama that are unnecessary to one..
