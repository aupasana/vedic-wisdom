Dear S,
=C2=A0
Nice and interesting mail. I have a few points to make in th=
is regard.
=C2=A0
IMHO a sadhaka needs to be an example of how things or pe=
ople could be in this world and provide an inspiration and a counter curren=
t even when things outside seem to be falling to bits.
=C2=A0
This is absol=
utely true. 
=C2=A0
However, certain changes have happened in the world tha=
t we live in, compared to the world that used to be=C2=A0even a 100=C2=A0to=
=C2=A0150 years back. Consider the amount of exposure people have to subtle=
 sexual inneundoes in the form of televisions, average dressing, advertisem=
ents, books, pretty much anything and everything. This was not the case dur=
ing the times when people like Ramakrishna Paramhamsa or Ramana Maharishi l=
ived. This is a clear sign of the Kali Yuga deepening. In such situations, =
even souls who were very advanced sadhakas in past=C2=A0lives=C2=A0would fi=
nd it a very, very difficult task to maintain brahmacharya (brahmacharya is=
 both physical and mental). This is how nature has designed things for this=
 age. Whereas the number of people=C2=A0wearinng the ochre robes and sittin=
g in high pedastals and giving=C2=A0lectures on shastras=C2=A0have increase=
d 5 fold in these last two decades, specially with revolution in communicat=
ion. The essence of the ochre is brahmachrya.
 One who cannot maintain that=
 should never wear that dress. Then why is this discrepency? Because, this =
is Kali Yuga. Please note, I am not saying everyone who wears the dress of =
a sadhu is fake in this age, but many are.=C2=A0In such times nature will d=
ecide to do a balancing act. 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
While it is true that a large p=
art of our lives are karmic reactions, but we do have alot of free will too=
, still. One may get a bad guru due to his past karmas, but what about the =
soul who=C2=A0has become spiritual in this life for the first time, and has=
 no karmic links with any guru anywhere in=C2=A0past lives? Simple probabil=
ity says, such a soul will end up being deluded by a false personality rath=
er than a genuine one in this age.=C2=A0Instead of being a karmic reaction,=
 that act would become the start of a new, complex and bad karmic cycle. An=
d there could be many, many souls=C2=A0like this.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
I believe, a=
nyone or anything, who helps to take a person towards God is a guru. Things=
 need not be personality driven. 
=C2=A0
The reason people this age flock t=
o gurus is because they feel they will get some benefit out of the same. In=
stead if all the people who keep endlessly hunting for gurus, would spend t=
eh same time and energy in doing some sadhana, Nature Herself will guide th=
e individual. Plus this reduces the risk of getting=C2=A0caught with some f=
ake.=C2=A0In past ages, if a person wore the dress of a guru and spoke like=
 a guru and acted like a guru, he was probably a genuine guru. Today, every=
thing can be acting. I know of one specific case where a person posed as gu=
ru of sorts, had excellent communication skills, and=C2=A0could read people=
's minds to some extent. If you were to talk to him, he would probably brin=
g up a topic=C2=A0 or use a word or phrase or say something which you had b=
een thinking about privately. He had some nice abilities. Naturally, 99 per=
cent people who met him would end up getting overawed. Only later did some =
of his disciples find out that he was sexual
 pervert. Thinking of this log=
ically, how would a person distinguish a fake from real in these circumstan=
ces? If you meet a person who speaks amazingly well, has some siddhis, appe=
ars quite=C2=A0knowledgeable, 9 out of 10 people would take such a person a=
s genuine. That is because we have the tendency of juding a spiritual perso=
n based on the externals - all these are externals - instead of how much re=
al change has the person brought in us. BY change, one means detachment fro=
m reactions and provocations of material life. If we put all this down to m=
ere karma and fate, I beg to disagree. That is a fatalistic attitude. There=
 is always some freewill. Not trying is never an option, at least as long a=
s I have not become a real advaita gyani. Instead if one adopts the attitud=
e that one will keep doing sadhana of any deity, there is better chance tha=
t Nature/Deity will take the person to the right places and people to get g=
uided as and wehn needed. The problem with
 this age is, people want short =
cut remedies to problems, instead of doing sadhana themselves, and some non=
 genuine individuals misuse this tendency and fool people. 
=C2=A0
In this =
context, I am reminded of two predictions that Sri Anandamayi Ma had given =
to someone who knew her personally. Anandamayi Ma was considered a self rea=
lized saint, who lives in Kasi died in early 80s. She had said, in the deca=
des to come, there will be 'gurus' who will be like a snakes who eate his o=
wn feces, in other words.
=C2=A0
Second thing she mentioned was an imagery =
of a hill, and from the top of the hill a boulder starts rolling. As it=C2=
=A0rolls down=C2=A0it gain momentum and force and increases in size, and up=
roots many huge and illustrous trees on the hill, one after the other, unti=
ll finally it comes and stops standstill=C2=A0infornt of a very small and f=
rail tree. The big trees are the big names, and the small tree before which=
 the=C2=A0boulder stops=C2=A0is a common man.
=C2=A0
Somehow I feel, these =
two examples have great signification for the decades to come.

Namaste Na=
rasimha,
I have to 'disagree' with you here. The fact is that the uttama Gu=
ru appears to sadhakas of the same stature. In the present times, there is =
a shortage of such people. There are fewer uttama sishya and hence there is=
 a shortage of uttama Gurus. 

Again it is nothing new to say that God must=
 be the Guru. This is how it has been and will be. Like the sastras say - G=
uru, mantra and devatha are one and there should be no difference seen betw=
een them. In the same way, the sastra say that the one who considers the ph=
ysical being his Guru is not destined to succeed. 

Even today if a uttama =
Guru is born, He/She may want to attract only the uttama sishya and not an =
adhama sishya. Unless one is that sishya, one will always see a million def=
ects in ones Guru- EVEN if he is a maha-siddha. The fault is in the viewer.=
 What to say of Guru, one can find fault in Devatha as well. The problem is=
 not with the Guru/Devatha, but with the viewer/sadhaka who is still subjec=
t to his/her own conditioning and the accumulated results of sins acting on=
 him/her. The Guru as well as the Devatha are eternal and our own limited p=
ersonalities are not. The 'dress' the Guru wears ( His/Her own limited pers=
onality which He/She has mostly overcome) is also not permanent. This is wh=
y the tantras say that Guru vakya is often more powerful than the Guru.The =
vakya comes from the Devatha in the form of the Guru. 

The very fact that =
various tantras spend time in explaining Guru lakshanam and sishya lakshana=
m is very revealing about how things have been for the past few 1000 years =
at least.

The Guru as well as the devatha are never external. Our entire s=
adhana lies in realisation of this fact. 

People are led by their own karm=
a to false Gurus. There is little need to look at false Gurus and despair(m=
ay be not you, but as many people are wont to). This is like looking at a b=
ad husband or cheating wife and believing that all husbands or wives are li=
ke that.

There were very clear indications about someone like Nityananda( =
whom I dont condemn for the particular aspect of having been unable to over=
 come his human weakness) being not a fit Guru. 

IMHO a sadhaka needs to b=
e an example of how things or people could be in this world and provide an =
inspiration and a counter current even when things outside seem to be falli=
ng to bits.

My apologies if I have spoken any nonsense or caused any offen=
se.I may have stated the obvious in many different ways or alluded to thing=
s without addressing them. I do not say 'dont do any sadhana and keep searc=
hing for a Guru for ever'; but I do not agree with giving up without search=
ing. I am sure anyone with a good Guru will understand what I say. All corr=
ect things are Her grace and all nonsense that of my limited ago.

guru, surrendered to him/her and followed his/her commands blindly, your li=
fe would be made and you would achieve whatever was meant to be achieved sp=
iritually in that life. However, the same cannot be said about following a =
fake guru blindly. In an age when there are probably going to be far more f=

piritual journey? Instead of searching for a sadguru and surrendering to hi=

ge has the person brought in us. BY change, one means detachment from react=
ions and provocations of material life. If we put all this down to mere kar=
ma and fate, I beg to disagree. That is a fatalistic attitude. There is alw=
ays some freewill. Not trying is never an option, at least as long as I hav=
e not become a real advaita gyani. Instead if one adopts the attitude that =
one will keep doing sadhana of any deity, there is better chance that Natur=
e/Deity will take the person to the right places and people to get guided a=
s and wehn
 needed. The problem with this age is, people want short cut rem=
edies to problems, instead of doing sadhana themselves, and some non genuin=
e individuals misuse this tendency and fool people. </DIV>

<DIV>In this context, I am reminded of two predictions that Sri Anandamay=
i Ma had given to someone who knew her personally. Anandamayi Ma was consid=
ered a self realized saint, who lives in Kasi died in early 80s. She had sa=
id, in the decades to come, there will be 'gurus' who will be like a snakes=
 who eate his own feces, in other words.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Secon=
d thing she mentioned was an imagery of a hill, and from the top of the hil=
l a boulder starts rolling. As it rolls down it gain momentum and=
 force and increases in size, and uproots many huge and illustrous trees on=
 the hill, one after the other, untill finally it comes and stops standstil=
l infornt of a very small and frail tree. The big trees are the big na=
mes, and the small tree before which the boulder stops is a commo=
n man.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Somehow I feel, these two examples have=
 great signification for the decades to come.</DIV>

<DIV><BR>Namaste Narasimha,<BR>I have to=
 'disagree' with you here. The fact is that the uttama Guru appears to sadh=
akas of the same stature. In the present times, there is a shortage of such=
 people. There are fewer uttama sishya and hence there is a shortage of utt=
ama Gurus. <BR><BR>Again it is nothing new to say that God must be the Guru=
. This is how it has been and will be. Like the sastras say - Guru, mantra =
and devatha are one and there should be no difference seen between them. In=
 the same way, the sastra say that the one who considers the physical being=
 his Guru is not destined to succeed. <BR><BR>Even today if a uttama Guru i=
s born, He/She may want to attract only the uttama sishya and not an adhama=
 sishya. Unless one is that sishya, one will always see a million defects i=
n ones Guru- EVEN if he is a maha-siddha. The fault is in the viewer. What =
to say of Guru, one can find fault in Devatha as well. The problem is not w=
ith the Guru/Devatha, but
 with the viewer/sadhaka who is still subject to =
his/her own conditioning and the accumulated results of sins acting on him/=
her. The Guru as well as the Devatha are eternal and our own limited person=
alities are not. The 'dress' the Guru wears ( His/Her own limited personali=
ty which He/She has mostly overcome) is also not permanent. This is why the=
 tantras say that Guru vakya is often more powerful than the Guru.The vakya=
 comes from the Devatha in the form of the Guru. <BR><BR>The very fact that=
 various tantras spend time in explaining Guru lakshanam and sishya lakshan=
am is very revealing about how things have been for the past few 1000 years=
 at least.<BR><BR>The Guru as well as the devatha are never external. Our e=
ntire sadhana lies in realisation of this fact. <BR><BR>People are led by t=
heir own karma to false Gurus. There is little need to look at false Gurus =
and despair(may be not you, but as many people are wont to). This is like l=
ooking at a bad
 husband or cheating wife and believing that all husbands o=
r wives are like that.<BR><BR>There were very clear indications about someo=
ne like Nityananda( whom I dont condemn for the particular aspect of having=
 been unable to over come his human weakness) being not a fit Guru. <BR><BR=
>IMHO a sadhaka needs to be an example of how things or people could be in =
this world and provide an inspiration and a counter current even when thing=
s outside seem to be falling to bits.<BR><BR>My apologies if I have spoken =
any nonsense or caused any offense.I may have stated the obvious in many di=
fferent ways or alluded to things without addressing them. I do not say 'do=
nt do any sadhana and keep searching for a Guru for ever'; but I do not agr=
ee with giving up without searching. I am sure anyone with a good Guru will=
 understand what I say. All correct things are Her grace and all nonsense t=

 wanted t=

ot find anyone like that.<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> We indeed=
 had spiritual masters in the past who were capable of lifting people just =
like that. However, such masters are rare today. In fact, Paramahansa Yogan=
anda said that great masters will no longer descend to earth in coming year=
s. I interpret what he said slightly differently. Some great masters may st=
ill descend to earth in future, but they may not act like the sadgurus of p=
ast. They may only show the (a) path and leave responsibility in the hands =
of people.<BR>> <BR>> Why should it be so?<BR>> <BR>> The age o=
f fake swamis and babas who are secretly after name and money has dawned (o=
r will soon dawn) on earth. They will pretend to be realized masters though=
 they are not. They will be difficult to discern. This is going to render f=
utile for many the search for a sadguru to whom one can
 completely surrend=
er. In the old days, if you found a sadguru, surrendered to him/her and fol=
lowed his/her commands blindly, your life would be made and you would achie=
ve whatever was meant to be achieved spiritually in that life. However, the=
 same cannot be said about following a fake guru blindly. In an age when th=
ere are probably going to be far more fake gurus than sadgurus, isn't it ad=
visable to rewrite the blueprint of a spiritual journey? Instead of searchi=
ng for a sadguru and surrendering to him, it may be better for most seekers=
 to just do sadhana and take God or Fire as guru as Rajarshi wisely said.<B=
R>> <BR>> The old thinking will slowly be replaced by a new model app=
ropriate for the new times. What Paramahansa Yogananda said is along the sa=
me lines. More developments in future may re-inforce the new approach.<BR>&=
gt; <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> Paramahansa Yogananda said that great m=
asters will not descend to earth in future.
 Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said t=
hat he would be back after about 100 years accompanied by others who accomp=
anied him earlier and that many people would be liberated en masse this tim=
e. How do we reconcile?<BR>> <BR>> Quite possibly, Ramakrishna will n=
ot do any miracles or touch people and grant them liberation just like that=
, but he will probably show them how to find god. He will not take them to =
god himself, but point them to a path that will lead to god. He will probab=
ly inspire many people to do intense sadhana and become liberated.<BR>> =
<BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> In the old days, we had brave kshatriyas wh=
o were very dharmik and unselfish. It made sense to put power completely an=
d unconditionally in their hands. It worked for the benefit of all. As such=
 kshatriyas became rare and world started to be dominated by adharmik and s=
elfish seekers of power, Nature adjusted the course of humanity and most of=
 the world is today based on the
 concept of democracy or switching to it s=

from them. But do not worry about finding a sadguru as given in some script=
