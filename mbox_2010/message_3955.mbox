Namaste Utpal

I respect you for what you are and also the homas and other=
 things that you do daily, I wish I overcame my procratisnation, execuses a=
nd laziness and do daily homams. 

I was just trying to put a different per=
spective, may be I need to put it differently and so here I go.

We get bir=
th because of our past actions, and Almighty God or Shakti
in a natural way=
 gives us an oppurtunity to negotiate our karmas.
Isn't that natural spirit=
uality gifted by God? 

When we get born and have both kinds of needs sansa=
ric and spiritual
Why then only ask for spiritual help only or only do thin=
gs with a perspective of on spirituality. 

Just ask for all help spiritual=
 and non spiritual and let nature take its own course. Both external or int=
ernal, Sansar and Spiritual realm
exist within Lord's Maya.

When one one a=
sks for help only in spiritual realm then there is strong sense of "I" ness=
 or ego. i.e. God I am indifferent to
Sansaric needs just help me on the sp=
iritual front. So indirectly there is more ego involved. I can negotiate an=
d overcome sansaric needs on my own.
As in the end it is the "I" and "Me" n=
eeds to dissolve too.

We are all beggers and we just beg, what comes is a =
gift of God.
We get back exactly what we have in the store for us most of t=
he time.

This is my take on "I" and "Me", I can be wrong too.

Best Regard=
s
Mitesh
