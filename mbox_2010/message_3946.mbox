Dear Mitesh,
=C2=A0

I find it little cultish to just refer him all the tim=
e in the group. Spirituaity is atleast not a narrow cult.
=C2=A0
Actually t=
he spirtual people whose name comes up most often=C2=A0in this forum are Ra=
markishna, Vivekananda, Ramana Maharishi. Anyway, it is good to study many =
books but it is not bad to mention one or two saints whom you think have in=
fluenced you most. Let us not get into traps of "political correctness", ab=
out how many times whose name has to be mentioned etc etc. Let everyone be =
finally free to mention or refer to anyone that attracts him or her.
=C2=A0=

The incident you mentioned about Lahiri Mahasaya happened between Lahiri M=
ahasaya and Sri Trilanga Swami. Trilanga Swami saw Lahiri Mahasaya near a m=
arket=C2=A0and bowed to him and said that this man (Lahiri Mahasaya) has at=
tained a state living as a householder=C2=A0for which=C2=A0he (Trilanga Swa=
mi) had to give up even the last cloth on his body.
=C2=A0
I urge all the r=
eaders of this group to read more books from different sects, different sai=
nts and try to get appropriate influence. Get broader and deeper views as t=
hat helps forming a good base for spirituality. Spirtuality is about tolera=
nce and remaining neutral in different situations.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
I had the =
good fortune of reading most of Sri Lahiri Mahasay's diaries, some books of=
 Paramhamsa Yogananda,=C2=A0books of Sri=C2=A0Ramakrishna, Sri=C2=A0Ramana =
Maharishi, parts of Sufi poetry, quite a bit of the actual=C2=A0Koran incld=
uing al-Hadiths,=C2=A0some writings of Shankaracharya,=C2=A0Sri Aurobindo, =
Arthur Avalon, and some excellent collection of spiritual books in Bengali =
about Tantra. But nothing changed me more than the books of Vimalananda. Th=
at is not to say that other books are not good, but for me, personally,=C2=
=A0Vimalanada is the cr=C3=A8me de la cr=C3=A8me of sadhana. I have not com=
e across any other book which answer so many practical queries regarding di=
fferent kinds of sadhana in the simplest of words than Vimalanada's books. =
Again, everyone to his her liking. Obviously, there can be no compulsion in=
 these matters ever. But let people be free to mention and give references =
from anyone whom they feel serves the purpose.
=C2=A0

Namaste

The original question =
from Rajesh was a very good one, and a real one . I compliment him for aski=
ng it and having the courage to ask it.

Lord Shiva in Guru Gita tells to D=
evi Parvati --- "There is no mukti without bukti".

Any good saint I have h=
ad a chance to read or listen or speak to,
never says that "Do Sadhana with=
 spiritual expectations only" In general I mean any type of Sadhana, Japam,=
 Homam, Karma Yoga, Seva, Charitable donation, bhajan,satsang and many othe=
r types.

They always try to increase further the Shraddaha of a sadhak in =
things that captivates a Sadhaka's mind due to his or her state of sanskars=
.

They always try to help the Sadhak walk on the path that leads towards s=
pirituality. They always wish well for their disciples and have good amount=
 of patience.

Many Sadgurus take care of their disciples for many life tim=
es, helping and guiding in each life time.

They always preach many things =
and show value for different types of sadhanas depending on their state, ti=
me, and type of disciple.

For householders always there are challanges and=
 one should request God to look into it and give guidance and help, whether=
 it is food, house, marriage, car, or any material issue. There is nothing =
wrong in doing this, even if sadhana done for materialistic benefits.

Toda=
y even those who have renounced householder life have to pray god to fulfil=
l some of their material needs.

We live in very difficult and challanging =
times and it appears it is going to become more challenging.

Some material=
 gain can at times make a person better or more balanced or be more prepare=
d to do sadhana for spiritual benefits. 

Even during an eclipse many peopl=
e do mantras etc to solve problems or improve material conditions, there is=
 nothing wrong about it. I have read messages in the past on this group sug=
gesting natives not to do it or it is wrong. These type of messages are not=
 correct, it only confuses people. Time during the eclipse is very good for=
 getting results for any sadhana done during that time. it is equally good =
for material or spiritual type.

Everyone has right to have a opinion and s=
hare their views but one needs to also understand the influence aspect of t=
hose views.

Every Shotra or prayer or even Geeta or Ramayan, there are rid=
ers at the end for results like becoming wealthy, overcoming challenges, en=
emies etc.
If it were inappropriate the Seers from the past would not write=
 it.
Are they wrong in writing that?

They write it to motivate people to r=
ead them as one reads more times there is a possibility that may lead to ch=
ange in the person's attitude.

Moving to original set of questions,

Every=
 one is born with accumulated sanskars out of which as a native interacts w=
ith the world some of these accumulated or sanchit sanskars take the form o=
f prarabdh sanskara, these type of sanskars give pleasure, pain and challan=
ges to the native. Sanchit Sanskars are like seeds and Prarabdh sanskars ar=
e like a tree that bears fruit.

All human beings are also born with anothe=
r quality and that is known as will power. They say will power can change d=
estiny ...

When one does sadhana like say Homaam or Japam. Many things hap=
pen
at many levels, at times there is improvement in materialistic situatio=
n, problems get solved or if the problems remain that state of sadhaka beco=
mes such that he or she pays less attention to the problem or attaches less=
 importance to the problem. God or Guru or Shakti shows the sadhaka a path =
to move forward. Sadhana does increase will power and makes one more tolera=
nt and 
Sadhana also help in eliminating the sanchit sanskars, in fact one =
Saint use to say, do your sadhana and your sanchit sanskars will get crushe=
d such that they can never germinate or fruitify into prarabdh sanskars.

S=
o yes doing sadhana can help one overcome many things at different levels a=
nd help one move in the right direction. At times one moves faster or very =
slowly. The important thing is moving and if one falls down, than one shoul=
d immediately get up.

There are many ways to improve and move faster towar=
ds spirtuality,
Vimalanda is not just one saint, there are many who have re=
ached similar or higher or lower realizations adopting different methods an=
d have written very good books too. Sprituality is much bigger, deeper and =
broader than what Vimalanada has described in his books.

I find it little =
cultish to just refer him all the time in the group. Spirituaity is atleast=
 not a narrow cult.

Please note that I have nothing against Him, I respect=
 him as I respect other saints from the bottom of my heart. I did spent mon=
ey to get his books and plan to read in near future.

I urge all the reader=
s of this group to read more books from different sects, different saints a=
nd try to get appropriate influence. Get broader and deeper views as that h=
elps forming a good base for spirituality. Spirtuality is about tolerance a=
nd remaining neutral in different situations.

The Nath Sampradaya, Shiviat=
es from Kashmir, the lineage of Ramananda,
Datta Sampradaya, the sufis, eve=
n some christain saints (The book of Mirdad) and many more sects some of th=
e Lhamas of Buddhism had very deeper realizations and experiance. There are=
 many sects in south india too, kerala, tamil nadu, andhra pradhesh, mahara=
stra,rajastha n, gujarat and other states, all of them had great saints.

G=
enerally these saints never bothered to write or explain or were not able t=
o explain. But some did write and a lot of good work is out there to explor=
e along with doing sadhana.

We live in times where there is very little gu=
idance available on the path of spirituality. So in these times we have to =
make up with reading good books written by saints of yestaryers and surrend=
er more to god.

There is scarcity of Sadgurus and good Sadhaks, we have ma=
ny entry level and confused situation :-) ....

If you look at sikhism, the=
 last sadguru dev from their sect made the book "granth saheb" as the guru =
instead of making anyone else take his seat.

When Lahiri Mahashaya met a f=
amoius saint of kashi, he got lot of respect from him. Some of the famous s=
aint's disciple were upset,
at that the saint reminds them that to reach hi=
s own spiritual state he took 400 or so years but Lahiri Mahashaya did it i=
n one birth.
His name slips my tongue, he was big and very strong lived in =
water many hours at a time, his name starts with tri. They say that one is =
not able to stare at the eyes of the statue of the saint at his samadhi man=
dir.

One must always try to broaden ones perspective, all of us have a lon=
g long way to go, even if some may feel that oh I only have some more thing=
s left so I may be done in some years, even that is an interesting situatio=
n as there is always a chance of falling down.

Even for Saint Bharathari o=
ne of the nav naths, he was so elevated but he also had some sanskars that =
forced him to take birth and enjoy first and than suffer due to pingala. He=
 was already realized before his birth as the rajah.

I did not intend to o=
ffend anyone or thier veiws, If I inadvertantly did it I appologize in adva=
nce, Narashima has written very well many times and of late has written som=
e good stuff.

Best Regards
Mitesh

 times and it appears it is going to become more challenging.<BR><BR>Some m=
aterial gain can at times make a person better or more balanced or be more =
prepared to do sadhana for spiritual benefits. <BR><BR>Even during an eclip=
se many people do mantras etc to solve problems or improve material conditi=
ons, there is nothing wrong about it. I have read messages in the past on t=
his group suggesting natives not to do
 it or it is wrong. These type of me=
ssages are not correct, it only confuses people. Time during the eclipse is=
 very good for getting results for any sadhana done during that time. it is=
 equally good for material or spiritual type.<BR><BR>Everyone has right to =
have a opinion and share their views but one needs to also understand the i=

 or Ramayan, there are riders at the end for results like becoming wealthy,=
 overcoming challenges, enemies etc.<BR>If it were inappropriate the Seers =
from the past would not write it.<BR>Are they wrong in writing that?<BR><BR=

>Moving to original set of questions,<BR><BR>Every one is born with accumul=

 sanskars take the form of prarabdh sanskara, the=
se type of sanskars give pleasure, pain and challanges to the native. Sanch=
it Sanskars are like seeds and Prarabdh sanskars are like a tree that bears=
 fruit.<BR><BR>All human beings are also born with another quality and that=
 is known as will power. They say will power can change destiny ...<BR><BR>=
When one does sadhana like say Homaam or Japam. Many things happen<BR>at ma=
ny levels, at times there is improvement in materialistic situation, proble=
ms get solved or if the problems remain that state of sadhaka becomes such =
that he or she pays less attention to the problem or attaches less importan=
ce to the problem. God or Guru or Shakti shows the sadhaka a path to move f=
orward. Sadhana does increase will power and makes one more tolerant and <B=

use to say, do your sadhana and your sanchit sanskars will get crushed such=
 that they can
 never germinate or fruitify into prarabdh sanskars.<BR><BR>=
So yes doing sadhana can help one overcome many things at different levels =
and help one move in the right direction. At times one moves faster or very=
 slowly. The important thing is moving and if one falls down, than one shou=

eeper and broader than what Vimalanada has described in his books.<BR><BR>I=
 find it little cultish to just refer him all the time in the group. Spirit=
uaity is atleast not a narrow cult.<BR><BR>Please note that I have nothing =
against Him, I respect him as I respect other saints from the bottom of my =
heart. I did spent money to get his books and plan to read in near future.<=
BR><BR>I
 urge all the readers of this group to read more books from differ=
ent sects, different saints and try to get appropriate influence. Get broad=

BR><BR>The Nath Sampradaya, Shiviates from Kashmir, the lineage of Ramanand=
a,<BR>Datta Sampradaya, the sufis, even some christain saints (The book of =
Mirdad) and many more sects some of the Lhamas of Buddhism had very deeper =
realizations and experiance. There are many sects in south india too, keral=
a, tamil nadu, andhra pradhesh, maharastra,rajastha n, gujarat and other st=
ates, all of them had great saints.<BR><BR>Generally these saints never bot=

<BR>We live in times where there is very little guidance available on the
