 Once Bhagavan ramana composed twenty Tamil stanzas containing his importan=
t
teachings. They were not written in any particular order to form a poem. =
Sri
Muruganar therefore suggested that Bhagavan should write twenty stanzas=
 more
to make it the conventional forty. Accordingly, Bhagavan composed twe=
nty
more stanzas. Out of these forty, Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni selected two=
 as
the invocatory stanzas.

Then Bhagavan wrote two more to complete the f=
orty. Some of the stanzas were
translations from Sanskrit, but as devotees =
wanted all the forty verses to
be original they were eliminated and new sta=
nzas composed in their place.

The verses were all arranged in a continuous=
 order to form a poem. Later, a
supplement consisting of a second forty ver=
ses was added. So indifferent to
authorship was Bhagavan that he did not wr=
ite all those supplementary verses
himself. When he came upon a suitable on=
e he used it =E2=80=94 mostly translations
from Sanskrit
=E2=80=94 and when=
 not, he made one. The verses eliminated from the original forty
verses wer=
e included in the supplement.

These eighty verses are the most comprehensi=
ve exposition of the Maharshi=E2=80=99s
teaching. A number of translations =
have been made and commentaries written
on them. They have been published a=
s separate books by the ashram under the
titles Ulladu Narpadu, Sad Vidya a=
nd Truth Revealed. Bhagavan translated
these verses into Telugu prose under=
 the name of Unnadi Nalubadi and into
Malayalam verse under the name of Sad=
darsanam.

Invocation

1. Unless Reality exists, can thought of it arise? S=
ince,devoid of thought,
Reality exists within as Heart, how to know the Rea=
lity we term the Heart?
To know That is merely to be That in the Heart.

2.=
 When those who are in dread of death seek refuge at the feet of the
deathl=
ess, birthless Lord Supreme, their ego and attachments die; and they,
now d=
eathless, think no more of death.

The Text

1. Since we know the world, we=
 must concede for both a common Source, single
but with the power of seemin=
g many.The picture of names and forms, the
onlooker, the screen, the light =
that illumines =E2=80=94 all these are verily He.

2. On three entities =E2=
=80=94 the individual, God and the world =E2=80=94 every creed is
based. Th=
at =E2=80=98the One becomes the three=E2=80=99 and that =E2=80=98always the=
 three are
three=E2=80=99, are said only while the ego lasts. To lose the =
=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 and in the Self
to stay is the State Supreme.

3. =E2=
=80=98The World is true=E2=80=99; =E2=80=98No, it is a false appearance=E2=
=80=99;=E2=80=98The World is Mind=E2=80=99;
=E2=80=98No, it is not=E2=80=99=
; =E2=80=98The World is pleasant=E2=80=99;=E2=80=98No, it is not=E2=80=99 =
=E2=80=94 What avails such
talk? To leave the world alone and know the Self=
, to go beyond all thought
of =E2=80=98One=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98Two=E2=80=
=99, this egoless condition is the common goal of all.

4. If Self has form=
, the world and God likewise have form. If Self is
without form, by whom an=
d how can form (of world and God) be seen? Without
the eye, can there be si=
ght or spectacle? The Self, the real Eye, is
infinite.

5. The body is made=
 up of the five sheaths;in the term body all the five are
included. Without=
 the body the world is not. Has one without the body ever
seen the world?

=
6. The world is made up of the five kinds of sense perceptions and nothing
=
else. And those perceptions are felt as objects by the five senses. Since
t=
hrough the senses the mind alone perceives the world, is the world other
th=
an the mind?

7. Though the world and mind rise and fade together,the world=
 shines by the
light of the mind. The ground whence the world and mind aris=
e, and wherein
they set, that Perfection rises not nor sets but ever shines=
. That is
Reality.

8. Under whatever name or form we worship It, It leads =
us on to knowledge of
the nameless, formless Absolute. Yet,to see one=E2=80=
=99s true Self in the Absolute,
to subside into It and be one with It, this=
 is the true Knowledge of the
Truth.

9. =E2=80=98Twos=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=
=98threes=E2=80=99 depend upon one thing, the ego.If one asks in one=E2=80=
=99s
Heart, =E2=80=98What is this ego?=E2=80=99 and finds it,they slip away=
. Only those who have
found this know the Truth, and they will never be per=
plexed.

10. There is no knowledge without ignorance; and without knowledge=
 ignorance
cannot be. To ask, =E2=80=98Whose is this knowledge? Whose this =
ignorance?=E2=80=99 and thus
to know the
primal Self, this alone is Knowled=
ge.

11. Without knowing the Self that knows, to know all objects is not
kn=
owledge; it is only ignorance. Self, the ground of knowledge and the
non-Se=
lf, being known, both knowledge and ignorance fall away.

12. True Knowledg=
e is being devoid of knowledge as well as ignorance of
objects. Knowledge o=
f objects is not true knowledge. Since the Self shines
self-luminous, with =
nothing else for It to know, with nothing else to know
It, the Self is Know=
ledge. Nescience It is not.

13. The Self that is Awareness, that alone is =
true. The knowledge which is
various is ignorance. And even ignorance,which=
 is false, cannot exist apart
from the Self. False are the many jewels, for=
 apart from gold, which alone
is true, they cannot exist.

14. =E2=80=98You=
=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98he=E2=80=99 =E2=80=94 these appear only when =E2=80=
=98I=E2=80=99 does.But when the nature of
the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 is sought=
 and the ego is destroyed, =E2=80=98you=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98he=E2=80=99 a=
re at an end.
What shines then as
the One alone is the true Self.

15. Past=
 and future are dependent on the present. The past was present in
its time =
and the future will be present too.Ever-present is the present. To
seek to =
know the future and the past, without knowing the truth of time
today, is t=
o try to count without the number =E2=80=98One=E2=80=99.

16. Without us th=
ere is no time nor space. If we are only bodies, we are
caught up in time a=
nd space. But are we bodies? Now, then and always =E2=80=94 here,
now and e=
verywhere =E2=80=94 we are the same. We exist, timeless and spaceless we.
