Biswajit,

God bless you!

Dakshineswar is a wonderful place. Do plan to me=
ditate in the temple premises.

You can take water from Hugli and do abhish=
ekam to mutiple shiv lingams in the temple.

There is a room with large por=
trait of Ramakrishna Pramahamsa. It is really blissful to sit and meditate.=


The main Kali shrine is a little crowded, and you won't be able to sit an=
d meditate there, but, you can sit in front of the shrine (from one of the =
shiv shrines there) and meditate. Alternatively there is a krishna shrine b=
efore the Kali shrine. You can sit in front of the krishna idol and meditat=
e for as long as you want.

If you get time, do visit Belur math.

Best reg=
ards,
Vijay
