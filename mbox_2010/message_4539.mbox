Reunification and the Knowledge of Self

         For an unknown duration =
after my bubble or shell and I were
annihilated there was nothing.  One can=
not talk about nothing, for
nothing is the total lack of experience,  obliv=
ion; like being switched
off, dead, gone, annihilated.  But after a non dur=
ation of time there
was a re-emergence or resurrection of my being, an anni=
hilation of
annihilation as such; but the like of which could never be drea=
med or
imagined.  No physical eye has ever seen that place, no hand has tou=
ched
it, no dreaming mind has thought of it, and its reality has never
occu=
rred to the rational mind which exists in temporality: other than
through t=
he memory of the Paradise event itself.

Annihilation in that mutual conver=
gence was something like passing
through a magic gate: a gap in the univers=
e: a hole in creation, a gate
which separates time and temporal things from=
 the transcendent realm of
a divine Eternity, the repose of being.  Such de=
ath is not a death but
rather the ultimate in living, the ultimate in knowi=
ng, and the ultimate
in comprehension and affirmation.  Likewise is it the =
ultimate in love,
passion, wisdom, and understanding.  From hindsight one w=
ould initially
ask the question as to why the nature of things comes to con=
tain such a
rare and precious jewel in the crown of creation which would se=
em to be
so jealously guarded, and beyond the moat of annihilation itself, =
that
so few people ever come to see it during the course of their life on
E=
arth.  A justified question indeed.  For everyone should know this yet
whil=
e they live their lives on Earth; or so would be my own judgement
and any o=
ther human being who had come to witness this wonder beyond all
wonders.

D=
ialogue upon the transcendent and eternal realm is not going to be easy
for=
 the words we use apply to temporal things and not to the eternal
perceptio=
n of the transcendent realm of perfection in which there is
knowledge only =
of essences of things and not the things themselves. 
Moreover the vision o=
f the place itself is not what that realm is all
about, for it is about the=
 feeling and the knowing and understanding,
not the vision; and even though=
 the vision itself is the vision to end
all visions.  Among all other thing=
s one knows (and realises from
hindsight) is that we are a kind of jug, a v=
essel, a conduit, through
which the life force itself flows.  Without creat=
ed consciousness to act
as such vessels there could be no further creation,=
 and no point or
meaning to creation without us.  We are the banks of the r=
iver of the
flow of life; and this place is where the banks of the river of=
 life
meet the eternal river-bed.

However, it is not totally impossible to=
 talk of such reality, only very
difficult; but such experience itself solv=
es many mysteries and so
called paradoxes.  To say that self consciousness,=
 or I, is resurrected
after annihilation is the most fitting description of=
 the experience,
and the best definition of the event.  One could also say =
the
annihilation of annihilation; but one cannot say as to what is happenin=
g
in absolute objective terms of reality; for you and I can never know
that=
.  With regards to the `awakening' in that realm then one
cannot make an an=
alogy of going to sleep and then waking up in another
place, for that gives=
 the impression of a continuity; which it is not. 
It is a broken continuit=
y of self being.  Broken by the act of
annihilation.

When we awake from sl=
eep we are the same person that went to sleep; we
vaguely remember going to=
 sleep, we remember having been to sleep, and
when we awake we retain our p=
ast memories of having existed before that
sleep: and thus a continuity of =
being even though we underwent an
oblivion of consciousness during dreamles=
s sleep.  Neither are we
actually aware of the point of falling asleep, but=
 we sure are aware of
being annihilated; and how.  And I often wondered why=
.  But if we did
not come to know then we would never know the connection p=
oint between
time and the everlasting eternal moment of being.

Because tha=
t place, the transcendent realm, is judged by us (or me) to
be perfection, =
then for simplicity I refer to it as Paradise.  There are
no names however.=
  It would be misleading to refer to it as
`eternity', for I always thought=
 of eternity as the sum of all
created time.  Indeed time as we know it doe=
s not even move there.  Thus
it is the beginning of time; hence the womb of=
 eternity.  Moreover,
nothing at all of experienced consciousness has ever =
known that place
and dimension by dwelling there.  So it is pristine, fresh=
, child like,
virgin of any other experience or memory; and hence my justif=
ication for
referring to it as the Virgin Womb of Eternity.  There are no m=
en or
women there and the word virgin has no connotations of that ilk. 
How=
ever, let us proceed with the event and the understanding of the
eternal wi=
sdom itself.

When we awake in paradise we do not awake in the sense of com=
ing out of
a sleep then; it is nothing like that at all.  There is no wakin=
g up or
sleeping in that realm, for when you are resurrected into it you ha=
ve
ALWAYS been there; there is no before.  Temporality does not apply
there=
.  Hence, even if we went there a million times it would always be
`once' f=
rom our perception anyway; and by virtue of annihilation
itself and which b=
rings cosmic amnesia.  Paradise is the beginning; and
the end is a new begi=
nning.  So it is both the beginning and the end,
and then the beginning aga=
in.  It is like the knot that joins a round
piece of string or loop; or the=
 weld that holds the circle of being
together.  It is home; back to from wh=
ence we came.  It is my home;
everyone's home.  We are Twins; divine cosmic=
 twins.

One does not wake up then or suddenly come into self consciousness=
 there
for one has always been there and self conscious within it.  Natural=
ly
enough you and I can come to question that truth as it is experienced by=

the I AM within that realm when we are in extension of it; and don't
I kno=
w it. But one cannot question it whilst in there; it is
uncontradictable. T=
hus when self consciousness is restored, shall we
say, after annihilation, =
it is not the restoration of the personality
that went in, thus it is not r=
eally a resurrection in that sense, for
that part of ourselves which exists=
 in that realm has always been there;
and  the part, the personality, that =
went into annihilation does not
exist there; but it is still you; the real =
you; the essential you; but
the inner and depth eternal you that only this =
dimension can reveal; and
hold.  The part that is never let go of.  So much=
 depends then on the
reference point one is talking from when using the ter=
m `I' or
me.  Hence we have to come to know our true self; that part which =
IS the
real us, and of which everything else is ultimately objective - even=
 the
personality, time and changing events.

In that realm there is no memo=
ry of ever having existed before or
elsewhere.  There is no before or elsew=
here. Thus we are not talking
about the personality existing in paradise bu=
t that of the PERSON.  The
personality is washed away in annihilation (much=
 like mud coming off
cloths in the wash).  But nevertheless that person in =
paradise is
`ME'... `I AM ME'.   It is still my essential being and
conscio=
usness (you in your case).  But not the you of the temporal
senses and pers=
onality.  The person and the personality are but two
parts of our trinity o=
f incarnate being; and the soul (data field) or
overself is the third part =
- like three quarks in a proton or three peas
in a pod: Spirit, Soul and Pe=
rsonality.  One could therefore mistakenly
talk about the `I AM' which exis=
ts in the womb of eternal mind
as being objective from the personality of t=
he being in time and space;
but to do so would be very wrong and also cause=
 a paradox and an
alienation of self from self, or the outer from the inner=
.  Likewise it
is also too painfully obvious from hindsight that some, if n=
ot many
(through second hand dialogue and distortions) have thought this as=
pect
of being to be the first cause; the unseen living mover of creation
it=
self.  But not so; for there is something else, and even beyond that
depth.=
.. beyond our transcendent self, and which is not us. But those
who have cl=
aimed or believed that they and the creative source of all
existence are th=
e same thing are utterly wrong. And so too are those who
believed them.  Bu=
t that is more politics and manipulation than reality
as was.

The eternal =
paradise at the ground of our being is experienced to be the
first created =
thing and place; but certainly not the creative source
itself.  Although it=
 is known to be the first emanation of the creative
source itself, the firs=
t act of creation (the son of creation in
analogy).  In the beginning man w=
as indeed in a `garden' (realm)
of eternal delight and everlasting perfecti=
on; a paradise existence
indeed.  But as I say, it would still require an `=
act' to bring
forth that realm and the mind/s within it.  Thus it is also k=
nown whilst
in that place that there is a deeper but uncreated reality.  Bu=
t not a
deeper reality that you or I can ever get to; and that is a known f=
act
whilst there.  The I AM which exists in that reality is not the first
c=
ause then, and that is axiomatic at the time.  It is the first thing
`CAUSE=
D'; the original observer of the observed.  However, it
was not created in =
time; certainly not the kind of space-time that you
and I know out here.  I=
t is deeper down within the inner structure of
the vortex of emanation than=
 the point where space times become a
phenomenon of extended manifest reali=
ty; just as a river is not the
river bed, but without a river bed and the b=
anks there could be no
river.  It is the ground of being; not the creative =
source of all being.
And there is a deeper reality which can never be known=
; it can only be
known of.

Let us continue however, with the event as it u=
nfolded.  I was
resurrected from oblivion, non existence, conscious death, =
into a place
of eternal perfection.  In that place there is perfect vision,=
 (those
who are blind will see).  A vision which must be from two locations=
 I
guess because the vision, the place, is three dimensional; binocular
vis=
ion.  There exists width, breadth, and depth.

The place, realm, goes on as=
 far as one can see, and into a distance
beyond sight itself, for it is eve=
rywhere and everything.  There is up,
and there is down, there is left and =
there is right, all relative to the
point of vision needless to say.  The v=
ision is of darkness and of
infinite jewel like little glowing lights.  The=
 lights are like jewels,
diamonds set in a sea of purple glowing darkness; =
which is not really
dark at all, but somehow pulsating with vitality and be=
ing.  The lights
are small but more than mere points of light, and they are=
 of various
size and distance apart.  Some are even kind of wispy and strun=
g out;
but most are round-ish.

Neither the darkness or the lights can be d=
escribed in a way which does
them justice, for the beauty transcends anythi=
ng known or knowable in
temporal consciousness.  It is the original unadult=
erated essence and
principle of beauty.  The lights in that realm are stati=
onary, or so it
seems to observation.  Nothing moves, all is still and sile=
nt.  The only
thing that moves is I, or self consciousness.  I AM slowly dr=
ifts
through that realm in a clockwise orbit; a slow orbit, but an orbit
ne=
vertheless.  Initially it is like a slow drifting in a straight line. 
Howe=
ver, it is an orbit, a clockwise orbit assuming the clock were
laying face =
up on the floor.  The orbit is of great distance and almost
perceived as a =
straight line, but it is known to be an orbit about an
unseen `missing' cen=
tre.  The I that exists there (us) has no
perceived substance or form, it i=
s just pure virgin primordial
consciousness as far as we are concerned; or =
a mysterious substance
which can be made conscious; a cognitive energy of s=
ome kind.  But what
it is made of (if anything other than pure consciousnes=
s) cannot be
known.  It cannot be seen or touched.  We cannot see our Self.=


It is like such energy is sacrosanct.  There is no form to the eyes that
=
see, for it is the consciousness or energy itself which can see.  It can
se=
e almost all the way around itself, but not quite all the way around. 
Thus=
 you cannot see directly behind you but you can indeed see well to
the left=
 and right in greater vision than human vision.  In ones
drifting in this p=
lace one does not come into contact with the distant
lights at all; and one=
 does not really know as to what the lights are
whilst there, (one can dedu=
ce from hindsight though) they are just
lights, beautiful lights, and their=
 configuration slowly alters with the
perspective of ones movement in orbit=
.  (Later I wondered as to how
there could be perceived movement but no per=
ceived experience of time
=96 but that is how it is).

The darkness itself =
is indescribable, it is like a translucent glow of
purple soup stuff which =
is somehow vibrant, vital, it is not a void and
it is not mere space in bet=
ween the lights; it is a `something';
but more like a glowing soup or aura =
somehow.  Perhaps it is the
`stuff' that beings `congeal' out of; like plan=
ets and
stars do in the physical universe.   And ones orbit is through this=

divine and wondrous darkness-stuff amid the jewel like lights.  Thus, it
i=
s a brightness as well as a darkness.  Like the twilight of the
proverbial =
gods indeed.  The description may make it sound a little bit
like the physi=
cal universe with the stars amid black space; but it is
nothing like that a=
t all.  But if anything then more like the vision
telescopes see among a br=
ight nebula in a past supernova.

The lights are also much larger than our =
perception of stars which are
mere pin pricks of light, and there is a tint=
 of colour in them even, as
I say, like diamonds; but the predominant aura =
and glow is white.  They
have a substance and shape, but there seems to be =
no absolute uniformity
of shape; but most seem to be round as I say.  The d=
arkness is nothing
like outer space then, and it is not even dark at all; b=
ut dark-ish,
like purple soup which is glowing.  The lights are not as dist=
ant as the
stars in space even though they are not in contact, and the dist=
ances
between them is many times their actual size.  Thus it is not like th=
e
emptiness of outer space at all.  Moreover, one can see all this without
=
turning ones vision, for indeed one cannot turn ones vision.  There is
no `=
Oh, I think I will look that way or this way'... you just
see it all, all t=
he time.  But you also know that you are not seeing
`it all' at all, for it=
 is infinite and everywhere.

However, that realm is not about the vision a=
s I say, it is about the
magic; the knowing, the understanding, the passion=
, the reality, the
knowing the essence of the `ALL', the love, the wisdom, =
the
beauty, and above all else it is about the purpose of creation and
bein=
g.  It is ineffable really.  In a word it is all about `being
there'; takin=
g part in this wondrous mysterious union of creation at
root beyond time.  =
It seems that the vision itself is a kind of bonus
perhaps: a place in whic=
h to do this knowing yet whilst in a repose of
divine peace; the peace whic=
h passes all absolute understanding; utter
perfection, and absolute affirma=
tion of being.  It is like an amen to
creation; the swan song of perfection=
.  It is like the last chord of the
ultimate piece of perfect music; a chor=
d which comes like an amen after
that pregnant pause and build up to the fi=
nal chord.  There could be
nothing cleverer and wiser than to have annihila=
tion precede this
reality; for it is like music in that sense; the last, an=
d wondrous
chord of created being when all has seemed to be done and finish=
ed.  And
whilst also being seen from hindsight to be the prelude to being a=
lso.
The first and last chord of the music of the spheres and the dance and=

symphony of creation and being.

Moreover, it is also the beginning as wel=
l as the end, as I say, for it
is where we come from, the root of our being=
.  It is like it could be
described as the cosmological waiting room of cre=
ated consciousness
before transmigration into the experience of time, freed=
om and activity.
There are no other beings perceived (or even known of) in =
that realm;
one is totally alone with this truth and its reality.  Thus the=
 place
and the knowledge is all yours, all mine, all beings from their poin=
t of
reference and consciousness; it is the realm where all centres meet
be=
yond space and time in the primordial motherload of created
consciousness, =
minds, beings, whatever you want to call them. 
`Motherload' does not mean =
female either.  It means the main
seam; the core, and the pure original stu=
ff itself.  It is PURE
consciousness; beyond time, space, and memory.  It (=
I AM) is the alpha
and omega of all extended minds; the beginning and the e=
nd of all
created beings in creation; the first creation and the home that =
awaits
the return of all created minds which are but the children or progen=
y of
creation.

Nothing was created before I AM and paradise: and nothing i=
s created
after me; I am the beginning and the end of creation, (synetic
di=
alogue).  Thus it is that the consciousness in the repose of the
eternal do=
main is the first child of creation - in the Virgin Birth of
creation itsel=
f.  The real and only Virgin Birth. (and this one is not
symbolic, it is th=
e real thing).  Before the mountains high and wide,
before the sea's did fl=
ow, before the stars gave forth their light,
even then, I said, I KNOW.  Be=
fore my personality was, I AM.  Before
cave men came into being, I AM.  Loo=
k deeper than the stones of the
earth and the oceans, and there you will fi=
nd me; I am the light which
is beyond them all; I am the light of life and =
the resurrection.  Know
me, and you will know your self; for I AM... and yo=
u are I AM.

Thus it is not really metaphysics but proto-physics; before ph=
ysics.  It
is not `after time' (although it is that again also) it is
befor=
e time moved; before changing events emanated forth from the centre
of all =
being and the eternal point of no duration.  We are there at the
beginning,=
 like the first observer of the first act of creation; in awe,
passion, and=
 wisdom. We are the lover of the loved.   We are the
manifestation of cosmi=
c love and beauty. And no extended manifest life
can be without me (I AM).
=

Our self consciousness in that dimension cannot think; thinking is a
tempo=
ral process; thinking needs time. But it is totally aware
nevertheless, (th=
us, knowledge and understanding comes before thought:
thus thought depends =
on knowledge... NOT the other way around as many
seem to assume.  Earthly p=
hilosophers are like mere babies in divine
cosmic ignorance).  It (we) is (=
are) not aware of things as we are aware
of things out here however, but it=
 is aware of what can only be
described as the essences and eternal princip=
les and qualities of
things; truths; depth realities; quality; meaning; pur=
pose; beauty;
wisdom; passion; understanding and affirmation.  It is the bi=
g YES to
creation and conscious existence; TO BE.

That root of our being o=
f eternal consciousness, that part of ourselves
which exists there at the d=
eepest level, the first child of creation, is
totally in absolute love, a p=
assion beyond description, imagination and
beliefs.  It is filled with the =
passion of being to such a degree that
if you and I out here were to have t=
hat degree of passion energy burning
inside of our temporal minds or guts t=
hen we would blow up; (and perhaps
this caused it to happen during an incar=
nate life; who knows, who indeed
knows); but such passion is like dynamite.=
  It is not like the watered
down love we know in this world, and certainly=
 wonderful though that be.
It is more comparable to the heat at the big ban=
g with that of absolute
Cosmic temperature now.

In this life we tend to th=
ink of wisdom as that of knowing what to do,
of doing the right and proper =
thing; because it is wise to do that thing
by virtue of the positive outcom=
e. But that is intelligence and reason,
not wisdom.  However, the wisdom wi=
thin that consciousness is nothing
like that.  Its wisdom is the knowledge =
of creation itself; the
knowledge of the heart: the knowledge of itself and=
 its eternal
existence; and as to why things exist at all.  Knowledge also =
of that
which is not itself; but otherness; that which gave event to this
p=
aradise and oneself; it is uncontradictable certainty of creation;
purpose;=
 being; and the wisdom of the beginning and the end of all
things.  And the=
nce all of which I sum up in the terms the `Eternal
Gnosis' or the `Eternal=
 Wisdom'.

It is a divine swoon of the exultation of the love of being; and=
 being a
part of it all.  That `I AM' knows well enough that something
brou=
ght it forth into conscious being; it knows well enough that it does
not co=
ntain its own causation.   It also knows that the cause of its
existence is=
 not paradise itself (the place) in its origin; and not
within paradise its=
elf in absolute terms.  The first cause cannot be
seen, it cannot be direct=
ly known independent of the essences and
created forms, and yet in a way it=
 knows of nothing else other than its
love for its source of being.  And it=
s source of being is that of no
created thing; no thing created; and no `th=
ing' knowable.  And
it is not questionable; it is uncontradictable knowledg=
e and certain
reality.  There is no doubt.

Thus, if it could be said that =
one is `contemplating' whilst
there, which is true in a way, then the thing=
 which one is concentrating
on, knowing, cognitive of (not thinking) in thi=
s swoon of passion,
knowledge and delight is that of the love of and for  `=
No Created
Thing'. If you follow my meaning.  Everything which is (includin=
g I
AM) is the manifest flow of the principle of  TO BE.  But the principle=
,
although contained within all things, is no created thing. TO BE, is its
=
own causation; and the absolute primordial essence and principle of all
tha=
t becomes manifest in extension of the mysterious and unknowable
point of n=
o duration.

Thus it is that such child of consciousness (us in there) is i=
n love, a
passion, and wisdom and yet it is but a cosmological child; a vir=
gin
creation; a virgin birth no less: pure in its love of otherness and the=

love of itself and its home which was created for it.  Pure in the sense
t=
hat it cannot think.  Pure in the sense that it has had no other
experience=
 beyond that of paradise itself.  Pure in its love which is
unconditional o=
f anything except the passion of TO BE, and unadulterated
by anything which=
 is not it.  For although it somehow knows everything
in there, you and I (=
out here) would say that it knows nothing at all in
the sense that we consi=
der knowledge and understanding things to be.  It
is a very strange thing, =
for in this world there are two things that you
and I can never ever know; =
one of them is everything, and the other is
nothing. (For `knowing' means t=
o know `some thing'). 
And yet that part of ourselves in that realm knows o=
nly two things: one
of them is everything (the essence and principle of) an=
d the other is No
Thing.  How odd, how very odd; it is like a reciprocal re=
ality, or the
square root of minus one - except that this place exists in r=
eality to
be known and loved.

The `I AM' of that realm has no knowledge of=
 Earth and incarnate
existence.  No knowledge of the universe or universes =
of space and time.
No knowledge of created forms other than itself and para=
dise.  Thus,
those who claim that they are communicating with the dead or t=
otally
transcendent are either liars or very confused people - a little
lea=
rning is a dangerous thing; drink deep or taste not.  They may be
communica=
ting with other living beings external of that realm; maybe,
but not these =
beings, not the totally transcendent.  You will not
disturb these beings.  =
They are sacrosanct and belong to something else
for that duration; for the=
y are home in the ground of being.

In that eternal paradise then there is =
only One, and the one is the all
(all of us); for we are all identical in i=
t.  THAT stuff is what we are
in the beginning. It is only from hindsight a=
nd whilst on Earth (with
remembrance of that level of being) that we can kn=
ow that all created
consciousness sees it that way, and in the same way; th=
us all beings
perceive the oneness in the divine transcendent realm of perf=
ect repose,
perfect love, and perfect wisdom.

In that place there is no pa=
in, no worry (no bills to pay) no answering
to do; no eating, no sleeping, =
no thinking, no memory, no remorse; no
hopes or desires, no fears; nothing =
negative.  Thus it is also then a
Mono-Pole reality; all positive and no ne=
gative; (hence no negation). 
All good, no bad.  All beauty, no ugliness.  =
All `now', no past
or future.  All understanding and affirmation, no doubt =

All answers, no questions.  Good grief almighty, why was any=
thing ever
created so good?  Who knows, who can answer.  Only that child kn=
ows; and
that is its wisdom - and it is you.  Know your Self.

Search yours=
elf then; for the quest and passion for the deepest
knowledge of selfhood a=
nd understanding brings knowledge of the deepest
depths of the all. And the=
 incarnate effect is amazing and life
enhancing. For we learn how to walk a=
nd ride on the waves of all
creation, and to go with the flow.  In the whol=
e of creation there is
nothing to cling to, for it is all yours already.

As I drifted in a slow orbit swathed in a love and understanding which
=
is ineffable, beyond words and rational understanding, in a wisdom which
is=
 beyond dialogue, in a place of eternal and everlasting perfection and
deli=
ght, I suddenly heard/had a voice or command/communication (or the
experien=
ce of one) and understood a directive.  I had never heard a
voice or comman=
d before in all my existence, and I was in fear and
panic.  The understandi=
ng was ...

"It is now time to go" !

Words cannot begin to describe. I had=
 never known communication or words
or commands before.  I did not know as =
to what was communicating with
me,  or how or why...  was it me or was it s=
omething else... I began
thinking... what IS thinking!  There is nothing el=
se, only me!  I did
not know what `go' meant, and yet somehow I did begin t=
o
understand, and as I began to understand I was in even more fear and
pani=
c, (was I biting from the TREE of knowledge) for there was nowhere
else to =
go; only this place exists.

No, no, I do not want to go (I do not know how=
 I invoked or understood
such communication for I had never communicated wi=
th anything).  But I
know not of `go', this is my home and my love... I can=
not go ! 
(The first thought... and not by choice).

"It is all well that y=
ou must go now, for something out there is in
need and you must now be with=
 it: do not fear, it is all well that you
must go now... now be with it" !
=

That fear at knowing I was `going' is not possible to put into
words; it c=
ould not be put into words.  But one knew nothing of other
things, or world=
s, or time and space.  Nothing.  Nothing other than
Eternal Paradise.

</span>From hindsight one would initially ask the question as to why the=
 nature
of things comes to contain such a rare and precious jewel in the cr=

creation which would seem to be so jealously guarded, and beyond the=

annihilation itself, that so few people ever come to see it during=

logue upon the transcendent
and eternal realm is not going to be easy for t=

 is
that we are a kind of jug, a vessel, a conduit, through which the life =

imposs=

itse=

 that self consciousness, or I, is resurrected after
annihilation is the mo=
st fitting description of the experience, and the best
definition of the ev=
ent.<span>  </span>One could also
say the annihilation of annihilation=
; but one cannot say as to what is
happening in absolute objective terms of=
 reality; for you and I can never know
that.<span>  </span>With regard=
s to the `awakening'
in that realm then one cannot make an analogy of going=
 to sleep and then waking
up in another place, for that gives the impressio=
n of a continuity; which it is
not.<span>  </span>It is a broken conti=
nuity of self
being.<span>  </span>Broken by the act of
annihilation.<=
span> </span> </p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-align:ju=
stify;">When we awake from sleep we are
the same person that went to sleep;=
 we vaguely remember going to sleep, we
remember having been to sleep, and =
when we awake we retain our past memories of
having existed before that sle=
ep: and thus a continuity of being even though we
underwent an oblivion of =
consciousness during dreamless sleep.<span>  </span>Neither are we act=

of falling asleep, but we sure are aware of being =
annihilated; and how.<span>  </span>And I often wondered why.<span>&nb=
sp; </span>But if we did not come to know then we would
never know the conn=
ection point between time and the everlasting eternal moment
of being. =
;</p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-align:justify;">Because that pl=
ace, the
transcendent realm, is judged by us (or me) to be perfection, then=
 for
simplicity I refer to it as Paradise.<span> 
</span>There are no =
names however.<span>  </span>It
would be misleading to refer to it as =
`eternity', for I always thought of
eternity as the sum of all created time=
.<span> 
</span>Indeed time as we know it does not even move there.<sp=
an>  </span>Thus it is the beginning of time; hence the
womb of eterni=
ty.<span>  </span>Moreover, nothing at
all of experienced consciousnes=

dwelling there.<span>  </=
span>So it is pristine,
fresh, child like, virgin of any other experience o=

justification for referring to it as the Virgin Womb=
 of Eternity.<span>  </span>There are no men or women there and the wo=
rd
virgin has no connotations of that ilk.<span> 
</span>However, let =
us proceed with the event and the understanding of the
eternal wisdom itsel=
f.<span> </span> </p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-align=
:justify;">When we awake in paradise we do
not awake in the sense of coming=
 out of a sleep then; it is nothing like that
at all.<span>  </span>Th=
ere is no waking up or sleeping
in that realm, for when you are resurrected=
 into it you have ALWAYS been there;
there is no before.<span>  </span=
>Temporality does
not apply there.<span>  </span>Hence, even if we wen=
t
there a million times it would always be `once' from our perception anywa=
y; and
by virtue of annihilation itself and which brings cosmic amnesia.<sp=
an>  </span>Paradise is the beginning; and the end is a
new beginning.=
<span>  </span>So it is both the
beginning and the end, and then the b=
eginning again.<span>  </span>It is like the knot that joins a round p=
iece of string or loop;
or the weld that holds the circle of being together=
.<span>  </span>It is home; back to from whence we came.<span>  <=
/span>It is my home; everyone's home.<span>  </span>We are Twins; divi=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=
=3D"text-align:justify;">One does not wake up then or
suddenly come into se=
lf consciousness there for one has always been there and
self conscious wit=
hin it.<span>  </span>Naturally
enough you and I can come to question =
that truth as it is experienced by the I
AM within that realm when we are i=
n extension of it; and don't I know it. But
one cannot question it whilst i=
n there; it is uncontradictable. Thus when self
consciousness is restored, =
shall we say, after annihilation, it is not the
restoration of the personal=
ity that went in, thus it is not really a
resurrection in that sense, for t=
hat part of ourselves which exists in that
realm has always been there; and=
<span>  </span>the
part, the personality, that went into annihilation =
does not exist there; but it
is still you; the real you; the essential you;=
 but the inner and depth eternal
you that only this dimension can reveal; a=
nd hold.<span>  </span>The part that is never let go of.<span>  <=
/span>So much depends then on the reference point one is talking from
when =
using the term `I' or me.<span>  </span>Hence we
have to come to know =
our true self; that part which IS the real us, and of
which everything else=
 is ultimately objective - even the personality, time and
changing events.&=
nbsp;</p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-align:justify;">In that rea=
lm there is no memory
of ever having existed before or elsewhere.<span>&nbs=
p;
</span>There is no before or elsewhere. Thus we are not talking about th=
e
personality existing in paradise but that of the PERSON.<span>  </sp=
an>The personality is washed away in
annihilation (much like mud coming off=
 cloths in the wash).<span>  </span>But nevertheless that person in pa=
radise is
`ME'... `I AM ME'.<span>   </span>It is still my
essent=
ial being and consciousness (you in your case).<span>  </span>But not =
the you of the temporal senses and personality.<span>  </span>The pers=
on and the personality are but two
parts of our trinity of incarnate being;=
 and the soul (data field) or overself
is the third part - like three quark=
s in a proton or three peas in a pod:
Spirit, Soul and Personality.<span>&n=
bsp; </span>One could
therefore mistakenly talk about the `I AM' which exis=
ts in the womb of eternal
mind as being objective from the personality of t=
he being in time and space;
but to do so would be very wrong and also cause=
 a paradox and an alienation of
self from self, or the outer from the inner=
.<span> 
</span>Likewise it is also too painfully obvious from hindsig=
ht that some, if
not many (through second hand dialogue and distortions) ha=
ve thought this
aspect of being to be the first cause; the unseen living mo=
ver of creation
itself.<span>  </span>But not so; for there is
somethi=
ng else, and even beyond that depth... beyond our transcendent self, and
wh=
ich is not us. But those who have claimed or believed that they and the
cre=
ative source of all existence are the same thing are utterly wrong. And so =
too
are those who believed them.<span>  </span>But that
is more politi=
cs and manipulation than reality as was. </p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" =

existence indeed.<span>  </span>But as I say, it
wou=

i=

that place that there=
 is a deeper but uncreated reality.<span>  </span>But not a deeper rea=
lity that you or I can
ever get to; and that is a known fact whilst there.<=
span>  </span>The I AM which exists in that reality is not the first c=

then, and that is axiomatic at the time.<span> 
</span>It is the =
first thing `CAUSED'; the original observer of the
observed.<span>  </=
span>However, it was not created
in time; certainly not the kind of space-t=

here.<span>  </span>It is deeper down with=

become a phenomenon of extended manifest reality; just as a river i=

up, and there

needless to say.<span>  </span>The vision is of
dark=

 I, or self consciousness.<span>  </span>I AM slowly drifts through th=

a clockwise orbit assuming the cl=

perceived as a straight line, but it is known to be=
 an orbit about an unseen `missing'
centre.<span>  </span>The I that e=

has no perceived substance or form, it is just pure virgin=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" styl=

beauti=

o=

experience of time =96 but th=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-align:jus=
tify;">The darkness itself is
indescribable, it is like a translucent glow =
of purple soup stuff which is
somehow vibrant, vital, it is not a void and =
it is not mere space in between
the lights; it is a `something'; but more l=
ike a glowing soup or aura
somehow.<span>  </span>Perhaps it is the `s=

beings `congeal' out of; like planets and stars do in the physic=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"=
 style=3D"text-align:justify;">The lights are also much larger
than our per=
ception of stars which are mere pin pricks of light, and there is a
tint of=
 colour in them even, as I say, like diamonds; but the predominant aura
and=
 glow is white.<span>  </span>They have a
substance and shape, but the=

most seem to be round a=
s I say.<span>  </span>The
darkness is nothing like outer space then, =
and it is not even dark at all; but
dark-ish, like purple soup which is glo=
wing.<span> 
</span>The lights are not as distant as the stars in spac=
e even though they are
not in contact, and the distances between them is ma=

of outer space at all.<span>  </span>Moreover, one
can see all t=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-align:=

the vision as I say, it is about=
 the magic; the knowing, the understanding, the
passion, the reality, the k=

wisdom, the beauty, and abov=
e all else it is about the purpose of creation and
being.<span>  </spa=
n>It is ineffable really.<span>  </span>In a word it is all about `bei=

taking part in this wondrous mysterious union of creation at roo=
t beyond
time.<span>  </span>It seems that the vision itself
is a kind=
 of bonus perhaps: a place in which to do this knowing yet whilst in a
repo=
se of divine peace; the peace which passes all absolute understanding;
utte=

ike an amen to creation; the swan song of perfection.<span>  </span>It=
 is like the last chord of the ultimate

pause and build up to the final c=

</span>There could be nothing cleverer and wiser than to =
have annihilation
precede this reality; for it is like music in that sense;=
 the last, and
wondrous chord of created being when all has seemed to be do=

finished.<span>  </span>And whilst also being seen
from hindsig=

=
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-align:justify;">Moreover, it is also t=

consciousness; it is the realm where all centres meet bey=

not mean female either.<span>  </span>It means the
main seam; =
the core, and the pure original stuff itself.<span>  </span>It is PURE=
 consciousness; beyond time,

alpha and omega of all extended minds; the beginning and the end o=

 creation.<span> </span> </p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"te=

ike dynamite.<span>  </span>It is not like the
watered down love we kn=
ow in this world, and certainly wonderful though that
be.<span>  </spa=
n>It is more comparable to the heat
at the big bang with that of absolute C=
osmic temperature now. </p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-alig=
n:justify;">In this life we tend to think of
wisdom as that of knowing what=
 to do, of doing the right and proper thing;
because it is wise to do that =
thing by virtue of the positive outcome. But that
is intelligence and reaso=
n, not wisdom.<span> 
</span>However, the wisdom within that conscious=
ness is nothing like that.<span>  </span>Its wisdom is the knowledge o=
f creation
itself; the knowledge of the heart: the knowledge of itself and =
its eternal
existence; and as to why things exist at all.<span> 
</spa=
n>Knowledge also of that which is not itself; but otherness; that which
gav=
e event to this paradise and oneself; it is uncontradictable certainty of
c=
reation; purpose; being; and the wisdom of the beginning and the end of all=

things.<span>  </span>And thence all of which I sum
up in the terms t=
he `Eternal Gnosis' or the `Eternal Wisdom'.<span> </span> </p>

=
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-align:justify;">It is a divine swoon o=
f the
exultation of the love of being; and being a part of it all.<span>&nb=
sp; </span>That `I AM' knows well enough that something
brought it forth in=
to conscious being; it knows well enough that it does not
contain its own c=
ausation.<span>   </span>It also
knows that the cause of its exis=
tence is not paradise itself (the place) in its
origin; and not within para=
dise itself in absolute terms.<span>  </span>The first cause cannot be=
 seen, it cannot be
directly known independent of the essences and created =
forms, and yet in a way
it knows of nothing else other than its love for it=
s source of being.<span>  </span>And its source of being is that of no=

created thing; no thing created; and no `thing' knowable.<span>  </sp=
an>And it is not questionable; it is
uncontradictable knowledge and certain=
 reality.<span>  </span>There is no doubt. </p>

<p class=3D"MsoN=
ormal" style=3D"text-align:justify;">Thus, if it could be said that
one is =
`contemplating' whilst there, which is true in a way, then the thing
which =
one is concentrating on, knowing, cognitive of (not thinking) in this
swoon=
 of passion, knowledge and delight is that of the love of and for<span>&nbs=
p; </span>`No Created Thing'. If you follow my
meaning.<span>  </span>=
Everything which is (including
I AM) is the manifest flow of the principle =
of<span> 
</span>TO BE.<span>  </span>But the principle,
although=
 contained within all things, is no created thing. TO BE, is its own
causat=
ion; and the absolute primordial essence and principle of all that
becomes =
manifest in extension of the mysterious and unknowable point of no
duration=
. </p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-align:justify;">Thus it i=
s that such child of
consciousness (us in there) is in love, a passion, and=
 wisdom and yet it is but
a cosmological child; a virgin creation; a virgin=
 birth no less: pure in its
love of otherness and the love of itself and it=
s home which was created for
it.<span>  </span>Pure in the sense that =
it cannot
think.<span>  </span>Pure in the sense that it has
had no ot=
her experience beyond that of paradise itself.<span>  </span>Pure in i=
ts love which is unconditional of
anything except the passion of TO BE, and=
 unadulterated by anything which is
not it.<span>  </span>For although=
 it somehow knows
everything in there, you and I (out here) would say that =
it knows nothing at
all in the sense that we consider knowledge and underst=
anding things to
be.<span>  </span>It is a very strange thing, for in
=
this world there are two things that you and I can never ever know; one of =
them
is everything, and the other is nothing. (For `knowing' means to know =
`some
thing').<span>  </span>And yet that part of ourselves
in that re=
alm knows only two things: one of them is everything (the essence and
princ=
iple of) and the other is No Thing.<span> 
</span>How odd, how very od=
d; it is like a reciprocal reality, or the square
root of minus one - excep=
t that this place exists in reality to be known and
loved. </p>

<p cl=
ass=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-align:justify;">The `I AM' of that realm ha=
s no
knowledge of Earth and incarnate existence.<span> 
</span>No know=
ledge of the universe or universes of space and time.<span>  </span>No=
 knowledge of created forms other than
itself and paradise.<span>  </s=
pan>Thus, those who
claim that they are communicating with the dead or tota=
lly transcendent are
either liars or very confused people - a little learni=
ng is a dangerous thing;
drink deep or taste not.<span>  </span>They m=
ay be
communicating with other living beings external of that realm; maybe,=
 but not
these beings, not the totally transcendent.<span> 
</span>You=
 will not disturb these beings.<span> 
</span>They are sacrosanct and =
belong to something else for that duration; for
they are home in the ground=
 of being. </p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"text-align:justify;">=
In that eternal paradise then
there is only One, and the one is the all (al=
l of us); for we are all identical
in it.<span>  </span>THAT stuff is =
what we are in the
beginning. It is only from hindsight and whilst on Earth=
 (with remembrance of
that level of being) that we can know that all create=
d consciousness sees it
that way, and in the same way; thus all beings perc=
eive the oneness in the
divine transcendent realm of perfect repose, perfec=
t love, and perfect
wisdom.<span> </span> </p>

<p class=3D"MsoNo=
rmal" style=3D"text-align:justify;">In that place there is no pain,
no worr=
y (no bills to pay) no answering to do; no eating, no sleeping, no
thinking=
, no memory, no remorse; no hopes or desires, no fears; nothing
negative.<s=
pan>  </span>Thus it is also then a
Mono-Pole reality; all positive an=
d no negative; (hence no negation).<span>  </span>All good, no bad.<sp=
an>  </span>All beauty, no ugliness.<span> 
</span>All `now', no =
past or future.<span> 
</span>All understanding and affirmation, no do=
ubt or unknowing.<span>  </span>All answers, no questions.<span> =
 </span>Good grief almighty, why was anything ever
created so good?<span>&n=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" s=

quest and passio=
n for the deepest knowledge of selfhood and understanding
brings knowledge =
of the deepest depths of the all. And the incarnate effect is
amazing and l=
ife enhancing. For we learn how to walk and ride on the waves of
