Dr Subramanian Swamy
Image=
 Credit: Nilima Pathak/Gulf News
New Delhi: Dr Subramanian Swamy is Preside=
nt of Janata Party. Well-educated and honest, he is not only courageous, bu=
t extremely blunt and forthright in his views.
Widely known for publicly ch=
allenging and fighting against prime ministers and chief ministers, it woul=
d do well for his political opponents to remain on the right side of Swamy.=
 For, his wrath can undo governments, leave alone individuals!
=C2=A0
Thoug=
h his histrionics have earned him the reputation of being a rabble-rouser, =
no one can claim to find anything incriminating against him to charge or dr=
ag him to court.
Speaking to=C2=A0Gulf News=C2=A0in an exclusive interview,=
 Swamy has openly spelt out names on the telecom spectrum scam accusing bot=
h political and media persons for being corrupt.
=C2=A0
GULF NEWS:=C2=A0You=
 seem to be treading into familiar territory with 2G spectrum scam what wit=
h earlier taking the cudgels with Janata Dal leader Ramakrishna Hegde and A=
ll India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader Jayalalitha and several othe=
rs?=C2=A0
=C2=A0
SUBRAMANIAN SWAMY:=C2=A0This is a very serious matter. The=
 others were for a very different reason.=C2=A0Hegde was a member of my par=
ty and crafted the impression that he was a very honest and upright man. Bu=
t he was most crooked and did all kinds of rackets. And, of course, he was =
tapping telephones of his own people, including his girlfriends! A man who =
pretends morality had to be exposed. Strangely, in 1988, our own party deci=
ded to investigate the incident of telephone tapping and he supported it th=
inking I wouldn't get to the bottom of it. When trapped, he filed a defamat=
ion case against me and later withdrew, which ended his career.
=C2=A0
In t=
he case of Jayalalitha, I helped her win the elections and become the Chief=
 Minister. I was also instrumental in providing her adequate security after=
 the DMK (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) government, which was close to the LTT=
E (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) was dismissed. But after winning, she =
began doing all the rotten things that the DMK was doing. Whether she or he=
r associates did, I can't say. I questioned her and she got angry with me. =
In the process she started letting loose violence against me. That's when I=
 said to her, =E2=80=98I'll teach you a lesson'. I dropped everything, sat =
in Tamil Nadu, and brought her down.
=C2=A0
Is it because of bringing down =
governments that you are known as a troublemaker?=C2=A0
=C2=A0
That's not t=
rue. There are also governments where I've helped. Like, the Narasimha Rao =
government couldn't have survived but for me. I created the Chandra Shekhar=
 government, which actually initiated the reforms even though it didn't get=
 the credit because it did not last very long. I helped Rajiv Gandhi surviv=
e in his worst days when everybody abandoned him.
=C2=A0
Just because they =
[the politicians] can't say I'm corrupt or illiterate, they spread this usu=
al propaganda that I'm a troublemaker. The public doesn't think so. Else I =
wouldn't have been elected to Parliament five times.
=C2=A0
But haven't you=
 kind of dragged Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to court =E2=80=94 something=
 that was till now unheard of?
=C2=A0
Yes, but I also saved him because I t=
hought the press was getting out of control and over-drawing the picture. I=
 said that he sat on my petition to permit me to prosecute telecommunicatio=
ns minister Andimuthu Raja. Now, for the first time in the history of India=
 the Supreme Court has directed the PM to file an affidavit. This affidavit=
 shows that every letter of mine was marked by him for action, but his offi=
cials told him he didn't have to. He didn't know the law and I don't expect=
 him to. But since Raja was forced to resign by him, I didn't want any more=
 sanctions and said the PM didn't need to resign.=C2=A0Now they [Congress p=
ersons] were wild, because they wanted to shoot him with their guns on my s=
houlder.
=C2=A0
Who do you mean by =E2=80=98they'?
=C2=A0
Congress Presiden=
t Sonia Gandhi. She wants someone more pliable than Singh. He's pliable eno=
ugh, but obviously, she is not satisfied.
=C2=A0
And who do you think could=
 be considered more pliable?
=C2=A0
Defence Minister A.K. Antony, if she ca=
n't bring in her son Rahul Gandhi.
=C2=A0
Are you getting to all this becau=
se your party is nowhere in the picture and you wish to remain in limelight=
?
=C2=A0
First of all, whether I'm doing it for this or that reason, the qu=
estion is am I speaking the truth. Is there corruption or not? It doesn't m=
atter what my motivation is. These are cheap diversionary tactics, which I =
don't take seriously.
=C2=A0
Why has it taken two years for the 2G spectrum=
 scam to come to light?
=C2=A0
That's because it took me more than one-and-=
a-half years to get hold of the documents, which was not easy. I had writte=
n to the PM in 2008 and he took two years.
=C2=A0
On what basis do you say =
that it could=C2=A0possibly be the case of the most monumental corruption i=
n world history?
=C2=A0
Look at the sheer size of the amount of Rs1.76 tril=
lion (Dh142 billion) the nation has lost. And I'm not talking about the bri=
be, which itself is pretty big. The total loss, had there been an auction, =
and what actually it was sold for (Rs100 billion), is huge. The bribe is a =
thing that out of the gain these people have potentially made and will make=
 over the years. My estimate is Rs600 billion of bribe involved.
=C2=A0
Do =
you suspect the roles of some journalists and editors including Hindustan T=
imes columnist Vir Sanghvi and NDTV's Barkha Dutt in this scam?
=C2=A0
Most=
 people are relying on corporate lobbyist Nira Radia tapes.=C2=A0But I know=
 from personal experience that journalists do a lot of hack jobs. If wanted=
, they character assassinate you at the behest of the ruling party.=C2=A0In=
 my case, the media cannot say anything except that I'm a troublemaker, whi=
ch doesn't sell very well. They don't publish anything I say unless it beco=
mes impossible like now, because the telecom scam has become a big issue. T=
hey've been doing it systematically.=C2=A0When elections take place, many j=
ournalists come and ask for money, saying they'll give favourable coverage =
in return.
=C2=A0
In the case of Vir Sanghvi, I know he used to visit Phuke=
t [in Thailand] almost every weekend and the Tamil Tigers used to finance h=
is trips. Because of his lifestyle, I knew he was amenable and a real fixer=
. He's been writing articles depending on who's in power. As for Barkha Dut=
t, she's been indiscreet and doing foolish things.
=C2=A0
You're quoted as =
saying that though the PM is honest, others are not. Who are these persons?=

=C2=A0
Yes, he is honest, but officials around him like his Principal Secr=
etary T.K.A. Nair and Cabinet Secretary Pulok Chatterjee are not with him. =
They are all Sonia's appointees. Even if you ask for the PM's appointment, =
her people decide who can and cannot see him.
=C2=A0
You've also said that =
if the PM resigns, it will strengthen those who made money. Could you name =
them?
=C2=A0
Sonia and DMK party chief M Karunanidhi.
=C2=A0
You mean Raja =
is just a face and the real culprits are the biggies of the DMK?
=C2=A0
Raj=
a got 10 per cent, Karunanidhi 30 per cent and Sonia's two sisters have got=
 60 per cent of the loot.
=C2=A0
Have you done in-depth research and invest=
igation to make such claims?
=C2=A0
Yes, I've enormous access because whate=
ver my enemies may say, one thing is there that I've never betrayed anybody=
. Today, people in the government are so fed up seeing everything happening=
 in close range and=C2=A0all this material is available with the PM.
=C2=A0=

Why is the UPA - 2 seeing so many scams?
=C2=A0
Earlier, the scams were re=
lated to the defence deals, where things were difficult. Now, they have got=
 into things within the country. And since there are lots of players, some =
of them spill the beans.
=C2=A0
You think the recent Mumbai's Adarsh housin=
g and 2 G spectrum scams could be inter-related?
=C2=A0
Yes, looks like it.=
 Lots of loans have been given, which obviously have been used
.
How soon d=
o you think all this will come out?
=C2=A0
Raja getting an arrest warrant w=
ill happen soon and cancellation of the licences given so far could happen =
within the next 2-3 months. As far as the recovery of the money is concerne=
d, of which there is a big demand in the country, that will take time.
=C2=
=A0
However, if the Americans, who know it all, co-operate, we can get it b=
ecause there is the UN agreement on money laundering.
=C2=A0
Do you think t=
he Congress will ask the Americans?
=C2=A0
No, they won't. But I can force =
them to. It's only a matter of time.=C2=A0They know what I can do in court.=
=C2=A0They can't buy my lawyers, because I don't keep any!=C2=A0I argue cas=
es myself.
=C2=A0
Why is the Congress so adamant about not having a Joint P=
arliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into the 2 G scam?
=C2=A0
That's because=
 the JPC will be free for all.=C2=A0And they know that I will start advisin=
g the MPs what questions to ask.
=C2=A0
One of the questions is about her [=
Sonia's] sisters having got the money. And if the JPC calls for the=C2=A0in=
telligence people, they will=C2=A0have to question her=C2=A0because=C2=A0th=
e data is now with them.
=C2=A0
