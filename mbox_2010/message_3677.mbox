Namaste,

At the end of 700th Verse, one should say 'Vaushat' and Vaushat s=
hould be logically added after 'Klim Om'.

It is ok to Skip 'Dhyaanam' whic=
h comes at the begining of each chapter.

I suggest 'Kshama Prartha' to be =
recited after Meditation and just BEFORE taking Mother back in the heart.

=
some learned members can correct me if i am not accurate.

Best Regards,

U=
