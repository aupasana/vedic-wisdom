Hello,

Sorry for writing this offtopic post. These questions were not dire=
cted to me. Nor i know answers to these technicals. I just wanted to share =
an interesting incidence.

Three days back a patient came to me to take tre=
atment for fever. He is an old diabetic, hypertensive and have deranged ren=
al functions.

I prescribed him medicines. Two days back he came back. he s=
till had fever. When i asked why he didn't took medicines he answered "I di=
dn't knew whether these medicines are compatible with medicines i am alread=
y taking"

I assured him that i knew about his ongoing medicines and medici=
nes i prescribed are fully in accordance to earlier treatment and he should=
 take the medicine.

Yesterday he came back. He still had fever. When i ask=
ed why he didn't took medicines he answered "I am not sure that these medic=
ines are safe for  my kidneys or not as these are secreted by kidneys also.=
 i read on internet" I assured him that they are safe as these medicines ar=
e secreted by liver and only very small fraction is secreted from kidneys w=
hich are negligible and he should take the medicine other wise fever will n=
ot be cured.

Today he came again. He still had fever. When iasked why he d=
idnt took medicines he answered "i was not sure that these medicines will c=
ause acidity or not"

I told him that all the medicines for fever can cause=
 acidity but it is not necessary for every patient. it differs from patient=
 to patient. Whether they cause acidity or not to you You will get to know =
only if you take them. Because proof of pudding is in eating.

Please tell =
me what to do if he comes back tomorrow without taking medicines. Anyone pl=
ease help.

Thanks in anticipation

Atul
