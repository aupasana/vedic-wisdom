Hard work can do wonders         
[http://img32.imageshack.us/img32/7933/sh=
ivabhagiratha.jpg]

In Indian culture vairaagyam was always given ultimate =
importance. But
careful, there is a very thin line that separates vairaagya=
m and
laziness. In vairaagyam all karma is done but without expecting anyth=
ing
in return, without being involved in the materialistic aspects of karma=
.
Bhagiratha, with his unparalleled effort to bring Ganga to earth, showed
=
us how much effort a man can put in and as a result what wonders can be
don=
e.

On knowing that his ancestors (60000 Sagara Kumaras) will reach swarga
=
only if the pure waters of Ganga flow through their ashes, from his
mother,=
 Bhagiratha immediately leaves to Himalayas to do tapas for Lord
Brahma:

A=
fter purifying himself in a pushkarini, it starts tapas with
extra-ordinary=
 concentration. Starts with padmaasana and in winter stood
in the freezing =
waters of the lake with water up to chest! In Summer
stands in the middle o=
f burning pancha-agnis (four agnis + sun) and
steadily stared at the sun wi=
th eyes wide open (all the while
concentrating on Brahma deva)!!

During th=
e first few days, he had food only once a day. Later it was
once in a few d=
ays. Then it became once in a month. After that, he just
used to drink a li=
ttle water and continue his `Tapas'. Finally
the air was his only food!!! 1=
000 years passed=85.!!!!

Brahma, the creator of the worlds, on the request=
s of Gods to save them
from the tremendous tapaagni of Bhagiratha, appears =
before him and
blesses him with children and Ganga. However, Brahma deva su=
ggests that
none except Parama Shiva can take the force when Ganga falls on=
to earth,
and if not with that force earth will be washed away=85

Men are =
of three kinds:

There are cowards, who do not begin their work at all, afr=
aid that some
trouble may arise midway. Those who begin but later give up t=
he task,
afraid of the difficulties that arise. Brave people who belong to =
a
third group. They continue to work in spite of even an army of
difficulti=
es, and finally achieve the goal.

Bhagiratha belonged to this third catego=
ry of brave men. He again began
a severe `Tapas' to please Lord Ishwara. Wi=
th folded hands, and
standing on one leg, he meditated on Lord Iswara with =
the deepest
concentration. So a whole year passed. Pleased with Bhagiratha'=
s
devotion Lord ishwara takes the immense force of Ganga and controls her
i=
n his jataajutam. He completely stops her from flowing to teach her a
lesso=
n (she was a mischievous girl, proud of her strength!), but for
Bhagiratha =
it was another difficulty=85 But he again with tapas
pleases Lord Shiva to =
release Ganga down to earth. Ganga followed
Bhagiratha shyly and slowly, li=
ke his daughter (Bhaagirathi). But she
grew a little mischievous, though Sh=
iva taught her a lesson once, when
near Jahnu maharshi's ashram. She wander=
ed all over the Ashrama like
a small girl and the entire place was filled w=
ith water. Disturbed from
tapas by it, Jahnu maharshi in a single gulp swal=
lows her entirely. And
suddenly difficulties again for Bhagiratha. But it i=
s not the first time
for him, so immediately pleases Jahnu maharshi (Jaahna=
vi comes out of
Jahnu maharshi's ear) and finally sends his ancestors to hi=
gher
worlds=85..

Morals in the story:

1.Karma must be done in massive qua=
ntity as Bhagiratha did, but
selflessly=85

2. Brave people continue to wor=
k in spite of even an army of
difficulties, and finally achieve their goal.=


3. Man can achieve wonders, once he puts in effort and dedication=85.

4 =
One must never be proud of one's strength or other qualities. Else
you will=
 be humiliated when you meet a greater person. (Shiva taught the
naughty ki=
d, Ganga, a lesson by controlling her unparralled strength &
force, with gr=
eat ease=85.)
