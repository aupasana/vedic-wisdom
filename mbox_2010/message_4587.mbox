 On Monday, July 2, Appachi Mama, the head priest of Sri Ramanasramam,
pass=
ed away at a Vellore hospital due to a sudden stroke. He was 80 years
old a=
nd had served in Sri Ramanasramam since his youth. His departure has
sadden=
ed all those who have benefited by his devotion and service all these
decad=
es. In his usual modest manner, Appachi Mama briefly described his life
in =
a recent video interview. The following text has been extracted from this
i=
nterview.

I joined the Ashram Vedapatasala on January 8, 1942 and finished=
 my course
in 1950. During those years the Patasala boys had to perform mos=
t of the
Ashram chores. This included assisting the priest in the Mother=E2=
=80=99s temple,
cleaning the kitchen after every meal, grinding the coffee =
beans every
evening, shifting huge vessels from the fire, spreading rice fo=
r mixing at
the poor feeding, serving the devotees and the servants. The re=
st of the
time we had our Veda lessons.

Once, while serving Bhagavan and o=
thers, Bhagavan asked for some more
buttermilk. I went to the kitchen and t=
ook the bucket containing the
buttermilk and served Bhagavan, not knowing t=
hat this was the sour
buttermilk which was put aside for the servants. Bhag=
avan drank the
buttermilk and never said anything. But the kitchen staff to=
ok me to task. I
was shocked to know that inadvertently I served sour butte=
rmilk to Bhagavan.
I was too shy and frightened to face him. Even during th=
e morning and
evening Veda Parayana in the hall I sat at a distance from hi=
m and at meals
avoided serving him. However, after two days had passed and =
finding that he
did not mention anything about the incident I took courage =
and started
serving him again.

In 1950 after Bhagavan=E2=80=99s Maha Nirva=
na, I joined a secondary school and after
finishing the eighth standard I t=
ook a teachers training course. I then
served as a teacher for three years =
in Tirukoilur and Tanjore. At the time
my pay was 45 rupees per month. Kris=
hnamurthy (Kittu), who was working as a
priest in the Ashram, wrote to me a=
nd asked me to return to serve in the
Ashram with a salary of only 15 rupee=
s per month. Though the pay was low, I
thought it was a call from Bhagavan =
himself to serve him, and heeding this
call resigned my job, came and settl=
ed at the Ashram.

In those days the Ashram income was insufficient and irr=
egular.
Consequently, we used to be paid only when there were enough funds.=
 These
days, of course, even before the end of the month we get our pay. Th=
ings
have changed considerably.

As the electrician and plumber would not c=
ome to the Ashram when called, I
also took up that work. I did most of the =
electrification and plumbing to
the newly built cottages. I also had to pre=
pare naivedya, do the grinding
work for the temple, go to the town for coll=
ecting papers, get signatures
from the trustees maintaining accounts, etc. =
All these responsibilities
devolved on me. Later on the situation improved =
and the Ashram had its own
plumber and electrician, and the other jobs were=
 taken over by the office
staff. In this manner, I have been at the service=
 of Bhagavan for more than
50 years.
