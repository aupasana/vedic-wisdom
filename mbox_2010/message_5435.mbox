Introducti=
on to Dr. David Frawley's Book "Universal Hinduism: Towards a New Vision of=
 Sanatana Dharma"

By Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya

The spiritual traditio=
n of Hinduism was intended from its very inception in the heart of God to b=
e an inherently universal phenomenon in both the scope of its philosophical=
 concern and in its practical applicability. Hinduism is a religion that is=
 designed by its very nature to be open and welcoming to all of the world's=
 diverse people, regardless of their individual ethnicity, race, caste or l=
anguage. This global reality of Hinduism is clearly reflected in the origin=
al Sanskrit terms found within its own Vedic scriptures that are used to de=
scribe the religion. Hinduism is historically referred to in the scriptures=
 as Sanatana Dharma, the "Eternal Natural Way"; Vishva Dharma, the "Univers=
al Way"; and Vaidika Dharma, the "Way of Truth", among many other self-refe=
renced appellations.

Hinduism was always in reality so much more than mere=
ly the "religion of India". Throughout its history, Hinduism has always bee=
n a trans-geographical spiritual-cultural matrix, a universal spiritual cul=
ture designed to be practiced by all the people of the Earth. This fact is =
attested to by the history of Sanatana Dharma. Even as recently as 2500 yea=
rs ago, the Hindu sphere of direct cultural influence was not limited in an=
y way to only India, but ranged over at least two-thirds of Asia. In the pr=
e-Buddhist era, the entire territory ranging from much of ancient Persia (t=
oday's Iran), Central Asia and Afghanistan in the West; extending into the =
South Asian region that today includes such nations as India, Pakistan, Nep=
al, Bhutan, Tibet, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh; and including the South-East =
Asian nations of Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indone=
sia, and much of south China and the Philippines were predominantly Hindu s=
tates.

On a more peripheral scale, centuries of scholarly research have re=
peatedly demonstrated that Hindu and Dharmic influences extended also to mu=
ch of ancient Celtic, Germanic, Greco-Roman, Hittite, Mesopotamian and pre-=
Columbian cultures as well, to name only a few. Indeed, in the ancient worl=
d scene of pre-Abrahamic history especially, it could be justifiably argued=
 that the Dharmic way of living and thinking served as the paradigmatic fou=
ndation of almost every important culture and civilization on earth.  

The=
 boundless breadth and expansive depth of Hinduism is found not only extern=
ally in its historically global reach and universal influence, but also int=
ernally in its multiple and well-developed arts and sciences. For unlike an=
y other spiritual world-view in existence, there is no aspect of the human =
experience - from the aesthetic, literary, scientific, economic, medical an=
d political realms, to those of philosophy, metaphysics, psychology and ult=
imate mystical transcendence - that Hinduism does not address directly, sys=
tematically and conclusively. It is, in fact, especially through its arts a=
nd sciences that we now see Hinduism once again beginning to spread its ben=
evolent influence throughout the entire world after a two-thousand year per=
iod of forced steady decline.

Throughout the entire globe, in almost every=
 nation on earth, from Europe and the Americas, to the former Soviet Union,=
 East Asia and even the Middle East, we have witnessed a virtual explosion =
in the last few decades alone of multiple tens of millions of the Earth's d=
iverse inhabitants enthusiastically embracing such core Hindu practices as =
Yoga, ayurveda, jyotisha, mantra meditation, vastu, chakra work, vegetarian=
ism and natural healing, as well as deeply appreciating overtly Hindu forms=
 of philosophy, music, foods and art. As Dr. Frawley himself states in this=
 work, "Hinduism is once more emerging in its full scope as Sanatana Dharma=
, a universal and eternal tradition of truth, knowledge and consciousness t=
hat encompasses all life and is relevant to all creatures - which is its or=
iginal formulation." (pg. 6)

Indeed, what is even more revealing about the=
 nature of the current Hindu resurgence is the fact that we now have millio=
ns of non-Indians globally who consciously identify Hinduism as their chose=
n religion; and who, when asked what their religion is, will verbally asser=
t with pride: "I am a Hindu!" Thus, what began in its original inception as=
 a Vishva Dharma - a universal spiritual path - has now come full circle to=
 become a truly world religion once again. As the entire world continues to=
 adopt Hindu practices at lightning speed, it is now safe to say that the v=
ast global influence of Hinduism lay not only in the historical past, but a=
s an ever-increasing future reality. The Vedic world-view can no longer be =
seen as something that is to be relegated to an archaic past, and of intere=
st only to a hand-full of self-serving academicians, scholars and "Indologi=
sts" scrambling to make a name for themselves in their attempt to lay intel=
lectual claim to the corpse of a supposedly dead culture. Rather, Sanatana =
Dharma is a living and dynamic spiritual phenomenon. Hinduism does not repr=
esent the past. It is the future. 

The present work by Dr. David Frawley (=
Sri Vamadeva Shastri) serves in itself as a further important piece of evid=
ence documenting the revived universal scope of the Hindu world-view. Writt=
en by a well-respected contemporary Yogi, Vaidya, Veda-Acharya and Hindu sc=
holar of specifically Western origin, "Universal Hinduism: Towards a New Vi=
sion of Sanatana Dharma" is a crucially relevant and important work that ne=
eds to be, not merely read in a cursory manner, but deeply analyzed by all =
serious Hindu practitioners, activists, gurus and leaders. In this work, Dr=
. Frawley not only documents the many positive influences that the Hindu wo=
rld-view continues to have upon the entire world, but more, he explains in =
brilliant fashion why the re-universalization of Hindu Dharma is both natur=
al to the religion's very essence, and thus an inevitable development.

Lik=
e many of Dr. Frawley's previously published, highly innovative works, "Uni=
versal Hinduism" is a groundbreaking book in many respects. For this work l=
ays out like no other book has been capable of to date both 1) an expositio=
n of the natural universality of Hinduism and its fast growing appeal to mi=
llions of non-Hindus throughout the globe, as well as 2) a blueprint for ho=
w to ensure that Hinduism continues to make its transition from a religion =
that experienced a thousand years of persecution to now again becoming a po=
werful world religion in a manner that will be most conducive for its healt=
hy continued growth. This book is nothing less than a clear manifesto for e=
nsuring the rightful place of Sanatana Dharma as a global force for good in=
 the 21st Century. The number and scope of topics that Dr. Frawley brillian=
tly addresses in this work are too numerous to address deeply in a brief pr=
efatory exercise as mine. I do, however, wish to highlight a few topics tha=
t I think are especially crucial.

In outlining the universal nature of Hin=
duism, Dr. Frawley very expertly avoids the common pitfall perpetrated by a=
ll too many Hindu leaders of reducing Hindu universalism to what I have pre=
viously termed "Radical Universalism". As the author ably points out, the f=
act that Hinduism is a religion that is universal in nature and is open to =
being practiced and to full adoption by all human beings is in no way to be=
 equated with the false notion that all religious and spiritual paths are i=
ndistinguishable from one another. Hinduism does not teach that all religio=
ns are the same. Dr. Frawly correctly reminds us that Sanatana Dharma is it=
s own unique and systematized spiritual tradition that contains within its =
inherent being a distinctive sense of spiritual/cultural identity, history =
and purpose. As Dr. Frawley so well states the problem in the first chapter=
 of this work:

"Hindu universalism is not a radical universalism that equa=
tes religions as they are and removes any differentiation between religious=
 teachings and doctrines. Hindu universalism reflects an understanding of u=
niversal law that cannot be made subordinate to religious dogmas, beliefs, =
faiths or institutions. Hindu universalism leads us to a rigorous science o=
f consciousness, not simply to an attempt to make all religious doctrines t=
he same." (pg. 48)

As Sanatana Dharma currently finds itself in its on-goi=
ng attempt to interface its concerns with eternality vis-=E0-vis the presen=
t fact of modernity, it must both re-embrace its universal relevance for al=
l of the Earth's diverse human beings, while simultaneously retaining its o=
wn unique identity. Hinduism is not Christianity, nor is it Islam, Buddhism=
 or Taoism. Hinduism is Sanatana Dharma: The Eternal Natural Way. It is onl=
y in rejecting the extreme notion of Radical Universalism, and asserting in=
stead the universal applicability of Dharma in everyday life, that the futu=
re of Hinduism will remain secure, strong and relevant to the entire world.=


Up until the appearance of this present work by Dr. Frawley, very few Hin=
du writers had written about the overtly political implications of Dharma a=
s instantiated in contemporary political and governance issues. Two of the =
few exceptions to this rule were the brilliant Hindu scholars and writers S=
ri Ram Swarup and Sri Sitaram Goel. While many knowledgeable Hindus had alw=
ays recognized that Dharma is not merely a spiritual path, but is also an i=
deological world-view that has direct insights to offer in the realms of po=
litics, economics and social sciences, not many had been able to envision p=
recisely what an ideology of Dharma politics would entail or even look like=
. In recognizing that Sanatana Dharma now finds itself once again in a posi=
tion to assert itself as a growing global force for future spiritual, polit=
ical, economic and cultural change, Dr. Frawley outlines throughout this bo=
ok precisely what a healthy politically-engaged Hinduism will look like, as=
 well as what it must emphasize and seek to accomplish, in overt political =
terms. Part three of Dr. Frawley's work is especially innovative and crucia=
lly relevant in this regard.

Up till now, the political expression of Hind=
uism has been relegated to no more than a confused and not wholly successfu=
l sense of Indian nationalism, or "Hindu Nationalism", as its polemically-d=
riven critics in academia and the media have repeatedly termed it. In keepi=
ng with the universal nature and relevance of Sanatana Dharma, however, Dr.=
 Frawley correctly asserts that confining Hinduism to a mere parochial sens=
e of Indian or Hindu nationalism is ultimately both politically shortsighte=
d and not in keeping with the eternal mandate that Hinduism has to potentia=
lly inform and reform all political discourse universally. Dharma politics,=
 like the eternal path of Sanatana Dharma that forms its very basis, cannot=
 be relegated only to the current political scene in contemporary India, bu=
t must offer a vision of a better world for all human beings who inhabit ou=
r increasingly shrinking planet. Dharma is not a genetically circumscribed =
race or a nationality, but is universal Truth. Similarly, Dharma politics i=
s necessarily open to all and has practical answers to offer all people, re=
gardless of race, nationality or even religious affiliation.

In Dr. Frawle=
y's vision of what such a universal, Dharma-based political ideology seeks,=
 he states: "To create a society in harmony with nature and with peace amon=
g all people, there must first be a dharmic foundation in order to uphold i=
t...we need a view of human civilization in harmony with all life...". (pg.=
 173) The author then clearly states what some of the important issues are =
that Dharma directly addresses. Thus, Dr. Frawley asserts, Hinduism can and=
 must provide the philosophical foundation of not merely a narrowly envisio=
ned Indian nationalism, but a universally applicable Dharma Nationalism tha=
t all human beings can employ in their respective nation-states, communitie=
s and villages to make our world a more peaceful, compassionate and civiliz=
ed place. While "Universal Hinduism" is designed to be neither an exclusive=
 exposition on Dharma political science per se, nor purely a political mani=
festo, it does cover previously unchartered ground in this regard, and I lo=
ok forward to seeing Dr. Frawley write in an even more concentrated way on =
this precise topic in the future. 

The fact that Dr. Frawley's "Universal =
Hinduism: Towards a New Vision of Sanatana Dharma" is destined to become an=
 instant classic in modern Hindu literature is both a given and a highly ap=
propriate fact in my mind. It is a brilliant work. In it, Dr. Frawley provi=
des the tools necessary to reformulate the eternal message of Hinduism, to =
communicate that message in until now untapped avenues of outreach, and to =
thus potentially reposition Hinduism on the world stage as the noble and ke=
enly relevant global religion that it always has been. Dr. David Frawley - =
Sri Veda-Acharya Vamadeva Shastri - may have chosen to be physically born i=
n a White American, formerly Christian, body in this lifetime. But I assure=
 the reader that his inner self is nothing less than one of Dharma's most c=
herished children, born in our day to elucidate the way of Hindu Dharma for=
 all the world to better understand and appreciate.
