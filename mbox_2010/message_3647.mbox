Namaste KK,

Yes! You are right. Shri Krushna has said that in a verse.

Le=
t me take Vivekananda as a 'Noble' Idle as described by Lord Krushna and my=
self as Ordinary mortal.

*Vivekananda *occasionally* smokes and I am very =
happy to know that fact and start smoking every day. 

* Vivekananda *once =
in a blue moon* ate meat and I am overjoyed because i got the license of ea=
ting meat every alternate day to satisfy my cravings of palate.

* Vivekana=
nda lead the life of *perfect celibacy* all his life and now i am abscondin=
g. Not to seen anywhere. He sacrificed his entire life for the upliftment o=
f mankind and i just live for my selfish end. 

No amount of arguments conv=
inces me for this. i do not know but i have an Aghori attitude in this part=
icular issue.  

Aghorian Regards :),

Utpal

tever I wrote above seems sufficient to answer the questions you asked. Let=

 of Swami Vivekananda or Vimalananda or Sainbaba or any other such acknowle=
dged spiritual giants, we tend to forget that they are all realized souls w=
ho achieved very high level of spiritual realization. They are knower of ev=
erything or many things in the universe. Their individual ego is perfectly =
and completely tuned to universal ego. In short they *know* what they are d=
oing. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis'. Relevant to our topic of discussion, I w=
ould say that if they ate meat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco or killed ani=
mals, they actually knew what they are doing. There would be surely a speci=
fic purpose behind each and every action of theirs because as I said, they =
know complete background behind their each action and

f identification is missing from the action and hence it is like Nature ope=
rates through them to accomplish a special purpose without binding them in =
any cause-effect chain.
> Ramakrishna used to frequently say to all his dis=
ciples that Naren is very different from others. He has a blazing spiritual=
 fire burning within him which can consume anything and everything. A food =
restriction does not bind him. He can eat anything without getting spiritua=

ne of them and then slowly try to eradicate their habits of meat eating and=
 such other undesirable habits. It is also possible at the same time that h=

ate. It is also possible that he would have showered his unseen blessings o=

 apparent reasons for that but just a natural inconsequential act. We'll no=

ananda saved a boy from drowning in a lake in USA while he was still in Ind=
ia and did not even planned to go to USA. When the boy, after some

 actually met Swami in USA for the first time, swami immediately told him t=
o stay away from water and when he requested swami to accept him as his dis=
ciple, swami, after a moments thought told him that he is not his guru and =
his guru will come later and will give him Silver Cup as a gift. That man l=
ater became disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda and after 40 years, he was act=
