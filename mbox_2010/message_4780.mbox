Namaste Sandeep.

'Jnananaam chinmayateeta, shoonyanam shoonyasakshini' as =
well as 'prakritipurushatmakam jagat'- these fragments from the Devi atharv=
asheersham sums up my feeling on your questions.


To the sadhaka, the inte=
llect is not who he/she is. He/She/It- the divine as well as the sadhaka is=
 beyond the intellect, beyond consciousness itself.

The concept of Shiva S=
hakti aikyam(oneness) reflects the fact that 'When Shiva acts, He is Shakti=
(Siddha Siddhanta Paddhati by Shree Guru Gorakshanatha)'. Anthropomorphism =
does not help in understanding here.

There is no cure or answer for all th=
ese questions but direct experience. Direct experience comes with sadhana a=
nd grace.Dont wait for all intellectual questions to be answered. If you do=
/are doing sadhana under the guidance of a Guru, everything will be answere=
d. 

When one does sakamya(with desire) upasana/sadhana, then it is require=
d to be very careful with any tantrika practice as one is dealing with a gr=
eat deal of power and one is trying to control that power( of the entire un=
iverse) with ones endeavours and our all too human intellect. If one is doi=
ng nishkamya upasana offering everything to the Deity, then there is nothin=
g to be afraid of in all the worlds- because we are controlled and guided b=
y Jaganmatha and that is all there is to it.So to answer your question dire=
ctly-it does not depend who you worship. What matters is your attitude. Dev=
i is capable of giving anything just like a Deva is- they are indistinct- t=
he like water and its wetness.

If you want mundane benefit or just relief =
from your past sins by some 'gnanam' then that is what is given.Look at Rav=
ana for example- who was a Rishi putra and a great tapasvi and Shiva sadhak=
a as an extreme example of this.
If you want the Devi or Devatha Himself or=
 Herself or Para gnanam( the ultimate gnana) then that is what you will get=
.

Regardless, in time one of my Gurus has said that even a sakamya upasaka=
 is led to nishkamya- though it may take lifetimes. Doing sadhana even for =
kamya is better than not doing sadhana at all.

Regards

S

I have been wondering a lot about the above concept, especially in relation=
 to the results of mantras for the same. The same theme repeats itself over=
 and over again in many ways:

In astrology mantras for planets versus mantras for signs (signs always rel=

is always at a progressively more outward level.

 idea behind all the male/female symbolism. Please correct me if this is wr=
ong. However, I still struggle with what is the result of devi/mahavidya ma=
ntra versus the other (I assume "male") mantras. Extending the same concept=
 as above, it would seem that the non-devi/non-mahavidya type mantras are t=
he ones that result in aligning one's actions with whatever it is that the =
mantra's goal is. While devi/mahavidya type mantras, in going with same sym=
bolism, would not actually directly influence one's actions but would give =
knowledge of the area of action, and thereby help in making the correct cho=
ice when indeed the time comes for action. This is purely my own conclusion=
. Is this correct?
