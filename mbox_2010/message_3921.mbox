Namaste Nagraj garu,

I just rephrased messages from Narasimha or PVR and M=
anish. So, these thanks
go to them and Mother. Narasimha and Manish have be=
st wishes or blessings
for anyone who wants to do sadhana. Narasimha mentio=
ned this in homam manual
as an answer to misconception#4. The stage is set.=
 We just need to remember
these messages, do our part, and learn together f=
rom our failures and
blissful moments. When it comes to spirituality, the m=
essage seems to be
easy to understand philosophically, easy to talk, and ea=
sy to write, but
super hard to act. I am nothing to bless you. Best wishes =
with your homam or
meditation or keertanas or whatever sadhana you pick.

-=
Kishore
