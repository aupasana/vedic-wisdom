Dear friends,

Namaskar!

Few friends of mine told me over t=
he week that non vegetarian food increases infertility in men and if the fu=
ture generation too continue to eat non veg food, many men would be sterile=
 in the near future. I have not studied biology or chemistry. So from layma=
n's point of view, i have understood from what others are telling 

1) meat=
 especially clogs the arteries and sexual reproduction in men is dependent =
on movement of blood. So not only heart that is affected in non veg eaters =
but also sexual reproduction system. this is surprising since non veg foods=
 are supposed to make men more rajasic and active. 

2) for the last 10 yea=
rs at least the chemicals are being used increasingly to make the animals m=
ore heavier and tasty after cooking. accordingly even fish, prawns, chicken=
s, goats, buffalo are all being fed with food that would make them grow fas=
ter and to make their flesh tastier.

3) people all over the world are igno=
ring such facts to their own peril.

I am a born vegetarian and i do not kn=
ow the facts about non veg foods.

Can someone explain the facts?

Thanks t=
o everyone,
Rajmohan
