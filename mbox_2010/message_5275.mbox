Namaste,
 
You can drink/eat some of the abhisheka liquid/solids as sacred tirtha (sacrament). If there is too much, you can throw it away. Ideally it is thrown in a river or ocean, but it may not be possible always and you may need to throw away elsewhere. You can also distribute it to people to drink/eat.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
