 26th Feb 1946

A visitor told Bhagavan: "Even in my dream, I sometimes fee=
l that I am
dreaming i.e. I am conscious that it is a dream and that a fall=
 there, for
instance, cannot hurt me and so on. How is that?"

Bhagavan:

H=
ow can that be? Even in a dream three must be hurt consequent on a fall. On=

the other hand, if you are aware it is a dream, you are no longer
dreaming=
.At the best,it may be the transition stage when you are awaking
from the d=
ream state.

Another visitor told Bhagavan that some of his dream experienc=
es stood very
firmly rooted in his mind, while others were not remembered a=
t all.

Bhagavan remarked:

"All that we see is a dream, whether we see it =
in the dream state or in the
waking state.On account of some arbitrary stan=
dards about the duration of
experience and so on,we all one experience a dr=
eam experience and another a
waking experience. With reference to Reality, =
both the experiences are
unreal.
