And another reason I respect Vedic thought and the Sanatana Dharma so much
=
is because it is not hung up about being the "one true right way" but
facil=
itates different temperaments to eventually reach the goal - moksha -
in th=
e best way geared for those particular temperaments. We find exactly
what w=
e need, each one of us who looks.
