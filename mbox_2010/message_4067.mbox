Talk 507

D. Devotee
M. Ramana Maharshi

D.: Aurobindo d=
oes not approve of castes. Do you approve of them?

M.: As for Aurobindo, y=
ou ask him. As for my opinion, how does it matter to
you? How will it be of=
 use to you? Have you got any opinion on the matter?
That alone will affect=
 you, not the opinion of others.

D.: I do not approve of the caste system.=
 Mahatma=E2=80=99s opinion is valuable as a
guidance. I want your blessings=
 in my attempts.

M.: Mahatma has told you to seek and find your Self. You =
will not do it but
require his blessings.

D.: I am trying to follow the in=
structions. But caste-distinction is
painful. It must go.

M.: To whom does=
 it cause pain?

D.: The members of the society...

M.: It is you who say i=
t. There are countries where there are no such
distinctions of caste. Are t=
hey free from trouble? There are
wars,internecine struggle, etc. Why do you=
 not remedy the evils there?

D.: There are troubles here also.

M.: Differ=
ences are always there. There are not only human beings, but also
animals, =
plants, etc. The state of affairs cannot be helped.

D.: We do not mind the=
 animals, etc., at present.

M.: Why not? If they could speak they would cl=
aim equality with you and
dispute your claims no less vigorously than human=
 beings.

D.: But we cannot help it. It is God=E2=80=99s work.

M.: If that=
 is God=E2=80=99s work then the other part is your work, is that so?

D.: I=
t is man-made distinction.

M.: You need not notice these distinctions. The=
re is diversity in the
world. A unity runs through the diversity. The Self =
is the same in all. There
is no difference in spirit. All the differences a=
re external and
superficial. You find out the Unity and be happy.

The pain=
 of diversity is overcome by the joy of the perception of unity.
Moreover, =
a king may disguise himself as a servant. That makes no difference
in the p=
erson.

D.: I do not object to differences. But the claims of superiority a=
re wrong.

M.: There are differences in the limbs of one=E2=80=99s body. Wh=
en the hand touches
the foot the hand is not defiled. Each limb performs it=
s function. Why do
you object to differences?

D.: The people feel the inju=
stice of caste distinction. It must be rooted
out.

M.: You can individuall=
y arrive at the state where such distinctions are not
perceived and be happ=
y. How can you hope to reform the world? Even if you
try you cannot succeed=
. Kavyakantha Ganapati Sastri offered to initiate
Harijans with mantras and=
 make Brahmins of them. But the Harijans did not
come forward to accept the=
 offer.
That shows they are themselves afflicted by an inferiority complex.=


Remove that complex first before you try to reform others.

Moreover, why=
 do you go to places where such distinctions are observed and
cause pain to=
 yourself? Why should you not seek places where they are not
observed and b=
e happy there?

Gandhiji also tries to bring about equality. He is also up =
against the
barrier of inferiority complex afflicting the lower orders. He =
cannot
enforce his views on others. He observes non-violence. So matters st=
and as
they are.

D.: We must work to obliterate caste-distinctions.

M.: T=
hen do it. If you have succeeded in the world, then see if the
distinctions=
 persist in this place.

D.: This must be the first place where I want to e=
ffect the reform.

M.: Why do you exert yourself so much to effect reforms?=
 Go to sleep and see
if there are differences. There you obliterate differe=
nces without any
effort. (Laughter).

External differences are bound to per=
sist, however hard we may try to
obliterate them. The attempts of so-called=
 social reformers, to do away with
such classes or divisions as varnasrama =
has created, have not succeeded, but
have only created new divisions and ad=
ded a few more castes or classes to
the already existing ones, such as the =
Brahmo-Samajists and the
Arya-Samajists.

The only solution is for each man=
 to realise his true nature.
