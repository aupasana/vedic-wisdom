12th July, 1938

Talk 501.

A young Mysorean asked:

D.: How did I get this=
 body?

M.: You speak of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 and the =E2=80=98body=E2=80=99=
. There is the relationship between the
two. You are not therefore the body=
. The question does not occur to the body
because it is inert. There is an =
occasion when you are not aware of the body
- namely, in deep sleep. The qu=
estion does not arise then. Nevertheless you
are there in sleep. To whom do=
es the question arise now?

D.: The ego.

M.: Yes. The body and the ego ris=
e up together and sink together. There is
an occasion when you are not asso=
ciated with the ego in deep sleep.Now you
are associated with the ego. Of t=
hese two states which is your real state?
You are present in sleep and the =
same =E2=80=9CYou=E2=80=9D is present now too. Why should
the doubt arise n=
ow and not then? You are right in saying that it is for the
ego. You are no=
t the ego. The ego is intermediate between the Self and the
body. You are t=
he Self. Find out the origin of the ego and see if the doubt
persists.

Sri=
 Bhagavan added after a few minutes: The answer, according to sastras,
will=
 be that the body is due to karma. The question will be how did karma
arise=
? We must say =E2=80=9Cfrom a previous body=E2=80=9D and so on without end.=
 The direct
method of attack is not to depend on invisible hypotheses but t=
o ask =E2=80=9CWhose
Karma is it? Or whose body?=E2=80=9D Hence I answered =
in this manner. This is more
purposeful.
