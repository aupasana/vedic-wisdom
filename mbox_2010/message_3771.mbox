ObstaclesThe obstacles to spiritual life given in the Patanjali Yoga
Sutras=
 are being given here briefly:
Physical Obstacles1. Ailments, sickness, dis=
ease or terrible physical
handicaps148This often is the result of some terr=
ible karma of past
life. In such conditions a great guru askshis disciple n=
ot to be
disappointed but continue doing sadhana inspite of this handicap. =
I
havegiven instances in the book how some good sadhaks have done it.2.
Unh=
appinessIn the case of Indians it is caused by all their worries with
their=
 families while this is not the casein the USA where family ties do
not exi=
st except in some sections of orthodox Christians. In theUSA the
problem is=
 very complex. It starts with the story of a broken home,
premarital sex,un=
happy relationships and finally the damage done by
psychiatrists whose roar=
ing businessthrives in 'discovering' complexes
in their patients and keepin=
g them rooted in childhoodabuses.3. Physical
Unsteadiness (resembling Parki=
nson's disease)The result of consumption
of intoxicants and wild habits lik=
e drug addiction leads to thissometime
or the other.4. Difficulties in Inha=
lationIt can be caused by asthma or
some other ailments. It definitely dest=
roys the rhythm of japamand
pranayam.5. Difficulties in Exhalation Same as =
number 4 above.
Psychological/Mental Obstacles6. Frustration Caused by Non =
Fulfilment of
DesiresIn the case of most disciples, whether Indians or pers=
ons of any
country, one's own frustrationsregarding wishes, desires related=
 to
their wordly, physical, sexual, material, career or family lifeis alway=
s
the most common obstacle. It is not easy to be non attached which I know
=
is God'sgreatest gift to a spiritual aspirant, yet it has to be
cultivated =
intelligently. All the knocks of lifeteach this valuable
lesson which we fo=
rget.7. Doubts It can be called the most common
obstacle of educated Indian=
s and most of theAmericans I have met. In the
USA they switch gurus as soon=
 as they do not find an instant pillfor
illumination. These days when there=
 is so much character assassination
of some of thesegurus in the USA, wheth=
er Indian or American, through
mischievous publicity, a disciple's doubtin =
his own guru can assail him
constantly. It is not necessary to treat it as =
an obstacle. Even ifthe
guru is a very ordinary person, that a sincere disc=
iple has to be
rewarded by God is wellknown to us in India. Losing faith in=
 one's own
guru, expecting quick supernormal powers(siddhis), or even illum=
ination,
the disciple cannot progress.8. Material/Sensual/Sexual
Obsessions=
Indians are familiar with the stories of their great rishis,
Vishwamitra, D=
urvasa and Naradafalling into temptations, suffering their
agonies but doin=
g their sadhana with greater intensity andzeal. There
can be no sadhak who =
does not fall into such temptations. The wiser
forget them,overcome those t=
emptations and regain their spiritual
splendour. Most of such stories are n=
otrecorded. In my talks with
hundreds of yogis, I learnt from them that the=
se temptations have
to149come, a sadhak, must fall into them. The wiser sad=
hak does not
despair. He decides not to fallinto those traps again and is e=
ver
cautious. In the USA somehow it has not been possible toconvince people=

that these could not be combined with spiritual demands of life. It
would =
be farbetter to be an honestly married man doing sadhana rather
than imagin=
ing fancifully that onecould have many relationships and also
a good spirit=
ual life.Spiritual Obstacles9. Illusory Spiritual
ExperiencesLike the wish =
fulfilment Freud talked of, every sadhak has
many spiritual experiences. Th=
ey canbe very damaging when the sadhak
mistakes them for real spiritual pro=
gress. I have written inthe book
that my own Guruji's instruction was to te=
st these experiences again and
again beforeaccepting them as genuine ones. =
I know of thousands of such
experiences of hundreds ofsadhaks and sadhikas =
which did damage to them
because it inflated their ego.10. Not Making Expec=
ted Spiritual
ProgressIt is very natural for a sadhak to feel that he has n=
ot made
adequate or expected spiritualprogress. It creates deepest frustrat=
ion.
I know of sadhaks who gave up their sadhana and tookto violent, vulgar=

or grossly materialistic life after such frustrations. To know spiritual
p=
rogress isbeing made and when not, is most confusing. It is well
explained =
in the fifteenth chapter of theGita which should be read
repeatedly.11. Not=
 Remaining Steady in Spiritual ProgressSome sadhaks
attain early success in=
 spiritual life but fail to remain steady. They
lose patienceand even give =
up their sadhana. This is the worst mistake
one can commit. After attaining=
 somereal tangible progress, there should
be no need to feel frustrated at =
all or panic.12. Neglecting SadhanaThis
need not be elaborated. The meaning=
 is crystal clear.13. CarelessnessIt
is the most common fault. Every good g=
uru instructs his disciple in some
do's and somedon'ts. They should always =
be remembered.14. LazinessIt
need not be explained. It is a common fault. I=
 have been a victim of
this repeatedly whenduring my office work and later =
load of astrological
research, I made no attempt to squeeze outsome time fo=
r my own sadhana.
Ways of Overcoming Frustration in Spiritual Life
The reme=
dies which work most miraculously in overcoming frustrations in
spiritual l=
ife are four:1501. Company of Happy PersonsA person who has
least attachmen=
ts, desires and frustrations in life is a happy man. He
hastranscended dual=
ities of life, if not totally, sufficiently well, to
be happy mostly. In hi=
s companythe astral vibrations of his personality
create a diffuse sense of=
 happiness. We have many suchpersons in India
among good Sadhakas. Remember=
 not to become a nuisance for them.2.
Showing Kindness to Unhappy PersonsIt=
 need not be elaborated. The
unconscious blessings of an unhappy person who=
m you havehelped will
always help you overcome your miserable spiritual con=
dition.3. Keeping
Alive Your Sense of Sacredness for the VirtuousDo not bec=
ome judgmental.
A virtuous man may stray from the path of virtue in a bad m=
oment.But he
will come back to his sacred state very easily. If you lose yo=
ur own
faith in thesacredness of his life, it does damage to you spirituall=
y.4.
Indifference to the Non-VirtuousIn the world we live in, a majority ar=
e
non-virtuous. Remain indifferent to them. Do not hatethem. Hatred is a
ba=
d and very damaging emotion, spiritually.
III Additions
To all the above, l=
et me add, what great yogis have told their
disciples.1. Do Not Invite a Yo=
gi to Your House FrequentlyA yogi leads a
life which is a total reversal of=
 the life you lead. If you begin to
invite him to yourhouse, you give him a=
 chance to go astray and get
attracted to sex and money. Then youyourself b=
egin to lose faith in him.
If he comes once in a while, uninvited serve him=
 properly butdo not
allow him to stay long in your house, for your own sake=
.(Instruction of
the great Yogi, Devraha Baba)2. Do Not Read Too Many Booh =
on Supposedly
Spiritual SubjectsIt is better to do your own sadhana as you =
have been
instructed. Reading too many books cancause more confusion. Write=
rs of
books on spiritual subjects may themselves be very confusedpersons bu=
t
with a gift for writing. Reading those books can create avoidable
conflic=
ts in yourmind.(Instruction of the great Vaishnava Guru, Prabhu
Bejoy Krish=
na Goswami)3. Keep Alive a Sense of Sacredness when it comes
to Money and S=
ex151A person obsessed with sex and money slips fastest
from spiritual path=
. I have met more cheatswho pretended to be
spiritual, tried to promote spi=
ritual, religious, ayurvedic and
astrologicalseminars, cheated others and a=
ccumulated money or promoted
themselves.Extend these tendencies to all the =
activities of your life.
Without this precaution your spiritual lifewill de=
teriorate very
fast.(Ramakrishna Paramhamsa)4. Take Bath at Least Twice a D=
ayA clean
body and a clean mind are necessary for sadhana. In my childhood =
I
remembermeeting white men coming to India with their stinking bodies and
=
thick yellowish layers on theirteeth resembling paint. The reason why
India=
ns were forbidden to go abroad became clear tome then. But it seems
that th=
e westerners have discovered the virtues of daily bath in the
recenttwo or =
three decades and from an Indian point of view, some
glimmerings of civiliz=
ations haveappeared in the west which we have
always associated with plunde=
ring imperialisms.(All yogis advise)5.
Avoid Carnivorous VegetarianismThe f=
ood you consume should be pure and
vegetarian. It should be known to you th=
at asstressed in the Gita and
the Chandogya Upanishad, the strongest spirit=
ual base of any sadhanais
pure food. For better spiritual life, do not cons=
ume even the milk of
cows fed on nonvegetarian fodder. The mad cow disease =
of England must be
taken as a warning. It is difficult toget pure and unadu=
lterated food in
India. But India's adulterated stuff is better than thecar=
nivorous
vegetarianism of Europe and the USA. The dangerously adulterated f=
ood of
Indiacan ruin health. Our incompetent governments can take no action=

against this inspite of theAnti-Adulteration Laws.(All yogis advise)6.
Tri=
ple Fires of LifeVishnu Purana states in clearest terms that it is
after se=
eing, suffering and realizing that no mancan escape the triple
fires of lif=
e, that one develops detachment and divine knowledge.
Theyare: the physical=
 ones likes sickness and psychological problems:the
natural ones like victi=
mization by fellow human beings and fear from
animal (accidents etc.in mode=
rn life): the spiritual ones as given in
the Patanjali Yoga Sutras.(Vishnu =
Purana)7. Signs of Spiritual
ProgressThe Gita gives some clear indications =
which can be used to see
how much spiritual progressanyone has made:1. To f=
eel that you are not a
significant person.2. To not be haughty.3. Forgivene=
ss.4.
Non-violence.5. Simple and honest speech.6. Serving the Guru.7. Inner=

and outer cleanliness.8. Inner stability.9. Self control.10. To be
non-att=
ached to life's enjoyments.11. Lack of pride.12. To think about
the world f=
ull of grief.13. Doing the duties of a householder without
any sense of att=
achment.14. Equanimity.15. Unconditional devotion to the
Lord.16. Love of s=
equestered life.17. Not to be attached to persons
immersed in worldliness.1=
8. Loving always the knowledge of the
divine.19. Experience of cosmic secre=
ts.(The Gita)
