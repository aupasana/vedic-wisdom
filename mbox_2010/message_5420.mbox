Namaste,
 
The law of karma ensures that each action performed by one results in a corresponding result (reaction from Nature). Don't worry too much and keep doing whatever you can. Nothing goes waste.
 
Regarding Priya's question, most people will need multiple births. The best is to stop thinking about when and how one makes progress and gets liberated. One who just keeps doing sadhana without such extraneous thoughts is very lucky and will make progress faster than one who constantly thinks of when results come and whether one is progressing.
 
A cricket batsman who says "I must hit this ball for a four" puts pressure and keeps missing balls or may even get out. One who does not care about when four runs come, when six runs come, when single comes, when no runs come, will just look at the ball and play it. This cool approach will maximize the chance of getting a four. One putting pressure on oneself may miss the opportunity when it comes!
 
Ultimately, even desire of liberation blocks one from liberation. In fact, liberation is not getting X or Y or Z. It is *dropping* attraction (and aversion) to various things. If one has a notion in the mind that there is something desirable called "liberation", one is not free. One needs to somehow pursue that notion! However, in the beginning, one needs to have that notion and pursue. But a stage should come when one does so many things but not think about results and does not want this or that.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
