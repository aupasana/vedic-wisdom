Dear Learned members,

Humble namaskaram to all of you!! Although I am infe=
rior to all of you but still 
I would like to offer my two cents.=C2=A0 I b=
elieve the karmic blockages one suffers 
are not tests. The real tests are =
the one that God takes to check on our 
internal enemies.=C2=A0 It is easy =
to tackle the=C2=A0karmic blockage=C2=A0but not easy to pass 
these tests .=


There have been examples where members quoted how they were standing in a=
 stall 
and suddenly a woman came up to him asking for money. We are hesita=
nt to give 
money the very thought what if she is a con what if she is evil=
 minded etc comes 
in our mind. Why do these thoughts make the way because =
of our attachment 
towards money? Who cares give the money and let God take=
 care of it. There are 
similar tests Mother takes and they become difficul=
t as one progresses. Also be 
warned mother punishes those who fail. Hence =
the fact that one need not fear 
mother and keep praying is wrong. Just lik=
e a kid that won't listen until a fear 
is instilled in his mind similarly =
sadhakas won't reform the ways if there is no 
fear instilled in our mind. =
Hence fear is needed,=C2=A0Keep praying her with 
devotion, 100% surrender=
=C2=A0to her at the same time fight the internal enemies=C2=A0is 
what I ha=
ve learned so far. 


Also I disagree with the fact that one should ignore =
the tests. These tests are 
similar to the one we take in college exams. On=
e has to be prepared for it 
mentally. Without preparation one will keep fa=
iling and make no progress. 


Coming to the point why tests are needed ...=
they are needed to cleanse our 
souls.=C2=A0Only with soul cleansing one ca=
n come=C2=A0closer to God. =C2=A0

Like I said I am very inferior in my thi=
nking and maybe wrong. Hence kindly 
don't take my words as disrespectful b=
ut its just my opinion and members may 
feel free to correct my thinking. 
=


Thanks and Regards,
Priya

=C2=A0 
Dear KK and All

Thank you very =
much for agreeing with my small explanation about "test" by 
Shakthi.
To pu=
t more more clearly, one performs the spiritual sadhana keeping in mind=C2=
=A0 
one's
"ishta devata" to enhance one's soul to the higher self.=C2=A0 I=
t is only fringe 
benefits if one
come across materialistic benefits in the=
 process.=C2=A0 The main aim and success is 
only to enhance one's soul to =
the higher plane.=C2=A0 Any test or sufferings by the 
physical body in no =
way affect the enhancement of the soul.=C2=A0 The physical body 
suffers be=
cause the Karma
one has done.=C2=A0 But it is to be understood, any spritua=
l sadhana has got great 
potential
not only to enhance the soul; but also b=
estow the materialistic benefits, just 
like that.

Hence it is absolutely =
necessary to continue the spiritual process instead of 
diverting the 

ene=
rgies by thinking about 'test' and 'problems which will automatically grant=
 
the material
benefits also.

With love
SS

<TD vAlign=3Dtop>Dear All<BR><BR>According to me, Shakthi worsh=
ip is the most appropriate for the present day.  Our legends say that =
Devi Parasakthi gives powers to the trinity to perform their duties and she=
 is absolute Power.  Hence Shakthi worship is the most purest form of =
worship and this sadhana elevates one both spiritually and materially. =
; <BR><BR>Regarding the 'test' by the Parasakthi one goes through, if it is=
 some temporary sufferings one go through, according to me, does not the 't=
est' by Sakthi as one perceive because, she is the Mother of all and no Mot=
her will 'test' their children.  SHE Loves all and bestow all that one=
 need irrespectively.  It is to be perceived that the sufferings one u=
ndergoes during the Sadhana is only to cross our limitations and hurdles an=
d with devotion and pure bhakthi and Sadhana one can overcome all these.<BR=
