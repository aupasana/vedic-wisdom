namaste,

I was reflecting on the story of Valmiki and how he came out of a=
n
ant-hill and became a Brahmarshi. The web of initiation-in-name-only,
sAd=
hana, and true-initiation are described there in allegorical terms.
This ap=
pears, to me, to be yet another story chock full of meaning.

The english t=
ranslation of the story is available here --
http://rajunaryanaswamy.blogsp=
ot.com/2010/07/maharishi-valmiki.html
There are many variations of the stor=
y. If any of you can share the
details of the "original" story, and where t=
o find it (ramayana,
mahabharata, puranas), I would appreciate it.

bhavadi=
iyaH,

      ajit


> (2a) As in the analogy I gave earlier, a rich father =
may open a bank account in a son's name with a starting balance of one mill=
ion dollars. Similarly, a guru with some achievement in a mantra can transf=
er some of it to a disciple. However, one without a rich father is still be=
tter off opening a bank account with a zero balance and building it up slow=
ly with one's own hard work. Similarly, one not finding a guru can still do=
 sadhana with famous mantras and build one's own spiritual account. If you =
find a guru to initiate you (not as a formality, but truly initiate you), g=
et initiated. Otherwise, just go ahead and do it.
