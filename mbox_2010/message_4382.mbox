Hi All,

I have been observing a fast on Ekadashi for quite some time now. =
My mind has come up with following queries regarding Vratam with Ekadashi V=
ratam in particular. Can someone please answer the following: -

- I consid=
er "Vratam" as "Sankalpam" (Means a Vow) and not mainly "Upwaas" (Which mea=
ns bowls empty). And I observe Ekadashi Vratam as Falaahar Vratam i.e. Vow =
to sustain myself on Fruits mainly. At the same time, I observe it as a Upw=
aas in the sense that I eat only two times a day, thereby, keeping my bowls=
 empty for most of the time. Is this the right way of doing Ekadashi Vratam=
?

- Also, there is an ambiguity about Udaya Tithi. For Example, Ekadashi i=
n India starts this noon and remains till tomorrow noon or so. But, since E=
kadashi will be the Tithi per tomorrow's sunrise, Tomorrow is recommended f=
or Vratam by Panchangas. I am not sure if this sampling (or synchronisation=
) by sunrise (clock) of the tithi (data) comes from ancient texts or some r=
ecent modifications have brought this concept. This becomes specifically am=
biguous when Ekadashi happens to begin just after one sunrise (hold violati=
on) and ends few minutes after the next sunrise. Per Udaya Tithi, Ekadashi =
will be the next day, although all the conjuct (in degrees from 120 or 240 =
to 132 or 252 so) has lost its impact by that time.
Can someone please clar=
ify?

- For me, Ekadashi is the day when Sun and Moon are in trines i.e. Ou=
r mind has close trinal conjunct with our soul. That is how this is an ausp=
icious day. Now, based on Udaya tithi, Ekadashi is celebrated on the day wh=
en at sunrise, Sun is in Lagna and Moon is in any of the trines. Thus, on t=
he sunrise, it is auspicious with Sun, Moon and Lagna all being in auspicio=
us positions. But, does that make that whole day auspicious enough for Vrat=
am?

-  Any specific Homams that can be done on Ekadashi to boost your spir=
itual progress?

- Any specific Mantras?

I have more questions which I wil=
l try ask as and when my understanding of these things get better.

Best Re=
gards,
Sriram
