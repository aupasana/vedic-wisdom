Another misleading writeup from Shri Balaram Reddy. It conveys a message as=
 if Sri Aurobindo and the Mother were looking for disciples and were all ou=
t to "get" Ganapathi Muni to their Ashram!

What a distortion of truth from=
 a person considered to be a close disciple of Ramana Maharishi and former =
disciple of the Mother and Sri Aurobindo!!

In Sri Aurobindo Ashram, the fa=
cilities a visitor or member would get depended on their inner evolution. I=
f they had a chance of expansion in an artistic field say they had a fine s=
ense of beauty or music, etc., they would be provided a large room with pos=
sibility of practicing their passion and the Mothers Force would work throu=
gh them as they work on their art and their Spiritual evolution would happe=
n that way. It has nothing to do with "getting" people. The number of famou=
s & "powerful" devotees refused permission to stay permanently in the Ashra=
m was much higher than those that were allowed to stay.

What a contrast be=
tween Kapali Shastri and Balaram Reddy! Kapali Shastri left Ramana Maharish=
i & Ganapati Muni to come to Sri Aurobindo and the Mother. But he never mis=
represented Ramanashram or Ramana Maharishi by speaking out his "assumption=
s" as facts.
