Dear Members,
After a lot of deliberation, I decided to write this note to =
share an experience with the members on this forum - hoping that doing so w=
ould elicit some feedback in the form of further guidance.  

I am a studen=
t of Vipassana and have been doing homam (mostly Agnihotra and very recentl=
y started a simple version of Durga Homam) 'almost' regularly for a year no=
w. And I have been reading the posts on this forum with much awe and intere=
st. 

On the 28th of Jan, my father passed away peacefully (after strugglin=
g with renal failure and other complications) at our home in Hyderabad. Whe=
n we were taking my father's body to the smashaan bhoomi for final rites, m=
y mind was constantly reminded of the brilliant notes(Ram naam satya hai - =
1/2/3) written by Rajarshi (detailing his experience of doing a Chandi Homa=
m on a funeral pyre in Kashi with Manish-ji), and I started wondering if I =
would get to see some Aghoris in the smashaan bhumi at Hyd. I thought how w=
onderful it would be, if an Aghori performs a homam on my dad's funeral - s=
o that he would also attain some punya (as per the note). And then immediat=
ely, I had an intense desire to perform a similar homam by myself, but I qu=
ickly reminded myself that I must be kidding to even think that I can do su=
ch a feat. As we descended the steps of the smashaan bhumi, I started exper=
iencing intensely subtle sensations all over my body...especially in/around=
 the abdominal region. As taught in Vipassana, I 'watched' the sensations a=
s equanimously as I could, and told myself that 'even this would change'. S=
oon after, a thought came to my mind, that it is all at the level of the mi=
nd, and may be I should perform a mini version of Chandi Homam in my mental=
 imagery. But I still wanted to have a tangible element to it, so I asked a=
 friend, if he could procure some black sesame seeds and jaggery (now when =
I think of it, this friend was not even baffled at my request) - and he wen=
t away saying he would try and returned back in 10 minutes with the above 2=
 things and in addition he bought some ghee. 

It was my first time at a sm=
ashaan bhumi, and also the very first time that I had seen death/dead body =
at such close quarters. It was a very 'delicate' situation for me, but soon=
 after the fire was ignited (by my eldest brother - exactly at sunset time)=
, I composed myself, went in the direction opposite to where all the friend=
s/relatives were standing and sat down on a stone platform in sukhaasana. I=
 asked my cousin and my nephew to sit on either side, told them that I woul=
d like to meditate, and requested them to let me know if 'something' happen=
s. I had already observed a brown colored dog (thanks to the vivid descript=
ion in Rajarshi's notes) as we reached the funeral-pyre platform, so I thin=
k, I was expecting the dog to behave a little differently (silly me!!):). 
=

I closed my eyes - thanked Mother Earth, my parents, my grandparents, the =
Gods and the Rishis; and seeked their support and blessings in my very firs=
t attempt in doing such a ritual. Being a Vipassana meditator, I am used to=
 focussing on breath, and I saw my breathing was a little fast. I continued=
 watching my breath for few minutes and soon, I was centred enough. I remem=
bered the warning that this should be done ONLY and ONLY with the purest in=
tention of gaining spiritual progress; so I inspected my mind and found the=
 truth to be different. I had a deep desire that my father accumulates some=
 'punya' so that his journey in the non-physical plane is 'mangalmayee'. I =
inspected further and felt that there was some thrill/excitement too in my =
mind about attempting such a unconventional thing. I did not want to give-u=
p, so I mentally surrendered myself and said "this is the truth Maa, I am n=
ot a true seeker, I have mundane desires. Everytime I have done homam in th=
e past, I have asked you to purify my mind, because I have believed and sti=
ll believe that it won't be good to ask for purification/nullification of m=
y past karmas, if I continue generating new ones at the same speed. Today a=
s well, I ask you to purify my impure mind. The impure mind that I have, ha=
s this mundane desire that his father attains some punya and his journey ah=
ead is peaceful. I am sincere, when I tell this to you Maa, so please accep=
t my impurities and my ignorance and let me do this homam. Please pardon th=
is son of yours if he is doing something wrong". 

After this mental dialog=
ue, I though of invoking Durga on the funeral pyre (even though I thought a=
bout Maa Kali/Smashan Kali etc etc) purely because the ONLY Devi mantra tha=
t I am a little comfortable with is a Durga Mantra. In my mind, I said, ALL=
 are forms of one and the same DeviShakti, and it should not really matter,=
 which Devi form I invoke. But then I could not just visualise Maa Durga an=
d instead saw a cloud-like pattern, purple in colour, and fully occupying m=
y mental imagery. I thought of my father - and was trying to co-relate that=
 with the colour of gangrene which had developed in his feet, but the purpl=
e was different, and immediately a thought sprung in my mind associating th=
at colour with the colour of Maa Chandi who wears 'skeletal jewellery' (NOT=
 trying to be funny) and I said, aah..okay..so this is the form of Maa whic=
h has arrived. I did mental Namaskar to Maa Chandi, repeated mentally the t=
houghts about the desire and surrendering of my ignorance. I sought permiss=
ion from the deity to use a Durga mantra by explaning the context. I also r=
emember clearly, that I was a little scared too, and I told Maa to be kind,=
 and to NOT give me any results if she didnt deem me to be fit, but to defi=
netely NOT punish me in any way for doing this.

I had a small mental dialo=
gue with my father, wherein I briefed him about what I was going to do, and=
 I seeked his permission, forgiveness and blessings. 

And then I started m=
y mantra chanting (with swaha) - and tried visualising that I was offering =
something in the pyre. I could not actually visualise any offerings taking =
place - but I still continued with the swaha at the end of the mantra for a=
 while, and then switched to a mantra-japam without the swaha at the end. T=
hrough out I was fully aware of the visualisation of Maa Chandi standing on=
 my dad's funeral. Sometimes, I would visualise her lifting her feet altern=
atively, as if she was crushing something. A few minutes later, I felt the =
Devi removed a feet or a wooden log - and threw it at a little distance in =
the direction which was opposite to mine. I think about five/ten minutes la=
ter, I became a little curious and wanted to see if the dog had come and wa=
s sitting somewhere around. I opened my eyes, and did NOT find the dog. I w=
as not disappointed, but I told myself, it was silly of me to think I would=
 be able to invite the deity, but nevertheless I continued. Few minutes lat=
er, I heard some sound of wings fluttering and opened my eyes to see a shin=
ing black hen (I think it was a rooster, as it had a small, but bright red =
hood/crown). It had come from the piece of land next to the smashaan bhumi =
(either a graveyard or a temple - am not sure) after descending from a 6ft =
boundary wall. It came close to the burning funeral and started jumping and=
 moving around the funeral. It seemed as if the hen wanted to jump inside t=
he funeral and die. Another second it felt, perhaps the hen was acting stra=
nge because it was amused with the fire particles (which looked like 'jugnu=
s') falling down on the earth, as a result of the funeral fire hitting the =
cement roof of the funeral platform. I watched the bird for few minutes, la=
ughed at myself, thinking a black hen came instead of a dog, but neverthele=
ss I said I would continue until it is time for us to leave. I asked my cou=
sin and he said 30 more minutes. So I continued the mental chanting. 

And =
then my cousin signalled me that it was time for everyone to leave. I waite=
d for everyone to start walking towards the exit, mixed the black sesame se=
eds, jaggery and ghee in the plastic packet itself, and walked towards the =
funeral. I seeked forgivess from Maa for my impudence and asked her to acce=
pt my offerings. I had offered only three times, and it was sooooo hot that=
 I could not stand closer and started wondering how far did Manish and Raja=
rshi sit to offer the samagri into the fire? Another cousin of mine, shoute=
d my name from behind, and asked me to hurry up and join them, and even tho=
ugh it was dark and he would not have seen exactly what was happening, I wa=
s a little scared because I did not want anyone to know that I had 'Aghori'=
 tendencies, I quickly stepped back, emptied the contents of the packets in=
 both my hands, apologised to the Devi again for my impudence and requested=
 her to accept this final offering and threw it at the funeral pyre from a =
distance. I thanked her once again and requested her to simply do the needf=
ul and then thanked everyone (including the yahoo group and Rajashri/Manish=
/PVR) and quickly walked and joined the group. 

When I was washing my hand=
s and feet at the well, I looked at the funeral and now there was a red tin=
ge to the fire, which was not there before (could be because of black sesam=
e seeds or jaggery??). 

On the way back home and for the entire evening, I=
 felt very very very quiet within. I would'nt say that I felt a sense of ac=
hievement, because the thought of what happened was not strong in my mind. =
I had neither forgotten, nor was I thinking about 'it'. There was a certian=
 stillness within my existence that evening. I watched my breath as much as=
 I could. No judgement, no questions, just a sense of 'wonder'. The visuali=
sations could have been a product of my own imagination - but the silence w=
as real. And this experience of silence was the most beautiful thing. 

The=
 next day, I heard my brother tell my uncle that he had witnessed many fire=
s, but the one yesterday seemed too big and somewhat special. I wondered if=
 my brother was speaking out of 'perception' or love for our father.

Now t=
hat it is few days since that incident, I have questions like - is the hen =
too, as sensitive as a dog is? Why was it jumping 'madly' around the fire? =
Is there a connection between the hen and the fact that in Hyd, people perf=
orm hen-sacrifice at Shakti/Maa temples? Did Shakti really grant some 'puny=
a' to my dad? If it did, then why did I visualise my dad crawl and climb (a=
s opposed to climbing on two feet) a half-constructed building the next day=
 when I was channeling some reiki to him? 

I am not sure if these question=
s can be answered or if they should be answered at all, but based on the ab=
ove experience, if anyone has any input/lessons/guidance/teachings, I would=
 be most appreciative.

Thank you PVR/Manish and Rajarshi for the continued=
 inspiration. 

Also, apologies for the length of the note.


Regards
Shara=
