Biswajit,

Ideally one can offer any vedic/puranic mantra of any deity whil=
e doing the homam. Read the mantra add Om Swaahaa at the end and offer ahut=
i. There is no problem with this normally.

How ever, looking at your speci=
fic question, I am not sure, most of us could answer.

Your question raises=
 few doubts on your intent. If your wife is destroying every thing in your =
life, what is that you want to achieve by offering some additional mantras =
in homam. In some corner of your mind, do you wish to destroy her so that s=
he can no longer destroy. If such a thought is present even at a minute lev=
el, I suggest you not to do any thing. As Narasimha pointed out any the art=
 of using homam for material benefit is almost exinct.

If you want to do t=
his so that your wife's mental state improves, then your intent is satwik i=
n nature and you can offer any mantra for that.

You may mental think of yo=
ur wifes well being and offer mRtyunjaya mantra along with black sesame see=
ds. (Or any other mantra).

Best regards,
Vijay
