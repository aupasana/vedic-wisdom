Eternity, Being, and Becoming



BEING applies to a living entity, and no =
matter where or when that
BEING,  is, was, or will be. Every living thing i=
s A BEING; whether it
be in a Human  BEING, a Dog BEING, a Horse BEING, or =
any other life form
BEING. It means to BE  and to know it. Being exists in =
two modes:
Essential nature in its timeless  Ground of BEING; and in Manife=
station,
or physical material incarnation BEING,  for a duration of Time. T=
he two
parts are never disconnected whilst the second  part exists in Form.=
 
But when the second  part does not exist in FORM then it again returns
to=
 Essence, or Essential  BEING, in the Ground of its BEING, from whence
it i=
s in its Eternal and  unchanging state of BEING. Essential BEING is
in no n=
eed of TIME and  CHANGE.



Whilst BEING is in FORM  then it  is connected =
to its Essential Timeless
BEING by way of the BRIDGE which connects  the tw=
o aspects of BEING. In
modern vernacular the BRIDGE is called the Occult;  =
or the Soul or the
Subconscious. Meaning for the large part in its being hi=
dden  from
consciousness. But not all the time; but whether hidden or not i=
t is
always  working; and it is there for being used and as well as merely
=
working.   The mode of the Essential part of BEING (the  SELF) is the
Mysti=
cal.  Thus the Mystical  and the Occult are NOT the same thing. Or
in other=
 words the Spirit or Life  Force of the BEING  is not the same
thing  as th=
e SOUL of the BEING. They are two things, and two of the
three parts of  Ma=
nifest BEING. But all three parts are connected up
whilst Manifestation is =
 occurring. WE are living in a time when the
Occult seems to be a bridge to=
o far,  and the Essential nature of BEING
is two bridges too far for the cu=
rrent social  paradigm. Neither science
or religions know them, and educati=
on does not teach  them.



But none of this, and the above mentioned two p=
arts, even touches upon 
BECOMING. So, BECOMING is a third bridge too far f=
or the existing
cultural  paradigm. So why bother to delve into it or make =
mention of
it. All three  aspects are three bridges too far for the current=
 time;
let alone the last one -  BECOMING.  But in effect it is all about  =
the
type of cultivation of seed within being whilst modulated by freedom of=
 
choice and actions among the levels of BEING which are endowed with
freed=
om of  choice.  That which each person choose to  sow and cultivate
within =
them will then issue forth ITS fruit, and they and they  alone
will reap th=
e harvest of that which they have sown and cultivated within
them, whilst i=
n Manifestation; and their middle part, the BRIDGE, the 
Soul/Subconscious,=
 will permit of that and make it so. All for the
lessons  of.



Thus, and =
even though it is a waste of time mentioning any of these
parts  and proces=
ses; it is still well to realise that that which you
sow then so will  you =
come to reap the harvest of.  It is  cause and
effect =96 not magic.   If y=
ou  cannot keep that to the forefront of
your mind, then at least keep on t=
he back  burner. The bed which you
make for yourself then you will sleep in=
 and walk  with. Until you
choose otherwise and take serious action upon it=
. And which you  can do
at any time. It is never too late to change course =
and direction. What
do  you want to become in Form? Until you decide then y=
ou will bob
around on the  waves of spacetime with no rudder and no wind in=
 your
sail; as if in a fog in  the doldrums.  So DECIDE.
