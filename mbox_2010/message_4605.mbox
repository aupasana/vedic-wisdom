Hemanth ji

The Lord of the southern direction is Yama so it is the natural=
 direction to keep the body after death. Also the toes of the body are tied=
 together . Modern mystic Jaggi Vasudev says this is to prevent an easy rep=
ossession of the body by any stray spirits hence the body is kept on the S-=
N axis.

I beleive Vimalananda also writes about this in one of the three b=
ooks.

Lord Dakshinamurthy is the only one among the deities facing south a=
nd the temples of Lord Dakshinamurthy also face south.

I beleive rest from=
 the activities of the physical world is equal in meaning to death. Each da=
y we are reborn said the Buddha.....During sleep the consciousness retreats=
 to the centre of the heart and if restful sleep occurs it is one step clos=
er to samadhi . If one has very deep restful sleep with no dreams during th=
at sleep he or she has no sense of name, fame , family ,caste or age. When =
people wake up at the very second of waking up they have a hard time rememb=
ering who they are...Which is among the states (Sushupti ) is closer to sam=
adhi.


So the southern direction might naturally support the rest from the=
 activities of the world and might not be a bad direction to keep one's hea=
d. Also one can keep it towards the eastern direction as well.

Vem=
parla Ram Kishore
