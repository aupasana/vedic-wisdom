 Every one must have seen the statue of "Laughing Buddha".He is also called=

as the "Happy Man"

In actuality he was named Hotei or Pu-Tai is best know=
n as the jolly
Laughing Buddha. In China, he is known as the Loving or Frie=
ndly One. He is
based on an eccentric Chinese Ch'an (Zen) monk who lived ov=
er 1,000 years
ago and has become a significant part of Buddhist and Shinto=
 culture. Because
of this monk's benevolent nature, he came to be regarded =
as an incarnation
of the bodhisattva who will be Maitreya (the Future Buddh=
a). His large
protruding stomach and jolly smile have given him the common =
designation
"Laughing Buddha."

He was truly a great zen master and legend =
has a great story which is so
inspirational for all of us.

The jolly good =
saint that he was used to go from one place to the other. He
went to the To=
wn Square and soon people gathered around him. He was so funny
looking and =
always smiling that people used to crowd around him.

He would then distrib=
ute sweets and small toys to all children who had
gathered around him. Then=
 keep his bag down, look to the sky and just start
laughing. He used to lau=
gh madly and he was not interested whether other
laughed or not. Soon his l=
aughter used to be contagious and all who had
gathered would start to laugh=
.

The whole town used to laugh and laugh.After sometime he would pick the =
bag,
which he had kept down, smile to all, and go to the next town. All his=
 life
he did only this action and it was said that many people attained Nir=
vana,
enlightenment just through this process.Hence he was called as the la=
ughing
Buddha because Buddha is someone who is enlightened and laughter was=
 his
unique method. Never before him or never after him such a simple aspec=
t was
used to achieve what all humans strive for-moksha or enlightenment.

=
He would rarely speak and once when he was asked to describe his method he
=
told, that he gave sweets to children to symbolically that the more you
giv=
e, the more comes to you. Thereby he unveiled the secret of "Giving with
jo=
y". Children are said to be GOD because they represent the GOD Nature,
whic=
h is always, be in Present time, smiling and joyful, ego less, and most
imp=
ortant is without judge mental mind.

The bag represented problems that all=
 humans encounter. We are mistaken that
when we have problems, that GOD onl=
y gave you a problem and the rest are so
happy. The problems appear big bec=
ause we are associated with it- calling it
as "My Problem". Look at a funny=
 phenomenon, if anyone comes to you with any
problem of theirs and seek sol=
utions or advice, what you do. You tell them
so many solutions so easily as=
 though you are an expert in all the fields in
the Universe. However big th=
e others problems are you can solve it so
easily, you are a master solver o=
f problems. But then what happens to your
own problems. Hmm Hmm it is impos=
sible to find any solution.

This happens only because of your attachment a=
nd association with the
problem.So laughing Buddha said, simple keep your p=
roblem down (symbolically
keeping the bag down) means "Disassociate with yo=
ur Problem", "Separate form
it" and yes just Laugh. What else can one do? T=
hink and thank GOD that you
only have such a small problem as compared to s=
o many others. Whether you
laugh or cry the problem is going to be there ri=
ght. So why not laugh at it.
Therein is the magic and mind you no small mag=
ic, it is huge, apply it to
realize about the power of laughter.

On laughi=
ng your whole internal chemistry changes and thereby the body
produces cert=
ain enzymes that are only released in a state of laughter. The
problem now =
looks too tiny and as you pick it (symbolically he picks back
the bag befor=
e going to the next place) the problem is solved.

Such a great zen master =
was Hotei or Laughing Buddha. So next time you look
at the statue of "laugh=
ing Buddha" associate with that great teaching he
gave all of us, the power=
 of laughter. Each time you see the Laughing Buddha
and if it reminds you t=
o laugh, a great work has been done.

Whole life Hotei lived in Laughter. A=
nd when the time came to pass away, he
knew he had to give up his life at a=
n appropriate time. He called his
disciples and said that after he passes a=
way, they should immediately burn
his body. The disciples were surprised be=
cause there was no tradition of
burning in Zen. But they followed the maste=
r wishes. And as they lit fire to
his body, "Fire Works and Crackers" start=
ed flying all over.

Hotei was so great that just before he died he hid a l=
ot of crackers and
rockets in his clothes. So there also he created such la=
ughter by the
suddenness of the situation.So Hotei not only lived in laught=
er all through
his life, he also died in laughter.

Let us all learn from t=
he great zen master that "It is our birth right to
laugh" and "No matter wh=
at happens we should come back to laughter".
