Biswajit Ji

Even though the question was not addressed to me and am no whe=
re having the knowledge level of Narasimha Ji or other learned members, Let=
 me attempt an answer.

K .N Rao ji has proved very conclusively that the g=
emstone therapy has no scriptural basis in any of the jyotisha classics.BPH=
S does not have a mention of the gem stones at all . The only text bandied =
about as proof by the gemstone followers is some verses from Garuda purana =
( If I remember correctly ) .

Narasimha Ji in his class lectures ( Boston =
group ) has often said Gemstone therapy is rajasic in nature and is far inf=
erior to sattwic methods like mantra.Also the question of if a gemstone wor=
ks for one area ..what will it do for the other. A stone good for career mi=
ght be bad for one's child.One then has to get a perfect stone with perfect=
 cut...One has to energize the stone again with mantra, do the required puj=
as and then wear it.

Even after this is this not like forcibly trying to e=
scape one's fate by means of wealth.Also if gem therapy worked many of the =
multimillionaries who had troubled lifes could have prevented many a thing =
by wearing the biggest best stones.

I also beleive Kala sarp yoga is also =
a nonsense formulated by some selfish astrolgers in recent times to make a =
quick buck.K N rao ji has written many articles on the above false yoga as =
well. 


Learned members may correct me if anything above is offensive.

important note: The power is not in a combination of syllables (mantra) or =
a sequence of physical actions (ritual). The power is in the MIND that FOCU=
SES on a combination of syllables (mantra) or a sequence of physical action=
s (ritual). Energy is generated when mind overcomes its tendency to wander =
and instead focuses on one thing. Different mantras and rituals as the focu=
s points may generate different kinds of energy, but the key is focus. With=
out it, no mantra or ritual produces anything. Focus comes with a lot of pr=
actice. Most priests are just engaging in casual practice when they go and =
do poojas. In the old days, priests did intense sadhana and brought that en=
ergy to the table when they did rituals at the houses of people or in templ=
es.
