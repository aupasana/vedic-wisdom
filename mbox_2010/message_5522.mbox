namaste ajit krishnan sir,

I am in touch with Centre of Excellence for Cla=
ssical Tamil - Central Institute of Indian languages - Mysore and Chennai.
=

They have a CD collections available for the public of superb vocal render=
ing of (1) Entire tolkappiyam and (2) entire pattuppATTu - These are like l=
ullabies of mothers that comnfort the child and teach them language divine.=


I find many so called Dravidian words in the Rig veda for example ANI - (=
common in colloquial tamizh - nail) used as lynch pin in the veda.

regards=
