I have been reciting daily durga shaptashati since p=
ast=A06 months. Initially i took more then one and half hour to read all 13=
 chapters. Now i can read it within 45 minutes. I came to understand that p=
ronounciation of each shlokas is very important. i am sure i am making lot =
many mistakes in=A0 pronounciating each shlokas. How=A0to correct myself? W=
rong pronounciation of shlokas may=A0affect my spiritual progress or=A0will=
 IT=A0adversely affect me spiritually or materially=A0? I have also heard t=
hat reciting chandi path loudly will create NAD BRAHMA around individual wh=
ich protects him or her from all evils. So reciting loudly or=A0moderatly l=
oudly=A0is best or reciting in mind is best? 
=A0
Considering my personal e=
xperience, i have felt that each day i am getting different feelings. Somet=
imes my mind is fully involved in this.. sometimes there are lot many bomba=
rding of weird thoughts in the mind while reciting chandi path and while pe=
rforming daily vishnu homam too. But i ignore and i continue=A0both without=
