This is a great mail and very inspiring. However, I have one question on Sr=
i Manishji's advise on how to carry out the sadhana. He says do it for 100 =
days and repeat the whole procedure for 3 times. So, should we do 3000 time=
s japam in a day for 100 days or do 1000 times every day for=C2=A0300 days?=
 He also says 'Grow a beard'. Now, in a professional corporate life, that c=
ould be a difficult thing. How about trimming it?.... just to be tolerable =
to other people. Maybe my question is silly but it is genuine.
