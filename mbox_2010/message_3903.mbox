Namaste Nagrajgaru,

I remember reading this in a book. A guru says to his =
disciple regarding the disciple's habit of smoking: "If you can leave this =
habit then you need not leave it. If you can't then you must leave it". 

R=
egards,
Padmaja

Such people may lead fruitful dharmik lives. However, Vimalananda may not b=
