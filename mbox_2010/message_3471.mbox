 Question: Why does not Bhagavan go about and preach the truth to the peopl=
e
at large?

Sri Ramana Maharshi: How do you know I am not doing it? Does p=
reaching
consist in mounting a platform and haranguing the people around? P=
reaching
is simple communication of knowledge; it can really be done in sil=
ence only.
What do you think of a man who listens to a sermon for an hour a=
nd goes away
without having been impressed by it so as to change his life? =
Compare him
with another, who sits in a holy presence and goes away after s=
ome time with
his outlook on life totally changed. Which is the better, to =
preach loudly
without effect or to sit silently sending out inner force?

A=
gain, how does speech arise? First there is abstract knowledge. Out of this=

arises the ego, which in turn gives rise to thought, and thought to the
sp=
oken word. So the word is the great grandson of the original source. If
the=
 word can produce an effect, judge for yourself how much more powerful
must=
 be the preaching through silence.
