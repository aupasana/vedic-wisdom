I think one can change his type according to his like
a merchant can become=
 a brahmin
a brahmin can become a warrior
in mahabarata there is instance o=
f  brahmin becoming kings etc
so do what you are fond of and what your natu=
ral instinct dictates

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] karma yoga per ge=
eta

   
Dear everyone, 

I have just realized that geeta in the chapter ka=
rma yoga, constantly talks 
about yagna (homa?) as the main activity and al=
so asserts that whoever is not 
doing homa is just adding his karma all the=
 time. 


For instance, 3.9 states that 

"yagnyaarthaat karmanonyatra loko=
yam karmabandhanah
tadartham karma kaunteya mukasangah samachara"

which ro=
ughly translates to "karmas other than those for yagna (homa) are only 
goi=
ng to increase the bondage and hence you should only that karma that is mea=
nt 
for yagna".

Now this in arjuna's case means that he should just do the=
 war, as that is his 
yagna! 


In my case, does that mean that I should le=
ave my job as a software engineer and 
keep doing homas, and chanting vedam=
 as that is my vihita karma as I am a 
brahmin by birth? 


Verse 13 also g=
oes to say that I am only eating sin if I am doing something 
outside of ve=
dam to get my bread, which I am clearly doing by working as an IT 
professi=
onal in the USA! Does this mean that we should all leave what we are 
doing=
 and go back to our native places and keep doing our kula vritti as defined=
 
by our vihita karmas as defined by our scriptures? I am very confused and=
 need 
PVRjis help to understand this better. 


Nagraj
