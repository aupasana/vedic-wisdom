As Narasimha garu had advised earlier, using any kind of spices like clov=
es, chillies etc should be strictly avoided as offerings in the fire for a =
homam done for spiritual progress. These material (spices) are offered in h=
omam to=C2=A0achieve=C2=A0specific goals and majority of people (including =
priests) are incapable of producing any tangible results through performing=
 any rituals=C2=A0
Hence,it is best to only offer the satwik material such =
as milk creams, sweets etc and better stick to seek (better not even to see=
k anything!!) spiritual progress alone.
ThanksKK =C2=A0P.S: As i read on tw=
itter etc is my "end of thinking capability" :)

      Are Cloves & C=

We had a local priest c=

Thanks in advance.
