Namaste Narsimhaji,

i was performing Ganpati homam till a month ago but no=
w i have relocated for my job and hence i am unable to do so beacuse of the=
 constraints in the hostel where i am staying. So i started intensifying my=
 japam. But whenever i try to do so after a period of time i am unable to c=
oncentrate, the more i try to concentrate my eye lashes start blinking and =
i feel unable to go deep in meditation whereas this was not the case when i=
 used to do homam, that was effortless.
Can you guide me what to do to make=
 my japam more effective.
