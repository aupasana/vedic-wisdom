Dear Girish,
=C2=A0
Congratulation!
=C2=A0
May you be blessed by Her. Compl=
etely surrenderance is the best attitude while doing Chandi homam. She is a=
n amazing Mother. She is the beginning and the end, the source beyond all s=
ources. She is the ONE, by a minute fraction of whose powers even Avataars =
are sent down on this plane.=C2=A0A mere thought from Her can create a 100 =
Vivekanandas any moment. She is with form and=C2=A0without form, she is her=
e, there, everywhere. She is the good and the bad, the weak and the strong,=
 the egoistic and the egoless. She is the real=C2=A0acintya bhed=C4=81bheda=
 tattwa (for me). 
=C2=A0
With such a "being", only thing one can do is sur=
render and submit. Any other attitude is bound to fail.
=C2=A0
Best of luck=
 with your homams.
=C2=A0
-Regards

Dear Girish,


Congratulations on your first Chand=
i Homam. May SHE bless you in your sadhana.


Swami Ramakrishna used to oft=
en advise that sadhana should be done in private. He meant that the sadhana=
 should be kept away from the glare of other persons and after the person h=
as attained a certain stage of realization, he can then talk about his sadh=
ana to other people.


For every one experience of Narasimha, there are pro=
bably 10 or 20 such episodes he has not narrated in public forums. For one =
Manikarnika ghat experience of Manish, there are probably 10 such experienc=
es we have not heard about him.


So bottomline is dont worry or get carrie=
d away by your experiences. As Narasimha emphasizes often, faith, sincerity=
 are the keys to achieving progress. Keep your head level and continue in y=
our sadhana. Ultimately GOD will come and talk with you....thats strictly b=
etween you and HIM/HER.


best regards
Hari

Namaskarams Narasimha=

I finished my "first" Chandi Homam yesterday and I s=

Not sure whether this is how everyone else=
 feels as well. I would like to know the feelings of the other masters in t=

Thanks and Regard=
