 I am now ninety-two years old and I first met the Maharshi in the summer o=
f
1914, when I was just a boy of sixteen. We were then on a pilgrimage to
T=
irupati and had halted in Tiruvannamalai, from where my grandmother hailed.=

We were not strangers to this town.

Some eight years later, I came to Tir=
uvannamalai to visit my sister, who was
married there. One evening, two com=
panions and I went to visit Kavyakanta
Ganapati Muni up on the hill where h=
e had his ashram. What can I say about
that great seer of Mantra Sastra?

I=
 was just then out of college after finishing my masters degree in physics.=

I presented to Kavyakanta the latest views of Einstein, Planck and others =
in
regard to the constitution of matter and the universe. He gave a patient=

hearing, and then said, "Can you put it in a brief way?" Answering in the
=
affirmative, I went on explaining that there is a continuum in which time
a=
nd space are involved, wherein particles change into waves and waves change=

into particles and all can dissolve into a single unitary medium. That is
=
the prospect of the future.

He listened patiently to all this and said, "T=
he world picture is in that
frame," and after a pause he exclaimed, "chitra=
m, chitram!" These words mean
=E2=80=98picture=E2=80=99 =E2=80=94 you may c=
all it a movie-picture. Those words sent a thrill
through my body, through =
my whole frame. I suddenly felt disembodied. I was
myself the whole space i=
n which the pictures were placed =E2=80=94 this body being
one of the pictu=
res. This experience lasted for a brief eternity. When I
came round to myse=
lf we took leave of Kavyakanta.


The next day we had a meeting with Bhagav=
an. This was about the time he
arrived at the present site of Sri Ramanasra=
mam (1922). There were no
buildings at all, except for a small shed coverin=
g the samadhi of the
Mother. Bhagavan was seated on a bench under the shade=
 of a tree, and with
him, lying on the same bench, was the dog named Rose. =
Bhagavan was simply
stroking the dog.

I wondered, among us Brahmins the do=
g was such an animal that it would
defile all purity. A good part of my res=
pect for the Maharshi left me when I
saw him touching that unclean animal =
=E2=80=94 for all its apparent cleanliness and
neatness it was unclean from=
 the Brahmin point of view.

I had a question for the Maharshi. At that tim=
e I was an agnostic. I thought
nature could take care of itself, so where i=
s the need for a Creator? What
is the use of writing all these religious bo=
oks telling =E2=80=98cock and bull=E2=80=99
stories, which do not change th=
e situation.

Then I wanted to put to him straight questions: is there a so=
ul? Is there a
God? Is there salvation? All these three questions were cond=
ensed into one:
Well sir, you are sitting here like this =E2=80=94 I can se=
e your present condition
=E2=80=94 but what will be your future sthiti? The=
 word sthiti in Sanskrit means
=E2=80=98state=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98conditio=
n=E2=80=99.

Maharshi did not answer the question. "Oho," I thought, "you a=
re taking
shelter under the guise of indifferent silence for not answering =
an
inconvenient question!" As soon as I thought this the Maharshi replied a=
nd I
felt as if a bomb had exploded under my seat.

"Sthiti, what do you me=
an by the word sthiti!" he exclaimed.

I was not prepared for that question=
. "Oho, this man is very dangerous, very
dangerously alive. I will have to =
answer with proper care," I thought.

So I said to myself, "If I ask him ab=
out the sthiti or =E2=80=98state=E2=80=99 of the body
it is useless: the bo=
dy will be burned or buried. What I should ask him was
about the condition =
of something within the body. Of course, I can recognize
a mind inside of m=
e." Then I was about to answer "By sthiti, I mean mind,"
when it struck me =
what if he counter-questions with "What is mind?" This I
am not prepared to=
 answer.

As all this was passing through my mind he was sitting there star=
ing at me
with a fierce look.

I then questioned within me, "What is mind? =
Mind is made up of thoughts.
Now, what are thoughts?" I landed in a void. N=
o answer. I then realised that
I could not present a question about a mind =
which did not exist!

Up to that point, the mind was the greatest thing tha=
t existed for me. Now I
discovered it did not exist! I was bewildered. I si=
mply sat like a statue.

Two pairs of eyes were then gripping each other: t=
he eyes of the Maharshi
and my eyes were locked together in a tight embrace=
. I lost all sense of
body. Nothing existed except the eyes of the Maharshi=
.

I don=E2=80=99t know how long I remained like that, but when I returned =
to my
senses, I was terribly afraid of the man. "This is a dangerous man," =
I
thought. In spite of myself, I prostrated and got away from his company.
=

My next visit to the Maharshi was in 1934 on a Jayanti Day. He was sitting=

on a raised platform under a pondal (thatched roof), specially constructed=

in front of the Mother=E2=80=99s Shrine. As the celebration was going on, =
all the
devotees were seated around him.

While sitting there, my eyes were=
 intensely fixed upon the Maharshi and I
saw his form assume different mani=
festations. It first changed to the Avatar
of Vishnu (Vahar Avatar). Then h=
is form changed into that of Ganesha, the
elephant God. Next it suddenly ch=
anged and I saw Ramana and Arunachala as
one. Then I had the vision of the =
whole Arunachala Hill =E2=80=94 the top of the
Hill was transparent and ins=
ide it I saw a Shiva Lingam, similar to what we
see in temples.

Later that=
 evening in the Old Hall I sat at the feet of the Maharshi. He was
reclinin=
g on the couch gazing westward and I sat on the floor facing him.
Our eyes =
fixed, one upon the other, were pinned together for quite a long
time. I th=
en saw the form of the Maharshi take the shape of Ardhanareswara.

Ardhanar=
eswara is one aspect of Shiva =E2=80=94 one half is the Mother and the othe=
r
half is the Father; one half of the form had a breast and the other had a=

trident. Around us the pundits were reciting Sanskrit verses.

In those da=
ys I was repeating the mantra =E2=80=98Ram, Ram=E2=80=99. So I said to myse=
lf:
"Ram =E2=80=94 that is one thought; and Ram again =E2=80=94 that is ano=
ther thought. But in
the interval between these two thoughts there is silen=
ce. That Silence is
the Self." And so, I came to the conclusion that if I g=
o on repeating =E2=80=98Ram,
Ram=E2=80=99 it will resolve itself into that =
Silence.

I was very happy. I rushed home and found I was my normal mundane=
 self,
teaching my classes in the usual way. But all the time, even while t=
he
lectures were going on, =E2=80=98Ram, Ram, Ram=E2=80=99 went on repeatin=
g in my Heart. For
nine years it went on like that and then stopped of its =
own accord. It ended
in Silence.
