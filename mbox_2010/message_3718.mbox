Sri Ramana spent the years 1916 to 1922 with his mother Alagammal and the
s=
mall community at Skandashram. It was during this period that he was joined=

by a number of those disciples who were to remain with him permanently,
th=
ese included Viswanatha Swami, Ramaswami Pillai and Kunju Swami. His
younge=
r brother Nagasundaram also joined the Ashram. When Alagammal died in
1922,=
 she was buried at the foot of the hill. Shortly thereafter the time at
Ska=
ndashram came to an end, as the Maharshi and his followers moved to
settle =
down at her burial site, and Ramanashram,where Sri Ramana was to
remain unt=
il his death, came into being.

As a result of several deaths in her family=
 and the difficult circumstances
of her life Alagammal finally felt that sh=
e should spend the remaining years
of her life with her second son. Nagaswa=
mi, her eldest son, had died in
1900. Soon after her visit to Ramana her br=
other-in-law Nelliappa Iyer had
died and then also her daughter-in-law Mang=
alam. The house in Tiruchuli had
been sold to cover debts. Nelliappa Iyer h=
ad left the family in difficult
circumstances.

In early 1916 Alagammal set=
 off for Tiruvannamalai. As she did not know
whether she would be allowed t=
o stay with Ramana in the Virupaksha Cave she
moved in with Echammal, who e=
ach day brought a meal up to the cave. But
after some time she felt the urg=
ent need to stay with her son. The
community, however, did not want to see =
any change in the established Ashram
routine.

Without consulting Ramana th=
ey declared with one voice that under no
circumstances should women be allo=
wed to live in the cave.Although the other
women argued that the mother sho=
uld be permitted to do so as she was now too
old to climb the hill each
day=
, they remained unmoved. When Sri Ramana came to hear about the matter he
a=
t first kept silent. Alagammal stood there unhappy and despairing and
wante=
d to go, when Ramana, deeply moved, took her hand and said, =E2=80=9CCome l=
et
us go, if not here we can stay somewhere else, come.=E2=80=9D Fearful th=
at he may
indeed go away they all immediately changed their view and Alagam=
mal moved
into the Ashram.

At the Virupaksha Cave there was often not enou=
gh water or at times none at
all. But further up the hill there was a water=
fall under which the members
of the community took their daily bath. Alagam=
mal,however, was too old to
climb up to the spring. Ramana told how he used=
 to fetch the water for her
=E2=80=98bath=E2=80=99 from this spring in two =
kamandalams, =E2=80=9CI used to bring water in both
of them, carrying one i=
n each hand. She used to sit down wearing a small
cloth and I used to pour =
the water over her head just as we do abhishikam
over an idol. That is how =
she used to have her bath.Someone used to wash her
cloth and bring it back.=
 That was all. If water was brought in those two
kamandalams all her requir=
ements used to be met.=E2=80=9D

Kandaswami, one of Sri Ramana=E2=80=99s di=
sciples, eventually found this all too
tiresome. Also, because of the growi=
ng number of disciples,the Virupaksha
Cave was becoming crowded. He therefo=
re decided to look for another place to
stay, where they could live more co=
mfortably and he thought that the best
thing would be to settle down at the=
 spring. Once Ramana had given his
agreement, he started work, cleared away=
 the undergrowth, cacti and trees,
removed the rocks and started building t=
he Ashram. He also planted a garden
with coconut trees. Ramana named the ne=
w Ashram after him. Kanda is the
Tamil name for Skanda, and so the new lodg=
ing was named =E2=80=98Skandashram=E2=80=99. It is
one of the most enchanti=
ng places on the hill with an impressive view of the
Arunachaleswara temple=
 and the whole town.

The daily routine at Skandashram was subject to stric=
t regulation.At four
o=E2=80=99clock in the morning Alagammal would rise an=
d sing devotional songs, while
the other community members meditated.Then A=
kshara Mana Malai (The Marital
Garland of Letters) was recited. Afterwards =
Ramana took his bath. To brush
his teeth he sat on a big stone slab on the =
eastern side of Skandashram. He
continued to do this even when the weather =
was cool, nobody could make him
give this up. Exactly why he did so was onl=
y discovered later. An old woman
was in the habit of coming up daily for da=
rshan. When her health would no
longer allow her to climb up the hill, she =
could see Ramana from her house
when he brushed his teeth at this place. He=
 knew how important this was for
her, so he always sat there, irrespective =
of the weather.

At eight there was rasam and rice for breakfast. After thi=
s the Ashram
community sat outside. Some devotees read, others meditated.Th=
e atmosphere
was very peaceful. Occasionally Ramana answered the questions =
of devotees
and visitors.

In the evening Akshara Mana Malai was recited ag=
ain.

When Alagammal moved into Skandashram, food was meagre and depended u=
pon
whatever visitors and devotees brought. Sometimes the food was deliciou=
s and
there was more than enough for everybody, at other times there was mu=
ch less
and sometimes nothing at all.

Soon Alagammal started cooking regul=
arly and took charge of running the
household. She would wander about the h=
ill and bring back things that she
found there. She was an excellent and im=
aginative cook and liked to spoil
the devotees with a variety of delicious =
dishes, using the ingredients she
had somehow managed to find.

During her =
last years Alagammal still had some lessons to learn.When she
first came to=
 live with Ramana he did not call her =E2=80=98Amma=E2=80=99 (mother).
Some=
times he would ignore her and not answer her when she spoke to him,
whilst =
at the same time paying attention to everybody else. If she
complained he w=
ould say to her, =E2=80=9CAll women are my mothers, not only you.=E2=80=9D
=
This was very hurtful for her. At first this would often make her cry, but
=
later she learned to give up the possessiveness she felt towards her son an=
d
to overcome any feelings of superiority she may have had at being the mot=
her
of the great Swami.

If Alagammal were to think that this thing or that=
 thing were needed, Ramana
would say to her, =E2=80=9CMother, if you want b=
odily comfort, go to the other son;
if you want mental comfort you stay her=
e.=E2=80=9D

Alagammal understood and became accustomed to the life of priv=
ation at the
Ashram. She never thought of leaving.

Alagammal wanted her yo=
unger son Nagasundaram, whose wife had died, to come
to live with them in t=
he Ashram. His sister Alamelu had taken over the
upbringing of his small so=
n Venkataraman (Venkatoo), so he was free and
unattached. She sent one of R=
amana=E2=80=99s companions to Nagasundaram to tell him
of her wish. In 1918=
 Nagasundaram left his job and came to Tiruvannamalai.
First he lived at a =
friend=E2=80=99s house and climbed up to the Ashram each day.
Then he took =
a vow of renunciation and adopted the ochre robe of a
sannyasin. His name w=
as changed to Niranjanandaswami,but he was generally
called =E2=80=98Chinna=
swami=E2=80=99 (little Swami), because he was the brother of the big
Swami.=
 At first he used to go to town every day begging, later he gave it up
as t=
here was by now enough for all to eat in the Ashram itself.

Alagammal=E2=
=80=99s only desire was to be with Ramana at the moment of her death.
When =
her daughter Alamelu invited her to the ceremony to open her new house,
she=
 declined, fearing that she would be unable to return to her son if she
bec=
ame sick there. She said to Ramana, =E2=80=9CEven if you were to throw away=
 my
dead body in these thorny bushes I do not mind but I must end this life=
 in
your arms.=E2=80=9D

When Alagammal felt that her end was nearing, she =
called both her sons to
her side, placed Chinnaswami=E2=80=99s hand in the =
hand of Ramana and said to the
latter one, =E2=80=9CThis boy does not know =
what is right and what is wrong. Don=E2=80=99t
let him go away from you. Ke=
ep a watchful eye on him. This is my last wish.=E2=80=9D


On 19th May 1922=
 Alagammal=E2=80=99s condition became critical. Kunju Swami reports,
=E2=80=
=9CAfter his morning walk, Sri Bhagavan went into mother=E2=80=99s room and=
 sat beside
her. He ate his lunch there itself and was sitting beside her a=
ll the time.
When he noticed her struggling for breath, he put his right ha=
nd on her
chest. She became a little restful after a while. The time of mot=
her=E2=80=99s
liberation was drawing near. Sri Bhagavan put one of his hand=
s on her head
and another on her chest and sat quietly.=E2=80=9DThe devotee=
s had started to recite
the Vedas, Akshara Mana Malai and the name of Ram s=
imultaneously in three
groups, to silence down her mind. At 8 p.m. Alagamma=
l died.

In the meantime Alamelu had arrived along with her husband, her ne=
phew
Venkatoo and some devotees. Although it had been decided that Alagamma=
l=E2=80=99s
burial should be a quiet affair, a huge crowd of Maharshi=E2=80=
=99s devotees had
come, bringing fruit, flowers
and coconuts. A Shiva linga=
m was erected over the grave, which, at the
suggestion of Ganapati Muni, wa=
s named Mathrubhutheswara (God in the form of
the mother).
