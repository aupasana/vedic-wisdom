Namaste,

ing >sunrise and sunset but not at night. 

I have a feeling that for Chand=
i Homam, Midnight or late Night is equally effective. I think for any homam=
, dark and deep night when all the activities of the world are at rest, whe=
n there is a pin-drop silence, when there is no time pressure and no diturb=
ances, one can generate better focus on Homa Agni. This maight be my person=
al liking and may not be true for others though.

Regards,

Utpal
