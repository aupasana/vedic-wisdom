Namasthe Everyone

On the topic of being envious or hurrying into self real=
ization, I wish to
say something that just happened a few hours back.
I liv=
e in Sacramento, CA and went to the Bay Area this afternoon. While
doing gr=
oceries and other errands there, I was reading
with great interest this thr=
ead on my iPhone. I was having similar thoughts
of myself having to followi=
ng the Gruhastha life instead of spending more
time in self realization etc=
. While returning back, it somehow struck to me
that I should visit the Sai=
 Baba temple
at Sunnyvale. I went there and after doing a small prayer and =
sat in front
of Baba's murthy.
My wife suggested that we should read at lea=
st one chapter of the Sai
Jeevitha Charitra copies lying there.
I opened it=
 and Chapter 16 opened titled "Brahma Gyan". This chapter talks
about a sto=
ry of a wealthy person coming to Baba in a hurry demands that
Baba give him=
 "Brahma Gyan" so that he goes back to his hometwon soon.
Omniscience!

Sri=
nivasa

<p>Namaste,<br><br>It is never too late. In any case, =
overcoming ego it is a long process.<br><br>Seeing different deities differ=
ently and seeing them as different manifestations of the same deity are bot=
h fine. If you start disliking people following one approach or become irri=
tated with their thinking, that shows rajas or tamas. If you understand tha=
t all approaches are valid and follow the approach your mind is inclined in=
, it is a sattwik approach.<br>
<br>(1) Well, you neither promote begging b=
y helping someone, nor do you eradicate begging by ignoring someone. Instea=
d of looking at the system, look at the individuals you encounter. If you c=
an help someone and get an instinct to help someone, do it.<br>
<br>At the =
end of the day, there is no universal right and wrong in any matter. In Mah=
abharata, Bhishma teaches that dharma comes from one's heart. The consc=
ience of a person is pure and shows dharma clearly. But, when the instinct =
coming from conscience passes through the conditioned mind, it may become m=
odified by the conditioning of the mind. If one is following the conscience=
, engaging in actions with surrender and giving up doership to god at the e=
nd, slowly conditioning is removed and conscience will shine brighter throu=
gh one's actions.<br>
<br>(2) Yes, such money-minded people are there i=
n every profession, even in noble professions such as priests, Jyotishis, t=
eachers of scriptures, spiritual leaders etc. But why should we judge other=
s? Why not focus the rational mind instead on oneself and judge one's o=
wn shortcomings?<br>
<br>(3) Mind is highly conditioned by duality and resp=
onds to symbols. For example, one may say or even think that all material t=
hings are an illusion and temporary. One may say or even think that beauty =
and ugliness are illusive and temporary and death catches up with everythin=
g. But, can one control one's mind when encountering a beautiful person=
 of opposite sex without clothes? Can one control one's mind when someo=
ne abuses one badly or priases one to the skies?<br>
<br>Theory is differen=
t and control over mind practically is different. To train the mind, we use=
 many symbols. For example, one may see men and women burning on funeral py=
res and the image may stick to one's mind. When one sees a beautiful pe=
rson, one may recall those images and mind may think about the impermanence=
 of body. Symbols encountered in various religions offer ways for the mind =
to distract from negative thoughts and train in thoughts promiting spiritua=
l progress.<br>
<br>(4) Some aghoris, some priests, some jyotishis and some=
 spiritual leaders may be running after money or fame without realizing the=
ir impermanence. That is not surprising. But why should we bother about oth=
ers? Why not focus on ourselves?<br>
<br>Secondly, someone merely accepting=
 money may or may not be attached to money. A realized man does not run aft=
er or run away from anything. One cannot judge a person accurately from one=
's actions. One's intentions and attitude cannot be confidently jud=
ged from one's actions.<br>
<br>(5) NEVER be jealous of anybody. Everyo=
