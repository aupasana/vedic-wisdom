Just to add a little bit here. While we say that Lord Shiva is omnipresent,=
 omniscient etc. yet, if we go through the Pauranic literature then you wil=
l notice that the divine forces are dual.

As per the Puranas; Lord Shiva i=
s the destructive form of MahaShakti in Hinduism therefore called MahaKaala=
.  He took birth from MahaShakti's nitamba therefore he is the tamasik God =
because born from such a part.  The reason of his birth was to create the "=
maithunik" shrishti.

It is mentioned that when MahaShakti had the desire t=
o create the cosmic worlds then she created Vishnu (from her mind); Brahma =
(from her heart) & Shiva from her nitamba.  All three of them were assigned=
 different duties i.e. Bhagwan Vishnu was assigned to protect the world wit=
h his sattviK form; while Brahma was assigned the duty to create the world =
with his Rajasik form and Lord Shiva was assigned the duty to inhale the wo=
rlds with his tamasik powers.

While they perform different duties but they=
 are the merged form of MahaShakti, created by her only.

Thus, Shiva whose=
 birthday is celebrated is different from the one who is omnipresent/omnisc=
ient.

Regards,
Prakash Kandpal
