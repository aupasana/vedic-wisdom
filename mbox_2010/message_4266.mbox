Bhagavan has told us that the world as such is not real

So you and I are =
exchanging unreal information in an unreal world ? Thus
whatever you are sa=
ying is also unreal.

Why would I need to do Karma in an unreal world ? Is =
Karma even unreal ?

  Yoga Vashista says: "All things that exist everywher=
e are experienced
by us;
  there is nothing here anywhere which has not bee=
n experienced by us."

Okay. How does this statement prove world is unreal =
?

Thus scientists are veering round to the conclusion that since every
obj=
ect is a sum of its qualities and these
  qualities are perceived by us, th=
e whole objective universe of matter
and  energy, atoms and stars does not =
exist except as a construction of
  consciousness.

Which scientist says un=
iverse is a construction of consciousness ?

Why does consciousness constru=
ct anything ? Why can't it just be as it
is ? What is the need for an unrea=
l world ?

  I'm just questioning certain basic assumptions of Advaita whic=
h seem to
be totally opposite of what  Bhagavad Gita is saying. In fact wha=
t you
are saying leads to nihilism which is what Buddhists say. If you agre=
e
that you believe in Buddhism we can move on. But if you say all what you
=
are saying is in Vedas , then I will question.

PS : I'm not a Dvaitin or V=
isishtadvatin and I do not want to start
another Dvaita v/s Advaita thread =
on this forum.There have been many
such threads going on on the internet wi=
thout any value.  I just want
more solid explanation if what you wrote is i=
ndeed true.
