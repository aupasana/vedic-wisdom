Dear Sri Narasimha Rao Garu, 

Many many thanks for this invaluable guide. =
I was able to complete my committment of 40 day homam that ended on the Gan=
esha chaturthi on September 11th. September 12th being a Sunday, I did the =
homam again on Sunday (since I do homam every sunday anyway. That made it a=
 41 day continuous Ganapathi homam at my place. I got all the Mantras and p=
rocedures by heart and I do not need the manual anymore for this ritual. By=
 the way, I have a small question. Ganapathi Mula Mantram ends with Swaha. =
So, I have added another Swaha at the end of the recitation for the offerin=
g of the mantram. [following your directions, I have ended the 108 times re=
petitions of this with "Vaushat" instead of the second "Swaha" for the last=
 time]. Was I doing it right? In between I was reviewing your audio track a=
nd I realized that you were reciting Swaha only once. Did I make a mistake?=
