Dear Sharad,
=C2=A0
Thank you for the description. Liked your mail.
=C2=A0
=
Firstly, I am neither Manish nor Narasimha, but just another regular guy in=
 this forum. So whatever I type is from a rational understanding of the pro=
cess and nothing more. It will not be worth much. Still, I felt like sendin=
g some comments.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0The best part of your mail=C2=A0- IMHO - is t=
he consequent=C2=A0"stillness within my existence" that you described.=C2=
=A0The effect a smashan=C2=A0bhoomi has on the human mind=C2=A0can be very =
strong and=C2=A0meditative.Most people would feel a little withdrawn after =
a visit to a samshan.=C2=A0In this world of duality, every place, person, o=
bject has a different energy. The energy of a smashan is quite "unique"=C2=
=A0 - for lack of better words - and it can help to focus the mind. Moreove=
r it was your father's pyre, so that may have also worked subconsciously in=
 your mind to clam it down further.
=C2=A0
Visualizations are a good tool t=
hat many people use in sadhana, but (in my opinion) nothing is more importa=
nt or a better parameter of sadhana than the degree of focus and calmness=
=C2=A0your mind achieves. Even when you do a homa at home, the best part of=
 the homa is the meditation when the purnahuti burns. So therefore, do not=
=C2=A0keep your focus too much on visions or images your mind draws up. The=
y are mostly a product of our conditioned mind. You may not always be able =
to know the real cause of why your mind shows you something. For a vision t=
o be a value and accuracy, one must have a very egoless personality. The I-=
ness has to considerably reduced. Most of us do not have such a state yet, =
and therefore our internal=C2=A0nadis are not cleared enough. Hence, genera=
lly speaking, don't trust images of the mind since=C2=A0these can be at tim=
es self-deluding in nature. Focus on calming the mind, and maintaing the ca=
lmness for as long as you can. That, I feel, is the
 essence of sadhana for=
 starters like me. What you thought you saw when you did Reiki to your fath=
er's soul, maybe a product of your subconscious mind. 
=C2=A0
The fact that=
 you prayed to Ma Durga for punya of your father's soul is itself a boon. W=
hether he actually got any merit out of your ahutis and what degree of meri=
t etc is mere speculations of the mind. A sincere=C2=A0prayer from a genuin=
e heart, at least, will never cause bad merit to teh departed soul. =C2=A0B=
e sure of that much. 
=C2=A0
When a homa is done in a pyre, it is like a fu=
ll normal homa with proper invocations, mudras, a certain number of ahutis =
and purnahuti. It is almost=C2=A0like=C2=A0a homa anywhere else, except tha=
t you are using the fire of a pyre. For ordinary people like me, the streng=
th and effectiveness=C2=A0of a homa depends on=C2=A0the number of times it =
is done and the more the number of ahutis. That is,=C2=A0one good full homa=
 at home should be ideally 108 ahutis or more, or in case of Chandi, the 70=
0 verses. The basic idea is, how long are you interacting with the fire. Th=
e more you do, the better for you. Lesser ahutis for ordinary people like m=
e, may not produce any great effect. 
=C2=A0
Sit at a distance that is comf=
ortable for you considering the heat. Regarding the rooster, it could be a =
deity or it could be simply a coincidence. Consider this example which=C2=
=A0 I tell myself often. There is a HUGE/GIGANTIC cake with some nice icing=
 on top. And there is a very tiny rat which is eating the cake. The cake is=
 sadhana. The icing on top is the deity appearing in some form or the other=
. The rat is me. Since the cake is really huge, I have to start eating from=
 the bottom. I cannot reach=C2=A0the icing at the beginning however much I =
may want to. Once I have eaten up the cake sufficiently, the icing at the t=
op comes down and I can taste it then. Similarly, the idea is repeated effo=
rts, constant nibbling of the cake from the bottom. The deity may come to y=
ou or He/She maynot, but the million dollar question is how are you going t=
o know for sure? You cannot, unless your I-ness has been sufficiently purif=
ied. Till then your mind will keep mixing
 imagination from within yourself=
 with reality from outside yourself. And you will be left with speculation =
and more speculation. The dogs came there in Kasi because Manish was doing =
the homa. When he did a homa in Kurukshetra there too a similar thing happe=
ned (Narasimha mentioned this). From Manish's perspective, he has already t=
asted the icing. So he can know=C2=A0for sure. From my perspective, I am ni=
bbling at the bottom of the cake. I can never know for sure. If Manish had =
not told me that Kala Bhairava was inside the dog, I would have put it down=
 to a strange/curious kind of dog. Nothing more. In such a case, one can ad=
opt two different attitudes.=C2=A0 You can either=C2=A0disregard all such f=
ringe events, put on blinkers=C2=A0and keep ploughing at your sadhana until=
l finally you hit the jackpot with such force that you know for sure this i=
s the real stuff, or, you simply regard everything=C2=A0(animals/humans/inc=
idents) around as a play of the=C2=A0Deity and respectfully
 do whatever yo=
u can. For example, if you are doing a homa and some of the samagri is left=
 un-used, and there is some animal nearby, just feed the animal if it is wi=
lling etc etc. Chose or mix and=C2=A0match which every policy suits you bes=
t. But keep doing sadhana. THAT is vital. Like in=C2=A0sadhana at home a sa=
mshan sadhana too takes practise and effort. So do not worry about all thes=
e too much and just intensify whatever=C2=A0sadhana you can do on a regular=
 basis. Intensity is what makes an Aghori (my opinion).
=C2=A0
If you find =
an attraction for this kind of a path, I would suggest that you start doing=
 Chandi homas at home regularly for some months.=C2=A0 Along with it, keep =
a pair of your clothes which only you will use and no one else. Then, after=
 you have completed a certain number of Chandi homas, wear that specific cl=
othes, go to a smashan from time to time and do the Chandi path and meditat=
e. Leave the rest on Her.=C2=A0She knows best. 
=C2=A0
Make sure that the c=
lothes are yours and no one else wears those in case you are planning to ac=
t on this suggestion.
=C2=A0
The reason why=C2=A0I suggest=C2=A0Chandi (ful=
l Durga Saptashati)=C2=A0specifically=C2=A0is because there is an inherent/=
inbuilt protection in Chandi Path. Which means even if your invocation of t=
he deity is imperfect, merely reading the Chandi itself=C2=A0will bring Her=
=C2=A0grace down on you. With other mantras, there maybe many auxilliary pr=
ocedures needed=C2=A0for a sadhana=C2=A0in a smashan.=C2=A0A Smashan is no=
=C2=A0doubt=C2=A0an interesting place, but=C2=A0there are many different el=
ements present there as well. With ChandiPath, this aspect gets taken care.=
 
=C2=A0
I merely said what I could logically think of. I may or may not be=
 correct. I hope you take this mail in the right vein.

Dear Memb=
ers,
After a lot of deliberation, I decided to write this note to share an =
experience with the members on this forum - hoping that doing so would elic=
it some feedback in the form of further guidance. 

I am a student of Vipas=
sana and have been doing homam (mostly Agnihotra and very recently started =
a simple version of Durga Homam) 'almost' regularly for a year now. And I h=
ave been reading the posts on this forum with much awe and interest. 

On t=
he 28th of Jan, my father passed away peacefully (after struggling with ren=
al failure and other complications) at our home in Hyderabad. When we were =
taking my father's body to the smashaan bhoomi for final rites, my mind was=
 constantly reminded of the brilliant notes(Ram naam satya hai - 1/2/3) wri=
tten by Rajarshi (detailing his experience of doing a Chandi Homam on a fun=
eral pyre in Kashi with Manish-ji), and I started wondering if I would get =
to see some Aghoris in the smashaan bhumi at Hyd. I thought how wonderful i=
t would be, if an Aghori performs a homam on my dad's funeral - so that he =
would also attain some punya (as per the note). And then immediately, I had=
 an intense desire to perform a similar homam by myself, but I quickly remi=
nded myself that I must be kidding to even think that I can do such a feat.=
 As we descended the steps of the smashaan bhumi, I started experiencing in=
tensely subtle sensations all over my body...especially
 in/around the abdo=
minal region. As taught in Vipassana, I 'watched' the sensations as equanim=
ously as I could, and told myself that 'even this would change'. Soon after=
, a thought came to my mind, that it is all at the level of the mind, and m=
ay be I should perform a mini version of Chandi Homam in my mental imagery.=
 But I still wanted to have a tangible element to it, so I asked a friend, =
if he could procure some black sesame seeds and jaggery (now when I think o=
f it, this friend was not even baffled at my request) - and he went away sa=
ying he would try and returned back in 10 minutes with the above 2 things a=
nd in addition he bought some ghee. 

It was my first time at a smashaan bh=
umi, and also the very first time that I had seen death/dead body at such c=
lose quarters. It was a very 'delicate' situation for me, but soon after th=
e fire was ignited (by my eldest brother - exactly at sunset time), I compo=
sed myself, went in the direction opposite to where all the friends/relativ=
es were standing and sat down on a stone platform in sukhaasana. I asked my=
 cousin and my nephew to sit on either side, told them that I would like to=
 meditate, and requested them to let me know if 'something' happens. I had =
already observed a brown colored dog (thanks to the vivid description in Ra=
jarshi's notes) as we reached the funeral-pyre platform, so I think, I was =
expecting the dog to behave a little differently (silly me!!):). 

I closed=
 my eyes - thanked Mother Earth, my parents, my grandparents, the Gods and =
the Rishis; and seeked their support and blessings in my very first attempt=
 in doing such a ritual. Being a Vipassana meditator, I am used to focussin=
g on breath, and I saw my breathing was a little fast. I continued watching=
 my breath for few minutes and soon, I was centred enough. I remembered the=
 warning that this should be done ONLY and ONLY with the purest intention o=
f gaining spiritual progress; so I inspected my mind and found the truth to=
 be different. I had a deep desire that my father accumulates some 'punya' =
so that his journey in the non-physical plane is 'mangalmayee' . I inspecte=
d further and felt that there was some thrill/excitement too in my mind abo=
ut attempting such a unconventional thing. I did not want to give-up, so I =
mentally surrendered myself and said "this is the truth Maa, I am not a tru=
e seeker, I have mundane desires. Everytime I have done
 homam in the past,=
 I have asked you to purify my mind, because I have believed and still beli=
eve that it won't be good to ask for purification/ nullification of my past=
 karmas, if I continue generating new ones at the same speed. Today as well=
, I ask you to purify my impure mind. The impure mind that I have, has this=
 mundane desire that his father attains some punya and his journey ahead is=
 peaceful. I am sincere, when I tell this to you Maa, so please accept my i=
mpurities and my ignorance and let me do this homam. Please pardon this son=
 of yours if he is doing something wrong". 

After this mental dialogue, I =
though of invoking Durga on the funeral pyre (even though I thought about M=
aa Kali/Smashan Kali etc etc) purely because the ONLY Devi mantra that I am=
 a little comfortable with is a Durga Mantra. In my mind, I said, ALL are f=
orms of one and the same DeviShakti, and it should not really matter, which=
 Devi form I invoke. But then I could not just visualise Maa Durga and inst=
ead saw a cloud-like pattern, purple in colour, and fully occupying my ment=
al imagery. I thought of my father - and was trying to co-relate that with =
the colour of gangrene which had developed in his feet, but the purple was =
different, and immediately a thought sprung in my mind associating that col=
our with the colour of Maa Chandi who wears 'skeletal jewellery' (NOT tryin=
g to be funny) and I said, aah..okay..so this is the form of Maa which has =
arrived. I did mental Namaskar to Maa Chandi, repeated mentally the thought=
s about the desire and surrendering of
 my ignorance. I sought permission f=
rom the deity to use a Durga mantra by explaning the context. I also rememb=
er clearly, that I was a little scared too, and I told Maa to be kind, and =
to NOT give me any results if she didnt deem me to be fit, but to definetel=
y NOT punish me in any way for doing this.

I had a small mental dialogue w=
ith my father, wherein I briefed him about what I was going to do, and I se=
eked his permission, forgiveness and blessings. 

And then I started my man=
tra chanting (with swaha) - and tried visualising that I was offering somet=
hing in the pyre. I could not actually visualise any offerings taking place=
 - but I still continued with the swaha at the end of the mantra for a whil=
e, and then switched to a mantra-japam without the swaha at the end. Throug=
h out I was fully aware of the visualisation of Maa Chandi standing on my d=
ad's funeral. Sometimes, I would visualise her lifting her feet alternative=
ly, as if she was crushing something. A few minutes later, I felt the Devi =
removed a feet or a wooden log - and threw it at a little distance in the d=
irection which was opposite to mine. I think about five/ten minutes later, =
I became a little curious and wanted to see if the dog had come and was sit=
ting somewhere around. I opened my eyes, and did NOT find the dog. I was no=
t disappointed, but I told myself, it was silly of me to think I would be a=
ble to invite the deity, but nevertheless I
 continued. Few minutes later, =
I heard some sound of wings fluttering and opened my eyes to see a shining =
black hen (I think it was a rooster, as it had a small, but bright red hood=
/crown). It had come from the piece of land next to the smashaan bhumi (eit=
her a graveyard or a temple - am not sure) after descending from a 6ft boun=
dary wall. It came close to the burning funeral and started jumping and mov=
ing around the funeral. It seemed as if the hen wanted to jump inside the f=
uneral and die. Another second it felt, perhaps the hen was acting strange =
because it was amused with the fire particles (which looked like 'jugnus') =
falling down on the earth, as a result of the funeral fire hitting the ceme=
nt roof of the funeral platform. I watched the bird for few minutes, laughe=
d at myself, thinking a black hen came instead of a dog, but nevertheless I=
 said I would continue until it is time for us to leave. I asked my cousin =
and he said 30 more minutes. So I
 continued the mental chanting. 

And the=
n my cousin signalled me that it was time for everyone to leave. I waited f=
or everyone to start walking towards the exit, mixed the black sesame seeds=
, jaggery and ghee in the plastic packet itself, and walked towards the fun=
eral. I seeked forgivess from Maa for my impudence and asked her to accept =
my offerings. I had offered only three times, and it was sooooo hot that I =
could not stand closer and started wondering how far did Manish and Rajarsh=
i sit to offer the samagri into the fire? Another cousin of mine, shouted m=
y name from behind, and asked me to hurry up and join them, and even though=
 it was dark and he would not have seen exactly what was happening, I was a=
 little scared because I did not want anyone to know that I had 'Aghori' te=
ndencies, I quickly stepped back, emptied the contents of the packets in bo=
th my hands, apologised to the Devi again for my impudence and requested he=
r to accept this final offering and threw it at the funeral
 pyre from a di=
stance. I thanked her once again and requested her to simply do the needful=
 and then thanked everyone (including the yahoo group and Rajashri/Manish/ =
PVR) and quickly walked and joined the group. 

When I was washing my hands=
 and feet at the well, I looked at the funeral and now there was a red ting=
e to the fire, which was not there before (could be because of black sesame=
 seeds or jaggery??). 

On the way back home and for the entire evening, I =
felt very very very quiet within. I would'nt say that I felt a sense of ach=
ievement, because the thought of what happened was not strong in my mind. I=
 had neither forgotten, nor was I thinking about 'it'. There was a certian =
stillness within my existence that evening. I watched my breath as much as =
I could. No judgement, no questions, just a sense of 'wonder'. The visualis=
ations could have been a product of my own imagination - but the silence wa=
s real. And this experience of silence was the most beautiful thing. 

The =
next day, I heard my brother tell my uncle that he had witnessed many fires=
, but the one yesterday seemed too big and somewhat special. I wondered if =
my brother was speaking out of 'perception' or love for our father.

Now th=
at it is few days since that incident, I have questions like - is the hen t=
oo, as sensitive as a dog is? Why was it jumping 'madly' around the fire? I=
s there a connection between the hen and the fact that in Hyd, people perfo=
rm hen-sacrifice at Shakti/Maa temples? Did Shakti really grant some 'punya=
' to my dad? If it did, then why did I visualise my dad crawl and climb (as=
 opposed to climbing on two feet) a half-constructed building the next day =
when I was channeling some reiki to him? 

I am not sure if these questions=
 can be answered or if they should be answered at all, but based on the abo=
ve experience, if anyone has any input/lessons/ guidance/ teachings, I woul=
d be most appreciative.

Thank you PVR/Manish and Rajarshi for the continue=
d inspiration. 

Also, apologies for the length of the note.

Regards
Shara=
d

sadhana you can do on a regular basis. Intensity is what makes an Aghori (m=
y opinion).</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>If you find an attraction for this=
 kind of a path, I would suggest that you start doing Chandi homas at home =
regularly for some months.  Along with it, keep a pair of your clothes=
 which only you will use and no one else. Then, after you have completed a =
certain number of Chandi homas, wear that specific clothes, go to a smashan=
 from time to time and do the Chandi path and meditate. Leave the rest on H=
er. She knows best. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Make sure that the c=
lothes are yours and no one else wears those in case you are planning to ac=
t on this suggestion.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>The reason why I su=
ggest Chandi (full Durga Saptashati) specifically is because=
 there is an inherent/inbuilt protection in Chandi Path. Which means even i=
f your invocation of the deity is imperfect, merely reading the Chandi itse=
lf will bring Her grace down on you. With other mantras, there ma=
ybe many auxilliary procedures needed for a sadhana in a smashan.=
 A Smashan is no doubt an interesting place, but there =
are many different elements present there as well. With ChandiPath, this as=
pect gets taken care. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>I merely said what I co=
uld logically think of. I may or may not be correct. I hope you take this m=
ail in the right vein. </DIV>

<DIV>Dear Members,<BR>After a lot of deliberation=
, I decided to write this note to share an experience with the members on t=
his forum - hoping that doing so would elicit some feedback in the form of =
further guidance. <BR><BR>I am a student of Vipassana and have been doing h=
omam (mostly Agnihotra and very recently started a simple version of Durga =
Homam) 'almost' regularly for a year now. And I have been reading the posts=
 on this forum with much awe and interest. <BR><BR>On the 28th of Jan, my f=
ather passed away peacefully (after struggling with renal failure and other=
 complications) at our home in Hyderabad. When we were taking my father's b=
ody to the smashaan bhoomi for final rites, my mind was constantly reminded=
 of the brilliant notes(Ram naam satya hai - 1/2/3) written by Rajarshi (de=
tailing his experience of doing a Chandi Homam on a funeral pyre in Kashi w=
ith Manish-ji), and I started wondering if I would get to see some Aghoris =
in the smashaan
 bhumi at Hyd. I thought how wonderful it would be, if an A=
ghori performs a homam on my dad's funeral - so that he would also attain s=
ome punya (as per the note). And then immediately, I had an intense desire =
to perform a similar homam by myself, but I quickly reminded myself that I =
must be kidding to even think that I can do such a feat. As we descended th=
e steps of the smashaan bhumi, I started experiencing intensely subtle sens=
ations all over my body...especially in/around the abdominal region. As tau=
ght in Vipassana, I 'watched' the sensations as equanimously as I could, an=
d told myself that 'even this would change'. Soon after, a thought came to =
my mind, that it is all at the level of the mind, and may be I should perfo=
rm a mini version of Chandi Homam in my mental imagery. But I still wanted =
to have a tangible element to it, so I asked a friend, if he could procure =
some black sesame seeds and jaggery (now when I think of it, this friend wa=
s not
 even baffled at my request) - and he went away saying he would try a=
nd returned back in 10 minutes with the above 2 things and in addition he b=
ought some ghee. <BR><BR>It was my first time at a smashaan bhumi, and also=
 the very first time that I had seen death/dead body at such close quarters=
. It was a very 'delicate' situation for me, but soon after the fire was ig=
nited (by my eldest brother - exactly at sunset time), I composed myself, w=
ent in the direction opposite to where all the friends/relatives were stand=
ing and sat down on a stone platform in sukhaasana. I asked my cousin and m=
y nephew to sit on either side, told them that I would like to meditate, an=
d requested them to let me know if 'something' happens. I had already obser=
ved a brown colored dog (thanks to the vivid description in Rajarshi's note=
s) as we reached the funeral-pyre platform, so I think, I was expecting the=
 dog to behave a little differently (silly me!!):). <BR><BR>I closed my
 ey=
es - thanked Mother Earth, my parents, my grandparents, the Gods and the Ri=
shis; and seeked their support and blessings in my very first attempt in do=
ing such a ritual. Being a Vipassana meditator, I am used to focussing on b=
reath, and I saw my breathing was a little fast. I continued watching my br=
eath for few minutes and soon, I was centred enough. I remembered the warni=
ng that this should be done ONLY and ONLY with the purest intention of gain=
ing spiritual progress; so I inspected my mind and found the truth to be di=
fferent. I had a deep desire that my father accumulates some 'punya' so tha=
t his journey in the non-physical plane is 'mangalmayee' . I inspected furt=
her and felt that there was some thrill/excitement too in my mind about att=
empting such a unconventional thing. I did not want to give-up, so I mental=
ly surrendered myself and said "this is the truth Maa, I am not a true seek=
er, I have mundane desires. Everytime I have done homam in the
 past, I hav=
e asked you to purify my mind, because I have believed and still believe th=
at it won't be good to ask for purification/ nullification of my past karma=
s, if I continue generating new ones at the same speed. Today as well, I as=
k you to purify my impure mind. The impure mind that I have, has this munda=
ne desire that his father attains some punya and his journey ahead is peace=
ful. I am sincere, when I tell this to you Maa, so please accept my impurit=
ies and my ignorance and let me do this homam. Please pardon this son of yo=
urs if he is doing something wrong". <BR><BR>After this mental dialogue, I =
though of invoking Durga on the funeral pyre (even though I thought about M=
aa Kali/Smashan Kali etc etc) purely because the ONLY Devi mantra that I am=
 a little comfortable with is a Durga Mantra. In my mind, I said, ALL are f=
orms of one and the same DeviShakti, and it should not really matter, which=
 Devi form I invoke. But then I could not just visualise
 Maa Durga and ins=
tead saw a cloud-like pattern, purple in colour, and fully occupying my men=
tal imagery. I thought of my father - and was trying to co-relate that with=
 the colour of gangrene which had developed in his feet, but the purple was=
 different, and immediately a thought sprung in my mind associating that co=
lour with the colour of Maa Chandi who wears 'skeletal jewellery' (NOT tryi=
ng to be funny) and I said, aah..okay..so this is the form of Maa which has=
 arrived. I did mental Namaskar to Maa Chandi, repeated mentally the though=
ts about the desire and surrendering of my ignorance. I sought permission f=
rom the deity to use a Durga mantra by explaning the context. I also rememb=
er clearly, that I was a little scared too, and I told Maa to be kind, and =
to NOT give me any results if she didnt deem me to be fit, but to definetel=
y NOT punish me in any way for doing this.<BR><BR>I had a small mental dial=
ogue with my father, wherein I briefed him about
 what I was going to do, a=
nd I seeked his permission, forgiveness and blessings. <BR><BR>And then I s=
tarted my mantra chanting (with swaha) - and tried visualising that I was o=
ffering something in the pyre. I could not actually visualise any offerings=
 taking place - but I still continued with the swaha at the end of the mant=
ra for a while, and then switched to a mantra-japam without the swaha at th=
e end. Through out I was fully aware of the visualisation of Maa Chandi sta=
nding on my dad's funeral. Sometimes, I would visualise her lifting her fee=
t alternatively, as if she was crushing something. A few minutes later, I f=
elt the Devi removed a feet or a wooden log - and threw it at a little dist=
ance in the direction which was opposite to mine. I think about five/ten mi=
nutes later, I became a little curious and wanted to see if the dog had com=
e and was sitting somewhere around. I opened my eyes, and did NOT find the =
dog. I was not disappointed, but I told
 myself, it was silly of me to thin=
k I would be able to invite the deity, but nevertheless I continued. Few mi=
nutes later, I heard some sound of wings fluttering and opened my eyes to s=
ee a shining black hen (I think it was a rooster, as it had a small, but br=
ight red hood/crown). It had come from the piece of land next to the smasha=
an bhumi (either a graveyard or a temple - am not sure) after descending fr=
om a 6ft boundary wall. It came close to the burning funeral and started ju=
mping and moving around the funeral. It seemed as if the hen wanted to jump=
 inside the funeral and die. Another second it felt, perhaps the hen was ac=
ting strange because it was amused with the fire particles (which looked li=
ke 'jugnus') falling down on the earth, as a result of the funeral fire hit=
ting the cement roof of the funeral platform. I watched the bird for few mi=
nutes, laughed at myself, thinking a black hen came instead of a dog, but n=
evertheless I said I would
 continue until it is time for us to leave. I as=
ked my cousin and he said 30 more minutes. So I continued the mental chanti=
ng. <BR><BR>And then my cousin signalled me that it was time for everyone t=
o leave. I waited for everyone to start walking towards the exit, mixed the=
 black sesame seeds, jaggery and ghee in the plastic packet itself, and wal=
ked towards the funeral. I seeked forgivess from Maa for my impudence and a=
sked her to accept my offerings. I had offered only three times, and it was=
 sooooo hot that I could not stand closer and started wondering how far did=
 Manish and Rajarshi sit to offer the samagri into the fire? Another cousin=
 of mine, shouted my name from behind, and asked me to hurry up and join th=
em, and even though it was dark and he would not have seen exactly what was=
 happening, I was a little scared because I did not want anyone to know tha=
t I had 'Aghori' tendencies, I quickly stepped back, emptied the contents o=
f the packets in
 both my hands, apologised to the Devi again for my impude=
nce and requested her to accept this final offering and threw it at the fun=
eral pyre from a distance. I thanked her once again and requested her to si=
mply do the needful and then thanked everyone (including the yahoo group an=
d Rajashri/Manish/ PVR) and quickly walked and joined the group. <BR><BR>Wh=
en I was washing my hands and feet at the well, I looked at the funeral and=
 now there was a red tinge to the fire, which was not there before (could b=
e because of black sesame seeds or jaggery??). <BR><BR>On the way back home=
 and for the entire evening, I felt very very very quiet within. I would'nt=
 say that I felt a sense of achievement, because the thought of what happen=
ed was not strong in my mind. I had neither forgotten, nor was I thinking a=
bout 'it'. There was a certian stillness within my existence that evening. =
I watched my breath as much as I could. No judgement, no questions, just a =
sense of
 'wonder'. The visualisations could have been a product of my own =
imagination - but the silence was real. And this experience of silence was =
the most beautiful thing. <BR><BR>The next day, I heard my brother tell my =
uncle that he had witnessed many fires, but the one yesterday seemed too bi=
g and somewhat special. I wondered if my brother was speaking out of 'perce=
ption' or love for our father.<BR><BR>Now that it is few days since that in=
cident, I have questions like - is the hen too, as sensitive as a dog is? W=
hy was it jumping 'madly' around the fire? Is there a connection between th=
e hen and the fact that in Hyd, people perform hen-sacrifice at Shakti/Maa =
temples? Did Shakti really grant some 'punya' to my dad? If it did, then wh=
y did I visualise my dad crawl and climb (as opposed to climbing on two fee=
t) a half-constructed building the next day when I was channeling some reik=
i to him? <BR><BR>I am not sure if these questions can be answered or if th=
ey
 should be answered at all, but based on the above experience, if anyone=
 has any input/lessons/ guidance/ teachings, I would be most appreciative.<=
BR><BR>Thank you PVR/Manish and Rajarshi for the continued inspiration. <BR=
><BR>Also, apologies for the length of the note.<BR><BR>Regards<BR>Sharad<B=
