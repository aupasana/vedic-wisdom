Namaste Girish ji,

Some slight clarification from my side.

Now this "x-y"=
 meat consumed should be compared to what is actually absorbed by 
the huma=
n body. I think it is generally known that animal protein is absorbed at 
a=
 lower rate than plant protein.
=C2=A0
Yes, that is exactly what is called =
the Biological Value in Clinical Nutrition, 
which means, the amount of ass=
imilative capacity of the human body for x or y 
food. Therefore all journa=
ls of clinical nutrition and ditetics carry a BV 
chart, showing what is th=
e ease with which body assimilates=C2=A0different food.


It is a myth that=
 vegeterian food is easily assimilable by the human=C2=A0body. 

On the con=
trary, fish is the easiest to digest for huamans, and red meat 
and=C2=A0ro=
ots like carrots are the most difficult, considered to be negative 
calorie=
.=C2=A0Rest, all other vegetables and chicken comes inbetween fish and red =

meat. If you=C2=A0so desire, I can paste a BV chart too. Science is very c=
lear about 
this.

Don't believe what I am saying. Academic science does no=
t ask anyone to believe 
anything. It only says read the evidence with a cl=
ear mind.

-Regards
=C2=A0Rajarshi

=C2=A0 
With deepest respec=
t I beg to differ from Dr. Bhatla about the "cheapness" of 
protein derived=
 from Animals. 


We have to take into consideration that animals consume "=
x" quantity of veg food 
and convert it to "x-y" meat (y will be due to met=
abolism - 100% conversion or 
more than 100% conversion is impossible).

No=
w this "x-y" meat consumed should be compared to what is actually absorbed =
by 
the human body. I think it is generally known that animal protein is ab=
sorbed at 
a lower rate than plant protein.

Without taking into considerat=
ion the entire food chain (and taking an end to 
end view) there will be fa=
llacies.

Again with sincere respect.

Girish
