Namaste,

1. Regarding =
Krishna and gopis:

The love of gopis for Krishna is not physical. Gopis we=
re re-incarnations of blessed beings from higher lokas (realms of conscious=
ness) and were instinctively drawn to Krishna as they were aware that Krish=
na was the perfected being. They had perfect surrender to the perfected bei=
ng and aspired for his company always.

The story of vastraapaharana (Krish=
na stealing the clothes of gopis from the riverbank while they were bathing=
 in the river and forcing them to come out of the river without clothes) ex=
plains complete surrender and has an esoteric meaning. The sensual overtone=
s some may perceive in the story are an unfortunate side effect of the over=
ly sensualized society we live in.

* * *

Let me talk about the esoteric m=
eaning.

Gopi literally means the shakti that has control over the cows. Co=
ws and horses in RigVeda symbolize the jnanendriyas and karmendriyas respec=
tively. After all, this is the meaning in "Sri Sooktam" also, where we enco=
unter "ashvadaayI ca godaayI", though that line has been superficially inte=
rpreted by scholars as "one who gives cows and horses". Extolling Sri Maha =
Lakshmi as the giver of two specific kinds of cattle would be too frivolous=
 for RigVeda, which represents the timeless and uncreated absolute knowledg=
e rather than relative knowledge bound by space and time. The true meaning =
is that our jnanendriyas and karmendriyas come into being and operate throu=
gh the shakti of the Mother. Anyway, let us go back to gopis.

* * *

Withi=
n us, gopis represent the control over the senses. Control of various kinds=
 over the senses will restrict the sense activity and safeguard one's purit=
y. But, merely by controlling or restricting the senses, one cannot reach g=
od or merge in god. The goal of the shaktis that represent control over sen=
ses is to merge in the Infinite. That is what the desire of gopis to be wit=
h Krishna represents.

Clothes represent conditioning with gunas. Even as o=
ne controls/restricts sense activity, there may be pride about it and sever=
al other types of conditioning that colors the control exerted over sense a=
ctivity. That is what the clothes of gopis represent! Gopis going to Krishn=
a without clothes represents pride and other conditioning being withdrawn f=
rom one's control over senses, one's self-control becoming pure and devoid =
of ANY conditioning and then merging in the Supreme.

As I said, the sensua=
l overtones some may perceive in the story are an unfortunate side effect o=
f the overly sensualized society we live in.

* * *

Regarding all people b=
eing women and the Supreme being a man:

This is also an esotetic concept a=
nd not physical or sensual in nature.

In this universe, masculine spirit r=
epresents the potential energy and feminine spirit represents the kinetic e=
nergy. Supreme Cosmic Being or Parama Purusha exists as the potentiality be=
hind the entire universe. He is the potential energy. Shakti or the kinetic=
 energy that is running the show in this entire universe manifests in each =
person as his/her Kundalini shakti. It is through the Kundalini shakti that=
 one is aware of the universe and acts in it. One's awareness of the world =
is colored by one's conditioning. As Kundalini shakti awakens, rises, purif=
ies herself and drops off all conditioning that colors one's self-awareness=
, it will rise to sahasrara and has a union with Parama Purusha. Instead of=
 being aware of oneself as a limited object that perceives and interacts wi=
th so many other objects, one then is absorbed in an awareness of the Supre=
me Potentiality of the entire universe. Kundalini shakti (one's self-awaren=
ess) is symbolically represented
 as a female deity. She awakens (one start=
s to search for true self), purifies herself, sheds her clothing (condition=
ing that colors one's self-awareness) and ultimately has a union with the s=
upreme being in sahasrara.

All this is symbolic and esoteric in meaning. A=
ny sensuality one perceives in this depiction is simply due to the conditio=
ning of one's mind.

* * *

[Warning: Some raw and uninhibited language in =
the remainder of this mail MAY offend some sensitive and conservative reade=
rs.]

2. Regarding references to body parts:

There is nothing inherently "=
titillating" in a breast or other body parts. When a baby sees the breast, =
for example, the baby thinks of milk and nourishment. There are no other th=
oughts in the baby's mind!

Our problems and weaknesses do not lie in exter=
nal objects. They lie in our own minds. When one sees a luxury car, one can=
 just appreciate its elegance, power and beauty and leave it at that. One n=
eed not think, "I must somehow have this car" or imagine what one can do if=
 one has that car. When one sees a briefcase containing one million dollars=
, one can just appreciate that it is a lot of money and a lot of things can=
 be bought with it. One need not think, "I must somehow have this money" or=
 imagine what one can do if one has that money. Similarly, when one sees a =
breast, one can just appreciate its ability to nurture new life. One need n=
ot imagine what one can do with it. When one sees a vagina, one can just ap=
preciate it as the source of new life.

* * *

Unfortunately, ego and condi=
tioning make one think unnecessary thoughts about every object perceived by=
 senses. Ego and mental conditioning make one introduce oneself mentally in=
 the middle of all objects perceived by senses and engage in mental actions=
 with those objects. Those mental actions are of course shaped by one's own=
 conditioning! THAT is the problem. The over-materialization and over-sexua=
lization prevalent in our society makes the conditioning deeper and more di=
fficult to shake off. But the goal of sadhana is to shake off all condition=
ing.

* * *

When an evolved yogi sees a beautiful naked body, he need not =
close eyes and run away. He need not feel uncomfortable or embarrassed or s=
elf-conscious when looking at or talking about it. There is nothing inheren=
tly wrong or sinful in a naked body. It is not an object of lust by itself,=
 though it may seem like an object of lust to a mind conditioned with lust.=
 Even if such a conditioned person takes sannyasa and remains in a forest f=
or 30 years away from everybody, he may feel lust if he suddenly sees a bea=
utiful naked body after those 30 years of brahmacharya. On the other hand, =
when an evolved yogi who overcame this conditioning sees a beautiful naked =
body, he may not close eyes and run away. He may notice its beauty (just li=
ke one may notice the beauty of a roadside scenery or waterfall or snowfall=
 over a mountain or a sunrise over a lake etc) and appreciate the Creator f=
or creating objects of infinite variety and beauty. Thoughts of lust (e.g. =
I can
 do so and so thing with this body, it will be nice to do so and so t=
hing with this body, etc) may not even arise in his mind!

Of course, when =
one is lustful, the best thing to do is to keep oneself away from objects t=
hat provoke lust. But the final goal is to reach the above state.

* * *

W=
hen you encounter references of body parts in ancient devotional literature=
, you should realize that those authors had overcome lust and were childlik=
e. Talking of a breast or navel would not make them lustful or uncomfortabl=
e or embarrassed. There was no difference between talking about a breast or=
 a navel that they saw and talking about a scenery or a waterfall or snowfa=
ll over a mountain or sunrise over a lake that they saw.

When a goddess re=
vealed herself to them, there was no need to cover her breasts. Clothes rep=
resent covering by additional conditioning and gunas. If goddess revealed h=
erself to one with more conditioning, there was a need for more clothes, je=
wellery etc. If goddess revealed herself to a childlike one with no conditi=
oning, unconditioned raw form is just fine. After all, a woman may feel com=
fortable standing naked in front of a baby, while she will cover herself pr=
operly when coming in front of a twenty year old son whose mind looks at th=
ings differently.

* * *

Bottomline: Those yogis and authors were uncondit=
ioned by lust and were shown what they were ready to see and they described=
 what they saw. Moreover, everything has a symbolic meaning too. However, i=
f you are teaching a young and conditioned mind, I'd suggest not teaching v=
erses that can appear to be explicit or provocative. It is easy to misunder=
stand or get erotic thoughts in the mind, though that is not the intention =
of the author. After all, let me give an analogy. Suppose seeing anything r=
ed makes a person remember a bloodbath one saw earlier, become enraged and =
go and kill the enemies. Suppose you have a picture of abhishekam of a Lali=
ta idol with kumkum (sacred red vermillion powder). You better not show the=
 picture to that person..

Narasimha
