Namaste,

There has been a lot of commentary and views expressed about followers of 
ISKCON.

For those interested in a different perspective about one influential teacher of 
ISKCON; Radhanath Swami, I would suggest reading his autobiography,

The Journey Home - Autobiography of an American Swami.

http://www.thejourneyhomebook.com/index.html

http://www.radhanathswami.com/

I am personally not affiliated with ISKCON and have no vested interested in 
promoting this book, other than the fact that I enjoyed reading it and think 
some others might do so too.

In fact this book is really not about ISKCON at all, but rather a story about 
the search for a Guru and a spiritual path of this one person. It also gives a  
glimpse of the world and particularly, North India, in the 1970's. Fascinating.

On a personal note, I have to say that I was grateful to people in ISKCON for 
running their "chain restaurant", Govinda. I was in a Latin American country, 
Peru, a few years ago and not being familiar with either the food, culture or 
language, it was tough to find vegetarian food. Govinda (in more ways than one!) 
was my savior! In all the cities and towns I visited, this was one place I could 
enjoy a meal without having to worry about, "What can I eat"?

sincerely,
Chandraprakash
