Dear Nagraj garu,
 
Your point 1 in the last mail is not wrong. But, some m=
ay apply the word of Devi to just chanting the saptashati and maintain that=
 chanting the navarna mantra containing beejas requires initiation. Thus, t=
hose who insist on initiation can still do, despite your quote.
 
*        =
*        *
 
If one has a sense of surrender and does one's sadhana with hu=
mility, without expecting any specific results, one is then safe - initiati=
on or no initiation. That is the bottomline in my firm view.
 
The very und=
erstanding that spiritual sadhana is as a fundamental need as eating, drink=
ing and breathing, that one should surrender to god and do sadhana with hum=
ility, and that one should not expect specific results and leave things to =
god, is a good initiation in any sadhana.
 
As one's sadhana progresses, so=
me blocking karmas are burnt by the deity and some spillage during the proc=
ess will have to be experienced by the sadhaka, initiation or no initiation=
. Do sadhana and accept what comes your way as the prasad from Him/Her. Eve=
ntually, you will progress. Sometimes what seems like a bad thing can actua=
lly bring good. We have limited visibility, but God knows everything.
 
If =
you want a slow path with minimal spillage, pick a soumya devata. If you wa=
nt a fast path with possibly more spillage, pick an ugra devata.
 
*       =
 *        *
 
Narayan Iyer, one of the list members, was initiated into a K=
aali mantra by a learned priest in late 2005. After finishing the sadhana w=
ith it, he lost his job. Instead of worrying, he took it as a sign that tha=
t sadhana was working! He did not even submit his resume anywhere, took a b=
reak and went to India for a long pilgrimage. While on that trip, he joined=
 Manish and me for the Shata Chandi homam at Kalikambal temple in Chennai i=
n March 2006. He happened to be the only person present when the Divine Mot=
her appeared before Manish and gave a command to spread simple homam proced=
ures. He had a crucial role in the creation of "do it yourself" homam manua=
ls that are now helping so many people do a homam by themselves everyday or=
 every week!
 
*        *        *
 
Several hundred years ago, it would ha=
ve been unfathomable to find books openly giving navarna mantra, Siddha Kun=
jika stotra, Gayatri mantra, Lakshmi Narayana Hridayas etc. Nature is slowl=
y opening up avenues for good sadhakas coming in future to find out things =
by themselves. In future times, there will be people who have great potenti=
al as sadhakas but having limited access to formal religious and spiritual =
institutions, i.e. deeply desirous of worshipping god but not knowing how t=
o. On the other hand, there will be people who have easy access to knowledg=
e, but not having interest or potential.
 
It is actually happening already=
 to an extent. Many brahmanas who know how to do various rituals are disint=
erested in them and pursue money and fame. Some inquisitive and spirited yo=
ung people who were thirsty for spiritual knowledge and spiritual progress,=
 but not knowing how to do any sadhana, including how to even light a lamp,=
 are now doing daily Chandi homam (or some other homam) by themselves.
 
Be=
st regards,
Narasimha
