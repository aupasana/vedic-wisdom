Namaste friends,
 
People normally start doing rituals like homam/japam hoping for relief from specific personal problems. As their thinking evolves, they think of the world instead of their own problems.
 
Just a word on "peace around the world"..
 
Peace is a great ideal, but sometimes long-lasting peace requires chaos and destruction in the short-term. Rama did not make peace with Ravana, but killed him in a war and that brought peace in the world.
 
We should pray for "dharma" in the world instead of "peace". If dharma is not there, peace will be short-lived.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

I started homam for a better life for myself but soon realised that the problems going on around the world is nothing in front of mine. I started dedicating all my homams/prayers for peace around the world and request others who aren't doing so to do the same. The world needs us and the least we can do is pray.
