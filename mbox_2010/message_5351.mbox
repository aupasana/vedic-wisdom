Namaste Chandra Prakash ji,
=C2=A0
Thank you for response and thank you for=
 looking up the=C2=A0meaning of Biological 
Value from Wikipedia. Following=
 is my response to your post. I would like to 
keep this strictly within th=
e realm of science, which means, I will not deal 
with, i.e, argue for or a=
gainst the ethics/philosophy of=C2=A0meat eating.
=C2=A0
More specifically,=
 BV talks about protein assimilation exclusively and there are 
quite a few=
 flaws even estimating that. Here is a nice journal article (it is 
referen=

=C2=A0
This is more or less a =
correct definition. BV shows how much of the protein can 
be taken and abso=
rved by the human body from an external protein source. This is 
the most s=
tandard accepted and used terminology when it comes to research on 
protein=
 nutrition.
=C2=A0

=C2=
=A0" fish is the easiest to digest for huamans, and red meat and=C2=A0roots=

=C2=A0
Following is the decreasing order of digestive ease:

> red m=

* [it's easier to extract protein from =
egg than from vegetables/lentils, which 
is why it is recommended to athlet=
es -- weightlifters and body builders, in 
particular]
The last variety is =
actually termed as "negative calorie diet" because you spend 
more calories=
 trying to digest it than the calories you extract from it.=C2=A0

Etc. etc.
=C2=A0
Now coming to the following parts=
 of your mail.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
More specifically, BV talks about protein assi=
milation exclusively and there are 
quite a few flaws even estimating that.=
 

=C2=A0
The 'flaws' it speaks about pertain to differences in methods of =
calculations.=C2=A0 
Instead of BV, some researches use PCA, PCAAS. etc or =
PRF. But none of them 
dispute the basic findings of which is the easiest s=
ource of proteins.
=C2=A0
There are two factors crucial in any nutritional =
study. Assimilation of the 
nutrient into the bodymass (like BV calc) and e=
ase of bio-availability. Vitamin 
B12 for example is most easily fond in an=
imal carriers (it is a bacteria which 
uses an animal carrier) to enter and=
 assimilate into the human body. This can 
also be taken in from milk and s=
oya flakes spread. But, ease of availaility 
descreases and finally a docto=
r recommends taking Vitamin B12 suppliments - 
specially for women during p=
regnancy - whose natural diet did not include the 
same. Also our body bein=
g an organic matter and the supplements being mostly 
inorganic, the assimi=
lation always happens less than ideal.
=C2=A0
Strictly from a scientific po=
int of view, I have hardly seen any vegeterians 
being aware of the subtitu=
tes to be taken which can provide the same nutrients 
that a fish/meat/egg =
can provide, not to mention the fact that the substitutes 
are far more cos=
tly and often unafforable for those who are not economically 
well off, spe=
cially in a country like India. 

=C2=A0
The points you have jotted down al=
so state the same thing and thus validate what 
I have stated.
=C2=A0
For t=
he vast majority of the population living a fairly active lifestyle and 
ac=
cess to sufficient vegetarian food, adequate protein intake is not an issue=
 at 
all. 

=C2=A0
The problem is, as I mentioned, most vegeterians are una=
ware of the right food, 
and further, in=C2=A0a coutry like India, the poor=
 can never afford the vegeterian 
substitutes of non vegeterian nutrient so=
urces.
=C2=A0
How many vegeterians in India actually go to a dietetics, or =
even a doctor to 
figure out the correct diet,=C2=A0even though an average =
doctor has really very 
little knowledge of nutrition (which is because nut=
rition is merely a two weeks 
course in a 4 years study). If one has to lea=
rn about nutrition, search for an 
MD in Nutrition and Clinical Dietetics!
=
=C2=A0
So scientifically, a totally vegeterian diet is often an unbalanced =
diet - for 
the reasons mentioned above, and this haas been shown through m=
any tests on 
vegeterians and=C2=A0omnivores -=C2=A0just like american/euro=
pean extreme of meat based 
diets, which are very unbalanced too.=C2=A0
=C2=
=A0
___________
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Dr Atul mentioned that if by some miracle the=
 whole world population were to be 
converted to vegeterians, a protien cri=
sis of unheard proportions leading to 
riots would happen. In my analysis, =
it in an understatement.=C2=A0 To analyse and 
appreciate the whole impact =
of suc=C2=A0a shift one must spend time to study and 
understand the econom=
ic, evolutionary and geological crisis that would ensue. 
For this the stud=
y has to start from why and when animal protein intake became a 
part of hu=
man diet, for which why certain species of animals were domesticated 
and b=
reed which would not have survived this long had it not been for human 
int=
ervention (just like our rice/wheat too would not have survived had it not =

been for human intervention, in natural proccess of evolution). This is a =

=C2=A0 
Namaste Girish ji,

Some=
 slight clarification from my side.

Now this "x-y" meat consumed should be=
 compared to what is actually absorbed by 
the human body. I think it is ge=
nerally known that animal protein is absorbed at 
a lower rate than plant p=
rotein.
=C2=A0
Yes, that is exactly what is called the Biological Value in =
Clinical Nutrition, 
which means, the amount of assimilative capacity of th=
e human body for x or y 
food. Therefore all journals of clinical nutrition=
 and ditetics carry a BV 
chart, showing what is the ease with which body a=
ssimilates=C2=A0different food.


It is a myth that vegeterian food is easi=
ly assimilable by the human=C2=A0body. 

On the contrary, fish is the easie=
st to digest for huamans, and red meat 
and=C2=A0roots like carrots are the=
 most difficult, considered to be negative 
calorie.=C2=A0Rest, all other v=
egetables and chicken comes inbetween fish and red 
meat. If you=C2=A0so de=
sire, I can paste a BV chart too. Science is very clear about 
this.

Don't=
 believe what I am saying. Academic science does not ask anyone to believe =

anything. It only says read the evidence with a clear mind.

=C2=A0 
With deepest respect I beg to differ from =
Dr. Bhatla about the "cheapness" of 
protein derived from Animals. 


We ha=
ve to take into consideration that animals consume "x" quantity of veg food=
 
and convert it to "x-y" meat (y will be due to metabolism - 100% conversi=
on or 
more than 100% conversion is impossible).

Now this "x-y" meat consu=
med should be compared to what is actually absorbed by 
the human body. I t=
hink it is generally known that animal protein is absorbed at 
a lower rate=
 than plant protein.

Without taking into consideration the entire food cha=
in (and taking an end to 
end view) there will be fallacies.

Again with si=
ncere respect.

<P><FONT size=3D5></FONT> </P>
<P><FONT size=3D5>Th=
ere are two factors crucial in any nutritional study. Assimilation of the n=
utrient into the bodymass (like BV calc) and ease of bio-availability. Vita=
min B12 for example is most easily fond in animal carriers (it is a bacteri=
a which uses an animal carrier) to enter and assimilate into the human body=
. This can also be taken in from milk and soya flakes spread. But, ease of =
availaility descreases and finally a doctor recommends taking Vitamin B12 s=
uppliments - specially for women during pregnancy - whose natural diet did =
not include the same. Also our body being an organic matter and the supplem=
ents being mostly inorganic, the assimilation always happens less than idea=
l.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3D5></FONT> </P>
<P><FONT size=3D5>Strictl=
y from a scientific point of view, I have hardly seen any vegeterians being=

es are far more costly and often unafforable for those who are not economic=
ally well off, specially in a country like India. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=

<P><FONT size=3D5>The points you have jotted down al=

<P=

<P><FONT size=3D5><EM>For the vast majori=
ty of the population living a fairly active lifestyle and access to suffici=
ent vegetarian food, adequate protein intake is not an issue at all.</EM> <=
/FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3D5></FONT> </P>
<P><FONT size=3D5>The proble=
m is, as I mentioned, most vegeterians are unaware of the right food, and f=
urther, in a coutry like India, the poor can never afford the vegeteri=
an substitutes of non vegeterian nutrient sources.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=

<P><FONT size=3D5>How many vegeterians in India actu=

<P><FONT size=3D5></FONT> </P>

 In my analysis, it in an understatement.  To analyse and appreciate t=

 this the study has to start from why and when animal protein intake became=
 a part of human diet, for which why certain species of animals were domest=

<DIV>We have to take into consideration that animals consume =

 <BR>> a) Human

s, some four to five million <BR>> years ago, brain size has increased t=
hreefold - chemical requirement for <BR>> long-chain polyunsaturated fat=
ty acid chains in the brain - without a <BR>> corresponding increase in =
the Basal Metabolic Rate. This is possible only with a <BR>> diet that i=

ould not have reached the size and mass as it is today, had it not been for=
 <BR>> diet comprising of meat, fruits and vegetables. <BR>> <BR>>=
 <BR>> c) The gut
 morphology of the human body as it stand todays is id=
eally <BR>> equidistant from that of carnivores as well as herbivores. T=
hat is because <BR>> humans are designed to be omnivores. The lack of a =
well developed caecum and <BR>> rumen, unlike herbivores, makes it diffi=
cult for the body to absorve plant <BR>> cellulose into usable energy, w=
hich is why, a=C3=82 major part of the leafy vegetable <BR>> based =
diet eventually ends up as roughage. On the other hand, the stomach lining =
<BR>> of humans do not contain=C3=82  the kind of strong acids whic=

and carrots. Infact the later is considered negative <BR>> calorie food,=
