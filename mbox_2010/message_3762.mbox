Ramachandra Rao, an ayurvedic healer and devotee, wanted to prepare a
speci=
al tonic for him and wrote a long list with all the ingredients and
present=
ed it to Ramana. The Maharshi went through it with interest, but then
said =
that he had not the money to buy such expensive things. =E2=80=9CIf that
me=
dicine is good for me, it must necessarily be good for all the others
here.=
 Can you give it to them also as well as to me? If people who do
physical w=
ork don=E2=80=99t need a body-building tonic, how do I who merely sits
here=
 and eats? No, no, that can=E2=80=99t be!=E2=80=9D

In 1942 Ramana had a ba=
d fall. A dog was chasing a squirrel and he wanted to
hold the dog back and=
 so stretched out his walking stick, as a result he
slipped and broke his c=
ollarbone.

Sri Ramana always read the newspapers and he and his devotees l=
istened to
the news on the radio. Occasionally politics were discussed in t=
he
Hall. Professor
Subbaramayya reports the following interesting conversat=
ion, =E2=80=9CIt was June
10, 1940. The radio announced the fall of Paris t=
o Germany and the entry of
Italy into the war against the Allies. =E2=80=A6=
 I had just heard a rumour that to
counteract the action of Italy, Turkey h=
ad declared war on the side of the
Allies. I asked Narayana Iyer, who was t=
he latest arrival from the town
whether he had heard any such announcement =
on the radio. Before Narayana
Iyer could reply, Sri Bhagavan Himself said =
=E2=80=98No, it cannot be true.=E2=80=99
Narayana Iyer confirmed this rare =
reply of Sri Bhagavan, and turning to me,
observed =E2=80=98France, a first=
-rate Power has fallen in three days, Then do you
think our Britain can hol=
d out longer than three weeks at the most?=E2=80=99 Upon
this, Sri Bhagavan=
 again observed =E2=80=98Um! =E2=80=93 but Russia =E2=80=93 =E2=80=98 Abrup=
tly Sri
Bhagavan cut short his speech and resumed silence. Neither of us ha=
d the
courage to ask Sri Bhagavan what Russia was going to do, though it ap=
peared
strange that Sri Bhagavan should mention Russia who was at that time=

friendly to Germany. It will be remembered that war broke out between
Germ=
any and Russia only one year afterwards,and it was in fact Germany=E2=80=99=
s
attack on Russia that turned the tide of fortune in favour of the Allies.=
=E2=80=9D

When on 30th January 1948 Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated in New=
 Delhi, the
whole of India went into mourning. A newspaper reporter came to=
 the Ashram
to ask the Maharshi his opinion about the tragedy. Ramana said =
with a
shaking voice, =E2=80=9CFor the Mahatma=E2=80=99s death in this trag=
ic manner, every
person=E2=80=99s heart is mourning.What is there in partic=
ular that I could say? Who
is there who is not grieved? If I say anything, =
you will publish it and
then, one after another, people will come and ask m=
e. What is the good of
it?=E2=80=9D With these words he sent the reporter a=
way and went for his walk. At
half past four the women sang =E2=80=98Raghup=
ati Raghava Rajaram=E2=80=99 (one of Mahatma
Gandhi=E2=80=99s favourite son=
gs). With tears in his eyes Ramana indicated that they
should continue with=
 the singing.At 5 p.m. a conch was blown and an
arati-celebration (waving o=
f lights) was held in the Mother=E2=80=99s Temple for the
death of the Maha=
tma.

After Gandhi's assassination the whole country was plunged into turmo=
il.
There were arson attacks and murders everywhere. The radio in the Hall
=
reported that the situation was very serious. In Tiruvannamalai too people
=
were worried and the town was placed under police guard. Sri Ramana=E2=80=
=99s grand
nephew V. Ganesan reports,=E2=80=9CIt was 9.30 in the morning. S=
uddenly loud cries
of =E2=80=98Catch them, kill them=E2=80=99 were heard. O=
ne mad crowd was chasing another and
all of them entered the Ashram from th=
e hill-side. There was panic inside
the Ashram. A devotee in the Old Hall r=
ushed to the doors and bolted them;
the meditating devotees were naturally =
disturbed. In the midst of all the
tense commotion, Bhagavan was unperturbe=
d, a picture of attention,
correcting some proof.=E2=80=9D

The first signs=
 of Ramana=E2=80=99s illness appeared in early 1949, when he would
often ru=
b his left elbow. An attendant who examined the spot found a boil
the size =
of a pea, which rapidly grew and was soon as big as a marble. Although
it s=
eemed to be harmless it was nevertheless removed on 9th February by the
Ash=
ram doctor Dr. Shankar Rao and the retired surgeon Dr. Srinivasa Rao,
witho=
ut consulting any other doctors. The operation was performed in the
bathroo=
m before breakfast.

After the operation Ramana did his best to hide the wo=
und with his towel.
When people asked what he had on his arm, he joked, =E2=
=80=9CI am wearing a
bracelet=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9CA lingam is born.=E2=80=
=9D The wound took about ten days to heal.

It was not long, however, befor=
e another, larger and more painful growth
appeared. Renowned doctors from M=
adras were consulted and they diagnosed it
as a malignant tumour.

On 1st M=
ay Dr. Raghavachari declared that amputation of the arm was
unavoidable. Bu=
t Ramana refused, =E2=80=9CThere is no need for alarm. The body is
itself a=
 disease. Let it have its natural end. Why mutilate it? Simple
dressing of =
the affected part is enough.=E2=80=9D

The doctors also thought that the su=
n would be beneficial for the sick arm.
So they would arrange a seat for Ra=
mana outside behind the cow shed, remove
the bandage there and clean the wo=
und. The affected part was then exposed to
the sun=E2=80=99s rays for some =
time. On one occasion devotees again expressed their
worries and fears, but=
 he merely joked about his bleeding ulcer, =E2=80=9CSee how
nice it is! It =
is like a precious ruby. It has become an ornament to my arm.
See how red i=
t is! It is glowing brilliantly with the sun=E2=80=99s rays falling on
it. =
Look at it!=E2=80=9D

The ayurvedic healer who had successfully treated Ram=
ana=E2=80=99s broken
collarbone, tried a treatment using a poultice of heal=
ing green leaves. One
evening Ramana returned from his walk shivering with =
fever and, walking with
an extremely unsteady gait, was barely able to reac=
h his couch. Shantamma,
who could not control her grief at this sight, crie=
d out, =E2=80=9COh! Your body=E2=80=A6.=E2=80=9D,
but before she was able t=
o complete the sentence the Maharshi interrupted
her, =E2=80=9COho! The bod=
y? What about it? What has happened? Shivering? What if it
is shivering? Wh=
at you want is that there should be life in this body.Life
is in it. Are yo=
u satisfied?=E2=80=9D Finally he managed to control the shivering,
and look=
ing at the people around him, said, =E2=80=9CThis is Nataraja=E2=80=99s dan=
ce. Daily
it is a stationary darshan. Today it is tandava darshan [dancing =
darshan].
Why should there be any worry on that account?=E2=80=9D Then he k=
ept silent. The
suspicion was that the shivering was caused by an infection=
 brought on by
the green leaves. So this treatment was stopped.

Sri Ramana=
 found it increasingly difficult to climb the steps of the eastern
entrance=
 of the New Hall. When it was suggested that he should use the
northern ent=
rance, where the steps were not so high, he refused, as the
northern part o=
f the Hall was the women=E2=80=99s area and he did not want to
disturb them=
 by entering there. But from now on, whenever he was not giving
darshan, he=
 remained in the small room on the eastern side of the New Hall,
which had =
its own bath. This room became known as the =E2=80=98Nirvana room=E2=80=99,=
 as it
was here that he died.

On 19th March, the Telugu New Year, Sri Rama=
na had a bad accident.When he
entered his bathroom in the morning, he stumb=
led over the threshold and
fell. A devotee wanted to help him up, but he re=
fused and stood up by
himself, albeit with difficulty. His koupina and his =
towel were covered in
blood. He probably had a fracture, but his attendant =
was not allowed to make
it public. The part of his body on which he had fal=
len, started to suppurate
and was very painful, but this too was concealed.=
 That day Ramana sat as
usual from 9 a.m. onwards on the veranda of the lit=
tle room to give darshan.

On the night before the 14th April Sri Ramana as=
ked everyone to go to bed or
to meditate and leave him alone. Even his atte=
ndants he sent away. The next
morning he said in English to his attendant R=
angaswami, who had just
finished massaging him, =E2=80=9Cthanks=E2=80=9D. R=
angaswami, who knew no English, looked
astonished, so Sri Ramana smiled and=
 explained the meaning to him, =E2=80=9CThe
English have a word =E2=80=98th=
anks=E2=80=99, but we only say =E2=80=98santosham=E2=80=99 (I am pleased).=
=E2=80=9D

Until the last Sri Ramana showed his concern for the animals.Som=
e hours
before his death he asked if the peacocks, whom he heard screeching=
, had had
their food. The animals reacted to his approaching end. The peaco=
cks walked
round his room, the cows,dogs, monkeys, birds, all showed their =
affection in
their own way.But the white peacock stood on the roof of the N=
irvana room
screeching uninterruptedly.

On 14th April 1950 At 8.47 p.m., w=
ithout any struggle, his breathing
stopped. There was no other sign of deat=
h,only that the next breath did not
come.

The French photographer Henri Ca=
rtier-Bresson,who had been staying at the
Ashram for two weeks, rushed into=
 the Nirvana room shortly after the moment
of the Maharshi=E2=80=99s
death =
and asked those present for the exact minute of his death.He later
reported=
, =E2=80=9CI was in the open space in front of my house,when my friends dre=
w
my attention to the sky, where I saw a vividly-luminous shooting star wit=
h a
luminous tail, unlike any shooting star I had before seen, coming from =
the
South, moving slowly across the sky and, reaching the top of Arunachala=
,
disappeared behind it. Because of its singularity we all guessed its impo=
rt
and immediately looked at our watches =E2=80=93 it was 8.47 =E2=80=93 an=
d then raced to the
Ashram only to find that our premonition had been only
=
too sadly true: the Master had passed into mahanirvana at that very minute.=
=E2=80=9D

This unusual phenomenon was witnessed by large numbers of people=
 over a wide
area. On 16th April all English and Tamil newspapers published=
 reports on
the death of the Maharshi and also about the appearance of the =
shooting
star.

The crowd of people was so large that the twenty policemen =
were barely able
to keep them under control. Cohen reports that about 40,00=
0 people came
during the day to pay their last respects to Sri Ramana.

But=
 as the Maharshi spent 54 years of his life in Tiruvannamalai and 28 of
the=
m at Ramanashram,his presence is felt there with special intensity.

It is,=
 nevertheless, very important to point out that the true experience of
the =
presence of Ramana and Arunachala must be in the Heart, it is not bound
by =
time or place, and everything else has only the limited value of a
manifest=
ation. =E2=80=9CWhere could I go? I am here=E2=80=9D means that he is the H=
eart of
all living beings, the Self, as it states in Chapter X, verse 20 of=
 the
Bhagavad Gita, his favourite verse, =E2=80=9CI am the Self, Oh Gudakes=
a, dwelling in
the Heart of every being; I am the beginning, the middle and=
 also the end of
all living beings.=E2=80=9D

Ramana describes Realization =
of the Self as follows, =E2=80=9CIn a pinhole camera,
when the hole is smal=
l, you see shapes and colours. When the hole is made
big, the images disapp=
ear and one sees only clear light. Similarly when the
mind is small and nar=
row, it is full of shapes and words. When it broadens,
it sees pure light. =
When the box is destroyed altogether, only the light
remains.=E2=80=9D

nished massaging him, =E2=80=9Cthanks=E2=80=9D. Rangaswami, who knew no Eng=
lish, looked astonished, so Sri Ramana smiled and explained the meaning to =
him, =E2=80=9CThe English have a word =E2=80=98thanks=E2=80=99, but we only=
 say =E2=80=98santosham=E2=80=99 (I am pleased).=E2=80=9D<br>

death and asked those present for the exa=
ct minute of his death.He later reported, =E2=80=9CI was in the open space =
in front of my house,when my friends drew my attention to the sky, where I =
saw a vividly-luminous shooting star with a luminous tail, unlike any shoot=
ing star I had before seen, coming from the South, moving slowly across the=
 sky and, reaching the top of Arunachala, disappeared behind it. Because of=
 its singularity we all guessed its import and immediately looked at our wa=
tches =E2=80=93 it was 8.47 =E2=80=93 and then raced to the Ashram only to =
find that our premonition had been only<br>

too sadly true: the Master had=
 passed into mahanirvana at that very minute.=E2=80=9D<br><br>This unusual =
phenomenon was witnessed by large numbers of people over a wide area. On 16=
th April all English and Tamil newspapers published reports on the death of=
 the Maharshi and also about the appearance of the shooting star.<br>

<br>=
The crowd of people was so large that the twenty policemen were barely able=
 to keep them under control. Cohen reports that about 40,000 people came du=
ring the day to pay their last respects to Sri Ramana.<br><br>But as the Ma=
harshi spent 54 years of his life in Tiruvannamalai and 28 of them at Raman=
ashram,his presence is felt there with special intensity.<br>

<br>It is, n=
evertheless, very important to point out that the true experience of the pr=
esence of Ramana and Arunachala must be in the Heart, it is not bound by ti=
me or place, and everything else has only the limited value of a manifestat=
ion. =E2=80=9CWhere could I go? I am here=E2=80=9D means that he is the Hea=
rt of all living beings, the Self, as it states in Chapter X, verse 20 of t=
he Bhagavad Gita, his favourite verse, =E2=80=9CI am the Self, Oh Gudakesa,=
 dwelling in the Heart of every being; I am the beginning, the middle and a=
lso the end of all living beings.=E2=80=9D<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-wei=
ght:bold">Ramana describes Realization of the Self as follows, =E2=80=9CIn =
a pinhole camera, when the hole is small, you see shapes and colours. When =
the hole is made big, the images disappear and one sees only clear light. S=
imilarly when the mind is small and narrow, it is full of shapes and words.=
 When it broadens, it sees pure light. When the box is destroyed altogether=
