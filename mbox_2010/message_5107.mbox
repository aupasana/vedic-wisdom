Respected Neela ji,

Thanks for sharing your experience. This is true that =
a superior energy is supervising our progress and that energy Teach us, Gui=
de us, Test, Punish and reward us suitably to teach us new lessons. Just li=
ke a teacher in our schools do. But difference between our school teacher a=
nd this Superior teacher is that latter can choose any method or any medium=
 to teach us. And His teachings and tests come when they are most needed an=
d least expected.

When I just started searching myself, like everyone else=
 I also had many questions. Whenever i was stuck somewhere, I was inclined =
to open a specific book or come to this group. I found that the question in=
 my mind was already answered here by Narasimha Ji, or Utpal ji or Rajarshi=
 ji just few hours before I visited, or in the page of book I randomly open=
ed. This is not a unique experience. Many other members in this group had a=
lready written and shared such personal experiences and I believe that this=
 happen to everyone. 

I think that Picture of Thakur ji was method to tell=
 you that He is always near you and supervising you. 

After I sent my last=
 mail I realised that answer to Bhubendra Ji's question of "How to Decode?"=
 is written in lines adapted from Tarapeeth Bhairav. Especially the last li=
ne.

Kind Regards
Atul
