Dear Sri Narasimha Rao garu, 

I have seen the videos of Shri Rambhau Swamy=
 of Thanjavur following the links posted herein. It was amazing to me that =
at this age, people are able to perform such miracles of offering themselve=
s [their bodies] into the fire. I remember reading Vimalananda that fire ca=
n be friendly to one if one starts worshipping with the right attitude. Thi=
s only confirms that. I would like to hear your comments about the same, if=
 you had a chance to see those videos. 

Also, according to our sastras, Sa=
nyasis are not bound to fire-worship and hence they are buried after they l=
eave their mortal bodies, not cremated. Then how come this swamy is perform=
ing these elaborate homams? I am sure I have something lacking in my unders=
tanding.

Can women teachers hold the title Acharya? I heard the term achar=
ya only in case of men from our puranic literature. But these days I am hea=
ring the word Acharya in front of many Women teachers. Is that gramatically=
 correct or there is a different Sanskrit word for the same? 

What is your=
 opinion on Chinmaya Mission? They recently opened a chapter in our City an=
d the organizers are trying to involve me in their activities. Before the C=
hinmaya Mission, I had been teaching Bhagavadgita to a few children in the =
community and hence they want me take active role in teaching at the missio=
n. I am not comfortable with some of the practises of the mission. They are=
 printing and distributing sacred mantras like Gayatri Mantra, Mrityunjaya =
Mantra and so on, which is not a right practise from the traditions that I =
learnt. I consider you as my Guru and hence I take your word as an approval=
 or disapproval for undertaking such committments. That apart, I don't thin=
k I have evolved much to be teaching such great subjects. Even the Gita tha=
t I am teaching to kids is somewhat superficial only as I am only ensuring =
that they are memorizing the whole text and emphasizing on the pronunciatio=
n, without much attention to the meanings. Having learnt a lot of thyagaraj=
a krithis/dikshitar krithis/Nannayya and Pothanas literature, I think I hav=
e a decent understanding of how to pronounce the sanskrit and telugu words =
and hence is the direction of my emphasis. But teaching meanings (literal a=
nd esoteric) is beyond my capacity, I feel. What do you want me to do in su=
ch a situation?

Regards, 

Nagraj
