Namaskar,

   Just a thought on the path of Gorakhnath. It could correspond=
 to the 12 houses of Zodiac in the following manner, since first house in J=
yotish is Ascendant, ruling Physical body.

By following Guru Gorakh Natha'=
s Path,
1st house --- a being becomes diseases free in first year, 
2nd hou=
se --- Knower of all the languages in the second year, 
3rd house --- Recei=
ves Divya Deha in third year, 
4th house --- he becomes free from hunger, s=
leep, cold and heat in fourth year, 
5th house --- Vaksiddhi as well as Par=
akaya Siddhi in fifth year, 
6th house --- weapon proof in sixth year,
7th =
house --- Vayu Vegi as well as Durdarshi in seventh year, 
8th house --- An=
imadi Siddhi in eighth year, 
9th house --- Vajrakaya Siddha as well as Ksc=
har Siddha in nine'th year, 
10th house -- Controller of Air in tenth year =
and 
11th house -- Trikal Darshi Sarvagya in 11'th year, 
12th house -- Equ=
al to shiva in 12'th year 

and lastly he realizes Param Pada Moksha in his=
 Deha.

    These seem to be the siddhis' related to Manipura chakra. The m=
ethod is not known, but could only be related to development of Will-Power,=
 as Manipura is the center for will power. This, is not, same as the "divin=
ization of Physical body", but realization of Brahman through the path of W=
ill-power, instead of Kriya and Jnana Yoga.

    Thank you Lalit for sharin=
g this information with us, as it clears the role of various bhavas in the =
life of a person and gives precious insights. I think, we can have comments=
 from Narasimha here.

regards,
Aryama

vedantins may indeed say that the physical body is an illusion and that it =

 Maharshi Vasishtha clearly says that action (karma) and knowledge (jnaana)=
 are two wings with which the bird of individualized consciousness flies in=
to the sky of self-realization. Physical body is not to be ignored, but to =
be used skillfully and carefully to perform the *right actions* that can fr=

rect knowledge (that god is the doer of all actions!) is like a person who =
is walking around a mountain not realizing that the goal of walking is to r=
each the top. Such a person will keep walking forever and not reach the top=
. On the other hand, one having the correct knowledge but not performing ac=
tions is like someone who knows that reaching the top of the mountain is th=
e goal and keeps staring at the top, without walking. Such a person will re=
main at the base of the mountain. Thus, jnaana and karma alone are not able=
 to free one and that is why Vasishtha compares them to two wings of a bird=
. The equilibrium caused by action and knowledge is what takes us towards l=
iberation.

an individualized *ethereal* body with a subtle ego, even after giving up a=
 physical body. One can then create a physical body at will, then merge bac=

 on. So, what is the whole point of physical immortality?
