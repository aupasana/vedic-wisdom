The power is in the MIND that FOCUSES on a combination of syllables (mantra=
) or a sequence of physical actions (ritual). Energy is generated when mind=
 overcomes its tendency to wander and instead focuses on one thing. Differe=
nt mantras and rituals as the focus points may generate different kinds of =
energy, but the key is focus. Without it, no mantra or ritual produces anyt=
hing. Focus comes with a lot of practice. Most priests are just engaging in=
 casual practice when they go and do poojas. In the old days, priests did i=
ntense sadhana and brought that energy to the table when they did rituals a=
t the houses of people or in temples.
>  
> I did see priests who have done=
 good sadhana, purified themselves and carry some spiritual energy. But tho=
se are getting rarer and rarer now-a-days. One can most certainly not bank =
on finding such a priest.

I have nothing against the "Brahmana by birth" class, having been born in a=
n orthodox Brahmana family myself. I have neither love nor hatred for the "=
Brahmana by birth" class. My only wish is that more people - from any birth=
 caste - develop into true Brahmanas.
>

who is possibly proud of his skills and thinking about money and possibly n=

least your identification with the trouble and your desire to solve the pro=

is no harm in trying.

l you manage with whatever you have? If you just have a bowl of dal (lentil=
 soup) and rice, you will simply eat it. You atleast get some energy.

 Similarly, if you do not know the "perfect way" to do a mantra/ritual, you=
