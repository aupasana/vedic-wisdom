There are some unanswered questions in my mind.

The argument involving Vir=
ya is not satisfying to me:
1. This explanation is explaining predominantly=
 from a male point of view
2. According the modern doctors, whether or not =
you do intentionally or not, the Virya does not stay. It gets secreted any =
way.
3. Why so much focus or affinity for accumulation of energy? Yes, the =
common argument is that we need to accumulate spiritual energy to burn our =
karma. But, why burn the karma? In several threads, the only absolute way o=
f burning karma seem to be paying it up with out attachment. It is all in t=
he mind. In order to realise this and condition our mind, do we really need=
 energy. I trust, what we need is the resolve and persistant effort.
4. Is =
not the goal is not to have a goal? We are advised not to anticipate/wish f=
or an experiance while doing sadhana. Once we manage to do sadhana with out=
 any anticipation, why all this focus on accumulating energy or even obtain=
ing Moksha?

If the definition of Brahmacharya is to keep the mind in Brahm=
an all the time, then our actions do not result in any more karma because, =
your mind is focusing on brahman and hence you do not identify yourself in =
your actions. You do them because you had to do them.

Perhaps, best way to=
 get this is not avoiding certain actions but, try developing ability to ke=
ep thinking about God while doing any/every thing.

This reminds me a story=
 I read in my child hood.

Once Narada gets to proud that he is the best de=
votee as he keeps thinking of Narayana all the time. Vishnu disappoints him=
 by naming some wood cutter as his best devotee. This wood cutter utters th=
e name of Vishnu only few times during the day. Narada protests and then Vi=
shnu gives him a wessel full of milk and asks him to put it on his head and=
 walk around.

If can't stop sex, try to chant God's name while you are doi=
ng sex. If you can manage to decrease amount of joy you derise out of sex, =
then you are on the correct path. Nigraha will come automatically if you st=
op enjoying it.
