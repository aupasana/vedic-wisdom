Religious Recluse Mourned in In=
dia;Shri Ramana Maharshi Was Called a 'Living
Saint' =E2=80=94 Made Abode i=
n Cave

NEW DELHI, India, April 15 =E2=80=93 Hindu India mourned today the =
death of one of
her greatest "living saints" and a remarkable man of his ti=
me, Shri Ramana
Maharshi, who died last night at the age of 71 in his Ashra=
m retreat at
Tiruvannamalai near Pondicherry.

Shri Ramana was renowned as =
a religious recluse and seer whose piety and
philosophy of self-abnegation =
gained him followers in many countries. His
devotees in Tiruvannamalai, who=
 include men and women of many nationalities,
held to their master's own ph=
ilosophy as he was taken from them. They
believe, like him, that there is n=
o death, but that Shri Ramana's physical
form has ceased to function, while=
 his inner-being continues on an exalted
plane.

It was his development of =
this theory that made the second son of an obscure
village lawyer one of In=
dia's most revered sages.

Shri Ramana had humble beginnings, and his schoo=
l record was far from
brilliant. Neglecting his studies, he brooded on reli=
gious subjects. One day
in July, 1896, while reflecting on the mystery of d=
eath, the young
Venkataraman, as his name was then, conceived the idea that=
 death of the
body is a relative thing and that the intellect belongs to a =
power beyond
which never dies.

After a month of profound meditation on thi=
s subject, he left home abruptly
and repaired to the temple of his particul=
ar God, Arunachala, in
Tiruvannamalai. Here he shaved his head and adopted =
the robe of the Sanyasi
(holy man). Soon he came to be regarded in the neig=
hborhood as a queer one
and he was jeered, stoned and eventually disowned b=
y his family.

To escape persecution, the young ascetic took abode in a cav=
e. He became so
immersed in meditation that, according to his own later acc=
ounts, he was
totally unaware of the terrible ravages to his physique by st=
arvation and
the bites of scorpions and insects that nearly devoured him al=
ive.

Though he rarely spoke-but composed religious expositions that later =
became
famous throughout the Hindu world-the recluse attracted followers.
E=
ventually, his dwelling became a place of pilgrimage. In later years, the
l=
arge Ashram grew about the odd man, who made no effort to proselytize and
c=
ontinued in silent meditation and writing. His followers changed his name
t=
o Maharshi, which means great saint.

Here in India, where thousands of so-=
called holy men claim close ties with
the infinite, it is said that the mos=
t remarkable thing about Shri Ramana
Maharshi was that he never claimed any=
thing remarkable for himself, yet
became one most respected of all.
