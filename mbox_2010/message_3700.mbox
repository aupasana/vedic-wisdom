Namaste Girish,
=C2=A0
You are right. 'Paathaantara' means versions. If yo=
u are reading Chandi Paath from 'Gita press' then you can recite the words =
which are written in the main chapters and not the one in 'Foot notes'. som=
e words are diferent in different authentic books.
=C2=A0
However, please n=
ote that the words given as versions at the bottom are also valid one and c=
an be used as original ones. It all depends upon how your prior familiarity=
. For example - In Maharashtra, people pronounce "Sarva Mangala MAANGALYE..=
.." and not Mangalye. If you see in CP by Gita press, they have given "Mang=
alye" in orginal text where as "Maangalye" is given as Paathaantara.
=C2=A0=

Another example - Narasimha recites "Mamatvaakrushta Maanasah..." where as=
 i recite "Mamatvaakrushta Chetanah" - 'Maanasah' is Given as Paathantara i=
n Gita Press book.
=C2=A0
Hope it's clear.
=C2=A0
Best Regards,
=C2=A0
