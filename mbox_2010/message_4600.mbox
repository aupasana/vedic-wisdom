 15th April, 1937

A frequent visitor to the Ashram is cogitating over the =
problem of Maya and
its relation to the waking and dream states.

V. Is the=
re any genuine difference between the experience of jagrat and that
of drea=
ms?

Bh. None, except that jagrat appears to be more enduring than the othe=
r to
the person who is in jagrat, though not so to the dreamer himself. The=

person in jagrat relates his dream to have sometimes covered hundreds of
y=
ears, hence he calls it transitory, whereas actually there is not the
sligh=
test difference between the nature
of the two states.

V. There is this dif=
ference: each time we return to jagrat, we come to the
same place, same peo=
ple, same activities and interests, which is not the
case with going to the=
 svapna state.

Bh. This is because things move very rapidly in dreams, as =
they appear now
to you in jagrat. But each time you go to the dream world d=
o you feel being
a stranger in it? Do you not feel thoroughly at home with =
the people and
places as you do here? Don=E2=80=99t you sometimes dream of =
being a minister, or
meeting your father who had died in jagrat long ago, o=
r seeing God seated on
a throne,etc., without noticing any incongruity in i=
t? The dream is as real
then to you as jagrat is now. Where is the
differen=
ce? If you call the dream illusion, why do you not do so to jagrat
also?

C=
. I suppose efforts have to be made in the waking state, which implies that=

moksha can be gained only in jagrat.

Bh. Quite so, awareness is necessary=
 for mind control; otherwise who is to
make the effort? You cannot make it =
in sleep or under the influence of
drugs. Also mukti has to be gained in fu=
ll awareness, because the Reality
itself is pure awareness.

V. Arjuna saw =
the Divine Form of Sri Krishna. Was that vision true?

Bh. Sri Krishna star=
ted the discourse in Chapter II of the Bhagavad Gita
with: =E2=80=9CI have =
no form,=E2=80=9D etc., but in Chapter XI, He said: =E2=80=9CI transcend th=
e
three worlds . . . ,=E2=80=9D yet Arjuna saw these in Him.

Again Sri Kri=
shna said: =E2=80=9CI am Time.=E2=80=9D Does time have a form? If the unive=
rse
is His form, should it not be uniform and changeless, He being the
Chan=
geless One?

The solution to these apparent contradictions lies in His stat=
ement to
Arjuna: =E2=80=9CSee in Me all you desire to see. . . ,=E2=80=9D w=
hich means that His form
varies according to the desires and conceptions of=
 the seer.

Men speak of divine visions, yet paint them differently with th=
e seer
himself in the scene. Even hypnotists can make one see strange scene=
s and
phenomena, which you condemn as tricks and jugglery,whereas the forme=
r you
extol as Divine. Why is this difference?

The fact is that all sights=
 are unreal, whether they come from the senses or
the mind as pure concepts=
.THIS IS THE TRUTH.
