Namaste,

IMO they are pretty good.They are a good introduction to many to=
pics. The originals of the translations are better though- mostly since a l=
ot of the context and beauty of the original language is lost in translatio=
n in to English( I refer to some of his works).Reading these may inspire yo=
u to read the originals. His books are not easy reads and appeal more to th=
e intellect. They are not useful for enhancing ones practice since they are=
 written from an academic angle. They also refer specifically to the philos=
ophies or guided thinking of certain schools of practice. 

AS you can see =
many of these comments are generic and can be applied to a host of other bo=
oks. I am not saying in the least that they are bad- but that they are good=
 and however they may be interesting only to some people.
