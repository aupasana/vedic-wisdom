 Dvaita and Advaita are relative terms. They are based on the sense of
dual=
ity. The Self is as It is. There is neither dvaita nor advaita, I AM
THAT I=
 AM. Simple Be-ing is the Self.(Talks, 433).

One=E2=80=99s efforts are dir=
ected only to remove one=E2=80=99s ignorance.Afterwards they
cease and the =
real Self is found to be always there. No effort is needed to
remain as the=
 Self. (Talks, 66).

The Truth is that the Self is constant and unintermitt=
ent Awareness. The
object of enquiry is to find the true nature of the Self=
 as Awareness. Let
one practise enquiry so long as separateness is perceive=
d. Once realisation
arises there is no further need for enquiry. The questi=
on will also not
arise. Can awareness ever think of questioning who is awar=
e? Awareness
remains pure and simple. (Talks, 454).

The Self is known to e=
veryone but not clearly. You always exist. The Be-ing
is the Self. =E2=80=
=98I am=E2=80=99 is the name of God. Of all the definitions of God, none
is=
 indeed so well put as the Biblical statement =E2=80=98I am that I am=E2=80=
=99 in Exodus
3, Verse 14. None is so
direct as the name JEHOVAH... I AM. T=
he Absolute Be-ing is what is... It is
the Self. It is God. Knowing the Sel=
f, God is known. In fact God is none
other than the Self. (Talks, 106).

Th=
ere is a state beyond our efforts or effortlessness. Until it is realised
e=
ffort is necessary. After tasting such Bliss, even once, one will
repeatedl=
y try to regain it. It is as difficult for a jnani to engage in
thoughts as=
 it is for an ajnani to be free from thoughts. (Talks, 141).

Reality is si=
mply the loss of the ego. Destroy the ego by seeking its
identity. Because =
ego is no entity it will automatically vanish and Reality
will shine forth =
by itself. This is the direct method whereas all other
methods are done onl=
y retaining the ego. In those paths there arise so many
doubts and the eter=
nal question remains to be tackled finally. But in this
method the final qu=
estion is the only one and it is raised from the very
beginning. No sadhana=
s are necessary for engaging in this quest. (Talks,
146).

Effortlessness w=
hile remaining aware is the state of Bliss,and that is
Realisation. (Talks,=
 295).

In a sense, speaking of Self-realisation is a delusion. It is only =
because
people have been under the delusion that the non-Self is the Self a=
nd the
unreal the Real that they have to be weaned out of it by the other d=
elusion
called Self-realisation,
because actually the Self always is the Se=
lf and there is no such thing as
realizing it. Who is to realize what, and =
how, when all that exists is the
Self and nothing but the Self? (Day by Day=
).

Free-will and destiny are ever-existent. Destiny is the result of past
=
action; it concerns the body. Let the body act as may suit it. Why are you
=
concerned with it? Why do you pay attention to it? Free-will and destiny
la=
st as long as the body lasts. But Wisdom (jnana) transcends both. The Self
=
is beyond knowledge and ignorance. Should anything happen it happens as the=

resultant of one=E2=80=99s past actions, of divine will and other factors.=
 (Talks,
193).

Free-will holds the field in association with individuality=
.As long as
individuality lasts so long there is Free-will. All the scriptu=
res are based
on this fact and they advise directing the Free-will in the r=
ight channel.
Find out to whom Free-will or
destiny matters. Abide in it. T=
hen these two are transcended.That is the
only purpose of discussing these =
questions. To who do they arise? Find out
and be at peace. (Talks, 426).

Y=
oga implies prior division and it means later union of one with the other.
=
Who is to be united with whom? You are the seeker, seeking union with
somet=
hing. That something is apart from you. You are aware of the Self. Seek
it =
and be it.That will expand as the Infinite. Then there will be no
question =
of yoga, etc. Whose is the separation (viyoga)? Find it. (Talks,
211).

He =
who instructs an ardent seeker to do this or that is not a true Master.
The=
 seeker is already afflicted by his activities and wants Peace and Rest.
In=
 other words he wants cessation of his activities. Instead of that he is
to=
ld do so something in addition to or in place of his other activities. Can
=
that be a help to the seeker? (Talks, 601).

Love postulates duality. How c=
an the Self be the object of Love? Love is not
different from the Self. Lov=
e of an object is an inferior order and cannot
endure. Whereas the Self is =
Love,in other words, God is Love. (Talks, 433).

Turn your vision inwards a=
nd the whole world will be full of the Supreme
Spirit. The world is said to=
 be illusion. Illusion is really Truth. Even the
material sciences trace th=
e origin of the universe to some primordial
matter... subtle, exceedingly s=
ubtle. (Talks, 199).

God is the same both to those who say the world is re=
al and to their
opponents. Their outlook is different. You need not entangl=
e yourself in
such disputations. The goal is one and the same for all. Look=
 to it. (Talks,
199).

The Bible says =E2=80=98Be still and know that I am =
God=E2=80=99.Stillness is the sole
requisite for the realisation of the Sel=
f as God. (Talks, 338).

Brahmacharya is =E2=80=98living in Brahman=E2=80=
=99. It has no connection with celibacy as
commonly understood. A real Brah=
machari finds Bliss in the Brahman which is
the same as the Self. Why then =
should you look for other sources of
happiness? In fact the emergence from =
the Self has been the cause of all the
misery.(Talks, 17).

When there is c=
ontact of a desirable sort or memory thereof, and when there
is freedom fro=
m undesirable contacts or memory thereof, we say there is
happiness. Such h=
appiness is relative and is better called pleasure. (Talks,
28).

But men w=
ant absolute and permanent happiness. This does not reside in
objects, but =
in the Absolute. It is Peace, free from pain and pleasure... it
is a neutra=
l state. (Talks, 28).

This is the Kingdom of Heaven. The Kingdom of Heaven=
 mentioned in the Bible
and this world are not two different regions. =E2=
=80=98The Kingdom is within you=E2=80=99
says the Bible. So it is.The reali=
sed being sees this as the Kingdom of
Heaven whereas others see it as =E2=
=80=98this world=E2=80=99. The difference lies only in
the angle of vision.=
 (Talks, 609).

Nirvana is Perfection. In the Perfect State there is neithe=
r subject nor
object; there is nothing to see, nothing to feel,nothing to k=
now. Seeking
and knowing are the functions of the mind. In Nirvana there is=
 nothing but
the blissful pure consciousness =E2=80=98I am=E2=80=99. (Talks=
, 406).
