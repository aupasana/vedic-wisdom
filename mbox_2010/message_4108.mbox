Talk 566

Atma is always Sat-Chit-Ananda. Of these, th=
e first two are experienced in
all the states, whereas the last one is said=
 to be experienced in sleep
only.

The question arises how the true nature =
of the Self can be lost in the
waking and dream states.It is,really speakin=
g,not lost.In sleep there is no
mind and the Self shines as Itself,whereas =
in the other two states what
shines forth is the reflected light of the Sel=
f.

Ananda is felt after the cessation of thoughts in sleep. It is also man=
ifest
on
other occasions as love, joy, etc., priya, moda and pramoda. But t=
hey are
all chitta vrittis (modes of mind).

When a man is walking in the s=
treet his mind is full of fleeting thoughts.
Suppose he passes a bazaar whe=
re some fine mangoes are for sale. He likes
the mangoes and purchases them.=
 He is next anxious to taste them. So he
hastens home and eats them and fee=
ls happy.

When the fleeting thoughts give way to the pleasure at the sight=
 of mangoes,
it is priya, when he gets them as his own, the pleasure is mod=
a; lastly,
when he eats them, the pleasure is pramoda.

All the three kinds=
 of pleasure are owing to the disappearance of other
thoughts.
