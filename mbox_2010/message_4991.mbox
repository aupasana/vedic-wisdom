Namaste,
         i am parijat dutta from kolkata.there are some issues goi=
ng on i need to discuss..

since i was 18-19,i became interested in tantras=
.and i worship ma kali.bt i feel i had and may be have to face several test=
s....like initially...i read books on tantra....wich promise highly materia=
listically beneficial sadhanas..
and alarmingly different dieties for each =
purpose...i fell for that...an my devotion was divided...between maa kali,d=
urga,laxmi,hanumanji..

with time i realized all these have no value withou=
t a gurus guidance.....my astrologer told me....that time will be arnd 29-3=
0 of my age.

then again...i was against krishna worship.....cuzz i thot fo=
oshingly  since he is only about love(bhakti)....he may not be strong like =
devis..
again since...all the tridevs need shakti...so i felt shakti worshi=
p is the highest....
un
also...at that time..i didnot like ramkrishna dev s=
ince he talked mostly of devotion...n not of powers like siddhis....
undest=
anding others thoughts n so on...as  i have personally seen some tantrics w=
ho have this power..


with time again i learnt bhakti is the highest......=
.i asked once a maharaj who presides over the ashram where my mother was in=
itiated ...
which is more powerful ?? bhakti or mantras ??....

he said...i=
n one word...bhakti is more powerful...without bhakti u wont have the urge =
to have a mantra...

again in a book....i read...the love of gopis for kris=
hna was such.....they forgot everything of mundane world..
they didnot want=
 to know who krishna was.....dint care if he was god or not......jst loving=
 for the sake of loving..
bhakti only for the sake of bhakti....

how wonde=
rful !!!....all these made me realize.....how foolish i was.....all i used =
to have for maa was bhakti...i dint 
know any mantra nothin (not now as wel=
l) and i was against on the other hand .....of krishna and ramkrishnadev wh=
o were epitome of bhakti...

at this time....i used to go to my mom's gurum=
aatas ashram...once in a spiritual discussion they said..
get hold of only =
one ......he/she is antaryami...she understands wat ur inner needs her...li=
ke a parent
definitely she will fulfill them......

at the same time....nar=
asimha ji told in one of the mails........"mother knows the best"...

these=
 have removed the misconceptions i had ...


what i want to know is when on=
e is devoted to maa why does she test ??.....is it a way to bring one close=
r to her through realizations ??...

when shes the all pervading shakti....=
why thers a need for test ??....also...while testing does she give her chil=
d enuff 
strength to pass the test ??

i am looking forward to guidance fro=
m u people...
