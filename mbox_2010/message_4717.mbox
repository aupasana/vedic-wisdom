=C2=A0 
Dear Narasimha,

=
Namaste,

It was Swami Vivekananda's greatness and humility to say that Swa=
mi Ramakrishna 
could create a thousand Vivekanandas out of sand. But in fa=
ct, even God cannot 
create a thousand Vivekanandas, because such an act wi=
ll destroy the very plan 
of God in making the world and its time cycles. G=
od sent Narendra and not sand 
to Paramhamsa. 


A real Guru knows who is f=
it for what. I have seen some hamsas and paramhamsas 
helping sinners and r=
eforming them to such an extent that lecherous and arrogant 
persons became=
 pious and even monks. But at the same time, many persons near and 
dear to=
 those gurus, who were neither lecherous nor arrogant, could not gain 
anyt=
hing worthwhile from same gurus. Strange are the ways of God and Guru, but =

true disciples are no less strange. Only a Guru knows how to tap the hidde=
n 
potential of a disciple. But every disciple does not possess same potent=
ial.

No paramhamsa says that this world is unfit for his service. I am not=
 a 
paramhamsa, and I feel I can say so for Paramhamsas on account of what =
I have 
seen. Paramhamsas do not complain, because they are above such thin=
gs. But 
others like me feel the pain. 


I sold my ancestral home for help=
ing some Sanskrit institutions, and instead of 
helping I soon found that t=
he entire society wanted nothing but my money, 
without even caring for whe=
ther that money will be used for education or not. 
All my life I worked fo=
r society, and later I found that it was my Lokaishanaa 
which was behind m=
y zeal for the good of society. Desire is hard to kill. It 
sublimates into=
 seemingly benign forms.

The real power to help others comes not from soci=
o-economic or political power, 
but from real spiritual Knowledge combined =
with the inner Shakti of a pure soul. 
Those who possess this power can hel=
p others from caves. Once, a great sadhu 
saved me from sure death by warni=
ng telepathically from a distance of many 
miles. All the real sadhus I kno=
w keep away from limelight as well as from 
humdrum of society, yet all the=
 hamsas or paramhamsas among them help others 
without any reward.

Chandra=
gupta was lucky to find a great guru. But Chanakya was also lucky to find 
=
a great disciple. Such disciples cannot be created at will. The real war be=
tween 
disciples of Chanakya and Aristotle (Ari+stotra =3D praiser of demon=
s, asuras) has 
not been properly described by historians. Had Alexander co=
nquered India, we 
would have lost our culture, history and identity.

Ther=
e is no dearth of Chanakyas. They will come out of caves when the need 
ari=
ses. And the need will soon arise. Centre of gravity of Western world is no=
w 
turning backwards, from North America to Estern Europe and then to Greec=
e-Egypt 
&c. And in the East, from Japan to China and then to India. First =
casualty of 
this sea change will be Christianity, at the hands of Islamic =
fundamentalists. 
It will be accompanied with superpower status of India. I=
t will call many 
Chanakyas and Chandraguptas. SOON !

I do not want to mea=
sure the heights or depths of hamsas and paramhamsas. They 
are all great, =
and that is all we need.

I do not see any essential difference with you at=
 any point, except in usage of 
certain words.
It is a minor linguistic pro=
blem.

Rohiniranjan is not an atheist. He is a bhakt of MAA, and of Ganapat=
i Ji too. He 
is rather imaginative and wants rebooting into a new awakenin=
g, into new 
consciousness perhaps, bored with old religions. Perhaps his p=
ersonal experience 
of men of religion is not happy. But he never found a G=
uru, as far as I know, 
and he does not know the loss. Without a real Guru,=
 religion is farce or at best 
a dead set of meaningless rituals. Guru impa=
rts true meanings to our existence 
as well as to everything else.

is never possible to articulate this knowledge perfectly, using vaikhari. K=
nowledge like this can be digested and absorbed only though experience and =
not through reading or hearing words spoken in vaikhari. But then, words sp=
oken in vaikhari can serve the important purpose of
 inspiring one, perhaps=
 to investigate and/or to do sadhana.<BR>> <BR>> There is no alternat=

or whatever.<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> <BR>> > Rhetorical Questi=

each person. However corrupted, religion and
 fear of god bring some sanity=
 and order to the world!<BR>> <BR>> It is true that some religions an=

 doing something, as Gita says, what is Akarma in fact? Whatever be the mod=
e or type of action of a Gyani, it is done without any desire of fruit for =
self, and therefore the actions of a Gyani should not be included in genera=
