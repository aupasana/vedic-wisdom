Namaste=C2=A0Atul=C2=A0ji,

Very good mail. Let me add a bit to some points=
 you have mentioned.

=C2=A0Books and articles by Peta members are far more=
 convincing for switching to Veg 
sources. I can also provide tens of links=
 and book reference which oppose their 
view.
=C2=A0
A few months back, I f=
ound myself in the middle of a very serious debate on 
scientific relevance=
 of veganism. A group of vegan evangelists were on one side 
and a person w=
ith a solid scientific temperament on the other side. More than 
300 messag=
es were exchanged in huge, point by point debate. Eventually the vegan 
eva=
ngelists resorted to abusing and what not. Thats ok, but during the course =
of 
the conversation, I had to read up a lot of actual science on nutrition=
 and 
became amazed to find that there is=C2=A0very little science on the s=
ide of the 
vegans. This is sad but true. What is bad is most of the points=
 generally raised 
by=C2=A0vegan websites etc=C2=A0do not stand the=C2=A0sc=
rutiny of real science, they merely 
cherrry pick from researches, take a l=
ine and a line there, and jump to hasty 
conclusion to drive their agenda h=
ome. That is politics and not science! 

=C2=A0
I am a vegetarian, but I ta=
ke serious=C2=A0exception to such politics in the name of 
science. 

=C2=
=A0
Again, I think and believe that practically it is impossible to shift a=
ll the 
population to veg sources especially when the agriculture land is d=
ecreasing day 
by day because of many reasons)
=C2=A0
Not only is it imposs=
ible, but it is also=C2=A0unnatural. 
=C2=A0
See,=C2=A0 I ask one question.=
 If humans were supposed to be herbivores, why don't we 
have a caecum in t=
he stomach, why is the size of the intestines similar and 
facilitative of =
omnivorous diets, and lastly, why is there such a tremendous gap 
in the bi=
o-availability between vegeterian and non vegeterian sources of 
food.=C2=
=A0The very body structure of humans have become modified by evolution for =
an 
omnivorous diet,=C2=A0so what science are we talking about? The reason =
that the 
pancreas is almost an appendage is due to the fact that humans as=
 a speciees 
were force to shift to a=C2=A0animal protient diet to sustain =
itself. The pancreas 
was like a caecum at one point, way back, before the =
species moved into 
grasslands. Eating fruits came much later (there are go=
od reasons for this).=C2=A0Had 
this shift in food resulting in body struct=
ural change=C2=A0not happened, the species 
woudl not have survived at all.=

=C2=A0
My point is simple,=C2=A0 eat whatever you feel like, based on your=
 culture, 
upbrining, likes/dislikes etc etc=C2=A0but a) do not believe in =
fake science b) do 
not unnecessarily=C2=A0evangelize people trying to conv=
ert them to x or y food habit, 
because,=C2=A0for every one point that is r=
aised by one side, counter points can be 
raised by the other.I dislike eva=
ngelism of all kinds, be it=C2=A0Christian 
evangelism or Vegan evangelism.=
 

=C2=A0
=C2=A0
____________
=C2=A0
PS: The topic of ethics and karma is=
=C2=A0long, and needs deep thinking. This is 
seperate from the science I m=
entioned above. While it=C2=A0is absolutely true that 
killing is a damagin=
g karma, the issue is far from being that simple. None of 
the holy men I h=
ave read till, except Vimalananda, actually makes any atempt to 
understand=
 the complexity of the problem, leave aside giving a holistic view of 
thin=
gs.=C2=A0Vimalananda does not provide an answer but he appreaciates the pro=
blem, 
which is an excellent frist step.=C2=A0This 3rd book=C2=A0on karma i=
s an IQ 
puzzle.=C2=A0Damn=C2=A0good stuff!=C2=A0 For example he acknowledg=
es that all people can never 
shift to vegeterianism, in which case he talk=
s about the 3fold law of Buddhists, 
i.e. the karma of meat gets distribute=
d among a) the one who kills b) the one 
who dresses the meat c) the one wh=
o cooks, leaving the one who eats with least 
karma to deal with.=C2=A0 He =
also acknowledges that crops are equally unnatural as 
breeding animals for=
 food, and there is solid karma=C2=A0involved here too. 
Personally he advi=
ses against meat eating, which is correct, in the sense that 
those who eat=
 meat, can't keep the preparation and quantity under balance. 
Neither they=
 know of how to tackle the karma. Therefore avoiding is good, 
but=C2=A0not=
 compulsory. 

=C2=A0
Someone mentioned about mistreatment of animals bred =
for food, and this karma 
adds, this is true. But how about the crops we bu=
y from the market, passing 
through=C2=A0x number of middle men who cheat t=
he farmer and each other, the farmer 
remains miserably poor and often ends=
 up commiting suicide, not to forget the 
extremely unnatural act of adding=
 serious chemicals to the soil to increase 
production resulting in spoilin=
g the soil completely and affecting the quality 
of the food grains in the =
process. In this age, veg or non veg, you cannot 
escape bad karmas from fo=
od.
=C2=A0
To understand and appreciate the complexity of the problem on a =
large time scale 
consider this, when=C2=A0man went to open grasslands it s=
tarted two simultaneously 
processes.=C2=A0Domesticating animals and croppi=
ng, both of which are unnatural.=C2=A0Of 
all animals only a handful could =
get domesticated, rest did not.=C2=A0Why? Humans 
then reared them in a=C2=
=A0quid pro quo basis, for=C2=A0food, wool, milk etc etc. These 
animal wou=
ld=C2=A0NOT have survived=C2=A0as a species, had it not been for human 
int=
ervention. Just like rice/wheat crops would never have survived in the plan=
t 
kingdom,. had=C2=A0humans not cultivated them purposefully.=C2=A0So this=
 looks more like 
a=C2=A0design of nature than any thing else. It may inter=
est you to know that Robert 
Svboda shifted completely to a vegenterian die=
t, but eventually had to include 
eggs in his diet, since his body reacted.=
 It can=C2=A0happen to some people when a 
natural protein source is cut ou=
t, to which the body is accustomed. =C2=A0He 
mentioned this in during an i=
nterview.

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Food we eat

=C2=A0 
Respected members,

Thanks=
 for responding to my posts and thanks for having a healthy discussion so 
=
far.

Please let me do an effort to simplify the discussion and remove some=
 confusion 
from the discussion. Please point out my mistakes I will make i=
n this process.

We are trying to discuss three points here

1) Choosing a =
dietary habit
2) Dependence of Human population on Non-veg sources of nutri=
tion
3) bioavailability or BV of Non veg vs Veg food.

I commented on two p=
oints 

1) Choosing a dietary habit 
2) Dependence of Human population on n=
on veg sources of nutrition

1) Choosing a Dietary habit

One should choose=
 his dietary habit based on his varna (aptitude and attitude) 
and goal in =
his life. He should not bother what the BV or other factor or 
research say=
s. For an athlete, Eggs are important part of his training. and for 
a pers=
on seeking spirituality one should stick to vegetarian food unless he is 
a=
ble to rise above the difference in veg and nonveg. I agree with Narasimha =
Ji 
about this point.

In some diseases Non veg sources play an very import=
ant role (Although not a 
necessasity) like in Albumin deficiency two eggs =
per day can save a person from 
costly (3000Rs per Inj) Albumin Injections.=
 In TB, Soup made of goat meat do 
wonders. Ayurveda also recommend it stro=
ngly Charak Samhita) etc.

2) Dependence of Human population on non veg sou=
rces of nutrition

I agree with the link provided in this discussions. Book=
s and articles by Peta 
members are far more convincing for switching to Ve=
g sources. I can also provide 
tens of links and book reference which oppos=
e their view. Honestly, I do not 
believe each and every information on net=
 and not every book written about 
nutirtion, just like astrology. Let us l=
eave this debate aside and look at other 
aspect of it.

By 'Practically im=
possible' I meant the cost factor and demand/supply factor. In 
India (Leav=
e other high Nonveg consuming countries alone) about 45% people are 
Non ve=
getarian and about 40% demand of Proteins are supplied by Non veg sources. =

Currently, Important veg sourcesof proteins are Legumes (including gram 
s=
oyabean, pulses etc. Costs about Rs 80 -120 Rs per Kg), Nuts (include almon=
ds 
cashew etc - Costs needn't mention), Dairy products (Milk being 30-40 R=
s per 
Kg), Grains (cheapest sources but not a very complete source), 


In=
 last two years, their demand rose by 15-20 % but their price rose by 40-60=
%. 
even at current price, 60 % of population can not afford a complete bal=
anced 
diet as recommended by Experts which include 250 Ml of milk, 50-70 g=
ms of 
legumes, 10 gms of vegetables, 150 gms of fruits per person, along w=
ith grains 
and roughage etc (These are approx minimum quantities. Differen=
t sources may 
quote different quantities). There is average family size of=
 5 and average 
family income is 200 Rs per day! And nutrition is not the o=
nly thing needed in 
our life!!! Lot of other expenditures are there

Even =
at current prices, 60% population can not afford balanced diet. If 
additio=
nal 40% is included in demand of veg sources, price may rise another 100% 
=
and I need not to explain what will happen at that time.

Sir, I am not adv=
ocating Non-veg food here. I am also a strict vegetarian, even 
for milk I =
prefer a source where there is minimum cruelity (Yes you can not 
expect no=
 cruelity even for milk if you buy it from market and do not produce it 
yo=
urself)

Again, I think and believe that practically it is impossible to sh=
ift all the 
population to veg sources especially when the agriculture land=
 is decreasing day 
by day because of many reasons)

3) Bioavailability or =
BV of different sources

It is always a questionable point. because again s=
ections supporting vegetarian 
diet will highlight the results which suppor=
t veg food and vice versa. There are 
lot of halfbaked researches. but if w=
e think scientifically we will find that 
for different sources different s=
ources are better. For example calcium animal 
sources are best (Including =
milk), for albumin Egg is best, for Vit C veg 
sources are best, for protei=
ns animal sources are best (Ayurveda also support 
this) So I think we can =
not say that only veg or non veg will suffice the diet. 
Obviously humans c=
an not survive on Nonveg food alone. As far as BV is concerned 
I agree wit=
h the values given by Rajarshi ji.

Yes, I agree Non veg food increases tam=
as in mind. But so does the deep fried 
vegetarian food, although less but =
in daily habit it will not let you escape 
from Tamas. I agree with Narasim=
ha Ji that if more energy is used in digesting 
food, less energy is availa=
ble for brain. it is a scietific fact that after 
food, significant blood s=
upply is directed to intestines. How much Rajas Spicy 
food, tea, coffee, c=
oke and Red bull is increasing in us? We are what we eat! 
This is true. So=
 one should eat what one want to become.

But still at last, I want to ment=
ion that I am not advocating Non-veg food. I am 
just highlighting the fact=
s. I am a strict vegetarian too. We should understand 
that we may be right=
 but we should realise that it does not necessarily mean 
other person is n=
ot right.

Please point out my mistakes I had made in this post. I agree th=
at some values i 
mentioned here may not be exactly as quoted by sources. B=
ut they are approximate 
and not too much off the line.

Kind Regards
Atul

<DIV>Namaste Atul ji,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbs=
p;</DIV>
<DIV>Very good mail. Let me add a bit to some points you have ment=
ioned.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV><EM> Books and articles by Peta me=
mbers are far more convincing for switching to Veg sources. I can also prov=
ide tens of links and book reference which oppose their view.</EM></DIV>
<P=
><EM></EM> </P>
<P>A few months back, I found myself in the middle of =
a very serious debate on scientific relevance of veganism. A group of vegan=
 evangelists were on one side and a person with a solid scientific temperam=
ent on the other side. More than 300 messages were exchanged in huge, point=
 by point debate. Eventually the vegan evangelists resorted to abusing and =
what not. Thats ok, but during the course of the conversation, I had to rea=
d up a lot of actual science on nutrition and became amazed to find that th=
ere is very little science on the side of the vegans. This is sad but =
true. What is bad is most of the points generally raised by vegan webs=
ites etc do not stand the scrutiny of real science, they merely c=
herrry pick from researches, take a line and a line there, and jump to hast=
y conclusion to drive their agenda home. That is politics and not science! =
</P>
<P> </P>
<P>I am a vegetarian, but I take serious exception =
to such politics in the name of science. </P>
<P> </P>
<P><EM>Again, I=
 think and believe that practically it is impossible to shift all the popul=
ation to veg sources especially when the agriculture land is decreasing day=
 by day because of many reasons)</EM></P>
<P><EM></EM> </P>
<P>Not onl=
y is it impossible, but it is also unnatural. </P>
<P> </P>
<P>Se=
e,  I ask one question. If humans were supposed to be herbivores, why =
don't we have a caecum in the stomach, why is the size of the intestines si=
milar and facilitative of omnivorous diets, and lastly, why is there such a=
 tremendous gap in the bio-availability between vegeterian and non vegeteri=
an sources of food. The very body structure of humans have become modi=
fied by evolution for an omnivorous diet, so what science are we talki=
ng about? The reason that the pancreas is almost an appendage is due to the=
 fact that humans as a speciees were force to shift to a animal protie=
nt diet to sustain itself. The pancreas was like a caecum at one point, way=
 back, before the species moved into grasslands. Eating fruits came much la=
ter (there are good reasons for this). Had this shift in food resultin=
g in body structural change not happened, the species woudl not have s=
urvived at all.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>My point is simple,  eat whatever=
 you feel like, based on your culture, upbrining, likes/dislikes etc etc&nb=
sp;but a) do not believe in fake science b) do not unnecessarily evang=
elize people trying to convert them to x or y food habit, because, for=
 every one point that is raised by one side, counter points can be raised b=
y the other.I dislike evangelism of all kinds, be it Christian evangel=
ism or Vegan evangelism. </P>
<P> </P>
<P> </P>
<P>____________</=
P>
<P> </P>
<P>PS: The topic of ethics and karma is long, and nee=
ds deep thinking. This is seperate from the science I mentioned above. Whil=
e it is absolutely true that killing is a damaging karma, the issue is=
 far from being that simple. None of the holy men I have read till, except =
Vimalananda, actually makes any atempt to understand the complexity of the =
problem, leave aside giving a holistic view of things. Vimalananda doe=
s not provide an answer but he appreaciates the problem, which is an excell=
ent frist step. This 3rd book on karma is an IQ puzzle. Damn=
 good stuff!  For example he acknowledges that all people can nev=
er shift to vegeterianism, in which case he talks about the 3fold law of Bu=
ddhists, i.e. the karma of meat gets distributed among a) the one who kills=
 b) the one who dresses the meat c) the one who cooks, leaving the one who =
eats with least karma to deal with.  He also acknowledges that crops a=
re equally
 unnatural as breeding animals for food, and there is solid karm=
a involved here too. Personally he advises against meat eating, which =
is correct, in the sense that those who eat meat, can't keep the preparatio=
n and quantity under balance. Neither they know of how to tackle the karma.=
 Therefore avoiding is good, but not compulsory. </P>
<P> </P>
<P=
>Someone mentioned about mistreatment of animals bred for food, and this ka=
rma adds, this is true. But how about the crops we buy from the market, pas=
sing through x number of middle men who cheat the farmer and each othe=
r, the farmer remains miserably poor and often ends up commiting suicide, n=
ot to forget the extremely unnatural act of adding serious chemicals to the=
 soil to increase production resulting in spoiling the soil completely and =
affecting the quality of the food grains in the process. In this age, veg o=
r non veg, you cannot escape bad karmas from food.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>To =
understand and appreciate the complexity of the problem on a large time sca=
le consider this, when man went to open grasslands it started two simu=
ltaneously processes. Domesticating animals and cropping, both of whic=
h are unnatural. Of all animals only a handful could get domesticated,=
 rest did not. Why? Humans then reared them in a quid pro quo bas=
is, for food, wool, milk etc etc. These animal would NOT have sur=
vived as a species, had it not been for human intervention. Just like =
rice/wheat crops would never have survived in the plant kingdom,. had =
humans not cultivated them purposefully. So this looks more like a&nbs=
p;design of nature than any thing else. It may interest you to know that Ro=
bert Svboda shifted completely to a vegenterian diet, but eventually had to=
 include eggs in his diet, since his body reacted. It can happen to so=
me people when a natural protein source is cut out, to which
 the body is a=
ccustomed.  He mentioned this in during an interview. </P>

<P>Respected me=
mbers,<BR><BR>Thanks for responding to my posts and thanks for having a hea=
lthy discussion so far.<BR><BR>Please let me do an effort to simplify the d=
iscussion and remove some confusion from the discussion. Please point out m=
y mistakes I will make in this process.<BR><BR>We are trying to discuss thr=
ee points here<BR><BR>1) Choosing a dietary habit<BR>2) Dependence of Human=
 population on Non-veg sources of nutrition<BR>3) bioavailability or BV of =
Non veg vs Veg food.<BR><BR>I commented on two points <BR><BR>1) Choosing a=
 dietary habit <BR>2) Dependence of Human population on non veg sources of =
nutrition<BR><BR>1) Choosing a Dietary habit<BR><BR>One should choose his d=
ietary habit based on his varna (aptitude and attitude) and goal in his lif=
e. He should not bother what the BV or other factor or research says. For a=
n athlete, Eggs are important part of his training. and for a person seekin=
g spirituality one should stick to vegetarian food
 unless he is able to ri=
se above the difference in veg and nonveg. I agree with Narasimha Ji about =
this point.<BR><BR>In some diseases Non veg sources play an very important =
role (Although not a necessasity) like in Albumin deficiency two eggs per d=
ay can save a person from costly (3000Rs per Inj) Albumin Injections. In TB=
, Soup made of goat meat do wonders. Ayurveda also recommend it strongly Ch=
arak Samhita) etc.<BR><BR>2) Dependence of Human population on non veg sour=
ces of nutrition<BR><BR>I agree with the link provided in this discussions.=
 Books and articles by Peta members are far more convincing for switching t=
o Veg sources. I can also provide tens of links and book reference which op=
pose their view. Honestly, I do not believe each and every information on n=
et and not every book written about nutirtion, just like astrology. Let us =
leave this debate aside and look at other aspect of it.<BR><BR>By 'Practica=
lly impossible' I meant the cost factor and
 demand/supply factor. In India=
 (Leave other high Nonveg consuming countries alone) about 45% people are N=
on vegetarian and about 40% demand of Proteins are supplied by Non veg sour=
ces. Currently, Important veg sourcesof proteins are Legumes (including gra=
m soyabean, pulses etc. Costs about Rs 80 -120 Rs per Kg), Nuts (include al=
monds cashew etc - Costs needn't mention), Dairy products (Milk being 30-40=
 Rs per Kg), Grains (cheapest sources but not a very complete source), <BR>=
<BR>In last two years, their demand rose by 15-20 % but their price rose by=
 40-60%. even at current price, 60 % of population can not afford a complet=
e balanced diet as recommended by Experts which include 250 Ml of milk, 50-=
70 gms of legumes, 10 gms of vegetables, 150 gms of fruits per person, alon=
g with grains and roughage etc (These are approx minimum quantities. Differ=
ent sources may quote different quantities). There is average family size o=
f 5 and average family income is 200
 Rs per day! And nutrition is not the =
only thing needed in our life!!! Lot of other expenditures are there<BR><BR=
>Even at current prices, 60% population can not afford balanced diet. If ad=
ditional 40% is included in demand of veg sources, price may rise another 1=
00% and I need not to explain what will happen at that time.<BR><BR>Sir, I =
am not advocating Non-veg food here. I am also a strict vegetarian, even fo=
r milk I prefer a source where there is minimum cruelity (Yes you can not e=
xpect no cruelity even for milk if you buy it from market and do not produc=
e it yourself)<BR><BR>Again, I think and believe that practically it is imp=
ossible to shift all the population to veg sources especially when the agri=
culture land is decreasing day by day because of many reasons)<BR><BR>3) Bi=
oavailability or BV of different sources<BR><BR>It is always a questionable=
 point. because again sections supporting vegetarian diet will highlight th=
e results which support veg
 food and vice versa. There are lot of halfbake=
d researches. but if we think scientifically we will find that for differen=
t sources different sources are better. For example calcium animal sources =
are best (Including milk), for albumin Egg is best, for Vit C veg sources a=
re best, for proteins animal sources are best (Ayurveda also support this) =
So I think we can not say that only veg or non veg will suffice the diet. O=
bviously humans can not survive on Nonveg food alone. As far as BV is conce=
rned I agree with the values given by Rajarshi ji.<BR><BR>Yes, I agree Non =
veg food increases tamas in mind. But so does the deep fried vegetarian foo=
d, although less but in daily habit it will not let you escape from Tamas. =
I agree with Narasimha Ji that if more energy is used in digesting food, le=
ss energy is available for brain. it is a scietific fact that after food, s=
ignificant blood supply is directed to intestines. How much Rajas Spicy foo=
d, tea, coffee, coke
 and Red bull is increasing in us? We are what we eat!=
 This is true. So one should eat what one want to become.<BR><BR>But still =
at last, I want to mention that I am not advocating Non-veg food. I am just=
 highlighting the facts. I am a strict vegetarian too. We should understand=
 that we may be right but we should realise that it does not necessarily me=
an other person is not right.<BR><BR>Please point out my mistakes I had mad=
e in this post. I agree that some values i mentioned here may not be exactl=
y as quoted by sources. But they are approximate and not too much off the l=
ine.<BR><BR>Kind Regards<BR>Atul<BR><BR>--- In <A href=3D"mailto:vedic-wisd=

gt; Namaste friends,<BR>> <BR>> There has been a lot of discussion on=
 food. A few quick comments.<BR>> <BR>> (1) We are we we eat. Product=
ion of various chemicals in our body and their <BR>> interactions, are c=
ontrolled by what we eat. Thus, what we eat has a profound <BR>> impact =
on us.<BR>> <BR>> (2) Much has been written on the material benefits =
from vegetarianism. But that <BR>> is not all. There are spiritual and s=
ubtle reasons as well.<BR>> <BR>> Eating the flesh or body parts of a=
n animal that strongly identifies with the <BR>> physical body entails a=
 karma. Self-identification of plants with their physical <BR>> body is =
much subtler and
 the karma entailed in eating plant-based foods is much <B=
R>> smaller.<BR>> <BR>> Especially these days, very cruel methods =
are used for meat production by <BR>> corporations and animals are treat=
ed very cruelly. Part of the karma for their <BR>> suffering goes to the=
 ones benefiting from their meat.<BR>> <BR>> (3) I heard an interview=
 with a scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) several <BR>> months ba=
ck. They conducted an experiment on gorillas. One set of gorillas was <BR>&=
gt; fed with meat. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After sever=
al <BR>> months, researchers found a gap in the intelligence of the two =
sets. The ones <BR>> fed with meat were duller.<BR>> <BR>> Their t=
heory was that digestion of meat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed with <B=
R>> nuts and fruits may have diverted more energy towards the developmen=
t of brain. <BR>> Though they were not sure if the same thing applies to=
 human
 beings or not, a <BR>> balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maxi=
mize one's intellectual development.<BR>> <BR>> (4) After we eat a he=
avy meal, we may feel dull or sleepy and cannot focus well <BR>> on work=
 that requires alertness and skill. That is because the digestive process <=
BR>> is using up a lot of energy (also known as agni or fire) and there =
isn't much <BR>> agni available for other activities such as digestion o=
f intellectual ideas that <BR>> happens in the mind. Similarly, digestio=
n of spiritual ideas/experiences also <BR>> requires agni and that canno=
t happen well. That is why meditation or homam after <BR>> a heavy meal =
are fruitless and we are normally advised to do sadhana before <BR>> eat=
ing.<BR>> <BR>> (5) If foods that light up a higher digestive agni (e=
.g. meats, deep fried food <BR>> with more oil, spicy foods that stimula=
te digestive agni etc) are consumed more <BR>> frequently, agni is
 dive=
rted towards digestion more often and there is less agni <BR>> available=
 for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and experiences. If <BR>=
> one eats saattwik food that is very easy to digest (simple grains, sim=
ple <BR>> lentils and simple vegetables, all softly cooked with mild spi=
ces, and fruits), <BR>> less agni is diverted towards digestion and more=
 agni is available for <BR>> assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ide=
as and experiences.<BR>> <BR>> (6) Even a big fire cannot burn wet gr=
ass well. But huge stacks of dry grass may <BR>> be burnt by just one sp=
ark! Similarly, little bit of internal fire may be enough <BR>> to assim=
ilate spiritual ideas and experiences in a person with excellent <BR>> v=
aasanas and few obstructions (dry grass). A lot of internal fire may be nee=
ded <BR>> in a person with poor vaasanas and many obstructions (wet gras=
s). Thus, it all <BR>> depends on vaasanas and impurities in
 nadis and =
chakras.<BR>> <BR>> One person may eat meat and deep fried foods, spe=
nd a lot of agni on digesting <BR>> them and yet make excellent spiritua=
l progress. Another person may eat saattwik <BR>> food, maximize the agn=
i available for spiritual transformation and yet struggle <BR>> to progr=
ess spiritually. However, the best course of action for one is to ignore <B=
R>> counter-examples and be a vegetarian. All other things being equal, =
that <BR>> maximizes the agni available for spiritual progress.<BR>> =
<BR>> (7) Regarding Priya's question: Animals have their own vaasanas an=
d their needs. <BR>> If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. =
Otherwise, feed the poor <BR>> fellow whatever he/she needs.<BR>> <BR=
>> (8) One should eat to live and not live to eat. A yogi should consume=
 enough <BR>> food to sustain oneself so that one can fulfil one's dharm=
a in the material <BR>> world using physical body and
 make spiritual pr=
ogress. Eating too much food is <BR>> not good for spiritual sadhana.<BR=
>> <BR>> Instead of overeating most of the time and fasting on specif=
ic days, it is <BR>> better to eat limited amount always. Regular practi=
ces are more important for <BR>> transformation and success, than occasi=
onal practices.<BR>> <BR>> (9) By merely thinking that god is the doe=
r of all actions or considering food <BR>> to be god's prasad, one canno=
t escape the karma involved. It depends on how <BR>> deeply ingrained th=
at thought is and how deeply one feels so. If one internally <BR>> feels=
 100% that god is acting through one and whatever one is doing (e.g. <BR>&g=
t; eating) is just god's prasad to one, then one is free.<BR>> <BR>> =
