Namaste friends,
 
Nice writeup. As long as one remains in duality, there i=
s always a chance of being deluded. However, with due respect, I wish to ma=
ke a *critical* note with my 2 cents on various realted and unrelated issue=
s. Please allow me.

a sense of difference

It is certainly wise to "remai=
n without fear in the supreme state of non-duality". However, as you pointe=
d out, "[even] great devas are disturbed by fear". Then how easy can it be =
for other beings, including members of this list, to "remain without fear i=
n the supreme state of non-duality"?
 
Please don't get me wrong. I am not =
against adwaita or non-duality at all, as those familiar with my writings s=
hould know by now. But I accept the fact that a huge majority of spiritual =
seekers are meant to remain in duality for many many more lives. A message =
other than "attain the supreme state of non-duality" may be more useful to =
them at their current stage!
 
*        *        *
 
A great cricket batsma=
n may not make the greatest coach. Hitting the ball may seem so easy to him=
 and he may simply say, "look at the ball and hit it." That much instructio=
n is certainly not enough for a budding player to start playing like that g=
reat player.
 
Another gifted coach may observe faults in the technique of =
the budding player and give some tips. That may turn out to be more useful =
than the inspiring words from the great player! Of course, no matter how go=
od instructions one gets, the budding player may not play like that great p=
layer anytime soon! Nevertheless, his goal should be to keep improving!
 
*=
        *        *
 
Some great teachers, especially of the Adwaita philoso=
phy, are like the great cricket batsman in the above analogy. They tell you=
 what is obvious and natural to *them*. Their words are very inspiring.
 
S=
ome other teachers fine-tune their message for an audience. They show a rea=
l path (instead of a lofty target) using which one can start making progres=
s. One may or may not reach a supreme state anytime soon, but one will star=
t making progress.
 
*        *        *
 
Different spiritual teachers com=
e for different purposes. The role played by each one is important in its o=
wn right. Ramana maharshi was undoubtedly a great master. However, when it =
comes to the second category of teachers I mentioned above, one name that s=
trikes to me instantly is that of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. He was a master =
at fine-tuning his message for the individual. While most great masters wer=
e adepts in one path (jnaana yoga or bhakti yoga or karma yoga or raja yoga=
), he was unique in that he experienced the supreme through each path and w=
as equally comfortable guiding people in jnaana, vedanta, Raama bhakti, Kri=
shna bhakti, Kaali bhakti, Shiva bhakti, karma yoga, service, hatha yoga, t=
antra etc, having experienced all. He even did smashana sadhanas, Islamic s=
adhanas and experienced Jesus Christ. He is a unique teacher in the last fe=
w millennia. Many other masters take disciples on the path they walked. Hav=
ing walked all paths to the summit, Ramakrishna guided disciples on differe=
nt paths based on their aptitude.
 
*        *        *
 
Though upanishads=
 and Bhagavad Gita are teaching Adwaita clearly, some great masters came in=
 the last few millennia who taught variations in the Upanishadic philosophy=
 veering towards duality to various degrees. I think this happened for a pu=
rpose. As true Adwaita as taught by Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita becomes mo=
re and more inappropriate and difficult for the masses, a simpler message t=
hat they can understand and that can guide their spiritual lives is needed.=
 I think the coming of various masters who taught different philosophies is=
 for that reason.
 
*        *        *
 
The title of the mail was "Fearle=
ssness Comes In The Supreme State Of Non-duality". However, the question is=
: Does non-duality bring fearlessness or vice versa?
 
A realization of non=
-dual Self may suddenly happen oneday for some rare persons. For most, it h=
appens as a result of sadhana done over many years/lives. Thus, qualities l=
ike dispassion, fearlessness (which are associated with the supreme state) =
need to be cultivated actively. As they become more and more perfected, one=
 gets closer and closer to Self-realization.
 
Suppose one sees a beautiful=
/ugly object (or a desirable/undesirable object). When one feels attraction=
/aversion, one should remind oneself "all is god (Self). There is no need f=
or feeling attraction/aversion towards anything." When one feels fear, one =
should remind oneself "all is god (Self). There is no need for be afraid of=
 *anything*". As one practices this, one's dispassion and fearlessness incr=
ease. Incidents of delusion becomes smaller and less frequent. Eventually, =
one overcomes.
 
But the tricky part is that one needs to perform the actio=
ns one is meant to perform and work out the kaarmik debts, before one reali=
zes Self. It is very difficult to perform actions without feeling even smal=
l amounts of attachment, attraction, aversion, passion, fear etc.
 
A simpl=
e formula is: Give all you can and expect nothing (and accept whatever you =
get) in return. In the beginning, any attraction/aversion/anxiety/fear you =
feel should be with regard to what are giving to others and not with regard=
 to what you are expecting from others.
 
*        *        *
 
It is all e=
asy to write and read theory. The problem comes when one is tested in real =
life. For example, I choked when eating something once when I was alone and=
 could not breathe. I became anxious and it made it worse. Suddenly, the th=
ought came to me "what are you afraid of? Death? This will mostly result in=
 a little suffering for a couple of minutes and no more. EVEN IF it results=
 in death, what is the big deal? Jaatasya dhruvam mrityuh (each being who i=
s born is sure of deatth). Is there anything I wanted to do and could not d=
o? Well, there may be, but someone else can do it. Why should only Narasimh=
a do it? World will run perfectly fine even if I am not here. If I indeed d=
ie now, why don't I meditate and focus my mind on god, instead of focusing =
on my life and getting anxious?" I relaxed and meditated for a few minutes =
with Gayatri mantra. My anxiety went away and I felt nice after a while.
 
=
As one detects and actively suppresses undesirable thoughts more and more, =
such thoughts will become less and less frequent and eventually be suppress=
ed by the mind even in the seed/formatory state. Later, causes of those see=
ds themselves will be wiped out from the sub-conscious mind. This is how co=
nditioning of the mind is slowly overcome. It is certainly a long process f=
or most of us, but one loses nothing by starting and trying to make progres=
s. Sadhanas like homam and japam aid one in this.
 
Please note that even R=
amana maharshi and Ramakrishna Paramahamsa did intense sadhana for many yea=
rs, before they could reach the supreme state. No matter who you are, some =
sadhana is needed.
 
*        *        *
 
While on the topic of Adwaita, I=
 want to make one more point. It poses two dangers. While the Ultimate Real=
ity is indeed non-dual, *half-baked* understanding of Adwaita philosophy ca=
n make one *trivialize* duality on one extreme or *glorify* ignorance on th=
e other extreme. Let me explain.
 
Reading that the ultimate reality behind=
 all that we see is the non-dual Self can make some people trivialize the d=
uality that we normally experience. If duality is "mithya" (an illusion), h=
ow does it matter and how do our actions within it matter? It is all, after=
 all, an illusion.
 
Of course, a true student of vedanta will know that th=
e layer of illusion is quite important and cannot be ignored simply because=
 it is an "illusion". If one's consciousness is veiled by the layer of illu=
sion, actions within that layer of illusion are required for removing it. I=
t will not magically disappear. After all, yoga vaasishtham emphasizes "act=
ions" in the dual world for realizing non-dual Self. Action and knowledge a=
s the two wings with which the bird of individualized consciousness rises f=
rom the ground of duality to reach the sky of true Self.
 
On the other ext=
reme, 
 
*        *        *
 
Enough for now. I have not gone anywhere and=
 still reading the list regularly. But I did not have motivation to reply t=
o any recent mails. Basically, if I have no useful or meaningful comment/re=
ply, I keep quiet.
 
Intellectual exchanges are interesting, but the thing =
that matters at the end of the day is whether we are doing sincere sadhana =
or not and whether we are progressing or not. It seems to me like several p=
eople are sincerely doing homam/japam and sincerely trying to make progress=
. Several more people are about to do the same. THAT is what really matters=
. What we think or say about the world, duality and non-duality is irreleva=
nt really. What matters is whether our attitude is changing for the better.=

 
*        *        *
 
Let me give one more quick analogy before I stop f=
or now.
 
Suppose one is sleeping and seeing an elaborate dream. Suppose on=
e is fully absorbed in the dream and weeping in pain when something bad hap=
pens in the dream and laughing in elation when something good happens in th=
e dream. One can tell that it is bad.
 
Suppose another person has read *in=
 the dream* that what one is experiencing is called a "dream" and will end =
soon and what happens in the dream is irrelevant. Suppose one intellectuall=
y understands all that and yet weeps in pain when something bad happens in =
the dream and laughs in elation when something good happens in the dream. I=
s that any better? Of course not.
 
On the other hand, if one is slowly get=
ting control over the mind and not weeping as often and not laughing as oft=
en, one is perhaps making progress.
 
*        *        *
 
Do whatever you=
r conscience tells you to do. But expect nothing in return and accept whate=
ver comes to you as a result. As your acceptance increases, the clarity wit=
h which your conscience shows you the path you should take (with regard to =
your actions) will become better and better. If your actions were bad in th=
e past (due to unclear guidelines from conscience or not following your con=
science) and you are receiving bad fruits, you can still overcome it by lea=
rning to accept what comes. As your acceptance is perfected, your conscienc=
e and will power will become pure and your actions will become pure. As act=
ions become pure, newer fruits will be pure. Eventually, you start making p=
rogress.

Narasimha
