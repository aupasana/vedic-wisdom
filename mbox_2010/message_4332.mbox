Namaste Veneet ji,

Nice questions! You can find some answers in the archives. I will briefly
answer again.

On your first point: Yes, Lord Krishna did indeed say in the 10th chapter
of BhagavadGita: "yaGYaanaam japayaGYo.asmi" (of all sacrifices/rituals,
I am the japa yajna, i.e. chanting of mantras).

* * *

We can get it in right perspective by noting that the very previous line
says "I am Om among all mantras".

Yes, Om represents the pure and absolute essence of universe. However, is
it possible for everyone to meditate just using "Om" and reach god?
Probably not. Are Krishna devotees leaving other mantras such as the
mahamantra (Hare krishna mantra) and doing japam only with "Om", because
Krishna said I am "Om" among mantras? Of course, not.

Same thing holds to japam vs other sadhanas such as homam.

Just as one may need ropes and other gear to climb mount everest, one may
need to employ mantras other than "Om" and practices other than "japam"
to overcome one's short-comings and reach the summit of the absolute,
represented by Om (and all other things mentioned by Krishna).

* * *

When you do an external sacrifical ritual such as homam, your body is
engaging in actions. So your mind has to be attached to the body and use
it in a particular way. Can one reach samadhi while doing homam?
Unlikely. One is more likely to reach samadhi when one stops the external
actions. Mind may be withdrawn completely from the body and absorb fully
in the mantra at some stage then.

>From the point of view, japam (sitting still and meditating on a mantra)
is the ultimate sadhana.

However, not everyone can reach god like that. There are so many vasanas
(conditioning) in the mind that needs to be purged/purified slowly. Until
that is done, japam may not help one reach god. Until then, taking the
help of an external pure object (such as fire) that has a purifying
effect on one's subtle consciousness can be helpful. It *prepares* one
for good japam.

* * *

A lot of priests do homam and then leave the fire and go away. In the
homam manuals, I have made it a point to insist that people do japam with
their favorite mantra at the end of the homam, while sitting still with
closed eyes. The idea is that homam purifies subtle consciousness and
*prepares* one for reaching god, while it is finally japam that takes one
to god. After every homam, one's internal purity is at a maximum (a local
maximum, temporally speaking - sorry for the technical jargon) and japam
will be more fruitful than at other times.

* * *

Now onto other questions:

(1) It is unfruitful in the sense that it does not take you closer to
god. It is fruitful in the sense that it stops you from going much
further away from god. After all, if you weren't engaged in that japam
and you were doing some other activity, probably your mind will wander
even more.

I suggest looking at disturbing thoughts in the middle of a japam as a
heckler interrupting your speech. Instead of arguing and fighting with
the heckler, simply take note of him, pause for a second and move on.
Instead of panicking or worrying, simply take note of your thoughts,
pause for a second and move on.

(2) Mantra means that which protects (tra) the mind (mana). Various
vasanas (conditioning) are pulling the mind in different directions to
react to various situations in various ways and that activity tires out
the mind. You protect it by anchoring it in a mantra and teaching it to
overcome the pulls of vasana.

The proof of whether a mantra or japam or homam is working for you or not
is whether there is a slow internal transformation in you or not, whether
your internal reaction to various external things is changing for the
better or not.

(3) Difficult. This is where a good guru is helpful.

Actually, in this age, technical perfection is almost ruled out. I
suggest doing whatever one does with a sense of surrender and humility.
If there is something partly correct that somebody is doing, it will
slowly increase with time and Nature will remove imperfections with time.

(4) I can write Obama's name and Gordon's name on sheets of paper next to
me and pretend that they came there and sat there. Will they really do
it? On the other hand, if I am a world leader holding a summit, probably
I can make them actually come and sit there.

Nyasa means placement. When you do nyasa, you place various vibrations
(sound patterns) or energies (deities) in various body parts. For most of
us with distracted minds, it is merely a formality and means nothing.
Only a sadhaka with a pure, pointed and focused mind can actually place
various vibrations and energies in various body parts.

I always suggest to people to do nyasa as taught by elders (so that the
knowledge lives and is passed on), but not worry too much about it.

As I said, we are in the midst of deepening Kali and the level of
sadhakas is not as high as in the old days. Technical perfection will
become rarer and rarer. It is better to focus on surrender and humility.

Best regards,
Narasimha
