Namaskar,
    Thanks for taking time to answer, because it opens up new thi=
ngs.
Change occurs in Physical, Astral and Causal being, with time, all the=
 time. Making it unchangeable, divine, only means, to realize that the  Aha=
mkara, caught in here and now of being is no more the governing force - and=
 niyati is probably an outcome of cosmic Ahamkara.
         
  Significance=
 of realization at the Physical plane of existence is directly defined by t=
he advantages that it has to offer over other planes of existence. This can=
 be more easily done by drawing an analogy between the time cycles and plan=
es of existence.

  Yuga cycles from Satyuga to KaliYuga and back to Satyug=
a. Kaliyuga not only represents the lowest rung of the ladder, it also prov=
ides a ground for the upward swing of the Yuga cycle.

  Similarly, Physica=
l plane being lowest, provides force and ground for the upward movement of =
soul towards finer planes of existence.

  Both the Yuga Cycles and Planes =
of Existence are the manifestations of Nature, which implies that there is =
more or less an equal distribution of Pros and Cons factors associated with=
 each of them at every level.

  Thus, Physical plane of existence is not a=
 disadvantageous place to realize the Brahman compared to the Mental planes=
 of existence.
  Similarly, divinizing Physical body is not more disadvanta=
geous than divinizing Mind.

  OTOH, it is even more, towards the core thin=
g, to teach the sense of infinite existence to Matter than Mind.
  Satva-Gu=
na Mind is easily conquerable by Jnana.
  When the Tamo-Guna, Matter, is co=
nquered, by Iccha Shakti, what more is left there to conquer?

  Also, it c=
an be noted that when avatars like Rama face difficulties in Physical body,=
 like being hit by shakti in the war, the only great remedy is to conquer T=
amo-Guna itself like Mahaavatar Babaji has done.

regards,
Aryama

 Yes, if a rishi wanted, he could've summoned Rudra to finish off Ravana or=
 Hiranyakashipu. But, a rishi is in bliss no matter what and does not break=
 divine rhythm. If Sita, Rama and Hanuman have to come to earth and establi=
