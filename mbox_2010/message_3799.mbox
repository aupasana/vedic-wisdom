Dear Rajarshi,

As you finally said, Karma is exceedingly complex. I do not=
 know if `Dry Intellect' (The one without a certain level of Realization) c=
an ever break the code of the karma software.

I would think of responding =
to our one query filtering it from all those interconnected and too complic=
ated queries.

>And how does one know the fine line between paying debt and=
 >creating a new one?

Consider this real life example.

Take a case study =
- Mr. Fool (FL) Landed some Amount of Money to Mr. 'Very smart'(VS) on basi=
s of trust and for a pious cause. Now it happened so that Mr. VS could not =
repay it due to reasons only known to him. Mr. VS gives many excuses and ma=
ny dates but fails and ultimately does not pay back. Mr. FL is under great =
pressure due to that.
 
Mr. FL can have many options to react in the situat=
ions:

1] Thinking constantly and repenting for the act He can-
   Curse, C=
onstantly follow-up, Mount Abuses, Remain under stress, resort to other tec=
hniques of 'Vasuli' and resorts to many Internal and external activities co=
ncerning that issue.

In this case, He strongly identifies with the Money, =
act of Giving then expecting it back, Repenting etc...

OR

2] Mr. FL can r=
eally grab the golden chance to resort to the implementation of knowledge (=
KIP-Knowledge in Practice) and thinks that it was a Rina which needed to be=
 paid back and practically starts training the mind with that knowledge. He=
 follows up for the money but with the attitude of detachment. Although he =
shows to his family and friends that he is extremely concerned and it was f=
oolish act etc... But in his mind he thinks that it was a rina from some pa=
st life which was fulfilled. He thinks that they were Money of Mother and s=
he will take care. If they needed to come back, she will do it or if they w=
ere to be paid to nullify some past rinas then they will not come back.

Wi=
th the Second Approach, I think, Mr. FL will not Create New Rinas and will =
be able to break free from this particular chain. He may have successfully =
PAID BACK his debt.

With the first Approach, Mr. FL has identified himself=
 very strongly with Money and its ownership and hence all the actions done =
due to that, so He may have created NEW RINAS which will be needed to settl=
ed on a later date.

However I am not sure for what I have written. I think=
 nobody can be sure.

Best Regards,

Utpal

m very much in awe after I learnt that you do chandi homam everyday. You al=
so wrote that it takes about 1.25 hours to 1.5 hours to do your chandi homa=
m. How can you accomplish that feat with 700 ahutis in such a short time? A=
lso, in my case, I do sandhyavandanam with 108 Gayatri (20 minutes)+ganapat=
hi mantra japam 108 times(10 minutes), a short rudra Abhishekam with pachak=
shari, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 minutes) totalling to about 35 - 40 minute=
s daily ritual. Plus I sometimes do special rituals several times a week, t=
hat takes about 1 to 1.5 hours in all. How to integrate these along with ho=
mam? Is Sri vidyopasana different from Chandi homam? Could you please expla=
in what is sri Vidya and how it is to be learnt? I am very motivated to lea=
rn what the Devi Mahatmayam is all about but I also have keen interest in S=
ri Vidya, because I am a musician also and learnt all the nava-avarna krith=
is of Great Muththuswami Dikshitar recently.
