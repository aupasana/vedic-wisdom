Namaste 

I have heard that the New Moon is good as well for meditation. On=
 the topic of Amavasya ...is not the full moon also said to represent 16 ka=
las which is the same as merger of the sun and moon which is again similar =
to Amavasya which is 0 kalas giving rise to the two forms of the mother as =
Kali and Durga.

Theoretically was convinced of this however using modern s=
cience cannot convince myself enough ...gravitation should only slightly in=
crease during a Full moon or New moon. Also it looks like large bodies of w=
ater are suspectible to this effect more than enclosed bodies of water like=
 a human body...

I feel intuitively that maybe people will run berserk on =
full moon and new moon however do not find any real world corroboration of =
the fact.( studies are there for new moon as well which also found no signi=
ficant statistical evidence of the same .... ) 

I know science is the wron=
g tool to try to find an correlation ...maybe it is not even gravitation an=
d maybe some other force but am puzzled why it cannot be manifested in some=
thing tangible as admission rates in a hospital. 


My Core Concern was may=
be it is true that Kali yuga has corrupted the spiritual sciences , astrolo=
gy , calendar and ritual system so much that it is best to proceed with sin=
cere devotion using any simple spiritual sadhana like homa , tarpana or med=
itative practises rather than elaborate rituals , formulas ,intonations etc=
.
