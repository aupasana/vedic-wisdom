Namaste:

Some interesting news:

- Prahlad Jani claims to have survived without food and water for over
seven decades!!  Jani claims a goddess sustains him through nectar
that filters down through a hole in his palate.

- In 2003, Dr. Shah team authenticated Jani's claims and had also
observed that his biological parameters mysteriously remained normal.
