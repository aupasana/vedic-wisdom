Namaste Davyd,
=C2=A0
Welcome to the community.
=C2=A0
I have done a good b=
it of reading, and meditate on a regular basis,
=C2=A0
That is a pretty goo=
d thing to do, IMHO. Why don't you try to do a small homam of Lord SHiva on=
 a regular basis? Meditating infront of a homa-agni is almost 3/4 times mor=
e potent than normal meditation.=C2=A0 
=C2=A0
A lot of people living in th=
e USA do homam's regularly. If it is possible, then give it a shot. Do it f=
or a few months regularly and feel the difference in your state of mind.
=
=C2=A0
-Regards

Hello!

I am an American Hindu, liv=
ing in Houston, Texas. (Texas is in the far southern US, bordering Mexico, =
the country south of us, for anyone unfamiliar.) My devotion has had its up=
s and downs for many years, but I am trying now to get firm in my practice.=


I lived near a Smarta temple in Ohio (a far northern state in the USA, bo=
rdering Canada, the country to the north of us) where I used to go to worsh=
ip on occasion, and had a teacher there who was teaching me some Sanskrit a=
nd a little theology along the way. That was several years ago. Since movin=
g to Texas, I have just discovered that there is a Vedanta center not very =
far from where I live, and I plan to go there when I can.

Philosophically,=
 I hold to advaita vedanta, worshiping Siva as Ishvara. (I may use some wor=
ds in the wrong way, so please excuse and correct me!) I have done a good b=
it of reading, and meditate on a regular basis, but I do lack good groundin=
g in some of the actual day-to-day worship and understanding of mantras and=
 such.

Having been told that this group could help me with some of that, I=
 immediately joined. I trust that you will forgive my ignorance on many, ma=
ny matters!
