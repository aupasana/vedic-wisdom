Namaste Sir,

I can see that you are carrying a lot of baggage and it is =
spilling over into everything you wrote. Please stick to spiritual matters =
as this list is for spirituality and not for discussing the baggage you car=
ry, which makes you dislike a saint and his lineage. Please don't think tha=
t you are so important that one thousand people should spend their time rea=
ding your baggage.

Please stick to the charter of this list. This is my la=
st warning to you.

Best regards,
Narasimha
