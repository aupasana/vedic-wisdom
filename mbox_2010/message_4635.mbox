 About ten days after my arrival I [Annamalai Swami] asked Bhagavan, 'How t=
o
avoid misery?'

This was the first spiritual question I ever asked him.

=
Bhagavan replied, 'Know and always hold onto the Self. Disregard the body
a=
nd the mind. To identify with them is misery. Dive deep into the Heart, the=

source of being and peace, and establish yourself there.'

I then asked hi=
m how I could attain Self-realisation and he gave me a
similar answer: 'If =
you give up identifying with the body and meditate on
the Self, which you a=
lready are, you can attain Self-realisation.'

As I was pondering on these =
remarks Bhagavan surprised me by saying, 'I was
waiting for you. I was wond=
ering when you would come.'

As a newcomer I was still too afraid of him to=
 follow this up by asking how
he knew, or how long he had been waiting. How=
ever, I was delighted to hear
him speak like this because it seemed to indi=
cate that it was my destiny to
stay with him.

A few days later I asked ano=
ther question: 'Scientists have invented and
produced aircraft which can tr=
avel at great speeds in the sky. Why do you
not make and give us a spiritua=
l aircraft in which we can quickly and easily
cross over the sea of samsara=
?'

Ramana Maharshi: 'The path of self-enquiry,' replied Bhagavan, 'is the
=
aircraft you need. It is direct, fast and easy to use. You are already
trav=
elling very quickly towards realisation. It is only because of your mind
th=
at it seems that there is no movement.In the old days, when people first
ro=
de on trains, some of them believed that the trees and countryside were
mov=
ing and that the train was standing still. It is the same with you now.
You=
r mind is making you believe that you are not moving towards
Self-realisati=
on.'
