There are orthodox beliefs of various kinds. But=
, as sadhana matures, people may rise out of them.
 
Take the simple exampl=
e of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. When Kaali temple was inaugurated at Dakshine=
shwar, his brother joined as a priest in Kaali temple and he joined as a pr=
iest in Krishna temple. Because the temple was constructed by Rani Rasmani,=
 a lower caste person, Ramakrishna considered the prasad to be unsuitable f=
or his consumption! Though Rani Rasmani had donated the temple to her famil=
y priest formally and the temple was formally owned by a brahmana so that r=
igid caste rules of the day were satisfied and brahmanas could accept food =
there, Ramakrishna was too orthodox and was not satisfied by the arrangemen=
t. He chose not to accept the prasad at the temple. Instead, he cooked for =
himself everyday while maintaining external purity (i.e. ganges bath before=
 cooking and all that).
 
But, didn't he transform into a highly tolerant a=
nd open-minded saint who shunned orthodoxy? He became so pure that his word=
s were drenched in the nectar or self-realization and were like a modern up=
anishad.
 
Interestingly, Ramakrishna later said that Rani Rasmani was an i=
ncarnation of one of the eight associates of goddess Durga herself! Yet, sh=
e was not good enough for him earlier and he could not eat prasad served at=
 her temple (though he could work there!).
 
Give people who are faithfully=
 following *some* rules, however illogical they may sound to you, a chance.=
 Do not look for the bad things in them. Learn to tolerate the bad or just =
avoid them if you cannot tolerate. Transform if you can, fight if you reall=
y have to and ignore otherwise. Accumulating frustration and anger is unpro=
ductive.
 
Best regards
Narasimha

 What is the solution? Well, become a true brahmana. Again, try to follow a=
 brahmana lifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire=
 to truly become a brahmana by overcoming tendencies of chandalas, shudras,=
 kshatriyas and vaisyas. Irrespective of where one was born and brought up,=
 one will become a brahmana if one follows this. Only brahmanas are qualifi=
ed to play with the karmas of others by giving life-altering advice or by c=
onducting rituals. Again, to be clear, I am not talking about brahmanas by =
birth, but about brahmanas by conduct.
