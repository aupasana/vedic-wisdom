Dear All,
=C2=A0
Interesting chain of mails. Let me add some more comments.=
Sri Karunanidhi was also the person who asked, "Which engineering college d=
id Rama pass out from?". That is horrible. I wonder if anyone in India has =
the guts to publicly come out and ask a similar kind of question about reli=
gious figures of the Abrahamic religions. I find it also weird that people =
start a witch-hunt against Nityananda Swami for his sex scandal, but nothin=
g of that sort happened when Sri Karunanidhi could publicly question the au=
thenticity of the Ramayana and Rama as a God. 
=C2=A0
I personally had no c=
lue who Nityananda Swami was till yesterday when the news broke. He maybe g=
enuine, he may not be. But how are we to judge that? Just because he is cau=
ght having a sexual relation with someone, he suddenly becomes untouchable?=
 In that case what about another very famous 'saint' /'guru' in India, who =
is merely a product of calculated advertisements and intelligent PR machine=
ry, which makes sure that at least 10/15 days in a month his quotes on ever=
y damn subject on the planet (and very shallow quotes if you ask me), or ne=
ws related to him appears in the largest selling english daily in India?=C2=
=A0That is another level of cheating, in my opinion. Why don't I see people=
 trying to witch-hunt such 'sadhus'? Because Hindus are a confused lot. 
=
=C2=A0
As Narasimha says, maybe this was needed for real Dharma to come bac=
k. In which case=C2=A0I sincrely=C2=A0pray to Ma Chamunda that she throws d=
own some more of these money-making, platitude-mouthing, 'sadhus'/'gurus' f=
rom their lofty public pedestals. In this age we don't need 'bhagwans' and =
'sadhus', we need sadhana. Let us do our own=C2=A0sadhana and inspire other=
s to do sadhana and let us sincerely pray to Her to clean up this country o=
nce and for all. 
=C2=A0
-Regards

dear sri ram kishore,
I would like to add a few corrections=
 in regards to our Chief minister
karunanidhi. He doesnt have communist ide=
ology, he is a third rate
immoral character having 3 wives( first wife is n=
o more) and he had
lot of concubines. Dayanidhi maran is karunanidhi' s nep=
hew and not
his brother. If u recollect when Sun TV and its family newspape=
r was
attacked during 2008by karunanidhi' s sun Alagiri(now union chemical
=
minister) three of the employees of the newspaper died in that violent
atta=
cks. All this happened because the newspaper reported that
people will pref=
er Stalin(karunanidhi' s IInd son) rather than Alagiri.
This dayanidhi mara=
n went on TV saying that perpetrators of this 
violence will be dealt with =
strongly as per law. Over a period of time
patch work was done between the =
two families and now the same
dayanidhi maran has withdrawn the cases filed=
 against Alagiri and
quietly forgotten the loss of three innocent employees=
 lives.
Such people cannot talk abt morality. Karunanidhi has ammassed weal=
th
thro corrupt deals and he is one of the richest family which u may not
s=
ee in communist party. He hates brahmins and he is an anti hindu.
=C2=A0
Co=
ming to the sting operation the whole thing can be a farce or doctored.
It =
is high time Sri Nityananda comes out and tells the truth behind this
episo=
de. As a human he can always denounce Brahmacharyam and get
into Grihasta l=
ife, but if such a desire is strong in his mind then he shud
announce and t=
ell his followers that he is denouncing Brahmacharyam, but
yet he would be =
continuing his spiritual discourses and activity.
I only wish this sting op=
eration is a false and it shud be a lesson to all
these media people who se=
em to sway the minds of the people by
repeated broadcast of such perverted =
material.
=C2=A0
regards,
k.gopu

Utpal ji and Rajarshi ji

Vimalananda says in book1 Page 97=
 Chapter: Shiva

"This is one of the many reasons I hate communism .Communi=
sts are taught to forget their parents ,culture to denounce them .If you de=
stroy your parents and culture which is your root how do you ever expect to=
 prosper "

1.I agree on Tehelka and Sun tv.Both are politically affliated =
entities with parties hell bent on atheism which wait for a chance to use a=
ny occassion to denigrate sanatana dharma. I do not wish to deviate the dis=
cussion but interesting piece of tidbit.Sun tv which brought out the clip i=
s owned by dayanidhi maran brother of Karunanidhi ( Supremo DMK which is a =
carbon copy of Communist ideology) and in today's speech he used the cover =
of this occasion to once again lash out at dharma.

The same Karunanidhi al=
so lashed out at Kanchi Peethadhipathi when the fiasco was ongoing. Hindu n=
ewspaper which is praised by normal people as unbiased was writing articles=
 every day with so called details of misgivings at the ashram....Sense a pa=
ttern ...That is the media war of modern India controlled by vested interes=
ts who would love to see an hindu sanyasi get insulted.Also stakeholders in=
 this drama are the missionary orgs.

2.In Nithyananda' s defense he never =
said he was god . He also never encouraged one to turn away from sex. His a=
dvice was very simple ...when in the physical act keep it physical.As long =
as fantasies are not involved it does not become a addiction. 

He could ve=
ry well be repaying a rna ...or might be involved in a sexual ritual. 

Two=
 of his gurus were an old woman and a female tantrik which he mentions in h=
is youtube video on divine consciousness and feminity.

3.Like Narasimha ji=
 pointed out , he has a very good way of explaining higher level truths.

W=
hat he did or did not do is only his karma alone .This does not take away a=
nything from his lectures or messages.

and like Utpal ji rightly pointed o=
ut...When we are prepared to sit on a high moral horse to judge others...we=
 better be prepared when the divine mother tests us.By juding we will incur=
r a share of the karma others committed and also will be judged quite harsh=
ly when our turn comes.

Regards
Vemparla Ram Kishore
