In one of the books Vimalananda gives out why the real Gayathri is hidden. =
The actually Gayathri generate immense heat which our body can not bear. He=
nce, one should recite it only when one is in water. Also, it makes the per=
son realize self immediately.

I do not really agree God punish people. It =
all depends on the attitude. If you are doing business with God (I will do =
this Sadhana, and hence you give me this result, and you break the sadhana)=
, God may punish.

How ever, if you do sadhana only for self realisation an=
d seek God, God, I am doing sadhana I can, please help me do better and rea=
lise you, God will not punish no matter what. Yes, as Narasimha pointed out=
, in some cases, God may take away certain things to make your spiritual jo=
urney faster, but, that is not really a punishment.

Narasimha, once told m=
e, what you think is good for you or your family may not be really good. On=
ly Ma knows what is good for you. So, don't specify what you want. Let the =
Mother decide what to give.

After all, all of us as parents try to give be=
st to our kids. Don't we? Also, if the child misbehaves, we do not hesitate=
 to punish them. God is no different.

Best regards,
Vijay

 Anything that comes from the Vedas are potent. There must be some reason w=
hy the real Gayatri is hidden. Maybe most people of this age are unfit to c=
hant and then digest the effects of the real Gayatri. I feel, if you like t=
he savitur mantra, keep chanting it. It is also a great sadhana in itself.

nd almost completed the first two. They need a lot more iterations though s=

questions that I have at this point are as follows.

here are quite a few places that left me quite confused too. Maybe with the=
 help of others from the group, I hope to get a better perspective. For ins=

 real Gayatri Mantra is hidden and no one knows. And according to him no on=

t mantra sadhana should be done mentally, with not even tongue moving. I fi=
nd this very difficult to practise. At least for me, mind wanders in a craz=
y fashion if Mantra sadhana is practised silently. In fact, it wanders so m=
uch that I start with Ganapati mantra and somewhere along in the middle of =
japa, I realize that my mind is elsewhere and try to come back to the japam=
. What is shocking to me is that at that time my mind is constantly repeati=
ng Savitru Gayatri Mantra and not the intended Ganapati mantra. And the ros=
ary keeps moving regardless, so the counts are lost........ .

happen, like the example of Ganapati Mantra Sadhaka dying because of breaki=
ng his celibacy! This kind of examples could potentially scare many people =
from taking to any sadhana at all, in the lack of a proper Guru! And for a =
proper guru, one must keep doing sadhana.... how?
