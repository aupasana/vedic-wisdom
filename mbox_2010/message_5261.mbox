Namaste Atul Ji,

Vimalananda certainly seems like a cool person when we re=
ad about him but to say 
that sometimes he was irritated when he felt that =
his student did not learn well 
is an understatement. Do you recall an inst=
ance from his book when he goes to a 
cave to perform a sadhana and finds s=
omewhere else there? After a brief 
argument, when the other sadhu would no=
t budge,=C2=A0he dies! Similarly when Robert 
Svoboda does not acknowledge =
Vimalnanda during a TV interview, Vimalananda goes 
mad inspite of Robert t=
rying to explain his reasons for not acknowledging him. 
Vimalanada did not=
 like to draw attention to himself and secondly he was 
sick,=C2=A0and that=
 was the reason why Robert did not acknowledge any help he had 
received fr=
om Vimalananda - to avoid people crowding at his door, but 
Vimalananda cou=
ld not be pacified and had the TV transmission disabled at the 
time the in=
terview was going to be aired. Why was Vimalananda seeking 
acknowledgement=
 even when he claims he does not like public attention! Probably 
transmiss=
ion breaking down was again part of divine will you think? Robert 
Sbvoboda=
 himself mentions in the opening chapter that dealing with Vimalananda 
was=
 impossible especially when one knows he is wrong but will never admit to h=
is 
mistake.

Then there was the story of his Senior Guru Maharaj has was d=
enied audience by a 
sick sadhu. The senior guru maharaj is so insulted by =
this, he curses this ill 
sadhu with lifetime of that sickness and that sad=
hu finally succumbs to that and 
dies! Now if I like to meet somebody and a=
m denied audience, do I curse them to 
death?

The examples I give above do=
es not illustrate a picture of people who were 
compassionate and always wi=
lling to forgive and forget. But still, they were 
hugely successful in the=
ir sadhana in their own way. And that is what we are 
talking about here...=
.the pre-requisite to success in sadhana. Nobody here I 
thinks expects to =
acheive liberation repeating a few rounds of rosary for a 
particular mantr=
a....but certianly what is required such that our sadhana 
produces results=
 that are easily noticeable to us. I am getting a feeling though 
that ther=
e is really no prerequisite or nobody really knows those 
pre-requisites. I=
 guess once just hasd to put in their best effort and continue 
without to =
let things unfold themselves=C2=A0gradually.

Thanks,
Bhupendra.

=C2=A0 
Respected Bhu=
pendra ji and Narasimha ji,

I am not able enough to say anything and still=
 an ignorant flick but I want to 
add my two cents with a hope that you wil=
l forgive me for my mistakes.

As you know that sadhna increase flow of spi=
ritual energy in our subtle body and 
for accomodating that increased inten=
sity and flow of spiritual energy we need 
clean and open channels. ( or na=
dis - sorry if i am choosing bad words) if those 
channels are not clean th=
en that energy flow can create unpleasant experiences 
like increased anger=
, lust etc. and opposite if channels are clean enough.

Rishis have clean c=
hannels and they flow along with divine will. curses and 
blessings they gi=
ve are just part of divine will. like curse given to lord 
vishnu by sage n=
arda which led to ramayana. similarly curses given to yadav 
vansh and king=
 prikshit played an important role. vimlananda was a cool guy 
except few t=
imes when he was markedly irritated.Like in an incidence where one 
of his =
female disciple tried to illude him by coming almost naked in front of 
him=
 to learn how to become a bhairavi. he was irritated because he felt that h=
is 
student did not learnt well what he taught to her. 


On other side peo=
ple with some impurities like i-ness and pride may not be able 
to handle t=
hat energy well. and can experience increased anger lust etc. like 
ravana =
and sadhaka u are mentioning. Although i personally believe that this is 
a=
lso part of divine will. 


Please forgive me for my mistakes

Regards
Atul=
