Namate friends,


Note: A major constraint in writing on certain topics=
 related to sadhana (esp mantras) is how much and what to put in writing in=
 a public forum. There are bound to be various perspectives and this may di=
stract or confuse the initial practitioner. Moreover the tyranny of over-in=
tellectualization has to be kept in mind. To any such reader my advice is- =
please follow what you are doing currently. Things will evolve and happen o=
n their own accord. Whatever is suited to you will happen in the natural fl=
ow of Life.        

In this post I will also touch upon certain other topi=
cs raised in some related posts while primarily addressing Rajarshi ji's qu=
eries.


>>>I had talked to a few people who adhere to different paramparas=
 >>>within the broader subset of Kalikula. They said that the >>>initiation=
 in Chandi sadhana in required for not only the parayana >>>but also (mostl=
y?) because of the main mantra. Normally we are >>>accustomed with only the=
 navarna mantra, but there are various >>>other mantras of the different as=
pects of the Universal Chandi, of >>>which the navarna we know of, is proba=
bly the mildest. To chant >>>one of these mantras and awaken the same needs=
 initiation. This, >>>they said, is a part of the >>>entire Chandi sadhana.=
 What is your >>opinion on this?>>>



Broadly speaking most of the above i=
s true from the traditional *Sakta* perspective. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana as =
enjoined by Kalikula emphasises MANTRA sadhana. Merely chanting the Devi Ma=
hatmyam text is not the same as Sri Sri Chandi sadhana, as per this view. I=
t has various mantric nuances and practices including other mantras and bij=
as and ways to make them work. I will expand on this at the end of this pos=
t after addressing your other points.



>>>As a corollary to your above pa=
ragraph, one can therefore read the >>>text of the Chandi in a pouranik app=
roach, as a sacred myth? There >>>are people, specially in Bengal, who do a=
 Chandipath on their own >>>without having undergone any formal initiation.=
 How good or bad is >>>this practise?


As always there will be varied beli=
efs and opinions ranging from the very rigid traditional extreme to the ver=
y liberal and casual new-age extreme based on one's personal affiliations, =
family and cultural influences. I will speak for *myself*. I prefer the mod=
erate view that is respectful to tradition but does not allow tradition to =
be one more fetter. 
 
Quite often many of our beliefs are fear-based rathe=
r than knowledge-based. However undigested, unassimilated and unharmonised =
information gathered from the internet or even the print media is not knowl=
edge. There is no need to be fearful as long as one is not experimenting wi=
th mantramarga based on fragmented information gathered from books or worse=
 still the internet. As long as one does the parayana along with other supp=
ortive practices such as kirtan, swadhyaya, reflection and bhakti bhava, in=
itiation need not be a binding factor. However if one wishes to do Sri Sri =
Chandi sadhana in a full-fledged manner as per the traditional Sakta perspe=
ctive, better be initiated. If one strongly wills it (sankalpa) and is suit=
ed to it, the external guru and initiation will happen on their own accord.=
 For the rest who are not predominantly suited to or inclined towards mantr=
amarga, this discussion is not relevant. 


>>>There >>>are people, special=
ly in Bengal, who do a Chandipath on >>>their own >>>without having undergo=
ne any formal initiation. How >>>good or bad is >>>this practise?


Bengal =
is one of the areas of the subcontinent where Kalikula flourished in a full=
-fledged manner at one time. So at the collective level Kalikula is deeply =
embedded in the collective unconscious and thereby the tendency to do Chand=
ipath irrespective of initiation. To undertand this one needs to appreciate=
 the dynamics between Kundalini and *KULA* KUNDALINII which are akin to the=
 individual unconscious and collective unconscious. If a particular family/=
significant member of the family has practiced the sadhana of a devata for =
sometime, the descendants automatically have its influence in their unconsc=
ious. That is why we are advised to worship the kuladevata along with ishta=
 devata though ishta devata remains a major focus. The same applies to para=
yana too. Bengal was at one time a hotbed for the living and breathing trad=
ition of Kalikula. Though we do not see its flowering at the same level or =
in the same form today, at the unseen and unconscious collective level, the=
 age-old Kalikula is very much alive and breathing.  

Spiritual life is al=
l about Awareness and oversimplifying it further, making the unconscious co=
nscious is what Awareness is about. In true Advaitic fashion the collective=
 and individual consciousness are not separate. The advent of Sri Ramakrish=
na is a predictable culmination of the flowering of Kalikula at a collectiv=
e level. His advent marks a major milestone in not just Kalikula sadhana bu=
t Sakta sadhana itself. Irrespective of the physical death of Sri Ramakrish=
na, his satsangha is possible for all sincere seekers. Whilst swadhyaya of =
the Kathamrta is the easiest way to revel in his Satsangha, it is possible =
to connect with him through a combination of trust (sraddha) and sense of b=
elongingness too. If you consider him as your APTA, he automatically become=
s your apta at a manasik level. This sense of belongingness straightaway op=
ens the doors of your heart and makes his grace and protection possible. 

=
In view of the above discussed factors, it might be okay to do Chandi paray=
ana without initiation, in our times. Initiation could happen in the long r=
un if it is meant to be. However traditionally speaking Sri Sri Chandipath =
without initiation is unimaginable as Sri Sri Chandi's integrated sadhana i=
ncludes various other mantras and bijas that are generally not written in t=
exts though some texts talk about them without giving the complete details.=
 Diksha includes all this and much more. Here a word on `diksha' itself is =
in order to clarify the difference between uninitiated Devi Mahatmya paraya=
na and initiated Sri Sri Chandi sadhana.  

Diksha differs in accordance wi=
th the sampradaya or the lineage within Kalikula or Srikula. To understand =
`diksha' itself, one needs to examine certain differences (bhedas), of whic=
h the following are most important:
 
1. Guru Parampara:  This forms the co=
re of Devi Upasana and the other bhedas (differences) are in a way based on=
 this.

2. Sampradaya: Guru of any authentic lineage should necessarily bel=
ong to one of the recognized sampradayas. 

3. Diksha: Depending on the dis=
ciple's eligibility and the Guru's capability, the type of diksha too varie=
s. 
 
4. Yaga Bheda:  There are four levels of Yajna or yaga - Antaryaga, B=
ahiryaga,Mahayaga and Rahoyaga. Guru initiates the disciple into one or mor=
e of these paths depending on the adhikara (aptitudes, needs and capabiliti=
es) of the sadhaka. Only antaryaga and bahiryaga are relevant to our discus=
sion. I have already expanded on this in another post on Yajna. 

5. Devata=
 Bheda:  Though the Devi is only One, depending on the samskara and vasana =
of the initiate, he is initiated into the worship of Kali or Sri and thus t=
he paths of Kalikula and Srikula or Kalividya and Srividya. 
 
6. Achara Bh=
eda:  Depending on the initiate's samskara and adhikara, broadly speaking t=
here are seven acharas- Vedachara, Vaisnavachara, Saivachara, Dakshinachara=
, Vamachara, Siddhantachara , and Kaulachara. Within the framework of Sakta=
 sadhana, there are only three acharas- Samaya, Dakshina and Kaulachara. It=
 is highly misleading to speak of the *superiority* of one achara over the =
other. The path, the chosen form of the Mother (Kali or Sri), the means of =
worship, are all differently devised to suit the varying temperaments of th=
e practitioners. All forms of the Devi and all paths of sadhana are equally=
 respectable and ancient enough. The differences pertain more to the practi=
tioner and NOT TO THE DIVINITY. As such we are advised not to degrade or cr=
iticize any path or deity.  All upasanas lead to the Devi and all sadhakas =
have the Devi within them. To talk lowly of any other sadhana marga or rupa=
 of the Devi amounts to insulting the Devi Herself.  As Sri Bhaskararaya ob=
serves with characteristic tolerance, "all vidyas are not different, a comp=
arison of one to another (in the texts) is merely for the sake of praising =
and encouraging its performance". One could as well extend this tolerance (=
if not acceptance) to all forms of God and all paths of attaining Her/Him. =
In the ultimate reckoning, any division is relative as there is only the ON=
E. Advaita is the true essence of Sakta sadhana. All paths are practically =
along a *circular* continuum. An intellectual debate on the differences bet=
ween various paths is irrelevant to sadhana itself though it has relevance =
to academicians or to the respective world-view of the sadhaka. Instead sad=
hakas should focus on the underlying unity of all paths and the ultimate On=
eness of all forms of the Divine. This is a major tenet of Sakta sadhana.
 =
             
7. Mantra Bheda =96 Based on certain factors including the sa=
dhaka's adhikara bheda, he is initiated into a different mantra. It is not =
uncommon that the same sadhaka is initiated into various forms of the mantr=
a progressively in a gradual manner if he persists with commitment. For ins=
tance in Sri Vidya upasana the mantra of Sri has five variant versions- Bal=
a, Panchadashi, Shodashi, Para shodashi and Guhya shodashi. Bala mantra is =
the entry level or preparatory level mantra for Sri Vidya. Likewise the nav=
akshari or navarna mantra too has SEVEN VARIANT versions, of which the Nava=
rna mantra that most written texts include is the mildest and akin to the e=
ntry level Bala mantra in Sri Vidya upasana. 
 
The *details* of the seven =
variant versions of the navakshari or the twelve different ways of doing Sr=
i Sri Chandi path are really unnecessary to our current discussion. Instead=
 in my next post I will write more on MANTRA and its central importance in =
sadhana as per the Sakta world-view. 

Finally a word on `Vak and `artha' t=
oo is in order here. It is true that one derives great benefit by chanting =
a mantra in its original form. No doubt translation of a mantra is NOT the =
same as the mantra in its original form as `vak'. Undoubtedly `Sabda' comes=
 first and then only the `artha' follows ("Artha Srishtaeh Purvam Sabda sru=
shtih"). However one has to bear in mind that `Vak' and `Artha' are interde=
pendent and inseparable. I will elaborate on Sabda/Vak/Artha in my next pos=
t along with Sri Bhaskararaya makhin's commentary and the importance accord=
ed to the fifteen levels of meaning (artha) of a mantra, so much so that he=
 even affirms that, "the mere utterance of sabda without a knowledge of the=
 true import bears no fruit, even as the offering thrown over ashes in the =
absence of fire does not burst into flame". I will examine both sides of `s=
abda' and `artha' in my next post as and when I can. All Indian traditions =
that explore `Vak' or `Sabda' agree that both are inseparable. The very men=
tion of the words `sabda' and `artha' brings to my mind the most beautiful =
mangala sloka from Kalidasa's `Raghuvamsa' wherein he compares the insepara=
ble and interdependent nature of `Vak' and `Artha' to `Siva' and `Sakti' th=
e parents of the entire universe =85.
