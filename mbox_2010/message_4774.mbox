Namaste all learned friends, 

I have a few questions for which I am sincer=
ely seeking answers. The questions pertain to Mathura Bhakti tradition as w=
ell as some very popular works of great sages and saints of our beloved Bha=
rata Varsha. 

1. There is this tradition of envisioning the lord (paramatm=
a) as the only purusha and all the humanity (various jeevatmas) as women an=
d thereby jeevatmas seeking union with paramatma culminating in salvation. =
We have seen examples of great saints like Chaitanya Maha Prabhu who were s=
talwarts of this path. And this explains the Krishna tatva in Srimad bhagav=
atam as well in gopika vastra apaharana / rasaleela episodes. While I think=
 I understand this concept very well, I find it very hard to explain it 1. =
To someone who is foreign to our culture and 2. To people who intentionally=
 malign the image of our rich Vedic traditions and 3. To kids who might com=
e up with questions on this subject. What is the best way to explain it in =
these situations? 

2. In Lalitha Sahasranama stotra as well as Saundarya L=
ahari stotra, Veda Vyasa and Adi Sankara respectively have described the mo=
ther goddess in a very detailed way detailing on specific body parts. Yes, =
undoubtedly they have envisioned the formless nirguna Brahman as their belo=
ved mother, but where from is this tradition anga-anga varnana (part - by p=
art description) of mother? While I have no problem in accepting those and =
include those in my daily prayers, how do we sensibly / convincingly explai=
n these to the above groups of people? 

Not only in these, I find referenc=
e to woman's body parts quite liberally in most of the ancient sanskrit / t=
elugu literature and I want to know why? Examples are Sri Krishna Ashtakam,=
 Venkateshwara stotra that follows soon after Suprabhata (kamala kucha choo=
chuka kumkumatO ....) and so on. 

Pardon me if I am sounding naive... But =
having to teach some of these to a teenage kid... I really do not know how =
to approach, in case of any questions! 

Regards, 

Nagraj
