namaste,

Some scholars pronounce the anusvAra which precedes the ya-kAra a=
s a
nAsalized ya-kAra. i.e. tryambaka{y}yajAmahe. I suspect that this is
wh=
at the scholars were trying to say, but something got lost in
translation.

bhavadiiyaH,

Dear Narasimha ji and other Sanskrit scholars on this list.

I have been debating with a friend over the pronunciation of the Maha Mritu=

end is stationed in India and associates with Sanskrit scholars that tell h=
im that the pronunciation of these first words of the mantra is: "Tryambaka=
yajamahe" This version skips the Anusvara "M" and the logic given is that a=
 Sandhi rule is applied when the ending of one word is "am" and beginning o=
f another is "ya"!

ritten in the Rk Veda (Mandala 7, Sukta 59, Rica 12). Would the mantra be w=
ritten in the Veda without the intended Sandhi applied?
>>
>> Narasimha, on=
 your website your rendering is in agreement with what I thought was the tr=
ue mantra. Are the Sandhi rules to be applied between all words in Sanskrit=
 or are there exceptions?
