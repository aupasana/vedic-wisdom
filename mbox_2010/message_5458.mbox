When we lookback with a bit of matured thinking compared to our childhood d=
ays, everybody would feel that we should have helped the poor guy who has c=
ome for some small help which could have brought sea change in that person'=
s life.  This type of feeling will flash to almost everybody's mind oneday =
or the other. At this juncture I am always reminded of the following text I=
 have come acrossed while going through one book of Sri B V Raman.
I quote =

                  "POVERTY
""Poverty is a horrible spectre more grim-like =
than death.  Death puts an end to life and settle all worldly states.  What=
 happens after death,  nobody knows.  It is supposed to put an end to all t=
he worldly miseries.  Sorrows and anxieties.  Hence  there are  some people=
 who prefer death to abject poverty.  A poor man leads a wretched life.  He=
 is compelled to live in squalid and unhealthy houses.  The children have n=
o facilities for education, health and decent existence.  The poor man is g=
enerally shunned everywhere.  He is an unwelcome guest at the doors of the =
`well-to-do-`classes  His legitimate activities are obstructed by financial=
 difficulties and want of sympathy.  Poverty is a hot-bed of crime and vice=
 and the impervious sensation of hunger and thirst drive the poor to disgra=
ceful acts.  Whatever philosophers may say, the pangs of poverty are diffic=
ult to bear.""
Curtesy----Sri B V RAMAN

It would be great help to the need=
y if we can do some  help when approached / as and when we get opportunity =
of helping the needy person. It will be definitely pleasing the GOD.  We ma=
y call it donation, dharmam as is called in Sanathana Dharma .  Several peo=
ple became poor to verypoor families over generations  for various 
reasons=
 (BATHIKI CHEDDA VALLU). They may not even approach anybody
for the sake of=
 false prestige(EGO Factor).

My humble request is try to help the needy wh=
ich need not involve financial support always.  Even giving moral support a=
lso counts a lot some times.

Atleast let us have sympathy for the poor for=
 their present state and cooperate for their survivol/uplifting .
Finally w=
e have to accept that Nature is always right and whatever we do we only rea=
p the fruits of our actions/inactions. KARMA SIDHANTHAM....asmurthy
