Utpal ji and Raj=
arshi ji

Vimalananda says in book1 Page 97 Chapter: Shiva

"This is one of=
 the many reasons I hate communism .Communists are taught to forget their p=
arents ,culture to denounce them .If you destroy your parents and culture w=
hich is your root how do you ever expect to prosper "

1.I agree on Tehelka=
 and Sun tv.Both are politically affliated entities with parties hell bent =
on atheism which wait for a chance to use any occassion to denigrate sanata=
na dharma. I do not wish to deviate the discussion but interesting piece of=
 tidbit.Sun tv which brought out the clip is owned by dayanidhi maran broth=
er of Karunanidhi ( Supremo DMK which is a carbon copy of Communist ideolog=
y) and in today's speech he used the cover of this occasion to once again l=
ash out at dharma.

The same Karunanidhi also lashed out at Kanchi Peethadh=
ipathi when the fiasco was ongoing. Hindu newspaper which is praised by nor=
mal people as unbiased was writing articles every day with so called detail=
s of misgivings at the ashram....Sense a pattern ...That is the media war o=
f modern India controlled by vested interests who would love to see an hind=
u sanyasi get insulted.Also stakeholders in this drama are the missionary o=
rgs.

2.In Nithyananda' s defense he never said he was god . He also never =
encouraged one to turn away from sex. His advice was very simple ...when in=
 the physical act keep it physical.As long as fantasies are not involved it=
 does not become a addiction. 

He could very well be repaying a rna ...or =
might be involved in a sexual ritual. 

Two of his gurus were an old woman =
and a female tantrik which he mentions in his youtube video on divine consc=
iousness and feminity.

3.Like Narasimha ji pointed out , he has a very goo=
d way of explaining higher level truths.

What he did or did not do is only=
 his karma alone .This does not take away anything from his lectures or mes=
sages.

and like Utpal ji rightly pointed out...When we are prepared to sit=
 on a high moral horse to judge others...we better be prepared when the div=
ine mother tests us.By juding we will incurr a share of the karma others co=
mmitted and also will be judged quite harshly when our turn comes.
