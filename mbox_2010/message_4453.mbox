Dear Rajarshi Da and VemparlaRamkishore ji,

I can contribute some thoughts=
, if someone perform Sadhana, things get answered within our mind automatic=
ally, its really amazing...if someone needs to wear gemstones/Yantra/Mantra=
/Good Deeds/Fasting or whatever, those are automatically happen, even somet=
imes dramatically...

Saab Taar Khela...Jai Ma...

Biswajit

l is found in many ancient religions. Unlike the elements of earth, water a=

. The Sanskrit name for fire is paavaka, i.e. purifier. Fire is a living go=
d that everyone has access to. Spending time worshipping god through fire p=
urifies one's subtle consciousness. Homam is far more effective than most o=
ther sadhanas in improving one's focus, changing one's inner personality an=

Brihat Paaraasara Horaa Saastram" just before the advent of Kali yuga, for =

In fact, most remedies he recommended involve homam. Parasara asked to foll=
