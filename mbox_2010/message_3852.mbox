I notice this discussion has been mostly among men, many of whom appear to
=
be married. I would like to point out that brahmacharya should not be taken=

as a unilateral decision and that the wife's sexual needs also be honored
=
and respected (whether verbally articulated or not). Even Ramakrishna
offer=
ed Sarada that he would give up his sexual abstinence in order to
fulfill h=
is husbandly dharma towards her. Grhastha dharma in many of our
scriptures =
enjoins certain restrictions upon sexual behavior (e.g., not
during Ekadasi=
 or other certain days, or so many days after a woman's menses
has ended, e=
tc.), which are short of extended periods of sexual celibacy but
neverthele=
ss accomplish the same ends (gradually, over time) of channeling
healthily,=
 controlling, and then overcoming the desire for sex. Also,
forcible repres=
sion can have the opposite effet--flaring up of strong sexual
urges that ca=
n be more problematic later on if healthy release is not
allowed. A lot of =
problems in the Catholic church, ISKCON and now BAPS are
attributable to th=
is.
