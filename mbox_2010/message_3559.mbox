Dear Narasimhaji and all,

   -I have been wanting to ask this for some tim=
e.. since I have not been really confortable while doing varshodhara , the =
shloka contains words like 
      ... Mrutham cha me... Bhayam Cha me.. etc=
.  Is it not like saying 'give me death and give me fear'  Should it not be=
 like '... Amrutham cha me... Abhayam cha me ie 'Give me immortality... giv=
e me refuge'. I see that there is 'S' in sloka in the sanskrit version, doe=
s this mean the word 'Aah' should be prefixed to it wherever it is present?=


  - In Shiva Homa using Sri Rudram Chamakam, I was thinking it would be b=
etter doing the main homa with Sri Rudram and Varshodhara with Chamakam. Is=
 this right?

Thanks
Shasi
