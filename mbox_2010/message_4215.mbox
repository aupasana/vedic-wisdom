Dear Varun

Stephen Knapp has written a famous book on Proof of Vedic civil=
ization. Here is the link and he hosts many photographs on his site of arch=
itecture found in mosques in persia and other places.

50 yrs ago All the s=
o called Historians were on the Bandwagon of the western repeated Aryan Inv=
asion theory which was an western fabrication that Indian achievements and =
the Vedas were written by Europeans. Today genetic evidence proves otherwis=
e with the Haplo Marker M16 gene unveiled by the great scientist Stephen Op=
penheimer in his garden of eden series.

So My two cents is...If Western re=
gurgigated history is the proof for everything a lot of untruths can pass a=
s the truth for a long time.

f a volume known as =E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=80=99 treasured in the Makhta=
b-e-Sultania library in Istanbul, Turkey. Rendered in free English the insc=
ription says: 
> "Fortunate are those who were born (and lived) during king=
 Vikram=E2=80=99s reign. He was a noble, generous dutiful ruler, devoted to=
 the welfare of his subjects. But at that time we Arabs, oblivious of God, =
were lost in sensual pleasures. Plotting and torture were rampant. The dark=
ness of ignorance had enveloped our country. Like the lamb struggling for h=
er life in the cruel paws of a wolf we Arabs were caught up in ignorance. T=
he entire country was enveloped in a darkness so intense as on a new moon n=
ight. But the present dawn and pleasant sunshine of education is the result=
 of the favour of the noble king Vikramaditya whose benevolent supervision =
did not lose sight of us- foreigners as we were. He spread his sacred relig=
ion amongst us and sent scholars whose brilliance shone like that of the su=
n from his country to ours. These scholars and preceptors through whose ben=
evolence we were once again made cognisant of the presence of God, introduc=
ed to His sacred
>  existence and put on the road of Truth, had come to our=
 country to preach their religion and impart education at king Vikramaditya=
=E2=80=99s behest." 
> For those who would like to read the Arabic wording =
I reproduce it hereunder in Roman script: 
> "Itrashaphai Santu Ibikramatul=

> (Page 315 Sayar-ul-okul) =
. 
> [Note: The title =E2=80=98Saya-ul-okul=E2=80=99 signifies memorable wo=
rds.] 
> A careful analysis of the above inscription enables us to draw the=
 following conclusions: 
> 1.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 That the ancien=
t Indian empires may have extended up to the eastern boundaries of Arabia u=
ntil Vikramaditya and that it was he who for the first time conquered Arabi=
a. Because the inscription says that king Vikram who dispelled the darkness=
 of ignorance from Arabia. 
> 2.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 That, whatev=
er their earlier faith, King Vikrama=E2=80=99s preachers had succeeded in s=
preading the Vedic (based on the Vedas, the Hindu sacred scriptures)) way o=
f life in Arabia. 
> 3.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 That the knowledge of=
 Indian arts and sciences was imparted by Indians to the Arabs directly by =
founding schools, academies and cultural centres. The belief, therefore, th=
at visiting Arabs conveyed that knowledge to their own lands through their =
own indefatigable efforts and scholarship is unfounded. 
> An ancillary con=
clusion could be that the so-called Kutub Minar (in Delhi, India) could wel=
l be king Vikramadiya=E2=80=99s tower commemorating his conquest of Arabia.=
 This conclusion is strengthened by two pointers. Firstly, the inscription =
on the iron pillar near the so-called Kutub Minar refers to the marriage of=
 the victorious king Vikramaditya to the princess of Balhika. This Balhika =
is none other than the Balkh region in West Asia. It could be that Arabia w=
as wrestled by king Vikramaditya from the ruler of Balkh who concluded a tr=
eaty by giving his daughter in marriage to the victor. Secondly, the townsh=
ip adjoining the so called Kutub Minar is named Mehrauli after Mihira who w=
as the renowned astronomer-mathemat ician of king Vikram=E2=80=99s court. M=
ehrauli is the corrupt form of Sanskrit =E2=80=98Mihira-Awali=E2=80=99 sign=
ifying a row of houses raised for Mihira and his helpers and assistants wor=
king on astronomical observations made from the tower. 
> Having seen the f=
ar reaching and history shaking implications of the Arabic inscription conc=
erning king Vikrama, we shall now piece together the story of its find. How=
 it came to be recorded and hung in the Kaaba in Mecca. What are the other =
proofs reinforcing the belief that Arabs were once followers of the Indian =
Vedic way of life and that tranquillity and education were ushered into Ara=
bia by king Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s scholars, educationists from an uneasy p=
eriod of "ignorance and turmoil" mentioned in the inscription. 
> In Istanb=
ul, Turkey, there is a famous library called Makhatab-e-Sultania , which is=
 reputed to have the largest collection of ancient West Asian literature. I=
n the Arabic section of that library is an anthology of ancient Arabic poet=
ry. That anthology was compiled from an earlier work in A.D. 1742 under the=
 orders of the Turkish ruler Sultan Salim. 
> The pages of that volume are =
of Hareer =E2=80" a kind of silk used for writing on. Each page has a decor=
ative gilded border. That anthology is known as Sayar-ul-Okul. It is divide=
d into three parts. The first part contains biographic details and the poet=
ic compositions of pre-Islamic Arabian poets. The second part embodies acco=
unts and verses of poets of the period beginning just after prophet Mohamma=
d=E2=80=99s times, up to the end of the Banee-Um-Mayya dynasty. The third p=
art deals with later poets up to the end of Khalif Harun-al-Rashid=E2=80=99=
s times. 
> Abu Amir Asamai, an Arabian bard who was the poet Laureate of H=
arun-al-Rashid=E2=80=99s court, has compiled and edited the anthology. 
> T=
he first modern edition of =E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=80=99 was printed and =
published in Berlin in 1864. A subsequent edition is the one published in B=
eirut in 1932. 
> The collection is regarded as the most important and auth=
oritative anthology of ancient Arabic poetry. It throws considerable light =
on the social life, customs, manners and entertainment modes of ancient Ara=
bia. The book also contains an elaborate description of the ancient shrine =
of Mecca, the town and the annual fair known as OKAJ which used to be held =
every year around the Kaaba temple in Mecca. This should convince readers t=
hat the annual haj of the Muslims to the Kaaba is of earlier pre-Islamic co=
ngregation. 
> But the OKAJ fair was far from a carnival. It provided a for=
um for the elite and the learned to discuss the social, religious, politica=
l, literary and other aspects of the Vedic culture then pervading Arabia. =
=E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=80=99 asserts that the conclusion reached at thos=
e discussions were widely respected throughout Arabia. Mecca, therefore, fo=
llowed the Varanasi tradition (of India) of providing a venue for important=
 discussions among the learned while the masses congregated there for spiri=
tual bliss. The principal shrines at both Varanasi in India and at Mecca in=
 Arvasthan (Arabia) were Siva temples. Even to this day ancient Mahadev (Si=
va) emblems can be seen. It is the Shankara (Siva) stone that Muslim pilgri=
ms reverently touch and kiss in the Kaaba. 
> Arabic tradition has lost tra=
ce of the founding of the Kaaba temple. The discovery of the Vikramaditya i=
nscription affords a clue. King Vikramaditya is known for his great devotio=
n to Lord Mahadev (Siva). At Ujjain (India), the capital of Vikramaditya, e=
xists the famous shrine of Mahankal, i.e., of Lord Shankara (Siva) associat=
ed with Vikramaditya. Since according to the Vikramaditya inscription he sp=
read the Vedic religion, who else but he could have founded the Kaaba templ=
e in Mecca? 
> A few miles away from Mecca is a big signboard which bars th=
e entry of any non-Muslim into the area. This is a reminder of the days whe=
n the Kaaba was stormed and captured solely for the newly established faith=
 of Islam. The object in barring entry of non-Muslims was obviously to prev=
ent its recapture. 
> As the pilgrim proceeds towards Mecca he is asked to =
shave his head and beard and to don special sacred attire that consists of =
two seamless sheets of white cloth. One is to be worn round the waist and t=
he other over the shoulders. Both these rites are remnants of the old Vedic=
 practice of entering Hindu temples clean- and with holy seamless white she=
ets. 
> The main shrine in Mecca, which houses the Siva emblem, is known as=
 the Kaaba. It is clothed in a black shroud. That custom also originates fr=
om the days when it was thought necessary to discourage its recapture by ca=
mouflaging it. 
> According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, the Kaaba has =
360 images. Traditional accounts mention that one of the deities among the =
360 destroyed when the place was stormed, was that of Saturn; another was o=
f the Moon and yet another was one called Allah. That shows that in the Kaa=
ba the Arabs worshipped the nine planets in pre-Islamic days. In India the =
practice of =E2=80=98Navagraha=E2=80=99 puja, that is worship of the nine p=
lanets, is still in vogue. Two of these nine are Saturn and Moon. 
> In Ind=
ia the crescent moon is always painted across the forehead of the Siva symb=
ol. Since that symbol was associated with the Siva emblem in Kaaba it came =
to be grafted on the flag of Islam. 
> Another Hindu tradition associated w=
ith the Kaaba is that of the sacred stream Ganga (sacred waters of the Gang=
es river). According to the Hindu tradition Ganga is also inseparable from =
the Shiva emblem as the crescent moon. Wherever there is a Siva emblem, Gan=
ga must co-exist. True to that association a sacred fount exists near the K=
aaba. Its water is held sacred because it has been traditionally regarded a=
s Ganga since pre-Islamic times (Zam-Zam water). 
> [Note: Even today, Musl=
im pilgrims who go to the Kaaba for Haj regard this Zam-Zam water with reve=
rence and take some bottled water with them as sacred water.] 
> Muslim pil=
grims visiting the Kaaba temple go around it seven times. In no other mosqu=
e does the circumambulation prevail. Hindus invariably circumambulate aroun=
d their deities. This is yet another proof that the Kaaba shrine is a pre-I=
slamic Indian Shiva temple where the Hindu practice of circumambulation is =
still meticulously observed. 
> The practice of taking seven steps- known a=
s Saptapadi in Sanskrit- is associated with Hindu marriage ceremony and fir=
e worship. The culminating rite in a Hindu marriage enjoins upon the bride =
and groom to go round the sacred fire four times (but misunderstood by many=
 as seven times). Since "Makha" means fire, the seven circumambulations als=
o prove that Mecca was the seat of Indian fire-worship in the West Asia. 
>=
 It might come as a stunning revelation to many that the word =E2=80=98ALLA=
H=E2=80=99 itself is Sanskrit. In Sanskrit language Allah, Akka and Amba ar=
e synonyms. They signify a goddess or mother. The term =E2=80=98ALLAH=E2=80=
=99 forms part of Sanskrit chants invoking goddess Durga, also known as Bha=
vani, Chandi and Mahishasurmardini. The Islamic word for God is., therefore=
, not an innovation but the ancient Sanskrit appellation retained and conti=
nued by Islam. Allah means mother or goddess and mother goddess. 
> One Kor=
anic verse is an exact translation of a stanza in the Yajurveda. This was p=
ointed out by the great research scholar Pandit Satavlekar of Pardi in one =
of his articles. 
> [Note: Another scholar points out that the following te=
aching from the Koran is exactly similar to the teaching of the Kena Upanis=

> The ident=
ity of Unani and Ayurvedic systems shows that Unani is just the Arabic term=
 for the Ayurvedic system of healing taught to them and administered in Ara=
bia when Arabia formed part of the Indian empire. 
> It will now be easy to=
 comprehend the various Hindu customs still prevailing in West Asian countr=
ies even after the existence of Islam during the last 1300 years. Let us re=
view some Hindu traditions which exist as the core of Islamic practice. 
> =
The Hindus have a pantheon of 33 gods. People in Asia Minor too worshipped =
33 gods before the spread of Islam. The lunar calendar was introduced in We=
st Asia during the Indian rule. The Muslim month =E2=80=98Safar=E2=80=99 si=
gnifying the =E2=80=98extra=E2=80=99 month (Adhik Maas) in the Hindu calend=
ar. The Muslim month Rabi is the corrupt form of Ravi meaning the sun becau=
se Sanskrit =E2=80=98V=E2=80=99 changes into Prakrit =E2=80=98B=E2=80=99 (P=
rakrit being the popular version of Sanskrit language). The Muslim sanctity=
 for Gyrahwi Sharif is nothing but the Hindu Ekadashi (Gyrah =3D elevan or =
Gyaarah). Both are identical in meaning. 
> The Islamic practice of Bakari =
Eed derives from the Go-Medh and Ashva-Medh Yagnas or sacrifices of Vedic t=
imes. Eed in Sanskrit means worship. The Islamic word Eed for festive days,=
 signifying days of worship, is therefore a pure Sanskrit word. The word ME=
SH in the Hindu zodiac signifies a lamb. Since in ancient times the year us=
ed to begin with the entry of the sun in Aries, the occasion was celebrated=
 with mutton feasting. That is the origin of the Bakari Eed festival. 
> [N=
ote: The word Bakari is an Indian language word for a goat.] 
> Since Eed m=
eans worship and Griha means =E2=80=98house=E2=80=99, the Islamic word Idga=
h signifies a =E2=80=98House of worship=E2=80=99 which is the exact Sanskri=
t connotation of the term. Similarly the word =E2=80=98Namaz=E2=80=99 deriv=
es from two Sanskrit roots =E2=80=98Nama=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98Yajna=E2=80=
=99 (NAMa yAJna) meaning bowing and worshipping. 
> Vedic descriptions abou=
t the moon, the different stellar constellations and the creation of the un=
iverse have been incorporated from the Vedas in Koran part 1 chapter 2, sta=
nza 113, 114, 115, and 158, 189, chapter 9, stanza 37 and chapter 10, stanz=
as 4 to 7. 
> Recital of the Namaz five times a day owes its origin to the =
Vedic injunction of Panchmahayagna (five daily worship- Panch-Maha-Yagna) w=
hich is part of the daily Vedic ritual prescribed for all individuals. 
> M=
uslims are enjoined cleanliness of five parts of the body before commencing=
 prayers. This derives from the Vedic injuction =E2=80=98Shareer Shydhyarth=
am Panchanga Nyasah=E2=80=99. 
> Four months of the year are regarded as ve=
ry sacred in Islamic custom. The devout are enjoined to abstain from plunde=
r and other evil deeds during that period. This originates in the Chaturmas=
a i.e., the four-month period of special vows and austerities in Hindu trad=
ition. Shabibarat is the corrupt form of Shiva Vrat and Shiva Ratra. Since =
the Kaaba has been an important centre of Shiva (Siva) worship from times i=
mmemorial, the Shivaratri festival used to be celebrated there with great g=
usto. It is that festival which is signified by the Islamic word Shabibarat=
. 
> Encyclopaedias tell us that there are inscriptions on the side of the =
Kaaba walls. What they are, no body has been allowed to study, according to=
 the correspondence I had with an American scholar of Arabic. But according=
 to hearsay at least some of those inscriptions are in Sanskrit, and some o=
f them are stanzas from the Bhagavad Gita. 
> According to extant Islamic r=
ecords, Indian merchants had settled in Arabia, particularly in Yemen, and =
their life and manners deeply influenced those who came in touch with them.=
 At Ubla there was a large number of Indian settlements. This shows that In=
dians were in Arabia and Yemen in sufficient strength and commanding positi=
on to be able to influence the local people. This could not be possible unl=
ess they belonged to the ruling class. 
> It is mentioned in the Abadis i.e=
., the authentic traditions of Prophet Mohammad compiled by Imam Bukhari th=
at the Indian tribe of Jats had settled in Arabia before Prophet Mohammad=
=E2=80=99s times. Once when Hazrat Ayesha, wife of the Prophet, was taken i=
ll, her nephew sent for a Jat physician for her treatment. This proves that=
 Indians enjoyed a high and esteemed status in Arabia. Such a status could =
not be theirs unless they were the rulers. Bukhari also tells us that an In=
dian Raja (king) sent a jar of ginger pickles to the Prophet. This shows th=
at the Indian Jat Raja ruled an adjacent area so as to be in a position to =
send such an insignificant present as ginger pickles. The Prophet is said t=
o have so highly relished it as to have told his colleagues also to partake=
 of it. These references show that even during Prophet Mohammad=E2=80=99s t=
imes Indians retained their influential role in Arabia, which was a dwindli=
ng legacy from Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s times. 
> The Islamic term =E2=80=98E=
ed-ul-Fitr=E2=80=99 derives from the =E2=80=98Eed of Piters=E2=80=99 that i=
s worship of forefathers in Sanskrit tradition. In India, Hindus commemorat=
e their ancestors during the Pitr-Paksha that is the fortnight reserved for=
 their remembrance. The very same is the significance of =E2=80=98Eed-ul-Fi=
tr=E2=80=99 (worship of forefathers) . 
> The Islamic practice of observing=
 the moon rise before deciding on celebrating the occasion derives from the=
 Hindu custom of breaking fast on Sankranti and Vinayaki Chaturthi only aft=
er sighting the moon. 
> Barah Vafat, the Muslim festival for commemorating=
 those dead in battle or by weapons, derives from a similar Sanskrit tradit=
ion because in Sanskrit =E2=80=98Phiphaut=E2=80=99 is =E2=80=98death=E2=80=
=99. Hindus observe Chayal Chaturdashi in memory of those who have died in =
battle. 
> The word Arabia is itself the abbreviation of a Sanskrit word. T=
he original word is =E2=80=98Arabasthan=E2=80=99. Since Prakrit =E2=80=98B=
=E2=80=99 is Sanskrit =E2=80=98V=E2=80=99 the original Sanskrit name of the=
 land is =E2=80=98Arvasthan=E2=80=99. =E2=80=98Arva=E2=80=99 in Sanskrit me=
ans a horse. Arvasthan signifies a land of horses., and as well all know, A=
rabia is famous for its horses. 
> This discovery changes the entire comple=
xion of the history of ancient India. Firstly we may have to revise our con=
cepts about the king who had the largest empire in history. It could be tha=
t the expanse of king Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s empire was greater than that o=
f all others. Secondly, the idea that the Indian empire spread only to the =
east and not in the west beyond say, Afghanisthan may have to be abandoned.=
 Thirdly the effeminate and pathetic belief that India, unlike any other co=
untry in the world could by some age spread her benign and beatific cultura=
l influence, language, customs, manners and education over distant lands wi=
thout militarily conquering them is baseless. India did conquer all those c=
ountries physically wherever traces of its culture and language are still e=
xtant and the region extended from Bali island in the south Pacific to the =
Baltic in Northern Europe and from Korea to Kaaba. The only difference was =
that while Indian rulers
>  identified themselves with the local population=
 and established welfare states, Moghuls and others who ruled conquered lan=
ds perpetuated untold atrocities over the vanquished. 
> =E2=80=98Sayar-ul-=
Okul=E2=80=99 tells us that a pan-Arabic poetic symposium used to be held i=
n Mecca at the annual Okaj fair in pre-Islamic times. All leading poets use=
d to participate in it. 
> Poems considered best were awarded prizes. The b=
est-engraved on gold plate were hung inside the temple. Others etched on ca=
mel or goatskin were hung outside. Thus for thousands of years the Kaaba wa=
s the treasure house of the best Arabian poetic thought inspired by the Ind=
ian Vedic tradition. 
> That tradition being of immemorial antiquity many p=
oetic compositions were engraved and hung inside and outside on the walls o=
f the Kaaba. But most of the poems got lost and destroyed during the stormi=
ng of the Kaaba by Prophet Mohammad=E2=80=99s troops. The Prophet=E2=80=99s=
 court poet, Hassan-bin-Sawik, who was among the invaders, captured some of=
 the treasured poems and dumped the gold plate on which they were inscribed=
 in his own home. Sawik=E2=80=99s grandson, hoping to earn a reward carried=
 those gold plates to Khalif=E2=80=99s court where he met the well-known Ar=
ab scholar Abu Amir Asamai. The latter received from the bearer five gold p=
lates and 16 leather sheets with the prize-winning poems engraved on them. =
The bearer was sent away happy bestowed with a good reward. 
> On the five =
gold plates were inscribed verses by ancient Arab poets like Labi Baynay, A=
khatab-bin- Turfa and Jarrham Bintoi. That discovery made Harun-al-Rashid o=
rder Abu Amir to compile a collection of all earlier compositions. One of t=
he compositions in the collection is a tribute in verse paid by Jarrham Bin=
toi, a renowned Arab poet, to king Vikramaditya. Bintoi who lived 165 years=
 before Prophet Mohammad had received the highest award for the best poetic=
 compositions for three years in succession in the pan-Arabic symposiums he=
ld in Mecca every year. All those three poems of Bintoi adjudged best were =
hung inside the Kaaba temple, inscribed on gold plates. One of these consti=
tuted an unreserved tribute to King Vikramaditya for his paternal and filia=
l rule over Arabia. That has already been quoted above. 
> Pre-Islamic Arab=
ian poet Bintoi=E2=80=99s tribute to king Vikramaditya is a decisive eviden=
ce that it was king Vikramaditya who first conquered the Arabian Peninsula =
and made it a part of the Indian Empire. This explains why starting from In=
dia towards the west we have all Sanskrit names like Afghanisthan (now Afgh=
anistan) , Baluchisthan, Kurdisthan, Tajikiathan, Uzbekisthan,=C2=A0 Iran, =
Sivisthan, Iraq, Arvasthan, Turkesthan (Turkmenisthan) etc. 
> Historians h=
ave blundered in not giving due weight to the evidence provided by Sanskrit=
 names pervading over the entire west Asian region. Let us take a contempor=
ary instance. Why did a part of India get named Nagaland even after the end=
 of British rule over India? After all historical traces are wiped out of h=
uman memory, will a future age historian be wrong if he concludes from the =
name Nagaland that the British or some English speaking power must have rul=
ed over India? Why is Portuguese spoken in Goa (part of India), and French =
in Pondichery (part of India), and both French and English in Canada? Is it=
 not because those people ruled over the territories where their languages =
are spoken? Can we not then justly conclude that wherever traces of Sanskri=
t names and traditions exist Indians once held sway? It is unfortunate that=
 this important piece of decisive evidence has been ignored all these centu=
ries. 
> Another question which should have presented itself to historians =
for consideration is how could it be that Indian empires could extend in th=
e east as far as Korea and Japan, while not being able to make headway beyo=
nd Afghanisthan? In fact land campaigns are much easier to conduct than by =
sea. It was the Indians who ruled the entire West Asian region from Karachi=
 to Hedjaz and who gave Sanskrit names to those lands and the towns therein=
, introduce their pantheon of the fire-worship, imparted education and esta=
blished law and order. 
> It may be that Arabia itself was not part of the =
Indian empire until king Vikrama , since Bintoi says that it was king Vikra=
ma who for the first time brought about a radical change in the social, cul=
tural and political life of Arabia. It may be that the whole of West Asia e=
xcept Arabia was under Indian rule before Vikrama. The latter added Arabia =
too to the Indian Empire. Or as a remote possibility it could be that king =
Vikramaditya himself conducted a series of brilliant campaigns annexing to =
his empire the vast region between Afghanisthan and Hedjaz. 
> Incidentally=
 this also explains why king Vikramaditya is so famous in history. Apart fr=
om the nobility and truthfulness of heart and his impartial filial affectio=
n for all his subjects, whether Indian or Arab, as testified by Bintoi, kin=
g Vikramaditya has been permanently enshrined in the pages of history becau=
se he was the world=E2=80=99s greatest ruler having the largest empire. It =
should be remembered that only a monarch with a vast empire gets famous in =
world history. Vikram Samvat (calendar still widely in use in India today) =
which he initiated over 2000 years ago may well mark his victory over Arabi=
a, and the so called Kutub Minar (Kutub Tower in Delhi), a pillar commemora=
ting that victory and the consequential marriage with the Vaihika (Balkh) p=
rincess as testified by the nearby iron pillar inscription. 
> A great many=
 puzzles of ancient world history get automatically solved by a proper unde=
rstanding of these great conquests of king Vikramaditya. As recorded by the=
 Arab poet Bintoi, Indian scholars, preachers and social workers spread the=
 fire-worship ceremony, preached the Vedic way of life, manned schools, set=
 up Ayurvedic (healing) centres, trained the local people in irrigation and=
 agriculture and established in those regions a democratic, orderly, peacef=
ul, enlightened and religious way of life. That was of course, a Vedic Hind=
u way of life. 
> It is from such ancient times that Indian Kshtriya royal =
families, like the Pahalvis and Barmaks, have held sway over Iran and Iraq.=
 It is those conquests, which made the Parsees Agnihotris i.e., fire-worshi=
ppers. It is therefore that we find the Kurds of Kurdisthan speaking a Sans=
kritised dialect, fire temples existing thousands of miles away from India,=
 and scores of sites of ancient Indian cultural centres like Navbahar in We=
st Asia and the numerous viharas in Soviet Russia spread throughout the wor=
ld. Ever since so many viharas are often dug up in Soviet Russia, ancient I=
ndian sculptures are also found in excavations in Central Asia. The same go=
es for West Asia. 
> [Note: Ancient Indian sculptures include metal statues=
 of the Hindu deity Ganesh (the elephant headed god); the most recent find =
being in Kuwait]. 
> Unfortunately these chapters of world history have bee=
n almost obliterated from public memory. They need to be carefully decipher=
ed and rewritten. When these chapters are rewritten they might change the e=
ntire concept and orientation of ancient history. 
> In view of the overwhe=
lming evidence led above, historians, scholars, students of history and lay=
 men alike should take note that they had better revise their text books of=
 ancient world history. The existence of Hindu customs, shrines, Sanskrit n=
ames of whole regions, countries and towns and the Vikramaditya inscription=
s reproduced at the beginning are a thumping proof that Indian Kshatriyas o=
nce ruled over the vast region from Bali to Baltic and Korea to Kaaba in Me=
cca, Arabia at the very least.
