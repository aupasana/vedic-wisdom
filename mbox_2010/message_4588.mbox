 Question: Is reincarnation a fact?

Bhagavan: You are incarnated now, aren=
't you? Then you will be so again. But
as the body is illusion then the ill=
usion will repeat itself and keep on
repeating itself until you find the re=
al Self.

Question: What is death and what is birth?

Bhagavan: Only the bo=
dy has death and birth, and it (the body) is illusion.
There is, in Reality=
, neither birth nor death.

Question: How much time may elapse between deat=
h and rebirth?

Bhagavan: Perhaps one is reborn within a year, three years =
or thousands of
years. Who can say? Anyway what is time? Time does not exis=
t.

Question: Why have we no memory of past lives?

Bhagavan: Memory is a f=
aculty of the mind and part of the illusion. Why do
you want to remember ot=
her lives that are also illusions? If you abide
within the Self, there is n=
o past or future and not even a present since the
Self is out of time - tim=
eless.


Question: Are the world, the mind, ego and the body all the same t=
hing?

Bhagavan: Yes. They are one and the same thing. The mind and the ego=
 are one
thing, but there is no word to explain this. You see, the world ca=
nnot exist
without the mind, the mind cannot exist without what we call the=
 ego
(itself, really) and the ego cannot exist without a body.

Question: T=
hen when we leave this body, that is when the ego leaves it, will
it (the e=
go) immediately grasp another body?

Bhagavan: Oh, yes, it must. It cannot =
exist without a body.

Question: What sort of a body will it grasp then?

B=
hagavan: Either a physical body or a subtle-mental body.

Question: Do you =
call this present physical body the gross body?

Bhagavan: Only to distingu=
ish it - to set it apart in conversation. It is
really a subtle-mental body=
 also.

Question: What causes us to be reborn?

Bhagavan: Desires. Your unf=
ulfilled desires bring you back. And in each case
- in each body - as your =
desires are fulfilled, you create new ones. You
must conquer desire to be a=
bsorbed into the One and thus end rebirth.

Question: Can sex change in reb=
irth?

Bhagavan: Oh, surely. We have all been both sexes many times.

Quest=
ion: Is it possible to sin?

Bhagavan: Having a body, which creates illusio=
n, is the only sin, and the
body is our only hell. But it is right that we =
observe moral laws. The
discussion of sin is too difficult for a few lines.=


Question: Does one who has realized the Self lose the sense of 'I'?

Bhag=
avan: Absolutely.

Question: Then to you there is no difference between you=
rself and myself,
that man over there, my servant - are all the same?

Bhag=
avan: All are the same, including those monkeys.

Question: But the monkeys=
 are not people. Are they not different?

Bhagavan: They are exactly the sa=
me as people. All creatures are the same in
One Consciousness.

Question: D=
o we lose our individuality when we merge into the Self?

Bhagavan: There i=
s no individuality in the Self. The Self is One - Supreme.

Question: Then =
individuality and identity are lost?

Bhagavan: You don't retain them in de=
ep sleep, do you?

Question: But we retain them from one birth to another, =
don't we?

Bhagavan: Oh, yes. The 'I' thought (the ego) will recur again, o=
nly each
time you identify with it a different body and different surroundi=
ngs around
the body. The effects of past acts (karma) will continue to cont=
rol the new
body just as they did the old one. It is karma that has given y=
ou this
particular body and placed it in a particular family, race, sex,
su=
rroundings and so forth.

Bhagavan added, "It is better just to meditate an=
d have no thought. Let the
mind rest quietly on the Self in the cave of the=
 Spiritual Heart. Soon this
will become natural and then there will be no n=
eed for questions. Do not
imagine that this means being inactive.Silence is=
 the only real activity."

Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi died on April fourteent=
h, 1950. He had said, "I am
going away? Where could I go? I am here." By th=
e word "here" he did not
imply any limitation. He meant rather, that the Se=
lf 'is'. There is no
going, or coming, or changing in that which is changel=
ess and Universal. I
should not have regarded his death as a blow. How coul=
d I lose him? How can
one lose anyone? How can one lose that which is Etern=
al? It is only in the
first shock, and gripped in the illusion of death, th=
at one grieves for the
physical presence.

Yet, millions in India mourned t=
he Maharshi. A long article about his death
in the New York Times ended wit=
h, "Here in India, where thousands of
so-called holy men claim close tune w=
ith the infinite, it is said that the
most remarkable thing about Ramana Ma=
harshi was that he never claimed
anything remarkable for himself, yet becam=
e one of the most loved and
respected of all." - [Concluded - Mercedes de A=
costa died in New York City
in 1966.]
