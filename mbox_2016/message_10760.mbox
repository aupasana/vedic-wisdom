> Regarding Durga shapshati It takes me only 25 minutes

Many peo=
ple that are comfortable with the text take 60 minutes or so to
recite it (=
without angas). Though it can be done a little faster, a 25
minute parayana=
 is practically impossible for most of us.

> a lot of Sanskara need to be =
done before the main Parayan begins

Though it is always nice to do things =
elaborately, especially on special
occasions, it is not necessary. You can =
stick with just the main parayana,
especially if you are doing it as a regu=
lar sadhana.

> Is is OK to read just one chapter or portions of the Saptas=
hati

Yes.

> Which ones and how does one do it

The durga-saptashloki has =
only 7 slokas from the saptashati. You can repeat
that. Or, you can read ju=
st the first charitra. Or, you can read the first
chapter, or the chapter w=
ith narayani stuti (namastasyai).

Alternatively, read the whole text over =
a few days. Read at least one
chapter per sitting, and if possible, end eac=
h sitting with a chapter that
has a positive energy to it (i.e. devi defeat=
s the asuras).

sasneham,

    ajit
