The meaning of offering ones action lies in the fact that we do not have
co=
ntrol over the result of our actions, What ever action we may do would
resu=
lt into four different results viz.1. Get what was expected. 2. Get
more th=
an expected.3. Get less than expected.4. Get something totally
something di=
fferent.
We can and must do all our actions wit the best of our ability ' k=
oshalam'
and leave the results of the action to the Lord who is the giver o=
f the
fruits of our action and take the results as 'PRASAD' from the almigh=
ty.
Once we accept this fact and do all our Karma to the best of our abilit=
y
and take the results as prasad,
slowly our mind will become 'nirmal' and =
we will be ready for Gyana.
