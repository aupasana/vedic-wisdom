There was a nice video of Swami Nityananda in YouTube explaining on how to =
control sexual desires. Unfortunately I don't see that video anymore. H=
e mentioned a trick. He said that one should strictly not think of anything=
 related to sex.  Absolutely nothing. And to practice this method for 15 da=
ys. All sexual desires go away. I tried dnd it worked really well.
But my u=
nderstanding is getting sexual urges is all God's leela. Whenever I rea=
d Durga Saptashati I get strong sexual urge. When I control it I am rewarde=
d when I don't I am punished. Vaasanas are constantly tested. And they =
become more harder as I progress. Lately I am getting this urge with every =
homams. I fail to understand why. No matter how much celibacy one practices=
 at some point one definitely loses when it comes to God's leela. 
Bott=
om line not to think much about it. If he wants he will take you to the pat=
h of brahmachari without any obstruction. So keep praying control it whenev=
er you can. Don't suppress it if you can't as suppression causes lo=
t of stress. 
I would love to hear from Narasimha ji about this. 

My two c=
ents. 
Thanks.
