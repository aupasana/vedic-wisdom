 =
=C2=A0   Whatever is considered positive, things that are deemed undesirabl=
e; are all forms of energy.

The first logical step in the pursuit of unkno=
wn through mantra sadhana is a purashcharan. It is a system of practices an=
d rituals intended to raise one's energy to the level where it becomes spon=
taneous and inexhaustible. A limitless source of energy is necessary to acc=
ess the higher states of consciousness.

The way I was performing it, the p=
urashcharan was similar to my normal routine. The overall experience, howev=
er, was radically different.

An undisciplined mind is a factory of chaos c=
hurning out thoughts embedded into thoughts that morph into other thoughts,=
 which in turn, incite plenty more thoughts. These processes consume precio=
us energy and create psychological blocks that hinder one's spiritual growt=
h. This hindrance reflects on the material world creating a chain reaction =
of emotional, physical and social turmoil.

Meditation makes the body still=
, curtails the wayward flow of energies and trains the senses to work in ta=
ndem. When a mantra is infused in this process, it controls the wandering m=
ind, abates the thoughts and synchronizes the rising energies in a single s=
tream.

During my purashcharan, each day brought me a new challenge. Hours =
of meditation resulted in excruciating pain that withered me. I suffered bu=
t I held my ground and kept going. After weeks of ignoring the pain, I lear=
ned to gain strength from whatever caused the pain by converting it into en=
ergy.

Each moment culminated into an ever uglier thought. Vivid and vile, =
they introduced me to the darkest part of my psyche - a part I never though=
t I had. I was shaken to the core. My efforts to restrain them were repelle=
d viciously making my mind fertile for even deadlier venoms. Since everythi=
ng else ended up fueling them, I accepted those thoughts just as I accept t=
he better ones. 

Whenever my energy plunged down, I felt like I was being =
buried alive into the depths of hell. When it surged upwards, the ordeal wa=
s similar to a dive into the Sun's corona. My mind devised plots against me=
, each more sinister than the other, and my body executed them with an unpr=
ecedented zeal making my desire to give up stronger than ever. I faced them=
 all with a little more determination and a lot more enthusiasm.

The Aghor=
is believe that everything is created by Lord Shiva and hence, belongs to L=
ord Shiva. Whatever belongs to Lord Shiva is Lord Shiva and is, therefore, =
pure and venerable. This philosophy made my path unobstructed and increased=
 my energy by many folds.

After several traumatic waves of uncertainty, my=
 energy finally began its ascent.

A brisk, somewhat frigid, eerily familia=
r yet unrecognizable sensation entered my skin and slowly moved towards my =
heart numbing everything in its path. In a tremulous motion, I was floating=
 in partial weightlessness. I was able to immerse in that disorienting muta=
tion the moment I stopped tugging to my stability. The universe within and =
the apparent universe without were both being transformed. All I could hear=
 was a maddening buzz; still, I was hearing way better than I normally woul=
d. Blurred and distorted, my vision began fading away. Things were drifting=
 further, disappearing into darkness. Yet somehow, I felt I was seeing the =
way I never saw before.

Formless and yet, very much aware of my form, I wa=
s roaming the boundless expanse. Still connected to the elements of mortali=
ty, I was experiencing every aspect of my existence - from infinitesimal to=
 infinite. Thoughts and actions evolved into an autonomous, sentient proces=
s. My senses unified to access all the new dimensions. Time slowed down and=
 places converged to a single point. Boundaries dissipated, limits scrunche=
d and my energy level merged with the threshold. At that very moment, as th=
e form was about to disappear into the formless, the energy accumulated at =
the base of my spine spiked and, violently traversing my spine, irradiated =
my crown chakra.

I was in a void or I was that vast emptiness. Featureless=
, formless, timeless - it was beyond existence and even beyond non-existenc=
e. It had no origin and no end. It was, perhaps, a precursor of salvation o=
r maybe, the grandest form of the goddess. I still wonder, have I already a=
chieved my ultimate goal.

Joy - sorrow, love - hatred, positive - negative=
; in that moment, they all seemed indifferent. If I were to spend the etern=
ity somewhere, I'd probably choose that realm of nothingness. As they say, =
even the perpetual night sees the light of the dawn. In that endless darkne=
ss, I noticed a tiny speck of light. Shining far, far away, approaching at =
an incredible speed; it was a beacon, a reminder that wasn't a random occur=
rence. I had put it there just before entering the trance. That insignifica=
nt dot, by then brighter than the Sun, was going to guide me back to the ma=
terial world.

Emotions were the first to return. They were stable, laced w=
ith a sense of purpose. My hearing had a new dimension. I also realized tha=
t my vision was not limited to my physical eyes. All my senses were streaml=
ined, working harmoniously. It felt like each cell of my body had its own p=
ower source. When the torrential stream of thoughts was about to flood my m=
ind, something, at the base of my spine, erupted a massive amount of energy=
.

My root chakra was throbbing violently, sending shockwaves of energy eve=
rywhere in my body. Instead of shooting upwards and vanishing at my crown c=
hakra in a flash, the energy kept building up there.

A while later, it gus=
ted to the sacral chakra initiating a downpour of every possible negativity=
. Enjoying the rhythmic pulsation of both the chakras, I struggled with its=
 outcome. Gradually, the energy brought order to its own chaotic self and c=
ontinued expanding.

When it spiraled to the solar plexus, I experienced th=
e turiya state - the gateway to a plethora of states of consciousness. At t=
he heart chakra, I immersed into eternal joy. Absolute purity and clarity d=
renched me at the throat chakra.

When the energy ascended towards my 3rd e=
ye, it had already attained a divine form. I witnessed my whole life - past=
, present and probable future - in what seemed like a fraction of a second.=
 Several other things were also whisked through my mind, but they were beyo=
nd my comprehension.

Then suddenly, the resonance of the chakras, locked i=
n a harmonious synchrony, increased drastically. Bereft of their characteri=
stics, they emptied their entire energy in the crown chakra in a precise ou=
tburst. For a split second, I felt as if all the electricity of the univers=
e has been dumped into my head. Everything dissolved into a blinding flash.=


Hours later, when I regained control over my senses, I discovered that a =
misty warmth, after traversing my spine and energizing each of my chakras, =
was flowing into my brain creating a very pleasant sensation. My Kundalini,=
 the physical aspect of the goddess,=C2=A0 also referred to as the Serpent,=
 had awakened.

d undesirable; are all forms of energy.</span><br clear=3D"none"><br clear=
=3D"none">The first logical step in the pursuit of unknown through mantra s=
adhana is a purashcharan. It is a system of practices and rituals intended =
to raise one's energy to the level where it becomes spontaneous and inexhau=
stible. A limitless source of energy is necessary to access the higher stat=
es of consciousness.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">The way I was per=
forming it, the purashcharan was similar to my normal routine. The overall =
experience, however, was radically different.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=
=3D"none">An undisciplined mind is a factory of chaos churning out thoughts=
 embedded into thoughts that morph into other thoughts, which in turn, inci=
te plenty more thoughts. These processes consume precious energy and create=
 psychological blocks that hinder one's spiritual growth. This hindrance re=
flects on the material world creating a chain reaction of emotional, physic=
al and social turmoil.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">Meditation make=
s the body still, curtails the wayward flow of energies and trains the sens=
es to work in tandem. When a mantra is infused in this process, it controls=
 the wandering mind, abates the thoughts and synchronizes the rising energi=
es in a single stream.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">During my puras=
hcharan, each day brought me a new challenge. Hours of meditation resulted =
in excruciating pain that withered me. I suffered but I held my ground and =
kept going. After weeks of ignoring the pain, I learned to gain strength fr=
om whatever caused the pain by converting it into energy.<br clear=3D"none"=
><br clear=3D"none">Each moment culminated into an ever uglier thought. Viv=
id and vile, they introduced me to the darkest part of my psyche - a part I=
 never thought I had. I was shaken to the core. My efforts to restrain them=
 were repelled viciously making my mind fertile for even deadlier venoms. S=
ince everything else ended up fueling them, I accepted those thoughts just =
as I accept the better ones. <br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">Whenever=
 my energy plunged down, I felt like I was being buried alive into the dept=
hs of hell. When it surged upwards, the ordeal was similar to a dive into t=
he Sun's corona. My mind devised plots against me, each more sinister than =
the other, and my body executed them with an unprecedented zeal making my d=
esire to give up stronger than ever. I faced them all with a little more de=
termination and a lot more enthusiasm.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none"=
>The Aghoris believe that everything is created by Lord Shiva and hence, be=
longs to Lord Shiva. Whatever belongs to Lord Shiva is Lord Shiva and is, t=
herefore, pure and venerable. This philosophy made my path unobstructed and=
 increased my energy by many folds.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">Af=
ter several traumatic waves of uncertainty, my energy finally began its asc=
ent.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">A brisk, somewhat frigid, eerily =
familiar yet unrecognizable sensation entered my skin and slowly moved towa=
rds my heart numbing everything in its path. In a tremulous motion, I was f=
loating in partial weightlessness. I was able to immerse in that disorienti=
ng mutation the moment I stopped tugging to my stability. The universe with=
in and the apparent universe without were both being transformed. All I cou=
ld hear was a maddening buzz; still, I was hearing way better than I normal=
ly would. Blurred and distorted, my vision began fading away. Things were d=
rifting further, disappearing into darkness. Yet somehow, I felt I was seei=
ng the way I never saw before.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">Formles=
s and yet, very much aware of my form, I was roaming the boundless expanse.=
 Still connected to the elements of mortality, I was experiencing every asp=
ect of my existence - from infinitesimal to infinite. Thoughts and actions =
evolved into an autonomous, sentient process. My senses unified to access a=
ll the new dimensions. Time slowed down and places converged to a single po=
int. Boundaries dissipated, limits scrunched and my energy level merged wit=
h the threshold. At that very moment, as the form was about to disappear in=
to the formless, the energy accumulated at the base of my spine spiked and,=
 violently traversing my spine, irradiated my crown chakra.<br clear=3D"non=
e"><br clear=3D"none">I was in a void or I was that vast emptiness. Feature=
less, formless, timeless - it was beyond existence and even beyond non-exis=
tence. It had no origin and no end. It was, perhaps, a precursor of salvati=
on or maybe, the grandest form of the goddess. I still wonder, have I alrea=
dy achieved my ultimate goal.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">Joy - so=
rrow, love - hatred, positive - negative; in that moment, they all seemed i=
ndifferent. If I were to spend the eternity somewhere, I'd probably choose =
that realm of nothingness. As they say, even the perpetual night sees the l=
ight of the dawn. In that endless darkness, I noticed a tiny speck of light=
. Shining far, far away, approaching at an incredible speed; it was a beaco=
n, a reminder that wasn't a random occurrence. I had put it there just befo=
re entering the trance. That insignificant dot, by then brighter than the S=
un, was going to guide me back to the material world.<br clear=3D"none"><br=
 clear=3D"none">Emotions were the first to return. They were stable, laced =
with a sense of purpose. My hearing had a new dimension. I also realized th=
at my vision was not limited to my physical eyes. All my senses were stream=
lined, working harmoniously. It felt like each cell of my body had its own =
power source. When the torrential stream of thoughts was about to flood my =
mind, something, at the base of my spine, erupted a massive amount of energ=
y.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">My root chakra was throbbing violen=
tly, sending shockwaves of energy everywhere in my body. Instead of shootin=
g upwards and vanishing at my crown chakra in a flash, the energy kept buil=
ding up there.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">A while later, it guste=
d to the sacral chakra initiating a downpour of every possible negativity. =
Enjoying the rhythmic pulsation of both the chakras, I struggled with its o=
utcome. Gradually, the energy brought order to its own chaotic self and con=
tinued expanding.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">When it spiraled to =
the solar plexus, I experienced the turiya state - the gateway to a plethor=
a of states of consciousness. At the heart chakra, I immersed into eternal =
joy. Absolute purity and clarity drenched me at the throat chakra.<br clear=
=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">When the energy ascended towards my 3rd eye, i=
t had already attained a divine form. I witnessed my whole life - past, pre=
sent and probable future - in what seemed like a fraction of a second. Seve=
ral other things were also whisked through my mind, but they were beyond my=
 comprehension.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">Then suddenly, the res=
onance of the chakras, locked in a harmonious synchrony, increased drastica=
lly. Bereft of their characteristics, they emptied their entire energy in t=
he crown chakra in a precise outburst. For a split second, I felt as if all=
 the electricity of the universe has been dumped into my head. Everything d=
issolved into a blinding flash.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">Hours =
later, when I regained control over my senses, I discovered that a misty wa=
rmth, after traversing my spine and energizing each of my chakras, was flow=
ing into my brain creating a very pleasant sensation. My Kundalini, the phy=
sical aspect of the goddess,  also referred to as the Serpent, had awa=
kened.</div><div><span><br class=3D"yiv3172953731yui-cursor" clear=3D"none"=
