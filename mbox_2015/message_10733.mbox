Namaste,

Couple of years back when I was doing Gayatri japa I felt vibrati=
on and electric shock for whole day.

I was afraid of that so I left it. Pl=
ease guide me what to do if some sadhak knows.

=C2=A0 

Namaste,

=

I was seeing this thread. Two small comments, feel free to ignore them if =
they don't make sense.


Firstly it is indeed true that for many traditiona=
l practices a Guru is needed, however it is neither sanguine nor fail-proof=
, by which I mean there are often cases where even Guru may not be able to =
save a disciple from a certain kind of experience. One of the main reasons =
being in this point of Kali Yuga realistically speaking getting a Guru who =
has the Shakti and the Divine connect to pull a disciple off or cushion the=
 disciple from all experiences or prepare the disciple properly and make ex=
periences digestible is quite rare to find. Gurus are many, but Gurus who c=
an really control these stuff and give the right kind of Shakti are very ve=
ry rare, and it does not matter whether they are in some sampradaya or outs=
ide of all sampradaya.=C2=A0


In such an environment doing ones own sadhan=
a without waiting for a formal Guru is not a bad idea. Regarding homas ther=
e are two kinds of homas. One where it is a process to connect to God using=
 Agni Tattwa. When one prays in a temple to an idol one is trying to use Pr=
ithiwi Tattwa. Otherwise, in principle, both are similar. Of course practic=
al differences exist and that is due to the difference in the nature of the=
 two great elements.=C2=A0


Then there is the homa done for Kriya-s or spe=
cific results. That is complex and may require guidance. But I think PVR me=
ntions in his manuals that he does not encourage such homas or one should i=
deally use these only for the purpose of worshiping deities.



I started m=
y first homa in 2007 when I did not know PVR or even this website. Infact I=
 come from an environment when is not particularly religious or ritualistic=
 and I had frankly never even seen a homa. But the year before that I had a=
 strange and chance encounter with a spiritual man - who refuses to be addr=
essed as a Guru - and he inspired me to try out spiritualiy. I became curio=
us and started sadhana with mantra japa. Then one day I felt a strong desir=
e to do homas. I asked some people around me and all of them unanimously to=
ld me not to do so. I still did anyway. =C2=A0Since then it has been nearly=
 9 years I have been doing homas to different deities. Of course in between=
 now and then I have come across more advaced yogis who have kidly helped m=
e or directed me or told me a step here and step there, rest I just kept wa=
lking. This led to some experiences too over the years. But none of these y=
ogis were really traditional Gurus, nor did anyone ever give
 me formal dik=
sha.


One of the main sadhanas which I was fortunate enough to do was Chan=
di homas. I remember one day I came across a very traditional individual wh=
o was shocked when I told him that I do this sadhana. He insisted that it c=
annot be done like this and it needs a guru and a diksha otherwise strong n=
egative consequences are bound to come due to the wrath of the Mother. Now =
I tend to get bit aggressive when I find condescending people. So I told hi=
m that I have done more than 500 Chandi homas (after which I have stopped c=
ounting) and not only done them inside my home but in ancient and powerful =
Shakti peethas, in deserted locales, in off beat places, but places fit for=
 Shakti sadhana, where many ordinary people would not venture easily. Now i=
f he really believed what he said, that would mean that the Mother must hav=
e allowed me to do these, for I did not face any wrath but only more opport=
unities to intensify the sadhana. So I am assuming the big boss is OK with
=
 me doing things in a non-traditional fashion. He had nothing more to say.=
=C2=A0


I am not saying or suggesting that tradition is wrong, it is there=
 for a purpose but getting the spirit of the rules in Tradition is far more=
 important than blind following of the same. Traditions exist for the Deity=
, not the other way round. And given the point in time where we are, I am a=
fraid there will be more and more souls who will worship and eventually int=
eract with Deities outside of formal traditions. For a soul who has done sa=
dhana and wants to do so, will always do so, Nature and the Deity will make=
 it happen, irrespective of whether s/he lines up with a tradition or not, =
whether s/he is born in India or South Pole. This is the new reality.


On =
the other hand if the mind has doubts about consequences of going in a non-=
traditional manner, then one is better off not doing so. Because doubts mak=
e the sadhana go wrong, and the mind itself will cause more obstructions th=
at anyone or anything else. Mind can be our best friend in the path, or our=
 worst enemy.

Coming to the dream th=
at you saw, I would say it was a very significant dream. =C2=A0Snakes in dr=
eams can have various meanings. Not all are good. But this one seems to me =
like a indication of a very specific kind of spiritual expeirence to come, =
or would have come to you, had you not made any change =C2=A0in your routin=
e sadhana.=C2=A0


Spirituality has two parts. We start off with a desire t=
o experience God, we do whatever we think can help us in that, which can le=
ad to experiences which tell us we maybe come a bit closer. Then comes dige=
sting them. To do so one has to have a stable mental and emotional conditio=
n.


>From what you described my sanguine feeling is that a strong experienc=
e was coming your way, but doubt and fear stopped it and made it recede bac=
k. Now spiritual experiences are not like daily states of consciousness. If=
 they were, they would be no good. They are different. And that came make u=
s feel unnerved at times.


Did this happen due to homa? I think it was des=
tined for you at some point. It could as well have happened one early morni=
ng as you were having a cup of tea without lifting a finger. What sadhana d=
oes - by which I mean homa, japa, yoga whatever - is change the patterns of=
 karma and accelerate the experiences that would have come to you anyway. B=
ut more than that it helps your mind-body to stabilize which is vital to be=
 able to integrate and digest an experience when it comes.=C2=A0


So witho=
ut thinking about it I would suggest that you keep doing sadhana, whatever =
it maybe. As you do more, you nervous system will grow stronger, your emoti=
onal, and mental sheath with become calmer and stabler and maybe the next t=
ime the Snake comes you won't feel unnerved! -:)


Wish you all the best.

=C2=A0Even I was cu=

to get bit aggressive when I find condescending people. So I told him that =
I have done more than 500 Chandi homas (after which I have stopped counting=
) and not only done them inside my home but in ancient and powerful Shakti =
peethas, in deserted locales, in off beat places, but places fit for Shakti=
 sadhana, where many ordinary people would not venture easily. Now if he re=
ally believed what he said, that would mean that the Mother must have allow=
ed me to do these, for I did not face any wrath but only
 more opportunitie=
s to intensify the sadhana. So I am assuming the big boss is OK with me doi=
ng things in a non-traditional fashion. He had nothing more to say. </=
