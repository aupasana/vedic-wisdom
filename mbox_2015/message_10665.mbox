Namaste Tanvir,

>>*As an example if I chant =E2=80=9COm Namo Bhagavate Rud=
raya=E2=80=9D on mala VS I recite
the 108 names of Lord Shiva for the same =
amount of time, which one is going
to more effective?*
Japa mala is just a =
yantra, but it is good as it helps you not getting
lost. This is my underst=
anding, but i'm sure there is more to it. 108 times
is to cleanse 108 major=
 nadis within our body which is a perfect Yantra.
You might loose the japa =
mala but not loose the body until your soul leaves
it!

*>>Another example =
=E2=80=93 if I chant a simple short Durga mantra, which takes
around 15 min=
utes to complete one mala... VS if I chant 108 Names of Durga
=E2=80=93 whi=
ch is more effective?*
I'm not aware which is better

>>* 2 hrs of japa put=
s a huge strain on my voice*
Japa/mantra is effective when recited mentally=
 and not loudly. Below are
the 3 types of chanting a mantra and its effecti=
veness.
1. Loudly (others can listen)
   This is least effective. But for s=
tarters it might be good to get the
hang of the mantra. But not at all reco=
mmended. If it is a taraka mantra,
better not say it loudly.
2. Very slowly=
 (where only you hear with your ears)
   There is a still movement of your =
tongue. This is better than chanting
loudly but still not the best.
3. Ment=
ally (no movement or sound produced which is audible externally)
   You sho=
uld be able to hear the mantra within yourself and none outside.
This is th=
e best/ effective way to recite a mantra which yields maximum
output and al=
so recommended by Rishis and saints.

If the mantra which you are reciting =
is taraka mantra, then it should be
done 24/7 and not restrict it to just 2=
 hours. 2 hours can be focused
meditation reciting mantra. Well.. I'm not s=
aying all these but are the
words of Saints.

On top of mantra you can reci=
te Stotram as well.

Hari Om
