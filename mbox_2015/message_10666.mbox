: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Mantra Japa or Stotram?




Namaste Tanvir,

>>As an e=
xample if I chant =E2=80=9COm Namo Bhagavate Rudraya=E2=80=9D on mala VS I =
recite the 108 names of Lord Shiva for the same amount of time, which one i=
s going to more effective?
Japa mala is just a yantra, but it is good as it=
 helps you not getting lost. This is my understanding, but i'm sure there i=
s more to it. 108 times is to cleanse 108 major nadis within our body which=
 is a perfect Yantra. You might loose the japa mala but not loose the body =
until your soul leaves it!



>>Another example =E2=80=93 if I chant a simp=
le short Durga mantra, which takes around 15 minutes to complete one mala..=
. VS if I chant 108 Names of Durga =E2=80=93 which is more effective?

I'm =
not aware which is better


>> 2 hrs of japa puts a huge strain on my voice=

Japa/mantra is effective when recited mentally and not loudly. Below are t=
he 3 types of chanting a mantra and its effectiveness. 
1. Loudly (others c=
an listen)
   This is least effective. But for starters it might be good to=
 get the hang of the mantra. But not at all recommended. If it is a taraka =
mantra, better not say it loudly. 
2. Very slowly (where only you hear with=
 your ears)
   There is a still movement of your tongue. This is better tha=
n chanting loudly but still not the best.
3. Mentally (no movement or sound=
 produced which is audible externally)
   You should be able to hear the ma=
ntra within yourself and none outside. This is the best/ effective way to r=
ecite a mantra which yields maximum output and also recommended by Rishis a=
nd saints. 

If the mantra which you are reciting is taraka mantra, then it=
 should be done 24/7 and not restrict it to just 2 hours. 2 hours can be fo=
cused meditation reciting mantra. Well.. I'm not saying all these but are t=
he words of Saints. 

On top of mantra you can recite Stotram as well. 

Ha=
ri Om
