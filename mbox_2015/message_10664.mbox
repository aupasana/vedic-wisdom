Namaste everyone.

What you think to be more effective, Japa of a mantra (o=
n tulsi / rudraksha mala) or reciting stotram?

As an example if I chant =
=E2=80=9COm Namo Bhagavate Rudraya=E2=80=9D on mala VS I recite the 108 nam=
es of Lord Shiva for the same amount of time, which one is going to more ef=
fective?

Another example =E2=80=93 if I chant a simple short Durga mantra,=
 which takes around 15 minutes to complete one mala... VS if I chant 108 Na=
mes of Durga =E2=80=93 which is more effective?

I am in a strange problem =
actually. Since I am in the japa for 12 years =E2=80=93 I see their power a=
lways. But For last one year or so, I also recite stotram, and I THINK THEY=
 ARE MORE POWERFUL. However, since I saw power of japa for MANY YEARS, psyc=
hologically I cannot leave them out. 

So the situation is like, I want to =
do 2 hours of japa, then another 2 hours of recitation of stotram (path). W=
hich is almost impossible for me. 2 hrs of japa puts a huge strain on my vo=
ice =E2=80=93 my throat actually somewhat burns for continuous chanting for=
 1-2 hours. And generally I get a headache also. I become extremely tired t=
o keep my body still for 2 hours and chant =E2=80=93 though a little rest a=
fter chanting gets me alright again. Anyway, so what I should do, is to lea=
ve out japa and only do the path (recitation) =E2=80=93 but psychologically=
 I don=E2=80=99t feel like to miss out the chanting, I do not want to miss =
their power. But, it is actually being quite impossible for me.

What is yo=
ur opinion? Do you also agree to me that recitation of a stotram is more po=
werful than chanting a mantra?

Thanks
Tanvir
