k TNG

Who am I?

Am I a body which is believed to have a soul?

I came int=
o existence the moment this body was conceived. It verifies my being, valid=
ates my life. It has a brain that makes sense of the gibberish that is thro=
wn at it, finds a purpose and leads me the way I am supposed to be led. My =
body also has a heart. It feels, it loves and makes me desire everything mo=
re and more. An organ called soul is yet to be found.

Then, there is the p=
oint when my body exists but my brain and heart stop functioning. I sometim=
es wonder if I am a body, how can I experience things that are way beyond i=
ts extremities. If I am a body, I shouldn't be dead before my body is incin=
erated on the funeral pyre.

Perhaps, I am a soul which sometimes chooses t=
o have a body.

I am here to learn, experience and discover. What I know pr=
evails even when my body does not. I'll also teach, share and inspire; some=
times without my body's intervention. I know, this body is an illusion alth=
ough sometimes I prefer not to remember this fact so that I can allow mysel=
f to indulge without worrying about the consequences and witness whatever t=
ranspires.

Once I have experienced all there is to experience, learned wha=
tever I need to learn, the illusion will help me break free from the life -=
 death cycle and I'll return to my rightful place. But, if I am not careful=
, it will turn the cycle into a perpetual trap. I can be addicted to variou=
s bonds. The blinding emotions will never let me remember the fact which I =
had chosen to forget temporarily. Misguided by attachments, I'll be lost in=
 a flurry of conflicting anomalies. If, as fate would have it, that happens=
, I'll be drawn here at the temple of the dark, ultimate truth.

This eeril=
y calm place is called the Shmashan, the cremation ground - a gateway to bo=
th the heaven of moksh and the hell of rebirth. This place is where empty s=
hells turn to ash, the worthless is disposed of and myths are dispelled. It=
 is so attuned to banishing the illusionary light that its mere mention mad=
dens the ignorant and drives them away.

Detachment must come naturally - u=
nabashed and free from all comforting lures. There can't be even a trace of=
 any worldly affair.=C2=A0 I must learn to separate the essence from the se=
mblance. Once I have mastered the ensemble and the parts, I'll be free. My =
existence will be devoid of sadness. I'll savor the pleasure in every possi=
ble way. Then, I'll get caught again. Only then, I'll be able to understand=
 that like my captivity, my freedom is also an illusion.

The more I look a=
t the funeral pyre, the more it intrigues me. First, the blistering heat bo=
ils the flesh away from the bones; then, it chars them differently into a s=
ingle substance, ash. So many bodies, so different from each other and yet,=
 they all end up the same, indistinguishable from each other.

Dancing on a=
 whim, flowing transcendentally, spreading warmth without bias, the fire th=
at burns the funeral pyre needs sustenance, produces smoke and leaves resid=
ue. It may brighten my surroundings, but it can't enlighten me.

The fire t=
hat can enlighten me does not brighten anything at all. It is darker than t=
he darkest corner of my psyche. It is omnipresent, relies on nothing and an=
nihilates everything. The ignorant project it as a symbol of negativity the=
 world over. The wise embrace it as the blessing of goddess Kali.

Goddess =
Kali is the presiding deity of the Shmashan. She is the beginning, she is t=
he end. A primal force that enchants everything, she destroys worldly bonda=
ges while blessing with divine pleasures. She is the stark representation o=
f the ultimate truth, she is the illusion. She is the one who dominates thi=
s universe. Damned or blessed, she listens to all.

I don't need to call he=
r. I don't need complex procedures, long rituals or tongue twisting mantras=
 to blend with her. All I need is Kalika Ashtak.

Kalika Ashtak is an eight=
 versed hymn created by Adi Shankaracharya. It encompasses the energy that =
existed before the inception of time. It vibrates with the darkness that wi=
ll prevail after everything else has perished. Everyone who should know it,=
 knows it; many experience divine joy reciting it; and some transcend the v=
isible universe meditating on it. It can negate every negativity.

I have m=
y share of negativity. It is way too potent for conventional means. It has =
a much larger sphere of influence. It affects everything associated with me=
; but, to my utter dismay, it hurts me the most.

Kalika Ashtak protects me=
 from my own negativity. It engulfs my negativity with the darkness emanati=
ng from goddess Kali, transforms it into energy and channels it towards my =
Kundalini enabling me to achieve any goal.

Tonight, it will enliven the Sh=
mashan for me.
