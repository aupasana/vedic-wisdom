Very touching....
Is it a real incident or just a fictional story?
In any c=
ase, very touching...

 =C2=A0   Foreknowledge is power. - Auguste Comte

Mantra sadhana (mantra =
meditation along with several supporting rituals) enables a mind to explore=
 other states of consciousness. While in one of these states, a person can =
experience some sort of psychic abilities. Some people get so overwhelmed b=
y the clutter of confusing, contradictory emotions that they lose the aware=
ness of these abilities while most others succumb to a worldly negativity a=
nd start denying any such possibility. Only a rare few, who possess the nec=
essary clarity, can completely understand their achievements and even they =
can be susceptible to the ways of the rogue.

The lure of being able to do =
things not many can do, though misdirected at times, can be a potent motiva=
tor. I used to meditate on a mantra of goddess Durga for hours, pushing my =
limits, drawing new lines, discovering something new each day. The more I p=
racticed, the deeper I could dive. In the process, I dodged many venomous c=
reatures, attracted many more and it wasn't long before I could get to the =
larger pearls.

One morning, while meditating, I had a vision. I saw garble=
d phrases in a strange language. Later, I wrote down whatever I could recal=
l. This continued for many days. It looked like the source code for a compu=
ter program in a language I did not know. With some effort, I was able to r=
ecognize and learn that programming language. I continued working on it, tw=
eaked the program a bit and, some time later, made good money off of it.

M=
any such incidents later, I once saw myself riding my motorbike on a famili=
ar road. Near a turn, I saw a girl coming from the opposite direction. I wa=
s awestruck by her beauty. I even started wondering about the possibility o=
f finding a common friend or something and meeting her so that things could=
 move in the romantically right direction.

That very moment, a truck came =
out of nowhere and crushed me to death.

The vision was so shockingly reali=
stic, it took me a while to realize that I hadn't actually died. I couldn't=
 shake off the aftereffects of the experience. The surreal pain, the idea o=
f an abrupt ending of my unaccomplished life and the worry about my parents=
 overwhelmed me to the core. I knew, there was no way to prevent it; still,=
 I vowed never to go down that road again.

The vision continued repeating =
itself with a little more detail each day. In a matter of day, I knew the t=
ime of the incident; the make, color and number of the truck; details about=
 the girl's clothes and makeup; and virtually everything around. One day, t=
he vision stopped just as suddenly as it had started.

Time passed by, life=
 took over the thoughts of death and I almost forgot that vision.

I've alw=
ays believed that whatever happens, happens for a reason. Something as comm=
on as fatigue, too, has to have a purpose. That was a day like any other wi=
th a slight difference. I was tired, a little less involved than usual in t=
he physical world, roaming the streets on my own accord, I didn't realize t=
hat I had taken a wrong turn towards the forbidden road. I didn't need to h=
ave a d=C3=A9j=C3=A0 vu to understand the happenings around me.

"So, this =
is it", I thought. In a way, I had accepted it and since I had had plenty o=
f time to prepare, I was sure of the best possible outcome. Nobody can chea=
t death so it was pointless to even try. Things hurriedly moved forward the=
 way they were supposed to and there she was exactly as I had seen her in m=
y vision.

Beauty is to be admired. Amazing beauty, like hers, can make the=
 time slow down. And it did. In the distance, I could hear the roar of a po=
werful engine - cracking, uneven sound - approaching me at a thundering spe=
ed. I could feel my skin collide with the air displaced by a voluminous obj=
ect. My heart was pounding with all its might, as if it was trying to beat =
as many times as it would have, had it not been its time to prematurely sto=
p.

Beauty is to die for. I took a deep breath, probably my last, and gazed=
 upon her face one last time. One must think about something very beautiful=
 in their last moments. There was something more beautiful than the girl wh=
ich I had ignored all along.

Sometimes, it is good not to think. Sometimes=
, it is better not to worry about consequences. Sometimes, it is best not t=
o follow rules. Sometimes, it is awesome to be riding on a single lane road=
.

I swerved my motorbike at an insane angle, narrowly missed a few motorbi=
kes coming from the opposite direction and barely avoided hitting a tree on=
 the other side of the road. The truck also took a wild turn and passed rig=
ht through the spot where I would've been had I not taken that drastic step=
.

I looked around but couldn't find the girl anywhere. Either she was a fi=
gment of my imagination or the goddess had taken that form to save the most=
 beautiful thing there - my life.

 power. - Auguste Comte</span><br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">Mantra =
sadhana (mantra meditation along with several supporting rituals) enables a=
 mind to explore other states of consciousness. While in one of these state=
s, a person can experience some sort of psychic abilities. Some people get =
so overwhelmed by the clutter of confusing, contradictory emotions that the=
y lose the awareness of these abilities while most others succumb to a worl=
dly negativity and start denying any such possibility. Only a rare few, who=
 possess the necessary clarity, can completely understand their achievement=
s and even they can be susceptible to the ways of the rogue.<br clear=3D"no=
ne"><br clear=3D"none">The lure of being able to do things not many can do,=
 though misdirected at times, can be a potent motivator. I used to meditate=
 on a mantra of goddess Durga for hours, pushing my limits, drawing new lin=
es, discovering something new each day. The more I practiced, the deeper I =
could dive. In the process, I dodged many venomous creatures, attracted man=
y more and it wasn't long before I could get to the larger pearls.<br clear=
=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">One morning, while meditating, I had a vision.=
 I saw garbled phrases in a strange language. Later, I wrote down whatever =
I could recall. This continued for many days. It looked like the source cod=
e for a computer program in a language I did not know. With some effort, I =
was able to recognize and learn that programming language. I continued work=
ing on it, tweaked the program a bit and, some time later, made good money =
off of it.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">Many such incidents later, =
I once saw myself riding my motorbike on a familiar road. Near a turn, I sa=
w a girl coming from the opposite direction. I was awestruck by her beauty.=
 I even started wondering about the possibility of finding a common friend =
or something and meeting her so that things could move in the romantically =
right direction.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">That very moment, a t=
ruck came out of nowhere and crushed me to death.<br clear=3D"none"><br cle=
ar=3D"none">The vision was so shockingly realistic, it took me a while to r=
ealize that I hadn't actually died. I couldn't shake off the aftereffects o=
f the experience. The surreal pain, the idea of an abrupt ending of my unac=
complished life and the worry about my parents overwhelmed me to the core. =
I knew, there was no way to prevent it; still, I vowed never to go down tha=
t road again.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">The vision continued rep=
eating itself with a little more detail each day. In a matter of day, I kne=
w the time of the incident; the make, color and number of the truck; detail=
s about the girl's clothes and makeup; and virtually everything around. One=
 day, the vision stopped just as suddenly as it had started.<br clear=3D"no=
ne"><br clear=3D"none">Time passed by, life took over the thoughts of death=
 and I almost forgot that vision.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">I've=
 always believed that whatever happens, happens for a reason. Something as =
common as fatigue, too, has to have a purpose. That was a day like any othe=
r with a slight difference. I was tired, a little less involved than usual =
in the physical world, roaming the streets on my own accord, I didn't reali=
ze that I had taken a wrong turn towards the forbidden road. I didn't need =
to have a d=C3=A9j=C3=A0 vu to understand the happenings around me.<br clea=
r=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">"So, this is it", I thought. In a way, I had =
accepted it and since I had had plenty of time to prepare, I was sure of th=
e best possible outcome. Nobody can cheat death so it was pointless to even=
 try. Things hurriedly moved forward the way they were supposed to and ther=
e she was exactly as I had seen her in my vision.<br clear=3D"none"><br cle=
ar=3D"none">Beauty is to be admired. Amazing beauty, like hers, can make th=
e time slow down. And it did. In the distance, I could hear the roar of a p=
owerful engine - cracking, uneven sound - approaching me at a thundering sp=
eed. I could feel my skin collide with the air displaced by a voluminous ob=
ject. My heart was pounding with all its might, as if it was trying to beat=
 as many times as it would have, had it not been its time to prematurely st=
op.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">Beauty is to die for. I took a dee=
p breath, probably my last, and gazed upon her face one last time. One must=
 think about something very beautiful in their last moments. There was some=
thing more beautiful than the girl which I had ignored all along.<br clear=
=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">Sometimes, it is good not to think. Sometimes,=
 it is better not to worry about consequences. Sometimes, it is best not to=
 follow rules. Sometimes, it is awesome to be riding on a single lane road.=
<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">I swerved my motorbike at an insane a=
ngle, narrowly missed a few motorbikes coming from the opposite direction a=
nd barely avoided hitting a tree on the other side of the road. The truck a=
lso took a wild turn and passed right through the spot where I would've bee=
n had I not taken that drastic step.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">I=
 looked around but couldn't find the girl anywhere. Either she was a figmen=
