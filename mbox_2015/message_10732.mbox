Namaste,
I was seeing this thread. Two small comments, feel free to ignore =
them if they don't make sense.
Firstly it is indeed true that for many trad=
itional practices a Guru is needed, however it is neither sanguine nor fail=
-proof, by which I mean there are often cases where even Guru may not be ab=
le to save a disciple from a certain kind of experience. One of the main re=
asons being in this point of Kali Yuga realistically speaking getting a Gur=
u who has the Shakti and the Divine connect to pull a disciple off or cushi=
on the disciple from all experiences or prepare the disciple properly and m=
ake experiences digestible is quite rare to find. Gurus are many, but Gurus=
 who can really control these stuff and give the right kind of Shakti are v=
ery very rare, and it does not matter whether they are in some sampradaya o=
r outside of all sampradaya.=C2=A0
In such an environment doing ones own sa=
dhana without waiting for a formal Guru is not a bad idea. Regarding homas =
there are two kinds of homas. One where it is a process to connect to God u=
sing Agni Tattwa. When one prays in a temple to an idol one is trying to us=
e Prithiwi Tattwa. Otherwise, in principle, both are similar. Of course pra=
ctical differences exist and that is due to the difference in the nature of=
 the two great elements.=C2=A0
Then there is the homa done for Kriya-s or s=
pecific results. That is complex and may require guidance. But I think PVR =
mentions in his manuals that he does not encourage such homas or one should=
 ideally use these only for the purpose of worshiping deities.

I started m=
y first homa in 2007 when I did not know PVR or even this website. Infact I=
 come from an environment when is not particularly religious or ritualistic=
 and I had frankly never even seen a homa. But the year before that I had a=
 strange and chance encounter with a spiritual man - who refuses to be addr=
essed as a Guru - and he inspired me to try out spiritualiy. I became curio=
us and started sadhana with mantra japa. Then one day I felt a strong desir=
e to do homas. I asked some people around me and all of them unanimously to=
ld me not to do so. I still did anyway. =C2=A0Since then it has been nearly=
 9 years I have been doing homas to different deities. Of course in between=
 now and then I have come across more advaced yogis who have kidly helped m=
e or directed me or told me a step here and step there, rest I just kept wa=
lking. This led to some experiences too over the years. But none of these y=
ogis were really traditional Gurus, nor did anyone ever give me formal diks=
ha.
One of the main sadhanas which I was fortunate enough to do was Chandi =
homas. I remember one day I came across a very traditional individual who w=
as shocked when I told him that I do this sadhana. He insisted that it cann=
ot be done like this and it needs a guru and a diksha otherwise strong nega=
tive consequences are bound to come due to the wrath of the Mother. Now I t=
end to get bit aggressive when I find condescending people. So I told him t=
hat I have done more than 500 Chandi homas (after which I have stopped coun=
ting) and not only done them inside my home but in ancient and powerful Sha=
kti peethas, in deserted locales, in off beat places, but places fit for Sh=
akti sadhana, where many ordinary people would not venture easily. Now if h=
e really believed what he said, that would mean that the Mother must have a=
llowed me to do these, for I did not face any wrath but only more opportuni=
ties to intensify the sadhana. So I am assuming the big boss is OK with me =
doing things in a non-traditional fashion. He had nothing more to say.=C2=
=A0
I am not saying or suggesting that tradition is wrong, it is there for =
a purpose but getting the spirit of the rules in Tradition is far more impo=
rtant than blind following of the same. Traditions exist for the Deity, not=
 the other way round. And given the point in time where we are, I am afraid=
 there will be more and more souls who will worship and eventually interact=
 with Deities outside of formal traditions. For a soul who has done sadhana=
 and wants to do so, will always do so, Nature and the Deity will make it h=
appen, irrespective of whether s/he lines up with a tradition or not, wheth=
er s/he is born in India or South Pole. This is the new reality.
On the oth=
er hand if the mind has doubts about consequences of going in a non-traditi=
onal manner, then one is better off not doing so. Because doubts make the s=
adhana go wrong, and the mind itself will cause more obstructions that anyo=
ne or anything else. Mind can be our best friend in the path, or our worst =
enemy.

* =C2=A0 =C2=A0 * =C2=A0 =C2=A0 *
Coming to the dream that you saw,=
 I would say it was a very significant dream. =C2=A0Snakes in dreams can ha=
ve various meanings. Not all are good. But this one seems to me like a indi=
cation of a very specific kind of spiritual expeirence to come, or would ha=
ve come to you, had you not made any change =C2=A0in your routine sadhana.=
=C2=A0
Spirituality has two parts. We start off with a desire to experience=
 God, we do whatever we think can help us in that, which can lead to experi=
ences which tell us we maybe come a bit closer. Then comes digesting them. =
To do so one has to have a stable mental and emotional condition.
From what=
 you described my sanguine feeling is that a strong experience was coming y=
our way, but doubt and fear stopped it and made it recede back. Now spiritu=
al experiences are not like daily states of consciousness. If they were, th=
ey would be no good. They are different. And that came make us feel unnerve=
d at times.
Did this happen due to homa? I think it was destined for you at=
 some point. It could as well have happened one early morning as you were h=
aving a cup of tea without lifting a finger. What sadhana does - by which I=
 mean homa, japa, yoga whatever - is change the patterns of karma and accel=
erate the experiences that would have come to you anyway. But more than tha=
t it helps your mind-body to stabilize which is vital to be able to integra=
te and digest an experience when it comes.=C2=A0
So without thinking about =
it I would suggest that you keep doing sadhana, whatever it maybe. As you d=
o more, you nervous system will grow stronger, your emotional, and mental s=
heath with become calmer and stabler and maybe the next time the Snake come=
s you won't feel unnerved! -:)
Wish you all the best.

=C2=A0Even I was curious . The mantras=

>Firstly it is indeed true that for many traditional practices a Guru is ne=
eded, however it is neither sanguine nor fail-proof, by which I mean there =
are often cases where even Guru may not be able to save a disciple from a c=
ertain kind of experience. One of the main reasons being in this point of K=
ali Yuga realistically speaking getting a Guru who has the Shakti and the D=
ivine connect to pull a disciple off or cushion the disciple from all exper=
iences or prepare the disciple properly and make experiences digestible is =
quite rare to find. Gurus are many, but Gurus who can really control these =
stuff and give the right kind of Shakti are very very rare, and it does not=
 matter whether they are in some sampradaya or outside of all sampradaya.&n=

without waiting for a formal Guru is not a bad idea. Regarding homas there =
are two kinds of homas. One where it is a process to connect to God using A=
gni Tattwa. When one prays in a temple to an idol one is trying to use Prit=
hiwi Tattwa. Otherwise, in principle, both are similar. Of course practical=
 differences exist and that is due to the difference in the nature of the t=

Infact I come from an environment when is not particularly religious or rit=

 I had a strange and chance encounter with a spiritual man - who refuses to=
 be addressed as a Guru - and he inspired me to try out spiritualiy. I beca=
me curious and started sadhana with mantra japa. Then one day I felt a stro=
ng desire to do homas. I asked some people around me and all of them unanim=
ously told me not to do so. I still did anyway.  Since then it has bee=
n nearly 9 years I have been doing homas to different deities. Of course in=
 between now and then I have come across more advaced yogis who have kidly =
helped me or directed me or told me a step here and step there, rest I just=
 kept walking. This led to some experiences too over the years. But none of=
 these yogis were really traditional Gurus, nor did anyone ever give me for=

in sadhanas which I was fortunate enough to do was Chandi homas. I remember=
 one day I came across a very traditional individual who was shocked when I=
 told him that I do this sadhana. He insisted that it cannot be done like t=
his and it needs a guru and a diksha otherwise strong negative consequences=
 are bound to come due to the wrath of the Mother. Now I tend to get bit ag=
gressive when I find condescending people. So I told him that I have done m=
ore than 500 Chandi homas (after which I have stopped counting) and not onl=
y done them inside my home but in ancient and powerful Shakti peethas, in d=
eserted locales, in off beat places, but places fit for Shakti sadhana, whe=
re many ordinary people would not venture easily. Now if he really believed=
 what he said, that would mean that the Mother must have allowed me to do t=
hese, for I did not face any wrath but only more opportunities to intensify=
 the sadhana. So I am assuming the big boss is OK with me doing things in a=
 non-traditional fashion. He had nothing more to say. </span></div><di=
