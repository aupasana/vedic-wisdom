Namaste,
I was seeing t=
his thread. Two small comments, feel free to ignore them if they don't make=
 sense.
Firstly it is indeed true that for many traditional practices a Gur=
u is needed, however it is neither sanguine nor fail-proof, by which I mean=
 there are often cases where even Guru may not be able to save a disciple f=
rom a certain kind of experience. One of the main reasons being in this poi=
nt of Kali Yuga realistically speaking getting a Guru who has the Shakti an=
d the Divine connect to pull a disciple off or cushion the disciple from al=
l experiences or prepare the disciple properly and make experiences digesti=
ble is quite rare to find. Gurus are many, but Gurus who can really control=
 these stuff and give the right kind of Shakti are very very rare, and it d=
oes not matter whether they are in some sampradaya or outside of all sampra=
daya.=C2=A0
In such an environment doing ones own sadhana without waiting f=
or a formal Guru is not a bad idea. Regarding homas there are two kinds of =
homas. One where it is a process to connect to God using Agni Tattwa. When =
one prays in a temple to an idol one is trying to use Prithiwi Tattwa. Othe=
rwise, in principle, both are similar. Of course practical differences exis=
t and that is due to the difference in the nature of the two great elements=
.=C2=A0
Then there is the homa done for Kriya-s or specific results. That i=
s complex and may require guidance. But I think PVR mentions in his manuals=
 that he does not encourage such homas or one should ideally use these only=
 for the purpose of worshiping deities.

I started my first homa in 2007 wh=
en I did not know PVR or even this website. Infact I come from an environme=
nt when is not particularly religious or ritualistic and I had frankly neve=
r even seen a homa. But the year before that I had a strange and chance enc=
ounter with a spiritual man - who refuses to be addressed as a Guru - and h=
e inspired me to try out spiritualiy. I became curious and started sadhana =
with mantra japa. Then one day I felt a strong desire to do homas. I asked =
some people around me and all of them unanimously told me not to do so. I s=
till did anyway. =C2=A0Since then it has been nearly 9 years I have been do=
ing homas to different deities. Of course in between now and then I have co=
me across more advaced yogis who have kidly helped me or directed me or tol=
d me a step here and step there, rest I just kept walking. This led to some=
 experiences too over the years. But none of these yogis were really tradit=
ional Gurus, nor did anyone ever give me formal diksha.
One of the main sad=
hanas which I was fortunate enough to do was Chandi homas. I remember one d=
ay I came across a very traditional individual who was shocked when I told =
him that I do this sadhana. He insisted that it cannot be done like this an=
d it needs a guru and a diksha otherwise strong negative consequences are b=
ound to come due to the wrath of the Mother. Now I tend to get bit aggressi=
ve when I find condescending people. So I told him that I have done more th=
an 500 Chandi homas (after which I have stopped counting) and not only done=
 them inside my home but in ancient and powerful Shakti peethas, in deserte=
d locales, in off beat places, but places fit for Shakti sadhana, where man=
y ordinary people would not venture easily. Now if he really believed what =
he said, that would mean that the Mother must have allowed me to do these, =
for I did not face any wrath but only more opportunities to intensify the s=
adhana. So I am assuming the big boss is OK with me doing things in a non-t=
raditional fashion. He had nothing more to say.=C2=A0
I am not saying or su=
ggesting that tradition is wrong, it is there for a purpose but getting the=
 spirit of the rules in Tradition is far more important than blind followin=
g of the same. Traditions exist for the Deity, not the other way round. And=
 given the point in time where we are, I am afraid there will be more and m=
ore souls who will worship and eventually interact with Deities outside of =
formal traditions. For a soul who has done sadhana and wants to do so, will=
 always do so, Nature and the Deity will make it happen, irrespective of wh=
ether s/he lines up with a tradition or not, whether s/he is born in India =
or South Pole. This is the new reality.
On the other hand if the mind has d=
oubts about consequences of going in a non-traditional manner, then one is =
better off not doing so. Because doubts make the sadhana go wrong, and the =
mind itself will cause more obstructions that anyone or anything else. Mind=
 can be our best friend in the path, or our worst enemy.

* =C2=A0 =C2=A0 *=
 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 *
Coming to the dream that you saw, I would say it was a ver=
y significant dream. =C2=A0Snakes in dreams can have various meanings. Not =
all are good. But this one seems to me like a indication of a very specific=
 kind of spiritual expeirence to come, or would have come to you, had you n=
ot made any change =C2=A0in your routine sadhana.=C2=A0
Spirituality has tw=
o parts. We start off with a desire to experience God, we do whatever we th=
ink can help us in that, which can lead to experiences which tell us we may=
be come a bit closer. Then comes digesting them. To do so one has to have a=
 stable mental and emotional condition.
From what you described my sanguine=
 feeling is that a strong experience was coming your way, but doubt and fea=
r stopped it and made it recede back. Now spiritual experiences are not lik=
e daily states of consciousness. If they were, they would be no good. They =
are different. And that came make us feel unnerved at times.
Did this happe=
n due to homa? I think it was destined for you at some point. It could as w=
ell have happened one early morning as you were having a cup of tea without=
 lifting a finger. What sadhana does - by which I mean homa, japa, yoga wha=
tever - is change the patterns of karma and accelerate the experiences that=
 would have come to you anyway. But more than that it helps your mind-body =
to stabilize which is vital to be able to integrate and digest an experienc=
e when it comes.=C2=A0
So without thinking about it I would suggest that yo=
u keep doing sadhana, whatever it maybe. As you do more, you nervous system=
 will grow stronger, your emotional, and mental sheath with become calmer a=
nd stabler and maybe the next time the Snake comes you won't feel unnerved!=
 -:)
Wish you all the best.

=C2=A0Even I was curious . The mantras I was chanting were reverbe=

down with fever and electric shocks.
I am not doing homam. My father =C2=A0=
is against it from=C2=A0=C2=A0 the beginning. This incident made him =C2=A0=
take =C2=A0a strong stand that it is no good.
=C2=A0I =C2=A0am also looking=

 strange and chance encounter with a spiritual man - who refuses to be addr=
essed as a Guru - and he inspired me to try out spiritualiy. I became curio=

e to do homas. I asked some people around me and all of them unanimously to=
ld me not to do so. I still did anyway.  Since then it has been nearly=
 9 years I have been doing homas to different deities. Of course in between=
 now and then I have come across more advaced yogis who have kidly helped m=
e or directed me or told me a step here and step there, rest I just kept wa=
