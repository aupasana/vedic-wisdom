Namasttay Shri Phil Stinnet ji and Everyone,

[Phil Stinnet [philstinnet@...] Sun 3/16/2014 2:23 AM:]
Very beautiful article. 
[Kannan:]
Thanks for your kind appreciation.

[Phil Stinnet [philstinnet@...] Sun 3/16/2014 2:23 AM:]
If i understood it correctly, here is the summary - 
1) Aatma has various names e.g. self, supreme being, para brahman,
consciousness, existence, chaitanya or awareness.
[Kannan:]
Aatma does not have any name. Name accompanies form. As Aatma is beyond any
form, space or time, it does not have any name. Gnyaanis call it ParaBrahma,
Yogis call it Aatma, Muslims call it Allah, Christian call it Father in
Heaven. These names are given by us. Aatma on its own is nameless. Yet it is
our problem that we need to call it or mention it with some name for our
discussion.

[Phil Stinnet [philstinnet@...] Sun 3/16/2014 2:23 AM:]
2) Aatma just exists and nothing else exists.
[Kannan:]
Yes. Very Good. Whatever we see in this world is Aatma in form and name. But
it is still Aatma. Like for example, we see a golden bangle. What exist?
Gold? Or bangle? If I melt the bangle, it becomes a lump of gold. So
technically a bangle is a gold with a format. So this world we see is Aatma
in a format. What exists without format is Aatma, What exists with format is
Aatma again. This is the true tatva-gnyaana that Gnyaanis see. Avidya causes
to see bangle in gold. And cry for bangle, when it loses its format and
becomes a lump of gold. They become happy when bangle is formed out of gold
and sad when bangle is dismantled back to gold. But there never existed any
bangle before. So how it can exist now? It is the gold which is existing
throughout.

Thus the "existence" of this world is only in mind or imagination, not in
absolute sense. In absolute sense, nothing exists other than Aatma.

[Phil Stinnet [philstinnet@...] Sun 3/16/2014 2:23 AM:]
3) Aatma has a center of desire. The ability to have the desire is a
permanent nature of Aatma.
[Kannan:]
Yes. Very Good. Aatma has Chitta where infinite latent vrittis are in a seed
form. To manifest itself from one to many during Srushti or Creation, and to
squeeze itself from many to one, during pralaya or dissolution, is like
breathing for Aatma. It cannot avoid this. It is its permanent nature. It is
its defining characteristics. There is no reason for this, As it is beyond
any cause-effect rule. This feature is like an Axiom which cannot be proven
with a precedence, because in order to prove, we need a statement which is
already proved. And to prove that one, we need another precedence statement,
so ultimately we need to start any proof with an Axiom which on its own is
proofless or does not require a proof. This is how Maths and Science are
studied. Every subject has an Axiom. We cannot go on endlessly proving every
statement.

For example, in geometry, the first axiom defined by Euclid is " A point is
something which cannot be measured and has no dimension." Now, you cannot
expect Euclid to prove this. Because these are Axioms. I hope it is clear.

[Phil Stinnet [philstinnet@...] Sun 3/16/2014 2:23 AM:]
4) When Aatma has manifested itself in its 'desire' form. It remains in the
three states - Waking, Dreaming, Sleeping.
Yes. Very Good.It witnesses all these states.

[Phil Stinnet [philstinnet@...] Sun 3/16/2014 2:23 AM:]
5) When Aatma is not in the 'desire' form. It is in the state of Moksha.
[Kannan:]
Yes. Very Good. Moksha is basically realizing one's true nature. Once Aatma
realizes its true nature, and gets freedom from Avidya or ignorance, it is
Moksha indeed. In that case, Aatma dwells without forming any further
vrittis out of avidya or ignorance, and burns it remaining vrittis either
though lifetimes or through the Grace of Guru Agni, which burns all vrittis.
Without the Grace-Agni of Guru, burning of vrittis is nearly impossible
because there are infinite vrittis, and one has to take infinite lifetimes
to drain or discharge them out, and in that process if one commits or
creates another vrittis, then the process is endless. 

Shrimach-Shankara-BhagavatPaada sang "Punarapi Janamam, Punarapi Maranam,
Punarapi Jananey Jatharey Shayanam,
                                                                "Iha
Sansaara, Bahu-Dustaara, Krupaya Paarey, Paahi Muraarey"

Meaning, "Again I take birth, Again I die, Again I sleep in womb of my
mother. This cycle of repeated lifetime is very intriguing and complicated,
Oh Muraari, please ferry me across this bottomless ocean of repeated
lifetimes."

[Phil Stinnet [philstinnet@...] Sun 3/16/2014 2:23 AM:]
Indeed it is a beautifully written article. I have few questions - 
[Kannan:]
Thanks again for your kind and well-meant appreciations. I will be glad to
answer provided with Grace and Blessings of The Ever-Existing Aatma in the
form Shri Gurudeva.

[Phil Stinnet [philstinnet@...] Sun 3/16/2014 2:23 AM:]
1) Why does Aatma exist ?
[Kannan:]
Let me do its mimaansa(analysis). Let me assume that your question is valid,
and hence assume that there does exist a valid answer.
Consider Event A : "aatma exist"
Consider Event B : "reasons or cause for event A".
If your answer is assumed to be existing, then event B must precede event A.
In other words, event A cannot occur, unless and until event B has occurred.
Now, if your question is assumed to be a valid one, then event B must also
cannot be stand-alone entity, but has to be supported by another preceding
event C.
Again, assuming your question to be valid and re-applied to event C, it must
have another precedence event D..and so on..till infinite endless loop.
In mathematics, whenever we encounter, infinite loops or forms, we call it
"indeterminate" or "undefined" like even in computer science you have this
concept. It's a hang-up.

So it is clear that answer to your question does not exist
deterministically. In such case, the question becomes invalid.

Now why this invalidity is occurring for a simple question? Because, the
question is valid only in domain of "cause-effect" linearity or circularity.
In such cases, you always have a preceding point for a given point. Aatma is
beyond all space, time, cause, effect etc. So you cannot apply this
principle of "cause-effect" to Aatma which itself is beyond this frame of
reference.

In other words, you cannot discuss or understand Aatma logically like what
we do to other entities in day-to-day life.

Forget about Aatma, take a very simple logical infinity loop, which fails
miserably to attain a stable logical state. I give you that example as
follows:
 In logic or propositional calculus, a line is called "statement", if it
attains either a "Truth value"(Binary 1) or a "False value"(Binary 0).But
not both simultanesouly, of course.

Can you imagine a line which never attains any of the truth or false value,
but keeps oscillating or shuttling between them? Well, let me share it.
A person says :" I always speak lies." Now, in logic, this is not called a
statement because it has no stable truth value or stable false value. How?
let me explain.

If the above line is true, then whatever he says is false(as he always
speaks lies). If whatever he says is false, then whatever he said must be
true.(because he said that he always speak lies, and this is false, so he
must be speaking truth.)

Puzzling? Well, this is called infinite loop or oscillation. The line "I
always speak lies", hence as per rules of propositional calculus, is not a
logical statement. So, logic fails miserably even in a mere line, then how
it can help us in defining or understanding Aatma?

So the bottomline is, Aatma is neither discussed nor explained nor logically
verified, rather it is realized. And one more thing, you cannot apply the
condition of "cause-effect" to one who is beyond all this. And your
question, is a typical "cause-effect" one; which violates head-on the very
definition of Aatma as one beyond all cause-effect, space, time etc.

[Phil Stinnet [philstinnet@...] Sun 3/16/2014 2:23 AM:]
2) Why does Aatma has this center of desire ? Who created it ?
[Kannan:]
The answer is almost similar to what I discussed in the preceding question.
Still I summarise here, Aatma by definition has Chitta, and none has created
it. It is its very nature. And Chitta also exist eternally. Anything which
is created will be dismantled or destroyed. Aatma is beyond any creation or
destruction.

[Phil Stinnet [philstinnet@...] Sun 3/16/2014 2:23 AM:]
3) Does a rock has Aatma too ? Do plants have Aatma too ?
[Kannan:]
Yes. They all are Aatma in various forms, with various levels of
consciousness trapped between the lowliest level to the highest level.
Whatever we perceive through senses, and whatever we do not perceive while
asleep, everything is Aatma only. One who realizes this gets freed from all
sorrows, and stays in Stitha-Pragnya Awastha as Shri Krushna mentioned in  
Shrimadh-Bhagawat-geet-opanishadam.

[Phil Stinnet [philstinnet@...] Sun 3/16/2014 2:23 AM:]
4) Why is this information (mentioned in the five points above) not easily
visible or experienced or felt ?
[Kannan:]
I am very happy to hear penetrative questions from you. Your eagerness to
know energizes me to answer you. Let me give you few examples.
Suppose I look down upon a still water filled with mud. Will I be able to
see my face? No. The mud creates a block in the water to reflect image
clearly.
But if I look down upon a clean and still water, Will I be able to see my
face? Yes. Because the water is in its true form to reflect.
So, why my face is not easily visible or experienced or felt in a muddy
water? Because of the mud polluting the water. Right? Fine.

Now, likewise, if manas(mind) is very busy or turbulent in engaging itself
in various outward activities of the 10 indriyas(5 sense and 5 action
organs), then such Ahankaara-chitta-buddhi-manas combo called jeevaatmaa is
said to be having a muddy water in an unstable, excited ever-active mind. In
other words, the outward orientation of mind is equivalent to a muddy water.
Under such extrovertness or bahir-mukhi-awastha, one cannot realize Aatma
and it remains forever invisible, un-experienced and un-felt.

So here is where the secret of All Saadhana lies. Which I cannot discuss now
as the post is getting lengthy.

[Phil Stinnet [philstinnet@...] Sun 3/16/2014 2:23 AM:]
5) How to know that what you have written is true ?
[Kannan:]
J..The answer is sweet and simple. By realizing Aatma, through quieting
one's mind. In Bible it is written "Be Still, And Know That I Am God". This
is the key. "Be Still". "Be Quiet". It's a mere two words, but it will
require pages to explain it and explore it. Once ArunagiriNathar asked Shri
Kaarthikeya to utter some knowledge of Aatma. Shri Shanmuga answered -
"Summaa Iru". Means "Be Quiet". Shri Dakshinamurthy Shiva is a 16 year old
Gurudeva, and who never utters anything, but all knowledge is understood and
Aatma is realized just being with him for a while. He is truly called
"Mauna-Guru".

[Phil Stinnet [philstinnet@...] Sun 3/16/2014 2:23 AM:]
Thanks a lot. It will be really helpful if you can answer these. I have more
questions. But, i will ask them later.
[Kannan:]
You are very welcome. It is my utmost pleasure to get the opportunity to
share my experience with your noble self. It is you who are doing me a favor
by giving me an opportunity to serve you, and accepting my humble service
with  pleasure, happiness, peace, satisfaction and blessings,
neglecting/ignoring the inherent flaws. This is verily a blessing for me, as
My Ishwara is pleased with me and has come in your form to accept my
offerings. I was roaming like an animal, and He showered His Grace and Love
and Mercy, and now again He has showered me with His Benign Looks, as He
comes in your form to accept my offerings. I seek Bhakti at His Holy Feet
and nothing else. May He Bless All of us with Bhakti at His Lotus-Like Holy
Feet.

I have truly expressed my heart's words. And it is not a jugglery of
high-sounding words, but a genuine voice of heart coming out like flowers
and reaching the Holy Feet of My Beloved Ishwara. You are always welcome for
any number of questions, and I always consider it as a worship to my Ishwara
while I answer them.

Let us conclude with a Tribute to the Aatma.
Aum Poornam-adah Poornam-idam Poornaat-Poornam-udachyatey
Poorn-asya Poornam-aadaaya Poornam-evaavashishyatey

Meaning, That is Full, This is Full, From That Full comes This Full,
                From This Full, remove That Full, what indeed remains is
That Full.

Aum Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih

With Kind Regards,
Kannan

2) Aatma just exists and nothing else =
exists.<br>
<b><u>[Kannan:]<br>
</u></b>Yes. Very Good. Whatever we see in =
this world is Aatma in form and
name. But it is still Aatma. Like for examp=
le, we see a golden bangle. What
exist? Gold? Or bangle? If I melt the bang=
le, it becomes a lump of gold. So
technically a bangle is a gold with a for=
mat. So this world we see is Aatma in a
format. What exists without format =
is Aatma, What exists with format is Aatma
again. This is the true tatva-gn=
yaana that Gnyaanis see. Avidya causes to see
bangle in gold. And cry for b=
angle, when it loses its format and becomes a lump
of gold. They become hap=
py when bangle is formed out of gold and sad when
bangle is dismantled back=
 to gold. But there never existed any bangle before.
So how it can exist no=
w? It is the gold which is existing throughout.<br>
<br>
Thus the “ex=
istence” of this world is only in mind or imagination,
not in absolut=
e sense. In absolute sense, nothing exists other than Aatma.<br>

3) Aatm=
a has a center of desire. The ability to have the desire is a permanent
nat=
ure of Aatma.<br>
<b><u>[Kannan:]<br>
</u></b>Yes. Very Good. Aatma has Chi=
tta where infinite latent vrittis are in a
seed form. To manifest itself fr=
om one to many during Srushti or Creation, and
to squeeze itself from many =
to one, during pralaya or dissolution, is like
breathing for Aatma. It cann=
ot avoid this. It is its permanent nature. It is
its defining characteristi=
cs. There is no reason for this, As it is beyond any
cause-effect rule. Thi=
s feature is like an Axiom which cannot be proven with a
precedence, becaus=
e in order to prove, we need a statement which is already
proved. And to pr=
ove that one, we need another precedence statement, so
ultimately we need t=
o start any proof with an Axiom which on its own is
proofless or does not r=
equire a proof. This is how Maths and Science are
studied. Every subject ha=
s an Axiom. We cannot go on endlessly proving every
statement.<br>
<br>
For=
 example, in geometry, the first axiom defined by Euclid is “ A point=

is something which cannot be measured and has no dimension.” Now, yo=
u
cannot expect Euclid to prove this. Because these are Axioms. I hope it i=
s
clear.<br>

5) When Aatma is not in the 'desi=

<b><u>[Kannan:]<br>
</u></b>Yes=
. Very Good. Moksha is basically realizing one’s true nature. Once
Aa=
tma realizes its true nature, and gets freedom from Avidya or ignorance, it=

is Moksha indeed. In that case, Aatma dwells without forming any further v=
rittis
out of avidya or ignorance, and burns it remaining vrittis either th=
ough
lifetimes or through the Grace of Guru Agni, which burns all vrittis. =
Without
the Grace-Agni of Guru, burning of vrittis is nearly impossible bec=
ause there
are infinite vrittis, and one has to take infinite lifetimes to =
drain or
discharge them out, and in that process if one commits or creates =
another
vrittis, then the process is endless. <br>

1) Why does Aatma exist ?<b=
r>
<b><u>[Kannan:]<br>
</u></b>Let me do its mimaansa(analysis). Let me ass=
ume that your question is
valid, and hence assume that there does exist a v=
alid answer.<br>
Consider Event A : “aatma exist”<br>
Consider =
Event B : “reasons or cause for event A”.<br>
If your answer is=
 assumed to be existing, then event B must precede event A. In
other words,=
 event A cannot occur, unless and until event B has occurred.<br>
Now, if y=
our question is assumed to be a valid one, then event B must also
cannot be=
 stand-alone entity, but has to be supported by another preceding
event C.<=
br>
Again, assuming your question to be valid and re-applied to event C, it=
 must
have another precedence event D..and so on..till infinite endless loo=
p.<br>
In mathematics, whenever we encounter, infinite loops or forms, we c=
all it “indeterminate”
or “undefined” like even in =
computer science you have this concept.
It’s a hang-up.<br>
<br>
So i=
t is clear that answer to your question does not exist deterministically. I=
n
such case, the question becomes invalid.<br>
<br>
Now why this invalidity=
 is occurring for a simple question? Because, the
question is valid only in=
 domain of “cause-effect” linearity or
circularity. In such cas=
es, you always have a preceding point for a given
point. Aatma is beyond al=
l space, time, cause, effect etc. So you cannot apply
this principle of =
220;cause-effect” to Aatma which itself is beyond
this frame of refer=
ence.<br>
<br>
In other words, you cannot discuss or understand Aatma logic=
ally like what we
do to other entities in day-to-day life.<br>
<br>
Forget =
about Aatma, take a very simple logical infinity loop, which fails
miserabl=
y to attain a stable logical state. I give you that example as follows:<br>=

 In logic or propositional calculus, a line is called “statemen=
t”,
if it attains either a “Truth value”(Binary 1) or a &=
#8220;False
value”(Binary 0).But not both simultanesouly, of course.<=
br>
<br>
Can you imagine a line which never attains any of the truth or fal=
se value, but
keeps oscillating or shuttling between them? Well, let me sha=
re it.<br>
A person says :” I always speak lies.” Now, in logic=
, this is not
called a statement because it has no stable truth value or st=
able false value. How?
let me explain.<br>
<br>
If the above line is true, =
then whatever he says is false(as he always speaks
lies). If whatever he sa=
ys is false, then whatever he said must be
true.(because he said that he al=
ways speak lies, and this is false, so he must
be speaking truth.)<br>
<br>=

Puzzling? Well, this is called infinite loop or oscillation. The line R=
21;I
always speak lies”, hence as per rules of propositional calculus=
, is not
a logical statement. So, logic fails miserably even in a mere line=
, then how it
can help us in defining or understanding Aatma?<br>
<br>
So t=
he bottomline is, Aatma is neither discussed nor explained nor logically
ve=
rified, rather it is realized. And one more thing, you cannot apply the
con=
dition of “cause-effect” to one who is beyond all this. And you=
r
question, is a typical “cause-effect” one; which violates hea=
d-on
the very definition of Aatma as one beyond all cause-effect, space, ti=
me etc.<br>

2) Why does Aatma has this center of desire ? Who created it=
 ?<br>
<b><u>[Kannan:]<br>
</u></b>The answer is almost similar to what I d=
iscussed in the preceding
question. Still I summarise here, Aatma by defini=
tion has Chitta, and none has created
it. It is its very nature. And Chitta=
 also exist eternally. Anything which is
created will be dismantled or dest=
royed. Aatma is beyond any creation or
destruction.<br>

4) Why is this information (mentione=
d in the five points above) not easily
visible or experienced or felt ?<br>=

<b><u>[Kannan:]<br>
</u></b>I am very happy to hear penetrative questions =
from you. Your eagerness
to know energizes me to answer you. Let me give yo=
u few examples.<br>
Suppose I look down upon a still water filled with mud.=
 Will I be able to see my
face? No. The mud creates a block in the water to=
 reflect image clearly.<br>
But if I look down upon a clean and still water=
, Will I be able to see my face?
Yes. Because the water is in its true form=
 to reflect.<br>
So, why my face is not easily visible or experienced or fe=
lt in a muddy water? Because
of the mud polluting the water. Right? Fine.<b=
r>
<br>
Now, likewise, if manas(mind) is very busy or turbulent in engaging=
 itself in
various outward activities of the 10 indriyas(5 sense and 5 acti=
on organs),
then such Ahankaara-chitta-buddhi-manas combo called jeevaatmaa=
 is said to be
having a muddy water in an unstable, excited ever-active min=
d. In other words,
the outward orientation of mind is equivalent to a muddy=
 water.<br>
Under such extrovertness or bahir-mukhi-awastha, one cannot rea=
lize Aatma and
it remains forever invisible, un-experienced and un-felt.<br=
>
<br>
So here is where the secret of All Saadhana lies. Which I cannot dis=
cuss now as
the post is getting lengthy.<br>

5) How to know that what yo=

.The
answer is sweet and simple. By realizing Aatma, through quieting one&#=
8217;s
mind. In Bible it is written “Be Still, And Know That I Am God=
”. This
is the key. “Be Still”. “Be Quiet”. I=
t’s a mere
two words, but it will require pages to explain it and exp=
lore it. Once ArunagiriNathar
asked Shri Kaarthikeya to utter some knowledg=
e of Aatma. Shri Shanmuga answered
-<br>
“Summaa Iru”. Means &#=
8220;Be Quiet”. Shri Dakshinamurthy Shiva
is a 16 year old Gurudeva, =
and who never utters anything, but all knowledge is
understood and Aatma is=
 realized just being with him for a while. He is truly
called “Mauna-=
Guru”.<br>

Thanks a lot. It will be really helpful if you can answ=
er these. I have more
questions. But, i will ask them later.<br>
<b><u>[Kan=
nan:]<br>
</u></b>You are very welcome. It is my utmost pleasure to get the=
 opportunity
to share my experience with your noble self. It is you who are=
 doing me a favor
by giving me an opportunity to serve you, and accepting m=
y humble service with 
pleasure, happiness, peace, satisfaction and bl=
essings, neglecting/ignoring the
inherent flaws. This is verily a blessing =
for me, as My Ishwara is pleased with
me and has come in your form to accep=
t my offerings. I was roaming like an
animal, and He showered His Grace and=
 Love and Mercy, and now again He has
showered me with His Benign Looks, as=
 He comes in your form to accept my
offerings. I seek Bhakti at His Holy Fe=
et and nothing else. May He Bless All of
us with Bhakti at His Lotus-Like H=
oly Feet.<br>
<br>
I have truly expressed my heart’s words. And it is=
 not a jugglery of
high-sounding words, but a genuine voice of heart coming=
 out like flowers and
reaching the Holy Feet of My Beloved Ishwara. You are=
 always welcome for any
number of questions, and I always consider it as a =
worship to my Ishwara while
I answer them.<br>
