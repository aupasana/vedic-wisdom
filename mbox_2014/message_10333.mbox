Respected Narasimha guru and other esteemed members of this forum

Happy Gu=
ru Purnima.

On the occasion of Guru purnima, =A0I am reaching out to ask a=
 question about Gyan Mudra which is related=A0with planet guru.
As we know =
Gyan mudra is advised to practice to enhance spirituality. Jain-Mahavir swa=
mi, Budh, Nanak all the saints=A0have been portrayed in Gyan mudra.

Accord=
ing to Ayurveda, Index finger which is used in the gyan mudra, is related w=
ith Vaayu=A0element. My question is -- if we practice gyan mudra - will it =
enhance vaayu element or balance it?=A0Guru is the planet of expansion. So =
if gyan mudra enhances vaayu element and that helps=A0in enhancing spiritua=
lity-- what if a native is suffering from high vaata =A0is Gyan mudra=A0adv=
isable for him or will it aggravate the vaata issue? =A0If it aggravates, i=
sn't it blocking his/her spiritual progress?

I have also read if we keep f=
inger upwards in the gyan mudra it enhance knowledge and if we keep fingers=
 downwards it grounds person and brings stability. I was wondering if membe=
rs can share their experiences and insights about gyan mudra.

Thanks

Vikr=
am
