1 last thing...this question is as old as humanity itself.....till today
the human intellect cannot provide a satisfactory answer...the philosophy
books from both the east n west...have all the arguments both ways if you
care to go through them.....if there is an answer....like i used to
wonder....during the time i was cracking my head......... it probably lies
beyond the intellect......some mystics say there is a faculty that is
beyond duality and what not deep within the human psyche.....with any
luck!...that would be the best bet!....otherwise its like a dog chasing its
own tail...or banging your head against a brick wall......you either go
crazy of give up!......no known philosopher has been able to give a proper
answer to date!....so as some of the seniors in this forum would
say!!.....its better to put forth the query to the universe...and be still.
