Dear Kannan,

>  "Aatma has a center of desire. The ability to have the desire is a
permanent nature of Aatma" ... Yes. Very Good. Aatma has Chitta where
infinite latent vrittis are in a seed form.

... Yes. Very Good. Moksha is basically realizing one's true nature. Once
Aatma realizes its true nature, and gets freedom from Avidya or ignorance,
it is Moksha indeed.


You seem to be trying to explain the advaita position. If this is true, you
are either misstating the position, or are using words with your own
definitions (eg. chitta).

For others in the thread -- if you wish to read a "summary" of the advaita
position, you can read the following link -- -

</u></b>Yes. Very Good. Whatever we see in this world is =
Aatma in form and
name. But it is still Aatma. Like for example, we see a g=
olden bangle. What
exist? Gold? Or bangle? If I melt the bangle, it becomes=
 a lump of gold. So
technically a bangle is a gold with a format. So this w=
orld we see is Aatma in a
format. What exists without format is Aatma, What=
 exists with format is Aatma
again. This is the true tatva-gnyaana that Gny=
aanis see. Avidya causes to see
bangle in gold. And cry for bangle, when it=
 loses its format and becomes a lump
of gold. They become happy when bangle=
 is formed out of gold and sad when
bangle is dismantled back to gold. But =
there never existed any bangle before.
So how it can exist now? It is the g=
old which is existing throughout.<br>
<br>
Thus the “existence”=
 of this world is only in mind or imagination,
not in absolute sense. In ab=
solute sense, nothing exists other than Aatma.<br>

3) Aatma has a center of=
 desire. The ability to have the desire is a permanent
nature of Aatma.<br>=

</div><b><u>[Kannan:]<br>
</u></b>Yes. Very Good. Aatma has Chitta where i=
nfinite latent vrittis are in a
seed form. To manifest itself from one to m=
any during Srushti or Creation, and
to squeeze itself from many to one, dur=
ing pralaya or dissolution, is like
breathing for Aatma. It cannot avoid th=
is. It is its permanent nature. It is
its defining characteristics. There i=
s no reason for this, As it is beyond any
cause-effect rule. This feature i=
s like an Axiom which cannot be proven with a
precedence, because in order =
to prove, we need a statement which is already
proved. And to prove that on=
e, we need another precedence statement, so
ultimately we need to start any=
 proof with an Axiom which on its own is
proofless or does not require a pr=
oof. This is how Maths and Science are
studied. Every subject has an Axiom.=
 We cannot go on endlessly proving every
statement.<br>
<br>
For example, i=
n geometry, the first axiom defined by Euclid is “ A point
is somethi=
ng which cannot be measured and has no dimension.” Now, you
cannot ex=
pect Euclid to prove this. Because these are Axioms. I hope it is
clear.<br=

5) When Aatma is not in the 'des=

</div><b><u>[Kannan:]<br>
=
</u></b>Yes. Very Good. Moksha is basically realizing one’s true natu=
re. Once
Aatma realizes its true nature, and gets freedom from Avidya or ig=
norance, it
is Moksha indeed. In that case, Aatma dwells without forming an=
y further vrittis
out of avidya or ignorance, and burns it remaining vritti=
s either though
lifetimes or through the Grace of Guru Agni, which burns al=
l vrittis. Without
the Grace-Agni of Guru, burning of vrittis is nearly imp=
ossible because there
are infinite vrittis, and one has to take infinite li=
fetimes to drain or
discharge them out, and in that process if one commits =
or creates another
vrittis, then the process is endless. <br>

1) Why does Aatma exist ?<br>
</div><b=
><u>[Kannan:]<br>
</u></b>Let me do its mimaansa(analysis). Let me assume t=
hat your question is
valid, and hence assume that there does exist a valid =
answer.<br>
Consider Event A : “aatma exist”<br>
Consider Event=
 B : “reasons or cause for event A”.<br>
If your answer is assu=
med to be existing, then event B must precede event A. In
other words, even=
t A cannot occur, unless and until event B has occurred.<br>
Now, if your q=
uestion is assumed to be a valid one, then event B must also
cannot be stan=
d-alone entity, but has to be supported by another preceding
event C.<br>
A=
gain, assuming your question to be valid and re-applied to event C, it must=

have another precedence event D..and so on..till infinite endless loop.<br=
>
In mathematics, whenever we encounter, infinite loops or forms, we call i=
t “indeterminate”
or “undefined” like even in compu=
ter science you have this concept.
It’s a hang-up.<br>
<br>
So it is =
clear that answer to your question does not exist deterministically. In
suc=
h case, the question becomes invalid.<br>
<br>
Now why this invalidity is o=
ccurring for a simple question? Because, the
question is valid only in doma=
in of “cause-effect” linearity or
circularity. In such cases, y=
ou always have a preceding point for a given
point. Aatma is beyond all spa=
ce, time, cause, effect etc. So you cannot apply
this principle of “c=
ause-effect” to Aatma which itself is beyond
this frame of reference.=
<br>
<br>
In other words, you cannot discuss or understand Aatma logically =
like what we
do to other entities in day-to-day life.<br>
<br>
Forget about=
 Aatma, take a very simple logical infinity loop, which fails
miserably to =
attain a stable logical state. I give you that example as follows:<br>
&nbs=
p;In logic or propositional calculus, a line is called “statement&rdq=
uo;,
if it attains either a “Truth value”(Binary 1) or a &ldquo=
;False
value”(Binary 0).But not both simultanesouly, of course.<br>
<=
br>
Can you imagine a line which never attains any of the truth or false va=
lue, but
keeps oscillating or shuttling between them? Well, let me share it=
.<br>
A person says :” I always speak lies.” Now, in logic, thi=
s is not
called a statement because it has no stable truth value or stable =
false value. How?
let me explain.<br>
<br>
If the above line is true, then =
whatever he says is false(as he always speaks
lies). If whatever he says is=
 false, then whatever he said must be
true.(because he said that he always =
speak lies, and this is false, so he must
be speaking truth.)<br>
<br>
Puzz=
ling? Well, this is called infinite loop or oscillation. The line ”I
=
always speak lies”, hence as per rules of propositional calculus, is =
not
a logical statement. So, logic fails miserably even in a mere line, the=
n how it
can help us in defining or understanding Aatma?<br>
<br>
So the bo=
ttomline is, Aatma is neither discussed nor explained nor logically
verifie=
d, rather it is realized. And one more thing, you cannot apply the
conditio=
n of “cause-effect” to one who is beyond all this. And your
que=
stion, is a typical “cause-effect” one; which violates head-on
=
the very definition of Aatma as one beyond all cause-effect, space, time et=
c.<br>

2) Why does Aatma has this center of desire ? Who created it ?<br>
<=
/div><b><u>[Kannan:]<br>
</u></b>The answer is almost similar to what I dis=
cussed in the preceding
question. Still I summarise here, Aatma by definiti=
on has Chitta, and none has created
it. It is its very nature. And Chitta a=
lso exist eternally. Anything which is
created will be dismantled or destro=
yed. Aatma is beyond any creation or
destruction.<br>

3) Does a rock has =

</div><b><u>[Kannan:]<br>

b>Yes. They all are Aatma in various forms, with various levels of
consciou=

we =
perceive through senses, and whatever we do not perceive while asleep, ever=
ything
is Aatma only. One who realizes this gets freed from all sorrows, an=

4) Why is this information (mentione=
d in the five points above) not easily
visible or experienced or felt ?<br>=

</div><b><u>[Kannan:]<br>
</u></b>I am very happy to hear penetrative ques=
tions from you. Your eagerness
to know energizes me to answer you. Let me g=
ive you few examples.<br>
Suppose I look down upon a still water filled wit=
h mud. Will I be able to see my
face? No. The mud creates a block in the wa=
ter to reflect image clearly.<br>
But if I look down upon a clean and still=
 water, Will I be able to see my face?
Yes. Because the water is in its tru=
e form to reflect.<br>
So, why my face is not easily visible or experienced=
 or felt in a muddy water? Because
of the mud polluting the water. Right? F=
ine.<br>
<br>
Now, likewise, if manas(mind) is very busy or turbulent in en=
gaging itself in
various outward activities of the 10 indriyas(5 sense and =
5 action organs),
then such Ahankaara-chitta-buddhi-manas combo called jeev=
aatmaa is said to be
having a muddy water in an unstable, excited ever-acti=
ve mind. In other words,
the outward orientation of mind is equivalent to a=
 muddy water.<br>
Under such extrovertness or bahir-mukhi-awastha, one cann=
ot realize Aatma and
it remains forever invisible, un-experienced and un-fe=
lt.<br>
<br>
So here is where the secret of All Saadhana lies. Which I cann=
ot discuss now as
the post is getting lengthy.<br>
