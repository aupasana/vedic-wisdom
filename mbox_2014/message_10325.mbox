Dear daughter,
Shifting house, profession, status of living, marriage etc a=
re stepping stones in anyone's life journey. One thinks to shift house to g=
et better amenities, more comfort, peace, happiness, security and good neig=
hborhood etc. so in any event the change must bring betterment and not a re=
verse progress.
If you wanted to learn to ride a bicycle, can you start at =
any time, any where, any manner? 
Obviously no. The time should be such tha=
t there is plenty of light, no stormy wind, no dust, no rain, no traffic ob=
struction. The place should not be an up-elevated road or area, because tha=
t requires cycling with more effort . It should be sloping, so that the cyc=
le goes freely and you can concentrate on road and balancing. So you need t=
o select a time, place and procedure.
Similarly for anything to be done the=
re are right times, right procedures, right places etc.
In a new house( whe=
re you are going to shift) there may be some families or individuals before=
 you enter. The premises get used to the behavior of those, the negative op=
posite energy is likely to be present there. So you have to neutralize thes=
e negative unwanted energies from the premises by chanting of Vedic hymns, =
Fire and Water rituals etc. the timings are linked with the motion of plane=
ts out of which everyone knows about Sun, Moon, Jupiter, Venus, Mercury,Mar=
s, Saturn eats. The individually and as a group create certain energies and=
 situations. So the person moving there should get compatibility with such =
group activity.
So is always better that we choose a time, a day, a manner =
of entering and c,
Leaning before entering.
Hence it is advisable that to l=
ook for an auspicious time which to some extent reduce the unnecessary prob=
lems and start a prosperous future life.
House warming is to create such po=
sitive energies and also to clear the previous pollution by the earlier dwe=
llers. It may as convenient as possible. A Fire ritual called Homa, a water=
 ritual called abhishekam, a cleaning ritual called Punyahavachanam,  a poo=
ja with chanting Vedic hymns etc.
It is also dependent on the purpose of th=
e entering the house. When you wanted to stay for  a longer duration , you =
have to enter at a time when Sun is in A fixed sign like Leo. A cardinal or=
 moving sign results in quick shift from that event. If you wanted to go to=
 a hospital at your choice, select a  movable sign for hospital admission, =
if you can wait, so that you will not be fixed to hospital.
If you want to =
strike it wrong on the face of it, you will loose lot of the facility and h=
appiness given by nature.
So final answer is chose an auspicious time, do s=
ome kind do house warming, get to the type of previous dwellers, and if you=
 want to stay for long duration do it in a fixed sign, I.e. Sun in a fixed =
sign like Leo. From 21st June to 21st July Sun will be in cancer a cardinal=
 sign and later after July 22nd, in Leo and Sravana Masa please shift.
If y=
ou have strong will and leadership qualities and strength, you can do it on=
 any day, provided your good nature, service, sacred character, love and he=
lping nature and disciplined life will assist you in all measures of good w=
ork in spite of any day.
Loving blessings
KBKM.
