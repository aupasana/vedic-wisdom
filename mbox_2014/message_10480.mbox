Namaste Sir,

Your thinking is quite refined and elevated!

Let me probe a little bit on the edges though! :-)

<<similarly when narayan loka is above all lokas,why should we not concentrate on NARAYANA even in shradh days and request HIM to give MOKSHA to all those ancestors of ours who could not be liberated>>

Sure we can! But Narayana won't give it to them until they themselves also want it and are ready for it. Those who are lost in petty desires will not think of Narayana and moksha.

Let us go back to my analogy. Suppose a co-passeger in a train journey is searching for a lost 2G phone, yelling fussily and disturbing your work. If you tell him you will buy a 4G phone for him after leaving the train, it may not pacify him. He may be too attached to his 2G phone and continue to yell! You can try to talk sense, but it may be simpler and wiser to just help him find his 2G phone!

<<what i feel that we should remain commited to our duties towards our family and should have deep concern for the family as this is part of our karma BUT our attachments should only be with the GOD.
the moment we start deviating our attachments from God to family,we start expecting something in return to what we have done for the family and that is the root cause of all frustrations.So it is good to be concerned than getting attached.>>


We can talk of love for and attachment to God. But, how do you think of and love the Supreme Cosmic Being who is in every being and in every atom and yet beyond our conception and imagination? How can you love, become attached to and serve what you cannot even conceive or fathom?


As people around us are the limited manifestations of God, isn't serving them a way to serve God and loving them a way to love God?!

However, your point about expecting something in return is correct. When we do something for someone, we consciously or sub-consciously expect something in return (at least gratitude or even acknowledgment, if nothing else). But, if one has this attitude, it can extend to God too. One can worship God and do many rituals and expect something in return even there ("moksha" or other kinds of spiritual progress).

Why can't the ability to do things without expecting something in return be developed and honed while doing things for others?

Detachment is different from either aversion or a fear of attachment! Detachment implies neither a dry mental state devoid of emotion nor a grudging discharge of responsibility.

Isn't it possible to look at people as limited manifestations of God, who are worshiped/served in different ways by offering different services, offer those services thinking of them as limited manifestations of God, taking pleasure in their enjoyment of the services offered by you, and yet not expect anything in return, not even gratitude or acknowledgement? Isn't that a beginning to the development of detachment?

Isn't the entire world you interact with is a limited manifestation of God and aren't all your actions towards the world your offerings to God?

Best regards,
Narasimha
