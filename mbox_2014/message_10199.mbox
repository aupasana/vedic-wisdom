and remember that no ones answer will ever suffice!!!you gotta keep
asking..trying,searching,till you so called get it..even then who is to
know?...and what is there to get?...who or what gets
enlightened?...epistemology!....how do you know what you
know??????????..........i kinda like ramana`s who or what is it that
actually knows???...these things transcend the mind which is based on
duality...and that state which you are in is the persona created by the
mind....its all a web of ideas fabricated by the mind....thoughts are ideas
encapsulated in sound....and ideas form the very fabric of this
reality....pleasure and pain is the motivating factor in our psyche...so do
the maths...as silly as it may sound...doing nothing is the answer!!but its
not a nothing achieved by doing it!...god bless!...i,m as lost as you
are!..hope i helped.
