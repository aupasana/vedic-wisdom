i think the answer would be which timing works for you!..there cant be
absolute rules these days....what about the night shift workers for whom
twilight will feel like dawn?....i guess the best time would be when you
feel your mind to be naturally quiet and introspective...whatever the clock
says!...of course there are textbook timings....but i think it would be
best to find ones own rythm in these matters.....with regards.
