Dear Amit,

There are many different "standard" procedures for worshipping rudra. In
some procedures, the focus is not on the abhisheka, and the rudram /
chamakam are not recited. The bodhayana shesha sutras (for those who learn
the krishna yajur veda) have a procedure for the daily worship of rudra
(mahAdevasya aharahaH paricaryAvidhiH). Here, in the abhisheka portion, the
main mantras recited are the "hiranyavarniiyaa" and "pavamaana" suktas. The
most common procedure for rudrAbhisheka includes the laghunyasa, followed
by abhisheka with the rudra and chamaka mantras.

Narasimha has included the standard "shodashopachara puja" in his homam
manuals. You can just follow this. If you want to use more flowers, then
you can offer 108 or 1008 flowers (with the same mantra, or while chanting
108 / 1008 names) before saying "puShpam samarpayAmi". If you want to do a
longer abhisheka, then you can repeat the mantra of your choice before
saying "snAnam samarpayAmi". No particular mantra is required .... re-read
point #3 from Narasimha's reply below.

Generally speaking, it is reasonable to expect trained priests who follow
the krishna yajur veda to recite both the rudra and chamaka. However, the
rudra prashna is the more important of the two. This is why we repeat only
the rudra portion many times (11, 121 etc) when we do a more elaborate
version of the rudrabhisheka. An even simpler way is to recite the "rudra
sukta" which has only 6 mantras, most of which are from the rudra prashna.
Or, simply recite the mrityunjaya mantra or the panchakshari. There are
many options.

sasneham,

    ajit
