 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Dear Amit,
 =

 =C2=A0There are many different "standard"
 
 =C2=A0procedures for worship=
ping rudra. In some procedures, the
 
 =C2=A0focus is not on the abhisheka,=
 and the rudram / chamakam
 are
 
 =C2=A0not recited. The bodhayana shesha =
sutras (for those who
 
 =C2=A0learn the krishna yajur veda) have a procedu=
re for the
 daily
 
 =C2=A0worship of rudra (mahAdevasya aharahaH paricaryA=
vidhiH).
 
 =C2=A0Here, in the abhisheka portion, the main mantras recited
=
 are
 
 =C2=A0the "hiranyavarniiyaa" and
 "pavamaana"
 
 =C2=A0suktas. The =
most common procedure for rudrAbhisheka
 includes
 
 =C2=A0the laghunyasa, =
followed by abhisheka with the rudra and
 
 =C2=A0chamaka mantras.=C2=A0
 
=
 
 
 
 
 =C2=A0Narasimha has included the standard
 
 =C2=A0"shodashopachar=
a puja" in his homam manuals.
 You
 
 =C2=A0can just follow this. If you wa=
nt to use more flowers,
 then
 
 =C2=A0you can offer 108 or 1008 flowers (w=
ith the same mantra,
 or
 
 =C2=A0while chanting 108 / 1008 names) before s=
aying
 "puShpam
 
 =C2=A0samarpayAmi". If you want to do a longer abhisheka=
,
 
 =C2=A0then you can repeat the mantra of your choice before
 saying
 
 =
=C2=A0"snAnam samarpayAmi". No particular mantra is
 
 =C2=A0required .... =
re-read point #3 from Narasimha's reply
 
 =C2=A0below.
 
 
 
 
 
 =C2=A0Ge=
nerally speaking, it is reasonable to expect
 
 =C2=A0trained priests who f=
ollow the krishna yajur veda to
 recite
 
 =C2=A0both the rudra and chamaka=
. However, the rudra prashna is
 
 =C2=A0the more important of the two. Thi=
s is why we repeat only
 
 =C2=A0the rudra portion many times (11, 121 etc)=
 when we do a
 more
 
 =C2=A0elaborate version of the rudrabhisheka. An eve=
n simpler
 way
 
 =C2=A0is to recite the "rudra sukta" which has only 6
 
 =
=C2=A0mantras, most of which are from the rudra prashna. Or,
 
 =C2=A0simpl=
y recite the mrityunjaya mantra or the panchakshari.
