=C2=A0Dear Narasimha,

Interesting points.. specially the second point yo=
u mentioned.

The chief reason why I replied to this thread is the peculiar=
 and stringent belief which I come across quite often, that non-veg food ha=
bits, alochol or tobacco automatically means a person is not spiritual. Tha=
t is so not true in reality. If that were so then almost all the ancient He=
brew prophets, or so many of the genuinely good sufi saints would have to b=
e considered non-spiritual, and that is clear untrue.

Food is important, b=
ut IMHO it is - at least for a long time initially - of much lesser importa=
nce than inner-purity, concentration, surrender, aspiration, transformation=
 of ego etc and those basic qualities which are the pillars on which true a=
wakening and spirituality stands. 

It is probably for this reason that Swa=
mi Vivekananda, when laying down the rules for the monks of the Ramakrishna=
 Mission wrote down that food would be in moderation but as per the local c=
ustoms or cultural background of the sadhaka. Hence the Mission in Bengal s=
erves fish while that in Maharastra is strictly vegetarian. I find it a ver=
y mature and far sighted stance from the Swami..

*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

In my personal sadhana I have found some food to have a =
devastating effect. Not veg or non-veg, but pickles and some specific kinds=
 of pickles. They short-circuit the nervous system instantly and hence I av=
oid them as far as possible.=C2=A0 Otherwise, less intake of food during sa=
dhana is very helpful.


-Regards

Dear Rajarshi,

You hit it on the nail: "The whole stor=
y is inside, externals are useful to the extent they aid the inner journey.=
 IMHO, no hard and fast one-rule-fits all can ever be made on the externals=
. Millions of humans, millions of tendencies, millions of nuances in their =
paths."

That said, some generic external guidelines in simple top level ma=
tters ARE indeed useful for a majority of people (though not all). Vegetari=
an, and particularly sattwik, diet is definitely one such thing.

*=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0 *

During final exams in my 12th grade, I went to a late night film =
show (11:30 pm-2:30 am) in a neighboring
 town. By the time I walked back t=
o the hostel and slept, it was 3:30 am. I had my physics exam at 8:30 am.

=
I still did well and stood first in state, with my total score in all subje=
cts being a state record then.

Can I recommend to an aspiring student to w=
atch a late night film before exam? Of course, not. In general, staying up =
late before exam is not a good strategy for most. For all we know, even MY =
score might have been higher if I hadn't done it!

*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

Now fo=
r another perspective: I am a rebel. The thrill of breaking norms, doing so=
mething unusual and putting myself at a disadvantage may have ironically ch=
arged my nervous system optimally for a great performance! Some people deli=
ver their best when pushed to a corner or sufficiently provoked/excited. Th=
us, it is even possible that it actually helped my
 performance!

*=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0 *

Bottomline: there will always be pulls and pushes from so many fo=
rces within us and judging the influence of each in isolation is difficult.=


However, generally speaking, thumb rules like "don't watch a late night m=
ovie before exam to do well", "don't eat meat to progress spiritually" are =
meaningful.

But there can always be exceptions of 2 kinds - (1) where othe=
r things compensate for one bad thing and one still does well, (2) where th=
e bad thing actually creates the optimum environment for one to do well!

Narasimha
