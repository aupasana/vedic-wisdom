Dear Rajarshi,

<<Infact
 God can very well appear before a seeker in a mul=
titude of forms and 
sometimes in a form that is seemingly infinite. Again =
God can come to a 
seeker not as a form but as a Light. Etc.>>

Different k=
inds of Light are also forms. Different kinds of Sound are also forms.

For=
m does not necessarily mean a human-like form.Form is that which has some a=
ttributes and can be described.

Yes,
 God can very well appear in a multit=
ude of forms, including human-like 
forms, light, sounds, knowledge, unders=
tanding, emotions etc. However, 
none of those forms can ever fully capture=
 the "full" potentiality of 
"God".


Best regards,
Narasimha

>THE PATH
>We
have seen a few steps towards self-realisation. Now let us d=
iscuss its
implementation. 
>=C2=A0
>Meditation
is the entry door for self-=
realisation. Normally, when we sit for meditation,
we make so many preparat=
ions, like breathing exercises, bending and stretching
exercises, etc. We b=
egin our meditation, as if God is going to appear before
us. No, God will n=
ever appear before us. As we have seen in self-realisation,
we have to real=
ise the Brahmam by destroying maya. The first step in
meditation is to ques=
tion ourselves. This is Ramana Maharishi=E2=80=99s teaching.
We have to enq=
uire =E2=80=9Cwho I am=E2=80=9D. Think about our origin, how we had come to=
 this
earth, who would have created us and why we have come to this earth. =
It is
difficult to find answers to these questions in the beginning. But wh=
en we
probe deep into our self, we will get answers one by one. Only after =
getting
answers for these questions, we can think of realizing the Brahmam.=
 During
this, we need not necessarily look into the basic aspects of medita=
tion. When
we are set to seriously think about the cause of our existence i=
n this earth,
it is only the beginning of the process of realisation. Durin=
g these initial
stages, we are neither going to drive away our thoughts, no=
r manifest anything.
Bagwan Ramakrishna Paramahamsa showed the form of Moth=
er Kali to Vivekananda.
Vivekananda did have the vision of the Mother Kali.=
 When we are talking of
Brahman as the formless, how can Bagwan Ramakrishna=
 show the divine Mother in
flesh and blood? That is because of the power of=
 manifestation of Ramakrishna
Paramahamsa. That kind of manifestation is ex=
tremely difficult for people like
us, as we have our own karmas to perform.=
 The utmost concentration is necessary
for such manifestation. 
>=C2=A0
>No=
w a
days it has become a fashion to get ourselves associated with Kundalini=
 yoga.
Except you, nobody can ever raise your kundalini energy. Even if you=
 practice
for years, self realisation through kundalini yoga is ruled out, =
as there are
no proper gurus. So, let us not be under the impression that k=
undalini yoga
will pave the way for quick self realisation. It is a misconc=
ept. Realisation cannot be achieved quickly. It will take its own time, in =
many births. 
>=C2=A0
>When
we start probing deeper and deeper into our own=
 self, we will first realise our
concern for all living beings. We will sta=
rt feeding the animals and birds with
our own hands. Then, we will start fe=
eding the poor and hungry humans. Tears
will roll down our eyes when we fee=
l and see their happiness. If we decide to
do the feeding with pomp and van=
ity, we only add our bad karmas. If we decide
to feed them through our serv=
ants, again there is no use. No doubt, their
hunger will be satisfied. But =
we will not get that everlasting happiness. This
happiness will subsequentl=
y blossom into eternal bliss. This is the first step
in realisation. We can=
not attain this stage by sitting in so called meditation
for hours together=
. The ultimate stage in meditation is that we should be
meditating perpetua=
lly. We need no separate time to meditate. Meditation will
be happening alw=
ays. So, in the initial stages of self realisation, we will
have concern fo=
r others. The concept of co-existence will be realised. This in
turn will l=
ead us to internal rejoice. We will take part in others happiness
and sorro=
w. The hatred will not be there. Eternal love will start engulfing us.
We a=
ll know that love is God. Then what next? How do we proceed further? 
>=C2=
=A0
>From
the initial level we are now going to move to the middle level.
W=
e have learnt to love others, thereby making our inner self to rejoice. Nex=
t
step is to focus our attention on some form. We should remember here that=
 Brahmam
is formless. But for the purpose of our concentration and focus, l=
et us
manifest some form of a deity, like Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had done.=
 We have
to manifest a very clear form of the deity, which is usually calle=
d =E2=80=9CIshta
Devata=E2=80=9D. We can use our imaginative power to give =
a form to this deity. For
example, the deity=E2=80=99s complexion is blue. =
He or she has four or two hands. The
crown on the head, the dress they wear=
, the weapons they hold and all such
minute details. Constant and regular m=
anifestation over a period of time will
make the deity real for us. By regu=
larly practicing this manifestation, we can
start two way communications wi=
th the deity. This is absolutely possible and
depends upon the power of our=
 sadhana (practice). Initially, we may not be able
to decipher the communic=
ation from the deity. But over a period of time, we can
understand. Since, =
the deity is created by our own manifestation; the
communication will be in=
 a language known to us. Here the frequency and
dedication are very importa=
nt. 
>Let
us understand that this is not the final stage of realisation and=
 only a middle
level. Let us also not confuse between Brahmam, which is Sup=
reme and formless
and our Ishta Devata, to whom we have given a form to our=
 liking. 
>=C2=A0
>This
middle level mainly emphasizes on sadhana. We can a=
lso set specific times in a
day to do this sadhana. At least two sessions o=
f half an hour a day is the
minimum. Two things are important. One is that =
our stomach should not be full.
Second, no disturbance during this time. 
>=
=C2=A0
>If we
are able to achieve our goals in the first and the middle sta=
ges, the third and
final stage of realizing the Brahmam will be easier. Thi=
s stage will be
discussed subsequently.
>=C2=A0
>=C2=A0
>=C2=A0
>THE
FINAL =
DESTINATION 
>=C2=A0
>After
thoroughly understanding the first two stages, =
we have to enter into the third
stage. We have already seen that Ishta Deva=
ta is important in one=E2=80=99s spiritual
progress. This Ishta Devata alon=
e will take us to the ultimate stage. Ishta
Devata is like a Guru. We will =
get instructions from Ishta Devata quite often,
when we are nearing the fin=
al stage. So what is this final stage? This is
nothing but identifying ours=
elves with Brahman, the God. We have already learnt
to identify ourselves w=
ith our Ishta Devata, to whom we have a form. But
Brahmam does not have a f=
orm. He is the cause of the creation of the Universe.
We have to identify o=
urselves with the formless, which is by no means an easy
task. 
>=C2=A0
>Th=
e
first thing in the final stage is understand the clear distinction betwee=
n the
Brahman and the maya. We have already seen that maya is surrounding t=
he Brahman
as a sheath. So, for knowing the Brahman we have to go past this=
 sheath. Maya
controls all our deeds and actions. It makes us to laugh and =
cry. But Brahman
does not act. You can know a table as table on seeing the =
table, as it has a
form. The knowing a table as a table is the work of Maya=
, the illusion. But in
the case of the Brahman, we have to realise somethin=
g that is the Supreme in
this universe which does not have a form. We have =
to visualize the form
of the formless. How do we go about it? =E2=80=9CAham=
 Brahmam asmi=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Ctat
twam asi=E2=80=9D are the two famou=
s sayings from the Vedas. Both have the same
meaning. Aham means =E2=80=98I=
 am=E2=80=99. Asmi means existing. Te literal meaning is =E2=80=9CI am
exis=
ting as Brahmam=E2=80=9D. Tat means =E2=80=98that=E2=80=99. Twam means =E2=
=80=98you=E2=80=99. Asi means existing.
The literal meaning is =E2=80=9Cyou=
 are existing as that=E2=80=9D. Here =E2=80=98that=E2=80=99 means Brahmam. =

>=C2=A0
>The
initial two stages help us here. The first stage is the unive=
rsal love, the
concern for others. The second stage is sadhana with manifes=
tation. The third and
final stage is realizing us as God. Unless somebody h=
as gone through the first
two stages meticulously, the final stage is just =
not possible. 
>=C2=A0
>Now
let us enter into the final stage. The first th=
ing in the final stage is to get
away from the attachment. The =E2=80=98I=
=E2=80=99 concept should be completely taken away from
your consciousness. =
If we have leftover ego, nothing will work for us. We must
develop the atti=
tude that God will take care of everything. We must also
understand that wh=
atever one does, that will be the will of God only. The
actions are control=
led by the God and not by the individual. If somebody hurts
us, we should t=
hink that the God has decided to hurt us at this appointed time
and the God=
 has done that act of hurting through that person. In the final
stage only =
our mind alone need to work. There should be no thoughts in our mind
other =
than the thought of the form of the formless. The absolute purity of our
mi=
nd is essential. Even a small distraction will spoil everything. That is wh=
y
during this period ancient saints went to mountains and forests just to f=
ocus
their attention on Brahman. It is extremely difficult to focus on some=
thing
that does not have a form. Only at this stage the true meditation is =
to be
practiced. For a true meditation, no particular posture is required. =
We can lie
down on the floor and meditate. The form of the Ishta Devata, ou=
r Guru should
disappear. There will me no more Guru. No more teaching. No m=
ore chanting. No
more rituals. We need to do nothing. From here on every ac=
tivity will be
different for each individual. It bill be nothing but total =
bliss; total
ananda, the Oneness. 
>=C2=A0
>Once
we follow these principles=
, the exact realisation will happen at any time and
will take only a few se=
conds. Only for these few seconds, we have to take so
many births. From the=
 moment of realisation, we will be different. We will not
be just humans. W=
e will be part of Creation. We will merge with Him. But please
understand t=
hat we can only merge with Him and not become God. God is all
alone. He doe=
s not need anybody. 
>
>From this moment onwards, we can pray for others. W=
hat ever we say will come
true. For a moment if our ego takes over, everyth=
ing will be lost. We have then
to undergo the ordeal of births after births=
. We live like others, we do
everything like others. But we are different. =
The bliss will be reflected in
our body. Body will shine. Our speech will b=
e different. We will not take
credit for anything. Now one can say =E2=80=
=9CAham Brahmam asmi=E2=80=9D. Those who realise
this become Brahman, that =
is merges with the Brahman.

<div class=3D"yiv058=

have seen a few s=
teps towards self-realisation. Now let us discuss its
implementation. </spa=
n></div>

<div class=3D"yiv0584299864MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size=

<div class=3D"yiv0584299864MsoNoSpacing"><sp=
an style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;">Meditation
is the entry door for self-realis=
ation. Normally, when we sit for meditation,
we make so many preparations, =
like breathing exercises, bending and stretching
exercises, etc. We begin o=
ur meditation, as if God is going to appear before
us. No, God will never a=
ppear before us. As we have seen in self-realisation,
we have to realise th=
e Brahmam by destroying maya. <u>The first step in
meditation is to questio=
n ourselves.</u> This is Ramana Maharishi=E2=80=99s teaching.
We have to en=
quire =E2=80=9Cwho I am=E2=80=9D. Think about our origin, how we had come t=
o this
earth, who would have created us and why we have come to this earth.=
 It is
difficult to find answers to these questions in the beginning. But w=
hen we
probe deep into our self, we will get answers one by one. Only after=
 getting
answers for these questions, we can think of realizing the Brahmam=
. During
this, we need not necessarily look into the basic aspects of medit=
ation. When
we are set to seriously think about the cause of our existence =
in this earth,
it is only the beginning of the process of realisation. Duri=
ng these initial
stages, we are neither going to drive away our thoughts, n=
or manifest anything.
Bagwan Ramakrishna Paramahamsa showed the form of Mot=
her Kali to Vivekananda.
Vivekananda did have the vision of the Mother Kali=
. When we are talking of
Brahman as the formless, how can Bagwan Ramakrishn=
a show the divine Mother in
flesh and blood? That is because of the power o=
f manifestation of Ramakrishna
Paramahamsa. That kind of manifestation is e=
xtremely difficult for people like
us, as we have our own karmas to perform=
. The utmost concentration is necessary
for such manifestation. </span></di=

<div class=3D"yiv0584299864MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0p=

<div class=3D"yiv0584299864MsoNoSpacing"><span sty=
le=3D"font-size:12.0pt;">Now a
days it has become a fashion to get ourselve=
s associated with Kundalini yoga.
Except you, nobody can ever raise your ku=
ndalini energy. Even if you practice
for years, self realisation through ku=
ndalini yoga is ruled out, as there are
no proper gurus. So, let us not be =
under the impression that kundalini yoga
will pave the way for quick self r=
ealisation. It is a misconcept. <b><u>Realisation</u></b>
cannot be achieve=
d quickly. It will take its own time, in many births. </span></div>

<div c=

</span></div>

<div class=3D"yiv0584299864MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font=
-size:12.0pt;">When
we start probing deeper and deeper into our own self, w=
e will first realise our
concern for all living beings. We will start feedi=
ng the animals and birds with
our own hands. Then, we will start feeding th=
e poor and hungry humans. Tears
will roll down our eyes when we feel and se=
e their happiness. If we decide to
do the feeding with pomp and vanity, we =
only add our bad karmas. If we decide
to feed them through our servants, ag=
ain there is no use. No doubt, their
hunger will be satisfied. But we will =
not get that everlasting happiness. This
happiness will subsequently blosso=
m into eternal bliss. This is the first step
in realisation. We cannot atta=
in this stage by sitting in so called meditation
for hours together. The ul=
timate stage in meditation is that we should be
meditating perpetually. We =
need no separate time to meditate. Meditation will
be happening always. So,=
 in the initial stages of self realisation, we will
have concern for others=
. The concept of co-existence will be realised. This in
turn will lead us t=
o internal rejoice. We will take part in others happiness
and sorrow. The h=
atred will not be there. Eternal love will start engulfing us.
We all know =
that love is God. Then what next? How do we proceed further? </span></div>

<div class=3D"yiv0584299864MsoNoSpacing"><span style=
=3D"font-size:12.0pt;">From
the initial level we are now going to move to t=
he <b><u>middle level</u></b>.
We have learnt to love others, thereby makin=
g our inner self to rejoice. Next
step is to focus our attention on some fo=
rm. We should remember here that <b><u>Brahmam
is formless</u></b>. But for=
 the purpose of our concentration and focus, let us
manifest some form of a=
 deity, like Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had done. We have
to manifest a very c=
lear form of the deity, which is usually called =E2=80=9CIshta
Devata=E2=80=
=9D. We can use our imaginative power to give a form to this deity. For
exa=
mple, the deity=E2=80=99s complexion is blue. He or she has four or two han=
ds. The
crown on the head, the dress they wear, the weapons they hold and a=
ll such
minute details. Constant and regular manifestation over a period of=
 time will
make the deity real for us. By regularly practicing this manifes=
tation, we can
start two way communications with the deity. This is absolut=
ely possible and
depends upon the power of our sadhana (practice). Initiall=
y, we may not be able
to decipher the communication from the deity. But ove=
r a period of time, we can
understand. Since, the deity is created by our o=
wn manifestation; the
communication will be in a language known to us. Here=
 the frequency and
dedication are very important. </span></div>

<div class=
=3D"yiv0584299864MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;">Let
us und=
erstand that this is not the final stage of realisation and only a middle
l=
evel. Let us also not confuse between Brahmam, which is Supreme and formles=
s
and our Ishta Devata, to whom we have given a form to our liking. </span>=
</div>

<div class=3D"yiv0584299864MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:1=

<div class=3D"yiv0584299864MsoNoSpacing"><span=
 style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;">This
middle level mainly emphasizes on sadhana=
. We can also set specific times in a
day to do this sadhana. At least two =
sessions of half an hour a day is the
minimum. Two things are important. On=
e is that our stomach should not be full.
Second, no disturbance during thi=
s time. </span></div>

yiv0584299864MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;">After
thorough=
ly understanding the first two stages, we have to enter into the third
stag=
e. We have already seen that Ishta Devata is important in one=E2=80=99s spi=
ritual
progress. This Ishta Devata alone will take us to the ultimate stage=
. Ishta
Devata is like a Guru. We will get instructions from Ishta Devata q=
uite often,
when we are nearing the final stage. So what is this final stag=
e? This is
nothing but identifying ourselves with Brahman, the God. We have=
 already learnt
to identify ourselves with our Ishta Devata, to whom we hav=
e a form. But
Brahmam does not have a form. He is the cause of the creation=
 of the Universe.
We have to identify ourselves with the formless, which is=
 by no means an easy
task. </span></div>

<div class=3D"yiv0584299864MsoNoS=

<div class=
=3D"yiv0584299864MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;">The
first =
thing in the final stage is understand the clear distinction between the
Br=
ahman and the maya. We have already seen that maya is surrounding the Brahm=
an
as a sheath. So, for knowing the Brahman we have to go past this sheath.=
 Maya
controls all our deeds and actions. It makes us to laugh and cry. But=
 Brahman
does not act. You can know a table as table on seeing the table, a=
s it has a
form. The knowing a table as a table is the work of Maya, the il=
lusion. But in
the case of the Brahman, we have to realise something that i=
s the Supreme in
this universe which does not have a form. <b><u>We have to=
 visualize the form
of the formless.</u></b> How do we go about it? =E2=80=
=9CAham Brahmam asmi=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Ctat
twam asi=E2=80=9D are the tw=
o famous sayings from the Vedas. Both have the same
meaning. Aham means =E2=
=80=98I am=E2=80=99. Asmi means existing. Te literal meaning is =E2=80=9CI =
am
existing as Brahmam=E2=80=9D. Tat means =E2=80=98that=E2=80=99. Twam mea=
ns =E2=80=98you=E2=80=99. Asi means existing.
The literal meaning is =E2=80=
=9Cyou are existing as that=E2=80=9D. Here =E2=80=98that=E2=80=99 means Bra=
hmam. </span></div>

<div class=3D"yiv0584299864MsoN=

initial two stages help us =
here. The first stage is the universal love, the
concern for others. The se=
cond stage is sadhana with manifestation. The third and
final stage is real=
izing us as God. Unless somebody has gone through the first
two stages meti=
culously, the final stage is just not possible. </span></div>

<div class=

an></div>

<div class=3D"yiv0584299864MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-siz=
e:12.0pt;">Now
let us enter into the final stage. The first thing in the fi=
nal stage is to get
away from the attachment. The =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 conce=
pt should be completely taken away from
your consciousness. If we have left=
over ego, nothing will work for us. We must
develop the attitude that God w=
ill take care of everything. We must also
understand that whatever one does=
, that will be the will of God only. The
actions are controlled by the God =
and not by the individual. If somebody hurts
us, we should think that the G=
od has decided to hurt us at this appointed time
and the God has done that =
act of hurting through that person. In the final
stage only our mind alone =
need to work. There should be no thoughts in our mind
other than the though=
t of the form of the formless. The absolute purity of our
mind is essential=
. Even a small distraction will spoil everything. That is why
during this p=
eriod ancient saints went to mountains and forests just to focus
their atte=
ntion on Brahman. It is extremely difficult to focus on something
that does=
 not have a form. Only at this stage the true meditation is to be
practiced=
. For a true meditation, no particular posture is required. We can lie
down=
 on the floor and meditate. The form of the Ishta Devata, our Guru should
d=
isappear. There will me no more Guru. No more teaching. No more chanting. N=
o
more rituals. We need to do nothing. From here on every activity will be
=
different for each individual. It bill be nothing but total bliss; total
an=
anda, the Oneness. </span></div>

<div class=3D"yiv0584299864MsoNoSpacing">=

<div class=3D"yiv058=
4299864MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;">Once
we follow these=
 principles, the exact realisation will happen at any time and
will take on=
ly a few seconds. Only for these few seconds, we have to take so
many birth=
s. From the moment of realisation, we will be different. We will not
be jus=
t humans. We will be part of Creation. We will merge with Him. But please
u=
nderstand that we can only merge with Him and not become God. God is all
al=
one. He does not need anybody. <br clear=3D"none">
<br clear=3D"none">
From=
 this moment onwards, we can pray for others. What ever we say will come
tr=
ue. For a moment if our ego takes over, everything will be lost. We have th=

to undergo the ordeal of births after births. We live like others, we do=

everything like others. But we are different. The bliss will be reflected =

our body. Body will shine. Our speech will be different. We will not tak=
