Namasthe

I would like to quote  Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharishi 's reply here to a
similar question raised by a visitor.

Regards
Madhavan


TALKS WITH RAMANA MAHARISHI

A visitor said: "One must become satiate with the fulfilment of
desires before they are renounced." Sri Bhagavan smiled and cut
in: "Fire might as well be put out by pouring spirit over the flames.
(All laugh). The more the desires are fulfilled, the deeper grows the
samskara. They must become weaker before they cease to assert
themselves. That weakness is brought about by restraining oneself
and not by losing oneself in desires.
