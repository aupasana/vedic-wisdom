Sadar Pranam,

quick questions : (please redirect - if already answered som=
ewhere)

1) can be birth be controlled ? (I know - we can think of this as
=
controlled - but as per GOD's grace may be the Kid is coming as per his /
h=
er Karma. but is there any other view point also ? can we see this as
earli=
er people use were not using any precaution while intercourse and
getting b=
abies but now they have options)

2) Pros n cons of Selective Delivery ? (i=
n case of some one who already got
direction of Cesarian baby, otherwise : =
we all know - we should be waiting
for natural pains to start)

3) which is=
 the correct Birth Time ? (when Baby's head is visible (in case
of normal d=
elivery)? or when the baby fully out of mother womb ? or when he
cries firs=
t (takes first breath) ? or when the umbilical cord cuts ?

4) Solar Eclips=
e : I know this eclipse is not visible in India (as we are
in India as of n=
ow), so does it effect anything, usually people born on
Amavasya need to do=
 remedies, but this time it will be a Amavasya and Solar
Eclipse together. =
Do we need to avoid this ?

5) the best time we got was 22 April, when Moon=
 was half (obviously
downwards) and Dhanu Lagan at 23:40 was giving  best p=
ossible combination;

6) however that has gone and now best time would be a=
fter 23:30 today where
Venus would be in Meena Rashi; but it would be closu=
re to Amavasya and
Solar Eclipse : any suggestion would be greatly apprecia=
ted.

Apologies - if this is taken as personal request, however it would be=
 good
information for the people who are in my situation now or would encou=
nter
similar in coming future.
