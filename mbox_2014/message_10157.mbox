Thanks a lot for your kind response. I have one more question. I can read s=
anskrit slokas and can understand their meaning to some exteent, but when i=
t comes to read or understand vedic text, I find it quite different. I want=
 to learn the proper way of reading and pronouncing vedic mantras (using ac=
cent marks). Could you please point me to some resources which can guide me=
 about the preliminaries/basics/foundation for it. I searched for it in the=
 internet but could not find any satisfactory resource. 

Thanks & Regards

  Dear Amit,
 There are many different "standard"
 procedures for worshippi=
ng rudra. In some procedures, the
 focus is not on the abhisheka, and the r=
udram / chamakam are
 not recited. The bodhayana shesha sutras (for those w=
ho
 learn the krishna yajur veda) have a procedure for the daily
 worship o=
f rudra (mahAdevasya aharahaH paricaryAvidhiH).
 Here, in the abhisheka por=
tion, the main mantras recited are
 the "hiranyavarniiyaa" and "pavamaana"
=
 suktas. The most common procedure for rudrAbhisheka includes
 the laghunya=
sa, followed by abhisheka with the rudra and
 chamaka mantras.=C2=A0
 
 
 N=
arasimha has included the standard
 "shodashopachara puja" in his homam man=
uals. You
 can just follow this. If you want to use more flowers, then
 you=
 can offer 108 or 1008 flowers (with the same mantra, or
 while chanting 10=
8 / 1008 names) before saying "puShpam
 samarpayAmi". If you want to do a l=
onger abhisheka,
 then you can repeat the mantra of your choice before sayi=
ng
 "snAnam samarpayAmi". No particular mantra is
 required .... re-read po=
int #3 from Narasimha's reply
 below.
 
 
 Generally speaking, it is reason=
able to expect
 trained priests who follow the krishna yajur veda to recite=

 both the rudra and chamaka. However, the rudra prashna is
 the more impor=
tant of the two. This is why we repeat only
 the rudra portion many times (=
11, 121 etc) when we do a more
 elaborate version of the rudrabhisheka. An =
even simpler way
 is to recite the "rudra sukta" which has only 6
 mantras,=
 most of which are from the rudra prashna. Or,
 simply recite the mrityunja=
ya mantra or the panchakshari.
 There are many options.
 
 
 sasneham,
 =C2=

 No=

 Is there any standard procedure for rudrabhisheka? It would
 be reall=

 procedure. Mr. P. V. R. Naras=

 If similar type of resources are crea=

 to do
 the abhishekam on their own.
