namaste,

The entire show is entertaining ... even for adults. And it has s=
ome clear
sanskrit connections .... starting from the name of the show (ava=
tAra).
Some of the characters include aapa (water) and bhuumi (earth), and =
the
fire duels are called agni-kai.

This is a cartoon with clear buddhist =
influences. However, at the end of
the day, various concepts in this show h=
ave the ability to inspire the
viewer :)

sasneham,

    ajit
