      <p>Dear Group Members,<br>
<br>
Now a days, th=
e priests are not learned enough to properly perform rudrabhisheka. I have =
seen the priests who do it just for money without any devotion, and few of =
them don't even chant 'CHAMAKAM' durng the rudrabhisheka.<br>

=
Is there any standard procedure for rudrabhisheka? It would be really great=
 if some one points me to the correct procedure. Mr. P. V. R. Narasimha Rao=
 has done a great service by providing simplified homam procedure on his we=
bsite <a href=3D"http://vedivastrologer.org" target=3D"_blank">vedivastrolo=
ger.org</a>. If similar type of resources are created for rudrabhisheka, it=
 will be a great help for people like me who want to do the abhishekam on t=
heir own.<br>

<br>
Thanks & Regards<br>

 It is on Feb 27 Thursday nig=

 Magha Krishna Chaturdasi is active. The middle of=

 ANY deity to understand their qualities and absorb some of<br>

 I have a few questions<br>
 regarding Maha Sh=

 -<br>
  <br>
 1) Is Maha Shiva Ratri for<br>
 India an=

 25th Feb?<br>
  <br>
 2) What is the best time<b=

 for prayers in Maha Shiva <br>
 Ratri? Is it recommended to pray all ni=
ght? As early evening<br>
 / dusk is the best <br>
 time for prayers / japa=
m in general, and some say that<br>
 Around midnight (12 AM) <br>
 it is th=
e time of Kali and so prayers / japam should not be<br>
 done. Would like t=

  <br>
 3) Any special advices<br=
