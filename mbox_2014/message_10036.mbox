Hi,

I had also raised doubt about same thing but didn't got  any ans. Afte=
r
thinking I reached to following conclusion where both can be used.

1. Wh=
en you follow South =96 West =96 North =96 East. you will see that power
ge=
ts concentrated on Eshan (North-East) corner.  In thing pattern you can
hav=
e Kalash filled with water in begging oh hommam in (North -East) where
powe=
r is concentrated. and you can drink this water or can use as blessed
water=
 for sick person. You may put Tulsi dal , Bilwa or  rose petal,
cardemam , =
Rudraksh in this kalash as per requirement.

2. In other pattern EAST -  WE=
ST - NORTH - and finally all round stating
from South. you will see Pattern=
 of Swastika been formed and then it is
rotated. This is  to create and cal=
l energy ( YAD BHADRAN TANA ASUV) so the
surrounding is energized with good=
.

Open for critics and comments.
