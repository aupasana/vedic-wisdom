Namaste.

Thanks for your clarification. I think because of your high spiri=
tual position, devotion is enough. While for common people like me, pronunc=
iation matters. (You have opined the same, saying it may be needed in the b=
eginning.) Personally I have found correct pronunciation to be very importa=
nt, and even it happened that I adopted a pronunciation out of my experienc=
e and later came to know it being correct gramatically!

I also feel that i=
t is a will of the divinity that you will share the correctness of Sanskrit=
 (among other wisdom) and that is why the divinity gives you insights about=
 it.

I have got two questions -

1) As you said -

"It is "sin(g)ha" with =
g silent."

I guess it will pronounce exactly like English words king, sing=
, ring, ping etc., am I correct here?

2) A question about Ganapati Atharva=
 Shirsham. In the end of the para where Ganapati is praised as Brahma, Vish=
nu, Rudra, Indra etc., it ends with -

"... tvam brahma bhur-bhuvas-suvarom=
"

All other sources I came across says 'svarom' instead of 'suvarom'. I su=
ppose it talks about the three worlds bhuh, bhuvah and suvah; and this thir=
d one in other sources are being mentioned as 'svah' instead of 'suvah'. In=
teresting to note that in the Gayatri mantras available on the net it is me=
ntioned as either suvah / svah (variations). However I learned the Gayatri =
in the past as 'svah'.

But you have chosen 'suvah' (not 'svah') and even i=
n the homam manual, while lighting the fire, and even purifying fire with e=
igth drops of ghee, you have always chosen 'suvah'.

So I am sure that ther=
e must be a definite reason that you prefer 'suvah' and not 'svah'. Could y=
ou please explain the reason a bit. Also, if 'suvah' is correct, shall we a=
lso use it in the Gayatri mantra?

Thanks
Tanvir

  Namaste,

  Your keen obse=
rvation is impressive!



  Yes, that anusvara is pronounced by most schola=
rs as "gum" or "gam". But, given that it is supposed to be just a nasal sou=
nd, I am not convinced by the explicit occurrence of the consonant "g". IMH=
O, it is definitely a Kali yuga corruption.

  *        *        *

  This =
one is tricky. But there are more common sounds, e.g. vowel ai as in "aim" =
beeja and "aindri" word, vowel ru/ri as in "rushi" or "rishi", hanging cons=
onant "t" at the end of "prachodayaat" etc. Most people do not pronounce th=
ese correctly. These occur in simple words, as opposed to this anuswara whi=
ch occurs in complex Veda mantras only. There are several such things where=
 no single region of India got it right. Different parts of India are corre=
ct in different things.

  Fortunately, the correct pronunciation of all th=
ese sounds is confidently and accurately derivable based on grammar rules e=
tc, if only one applies oneself and thinks straight. Over the years, I have=
 identified several of these, convinced myself 100% on each (except the anu=
swara where I am not 100% sure) and switched my pronunciation accordingly.
=

  However, now I am 100% convinced that pronunciation is only 1% of the th=
ing and devotion and sincerity are far more important, though correct pronu=
nciation may be initially useful.

  So I am not that motivated to correct =
people's pronunciation. But, given that several insights came to me on this=
 over the years, it is probably one of my dharmas to share them with the wo=
rld before I leave. I will try to do it soon. I thought of making a youtube=
 video on "pronunciation of tricky Sanskrit sounds" many years ago (showing=
 my face and a white board). Perhaps time has come to just do it.



  *   =
     *        *

  Coming back to this anuswara:

  Bindu before p, ph, b, =
bh is pronounced as one nasal (m); bindu before t, th, d, dh is pronounced =
as another nasal (n); bindu before k, kh, g, gh is pronounced as another na=
sal; bindu before ch, chh, j, jh is pronounced as another nasal, etc.

  My=
 take is that bindu before y, r, l, v, sh, Sh, s, h is to be pronounced as =
the first one again, i.e. as the nasal before k, kh, g, gh.

  Take the man=
tra "tanno nArasi{M}haH prachodayAt", where {M} is this anuswara. A lot of =
scholars pronounce this as "tanno nArasiguMhaH prachodayAt". IMHO, that is =
way off and has an extra syllable. You are better off just pronouncing it a=
s "tanno nArasimhaH prachodayAt", i.e. pronounce {M} as "m" or the nasal be=
fore p, ph, b, bh.

  But better IMHO is to pronounce it as the nasal befor=
e g. Start off as though you are saying "tanno nArasinghaH prachodayAt", su=
ppress "g" when about to say it, and jump directly to "h". That is what I d=
o. This allows you to pronounce the correct nasal. Unless we are about to s=
ay, k, kh, g or gh, we can't say that nasal. Of course, in some languages (=
e.g. Vietnamese), that nasal occurs independently and those people can pron=
ounce it well.

  BTW, if you end up letting out a bit of "g" instead of su=
ppressing it completely and jumping to "h", then you end up getting "singha=
", which is another common corruption of "si{M}ha".

  To put it simply: Th=
e correct pronunciation is neither "sinha" nor "simha" nor "singha". It is =
"sin(g)ha" with g silent.

  Best regards,
  Narasimha

    Namaste Narasimha ji and others.

    Recently while reading =
Rudra-Prashna I came across an uncommon anusvara. With some studies from th=
e net I learnt that it is called 'agamanusvara' and occurs commonly in Yaju=
r-veda.

    The technical files I studied on the net keep it impossible fo=
r me to comprehend what it actually sounds and how to pronounce it. In most=
 audios of Rudram available on the net it is uttered as 'gm' or 'g(u)m' whi=
ch do not convince me, because it is an anuswara by definition.

    Later =
I remembered coming across this anusvara in Ganapati-Atharvashirsham (saMhi=
ta-sandhih), I listened to your (Narasimha ji's) two audios on it, both ins=
tances you had uttered it as 'sang-hita' (with a nasal tone), where the 'sa=
ng' sounds like English words ping, sing, ring, king etc. 

    I just am a=
sking it to make sure that my understanding is correct about the pronunciat=
ion of it? Kindly confirm.

    Thanks
    Tanvir
