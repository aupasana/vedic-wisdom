Namaste Ashish Ji

I am no one to give an official advice but from my perso=
nal experience, it is good to keep the lingam in your house in some respect=
ed place (puja-corner etc.) and not casually in your bedroom. you can simpl=
y put some flower petals on it in the mornings or evenings, or pour pure mi=
lk or water over it while chanting Shiva mantras.

Regards
Tanvir

  Respected members of the group

  I have two shiv lings one ma=
de of stone and the other made of glass in my house purchased by the member=
s of my family, people says that one should not keep shiv lings in house if=
 he/she can't perform puja  daily otherwise negative energy comes in to hou=
se. None of my family is able to do abhishek or puja of these shiv lings. I=
 don't know what to do of these lings. 

  Should i do visarjan of them or =
give it away? Please give your valuable advice on this.

  Regards
  Ashish=
