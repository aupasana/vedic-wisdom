Respected Gurujan,

As you might have already noticed that Navratra is beginning from 25th
Sept,2014, as per most of the calendars in India. However, Pratipada is
beginning from 24th Sept, 2014, 11:30 AM itself.

So I was planning to fast and homam from 24th Sept itself.

What is your opinion in this regard ?

Regards
Durgesh O Mishra
