Namaste,
Do deities exist as beings separate from us? Yes.
Do deities exist=
 in us as aspects of our own consciousness? Yes.
What then is the link betw=
een the two? Let us step down to something more earthy to understand this b=
etter.

*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *

When I write or sa=
y something, does everyone understand the same way? Of course not. One may =
think that I am denying God's existence. One may think that I am asking to =
completely surrender to God.

One may think I am confused and not making an=
y sense. One may think that I am wise and clarifying subtle concepts. One m=
ay think that I am a proud person spreading half-baked knowledge. Different=
 people may look at me differently and judge/understand my actions, my word=
s, their meanings and their motivation differently. Sometimes, totally diff=
erently. We see such things all the time in life, don't we?

Why does it ha=
ppen?

*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *

When one reads or l=
istens to me, one's mind is aware of some letters or sounds or facial/tonal=
 expressions, etc. These objective sensory perceptions are subjectively int=
erpreted by a mind using its own conditioning. We add meaning to objective =
sensory experiences by consciously or sub-consciously falling back on lesso=
ns from all experiences in this life and previous lives (which are stored i=
n chitta as sub-conscious memories and tendencies).

Of course, I am not sa=
ying that what I write/say does not matter. It matters too. But it is just =
one input. The other person's mental conditioning and life experiences are =
the other input. Both inputs together form an impression in the other perso=
n's mind. Effectively, this creates a character called "Narasimha Rao" in t=
hat person's mind. Whatever that person thinks of me, favorably or unfavora=
bly, is actually about that character in his own mind and not about me! Sim=
ilarly, whatever that person learns/understands from my writings is actuall=
y from that character in his own mind and not from me. After all, not every=
one develops the same understanding by reading what I write.

Of course, as=
 one interacts with me more and more, that character in one's own mind may =
resonate with me more and more and get closer to the "real me". But it may =
never really become identical to the real me.


*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *

This applies to deities too.

Whether one reads about=
 a deity and thinks of the deity, whether one actually had a vision or a dr=
eam of the deity, the bottomline is that all that creates a character in on=
e's mind called that deity!!! Whatever one perceives of that deity is of th=
at character in one's mind and not of the "real deity". Whatever one learns=
 or receives from is from that character in one's mind and not from the rea=
l deity.

The reason is one's own conditioning, which has a fundamental rol=
e in interpreting, or even constructing, every experience. It affects one's=
 awareness, understanding and interaction with a deity too. Whatever one is=
 aware of, understands and interacts with, is basically through characters =
constructed and sustained in one's own consciousness, whether of people lik=
e me or deities. As long as there is dense conditioning, it does affect one=
's experiences. What I say or a deity does is one input, and one's conditio=
ning is the second input. Both together determine what the character in one=
's mind, corresponding to me or a deity, says/does.

*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *

If you wants to understand me better, overcome y=
our conditioning - make it lighter and lighter. Spend more time with me. Le=
t the "Narasimha Rao" in your mind become a closer reflection of me.

Simil=
arly, if you want to benefit from a deity, overcome your conditioning - mak=
e it lighter and lighter. Spend more time thinking of the deity. Let the de=
ity's conception in your consciousness become a closer reflection of the de=
ity.

*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *

This is why self-con=
trol, reduction of conditioning (vasanas) and internal transformation is vi=
tal for progress. Without it, one with dense conditioning will not make pro=
gress even if he sits next to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa everyday or Lord Shiv=
a appears before him everyday.

Best regards,
Narasimha
