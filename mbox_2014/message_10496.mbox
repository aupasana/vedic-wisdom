Namaste Narasimha ji and everyone.

I have a confusion regarding the pronun=
ciation of V after consonants. I tried to solve the confusion through net, =
but did not succeed.

Mostly, V after consonants sounds W.

Examples
vishva=
 =3D vishwa
ishvara =3D ishwara
svaahaa =3D swaahaa
dhvajaa =3D dhwajaa
tat=
tva =3D tattwa
Etc.

However, someone told me that after ya, ra, la, V stil=
l sounds as V, and not as W.

Examples
sarva =3D sarva
bilva =3D bilva
Etc.=


Few days back in a mantra I uttered "rinad-vimuchyeta" with V, because I =
felt if I change V to W here, the word "vimochona" does not remain. But utt=
ering it with V gave me very umcomfortable results, and so I started utteri=
ng "rinadwi-muchyeta", which actually shows the validity of the above rule =
(V sounding W) and gave me good result.

Recently while chanting Ganesha's =
1000 Names, I found a word in it's kara-nyasa, which is like

brahmANDa-kum=
bhashchidvyometi

It puts V after 'd' (...chidvyo...) so following the abov=
e experience, I said it as "...chidyo.." (Using W-sound instead of V) and i=
t gave me bad results, which can't be explained by the rule that V after ev=
ery consonants (Except ya, ra, la) sounds W. So I had to break the rule and=
 say it with V (...chidvyo..) and the reult was good again.

My question is=
 that, is my observation and understanding correct? Why V sounding W-sound =
did not apply here, and gave me bad results? What am I missing?

Also, I go=
t the following words while chanting Brihaspati's 108 Names, should I say V=
 or W in them?

1. vAgvichakShaNaH (V after g)
2. sampadvibhAsuraH (V after=
 d)
3. sarvApadvinivArakaH (V after d)
4. R^igvedapArago (V after g)
5. ved=
AntavidvaraH (V after d)
6. lokavashaMvadaH (V after anusvara / M-sound)
7.=
 surasainyAnAMvipatChidrAnaketave (V after anusvara / M-sound)
8. kAlaR^igv=
ettA (V after g, same as # 4)

In # 4, if we follow the rule, we have to sa=
y "rigweda" and not "rig-veda"... though we say the latter, but the rule sa=
ys we may be should say "rig-weda" ??

Similarly, there is a word in Ganesh=
a 1000 Nama Stotram -

pa~nchAshadviShNu (V after d)

Here if we follow the=
 rule and say W instead of V, Lord Vishnu's name changes to Wishnu... so wh=
at should be uttered?

Thanks
Tanvir
