Namaste everyone.

I have read in wikipedia that different anuvakas of Rudr=
aprashna are chanted for different general purposes. Such as, the 7th anuva=
ka is for getting progeny and education, the 8th anuvaka is chanted for the=
 destruction of enemies. Do you know of such traditions and beliefs? If so,=
 please share some details.

Thanks
Tanvir
