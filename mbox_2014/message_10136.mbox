Dear All ,

Not sure if this question is already asked in the forum

I just relocated to USA and have a time difference of about 13.5 hours with
India timezone.

My question is say for Maha Shivaratri what date/time should we follow ,
will it be India time or current timezone . As per India time it has
started , but if we follow US time it will not start until tomorrow.

Please advise.

Thanks and Regards
Rohit
