small question - small answer

The whole world is the body of GOD, so if something happens at finger or at
foot or even at this Body's hair will be by GOD's will only. Some time old
skin goes away and new comes, some time scratch, some time wound - it is
all natural, same as it happens to your body.

Respected Gurus - Please add / modify.

Regards, Sanjay
