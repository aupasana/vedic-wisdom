Hello All,

Here is my take-away from all the answers.

1) There is no expl=
icit prohibition (Nishiddha).
   The reason behind such statement is in a c=
aution and/or advice sense. My concern was not initiate unanticipated resul=
ts. I don't want to sit down with a lingering doubt/apprehension.
   
2) If=
 one practices this for deep concentration regularly for long, say an year =
or more,as a side effect, there is some scope of developing disenchantment =
and disinterest in worldly and family affairs leading to neglect/ignore Gri=
hasta dharma duties. This seems to be the most likely reason for such a sta=
tement.
As a Gruhasta, upaasana of a diety's mantra with devotion will even=
tually take one to a state where pure Omkara upaasana can begin with confid=
ence.
   
3) If you are lucky enough to have a Guru and following him/her,
=
   and explicitly advised not to do , follow Guru's instructions.
   Guru s=
peaks based on either scriptures, parampara/tradition or the
   disciple's =
current state of being. 
   It is like a toddler graduating from triCycle t=
o biCycle. 
   A Guru, like father, will let you practice triCycle until yo=
u are matured enough for biCycle.

I am not changing/forming/altering any o=
pinion on the said Pravachan karta based on this alone. Society gets immens=
e intangible benefits with sincere scholar's preaching. At the least, they =
keep the belief in karma alive in our Conscience and make us spend a little=

less time on meaningless, mind-polluting trash churned out by TV and Movie=
 media 24X7.

BTW, I have one more reason for asking this question at this =
time.
I have also read in a small article recently that Lord Siva has said
=
Omkaara upaasana on a Ardra+Chaturdasi day is extremely effective and
gives=
 multiplied result ( reference - Siva Purana/Vidyeyswara S /chapter 10). La=
zy and Greedy me would like spend a few moments doing this on this Tuesday,=
 Jan 14. Hope this info is correct and all readers here will benefit by spe=
nding a few minutes on this upaasana on Tuesday.

Thank you all, especially=
 for Narasimaha ji, for your feedback and detailed explanations.


regards,=

Ramesh
