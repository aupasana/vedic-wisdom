Namaste,
 There are various methods but here is one of them (which worked for me)

 * When going to sleep start repeating mentally "I want to leave my body". 
 * After some nights, you are going to wake up in a "paralyzed" (not being able to move) state 
 and you will hear what sounds like an airplane. It is very important that you are not afraid at this point.
 If you become afraid you will just fall back sleep. During this state you might feel like
 someone or something is watching you from the "side". Depending on the makeup of you
 mind, you also might visuallize various things. Again do not be afraid. First
 couple of times you will probably get scared but afterwards you will get used to it.
 * During this paralyzed state is when you can pull your astral body out of your physical body. There
 are a couple of way this can be done.
 1) Mentally pretend you are pulling yourself up a rope which is handing from ceiling.
 2) Mentally pretend there is a red "X" on the floor beside your bed. After visualizing the "X",
 visualize a person sitting on it and finally try to visualize/believe that that person is
 you. This is the method that worked for me.

 Enjoy :)
