Dear gurus,
while chanting mantras or doing poojas what we should visualise=
 from our mind, apart from pure bhakti? How do the mantras affect on our da=
y today life? How do we feel that aura?

      Dear gurus,

It may be a childish to=
 ask such a question. It may be personal, official or health problems. Some=
 people may suggest to do some poojas, Homams, how to overcome the problems=
 of life? Is kaliyuga like that only? When our problems ll end? What might =
be the reason for this misery? When the whole world become spiritual base? =
When do we find joyous people?
