Dear Gurujis 

I am always confronted with the a little dilemma.=A0 There a=
re lot of people who want to go on spiritual path and do some karma like ho=
mam,=A0 praying regularly as should be done, doing vratam etc.=A0 What I he=
ar from learned people is that marriage is a dharma which should be used by=
 couple to go on spiritual path.=A0 

But now a days,=A0 we don't see that =
either husband/wife do not co-operate with other to go on the right path (d=
harma) as said by Vedas.=A0 In such a case,=A0 I am sure their married life=
 would be no good,=A0 which in turn will not be a good family,=A0 which in =
turn affects society and mankind as a whole.=A0 May be this how kali yuga i=
s supposed to be.... 

In this context,=A0 what should one do to be on righ=
t spiritual path even if they do not get support from wife/husband. I don't=
 think that getting divorced or taking sanyasa will help, I heard of Hindu =
purana story of Gautama maharishi who corrects his wife and then accepts he=
r - but do not leave her because of the mistake she did. So I have a lot of=
 respect for our Vedas and purana which never advises about divorce. But in=
 kali yuga, people don't have the strengths of rishis to overcome obstacles=
. 

Please let me know how one should go about this dilemma to gain strengt=
h to continue on spiritual path in spite of no support from better half. 

=
Regards 
Srinivas
