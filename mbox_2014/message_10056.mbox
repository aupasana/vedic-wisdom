There is no overall concept in karma and reincarnation. For each and every =
good deed and also for each and every evil deed one performs physically, me=
ntally  or emotionally or through utterance, the resulting experiencing as =
a reward or punishment happens. It is only the time gap between doing and h=
appening, which may be at once, a few hours, days, Years, decades or even i=
ncarnations. Happening Is on ripening and the happening is only for purific=
ation or fulfillment.
So it is not like a bank closure statement for a fina=
ncial year. Rest you will understand. With best regards.
