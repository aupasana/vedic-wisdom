a simple thought experiment......if we have an apple and an orange in front
of us and must decide to pick either 1 up.
what really happens in our minds?..after all the thought processes...and
deliberations?....why 1 or the other?..who or what is it that actually
decides?...for me the actual moment of action seems spontaneous.....

like it simply happens on its own!.....so honestly i cant seem to figure
out if there is any will...or even if there is "someone"..or :something"
there to begin with...let alone be free....weird is all i can
say!.....sorry,..it's one of life's imponderables!

i did read something about this issue in the yoga vasistha a long time
back,but forgot....can someone here who is well versed with that book
kindly explain what the text says about this....thanks.
