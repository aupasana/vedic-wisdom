Namasttay Everyone,

 

1.       What a beautiful explanation! Though these lines of appreciations
do not add much inputs to the thread, yet I could not resist sharing and
expressing the joy emanating from my heart after going through this
wonderful explanation full of compassion. Who else can shower compassion
other than a true Guru who is verily the embodiment of The Mother!

2.       To have a razor-sharp analytical incision is a splendid blessings,
un-shaded by the clouds of emotions.

3.       Blessed is this group, and blessed is one who reads the
compassionate explanation by Shri Narasimha Ji. This will verily clear many
clouds of sanshaya(indecisions) clogging the mind.

 

With Indebtedness,

And Kind Regards,

Kannan

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] External vs Internal Deities (Re: Clash of
desires/sankalpas)

 

  

Namaste,

 

Do deities exist as beings separate from us? Yes.

Do deities exist in us as aspects of our own consciousness? Yes.


What then is the link between the two? Let us step down to something more
earthy to understand this better.

*        *        *

When I write or say something, does everyone understand the same way? Of
course not. One may think that I am denying God's existence. One may think
that I am asking to completely surrender to God.

One may think I am confused and not making any sense. One may think that I
am wise and clarifying subtle concepts. One may think that I am a proud
person spreading half-baked knowledge. Different people may look at me
differently and judge/understand my actions, my words, their meanings and
their motivation differently. Sometimes, totally differently. We see such
things all the time in life, don't we?

Why does it happen?

*        *        *

When one reads or listens to me, one's mind is aware of some letters or
sounds or facial/tonal expressions, etc. These objective sensory perceptions
are subjectively interpreted by a mind using its own conditioning. We add
meaning to objective sensory experiences by consciously or sub-consciously
falling back on lessons from all experiences in this life and previous lives
(which are stored in chitta as sub-conscious memories and tendencies).

Of course, I am not saying that what I write/say does not matter. It matters
too. But it is just one input. The other person's mental conditioning and
life experiences are the other input. Both inputs together form an
impression in the other person's mind. Effectively, this creates a character
called "Narasimha Rao" in that person's mind. Whatever that person thinks of
me, favorably or unfavorably, is actually about that character in his own
mind and not about me! Similarly, whatever that person learns/understands
from my writings is actually from that character in his own mind and not
from me. After all, not everyone develops the same understanding by reading
what I write.

Of course, as one interacts with me more and more, that character in one's
own mind may resonate with me more and more and get closer to the "real me".
But it may never really become identical to the real me.

 

*        *        *

This applies to deities too.

Whether one reads about a deity and thinks of the deity, whether one
actually had a vision or a dream of the deity, the bottomline is that all
that creates a character in one's mind called that deity!!! Whatever one
perceives of that deity is of that character in one's mind and not of the
"real deity". Whatever one learns or receives from is from that character in
one's mind and not from the real deity.

The reason is one's own conditioning, which has a fundamental role in
interpreting, or even constructing, every experience. It affects one's
awareness, understanding and interaction with a deity too. Whatever one is
aware of, understands and interacts with, is basically through characters
constructed and sustained in one's own consciousness, whether of people like
me or deities. As long as there is dense conditioning, it does affect one's
experiences. What I say or a deity does is one input, and one's conditioning
is the second input. Both together determine what the character in one's
mind, corresponding to me or a deity, says/does.

*        *        *

If you wants to understand me better, overcome your conditioning - make it
lighter and lighter. Spend more time with me. Let the "Narasimha Rao" in
your mind become a closer reflection of me.

Similarly, if you want to benefit from a deity, overcome your conditioning -
make it lighter and lighter. Spend more time thinking of the deity. Let the
deity's conception in your consciousness become a closer reflection of the
deity.

*        *        *

This is why self-control, reduction of conditioning (vasanas) and internal
transformation is vital for progress. Without it, one with dense
conditioning will not make progress even if he sits next to Ramakrishna
Paramahamsa everyday or Lord Shiva appears before him everyday.

Best regards,
Narasimha

I am trying to understand POV of Shri Narsimhaji  and if i am going right
then my conclusion is that there is no existence of God in other word its
all about great qualities that people worshiping in the disguise of god.
There is no god who can do miracle over night but the perception that
changes overnight in the reaction of a major action. Dashavatars of shri
hari Vishnu never actually happened on the earth they are teachings in the
form of symbolic stories.

>From my observation and experiences i am summing up that
True god is within us, its our soul. pure thoughts good behavior is god.
Karma done by such thoughts and behavior  in most adverse circumstances
leads toward moksh.
Moksh is defined as merger of soul with god nd end of karma but if you are
able to do good karma in any situation you achieve the level of god, ability
of god.

Ability of god is infinite so god can do anything thus moksha is not end of
karma but ability of God.

Please correct me if I am wrong

kind regards
Ashish

Subject: Clash of desires/sankalpas

 

Namaste friends,

 

Best wishes for Maha Shiva Ratri on Thursday night!

 

A friend read Dr Svoboda's "Greatness of Saturn", in which it was mentioned
that reading Saturn's story would give some relief from Saturn problems.
That person wondered if just reading stories or prayers can give benefit and
noted that several of that person's sankalpas were not getting fulfilled
despite sincere sadhana.

 

I want to share my reply here, as it may help others.

 

*        *        *

 

Associating actions with fruits is not easy, especially when the pipeline of
actions is deep and contains contradictory actions, undertaken with
contradictory sankalpas - spoken/unspoken.

Nature carries various souls to the final goal of Freedom, thru various
paths. Nature considers all the desires a soul entertained in the past,
assesses the momentum they are carrying though their karmas and finds the
best path through which those desires either get fulfilled or stand the best
chance. Nature puts one on such a path. As one traverses the path, however,
one may entertain new desires and that may force Nature to re-adjust things
again. Until one overcomes all desires, Nature keeps re-adjusting one's
path.

If a sankalpa of yours is not getting fulfilled, there are 2 possibilities:
(1) there isn't enough force behind that sankalpa or associated action, (2)
this sankalpa is at loggerheads with another sankalpa from the past that has
too much momentum going for it already!

 

I may wish for liberation in one moment and for fame in another. The chain
reaction of fruits set in motion by the 2 sankalpas may be at loggerheads.

*        *        *

 

Rituals do work for some simple people. I know of 5 cases in which people
out of job (for months in 2 cases) sat through my monthly Full Moon Satya
Narayana vratam and got a job within 2 weeks.

Of course, this is not my doing. For all you know, those people may have a
high level of surrender to god and faith that the ritual may help them and
they may get a result, even though my own faith may be weak and does nothing
for me!!! In other words, one actually performing the ritual may not see any
benefit, but one attending it may! Thus, my pooja is just a proxy or
external symbol that merely helps them connect to god within their own
consciousness, who is the actual giver of things!


Of course, even if my own faith is strong, what I want may be more difficult
(e.g. liberation). So it may seem like I am not getting any result (because
I am making slow progress on a long path). Or I may want something simple,
but it may not be granted as it is against something else I asked for before
(and which is on its way already).

*        *        *

 

For some people who are sufficiently evolved spiritually and have a strong
momentum towards liberation already in place, fulfilling some mundane
desires may be difficult, except when they do not mess with pre-existing
momentum towards liberation. Otherwise, no amount of sadhana may really be
sufficient..

 

*        *        *

 

Just one word of common sense. Shani maharaj (or any other deity) is not a
self-centered person who becomes happy when people praise him or talk about
him. Contemplating the greatness or qualities of Saturn or other deities
(who are personifications of beneficial aspects of our own consciousness)
enhances those aspects of our consciousness by resonance. After all, what
your mind contemplates, you tend to absorb some of those qualities over
time.

Best regards,

Narasimha

What then is the link between the two? Let=
 us step down to something more
earthy to understand this better.<br>
<br>
=
*       
*     =
   *<br>
<br>
When I write or say something, does everyone unders=
tand the same way? Of course
not. One may think that I am denying God's exi=
stence. One may think that I am
asking to completely surrender to God.<br>
=
<br>
One may think I am confused and not making any sense. One may think th=
at I am
wise and clarifying subtle concepts. One may think that I am a prou=
d person
spreading half-baked knowledge. Different people may look at me di=
fferently and
judge/understand my actions, my words, their meanings and the=
ir motivation differently.
Sometimes, totally differently. We see such thin=
gs all the time in life, don't
we?<br>
<br>
Why does it happen?<br>
<br>
*&=
nbsp;      
*     &n=
bsp;  *<br>
<br>
When one reads or listens to me, one's mind is aware =
of some letters or sounds
or facial/tonal expressions, etc. These objective=
 sensory perceptions are
subjectively interpreted by a mind using its own c=
onditioning. We add meaning
to objective sensory experiences by consciously=
 or sub-consciously falling back
on lessons from all experiences in this li=
fe and previous lives (which are
stored in chitta as sub-conscious memories=
 and tendencies).<br>
<br>
Of course, I am not saying that what I write/say=
 does not matter. It matters
too. But it is just one input. The other perso=
n's mental conditioning and life
experiences are the other input. Both inpu=
ts together form an impression in the
other person's mind. Effectively, thi=
s creates a character called
"Narasimha Rao" in that person's min=
d. Whatever that person thinks of
me, favorably or unfavorably, is actually=
 about that character in his own mind
and not about me! Similarly, whatever=
 that person learns/understands from my
writings is actually from that char=
acter in his own mind and not from me. After
all, not everyone develops the=
 same understanding by reading what I write.<br>
<br>
Of course, as one int=
eracts with me more and more, that character in one's own
mind may resonate=
 with me more and more and get closer to the "real
me". But it ma=
y never really become identical to the real me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

nbsp;      *<br>
<br>
This applies to deities too.=
<br>
<br>
Whether one reads about a deity and thinks of the deity, whether =
one actually
had a vision or a dream of the deity, the bottomline is that a=
ll that creates a
character in one's mind called that deity!!! Whatever one=
 perceives of that
deity is of that character in one's mind and not of the =
"real deity".
Whatever one learns or receives from is from that c=
haracter in one's mind and
not from the real deity.<br>
<br>
The reason is =
one's own conditioning, which has a fundamental role in
interpreting, or ev=
en constructing, every experience. It affects one's
awareness, understandin=
g and interaction with a deity too. Whatever one is
aware of, understands a=
nd interacts with, is basically through characters
constructed and sustaine=
d in one's own consciousness, whether of people like me
or deities. As long=
 as there is dense conditioning, it does affect one's
experiences. What I s=
ay or a deity does is one input, and one's conditioning is
the second input=
. Both together determine what the character in one's mind,
corresponding t=
o me or a deity, says/does.<br>
<br>
*      &=
nbsp;
*        *<br>
<br>
If you wants t=
o understand me better, overcome your conditioning - make it
lighter and li=
ghter. Spend more time with me. Let the "Narasimha Rao"
in your m=
ind become a closer reflection of me.<br>
<br>
Similarly, if you want to be=
nefit from a deity, overcome your conditioning -
make it lighter and lighte=
r. Spend more time thinking of the deity. Let the
deity's conception in you=
r consciousness become a closer reflection of the
deity.<br>
<br>
* &n=
bsp;     
*      &nb=
sp; *<br>
<br>
This is why self-control, reduction of conditioning (vasanas=
) and internal
transformation is vital for progress. Without it, one with d=
ense conditioning
will not make progress even if he sits next to Ramakrishn=
a Paramahamsa everyday
or Lord Shiva appears before him everyday.<br>
