 Interesting conversation!

A few years ago I was having a similar conver=
sation with another gentleman - a geneticist - on chromosomes and was keen =
to understand why this method of transferring of female gotra to males post=
 marriage was put in place. There are two things a) the change of gotra of =
women after marriage b) restriction of marriage within the gotra.

But befo=
re all this we must explore how did the present system of marriage come int=
o place. From a Rishi named Swetaketu who made the rule that one man (leavi=
ng kings aside) would marry one woman and they would be a couple for life. =
Before the time of Swetaketu things were laissez faire, with no concept of =
a binding contract as a marriage the way we define it today. Offsprings and=
 their upbringing was taken care of by women. Society looked at things quit=
e differently than we do today. Naturally in such a setting it maybe unlike=
ly that such a gotra system existed, or if they did, it could have probably=
 meant a spiritual group rather than a physical classification of lineage.
=

Now if it is a spiritual group, that is, the people who are linked by the =
knowledge they gained from one of teh root gotra rishis, then we have anoth=
er example of such a spiritual group that came into existence from the Tant=
ras. They called it the KulA, the lineage of the disciples of a particular =
Kaula who are linked by the common thread of knowledge and development. Why=
 did the Tantras develop the system of Kaula? Possibly because by the time =
of the KaliYuga we were so far off from the time of the Rishis that the spe=
cific effects of the knwoledge, passed on from the Rishi to his group had b=
ecome extremely weak. I am sure the knowledge of the Rishis are still there=
 but most did not have the ability to truthfully access them anymore, and n=
ame of the gotra rishis merely became a part of tradition less understood a=
nd limited only to practical usage during marriage ceremonies.

The second =
scenario would be that at some point for some reason - before the start of =
the Kali Sandhya  and Mahabharata - for some reasons various knowledge syst=
ems were diluted and/or depopulated and then these root Rishis were asked t=
o start their physical lineages, giving them their names, since Rishis were=
 the purest of beings. If that is the case, even then, the gap between that=
 time and today is so vast  and so many millions of generations have passed=
 that the specific physical influence that is created by the energy of the =
Rishis being transmited also got lost and muddied. The idea of no marriage =
inside a gotra has become of no practical biological significance at all, e=
xcept for its traditional value. 

So eventually the idea of the gotra beca=
me relevant in transmission of a patriarchal marriage system, once marriage=
s become the norm. Why patriarchy? There could be many simultaneous reasons=
 for this but one of them was that it was easier to keep track of the immed=
iate parentage in such a child. For the same reason polygamy was allowed bu=
t polyandry frowned upon and generally discouraged. In a polyandrous system=
 it is difficult to know the exact parents of a child, which is not the cas=
e in a polygamous arrangement. Of course there were other socio-cultural re=
asons for this too, not all of which maybe beyond questions or with a great=
er aim in sight. But that is the another discussion.

All these are my opin=
ions, feel free to disagree. Each one has to find his own resolution of suc=
h things. Having said that worship of Rishis - any Rishis of gotra or no go=
tra - can be seriously beneficial. It takes time, it works slowly - they ra=
rely ever appear so easily - but their grace causes sure effects over large=
 periods of time if the worship is done with sincerity and patience.

One g=
ood idea is to worship the Rishi who is the originator of a particular sadh=
ana. Every sadhana of every devata is somehow linked to some Rishi or the o=
ther. It is a nice idea to try and find out the link - from scriptures - an=
d then worship that Rishi who has a link to the specific sadhana being done=
. Of course the link is not always easy to find, but with persistence and p=
atience nothing is impossible!

-Regards
 Rajarshi
