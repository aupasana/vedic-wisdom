Dear Amit,


> I want to learn the proper way of pronouncing the veda mantras (in order
to read rudra namakam, chamakam, purushsuktam, srisuktam etc.) considering
all the accents. I did some preliminary search in the internet, but could
not find a consolidated step by step guide for learning vedic accents
pronounciation.


In the beginning, there is no substitute for a teacher. There are three
basic accents, and the theory is very simple. But, when we first repeat
after a teacher, we make mistakes and don't recognize it. i.e. in the
beginning, my teacher would say a mantra, and I would repeat it. He would
then correct my mistakes. Often, I didn't even understand what he was
correcting and would ask him "isn't that exactly how I repeated it?". It
takes time to develop the "musical ear". It takes time to be able to
control your voice.

A few people can listen to a song on the radio and repeat it perfectly. Most
of us can't do that. The same thing applies to vedic mantras. In the
beginning, we need feedback. If possible, learn at least some small portion
(eg. purusha sukta), from a teacher, without a book in front of you. This
will force you to go slow and develop your "musical ear".

sasneham,

    ajit
