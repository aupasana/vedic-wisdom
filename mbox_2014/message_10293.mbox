Dear all,

I was trying to forward this mail to Jyotishgroup and it is fail=
ing.
Sending mail to this group as I think many members are common

To Kann=
an ji who took offense at marking to personal id. Try to see
carefully, mai=
l was sent to jyotishgroup and not delivered, hence i
forwarded to all memb=
ers who were in discussion on this topic. You were not
exclusively marked. =
Next time free to rant but with facts.

Regards
Puneet
Namaste to all,

Now=
 that result is clear, it is time to make a judgement on predictions and
la=
ter few words on Ranter 'Kannan Iyenger' below.

1. I tracked most of the a=
strologers. Almost all were wrong. Many said
there is absolutely no chance.=
 And among other's who gave him a chance,
they were also sceptical. Bejan D=
aruwalla had said there is 54% chance of
Modi as PM. Narasimha ji said 60%.=
 These predictions were wrong as 50%
chance is for even Mulayam, Mayawati o=
r for that matter anyone contesting.
Anyone saying above 90-95% may be call=
ed correct though with the extent of
final victory, those who said 100% sho=
uld be considered correct.

2. I will look for Narasimha Ji's other predict=
ion of political instability
over next 2 years. It does not look true looki=
ng at present victory status
of BJP/NDA. His statement on AAP's performance=
 in my view is incorrect.
Punjab's success (though unexpected a month back)=
 is limited and them
losing Delhi means spectacular failure. Kejriwal is si=
lent on twitter for
last 2 days and to me it shows he is unhappy with perfo=
rmance.

3. Somebody had commented on Exit polls being wrong. On the contra=
ry, most
were right. Todays Chanakya was right to last digit (291 =C2=B1 14=

#*Cong*<https://twitter.com/search?q=3D%23Cong&src=3Dhash>57 =C2=B1 9
#*ND=
A* <https://twitter.com/search?q=3D%23NDA&src=3Dhash> 340 =C2=B114
#*UPA*<h=
ttps://twitter.com/search?q=3D%23UPA&src=3Dhash>70 =C2=B19 Others 133
=C2=
=B111 Seats). CVoter got vote percentage right (Just 1%
variation), not the=
 seat conversion. Even www.5forty3.com had predicted 320
seats for NDA and =
absolute majority for BJP. The only reason other polls
were not right to la=
st digit (Even though they got overall trend) is
because in a 'wave electio=
n' it is difficult to get seat conversion right.
How will anyone predict 72=
 seats in UP (Chanakya predicted 70 and had got
lot of flak). Overall, exit=
 polls were far more satisfying than most
astrologers

4. I have a quotatio=
n of Swami Vivekananda gifted to me by someone "You are
the creator of your=
 own destiny". While I do not have the context of this,
Modi has proved thi=
s to be true. If he had believed in astrologers, he
would not have gone on =
24th April to file nominations as that was
considered a non-auspicious day.=
 But my understanding is that he wanted
limelight for elections being held =
on that day and went with that instinct.
He got what he wanted and astrolog=
ers were proved wrong. Also, when he had
setup mission 272, it seemed impos=
sible target (No astrologer backing too),
again he went 'single minded devo=
tion and passion' to what he wanted.
Created his own destiny.

5. Now, on t=
he rants of gentleman below. Let me state it with conviction
that he seems =
to be a follower of AAP philosophy. No astrological reason
but because his =
followers are perennially angry, totally selfish and will
make big statemen=
ts without backing that with action. Following are the
issues raised by Kan=
nan in his rants

*a) 2002 'Genocide'*

Genocide is a term used for near or=
 total annihilation of a religious
group. Stupid ranters use such strong wo=
rds when 25% of people who dies in
Gujarat riots were 'Hindus'. That when t=
hey are 90% of population in
Gujarat. Many other (Mainly Hindus) have peris=
hed in bomb attacks & Jehadi
actions like Mumbai attacks. A factual descrip=
tion is available here
http://kiranasis.blogspot.in/2011/09/godhra-train-bu=
rning-yet-another-rewind.html
.
However, there will never be end to questio=
ns if Modi did enough or not .
Kannan ji is free to live in his angry delus=
ions forever.

*b) PR machinery like APCO*

*Fact 1*: Heard Dentsu? It is a=
 PR machinery from Japan who were given 500
cr contract for Rahul's image.
=
*Fact 2*: Congress spent more money in TV advertising than BJP.
*Fact 3*: C=
ongress also used Govt money to advertise about schemes and
started TV adve=
rtisement months before BJP

Why did Congress's fail so badly while BJP's P=
R spectacular success? Being
from marketing background, I can go in deep de=
tail and give you
terminologies but I will leave you with the words of a ma=
n of wisdom which
you will need to read many times to understand.

*"First =
become 'that' & projection happens automatically"*


*c) MNC backing & no d=
evelopment*

Corporate backing is clear. No development is a failed argumen=
t and I need
not give links to prove it. All election season we have heard =
and
annihilated all arguments and counter-arguments. I am sure you know tho=
se
but ranted nevertheless

Even the harshest of Modi's critics agree that =
this man has boundless
energy and works very hard. He is techno savvy and v=
isionary. Those who
listened to his speech in Varanasi yesterday would know=
 that he gave the
city and country a cleanliness mission for 2019 and tied =
it to Gandhi's
150th anniversary. That's vision and a way to motivate.

*d)=
 Hindus sitting outside should not comment*

On the contrary, Hindus when t=
hey go outside India rediscover their roots.
They also compare with Western=
 progress and want that for India. India is a
sacred land for all Hindus wh=
erever they may be in world. They have all
rights to worry about it as anyo=
ne living in India has. *Chanakya* had said
the following wise statement th=
ousand of years back and Mr. Iyenger should
read it many times

*"No countr=
y is foreign to a man of knowledge"*

*e) America is devil*

Then stop your=
 usage of American inventions. Don't use electricity,
Internet, TV, AC etc.=
 Start living in a hut and then preach. It is same
kind of rants which Isla=
mists use. They want all inventions, all dollars
from America but will want=
 it's death.

In reality, it is great that people who understand Dharma are=
 in America
and working to change it from inside. Someday one of them may b=
ecome it's
leader and will change the fate of entire earth. Hindus before 1=
0th Century
AD were very enterprising and visited entire globe. Something h=
appened
afterwards and they developed these stupid theories.

*f)  My bhara=
t mata needs no one's luck. Sanatan Dharma will protect
itself.*

Your Bhar=
at Mata has been reduced to 10% of it's influence which once
spread from Af=
ghanistan to Indonesia & even exported to China. 30% area has
been cut in l=
ast century itself. Hindus & other minorities have been
brutally annihilate=
d in Pakistan and in Bangladesh. Dharma is in danger
inside what is remaini=
ng. What did your Bharat Mata did?

Instead of pulling back the one who tal=
ks of unity and regaining strength,
look at history and learn. As Narasimha=
 ji once very eloquently said *"Even
God functions through humans"*

*I hav=
e met countless Iyers and Iyengers in my life and as a cohesive
group, they=
 are among the most intelligent humans on earth. Perhaps
generations of dev=
otion to knowledge had an impact at DNA level. But
intelligence is not the =
same as wisdom as I can see now. *

*And someone so devoted to rants may be=
 simmering with anger and urge to
respond now, missing all my points.*
