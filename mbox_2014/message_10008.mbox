Namaste,

I read one paragraph of this write-up. It is nice and I am sure s=
elf-inquiry is a very valid path.

However I have a small but crucial disag=
reement.

<<No, God will never appear before us. As we have seen in self-re=
alisation, we have to realise the Brahmam by destroying maya.=C2=A0>>


Thi=
s is not mandatory at all. Infact God can very well appear before a seeker =
in a multitude of forms and sometimes in a form that is seemingly infinite.=
 Again God can come to a seeker not as a form but as a Light. Etc. Many pos=
sibilities. That is why it is called God. He/She/it is beyond ALL limits, y=
et it rejects no option, that humans may impose on it through their minds o=
r their experiences, spiritual or otherwise.

This thing called God is best=
 described by one adjective - Infinite. And the basic character of Infinity=
 is that it can't be totally understood by anyone. You can only understand =
some parts of it, every the entirety. Being Infinite, it is beyond restrict=
ions. So it is both with form and without form. And at times even simultane=
ously. [Sounds illogical no? But Infinity was anyway, even in mathematics, =
never within the purview of normal logic.]

It is only the limitations of t=
he seeker which limits the experience of God in all its totality. He/She/It=
 is the sum total of all that is imaginable, all that is difficult to imagi=
ne and all that just cannot be humanly imagined. Forms, therefore, get incl=
uded inside it.

Of forms again there are various characteristics. Not all =
forms are similar. The same devata can appear in two different nature of fo=
rm depending on the seeker, one maybe more sutble than the other.

Basicall=
y noting every single possibility makes it tremendously complicated, but bo=
ttomline is that God is both with form and also without form. And one is no=
t necessarily higher than the other aspect of God.

That's my view. Feel fr=
ee to disagree. No imposition.

-Regards

Hi All, 

One really short simple summary o=
f the path
http://www.manblunder.com/2009/01/path.html
http://www.manblunde=
r.com/2009/01/final-destination.html


THE PATH
We
have seen a few steps to=
wards self-realisation. Now let us discuss its
implementation. 
=C2=A0
Medi=
tation
is the entry door for self-realisation. Normally, when we sit for me=
ditation,
we make so many preparations, like breathing exercises, bending a=
nd stretching
exercises, etc. We begin our meditation, as if God is going t=
o appear before
us. No, God will never appear before us. As we have seen in=
 self-realisation,
we have to realise the Brahmam by destroying maya. The f=
irst step in
meditation is to question ourselves. This is Ramana Maharishi=
=E2=80=99s teaching.
We have to enquire =E2=80=9Cwho I am=E2=80=9D. Think a=
bout our origin, how we had come to this
earth, who would have created us a=
nd why we have come to this earth. It is
difficult to find answers to these=
 questions in the beginning. But when we
probe deep into our self, we will =
get answers one by one. Only after getting
answers for these questions, we =
can think of realizing the Brahmam. During
this, we need not necessarily lo=
ok into the basic aspects of meditation. When
we are set to seriously think=
 about the cause of our existence in this earth,
it is only the beginning o=
f the process of realisation. During these initial
stages, we are neither g=
oing to drive away our thoughts, nor manifest anything.
Bagwan Ramakrishna =
Paramahamsa showed the form of Mother Kali to Vivekananda.
Vivekananda did =
have the vision of the Mother Kali. When we are talking of
Brahman as the f=
ormless, how can Bagwan Ramakrishna show the divine Mother in
flesh and blo=
od? That is because of the power of manifestation of Ramakrishna
Paramahams=
a. That kind of manifestation is extremely difficult for people like
us, as=
 we have our own karmas to perform. The utmost concentration is necessary
f=
or such manifestation. 
=C2=A0
Now a
days it has become a fashion to get ou=
rselves associated with Kundalini yoga.
Except you, nobody can ever raise y=
our kundalini energy. Even if you practice
for years, self realisation thro=
ugh kundalini yoga is ruled out, as there are
no proper gurus. So, let us n=
ot be under the impression that kundalini yoga
will pave the way for quick =
self realisation. It is a misconcept. Realisation cannot be achieved quickl=
y. It will take its own time, in many births. 
=C2=A0
When
we start probing=
 deeper and deeper into our own self, we will first realise our
concern for=
 all living beings. We will start feeding the animals and birds with
our ow=
n hands. Then, we will start feeding the poor and hungry humans. Tears
will=
 roll down our eyes when we feel and see their happiness. If we decide to
d=
o the feeding with pomp and vanity, we only add our bad karmas. If we decid=
e
to feed them through our servants, again there is no use. No doubt, their=

hunger will be satisfied. But we will not get that everlasting happiness. =
This
happiness will subsequently blossom into eternal bliss. This is the fi=
rst step
in realisation. We cannot attain this stage by sitting in so calle=
d meditation
for hours together. The ultimate stage in meditation is that w=
e should be
meditating perpetually. We need no separate time to meditate. M=
editation will
be happening always. So, in the initial stages of self reali=
sation, we will
have concern for others. The concept of co-existence will b=
e realised. This in
turn will lead us to internal rejoice. We will take par=
t in others happiness
and sorrow. The hatred will not be there. Eternal lov=
e will start engulfing us.
We all know that love is God. Then what next? Ho=
w do we proceed further? 
=C2=A0
From
the initial level we are now going to=
 move to the middle level.
We have learnt to love others, thereby making ou=
r inner self to rejoice. Next
step is to focus our attention on some form. =
We should remember here that Brahmam
is formless. But for the purpose of ou=
r concentration and focus, let us
manifest some form of a deity, like Ramak=
rishna Paramahamsa had done. We have
to manifest a very clear form of the d=
eity, which is usually called =E2=80=9CIshta
Devata=E2=80=9D. We can use ou=
r imaginative power to give a form to this deity. For
example, the deity=E2=
=80=99s complexion is blue. He or she has four or two hands. The
crown on t=
he head, the dress they wear, the weapons they hold and all such
minute det=
ails. Constant and regular manifestation over a period of time will
make th=
e deity real for us. By regularly practicing this manifestation, we can
sta=
rt two way communications with the deity. This is absolutely possible and
d=
epends upon the power of our sadhana (practice). Initially, we may not be a=
ble
to decipher the communication from the deity. But over a period of time=
, we can
understand. Since, the deity is created by our own manifestation; =
the
communication will be in a language known to us. Here the frequency and=

dedication are very important. 
Let
us understand that this is not the fin=
al stage of realisation and only a middle
level. Let us also not confuse be=
tween Brahmam, which is Supreme and formless
and our Ishta Devata, to whom =
we have given a form to our liking. 
=C2=A0
This
middle level mainly emphas=
izes on sadhana. We can also set specific times in a
day to do this sadhana=
. At least two sessions of half an hour a day is the
minimum. Two things ar=
e important. One is that our stomach should not be full.
Second, no disturb=
ance during this time. 
=C2=A0
If we
are able to achieve our goals in the f=
irst and the middle stages, the third and
final stage of realizing the Brah=
mam will be easier. This stage will be
discussed subsequently.
=C2=A0
=C2=
=A0
=C2=A0
THE
FINAL DESTINATION 
=C2=A0
After
thoroughly understanding the=
 first two stages, we have to enter into the third
stage. We have already s=
een that Ishta Devata is important in one=E2=80=99s spiritual
progress. Thi=
s Ishta Devata alone will take us to the ultimate stage. Ishta
Devata is li=
ke a Guru. We will get instructions from Ishta Devata quite often,
when we =
are nearing the final stage. So what is this final stage? This is
nothing b=
ut identifying ourselves with Brahman, the God. We have already learnt
to i=
dentify ourselves with our Ishta Devata, to whom we have a form. But
Brahma=
m does not have a form. He is the cause of the creation of the Universe.
We=
 have to identify ourselves with the formless, which is by no means an easy=

task. 
=C2=A0
The
first thing in the final stage is understand the clear d=
istinction between the
Brahman and the maya. We have already seen that maya=
 is surrounding the Brahman
as a sheath. So, for knowing the Brahman we hav=
e to go past this sheath. Maya
controls all our deeds and actions. It makes=
 us to laugh and cry. But Brahman
does not act. You can know a table as tab=
le on seeing the table, as it has a
form. The knowing a table as a table is=
 the work of Maya, the illusion. But in
the case of the Brahman, we have to=
 realise something that is the Supreme in
this universe which does not have=
 a form. We have to visualize the form
of the formless. How do we go about =
it? =E2=80=9CAham Brahmam asmi=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Ctat
twam asi=E2=80=9D =
are the two famous sayings from the Vedas. Both have the same
meaning. Aham=
 means =E2=80=98I am=E2=80=99. Asmi means existing. Te literal meaning is =
=E2=80=9CI am
existing as Brahmam=E2=80=9D. Tat means =E2=80=98that=E2=80=
=99. Twam means =E2=80=98you=E2=80=99. Asi means existing.
The literal mean=
ing is =E2=80=9Cyou are existing as that=E2=80=9D. Here =E2=80=98that=E2=80=
=99 means Brahmam. 
=C2=A0
The
initial two stages help us here. The first s=
tage is the universal love, the
concern for others. The second stage is sad=
hana with manifestation. The third and
final stage is realizing us as God. =
Unless somebody has gone through the first
two stages meticulously, the fin=
al stage is just not possible. 
=C2=A0
Now
let us enter into the final stag=
e. The first thing in the final stage is to get
away from the attachment. T=
he =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 concept should be completely taken away from
your co=
nsciousness. If we have leftover ego, nothing will work for us. We must
dev=
elop the attitude that God will take care of everything. We must also
under=
stand that whatever one does, that will be the will of God only. The
action=
s are controlled by the God and not by the individual. If somebody hurts
us=
, we should think that the God has decided to hurt us at this appointed tim=
e
and the God has done that act of hurting through that person. In the fina=
l
stage only our mind alone need to work. There should be no thoughts in ou=
r mind
other than the thought of the form of the formless. The absolute pur=
ity of our
mind is essential. Even a small distraction will spoil everythin=
g. That is why
during this period ancient saints went to mountains and fore=
sts just to focus
their attention on Brahman. It is extremely difficult to =
focus on something
that does not have a form. Only at this stage the true m=
editation is to be
practiced. For a true meditation, no particular posture =
is required. We can lie
down on the floor and meditate. The form of the Ish=
ta Devata, our Guru should
disappear. There will me no more Guru. No more t=
eaching. No more chanting. No
more rituals. We need to do nothing. From her=
e on every activity will be
different for each individual. It bill be nothi=
ng but total bliss; total
ananda, the Oneness. 
=C2=A0
Once
we follow these=
 principles, the exact realisation will happen at any time and
will take on=
ly a few seconds. Only for these few seconds, we have to take so
many birth=
s. From the moment of realisation, we will be different. We will not
be jus=
t humans. We will be part of Creation. We will merge with Him. But please
u=
nderstand that we can only merge with Him and not become God. God is all
al=
one. He does not need anybody. 

>From this moment onwards, we can pray for =
others. What ever we say will come
true. For a moment if our ego takes over=
, everything will be lost. We have then
to undergo the ordeal of births aft=
er births. We live like others, we do
everything like others. But we are di=
fferent. The bliss will be reflected in
our body. Body will shine. Our spee=
ch will be different. We will not take
credit for anything. Now one can say=
 =E2=80=9CAham Brahmam asmi=E2=80=9D. Those who realise
this become Brahman=
, that is merges with the Brahman.

<div c=
lass=3D"yiv8758927147MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;">We
hav=
e seen a few steps towards self-realisation. Now let us discuss its
impleme=
ntation. </span></div>

<div class=3D"yiv8758927147MsoNoSpacing"><span styl=

<div class=3D"yiv8758927147Mso=
NoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;">Meditation
is the entry door f=
or self-realisation. Normally, when we sit for meditation,
we make so many =
preparations, like breathing exercises, bending and stretching
exercises, e=
tc. We begin our meditation, as if God is going to appear before
us. No, Go=
d will never appear before us. As we have seen in self-realisation,
we have=
 to realise the Brahmam by destroying maya. <u>The first step in
meditation=
 is to question ourselves.</u> This is Ramana Maharishi=E2=80=99s teaching.=

We have to enquire =E2=80=9Cwho I am=E2=80=9D. Think about our origin, how=
 we had come to this
earth, who would have created us and why we have come =
to this earth. It is
difficult to find answers to these questions in the be=
ginning. But when we
probe deep into our self, we will get answers one by o=
ne. Only after getting
answers for these questions, we can think of realizi=
ng the Brahmam. During
this, we need not necessarily look into the basic as=
pects of meditation. When
we are set to seriously think about the cause of =
our existence in this earth,
it is only the beginning of the process of rea=
lisation. During these initial
stages, we are neither going to drive away o=
ur thoughts, nor manifest anything.
Bagwan Ramakrishna Paramahamsa showed t=
he form of Mother Kali to Vivekananda.
Vivekananda did have the vision of t=
he Mother Kali. When we are talking of
Brahman as the formless, how can Bag=
wan Ramakrishna show the divine Mother in
flesh and blood? That is because =
of the power of manifestation of Ramakrishna
Paramahamsa. That kind of mani=
festation is extremely difficult for people like
us, as we have our own kar=
mas to perform. The utmost concentration is necessary
for such manifestatio=
n. </span></div>

<div class=3D"yiv8758927147MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"f=
ont-size:12.0pt;"> </span></div>

<div class=3D"yiv8758927147MsoNoSpac=
ing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;">Now a
days it has become a fashion t=
o get ourselves associated with Kundalini yoga.
Except you, nobody can ever=
 raise your kundalini energy. Even if you practice
for years, self realisat=
ion through kundalini yoga is ruled out, as there are
no proper gurus. So, =
let us not be under the impression that kundalini yoga
will pave the way fo=
r quick self realisation. It is a misconcept. <b><u>Realisation</u></b>
can=
not be achieved quickly. It will take its own time, in many births. </span>=
</div>

<div class=3D"yiv8758927147MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:1=
2.0pt;"> </span></div>

<div class=3D"yiv8758927147MsoNoSpacing"><span=
 style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;">When
we start probing deeper and deeper into o=
ur own self, we will first realise our
concern for all living beings. We wi=
ll start feeding the animals and birds with
our own hands. Then, we will st=
art feeding the poor and hungry humans. Tears
will roll down our eyes when =
we feel and see their happiness. If we decide to
do the feeding with pomp a=
nd vanity, we only add our bad karmas. If we decide
to feed them through ou=
r servants, again there is no use. No doubt, their
hunger will be satisfied=
. But we will not get that everlasting happiness. This
happiness will subse=
quently blossom into eternal bliss. This is the first step
in realisation. =
We cannot attain this stage by sitting in so called meditation
for hours to=
gether. The ultimate stage in meditation is that we should be
meditating pe=
rpetually. We need no separate time to meditate. Meditation will
be happeni=
ng always. So, in the initial stages of self realisation, we will
have conc=
ern for others. The concept of co-existence will be realised. This in
turn =
will lead us to internal rejoice. We will take part in others happiness
and=
 sorrow. The hatred will not be there. Eternal love will start engulfing us=
.
We all know that love is God. Then what next? How do we proceed further? =
</span></div>

<div class=3D"yiv8758927147MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font=

<div class=3D"yiv8758927147MsoNoSpacing=
"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt;">From
the initial level we are now going=
 to move to the <b><u>middle level</u></b>.
We have learnt to love others, =
thereby making our inner self to rejoice. Next
step is to focus our attenti=
on on some form. We should remember here that <b><u>Brahmam
is formless</u>=
</b>. But for the purpose of our concentration and focus, let us
manifest s=
ome form of a deity, like Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had done. We have
to mani=
fest a very clear form of the deity, which is usually called =E2=80=9CIshta=

Devata=E2=80=9D. We can use our imaginative power to give a form to this d=
eity. For
example, the deity=E2=80=99s complexion is blue. He or she has fo=
ur or two hands. The
crown on the head, the dress they wear, the weapons th=
ey hold and all such
minute details. Constant and regular manifestation ove=
r a period of time will
make the deity real for us. By regularly practicing=
 this manifestation, we can
start two way communications with the deity. Th=
is is absolutely possible and
depends upon the power of our sadhana (practi=
ce). Initially, we may not be able
to decipher the communication from the d=
eity. But over a period of time, we can
understand. Since, the deity is cre=
ated by our own manifestation; the
communication will be in a language know=
n to us. Here the frequency and
dedication are very important. </span></div=

<div class=3D"yiv8758927147MsoNoSpacing"><span style=3D"font-size:12.0pt=
;">Let
us understand that this is not the final stage of realisation and on=
ly a middle
level. Let us also not confuse between Brahmam, which is Suprem=
e and formless
and our Ishta Devata, to whom we have given a form to our li=
king. </span></div>

middle level mainly emphas=

day to do this sadhana=
. At least two sessions of half an hour a day is the
minimum. Two things ar=
e important. One is that our stomach should not be full.
Second, no disturb=
ance during this time. </span></div>

thoroughly understanding the first two stages, we have to enter into=
 the third
stage. We have already seen that Ishta Devata is important in on=

progress. This Ishta Devata alone will take us to the=
 ultimate stage. Ishta
Devata is like a Guru. We will get instructions from=
 Ishta Devata quite often,
when we are nearing the final stage. So what is =
this final stage? This is
nothing but identifying ourselves with Brahman, t=
he God. We have already learnt
to identify ourselves with our Ishta Devata,=
 to whom we have a form. But
Brahmam does not have a form. He is the cause =
of the creation of the Universe.
We have to identify ourselves with the for=
mless, which is by no means an easy
task. </span></div>

controls all our deeds and actions. It makes us to laugh=
 and cry. But Brahman
does not act. You can know a table as table on seeing=
 the table, as it has a
form. The knowing a table as a table is the work of=

<div class=3D"yiv8758927147MsoNoSpacing"><span style=

let us enter into the final stage. The first thi=
ng in the final stage is to get
away from the attachment. The =E2=80=98I=E2=
=80=99 concept should be completely taken away from
your consciousness. If =
we have leftover ego, nothing will work for us. We must
develop the attitud=
e that God will take care of everything. We must also
understand that whate=
ver one does, that will be the will of God only. The
actions are controlled=
 by the God and not by the individual. If somebody hurts
us, we should thin=
k that the God has decided to hurt us at this appointed time
and the God ha=
s done that act of hurting through that person. In the final
stage only our=
 mind alone need to work. There should be no thoughts in our mind
other tha=
n the thought of the form of the formless. The absolute purity of our
mind =
is essential. Even a small distraction will spoil everything. That is why
d=
uring this period ancient saints went to mountains and forests just to focu=
s
their attention on Brahman. It is extremely difficult to focus on somethi=
ng
that does not have a form. Only at this stage the true meditation is to =
be
practiced. For a true meditation, no particular posture is required. We =
can lie
down on the floor and meditate. The form of the Ishta Devata, our G=
uru should
disappear. There will me no more Guru. No more teaching. No more=
 chanting. No
more rituals. We need to do nothing. From here on every activ=
ity will be
different for each individual. It bill be nothing but total bli=
ss; total
ananda, the Oneness. </span></div>

we =
follow these principles, the exact realisation will happen at any time and

many births. From the moment of realisation, we will be different. We wil=

be just humans. We will be part of Creation. We will merge with Him. =
