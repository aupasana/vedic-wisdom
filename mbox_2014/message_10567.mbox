Namaste Narasimha ji and everyone.

I have a question about next life.

I a=
ctually feel very lucky and blessed to know about and chant different Sansk=
rit mantras, stotrams, namavali etc. Also I feel myself lucky from most for=
 being able to read Vedic horoscope to some degree.

Suppose I do enough go=
od karma for being born next time as a human. Then it is highly unlikely th=
at I will, again in that life, have knowledge about mantras etc. People lar=
gely do not even believe in mantras, even many so called modern Hindus do n=
ot believe that mantras can cause spiritual and worldly benefits. And I am =
very sure that it is their own karma. Plus mantras, shastras are getting mo=
re and more corrupt, altered day by day and good books on these subjects ar=
e also being fewer and fewer. So if I am born after 100, 200 or 500 or 1,00=
0 years, it is highly unlikely that I will be blessed chanting mantras agai=
n.

But I have a strong desire for doing mantras and Jyotish every birth. S=
ince we know that births are based on desire, can my strong desire lead my =
next births in such a direction that I can do mantras in next birth also?

=
Plus, what can I do to make sure that I will come to know about Vedas, Vedi=
c mantras etc. in the next birth? If this desire continues all my life and =
all my life I do mantras and homam regularly, will it be enough to bless me=
 with the same type of knowledge (and opportunity) in the next birth also? =
I just want to make sure that I get to know about mantras, homam etc. in ne=
xt birth and esp. from a good, authentic source.

Thanks
Tanvir
