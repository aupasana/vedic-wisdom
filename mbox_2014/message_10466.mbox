Nameste Narsimhaji,

Need your guidance. 

For all days of navaratri how ca=
n we include our prayers and aahutis for Das Mahavidyas while doing Chandi =
Homam.

Can we offer aahutis for Das Mahavidyas along with respective beeja=
 mantras while offering Parivaraa Devta aahuits or we do it along with Prad=
haana homam. Kindly guide. 
 
How do we relate Das Mahavidyas with or eithe=
r wtih Mahakali, Mahalakshmi & Mahasaraswati. 

Regards,
Rakesh

 Best wishes to everyone for Devi=
 SaranNavaRatris! This is a

 Chandi homam, any prayers of Durga, prayers of Rama, Sundara

kanda etc.
 
 
 
 *        *        *
 
 
 
 Many people apply tithi of sun=
rise to the entire day. This
 is IMHO applicable for celebrations/poojas th=
at primarily
 take place in the morning at sunrise time (which is the case
=
 traditionally with most poojas).
 
 
 
 But some poojas (e.g. Satya Naraya=
na vratam) happen at
 sunset and you have to see tithi at that time. For
 M=
ahashivaratri, shastras are clear that Magha Krishna
 Chaturdasi should be =
active at midnight when the special
 pooja is to be done.
 
 
 
 In general=
, you are better off checking the tithi at the
 time of your pooja, esp if =
your pooja is happening way after
 sunrise.
 
 
 
 Navaratris are centered =
around the evening time pooja (name
 itself has ratri =3D night). Ideally, =
you should check the
 tithi at sunset and not sunrise. In my reckoning also=
,
 navaratris start on 24th itself in India too.
 
 
 
 Where I live (near =
Boston, MA, USA), it is 24th either way.
 Sukla pratipada starts in the nig=
ht and active at sunrise of
 24th and at sunset too. So navaratris clearly =
start on 24th
 (Wednesday).
 
 
 
 However, someone people who blindly foll=
ow Indian calendars
 are thinking that it starts on 25th. Depending on the
=
 definition used, one can argue 24th or 25th for India, but
 it is 24th eit=
her way in US.
 
 
 
 Best regards,
 
 
 
 Narasimha
