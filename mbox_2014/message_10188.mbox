Namsttay Everyone,
I forward herewith a write-up of mine written elsewhere, so as to benefit
members of vedic-wisdom. This is a part of a conversation between me and a
seeker. I share it here with you all, hoping it to benefit all of you. Thank
You.

[Seeker:]
Why the fate is so harsh? Why even good people have to suffer? What is the
cause for fate? What is the rule behind it, to manifest? What is the cause
for happiness and misery?
[Kannan:]
I appreciate your question very much, and I would take delight in answering
it.
You are focused on "cause-effect" relationship. In this case, every "event"
which occurs needs a "precedence" or "pre-event" or " synchronous co-event"
called as "cause". This will happen if the progression of Kaala is either
linear or circular. In fact, a small arc of a circle is just a line. So
linear and circular are technically called 1-Dimensional geometrical entity
called "line"; with the only difference being that a line segment has
different starting point and end point, whereas a circular line segment(also
called arc) has same starting and ending point.

Now in order to answer your question, this adherence to "cause-effect" will
not help. Because, your question is even beyond this. Your question is a
deeply philosophical one. But the answer is there.

Now, from the perspective of Truth or Ultimate Reality or ParaBrahman or
Self or Aatmaa or Supreme Being, there is no space, no time, no progression,
no cause-effect. It just exists, and nothing else exists.Thus it is "Sat".

Now listen carefully. This Aatma has a "center of desire" or
"vaasnaa-kendra" called "Chitta". This "Chitta" is also a permanent nature
of Aatma just like "Sat".  "Sat" is its continued ever-lasting existence.
Thus the Aatma dwells in "Sat" and "Chitta", and hence is called
"Sat-Chitt-Aananda", meaning one who dwells in "Sat" and "Chitta",
blissfully.
 Aum Shri Satchittaanda Parabrahma Purushottama Paramaatma.

Now, This Aatmaa always exist in either of one of the following states or
"awastha" called jaagruta(waking), swapna(dreaming), sushupta(sleeping), and
turiya(moksha); just like an ordinary human being sleeps, dreams and is
awake, but he exists in all the 3 states, witnessing each and all of them.

Just like Aatma is Shaaswatam(ever-existing) likewise its witnessing of each
of these states is also Shaashwatam. Means, it is always, at any given
instant, found witnessing one of these states.

The Chitta of Aatma is the centre of desires. All these states are in Chitta
only except turiya. An Aatma as "Sat" is in Turiya state. But An aatma as
"Chitta" is witnessing one of the other three states namely, Jaagruta,
Swapna and Sushupti. I hope this line very well summarises the whole point.

Now, this Jaagruta or Waking state of Aatma is called "Srushti" or
"Creation" or "World" or "Brahmanda" or "Cosmos" which is visibly manifested
and witnessed. This is Day.
The Sushupti or Sleeping state of Aatma is the "pralaya" or "dissolution".
This is Night.

And this cycle of Aatma keeps repeating again and again, permanently,
everlastingly. Just like aatma is nitya(everlasting) and satya(Truth), this
repetition of cycle of waking and sleeping is also nitya and satya means
everlasting and truth.

Swapna is not an independent stable state, rather it is a transition state
from waking to sleeping or from sleeping to waking.

This is why the Aatma is expressed in word as "AUM..". 
A - jaagruta or srushti or creation
M- sushupti or nidra or pralaya or sleeping state.
U- transition.

If you open your mouth to say "A", then its creation. If you close your lips
to say "M", its dissolution, and "U" is the transition that you experience
while shuttling between A and M.
The brief reverberating silence just after AUM is Turiya.

Now, Aatmaa is also called "chaitanya" or "consciousness" or "awareness" or
"existence".

Having said upto this, the answer is slowly revealing now. The chitta is a
collection of vrittis or shades of desires, which seek to manifest. Every
individual is Aatma whose chitta has manifested its vrittis and manifested
as a lifetime. There are many latent vrittis hidden in chitta yet
unmanifested. This is what is called "karmic sediments".

Just like Aatma is ever-lasting ,this chitta is also everlasting and with
every lifetime, new vrittis are continuously created every moment, and at
the same time old vrittis keep manifesting.

Jyotisha Vidya is all about studying the surya-mandala, so as to understand
which vritti is going to manifest in this given space and time interval on
earth, in this lifetime.

Through remedies, the vritti that is about to manifest can be nulled and
burnt at its very core, and thus blocking it from manifesting. But this
requires a higher level of awareness. 

The reason for misery is ignorance(avidya), wrong identity of the self with
something else, unable to digest manifesting vrittis going against one's own
agenda.

Dear Everyone,
The post is getting longer but the subject is too involved. I hope I have
fairly approached closer in answering you, if not answered you completely to
your satisfaction.
We will see more later. Thank You.

With Kind Regards,
Kannan

Now, from the perspective of=
 Truth or Ultimate Reality or ParaBrahman or Self
or Aatmaa or Supreme Bein=
g, there is no space, no time, no progression, no
cause-effect. It just exi=
sts, and nothing else exists.Thus it is “Sat”.<br>
<br>
Now lis=
ten carefully. This Aatma has a “center of desire” or “va=
asnaa-kendra”
called “Chitta”. This “Chitta” =
is also a permanent nature of Aatma just like
“Sat”.  R=
20;Sat” is its continued ever-lasting existence. Thus the Aatma
dwell=
s in “Sat” and “Chitta”, and hence is called “=
;Sat-Chitt-Aananda”, meaning
one who dwells in “Sat” and =
“Chitta”, blissfully.<br>
 Aum Shri Satchittaanda Parabrah=
ma Purushottama Paramaatma.<br>
<br>
Now, This Aatmaa always exist in eithe=
r of one of the following states or
“awastha” called jaagruta(w=
aking), swapna(dreaming), sushupta(sleeping), and
turiya(moksha); just like=
 an ordinary human being sleeps, dreams and is awake,
but he exists in all =
the 3 states, witnessing each and all of them.<br>
<br>
Just like Aatma is =
Shaaswatam(ever-existing) likewise its witnessing of each of
these states i=
s also Shaashwatam. Means, it is always, at any given instant,
found witnes=
sing one of these states.<br>
<br>
<b>The Chitta of Aatma is the centre of =
desires. All these states are in Chitta
only except turiya. An Aatma as =
220;Sat” is in Turiya state. But An aatma as
”Chitta” is =
witnessing one of the other three states namely, Jaagruta, Swapna
and Sushu=
pti. I hope this line very well summarises the whole point.</b><br>
<br>
No=
w, this Jaagruta or Waking state of Aatma is called “Srushti” o=
r “Creation”
or “World” or “Brahmanda” =
or “Cosmos” which is visibly manifested and
witnessed. This is =
Day.<br>
The Sushupti or Sleeping state of Aatma is the “pralaya̶=
1; or “dissolution”. This
is Night.<br>
<br>
And this cycle of =
Aatma keeps repeating again and again, permanently,
everlastingly. Just lik=
e aatma is nitya(everlasting) and satya(Truth), this
repetition of cycle of=
 waking and sleeping is also nitya and satya means
everlasting and truth.<b=
r>
<br>
Swapna is not an independent stable state, rather it is a transitio=
n state from
waking to sleeping or from sleeping to waking.<br>
<br>
This i=
s why the Aatma is expressed in word as “AUM….”. <br>
A &=
#8211; jaagruta or srushti or creation<br>
M- sushupti or nidra or pralaya =
or sleeping state.<br>
U- transition.<br>
<br>
If you open your mouth to sa=
y “A”, then its creation. If you close your lips to
say “=
M”, its dissolution, and “U” is the transition that you e=
xperience while
shuttling between A and M.<br>
The brief reverberating sile=
nce just after AUM is Turiya.<br>
</span><br>
Now, Aatmaa is also called &#=
8220;chaitanya” or “consciousness” or “awareness=
221; or
“existence”.<br>
<span style=3D'color:black'><br>
Havin=
g said upto this, the answer is slowly revealing now. The chitta is a
colle=
ction of vrittis or shades of desires, which seek to manifest. Every
indivi=
dual is Aatma whose chitta has manifested its vrittis and manifested as a
l=
ifetime. There are many latent vrittis hidden in chitta yet unmanifested. T=
his
is what is called “karmic sediments”.<br>
<br>
Just like Aa=
tma is ever-lasting ,this chitta is also everlasting and with every
lifetim=
e, new vrittis are continuously created every moment, and at the same
time =
old vrittis keep manifesting.<br>
<br>
Jyotisha Vidya is all about studying=
 the surya-mandala, so as to understand
which vritti is going to manifest i=
n this given space and time interval on
earth, in this lifetime.<br>
<br>
T=
hrough remedies, the vritti that is about to manifest can be nulled and bur=
nt
at its very core, and thus blocking it from manifesting. But this requir=
es a
higher level of awareness. <br>
<br>
The reason for misery is ignoranc=
e(avidya), wrong identity of the self with
something else, unable to digest=
 manifesting vrittis going against one’s own
agenda.<br>
