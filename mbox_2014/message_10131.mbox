Subject: How to perform rudrabhisheka?

Dear Group Members,

Now a days, the priests are not learned enough to prop=
erly perform rudrabhisheka. I have seen the priests who do it just for mone=
y without any devotion, and few of them don't even chant 'CHAMAKAM' durng t=
he rudrabhisheka.
Is there any standard procedure for rudrabhisheka? It wou=
ld be really great if some one points me to the correct procedure. Mr. P. V=
. R. Narasimha Rao has done a great service by providing simplified homam p=
rocedure on his website vedivastrologer.org. If similar type of resources a=
re created for rudrabhisheka, it will be a great help for people like me wh=
o want to do the abhishekam on their own.

Thanks & Regards
Amit Agrawal

  Midnight is the best time.

a few questions

 1) Is Maha Shiva R=

 =C2=A0
 2) What is the best =
time
 for prayers in Maha Shiva 
 Ratri? Is it recommended to pray all nigh=
t? As early evening
 / dusk is the best 
 time for prayers / japam in gener=
al, and some say that
 Around midnight (12 AM) 
 it is the time of Kali and=
 so prayers / japam should not be
 done. Would like to 
 know your views on=
 this.
 =C2=A0
 3) Any special advices

 on Sh=

 4) Any
