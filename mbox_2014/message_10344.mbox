Namaste,

Your keen observation is impressive!


Yes, that anusvara is pron=
ounced by most scholars as "gum" or "gam". But, given that it is supposed t=
o be just a nasal sound, I am not convinced by the explicit occurrence of t=
he consonant "g". IMHO, it is definitely a Kali yuga corruption.

*=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *

This one is tricky. But there are=
 more common sounds, e.g. vowel ai as in 
"aim" beeja and "aindri" word, vo=
wel ru/ri as in "rushi" or 
"rishi", hanging consonant "t" at the end of "p=
rachodayaat" etc. Most people do not pronounce these correctly. These occur=
 
in simple words, as opposed to this anuswara which occurs in complex 
Ved=
a mantras only. There are several such things where no single region 
of In=
dia got it right. Different parts of India are correct in different things.=


Fortunately, the correct pronunciation of all these 
sounds is confidentl=
y and accurately derivable based on grammar rules 
etc, if only one applies=
 oneself and thinks straight. Over the years, I have identified several of =
these, convinced myself 100% on 
each (except the anuswara where I am not 1=
00% sure) and switched my 
pronunciation accordingly.

However, now I am 10=
0% convinced that pronunciation 
is only 1% of the thing and devotion and s=
incerity are far more 
important, though correct pronunciation may be initi=
ally useful.

So I am not that motivated to correct people's pronunciation.=
 But, given that 
several insights came to me on this over the years, it is=
 probably one 
of my dharmas to share them with the world before I leave. I=
 will try to do it soon. I thought of making a youtube video on "pronunciat=
ion of tricky Sanskrit sounds" many years ago (showing my face and a white =
board). Perhaps time has come to just do it.

*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *

Coming back to this anuswara:

Bindu before p, ph, b,=
 bh is pronounced as one nasal (m);bindu before t, th, d, dh is pronounced =
as another nasal (n); bindu before k, kh, g, gh is pronounced as another na=
sal; bindu before ch, chh, j, jh is pronounced as another nasal, etc.

My t=
ake is that bindu before y, r, l, v, sh, Sh, s, h is to be pronounced as th=
e first one again, i.e. as the nasal before k, kh, g, gh.

Take the mantra =
"tanno nArasi{M}haH prachodayAt", where {M} is this anuswara. A lot of scho=
lars pronounce this as "tanno nArasiguMhaH prachodayAt". IMHO, that is way =
off and has an extra syllable. You are better off just pronouncing it as "t=
anno nArasimhaH prachodayAt", i.e. pronounce {M} as "m" or the nasal before=
 p, ph, b, bh.

But better IMHO is to pronounce it as the nasal before g. S=
tart off as though you are saying "tanno nArasinghaH prachodayAt", suppress=
 "g" when about to say it, and jump directly to "h". That is what I do. Thi=
s allows you to pronounce the correct nasal. Unless we are about to say, k,=
 kh, g or gh, we can't say that nasal. Of course, in some languages (e.g. V=
ietnamese), that nasal occurs independently and those people can pronounce =
it well.

BTW, if you end up letting out a bit of "g" instead of suppressin=
g it completely and jumping to "h", then you end up getting "singha", which=
 is another common corruption of "si{M}ha".

To put it simply: The correct =
pronunciation is neither "sinha" nor "simha" nor "singha". It is "sin(g)ha"=
 with g silent.

Best regards,
Narasimha

g 
Rudra-Prashna I came across an uncommon anusvara. With some studies from=

I learnt that it is called 'agamanusvara' and=A0occurs commonly i=
n 
Yajur-veda.

on the net keep it impo=

how to pronounce i=

as 'gm' or =
'g(u)m' which do not convince me, because it is an anuswara by 
definition.=

>Later I remembered coming 
across this anusvara in Ganapati-Atharvas=
hirsham (saMhita-sandhih), I listened 
to your (Narasimha ji's) two audios =
on it, both instances you had uttered it as 
'sang-hita' (with a nasal tone=
), where the 'sang' sounds like English words 
ping, sing, ring, king etc. =
