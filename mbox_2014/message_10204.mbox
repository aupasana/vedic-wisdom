Some questions are mostly theoretical, and have very little impact on our
lives, especially when we are heavily conditioned by vAsanAs. Other
questions are more relevant. Can you shed some light on practical
techniques that we can use to better judge and improve our "listening"
skills?

We are often told to "listen to your inner voice, and follow your dharma".
Given that there are various levels of dharma that we participate in
(rAShTra dharma, kula dharma, sva dharma etc), and given that dharmic dos
and don'ts change over time (though the underlying principles may remain
constant), how do we discover and move in accordance to dharma?

We are told to "give more, and take less". It is relatively easy to see
this in simple interactions (eg. i can buy a third cup of starbucks'
coffee, or donate to some worthy person or cause). However, most
interactions involve multiple people and complex circumstances, where the
opportunity cost of giving to one person is the ability to give to another
person.

Most of us are mired firmly in the world, and are in the throes of rAga,
shoka and moha. Our ability to see adharma as adharma, and dharma as dharma
is murky at best. Until we are given clear instructions like Krishna's
"tasmAt yudhyasva bhArata" instruction to Arjuna, how might we develop the
skills to calm the mind and listen to what the various voices have to say?

Are we stuck randomly oscillating between dharma and adharma, until our
sadhana allows us to start coming out of the vicious cycle of samsAra?

sasneham,

    ajit
