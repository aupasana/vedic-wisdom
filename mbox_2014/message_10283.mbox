Dear gurus,
It may be a childish to ask such a question. It may be personal=
, official or health problems. Some people may suggest to do some poojas, H=
omams, how to overcome the problems of life? Is kaliyuga like that only? Wh=
en our problems ll end? What might be the reason for this misery? When the =
whole world become spiritual base? When do we find joyous people?
