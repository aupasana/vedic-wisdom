Namaste friends,

There is so much pride and fear in religious adherence of=
 this age!

This is kind of like saying, "if you have a piggy bank at your =
home and don't put money in it every month", your finances will be spoiled.=
 Well, probably my finances ARE spoiled if I am not putting money in the pi=
ggy bank. :-) But not putting money in piggy bank itself will not cause any=
 problems.

Shiva lingas, idols etc are just like piggy banks that store mo=
ney. Originally they are just stone/metal/glass/whatever. There is god in t=
hem, in the sense that there is god everywhere. There is no special/concent=
rated divine presence. As people reverently imagine divine presence in them=
 regularly, slowly a real divine presence is formed and grown in them. Over=
 time, a considerable divine presence is formed, which can actually help on=
e in a time of spiritual need. This is just like how a piggy bank is empty =
in the beginning and slowly each cent and dime and quarter adds up and ther=
e is a decent amount of money that can help one in a time of financial need=
.

Just as one may experience some temporary physical disturbance if one st=
ops doing a physical exercise that one does regularly, similarly one may ex=
perience some temporary spiritual disturbance if one stops doing a spiritua=
l exercise (sadhana) that one does regularly. But that is internal. There i=
s no need to fear any "negative energy" coming from the shiva linga into th=
e house (just as no negative energy comes from a treadmill into the house i=
f one stops walking on it everyday).


Having said that, I'll repeat my usu=
al disclaimer in these matters. If one indeed feels some fear or guilt in n=
ot doing any pooja to a shiva linga or an idol, that is enough to cause pro=
blems. Shame, guilt etc affect one internally and that effect sometimes spi=
lls externally. In such a case, better follow the "rules" one fears. Most r=
ules can be dropped as one overcomes fear/shame/guilt associated with them =
and one understands the original purpose and essence of the rules and feel =
genuinely comfortable breaking their superficial parts.
Best regards,

Nara=
simha
