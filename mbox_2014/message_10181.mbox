Hari Om, Lalithaa ji,

If you're looking for only mantra samhita portion of the Vedas, you could
try SAKSIVC (Sri Aurobindo Kapali Sastry Institute of Vedic Culture) books
on each of the Vedas by Dr. R.L.Kashyap. Each of the Veda samhitas
published by SAKSIVC has multiple volumes and maybe you could start by
picking up one, perhaps your svashAkha samhita and then take to others
based on your interest. Dr.Kashyap discusses the esoteric or inner meaning
of the mantras apart from the literal meaning.

Their main website is at http://www.vedah.com/

Kind rgds,
--Praveen R. Bhat
