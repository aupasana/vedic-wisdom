ar all,

What should one do if one develops medically unexplained symptoms =
during sadhana?

I started a second japa purascharana in January this year.=
 I started having palpitations in February. I experience a racing heart rat=
e from 100- 140 beats a minute lasting upto. 30 minutes- these occur random=
ly st both day and while sleeping at night. I initiallyI put it down to wor=
k-related stress but this has continued even after the stressful period has=
 passed. I am a doctor myself and have sought advice from colleagues and un=
dergone some initial tests- all are normal so far.

I am on vacation now an=
d have increased the japa to four hours a day during this time (3 weeks). I=
 would like to continue but want to check this is safe. Should I consider t=
he palpitations to be a normal side-effect of yogic practices and ignore th=
em and just continue the sadhana? Or is it a sign that I should slow down? =
My instinct is to continue. 

Please could you advise.

Thanks,

Aparna</p>=
