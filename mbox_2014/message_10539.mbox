Hi,
As usual Rajarshi has given an inspiring answer to which I can't add mu=
ch. However I do wish to reiterate one point.=C2=A0 
Purusha doesn't really=
 control prakriti in the terms we understand. In fact humans usually don't =
understand anything. 
This 'control' is just a word someone has written so =
that we can have some idea about it. 

The 'harmonious sharing of power flo=
w' which you mentioned are again only some vague definitions for intellectu=
al gymnastics.The Purusha doesnt know of power or flow or harmony. It exist=
s and just manifests. This manifestation is is what you call prakriti. 
The=
 decision which the manifested and unmanifested takes for the completion of=
 certain order or tasks is beyond words or thoughts or description.It is an=
 ocean of magnanimity. We melt like an insignificant particle of dust in th=
is huge fire. As Ramakrishna says "Once a salt doll went to measure the dep=
th of the ocean.."
Intellectual understanding if at all is only a huge detr=
iment in this case. 

In the deepest of silence, when there is no flicker o=
f thought, when even the questions like ''who am I" are killed, manifestati=
on ceases to exist. 
This is not at all an easy state to achieve in my expe=
rience. 
Only then it becomes clear that Maya is nothing but ego, nothing a=
t all exists, this material existence is totally a lie. Till then we only p=
lay mind games.=C2=A0
Very sincerely,S
