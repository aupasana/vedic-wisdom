Dear Puneet,=C2=A0

Kudos to a great mail.
The fact that people who live ab=
road for a longer time discover their Indian roots and gain a better unders=
tanding of its religious, communal and philosophical base is particularly v=
ery true. I understood the various people, customs and dimensions of this v=
ast country only after I went away. Also I had most of my spiritual experie=
nces while living in Germany.

Best regards,

Dear all,
I was trying to forward this mail to Jyotishgroup an=
d it is failing. Sending mail to this group as I think many members are com=
mon
To Kannan ji who took offense at marking to personal id. Try to see car=
efully, mail was sent to jyotishgroup and not delivered, hence i forwarded =
to all members who were in discussion on this topic. You were not exclusive=
ly marked. Next time free to rant but with facts.
Regards
Puneet
Namaste to=
 all,
=C2=A0
Now that result is clear, it is time to make a judgement on pr=
edictions and later few words on Ranter 'Kannan Iyenger'=C2=A0below.
=C2=A0=

1. I tracked most of the astrologers. Almost all were wrong. Many said the=
re is absolutely no chance. And among other's who gave him a chance, they w=
ere also sceptical. Bejan Daruwalla had said there is 54% chance of Modi as=
 PM. Narasimha ji said 60%. These predictions were wrong as 50% chance is f=
or even Mulayam, Mayawati or for that matter anyone contesting. Anyone sayi=
ng above 90-95% may be called correct though with the extent of final victo=
ry, those who said 100% should be considered correct.
=C2=A0
2. I will look=
 for Narasimha Ji's other prediction of political instability over next 2 y=
ears. It does not look true looking at present victory status of BJP/NDA. H=
is statement on AAP's performance in my view is incorrect. Punjab's success=
 (though unexpected a month back)=C2=A0is limited and them losing Delhi mea=
ns spectacular failure. Kejriwal is silent on twitter for last 2 days and t=
o me it shows he is unhappy with performance.
=C2=A0
3. Somebody had commen=
ted on Exit polls being wrong. On the contrary, most were right. Todays Cha=
nakya was right to last digit (291 =C2=B1 14 #Cong 57 =C2=B1 9 #NDA 340 =C2=
=B114 #UPA 70 =C2=B19 Others 133 =C2=B111 Seats). CVoter got vote percentag=
e right (Just 1% variation), not the seat conversion. Even www.5forty3.com =
had predicted 320 seats for NDA and absolute majority for BJP. The only rea=
son other polls were not right to last digit (Even though they got overall =
trend) is because in a 'wave election' it is difficult to get seat conversi=
on right. How will anyone predict 72 seats in UP (Chanakya predicted 70 and=
 had got lot of flak). Overall, exit polls were far more satisfying than mo=
st astrologers
=C2=A0
4. I have a quotation of Swami Vivekananda gifted to =
me by someone "You are the creator of your own destiny". While I do not hav=
e the context of this, Modi has proved this to be true. If he had believed =
in astrologers, he would not have gone on 24th April to file nominations as=
 that was considered a non-auspicious day. But my understanding is that he =
wanted limelight for elections being held on that day and went with that in=
stinct. He got what he wanted and astrologers were proved wrong. Also, when=
 he had setup mission 272, it seemed impossible target (No astrologer backi=
ng too), again he went 'single minded devotion and passion' to=C2=A0what he=
 wanted. Created his own destiny.
=C2=A0
5. Now, on the rants of gentleman =
below. Let me state it with conviction that he seems to be a follower of AA=
P philosophy. No astrological reason but because his followers are perennia=
lly angry, totally selfish and will make big statements without backing tha=
t with action. Following are the issues raised by Kannan in his rants
=C2=
=A0
a) 2002 'Genocide'
=C2=A0
Genocide is a term used for near or total ann=
ihilation of a religious group. Stupid ranters use such strong words when 2=
5% of people who dies in Gujarat riots were 'Hindus'. That when they are 90=
% of population in Gujarat. Many other (Mainly Hindus) have perished in bom=
b attacks & Jehadi actions like Mumbai attacks. A factual description is av=
ailable here http://kiranasis.blogspot.in/2011/09/godhra-train-burning-yet-=
another-rewind.html=C2=A0. However, there will never be end to questions if=
 Modi did enough or not . Kannan ji is free to live in his angry delusions =
forever.
=C2=A0
b) PR machinery like APCO
=C2=A0
Fact 1: Heard Dentsu? It i=
s a PR machinery from Japan who were given 500 cr contract for Rahul's imag=
e. 
Fact 2: Congress spent more money in TV advertising than BJP. 
Fact 3: =
Congress also used Govt money to advertise about schemes and started TV adv=
ertisement months before BJP
=C2=A0
Why did Congress's fail so badly while =
BJP's PR spectacular success? Being from marketing background, I can go in =
deep detail and give you terminologies but I will leave you with the words =
of a man of wisdom which you will need to read many times to understand. 
=
=C2=A0
"First become 'that' & projection happens automatically"
=C2=A0
=C2=
=A0
c) MNC backing & no development
=C2=A0
Corporate backing is clear. No d=
evelopment is a failed argument and I need not give links to prove it. All =
election season we have heard and annihilated all arguments and counter-arg=
uments. I am sure you know those but ranted nevertheless
=C2=A0
Even the ha=
rshest of Modi's critics agree that this man has boundless energy and works=
 very hard. He is techno savvy and visionary. Those who listened to his spe=
ech in Varanasi yesterday would know that he gave the city and country a cl=
eanliness mission for 2019 and tied it to Gandhi's 150th anniversary. That'=
s vision and a way to motivate. 
=C2=A0
d) Hindus sitting outside should no=
t comment
=C2=A0
On the contrary, Hindus when they go outside India redisco=
ver their roots. They also compare with Western progress and want that for =
India. India is a sacred land for all Hindus wherever they may be in world.=
 They have all rights to worry about it as anyone living in India has. Chan=
akya had said the following wise statement thousand of years back and Mr. I=
yenger should read it many times
=C2=A0
"No country is foreign to a man of =
knowledge"
=C2=A0
e) America is devil
=C2=A0
Then stop your usage of Americ=
an inventions. Don't use electricity, Internet, TV, AC etc. Start living in=
 a hut and then preach. It is same kind of rants which Islamists use. They =
want all inventions, all dollars from America but will want it's death.
=C2=
=A0
In reality,=C2=A0it is great that people who understand Dharma are in A=
merica and working to change it from inside. Someday one of them may become=
 it's leader and will change the fate of entire earth. Hindus before 10th C=
entury AD were very enterprising and visited entire globe. Something happen=
ed afterwards and they developed these stupid theories.
=C2=A0
f)=C2=A0 My =
bharat mata needs no one's luck. Sanatan Dharma will protect itself.
=C2=A0=

Your Bharat Mata has been reduced to 10% of it's influence which once spre=
ad from Afghanistan to Indonesia & even exported to China. 30% area has bee=
n cut in last century itself. Hindus & other minorities have been brutally =
annihilated in Pakistan and in Bangladesh. Dharma is in danger inside what =
is remaining. What did your Bharat Mata did?
=C2=A0
Instead of pulling back=
 the one who talks of unity and regaining strength, look at history and lea=
rn. As Narasimha ji once very eloquently said "Even God functions through h=
umans"
=C2=A0
I have met countless Iyers and Iyengers in my life and as a c=
ohesive group, they are among the most intelligent humans on earth. Perhaps=
 generations of devotion to knowledge had an impact at DNA level. But intel=
ligence is not the same as wisdom as I can see now. 
=C2=A0
And someone so =
devoted to rants may be simmering with anger and urge to respond=C2=A0now, =
missing all my points.

 predicted 320 seats for NDA and absolute majo=
rity for BJP. The only reason other polls were not right to last digit (Eve=
n though they got overall trend) is because in a 'wave election' it is diff=
icult to get seat conversion right. How will anyone predict 72 seats in UP =
(Chanakya predicted 70 and had got lot of flak). Overall, exit polls were f=
ar more satisfying than most astrologers</div>


<div> </div>
<div>4. =
I have a quotation of Swami Vivekananda gifted to me by someone "You are th=
e creator of your own destiny". While I do not have the context of this, Mo=
di has proved this to be true. If he had believed in astrologers, he would =
not have gone on 24th April to file nominations as that was considered a no=
n-auspicious day. But my understanding is that he wanted limelight for elec=
tions being held on that day and went with that instinct. He got what he wa=
nted and astrologers were proved wrong. Also, when he had setup mission 272=
, it seemed impossible target (No astrologer backing too), again he went 's=
ingle minded devotion and passion' to what he wanted. Created his own =
destiny.</div>


<div> </div>
<div>5. Now, on the rants of gentleman b=
elow. Let me state it with conviction that he seems to be a follower of AAP=
 philosophy. No astrological reason but because his followers are perennial=
ly angry, totally selfish and will make big statements without backing that=
 with action. Following are the issues raised by Kannan in his rants</div>
=


<div> </div>
<div><b>a) 2002 'Genocide'</b></div>
<div> </div>
=
<div><font color=3D"#990000">Genocide is a term used for near or total anni=
hilation of a religious group. Stupid ranters use such strong words when 25=
% of people who dies in Gujarat riots were 'Hindus'. That when they are 90%=
 of population in Gujarat. Many other (Mainly Hindus) have perished in bomb=
 attacks & Jehadi actions like Mumbai attacks. A factual description is=

this man has boundless energy and works very hard. He is techno savvy and v=

it to Gandhi's 150th anniversary. That's vision and a way to motivate. </fo=
