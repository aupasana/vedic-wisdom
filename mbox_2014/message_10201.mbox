Namasttay Shri Narasimha Ji and Everyone,

[Narasimha P.V.R. Rao [pvr108@...] Sun 3/16/2014 7:32 PM:]
People are so eager to ask questions that sometimes they miss out on the
answer when it actually comes, either from outside or from within!! Don't be
too busy asking all the time. Pause, be CALM and LISTEN carefully, external
voices as well as internal ones. If you don't listen calmly, you may miss
out on most answers! What's the point in asking then? :-)

[Kannan:]
It is indeed a very sharp pick up of a very subtle point. In fact Shri Phil
Ji missed precisely the answer when I had already explained,  that deep
philosophical questions or point is beyond the cause-effect relationship, in
the very first paragraph of my write-up.

However, despite knowing this, I still persisted with re-explanation in a
different manner; So as to enable the intellect to enhance its receptivity
amidst the clouding turbulence of the excited mind.

To realize Truth one needs to be calm, composed and with focused mind under
excellent control of the intellect. However, this ability is not found with
many by default. And for this very purpose, to enhance this intellectual
ability, one is required to undergo Vidya-Sanskaara crudely translated as
"Educational Correction".

My purpose behind encouraging questions is to prevent the "drive to search
truth" from decaying due to non-motivation. If everyone had the ability to
realize Truth on their own, then one never need to go to Gurukula or get
Upadesha from Aachaarya or Guru.

This is another form of a Maaya, wherein, the seeker starts from assuming
that knowledge is outside, and becomes enthusiastic with various questions,
and finally realizes that knowledge is inside with no questions but all
answers and serene peace and calm.

Now, just because knowledge is achieved in calmness does not constitute a
rule to snub all those who are asking questions, eventhough meaninglessly
and in a silly fashion. Because, that is the first starting point. An
experienced Guru never snubs any silly questions. Because, he knows that
once all questions have dried out, the mind will have no more scope for
dancing, and will surrender. Then only true listening starts.

This is a very very subtle point, and I am really not sure, whether I am
effectively able to convey this. Let me repeat. If I have to fill a vessel
with milk, first I have to remove all the rubbish and trash to come out of
it. Then I have to clean the vessel, and then I have to fill it with milk.
In fact, once the vessel is cleaned, there is no need for me even to fill
the milk, because the vessel is already immersed in ocean of milk. What
prevents the milk from moving into the vessel, is the trash filled inside
the vessel.

Now, here comes a very important point. How to drive the trash out of the
vessel? This is where there comes a difference between theoretical
spirituality and pragmatic spirituality.
When a person is throwing questions, he is actually trying to empty out the
trash. So an experienced pragmatic spiritual person will give the seeker the
complete opportunity to exercise all the strength to evacuate the trash.
Once all such trash is out, the seeker surrenders. And that is the precise
point, from where the seeker actually starts "listening". As long as the
questions of seeker are un-attended, under the name of Wise-Snubbing, he
will not be ready to listen. Under such circumstances, what will be the use
of our knowledge when no one is ready to listen?

There is a proverb which says "After the storm, comes the calm." Likewise,
after the storm of questions shooted out, comes the inner tranquility which
readies one for listening. Its like vomiting. When the stomach vomits out
the trash, it gets ready and empty to receive the healthy food, which is
actually the listening. If I ask the person not to vomit, because, food is
taken by receiving(listening) and not by vomiting(asking), then the person
will never ever be able to receive, without first vomiting. And expecting
him to control his vomit, is a torture from the so-called wise people, who
are actually not wise; but afflicted by a subtle form of emotional ego. This
is where Love comes in. This is where Bhakti starts.

Someone said, "When knowledge becomes fully matured, it becomes Bhakti,
Love, Compassion". Shri Krushna taught this to Shri Uddhava, a
Brahmagnyaani, who was afflicted by this subtle ego.All the Bruja-Gopikas
are none but Brahmagnyaani Rishis who took birth to experience Divine Love
of Shri Raadha-Krushna.

Many must be knowing about Shri Krushna-Sudaama friendship, but it is to be
noted that Shri Sudaama was afflicted with subtle ego which none but Shri
Krushna knew.
In fact, this happens to all those knowledgeable people who have not learnt
the meaning of "Bhakti, Love or Compassion", thereby subjecting themselves
to a very subtle form of affliction of an emotional ego. True wisdom cannot
be realized without Love. This is the ultimate secrets of all secrets. Love
alone is the Eternal Truth. This cosmos is held by Love. Love transcends
even Truth and Dharma. I feel lost myself in describing Love. I am
speechless.

In any case, there is another proverb which says " A fool asks more
questions than the wise can answer." But if we want the fool to become wise,
then we have to answer more than the fool has questioned. Then only it will
act as a motivation for the fool to try to become a wise. Otherwise, the
fool will always be happy to remain as a fool, thinking that wise is
"unable" to answer him.

Here, I remember a story from Shri Vasishtha-Vishwamitra tussle. Shri
Vishwamitra severely abused Shri Vasishtha. One of the Rishis asked Shri
Vasishtha, "Why are you allowing Shri Vishwamitra to continue employing all
Divya-astras(divine weapons) against you?" To this, Shri Vasishtha wisely
answered" To give him the opportunity to apply all his strength to empty out
all the trash and ego filled within." And it happened exactly as Shri
Vasishtha envisaged. Rajarshi Kaushika became Brahmarishi Vishwamitra, all
because of Brahmarishi Shri Vasishtha, who gave  Shri Vishwamitra the
opportunity and scope to vomit out the trash. Once everything got emptied,
Shri Vishwamitra was auto-filled with Brahma-Gnyaana and became a
Brahma-rishi.
Had Shri Vasishtha snubbed Shri Vishamitra by giving theoretical advises on
spirituality, then Shri Vishwamitra would have always persisted and be
contented with His Kingship and Kingdom, and would have never ever tried to
become Brahmarishi even in the wildest dream. Such was the wisdom of the
immaculate Brahmarishi Shri Vasishtha.

So, the bottomline is, vomiting(asking) has to precede eating(listening),
for a real digestion(realization) to take place. And to allow the person to
vomit over us requires Love and Compassion of a Mother to her baby. This
also proves that Love precedes Knowledge for a truly wise. And real wisdom
is "Being a Mother", rather than "Being a Father". This is where Guru comes.
A true Guru is a Mother, not a Father, but majestically both. Wow! Who can
describe Guru! It is none the surprise that no one is above The Mother
Divine. All Brahma-Rishis are Mothers.

I conclude this exposition, and thanks to all of you for giving the
opportunity to express and share. Thank You.

Aum Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih

With Kind Regards,
Kannan

 miss out
on the answer when it actually comes, either from outside or from=
 within!! Don't
be too busy asking all the time. Pause, be CALM and LISTEN =
carefully, external
voices as well as internal ones. If you don't listen ca=
lmly, you may miss out
on most answers! What's the point in asking then? :-=
)<br>
<br>
<b><u>[Kannan:]<br>
</u></b>It is indeed a very sharp pick up of=
 a very subtle point. In fact Shri
Phil Ji missed precisely the answer when=
 I had already explained,  that
deep philosophical questions or point =
is beyond the cause-effect relationship,
in the very first paragraph of my =
write-up.<br>
<br>
However, despite knowing this, I still persisted with re=
-explanation in a
different manner; So as to enable the intellect to enhanc=
e its receptivity
amidst the clouding turbulence of the excited mind.<br>
<=
br>
To realize Truth one needs to be calm, composed and with focused mind u=
nder
excellent control of the intellect. However, this ability is not found=
 with
many by default. And for this very purpose, to enhance this intellect=
ual
ability, one is required to undergo Vidya-Sanskaara crudely translated =
as “Educational
Correction”.<br>
<br>
My purpose behind encoura=
ging questions is to prevent the “drive to
search truth” from d=
ecaying due to non-motivation. If everyone had the
ability to realize Truth=
 on their own, then one never need to go to Gurukula or
get Upadesha from A=
achaarya or Guru.<br>
<br>
This is another form of a Maaya, wherein, the se=
eker starts from assuming that
knowledge is outside, and becomes enthusiast=
ic with various questions, and
finally realizes that knowledge is inside wi=
th no questions but all answers and
serene peace and calm.<br>
<br>
Now, ju=
st because knowledge is achieved in calmness does not constitute a rule
to =
snub all those who are asking questions, eventhough meaninglessly and in a
=
silly fashion. Because, that is the first starting point. An experienced Gu=
ru never
snubs any silly questions. Because, he knows that once all questio=
ns have dried
out, the mind will have no more scope for dancing, and will s=
urrender. Then
only true listening starts.<br>
<br>
This is a very very sub=
tle point, and I am really not sure, whether I am
effectively able to conve=
y this. Let me repeat. If I have to fill a vessel with
milk, first I have t=
o remove all the rubbish and trash to come out of it. Then I
have to clean =
the vessel, and then I have to fill it with milk. In fact, once
the vessel =
is cleaned, there is no need for me even to fill the milk, because
the vess=
el is already immersed in ocean of milk. What prevents the milk from
moving=
 into the vessel, is the trash filled inside the vessel.<br>
<br>
Now, here=
 comes a very important point. How to drive the trash out of the
vessel? Th=
is is where there comes a difference between theoretical spirituality
and p=
ragmatic spirituality.<br>
When a person is throwing questions, he is actua=
lly trying to empty out the
trash. So an experienced pragmatic spiritual pe=
rson will give the seeker the
complete opportunity to exercise all the stre=
ngth to evacuate the trash. Once
all such trash is out, the seeker surrende=
rs. And that is the precise point,
from where the seeker actually starts &#=
8220;listening”. As long as the
questions of seeker are un-attended, =
under the name of Wise-Snubbing, he will
not be ready to listen. Under such=
 circumstances, what will be the use of our
knowledge when no one is ready =
to listen?<br>
<br>
There is a proverb which says “After the storm, c=
omes the calm.”
Likewise, after the storm of questions shooted out, c=
omes the inner tranquility
which readies one for listening. Its like vomiti=
ng. When the stomach vomits out
the trash, it gets ready and empty to recei=
ve the healthy food, which is
actually the listening. If I ask the person n=
ot to vomit, because, food is
taken by receiving(listening) and not by vomi=
ting(asking), then the person will
never ever be able to receive, without f=
irst vomiting. And expecting him to
control his vomit, is a torture from th=
e so-called wise people, who are
actually not wise; but afflicted by a subt=
le form of emotional ego. This is where
Love comes in. This is where Bhakti=
 starts.<br>
<br>
Someone said, “When knowledge becomes fully matured=
, it becomes Bhakti,
Love, Compassion”. Shri Krushna taught this to S=
hri Uddhava, a Brahmagnyaani,
who was afflicted by this subtle ego.All the =
Bruja-Gopikas are none but
Brahmagnyaani Rishis who took birth to experienc=
e Divine Love of Shri Raadha-Krushna.<br>
<br>
Many must be knowing about S=
hri Krushna-Sudaama friendship, but it is to be
noted that Shri Sudaama was=
 afflicted with subtle ego which none but Shri
Krushna knew.<br>
In fact, t=
his happens to all those knowledgeable people who have not learnt the
meani=
ng of “Bhakti, Love or Compassion”, thereby subjecting
themselv=
es to a very subtle form of affliction of an emotional ego. True wisdom
can=
not be realized without Love. This is the ultimate secrets of all secrets.
=
Love alone is the Eternal Truth. This cosmos is held by Love. Love transcen=
ds
even Truth and Dharma. I feel lost myself in describing Love. I am speec=
hless.<br>
<br>
In any case, there is another proverb which says “ A =
fool asks more
questions than the wise can answer.” But if we want th=
e fool to become
wise, then we have to answer more than the fool has questi=
oned. Then only it
will act as a motivation for the fool to try to become a=
 wise. Otherwise, the
fool will always be happy to remain as a fool, thinki=
ng that wise is “unable”
to answer him.<br>
<br>
Here, I rememb=
er a story from Shri Vasishtha-Vishwamitra tussle. Shri
Vishwamitra severel=
y abused Shri Vasishtha. One of the Rishis asked Shri
Vasishtha, “Why=
 are you allowing Shri Vishwamitra to continue employing
all Divya-astras(d=
ivine weapons) against you?” To this, Shri Vasishtha
wisely answered&=
#8221; To give him the opportunity to apply all his strength to
empty out a=
ll the trash and ego filled within.” And it happened exactly
as Shri =
Vasishtha envisaged. Rajarshi Kaushika became Brahmarishi Vishwamitra,
all =
because of Brahmarishi Shri Vasishtha, who gave  Shri Vishwamitra the
=
opportunity and scope to vomit out the trash. Once everything got emptied, =
Shri
Vishwamitra was auto-filled with Brahma-Gnyaana and became a Brahma-ri=
shi.<br>
Had Shri Vasishtha snubbed Shri Vishamitra by giving theoretical a=
dvises on
spirituality, then Shri Vishwamitra would have always persisted a=
nd be
contented with His Kingship and Kingdom, and would have never ever tr=
ied to
become Brahmarishi even in the wildest dream. Such was the wisdom of=
 the
immaculate Brahmarishi Shri Vasishtha.<br>
<br>
So, the bottomline is,=
 vomiting(asking) has to precede eating(listening), for a
real digestion(re=
alization) to take place. And to allow the person to vomit
over us requires=
 Love and Compassion of a Mother to her baby. This also proves
that Love pr=
ecedes Knowledge for a truly wise. And real wisdom is “Being
a Mother=
”, rather than “Being a Father”. This is where Guru
comes=
. A true Guru is a Mother, not a Father, but majestically both. Wow! Who
ca=
n describe Guru! It is none the surprise that no one is above The Mother
Di=
vine. All Brahma-Rishis are Mothers.<br>
<br>
I conclude this exposition, a=
nd thanks to all of you for giving the opportunity
to express and share. Th=
ank You.<br>

Aum Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih<br>
