Great Golden Being: An Allegory

There=
 was once a motionless golden being called Brahman. With a big roar, he sud=
denly sprang into action. This great golden being took out tiny pieces of g=
old from himself, moulded them into various shapes and moved them like pupp=
ets, enacting a drama. As one puppet hit another, the latter puppet became =
angry at the former puppet. The great golden being made puppets like and ha=
te other puppets and engage in various actions with others.
He made some fa=
ir rules for the drama. Every puppet received equal and opposite reactions =
for its actions towards other puppets. As he made puppets see others and wi=
sh for several things, he eventually gave them what they wished for, after =
they helped enough in fulfilling the wishes of other puppets. The rules mad=
e the drama engaging, self-sufficient, long and lively.
He occasionally cru=
shed a puppet and made a puppet of another shape with the material and chan=
ged its role in the drama. But he lent some continuity to the drama by enab=
ling that puppet to still get equal reactions to its previous actions and m=
ake it follow its previous desires even without realizing it. However, he m=
ade the puppets unaware of the continuation and made them very very scared =
of being crushed.
He occasionally made a rare puppet finally not fear being=
 crushed, not wish for this or that, do all its actions with no like or dis=
like to other puppets or to actions themselves. He then "freed" it from the=
 drama - he mixed in himself the gold that made the puppet.
He made some pu=
ppets curious to understand the whole drama. After they contemplated enough=
, he even made some "see" everything that happened! But he made them misund=
erstand some details.
Someone thought the original motionless being represe=
nted the pristine state that one should strive to merge into. He did not re=
alize that motionless golden being and animated great golden being were one=
 and the same. Even if one merged into the motionless golden being, that be=
ing would oneday spring into action and become the animated great golden be=
ing!
There were multiple theories on whether a puppet could ever merge in t=
he animated great golden being, whether the puppet would then become a "par=
t" or "full". There came to be varying theories on the relationship and sup=
eriority of motionless golden being and the animated great golden being. Th=
ere were also theories on how the great being suddenly sprang into action f=
rom the motionless Brahman, i.e. what made him do that. Some considered the=
 great being impermanent and Brahman permanent. They did not realize that b=
oth were the same. It was a cycle - the great being was sometimes animated =
and sometimes his animation withdrew and he remained motionless over an ext=
ended period. Both were the same being.
The great golden being made some pu=
ppets speak eloquently about above theories and claim all-knowingly, "whate=
ver I am doing is done by the great being and not by me". Yet, by pulling i=
nvisible strings, great being made them feel internally that they were doin=
g everything! He made them do terrible things to others with vengeance and =
he made them pay for it. He kept remaking them in different forms in the dr=
ama and made them experience various things.
One wise puppet came along and=
 said, "forget all conflicting theories. What matters, O fellow puppets, is=
 to overcome your likes, dislikes, fears etc and participate in the drama w=
ithout getting carried away. Whether you merge in in animated great golden =
being or motionless golden being, whether you become part or full upon merg=
ing, is irrelevant now. What matters now is to work on your individual cond=
itioning and overcome it."
The great golden being of course made that "wise=
" puppet speak those words. He pulled the invisible strings to influence va=
rious puppets variously by those words!------------------------------------=
