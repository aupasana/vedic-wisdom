Dear sir, I am happy to see your exhaustive coverage on this issue. Every o=
ne must understand that Hinduism is not an ism or religion . It is followin=
g the discipline from the Ancient Wisdom or Sanatana Dharma as Sir has expr=
essed. It is not a religion, so the wisdom suits to anyone irrespective of =
caste, creed, religion, nationality. Unless we will be able to see Narayana=
 the indweller in and around us in mineral, plant, animal and human kingdom=
s, we cannot said to have understood the Dharma. Thanks Master.
Balakrishna=
