Thanks for your kind response.

I wish to perform vedic rituals on my own b=
y learning the elaborate procedure, vedic accent pronounciation and meaning=
s (literal, hidden and spiritual) of the vedic mantras. I know it is a time=
 taking and long process, but still I wish to follow this path.
Chanting ve=
dic text is quite different from reading sanskrit stotras. I want to learn =
the proper way of pronouncing the veda mantras (in order to read rudra nama=
kam, chamakam, purushsuktam, srisuktam etc.) considering all the accents. I=
 did some preliminary search in the internet, but could not find a consolid=
ated step by step guide for learning vedic accents pronounciation. If you k=
now any such resource, please refer.  

Thanks & Regards
Amit Agrawal
