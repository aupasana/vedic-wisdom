[vedic-wisdom] Re: Rudram anuvakas





  Tanvir, thought I'd add my two ce=
nts here.

  Rudram has two portions: Namakam and Chamakam. Namakam is Nams=
karas to Rudra the all pervading diety. A part of it says "spare me from yo=
u anger", thus alleviating my troubles and miseries. It also says "Namah Sh=
am Bhavecha, Mayo Bhavecha, Namah Sham Karayacha (Shankarayacha)...", give =
me peace and relief. It is a misplaced notion to think Rudra is destroyer o=
nly.  Not to forget it also says "Name rudraya vishnave mrityurme pahi". 

=
  In chamakam, we pray for Sham cha me, Sudinam cha me, Kamaschame, Neevara=
 schame, Priyangu vaschame, Godhumaschame, Mudgaschame, .... Dhenu, ....(Gi=
ve me peace, good day, fulfill my wishes, paddy, wheat, dals...,  It is obv=
ious Rudraprasna being part of veda would not have recommended Rudra paraya=
na/ abhisheka if Lord Rudra were solely a destroyer. 

  Also, people do no=
t chant Maha Mrityunjaya mantra for no reason when someone's life is in tro=
uble. According to destroyer only notion Rudra should destroy you !!!

  I =
am not an expert on remedies, so please do consult a priest/ pandit good at=
 it. I urge you not to be mislead by "Rudra destroyer only" notions.

    Dear Mr Tanvir,Rudra is a deity who is fiery, angry, tapasvi=
 (intense long duration one pointed focus), full of heat, always ready to f=
ight and destroy, take part in destructive wars, and finally destroy everyt=
hing in this universe that has form. Often this power of Rudra is used by M=
aha-Vishnu in almost all avataras, to destroy tamas or darkness and evil fo=
rces, from time to time. For example, Hanuman was a Rudra-Avatara, when Mah=
aVishnu came as Rama Avatara.Rudra's function is exactly opposite to Prajap=
ati, The Creator of Men and Progeny. So, it will be wrong to say Rudra as C=
reator. He is not Creator, He is Destroyer. The very word "Rudra" means one=
 who makes you cry.Going by above points, I feel in my humble opinion that =
Rudra's Anuvakas cannot be used for growth, prosperity, marriage, progeny e=
tc. But yes, it can be used to destroy all evils in us of 6th and 8th house=
s, and by destruction of evil, perhaps we may encounter prosperity and grow=
th, but Rudra cannot be directly related to growth, rather related to it in=
directly.Yours sincerely,Nathan
