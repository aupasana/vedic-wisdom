Dear Narasimha Rao garu,
Your explanation is excellent. Thanks a lot.

Namaste,
Do deities =
exist as beings separate from us? Yes.
Do deities exist in us as aspects of=
 our own consciousness? Yes.
What then is the link between the two? Let us =
step down to something more earthy to understand this better.

*=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0 *

When I write or say something, does everyone understand the same way=
? Of course not. One may think that I am denying God's existence. One
 may =
think that I am asking to completely surrender to God.

One may think I am =
confused and not making any sense. One may think that I am wise and clarify=
ing subtle concepts. One may think that I am a proud person spreading half-=
baked knowledge. Different people may look at me differently and judge/unde=
rstand my actions, my words, their meanings and their motivation differentl=
y. Sometimes, totally differently. We see such things all the time in life,=
 don't we?

Why does it happen?

*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

When one reads or listen=
s to me, one's mind is aware of some letters or sounds or facial/tonal expr=
essions, etc. These objective sensory perceptions are subjectively interpre=
ted by a mind using its own conditioning. We add meaning to objective senso=
ry experiences by consciously or sub-consciously falling back on lessons fr=
om all experiences in this life and
 previous lives (which are stored in ch=
itta as sub-conscious memories and tendencies).

Of course, I am not saying=
 that what I write/say does not matter. It matters too. But it is just one =
input. The other person's mental conditioning and life experiences are the =
other input. Both inputs together form an impression in the other person's =
mind. Effectively, this creates a character called "Narasimha Rao" in that =
person's mind. Whatever that person thinks of me, favorably or unfavorably,=
 is actually about that character in his own mind and not about me! Similar=
ly, whatever that person learns/understands from my writings is actually fr=
om that character in his own mind and not from me. After all, not everyone =
develops the same understanding by reading what I write.

Of course, as one=
 interacts with me more and more, that character in one's own mind may reso=
nate with me more and more and get closer to the "real me". But it may neve=
r really become
 identical to the real me.


*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

This applies=
 to deities too.

Whether one reads about a deity and thinks of the deity, =
whether one actually had a vision or a dream of the deity, the bottomline i=
s that all that creates a character in one's mind called that deity!!! What=
ever one perceives of that deity is of that character in one's mind and not=
 of the "real deity". Whatever one learns or receives from is from that cha=
racter in one's mind and not from the real deity.

The reason is one's own =
conditioning, which has a fundamental role in
 interpreting, or even constr=
ucting, every experience. It affects one's awareness, understanding and int=
eraction with a deity too. Whatever one is aware of, understands and intera=
cts with, is basically through characters constructed and sustained in one'=
s own consciousness, whether of people like me or deities. As long as there=
 is dense conditioning, it does affect one's experiences. What I say or a d=
eity does is one input, and one's conditioning is the second input. Both to=
gether determine what the character in one's mind, corresponding to me or a=
 deity, says/does.

*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

If you wants to understand me better, =
overcome your conditioning - make it lighter and lighter. Spend more time w=
ith me. Let the "Narasimha Rao" in your mind become a closer reflection of =
me.

Similarly, if you want to benefit from a deity, overcome your conditio=
ning - make it lighter
 and lighter. Spend more time thinking of the deity.=
 Let the deity's conception in your consciousness become a closer reflectio=
n of the deity.

*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

This is why self-control, reduction of co=
nditioning (vasanas) and internal transformation is vital for progress. Wit=
hout it, one with dense conditioning will not make progress even if he sits=
 next to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa everyday or Lord Shiva appears before him =
everyday.

Best regards,
Narasimha
