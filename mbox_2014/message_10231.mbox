*Hello Dear,*



*Once I compiled the usage for various Rudrakshas : (my 2 =
cents - Gurujans
will add more) **---------=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D-----------=
---*
*-*
Two Mukhi Rudraksha

*It is the representation of the Ardhnarishwa=
ra. The Lord Shiva envisaged
in Goddess Parvati, i.e. half Lord Shiva and h=
alf Goddess Parvati. The
result which one can get by worshipping or by wear=
ing the two faced
Rudraksha is happy married & love life.*

*The ruling pla=
net of Two Mukhi Rudraksha is Moon. They effectively control
the malefic ef=
fects of Moon and diseases of the left eye, kidney,
intestines etc. Emotion=
ally, there is harmony in relationships. This bead
helps in developing harm=
onious relationships.*

*Two mukhi rudraksha or Do mukhi rudraksha is very =
effective removing
negative effect of planet moon. The moon is the ruling i=
nfluence and hence
it can greatly help in controlling negative traits like =
anger, frustration
and lack of concentration.*

*Horoscopes in which Moon i=
s in conjunction with Rahu or Saturn shall wear
this rudraksha bead as it s=
trengthen the planet moon , whose power is
reduced by the conjunction of Ma=
lefics. Possessor of this Rudraksha gets
the blessings of Ardhnarishwar, an=
other incarnation of Lord Shiva. It is
very suitable for the devotees of Lo=
rd Shiva and provides them with mental
peace and spiritual progress. The Va=
astu of Two faced Rudraksha signifies
lord Rudra and his consort Parvati. I=
t can effectively be used for
maintaining marital bliss.*


*Vaishanavas re=
gard it as the symbol of lord Vishnu. Thus it is regarded as
sacred by both=
 the sections, the Vaishnavaites and the Shaivates. The
wearer of this Rudr=
aksha gets all his desires fulfilled and he also attains
the peace of mind.=
 This also helps in meditation and attainment of
spiritual merit becomes ea=
sier, if one wears
it.---------=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D--------------**-*


*T=
hree mukhi Rudraksha *


*represents Agni (Fire). Like Agni, which burns an=
d consumes everything,
yet remains pure and full of power, three mukhi Rudr=
aksha purifies a person
from all sins committed in the past. Those sufferin=
g from inferiority
complex or fear or those experiencing self-hatred or men=
tal strain should
use this Rudraksha. It is also effective in removing lazi=
ness and making a
person energetic.. As per Shrimad Deveibhagawat, this Rud=
raksha condones
the sin of performing an abortion. Being Agnisambhoot (prod=
uced from fire),
it is useful in making the soul pure and enables one toliv=
e a life without
guilt.. Padma Puran assigns this Rudraksha to Brahm (the S=
upreme Lord) and
it helps in solving all problems in life and brings in suc=
cess. According
to the old epics, the whole of universe is controlled by th=
e power of
three, particularly by the three stage philosophy of Shaivagam. =
Three mukhi
Rudraksha is the symbolic seed for this aspect.People suffering=
 from any
diseases, weakness, laziness or inferiority complex should wear t=
hree mukhi
Rudraksha. While children below six years can wear one bead, tho=
se above
this age may wear three beads. Adults can wear nine beads of the N=
epal. *
*---------=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D---------------*

*Four mukhi Rudrak=
sha*


*Four mukhi Rudraksha is blessed by Lord Brahma, one of the Gods of =
the
Hindu Trinity and is responsible for creation. He is the abode of knowl=
edge
and creativity. Brahma is also known as Prajapati, Hirangaygarbha,
Bra=
hmanspati or Vishwakarma. A person wearing a four mukhi Rudraksha is
known =
to get shinning intelligent eyes and a balanced mind and he or she
can use =
the power of speech to his/her advantage. This Rudraksha also
absolves the =
person from various sins including sins like killing of humans
and animals.=
Four mukhi Rudraksha gives fame in all the four dishas
(Directions) and is =
suitable for all the four stages of human (celibacy,
family life, detachmen=
t from family or worldly life and finally
renunciation of the world itself =
=E2=80=93 Brahmacharya, Grahsth, Vaanprasth and
Sanyas). Children can wear =
this Rudraksha to improve their concentration in
studies and for better mem=
ory. Excellent testimonials have been received
for this Rudraksha from stud=
ents, teaches and those engaged in mental and
skilled work.*
*---------=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D---------------*


*Five  mukhi Rudraksha *


*The ruling=
 planet is Jupiter. It helps to attain success in all walks of
life and hel=
ps in gaining knowledge, wealth, power and fame. It is also
very often used=
 in the cure of several diseases of lungs, heart and blood.
It is very effe=
ctive in the elimination of your
enemies.---------=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D----=
-----------*


*Six  mukhi Rudraksha *

*Shrimad Devibhagwat assigns the si=
x mukhi rudraksha to Kartikeya. It is
known for refining wisdom, improving =
power of expression and increasing
will power. Using this Rudraksha also pl=
eases the Goddess of wealth,
Mahalakshmi. He remain brave like skand. Is is=
 also known to purify a
person from serious sins committed. Goddess Parvati=
 also blesses the one
wearing six mukhi Rudraksha.*

*Wearer of six mukhi K=
artikeya Rudraksha gets blessed with wealth, health
and happiness. The cont=
rolling planet is Venus, which signifies luxury,
pleasure and comfort in li=
fe. Leaders and actors who have to perform and
give speeches, etc. can deri=
ve benefit by wearing this bead.*
