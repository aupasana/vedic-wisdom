Namaste,

Hinduism can be "practiced" in many ways. But one foremost way is=
 to imbibe its teaching that "vasudhaiva kuTumbakam" (whole world is one fa=
mily) and not look down upon some countries! ;-)

Honestly though, there IS=
 a difference between India and US. Even amid the hustle bustle of big citi=
es, India has some calm energy right under the surface, which is lacking in=
 US. For example, the same state of mind that can be reached in India after=
 meditating for 10 min may take longer in US.

*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *

Some may have incorrect stereotypes of Americans. Mos=
t regular Americans are simple and honest people, who work hard, enjoy life=
 and try to be good to others.

Though some Americans are swayed by materia=
lism, some do believe in God as taught in Abrahamic religions and in a soul=
 that survives body's death and their ideals are not that different from ou=
rs - only the expression is. Only thing is that they mistakenly believe tha=
t anyone not believing in Jesus will go to Hell. Yet, personal freedom is v=
alued highly and nobody interferes in your life. They try to do good to oth=
ers as far as possible and let everyone pursue one's interests, priorities =
and beliefs.

For a practitioner of homam, though, it is difficult in this =
country, as everyone is scared of fire and there are strong regulations.

*=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *


"Practice of Hinduism" mea=
ns different things to different people. It can mean visiting temple every =
week/month, having an idol or pooja room in the house, lighting incense occ=
asionally, saying prayers regularly, doing daily/weekly/monthly rituals, me=
ditating regularly, etc etc.

I never liked the term "Hinduism" - it is not=
 an "ism". I consider myself an adherer of "Sanatana Dharma", the eternal r=
ight path. It is not a monolith, but a collection of paths suitable for dif=
ferent desa-kala-patras and also a framework that defines the absolute and =
relative goals so that one can chart out one's own path based on those goal=
s.

Sanatana Dharma is more about how to think and be, than exactly what pr=
ocedures to follow. It is more goal-oriented than path-oriented. Goals are =
universal and paths are dependent on desa-kala-patra.

By definition, Sanat=
ana Dharma is not more difficult to follow in one place vs another. It has =
a framework that defines the goal(s) and allows one (or one's guru) to defi=
ne one's path based on desa-kala-patra.

In a free country like US, we are =
able to do whatever rituals we want to do. But, even in more restrictive co=
untries, one should be able to follow Sanatana Dharma in whatever way suita=
ble there.

*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *

Some of us who=
 
left India 2 decades back are shocked to see the blatant materialism in 
=
young urban Indians when we visit India. We wonder if we carried an 
older =
India with us here and maintained it here, while India moved 
on..

India i=
s not uniform. Yes, many may have idols in house or light incense sticks or=
 visit temples, but not everyone has a clear understanding of the tenets of=
 Sanatana Dharma and, more importantly, follow them. It seems like many you=
ng Indians are in a hot pursuit of materialism and not grounded in the tene=
ts of Sanatana Dharma.

Bottomline is that modern India is an amalgam of ma=
ny lifestyles, cultures and attitudes. It may not be what one idealizes it =
to be. Similarly, US may not be what one demonizes it to be.

*=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *

Perhaps it is good, after centuries of =
material weakening of India, that young Indians are running after materiali=
sm. This may be important for a resurgence of India in the world. When the =
pendulum swings too much to the other side, it will turn back anyway. The b=
asic tenets of Sanatana Dharma are so deeply ingrained in the ethos and psy=
che of India that it can come back to surface quite quickly, when the pendu=
lum swings back.

> When =
I take part in 'Religion and Spirituality' answers forum at Yahoo.com,
> I =
come across more atheists than pious Christians of West.

Such forums may c=
ontain disproportionate numbers of certain groups. First of all, atheists a=
re a minority in US. Second of all, being an atheist isn't too bad. Swami V=
ivekananda wrote, "if there is a God, we must see him; 
if there is a soul =
we must perceive it; otherwise it is better not to 
believe. It is better t=
o be an outspoken atheist than a hypocrite."

Most
 atheists and agnostics =
I have met in US are basically good and sincere 
people who mind their busi=
ness, try to be good to others. Above all, 
they have a good sense of right=
 and wrong in what they do to others. 
That's the main thing! Many selfish =
crooks may be god-fearing and yet not have that.

*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *

One needs to be like a water drop on a lotus leaf,=
 whether in India or US, in a village or a city, in Heaven or Hell, in mona=
stery or family life. Never think that you are in a great place and hence n=
o need to be like a water drop or lotus leaf.

A monk in a monastery atop a=
 pious hill in India may become attached to, and proud of, his "detached li=
festyle as a monk" and hence get stuck. A prostitute in an inner city in US=
 may develop detachment, surrender and selflessness and engage in her work =
with no pride or shame and as respectful and loving offering to god in the =
form of her customers, and become liberated.

*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *

What actions we perform may be constrained by our des=
a-kala-patra. But the attitude and spirit with which we perform them is upt=
o us. Sadhana is all about perfecting that - it is not about performing dif=
ferent actions or actions not possible for our desa-kala-patra! It is about=
 transforming and perfecting our attitude and spirit.

Best regards,
Narasi=
