I am trying to understand POV of Shri Narsimhaji=C2=A0 and if i am going ri=
ght then my conclusion is that there is no existence of God in other word i=
ts all about great qualities that people worshiping in the disguise of god.=
 There is no god who can do miracle over night but the perception that chan=
ges overnight in the reaction of a major action. Dashavatars of shri hari V=
ishnu never actually happened on the earth they are teachings in the form o=
f symbolic stories.

>From my observation and experiences i am summing up th=
at
True god is within us, its our soul. pure thoughts good behavior is god.=

Karma done by such thoughts and behavior=C2=A0 in most adverse circumstanc=
es leads toward moksh.
Moksh is defined as merger of soul with god nd end o=
f karma but if you are able to do good karma in any situation you achieve t=
he level of god, ability of god.

Ability of god is infinite so god can do =
anything thus moksha is not end of karma but ability of God.

Please correc=
t me if I am wrong

kind regards
Ashish

Of

a=

Contemplating the greatness or qualities of Saturn or othe=

difficult (e.g. li=
beration). So it may seem like I am not getting any 
result (because I am m=
aking slow progress on a long path). Or I
 may want something simple, but i=
t may not be granted as it is against
 something else I asked for before (a=
nd which is on its way already).<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none"></div=
