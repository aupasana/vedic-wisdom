this is about something else but still important.... could the wiser ones
please explain why there is a proliferation of sri vidya...as if every one
could learn and master that vidya!..or any other vidya!....its truly sad to
see sri vidya being taught in a commercial manner.....today initiation is
available to anyone willing to pay a few 100 bucks?....is this what hindu
tantra is going to become in the coming years???

are not the seekers aware of the profundity of these practices?...if the
wiser ones don't advice the seekers they are going to be fooled with a
dozen fake guru's who use the word vidya and teach nothing much at
best......but which could retrograde the seekers at worst!...

please do something!...before hindu tantra becomes nothing but a vague
memory!!!!
