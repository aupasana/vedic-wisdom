There are two perspectives on theory of Karma. One is, taking it literally
=
that our current situation is because of our past life karma and whatever
w=
e are doing currently is either adding up(by bad karma) that karma or
dimin=
ishing it (by good karma). Second interpretation is, the intellectual
class=
 supporting theory of karma because they thing that this sense of
being pun=
ished for wrong doings creates fear in common people to refrain
from wrong =
doings.

Now while the first one belongs to hard core belief that one will =
be
punished in either this life or the other for the wrong doings. The seco=
nd
perspective is fallible. People may fall prey to maya and actually commi=
t
wrong doings.

Therefore it is important to illustrate the theory of Karm=
a. Shani-dev is
kaarak of karma, is the reason for your birth in this life.=
 The placement
of Saturn in your birth chart indicates area of life that ne=
eds to be
worked upon and the ones that will be punished in your life. The =
whole
system of astrology is based on theory of Karma. And yes, you can see=
 it
working through vedic astrology.

There are divisional charts D-60 in a=
strology that indicate past life karma
of yours, your mother(D-40), your fa=
ther (D-45). There are cases when
person was found to have phobia related t=
o certain things like height or
water or pointed weapons. and using these c=
harts, one can identify the
(death, death-like experiences) reasons for suc=
h phobia.

Now those who are wretched and remain so throughout their life w=
ere
actually destined for this. You would see many examples, where a person=

born in poor family rises up to become very rich whereas other siblings
be=
come nothing. And if you give them money to start business then also they
w=
ill throw it in bad addictions and live in that wretched state always.

You=
 will ask, so is everything destined and there is no free will ? Answer
is =
yes. It is programmed, destined and illusion of somebody having
free-will i=
s also destined.

Mantras, Havans, Japas are external activities. These ext=
ernal activities
should ignite internal Agni within you so that you can ove=
rcome the
situation. Agni is meant to purify and transform. It will reduce =
the Tamas
and increase Sattwa within you. And if, these external activities=
 does not
ignite that internal Agni within you then even if you burn whole =
world's
grains in Homam, it will not give results.
