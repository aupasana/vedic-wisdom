Sri Narasimha Ji , Namaste, 

Is Omkara/pranava upaasana(with extended pron=
unciation OOOOO UUUU MMMM  without any mantras) prohibited for married pers=
ons? 

I have heard this statement in one of the Sri Chaganti lectures but =
I see this done on mass basis at spiritual sessions , like Art of living cl=
asses. It seems this done in sync with inhale+retain+release of air , like =
pranayama.

If banned, what is the equivalent/alternative for Grihasta?
wit=
h panchakshari? with ganesha ?

If not banned, any specific cautions are ne=
eded ? 

Is pranava upaasana meant for general overall spiritual energy/hea=
ling or any tangible/targeted goal?

Perhaps a dumb question but just curio=
us. Please clarify.

regards,
Ramesh
