It is valid to say that one gets blessings of a deity through deit=
y's krupa (kindness and compassion). But then, why do you need a "technicia=
n" and "mediator" to apply for the "kindness and compassion" of Almighty go=
d??? Why cannot one directly interact with the kind and compassionate deity=
, without a "mediator" in between?
 
*        *        *
 
Regarding whethe=
r the result is from the priest's account or deity's account, both viewpoin=
ts are correct in their own way. Let me elaborate.
 
Deities are present in=
 microcosmic form in everyone. When one prays to a deity and contemplates o=
n the deity's nature and qualities, an interaction occurs between one's con=
sciousness and the *microcosmic* representation of the deity within one's c=
onsciousness (which is identical to the [macro]cosmic deity!). A tangible r=
esult - material or spiritual - may occur as a result.
 
One can say that i=
t is bestowed by the deity's krupa. One can also say that a veil in one's c=
onsciousness has been removed, allowed one to interact with the microcosmic=
 representation of the deity and get some shakti (from the deity). Whether =
you say that one has accumulated shakti now or it is god's shakti is a matt=
er of terminology. Bottomline is that one could not access that shakti earl=
ier (due to dense impurities in one's consciousness that blocked one's cons=
ciousness from interacting with the microcosmic representation of deity wit=
hin one's consciousness). With sadhana, those impurities were removed and o=
ne could access the shakti. As simple as that. BTW, one may look at the wor=
d "shakti" in an egoistic way, but shakti comes with humility and purity. S=
hakti is almost synonymous to purity.
 
Now, the same holds for a priest. J=
ust because one is born in a specific family, learnt to repeat a few senten=
ces and a few actions, one's consciousness does not automatically have an o=
pen access to the microcosmic representation of the deity within it. One is=
 born with the same kind of veil and needs to be develop purity to remove i=
t. In the old days, most people from the priestly class were very pure and =
had a free access to the divinity within them. Unfortunately, though I have=
 seen excellent priests, they are a very very small minority today.
 
*    =
    *        *
 
One can disagree with me, but cannot change the facts on t=
he ground. Remedies done by most people with blind faith in priests do not =
work. As a result, generation after generation is losing faith in god, in s=
anatana dharma and in remedies. The current sorry state of sanatana dharma =
cannot be improved by sticking to the letter (of orthodoxy) and ignoring th=
e spirit (of shastras).
 
If people directly put faith in god (instead of p=
riests), surrender to god and do small amount of sadhana themselves, they w=
ill get better results. If more and more people (possibly laymen) do safe a=
nd effective spiritual sadhanas such as homam and start to see the material=
 and spiritual benefits, I am confident that eventually faith in god and sa=
natana dharma will be improved in the coming generations.
 
The proof of th=
e pudding is in eating it. If you do a sadhana or remedy, there must be som=
e tangible result. Either you get a desired goal or something related ot yo=
u see a significant transformation in your attitude and thinking, or some s=
uch clear result.
 
In their first meeting, do you know what Swami Vivekana=
nda told his foremost disciple Sister Nivedita? He said, "religion is not a=
 matter of faith. It is a matter of experience." 
 
*        *        *
 
>=
 WE, the jIvAs are not beggars but anshA of GOD. ????? ???????
 
Well, if, =
as you said, results are bestowed essentially due to the kindness and compa=
ssion (krupa) of god, what is wrong in becoming a beggar for them? Begging =
strangers on the street for a dollar and begging god for his "krupa" are no=
t the same and so don't look at the word beggar with contempt.
 
*        *=
        *
 
> It seems Narsimhji is in too much hurry to spread concept of =
homa in this
> world. Yes, as this concept is blessed by divine mother homa=

 this blessing
 
Well, this body will not last forever. While it lasts, we =
should do the job assigned to us in this life. If hurry is justified at all=
, it is justified in fulfilling one's dharma in the universe. Results are n=
ot in our hands, but actions ARE. There should be NO compromise in performi=
ng dharmik actions.
 
World is at a very delicate stage now and the next te=
n years are crucial. Ten innocent and sincere sadhakas doing sadhana today =
is more useful for dharma than thousand such sadhakas doing sadhana fifty y=
ears later!

Narasimha
