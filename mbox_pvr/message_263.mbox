Namaste Sir,
 
> > But What a real spiritualism is still yet to defined....=

 
I will try more. But first I want to recommend a couple of books:
 
(1) =
"Yoga Vaasishtham" is undoubtedly one of the best works available to a spir=
itually inclined person with interest in vedanta. It is a practical book wi=
th many stories (unlike most dry vedanta books) and teaches profound lesson=
s through stories.
 
Interestingly, I am typing this on the eve of Sree Ram=
a Navami (by the way, happy Sree Rama Navami to all of you!). When Maharshi=
 Vishwamitra came to request Dasaratha to send Lord Rama with him to protec=
t his yajna from demons, Dasaratha was hesitant and Lord Ramachandra was co=
nfused. At the request of Maharshi Vishwamitra and others, Maharshi Vasisht=
ha taught Lord Ramachandra the essence of the knowledge of Self, in front o=
f other maharshis, kings and gods. These teachings were captured by Maharsh=
i Valmiki as the book "Yoga Vaasishtham".
 
This work helped even maharshis=
 like Bharadwaja to obtain Brahma jnana. When Valmiki explained Vasishtha's=
 teachings to Bharadwaja, he became realized.
 
There is a truly inspired E=
nglish translation by Swami Venkatesananda, a disciple of Swami Sivananda o=
f Hrishikesh (Divine Life Society). Swami Sivananda is considered by some t=
o be a re-incarnation of Maharshi Vasishtha.
 
http://www.amazon.com/Vasist=
has-Yoga-Venkatesananda/dp/0791413640
 
This is the best book I have read i=
n my life and I can say this is the book that influenced me the most and ch=
anged my thinking.
 
(2) Bhagavad Gita is a marvelous compendium on practic=
al spirituality. It covers various paths like jnana yoga, raja yoga, bhakti=
 yoga, karma yoga, sannyasa yoga etc. While there are many commentaries and=
 translations, I prefer the treatment of Sant Jnaneshwar. He is a rare Kris=
hna bhakta who is also associated with the path of aghora and nathas! While=
 most Krishna bhaktas follow dwaita and vivishtaadwaita, Jnaneshwar's treat=
ment is purely adwaitic.
 
In Yoga Vasishtham, Vasishtha tells Rama that Vi=
shnu would appear as Krishna in a later yuga and teach the essence of Veda =
to Arjuna. Vasishtha goes to great lengths on what Krishna teaches. Some mo=
dern commentaries on Bhagavad Gita deviate from the adwaitic principles of =
vedanta and interpret some teachings of Krishna in a way that contradicts V=
asishtha's take. Sant Jnaneshwar's interpretation is consistent with Vasish=
tha's and also consistent with upanishads and vedanta.

> > But What a real spiritualism is still yet to defined....
 =

Self-realized person is one who has realized that all is Brahman and not b=
ound by any limited ego, even though actions continue to spring from a prev=
iously existing ego (that continues to wind down like a fan after electrici=
ty is turned off).
 
Spiritual person is one who is making *some progress* =
towards becoming a self-realized person at a point in future.
 
*        * =
       *
 
Unfrotunately, scriptures can describe a self-realized person an=
d how he thinks, but they cannot give any fool-proof steps which, when foll=
owed by one, can ensure self-realization.
 
Just thinking "all is Brahman" =
and understanding it *intellctually* is not sufficient. Let me drive my poi=
nt home using an analogy.
 
Suppose someone goes to a movie and becomes so =
involved in the movie that he behaves as through something is really happen=
ing on the screen. For example, suppose there is a scene where the heroine =
is in a dark room and villain is about to stab her in the back from behind =
her. Suppose there is tense music. One may be shuddering with expectation. =
One may jump with shock and tension.
 
There may be one person who complete=
ly realizes that this is just an illusion and nothing is actually happening=
 and watches it without any emotional involvement whatsoever. He is anlogou=
s to a realized person. Suppose someone is so involved and shouts with happ=
iness when something good happens in the movie and shudders when something =
terrible happens in the movie. He is analogous to a person deeply stuck in =
maya. Really speaking, this life we live is quite similar to a big movie, e=
xcept that it is interactive. Thus, my analogy is quite appropriate.
 
Now,=
 one smart person may very well know that this movie thing is not really ha=
ppening and hence controlling emotions mostly. But an odd scene may make hi=
m shudder too! Such a person is analogous to one who intellectually underst=
ands and appreciates the essence of Veda (that all is Brahman and the objec=
ts we see are all an illusion) and yet does not fully comprehend it.
 
If o=
ne fully realizes, then nothing should make one happy or sad internally. On=
e may act externally as though one is happy or sad, but the heart should be=
 stable always and not excited or depressed by *anything*. If all is Brahma=
n, why should anything exicte you depress you? In our analogy, such a perso=
n is like one watching the movie with zero involvement, realizing at all ti=
mes that it is only imaginary and not happening for real and not being shak=
en even once. One who has only an intellectual understanding and not a comp=
lete understanding may some times be affected by the illusion.
 
If someone=
 praises you, does it excite you? If someone humiliates, does it upset you?=
 If something seems nice, do you want to have it? If something seems disgus=
ting, do you want to go away?
 
As long as there is attachment and self-ide=
ntification with a body or a name or some other limited object, some ego re=
mains and causes all of the above. It results in happiness on some events a=
nd sadness on some events. Self-realization cannot come without overcoming =
ego *fully*. It never comes from an intellectual understanding of the dictu=
m "all is Brahman". It comes from experiencing it.
 
*        *        *
 
=
How can one go from a limited ego to zero ego? There is no single path. As =
I said already, scriptures only describe how a realized person thinks, but =
they cannot give a fool-proof path to realization.
 
However, some scriptur=
es do outline some paths for reference. While they are not fool-proof and d=
o not guarantee realization, they can be helpful.
 
One person may sit down=
 in seclusion in a forest or in Himalayas or a remote cave and keep eating =
enough to just survive and actively contemplate all the time "Who am I? Am =
I this body? Who am I? What are all these objects I perceive? What is all t=
his?" and eventually realize Self. This is jnana yoga.
 
One person may pra=
y to a specific deity and slowly force oneself to see the entire universe a=
s another form of that deity and see that deity in everything. One may even=
tually realize Self through that deity. This is bhakti yoga.
 
One person m=
ay consider work and service as god and spend all of one's time serving peo=
ple without prejudices, without any self-pride and without any selfish moti=
ves. One may try to see god in all people and all service and may eventuall=
y realize Self. This is karma yoga.
 
One person may use forceful methods o=
f raja yoga, control the body, senses and mind through yogic practices, for=
cefully raise self-awareness (Kundalini shakti) to higher realms of conscio=
usness. They too may eventually realize Self.
 
In each of these four broad=
 paths, there are many sub-paths. But please realize that no path guarantee=
s self-realization. They help, but do not guarantee anything. And the only =
method of spiritual progress, IMHO, is how much ego has been overcome.
 
Mo=
st people stick to one method. There are exceptions like Ramakrishna Parama=
hamsa who tried each path and succeeded. In fact, I believe the logo of Ram=
akrishna mutt employs symbols of each of these paths in it! While each sain=
t is great and one cannot compare them, Ramakrishna was somebody else. His =
lila (play) cannot fully be understood by most people even today, after suc=
h a long time. His lila may in fact continue to play out long after he left=
 the body.
 
*        *        *
 
I just want to share my personal view on=
 the link between the abobe paths and Jyotish. This is not from any classic=
 and based on my own intuition.
 
The path of karma yoga is seen from the e=
lement of earth. The path of bhakti yoga is seen from the element of water.=
 The path of jnaana yoga is seen from the element of fire. The path of raja=
 yoga is seen from the element of air. Of course, ether is in all. Ether or=
 space is the basis of all yoga.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>There may be one person who comp=
letely realizes

person. Suppose someone is so involved and shouts wi=
th happiness when something 
good happens in the movie and shudders when so=
mething terrible happens in the 
movie. He is analogous to a person deeply =
stuck in maya. Really speaking, this 
life we live is quite similar to a bi=
g movie, except that it is interactive.
