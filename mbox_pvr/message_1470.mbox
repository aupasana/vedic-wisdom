Namaste,

Praana is the movement in consciou=
sness that sustains the lifeforce. Apaana is the downward force. When one a=
ttains a perfect focus on a mantra and distracting thoughts cease, praana m=
oves downward from lungs/stomach and apaana moves upward. After praana and =
apaana combine, they can move upward at a rapid speed.
=C2=A0
When praana a=
nd apaana combine for the first time, it may feel like an explosion within =
one. As praana moves up, it will feel like one is freed from the body and o=
ne does not exist. This is similar to death, except that there is fear and =
confusion at death and one may feel a kind of bliss when this happens durin=
g meditation. However, if one's focus on mantra relaxes and one become "awa=
re of" the experience and starts analyzing it with the rational mind, there=
 is a chance of one becoming worried and confused. So one should sustain th=
e state where there is full focus on mantra and no other distractions, for =
as long as possible.
=C2=A0
These things happen automatically without think=
ing about them and engaging in any specific practicies. In fact, thinking a=
bout them, desiring them and doing specific practices may become an obstacl=
e and delay things. If you surrender to a deity and do a mantra with a high=
 level of focus, that is enough. Do NOT run after any experience and think =
of an experience as an end result. The focus should be mantra and mantra al=
one.
=C2=A0
Even when an experience occurs, I tell people to not be tied to=
 it and not think too much about it.
=C2=A0
Suchaka dream is a vision of so=
mething that is going to happen.

Re: Resolving Points)

=C2=A0
Dear Narasimha,
=C2=A0
When the sadhaka effac=
es his own personality such that the deity of the mantra comes and occupies=
 him, then at that stage there is 
no real difference between the sadhaka a=
nd the Deity(even if the deity is with the sadhaka all day I would say that=
 there is no real difference).
The difference that one feels is as follows:=

One feels a strange coolness on the skin and on the eyes.
A few repitition=
s of the mantra bring about a situation where the deity possesses the sadha=
ka and the sadhaka's prana goes upward very quickly( Urdhwa Retas), 
During=
 all meditation the sadhaka sees the feet or clothes or hands or face, etc =
of the deity sitting beside him along with minute details of the room (even=
 though the sadhak's eyes are closed).
The sadhak typically becomes dreamle=
ss except for suchaka dreams.
The whole day the sadhaka behaves like a love=
 lorn person. How can i again experience the Beloved.
That then is the expe=
rience of mantra when it is done correctly.
When the sadhak's personality i=
s effaced such that the deity's personality sits there then the sadhak expe=
riences himself as that Deity(Devata) .
There then arises no difference in =
the sadhak or the deity commanding a certain thing to happen( be it what ap=
pears to be good or be it that which appears to be bad) . The deity's perso=
nality is crucial. Ugra devatas make the person care almost for nothing him=
self, so self identification is minimised and the person's spiritual evolut=
ion continues.
Remember, there is=C2=A0very little=C2=A0according to me whi=
ch is black magic. It is all a use of Shakti. If your Shakti and deity is a=
 higher shakti such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then=
 your power will be that of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana). After =
the death of the body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the deity or if he=
 was originally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm reserved for thes=
e beings. 
Attacking such a sadhak brings the full bearing of karma onto th=
e heads of the attackers and some people may realise this to their detrimen=
t( Patan comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Patan with his Shakt=
i causing an earthquake). Some people may even equate this with black magic=
. Here there is only action and reaction.(Bit like you attack a normal pers=
on, and you will get a result of this from that same Atma whom you harmed m=
aybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack somebody who is identifying=
 with the universe and has very few karmas left, then the Universe itself a=
ttacks you, because your attack is not on the sadhaka, but on his identific=
ation, ie God or the universe).
If people persist in using the Shakti posse=
sed by a small Pisacha, Bhuta, then there is only a little Shakti which can=
 be used, moreover=C2=A0then their minds and intellects will not be free of=
 identification with the body and so their actions are those which are gene=
rally termed as black magic. These people usually join the same spirits whi=
ch they have been using after death, this is not an enjoyable experience.
I=
magine if somebody is worshipping Chandika for a few lifetimes, then even i=
n this birth he or she is drawn to that deity and such a sadhak may acheive=
 after a few repitions of a mantra(because of his previous effort).
On the =
other hand somebody doing this mantra only in this lifetime may feel that t=
he 64 things which bind every mantra are crucial and may not acheive in thi=
s lifetime.
According to me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so l=
et me suggest an easy sadhana.
If one is so inclined, then starting on some=
 good day, do 1000 reititions of the Savitri(some=C2=A0call this the=C2=A0G=
ayatri, but the real Gayatri is hidden) every day, main constraints
Same ti=
me every day.
Same place.
Same materials.
Same direction.
As little movemen=
t as one can.
Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.
Complete =
restraint on sex(from the mind and the body, not just the body), reduce foo=
d intake, grow a beard.
Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your b=
owels are empty before you start.
Continue this for 100 days and do this wh=
ole procedure 3 times.
See the difference in your personality before and af=
ter.
Long and short , what is important is that life may be short, so do so=
me sadhana, and persist with that sadhana for as long as is physically poss=
ible.
I hope this clarifies some of the concepts which were being discussed=
.
=C2=A0

I mentioned the above with respect to the need of thousands=

of mantras and umpteen technicalities are for commanding thousands of diffe=
rent results from god. That is why I talked of commanding vs begging. Howev=
er, this commanding works slightly differently than one may imagine. I will=
 elaborate.
=C2=A0
Also, commanding god is NOT black magic. Commanding low =
level beings is black magic, which can be accomplished even by a person not=
 quite elevated spiritually and suffering from a heavy ego. However, comman=
ding higher beings such as gods is possible only for a spiritually=C2=A0ele=
vated person with no or extremely small ego. This commanding that I am refe=

it. Only a person succeeding in completely effacing individual ego can achi=
eve this commanding! I will repeat something from the previous mail to clar=
ify:
=C2=A0

The universe has many lokas (planes of consciousness) , many b=
eings and many objects. There are infinite karmic interactions possible bet=
ween them. Accordingly, there are infinite possible mantras. When one is ab=
le to perfectly control the mind and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoug=
hts but the mantra reverberating in the mind constantly), then one experien=
ces the mantra. This perfect absorption=C2=A0of self-awareness in the mantr=
a then causes internal changes by the flow of energy internally in specific=
 ways (specific to the mantra) and that causes corresponding external chang=
es in the universe and corresponding karmic interactions between various ob=
jects.
=C2=A0
Each set of "karmic interactions between various objects" is =
a "result". Various mantras are for various "results". One may term merging=
 self-awareness in a mantra fully and getting a specific result from it as =
"commanding a result" from god. Whether you like the term or not, it is ess=
entially that.

But the bottomline is this: O=
nly a highly purified sadhaka of very low ego can command specific results =
from god (not for selfishness or even ego satisfaction, but acting as an un=
attached=C2=A0instrument of Nature fulfilling one's dharma set by Nature). =
Various mantras and technicalities of mantra shastra taught by rishis are m=
eant for such sadhakas.
=C2=A0
Those are hardly of use to so many people ou=
t there with dense egos seeking specific selfish results. They cannot comma=
nd specific results from god (because of their heavy attachment to the resu=
lt, which is in turn due to their own attachment to a limited ego), even if=
 they use all the techniques of mantra shastra and all the associated rules=
 of astrology. Instead of wasting their time with these technicalities, the=
y will be better off learning to be good beggars at God's door.
=C2=A0
Just=
 pick any prasiddha mantra or a mantra you feel attracted to, without worry=

=C2=A0
Keep praying every day or every =

=C2=A0
Even when you encounter a pe=

You can do anyday. Parasara does not mention any day for doing ho=

In fact, if one wants, one can do a homam or worship=

Parasara's definition of gandanta is restricted to two nei=

 different teachings of Parasara (bhava karakas and special lagnas). I do n=

Dear Sanjay,
=C2=A0

=C2=A0
I do have a definition of gand=

=C2=A0
Since some of you are =
extrapolating it based on the fire embodied in UL and water embodied in tit=
his, the onus is on you to outline and justify=C2=A0your definition. I got =
into this thread because statements were made that fasting on particular we=

and "danger to spouse", based on these far-fetched extrapolations of gandan=
ta.
=C2=A0

=C2=

Well, you once taught that houses represent Sun/Shiva/truth and arudhas=
 represent Moon/Gouri/percepti on. That was meaningful. Now, you associated=
 UL, an arudha, with Sun and fire and 12th, a house, with Gouri and water. =
I question whether the new theory on fasting is really in line with everyth=
ing you have learnt (and taught).
=C2=A0
BTW, I specifically asked for a cl=

=C2=A0
First of all, Parasara d=
id *not* prescribe fasting on specific weekdays or tithis based on any arud=
has or houses in a chart.
=C2=A0
For doshas in birth chart or to get relief=
 from planetary afflictions or to get the blessings of planets, he suggeste=
d various *homas* (fire rituals) and described how to perform them. His sec=
tion on remedial measures is full of various homas. I am not dismissing tho=
se remedies taught by Parasara himself and I am in fact slowly preparing ma=
nuals on them so that anybody can do them by themselves.
=C2=A0
Parasara di=
d *not* specify the weekday or tithi for most of these homas (e.g. planetar=
y homas). Only for homas for specific birth doshas (e.g. Amavasya dosha or =
Moola dosha), he fixed the tithi or nakshatra based on the dosha and the de=
ity. But the days are not based on any house or arudha in the chart.
=C2=A0=

Thus, the principles I am questioning are *not* from Parasara.
=C2=A0
Seco=
nd, I said what I said in a *context*. People are mentioning complicated pr=
inciples that are not found in classics or works of rishis and scaring peop=
le that performing austerities such as fasting on certain days cause "dange=

point is that it is smaller compared to the difference between doing and no=
t doing at all and that doing it on=C2=A0a "wrong day" does not cause dange=
r as being suggested.
=C2=A0
Third, our shastras primarily talk about worsh=
ipping various deities on various days, based on the energy of the *deity*.=
 For worshipping a certain deity, certain tithi or weekday or nakshatra is =
better than others. This is based on the deity and irrespective of the pers=
on worshipping. Let me give an analogy. If a rich man comes out with more m=

=C2=A0
I did not say it is "=
useless". Instead, I suggest that our ability to use it is limited and we s=
hould take our limitations into consideration.
=C2=A0
The universe has many=
 lokas (planes of consciousness) , many beings and many objects. There are =
infinite karmic interactions possible between them. Accordingly, there are =
infinite possible mantras. When one is able to perfectly control the mind a=
nd *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but the mantra reverberating i=
n the mind constantly), then one experiences the mantra. This perfect absor=
ption=C2=A0of self-awareness in the mantra then causes internal changes by =
the flow of energy internally in specific ways (specific to the mantra) and=
 that causes corresponding external changes in the universe and correspondi=
ng karmic interactions between various objects.
=C2=A0
However, this variet=
y of mantras, experiences and results is irrelevant to one who does not hav=
e such perfect control over the mind to absorb the mind fully in a mantra. =
It is relevant only to a seer whose self-awareness is quite evolved and hen=
ce control over mind impeccable. Such seers are extremely extremely rare to=
day. Most people are unable to experience any mantra and mantras do not=C2=
=A0work for them as they are supposed to.
=C2=A0

=C2=A0
Jus=
t repeating a combination of sounds does not guarantee anything. Some peopl=
e may think that certain results come when they repeat a mantra certain num=
ber of times. That is an incorrect notion. A mantra may work for one person=
 quickly and another may spend the whole life chanting it and nothing may h=

=C2=A0
A highly learned scholar in the court of a king may be a=
ble to command the king and get whatever he wants from king. An incapable o=
ne is better off begging the king, rather than trying to command (and faili=
ng for sure).
=C2=A0
Similarly, most people are better off begging god for =
what they want rather than trying to use the right mantra to command what t=
hey want. A beggar does not need a huge vocabulary or great scholarship or =
knowledge. Feeling of humility and helplessness, surrender, patience and=C2=
=A0persistence are what help a beggar succeed. A beggar needs the right att=
itude rather than knowledge. In this age and time, best bet for most people=
 is to learn to be a good beggar at god's door.
=C2=A0
What people today ne=
ed for material and spiritual progress through remedial measures is a bette=
r attitude in begging god rather than a better choice of tools such as mant=
ras and other specifics such as weekday, tithi etc to command a specific re=
sult from god.
=C2=A0
It is worth noting that so many great spiritual teach=
ers who came in the last century or two did not emphasize picking the right=
 mantra based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasized having the correct=
 attitude - surrender, submission, devotion, patience, persistence, discipl=
ine, humility etc.=C2=A0*That* is a lot more important and useful than tryi=
ng to be oversmart with the choice of mantra, day etc and impress god.

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
One more thing. We have many mantras given by r=
ishis, but=C2=A0the guidelines from rishis like Parasara on how to pick a m=
antra based on the horoscope are very limited. Astrologers today do not ope=
rate solely based on them. They use all kinds of other rules coming from va=
rious traditions. They are not free from corruption and imperfection. Most =
scriptures associate various mantras with various results, irrespective of =
horoscope. For example, irrespective of who is the 6th lord and 8th lord an=
d lord of A6 and A8, Rina Vimochaka Angaraka mantra is good for debt contro=
l. And so on. Linking of horoscope is overplayed by today's astrologers, wa=
y beyond the scope of Parasara's guidelines.
=C2=A0
If one has a sadguru, I=
 recommend following the word of sadguru rather than that of an astrology t=
heoretician.
=C2=A0
If not, there is no foolproof way to know the right pat=
h. Pick any path (given by an astrologer or one that you feel attracted to)=
 instead of wasting time and then keep working on your attitude. The latter=
 is the key. As I said earlier, learn to be a humble beggar at god's door. =
Choice of Mantra is secondary and attitude is primary. If you succeed in be=
ing a really humble beggar, you stand a better chance of success than great=
 scholars.
=C2=A0

Any prasiddha mantra (e.g. ashtakshari, panchakshari, dw=
adasakshari, navakshari, vishnu sahasranaam, rudram, hare krishna maha mant=
ra, chandipath, ganapati atharva seersham, mrityunjaya mantra=C2=A0etc) can=
 help one make progress if one develops the right attitude. Without the rig=

e -
=C2=A0
1.=C2=A0Statement 1: *fasting on any day or any tithi* is good s=

2.=C2=A0Statement 2: *reciti=
ng any prayer* will give the desired effects for any ailment we wish to rem=
edy
=C2=A0
Is this what you intended to say or did I get this wrong?
=C2=A0=

Statement 1 is an arrogance that the entire Jyotisha shastra is bogus and =
has no relevance as the remedial measures prescribed by Parasara and others=
 to be done on specific days are irrlevant and not of much consequence. Thi=
s sounds like another astrologer I had known some time back whose statement=
s like this coerced me to write Vedic Remedies in Astrology so that people =
are not misled but such pretexts to knowledge.
=C2=A0
Statement 2 is an arr=
ogance that the entire mantra shastra is useless and the Rishi=C3=A2=E2=82=

er all, Rudra rules over the element of fire and Gouri rules over the eleme=
nt of water and one worships Gouri at the time of marriage. Moreover, Venus=
 (water) is the karaka for marriage. So one could even say that UL/marriage=
 is represented by water element and fasting on UL lord's tithi brings the =
element of water (prosperity and well-being) to one's marriage (UL)? One co=
uld even say that fasting on the weekday of UL lord should be prohibited as=
 it brings the fire element represented by weekday to the water of UL and c=

 the Raashi Narasimha. It is the 12L which is the creator of the UL...just =
as the mother Gouri creates everything through the shakti of the graha, all=
 the arudha are created by her due to the lordships of the planets. So fast=
ing on the tithi lorded by the 12th lord will be a *more correct* answer.
>=
>>>>> End quote=C2=A0>>>>>>
=C2=A0
[Narasimha] We always say that houses (t=
ruth) are represented by Sun (aatman) and arudha padas (maya) by Moon (mind=
).
=C2=A0
Thus, 12th house is the actual creator and UL is the apparent cre=
ator in the field of maya. Houses (truth) should actually be associated wit=
h Sun (aatman) and Shiva (and not Gouri), while arudha padas (perception) s=
hould actually be associated with Moon (mind) and Gouri. After all, that is=
 what we do in the tripod method in dasa judgment.
=C2=A0
Thus, it is actua=
lly more logical to say that 12th house and 12th lord imbibe the agni tattv=
a of Sun and UL and UL lord imbibe the jala tattva of Moon.
=C2=A0
Is the a=
bove "*more correct* answer" based on your own thinking or is it from a cla=
ssic or from tradition?

=C2=A0
[Narasimha] Well, if one =
cannot fast, then one is destined to expend some energy on digestion after =
all and not focus all energy on the mantra. But the bottomline is that shas=
tras say that one should meditate either without or with very little food (=
niraahaaro mitaahaaro). In any case, I hope we agree that meditation sessio=

=C2=A0
[Narasimha] Putting a burning match in=
 a glass of water does=C2=A0indeed kill fire. But the question is of contac=
t. If I am thinking of fire in my mind while standing in water, it does not=
 kill the fire. There is no contact.
=C2=A0
My point is that the examples g=
iven have no real identifiable contact between water and fire.
=C2=A0
One c=

 that Moon and Venus are jala tattva and all rasis show agni tattva (then w=

. Then one can say fasting on the weekdays of the dispositors of Moon and V=
enus causes gandanta and serious danger.
=C2=A0
It is not enough to show so=

 Three years back you said you are leaving jyotish....then again you told m=

[Narasimha] Nothing is permanent. What is one's cannot be taken =

impassionately observe as things seem to come and go and do what they see a=

Just a factual correctio=
n though: I never said I was leaving Jyotish. For a few years after my spir=

 I continued to do other things) and my focus on spiritual sadhana intensif=
ied. So I said that my interest in Jyotish was very low. However, my guru g=

 a few lifetimes, the marriage will happen! I cannot say you are wrong, so =
I agree that what you say is right.

>>>>>> End quote=C2=A0>>>>>>
=C2=A0
[N=
arasimha] This is a gross exaggeration.
=C2=A0
Is all that is being taught =
and practiced now strictly from "Puranas and other teachings of the seers"?=

=C2=A0
I did not say all days and tithis are the same. Of course, there is=
 some difference. But, it is not as big as being made here.
=C2=A0
To make =
khoa, whether one uses cow milk or buffalo milk or milk of a brown cow or a=
 black cow or a Jersey cow or another cow does make some difference. But it=
 is secondary. To say that "danger" and "serious doshas" (see the quoted ma=
ils for such claims)=C2=A0can be caused by a wrong choice is wrong. To say =
that a wrong choice means khoa will take 100 years to make is also a gross=
=C2=A0exaggeration.
=C2=A0
The main thing is that you need milk and sugar. =
If one is confused by endless claims of khoa making consultants and ends up=
 not making khoa at all, that will be sad. In such a case, one can simply p=
ick some milk or the other, take sugar and start cooking khoa. It will take=
 an extra half hour, but the job will be done.
=C2=A0
I request Jyotishis t=
o behave responsibly and humbly and not engage in scare-mongering and say t=
hat a speicifc austerity (fasting on a specific weekday or=C2=A0tithi in a =
chart) can cause "danger" and "serious doshas". No wonder some spiritual te=
achers look down upon Jyotish and dismiss it. Such unbalanced attitude and =
self-importance from us does not help our cause!

Yes, Jyotish is hel=
pful, but let us not oversell it or overplay the importance.. .

[Narasimha] Of course, brahmacharya is much more, but a=
