Namaste,

As I said, faith cannot be debated. So I will not comment on your faith. 
But, I will justify one point I made which you questioned.

One can be seething with anger or sinking in shame internally and look 
totally composed externally. Body language after the debate does not mean 
much.

Let me tell you how I concluded that vaikhari "seemed to be" predominant in 
the debate.

Look at the reactions to the debate. After the debate, a lot of Hindus who 
watched it were very disappointed and disillusioned. Many average Hindus 
thought their religion was perhaps meaningless if somebody of the stature of 
Ravishankar was unable to explain inconsistencies even when given time and 
stage. Dr Naik was using Hindu scruptures to support his forceful and 
destructive points against Hinduism and Ravishankar was unable to counter 
him. You agreed earlier that several of even AOL members were disappointed 
and confused. As I said earlier, Dr Naik was rated as #3 spiritual teacher 
of India in a poll later.

Basically, reactions of people were entirely along the lines expected based 
on an intellectual analysis of the tangible words spoken. That suggests that 
the communication was mostly in vaikhari (tangible words). If the intangible 
force behind the words was strong, there would've been an impact on people 
that cannot be captured by an intellectual analysis of the tangible words 
spoken alone.

As an example, I mentioned Swami Vivekananda. When he finally mustered 
courage and spoke at the Chicago parliament of religions, thousands of 
people rose to their feet and cheered. Hundreds rushed towards the stage to 
have a closer look at him. One person who was present there described later 
that an indescribable excitement captured the hearts of many. If you 
intellectually analyze his spoken words, that reaction cannot be explained. 
People were reacting to something intangible in his speech! While tangible 
words are vaikhari, that intangible force behind the words is madhyama, 
pasyanti and para, in an increasing order of the power of impact.

One does encounter some works where there is an intangible force behind the 
written/spoken words.

While many may have a capability to touch *a few* people with an intangible 
force when they speak, based on the rinas, very very few masters have the 
ability to touch *many* people at the same time with an intangible force 
when they speak or write. I cannot comment on Sri Sri overall, but he seemed 
to lack such ability on that fateful day when he walked onto the stage as 
the representative of Hinduism.

Best regards,
Narasimha
