Namaste,

If one is doing a homam to ensure a specific material result (e.g. victory 
in a war, getting wealth, getting a child etc), there are many requirements. 
The first requirement is that a purified person with a good amount of shakti 
should do it. But that is not enough. In addition, there are many 
requirements on what to put in poornaahuti, what materials to offer, what 
materials to offer in bali, what muhurta to use etc. Material results 
require some material constraints.

It is my well-considered view that there aren't too many people who can 
ensure specific results by doing a homam. Moreover, the knowledge needed for 
those, of which what you mention below is only a small part, is lost. 
However, if some people are going to come in future who will demonstrate the 
power of homam even for material results of a big scale, all such knowledge 
will be revealed again, in time.

I only teach homam to those who want to purify their thinking and make 
spiritual progress. When homam is used for that purpose, all those rules are 
inapplicable. You can do any day and any time. However, for several homams, 
late night is inappropriate. Morning is the best, evening time (+/- 2 hours 
from sunset) is also very good and the rest of the day is ok.

Best regards,
Narasimha
