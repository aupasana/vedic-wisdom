Namaskaram Sri Narasimha Garu,
=A0
Thank you very much for the Manual.
=A0=

I had a question while going through the short procedure of the Homam. The=
 Sloka you have mentioned is Sri Rama Rama Rameti Rame....
=A0
>From one of =
your Astrology classes i remember you mentioning that if we say Sri Rama Ra=
ma Rama is enough instead of the entire slokam. I have been using that ever=
yday in my Homam.
=A0
But after looking at this manual i'm now confused if =
i have to use the full slokam or is it enough if i just read the above. Kin=
dly clarify.
=A0
Thanks
KK

Namaste,
=A0
Now a Vishnu sahasra n=
aama homam manual is available. It contains a very short procedure for Vish=
nu sahasra naama homam. It is very detailed and pretty much anybody=A0can f=
ollow it.
=A0
Those who regularly chant Vishnu sahasra naama stotram should=
 be able to perform a homam if they spend an extra 10 minutes, after a litt=
le practice. For those who are pressed for time and yet want to do a homam,=
 a super-short procedure involving one verse is also given.
=A0
The manual =
is available in English language, with mantras given in Sanskrit/Hindi, Eng=
lish, Telugu, Kannada or Malayalam scripts.
=A0
In addition to this manual,=
 manuals for Mahaganapathi homam, Chandi homam, Krishna homam, Shiva homam,=
 Mahalakshmi homam, Sani homam and Kuja homam are available. More will be c=
oming later.
=A0
Chanting Vishnu's 1000 names is very powerful in this age.=
 It is the best antidote for many problems, material and spiritual. Fire of=
 a reasonable size augments the effect. The philosophy of fire ritual is ex=
plained in the manual.
=A0
This is a part of the effort to enable a communi=
ty of sadhakas who worship various deities in fire, as per the command of t=
he divine Mother to my spiritual master at Kalikambal temple in Chennai in =
March 2006.
=A0
Please go to the homam website below to download the manual=
s. It is hoped that spiritual sadhakas interested in homam will benefit fro=
m this and also help in increasing collective dharma in this world with the=
ir contribution. Please feel free to spread this link among interested peop=
le.
=A0
Any philosophical or practical questions on homam or any spiritual =
sadhana can be discussed on the yahoogroup vedic-wisdom.
=A0
Best regards,
=
Narasimha
