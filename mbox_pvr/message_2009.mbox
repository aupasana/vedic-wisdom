Dear Narasimha,

Thank you for the nice words about Hanuman Chalisa.

For those who would like to listen to Hanuman Chalisa, here is a nice website

http://www.krishnadas.com/

Click on "Listen to KD" and you can listen to Hanuman Chalisa being sung in different "styles"...each one is equally beautiful...towards the end of the streaming webcast, you can also learn to sing/chant the Chalisa.

Chandraprakash

Namaste,

I am cc'ing to vedic-wisdom list while ensuring your anonymity.

Yes, you can adapt the Krishna homam manual. Replace "krishnam" with 
"hanumantam" , "kleem krishnaaya namah" with "ham hanumate namah", 
"krishnaaya" with "hanumate", "krishnasya" with "hanumatah", "krishnah" with 
"hanumaan", "krishna" with "hanumat" etc. Use haam, heem, hoom, haim, haum, 
hah for nyaasas. For beeja, shakti, keelaka, use haam, heem, haum. It is 
actually fine to read a verse of Hanuman and say "atra aagachchha, aavaahito 
bhava" etc.

For pradhaana homam, the BEST is Hanuman Chalisa. Even though it is not in 
Sanskrit, it is a very very powerful mantra as it was composed by a 
self-realized man. (What one writes or composes is infused with the gunas of 
one's mind at the time. For example, if a scholar writes something with an 
egoistic mind and with pride, the writing is infused with those gunas. 
Suppose someone writes a mail on this list when the mind is in a sublime 
state of god contemplation, the mail is infused with sattwa and can benefit 
people better. Similarly, the state of a mind that composed a prayer infuses 
the prayer with certain gunas. In my view, Tulsidas was a self-realized man 
by the time he composed Hanuman Chalisa and the purity of his mind, devotion 
and humility were infused into that composition. Similarly, most prayers 
written by Adi Shankara vibrate with the energy of a man full of god 
realization and also viveka - spiritual discrimination - of the highest 
kind.)

Another option is "Om Ham Hanumate Namah". Or you can pick ANY shloka of 
Hanuman and repeat it as many times as you can (e.g. atulita balaadhaamam. ., 
manojavam maarutatulyavegam. .., aanjaneyamatipaatal aananam.. , 
goshpadikritavaaraa sim..., buddhirbalam yashodhairyam. .. etc). Pick any ove 
verse you like and repeat it as many times as you can. You can also use the 
dwadasa naama stotra (hanumaan anjanaasoonuh vaayuputro mahaabalah.. .) or 
break it up into dwaadasa naamaavali (on hanumate namah, om anjanaasoonave 
namah, om vaayuputraaya namah etc). Bheemarupi Hanuman stotra is also 
powerful if you know it and like it.

Several options are there. But, if you know Hanuman Chalisa, it is THE best.

If you keep doing homam regularly for a few years, you will see a big 
difference in your personality and way of thinking. After all, the goal of 
sadhana is to change one from inside. Attitudes built over many lives cannot 
be destroyed in a day, but they can be slowly undone over a few years of 
intense sadhana. Homam is undoubtedly a very effective form of sadhana. I am 
glad you are finding some difference. Keep doing it. Good luck with Hanuman 
Homam.

Best regards,
Narasimha
