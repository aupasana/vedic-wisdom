I want to expand on this point and go into a different topic. In the last few years, we've had many cases of anti-depression medicines causing suicides and being recalled after a few years of field use.
 
In ayurveda, there are three predominant types of people - kapha, pitta and vaata. Various health problems manifest differently in these three types and are treated differently. For example, take depression. A depressed kapha person (predominant elements - earth and water) has dullness and lethargy lurking under the depression. A depressed pitta person (predominant elements - fire and water) has anger and frustration lurking under the depression. A depressed vaata person (predominant elements - air and ether) has anxiety and nervousness lurking under the depression. They are not the same!
 
If a clinical study is conducted with mostly vaata people or kapha people, an anti-depressant that aggravates pitta may seem to work. But, when it is used later by pitta people who already have accumulated anger and frustration under the depression, it may aggravate pitta, increase the aggressive streak and make them suicidal. Sadly, modern medicine does not recognize ayurvedic types and does not take them into account when performing controlled experiments, drawing conclusions or dispensing medicines in the field.
 
Science defines narrow (and solvable!) problems and solves them. Once a solvable problem is set narrowly, science shows a perfect path from the problem to the solution. However, the issue is that real life problems are not like that. So those who apply science have to approximate the problems using a lot of unspoken assumptions, in order to make them solvable and narrow. In the end, the solution may or may not be correct.
 
It is my firm conviction that teachings of rishis and Indian yogis (e.g. ayurveda) are far more holistic than the piecemeal offerings of modern science, in the areas of physical, mental and spiritual wellness.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

As a result, what happens is that scientists honestly and accurately state their narrow conclusions and those who apply that knowledge end up extrapolating a bit. That is why one scientific research may conclude that so and so medicine helps depression and another research may later conclude that the same medicine may make depressed people commit suicide and the medicine may be recalled!

Absorption of various nutrients, their interplay, their distribution in the system, their impact on metabolism, anabolism and catabolism etc, are not fully understood by modern science. Modern science could only capture a data point here and a data point there, but not the full holistic picture.

Agni (fire) is transformative energy and so many transformations of matter are occurring everywhere in the body. For example, production of various enzymes and hormones in the body involves different kinds of agni. Ayurveda enumerates tens of different kinds of agni at the physical level alone. There are all kinds of connections between these agnis and the food we eat.

As I said, modern science captures a data point here and a data point there and not a holistic picture. Of course, people like you may want to study modern science critically in order to prepare themselves for possible debates of future. But it is not a good idea to let it control your thinking. Modern science is not worthy enough.

The research took gorillas (or perhaps chimpanzees) that were comparable in various ways and did a controlled experiment over a period of time. The explanation in terms of brain development was only a speculation. The only real scientific conclusion of theirs was that eating vegetarian diet over a period of time made them smarter.

> Natural forces facilitate both suric and asuric (divine and demonic) forces that are constantly pulling the universe in different directions. Nature favors demonic forces at times and divine forces at times, but divine forces in the long run. Great demons ruled earth for thousands of years in the past. When demonic thoughts were prevalent, no rishi or god who came to earth said, "this is the work of natural forces and so it must be good". Instead, they fought it and changed things. The predominant thinking of this age that vegetarianism is "unnatural" and inefficient, to me, indicates a temporary domination of asuric thought. It needs to be defeated by hook or crook.
