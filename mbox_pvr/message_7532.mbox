Namaste friends,

I have been meaning to write these words on the future of homam movement 
for many months now, but it never happened until now.

*        *        *

Homam movement is slowly gathering steam. There seem to be many 
thousands of people doing homam by themselves now (though not all of 
them are members of this vedic-wisdom yahoogroup). Some of them are 
making good spiritual progress and undergoing transformation. Many of 
them are enjoying the experience and feeling some peace and happiness. 
Several of them are also enjoying some material benefits.

This movement may catch on even more with time and play an important 
role in the establishment of Sanatana dharma on earth over the next 
several decades.

*        *        *

I encourage everyone interested in doing homam to try it and continue if 
they like it. I also encourage everyone interested in spreading homam to 
tell others about it and show the the free manuals, audio and video. 
There will be more free resources in future and these will be organized 
better.

But please never make this commercial or forceful. Never charge money 
for teaching homam, as that would be a very bad idea. Also, never try to 
sell it hard or put pressure. Tell people about it and let them do it 
when (and if!) they are ready. Tell people about it passionately, but 
don't expect anything. Most importantly, don't be disappointed or 
disheartened if some people told by you do not start homam.

Action is a *sacred* duty and do not shy away from right and dharmik 
action (as judged by your conscience). But results are not in your hands 
and hence do not be disappointed if a seemingly perfect action did not 
give the intended result.

*        *        *

Lastly, some people have developed a special attachment, love, respect 
and even fascination for Manish and me. I strongly recommend not doing 
that.

This movement will last a long time, but we'll be gone sooner or later. 
Moreover, we may or may not be what you imagine us to be. We may be 
normal people with weaknesses and troubled by shadripus. In any case, it 
is irrelevant really. It is not about us, but about Fire!

If someone sees me as a guru, I cannot stop that. But let me make it 
very clear that I am not some powerful guru. I am a normal person who 
happens to be introducing a powerful guru (Fire!) that everybody can 
approach and benefit from!

My message is not that Manish or I are special, can confer blessings on 
you and solve your problems. My message is that I can show you a way in 
which you yourself can solve your problems IF you are ready to put in 
some effort. Let us recede into background and let your attention, love, 
respect, devotion and fascination be directed towards Fire instead of 
us.

Fire is the original guru and original priest. He can guide you, remove 
your weaknesses over time and take you to god. If there are mistakes in 
your method, he can also help in getting them rectified in time. 
Surrender to Fire and request him to guide you and take you to god. He 
will not disappoint you.

Best regards,
Narasimha
