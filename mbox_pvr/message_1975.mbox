Namaste Ram ji,
 
Shraaddham is an offering of balls of solid food for dece=
ased ancestors on special occasions.
 
Pitri tarpana is an offering of wate=
r for pitris (deceased ancestors who are stuck with some desires) to satisf=
y them. Not so long ago, every Braahmana used to perform a brief pitri tarp=
ana everyday, as a part of daily rituals. This is not without reason.
 
*  =
      *        *
 
The thoughts of the minds around us do have a subtle imp=
act on our mind. When too many depressed, sad or frustrated people are arou=
nd you, it will have a negative effect on you. Similarly, when some peacefu=
l and blissful people or elevated souls are around you, it will have a posi=
tive effect on you. Thus, thoughts in the minds around you does have an imp=
act on you.
 
This is particularly true with respect to the minds of people=
 who have genetic/kaarmik links/debts with you. When minds of such people a=
re in great distress or great excitement, it has an impact on your mind.
 
=
If a deceased ancestor to whom you have a kaarmik debt has some strong desi=
res and unable to progress to a higher loka or be reborn, his thoughts and =
desires will have an impact on your mind.
 
Thus, we invest our mental ener=
gy praying for their relief. While offering balls of solid food (shraaddha)=
 on special occasions, pray that the ancestor may get an appropriate body a=
gain to fulfil remaining desires. While leaving water in pitri tarpana, pra=
y that the ancestor's desires may be satisfied and the ancestor may be over=
come the weaknesses. By praying for helping an ancestor, you are indirectly=
 helping yourself, by removing a powerful negative influence on your mind a=
nd getting rid of some weaknesses.
 
Unfortunately, the extremely simple ri=
tual of pitri tarpana is out of fashion today. However, so many people will=
 benefit tremendously if they do it atleast once every month if not daily. =
Vimalananda says that he will pick pitri tarpana if there is only one ritua=
l he can perform.
 
*        *        *
 
Not long ago, every orthodox Braa=
hmana used to perform a fire ritual and a water ritual (tarpana) everyday. =
Rituals use external symbols to induce internal changes. These two rituals =
are really important and useful rituals.
 
A small comparison of homam and =
tarpana is reproduced from vedic-wisdom yahoogroup archives:
 
------------=
--------------
One word on Homam vs Tarpana. In homam, you are calling deva=
tas and the medium is fire. In tarpana, you are calling pitris and the medi=
um is water. Both sadhanas are applicable to all people irrespective of whe=
ther watery signs/planets are strong or fiery signs/planets in their horosc=
ope.
 
In homam, devatas come in fire and burn your blocking karmas to puri=
fy you. In tarpana, pitris come in water and free you from vasanas (conditi=
oning of the mind) that were karmically inherited from them. If you have ge=
nes from (and rina with) an ancestor who was lustful or angry or jealous an=
d the consciousness of the deceased ancestor is still having those thoughts=
, you will also suffer from such thoughts due to the connection and may eve=
n commit some bad karmas because of the weaknesses. You can free yourself f=
rom the rina by working on giving a rebirth to that ancestor. If the ancest=
or's consciousness is attached to a new body, the thoughts and cravings of =
that consciousness will not affect your consciousness in the same way. Thus=
, tarpana aims to cut off a strong source of bad karmas, while homam burns =
off previously committed bad karmas. Both are very important sadhanas for s=
piritual progress.
 
Devatas are very subtle forms of consciousness. Their =
self-identification is to what is known as soul and represented by Sun. The=
y work on your individual soul and free it from the karmas it carries. Pitr=
is are grosser forms of consciousness with strong attachments and desires. =
Their self-identification is with what is known as mind and represented by =
Moon. You may note that Sun and Moon are associated with Devas and Pitris i=
n the hora chart of astrology. Fire and water are the natural media for the=
m respectively.
 
Devas and pitris have different ways of working and influ=
encing us and helping our spiritual progress. But both are relevant to all =
of us and have a role to play in our spiritual evolution. Worshipping devas=
 in fire and satisfying pitris in water are very important.
