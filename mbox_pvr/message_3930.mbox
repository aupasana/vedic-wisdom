Namaste,

I am forwarding Manish's co=
mments on Vijay's mail.

In addition, I want to respond to Vijay's points 3=
 and 4.

* * *

3. The word energy or shakti may sound heavy and may have a=
ll kinds of connotations in the minds of people. Shakti is simply a force t=
hat can be used to change or move something karmically.

Suppose you see so=
mething or someone beautiful and the enemy of "desire" (one of shadripus - =
six internal enemies) tries to attack your mind. Or suppose someone abuses =
you and the enemy of "anger" tries to attack your mind. How does your mind =
fight back?

Just as you need energy to fight external enemies, your mind n=
eeds energy to fight internal enemies. If your mind has no shakti, the enem=
ies take over and take mind in a direction. If you mind has and exerts shak=
ti, the enemies are stopped (fully or partially) and the their push on the =
mind is negated.

When you eat, you get physical energy. When you exercise,=
 that physical energy is stored in the right places of the body. Similarly,=
 when your mind spends time in a state of focused calmness, it eats from th=
e universal source of shakti and gets nourished. When it spends time in pat=
terns of regulated exercises (e.g. homam, japam, bhajan, satsang etc), it s=
tores that shakti in the right places in the mind.

Just as physical energy=
 helps you fight external enemies who attack you, this spiritual energy hel=
ps you fight internal enemies who attack you.

If your surrender is perfect=
 and you are going through the good and bad fruits of your karmas without c=
ommitting new karmas, your point is right. You are like a weightless leaf a=
nd you need no energy - you go with the flow. But, if you still have a cond=
itioned mind that is vulnerable to attacks from shadripus and vulnerable to=
 committing NEW karmas, don't you think some energy is needed?

Don't look =
at spiritual shakti as something that enables you to do great deeds in the =
world. Though that too is possible, that is a ego-promiting attitude and in=
appropriate for most sadhakas. Looks at spiritual shakti as something that =
enables you to fight back your own internal enemies and overcome your own w=
eaknesses.

* * *

4. If you are living every second without any goals/agen=
das/ wishes/anticipat ions at all, then you are all already liberated and t=
hen your point is meaningful.

But, if you do have some some goals, some wi=
shes, some anticipations, some agendas etc, then you should realize that th=
ose wishes and anticipations have a kinetic energy of their own (kaarmicall=
y) and they bind you further. You need the spiritual energy (shakti) accumu=
lated through exertion of self-control to negate that kinetic energy and st=
op you from getting bound further.

Some people make the mistake of thinkin=
g that desire of moksha is also a desire and can stop you from moksha. That=
 is true. However, it is better than many other desires and definitely wort=
h having. It can be jettisoned when the time comes.

Suppose you have a tra=
sh can in which you collect trash. Just throw away the collected trash and =
hang on to the trash can. If you throw away the can too, then new trash tha=
t comes in will be all over the floor. So keep the can so that you keep col=
lecting trash and throwing it away. You can throw away the trash can also, =
when you are absolutely sure that no trash is being generated.

Best regard=
s,
Narasimha
