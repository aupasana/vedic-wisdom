Namaste,
 
Thinking of the stories of the Mother and contemplating on them =
can help one. However, there are a few other factors to consider:
 
(1) Man=
tras in Sanskrit have been meditated upon by many saints and yogis in the p=
ast and their effect on the mind is well-understood. A sequence of sounds, =
when repeated with full mental focus, creates a certain energy. Just thinki=
ng of the meaning may not create the same energy. For example, sounds witho=
ut any meaning also produce specific energies in the mind when we focus on =
those sounds single-mindedly.
 
(2) The sadhana of so many saints and yogis=
 who used the mantras before adds to the power of those Sanskrit mantras.
 =

This is my opinion: Reading meanings of Chandipath is also good and create=
s positive thoughts. But repeating the Sanskrit mantras (even without under=
standing the meaning) is superior to that! It creates well-understood energ=
y in the consciousness.
 
If one carrying a seed does not understand what i=
t is for and makes a replica in gold, which in his opinion is better, one i=
s losing the basic functionality of the seed. The golden seed may appeal to=
 one as it does not get spoiled and looks better to one's senses, but it ca=
n never give rise to a plant. The original seed, on the other hand, can giv=
e rise to a plant when one figures out how to germinate it.
 
*        *   =
     *
 
One or two years back, I wanted to translate Chandipath into Hindi=
 or Telugu (my mother tongue) in poetic form or even prose form so that peo=
ple speaking those languages can read it instead of Sanskrit verses and und=
erstand better what they are reading. But my guru (Manish) discouraged me. =
He said something written by a person like me with a dense ego would not ha=
ve the same power as a Puranic verse. The Sanskrit verses of Chandipath wer=
e composed by someone with a highly effaced ego and in communion with divin=
ity. The same could be said about several sacred writings in many religions=
 in many languages. There is something special about words composed by sain=
ts, yogis and messiahs who were in a very elevated state of being, where th=
e individual ego is effaced largely and the mind is filled with some divine=
 energy (which is not possible when individual ego occupies the space of mi=
nd).
 
So Manish told me to wait till I was ready (if ever) for such a proj=
ect. I realized the wisdom in his advice and removed the thought of this pr=
oject from my mind.
 
When Jnaneshwar Maharaj composed Jnaneshwari (Marathi=
 translation of Bhagavad Gita in poetic form), he was in a very purified st=
ate of consciousness. Hence there is divine power in his Marathi words and =
many saints experienced divinity by chanting his Marathi verses. Same with =
Ram Charit Manas by Sant Tulasidas. Those are inspired translations.
 
If o=
ne has access only to words spoken by a normal person in a language that on=
e can understand, it is better to repeat words spoken by an elevated being =
instead, even if one does not understand the meaning.
 
Best regards,
Naras=
imha

  Dear Sir Narsimhaji,
  There are two thinking =
for Chandipath chanting.

  1. Every verse in Chandipath is a mantra and re=
ading of Chandipath in Sanskrit is more meaningful to please Goddess and to=
 get desired results. It is created in Sanskrit and whether we may follow t=
he meaning of the verses or not, we should read in Sanskrit only if we can =
read Sanskrit fluently because every Verse has its vibrations with full of =
energy.

  2. If we read in Sanskrit, we never involve ourselves in the 'Li=
la' of Durga nor we enjoy the story of Janma(Birth) of different Shakties n=
arrated in Chandipath  (This is only possible for those who are scholars in=
 Sanskrit and can translate each and every verse immediately while reading.=
 For others it is simply reading with faith and devotion.)- Better way is, =
it should be read in regional language with full involvement in the 'Lila'.=
 Here we can enjoy the different roles of Shaktis, fully understand the dif=
fernet Births etc. This type of reading makes Chandipath more meaningful. 
=

  Dear Sir, I request your advice as what is the real way of chanting Sri =
Chandipath from these two?

  Dr. Ashwin Rawal
