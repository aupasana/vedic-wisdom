Namaste friends,
 
I am forwarding a mail from Vinay ji that was cc'ed to vedic-wisdom but not delivered due to non-membership.
 
Namaste Vinay ji,
 
> In your message above, I read "I am the body". This feeling
> is what I endeavoured to overcome through Tapa for years.
 
As you correctly judged, I do identify with this body most of the time, except at the time of experiences like the one described below. All we can do is to endeavour to overcome it..
 
> This is the real Siddhi we should all strive for : Seal-realization.
 
When this discussion on siddhis and shakti started a while back, that is essentially what I said. I am in full agreement with you.
 
Of course, knowing intellectually is one thing, tasting it now and then is another and being it always is yet another! As you said, this requires Tapas. Having wrong goals like obtaining this siddhi or that siddhi or physical immortality does not help one in that.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
