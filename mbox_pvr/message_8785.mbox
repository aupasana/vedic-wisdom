Namaste friends,
=A0
First a word on "Prasna". There are just 9 planets and=
 12 houses representing millions of things. For example, Ketu shows mistake=
s and the same Ketu shows spiritual progress and even moksha. The 12th hous=
e shows losses and the same 12th house shows moksha. When an astrologer loo=
ks at omens or planets influencing various houses, he/she obviously uses hi=
s/her judgment and intuition to connect the dots. His/her subjective opinio=
ns will of course come into play.
=A0
Even if a really good astrologer come=
s to know of the general area, he/she need not be correct on all specifics.=
 Please realize that he/she does not have a TV in which everything is "show=
n". Excellent astrologers and even excellent priests are not beyond biases =
and their own conditioning.
=A0
If I get a sense that you are making some m=
istake, I may talk about some technicalities like counts, materials etc if =
that is what I am conditioned to focus on. I may talk about pronunciation i=
f that is what I am conditioned to focus on. I may talk about devotion if t=
hat is what I am conditioned to focus on.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
The tussle between the "letter" & "spirit" of scri=
ptures will go on perennially. Those who stick to the "letter" may find irr=
econcilable contradictions between different religions, traditions and scri=
ptures and may end up accepting one thing vs the other. Those who understan=
d the "spirit" can often reconcile everything.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Mixing a bit of ghee with every offering (and n=
ot just sesame seeds) is auspicious. But, if it is cumbersome, there is not=
hing wrong in offering materials individually, as long as SOME ghee is ALSO=
 offered in the homam separately. Of course, shastras actually talk about d=
oing a homam in complete absence of ghee also.
=A0
Shastras are very flexib=
le. Shastras say ghee made of cow's milk is the best. Otherwise, ghee made =
of buffalo's milk is preferred. If not, ghee made of goat's milk is preferr=
ed. If not, sesame oil is preferred. A long list is given. In the worst cas=
e, even mustard oil (which is not a saattwik substance) is mentioned!
=A0
T=
he bottomline is that making even inferior offerings is better than making =
no offerings.
=A0
As for sesame seeds, they are not "dry" like some other m=
aterials (wood, grains etc) and they contain plenty of sesame oil within th=
em. Many scriptures actually praise sesame seeds.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
In any case, my friends, the physical mate=
rials you offer are *external symbols* or proxies and the real offering is =
made through mind.
=A0
Suppose you give an exquisite gift to a friend, but =
with disinterest and wrong attitude. Your friend may not like it. Suppose y=
ou give a humble gift, but with a lot of love and caring. Your friend may a=
ppreciate it. Gods will appreciate your love, devotion, sincerity and surre=
nder more than tons of ghee, sesame seeds etc.
=A0
As that surrender is wea=
k within us, we are taking help from external fire and making use of it to =
resonate with inner fire and develop inner surrender. So we need to make re=
asonable external offerings to the external fire to keep it going and keep =
it *saattwik*. So I will not say that you can throw anything. But, as long =
as you offer basically saattwik materials and keep the fire going, you are =
all set. Instead of getting too carried away with rules and technicalities,=
 focus on your mental condition and feeling.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Once I attended a homam conducted by a gentlema=
n who is now the head of a nice temple-cum-ashram. He announced before poor=
nahuti "this poornahuti contains 64 auspicious and rare materials specially=
 procured from India. You are so lucky to witness this poornahuti. You may =
not get such an opportunity again". THIS attitude of pride or feeling speci=
al is a "dosha" if you ask me. Poornahuti is supposed to be "complete surre=
nder" to deity and not an occasion to feel proud of what materials you are =
offering. If someone else offers just one copra or even a raisin (kismis or=
 dried grape) and really feels the sense of surrender to the deity and medi=
tates with focus, it may be a *far superior* poornaahuti.
=A0
External also=
 matters when our minds are so deeply tied to it. But don't get overly caug=
ht in the external. Make the right tradeoffs - do just enough at the extern=
al level and focus most energy on the internal side. That is MY humble advi=
ce.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
The 10-to-1 rat=
io rule is not universally followed by all.
=A0
If one has enough time to m=
editate with a mantra for 10 hours for every 1 hour of homam with it, fine,=
 go ahead and do it.
=A0
In the old days, people spent hours on spiritual s=
adhana everyday and were quite pure. Times have changed. If one has only 30=
-60 minutes everyday for spiritual sadhana, spending that time in front of =
fire is the optimum way to use it.
=A0
If one wants to paint a perfect pict=
ure on a special canvas to submit for an important event, one may want to f=
irst practice on normal paper and paint it on the special canvas after beco=
ming proficient. If one does not have that much time, it may be better to j=
ust draw an imperfect picture on the special canvas and submit it. Similarl=
y, getting some practice with a mantra before offering it in the all-powerf=
ul Fire is a good idea. But, if one has limited time, one has to make wise =
tradeoffs.
=A0
One factor is that Fire amplifies results. If someone who is=
 basically quite pure makes offerings in Fire with a mantra that he used in=
 past lives, progress may come too quickly and it may be unnerving. With ja=
pam, things may happen slower.
=A0
But that is unlikely to happen to most p=
eople today anyway. Even if it does, it is debatable whether it is bad or g=
ood. My guess is that the 0.0001% to whom such a thing happens will figure =
out how to deal with it.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 =
*
=A0
As I always say, I am not a missionary. How many people do homam and =
what rules they follow, do not concern me. I am just an enabler. I merely m=
ake some resources available. People are free to take it or leave it. Also,=
 people are free to follow any rules set by their gurus or elders or just t=
heir inner voice. They need not pay heed to my 2 cents.
=A0
In the end, eve=
ry soul has its path to traverse.
=A0
Happy Vijaya Dasami friends!

Best=
 regards,
Narasimha
