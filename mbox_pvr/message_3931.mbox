I tend to agree with the poin=

and from the Vimalandas words our life is a result of the accumulated Bless=
ings and Curses..
=C2=A0
We inhale and exhale continuously and in the proce=

e any process that helps us in getting over such karma? 
=C2=A0
Also, when =
we fall sick we would tend to take antibiotics etc that in turn would kill =

=
=C2=A0
Also, we may be soing such acts very unknowingly. .does the acts tha=

=C2=A0
also just wondering here about doing the karmas in a deta=

=C2=A0 

Namaste,

I am forwarding Manish's =
comments on Vijay's mail.

In addition, I want to respond to Vijay's points=
 3 and 4.

* * *

3. The word energy or shakti may sound heavy and may have=
 all kinds of connotations in the minds of people. Shakti is simply a force=
 that can be used to change or move something karmically.

Suppose you see =
something or someone beautiful and the enemy of "desire" (one of shadripus =
- six internal enemies) tries to attack your mind. Or suppose someone abuse=
s you and the enemy of "anger" tries to attack your mind. How does your min=
d fight back?

Just as you need energy to fight external enemies, your mind=
 needs energy to fight internal enemies. If your mind has no shakti, the en=
emies take over and take mind in a direction. If you mind has and exerts sh=
akti, the enemies are stopped (fully or partially) and the their push on th=
e mind is negated.

When you eat, you get physical energy.
 When you exerci=
se, that physical energy is stored in the right places of the body. Similar=
ly, when your mind spends time in a state of focused calmness, it eats from=
 the universal source of shakti and gets nourished. When it spends time in =
patterns of regulated exercises (e.g. homam, japam, bhajan, satsang etc), i=
t stores that shakti in the right places in the mind.

Just as physical ene=
rgy helps you fight external enemies who attack you, this spiritual energy =
helps you fight internal enemies who attack you.

If your surrender is perf=
ect and you are going through the good and bad fruits of your karmas withou=
t committing new karmas, your point is right. You are like a weightless lea=
f and you need no energy - you go with the flow. But, if you still have a c=
onditioned mind that is vulnerable to attacks from shadripus and vulnerable=
 to committing NEW karmas, don't you think some energy is needed?

Don't lo=
ok at spiritual shakti as
 something that enables you to do great deeds in =
the world. Though that too is possible, that is a ego-promiting attitude an=
d inappropriate for most sadhakas. Looks at spiritual shakti as something t=
hat enables you to fight back your own internal enemies and overcome your o=
wn weaknesses.

* * *

4. If you are living every second without any goals/=
agendas/ wishes/anticipat ions at all, then you are all already liberated a=
nd then your point is meaningful.

But, if you do have some some goals, som=
e wishes, some anticipations, some agendas etc, then you should realize tha=
t those wishes and anticipations have a kinetic energy of their own (kaarmi=
cally) and they bind you further. You need the spiritual energy (shakti) ac=
cumulated through exertion of self-control to negate that kinetic energy an=
d stop you from getting bound further.

Some people make the mistake of thi=
nking that desire of moksha is also a desire and can stop you from
 moksha.=
 That is true. However, it is better than many other desires and definitely=
 worth having. It can be jettisoned when the time comes.

Suppose you have =
a trash can in which you collect trash. Just throw away the collected trash=
 and hang on to the trash can. If you throw away the can too, then new tras=
h that comes in will be all over the floor. So keep the can so that you kee=
p collecting trash and throwing it away. You can throw away the trash can a=
lso, when you are absolutely sure that no trash is being generated.

Best r=
egards,
Narasimha

arya and
 virya:<BR>> <BR>> In a ml of semen, there are millions of s=
perm, most living beings with<BR>> potential to form a jiva.<BR>> Loo=
k at them under a microscope in a hospital if you get a chance some day.<BR=
>> They swim really energetically, exactly like tadpoles. You would try =
not to<BR>> kill tadpoles normally would'nt you? or maybe, it would be o=
k to take God's<BR>> name and kill them?<BR>> <BR>> The point is t=
hat those poor beings are destined for short life and death<BR>> normall=
y.<BR>> If you realised this and stopped yourself by Brahmacharya, still=
 you would<BR>> have nightly emissions. Partly, rich food, partly lots o=
f Kama related<BR>> thoughts are responsible.<BR>> Whenever you think=
 of a woman/man in that way, just stop your thought by<BR>> conscious ef=
fort and look at the thought, you will clearly see the<BR>> copulation h=
appening in your thought in the head.<BR>> That is problematic, but
 ess=
entially it means that sex starts in the mind<BR>> only. Control the min=
d and things are generally fine.<BR>> <BR>> The other thing is the pr=
ostatic fluid itself, if you get a slight erection<BR>> say after 20-30 =
days of strict Brahmacharya, you will notice that although<BR>> there is=
 no emission of sperm, some prostatic fluid comes out (this is a<BR>> fo=
rm of Shukra-Acharya. ... prostatic fluid nourishes sperm and ....<BR>> =
"teaches" it) This also represents a loss of shakti.<BR>> <BR>> Right=
, so, how to stop it??<BR>> <BR>> Even if you are a good sadhaka and =
keep Bramhacharya for a few days,<BR>> someday you may be destined for a=
 fall from Brahmacharya, for example, if<BR>> some great looking heroine=
 comes to you and drops her clothes without asking,<BR>> how many of you=
 will be able to resist, keeping in mind that sexual imagery<BR>> from f=
ilms may have already spoiled the mind. Most difficult...
 .<BR>> There =
are only two ways, total control, which very few can do or total<BR>> gr=
atification followed by terrific sadhana.<BR>> Here is where Tantra is s=
uperb, none of these so called gurus can match a<BR>> true sadhaka of ta=
ntra. Unfortunately, tantra has got a bad name just as<BR>> sitting in a=
 smashan and doing sadhana. In the former people are afraid of<BR>> Her =
in the form of Maya, in the other the pasha of fear which binds normal<BR>&=
gt; humans.<BR>> Most normal people mix up ordinary sex with a sadhana o=
f a sexual nature.<BR>> These are two separate things. Sadhana of this s=
ort tricks the mind in many<BR>> ways already discussed before.<BR>> =
I would suggest that Shiva lata Mudra is superb in bringing about the kind<=
BR>> of control which most people cannot imagine.<BR>> First, you wil=
l stick to one partner for the sadhana, that is a kind of<BR>> Brahmacha=
rya in itself.<BR>> Two, the sadhana when it
 matures, will be so good t=
hat ordinary sex will be<BR>> thrown out of the window.<BR>> Three, a=
 naked woman or man can no longer arouse you in the way it did when<BR>>=
 you first started.<BR>> Four, the play of the deity within your respect=
ive bodies will give you<BR>> knowledge which normal people do not have.=
<BR>> Five, even if you are born again, your partner in this sadhana and=
 the<BR>> deities will both come to you unasked, where can they escape? =
The Law of<BR>> karma applies to everybody.<BR>> Six, The bliss of no=
t having to think of sex will occur for many months on<BR>> end.<BR>>=
 The aashirvaad given by the sperm for not being killed (millions of such<B=
R>> beings), is so tremendous that the Ojas of such a sadhaka amplifies<=
BR>> tremendously. Notice that i still say sadhaka, not "Great exhalted =
Guru" or<BR>> "Bhagawan" or all that rubbish.<BR>> As far as I am con=
cerned, very few people are qualified
 enough to be a Guru(<BR>> I do no=
t think that I am, but I guide those who come to me as my children).<BR>>=
; True Gurus of the sort mentioned in the AGHORA books are almost impossibl=
e<BR>> to find, and even if you do find such a Guru, will you do everyth=
ing such a<BR>> being says? How good a disciple can most of us be?<BR>&g=
t; And the punishment for Guru Droha to such a being..... don't even ask.<B=
R>> Unfortunately, sometimes for some people, even when a real sadhaka/<=
BR>> Guru comes to their door, they foolishly direct that person elsewhe=
re, such<BR>> is the force of maya.<BR>> <BR>> Love<BR>> Manish=
