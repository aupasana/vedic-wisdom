Namaste,
 
Saptashati printed by Gita press has various options for samputi=
karana. Instead of using a beejakshara for samputikarana, one can use vario=
us verses. Some of them are well-known for specific results. Gita press ver=
sion mentions them.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

  Dear All

  Can anyone suggest =
a good Sanskrit edition of the Devi Mahatmyam?

  The current book that I h=
ave is by Swami Jagishwarananda (Ram Krishna Math) and it does not have any=
 of the samputikarana procedure as mentioned by Narasimha.

  Any suggestio=
n for good translations of the Chandi Paath in English would also be apprec=
iated.

  Thank you for your help.

  Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Samputikaran=
a with beejas (Re: a question on Chandi Paath..)


  Dear Utpal and friends=
,

  Yes, this is samputikarana (enclosure). The entire prathama charitra i=
s 
  enclosed with Mahakali's beeja "aim". The entire madhyama charitra is =

  enclosed with Mahalakshmi' s beeja "hreem". The entire uttara charitra i=
s 
  enclosed with Mahasaraswati' s beeja "kleem".

  If you want to enclos=
e any mantra with a beeja, the best way is to say "om 
  beeja" at the begi=
nning and "beeja om" at the end. For example, you can read 
  Vishnu sahasr=
a naama stotram or Lakshmi ashtottara sata naama stotram with 
  "om shriim=
" at the start of "shriim om" at the end of each verse, for 
  prosperity. =
You can read Narasimha's mantra with "om kshroum" at the 
  beginning and "=
kshroum om" at the end for removal of poisons (material and 
  subtle). You=
 can add "om kliim" and "kliim om" (at start/end) to several 
  mantras, in=
cluding Gayatri mantra, to overcome desires.

  You can note that each chap=
ter in Chandipath is also enclosed with plain Om. 
  You get "om RShiruvaac=
a" at the beginning and there is an "om" at the end of 
  the chapter. Plac=
ing plain Om at the beginning and end of a mantra is the 
  simplest samput=
ikarana. It is used for all the 13 chapters.

  * * *

  When you do Chandi=
path, it is actually fine to use the 3 beejas (aim, hreem, 
  kleem) to do =
samputikarana of *each verse* in the respective chapters. For 
  example, f=
irst chapter will go as

  "om aim RShiruvaaca aim om
  om aim saavaarNiH s=
uurya tanayo yo manuH kathyate.aShTamaH
  nishaamaya tadutpattim vistaraat =
gadato mam aim om
  om aim mahaa maayaanubhaavena yathaa manvantaraadhipaH
=
  sa babhuuva mahaabhaagaH saavarNistanayo raveH aim om..."

  Like this, a=
dd "om aim" at the beginning and "aim om" at the end of each 
  verse in fi=
rst chapter. For each verse in chapters 2, 3 and 4, add "om 
  hriim" and "=
hriim om". For each verse in other 9 chapters, add "om kliim" 
  and "kliim=
 om".

  * * *

  The beeja aim is known as sristhi beeja or creative seed.=
 It puts life in 
  material and subtle things. Note that Brahma is the ris=
hi for the first part 
  (pratha charitra).

  The beeja hriim is known as =
maayaa beeja or delusion seed. It gives mastery 
  over the delusion of thi=
s universe and helps one come out of maya. Note that 
  Vishnu is the rishi=
 for the middle part (madhyama charitra).

  The beeja kliim is known as ka=
ama beeja or desire seed. It helps overcome 
  desires and cleanse one. Not=
e that Rudra is the rishi for the final part 
  (uttara charitra).

  Best =

  Narasimha
