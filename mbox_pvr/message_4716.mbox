I am afraid our understanding o=
f the word "paramahamsa" is not the same..
 
Swan is supposed to able to re=
move water from milk. Similarly, a paramahamsa (absolute swan) is one who c=
an extract out the bad in a person and leave him with the good that is alre=
ady in him. In other words, a paramahamsa is one who can interact with ANYO=
NE (with any degrees of good and bad) and transform one into an ideal perso=
n. For example, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa associated with drunkards and woman=
izers like Girish and Kalipad and transformed them.
 
If one thinks the wor=
ld does not deserve one's services and lives in a cave, one may be great an=
d realized, but not a paramahamsa.
 
*        *        *
 
In fact, look at=
 Parasara's directives on finding a paramahamsa. He said Mercury in 5th fro=
m karakamsa makes one a paramahamsa. Why Mercury and why not Jupiter?
 
Jup=
iter is wise, but Mercury is flexible and adaptive. Mercury can identify wi=
th anyone. Mercury is compassionate and can place himself in the shoes of a=
nyone and think/feel like that person. That is also why Mercury is the kara=
ka for good communication skills. A good communicator can visualize from th=
e angle of his audience.
 
Ramakrishna once identified with grass so strong=
ly that when a crow walked on the grass, there were bloody scratches on his=
 body. Such ability to identify with someone else is needed for transformin=
g someone else. That is why Parasara mentioned Mercury for Paramahamsa.

I agree with Rajarshi on this. If a Chanakya is on eart=
h and ready to guide Chandragupta, a Chandragupta would automatically come.=
 If a Samartha Ramadas is on earth and ready too guide Shivaji, a Shivaji w=
ould automatically come.
 
In fact, Swami Vivekananda once humbly said that=
 Ramakrishna could have created one thousand Vivekanandas from sand!

I suspected that=
 we did not have a real disagreement. But I was presenting a different pers=
pective to balance the presentation of ideas. However, the bottomline is th=
at it is never possible to articulate this knowledge perfectly, using vaikh=
ari. Knowledge like this can be digested and absorbed only though experienc=
e and not through reading or hearing words spoken in vaikhari. But then, wo=
rds spoken in vaikhari can serve the important purpose of inspiring one, pe=
rhaps to investigate and/or to do sadhana.
 
There is no alternative to sad=
hana, whether meditation or homam or contemplation or hatha yoga or whateve=
r.

Reli=
gion has two purposes: (1) Enable some seekers to experience Self and becom=
e liberated and (2) maintain some sanity, righteousness and order in the wo=
rld.
 
If there is no concept of god, no faith in god and no faith in after=
-life, world can then degenerate into adharmik, selfish and animalistic pur=
suit of selfish needs of each person. However corrupted, religion and fear =
of god bring some sanity and order to the world!
 
It is true that some rel=
igions and some ideas of god may have degenerated very badly and causing mo=
re harm than benefit. If so, such religions and ideas will be cleaned up by=
 the Natural Order when time comes, to be replaced by better ideas.
