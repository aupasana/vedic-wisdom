Namaste,

I'll add one point.

Even if you get a highly competent astrologer to give you a muhurta, it is
possible for that astrologer to overlook a factor and give you a bad
muhurta. Our knowledge is quite fallible. Moreover, a muhurta considered
good by one astrologer may be considered bad by another. There is no
uniformity in the available knowledge. And you cannot say that knowledge of
one person is correct and that of another is wrong. Everybody has some
correct knowledge and some incorrect knowledge.

Nevertheless, when you have a chance, you can follow the words of
astrologer(s) you trust. But, when it is not possible or when you have 
already
done something, do not worry about it at all.

In general, a full Moon day is auspicious for sadhana. In any case, good
luck!

Best regards,
Narasimha
