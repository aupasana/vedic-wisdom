Namaste Sir,

Yes, you can offer =
them to Mars. Some people also offer whole toor dal 
for Mars (small pigeon=
 peas).

*        *        *

This reminds me of one incident. In my daily =
Chandi homam, one of the 
standard substances I offer is dried Tulsi (holy =
basil) leaves, bought 
at a local Indian store. Though Tulasi is dear to Vi=
shnu, She is said to 
be disliked by Ganesha (there is a Puranic story for =
that). So, Tulasi 
leaves are nishiddha (prohibited) as an offering to Gane=
sha. I usually 
stick to all the rules I am aware of. So I offer Tulasi onl=
y to the 
Mother and never to Ganesha.

One Friday during last navaratris, =
I took a day off from work and spent 
it in a special sadhana. I spent from=
 early morning till 2 pm doing 
homam to Lakshmi and Narayana with continuo=
us repetition of Narayana 
Hridayam and Lakshmi Hridayam and then spent the=
 rest of the day 
chanting the same pair of stotras over and over again. In=
 the beginning 
of the day, when I was making offerings to Ganesha in fire,=
 I put Tulasi 
leaves in fire unconsciously (they were next to me and I gra=
bbed them 
without thinking). After making the offering, I realized my mist=
ake, and 
mentally apologized. But I got a clear sense that there was nothi=
ng 
wrong or nothing to worry. Moreover, I had my best experience ever 
dur=
ing homam, on that day.

*        *        *

Do the sadhana with a simple,=
 innocent and pure heart, without expecting 
any selfish results. Then, wha=
tever you do, whether granted by 
scriptures or prohibited, will become a p=
ure offering to the Lord. The 
physical materials we offer to Lord are just=
 a proxy and the real 
offering is our attitude and thoughts that accompany=
 them. Of course, 
follow the rules when you can, but do not worry too much=
 about the 
proxy. Worry about the real offering instead!

*        *      =
  *

If one thinks and analyzes too much, the onus is on that person to 
an=
alyze correctly and come to the right conclusion. If one is too 
knowledgea=
ble, the onus is on that person to apply the knowledge.

One who is not tha=
t knowledgeable and does not think much and simply 
does sadhana with a sim=
ple and innocent attitude and a sense of 
surrender is blessed. The onus is=
 on guru and Lord to make that person 
cross the ocean of samsara.

Best re=
gards,
Narasimha
