Yes, god is both dual and non-dual, but that is besides the point. Whether one is viewing god as dual or non-dual, it is the dense duality that one is stuck in, which blocks one from reaching god.
 
A normal person sees some things as desirable, some as undesirable, some as pleasurable, some as painful, some as attractive, some as repulsive etc. This dense duality that the mind is deeply immersed in stops one from realizing and reaching god, whether you are talking about dual god or non-dual god.
 
When a dwaiti (dualist) overcomes this dense duality and reaches god, all things and people start to seem as reflections of god. In dwaita, the actual god is 'distinct' from all these people, but all people are reflections of that same god. If god is like Sun, all people are like mirrors reflecting Sun. Before god realization, one sees so many good and bad things in all those people and feels various emotions such as attraction, repulsion, love, hatred, pride, anger, admiration, resentment, frustration, lust, jealosy etc. After god realization, one sees god in all those people and experiences great bliss.
 
When an adwaiti (non-dualist) overcomes this dense duality and reaches his concept of god, he and all beings merge in the non-dual god and he too reaches a different state of bliss.
 
In *either* case, before realizing god, one has to first overcome the dense duality of one's mental conditioning and overcome the difference between pleasure and pain, attraction and repulsion etc (refer to Krishna's words in Bhagavad Gita - "duHkheShvanudvignamanaaH sukheShu vigataspRhaH vIta raaga bhaya krodhaH sthitadhIrmunirucyate"). In either case, one does not overcome any "concept of non-duality" as you say. One overcomes the grosser dimensions of duality to reach either a sublime and subtle state of duality or non-duality.
 
Knowledge that makes one realize god (irrespective of whether "god" means the dual god or the non-dual Self for one) is the supreme knowledge and others inferior. Each Mahavidya take one to that supreme knowledge in a different route.

Planets are mapped to many deities for various purposes. But they are not "equated".
 
But Parasara specifically *equated* planets to Vishnu's avataras. And tantra has specifically equated avataras to mahavidyas, by using the word "saakshaat" (literally). There is further credence to this from saints like Ramakrishna who explicitly claimed based on direct experience that Krishna and Kaali were essentially non-different, just as sun and sunlight or gold and its goldness aren't different.
 
Thus, the link between planets, Vishnu's dasaavataras and dasa mahavidyas are different from all other planetary mappings we may encounter in astrology.

Does Tara Tantra say that Vasishtha worshipped Tara specifically "to attain the fruit of good children"?

(1) The part "it was because of Tara's blessing that" is someone's interpretation/extrapolation and not necessarily a fact. Yes, Vasishtha got a prolific grandson (Parasara). But the fact is that he lost all his hundred sons. He was so disheartened, as per Mahabharata, that he tried to kill himself when Shakti and all his brothers were killed. But divine forces stopped him. Later he found out that his daughter-in-law was pregnant and lived on to raise and guide grandson Parasara. If Tara is Jupiter and Tara's blessings give children, why did a great sadhaka of Tara lose all his 100 children?
 
(2) A lot of Hindus worship Lord Krishna, among all Vishnu avataras, to get progeny. Shall we say that putrakaraka Jupiter shows Krishna and not Vaamana as Parasara said when equating planets to Vishnu's avataras?
 
BTW, one can note that Vasishtha who is associated with Taaraa as one of Her greatest sadhakas is also associated with Lord Raama. Raama is also known as Taaraka Raama and his mantra is called a "Taaraka mantra". And tantra equates Raama (and not Vaamana) with Taaraa.
 
*        *        *
 
If you go to a great astrologer like Pt Sanjay Rath or Sri KN Rao, there are specific advanced things in astrology that you can learn from them. Of course, if you only want to learn how to add 2 and 3 or how to count the 4th house from Moon, they will be able to teach you that also. But that will be a waste and you are not really taking advantage of the "great astrologer" in them. If one learns how to add 2 and 3 or how to count the 4th house from Moon from them, one cannot really claim "I learnt astrology from a great astrologer".
 
Similarly, mahavidyas are for supreme knowledge. If people with material problems ask them for a child or money or victory in litigation etc, that will be a waste. If one is praying to Kaali or Tripura or Bhuvaneshwari or Lakshmi for some specific material thing, one is not really propitiating a Mahavidya. One is essentially trying to propitiate a limited aspect of a goddess who can *also* be propitiated *as* a Mahavidya.
 
Mahavidya worship used to be secretive sand limited to sadhakas who overcame most of the weaknesses and are somewhat ready for realizing god. It is not for everyone. The tendency among some astrologers these days to use some horoscopic thumbrules to suggest a specific mahavidya mantra to anyone and everyone is troublesome.
 
There are many deities, mantras and sadhanas that are appropriate for people stuck in (and sensitive to) material problems. When one becomes less interested in those things and develops a strong desire to realize god is one ready for a Mahavidya. But Mahavidyas are being prescribed indiscriminately by some astrologers today.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
