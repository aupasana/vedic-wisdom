Namaste KK,

Individual soul is represented by Sun. Individual mind is represented by 
Moon. When the light of the soul is visible fully, it is the day spiritually 
speaking. When the light of the soul is not visible fully and visible in an 
indirect way as reflected by the mind (just as Sun's light is reflected by 
Moon), it is the night spiritually speaking.

When the mind is absorbed in all attractions and repulsions, nice sense 
experiences, pleasures and pains etc and one is unable to see true Self in 
all, light of the soul is not reaching one and a limited amount of that 
light is reaching one as reflected by the mind. Spiritually speaking, this 
is a night.

Yes, veda mantras are better read at day than at night. But the day and 
night meant there are as above. If one's self-awareness is completely 
through the relfective mind which is caught in sense experiences and has 
only a limited understanding of the universe, then one will not be able to 
experience or understand veda mantras and most higher mantras. Only one 
transcending sense experiences and having a higher self-awareness is living 
in spiritual "daytime" will be able to experience and understand veda 
mantras.

This way, most people are living in dark night all the time and unable to 
experience or understand veda mantras.

Whether it is daytime or night time physically matters very little. If night 
time is convenient for you, I suggest not worrying and reading/listening to 
veda mantras at night.

Practically speaking, there is a caveat: If there is ANY sense of guilt or 
your mind has a sense that you are doing something wrong, then don't do it. 
That sense of guilt will corrupt everything. If you can genuinely convince 
yourself that there is nothing wrong it, then do it.

Best regards,
Narasimha

> I some times put on the some vedic chants during night and while listening
