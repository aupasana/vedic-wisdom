Namaste,

I am glad. Good luck for future.

(1) Yes.

(2) Yes. =
If you say atharva seersham 8 times, you are putting 8x10 aahutis. 
First 7=
9 aahutis are with swaaha and the final aahuti in the 8th time 
chanting (8=
0th aahuti) is with vaushat.

(3) Yes, flower petals and fruits or fruit sl=
ices can be offered. But make 
sure that your fire is big enough to burn th=
em. I am not sure the what they 
signify.

(4) Yes, you can. You can give g=
ive different items as aahuti in each 
swaahaa.

(5) Vishnu sahasra naamam =
(1000 names of Vishnu) is a very powerful prayer. 
It was revealed to the w=
orld bu Dharmaraja and Bhishma just before Kali yuga 
came, because it was =
to play an important role in Kali yuga. My guru asked 
me to spread Vishnu =
sahasra naama homam. That will come soon. I will give 
one for Shiva also.
=

Best regards,
Narasimha
