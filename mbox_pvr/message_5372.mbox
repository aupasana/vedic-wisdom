Dear Narasimha,

You are correct, this is not a forum on science, therefore=
 this discussing need 
not have taken place at all. My apologies. However, =
when someone/anyone tries to 
sell any idea on the basis of=C2=A0science, i=
t needs to stand scrutiny. The first 
email which prompted me to reply, was=
 based on so called 'science'.

Science provides data points and people con=
struct a big picture based on those 
data points based on their agenda. Thi=
s applies to all.
In fact, in several areas of study, unfortunately science=
 itself is today 
governed by various political and capitalistic agendas.
=
=C2=A0
While this is correct in some cases, it is not correct in all cases.=
 The=C2=A0key 
to=C2=A0objectivity=C2=A0is not blanketing everyone in one b=
rush, but judging every 
instance on it's specific merits and evidences. In=
 this case though the evidence 
is quite compelling. =C2=A0Your reply=C2=A0=
clearly shows that you have not gone through 
the evidences in details. I s=
tand by my observation - which I gained the hard 
way - that the 'science' =
touted in vegan sites are a mixture of fallacious 
arguments through cherry=
 picking=C2=A0and=C2=A0balderdash. 

=C2=A0
The problem is not with science=
 or researchers per se. A reseracher merely looks 
at the evidence, and pla=
ces them in order. The problem is when people want to 
prove something for =
whatever reason,=C2=A0and thus look at the evidences with 
coloured glasses=
, accepting and rejecting based on convenience. For example all 
this brouh=
aha about homosexuality being natural is a political agenda. There is 
enou=
gh scientifc evidence that homosexuality is not a "natural" phenomenon in 
=
animal world, though occassionally such behaviour is displayed due to diffe=
rent 
factors,=C2=A0and in humans it can be reversed.=C2=A0Science is=C2=A0=
far from conclusive 
about=C2=A0this issue.=C2=A0But the disease of being=
=C2=A0politically correct has put a lid on 
these evidences and given an en=
tirely different spin to it. 

=C2=A0
Research by definition is honest, it =
is those with an agenda who mess things up. 

=C2=A0
But it is not a good i=
dea to let it control your thinking. Modern science is not 
worthy enough.
=

Thank you for your advise. I shall keep this in mind, though I am not a bl=
ind 
supporter of science at all. However, I do not reject science as being=
 all 
incorrect. What is correct or incorrect can only be judged, IMHO, by =
unbiased, 
open minded self study. 

=C2=A0
Your other email on depression =

 to create a picture. That is why they are always evolving and 
changing.
=
=C2=A0
Well this maybe true, but there is more to it. Nothing can be accept=
ed or 
dismissed without scrutiny. For example, the same evolutionary ideas=
, specially 
evolutionary anthropology, quite clearly establishes that huma=
n population had 
been existing in the Indian subcontinent, atleast,=C2=A0s=
ince the last ice age. The 
whole of AIT and AMT gets shattered. 

=C2=A0
L=
ong back, there had been erruptions of some supervolcanoes near India, as i=
n 
other parts of the world too, which covered the whole subcontinent and t=
he areas 
around it with thick volcanic ashes for a good 5/6 years, killing=
 and reducing 
the population to a mere 10,000. The most dangerous part of =
this ash is what 
stayed in the air and cut off oxygen. One day I was discu=

when he suggested an interesting idea. When such a=

=C2=A0

=C2=A0 
Namaste,

Th=
is is a forum for spirituality and not for modern science. Scientific point=
s 
may be mentioned on the sidelines, but cannot be beaten to death.

* * *=


In any case, please remember that science addresses well-defined problems=
 that 
have a very narrow focus. Unfortunately, complex problems of life ca=
n often not 
be defined in such a narrow manner. As a result, what happens =
is that scientists 
honestly and accurately state their narrow conclusions =
and those who apply that 
knowledge end up extrapolating a bit. That is why=
 one scientific research may 
conclude that so and so medicine helps depres=
sion and another research may later 
conclude that the same medicine may ma=
ke depressed people commit suicide and the 
medicine may be recalled!

Abso=
rption of proteins, as indicated by BV that was discussed here, for example=
, 
is just one factor. Absorption of various nutrients, their interplay, th=
eir 
distribution in the system, their impact on metabolism, anabolism and =
catabolism 
etc, are not fully understood by modern science. Modern science=
 could only 
capture a data point here and a data point there, but not the =
full holistic 
picture.

 most planet based products.

The issue is not the ease of digestion. I did=
 not say "foods that are tougher to 
digest", but instead used the expressi=
on "foods that light up a higher digestive 
agni".

For example, cooked car=
rots with black pepper powder and green chillies light up 
higher agni than=
 cooked carrots with just some coriander powder (and no other 
heavier spic=
e) and are easier to digest. The latter is consider more saattwik, 
because=
 it lights up less agni for its digestion.

Some other food like softly coo=
ked onions, for example, may be very easy to 
digest and light up very litt=
le agni in stomach, but when nutrients in it are 
ditributed in the body, t=
hey light up a strong agni elsewhere in the body. Agni 
(fire) is transform=
ative energy and so many transformations of matter are 
occurring everywher=
e in the body. For example, production of various enzymes and 
hormones in =
the body involves different kinds of agni. Ayurveda enumerates tens 
of dif=
ferent kinds of agni at the physical level alone. There are all kinds of 
c=
onnections between these agnis and the food we eat.

When it comes to food =
that is just sufficient for survival, conserves internal 
agni and facilita=
tes faster spiritual development, ayurveda and Indian yogic 
tradition offe=
r far more holistic theories than modern science can. As I said, 
modern sc=
ience captures a data point here and a data point there and not a 
holistic=
 picture. Of course, people like you may want to study modern science 
crit=
ically in order to prepare themselves for possible debates of future. But i=
t 
is not a good idea to let it control your thinking. Modern science is no=
t worthy 
enough.

* * *

> .. vegan websites etc .. they merely cherrry pi=
ck from researches

Science provides da=
ta points and people construct a big picture based on those 
data points ba=
sed on their agenda. This applies to all.

In fact, in several areas of stu=
dy, unfortunately science itself is today 
governed by various political an=
d capitalistic agendas.

* * *

Regarding the NPR interview I mentioned, I =
only heard the interview with the 
researcher on radio. I did not read abou=
t it and hence do not know about their 
publications. The research took gor=
illas (or perhaps chimpanzees) that were 
comparable in various ways and di=
d a controlled experiment over a period of 
time. The explanation in terms =
of brain development was only a speculation. The 
only real scientific conc=
lusion of theirs was that eating vegetarian diet over a 
period of time mad=
e them smarter.

* * *

> Scientists studying evolution and human body stru=

sciences. But, I have limited respect for other 
speculative and extrapolat=
ory sciences. They seem to take a few points and

e a picture. That is why they are always evolving and

Modern sc=
ientific understanding of how human life evolved may or may not be 
perfect=
. I am not convinced by any of their conclusions.

If I say that there were=
 great civilizations 7 million years ago, great kings 
who ruled earth and =
people lived orderly lives of happiness and bliss, modern 
science will dis=
agree. Mainly because they do not have evidence. But I see no 
evidence to =
the contrary either.

> This cannot be done consciously, but only by the wo=

Natural forces facilita=
te both suric and asuric (divine and demonic) forces that 
are constantly p=
ulling the universe in different directions. Nature favors 
demonic forces =
at times and divine forces at times, but divine forces in the 
long run. Gr=
eat demons ruled earth for thousands of years in the past. When 
demonic th=
oughts were prevalent, no rishi or god who came to earth said, "this 
is th=

=
and changed things. The predominant thinking of this age that vegetarianism=

"unnatural" and inefficient, to me, indicates a temporary domination o=

thought. It needs to be defeated by hook or crook.

<P>The problem is not with science or researchers per se.=
 A reseracher merely looks at the evidence, and places them in order. The p=
roblem is when people want to prove something for whatever reason, and=
 thus look at the evidences with coloured glasses, accepting and rejecting =
based on convenience. For example all this brouhaha about homosexuality bei=
ng natural is a political agenda. There is enough scientifc evidence that h=
omosexuality is not a "natural" phenomenon in animal world, though occassio=
nally such behaviour is displayed due to different factors, and in hum=
ans it can be reversed. Science is far from conclusive about =
;this issue. But the disease of being politically correct has put=
 a lid on these evidences and given an entirely different spin to it. </P>

<P> </P>
<P>Research by definition is honest, it is those with an agen=
da who mess things up. </P>
<P> </P>
<P><EM>But it is not a good idea =
to let it control your thinking. Modern science is not worthy enough.</EM><=
BR></P>
<P>Thank you for your advise. I shall keep this in mind, though I a=
m not a blind supporter of science at all. However, I do not reject science=
 as being all incorrect. What is correct or incorrect can only be judged, I=
MHO, by unbiased, open minded self study. </P>
<P> </P>
<P>Your other =
email on depression is true. Psychology/psychiatry/neurology are very, very=
 grey areas where modern science is just a toddler. </P=

<P> </P>
<P><EM>I respect fundamental sciences. But, I have limited =
respect for other speculative and extrapolatory sciences. They seem to take=
 a few points and extrapolate them to create a picture. That is why they ar=
e always evolving and changing.</EM></P>
<P><EM></EM> </P>
<P>Well thi=
s maybe true, but there is more to it. Nothing can be accepted or dismissed=
 without scrutiny. For example, the same evolutionary ideas, specially evol=
utionary anthropology, quite clearly establishes that human population had =
been existing in the Indian subcontinent, atleast, since the last ice =
age. The whole of AIT and AMT gets shattered. </P>
<P> </P>
<P>Long ba=
ck, there had been erruptions of some supervolcanoes near India, as in othe=
r parts of the world too, which covered the whole subcontinent and the area=
s around it with thick volcanic ashes for a good 5/6 years, killing and red=
ucing the population to a mere 10,000. The most dangerous part of this ash =
is what stayed in the air and cut off oxygen. One day I was discussing this=
 with Manish, when he suggested an interesting idea. When such an erruption=
 occures, the reason how and why some people in some areas survived, m=
aybe be due to fire worship. Homas/yagyas done effectively can force r=
ainfall and clear the air for breathing.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Some day a gr=
eat educationalist should change the whole system of studies in India. Hist=
ory needs to be taken out of the clutches of "arts" and coupled with archae=
logy and evolutionary studies. Had it been so, many of our histor=
ians would not have remained so ignorant about ancient history.</P>
<P>&nbs=
p;</P>
<P><EM>Natural forces facilitate both suric and asuric (divine and d=
emonic) forces that are constantly pulling the universe in different direct=
ions. Nature favors demonic forces at times and divine forces at times, but=
 divine forces in the long run. Great demons ruled earth for thousands of y=
ears in the past. When demonic thoughts were prevalent, no rishi or god who=
 came to earth said, "this is the work of natural forces and so it must be =
good". Instead, they fought it and changed things. The predominant thinking=
 of this age that vegetarianism is "unnatural" and inefficient, to me, indi=
cates a temporary domination of asuric thought. It needs to be defeated by =
hook or crook</EM>.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Best of luck to you. </P>
<P> =
;</P>
<P>However, I cannot agree with you since there are too many dif=
ficult questions for which there are no answers or unconvincing&n=
bsp;answers, IMO, as yet,  from those who say vegeterianism is mo=
re natural for humans. Of course, I personally am a vegeterian and will rem=
ain so, unless I am specifically asked not be one.</P>

<P>Namaste,<BR><BR>T=
his is a forum for spirituality and not for modern science. Scientific poin=
ts may be mentioned on the sidelines, but cannot be beaten to death.<BR><BR=
>* * *<BR><BR>In any case, please remember that science addresses well-defi=
ned problems that have a very narrow focus. Unfortunately, complex problems=
 of life can often not be defined in such a narrow manner. As a result, wha=
t happens is that scientists honestly and accurately state their narrow con=
clusions and those who apply that knowledge end up extrapolating a bit. Tha=
t is why one scientific research may conclude that so and so medicine helps=
 depression and another research may later conclude that the same medicine =
may make depressed people commit suicide and the medicine may be recalled!<=
BR><BR>Absorption of proteins, as indicated by BV that was discussed here, =
for example, is just one factor. Absorption of various nutrients, their int=
erplay, their distribution in the system, their
 impact on metabolism, anab=
olism and catabolism etc, are not fully understood by modern science. Moder=
n science could only capture a data point here and a data point there, but =
not the full holistic picture. <BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>> This is a wrong th=
eory as far as human nutrition is concerned, because human<BR>> stomach =
structure (gut morphology) is such that it finds certain animal products<BR=
>> far easier to digest than most planet based products.<BR><BR>The issu=
e is not the ease of digestion. I did not say "foods that are tougher to di=
gest", but instead used the expression "foods that light up a higher digest=
ive agni".<BR><BR>For example, cooked carrots with black pepper powder and =
green chillies light up higher agni than cooked carrots with just some cori=
ander powder (and no other heavier spice) and are easier to digest. The lat=
ter is consider more saattwik, because it lights up less agni for its diges=
tion.<BR><BR>Some other food like softly
 cooked onions, for example, may b=
e very easy to digest and light up very little agni in stomach, but when nu=
trients in it are ditributed in the body, they light up a strong agni elsew=
here in the body. Agni (fire) is transformative energy and so many transfor=
mations of matter are occurring everywhere in the body. For example, produc=
tion of various enzymes and hormones in the body involves different kinds o=
f agni. Ayurveda enumerates tens of different kinds of agni at the physical=
 level alone. There are all kinds of connections between these agnis and th=
e food we eat.<BR><BR>When it comes to food that is just sufficient for sur=
vival, conserves internal agni and facilitates faster spiritual development=
, ayurveda and Indian yogic tradition offer far more holistic theories than=
 modern science can. As I said, modern science captures a data point here a=
nd a data point there and not a holistic picture. Of course, people like yo=
u may want to study modern science
 critically in order to prepare themselv=
es for possible debates of future. But it is not a good idea to let it cont=
rol your thinking. Modern science is not worthy enough.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR=
>> .. vegan websites etc .. they merely cherrry pick from researches<BR>=
> That is politics and not science!<BR><BR>Science provides data points =
and people construct a big picture based on those data points based on thei=
r agenda. This applies to all.<BR><BR>In fact, in several areas of study, u=
nfortunately science itself is today governed by various political and capi=
talistic agendas.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Regarding the NPR interview I mention=
ed, I only heard the interview with the researcher on radio. I did not read=
 about it and hence do not know about their publications. The research took=
 gorillas (or perhaps chimpanzees) that were comparable in various ways and=
 did a controlled experiment over a period of time. The explanation in term=
s of brain development was
 only a speculation. The only real scientific co=
nclusion of theirs was that eating vegetarian diet over a period of time ma=
de them smarter.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>> Scientists studying evolution and=
 human body structures have concluded that meat<BR>> eating along with c=
ropping and fruits has been prevelant since at least 4<BR>> million year=
s.<BR><BR>I respect fundamental sciences. But, I have limited respect for o=
ther speculative and extrapolatory sciences. They seem to take a few points=
 and extrapolate them to create a picture. That is why they are always evol=

 evolved may or may not be perfect. I am not convinced by any of their conc=
lusions.<BR><BR>If I say that there were great civilizations 7 million year=

ess and bliss, modern science will disagree. Mainly because they do not hav=

 see no evidence to the contrary either.<BR><BR>> This=

 food. A few quick comments.<BR>=
><BR>> (1) We are we we eat. Production of various chemicals in our b=
ody and their<BR>> interactions, are controlled by what we eat. Thus, wh=
at we eat has a profound<BR>> impact on us.<BR>><BR>> (2) Much has=
 been written on the material benefits from vegetarianism. But that<BR>>=
 is not all. There are spiritual and subtle reasons as well.<BR>><BR>>=
; Eating the flesh or body parts of an animal that strongly identifies with=
 the<BR>> physical body entails a karma. Self-identification of plants w=
ith their physical<BR>> body is much subtler and the karma entailed in e=
ating plant-based foods is much<BR>> smaller.<BR>><BR>> Especially=
 these days, very cruel methods are used for meat production by<BR>> cor=
porations and animals are treated very cruelly. Part of the karma for their=
<BR>> suffering goes to the ones benefiting from their meat.<BR>><BR>=
> (3) I heard an interview with a
 scientist on NPR (National Public Rad=
io) several<BR>> months back. They conducted an experiment on gorillas. =
One set of gorillas was<BR>> fed with meat. The other set was fed with n=
uts, fruits etc. After several<BR>> months, researchers found a gap in t=
he intelligence of the two sets. The ones<BR>> fed with meat were duller=
.<BR>><BR>> Their theory was that digestion of meat takes up more ene=
rgy. Gorillas fed with<BR>> nuts and fruits may have diverted more energ=
y towards the development of brain.<BR>> Though they were not sure if th=
e same thing applies to human beings or not, a<BR>> balanced vegetarian =
diet perhaps can maximize one's intellectual development.<BR>><BR>> (=
4) After we eat a heavy meal, we may feel dull or sleepy and cannot focus w=
ell<BR>> on work that requires alertness and skill. That is because the =
digestive process<BR>> is using up a lot of energy (also known as agni o=
r fire) and there isn't
 much<BR>> agni available for other activities s=
uch as digestion of intellectual ideas that<BR>> happens in the mind. Si=
milarly, digestion of spiritual ideas/experiences also<BR>> requires agn=
i and that cannot happen well. That is why meditation or homam after<BR>>=
; a heavy meal are fruitless and we are normally advised to do sadhana befo=
re<BR>> eating.<BR>><BR>> (5) If foods that light up a higher dige=
stive agni (e.g. meats, deep fried food<BR>> with more oil, spicy foods =
that stimulate digestive agni etc) are consumed more<BR>> frequently, ag=
ni is diverted towards digestion more often and there is less agni<BR>> =
available for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and experiences=
. If<BR>> one eats saattwik food that is very easy to digest (simple gra=
ins, simple<BR>> lentils and simple vegetables, all softly cooked with m=
ild spices, and fruits),<BR>> less agni is diverted towards digestion an=
d more agni is
 available for<BR>> assimilaring intellectual and spiritu=
al ideas and experiences.<BR>><BR>> (6) Even a big fire cannot burn w=
et grass well. But huge stacks of dry grass may<BR>> be burnt by just on=
e spark! Similarly, little bit of internal fire may be enough<BR>> to as=
similate spiritual ideas and experiences in a person with excellent<BR>>=
 vaasanas and few obstructions (dry grass). A lot of internal fire may be n=
eeded<BR>> in a person with poor vaasanas and many obstructions (wet gra=
ss). Thus, it all<BR>> depends on vaasanas and impurities in nadis and c=
hakras.<BR>><BR>> One person may eat meat and deep fried foods, spend=
 a lot of agni on digesting<BR>> them and yet make excellent spiritual p=
rogress. Another person may eat saattwik<BR>> food, maximize the agni av=
ailable for spiritual transformation and yet struggle<BR>> to progress s=
piritually. However, the best course of action for one is to ignore<BR>>=

 counter-examples and be a vegetarian. All other things being equal, that<=
BR>> maximizes the agni available for spiritual progress.<BR>><BR>>=
; (7) Regarding Priya's question: Animals have their own vaasanas and their=
 needs.<BR>> If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwis=
e, feed the poor<BR>> fellow whatever he/she needs.<BR>><BR>> (8) =
One should eat to live and not live to eat. A yogi should consume enough<BR=
>> food to sustain oneself so that one can fulfil one's dharma in the ma=
terial<BR>> world using physical body and make spiritual progress. Eatin=
g too much food is<BR>> not good for spiritual sadhana.<BR>><BR>> =
Instead of overeating most of the time and fasting on specific days, it is<=
BR>> better to eat limited amount always. Regular practices are more imp=
ortant for<BR>> transformation and success, than occasional practices.<B=
R>><BR>> (9) By merely thinking that god is the doer of all
 actions =
or considering food<BR>> to be god's prasad, one cannot escape the karma=
 involved. It depends on how<BR>> deeply ingrained that thought is and h=
ow deeply one feels so. If one internally<BR>> feels 100% that god is ac=
