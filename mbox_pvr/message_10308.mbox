Namaste Sir,

If one believes that certain actions are too impure to be off=
ered to Lord, one can of course avoid those actions and perform actions tha=
t one believes are worthy of being offered to Lord.

However, I'd make such=
 a judgment on only myself and modify MY actions. I wouldn't be prejudiced =
about someone els's actions. Someone else may be able to perform an action =
that I'd consider very impure and yet be able to offer it to Lord whole-hea=
rtedly. If one does that, Lord may indeed accept the action (and grant libe=
ration). Who are we to second guess Lord?


*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *

> Its almost like approving the Devdasi system.
Who am I=
 (or who are you) to approve or disapprove anything?


The circumstances pe=
ople end up in are dependent on their actions and desires from the past.Exe=
rting freewill within the constraints of those circumstances, people engage=
 in new actions and entertain new desires.These new actions and desires bec=
ome the foundation for future life circumstances. This cycle goes on as lon=
g as there are some desires.

After going through many lives with many circ=
umstances, actions and desires, one may reach a desireless state. After tha=
t, actions may continue based on previous momentum and different circumstan=
ces may ensure as a result. But, eventually actions cease in the absence of=
 desires.

Irrespective of whether others approve or not, people who have o=
btained the right balance between life circumstances, actions and desires w=
ill reach that desireless state. There are examples in scripture of even a =
cholera virus becoming liberated. Why not then a human being, in spite of b=
eing in terrible circumstances?

Again, if you believe certain people are t=
oo impure to make spiritual progress and their actions too impure to be off=
ered to lord, you can avoid those people and those actions.


*=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *

Dharma and moksha are different. Dharma=
 comes with rules for maintaining an order in the society. There are univer=
sal dharmas and there are subtle personal dharmas that change from person t=
o person. But the purpose of all dharma is to maintain some orderliness.
Fo=
llowing dharma is very important if one wants moksha. But moksha is about *=
non-volitional spontaneity* rather than following rules.

If one does not f=
ollow rules, *volition* does not cease. One can be spontaneous, but it may =
not be *non-volitional*. On the other hand, if one keeps following rules, o=
ne will keep following them for ever and spontaneity may never develop.

Th=
e leap from strictly following rules to non-volitional spontaneity is not e=
asy..

Best regards,

Narasimha
