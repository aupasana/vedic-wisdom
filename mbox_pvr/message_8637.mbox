Namaste,
=A0
There are many spiritual practices that increase one's spiritu=
al strength, just as there are many foods that increase one's physical stre=
ngth.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *

Do you get mo=
re strength by eating cashews, raisins, fruits and milk or by eating cooked=
 rice, dal and vegetables or by eating chapati and curries or sandwiches or=
 pasta or so many other styles of food?
=A0
It is possible to get balanced =
nutrition through each style. However, if one likes chapati and curries, fo=
rcing one to eat pasta may not work. If one likes grilled sandwiches, forci=
ng one to eat rice and dal may not work.
=A0
Similarly, do you get more spi=
ritual strength by doing homam with a mantra or japam with a mantra or pran=
ayama with a mantra or so many sadhana paths?
=A0
It is possible to get bal=
anced spiritual progress through each path. However, if one likes singing p=
rayers, forcing one to do pranayama may not work. If one likes japam, forci=
ng one to do homam may not work.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
What style of food one eats, how many times a day one eats,=
 how much food one eats each time is secondary (though it matters too). How=
 well one is enjoying food and digesting it is primary.
=A0
Similarly, what=
 sadhana one does, how many years one does sadhana for and how many hours o=
ne spends in sadhana everyday is secondary (though it matters too). How inv=
olved one is in and how much one is enjoying sadhana is primary.
=A0
If one=
 finds a sadhana that one can enjoy and engage in without forcing oneself m=
echanically and if one feels love and attachment to the tools, symbols and =
steps involved in that sadhana, one is lucky. Otherwise, one may engage in =
a sadhana mechanically for a long time without making much progress.
=A0
Bu=
t, realize that one may have to try many cuisines before finding what one r=
eally loves. Secondly, one may dislike a cuisine at first and slowly get ho=
oked. All these variables are there. But, eventually, one needs to enjoy wh=
at one is eating, to digest well. Similarly, one needs to eventually start =
enjoying one's sadhana, to progress spiritually.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Having said that, fire is something separate =
and special. Almost every ancient culture and civilization worshipped god i=
n sacred fire.
=A0
No matter what kind of food one eats, eating some ginger=
 can provoke one's appetite and make one digest better. Similarly, no matte=
r what kind of sadhana one does, doing some fire worship can provoke one's =
internal fire and make one digest better.
=A0
Also, just as a good nutritio=
nist working with one can help one in picking the right balance of foods, a=
 good guru or mentor working with one can help one in picking the right bal=
ance of sadhanas.
=A0
So a good guru/mentor and company of fire are two thi=
ngs that put one in good stead, irrespective of what else one does.
=A0
*=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *

I do not like to comment=
 on specific people or organizations. But, I'd *in general* be suspicious o=
f anyone who says they have a special and effective spiritual path, then co=
ntrols and guards the details tightly and puts a price on it. That is not t=
he way of rishis. That is not the way of Sanatana Dharma.
=A0
But if one tr=
ies such a path and benefits, good for them. I'd personally stay away from =
such organizations.
=A0
BTW, I am not a "guruji", though I answered your qu=
estion.
