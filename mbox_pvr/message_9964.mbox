Namaste friends,
=C2=A0
I am quoting an excerpt from a private email on thi=
s topic from Dr Robert Svoboda, author of Aghora series books, with his per=
mission:
=C2=A0
"I am convinced that Fire itself is a living entity. 
Relat=
ing to Fire can be a mechanical process, but if that is all it is, 
the pot=
ential benefit is substantially attenuated, as it is when one 
relates only=
 mechanically to any other living entity. One ideally 
develops a relations=
hip with the Fire (as with all the other elements), 
instead of simply empl=
oying those elements in the service of what one 
imagines is one's practice=
. 

"It is immaterial to me if anyone else feels that it is OK to drown the=
ir
 fire with milk after they have had their way with it. I have my own 
re=
lationship with Fire, and am not overly concerned with anyone else's. I
 am=
 sure that it is possible that they could develop a relationship with
 Fire=
 in which Fire would feel OK about being smothered with milk at the
 end of=
 a homa, but why? If you & I are relating in some way & 
you tell me that I=
 must do something that is inimical to my nature, like
 smear my body with =
lard each time that we meet, I may agree to such a 
stipulation if I am ver=
y much interested in relating with you =E2=80=93 but I 
will still think it=
 is unnecessary (and, frankly, foolish). 

"Fire
 is different from the oth=
er elements. All the others have been part of 
the daily experience of all =
protoplasmic beings since the beginning of 
life on earth. But until very r=
ecently, the only times living beings 
experienced fire was at a volcano, o=
r after lightning struck a dead 
tree. All animals are instinctively terrif=
ied of fire. Only humans have 
learned to harness it (more or less), and on=
ly since then (about one 
million years ago) have we really become =E2=80=
=9Chumans=E2=80=9D - for which we owe a 
great debt to Fire. Without Fire (=
which after all rules Form), how could
 any deities ever have taken on Rupa=
? With Fire, The Supreme can appear 
in so many guises, with so many names =
and faces =E2=80=93 and it is a wonderful 
thing to be able to perceive var=
ious divine entities simultaneously in 
Agni and in oneself."

=C2=A0
Best =

Narasimha
