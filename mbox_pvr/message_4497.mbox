Dear Shri.Rajarshi,
=C2=A0
1."Thank you for the interesting example above. =
But I have a very pertinent question regarding this.=C2=A0 And what exactly=
 does it mean by saying one learned in the Vedas? Can one, who=C2=A0has mug=
ged up the Vedas and a few commentaries of the same, without experiencing a=
ny sort of self-realization, be called a "srotriya"? Does such a non-realiz=
ed being have "fire" in his right hand? Never! "
=C2=A0
"Mugging up of veda=
s" - mugging of vedas is not like mugging up an engineering text book for t=
he exam. It is a sadhana in itself. upto 12-13 hours=C2=A0aday of mantra ch=
anting for 4 to 5 years coupled with one's nitya karma like sandhya vandana=
m, brahma yajnam, samidadhanam (the homa performed in the morning and eveni=
ng by the student). It involves santha, anusantha and avrutis. The sadhana =
continues until brahma (mantra) becomes his power (varchas) and thereafter =
for the rest of the life time. I have come across a scholar whose fingers k=
eep moving even in sleep in accordance with the rythm of the mantra. He has=
 transformed himself into the mantra. The veda is installed inside him. Thi=
s is no less than any sadhana we are speaking about.
=C2=A0
For this transf=
ormed being learning bhashya is not necessary. He knows even beforehand wha=
t is there in the bhashya and what it means in various planes.
=C2=A0
For i=
nformation, Sayana's commentaries are based on the nirukta (meaning of vedi=
c terms) of Yaska. Nirukta is one of the vedangas. If we call Sayana's comm=
entary a distortion, we will have to disown Yaska as well.
=C2=A0
2. "Vasis=
tha spoke the Yoga Vasistham"
=C2=A0
Who is the real author of yoga vasisht=
am Vasishta or Valmiki ?
=C2=A0
3. "The vedic rishis were famous for doing =
elaborate yagyas and homas. By extension of your above logic, it means they=
 did not believe in Advaita since they used to engage themselves in homas a=
nd yagyas?"
=C2=A0
Advaita ( or for that matter vedanta) is only one of the=
 six darsanas (or ways of looking at it). Dvaita, Vishitadvaita and Meemams=
a have different views. By Vedic rishis do you mean the=C2=A0rishis who com=
posed the veda mantras or the later ones also=C2=A0who philosphized on them=
. The views are not homogenous. The advaita vada is the most propagated one=
 among the general public and has great appeal . The other views also appea=
r to be equally valid if you read them. There were rishis who subscribed to=
 the advaita vada, and others who did not.=C2=A0 
=C2=A0
Yajno hi mantaeird=
evatamuddisya dravyasya daanam - Yajna is providing dravya to the devata wi=
th the mantra. This is another view.
=C2=A0
4. "Can you kindly enlighten us=
, why is Usha accorded an elevated status".
=C2=A0
No surpirse, That is the=
 essence of veda. Not only usha, amavasya, purnima. kuhu, sinivali, wind, r=
ain, cloud, vidyut,earth, fire, storm, water, medha (intellect), pranas,ous=
hadhis, vanaspatis, nakshatras, all are accorded elevated status. That's ho=
w veda is.
=C2=A0
5. "The way one can learn is different based on the diffe=
rent models of the aeroplanes in which one learns to fly!"
=C2=A0
If one ha=
s flying experience on a cessana alone he will not be allowed to fly a boei=
ng. This is why I said I am only against mixing up.
=C2=A0
6. "No. Many sel=
f-realized people have 'mixed' these artifically created boundaried and ach=
ived and experienced higher states. Anything that leads to God is good."
=
=C2=A0
They have been lucky. For each succesful one there may be many who h=
ave also failed miserably. If one with all purity and best of intentions=C2=
=A0gives ahutis =C2=A0water on agni instead of ghee, what will be the outco=
me ? Intention can not justify flouting of rules. Rules only support and pr=
omote intention.
=C2=A0
My only contention is that if you are performing a =
vedic ritual follow the rules laid down by the rishis and acharyas.
=C2=A0
=
God bless you.

Namaste Si=
ndhu ji,
=C2=A0
Although this mail is addressed to Narasimha, I had a few p=
oints to make since the mail is in the forum.
=C2=A0
and do not violate the=
 fundamental principles of vedic rituals.
=C2=A0
What exactly is the "funda=
mental principles" of a vedic ritual? In my little=C2=A0understanding, it i=
s the=C2=A0goal which is=C2=A0God-realization, which is the=C2=A0only=C2=A0=
"fundamental principle". Anything else is dispensable and therefore not ete=
rnal. Vedas, as all self-realized saints have told us, are about eternal tr=
uths, nothing short. 
=C2=A0
It will be interesting here to point out that =
when some sections of samavedis when they perform sraadham=C2=A0do the=C2=
=A0hormam on the palm of the bhokta brahmin. It is called panihomam. Even t=
he fire is not present there. It is based on a dictum called " brahmanasya =
dakshine haste hotavyam" - the homa is to be performed on the right hand of=
 the brahmin. It is believed that agni is ever present in the right hand of=
 the srotriya (one learned in the veda) brahmin. There is no defect here. I=
t is as per sastra. Now if you modify this and say that homa can be perfrom=
ed on the right glove worn by a brahmin, then the problem arises.
=C2=A0
Th=
ank you for the interesting example above. But I have a very pertinent ques=
tion regarding this.=C2=A0 And what exactly does it mean by saying one lear=
ned in the Vedas? Can one, who=C2=A0has mugged up the Vedas and a few comme=
ntaries of the same, without experiencing any sort of self-realization, be =
called a "srotriya"? Does such a non-realized being have "fire" in his righ=
t hand? Never! 
=C2=A0
A real "srotriya" is one who has realized the Aatman=
, not in words, but in the states of samadhi. Such a being "may have" spiri=
tual abilities of fire in his "palm". Anyone else, irrespective of whether =
he is=C2=A0born in=C2=A0brhamin family, is merely following a blind traditi=
on without having experienced anything and thus violating the essence of th=
e Vedas and merely sticking to external rules which have no spiritual conse=
quence. What use is such=C2=A0a=C2=A0'vedic' rituals, if at all they can be=
 called as vedic. That which is devoide of the essence, is an empty shell w=
hich is bound to reform or perish in the course of time. 
=C2=A0
Therefore,=
 for me, it hardly matters if the ritual is done on the bare palms or a glo=
ved hands of a person who has never experienced the Self. Both, are in clea=
r violation of the Vedic essence.
=C2=A0
Homam is a ritualistic form of wor=
ship and if you bring in advaita vada in it it doesn't work.
=C2=A0
This is=
 definitely incorrect! The vedic rishis were famous for doing elaborate yag=
yas and homas. By extension of your above logic, it means they did not beli=
eve in Advaita since they used to engage themselves in homas and yagyas?=C2=
=A0 
=C2=A0
Vasistha spoke the Yoga Vasistham, which is a pinnacle of advai=
tha princples, and Ramayana speaks of different yagyas performed by him and=
 Vishwamitra.=C2=A0 Does it mean they did not "believe" in advaita? 
=C2=A0=

Your above statement stems from an incorrect understanding of what is Adva=
itha Vada. As long as one is trapped in duality, merely saying that I belie=
ve in Advaitha Vada does not make one become so. I can keep believing that =
I am Bill Gates, but that=C2=A0won't make me Bill Gates. Rather=C2=A0I shal=
l remain merely as a self deluded entity. Untill one actually experiences t=
he state of non-duality, theoritical talk of "All- is Brahman" is self-delu=
sion. 
=C2=A0
Adwaith is a state to be achieve. It needs sustained and seri=
ous sadhana. No wonder the Rishis of yore, who were all self-realized being=
s - and had experienced the state of=C2=A0Advaitha - used to perform such l=
ong penances, including elaborate fire rituals on a daily basis. 
=C2=A0
=
=C2=A0
It is not a question of whether it is more elaborate or less elabora=
te or which is inferior or which is superior. It is a question of whether i=
t is correct and based on what vedic authority.
=C2=A0
The question is not =
about being based on "which vedic authority" BUT, is the sadhana bearing fr=
uits? Is it transforming the individual? Irrespective of which vedic 'autho=
rity' says what, if a said sadhana is not leading to experiantial knowledge=
 and states, it is useless for a genuine sadhaka. Therefore, the only way t=
o judge is to perform the sadhana and experience for oneself! And this is w=
hy there are so many who are already doing the homas on a daily basis. Some=
 have experienced paritally, some are yet to. And each experience merely ri=
vets one's mind to the sadhana more and more thus plunging in deeper and de=
eper. A sadhaka has little use for dry theory. That which cannot be experie=
nced, is of no consequence. It is this perspective that any sadhana, not ju=
st the ones mentioned by Narasimha, has to be judged by a genuine sadhaka. =

=C2=A0

2. "What I teach is ONE procedure for those who do not know any."
=
=C2=A0
Are there different ways you teach a person to fly an aeroplane depe=
nding on what he knows and what he does ?
=C2=A0
The flying of the aeroplan=
e is the same. The way one can learn is different based on the different mo=
dels of the aeroplanes in which one learns to fly!
=C2=A0
3. "Knowledge of =
*external rituals* is relative and can never be absolute. It evolves based =
on desa-kaala-paatra. There is nothing impure or corrupt about it."
=C2=A0
=
Rituals do evolve around desa and kaala but if it starts evolving around pa=
atra it is a dangerous trend.
=C2=A0
Paatra is a product of the desa and ka=
ala, not uninfluenced by the other two. That is why these three are used in=
 tandem. 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
4. "The only knowledge that should (and can) be pre=
served without corruption is knowledge that is *absolute*. Veda, or the kno=
wledge of imperishable Self, alone is absolute knowledge. Knowledge of *ext=
ernal rituals* is relative and can never be absolute".
=C2=A0
Sir, honestly=
, have you ever read the vedas to know what is inside them ? or for that ma=
tter the Sayana bhashya. other than in the ritualistic context. I am quotin=
g the above mantras because they are commonly known.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
This is =
the precisely the reason why maybe a Vivekananda had clearly stated that th=
e available interpretations of the Vedas do not do justice to it's essence.=
 Selective words from here and there really do not prove that the Vedas are=
 merely a set of rituals! This kind of an intepretation leads to a fallacy =
where-in one celebrated western commentator on the Vedas believes that the =
Purusha shukta in an example of human-scarfice practised in the Vedas. I am=
 sure you will disagree with this. 
=C2=A0
Can you kindly enlighten us, why=
 is Usha accorded an elevated status? Usha is merely a dawn. What is so big=
 deal about an average dawn, so much so that one needs to address hymns to =
it? Or for that matter other pantheon of Vedic deities from the Rig Vedas, =
which to the cursory reader, gives an impression of mere nature worshipping=
 pagan's attempting elevated poetry? And if the average word by by word tra=
nslations or a core ritualistic view=C2=A0is all there is to the Vedas, pra=
y enlighten, why is there is a gap in the philosophical structure between t=
he so called pre-historic vedic hymns vs that of the Upanishadic period? An=
d all the Upanishads seems to claim all philosphical authority from the Ved=
as itself? How can this gap in the understanding of the two contexts be bri=
dged, unless one takes an allegorical view of the recordings of=C2=A0 the V=
edas, just like in the case of pre classical Greek orphic-myths and their l=
ater day derivatives?
=C2=A0
=C2=A0

Any path, vedic, agamic, yogic, tantri=

=C2=A0

No. Many self-realized people have 'mixed' these artifically created bounda=

Dear N=
arasimhaji,
=C2=A0
Thanks for your reply.
=C2=A0
1. "There are many standar=
d homam procedures in the world today, some more elaborate than what we tea=
ch and some more brief. " - 
=C2=A0
Please clarify whether the homa procedu=
re taught by you belongs to the vedic system. If so, which authoritative te=
xt have you relied upon? Or is it one designed by yourself keeping the conv=
enience factor in mind ?
=C2=A0
There are many procedures even within the v=
edic system for performing homam. Each established procedure given by achar=
yas=C2=A0 is complete=C2=A0in itself and do not violate the fundamental pri=
nciples of vedic rituals.
=C2=A0
It will be interesting here to point out t=

. It is as per sastra. Now if you modify this and say that homa can be perf=
romed on the right glove worn by a brahmin, then the problem arises.
=C2=A0=

As you have said, any system of worship is acceptable. There are so many r=

=C2=A0

It is not a question of whether it is more elabora=

ction. On the contrary, if you need the sanction of vedic authority for it,=
 please=C2=A0answer within the ambit of vedic knowledge=C2=A0if doubts are =
raised.
=C2=A0
The apprehension is that in the year 2000 you said,
=C2=A0
"=
I cannot possibly finish this preface without expressing my deep gratitude =
for my 
guru Pt. Sanjay Rath, who has been a constant source of enlightenme=
nt, 
encouragement and inspiration. I am eternally grateful to him"
=C2=A0
=
and now you say
=C2=A0
"In my well-considered view, Sanjay ji got some spec=
ific secrets and some generic guidelines (which may be imperfect, like with=
 all other paramparas) from his elders. He then read some books and formed =
his understanding. As he started teaching it, he received a lot of adulatio=
n for the "parampara secrets". I am afraid he got addicted to the adulation=
 and started to manufacture "parampara secrets" after the initial run. Slow=
ly he became commercial and he started selling manufactured "parampara know=
ledge".
=C2=A0
Yes, his teachings contain fascinating philosophization, whi=
ch is really superficial and does not stand any real scrutiny. His theories=
 are like beautiful structures built with a pack of cards. Sanjay ji always=
 maintains an air of "I know more, but will teach later". It is convenient =
to give the impression that there is more. If anything does not make sense,=
 it could be because you have to learn more!
=C2=A0
As he started exploitin=
g and commercializing half-baked and ill-conceived knowledge in the name of=
 a parampara, I took an exception to the commercialization and dishonesty. =
After expressing my reservations privately and having no effect, I started =
to go public, first subtly and later bluntly. After several clashes, I was =
kicked out of SJC.
=C2=A0
With basic concepts like houses, arudha padas, ch=
ara karakas, argalas etc, the generic guidelines he received are imperfect.=
 He deviates from Parasara in several matters and his teachings do not work=
 consistently.
=C2=A0
Bottomline: Sanjay ji's base is made of some specific=
 secrets (that are imperfect) and some generic guidelines (that are imperfe=

=C2=A0

"Narayana dasa is a very important rasi dasa. It is a phalita dasa. It=

Narayana dasa =
is based on the progression of lagna in one=E2=80=99s life. As one dasa end=

Namaste,

Thanks for your views. There are many standa=

ach and some more brief. I do not care exactly what procedure one uses and =
I will be happy if more and more people do homam *regularly*, irrespective =

The only knowledge that should (and can) be preserved without corruption =
is knowledge that is *absolute*. Veda, or the knowledge of imperishable Sel=
f, alone is absolute knowledge.

Knowledge of *external rituals* is relativ=
e and can never be absolute. It evolves based on desa-kaala-paatra. There i=
s nothing impure or corrupt about it.

At the end of the day, the key is wh=
ether one is actually doing some sadhana on a regular basis or not, whether=
 it is causing internal transformation in one or not, and whether it helps =
in one's spiritual progress or not.

Let me cut & paste a section fr=
om a writeup I wrote for an upcoming occasion. It contains an analogy given=
 earlier and addresses some relevant issues.

Do Vedas Describe External Rituals

Some people believe that Veda descri=
bes the specifics about various external yagyas. Veda is supposed to be abs=
olute, timeless and uncreated knowledge that is not bound by desa-kaala-paa=
tra. How can descriptions of specific external rituals be unbound by desa-k=
aala-paatra?

Though Sayanacharya=E2=80=99s celebrated commentary on RigVed=
a is ritualistic in nature, Aurobindo Ghose had a different take in his =E2=
=80=9CSecret of the Veda=E2=80=9D. His view is that Veda talks about absolu=
te truths about the inner self and not relative truths about external matte=
rs. Agni or Fire symbolizes the divine Will. That is why it is the immortal=
 in mortals. Its rhythm will devour everything that is perishable and purif=
y all. While fire in a fire ritual symbolizes the divine Will, various offe=
rings in it symbolize various aspects of one=E2=80=99s conditioning and the=
 smoke symbolizes one=E2=80=99s passions and desires.

Metaphor: Vedic Homa=
m vs Aagamic Homam

Notions that so and so yagya ritual is sanctioned by Ve=
da and so and so aagamic/tantric yagya ritual is not sanctioned by Veda can=
 be put in perspective using a metaphor.

Once there were many people who l=
ived near the sea [Aatman]. They regularly sat by the sea and enjoyed the s=
ight and sound of the sea [absorbed in Aatman most of the time]. They descr=
ibed the sea in some nice cryptic poems [Veda].

As people started living a=
 little away from the sea [less spiritually evolved], someone had to put to=
gether some instructions on how to reach the sea. He said, "keep walking to=
wards east" and the instructions grew with time. People faithfully followed=
 the instructions [rituals].

People started moving further and further inl=
and and started living in a landlocked desert far away from the sea. This g=
eneration had never seen a pool of water like a lake, let alone a sea. They=
 faithfully performed the ritual of walking towards east, but did not find =
sea. They debated endlessly whether one had to walk one mile or two miles o=
r three miles and formed different schools of thought. Some walked their ch=
osen distance, found a tree or a building or some interesting object and ev=
en became satisfied that that was sea!

Then came some great person, whose =
instincts led him to take a horse instead of walking and ride it for a long=
 distance [use of other tools]. He did find the sea after a few months. He =
put together newer instructions to reach the sea, which included riding a h=
orse [new =C3=A4gama and tantra].

People performing the old rituals object=
ed to this and said "but then this horse thing is not granted by the book o=
f sea. This is a new path and different from the "pure" sea ritual" [pure V=
edic ritual]. By now, people did not even understand what the cryptic poems=
 of the original "book of sea" mean, but they simply believed that those po=
ems taught the old "pure" sea rituals that they were used to. They were bli=
ssfully unaware that the original instructions were meant for someone alrea=
dy close to sea and the newer instructions came from someone who actually s=
aw the sea and knew where they currently lived and how to get to the sea fr=
om there!

Slowly many new sets of instructions involving horses, chariots =
etc were taught and many new paths to the sea were outlined instead of just=
 instructing people to walk towards east [evolution of mantra/tantra/ yantr=
as].

One particular path through jungles was dangerous [aghora and other d=
ark tantric paths involving practice of sex, meat, wine etc]. Though the di=
stance to sea was much shorter through that jungle, it was just too dangero=
us and only the bravest and strongest could make it. There were cruel dacoi=
ts and wild animals [chance of a fall in a risky ritual] and many weak peop=
le travelling to sea via that path were killed. A wise man who knew the ent=
ire territory well came forward, condemned that path and discouraged people=
 from trying that path. Since then, even people who were strong enough to s=
uccessfully make it in that path desisted from it.

As time progressed, peo=
ple started fighting too much about whose path was superior. They were fool=
ish, not smart enough to adopt the original instructions, of either the so-=
called "pure" sea path or the so-called "new" path or other variations, for=
 the changed geography and changed times. Many followed the instructions bl=
indly, hit roadblocks and did not reach sea. Many did not even know that "r=
eaching the sea" was the actual goal of all their joirneys. They only thoug=
ht they were supposed to follow the instructions faithfully and there was n=
o need to adopt to the changed geographical territory and time. They even c=
ondemned those who actually went to sea, came back and gave updated directi=
ons for their place and time, for violating tradition.

In case the analogy=
 is not clear, here is a brief summary of its points. Veda is about realizi=
ng self. Vedic deities such as Agni, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Aswins, Brihaspa=
ti etc are slightly different aspects of Aatman. Veda describes various asp=
ects of the state of self-realization. That is why it is considered the hig=
hest knowledge. Other allied subjects throw some light on possible ways to =
reach that state. While definitive and absolute statements can be made on t=
he actual state of self-realization itself, no definitive statements can be=
 made on how to reach it. Only relative statements can be made based on des=
a-kaala-paatra. The path depends on one's current position!

Great men in m=
any spiritual paths, within Hinduism as well as outside of it, came, experi=
enced that state, understood the current state of people around them and ga=
ve specific instructions on how to reach that state from the current state.=
 Some followed the instructions and experienced the state. Some instead kep=
t arguing about the contradictions between paths.

Stop Arguing and Do Sadh=
ana

As the metaphor above illustrates, arguments about various paths are i=
rrelevant and distracting. What is important is to pick a path and follow i=
t. Whether one does a Vedic homam or an Aagamic homam is a secondary issue.=
 The primary issues are whether one does homam or not, how focused one is, =
how one=E2=80=99s focus is improving and how one is being transformed inter=
nally.

Just as a twenty course meal eaten once every six months does not g=
ive much energy to one, a =E2=80=9Cbig=E2=80=9D homam or another ritual don=
e once every six months or a year does not boost one=E2=80=99s spiritual or=
 material pursuits. Just as a small bowl of rice and lentil soup eaten ever=
yday gives more energy to one, a small 20-30 minute homam done everyday giv=
es a boost to one=E2=80=99s spiritual evolution.

Wise Tradeoffs

Suppose t=
he president of the country is visiting one for lunch with 100 associates. =
One can invite all the 100 associates of the President by name and seat the=
m in the room individually, following various protocols. Then one can excha=
nge long pleasantries with the President and then offer lunch.

Suppose one=
 is in a hurry and has very little time. If one still invites all the 100 a=
ssociates by name and seats them in the room individually following the pro=
tocol and does not have enough time to let the President eat lunch in the e=
nd, is it a wise tradeoff? Or is it wiser to invite all the 100 associates =
together and seat them together by violating the protocol and use that time=
 to let the President eat in peace?

Similarly, is it wise if one exchanges=
 long pleasantries and gives very little time to eat? Or should one cut sho=
rt on the pleasantries and give more time to eat?

In a fire ritual, making=
 offerings to the main deity is the primary part. Various upacharas done to=
 the deity before the offerings commence is secondary. Various preliminary =
and final steps and offerings to associate deities are tertiary. If one has=
 a few hours for the fire ritual, one can do everything given in scriptures=
 leisurely. If one has only 20-30 minutes, one needs to make wise tradeoffs=
 and maximize the benefit. It is far better than doing nothing.

<sections =
deleted>

Proof of the Pudding

At this time, more than hundred people are =
doing a homam to some deity or the other, everyday. Spending time worshippi=
ng god in fire for 20-30 min (or more) everyday, with an attitude of surren=
der and with some basic intellectual understanding of the absolute truths e=
xpounded by Veda and Upanishads, can do a world of good to one=E2=80=99s sp=
iritual evolution. The proof of the pudding is in eating it. One can try to=
 perform a short homam everyday for a few months and see for oneself if the=
re is a difference in one=E2=80=99s attitude, focus and clarity of thinking=
.

danam, brahma yajnam, samidadhanam (the homa performed in the morning and e=
vening by the student). It involves santha, anusantha and avrutis. The sadh=
ana continues until brahma (mantra) becomes his power (varchas) and thereaf=
ter for the rest of the life time. I have come across a scholar whose finge=
rs keep moving even in sleep in accordance with the rythm of the mantra. He=
 has transformed himself into the mantra. The veda is installed inside him.=
 This is no less than any sadhana we are speaking about.</DIV>
<DIV> <=

<DIV>=
<EM></EM> </DIV>
<DIV>What exactly is the "fundamental principles" of =
a vedic ritual? In my little understanding, it is the goal which =
is God-realization, which is the only "fundamental principle=
". Anything else is dispensable and therefore not eternal. Vedas, as all se=

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV><EM>It will be interesting here to point out t=
hat when some sections of samavedis when they perform sraadham do the&=

of the brahmin. It is believed that agni is ever present in the right hand =
of the srotriya (one learned in the veda) brahmin. There is no defect here.=
 It is as per sastra. Now if you modify this and say that homa can be perfr=
omed on the right glove worn by a brahmin, then the problem arises.</EM></D=
IV>
<DIV><EM></EM> </DIV>
<DIV>Thank you for the interesting example a=
bove. But I have a very pertinent question regarding this.  And what e=
xactly does it mean by saying one learned in the Vedas? Can one, who h=
as mugged up the Vedas and a few commentaries of the same, without experien=
cing any sort of self-realization, be called a "srotriya"? Does such a non-=
realized being have "fire" in his right hand? Never! </DIV>
<DIV> </DI=
V>
<DIV>A real "srotriya" is one who has <EM>realized </EM>the Aatman, not =
in words, but in the states of samadhi. Such a being "may have" spiritual a=
bilities of fire in his "palm". Anyone else, irrespective of whether he is&=
nbsp;born in brhamin family, is merely following a blind tradition wit=
hout having experienced anything and thus violating the essence of the Veda=
s and merely sticking to external rules which have no spiritual consequence=
. What use is such a 'vedic' rituals, if at all they can be calle=
d as vedic. That which is devoide of the essence, is an empty shell which i=
s bound to reform or perish in the course of time. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>=

<DIV>Therefore, for me, it hardly matters if the ritual is done on the bar=
e palms or a gloved hands of a person who has never experienced the Self. B=
oth, are in clear violation of the Vedic essence.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<=
DIV><EM>Homam is a ritualistic form of worship and if you bring in advaita =
vada in it it doesn't work.</EM></DIV>
<DIV><EM></EM> </DIV>
<DIV>This=
 is definitely incorrect! The vedic rishis were famous for doing elaborate =
yagyas and homas. By extension of your above logic, it means they did not b=
elieve in Advaita since they used to engage themselves in homas and yagyas?=
  </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Vasistha spoke the Yoga Vasistham, whi=
ch is a pinnacle of advaitha princples, and Ramayana speaks of different ya=
gyas performed by him and Vishwamitra.  Does it mean they did not "bel=
ieve" in advaita? </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Your above statement stems =
from an incorrect understanding of what is Advaitha Vada. As long as one is=
 trapped in duality, merely saying that I believe in Advaitha Vada does not=
 make one become so. I can keep believing that I am Bill Gates, but that&nb=
sp;won't make me Bill Gates. Rather I shall remain merely as a self de=
luded entity. Untill one actually experiences the state of non-duality, the=
oritical talk of "All- is Brahman" is self-delusion. </DIV>
<DIV> </DI=
V>
<DIV>Adwaith is a state to be achieve. It needs sustained and serious sa=
dhana. No wonder the Rishis of yore, who were all self-realized beings - an=
d had experienced the state of Advaitha - used to perform such long pe=
nances, including elaborate fire rituals on a daily basis. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbs=
p;</DIV>
<DIV><EM></EM> </DIV>
<DIV><EM>It is not a question of whethe=

uperior. It is a question of whether it is correct and based on what vedic =
authority.</EM></DIV>
<DIV><EM></EM> </DIV>
<DIV>The question is not a=
bout being based on "which vedic authority" BUT, is the sadhana bearing fru=
its? Is it transforming the individual? Irrespective of which vedic 'author=
ity' says what, if a said sadhana is not leading to experiantial knowledge =
and states, it is useless for a genuine sadhaka. Therefore, the only way to=
 judge is to perform the sadhana and experience for oneself! And this is wh=
y there are so many who are already doing the homas on a daily basis. Some =
have experienced paritally, some are yet to. And each experience merely riv=
ets one's mind to the sadhana more and more thus plunging in deeper and dee=
per. A sadhaka has little use for dry theory. That which cannot be experien=
ced, is of no consequence. It is this perspective that any sadhana, not jus=
t the ones mentioned by Narasimha, has to be judged by a genuine sadhaka. <=

 from here and there really do not prove that the Vedas are merely a set of=
 rituals! This kind of an intepretation leads to a fallacy where-in one cel=

isagree with this. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Can you kindly enlighten u=
s, why is Usha accorded an elevated status? Usha is merely a dawn. What is =
so big deal about an average dawn, so much so that one needs to address hym=
ns to it? Or for that matter other pantheon of Vedic deities from the Rig V=
edas, which to the cursory reader, gives an impression of mere nature worsh=
ipping pagan's attempting elevated poetry? And if the average word by by wo=
rd translations or a core ritualistic view is all there is to the Veda=
s, pray enlighten, why is there is a gap in the philosophical structure bet=
ween the so called pre-historic vedic hymns vs that of the Upanishadic peri=
od? And all the Upanishads seems to claim all philosphical authority from t=
he Vedas itself? How can this gap in the understanding of the two contexts =
be bridged, unless one takes an allegorical view of the recordings of =
 the Vedas, just like in the case of pre classical Greek orphic-myths and t=

<DIV>Dear Narasimhaji,</DIV>
<DIV>&nb=
sp;</DIV>
<DIV>Thanks for your reply.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>1. "Ther=
e are many standard homam procedures in the world today, some more elaborat=
e than what we teach and some more brief. " - </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV=
>Please clarify whether the homa procedure taught by you belongs to the ved=
ic system. If so, which authoritative text have you relied upon? Or is it o=
ne designed by yourself keeping the convenience factor in mind ?</DIV>
<DIV=
> </DIV>
<DIV>There are many procedures even within the vedic system f=
or performing homam. Each established procedure given by acharyas  is =
complete in itself and do not violate the fundamental principles of ve=
dic rituals.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>It will be interesting here to po=
int out that when some sections of samavedis when they perform sraadham&nbs=
p;do the hormam on the palm of the bhokta brahmin. It is called paniho=
mam. Even the fire is not present there. It is based on a dictum called " b=
rahmanasya dakshine haste hotavyam" - the homa is to be performed on the ri=
ght hand of the brahmin. It is believed that agni is ever present in the ri=
ght hand of the srotriya (one learned in the veda) brahmin. There is no def=
ect here. It is as per sastra. Now if you modify this and say that homa can=
 be perfromed on the right glove worn by a brahmin, then the problem arises=
.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>As you have said, any system of worship is a=
cceptable. There are so many religions and cults all around the world. Nobo=
dy objects. If you call something vedic, please make sure that it conforms =
to the vedic tenets.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Homam is a ritualistic fo=
rm of worship and if you bring in advaita vada in it it doesn't work.</DIV>=

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>It is not a question of whether it is more elaborat=
e or less elaborate or which is inferior or which is superior. It is a ques=
tion of whether it is correct and based on what vedic authority. If you are=
 promoting this homa procedure as one of your own design, there is no objec=
tion. On the contrary, if you need the sanction of vedic authority for it, =
please answer within the ambit of vedic knowledge if doubts are r=
aised.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>The apprehension is that in the year 20=
00 you said,</DIV>

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>and now you say</DIV>
<DIV>&=
nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>"In my well-considered view, Sanjay ji got some specific s=
ecrets and some generic guidelines (which may be imperfect, like with all o=
ther paramparas) from his elders. He then read some books and formed his un=
derstanding. As he started teaching it, he received a lot of adulation for =
the "parampara secrets". I am afraid he got addicted to the adulation and s=
tarted to manufacture "parampara secrets" after the initial run. Slowly he =
became commercial and he started selling manufactured "parampara knowledge"=
.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Yes, his teachings contain fascinating philo=
sophization, which is really superficial and does not stand any real scruti=
ny. His theories are like beautiful structures built with a pack of cards. =
Sanjay ji always maintains an air of "I know more, but will teach later". I=
t is convenient to give the impression that there is more. If anything does=
 not make sense, it could be because you have to learn more!</DIV>
<DIV>&nb=
sp;</DIV>
<DIV>As he started exploiting and commercializing half-baked and =
ill-conceived knowledge in the name of a parampara, I took an exception to =
the commercialization and dishonesty. After expressing my reservations priv=
ately and having no effect, I started to go public, first subtly and later =
bluntly. After several clashes, I was kicked out of SJC.</DIV>
<DIV> <=
/DIV>
<DIV>With basic concepts like houses, arudha padas, chara karakas, ar=
galas etc, the generic guidelines he received are imperfect. He deviates fr=
om Parasara in several matters and his teachings do not work consistently.<=
/DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Bottomline: Sanjay ji's base is made of some s=
pecific secrets (that are imperfect) and some generic guidelines (that are =
imperfect too). Starting from that base and reading books, he hastily creat=
ed a body of knowledge which he sells now. If there is anything in his teac=
