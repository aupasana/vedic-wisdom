Namaste,
 
Yes, Narayana kavacham is not just for physical protection from external problems, but also subtle protection from internal problems.
 
Moreover, spiritual progress requires some physical and material well-being. An unhealthy body may not be able to focus on god. One with an empty stomach may not be able to focus on god.
 
Of course, the *final* goal of spiritual sadhana is to be able to focus on god even when one is unhealthy and in material troubles. But, until one makes sufficient progress, one will be troubled by physical and material problems. Pretending that one is not troubled does not solve the problem or improve one's self-control. One should do enough to take care of physical and material well-being, even to do sadhana and make spiritual progress.
 
Detachment and rejectiona are different. Trying for something while being prepared for not getting it is detached action. Running away from something is rejection. Trying for something and getting so disappointed when one does not get it that one wastes a lot of time and energy worrying about it is attached action. Detached action is what enables one to make further spiritual progress.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

I was amazed to read that In the verses we request Narayana's incarnations to protect us from enemies. And these enemies include both our external enemies and our internal enemies like anger, ignorance, laziness, lust etc.

Burning homam fire is meant for stimulating and making the inner light shine brighter. So, normally, homam is performed during the daytime. When Sun is just rising and destroying darkness is a great time for homam.
