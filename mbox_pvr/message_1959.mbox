Dear Vijay,

> and hence Kali=Krishna is not a fully correct argument.

You did not read properly.

Saying Krishna=Kaali or equating of Vishnu's dasavataras with dasa 
mahavidyas is not my deduction, but directly from Munda Maalaa Tantra. The 
word used is "sakshaat".

If it makes no sense to you, it means you have not tried hard enough to 
understand.

Ramakrishna Paramahamsa also compared Krishna and Kaali specifically and 
said they were essentially the same. Just as Sun and Sun's light may seem 
different to some people and yet are the same in essence, he said Krishna 
and Kaali are the same.

Mahavidyas are for the purpose of guidance towards moksha and Vishnu's 
avataras are for the purpose of establishing dharma on earth. Accordingly, 
mahavidyas and avataras that have been equated will have minor difference in 
manifestation in our eyes. But scriptures have a basis for equating them. I 
will write more on this later.

For now, I wanted to challenge the planet-mahavidya map people have been 
using, which is based on piecemeal kind of explanations based on superficial 
factors of symbols and extraneous details, without a uniform philosophical 
basis and without scriptural basis either.

Best regards,
Narasimha
