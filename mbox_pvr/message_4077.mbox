Namaste Chandan Singh ji,
 
Gayatri is not a vritta chhandas. It is a highly flexible metre. There is no requirement on each syllable to be short/long. But Bhujanga prayaata is a vritta, i.e. the exact sequence of short and long syllables is fixed. So it has a fixed rhythm.
 
The rule for Bhujanga Prayaata metre is:
 
"bhujaMga prayaataM chaturbhir yakaaraiH"
 
It means "Bhujanga Prayaata is with 4 ya's". Ya group is formed with one laghu, one guru and one guru (i.e. short-long-long), in that order. For example, "nirIsham" has 3 syllables ("ni-rI-shaM") and fits the pattern of short-long-long. You put 4 such ya-groups together and you get one line of Bhujanga Prayaata. There are 4 such lines.
 
Bhujanga Prayaata literally means "going of a snake". The pattern "lalAlA-lalAlA-lalAlA-lalAlA" has a movement kind of similar to the curvy movement of a snake. That may be why it is named thus.
 
However, at a subtler level, please note that different sound patterns create different awareness in the consciousness when it focuses on the sound pattern and loses track of everything else (other than that sound). When mind is filled with 100s and 1000s of thoughts, one does not experience a mantra or its deity. To let the mantra and its deity occupy the mind, one needs to create a vacuum for them in the mind. When other thoughts cease in the mind and mind reverberates with a mantra alone, that is when mantra and its deity "fill" the mind and one "experiences" them. What the sound pattern of a Bhujanga Prayaata metre does to the consciousness when it succeeds in a perfect focus can be guessed from the name - movement of which symbolic snake?

Today is Pournima and the day of my monthly Satya Narayana vratam. Satya Narayana is Truth personified, starting from low level truths till the highest Truth that all is God. Today is an auspicious day for worshipping the god of Truth. Let me compose a small verse in this beautiful chhandas on my Lord. I am typing it in iTrans notation.
 
mahAntaM hariM satyaloke vasantaM |
sadA cidvirUpaM madApannivAraM |
asachChedakaM bhedakhedaapahaaraM |
guruM pratyayaM satyadevaM bhaje.ahaM ||
 
Translation: To Him, who is supreme, Hari, who resides in Satya Loka, who is always the underlying reality as well as the variegated forms, who impedes my troubles, who cuts asunder untruth, who takes away the distress of duality, who is magnificent, who is rooted in firm and deep faith, I offer worship to that Lord Satya Deva (Truth personified).
 
*        *        *
 
I am sorry about Yousuf's death and hope his soul finds peace in its onward journey.
 
Instead of politicizing somebody's death ("A dying man tried his level best to say something in the last few days, yet none understood him"), let us just wish him peace and leave it at that.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

There is a very interesting story about this stotra. Adi Shankara reached his mother's death bed before she died. He wanted to help her get salvation. So he composed a great stotra called Shiva Bhujanga Prayata Stotra in praise of Lord Shiva. As soon as it was completed, The servants of Lord Shiva came to take Shankara's mother to heaven. But she was terrified to see them, because they wore the dresses of the forest and dressed in tiger skin with belts of snakes. Understanding her problem, Shankara humbly requested the servants of Lord Shiva to go back and composed this prayer to Lord Vishnu in the Bhujanga prayata meter. Once he recited it, the servants of Lord Vishnu, who had polished God like looks came to accompany Shankara's mother to heaven. She was extremely pleased to go with them.]
