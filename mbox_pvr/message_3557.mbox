Dear Arunisha,

Let me clarify my thinking.

In my view, there is no need f=
or a conversion ceremony. However, if a ceremony makes one feel good, I am =
not against it.

If someone who has been reading scriptures and trying to f=
ollow Sanatana dharma for 15 years and doing a mantra 1008 times everyday (=
like Joseph said below) asks me what ceremony he should do to "convert", I =
will tell him "you are already a Hindu, i.e. adherent of Sanatana dharma, a=
nd a good one at that. There is no need to do any ceremony." Even if his na=
me is Joseph and not a Sanskrit name, it does not change anything.

However=
, if the same person has already decided to do some ceremony and tells me t=
hat he is doing so and so ceremony to convert, I will only wish him good lu=
ck and not admonish him for doing those ceremonies.

Bottomline is that sha=
stras do not teach any procedures for "converting" someone into Hinduism. A=
fter all, the question of "conversion" does not arise in "vasudhaiva kutumb=
akam" philosophy that says that the whole world is one family! However, som=
e priests may come up with some procedures. Let them do so. Why should we s=
top them? We do so many things in life that are not really needed. What is =
the harm in a nice ceremony where a Sanskrit name is formally given and var=
ious childhood, teenage and adult samskaras are done to an adult symbolical=
ly?

*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

If anybody is thinking of "converting" non-Hindus to =
sanatana dharma or converting passive Hindus into active Hindus or better H=
indus, I can suggest a simple approach. Give a Vaidik/Pouranik mantra (any)=
 to the person, ask him/her to chant it everyday and give a nice spiritual =
book to read. When you find a suitable person, you can also give a sacred t=
hread, teach Mahaganapathi homam and ask the person to do it every day or w=
eek.

*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

Please remember one important thing. Supose there is =
a good Christian or Muslim or Zoroastrian or Buddhist who is dedicated to o=
ne's religion, who is calm at heart, who sees the whole world as a sacred c=
reation of an almighty god (whatever the name may be), who sees all beings =
as embodiments of god and deals with them with love and respect, who is ver=
y thoughtful and responsible in deciding his own actions and very considera=
te and forgiving in responding to other people's actions. Such a person is =
dhaarmik and a good follower of sanatana dharma despite the name of the rel=
igion he follows and the name of the god he worships. There is no need to "=
convert" such a person.

If someone is not as described above and has bad q=
ualities, one can try to convert such a person into one who follows dharma =
better by either introducing him to the teachings of rishis and well-known =
practices of "Hinduism" OR simply by directing him to the true meaning of t=
he teachings of the messiahs in his own *formal* religion.

Best regards,
N=
arasimha

Namaste,

Well, our =
shastras do not define a religion called "Hinduism". Our shastras define sa=
natana dharma - the perennial path of righteous duty. Sanatana dharma is no=
t an exclusive property of people born to "Hindu" parents. Sanatana dharma =
belongs to the entire world and encompasses every human being whether or no=
t one realizes it!

Some people who consider themselves Hindus may or may n=
ot be following dharma well.

There may not be much difference between some=
body from another religion with a strong interest in "Hinduism" and somebod=
y born to Hindu parents but having either passive interest or disinterest i=
n Sanatana dharma and teachings of rishis. In fact, the former may be a bet=
ter adherent of Sanatana dharma than the latter in some cases! If there is =
no need to convert the latter to "Hinduism", there is no need to convert th=
e former
 either!

Several ceremonies like naamakarana samskaara (naming) a=
re more social customs than dharmik matters.

In my opinion, if a person is=
 given a Vedic or Pouraanik mantra (any) by a decent guru and asked to chan=
t it everyday for an amount of time, and if he/she is exposed to some scrip=
ture (e.g. Gita, Upanishads etc) and asked to read it, understand it and le=
t it affect one's thinking, I think one is then a Hindu, i.e. one will soon=
 find oneself adhering to Sanatana dharma. There is no need for any ceremon=
ies.

*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

In fact, now there are some "foreigners" who perform =
a homam every weekend, to Ganapathi, Krishna etc. If anybody thinks they ar=
e not "Hindus", one is not thinking straight. They are more Hindus than man=
y Hindus in India who have forgotten their dharma.

A braahmana's dharma is=
 to pursue spiritual progress and engage the
 mind in the god for the benef=
it of the world. One who does not spend time in japam or homam for the bene=
fit of the world is not a braahmana. If a foreigner is passionately interes=
ted in spiritual progress and does japam or homam every day or week for the=
 benefit of the world and one's own spiritual upliftment, such a foreigner =
is not only a Hindu, but also a braahmana.

Narasimha

 not spend time in japam or homam for the benefit of the world is not a bra=

's own spiritual upliftment, such a foreigner is not only a Hindu, but also=
 a braahmana.<br><br>Best regards,<br>Narasimha<br>------------ --------- -=
