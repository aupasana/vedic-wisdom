Dear Lakshmi,
 
The Yogananda I mentioned is different. Swami Yogananda is =
one of the sixteen monastic disciples of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, along wit=
h Swami Vivekananda. He was forced to marry, but never slept with his own w=
ife. Swami Vivekananda once said "if any of us (disciples of Ramakrishna) c=
onquered lust completely and in all respects, it is Joginder (Swami Yoganan=
da)". There is no question of Swami Yogananda being accused of drinking and=
 having women etc.
 
Paramahamsa Yogananda is a sishya of Yukteshwar Mahara=
j and from the lineage of Mahavatar Babaji. They practice kriya yoga. I do =
not know much about him.
 
*         *         *
 
The link you gave is abo=
ut neither Swami Yogananda nor Paramahamsa Yogananda, but some propaganda a=
bout Ramakrishna Paramahamsa himself, based on some bali he apparently gave=
. So I am unsure exactly who you wanted to talk about..
 
Best regards,
Nar=
asimha

    Namaste,

    I meant it figurative=

    For the reference on Yogananda, you can read the section on Swami =
Yogananda in "God Lived with Them: Life Stories of Sixteen Monastic Discipl=
es of Sri Ramakrishna" by Swami Chetanananda.

    *        *        *

   =
 There have been many great yogis, babas, saints and swamis in the last few=
 thousand years of Kali yuga. But Ramakrishna Paramahamsa stands out in one=
 way. He is one master who mastered every single path. He mastered bhakti y=
oga, jnaana yoga, karma yoga and even raaja yoga. He worshipped and experie=
nced Rama, Krishna, Kaali and several forms. He even reached the state of n=
irvikalpa samadhi, where there is no "experience". He was in sahaja samadhi=
 always. He was able induce tremendous experience in people by mere touch o=
r mere look. Yet he was simple like a child and had zero ego (that is why h=
e could do all that!!!).

    Many "gurus" force their dharma on their sish=
yas and have no ability to recognize the true nature and dharma of each sis=
hya. They force sishyas to chant the mantra they chant, worship the form th=
ey worship and walk the path they walk. Ramakrishna had deep insight into t=
he true nature of each sishya and gave specific instructions. He taught tot=
ally different mantras, totally different forms and totally different paths=
 to different sishyas. He even taught contradictory things to different sis=
hyas. When one sishya who needed to mend his aggressive attitude roughed up=
 somebody for insulting his guru, he scolded "shame on you. With your attit=
ude, you did not defend your guru, but brought shame to him. You should lea=
rn to be calm and ignore such insults. THAT will place your guru in a good =
stead and not your aggression". When another sishya who needed to mend his =
soft demeanor ignored insults of Ramakrishna by some people and came away s=
ilently, he scolded him "shame on you. Shastras say that you should kill on=
e who insults your guru. How can you ignore such wrong behavior? You should=
 give them a piece of your mind."

    Spiritual sadhana does not mean just=
 chanting a mantra or repeating a procedure everyday for a certain period o=
f time. Spiritual sadhana is a continuous process by which one transforms o=
neself from inside out and purifies oneself. That way, every action and eve=
ry thought becomes a sadhana and offers an opportunity for introspection an=
d transformation of internal attitude.

    Anyway, coming back to the poin=
t, Ramakrishna is not a normal sadhaka or a normal guru. He belonged to a v=
ery special class of sadhakas and he was an exceptional guru to an exceptio=
nal group of sishyas.

    Without his [indirect] blessings, I would be a n=
obody and would be lower than dirt. I would not be able to say anything int=
elligent or meaningful in spiritual matters. Those who are impressed/inspir=
ed by something I write should be thankful to my guru Dr Manish Pandit and =
to Sri Ramakrishna for showering their grace using me as an instrument and =
not to me.

    BTW, you are all free to forward my posts that you like to =
people who may be interested in spiritual discussions. I have no problem. A=
s I said before, I am a servant distributing the wealth of a king (Mother) =
as asked by the minister (my guru).

              Namaste,

              As Vimalananda says, dharma is inde=
ed personal. Krishna clearly says in 
              Bhagavad Geeta "Follow =
your own dharma. It is dangerous to follow someone 
              else's dh=
arma".

              Following the path of dharma basically means engaging=
 in the right 
              action/duty. Right action varies from person t=
o person, from time to time 
              and from place to place. It is d=
ependent on what nature expects from you, 
              which in turn is b=
ased on who you have been in the past, what actions you 
              did =
in the past while identifying with the action, who you affected in the 
   =
           past (and how) with the actions that you identified with, what d=
ebts you 
              created in the process, and what mental tendencies =
you accumulated until 
              now.

              If, based on one's=
 mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person 
              t=
o kill evil persons, that becomes one's dharma. If, based on one's mental 
=
              tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread =
the message of 
              uniformity of all religions, that becomes one=
's dharma. If, based on one's 
              mental tendencies and karmic d=
ebts, nature wants a person to spread the 
              ritual of homam in=
 the world, that becomes one's dharma. If, based on one's 
              me=
ntal tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to make a lot of 
 =
             money and construct a temple, that becomes one's dharma.

    =
          * * *

              The dharma of a being may change from one li=
fe to another.

              At the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna=
's dharma to kill his gurus, 
              elders and relatives. The time =
then was such that there was too much weight 
              on earth and na=
ture wanted earth to be relieved of some weight. Tremendous 
              =
destruction was to take place and civilization destroyed to a great extent,=
 
              to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna being =
a great warrior, 
              it was his dharma to facilitate that. Some =
people he deeply loved and 
              respected were on the other side =
and it was his dharma to kill them.

              When the same Arjuna was=
 born again in the 19th century as one of 
              Ramakrishna Parama=
hamsa' s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a 
              previ=
ous life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different in this 
   =
           new time and place. He was born to renounce material life despit=
e his 
              aristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a =
monk and inspire 
              generations to embrace a simple life of men=
tal detachment and service to 
              others. When he is born again =
(which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna 
              said), his dharma =
based on the time and place may be something else.

              * * *

  =
            The tricky question is: How does one decide what is one's dharm=
a?

              Some people have interpreted Krishna's words saying "foll=
ow your own dharma 
              and not someone else's dharma" in the lig=
ht of castism. Though the concept 
              of caste (varna) has been =
there in Hinduism for a long time, the concept of 
              caste mobi=
lity was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by 
              =
killing birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was a=
 
              kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a brahmana and and=
 a maharshi 
              later. Basically varna shows one's aptitude. One=
 starts off with the varna 
              of father, because that is what o=
ne is exposed to in childhood. As one 
              develops in life, one =
gets one's own varna based on what one does.

              Thus, the misin=
terpretation of Krishna's words which tells you to know your 
             =
 dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas in=
 
              the world. Each person has individual dharma.

            =
  Knowing what one's dharma is is very very very difficult. If one is pure =

              enough, one will *know* one's dharma. In fact, all of us hav=
e a part of our 
              mind that tells us what our dharma is, but i=
t is surrounded by a lot of 
              noise from other parts of our mi=
nds which tell other things. Thus, we get 
              confused.

       =
       We should make the best judgment combining discrimination and intuit=
ion and 
              decide what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. W=
e may be err, but doing 
              the best we can is all that we can d=
o!

              More than following dharma, what is of utmost importance =
is to engage in 
              actions without identification. *That* alone=
 ensures that we are not 
              accumulating new karmas, i.e. not i=
ncreasing the load. We should not build 
              too much attachment =
to what we are doing. We should engage in the best 
              possible =
actions (based on our best judgment on what our dharma in the given 
      =
        situation is), with as little attachment and self-identification wi=
th the 
              action as possible. When the action is finished, we s=
hould leave the result 
              to god. We should not think "I did it=
", "what will happen now", "will it 
              work" etc. Such adherenc=
e of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through 
              untached action=
) will simplify our ego and purify our consciousness slowly. 
             =
 As we become purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma clearer=
. 
              There is a positive feedback here. This will slowly enable=
 us to see our 
              dharma clearly and follow it without incurrin=
g new karmas. This is not easy, 
              but not as difficult as peop=
le think.

              The bottomline is: Even if one is not following on=
e's dharma, one's sense of 
              "this is my dharma" gets refined =
with time if one engages in action with 
              little attachment.

=
              * * *

              In deciding one's dharma, one's intellec=
t and intuition are the inputs. 
              Another external input is th=
e words of scriptures and learned men. One can 
              derive one's =
dharma from them. A special place is given to one's spiritual 
            =
  master. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can take the words o=
f 
              the master to determine one's dharma and follow it sincere=
ly.

              When Arjuna was confused about what his dharma was and t=
hought killing gurus 
              and relatives was not dharma, he had a =
guru in Krishna who clarified his 
              dharma. When Narendranath =
(Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dharma 
              and wanted=
 to renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do sadhana, 
         =
     Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the ma=
terial 
              world and do the work of Mother for him.

           =
   One who is not in tune with nature and does not know who one is, what on=
e's 
              debts are and what nature expects from one can err in th=
e judgment of what 
              one's dharma is. If one's guru is an elev=
ated soul with a clear insight into 
              one's inner core, such a=
 guru can give perfect guidance.

              * * *

              Bottom=
line is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles and 
       =
       declare that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person=
, from 
              time to time and from place to place. Also, there are=
 no thumbrules to find 
              out what one's dharma is. But, one ca=
n refine one's understanding of one's 
              dharma by increasing i=
nternal purity. By doing various kinds of spiritual 
              sadhana =
(like homam, japam etc) and engaging in actions without much 
             =
 attachment, one can slowly purify oneself and refine one's understanding o=
f 
              one's individual dharma.

varies from 
              person to person, from time to time <BR>and from=
 place to place. 
              It is dependent on what nature expects from=
 you, <BR>which in turn 
              is based on who you have been in the=

s mental <BR>tendencies and karmic debts, nature 
              wants a per=
son to spread the message of <BR>uniformity of all

the <BR>ritual of homam in the world, that becomes one's

              of a being may change from one life to another.<BR><BR>At th=
e time

s gurus, 
              <BR>elders and relatives. The time then was such th=
at there was 
              too much weight <BR>on earth and nature wanted =
earth to be 
              relieved of some weight. Tremendous <BR>destruct=
ion was to take 
              place and civilization destroyed to a great =
extent, <BR>to welcome 
              Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Ar=
juna being a great warrior, 
              <BR>it was his dharma to facilit=
ate that. Some people he deeply

 on the other side and it was his

 one of <BR>Ramakrishna Paramahamsa' s sishyas 
              (Swami Yogana=
nda had been Arjuna in a <BR>previous life, according 
              to Ram=
akrishna) , his dharma was different in this <BR>new time 
              an=

              <=
BR>aristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and 
        =
      inspire <BR>generations to embrace a simple life of mental 
         =
     detachment and service to <BR>others. When he is born again (which 
  =
            he has to, as per what Ramakrishna <BR>said), his dharma based =
on 
              the time and place may be something else.<BR><BR>* * *<BR=
><BR>The 
              tricky question is: How does one decide what is one=
's 
              dharma?<BR><BR>Some people have interpreted Krishna's wor=
ds saying 
              "follow your own dharma <BR>and not someone else's=
 dharma" in the 
              light of castism. Though the concept <BR>of =
caste (varna) has been 
              there in Hinduism for a long time, th=
e concept of <BR>caste 
              mobility was very much there. Valmiki=
 was a shudra who lived by 
              <BR>killing birds. He became a br=
ahmana and a maharshi later. 
              Vishwamitra was a <BR>kshatrita=
 and a powerful king. He became a 
              brahmana and and a maharsh=
i <BR>later. Basically varna shows one's 
              aptitude. One start=
s off with the varna <BR>of father, because 
              that is what one=
 is exposed to in childhood. As one <BR>develops 
              in life, on=
e gets one's own varna based on what one 
              does.<BR><BR>Thus, =
the misinterpretation of Krishna's words which 
              tells you to =
know your <BR>dharma from your caste is wrong. 
              Moreover, the=
re are not just 4 dharmas in <BR>the world. Each 
              person has =
individual dharma.<BR><BR>Knowing what one's dharma is 
              is ve=
ry very very difficult. If one is pure <BR>enough, one will 
              =
*know* one's dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our 
              <=
BR>mind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by 
        =
      a lot of <BR>noise from other parts of our minds which tell other 
  =
            things. Thus, we get <BR>confused.<BR><BR>We should make the be=
st 
              judgment combining discrimination and intuition and <BR>d=
ecide 
              what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may be =
err, but 
              doing <BR>the best we can is all that we can do!<BR=
><BR>More than 
              following dharma, what is of utmost importanc=
e is to engage in 
              <BR>actions without identification. *That*=
 alone ensures that we 
              are not <BR>accumulating new karmas, =
i.e. not increasing the load. 
              We should not build <BR>too mu=
ch attachment to what we are doing. 
              We should engage in the =
best <BR>possible actions (based on our 
              best judgment on wha=
t our dharma in the given <BR>situation is), 
              with as little =
attachment and self-identification with the 
              <BR>action as po=
ssible. When the action is finished, we should 
              leave the res=
ult <BR>to god. We should not think "I did it", "what 
              will h=
appen now", "will it <BR>work" etc. Such adherence of 
              nishka=
ma karma yoga (unfication through <BR>untached action) will 
              =
simplify our ego and purify our consciousness slowly. <BR>As we 
          =
    become purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma 
         =
     clearer. <BR>There is a positive feedback here. This will slowly 
    =
          enable us to see our <BR>dharma clearly and follow it without 
  =
            incurring new karmas. This is not easy, <BR>but not as difficul=
t 
              as people think.<BR><BR>The bottomline is: Even if one is =
not 
              following one's dharma, one's sense of <BR>"this is my d=
harma" 
              gets refined with time if one engages in action with =
<BR>little 
              attachment.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>In deciding one's=
 dharma, one's 
              intellect and intuition are the inputs. <BR>A=
nother external input 
              is the words of scriptures and learned=
 men. One can <BR>derive 
              one's dharma from them. A special p=
lace is given to one's 
              spiritual <BR>master. If one surrende=
rs to a spiritual master, one 
              can take the words of <BR>the =
master to determine one's dharma and 
              follow it sincerely.<BR=
><BR>When Arjuna was confused about what 
              his dharma was and =
thought killing gurus <BR>and relatives was not 
              dharma, he h=
ad a guru in Krishna who clarified his <BR>dharma. 
              When Nare=
ndranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his 
              dharma <=
BR>and wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded 
              pla=
ce to do sadhana, <BR>Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and 
              prev=
ailed upon him to stay in the material <BR>world and do the 
              =
work of Mother for him.<BR><BR>One who is not in tune with nature 
        =
      and does not know who one is, what one's <BR>debts are and what 
    =
          nature expects from one can err in the judgment of what <BR>one's=
 
              dharma is. If one's guru is an elevated soul with a clear i=
nsight 
              into <BR>one's inner core, such a guru can give perfe=
ct 
              guidance.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Bottomline is that I (or an=
ybody) 
              cannot outline a set of principles and <BR>declare th=
at as the 
              dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person, =
from <BR>time to 
              time and from place to place. Also, there a=
re no thumbrules to 
              find <BR>out what one's dharma is. But, =
one can refine one's 
              understanding of one's <BR>dharma by in=
creasing internal purity. 
              By doing various kinds of spiritua=
l <BR>sadhana (like homam, japam 
              etc) and engaging in action=
