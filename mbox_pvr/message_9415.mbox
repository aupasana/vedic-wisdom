Namaste friends,
=C2=A0
A 2 cents on a few different points related to this=
 topic.

=C2=A0
(1) Suppose some of my children are living in a house that =
is right next to a big river and a big wall with my picture painted on it i=
s protecting the=C2=A0
house from the river water. Suppose they become stup=
id and decide to 
"move" that wall somewhere else. Suppose the house is the=
n ruined by the river.
=C2=A0
Is it that I became wrathful because a wall w=
ith "my 
picture" painted on it was moved (suggesting that I am so attached=
 to that picture)? Or is it that I loved them, but they 
were stupid enough=
 to remove their protection and paid for it?
=C2=A0
(2)
The word "dhArI" is=
 from the root "dhR", which means to hold, maintain, preserve. The word "dh=
ArI" literally means one who holds things together. Dhaari Devi stands for =
the
 protective force that holds various complex forces in a delicate 
equi=
librium. Because this temple contains the upper half of the torso 
and the =
bottom half is worshipped at another location as "Kaali", people may think =
of her as Kaali. But the goddess who was moved is the goddess of protection=
 and balance. This is a case of withdrawal of protection in a delicate equi=
librium rather than wrath, thought it may seem like the latter.
=C2=A0
(3) =
Some deities like Kaali, Bhairavi, Dhoomavati etc may indeed by associated =
with fierce destruction. However, the stereotypical image some people may h=
ave of such deities as wrathful, out-of-control, irritable persons is inacc=
urate.
=C2=A0
Everyday billions of cells in our bodies become useless. They=
 block other good cells from functioning. Body has an elaborate system to "=
kill" them, flush them out of the system and recycle the elements in them, =
i.e. create new cells. This is a natural process and one without which life=
 is will be far less pleasant/sustainable. The force behind this natural pr=
ocess is not irritable or angry. It is just something very thoughtful, wise=
 and elaborate. But, if we personify that force, its actions of killing bil=
lions of cells and flushing them out may indeed make it look like an angry =
and irritable person!
=C2=A0
Deities such as Kaali and Bhairavi are personi=
fications of the forces behind this natural process of destruction, elimina=
tion and recycling, within the "macrocosm". Remove the stereotypes from you=
r mind to gain a better understanding of these deities and genuine love for=
 them (and not fake love out of necessity and fear).
=C2=A0
(4) First of al=
l, let us accept that shifting a temple that was established specifically f=
or protecting this region was an unwise and bad karma. Yet, it is not 100% =
clear whether what happened is a direct consequence. In this case, it may v=
ery well be. But the bigger point I want to make is that we do not really k=
now which karmaphala is arising from which karma. We often draw convenient =
conclusions based on our beliefs, agendas and conditioning.
=C2=A0
For exam=
ple, when hurricane Sandy happened in northeast US, some Christian conserva=
tive commentators in US said that states that were legalizing gay marriage =
were facing the wrath of God! They probably believed it genuinely. It was p=
erhaps perfectly logical for the image of "god" constructed in their own mi=
nds to do it!! But, it may be a silly idea given the image of god construct=
ed in the mind of someone else.
=C2=A0
God is infinite and un-knowable. We =
all have an *evolving* finite image of god in our finite and conditioned mi=
nds based on our own *evolving* sense of good and bad, strong and weak, des=
irable and undesirable, etc. It is wise not to second guess god and associa=
te specific karmas with specific karmaphalas, for we can never know with ce=
rtainty.
=C2=A0
Having said that, a bad karma can be avoided whether or not=
 it caused a specific karma phala or not!
=C2=A0
(5) Though everyday billio=
ns of new cells are created in our bodies, billions of old cells are killed=
 and flushed out and trillions of cells sustained, some periods before peri=
odic rejuvenation bring more destruction than usual.
=C2=A0
I do believe th=
at the world is going through such a "Kaali phase" right now. It probably w=
ill continue for another decade or less. However, relocation of a temple is=
 very small problem compared to bigger problems that the Mother of fine bal=
ance must handle in this world right now, to come up with a more sustainabl=
e equilibrium!
=C2=A0
Human beings are arrogantly and foolishly ruining the=
ir own environment, under the delusion that it is ok. A powerful minority i=
s spreading unnatural and unsustainable lifestyles everywhere in the world,=
 under the delusion of speading "civilization" and "development". The food =
people eat, the drinks people dump in their bodies and the air people breat=
he, are increasingly polluted with dangerous chemicals.
=C2=A0
In the inter=
est of the sustenance of earth and life on it, some drastic changes MUST be=
 made. The changes kicked off by the force of Kaali will continue to unrave=
l over the years. It may be painful, but it may in the long run result in a=
 more sustainable equilibrium.
=C2=A0
During this phase, it may not be help=
ful or useful to put the microscope on specific events. It is better to dev=
elop a balanced attitude of compassionate detachment and just pray for peac=
e. Also, as more and more sadhakas do intense sadhana, it may smooth out so=
me of the painful changes.
=C2=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

>Namaste Sir,
>=C2=A0
>That is a variation satisfying the me=
tre. But it is less apt, for the following reasons:
>=C2=A0
>(1) The word "=
tu" indicates some irony or contrast. If you say "He rules the bridge of dh=
arma. Then again, he destroys the path of adharma", there is no such contra=
st. Basically, I see "tu" as a misfit there.
>(2) Bhairava is not necessari=
ly a deity destroying adharma. In fact, he stands more for liberation and f=
or destroying the distinction in one's mind between dharma and adharma. For=
 example, he is depicted as roaming around naked drinking wine.
>=C2=A0
>BT=
W, observe the imagery. Line before says "dharma setu pAlakaM" - the ruler =
of the bridge of dharma. Dharma is merely seen as a bridge here. Bridge to =
what? Obviously bridge over the sea of samsara and into infinite freedom. B=
hairava not only controls the bridge, but his main purpose is to take one i=
nto infinite freedom from that bridge. Thus, swadharma mArga nAshakaM fits =
nicely following that line.
>=C2=A0
>BTW, some people may be tempted to wor=
ship and Bhairava and emulate him by drinking wine or roaming naked in a sm=
ashan. That may not necessarily liberate one. Please note that Bhairava is =
not free becausehe drinks wine and roams naked. He is already free and does=
 those things becausehe is free. In any case, even Bhairava, the deity of d=
estroying right-wrong distinctions in mind and ringing in liberation is des=
cribed as "dharma setu palaka"! Dharma is very important. Until you reach t=
he shore of infinite freedom, you HAVE to stay afloat of the ocean of samsa=
ra, by getting atop the bridge of dharma! Otherwise you will sink in the oc=
ean of samara, toppled by the waves of delusion. Though one needs to jump o=
ff the bridge in the end, "the end" is not anywhere near for most people on=
 earth and they better realize it!
>
>=C2=A0
>This is why I (@homam108) twe=
eted a few weeks back that moksha is irrelevant to 99.9999% people. Instead=
 of reading and thinking about moksha, think about dharma and do your dharm=
a.

the bottom half is worshipped at another location as "Kaali", people may th=
ink of her as Kaali. But the goddess who was moved is the goddess of protec=
tion and balance. This is a case of withdrawal of protection in a delicate =
equilibrium rather than wrath, thought it may seem like the latter.<br>&nbs=
p;<br>(3) Some deities like Kaali, Bhairavi, Dhoomavati etc may indeed by a=
ssociated with fierce destruction. However, the stereotypical image some pe=
ople may have of such deities as wrathful, out-of-control, irritable person=
s is inaccurate.<br> <br>Everyday billions of cells in our bodies beco=
me useless. They block other good cells from functioning. Body has an elabo=
rate system to "kill" them, flush them out of the system and recycle the el=
ements in them, i.e. create new cells. This is a natural process and one wi=
thout which life is will be far less pleasant/sustainable. The force behind=
 this natural process is not irritable or angry. It is just
 something very=
 thoughtful, wise and elaborate. But, if we personify that force, its actio=
ns of killing billions of cells and flushing them out may indeed make it lo=
ok like an angry and irritable person!<br> <br>Deities such as Kaali a=
nd Bhairavi are personifications of the forces behind this natural process =
of destruction, elimination and recycling, within the "macrocosm". Remove t=
he stereotypes from your mind to gain a better understanding of these deiti=
es and genuine love for them (and not fake love out of necessity and fear).=
<br> <br>(4) First of all, let us accept that shifting a temple that w=
as established specifically for protecting this region was an unwise and ba=
d karma. Yet, it is not 100% clear whether what happened is a direct conseq=
uence. In this case, it may very well be. But the bigger point I want to ma=
ke is that we do not really know which karmaphala is arising from which kar=
ma. We often draw convenient conclusions based on our
 beliefs, agendas and=
 conditioning.<br> <br>For example, when hurricane Sandy happened in n=
ortheast US, some Christian conservative commentators in US said that state=
s that were legalizing gay marriage were facing the wrath of God! They prob=
ably believed it genuinely. It was perhaps perfectly logical for the image =
of "god" constructed in their own minds to do it!! But, it may be a silly i=
dea given the image of god constructed in the mind of someone else.<br>&nbs=
p;<br>God is infinite and un-knowable. We all have an *evolving* finite ima=
ge of god in our finite and conditioned minds based on our own *evolving* s=
ense of good and bad, strong and weak, desirable and undesirable, etc. It i=
s wise not to second guess god and associate specific karmas with specific =
karmaphalas, for we can never know with certainty.<br> <br>Having said=
 that, a bad karma can be avoided whether or not it caused a specific karma=
 phala or not!<br> <br>(5) Though everyday
 billions of new cells are =
created in our bodies, billions of old cells are killed and flushed out and=
 trillions of cells sustained, some periods </span><span id=3D"yiv309916994=

Respected=
 sir,<br>With due regards I request you to shed some light upon the recent =
Uttarakhand tragedy. After the tragedy it is now believed that the tragedy =
was due to shifting of Dhari devi temple at Alaknanda river. I read some po=
st by shri Manish ji and blog of shri sanjay rath ji.  <br>My doubt is that=
, in present context how much it is relevant that such tragedies do happen =
by a Devi wrath. As per our believe God is merciful and even in some of you=
r post previously you have said that it is not worthwhile to connect traged=
ies with God or faith for Him?<br>Hope you can elaborate this.<br><br>Best =

 Hindu philosophy taught by many modern gurus, especially of the Ve=
dantic bent, is based on the final target rather than the path(s) one needs=
 to walk, to get to the target. It assumes that you are already close to th=

dhakas like "all is delusion", "everything is the same", "what you do does =
not matter". The greatness of Bhagavad Gita is that it talks about the path=
(s) as well as the target and has something relevant to everyone.<br></div>=
