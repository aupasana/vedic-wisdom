Namaste,

Very good. With practices, mistakes will go away. Also, the beneficial 
results will increase.

I believe Ganesha and Krishna are the most suitable for you.

Regarding mantra, I suggest letting the Swami who gives you mantra diksha 
decide which mantra to give you and just follow his advice.

BTW, it is "Om Namo Naaraayanaaya" and not "Om Namo Naaraayana".

Best regards,
Narasimha
