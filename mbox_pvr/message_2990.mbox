Namaste,
 
I am replying to the vedic-wisdom yahoogroup without revealing y=
our identity, as this may be relevant/useful to some other people. I hope y=
ou won't mind.
 
*        *        *
 
Background for others:
 
This gentle=
man had a telephone conversation with me a few days back. He is an advaitin=
. He was doing some rituals earlier. He happened to read "I Am That" book b=
y Nisargadatta Maharaj, an adwaiti and a liberated master. In the weeks aft=
er reading that book, he had a series of mystical experiences that revealed=
 one idea after another to him. Based on his experiences, he told me that a=
ll that we perceive is an illusion and even knowledge and ignorance are ill=
usions. Is there a need to perform rituals and why? This whole thing is lik=
e a dream and why do we need to do specific things in what we know to be a =
dream?
 
I mostly listened to what he was saying without saying anything, b=
ut said a few things at the end. He said that he sees everything for what i=
t is during an experience, but back to normal at the end of it, e.g. worrie=
d about a sore throat and stuff like that.
 
I told him that that state of =
not having fear or likes or dislikes has to be permanent and not a fleeting=
 experience. I told him it is good to say duality is an illusion, but one n=
eeds to deal with it when one is immersed in that illusion most of the time=
. A fleeting experience of reality and immersion in the illusion again is n=
ot liberation. One needs to strive for a state when one is in that state al=
l the time. To reach that state, it is necessary to pay back one's karmik d=
ebts in the field of duality.
 
I told him that rituals like homam can be p=
erformed without an individual sankalpa, but just for the pleasure of the d=
eity. Thus, one ends up giving something to the universe without considerin=
g whether and what one gets in return. That is conducive to freedom.
 
He p=
ondered on my words for a few days and replied. I will continue the discuss=
ion below with him on the list now.
 
*        *        *
 
Your question i=
s a very important one and addressed by many scriptures such as Upanishads,=
 Yoga Vaasishtham, Bhagavad Gita etc.
 
Vasishtha taught in Yoga Vaasishtha=
m that knowledge (understanding) and action are the two wings with which th=
e bird of soul flies. It is not possible for one wing to reach the correct =
speed at once. As the wings are flapped, one wing will take off, the other =
will take off accordingly, the first wing gains more speed and so on. Event=
ually, when there is balance between the two wings, bird flies off.
 
Perfe=
ct understanding and perfect actions do not come by themselves suddenly. Ac=
tions and understanding work together, balance each other and improve each =
other.
 
One can start off with some understanding and engage in actions th=
at imbibe that understanding. As one engages in more and more actions that =
are aligned with one's dharma, one's understanding becomes better and bette=
r. As one's understanding becomes better and better, it enables actions tha=
t are more and more aligned with one's dharma. Better understanding results=
 in better actions and better actions result in better understanding. You c=
annot separate knowledge from actions. As I said, Vasishtha was very clear =
that knowledge and actions are two wings. Some modern adwaitins erroneously=
 argue: "You are That. There is nothing to do. Even the notion that you are=
 bound and you need to do something to become free is an illusion. You ARE =
That and you ARE free already." They de-emphasize action. But Vasishtha was=
 clear. As I showed in the other mail today, Sri Krishna also taught in Bha=
gavad Gita that some actions aimed at paying off one's karmik debts are qui=
te necessary and should never be given up as long one is embodied.
 
If you=
 experience fear or anxiety or like or dislike or pain or other such things=
 in the field of duality at any time, you are not really thinking like "Tha=
t". The meaning of being That is to be beyond such notions at *all* tismes.=

 
*        *        *
 
Let me give very simple and yet apt analogy.
 
If =
one is in a dream, there is no point in coming in the dream and telling one=
 "this is just a dream. This is not your natural state. Wake up". Merely as=
serting that to one in a dream will not wake one up from the dream! One wil=
l continue to be in the dream. Even if one thinks "this dream is not my rea=
l state. I am actually awake. What I perceive is wakefulness", it will stil=
l be *in the dream*. One is merely awake *in the dream* and not really awak=
e.
 
In order to really wake up from the dream, some things need to happen =
in the dream. One can try to do some things in the dream that are likely to=
 end the dream and wake one up. Thus, the notion that it is not real and me=
rely a dream and hence there is no need to do anything is incorrect. Instea=
d of doing stupid things and prolonging a dream, one can do the right thing=
s and wake up soon.
 
Thus, engage in the right actions in the dream (that =
life in the field of duality is), to wake up to the reality (experience of =
Absolute at all times)!
 
*        *        *
 
As I mentioned in the other=
 mail, constantly self-examine and contemplate. Remove all thoughts of self=
-gratification, pride and expectation from others from the mind. Catch such=
 thoughts at the root and cut them off. Focus your energy on engaging in ac=
tions that *give* things to others and the universe, without any considerat=
ions of self-gratification and with complete oblivion to what you receive i=
n return. Keep doing selfless actions without any expectations. Eventually,=
 your understanding will become perfect and your actions will also become p=
erfect. You will be free then.
 
*        *        *
 
Bottomline: Both und=
erstanding and actions are needed. Actions accompanied by correct understan=
ding are the key. As actions become more perfect and detached, understandin=
g becomes more perfect. As understanding becomes more perfect, actions beco=
me more perfect and detached. At the end, when actions and understanding be=
come perfect, one becomes free. One then realizes that it was all actually =
grace.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
