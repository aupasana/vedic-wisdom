Namaste,
 
The ka-group of consonants represents the fire element. The pa-v=
arga group of consonants represents the air element. Thus, "n(g)" has more =
fire in it and "m" has more air in it.
 
In each group again, the five lett=
ers in the group represent the sub-influence of the five elements. The nasa=
l (anunaasika) in each group shows the element of space (aakaasa). Thus, "n=
(g)" is a combination of space and fire and "m" is space and air. Both are =
fine and serve different purposes. However, when g becomes explicit, the sp=
ace influence becomes less and that is undesirable.
 
Best regards,
Narasim=
ha

  Dear Narasimha ji,
   
  Thanks a lot for this v=
aluable information.
   
  You are right, I have noticed as well that they =
work differently, and hence I asked this question.
   
  I have felt more i=
ntense energy with Shreeng and Hreeng compared to Sheem and Hreem , I guess=
 I have to practice making sure that "g" is 
   
  not explicit at all.
   =

  Thanks again

  Namaste,

  For beejaaksharas, both v=
ersions ending with the nasal in ka-group (ng) and the nasal in pa-group (m=
) are valid. They work differently, but both are valid.

  However, the pro=
blem with the former is that most people cannot pronounce it correctly. The=
 correct pronunciation is to start saying "hreeng" and stop just when you a=
re about to say "g". The sound "g" should not be explicit at all. To pronou=
nce that nasal "n(g)" correctly, you have to think that you are going to sa=
y "ng", but stop just short of "g". It is not easy. Most people end up pron=
ouncing the "g" sound a bit. Instead of making that mistake, it is better t=
o just stick to "hreem".

  Bottomline: The forms hreem and hreen(g) with a=
 silent g are both fine. But hreeng with an explicit g is a bad idea.

  Be=
st regards,
  Narasimha

    Dear N=
arsimha,
     
    Hope you are doing great.
     
    I have a small quest=
ion. 
     
    Someone said that "Hreeing" is more appropriate than "Hreem=
". Would you agree..?
     
    Thanks
