Namaste,

In the episodes before Rama's birth, Valmiki clearly portrays him as an 
avatara of Vishnu.

In "Yoga Vaasishtham", also written by Valmiki, Rama becomes depressed. 
Vasishtha, in the presence of Vishwamitra and other rishis and gods, teaches 
self-knowledge to Rama. Vasishtha reveals the true nature of Rama then and 
Rama remains in samadhi. Vasishtha has to finally enter the Sushumna nadi of 
Rama to disturb his samadhi and bring him back to senses. After that, Rama 
knows who he is.

Rama and Krishna were both avataras of Vishnu. Krishna knew it from the 
beginning. In the case of Rama, sages like Vasishtha, Vishwamitra knew it 
even before Rama's birth, but Rama himself did not know it in the beginning. 
But he too knew it later.

However, Krishna had complete mastery over the duality, while Rama did not. 
Rama had to wade the dual world like normal people. Krishna could do any 
manipulation of the dual world that he wanted.

Best regards,
Narasimha
