Namaste,

If your father has the inclination, the next thing to be done is to see if 
the financial resources are there. Apart from the infrastructure, money is 
needed for the materials on an ongoing basis. Then find a sadhaka (can be a 
purohit or a yogi or a normal person) who is devoted to the Mother and 
interested in doing Chandi homam 3 times a day. Then make arrangements for 
buying the materials, storing them and start homam. This need not be on a 
grand scale, but the person doing should be simple and devoted.

Best regards,
Narasimha
