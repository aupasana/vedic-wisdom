Namaste,
 
This dream presumably happened in Pisces lagna with lagna lord Jupiter in 12th and 9th lord Mars in 5th. There may be something in this dream to aid your own spiritual progress. Except that, I do not think the dream means much literally.
 
*        *        *
 
My take is that this dream is a message to you to start doing pitri tarpana. Pitri tarpana (meaning: satisfying ancestral manes) is a procedure that can be finished in 5-10 min in its shortest form. In fact, a short pitri tarpana used to be an integral part of daily religious sadhana every morning, not so long ago.
 
*        *        *
 
One can download free Pitri tarpana manuals at
 
http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana
 
The manuals explain in detail three versions of the procedure - super-short (5-10 min), short (12-20 min) and regular (30-45 min). Manuals are available with mantras  given in various scripts (English, Sanskrit, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Tamil and Telugu).
 
*        *        *
 
If a pitri or ancestral mane is stuck in pitri loka, it affects one's mind. Suppose a lustful ancestor got stuck upon death in  pitri loka (i.e. the realm of consciousness where mind and its predispositions dominate), instead of progressing to another realm of consciousness or being reborn to fulfil remaining desires. Then minds of some descendants may be genetically/kaarmically predisposed to lust. Same with other weaknesses.
 
Though one can look at a pitri as an external being,  everything external maps internally. One's pitris are present within one as various tendencies based on genetic and kaarmik predispositions. Freeing a pitri and granting him rebirth is essentially the same as freeing one's own mind from certain genetic and kaarmik predispositions.
 
*        *        *
 
In astrology, horas in hora chart are ruled by Sun (fire) or Moon (water). Sun's horas are controlled by devas (gods) and Moon's horas are controlled by pitris (ancestral manes).
 
We all have a physical body (lagna), a mind (Moon) and a soul (Sun). Pitris are beings that self-identify more strongly with the mind (Moon) and they are best propitiated using the medium of water (tarpana). Devas are beings that self-identify more strongly with the soul (Sun) and they are best propitiated using the medium of fire (homam).
 
If one does a 30-minute homam to any deity (e.g. Ganapathi) and a 10-minute pitri tarpana everyday (or every weekend), it can accelerate one's spiritual progress and make everything else one does more effective. In fact, a fire ritual and a tarpana were part of the daily routine of learned Hindus not long ago.
 
*        *        *
 
Modern world looks down upon rituals, but rituals are externalized actions that are carefully designed and that eventually bring internal transformation on repetition.
 
Every action and every thought of ours has an impact and leaves an imprint on our consciousness. If we want to shape our consciousness in a particular useful way, some repeated actions coupled with some thoughts can be used.
 
Thinking of stuck ancestors and praying for their freedom, while water flows over some important energy centers in the palm, is certainly a useful exercise. Contemplating  a deity while imagining him/her in fire is certainly a useful exercise.
 
*        *        *
 
The decrease of dharma and increase of adharma in the world places our earth in a precarious position. Though very patient, Mother Earth cannot let her children destroy themselves with their careless actions that ruin earth and irresponsible inaction in important matters. If Mother Earth takes corrective action to change the course, it will be painful for many people. For changes to occur smoothly and relatively painlessly, we need to maintain a certain level of dharma in the world.
 
If a few thousands of people are doing homam to various deities on a regular basis, without any selfish material motivations but to just increase dharma in the world and to progress spiritually in the process, it will make a big difference to the world.
 
In fact, the divine Mother appeared and asked my guru in March 2006 to teach simple homam procedures to anybody who is interested in spiritual progress and help increase dharma in the world. I see that some people who never even lit a lamp in their lives are doing a daily homam today and I am convinced that the Mother's will will be fulfilled in time.
 
Detailed manuals of a short homam ritual to various deities are available at:
 
http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam
 
*        *        *
 
Interestingly, I was thinking a few days back to write a few lines about the importance of pitri tarpana and homam on yahoogroups. Your mail gives me the opportunity..
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
