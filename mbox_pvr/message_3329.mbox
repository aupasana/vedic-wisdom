Namaste Sundeep,
=A0
Western philosophers are good and smart people, but th=
eir understanding of the Absolute (Brahman) and its Manifestation (Duality)=
 is nowhere near that of Rishis in my view. I do not see a need to reconcil=
e things. If you are interested in the findings of rishis, study eastern ph=
ilosophy without carrying the *baggage* of western philosophy.

Before taking an issue with th=
is approach, let me answer your specific question.
=A0
Ahamkara is not the =
hole in the doughnut. Ahamkara is the "space" that fills the entire doughnu=
t, including the hole in the center and the outside. Manas (sensory mind), =
its organs of perception and organs of action, buddhi (logical mind) and pa=
rt of chitta (memory) that is akin to a cache in computer memory is part of=
 the outside of doughnut. Part of chitta (memory) that is uncached (stored =
from *forgotten* existences) is in the hole in the middle.

=A0
There are a lot of bl=
ind people in the world. Sensory experiences related to vision are unknown =
to them. Can they dismiss explanations originating from vision as "misconce=
ptions/subjective interpretations"?
=A0
Why should it be common experience =
to "all"? If some virus invades the world and takes away vision from 99.999=
9% population of the world, will observations made based on vision by the 0=
.0001% people still having vision be a valid basis for objective inquiry/ex=
planations?
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Not all=
 non-sensory observations are subjective. There is some uniformity in non-s=
ensory observations too. Just as two people watching a cloth with their eye=
s may independently say it is "red" in color, similarly two people observin=
g something using non-sensory observation may say the same thing about it.
=
=A0
As a simple example, I know someone who internally "heard" a specific b=
eejaakshara when his Kundalini rose to a specific chakra for the first time=
. At that time, he did not know much about Kundalini and chakras. Some mont=
hs later, he bought some books and read them. He was surprised to learn tha=
t that beejaakshara was indeed associated with that chakra in tantra litera=
ture. As he did not know all this before the internal experience, it was no=
t a case of pre-conditioned imagination causing an experience/hallucination=
. Without being influenced by any tantra texts, he experienced something sp=
ecific that was well-captured by pre-existing tantra texts. I know several =
such cases.
=A0
>From my own experience and experience of people I trust, I =
know for sure that truths captured by sUpanishads and tantra texts were *in=
dependently* experienced by several people. I also know that people can exp=
erience and realize those truths even now, even without reading the books a=
nd being conditioned by them.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0 *
=A0
>From my point of view, there is nothing pristine about observa=
tions made with sensory perception. Just as some non-sensory perception can=
 be hallucination, similarly some *sensory* perception can also be hallucin=
ation!
=A0
More importantly, the truth that can be captured by sensory perc=
eption is quite limited. From my experience, I am convinced that the Absolu=
te, a glimpse of which can liberate one from the cycle of happiness and sad=
ness, is beyond sensory perception, as declared by rishis in the past.
=A0
=
I humbly, and yet firmly, suggest to seekers that a fresh study of eastern =
philosophy without carrying the *baggage* of western philosophy will be mor=
e productive. More importantly, a direct individual experience is the only =
way to understand things correctly and theoretical studies can only go so f=
ar. Study if you must, but do some sadhana and try to overcome the shadripu=
s. That will help far more than studying volumes.
