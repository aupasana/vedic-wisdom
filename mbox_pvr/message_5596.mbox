Namaste Sir,
 
All the 14 worlds (7 higher worlds - bhur, bhuvar, suvar etc=
 and 7 lower worlds - atala, vitala, kutala etc) and their inhabitants, inc=
luding deities and demons, live in one's body in microcosmic form (and, mic=
rocosm is identical to the macrocosm). Each deity is a personification of s=
ome qualities inside us. Different qualities endow us with different kinds =
of shakti (capability to get certain things done).
 
These deities or shakt=
is exist in a human-like form too, but subtler forms exist as light or soun=
d. They are basically representations of certain highly desirable qualities=
 within us.
 
*        *        *
 
Human like forms where there are mulipl=
e heads, hands etc, carrying specific set of weapons, are symbolic personif=
ications. Vishnu has 4 hands, symbloizing the 4 purusharthas - dharma (righ=
teousness), artha (serving purpose), kaama (desires) and moksha (liberation=
). Mahalakshmi, deity of madhyamacharitra of Chandipath, has 18 hands, symb=
olizing the solar/lunar (pingala/ida) variations of the nine planetary ener=
gies. Durga has 10 hands, symbolizing the creatiton of a fort (around one's=
 consciousness) that is fortified and protected from the ten directions. Li=
ke this, how many heads and how many hands a deity has and what the deity h=
olds in those hands is symbolic. For example, Vishnu's Sudarsana chakra cut=
s down anything and makes one see clearly (su-darsana=3Dclear vision). The =
only clear vision is to see ParaBrahma in all. Any other vision is imperfec=
t vision. In other words, Sudarsana chakra removes confusions and attachmen=
ts of the field of duality and gives equanimity and sthitapragyata describe=
d in Gita. Khadga (sword) cuts things in a hand-to-hand combat, i.e. it sho=
ws cutting wrong notions by bravely taking them on. Gada (mace) hits hard, =
i.e. it shows suppressing and killing wrong notions by sheer force and inte=
nsity of sadhana. Dhanus and bana (bow and arrow) is released from a distan=
ce with good aim, i.e. they show attacking specific wrong notions with pati=
ence and good aim. Like this, different weapons are symbolic of different w=
ays in which our internal enemies are attacked by the good qualities within=
 us (deities).
 
*        *        *
 
Of course, this does not mean deitie=
s do not exist in those forms. Though Swami Vivekanansa once famously said =
that a human being imagines god as a superhuman with many heads and hands, =
while a buffalo may imagine god as a super-baffalo with many horns etc, I k=
now that one can experience deities in human-like forms even though one may=
 never actively or passively imagine (or read in books describing) in that =
form in this life. Such notions of deities may be imprinted on the consciou=
sness in this life or even a previous life!
 
After all, though what we exp=
erience around us is a delusion, it is a uniform delusion, i.e. we are all =
characters in an elaborate visualization (or dream) of our Creator. So we e=
xperience certain things uniformly. Even if I never create a human-like for=
m of a deity in my mind consciously, my mind may still have access to such =
a form!
 
*        *        *
 
Apart from human-like forms, one can experi=
ence deities as light or sound. For example, see the portion that starts wi=
th "I was sleeping oneday" in:
 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom=
/message/3481
 
In this episode, a deity was experienced as the sound of a =
specific beejaakshara. One experienced a universe that was filled with that=
 sound and with bliss and nothing else. One's self-awareness was that of a =
small particle in that universe. That too was an experience of a deity. Mor=
eover, parts of this experience were independently verified by a third part=
y, suggesting that it wasn't a hallucination.
 
After all, experiences can =
be hallucinations too. And, it is very easy for a human mind to hallucinate=
. But, hallucinations increase ego and do not cause internal transformation=
, while real experience of divinity causes internal transformation and take=
s one towards Satya.
 
*        *        *
 
Just as water takes the shape =
of a container it is poured in, divinity takes forms based on how we are ab=
le to and willing to perceive it and deal with it. You can take water in a =
small glass or cup or bowl or jar and keep it in front of you. You can drin=
k it. You can pour it on you. Or you can jump into a pool or lake or river =
or ocean and swim in it. There are many ways to experience and deal with wa=
ter. So is the case with divinity!
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
