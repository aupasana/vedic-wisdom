Namaste friends,

I just want to adress one misconception about my mail that I detected in 
several public and private replies.

To use an analogy, I am just a peach tree, but some people seem to 
mistaken me for a mango tree. I feel no burden or any negative emotion. 
I will continue to share my peaches with people, gladly, freely, 
fearlessly, unabashedly, confidently and honestly. Whatever opinion 
people want to hold of this tree and its peaches, good or bad, they are 
free to do so.

All I am doing is to point out that I am a peach tree and not a mango 
tree. After that, whether people continue to pick my peaches (either 
accepting their being mere peaches or still believing that they are 
actually mangoes) or go elsewhere looking for real mangoes, is their 
call.

It will not upset me if anyone sees me as a guru. But they should 
realize that I do not see myself as a guru. Irresepctive of all this, I 
will continue to do whatever I have been doing until now.

Happy Guru Pournima! May Sadguru's blessings be with us and may Guru 
Tattva flourish in us!

Best regards,
Narasimha
