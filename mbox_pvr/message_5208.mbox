Namaste,
 
I was referring to Vyasa'a Sanskrit version.
 
One can access ea=
sy English translations by Srila Prabhupada of various scriptures (includin=
g Srimad Bhagavatam) at http://vedabase.net.
 
In Potana's Telugu version, =
chapters may be arranged slightly differently. I do not have the text and c=
annot comment.
 
Yes, Potana is special among Telugu poets. Poets like Pota=
na and musicians like Thyagaraja dedicated themselves to Lord Rama, and pre=
ferred to live in poverty and write (or sing) on god, rather than writing (=
or singing) on kings and mundane matters.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

 brahmanas. What it means is that one desirous of power, influence, money a=

However in numerous instances in the past, I've heard through friends and c=
lose uncles that astrology can have a severe adverse impact on yourself (as=
trologer) and yrou family. This may sound a very immature comment, but I th=

PS: I am drawn to astology more from an academic perspective of how it infl=
uences our life and how ignorant we are of this power around us. My goal is=
 to get the little understanding that I can of this marvelous science and e=
ducate our next generation so they are not blinded by modern society and de=
