Namaste,
 
A Hindu saint need not really master 6 darshanas and be proficie=
nt in Tarka.
 
The one and only goal of a Hindu saint is to experience god.=
 One may master other things such as shad-darshanas on the path to experien=
cing god, but that is not necessary.
 
However, people who have realized Se=
lf and whose individual ego has been effaced and suffused with the Divine u=
sually carry such Light and Knowledge with them that they can fulfil their =
dharma even if they have not formally read any books. No wonder Vallalar or=
 Swami Vivekananda or Ramana Maharshi never failed in an argument as you sa=
id. They would never enter a debate unless they see it as their dharma. Onc=
e they enter a debate, they would not waver or be unsure.
 
Some saints may=
 not debate or even talk. Ramana Maharshi was silent for much of the time a=
nd yet people around him received so much peace, bliss and knowledge. It is=
 not at all necessary for a saint to debate and defeat others.
 
But one wo=
uld hardly see a great saint agree to a debate and then evade the questions=
 with polite words. I am sorry, but that sounds like a confused Arjuna just=
 before the Kurukshetra war.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
