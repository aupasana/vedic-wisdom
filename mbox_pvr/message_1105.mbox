Namaste friends,

I would like to express my reservations on a=
 couple of issues. It is funny that I should be typing this email on an Eka=
dashi day, when many Vaishnavas fast irrespective of their horoscopes.

> >=
> Here is my point and view about the question raised. 2nd bhava is

e bhava of Vishnu, sustainer, and if we fast on the day of UL in

ouse, we bring insult to Vishnu who provides the food for us.

My dear Zora=
n, please allow me to express my disagreement.

Austerities can never be se=
en as an insult to Vishnu. Self-deprivation of 2nd house matters such as fo=
od (fasting) or speech (mouna vrata - vow of silence) are austerities. Givi=
ng up food or speech is not an insult to Vishnu just as giving up sex (i.e.=
 brahmacharya) is not an insult to Sukracharya (Venus).

Various gods besto=
w various things on us, some at the gross physical level and some at the su=
btle spiritual level. As we overcome our dependendency on gross things, we =
make progress at the subtle level.

If one eats food, a good amount of inte=
rnal fire (and subtle internal energy associated with it) is used for diges=
ting it and for generating physical energy from it. If one fasts, that subt=
le energy is unused and available for other things. This is a tremendous be=
nefit. As a result, one can better digest mantras and spiritual food availa=
ble all around one.

The mantra one meditates with at the end of a day's fa=
sting is far more effective than at other times. The conservation of energy=
 otherwise spent on digestion or speech will enable far more effective mant=
ra meditation. So fast or keep mouna and then meditate with a mantra, to ma=
ximize the effect of the mantra.

 the way out.

Why does a rashi carry the energy of vaara only and not that=
 of the tithi???? Why does rashi represent vaara or fire?

After all, Rudra=
 rules over the element of fire and Gouri rules over the element of water a=
nd one worships Gouri at the time of marriage. Moreover, Venus (water) is t=
he karaka for marriage. So one could even say that UL/marriage is represent=
ed by water element and fasting on UL lord's tithi brings the element of wa=
ter (prosperity and well-being) to one's marriage (UL)? One could even say =
that fasting on the weekday of UL lord should be prohibited as it brings th=
e fire element represented by weekday to the water of UL and causes "gandan=
ta"!

Seriously, however, this kind of stretching of gandanta concepts is q=
uite illogical.

Now one more thing: Marriage is a yoga between two souls a=
nd why not suggest fasting on the yoga day of the UL lord?

* * *

erious doshas.

Picking tithi based on house (12th house - Dwadashi, 4th ho=
use - Chaturthi) is illogical as there are 12 houses only and more tithis.
=

I have realized one thing over the years - If something is not structurall=
y sound, it is most likely false knowledge.

* * *

I can categorically dec=
lare one thing with utmost confidence. You pick any weekday or tithi and ta=
ke a vow to fast or do mouna vrata (remain silent) on that weekday or tithi=
 and meditate with a particular mantra (any) at the end of the day. You can=
 take a vow to keep that practice for a certain duration of time (say, a fe=
w months or years) for a specific purpose. Take a vow and keep the vrata fo=
r the duration. If brahmacharya can be kept for the duration of the vrata, =
there is nothing like it!

If you keep such a vrata sincerely, you will mak=
e positive progress towards achieving your purpose and definitely not go ba=
ckwards, irrespective of what is said by technical calculations based on ou=
r half-baked Jyotish knowledge.

* * *

My friends, use the Jyotish knowled=
ge available, but do realize that it is imperfect and corrupted. Why is onl=
y the UL lord important? So many planets may have so many kinds of influenc=
e on UL in a chart. And UL is one of several factors showing marriage. Ther=
e may be various influences in a chart showing marriage. Is our thumb rule =
of using UL lord's weekday missing some important factors? Quite possible!
=

But, despite some arbitrariness and imperfection, if a thumb rule allows y=
ou to pick an austerity with confidence and create the mental feeling that =
you are doing the best possible thing for your situation, it is good. After=
 all, what is critical is to do *some* austerity to burn the blocking karma=
, with a positive frame of mind about what you are doing.

But, if endless =
theorization and complicated technicalities evolving from the thumb rule ar=
e creating doubts and confusion in the minds of people as they consider an =
austerity, that is useless and totally missing the point.

Some people tend=
 to resort to heavy theorization based on very shaky grounds. I suggest goi=
ng back to the basics, thinking clearly and keeping things simple.

Gem sto=
nes may harm when used incorrectly. But, austerities like prayers, fasting,=
 mouna vrata and brahmacharya will NEVER do you any harm. If your body can =
take fasting, you can do it on any weekday or tithi without too many calcul=
ations.

Best regards,
Narasimha
