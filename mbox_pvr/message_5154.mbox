Namaste Satya Prakash garu,
 
Welcome to the list and it is a pleasure to h=
ave your learned company here.
 
Traditional conventions are not without ba=
sis, but I suggest we need to understand their motivation.
 
*        *    =
    *
 
When one chants long prayers such as Chandipath, Vishnu sahasra naa=
ma stotra, Aditya Hridayam etc, it requires a lot of conscious mental activ=
ity. One mostly cannot go into samadhi while chanting them (though there ca=
n be exceptions). On the other hand, when one chants Gayatri mantra or asht=
akshari mantra or dwadasakshari mantra or panchakshari mantra or navarna ma=
ntra or various beeja mantras or other small mantras, it requires a minimal=
 amount of conscious mental activity. With repetitive and minimal mental ac=
tivity, there is a possibility of momentary cessation of mental activity an=
d entering samadhi OR awakening of Kundalini and progress towards samadhi.
=
 
If one reaches samadhi directly when Kundalini awakens, things are fine. =
But, that may not happen. Kundalini can take many different paths and go to=
 different places. Depending on the impurities in various nadis, various ex=
periences are possible. If a sadhaka is unprepared to handle the experience=
, it can create problems. One can experience something nice and become prou=
d and egoistic and get stuck there. One can experience a very fierce form o=
f divine and get scared to death or go mad. Many possibilities are there.
 =

Thus, practices that can truly awaken one were kept limited to the initiat=
ed. Guru would assess the progress and readiness of a sadhaka and initiate =
one when one is ready.
 
*        *        *
 
However, there are a few thi=
ngs that are different in today's times:
 
(1) There are very few people wh=
o are ready to experience something. Most people will just do sadhana, burn=
 some basic blocking karmas and not really experience much. At most, some p=
eople will experience an awakening and just a little movement of Kundalini.=

(2) There are very few gurus who are indeed capable of assessing and guidi=
ng a sadhaka well. Most initiations are a mere formality.
(3) With the insi=
stence on initiation etc, we may be blocking, in the coming years, the very=
 few sadhakas who MAY actually achieve some progress with a mantra, from ev=
en trying it.
(4) If a sadhaka surrenders and has the attitude of "I do not=
 know the right way. I am just doing what I am capable of. Please take care=
 of me Mother", none of the risks I mentioned above will really apply.
(5) =
Especially if one does not engage in raja yoga/hatha yoga practices that ar=
e meant to forcefully awaken and raise Kundalini and if one does not consci=
ously think in terms of raising Kundalini, one is safe.
(6) If one is not l=
ooking for any specific results and doing a mantra just for spiritual progr=
ess with a sense of surrender, one is safe.
 
*        *        *
 
Apart f=
rom assessing the readiness, there are some more functions performed by an =
initiating guru:
 
(1) A guru can jumpstart one's sadhana with a mantra and=
 results can come faster.
 
However, this expects a guru of some caliber an=
d achievement with the mantra. After all, if one wants a one-on-one audienc=
e with Sachin Tendulkar or Roger Federer or Barack Obama, being introduced =
to them by someone they know and someone that had a one-on-one audience wit=
h them earlier can be helpful (instead of introducing by oneself). If someo=
ne who merely read more about them but is not any closer to them tries to i=
ntroduce you to them, will it even get their attention?
 
Now-a-days, most =
people do not have access to gurus who have experienced the divine with a m=
antra. Such people are very rare. One's best bet is to do sadhana by onesel=
f, using all the tools given by rishis and various spiritual masters. When =
one is ready (and if it is needed), a guru may come and take one's sadhana =
to the next level.
 
(2) A guru can mould the correct attitude in sadhaka b=
efore a sadhana is taken up.
 
However, there are sadhakas initiated in pow=
erful mantras and not having the right attitude. For example, I know people=
 initiated into Bagalamukhi mantra and trying to use it to win litigation. =
If one does not know that a "Mahavidya" (supreme knowledge) is for overcomi=
ng conditioning and realizing self and not for winning court cases, one's i=
nitiation is no good.
 
On the other hand, I know some people not formally =
initiated into Chandipath, but doing Chandi homam daily with saptashati and=
 also navarna mantra. I know that they do not have any specific material go=
als and are overcoming the few desires that were originally there at the ba=
ck of the mind. The are making quick progress spiritually and their thinkin=
g is getting transformed nicely. Despite having no formal initiation, aren'=
t they worshipping Chandi as a Mahavidya?
 
Bottomline is that one can moul=
d one's own attitude through a formal initiation or through reading scriptu=
res, satsanga and constant contemplation. One thing may work better in one =
case and another thing in another case.
 
(3) A guru can teach the correct =
procedure of a sadhana.
 
However, role of procedural correctness in succes=
s is a higher in sadhanas for specific results than sadhana for spiritual p=
rogress. I maintain that the art of getting specific results from sadhanas =
is being hidden more and more as Kali progresses, for a reason. I suggest t=
hat it is useless to even think in those terms and pursue it.
 
Mantras lik=
e navarna mantra can just be meditated on, without any specific procedure. =
When one is ready and pure enough, they can give one an experience of the d=
ivine. Mantras like Siddha Kunjika stotra, that codify several specific sad=
hanas to get specific results, are anyway inaccessible to most people of th=
is age! They are only available in codified form and gurus who can decode t=
hem will keep disappearing more and more.
 
*        *        *
 
> For tho=
se who are already doing Sri Sri Chandi path without initiation, there is
>=
 no need to worry or be confused. ... Please keep doing whatever you are do=
ing.
 
Given this statement, the difference of opinion between us are very =
subtle.
 
One word on guilt here. If someone is doing a practice and feels =
a sense of guilt, it blocks the practice from working effectively. Please d=
o whatever sadhana you do, without a sense of guilt. If you have the sense =
of guilt, work on overcoming it. If you cannot overcome it, it may be a goo=
d idea to find a sadhana with which you feel comfortable and have no sense =
of guilt.
 
> Things will happen on their own accord in the natural flow. L=
eave the rest to
> the compassionate Goddess.
 
That's the bottomline. Even=
 if one were initiated, it would be quite difficult to not leave things to =
the Goddess and make things happen as one wanted. Start sadhana with some l=
evel of surrender. Then, sadhana will help increase the level of surrender.=
 
 
*        *        *
 
Nagraj garu,
 
The opinion referred to in your qu=
estion 2 is not without basis. But again, we need to understand the motivat=
ion to put it in the right perspective.
 
If one experiences divine through=
 sadhana with Gayatri mantra (or any mantra), then it is easy for one to ex=
perience divine with another mantra. One can just pick up a mantra, do it a=
nd experience relatively quickly.
 
However, if one was merely initiated in=
 Gayatri mantra (or any mantra) and did not really make much spiritual prog=
ress with it, that does not place one in any kind of advantage when it come=
s to sadhana with another mantra. That is my opinion.
 
Best regards,
Naras=
imha

of the confusion on translation of mantras needs some clarification as ther=
e seems to be some unnecessary confusion. A few pointers:
>

 various sacred chants embedded within the Vedas, Puranas, Agamas etc. Broa=
dly speaking such sacred chants can be categorised as mantras, stotras, kav=
achas, dhyanams etc. Some stotras too are also treated as mahamantras and m=
antras.  The Samhita portion of the Vedas too is referred to as mantras.
> =
 
> 2.	Undoubtedly mantras and stotras have to be chanted in the original. =
Reading a translation is not even comparable to chanting the original chant=
. So far it is fine.
> 
> 3.	Whilst mantra, stotra and kavacha are all base=
d on Sabda/Vak, tradition makes a distinction between them.
>      
> 4.	As=
 per the traditional view one doesn't need to be initiated to chant a stotr=
a or dhyanam. The case is not the same with most mantras. Mantras containin=
g bijaksharas, agamic mantras, mantras of Mahavidyas etc need initiation. T=
his is the traditional view. Mantras from the Veda Samhita are not the same=
 as these other mantras that need initiation, which are generally referred =
to as Agamic/Tantrik mantras. Whatever you call these mantras the actual id=
ea is that these mantras are integral parts of larger and distinct spiritua=
l specialities that need initiation, as in the case of Mahavidyas such as K=
ali or Sri.
>  
> 5.	Vishnusahasranama, Sivasahasranama, Aditya hrdayam etc=
 do not need initiation as they fall under stotra category only. Lalitasaha=
sranama and Devi Mahatmyam are traditionally viewed not MERELY as stotras o=
r parts of puranas. They have a larger status as integral parts of a Mahavi=
dya sadhana. Chanting them without initiation is not recommended especially=
 when the reader combines the navarna or shodashi mantras too as an integra=
l part of the chanting.
>            
> 6.	I know from personal interaction=
 that acharyas belonging to both Kanchi as well as Sringeri paramparas reco=
mmend initiation for both the sadhanas of Sri Sri Chandi and Sri Vidya alon=
g with their respective NAVAKSHARI AND SHODASAKSHARI mantras which are trea=
ted as an INTEGRAL LIMB (ANGA) of the sadhana. Acharyas of both these tradi=
tions hold that one needs to be initiated to chant the Navarna as well as s=
hodashakshari mantras.
>  
> 7.	Recapping my earlier stance, Devi Mahatmyam=
 is a great text that has an independent status by itself as part of a Maha=
vidya. It is simultaneously a Mahavidya, a Yogasastra as well as an Advaiti=
c text in the spirit of the Upanishads. ***As a Mahavidya the Navakshari is=
 an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi path***. Thus tradition holds that one =
needs to be initiated to chant it. However if one wishes to benefit from th=
e Yoga-Vedanta or Sacred myth aspects of the Devi Mahatmyam, , reading the =
sacred myth in the vernacular has been recommended in my write-up, as chant=
ing the original along with the navakshari  amounts to practicing the sadha=
na of a Mahavidya. In that case it is recommended to be initiated and go th=
rough the specialised sadhanas properly under guidance.
>  
> 8.	Arguably i=
f an uninitiated person reads the Devi Mahatmyam in the original Sanskrit a=
s part of the *Pauranik* approach and not as a Mahavidya, it has an inheren=
t problem in our times.  The problem with attempting to do a parayana of De=
vi Mahatmyam from texts alone (without initiation) is that most readers ina=
dvertently end up also chanting the Navarna mantra or stotras such as the S=
iddhakunjika stotram which too contain the bijaksharas.
>  
> 9.	I you care=
fully peruse my write-up on the Devi Mahatmyam, forget translating, nowhere=
 do I put down the Navarna mantra even in writing. Neither have I attempted=
 to write a commentary on it. Translations of mantras do not have the power=
 of the original mantra as Sabda or Vak. However it is recommended to know =
the essence or import (artha) of the mantra and its sadhana while chanting =
it. Infact `artha' is the import, the essence of `Vak', not a translation! =

> 
> 10.	For those who are already doing Sri Sri Chandi path without initi=
ation, there is no need to worry or be confused. There has to be a certain =
level of samskara to be attracted to Sri Sri Chandi path itself. We all hav=
e it. Otherwise we would not be doing it (initiation or no initiation). Ple=
ase keep doing whatever you are doing. Just be cautious not to do sakama sa=
dhana. As Narasimha garu has rightly pointed out it is better to just do th=
e sadhana WITHOUT asking for any favours or results. That attitude itself w=
ill reduce a lot of the potential problem. Things will happen on their own =
accord in the natural flow. Leave the rest to the compassionate Goddess.   =
