Subject: Extinguishing a lamp forcibly

Namaste,

I visited someone's pradosha pooja when I visited Texas last week. The 
pooja was very nice and sincere and I loved it, but I noticed one bad 
practice and honestly told them what I thought. I want to share the same 
with all of you.

Showing deepam or lamp to the lord is one of the upacharas (services) 
performed in the pooja after the abhishekam (bathing). In some 
traditions, they show multiple lamp setups with multiple numbers of 
wicks, each setup with a specific mantra. While the abhishekam and 
upacharas were going on, I was sitting with eyes closed and meditating 
with Gayatri mantra. After the showing of various lamps, I felt 
something negative and opened my eyes. I saw that one person was 
forcibly extinguishing the fire in each wick with a rose petal.

God knows if the idol or Shiva lingam used in a pooja has divine 
presence or not, but live moving fire DOES have god in it. It is not at 
all a good idea to extinguish fire forcibly. If keeping tens of wicks 
burning is not practical, put very little oil in each wick so that it 
lights for a small time only. If you can't wait, then don't light so 
many wicks. Just light 1-5 wicks and show them with all mantras. That is 
far better than showing a lamp with 21 wicks, another lamp with another 
number of wicks and so on and then forcibly extinguishing all the tens 
of wicks. Even if an auspicious material like rose petal is used to 
press and extinguish, that does not make it acceptable.

Best regards,
Narasimha
