Namaste,

In some quarters, there is a view that only abhishekam (=
bathing) is 
advisable for Rudra and not homam (fire worship). They think t=
hat Rudra is 
full of fire and fire worship increases the fire and bathing =
cools down the 
fire.

However, any deity can be called in fire, even fiery=
 deities. There is no 
harm in calling a fiery planet like Mars or Sun in f=
ire and doing homam with 
their mantras, as suggested by Maharshi Parasara =
(father of Vyasa). Also, 
Rudra homam is done at many temples. Traditionall=
y, homam is done with 
1/10th of the count of Rudrabhishekam.

Rudra is lik=
e a bowman who releases the fruits of your karmas like an arrow. 
Homam rea=
lly accelerates this. Moreover, Rudra namakam is a long veda mantra 
and it=
 is nearly impossible for most of us to pronounce it correctly. Just 
like =
Chandi homam, one should do Rudra homam if one is surrendered to the 
Lord =
and prepared to face the music for ANY karmas done before and be done 
with=
 them. Of course, after a few painful blocking karmas are gotten over 
with=
, one can make tremendous spiritual progress. But, if one wants to go 
slow=
ly, I suggest that Chandi homam and Rudra homam are not for that person.

I=
 wanted to distribute a manual for a Shiva homam with simple Shiva mantras.=
 
But, somehow, the inspiration from inside has not come yet and it has not=
 
happened.

Best regards,
Narasimha
