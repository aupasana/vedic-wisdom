Dear Narsimhaji,
I am glad to know this and perhaps=
 I will be the lucky person to start the first center in India. Money is no=
 problem when Jagdamba is with me. I will be happy to be the instrument in =
this great devine mission. First I will start this at the place near Dwarka=
. This is the extreme west coast of India.. I have stayed there for 7 years=
 and good contacts are there. It may be at Okha port or Near Harsiddhi temp=
le near Dwarka or near Gopnath (?) one of the Dwadash Jyotirlingam near Dwa=
rka. You just pray for me and also tell Manishji also to bless me so that I=
 can succeed. Next I will think for Ujjain..

=EF=BB=BF 
Namaste Ashwin ji,
=C2=A0
My guru's idea is to start=C2=A0four =
such centers in east, west, north and=C2=A0south parts of India and then=C2=
=A0establish one in Ujjain.
=C2=A0
The idea with each center is as followin=
g: It should be in some peaceful and calm place that is easily accessible b=
y modern transportation and yet a little away from the hustle and bustle of=
 modern life. There need not be a big or famous temple nearby. Buy a few ac=
res of land (for possible expansion in future) and construct a homa kundam =
built in open space with four pillars on the four sides and a high roof on =
the top to protect from rain. The area is open on all the four sides and co=
vered only on the top. Close to it, a small one or two room structure is bu=
ilt to store materials.
=C2=A0
A priest or a sadhaka is employed. His main =
qualification is that he should be a sincere devotee of the Mother and inte=
rested in a simple lifestyle dedicated to Her. His job is to do one Chandi =
homam in the morning, one more in forenoon, have lunch, relax in the aftern=
oon and do one more Chandi homam in the evening. Keep doing it day in and d=
ay out. There are no idols to worship and no other rituals to do.
=C2=A0
Th=
is=C2=A0will pretty much take up all his time and hence enough money should=
 be arranged to take care of the priest and his family. If the priest is no=
t well-versed in homam or Chandi homam, that is no problem. He can be train=
ed. But, the most important thing is that he should be committed to this an=
d devoted to the Mother. If one has the basic simplicity, innocence, devoti=
on=C2=A0and purity, other things will fall in place by themselves.
=C2=A0
B=
uying of the land and construction of room and homa kundam (with roof and p=
illars) is a one-time expense. Salary of the priest and materials like ghee=
, wood etc for homam are an ongoing expense. This project requires a good a=
mount of money and energy.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
After a center is =
established and sadhana progresses in each center, slowly the presence of M=
other will be established there. Once that happens, the sadhaka will start =
making faster progress. As he becomes purer and purere, the sadhana will ge=
nerate more and more energy.
=C2=A0
After establishing 4 other centers, a c=
enter in Ujjain is to be started. The sadhana being done at the Chandi homa=
m centers will have a catalytic influence on the homam movement and many ma=
ny people will start doing different kinds of homas around the world. This =
will have a major impact on dharma in the world. That is what he was told.

=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
I did not want to force or impose on anybody=
. So this has waited. When the time comes, people who will make this happen=
 will come and take charge.
=C2=A0
Time has probably not yet come for Ujjai=
n. But if there is a village in Gujarat or Maharashtra where you can do thi=
s, please consider. But please realize that this requires money commitment =
and also a committed sadhaka.
=C2=A0

Narasimha

No, we have not yet acted on that instruction. I am pl=

=C2=A0
But, establishing the centr=

Namaste friends,=


Shree Maa was referred to here. Someone sent me a few snippets from an 
i=
nterview posted on her website. Please see below.

It is interesting that s=
he considers Ramakrishna Paramahamsa as her guru. It 
is interesting that R=
amakrishna told her she had to "do fire ceremonies and 
show what is truth"=
 and "at that time the whole world will be peace". This 
is similar to what=
 my guru was told by Divine Mother when she appeared to 
him during Shata C=
handi homam at Chennai.

She told him that many people are and will be born=
 who will perform a short 
fire ritual on a regular basis, establish sanata=
na dharma and peace in the 
world and also make quick spiritual progress in=
dividually in that process. 
Shree Maa's statement about what Ramakrishna t=
old her is along similar 
lines.

My guru was also told by Mother that a fe=
w centres of regular Chandi homam 
should be established around the world, =
where Chandi homam is done 3 times a 
day. These places do not need to be n=
ear any temples or famous places and 
can be anywhere. The ritual need not =
be elaborate. For example, there is no 
need to offer silk sarees etc in fi=
re. A simple ritual with bare minimum 
offerings is enough, but it needs to=
 be performed 3 times everyday. When a 
few such centres are established, i=
t will apparently lead to a chain of 
events that will help re-establish sa=
natana dharma.

Though not 3 times a day, these people have done a Chandi h=
omam everyday for 
3 years in the same place and finished 1000 such homas. =
That is fantastic! 
It is the sadhana and purity of sadhakas that creates e=
nergy and brings 
deities to a place. While several ancient temples are wit=
hout any divine 
presence these days, new places of divine presence may be =
created by pure 
souls engaged in selfless sadhana for establishing dharma =
in the world.

As I mentioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Shata Chandi hom=
am during which 
Mother appeared and gave instructions to my guru on spread=
ing homam was 
taken on Ramakrishna' s birth anniversary and the time of sa=
nkalpa was within 
a few minutes from the actual Tithi Pravesha time of the=
 birth anniversary. 
All of this was a coincidence and we were unaware of t=
his significance when 
we decided the muhurta. It is interesting to know th=
at Ramakrishna did 
mention fire ceremonies specifically to somebody and th=
at his words are 
similar to the words of Mother.

Best regards,
Narasimha

<DIV><FONT size=3D2>My guru's idea is to start four such centers in=
 east, west, north and south parts of India and then establish on=
e in Ujjain.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV><FON=
T size=3D2>The idea with each center is as following: It should be in some =
peaceful and calm place that is easily accessible by modern transportation =
and yet a little away from the hustle and bustle of modern life. There need=
 not be a big or famous temple nearby. Buy a few acres of land (for possibl=
e expansion in future) and construct a homa kundam built in open space with=
 four pillars on the four sides and a high roof on the top to protect from =
rain. The area is open on all the four sides and covered only on the top. C=
lose to it, a small one or two room structure is built to store materials.<=
/FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=3D2>A =
priest or a sadhaka is employed. His main qualification is that he should b=
e a sincere devotee of the Mother and interested in a simple lifestyle dedi=
cated to Her. His job is to do one Chandi homam in the morning, one more in=
 forenoon, have lunch, relax in the afternoon and do one more Chandi homam =
in the evening. Keep doing it day in and day out. There are no idols to wor=
ship and no other rituals to do.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=3D2></FONT>&n=
bsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=3D2>This will pretty much take up all his t=
ime and hence enough money should be arranged to take care of the priest an=
d his family. If the priest is not well-versed in homam or Chandi homam, th=
at is no problem. He can be trained. But, the most important thing is that =
he should be committed to this and devoted to the Mother. If one has the ba=
sic simplicity, innocence, devotion and purity, other things will fall=
 in place by themselves.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=3D2></FONT> </DI=
V>
<DIV><FONT size=3D2>Buying of the land and construction of room and homa=
 kundam (with roof and pillars) is a one-time expense. Salary of the priest=
 and materials like ghee, wood etc for homam are an ongoing expense. This p=
roject requires a good amount of money and energy.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=3D2>After a cente=
r is established and sadhana progresses in each center, slowly the presence=
 of Mother will be established there. Once that happens, the sadhaka will s=
tart making faster progress. As he becomes purer and purere, the sadhana wi=

<DIV><FONT size=3D2>After establishing 4 other centers, a cente=

 have a major impact on dharma in the world. That is what he was told.</FON=

<D=
IV>Namaste friends,<BR><BR>Shree Maa was referred to here. Someone sent me =
a few snippets from an <BR>interview posted on her website. Please see belo=
w.<BR><BR>It is interesting that she considers Ramakrishna Paramahamsa as h=
er guru. It <BR>is interesting that Ramakrishna told her she had to "do fir=
e ceremonies and <BR>show what is truth" and "at that time the whole world =
will be peace". This <BR>is similar to what my guru was told by Divine Moth=
er when she appeared to <BR>him during Shata Chandi homam at Chennai.<BR><B=
R>She told him that many people are and will be born who will perform a sho=
rt <BR>fire ritual on a regular basis, establish sanatana dharma and peace =
in the <BR>world and also make quick spiritual progress individually in tha=
t process. <BR>Shree Maa's statement about what Ramakrishna told her is alo=
ng similar <BR>lines.<BR><BR>My guru was also told by Mother that a few cen=
tres of regular Chandi homam <BR>should be established around the
 world, w=
here Chandi homam is done 3 times a <BR>day. These places do not need to be=
 near any temples or famous places and <BR>can be anywhere. The ritual need=
 not be elaborate. For example, there is no <BR>need to offer silk sarees e=
tc in fire. A simple ritual with bare minimum <BR>offerings is enough, but =
it needs to be performed 3 times everyday. When a <BR>few such centres are =
established, it will apparently lead to a chain of <BR>events that will hel=
p re-establish sanatana dharma.<BR><BR>Though not 3 times a day, these peop=
le have done a Chandi homam everyday for <BR>3 years in the same place and =
finished 1000 such homas. That is fantastic! <BR>It is the sadhana and puri=
ty of sadhakas that creates energy and brings <BR>deities to a place. While=
 several ancient temples are without any divine <BR>presence these days, ne=
w places of divine presence may be created by pure <BR>souls engaged in sel=
fless sadhana for establishing dharma in the
 world.<BR><BR>As I mentioned =
earlier, the sankalpa of the Shata Chandi homam during which <BR>Mother app=
eared and gave instructions to my guru on spreading homam was <BR>taken on =
Ramakrishna' s birth anniversary and the time of sankalpa was within <BR>a =
few minutes from the actual Tithi Pravesha time of the birth anniversary. <=
BR>All of this was a coincidence and we were unaware of this significance w=
hen <BR>we decided the muhurta. It is interesting to know that Ramakrishna =
did <BR>mention fire ceremonies specifically to somebody and that his words=
 are <BR>similar to the words of Mother.<BR><BR>Best regards,<BR>Narasimha<=
