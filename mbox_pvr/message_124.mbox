Dear Kumar ji,

Yes, they use only dry coconut pieces. Wood definitely produces smoke. If 
you use dry coconut pieces mainly and pour small quantities of ghee, there 
is hardly any smoke during homam. Only when the fire finally goes away can 
there be a good amount of smoke.

Imagine that you are stir-frying some vegetables in a bit of oil. If you put 
too much oil, oil will burn and produce smoke. If there isn't enough oil, 
vegetables will burn and produce smoke. If you balance vegetables and oil 
correctly, there will be no smoke and vegetables will be cooked well.

However, in the cooking analogy, you abruptly turn off fire when the 
vegetables are ready. In a homam, you cannot do that. As long as the coconut 
piecess, sesame seeds etc are burning, you keep pouring drops of ghee at the 
right places to keep it burning smoothly. It is easy to avoid smoke. But, 
once you are done, the "end game" will produce some smoke.

Instead of putting a whole or half coconut, put small dry coconut pieces. 
For example, if I put two 1.5"x1.5" pieces of dry coconut, they burn easily 
for 40 minutes. It is a good idea to start off with two or more pieces, so 
that one can help re-bring the fire in the other one if it goes away. After 
the fire is fully established, it is stable. In the beginning, when a piece 
just catches fire, the fire can go away. If there are two pieces, they can 
help each other (just as two spiritual aspirants can help each other in the 
beginning if one of them is wavering).

Best regards,
Narasimha
