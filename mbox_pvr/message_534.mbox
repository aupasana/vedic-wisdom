Namaste Madam,
 
It took a while to get to your mail. I am cc'ing the reply=
 to some yahoogroups interested in spirituality, while ensuring your anonym=
ity.
 
A lot of philosophical questions can be answered in multiple ways. T=
here is no single correct answer. The answer appropriate for one person is =
inappropriate for another. If I say "God is the doer of all things. When Ar=
juna killed his gurus and elders, actually God did it through him", a lesse=
r person may imitate it and that will be unfortunate. But that will be a ve=
ry appropriate point to make to a more elevated person who still has a sens=
e of ownership over his actions and need to give it up.
 
Thus, one cannot =
answer questions such as yours without understanding the current spiritual =
level of the asking person. Otherwise the answer will be utterly useless. I=
 will go by my gut and answer the way I think will be useful to you and som=
e others on the vedic-wisdom yahoogroup.
 
*        *        *
 
1. God cre=
ated human beings and other beings so that there is some commotion in the A=
tman (cosmic soul). If there is no different beings with different qualitie=
s, the whole universe will be filled with Atman (cosmic soul). That too hap=
pens for a while. But, at other times, various beings with various qualitie=
s are created. An ocean may be still for a while and give rise to a lot of =
waves for a while. If cosmic soul is like an ocean, various beings are like=
 waves in the ocean.
 
2. God decides based on the cumulative good/bad of a=
ll your previous actions and wishes over all your lives so far. If you have=
 good tendencies, it is because of good actions and wishes in the past. If =
you have bad tendencies, it is because of bad actions and wishes in the pas=
t. All you can do is to engage in good actions and have good wishes. That w=
ill keep you in good stead in future.
 
3. Your own free will!!!! That is w=
hy now you have to pay for it. Nature works on the principle of "equal reac=
tion to every action". You engaged in an action using your own free will an=
d nature has to somehow find a way to give the equal reaction to that actio=
n. God is there to implement the rules of nature.
 
The circumstances faced=
 by you are decides by nature based on the previous actions exerted by your=
 free will. Within the limitations imposed by those circumstances, your fre=
e will decides one particular action among several possible actions. That g=
ets added to the list of your actions and nature pays back for it in future=
 by creating different circumstances for you to operate under.
 
4. There i=
s a duality and singularity. In the world of singularity, there is one god =
- the cosmic being. Gods and demons, good and bad, auspiciousness and inaus=
piciousness, intelligence and foolishness, happiness and sadness, knowledge=
 and ignorance, punya and sin - all are nothing but this singular god. Ther=
e is nothing but that singular god. That singular god lives in all of us, i=
n each molecule, atom and sub-atomic particle of this universe. The entire =
core of our being is filled with this singular god.
 
When the same world i=
s seen through the lense of duality, this singular god manifests as differe=
nt entities. In the world of duality, there are various gods engaged in var=
ious good roles and various demons engaged in various bad roles. There is a=
lways a tussle between them.
 
Now again, all these gods and demons engaged=
 in various good and bad roles exist within us in a microcosmic form. The B=
rihaspati (teacher of gods) within us (i.e. our intelligence and discretion=
) tells the gods within us (various good qualities) what to do and works fo=
r their victory. Various gods and demons discharge their roles. But the res=
ult varies.
 
If a person's spiritual evolution is like that of the world w=
hen Ravana was ruling earth, then the demons inside the person will be domi=
nating over the gods and gods go into hiding within that person. He will en=
gage in sins. If a person's spiritual evolution is like that of the world w=
hen Rama killed Ravana and ruled earth in peace and prosperity, then the go=
ds inside that person will be dominating over the demons. Ge will engage in=
 good deeds. And so on.
 
So, realize that there are gods and demons inside=
 us and there is a constant tussle between them. The good thing is that god=
s are amara, i.e. immortal. They can be weak and defeated, but they never c=
ompletely die. Demons can die, gods can never die. They may be defeated, bu=
t they live on and overcome demons oneday!
 
If someone tells you "there is=
 only one god and he is in all of us", realize that this refers to the sing=
ular god I described earlier. With that god, there is no distinction betwee=
n good and bad. The distinction comes with gods of duality. The moment you =
talk of duality, gods and demons are both there and there is a tussle.
 
5.=
 God is simply doing his job. Nature is based on the rule of equal reaction=
 to one's actions and God impassionately implements that rule. If one was r=
eally cruel to somebody else and killed cruelly, nature will have to find a=
 way to give an equal reaction. It is sad, but that is how nature works!
 
=
6. The previous karmas and rinas to various people decide the give and take=
 in this life. The relations in this life may be relations in the past life=
 too (but the exact relationship may be different). If you harassed a parti=
cular person in the last life, nature may provide an opportunity for that p=
erson to harass you now.
 
Again, if nature is placing you in a difficult c=
ircumstance where someone is harassing you and making life difficult, it is=
 not because nature hates you or god hates you. It is because you did exact=
ly the same thing to someone else previously. Nature is paying back.
 
The =
goal of this "pay back game" of nature is that after a big cycle of actions=
 and equal reactions, one understands how nature works and manages to leave=
 the game! When all the players leave the game, the game will end. Until th=
en, the game will go on...
 
7. As more and more people engage in more and =
more sinful behavior, this creates of a spiral of adharma. That increases t=
he negative quality of time in general and leads to more and more people en=
gaging in adharma. It is a spiral.
 
Unfortunately, we are in Kali yuga and=
 adharma will only increase in the long run. But, by engaging in good actio=
ns of great magnitude, we can create positive energy and slow down this spi=
ral of adharma.
 
*        *        *
 
It is good that you worry about tho=
se who suffer. That compassion is great. But that compassion alone is not s=
ufficient. Instead, if you and others engage in good actions and create a p=
ositive energy of great magnitude in the world, that can be helpful. If ten=
 thousand people are performing a homam every morning, trying to transform =
their attitude to that of surrender to god and limited ego, that can really=
 transform the world atleast for a few decades and centuries.
 
Do homam, d=
o meditation, read good books, have good company, discuss spiritual matters=
 (instead of wasting time on meaningless entertainment), think of god, try =
to understand the ways of god, lessen pride and ego, try to do your best in=
 each action without much attachment, analyze each of your own actions and =
correct the internal attitude. If you keep up like this and several others =
do, the problems you mentioned can see some relief.
 
Best regards,
Narasim=
ha

  Dear =
sir,

  This is <deleted> from <deleted>. I came to know about you from my =
husband <deleted>.
  He has told about you a lot and i have read your mails=
 ..ganapathi homam, 
  vedic explanations etc.,

  I wish you will help me =
to have clear ideas about some of my basic questions.
  Always I ask some q=
uestions to myself.Even myself and my husband will discuss
  regarding this=
. But we both unable to find out the answer. They are,

  1. My first quest=
ion is why God created human beings?

  2. When God is creating all the hum=
an beings,we are all God's children.
  Then why he is differntiating some p=
eople are good, some are bad? On what basis he
  is deciding that "this per=
son will have good habits in his life time and that person will have
  all =
bad habits? "

  3.Some of the astrologers say to me, whatever problems/suf=
ferings etc., we are facing in
  this life time is due to our previous karm=
a.ie.,we have done some sin to others in our 
  previous birth.Who induced =
us to do sin in our previous birth to others?

  4. Some people say, God is=
 inside us. When God is inside us, why people are doing sin to 
  others? I=
f they are doing, why God is not correcting them??

  5.Nowadays, they are =
so many accidents happening in the city. Painful deaths are
  happening whi=
ch cannot be digested / make us sleepless for nights together. Why God 
  i=
s giving these type of painful death to people? why he is so cruel?People s=
ay the person 
  who died might have made sin to others in last birth. For =
that, this kind of cruelty is required?
  Why God is not giving peaceful de=
ath??

  6. My another question is regarding family issues. Most of the dau=
ghter-in-law suffer becos
  of her Mother-in-law/Father-in-law/Sister-in-la=
w and Husbands or vice versa. I have come across
  so many families like th=
is.If daughter in law is tortured from her husband's family, is it due
  to=
 her horoscope or due to society. If it is due to her horoscope, its the sa=
me answer that 
  its her karma. Why her karma is written like that? why sh=
e should suffer in her life?? Who has
  made her to suffer like this(even i=
f she is of good character/good habits)??

  7. Nowadays, it is becoming ve=
ry unsafe for ladies in the society. Some girls are getting 
  exploited an=
d some knowingly going in the wrong way making a mind set that nothing is 
=
  wrong. Why society has developed like this??When God has created the worl=
d, why he is 
  allowing it to go worse? What will be the future of the you=
ngsters? whether we can bring 
  up our children with good habits? I feel i=
ts very difficult..All these things related to astrology?

  Kindly bear wi=
th my long mail and guide me.

  Thanks/Regards,
  <deleted>

>1. My first question is why God created human beings?</DIV>
  <DIV><FONT f=
ace=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
  <DIV>2. When God is creating all=
 the human beings,we are all God's 
  children.<BR>Then why he is differnti=
ating some people are good, some are bad? 
  On what basis he<BR>is decidin=
g that "this person will have good habits in his 
  life time and that pers=
on will have<BR>all bad habits? "</DIV>
  <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>=
</FONT> </DIV>
  <DIV>3.Some of the astrologers say to me, whatever pr=
oblems/sufferings etc., 
  we are facing in<BR>this life time is due to our=
 previous karma.ie.,we have 
  done some sin to others in our <BR>previous =
birth.Who induced us to do sin in 
  our previous birth to others?</DIV>
  =
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
  <DIV>4. Some people =
say, God is inside us. When God is inside us, why people 
  are doing sin t=
o <BR>others? If they are doing, why God is not correcting 
  them??</DIV>
=
  <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
  <DIV>5.Nowadays, t=
hey are so many accidents happening in the city. Painful 
  deaths are<BR>h=
appening which cannot be digested / make us sleepless for 
  nights togethe=
r. Why God <BR>is giving these type of painful death to people? 
  why he i=
s so cruel?People say the person <BR>who died might have made sin to 
  oth=
ers in last birth. For that, this kind of cruelty is required?<BR>Why God 
=
  is not giving peaceful death??</DIV>
  <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2><=
/FONT> </DIV>
  <DIV>6. My another question is regarding family issues=
. Most of the 
  daughter-in-law suffer becos<BR>of her 
  Mother-in-law/Fa=
ther-in-law/Sister-in-law and Husbands or vice versa. I have 
  come across=
<BR>so many families like this.If daughter in law is tortured from 
  her h=
usband's family, is it due<BR>to her horoscope or due to society. If it 
  =
is due to her horoscope, its the same answer that <BR>its her karma. Why he=
r 
  karma is written like that? why she should suffer in her life?? Who 
 =
 has<BR>made her to suffer like this(even if she is of good character/good =

  habits)??</DIV>
  <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
 =
 <DIV>7. Nowadays, it is becoming very unsafe for ladies in the society. So=
me 
  girls are getting <BR>exploited and some knowingly going in the wrong=
 way 
  making a mind set that nothing is <BR>wrong. Why society has develo=
ped like 
  this??When God has created the world, why he is <BR>allowing it=
 to go worse? 
  What will be the future of the youngsters? whether we can =
bring <BR>up our 
  children with good habits? I feel its very difficult..A=
ll these things related 
  to astrology?</DIV>
