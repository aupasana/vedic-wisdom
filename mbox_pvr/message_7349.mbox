Namaste friends,

Mahaganapathi homam manual is now available in Romanian language as a 
free PDF download, thanks to the kind efforts of Eugen Niculescu 
(Arunachaleshwara). If you are interested, please go to:

http://stiintaindieiantice.wordpress.com/about/mahaganapathi/

I will link it to the main homam page soon.

*        *        *

Just a word on spreading homam: Inspire, tell and enable as many people 
as you can, to do homam. But do not have any expectations. Don't worry 
about how many people taught/enabled by you end up doing homam. Telling 
people about homam is in your hands, but whether they actually do it or 
not is NOT in your hands. A good yogi does good karmas that are in one's 
hand to the best of one's ability, but does not think about thinks not 
in one's hands.

Best regards,
Narasimha
