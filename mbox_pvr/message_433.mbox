Dear Narasimhaji
=C2=A0
I had a question about Rishis. In the Aghora books=
, it is mentioned that the Rishis of yesteryears are still alive and roam a=
round in this planet. There are signs on their body.And that only some who =
has done terrific amount of tapashya is eligible to meet a Rishi. And also =
that praying to Rishi of ones gotra can help to acclerate ones spirtual pro=
gress. Kindly enlighten us with your thoughts on this topic. I am really cu=
rious..
=C2=A0
Thanks in advance.
=C2=A0
-Regards

Dear Prasad,
=C2=A0
I do not know any specific mantra=
. I know many mantras for which Kashyapa is rishi, but no mantra to pray to=
 Kashyapa himself.
=C2=A0
There are many mantras for Prajapati in general (=
"prajaapate na tvadetaanyanyo. .."), but I don't know a mantra specifically=
 to worship Kashyapa.
=C2=A0
If you perform a homam, you can add the follow=
ing line after the poorvaangam (initial five aahutis) and before the uttara=
ngam.
=C2=A0
Om kashyapaaya swaahaa. kashyapaayedam na mama.
=C2=A0
Say it =
and make an offering of=C2=A0ghee for Kashyapa.
=C2=A0
Another way to worsh=
ip a rishi is to take section of Veda for which he is the rishi and try to =
experience that section. You can simply pick one rik for which Kashyapa is =
rishi and keep meditating on that rik. You can close your eyes, keep back s=
traight and repeat the rik mentally with swaram without moving and do that =
everyday for a certain amount of time. Oneday the rishi may be pleased with=
 you and you may experience something.
=C2=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha
