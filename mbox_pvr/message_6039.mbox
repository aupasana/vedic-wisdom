Namaste,

Analyzing the cause-effect relationship between various happenings is 
not easy, especially when there is a variable time lag between cause and 
effect.

There was also a tsunami that affected south India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia 
etc 5 years back. There were devastating earthquakes in Haiti and Chile 
last year and in Pakistan and China 2-3 years back. There were historic 
floods that did huge long-term damage to fertile lands in Pakistan. 
Volcano in Iceland caused a lot of damage to world economy that was 
already bad. It is difficult to find a common factor (like whaling) to 
all these places.

Japanese are inherently hard-working and detached people. As a 
community, there is no other community in the world that is a better 
example of "nishkama karma yoga" than Japanese and Korean people. 
However, Japanese may have done their share of bad karmas during the 
last few centuries or so. It is tough to say which event is caused by 
their atrocities against other Asian countries (e.g. China) during World 
War II and which event is caused by something else. Why even try?

*        *        *

I am afraid huge natural disasters may continue to bother the 
inhabitants of earth in the next several years, until the geo-political 
equilibrium and the lifestyle of human beings change in such a way that 
we earthlings stop moving in the disastrous direction we have been 
heading in for a few decades now. These changes will be bad for some, 
but ok for some and good for some others.

Economists talked about the stock market bubble, real estate bubble etc 
during 1990s and 2000s. But the real bubble behind all of them is what I 
call the "consumption bubble", i.e. the culture of relying on 
ever-increasing consumption of goods. We rely on people buying new 
phones, new cell phones, new TVs, new computers etc every few years, 
whether they need or not. We increase their reliance on them and count 
on an ever-increasing consumption so that companies do well, people get 
more money and they can consume more. This bubble is unsustainable and 
disastrous for Mother Earth. This bubble has been slowly trying to burst 
for a few years now. This will completely burst and a new sustainable 
lifestyle/philosophy will replace our current mindset.

*        *        *

What is happening now and will happen in near future has been triggered 
irreversibly by our own past actions. But some future events are still 
in our hands. If, though our spiritual sadhana and through our actions 
in the material world, we increase dharma and responsible/unselfish 
behavior in the world, it will impact future events.

Best regards,
Narasimha
