Dear Narasimha,

In the discussion that happened, here is my stand, in case=
 you have not 
understood the same properly:

1) He was something special -=
 which I cannot judge - because Manish says so, and 
on THIS point I trust =
Manish's judgement more than your or mine.

2) Some siddhis=C2=A0as you not=
ed are special. Only very higher level beings can 
attain the same. Since t=
he topic of siddhis did come up, Vimalananda's ability 
to suck up a ton of=
 mercury by Vajroli and bring it out from his hair infront of 
someone of V=
ishudhananda's=C2=A0spiritual calibre, is not a easy feat.=C2=A0This is not=
 a 
run-of-the-mill siddhi.

3) I never compared Vimalananda with Ramakrish=
na, but with Ramakrishna's 
disciples. That is a crucial difference.=C2=A0=
=C2=A0My comparisons are=C2=A0always based NOT on 
my understanding, but cl=
ear words of great spiritual people.=C2=A0That is why=C2=A0I am 
100 perece=
nt clear that Ramakrishna is spiritually higher than a Vivekananada or 
an =
Abhedananda. You may not want to judge them., thats your point of view. I o=
n 
the other hand would rather rely on the clear words of Vivekananda and 
=
Abhedananda on this matter rather than speculation. Both Vivekananda and 
A=
bhedananda used to say Ramakrishna is their Guru and spiritually far higher=
 
than they were.

4) Whether Ramakrishna was a paramhamsa or a siddha in=
=C2=A0Vimalananda's scale is 
merely your speculation. Vimalananda's books =
however betray no such speculation. 
I would rather rely on the words of th=
e book.

5)=C2=A0In this age everyone likes to take a=C2=A0title for himsel=
f. Many spiritual people 
name themselves Rishis, and we know it they are n=
ot.=C2=A0 So the Nityananda 
comparison does not stand. Vimalananda on his =
part never used any titles, not 
even the term Guru. I base my=C2=A0judgeme=
nt of this man on a) critical study of the 
books b) Manish's words. And I =
have not found you giving any sound logic=C2=A0for why 
I should change the=
 same.

6) If you do not want to compare spiritual people, that is perfectl=
y fine. I or 
anyone else is not forcing you.=C2=A0However, that does not m=
ean the world will=C2=A0not 
do so, specially when the great=C2=A0spiritual=
 people themselves have=C2=A0clearly done so 
on different occassions. Vive=
kananda says Ramakrishna=C2=A0a greater spiritual man. I 
take his words as=
 true. Period.

Dear All,

This is hardly a matter of=C2=A0parochialism. Pl=
ease do not unnecessarily 
complicate=C2=A0a simple discussion. I think=C2=
=A0the discussion has been misunderstood. 
Either=C2=A0go ontu Twitter and =
read the whole discussion point by point, or simple 
ignore it and keep doi=
ng your own stuff.=C2=A0

-Regards
=C2=A0Rajarshi

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] On Siddhis & Spiritual Progress

=C2=A0 
Namaste f=
riends,
=C2=A0
This is a small writeup on "siddhis" vis-a-vis spiritual pro=
gress, in reaction 
to further exchanges on Twitter. This is a delicate are=
a where many have 
misconceptions and I will try to address them.
=C2=A0
*=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Maharshi Vasishtha's teaching to Lord Rama is clear i=
n Yoga Vaasishtham. The 
goal of existence and sadhana is self-realization.=
 Siddhis are to be neither 
specifically sought nor specifically avoided, b=
y a seeker of Self. If Nature 
gives one some siddhi(s), one should accept =
them with neither excitement nor 
disappointment. But one should NOT run af=
ter them, for they are neither 
necessary nor sufficient for self-realizati=
on and liberation.
=C2=A0
Vivekananda used the same principle when Ramakiri=
shna proposed to give his 
siddhis to Vivekananda. He asked whether the sid=
dhis will enable him to realize 
god. Ramakrishna said no. Vivekananda firm=
ly declined the offer then! Of course, 
when Ramakrishna gave them anyway l=
ater, he accepted them. Vivekananda's two 
actions demonstrate Vasishtha's =
instructions well.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Let us use the analogy of =
climbing a hill. Climbing hill is one's spiritual 
sadhana. Reaching the to=
p is liberation. Different people climb the hill from 
different sides and =
using different paths. There may be trees with nice fruits 
on the sides of=
 the road. They are siddhis or special abilities.
=C2=A0
If one gets distra=
cted, starts climbing the trees and collecting fruits, one's 
journey gets =
delayed and one may not reach the top. That is why Vasishtha says a 
seeker=
 of Self does not pursue any siddhis.
=C2=A0
But if some fruits fall in one=
's lap by themselves, one can keep them. 
Similarly, siddhis that come to o=
ne by themselves can be accepted by a seeker of 
Self.
=C2=A0
Now an import=
ant distinction:
=C2=A0
There are some trees that are found at lower altitu=
des also, but some really 
special trees are found at very high altitudes o=
nly. If one has such a fruit, it 
shows that one has climbed great heights.=
 Similarly, some siddhis do not mean 
much, but some siddhis are very speci=
al and only really elevated sadhakas can 
obtain them (whether by trying or=
 without trying). If a sadhakas demonstrates 
such a siddhi, you can see th=
at one progressed a lot. However, the key is that 
one who climbed the same=
 or more distance may not have that or any other fruit. 

=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0 *
=C2=A0
Unlike in the example of climbing hill, which is an external a=
ctivity, spiritual 
progress in real life is *internal*. There is NO way fo=
r anyone to know for sure 
how much progress one has made, how much self-co=
ntrol one has internally and 
what exactly goes on in one's mind. We may tr=
y to judge it from external factors 
such as actions, words etc, but it is =
not necessarily accurate.
=C2=A0
Here, some people swayed by siddhis may be=
 tempted to use one's siddhis to judge 
how high one climbed. But that is f=
aulty. One person who reached the absolute 
top may not have any fruits, wh=
ile one person who still has ways to climb may 
have gotten some really nic=
e fruit. Using externaslly demonstrable siddhis that 
are neither necessary=
 nor sufficient for Self-realization as a measure of one's 
progress is uns=
ound.
=C2=A0
Given that spiritual progress is internal, how can we judge it=
 and compare 
people then? Well, we need not and should not. Only a sarvaan=
taryaami - a 
perfected being who has access to each being's internal state=
 - can do that.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Rajarshi, you are assuming th=
at Ramakrishna Paramahamsa is a Paramahamsa on 
Vimalananda's scale. You ar=
e concluding that Ramakrishna is a Paramahamsa; 
Abhedananda, Vivekananda e=
tc are lower than that; Vimalananda is a rishi; and 
hence Vimalananda is s=
uperior to Abhedananda and Vivekananda by 2pwr16 to 2.
=C2=A0
Is Paramahams=
a Nithyananda, who was caught in a sex scandal, also a Paramahamsa 
because=
 he is known so? See, how people are famously known may or may not 
reflect=
 their spiritual stature. Real spiritual stature is internal and you 
canno=
t see it.
=C2=A0
We do not know who Ramakrishna Paramahamsa really is. He m=
ay not be just a 
paramahamsa on Vimalananda's scale, but be a siddha or a =
natha or even a rishi. 
He may even be Vishnu himself, as he himself said a=
nd some religious experts of 
that time declared based on various signs. If=
 Ramakrishna Paramahamsa is Vishnu 
himself, Vivekananda, Abhedananda etc c=
an definitely be rishis or naths in 
Vimalananda's scale. If your argument =
is that they cannot be because they did 
not demonstrate siddhis compatible=
 with that status, that is a non-point as I 
explained above. The disagreem=
ent between then boils down a difference in the 
relevance and importance o=
f externally demonstrated siddhis.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Why this =
is relevant and I spent some time on this is that some people seem to 
have=
 misconceptions. The take home for some people from some books describing 
=
miracles and siddhis may be that siddhis are important.
=C2=A0
Vasishtha is=
 not only a rishi, but one of saptarshis. Please read what he taught 
Lord =
Rama in Yoga Vaasishtham. It is the essence of Veda and Upanishad. It will =

balance your views and mould your attitude. Read Yoga Vaasishtham. Siddhis=
 are 
neither necessary nor sufficient for self-realization. Don't be distr=
acted by 
them or be infatuated with them.
=C2=A0
The goal of sadhana is th=
at your notions of "this is I and these are mine" get 
subtler and subtler =
and hold of six internal enemies on you becomes weaker and 
weaker. Others =
may or may not be able to see and judge your progress, but you 
know your p=
rogress and weaknesses the best. THAT is the crux and siddhis have no 
rele=
vance or meaning. Any fascination for them will set you back in your 
sadha=
na.

s matter rather than speculation. Both Vivekananda and Abhedananda used to =
say Ramakrishna is their Guru and spiritually far higher than they were.</D=
IV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>4) Whether Ramakrishna was a paramhamsa or a sid=
dha in Vimalananda's scale is merely your speculation. Vimalananda's b=
ooks however betray no such speculation. I would rather rely on the words o=
f the book.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>5) In this age everyone likes=
 to take a title for himself. Many spiritual people name themselves Ri=
shis, and we know it they are not.  So the Nityananda comparison does =
not stand. Vimalananda on his part never used any titles, not even the term=
 Guru. I base my judgement of this man on a) critical study of the boo=
ks b) Manish's words. And I have not found you giving any sound logic =
for why I should change the same.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>6) If you do=
 not want to compare spiritual people, that is perfectly fine. I or anyone =
else is not forcing you. However, that does not mean the world will&nb=
sp;not do so, specially when the great spiritual people themselves hav=
e clearly done so on different occassions. Vivekananda says Ramakrishn=
a a greater spiritual man. I take his words as true. Period.</DIV>

We do not know who Ramakrishna Paramahamsa really is. He may not be just a =
paramahamsa on Vimalananda's scale, but be a siddha or a natha or even a ri=
shi. He may even be Vishnu himself, as he himself said and some religious e=
xperts of that time declared based on various signs. If Ramakrishna Paramah=
amsa is Vishnu himself, Vivekananda, Abhedananda etc can definitely be rish=
is or naths in Vimalananda's scale. If your argument is that they cannot be=
 because they did not demonstrate siddhis compatible with that status, that=
 is a non-point as I explained above. The disagreement between then boils d=
own a difference in the relevance and importance of externally demonstrated=
 siddhis.</FONT></DIV>
