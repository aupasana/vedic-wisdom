Namaste,

Yes, it is advisable to follow sutak. One is doing it for oneself and not 
for the deceased person. Irrespective of the beliefs of the deceased person, 
his rinas (debts) with one will continue to affect one's consciousness and 
need to be taken care of. One should follow sanatana dharma for oneself in 
such a case.

Also, when doing rites such as pitri tarpana, one should not think that one 
is helping or benefiting a deceased person. One should think that one is 
helping oneself by freeing one from the kaarmik debts to the deceased 
person.

Best regards,
Narasimha
