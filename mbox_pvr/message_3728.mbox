m question

=C2=A0 
Namaste,

Some qucik points:

(1) If you think of your =
wish in your mind in your mother tongue when taking sankalpa formally, I am=
 sure gods will understand and respond.

(2) If you want to formally add it=
 to sankalpa given in homam manuals, please add the following after "prasaa=
da siddhyartham" : "G gotrodbhavaayaaH N nakShatre R raashau L lagne jaataa=
yaaH X naamnyaaH aayurvR^iddhyartham aarogyatA siddhyartham" (in iTrans not=
ation). Here G is her gotra, N is nakshatra, R is janma raashi, L is lagna =
and X is the name.

(3) Homam to Shiva using the Maha Mrityunjaya mantra is=
 ideal for this purpose, though you can really do any homam you want. One s=
pecific offering is mentioned. Make paayasam (cook rice in milk and ghee, i=
.e. clarified butter, and add jaggery). Offer darbhas (sacred dry grass) di=
pped in paayasam with each repetition of the mantra, if possible.

(4) The =
instinct to help someone else and reduce someone else's suffering is a very=
 noble and useful one.

However, it is not without its costs. Basically rem=
ember that the world runs based on actions and reactions. Any suffering som=
eone is experiencing is a reaction to a previous action committed by that p=
erson. If you want to take it on yourself, you will either have to experien=
ce the reaction or burn the karma (action) though sadhana, i.e. convert the=
 reaction into something else using some energy.

Of course, taking on some=
one else's suffering and suffering oneself is not easy. So what you are rea=
lly trying to do is to burn the karma using the energy created by a focused=
 sadhana such as homam or japam. This is akin to someone throwing a ball at=
 a wall and the ball coming at that person fast later and you trying to bur=
n it on the way (using some energy such as heat).

The problem is that your=
 sadhana may not succeed in perfectly avoiding the reaction. In other words=
, the ball that bounced back may not be reduced to ashes fully and some sma=
ll pieces of the ball may still come and hit that person (or you on his/her=
 behalf). Not being rishis, we cannot perfectly control the dynamics. Think=
 for a moment if you are fine with taking a bit of suffering if needed, as =
a result of avoiding a major catastrophe for that person.

(5) Some learned=
 Adwaitis may correctly say, "all is Brahman. Life and death is the same. A=
atman is neither born nor does it die. What is there to worry if someone is=
 suffering or close to death?"

However, that is a wrong approach. Both dua=
lity and non-duality are valid and true. It is easy to sit on the bank and =
tell someone drowning in the ocean, "you are ocean are the same. Do not wor=
ry". If one is really at a stage where one can think like that even when on=
e is drowning in ocean and not worry, THEN one is a true adwaita jnaani. Ot=
herwise, it is just bookish knowledge and means nothing.

Because the world=
 has so many people stuck in the duality (good vs bad, happy vs sad, beauti=
ful vs ugly etc polarities), rishis have given knowledge that helps one swi=
m the ocean of polarities and ultimately realize Self. Merely stating that =
all is Brahman may not help anybody realize that. Until one realizes that, =
one needs tools to navigate the ocean of duality.

Let me put it this way: =
When YOU find yourself in various situations that cause pleasure and pain, =
try to think like an Adwaiti and remind yourself that all is Brahman. When =
you are dealing with someone else who is in great pain, forget adwaita and =
try to identify with that person and feel the person's pain. That will not =
do any harm to your spiritual progress.

Best regards,
Narasimha
