Namaste friends,
=C2=A0
Someone with psychiatric problems may expereience w=
hat sounds like a Kundalini rise, but it may or may not be one.
=C2=A0
It m=
ust be conceded though that Kundalini spontaneously rising through various =
nadis without one having gone through proper preparation in this life (i.e.=
 fine-tuning of one's attitude and development of detachment) CAN create ha=
voc!
=C2=A0
One may wonder how Kundalini may spontaneously rise in a layman=
 with no sadhana, while many serious sadhakas may not experience it.
=C2=A0=

Firstly, Kundalini rise is NOT an achievement. It is just A SMALL STEP in =
overcoming one's current limited identity.
=C2=A0
Let me give an analogy. O=
ne wanting to move from one's small dilapidated house (this
 body-mind comp=
lex) to a huge palace (realized Self) may first construct the palace over t=
ime and move into it when it is COMPLETE. Alternately, if one occasionally =
goes and stays in the palace still under construction (analogy for out of b=
ody experiences due to Kundalini rise), is it an achievement? In fact, it c=
omes with risks. The former approach is safer and one loses nothing in it. =
Similarly, one can progress towards complete Self-realization without any o=
ut of body experiences. These are not my word's, but Maharshi Vasishtha's w=
ords to Lord Rama.
=C2=A0
Secondly, one does not get something without want=
ing it and putting sufficient effort towards it. One may have deeply desire=
d a Kundalini rise in a previous life and may have put enough effort. As a =
result, one may be getting it now. But one may be unprepared (and ironicall=
y may not even want it!) when it comes in this life.
=C2=A0
As you do sadha=
na, try not to fancy too many specific desires. Nature has a delay mechanis=
m in granting your desires (because of constraints on what Nature can give =
you right now, arising from YOUR
 OWN previous actions). So Nature sometime=
s gives you what you want LATE, when you no longer want it or want somethin=
g else. For example, one may pray for great wealth one's whole life and be =
born as a rich but very sick man in next life. One may not enjoy that wealt=
h and pray whole life for health. In the life after that, one may be very h=
ealthy, but not have any knowledge or money. In another 
case, one may deep=
ly desire to act in a famous film. One may be reborn 
as a tiger or a dog a=
nd act in a famous film, but not really enjoy that 
experience. Basically, =
people keep going in circles through various lives, always "seeking" someth=
ing they are "missing".
=C2=A0
Anyway, coming back to Kundalini, if one dee=
ply desires an out of body experience given by a rising Kundalini and one's=
 previous karmas constrain one from having it in THIS life, one may be born=
 in next life with this specific desire destined to fructify (if there is e=
nough karmik force behind it).

 *
=C2=A0
Kundalini rise=
 is not necessarily scary or painful, if one is well-prepared in terms of a=
ttitude and detachment.
=C2=A0
Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap.=
 I went to free it and it panicked so badly and started to shake violently.=
 I went to save it from a certain slow death and it was scared that I would=
 kill it!
=C2=A0
We are like that chipmunk, glued to the mouse trap called =
this body-mind complex and scared of being rescued from a certain slow deat=
h!
=C2=A0
If our ideas about who we are (viz this current body-mind complex=
) are incorrect and if we are this "infinite Self" as shastras say, won't a=
 complete realization of that at some stage involve stepping out of this bo=
dy-mind complex, without being scared?

=C2=A0
Kundal=
ini rise after most undesirable conditioning is overcome, is far better tha=
n Kundalini rise forced when some really undesirable conditioning is still =
left in one's system.
=C2=A0
When one transcends one problematic notion abo=
ut who one is and what one needs, another notion that lay buried deeper in =
consciousness may spring to the surface and torment one. If one overcomes t=
he notion "I am the body", there may be another notion in one's body-mind c=
omplex that one's awareness clings on to (e.g. a great doctor, a great lead=
er, a great scholar, a great saint etc). As an extreme example, if one pers=
on had a hidden deep desire to be a great soul who rescues the world, he ma=
y fancy that he is a re-incarnated X or Y who will rescue the world now. Wh=
en one's self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!) deeply clings to any such notion,=
 it can cause havoc. The person may show some signs of progress and yet rem=
ain in ignorance and get stuck badly.
=C2=A0
An awakened Kundalini in a sys=
tem with undesirable conditioning may accentuate one's weaknesses and wrong=
 notions heavily and cause serious psychiatric and spiritual problems.
=C2=

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
The best approach I recommend is to NOT think i=
n terms of Kundalini and its rise. Just do sadhana, overcome your
 weakness=
es and improve your detachment over time. Again, I want to emphasize that d=
etachment is not disgust or distaste for life/things/people around you. Dis=
gust is the other side of coin of attachment. It is a negative attachment.
=
=C2=A0

Don't worry about 
whether your Kundalini rises or not. Worry about=
 whether you are able to resist 6 internal enemies (shadripus) and 8 bondag=
es (ashta pashas) or 
not. If your ability to resist them is increasing, yo=
u are making progress. EVEN IF your Kundalini is fast asleep, you are still=
 making progress. When you completely overcome them, Kundalini (your self-a=
wareness) 
will automatically ascend to the top and meet Her Lord (true Sel=
f).
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
One word on surrendering to a personal de=
ity. Though true surrender is helpful, most people do not have it. They sim=
ply do business with god. Though people may be offended by my words, this i=
s the plain and bare fact.
=C2=A0
"I want X, I will pray to you and please =
give it to me", "I am scared of Kundalini rise, I will pray to you and plea=
se protect me" - all this is just a business deal. There is something you w=
ant and you ask god for it. True surrender has no place for agendas, desire=
s, demands or expectations. True surrender is losing oneself in one's fasci=
nation for the qualities of Lord. True surrender is accepting anything Lord=
 throws one's way (whether it is pleasurable or highly painful) as Lord's p=
rasad and accepting it gratefully. True surrender is thinking of Lord with =
fascination and pleasure, even in the face of (and during) Death.
=C2=A0
If=
 one without true surrender and with many desires and wrong notions experie=
nces a Kundalini rise, one may still be trapped, despite thinking of a pers=
onal god. It is not that god does not want to "protect" one as said below. =
It is not about protecting or endangering. If you go back to my "chipmunk g=
lued to mouse trap" example above, I was trying to protect it, but it was s=
cared. Similarly, one's conditioning makes one *run away* from God's protec=
tion! God's protection may seem to a conditioned mind like grave danger tha=
t one should run away from!
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Whether through th=
e path of wisdom or surrender, develop dispassion and detachment. Realize t=
hat all this is temporary and can be taken away anytime. Enjoy it while you=
 have and keep doing your best, but be prepared to lose everything anytime.=
 Only detachment and a very light mental conditioning (very light desires, =
dislikes etc) can protect one as one's Kundalini rises to meet True Self. H=
eavy conditioning and impurities in one's nadis will distract rising Kundal=
ini (self-awareness) and stop Her from meeting True Self.
=C2=A0
The real k=
ey is how light your conditioning is.
=C2=A0

Narasimha

>>In Tantra, t=
o focus on Kundalini, one needs a few things going. 1 - Bhuta Suddhi. Const=
ant efforts of purification of the various elements that compose the human =
mind-body structure. In simpler words this translates into more detachment,=
 more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, greed etc =
etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, one has to now =
self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a far more in=
tense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 - A good g=
uru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really does - it ca=
n also open up the mind and body to various other things and entities, some=
 of which are not postive in nature while some of them are useless, and giv=
en half a chance can make use of the individual for its own ends. They take=
 hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and miss-utilizes the s=
ame. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more
 vital. 4 - While someda=
y or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini Shakti aweken=
ing and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are because of this. The =
human psychology as understood by west today is puerile and insufficient to=
 deal with various things. It is also possible sometimes that the aura of a=
n individual, which protects us from various subtle influences and helps us=
 to remain as functional entities, can get "ruptured" due to various reason=
s, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can allow fr=
ee assess of various entities inside the mind and they have chances of caus=
ing serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and various possiblitie=
s are there, it is not possible to list down every option. Moreover, even i=
f such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few can have the right knowledge=
 to rectify the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are often doing n=
othing more than an intelligent guess work.
 Sometimes it will have results=
, sometimes not. For all these to be achieved, the starting point is a soun=
d mind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used to say - Mens sana in co=
rpore sano. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi

>>Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of=
 kundalini syndrome based on my recent experience of a patient of mine. I a=
m doing a psychiatry job at present, and have been involved in the care of =
someone who seems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening of their kun=
dalini since childhood. This has involved out-of-body experiences and surge=
s of energy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of=
 kundalini until her symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. =
We have not been able to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests=
 normal)- so it might be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many peopl=
e we call mentally ill describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or=
 unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest and =
research into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these pati=
ents are not well-understood by western medicine, and as we have no treatme=
nts for deranged kundalini,
 we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to fo=
rcibly waken the kundalini. My experience with this lady confirmed my feeli=
ng that kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill =
herself at times because the suffering from the deranged energy is so bad. =
She feels it will consume her, and it is something she cannot escape from. =
I wondered what solution there could be to her problem. The logical one was=
 to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve th=
e suffering of this woman- and either cure her, or give her the strength to=
 bear this. May I request that the good samaritans among you pray for her, =
and for others like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really i=
s pitiable. And let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in thi=
s situation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. =
It is perhaps safest to say "let me be your instrument" and leave the kunda=
lini rising bit to
 God's will. Om Dum Durgayai Namaha Aparna

000;FONT-SIZE:12pt;">In Tantra, to focus on Kundalini, one needs a few thin=
gs going. 1 - Bhuta Suddhi. Constant efforts of purification of the various=
 elements that compose the human mind-body structure. In simpler words this=
 translates into more detachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, c=
ontrol of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini a=
wakening happens, one has to now self identify with the Devata with greater=
 force. Devotion of a far more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes =
care of the journey. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - I=
F and when it really does - it can also open up the mind and body to variou=
s other things and entities, some of which are not postive in nature while =
some of them are useless, and given half a chance can make use
 of the
 ind=
ividual
 for its own ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness in characte=
r and nature and miss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi become=
s even more vital. 4 - While someday or other every sadhaka will have an ex=
perience of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of p=
sychology are because of this. The human psychology as understood by west t=
oday is puerile and insufficient to deal with various things. It is also po=
ssible sometimes that the aura of an individual, which protects us from var=
ious subtle influences and helps us to remain as functional entities, can g=
et "ruptured" due to various reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifest=
yles, trauma etc. That can allow free assess of various entities inside the=
 mind and they have chances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are v=
ery complex and various possiblities are there, it is not possible to list =
down every option. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly
 done, v=
ery few can have the right knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who cla=
im they can do so, are often doing nothing more than an intelligent guess w=
ork. Sometimes it will have results, sometimes not. For all these to be ach=
ieved, the starting point is a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient G=

<div>Dear all, Just wanted to warn people =
of kundalini syndrome based on my recent experience of a patient of mine. I=
 am doing a psychiatry job at present, and have been involved in the care o=
f someone who seems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening of their k=
undalini since childhood. This has involved out-of-body experiences and sur=
ges of energy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard =
of kundalini until her symptoms started and she searched for an explanation=
. We have not been able to find anything physically wrong with her (all tes=
ts normal)- so it might be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many peo=
ple we call mentally ill describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, =
or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest an=
d research into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these pa=
tients are not well-understood by western medicine, and as we have no treat=
ments
 for deranged kundalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to =
forcibly waken the kundalini. My experience with this lady confirmed my fee=
ling that kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kil=
l herself at times because the suffering from the deranged energy is so bad=
. She feels it will consume her, and it is something she cannot escape from=
. I wondered what solution there could be to her problem. The logical one w=
as to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve =
the suffering of this woman- and either cure her, or give her the strength =
to bear this. May I request that the good samaritans among you pray for her=
, and for others like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really=
 is pitiable. And let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in t=
his situation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest=
. It is perhaps safest to say "let me be your
 instrument" and leave the ku=
ndalini rising bit to God's will. Om Dum Durgayai Namaha Aparna </div></div=
