Namaste,
 
1. This is a common notion that several priests have. It is nice and sweet of them to be concerned about prodding the deities. But let me pose it differently. Suppose a guest in your house is stuck under a sofa and a chair and suffocated. Do you leave him alone or do you move the sofa and chair so that he can move out?
 
Some minimal movement of contents using tongs to ensure better supply of air around the materials so that Fire can devour all offerings is perfectly acceptable. Without it, Fire may find it difficult to consume all.
 
2. Several shlokas from Saptashati itself or Saptashloki or Kavacha or Argala are used. Though it is not given anywhere, I intuitively feel that "sreeraama raama raameti" shloka will be good. Another idea is using "om aim" for first part, "om hreem" for the middle part and "om kleem" for the final part. Or you can use "om aim hreem kleem" for all.
 
3. People repeat the full shloka 3 times instead, instead of breaking at each namastasyai.
 
4. If you use a shloka, once between each two shlokas is enough. If you use beejas, use them like this:
 
Example: om aim <shloka 1> aim om, om aim <shloka 2> aim om and so on.
 
5. These differences suggest that the guidelines are arbitrary. I do not offer specific substances for each chapter, but I offer specific substances for a few specific shlokas. For example, "madhu yaavat pibaamyaham" comes in the 3rd chapter and I offer jaggery. Some offer honey. For "sarva maMgaLa maaMgaLye" in the 11th chapter, I offer dry turmeric pieces that are normally used in maMgaLya. For "daaDimI kusumopamaaH" in 11th chapter, I offer pomegranate seeds. Like that, some specific substances based on the meanings of verses are possible.
 
But, my general guideline is to not worry about too many technicalities.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
