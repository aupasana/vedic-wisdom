Namaste Sri,
 
When one is struggling, praying to god with material desires=
 is natural. It is of no use for me or anyone to tell you want to do, sitti=
ng on the sidelines. You will have to find your bearings yourself and chart=
 your course. But my 2 cents of comments on some specific points you covere=
d.
 
First, atheism vs theism is not really the crux here. God is not an eg=
oist who wants people to like him and praise him. Atheism was a valid path =
to god within Sanatana Dharma, though the path taken by most atheists today=
 does not lead to god.
 
As long as one is attracted to some things and rep=
elled by some things, one will keep running after some things and keep runn=
ing from some things. This run gives pleasure at times and pain at times an=
d one fluctuates between them. Until one achieves samadrishti (equal vision=
), where nothing is attractive and repulsive, one will keep running. Achiev=
ing sama drishti does not happen in a day and takes a long time.
 
It is po=
ssible to be an atheist who does not believe in god and yet view the whole =
universe as arbitrary and not be swayed by attractions and repulsions. It i=
s possible to be a theist who does many rituals and prayers to god and yet =
remains swayed by thousands of desires, attractions and repulsions.
 
Secon=
dly, whatever we experience is an equal reaction (result) to some action we=
 ourselves performed earlier (in the same life or a previous life). Because=
 there is a time gap between actions and results and because we do not reme=
mber some past actions, we are unable to associate the results with actions=
. But, nothing happens to one unless one's own actions gave a chance/sancti=
on. It is possible to say that there is no god, what happens to one is a re=
sult of one's own actions and engaging in actions with sama drishti liberat=
es one (e.g. Buddha). It may not be the only or the best path to liberation=
, but it is A valid path within Sanatana Dharma to liberation.
 
So, if you=
 see someone with bad conduct doing well, it must be a result of good condu=
ct in the past. If you see someone with good conduct doing badly, it must b=
e a result of bad conduct in the past.
 
Your present is not in your contro=
l. Your present was under your control in the past, but not anymore. Howeve=
r, your future is under your control now. By doing good deeds now, you can =
ensure good future. Regret about the past or bitterness about the present r=
esults of past deeds should not cloud one's judgment w.r.t. present actions=
.
 
Do the right actions now, that you think will give you the kind of futu=
re you are hoping for. At the same time, if possible, work on eliminating h=
opes like "I want this kind of future or that kind of future". As long as s=
uch notions are there, one guesses what actions produce such future, one en=
gages in various actions and fulfils one's hope to varying degrees and gene=
rates new hopes in the process. It is an infinite cycle. One is liberated o=
nly when one is free from these hopes and desires. But, worry about liberat=
ion is secondary. Primary thing is to engage in the right actions that give=
 you the future you hope for.
 
Namaste Sundeep,
 
Shakti worship is not ju=
st certain rituals. Saattwik aspects of Shakti manifest as various kinds of=
 knowledge, raajasik aspects of Shakti manifest as various kinds of actions=
, taamasik aspects of Shakti manifest as various kinds of desires. Whether =
one is aware or not, one is worshipping various forms of Shakti every momen=
t through one's desires, actions and knowledge!
 
However, this happens in =
an uncontrolled and unaware fashion. Formal worship of specific Shakti form=
s aims to fill this worship with awareness.
 
Real life relief and enlighte=
nment that you speak of is given by Shakti, but that can come with or witho=
ut formal worship of Shakti.
 
One small but subtle point. Suppose one wors=
hips Vishnu or Shiva or Agni or Surya, but mind is strongly focused on cert=
ain desires or actions or knowledge. Then, can I really say that one is not=
 worshipping Shakti? Who is Shakti after all? If you see Chandipath second =
chapter, you will see that She is a personification of the sum total of the=
 energies of various deities. Purusha is the potential energy and Shakti is=
 the kinetic energy. Some of the kinetic energies of all gods (or all being=
 actually) is Aadi Shakti. If one interested in kinetic aspects is worshipp=
ing any deity (Vishnu or Shiva or Surya or Agni or whoever), one is then es=
sentially worshipping the kinetic energy aspect of that deity. That is noth=
ing but a part of Aadi Shakti. Thus, without formal worship of Shakti and b=
y worship of other deities also, one can effectively worship Shakti and get=
 Shakti's blessings.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

ept of "I" and "ownership" is the key pathway for the pain. Now, there are =
2 possibilities here - either there is nothing more than the I (the atheist=
ic view), or there is something more than the I (the theistic view). The fi=
rst path for you and me leads to continuous pain (at least right now), beca=
use it means either there is pain or there is nothing, because at least I c=
an't think of any easy material solution to my problems - they must be live=
d through. So the first path is not very useful. So, you will agree that it=
 is worthwhile to at least try out the second path. Now, if the second path=
 is real, there is something more than the I, so there must be a way to at =
least temporarily disassociate your deeper consciousness from the "I" and "=
ownership" that is the key pathway to the pain? For me, I have found that c=
oncentration meditation (even with mantras) wasn't doing the trick. I switc=

to whatever it is that is out there (for me this was a long path, eventuall=
y I found through dreams and hints that it had to be a mother based form th=
at I had to give myself up to). Now this is easier said than done. You cant=
 form the words "I give up myself to you" in your mind. That is totally, th=
oroughly, useless, because the moment you form the words, the "I" proudly t=
akes control and starts trying to give up everything but itself. Somewhere =
within your meditating mind "you" must catch yourself and let it to go. Thi=

 is a very personal thing - but nevertheless is key to any success.

 - I understand that the relief corresponds in some sense to a small patch =

not correlate with real life. So is it correct to say that if you want to h=

 must necessarily do some Shakti type worship?
