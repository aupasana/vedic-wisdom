Namaste,
 
A lot of paradoxes result from mixing up no-duality with duality=
.
 
Statements like "god exists everywhere" are based on non-duality. The e=
ssence of cosmic being (Parama Purusha) who evolved from Brahman fills all.=

 
But at this level, there is no difference between birth or death, happin=
ess or sadness, pleasure or pain, killing or being killed. The opposites ar=
e but a delusion here. So killing is of no consequence.
 
But, for most peo=
ple, these opposites are quite different. We are caught in duality and ther=
e is no point in mixing up with non-duality. At the level of duality, there=
 are good and bad, gods and demons, pleasure and pain, birth and death etc,=
 and they are different. There are opposites, one is desirable and the othe=
r undesirable. Most rules given in scriptures are based on the dual world, =
but sometimes people mix up some principles of non-duality with it and crea=
te confusion.
 
Duality and non-duality are two totally different concepts =
and one should NOT mix them up. Unfortunately, pseudo-scholars have mixed t=
hem up and created paradoxes and confusions in the last few centuries.
 
* =
       *        *
 
If you see difference between Rama and Ravana and betwe=
en Dharmaraja and Duryodhana, you are in duality. Don't pretend that all is=
 the same (god) then. For you, there are opposites and there is good and th=
ere is bad. All is not god.
 
To promote good and control bad, do what your=
 conscience tells you to do, with as little attachment with the actions as =
possible.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

        Namaste, 
        Confusing statements:
        a) Ki=
lling is prohibited as God is sarva vyapakeswara and is existent in everyon=
e

        b) Killing is alright when seen through the filter of dharma or =
detachment. Justified in Gita with the usage "We are the instruments in the=
 Godly plan and hence we are not killing" / "Duty of a Kshatriya is to defe=
at enemy when the Truth is abused"

        May be knowledgeable people on =
this forum can clear our doubts. 

        * * *
        I have come across=
 a similar upanishadic paradoxes and it is clarified brilliantly in a book.=
 

        Paradoxes: 
        1) Truth is unchanging and rest is changing
=
        2) Truth is present in all mortal beings 
        3) The universe i=
s a manifestation of Truth. If so, why is Universe encapsulated in time fra=
me?
        The author in the said book, clearly links all together and sho=
ws that there are no paradoxes. 

        * * *

        May be we are miss=
ing something which can be used to remove the paradoxes of statements a & b=
 

        God Bless All,

                I have taken that line into consideration. N=
ow read Narasimhajis mail, specially the last part. on finding what is Dhar=
ma and what is not. The line written by Svoboda is vague at best. If I go b=
y the paramters of 1) What one is inclined mentally to do
                2=
) What his teachers say. 3) What his scriptures say "(subject to interpreta=
tion).

                So technically a terrorist may have all the mental/=
internal/dharmic justification to act the way he acts.

                The=
 root lies in, why do such situations arise where the dharma of a person ha=
s to be that he should become a terrorist? The answer is karma. So therefor=
e, focusing on karma is far more profitable I feel.
