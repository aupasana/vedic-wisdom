Namaskaram,

I apologize if I gave the impression that I was calling something "superior" 
and something else "inferior". That was not my intention.

I was only trying to say that seemingly different views in various Hindu 
traditions are not contradictory, but it is possible to synthesize all into 
one coherent understanding, based on the teachings of maharshis.

One insect may sit on the trunk of an elephant and describe the elephant as 
it sees. Another insect may sit on the back of the same elephant and 
describe what it sees. Yet another insect may sit at the end of the tail of 
the same elephant and describe what it sees. And so on. Each insect may 
think that it is describing the elephant accurately.

One can view the descriptions as being totally different and just select 
what one likes. Or one can synthesize them all into one understanding.

In any case, I see your subtly made point about discussing Vedanta on a 
Shaiva list. So I will respectfully withdraw. However, before I withdraw, I 
want to point out that some views I have mentioned were explicitly taught by 
Lord Shiva Himself to Maharshi Vasishtha.

My apologies if I ruffled any feathers with the Vedantic discussions in the 
last few days.

Best regards,
Narasimha

I donï¿½t belive it is neccessary to discuss whether one darshana is
superior and another one inferior it is sufficent for us to note that
there are indeed great differences of opinion and practical approach
between the darshanas.

Because our discussion is happening in a mailing list called
sivacharya i thought it is appropriate to remark that vedanta
darshana is not the same as shaiva darshanas regarding their
viewpoint on maya and shakti and less appropriate to praise the
superiority of vedanta over agam.

For a scholarly exposition on the differences please consult this
