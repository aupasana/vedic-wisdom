Namaste,

(1) The pendant is the meru. You start from a bead next to it and keep going 
to the next bead. When you finish all the beads and come to the last one (on 
the other side of the pendant), you start the next cycle right there and go 
in reverse direction. Suppose beads are B1, B2, B3, ..., B53, B54. You go as 
B1, B2, B3, ..., B53, B54 and then go B54, B53, B52, ..., B3, B2, B1.

Instead, if one goes as B1, B2, B3, ..., B52, B53, B54, and then again B1, 
B2, B3, ... etc, that is called crossing the meru. When going from B54 to 
B1, one crosses over the meru. It is better to avoid that and do as 
mentioned above.

(2) Either is fine.

(3) Yes.

(4) There are two views. Some people keep the maalaa in pooja room and treat 
it auspiciously. Some people keep the maalaa on their body to protect them 
and be available at all times for do japam.

If you keep it on the body always, the question is what do you do at the 
time of activities like emptying the bowels. Some people consider those 
activities as impure and remove the maalaa at those times.Some people keep 
it all the time no matter what they are doing.

If there is any feeling of impurity in one's mind when doing certain things, 
it is a good idea to remove the maalaa. If one is fully comfortable and has 
no such feelings of impurity or guilt, then one can keep it on at all times.

Good luck with the maalaa.

Best regards,
Narasimha
