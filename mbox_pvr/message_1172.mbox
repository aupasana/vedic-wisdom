Namaste,
 
The nature of mind is to wander and think various things. Mind w=
ill stop thinking only when it is in samadhi. Until then, it will continue =
to get some good thoughts and some bad thoughts. That is its nature.
 
The =
goal of sadhana is to train the mind to focus on one thing. Some may train =
the mind to focus on a mantra. Some may train the mind to focus on musical =
notes. Some may train the mind to focus on the breathing. In various types =
of spiritual sadhana, you have one object for the mind to focus on. Still, =
mind tries to wander off all the time.
 
If a computer is running a program=
 and a virus or spyware or adware starts running, an anti-virus program's w=
atchdog task that is running in the same computer detects it and deletes it=
 (before it does much harm). Similarly, install a watchdog task in your min=
d. Suppose you are meditating or doing some sadhana and trying to focus the=
 mind on something. Suppose some other (good or bad!) thoughts come to the =
mind. As soon as you are aware of it (i.e. the watchdog task detects them),=
 simply delete the thoughts.
 
I recommend not getting aggravated or frustr=
ated at the bad thoughts. Just become aware of them and tell yourself to fo=
cus on the mantra. It is *natural* for the mind to be thinking of those bad=
 thoughts. By being aggravated or frustrated, you are only increasing the d=
istraction. It is like picking fight with a heckler who interrupts a speech=
 you are giving or a song you are singing. Become aware and move on. If you=
 pick a fight with the heckler it does more harm than the original heckling=
!
 
By being aware of the distraction, acknowledging it and then consciousl=
y trying to ignore it, you are maximizing your chances of successfully retu=
rning the full attention of the mind to the mantra. Of course, the distract=
ion will keep coming again and again. But the best option is to tell your m=
ind to focus on the mantra each time you are aware of the distraction. Do N=
OT get frustrated. As you keep doing this over and over and over, the heckl=
er may decide to shut up. Similarly, as you ignore distractions of the mind=
, eventually oneday a pleasant accident will happen and mind will achieve a=
bsolute focus on the mantra, with no other thoughts! THAT is when you exper=
ience the mantra and deity. Until then, it is a rehearsal.
 
All thoughts -=
 good or bad - are distractions. When you are meditating with a mantra, the=
 mind should be focused on ONE thing. That one thing can be the sound of th=
e mantra or an image of the deity you have in your mind or a thought that "=
so and so deity is supreme. I am an insignificant servant" etc. Try to focu=
s your mind on that one focus point. As other thoughts come, become aware a=
nd move on without any frustration or sadness or anger or disappointment.
 =

Original mail said: "In my heart I definetly do not want them to materiali=
ze.". Please realize that one's thinking or not thinking of something has n=
othing to do with something happening or not happening. Thinking that you m=
ake several things happen, that there is a cause-effect relationship betwee=
n various things in the universe and you have a role in it is an unnecessar=
y burden. Tell yourself that She (or He) does it all and you are just an in=
significant servant who happens to be there observing it all. It is a simpl=
er world view and one that does not burden you. Moreover, it is a more accu=
rate view.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

        Dear Sir,
        I also agree with this mail.=
 I feel I have double minds. One is reading Chandipath or doing Japam and o=
ther mind is thinking on various thoughts. Is it possible that we have two =
minds at a time? Because when we think on other issues while reading Chandi=
path, the first mind reading Path is not at all stopped. Path is going on m=
entally.

          Dear Narasimha,

      =
    Namaskar

          Thank you for answering all my queries. I really ha=
ve a nagging problem 
          which others may be experiencing at various=
 intensities. 

          Without fail, my mind thinks of a very particular=
 highly negative thought whenever I am 
          doing Japa.
          Oft=
en I try to negate it in my mind with the obvious result that my Japa gets =
destroyed.
          I am paranoid about these bad thought coming true, esp=
ecially as I am thinking them 
          while doing Japa. In my heart I de=
finetly do not want them to materialize. How should I 
          proceed? 
=

          Please advise.

          Thank you yet again.
