Namaste,
 
There are 11 days instead of 10 from Pratipada to Vijaya Dasami =
this time. If you look at the nights before Vijaya Dasami, then there are t=
en nights instead of nine this year. This happens sometimes.
 
If you live =
on US east coast, then Chaturthi comes twices on Thursday and Friday (Oct 2=
 & 3). It lasted the entire Thursday and extended into Friday. Panchami was=
 on Saturday (Oct 4). Shashthi was on Sunday (Oct 5). Ashtami is on Tuesday=
 (Oct 8). Navami is on Wednesday (Oct 9). Dasami is on Thursday (Oct 10).
 =

If one's parents did not do a proper "anna praasana" ritual (the ritual of=
 first feeding of solid food to a baby) to one, should one consider oneself=
 not entitled to eat any solid food? Not doing a mantra because of no initi=
ation is basically like that.
 
Getting initiation is good, especially if t=
he one initiating has some level of sadhana in that mantra. But it is neith=
er necessary nor sufficient for making progress in your own sadhana.
 
If y=
ou see my homam document, I gave an analogy for this. A millionaire may ope=
n a bank account in his son's name with a starting balance of a million dol=
lars. This is akin to a good guru initiating a sishya in a mantra. Sishya s=
tarts off by getting some of guru's attainment. But the son may waste those=
 million dollars and end up with nothing. Similarly the sishya may fall and=
 not achieve anything. Another person may not have anyone to give money and=
 may start off with a zero bank balance but accumulate millions of dollars =
with own effort. This is akin to a person doing sadhana with a mantra witho=
ut guru and attaining some level in the mantra.
 
Some people hold the view=
 that mantras cannot be chanted without a proper "initiation". This view is=
 especially prevalent in some sections of society w.r.t. navarna mantra. Ho=
wever, I disagree with that view.
 
If you know the mantra (!), just chant =
it. What would an initiating guru have done for you? Perhaps he would've gi=
ven some of his attainment in the mantra to you. Well, you can do it yourse=
lf if you work hard. Or a guru would've taught you the right nyasas to be d=
one before the mantra. Well, you can get the nyasas from books too. Moreove=
r, what most people do today for nyasas is anyway just a ritual with no mea=
ning. Nyasa literally means placement. You place various sounds in various =
body parts (like the tips of various fingers, heart, top of head, eyes etc)=
. People merely act out some signals while saying the sounds. This "placeme=
nt" is actually supposed to be an internal act and it creates an ideal envi=
ronment for the repetition of mantra. Due to the external actions, what is =
supposed to occur internally does not occur in most. So the sounds end up n=
ot getting properly placed in the body. In other words, what I am trying to=
 say is that most people do not know how to "place" various "sounds" in var=
ious body parts. They merely perform meaningless ritualistic actions. So, i=
f you do not know nyasas, you are not really missing much compared to other=
s who were initiated.
 
In my humble opinion, the most important qualificat=
ion is to have devotion and sense of surrender to Her. If you have them, yo=
u can consider yourself "highly initiated".
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

ratri...


  Dear Narasimha,

  When does Navratri end? It started on last =
Monday, September 29, 2008 and should therefore end on Tuesday, October 7, =
2008 (Nine Nights)...yet the panchang shows that at sunrise on Wednesday, O=
ctober 8 starts with Navami, so should we continue our Navratri on Wednesda=
y too even though it is technically the 10th day? (All these times are base=
d on US EST)..

  Also, can anyone do the Navarna mantra, "Om Aim Hrim Klim=
 Chamundayai Vicche" or does this require initiation?

  Thanks,
  Chandrap=
rakash
