Namaste,
 
One possibility is that your children also sit facing east, next to you or your wife. Or, they can sit facing north.
 
Yes, vada can certainly be offered as naivedyam and offered in homam. You can offer it when you offer naivedyam in the beginning (after invocation) or in the end (before uttarangam). Show naivedyam to fire and offer some in the fire. Make sure that the amount you offer is compatible with the size of the fire, i.e. fire should be able to eventually devour everything you offered.
 
Good luck with the homam!
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
