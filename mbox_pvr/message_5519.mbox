'Always' is a wrong choice of word here. By=C2=A0and large th=

=C2=A0
It is easy to =
preach=C2=A0ahimsa when one has no reverence for anything, be it our tall m=
asters, or be it Vedas. But when one identifies those things as ones own re=
sources and draws inspiration from those, it gets difficult to be tolerant =

Please cut down on this bellige=
rance. If you keep polluting the list with this attitude, I will have to ba=
n you from the list. We welcome all views, but one can disagree with great =
scholars and masters without belittling them or adopting an all-knowing and=
 dismissive attitude.

Aadi Shankara was not anti Veda or anti grammar. In =
fact, if you study his works, you will be amazed at some of the subtle tech=
nical nusances in his commentaries, w.r.t. grammar. In terms of Sanskrit sc=
holarship, scholarship in Vedic scriptures, breadth of commentaries of Vedi=
c literature and the linguistic richness of compositions, Aadi Shankara sta=
nds tall among all scholars of Kali yuga so far. You cannot take one specif=
ic line about the importance of devotion out of context and portray the gre=
atest and most prolific scholar of Kali yuga in an anti-scholarship light.
=

* * *

Sanskrit is a very useful language. So much great literature that s=
hows various paths to reaching god is available in Sanskrit language. Many =
Sanskrit mantras directly resonate with the energy centers in one's subtle =
consciousness. So, if one wants to learn Sanskrit or study various scriptur=
es/classics in Sanskrit, it is a great idea.

At the same time, Shankara's =
advice of chanting the name of Govinda as grammar and other technicalities =
do not rescue one in the final moments, is a wise one. Devotion to personal=
 god or *complete* surrender to personal or impersonal god is the thing tha=
t saves one in the end. Learning various shastras, performing various ritua=
ls, disciplining the mind with various activities, keeping the company of t=
he saintly - all these are for the purpose of increasing devotion and surre=
nder. Depending on one's rinas and conditioning, one is bound to engage in =
various activities, such as learning Sanskrit, studying scriptures, saying =
prayers, doing rituals etc. But, masters like Shankara remind one of the fi=
nal goal, so that people do not forget it and get bogged down.

If one want=
ing to climb a mountain keeps walking around the mountain to find the best =
path to climb, one may eventually forget that the goal is to climb the moun=
tain and be stuck at the base forever. Similarly, one who keeps learning th=
is and that forever may forget that reaching god is the final goal and get =
stuck. So compassionate masters may sometimes remind us of the final goal.
=

* * *

I am reminded of a small episode from the life of Swami Vivekananda=
.

Swami Vivekananda said at a San Francisco class: "I am the disciple of a=
 man who could not write his own name, and I am not worthy to undo his shoe=
s. How often have I wished I could take my intellect and throw it into the =
Ganges!"

Student said, "But, Swami, that is the part of you I like best."
=

Swami Vivekananda said, "That is because you are a fool, Madam =E2=80=94 l=
ike I am."

Vivekananda was named so by Ramakrishna, not because he had viv=
eka (discrimination) arising from a brilliant logical mind, but because TRU=
E viveka (discrimination) was to arise in his mind later and he was to real=
ize the limitations of his regular viveka (discrimination of logical mind).=


* * *

> That Adi shankara is celebrated in a relatively few quarters aro=
und the world,

 teachings in a

Maturity of a teacher is not measured by =
the following. And great teachers do not care about being "celebrated".

In=
 any case, it is not true that Adi Shankara is not well-celebrated. A signi=
ficant percentage of Vedanta scholarship of the last 2 millennia is influen=
ced heavily by Adi Shankara's commentaries. He shaped the thinking of India=
n philosophers for many many generations.

Apart from his scholarly works, =
the mutts established by him have shaped the religious consciousness of a s=
ignificant percentage of Hindus in the last couple of millennia.

Any teach=
ings in written/spoken words can never be perfect and perish quickly. The w=
ords of great great teachers also lose their meaning and relevance very qui=
ckly. Only the teachings of rishis and gods retain their meaning and their =
ability to influence the thinking of people forever (or for really long per=
iods). Adi Shankara's words - scholarly works as well as composed prayers -=
 have retained their meaning and power for more than a couple of millennia.=
 The longevity of his works is amazing.

* * *

It is ok to have strong opi=
nions. As people's understanding evolves, their opinions evolve too. So, wi=
se ones try not to offend others with their strong opinions. In any case, i=
nsulting saints, avataras of gods and rishis, based on half-baked understan=
ding of their teachings, is not good karma. I request members to be conside=
rate, tolerant and respectful to others.

Best regards,
Narasimha
