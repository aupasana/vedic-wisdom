Namaste friends,
 
I normally do not read vedic-astrology yahoogroup, but h=
appened to catch the following gem of a mail on a rare visit.
 
The concept=
 of karma (previous actions), karmaphala (results of previous actions), par=
ihaaras/upaayas (remedies) and god are complicated and sometimes misunderst=
ood. I appreciate what Rohiniranjan says below.
 
Some of these things are =
tackled on the yahoogroup "vedic-wisdom" where I have been active in the la=
st year or two. This yahoogroup is dedicated to spirituality, Sanatana dhar=
ma and understanding the true meaning of the teachings of rishis on dharma =
and spirituality. Anybody interested in spiritual matters is most welcome t=
o join. But please note that astrology and horoscope discussions are not we=
lcome. The list is strictly for discussing spirituality.
 
A few sample pos=
ts from the last few months that are somewhat relevant to the question aske=
d below are listed below. You can read them in the archives by following th=
e links below. Of course, you are welcome to read the entire archives too, =
which can be accessed by non-members.
