      Namaste Sir,

          There is no need for either Sri or Ji in addr=
essing me.

          Hoping you won't mind, I am sending this reply to som=
e yahoogroups that may have some interested people. When I was meditating b=
efore replying to you, a really beautiful and meaningful analogy came to me=
 and I think it is worth sharing with more people than just you. To ensure =
your anonymity, I removed references in the quoted mail below that may help=
 one identify you.

          *        *        *

          First I will a=
nswer your first question in detail, because that can automatically answer =
other questions.

          > 1. Are Vedic (Pure Vaithika rituals) differen=
t from Mantra Shastras
          > (people explain that mantra shastra does=
 not originate from the vedas,
          > but classified under tantra). Di=
d Mantra shastras not originate from vedas?

          *        *        *
=

          When people say what is in Veda and what is not, honestly I can =
only laugh. They are only fooling themselves. Reciting Veda with perfect sw=
ara or mastering a celebrated commentary does not help one understand Veda.=
 In fact, understanding each single verse in Veda requires great tapaschary=
a. Understanding a verse in Veda is neither possible with energy flowing in=
 Ida nadi (intuition) nor in Pingala nadi (logic and analysis). It is possi=
ble only with energy flowing in Sushumna nadi. It is possible with neither =
intuition nor logic, but only with *revelation* and simply, for the lack of=
 a better expression, direct knowledge.

          When one meditates long =
enough on a verse, the verse may simply be revealed to the yogi. THAT is th=
e only way to understand a Vedic verse. For most people, it is not possible=
 to decipher even a single verse in an entire life, let alone a passage.

 =
         Bottomoline is: Almost nobody understands Veda today. What are con=
sidered "pure vaidika rituals" are merely another variety of rituals create=
d by someone at some point of time. From the point of view of authenticity =
as granted by Veda, there is no difference between them and other aagamic r=
ituals, though people ignorantly believe otherwise.

          *        *  =
      *

          A simple analogy may help clarify a lot of things relate=
d to this complicated issue a little. What the thing in the analogy represe=
nts is shown here and there in square brackets [].

          Once there we=
re many people who lived near the sea [Brahman/Aatman] . They regularly sat=
 by the sea and enjoyed the sight and sound of the sea [experienced Brahman=
]. They described the sea in some nice cryptic poems [Veda].

          As =
people started living a little away from the sea [less spiritually evolved]=
, someone had to put together some instructions on how to reach the sea. He=
 said, "keep walking towards east" and the instructions grew with time. Peo=
ple faithfully followed the instructions [rituals].

          People start=
ed moving further and further inland and started living in a landlocked des=
ert far away from the sea. This generation had never seen a pool of water l=
ike a lake, let alone a sea. They faithfully performed the ritual of walkin=
g towards east, but did not find sea. They debated endlessly whether one ha=
d to walk one mile or two miles or three miles and formed different schools=
 of thought. Some walked their chosen distance, found a tree or a building =
or some interesting object and even became satisfied that that was sea!

  =
        Then came some great person, whose instincts led him to take a hors=
e instead of walking and ride it for a long distance [use of other tools]. =
He did find the sea after a few months. He put together newer instructions =
to reach the sea, which included riding a horse [new aagamas].

          P=
eople performing the old rituals objected to this and said "but then this h=
orse thing is not granted by the book of sea. This is a new path and differ=
ent from the "pure" sea ritual" ["pure" Vedic ritual]. By now, people did n=
ot even understand what the cryptic poems of the original "book of sea" mea=
n, but they simply believed that those poems taught the old "pure" sea ritu=
als that they were used to. They were blissfully unaware that the original =
instructions were meant for someone already close to sea and the newer inst=
ructions came from someone who actually saw the sea and knew where they cur=
rently lived and how to get to the sea from there!

          Slowly many n=
ew sets of instructions involving horses, chariots etc were taught and many=
 new paths to the sea were outlined instead of just instructing people to w=
alk towards east [evolution of mantra/tantra/ yantras].

          One part=
icular path through jungles was dangerous [aghora and other dark tantric pa=
ths involving practice of sex, meat, wine etc]. Though the distance to sea =
was much shorter through that jungle, it was just too dangerous and only th=
e bravest and strongest could make it. There were cruel dacoits and wild an=
imals [chance of a fall in a risky ritual] and many weak people travelling =
to sea via that path were killed. A wise man who knew the entire territory =
well came forward, condemned that path and discouraged people from trying t=
hat path. Since then, even people who were strong enough to successfully ma=
ke it in that path desisted from it.

          As time progressed, people =
started fighting too much about whose path was superior. They were foolish,=
 not smart enough to adopt the original instructions, of either the so-call=
ed "pure" sea path or the so-called "new" path or other variations, for the=
 changed geography and changed times. Many followed the instructions blindl=
y, hit roadblocks and did not reach sea. Many did not even know that "reach=
ing the sea" was the actual goal of all their joirneys. They only thought t=
hey were supposed to follow the instructions faithfully and there was no ne=
ed to adopt to the changed geographical territory and time. They even conde=
mned those who actually went to sea, came back and gave updated directions =
for their place and time, for violating tradition.

          *        *   =
     *

          In case the analogy is not clear, here is a brief summary=
 of its points. Veda is about realizing self. Veda describes various aspect=
s of the state of self-realization. That is why it is considered the highes=
t knowledge. Other allied subjects throw some light on possible ways to rea=
ch that state. While definitive statements can be made on the actual state =
of self-realization itself, no definitive statements can be made on how to =
reach it. The path depends on one's current position!

          Great men =
in many spiritual paths, within Hinduism as well as outside of it, came, ex=
perienced that state, understood the current state of people around them an=
d gave specific instructions on how to reach that state from the current st=
ate. Some followed the instructions and experienced the state. Some instead=
 kept arguing about the contradictions between paths.

          Please re-=
read the story and try to understand what each part of the story represents=
. If you understand this analogy well, this can really clarify the meaningl=
ess nature of so many debates that people waste time with!

          *    =
    *        *

          > 2. I read from somewhere that Sri Sri Adi Sanka=
ra has condemned
          > Tantrik practices. But I also hear and read th=
at he is a great Sri Vidya
          > Upasaka himself. If Sri Vidya has it=
s roots from Tantra, what did
          > Sri Adi Sankara condemn? 

      =
    He did condemn some vaamaachaara (left-hand) practices of tantra like t=
he use of sex, alcohol, meat etc.

          However, please go back to my =
analogy. A great man may condemn the use of a short path to reach the sea i=
f it has a lot of wild animals and dacoits and many travellers through that=
 path recently lost their lives. It does not mean that path is totally unus=
able. It only means that too many people incapable of travelling on that pa=
th are using it of late and so the great man was compelled to stop the prac=
tice.

          If the same great man is reincarnated at a different time =
when several adept souls he has a rina with are about to be reincarnated, h=
e may not condemn the path and instead write on travelling that jungle path=
 carefully!

          The words of great masters need to be interpreted wi=
thin the context of their desa, kaala and paatra and within the context of =
the purpose of that particular birth.

          *        *        *

     =
     > 3. What is vamachara? if it is the left hand method - sex, drinks et=
c,
          > why must it be practiced at all?

          Suppose one's ho=
use is close to the market and the market noise reaches one's house. Suppos=
e that noise is disturbing one's meditation, i.e. one is unable to focus on=
 god amid all the noise. There are two approaches one can take - (1) run aw=
ay from the noise, find a place of solitude and meditate there. (2) rise to=
 the challenge, meditate right there and develop the ability to turn off th=
e sensory input to the mind, i.e. get mastery and control over the part of =
the mind that is making one vulnerable to this disturbance. After all, the =
noise from outside is NOT the problem - the problem is the *inability* of o=
ne's mind to turn off that sensory input. By controlling one's mind, one ca=
n focus attention on god irrespective of what is happening outside.

      =
    Approach (1) is not bad. If one is weak-minded and has a decent chance =
of failure with approach (2), then approach (1) is definitely prudent and w=
orthwhile. But, if one has a strong mind and can succeed with approach (2),=
 it is great. It hastens one's progress.

          *        *        *

  =
        Vaamaachaara is also like that, but a more extreme form of testing =
one's self-control by rising to the challenge.

          Please realize th=
at vaamaachaara/ aghora is not about the use of sex, wine etc for the kick =
of it. It is about their use to test oneself with the toughest challenges a=
nd hone one's self-control. Self-realization comes when self-control is per=
fect and one's mind can always be focussed on god no matter what is going o=
n around one. If one is either attracted or averse to any one thing, that i=
s enough to block self-realization.

          However, if one is weak, it =
is better to stay away from vaamaachaara. One needs to do other practices a=
nd strengthen oneself. If a really pure yogi with perfect self-control is a=
ble to focus on god with all his mind even when he is drunk and sitting nak=
ed with a beautiful naked woman tightly embracing him, then he can try that=
 to test his self-control and hone it. But, if that is going to tempt one, =
get the mind away from god and onto a physical enjoyment, then one better n=
ot try that path! Just as one who does not have a strong mind to meditate a=
mid noise should meditate in solitude and hone one's self-control, one who =
does not have a strong mind to keep the focus on god in the middle of norma=
lly depriving practices such as wine, meat and sex should stay away from th=
ose.

          *        *        *

          In my analogy before, the sh=
ort jungle path to the sea having the danger of wild animals and dacoits re=
presents the vaamaachaara path of aghora. If one not having the wherewithal=
 to battle and kill the wild animals and dacoits tries that path, one may b=
e killed. Similarly, one who wants self-realization using this path will fa=
ll if one does not have perfect self-control. If one takes this path becaus=
e it sounds cool or exciting, one is likely to fall. It is only for the fit=
test and bravest.

          If there is ANY weakness in one's self-control=
, one can NOT follow this path. Just as there are many paths from the deser=
t to the sea in my analogy, there are many paths to self-realization. One s=
hould follow the path that is appropriate for one based on previous samskar=
as, strengths and weaknesses.

          *        *        *

          > I=
s it not a fact that Sri Ambal lies above all these? 

          :-) Sri Am=
bal (the Divine Mother) does not lie above or below anything. She lies ever=
ywhere! All knowledge, all desires and all actions of all beings are Her ow=
n different manifestations.

          If a yogi with perfect self-control =
drinks wine and sits naked with a beautiful naked woman tightly embracing h=
im and yet keeps his mind fully focussed on god, his self-control, his focu=
s on god are all different manifestations of the Divine Mother only.

     =
     As a matter of fact, even if one gives in to base instincts and pursue=
s carnal pleasures, his desires and actions are also different manifestatio=
ns of Divine Mother only. The Mother gives rise to so many lower level form=
s with specific domains of responsibility. The Mother takes the form of Lak=
shmi and Alakshmi as well. She takes the form of Vidya and Avidya as well. =
All opposites and polarities are actually Her manifestations only.

       =
   However, those who are more comfortable with Lakshmi and Vidya and uncom=
fortable with Alakshmi and Avidya will look at only the former pair as mani=
festation of Divine Mother and remain in duality. That is a valid point of =
view. However, the *ultimate* reality is that She is All.

          I need=
 to sleep now. I will stop here. Hope that put a few things in perspective.=
 You can send further questions to the yahoogroups or to me privately.

            1. Are Vedic (Pure Vait=

Mantra shastras not originate from vedas?

            2. I read from somew=
here that Sri Sri Adi Sankara has condemned Tantrik practices. But I also h=
ear and read that he is a great Sri Vidya Upasaka himself. If Sri Vidya has=
 its roots from Tantra, what did Sri Adi Sankara condemn? 

            3. =
What is vamachara? if it is the left hand method - sex, drinks etc, why mus=
