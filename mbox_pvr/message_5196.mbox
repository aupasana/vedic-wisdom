Namaste,
 
Yes, these verses from Bhagavd Gita are saying that the Supreme Being is beyond all forms and beyond all limitations. Worshipping various forms is good and begets various results, but supreme is the worship of Supreme Being, who is beyond forms and manifestation and is inexpressible.
 
*        *        *
 
Reaching the formless (or, in other words, the supreme inexpressible form) is not easy. Instead of trying to reach the formless, hold on to a form. Once you reach a form, reaching the formless through that form may be easier.
 
Doing mental math may be better than jotting things down on a paper and doing the steps methodically on it. However, if you keep making mistakes in mental math, you're better off using a paper for the work!
 
*        *        *
 
As worshipping or reaching the Supreme Being is not easy, we worship various deities (manifested forms) first and eventually trace our way back to the Supreme Being through that form. A Ganapathi worshipper in the beginnning may see Ganapathi as the remover of obstacles. Later, same Ganapathi may be realized as the Supreme Being as extolled in Ganapathi Atharvaseersham. It describes that all the worlds arise out of Ganapathi, are sustained by him and merge back in him, Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Indra, Agni, Vaayu etc are different forms of Ganapathi, etc etc. It is essentially tracing from a specific form of Ganapathi to the supreme being. Similar approach is taken with all forms.
 
*        *        *
 
To give a crude analogy, gold can be used for many purposes. Specific forms like a gold ring and a golden arrow may be used for specific purposes. But gold itself can be fashioned in any form to fulfil any purpose. But, in order to acquire gold, one may acquire a specific object made of gold. For example, one may get a gold chain, use it for a specific purpose, and then forget that it is chain used for a purpose and look at it as just gold. One can simply look at it as gold that can be used for making so many things and fulfilling so many purposes.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

> Dear Narasimha,

Another question. No hurries, answer whenever you feel like.

<<<yo yo yAm yAm tanum bhaktah shraddhayArchitumichchhati |
tasya tasyAchalAm shraddhAm tAmewa widadhAmyaham ||[7:21]

Whichever demigod a given devotee desires with faith, I surely sustain firmly 
that faith in him.

sa tayA shraddhayA yuktastasyaArAdhanamIhatE |
labhatE cha tatah kAmAnmayaiwa wihitAnhi tAn ||[7:22]

Endowed with that firm faith, the devotee worships the demigod and sanctioned by 
Me solely; obtains that which he desired from that demigod.

antawattu phalam tEshAm tadbhawatyalpamEdhasAm |
dEwAndEwayajO yAnti madbhaktA yAnti mAmapi ||[7:23]

The result is: those with a challenged intellect, the votaries of demigods, 
obtain the demigod; but My devotees obtain Me.

awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |
param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]

Unable to comprehend My imperishable, exalted and supreme state of being, those 
deficient in spirituality regard Me, the unmanifest, as taking physical 
forms. >>>

Do these slokas from the Gita mean that the best worship is formless worship?

-Regards
