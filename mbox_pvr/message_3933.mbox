Dear Narasimharao garu and others, 
=C2=A0
After reading these questions, I=
 have another serious question. If abstinence from sex, when the objective =
is not progeny, but only pleasure, is resulting in killing in millions of p=
otential beings and this leads in loss of Ojas in men, what about men who a=
re getting vasectomy operation? Since vastectomy involves separating the sp=
erm from semen, in my understanding,=C2=A0are the beings automatically bein=
g killed as they are produced? And can there be a spiritual progress for su=
ch a person ever?

Sri Narasimha Garu,
=C2=A0
Please look at some thoughts and questions =
that have crossed my mind and do reply of you deem them fit for a reply.
=
=C2=A0
>From Sri Manish's mail - " The aashirvaad given by the sperm for not=
 being killed (millions of such > beings), is so tremendous that the Ojas o=
f such a sadhaka amplifies
> tremendously. "
=C2=A0
I tend to agree with th=
e point of killing all such probable beings that are getting killed by the =
act...and from the Vimalandas words our life is a result of the accumulated=
 Blessings and Curses..
=C2=A0
We inhale and exhale continuously and in the=
 process kill so many micro beings..whill that accumulate to any curse or i=
s there any process that helps us in getting over such karma? 
=C2=A0
Also,=
 when we fall sick we would tend to take antibiotics etc that in turn would=
 kill so many such micro beings..what affects that may have on our Karma sh=
eet..
=C2=A0
Also, we may be soing such acts very unknowingly. .does the ac=
ts that are performed unknowingly have equal impact as ones done with full =
consciousness. .
=C2=A0
also just wondering here about doing the karmas in =
a detatched fashion (though knowing what we are doing in full consiousness)=
 vs acts done unknowingly (without we knowing what we have done or going to=
 do etc and hence probably may not tend to associate ourself with such acts=
). Does such acts dome unknowingly ca also be under the same class of karma=
s as the karmas done as detatached ones..
=C2=A0
i'm not sure if i'm able t=
o put across my thoughts /Q's clearly..please ignore if this sounds illogic=
al..
=C2=A0
Cheers

Namaste,

I am forwarding Mani=
sh's comments on Vijay's mail.

In addition, I want to respond to Vijay's p=
oints 3 and 4.

* * *

3. The word energy or shakti may sound heavy and may=
 have all kinds of connotations in the minds of people. Shakti is simply a =
force that can be used to change or move something karmically.

Suppose you=
 see something or someone beautiful and the enemy of "desire" (one of shadr=
ipus - six internal enemies) tries to attack your mind. Or suppose someone =
abuses you and the enemy of "anger" tries to attack your mind. How does you=
r mind fight back?

Just as you need energy to fight external enemies, your=
 mind needs energy to fight internal enemies. If your mind has no shakti, t=
he enemies take over and take mind in a direction. If you mind has and exer=
ts shakti, the enemies are stopped (fully or partially) and the their push =
on the mind is negated.

When you eat, you get physical energy. When you ex=
ercise, that physical energy is stored in the right places of the body. Sim=
ilarly, when your mind spends time in a state of focused calmness, it eats =
from the universal source of shakti and gets nourished. When it spends time=
 in patterns of regulated exercises (e.g. homam, japam, bhajan, satsang etc=
), it stores that shakti in the right places in the mind.

Just as physical=
 energy helps you fight external enemies who attack you, this spiritual ene=
rgy helps you fight internal enemies who attack you.

If your surrender is =
perfect and you are going through the good and bad fruits of your karmas wi=
thout committing new karmas, your point is right. You are like a weightless=
 leaf and you need no energy - you go with the flow. But, if you still have=
 a conditioned mind that is vulnerable to attacks from shadripus and vulner=
able to committing NEW karmas, don't you think some energy is needed?

Don'=
t look at spiritual shakti as something that enables you to do great deeds =
in the world. Though that too is possible, that is a ego-promiting attitude=
 and inappropriate for most sadhakas. Looks at spiritual shakti as somethin=
g that enables you to fight back your own internal enemies and overcome you=
r own weaknesses.

* * *

4. If you are living every second without any goa=
ls/agendas/ wishes/anticipat ions at all, then you are all already liberate=
d and then your point is meaningful.

But, if you do have some some goals, =
some wishes, some anticipations, some agendas etc, then you should realize =
that those wishes and anticipations have a kinetic energy of their own (kaa=
rmically) and they bind you further. You need the spiritual energy (shakti)=
 accumulated through exertion of self-control to negate that kinetic energy=
 and stop you from getting bound further.

Some people make the mistake of =
thinking that desire of moksha is also a desire and can stop you from moksh=
a. That is true. However, it is better than many other desires and definite=
ly worth having. It can be jettisoned when the time comes.

Suppose you hav=
e a trash can in which you collect trash. Just throw away the collected tra=
sh and hang on to the trash can. If you throw away the can too, then new tr=
ash that comes in will be all over the floor. So keep the can so that you k=
eep collecting trash and throwing it away. You can throw away the trash can=
 also, when you are absolutely sure that no trash is being generated.

Best=
 regards,
Narasimha

ter. net</A>><BR>> <BR>> On Brahmacharya and virya:<BR>> <BR>&g=
t; In a ml of semen, there are millions of sperm, most
 living beings with<=
BR>> potential to form a jiva.<BR>> Look at them under a microscope i=
n a hospital if you get a chance some day.<BR>> They swim really energet=
ically, exactly like tadpoles. You would try not to<BR>> kill tadpoles n=
ormally would'nt you? or maybe, it would be ok to take God's<BR>> name a=
nd kill them?<BR>> <BR>> The point is that those poor beings are dest=
ined for short life and death<BR>> normally.<BR>> If you realised thi=
s and stopped yourself by Brahmacharya, still you would<BR>> have nightl=
y emissions. Partly, rich food, partly lots of Kama related<BR>> thought=
s are responsible.<BR>> Whenever you think of a woman/man in that way, j=
ust stop your thought by<BR>> conscious effort and look at the thought, =
you will clearly see the<BR>> copulation happening in your thought in th=
e head.<BR>> That is problematic, but essentially it means that sex star=
ts in the mind<BR>> only. Control the mind
 and things are generally fin=
e.<BR>> <BR>> The other thing is the prostatic fluid itself, if you g=
et a slight erection<BR>> say after 20-30 days of strict Brahmacharya, y=
ou will notice that although<BR>> there is no emission of sperm, some pr=
ostatic fluid comes out (this is a<BR>> form of Shukra-Acharya. ... pros=
tatic fluid nourishes sperm and ....<BR>> "teaches" it) This also repres=
ents a loss of shakti.<BR>> <BR>> Right, so, how to stop it??<BR>>=
 <BR>> Even if you are a good sadhaka and keep Bramhacharya for a few da=
ys,<BR>> someday you may be destined for a fall from Brahmacharya, for e=
xample, if<BR>> some great looking heroine comes to you and drops her cl=
othes without asking,<BR>> how many of you will be able to resist, keepi=
ng in mind that sexual imagery<BR>> from films may have already spoiled =
the mind. Most difficult... .<BR>> There are only two ways, total contro=
l, which very few can do or
 total<BR>> gratification followed by terrif=
ic sadhana.<BR>> Here is where Tantra is superb, none of these so called=
 gurus can match a<BR>> true sadhaka of tantra. Unfortunately, tantra ha=
s got a bad name just as<BR>> sitting in a smashan and doing sadhana. In=
 the former people are afraid of<BR>> Her in the form of Maya, in the ot=
her the pasha of fear which binds normal<BR>> humans.<BR>> Most norma=
l people mix up ordinary sex with a sadhana of a sexual nature.<BR>> The=
se are two separate things. Sadhana of this sort tricks the mind in many<BR=
>> ways already discussed before.<BR>> I would suggest that Shiva lat=
a Mudra is superb in bringing about the kind<BR>> of control which most =
people cannot imagine.<BR>> First, you will stick to one partner for the=
 sadhana, that is a kind of<BR>> Brahmacharya in itself.<BR>> Two, th=
e sadhana when it matures, will be so good that ordinary sex will be<BR>>=
; thrown out of the
 window.<BR>> Three, a naked woman or man can no lon=
ger arouse you in the way it did when<BR>> you first started.<BR>> Fo=
ur, the play of the deity within your respective bodies will give you<BR>&g=
t; knowledge which normal people do not have.<BR>> Five, even if you are=
 born again, your partner in this sadhana and the<BR>> deities will both=
 come to you unasked, where can they escape? The Law of<BR>> karma appli=
es to everybody.<BR>> Six, The bliss of not having to think of sex will =
occur for many months on<BR>> end.<BR>> The aashirvaad given by the s=
perm for not being killed (millions of such<BR>> beings), is so tremendo=
us that the Ojas of such a sadhaka amplifies<BR>> tremendously. Notice t=
hat i still say sadhaka, not "Great exhalted Guru" or<BR>> "Bhagawan" or=
 all that rubbish.<BR>> As far as I am concerned, very few people are qu=
alified enough to be a Guru(<BR>> I do not think that I am, but I guide =
those who
 come to me as my children).<BR>> True Gurus of the sort menti=
oned in the AGHORA books are almost impossible<BR>> to find, and even if=
 you do find such a Guru, will you do everything such a<BR>> being says?=
 How good a disciple can most of us be?<BR>> And the punishment for Guru=
 Droha to such a being..... don't even ask.<BR>> Unfortunately, sometime=
s for some people, even when a real sadhaka/<BR>> Guru comes to their do=
or, they foolishly direct that person elsewhere, such<BR>> is the force =
of maya.<BR>> <BR>> Love<BR>> Manish<BR>> <BR>> > > Fr=
