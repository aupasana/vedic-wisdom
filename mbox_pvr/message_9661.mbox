Namaste Sir,
=C2=A0
> Dont you think all these yogas are NOT an end in itse=
lf but to prepare the mind for awakening??
=C2=A0
Correct. These paths get =
one started in the walk towards the same end point - Self-realization.

=C2=
=A0
> To be free is to be awakened.
=C2=A0
Not exactly. Awakening is just a=
 step towards freedom. Freedom comes in the end after walking a path for en=
ough time after awakening.
=C2=A0
An unawakened sadhaka practicing jnana yo=
ga reads books and talks eloquently about how everything is god, but looks =
at different people, objects and experiences with a different attitude. He =
becomes happy (if not externally, atleast internally) when people praise hi=
m and becomes upset when people criticize him, and so on. An awakened sadha=
ka practicing jnana yoga starts to honestly contemplate one's actions, word=
s, thoughts (and even instincts finally) and slowly weeds out conditioning =
that makes one look at different transient things differently. As his equan=
imity increases, still there will be episodes of getting carried away. As h=
e employs contemplation and self-correction more and more, such episodes wi=
ll become less and less frequent and one will become liberated in the end.
=
=C2=A0
An unawakened sadhaka practicing karma yoga passionately engages in =
dharmik actions for the benefit of others. He gets elated and feels proud w=
hen good results come and becomes upset when bad results come. An awakened =
sadhaka practicing karma yoga starts to have detachment to results. When so=
mething happens which makes him elated, proud, ashamed or upset, he will no=
t think much about it, take it as god's prasad and think about what is the =
right action for him right now. As his detachment increases, still there wi=
ll be episodes of getting carried away. As one becomes more and more detach=
ed (to results of actions), such episodes will become less and less frequen=
t and one will become liberated in the end.
=C2=A0
An unawakened sadhaka pr=
acticing raja yoga goes through yama, niyama, pratyahara, dhyana, dharana e=
tc. His psychic life force may even arise and ascend. He may have various e=
xperiences and may feel proud or become attached to them. An awakened sadha=
ka practicing raja yoga will not not lose self-control in the face of anyth=
ing and will keep the focus on samadhi. He will not be distracted by anythi=
ng that comes on the way and keep perfecting concentration and self-control=
 so that samadhi (deep concentration on the unconditioned Self) comes. In t=
he beginning, one may be in samadhi state now and then. As practice is perf=
ected, one can be in it all the time and become liberated.
=C2=A0
An unawke=
ned sadhaka practicing bhakti yoga is devoted to god and worships him/her a=
s much as one can, but will project his ego, conditioning and desires onto =
his worship and hence onto the god he worships. For example, he may think "=
I worship the highest god while that person worships a lower god. I am bett=
er" or "I am worshipping god everyday. I will get so and so result" or "I w=
orship god more than that person. I am better". An awkened sadhaka practici=
ng bhakti yoga has little expectation, pride etc. Worship becomes not about=
 him but about god! He worships god and marvels at the power that holds thi=
s cosmos together - the power that runs things infinitismally smaller than =
a boson and infinitely larger than a galaxy. He will look at himself as a f=
ully insignificant particle in front a supreme power. His desires, likes, d=
islikes, conditioning and agendas start to seem too insignificant in front =
of contemplating about that supreme power. Even as that
 devotional spirit =
increases, there will be episodes when one becomes self-centered in one's w=
orship. But with practice, one loses oneself completely and surrenders comp=
letely to the supreme power and become liberated in the end.
=C2=A0
In each=
 path, one may walk the path without making any significant progress for a =
long time. As one starts to imbibe the inherent qualities of the path, some=
 internal transformation will kick in. Yet, the force of prior conditioning=
, coming from many lives, is too strong to overcome. One keeps walking..

 na=

>=
=C2=A0
>Here are my 2 cents.
>=C2=A0
>Jnana yoga emphasizes on philosophiza=
tion and wisdom. Karma yoga emphasizes on work and detachment. Raja yoga em=
phasizes on self-control and self-mastery. Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devoti=
on and surrender to Supreme. One can pick whatever is natural to one and tr=
y to develop that quality. However, wisdom, detached action, self-control a=
nd surrender to the Supreme are not mutually exclusive. As one of these qua=
lities develops nicely in one, others will automatically develop too! Final=
ly, a realized person (i.e. one in "Yoga" or oneness) will have all these q=
ualities fully blossomed.
>=C2=A0
>Forget about horoscope, navamsa, vimsams=
a, nakshatramsa etc. Irrespective of that, I strongly recommend against Raj=
a yoga for 99% of humanity. Even Ramakrishna advised
 against it. Controlli=
ng body and mind and forcing the psychic life force to purify and ascend re=
quires strict yama and niyama and clean nadis. In this age of polluted air,=
 water and food, nadis accumulate great amounts of obstructions and Raja yo=
ga can be dangerous. This is not just my view, but what Ramakrishna explici=
tly taught in "Gospel of Ramakrishna" (one of the greatest spiritual texts =
IMHO). He discouraged several of his sishyas from pursuing Raja Yoga. He ta=
ught it to Vivekananda, but did not encourage even him to practice it.
>=C2=
=A0
>Jnana yoga is brilliant, but there is a distinct danger of falling int=
o the delusional trap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this age are not sincere/=
honest/smart enough for it. It is easy to delude that "all is Brahman. I am=
 Brahman. Whatever I do, it's ok - it doesn't matter. It's all a delusion a=
nyway" without fully overcoming all innate conditioning that reinforces dua=
lity in consciousness every instant. Kind
 of like declaring wisely in a mo=
vie that "it's just a movie and not reality", but flinching in every scary =
scene, crying in every sad scene etc. Without absolute honesty, sincerely a=
nd earnestness, jnana yoga can be problematic too. A long path of constant =
contemplation and self-correction can be reduced to a quick delusional jump=
 to the end.

;<br>I'll quote Swami Vivekananda from his book "Raja Yoga" where he makes =
a comment on the 4 paths:<br> <br>"Each soul is potentially divine. Th=
e goal is to manifest this divinity
 within by controlling
 nature: externa=
l and internal. Do this either by work or worship or psychic control, or ph=
ilosophy - by one, or more, or all of these - and be free."<br> <br>He=
re are my 2 cents.<br> <br>Jnana yoga emphasizes on philosophization a=
nd wisdom. Karma yoga emphasizes on work and detachment. Raja yoga emphasiz=
es on self-control and self-mastery. Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devotion and=
 surrender to Supreme. One can pick whatever is natural to one and try to d=
evelop that quality. However, wisdom, detached action, self-control and sur=
render to the Supreme are not mutually exclusive. As one of these qualities=
 develops nicely in one, others will automatically develop too! Finally, a =
realized person (i.e. one in "Yoga" or oneness) will have all these qualiti=
es fully blossomed.<br> <br>Forget about horoscope, navamsa, vimsamsa,=
 nakshatramsa etc. Irrespective of that, I strongly recommend against Raja =
yoga for 99% of humanity. Even Ramakrishna advised
 against it. Controlling=
 body and mind and forcing the psychic life force to purify and ascend requ=
ires strict yama and niyama and clean nadis. In this age of polluted air, w=
ater and food, nadis accumulate great amounts of obstructions and Raja yoga=
 can be dangerous. This is not just my view, but what Ramakrishna explicitl=
y taught in "Gospel of Ramakrishna" (one of the greatest spiritual texts IM=
HO). He discouraged several of his sishyas from pursuing Raja Yoga. He taug=
ht it to Vivekananda, but did not encourage even him to practice it.<br>&nb=
sp;<br>Jnana yoga is brilliant, but there is a distinct danger of falling i=
nto the delusional trap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this age are not sincer=
e/honest/smart enough for it. It is easy to delude that "all is Brahman. I =
am Brahman. Whatever I do, it's ok - it doesn't matter. It's all a delusion=
 anyway" without fully overcoming all innate conditioning that reinforces d=
uality in consciousness every instant. Kind
 of like declaring wisely in a =
movie that "it's just a movie and not reality", but flinching in every scar=
y scene, crying in every sad scene etc. Without absolute honesty, sincerely=
 and earnestness, jnana yoga can be problematic too. A long path of constan=
t contemplation and self-correction can be reduced to a quick delusional ju=
mp to the end.<br> <br>IMHo, for most people in this age, Bhakti yoga =
and Karma yoga are the most suitable and safest.<br> <br>Best regards,=
