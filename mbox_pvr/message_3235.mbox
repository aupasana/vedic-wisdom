state in the past. The need of the hour is to have a cognitive shift from u=
nconscious state of functioning to conscious state of functioning. There is=
 no need to talk for vegetarianism or non-vegetarianism. Any memories be it=

      Namaste,

 

I have been extremely =
busy at work for a while now and will continue to be, working long hours ev=
eryday. I just saw a few mails from the vegetarianism thread. Just a few qu=
ick points.

 

*        *        *

 

Self-identification of human beings=
 and animals with body and body parts is much much stronger and denser than=
 that of plants and trees. Self-identification of plants and trees is very =
subtle. When a leaf or flower or fruit is plucked or cut off from a plant o=
r tree, the emotion experienced by it is very subtle. On the other hand, if=
 a body part is cut off in an animal or a human being, the emotion experien=
ced is much stronger. Even after death, an animal may identify with the bod=
y and think of it as "I".

 

The kaarmik debt formed by eating the flesh o=
f an animal, which the animal's mind considers as a part of "I" and is high=
ly attached to, is much bigger than the kaarmik debt formed by eating leave=
s, vegetables or fruits of a plant or a tree or killing bacteria.

 

As lo=
ng as we live in a physical body, creation of new kaarmik debts is inevitab=
le. But we strive to minimize the debts we create newly.

 

*        *    =
    *

 

You are what you eat. Our body and various chemicals and hormones=
 in it are formed based on what we eat.

 

Meat is highly taamasik. Eating=
 meat increases tamas in one. It increases ego and identification with body=
 and makes spiritual progress more difficult. After all, if one is eating f=
lesh of an animal that was highly attached to its body, the quality of body=
 attachment will become denser in one. This is not conducive to spiritual p=
rogress.

 

*        *        *

 

It is possible that a spiritual giant =
from past ate meat and yet remained fully saattwik. However, it is not easy=
 to emulate such a person. One wanting to overcome identification with the =
body and make spiritual progress, is better off eating saattwik food (simpl=
e vegetables, fruits, greens, grains etc with mild spices).

 

If a meat-e=
ating person stops eating meat and eats cooked vegetables, greens and lenti=
ls/dals (for protein) for several months, while trying to read spiritual li=
terature and trying to make spiritual progress, one will see that it makes =
a big difference.

 

*        *        *

 

Someone mentioned that Vyasa =
liked fish, Radha cooked deer for Krishna etc. In matters like this, there =
is a lot of misguided propaganda in modern India. Assertions not backed by =
specific quotes from classics or scriptures that can be verified by scholar=
s are best ignored.

 

Swami Vivekananda and Aurobindo may have given a cl=
arion call to Indians to be more pro-active and energetic. But that does no=
t require eating meat. It is wrong to attribute to them support of meat eat=
ing.

 

Best regards,

Narasimha
