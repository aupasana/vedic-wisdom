Dear Vijay,

Sp=
iritual shakti is a representation of the sincerity and correct attitude th=
at you referred to! If one is sincere, devoted and has the correct attitude=
, one DOES have spiritual shakti.
 
Spiritual shakti is not an egoistic thi=
ng. It is synonymous to internal purity. Sincerity, devotion, correct visio=
n and correct attitude come with internal purity.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha=
