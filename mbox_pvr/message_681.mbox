Namaste,

It is a bad idea to use an iron homa kundam. If there is any chance to avoid 
iron and use a better metal such as copper, that should be done.

Iron homa kundam may be used only in circumstances where there is no choice 
and the only alternative is to not do a homam at all.

Those who live in India and have a big yard can actually dig a homa kundam 
(2 ft length x 2 ft width x 1ft deep or 1 ft x 1 ft x 0.5 ft deep) and do in 
it also.

Iron represented by Saturn is not an auspicious metal.

Best regards,
Narasimha
