Namaste Tijana,

lid, otherwise

I understand where you are=
 coming from, but one will NOT lose oneself by throwing the rules to the wi=
nd regarding spiritual sadhana. In fact, one who keeps checking various das=
as, somanath drekkana, vimsamsa etc, pondering on atmakaraka, ishta devata =
etc and waiting for the right dasa, right deity and right mantra with the r=
ight number of letters etc is more likely to lose oneself easily!
 
If one =
does prayoga of a mantra for killing an enemy or attracting someone or some=
thing like that, things are different. Then rules do matter. But I want to =
emphasize that the rules given in books are full of corruptions and no wond=
er people trying such feats these days suffer so much.
 
But sadhana meant =
just for spiritual progress comes with no risks. If something is wrong, the=
 only implication is that progress is slow. Still slow progress is better t=
han no progress or retrogression.
 
My point is that Jyotish knowledge avai=
lable to us today is not perfect and contains many corruptions. Anybody who=
 thinks otherwise has not studied deeply enough yet. :-)
 
We can learn Jyo=
tish, respect it and use it when possible, but we cannot rely on it to deci=
de when to do spiritual sadhana and when to wait. If one *wants* to do a sa=
dhana, there is no reason to wait. Right now is the best time. At best, wai=
t for a good muhurta in a few weeks or months. But, using somanatha drekkan=
a or vimsamsa and waiting for right dasa is unneeded. God knows if the dasa=
 system you are using is the correct one or not. There are so many dasas af=
ter all.
 
If astrology says your digestion will be weak when Jupiter trans=
its a particular sign, will you stop eating during that one year and wait f=
or Jupiter to move out of the sign? Spiritual sadhana is as much of a *need=
* as food, water and air. One who realizes *that* should just go full-steam=
 ahead instead of bookishly checking so many technicalities of astrology ba=
sed on a corrupt understanding.
 
Not all differences are valid by the way.=
 Sometimes differences are a result of two people looking at something from=
 two angles. Both views can be appreciated and understood. Sometimes differ=
ences are a result of corruption, confusion and outright mistakes. In such =
cases, we can ignore one view.
 
> Difference is the very essence of Prakri=
ti and the one who doesn`t
> appreciate it, doesn`t know nor respect Mother=
 and will hardly reach
> the freedom from Her maya.
 
:-) :-) Yaa devi sarv=
a *buddhi* rupena samsthitaa namastasyai namastasyai namastasyai namo namah=
. Also, yaa devi sarva *bhraanti* rupena samsthitaa namastasyai namastasyai=
 namastasyai namo namah. The mother shines in all as the wisdom and discrim=
ination and the same mother shines in all as the confusion and delusion. Bo=
th are Her manifestations. Begging Her to remove the confusion and delusion=
 and grant clarity of vision and wisdom does not tantamount to disrespectin=
g to Her.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
