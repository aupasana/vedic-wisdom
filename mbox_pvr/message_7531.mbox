Namaste friends.Here few questions I have while going threw below paragraph=
,queries are in brackets.
=C2=A0
Suppose one had a very very strong and dee=
p desire to mate with a beautiful girl and could not do it in that life. Su=
ppose the girl's rinas give her rebirth as an animal(Rinas with whom?Here I=
 presume traffic from boy to girl=C2=A0is=C2=A0one way side only). If one's=
 punya(Do punyas allow to fulfil the wish of mating even?In this case think=
 of Ravana and his various desires)=C2=A0allows him to fulfil that strong d=
esire in next birth, the strength of that desire may force him to be reborn=
 as an animal and he may fulfil the desire in that life as an animal.

=C2=A0 
Namaste,
=C2=A0
Of course, human beings can be reb=
orn as animals and vice versa. Yoga Vasishtham (taught by Vasishtha to Lord=
 Rama) has many specific examples.
=C2=A0
Rebirth is not just a matter of b=
eing able to experience some things. It is also a matter of giving back to =
those one has a rina with. Depending on which beings one has a rina with an=
d what kind of rinas (and how strong), one may have to be born along with t=
hose beings.
=C2=A0
If one killed animals and ate them, the only way to pay=
 back may sometimes be to be reborn as an animal and be killed by those ani=
mals (reborn as animals or human beings).
=C2=A0
Let me give a different ki=
nd of example. Suppose one had a very very strong and deep desire to mate w=
ith a beautiful girl and could not do it in that life. Suppose the girl's r=
inas give her rebirth as an animal. If one's punya allows him to fulfil tha=
t strong desire in next birth, the strength of that desire may force him to=
 be reborn as an animal and he may fulfil the desire in that life as an ani=
mal. [Moral: Be careful what you strongly wish for!]
=C2=A0
The next birth =
is decided by one's karmas, debts, and the karmas of people one has strong =
links to, one's deeply held desires and level of good deeds to fulfil those=
 desires.
=C2=A0
There are so many situations that can force one to be rebo=
rn as an animal. Animals reborn as human beings and human beings reborn as =
animals is very common.
=C2=A0
In fact, a good percentage of human beings o=
n earth right now may be first time and last time (for now) human beings!

=C2=A0

Narasimha

spected Mr. PVR Narasimha Rao, 

May I request YOUR view on the subject. Gi=
ven you are very well read on both Dwaita and Adwaitya philosophy, what is =
your take on the subject. 

Can a human soul reincarnate in a non-human bod=
y? And if so what is the rationale? 

PS: I am aware of the reasoning in mo=
st vedic literature - e.g. 
a) To reap the fruits of past karmas 
b) The la=
st thought carries the soul in the new body etc. 

The question, however, i=
s that the Human mind & body is fully capable of experiencing all suffering=
s (as I am sure most would agree). Besides, vedic literature also gives ela=
borate description of the different types of HELLS - where a paap-Atma suff=
ers. What then necessitates a birth in a non-human form. 

Is it possible t=
hat the vedic references of non-human births were just meant to be deterren=
ts for those who are intellectually less elevated? 

Value your opinion. Ot=
hers are welcome to share their views. 
Thank you for your time & attention=
. 

Regards, 
Mahesh
