Namaste,

There are some interesting=C2=A0information about the Naths inclu=
ding GorakshaNath, 
and quite a bit of misinformation too.

Firstly, the 9 =
Naths are considered to be immortals. They are worshipped mostly 
in Mahara=
stra in India. Those who know Marathi can read the NavNath Bhaktisar. 
That=
 text is not a mere book but a powerful scripture, doing parayana of which =

can give serious spiritual benefits. There are some very old books in Beng=
ali 
too which speak of the Nath. I am yet to trace those books. But authen=
tic 
sources tell me so. For example the name of Chowrungee in Calcutta is =
based on 
the name of Chowrungee Nath.


In Nepal, Goraksha and MatsyendraN=
ath are considered to be household deities. 
Coming to Maharastra, the Nav =
Nath Bhaktisar details stories of all the 9 nath, 
their origin and their l=
ives. Lineages of the Nath are found in plenty and 
maximum=C2=A0in Maharas=
tra. This is infact considered to be Nath Bhoomi. Krishna 
decided to come =
down as Dyaneshwar, and 9 spiritual giants came along with him 
to work. Th=
ese were the Nath.

In Buddhism for example, MatsyendraNath who is the guru=
 of GorakshaNath is 
associated with Avalokiteshwara Bodhisatva. 


There a=
re Kan-phattas who consider themselves to be of the lineage of Naths. 
They=
 pierce their earlobes as a process of initiation. Similarly there are many=
 
wandering mendicants and Aghoris who also trace their lineage to the Nath=
s.

To say the X or Y Ashram in Z place is the only lineage of a Nath is ba=
sed on a 
fallacious understanding of the spiritual potency of a Nath. 


J=
ust like many ignorant people believe that the only Aghoris in the world ar=
e 
present in Kasi in Kinnaram Aghoris lineage. That is a misconception.Tha=
t is one 
lineage, but=C2=A0more are there which may or may not be in publi=
c view.=C2=A0Similarly, 
the tradition of the Naths - who were super Aghori=
s - are varied and myriard.=C2=A0

Namaste friends,

I am=

Namaste Vinay ji,

hrough Tapa for years.

As you correctly judged, I do identify with this bo=
dy most of the time, except 
at the time of experiences like the one descri=
bed below. All we can do is to 
endeavour to overcome it..

> This is the r=
eal Siddhi we should all strive for : Seal-realization.

When this discussi=
on on siddhis and shakti started a while back, that is 
essentially what I =
said. I am in full agreement with you.

Of course, knowing intellectually i=
s one thing, tasting it now and then is 
another and being it always is yet=
 another! As you said, this requires Tapas. 
Having wrong goals like obtain=
ing this siddhi or that siddhi or physical 
immortality does not help one i=
n that.

Best regards,
Narasimha

<DIV>Namaste,</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Ther=
e are some interesting information about the Naths including GorakshaN=
ath, and quite a bit of misinformation too.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Fi=
rstly, the 9 Naths are considered to be immortals. They are worshipped most=
ly in Maharastra in India. Those who know Marathi can read the NavNath Bhak=
tisar. That text is not a mere book but a powerful scripture, doing parayan=
a of which can give serious spiritual benefits. There are some very old boo=
ks in Bengali too which speak of the Nath. I am yet to trace those books. B=
ut authentic sources tell me so. For example the name of Chowrungee in Calc=
utta is based on the name of Chowrungee Nath.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>=
 </DIV>
<DIV>In Nepal, Goraksha and MatsyendraNath are considered to b=
e household deities. Coming to Maharastra, the Nav Nath Bhaktisar details s=
tories of all the 9 nath, their origin and their lives. Lineages of the Nat=
h are found in plenty and maximum in Maharastra. This is infact consid=
ered to be Nath Bhoomi. Krishna decided to come down as Dyaneshwar, and 9 s=
piritual giants came along with him to work. These were the Nath.</DIV>
<DI=
V> </DIV>
<DIV>In Buddhism for example, MatsyendraNath who is the guru=
 of GorakshaNath is associated with Avalokiteshwara Bodhisatva. </DIV>
<DIV=
> </DIV>
<DIV>There are Kan-phattas who consider themselves to be of t=
he lineage of Naths. They pierce their earlobes as a process of initiation.=
 Similarly there are many wandering mendicants and Aghoris who also trace t=
heir lineage to the Naths.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>To say the X or Y A=
shram in Z place is the only lineage of a Nath is based on a fallacious und=
erstanding of the spiritual potency of a Nath. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DI=
V>Just like many ignorant people believe that the only Aghoris in the world=
 are present in Kasi in Kinnaram Aghoris lineage. That is a misconception.T=
hat is one lineage, but more are there which may or may not be in publ=
ic view. Similarly, the tradition of the Naths - who were super Aghori=
s - are varied and myriard. </DIV>

<P>Namaste friends,<BR><BR>I am forwarding a mail from Vina=
y ji that was cc'ed to vedic-wisdom but not delivered due to non-membership=
.<BR><BR>Namaste Vinay ji,<BR><BR>> In your message above, I read "I am =
the body". This feeling<BR>> is what I endeavoured to overcome through T=
apa for years.<BR><BR>As you correctly judged, I do identify with this body=
 most of the time, except at the time of experiences like the one described=
 below. All we can do is to endeavour to overcome it..<BR><BR>> This is =
the real Siddhi we should all strive for : Seal-realization.<BR><BR>When th=
is discussion on siddhis and shakti started a while back, that is essential=
ly what I said. I am in full agreement with you.<BR><BR>Of course, knowing =
intellectually is one thing, tasting it now and then is another and being i=
t always is yet another! As you said, this requires Tapas. Having wrong goa=
ls like obtaining this siddhi or that siddhi or physical immortality does n=
ot help
 one in that.<BR><BR>Best regards,<BR>Narasimha<BR>----------------=

ual talks by others, but I really<BR>> dislike describing my experiences=
. The reason is simple : most of the<BR>> persons will not believe and t=
herefore it will serve no worthwhile<BR>> purpose. In your message above=
, I read "I am the body". This feeling<BR>> is what I endeavoured to ove=
rcome through Tapa for years. Due to my<BR>> efforts of self-purificatio=
n, which included overcoming Deep Sleep and<BR>> ensure constant Japa ev=
en throughout night, I was blessed with the<BR>> visits of many deities =
and siddhas and it will be foolish to describe<BR>> these
 experiences t=
o everone. I was gaining some siddhis, but I left<BR>> that road due to =
some unsavoury incidents. The only siddhi, if you can<BR>> call it a sid=
dhi, that I gained through Tapa and Blessings and which I<BR>> want to k=
eep is my enhanced capacity to judge things, books, persons<BR>> and eve=
nts. Earlier, I wasted years torn in the horns of the dilemma<BR>> of to=
 be or not to be a part of the false melodrama known as Samsaara,<BR>> l=
ingering in the labyrinths of Doubts of all sorts. I got the correct<BR>>=
; answer later : To be AND not to be at the same time. To be, but with a<BR=
>> Saaksheebhaava. To watch not only others, but our own actions and<BR>=
> thoughts, dreams, etc, as a mere Onlooker and not as a participant;<BR=
>> hence Not to be too. Shri Mad-Bhaagavata says : "aashaa hi paramam<BR=
>> duHkham, nairaashyam paramam sukham".<BR>><BR>> One personal ex=
perience I want to share is that the Ego I was
 thinking<BR>> as my real=
 Self got detached from me long ago, but I have not got good<BR>> riddan=
ce from it : it now abuses me but I do not care for it. I<BR>> sometimes=
 keep a pretence of Ego to deal with worldly persons, but the<BR>> real =
Ego is a detached powerless entity watched by me. Years ago, once<BR>> I=
 felt my existence sinking down at night. I asked my<BR>> Upastha/Janane=
ndriya to come up; it answered : Brahmaa ji made my<BR>> place at bottom=
, how can I come up?? Then I realized my folly. The<BR>> Praana should c=
ome up. Others may laugh at me, but the fact is that I<BR>> could hear m=
y indriyas and could talk to them as if they were separate<BR>> beings!!=
 I gradually realized that they accompany me from time<BR>> immemorial, =
but I do not really belong to them, or to this ephemeral<BR>> Body.<BR>&=
gt; This is the real Siddhi we should all strive for : Seal-realization.<BR=

 are all means. The end is Constant<B=

 of<BR>> Atman is sama-aadhi, opposed to egoistical state which is Vyaad=

abits<BR>> of mind and indriyas. That is why Tapa is required for Samaad=

 But<BR>> most of the mortals in Kaliyuga want shortcuts to evade Tapa. =
