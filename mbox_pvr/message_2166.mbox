Namaste,
 
It was during a series of 3 eclipses like this that Krishna Bhag=
avan taught Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna. This total solar eclipse has interesti=
ng planetary combinations. This is a great time for spiritual progress. In =
Boston time (EDT), the eclipse is from 7:58 pm on 2009 July 21 to 12:18 am =
on 2009 July 22. In India time (IST), it is from 5:28 am to 9:48 am on 2009=
 July 22. In GMT, it is from 11:58 pm on 2009 July 21 to 4:18 am on 2009 Ju=
ly 22.
 
You can meditate, do homam (to any deity) or just contemplate on t=
he meaning of life, who you are or on some articles or books you read. What=
ever sadhana you do during the eclipse time, all the best!
 
BTW, I am repr=
oducing a small note I wrote in Astrological eMagazine (from the publishers=
 of Astrological Magazine) below.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

A Note on the Eclipses in=
 July-Aug 2009


The occurrence of three consecutive eclipses - a lunar ecl=
ipse on 2009 July 7, a solar eclipse on 2009 July 22 and another lunar ecli=
pse on 2009 August 6 - has generated a lot of interest. Especially the sola=
r eclipse of July 22 occurs when Sun is in the 6th degree of Cancer, which =
is Sun's Mrityu Bhaga (death inflicting degree) in Cancer. When the eclipse=
 starts in New Delhi, Sun, Moon, Ketu and ascendant are in the same rasi an=
d navamsa. Hence, this can be a problematic eclipse.


Eclipse time is a ve=
ry favorable time for spiritual sadhana, though temple rituals are halted d=
uring eclipses. There is a reason for it.


Sun and Moon are the eyes of Pa=
rama Purusha (the supreme cosmic being). Microcosmically, individual soul (=
Sun) and individual mind (Moon) are the eyes through which we see the dual =
world around us. If individual soul and individual mind stop seeing, one no=
 longer experiences any objects in the field of duality. The objectificatio=
n within Brahman ceases and one is established in Brahman, i.e. non-dual ni=
rvikalpa samadhi. In other words, one realizes Self.


To fulfil one's dhar=
ma as an individual in the field of duality, one needs to be awake to the d=
uality. One needs the individualized consciousness represented by Sun and M=
oon. Hence eclipse time when Sun or Moon is blocked is unfavorable for dhar=
mik activities. Temples and temple rituals, which are performed for collect=
ive dharma of society, are understandably halted. However, it is a great ti=
me for spiritual sadhana for self-realization. This applies to homam as wel=
l. If one performs homam for material benefits, one should stop during an e=
clipse. However, if one performs homam for spiritual progress and self-real=
ization, a homam performed during an eclipse is much more powerful than at =
other times. One can perform homam to any deity during an eclipse, though h=
omam to an ugra devata may work better.
