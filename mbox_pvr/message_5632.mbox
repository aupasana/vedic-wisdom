Namaste Lalit ji,
 
Essence of what we are saying is actually the same. We =
both think that rishi is a special and sacred word applicable to a rare set=
 of beings and that people are using it irresponsibly now. Don't you realiz=
e that it is a waste of energy for us to fight each other then?
 
You seem =
to think that the originals drashtas (seers) to whom Vedic hymns were revea=
led are rishis. That is a fine view, but has no etymological justification.=
 Etyomologically, the words "rich" (rik) and "rishi" are from different roo=
ts. Rishi is from rish. I have explained what rish means (to flow/glide smo=
othly and quickly) and what rishi means. In MY view, that is the vital link=
 in understanding who a rishi is.
 
BTW, Valmiki is not the rishi of any Ve=
dic hymn, but he IS accepted as a maharshi. You said Narada is not a rishi.=
 But he IS accepted as a rishi, in fact as a devarshi (deva+rishi), i.e. a =
celestial being who flows freely with divine will with zero resistance.
 
I=
 requested you so many times to stop sending personal mails in small groups=
 like this and discuss anything you want to discuss with me on a public for=
um. I will either ignore your mails or reply to them *publicly* from now on=
wards. If that is unacceptable, please stop sending me personal mails.
 
Be=
st regards,
Narasimha

    Narsimha,
     
    For your's and o=
ther's benefits, I am re-producing definition of Rishi used in our scriptur=
es -

    Veda Mantras are called "Richa", Rikveda says - " ??? ??????  ???=
? ??????  ?????? ???? ??? ?????? ??????? ", that means Richas dwell in univ=
erse, Those who envisioned such "Richas" or Veda Mantras and understood the=
ir meanings are called Rishi, Recall Sayana's verse -  ???? ?????? ? ???? ,=
  (Rikveda Bhashya 1.1.1)

    Only MantraDrashta of Vedic Mantra is  calle=
d a Rishi, Not even "Narada", For other great devotees and sidhas other res=
pectful terms are used, however, over the period when knowledge degenerated=
 authors, writers started calling any body as "Rishi" whom they wanted to p=
raise. Distinction between Muni and Rishi got blurred in Sahitya.

    Ther=
e is no  harm in doing study and sadhana and then preaching to others,  Tho=
ugh You tried to decorate your rough ideas in posts on "Rishi", the vitalit=
y is untouched, so, do more study and more sadhana, better do both togather=
.
     
    Lalit.

        You should have b=

        The Rikvedic verse descri=
bes the process how Yajanik prepares Soma (essence) by grinding it through =
stone grinder, adds milk and water, then purifies it through woolen filter =
and t dedicates  it to Indra to have it, thus it's clear that Soma as a pla=
nt or herb was discovered by Vedic Sages, Herb Soma 's color and place of o=
rigin is also described in Rikveda.

        Over the period of time we hav=
e lost it's knowledge, it's a case almost like Mrita sanjivini Bati, howeve=
r, Mrita Sanjivini is indentifiable and still available but Soma is not.

 =
       It's true that sages use metaphores in several mantras but that's no=
t always, right now, you should be a student, and if you have some opinion =
or personal views on any matter, express that like a student, so that, read=
ers should not get influenced rather they turn to self study of vedas, upni=
shads and shastras, I hope, you are aware that a section of netfriendly you=
ngsters consider you trustworthy becuse of your JHORA but if you don't both=
er integrity and accountability by self assumed a high status for yourself =
while responding or reverting or retorting to others, that's not a help but=
 a harm.

        In above post, you also said - "Sacrificing the I-ness, I=
-am-ness, I-do-ness and the overall individualized consciousness in the fir=
e of fine discrimination is the true internal yajna that is the focus of Ve=
da and not external rituals where ghee, grains etc are offered in an extern=
al fire, though we use the external fire to increase internal fire through =
resonance".

        Sadhaka sees Ghee's Auhiti is also manifestation of Br=
ahma, External or internal everything is Brahma, Awake !

        As long a=
s you are trapped in thoughts of duality - "Spiritual Vs Material", you are=
 far away from understanding both and continue imagining and supporting or =
rejecting Vedic Wisdom in this way or other, it's all wrong.

        If yo=
u ever read Upnishads, you w'd come learn their message, Chhandogya Upnisha=
ds says -  ???? ??????? ??????,  All  is Brahma, everything is Brahma, wher=
e you see distinction - "Spiritual or Material" , "I" or "He".

        I h=
ad admonished you in the past as well, Vedas and Upinshads speaks in langua=
ge of  "I", knowing the "I-Kness" and evolving and merging the "I" to perce=
ived "He" is their message.

        This I-Ness is not Ego at all, Why you=
 look at other's ego always, It's a reflection of one's own ego, understand=
 it, You must know that Mundakopnishad catagorically states  ? ???  ????? ?=
? ????? ????? , Me atma is not attainable by powerless or weak.

        Th=
eir message is to "DO" and "See" ,  thay warn  -  ????????? ???????? ????? =
? ????? ? ?????  ???????,  they warn to those interested in spirituality ge=
t's no power, no self realization by only listening to lectures or articles=
 or by oratory, thus it should be clear to you that Vedas do speak language=
 of "I-Do" ,

        let the country and culture learn the language of "I-=
Ness" so that some aggression and integrity prevail.

        For your and =
other's benefits, I am reproducing Four Mahavakyas of our vedic wisdom, add=
ressed  to humanity -

        ?. ???????? ??????

        This Atma is Bra=

        All this is Brahm =E2=80=94Totality.

        Veda and=
 Upnishadic mantras do remind us we are Amrit Putrah, we have forgotten it =
and learn false progmatism of compromise or stupid intellectualism, recall =
the voice of Veivekananda, Vedic message resonates in his voice, that's the=
 voice of I-ness, glory, confidence and strength,  not the weakness, a real=
ized soul never propogates that what you are continousely propogating - "Th=

op it, it's a non sense, Beware !
         
        Try to understand, beha=
ving like a knower or a Guru without realization has always been harmful to=
 our religion and people's faith, Many a people find such an imitation easy=
, this is the reason India is full of preachers, but it has only a handful =
enlightened seekers.

        When a unrealized person does acting of reali=
zed guru or authoritative signature on religion, he propogates incorrect th=
eories, expansion of such incorrect things suppresses correct things and th=

ust, when you are going to get that ?
         
        You can have bhakti=
, bhakti is great, be a bhakta if that's desirable but try to have an attit=
ude of a Bhakta not the Guru kind Smart Bhakta and then you relish it but l=
