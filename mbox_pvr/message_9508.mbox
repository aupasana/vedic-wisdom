Namaste friends,
=A0
You may find some people who have an unbelievably unca=
nny intuition. They may sometimes seem to "read your mind" and address what=
 you are thinking, without you saying anything. Some of you may even develo=
p such an ability in future. Even if intuition is not good in general, it m=
ay become very good with certain people or certain matters.
=A0
I want to s=
ay a few words about such phenomena and say a few words of caution.
=A0
*=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Some people are more "aw=
are" in their intuition, while some people are not so aware and simply reso=
nate to others' thoughts without awareness.
=A0
As an example, someone I kn=
ow does homam everyday and is a regular and rational person without an imag=
inative/intuitive mind that gets visions, dreams etc.
=A0
Though his sadhan=
a was saattwik (even his visualization of fierce deities was in Upanishadic=
 terms), oneday he felt a strong urge to mix blood in rice and offer it in =
homam. It did not seem natural to him and so he did not act on that instinc=
t though it re-appeared in his mind several times that day. He ignored it a=
s an unnatural thought for him.
=A0
A couple of days later, he received a m=
ail from someone close to him but living 1000s of miles away. This person h=
appened to go to a smashan that weekend night for meditation and saw some T=
antriks doing a
 "Rakta Chamunda" homam. They were offering ingredients dip=
ped in their blood in homam. He just sat there and observed them. He later =
sent a mail about it.
=A0
When the original person received the mail, he re=
alized why he had that thought a couple of days back. His mind was simply r=
esonating to the thoughts of the other person, without a complete awareness=
. In fact, such a thing happened to him several times with the same person.=

=A0
There were also many occasions when he would randomly talk about some =
topic and one specific person in the room would claim that that person was =
thinking about exactly that topic. Again, the question in the mind of that =
person resonated in the other mind and the person started talking about it.=


=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
First, how does t=
his work? Simple - resonance between minds.
=A0
Suppose you are talking lou=
d. You may not hear what others around you are saying. Similarly, if your m=
ind is vibrating with too many thoughts, it may not resonate to the vibrati=
ons in other minds around it.
=A0
But, if you are relatively calm, you can =
hear what others are saying. Similarly, if your mind is relatively calm, it=
 may pick up vibrations in other minds around it (or even 1000s of miles aw=
ay if there is some attachment/connection) and resonate to those vibrations=
!
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Second, how to kn=
ow where the thought is coming from?
=A0
When an infant listens to tens of =
voices, he simply hears different sounds and does not know from which face =
each sound is coming from. Over time, after many observations and correlati=
ons, brain learns to discern from which face each sound is coming from. Lat=
er, one may recognize a voice even when the face is behind a curtain or oth=
erwise invisible!
=A0
Similarly, if one so wishes, one can develop the abil=
ity to discern the source of each thought that vibrates the mind, after muc=
h observation and correlation. The mind can of course be trained. However, =
a seeker of self-realization need not actively pursue such an ability, for =
it serves no useful purpose in Self-realization.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
The ability to 
calm the vibrations in the mi=
nd due to conditioning and then the ability to calm any vibrations due to r=
esonance is more important than the 
ability to discern the source of vibra=
tions.
=A0
Whether a thought that vibrates one's mind right now is coming f=
rom one's own conditioning or sensory observation or someone else's, is not=
 the crux. The crux is knowing whether one should perform any physical/ment=
al *action* based on thought, to fulfill one's swa-dharma, or just observe =
the thought and leave it (move on). A true seeker's focus will be on that a=
bility, i.e. developing clarity regarding one's own dharma, than figuring o=
ut the source of each thought. The latter can be a distraction or even an e=
go trap.
=A0
Nevertheless, Nature may sometimes give one abilities that one=
 does not actively pursue or need (perhaps because one desired it long back=
). A true seeker neither tries for nor resists what is not needed by one. O=
ne does not dwell on it in either case and moves on.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
One may argue that certain special abil=
ities can help one pay off karmik debts on one's way to liberation. However=
, one can (must) trust Nature to arrange for circumstances to pay off one's=
 debts. The key is to be aware of what one can give others in any given cir=
cumstance and give it without holding back. If one gets used to giving with=
out expecting any payback, Nature will automatically arrange for all of one=
's debts to be paid off. No special abilities are needed.
=A0
Of course, wh=
en there is a clash between giving thing X to person A vs giving thing Y to=
 person B, one needs to use one's discretion. That is where our conditionin=
g may block us from the right call. As we know our dharma better and get a =
sense of which of our dharmas are higher, we may start to make the right ca=
lls.
=A0
The bottomline: Try to know your dharma (declared by the spark of =
divinity in heart). Try to follow it to the best of ability. Give whatever =
you can give others, without expecting any payback. Ignore thoughts arising=
 in mind, which do not contribute to fulfillment of your dharma, no matter =
what the source of that thought may be.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Before I sign off, a couple of words on Rakta Chamund=
a from the story above.
=A0
The verb cham means to 
drink/eat/consume. The =
verb mund means to shave or deplete. Chamunda 
means one who drinks and fin=
ishes. Rakta means conditioning or coloring 
(the words rakti (attachment) =
and virakti (detachment) come from the 
same root). Rakta Chamunda is the o=
ne who drinks and empties all 
conditioning that causes desires. Offering b=
lood is an approximation. Also, ironic that some people worship Rakta Chamu=
nda for vashikaran..
=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

 in any given circumstance and give it without holding back. If one gets us=
ed to giving without expecting any payback, Nature will automatically arran=
ge for all of one's debts to be paid off. No special abilities are needed.<=
br> <br>Of course, when there is a clash between giving thing X to per=
son A vs giving
 thing Y to person B, one needs to use one's discretion. Th=
at is where our conditioning may block us from the right call. As we know o=
ur dharma better and get a sense of which of our dharmas are higher, we may=
 start to make the right calls.<br> <br>The bottomline: Try to know yo=
ur dharma (declared by the spark of divinity in heart). Try to follow it to=
 the best of ability. Give whatever you can give others, without expecting =
any payback. Ignore thoughts arising in mind, which do not contribute to fu=
lfillment of your dharma, no matter what the source of that thought may be.=
