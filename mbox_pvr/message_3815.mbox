Namaste,
 
If you see the old mail quoted by Hemanth below, it will answer =
your question.
 
Just because a group of people think something is their dh=
arma and do it does not free them from karma. That may not even really be t=
heir dharma. Knowing one's dharma, as explained below, is very difficult. A=
s one becomes purer, one's dharma becomes clearer to one. The sense of dhar=
ma of a densely conditioned mind is corrupted by that conditioning.
 
Secon=
dly, even doing one's true dharma does not mean one does not incur karma. I=
f Nature selects someone, because of one's prior conditioning and debts, to=
 kill thousand bad people, and one fulfils dharma by killing thousand bad p=
eople, that person WILL incur new karma for it. Dharma (duty) and moksha (l=
iberation) are two different purusharthas and not one. Fulfilling dharma is=
 helpful for liberation, but not sufficient.
 
In addition to doing dharma,=
 one needs to overcome ego (I-ness) and doership. As ego and the sense of d=
oership goes down, the speed at which new karmas are incurred goes down. Dh=
arma becomes clearer. For liberation, one needs to lower ego and the sense =
of doership and do one's dharma (i.e. pay back debts) without attachment an=
d doership.
 
The mail quoted by Hemanth clarifies some key concepts and wo=
rth reading and understanding carefully.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
