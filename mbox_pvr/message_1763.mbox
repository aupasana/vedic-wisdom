Namaste,

At the end of the homam, we call the gods in fire back and thank fire god 
with the mantra "agne naya". After that, it is ok to move the homa kundam 
(and fire) and place it outside in open air or under a kitchen exhaust etc. 
But it is NOT a good idea at all to "extinguish" it. Let the fire run its 
course.

If you use firewood and a lot of materials, fire may take a long time to 
extinguish. But, if you do with dry coconut and ghee mainly, it will be 
extinguish by itself within a few minutes of stopping.

Best regards,
Narasimha
