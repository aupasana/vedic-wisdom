Sir
=C2=A0
I have only one word for what you wrote. Brilliant. Just brillia=
nt. I am sure some day you will write a great book on spiritual topics for =
ordinay humans like me. What you wrote today was possible of one the best p=
ieces I have ever read. 
=C2=A0
I have a friend of mine who is highly inter=
ested in spiritual practises. And he keeps going from one place to another =
in search of sants and sadhus. One day he happened to come across a sadhu, =
who just by looking at him, told him a great many things about his life, so=
me of which no one else could have possibly known. Like how many birth mark=
s were present in his body etc etc. And the sadhu did not even know his nam=
e or even ask him his name. Finally the sadhu told him that he was a vamsha=
j of Markandeya and along what lines will his spiritual progress etc will h=
appen.
=C2=A0
Now I do not know=C2=A0whether this is true, but considering =
that the Sadhu could tell him so much about his life and that my friend is =
by nature one who does sadhana almost daily for years now, I was inclined t=
o believe in it.
=C2=A0
Also I had just re read the Aghora books and theref=
ore I was curious about whether and how a person can pray to Rishi.
=C2=A0
=
Thank you once again for that wonderfully lucid and brilliant post.
=C2=A0

-Regards

=EF=BB=BF 
Namaste,
=C2=A0
There are =
really two different things here.
=C2=A0
Some people are born with=C2=A0an =
amsa (part) of a rishi's consciousness. For example, Ramakrishna Paramahams=
a said that Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was one of the seven great ris=
his. Many people did meet him. Thus, meeting the physical manifestation of =
an amsa of a rishi is not that difficult (though that also requires some pu=
nya).
=C2=A0
The second thing is to meet the physical manifestation of the =
entire consciousness of a rishi. *That* is very very very difficult. As Vim=
alananda said, that may require a terrific amount of tapascharya (unless yo=
u are one of that rishi's people who came to do some work on earth and have=
 already done a terrific amount of tapascharya in past lives).
=C2=A0
*=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
One may wonder: If rishis are so great, why do they not =
get moksha and why do they remain in physical manifestation?
=C2=A0
Though =
the following is essentially like a kindergartener explaining Einstein's th=
eory of general relativity to fellow kindergarteners, I will nevertheless t=
ry to explain it.
=C2=A0
All that our senses perceive is Maya (delusion) th=
at is created by the power of duality. If the veil of delusion is removed, =
there is no duality and all is ONE uniform and undivided consciousness, kno=
wn variously as Aatman or Brahman or Narayana or Sadashiva. This one unifor=
m and undivided consciousness is known as "unmanifested Brahman". The world=
 of duality, where there are many different objects, is also actually Brahm=
an only, but Brahman that went through some modification and manifestation.=
 It is known as "manifested Brahman". Both are Brahman only.
=C2=A0
Normall=
y, living in the domain of duality without being deluded by some aspect of =
duality or the other is near to impossible. Remaining in duality with a per=
fect understanding of the underlying oneness of all objects and perceiving =
all those objects of duality without experiencing attraction or repulsion f=
or any single object of duality is almost impossible. Most spiritual aspira=
nts try to reach the state of oneness with unmanifested Brahman - a state i=
n which there is no duality and no objectification - and become absorbed in=
 that state forever. That is the advaitic experience of "nirvikalpa samadhi=
" and what happens in "moksha".
=C2=A0
However, maharshis have described hi=
gher states. It is possible to be in oneness with manifested Brahman and un=
manifested Brahman at the same time. It is possible to remain in duality, w=
ith the senses perceiving objects of duality, and yet remain in oneness wit=
h the underlying oneness (Brahman) of all obejcts and not be deluded, i.e. =
not experience either attraction or repulsion for any object of duality. Me=
re perception of objects by the senses is not the problem. The tendency of =
mind to be find some attractive and find some repulsive is the problem. It =
is possible to remain in a state where there is neither attraction nor repu=
lsion for any object is possible.
=C2=A0
Such a state is experienced by ver=
y few beings. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Shirdi Sai Baba etc were in this sta=
te always. Swami Vivekananda also experienced it.
=C2=A0
Rishis are beings =
who are always in a very high state. They are always alert to the maya and =
yet not stuck in it. They perceive objects of duality and yet are not attra=
cted or repelled by anything. If one overcomes attraction and repulsion and=
 yet remains in duality, one can pretty much do anything. But because one i=
s neither attracted or repelled by anything, it means one has no personal e=
go and one has no reason to do anything for personal ego. Then one becomes =
an instrument of nature (Prakriti) and implements the wish of nature throug=
h one's actions, which are performed without any attachment or personal ide=
ntification. One who has a personal=C2=A0ego can do limited things. One who=
 has a very very small ego can do great things. One who has no ego can do A=
NY thing. But such a being does things that are desired by Nature - the nat=
ural order of the universe. They can change the course of history of nation=
s and planets.
=C2=A0
A rishi in this state may engage in various actions o=
f great consequence for the world. Yet, there is no attachment with the act=
ions. He is just an unattached instrument of Nature.
=C2=A0
If one gets out=
 of the duality and becomes absorbed in unmanifested Brahman forever, one i=
s not born again. But a rishi who has an equal vision of unmanifested and m=
anifested Brahman is for ever mukta (liberated). Thus, he will freely inter=
act with duality without any fear or aversion. Amsa of such a rishi may eve=
n be born again as a separate person, just as a process running in a comput=
er may spawn off a separate thread to do some focussed task. Even if the co=
mputer process has finished all the initialization and early work, the newl=
y spawned thread has to go through initialization etc again. Similarly, the=
 person born with amsa has to go through the process of overcoming weakness=
es and realizing self all over=C2=A0again. When a Vivekananda is born from =
the amsa of a rishi, he may have to struggle initially and overcome the wea=
knesses and realize self all over again. But he is the amsa of an ever free=
 and liberated being and will find his way again.
=C2=A0
Thus, a liberated =
rishi, with the force of his liberated consciousness and with the force of =
his reborn amsas, will act as an unattached instrument of Nature performing=
 actions of tremendous consequences without any personal ego driving those =
actions.
=C2=A0

*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Worshipping the rishi of one's gotr=
a and getting his blessings is a very good idea. In general, getting the bl=
essings of ANY rishi is a great idea. Pursuing the rishi of one's gotra is =
relatively easier for most people. But, if one has a connection with a spec=
ific rishi (apart from the rishi of one's gotra), one can worship that rish=
i. However, it is not easy to know that.
=C2=A0
Suppose several mantras you=
 find natural attraction for have the descendants of a specific Maharshi as=
 the rishi. Then you may have a connection with that Maharshi. You can try =
praying to him.
=C2=A0

Dear Narasimhaji
=C2=A0
I had a=
 question about Rishis. In the Aghora books, it is mentioned that the Rishi=
s of yesteryears are still alive and roam around in this planet. There are =
signs on their body.And that only some who has done terrific amount of tapa=

your thoughts on this topic. I am really curious..

Dear=
 Prasad,
=C2=A0
I do not know any specific mantra. I know many mantras for =
which Kashyapa is rishi, but no mantra to pray to Kashyapa himself.
=C2=A0
=
There are many mantras for Prajapati in general ("prajaapate na tvadetaanya=
nyo. .."), but I don't know a mantra specifically to worship Kashyapa.
=C2=

If you perform a homam, you can add the following line after the poorva=
angam (initial five aahutis) and before the uttarangam.
=C2=A0
Om kashyapaa=
ya swaahaa. kashyapaayedam na mama.
=C2=A0
Say it and make an offering of=
=C2=A0ghee for Kashyapa.
=C2=A0
Another way to worship a rishi is to take s=
ection of Veda for which he is the rishi and try to experience that section=
. You can simply pick one rik for which Kashyapa is rishi and keep meditati=
ng on that rik. You can close your eyes, keep back straight and repeat the =
rik mentally with swaram without moving and do that everyday for a certain =
amount of time. Oneday the rishi may be pleased with you and you may experi=
ence something.

<DIV>I had a questi=
on about Rishis. In the Aghora books, it is mentioned that the Rishis of ye=
steryears are still alive and roam around in this planet. There are signs o=
n their body.And that only some who has done terrific amount of tapashya is=
 eligible to meet a Rishi. And also that praying to Rishi of ones gotra can=
 help to acclerate ones spirtual progress. Kindly enlighten us with your th=
oughts on this topic. I am really curious..</DIV>
