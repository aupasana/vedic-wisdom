Are you suggesting then that, the highest truth, the source of everything, =
the ever existing Brahman is Shakti (Energy)?

      Namaste,

 
=

Let me try to put it in simple words. I hope members know basic physics to=
 understand this analogy.

 

Purusha (also known as Narayana or SadaShiva)=
 is essentially the *potential* energy of this entire universe, while Prakr=
iti (also known as Narayani or AadiShakti) is essentially the *kinetic* ene=
rgy of this entire universe.

 

That way, Purusha and Prakriti are not ess=
entially different and are interchangable, but they do play different roles=
.

 

Best regards,

Narasimha
