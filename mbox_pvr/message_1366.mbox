Dear Narsimhaji,
I am glad to know this and perhaps I will be the lucky per=
son to start the first center in India. Money is no problem when Jagdamba i=
s with me. I will be happy to be the instrument in this great devine missio=
n. First I will start this at the place near Dwarka. This is the extreme we=
st coast of India.. I have stayed there for 7 years and good contacts are t=
here. It may be at Okha port or Near Harsiddhi temple near Dwarka or near G=
opnath (?) one of the Dwadash Jyotirlingam near Dwarka. You just pray for m=
e and also tell Manishji also to bless me so that I can succeed. Next I wil=
l think for Ujjain..

=EF=BB=BF 
Namaste Ashwin=
 ji,
=C2=A0
My guru's idea is to start=C2=A0four such centers in east, west=
, north and=C2=A0south parts of India and then=C2=A0establish one in Ujjain=
.
=C2=A0
The idea with each center is as following: It should be in some pe=
aceful and calm place that is easily accessible by modern transportation an=
d yet a little away from the hustle and bustle of modern life. There need n=
ot be a big or famous temple nearby. Buy a few acres of land (for possible =
expansion in future) and construct a homa kundam built in open space with f=
our pillars on the four sides and a high roof on the top to protect from ra=
in. The area is open on all the four sides and covered only on the top. Clo=
se to it, a small one or two room structure is built to store materials.
=
=C2=A0
A priest or a sadhaka is employed. His main qualification is that he=
 should be a sincere devotee of the Mother and interested in a simple lifes=
tyle dedicated to Her. His job is to do one Chandi homam in the morning, on=
e more in forenoon, have lunch, relax in the afternoon and do one more Chan=
di homam in the evening. Keep doing it day in and day out. There are no ido=
ls to worship and no other rituals to do.
=C2=A0
This=C2=A0will pretty much=
 take up all his time and hence enough money should be arranged to take car=
e of the priest and his family. If the priest is not well-versed in homam o=
r Chandi homam, that is no problem. He can be trained. But, the most import=
ant thing is that he should be committed to this and devoted to the Mother.=
 If one has the basic simplicity, innocence, devotion=C2=A0and purity, othe=
r things will fall in place by themselves.
=C2=A0
Buying of the land and co=
nstruction of room and homa kundam (with roof and pillars) is a one-time ex=
pense. Salary of the priest and materials like ghee, wood etc for homam are=
 an ongoing expense. This project requires a good amount of money and energ=
y.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
After a center is established and sadhana=
 progresses in each center, slowly the presence of Mother will be establish=
ed there. Once that happens, the sadhaka will start making faster progress.=
 As he becomes purer and purere, the sadhana will generate more and more en=
ergy.
=C2=A0
After establishing 4 other centers, a center in Ujjain is to b=
e started. The sadhana being done at the Chandi homam centers will have a c=
atalytic influence on the homam movement and many many people will start do=
ing different kinds of homas around the world. This will have a major impac=
t on dharma in the world. That is what he was told.

=
=C2=A0
I did not want to force or impose on anybody. So this has waited. Wh=
en the time comes, people who will make this happen will come and take char=
ge.
=C2=A0
Time has probably not yet come for Ujjain. But if there is a vil=
lage in Gujarat or Maharashtra where you can do this, please consider. But =
please realize that this requires money commitment and also a committed sad=
haka.

Narasimha

The only specific name mentioned was Ujjain. Others were not mention=

As I said, these things require resources. But if t=

am confident that She will show the direction when time comes. Until then, =

No, =
we have not yet acted on that instruction. I am pleased that some other peo=

Namaste friends,

Shree Maa was referre=
d to here. Someone sent me a few snippets from an 
interview posted on her =
website. Please see below.

It is interesting that she considers Ramakrishn=
a Paramahamsa as her guru. It 
is interesting that Ramakrishna told her she=
 had to "do fire ceremonies and 
show what is truth" and "at that time the =
whole world will be peace". This 
is similar to what my guru was told by Di=
vine Mother when she appeared to 
him during Shata Chandi homam at Chennai.=


She told him that many people are and will be born who will perform a sho=
rt 
fire ritual on a regular basis, establish sanatana dharma and peace in =
the 
world and also make quick spiritual progress individually in that proc=
ess. 
Shree Maa's statement about what Ramakrishna told her is along simila=
r 
lines.

My guru was also told by Mother that a few centres of regular Ch=
andi homam 
should be established around the world, where Chandi homam is d=
one 3 times a 
day. These places do not need to be near any temples or famo=
us places and 
can be anywhere. The ritual need not be elaborate. For examp=
le, there is no 
need to offer silk sarees etc in fire. A simple ritual wit=
h bare minimum 
offerings is enough, but it needs to be performed 3 times e=
veryday. When a 
few such centres are established, it will apparently lead =
to a chain of 
events that will help re-establish sanatana dharma.

Though =
not 3 times a day, these people have done a Chandi homam everyday for 
3 ye=
ars in the same place and finished 1000 such homas. That is fantastic! 
It =
is the sadhana and purity of sadhakas that creates energy and brings 
deiti=
es to a place. While several ancient temples are without any divine 
presen=
ce these days, new places of divine presence may be created by pure 
souls =
engaged in selfless sadhana for establishing dharma in the world.

As I men=
tioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Shata Chandi homam during which 
Mother=
 appeared and gave instructions to my guru on spreading homam was 
taken on=
 Ramakrishna' s birth anniversary and the time of sankalpa was within 
a fe=
w minutes from the actual Tithi Pravesha time of the birth anniversary. 
Al=
l of this was a coincidence and we were unaware of this significance when 
=
we decided the muhurta. It is interesting to know that Ramakrishna did 
men=
tion fire ceremonies specifically to somebody and that his words are 
simil=
ar to the words of Mother.

Best regards,
Narasimha

<DIV>Namaste friends,<BR><BR>Shree M=
aa was referred to here. Someone sent me a few snippets from an <BR>intervi=
ew posted on her website. Please see below.<BR><BR>It is interesting that s=
he considers Ramakrishna Paramahamsa as her guru. It <BR>is interesting tha=
t Ramakrishna told her she had to "do fire ceremonies and <BR>show what is =
truth" and "at that time the whole world will be peace". This <BR>is simila=
r to what my guru was told by Divine Mother when she appeared to <BR>him du=
ring Shata Chandi homam at Chennai.<BR><BR>She told him that many people ar=
e and will be born who will perform a short <BR>fire ritual on a regular ba=
sis, establish sanatana dharma and peace in the <BR>world and also make qui=
ck spiritual progress individually in that process. <BR>Shree Maa's stateme=
nt about what Ramakrishna told her is along similar <BR>lines.<BR><BR>My gu=
ru was also told by Mother that a few centres of regular Chandi homam <BR>s=
hould be established around the
 world, where Chandi homam is done 3 times =
a <BR>day. These places do not need to be near any temples or famous places=
 and <BR>can be anywhere. The ritual need not be elaborate. For example, th=
ere is no <BR>need to offer silk sarees etc in fire. A simple ritual with b=
are minimum <BR>offerings is enough, but it needs to be performed 3 times e=
veryday. When a <BR>few such centres are established, it will apparently le=
ad to a chain of <BR>events that will help re-establish sanatana dharma.<BR=
><BR>Though not 3 times a day, these people have done a Chandi homam everyd=
ay for <BR>3 years in the same place and finished 1000 such homas. That is =
fantastic! <BR>It is the sadhana and purity of sadhakas that creates energy=
 and brings <BR>deities to a place. While several ancient temples are witho=
ut any divine <BR>presence these days, new places of divine presence may be=
 created by pure <BR>souls engaged in selfless sadhana for establishing dha=
rma in the
 world.<BR><BR>As I mentioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Shata=
 Chandi homam during which <BR>Mother appeared and gave instructions to my =
guru on spreading homam was <BR>taken on Ramakrishna' s birth anniversary a=
nd the time of sankalpa was within <BR>a few minutes from the actual Tithi =
Pravesha time of the birth anniversary. <BR>All of this was a coincidence a=
nd we were unaware of this significance when <BR>we decided the muhurta. It=
 is interesting to know that Ramakrishna did <BR>mention fire ceremonies sp=
ecifically to somebody and that his words are <BR>similar to the words of M=
other.<BR><BR>Best regards,<BR>Narasimha<BR>------------ --------- --------=
