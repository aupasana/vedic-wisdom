Dear Narasmiha
=C2=A0
I was wondering, does doing homa for different deitie=
s have different kind of effects. Like if someone does a Mahaganapati Homa =
vs someone doing a Homa of Krishna for a considerable period of time, is th=
ere any set principle that defines what kind of progress or experiences eac=
h may undergo?
=C2=A0
I know that it may all depend on the specific persons=
 karmas and mental makeup acquired over many lifetimes, but can there be a =
broad generalization done on this?
=C2=A0
-Regards
=C2=A0Rajarshi

Namaste,

It is f=
ar better to stick to one deity and one homam and do it every 
day/week/for=
tnight/ month for a duration of time. It is a bad idea to do a 
different h=
omam everyday.

Ramakrishna Paramahamsa used to say "if you want, dig deep =
in one place. 
Don't dig one foot in one place, another foot in another pla=
ce and so on".

Pick one deity and one homam and do it continuously for a f=
ew months 
atleast. It will do something then.

Amavasya is good for worshi=
pping Kaali or Mahalakshmi. Especially 
Deepavali/Diwali is a great day to =
worship Mahalakshmi. So Her homam is a 
good idea.

Best regards,
Narasimha=
