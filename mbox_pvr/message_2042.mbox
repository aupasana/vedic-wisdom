Namaste,
 
(a) Correct. It is fine to work hard like a honeybee, be engross=
ed in material life and feel many happinesses and sadnesses of life. The on=
ly thing missed out is self-realization and moksha.
 
(b) Not exactly. Spir=
itual progress does not mean shunning material things. Some people leave wi=
fe, children, house, car etc and live in forest, in an attempt to get contr=
ol over the mind and remove the attachment to and dependency on those thing=
s. However, it is not necessary. One can remove the dependency on all thing=
s that surround one, even as one remains in their middle! Staying away from=
 something is neither necessary nor sufficient to overcome attachment. What=
 things and people are around you and what actions you engage in are not th=
e problem that blocks you from moksha. It is how you look at them and with =
what frame of mind you engage in the actions that are the blockages. So the=
 problem is not the material world around you, but your own mind that is th=
e problem. Detachment does not mean not loving or not engaging in actions. =
Detachment means loving but without expectations and engaging in actions bu=
t without expectations.
 
If you give love and do not expect anything in re=
turn, if you put in your best effort towards what you see as your dharma fo=
r people around you and do not worry about things that go wrong, if you foc=
us on the present and engage in the best possible actions without too much =
of worry or anxiety about past or future, can there be anything more effect=
ive or efficient than that?
 
If one is like a drop of water on a lotus lea=
f and engages in actions without attachment, one is not necessarily a failu=
re materially. Such a person will do everything a person with deep attachme=
nts does, but only better! I say better, because a detached person does not=
 waste time worrying about things out of one's hand or things that went wro=
ng. A detached person always focuses on the best action to engage in right =
now and does it.
 
Let me put this in one sentence: Attachment does not mak=
e you more effective or efficient. In fact, if anything, attachment makes y=
ou less effective and efficient. If you are detached, you will give uncondi=
tionally and engage in actions without any energy being dispersed on worryi=
ng over things out of your control. Normal people waste a lot of their time=
, energy and emotional space, worrying about things they cannot control. A =
detached person does what is in one's control perfectly and accepts the res=
ult whole-heartedly.
 
(c) If you are a jeevanmukta, you will do everything=
 you see as your dharma, but only better. You will not feel happy or sad or=
 jealous and angry etc. Your mind will be in a stable, peaceful and blissfu=
l state always. It is worth it. You are not getting out of anything, but pu=
tting in the best effort.
 
(e) Yes, do not think of emancipation or libera=
tion. Think one small step at a time. Think of getting some physical and me=
ntal discipline. Think of some minor control over mind. Thinking overcoming=
 minor weaknesses. Start slowly.
 
(f) There are many ways. The specific wa=
y using which many people will benefit in the next few centuries and the sp=
ecific way which I am here to teach is "homam" or fire ritual. When you are=
 with a person, the physical vibrations made by the person's lips can be he=
ard physically by your ears. Similarly, the vibrations made by his subtle b=
ody and mind can be "heard" by your subtle body and mind. That is why we fe=
el pleasant when we are with great saints and uneasy in some companies. The=
 vibrations produced by the subtle and causal bodies of people around us do=
 have an impact on us. Fire is one powerful object which has very pleasant,=
 powerful and cleansing vibrations at the subtle and causal levels. Being n=
ext to fire of a reasonable size is like being with a great yogi.
 
If one =
does a 20-40 min Mahaganapathi homam everyday for 2-3 years, things will au=
tomatically start to fall in place.
 
The problem you are seeking is your m=
ind. The solution is also in your mind. You use your mind to train mind to =
let go of its weaknesses and attachments one by one.
 
Best regards,
Narasi=
mha

sdom] Re: Descent of the Supramenal Conscinousness


  Dear Narasimha,

  V=
ery good article/discussion..Thanks for sharing it.

  If I can, Let me als=
o ask some basic questions. (I am very new to all this. Search for some ans=
wers has brought me to this forum.) 

  a) Why Madhukaitam is  so bad/evil?=
 Is it not that the world is being sustained by people keeping their head d=
own and doing the routine work? Do we not please the God by keeping our hea=
d down and playing the role assigned to us ? An obvious answer comes to min=
d is that it will keep us away from emancipation and/self-actualization. Co=
rrect/Incorrect? 

  b) So,  Is spirituality and materialism two poles apar=
t (and twain shall never meet..). Say I wd like to reach the heights of pro=
fessional success in my career, Am I doomed not to become a good spirituali=
st (???)? or, If I want to become self-actualized by 2025, does it mean I s=
hould stop planning to climb the professional ladder? I do understand about=
 "Limited Bandwidth" issue - but, then I also read about King Janak. Can I =
combine these two - if yes, how?

  c) Getting even more confused now,  Why=
 do we say that emancipation is our spiritual goal. If GOD created us, and =
put us on this stage - should our goal not be to play the role dutifully, w=
hich God wants us to play. By seeking for emancipation, are we trying to ge=
t off the stage and trying to escape the role assigned to us. Are we not co=
ntradicting the God's scheme of things by trying to get out of the scheme? =


  d) Or, Is it part of God's scheme to put us in this "maya" first and th=
en ask us to get out of the "maya"? Why will he do so? I am sure he will no=
t be playing "rats in the maze" game. Then, why??

  e) Sometimes, I also t=
hink that all these above questions are meaningless. I look at my pre-schoo=
l kid and the way she has put her faith in her teacher. She is not worrying=
 about her profession or phd thesis right now. Similarly, probably, Emancip=
ation/Merger in Cosmic soul etc are problems that we should not be thinking=
 at the begining of our spiritual journey - just look to learn/experience m=
ore till we are ready (for what?)

  f) Then, what do we mean by spiritual =
journey? where/how do we start? I thought about doing homam/reciting mantra=
 - but is that the right way? or there is another way. Probably, there are =
many ways - then how do I choose my way? An "user guide" or " spirituality =
for dummies" book  would have been useful. Do we have one?

  I will apprec=
iate if you can take some time out to guide me here. In fact, probably, I d=
onot even have the right question right now - forget about articulating the=
m well and seeking the answer (I am seeking the problem :))

  Namaste Rajarshi,

  The non-dual Aatman or Brahman is the =

  Please see the "many faced diamond" analogy for god at the end of htt=
p://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/1 to get clarity on why dif=
ferent people give different hierarchies and consider different beings as s=

  The duality is s=

us, the hierarchy within hierarchy will have to start at the connection wit=

  There is no causal relationship between th=
e two. Actions of rishis and the will of the supreme cosmic being are in sy=
nc. They just happen together. Neither causes the other.

  Rishis are the =
most perfected beings without a trace of ego and yet performing actions of =
great consequence, with zero attachment. They operate right on the border o=
f duality and non-duality.

  Our ego does not leave us even in sadhana. Sometimes, one's belief=
 that one's guru is the best guru or the god one prays to is the supreme on=
e is rooted in one'e ego and one's need to be the best and be associated wi=
th the best. Just contemplate if that is the case and if it is, try to root=
 out such thinking.

  Having said that, do look at the god you pray to as =
the supreme and try to reach the supreme through him/her by surrendering to=
 him/her. If you take a low level manifestation of that deity, then rishis =
may indeed be beyond him/her as Vimalananda said. But, if you take the high=
est manifestation of the deity, as the supreme cosmic being, then rishis ar=
e his playmates and neither above nor below.

  *        *        *

  If y=
ou take a company, there may be a chairman who may be the highest authority=
. But, it may be a ceremonial role and some may consider CEO to be higher w=
hile some may consider the chairman to be higher. Why bother about who is h=
igher? In a company does well, they both work with understanding.

  The hi=
erarchy is irrelevant to one who is a clerk at the company. Just follow the=
 order of your boss (guru) instead of wondering whether chairman calls the =
shots or CEO.

  Narasimha

  =
        I have a question. Though it will probably sound stupid to a learne=

ght of putting this question in this forum.

          You mentioned that a=
 senior Maharishi is doing this. In the books of Vimalananda he says Naths,=
 Munis and Rishis are higher beings, even higher than deities.

          W=
hat confuses me is that, what can be higher than a deity? For example Godde=

ing be higher than Her? Or lord Shiva or Narayana?

          I mean is it =
the Rishi who is acting our the Mother's instructions or is it She who is c=
reating the environment for the Rishi's wish to come true? Which one came f=
irst?

          It gets confusing-:(. 

          As a devotee it is natur=
al and simple to believe that the God I pray to is the Ultimate Supreme aut=
hority, but when I hear that Rishis are even beyond this, then doubt creeps=
 in, is the deity therefore not as supreme as is made out to be?

            Namaste,

            Aurobindo need not be talking abo=
ut a single "savior" the way people may imagine. Also, he need not be talki=
ng about somebody "connected to" his ashram. Moreover, when it comes to gre=
at lineages, there are connections between all. For example, Aurobindo used=
 to visit the house of Sister Nivedita, the foremost disciple of Swami Vive=
kananda and knew her well when he still lived in Calcutta. He had a vision =
in his prison cell of Swami Vivekananda, just a few years after his death, =
in which he imparted Aurobindo some key knowledge. Paramahamsa Yogananda gr=
ew up in Calcutta and learnt Sanskrit from M, who was a sishya of Ramakrish=
na and wrote the gospel of Ramakrishna. Trilinga Swami sent a tantra teache=
r to Ramakrishna to expand his knowledge. Trilinga Swami knew Lahiri mahash=
aya and admired him. And so on.

            Coming back to the main point,=
 the supermind established in the field of earth that was referred to by Au=
robindo can simply be a maharshi paying some attention to matters on earth.=
 A maharshi absorbed in the divine in one of the higher planes of conscious=
ness can accomplish huge changes on earth by the mere power of his thought.=
 If there is a divine play to make some positive changes on earth and a mah=
arshi takes part in the play, he may focus a small part of his supermind on=
 the affairs of earth and direct a few important souls to do some key work.=
 Some important souls (deities, rishis or yogis etc) may send their amshas =
(partial essence) to be born on earth to fulfil different parts of a divine=
 play.

            You may then see several (not just one) elevated beings=
, enlightened beings and realized beings born on earth to bring clarity in =
different aspects of spiritual knowledge. Each of them will get specific in=
ternal/external guidance from the divine, based on what their part in the p=
lay is.

            *        *        *

            The "Asura of Falseho=
od" that Aurobindo alluded to is all around us. At the subtlest level, he m=
anifests as false ego in pretty much everybody. At the grossest level, he m=
anifests as blatant lies, wrong propaganda etc.

            One should not=
 tolerate this Asura (demon) and fight hard. However, one should not hate t=
his Asura or those afflicted by him. When we encounter lies, we should figh=
t and stand for truth but not hate the liar at the same time. There is noth=
ing that needs to be hated in this world. One should learn to do the job as=
signed to one by Nature without attraction or repulsion to anything or anyb=
ody and with unconditional love (i.e. no expectations of a return) to all.

            > This was a very interesting read and matches what Narasimhaj=

            I know=
 very little. But I was told that an age that is somewhat like the bygone a=
ges will be established on earth for a few hundred years in the coming deca=
des. The reason the Divine Mother appeared before Manish and asked him to s=
pread simple homam procedures in the world was to prepare the grounds for t=
hat. Manish also told me that all this is the play of a senior maharshi.

                            I found an interes=

one interested.

                            Near the beginning of the 20th=
 century the great Indian freedom fighter and yogi-sage, Sri Aurobindo, beg=
an to express a truth which had not been expressed before. In his high stat=
es of divine union he saw that the time had come for a new stage in the evo=
lution of mankind. He saw that the divine was to manifest right here on Ear=
th and that the time for this divine emergence into Earth life was now. He =
spoke of heaven descending to Earth, even as Earth experienced a breakdown =
due to the intrinsic resistance held within her material body towards this =
=EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD
                            =EF=BF=BD
          =
                  Sri Aurobindo was joined in Pondicherry, India, by a Fren=
ch mystic, Mirra Alfassa, who later became known as the Mother. Together th=
ey embarked on a journey of intensive cellular transformation that is very =
relevant to the colossal uncertainties we face today.
                     =
       =EF=BF=BD
                            Sri Aurobindo saw that the div=
ine force permeates all matter, and that all matter therefore has a force o=
f consciousness. The process of the divine spirit descending down into matt=
er is called involution. The process by which the divine ascends back upwar=
ds out of matter is called evolution. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity =
has reached a stage where these two events are occurring simultaneously, an=
d in his inner visions, he foresaw that we would soon be experiencing a des=
cent of what he called =EF=BF=BDsupramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=
=BF=BD that would entirely change everything on Earth.
                    =
        =EF=BF=BD
                            Man=EF=BF=BDs greatness is no=
t in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in what he makes possible. An immo=
rtal soul is somewhere within him, even if seldom active in most people, wh=
ile an eternal spirit overshadows him, even if obstructed from descent by t=
he hard lid of his constructed personality. There is a great divine plan in=
 motion, even if the evidence of the outer senses seems to contradict it.

=
                            Sri Aurobindo recognized that humankind is goin=
g through an evolutionary crisis. A stage has been reached in which the hum=
an mind has made tremendous strides on the one hand, but is left hopelessly=
 inadequate to prevent its own extinction as a species. Meanwhile, as the M=
other testified before her death in 1973, a consciousness higher than the h=
uman rational mind, what may be termed the Supermind, has recently been est=
ablished in the fields of the Earth, and is active there. Our task now is t=
o bring it down into cellular consciousness.

                            E=
volution took a great leap forward with the origins of Life, and later with=
 the emergence of Mind. We are now at the threshold of another leap forward=
, even more momentous, as we prepare for the emergence of the Supermind. Sr=
i Aurobindo speaks about four stages of human evolution, which we will soon=
 be starting to experience concurrently upon Earth. The first is =EF=BF=BDa=
nimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current species, a rational being possessing an i=
ndividualized soul, but largely obstructed from contacting and merging with=
 it.
                            =EF=BF=BD
                            Next=
 is the =EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a species that is spontaneous- ly co=
ming to birth under the influence of an ever-expanding supramental field, a=
 being that is largely able to merge and live from soul-consciousness rathe=
r than mind-consciousness. 

                            Thirdly is the =EF=
=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still inhabit a dense physical body, but w=
ill be in possession of the Mind of Light, which is supramental consciousne=
ss that has begun to merge with cellular consciousness. 

                 =
           Finally, our ultimate goal as a species is the =EF=BF=BDSupramen=
tal Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity incarnated fully within the subtle realms of m=
atter. This will be a race of what we could call =EF=BF=BDDescended Masters=
.=EF=BF=BD In this species, the unity of matter and spirit would be fully r=
ealized upon Earth.

                            The great work of Sri Auro=
bindo and the Mother was in bringing supramental consciousness down into th=
e cellular consciousness of their own bodies. Since this is a unified consc=
iousness, this meant that the supramental consciousness was simultaneously =
being brought into the consciousness fields of the Earth, awaiting the mome=
nt when it would flower into its full manifestation in collective matter.
 =
                           Whenever there is a =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD th=
ere is corresponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo and the Mother speak of thei=
r experience with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD essentially anti-divin=
e forces, at work in the world today. There is the Asura of Darkness, the A=
sura of Suffering, The Asura of Falsehood, and the Asura of Death. These ar=
e the forces that are so outwardly apparent, and which seem to be in contro=
l of current global events. According to them the Asura of Darkness (Lucife=
r?) has gone through a transformation recently, and the Asura of Suffering =
has returned to Source, and so only the latter two still remain to wreak ha=
voc on Earth. Interestingly, they spoke of the Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BD=
channeling=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during World War II, and of their own in=
tensive inner work in countering his influence. It would not be difficult t=
o see how this same Asura may be influencing other world leaders in the cur=
rent political sphere.

                            With the descent of thi=
s new vibratory consciousness all our old obsolete human structures will be=
 demolished. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that although the changes wi=
ll be enormous they would not be necessarily catastrophic. The power of Tru=
th automatically erases Falsehood, and our world for the most part consists=
 of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, he maintained, carried a power of harm=
onization which could overcome this resistance by means other than dramatic=
 struggle and violence. The Asuras will eventually be absorbed into their o=
riginal emanations of Light, Life, Beauty, and Truth. It may be interesting=
 to speculate, with all the violence in the world today, the destruction we=
 might have experienced if not for this power of harmonization!

          =
                  When does all this happen? Sri Aurobindo and the Mother b=
elieved that the world stage was set for this quantum descent, and that it =
was quite imminent. The Mother said in 1968 that the supramental transforma=
tion was a certainty now, and that it would come about with a minimum of de=
struction, =EF=BF=BDalthough this minimum is still considerable.=EF=BF=BD S=
he said that the year 2000 would be a turning point.

                     =
       This was a very interesting read and matches what Narasimhaji says a=
bout changes coming in the world.

  <DIV>Dear Narasimha,</DIV>
  <DIV><FONT face=3DAri=
al size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
  <DIV>Very good article/discussion..Thanks=
 for sharing it.</DIV>
  <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DI=
V>
  <DIV>If I can, Let me also ask some basic questions. (I am very new to=
 all 
  this. Search for some answers has brought me to this forum.) </DIV>=

  <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
  <DIV>a) Why Madhu=
kaitam is  so bad/evil? Is it not that the world is 
  being sustained=
 by people keeping their head down and doing the routine work? 
  Do we not=
 please the God by keeping our head down and playing the role 
  assigned t=
o us ? An obvious answer comes to mind is that it will keep us away 
  from=
 emancipation and/self-actualization. Correct/Incorrect? </DIV>
  <DIV><FON=
T face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
  <DIV>b) So,  Is spiritua=
lity and materialism two poles apart (and twain 
  shall never meet..). Say=
 I wd like to reach the heights of professional 
  success in my career, Am=
 I doomed not to become a good spiritualist (???)? or, 
  If I want to beco=
me self-actualized by 2025, does it mean I should stop 
  planning to climb=
 the professional ladder? I do understand about "Limited 
  Bandwidth" issu=
e - but, then I also read about King Janak. Can I combine these 
  two - if=
 yes, how?</DIV>
  <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
  <=
DIV>
  <DIV>c) Getting even more confused now,  Why do we say that ema=
ncipation 
  is our spiritual goal. If GOD created us, and put us on t=
his stage - 
  should our goal not be to play the role dutifully, which God=
 wants us to play. 
  By seeking for emancipation, are we trying to get off=
 the stage and trying to 
  escape the role assigned to us. Are we not cont=
radicting the God's scheme of 
  things by trying to get out of the scheme?=
 </DIV>
  <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
  <DIV>d) Or=
, Is it part of God's scheme to put us in this "maya" first and then 
  ask=
 us to get out of the "maya"? Why will he do so? I am sure he will not be 
=
  playing "rats in the maze" game. Then, why??</DIV>
  <DIV><FONT face=
=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
  <DIV>e) Sometimes, I also think tha=
t all these above questions are 
  meaningless. I look at my pre-school kid=
 and the way she has put her faith in 
  her teacher. She is not worrying a=
bout her profession or phd thesis right now. 
  Similarly, probably, E=
mancipation/Merger in Cosmic soul etc are problems 
  that we should not be=
 thinking at the begining of our spiritual journey - just 
  look to learn/=
experience more till we are ready (for what?)</DIV>
  <DIV><FONT face=3DAri=
al size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
  <DIV>f) Then, what do we mean by spiritua=
l journey? where/how do we start? I 
  thought about doing homam/reciting m=
antra - but is that the right way? or 
  there is another way. Probably, th=
ere are many ways - then how do I choose my 
  way? An "user guide" or " sp=
irituality for dummies" book  would have been 
  useful. Do we have on=
e?</DIV>
  <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
  <DIV>I wi=
ll appreciate if you can take some time out to guide me here. In 
  fact, p=
robably, I donot even have the right question right now - forget about 
  a=
rticulating them well and seeking the answer (I am seeking the problem 
  :=
))</DIV>

          <DIV>I have a question. Tho=
ugh it will probably sound stupid to a 
          learned man like you, but=
 I just could not get a convincing answer to 
          it, so thought of p=
utting this question in this forum.</DIV>
          <DIV><FONT face=3DArial=
 size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
          <DIV>You mentioned that a seni=
or Maharishi is doing this. In 
          the books of Vimalananda he =
says Naths, Munis and Rishis are higher 
          beings, even higher than=
 deities.</DIV>
          <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </D=
IV>
          <DIV>What confuses me is that, what can be higher than a deit=
y? For 
          example Goddes Durga is the supreme mother of all worlds,=
 then how can 
          a Rishi or any being be higher than Her? Or lord S=
hiva or 
          Narayana?</DIV>
          <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=
=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
          <DIV>I mean is it the Rishi who is actin=
g our the Mother's 
          instructions or is it She who is creating the=
 environment for the 
          Rishi's wish to come true? Which one came f=
irst?</DIV>
          <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
=
          <DIV>It gets confusing-:(. </DIV>
          <DIV><FONT face=3DAri=

          <DIV>As a devotee it is natural a=
nd simple to believe that the God I 
          pray to is the Ultimate Supr=
eme authority, but when I hear that Rishis 
          are even beyond this,=
 then doubt creeps in, is the deity therefore not 
          as supreme as =
is made out to be?</DIV>
          <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT>=
 </DIV>
          <DIV>Sorry if these questions seem childish, but I r=
