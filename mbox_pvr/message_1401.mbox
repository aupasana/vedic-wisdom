Take=
 a sankalpa to do Vighneshwara pooja. Invoke Vighneshwara in an idol 

made=
 with turmeric paste. Do a shodasopachaara pooja to Vighneshwara. Then 

ta=
ke a sankalpa to do the main homam (e.g. Mahaganapathi homam). Call back 

=
Vighneshwara. Invoke Varuna in kalasha with "imam me" and "tattvaayaami" 

=
mantras (veda mantras). Do shodasopachaara pooja to Varuna. Then read 

Pun=
yaahavaachanam (Pavamaana sooktam). Call back Varuna and sprinkle a bit 

o=
f kalasha water all around.



Then start the fire. There are few additiona=
l procedures including the 

invocation of Brahma and Varuna in small water=
 bowls with darbhas on then 

and quick pooja to them with akshatas. After =
the poorvaangam, call 

Mahaganapathi into fire and do shodasopachaara pooj=
a. Then do the mantras 

you want. Do a shodasopachaara pooja again at the =
end. Do uttaraangam with 

avijnaataadi praayaschitta mantras etc just as i=
n the short procedure. But 

one can optionally do Jayaadi homam also in th=
e uttaraangam. It is a bunch 

of aahutis for various celestial beings with=
 veda mantras. The rest is 

similar to the short procedure.



I have done=
 big ones as well, including 7-hour Mahaganapathi homam and 

9-hour Chandi=
 homam. But I have no doubt that a short homam repeated 

everyday is more =
effective than a long homam done once in a while.



*        *        *


=

I once saw some priests performing a Mahaganapathi homam and Navagraha 

h=
omam. The priest declared, "all the bad karmas of whoever is present here 
=

are burned today and all of you will start on a clean slate now." Though 
=

they did a detailed ritual, the actual mantras of Ganesha and planets were=
 

done to the minimum. For example, they offered the mantra of each planet=
 

just 4 times! For such a small count of mantras to actually burn all the=
 

karmas of 100 people, the performer has to be a rishi or something! I wa=
s 

amused by the declaration.



Obviously, they were under time pressure =
and made a wrong tradeoff.



The point I wanted to make is this. If you ar=
e able to do the main thing in 

a ritual for 2 hours, then it is reasonabl=
e to have 30 minutes of overhead. 

If you have only 40 minutes, it is a ba=
d idea to spend 30 minutes on the 

overhead and wrap up the main thing in =
10 minutes. It is better to do the 

overhead in 10 min and do the main par=
t for 30 min. It is better that way.



Sometimes, I see learned priests ma=
king the wrong tradeoffs when pressed for 

time. In this age, most people =
are pressed for time. They need help to make 

the correct tradeoffs so tha=
t they maximize the impact of the little they 

get to do.
