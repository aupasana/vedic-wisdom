Namaste Lalit,

I am cc'ing this mail to vedic-wisdom yahoogroup as s=
ome points here should be of interest to people there.
=C2=A0
> Have you ev=
er go thrpough any of Vedas completely, Never !!
=C2=A0
Of course not. In f=
act, nobody can go through Veda completely in one lifetime. When Maharshi B=
haradwaja was trying to *read* and understand more and more Vedic knowledge=
, he was told by Indra that reading more will not help and he just needed t=
o meditate more time with Gayatri mantra, in order to understand Veda.
=C2=
=A0
One cannot understand Veda intellectually by reading or thinking. Veda =
is beyond rational or emotional intelligence.

=C2=A0=


If anybody wants to understand Veda really, I suggest picking one verse (=
perhaps associated with a rishi that one feels an attachment to) and medita=
ting with it all the time. If one's mind is always filled with that verse, =
a day might come when the meaning of the verse *reveals* itself to one. Ved=
a can be "understood" only through "revelation".
=C2=A0
Even if one properl=
y understands a *single* verse of Veda in one's life, it is enough and one'=
s life is fruitful!

Restraint is shakti. One k=
nowing when and how to use one's shakti is given higher shaktis by Nature. =
One not knowing when and how to use one's shakti ends up wasting what one h=
as and not getting more.
=C2=A0
When past rinas and conditioning make one p=
rone to anger or hatred for someone, one tends to go with the flow of that =
conditioning without realizing that one is wasting one's shakti. A wise one=
 uses free will to resist that tendency.

Narsimha,

It's a bigotry, real ignorance and mounted ego e=
ven on matter related to Vedas also, Have you ever go thrpough any of Vedas=
 completely, Never !!

You don't have capability to admit your mistakes and=
 shortcomings leave alone study of Vedas but a plan to preach the world, se=
lf made Jagat Guru.


Aurbindo has not written extensively on Vedas, except=
 for some primitive writings on few chapters of Vedas and that without ment=
ioning sanskrit Dhatus and derivation of terms used in hymns, he has not gi=
ven no Anvaya.


You have all the liberty to post your uneducated views bef=
ooling innocent audience just to flaunt your's Gurudom, but with this attit=
ude you will meet failure there also same way you failed in making right pr=
edictions.


I have understood Manish as well through his initial activitie=
s in JG.

Milk, ghee, cows, horses etc referred in=

Narsimha,

=C2=A0
Neither you nor Manish could establi=
sh anything on=C2=A0Manish's connection with Guru Gorakhnath despite all su=
ch claims, You have good technical skills and have made a software for astr=
ologers but when you write content on sprituality or religion, you should g=
ain some qualification and spiritual upliftment, but like others, you seem =
to be in hurry.


=C2=A0
I criticizie immature as well as incorrect=C2=A0co=
mments passed by you=C2=A0on=C2=A0mentioning of Soma as Plant in Vedas=C2=
=A0on your post, you said - "The views held by some on Soma plant referred =
in Veda are questionable".


=C2=A0
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishGr=
oup/message/30976=C2=A0
=C2=A0
You should have botherd reading Vedas before=
 passing such a remark, but you didn't, so, in order to spread streak of tr=
uth, I am quoting=C2=A0a verse from the rikveda hoping you w'd complete stu=
dy of our dharma shastras and then w'd step in commenting anything- 



!! =
Tubhyam Hinvaanovasishhtta Gaa apo Adhukschhansiimavibhirdribhirnarah
Piben=
dra SvaahaaPrahutam VashatkritamHotraada Somam Prathamo ya Eishishhe !!

=
=C2=A0
The Rikvedic verse=C2=A0describes=C2=A0the process how Yajanik prepa=
res Soma=C2=A0(essence) by grinding it=C2=A0through stone grinder, adds=C2=
=A0milk and water, then purifies it through woolen filter and t dedicates=
=C2=A0=C2=A0it to Indra to have it, thus it's clear that Soma as a plant or=
 herb=C2=A0was discovered by Vedic Sages, Herb Soma 's color and place of o=
rigin is also described in Rikveda.



Over the period of time we have lost=
 it's knowledge, it's a case almost like Mrita sanjivini Bati, however, Mri=
ta Sanjivini is indentifiable and still available=C2=A0but Soma is not.



=
It's true that sages use metaphores in several mantras but that's not alway=
s, right now, you should be a student, and if you have some=C2=A0opinion or=
 personal views on any matter, express that like a student, so that, reader=
s should not get influenced rather they turn to self study of vedas, upnish=
ads=C2=A0and shastras, I hope, you are aware that a section of netfriendly=
=C2=A0youngsters consider you trustworthy becuse of your JHORA but if you d=
on't bother integrity and accountability by self assumed a high status for =
yourself while=C2=A0responding or reverting or retorting to others, that's =
not a help but a harm.



In above post, you also said - "Sacrificing the I=
-ness, I-am-ness, I-do-ness and the overall individualized consciousness in=
 the fire of fine discrimination is the true internal yajna that is the foc=
us of Veda and not external rituals where ghee, grains etc are offered in a=
n external fire, though we use the external fire to increase internal fire =
through resonance". 



Sadhaka sees Ghee's Auhiti is also manifestation of=
 Brahma, External or internal everything is Brahma, Awake !

As long as you=
 are trapped in thoughts of duality - "Spiritual Vs Material", you are far =
away from understanding both and continue imagining and supporting or rejec=
ting Vedic Wisdom=C2=A0in this=C2=A0way or other, it's all wrong.



If you=
 ever read Upnishads, you w'd come learn their message,=C2=A0Chhandogya Upn=

I had admonished you in the past as well, Vedas and Upinshads =
