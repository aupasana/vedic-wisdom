Namaste Davyd,
 
Rebirth is not necessarily instantaneous. A variable amoun=
t of time may pass before rebirth.
 
Some people are so attached to the old=
 body and old desires. Someone whose self-consciousness simply cannot accep=
t that the body is gone and is still attached to body and its mind may rema=
in as a pitri that needs to be freed from the blocking desires to be reborn=
. They may be stuck for a long time before being reborn.
 
Some people are =
attached to the desires, but they realize that they need a new body and acc=
ept the loss of old body.  They will be reborn to pursue to desires. Howeve=
r, one needs to find the right place and right people (father, mother etc) =
with appropriate kaarmik debts, before being reborn. That may take a short =
time in some cases and a long time in some cases.
 
Some people with good k=
armas are not attached to the old body or its desires, but they are reborn =
to fulfill the Will of Nature and enact god's lila. Such beings can afford =
to wait for the right time to be born again in a new body. They may wait fo=
r tens or hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of years before being =
reborn.
 
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, a great saint and guru of Swami Vivekana=
nda, said that he would be reborn on earth after about 100 years along with=
 everybody else who came with him. Of course, one should not think that he =
was in pitri loka as a pitri. Pitri loka is for beings with a strong self-i=
dentification with the sensory mind. Ramakrishna and his team probably asce=
nded to one of the higher realm of consciousness after leaving those bodies=
 and would be born again when the right opportunity presents itself.
 
The =
exact gap before rebirth, in what realm of consciousness one's self-conscio=
usness resides during the gap and what one's consciousness does during that=
 gap, is a function of one's own conditioning and karmas.
 
Best regards,
N=
arasimha

My beloved mother passed away several months ago and I feel that I should d=

ong of me? Is there anything in Hinduism which speaks to that?
