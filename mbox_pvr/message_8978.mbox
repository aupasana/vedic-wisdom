Namaste Sir,
=A0
This is kind of like asking "how can I expect a letter se=
nt to my head office in New Delhi to fix problems at my local branch in Hyd=
erabad"? If someone in the head office in New Delhi wants, they can fix the=
 problems in any branch.
=A0
Devas identify more with soul than with body. =
However, IF a deva wants, he/she can fix problems in our minds and bodies t=
oo.
=A0Best regards,

Narasimha
