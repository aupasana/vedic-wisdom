Namaste friends,
 
Happy Vijaya Dasami!
 
(1) I do not share Dr Choudhary's=
 opinion about reading English translation instead of Sanskrit verses if on=
e is not initiated.
 
(2) Initiation serves two purposes:
 
(2a) As in the =
analogy I gave earlier, a rich father may open a bank account in a son's na=
me with a starting balance of one million dollars. Similarly, a guru with s=
ome achievement in a mantra can transfer some of it to a disciple. However,=
 one without a rich father is still better off opening a bank account with =
a zero balance and building it up slowly with one's own hard work. Similarl=
y, one not finding a guru can still do sadhana with famous mantras and buil=
d one's own spiritual account. If you find a guru to initiate you (not as a=
 formality, but truly initiate you), get initiated. Otherwise, just go ahea=
d and do it.
 
(2b) Mantras and rituals are used for two purposes - (i) for=
 getting specific material results and (ii) as tools of increasing surrende=
r and making spiritual progress. In the case of (ii), initiation is not tha=
t important. But, in the case of (i), there are pitfalls and a guru can pre=
pare one sufficiently. One can get in trouble otherwise.
 
However, as I sa=
id several times, there are very few people who can do (i) now-a-days. Natu=
re has destabilized the whole system, for a reason, as Kali progressed. I s=
uggest doing mantras and rituals only for increasing surrender, getting wha=
tever material results god wants to give and making spiritual progress. If =
one is meant to do rituals for begetting *specific* material results (for o=
neself or others or society/universe in general), Nature will make arrangem=
ents for one to get correct knowledge of such rituals. But, as one starts, =
one should start with the attitude of (ii).
 
(3) If you want to do Chandip=
ath or any mantra or any ritual or any homam, do it  with the attitude of "=
I have several material desires, but I do not know how to fulfil them. Beca=
use of this ritual, god may give any material results or spiritual results =
and not necessarily fulfil my desires. I will accept whatever god gives. I =
want to increase my devotion and surrender and make spiritual progress". Yo=
u are then SAFE. Initiation is not required. That attitude itself is an ini=
tiation!
 
(4) Gentle deities give good results slowly, but there are fewer=
 hiccups. Fierce deities give results fast, but there may be some hiccups. =
I gave this analogy earlier also. Imagine that a person is taking rotten fr=
uits from a fruit basket and throwing them in garbage and trying to retriev=
e one good fruit from under them. If the person is gentle, one may do it ge=
ntly and the spillage of rotten fruits on the floor will be minimal. If the=
 person is aggressive, one may do it fast and there may be more spillage of=
 rotten fruits on the floor. But the good fruit stuck under the rotten frui=
ts will be retrieved faster. Similarly, phala of your karmas is in a basket=
. The deity is trying to take bad fruits and throw them in garbage and give=
 you a good fruit to eat. There may be some spillage. A gentle deity like G=
anapathi, Vishnu or Lakshmi may take more time to get out the good fruit, b=
ut the spillage will be minimal. A fierce deity like Chandi or Bhairava or =
Kali or Narasimha may have more spillage, but the good fruit comes out fast=
er.
 
At the end, remember that these fruits are not deity's creations, but=
 fruits of your own actions. Without sadhana, you would've had to eat each =
of those rotten fruits before eating the good fruits!
 
Nevertheless, one u=
nable to take some of the spillage of rotten fruits is better off avoiding =
fierce deities such as Chandi and staying with gentler deities. If initiati=
on if made mandatory, one can be assessed by a guru before starting a pract=
ice. If you realize the above, you can start mantras without initiation. If=
 some bad results occut, you have to realize that it is a fruit of your own=
 actions and the deity is trying to accelerate good results. If you are wea=
k-hearted, stick to gentler deities.
 
(5) Some people who never lit a lamp=
 in their life and were ignorant of rituals, are doing daily homam now. Som=
e people who took several hours to read Saptashati for the first time just =
2-3 years back are now doing Chandi homam with entire saptashati everyday. =
I know that some of them have transformed a lot and have experienced some t=
hings too. Obviously, they have done sadhana with fire and sadhana of the F=
ierce aspects of Divine Mother in some past lives.
 
(6) In this age of ign=
orance and rank materialism, if someone has even a faint idea that spiritua=
l progress is important, is looking for god and is attracted to a specific =
advanced sadhana (e.g. Chandipath), that person obviously has some good kar=
mas and good vasanas. That person has done that sadhana in the past. Previo=
us life's sadhana itself is one's adhikara.
 
(7) If you have a good unders=
tanding of what is what, how things work, why one should do something, how =
to do it, what is more important and what is less important, that is what i=
nitiation is all about!
 
Best regards
Narasimha

You are probably very right in your assumption when you say Adhikara to rec=
