Namaste,

I am glad to read that. THAT is the real thing that matters. Neither 
knowledge nor mystical experiences matter. Overcoming of ego and moderation 
of qualities such as attraction/repulsion to things, fear and anger are the 
things that matter. Spiritual sadhana is a process of self-modification. It 
is a long process.

> I know i'm still at the rockbottom of the path and have my way to uphill

If you keep that spirit up, you will go far.

Best regards,
Narasimha

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] On Kundalini (Re: Re: Urdhwa-Retas)


Dear Utpalji,

I completely "ECHO" with you, the words from sri PVRji are ever 
enlightening.

In the past, I have read lot of books, some with doubt that is what these 
guys explaining is really "REAL"? or????.....well that was when i ws in my 
initial stages about a decade back ..still in teens..

And then slowly started reading more and more and got convinced that 
"probably" this is all for "REAL" and people are really experiencing the 
bliss within..

Now got to a stage that no amount of reading is helpful unless you really 
sit and "EXPERIENCE" this bliss "WITHIN YOU"..and right at that juncture i 
came accross PVRji's astrology lectures and started listening to 
them..infact more than astrology i was lured to his spiritual bent of mind 
and thinking and his lucid explanation of various things..that's when i 
decided to drop everything else..and just follow his advice and got 
seriously embarked on the spiritual path..i have been doing homama over the 
weekends regularly..and sincea about 1 month i'm doing it everyday...true to 
to his words.. i can see lot of change in myself..the way i feel and react 
etc..

I know i'm still at the rockbottom of the path and have my way to uphill as 
compared to many learned and spirituallly advanced souls even in this 
list..i just want to follow the advice of PVRji and perhaps be able to to 
loose "myself" in the "god".

Thanks
Krishna Kanth
