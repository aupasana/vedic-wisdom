Namaste,
 
There was some discussion on breathing exercises such as Sudarsh=
an kriya taught at AOL courses. I do not want to comment on specific course=
s or techniques, but will make a comment on Raja yoga practices in general.=

 
Breathing is a very important activity and is connected to the balance b=
etween sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. It maintains the li=
fe force and emotional balance. Several breathing exercises are taught by v=
arious scriptures and traditions, such as praanaayaama taught by Baba Ramde=
v of Patanjali Yoga Foundation, Kriya yoga taught by Mahavatar Babaji and P=
aramahamsa Yogananda, Sudarsana kriya taught by Art Of Living foundation.
 =

All these fall under Raja yoga, in the four-fold division of Jnaana, Bhakt=
i, Karma and Raja yogas. If these exercises are used as a means to regulate=
 breathing and thoughts upto some level and keep the body fit, it is fine. =
They are quite useful.
 
*        *        *
 
I was watching a nice TV pro=
gram of a Baba who popularized praanaayaamas like kapaalabhaati and anuloma=
-viloma among Indian masses. He talked about breathing in and out slowly an=
d gradually reaching nirbeeja samadhi through it. I was amused. Most people=
 have too many (and quite firm) impurities in their subtle bodies in the fo=
rm of prior mental conditioning to be cleared just through breathing exerci=
ses and to reach samadhi - nirbeeja or sabeeja - just by doing praanaayaama=
. However, I like the praanaayaamas he teaches. In fact, things like anulom=
a-viloma praanaayaama and kapaalabhaati are badly needed in today's stresse=
d out world. However, I see this as something that relieves physical and em=
otional stress and enables better spiritual sadhana, rather than something =
that enables spiritual realization.
 
Of course, there are yogic techniques=
 meant for raising Kundalini forcefully (e.g. bandhas such as Jalandhara ba=
ndha). But, with such techniques, one is playing with fire. Ramakrishna Par=
amahamsa discouraged his disciples (e.g. Swami Abhedananda and Swami Yogana=
nda) from Hatha yoga and other Raja yoga practices, telling them to stay aw=
ay from practices that emphasize the body and to absorb the mind in god'a n=
ame instead. He said that realizng god through practices that emphasize the=
 body and its perfection, is nearly impossible in this age due to impuritie=
s present everywhere, in food, water, air and thinking.
 
If one practices =
yama, niyama etc and attains perfect composure, then it may be possible to =
go into samadhi through the control of breathing. But it is unrealistic for=
 most people. Suppose one has an ocean (samsaara) to cross and a boat (body=
) is given to one. If one is close to the bank (liberation), one can just j=
ump out of the boat and land on the bank. If one in the middle of an ocean =
jumps out of the boat, one will only sink in the ocean! In jnaana yoga, bha=
kti yoga or karma yoga, one uses knowledge or faith or ability to work with=
out expectations as a rudder to steer the boat towards the bank. In raaja y=
oga, one takes control like a raja (king) and just jumps out of the boat. T=
hat will work if one is close to the bank, i.e. already quite elevated. Oth=
erwise, just jumping out of the boat is very risky. Raja yoga requires a lo=
t of preparation. One in Raja yoga practices needs a good guru to gauge one=
's progress and prescribe the next steps at every stage. If some things are=
 done too early, it may result in irreversible damage.
 
Bottomline: Use va=
rious praanaayaamas, kriyas and other exercises for physical and emotional =
health and to create an environment conducive to spiritual sadhana. But do =
not be under an impression that you can realize god through such activities=
 alone. That may have been possible in the past, but it nearly impossible f=
or most people today.
 
*        *        *
 
Regarding charging a lot of m=
oney for such things, one should realize that Ramakrishna and Ramana mahars=
hi stayed away from money for a reason. When Srila Prabhupada initiated so =
many people into mahamantra, he did not charge any fee. He had faith in Kri=
shna and ended up building a really big organization, though he did not dem=
and any fee for his lectures or initiations and did not keep his teachings =
secretive.
 
If Ramakrishna Mutt is doing great service even today, it is b=
ecause the organization was built by Swami Vivekananda, Swami Brahmananda, =
Swami Shivananda and Swami Premananda with a lot of sattwa guna and they ke=
pt rajas and tamas at bay. They suffered in the beginning and it took a lon=
g time to build, but it will last a long time. Things built with tamas or r=
ajas do not last too long and do not take people to god. One intending to b=
uild an organization to fulfil one's dharma should try to ensure that sattw=
a drives the activities and not rajas or tamas. Usually, money brings rajas=
 or even tamas into picture and that is why great masters have been wary.
 =

There may be exceptions of course. All activities of a fully realized and =
liberated soul without any self-identification are guided by sattwa. If suc=
h a person builds an organization based on selling divine knowledge, it mea=
ns that Nature wanted him/her to sell divine knowledge for some reason. Suc=
h things are possible but rare. In general, you see great souls like Ramakr=
ishna, Ramana Maharshi and Srila Prabhupada operating within their means an=
d not charging for spiritual knowledge.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
