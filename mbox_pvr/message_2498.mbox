Dear Rajarshi,
 
You have a knack for asking important questions, that soun=
d simple but touch upon deep issues.
 
> I mean if I am focusing on Mahagan=
apati, am I just bringing out the
> energy of Mahaganapati from inside me o=
r is there one single, universal,
> omnipotent divinty called Mahaganapati =
who exists in the universe, and
> I am trying to invite him into the fire?
=
 
Terms like internal god and external god are just a manner of speaking, f=
or easy understanding and simplification of concepts. In reality, a deity e=
xisting microcosmically "inside" you, a deity existing microcosmically insi=
de me, a deity existing microcosmically inside someone else and a deity exi=
sting "externally" in the macrocosm (universe) is one and the same and ther=
e is absolutely no difference between all of them! That is essentially the =
Upanishadic understanding.
 
In fact, when you say "inside me", ask yoursel=
f : "what is this I"? Is it the physical body? Is it the subtle body? Is it=
 the causal body? When mind entertains the notion that it is a physical bod=
y, it indeed becomes aware of a physical body and looks at it as I. When mi=
nd entertains the notion that it is a subtle body, it indeed becomes aware =
of a subtle body and looks it as I. When mind entertains the notion that it=
 is a causal body, it indeed becomes aware of a causal body and looks it as=
 I. When mind finally overcomes all such notions one after the other, it ma=
y look at the supra-cosmic body (supreme cosmic being) as I. According to u=
panishadic understanding, there is nothing other than Brahman or supreme co=
smic being. Thus, expressions like "inside me", "inside you" and "inside hi=
m" are just expressions that describe false notions rather than reality. Th=
ere is no real you, I and he, but there is only a supreme cosmic being.
 
*=
        *        *
 
When you have a conditioned mind, which has a notion t=
hat there is a certain entity called "Rajarshi Nandy", an entity called "Na=
rasimha Rao" etc, these entities exist within your mind, for as long as you=
r mind can keep those notions alive. When all such false notions are succes=
sfully eliminated, only supreme cosmic being is left for the mind to focus =
on.
 
When a conditioned mind that has a notion that it is a specific perso=
n called "Rajarshi Nandy" in a specific body, such a mind is pre-occupied w=
ith so many things that it cannot focus itself on god perfectly. Due to its=
 pre-occupations, it can only focus itself on small aspects of god, in a ve=
ry limited way. This is like a mirror capturing Sun in a limited way. Sun's=
 image may be reflected on 100 mirrors in 100 ways. One mirror may be broke=
n and dark colored. It may reflect very little sunlight and sun may appear =
broken. Like that, each mind can focus on god in a different way, to a diff=
erent extent. We express this fact in alternate words by saying "the mind f=
ocuses on internal god and he is limited".
 
This is just a simple way to p=
ut things. In reality, the issue is not internal vs external. The issue is =
the mind's ability to perceive and focus on god. As the mind's pre-occupati=
on with other things comes down and its ability to focus on god goes up, we=
 say that the internal god is becoming stronger. Again, this is just a way =
of representation. In reality, god, whether you call him internal or extern=
al, is infinite and does not become weaker or stronger. But mind can focus =
better and mind's idea of god becomes stronger. After all, a dirty mirror r=
eflecting Sun may show a dirty and dull Sun at first and show a cleaner and=
 brighter Sun after you clean the mirror. Sun has not really become cleaner=
 or bighter. He is the same always. We can say "Sun in the mirror" has beco=
me cleaner and brighter. But there is really no Sun "in the" mirror! Though=
 we may talk about Sun in mirror 1, Sun in mirror 2, Sun in mirror 3 and th=
e external Sun, they are all one and the same!
 
This manner of speaking ab=
out internal vs external god and talking about strengthening internal god i=
s used to simplify things. Bottomline is that any visualization of god by a=
 mind is limited by the conditioning, abilities and impurities of that mind=
. By allowing the mind to visualize god, to the best of its ability, on a r=
egular basis, we sharpen its ability to visualize god. Eventually, mind los=
es all other pre-occupations and becomes fully absorbed in the infinite god=
. Then we say that internal god has become infinite. This is just a manner =
of speaking.
 
*        *        *
 
I want to give a small practical examp=
le, that is somewhat relevant and illustrates some concepts.
 
Once a coupl=
e of priests with a high spiritual caliber were conducting a Rudraabhisheka=
m. They were chanting Sree Rudram 11 times. A person who worships Mahaalaks=
hmi was sitting in a corner of the room. He started to meditate with Savitr=
u Gayatri mantra, his favorite mantra. Whichever mantra or deity he worship=
s, he always considers everything to be an offering to Mahalakshmi and imag=
ines only her as receiving the mantra. Here also, he was visualizing Mahala=
kshmi as filling his entire being and was offering Gayatri mantra to her. A=
fter a while, his Kundalini rose and his self-awareness was modified. He lo=
st the regular awareness of body, perceived an all-pervading light that he =
was part of and remained in a nice spiritual state for a while. When he cam=
e back and the pooja was finished, one of the priests described something u=
nusual that he "saw". In the middle of the pooja, that priest turned toward=
s this person and was surprised by what he saw. He saw a tall 18-handed for=
m of Mahalakshmi standing in the place of this person for a little while.
 =

As that person meditated, his senses turned inward and he was looking inte=
rnally. His mind was focused on Mahaalakshmi, who filled his entire being i=
n his visualization. As Kundalini rose, his distinction of internal and ext=
ernal blurred and he perceived himself as *a part* of all-pervading light (=
it is neither "internal" nor "external"). He basically perceived Mahaalaksh=
mi as the all-pervading light that he was also a part of. However, the prie=
st who happened to look at him at that time was also in a purified state an=
d so he noticed something. His mental conditioning at that time made him se=
e a specific external form rather than an all-pervading form. But both the =
priest and the person perceived the same entity in two different ways. One =
was external and limited. The other was neither internal nor external (but =
obtained by looking internally at first) and unlimited. But, both are the s=
ame. They appeared different to two minds because of the conditioning of th=
ose minds rather than anything else, just as the same Sun may appear differ=
ent in two different mirrors!
 
*        *        *
 
No amount of theoriza=
tion will help one fully understand and appreciate things like this. The mo=
st important thing is to do some sadhana, such as homam or meditation, on a=
 regular basis. No effort is wasted and eventually gives results when there=
 is critical mass. Whatever I say, whatever masters have said before and wh=
atever rishis taught in upanishads, can be understood and appreciated throu=
gh direct experience. THAT is the goal of sadhana. Reading scriptures and m=
ails like this is only a starting point. One has to engage in some sadhana.=
 Even people like Ramana Maharshi, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Trilinga Swami,=
 Vivekananda etc did sadhana for many years, before they realized god.

Narasimha

  ----- Original Message ----- 
        Namaste Narasimha,

   =
     I little bit of deviation from this topic of this mail.

        There=
 is something which I find a little confusion. I hope you will clear that p=
oint. You mentioned:

        The god in your homam fire is not an external=
 god, but your own internal god. Through your mental focus, you are project=
ing the limited manifestation of god inside you into fire and honing your a=
bility to focus the mind on that god. I want to clarify one thing here. Tho=
ugh there is actually infinite divinity inside you, your pre-occupation wit=
h so many other things limits (or zeroes) the divinity that your mind can f=
ocus on, access and perceive. By focusing on it more and more, you grow it.=
 Fire is a good medium to project it for focusing better.

        When we =
are doing a homam or any puja, we are trying to create the deity from withi=
n ourselves where it exists. My questions is, is this where all deities res=
ide(inside)? I mean if I am focusing on Mahaganapati, am I just bringing ou=
t the energy of Mahaganapati from inside me or is there one single, univers=
al, omnipotent divinty called Mahaganapati who exists in the universe, and =
I am trying to invite him into the fire?

        I remember a line from Vi=
malananda where he says, initially we create the deity in the astral body s=
o that this deity (the one we projected) may lead us to the real deity who =
exists outside in the universe.

        Did I understand the procedure cor=
rect? Kindly put down your thoughts on this.

        -Regards
         Raj=
arshi

        --- On Thu, 10/9/09, Narasimha PVR Rao <pvr@...> wro=
te:
          Namaste Krishna Kanth,

          Suppose god really came to =
your place in a human form and asked you to give him some nice food. Will y=
ou allow someone who cooks terribly to cook? Why not allow him to "serve go=
d"?

          It is not just about "serving god", but serving god *well*. =
A purified servant of god serves god with single-minded focus and devotion =
and has no other thoughts in mind when serving god. A more normal person ma=
y think various things in mind even when serving god. There is some self-ce=
nteredness and ego even in serving god.

          The god in your homam fi=
re is not an external god, but your own internal god. Through your mental f=
ocus, you are projecting the limited manifestation of god inside you into f=
ire and honing your ability to focus the mind on that god. I want to clarif=
y one thing here. Though there is actually infinite divinity inside you, yo=
ur pre-occupation with so many other things limits (or zeroes) the divinity=
 that your mind can focus on, access and perceive. By focusing on it more a=
nd more, you grow it. Fire is a good medium to project it for focusing bett=
er. On practice, the divinity inside you that you can focus on and perceive=
 grows with time. Thus, remember that what is in fire is the limited manife=
station of god inside you that you are able to focus, acces and perceive. T=
his limited divinity should be nurtured slowly and allowed to grow, rather =
than used up for unnecessary things. When this divinity grows and becomes i=
nfinite, all your desires and other thoughts will vanish and you will be ab=
le to single-mindedly focus on that divinity. Some precautions will help yo=
u in the journey.

          Karmas and thoughts of people who are making o=
fferings in your homam fire are basically being received in your internal g=
od. If he has enough power (his power is, after all, the power of *your own=
* focus!) to grant a specific desire of someone, he may just do it. But tha=
t makes him weaker and who knows whether the desire was worthwhile?!

     =
     Of course, when you are offering things in fire, you yourself may have=
 some unnecessary desires which may slow down the spiritual progress. But, =
that is a necessary evil and there is no escape. But, why let someone else'=
s desires cause an extra slow down?

          Thus, this is not a matter o=
f political correctness and being nice.

          However, there is alread=
y a lot of karmic intermixing between people very closely connected to one =
karmically, like wife, children and parents. Wife's desires may affect husb=
and's desires and mother's desires may affect son's desires already (atleas=
t in a closely bonded and old-fashioned families). So there is no significa=
nt drawback to allowing them to share fire.

          Bottomline:

       =
   If some people are so close to you that you want to allow their karmas a=
nd their desires to affect your spiritual progress and slow you down, then =
allow such people to offer in your homam fire. Even if you do not allow spe=
cifically, some close people's karmas and desires may already be directly a=
ffecting your own karmas and desires and hence slowing you down!

         =
 Usually, that would be immediate family, but you know your situation bette=
r.

          Best regards,
          Narasimha

mantra. Whichever mantra or deity he worships, he always considers every=
thing to 
be an offering to Mahalakshmi and imagines only her as receiving =
the mantra. 
Here also, he was visualizing Mahalakshmi as filling his entir=

offering Gayatri mantra to her. After a while, his Kundali=

self-awareness was modified. He lost the regular awareness=

all-pervading light that he was part of and remaine=

for a while. When he came back and the pooja w=

described something unusual that he "saw".=
 In the middle of the pooja, that

 Through your mental focus, you are projecting

          here. Th=
ough there is actually infinite divinity inside you, your

   =
       for focusing better. On practice, the divinity inside you that you c=
an 
          focus on and perceive grows with time. Thus, remember that wh=
at is in 
          fire is the limited manifestation of god inside you tha=
t you are able 
          to focus, acces and perceive. This limited divini=
ty should be nurtured 
          slowly and allowed to grow, rather than us=
ed up for unnecessary 
          things. When this divinity grows and becom=
es infinite, all your 
          desires and other thoughts will vanish and=
 you will be able to 
          single-mindedly focus on that divinity. Som=
e precautions will help you 
          in the journey.<BR><BR>Karmas and th=
oughts of people who are making 
          offerings in your homam fire are=
 basically being received in your 
          internal god. If he has enough=
 power (his power is, after all, the 
          power of *your own* focus!)=
 to grant a specific desire of someone, he 
          may just do it. But t=
hat makes him weaker and who knows whether the 
          desire was worthw=
hile?!<BR><BR>Of course, when you are offering things 
          in fire, y=
ou yourself may have some unnecessary desires which may slow 
          dow=
n the spiritual progress. But, that is a necessary evil and there 
        =
  is no escape. But, why let someone else's desires cause an extra slow 
  =
        down?<BR><BR>Thus, this is not a matter of political correctness an=
d 
          being nice.<BR><BR>However, there is already a lot of karmic 
=
          intermixing between people very closely connected to one karmical=
ly, 
          like wife, children and parents. Wife's desires may affect h=
usband's 
          desires and mother's desires may affect son's desires a=
lready (atleast 
          in a closely bonded and old-fashioned families).=
 So there is no 
          significant drawback to allowing them to share 
=
          fire.<BR><BR>Bottomline:<BR><BR>If some people are so close to yo=
u 
          that you want to allow their karmas and their desires to affec=
t your 
          spiritual progress and slow you down, then allow such peo=

          in your homam fire. Even if you do not allow specif=
