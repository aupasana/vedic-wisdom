Namaste,
 
I suppose you are referring to my mail sent to sjcBoston list canceling today evening's Jyotish class due to the Hanuman abhishekam at the local temple.
 
Lord Hanuman was born in Poorvabhadra nakshatra "(puurvaabhaadraa prasuutaaya maMgaLam shrii hanuumate"). So poorvabhadra nakshatra is good for praying to him or doing his rituals. My wife and other friends organize a Hanuman abhishekam at the local temple on every Poorvabhadra nakshatra day.
 
Thanks,
Narasimha
