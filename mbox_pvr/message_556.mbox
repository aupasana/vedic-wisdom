Namaste,

(1) When we performed Shata Chandi homam which triggered the homam movement, 
we did 108 patha (reading) and 10 homas. The is what they do traditionally.

However, according to my guru also, a true shata chandi homam involves doing 
108 Chandi homas (108 priests doing once each or 12 priests doing 9 times 
each or 6 priests doing 18 times each etc).

Whatever name we use for it, chanting 108 times and doing 9 or 10 or 11 
homas is also a very good thing. But doing in the fire is more powerful than 
chanting.

(2) Pronunciation is important. But love, devotion, humility and surrender 
to the deity are as important if not more important.

Swami Sathasivom (http://www.swamisathasivom.org/), the head priest of 
Kalikambal temple in Chennai, is a rare priest I have seen. His surrender to 
Kaali, his disinterest in material things, his ability to see the Real 
without being deluded by what is on the surface, the sincerity with which he 
does his poojas and homas, the way he works hard for others at the cost of 
his own health (without any expectations and with just love for all), his 
lack of ego and the childlike simplicity and innocence he has are 
unimaginable in today's age. He is a combination of a priest, a bhakta and a 
yogi, a class of people who were once common but fast disappearing in this 
age!

Best regards,
Narasimha
