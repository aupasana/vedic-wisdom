Namaste,
 
As your question may be of interest to others also, I am cc'ing =
this to vedic-wisdom yahoogroup dedicated to spirituality, after deleting r=
eferences to your name.
 
First of all, dharma varies from person to person=
. Not every person can renounce. Not every person can perform rituals. Not =
every person can read scriptures. Not every person can contemplate the teac=
hings of scriptures. Not every person can visit temples.
 
Different people=
 have different duties given by Nature as a result of previous samskaras of=
 the person. One needs to find out and fulfil the duties with as little att=
achment and ego as possible.
 
Pre-existing karmik debts of some may make i=
t their dharma to make a lot of money and use it for some good causes. That=
 may require bribing or lying.
 
That itself is not a great sin. We all do =
many sins.
 
One of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa's sishyas, Surendra Nath Mitra,=
 worked at a British merchant firm and was a rich man in Calcutta. He was o=
ne of the providers of Ramakrishna and the land where Belur Math was starte=
d was bought with the money he had donated. When he was confused, Ramakrish=
na told him:
 
"The renunciation of 'lust and gold' is for sannyasins. It i=
s not for you. Now and then you should go into solitude and call on God wit=
h a yearning heart. Your renunciation should be mental.
"For you, like Chai=
tanya said, the disciplines to be practised are kindness to living beings, =
service to the devotees, and chanting the name of God.
"Why do I say all th=
is to you? You work in a merchant's office. I say this to you because you h=
ave many duties to perform there.
"You tell lies at the office. Then why do=
 I eat the food you offer me? Because you give money in charity; you give a=
way more than you earn. 'The seed of the melon is bigger than the fruit,' a=
s the saying goes.
"I cannot eat anything offered by miserly people. Their =
wealth is squandered in these ways: first, litigation; second, thieves and =
robbers; third, physicians; fourth, their wicked children's extravagance. I=
t is like that."
 
Ramakrishna told Surendra to remember the Mother in all =
his activities and offer all his activities to Her mentally. He also told h=
im to always give in charity.
 
*        *        *
 
Similarly, if your jo=
b requires you to lie or give bribes, don't worry about it. If that job is =
needed for fulfilling your dharma towards self or family or world, do what =
is needed. However, minimize selfishness. Do things for others. Do it for y=
our family and for the society in general. Instead of using all the money f=
or yourself or your family, be generous and donate some to the needy. Also =
donate some to devotees and saintly people and serve them. The lying and br=
ibes and earning good money (which your samskaras are pulling you to do) wi=
ll be worthwhile then.
 
> Some say to grow one has to do that. Some say to=
 survive one
> has to give. So I am wondering what the correct way should b=
e.
 
If you do it to survive, survive and do good deeds. If you do it to gr=
ow, grow and make sure that some unselfiish dharma around you also grows al=
ong with you.
 
Nothing is good or bad per se.  How you do it and what fram=
e of mind you do it with is more important than what you do.
 
At the end o=
f the day, there is some good and bad and they balance out. The trick is to=
 find the right balance.
 
*        *        *
 
As you engage in various a=
ctivities related to the job, mentally offer them to the Divine Mother. Thi=
s will eventually fill the mind with devotive energy even in the middle of =
mundane activities. If you are ashamed to do something, you better not do i=
t. If there is justification for something and you are clear in your mind w=
hy you are doing it, then you should not be ashamed of it and you should be=
 able to offer it to the Mother. So offer all your activities to the Mother=
 mentally as you do them. If you get into this practice, it will make your =
mind more confident and calm and increase devotion.
 
*        *        *
 =

People depending on your for their food etc will also get a part of your k=
arma. So your wife and children will get some part of that karma.
 
However=
, if you engage in the activities with love, devotion and a calm mind and p=
ut a part of the money to good unselfish use, you need not worry about it.
=
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

  ----- Original Message ----- 
  Dear Narsimhaji
   
  Tha=
nk you for taking the time off your busy schedule.
  My queiry is as under
=
   
  It is my desire to grow spiritually as well as materialistically. In =
fact I feel that in the rat race of today, to live in a city one must have =
decent amount of money where one can survive and afford the necessities lik=
e car, villa, so on and so forth. I do believe that one must not hanker aft=
er money (specially if one is also bent to grow spiritually) but at the sam=
e time one must have enough money so that at least ones one or two generati=
on does not have to worry about the same.
  Considering the above fact, I f=
eel either you must be a specialist or be in a very special field or if you=
 are in business you should have a niche product or be  in a niche market. =
If the above is not possible, then you have to be in business with some com=
petitive edge. Now if you are starting a business, to capture the market ei=
ther you must have a very strong financial backing and/or have a special re=
lationship with your customer. In fact even if there is a strong financial =
backing behind you, to beat the competition you should have a special relat=
ionship with the customer. I hope you agree with me and  I would love to kn=
ow your views on this.
  To elaborate the point, the special relationship c=
onsists of either taking the person out to dinner/lunch or doing a favor fo=
r him in some way or other or most of the time what it means is keeping a c=
ommission for him (this is because these days lunches and small gifts do no=
t satisfy people). Here the customer does not mean the owner of the Company=
 but the purchaser or if you are selling say technical products, then it wo=
uld be the site engineer or the engineer who specifies your products. Now I=
 know accepting bribe is considered sin, and I am fully aware of the conseq=
uences, I am talking of giving bribes and your views on this and how does t=
hat come in the way of our spiritual progress. 
  You may be surprised to k=
now why I ask this question,but this is very commonplace in India, Middle E=
ast and most of the developing nations of the world and I have talked to ma=
ny many people, either business owners or people in sales (from small fishe=
s to big sharks) and most of them offer the same in some form or the other.=
 Some say to grow one has to do that. Some say to survive one has to give. =
So I am wondering what the correct way should be.
  Please give some detail=
ed guidelines from the spiritual perspective and if I do the same, i.e. giv=
e bribe, will it come in the way or affect the karma of my family members, =
specially my wife . As a sideline, could you also explain if my action can =
affect the karmas of my wife or whatever my wife is today (spiritually, mat=
erialistically etc) and will be, is exclusively due to her karmas.
  If you=
 could kindly throw light on these doubts, that would be much appreciated.
=
   
  Thanks and Regards
