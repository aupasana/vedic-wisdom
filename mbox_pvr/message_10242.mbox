Namaste Sir,

(a) Yes, why not?

Whether you formally surrender the doershi=
p to Krishna or not, it is actually He (or rather his Maya) who is acting t=
hrough us and performing various tasks. If a particular person entertains t=
he notion that "*I* am doing this", His Maya engages in corresponding acts =
and thoughts *through* that person and maintains that notion in that mind a=
s long as possible.

Note: If the word "Maya" has negative connotations in =
your mind, please read it as "Lila" (play) in this discussion!

Of course, =
even a person who formally says "sarvaM shrI kRShNArpaNamastu" may *intelle=
ctually* consider Krishna to be the doer, but have this notion deep within =
mind that *he* performed the task and he is so spiritually mature that he a=
ctually gave up doership to Krishna and what a great thing that is! Well, t=
his too then is the doing of His Maya. She will keep such a person in that =
notion, of fake giving up of doership while still being secretly proud of n=
ot only the action but also of giving up doership, as long as possible!!!

=
Boss, Lord's Maya is all too powerful. Even maharshis and devatas (includin=
g Trinity!) sometimes get trapped in the Play due to Lord's Maya.

It is no=
t easy to escape Lord's Maya. But it is at least better to engage in symbol=
ic actions that pretend that you are escaping Maya, so that it may actually=
 happen oneday.. :-)

(b) Yes, you can.


Best regards,
Narasimha
