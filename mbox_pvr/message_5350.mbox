Namaste friends,
 
There has been a lot of discussion on food. A few quick comments.
 
(1) We are we we eat. Production of various chemicals in our body and their interactions, are controlled by what we eat. Thus, what we eat has a profound impact on us.
 
(2) Much has been written on the material benefits from vegetarianism. But that is not all. There are spiritual and subtle reasons as well.
 
Eating the flesh or body parts of an animal that strongly identifies with the physical body entails a karma. Self-identification of plants with their physical body is much subtler and the karma entailed in eating plant-based foods is much smaller.
 
Especially these days, very cruel methods are used for meat production by corporations and animals are treated very cruelly. Part of the karma for their suffering goes to the ones benefiting from their meat.
 
(3) I heard an interview with a scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) several months back. They conducted an experiment on gorillas. One set of gorillas was fed with meat. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After several months, researchers found a gap in the intelligence of the two sets. The ones fed with meat were duller.
 
Their theory was that digestion of meat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed with nuts and fruits may have diverted more energy towards the development of brain. Though they were not sure if the same thing applies to human beings or not, a balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maximize one's intellectual development.
 
(4) After we eat a heavy meal, we may feel dull or sleepy and cannot focus well on work that requires alertness and skill. That is because the digestive process is using up a lot of energy (also known as agni or fire) and there isn't much agni available for other activities such as digestion of intellectual ideas that happens in the mind. Similarly, digestion of spiritual ideas/experiences also requires agni and that cannot happen well. That is why meditation or homam after a heavy meal are fruitless and we are normally advised to do sadhana before eating.
 
(5) If foods that light up a higher digestive agni (e.g. meats, deep fried food with more oil, spicy foods that stimulate digestive agni etc) are consumed more frequently, agni is diverted towards digestion more often and there is less agni available for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and experiences. If one eats saattwik food that is very easy to digest (simple grains, simple lentils and simple vegetables, all softly cooked with mild spices, and fruits), less agni is diverted towards digestion and more agni is available for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and experiences.
 
(6) Even a big fire cannot burn wet grass well. But huge stacks of dry grass may be burnt by just one spark! Similarly, little bit of internal fire may be enough to assimilate spiritual ideas and experiences in a person with excellent vaasanas and few obstructions (dry grass). A lot of internal fire may be needed in a person with poor vaasanas and many obstructions (wet grass). Thus, it all depends on vaasanas and impurities in nadis and chakras.
 
One person may eat meat and deep fried foods, spend a lot of agni on digesting them and yet make excellent spiritual progress. Another person may eat saattwik food, maximize the agni available for spiritual transformation and yet struggle to progress spiritually. However, the best course of action for one is to ignore counter-examples and be a vegetarian. All other things being equal, that maximizes the agni available for spiritual progress.
 
(7) Regarding Priya's question: Animals have their own vaasanas and their needs. If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor fellow whatever he/she needs.
 
(8) One should eat to live and not live to eat. A yogi should consume enough food to sustain oneself so that one can fulfil one's dharma in the material world using physical body and make spiritual progress. Eating too much food is not good for spiritual sadhana.
 
Instead of overeating most of the time and fasting on specific days, it is better to eat limited amount always. Regular practices are more important for transformation and success, than occasional practices.
 
(9) By merely thinking that god is the doer of all actions or considering food to be god's prasad, one cannot escape the karma involved. It depends on how deeply ingrained that thought is and how deeply one feels so. If one internally feels 100% that god is acting through one and whatever one is doing (e.g. eating) is just god's prasad to one, then one is free.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
