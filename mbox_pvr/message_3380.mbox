Namaste,
=A0
The stories of curses on mantras and deities are metaphorical =
representations of things to watch out for. Please do not think that your m=
antra is not working because it is cursed and that it will magically work i=
f you chant the shaapa vimochana mantra (curse relieving incantation).
=A0
=
Take Savitru Gayatri mantra for example. It extolls the effulgence of the C=
osmic Sun who lights up the Sushumna nadi (subtle channel of realization). =
The chhandas Gayatri is the shakti controlling the entrance of Sushumna nad=
i in Mooladhaara chakra. Repeated chanting of Gayatri mantra with focus wil=
l open the entrance of Sushumna nadi and let self-awareness (Kundalini) flo=
w in the channel of realization. The ultimate goal is self-realization.
=A0=

However, if one does not realize the goal and thinks in terms of a limited=
 I-ness and its desires (good health, wealth, children, fame etc etc) even =
as one chants Gayatri mantra, one will not achieve self-realization. One's =
Kundalini may rise, but will stop somewhere. One is blocked from the "full =
results" of Gayatri mantra. THAT is what is meant by it being cursed.
=A0
G=
ayatri mantra has three curses. Take the one from Vasishtha for example. Th=
e word Vaishtha comes from vasu and means "the purest and the most excellen=
t one". If an impure one, i.e. one with desires of a limited I-ness, is cha=
nting it, there is a curse from Vasishtha that blocks one. If you see the s=
haapavimochana mantra given in tradition for Vasishtha's curse, you will se=
e that it says "I am the light that fills the entire universe, I am Shiva e=
tc". It implores sadhaka to let the limited I-ness go.
=A0
If one merely ch=
ants that shaapa vimochana mantra, it is akin to chanting "Advil stops head=
ache". Chanting that does not stop headache. One needs to actually take Adv=
il. Similarly, one needs to imbibe the meanings of the shaapa vimochana man=
tras, in order for the Veda mantra of Gayatri to work fully and make one se=
lf-realized.

Bottom=
line: Stories of curses and curse relieving incantations for various deitie=
s and mantras are metaphorical in nature. Instead of searching for a magica=
l formula, one should work on one's mental attitude and thinking. Surrender=
 to god and consider all actions as offerings to god. Do whatever sadhana y=
ou can, whether it is japam or homam, for whatever time you can. In the res=
t of the time, keep a close watch on your thinking and eliminate undesirabl=
e thoughts (thoughts emanating from the desires of a limited I-ness) at the=
 root. Expand I-ness to include others - wife and children, parents, family=
, friends, community, country, world etc. Rooting out of conditioning thoug=
h constant contemplation enables one to do a better japam or homam. The tim=
e spent in japam and homam enables one to contemplate better and eliminate =
conditioning faster. The external sadhanas and the internal contemplation a=
id each other.
=A0
When one's attitude is pure, all mantras become possible=
. Mantras chanted by an impure and selfish mind have all kinds of curses on=
 them and give no results.
