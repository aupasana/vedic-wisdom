Namaste,

What about rinas to flora (trees, plants, fruits, etc)? Does it f=
all under Bhoota rina?=C2=A0

Saatwiks consume fruits and vegetables, offer=
 fruits, nuts, wood, etc as offerings for naivedyam, and during homam. Rish=
is and munis of yore performed penance en-route to enlightenment seated und=
er mammoth trees like the Banyan and Peepal trees. 

How should we offer pr=
ayers and repay debts to the plant kingdom? This bears significance now tha=
n ever before, due to urban sprawl where land that inhabited flora providin=
g fresh air, shade and shelter is rapidly being replaced with buildings and=
 such. 

As a bumper sticker aptly put it: The Earth does not belong to us =
We belong to the Earth.

Best Regards,
Sudhakar

Namaste,

Debts to various beings operate at different levels. They can be repaid i=
n many ways. But five different debts and five specific ways to repay have =
been identified in scriptures:

 

(1) Deva rina (debt to divine beings): M=
ake offerings in fire to divine beings such as Indra, Agni, Vayu, Surya etc=
, while praying for the strength and happiness of those beings.

(2) Pitri =
rina (debt to ancestral manes): Offer tarpanas through specific chakras (en=
ergy centers) in the palm, while praying for the freedom of ancestors from =
blockages.

(3) Rishi rina (debt to seers): Study Vedas, upanishads, script=
ures and wise writings and transform one's thinking and attitude.

(4) Manu=
shya rina (debt to other human beings): Serve others. Offer food, knowledge=
, services etc and serve humanity.

(5) Bhoota rina (debt to other beings):=
  Feed animals, birds and other beings and take care of them with kindness.=


 

Of course, one can make offerings to rishis in fire or offer tarpanas =
to rishis (if you see the Tarpana manuals at the website below, you'll see =
sections on Deva tarpana and Rishi tarpana!). However, the best way to repa=
y the debt to seers is to transform one's attitude through study,  contempl=
ation and assimilation of knowledge.

 

We are a microcosm of the entire u=
niverse. Devas, pitris, rishis, manushyas and bhutas are within us. Devas w=
ithin us are happy when undesirable conditioning within us is burnt in the =
fire of wisdom and we are guided by wisdom always. Pitris within us are hap=
py when weaknesses and blockages within are flushed and mind becomes conten=
ted. Rishis (seers) within us are happy when we have a clear vision of righ=
t and wrong. The corresponding rituals and practices try to bring the requi=
red internal changes through resonance.

 

Pitri tarpana is a very simple =
ritual. Find the manuals at the website below. It is ideal for repaying the=
 debts to pitris. While doing the ritual, sincerely pray that your ancestor=
s stuck due to desires be freed from the desires, so they can move on.

Best regards,

Narasimha
