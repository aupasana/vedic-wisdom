Namaste,

I am glad to know that. With practice, it will become smooth and you can 
start to focus better of mantra.

When priests perform homam on a grand scale, they distribute the tasks among 
them. If you do on a smaller scale by yourself, you can do everything by 
yourself. In fact, the latter is better.

In fact, even when many priests do it together with one fire, it is good to 
have one person managing the fire and offerings. If one chants, one prepares 
and chooses offerings and one finally makes the offerings in the fire, that 
is better than everybody making different offerings in fire. Ideally, the 
contact with fire should be from one person. Of course, if each has a 
separate homa kundam, all can make offerings in fire.

Never think in terms of keeping the positive vibrations to yourself or 
within your house. Fire is the basis of creation. Fire rituals are important 
to maintain dharma in this universe and promote creation and sustenance. Do 
homam thinking that you are doing your dharma and have no other thoughts of 
motives. Of course, if you do your dharma by helping nature, nature WILL 
reward you for it. But leave it to nature and do your part selflessly. 
Self-centeredness is an acid of which a single drop is sufficient to break 
the milk of your ritual.

Actually, a homam done under the sky (i.e. in open air) is better than one 
done under a roof (i.e. inside a house). However, when one cannot do in open 
air, one can do inside a house also.

Best regards,
Narasimha
