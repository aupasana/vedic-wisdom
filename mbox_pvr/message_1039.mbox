Namaste,

The mantras in navagraha sooktam are all from Veda, but from different 
mandalas. They are not consecutive. Mantras extracted from different places 
in Veda are put together in one place. So any order is fine. Different 
sources may give them in different orders, but there is nothing special 
about it. It is perfectly fine to follow the order of weekdays as done by 
your local priests. That is in fact the standard way.

Best regards,
Narasimha
