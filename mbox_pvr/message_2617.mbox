Namaste,

Two points...

(1) My definition of ishta devata is the specific deity for whom one has 
done the most intense sadhana in the past. If one does sadhana for the same 
deity, one progresses and achieves quickly.

However, as I maintain always, our understanding of astrological formulas is 
imperfect. It is not at all easy to figure out the ishta devata from the 
horoscope. Though there are guidelines from rishis, our understanding of 
those guidelines is imperfect.

A sadguru will be able to give you better guidance in this matter than an 
astrologer. I say it confidently despite being an astrologer who studied 
various ancient and modern Jyotish authors and experimented a lot.

(2) Not knowing the specific form with which one has a strong connection is 
not as big a hindrance as one may think. If one is not sufficiently pure to 
start with, worshipping the correct deity does not magically make one 
realized. It will still take a very very long time. On the other hand, if 
one is sufficiently pure already, other deities will guide one towards ishta 
devata automatically.

Searching for ishta devata is not like searching for a lost object. A deity 
is intelligent unlike a lost object and a deity can pull you towards 
him/her, if you have an intense desire to make spiritual progress and start 
making progress. After all, a mother or father may play hide and seek with a 
child for a while, but they will not hide for too long if the child is lost 
and confused and unable to find the hiding parent!

If you learn to be like an innocent and helpless child and if you have a 
genuine desire to make spiritual progress, your ishta devata will 
automatically pull you towards him/her.

So I say that one should not worry too much about such things or run around 
astrologers whose knowledge is imperfect or sometimes downright incorrect. 
Pray to whichever deity you feel like praying to and work on your attitude. 
Surrender to that deity. You will be sown your path.

*        *        *

Having said that, my educated *guess* is that Vishnu will suit you. Probably 
Lakshmi Narasimha.

Best regards,
Narasimha
