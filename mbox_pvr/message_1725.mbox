Namaste,

First, answer to Rajarshi: If A gets an opportunity to pay back a bad thing 
to B but resists the temptation, then the payback is postponed. A will get a 
similar opportunity later (possibly in another life). At that time, he can 
either do the bad thing to B or resist the temptation again and postpone 
further. If A becomes a jeevanmukta by then, i.e. one who is liberated while 
living and engaging in actions without any sense of I-ness, then he can pay 
back the bad thing without incurring further karmas. If A got moksha and got 
out of the game, then A is fine but B still has that karma pending. Nature 
will find a stubstitute to pay back this karma to B. That person will get an 
opportunity to do the bad thing to B.

When I say paying back, please note that the action and reaction are not 
necessarily identical, but they are compatible.

Now, answer to Utpal: A is out of cycle as he accepted what happened and B 
has a bad karma. Either A or a substitute will get a chance to pay back that 
bad karma to B later. If A succumbs to the temptation when he gets an 
opportunity later to pay back, he is back in the cycle.

You do something to someone. They pay you back. The cycle is done. If they 
identified with the action of payback, it becomes new karma for them. You 
will again get a chance to pay back them again. If you do (and identify with 
the action), you are back in the cycle. And so on.

It is quite complex. But the key to getting out of the cycle is: accepting 
what happens to you, being good to others and overcoming ego and the sense 
of "I am doing".

*        *        *

Karma is not just good and bad things we do to people. It is also the 
thoughts entertained by the mind. Suppose you see a nice car and think "how 
I wish I had such a car". Any action or thought that has some force behind 
it becomes a karma and gets a reaction from Nature. When your punya balance 
is sufficient in a future life, Nature will give you such a car, whether or 
not you want it in that life! You may not know why you got it, but you got 
it because you asked for it earlier.

Nature is like a bank which keeps track of your wish list and your debt 
list. It automatically withdraws from your karma account to pay back your 
debts and it automatically withdraws from your karma account to pay for 
things on your wish list.

Best regards,
Narasimha

Namaste Narasimha & Rajarshi,

I wish to add or say Echo the same thing in different words.

Please Consider this -

A Cheats B (Say for the instance that Cycle started now)
Next time B gets the oppotunity and strong desire to cheat A and B does it 
with sense of EGO and enjoys that rvenge.
Now if A accepts it calmly and naturally without any sadness and without any 
emotions of hatred towards B -Now then i feel that A is out of the 
perticular cycle but what about B. B did the cheating revengefully and 
enjoyed it although it was the reaction only. SO WHAT ABOUT B? is he out of 
cycle.

What i am thinking in the above case is that Though B is also out of that 
specific cycle in relation to A but here he Unconsciously gets the 
Impressions stamped in his Chitta due to his/hers egoistic reaction 
(Cheating A) and that Samskaar will some time in future triggered by some 
opportunity will compel or tempt him/her to cheat or do some wrong things to 
some other person and get entangled in to new chain.

I feel that Egoistic reactions gets accumulated in to Samskaaras (Mental 
conditioning) which then never allows most people to break free from the 
chain of cause & effect web.

Have i understood correctly?

Warm Regards,

Utpal
