Namaste friends,
=A0
The verbal root "pU" means "to purify". The expression=
 "pavamAna sUktam" means "purificatory hymn".
=A0
There are two Pavamana so=
oktas - one RigVedic and one YajurVedic.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
The longer version Jagmohan ji referred to is the Rig=
Vedic version mentioned by Sanjay ji below. At the beginning of 9th mandala=
 of RigVeda, you will find many hymns for "pavamAna soma". They are all clu=
bbed together as "pavamAna sUktam".
=A0
Though some people seem to think th=
at this is a prayer for Lord Hanuman, I am not so sure. Because wind and fi=
re purify (by moving away dirt or by burning it), two of the meanings of "p=
avamAna" are wind and fire. Because Hanuman is a son of the wind god, he is=
 called "pavamAna suta". So some people may have guessed that these hymns a=
re for Lord Hanuman.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=
=A0
In any case, the deity mentioned in RigVeda itself is "pavamAna soma". =
Soma is the celestial substance, flow of which causes pure and uninterrupte=
d bliss. It is not alcohol or a special herb or a special brew made with sp=
ecial herbs, as speculated by some with a conditioning that puts heavy stre=
ss on physical matter. Soma is a substance of the inner subtle (and not phy=
sical) body.
=A0
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa once told drunkard thespian Girish=
 that Hari's name gave him a much greater intoxication than any wine could.=
 When mind overcomes its fascination for irrelevant and trivial things surr=
ounding us and focuses on god, the divine intoxication that occurs in such =
a mind is due to the flow of "soma". Soma is basically a devotee's awarenes=
s of the divine that makes consciousness forget other things and gives blis=
s.
=A0
This sookta is for the purificatory aspect of that soma. Swami Dayan=
anda Saraswati of Arya Samaj said in his Hindi commentary (http://www.aryas=
amajjamnagar.org/rugveda_v5/rugveda.htm) that these hymns are for "soumya s=
vabhAv paramAtmA", i.e. gentle natured supreme Lord. That is a far better i=
nterpretation than saying it is for Lord Hanuman, but a more correct interp=
retation would be that these hymns are for the purificatory aspects of a de=
votee's awareness of divine.

As we contemplate god (as a being in the sky with so and so great=
 qualities and abilities or as a concept that expresses in all people and b=
eings around us as so and so great qualities or abilities), taking mind awa=
y from trivial aspects of this cosmos that have a crippling effect on mind,=
 mind will be intoxicated with divine bliss. That divine bliss is very pote=
nt and purifies our consciousness further and that process is described in =
these hymns.
=A0

For ex=
ample, take RV 9.1.1-2: "svAdiShThayA madiShThayA pavasva soma dhArayA. ind=
rAya pAtave sutaH.. rakShohA vishvacarShaNirabhi yonimayohatam. druNA sadha=
sthamAsadat.."
=A0
Translation: "O Soma (soma)! Purify (pavasva) by delicio=
us (svAdiShThayA) and intoxicating (madiShThayA) stream (dhArayA). This ext=
raction (sutaH) is for sharpening the inner senses (indrAya pAtave) . Destr=
oyer of demonic qualities (rakShohA), seer of the entire cosmos (vishvacarS=
haNiH), quickly (druNA) reached (Asadat) the single source of all (abhiyoni=
m), a wretched manifestation (ayohatam) and the one that is common to all (=
sadhastham)"
=A0
[Note: The word ayohatam literally means heated and beaten=
 iron, i.e. a specific shape made with iron (as opposed to gold). It stands=
 for a wretched being.]
=A0
Basically, a mind intoxicated with the bliss of=
 the awareness of divine, has sharpened inner senses and sees divine essenc=
e permeating entire cosmos.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=

=A0
Soma is obviously not talking about intoxication coming from alco=
hol or any physical substances as speculated by some misguided commentators=
, but the divine intoxication as Ramakrishna called. Soma is the awareness =
of divine in a devotee's mind. It is indeed intoxicating and purifying. In =
Yogic terminology, it is related to Ida nadi of subtle body, i.e. lunar cha=
nnel of feeling (soma also means Moon). When devoted awareness of divine fl=
ows in the channel of feeling, it gives bliss, nourishes and purifies one. =
THAT process is described in detail in this set of hymns.

In general, most commentaries on Ved=
a are quite superficial. The one by Swami Dayananda Saraswati (http://www.a=
ryasamajjamnagar.org/rigvedabook.htm) is somewhat reasonable. But the most =
intelligent commentary we have is the one by Sri Aurobindo ("Secret of Veda=
"). Though he did not comment on all hymns and covered just a few, he left =
enough food for thought for us to proceed on our own.

The YajurVedic pavamAna sUktam is short=
 and known as 
puNyAhavAchanam. It is the short one starting with "hiraNya =
varNAH 
shucayaH" as Jagmohan ji mentioned. It is used for purificatory pur=
poses
 at temples and also for purifying a kalasha (water pot) before any 
=
major ritual in which a deity is invoked in kalasha. For example, I 
chant =
it at the end of Varuna pooja at the beginning of our monthly 
Satya Naraya=
na pooja on Full Moon nights. It basically requests the 
essence of various=
 deities, rishis and celestial beings to purify the 
kalasha.

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Questions regarding Pavaman=
a Suktam... 

Namaste, 

I have a confusion regarding Pavamana Sukta. Which=
 is real Pavamana Sukta? Is it the one which starts with "Hiranyavarnaaha S=
huchayaha Pavakaaha..." which is also known as "Punyahvachan"? But when I d=
ownloaded a few audio for the same - those are longer verses. So my questio=
ns are: 
1. Which one is the correct Pavamana Sukta? 
2. Where can I find t=
he text of the same? 
3. For which deity is it used? 

regards, 

Jagmohan
