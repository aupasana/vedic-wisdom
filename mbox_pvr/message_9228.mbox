Namaste friends,
=A0
Good question. Let me give my opinion.

=A0
BACKGROUND=
:

=A0
There are 5 nasals (anunasikas) in Sanskrita - at the end of each gr=
oup (ka-group, cha-group etc). Bindu becomes m before p, ph, b, bh (e.g. sA=
mba, Arambha), n before t, th, d, dh (e.g. anta, sundara), N before T, Th, =
D, Dh (e.g. kaNTaka, brahmANDa).
=A0
There is no nasal corresponding to y, =
r, l, v, sh, Sh, s, h.As someone else said before, bindu is supposed to bec=
ome this gum/gam thing when followed by them. However, what is supposed to =
be a single consonant (nasal) with no life (vowel) of its own and hanging o=
n as an extension at the end of the previous syllable, now becomes a full s=
yllable by itself - a consonant (g), an vowel (u or a or something in betwe=
en) and a nasal (m). It changes the chhandas (metre) by adding an extra syl=
lable. It makes absolutely no sense to me. It is definitely wrong.
=A0
MY T=
HEORY:

=A0
There can be a clue in another tradition in some parts of India=
. The bindu M followed by h in narasiMha or siMhAsan is pronounced by some =
as "ngh" (i.e. narasingha, singhAsan).
=A0
Combining these 2 data points, m=
y theory is that the first nasal, which comes before g, is supposed to be u=
sed before y, r, l, v, sh, Sh, s and h. Over centuries, things got corrupte=
d in Veda chanting and people started saying gum and gam.
=A0
PRACTICAL TIP=
:

=A0
If you take "saMhitA sandhiH" in atharvasheerShaM, I pronounce M as =
the nasal before (g). The only way we can trick our brains to pronounce tha=
t nasal sound is to pronounce it with "g" or "k" following it (as the n sou=
nd in "king", "monkey"). So start pronouncing as though you are going to sa=
y "sanghitA", but skip saying "g" at the VERY LAST moment and jump to hitA.=
 If you skip too early, your brain may not pronounce the nasal correctly. I=
f you skip too late, some amount of g sound may creep in and make it incorr=
ect.

=A0
So you are effectively pronouncing "san(g)hitA", where the sound =
in brackets is not pronounced (silent). If this is too complex for you, I s=
uggest saying "samhitA" or even "sanhitA". It is better than saying "saguMh=
itA" and messing up metre and rhythm.
=A0
Similarly, suppose you have "aMsh=
uH". People say this as "agumshuH". Instead of that, it is better to just p=
ronounce the bindu (M) as m or n and make this "amshuH" or "anshuH". But th=
e best IMHO is to pronounce it as "an(g)shuH". Start pronouncing as though =
it is "angshuH" and skip over g at the last moment.

=A0
I suggest that thi=
s used to be the correct way to pronounce Veda mantras and people misunders=
tood some notations and errors crept in. Similarly, traditions like "narasi=
ngha" and "singhAsan" evolved due to errors creeping in in actually skippin=
g g.

=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
OTHER ERRORS:=

=A0
There are many other common errors in the pronunciation of Sanskrita -=
 even Veda. While I am not an authority, I trust my common sense and am con=
fident that what people are saying now is incorrect. Whether the alternativ=
e I propose is correct or not, common practices are definitely incorrect.
=
=A0
For example, the lifeless consonant hanging on as an extension at the e=
nd of the previous syllable (e.g. t at the end of "prachodayAt") is given l=
ife and made into a separate consonant when it occurs at the end of a line.=
 The word "prachodayAt" is pronounced as "prachodayAtU" by many scholars.Th=
is alters chhandas and makes it meaningless too. 
=A0
Probably some guru di=
d it in the past so that his sishyas could hear the last consonant better a=
nd sishyas learnt it that way and propagated that way. A lifeless consonant=
 is too transient to hear clearly, i.e. prachodayAt, prachodayAk and pracho=
dayAp sound pretty much the same to ears without super-fine attention. So a=
 teacher may intentionally make the last consonant more audible and prolong=
 its life, by adding life (vowel) to it.
=A0
The other corruption is visarg=
a. What is supposed to be merely releasing air from lungs is pronounced var=
yingly as "ha", "hi" or "hu" based on previous sound and a new syllable is =
introduced, breaking chhandas.
=A0
Also, the "ai" and "au" sounds are prono=
unced incorrectly by many Indians, especially southerners. These sounds are=
 supposed to result from pronouncing a+e and a+o (respectively) without a b=
reak. But the way most people pronounce them, that grammar rule does not wo=
rk. If you pronounce them correctly, the grammar rule is spot on!! Please r=
emember that Sanskrit grammar is not arbitrarily decided by someone, but ba=
sed on astute observation of inherent structure.
=A0
Another thing is the r=
u/ri as in rushi/rishi and kruShNa/kriShNa. What is supposed to be an vowel=
 is made into a semi-consonant (r) + another vowel (i or u). That is defini=
tely wrong. If you pronounce this sound correctly and then say a, you are s=
upposed to get ra. The way south Indians say it, you get ru+a=3Drva. The wa=
y north Indians say it, you get ri+a=3Drya. Both are incorrect. Moreover, v=
i in "vikRti" is supposed to be a laghu (short sound). The way people prono=
unce it (vik-ru-ti or vik-ri-ti), it ends up being a guru (long sound). Thi=
s is definitely wrong.

=A0
If you formally studied linguistics and phonolo=
gy, get a feel for the vowel trapezium in your mouth. At its top, you have =
i inside and u outside. You connect them with a line and trisect it. You wi=
ll get i, so called ru/ri, so-called lu and u as the 4 points. By adding a =
to them, you get semi-vowels ya, ra, la and va, respectively. Again, all Sa=
nskrit grammar rules are based on astute observation of inherent structure.=

=A0
There are hardly any people now-a-days who pronounce these ru/ri and l=
u sounds correctly.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0=

NOT SO IMPORTANT:

=A0
While we are on the topic of pronunciation, I am ma=
king the points as I see them and with full force of conviction. But it is =
important to realize that this is only 1% important. God comes easier to a =
devoted dunce with laughable mistakes than to a proud scholar with enviable=
 perfection. Cultivate devotion, humility, surrender, fascination and love =
for god. That is billion times more important than correct pronunciation. H=
owever, IF someone cares, I gave enough hints based on my opinion above.
=
=A0
Several years back, I discovered mistakes in my own pronunciation one a=
fter the other and corrected them. No single region of India is perfect, bu=
t, if you look at everyone and think with commonsense, you can figure every=
thing out. Also, there are ample clues in the grammar rules.
=A0
I used to =
want to shoot a small video on these errors and post it on internet, for th=
e benefit of others. But, with the realization that there are other importa=
nt things that people should worry about first, this fell off my radar..

=
=A0

>=A0
>Some people are confus=
ed with the "sh" sound as in "shiva" or "shrI rAma" or "shava". I want to c=
larify it.
>=A0
>There
 are three s-sounds in Sanskrita - sha, Sha and sa (=
using iTrans 
notation). They appear in alphabet in that order. The middle =
one is 
written in Devanagari script like "pa" with a cross line through it=
. The
 first letter "sha" (as in shiva) is pronounced by some as "Sha" and =
by 
some as "sa" and both are incorrect.
>=A0
>First some background..
>=A0=

>Consider
 the five Sanskrit letters "ka" (k as in in kavi - poet), "cha" =
(ch as 
in chaNDI or church), "Ta" (T as in Tom or Tapori), "ta" (t as in 
=
tantra) and "pa" (p as an pass). Pronounce them in quick succession a 
few =
times - "ka cha Ta ta pa". Note the point where tongue touches the 
upper p=
alate/surface of mouth when
 you say these. For "ka", it will be way back i=
n mouth, near the throat.
 For "cha", it will move towards the front, but s=
till in the back. For 
"Ta", it will move further towards the front and ton=
gue will touch a 
little above teeth. For "ta", tongue will touch teeth. Fo=
r "pa", tongue 
will not touch anything, but lips will touch each other.
>=
=A0
>Say "ka
 cha Ta ta pa" several times and notice the progression from t=
he back of
 mouth to lips. Get a feel for the position of "cha Ta ta". Say =
"cha Ta 
ta" several times.
>=A0
>Now, the pronunciation of "sha Sha sa" (s=
h as
 in shiva, shrI etc, Sh as in uShA, veSha etc, s as in satya, sama) is=
 
very similar to that of "cha Ta ta". In the latter 3 sounds, tongue 
touc=
hes the upper palate of mouth at 3 places (for which you just got a 
feel).=
 In the former 3 sounds, tongue comes close to touching in the 
same 3 plac=
es, but does not actually touch. It comes close to touching 
and there is s=
ome
 gap.
>=A0
>With this understanding, now practice saying "cha sha" 
sev=
eral times, "Ta Sha" several times and "ta sa" several times. You 
will see=
 that each pair is pronounced at the same place. If tongue 
touches mouth's=
 upper palate at one position for the first sound and 
comes close to touch=
ing at a *different* position for the second sound 
in the same pair, you a=
re making a mistake. Try again.
>=A0
>No wonder
 that visarga becomes sh, S=
h and s if ch, T and t (respectively) come 
after it, as per sandhi rules o=
f grammar. Sanskrit grammar is very 
logical and based on phonology (study =
of sounds).

n>Namaste friends,<br> <br>Some people are confused with the "sh" soun=
d as in "shiva" or "shrI rAma" or "shava". I want to clarify it.<br> <=
br>There
 are three s-sounds in Sanskrita - sha, Sha and sa (using iTrans 
=
notation). They appear in alphabet in that order. The middle one is 
writte=
n in Devanagari script like "pa" with a cross line through it. The
 first l=
etter "sha" (as in shiva) is pronounced by some as "Sha" and by 
some as "s=
a" and both are incorrect.<br> <br>First some background..<br> <b=
r>Consider
 the five Sanskrit letters "ka" (k as in in kavi - poet), "cha" =
(ch as 
in chaNDI or church), "Ta" (T as in Tom or Tapori), "ta" (t as in 
=
tantra) and "pa" (p as an pass). Pronounce them in quick succession a 
few =
times - "ka cha Ta ta pa". Note the point where tongue touches the 
upper p=
alate/surface of mouth when
 you say these. For "ka", it will be way back i=
n mouth, near the throat.
 For "cha", it will move towards the front, but s=
till in the back. For 
"Ta", it will move further towards the front and ton=
gue will touch a 
little above teeth. For "ta", tongue will touch teeth. Fo=
r "pa", tongue 
will not touch anything, but lips will touch each other.<br=
> <br>Say "ka
 cha Ta ta pa" several times and notice the progression =
from the back of
 mouth to lips. Get a feel for the position of "cha Ta ta"=
. Say "cha Ta 
ta" several times.<br> <br>Now, the pronunciation of "s=
ha Sha sa" (sh as
 in shiva, shrI etc, Sh as in uShA, veSha etc, s as in sa=
tya, sama) is 
very similar to that of "cha Ta ta". In the latter 3 sounds,=
 tongue 
touches the upper palate of mouth at 3 places (for which you just =
got a 
feel). In the former 3 sounds, tongue comes close to touching in the=
 
same 3 places, but does not actually touch. It comes close to touching 
a=
nd there is some
 gap.<br> <br>With this understanding, now practice s=
aying "cha sha" 
several times, "Ta Sha" several times and "ta sa" several =
times. You 
will see that each pair is pronounced at the same place. If ton=
gue 
touches mouth's upper palate at one position for the first sound and 
=
comes close to touching at a *different* position for the second sound 
in =
the same pair, you are making a mistake. Try again.<br> <br>No wonder
=
 that visarga becomes sh, Sh and s if ch, T and t (respectively) come 
afte=
r it, as per sandhi rules of grammar. Sanskrit grammar is very 
logical and=
 based on phonology (study of sounds).<br></span> </div><div class=3D"=
