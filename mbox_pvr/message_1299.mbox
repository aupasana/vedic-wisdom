Namaste,

When I do Satya Narayana vratam on every Pournima night at my house, I 
accommodate a little bit of meditation in it. At the end of the pooja, I ask 
all people to meditate with the 12-lettered mantra of Satya Narayana 108 
times. We all chant together in one voice 54 times and then we all chant 
mentally with closed eyes 54 times. Usually, the second half when it is 
mentally chanted is a little more peaceful and blissful.

Mental meditation without sound is better. Simultaneous mental meditation by 
several sincere people who have their mind focused on god is very good and 
has a charm of its own.

When pooja is done sincerely, it also creates some energy in the place. It 
is a good idea to close eyes, keep the back and neck erect and meditate 
mentally for a few minutes, at the end of pooja. I suggest a small 
meditation session at the end of rituals such as pooja or homam. When you 
spend some time creating some energy, it is a good idea to let it work on 
you and clean you up a little bit.

Best regards,
Narasimha
