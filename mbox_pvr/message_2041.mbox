Namaste,

I cannot point to any audio that I found satisfactory.

Please buy the book "Mantrapushpam" by Ramakrishna Mutt. It gives Gayatri 
mantra with intonation marked correctly. It has many other veda mantras too.

I will point out a few standard mistakes I have seen people make:

(1) People normally pronounce anudattas and svaritas (letters with lines 
below or above) correctly, but mess up when a few udattas come in a row. For 
example, all the three letters in "dheemahi" are without any lines below or 
above. They have to be pronounced in the same pitch. People end up 
introducing some pitch variation and mispronouncing them. In veda mantras, 
pronouncing all udattas in the same pitch is the most important thing. Do 
not stress any letter or take the pitch up/down when pronouncing a string of 
udattas.

(2) The last syllable of "prachodayaat" is "yaat". It is supposed to be one 
syllable. When you pronounce it correctly, "t" is hardly audible. If you 
artificially add an vowel at the end of it and make it "prachodayaatu", you 
will end up introducing an extra syllable ("tu") and mess up everything. A 
lot of people do not pronounce "t" correctly. Probably some guru sometime 
back started the practice of adding a brief vowel at the end of words ending 
in a consonant, so that his sishyas could listen clearly what consonant he 
was saying. Unfortunately, it became a standard practice. This is good for 
teaching, but wrong for sadhana. If a word ends in a consonant, end it with 
a consonant (which cannot be heard clearly unless one tried hard) and do NOT 
add a brief vowel after that consonant.

(3) Take "dhiyo yo naH". The "H" in "naH" is a visarga (written in Sanskrit 
as ":" and notated in itrans as "H"). Visarga means "letting go". You are 
supposed to let air go from you lungs in a quick exhalation. Pronunciation 
of "naH" is very close to "nah" though slightly different. Again, this is 
supposed to be one syllable. A lot of people, especially south Indians, make 
it "naha". Due to extra vowel added (a), an extra syllable (ha) is added to 
the mantra and that messes up everything. Again this is wrong.

In this style of mispronouncing visarga, the same symbol "H" is pronounced 
differently in "raamaH", "hariH" and "guruH". The same symbol
"H" or ":" is pronounced as "ha", "hi" and "hu" in the 3 words, respectively 
(i.e. raamaha, harihi, guruhu). That is wrong. If you pronounce it as 
letting air go, without adding any vowel, it sounds identical in the 3 
words.

Watch out for these 3 common mistakes.

However, as I keep saying, the pronunciation is only a small percentage of 
it. Creating the right mental images and the perfect mental focus is more 
important. If you lose awareness of your body, successfully shut down all 
other thoughts in the mind and achieve a perfect mental focus on any veda 
mantra with correct pronunciation, it will be a fantastic experience. Please 
note that correct pronunciation is not difficult to achieve, but the other 
things I mentioned here are not that easy!

Best regards,
Narasimha
