Namaste Sundeep,
=A0
I can believe what Gopi Krishna experienced. When Kund=
alini awakens in someone who is not fully evolved, such things are possible=
 during the evolution.
=A0
I described one person's experience in the follo=
wing mail as a reference:
=A0
On Kundalini (Re: Re: Urdhwa-Retas)
http://gr=
oups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/1476
=A0
After the experience des=
cribed in that article, that person experienced a lot of instability with h=
is physical body. His hunger went away and he could not eat more than a few=
 bites. He would feel full after a little milk or a few bites of rice. Jath=
araagni became too low. He lost a lot of weight. Though he did not feel pai=
n like Gopi Krishna did, he experienced the same symptom of low Jatharaagni=
.
=A0
Eating meat, especially some kinds of meat, is supposed to stimulate =
agni. However, is that necessary to sustain body and progress further?
=A0
=
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Basically, when Kundali=
ni awakens and rises, one's awareness of self is getting modified and refin=
ed. That can destabilize the equilibrium of the physical body until the sel=
f-awareness becomes perfectly purified.
=A0
One is normally aware of the bo=
dy as self. When one is suddenly exposed to true Self fully or partially an=
d then brought back to normal body awareness, then one is in a tough situat=
ion. One is aware of the Truth (more deeply than what is possible through b=
ookish knowledge) and yet stuck in illusion to a degree. One has to slowly =
negotiate layers of the illusion, overcome body awareness *fully* and reali=
ze true Self.
=A0
That process can be tricky and it was, in the case of Gop=
i Krishna. Unfortunately, Gopi Krishna was probably not actively guided by =
a good guru.
=A0
The person in the above example was guided by a capable gu=
ru. He could have worried about the body and taken measures to increase jat=
haraagni. But he did not. He accepted that body is temporary and not worth =
thinking much about. He ate the few bites that the body could accept and th=
en did not worry about how to increase appetite. He continued a busy modern=
 lifestyle despite the very small food intake. Whenever he ate a little mor=
e by accident or by weakness, he suffered for a few days with digestive tro=
ubles, but he did not worry about it. Whenever body demanded attention, he =
ignored and tried to focus the mind on god and on his dharma.
=A0
With that=
 approach, he made a lot of progress very quickly.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Take the person of the example in:
=A0
htt=
p://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3143
=A0
All these problems=
 like loss of appetite, lack of sleep etc are similar, in that they distrac=
t the mind from its path and force it to think about the body and do someth=
ing about it. As one's self-awareness expands, these are tests that try to =
restrict it and see if one can realize Self fast or needs to slow down.
=A0=

ANY notion that "I am the body" or "I am doing this" or "I need to do this=
" acts as a seed and results in a tree with many branches, leaves, flowers =
and fruits, in no time. A single binding notion is enough to bind one in mi=
llions of chains in a split second. A yogi wanting to realize Self should n=
ot give scope to even a single binding notion.
=A0
Self-realization is to r=
ealize god as the doer of All things, overcome those notions fully and enga=
ge in actions spontaneously without those notions. As one makes spiritual p=
rogress, one may be placed in more and more difficult situations that provo=
ke such notions in one. One can either remain steadfast in one's journey to=
wards Self-realization or one can take small diversions and come back later=
.
=A0
Different people pick different approaches and progress at different =
speeds and reach different points of realization. There is no single path. =
But each path takes its own time and may take to a slightly different place=
.
=A0
I disagree that eating meat is necessary at certain stages of spiritu=
al evolution. That was simply the path taken by some. There were many whose=
 Kundalini reached Sahasrara without that.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
If you are learning batting in cricket, it is a go=
od idea to learn how to strike the ball with a straight bat. If you start p=
laying cross-batted from the beginning, it is likely that you will not do w=
ell. Of course, there may be someone like Virender Sehwag who hits cross-ba=
tted and yet accumulates centuries and double centuries. But he is a risky =
role model. One taking Tendulkar or Dravid as a role model is more likely t=
o develop better technique and progress faster.
=A0
If you need a score a s=
ix to win a match and a cross-batted shot is the only way, perhaps you can =
consider it. But do not plan cross-batted shots as your staple. More import=
antly, do not claim that one cannot score big runs without cross-batted sho=
ts.

      Dear Narasimhaji,



In some cases, especiall=
y on the Kundalini-yoga path, it has been suggested that eating meat is act=
ually required to sustain the body at its current level of spiritual develo=
pment. The specific person I have in mind is Pandit Gopi Krishna (http://ww=
w.om- guru.com/ html/saints/ gopi.html), the most well known person in mode=
rn times to have raised his Kundalini, and documented it. In his book, it i=
s clearly indicated that at one point, he was virtually at the point of dea=
th and was saved when he ate (probably several times - maybe even consisten=
tly after that) some Kashmiri meat dish. I dont have the book in front of m=
e, but he had indicated that at that stage of development, he could barely =
eat a few spoonfuls of rice and some milk (in the entire day), after which =
he was immediately enveloped in some sort of searing pain related to Kundal=
ini. But upon eating the Kashmiri meat dish, the pain subsided, his appetit=
e increased, and he was quickly on the road
 to recovery. You might dismiss=
 his level of spiritual development, but if you simply read the link about =
his experiences, it might make you think twice about that conclusion..



S=
eparately, I have heard from some "enlightened" Buddhist types, who didnt k=
now anything about Gopi Krishna, also say the same thing. 



I'm only thro=
wing in this information into the mix - I havent formed a strong opinion my=
self..



Regards,



Sundeep
