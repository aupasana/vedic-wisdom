Witho=
ut discharging one's dharma, Nature will not allow one to attain moksha. Mo=
ksha (liberation) is attained when one is free from desires, attachments, a=
ttractions and aversions. As long as there are some karmik debts that need =
to be settled, Nature will keep some attractions and some aversions alive i=
n the person and keep one away from liberation. Thus, there is a big differ=
ence between following dharma and not following dharma. While following one=
's dharma does not guarantee liberation, not following one's dharma does gu=
arantee not getting liberated and keeps liberation further away.
 
The key =
to making spiritual progress is to follow one's dharma, without identifying=
 with the actions too much. If one fulfils one's dharma but identifies with=
 the actions strongly (i.e. has the sense of "I am doing it" and feels prou=
d), that creates new karmas and new bondage. Any action or thought performe=
d with a sense of "I" involved in it causes new karmas and new bondage. Eac=
h such action keeps one further away from liberation.
 
Of course, it is di=
fficult to perform actions without a sense of "I am doing it". So, to start=
 with, atleast remove an action and its doership from your thoughts once th=
e action is finished. Keep the sense of doership while you do it (because i=
t helps you do it better), but remove it from your mind once the action is =
complete. Normally we cling on to the doership of an action for a long time=
 and that creates a strong self-identification.
 
As an example, suppose yo=
u build a temple. You may do it with a sense of "*I* am doing some importan=
t work" while the building work is going on, because that thought and resul=
tant attachment motivates you overcome problems. But, once the temple is fi=
nished, learn to say "krishnaarpanamastu" (surrendered to the Lord) and thi=
nk no more of it as your work or your "achievement". If people praise you f=
or the great thing you have done, learn to not dwell on it mentally and not=
 feel proud. There may be no need to demonstrate your humility by lecturing=
 or saying something, but, you can just smile and keep your mind from dwell=
ing on that compliment and feeling proud.
 
We cling on to our good and bad=
 actions for too long, by thinking of them ("I did it") for too long. If we=
 learn to cut off doership in the mind once the action is finished, that is=
 a great starting point. The next step is to not have the sense of "I am do=
ing it" even as one is doing it.
 
If one engages in actions without attach=
ment and without a sense of ownership/doership, one stops accumulating new =
karmas (new burden). As that happens, one's conscience becomes stronger and=
 tells one of one's dharma clearer and louder. That enables one to unload t=
he existing karmik burdens (perform correct dharma) without picking up new =
burdens (no new actions with self-identification). That takes one closer to=
 liberation.
 
Thus, I emphasize detached action. Being able to engage in a=
ction with very little (or no) attachment and sense of doership is more imp=
ortant and urgent than finding out what one's dharma is and discharging it.=

 
*        *        *
 
> that is what his "gurus" may have asked him to d=
o
 
Not every "guru" will have a perfect idea of what one's dharma is. As I=
 said, "If one's guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight into one's i=
nner core, such a guru can give perfect guidance". After all, one's dharma =
depends on what actions one engaged in in the past lives while identifying =
with the actions, what karmik debts were created and what mental conditioni=
ng was created. Those things can be known with certainty only by a guru who=
 is self-realized.
 
*        *        *
 
> When a terrorist is doing a su=
icide attack he may just be doing his dharma.
 
That is theoretically possi=
ble, but very unlikely. One who kills tens or hundreds or thousands of peop=
le with a sense of "I am doing it", "I am taking revenge", "I am punishing =
them", "I will go to heaven because of it" is doing an action with a strong=
 self-identification. Whether this act is expected from one by Nature as a =
result of previous karmik debts to the victims or not is unknowable, but wh=
at we can know for sure is that this person has created new karma and new d=
ebts. Any action performed with self-identification causes new karma, new d=
ebts and new bondage. The bondage will pull him in a future life into situa=
tions where one will be paid those debts back.

a


        Namaste

        I read Svoboda's article and I had a few quest=
ion. Theoritcal but relevant.

        He has given the idea of of terroris=
ts. When a terrorist is doing a suicide attack he may just be doing his dha=
rma. That is what he maybe drawn to as per his perceptions, that is what hi=
s "gurus" may have asked him to do, and that is what his ideals/principles/=
books maybe asked of him to do. So from teh point of view of dharma, how ca=
n he be blamed? Therefore, the statement taht "Dharmo rakshati rakshitah.."=
, does not make sense. How is his dharma protecting him? What is he getting=
 in return, other than a bag load of strong karmas to fend off at a later d=
ate, when he may not even be aware why he has this karmas.

        Can the=
re is conflicting Dharmas for one person? Or more important vs less importa=
nt dharma? Swadharma should be situational. Sant Tulsidas's  broader dharma=
 may have been realizing Rama, but as a husband, his dharma should have bee=
n to keep his wife happy. So ideally, I don't think we can ever full perfor=
m every dharma that is expected of us. 

        I believe the reason this =
idea of Dharma was existent in ancient times, was mostly because nature has=
 created various kinds of people, each with varying tendencies. This idea o=
f Dharma was sort of approxiamtion, or the best way to tell men that we are=
 all different and yet we are not incorrect in anyway. This is much better =
than the new ages philosophies which outright deny reality and claim everyt=
hing and everyone is born equal. It is not so.

        The word religion i=
s a 13 century invention and, etymologically, and inherently competitive in=
 nature. Unlike Dharma.

        Also, as Narasimhaji's mail shows correctl=
y, following Dharma is no gaurantee of anything, least of all Moksha. It ju=
st continues the cycle. But what is the big deal in continuinng the cycle, =
it would any way continue which ever path one choses, dharma or adharma. 

=
        A much better way of conduction life, I feel, is maknig a mental no=
te of Karma. To know teh simple truth that that which goes out will come ba=
ck to you and that, if you had not been bad at some point, nothing bad will=
 ever come to you. For an otherwise ordinary person, following a life based=
 on and being on the right side of karma, is much easier and profitable  th=
an trying to find that elusive dharma which anyway won't help one in the lo=
ng run.

        Just my feeling on the subject.

        -Regards
        =
 Rajarshi

<DIV><FONT face=3DAria=

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2> </FONT></DIV=
>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Without discharging one's dharma, Nature=
 will not 
allow one to attain moksha. Moksha (liberation) is attained when=
 one is free 
from desires, attachments, attractions and aversions. As long=
 as there are some 
karmik debts that need to be settled, Nature will keep =
some attractions and some 
aversions alive in the person and keep one away =
from liberation. Thus, there is 
a big difference between following dharma =
and not following dharma. While 
following one's dharma does not guarantee =
liberation, <EM>not</EM> following 
one's dharma does guarantee <EM>not</EM=
> getting liberated and keeps liberation 
further away.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&=
nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The key to making spiritual progress is to follow one's dh=
arma, without 
identifying with the actions too much. If one fulfils one's =
dharma but 
identifies with the actions strongly (i.e. has the sense of "I =
am doing it" and 
feels proud), that creates new karmas and new bondage. An=
y action or thought 
performed with a sense of "I" involved in it causes ne=
w karmas and new bondage. 
Each such action keeps one further away from lib=
eration.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Of course, it is difficult to perform=
 actions without a sense of "I am 
doing it". So, to start with, atleast re=
move an action and its doership from 
your thoughts <EM>once</EM> the actio=
n is finished. Keep the sense of doership 
while you do it (because it help=
s you do it better), but remove it from your 
mind once the action is compl=
ete. Normally we cling on to the doership of an 
action for a long time and=
 that creates a strong self-identification.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>As=
 an example, suppose you build a temple. You may do it with a 
sense o=
f "*I* am doing some important work" while the building work is 
going on, =
because that thought and resultant attachment motivates you overcome 
probl=
ems. But, once the temple is finished, learn to say 
"krishnaarpanamas=
tu" (surrendered to the Lord) and think no more of it as 
your work or=
 your "achievement". If people praise you for the great thing you 
have don=
e, learn to not dwell on it mentally and not feel proud. There may be no 
n=
eed to demonstrate your humility by lecturing or saying something, but, you=
 can 
just smile and keep your mind from dwelling on that compliment and fe=
eling 
proud.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>We cling on to our good and bad =
actions for too long, by thinking of them 
("I did it") for too long. If we=
 learn to cut off doership in the mind once the 
action is finished, that i=
s a great starting point. The next step is to not have 
the sense of "I am =
doing it" even as one is doing it.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>If one enga=
ges in actions without attachment and without a sense of 
ownership/doershi=
p, one stops accumulating new karmas (new burden). As that 
happens, one's =
conscience becomes stronger and tells one of one's dharma clearer 
and loud=
er. That enables one to unload the existing karmik burdens (perform 
correc=
t dharma) without picking up new burdens (no new actions with 
self-identif=
ication). That takes one closer to liberation.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV=
>Thus, I emphasize detached action. Being able to engage in action with 
<E=
M>very little </EM>(or no) attachment and sense of doership is more 
i=
mportant and urgent than finding out what one's dharma is and discharging 
=
it.</DIV>

        <DIV>I believe the=
 reason this idea of <EM>Dharma</EM> was existent in

        appro=
xiamtion, or the best way to tell men that we are all different and 
      =
  yet we are not incorrect in anyway. This is much better than the new 
   =
     ages philosophies which outright deny reality and claim everything and=
 
        everyone is born equal. It is not so.</DIV>

royed to a great extent, 
          <BR>> to welcome Kali yuga and set t=
he tone for it. Arjuna being a 
          great warrior, <BR>> it was hi=
s dharma to facilitate that. Some 
          people he deeply loved and <BR=
>> respected were on the other side 
          and it was his dharma to =
kill them.<BR>> <BR>> When the same 
          Arjuna was born again =
in the 19th century as one of <BR>> 
          Ramakrishna Paramahamsa' =
s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in 
          a <BR>> previou=
s life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was 
          different in =
this <BR>> new time and place. He was born to renounce 
          materi=
al life despite his <BR>> aristocratic upbringing and live 
          th=
e simple life of a monk and inspire <BR>> generations to embrace 
      =
    a simple life of mental detachment and service to <BR>> others. 
   =
       When he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna 
   =
       <BR>> said), his dharma based on the time and place may be

     something else.<BR>> <BR>>

BR>> <BR>> The 
          tricky question is: How does one decide wha=
t is one's dharma?<BR>> 
          <BR>> Some people have interpreted=
 Krishna's words saying "follow 
          your own dharma <BR>> and not=
 someone else's dharma" in the light 
          of castism. Though the conc=
ept <BR>> of caste (varna) has been 
          there in Hinduism for a l=
ong time, the concept of <BR>> caste 
          mobility was very much t=
here. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by 
          <BR>> killing birds. =
He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. 
          Vishwamitra was a <BR=
>> kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a 
          brahmana and an=
d a maharshi <BR>> later. Basically varna shows 
          one's aptitud=
e. One starts off with the varna <BR>> of father, 
          because tha=
t is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one <BR>> 
          develo=
ps in life, one gets one's own varna based on what one 
          does.<BR>=
> <BR>> Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna's words 
          whi=
ch tells you to know your <BR>> dharma from your caste is wrong. 
      =
    Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas in <BR>> the world. Each 
   =
       person has individual dharma.<BR>> <BR>> Knowing what one's 
 =
         dharma is is very very very difficult. If one is pure <BR>> eno=
ugh, 
          one will *know* one's dharma. In fact, all of us have a par=
t of our 
          <BR>> mind that tells us what our dharma is, but it =
is surrounded 
          by a lot of <BR>> noise from other parts of our=
 minds which tell 
          other things. Thus, we get <BR>> confused.<=
BR>> <BR>> We 
          should make the best judgment combining disc=
rimination and intuition 
          and <BR>> decide what is our dharma =
and follow it sincerely. We may 
          err, but doing <BR>> the best=
 we can is all that we can do!<BR>> 
          <BR>> More than follow=
ing dharma, what is of utmost importance is 
          to engage in <BR>>=
; actions without identification. *That* alone 
          ensures that we a=
re not <BR>> accumulating new karmas, i.e. not 
          increasing the=
 load. We should not build <BR>> too much attachment 
          to what =
we are doing. We should engage in the best <BR>> possible 
          act=
ions (based on our best judgment on what our dharma in the given 
         =
 <BR>> situation is), with as little attachment and 
          self-iden=
tification with the <BR>> action as possible. When the 
          action=
 is finished, we should leave the result <BR>> to god. We 
          sho=
uld not think "I did it", "what will happen now", "will it <BR>> 
      =
    work" etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through 
 =
         <BR>> unattached action) will simplify our ego and purify our 
=
          consciousness slowly. <BR>> As we become purer, our mind will =
work 
          sharper and tell our dharma clearer. <BR>> There is a po=
sitive 
          feedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our <BR>=
> dharma 
          clearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. =
This is not easy, 
          <BR>> but not as difficult as people think.=
<BR>> <BR>> The 
          bottomline is: Even if one is not followin=
g one's dharma, one's sense 
          of <BR>> "this is my dharma" gets=
 refined with time if one engages 
          in action with <BR>> little=
 attachment.<BR>> <BR>>

<BR>> In 
          deciding one's dharma, one's intellect and intuition=
 are the inputs. 
          <BR>> Another external input is the words of=
 scriptures and learned 
          men. One can <BR>> derive one's dharm=
a from them. A special place 
          is given to one's spiritual <BR>>=
; master. If one surrenders to a 
          spiritual master, one can take =
the words of <BR>> the master to 
          determine one's dharma and f=
ollow it sincerely.<BR>> <BR>> When 
          Arjuna was confused ab=
out what his dharma was and thought killing 
          gurus <BR>> and r=
elatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna 
          who clarified =
his <BR>> dharma. When Narendranath (Swami 
          Vivekananda) was c=
onfused about his dharma <BR>> and wanted to 
          renounce the wor=
ld and go to a secluded place to do sadhana, <BR>> 
          Ramakrishn=
a Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the 
          materi=
al <BR>> world and do the work of Mother for him.<BR>> 
          <BR=
>> One who is not in tune with nature and does not know who one 
       =
   is, what one's <BR>> debts are and what nature expects from one can 
=
          err in the judgment of what <BR>> one's dharma is. If one's gu=
ru is 
          an elevated soul with a clear insight into <BR>> one's =
inner core, 
          such a guru can give perfect guidance.<BR>> <BR>&=

          Bottom=
line is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles

      Also, there are no thumbrules to find <BR>> out what one's dharma =

          is. But, one can refine one's understanding of one's <BR>> dh=
arma 
          by increasing internal purity. By doing various kinds of sp=
iritual 
          <BR>> sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and engaging in=
 actions 
          without much <BR>> attachment, one can slowly purify=
