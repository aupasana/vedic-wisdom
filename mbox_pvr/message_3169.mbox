Namaste Rajarshi,
 
It is not like the two definitions are always off by a month. They actually match in most years.
 
According to the definition used today, Margasira month starts when Sun and Moon conjoin in Vrischika raasi, i.e. Moon is in Vrischika raasi at the end of Amaavaasyaa tithi when a new lunar month begins. If you look at the Pournima of such a month in the last 3 years, Moon was indeed in Rohini/Mrigasira or in Mrigasira/Aardra on the Pournima day. The standard definition results in the same reckoning most of the times. This year happens to be a border year where the two definitions are mis-aligned by one month.
 
I believe the error in reckoning came in during the last millennium or so. The birth tithis of gods, rishis and yogis noted from the ancient times (e.g. Lord Rama's birth on Chaitra Sukla Navami, Dattatreya's birth on Margasira Pournima etc) must have been noted down using the "correct definition". It is upto us now to iron out the correct definition now.

I am afraid not, but a good question!
 
There is a different energy around us at different times. However, most of us are not capable of identifying it. A yogi with zero ego and very pure consciousness may be able to identify, but not others who see the world through the colors of their dense I-ness. How can one identify the color of an object seen through a dark window accurately, when the window darkens everything?
 
I was mentioning to a yogi some Rudrabhaishekas that were happening here last month, on the occasion of Kaarthika month (supposed to be dear to Shiva). He actually told me, "Narasimha, this somehow does not *feel* to me like Kaarthika month. There is some error somewhere."
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

IF the setting of Dattatreya Jayanti celebration happened AFTER the error was introduced, then that means the real Datta Jayanti is on Karthika Purnima. We come to know about the Dattatreya Jayanti from some Puranic texts. Not all of them were before the Kali Yuga started.  I hope you understand my confusion.

Sun-Moon conjunction in Pisces begins Chaitra month, in Aries begins Vaisakha month and so on. However, is this perfect or has an error been introduced in the last few millennia due to deepening Kali?

These 12 months were then named based on a main star in those 12 parts. Chitra star for Chaitra month, Visakha star for Vaisakha month, Jyeshtha star for Jyeshtha month and so on. Aaswayuja, Kaarthika, Maargasira and Pushya months are associated with Aswini, Krittika, Mrigasira and Pushya stars respectively.

Today is supposed to be Maargasira Pournima, but Moon is nowhere near Mrigasira. He is instead in Krittika for most of the day and in Rohini in the evening. This is likely to be Kaarthika Pournima.
