Namaste,

I answered this earlier. Nyasa literally means placement. Y=
ou place various syllables in various body parts. The actions people normal=
ly do, when doing nyaasa, are symbolic. Just by touching a particular body =
part (e.g. heart or eyes or nostril etc) in a specific way and saying a syl=
lable does not necessarily "place" that syllable there, just as carrying hu=
ndred objects (thoughts) in a bag (mind) and visiting a room (body part) do=
es not necessarily "place" one of those objects in that room.
=C2=A0
Abilit=
y to place syllables in various body parts first requires an ability to foc=
us mind completely.
=C2=A0
One may do nyaasas before Chandi homam (or any r=
itual for that matter) based on how one was taught by one's teachers. But d=
o not worry that much if you were not taught. Just read them without any ac=
tion.
=C2=A0
The great thing about the knowledge of rishis is that it comes=
 to you automatically when you are ready. Keep doing homam (or japam or oth=
er sadhana) to the best of your ability and keep making yourself more and m=
ore saattwik. Eventually, things will start to happen by themselves.
=C2=A0=

Yes, killing a living being is a sin, but the degree of sin varies based o=
n the circumstances. Try not to kill, but don't make that a hard and fast r=
ule. Fulfilling one's dharma may require one to commit some sins. If one fu=
lfills one's dharma, the good deeds one does may outweigh the sins. Protect=
ing the body so that one uses it to do several good deeeds in this world is=
 one of the key dharmas and cannot be ignored.

      Thankyou Utpal sir, for all the very valuable sugg=
estions . May I ask another question in respect to Chandi path. I can read =
Sanskrit and know Hindi too but not fluently. While doing Nyasa few actions=
 are mentioned which I find hard to understand. Is it necessary to perform =
all those actions while chanting the mantras or can one just keep reading t=
he mantras and ignore the actions. What role does these actions play?

I kn=
ow asking to record the whole of Chandi homam would be hard hence I would h=
umbly request Narsimha Sir, to please video record only the nyasa part. I t=
hink of all the Homams Chandi homam is a challenge. 

Also I live in a hot =
place where dangerous spiders and scorpions are a problem. Most of the time=
 I throw them outside but occasionally when they pose danger we have to kil=
l them. I feel very guilty in doing so. I want to ask how
 much karma and w=
hat effect will one have when one kills them when one is practicing spiritu=
ality. But then how are we supposed to tackle the situation. 

Best regards=
,



Sudha

      Namaste,

Solar eclipse is at Mid-night for US means that it'll not be visible the=
re. However It is still a great idea to engage in a Spiritual practice.

It=
 is believed that Eclipse time is not conducive to do Rituals other than Ja=
pam, Meditation. Japam is considered best during that time.

Another thing =
is that Eclipse time is conducive for spiritual upliftment and not at all g=
ood for any worldly desire so i guess any Sadhana done during that time mus=
t only for selfless reasons without having any other sankalpa. It is possib=
le though that Sadhana done without any worldly desires may sometimes avert=
 or reduce the evil effects (which may have been pre-indicated by astrology=
) of Grahana on one's worldly life.



I think Narasimha has earlier stated=
 that Homam can be done during Eclipse time. So you can do either Japam or =
Homam but whatever you do, please forget about any other motive. Japam can =
be of any mantra and homam can also be of any deity you prefer.



Best reg=
ards,



Utpal
