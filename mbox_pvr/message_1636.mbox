Loyalty does not make one a shoodra. Loyalty can be shown by people of all 
varnas to various people/things. Karna's loyalty was to the person who gave 
him status in society. Status in society mattered to Karna. He was also 
proud of his ability and superiority in warriorship. These qualities do make 
him a kshatriya.

BTW, one may have qualities of all the four varnas in different proportions. 
But one will be more predominant than others. That will decide one's varna.

> Gauthama rejects to teach a boy a he is not a brahmin.

On the contrary, Gauthama taught a boy whose mother did not even know who 
was the boy's father, after explaining that only a Braahmana can speak truth 
like that and not swerve from it even in difficult situations. Rajarshi has 
already answered.

The story of Shambuka does not appear in the original Valmiki Ramayana 
comprising of six kaandas. It appears in the Uttara Kaanda added later on. 
Whether that part of Uttara kaanda was really written by Valmiki or added by 
some mischievous scholars later on is debatable and scholars hold different 
opinions.

Valmiki himself was a jaati shoodra (shoodra by birth). Ramayana shows how 
Raama was kind to people of various castes. For example, he visited the 
ashrama of Matanga maharshi, who was a jaati shudra who did spiritual 
sadhana and became a maharshi. One wonders if the story of Shambuka is 
correct or added later and/or misrepresented. Unfortunately, this story and 
a misrepresentation of BhagavadGita have been used by political leaders of 
India to instigate low caste voters against Hindu gods and Hinduism for a 
few decades.

Ravana did not merely learn to chant Vedas. He understood Vedas. He was a 
knower of Brahman with control over senses. He merely played his role (of a 
villain) in the divine play of Nature. He is not correctly understood and 
what is portrayed in movies and dramas is a caricature. Ravana is different 
from Hiranyaksha, Hiranyakashipu, Duryodhana etc.

However, I do not want to say more on Ravana, because it is not that useful. 
It is more useful to focus your attention on Rama and Krishna and learn from 
them, than Ravana.

If Ravana is what people understand him to be today, Rama would not have got 
Brahma hatya dosha for killing him.

One may have qualities of different varnas, but one of them dominates.

> brahmin (towards Drupada).

Drona wanted to punish Drupada for his untruthfullness. Whether he was as 
angry or hateful as people understand today is debatable. He may have just 
been doing his dharma and not seething with anger as people understand. 
External actions do not always accurately represent the internal state of 
the mind.

Though he himself was a great warrior, he never wanted to control others or 
show his superiority. He could have fought Drupada himself, but he did not. 
Instead, he trained his kshatriya sishyas and made them punish Drupada for 
his untruthfulness. Thus, he was a perfect Raja guru.

He learnt knowledge, especially knowledge of the fiery kind, taught it to 
his sishyas. He showed discrimination in teaching the highest mystical 
weapons only to the worthy sishya (Arjuna) and not all.

The son of Bharadwaja may have several qualities, but he is essentially a 
seeker and teacher of the supreme knowledge of the fiery kind.

*        *        *

One does get a caste by one's jaati (birth). That is one's birth caste. That 
does have a role and it cannot be dismissed. One surrounded by people always 
valuing and pursuing money has a very good chance of growing up with the 
same values. However, there are always exceptions.

Also, one may be under many influences and have many sides to one's 
personality. But some major influences decide what one pursues in life.

Best regards,
Narasimha
