Namaskaram Anna and others,
 
Yes, Sri J.R. is right. I think there is a co=
mmon confusion between the following two valid Sanskrit words for Saturn:
 =

(1) Sanaischara: "sainaih charati iti sanaischarah" =3D one who moves slow=
ly (while Chandra goes around the zodiac in 28 days, Surya does so in 1 yea=
r and even Brihaspati takes only 12 years, Sani takes the longest - 30 year=
s!)
 
(2) Saneeswara: "sani + eeswara" =3D Lord Saturn
 
People mix up both=
 and say "Saneeschara". That is wrong and has no meaning. They should eithe=
r say Sanaischara or Saneeswara.
 
People are scared of Sani, but those who=
 realize that this world and the so-called happiness and the so-called unha=
ppiness are just illusory have nothing to fear. Sani is a great friend to t=
hem. He increases the detachment in them. It is people who are deeply sunk =
in the illusion and do not want to rise above it, who have to fear Sani. Be=
cause Sani does not hesitate to shock them in order to bring about some lev=
el of detachment.
 
Sani is nothing but the discipline, detachment and the =
spirit of hard work within us. All the gods, demons and celestial beings wh=
o exist in this universe exist within each person also, in a microcosmic fo=
rm. After all, while the universe is the macrocosm, each person is the micr=
ocosm of the universe. Everything that exists in the macrocosm also exists =
in the microcosm. Brihaspati is nothing but a personification of the wisdom=
, judgment and discretion within each person. Just as Brihaspati guides dev=
atas, our wisdom and discretion guide the good qualities (gods) within us. =
Surya is the soul. Chandra is the mind. And so on. Each graha and each deva=
ta is a personification of certain aspecty. Like that, Sani is the personif=
ication of the discipline, detachment and the spirit of hard work.
 
Sani i=
s the son of Surya. Surya is the soul. Soul is ever-radiant and full of bri=
ght light. When the shadow of self-doubt, confusion and identity crisis (se=
rvant maid Chhaayaa) combines with the radiant soul (Surya), Sani is born. =
So the discipline, spirit of hard work and detachment within us (Sani) is t=
he combined result of our soul's radiant light and the darkness of our self=
-doubts and identity crisis. When there is no confusion about the true self=
 ("I, you, he, she" etc confusion), there is no need of austerities and dis=
cipline. So, there is no Sani without Chhaayaa. Similarly, if there is only=
 Chhaayaa (i.e. confusion and self-doubts) and no light of the soul, again =
there is no discipline and austerities. Disciplines and austeriries are a r=
esult of self-doubts and a result of the desire to realize self fully. If y=
ou think of this more deeply, you will realize the symbolism embedded in th=
e story of Sani's birth from Surya and Chhaayaa!
 
All stories from Puranas=
 are metaphorical representations of various realities that play out within=
 our consciousness from time to time!
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

  The name=
 "Sanischara" is not correct. It should be "Sanaischara" meaning who has a =
slow gait.  Who comes late .
