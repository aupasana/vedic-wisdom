Namaste friends,

ctions to be like

tricted to the
> amount of freedom the rope allows one.
 
Ramakrishna is a =
master of explaining the toughest of philosophical points using the simples=
t of analogies. His analogies are usually quite apt and brilliant.
 
Yes, k=
arma or destiny (i.e. the result of past actions) is like a rope tied to th=
e neck of a goat. The rope restricts the movement of the goat, but does not=
 determine where the goat goes and what it does! That is upto the goat's fr=
ee will.
 
A thirsty goat may look at a river nearby and despair as it cann=
ot reach the river due to the rope. It may try and struggle continually, wi=
thout reaching the river. Another thirsty goat may realize that it cannot r=
each the river, accept that, look around, find a small bucket of water behi=
nd it within reach if it negotiates with the rope and the obstacles. It may=
 turn back, go, drink that water in the bucket and be happy.
 
While the de=
stiny as frozen at the time of birth (and as reflected in the horoscope) is=
 like the rope tying the goat and the surroundings of the goat, the actions=
 of free will after birth are like the actions of the goat - how it accepts=
 and negotiates the rope and its surroundings to get what it wants.
 
*    =
    *        *
 
Today's actions (karma) are tomorrow's destiny (karma). So=
me of today's actions may impact destiny in a future life. Some of today's =
actions may modify destiny for tomorrow (in this life itself!). Let me exte=
nd Ramakrishna's analogy to explain it.
 
A goat tied to a tree with a rope=
 may go around the tree a few times in one direction and the rope may get s=
horter. It may now be unable to reach places it was able to reach earlier. =
Similarly, some bad acts of free will in this life may tighten the destiny,=
 make things worse and reduce one's options.
 
It may go around the tree a =
few times in another direction and the rope may get longer. It may now be a=
ble to reach places it was unable to reach earlier. Similarly, some good ac=
ts of free will in this life may improve the destiny and make more things p=
ossible.
 
*        *        *
 
One's mind is conditioned based on one's d=
estiny. One's surroundings and life situations faced by one are influenced =
by one's destinty. One will be pulled in certain directions. One may feel a=
ttraction for another person. Another person may hate one an, abuse one and=
 throw obstacles. One may not have enough money to live happily. One may be=
 adored by millions of people. And so on. One faces different life situatio=
ns at different times and in different matters.
 
However, destiny only sho=
ws how one (and one's mind) is pulled in various directions and what life s=
ituations one finds oneself in. Irrespective of the mental conditioning and=
 one's circumstances, one can still choose between different actions. The a=
ctions taken by one are not fixed based on the horoscope. For example, one =
person may abuse one badly and one may feel great anger towards that person=
, all on account of a previous karmik debt. But, when badly provoked, one c=
an either succumb to the temptation and fight back or just ignore and move =
on.
 
Destiny places you in different situations. What you do in those situ=
ations is based on how you use your free will. In some cases, free will has=
 a lot of wiggle room and many options and, in some cases, it has fewer opt=
ions. But, usually, you do have several options that may or may not be obvi=
ous and the action you finally choose shapes your destiny in a future birth=
.
 
*        *        *
 
Please note that the Sanskrit word for destiny is=
 karma and the Sanskrit word for action is also karma. Basically, actions o=
f today become destiny of tomorrow. You will get reaction in future to your=
 current actions and destiny is the sum total of those actions that will co=
me back to you.
 
Each action of yours that impacts other beings and object=
s of this universe will go towards forming your destiny for future. (Here p=
lease note that both physical and mental actions count. Any emotions you fe=
el towards someone else and do not necessary express outwardly will also im=
pact that person in a subtle manner and hence counts as an action.)
 
Horos=
cope captures the good and bad actions, committed physically or mentally to=
 other beings, until the current birth, which are to give their reactions i=
n this life. This is also known as destiny.
 
It does not fix what you do i=
n various situations in your current life. You have the ability to make dif=
ferent choices at important crossroads. The choices you make are your karma=
 (actions) and they shape your destiny for future. They may either impact y=
our current life itself, or become part of the destiny (as reflected in the=
 horoscope) in the next life.
 
*        *        *
 
Anybody who tells you=
 that so and so houses show acts of free will does not understand what free=
 will is. Horoscope is the frozen list of past karmas that form one's desti=
ny for this life. It is like the rope tying the goat. Acts of free will are=
 like how the goat negotiates the rope and moves around within the possible=
 area to do its stuff. That is in the hands of the goat.
 
The scope and op=
tions available to free will can be estimated from the horoscope, but the e=
xact acts of free will are unpredictable based on horoscope. To complicate =
things further, how exactly free will has been used until now in this life =
(which cannot be seen from the horoscope) has an impact on the scope and op=
tions available to free will at this time. The exertion of free will until =
now may have modified the destiny.
 
*        *        *
 
I am not downpla=
ying astrology. Going back to the original Chiranjeevi prediction, the pred=
iction that he would come into politics in 2007-2009 and enjoy some kind of=
 power was made using astrology. When someone is already a candidate, even =
a random prediction of success or failure has a 1/2 or 1/3 probability. But=
, when there are no signs on the ground, a prediction on one's political en=
try in a specific timeframe has a very low probability. Such a low probabil=
ity prediction made 7 years ahead using astrology came true. Moreover, we h=
ave all seen many cases where astrology worked spectacularly. I am not sayi=
ng astrology is nonsense. But I am saying that we do not attempt to underst=
and its shortcomings.
 
When someone's free will works in a predictable way=
, i.e. when one's free will has very few options and/or one reacts to life =
situations thrown up by the destiny in predictable ways, job of an astrolog=
er is easier. But, when free will has a wide range of options and/or one us=
ed the free will powerfully, the gap between the destiny as reflected by ho=
roscope and the actual destiny as a result of those actions may make an ast=
rologer fail.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
