=C2=A0
Dear Narasimha,
=C2=A0
When the sadhaka effaces his o=
wn personality such that the deity of the mantra comes and occupies him, th=
en at that stage there is 
no real difference between the sadhaka and the D=
eity(even if the deity is with the sadhaka all day I would say that there i=
s no real difference).
The difference that one feels is as follows:
One fee=
ls a strange coolness on the skin and on the eyes.
A few repititions of the=
 mantra bring about a situation where the deity possesses the sadhaka and t=
he sadhaka's prana goes upward very quickly( Urdhwa Retas), 
During all med=
itation the sadhaka sees the feet or clothes or hands or face, etc of the d=
eity sitting beside him along with minute details of the room (even though =
the sadhak's eyes are closed).
The sadhak typically becomes dreamless excep=
t for suchaka dreams.
The whole day the sadhaka behaves like a love lorn pe=
rson. How can i again experience the Beloved.
That then is the experience o=
f mantra when it is done correctly.
When the sadhak's personality is efface=
d such that the deity's personality sits there then the sadhak experiences =
himself as that Deity(Devata) .
There then arises no difference in the sadh=
ak or the deity commanding a certain thing to happen( be it what appears to=
 be good or be it that which appears to be bad) . The deity's personality i=
s crucial. Ugra devatas make the person care almost for nothing himself, so=
 self identification is minimised and the person's spiritual evolution cont=
inues.
Remember, there is=C2=A0very little=C2=A0according to me which is bl=
ack magic. It is all a use of Shakti. If your Shakti and deity is a higher =
shakti such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your po=
wer will be that of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana). After the deat=
h of the body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the deity or if he was ori=
ginally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm reserved for these beings=
. 
Attacking such a sadhak brings the full bearing of karma onto the heads =
of the attackers and some people may realise this to their detriment( Patan=
 comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Patan with his Shakti causin=
g an earthquake). Some people may even equate this with black magic. Here t=
here is only action and reaction.(Bit like you attack a normal person, and =
you will get a result of this from that same Atma whom you harmed maybe 5 t=
o 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack somebody who is identifying with th=
e universe and has very few karmas left, then the Universe itself attacks y=
ou, because your attack is not on the sadhaka, but on his identification, i=
e God or the universe).
If people persist in using the Shakti possesed by a=
 small Pisacha, Bhuta, then there is only a little Shakti which can be used=
, moreover=C2=A0then their minds and intellects will not be free of identif=
ication with the body and so their actions are those which are generally te=
rmed as black magic. These people usually join the same spirits which they =
have been using after death, this is not an enjoyable experience.
Imagine i=
f somebody is worshipping Chandika for a few lifetimes, then even in this b=
irth he or she is drawn to that deity and such a sadhak may acheive after a=
 few repitions of a mantra(because of his previous effort).
On the other ha=
nd somebody doing this mantra only in this lifetime may feel that the 64 th=
ings which bind every mantra are crucial and may not acheive in this lifeti=
me.
According to me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let me su=
ggest an easy sadhana.
If one is so inclined, then starting on some good da=
y, do 1000 reititions of the Savitri(some=C2=A0call this the=C2=A0Gayatri, =
but the real Gayatri is hidden) every day, main constraints
Same time every=
 day.
Same place.
Same materials.
Same direction.
As little movement as one=
 can.
Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.
Complete restrain=
t on sex(from the mind and the body, not just the body), reduce food intake=
, grow a beard.
Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels ar=
e empty before you start.
Continue this for 100 days and do this whole proc=
edure 3 times.
See the difference in your personality before and after.
Lon=
g and short , what is important is that life may be short, so do some sadha=
na, and persist with that sadhana for as long as is physically possible.
I =
hope this clarifies some of the concepts which were being discussed.

=C2=A0
I mentioned the above with respect to the need of thousands of mant=
ras and technicalities. If one does not want to command god and wants to be=
 a beggar who will take whatever is given, there is no need for thousands o=
f mantras and all the umpteen technicalities.=C2=A0These thousands of mantr=
as and umpteen technicalities are for commanding thousands of different res=
ults from god. That is why I talked of commanding vs begging. However, this=
 commanding works slightly differently than one may imagine. I will elabora=
te.
=C2=A0
Also, commanding god is NOT black magic. Commanding low level be=
ings is black magic, which can be accomplished even by a person not quite e=
levated spiritually and suffering from a heavy ego. However, commanding hig=
her beings such as gods is possible only for a spiritually=C2=A0elevated pe=
rson with no or extremely small ego. This commanding that I am referring to=
 is not an egoistic achievement. In fact, an egoist cannot achieve it. Only=
 a person succeeding in completely effacing individual ego can achieve this=
 commanding! I will repeat something from the previous mail to clarify:
=C2=
=A0

The universe has many lokas (planes of consciousness) , many beings an=
d many objects. There are infinite karmic interactions possible between the=
m. Accordingly, there are infinite possible mantras. When one is able to pe=
rfectly control the mind and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but =
the mantra reverberating in the mind constantly), then one experiences the =
mantra. This perfect absorption=C2=A0of self-awareness in the mantra then c=
auses internal changes by the flow of energy internally in specific ways (s=
pecific to the mantra) and that causes corresponding external changes in th=
e universe and corresponding karmic interactions between various objects.
=
=C2=A0
Each set of "karmic interactions between various objects" is a "resu=
lt". Various mantras are for various "results". One may term merging self-a=
wareness in a mantra fully and getting a specific result from it as "comman=
ding a result" from god. Whether you like the term or not, it is essentiall=
y that.
=C2=A0

=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
But the bottomline is this: Only a hig=
hly purified sadhaka of very low ego can command specific results from god =
(not for selfishness or even ego satisfaction, but acting as an unattached=
=C2=A0instrument of Nature fulfilling one's dharma set by Nature). Various =
mantras and technicalities of mantra shastra taught by rishis are meant for=
 such sadhakas.
=C2=A0
Those are hardly of use to so many people out there =
with dense egos seeking specific selfish results. They cannot command speci=
fic results from god (because of their heavy attachment to the result, whic=
h is in turn due to their own attachment to a limited ego), even if they us=
e all the techniques of mantra shastra and all the associated rules of astr=
ology. Instead of wasting their time with these technicalities, they will b=
e better off learning to be good beggars at God's door.
=C2=A0
Just pick an=
y prasiddha mantra or a mantra you feel attracted to, without worrying abou=
t so many technicalities, and learn to be humble and surrender to the Lord.=
 Patiently wait for him to give you what you want. Like a beggar, take what=
ever and whenever he gives.
=C2=A0
Keep praying every day or every second w=

 that it is his and that=C2=A0he gave it to you. If you remember him all th=
e time, slowly the dirt in your mind will start to get cleaned. This fixing=

There may be=
 a mountain with thousands of paths (mantra)=C2=A0for climbing it. Each pat=
h may lead to a different spot (different experience) on the top and show a=
 different scenery (result). Expert advisors (astrologers) may tell you to =
use a specific path (mantra) to see a specific scenery (result). But such a=
dvice is useless to a handicapped person without legs (a selfish person wit=

 and sturdy, who can successfully climb the mountain (a reasonably detached=
 person with very little ego).
=C2=A0
Even when you encounter a person who =
has legs and can actually climb the mountain, the stress should be on how t=

take. The astrologers who are bogged down by all the technicalities and peo=

will get a result quickly by doing that 'powerful' mantra are missing the b=
asic point. The power of a powerful mantra is with respect to the experienc=

You can do anyday. Parasara does not mention any day for doing homam to a =
graha.
=C2=A0
In fact, if one wants, one can do a homam or worship to Mars =
(or any planet) every day. It is even better that way.
=C2=A0
If an astrolo=

=C2=A0
Parasara's definition of gandanta is restricted to two neighbori=
ng areas in a contiguous space having a predominance of fire and water elem=
ents. "I see fire and I see water. So there is gandanta" is a wrong approac=
h. One can then call Venus, a watery planet, being in a fiery sign or Mars,=
 a fiery planet, being in a watery sign as gandanta. Gandanta requires a *t=

=C2=A0
In your example of upapada lord's =
tithi, there is no contiguous space where there is a water-fire transition.=

Well, Me10, Ve7 etc theory is based on marrying two diffe=

 or houses in a chart.
=C2=A0
For doshas in birth chart or to get relief fr=

I did not say it is "usele=
ss". Instead, I suggest that our ability to use it is limited and we should=
 take our limitations into consideration.
=C2=A0
The universe has many loka=
s (planes of consciousness) , many beings and many objects. There are infin=
ite karmic interactions possible between them. Accordingly, there are infin=
ite possible mantras. When one is able to perfectly control the mind and *f=
ill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but the mantra reverberating in the=
 mind constantly), then one experiences the mantra. This perfect absorption=
=C2=A0of self-awareness in the mantra then causes internal changes by the f=
low of energy internally in specific ways (specific to the mantra) and that=
 causes corresponding external changes in the universe and corresponding ka=
rmic interactions between various objects.
=C2=A0
However, this variety of =
mantras, experiences and results is irrelevant to one who does not have suc=
h perfect control over the mind to absorb the mind fully in a mantra. It is=
 relevant only to a seer whose self-awareness is quite evolved and hence co=
ntrol over mind impeccable. Such seers are extremely extremely rare today. =
Most people are unable to experience any mantra and mantras do not=C2=A0wor=
k for them as they are supposed to.

Just repe=

think that certain results come when they repeat a mantra certain number of=
 times. That is an incorrect notion. A mantra may work for one person quick=

 Absorption of the entire mind into a mantra is needed for a mantra to real=

A highly learned scholar in the court of a king may be able to=
 command the king and get whatever he wants from king. An incapable one is =
better off begging the king, rather than trying to command (and failing for=
 sure).
=C2=A0
Similarly, most people are better off begging god for what t=
hey want rather than trying to use the right mantra to command what they wa=
nt. A beggar does not need a huge vocabulary or great scholarship or knowle=
dge. Feeling of humility and helplessness, surrender, patience and=C2=A0per=
sistence are what help a beggar succeed. A beggar needs the right attitude =
rather than knowledge. In this age and time, best bet for most people is to=
 learn to be a good beggar at god's door.
=C2=A0
What people today need for=
 material and spiritual progress through remedial measures is a better atti=
tude in begging god rather than a better choice of tools such as mantras an=
d other specifics such as weekday, tithi etc to command a specific result f=
rom god.
=C2=A0
It is worth noting that so many great spiritual teachers wh=
o came in the last century or two did not emphasize picking the right mantr=
a based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasized having the correct attit=
ude - surrender, submission, devotion, patience, persistence, discipline, h=
umility etc.=C2=A0*That* is a lot more important and useful than trying to =
be oversmart with the choice of mantra, day etc and impress god.

=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
One more thing. We have many mantras given by rishis,=
 but=C2=A0the guidelines from rishis like Parasara on how to pick a mantra =
based on the horoscope are very limited. Astrologers today do not operate s=
olely based on them. They use all kinds of other rules coming from various =
traditions. They are not free from corruption and imperfection. Most script=
ures associate various mantras with various results, irrespective of horosc=
ope. For example, irrespective of who is the 6th lord and 8th lord and lord=
 of A6 and A8, Rina Vimochaka Angaraka mantra is good for debt control. And=
 so on. Linking of horoscope is overplayed by today's astrologers, way beyo=
nd the scope of Parasara's guidelines.
=C2=A0
If one has a sadguru, I recom=
mend following the word of sadguru rather than that of an astrology theoret=
ician.
=C2=A0
If not, there is no foolproof way to know the right path. Pic=
k any path (given by an astrologer or one that you feel attracted to) inste=
ad of wasting time and then keep working on your attitude. The latter is th=
e key. As I said earlier, learn to be a humble beggar at god's door. Choice=
 of Mantra is secondary and attitude is primary. If you succeed in being a =
really humble beggar, you stand a better chance of success than great schol=
ars.
=C2=A0

Any prasiddha mantra (e.g. ashtakshari, panchakshari, dwadasak=
shari, navakshari, vishnu sahasranaam, rudram, hare krishna maha mantra, ch=
andipath, ganapati atharva seersham, mrityunjaya mantra=C2=A0etc) can help =
one make progress if one develops the right attitude. Without the right att=
itude, even an impeaccably picked mantra will do nothing.

=C2=

1.=C2=A0Statement 1: *fasting on any day or any tithi* is good so long =

 maybe a bit delayed but will be there.
2.=C2=A0Statement 2: *reciting any =
prayer* will give the desired effects for any ailment we wish to remedy
=C2=
=A0
Is this what you intended to say or did I get this wrong?
=C2=A0
Statem=
ent 1 is an arrogance that the entire Jyotisha shastra is bogus and has no =
relevance as the remedial measures prescribed by Parasara and others to be =
done on specific days are irrlevant and not of much consequence. This sound=
s like another astrologer I had known some time back whose statements like =
this coerced me to write Vedic Remedies in Astrology so that people are not=
 misled but such pretexts to knowledge.
=C2=A0
Statement 2 is an arrogance =
that the entire mantra shastra is useless and the Rishi=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=
=84=A2s were wasting time in giving so many mantras for the same devata, li=
ke say thousands of mantras for Vishnu or Hanuman when any one mantra would=
 suffice. OR it is like saying that we can take paracetamol and pray that c=
ancer is cured. I think I may have to write a book on Mantra Shastra to val=
idate the teachings of the vedic seers.
=C2=A0
I think there is something w=
rong in the way you are saying what you want to say. Please rethink and cor=

[Narasimha] Well, if one can=

[Narasimha] Putting a burning match in a =

My point is that the examples give=

 If one eats food, a good amount of internal fire (and subtle internal ener=
