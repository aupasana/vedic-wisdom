Namaste,

If a basement is completely under the ground level, it is not a great idea 
to have a pooja room there. I am not sure of scriptural references, but I do 
know that basements under ground level contain a somewhat taamasic energy. 
It is good for sadhanas of devatas such as Chhinnamasta, but not great for 
most regular sadhanas.

For most poojas and homas, the best direction to face is east.

Best regards,
Narasimha
