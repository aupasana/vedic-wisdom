Namaste Ranjan,
 
> lot of people are beginning to panic with

merging things about 2012
 
Though 2012 means nothing to me, I believe a ma=
jor change is coming in the next decade or two, in geopolitical equilibrium=
, popular culture, belief systems and values in vogue in the world, dharma =
in the world, economic theories etc. These things do not happen suddenly (t=
hey better not!) and happen over time. More than 2012, it is the decade tha=
t follows 2012 that is more interesting to me!
 
Communism lost to capitali=
sm in 1980s and everybody thought capitalism won. I am afraid capitalism wi=
ll fall too, in the coming decade, and we will be forced to re-invent a bet=
ter ism based on eastern ideals. People talk of a stock market bubble and a=
 real estate bubble, but the real bubble that I am afraid is bursting now i=
s the "consumption bubble". As the western consumption bubble seeks to swal=
low the entire world including China and India, earth with all its natural =
resources simply cannot sustain that bubble and the culture behind it.
 
Ba=
sically, western dominance of the world is on its last legs. Eastern ideas =
will take hold again over the next few decades and that phase will last for=
 a few centuries.

rth and not based

The current dis=
cussion on rebirth has been philosophical and not based on any astrology pr=
inciples.
 
Having said that, there is some data collected by Sri KN Rao on=
 rebirth and available in his book. He gives one life's birthdata and death=
data and next life's birthdata in each example. These are the people who re=
collected their previous lives and gave some specific details accurately, w=
hich were verified by independent researchers. Sri Rao painstakingly collec=
ted the data. The data is very valuable.
 
> What should the astrologers' r=
ole must be, at this time...?
 
As the world changes and sanatana dharma is=
 re-established, astrological knowledge of rishis will be re-established to=
o. No wonder Parasara's BPHS text was recompiled in time for this phase in =
the last few decades and scholars have access to the entire text after a lo=
ng time now! This is the time to humbly acknowledge our shortcomings and wo=
rk on improving our knowledge of this craft. In the next two decades, those=
 who are proud of their knowledge will be left behind and dharmik people si=
ncerely seeking the knowledge of rishis and working hard on it will be rewa=
rded.
 
More than what astrologers can do, a better question is what everyb=
ody can do to make the changes easy. People can do spiritual sadhana and tr=
y to attain a peaceful and blissful state of mind. The more such people, th=
e easier and smoother the changes will be. Apart from helping oneself, one =
will help the world by engaging in spiritual sadhana.
 
Best regards,
Naras=
imha
