Namaste,

A couple of small corrections..

Change dIptve to dIptre. Change paramajyotiShe to paraMjyotiShe. Change 
sahasraara to sahasraaraM.

*        *        *

Lord Sudarsana is a personification of Lord Vishnu's discus that kills 
demons.

Literally, Su-darsana means "[one who enables] good and clear vision".

When we see some things as desirable (e.g. a beautiful person, a delicious 
food item, a well-paying job etc) and some things as undesirable (e.g. an 
ugly person, a rotten food item, hunger, poverty etc), it means that our 
vision is not good and clear. Only a sthitaprajna who sees all things the 
same way and does his dharma without feeling attraction or repulsion for 
anything can be said to have good and clear vision.

Lord Sudarsana destroys the internal enemies within us, such as desires, 
anger, greed, jealosy etc, and gives us clear vision. In other words, he 
destroys our weaknesses and liberates us.

Best regards,
Narasimha
