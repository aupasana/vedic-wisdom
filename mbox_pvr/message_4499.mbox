Namaste Sindhu ji,
=C2=A0
Although this mail i=
s addressed to Narasimha, I had a few points to make since the mail is in t=
he forum.
=C2=A0
and do not violate the fundamental principles of vedic rit=
uals.
=C2=A0
What exactly is the "fundamental principles" of a vedic ritual=
? In my little=C2=A0understanding, it is the=C2=A0goal which is=C2=A0God-re=
alization, which is the=C2=A0only=C2=A0"fundamental principle". Anything el=
se is dispensable and therefore not eternal. Vedas, as all self-realized sa=
ints have told us, are about eternal truths, nothing short. 
=C2=A0
It will=
 be interesting here to point out that when some sections of samavedis when=
 they perform sraadham=C2=A0do the=C2=A0hormam on the palm of the bhokta br=
ahmin. It is called panihomam. Even the fire is not present there. It is ba=
sed on a dictum called " brahmanasya dakshine haste hotavyam" - the homa is=
 to be performed on the right hand of the brahmin. It is believed that agni=
 is ever present in the right hand of the srotriya (one learned in the veda=
) brahmin. There is no defect here. It is as per sastra. Now if you modify =
this and say that homa can be perfromed on the right glove worn by a brahmi=
n, then the problem arises.
=C2=A0
Thank you for the interesting example ab=
ove. But I have a very pertinent question regarding this.=C2=A0 And what ex=
actly does it mean by saying one learned in the Vedas? Can one, who=C2=A0ha=
s mugged up the Vedas and a few commentaries of the same, without experienc=
ing any sort of self-realization, be called a "srotriya"? Does such a non-r=
ealized being have "fire" in his right hand? Never! 
=C2=A0
A real "srotriy=
a" is one who has realized the Aatman, not in words, but in the states of s=
amadhi. Such a being "may have" spiritual abilities of fire in his "palm". =
Anyone else, irrespective of whether he is=C2=A0born in=C2=A0brhamin family=
, is merely following a blind tradition without having experienced anything=
 and thus violating the essence of the Vedas and merely sticking to externa=
l rules which have no spiritual consequence. What use is such=C2=A0a=C2=A0'=
vedic' rituals, if at all they can be called as vedic. That which is devoid=
e of the essence, is an empty shell which is bound to reform or perish in t=
he course of time. 
=C2=A0
Therefore, for me, it hardly matters if the ritu=
al is done on the bare palms or a gloved hands of a person who has never ex=
perienced the Self. Both, are in clear violation of the Vedic essence.
=C2=
=A0
Homam is a ritualistic form of worship and if you bring in advaita vada=
 in it it doesn't work.
=C2=A0
This is definitely incorrect! The vedic rish=
is were famous for doing elaborate yagyas and homas. By extension of your a=
bove logic, it means they did not believe in Advaita since they used to eng=
age themselves in homas and yagyas?=C2=A0 
=C2=A0
Vasistha spoke the Yoga V=
asistham, which is a pinnacle of advaitha princples, and Ramayana speaks of=
 different yagyas performed by him and Vishwamitra.=C2=A0 Does it mean they=
 did not "believe" in advaita? 
=C2=A0
Your above statement stems from an i=
ncorrect understanding of what is Advaitha Vada. As long as one is trapped =
in duality, merely saying that I believe in Advaitha Vada does not make one=
 become so. I can keep believing that I am Bill Gates, but that=C2=A0won't =
make me Bill Gates. Rather=C2=A0I shall remain merely as a self deluded ent=
ity. Untill one actually experiences the state of non-duality, theoritical =
talk of "All- is Brahman" is self-delusion. 
=C2=A0
Adwaith is a state to b=
e achieve. It needs sustained and serious sadhana. No wonder the Rishis of =
yore, who were all self-realized beings - and had experienced the state of=
=C2=A0Advaitha - used to perform such long penances, including elaborate fi=
re rituals on a daily basis. 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
It is not a question of whether=
 it is more elaborate or less elaborate or which is inferior or which is su=
perior. It is a question of whether it is correct and based on what vedic a=
uthority.
=C2=A0
The question is not about being based on "which vedic auth=
ority" BUT, is the sadhana bearing fruits? Is it transforming the individua=
l? Irrespective of which vedic 'authority' says what, if a said sadhana is =
not leading to experiantial knowledge and states, it is useless for a genui=
ne sadhaka. Therefore, the only way to judge is to perform the sadhana and =
experience for oneself! And this is why there are so many who are already d=
oing the homas on a daily basis. Some have experienced paritally, some are =
yet to. And each experience merely rivets one's mind to the sadhana more an=
d more thus plunging in deeper and deeper. A sadhaka has little use for dry=
 theory. That which cannot be experienced, is of no consequence. It is this=
 perspective that any sadhana, not just the ones mentioned by Narasimha, ha=
s to be judged by a genuine sadhaka. 
=C2=A0

2. "What I teach is ONE proce=
dure for those who do not know any."
=C2=A0
Are there different ways you te=
ach a person to fly an aeroplane depending on what he knows and what he doe=
s ?
=C2=A0
The flying of the aeroplane is the same. The way one can learn i=
s different based on the different models of the aeroplanes in which one le=
arns to fly!
=C2=A0
3. "Knowledge of *external rituals* is relative and can=
 never be absolute. It evolves based on desa-kaala-paatra. There is nothing=
 impure or corrupt about it."
=C2=A0
Rituals do evolve around desa and kaal=
a but if it starts evolving around paatra it is a dangerous trend.
=C2=A0
P=
aatra is a product of the desa and kaala, not uninfluenced by the other two=
. That is why these three are used in tandem. 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
4. "The only k=
nowledge that should (and can) be preserved without corruption is knowledge=
 that is *absolute*. Veda, or the knowledge of imperishable Self, alone is =
absolute knowledge. Knowledge of *external rituals* is relative and can nev=

=C2=A0
Sir, honestly, have you ever read the vedas to know=
 what is inside them ? or for that matter the Sayana bhashya. other than in=
 the ritualistic context. I am quoting the above mantras because they are c=
ommonly known.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
This is the precisely the reason why maybe a V=
ivekananda had clearly stated that the available interpretations of the Ved=
as do not do justice to it's essence. Selective words from here and there r=
eally do not prove that the Vedas are merely a set of rituals! This kind of=
 an intepretation leads to a fallacy where-in one celebrated western commen=
tator on the Vedas believes that the Purusha shukta in an example of human-=
scarfice practised in the Vedas. I am sure you will disagree with this. 
=
=C2=A0
Can you kindly enlighten us, why is Usha accorded an elevated status=
? Usha is merely a dawn. What is so big deal about an average dawn, so much=
 so that one needs to address hymns to it? Or for that matter other pantheo=
n of Vedic deities from the Rig Vedas, which to the cursory reader, gives a=
n impression of mere nature worshipping pagan's attempting elevated poetry?=
 And if the average word by by word translations or a core ritualistic view=
=C2=A0is all there is to the Vedas, pray enlighten, why is there is a gap i=
n the philosophical structure between the so called pre-historic vedic hymn=
s vs that of the Upanishadic period? And all the Upanishads seems to claim =
all philosphical authority from the Vedas itself? How can this gap in the u=
nderstanding of the two contexts be bridged, unless one takes an allegorica=

Namaste,

 your views. There are many standard homam procedures in the world today, s=

Is that better or is it better to relax the rules=

The only knowledge that should (and can=

 the knowledge of imperishable Self, alone is absolute knowledge.

Knowledg=
e of *external rituals* is relative and can never be absolute. It evolves b=

* * =

Let me cut & paste a section from a writeup I wrote for an upcoming occa=
sion. It contains an analogy given earlier and addresses some relevant issu=
es.

------------ --------- --------
Do Vedas Describe External Rituals

So=
me people believe that Veda describes the specifics about various external =
yagyas. Veda is supposed to be absolute, timeless and uncreated knowledge t=
hat is not bound by desa-kaala-paatra. How can descriptions of specific ext=
ernal rituals be unbound by desa-kaala-paatra?

Though Sayanacharya=E2=80=
=99s celebrated commentary on RigVeda is ritualistic in nature, Aurobindo G=
hose had a different take in his =E2=80=9CSecret of the Veda=E2=80=9D. His =
view is that Veda talks about absolute truths about the inner self and not =
relative truths about external matters. Agni or Fire symbolizes the divine =
Will. That is why it is the immortal in mortals. Its rhythm will devour eve=
rything that is perishable and purify all. While fire in a fire ritual symb=
olizes the divine Will, various offerings in it symbolize various aspects o=
f one=E2=80=99s conditioning and the smoke symbolizes one=E2=80=99s passion=
s and desires.

Metaphor: Vedic Homam vs Aagamic Homam

Notions that so and=
 so yagya ritual is sanctioned by Veda and so and so aagamic/tantric yagya =
ritual is not sanctioned by Veda can be put in perspective using a metaphor=
.

Once there were many people who lived near the sea [Aatman]. They regula=
rly sat by the sea and enjoyed the sight and sound of the sea [absorbed in =
Aatman most of the time]. They described the sea in some nice cryptic poems=
 [Veda].

As people started living a little away from the sea [less spiritu=
ally evolved], someone had to put together some instructions on how to reac=
h the sea. He said, "keep walking towards east" and the instructions grew w=
ith time. People faithfully followed the instructions [rituals].

People st=
arted moving further and further inland and started living in a landlocked =
desert far away from the sea. This generation had never seen a pool of wate=
r like a lake, let alone a sea. They faithfully performed the ritual of wal=
king towards east, but did not find sea. They debated endlessly whether one=
 had to walk one mile or two miles or three miles and formed different scho=
ols of thought. Some walked their chosen distance, found a tree or a buildi=
ng or some interesting object and even became satisfied that that was sea!
=

Then came some great person, whose instincts led him to take a horse inste=
ad of walking and ride it for a long distance [use of other tools]. He did =
find the sea after a few months. He put together newer instructions to reac=
h the sea, which included riding a horse [new =C3=A4gama and tantra].

Peop=
le performing the old rituals objected to this and said "but then this hors=
e thing is not granted by the book of sea. This is a new path and different=
 from the "pure" sea ritual" [pure Vedic ritual]. By now, people did not ev=
en understand what the cryptic poems of the original "book of sea" mean, bu=
t they simply believed that those poems taught the old "pure" sea rituals t=
hat they were used to. They were blissfully unaware that the original instr=
uctions were meant for someone already close to sea and the newer instructi=
ons came from someone who actually saw the sea and knew where they currentl=
y lived and how to get to the sea from there!

Slowly many new sets of inst=
ructions involving horses, chariots etc were taught and many new paths to t=
he sea were outlined instead of just instructing people to walk towards eas=
t [evolution of mantra/tantra/ yantras].

One particular path through jungl=
es was dangerous [aghora and other dark tantric paths involving practice of=
 sex, meat, wine etc]. Though the distance to sea was much shorter through =
that jungle, it was just too dangerous and only the bravest and strongest c=
ould make it. There were cruel dacoits and wild animals [chance of a fall i=
n a risky ritual] and many weak people travelling to sea via that path were=
 killed. A wise man who knew the entire territory well came forward, condem=
ned that path and discouraged people from trying that path. Since then, eve=
n people who were strong enough to successfully make it in that path desist=
ed from it.

As time progressed, people started fighting too much about who=
se path was superior. They were foolish, not smart enough to adopt the orig=
inal instructions, of either the so-called "pure" sea path or the so-called=
 "new" path or other variations, for the changed geography and changed time=
s. Many followed the instructions blindly, hit roadblocks and did not reach=
 sea. Many did not even know that "reaching the sea" was the actual goal of=
 all their joirneys. They only thought they were supposed to follow the ins=
tructions faithfully and there was no need to adopt to the changed geograph=
ical territory and time. They even condemned those who actually went to sea=
, came back and gave updated directions for their place and time, for viola=
ting tradition.

In case the analogy is not clear, here is a brief summary =
of its points. Veda is about realizing self. Vedic deities such as Agni, In=
dra, Mitra, Varuna, Aswins, Brihaspati etc are slightly different aspects o=
f Aatman. Veda describes various aspects of the state of self-realization. =
That is why it is considered the highest knowledge. Other allied subjects t=
hrow some light on possible ways to reach that state. While definitive and =
absolute statements can be made on the actual state of self-realization its=
elf, no definitive statements can be made on how to reach it. Only relative=
 statements can be made based on desa-kaala-paatra. The path depends on one=
's current position!

Great men in many spiritual paths, within Hinduism as=
 well as outside of it, came, experienced that state, understood the curren=
t state of people around them and gave specific instructions on how to reac=
h that state from the current state. Some followed the instructions and exp=
erienced the state. Some instead kept arguing about the contradictions betw=
een paths.

Stop Arguing and Do Sadhana

As the metaphor above illustrates,=
 arguments about various paths are irrelevant and distracting. What is impo=
rtant is to pick a path and follow it. Whether one does a Vedic homam or an=
 Aagamic homam is a secondary issue. The primary issues are whether one doe=
s homam or not, how focused one is, how one=E2=80=99s focus is improving an=
d how one is being transformed internally.

Just as a twenty course meal ea=
ten once every six months does not give much energy to one, a =E2=80=9Cbig=
=E2=80=9D homam or another ritual done once every six months or a year does=
 not boost one=E2=80=99s spiritual or material pursuits. Just as a small bo=
wl of rice and lentil soup eaten everyday gives more energy to one, a small=
 20-30 minute homam done everyday gives a boost to one=E2=80=99s spiritual =
evolution.

Wise Tradeoffs

Suppose the president of the country is visitin=
g one for lunch with 100 associates. One can invite all the 100 associates =
of the President by name and seat them in the room individually, following =
various protocols. Then one can exchange long pleasantries with the Preside=
nt and then offer lunch.

Suppose one is in a hurry and has very little tim=
e. If one still invites all the 100 associates by name and seats them in th=
e room individually following the protocol and does not have enough time to=
 let the President eat lunch in the end, is it a wise tradeoff? Or is it wi=
ser to invite all the 100 associates together and seat them together by vio=
lating the protocol and use that time to let the President eat in peace?

S=
imilarly, is it wise if one exchanges long pleasantries and gives very litt=
le time to eat? Or should one cut short on the pleasantries and give more t=
ime to eat?

In a fire ritual, making offerings to the main deity is the pr=
imary part. Various upacharas done to the deity before the offerings commen=
ce is secondary. Various preliminary and final steps and offerings to assoc=
iate deities are tertiary. If one has a few hours for the fire ritual, one =
can do everything given in scriptures leisurely. If one has only 20-30 minu=
tes, one needs to make wise tradeoffs and maximize the benefit. It is far b=
etter than doing nothing.

<sections deleted>

Proof of the Pudding

At thi=
s time, more than hundred people are doing a homam to some deity or the oth=
er, everyday. Spending time worshipping god in fire for 20-30 min (or more)=
 everyday, with an attitude of surrender and with some basic intellectual u=
nderstanding of the absolute truths expounded by Veda and Upanishads, can d=
o a world of good to one=E2=80=99s spiritual evolution. The proof of the pu=
dding is in eating it. One can try to perform a short homam everyday for a =
few months and see for oneself if there is a difference in one=E2=80=99s at=
titude, focus and clarity of thinking.

<DIV><EM><=
/EM> </DIV>
<DIV>What exactly is the "fundamental principles" of a ved=
ic ritual? In my little understanding, it is the goal which is&nb=
sp;God-realization, which is the only "fundamental principle". An=
ything else is dispensable and therefore not eternal. Vedas, as all self-re=
alized saints have told us, are about eternal truths, nothing short. </DIV>=

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV><EM>It will be interesting here to point out that w=
hen some sections of samavedis when they perform sraadham do the =
hormam on the palm of the bhokta brahmin. It is called panihomam. Even the =
fire is not present there. It is based on a dictum called " brahmanasya dak=
shine haste hotavyam" - the homa is to be performed on the right hand of th=
e brahmin. It is believed that agni is ever present in the right hand of th=
e srotriya (one learned in the veda) brahmin. There is no defect here. It i=
s as per sastra. Now if you modify this and say that homa can be perfromed =
on the right glove worn by a brahmin, then the problem arises.</EM></DIV>
<=
DIV><EM></EM> </DIV>
<DIV>Thank you for the interesting example above.=
 But I have a very pertinent question regarding this.  And what exactl=
y does it mean by saying one learned in the Vedas? Can one, who has mu=
gged up the Vedas and a few commentaries of the same, without experiencing =
any sort of self-realization, be called a "srotriya"? Does such a non-reali=
zed being have "fire" in his right hand? Never! </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<D=
IV>A real "srotriya" is one who has <EM>realized </EM>the Aatman, not in wo=
rds, but in the states of samadhi. Such a being "may have" spiritual abilit=
ies of fire in his "palm". Anyone else, irrespective of whether he is =
born in brhamin family, is merely following a blind tradition without =
having experienced anything and thus violating the essence of the Vedas and=
 merely sticking to external rules which have no spiritual consequence. Wha=
t use is such a 'vedic' rituals, if at all they can be called as =
vedic. That which is devoide of the essence, is an empty shell which is bou=
nd to reform or perish in the course of time. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV=
>Therefore, for me, it hardly matters if the ritual is done on the bare pal=
ms or a gloved hands of a person who has never experienced the Self. Both, =
are in clear violation of the Vedic essence.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV><=
EM>Homam is a ritualistic form of worship and if you bring in advaita vada =
in it it doesn't work.</EM></DIV>
<DIV><EM></EM> </DIV>
<DIV>This is d=
efinitely incorrect! The vedic rishis were famous for doing elaborate yagya=
s and homas. By extension of your above logic, it means they did not believ=
e in Advaita since they used to engage themselves in homas and yagyas? =
; </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Vasistha spoke the Yoga Vasistham, which is=
 a pinnacle of advaitha princples, and Ramayana speaks of different yagyas =
performed by him and Vishwamitra.  Does it mean they did not "believe"=
 in advaita? </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Your above statement stems from =
an incorrect understanding of what is Advaitha Vada. As long as one is trap=
ped in duality, merely saying that I believe in Advaitha Vada does not make=
 one become so. I can keep believing that I am Bill Gates, but that wo=
n't make me Bill Gates. Rather I shall remain merely as a self deluded=

<D=

. No wonder the Rishis of yore, who were all self-realized beings - and had=

<DIV> </D=

<DIV><EM></EM> </DIV>
<DIV><EM>It is not a question of whether it =
is more elaborate or less elaborate or which is inferior or which is superi=
or. It is a question of whether it is correct and based on what vedic autho=
rity.</EM></DIV>
<DIV><EM></EM> </DIV>
<DIV>The question is not about =
being based on "which vedic authority" BUT, is the sadhana bearing fruits? =
Is it transforming the individual? Irrespective of which vedic 'authority' =
says what, if a said sadhana is not leading to experiantial knowledge and s=
tates, it is useless for a genuine sadhaka. Therefore, the only way to judg=
e is to perform the sadhana and experience for oneself! And this is why the=
re are so many who are already doing the homas on a daily basis. Some have =
experienced paritally, some are yet to. And each experience merely rivets o=
ne's mind to the sadhana more and more thus plunging in deeper and deeper. =
A sadhaka has little use for dry theory. That which cannot be experienced, =
is of no consequence. It is this perspective that any sadhana, not just the=

<DIV>Thanks for your reply.</DIV>

<DIV>1. "There are=
 many standard homam procedures in the world today, some more elaborate tha=
n what we teach and some more brief. " - </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Plea=
se clarify whether the homa procedure taught by you belongs to the vedic sy=
stem. If so, which authoritative text have you relied upon? Or is it one de=
signed by yourself keeping the convenience factor in mind ?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbs=
p;</DIV>
<DIV>There are many procedures even within the vedic system for pe=
rforming homam. Each established procedure given by acharyas  is compl=
ete in itself and do not violate the fundamental principles of vedic r=
ituals.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>It will be interesting here to point o=
ut that when some sections of samavedis when they perform sraadham do =
the hormam on the palm of the bhokta brahmin. It is called panihomam. =
Even the fire is not present there. It is based on a dictum called " brahma=
nasya dakshine haste hotavyam" - the homa is to be performed on the right h=
and of the brahmin. It is believed that agni is ever present in the right h=

<DIV>"In my well-considered view, Sanjay ji got some specific secret=

paramparas) from his elders. He then read some books and formed his underst=
anding. As he started teaching it, he received a lot of adulation for the "=
parampara secrets". I am afraid he got addicted to the adulation and starte=
d to manufacture "parampara secrets" after the initial run. Slowly he becam=
e commercial and he started selling manufactured "parampara knowledge".</DI=

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Yes, his teachings contain fascinating philosophi=
zation, which is really superficial and does not stand any real scrutiny. H=
is theories are like beautiful structures built with a pack of cards. Sanja=
y ji always maintains an air of "I know more, but will teach later". It is =
convenient to give the impression that there is more. If anything does not =
make sense, it could be because you have to learn more!</DIV>
<DIV> </=

<DIV>As he started exploiting and commercializing half-baked and ill-c=
onceived knowledge in the name of a parampara, I took an exception to the c=
ommercialization and dishonesty. After expressing my reservations privately=
 and having no effect, I started to go public, first subtly and later blunt=
ly. After several clashes, I was kicked out of SJC.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>=

<DIV>With basic concepts like houses, arudha padas, chara karakas, argalas=
 etc, the generic guidelines he received are imperfect. He deviates from Pa=
rasara in several matters and his teachings do not work consistently.</DIV>=

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Bottomline: Sanjay ji's base is made of some specif=
ic secrets (that are imperfect) and some generic guidelines (that are imper=
fect too). Starting from that base and reading books, he hastily created a =
body of knowledge which he sells now. If there is anything in his teachings=

<DIV>Namaste,<BR><BR>Thanks for your views. There are many standard=
 homam procedures in the world today, some more elaborate than what we teac=
h and some more brief. I do not care exactly what procedure one uses and I =
will be happy if more and more people do homam *regularly*, irrespective of=
 the exact procedure used! What I teach is ONE procedure for those who do n=
ot know any. If you are initiated into a different procedure that you can d=
o daily, please go ahead and do it daily the way you know it. That will mak=
e us very happy. However, if the method you know cannot be done daily, plea=
se consider what I taught, which is simple enough to do daily.<BR><BR>* * *=
<BR><BR>Suppose there are rules and protocols on how one should serve lunch=
 to one's parents, e.g. how to place the plates, spoons, forks, soup bowls,=
 drink cups, dessert bowls etc and how and in what order to serve various i=
tems in those containers. Suppose the protocol is so complex that one canno=
t
 do it everyday and calls one's parents for a lunch once every few months=
.<BR><BR>Is that better or is it better to relax the rules and protocols to=
 make it less formal and serve lunch to parents everyday?<BR><BR>* * *<BR><=

purity.<BR>> Hybrids may not always yield good results. Let almighty hel=

absolute. It evolves based on desa-kaala-paatra. There is nothing impure or=

iven earlier and addresses some relevant issues.<BR><BR>------------ ------=
--- --------<BR>Do Vedas Describe External Rituals<BR><BR>Some people belie=
ve that Veda describes the specifics about various external yagyas. Veda is=
 supposed to be absolute, timeless and uncreated knowledge that is not boun=
d by desa-kaala-paatra. How can descriptions of specific external rituals b=
e unbound by desa-kaala-paatra?<BR><BR>Though Sayanacharya=E2=80=99s celebr=
ated commentary on RigVeda is ritualistic in nature, Aurobindo Ghose had a =
different take in his =E2=80=9CSecret of the Veda=E2=80=9D. His view is tha=
t Veda talks about absolute truths about the inner self and not relative tr=
uths about external matters. Agni or Fire symbolizes the divine Will. That =
is why it is the immortal in mortals. Its rhythm will devour everything tha=
t is
 perishable and purify all. While fire in a fire ritual symbolizes the=
 divine Will, various offerings in it symbolize various aspects of one=E2=
=80=99s conditioning and the smoke symbolizes one=E2=80=99s passions and de=
sires.<BR><BR>Metaphor: Vedic Homam vs Aagamic Homam<BR><BR>Notions that so=
 and so yagya ritual is sanctioned by Veda and so and so aagamic/tantric ya=
gya ritual is not sanctioned by Veda can be put in perspective using a meta=
phor.<BR><BR>Once there were many people who lived near the sea [Aatman]. T=
hey regularly sat by the sea and enjoyed the sight and sound of the sea [ab=
sorbed in Aatman most of the time]. They described the sea in some nice cry=
ptic poems [Veda].<BR><BR>As people started living a little away from the s=
ea [less spiritually evolved], someone had to put together some instruction=
s on how to reach the sea. He said, "keep walking towards east" and the ins=
tructions grew with time. People faithfully followed the instructions
 [rit=
uals].<BR><BR>People started moving further and further inland and started =
living in a landlocked desert far away from the sea. This generation had ne=
ver seen a pool of water like a lake, let alone a sea. They faithfully perf=
ormed the ritual of walking towards east, but did not find sea. They debate=
d endlessly whether one had to walk one mile or two miles or three miles an=
d formed different schools of thought. Some walked their chosen distance, f=
ound a tree or a building or some interesting object and even became satisf=
ied that that was sea!<BR><BR>Then came some great person, whose instincts =
led him to take a horse instead of walking and ride it for a long distance =
[use of other tools]. He did find the sea after a few months. He put togeth=
er newer instructions to reach the sea, which included riding a horse [new =
=C3=A4gama and tantra].<BR><BR>People performing the old rituals objected t=
o this and said "but then this horse thing is not granted by the
 book of s=
ea. This is a new path and different from the "pure" sea ritual" [pure Vedi=
c ritual]. By now, people did not even understand what the cryptic poems of=
 the original "book of sea" mean, but they simply believed that those poems=
 taught the old "pure" sea rituals that they were used to. They were blissf=
ully unaware that the original instructions were meant for someone already =
close to sea and the newer instructions came from someone who actually saw =
the sea and knew where they currently lived and how to get to the sea from =
there!<BR><BR>Slowly many new sets of instructions involving horses, chario=
ts etc were taught and many new paths to the sea were outlined instead of j=
ust instructing people to walk towards east [evolution of mantra/tantra/ ya=
ntras].<BR><BR>One particular path through jungles was dangerous [aghora an=
d other dark tantric paths involving practice of sex, meat, wine etc]. Thou=
gh the distance to sea was much shorter through that
 jungle, it was just t=
oo dangerous and only the bravest and strongest could make it. There were c=
ruel dacoits and wild animals [chance of a fall in a risky ritual] and many=
 weak people travelling to sea via that path were killed. A wise man who kn=
ew the entire territory well came forward, condemned that path and discoura=
ged people from trying that path. Since then, even people who were strong e=
nough to successfully make it in that path desisted from it.<BR><BR>As time=
 progressed, people started fighting too much about whose path was superior=
. They were foolish, not smart enough to adopt the original instructions, o=
f either the so-called "pure" sea path or the so-called "new" path or other=
 variations, for the changed geography and changed times. Many followed the=
 instructions blindly, hit roadblocks and did not reach sea. Many did not e=
ven know that "reaching the sea" was the actual goal of all their joirneys.=
 They only thought they were supposed to
 follow the instructions faithfull=
y and there was no n
