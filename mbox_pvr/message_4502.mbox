Namaste,
 
Most of your mail refers to my dealings with Mr Sanjay Rath rela=
ted to astrology ten years back and now. It is irrelevant to the topic at h=
and and to the charter of this yahoogroup. I will ignore your comments.

THIS is the problem. Knowled=
ge of rishis does not exist in disconnected islands, though people of today=
 refuse to see the big picture and have a holistic approach.
 
As I said, V=
asishtha said in Yoga Vaasistham (BTW, answer to your question to Rajarshi:=
 Yoga vaasishtham was Valmiki's record of Vasisitha's teachings to Rama) th=
at the bird of individualized consciousness flies to the sky of enlightenme=
nt using the two wings of knowledge and action.
 
Knowledge here does not r=
efer to the knowhow of rituals etc. It refers to the knowledge of Self that=
 is expounded in Veda and Upanishads.
 
One continuously walking on a hilly=
 path without the knowledge that reaching the pinnacle is the final goal ma=
y walk for ever, go in circles around the hill and not reach the pinnacle. =
One who knows that reaching the pinnacle is the goal and keeps staring at i=
t and remains seated at the base will remain there and not reach the pinnac=
le.
 
Similarly, one who keeps performing rituals without understanding phi=
losophy and the essence of Veda and Upanishads, will keep performing ritual=
s and not reach god. One who keeps repeating "all is god, all god" and does=
 no rituals (or other actions) will also not reach god.
 
Philosophy and ri=
tuals are not independent. Philosophy should motivate our thinking as we pe=
rform rituals.

What is =
"learned in the veda"? If a person can recite Veda perfectly and yet Vedic =
essence does not guide one's understanding, attitude, thoughts and actions,=
 will performing homam on the right palm of that person without explicit fi=
re work?
 
The emphasis on external things and dry scholarship has corrupte=
d a lot of our understanding and is the reason for the sorry state of Veda =
dharma in today's world. Dry scholarship and literal meanings are preferred=
 to internal experience. Imperfect is taken for perfect as it adheres to th=
e letter though not spirit, while things adhering to the spirit though not =
the letter may sometimes be labeled imperfect, defective and impure.
 
What=
 we need is people who may or may not be able to recite Veda and yet imbibe=
 the essence of Vedic teaching deeply in their understanding, attitude, tho=
ughts and actions. What we need is people who have realized god within them=
selves and are guided by the bright inner light. What we need is people who=
 are like walking fire.

Two deductions:

(2) You d=

I have read only some p=
arts, tried to understand myself using my knowledge of Sanskrit and also go=
ne through multiple commentaries. But that was sufficient for me realize th=
at what we have is very superficial. What I read in commentaries seemed sup=
erficial to me and what I could independently come up with, based on my San=
skrit scholarship, was also always superficial. Sometimes, as I meditated o=
n a verse for a few days, a different understanding might descend on me, wh=
ich would seem deeper and make more sense. An example can be seen in messag=
e 4436 at
 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/4436
 
It ti=
es in yogic/tantric concepts to the Vedic verse, just as alluded by Vivekan=
anda (see the other mail I sent today).
 
I refuse to accept different syst=
ems like Vedic system, tantric system, adwaita, dwaita, ritualism, philosop=
hy etc. To me, there is just one system - sanatana dharma or Veda dharma - =
taught by rishis. In their inability to understand it holistically, people =
created disconnected islands of knowledge. But I reckon the time has come t=
o embrace a holistic approach and restore true Veda dharma.

 The ordinary materials such as fire wood, grains, ghee etc. become worthy =

 the offering to the particular deity. If at all deity is invoked it is gau=
