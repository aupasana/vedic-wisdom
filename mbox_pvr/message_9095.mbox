Namaste,
=C2=A0
Some quick miscellaneous replies to a few selected question=
s/comments that came in response to my writeup yesterday.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=

Comment 1: "If the remedial measures can only push the karma p=
hala down to manifest 
at a later date/birth then isn't it a futile=C2=A0ex=
ercise. Why not accept 
whatever comes our way as 'PRASAD' from Isvara and =
move on."
=C2=A0
My response: The final goal is indeed to reach a state of =
mind where one can accept the fruits of all karmas as prasad of Lord, with =
an equanimous mind. However, it is not easy. When we receive the fruits of =
some really terrible karmas, our mind gets so twisted and agitated that we =
lose our balance and our judgment gets badly beated. This may result in fur=
ther bad karmas being committed in that agitated/confused state.
=C2=A0
Thu=
s, it IS sometimes useful to push off some really bad impending karmas when=
 one is still in a position to do so. If one reaches a calmer state of mind=
 in that borrowed time, one may be able to handle the bad fruits better. It=
 is even possible theoretically that one pushes off a really bad karma, mak=
es progress during that borrowed time, reaches an equanimous state of mind,=
 becomes liberated and then faces the karma as a liberated being with a tot=
ally equanimous mind that does not get agitated.

=A0
Comment 2: Prarabda karma is which was already done and sanchitha and a=
gami are what we going to do.
=C2=A0
My Response: Actually sanchita karmas =
are also karmas already done. Sanchita means "piled up". Prarabdha karmas a=
re different in the sense that their fructification has already begun. The =
verb "prArabh" means "to begin". Its noun form "prArambha" means "beginning=
" and its gerund noun form "prArabdha" means "the [one that was] begun". Pr=
arabdha karmas are actions for which the process of reaction has already be=
gun and in the pipeline. Whereas sanchita karmas are piled up karmas that h=
ave not kicked off their fruits yet. They can be delayed indefinitely. If o=
ne becomes liberated while living, one can merge in Cosmic Self without exp=
eriencing the fruits of sanchita karmas. However, fruits of prarabdha karma=
s are already in the pipeline and need to be experienced even by a liberate=
d being.
=C2=A0
Though fruits of prarabdha karmas are already in the pipeli=
ne, even they can actually be delayed or manipulated. Bottomline is that th=
ere are agents of delivery at the physical and subtle level even for things=
 deep in the pipeline and hence some limited adjustment is possible.

Comment 3:How does nishkam karma works? In othe=
r words, when a doer detaches himself from an action, where does the reacti=
on goes?
=C2=A0
My Response: If one identifies with a body-mind complex and=
 a limited sense of self-identification and pursues its selfish agenda, one=
 keeps accumulating karmas. But, if one has minimal identification with a b=
ody-mind complex to just sustain it, pursues no agenda and engages in whate=
ver action is natural in the situation one is in (but not driven by any con=
ditioning, i.e.agendas or desires or likes/dislikes), then one is untouched=
 by karmas performed in that state.
=C2=A0
In the words of Swami Sivananda =
of Hrishikesh, "The accumulated and current actions of a Jnani take shelter=
 in Brahmanda Prakriti". In other words, Sanchita karmas (piled up actions =
from past that have not yet begun fructifying) and aagami karmas (actions b=
eing performed right now) of a liberated being take shelted in Cosmic Kinet=
ic Consciousness (Brahmanda Prakriti).

=C2=A0
Commen=
t 4: If my destiny is to suffer, why should I pray to God? And if i am bein=
g 
punished for some kind of bad karma from the past, why am i not aware of=
 it? It is like getting punishment without knowing your bad deeds.
=C2=A0
M=
y Response: One need not pray to God.All one needs to do is to stop engagin=
g in problematic karmas to add to the pile of such karmas from the past. Mo=
re importantly, one needs to reach a calm and sustainable state of mind in =
which that can be maintained even in the middle of a tumultous hurricane ca=
used in one's life due to serious bad karmas from the past. Once serious tr=
oubles set in or mind focuses on sense objects, material world and one's pl=
easures and pains, mind tends to lose its balance and judgment, starts purs=
uing its limited selfish agendas and starts performing even more bad karmas=
. Thus, praying to God and contemplating various ideals and qualities that =
God represents can give a shelter to the mind in which it can maintain some=
 calmness, balance and judgment. If that is not the case for one, perhaps o=
ne needs to perfect it further.
=C2=A0
God has no agenda to either punish y=
ou or hide the reason. God is an impartial balancer of reactions to all act=
ions. If there is something unreasonable about the reaction you are getting=
, it means your action had a similar unreasonableness.

=C2=A0Let me turn a=
round your question on being "aware" and ask a simple question. When we cau=
se loss or hurt to someone, do we always tell that person why we are doing =
it? If not, how can we expect someone to tell us before causing loss or hur=
t to us? If I caused terrible strife to someone pious and pure for no reaso=
n, then Nature will use someone in future to cause terrible strife to me de=
spite my piety and purity and apparently for no reason.
=C2=A0
In fact, wha=
t will you achieve by knowing exactly what was the action that caused what =
is happening to you right now? Why is that useful? More useful is your cons=
cience (a representation of God in each heart) that tells you right from wr=
ong. It constantly gives guidance on which actions will give good reactions=
 *in future*.

Comment 5: Vasana can be for wea=
lth, fame, power, domination (a struggle for power!) etc.Many ripus, many r=
easons...!
=C2=A0
My Response: Well-said. Though we are discussing karma an=
d karma phala here, the root cause of karma is vasana in chittaakasha. (Chi=
daakaasha is the space of pure consciousness and chittaakaasha is the space=
 of conditioned consciousness that has likes, dislikes, desires, agendas et=
c.) Vasishtha defined liberation as overcoming vasanas in Yoga Vaasishtham =
and Patanjali defined yoga as "chitta vR^itti nirodhaH yogaH" (resisting th=
e working of conditioning is oneness with Cosmic Self) in Yoga Sutras. Unti=
l we overcome our vasanas, we are bound. Some are dense and some are very s=
ubtle. But all of them bind us.

Comment 6:1.=
 As per Shri Vimalananda, you may also offer all the karmas as Homa to inne=
r 
devas or ishta devta? He mentioned that there is lesser of suffering if =

you do that. Who gets the remaining delta suffering?
=C2=A0
My Response: K=
armaphala for a specific karma is not a function of that karma alone. It is=
 a function of that karma and one's current state of mind. If someone serve=
s spoiled food, one may get an upset stomach for half day or diaria for a w=
eek. It depends on how strong one is. Similarly, the same karmaphala set in=
 motion by the same external agents of delivery (physical & subtle) can cau=
se different reaction inside one, depending on one's current state of mind.=

=C2=A0
An idle mind is devil's workshop. Our minds keep vibrating with var=
ious notions and thoughts. A mind vibrating with selfish desires and unnece=
ssary clutter/confusion *amplifies* the negative effects of one's environme=
nt (through which fruits of karmas are administered).
=C2=A0
If one thinks =
of ishta devata with reverence and contemplates various ideals and qualitie=
s of ishta devata and mind vibrates with saattwik energy, it absorbs the ne=
gative effects of one's environment better or atleast does not amplify them=
.

>=C2=A0The cosmos runs based on the fundament=
al law that each action (karma) gives a reaction/result (karmaphala) commen=
surate with it. Shakti is the sum total of all the beings with various agen=
das engaging in various karmas and experiencing various karmaphalas. Purush=
a is the witness of it all.
>=C2=A0

on part of Cosmic Cumulative Kinetic Consciousness (i.e. Shakti). There are=
 very complicated rules that decide the *sequencing* of karmaphalas and pic=
king of agents for their delivery.

>=C2=A0
>At any time, some karmas from=
 one's past are placed in a "must experience karmaphala in this life" pool,=
 some karmas in a "preferably experience karmaphala in this life" pool and =
the rest in the third pool which may not be experienced anytime soon. The w=
ay karmas are assigned and ordered in these pools is based on the balancing=
 of karma/karmaphala sequencing of all beings.
>=C2=A0
>The assignment and =
ordering of these pools will constantly undergo churn as one engages in var=
ious new actions and adds them to the pools. Also, as new people enter one'=

r re-arrange one's dynamics with other beings (including planets, deities e=
tc, who are the subtle agents of delivery of karmaphala, who operate throug=
h other people who act as physical agents of delivery!). The karma pools ma=
y be re-arranged as a result. Some undesirable karmas may be downgraded to =
a lower pool or pushed down in order within the same pool. Or, some desirab=
le karmas may be upgraded to a higher pool or pushed up in order within the=
 same pool.
>=C2=A0When someone curses or blesses one, with sufficient ment=
al force behind it (this is the key), the same thing can happen. It is all =
about re-arranging karmas between the karmik pools. Every action by one, or=
 even people around one, has the potential to re-arrange one's karmik pools=
. A karma about to give karmaphala may be postponed or a karma that was not=
 to give karmaphala anytime soon may be advanced sooner.
>=C2=A0
>However, =
remember that the remedial measure has to be as intense as the karma that i=
t is trying to manipulate. You can move a small rock with small force, but =
you need a large force to move a big rock or a hill.

even evil people have a lot of positive karmas in their optional pool, and =

actions and fruits. All beings are equal in Her eyes, from the lowest of ev=

very of fruits to actions using available agents.

>The karmas we co=

</span>. The verb "prArabh" means "to begin". Its noun form "prArambha" mea=

as already begun and in the pipeline. Whereas sanchita karmas are piled up =
karmas that have not kicked off their fruits yet. They can be delayed indef=
initely. If one becomes liberated while living, one can merge in Cosmic Sel=

arabdha karmas are already in the pipeline and need to be experienced even =
by a liberated being.<br> <br>Though fruits of prarabdha karmas are al=

 All one needs to do is to stop engaging in problematic karmas to add to th=

 calm and sustainable state of mind in which that can be maintained even in=
 the middle of a tumultous hurricane caused in one's life due to serious ba=
d karmas from the past. Once serious troubles set in or mind focuses on sen=
se objects, material world and one's pleasures and pains, mind tends to los=
e its balance and judgment, starts pursuing its limited selfish agendas and=
 starts performing even more bad karmas. Thus, praying to God and contempla=

 the mind in
 which it can maintain some calmness, balance and judgment. If=

Dear Narasimha Ji,<br>
  =
      I was pondering over few things we routinely come acro=
ss as a part of worship and how it manipulates karma pipe line,<br>
(1) Whe=
n someone gives a `curse' or does a prayoga such as `maran' or `uchhatan' w=
hat happens to a person who is at receiving end, does his bad karma comes f=
orward or is it a new parabdha that is created. I vaguely remember Vimalana=
nda mentioning something about a Saint's curse in Aghora trilogy.<br>


(2)=
 On similar note, what happens when you get `blessings' say from a saint or=
 elders? We also come across lot of tantric items like Rudraksha, Parad Shi=
valinga or say Shwetarka Ganapati =E2=80=93 what do this items really do if=
 they work? Something similar with wearing gemstones for planets =E2=80=93 =
do they bring forward good karmas or they create new ones?<br>


(3) I reco=
llect an episode from famous "Gurucharitra" (well known in Maharashtra), wh=
erein a just widowed lady cried out to Shri Guru "If we cannot change `para=
bdha, then, why do we worship God at all". At that point Shri Guru rejuvena=
tes her dead husband, but later tells his shisya, that he has only readjust=
ed the karma from next birth. [Please excuse me if this is not exact word t=
o word, as I am trying to recollect this episode from old memory]. So quest=
ion I have is, does our sadhana change karmaphal to a great extent or it is=
 just our perception that changes?<br>
