Dear Rajarshi,
=A0
You (@TheRajarshi) asked me (@homam108) on Twitter: "Wha=
t is the exact meaning of the term Kutastha?"
=A0
I have an answer longer t=
han Twitter allows.
=A0
In Sanskrita, words have several meanings and subtl=
e concepts are cleverly expressed with layers of meanings.
=A0
Stha means "=
firmly placed/established in".

=A0
Kuta means a group/collection (e.g. ash=
ta graha kuta). It also means a dwelling/house. It also means an illusion. =
It also means the horn of an animal. It also means the highest point/pinnac=
le/summit.
=A0
We beings are made up of a collection of entities such as se=
nses, manas, chitta, buddhi etc. Kutastha is the intelligence that brings t=
hem all together and stays in the group as what binds them as one thing (i.=
e. that which is present in the collection).
=A0
Every perishable structure=
 (including any being or any world) in this cosmos is like a temporary dwel=
ling. Kutastha is the dweller of that dwelling (that which is well-establis=
hed in the dwelling).
=A0
Every being in this cosmos is like an illusion, i=
n the sense that the reality of its existence depends on the frame of refer=
ence. Kutastha is its unborn and perennial essence that exists within, irre=
spective of the frame of reference (that which truly exists within the illu=
sion).
=A0
Kutastha is also the Absolute Essence firmly placed in the sahas=
rara chakra (that which is firmly placed in the horn).
=A0
In the end, when=
 a being reaches the pinnacle of its awareness, the awareness will point to=
 Self. Kutastha is Self that is rooted in the highest awareness (that which=
 is rooted in the pinnacle).
=A0
All these are "exact meanings" at various =
levels of understanding/awareness.

=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha
