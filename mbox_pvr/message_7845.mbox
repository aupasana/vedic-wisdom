Namaste,

As twitter is too restrictive a medium, I want to answer a question that 
came up in an exchange between my guru Manish and me on Twitter, here. 
Some portions of the Twitter exchange are quoted at the end, in 
chronological order, in case someone is interested in the background.

I will answer the following question posed by Manish based on my 
understanding:

<<<The question to my mind is this: was Ramakrishna a Jeevanmukta? If 
so, Why did he suffer with throat cancer if he was not identifying with 
his actions? (according to your interpretation of Vasistha's 
definition??)>>>

*        *        *

Let me elaborate on my understanding of jeevanmukti. Manish loosely (in 
my view) said in this exchange that rinas are of body and a jeevanmukta 
continues to fulfil those rinas.

But body is an insentient object. It has no rinas. The rinas are not of 
the body, but of the mind that identifies with it. It is the 
antahkaranas of mind - ahamkara (I-ness) and chitta 
(memory/conditioning) - that are the source of various rinas, 
particularly chitta. As mind identifies with a body, it projects its 
rinas on the body and makes the body "experience" and "do" things, in 
accordance with those rinas/conditioning.

If the conditioning in chitta is completely wiped out and ahamkara 
merges in Self, then it is mukti. But, if the conditioning in chitta is 
completely wiped out and yet ahamkara continues to exist with no 
limiting notions (it is basically the conditioning in chitta that is 
limiting), then one becomes jeevanmukta (liberated while living).

Unlike in the case of one who leaves body and gets mukti, a jeevanmukta 
continues to have an I-ness (but which is not limited by any notions or 
conditioning). This unconditioned I-ness does project into a body. But 
it does not say "I am this body and hence this body should be kept 
healthy or strong" (THAT would be conditioning in chitta, which is wiped 
out now!). On the other hand, it does not either say "this body should 
be ignored and destroyed". Though conditioning is absent now, body keeps 
experiencing and doing things based on the *momentum* set in motion 
before one became jeevanmukta and engaged in conditioned experiences and 
actions. This is like a fan turning for a while after the electricity 
has been stopped.

Manas, buddhi and indriyas keep working as they did before. If one has 
throat cancer, indriyas may sense pain. Manas (sensory/motor mind) may 
process that input and register pain. Buddhi may analyze various 
observations and draw various conclusions (e.g. "when I gulp or try to 
swallow food, it hurts even more", "when I take so and so herbal liquid, 
it feels better" etc). A normal person whose conditioned mind (chitta) 
says "I should overcome and not have this pain" may think of various 
things to do and struggle with them. But an unconditioned being has no 
such considerations. Though one may feel and express the pain and other 
objective experiences, one reacts to it differently.

*        *        *

This is a key point:

Manas and buddhi are good at making objective observations and rational 
deductions, but, by themselves, they do not have ANY agenda. They 
neither like something nor dislike something. THAT comes from the 
conditioning in chitta! The hallmark of a jeevanmukta is that THAT is 
absent!

*        *        *

Whether Ramakrishna was a jeevanmukta is a moot question. A better way 
to express your question is: Can a jeevanmukta get throat cancer and 
feel pain? How is it possible if there are no karmas or rinas left?

I have already answered it. But, let me sum it up briefly again. Body, 
various body parts, jnanendriyas, karmendiyas, manas and buddhi of a 
jeevanmukta continue to operate as before. One's I-ness is intact and 
does project itself onto those. But neither I-ness nor those things 
carry any rinas or karmas. Chitta - the repository of conditioning and 
rinas - is clean. There are no limiting notions. One's body, indriyas, 
manas & buddhi keep experiencing and doing things (good or bad!) based 
on the previous momentum set by the play of rnas and karmas while some 
conditioning was left in chitta.

Body, various body parts, indriyas of jnana and karma and manas are all 
portions borrowed from various deities. Ahamkara (I-ness) infuses 
sentience into them by projecting awareness into them. The conditioning 
in chitta is what drives how all these are viewed and used. Instead of 
looking at a sense organ as a portion of Indra or Mitra, one views it as 
"my so and so sense organ", due to conditioning in chitta. That is what 
creates karmas and rinas. When that conditioning is *completely* 
overcome, ahamkara can still project awareness into those objects, but 
it sees them for what they are. It does not have false and limiting 
notions like "this throat is mine and MUST feel nice and not feel 
painful".

*        *        *

Most people who may claim to be (or think they are) jeevanmuktas are not 
really jeevanmuktas in today's world.

If one wants to understand the state of jeevanmukti, Yoga Vaasishtham is 
the best book. The entire discourse by Maharshi Vasishtha to Lord Rama 
is a detailed and elaborate definition and characterization of a 
jeevanmukta.

There may be other books that explain better how to do various sadhanas 
to progress spiritually and get closer to being liberated oneday. But, 
when it comes elaborating what liberation while living actually is, 
there is none better than Yoga Vaasishtham. Of course, one can say that 
this is merely an intellectual exercise as far as *we* are concerned. It 
perhaps is, as none of may ever become a jeevanmukta..

One word of caution: I write with a very confident tone when I have 
strong conviction in what I write. That is how I am. But I can 
definitely be wrong. So please feel free to ignore me! :-)

Happy Shivaratri (tomorrow night) to all!

Best regards,
Narasimha

Twitter exchange on jeevanmukta between Manish (twitter handle 
@mmpandit) and Narasimha (twitter handle @homam108):

Manish: So, what is a jeevanmukta doing here? Nothing really, fulfilling 
all rnas, wait for rnas to be over.
Narasimha: If a "jeevanmukta" fails in "fulfilling all rnas", will he b 
bound again? If no, y r they called rnas? If yes, y call him mukta?
Manish: No, rnas will work out themselves, slowly or fast as may be the 
case. The rnas are of the body he or she occupies. He is mukta because 
he experiences, actually sees the rnas to be the body's only. Rnas apply 
to the body, not to you. You are that "speck of effulgent light", call 
it what you want, Atma, etc.
Narasimha: Well, that speck of effulgent light was never bound. So, who 
exactly bcame "mukta"? Did & does he/it have rnas? If these "rnas of 
body" r somehow not fulfilled after one bcomes jeevanmukta, what happens 
to one? :-)
Manish: You are right. The mind thought, that, it was the body, instead 
of this light. That is the original problem. Which every being is born 
with. Rnas arise from this identification which creates karma. U r not 
that, so u r not bound, when the mind realises this. Became "Mukta" is 
also not quite true, since u r that "Light" frm d beginning
Narasimha: Then, r the rnas of the "body" as u said r of the mind? When 
a mind identifies with light & bcomes mukta, does it hv rnas left?
Manish: Ok, karmas projected into mind, are acted on and may be 
experienced by body. So, why is a jeevanmukta subject to this? because, 
that person although aware of the light at all times, and of the causal 
n subtle bodies, has not yet directed d mind to identify as that light 
at all times, key word being "all". This gives karmas time to work. Next 
stage is 24/7 id with light
Narasimha: As per my understanding, the person u r defining is not a 
jeevanmukta. He may b an elevated being, but not mukta (liberated) yet.
Manish: I derive that definition of this "state" from somebody, no 
problem in disagreement. 24/7 identification with light, most likely 
body should not exist, no?
Narasimha: Id with light forever with body dropping off is just mukti, 
not jivanmukti! Jivanmukti is where body stays. Is body really different 
from light? In fact, is there anything other than light? Jivanmukti is 
seeing the play of objects but seeing all as light. Mukti & rna are 
contradictory concepts & cant coexist. U rnt "free" till u pay back what 
u owe. And that means u dont owe anybody anything once u r truly free. 
Words like free, liberated & jivanmukta r often misused.
Manish: Will explain a bit in detail sometime.
Narasimha: OK. :-) But, as far as "explaining" is concerned, Vasishtha 
explained as clearly & elaborately as any human being can ever hope 2.
Manish: The question to my mind is this: was Ramakrishna a Jeevanmukta? 
If so, Why did he suffer with throat cancer if he was not identifying 
with his actions? (according to your interpretation of Vasistha's 
definition??)
Narasimha: Vasishtha didnt give a single definition. His entire 
discourse 2 Rama is a definition of jeevanmukta! Will answer ur RK qn 
later.
