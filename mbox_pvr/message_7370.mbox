Namaste,

World is not ending anytime soon. We are about 5,000 years into Kali 
yuga and another 427,000 years are left before this cycle ends and 
another cycle starts.

As per Krishna's teachings in SrimadBhagavatam, about 5,000 years at the 
beginning of Kali yuga will see dharma decay badly on earth. Next 5,000 
years will see increasing dharma on earth. After that, dharma will decay 
unchecked. We are at the cusp of decay in dharma stopping and increase 
in dharma starting.

In the next 5-20 years, there will be big changes on earth. Natural 
disasters like earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, volcano erruptions 
will occur more frequently than usual, hit areas dwelt by masses more 
frequently than usual and happen in such a way as to cause major blows 
to our modern capitalistic civilization. Capitalism as we know it will 
give way to a more dharmik way of living. Consumption bubble (which is 
the root cause of all other bubbles we saw - stock market bubble, real 
estate bubble etc) will burst and blatant consumerism will go away. It 
will be replaced by respect for nature and a more natural and dharmik 
way of living.

Though end of 2012 IS interesting astrologically and the second half of 
2012 will bring some major changes, 2015 and 2016 are more interesting 
and will bring some big changes.

We are in the middle (near the beginning) of epic geo-political and 
civilizational changes on earth that happen once every few millennia. 
Though all big changes involves chaos and some destruction of life and 
material things, this change will result in a better and more 
sustainable civilization on earth. This will be good for the future of 
earth.

Individually, to cope with the changes better in the coming decade, 
increase your spiritual practices and develop a calm, stable, focused 
and detached mind that can engage in powerful and passionate actions and 
yet be unaffected by the end result of those actions. Whatever we get, 
whatever happens around us, belongs to god and we are temporary visitors 
here and caretakers. Enjoy what comes your way, but don't think it is 
yours. It is god's. Fully imbibing this attitude requires a lot of 
practice (spiritual sadhana).

Best regards,
Narasimha
