Namaste Rajarshi,
 
Parasara equates Rama incarnation to Sun and Krishna in=
carnation to Moon. However, do not apply the Pingala-Ida (right-left) divis=
ion in this case. When you have a two-fold division, then the solar/lunar o=
r right/left or Pingala/Ida or devatas/pitris division comes into play.
 
I=
n the case of Vishnu's incarnation, there aren't just two. We have nine inc=
arnations. So we are talking about a nine-fold division in this mapping. So=
 we have all the nine planets in play. This has nothing to do with left or =
right channels.
 
*        *        *
 
Within each person, Sun represents =
the soul, Moon represents the mind, Mars represents the energy and initiati=
ve, Mercury represents the learning ability, Jupiter represents the intelle=
ct, wisdom and judgment, Venus represents the spirit of enjoyment and bliss=
, Saturn represents the spirit of hard work or discipline.
 
Vishnu represe=
nts pure sattwa. Rama is Vishnu's incarnation with Sun's nature. Krishna is=
 Vishnu's incarnation with Moon's nature. Sun being the soul, Rama is from =
the soul principle of the cosmic being. Moon being the mind, Krishna is fro=
m the mind principle of the cosmic being.
 
*        *        *
 
Dear Utpa=
l,
 
> I didn't understand above. Lord Rama was a Vishnu Avataar and procla=
imed by our scriptures as a 'Purnaavataar'.
> 
> how come then you state di=
fference between their level of evolution?
 
An arrow, a simple chain and a=
 necklace with an elaborate work may all be made from the same 22 caret gol=
d. You may call an object made with 22 caret gold to be purer than an objec=
t made with 14 caret gold. But if the arrow, chain and beautiful necklace a=
re all made of 22 caret gold, they are all equally pure. Simply because the=
 necklace required more work, it is nore purer.
 
Similarly, Rama and Krish=
na were both from Vishnu - pure sattwa. One is not more "evolved" than the =
other. They just served different purposes (like the arrow and necklace mad=
e of the same 22 pure gold) and hence had different qualities.
 
Like I sai=
d, earlier, Rama and Krishna are from the soul and mind principles of the c=
osmic being. Soul is not bothered about the duality and maya, but mind is. =
Rama was not a miracle worker. Krishna was the master of miracles and had c=
omplete control over duality.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

        Dear Narasmihaji

        Thank you for the reference to the Yoga V=
ashistam. Plus the Vishnu Puran also mentiones Lord Rama as an avatar. 

  =
      Though I could not convince the person I was discussing with, one  th=
ing sturck me as interesting.

        Lord Rama is the Surya Vamshi. Surya=
 related to the right channel, the path of logic and discrimination and str=
ucture. This you had explanied in your mail on Dakshina Kali.

        Wher=
e as Lord Krishna was a Chandra Vamshi, of the lunar channel of intution/em=
otion etc. 
        As a corollary, can the path shown by Lord Rama be equa=
ted to the path of Dakshina Kali and that of Krishna as Vama Kali.

       =
 -Regards
         Rajarshi

          Namaste,

          In the episodes before Rama's birth, Valmik=
i clearly portrays him as an 
          avatara of Vishnu.

          In "Y=
oga Vaasishtham" , also written by Valmiki, Rama becomes depressed. 
      =
    Vasishtha, in the presence of Vishwamitra and other rishis and gods, te=
aches 
          self-knowledge to Rama. Vasishtha reveals the true nature =
of Rama then and 
          Rama remains in samadhi. Vasishtha has to final=
ly enter the Sushumna nadi of 
          Rama to disturb his samadhi and br=
ing him back to senses. After that, Rama 
          knows who he is.

     =
     Rama and Krishna were both avataras of Vishnu. Krishna knew it from th=
e 
          beginning. In the case of Rama, sages like Vasishtha, Vishwami=
tra knew it 
          even before Rama's birth, but Rama himself did not k=
now it in the beginning. 
          But he too knew it later.

          Ho=
wever, Krishna had complete mastery over the duality, while Rama did not. 
=
          Rama had to wade the dual world like normal people. Krishna could=
 do any 
          manipulation of the dual world that he wanted.

        =

          Narasimha

BR>> In a discussion with another very learned 
          individual, I =
was told this <BR>> following 
          statement:<BR>><BR>> "Val=
miki had projected Ram as a person who 
          tried his level best to l=
ive by <BR>> principles. He was still not 
          God. Or, at least, =
he never realised he was <BR>> an avatar (one 
          who undergoes a=
n 'avataran' (coming down to earth to serve <BR>> a 
          specific =
purpose of the society of his time).<BR>><BR>> It was 
          latt=
er day writers like Tulsidas who conferred godhood on 
          Ram."<BR>&=
gt;<BR>> Is this true? Is there any verse in the original 
          Val=
miki Ramayana which <BR>> shows divinity (avatarahood) on 
          Ram=
a?<BR>><BR>> -Regards<BR>>
