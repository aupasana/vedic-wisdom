Dear Sir,
In=C2=A0my journey of 60 years, somebody guided me like this with=
 authority. I am really very much grateful to you sir. You have rightly sai=
d, lot of misunderstanding is there about Chandi Path. 
It is also stated i=
n Chandi Path that it should be chanted loudly to get more benefits. Is it =
true? I am always reading within my mind without any lips movement.

Namaste,
=C2=A0
1. T=
he instruction was to spread homam and create a community of sadhakas acros=
s the world who worship various deities in fire. It can be any deities.
=C2=
=A0
2. The beauty of Chandi Path is that it instills a great sense of disci=
pline in one. Even 13 chapters take a long time, without anyting before or =
after.
=C2=A0
Kavacha, argala, keelaka, raatri sooktam, nyasas and moola ma=
ntra are recommended before, while nyasas, moola mantra and devi sooktam ar=
e recommended after.
=C2=A0
However, in my humble opinion, nothing is reall=
y compulsory. Doing just the 13 chapters everyday can be very powerful afte=
r a while. I see nothing wrong in it.
=C2=A0
3. Both are correct and work d=
ifferently. However, those who try who pronounce the beeja mantras as "aing=
 hreeng" invariably misponounce them. The "g" becomes explicit. Ideally, yo=
u should start pronouncing as though you are going to say "aing" and abrupt=
ly stop just when you are about to say "g", without saying it. It is not ea=
sy to pronounce this correctly.
=C2=A0
Instead of trying "aing hreeng" and =
messing it up, it is better to just say "aim hreem".
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =
*
=C2=A0
Internal purity and lack (or minimization) of individualized ego i=
s the key in any sadhana. Thousands of hours of sadhana without them is fru=
itless. One who is pure and has a very limited ego achieves results quickly=
.
=C2=A0
There is a lot of misinformation and unfounded fears that are spre=
ad regarding Chandi path. Do not worry about them.
=C2=A0
Eating an elabora=
te set of appetizers and desserts before and after a meal may be recommende=
d. But one can get indigestion from it too. If the meal itself is correct f=
or you, go ahead and enjoy it without appetizers or dessert! Whatever you e=
at, eat it happily and positively to get the most energy from it. Similarly=
, read whatever you read with a sense of surrender and limited ego.
=C2=A0
=
Instead of doing everything with a lower focus, it is better to just do 13 =
chapters with a higher focus.
=C2=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

 Maha Ganapati Homam/Chandi Homam






Dear Narsimhaji
1.Since=C2=A0I have=
 joined this group before some couple of months, some previous mails I have=
 not read. You have mentioned somewhere that Manishji was inspired from Mot=
her to start Homam daily. I would like to know whether it was for Maha Gana=
pati Homam too or only Chandi Homam?,
2.Please also guide me whether really=
 we should read Chandi Path or Sapta Sati Stotra with Devi Kavacha, Argala,=
 Kilak and Ratri Suktam=C2=A0before 13 Adhyayas and Devi Sukta, etc in the =
end ? Suppose we recite only 13 Adhyayas only after Sankalpam-will it not b=
e sufficient in daily routine worship? Or it is compulsory?
3. Can you guid=
e me the proper uttering of Beej Mantras in Navarna Mantra? some say it is =
Aing, Hring, Kling.... and some say it is Aim, Hrim, Klim......
Thanks with=
 respect.

Namaste friends,

Excellent =
and inspirational writeup Narayan!

* * *

Earlier, I mentioned the Mother'=
s instruction to Manish when She appeared in front of him at the temple in =
Chennai during Shata Chandi homam, to spread the practice of regular homam =
around the world. However, Manish did not reveal that incident to me until =
much later. All he told me at that time was that Narayan really needed to d=
o homam everyday and that I should teach a simple procedure to him.

I expe=
rimented with homam, started doing occasionally and liked it. I started doi=
ng a quick procedure everyday. After doing it daily for a few months, I fin=
ally got down to the original task - teaching Narayan. I chose to write a d=
etailed manual for that purpose. In hindsight, I made the correct choice, a=
s many people in addition to Narayan are able to do homam using the manual =
now! I and many other people have benefited (and will benefit). However, as=
 far as my mind concerned, all this started for Narayan! When it was time f=
or Narayan to start doing homam, many people across the world started with =
him. What a fortunate soul..

* * *

It was probably for a reason that Mani=
sh did not tell me at the onset itself what the Mother asked him to do. My =
attitude and mental state would've been different while working on the manu=
al. I would've been more egoistic and also hurried more. Because the only t=
hing I was told was to teach Narayan, I took my sweet time, arrived at the =
correct balance and also wrote it down without many pretensions. The whole =
effort ended up being more saattwik and I really benefited from the exercis=
e. If I had known the full story, it would have had more rajas given my men=
tal state then and I would not have had made the same progress I made, whil=
e preparing myself to teach homam to Narayan.

Manish told me the full stor=
y only when I was better prepared to handle the information and, of course,=
 I added it to the preface of the manual as asked by him then.

* * *

A go=
od guru protects a sishya from unnecessary information that can wreak havoc=
 with the ego. I remember another incident.

One day in the spring of the s=
ame year, I decided to spend a whole day meditating with Gayatri mantra dur=
ing the coming weekend. The inspiration came out of nowhere and I immediate=
ly latched on to it. When I told Manish, he only said "good, go ahead and d=
o it". I started before sunrise and went on till 9:30 pm. Except for 3-4 br=
eaks of 2 min, a 20 min break at noon for bath and a small lunch and anothe=
r 10 min break for another bath at dusk, I was basically sitting in the sam=
e place and meditating with Gayatri mantra. It was a very good experience. =
I was in a very nice state at the end of the day.

I noticed on the next da=
y that the previous day was Akshaya Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya). It =
is considered a very auspicious day and it is believed that spiritual sadha=
na on that day is 1000 times more powerful than on other days. Though I had=
 not noticed it before, I picked a perfect day for the sadhana. I was excit=
ed. When I mentioned this to Manish with excitement a few days later, he sa=
id calmly "I knew it earlier itself. But I did not tell you because knowing=
 it would've distracted you. You would have been excited at doing the sadha=
na on Akshaya Triteeya and that excitement would've changed the mental focu=
s and brought more rajas into the sadhana."

He was absolutely right. As su=
ch, I was "proud" of doing such a sadhana. The ego and pride brought rajas =
and limited the mental focus on the mantra. If I was aware that I was doing=
 this sadhana on a powerful day, it would've increased the pride and excite=
ment, brought in rajas and reduced the saattwik focus on mantra further. Eg=
o is a very dangerous entity. Even after one makes excellent progress, it c=
an suddenly return and pull one down! After hearing Manish's words, I intro=
spected and found that my ego was still alive and kicking and that he was w=
ise not to feed it with more delicious food!

Lucky are those who have a gu=
ru who can succintly tell them what is useful rather than what sounds good.=
 Lucky are those who have a guru (or someone else) who can go to the heart =
of their problem and point it out, so that they can weed it out through fur=
ther introspection and weaken it through conscious effort.

* * *

I rememb=
er one more similar incident. Before the shata chandi homam in early 2006, =
a priest we respect a lot took me to a Siddha (a perfected/advanced soul). =
When he looked at me, he mentioned the name of one of the saptarshis and sa=
id that I very close to him and that I would do some important work in this=
 birth.

When I saw Manish later that day, I mentioned this to him. He imme=
diately became serious and said "Narasimha, do you need one more identity? =
Your ego is already strong with the identity of 'Narasimha, the Sanskrit sc=
holar', 'Narasimha, the astrologer', 'Narasimha, the engineer', 'Narasimha,=
 the spiritual seeker' etc. It will take great effort to overcome those ide=
ntities and find True Self. As if that challenge is not sufficient, do you =
really need yet another new identity to feed your ego further? See, what he=
 said may very well be correct. But it is not useful for your progress. You=
 have to rise above all identities."

How true and wise!

* * *

Just as a =
fat and mighty dog may win over a lean and weak dog and get all the food gi=
ven by the master, ahamkara (ego or the sense of "I") within us wins over t=
he spirit of detachment and gets all the energy possible. Just as a good ma=
ster may chain the fat dog and feed the lean dog specially, we too must con=
sciously try to restrain ego and increase detachment.

Manish has a unique =
way of looking at things and some simple points he made brought so much cla=
rity to my thinking and sped up my spiritual evolution in this life. Even w=
ithout giving any specific mantra to me, like many spiritual gurus do, he l=
it the lamp of knowledge in my heart. He would say the lamp and light were =
already there and he simply wiped the dust on the lamp that was blocking th=
e light. That is what a good guru does. He/She wipes off the thick layer of=
 dirt (conditioning by gunas) on the glass (ego) that encloses the lamp (Se=
lf) that is lit in the heart. Sometimes, we may be too caught up to notice =
that dirt ourselves..

* * *

Homam and other spiritual sadhana tools are v=
ery helpful. But one should also try to introspect and change one's thinkin=
g, on an ongoing basis. There is no magic pill. For most people, this does =
not take just a single moment or day or month or year. It CAN take a long t=
ime. As Narayan indicated, one should start walking on the path and not wor=
ry about the progress and the distance left. One who keeps walking without =
distractions will reach the goal.

The point I want to emphasize is that th=
e external rituals (like homam) and the internal introspection (to change a=
ttitude) should go hand in hand. After a while, there will be synergy betwe=
en them and they will start to work together very effectively.

Best regard=
s,
Narasimha

<DIV>2.Please also guide me whether <U>really</=
U> we should read Chandi Path or Sapta Sati Stotra <STRONG>with Devi Kavach=
a, Argala, Kilak and Ratri Suktam</STRONG> before 13 Adhyayas <STRONG>=
and Devi Sukta, etc in the end </STRONG>? Suppose we recite only 13 Adhyaya=
s only after Sankalpam-will it not be sufficient in daily routine worship? =
Or it is compulsory?</DIV>
<DIV>3. Can you guide me the proper uttering of =
Beej Mantras in Navarna Mantra? some say it is Aing, Hring, Kling.... and s=
ome say it is Aim, Hrim, Klim......</DIV>

<DIV>Namaste friends,<=
BR><BR>Excellent and inspirational writeup Narayan!<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Ear=
lier, I mentioned the Mother's instruction to Manish when She appeared in f=
ront of him at the temple in Chennai during Shata Chandi homam, to spread t=
he practice of regular homam around the world. However, Manish did not reve=
al that incident to me until much later. All he told me at that time was th=
at Narayan really needed to do homam everyday and that I should teach a sim=
ple procedure to him.<BR><BR>I experimented with homam, started doing occas=
ionally and liked it. I started doing a quick procedure everyday. After doi=
ng it daily for a few months, I finally got down to the original task - tea=
ching Narayan. I chose to write a detailed manual for that purpose. In hind=
sight, I made the correct choice, as many people in addition to Narayan are=
 able to do homam using the manual now! I and many other people have benefi=
ted (and will benefit). However, as far as my
 mind concerned, all this sta=
rted for Narayan! When it was time for Narayan to start doing homam, many p=
eople across the world started with him. What a fortunate soul..<BR><BR>* *=
 *<BR><BR>It was probably for a reason that Manish did not tell me at the o=
nset itself what the Mother asked him to do. My attitude and mental state w=
ould've been different while working on the manual. I would've been more eg=
oistic and also hurried more. Because the only thing I was told was to teac=
h Narayan, I took my sweet time, arrived at the correct balance and also wr=
ote it down without many pretensions. The whole effort ended up being more =
saattwik and I really benefited from the exercise. If I had known the full =
story, it would have had more rajas given my mental state then and I would =
not have had made the same progress I made, while preparing myself to teach=
 homam to Narayan.<BR><BR>Manish told me the full story only when I was bet=
ter prepared to handle the information
 and, of course, I added it to the p=
reface of the manual as asked by him then.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>A good guru =
protects a sishya from unnecessary information that can wreak havoc with th=
e ego. I remember another incident.<BR><BR>One day in the spring of the sam=
e year, I decided to spend a whole day meditating with Gayatri mantra durin=
g the coming weekend. The inspiration came out of nowhere and I immediately=
 latched on to it. When I told Manish, he only said "good, go ahead and do =
it". I started before sunrise and went on till 9:30 pm. Except for 3-4 brea=
ks of 2 min, a 20 min break at noon for bath and a small lunch and another =
10 min break for another bath at dusk, I was basically sitting in the same =
place and meditating with Gayatri mantra. It was a very good experience. I =
was in a very nice state at the end of the day.<BR><BR>I noticed on the nex=
t day that the previous day was Akshaya Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya).=
 It is considered a very
 auspicious day and it is believed that spiritual =
sadhana on that day is 1000 times more powerful than on other days. Though =
I had not noticed it before, I picked a perfect day for the sadhana. I was =
excited. When I mentioned this to Manish with excitement a few days later, =
he said calmly "I knew it earlier itself. But I did not tell you because kn=
owing it would've distracted you. You would have been excited at doing the =
sadhana on Akshaya Triteeya and that excitement would've changed the mental=
 focus and brought more rajas into the sadhana."<BR><BR>He was absolutely r=
ight. As such, I was "proud" of doing such a sadhana. The ego and pride bro=
ught rajas and limited the mental focus on the mantra. If I was aware that =
I was doing this sadhana on a powerful day, it would've increased the pride=
 and excitement, brought in rajas and reduced the saattwik focus on mantra =
further. Ego is a very dangerous entity. Even after one makes excellent pro=
gress, it can
 suddenly return and pull one down! After hearing Manish's wo=
rds, I introspected and found that my ego was still alive and kicking and t=
hat he was wise not to feed it with more delicious food!<BR><BR>Lucky are t=
hose who have a guru who can succintly tell them what is useful rather than=
 what sounds good. Lucky are those who have a guru (or someone else) who ca=
n go to the heart of their problem and point it out, so that they can weed =
it out through further introspection and weaken it through conscious effort=
.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>I remember one more similar incident. Before the shat=
a chandi homam in early 2006, a priest we respect a lot took me to a Siddha=
 (a perfected/advanced soul). When he looked at me, he mentioned the name o=
f one of the saptarshis and said that I very close to him and that I would =
do some important work in this birth.<BR><BR>When I saw Manish later that d=
ay, I mentioned this to him. He immediately became serious and said "Narasi=
mha, do
 you need one more identity? Your ego is already strong with the id=
entity of 'Narasimha, the Sanskrit scholar', 'Narasimha, the astrologer', '=
Narasimha, the engineer', 'Narasimha, the spiritual seeker' etc. It will ta=
ke great effort to overcome those identities and find True Self. As if that=
 challenge is not sufficient, do you really need yet another new identity t=
o feed your ego further? See, what he said may very well be correct. But it=
 is not useful for your progress. You have to rise above all identities."<B=
R><BR>How true and wise!<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Just as a fat and mighty dog m=
ay win over a lean and weak dog and get all the food given by the master, a=
hamkara (ego or the sense of "I") within us wins over the spirit of detachm=
ent and gets all the energy possible. Just as a good master may chain the f=
at dog and feed the lean dog specially, we too must consciously try to rest=
rain ego and increase detachment.<BR><BR>Manish has a unique way of looking=

 at things and some simple points he made brought so much clarity to my th=
inking and sped up my spiritual evolution in this life. Even without giving=
 any specific mantra to me, like many spiritual gurus do, he lit the lamp o=
f knowledge in my heart. He would say the lamp and light were already there=
 and he simply wiped the dust on the lamp that was blocking the light. That=
 is what a good guru does. He/She wipes off the thick layer of dirt (condit=
ioning by gunas) on the glass (ego) that encloses the lamp (Self) that is l=
it in the heart. Sometimes, we may be too caught up to notice that dirt our=
selves..<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Homam and other spiritual sadhana tools are ve=
ry helpful. But one should also try to introspect and change one's thinking=
, on an ongoing basis. There is no magic pill. For most people, this does n=
ot take just a single moment or day or month or year. It CAN take a long ti=
me. As Narayan indicated, one should start walking on the path and
 not wor=
ry about the progress and the distance left. One who keeps walking without =
distractions will reach the goal.<BR><BR>The point I want to emphasize is t=
hat the external rituals (like homam) and the internal introspection (to ch=
ange attitude) should go hand in hand. After a while, there will be synergy=
 between them and they will start to work together very effectively.<BR><BR=

 Mahaganapthi homam, I thought he was really joking!<BR>> When I got bac=
