Namaste,
 
The 5 vaayus (winds) called praana, apaanaa, vyaana, udaana and =
samaana are not parts of gross physical body. They are parts of the sookshm=
a sareera (subtle body). Each vaayu is one kind of kinetic energy causing o=
ne kind of movement in awareness. Of course, each movement of subtle awaren=
ess is linked to movement of something in the gross physical body, i.e. the=
y happen together.
 
Praana vaayu is not merely oxygen. Praana vaayu is the=
 lifeforce that moves within the body and keeps each atom of the body alive=
.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
