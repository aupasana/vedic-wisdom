Namaste,
 
It is originally "om bhuuH bhuvaH svaH". After sandhi (joining), it becomes "om bhuurbhuvassvaH". The "r" after "bhuu" and "s" after "bhuva" are the sounds that visarga transforms into, based on the sounds coming next (bh and s respectively). Those sounds are to be vocalized.
 
Pronouncing "bhuuH" as "bhuuhu", "bhuvaH" as "bhuvaha" and "svaH" as "svaha" is wrong. Either pronounce it without sandhi as "om bhuuH bhuvaH svaH" or do sandhi and pronounce it as "om bhuurbhuvassvaH". The latter is preferred.
 
BTW, the word "svaH" above is also written by some as "suvaH". Both are correct.
 
*        *        *
 
If you pronounce visarga (H) correctly, then you will actually find that first saying "bhuuH" and then "bhuvaH" without ANY break in between will automatically make it sound like "bhuurbhuvaH".
 
The grammar rules of Sanskrit (e.g. visarga becoming "r" when "b" or "bh" comes after it) are not arbitrarily decided by someone, but based on sound logic and/or keen observation. If your pronunciation of various sounds is perfect, then grammar rules are actually plain common sense. Conversely, if your pronunciation is not perfect, perhaps because of corruptions in tradition, then grammar rules can help you *reconstruct* the correct pronunciation. But, one thing is certain. Sanskrit grammar rules are logical and not arbitrary.
 
*        *        *
 
As an example, take the vowel "ai" (as in the mahaakaali beeja "aim" or in the words "aindrI" or "aishvarya" or "airaavata"). South Indians pronounce this vowel approximately as "i" in the English words "file" or "mile" or "mine". North Indians pronounce it closer to "ae". They pronounce this vowel approximately as "a" in the English words "bank", "rank", "man" or "fan". Which pronunciation is correct?
 
The vriddhi sandhi rule is a big clue. This sandhi says: a+e=ai (here, a is the first sound of ananta and e is the first sound of etat). For example, tava+eva=tavaiva. If you pronounce the sound "a" and succeed in pronouncing the sound "e" immediately following it, i.e. without ANY break in between, then you WILL end up getting the correct pronunciation of the vowel "ai".
 
If you try this, you will find that the north Indian pronunciation of vowel "ai" as "ae" is correct.
 
*        *        *
 
I will give another example (I am using ITrans transliteration). The vowel "R^i" as in (kR^iShNa or R^iShi or R^ici or R^itam) is mispronounced as "ru" by south Indians and as "ri" by north Indians (e.g. ruShi or riShi). Neither pronunciation is correct. Both are silly, as they contain a consonant and an vowel, instead of just one vowel.
 
The clue to the correct pronunciation is in yaNaadesha sandhi. If "a" comes immediately following "i" or "R^i" or "L^u" or "u", then we get the semi-vowels "ya" or "ra" or "la" or "va" (respectively). If you pronounce "R^i" as either "ru" or "ri" as south/north Indians do and pronounce "a" immediately following it, without ANY break in between, you will end up getting "rva" or "rya" (respectively) and definitely not "ra". That means both are wrong.
 
If you feel inside your mouth what is known as the "vowel trapezium" in modern linguistics, then these 4 vowels are on the top line of the trapezium. The vowel "i" is on the inside edge of the top line and the vowel "u" is on the outside edge of the top line. If you trisect the distance between them, you can locate "R^i" and "L^u" (in the order i, R^i, L^u and u). If you do this and practice the sounds, you will actually find that yaNaadesha sandhi rule is logical and natural. If you pronounce i, R^i, L^u or u and then a, you indeed get ya, ra, la and va.
 
I repeat again. Sanskrit grammar rules like sandhi rules are quite logical and plain common sense. They are not arbitrary. Because of some errors that crept into people's pronunciation, some rules may seem arbitrary. But, if one pronounces sounds as they are meant, sandhi rules are logical.
 
*        *        *
 
One should make one's best effort to pronounce correctly. But pronunciation is only ONE of several factors. A jigsaw puzzle is solved when all the pieces come together. One piece cannot solve the puzzle. Please keep that in mind.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
