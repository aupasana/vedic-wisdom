Dear Sir,
=C2=A0
Your explanation sounds fair enough and logical. I was won=
dering what kind of effects would a Bhairav Homa have. I suppose I could ta=
ke a clue from your description of possible effects of the Chandi Homa. 
=
=C2=A0
I had a very interesting experince today while doing a homa during t=
he meditation. It seemed as if my whole conscinousness was at my head (I me=
an for a brief span it was like my hands and legs did not exist).. and I fe=
lt very light, asif, if I made an effort I might be able to fly. Before tha=
t during the homa the fire was feeling awesome, the hair on my skin stood=
=C2=A0up with each offering into the fire. Whatever it was, it was a strong=
, nice experience.
=C2=A0
-Regards

Namaste,
=C2=A0
It real=
ly depends on the person and his/her karmas.
=C2=A0
In general, after a few=
 months of daily homam, some inner transformation should occur in the way t=
he person views self, others and life. Some clarity should come. Mind shoul=
d be more peaceful and calm (even when engaging in actions that usually spo=
il mental calmness). Even when mental calmness is disturbed temporarily, it=
 should be rstored fast. The impermanence of most things we cling on to sho=
uld be more obvious than before. Devotion should increase.
=C2=A0
Specific =
experiences can vary. If one is ready, meditation at the end of homam can e=
ven make Kundalini rise, but that may need more preparation in most. Some l=
evel of prior inner transformation is needed before that.
=C2=A0
The goal o=
f homam or any other sadhana is inner transformation.
=C2=A0
In addition, s=
ome specific results are possible with different kind of homas. One doing S=
avitri Gayatri homam regularly may experience a sharper intellect and the a=
bility to see things related to knowledge more clearly. One doing Chandi ho=
mam regularly may experience fearlessness, boldness, frankness, detachment =
and the ability to wage a big battle without much attachment. One doing Sri=
 Krishna homam regularly may melt with devotion and=C2=A0start to internall=
y cry for Krishna. Different homas may work in different ways. But they all=
 cause internal transformation, simplify the ego of the person, purify the =
system and clarify thinking.
=C2=A0

Narasimha

Dear Narasmiha
=C2=A0
I was wondering, does=
 doing homa for different deities have different kind of effects. Like if s=
omeone does a Mahaganapati Homa vs someone doing a Homa of Krishna for a co=
nsiderable period of time, is there any set principle that defines what kin=

=C2=A0
I know that it may al=

Namaste,

It is far better to stick to one deity and one h=
omam and do it every 
day/week/fortnight/ month for a duration of time. It =
is a bad idea to do a 
different homam everyday.

Ramakrishna Paramahamsa u=
sed to say "if you want, dig deep in one place. 
Don't dig one foot in one =
place, another foot in another place and so on".

Pick one deity and one ho=
mam and do it continuously for a few months 
atleast. It will do something =
then.

Amavasya is good for worshipping Kaali or Mahalakshmi. Especially 
D=
eepavali/Diwali is a great day to worship Mahalakshmi. So Her homam is a 
g=
ood idea.

Best regards,
Narasimha
