Dear Sharat,

Graha means grasp/grip or one who grasps/grips. The nine grahas are the nine 
celestial bodies that take our consciousness into their grip when the right 
times comes (based on certain celestial formulas). They create environments 
and situations in our life to create certain states of mind.

For removing obstructions in material and spiritual aspects of life, we 
propitiate grahas. If a graha is pleased with our propitiation, it will not 
create situations that create a certain state of mind that may be a 
hindrance to our material and spiritual progress. To propitiate grahas, one 
can read their Veda mantras or kavachas or stotras.

Veda mantras are very powerful. But they work slowly (mainly because most 
people do not know these days how to chant/experience them perfectly). Big 
counts are needed. When you persist with a Veda mantra, it first removes the 
obstacles caused by an aspect of Brahman represented by the deity of the 
mantra and eventually creates a perfect understanding of that aspect of 
Brahman. All Veda mantras are eventually for a perfect understanding of 
various aspects of self only. Sun is the soul. Moon is the mind. Mars is the 
energy/initiative/drive within. Mercury is the flexibility, ability to learn 
and adapt. Jupiter is the wisdom, discretion and judgment within a person. 
Venus is the spirit of being happy. Saturn is the spirit of working hard and 
going through austerities. Rahu is the spirit of breaking the barriers, 
innovating and reaching for the unknown. Ketu is the spirit of perfect 
detachment with everything. Veda mantra of a graha, when chanted for a long 
time, removes the obstacles thrown by that planet based on dasa and gochara 
and eventually gives a perfect understanding of the aspect of self 
represented by the planet (as mentioned above).

Kavachas of grahas, when chanted many times, create an unseen protective 
shield around the person. Kavachas can be used for overcoming physical 
ailments, health troubles, prayogas etc. Stotras are meant for pure bhakti 
maarga. They praise various qualities of a graha. In addition, there are 
various beeja mantras also.

According to Parasara Maharshi who taught "Brihat Paaraasara Horaa 
Saastram", the greatest classic on Jyotisha, grahas are Vishnu's avataras. 
They comprise of the energies of various incarnations of Vishnu. 
Ramachandra's energy is Sun. Krishna's energy is Moon. Nrisimha's energy is 
Mars. Buddha's energy is Mercury. Vaamana's energy is Jupiter. Parasu 
Raama's energy is Venus. Koorma's energy is Saturn. Varaha's energy is Rahu. 
Matsya's energy is Ketu.

Apart of doing japam with these graha mantras/kavachas/stotras, one can also 
do a homam. Homam is always a better avenue than japam and others. In 
navagraha homam, you invoke the nine grahas in fire and offer oblations with 
their Veda mantras several times. It is also possible to do a homam for just 
one graha.

One word about the efficacy of homam...

Seeing divinity in a solid form such as an idol is shown by earth (bhoo) 
element. It is a sureshot way to achieve, but it is extremely slow and one 
needs to be very patient. It is difficult to maintain focus for so many 
lives in Kali yuga. One can lose one's way in the middle. Seeing divinity in 
the water is shown by the water (jala) element. The water element is anyway 
predominent in the human body and it is imperfect in Kali yuga. It is quite 
tricky to achieve through sadhana shown by the water path in this age. 
Seeing divinity in the air we breath is the sadhana form shown by air 
(vaayu) element. It is fast, but the air we breath in so corrupt in this age 
that this is a very risky path. Though many teach praanaayaama, hatha yoga, 
raja yoga etc these days, this path is extremely risky. It is very difficult 
to reach the end goal in this path in this age. The path of pure Vedanta, 
shown by the aakaasa (ether/space) element may also not be appropriate for 
most in this age.

Irrespective of the impurities in the food one eats, the water one drinks 
and the air one breathes and irrespective of the impurities in various nadis 
in one's system, the fire is always pure and it purifies everything that it 
comes in touch with. That is why another name of fire is "paavaka" 
(purifier). You just have to expose various parts of your system to fire. 
Thus, the sadhana form shown by fire (agni) element is the safest and 
quickest in this age for most people. It is quick and safe and purifies one 
despite other distractions of Kali and helps one achieve the Ultimate 
eventually.

It is possible to get *some result* in every sadhana. But, if one wants to 
make significant progress, homam is the best sadhana. No wonder rishis put a 
lot of stress on agni kaaryam (fire ritual). These days, people - even those 
who are born in Brahmin families - are afraid to do homam because they think 
it is complicated and one may make mistakes. However, a homam done as a 
personal sadhana for one's own progress is different from a yaagam that is 
done for universal benefits. While the latter is far more elaborate and 
strict, the former is much simpler. When performed on a regular basis, it 
really purifies one's koshas and nadis.

Regularity is the key. If you eat a big bowl of almonds once every six 
months, you will not get enough proteins for the six months from them. On 
the other hand, if eat a few almonds *everyday*, that may be a good source 
of proteins.

We eat a few times everyday, we drink water a few times everyday; and we 
breath many times everyday (and all these activities are constantly pumping 
in impurities into our system!). We should also do sadhana also on a regular 
basis.

Whichever deity one wants to worship, one can worship the deity in fire for 
faster results. This applies to Mahaganapathi, Chandi, Shiva, Lakshmi, 
Narayana or Grahas.

Best regards,
Narasimha
