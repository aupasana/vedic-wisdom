Namaste Narasimha & Ravi

I really appreciate the reply to this thread as I am just starting my 
conversion process and formally changing my name, I have followed 
Sanatan Dharma for over 15 years getting a grasp of Brahminical 
qualities, Veda, Vedanta, Jyotish all those things and homam and I 
worship Shivalingam daily and do 1008 mantras and this post really 
helped me, thank you for the great explenation.

                <br>
Well, our shastras do not define a religion called "Hinduism". Our
shastras define sanatana dharma - the perennial path of righteous duty.
Sanatana dharma is not an exclusive property of people born to "Hindu"
parents. Sanatana dharma belongs to the entire world and encompasses
every human being whether or not one realizes it!<br>
                <br>
Some people who consider themselves Hindus may or may not be following
dharma well.<br>
                <br>
There may not be much difference between somebody from another religion
with a strong interest in "Hinduism" and somebody born to Hindu parents
but having either passive interest or disinterest in Sanatana dharma
and teachings of rishis. In fact, the former may be a better adherent
of Sanatana dharma than the latter in some cases! If there is no need
to convert the latter to "Hinduism", there is no need to convert the
former either!<br>
                <br>
Several ceremonies like naamakarana samskaara (naming) are more social
customs than dharmik matters.<br>
                <br>
In my opinion, if a person is given a Vedic or Pouraanik mantra (any)
by a decent guru and asked to chant it everyday for an amount of time,
and if he/she is exposed to some scripture (e.g. Gita, Upanishads etc)
and asked to read it, understand it and let it affect one's thinking, I
think one is then a Hindu, i.e. one will soon find oneself adhering to
Sanatana dharma. There is no need for any ceremonies.<br>
                <br>
*        *        *<br>
                <br>
In fact, now there are some "foreigners" who perform a homam every
weekend, to Ganapathi, Krishna etc. If anybody thinks they are not
"Hindus", one is not thinking straight. They are more Hindus than many
Hindus in India who have forgotten their dharma.<br>
                <br>
A braahmana's dharma is to pursue spiritual progress and engage the
mind in the god for the benefit of the world. One who does not spend
time in japam or homam for the benefit of the world is not a braahmana.
If a foreigner is passionately interested in spiritual progress and
does japam or homam every day or week for the benefit of the world and
one's own spiritual upliftment, such a foreigner is not only a Hindu,
but also a braahmana.<br>
                <br>
