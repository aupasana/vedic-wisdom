Namaste,
 
I admire the desire to maintain purity. However, let me say one =
humble word.
 
The new paint, washing of the floor etc make the house "phys=
ically clean", but not mecessarily "pure".
 
Qualities like desires, anger,=
 greed, false pride, wantonness and jealosy in the minds of people sitting =
at a ritual are what make the place impure for gods to come. If people with=
 devotion, surrender, equanimity and some control over the shadripus mentio=
ned above are sitting at a ritual, the place is *pure* even if the paint is=
 old and the floor unwashed and dusty and gods do come.
 
External cleanlin=
ess is a catalyst in the beginning. It instills the feeling of doing someth=
ing "special" and "pure" and brings some devotion into the mind. However, e=
xternal cleanliness is neither necessary nor sufficient for bringing intern=
al purification, which is the real target. One clinging on to external clea=
nliness and not making an effort to clean up internal dirt will remain stuc=
k.
 
*        *        *
 
The whole reason why rituals like homam are need=
ed is that one is impure and wants to become pure. Maintain external cleanl=
iness *to the extent possible* and keep performing homam. It will slowly pu=
rify you from inside. Doing a simple homam every day or week is far more us=
eful than painting the house, washing the floor and doing it once a year.
 =

*        *        *
 
If one feels that one's surroundings are impure and =
one is committing a mistake, that thought will corrupt the ritual and stop =
it from working optimally. One should try to overcome such thoughts. I sugg=
est the following simple principles:
 
(1) As far as external cleanliness i=
s concerned, do whatever you can realistically do every day or every week, =
but do not get bogged down. Elaborate measures make it unrealistic to do ev=
ery day or week. Choose your measures so that they can be repeated every da=
y or week. These measures are meant for *optimizing* the ritual experience =
and not meant for *blocking* the ritual itself due to fears!
 
(2) When you=
 read "Gange cha Yamune chaiva..." and sprinke that water all arond you, im=
agine that the purest rivers have joined that water and purified you, your =
materials and surroundings. If you *truly believe* it, where is the worry o=
f impurity?
 
Mind is the problem and mind is the solution. Purity, impurit=
y - it is all in the mind. You engage in external actions that promote cert=
ain thoughts in the mind. When you sprinkle yourself, your materials and su=
rroundings with water after that mantra and Varuna beeja, you should fully =
believe that everything is pure.
 
(3) At the end, when you say "sarvam Sri=
 Krishnaarpanamastu", really imagine that Krishna is the doer and you are a=
 mere instrument.
 
*        *        *
 
One pure-hearted lady who used to=
 visit and help Sarada Mata at the Dakshineshwar temple once cleaned the to=
ilets there and immediately made prasad for the temple without taking bath.=
 Though others were offended and thought that prasad was unsuitable for off=
ering to god, Sarada Mata disagreed with them.
 
I am not saying that you s=
hould wash toilets and then make prasad. Do whatever measures of external c=
leanliness you can take realistically, without putting the ritual itself in=
 jeopardy.
 
But do not focus your mind on the external measures and get lo=
st in them. Focus it instead on god.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

am and Kedareswrara swamy vratam , after painting our home (in telugu we sa=
y ellalu veyinchina tarvata matrame) and no women when they are in periods =
should not enter into home till completion of the vratam.

the case , then how can i do homam at home , i dont have seperate pooja roo=
m ?
   
  How can i clean my home before doing homam ?
  (homam chaala pavi=
tram ga , nishta ga cheyali ani)

f shape square or it can be any , i am not getting square shaped utensil at=
