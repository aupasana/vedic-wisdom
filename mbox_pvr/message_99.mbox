Dear Kris,

It can be practiced in meditation. The higher states of deep sleep aren't 
more easily achievable from the sleep state, just because they are labeled 
with the word "sleep". One is better off trying to reach them in meditation.

You may be interested in the seven states described by Maharshi Vasishtha to 
Lord Ramachandra in "Yoga Vaasishtham". The same book contains a description 
of three very high states by Lord Shiva to Maharshi Vasishtha.

Best regards,
Narasimha
