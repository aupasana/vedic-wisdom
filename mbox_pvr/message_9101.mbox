Namaste Sir,
=C2=A0
People may misunderstand the word "mokShayiShyAmi" (I s=
hall liberate) in that verse based on what their conditioning tells them li=
beration is. To get a correct understanding, one may need to combine knowle=
dge from other scriptures.
=C2=A0
As an example, if the body of one having =
an attachment to the body is afflicted with cancer, one may see it as a pro=
blem. Because one feels attachment and responsibility towards the body, one=
 may be thinking about how to fix it and may get agitated. So, one is not f=
ree from the negative repercussions of that cancer. But, when Ramana Mahars=
hi or Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had cancer, they did not view it as a problem=
 and displayed the same attitude and mental equanimity. So, while their *bo=
dies* experienced the repercussions of that cancer, "they" were free from t=
hem.
=C2=A0
If one has surrendered one's sense of duty/responsibility towar=
ds *everything* as Lord says in that verse ("sarva dharmAn parityajya"), wh=
ere "everything" inlcudes body, name, wife, children, properties etc, then =
anything bad (or good) happening to those entities will not touch one or bi=
nd one. One is "free" from those happenings. *That* liberation is what Lord=
 says he shall give and the pre-condition is to give up any sense of duty/r=
esponsibility towards anything.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Though some =
people interpret "dharma" in this verse as a religious path, the real meani=
ng of dharma is "duty, that which is correct". We have a sense of responsib=
ility towards so many entities, stemming from our conditioning (vasana). Th=
is includes a sense of responsibility towards body, name, wife, children, p=
arents, relatives, community, country, religion, subjects of study (e.g. Jy=
otish) etc etc. Every sense of "I need to do this", whether noble or evil, =
comes from one's conditioning and *binds* one. If one surrenders all these,=
 i.e. effectively one surrenders one's entire conditioning, at Lord's feet =
and accepts whatever happens to one as god's prasad, then one is liberated.=

=C2=A0
Based on the "momentum" from actions before liberation, one may fac=
e various life situations even after liberation. In one case, one may get c=
ancer and die. In another case, one may roam the world and spread Sanatana =
Dharma. In another case, one may sit in a cave and meditate for 10,000 more=
 years. In another case, one may roam the streets looking like a mad person=
. In another case, one may continue to work as a day labourer. In another c=
ase, one may destroy a kingdom in a battle. And so on. In all these cases, =
the liberated being has surrendered all preferences, all likes and dislikes=
, all agendas, attachments and sense of resposibility towards everything on=
e has (body, name, wife, children etc and all attributes of the body-mind c=
omplex that once ruled the roost) and engages in spontaneous actions based =
on the circumstances one finds oneself in, based on pre-existing momentum. =
Nothing that happens to one binds one and nothing that one does binds one.
=
=C2=A0
Liberation does not mean that all of one's belongings (body, name, f=
amily, community etc) are "safe" and "well". Nor does it mean that one does=
 nothing. Things may keep happening to one and one may keep doing things. Y=
et, one is untouched by them, like a water drop on a lotus leaf, because on=
e has no desires, demands, preferences or agendas and accepts whatever Lord=
 gives.
=C2=A0

=C2=A0
One who tells Krishna, "I surrender to=
 you. I will not follow any religion or rituals or gods and just pray to yo=
u. So forgive all my sins and make sure that only good things befall my bod=
y, my name, my family etc [because I really care about them and any damage =
to them will upset me]" has missed the point big time! The sublime verse yo=
u referred to is like the culmination of entire Bhagavad Gita and is the es=
sence of all Upanishads.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
One word of caution. =
IMHO, what follows is far more relevant to most readers of this writeup tha=
n what lies above!
=C2=A0
This verse is the essence of Self-knowledge. But =
most people of this era are unlikely to realize Self (until the end of this=
 yuga cycle). So my suggestion is to set more reasonable goals. It is ok if=
 you haven't surrendered all of your dharmas to Lord.
=C2=A0
!!!!! In fact,=
 even if you try, you will probably end up misusing that notion to run away=
 from most of your higher (and selfless) dharmas and yet end up sticking to=
 your lowest and most selfish dharmas (e.g. dharma towards body and its sur=
vival instinct, very tough to shake off). That is useless. !!!!! 
=C2=A0
No=
 wonder Vedanta comes at the end of all Veda and the verse above comes afte=
r so many chapters on so many other things. Don't jump to it right away!
=
=C2=A0
First *expand* your sense of self and your sense of responsibility a=
nd attachment to be more inclusive. Current body-mind complex we inhabit is=
 a very limited notion of self. Expand it to family, then to community, the=
n to town, then to nation etc. Or may be to a large community of people wit=
h certain attributes. Basically, try to put others before you, learn to sac=
rifice and engage in more selfless actions than selfish actions. Not everyo=
ne may be liberated in this life, but everyone can make SOME progress towar=
ds it!
=C2=A0

Narasimha

tually sanchita karmas are also karmas already done. Sanchita means "piled =
up". Prarabdha karmas are different in the sense that their fructification =
has already begun. The verb "prArabh" means "to begin". Its noun form "prAr=
ambha" means "beginning" and its gerund noun form "prArabdha" means "the [o=
ne that was] begun". Prarabdha karmas are actions for which the process of =
reaction has already begun and in the pipeline. Whereas sanchita karmas are=
 piled up karmas that have not kicked off their fruits yet. They can be del=
ayed indefinitely. If one becomes liberated while living, one can merge in =
Cosmic Self without experiencing the fruits of sanchita karmas. However, fr=
uits of prarabdha karmas are already in the pipeline and need to be experie=
nced even by a liberated being.

nd the word "mokShayiShyAmi" (I shall liberate) in that verse based on what=
 their conditioning tells them liberation is. To get a correct understandin=
g, one may need to combine knowledge from other scriptures.<br> <br>As=
 an example, if the body of one having an attachment to the body is afflict=
ed with cancer, one may see it as a problem. Because one feels attachment a=
nd responsibility towards the body, one may be thinking about how to fix it=
 and may get agitated. So, one is not free from the negative repercussions =
of that cancer. But, when Ramana Maharshi or Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had ca=
ncer, they did not view it as a problem and displayed the same attitude
 an=
d mental equanimity. So, while their *bodies* experienced the repercussions=
 of that cancer, "they" were free from them.<br> <br>If one has surren=
dered one's sense of duty/responsibility towards *everything* as Lord says =
in that verse ("sarva dharmAn parityajya"), where "everything" inlcudes bod=
y, name, wife, children, properties etc, then anything bad (or good) happen=
ing to those entities will not touch one or bind one. One is "free" from th=
ose happenings. *That* liberation is what Lord says he shall give and the p=
re-condition is to give up any sense of duty/responsibility towards anythin=
g.<br> <br>*        *  &n=
bsp;     *<br> <br>Though some people interpret "d=
harma" in this verse as a religious path, the real meaning of dharma is "du=
ty, that which is correct". We have a sense of responsibility towards so ma=
ny entities, stemming from our conditioning (vasana). This
 includes a sens=
e of responsibility towards body, name, wife, children, parents, relatives,=
 community, country, religion, subjects of study (e.g. Jyotish) etc etc. Ev=
ery sense of "I need to do this", whether noble or evil, comes from one's c=
onditioning and *binds* one. If one surrenders all these, i.e. effectively =
one surrenders one's entire conditioning, at Lord's feet and accepts whatev=
er happens to one as god's prasad, then one is liberated.<br> <br>Base=
d on the "momentum" from actions before liberation, one may face various li=
fe situations even after liberation. In one case, one may get cancer and di=
e. In another case, one may roam the world and spread Sanatana Dharma. In a=
nother case, one may sit in a cave and meditate for 10,000 more years. In a=
nother case, one may roam the streets looking like a mad person. In another=
 case, one may continue to work as a day labourer. In another case, one may=
 destroy a kingdom in a battle. And so on. In all
 these cases, the liberat=
ed being has surrendered all preferences, all likes and dislikes, all agend=
as, attachments and sense of resposibility towards everything one has (body=
, name, wife, children etc and all attributes of the body-mind complex that=
 once ruled the roost) and engages in spontaneous actions based on the circ=
umstances one finds oneself in, based on pre-existing momentum. Nothing tha=
t happens to one binds one and nothing that one does binds one.<br> <b=
r>Liberation does not mean that all of one's belongings (body, name, family=
, community etc) are "safe" and "well". Nor does it mean that one does noth=
ing. Things may keep happening to one and one may keep doing things. Yet, o=
ne is untouched by them, like a water drop on a lotus leaf, because one has=
 no desires, demands, preferences or agendas and accepts whatever Lord give=
s.<br> <br>*        *  &n=
bsp;    
 *<br> <br>One who tells Krishna, "I surr=
ender to you. I will not follow any religion or rituals or gods and just pr=
ay to you. So forgive all my sins and make sure that only good things befal=
l my body, my name, my family etc [because I really care about them and any=
 damage to them will upset me]" has missed the point big time! The sublime =
verse you referred to is like the culmination of entire Bhagavad Gita and i=
s the essence of all Upanishads.<br> <br>*    &nbs=
p;   *        *<br> <br>O=
ne word of caution. IMHO, what follows is far more relevant to most readers=
 of this writeup than what lies above!<br> <br>This verse is the essen=
ce of Self-knowledge. But most people of this era are unlikely to realize S=
elf (until the end of this yuga cycle). So my suggestion is to set more rea=
sonable goals. It is ok if you haven't surrendered all of your dharmas to
 =
Lord.<br> <br>!!!!! In fact, even if you try, you will probably end up=
 misusing that notion to run away from most of your higher (and selfless) d=
harmas and yet end up sticking to your lowest and most selfish dharmas (e.g=
. dharma towards body and its survival instinct, very tough to shake off). =
That is useless. !!!!! <br> <br>No wonder Vedanta comes at the end of =
all Veda and the verse above comes after so many chapters on so many other =
things. Don't jump to it right away!<br> <br>First *expand* your sense=
 of self and your sense of responsibility and attachment to be more inclusi=
ve. Current body-mind complex we inhabit is a very limited notion of self. =
Expand it to family, then to community, then to town, then to nation etc. O=
r may be to a large community of people with certain attributes. Basically,=
 try to put others before you, learn to sacrifice and engage in more selfle=
ss actions than selfish actions. Not everyone may be liberated in
 this lif=
e, but everyone can make SOME progress towards it!<br> <br>Best regard=

reach a state of mind where one can accept the fruits of all karmas as pras=

agitated that we lose our balance and our judgment gets badly beated. This =
may result in further bad karmas being committed in that agitated/confused =
state.<br> <br>Thus, it IS sometimes useful to push off some really ba=

 a calmer state of mind in that borrowed time, one may be able to handle th=

a really bad karma, makes progress during that borrowed
 time, reaches an e=

ch the process of reaction has already begun and in the pipeline. Whereas s=
anchita karmas are piled up karmas that have not kicked off their fruits ye=

 maintained even in the middle of a tumultous hurricane caused in one's lif=
e due to serious bad karmas from the past. Once serious troubles set in or =
mind focuses on sense objects, material world and one's pleasures and pains=

selfish agendas and starts performing even more bad karmas. Thus, praying t=
o God and contemplating various ideals and qualities that God represents ca=
n give a shelter to the mind in

/span> Karmaphala for a specific karma is not a function of that karma alon=
e. It is a function of that karma and one's current state of mind. If someo=
ne serves spoiled food, one may get an upset stomach for half day or diaria=
 for a week. It depends on how strong one is. Similarly, the same karmaphal=
a set in motion by the same external agents of delivery (physical & sub=
tle) can cause different reaction inside one, depending on one's current st=
ate of mind.<br> <br>An idle mind is devil's workshop. Our minds keep =
vibrating with various notions and thoughts. A mind vibrating with selfish =
desires and unnecessary clutter/confusion *amplifies* the negative effects =
of one's environment (through which fruits of karmas are
 administered).<br=
> <br>If one thinks of ishta devata with reverence and contemplates va=
rious ideals and qualities of ishta devata and mind vibrates with saattwik =
energy, it absorbs the negative effects of one's environment better or at l=
east does not amplify them.<br> <br>Best regards,<br>Narasimha<br>----=

      <div>Dear Digamber,</div><div><br></div><div>When a kingdom h=

<div><br></div><div>=
Vasishtha gives two answers: (1) This is the karma of the ministers, king, =
and all the citizens, and (2) This is the karma of the beggar turned king.<=
/div><div><br></div><div>Everything is interrelated. The beggar's karma mad=
e him a king. The elephant's karma allowed him to be the one chosen to pick=
 the king. The minister's karma allowed them to appoint the elephant to pic=
k the king. And the citizens' karma allowed them to live in such a kingdom,=
 and accept the result.</div>

<div><br></div><div>The sanskrit word "shaap=
a" means a curse, or promise, or oath. Many of the curses that we see are f=

<div><br></div><div>When it comes to peop=

 there is a person, and separate from the person are his many karmas. These=

    &nb=

(1) When someone =
gives a `curse' or does a prayoga such as `maran' or `uchhatan' what happen=

is it a new parabdha that is created. I vaguely remember Vimalananda mentio=

(2) On simila=

e also come across lot of tantric items like Rudraksha, Parad Shivalinga or=
 say Shwetarka Ganapati =E2=80=93 what do this items really do if they work=
? Something similar with wearing gemstones for planets =E2=80=93 do they br=
