Namaste,

If you learnt how to perform Sri Chakra pooja, there is no problem in doing 
it yourself. Do it with a spirit of humility and devotion and think: "I 
don't know the correct way to do it and am doing it to the best of my 
ability. Please forgive me for my mistakes and give me a hand to lift me 
up".

A lot of people are very afraid of a lot of saattwik rituals also these days 
and prefer to call a priest for everything. It is perfectly fine to do a lot 
of saattwik rituals by oneself. The above attitude helps too.

Best regards,
Narasimha
