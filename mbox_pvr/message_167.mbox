Dear Ramakrishna garu,
 
Hoping that you do not mind, I am cc'ing this mail=
 to some yahoogroups.
 
What you mentioned in (1) is correct, with an O mad=
e with the index finger and thumb. Though (2) and (3) are also acceptable, =
(1) is the best.
 
Chinmudra is identical to jnaana mudra, except that the =
palms face down. In jnana mudra, palms face up.
 
Actually, I suggest a mix=
ture of the two mudras. Make a circle with the index finger and thumb with =
the tips touching. Do it on both the hands. Make the right hand's palm face=
 up (in jnaana mudra) and the left hand's palm face down (in chinmudra). Th=
e two circles generate flow of energy in different directions and balance n=
icely. With the right hand (pingala nadi - jnaana/wisdom), we are making jn=
aana mudra. With the left hand (ida nadi - surrender), we are making chinmu=
dra. This mixed mudra is powerful and is a very balanced mudra to use in me=
ditation.
 
The path of knowledge and wisdom (jnaana - pingala) is good and=
 the path of surrender and submission (bhakti - ida) is good too. But mixin=
g both is the balanced way.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

  Dear PVR garu,

  Namaste.

  I have confusion on the placement =
of index and thumb fingers regarding Jnana Mudra.
  Got three different ver=
sions.

  1) A google search on "Jnana Mudra" shows a lot of images where t=
ip of index finger is touched with the tip of the thumb.

  However, I reme=
mber this being taught to me as "Chin Mudra" in one of Yoga classes. (And t=
hat the same mudra with the other 3 fingers closed becomes "Chinmaya Mudra"=
.)

  http://www.yoga.net.au/uploads/images/14/Jnana.gif

  2) An instructr=
or from a different yoga school taught us that the tip of the index finger =
should touch the root of the thumb and thumb should press the bent index fi=
nger with the other 3 fingers open.

  http://www.centrejaya.org/IMG/jpg/jn=
ana_mudra.jpg

  (In the above image, thumb is not pressing the index finge=
r ; but we were taught to press)

  3) A local priest told me that the tip =
of the index finger should touch the line in the middle of the thumb (i.e n=
ot at the tip, not at the root but the middle line). He also said that the =
same mudra, when palm is raised to the shoulder level with the open palm fa=
cing away from us becomes "Upasana Mudra" and that Lord Dakshina Murthy is =
sitting in this position. (with one hand, but for Upasana mudra we have to =
do the same with both hands).

  http://www.federationyoga.qc.ca/mudra.JPG
=

  Also, I noticed 2 versions of doing (1) and (3). While some people are m=
aintaing 'O' shape between the index finger and thumb (i.e. index finger is=
 curved) , others are bending the index finger at right angles at the first=
 and second bends / lines (when counted from the tip). So the first version=
 is little relaxed than the second.

  Could you please clarify which is co=
rrect posture for Jnana Mudra ?

  Thanks and Regards,
  Ramakrishna
