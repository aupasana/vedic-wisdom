Namaste,
 
As Ajit Krishnan has clarified correctly, Maha Shivaratri is to be observed on the night of March 5 (Wednesday - today) in the entire north America.
 
Some temples in USA are observing it on Thursday night, but there ARE some temples that are observing it correctly on Wednesday.
 
Happy Maha Shivaratri to all of you!
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

Chaturdashi starts around 3 pm EST on March 5 and ends on Thursday, March 6 around 2 pm EST. I assumed that you would fast and pray the night of March 5 but our temple priests insists that we need to celebrate it on the midnight of March 6, when, in fact, it will be amavasya during the entire night...
