Namaste Ashwin ji,
 
Well, I am truly sorry that I disappointed you.
 
Thak=
ur isn't an ordinary being. Giving samadhi to a highly logical person (logi=
cal mind is a great obstacle) like Naren just by a mere touch is no ordinar=
y feat. He not only experienced sahaja samadhi himself, which is off limits=
 for even great siddhas, but induced it in Naren for a few days by the powe=
r of his thought. All these are signs of a being of the highest class.
 
Kn=
owing what kind a being Ramakrishna is, I am not too surprised or excited b=
y what you said. I am really and genuinely sorry that you expected a differ=
ent reaction from me. But I don't feign a reaction that I do not really fee=
l. I am really sorry.
 
What you described IS a miracle. I do not doubt it =
at all. I am sorry if I gave that impression.
 
*        *        *
 
Hones=
tly, when I read several of the miraculous deeds of Ramakrishna, I do not f=
eel much excitement or emotion. I don't know why. On the other hand, simple=
 episodes like how he cried and begged Vivekananda not to leave make me wee=
p. He transformed Naren from an overly logical young boy to a mature man wi=
th the highest vairagya and he gave Naren many tremendous spiritual experie=
nces. Later Vivekananda said that the "mad brahmin" transformed him and mad=
e him who he was. He said Ramakrishna could have created 100 Vivekanandas f=
rom dirt! Yet, Ramakrishna did not feel any entitlement or ownership and, i=
nstead, he cried and begged his disciple to not leave and do the Mother's w=
ork. What a pure and sattwik soul! When I think of his attitude, I get goos=
ebumps.
 
When I read how he simply left the premises when told by a repres=
entative of Mathur that he was dismissed and had to leave the temple and ho=
w he came back as if nothing happned when Mathur came and fell at his feet =
and how he behaved the same way as if nothing happened in both cases is a p=
ractical demonstration of what Krishna taught in Gita. When I read about th=
at, I melt in emotion.
 
Thus, simple episodes bringing out the attitude of=
 Thakur and illustrate how a sthita prajna described by Krishna in Gita beh=
aves excite me.
 
The things about Ramakrishna that excite me, make me weep=
 and make me emotional may be a little different from some other people.
 
=
Bottomline is that Thakur exictes both of us. Perhaps there are different a=
spects of Thakur that we are attached to and attracted to. But the good thi=
ng is that we are both attracted to him.
 
*        *        *
 
Suppose wh=
at he said to Sarada Mata was only a "desire" and it did not happen. Suppos=
e he is reborn after 150 years and has not yet come back. My point is that =
even then some people may have experiences of seeing his old embodied form,=
 even as he exists on earth in a different body.
 
*        *        *
 
Ag=
ain, I am sincerely sorry for disappointing a sincere and blessed devotee o=
f Thakur. :-(
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

        Dear Narsimhaji,
        I have joined this group for la=
st one year. I have read your valuable articles on this site. I also knew t=
hat you are the lover and follower of Shri Shri Thakur. This was the reason=
 I wrote this mail on Thakur. I have narrated this incident to very few peo=
ple who are loving Thakur and when I told this incident they all were weepi=
ng. But I am sorry that your mail disappointed me. You have given analysis =
of this incident on intellectual level or it was more logical and less devo=
tional. I was expecting the excitement in your mail but you just justified =
that it is possible as our faith is working...!!!
        Dear Sir, for you=
r information I would write that when this incident happened I was not know=
ing Thakur, nor was any devotion towards Him. It was due to Mr. Patel I had=
 just taken the decision to accept HIM as my Guru. I was also upset in the =
morning after discussion with my wife and started thinking that my decision=
 was hasty. I just taken a chance as I was told by Mr. Patel that you can t=
est Thakur before you accept him as your Guru. I remembered his words that =
morning and told my wife that if my decision is right, Mr. Patel should com=
e to my house. I was not knowing then actually Mr. Patel will come to my pl=
ace within 10 minutes and Thakur will show him the way to my home. 
       =
 You have written that Thakur might have taken rebirth after 100 years. I t=
hink this was his desire and not necessary he is already born now.It is His=
 will to take 100 years or 150 years for re-birth. I am now strongly believ=
e that Thakur is still alive on earth because my another incidents are also=
 leading me to believe that He is coming to this earth. Mr. Patel was exper=
iencing him very offen. 
        It was a miracle and whenever I remember t=
his day I am excited. I am not his staunch devotee even today but still He =
is with me, He loves me rather. Oh, what to say !

          Dear Ashwin ji=
,

          It is a very interesting episode you have narrated! Thank you =
for sharing it.

          After Ramakrishna left his body, several people =
saw him in embodied form.

          That is entirely possible. When someon=
e who did not identify with a body but identified with the entire universe =
lives in a body and leaves, it is not like he has left. He is still there, =
in every atom and in everything. If someone is attached to him with that bo=
dy of his and he has compassion for that person, he *can* give darshan to t=
hat person in that body. It is not that he is "alive" or "dead". It is just=
 that he is in every atom or sub-atomic particle of this creation because h=
e has realized the true nature of Self while living in the previous body an=
d that realization was intact even while leaving that body.

          Acco=
rding to Sarada Mata, Ramakrishna told her and Lakshmi that he would be bac=
k after 100 years and that all of them would have to be reborn when he is r=
eborn after 100 years. Thus, he may have already come to earth in a differe=
nt body. But that does not matter. Those who have an attachment to Ramakris=
hna and stuck at the lower level form may still be able to access his previ=
ous form.

          Even after the form of Rama left this world and the fo=
rm of Krishna was born, a devotee of Rama who does great tapascharya for Ra=
ma may be able to realize a darshan of the form of Rama.

          Ramakri=
shna Paramahamsa was almost certainly an avatara.

ve today

                  Dear Sir, I would like to share one of my great=
 Devine experience about shri Ramkrishnadev. This is an unbelievable experi=
ence that I have had. I have not added anything from my own. I am writing e=
xactly as was happened in my life. I am going back to the period of 1973/74=
. Kindly read this only when you are in religious mood. 

                 =
  

                  I was working as telegraphist at Okha Port Post offic=
e near Dwarka. My duty was from 7 am to 7 pm and I was getting late fee all=
owance for extra duty. There was a Telephone exchange just opposite to Post=
 office and due to same Dep=E2=80=99t; I had friendship with some Telephone=
 operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel) was wo=
rking as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of    shri Ramkrishnadev. Whene=
ver I was meeting him he was always talking about shri Thakur. We came clos=
e day by day. There was a weekly gathering at his home called SATSANGA. He =
was singing devotional songs created by him and was weeping while singing. =
He was reading Ramkrishna Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending=
 this weekly meeting on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Pate=
l was of 30 then. We were used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after duty h=
ours and were talking only about Thakur. 

                  One day when w=
e were at sea shore he suddenly told me--=E2=80=9CRawalbhai, some guest hav=
e come to my home and my wife is remembering me. My son will come in a few =
minutes to call me. I shall have to go now=E2=80=9D. -- And with my surpris=
e his 8 years old son came to call him. 

                  At one another =
incident he told me that there will be a plane crash tomorrow and that also=
 happened. I was very much impressed about him. He could foresee the events=
. One day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus, he told me not to go through bus, a=
s bus tire will be punctured. Yet I went to Bus station but bus did not com=
e from Dwarka as was punctured on the way. This was surprising. 

         =
         This all incidents made me to believe that he had some super power=
 and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was attracted to shri Th=
akur. One day I thought, I should also be disciple of shri Thakur and the d=
ay came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered myself to Thakur at Mr. Pat=
el=E2=80=99s house before Thakur picture. I prayed him deeply from my heart=
 to accept me as his follower and bestow his grace. 

                  Nex=
t day morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 morning while taking =
the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was waking up at 5.45 morning.=
 I told to my wife in the morning that I have accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev a=
s my Gurudev. My wife was annoyed and she argued with me a lot. =E2=80=94=
=E2=80=9CWhy should you take such a hasty decision? Ramkrishna Paramhamsa w=
as a devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta. He was a great Saint but our Guru sho=
uld be living one, who can guide us, give us Mantra etc. etc. Better you ta=
ke Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma Acharya since you are doing Gayatri Mantra=E2=
=80=9D--. 

                  Her arguments were right at her place as peop=
le in general not know much about Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- ye=
s I have taken hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. -- 

  =
                But I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was t=
elling their disciples to test him before accepting him. I also decided to =
test Thakur. I immediately told my wife that =E2=80=93=E2=80=9CSee, Mr. Pat=
el has never come to our home. You have also not seen him. He has never ask=
ed me where I am living. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to our house within 10=
 to 15 minutes, would you believe that my selection for Thakur is perfect?=
=E2=80=9D-- 

                  She laughed at me=E2=80=94=E2=80=9CHow it i=
s possible? I don=E2=80=99t believe.=E2=80=9D-- 

                  I praye=
d Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediately to justify my decision and conv=
ince my wife. =E2=80=98I want to test your existence even today.=E2=80=99 
=

                  To our great surprise, Mr. Patel was at my home at 06.30=
 in the morning with angry mood. What he told? 

                  =E2=80=
=98 How dare you test Thakur this way? Do you know what happened? Yesterday=
 was my night duty and I had just come to my home at 05.30 mornings today a=
nd tried to sleep for 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly Thakur pulled my blanket and t=
old me that-=E2=80=9C Go to your friend=E2=80=99s house. He is waiting for =
you. He wants to test me. I will show you his house=E2=80=9D 

            =
      I immediately rushed to your home. Thakur was guiding me the way to y=
our house and pushing me too. What you want? Why you are disturbing him in =
such an early morning for such a silly things?=E2=80=99 

                 =
 We both were so excited and surprised that we had no words that Morning. 
=

                  I will never forget that 5th April, a miracle day in my =
life. There were some more Devine experiences about Shri Thakur but I will =
write it sometime. 

                  Dear Sir, and forum members, Ramkris=
handev is still alive on the earth. This is a fact I have written and no wo=
rd is added to exaggerate.  May Shri Thakur bless all of us.

I have joined this group for last one year. I

       =

     =
   logical and less devotional. I was expecting the 
        <STRONG>excite=

        is possi=

        that when this =
incident happened I was not knowing Thakur, nor was any 
        devotion t=

   =
     I just taken a chance as I was told by Mr. Patel that you can test 
  =
      Thakur before you accept him as your Guru. I remembered his words tha=

        morning and told my wife that if my decision is right, Mr. Patel=
 should 
        come to my house. I was not knowing then actually Mr. Pate=

        my place within 10 minutes and Thakur will show him=
 the way to my home.
