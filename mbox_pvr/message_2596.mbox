Namaste,
 
(1) Dharma is personal. Dharma means the right action. The right=
 action changes from person to person and from situation to situation.
 
De=
pending on your vasanas from previous lives and depending on your current d=
esa-kaala-paatra, Nature expects something from you. What Nature expects fr=
om you, i.e. what you are capable of doing based on your vaasanas and rinas=
 that fits with Nature's big scheme at that time, becomes your dharma. Unfo=
rtunately, it is not always easy to know one's dharma. When one has a dense=
 ego and strong desires, they corrupt one's vision and stop one from findin=
g out one's dharma correctly. As one's ego reduces and one's desires become=
 less and less, one gets more in tune in with Nature and the clarity of vis=
ion regarding one's own dharma improves. As one fulfils one's understanding=
 of one's dharma impassionately without getting entangled in the web of lik=
es, dislikes, expectations, excitement, disappointment etc, it offloads mor=
e and more karmas and one becomes karmically lighter and lighter. As that h=
appens, one's clarity regarding one's dharma improves further.
 
Lord Rama =
was born to kill Ravana and going to the forest was key to building up the =
confrontation. Also, many people he had to meet, befriend and take help fro=
m in the main mission of killing Ravana (e.g. Hanuman, Sugriva, Angada etc)=
 were in the forest. He had several other tasks to do in the forest (e.g. r=
elease the curse on Maharshi Gouthama's wife Ahalya). So he had to go to fo=
rest. His guru Vasishtha imparted aatma jnaana to him before marriage and h=
e realized his Self then. As a realized person, he went with the flow of Na=
ture and fulfilled his dharma impassionately. If you learn to kill your ego=
 and desires, Nature will take you where you need to go and show you what y=
ou need to do!
 
At the time of Mahabharata, the evil people to be destroye=
d were not in a forest or in a distant land. They were the cousins, support=
ed by other relatives and gurus. Krishna was to reduce the weight on earth =
with the help of Pandavas and prepare earth for Kali yuga. Thus, Krishna im=
parted Self-realization to Arjuna and made him into a warrior who discharge=
d his duty without an attachment.
 
What would Arjuna have gained by leavin=
g the battlefield and doing Tapas somewhere in a forest? The goal of all sa=
dhana is Self-realization and it came to him under Krishna's upadesa. Also,=
 he fulfilled his dharma without any attachment, as a realized man, and hel=
ped Nature.
 
(2) Though there are formulas for dharma level in a yuga, the=
y are not absolute. The dharma level changes within a yuga also. Within the=
 same yuga, there are phases of relatively more dharma and there are phases=
 of relatively less dharma. When an avatara comes and goes, the dharma leve=
l is restored above the current level, to create a buffer against further e=
rosion of dharma.
 
(3) India is the land of rishis, a land of highly conce=
ntrated spiritual energy. However, many many millions of years back, the ge=
ography of the world may have been different and the whole world may have b=
een one nation. Some Puranic stories are quite likely set in such a world. =
Even in recent millennia, bharatavarsha extended all the way from Afghanist=
an (Gandhara->Kandhar) to Malaysia (Malaya), Thailand, Cambodia (Kambhoja->=
Campuchia->Cambodia) etc.
 
Someone like Jesus Christ may be an avatara. A =
normal person cannot say "surrender to god, confess your sins and take a co=
mmitment to improve. I will then take on your sins." Only an avatara of a d=
eity or a rishi can have such love, compassion, kindness and detachment to =
the suffering of physical body. Moreover, he established a decent level of =
dharmik life in almost half of the world for a couple of millennia. These p=
arts of the world may have been far more adharmik if not for him. This is n=
o mean task. Only an incarnation of a deity or a great rishi can do somethi=
ng like that.
 
Of course, if a deity or a rishi needs to be born outside I=
ndia to fulfil a specific mission, that can happen.
 
Best regards,
Narasim=
ha

  Subject: [ved=
ic-wisdom] Question on Dharma of Lord Sri Ramchandra
        Namaste, 

   =
     There are few questions that are lingering in my mind for quite someti=
me. I hope this is the right forum to discuss about avataras and dharmas re=
stored by these avataras. If not, please ignore my mail and re-direct me (i=
f possible) to a right forum.  

        Question 1: (Lord Ramachandra's dh=
arma)

        Lord Ramachandra has followed the orders of His father and a=
ccepted to go on exile to Vanavasa. 
        Bring a kshatriya, shouldn't H=
e have said to father that His dharma is to rule Ayodhya than spending his =
time in aranyas? 

        (The great warrior Arjuna wanted to take to do T=
apas for he had felt that he is not doing the right thing by killing his ne=
ar and dear ones...but was prevailed over by Lord Krishna on Kshatriya dhar=
ma argument)

        How is it that Lord Ramachandra has fulfilled his dha=
rma by going to forests and Arjuna neglected his dharma by not killing his =
relatives?

        Question 2:

        Whenever dharma is being abused, L=
ord comes over to Bhu Loka and sets things in order. egs...Lord Rama of Tre=
ta Yuga, Lord Krishna of Dwapara yuga and when they leave after performing =
their duties, dharma is set right and they have achieved their objectives. =


        Does that mean that before they depart, the dharma of THAT yuga i=
s restored rather than FULL dharma? e.g, Lord Krishna before departing, res=
tored 2-padas of dwaparaYuga dharma and left, instead of restoring the dhar=
ma completely? Do avataras have to CONSIDER yuga-dharma also when restoring=
 dharma? Can't they restore it COMPLETELY? If so, do Kalki have to restore =
the dharma of Kali-Yuga rather than restoring it completely? 

        Ques=
tion 3:

        Why did avataras have to happen only in Bharatavarsha? 
  =
      Why did they not happen anywhere else in the world? 


        Thanks=
 & Regards,
        --Murahari
