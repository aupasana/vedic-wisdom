Namaste friends,

I agree with Utpal. Sink is the l=
ast option. Things poured in sink mix 
with all kinds of junk.

The best op=
tion is to pour the water at the base of a plant/tree. If 
that is not poss=
ible, pour it in a place where people usually don't 
walk. Pour in sink onl=
y if unavoidable.

Thanks,
Narasimha
