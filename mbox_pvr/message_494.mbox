Namaste Ajit,
 
A really learned and elevated soul like you is asking a foo=
l like me for my view - how weird is the play of the Mother! You read shast=
ras far more thoroughly than me. I read only a little and mostly go by my i=
nstincts, words of gurus and insights from practical experience. Anyway, as=
 you asked, here are my 2 cents.
 
The purpose of sadhana is to instill dis=
cipline and control the mind. If the wandering mind slows down, oneday ther=
e is a possibility of mind stopping completely for a little time. When that=
 happens, you perceive the underlying reality that an overactive mind norma=
lly stops you from perceiving. As this happens more frequently, you are abl=
e to control your mind far better.
 
If you do things in a business-like at=
titude, in haste, IMHO, it is not really conducive to slowing the mind down=
 and creating a useful complete/partial silence of the mind. It is very cou=
nter-productive. Before any ritual, we are expected to do praanaayaama. The=
 idea is that you get as much control over breathing and hence on mind, and=
 then rely on the meditation/japam/homam to take the mind further into calm=
ness.
 
If you are somebody who can maintain calmness of your mind even as =
you rush through some hymns in haste, then I see no problem. But, normally,=
 rushing through something under time pressure destroys the calmness of the=
 mind.
 
On the other hand, if you do not have artificial pressures to meet=
 a count and go calmly as long as you can, it is more conducive to the calm=
ing down of the mind.
 
Thus, I strongly recommend doing japam at the pace =
that is comfortable and not detrimental to the calmness and focus of mind. =
If necessary, I recommend dumping restrictions like meeting a count. In fac=
t, in this age and time, it is probably better to not have a target count a=
t all and have a target time only. In other words, don't say "I will do thi=
s mantra for 1008 times" and instead say "I will do this mantra for 40 minu=
tes". Then, for those 40 minutes, you can focus on the mantra calmly.
 
Of =
course, quantity also matters. Doing japam for 4 hours everyday is definite=
ly better than half hour. But quantity without quality is useless. Very foc=
ussed meditation for half hour is better than distracted meditation for 4 h=
ours. If you can maintain the quality, then quantity starts to matter.
 
Be=
st regards,
Narasimha

edic-wisdom: quality vs quantity


  namaste mahodaya,

  I have a doubt th=
at I've wanted to ask for a while. Please do reply on vedic-wisdom.

  Assu=
ming that one has limited time for japa (or other sadhana), which is better=
 -- doing a 
  smaller count slowly and deliberately, or trying to do the j=
apa very quickly in order to have 
  a higher "count"?

  Since it is navar=
atram, take devi-mahatmyam as an example -- is it better to read a few chap=
ters
  slowly each day, or is it better to try and finish the parayana of a=
ll 700 shlokas at superspeed?

  bhavadIyaH,

        ajit
