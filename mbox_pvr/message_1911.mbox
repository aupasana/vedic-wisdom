Namaste,

No. Manish is not a well-known guru or yogi or something. He is a doctor 
working as a nuclear medicine consultant. He does not have many sishyas. He 
contacted me a few years back with a message, I reluctantly kept in touch, I 
finally started the sadhana he asked me to do, I went through a spiritual 
transformation and slowly understood him better. Several mystical 
experiences, some of which I shared here in the past, made the skeptic in me 
realize some important things about him. But, it is possible that people 
living close to him and interacting with him everyday do not know about his 
spiritual attainment.

He wanted to stay out of limelight, but the command of the Divine Mother on 
spreading homam brought him into indirect limelight. I do not know what the 
Mother wants in future.

There is no literature on him, except some mails in the past on 
vedic-wisdom. In fact, he will laugh if I mention this mail to him.

Best regards,
Narasimha
