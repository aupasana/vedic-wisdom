Namaste,

Thank you for the nice link. I just wanted to share some quick thoughts on 
the orientation of Ganesha's trunk. Trunk turning to left is more common and 
trunk turning to right is rare, as that website notes.

When energy of self-awareness is entering the Pingala nadi (the right/solar 
channel of knowledge and logic), one will feel as though one's body is 
tilted to one's left. When energy of self-awareness is entering the Ida nadi 
(the left/lunar channel of surrender and feeling), one will feel as though 
one's body is tilted to one's right. These are things sadhakas can 
practically observe. My guess is that the orientation of Ganesha's trunk may 
hold clues to the way in which that form is experienced.

For example, the form of Baala (childlike) Ganapathi is experienced through 
the left channel, i.e. pure love and devotion. It works through surrender, 
feeling and an intuitive approach rather than with knowledge, logic and a 
systematic approach. Same with Bhakti (devotion) Ganapathi. But, most forms 
work through the right channel, i.e. knowledge, logic and a systematic 
approach.

Just as Dakshina Kaali is preferred and people are afraid of Vaama Kaali, 
similarly Ganesha with trunk turning to left (i.e. working through dakshina) 
is preferred by people and people are afraid of Ganesha with trunk turning 
to right (i.e. working through vaama). Some people will even tell you to not 
keep a Ganesha idol at home that has trunk turning to right!

Just my 2 cents for tonight...

Best regards,
Narasimha
