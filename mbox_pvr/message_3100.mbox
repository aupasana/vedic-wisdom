Namaste Nagraj garu,

Chimney need not be cleaned that often. It can normally be once every couple 
of years, depending on the use. This is a fireplace-chimney question rather 
than a homam question and the local fireplace people will know better than 
me.

Yes, people use two ladles to represent the male and female elements working 
together. There are several steps and parts in rituals symbolizing different 
things. As the intention was to spread a simple procedure, some things were 
simplified.

If you have a sruk and sruva and know how to use them, please feel free to 
use them. I suggest that others need not worry about this and stick to what 
they are doing now.

Best regards,
Narasimha
