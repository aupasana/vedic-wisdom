Namaste Rajarshi,
=
=C2=A0
Obviously, I cannot comment on each and every Vedic verse. One can c=
onnect to only a few Vedic verses. But you seem to=C2=A0have a knack for as=
king for the right verses which I am able to connect to. This is not that f=
irst verse you asked which I could finally feel comfortable with.
=C2=A0

A=
lso, thanks to Swee Chan for sending a PDF with the text written correctly =
in Sanskrit with the swara marked.
=C2=A0
Here is my own interpretation of =
the verse. Even though this seems quite natural and obvious to me now, afte=
r a little meditation, some scholars may obviously give a different interpr=
etation. For example, the e-book quoted by Rajarshi below has a more worldl=
y interpretation by Pandit Shriram Sharma Acharya, especially for the secon=
d line. Anyway, I will share my take.
=C2=A0

=C2=A0
The ve=
rse:=C2=A0AV 14-1-143 is given below in ITrans notation.
=C2=A0

=C2=A0
Word-wise meaning: yatha=3Dhow, sindhuH=3Docean, nadinaaM=

haa=3Dmighty one, evaa=3Dlike that, tvaM=3Dyou, samraaGYi=3DO Supreme Mothe=
r=C2=A0ruling over all, edhi=3Dgrow and expand, pati=3Dthe supreme Lord's, =
urastaM=3D[from the] heart, paretya=3Dhaving left.
=C2=A0
Meaning: Just as =
the mighty ocean brings forth dominion over rivers, O Supreme Mother ruling=
 over all,=C2=A0you, having=C2=A0left the heart of the supreme Lord, grow a=
nd expand.
=C2=A0
Brief Purport: Water evaporating from the ocean forms clo=
uds. Clouds give rains and that forms rivers. If water does not evaporate f=
rom the ocean, all water will be in the ocean and there will be oneness. Bu=
t because of the separation, there are multiple bodies of water. But rivers=
 do try to unite with the ocean (original source) at some stage or the othe=
r.
=C2=A0
Similarly, when the supreme Mother who is the Shakti (and portray=
ed as the consort) of the supreme Lord is situated in the heart of the supr=
eme Lord, She is in oneness with the Lord. When Purusha and Prakriti are in=
 oneness, there is just Sat-chid-ananda and no division in Brahman and no o=
bjects. But, when Prakriti separates from Purusha, there are multiple objec=
ts. When separated from Purusha, Prakriti gives individual ego-consciousnes=
s and gives rise to the creation, sustenance and destruction of infinite ob=
jects in this universe. This is like water from the ocean forming rivers an=
d other bodies of water. At the end, those objects have to merge in Purusha=
 like waters merge in ocean.
=C2=A0

Narasimha
