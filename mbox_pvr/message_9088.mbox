Dear all,
=C2=A0
Thanks for all your advise. Let me say that looking for a =
job is not an issue that I have only recently had, it has always been there=
. Anytime I need to change my job, it will take me tremendous amount of tim=
e to get one.
=C2=A0
I had a couple of dreams long time ago on this regard =
when I was searching for my last job. It attributed my job issues with Pitr=
u Dosh and someone having done some black magic back when I was still at sc=
hool to prevent family prosperity. I don't know how correct is this, but=C2=
=A0how am I to address something like this using homa? If not homa, how els=
e?
=C2=A0
Additionally, Narasimha Rao Ji, why Ganapathi or Lakshmi homa for=
 wealth? If God is one, shouldn't any homa be able to grant once wish or re=
move once suffering whatever it may be? I have been doing this homa now for=
 4 years. Don't know if I should continue or change it to Ganapathi or Laks=
hmi sadhana...or Kubera sadhana. At this point, I am so tired that I=C2=A0 =
am looking for something that will work without having to wait for another =
4 years and finding out it wasn't the right way. You mentioned once that lo=
wer=C2=A0etheral beings are more easily pleased. In that sense, would Kuber=
a sadhana temporarily be better?
=C2=A0
Thanks,
Bhupendra.

Namaste Sir,I am sor=
ry to know your situation and have no specific advice.If there is a big pil=
e of sand blocking one's path, all I know is that shoveling it away will un=
block the path. I have no idea how long one needs to do it. It depends on h=
ow big the pile is and how big one's shovel is. In other words, the heavine=
ss of the karmas blocking one and the intensity of the remedial measures de=
cide when one breaks through. It may be a day or a decade or whatever.For m=
aterial concerns related to finances, usually worship of Ganapathi or Laksh=
mi is recommended. Homam of Lakshmi with Kanaka Dhara Sotram (composed by A=
di Shankara) is a good option, but I was asked by my guru not to include it=
 in Mahalakshmi homam manual as one of the options. But one can download th=
e stotram from the web and use it. One needs to just add swaahaa at the end=
 of each verse and make offerings.There are billions of really really suffe=
ring human beings (and many many more other
 beings) on this earth. When I =
read news sometimes, my heart gets wrenched. But, unfortunately, there is n=
othing I can do, except praying to Her to give conviction and direction to =
those suffering, so that they can eventually find their way out of their mi=
sery.I hope some divine force will show you the right direction. Doing some=
 sadhana sincerely for a while is a great thing in this age. I hope some be=
