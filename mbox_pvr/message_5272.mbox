Namaste Sir,
 
Thanks for this mail. Now, I understand better where you com=
ing from!
 
> it could only be your imagination that I have any sympathies =
for him
 
Quite possible and my apologies if so.
 
> > > What does the "hig=
hest shakti" do ? Compete with lower shakti ?
> This question was asked bec=
ause you were trying to compare apples with oranges
 
Well, it is more like=
 comparing sweet apples to gross (and yet colorful) worms.
 
All scriptures=
 such as Yoga Vaasishtham and Upanishads tell us that self-realization is t=
he only worthy goal of sadhana and that other abilities, siddhis and attain=
ments are useless and not worth pursuing. As I mentioned earlier, Ramakrish=
na Paramahamsa proposed to give some siddhis to Vivekananda and the latter =
rejected them because they would not help him in realizing god. Siddhis and=
 other abilities that come without a conscious pursuit can be accepted with=
 neither excitement nor regret, but they are not worth pursuing consciously=
.
 
> I don't see any reason, why an afterlife would bring me
> greater tru=
th than where I am now.
 
No, this is not an issue of afterlife. One can do=
 sadhana and realize Self even when alive and then live as a jeevanmukta fl=
owing with divine will.
 
The bottomline is that as long as ego and individ=
ual will are present, one is moved by the force of individual will and stuc=
k in the game of actions and reactions. Once they are effaced, one flows wi=
th divine will and is out of the game of actions and reactions.

First of all, Ravana is NOT an =
example of the attainment of the "highest ideal of Aurobindo".
 
Aurobindo'=
s ideals have been misunderstood by many learned people to mean that he was=
 striving for physical immortality. He sadly ended up attracting some wrong=
 people that way.
 
It is possible to remove the distinction between manife=
sted things and Brahman and view them as non-different. But that state is n=
ot attainable by even great yogis. Moreover, that state is not achieved by =
actively pursuing it.
 
The best course of action for any sadhaka is to ign=
ore the physical form, overcome the fascination for it and its needs, reali=
ze the underlying Self and live as a jeevanmukta like a leaf flowing in win=
d. If one is meant to divinize physical form like Mahavatar Babaji has done=
, divine will will then make one to do so. But, one consciously pursuing it=
 is likely to retain fascination for the physical form, not realize Self an=
d get nowhere.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
