Namaste,

Pournima day is usually good for spiritual practices. It was actually at a 
muhurta suggested by me on a Margasira Pournima (Dattatreya Jayanti) day two 
years back that Ravi and Narayan (who sent mails recently) started homam. 
Both have been doing daily since then.

Dhanurlagna (i.e. around sunrise time) on Jan 10 is a good time. Noon time 
(Aries lagna) is also good.

In addition, for Ganesha, Chaturthi day is also good. Sunrise on Jan 14 is 
good for Ganesha.

Best regards,
Narasimha
