Namaste,
 
It is a bad idea to sleep in a temple or in a place where you do your spiritual sadhana. As one does more and more sadhana, one leaves saattwik energy in the place. Sleeping is a taamasik activity. Whatever little (or more) tamas is in one is brought to the surface when one sleeps. So one leaves some taamasik energy in the place where one sleeps. It is a good idea to not mix up the two. So try not to sleep in a temple or atleast in the pooja room in your own house (unless it is unavoidable).
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

A friend of mine told me that sleeping at temples during nights is prohibited in Hindu sampradayas and also only certain left handed practices mandate worship and pradakshina during midnight. He does not have any substantiation. Are these only local practices or is there any text(s) that deal with this.
