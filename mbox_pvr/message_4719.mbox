Namaste Vinay ji,
 
> It was Swami Vivekananda's greatness and humility

.. God sent Narendra and not sand to Paramhamsa.
 
Agreed. Ramakrishna not =
only came with his own group of people, but said that the same group of peo=
ple would accompany him again. When waiting for Narendra and others to come=
 to him, Ramakrishna used to climb on the roof and bitterly cry for their c=
oming. Thus, what you say is true too, i.e. the disciples Ramakrishna worke=
d with were special. But, what Vivekananda said must also be true and not j=
ust a vain display of humility. After all, he knew Ramakrishna very well.
 =

For example, Krishna moulded Arjuna into a great rajarshi. Obviously, Arju=
na is special and Krishna chose Arjuna for a reason. But, one will not be w=
rong to say that Krishna could've moulded *anyone* into a great rajarshi li=
ke Arjuna, IF he wanted!
 
> Paramhamsas do not complain, because they are =
above

That is actually w=
hat I was trying to get at.

istic problem.
 
I have felt all along that we are on the same page, but se=
eing the page from slightly different perspectives. Hopefully, the differen=
t ways of stating things will benefit the readers and broaden the perspecti=
ve. I have actually thoroughly enjoyed this discussion with you!
 
*       =
 *        *
 
> For me, Guru and Istha Devata are the same. No difference.
=
 
What a powerful statement! Lucky is one who actually feels that way inter=
nally. Reminds me of an experience with my guru.
 
Once my guru was talking=
 to me about the deep faith and belief a couple of people had in him.
 
Whe=
n I heard it, a thought passed through my mind about my not being like them=
. Having a strong logical mind not yet fully tamed, I simply could not thin=
k like what Rajarshi wrote above.
 
My guru said without my saying anything=
, "*You* do not have the same kind of devotion for me Narasimha. I know tha=
t. Magar chakkar yeh hai ki [but the tricky part is that] *I* am devoted to=
 you. So you don't worry".
 
If a worthy sishya is fully devoted to a guru,=
 even an unworthy guru gets transformed into a worthy guru over time. That =
is the power of pure love and faith. If a worthy guru is fully devoted to a=
 sishya, even an unworthy sishya gets transformed into a worthy sishya over=
 time. That is the power of pure love and faith.

I do not like to get personal or judgmental and only made =
a comment in general on his question.
 
Without aiming at any specific pers=
on, I want to say one thing. In general, if anyone without a guru wants to =
make spiritual progress, I suggest turning to Agni (fire) for help.
 
Agni =
is known as paavaka, or the purifier. RigVeda 1.77.1 says about Agni: =E2=
=80=9Cyo martyeShu amartyo R^itaavaa=E2=80=9D. Fire is the imperishable ess=
ence within perishable objects, i.e. immortal essence within mortals, and i=
t is a representation of the divine Will and rhythm (R^itam). This immortal=
 fire devours and purifies perishable objects, qualities and conditioning w=
hich are present within a mortal (and which make one a mortal).
 
We use ex=
ternal symbols to affect internal changes. Just as spending time with a mov=
ie enthusiast can strengthen the movie enthusiast within one and just as sp=
ending time with a religious person can strengthen the religious person wit=
hin one, similarly spending time with fire can strengthen the fire within o=
ne.
 
By slowly reducing perishable objects within one, such as weaknesses =
and other conditioning, to ashes, strengthened internal fire removes obstac=
les and smoothens one's spiritual path. If an external guru is needed, he/s=
he can come when one is prepared enough.
 
Worshipping fire is easy and ver=
y effective for spiritual progress. Many civilizations have benefited from =
it before.
 
It was the Divine Mother's command to my guru to enable a grou=
p of spiritual seekers across the world who worship various deities in fire=
, by teaching a very simple procedure that can be performed regularly. Peop=
le who have never lit a lamp in their life and have not done any rituals ha=
ve learned homam (havan) from the simple manuals at the homam website below=
, are performing homam on a regular basis and are seeing internal transform=
ation. For those without a guru, fire can be a powerful guru. Fire is a liv=
ing representation of god on earth.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
