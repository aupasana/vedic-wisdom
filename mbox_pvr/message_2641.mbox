Namaste,
 
First of all, I want to respectfully remind people that this yahoogroup is meant for discussing spirituality and not meant to be a fan club or an admiration society for anyone.
 
If you like something I write, please try to benefit from it and put it to use.
 
*        *        *
 
Krishnamurthy is correct in a way and also incorrect in a way.
 
Suppose you ask a brilliant swimmer how one can swim, he may say "oh, it's so easy. You jump into the water, just move your hands and legs and there you go. A teacher cannot teach you. You have to jump and discover it yourself". It seems so easy and natural to him, but not for one who cannot swim. If one just jumps into water and starts moving hands and legs, one may even drown!
 
Though a swimming instructor cannot ensure that you learn swimming in a specific time period or that you become an expert in swimming, he can engage in practices that maximize the probability of you learning swimming successfully oneday. He can also stop you from drowning in the beginning.
 
It is true that there is no formula to ensure self-realization in a specific time period. One can look at self-realization as a happy accident that just happens. However, rishis and seers gave many ways and factors that increase the probability of that accident considerably. Guidance from a good guru will also increase the probability of that accident considerably. However, even a good guru cannot ensure realization. One can only maximize its chance.
 
*        *        *
 
Aadi Shankara is so correct and wise in saying that a guru is the tiger in a dream who awakens you from the world of dreams. The tiger may just be a dream object and unreal, but, one would stay in the dream much longer if not for the tiger roaring in the dream!! Similarly, a guru is just imaginary. All that exists is god and the tendency to see different people/obejects (instead of seeing all as god and only god) is like imagining various dream objects. So guru, friend, enemy, wife, son etc are all detailed imaginations of the mind and all that exists is god. However, one will be stuck in this long dream called samsaara (wordly life), if the tiger called guru does not appear and roar. A beautiful and highly meaningful analogy!
 
*        *        *
 
The use of gurus who are pretentious, gurus who have not realized themselves, gurus who have pride, gurus who have selfish agendas and gurus with a bloated sense of self-importance, is very limited. However, please remember that even such gurus can be of immense benefit to *some* people. Everyone has a role to play and that is why Nature has created them!
 
But an ideal sadguru who can really give you a strong push in your spiritual pursuits is one who has no ego, one who does not have a bloated sense of self-importance, one who has no pride, one who identifies with and is guided by the Infinite and one who is fulfilling his/her dharma without any expectations.

Let me ask a similar question:
 
If whatever happens in a dream is not really happening and just being imagined in your mind, why all that imagination? Why not just be dreamless?
 
*That* is not the correct or useful question! If the fact is that you *are* in a dream, a more useful question is: How can I realize that I am in a dream and come out of the dream into a state of wakefulness?
 
*        *        *
 
I briefly described how my relatitonship with my spiritual guru  started in the mail that Utpal mentioned below. During the time Manish was waiting for me to start using the rudraksha mala he sent, he used to call me now and then and talk about spiritual matters. He would sometimes talk about very specific things that I was thinking of just before he called. He would address my question without my asking. A couple of times, I mentioned that to him and said he was answering exactly what I was thinking of, as though he read my mind. He would humbly say, "do you think that I know your thoughts? I have no clue. I am just saying what I feel like saying. Shiva wanted to answer your question and used me as an instrument to answer your question. It is god who does everything. We are mere instruments."
 
Once he said, "my message is *not* that I am special. My message is that *you* are special. My message is that *everyone* is special. I am not here to just experience divinity and go. I am here to show people that it is possible even today and make *thousands* of people experience divinity. I do not want people to become like me. I want to see thousands of people becoming *better than* me."
 
He also said once, "I am not here to show an alternative spiritual path to people. If one is a Krishna devotee, let one remain a Krishna devotee. If one is an aghori, let one remain an aghori. If one is in a religious movement, let one remain in that movement. If one is a Christian, let him remain a Christian. I just want people to realize the essence of religion and spirituality, imbibe it in their thinking and become better in their own chosen path."
 
Already, so much change happened in the 5.5 years since he called me first. I never thought I could be in the state I am today. I never thought the changes in my thinking that happened in the last few years were possible. I never thought so many seemingly normal people would be able to perform a homam regularly. When Manish told me that today's times need a lot of people performing homam regularly and that a lot of people were out there who would start homam and make great progress with 5-6 years of homam, I was not so sure. Manish always knew what to do, was quite confident and did not worry about how and whether it would get done. At the same time, he never lost the attitude of "She is doing and I am just an instrument" and imbibed that attitude in me too!
 
As I said before, the sign of a good guru is that you see transformation within yourself. The sign of a good guru is that you see things getting done that once seemed impossible or very difficult. The sign of a good guru is that you achieve far more than before and yet have far less attachment to (and pride in) what you do.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

Involved in many Astrlogical clashes. that is why it is quite possible that some or many may not understand his spiritual greatness. one thing i can say with 100% confidence that he is no ordinary soul and i am really really blessed to be his shishya! it was a punyodaya in my life when i was inspired to accept him as my guru on a Janmaashtami day. i hope i live up to his expectations and stature. as you rightly said, his writings will inspire the spiritualist of coming generations and i add astrlogers as well.

The energy of the writing is such that one is left speechless and amazed and filled with a deep sense of reverential humity for that great source of  limitless compassion and bliss we call God. A sadguru is indeed God's representative on earth, IMO.
