Namaste,
 
As usual, I am cc'ing my answer to your question anonymously, so=
 that others also benefit.
 
For people who play soccer, knee pads are help=
ful in avoiding knee injuries. But not everyone wearing good knee pads is a=
 good soccer player and one can play soccer well without knee pads also. In=
 95% of the cases, knee pads make no difference. But, in the 5% cases where=
 one falls down, they help one.
 
Similarly, one can do several rituals wit=
hout yajnopavitam also. A yajnopavitam along the spine helps in regulating =
the energy flow. When energy (of self-awareness, aka Kundalini) rises high,=
 one can lose self-awareness. A thread touching upper body, especially alon=
e the spine, grounds one's self-awareness to the body and puts limits on ho=
w fast the energy can rise. However, wearing of a tight upper cloth changes=
 the equation.
 
In general, yajnopavitam makes no difference most of the t=
imes. In a rare case when energy rises too high too suddenly and one is not=
 prepared physically, yajnopavitam can prevent a temporary problem in the n=
ervous system.
 
In my view, it is fine to do tarpana without a yajnopavita=
m and using a cloth as you describe Kaasi priests doing below.
 
However, I=
 suggest wearing a yajnopavita to those who perform homam for spiritual pro=
gress or meditation with any mantra without moving the body much. Such peop=
le may sooner or later experience some movement of energy. Yajnopavitam gro=
unds the energy and regulates its flow. Even if one doing a homam or medita=
tion regularly did not get sacred thread formally, I suggest just getting o=
ne and wearing it by oneself. The tradition of getting a sacred thread at u=
panayanam makes sense if serious sadhana starts with Gayatri mantra from th=
e upanayanam day. If someone without upanayanam done and sacred thread give=
n is doing serious sadhana, it is a good idea to keep a sacred thread on. W=
earing an upper cloth that touches body at some points around the spine are=
a also serves pretty much the same purpose.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

        Dear N=
arasimha garu,

        In the below mail it is mentioned that Yajnopaviita=
m is one of the essential requirements for performing Tarpanam. When I rece=
ntly visited Kaasi, I noticed the priests are tying diagnolly opposite ends=
 of a towel and putting that like a yajnopaviitam for the people who do not=
 have them.

        Is this an absolute must that one should have an yajno=
paviitam or some other arrangement like above for performing Tarpana ?

   =
     Also it would be nice if you can put up some video of Tarpana / Atleas=
t a photo image of holding the darbhas. It is very difficult to hold darbha=
s in such a way that the tips align with the tips of the fingers. I am usin=
g rubber band sometimes.

        Thanks and Best Regards,
        <deleted=

          Dear Friends,
          For general information I would like to =
submit that  Shraddha  is required   to be performed not only  during  Pitr=
 Paksha  but also on the respective anniversary Thithi  in the respective a=
nniversary Paksha and respective   anniversary month of one`s father and mo=
ther,if  they are not alive. In South India, Sraddha is observed as above. =
This is known as Pratyaabdika Sraddham. It calls for  certain voluntary res=
trictions and sacrifices on the part of the  karta and  elaborate rituals w=
ith Homam and offering of  Vastra, Bhojanam ( as per family tradition)  and=
  decent Dakshina  to the Brahmins who officiate as pitr and visvedeva apar=
t from appropriate  Dakshina to the family or other priest who conducts the=
 Shraddha proceedings. Pitr Paksha Sraddha  involves offerings also to Karu=
nika Pitrs  i.e., relatives who died and for whom there were no issues or f=
or whom there is none  willing to perform Shraddha  rites. Pitr Paksha Srad=
dha  is far simpler and less time consuming as compared to annual  Sraddha =
 referred to above. In Pitr Paksha Sraddhas  normally 5  Brahmins  of  whic=
h one has to be a priest are required.  One of the brahmins is nominated as=
  Karunika Pitr.  In place of meals as in  Pratyaabdika Sraddham , in  Pitr=
 Paksha Sraddhams they are offered rice,dal  and some vegetable like raw  p=
lantain and any other thing as per custom. In USA and other offshore lands,=
 very few freelance  priests are available as in India. It is also difficul=
t to get more than one priest at a time, at places where they are available=
, since most of the priests are working for Hindu temples. But the temples =
allow the priest for house visit or for performing rituals in the temple co=
mplex itself. There are prescribed scales of fees for various rituals to be=
 paid to the temple. Over and above this one cay pay any gratis amout to th=
e priest. The list of items to be given as danam  to the priest included mi=
lk, curd,ghee,3 varieties of fruits and 2,3 varieties of vegetables in addi=
tion to those listed above.

          Coming to the question as to what ca=
n be done if one is located at a place where no priests are available, one =
should do at least Pitr tarpanam, if one is accustomed to performing   Tarp=
anams on Amavasya, Sankramanams, Grahana kalams  and all other  Punyakalams=
. Essential requirements for Tarpanam are Yagnopaveetham, Dharbha Grass,Bla=
ck til (2,3 grams) and a rice(2 grams).  If one is not performing these pre=
scribed(ordained ) rites, he needs to seek  kshama from  Pitrus on that day=
 for non-performance  and at the earliest possible occasions contact a Guru=
 or Purohit and seek  advice on remedial actions. It is permissible to perf=
orm  Shraddha  on some other occasion. Pl. consult the  Purohit in this reg=
ard.  My suggestion is at least feed poor people or Brahmins on the day of =
 Shraddha.   Unquestionable faith (shraddha)  is a must in such ceremonies.=
 Do not give Dakshina to priest grudgingly. Have faith and belief that the =
pitrs  get pleased by doing the prescribed rites.
