Namaste,
 
You can put the photo next to the homa kundam and worship the Mother in photo and fire together. Do upto poorvaangam in the manual. Call Mahaganapathi in fire and idol and do pooja to them together. Make a few aahutis for Mahaganapathi in fire. You can also do the same thing with Navagrahas. Then do aavaahanaa in photo/idol and fire together. Do upacharas to them together. Then reach all prayers you normally read, while making offerings in fire. After your pooja is done, you can do uttaraangam from homam manual and poornaahuti. Meditate for a while and then do kshama praarthnaa and "mnatraa heenam" sloka.
 
Nyasas, raatri sooktam etc can be read in "Durga saptashati" published and sold for a very very small fee by "Gita press" - one really saattwik printing press in the religious world today. Aahutis with the moola mantra (om aim hreem kleem..) are offered just before and just after the 700 verses of saptashati. You can do aarati after naivedyam and before uttaraangam and poornaahuti.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
