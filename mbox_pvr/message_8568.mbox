Namaste friends,
=C2=A0
On the sensitive (but practically relevant) issue o=
f women doing spiritual sadhana during monthly periods, I heard opinions & =
justifications that did not make much sense to me. In a private communicati=
on, Sri Svoboda made some points that I liked. I am sharing it with you wit=
h his kind permission.

=C2=A0
Instead of focusing on offending gods or any=
 other beings, as some people do, please note that he focused on the prevai=
ling gunas and also on downward movement of apaana vaayu. Focused sadhana i=
s meant to make apana move up (Kundalini moves up when praana and apaana me=
et) and some physical conditions direct apana heavily downward (e.g. full b=
owels, monthly periods, full bladder).
=C2=A0
Of course, in the end, when o=
ne is dying, one MAY need to focus mind on god and make apana move up, unde=
r equally (if not more) challenging circumstances. But one can make things =
easy and controlled, when still alive and practicing.

=C2=A0
If I may add =
my 2 cents of perspective to the learned opinion below, please keep in mind=
 that some highly taamasik men may be influenced by tamas more than some hi=
ghly saattwik women even in their first day of periods. Things are relative=
. Also, many people (men and women) do most of their sadhana when their apa=
ana is clearly directed downwards and does not move up at all. They do not =
experience anything. Sadhana in such stages is for instilling discipline ra=
ther than making apaana move up and meet with praana.

=C2=A0Best regards,
=

Narasimha

I follow the 3-day rule: th=
e first day of bleeding is ruled by tamas,
and the devi of that day is blac=
k. The second day is ruled by rajas,
and that devi is red; and the third da=
y is ruled by sattva, and that
devi is white. During those first 3 days I b=
elieve it is better for a
woman to be away from everybody except other wome=
n; better for them
not to cook, clean &c; and better for them not to involv=
e
themselves in ritual. After all, when apana is moving downwards
strongly,=
 why disturb vayu by performing some activity like puja &c
that is meant to=
 encourage vayu to move upwards?  
>

>After
that, I think it depends on t=
he woman. Some women are basically
balanced and even if they spot for a day=
 or two more, the bleeding is
effectively ended by the third day. Other wom=
en bleed heavily for
four or five days, during which time apana is clearly =
still moving
downward; in these cases, I think they are better off waiting =
until
the main flow ends.
>
>
>IMO
during this period a woman can still do =
japa & internal
meditation and naama japa, but in an easy, sahaja, saumya f=
ashion; no
kathina prayogas EXCEPT when for certain tantrika rituals, e.g. =
if
the centerpiece of the ritual is to offer menstrual blood, it can be
a b=
ig help to have an actual menstruating woman present, to invoke
that partic=
ular shakti.  
>
>
>Generally
I have found that so long as the woman is suf=
ficiently comfortable to
be able to sit up, that there is no problem for he=
r to sit and watch
someone doing a ritual, except when that ritual is of a =
type where
the very presence of a menstruating woman can disturb the delica=
te
shakti that is being invoked. Sadly, I have found that most of the
peopl=
e who claim that a menstruating woman can disturb them are
people who are n=

often find that =
when I am myself doing homam and a menstruating woman
is sitting at the fir=
e (which I usually permit so long as the woman
understands what she is doin=
g), that the fire often doesn't burn as
well =E2=80=93 this makes sense to =
me, and so I simply adapt to the
situation (e.g. by having plenty of ghee o=
n hand!). Watching homam is
(I have found) generally OK, except that for so=
me sensitive women the
activation of agnitattva heats them up in a way that=
 they can't
