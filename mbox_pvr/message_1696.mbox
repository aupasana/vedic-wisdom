Namaste,

Some people do specific sadhanas for specific days. However, such an 
approach is not very useful. Instead of doing a different 
mantra/sadhana/pooja based on the occasion, do the same thing at every 
opportunity. Whether you pick Mahaganapathi homam or Hare Krishna mantra or 
Chandipath or Vishnu sahasra or a Narasimha mantra or a Shiva mantra, 
whatever it is, do it whenever you get a chance. Whether it is a regular day 
or Shani Amavasya or Akshaya Triteeya or Rishi Panchami or Vaisakha Pournima 
or whatever special day, keep doing the same thing again and again 
tirelessly. That way you will eventually succeed.

Best regards,
Narasimha
