Dear Kris,

The Female element represents the Energy (Shakti). The desires, actions and 
knowledge of each being are caused by the movement of life force within that 
being, which is personified as a Female deity. If there is no energy, there 
is no movement of life force and there is nothing to desire or despise, 
nothing to do or avoid and nothing to know or ignore. We just have the 
singular non-duality and there is no field of duality then. It is the Shakti 
that gives birth (Mother!) to all desires, actions and knowledge and the 
field of apparent duality in which all desires, actions and knowledge 
operate.

*        *        *


Shiva is essentially nirguna Brahman, while Shakti is the energy that causes 
a movement in Brahman and gives birth to a field of duality.

While Brahman (nondual reality) is ONE and only one, the field of duality 
has a lot of variety. The field of duality (also known as "maya" or 
"delusion") has scope for different types of desire, action and knowledge. 
The energies that cause different desires, different actions and different 
aspects of knowledge is personified as different female deities.

You can also trace all those energies to the primordial energy that is the 
root of all energies in Brahman. However, at that stage, we are almost 
beyond names, gunas and depictions.

*        *        *

Even within each person, there are different Energies that cause different 
desires, actions and knowledge. But there is one root energy that causes a 
distinct identity in that person. All other energies stem from that energy.

It is that root energy that creates the entire field of duality in which 
THAT person operates. This energy is the cause of the self-awareness or 
ego-consciousness in that person. This energy (that causes 
ego-consciousness) is also called "Kundalini shakti". Instead of having no 
concept of self and no objectification and being immersed in the non-dual 
Brahman, due to this shakti, one views a part of Brahman as "self" with 
certain attributes, certain vasanas (mental conditioning) etc. This energy 
can either "bind" one to a limited concept of self or "liberate" one with an 
infinite concept of self. In most people, it is the former.

One can view this shakti as a microcosmic representation of the Divine 
Mother within oneself.

Best regards,
Narasimha
