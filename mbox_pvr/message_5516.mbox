Why does turbulence always raise its ugly head in these discussions to pro=
pagate education and wisdom? Is this the nature of the Vedas? Is this the n=
ature of Ahimsa?
Is turbulence a natural element of the Vedic Universe? Ove=
r time, the turbulence of the raw Vedas was smoothed until the Gita was pro=
duced as a useful summary and condensation of the interaction of Man and th=
e eternal essence of the spiritual Universe.

Please cut down on this belligerance. If you keep polluting the =
list with this attitude, I will have to ban you from the list. We welcome a=
ll views, but one can disagree with great scholars and masters without beli=
ttling them or adopting an all-knowing and dismissive attitude.

Aadi Shank=
ara was not anti Veda or anti grammar. In fact, if you study his works, you=
 will be amazed at some of the subtle technical nusances in his commentarie=
s, w.r.t. grammar. In terms of Sanskrit scholarship, scholarship in Vedic s=
criptures, breadth of
 commentaries of Vedic literature and the linguistic =
richness of compositions, Aadi Shankara stands tall among all scholars of K=
ali yuga so far. You cannot take one specific line about the importance of =
devotion out of context and portray the greatest and most prolific scholar =
of Kali yuga in an anti-scholarship light.

* * *

Sanskrit is a very usefu=
l language. So much great literature that shows various paths to reaching g=
od is available in Sanskrit language. Many Sanskrit mantras directly resona=
te with the energy centers in one's subtle consciousness. So, if one wants =
to learn Sanskrit or study various scriptures/classics in Sanskrit, it is a=
 great idea.

At the same time, Shankara's advice of chanting the name of G=
ovinda as grammar and other technicalities do not rescue one in the final m=
oments, is a wise one. Devotion to personal god or *complete* surrender to =
personal or impersonal god is the thing that saves one in the end.
 Learnin=
g various shastras, performing various rituals, disciplining the mind with =
various activities, keeping the company of the saintly - all these are for =
the purpose of increasing devotion and surrender. Depending on one's rinas =
and conditioning, one is bound to engage in various activities, such as lea=
rning Sanskrit, studying scriptures, saying prayers, doing rituals etc. But=
, masters like Shankara remind one of the final goal, so that people do not=
 forget it and get bogged down.

If one wanting to climb a mountain keeps w=
alking around the mountain to find the best path to climb, one may eventual=
ly forget that the goal is to climb the mountain and be stuck at the base f=
orever. Similarly, one who keeps learning this and that forever may forget =
that reaching god is the final goal and get stuck. So compassionate masters=
 may sometimes remind us of the final goal.

* * *

I am reminded of a smal=
l episode from the life of Swami
 Vivekananda.

Swami Vivekananda said at a=
 San Francisco class: "I am the disciple of a man who could not write his o=
wn name, and I am not worthy to undo his shoes. How often have I wished I c=
ould take my intellect and throw it into the Ganges!"

Student said, "But, =
Swami, that is the part of you I like best."

Swami Vivekananda said, "That=
 is because you are a fool, Madam =E2=80=94 like I am."

Vivekananda was na=
med so by Ramakrishna, not because he had viveka (discrimination) arising f=
rom a brilliant logical mind, but because TRUE viveka (discrimination) was =
to arise in his mind later and he was to realize the limitations of his reg=
ular viveka (discrimination of logical mind).

* * *

s celebrated in a relatively few quarters around the world,

r.

Maturity of a teacher is not measured by the
 following. And great teac=
hers do not care about being "celebrated".

In any case, it is not true tha=
t Adi Shankara is not well-celebrated. A significant percentage of Vedanta =
scholarship of the last 2 millennia is influenced heavily by Adi Shankara's=
 commentaries. He shaped the thinking of Indian philosophers for many many =
generations.

Apart from his scholarly works, the mutts established by him =
have shaped the religious consciousness of a significant percentage of Hind=
us in the last couple of millennia.

Any teachings in written/spoken words =
can never be perfect and perish quickly. The words of great great teachers =
also lose their meaning and relevance very quickly. Only the teachings of r=
ishis and gods retain their meaning and their ability to influence the thin=
king of people forever (or for really long periods). Adi Shankara's words -=
 scholarly works as well as composed prayers - have retained their meaning =
and power for more than
 a couple of millennia. The longevity of his works =
is amazing.

* * *

It is ok to have strong opinions. As people's understan=
ding evolves, their opinions evolve too. So, wise ones try not to offend ot=
hers with their strong opinions. In any case, insulting saints, avataras of=
 gods and rishis, based on half-baked understanding of their teachings, is =
not good karma. I request members to be considerate, tolerant and respectfu=
l to others.

Best regards,
Narasimha

 finding that study of Sanskrit and Sanskrit Grammar is keeping me alert an=
d time well spent rather than religious opiates and highs. In fact, I am a =
little upset with the Adi Shankaracarya - snd his Bhajagovindam - If
 he ma=
nifested now before me - and gave his "mUDha mate" stuff - I'll tell him "y=
oung man" go preach elsewhere to your own age group. What you don't know is=
 the vyAkarNa is "vedAnga" - And kids should be "seen and not heard"<br>>=
