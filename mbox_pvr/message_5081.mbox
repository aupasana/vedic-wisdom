Namaste Rajarshi,
 
There are different types of samadhi. Samadhi literally=
 means concentration and focus of awareness. In its normal state, mind is v=
ibrating with too many thoughts and notions. In any state of samadhi, most =
of these thoughts and notions disappear and mind achieves a high degree of =
focus.
 
The focus can be on a physical object perceived through senses (e.=
g. an idol or the physical sound of a mantra) or a subtle object perceived =
by the subtle perception (a deity or the subtle vibration of a mantra). The=
 focus can be on the gross/subtle object or on the act of perceiving the ob=
ject or on the perceiver (all the three exist within one's consciousness as=
 three different things). One's self-awareness can identify with one object=
 and focus its attention on another object ("I am Rajarshi with so and so q=
ualities and I am aware of Bhairava with so and so qualities"). Or, one's s=
elf-awareness can identify with that object ("I am Bhairava with so and so =
qualities"). Please note that all these samadhis are within the field of du=
ality. There is still a sense of "this is I" and "this is the rest", i.e. t=
here is differentiation.
 
*        *        *
 
The next state is what mos=
t people refer to as samadhi. This is a state where mind is absorbed in non=
-dual Self, i.e. without any differentiation. When there are no notions of =
"this is I" and "this is the rest", there are no thoughts, no opposites and=
 there is only Sat-Chid-Ananda (the bliss of just being).
 
*        *     =
   *
 
Now, let me come to what Vimalananda says!
 
The non-dual Self is Sh=
iva (or Purusha or Narayana). The field of duality is Shakti (or Prakriti o=
r Narayani). Though one may normally think that Shiva and Shakti are differ=
ent, are they really different?!
 
Because of our notion that Shiva and Sha=
kti are different, we can either be with Shakti or with Shiva at a time but=
 not with both at the same time. A yogi who has objectification and the sen=
se of "this is I" and "this is the rest" is in the domain of Shakti. When o=
ne overcomes objectification and reaches non-dual samadhi, one is in the do=
main of Shiva. When one leaves that state and one's egosense ("this is I" a=
nd "this is the rest") returns, one will *leave* the domain of Shiva and re=
-enter the field of Shakti. One is prone to be deluded by duality again! Th=
at is what Vimalananda is saying.
 
If one can be with Shiva *and* Shakti a=
t the *same time*, then one is then not enamored or deluded by any aspect o=
f Shakti. When a small aspect of Shakti enamors/deludes one ("this is I", "=
that is beautiful", "that is ugly", "I like that" etc), one is unable to pe=
rceive the entire field of Shakti. This is just like a person tied to a roc=
k in the ocean not being able to swim the entire ocean. When one is not bou=
nd by any object in the field of Shakti and not attracted or repelled by an=
ything, then one can navigate the entire field, i.e. all space-time combina=
tions. This is possible only if one has perfect mastery over Shakti. That c=
omes only when one has zero attachment to anything in the field of Shakti. =
That comes only when one is with Shiva enough and eventually becomes like S=
hiva. If a yogi reaches non-dual samadhi, stays in it for a long time and h=
appens to come back to the field of duality, then one may become like Shiva=
 and work with Shakti with zero attachment and perfect mastery. One is awar=
e of the entire field of duality - all spaces and times - and yet unattache=
d to anything. That is because one perceives the underlying non-dual Self e=
ven as senses perceive various objects of duality.
 
For most people, this =
is out of bounds. One either experiences non-dual samadhi for a short durat=
ion and cannot sustain it longer and comes back to be deluded by duality ag=
ain, or one stays in non-dual samadhi for a long time and does not come bac=
k (like a salt doll that goes to survey the depth of ocean melting in the o=
cean, to borrow words from Ramakrishna Paramahamsa). Exceptions like Ramakr=
ishna Paramahamsa or Sai Baba, who spent enough time in non-dual samadhi an=
d yet came back to live in the world, are so rare in this age.
 
*        *=
        *
 
Let me put this in terms of Kundalini now. When Kundalini is in=
 moolaadhaara, our self-awareness identifies with the physical body and is =
aware of the physical world around us. As Kundalini goes to various places =
in the subtle body (there are thousands of nadis and chakras!), one is awar=
e of various realities that are out there in this universe. For example, on=
e world (realm of awareness) may be reverberating with the sound of a parti=
cular beejaakshara and filled with a particular light and every being in th=
at world may be a small particle in that light reverberating with that soun=
d. Like that, there are many worlds out there (within us) and one can enter=
 a samadhi through any of them, when Kundalini reaches a corresponding plac=
e.
 
When Kundalini reaches sahasrara, one's self-awareness is with Shiva. =
Shakti loses herself to Shiva and there is no objectification that is the h=
allmark of Shakti. If shakti comes back from sahasrara to a lower chakra, o=
ne's self-awareness is again deluded by duality. However, if shakti comes b=
ack from sahasrara to mooladhara *accompanied by* Shiva, then one is aware =
of duality and non-dual Self at the same time. One lives as a liberated sag=
e, using the body as an instrument to fulfil the will of Nature (since ther=
e is no longer any individual will).

Narasimha
