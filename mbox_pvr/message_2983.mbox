Namaste,
 
I am replying to the list while keeping you anonymous.
 
Yes, fa=
sting or eating less is for cleansing the body and mind and removing some b=
lockages in the subtle body.
 
There is a fire called jatharaagni (digestiv=
e fire) in the belly that digests food. There is a fire called bhootaagni (=
existential fire) in the subtle body that burns all impurities in the nadis=
 of the subtle body and enables better flow of life force in the subtle bod=
y, resulting in better self-awareness. This will in turn result in a better=
 state of being physically and mentally.
 
If one has a lot of food to dige=
st in the stomach, all the fire in the body is diverted into jatharaagni. T=
his reduces other kinds of fire, including the fire in the brain that enabl=
es one to understand things and makes one alert. That is why one may feel l=
ess alert after eating. It also reduces bhootaagni of course.
 
If one fast=
s for a long time, no fire is needed for jatharaagni and that fire is event=
ually diverted into bhootaagni and other physical fires. One becomes more a=
lert, some impurities in the subtle body may be burnt and one's subtle self=
-awareness may become clearer.
 
Apart from just fasting, if one meditates =
for a while after fasting, it will be very beneficial. Fasting creates a go=
od situation for meditation. When jatharaagni is reduced and diverted to bh=
ootaagni, subtle body loses some impurities. If one focuses the mind on som=
ething (e.g. a mantra) at such a time, one can experience better flow of li=
fe force in the subtle body.
 
However, please bear in mind that some bodie=
s (e.g. people with excess pitta or vaata) cannot stand a fast physically. =
So, never push yourself.  Push it a little bit, but not to the point of bre=
akage. If complete fasting is not possible, one can attempt partial fasting=
. Minimizing the food and eating limited amounts of saattwik food also redu=
ces digestive fire and facilitates higher levels of bhootaagni.
 
In scient=
ific terms, scientists have discovered that digesting meat takes far more e=
nergy than digesting cooked grains and they have also found that eating foo=
d that takes less energy to digest makes one more alert as it diverts the e=
nergy to brain.
 
One can increase bhootaagni using rituals like homam or b=
y reducing jatharaagni through fasting, limiting food intake or eating saat=
twik food. If one meditates when bhootaagni is burning bright, one burns so=
me blockages in the subtle body (which basically corresponds to some mental=
 conditioning or to some karmas in kaarana sareera).
 
Best regards,
Narasi=
mha

             Dear Narasimha garu,

                Wish you a happy Deepavali!
           =
      
                I have a question on fasting for material benefits (=
i.e. to achieve something / to get rid of malefic effects of planets).
    =
             
                1) Some people say, fasting is doing Tapas wi=
th jataragni. So don't take anything since the fire would be consumed.
    =
            2) Others say, fasting is for cleansing the body and mind and s=
uggest to take as much water as possible.
                 
               =
 Could you tell me which is correct ? 
                 
                Al=
so could you tell me how the desires are fulfilled with fasting. I can unde=
rstand with Japam etc since we are praying to a deity earnestly. But with f=
asting I can't figure out. How are we paying up for our bad karmas with fas=
ting ?
