Dear Sir,
 
> i recently saw the hindi movie-Rudraksh 
> ..what i understan=
d about sanjay dutt in this movie is that he has extra-ordarnery mental cap=
abilities and powers like he can astral travel,get visions,do tele-kinesis,=
time-travel to the past and get desired info he wants...........now i feel =
that there must be some siddh yogi's in india who might be having these ext=
ra-ordarnery mind powers after doing thier extreme tapasaya,secret meditati=
on practices & sadhana's ....i feel most of these genuine siddh yogi's are =
found in high himalayas .. and i feel these siddh yogi's are even today doi=
ng thier meditation practices & sadhana's to sustain these extra-ordarnery =
mind powers called siddhi's........ 
> 
>         Vikrant
 
All that exists=
 is Brahman. Different beings, different points in time/space are like diff=
erent ripples in the ocean of Brahman.
 
One who identifies oneself with a =
ripple on the surface of the ocean only sees things from that perspective. =
One who realizes, not superficially but fully, that one is actually not the=
 ripple but the ocean itself and identifies with the entire ocean sees ever=
ything. A ripple may not see another ripple at a distance, but the ocean it=
self can see all ripples as its own parts.
 
Nothing is impossible for a ma=
n who realizes his true nature.
 
However, one who has realized the true se=
lf may not be interested in making a show of such abilities or in exercisin=
g such abilities or even in looking at them as "abilities". Such a person's=
 attitude may be totally different from that of an un-realized person who j=
ust fancies all those as "abilities" and is curious about them.
 
It is als=
o possible to have some such abilities without being self-realized, but tha=
t is an unwise pursuit.
 
A true jnaani pursues nothing but knowledge of se=
lf. When the knowledge of self comes, knowledge about everything comes as a=
 result. After all, everything we perceive is a limited manifestation of Se=
lf, while Self itself unlimited.
 
On the other hand, one pursuing some spe=
cific thing may succeed in getting it. But it will only bind one further. O=
nly knowledge of Self liberates one.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
