Namaste friends,

I forwarded this mail to a learned author whose guru was =
an adept in 
Tantra and Aghora (please don't ask me for his email address, =
as he 
values his privacy). This is his response.

Yes, I generally agree: Only for a few will sitting in an external 
s=
mashana be beneficial. Better to create an internal smashana in your 
mind,=
 where various types of conditioning and various wants, agendas, 
likes and=
 dislikes are killed and put to rest so as to not rise again. 
Without a go=
od internal smashana, sadhana done in an external smashana 
will not be tha=
t effective. With a good internal smashana, sadhana done 
anywhere can be v=
ery effective.

Sadly, it is usually those with dense conditioning who go t=
o the smashan 
and perform complicated sadhanas & obtain smashana siddhis =
=E2=80=93 and because 
they are still under the control of their conditioni=
ng, the end result 
is usually not very pretty.

Subject: A Word on Smashana Sadhana

Namas=
te friends,

There is a notion in some circles that sadhana done in smashan=
a 
(cemetary) is more powerful than regular sadhana, for creating changes 
=
inside and outside. Most such statements in folklore are neither 
entirely =
incorrect nor fully accurate. One needs the right context and 
perspective =
to understand.

The microcosm inside us reflects the entire universe. By ha=
rnessing the 
ability of consciousness to focus on some things, it may be p=
ossible to 
create changes inside and outside. But what that requires is a =
certain 
state of mind. A densely conditioned mind cannot focus on anything=
. A 
mind that overcame most of its conditioning can focus well and 
accomp=
lish things.

To remove internal conditioning, we engage in various externa=
l practices 
(such as pooja, homam etc). External symbols cause resonance i=
nside and 
modify internal conditioning with time. For example, when we do =
homam, 
external fire resonates with the internal fire (aspect of conscious=
ness 
that burns conditioning) and one progresses.

Similarly, external sma=
shana where bodies are burnt will cause resonance 
inside consciousness and=
 promote an "internal smashana" where 
conditioning dies, burns and disappe=
ars.

Create an internal smashana in your mind, where various types of 
con=
ditioning and various wants, agendas, likes and dislikes are killed 
and pu=
t to rest so as to not rise again. Without a good internal 
smashana, sadha=
na done in an external smashana will not be that 
effective. With a good in=
ternal smashana, sadhana done anywhere will be 
very effective.

Yes, for a=
 few, sitting in an external smashana and seeing the play of 
Nature will b=
e conducive to creating an internal smashana. If so, one 
can go and sit in=
 a smashana. But, if one with dense conditioning goes 
to a smashan and doe=
s a sadhana with high expectations of certain 
results (spiritual or materi=
al), because one read that smashana sadhana 
is powerful for begetting resu=
lts, one may be deluding oneself.

Just my 2 cents, take it or leave it...
=

Best regards,
Narasimha
