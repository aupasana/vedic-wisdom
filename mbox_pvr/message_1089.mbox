Namaste,
 
Yes, Mahaganapathi homam can be performed in the night too. In f=
act, the most pleasant Mahaganapathi homam I have ever attended was perform=
ed in the back yard of a priest's house, right next to a river, on a night.=
 I practically know that it is perfectly fine to do Maha Ganapathi homam in=
 the night and the energy generated is still pleasant and saattwik.
 
Howev=
er, if you do Chandi homam, my advice is to do it in daytime, atleast in th=
e beginning. The energy that manifests is different at night than at daytim=
e, especially with Chandi homam. If you are unable to perceive that energy,=
 then there is no problem and no difference between day and night. But, if =
you are able to perceive that fierce energy and if it scares you, that may =
be bad. Thus, it is better in the beginning to do Chandi homam during the d=
aytime.
 
For Lakshmi homam also, daytime is preferred. But night is also a=
cceptable.
 
Other homas are ok anytime.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

          N=
amaste,

          I am glad to know that. With practice, it will become sm=
ooth and you can 
          start to focus better of mantra.

          Whe=
n priests perform homam on a grand scale, they distribute the tasks among 
=
          them. If you do on a smaller scale by yourself, you can do everyt=
hing by 
          yourself. In fact, the latter is better.

          In f=
act, even when many priests do it together with one fire, it is good to 
  =
        have one person managing the fire and offerings. If one chants, one=
 prepares 
          and chooses offerings and one finally makes the offeri=
ngs in the fire, that 
          is better than everybody making different =
offerings in fire. Ideally, the 
          contact with fire should be from=
 one person. Of course, if each has a 
          separate homa kundam, all =
can make offerings in fire.

          Never think in terms of keeping the =
positive vibrations to yourself or 
          within your house. Fire is th=
e basis of creation. Fire rituals are important 
          to maintain dhar=
ma in this universe and promote creation and sustenance. Do 
          homa=
m thinking that you are doing your dharma and have no other thoughts of 
  =
        motives. Of course, if you do your dharma by helping nature, nature=
 WILL 
          reward you for it. But leave it to nature and do your part=
 selflessly. 
          Self-centeredness is an acid of which a single drop=
 is sufficient to break 
          the milk of your ritual.

          Actu=
ally, a homam done under the sky (i.e. in open air) is better than one 
   =
       done under a roof (i.e. inside a house). However, when one cannot do=
 in open 
          air, one can do inside a house also.

          Best re=
gards,
          Narasimha
