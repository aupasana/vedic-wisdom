Namaste learned friends,
 
Let me give my 2 cents of ramblings on one point=
 made by a friend and some other related spiritual matters. Please bear wit=
h my non-coherence here. I am writing after a long time and want to cover a=
 few different things.
 
Before I forget, one small point. Moon in Taurus a=
nd Sun, Mars and Jupiter in Scorpio will be aspecting each other during Sun=
day-Tuesday. This is a good time for sadhana.
 
*        *        *
 
Befor=
e I go on a rambling spree, I need to address one specific point.

=
 
Let me respectfully state that you have a very limited view on what being=
s are out there and what they are experiencing.
 
If I mentally chant the V=
edic mantra of a planet with perfect swaram for 8 hours continuously, do yo=
u think no beings are affected by it?
 
First of all, even going by materia=
l subjects such as modern science, there are millions or billions of beings=
 (microbodies) within our physical bodies.
 
Secondly, if you go beyond mat=
erial subjects and accept spiritual experience as a pramaana, the entire un=
iverse and all gods are within. Rishis taught that all the worlds, all the =
deities and all the beings exist within one's sushumna nadi. Of course, our=
 sleepy self-awareness is limited to bhooloka (moolaadhaara chakra) and hen=
ce we do not perceive all this normally. But, it is possible to actually ex=
perience that various lokas and devas are within oneself. Unfortunately, it=
 cannot be experienced by everybody, because waking up one's sleepy self-aw=
areness and purifying it is difficult, and hence science will not accept it=
.
 
Whether you accept that the entire universe is within or not, the botto=
mline is that there are so many beings within us. They are affected by our =
thoughts and the chemicals (at the gross level) and energies (at the subtle=
 level) produced by those thoughts.
 
Each thought and action of ours chang=
es the lives of so many beings that are within us! It may be mind-boggling =
to think of this, but it is so true. Vedic mantras are special and chanting=
 them creates specific energy patterns in various energy centers and channe=
ls of the body. So, of course, they have the potential to "remedy some bein=
gs' suffering" (suffering of millions of beings that live within us).
 
Man=
tra involves sound or vibration. This vibration is not just of particles at=
 sthoola sareera (gross) level, but at sookshma sareera and kaarana sareera=
 level also. The vibration produced by the physical sound (vaikhari) coming=
 out of physical mouth (sthoola sareera) is only the gross aspect of the sa=
bda. The subtle vibrations produced by imagery in the mind and thoughts are=
 as important (if not more important). Out of the four divisions of sabda, =
vaikhari is the least important. Madhyama, Pasyanti and Para are increasing=
ly important.
 
When a great maharshi chants a Vedic mantra even a few time=
s, such a harmonious blend of the vibrations is produced at various levels =
(sthoola/sookshma/kaarana/mahaakaarana sareeras) that paraa level of sabda =
is so strong that strong vibrations are created by it in the mahaakaarana s=
areera. Thus, the entire universe can vibrate to the mantra!
 
*        *  =
      *
 
> >I for example chanted certain Navagraha mantra 
> >from mornin=
g to sunset without food, drink and 
> >toilet, compleated the numbers requ=
ired, Nothing happened.
 
If one sowed a seed and a plant did not come, may=
 be one did something wrong. May be one did not put enough water. May be th=
ere wasn't enough sunlight. May be one did not wait enough time. You cannot=
 conclude that this seed does not give a plant.
 
If you read a graha mantr=
a and nothing happened, may be you were imperfect. First of all, try a Vedi=
c mantra. Second of all, try to perfect the intonation. Third of all, try t=
o focus all your conscious and sub-conscious energies on the mantra or deit=
y and produce the correct vibrations at all levels.

If you succeed even 1%=
 in that, Vedic mantras do produce tremendous results. Even a fool like me =
who knows not much has seen the power of these Vedic mantras.
 
Another thi=
ng:
 
The results of properly chanted Vedic mantras may sometimes be someth=
ing you have not expected! She (or He, if you prefer) knows what should be =
given when. We are like small children who don't know what is good for us a=
nd bad for us and She is like the mother of children. Sometimes, a child ma=
y not like what mother gives or does, but mother knows the best.
 
When a s=
mall baby has an upset stomach, mother may forcefully put her finger at the=
 base of the tongue and provoke a vomiting. The child may hate this act, bu=
t this may make his suffering less after one final suffering. Similarly, so=
me properly done Vedic remedies sometimes bring one big trouble (like the v=
omiting) and much relief later. Also, one bad karma may be blocking a lot o=
f good karmas and the planet may have to force the fructification of the ba=
d karma before many good karmas fructify.
 
In fact, whenever I did intense=
 sadhana for navagrahas (especially Mars) using Vedic mantras, there was im=
mediate suffering for a few days before really good results. In fact, I try=
 to not even distinguish between the two and try to consider both as Her bl=
essings. They really are. As astrologers, we keep recommending remedies to =
people who are materially inclined and want temporary relief (so-called) fr=
om temporary troubles (so-called). But, it is also a good idea to increase =
devotion and sthita-pragnyata that makes people not distinguish between ple=
asure and sadness.
 
*        *        *
 
Regarding one supreme God:
 
The=
 potential to manifest (Brahman) is ONE and it fills the entire universe, k=
nown as Brahmanda (anda=3Degg, i.e. potential to manifest). Brahman alone e=
xists, Brahman alone is supreme and Brahman alone is unlimited and beyond a=
ttributes. Each manifestation of Brahman is limited and has attributes (gun=
as etc). Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Indra, Agni, Vaayu etc are all different _l=
imited_ manifestations of Brahman with various attributes. Though they are =
all limied, a rishi can see the unlimited Brahman in all of them.
 
A rishi=
 is capable of _seeing_ that everything that exists is actually Brahman onl=
y. When he worships Vishnu, he actually sees Vishnu not as a limited manife=
station with certain attributes but as Brahman and hence lauds that Vishnu =
is supreme and beyond attributes and that everything and every deity is a d=
ifferent manifestation of Vishnu only. For example, Narayana Sooktam says "=
sa brahma sa shivah sa harih". Similarly, when a rishi worships Ganapathi, =
he actually sees Ganapathi not as a limied manifestation with certain attri=
butes but as Brahman and hence lauds that Ganapathi is supreme and beyond a=
ttributes and that everything and every deity is a different manifestation =
of Ganapathi only. For example, Ganapathi Atharva Seersham says "tvam brahm=
a tvam vishnus-tvam rudras-tvam...".
 
You see similar assertions in Vedic =
literature with respect to various deities. It is not that rishis are lying=
. It is that they are in such exalted state that they see Brahman in whiche=
ver deity they are contemplating. In fact, a rishi in sahaja samadhi state =
can see Brahman in everything.
 
*        *        *
 
That one God who man=
ifestaed differently is the unmanifested supreme potentiality. He/She/It ha=
s no attributes (which come with only a specific manifestation) and normall=
y known as Brahman. When the final goal of a journey has no description, on=
e may describe it based on the path taken in the journey. Similarly, those =
who worshipped Vishnu and finally reached Brahman through Vishnu describe B=
rahman as Narayana and attribute some of Vishnu's gunas to Brahman, though =
Brahman has no gunas. Those who worshipped Shiva and finally reached Brahma=
n through Shiva describe Brahman as Sadashiva and attribute some of Shiva's=
 gunas to Brahman though Brahman has no gunas.
 
All the fights about the s=
uperiority of deities that occurred in the past are meaningless. Brahman is=
 ONE and Brahman alone is. Whether you reach Brahman through Vishnu or Shiv=
a or whoever, Brahman you reach is identical. So worship whichever deity yo=
u are attracted to. Try to reach Him/Her. If you are so inclined and believ=
e in the One source of all divinity (Brahman), try to reach Brahman through=
 whichever deity you worship. The paths are many, but the final goal is the=
 same. Ekam sat vipraa bahudhaa vadanti.
 
All religions and spiritual path=
s offer valid paths to Brahman. Allah is not different from Brahman, but th=
e path taught by some Islamic teachers to Allah may be different from some =
paths Hindus know to Brahman.
 
The advantage of aarsha dharma is that rish=
is have experimented and given some easy paths. If you don't want it easy a=
nd want to take a difficult path also, that is fine and good in a way. But,=
 if you want an easy path, try to follow rishis and use some Vedic mantras.=

 
*        *        *
 
I have recently uploaded Mahaganapathi Homam audio=
 and a 25-page manual on my webpage (link below). This is a simple procedur=
e that takes less than an hour and do-able on a daily or weekly basis. I do=
 a one-hour homam everyday and can tell you based on my own experience that=
 a daily homam is great for spiritual sadhana. When bhootaagni burning in s=
ookshma sareera is weak, nadis have impurities and energy flow has obstruct=
ions, then most other sadhanas you may be doing will not yield much result.=
 Homam as a sadhana is a very effective in increasing bhootaagni, purifying=
 nadis and removing obstructions to energy flow. If one is already a realiz=
ed soul like Buddha, homam may be unnecessary. But, for the confused souls =
of Kali Yuga, it is a very effective method. Just like with any sadhana, re=
gularity increases effect in homam too. I encourage people interested in th=
e Vedic path to make a small homam (one hour or half hour or atleast 15 min=
) a part of their daily spiritual sadhana. After doing it for a few months,=
 you will realize that it will make all your other sadhanas (such as japam)=
 much more effective.
 
Those of you who are more learned must forgive me i=
f you find mistakes in what I am teaching. Instead of teaching a complicate=
d procedure that turns people off, I believe in simplifying it so that peop=
le benefit from it. Moreover, I have retained most important steps and this=
 is an almost authentic Vedic agnimukham.
 
Some people believe that Vedic =
agnimukham based homas cannot be performed by everybody and hence recommend=
 Tantrik homas. I am inspired by Saint Gnyaanadeva, who asserted that each =
being has the right to recite Veda and made a buffalo recite Veda in front =
of arrogant scholars who forbade him from reciting Veda. I like the Vedic m=
ethod and hence teach it to every interested person. May those who disagree=
 with me ignore me.
 
*        *        *
 
I will be off from the lists ag=
ain. BTW, I am not reading any of these yahoogroups. If you need my attenti=
on, please send a private mail. But, unfortunately, I am getting only 10 mi=
n everyday to read and reply to mails and I get a lot of mails. My sincere =
apologies if I am unable to help you. Please don't take offense. Even if I =
cannot help you directly, I will be praying to Mother to somehow give direc=
tion to everybody who sought direction from me and failed to get a response=
 from me.
 
May the light of Brahman shine within,
Narasimha

great for spiritu=
al sadhana. When bhootaagni burning in sookshma sareera is 
weak, nadis hav=
e impurities and energy flow has obstructions, then most other 
sadhanas yo=

homam may=
 be unnecessary. But, for the confused souls of Kali Yuga, it is a very 
ef=
fective method. Just like with any sadhana, regularity increases effect in =

homam too. I encourage people interested in the Vedic path to make a small=
 homam

ion, <BR>> etc.  These 
jivas are described in the <BR>> Bhagava=
d-gita as "Devas," and are definitely 
a <BR>> distinction that God, Sri=
 Krsna makes <BR>> Himself.  Do you 
recall the verse from <BR>>=
 Bhagavad-gita, "Devan deva-yajo yanti, mad bhakta 
<BR>> yanti mam api,=
" or "Those who worship the devas <BR>> (demigods) go 
to the planets of=
 the demigods <BR>> (after death), whereas those who worship 
Me, come <=
BR>> to Me."? So the concept of God and demigod <BR>> (almighty, 
and=
 His empowered parts and parcels) <BR>> is not something of a cult 
thin=
king, but rather <BR>> that of the Lord Himself.  But you know this=
, 
<BR>> don't you, and am I not preaching to the choir here?<BR>> <B=
R>> 
So far as many names of God, yes there are <BR>> infinite names,=
 and these 
are mentioned in <BR>> various scriptures to describe but a =
minute <BR>> 
fraction of His immense potencies and Lilas.  Why <BR=
>> is the awareness 
of various names of God <BR>> indicative of man'=
s weakness?  Further, in 
ISKCON <BR>> the infinite names of God as=
 described in various <BR>> 
scriptures are known, recited, and worshipp=
ed, <BR>> yet indeed the 
distinction between God and <BR>> demigod i=
s taught as well.  Where did 
you get the <BR>> idea that ISKCON de=
votees only knew or worshipped one or 
two names of God?<BR>> <BR>> &=
gt;Why do you hate ISKCON? I have heard one 
elder <BR>> >sadhu telli=
ng that God sends you to be born in <BR>> 
>the lands of those you fi=
ght against, in the <BR>> >religion of those 
you hate, in the houses=
 of <BR>> >those who have a debt to repay to you!!! 
I am <BR>> &g=
t;sure you don't want to be reborn as an ISKCON <BR>> 
>member nor as=
 a buddhist. So my humble <BR>> >submission is that you 
should love =
ISKCON and <BR>> >love Buddhists, then you can stay away from 
them f=
orever!!!<BR>> <BR>> If I had the chance to take birth a million 
tim=
es <BR>> as a member of ISKCON, I would think myself as <BR>> the mos=
t 
fortunate person, as ISKCON was the <BR>> creation of His Divine Grac=
e A.C. 
Bhaktivedanta <BR>> Swami Prabhupada, perhaps the greatest saint=
 to <BR>> 
walk the face of the earth in the 20th <BR>> century. =
; Believe me when I 
say this:  had he not <BR>> come with his tire=
less effort to implant 
Sanatana <BR>> dharma and Vedic knowledge within=
 the minds of <BR>> all 
those outside of India, then it is doubtful <BR=
>> that anyone outside of 
India would even have <BR>> heard of the V=
edas, what to speak of 
Jyotish.  So <BR>> far as the misgivings or=
 transgressions of some 
<BR>> of my godbrothers are concerned, each and=
 every <BR>> one of them 
will be accountable for the results <BR>> o=
f their actions.  Those who 
follow the teachings <BR>> of the Gaud=
iya Vaishnava parampara strictly, will 
<BR>> attain the highest moksa, =
and there is no doubt <BR>> about 
this.  So instead of elaborating=
 on the <BR>> sins of some fallen 
disciples, and making this <BR>> t=
he epitaph of the society called ISKCON, 
maybe <BR>> spend a little tim=
e to learn the history of the <BR>> great 
good that the ISKCON devotees=
 did in the <BR>> period during Prabhupada's 
existence on this earth.<B=
R>> <BR>> But I agree that Silva, the gentleman 
who started <BR>>=
 this thread, wreaks with a bit of hate, wouldn't <BR>> 
you agree? =
; In that regard the message of oneness <BR>> and acceptance 
is a very =
good and healing one.<BR>> <BR>> My best to you,<BR>> With
