Not quite.

Within the wakeful state, dreaming state and deep sleep state, there are 
further divisions and distinctions. The above state of nirvikalpa samadhi is 
a higher state within the sushupti (deep sleep) state.

Even after being immersed in nirguna Brahman without objectification for a 
few hours, a sankalpa can come suddenly and one can come back to the field 
of duality and perceive duality again. This means a return to the 
wakeful/dreaming state. Only when one starts perceiving all objects in the 
field of duality without a sense of objectification and starts to see all as 
nirguna Brahman, does one remain established in Brahman for ever.

If one can remain in that state for ever, then one is in Turiya. Once one 
reaches Turiya, one does not go back to the other three states anymore.

Turiya permeates the other three states. One in Turiya may *appear* to be 
awake or asleep or dreaming. He may appear to be experiencing or interacting 
with the objects of the field of duality. But one in reality sees all as 
Brahman at all times. If one can reach that state and stay in that state for 
ever, then and only then is one in Turiya.

Best regards,
Narasimha
