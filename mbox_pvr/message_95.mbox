Namaste Kris,

The modification of Nirguna Brahman (formless Self) to create a field of 
duality is Shakti. All further modifications in that field of duality to 
create various forms is also Shakti only, in Her various aspects.

The ego-mind or consciousness that experiences various objects in the field 
of duality is an aspect of Shakti. However, it is Nirguna Brahman too, just 
as everything else in the field of duality in reality is. So it is both!

When the consciousness is in the state of Shakti (or modified Brahman), it 
experiences various dual objects in the field of duality and is aware of 
"self" also as an object in the same field.

When the consciousness is in the state of unmodified nirguna Brahman, it is 
no longer aware of self as an object in the field of duality. It no longer 
experiences any objects in the field of duality. There is no longer any 
objectification and it no longer experiences a field of duality at all.

After switching between the two states, the consciousness may reach a 
different state. In this state, consciousness is in the state of Shakti and 
unmodified nirguna Brahman at the same time. The consciousness experiences 
various objects in the field of duality and interacts with them. Yet, it is 
firmly rooted in the understanding that all those objects and their field of 
duality are actually modifications of nirguna Brahman only.

This is a very very tough state to reach. Of course, even the state of 
nirguna Brahman (second state mentioned above) is tough to reach, but the 
third one is tougher.

*        *        *

Rishis do not denounce Maya ("field of duality" which is the basis of all 
"experience"). The very word Maya is translated as "delusion", which has a 
negative connotation. In fact, there is no perfect equivalent of that word 
in English.

While some may look down upon Maya, a rishi does not dismiss Maya and does 
not talk about "overcoming" Maya! A rishi talks about realizing that Maya is 
just a modification of nirguna Brahman. A rishi looks to reach the third 
state I mentioned above. Thus, one can operate in the field of duality 
without losing the understanding of the underlying nondual Self. Such a 
person does not give up action in the field of duality and acts and 
interacts with the objects of that field (and yet free from reactions to 
those actions and the bondage caused).

Just as a bird flies with two wings, such a person flies with the dual wings 
of knowledge and action. Neither knowledge is compromised nor action (in the 
field of duality) is sacrificed.

Vasishtha taught the same to Rama in "Yoga Vaasishtham". Krishna taught the 
same to Arjuna in "BhagavadGita".

If "action" is sacrificed or "Maya" is trivialized/denounced and the second 
state mentioned above is over-emphasized, the order in this dual world will 
be disturbed. That perhaps happened to some degree in the last couple of 
millennia.

*        *        *

I realize that this discussion may be difficult to follow for some. After 
all, it is not easy the express the essence of "Yoga Vaasishtham" in a few 
emails, though I tried like a fool. Please ignore this email then and 
instead read Yoga Vaasishtham and Upanishats.

Experience is more important than scholarship or theoretical discussions. 
Certain things are only experienced and not learnt by reading or hearing. 
Yoga Vaasishtham is one rare book reading which can actually take a prepared 
person close to experiencing, but most books are not like that. Thus, 
spiritual sadhana is far more important than typing and reading emails like 
this. Satsang (good company) and discussions with learned people may help if 
one is also doing some sadhana. But sadhana is the key.

Best regards,
Narasimha
