Namaste Sir,
=A0
I am glad to know this.
=A0
> I did not deserve the experi=
ence ...did not have any qualifications.
=A0
Nobody gets something without =
deserving it. However, it is quite useful to continue thinking like this.
=
=A0
Kundalini is a container for one's ego. When grosser elements of one's =
ego are overcome, Kundalini may become awakened and rise. But, that throws =
up new (and bigger) challenges. Some subtler aspects of one's ego may becom=
e so inflated that it may become very difficult to overcome them! Any infla=
tion of ego will eventually block Kundalini from rising further and meeting=
 the Lord.
=A0
This is why I keep emphasizing that experiences are not to b=
e chased. As one becomes internally pure, an experience may come by itself.=
 Though it may be triggered by environmental factors such as place/time/com=
pany, it comes essentially due to one's own purity. However, a tangible exp=
erience or a Kundalini awakening is only the beginning. One needs to exerci=
se a lot of self-control to not let it sidetrack one in the long run and to=
 keep making progress.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=
=A0
A few days back, I had the privilege of meeting a very learned sishya o=
f a great master. He said that he sought experiences when young, but realiz=
ed later that one is better off without them. An experience when one is not=
 completely capable of digesting it can cause ego inflation that can be ver=
y difficult to overcome. One is better off doing one's dharma, paying off o=
ne's rinas and increasing one's detachment in actions.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Until one has real Kundalini awakening,=
 one with a desire for Kundalini awakening may mistaken various other thing=
s for it. But, WHEN (IF) one has a real Kundalini awakening, one will have =
no doubts and know what it is. It will be a highly tangible and clear event=
. A jolt of 20,000 volts of physical electricity as you say. When prana and=
 apana come together for the first time, it will be an explosion like a hyd=
rogen bomb. It will be unmistakable.
=A0
However, one cannot replicate it b=
y just thinking about it or imagining it, just as one cannot get a plant by=
 planting the plastic replica of a seed. If one does sadhana and increases =
internal purity, it will eventually happen. There is no short cut.
=A0
BTW,=
 any members experiencing Kundalini awakening need to take care of their ph=
ysical health for a few months after that. Though it is basically an event =
in the subtle body, it affects physical body too. The equilibrium of the ne=
rvous system may be shaken. While new equilibrium is established, it is ver=
y very useful to stick to sattwik diet.

Swami Sathasivom was in greater Boston two years back=
 and did 1,000 Chandi homas during a 3-month period. He was basically doing=
 one homam after another throughout the day and then sleeping. He did like =
that for about 3 months! The sankalpa was impersonal and for establishing d=
harma in the world. After that exercise, he got a sankalpa to establish 12 =
temples in US where people can come and worship. The one in Santa Clara tha=
t you visited is one of them. He spent some time there in the past, doing s=
adhana.
=A0
If any of you have the opportunity to meet him when he visits t=
he temple again, do try to meet him. He is such a simple, childlike and pur=
e sadhaka. He is quite service-minded, humble and devoted. Priests like him=
 are so rare now-a-days. If you meet him, you will understand what I mean.
=
=A0
BTW, he asked me several months back to visit this Santa Clara temple a=
t my convenience and do a Satya Narayana pooja there. Hopefully, that can h=
appen soon and I can meet a few of you living in that area, Mother willing.=

=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha
