Namaste,

Kavacha means protective sheath/coat. Kavachas of various deities (or 
planets) are protective sheaths covering one's consciousness and 
stopping harmful influences.

Grahas (literal meaning: those who grasp or get hold of) give good and 
bad results by grasping one's consciousness and affecting it.

Each planet has positives and negatives, in general and also based on 
the chart. If one chants the kavacha of a planet many times, eventually 
a protective sheath is formed around one's consciousness with the nature 
and energy of that planet. This will obviously offer protection that is 
consistent with the nature of that planet, in general and in one's 
chart. But, please remember that reading the kavacha of any planet will 
NOT harm you. Even the kavacha of 8th lord or 6th lord will not harm 
one.

Suppose one has Pi lagna. If he chants Sukra kavacha, Venus will protect 
one from loss of courage (3rd), problems to shoulders (3rd), untimely 
death (i.e. loss of longevity/8th), problems in anus/genital area (8th) 
etc. There may be other things based on other factors like aspects, 
occupancy etc. Based on his inherent nature, Venus may also protect in 
the matters of love, romance, creativity etc also. Bottomline is that 
the aspects of one's personality that the planet is conducive to will be 
protected by the planet's energy.

If you pick a wrong planet, you may not get the desired result, but no 
harm is done. Even bad planets in your chart will have some aspects they 
want to protect and doing their kavacha will protect those aspects.

Best will be to chant the kavachas of lagna lord, dispositor of lagna 
lord, Moon's dispositor and Sun's dispositor. Even better will be to 
chant the kavachas of devatas instead of planets. Out of all the 
kavachas I have seen until now, Narayana kavacha (from SrimadBhagavatam) 
and Chandi Kavacha are the most potent kavachas.

But please note that chanting a kavacha once or twice or even once or 
twice a day is hardly sufficient. If one has enough purity already, most 
mantras work right away. But most of us have very dense conditioning and 
the energy of mantras gets dispersed. The energy of the planet/deity of 
the kavacha we chant cannot form a sheath around us easily. It requires 
intense sadhana for most people. If one chants a kavacha 10-30 times 
everyday and does it for 40-60 days, then some kind of results can be 
expected. Intense sadhana with any mantra is needed for most people to 
see some results. Getting things done by a professional priest is also 
not that useful, as there are very very few priests with the required 
purity, the ability to identify with your problem and the ability to 
transfer the energy. For most people, the best solution is to learn and 
chant by themselves.

Best regards,
Narasimha

Namaste all,

I sincerely hope our moderator forgives this question which I also 
posted on the jyotish forum...I am a bit unclear about Kavacha for the 
planets.

For example, if a planet such as Rahu is giving one to have problems 
during his dasha, would one recite the Kavach of Rahu, OR some other 
"counter-balancing" planet that was strong in one's chart?

Thanks!

Raj
