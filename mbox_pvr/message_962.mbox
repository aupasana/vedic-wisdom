Dear Sundeep,

As you eloquently say, =
"if mantra is to have ANY enlightening effect, mantra 
must resonate in the=
 mind itself". You are correct that "we are no longer 
talking about physic=
al energy (sound), we are talking of non-material mental 
energy - the ment=
al equivalent of sound in the mind".

Mind is the connection between what y=
ou called external universe and what 
you called the deeper non-material un=
iverse. Mind has access to ALL realms 
of experience, but it normally focus=
es on the physical/material realm. 
Though mind can theretically be focused=
 on ANY realm of experience through 
effort, it is not easy.

Let me give a=
 small analogy.

If Brahman is like the ocean bed, supreme cosmic being (wh=
o thinks all that 
all of us think, who desires all that all of us desire, =
who knows all that 
all of us know, and who does all that all of us do) is =
like the bottommost 
layer of ocean. Various deities are like intermediate =
layers. Various 
objects of the external material world that are perceived =
by our senses are 
like the ripples on the surface of the ocean. Objects on=
 the surface 
perceive other objects on the surface around them. One's body=
 and the senses 
attached to it are an object on the surface in the analogy=
. When one's mind 
identifies "self" with that body and its senses, it perc=
eives objects as 
perceived by those senses. When one successfully detaches=
 mind from that 
self-identity and identifies with another object in the oc=
ean in a different 
layer, one may perceive a different reality. An example=
 was in yesterday's 
mail on mystical experiences.

Just as the ocean is va=
st and deep and has infinite objects at infinite 
depths, this universe has=
 infinite possible self-identities. As one's 
self-awareness is focused on =
a specific object, one has specific 
experience/percepti on of self and "ot=
hers". When self-awareness changes to a 
different object, one has a differ=
ent experience/percepti on of self and 
"others". However, this is theoreti=
cal discussion for most people, as they 
cannot imagine self-awareness chan=
ging. The self-awareness of most people is 
focused on their body with its =
senses and their experience/percepti on of 
self is the body and "others" i=
s various objects as perceived through the 
senses attached to that body. B=
ut, it IS possible for one's self-awareness 
to go from an object on the oc=
ean surface in the analogy to a layer in the 
mdidle of the ocean or even a=
 bottommost layer.

Repetition of a mantra is only a tool for calming down =
the mental activity 
that keeps feeding this self-awareness. Mind is identi=
fying with a physical 
object made with gross matter (body). By keeping it =
busy with a particular 
repetitive activity, you have a chance of cutting o=
ff its identification 
with that object. As an analogy, suppose a kid saw a=
 rope right next to him 
and thought it was a snake and was scared. You may=
 tell him no, but still 
the thought "snake is next to me" will keep scarin=
g him. If you keep him 
busy with an activity that he immerses in, the thou=
ght of snake next to him 
may vanish from his mind slowly.

Once the identi=
fication of mind with the body is cut off or weakened, mind 
will have to i=
dentify with something else. Imagine a frog clinging to a rock 
on an ocean=
 surface. If it is afraid of slipping and holds on the rock 
tightly, its t=
houghts are on the rock always. If the frog stops thinking 
about rock and =
becomes absorbed in some other thoughts, it may slip from the 
rock. If it =
starts sinking in the ocean, it will get hold of something else 
on the way=
 to the ocean bed (otherwise, it will drop all the way to the 
ocean bed. T=
hough that is not a bad thing at all, the frog is afraid of it 
and instinc=
tively grabs something on the way!!). Like in that analogy, mind 
will get =
a hold of another object (on the way to ocean bed, i.e. Brahman) 
and devel=
op another self-awareness, i.e. a perception of "I" and "others". 
In the e=
xample from last night, the perception of "I" was not the body, but 
a tiny=
 particle in a tremendous wave of energy that reverberated with the 
sound =
of a beejaakshara. The perception of "others" was millions of 
particles of=
 the same wave of energy engaged in making the same sound and 
aborbed in t=
he same sound.

Let me come back to what you wrote: "if mantra is to have A=
NY enlightening 
effect, mantra must resonate in the mind itself. ... We ar=
e no longer 
talking about physical energy (sound), we are talking of non-m=
aterial mental 
energy - the mental equivalent of sound in the mind."

Mind=
 or individualized consciousness is just a window to the universe. If a 
ro=
om has window on the east, you see what is on the east. If a room has 
wind=
ow on the west, you see what is on the west. And so on. The sound of the 
m=
antra IS resonating somewhere (actually, everywhere) in the universe. A 
mi=
nd with a strong self-identification with a body is bombarded by the sense =

inputs of that body, just as a room with an open window on the south is 
f=
illed with cold wind blowing from the south and bombarded by the 
floodligh=
ts installed outside on the south. You have to close that window 
and open =
window elsewhere to get something else. If self-identification with 
body i=
s weakened, the bombardment of sense inputs weakens and the window of 
mind=
 can open to the mantra that resonates in the universe.

When I said earlie=
r that a vaccum should be created in the mind for the 
mantra and the deity=
 to fill, this is what I was referring to.

* * *

Different objects of the=
 universe, including human beings and deities, are 
made up of gross/subtle=
 matters of different gunas. Each object of the 
universe has different per=
ceptions of "I" and "others". Each object of the 
universe has different en=
ergies, i.e. different abilities to affect 
interactions between "I" and "o=
thers".

The energy of an object is the energy that brought that object int=
o being. 
Deities are objects with tremendous energy. But one cannot get cl=
ose to a 
deity unless one overcomes attachment to individualized ego and i=
ts 
potential energy. One needs to convert that potential energy into kinet=
ic 
energy that helps one break away from that ego and approach a deity.

I=
n the long run, none of those objects is permanent. None of those energies =

is permanent. In terms of the previous ocean analogy, one may cling on to =
an 
object on the way to the ocean bed temporarily, but the final goal is t=
o not 
view any object as "I" and not consider any energy as "mine". The fi=
nal goal 
is to drop down all the way to the ocean bed and stay there, with=
out any 
sense of "I" and "others" or "energy".

* * *

Please realize two =
fundamental things:

(1) The energy of the mantra is experienced *after* th=
e sadhana is fruitful 
and one overcomes ego. The mantra is an indirect too=
l for overcoming ego. If 
one thinks that he is doing a powerful mantra and=
 its energy will free him 
from ego, one is mistakened. One MUST put in con=
scious effort with constant 
contemplation to weed out ego and pride to mak=
e one's sadhana fruitful. 
Mantra does not replace that need. Instead, it w=
orks hands in hand with that 
and depends on that.

(2) When one succeeds i=
n overcoming ego and experiencing a mantra, one 
should not think that "I d=
id it" or "I created that energy in my mind". One 
does not do anything (ot=
her than *undoing* what one did previously, viz 
putting together of a comp=
lex and weird self-identity called a body with so 
many things attached to =
it and so many pre-conceived notions about the 
world). The energy of the m=
antra IS already there and resonating everywhere. 
When mind experiences th=
at energy and fills with it, it is simply *tuning* 
to something pre-existi=
ng and not really creating something or doing 
something. It is like a radi=
o tuning to a different channel and one 
listening to newer and better musi=
c or a driver driving on a different 
scenic road and viewing beautiful and=
 better scenery.

* * *

> If all repetitive chanting were equal, mantra sh=
astra would be
> 1/2 a page of text, not more.

I never said they were equa=
l. Perfect absorption into different mantras 
fills the mind with different=
 kinds of enegies (associated with different 
deities). So there is a lot o=
f difference to chronicle. In terms of my ocean 
analogy, the possible expe=
riences when one is absorbed into a mantra are as 
vast as an ocean.

But, =
the essence is this: Mind has to be perfectlty absorbed into the mantra 
an=
d a vacuum has to be created in the mind for the mantra and its deity to 
f=
ill. Other factors related to the specific details in each mantra are 
seco=
ndary. I want to de-emphasize all other things and emphasize this 
essentia=
l thing, i.e. control over ego.

One wanting to drive a car on various road=
s needs a detailed book giving all 
the maps. But my point is that one shou=
ld first learn driving. What makes 
one an expert driver going to various p=
laces is not possession of thousand 
maps but the basic driving skill. One =
not knowing driving will crash the car 
even if he possesses thousand maps.=
 One good at driving may manage without 
maps too. People emphasize complic=
ated, mystified and nuanced knowledge and 
forget the basic essence.

* * *=


I want to categorically state that the nuances of mantra shastra are neit=
her 
necessary nor sufficient for one to achieve spiritual progress. One ma=
y 
spend decades learning the nuances and yet not achieve anything.

If the=
 basic essence is paid attention to, one can achieve despite not 
knowing t=
he nuances. In fact, the nuances may come naturally to one who gets 
some m=
astery over the essential factors.

The proof of the pudding is in eating i=
t. Choose any mantra or beejaakshara 
and meditate on it silently everyday,=
 for 2 hours (atleast one hour). Sit 
comfortably with the back, neck and h=
ead erect, eyes closed and mind as calm 
as possible. Avoid all physical mo=
vement and remain as still as you can. If 
you have an urge to move, suppre=
ss it as long as you can and keep pushing 
the limit everyday. Try your bes=
t to focus the mind on mantra. Do this 
meditation sitting in the same plac=
e, facing the same direction and at 
around the same time everyday. Do this=
 for one year and see for yourself if 
it does something to you or not, des=
pite not paying attention to the 
technicalities and nuances!

* * *

Some =
nuances are not irrelevant completely. But they are irrelevant to most 
peo=
ple. For example, people religiously mention beeja, shakti and keelaka of 
=
the mantra and do detailed anga nyaasa and kara nyaasa. Those are all 
rele=
vant only to a person of a high level of self-awareness, which is not 
the =
case with most people.

Let me give an analogy. There may be some nuances r=
elated to how to lift the 
foot up and land the foot while running, to maxi=
mize the speed. They are 
irrelevant to a small baby who cannot yet walk an=
d only crawls. When the 
baby learns how to walk and later how to run, thos=
e details will most likely 
come to him naturally. Evem without them, one w=
ill run fine, perhaps a 
little
slower. Thus, there is no point in trying t=
o learn the nuances of running 
when one is still crawling. In fact, unneed=
ed focus on those nuances of 
running may even make one's learning of walki=
ng very slow - it is a 
distraction!

* * *

I answered whatever questions =
I could answer and felt like answering.

What we need today is not people w=
ho can discuss theory in detail and have 
an intellectual understanding of =
things. In fact, these things are beyond 
intellectual comprehension. Pract=
ical sadhana is far more important. Do not 
wait till you get technicalitie=
s correct. Just start sadhana as I mentioned 
earlier and commit 1-2 hours =
of your time everyday and see what happens.

What sanatana dharma and Vedic=
 wisdom need today is a handful of sadhakas 
who *experience* mantras at th=
e highest level and yet remain free from pride 
and ego and become purified=
 instruments of the Mother to carry out Her will 
with actions of far-reach=
ing consequences without a trace of ego in those 
actions. This is possible=
 not by learning technicalities and nuances, but by 
developing devotion, s=
urrender and conscious effort with constant 
contemplation.

Best regards,

<DIV>Dear Sun=
deep,<BR><BR>As you eloquently say, "if mantra is to have ANY enlightening =
effect, mantra <BR>must resonate in the mind itself". You are correct that =
"we are no longer <BR>talking about physical energy (sound), we are talking=
 of non-material mental <BR>energy - the mental equivalent of sound in the =
mind".<BR><BR>Mind is the connection between what you called external unive=
rse and what <BR>you called the deeper non-material universe. Mind has acce=
ss to ALL realms <BR>of experience, but it normally focuses on the physical=
/material realm. <BR>Though mind can theretically be focused on ANY realm o=
f experience through <BR>effort, it is not easy.<BR><BR>Let me give a small=
 analogy.<BR><BR>If Brahman is like the ocean bed, supreme cosmic being (wh=
o thinks all that <BR>all of us think, who desires all that all of us desir=
e, who knows all that <BR>all of us know, and who does all that all of us d=
o) is like the bottommost <BR>layer of ocean. Various
 deities are like int=
ermediate layers. Various <BR>objects of the external material world that a=
re perceived by our senses are <BR>like the ripples on the surface of the o=
cean. Objects on the surface <BR>perceive other objects on the surface arou=
nd them. One's body and the senses <BR>attached to it are an object on the =
surface in the analogy. When one's mind <BR>identifies "self" with that bod=
y and its senses, it perceives objects as <BR>perceived by those senses. Wh=
en one successfully detaches mind from that <BR>self-identity and identifie=
s with another object in the ocean in a different <BR>layer, one may percei=
ve a different reality. An example was in yesterday's <BR>mail on mystical =
experiences.<BR><BR>Just as the ocean is vast and deep and has infinite obj=
ects at infinite <BR>depths, this universe has infinite possible self-ident=
ities. As one's <BR>self-awareness is focused on a specific object, one has=
 specific <BR>experience/percepti on of self
 and "others". When self-aware=
ness changes to a <BR>different object, one has a different experience/perc=
epti on of self and <BR>"others". However, this is theoretical discussion f=
or most people, as they <BR>cannot imagine self-awareness changing. The sel=
f-awareness of most people is <BR>focused on their body with its senses and=
 their experience/percepti on of <BR>self is the body and "others" is vario=
us objects as perceived through the <BR>senses attached to that body. But, =
it IS possible for one's self-awareness <BR>to go from an object on the oce=
an surface in the analogy to a layer in the <BR>mdidle of the ocean or even=
 a bottommost layer.<BR><BR>Repetition of a mantra is only a tool for calmi=
ng down the mental activity <BR>that keeps feeding this self-awareness. Min=
d is identifying with a physical <BR>object made with gross matter (body). =
By keeping it busy with a particular <BR>repetitive activity, you have a ch=
ance of cutting off its identification
 <BR>with that object. As an analogy=
, suppose a kid saw a rope right next to him <BR>and thought it was a snake=
 and was scared. You may tell him no, but still <BR>the thought "snake is n=
ext to me" will keep scaring him. If you keep him <BR>busy with an activity=
 that he immerses in, the thought of snake next to him <BR>may vanish from =
his mind slowly.<BR><BR>Once the identification of mind with the body is cu=
t off or weakened, mind <BR>will have to identify with something else. Imag=
ine a frog clinging to a rock <BR>on an ocean surface. If it is afraid of s=
lipping and holds on the rock <BR>tightly, its thoughts are on the rock alw=
ays. If the frog stops thinking <BR>about rock and becomes absorbed in some=
 other thoughts, it may slip from the <BR>rock. If it starts sinking in the=
 ocean, it will get hold of something else <BR>on the way to the ocean bed =
(otherwise, it will drop all the way to the <BR>ocean bed. Though that is n=
ot a bad thing at all, the frog
 is afraid of it <BR>and instinctively grab=
s something on the way!!). Like in that analogy, mind <BR>will get a hold o=
f another object (on the way to ocean bed, i.e. Brahman) <BR>and develop an=
other self-awareness, i.e. a perception of "I" and "others". <BR>In the exa=
mple from last night, the perception of "I" was not the body, but <BR>a tin=
y particle in a tremendous wave of energy that reverberated with the <BR>so=
und of a beejaakshara. The perception of "others" was millions of <BR>parti=
cles of the same wave of energy engaged in making the same sound and <BR>ab=
orbed in the same sound.<BR><BR>Let me come back to what you wrote: "if man=
tra is to have ANY enlightening <BR>effect, mantra must resonate in the min=
d itself. ... We are no longer <BR>talking about physical energy (sound), w=
e are talking of non-material mental <BR>energy - the mental equivalent of =
sound in the mind."<BR><BR>Mind or individualized consciousness is just a w=
indow to the universe. If
 a <BR>room has window on the east, you see what =
is on the east. If a room has <BR>window on the west, you see what is on th=
e west. And so on. The sound of the <BR>mantra IS resonating somewhere (act=
ually, everywhere) in the universe. A <BR>mind with a strong self-identific=
ation with a body is bombarded by the sense <BR>inputs of that body, just a=
s a room with an open window on the south is <BR>filled with cold wind blow=
ing from the south and bombarded by the <BR>floodlights installed outside o=
n the south. You have to close that window <BR>and open window elsewhere to=
 get something else. If self-identification with <BR>body is weakened, the =
bombardment of sense inputs weakens and the window of <BR>mind can open to =
the mantra that resonates in the universe.<BR><BR>When I said earlier that =
a vaccum should be created in the mind for the <BR>mantra and the deity to =
fill, this is what I was referring to.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Different object=
s of the universe,
 including human beings and deities, are <BR>made up of =
gross/subtle matters of different gunas. Each object of the <BR>universe ha=
s different perceptions of "I" and "others". Each object of the <BR>univers=
e has different energies, i.e. different abilities to affect <BR>interactio=
ns between "I" and "others".<BR><BR>The energy of an object is the energy t=
hat brought that object into being. <BR>Deities are objects with tremendous=
 energy. But one cannot get close to a <BR>deity unless one overcomes attac=
hment to individualized ego and its <BR>potential energy. One needs to conv=
ert that potential energy into kinetic <BR>energy that helps one break away=
 from that ego and approach a deity.<BR><BR>In the long run, none of those =
objects is permanent. None of those energies <BR>is permanent. In terms of =
the previous ocean analogy, one may cling on to an <BR>object on the way to=
 the ocean bed temporarily, but the final goal is to not <BR>view any objec=
t as "I" and
 not consider any energy as "mine". The final goal <BR>is to d=
rop down all the way to the ocean bed and stay there, without any <BR>sense=
 of "I" and "others" or "energy".<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Please realize two fu=
ndamental things:<BR><BR>(1) The energy of the mantra is experienced *after=
* the sadhana is fruitful <BR>and one overcomes ego. The mantra is an indir=
ect tool for overcoming ego. If <BR>one thinks that he is doing a powerful =
mantra and its energy will free him <BR>from ego, one is mistakened. One MU=
ST put in conscious effort with constant <BR>contemplation to weed out ego =
and pride to make one's sadhana fruitful. <BR>Mantra does not replace that =
need. Instead, it works hands in hand with that <BR>and depends on that.<BR=
><BR>(2) When one succeeds in overcoming ego and experiencing a mantra, one=
 <BR>should not think that "I did it" or "I created that energy in my mind"=
. One <BR>does not do anything (other than *undoing* what one did previousl=
y, viz
 <BR>putting together of a complex and weird self-identity called a =
body with so <BR>many things attached to it and so many pre-conceived notio=
ns about the <BR>world). The energy of the mantra IS already there and reso=
nating everywhere. <BR>When mind experiences that energy and fills with it,=
 it is simply *tuning* <BR>to something pre-existing and not really creatin=
g something or doing <BR>something. It is like a radio tuning to a differen=
t channel and one <BR>listening to newer and better music or a driver drivi=
ng on a different <BR>scenic road and viewing beautiful and better scenery.=
<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>> If all repetitive chanting were equal, mantra sha=
stra would be<BR>> 1/2 a page of text, not more.<BR><BR>I never said the=
y were equal. Perfect absorption into different mantras <BR>fills the mind =
with different kinds of enegies (associated with different <BR>deities). So=
 there is a lot of difference to chronicle. In terms of my ocean
 <BR>analo=
gy, the possible experiences when one is absorbed into a mantra are as <BR>=
vast as an ocean.<BR><BR>But, the essence is this: Mind has to be perfectlt=
y absorbed into the mantra <BR>and a vacuum has to be created in the mind f=
or the mantra and its deity to <BR>fill. Other factors related to the speci=
fic details in each mantra are <BR>secondary. I want to de-emphasize all ot=
her things and emphasize this <BR>essential thing, i.e. control over ego.<B=
R><BR>One wanting to drive a car on various roads needs a detailed book giv=
ing all <BR>the maps. But my point is that one should first learn driving. =
What makes <BR>one an expert driver going to various places is not possessi=
on of thousand <BR>maps but the basic driving skill. One not knowing drivin=
g will crash the car <BR>even if he possesses thousand maps. One good at dr=
iving may manage without <BR>maps too. People emphasize complicated, mystif=
ied and nuanced knowledge and <BR>forget the basic
 essence.<BR><BR>* * *<B=
R><BR>I want to categorically state that the nuances of mantra shastra are =
neither <BR>necessary nor sufficient for one to achieve spiritual progress.=
 One may <BR>spend decades learning the nuances and yet not achieve anythin=
g.<BR><BR>If the basic essence is paid attention to, one can achieve despit=
e not <BR>knowing the nuances. In fact, the nuances may come naturally to o=
ne who gets <BR>some mastery over the essential factors.<BR><BR>The proof o=
f the pudding is in eating it. Choose any mantra or beejaakshara <BR>and me=
ditate on it silently everyday, for 2 hours (atleast one hour). Sit <BR>com=
fortably with the back, neck and head erect, eyes closed and mind as calm <=
BR>as possible. Avoid all physical movement and remain as still as you can.=
 If <BR>you have an urge to move, suppress it as long as you can and keep p=
ushing <BR>the limit everyday. Try your best to focus the mind on mantra. D=
o this <BR>meditation sitting in the same
 place, facing the same direction=
 and at <BR>around the same time everyday. Do this for one year and see for=
 yourself if <BR>it does something to you or not, despite not paying attent=
ion to the <BR>technicalities and nuances!<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Some nuances=
 are not irrelevant completely. But they are irrelevant to most <BR>people.=
 For example, people religiously mention beeja, shakti and keelaka of <BR>t=
he mantra and do detailed anga nyaasa and kara nyaasa. Those are all <BR>re=
levant only to a person of a high level of self-awareness, which is not <BR=
>the case with most people.<BR><BR>Let me give an analogy. There may be som=
e nuances related to how to lift the <BR>foot up and land the foot while ru=
nning, to maximize the speed. They are <BR>irrelevant to a small baby who c=
annot yet walk and only crawls. When the <BR>baby learns how to walk and la=
ter how to run, those details will most likely <BR>come to him naturally. E=
vem without them, one will run
 fine, perhaps a <BR>little<BR>slower. Thus,=
 there is no point in trying to learn the nuances of running <BR>when one i=
s still crawling. In fact, unneeded focus on those nuances of <BR>running m=
ay even make one's learning of walking very slow - it is a <BR>distraction!=
<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>I answered whatever questions I could answer and felt =
like answering.<BR><BR>What we need today is not people who can discuss the=
ory in detail and have <BR>an intellectual understanding of things. In fact=
, these things are beyond <BR>intellectual comprehension. Practical sadhana=
 is far more important. Do not <BR>wait till you get technicalities correct=
. Just start sadhana as I mentioned <BR>earlier and commit 1-2 hours of you=
r time everyday and see what happens.<BR><BR>What sanatana dharma and Vedic=
 wisdom need today is a handful of sadhakas <BR>who *experience* mantras at=
 the highest level and yet remain free from pride <BR>and ego and become pu=
rified instruments of
 the Mother to carry out Her will <BR>with actions of=
 far-reaching consequences without a trace of ego in those <BR>actions. Thi=
s is possible not by learning technicalities and nuances, but by <BR>develo=
ping devotion, surrender and conscious effort with constant <BR>contemplati=
on.<BR><BR>Best regards,<BR>Narasimha<BR>------------ --------- --------- -=

 more than appease the<BR>> atheistic scientific mind, one that is unwil=
ling to consider (let<BR>> alone accept) the non-material part of the un=

 above concerns.<BR>> Please bear with me in reading the following parag=
raph in its<BR>> entirety before replying - I know I am not presenting n=
ew<BR>> information to you, but merely presenting things as I know them,=
 so<BR>> you may reply/correct my thinking as appropriate: More<BR>> =
specifically, when I read Vivekacudamani, I am
 led to believe that<BR>>=
 the manifested universe is all and only the quintuplicated tattwas.<BR>>=
; The gross human being is no different (i.e. is also quintuplicated<BR>>=
; tattwas), but his consciousness is the link to a deeper non-material<BR>&=
gt; universe. In that deeper universe, which is the source of the<BR>> m=
aterial universe, there is the subtle body, which has, among other<BR>> =
things, the antahakarana, which has the<BR>> reflecting/consider ing/the=
orizing mind that we are all so familiar<BR>> with. It experiences the q=
uintuplicated universe, yet is directly<BR>> part of the unquintuplicate=
d universe! At an even deeper level, even<BR>> this subtle body is a man=
ifestation of the causal body - mahat,<BR>> which consists of the three =
gunas. The manifesting/ enlivening agent,<BR>> so to speak, is the non-d=
ual Brahman, or pure undifferentiated<BR>> consciousness.<BR>><BR>>=
; Now, in the above scheme of things,
 how do mantra and diety figure?<BR>&=
gt; Spoken/chanted/ heard mantra is nothing more than an "energic"<BR>> =
activity of the most external part of the universe i.e. the<BR>> quintup=
licated tattwa universe. Clearly this energic activity by<BR>> itself, *=
if* limited to the quintuplicated universe, is useless. So,<BR>> clearly=
, we must accept that if mantra is to have ANY enlightening<BR>> effect,=
 mantra must resonate in the mind itself, which is part of<BR>> the anta=
hakarana. Right? Now, since mind itself is NON-material,<BR>> what does =
resonate mean at the mind level? We are no longer talking<BR>> about phy=
sical energy (sound), we are talking of non-material mental<BR>> energy =
- the mental equivalent of sound in the mind.<BR>><BR>> It is this no=
n-material mental energy that I wish to understand when<BR>> I ask about=
 mantras and beejaksharas. What is this energy? Is it<BR>> tattwa, prana=
, chitta, ahamkara, manas,
 karma, what? Why do specific<BR>> harmonics =
of it correspond to specific dieties? What exactly *is* a<BR>> diety in =
