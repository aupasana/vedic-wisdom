Namaste,
 
The verse you are talking about is:
 
"shatamaanam bhavati shata=
ayuH puruShaH shatendriyaH aayuShyevendriye pratitiShThati"
 
This is norma=
lly used by priests and scholars to give blessings to people. This is norma=
lly thought to mean "live for hundred years", because of the presence of th=
e terms "shata" (hundred) and "aayu" (longevity).
 
As I see it, it means: =
"The count is by hundreds (many). Purusha (supreme cosmic being) exists as =
the living essence of hundreds of (many) beings. Purusha exists as the bodi=
ly prowess of hundreds (many). Purusha is established in the vital essence =
of beings just as in the bodily vigor."
 
It is saying that the subtle esse=
nce of beings as well as physical powers including senses etc are both aspe=
cts of the same supreme cosmic being!
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
