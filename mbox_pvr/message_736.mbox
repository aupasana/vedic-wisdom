Dear Utpal,

Pride of vidya maya (the illusion of knowledge) is far better than pride of 
avidya maya (the illusion of ignorance). One who learns vedas, upanishad and 
vedangas and is proud of one's knowledge and one who engages in rituals and 
is proud of one's rituals, are better than many people who are in utter 
ignorance and yet proud of this or that. However, my point is that both are 
far away from realization.

True knowledge is one that makes one lose pride. True knowledge is one that 
increases the surrender. True knowledge is one that does not bind further, 
but liberates one.

As you correctly pointed out, recognizing the problem of pride is the first 
step in improving. As you said, pride does not leave one even during 
spiritual sadhana! One may be proud of one's sadhana, even without fully 
realizing it consciously. One does not have to dig deep. One needs to only 
scratch the surface of one's mind, thoughts and instincts to see the lion of 
ego alive, kicking and roaring.

As long as one recognizes the problem and *consciously* tries to take the 
"sarvam krishaarpanamastu" statement at the end of rituals seriously and 
literally, one is on the right path and one will eventually overcome.

Manish keeps telling me, "Narasimha, do not underestimate anyone. Each being 
in this universe has a birth right to liberation. If She wishes, a split 
second is enough to liberate one. Do not have any bias. There is a divine 
spark in *everyone*. Try to light that spark in people. Leave the rest to 
Her." Every person has a potential. Just some conscious effort is needed to 
fulfil that potential.

First recognize pride and ego in your actions, thoughts and instincts. Then 
make a conscious effort to overcome it.

Best regards,
Narasimha
