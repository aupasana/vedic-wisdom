Namaste,

Mahasudarshana homam is good, but please remember that Mahasudars=
ana is a personification of Vishnu's weapon. I recommend preferring normal =
devatas to astra devatas (deities who personify weapons).
=C2=A0
Devatas li=
ke Mahasudarshana and Pratyangira are personifications of weapons. Their sa=
dhanas are akin to taking a weapon and using it. When one takes a weapon, o=
ne can either do a ceremonial pooja to it and put it back or actually use i=
t to solve problems. Though homas and poojas to astra devatas were akin to =
the latter in old days, they are akin to the former now-a-days. In the old =
days, detached sadhakas of a high caliber existed in the priest class and t=
hey used to do homas and poojas to astra devatas like Mahasudarsana and Pra=
tyangira and produced results quickly. Though most priests of today are onl=
y capable of doing an aayudha pooja rather than using the aayudha, they nev=
ertheless instinctively go for these poojas based on the old habits. Howeve=
r, based on the changed capabilities, one should change the strategy.

Just=
 as a son who is troubled by bullies at school is better off complaining to=
 mother or father and let them take care of the problem, instead of taking =
the weapon of mother or father and trying to use it oneself, my humble opin=
ion is that worship of deities who hold those weapons is better today than =
worship of deities personifying weapons, to solve serious problems.

For co=
untering black magic, I suggest doing Rahu-Ketu homam or Chandi homam or Na=
rasimha homam. Narasimha homam with "ugram veeram" mantra may be a good ide=
a. For removing black magic, homam or worship of Dattatreya is also a good =
idea.

If you want the specific material result of removing black magic, ma=
intain physical purity around you when you do homam. Offer black sesame see=
ds in homam. If you have a pomegranate tree near you, offering pomegranate =
flowers in homam is a good idea. Put a full lime (green) everyday as poorna=
ahuti and make sure it burns fully by putting enough fuel (wood/coconut/ghe=
e) along with it. You may need to offer more ghee a few times as poornaahut=
i burnas, to make it burn fully. Also, in the sankalpa of the homam, you ma=
y add "maamuddishya kR^itebhyaH abhicaaraadi prayogebhyo bhaavita pIDaayaaH=
 upashamanaarthaM" (in ITrans transliteration) after "so and so devataa pra=
saada siddhyartham" that appears in the Sankalpa in the manuals.

Best rega=
rds,
Narasimha

      Which homam works best for getting rid of black magic=
?  I wish to call a temple priest but I am confused between Maha sudarshan,=
Chandi and Mahakali.  Within a span of two months if I ask the priest to pe=

 I am doing Ganpati homam with great devotion but still I see =
very little difference in life. Obviously my path to sprituality is much to=
ugher than others. So what rules shall I specially need to follow for resul=

As I have chronic health issues my meditation is not effic=

Hence the question always comes in my mind are my prayers working?



I can=

 only think of minting money. People coming in this forum are genuine and h=
