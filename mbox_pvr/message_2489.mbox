Namaste Krishna Kanth,
 
Suppose god really came to your place in a human f=
orm and asked you to give him some nice food. Will you allow someone who co=
oks terribly to cook? Why  not allow him to "serve god"?
 
It is not just a=
bout "serving god", but serving god *well*. A purified servant of god serve=
s god with single-minded focus and devotion and has no other thoughts in mi=
nd when serving god. A more normal person may think various things in mind =
even when serving god. There is some self-centeredness and ego even in serv=
ing god.
 
The god in your homam fire is not an external god, but your own =
internal god. Through your mental focus, you are projecting the limited man=
ifestation of god inside you into fire and honing your ability to focus the=
 mind on that god. I want to clarify one thing here. Though there is actual=
ly infinite divinity inside you, your pre-occupation with so many other thi=
ngs limits (or zeroes) the divinity that your mind can focus on, access and=
 perceive. By focusing on it more and more, you grow it. Fire is a good med=
ium to project it for focusing better. On practice, the divinity inside you=
 that you can focus on and perceive grows with time. Thus, remember that wh=
at is in fire is the limited manifestation of god inside you that you are a=
ble to focus, acces and perceive. This limited divinity should be nurtured =
slowly and allowed to grow, rather than used up for unnecessary things. Whe=
n this divinity grows and becomes infinite, all your desires and other thou=
ghts will vanish and you will be able to single-mindedly focus on that divi=
nity. Some precautions will help you in the journey.
 
Karmas and thoughts =
of people who are making offerings in your homam fire are basically being r=
eceived in your internal god. If he has enough power (his power is, after a=
ll, the power of *your own* focus!) to grant a specific desire of someone, =
he may just do it. But that makes him weaker and who knows whether the desi=
re was worthwhile?!
 
Of course, when you are offering things in fire, you =
yourself may have some unnecessary desires which may slow down the spiritua=
l progress. But, that is a necessary evil and there is no escape. But, why =
let someone else's desires cause an extra slow down?
 
Thus, this is not a =
matter of political correctness and being nice.
 
However, there is already=
 a lot of karmic intermixing between people very closely connected to one k=
armically, like wife, children and parents. Wife's desires may affect husba=
nd's desires and mother's desires may affect son's desires already (atleast=
 in a closely bonded and old-fashioned families). So there is no significan=
t drawback to allowing them to share fire.
 
Bottomline:
 
If some people a=
re so close to you that you want to allow their karmas and their desires to=
 affect your spiritual progress and slow you down, then allow such people t=
o offer in your homam fire. Even if you do not allow specifically, some clo=
se people's karmas and desires may already be directly affecting your own k=
armas and desires and hence slowing you down!
 
Usually, that would be imme=
diate family, but you know your situation better.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha=

 best and disastrous at worst.
> >

, identify it with your own internal fire (bhootaagni) that burns in the su=
btle body. If you do this for a while, a strong bond is indeed formed. With=
out your knowledge, the internal fire will become strong and burn various v=
aasanas.
