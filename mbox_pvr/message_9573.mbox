Namaste madam,
=A0
I personally did not stop.
=A0
Vishnu's energy sustains =
the entire universe. If planets are moving in their orbits, if electrons ar=
e moving in their orbits, if cells in the bodies of all beings are being no=
urished, all of that is due to Vishnu's energy. Though we like to imagine h=
im as a person like you and me, who needs to sleep, He can actually be awak=
e and asleep at the same time, be present in Vaikuntha and be present in ea=
ch cell, molecule, atom and sub-atomic particle, at the same time. The onmi=
present and omni-sustainer Lord is always present, "awake" and accessible t=
o devotees.
=A0
However, if one is uncomfortable with doing homam during ch=
aturmas, one may stop. In my judgment, however, there is no need to stop.
=
=A0
Best regards,

Narasimha

First of all I want to thank you for putting=

I started doing Krishna H=

My question to you is=
 that I read in some purans that we should not do homam during Chaturmas pe=

<br>
Do you also stop doing daily/weekly homam during these 4 m=

<br>
What is your recommendation?<br>

Thanks so much for gu=
