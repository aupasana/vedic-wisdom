Namaste,
 
One can be the best judge of when one can move to a different homam from the Ganapathi homam. If you have love and attachment for a deity and have a deep desire to worship that deity, move on to that deity.
 
1. That's ok. The mantra at the end "mantra heenam.." is for this purpose only. As long as you do not intentionally mispronounce and you do the best job you can, you are fine.
 
2. You need not start over, but just continue.
 
3. Well, do the best you can and leave it to Her at the end.
 
4. Yes to both a and b. But it is a good idea to make a few offerings (atleast 12) with the moola mantra. After 700 verses are done, offer the moola mantra in fire a few times with ghee. It is ok to do it directly without any nyasas again.
 
*        *        *
 
In this context, I want to state one thing. Not every person needs to do Chandi homam. Chandi is the fierce warrior goddess, who destroys weaknesses in sadhakas and takes them to realization fast. As the world is on an important inflection point and as dharma needs to increase, worship of Chandi in fire by several good sadhakas is needed in the world today (and it is slowly happening).
 
However, for balance, we need good sadhakas worshipping other deities in fire too. For example, Ganapathi homam is a very important one. Vishnu Sahasra Naama Homam is another important one for dharma and peace in the world and I am afraid not many are doing that one. Instead of thinking of Chandi homam alone, I suggest that people should perform homam to a deity that they feel love and attraction to.
 
*        *        *

You can say "vaushat" after "kleem om".

> The CHandi Path book that I have doesn't have dhyanam in the beginning of the chapters is it ok. Also dhyanam is followed soon after nyasa. When you say read the nyasa should we include the dhynam also.
 
That's ok. One custom is to take each chapter as a prayer to a different form of the Mother. Another custom is to take the three charitras to be prayers to different parts of the Mother and use a dhyaana sloka for each charitra. Another custom is to take the entire saptashati to be a prayer to the Mother and use a dhyaana at the beginning for praana pratisthaa alone.
 
> I want to read the kshama prarthna where can I include it. 
 
You can do it before "mantra heenam kriyaa heenam bhaktiheenam hutaashana" verse.
