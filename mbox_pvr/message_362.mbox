When people say=
 what is in Veda and what is not, honestly I can only laugh. They are only =
fooling themselves. Reciting Veda with perfect swara or mastering a celebra=
ted commentary does not help one understand Veda. In fact, understanding ea=
ch single verse in Veda requires great tapascharya. Understanding a verse i=
n Veda is neither possible with energy flowing in Ida nadi (intuition) nor =
in Pingala nadi (logic and analysis). It is possible only with energy flowi=
ng in Sushumna nadi. It is possible with neither intuition nor logic, but o=
nly with *revelation* and simply, for the lack of a better expression, dire=
ct knowledge.
=C2=A0
When one meditates long enough on a verse, the verse m=
ay simply be revealed to the yogi. THAT is the only way to understand a Ved=
ic verse. For most people, it is not possible to decipher even a single ver=
se in an entire life, let alone a passage.
=C2=A0
Bottomoline is: Almost no=
body understands Veda today. What are considered "pure vaidika rituals" are=
 merely another variety of rituals created by someone at some point of time=
. From the point of view of authenticity as granted by Veda, there is no di=
fference between them and other aagamic rituals, though people ignorantly b=
elieve otherwise.

=C2=A0
A simple analogy may help =
clarify a lot of things related to this complicated issue a little. What th=
e thing in the analogy represents is shown here and there in square bracket=
s [].
=C2=A0
Once there were many people who lived near the sea [Brahman/Aa=
tman] . They regularly sat by the sea and enjoyed the sight and=C2=A0sound =
of the sea [experienced Brahman]. They described the sea in some nice crypt=
ic poems [Veda].
=C2=A0
As people started living a little away from the sea=
 [less spiritually evolved], someone had to put together some instructions =
on how to reach the sea. He said, "keep walking towards east" and the instr=
uctions grew with time. People faithfully followed the instructions [ritual=
s].
=C2=A0
People started moving further and further inland and started liv=
ing in a landlocked desert far away from the sea. This generation had never=
 seen a pool of water like a lake, let alone a sea. They faithfully perform=
ed the ritual of walking towards east, but did not find sea. They debated e=
ndlessly whether one had to walk one mile or two miles or three miles and f=
ormed different schools of thought. Some walked their chosen distance, foun=
d a tree or a building or some interesting object=C2=A0and even became sati=
sfied that that was sea!
=C2=A0
Then came some great person, whose instinct=
s led him to take a horse instead of walking and ride it for a long distanc=
e [use of other tools]. He did find the sea after a few months. He put toge=
ther newer instructions to reach the sea, which included riding a horse [ne=
w aagamas].
=C2=A0
People performing the old rituals objected to this and s=
aid "but then this horse thing is not granted by the book of sea. This is a=
 new path and different from the "pure" sea ritual" ["pure" Vedic ritual]. =
By now, people did not even understand what the cryptic poems of the origin=
al "book of sea" mean, but they simply believed that those poems taught the=
 old "pure" sea rituals that they were used to. They were blissfully unawar=
e that the original instructions were meant for someone already close to se=
a and the newer instructions came from someone who actually saw the sea and=
 knew where they currently lived and how to get to the sea from there!
=C2=
=A0
Slowly many new sets of instructions involving horses, chariots etc wer=
e taught and many new paths to the sea were=C2=A0outlined=C2=A0instead of j=
ust instructing people to walk towards east=C2=A0[evolution of mantra/tantr=
a/ yantras].
=C2=A0
One particular path through jungles was dangerous [agho=
ra and other dark tantric paths involving practice of sex, meat, wine=C2=A0=
etc]. Though the distance to sea was much shorter through that jungle, it w=
as just too dangerous and only the bravest and strongest could make it. The=
re were cruel dacoits and wild animals [chance of a fall in a risky ritual]=
 and many weak people travelling to sea via that path were killed. A wise m=
an who knew the entire territory well=C2=A0came forward, condemned that pat=
h and discouraged people from trying that path. Since then, even people who=
 were strong enough to successfully make it in that path desisted from it.
=
=C2=A0
As time progressed, people started fighting too much about whose pat=
h was superior. They were foolish, not smart enough to adopt the original i=
nstructions, of either the so-called "pure" sea path or the so-called "new"=
 path or other variations, for the changed geography and changed times. Man=
y followed the instructions blindly, hit roadblocks and did not reach sea. =
Many did not even know that "reaching the sea" was the actual goal of all t=
heir joirneys. They only thought they were supposed to follow the instructi=
ons faithfully and there was no need to adopt to the changed geographical t=
erritory and time. They even condemned those who actually went to sea, came=
 back and gave updated directions for their place and=C2=A0time, for violat=
ing tradition.

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
In case the analogy is not cl=
ear, here is a brief summary of its points. Veda is about realizing self. V=
eda describes various aspects of=C2=A0the state of self-realization. That i=
s why it is considered the highest knowledge. Other allied subjects throw s=
ome light on possible ways to reach that state. While definitive statements=
 can be made on the actual state of self-realization itself, no definitive =
statements can be made on how to reach it. The path depends on one's curren=
t position!
=C2=A0
Great men in many spiritual paths, within Hinduism as we=
ll as outside of it, came, experienced that state, understood the current s=
tate of people around them=C2=A0and gave specific instructions on how to re=
ach that state from the current state. Some followed the instructions and e=
xperienced the state. Some instead kept arguing about the contradictions be=
tween paths.
=C2=A0
Please re-read the story and try to understand what eac=
h part of the story represents. If you understand this analogy well, this c=
an really clarify the meaningless nature of so many debates that people was=
te time with!

=C2=A0
He did conde=
mn some vaamaachaara (left-hand) practices of tantra like the use of sex, a=
lcohol, meat etc.
=C2=A0
However, please go back to my analogy. A great man=
 may condemn the use of a short path to reach the sea if it has a lot of wi=
ld animals and=C2=A0dacoits and many travellers through that path recently =
lost their lives. It does not mean that path is totally unusable. It only m=
eans that too many people incapable of travelling on that path are using it=
 of late and so the great man was compelled to stop the practice.
=C2=A0
If=
 the same great man is reincarnated at a different time when several adept =
souls he has a rina with are about to be reincarnated, he may not condemn t=
he path and instead write on travelling that jungle path carefully!
=C2=A0
=
The words of great masters need to be interpreted within the context of the=
ir desa, kaala and paatra and within the context of the purpose of that par=
ticular birth.

> 3. What is vamachara? if i=
t is the left hand method - sex, drinks etc,
> why must it be practiced at =
all?
=C2=A0
Suppose one's house is close to the market and the market noise=
 reaches one's house. Suppose that noise=C2=A0is disturbing one's meditatio=
n, i.e. one is unable to focus on god amid all the noise. There are two app=
roaches one can take - (1) run away from the noise, find a place of solitud=
e and meditate there. (2) rise to the challenge, meditate right there and d=
evelop the ability to turn off the sensory input to the mind, i.e. get mast=
ery and control over the part of the mind that is making one vulnerable to =
this disturbance. After all, the noise from outside is NOT the problem - th=
e problem is the *inability* of one's mind to turn off that sensory input. =
By controlling one's mind, one can focus attention on god irrespective of w=
hat is happening outside.
=C2=A0
Approach (1) is not bad. If one is weak-mi=
nded and has a decent chance of failure with approach (2), then approach (1=
) is definitely prudent and worthwhile. But, if one has a strong mind and c=
an succeed with approach (2), it is great. It hastens one's progress.

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Vaamaachaara is also like that, but a more extr=
eme form of testing one's self-control by rising to the challenge.
=C2=A0
P=
lease realize that vaamaachaara/ aghora is not about the use of sex, wine e=
tc for the kick of it. It is about their use to test oneself with the tough=
est challenges and hone one's self-control. Self-realization comes when sel=
f-control is perfect and one's mind can always be focussed on god no matter=
 what is going on around one. If one is either attracted or averse to any o=
ne thing, that is enough to block self-realization.
=C2=A0
However, if one =
is weak, it is better to stay away from vaamaachaara. One needs to do other=
 practices and strengthen oneself. If a really pure yogi with perfect self-=
control is able to focus on god with all his mind even when he is drunk and=
 sitting naked with a beautiful naked woman tightly embracing him, then he =
can try that to test his self-control and hone it. But, if that is going to=
=C2=A0tempt one, get the mind away from god and onto a physical enjoyment, =
then one better not try that path! Just as one who does not have a strong m=
ind to meditate amid noise should meditate in solitude and hone one's self-=
control, one who does not have a strong mind to keep the focus on god in th=
e middle of normally depriving practices such as wine, meat and sex should =
stay away from those.

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
In my analogy before, t=
he short jungle path to the sea having the danger of wild animals and dacoi=
ts represents the vaamaachaara path of aghora. If one not having the wherew=
ithal to battle and kill the wild animals and dacoits tries that path, one =
may be killed. Similarly, one who wants self-realization using this path wi=
ll fall if one does not have perfect self-control. If one takes this path b=
ecause it sounds cool or exciting, one is likely to fall. It is only for th=
e fittest and bravest.
=C2=A0
If there is ANY weakness in one's self-contro=
l, one can NOT follow this path. Just as there are many paths from the dese=
rt to the sea in my analogy, there are many paths to self-realization. One =
should follow the path that is appropriate for one based on previous samska=
ras, strengths and weaknesses.

> Is it not a f=
act that Sri Ambal lies above all these? 
=C2=A0
:-) Sri Ambal (the Divine =
Mother) does not lie above or below anything. She lies everywhere! All know=
ledge, all desires and all actions of all beings are Her own different mani=
festations.
=C2=A0
If a yogi with perfect self-control drinks wine and=C2=
=A0sits naked with a beautiful naked woman tightly embracing him and yet ke=
eps his mind fully focussed on god, his self-control, his focus on god are =
all different manifestations of the Divine Mother only.
=C2=A0
As a matter =
of fact, even if one gives in to base instincts and pursues carnal pleasure=
s, his desires and actions are also different manifestations of Divine Moth=
er only. The Mother gives rise to so many lower level forms with specific d=
omains of responsibility. The Mother takes the form of Lakshmi and Alakshmi=
 as well. She takes the form of Vidya and Avidya as well. All opposites and=
 polarities are actually Her manifestations only.
=C2=A0
However, those who=
 are more comfortable with Lakshmi and Vidya and uncomfortable with Alakshm=
i and Avidya will look at only the former pair as manifestation of Divine M=
other and remain in duality. That is a valid point of view. However, the *u=
ltimate* reality is that She is All.
=C2=A0
I need to sleep now. I will sto=
p here. Hope that put a few things in perspective. You can send further que=
stions to the yahoogroups or to me privately.

 couple of years ago=C2=A0in <deleted> temple.
=C2=A0
I have a few doubts. =
I would like to hear your opinion on the same.
=C2=A0
1. Are Vedic (Pure Va=
ithika rituals) different from Mantra Shastras (people explain that mantra =
shastra does not originate from the vedas, but classified under tantra). Di=
d Mantra shastras not originate from vedas?
=C2=A0
2. I read from somewhere=
 that Sri Sri Adi Sankara has condemned Tantrik practices. But I also hear =
and read that he is a great Sri Vidya Upasaka himself. If Sri Vidya has its=
 roots from Tantra, what did Sri Adi Sankara condemn? 
=C2=A0
3. What is va=
machara? if it is the left hand method - sex, drinks etc, why must it be pr=
acticed at all? Is it not a fact that Sri Ambal lies above all these? 
=C2=
=A0
I am a little (totally) confused. Hope your reply takes me out of the w=

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Once there were many people who live=

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>As peopl=
e started living a little away from the sea [less spiritually evolved], som=

, "keep walking towards east" and the instructions grew with time. People f=

<DIV><FONT face=

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Peop=
le started moving further and further inland and started living in a landlo=
cked desert far away from the sea. This generation had never seen a pool of=
 water like a lake, let alone a sea. T</FONT><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>he=
y faithfully performed the ritual of walking towards east, but did not find=
 sea. They debated endlessly whether one had to walk one mile or two miles =
or three miles and formed different schools of thought. Some walked their c=
hosen distance, found a tree or a building or some interesting object =
and even became satisfied that that was sea!</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=
=3DArial size=3D2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Then=
 came some great person, whose instincts led him to take a horse instead of=
 walking and ride it for a long distance [use of other tools]. He did find =
the sea after a few months. He put together newer instructions to reach the=
 sea, which included riding a horse [new aagamas].</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT =
face=3DArial size=3D2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>=
People performing the old rituals objected to this and said "but then this =
horse thing is not granted by the book of sea. This is a new path and diffe=
rent from the "pure" sea ritual" ["pure" Vedic ritual]. By now, people did =
not even understand what the cryptic poems of the original "book of sea" me=
an, but they simply believed that those poems taught the old "pure" sea rit=
uals that they were used to. They were blissfully unaware that the original=
 instructions were meant for someone already close to sea and the newer ins=
tructions came from someone who actually saw the sea and knew where they cu=
rrently lived and how to get to the sea from there!</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2=

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>One particular path through jungles was d=
angerous [aghora and other dark tantric paths involving practice of sex, me=
at, wine etc]. Though the distance to sea was much shorter through tha=
t jungle, it was just too dangerous and only the bravest and strongest coul=
d make it. There were cruel dacoits and wild animals [chance of a fall in a=
 risky ritual] and many weak people travelling to sea via that path were ki=
lled. A wise man who knew the entire territory well came forward, cond=
emned that path and discouraged people from trying that path. Since then, e=

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>As time progressed, people started fi=
ghting too much about whose path was superior. They were foolish, not smart=
 enough to adopt the original instructions, of either the so-called "pure" =
sea path or the so-called "new" path or other variations, for the changed g=
eography and changed times. Many followed the instructions blindly, hit roa=
dblocks and did not reach sea. Many did not even know that "reaching the se=
a" was the actual goal of all their joirneys. They only thought they were s=
upposed to follow the instructions faithfully and there was no need to adop=
t to the changed geographical territory and time. They even condemned those=
 who actually went to sea, came back and gave updated directions for their =
place and time, for violating tradition.</FONT></DIV>
