Namaste,

I am reproducing below an excerpt from an email sent by a person =
who was 
looking for a job for 2 yrs and failed 17-18 interviews. He starte=
d 
homam and japam and got two offers within 15 days. He calls it a 
"mirac=
le".

He sent me several mails earlier asking for an astrological advice. I=
t 
did not feel like there was anything I could do and I ignored. He 
disco=
vered the free homam manuals  and the vedic-wisdom yahoogroup, 
derived ins=
piration from the mails there and used the free resources on 
the homam web=
site. He saw immediate results.

*        *        *

I know some other peo=
ple whose problems were solved after they started 
doing homam or intense m=
editation. Exactly how much effort is needed 
depends on the individual cas=
e and the karmas involved. But, things like 
homam and intense meditation c=
an only help. God either solves one's 
problems or creates a situation wher=
e one rises above the problems, i.e. 
does not get affected by the problems=
. If one surrenders and worships 
god in fire, one's life will be steered b=
y god in the correct direction.

Though people pay too much attention to ma=
ny technical details and get 
worried that they may make mistakes, the most=
 important thing is 
devotion and surrender and many technical aspects are =
negotiable. Many 
people who never even lit a light in their life before ar=
e now doing 
daily homam and making brisk progress!

*        *        *

A=
 lot of people in serious problems send me their horoscope and ask for 
hel=
p. Sadly, I or any astrologer cannot solve their problems. Solving 
their p=
roblems is in their own hands!! Irrespective of the exact nature 
of blocki=
ng karmas, doing homam or intense meditation can only benefit 
one. Though =
people may think that they need an astrologer to tell them 
which deity to =
worship and otherwise bad things can happen, this is an 
unfounded fear.

I=
 have studied and experimented with astrology (still do) as well as 
anybod=
y alive today. I can declare with utmost confidence that our 
understanding=
 is half-baked at best and one cannot rely on astrology for 
life-changing =
decisions. On the other hand, one can rely on god. Gods 
like Ganesha, Kart=
ikeya, Vishnu, Krishna, Lakshmi, Shiva, Hanuman, Durga 
etc can give any ma=
terial or spiritual results, including moksha. 
Worshipping any of them is =
perfectly safe. Each deity puts a surrendered 
devotee on the correct path,=
 in one's own way. Each of them is far 
better than me or any astrologer al=
ive today, for changing your life for 
the better! Picking a deity based on=
 taste and doing homam or intense 
meditation is faaaaaaar better than appr=
oaching astrologers like me for 
astrological advice.

*        *        *
=

If you are unsure which deity to worship, worship Ganesha with Ganapathi 
=
homam. It is a superb sadhana to set one's life on the correct path, 
both =
materially and spiritually. You don't have to take my word for it. 
The pro=
of of the pudding is in eating it. Try it yourself for a few 
months and se=
e what happens. Your main problem will either be solved or 
your mental sta=
te will start to change so that the problem's impact on 
you is reduced. Yo=
u yourself will see how you are benefiting!

Also, there are many insightfu=
l and inspiring mails on spiritual sadhana 
on vedic-wisdom yahoogroup, whi=
ch have inspired many people to do homam 
and other sadhanas. A few mails o=
rganized in a PDF book form by some 
seekers can be downloaded freely at:

Generic fire ritual for Hi=
ndus and non-Hindus: 
http://tinyurl.com/fireritual

*        *        *

D=
on't wait till Mahakala stares in the face. Do some sadhana while this 
bod=
y still has some juice in it. If you are in problems, you have an 
added in=
centive to do sadhana. But, even otherwise, consider sadhana. A 
homam can =
be done in just 20-30 minutes. Spending 20-30 min worshipping 
god in fire =
everyday can change your life for the better and transform 
your personalit=
y completely.

In fact, it is Mother's wish that several people should regu=
larly 
worship various deities in fire again and progress. World is going t=
o be 
transformed drastically in the coming decades, at many levels. One of=
 
the changes is that thousands of simple people will actually find "god" 
=
using fire as the medium and show direction to many people around them. 
I =
am fool and don't know much, but I know this one thing with utmost 
confide=
nce.

Best regards,
Narasimha

Hello Narsimha=
 ji.
Pranam.
Homams and japams started and the miracle happened. Yes, I sta=
rted doing 
homams and japams by following guidelines from your homam websi=
te and 
from your emails on Vedic-wisdom list and a real life miracle happe=
ned 
for me. Narsimhaji I bow in front of you. I feel we, whoever, know you=
, 
are so fortunate that we got a Guru like you in this world. You are a 
M=
odern Age Guru who is enlightening us, showing us direction with all 
the v=
edic knowledge you got. I had known you for your Astrology wisdom 
but not =
that much for Vedic knowledge and wisdom. But now I know that in 
this face=
book and iphone era we have a Guru who can share Vedas 
knowledge with us a=
nd show us right path in this life sitting here in 
the US.
... This dates =
back to last year when my wife found your website over 
the internet and ca=
me to me saying she found a very easy way of doing 
homam by ourselves. She=
 always thought that for all our day to day 
problems that we were facing i=
n our life, we should perform some 
homam/pooja, but we didn=E2=80=99t know=
 how to do that. So when I looked at the 
link she sent to me I told the ge=
ntleman who had written this was our 
Narsimha guru, and If he was recommen=
ding to do homams and written 
something for it, then we should go for it, =
and for the first time we 
did homam at our home during navratri 2010.
As y=
ou know I was searching for full time job for last 2 yrs, and had 
failed 1=
7-18 interviews thus far- I think I had sent you emails a couple 
of times =
seeking some remedies- but you were busy. In 6 or 7 such 
interviews I reac=
hed close enough to think that I was going to get an 
offer letter but neve=
r got any. ...
I started searching Vedic astrology mailing list ... I found=
 one of your 
postings where you had written about hanuman chalisa and then=
 given a 
link for vedic-wisdom list. I started looking at that list and re=
ad 
about your experience with Manish Pandit, that made me read me many of =

your postings on that list. ... why couldn=E2=80=99t I do intense pooja an=
d 
homams and nullify that effect. I read your comment to surrender to one =

god and worship him same time everyday with full surrender and do 
homams.=
 I discussed this with my wife and we decided to take the route 
of homam a=
nd japams. We performed one homam and I started chanting 
Hanuman Chalisa e=
veryday with full devotion, attention and Surrender. 
...
I started doing d=
aily Hanuman Chalisa. Everyday I do Hanuman Chalisa 5/7 
times daily, and b=
efore starting I think about you, Manish Pandit and Pt 
XX=E2=80=94all thre=
e as my gurus. I start my japam by telling god that if I am 
honest and sin=
cere, haven=E2=80=99t committed anything wrong, then god should 
come and l=
 help me out. To my surprise just within 15 days, I got 2 
interview calls.=
 I went and attended interviews. The Interviews went 
well as always, but t=
his time I got the JOB OFFERs. Yeah, job offers at 
2 places. It ended my 2=
 years of struggle, I couldn=E2=80=99t believe it. I am 
planning to join o=
ne of them next Monday 20 th June. Hence this time it 
was not your Astrolo=
gy wisdom, it is your vedic wisdom that has helped 
me. I couldn=E2=80=99t =
believe what god has given. It was like a miracle.
Now I am determined that=
 I would keep doing homams as and when possible 
but japam daily for sure f=
or my rest of the life. I am a novice for 
homams so I am learning these th=
ings. I often see your youtube video on 
homams and try to follow this. I h=
ope someday I will get some mastery 
over this and do homams regularly with=
out errors. Your experiences and 
stories with Manish Pandit were very insp=
iring throughout this journey. 
Your those real time experiences with Manis=
h were great, they gave me 
credentials that if Narsimha guru is writing th=
ese things then there 
should be some truth behind this. That inspired me t=
hat if I surrender 
to god, god can help me too and he really helped me.
Th=
is time I had a material motive behind my homams and japams as I 
wanted to=
 get a full time, but I am sure this route will take me more 
towards spiri=
tuality and some day I would be able to help society and to 
this world in =
some way.  ...
