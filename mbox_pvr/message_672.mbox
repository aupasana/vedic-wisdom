Namaste Reema ji,
 
Duality refers to a state where there are polarities an=
d opposites. Some objects appear "beautiful" and some "ugly". Some objects =
and experiences give "happiness" and some "sadness". Some words are seen as=
 "praise" and some as "criticism". Some experiences cause "pleasure" and so=
me "pain". Some objects and experiences are seen as "desirable" and some as=
 "undesirable". And so on.
 
Non-duality is a state where there are no such=
 distinctions. There is just a Brahman in that state.
 
The state of non-du=
ality is reached by people who reach nirvikalpa samadhi. Most of the time, =
what most people experience is the state of duality. The field of duality i=
s the play of Shakti.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

  Please define dual and non-dual. Non-dual is relatively easy to fath=
om. Not so with the dual. Examples will help tremendously. For instance, ta=
ke a certain experience and please explain how to perceive it in dual mode =
vis-a-vis non-dual mode. Please overlook my ignorance and guide me.

  With=
 the blessings of Sri Vishnu,
  Reema.

  Your skepticism is justified.<BR>> <BR>> The duality is infi=

  Her power. One can understand unmanifested non-dual <BR>&=

  cannot hope to understand the dual world fully ever=
. She is <BR>> capable 
  of deluding even the greatest sadhaka with a w=

  one ventures into duality. She can mislead=
 *anyone* on *anything*. What She 
  <BR>> does and why She does that is=

  though we are all part=
 of the same Divinity, we are all not the same. <BR>> 
  In the non-dual=
 field, we are all the same. But, in the field of duality, we 
  <BR>> h=
ave differences due to previous vasanas (conditioning), which decide 
  wha=
t <BR>> and how much we can do within the dual world. When a being like =

  Krishna is <BR>> born with 16 kalas, He can do *anything* with the ob=
jects 
  of the dual world. <BR>> When a being like Sai Baba is born wit=
h 2 or 3 
  kalas, He can do a lot of <BR>> things in the dual world tha=
t are 
  impossible for others.<BR>> <BR>> Realizing the non-dual Sel=
f is 
  something that is possible for anyone, but <BR>> there are limit=
s imposed 
  on what things one can do in the dual world, based <BR>> on=
 the force of 
  previous conditioning. Thus, all are the same at one <BR>&=
