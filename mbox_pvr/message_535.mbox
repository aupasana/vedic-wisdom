Namaste Sir,

Do I know you from before?

If you do not mind, can I have your birthdata (date, time and place of 
birth)? You can send it privately to pvr@....

If your goal is reaching Vaikuntha loka and serving the Lord, just chant His 
name all the time when you are awake. Whether you are walking or talking or 
driving or typing or reading or writing or answering nature's calls, you can 
still silently chant His name in the mind.

If you do this enough, your mind will start chanting his name when it is 
asleep too!

Your goal should be to repeat a (any) name of the Lord all the time, so that 
taking that name becomes the second nature to your mind!

Other things are not as useful as getting addicted to a name of the Lord.

Best regards,
Narasimha
