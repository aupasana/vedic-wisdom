 am (PST) . Posted by: "rajarshi nandy" rajarshi14 Dear Ajit,

Thanks for t=
he explanations. Very interesting.

This reminds me of an incident with a g=
ood friend of mine. There is an individual I know, who had never chanted th=
e Savitur-Gayatri mantra ever. He used to feel, as per his own confession, =
no special love or attraction for this mantra and being born in a non-brahm=
in family, there was no religious-cultural occasion where he was formally i=
ntroduced to this mantra. 

One day while meditating on some Tantrik mantra=
s, he got a random inspiration to meditate on the Gayatri mantra. He had a =
vague idea of what the Gayatri mantra meant, and no idea at all of correct =
swara or intonation. So he started chanting, mentally and soundlessly, the =
Savitur Gayatri mantra. Within less than 20-30 japas of the mantra, he felt=
/saw - and I describe it as he told me - an unbroken steam of tremendous, p=
ure, flood of Golden Light above his head. Like a world above and outside o=
ur world. Intensely pure, intensely Divine. The eventual idea, he told me, =
was to enter into that stream of Light above and see things from that persp=
ective. But as long as there are impurities in the mind and body, it is not=
 possible to enter into that realm easily. The gunas must be in a stable eq=
uilibrium. Neither the laziness of Tamas, nor the impatience of rajas is co=
nducive for it, but the stable, illuminating, self-assurance of satwa leadi=
ng to a deeper
equanimity in mind and life is needed.

Apparently, he also =
realized that there are some Tantrik mantras of Ma which serve a similar pu=
rpose as the Gayatri mantra. They take a person to the spiritual planes abo=
ve.

So I asked him why did you not continue the meditation or japa of Gaya=
tri mantra, since there was a nice experience. He said it would have pulled=
 him in and he would not have been able to continue the spiritual practices=
 which he was already doing for some time, and leaving something half way i=
s not good.

Reading the explanation your provided below, that is : 

"We m=
editate upon that Savitaa (yaH) who impels (prachodayaat) our (naH) 
though=
ts (dhiyaH). He blesses us with subtle eyesight. Without his 
light, we wou=
ld not be able to distinguish different objects. This is 
explained in the =
Aitaterya Upanishad =E2=80=9CThe sun, having become eyesight, 
entered the =
eyes=E2=80=9D. He thus blesses all living beings."

.. matches with the des=
cription that I had heard from my friend. Quite interesting!

-Regards

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Gayatri -- Savita


  
Namaste,
 
Painganadu Gan=
apati Shastri was a well known aasthaana vidvaan of the Kanchi Peetham. He =
wrote a simple, lucid commentary on the Gayatri mantra. It starts with a su=
mmary in 32 shlokas, followed by an introduction. He then gives 4 explanati=
ons / meditations on the mantra -- (1) gayatri, (2) narayana, (3) paramashi=
va and (4) paramatma.
 
I am not attempting a literal or scholarly translat=
ion ... I=E2=80=99ll try to summarize the main point, from a practical poin=
t of view. I=E2=80=99ll start with the first of the meditations, on Gayatri=
.
 
 ----
 
The first meditation is the =E2=80=9Ccommon=E2=80=9D understand=
ing of the Gayatri mantra, with the Sun as the devata. This follows the fam=
ous verse from the Agastya Smriti -- =E2=80=9Cyo devaH savitA  .asmAkam dhi=
yo dharmAdigocarAH. prerayet tasya yad bhargaH tad vareNyam upAsmahe=E2=80=
=9D. 
 
We meditate upon (dhiimahi) the splendor / tejas (bhargaH) of the d=
eva (devasya) that is the Sun (savituH). This tejas is the light of the sun=
, which is experienced by all living beings, and is thus easy to meditate u=
pon.
 
Whatever is experienced is easy to meditate upon, and that which is =
not experienced can be difficult to meditate upon. Everyone can meditate up=
on the light of the Sun. This is why this meaning for the Gayatri mantra is=
 always taken first. 
 
vareNyam =3D whatever we can ask / desire. Through =
all karmas and upaasanaas, whatever fruits we may ask for is vareNyam. =E2=
=80=9CSavitaa" is the fruit of all karmas ... this is taught in the Chandog=
ya Upanishad. [ A long explanation follows, which is omitted here ].  We me=
ditate upon the splendor of the sun, which is vareNyam.
 
We meditate upon =
that Savitaa (yaH) who impels (prachodayaat) our (naH) thoughts (dhiyaH). H=
e blesses us with subtle eyesight. Without his light, we would not be able =

a Re: Jayaadi homam Mon Jan 7, 2013 11:24 am (PST) . Posted by: "Narasimha =
PVR Rao" pvr108 
Namaste,

This is correct. Traditionally, Jayadi homam is =
performed as a part of 
Uttarangam (concluding offerings). One can include =
this in any homam. If 
you follow the homam manuals on my website, make off=
erings with the 
mantras of Jayaadi homam just before the offerings mention=
ed under 
"Uttarangam" in the manuals (offerings to Fire, Wind, Sun, C=
reator, 
Sustainer and Destroyer).

Veda mantras of Jayaadi homam make offe=
rings to various celestial beings 
that support our lives. It is a really n=
ice set of mantras, but suitable 
only for those who who are comfortable wi=
th Vedic intonation and also 
those who have a lot of time. If you do a 4 h=
our homam, having a 20 
minute wrap up by making offerings to various being=
s makes sense. If you 
have only 30 minutes, you are better off focusing on=
 the main deity. If 
Ganapathi, Chandi, Vishnu etc are pleased (i.e. main c=
hosen deity for 
homam), other beings will also eventually be pleased. The =
basic wrap up 
(Fire, Wind, Sun, Creator, Sustainer & Destroyer) are suffic=
ient. There 
is no need for an extended wrap up.

However, it will be very =
nice if some people with time, energy and 
proficiency in Vedic intonated c=
hanting can include this in their homam 
once every month or quarter or yea=
r.

Best regards,
Narasimha

ssages (4) . Top ^ 3a A Few Ganapathi Mantras (Re: Lakshmi Ganapathi homam)=
 Mon Jan 7, 2013 5:21 pm (PST) . Posted by: "Narasimha PVR Rao" pvr108 
Nam=
aste,

There are two versions in the Ganapathi mantra compendium I refer to=
:

(1) OM shrIM gaM saumyAya gaNapataye varavarada sarvajanaM me 
vashamAna=
ya svAhA

I think Ajit has already given the same.

(2) OM namo lakShmIgaNe=
shAya mahyaM putraM prayachCha svAhA

This version is used specifically for=
 begetting children. Recommended 
procedure is to keep some butter in front=
, chant this mantra and then 
for the lady wanting a child to eat it (after=
 bath at the end of her 
menstrual period).

(3) In addition, there is a ma=
ntra for Lakshmi sitting on the lap of 
Ganapathi (gaNeshAMka nivAsinI mahA=
lakShmI mantra). This mantra can also 
be offered to Lakshmi as a part of a=
 Ganapathi homam:

OM shrIM hrIM klIM glauM gaM OM namo bhagavati mahAlakSh=
mi varade shrIM 
vibhUtyai svAhA

This is specifically used for prosperity.=
 Mahalakshmi on the lap of 
Ganesha symbolizes tremendous prosperity that c=
omes with stability that 
is accompanied by childlike innocence and unwaver=
ing focus.

(4) There is another Ganapathi mantra with Lakshmi beeja occurr=
ing 
several times. It is known as Sampadganapathi mantra. It is also 
reco=
mmended for prosperity:

OM shrIM glauM hrIM OM shrIM hrIM klIM glauM gaM s=
hrIM glauM hrIM 
gaNapate vara-varada shrIM glauM hrIM sarva-janaM me vasha=
mAnaya 
sampadaM dehi svAhA

* * *

A few other Ganapathi mantras that can =
be useful to some people here. If 
you like any of them, you may offer them=
 to Ganapathi in fire in your 
Ganapathi (or some other) homam. If mantra h=
as no "svAhA" at the end, 
add it to make an offering in fire. If it alread=
y has a svAhA at the 
end, offer it as is and there is no need to add anoth=
er svAhA.

(1) Buddhi Ganapathi mantra (for intellectual sharpness and good=
 
speech): OM aiM gaM vAggaNapataye namaH
(2) Guru Ganapathi mantra (to bri=
ng one's guru): OM gaM gaNapataye 
sarva-vighna-harAya sarvAya sarva-gurave=
 lambodarAya hrIM gaM namaH
(3) Soura Ganapathi mantra (to cure diseases): =
OM jyoM saH saH jyoM 
ghR^iNissUrya Aditya OM OM shrIM hrIM klIM glauM gaM =
gaNapate 
vara-varada jyOM saH sarva-rogAn hara hara saH jyOM svAhA
(4) Nil=
akantha Ganapathi mantra (to remove poisons from body): OM proM 
OM shrIM h=
rIM klIM glauM gaM nrIM gaNapate vara-varada ThaH sarva viShaM 
me nAshaya =
svAhA
(5) Vidya Ganapathi mantra (for good learning): aiM blUM OM shrIM hrI=
M 
klIM glauM gaM aiM blUM gaNapate vara-varada aiM blUM vidyAm dehi svAhA
=
(6) Sankatahara Ganapathi mantra (when one is in serious troubles): 
shrIM =
OM gaNapataye namo varavarada me 
pratibandha-R^iNa-dAridrya-roga-saMkaTAn =
nivAraya svAhA
(7) Rina Hara Ganapthi mantra (for relief from debts): OM ga=
Nesha R^iNaM 
Chindhi vareNyaM huM namaH phaT (aggressive version)
(8) Rina=
 Mochana Ganapthi mantra (for relief from debts): OM glAM 
R^iNa-mochana ga=
Nadhipataye namaH (gentler version)

Thankyou PVR ji for sharing all the spe=
cific mantras.

my 2 cents and please feel free to correct me if i am wrong=
.

One God manifests as different deities with different attributes and cha=
racters. In the very same way each specialized form of diety himself has hi=
s own characteristics and temperament (from benovelent to playful to xxxxx =
). This holds true for ganapati also.

It might be far far more better to s=
tick to Mahaganapati and do a homam to him with his simple mantra for HIS p=
leasure (not urs), and AFTER homam (before saying goodby) ask for his grace=
, love, his help to solve whatever ur problems.

Its my experience that com=
plicated mantra with specific purpose tend to be "driven by" and "invoke" a=
 specific want in our greedy nature, rather than having love, surrender and=
 joy for diety.

Posted by: "Narasimha PVR Rao" pvr108 
Namaste Sir,

If you don't mind a cr=
itical comment from me, first stop thinking in 
terms of deriving "maximum =
benefit".

One who wants to get "maximum benefit" from relationship with mo=
ther or 
wife or daughter and thinking in those terms is unlikely to really=
 enjoy 
a good relationship with them. One who learns to love them and give=
 them 
whatever one is in a position to give, without doing any calculation=
s, 
will actually end up enjoying a great and emotionally fulfilling 
relat=
ionship.

Similarly, one who wants "maximum benefit" from a mantra or deity=
u and 
thinks in those terms will not really enjoy a good relationship with=
 a 
mantra or deity. One who learns to love a mantra and give it whatever 
=
time and energy one is in a position to give, without doing any 
calculatio=
ns, will actually end up enjoying a great and spiritually 
fulfilling relat=
ionship.

* * *

One possibility is to focus on the sound of the mantra and=
 its ups and 
downs and not visualize any form.

Another possibility is to =
imagine 5-headed Ma Gayatri. She controls the 
door at the bottom of Sushum=
na nadi (the channel of pure awareness) for 
Kundalini (self-awareness) to =
rise up. The five heads are perhaps 
symbols of the five sheaths in our exi=
stence (sheaths of matter, life 
force, mind, awareness and bliss).

Anothe=
r possibility is to imagine Savita, the bright spiritual Sun 
("Self") who =
shines light on every object of this cosmos.

Another possibility is to ima=
gine Savitri, the consort of Savita, who 
shines as a bright light that fil=
ls entire Sushumna nadi, in which all 
seven worlds exist.

Another possibi=
lity is to imagine Savita and Savitr together.

Abother possibility is to i=
magine Supreme Cosmic Being who with his 
Shakti creates, sustains and dest=
roys all worlds and beings in them. You 
can imagine Him as a super-person =
with thousands of hands, legs, heads 
etc, who is seeing, hearing, smelling=
, tasting through all beings of 
cosmos. Or you can imagine him as a bright=
 light from which every world 
and being comes. Or you can imagine him as t=
he sound of Om that 
reverberates in the entire cosmos and causes all movem=
ent in the 
consciousness of all beings. All these visualizations are very =
small 
aspects of his actual personality!!!!!!!!!!

Now, if you want, you c=
an give a name to this supreme cosmic being and 
call him as Krishna or Nar=
ayana or Sadashiva or Ahora Mazda or Holy 
Ghost or whatever.

If it is eas=
ier, you can imagine the Shakti of Supreme Cosmic Being and 
imagine how Sh=
e pervades the entire cosmos and creates, sustains and 
destroys everything=
.

Now, if you want, you can give a name to this Shakti and call Her Aadyaa=
 
Shakti or Paraa Shakti or Mahalaskshmi or Durga or Lalita or Chandi or 
j=
ust Ma or whatever.

* * *

Now, out of all these possibilities, what is th=
e best? That depends on 
YOU, Sir. Whatever visualization makes it easier f=
or you to love and get 
lost in, it, is better for you. Only you can know t=
hat.

In the beginning, one may force oneself and do sadhana mechanically. =

There may be a lot of force and friction in sadhana. But, eventually, it 
=
should become smooth. Friction should reduce and enjoyment should 
increase=
. It may take a long time. But, until that happens, one is just 
rehearsing=
.

Best regards,
Narasimha

Dear All,
=

All these are for the novice.

When you transcend, there is no difference =
between Him and you !

Dont be like the Bible people who quote from verses,=
 highlighting the 
page, without understanding what is implied.

I am not d=
ecrying Nama Japa.

Namamanu Adbhutha Swargam
Namamanu Punarbaham
Namamanu =
Maha Siddhi
Namamanu Samasthavum

All these techniques are a great preparat=
ion for Liberation ( Aurobindo 
). Not the End itself .

They are all means=
 to an end. What Jesus said or others said matter not, 
it is your Self Rea=
lisation which is important ! All Books are Docta 
Ignorantia or Learned Ig=
norance, they cannot define Him !

Work out your Salvation with diligence !=

Subject: [vedic-w=
isdom] Re: Reciting Vishnusahasranamam

Just wanted to add 2 cents before a=
nybody takes this name equivalence 
literally and goes on a wild goose chas=
e.

The arithmetic of one name being equivalent to 1000 other names are jus=
t 
phala shruti/artha- vada. Hence they are never meant to be taken 
litera=
lly ever. They are meant to encourage the devotee to pursue a 
particular p=
ath.

1. The Rama Rameti shloka tells one Rama name equals 100 names of 
Vi=
shnu. (This shloka is from Padma Purana)

2. Next we have Brahmanda Purana =
that says:
sahasra-namnam punyanam, trir-avrttya tu yat phalam;
ekavrttya t=
u krsnasya, namaikam tat prayacchati

one Krishna Japa =3D 3 Rama Japa

3. =
What more, the same anushashasana parva in which Vishnu Sahasra Nama 
is pr=
esent in Mahabharata has Krishna saying this :

yO mAm nama sahasrena stotu=
micchati pandava
yohamekena shlokena stuta eva na samshaya

By saying this =
Krishna is implying that one can get the same punya os 
saying entire Vishn=
u sahasra nama just by saying one shloka of Vishnu 
Sahasra nama.. Now each=
 shloka of VSN is equivalent to entire VSN 
itself..
Now we have circular r=
eference in the equation that can never be 
satisfied !! (Much like GNU sta=
nds for GNU is not UNIX !!)

Hence this one name being equivalent to N othe=
r names is a wild goose 
chase. As PVRji said, its all in the state of mind=
.

But there is a specific meditation technique that can be specifically 
a=
pplied to Vishnu Sahasra nama and it is mentioned in preface of VSN 
itself=
 (yaani naamaani gauNani vikhyaataani mahatmanah). Here gauNa does 
not mea=
n minor. It means "being related to guna". It means each name 
extolls one =
(several actually) attributes of Vishnu. One can ponder over 
that quality =
of Vishnu as that name comes up. It takes up time to 
practice such techniq=
ue and requires quite a bit of cross reference 
reading. It is to be slowly=
 developed over time. But it is very 
effective.

Srikanth

 goes on a wild goose chase. 
The arithmetic of one name being equivalent t=
o 1000 other names are just phala shruti/artha- vada. Hence they are never =
meant to be taken literally ever. They are meant to encourage the devotee t=
o pursue a particular path. 
1. The Rama Rameti shloka tells one Rama name =
equals 100 names of Vishnu. (This shloka is from Padma Purana) 
2. Next we =
have Brahmanda Purana that says: sahasra-namnam punyanam, trir-avrttya tu y=
at phalam; ekavrttya tu krsnasya, namaikam tat prayacchati 
one Krishna Jap=
a =3D 3 Rama Japa 
3. What more, the same anushashasana parva in which Vish=
nu Sahasra Nama is present in Mahabharata has Krishna saying this : 
yO mAm=
 nama sahasrena stotumicchati pandava yohamekena shlokena stuta eva na sams=
haya 
By saying this Krishna is implying that one can get the same punya os=
 saying entire Vishnu sahasra nama just by saying one shloka of Vishnu Saha=
sra nama.. Now each shloka of VSN is equivalent to entire VSN itself.. Now =
we have circular reference in the equation that can never be satisfied !! (=
Much like GNU stands for GNU is not UNIX !!) 
Hence this one name being equ=
ivalent to N other names is a wild goose chase. As PVRji said, its all in t=
he state of mind. 
But there is a specific meditation technique that can be=
 specifically applied to Vishnu Sahasra nama and it is mentioned in preface=
 of VSN itself (yaani naamaani gauNani vikhyaataani mahatmanah). Here gauNa=
 does not mean minor. It means "being related to guna". It means each name =
extolls one (several actually) attributes of Vishnu. One can ponder over th=
at quality of Vishnu as that name comes up. It takes up time to practice su=
ch technique and requires quite a bit of cross reference reading. It is to =
be slowly developed over time. But it is very effective.

BR>Thanks for the explanations. Very interesting.<BR><BR>This reminds me of=
 an incident with a good friend of mine. There is an individual I know, who=
 had never chanted the Savitur-Gayatri mantra ever. He used to feel, as per=
 his own confession, no special love or attraction for this mantra and bein=
g born in a non-brahmin family, there was no religious-cultural occasion wh=
ere he was formally introduced to this mantra. <BR><BR>One day while medita=
ting on some Tantrik mantras, he got a random inspiration to meditate on th=
e Gayatri mantra. He had a vague idea of what the Gayatri mantra meant, and=
 no idea at all of correct swara or intonation. So he started chanting, men=
tally and soundlessly, the Savitur Gayatri mantra. Within less than 20-30 j=
apas of the mantra, he felt/saw - and I describe it as he told me - an unbr=
oken steam of tremendous, pure, flood of Golden Light above his head. Like =
a world above and outside our world. Intensely pure, intensely Divine. The =
eventual idea, he told me, was to enter into that stream of Light above and=
 see things from that perspective. But as long as there are impurities in t=
he mind and body, it is not possible to enter into that realm easily. The g=
unas must be in a stable equilibrium. Neither the laziness of Tamas, nor th=
e impatience of rajas is conducive for it, but the stable, illuminating, se=
lf-assurance of satwa leading to a deeper<BR>equanimity in mind and life is=
 needed.<BR><BR>Apparently, he also realized that there are some Tantrik ma=
ntras of Ma which serve a similar purpose as the Gayatri mantra. They take =
a person to the spiritual planes above.<BR><BR>So I asked him why did you n=
ot continue the meditation or japa of Gayatri mantra, since there was a nic=
e experience. He said it would have pulled him in and he would not have bee=
n able to continue the spiritual practices which he was already doing for s=
ome time, and leaving something half way is not good.<B
