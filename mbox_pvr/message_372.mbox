 & learned about your software, SJC, books by=A0Pandit=A0Rath ji=A0etc I wa=
s set in motion & since then in free time I study books only from SJC. Of t=
he many books I browsed till now,=A0your's is the excellent & I am indebted=
 to you.

 I am writing this mail so that if not now(due to your busy schedule) in fu=

=A0
I didn't mean to make you feel bad or to suggest that one should not t=
ry to help others and focus on oneself. If I thought so, I would not be doi=
ng so many things I do, like replying to mails, putting together homam manu=
als etc. My comment 3 came after the first 2. I was just trying to bring in=
 another angle after the first two.
=A0
One cannot stop focussing inwards a=
nd correcting oneself ever. Even a yogi who is able to change the spiritual=
 lives of millions cannot drop guard and has to be looking inwards. That wa=
s my point.
=A0
It is good to help others and try to be "instrumental in th=
eir path to know the truth". However, after engaging in action that one's j=
udgment says one should engage in, one should earnestly surrender the doers=
hip to the Lord and move on. It is not worthwhile to cling on to the owners=
hip of too many actions for too long as people normally do. In fact, it is =
a big problem. People don't realize it. One getting used to cancer and livi=
ng with it for 50 years=A0may forget how it is to live without that disease=
. Similarly, a being used to living with this cancer (of persistent mental =
ownership of many many many actions) for many lives may forget how it is to=
 live without that disease!
=A0
After all rituals like pooja and=A0homam, w=
e do say "sarvam sree krishnaarpanamastu" .=A0Though people say it without =
understanding, it means that you surrender the action finished just now to =
Krishna. After that, you are not the owner. You should really feel that way=
.
=A0
One can adopt that attitude to everything in life, do the action as p=
erfectly as one can and then surrender the doership to the Lord. Unfortunat=
ely, many people do good things and cling on to the ownership within their =
mind for too long. This causes many problems and also binds one. Pride that=
 they did something good or sadness that they missed something or happiness=
 that a good result came from that action or sadness that the intended resu=
lt did not happen start eating one's mind later on and stop the mind from a=
cting optimally on *future actions*. If one truly surrenders the ownership =
of every action after the action finishes, one forms a distance between one=
self and the results that the actions may bring later on. That distance is =
really needed for a stable and blissful state of mind and optimum output fr=
om one's mind.

=A0
Quite honestly, ego IS present in all beings by default, incl=
uding the lowest beings like amoeba and bacteria. A discussion of the neces=
sity of ego to be present is superfluous, as ego IS present anyway in all b=
eings. By the way, ego in our literature does not mean "egotism"=A0or self-=
importance or pride (which are the meaning in which the word is used these =
days). Ego simply means self-consciousness and self-awareness. They are alw=
ays there in all beings=A0and it is an uphill climb to lose them by introsp=
ecting each thought, word and action of oneself.
=A0

Narasimh=

Vedic Wisdom. Your presentation of matter is excellent. Although I am not a=

dy any of them in detail. I happened to Purchase your book "Integrated appr=
oach to Vedic Astrology" just by chance. But once I began reading it & =
learned about your software, SJC, books by Pandit Rath ji et=

 SJC. Of the many books I browsed till now, your's is the excellent &a=

<DIV>By now have you com=

 karma are complex. Thinking like "this is a noble karma. So it is <BR>&g=

lopment is smaller (than it would be if that development was <BR>> inten=

gt; > Your question is kind of an oxymoron. Can good aghoris become "wel=
l-<BR>> known" and come to limelight? :-)<BR>> >  <BR>> &g=
t; I know one masterly aghori reasonably well. However, he is not <BR>> =
restricted to one path. All
 paths are his own and he does not <BR>> dis=
tinguish. He does aghora sadhanas in smashana and also Vedic <BR>> sadha=
nas like Vedic homas with the same attitude. He chants Vedic <BR>> mantr=
as too. For example, when he chants Sri Rudram, it produces <BR>> amazin=
g energy all around. He is a bhakti yogi too. When he thinks of <BR>> Kr=
ishna, he melts in devotion. When he discusses upanishads and other <BR>>=
; Vedanta texts such as Yoga Vaasishtham and BhagavadGita, his keen <BR>>=
; intellect shines forth like a Sun and illuminates the thinking of a <BR>&=
gt; ready audience. I have never seen anyone who has such a perfect <BR>>=
; understanding of the essence of Upanishads and exudes it in thoughts, <BR=
>> words and actions. He has wife and children, has a full-time job and =
<BR>> engages in several external activities and is never idle. But his =
<BR>> level of detachment with the work he does so expertly is far highe=
r <BR>> than even
 ascetics who renounce everything and *try* to develop=
 some <BR>> detachment.<BR>> >  <BR>> > Bottomline is t=
hat he is an aghori, but he is also a jnaana yogi, <BR>> bhakti yogi, ka=
rma yogi and raaja yogi. He is a vaidika and he is an <BR>> aghori. All =
paths are his and he views all the same way. I don't know <BR>> if all r=
eally good aghoris are like that or just he.<BR>> >  <BR>> &g=
t; In any case, it is irrelevant to you if any aghori succeeded or <BR>>=
 not. If YOU are meant to succeed in aghota, you will. If not, you <BR>>=
 will not. To be safe, until the right time and right person comes, <BR>>=
; one should not venture into aghora. I want people to appreciate <BR>> =
different things for what they are and not have unhealthy biases, but <BR>&=
gt; it does not mean everybody should try everything. Nuclear engineers <BR=
>> hating politicians, politicians hating lawyers and lawyers hating <BR=
>> doctors
 is bad. But one should become what one is supposed to!<BR>&g=

 the aghora <BR>> series of books is nothing short of amazing. It=
