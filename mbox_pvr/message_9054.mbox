hings going. 1 - Bhuta Suddhi. Constant efforts of purification of the vari=
ous elements that compose the human mind-body structure. In simpler words t=
his translates into more detachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness=
, control of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalin=
i awakening happens, one has to now self identify with the Devata with grea=
ter force. Devotion of a far more intense kind is must. The Devata then tak=
es care of the journey. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens =
- IF and when it really does - it can also open up the mind and body to var=
ious other things and entities, some of which are not postive in nature whi=
le some of them are useless, and given half a chance can make use of the in=
dividual for its own ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness in characte=
r and nature and miss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi become=
s even more
 vital. 4 - While someday or other every sadhaka will have an e=
xperience of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of =
psychology are because of this. The human psychology as understood by west =
today is puerile and insufficient to deal with various things. It is also p=
ossible sometimes that the aura of an individual, which protects us from va=
rious subtle influences and helps us to remain as functional entities, can =
get "ruptured" due to various reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifes=
tyles, trauma etc. That can allow free assess of various entities inside th=
e mind and they have chances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are =
very complex and various possiblities are there, it is not possible to list=
 down every option. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly done, v=
ery few can have the right knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who cla=
im they can do so, are often doing nothing more than an intelligent guess w=
ork.
 Sometimes it will have results, sometimes not. For all these to be ac=
hieved, the starting point is a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient =
Greeks used to say - Mens sana in corpore sano. -Regards =A0Rajarshi

ased on my recent experience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry =
job at present, and have been involved in the care of someone who seems to =
think she has had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since childhoo=
d. This has involved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the bo=
dy. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini until her =
symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. We have not been able=
 to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might=
 be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally il=
l describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous=
 kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest and research into this to=
pic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-und=
erstood by western medicine, and as we have no treatments for deranged
 kun=
dalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kund=
alini. My experience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini sho=
uld not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at times beca=
use the suffering from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will con=
sume her, and it is something she cannot escape from. I wondered what solut=
ion there could be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divin=
e Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this w=
oman- and either cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. May I req=
uest that the good samaritans among you pray for her, and for others like h=
er (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. And let u=
s be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ourselves=
. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest =
to say "let me be your instrument" and leave the kundalini
 rising bit to G=
od's will. Om Dum Durgayai Namaha Aparna

 but it may or may not be one.<br>
 <br>It must be conceded though tha=
t Kundalini spontaneously rising through various nadis without one having g=
one through proper preparation in this life (i.e. fine-tuning of one's atti=
tude and development of detachment) CAN create havoc!<br>
 <br>One may=
 wonder how Kundalini may spontaneously rise in a layman with no sadhana, w=
hile many serious sadhakas may not experience it.<br> <br>Firstly, Kun=
dalini rise is NOT an achievement. It is just A SMALL
 STEP in overcoming o=
ne's current limited identity.<br> <br>Let me give an analogy. One wan=
ting to move from one's small dilapidated house (this
 body-mind complex) t=
o a huge palace (realized Self) may first construct the palace over time an=
d move into it when it is COMPLETE. Alternately, if one occasionally goes a=
nd stays in the palace still under construction (analogy for out of body ex=
periences due to Kundalini rise), is it an achievement? In fact, it comes w=
ith risks. The former approach is safer and one loses nothing in it. Simila=
rly, one can progress towards complete Self-realization without any out of =
body experiences. These are not my word's, but Maharshi Vasishtha's words t=
o Lord Rama.<br>
 <br>Secondly, one does not get something without wan=
ting it and putting sufficient effort towards it. One may have deeply desir=
ed a Kundalini rise in a previous life and may have put enough effort. As a=
 result, one may be getting it now. But one may be unprepared (and ironical=
ly may not even want it!) when it comes in this life.<br>
 <br>As you =
do sadhana, try not to fancy too many specific
 desires. Nature has a delay=
 mechanism in granting your desires (because of constraints on what Nature =
can give you right now, arising from YOUR
 OWN previous actions). So Nature=
 sometimes gives you what you want LATE, when you no longer want it or want=
 something else. For example, one may pray for great wealth one's whole lif=
e and be born as a rich but very sick man in next life. One may not enjoy t=
hat wealth and pray whole life for health. In the life after that, one may =
be very healthy, but not have any knowledge or money. </span><span>In anoth=
er 
case, one may deeply desire to act in a famous film. One may be reborn =

as a tiger or a dog and act in a famous film, but not really enjoy that 
e=
xperience. Basically, people </span><span>keep going in circles through var=
ious lives, always "seeking" something they are "missing".<br> <br>Any=
way, coming back to Kundalini, if one deeply desires an out of body experie=

esire destined to fructify (if there is enough karmik force behind it).<br>=

 <br>The best approach I recommend is to NOT think in terms of Kund=

 <br>One word on surrendering to a personal deity. Though =
true surrender is helpful, most people do not have it. They simply do busin=

and bare fact.<br>
 <br>"I want X, </span><span><span>I will pray to y=
ou and </span>please give it to me", "I am scared of Kundalini rise, I will=

thinking of Lord with fascination and pleasure, even in the face of (and du=

 <br>If one without true surrender and with many desi=
res and wrong notions experiences a Kundalini rise, one may still be trappe=
d, despite thinking of a personal god. It is not that god does not want to =
"protect" one as said below. It is not about protecting or endangering. If =
you go back to my "chipmunk glued to mouse trap" example above, I was tryin=
g to protect it, but it was scared. Similarly, one's conditioning makes one=
 *run away* from God's

 this is temporary and can be taken away anytime. Enjoy it while you have a=

etachment and a very light mental conditioning (very light desires, dislike=
s etc) can protect one as one's Kundalini rises to meet True Self. Heavy co=

>In Tantra, to focus on Kundalini, one needs a few things going. 1 - Bhuta =
Suddhi. Constant efforts of purification of the various elements that compo=

t, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, on=

<div>
<div>Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of kundalini syn=
drome based on my recent experience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psyc=
hiatry job at present, and have been involved in the care of someone who se=
ems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since c=
hildhood. This has involved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in=
 the body. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini unt=
il her symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. We have not be=
en able to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so i=
t might be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call ment=
ally ill describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spon=
taneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest and research into =
this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not w=
ell-understood by western medicine, and as we have no treatments
 for deran=
ged kundalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken t=
he kundalini. My experience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundal=
ini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at tim=
es because the suffering from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it w=
ill consume her, and it is something she cannot escape from. I wondered wha=
t solution there could be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to th=
e Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of=
 this woman- and either cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. Ma=
y I request that the good samaritans among you pray for her, and for others=
 like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. An=
d let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ou=
rselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps =
safest to say "let me be your
 instrument" and leave the kundalini rising b=
it to God's will. Om Dum Durgayai Namaha Aparna </div></div></div></div></d=
