Namaste,

Some of you guys were discussing Raktabeeja stor=
y after the homam. I am sending excerpts from a few mails I sent sometime b=
ack to our astrology yahoogroups. They give a different perspective on Rakt=
abeeja story and Madhukaitabha story. The purpose of these mails was to pro=
voke thinking in those who were ready. This mail is a little long and read =
it at leisure.

Best regards,
Narasimha
-----------------------------------=
------------------

Some people mistakenly think that Chandi Saptashati is =
merely an account of the exploits of Durgaa and her slaying of demons Mahis=
ha, Chanda, Munda, Raktabeeja, Shumbha, Nishumbha etc. They view it as a co=
llection of stories. But, IMHO, that is a very limited view. Devi mahatmyam=
 is much more than a collection of stories. After all, Vedas are its swaroo=
pam! Rigveda, Yajurveda and Saamaveda are the swaroopam (form/essence/a dif=
ferent manifestation) of the three parts of Chandi Saptashati. The purpose =
of Vedas is self-knowledge. How can something with Vedas as its swaroopam b=
e about something other than self-knowledge? 

*        *        *

Though =
Devi Mahatmyam looks like stories, there are very valuable lessons on Her n=
ature in it. The deeper you go, the more you can understand and appreciate =
the lessons in the stories. Let me give a couple of examples.

(1) When var=
ious Mothers are going to war with demons, this is how it is described (8-1=
4): "Whatever form, decoration, weapons and vehicle each god has, his shakt=
i (energy) came in the same form, decoration, weapons and vehicle." The nex=
t 9 verses describe how Brahmaani etc came. For example, Brahmaani came on =
a swan with aksha sutra and kamandalu (worn by Brahma), Maaheswari came on =
a great bull with a Trishoola and She wore a big snake and Moon. And so on.=


What is the message hidden in the above description? The normal imagery p=
ainted elsewhere is of female deities with a separate form. Here, they are =
depicted differently.

The fact that these female deities are identical to =
the male counterparts in form, decoration, weapons and vehicles suggests, t=
o me, that they are not really separate from the male counterparts. Brahma =
and Brahmaani are not separate. Maheswara and Maaheswari are not separate. =
Vishnu and Vaishnavi are not separate. And so on. Brahmaani is simply the s=
hakti (vitality/energy) of Brahma. Maaheswari is simply the shakti (vitalit=
y/energy) of Maheswara. And so on.

If Vaishnavi went on Garuda vehicle and=
 killed a demon, it actually means that Vishnu went on a Garuda vehicle and=
 killed the demon. Vaishanvi is the personification of Vishnu's energy, whi=
ch makes Vishnu be, think, desire, move and act. Vaishnavi is not separate =
from Vishnu.

Of course, if you imagine Vaishnavi (Lakshmi) as a separate p=
erson with certain attributes, She may manifest limited by your imagination=
 and even give you a darshan in that form. However, that is a limited form =
and Her true nature is beyond that. Her true and highest nature is that She=
 is an inseparable part of Vishnu and represents the energy of Vishnu. She =
is the part of Vishnu that makes Vishnu think, desire, act etc. Vaishnavi i=
s basically Chetana (animated consciousness) of Vishnu.

Thus, contemplatio=
n on these verses will make you understand the true nature of male devatas =
and female devatas and their relationship better. It will enable you to app=
reciate the highest nature of Shakti.

Puranas personify everything to make=
 things interesting and understandable by laymen. However, it is more fun t=
o explore the deeper meanings.

(2) Take Raktabeeja's slaying. Raktabeeja i=
s a demon with a special ability. If a drop of blood falls from his body on=
 the ground, another demon will be born from it and will be of the same siz=
e, age and strength as the original Raktabeeja even at birth. As Vaishnavi,=
 Maaheswari, Aindri etc were hurting Raktabeeja in the fight, more and more=
 demons were being born and all the gods were scared. Then Chandikaa told K=
aali to expand her face and eat all the demons as they are born. Chandika g=
oes around the war ground eating all the demons as they are born and eventu=
ally Raktabeeja runs out of blood.

This looks like a nice story. But, is t=
here is a deeper meaning in it that helps you in self-realization? Why was =
Kaali the chosen one and not Vaishnavi or Naarasimhi or Aindri?

The word r=
akta means blood. Another meaning is "desire/passion". The word comes from =
the root ranj/rang, which means "to color". Desire/passion/attachment color=
s and conditions the mind. Beeja means seed.

Raktabeeja means "the seed of=
 desire". Raktabeeja fighting with gods symbolizes desires taking the bette=
r of our good judgment and good qualities. Each human being is a microcosm =
of the macrocosm that the universe is. All devatas reside in us as various =
good qualities and all demons reside in us as various undesirable qualities=
. When we are overcome by desires and do bad deeds, the Raktabeeja within u=
s is defeating the gods within us.

The thing is that desires are difficult=
 to get rid of. You get rid of one desire and another desire is born. That =
is what Raktabeeja's special ability means. The "seed of desires" (i.e. bas=
ic attachment that is the nature of mind) within us will keep producing mor=
e and more desires. It is very resourceful.

Then, why Kaali to destroy Him=
?

In astrology, we associate Mahaakaala and Mahaakaali with Saturn. Kaali =
shows detachment and vairaagyam. She wears a garland of skulls, symbolizing=
 that there is an endless cycle (garland) of births a material form (skull)=
 goes thru. The way Kaali shows to overcome the cycle is vairaagyam and det=
achment. She shows meaningful and highest level of vairaagyam that comes wi=
th a deep understanding of the cycle of material forms.

To fully cut off t=
he "seed of desires" so that one does not get any more desires, one needs t=
o develop vairaagyam and detachment and keep on destroying desires as they =
are born and persist like that. After persisting for a long time, the "seed=
 of desires" will run out of desires and the basic attachment of mind will =
vanish.

Thus, simple stories have deep meanings. This particular story cel=
ebrates the value of detachment, vairaagyam and persistence - Saturnine qua=
lities.

*        *        *

Merely chanting Chandi saptashati without und=
erstanding the meaning is also excellent and produces results. Understandin=
g the meaning and marvelling at the power of the Mother makes one fearless =
and energetic and also give material benefits. Understanding the deeper mea=
nings and appreciating the True Nature of the Mother makes one realize one'=
s own true nature. It has various benefits at various levels of sadhana. It=
 is tough to exactly say what benefit it gives, as that depends on the evol=
ution level of sadhaka and his attitude. But, there is something in Chandip=
ath for everyone!

However, the highest purpose is self-knowledge and that =
is why Vedas are its swaroopam.

*        *        *

Towards the end, the =
11th chapter (titled "Naaraayani Stuti") describes gods praying to the Divi=
ne Mother after slaying all the demons. They address Her as "Naaraayani". T=
rimurthis symbolize the purest aspects of the three gunas. Vishnu is one of=
 them. He is of Sattva guna and sustains the creation. However, Narayana is=
 different. He is not Vishnu (contrast Narayana sooktam with Vishnu sooktam=
!). He is gunaateeta (above gunas/attributes). He is the Sahasraseersha and=
 Parama Purusha (Supreme Cosmic Being). Some people may validly describe th=
e same as Samba Sada Shiva also, but let us not argue about names. When we =
are essentially speaking about an entity that is beyond attributes, it is f=
oolish to argue about the name. After all, name too is an attribute that in=
tends to describe other attributes! Though great people gave different name=
s to Parama Purusha, the names essentially capture the nature of the *path*=
 those people took to experience the Parama Purusha rather than the nature =
of Parama Purusha, which is beyond names and attributes.

The bottomline is=
 that there is a Parama Purusha above the Trimurthis (Brahma, Vishnu and Sh=
iva). IF we call him Narayana, then Narayani is His energy and She is the r=
oot cause of all manifested creation.

Saptashati is about Narayani. It is =
about the inseparable root energy of the Supreme Cosmic Being who is the so=
urce of this entire universe. A small part of that root energy lies within =
us too. Because I said "small part", don't think it is small. Even a small =
percentage of infinity is still infinity. Though each of us is a microcosm =
of the macrocosm that the entire universe is, each of us is a complete and =
accurate replica of the entire universe. Think "poornamadah poornamidam" in=
 Vedic spirit! The purpose of all spiritual sadhana is realizing the true n=
ature of self. Chandipath can also be viewed from that perspective.

------=
-----------------------------------------------
 

Someone queried a while =
back on the meaning behind the story of Madhu Kaitabha. Here is a quick rep=
ly based on my limited understanding.

*        *        *

Madhu means hon=
ey. "Madhu keeta" means an insect of honey, i.e. honey bee. Madhu kaita mea=
ns belonging to honey bees. It can be the qualities or nature of honey bees=
. One of the meanings of "bha" is "having a similarity to". Thus, in my jud=
gment, "Madhu Kaitabha" means "having a semblance to the nature of honey be=
es".

*        *        *

Like I keep saying, Sanskrit is a fantastic lang=
uage. Sanskrit names selected by Rishis for expressing various concepts and=
 stories are very thoughtful. Depending on how deep one goes, there are man=
y meanings of the same word. Thus, Rishis expressed concepts that may have =
one meaning to a layman and a different meaning to one who is ready to unde=
rstand the deeper meaning! I salute to the wisdom of our Rishis!

I was say=
ing the same thing at Arsha Vidya Gurukulam last weekend. When somebody sai=
d at an open discussion that the idea is important and not the name, as the=
re are many names of the same thing in many languages, I made a quick point=
 about the value of Sanskrit names. I said that Sanskrit names have not one=
 meaning, but layers of meanings that can be understood based on the capabi=
lity of the reader. Rishis used this to hide some special meanings and to k=
eep some higher knowledge as secret, even though it is very much out there!=
 The example I gave was of bhava and pada. Parasara described bhavas (house=
s) and how to find their respective padas (arudha padas of houses) and said=
 that a bhava and its pada should be judged to see the matters of a house. =
Though he did not explain the difference between a bhava and its pada furth=
er and did not elucidate when to use which one, I said that the very choice=
 of names is a huge clue! Bhava, which is usually translated as a house, al=
so means "a thought/concept/feeling" and pada means "a symbol/word" used to=
 express a thought/concept. Thus, houses are to their arudha padas what tho=
ughts (bhavas) are to the words (padas) that attempt to express them. For e=
xample, if the 4th house shows one's happiness from vehicles, the pada of 4=
th house shows the tangible articles that attempt to throw light on one's h=
appiness from vehicles (e.g. the physical vehicle owned by one). Houses (bh=
avas) show intangible/internal aspects of a matter (just like thoughts insi=
de one's head), while their arudha padas show tangible/external aspects of =
a matter (just like the external words spoken that attempt to express the t=
houghts in the head). If you use the English words to translate Parasara, t=
his hidden meaning may be lost! So, I argued that Sanskrit names used by Ri=
shis are not like words in any language.

*        *        *

Anyway, let =
us come back to the Madhu Kaitabha story. As I said, Madhu Kaitabha means "=
having a semblance to the quality of honeybees". What is the quality of hon=
ey bees? Well, they keep working hard to accumulate the sweet honey! They a=
re not intelligent enough to think about any higher things in life. Thus, M=
adhu Kaitabha are an allegory to the quality within us which makes us work =
hard, like honeybees, with a single-minded focus on accumulating material c=
omforts. Like honeybees accumulate honey, we accumulate material objects an=
d spend whole life working hard doing just that.

Vishnu is a personificati=
on of the sattwa guna of the Parama Purusha (Universal/Absolute Being). Wit=
hin us, Vishnu is an allegory to the sattwa guna within us. Madhu Kaitabha =
were born from Vishnu's earwax when He was alseep. The ability to work hard=
 like a bee is not really a terrible thing. This ability is essentially bor=
n from the sattwa guna within us, when it is in deep slumber (i.e. sattwa g=
una covered by taamasi shakti, i.e. sattwa guna that "manifests" in a taama=
sik way).

There are so many good people in this world, who just spend thei=
r entire lives in honest labor like the honeybees and accumulate things for=
 themselves and others around them. Their sattwa is in deep sleep and Madhu=
 Kaitabha born from that asleep sattva are very much active.

The problem w=
ith this focus on hard work and accumulation of material objects is that it=
 keeps us away from supreme bliss. Madhu Kaitabha's attack on Brahma and Ve=
das is symbolic of that. Vedas symbolize the supreme and liberating knowled=
ge of self and Brahma, the carrier of Vedas, symbolizes the sadhana to achi=
eve the supreme knowledge. The focus on working like honeybees and accumula=
ting material objects tries to kills one's ability to do sadhana and obtain=
 supreme knowledge of self.

Vishnu battles Madhu Kaitabha for 5,000 years.=
 Devi Bhagavatam even describes that Vishnu wondered in the middle how to d=
efeat Madhu Kaitabha, as He finds them quite formidable! Even when the satt=
va in us awakens, it is difficult for it to overcome the formidable instinc=
t to lead the life of a honeybee and to accumulate the material objects for=
 oneself and others.

According to Parasara, thighs are seen from the 9th h=
ouse of dharma. The earthy element symbolizes the commitment and stability.=
 The fact that earthy element came from the thighs of Vishnu shows that it =
is the dharma of sattwa guna sustaining this universe that ensures that the=
re is commitment and stability in this creation.

Moreover, it is apt that =
someone born in the ears (3rd house) of Vishnu found end in the thighs (9th=
 house, i.e. 7th house of death from the 3rd house) of Vishnu! Similarly, B=
rahma, who is born from the navel (6th house) of Vishnu should naturally fi=
nd His end in the 12th house of Vishnu (feet/sleep), which is the 7th house=
 of death from the 6th house! That may be why Vishnu goes to sleep, when th=
ere is a change of Brahma.

Anyway, the instinct within us to keep accumula=
ting material objects like honey bees accumulate honey finds its end in the=
 dharma of the sattwa guna, i.e. when the sattwa guna within us follows its=
 dharma. Then we are fully awake spiritually. Naturally, the path to self-k=
nowledge becomes open then and Brahma becomes elated.

Thus, the story of M=
adhu-Kaitabha refers, allegorically, to the instinct most of us have toward=
s leading a "regular" life, working hard like honeybees and accumulating ob=
jects for self and others and how that instinct needs to be defeated by wak=
ing up the sattwa guna and allowing it to perform its dharma.

*        *  =
      *

Lest I am misunderstood, I need to clarify one thing. I am not say=
ing that these stories are not real. These stories ARE very much real. In f=
act, when a Yogi is able to transport consciousness (Kundalini) to a partic=
ular plane (chakra), He/She can vividly see these stories actually happenin=
g. The stories are as real as our own existence as beings made of flesh and=
 blood is, in the normal plane of consciousness.

What I am saying is that =
there is an allegorical link between various planes of consciousness. What =
is real in one plane of consciousness is an allegory in another plane of co=
nsciousness. If one is atleast capable of understanding a story as an alleg=
ory, that will serve a valuable purpose!

---------------------------------=

<A discussion on oneness and manyness of forms>

> Is=
 vishnu there in the flower? The answer is yes
> Is Vishnu there in the tre=
e? The answer is yes 

That's all fine. But a devotee of Kaali like Ramakri=
shna will eventually reach the stage where he sees Kaali in flowers, trees =
etc (just as you may aspire to see Vishnu in everything). A great devotee o=
f Shiva will eventually see Shiva in everything.

It is possible to devote =
to several deities and eventually start seeing the deity in everything that=
 exists. It is not correct that only Vishnu's form has the characteristic y=
ou explained above.

In order to explain this more clearly, let me go back =
to the analogy I gave earlier. This fantastic analogy is from my spiritual =
guru.

-------------- Quote Begin --------------
Imagine God to be a bright=
 star in the sky. When you see from a distance, star seems tiny and you con=
clude that there is only one God. If you start moving towards God, you real=
ize as you get closer that the star is in reality a huge diamond with 330 m=
illion faces. Each face is several miles long and wide and has various attr=
ibutes (gunas). One face may be red and hot and another may be blue and col=
d etc. So, as you get closer to the diamond, you have to pick one face to g=
et close to.

Now, when you get too close to a face, the whole world will s=
eem to have the attributes of that face. For example, if you get too close =
to a face that is cold and blue, then the whole world will feel cold and bl=
ue to you. In other words, the God you are getting close to is the Supreme =
god of the world and fills the entire world as you experience it.

This is =
the ultimate goal in sadhana for one adhering to Dwaita siddhanta (duality)=
. For them, getting close to ishta devata and securing a place near the fee=
t is the highest goal. Everything else is immaterial to them.

For some, th=
ere is a next stage: As you get closer and closer to the face you picked, y=
ou finally merge with it! This is the ultimate goal in sadhana for one adhe=
ring to Visishtaadwaita.

To Advaitis, this communion with a Saguna ("with =
attributes") form of God is not the final goal. The final goal is to break =
through the face and jump into the inside of the diamond. As you break thro=
ugh the face of the diamond into which you merge and jump into the interior=
 of the diamond, you no longer perceive the faces of the diamond or the wor=
ld outside. There are no longer any objects or attributes. The experiencer,=
 experienced and experience all merge into one.

This state can be achieved=
 by first merging into any face (Vishnu, Shiva, Mahalakshmi, Mahakali etc).=

-------------- Quote End --------------

Read the above analogy carefully.=
 Imagine Vishnu, Shiva etc to be faces of the diamond in the above analogy.=
 If you get too close to Vishnu, you will indeed see Vishnu in everything a=
nd you 'realize' that Vishnu is the supreme god of this universe and fills =
everything that exists. You see Vishnu in even Shiva. Similarly, if you get=
 too close to Shiva, you will indeed see Shiva in everything and you 'reali=
ze' that Shiva is the supreme god of this universe and fills everything tha=
t exists. You see Shiva in even Vishnu. The same applies to Sun, Ganesha an=
d so many other deities.

It is as simple as that.

But then, one may ask w=
hat is the importance of picking ishta devata based on chart. If it is poss=
ible to see Vishnu in Shiva or Shiva in Vishnu, what is the big deal in cho=
osing a deity? Why can't one pray to a random deity?

The answer is that th=
e stage of perceiving the ishta devata in all gods and everything that exis=
ts has not been reached by most people. Our ishta devata prescriptions are =
for people who are yet to reach that stage. In terms of my analogy, the jou=
rney to different faces of the diamond takes different times based on where=
 you stand right now. If you pick a face that is closest to you based on wh=
ere you are, you reach the diamond faster. For example, if you choose a fac=
e on the other side, it will take considerably longer to reach it. On the c=
ontrary, if you select a face that is closest to you, you reach it faster.
=

Similarly, if you choose a form (face of the diamond of divinity) that is =
closest to you based on where you stand in karmic evolution (i.e. based on =
all previous karmas and samskaras), you reach god faster. Once you reach th=
e chosen face and get too close to it, you will see that deity in the entir=
e universe. Someone with different samskaras may choose a different deity a=
nd reach a different face and that person will see that deity in the entire=
 universe. There is no contradiction here!

Thus, while trying to surrender=
 to a random deity may eventually work, surrendering to some specific deiti=
es may work faster based on your previous karmas. That is what astrologers =
should try to figure out. Instead of setting one on a different course, if =
we help one continue the course one was on already (from various lives), we=
 would have done a good thing!

Thus, my humble appeal is this: Let us not =
restrict to one deity (e.g. Vishnu and His avataras) based on OUR OWN samsk=
aras. Let us recommend all deities based on the native's inclination, samsk=
aras and karmas.

I hope my view on not prescribing only Vishnu's avataras =
as ishta devatas is better understood after this detailed mail!

"Naaraaya=

all t=
he demons. They address Her as "Naaraayani". Trimurthis symbolize the 
pure=
st aspects of the three gunas. Vishnu is one of them. He is of Sattva guna =

and sustains the creation. However, Narayana is different. He is not Vishn=
u 
(contrast Narayana sooktam with Vishnu sooktam!). He is gunaateeta (abov=
e 
gunas/attributes). He is the Sahasraseersha and Parama Purusha (Supreme =
Cosmic 
Being). Some people may validly describe the same as Samba Sada Shi=
va also, but 
let us not argue about names. When we are essentially speakin=
g about an entity 
that is beyond attributes, it is foolish to argue about =
the name. After all, 
name too is an attribute that intends to describe oth=

d. When somebody said at an open discussion that the idea

 not the name, as there are many names of the same thing in many

, I made a quick point about the value of Sanskrit names. I said that 
Sans=
krit names have not one meaning, but layers of meanings that can be 
unders=
tood based on the capability of the reader. Rishis used this to hide some 
=
special meanings and to keep some higher knowledge as secret, even though i=
t is 
very much out there! The example I gave was of bhava and pada. Parasa=
ra 
described bhavas (houses) and how to find their respective padas (arudh=
a padas 
of houses) and said that a bhava and its pada should be judged to =
see the 
matters of a house. Though he did not explain the difference betwe=
en a bhava and 
its pada further and did not elucidate when to use which on=
e, I said that the 
very choice of names is a huge clue! Bhava, which is us=
ually translated as a 
house, also means "a thought/concept/feeling" a=
nd pada means "a 
symbol/word" used to express a thought/concept. Thus, hou=
ses are to their arudha 
padas what thoughts (bhavas) are to the words (pad=
as) that attempt to express 
them. For example, if the 4th house shows one'=
s happiness from vehicles, the 
pada of 4th house shows the tangible articl=
es that attempt to throw light on 
one's happiness from vehicles (e.g. the =
physical vehicle owned by one). Houses 
(bhavas) show intangible/internal a=
spects of a matter (just like thoughts inside 
one's head), while their aru=
dha padas show tangible/external aspects of a matter 
(just like the extern=
al words spoken that attempt to express the thoughts in the 
head). If you =
use the English words to translate Parasara, this hidden meaning 
may be lo=
st! So, I argued that Sanskrit names used by Rishis are not like words 
in =
any language.</FONT></DIV>

<D=
IV><FONT face=3DArial color=3D#ff0000 size=3D2>Read the above analogy caref=
ully. 
Imagine Vishnu, Shiva etc to be faces of the diamond in the abo=
ve analogy. 
If you get too close to Vishnu, you will indeed see Vishnu in =
everything and you 
'realize' that Vishnu is the supreme god of this univer=
se and fills everything 
that exists. You see Vishnu in even Shiva. Similar=
ly, if you get too close to 
Shiva, you will indeed see Shiva in everything=
 and you 'realize' that Shiva is 
the supreme god of this universe and fill=
s everything that exists. You see Shiva 
in even Vishnu. The same applies t=
o Sun, Ganesha and so many other 
deities.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DA=

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>It is as=
 simple as that.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> =
;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>But then, one may ask what is the =
importance of 
picking ishta devata based on chart. If it is possible to se=
e Vishnu in Shiva or 
Shiva in Vishnu, what is the big deal in choosing a d=
eity? Why can't one pray to 
a random deity?</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=
=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>The =
answer is that the stage of perceiving the 
ishta devata in all gods and ev=
erything that exists has not been reached by most 
people. Our ishta devata=
 prescriptions are for people who are yet to reach that 
stage. In terms of=
 my analogy, the journey to different faces of the diamond 
takes different=
 times based on where you stand right now. If you pick a 
face that is=
 closest to you based on where you are, you reach the diamond 
faster. For =
example, if you choose a face on the other side, it will take 
considerably=
 longer to reach it. On the contrary, if you select a face that is 
closest=
 to you, you reach it faster.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2=
></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Similarly, if you cho=
ose a form (face of the 
diamond of divinity) that is closest to you based =
on where you stand in karmic 
evolution (i.e. based on all previous karmas =
and samskaras), you reach god 
faster. Once you reach the chosen face and g=
et too close to it, you will see 
that deity in the entire universe. S=
omeone with different samskaras may 
choose a different deity and reach a d=
ifferent face and that person will see 
that deity in the entire universe. =
There is no contradiction here!</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=
=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Thus, while tryin=
g to surrender to a random deity 
may eventually work, surrendering to some=
 specific deities may work faster based 
on your previous karmas. That is w=
hat astrologers should try to figure out. 
Instead of setting one on a diff=
erent course, if we help one continue the course 
one was on already (from =
various lives), we would have done a good 
thing!</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT f=

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>T=
hus, my humble appeal is this: Let us not restrict 
to one deity (e.g. Vish=
nu and His avataras) based on OUR OWN samskaras. Let us 
recommend all deit=
ies based on the native's inclination, samskaras and 
karmas.</FONT></DIV>
