Thats a fine phrase. "Nesting of consciousness." Similar to wha=

=C2=A0

=C2=A0
I have a different way of looking at it. Siddha=
 is one who has siddhis, those 
which appear when one is able to choose a s=
hakti near sahashrar, and/or bring 
the kundalini back to lower chakras aft=

Nirvikalpa, thus gaining some mastery o=
ver the world of duality.
=C2=A0

knowledge,=C2=A0does the cow exi=

=C2=A0
A siddha is one who has siddhis. (not just any siddhis, but on=

byproduct of a state).=C2=A0If he/she chooses to stay in=
 society, will someday or the 
other manifest externally his ability, consc=
iously or unconsciously. Not because 
he wants to, but because that is a na=
tural state of his being. If I keep a tiger 
at home, someday it will roar.=
 Not because it wants to display some magic, but 
that is what happens natu=
rally. 

=C2=A0
<<But that does NOT liberate one. One may get stuck for a l=
ong time.>>
=C2=A0
What is liberation? Are Rishis, the nine Naths (nav-nath=
s)=C2=A0liberated?=C2=A0 Is Lord 
Shiva 'stuck' or liberated? 

=C2=A0
This=
 is not like acquiring some ability at some chakra and the kundalini gettin=
g 
stuck there and not rising any more. We are talking of a state where the=
 
individual has already experienced Nirvikalpa samadhi=C2=A0for sufficient=
 time and 
then come back from there, on being "pulled by a higher force" f=
or some specific 
purpose of Nature. This is a very=C2=A0rare occurance. If=

=C2=A0
If you think that is still being 'stuck', all=
 I can say if we have an entirely 
different way of understanding the same =
reality
=C2=A0
A Siddha is a different phenomenon altogether. He is stuck -=
 if at all that word 
has to be used -=C2=A0to the extent that he is not pu=
lled into a more refined orbit 
and becomes a Nath or eventually a Rishi. B=
ut is he/she really stuck because he 
has not merged his/her existence into=
 the infinite? I disagree. That is easy for 
a siddha to do. Infact once a =
person experiences Nirvikalpa Samadhi 
sufficiently, he/she will 9 out of 1=
0 times merge into the infinite and cease to 
exist. It is that 1 out of 10=
 who may=C2=A0keep an individual existence and yet 
remain acutely realized=
=C2=A0of the universal reality.=C2=A0This happens only when Nature 
has a j=

=C2=A0

=C2=A0
There are three ways, they say, in which this stat=

the lower chakras (which allows 
mastery over these elements), (maybe these=
 two are related, I don't know) and/or

Agreed.=C2=

<<The issues o=

Yes, siddhis=C2=A0are not be pursued. For any nor=
mal=C2=A0sadhaka, the aim is to awaken 
Kundalini shakti and eventually, so=
me day, some lifetime, go to the state of 
Nirvikalpa. Till then, it is bes=
t never to crave, want, desire or work 
specifically=C2=A0for a super-natur=
al ability. Else one can get stuck.

But the Siddhi of a true=C2=A0Siddha h=
owever=C2=A0is an entirely different thing.=C2=A0He has 
already reached Ni=
rvikalpa Samadhi and stayed in that state for sufficient 
period of time. H=
is understanding of reality is permanently altered.=C2=A0His

re different. He is a instrument of higher purpose.

If I compare the chanc=
es of a sadhaka reaching the state of Nirvikalpa to the 
chances of a begga=

That remot=

=C2=A0
A few points:
=C2=A0
(1) You wrote earlier: "Vimalananda e=
ven goes to extent of mentioning a Nath may 
takes thousands of years of sa=
dhana to pulled into a Muni and similarly a Muni 
may take "billions" of ye=
ars of sadhana to become a Rishi."
=C2=A0
Now you are saying that rishis ar=
e "eternal" and can't have desires from past. 
You are contradicting yourse=
lf.
=C2=A0
(2) A rishi can of course have a "past life" or a "past" in curr=
ent life before 
"becoming" a rishi, where several desires may have arisen =
due to environment.
=C2=A0
(3) Saptarshis are indeed eternal. But even they=
 arise from Aadyaa (Initial 
One), i.e. the shakti of Supreme Cosmic Being.=
 When Supreme Cosmic Being and His 
Shakti arise from undivided pure consci=
ousness, so many desires/thoughts arise 
in them. Saptarshis who come from =
them implement those desires. They engage in a 
play by creating many unive=
rses, many Brahmas, many Vishnus, many Shivas, many 
Indras etc and all tha=
t is a reaction to the desire that was in their 
consciousness, inherited f=
rom the supreme being from whom they just arose, at 
time minus infinity.
=
=C2=A0
Yoga Vaasishtham gives many examples of nesting of consciousness and=
 how desires 
in one level of nesting impact the next level. That principle=
 applies here.
=C2=A0
Bottomline is that everything is a reaction to some a=
ction. The fruits we are 
receiving now are reactions to what we did as ind=
ividual beings with ego. These 
beings may have come from many levels of ne=
sting. We want to stop desiring 
things, be done with the fruits, trace bac=
k each level of nesting, and merge in 
the supreme cosmic being finally.

Whether you define siddhi as any supernormal=
 ability OR a truly special ability 
one gets by latching on to one of the =
petals of Sahasrara chakra, the bottomline 
is that you cannot judge who ha=

all, you cannot conclude who=
 has a Lombarghini car by checking who is driving 
one on the road. One may=
 have a Lombarghini in garage and not drive it while you 
are (any anybody =
is) watching.
=C2=A0
Higher siddhis come to one who is not keen on showing =
off. One uses them if and 
when a situation warrants it naturally. If Vivek=
ananda or someone is not 
recorded to have externally demonstrated a higher=
 siddhi, you cannot conclude he 
did not have any. My whole objection has b=
een to making *judgments* on others 
based on *external* factors.

When Kundalini is at Sahasrara, one may latch on to a=

There is no denial that what we understand from a spoken/written wor=

I want to clear a few misconc=

=C2=A0
(1) I do not have=
 any issue with Aghora books. I love them and I respect 
Vimalananda. In fa=

in fire, in =
a kalasha, in an 18-handed idol and in a framed portrait of 
Vimalananda.
=
=C2=A0
With no prejudice or malice, I simply think that the knowledge in th=

can be balanced by some literature on the other extreme.
=C2=A0

(2) I honestly do not care what you or someone else thinks of the staure of=
 
Vivekananda or even Ramakrishna, compared to Vimalananda. It hardly matte=
rs to 
me. I used it as an excuse to make some points. In fact, your compar=
ison may 
indeed be correct :-), though 2pwr16 is a huge exaggeration.
=C2=
=A0
(3) The issues of what siddhis are, how they come, whether one should a=
ctively 
pursue them, IS an important one. For SOME of the highly advanced =
sadhakas who 
got started with homam now, attitude towards siddhis may make=
 the difference 
between being liberated in this life vs having to wait a f=
ew more hundreds of 
thousands of years.

=C2=A0 
Before we go further, let us define what i=
s "siddhi" and what is a "siddha". 
Siddhi means accomplishment. That is wh=
y we used terms like mantra-siddhi 
(realizing a mantra), or some other app=
arently miraculous/supernatural ability. 
And the word siddha is often used=
 to describe someone who has some such ability. 

=C2=A0 
This definition o=
f a Siddha is incorrect. It is a corruption which has entered 
our thought-=
process over centuries, just like every other spiritual person who 
uses an=
 epithet Rishi is not really a Rishi. 

=C2=A0 
So who is a Siddha really? =
One who has acquired some miraculous ability? Nope. 
Technically a Siddha i=
s one who has taken his awareness (Kundalini) to the 
Sahashrar Chakra, thu=
s experiencing Nirvikalpa, and THEN bringing the awareness 
back to the low=
er chakras. In this process, he often acquires *degrees of 
mastery* over t=
he five elements of the chakras. That is a true Siddha. Aghora 
part 2 very=
 clearly defines, (same is also hinted at in some other books too), 
this i=
n much details. There is absolutely no scope of ambiguity here, unless one =

refuses to accept the book as valid (fine by me). Like it says, what is th=
e 
difference between a gyani and a vigyani? A gyani experiences the state =
of 
Nirvikalpa and realizes "All is Brahman". But it is one thing to realiz=
e "all is 
brahman", it is another thing to acquire some of the shaktis of =
Brahman. 

=C2=A0 
F or example, consider a glass of water and an ocean. Bo=
th of them have the same 
chemical compostion (H2O). Realizing this is real=
izing "all is Brahman". But an 
ocean can sustain and create a Tsunami, a g=
lass of water cannot, even if it 
wants to. Of course it may often never ha=
ve a desire to do so in the first 
place! However that is the difference, t=
echnically, between a gyani and a 
vi-gyani. And the whole process of a Sid=
dha and higher starts ONLY AFTER someone 
is able to bring the Kundalini ba=
ck from Sahashra chakra to the lower chakras 
again. Needless to say, for m=
ost of us ordinary people, even getting a Kundalini 
to awaken is a big dea=
l, taking it to Shahashrar is already too hi fi and may 
take lifetimes, br=
inging is back is impossible/unthinkable totally. 

=C2=A0 
What happens wh=
en a person becomes a Siddha by the parameter described above? It 
is impos=
sible to imagine. He/she operates from a plane of reference so different 
t=
hat ordinary folks just cannot fathom. Infact, most of us can't even fathom=
 
what samadhi feels like until experienced, what to speak of siddha-hood. =


=C2=A0 
__________________________________________ 
=C2=A0 
A Trilanga Sw=
ami did tri-khanda yogas, cuts his limbs, puts them into fire and 
eventual=

sidd=
hi (miraculous ability) or a sadhana? To us average folks, anything out of =

the ordinary seems miraculous. The internet itself would appear 
supernatu=
ral/miraculous a few centuries ago! 

=C2=A0 
Therefore, one who reaches a =
state of Siddha-hood, will automatically produce 
external effects which ap=
pear miraculous to ordinary people. Not like he/she is 
specifically trying=
 for it, but it is a byproduct of a totally different 
internal reference f=

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] One more key point (Re: On Siddhis & Spiritual P=

=C2=A0 
Namaste, 
=C2=A0 
An interesting point came up in a pri=
vate exchange with a couple of folks and I 
will write it down for the bene=
fit of others. 

=C2=A0 
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * 
=C2=A0 
It is not like "you get =
so & so siddhi when you reach so & so level". 
=C2=A0 
Siddhis come because=
 one DESIRED them in this or a PREVIOUS life. When one has 
made enough pro=
gress, Nature grants one's desires (or the ability to fulfil a 
group of de=
sires) and sees if that tempts one and one stops or one can progress 
furth=
er. 

=C2=A0 
So what siddhis one gets or does not get, is a function of (1=
) one's spiritual 
progress now AND (2) all of one's desires until now (in =
this life AND previous 
lives). At the same level of progress, two people m=
ay fare differently in terms 
of what they get, based on what kind of wishe=
s they entertained in the past. 

=C2=A0 
So siddhis cannot be used to meas=
ure one's progress. You cannot use reverse of 
f(x, y) to gauge x, without =
knowing y.

ote: 
=C2=A0 
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Namaste, 
=C2=A0 
The following is our main dis=
agreement and the real reason we are having this 
conversation: 

=C2=A0 
>=
 <<Siddhis are not a measure of one's spiritual progress and 
> neither nec=
essary nor sufficient for liberation.>> 
> 
> They maybe, or they may-not b=
e. Such blanket statements are incorrect 
> and gloss over nuances and crea=
te a totally wrong picture. 
=C2=A0 
What I said is not a "blanket statemen=
t", but an explicit teaching of Vasishtha 
to Rama in Yoga Vaasishtham. It =
is also absolutely consistent with Upanishadic 
learning. 

=C2=A0 
You tal=
k about taking the words of a great instead of speculating. In fact, did 
V=
imalananda *explicitly* write that Ramakrishna is only a "Paramahamsa" and =
not 
a siddha or a natha or a rishi, that Vivekananda is not a rishi or nat=
ha or 
siddha or paramahamsa, and so on? In my case, my statement above is =
explicitly 
and unambiguously stated by Vasishtha. By answering Vivekananda=
's question "will 
siddhis help me in god realization" in the negative, Ram=
akrishna also affirmed 
this teaching of Vasishtha. Krishna also essentiall=
y refers to the same thing in 
Bhagavad Gita when he talks about seeking sm=
all things from demigods vs seeking 
"me" (Self). Vaishtha's words, however=
, are the clearest and most unambiguous. 

=C2=A0 
Yoga Vaasishtham was tau=
ght by Vasishtha to Lord Rama in the presence of 
Vishwamitra and other gre=
at sages and recorded by Valmiki. It is the highest 
watermark of spiritual=
 knowledge. 

=C2=A0 
Aghora series is nice, but can give wrong notions to =
some who may tend to be 
fascinated by external miracles. I have no doubt t=
hat Vimalananda had no 
confusions himself, but some people reading those b=
ooks can form misconceptions 
(though it is still ok if that makes them do =
sadhana. The only problem is if 
they start doing the bad karma of making n=
egative judgments on greats thinking 
they are blindly following Vimalanand=
a). It is a good idea to balance the 
perspective with some Vedantic unders=
tanding such as Yoga Vasishtham or Bhagavad 
Gita. 

=C2=A0 
> Infact it al=
so violates a point which you yourself made in an earlier mail. The

ernally. 
=C2=A0 
Yes, some external siddhis are possible only at a very ra=
refied level of 
realization. But some with the same or higher level of rea=
lization may not 
possess the same external siddhi. Thus external miracles =
cannot be used as 
measures of one's level. 

=C2=A0 
This is like the anal=
ogy I gave of collecting fruits from the trees on the side 
of the road to =
the hilltop. Some keep tavelling on the road and accept only 
those fruits =
that land in their lap by themselves. Some get distracted from the 
journey=
 and pursue the fruits actively. Collecting fruits is neither necessary 
no=
r sufficient for reaching the top. Though having a fruit that is available =

only at a very high altitude shows that one has reached great altitude, it=
 
cannot be used as a measure of one's progress, for someone may have climb=
ed 
greater heights without collecting that (or any) fruit. 

=C2=A0 
Exter=
nal and internal do NOT have a one-to-one correspondence. Just as you 
cann=
ot tell what is inside a house by looking at it from outside, so cannot you=
 
tell one's state of mind from looking at one. One's spiritual maturity an=
d 
attainment is in one's state of mind.

=C2=A0 
When you =
said a while back, for example, that Vivekananda used to contradict 
himsel=
f, I agreed. The issue is not just "questioning" a "loved and revered 
spir=
itual figure". The issue is passing off what I see as needless, unjustified=

=C2=A0 
To get a bett=

Fatness is external and judgable. Internal things (e.g. A is =

shi, a projection of a 
Rishi. Not the Rishi is full. BTW, all of these Sid=
dhas, Naths, Munis etc are 
projection Rishis one way or the other. Each is=
 kept is ingorance of their real 
being (Rishi) such that the play can go o=
n (not my words, Vimalananda's words). 
They are Nitya-siddha because even =
if they take birth over and over, being parts 
of extremely higher beings, =
these emanations/projections/amsas will surely 
eventually go back to the s=
ource when the work is done. 

=C2=A0 
However, in their forms as specific =
individuals like Vivekananda, whether these 
amsa attain the specific stage=
s which makes a siddha/nath/muni/rishi will 
determine if they are to be ca=
lled so. They may not need to do so since they are 
here for a purpose. But=
, the only way a person can be called a siddha in true 
sense is when he, a=
s Vimalananda puts it, "picks a petal", (some specific 
shaktis) an "orbit"=
 and moves closer to the Centre and yet not merging into it, 
deeper and de=

=C2=A0 
There is a book of conversations between Totapuri and=
 a certain sadhaka (his 
disciple) when Totapuri lived in Puri. He used to =
stay in the Swargadwara 
smashana and later someone build a small ashram fo=
r him. Totapuri's ashram still 
exists in Puri. In that conversation, Totap=
uri also mentions a similar ideas of 
what is a siddha and higher. And how =
only a Siddha and none less is a true 
Vigyani. He further mentions that Sw=
ami Vivekananda did not (need) to go to the 
stage of a Siddha. His work wa=
s specific, he did the work and went off. He did 
not need to and therefore=
 did not become a Siddha. I see zero confusion here. 

=C2=A0 
Added to thi=
s the fact that Vivekananda was very clear, just as all the 
disciples of R=
amakrshna were clear, that Ramakrishna was a special spiritual 
being, and =
higher than them. Here too I see no confusion.

=C2=A0 
This is what I call a=

elevated. For =
Yogis, there maybe subtle differences and depths. The truth lies 
in the nu=

yours=
 on this matter. And my previous explanation actually clarifies this

Dear Narasimha, 
=C2=A0 
In the discussion that happened, he=
re is my stand, in case you have not 
understood the same properly: 

=C2=
=A0 
1) He was something special - which I cannot judge - because Manish sa=
ys so, and 
on THIS point I trust Manish's judgement more than your or mine=
. 

=C2=A0 
2) Some siddhis as you noted are special. Only very higher leve=

attain the same. Since the topic of siddhis did come up, Vima=
lananda's ability 
to suck up a ton of mercury by Vajroli and bring it out =
from his hair infront of 
someone of Vishudhananda's spiritual calibre, is =
not a easy feat. This is not a 
run-of-the-mill siddhi. 

=C2=A0 
3) I neve=
r compared Vimalananda with Ramakrishna, but with Ramakrishna's 
disciples.=
 That is a crucial difference.=C2=A0 My comparisons are always based NOT on=
 
my understanding, but clear words of great spiritual people. That is why =
I am 
100 perecent clear that Ramakrishna is spiritually higher than a Vive=
kananada or 
an Abhedananda. You may not want to judge them., thats your po=
int of view. I on 
the other hand would rather rely on the clear words of V=
ivekananda and 
Abhedananda on this matter rather than speculation. Both Vi=
vekananda and 
Abhedananda used to say Ramakrishna is their Guru and spirit=
ually far higher 
than they were. 

=C2=A0 
4) Whether Ramakrishna was a pa=
ramhamsa or a siddha in Vimalananda's scale is 
merely your speculation. Vi=
malananda's books however betray no such speculation. 
I would rather rely =
on the words of the book. 

=C2=A0 
5) In this age everyone likes to take a=
 title for himself. Many spiritual people 
name themselves Rishis, and we k=
now it they are not.=C2=A0 So the Nityananda 
comparison does not stand. Vi=
malananda on his part never used any titles, not 
even the term Guru. I bas=
e my judgement of this man on a) critical study of the 
books b) Manish's w=
ords. And I have not found you giving any sound logic for why 
I should cha=
nge the same. 

=C2=A0 
6) If you do not want to compare spiritual people, =
that is perfectly fine. I or 
anyone else is not forcing you. However, that=
 does not mean the world will not 
do so, specially when the great spiritua=
l people themselves have clearly done so 
on different occassions. Vivekana=

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] On Siddhis & Spiritual Progress=
 

=C2=A0 
Namaste friends, 
=C2=A0 
This is a small writeup on "siddhis" v=
is-a-vis spiritual progress, in reaction 
to further exchanges on Twitter. =
This is a delicate area where many have 
misconceptions and I will try to a=
ddress them. 

=C2=A0 
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * 
=C2=A0 
Maharshi Vasishtha's teachi=
ng to Lord Rama is clear in Yoga Vaasishtham. The 
goal of existence and sa=
dhana is self-realization. Siddhis are to be neither 
specifically sought n=
or specifically avoided, by a seeker of Self. If Nature 
gives one some sid=
dhi(s), one should accept them with neither excitement nor 
disappointment.=
 But one should NOT run after them, for they are neither 
necessary nor suf=
ficient for self-realization and liberation. 

=C2=A0 
Vivekananda used the=
 same principle when Ramakirishna proposed to give his 
siddhis to Vivekana=
nda. He asked whether the siddhis will enable him to realize 
god. Ramakris=
hna said no. Vivekananda firmly declined the offer then! Of course, 
when R=
amakrishna gave them anyway later, he accepted them. Vivekananda's two 
act=
ions demonstrate Vasishtha's instructions well. 

=C2=A0 
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * 
=
=C2=A0 
Let us use the analogy of climbing a hill. Climbing hill is one's s=
piritual 
sadhana. Reaching the top is liberation. Different people climb t=
he hill from 
different sides and using different paths. There may be trees=
 with nice fruits 
on the sides of the road. They are siddhis or special ab=
ilities. 

=C2=A0 
If one gets distracted, starts climbing the trees and co=
llecting fruits, one's 
journey gets delayed and one may not reach the top.=
 That is why Vasishtha says a 
seeker of Self does not pursue any siddhis. =


=C2=A0 
But if some fruits fall in one's lap by themselves, one can keep =
them. 
Similarly, siddhis that come to one by themselves can be accepted by=
 a seeker of 
Self. 

=C2=A0 
Now an important distinction: 
=C2=A0 
There =
are some trees that are found at lower altitudes also, but some really 
spe=
cial trees are found at very high altitudes only. If one has such a fruit, =
it 
shows that one has climbed great heights. Similarly, some siddhis do no=
t mean 
much, but some siddhis are very special and only really elevated sa=
dhakas can 
obtain them (whether by trying or without trying). If a sadhaka=
s demonstrates 
such a siddhi, you can see that one progressed a lot. Howev=
er, the key is that 
one who climbed the same or more distance may not have=
 that or any other fruit. 

=C2=A0 
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * 
=C2=A0 
Unlike in the=
 example of climbing hill, which is an external activity, spiritual 
progre=
ss in real life is *internal*. There is NO way for anyone to know for sure =

how much progress one has made, how much self-control one has internally a=
nd 
what exactly goes on in one's mind. We may try to judge it from externa=
l factors 
such as actions, words etc, but it is not necessarily accurate. =


=C2=A0 
Here, some people swayed by siddhis may be tempted to use one's s=
iddhis to judge 
how high one climbed. But that is faulty. One person who r=
eached the absolute 
top may not have any fruits, while one person who stil=
l has ways to climb may 
have gotten some really nice fruit. Using externas=
lly demonstrable siddhis that 
are neither necessary nor sufficient for Sel=
f-realization as a measure of one's 
progress is unsound. 

=C2=A0 
Given t=
hat spiritual progress is internal, how can we judge it and compare 
people=
 then? Well, we need not and should not. Only a sarvaantaryaami - a 
perfec=
ted being who has access to each being's internal state - can do that.

=C2=A0 
Rajarshi, you are assuming that Ramakrishn=
a Paramahamsa is a Paramahamsa on 
Vimalananda's scale. You are concluding =
that Ramakrishna is a Paramahamsa; 
Abhedananda, Vivekananda etc are lower =
than that; Vimalananda is a rishi; and 
hence Vimalananda is superior to Ab=
hedananda and Vivekananda by 2pwr16 to 2. 

=C2=A0 
Is Paramahamsa Nithyana=
nda, who was caught in a sex scandal, also a Paramahamsa 
because he is kno=
wn so? See, how people are famously known may or may not 
reflect their spi=
ritual stature. Real spiritual stature is internal and you 
cannot see it. =


=C2=A0 
We do not know who Ramakrishna Paramahamsa really is. He may not =
be just a 
paramahamsa on Vimalananda's scale, but be a siddha or a natha o=
r even a rishi. 
He may even be Vishnu himself, as he himself said and some=
 religious experts of 
that time declared based on various signs. If Ramakr=
ishna Paramahamsa is Vishnu 
himself, Vivekananda, Abhedananda etc can defi=
nitely be rishis or naths in 
Vimalananda's scale. If your argument is that=
 they cannot be because they did 
not demonstrate siddhis compatible with t=
hat status, that is a non-point as I 
explained above. The disagreement bet=
ween then boils down a difference in the 
relevance and importance of exter=
nally demonstrated siddhis.

=C2=A0 
Why this is r=
elevant and I spent some time on this is that some people seem to 
have mis=
conceptions. The take home for some people from some books describing 
mira=
cles and siddhis may be that siddhis are important. 

=C2=A0 
Vasishtha is =
not only a rishi, but one of saptarshis. Please read what he taught 
Lord R=
ama in Yoga Vaasishtham. It is the essence of Veda and Upanishad. It will 
=
balance your views and mould your attitude. Read Yoga Vaasishtham. Siddhis =
are 
neither necessary nor sufficient for self-realization. Don't be distra=
cted by 
them or be infatuated with them. 

=C2=A0 
The goal of sadhana is =
that your notions of "this is I and these are mine" get 
subtler and subtle=
r and hold of six internal enemies on you becomes weaker and 
weaker. Other=
s may or may not be able to see and judge your progress, but you 
know your=
