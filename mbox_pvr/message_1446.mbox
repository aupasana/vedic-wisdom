Namaste,

(1) He meant - 100 days at a stretch with these rules, with 10 malas a day. 
After 100 days, take a small break if needed and start another 100 days with 
the same rules. Do 3 times like this and see the difference internally.

(2) Yes, then continue counting afterwards.

(3) In unavoidable situations, stick to as many rules as possible and break 
only what is unavoidable.

(4) If beard cannot be grown, hair can be grown. Do not cut the hair during 
the time.

(5) That is what he was saying. Even 10 malas a day take a long time.

Actually, if someone who has free time does the same procedure with 
something like 30 malas a day, really tremendous things are almost 
guaranteed to happen to that person within a year. But Manish's advice was 
10 malas a day.

(6) Forget about all of that. Just think of Vishwamitra maharshi, Gayatri 
devi, Savitri devi and Savitaa for a second and start with the mantra.

Best regards,
Narasimha
