Dear Jacques, 
=C2=A0
Thank you for the nice advise! 
=C2=A0
I don't feel t=
he 'need' for it though! Fortunately.... It is only that sometimes I feel t=
hat it enhances my performance as a musician, although this is not a consis=
tent observation (so I could even be wrong here)! =C2=A0I am afraid of gett=
ing to a point where I start beleiving that alcohol is a must for performan=
ce, for I have seen so many super-fine teetotaller musicians!

Dear Nagraj:

If you f=
eel the need for alcohol to enhance your music, something is wrong. 

Try "=
The Artists' Way" by Julia Cameron. You will give up alcohol and become mor=
e creative if you actually practice the principles of the book. And in this=
 way you will become more deeply spiritual, as a creator. 

Regards, 

Jacq=

Namaste Narasimharaogaru, 
=C2=
=A0
Again a brilliant reply that clarified many questions. Now coming to Sa=
dhana on just one form of Almighty, I have a tough time choosing who. I lov=
e=C2=A0Mata Parvati=C2=A0as Mother, Shiva as Father, Gananatha and Karthike=
ya as my own siblings. I have such love for the family that I don't start m=
y day without praying to all the four! Daily I do abhishekham for a small S=
patika Lingam, in which I see both Shiva and Parvathi, I do ganapathi mantr=
a japam everyday and I recite Subramanya Karavalamba stotram. When I don't =
do it, it is not=C2=A0a day for me. ('Deva Devuni Chintinchu dinamu dinamu.=
..... .' !) And I get tears when I listen to Bhagavatam or Thyagaraja/Diksh=
ita r/Annamayya=C2=A0et al...=C2=A0Krithis. In spite of having won some rec=
ognition in my small community as a musician/vidwan, releasing a CD playing=
 my chosen instrument Veena, I cannot even sing some compositons some times=
 because of the overwhelming emotion. And those are some songs on Shiva, Pa=
rvati, Rama and
 Krishna. 
=C2=A0
But if I have to narrow down to one name,=
 I don't know how and how to leave any one form! Anyway, that apart, I did =
Gayatri Sadhana for sometime now and want to continue someday in the method=
 you/Manishji suggested, like the hundred day diksha! I don't know when the=
 time will come for that! I don't know if it is good to announce the mantra=
 that I practise, contrary to Sri Vimalananda' s advice, but again.. oh wel=
l!... 
=C2=A0
In the meanwhile my Sadhana of=C2=A0Ganapathi homam on Sunday=
s,=C2=A0nitya pooja everyday=C2=A0are=C2=A0continuing, by God's grace! But =
then they are eating into my music practise time! Again, the=C2=A0positive =
side is, when I practise these days, the practise is so much more rewarding=
... .......! I cannot express it well here........ .....
=C2=A0
BTW, Since =
this group is such an understanding group and=C2=A0one that always gives a =
positive energy, I want to confess something here. I have a weakness for al=
coholic drinks, that I take almost every weekend, because of the kind of co=
mpany I have here.=C2=A0Although over-indulgence in that sometimes weakens =
my resolve to do any kind of Sadhanas,=C2=A0my normal weekend poojas/daily =
poojas/music practise=C2=A0do not suffer at all because of this. In fact so=
metimes, I feel that I perform my music much better with a couple of Drinks=
 than without - Although this is such a shame=C2=A0tand=C2=A0opposite to wh=

=C2=A0
I want an=
 advice from the group=C2=A0about=C2=A0this and=C2=A0want to know if it is =

Thanks to everyone for readi=

Namaste Nagraj garu,

If one goes =
in the path of a tornado, aware or unaware that a tornado is coming, one wi=
ll still be consumed by it.

If the question is of fairness, well, is it fa=
ir that tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes etc should kill thousands of peo=
ple every year? Well, Natural order of the universe is neither fair nor unf=
air. It is just an "order". Your actions gets opposite reactions. You exper=
ience the fruits of your actions, as determined by the order of nature. A p=
erson may happen to be doing what he sees as his dharma and earthquake may =
strike there and kill him. If so, there must be a previous karma as a resul=
t of which he is placed there at that time.

In the case of the priest in t=
he story, his mistake is that he slapped a person worshipping god. If he ha=
d no way of assessing the bhava (feeling) in the mind of the person doing t=
he worship, he should've given the benefit of doubt and assumed it was a si=
ncere devotee, rather than assuming it was a fool.

See, when Ramakrishna w=
ent there and saw Trilinga Swami, he immediately knew the stature and remar=
ked that this is Viswanatha himself. However, others may not be so fortunat=
e. You only saw a body with some body parts and some clothes and nothing be=
yond it. If so, give the benefit of doubt and treat kindly and respectfully=
. Just because of external parameters, do not judge a person and act harsh.=


Hitting a person who still has a limited self-identification is one thing=
 and hitting a person who has no limited self-identification and identifies=
 with the entire universe or with a deity is different.

* * *

In any case=
, do not worry about that priest that much. For all you know, he may be an =
associate of Shiva who came along with Trilinga Swami to enact a story and =
teach a moral and he may have gone back to Shiva. Even if not, he was lucky=
 to enact an important role in an interesting divine drama.

* * *

Jeevanm=
uktas may engage in actions that are difficult to comprehend. They have no =
personal ego, will and agenda. They become instruments for Nature to fulfil=
 the Natural order. The action of Trilinga Swami may help several people qu=
estion, challenge and overcome their biases and learn some important lesson=
s, centuries after he left earth.

* * *

Regarding many gods: As I keep em=
phasizing, yogis and saints sometimes give advices based on desa-kaala-paat=
ra or advices geared at a specific set of people.

There is nothing wrong i=
n having many deities in pooja room and worshipping all. Such people may le=
ad fruitful dharmik lives. However, Vimalananda may not be concerned about =
such people. His teachings may be addressed at some other people to come in=
 the coming years who he has rina with and who are meant to achieve saayujy=
a of some deities and do some work. There is an intended audience for every=
 work and no work can be perfect for all audience.

If the goal is either l=
iberation or a deity's darshan (vision) or saayujya (company), one has to a=
gree that focusing on one deity is the best thing to do, rather than trying=
 to focus mind on ten deities and keep switching. A deity comes when mind a=
nd its thoughts are filled with that deity's name and mantra and other thou=
ghts are driven away from the mind. Vimalananda perhaps wanted to motivate =
several people to strive for vision/company of deities. He probably thought=
 some people he has a rina with would come to earth with such a potential.
=

* * *

Thyagaraja did compose songs on many deities. But, he first had a d=
arshan of Rama. He spent several years chanting Rama's name and had a darsh=
an. Then he composed songs on many deities. However, he saw all of them as =
different emanations from Rama. He saw Rama in all.

Same with Aadi Shankar=
a, Muththuswamy Deekshitar, Bammera Pothana and others.

When one achieves =
perfection in surrender to one deity, one's life is made. After that, one w=
ill see the same deity in all deities even if he worships 100 deities. If o=
ne is switching between ten deities before that, it may not be helpful in f=
illing the mind with thoughts of any of those deities. Mind sees those deit=
ies as different objects and may not fully surrender to any of them. Still,=
 as I said, one may lead a fruitful dhaarmik life. That's fine.

But, if yo=
u really want to taste the nectar of complete surrender, it is better to pi=
ck one deity and fill the mind with his/her thoughts.

* * *

Though I had some spiritual experiences fortunately, I am not =
a realized person. I too am a normal person with an immature mind. But my g=
uru blessed me that I will be able to give excellent replies to spiritual q=
uestions if I think of him and then write what comes to my mind. That is wh=
