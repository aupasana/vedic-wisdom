Namaste,
 
For those who do not realize it, the word "Swamiji" in the first=
 episode with a rupee note under the pillow refers to Swami Vivekananda (Na=
rendranath Datta then).
 
The person in the second episode below is Swami Y=
ogananda (Jogindra Nath Roy Chaudhury). However, this incident did not happ=
en the first time Jogin met Ramakrishna. The first time Jogin met Ramakrish=
na, he left quickly but decided to meet again. After meeting Ramakrishna se=
veral times, Jogin decided to spend a night with him and serve if needed. S=
o he stayed over one night. That is when the incident happened.
 
Jogin was=
 a light sleeper and woke up in the middle of the night. He found Ramakrish=
na missing in his bed. He went and checked at the water pot and looked outs=
ide to see if Ramakrishna was walking outside. When he did not find, then h=
e suspected "may be he teaches us about brahmacharya (celibacy), but goes t=
o his wife secretly in the night". He positioned himself outside the nahaba=
t (where Sarada Mata lived) and watched the door carefully. Later he heard =
the chattering of slippers from Panchavati on the other side and found Rama=
krishna approaching him. Ramakrishna first asked "what are you doing here".=
 When Jogin was silent and had an expression of shame on his face, Ramakris=
hna calmly said "well, you are right to test me. You should test a saint by=
 the day and night before believing in him." Of course, Jogin was ashamed a=
nd did not sleep the whole night.
 
*        *        *
 
I too suspected m=
y guru a few times like Jogin and questioned him. He too never took offense=
. I will describe one such incident.
 
Once he told me that he "saw" me ear=
lier in the day when he was driving on a highway in UK. He apparently "saw"=
 me doing homam at my house in US. He said he lifted his hand while driving=
, as if blessing me. His wife sitting next to him asked what he was doing i=
n the middle of driving at a high speed on a highway. When he told her "Nar=
asimha is doing a homam right now and I am blessing him", she thought he wa=
s being crazy.
 
When he described this incident, I immediately knew of a w=
ay to find out if he was being truthful. When I do homam, I normally wear a=
 veshti of white or red or yellow color. On that day, I was wearing somethi=
ng I very rarely wear and it would be nearly impossible to get it right wit=
h a random guess. I asked him "can I test you and verify if you really saw =
me". He said "ok, let us see". Then I asked him "what was I wearing when do=
ing homam this morning". He said, "It seemed like you were wearing some str=
ange kind of blue color veshi and a shirt of a different shade of blue colo=
r."
 
He was absolutely correct. I used my blue veshti only twice so far an=
d that day was one of the two days. What I was wearing on that day for homa=
m was something I rarely wear and difficult to just guess. So it is very ve=
ry likely that he indeed saw me doing homam on that day.
 
*        *      =
  *
 
Of course, siddhis like divya drishti (seeing things far away mentall=
y) are irrelevant. I am not interested in them at all. My guru teaches "wha=
tever abilities we need for our work will be given by the Mother. We should=
 not desire anything and at the same time not reject anything given by Her.=
 Our only desire should be to remain at Her feet always and to remember to =
desire that always. Rest of the things will come and go as She wants us to =
do various things. Leave it to Her and go with the flow without resisting a=
nd feeling emotions like pride or shame, happiness or sadness etc."
 
I bel=
ieve that my impulse to test my guru at that instant came only because my g=
uru (and the Mother) wanted me to do so, because there is some reason for t=
hat. Though it seems like I suspected my guru, I have a lot of faith in him=
 and in the Mother and think that I am used as an instrument by them to do =
the work they want done, including testing guru with temporary suspicion. I=
 am an unsuspecting playmate in their Play. I will not be surprised if Jogi=
n also felt the same way later, after testing Ramakrishna. But his action t=
aught something to others (even today!). That is perhaps why Ramakrishna an=
d Kali used Jogin as an instrument in their Play.
 
*        *        *
 
I=
n the example of money under Ramakrishna's pillow, how did he know it? Did =
he have all kinds of super-natural abilities? May be. But there is another =
way to look at it. He was a pure soul and the Mother devised a divine play =
to demonstrate his purity. It was the Mother's divine play that Naren shoul=
d get an impulse to test Ramakrishna, Ramakrishna should get an impulse to =
run away from the bed and pass the test and it should inspire some people i=
n future.
 
It is foolish to go after anything other than getting a perfect=
 sense of surrender and devotion to the chosen deity. If that comes, everyt=
hing needed for what one is supposed to do in the world is provided by the =
chosen deity. No pride and no shame, no happiness and no sadness, no excite=
ment and no depression, no attraction and no repulsion - one becomes a chil=
d and a playmate in the Divine play of the chosen deity. ALL that is needed=
 is a perfect sense of surrender. Ramakrishna had it. Nature composed sever=
al beautiful plays involving him and attracted the other actors of that pla=
y towards him.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

        Dear Narasimhaji

        Another wonderful mail. Everyday when I =
open my mailbox in the morning, I keep searching for your mails. Each one i=
s an inspiration.

        One more point I would like to add, I had read s=
ome books on Thakur in Bengali and in one there was the description of an i=
ndicident. Once Swamiji wanted to test Thakur. Since Thakur used to say tha=
t he could not handle money (as it represented something grossly material),=
 Swamji deliberately put a note under Thakur's pillow when Thakur was not i=
n the room. Later when Thakur come to sleep in teh bed, he instantly got up=
 as if in pain and said something is very wrong in here, Hriday, who was us=
ed to be there, searched the bed and found that money under his pillow. But=
 Thakur never got offended with these things.

        Infact in one instan=
ce, when one of his disciples had come to him for the first time, Thakur as=
ked him to stay over at Dakshineshwar. At night the disciple woke up and sa=
w that Thakur was leaving the room. A doubt entered the disciples mind, he =
thought maybe Thakur is goinfg towards the Nahabat house where Sri Sarada M=
a used to stay. So he quitely decided to follow Thakur and see where he is =
going, after all it maybe that Thakur used to visit the Nahabat secretly et=
c etc.. he was genuinely suspicious. Then as he left the room following Tha=
kur at a distance, he saw Thakur going to the Panchvati and sitting down fo=
r meditation and there he sat for two hours.Later when Thakur came back, he=
 told that person, who later became his disciple, that he had done very goo=
d to test Thakur. Further Thakur said, no one should accept a Guru without =
testing. And to see and judge a person's sprittuality he has to be observed=
 when he is public and when he is alone. There should be no diference in hi=
s words and actions. Etc etc.

        Every incident in Thakur's life is l=
ike an illustration of a deeper point for ordianry people like us.

          Dear Lakshmi,
=

          This is Kali yuga. While a really spiritual person must continuo=
usly try to destroy ego, so many spiritual gurus are there around us with b=
loated egos which are easily offended at a hint of criticism or overly exci=
ted at sycophancy. Such gurus are not of much use.

          But how do se=
parate the grains from the chaff? It is not easy, especially when there are=
 just a few grains in the middle of a big pile of chaff. Astrology is usefu=
l but not that much. Astrologer's mind, which makes the final judgments, wo=
rks based on his/her prejudices and secret beliefs.

          *        *  =
      *

          In the past, many great souls used intellectual discrimi=
nation and intuition to judge one's guru for a long time before whole-heart=
edly embracing one's guru. In many traditions within Hinduism, this is enco=
uraged. You do not accept a guru in an impulse. You "test" your guru and ta=
ke your time to accept him. But, once you accept a person as your guru, you=
 follow him faithfully.

          *        *        *

          If you ta=
ke Narendra (Swami Vivekananda) , the celebrated disciple of Ramakrishna Pa=
ramahamsa, he was a highly rational and skeptical young man. Though Ramakri=
shna had induced a samadhi in Narendra by mere touch in their second meetin=
g itself, it was not enough to convince Narendra of Ramakrishna' s ability =
and purity. He thought the whole experience could just have been a hallucin=
ation/ hypnotism and did not jump to any conclusion. As he visited Ramakris=
hna continuously, received love and knowledge from him and saw that Ramakri=
shna indeed walked the walk (as opposed to just talking the talk), he was s=
lowly convinced of the purity of Ramakrishna. He then became a tireless sol=
dier who dedicated his life to carrying out the mission of his guru!

     =
     During the early stages, he even told Ramakrishna bluntly about the la=
tter's visions of Kali, Krishna, Rama etc, "Sir, they could all just be you=
r imaginations or hallucinations" . Narendra did not even believe in god wi=
th a form and believed only in the formless. Ramakrishna was never offended=
 at these comments.

          Other sishyas like Joginder (Swami Yogananda=
) also approached Ramakrishna skeptically and tested him for a duration. Th=
ese young men who surrounded Ramakrishna weren't blind men led by a blind m=
an. They were all rishis or associates of rishis, who were reborn together =
for a purpose.

          They observed Ramakrishna for a while, confirmed =
that he practiced what he preached and realized that there was a valuable l=
esson in each action and word of his. They took a while to realize his puri=
ty and divinity, but once they realized they became faithful sishyas. He ac=
cepted them, loved them and taught them even before they realized his true =
nature and accepted him fully as their guru. He knew they were skeptical an=
d testing him, but he was never offended (what good is a guru who cannot re=
cognize a worthy student and what good is a guru whose ego is insulted at s=
omeone's skepticism). Once they accepted him and became faithful sishyas, e=
ach one of them was also transformed into a really pure person who takes th=
e entire life as a sadhana and maintains purity in every thought and action=
. Each sishya of a Ramakrishna was a role model in spiritual purity.

     =
     *        *        *
            
          One whose rinas draw one to=
wards a fake guru gets such a guru because that is what his karmas entitle =
him to. The circumstances we have to face are based on the previous actions=
. But the current action (freewill) is in our hands. If one can truly belie=
ve from the deepest cores of heart that one's guru is pure and like Shiva h=
imself, follows guru blindly and entertains no doubt whatsoever, that WILL =
pay off oneday. Nature WILL bring light into that person's spiritual life. =
It is just a matter of time.

          Thus, I will not be judgmental abou=
t other gurus and their sishyas. If a sishya believes in his/her guru fully=
, so be it. It is not our business.

          But, if one were to find a g=
uru like Ramakrishna Paramahamsa or Ramana Maharshi or Sri Aurobindo or Sri=
la Prabhupada, it is one's immense luck. However, the point I want to make =
is that having a great guru is not a guarantee of success and also having a=
 fake guru is not a guarantee of failure!

          At the end of the day,=
 the measure of success in any sadhana is the purity generated by that sadh=
ana. The measure of the purity is the effacement of ego. If ego is reduced =
completely or eliminated, one is making progress. This can happen inspite o=
f who is the guru, what one is doing etc.

          When the full grace of=
 the Supreme Being falls on a person, any medium is sufficient to reflect t=
hat grace.

          Best regards,
          Narasimha

   =
         Sorry I got my people and lineages all confused! Was reading about=
 too many people lately.

            Also last night  I saw a  documentary=
 on religious leaders, cults etc.
            People want to see God so bad=
ly they are very eager to push anyone who is willing to claim to be special=
 up on a pedestal.That happened with my ex , he got up there,felt it wasn't=
 right and tried to climb down, but his"disciples" didn't want him to.
    =
        They continued to perpetuate falsehoods about his purity, and all s=
orts of cover ups.
            God and Jesus are living in some many places=
. Sometimes there are several people simultaneously claiming to be Jesus in=
 any psych unit across the world/
            Its amazing where and to with=
in whom people see "God".
            Isnt a spiritual master, guru, living=
 like a mortal in all capacities while telling others how to find realizati=
on sort of hypocritical and bizarre?

            There is one fellow who u=
sed to be a heroin addict and now he says he is Jesus and has a huge follow=
ing. they are willing to do whatever he says and they give him money and al=
l sorts of things.
            Yesterday I went on the Internet, and looked=
 at some many so called yogis, preachers etc
            IN the USA I cant =
begin to tell you the number of religious leaders that were revered as "God=
" or some other incarnation.
            India is no different, perhaps wor=
se because people have a natural respect for sadhus , yogis etc and more yo=
gis can get away with pretending to be a renunciate.
            I believe =
God appears in different forms in different places and times to attract peo=

          =
  Now that Documentary TV program and your posts got my mind swimming.
    =
        What are principles of religion? What is dharma, What is the purpos=
e?
            Now if there were no laws or rules, social or religious and =
everyone did what they felt like, we would be living in a hell. At least in=
 Kali Yuga.
            What was the point of Jesus? Seems he got a lot of =
uncivilized people to work on basic codes of conduct... thou shalt not stea=
l,lie, commit adultery etc.
            Whose to say one person is a saint?=
.. some people(his faithful followers) couldn't understand that Charles Man=

            There are other "yogis" who ca=

            and other ones advised ha=

            Some people ADVOCate mandato=

            In itself, being able to perform siddh=

     =
             I meant it figuratively.

                  For the reference =
on Yogananda, you can read the section on Swami Yogananda in "God Lived wit=
h Them: Life Stories of Sixteen Monastic Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna" by S=
wami Chetanananda.

                =
  There have been many great yogis, babas, saints and swamis in the last fe=
w thousand years of Kali yuga. But Ramakrishna Paramahamsa stands out in on=
e way. He is one master who mastered every single path. He mastered bhakti =
yoga, jnaana yoga, karma yoga and even raaja yoga. He worshipped and experi=
enced Rama, Krishna, Kaali and several forms. He even reached the state of =
nirvikalpa samadhi, where there is no "experience" . He was in sahaja samad=
hi always. He was able induce tremendous experience in people by mere touch=
 or mere look. Yet he was simple like a child and had zero ego (that is why=
 he could do all that!!!).

                  Many "gurus" force their dhar=
ma on their sishyas and have no ability to recognize the true nature and dh=
arma of each sishya. They force sishyas to chant the mantra they chant, wor=
ship the form they worship and walk the path they walk. Ramakrishna had dee=
p insight into the true nature of each sishya and gave specific instruction=
s. He taught totally different mantras, totally different forms and totally=
 different paths to different sishyas. He even taught contradictory things =
to different sishyas. When one sishya who needed to mend his aggressive att=
itude roughed up somebody for insulting his guru, he scolded "shame on you.=
 With your attitude, you did not defend your guru, but brought shame to him=
. You should learn to be calm and ignore such insults. THAT will place your=
 guru in a good stead and not your aggression". When another sishya who nee=
ded to mend his soft demeanor ignored insults of Ramakrishna by some people=
 and came away silently, he scolded him "shame on you. Shastras say that yo=
u should kill one who insults your guru. How can you ignore such wrong beha=
vior? You should give them a piece of your mind."

                  Spirit=
ual sadhana does not mean just chanting a mantra or repeating a procedure e=
veryday for a certain period of time. Spiritual sadhana is a continuous pro=
cess by which one transforms oneself from inside out and purifies oneself. =
That way, every action and every thought becomes a sadhana and offers an op=
portunity for introspection and transformation of internal attitude.

     =
             Anyway, coming back to the point, Ramakrishna is not a normal =
sadhaka or a normal guru. He belonged to a very special class of sadhakas a=
nd he was an exceptional guru to an exceptional group of sishyas.

        =
          Without his [indirect] blessings, I would be a nobody and would b=
e lower than dirt. I would not be able to say anything intelligent or meani=
ngful in spiritual matters. Those who are impressed/inspired by something I=
 write should be thankful to my guru Dr Manish Pandit and to Sri Ramakrishn=
a for showering their grace using me as an instrument and not to me.

     =
             BTW, you are all free to forward my posts that you like to peo=
ple who may be interested in spiritual discussions. I have no problem. As I=
 said before, I am a servant distributing the wealth of a king (Mother) as =
asked by the minister (my guru).

                            At the time of Mahabharata war, it was A=
rjuna's dharma to kill his gurus, 
                            elders and r=

                            said), his dharma based on the time and pl=

                The tricky question is: How does one decide what is one's d=
harma?

                            Some people have interpreted Krishna's =
words saying "follow your own dharma 
                            and not s=
omeone else's dharma" in the light of castism. Though the concept 
        =
                    of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long =
time, the concept of 
                            caste mobility was very m=
uch there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by 
                            k=
illing birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was a =

                            kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a bra=
hmana and and a maharshi 
                            later. Basically varn=
a shows one's aptitude. One starts off with the varna 
                    =
        of father, because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As =
one 
                            develops in life, one gets one's own varna=
 based on what one does.

                            Thus, the misinterpre=
tation of Krishna's words which tells you to know your 
                   =
         dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dh=
armas in 
                            the world. Each person has individual=
 dharma.

                            Knowing what one's dharma is is very =
very very difficult. If one is pure 
                            enough, on=
e will *know* one's dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our 
        =
                    mind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is surrou=
nded by a lot of 
                            noise from other parts of our=
 minds which tell other things. Thus, we get 
                            c=
onfused.

                            We should make the best judgment comb=
ining discrimination and intuition and 
                            decide =
what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, but doing 
     =
                       the best we can is all that we can do!

            =
                More than following dharma, what is of utmost importance is=
 to engage in 
                            actions without identification. =
*That* alone ensures that we are not 
                            accumulat=
ing new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not build 
        =
                    too much attachment to what we are doing. We should eng=
age in the best 
                            possible actions (based on our=
 best judgment on what our dharma in the given

 situation is), with as little attachment and self-identification with the =

                            action as possible. When the action is finishe=
d, we should leave the result 
                            to god. We shoul=
d not think "I did it", "what will happen now", "will it

           work" etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication thr=
ough 
                            untached action) will simplify our ego an=
d purify our consciousness slowly. 
                            As we becom=
e purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma clearer. 
         =
                   There is a positive feedback here. This will slowly enab=

without incurring new karmas. This is not easy, 
                          =
  but not as difficult as people think.

                            The bo=
ttomline is: Even if one is not following one's dharma, one's sense of 
   =
                         "this is my dharma" gets refined with time if one =
engages in action with

incerely.

                            When Arjuna was confused about what =

he did not find, then he suspected "may be he tea=

outside the nahabat (where Sarada Mat=
a lived) and watched the door 
carefully. Later he heard the chattering of =
slippers from Panchavati on the 
other side and found Ramakrishna approachi=

are you doing here". When Jogin was =
silent and had an expression of shame on his

 "well, you are right to test me. You should test a

<FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
        <DIV>One more point=
 I would like to add, I had read some books on Thakur 
        in Bengali a=
nd in one there was the description of an indicident. Once 
        Swamiji=
 wanted to test Thakur. Since Thakur used to say that he could 
        not=
 handle money (as it represented something grossly material), Swamji 
     =
   deliberately put a note under Thakur's pillow when Thakur was not in the=
 
        room. Later when Thakur come to sleep in teh bed, he instantly go=
t up as 
        if in pain and said something is very wrong in here, Hrida=
y, who was 
        used to be there, searched the bed and found that money=
 under his 
        pillow. But Thakur never got offended with these things=
.</DIV>
        <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
      =
  <DIV>Infact in one instance, when one of his disciples had come to him 
 =
       for the first time, Thakur asked him to stay over at Dakshineshwar. =
At 
        night the disciple woke up and saw that Thakur was leaving the =
room. A 
        doubt entered the disciples mind, he thought maybe Thakur =
is goinfg 
        towards the Nahabat house where Sri Sarada Ma used to st=
ay. So he 
        quitely decided to follow Thakur and see where he is goi=
ng, after all it 
        maybe that Thakur used to visit the Nahabat secre=
tly etc etc.. he was 
        genuinely suspicious. Then as he left the roo=
m following Thakur at a 
        distance, he saw Thakur going to the Panch=
vati and sitting down for 
        meditation and there he sat for two hour=
s.Later when Thakur came back, 
        he told that person, who later beca=
me his disciple, that he had done 
        very good to test Thakur. Furthe=
r Thakur said, no one should accept a 
        Guru without testing. And to=
 see and judge a person's sprittuality he 
        has to be observed when =
he is public and when he is alone. There should 
        be no diference in=
 his words and actions. Etc etc.</DIV>

          The circumstances we have to face are=
 based on the previous actions. 
          But the current action (freewill=
) is in our hands. If one can truly 
          believe from the deepest cor=
es of heart that one's guru is pure and 
          like Shiva himself, foll=
ows guru blindly and entertains no doubt 
          whatsoever, that WILL p=
ay off oneday. Nature WILL bring light into 
          that person's spirit=
ual life. It is just a matter of 
time.</FONT></DIV>

 if one were to find a guru like 
          Ramakrishna Paramahamsa or Rama=
na Maharshi or Sri Aurobindo or Srila 
          Prabhupada, it is one's im=
mense luck. However, the point I want to 
          make is that having a g=
reat guru is not a guarantee of success and 
          also having a fake g=

          success in any sadha=
na is the purity generated by that sadhana. The 
          measure of the p=
urity is the effacement of ego. If ego is reduced 
          completely or =
eliminated, one is making progress. This can happen 
          inspite of w=
