Namaste Hari,
 
One who has been to Maharashtra and tasted the Alphonso mango may swear that Alphonso is the only real mango. One who has been to Andhra and tasted the Banginapalli mango may swear that Banginapalli is the only real mango. One who has been to north India and tasted the Dussehri mango may swear that Dussehri is the only real mango.
 
But, what about one who lives elsewhere in India and has not tasted any of these mangoes? He may eat some other locally available mango, which may also be tasty though not as good as these three. In fact, people living in US may have to be contented with Champagne mangoes from Mexico.
 
Similarly, there are many Gayatri mantras in Veda as it is available to us, including the popular Savitru Gayatri mantra that is simply known as Gayatri mantra. There may be other mantras that are not available to the public and revealed to one only when one makes progress and experiences a particular state.
 
If you have access only to a Kesar mango or Champagne mango, just enjoy it and don't compare it to something that you have no access to!
 
The Savitru Gayatri mantra is powerful too. Otherwise, why would Maharshi Viswamitra bother to reveal it to the world and why would so many people use it?
 
Most of what I experienced and realized came from sadhana with Savitru Gayatri mantra. I have no doubt that it is useful and sufficient.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
