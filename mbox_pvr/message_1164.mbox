Namaste,
 
Do your best and do not worry about the rest.
 
When everything =
- pronunciation, intonation, thoughts, mental images, surrender, dedication=
, procedure, external factors (place, surroundings and time) etc - lines up=
 nicely, one's sadhana becomes fruitful very fast. We all struggle for a lo=
ng time because something or the other is lacking. But it is better than no=
thing.
 
Do not worry about what is not in your hands and keep doing everyt=
hing that is in your hands.
 
Kaalidas was a totally ignorant person. Kaali=
 blessed him and he became the greatest scholar of his time in a split seco=
nd. If one can try to cultivate perfect surrender to a deity while one does=
 a sadhana, that is all one can do. When, why and how the blessings come is=
 beyond our grasp. But note one fundamental fact - no effort goes waste and=
 each action will result in a reaction sooner or later. So keep doing the b=
est you can in your spiritual sadhana.
 
Imagine that there is a hill that =
is steep on one side with a a comfortable slope on the other side. If one h=
as the right mountain climbing gear, one can climb on the steep side and re=
ach the top quickly. If one doesn't, one can still walk on the slope and ev=
entually get to the top. If your pronunciation, procedure etc are perfect, =
good for you. If not, don't be disheartened. Just keep walking on the slope=
 side.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

        Dear Ravi

        Beautiful mail. I saw the vedi=
o of Narasimhaji as well. One thing I realized that my pronounciations, unl=
ike the way Narasimhaji says swahaa etc etc, are horribly wrong. I just can=
t get the chanda and intonations correct. Its just a flat tone in my voice.=


        How wrong is wrong pronounciation? I am trying hard to change but=
 sad;y I guess I have no sense of rhythm or intonations etc at all.

          Namaste Nalini and Hari,
              =
    I agree with Hari. Starting off with Ganapathi Homam is definitely bett=
er. The procedure is short and it helps one practice the fire management, t=
he mantras, the swaras and the whole nine yards. Moreover, the Chandi Homam=
 Manual by itself is not self-sufficient. It relies on Ganapathi Homam manu=
al. So, you have to go back and forth between the 2 manuals to perform Chan=
di Homam which can be done but gets little bit tricky in the beginning. So,=
 get comfortable with the Ganapathi Homam procedure.
                  Afte=
r you feel comfortable with the Ganapathi Homam procedure, while continuing=
 to do Ganapathi Homam daily, you can actually do Chandi Homam occasionally=
 on certain days say weekends, or on Ashtami, Navami and Chaturdasi which a=
re especially auspicious for Chandipath/Chandi Homam. When doing Chandi Hom=
am, you can skip your Ganapathi Homam for that day. After doing this for fe=
w months or when you feel you are comfortable with the Chandi Homam, finall=
y settle down with it.
                  It's getting close to an year sinc=
e I did my first Chandi Homam and Narasimhaji was with me, guiding me with =
fire management and helping me with the copra pieces, correcting my pronunc=
iation and all. I used to do it over weekends, which for me was taking abou=
t 3- 3 1/2hrs initially, owing to my poor Telugu reading skills. Then, slow=
ly switched to daily after the whole process started taking about 2 hrs. Wh=
ile still, I am not perfect, I continue to practice. On this note, I am rem=
inded of Narayan.
                  The idea of writing a Maha Ganapathi Ho=
mam manual started off as Narayan asked Narasimha to help him out with the =
Homam Procedure. (Narayan's own inspiring message in this regard can be rea=
d at http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 727). After the=
 manual was prepared, Narasimhaji emailed the first copy to Narayan. Such w=
as Narayan's dedication that he started going through the manual over and o=
ver. A few days later I met Narayan and enquired about the Homam manual and=
 all. He very casually mentioned that he was doing the Homam mentally. I wa=
s dumbstruck. I said "What?". He said he would perform the whole procedure =
as mentioned in the document, IN MIND. Imagining taking the vow, imagining =
Agni pratishtapana, imagining invoking Ganesha, imagining offering ahutis, =
everything, start to finish in mind. I was really bowled over by his creati=
ve thinking. That is how Narayan practiced. Later, Narasimhaji gifted us Ho=
ma Kundam and we started our Homas. After few months passed by and I had to=
 go on couple of trips where I could not carry my Homa Kundam and all the s=
amagri. I implemented Narayan's idea and did my homam mentally for those fe=
w days. It then helped me avoid that feeling that I missed my homam. Though=
 this process is not a replacement for the Homam with all the physical mate=
rials, yet, it is a form of a prayer to God. Something is better than nothi=
ng.
                  Naliniji, She has already decided when you would star=
t the Homam, it's just that we have not been informed yet. 
               =
   I wish you all the very best.

          Best Regards
          Ravi

          Dear Nalini, namaste




       =
     ...thought I should probably start with Ganapati Homam and wondered if=
 I also start Chandi homam... 







          {Hari} I also had similar t=
houghts like you but I think that starting with Ganesha homam is better and=
 then one can 'graduate' to Chandi homam.


            Sadly, when I enqui=
red locally (New Zealand) at the Indian shops I could not find Homa Kundam.=
..






          {Hari} Why not try to purchase it from rediff.com? A sma=
ll copper homa kundam will cost around Rs 150 or so. Additionally you could=
 ask the priest at the local temples there...I am sure they will guide you.=
 


          After the first attempt to do Ganesha homam on 26 January, I =
did the homa again last Sunday and this time, it worked out fine.  


     =
     best regards
          Hari

          mind. I was really bowled over by his crea=
tive thinking. That is how 
          Narayan <SPAN style=3D"FONT-WEIGHT: b=
old">practiced</SPAN>. Later, 
          Narasimhaji gifted us Homa Kundam =
and we started our Homas. After few 
          months passed by and I had t=
o go on couple of trips where I could not 
          carry my Homa Kundam a=
nd all the samagri. I implemented Narayan's idea 
          and did my homa=
m mentally for those few days. It then helped me avoid 
          that feel=
ing that I missed my homam. Though this process is not a 
          replace=
ment for the Homam with all the physical materials, yet, it is 
          a=
 form of a prayer to God. Something is better than 
          nothing.<BR>&=

          has alre=
