Dear Narasimha,

Thanks to you and Ajit for the clarifications. I had sent an e-mail yesterday about a related topic yesterday but it has not been posted as yet, so I am resending it.

As I was watching the Shiva Abhishekam at the temple with milk, curd, ghee etc. an issue came up and I would appreciate your opinion/thoughts on it.

Use of dairy products (milk, curd, ghee) is extolled in our tradition and is encouraged as part of a saatwik lifestyle. However, in this Kali yuga, the reality is that the cows that provide these dairy products for our consumption and use in religious rituals, suffer terribly throughout their life and meet a painful end. This is specially true in large dairy operations in America but I suspect it would be true elsewhere too.

So, how do you reconcile the religious beliefs/doctrine and the reality of today's life, with respect to using diary products.

I am providing a link to a website that was sent to me by a friend. Note: The documentaries on the website, specially "Earthlings" are quite graphic and may not be for everyone but they do depict a reality that is going on these days.

warm regards,
Chandraprakash

Namaste,
 
As Ajit Krishnan has clarified correctly, Maha Shivaratri is to be observed on the night of March 5 (Wednesday - today) in the entire north America.
 
Some temples in USA are observing it on Thursday night, but there ARE some temples that are observing it correctly on Wednesday.
 
Happy Maha Shivaratri to all of you!
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

Chaturdashi starts around 3 pm EST on March 5 and ends on Thursday, March 6 around 2 pm EST. I assumed that you would fast and pray the night of March 5 but our temple priests insists that we need to celebrate it on the midnight of March 6, when, in fact, it will be amavasya during the entire night...
