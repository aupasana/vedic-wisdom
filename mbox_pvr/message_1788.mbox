Namaste,

As long as the seed of ego (sense of "I") has some rawness, it can give =
rise to the plant of self-absorption which can grow and become the tree of =
pride. Yes, pride can return in many forms. Ironically, as you said, one ca=
n be proud of one's apparent humility also, in which case that apparent hum=
ility is a facade.
 
Only when the seed of ego is sufficiently fried in the=
 heat of self-realization is the chance of it giving rise to the tree of pr=
ide ruled out completely.

The problem with intellect is not that it qu=
estions. The problem with it is that it has no answers to the highest quest=
ions.
 
Logical and analytical thinking is a function of pingala/surya nadi=
. Emotional and intuitive thinking and beliefs are a function of ida/chandr=
a nadi. Neither is sufficient to reveal the absolute. Various higher beings=
 exist within the sushumna nadi in the middle. The absorption in the absolu=
te is at the end of it.
 
I am not telling people to become stupid or throw=
 their intellect in ganges. I am only pointing out that regular intelligenc=
e is insufficient to realize the absolute.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

I disagree here. Intellect is disliked because it questions. And when the a=
nswers are not comfortable with our existing beliefs we find excuse to quit=
e our mind. There are many ways to find God. Intellect never hinders. The s=
ame way pride also has many disguise. One can be proud of humility or one's=
 devotion to god as well.

 Swami Vivekananda had one of the sharpest intellects in the world in the l=
