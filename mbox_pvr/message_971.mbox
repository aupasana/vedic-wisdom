Namaste,
 
Yes, god can come into an idol or into water in a pot or into th=
e fire in a homa kundam. You are asking god to accept aahutis in the form o=
f Agni.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

        Dear Si=
r,
        In your last mail regarding invoking you have said that we have =
to invoke deity in fire. A foolish question I am asking. How can we invite =
God in fire? If the meaning is that the deity himself is accepting Ahutis i=
n the form of Agni then it is convinced. God can come in any form so if he =
himself is Agni while Homam it is ok. Kindly clarify sir.

    Namaste,

          (1) When you invoke the presence of a deity like Ga=
nesha or Krishna or 
          Lakshmi or Durga or Vishnu or Shani or Shiva=
 in a fire, it is one thing. 
          When you invoke the presence of man=
es (departed souls) in a water pot, it is 
          a different thing. The=
 manes who are invoked in pitri tarpana have some 
          strong desires=
. Their ethereal bodies have more restrictions than deities. 
          To =
make it a bit easier for them to come and leave, standard rules involve 
  =
        some place restrictions.

          (2) I personally do it also for=
 the seven rishis of my gotra. You can add 
          the 1/3/7 rishis of y=
our gotra if you know them. There is no need to do more 
          times in=
 one sitting.

          (3) Yes, it is ok. Durva (sacred grass used for pu=
rification) can be reused. 
          Water can be thrown away at the base =
of a tree or a plant.

          (4) Only for pitri tarpana.

          (5)=
 Yes. If a deity has a desire, you are doing your part in fulfilling it. 
 =
         Every embodied being (embodied in gross and ethereal matter) has d=
esires and 
          stuck in maya to some extent or the other. You fulfil=
 your duty towards them 
          and repay your debt to them by offering =
tarpana to satisfy their desires.

          Best regards,
          Narasi=
