Dear Narayan,

Todala tantra also maps Vishnu's ten incarnations to Dasa maha vidyas. 
Krishna is associated with Kaali there too. However, Shiva teaches Parvati 
in Todala tantra that Maatangi is Rama. Can you give the full list of 
mapping as given in Munda maalaa tantra?

Best regards,
Narasimha
