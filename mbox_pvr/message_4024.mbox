Dear Girish,
 
All the best!
 
(1) The manuals I am looking at do have that mantras "poornamadah" and "poornaahutimuttamaam" and then navarna mantra with vaushat added.
 
(2) Tarpana to Ganapathi, either as a stand-alone procedure or as a part of homam, is popular. But tarpana is not popular in tradition with Chandi homam. I am not sure why. Tarpayaami literally means "I am satisfying". Perhaps it is useful to satify Ganapathi who is in charge of the material realm (Bhuloka or Moolaadhaara chakra). Chandi is the fierce primordial energy running the universe and can one really "satisfy" that energy? One can only surrender to that energy and flow with it..
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

As guided by you and Rajarshi I started reciting the Chandi Path every day (a few chapters at first, then end to end recently) and by the blessings of the mother I am now able to complete the entire recitation within 2 hours. I am planning to start doing Chandi Homam regularly(at least once a month) starting this Sunday, mother willing. I pray to the mother and Request your well wishes along with all the other Chandi sadhakas in this group to help me in successfully complete this great task.
