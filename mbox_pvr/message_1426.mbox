Dear Manish,

> What does self identification with a deity means?

Who are *you*? Are you really this body?

One normally identifies with a body, a name and a limited identity that goes 
with that body. This identification is very very strong.

You are actually Brahman, the all-pervading, all-knowing and all-being 
essence of the universe. The same essence manifests as various beings, 
including various deities and various people, including your own body. And 
*you* really are that essence and not the body. Still you identify only with 
the body.

It is possible to destroy this self identification with the body and 
identify with another object such as a deity. When you identify with a 
deity, your consciousness is in communion with that of the deity. Your will, 
thoughts and actions are those of the deity.

> When somebody says me to self identify with Shiva what exactly I have to 
> do ?

First I can tell you what exactly you have to avoid: Do NOT tell yourself 
that you will now identify with Shiva, because Shiva is great and you want 
to be great. In other words, this is not for ego satisfaction. In fact, 
until ego completely goes, it is not even possible.

Before you can self-identify with any deity, first your false 
self-identification with body has to cease. You should absolutely not think 
of your body as "I".

Your will, thoughts and actions should be those of Shiva.

Will Shiva think of a specific physical body as "I"? No. If a specific 
physical body has good or bad things happening to it, will Shiva feel 
pleasure or pain? No. If people are praising a specific person, will Shiva 
feel proud? No. If people are attacking and criticizing a specific person, 
will Shiva feel angry? No.

The first step is to overcome attachment to the body, name etc. Reach a 
state where you are not very sensitive to pleasure and pain to the body and 
praise and criticism of your thoughts and actions by other people. Reach a 
state where equanimity of mind can be maintained in all circumstances.

WHEN you reach that state, meditate with a mantra of Shiva while thinking of 
Shiva.

*        *        *

Ramakrishna Paramahamsa could self-identify with not only deities, but 
pretty much any object of the universe. Once he went into deep meditation 
while admiring the beauty of grass in the lawn with dew on it. As he was 
absorbed in deep meditation, a bird came and walked on the grass. His 
sishyas observed that some bruises appeared on his body suddenly then!

Best regards,
Narasimha
