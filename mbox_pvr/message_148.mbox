Namaste friends,
 
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa once said that even Vedas are co=
rrupted these days. It is the nature of Kali yuga to corrupt everything.
 
=
It is my feeling that many people, including highly learned Vedic scholars,=
 pronounce some sounds in Sanskrit mantras (including Veda mantras) incorre=
ctly.
 
Of course, pronunciation is not everything. Having devotion and the=
 spirit of surrender to god is even more important. However, pronunciation =
is a factor too. Especially, correct pronunciation is very important in Ved=
a mantras. Wrong pronunciation of a Veda mantra can stop one from the most =
complete experience of the mantra. In fact, we have a lot of people who can=
 memorize and repeat Veda mantras, but very few who can actually "experienc=
e" a mantra.
 
Over the next few months, I will write my views on correct p=
ronunciation and point out some common errors. If you do not think that cor=
rect pronunciation is important or if you disagree with my assessment of th=
e errors or if you do not want to change your pronunciation, please ignore =
my writings on this subject. On the other hand, if you are open to changing=
 your pronunciation, please give a consideration to my views and adopt my s=
uggestions if you find them appropriate.
 
*        *        *
 
Take the "=
t" sound at the end of the words like "prachodayaat", "ava purastaat", "sah=
asrapaat" etc. Most priests and scholars pronounce this sound incorrectly. =
They change "t" to something like "tu" or "ttu" or "ti" or "tti". There is =
a reason why this corruption came into practice, but it is a corruption nev=
ertheless.
 
In "prachodayaat", the sound "yaat" as one letter/syllable/aks=
hara. If you change it into "yaattu" or "yaatu" by adding a vowel sound at =
the end, it becomes two aksharas. This increases the number of aksharas, ch=
anges the chhandas and changes the meaning also. You may still experience s=
omething when meditating on the mantra, but you will never experience the m=
antra to the fullest with that pronunciation.
 
Akshara means "unperished".=
 Vowels (swaras) are the praana (life force) of an akshara. If you have jus=
t a consonant without a vowel after it, then it has no praana. It is kshara=
 and NOT an akshara. It perishes. For example, if you pronounce "t" as is (=
without adding any sounds to it), you cannot sustain the sound and the list=
ener cannot decipher what exactly you pronounced. It has no life force.
 
I=
n "prachodayaat", the whole sound "yaat" is one akshara. Because "t" has no=
 praana by itself, it simply joins to the akshara "yaa" (which has the vowe=
l "aa" as its praana) and becomes part of that akshara. In chhandas, "yaat"=
 is considered one letter (one guru). When you pronounce "yaat" correctly, =
it is difficult for the listener to know for sure whether you said "yaat" o=
r "yaak" or "yaan". It is possible if one listens carefully, but otherwise =
difficult. The "t" at the end is a very quick and abrupt transient sound wi=
thout praana. So it tough to hear clearly.
 
This makes people add some vow=
el to it (like "u" or "a" or "o" or "i" or some other vowel sound in betwee=
n them) so that the "t" sound gets a praana and becomes clearly audible. It=
 suddenly becomes an akshara and the chhandas changes.
 
Probably, some big=
 teacher started pronouncing "yaat" as "yaatu" so that "t" gets a praana of=
 itself and becomes very clear to hear, so that his students would not get =
confused when learning. Probably the students thought the mantra was "yaatu=
" (instead of "yaat") and got used to that mis-pronunciation. Probably, tha=
t became a standard practice after a couple of centuries.
 
If you pronounc=
e the English word "path", you do not change it to "paaththu". You say "th"=
 at the end of "path" as a consonant and leave it there. You don't force an=
 vowel sound to be added at the end. The same thing holds for "t" in "prach=
odayaat".
 
*        *        *
 
What I said about words ending in consona=
nts applies to all consonants and not just "t", though "t" is more commonly=
 encountered. There can be words that end in "n" or "k" etc also. There als=
o, people normally add an artificial vowel sound at the end and end up chan=
ging the chhandas and altering the flow of energy in the mantra. That is al=
so wrong.
 
*        *        *
 
One more common mistake is the sound "tha=
" (as in "kathaa" =3D story). Most south Indians pronounce this as "dha" (a=
s in "dhana" =3D money). In Telugu and Kannada scripts, the symbols of tha =
and dha looks very similar and just one dot in the middle is different. It =
is possible that some people started mispronouncing this sound because of t=
heir inability to see the dot and others started following. Now pronouncing=
 tha as dha became mainstream and one pronouncing correctly will be the odd=
 person out.
 
Sanskrit is not English. We never have two different symbols=
 for the same sound or two different sounds for the same symbol. The letter=
s "tha" and "dha" are different and their sounds are different too. Pronoun=
ce "t" (as in "tanu" =3D body or "taamra" =3D copper) with a stress/aspirat=
ion to get "th" (as in "kathaa" =3D story).
 
In the sankalpa before many p=
oojas, people say "dharmaartha kaama moksha chaturvidha purushaartha siddhy=
artham". This means "for attaining the purusharthas (purposes of human exis=
tence) - dharma (fulfilling duties), artha (work and money), kaama (fulfill=
ing desires) and moksha (developing detachment)". Most people end up pronou=
ncing "dharmaartha kaama moksha" as "dharmaardha kaama moksha". It means "h=
alf of dharma, kaama and moksha". Even "siddhardham" means "half attainment=
" and "purushaardha" means "half a human". Mis-pronunciation in this sankal=
pa is a bad mistake and I have seen it committed by many many trained pries=
ts!
 
When you read Vaidika/Taantrika/Pouranika mantras, pay attention to t=
he difference between "tha" and "dha" and learn to pronounce them different=
ly. When you see "tha" or "dha" in the mantra, pay extra attention to ensur=
e that you are not confusing tha for dha.
 
*        *        *
 
There are=
 several other mistakes (in my view) commonly made by most people in the pr=
onunciation of Sanskrit mantras. I will be pointing them out slowly in the =
next few months, whenever the Mother allows me to.
 
Please give me your co=
nsideration and take my input into consideration in altering your pronuncia=
tion (if you are open to that). If you don't find any sense in what I am sa=
ying or want to continue as taught by your gurus, I can understand that. I =
am not here to change everybody's pronunciation. But, because She inspired =
me to share my thoughts with the world, I am guessing that there are SOME w=
ho are destined to change their pronunciation based on my views. That is wh=
y I am writing these mails.
 
If you do not like this discussion, I am sorr=
y and just ignore this idiot!
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
