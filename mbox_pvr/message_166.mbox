Dear Ajit,

> (a) If we say that pronounciation of vedas is largely corrupted, does

I am not saying that it is largely corrupted. I am saying that even Vedic 
scholars mis-pronounce certain basic sounds of Sanskrit.

To simplify the problem, I think I should focus on the pronunciation of 
Pouraanika mantras and stay away from Vaidika mantras for now. I think I 
will do that.

Thanks for your important mail.

Best regards,
Narasimha
