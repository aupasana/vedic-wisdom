Respected Narasimhaji,

Namaskaaram !

I think,with my limited ability to i=
nterpret the jyotisha mahaavidyaa-you have revealed a major point by showin=
g Moon representing the pitris(our ancestors);does this imply that people w=
ho have Neecha(Vrischika) Moon or afflicted Moon must do the Pitri tarpana.=

We / I know of people who have such natal charts and suffer despite posses=
sing worldly qualifications....Your valued comments will surely help those =
who suffer.=A0 =A0 =A0 

Pranaamas,
amit

Namaste,
 
This dream presumably happened in Pisces lagna with =
lagna lord Jupiter in 12th and 9th lord Mars in 5th. There may be something=
 in this dream to aid your own spiritual progress. Except that, I do not th=
ink the dream means much literally.
 
*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *
 =

My take is that this dream is a message to you to start doing pitri tarpan=
a. Pitri tarpana (meaning: satisfying ancestral manes) is a procedure that =
can be finished in 5-10 min in its shortest form. In fact, a short pitri ta=
rpana used to be an integral part of daily religious sadhana every morning,=
 not so long ago.
 
*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *
 
One can download =
free Pitri tarpana manuals at
 
http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana
 
Th=
e manuals explain in detail three versions of the procedure - super-short (=
5-10 min), short (12-20 min) and regular (30-45 min). Manuals are available=
 with mantras=A0 given in various scripts (English, Sanskrit, Bengali, Guja=
rati, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Tamil and Telugu).
 
*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0=
 =A0 =A0 =A0 *
 
If a pitri or ancestral mane is stuck in pitri loka, it af=
fects one's mind. Suppose a lustful ancestor got stuck upon death in=A0 pit=
ri loka (i.e. the realm of consciousness where mind and its predispositions=
 dominate), instead of progressing to another realm of consciousness or bei=
ng reborn to fulfil remaining desires. Then minds of some descendants may b=
e genetically/kaarmically predisposed to lust. Same with other weaknesses.
=
 
Though one can look at a pitri as an external being,=A0 everything extern=
al maps internally. One's pitris are present within one as various tendenci=
es based on genetic and kaarmik predispositions. Freeing a pitri and granti=
ng him rebirth is essentially the same as freeing one's own mind from certa=
in genetic and kaarmik predispositions.
 
*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0=
 *
 
In astrology, horas in hora chart are ruled by Sun (fire) or Moon (wat=
er). Sun's horas are controlled by devas (gods) and Moon's horas are contro=
lled by pitris (ancestral manes).
 
We all have a physical body (lagna), a =
mind (Moon) and a soul (Sun). Pitris are beings that self-identify more str=
ongly with the mind (Moon) and they are best propitiated using the medium o=
f water (tarpana). Devas are beings that self-identify more strongly with t=
he soul (Sun) and they are best propitiated using the medium of fire (homam=
).
 
If one does a 30-minute homam to any deity (e.g. Ganapathi) and a 10-m=
inute pitri tarpana everyday (or every weekend), it can accelerate one's sp=
iritual progress and make everything else one does more effective. In fact,=
 a fire ritual and a tarpana were part of the daily routine of learned Hind=
us not long ago.
 
*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *
 
Modern world looks=
 down upon rituals, but rituals are externalized actions that are carefully=
 designed and that eventually bring internal transformation on repetition.
=
 
Every action and every thought of ours has an impact and leaves an imprin=
t on our consciousness. If we want to shape our consciousness in a particul=
ar useful way, some repeated actions coupled with some thoughts can be used=
.
 
Thinking of stuck ancestors and praying for their freedom, while water =
flows over some important energy centers in the palm, is certainly a useful=
 exercise. Contemplating=A0 a deity while imagining him/her in fire is cert=
ainly a useful exercise.
 
*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *
 
The decrea=
se of dharma and increase of adharma in the world places our earth in a pre=
carious position. Though very patient, Mother Earth cannot let her children=
 destroy themselves with their careless actions that ruin earth and irrespo=
nsible inaction in important matters. If Mother Earth takes corrective acti=
on to change the course, it will be painful for many people. For changes to=
 occur smoothly and relatively painlessly, we need to maintain a certain le=
vel of dharma in the world.
 
If a few thousands of people are doing homam =
to various deities on a regular basis, without any selfish material motivat=
ions but to just increase dharma in the world and to progress spiritually i=
n the process, it will make a big difference to the world.
 
In fact, the d=
ivine Mother appeared and asked my guru in March 2006 to teach simple homam=
 procedures to anybody who is interested in spiritual progress and help inc=
rease dharma in the world. I see that some people who never even lit a lamp=
 in their lives are doing a daily homam today and I am convinced that the M=
other's will will be fulfilled in time.
 
Detailed manuals of a short homam=
 ritual to various deities are available at:
 
http://www.VedicAstrologer.o=
rg/homam
 
*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *
 
Interestingly, I was think=
ing a few days back to write a few lines about the importance of pitri tarp=
ana and homam on yahoogroups. Your mail gives me the opportunity..
