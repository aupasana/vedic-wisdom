Namaste Narasimha,
=C2=A0
I disgree with two points you mentioned. Let me c=
larify. (I am only dealing with 
the science part of these discussions, as =
I had already maintained right at the 
beginning).
=C2=A0
(3) I heard an in=
terview with a scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) several 
months bac=
k. They conducted an experiment on gorillas. One set of gorillas was 
fed w=
ith meat. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After several 
month=
s, researchers found a gap in the intelligence of the two sets. The ones 
f=
ed with meat were duller.

If=C2=A0you have any references for this, in ter=
ms of whether they published any 
paper on the same, I am interested to kno=
w and analyse that in details. I am 
open to learning and reviewing my posi=
tion, provided there is genuine evidence.
=C2=A0
Their theory was that dige=
stion of meat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed with 
nuts and fruits may =
have diverted more energy towards the development of brain. 
Though they we=
re not sure if the same thing applies to human beings or not,=C2=A0=C2=A0a =

balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maximize one's intellectual developme=
nt.
=C2=A0
This is a wrong theory as far as human nutrition=C2=A0is concern=
ed, because human 
stomach structure (gut morphology) is such that it finds=
 certain animal products 
far easier to digest than most planet based produ=
cts. In my other mail, I have 
qoted from a couple of research papers and b=
ooks on clinical nutrition and 
dietetics, and if you ask, I can provide mo=
re; which may=C2=A0take a few days since I 
have to get them from people wh=
o deal with these topics professionally, but time 
is not a problem.=C2=A0A=
ll the papers are=C2=A0from the most accepted and reputed 
scientific=C2=A0=
journals. There is no confusion. Which is why I said, it is myth 
that=C2=
=A0vegeterian=C2=A0foods are=C2=A0easier to digest, if digestibility is the=
 criteria. 

=C2=A0
Further, in my experience, I never found traditional ve=
geterians to be any more 
dull or smarter than traditional omnivores. 

=C2=
=A0
(7) Regarding Priya's question: Animals have their own vaasanas and the=
ir needs. 
If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, fe=
ed the poor 
fellow whatever he/she needs.
=C2=A0
An animal has a specific =
physical=C2=A0structure and needs to maintain the same. But 
if trained the=
y can 'adjust' to any kind of meals. I have seen people feeding 
vegeterian=
 diets to dogs. Statistically speaking, an animal whose whole body 
structu=
re is designed to be a carnivore, may adjust to any food for the sake of 
s=
urvival, but will become internally weak and susceptable to disease and 
we=
aknesses. Who takes the karma for the disease and weakness that may result =

from an unnatural diet to an animal? 

=C2=A0
Not that all dogs who are fe=
ed a veg diet end up being diseased, but the chances 
increase a lot. It is=
 like not all smokers die of cancer, but smoking makes one 
susceptible to =
cancer. It increases the probability. Therefore my personal 
opinion is tha=
t an animal if kept at home, it should taken care of in the best 
way possi=
ble, providing it with whatever maybe needed, including the right diet.
=C2=
=A0
=C2=A0
_______________
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
A question for you.
=C2=A0
Scienti=
sts studying evolution and human body structures have concluded that meat 
=
eating along with cropping and fruits has been prevelant since at least 4 
=
million years. That, without a diet which was omnivorous, the structure of =
the 
human stomach (lack of a developed=C2=A0caecum),=C2=A0and the threefol=
d increase in=C2=A0brain 
size (from archeological evidences)=C2=A0could ne=
ver have been what it is today. 
Which means, an omnivorous diet has been a=
=C2=A0natural process, so ingrained that it 
has changed the very structure=
 of the human body. This cannot be done 
consciously, but only by the work =
of natural forces. (Again, if you want, I will 
provide relevent research=
=C2=A0papers to prove my claim).
=C2=A0
What is your take on this?

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Food w=
e eat

=C2=A0 
Namaste friends,

There has been a lot of discussion on food=
. A few quick comments.

(1) We are we we eat. Production of various chemic=
als in our body and their 
interactions, are controlled by what we eat. Thu=
s, what we eat has a profound 
impact on us.

(2) Much has been written on =
the material benefits from vegetarianism. But that 
is not all. There are s=
piritual and subtle reasons as well.

Eating the flesh or body parts of an =
animal that strongly identifies with the 
physical body entails a karma. Se=
lf-identification of plants with their physical 
body is much subtler and t=
he karma entailed in eating plant-based foods is much 
smaller.

Especially=
 these days, very cruel methods are used for meat production by 
corporatio=
ns and animals are treated very cruelly. Part of the karma for their 
suffe=
ring goes to the ones benefiting from their meat.

(3) I heard an interview=
 with a scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) several 
months back. They=
 conducted an experiment on gorillas. One set of gorillas was 
fed with mea=
t. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After several 
months, rese=
archers found a gap in the intelligence of the two sets. The ones 
fed with=
 meat were duller.

Their theory was that digestion of meat takes up more e=
nergy. Gorillas fed with 
nuts and fruits may have diverted more energy tow=
ards the development of brain. 
Though they were not sure if the same thing=
 applies to human beings or not, a 
balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can ma=
ximize one's intellectual development.

(4) After we eat a heavy meal, we m=
ay feel dull or sleepy and cannot focus well 
on work that requires alertne=
ss and skill. That is because the digestive process 
is using up a lot of e=
nergy (also known as agni or fire) and there isn't much 
agni available for=
 other activities such as digestion of intellectual ideas that 
happens in =
the mind. Similarly, digestion of spiritual ideas/experiences also 
require=
s agni and that cannot happen well. That is why meditation or homam after 
=
a heavy meal are fruitless and we are normally advised to do sadhana before=
 
eating.

(5) If foods that light up a higher digestive agni (e.g. meats, =
deep fried food 
with more oil, spicy foods that stimulate digestive agni e=
tc) are consumed more 
frequently, agni is diverted towards digestion more =
often and there is less agni 
available for assimilaring intellectual and s=
piritual ideas and experiences. If 
one eats saattwik food that is very eas=
y to digest (simple grains, simple 
lentils and simple vegetables, all soft=
ly cooked with mild spices, and fruits), 
less agni is diverted towards dig=
estion and more agni is available for 
assimilaring intellectual and spirit=
ual ideas and experiences.

(6) Even a big fire cannot burn wet grass well.=
 But huge stacks of dry grass may 
be burnt by just one spark! Similarly, l=
ittle bit of internal fire may be enough 
to assimilate spiritual ideas and=
 experiences in a person with excellent 
vaasanas and few obstructions (dry=
 grass). A lot of internal fire may be needed 
in a person with poor vaasan=
as and many obstructions (wet grass). Thus, it all 
depends on vaasanas and=
 impurities in nadis and chakras.

One person may eat meat and deep fried f=
oods, spend a lot of agni on digesting 
them and yet make excellent spiritu=
al progress. Another person may eat saattwik 
food, maximize the agni avail=
able for spiritual transformation and yet struggle 
to progress spiritually=
. However, the best course of action for one is to ignore 
counter-examples=
 and be a vegetarian. All other things being equal, that 
maximizes the agn=
i available for spiritual progress.

(7) Regarding Priya's question: Animal=
s have their own vaasanas and their needs. 
If an animal can survive on veg=
etarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor 
fellow whatever he/she needs.=


(8) One should eat to live and not live to eat. A yogi should consume eno=
ugh 
food to sustain oneself so that one can fulfil one's dharma in the mat=
erial 
world using physical body and make spiritual progress. Eating too mu=
ch food is 
not good for spiritual sadhana.

Instead of overeating most of =
the time and fasting on specific days, it is 
better to eat limited amount =
always. Regular practices are more important for 
transformation and succes=
s, than occasional practices.

(9) By merely thinking that god is the doer =
of all actions or considering food 
to be god's prasad, one cannot escape t=
he karma involved. It depends on how 
deeply ingrained that thought is and =
how deeply one feels so. If one internally 
feels 100% that god is acting t=
hrough one and whatever one is doing (e.g. 
eating) is just god's prasad to=
 one, then one is free.

Best regards,
Narasimha
