I am a beggar like others. But I try to help other beggars by showing the 
houses where they can try their luck by begging.

Normally, one beggar may view another beggar as a competitor and not like 
too many people to beg in the same area. However, this begging is different 
and there is no competition between different beggars. The owner of the 
house has enough to give to every beggar and does not mind giving to many 
beggars at the same time if they are worthy.

Actually, if one beggar gets something, it will be so much that he/she can 
share some of it with all around him/her. If you go with 100 other beggars 
and beg, you are better off. If any one of them is able to melt the heart of 
the owner of the house, all the hundred will benefit from it to varying 
degrees!

When I tell people about external practices such as homam and internal 
practices such as surrender and detachment in actions, all I am really doing 
is to take fellow beggars in front of a house where a rich person lives. If 
they are able to melt the heart of the owner of the house, their begging 
will be fruitful. That is completely in *their* hands.

I am only a beggar who can show a place where other beggars can beg and I am 
not really "capable" of anything more. Please do not treat me in any other 
way.

When Swami Brahmananda, the spiritual son of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, and 
Thakur himself saw themselves as beggars in front of the Mother, mama kim 
kathaa (what is my story).

*        *        *

In general, to those who are struggling with internal conflicts related to 
spiritual progress and getting frustrated, I have a few words. Rome is not 
built in a day. Forget Rome, even a small protocol of Rome is not built in a 
day! Be patient.

I have seen people change from inside out in a short span of time. There is 
no need to panic or give up hope.

*        *        *

Be patient. Read scriptures. Read the words of saints and yogis such as 
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Ramana Maharshi, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, 
Sankaracharya, Ramanujacharya, Madhvacharya, Sai Baba, Kabir, Jesus Christ, 
Buddha, Mahavira, Jnaneshwar etc. Try to understand what they are saying. 
Try to integrate some of it into your common sense, your way of thinking and 
your life style. Realize that the goal of spiritual practices is inner 
transformation. The archives of this yahoogroup also have some inspired 
writings.

Nobody can change you. You yourself can do it. You CAN do it, if you really 
want to. Introspect and go to the root of your problems. If you introspect 
and analyze each big problem, you will realize that ego is the root of it 
all. Whenever something in life seems fundamentally important, question why. 
I am not saying to leave it. Do what you normally do. But, atleast analyze 
why it is important and try to understand your inner motives. Scuh 
introspection will eventually lighten the clouds of fear, expectation, 
attachment and pride that often color one's attitude.

Introspect on your attitude and motives and contemplate on the nature of 
god. Meditate.

In this age, there is nothing like a total surrender to the Lord. Of course, 
saying "I surrender to you. So give me x or y" is NOT total surrender. Total 
surrender means you take whatever the Lord gives without questions and 
expectations. If you can manage it, you are all set!

*        *        *

Homam or worship of deities in fire is a powerful practice taught by rishis. 
I know from experience that it burns blocking karmas and enables the inner 
transformation. It is a very useful spiritual practice. I know people who 
made (and are making) considerable spiritual progress through regular 
practice of homam. It is the most powerful method I know of and teaching it 
is one of my tasks for this life.

Dear Rajesh, try to make some time in your daily schedule and start doing 
Mahaganapathi homam everyday. After a few months, you should switch to 
Vishnu sahasra naama homam (I will put it up on my website by then). THAT 
should help you find your way in your spiritual life and strike the right 
balance between spiritual life and material life.

The purpose of material life on this earth is to perform actions to pay back 
debts without incurring new debts, so that spiritual progress becomes 
smoother. Without paying certain debts, spiritual life cannot become smooth. 
However, without some spiritual progress, actions in material life create 
new debts. In the beginning, one needs to create a synergy between the two 
and use the actions in material life to promote spiritual life. For true 
spiritual progress, most people cannot and should not run away from material 
life.

Vasishtha said in the very beginning of Yoga Vaasishtham that action and 
knowledge are two wings with which the bird of manifested Self flies and 
becomes liberated. Action without correct knowledge creates pride, promote 
ego and binds one further instead of liberating. Knowledge without action 
does not become complete because of the remaining debts and one is stuck. 
One needs to have true knowledge and perform actions, to become free.

Best regards,
Narasimha
