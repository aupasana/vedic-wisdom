Namaste,

Your friend is essentially correct - body has no use or meaning after death. 
However, your friend is not entirely correct. If one has a deep attachment 
to the body, mind may be attached to the body even after death, even after 
the connection of the karmendriyas and jnanendriyas of the mind to the 
physical body is cut off. Then what happens to the body does affect the mind 
and its further progress.

*        *        *

When one takes sannyasa, i.e renounces material world, the last rites are to 
be done symbolically. After that, one is dead symbolically. However, if one 
does not have true renunciation and detachment from body, relatives and 
other material objects, there is no point in taking sannyasa or doing 
symbolic last rites. Even if one does it, mind may still be attached to the 
body. If last rites are not done after death, even a sannyasi's mind may 
have problems. On the other hand, a true sannyasi who is absolutely detached 
from the body even when alive will fly high when mind is finally freed from 
the body at death.

*        *        *

One cannot control what others do with one's body after one leaves it. So 
the wisest course of action would be to develop detachment even when alive. 
Divert the concern for the well-being of the body towards other people. Do 
bare minimum to keep the body alive and not be overly concerned about it. 
When you meditate, think only of god and try to forget that there is a body 
that you occupy. Even if leg hurts or neck itches, try to forget about it. 
If you ignore body for a while, it will cry out for attention, like an 
immature child who needs attention. If you give it attention, you cannot 
experience god. But, as you ignore body more, body will try more to get your 
attention (like an immature child who needs attention)! However, if you 
persist, body will have to eventually give up! THAT is when one can absorb 
the mind fully in god.

If one experiences that often while alive, that experience helps immensely 
at death. When the mind leaves the body for the last time, one can focus 
mind on god and ignore the attention grabbing cries for help from the body. 
One who successfully focuses mind on god when the last moment comes is 
liberated and gets saayujya or moksha. On the other hand, one who wavers 
from the focus on god and lets mind turn towards the plight of the dying 
body gets stuck.

To a yogi, each session of deep meditation is like a dress rehearsal of the 
last moment! Death is not to be feared. If faced correctly, it is the moment 
of final liberation. Life is meant to be a practice for it!

Instead of worrying about body and its last rites, let every ritual be a 
last rite! I suggest that one should practice detachment and develop the 
ability to absolutely ignore the pitiful cries of the body for attention as 
one tries to focus the mind on god and succeed in absorbing the mind in god 
when meditating. If one practices that, the issue of who does last rites and 
what rites becomes irrelevant.

*        *        *

Of course, one who performs brilliantly in dress rehearsals may still forget 
one's lines or put a wrong expression when playing the drama finally on the 
big stage. Similarly, a yogi who has overcome the attachment to body and 
absorbed the mind perfectly in god many times may still waver at the last 
moment and think of body or something else that is impermenant and be 
reborn.

However, all that is in our control is to practice and prepare for the last 
moment.

*        *        *

You are lucky. There are many Hindus who do not experience anything like 
what you described. Keep doing sadhana and overcome the little rawness that 
may still be left in the consciousness.

Best regards,
Narasimha
