Namaste,

I am a full-time engineer. I am working as a software manager at a 
semi-conductor company making SoC (System-on-Chip) solutions for the 
blu-ray/DVD market. Several blu-ray/DVD players containing software written 
by me and my group are being sold at "Best Buy" now. We sometimes work 12-15 
hours a day and weekends too. For example, I was at work this Sunday.

However, it is difficult to compare one's life with another's, as each has 
different circumstances. For example, I have a wife who shares my interests 
and co-operates. I have people around me who carry some positive spiritual 
vibrations. Someone else may have different situation.

What I say is this: Do the best you can, based on your constraints, 
circumstances and life goals.

However, I see that most people DO have some time but tend to spend it on 
not so useful activities. They spend time surfing internet, they spend time 
playing internet games, they spend time on a lot of emails, they spend time 
on TV, they spend time on activities like playing cards etc etc. If one 
really looks, one can always find some time.

One person I know, another software engineer, was doing a Mahaganapathi 
homam everyday. Then he switched to Chandi homam everyday. This made his 
lifestyle tight. Now he is doing one Chandi homam in the morning and another 
Chandi homam in the evening, everyday. It is just a matter of prioritizing 
spiritual sadhana appropriately so that there is time for it. We can do 
thousands of things, but have time to do only a few things. We choose the 
few things we do based on our sense of priority. Until spiritual sadhana 
becomes a priority for you, not much can be done about it..

The thing with homam is that it is the most efficient method for those with 
limited time. Even an half hour homam done everyday will make a lot of 
difference over the long run.

If one has absolutely no time for homam, japam etc, one can atleast do 
internal sadhana, i.e. redirect the thinking and attitude in various 
activities done throughout the day.

Especially in big cities around the world where people are always running 
and filled with too much rajas and tamas do some serious sadhakas need to 
come up and do serious sadhana like daily homam.

We waste a lot of emotional and intellectual energy dwelling on irrelevant 
things. We bask "He likes me..he praised me so much". We sulk "he was unfair 
in criticizing me". And so on. Lingering emotions in our interactions with 
others take up a lot of emotional and intellectual energy and we are left 
with no energy for doing important things. Try to free your mind from 
lingering emotions, conserve the emotional energy and see if it makes a 
difference.

Best regards,
Narasimha
