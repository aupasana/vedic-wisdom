Namaste,

As Narayan says, A and B are inefficient and C is the best. I can actually 
suggest D - pick any one deity (e.g. Rama, Krishna, Shiva, Ganapathi etc) 
and do homam to that deity everyday (or every week).

If one wants water, one should dig in one place as deep as one can. Instead 
of digging two feet in 10 places, it is better to dig 20 feet in one place. 
The chance of finding water is higher then.

Best regards,
Narasimha
