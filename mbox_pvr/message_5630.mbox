Namaste Prakash ji,
 
> My only point is that even during the times of Maharishi

Being a rishi is different from getting moksha. Let me elaborate using the same metaphor of acting in a drama.
 
A lot of actors (people) in a drama (samsara, i.e. world) take the drama too seriously, do not like what happens in the scene they act and try to change the script to enhance their role or make it look better. They do not realize that the director (supreme power running the universe) picked characters and scenes based on how one acted before (previous lives) and what suits one. They complain endlessly, not realizing the futility.
 
When people's scenes end, they are sent out of the drama room (death). Being used to the drama so much, they want to come back and the director finds another role for them (rebirth).
 
When their scenes end, some people realize that it is just a drama and not real. They leave without any regret or a desire to come back. They do not act again (no rebirth) and they are free from the drama (moksha).
 
Some people realize while acting in their scene (when still alive) that it is just a drama and not real (jeevanmukti, liberation while alive). They go through the motions, finish their scene and leave the drama (leave body). They do not act after that (no rebirth) and they are free from the drama.
 
Now, there are some special people (rishis) who realize that the drama is not real and stop taking it seriously and yet are at the disposal of director *forever*. They never leave the drama and do whatever director wants them to do, without complaining and without any attitude. It is also because they understand the director fully and are in sync with the director.
 
They are free in the sense that they are not taking the drama seriously like other actors (unliberated people) and yet they have not left the drama (like liberated people)!
 
For them, there is no difference between Shiva (or Purusha) and Shakti (or Prakriti), i.e. non-dual Self and the field of duality are one and the same for them. They can act in the field of duality using an individualized consciousness and yet not trapped because they are in oneness with the non-dual Self at the same time. Rishis have perfect control over the field of duality, but the word "control" is not in an egoistic sense here. They have no ego. In terms of the metaphor, they are the trusted assistants of the director who are in perfect sync with the director and are fully empowered to do anything they want to do with the drama.
 
Thus, being a rishi is different from moksha.

Namaste Koperumcholan ji,
 
> As far as I could see with my little basic knowledge of Spiritual
> Astrology, you yourself are a Rishi, as your Lagna ...
 
I appreciate your kindness, but I know who I am. In any case, it is equally irrelevant and useless to praise and attack individuals on public forums.
 
The things you refer to ("executing sacred Dharma/Karma", "blessed person", "love of Humanity", "selfeless service", "Kundalini awakening", "Mantra Siddhi", "Divine Grace" etc) are all good things, but they are not enough to make one a rishi, i.e. one who swiftly flows with divine will with zero resistance.

Being a rishi is indeed an epic phenomenon. Unless one has an experience, one will perhaps be unable to appreciate the possibility of such a phenomenon and understand the word rishi in a lesser light.
 
Amshas of rishis appear in modern times with elevated concentrations of purified consciousness and they may do great deeds or influence many people positively.
 
*        *        *
 
Sometimes a great person comes, does great deeds and leaves. His sishyas, partly out of their respect for guru and partly out of their own ego (isn't it great to be sishya of a "rishi"?!), start calling him a rishi.
 
The word rishi should not be a spiritual status symbol. Not being rishi is not an insult. One can be a really great person and yet not be a rishi. The word has been cheapened by people.
 
*        *        *
 
Namaste Sri Wandahl,
 
> Well spoken! Thank you for this excellent message on rishies!
 
Thank you for your response. A yogi I respect highly told me that you are one of the few genuine yogis left in Jyotish today. Thus, despite any disagreements related to Jyotish knowledge, I have great respect for you.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

People think rishi just means a brilliant person or a nice person or a spiritual person. To be a rishi requires much much much more.

Just as a very light leaf flows in air more freely while a heavier rock falls due to its gravity, similarly one with lighter conditioning flows more freely with divine will, while one with denser conditioning is pulled by the gravity of that conditioning and cannot flow freely with the divine will.

Similarly, the Supreme Power that runs this universe gives important roles to beings who overcame individual egosense, have no individual agendas and conditioning, completely in sync with the Supreme Power and flow with divine will.
> >

One with *extremely light* conditioning is almost free and can get *really huge* things done in this universe. One with *zero* (or almost zero) conditioning can get *anything* (or almost anything) done in this universe.
> >  
> > Various categories of rishis are in that last zone of zero or near-zero conditioning! They have overcome their conditioning completely and have no desires, no agendas, no likes and no dislikes. They may behave like they have desires, agendas, dislikes, anger etc, but that is just like a drama actor reading out the lines as asked by the director. As one's conditioning drops off, individual I-ness and individual will wither away and one is in communion with the divine always. One has no will and no desires and one flows with the divine and can do ANY action willed by the divine. One becomes an instrument to implement divine will in the world. Such a being is infinitely powerful and can really do anything. Nature uses such beings for very very important work. Rishi means such a free-flowing and non-resistant entity.

As long as one remains in an individual body (physical or ethereal), *some* conditioning will normally remain. Removing the conditioning completely and being in oneness with the Supreme at all times, is a herculean task and perhaps not possible in today's times. Just as only one who has climbed the first 7,000 miles of a mountain knows how difficult it is to climb the next 100 miles, similarly a sadhaka who overcame a lot of one's conditioning alone will know how difficult it is to overcome the last bit of conditioning.

Even those saints in the last century or two whom their followers called rishis are most probably not rishis. Even if amsha of a rishi comes down to earth in these times, such an amsha may do some great deeds without reaching the level of a rishi again and then merge back (like a thread spawned from a main process in a computer program).
