Namaste,

> Repeat 200 malas of Japa daily.

If one is able to spend 4-5 hours everyday in chanting a mantra or any name 
of god, one will surely start to make brisk progress spiritually.

If one is unable to formally do japa with a maalaa for hours, I suggest 
mentally repeating a mantra whenever one is free. For example, one may be on 
a bus or a train traveling to work or sitting in a conference room waiting 
for a conference to walking from one place to another or standing in front 
of the stove cooking food or eating some food or whatever. If one's *mind* 
has a little *free time*, irrespective what the body is doing, one can chant 
one's mantra (whichever it is).

Sitting in one place and doing japa with some rules is definitely better, 
but, one can *supplement* such sadhana with chanting the mantra while 
walking or sitting in a train etc, which is also good. It is better than 
mind wandering here and there and gossipping about this and that. Use the 
mantra as a tool to stop the mind from wandering and to focus it on god.

Best regards,
Narasimha

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Swami Sivananda Maharaj on Japa Yoga


In this Kali Yuga (iron age) Japa alone is the easy way to the realisation 
of God. The famous author of a commentary on the Gita and of the 
Advaita-Siddhi, Swami Madhusudana Saraswati, had direct Darsan of Lord 
Krishna through Japa of the Mantra of Lord Krishna. The reputed Swami 
Vidyaranya, the author of the Panchadasi had direct Darsan of Mother Gayatri 
through Japa of Gayatri Mantra.

At the present moment many educated persons and college-students have lost 
faith in the power of Mantra, owing to the morbid influence of the study of 
science. They have entirely given up Japa. It is highly deplorable indeed. 
When the blood is warm they become hot-headed, proud and atheistic. Their 
brains and minds need a thorough overhauling and drastic flushing.

Life is short. Time is fleeting. The world is full of miseries. Cut the knot 
of Avidya, and drink the Nirvanic Bliss. That day on which you do not 
perform any Japa is simply wasted. Those who simply eat, drink and sleep and 
do not practise any Japa are horizontal beings only.

A Mantra, in the Hindu religion, has a Rishi who gave it to the world; a 
metre which governs the inflection of the voice; and a Devata or a 
supernatural being, higher or lower, as its informing power. The Bija, seed, 
is a significant word, or series of words, which gives it a special power. 
Sometimes this word is a sound which harmonises with the key-note of the 
individual using it and varies it with individuals; sometimes this word 
expresses the essence of the Mantra, and the result of the Mantra is the 
flower springing from this seed. The Sakti is the energy of the form of the 
Mantra, i.e., the vibration-forms set up by its sounds. These carry the man 
to the Devata that is worshipped. The Kilaka, the pillar, is that which 
supports and makes strong the Mantra, or the pin which fastens the Mantra 
together; this is the ceasing of sorrow, by the freeing of oneself from 
imperfections.

Do not bother yourself about Mantra, Para and Pasyanti, etc. Do Japa of your 
Ishta Mantra mentally with its meaning and right Bhava. You will realise the 
spiritual benefits. Why do you waste your time in counting the pebbles on 
the bank? Take a dip immediately in the Ganges and enjoy the bath. Become 
wise.

All Mantras have equal potency or power. It is incorrect to say that Om Namo 
Narayanaya is superior to Om Namah Sivaya or Radhesyam or Sri Ram, and so 
on. You can attain God-realisation by doing Japa of any Mantra. Valmiki 
attained God-consciousness by repealing even Mara-Mara. Some people think 
that Om or Soham is superior to Om Namo Narayanaya, or vice versa. This also 
is wrong. The state gained by doing Japa of Om or Soham can be attained by 
doing Japa of Sri Ram or Radhesyam also.

You should not doubt the teachings of the scriptures. Flickering faith will 
lead to downfall. A man of weak will, who has no faith in Japa, cannot 
expect to have progress in the spiritual path. If he says, "I am practicing 
`who am I' enquiry"-this is all wild imagination. Few are fit for "who am I" 
enquiry.

You must have the Bhava that Atman, Isvara, Devata, Mantra are one. With 
this Bhava you will have to repeat your Guru Mantra or Ishta Mantra. Then 
alone you will have Mantra Siddhi or God-realisation quickly.

The Japa of a Mantra can bring to the practitioner realisation of his 
highest goal though he may not possess knowledge of the meaning of the 
Mantra. Such a mechanical Japa may take a little more time in realisation 
than when it is practiced with a knowledge of the meaning. There is an 
indescribable power or Achintya Sakti in the Mantras. If you repeat the 
Mantra with concentration on its meaning, you will attain God-consciousness 
quickly.

Form a strong habit of repeating the Name of the Lord. Then only it will be 
easy for you to remember Him at the time of death.

To define God is to deny God. You can give the definition of a finite 
object. How can you define limitless or the Infinite Being who is the source 
and ultimate cause for everything? If you define God you are limiting the 
limitless one, you are confining Him with concepts of mind. God is beyond 
the reach of the gross mind, but He can be realised through Japa and 
meditation with a pure, subtle and one-pointed mind.


Japa is the repetition of any mantra or name of the Lord.In this iron age 
Japa is the easiest and surest way for God-realisation.

Repeat 200 malas of Japa daily. Mala or rosary is a whip to goad the mind 
towards God. Wear a mala on your neck. It is the most precious jewel or 
ornament as it reminds you of God.

Practice of Japa removes the impurities of the mind, destroys sins and 
brings the devotee face to face with God. Japa must become habitual. Be 
regular in your Japa.
