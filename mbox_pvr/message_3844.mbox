Namaskarams Narasimhaji, Manishji=C2=A0and Others,
I have been reading the =
mail exchanges on Aghora and Bramacharya with avid interest and here are a =
few cents of thoughts and also a request for correcting my line of thinking=
 in case I am going down the wrong path. I have been doing the Ganapathi Ho=
mam for the past half a year or so and I should say that I am not maintaini=
ng the Brahmacharya as "defined" in the mail exchanges and some books. I fe=
el that the problem with Sex with most of us is that we tend to identify it=
 with something wrong or something which is "impure" and hence forbidden. I=
 have been performing some experiments in my daily life and I have found th=
at it is defintitely possible to avoid the feelings of Lust, Greed and othe=
r feelings even while having sex. Although I am not perfect in this but I f=
eel with lot of practice it should=C2=A0be possible to achieve a state of m=
ind even during sex where you are focussed on=C2=A0God and not wavered by t=
he feelings that accompanies mundane sex. In this
 case even something as m=
aterialistic as Sex will be transformed into a=C2=A0intense spiritual sadha=
na.=C2=A0If you start thinking of Sex not as sometihng Impure and start doi=
ng it as Karma itself with out any other accompanying thoughts and do the "=
Act" itself as an offering to God then I feel that Brahmacharya as defined =
conventionally is not needed. I would say that we are very much observing B=
rahmacharya. Now coming to Ojas I doubt that Ojas can be so physical as Sem=
en. If the act of Sex is itself perfomed as an offering to God and without =
any thoughts other than that of God then where is the question of loosing a=
ny spiritual energy . In fact you are adding to your spiritual growth. 
I h=
ave observed a change in myself after doing this practically over the past =
couple of months. I have found that gradually over a period of time even th=
ough its possible to completely abstain from physical sex, it is also possi=
ble to avoid getting swayed by it and also not crave for it.
=C2=A0
Continu=
ing further=C2=A0, how would one justify "Nightfalls" which is a natural ph=
enomenon wherein the body automatically purges excess semen collected over =
a period of time when one is asleep without the persons control.In other wo=
rds it is an involuntary=C2=A0action just like breathing.

Can this also be=
=C2=A0intrepreted as break in Brahmacharya? I would be keen to know the exp=
eriences of those persons who have abstained from physical sex for an exten=
ded period of time and=C2=A0what they think=C2=A0of=C2=A0"Nightfalls".

***=
***************************************************************************=
**************************************************

I think that every acti=
on that we do should be done with the thought of an offering to god. For ex=
ample even while having food , we can think each bite as an offering to Gan=
apathi in fire (actually there is a fire in our stomach which burns the foo=
d) , Our entire body can be visuilased like a living moving Homa kundam whe=
re we continuously offer ahuti of differnet materials. If we conciously mak=
e this effort over a period of time we would think less about the process o=
f eating=C2=A0food itself , the accompanying pleasure of taste etc and conc=
entrate more on mental homam which we are performing. Every thought process=
 can be considered as an ahuti inside the mental fire in our soul.Like this=
 every action that we do in our daily life can be thought as a homam itself=
 and thereby achieve the state of mind where there is no distinction betwee=
n the so called "Pure" and "Impure" , "Good" and "Bad" and so on.

Please l=
et us=C2=A0know your thoughts on this. If possible try to get Manishji's op=
inion on this as well.

Thanks and Regards,
Girish Sundaram

isdom] Brahmacharya (Re: Regarding Ganapati Homam...)

=C2=A0 
Namaste Bisw=
ajit,

Good luck with homam. Others answered your questions and I will leav=
e them. But I want to say a few words on (3) as the recent discussion on ag=
hora seems to have created some confusion. It is very easy to misunderstand=
 when we are communicating verbally, because one's own mental conditioning =
has a role in deciding how one interprets words, sentences and their sub-te=
xt. It is more so when we are talking about delicate matters.

* * *

> 3. =
When the talking of "AGHORA" going on, is it really needed
> to perform "Br=
amhachariya" for daily ganapati homam?

Brahmacharya is very important in a=
ny spiritual sadhana. Period. As Narayan said, sexual activity results in l=
oss of ojas (subtle vitality) and wastes a part of one's creative essence. =
Doing sadhana without brahmacharya is like filling a water pot that is leak=
ing through a hole. Even if you succeed in filling the pot with water, it w=
ill soon become empty!

Just as a filled water pot that is leaking may stil=
l satisfy the thirst of someone who takes a glass of water from it, similar=
ly a person doing sadhana without brahmacharya may sometimes be able to do =
his dharma and serve his purpose in the world. So, it is a good idea to do =
sadhana even as one's brahmacharya is not good yet. But, the best will be i=
f the filled water pot is not leaking and holds all the water. Similarly, a=
 sadhaka who is accumulating some shakti through sadhana and does not leak =
that energy through acts of lust, anger, greed, jealosy etc will be able to=
 serve dharma better.

If there are 12 people who maintain physical and men=
tal brahmacharya for a few years while doing homam everyday, I think the wo=
rld can be changed.

* * *

If an aghora sits naked with partner and chants=
 mantra, please remember that the goal isn't having sex. This practice is b=
y means a glorification of sex. The goal is to *resist*. Even if the mind i=
s overwhelmed in the beginning with thrill and one ends up having sex, the =
goal is to reach a stage where mind is not looking at nakedness or intimacy=
 as something to be excited about. The goal is to reach a stage where brahm=
acharya can be maintained despite such provocation.

In fact, the true mean=
ing of brahmacharya is not only to refrain from physical sex but also to re=
frain from sexual thoughts in the mind. Many married people of today may be=
 able to set time limits (e.g. 40 days, 100 days, 1 year etc) and maintain =
physical brahmacharya for that time, but it may be difficult to refrain fro=
m mental thoughts.

An aghora tries to incinerate the root cause of those t=
houghts in his mind (what Manish called as "sampradaaha" ). Mind considers =
some things as pure and some things as impure. The "impure" objects and cir=
cumstances are considered impure because they cause thrill or some other di=
sturbance to the mind and waver it from god. But an aghora puts them right =
in the middle of a "pure" activity (e.g. meditation), forcing oneself to de=
al with them. After some time, the impure objects do not cause any thrill o=
r other disturbance to waver the mind from god. Then they are no longer imp=
ure! For example, what is impure about a naked body? The only thing impure =
about it is that it arouses certain thoughts in mind that disturb the mind =
and waver it from god. If a naked body no longer arouses such thoughts, wha=
t is impure about it?

That is the basic thinking in this practice. Some yo=
gis may physically abstain from sex and even stay away from exposure to opp=
osite sex, for several decades. But, if such a person is placed in front of=
 a naked beauty, what thoughts will go on his mind? For all you know, his m=
ind may indeed be disturbed and waver from god. An aghora tries to incinera=
te the very notion in the mind that so and so thing is something to be arou=
sed by, not by staying away from it but by being with it and yet trying to =
focus the mind on god.

Bottomline: An aghora engaging in this practice may=
 stray from brahmacharya in the beginning, but the goal is to attain more p=
erfect brahmacharya later on. The goal of this practice is to attain brahma=
charya.

If one does not keep brahmacharya in the beginning of sadhana, it =
may be ok. But, to really start progressing, one needs to somehow or the ot=
her attain some level of brahmacharya and keep perfecting it.

* * *

The c=
oarse meaning of brahmacharya is physical celibacy.

The finer meaning of b=
rahmacharya is physical celibacy and refraining from any sexual thoughts ev=
en in the mind.

The finest meaning of brahmacharya is refraining from lust=
, anger, greed, delusion, wantonness and jealosy and establishing mind in B=
rahman always. Brahmacharya literally means "engaging in Brahman or Self". =
One experiences lust, anger, greed, jealosy etc only when one's mind percei=
ves and engages with impermanent manifestations of Self (e.g. a beautiful l=
ady, a bad person, a lot of money, a person being appreciated more than me =
etc) and NOT when one's mind engages in true Self. Thus the truest brahmach=
arya comes only on Self-realization. But one can start with physical celiba=
cy and control over anger.

Rome is not built in a day.

Bottomline: It is =
very important to keep brahmacharya, even using the coarse meaning above. S=
tart off with some level of brahmacharya and try to improve it as time goes=
 on. Never be frustrated with lack of progress and keep trying.

* * *

BTW=
, regarding (4), even after fire goes away, you can meditate. Fire will be =
burning in the ember form for a long time. So Agni is still there consuming=
 your offerings, even after it seems like there is no fire.

Keep it as che=
ap as you can, based on your financial level. Little ghee, fallen wood stic=
ks collected manually and some sesame seeds may be all you need.

Best rega=
rds,
Narasimha
