Dear Sundeep,

This is quite relevant and not at all inappropriate. Let me give the crux of 
the philosophy.

*        *        *

The mind is like a monkey. It wanders from one place to another very rapidly 
and gives varied emotions such as pride, shame, anger, sadness etc. When the 
mind becomes nearly calm, steady and stable, one can experience the bliss of 
finding the true Self. The goal of all spiritual sadhana - japam, homam, 
dhyanam, contemplation and various rituals - is to enable the mind to become 
calm.

At first, one cannot make the mind stable and calm. All one can do it to tie 
the monkey (mind) to a fixed pole (mantra). The monkey still moves around, 
but its motion is restricted. Once it goes far, the thread tying it to the 
pole stops it from going further away. Similarly, when one tries to focus on 
a mantra and one's mind wanders to other things, one constantly brings it 
back to the mantra and thus one's mind tries to stay on the mantra.

Thus, mantra is an anchor for the mind to focus on when it tries to become 
calm and stable.

After trying enough, just as monkey tied to a pole may stop jumping around 
and fall asleep holding on to the pole, the mind may stop thinking of so 
many things and become absolutely calm and stable while repeating a mantra. 
When all the thoughts cease and some level of silence comes to the mind, one 
experiences some level of bliss.

*        *        *

Thus, mantra is a combination of sounds that is repeated by the mind to aid 
mind to stop wandering from one thing to another thing. The goal is to give 
an anchor for the mind to focus on, instead of jumping everywhere.

Various sound combinations can be used for this purpose. For example, one 
can even repeat "I want to find true Self" constantly. Every combination of 
sounds is capable of making the mind calm after repeating it enough. Sound 
patterns making sense in various languages were used by some saints and 
messiahs from time to time in the past to obtain bliss and those sound 
patterns are revered as being sacred in various religions.

Compared to long sequence of sounds, short sound patterns are easier to 
focus the mind on. If you repeat a mantra with 32 or 24 letters/syllables, a 
part of the mind is responsible for changing from one letter to another and 
there is more mind activity even in a state of high mental focus on the 
mantra. If you repeat a single syllable constantly, the task is simpler for 
the mind and it is easier for the mind to shut down various tasks of the 
mind and become close to being still and silent.

Various syllables can be used for this purpose. These syllables are called 
beeja aksharas.

*        *        *

Beeja means a seed. Beeja  akshara means a seed syllable.

When mind has absolutely no activity and becomes completely still (i.e. 
ceases to exist!), one realizes the true Self (Aatman or Brahman). When mind 
has very little activity and becomes nearly still (i.e. still exists, but in 
a very high state of focus and calmness), one realizes different pure 
manifestations of cosmic being.

When one meditates on a beeja akshara and attains the above state of high 
mental focus and calmness, one's mind has no thoughts other than the 
repetition of the syllable. Each syllable acts as a seed corresponding to a 
deity. The energy of that deity fills one's consciousness when one's mind is 
filled with that syllable and has no other thoughts in it. In other words, 
each deity is a personifications of the state of a mind that is focused on 
the sound of a specific beeja with no other thoughts in it.

*        *        *

Of course, if one's mind has many thoughts while repeating a beeja akshara 
(or any mantra in general), one may experience a lot of emotions and things. 
But, when one's mind becomes nearly still and calm with no thought in it 
(other than what is needed for repeating that sound), we can say that one's 
individual ego has been replaced with that of a deity and the deity has 
filled one's mind.

Thus, focused meditation on a beeja akshara can make one experience the 
energy of a deity.

*        *        *

Which syllables make one experience which energy was well-understood and 
catalogued by ancient Hindu sages nicely.

Many mantras other than beeja aksharas were also experiemented by rishis, 
who understood the nature of energy experienced by one's mind when one's 
mind is completely filled with the sound of the mantra and all other 
thoughts leave the mind.

So we need not experiment newly. We can use the knowledge discovered by 
rishis and go further.

Best regards,
Narasimha
