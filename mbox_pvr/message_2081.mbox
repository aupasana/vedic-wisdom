Namaste,
 
I approach anything that is not "normal" with skepticism. Though=
 I was given by god my share of extra-ordinary experiences and encounters, =
I still remain a skeptic when I encounter such accounts.
 
I see that this =
world today is filled with crass commercialism and everything is sensationa=
lized and hyped and this calls for healthy skepticism on our part. I do not=
 trust everything I read or hear.
 
*        *        *
 
I have seen some =
special children and young men. Yes, there are some special children born i=
n this world every now and then. There may be more of them at this time. Bu=
t the generalized characteristics mentioned by these writers may not be gen=
uine. Secondly, talking about past lives and distant galaxies or about comi=
ng from a distant galaxy means nothing. Also, it is not really straight-for=
ward to recognize a spiritually special child. What seems special to you is=
 based on your own samskaras! If a boy is indeed from Mars (as some of thes=
e "crystal children" claimed) or even a re-incarnation of a gandharva or a =
kinnara or a vidyadhara etc, it means nothing.
 
Not many recognized Ramakr=
ishna Paramahamsa or Ramana maharshi as a spiritual giant (or as an avatara=
), when they were small boys. Great saints who showed the correct spiritual=
 path to many people exhibited many different characteristics in their chil=
dhood. The characteristics change from one saint to another. A lot of the c=
haracteristics mentioned in the crystal children literature seem irrelevant=
 to me for spiritual purity.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

Re: Miscellany: Future, bestest homam, purity and overcoming ego
 

Dear Na=
rasimhaji,
 
Namaste. This is wonderful. Thank you for sharing these daily =
inspirational gems with us..I feel that your words certainly help us along =
our spiritual journey in some way or another. I got goosebumbs while readin=
g the section about the Dakshina Kaali homam. Incidentally, it reminded me =
of something that I had read before about a concept of 'Crystal Children' -=
 A new generation of children born to ease us into a new era of spiritualit=
y:
 
http://www.amazon.com/Crystal-Children-Doreen-Virtue/dp/1401902294
 
"=
As babies, Crystal Children may take longer than normal to begin talking. T=
hey are highly telepathic, and their tuned-in mothers communicate with them=
 nonverbally. Because they're so sensitive, the Crystal Children babies may=
 fuss and cry a lot in crowded places. They're also very fond of nature. Do=
reen once watched one Crystal Child walk from tree to tree, giving each one=
 a big hug.
 
Crystal Children are beautiful inside and out, like magnifice=
nt little high-priests and priestesses. One look in their eyes, and you'll =
recognize Divine love and wisdom. Their auras are bright, radiant, and opal=
escent-they seem to glow from the inside! They talk about past lives, dista=
nt galaxies, and profound insights concerning peace and love. Most Crystal =
Children's parents are aware that their kids are special, and they're thril=
led to be parenting such delightful children."
