Namaste,
 
My sincere apologies for not replying earlier. Was busy when you=
 sent mail and forgot later. I am sending this to vedic-wisdom after deleti=
ng your name in the mail.
 
(1) The word rakshas means a guardian spirit. T=
he plural form is "rakshaamsi". For example, the dikpalaka (direction ruler=
) of the southwestern direction, Nirriti, is a demon. But he is fulfilling =
an important role. These guardians are clubbed with gods in tarpana.
 
(3) =
Nakshatra birthday is important for the matter of health and longevity. Sup=
pose you want to do a Mrityunjaya homam at the start of what you suspect wi=
ll be a bad year for health and longevity. Then use nakshatra birthday. Tit=
hi is important for overall sense of well-being and prosperity.
 
Both birt=
hdays are important. People advocate what they are used to. Both have their=
 relevance.
 
(4) Using only one darbha is a problem. Whether you use 2 oe =
3 is not a big deal in my view. Do as you please. But it should be more tha=
n one or just skip darbhas.
 
(5) Yes, it is covering this janma also. But =
you are satisfying only the souls that are in need of satisfying by svadhaa=
, as indicated by the word svadhaayin. You need not worry about messing up =
anything with respect to those who are alive.
 
(6) Good suggestion. I will=
 definitely try.
 
(7) Those who believe they can do a good translation are=
 welcome to translate. Our effort has barely started. If She wants, She wil=
l send those who will do what is needed to spread this further. What I am d=
oing is just planting a few seeds as asked by my guru who in turn was comma=
nded by the Mother. Many more people will have to come and play their roles=
 when the time comes, for this to become what the Mother said.
 
(8) It wil=
l. When you make offerings to Agni, Prajapati etc in the external fire, the=
 internal fire (bhutagni) carries those to the Agni and Prajapati within. A=
s the identification with the external fire becomes stronger, bhutagni beco=
mes stronger and purifies more. But calling *some* deity in the fire and ma=
king some offerings is better than simple agnihotra.
 
(9) A by-birth brahm=
ana who wears a sacred thread but does not do any sadhana has no use for th=
e sacred thread. Someone of any caste, if he doing some spiritual sadhana, =
can benefit from wearing a sacred thread.
 
In fact, one who is interested =
in spiritual progress, doing Gayatri mantra everyday or doing homam on a re=
gular basis or doing some other sadhana, automatically becomes a brahmana a=
fter a while.
 
Sacred thread acts as a grounding wire in an electric circu=
it. Until energy starts flowing in the body when mantra is chanted, it has =
no use. Once energy starts flowing, it regulates the flow when worn to be i=
n touch with the spine.
 
If you are chanting Gayatri mantra and doing homa=
m, it is a good idea to wear a sacred thread.
 
(10) No view.
 
*        * =
       *
 
When I made homam manual, I had done homam many days in row, kne=
w several things about homam practically and had a good insight into it. Wh=
en I made the tarpana manual, I did not have much practical experience and =
insight. I was following my guru's command.
 
On the day I was to publish t=
he tarpana manual, I went to the Mahalakshmi idol next to my homa kundam an=
d prayed to Her, "O Mother, I am not really an authority on tarpana. But, w=
ith the intention of people benefiting from it, I made this manual as asked=
 by my guru. Please bless this effort. I will perform a tarpana now strictl=
y following this document. Please give me a visible sign if you are blessin=
g this effort and giving a go ahead". I sat down to perform tarpana. The mo=
ment I called gods and rishis into kalasam, there was a really heavy wind. =
It was sunny that whole morning with not many clouds. It had not rained for=
 a few days. But the moment I made the second tarpana and said "om vishnuh =
tripyataam", suddenly it started raining. It was not heavy rain, but light =
rain with really large drops of rain water that slowly turned into a regula=
r rain and continued for the rest of the day. Rain with large drops is cons=
idered auspicious in tradition. Like this, the Mother gave me some good sig=
ns and gave me confidence that Her blessings were with us on this effort.
 =

Obviously, She wants some people to benefit from the practice of tarpana a=
nd homam. That is why She is doing all this through us.
 
Best regards,
Nar=
asimha

          Date: Sunday, October 12, 2008, 11:19 AM
                Dear Nar=
asimha Rao garu,

                Namaste.

                Here are the ot=
her doubts that I had earlier, but did not ask since I wanted to check with=
 you only on the absolute must for performing tarpana on that day.  Can you=
 please clarify them ?

                [Some of them are not related to Ta=
rpana, but I thought instead of sending a different mail, I will ask all of=
 them in one]

                1) In Deva tarpana, I see we are offering ta=
rpana to pisaachas (and I see a word "rakshaamsi" - assuming it is for raak=
shasas). Why are we offering tarpana to the bad souls ? Even if we offer th=
em say out of pity or so, should we be giving them so much importance that =
we are offereing them along with Devas and before rishis and our own pitris=
 ?

                2) What is the significance of not doing tarpna on the =
specific days with specific thithis. (This is just out of my curiousity, if=
 you feel it needs a lot of depth, please ignore)

                3) You m=
entioned that we should not perfrom tarpana on our Birthday. I am thoroughl=
y confused on when we should celebrate our Birthday. Tamils and Karalites c=
elebrate based on their birth star. One priest told me Andhra and Karnataka=
 people celebrate as per thithi. So I chose thithi. But some other priest t=
old me tithis should be used only for observing deaths not for births.

   =
             Which one should I follow (I'm from Andhra Pradesh) ?

       =
         4) A local priest told me that we should be holding two darbas and=
 not three. I'm assuming this is just a difference on the tradition and no =
harm with 3 either.

                5) For the obvious traditional beliefs=
, all the priests here strongly discouraged me from doing pitri tarpana (th=
ey are okay with Deva and Rishi tarpana) since my parents are alive. Howeve=
r my father was convinced with the explanation you gave in the doc and gave=
 his consent. So I proceeded.

                But I still have some slight=
 discomfort. The Mantra says 'Sarva Janmeshu ....' Is n't this covering thi=
s Janma also ?

                6) It would be good if you could make a vid=
eo of the presentation and upload. I was confused about how to hold the dar=
bas and did in the way I understood. Actually this is one request I have fo=
r your homa too. Some times we interpret the statements incorrectly and som=
etimes when we start following the doc, we get a different doubt. With the =
video, it is clear.

                This is one of the reasons why I wante=
d to meet you when you were in India, so I can learn doing homa directly un=
der you. But for some reason it did not work out. If you could make a video=
, that would help people like me a lot. 

                7) How about maki=
ng translations of your Homa and Tarpana in different languages ? For examp=
le my father does not know english and all of sudden, he wanted to perform =
agnihotra after hearing about it by someone that it purifies atmosphere. Lu=
ckily I had a book on agnihotra by the Akkalkot ashram in Telugu and mailed=
 him.

                Similarly when I told him about Mahalaya Amavasya, h=
e wanted to perform tarpana but no manual for him. 

                8) Wha=
t is the role of Agnihotra ? Will it too purify out bhootagni or it is just=
 for offering food to Agni, Surya and Prajapati ?

                9) What =
is the significance of the sacred-thread ? What is your opinion on non-brah=
mins wearing that ? If am already chanting Gayatri mantra(as per your proce=
dure - Om Bhur.. one time, and ensclosing 'tat savi..' in Om at beginning a=
nd end every time we chant), do you think I will get additional benefit in =
wearing the sacred thread and getting initiated in to Gayatri. (the person =
who is initiating is most probably not a sadhaka and I don't think will be =
giving me any part of his mantra sidhi. Plus he is a simple priest and I ha=
ve no plans to treat him as my Guru and so I do not want to take his power =
even if he is willing to give me)To me he is just a qualified person to giv=
e sacred thread with a liberal view towards it.

                10) Finall=
y, there is a belief that marriages should not be performed till 1 year whe=
re there was a death. Somewhere I read that after 10 (or 11) days the soul =
leaves the place and begins its journey. So I don't see why this rule was t=
here. Can you please let me know your view on this ?

                Thank=
s and Regards,
                <deleted>

                <DIV>Here are the oth=
er doubts that I had earlier, but did not 
                ask since I want=
ed to check with you only on the absolute must 
                for perform=
ing tarpana on that day.  Can you please clarify 
                them=
 ?</DIV>

                <DIV>[Some of them are not related to Tarpana, but I tho=
ught 
                instead of sending a different mail, I will ask all o=

                <DIV>1) In Deva tarpana, I =
see we are offering tarpana to 
                pisaachas (and I see a word=
 "rakshaamsi" - assuming it is for 
                raakshasas). Why are we=
 offering tarpana to the bad souls ? Even 
                if we offer them=
 say out of pity or so, should we be giving them 
                so much i=
mportance that we are offereing them along with Devas 
                and =
before rishis and our own pitris ?</DIV>
                <DIV><FONT face=3D=
Arial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
                <DIV>2) What is the sign=
ificance of not doing tarpna on the 
                specific days with spe=
cific thithis. (This is just out of my 
                curiousity, if you =
feel it needs a lot of depth, please 
                ignore)</DIV>

             =
   <DIV>3) You mentioned that we should not perfrom tarpana on our 
       =
         Birthday. I am thoroughly confused on when we should celebrate 
  =
              our Birthday. Tamils and Karalites celebrate based on their 
=
                birth star. One priest told me Andhra and Karnataka people =

                celebrate as per thithi. So I chose thithi. But some other=
 
                priest told me tithis should be used only for observing d=
eaths 
                not for births.</DIV>
                <DIV><FONT fac=
e=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
                <DIV>Which one shoul=
d I follow (I'm from Andhra Pradesh) ?</DIV>
                <DIV><FONT fac=
e=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
                <DIV>4) A local prie=
st told me that we should be holding two 
                darbas and not th=
ree. I'm assuming this is just a difference on 
                the traditi=
on and no harm with 3 either.</DIV>
                <DIV><FONT face=3DArial=
 size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
                <DIV>5) For the obvious tradi=
tional beliefs, all the priests 
                here strongly discouraged =
me from doing pitri tarpana (they are 
                okay with Deva and R=
ishi tarpana) since my parents are alive. 
                However my fathe=
r was convinced with the explanation you gave in 
                the doc a=
nd gave his consent. So I proceeded.</DIV>
                <DIV><FONT face=
=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
                <DIV>But I still have=
 some slight discomfort. The Mantra says 
                'Sarva Janmeshu .=
...' Is n't this covering this Janma also 
                ?</DIV>

              =
  <DIV>6) It would be good if you could make a video of the 
              =
  presentation and upload. I was confused about how to hold the 
          =
      darbas and did in the way I understood. Actually this is one 
       =
         request I have for your homa too. Some times we interpret the 
   =
             statements incorrectly and sometimes when we start following t=
he 
                doc, we get a different doubt. With the video, it is 
c=
lear.</DIV>
                <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> <=
/DIV>
                <DIV>This is one of the reasons why I wanted to meet =
you when 
                you were in India, so I can learn doing homa dire=
ctly under you. 
                But for some reason it did not work out. I=
f you could make a 
                video, that would help people like me a=
 lot. </DIV>
                <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> =
</DIV>
                <DIV>7) How about making translations of your Homa a=
nd Tarpana 
                in different languages ? For example my father =
does not know 
                english and all of sudden, he wanted to perf=
orm agnihotra after 
                hearing about it by someone that it pu=
rifies atmosphere. Luckily 
                I had a book on agnihotra by th=
e Akkalkot ashram in Telugu and 
                mailed him.</DIV>
        =
        <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
              =
  <DIV>Similarly when I told him about Mahalaya Amavasya, he 
             =
   wanted to perform tarpana but no manual for him. </DIV>
                =
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
                <DIV>8=
) What is the role of Agnihotra ? Will it too purify out 
                b=
hootagni or it is just for offering food to Agni, Surya and 
              =
  Prajapati ?</DIV>

                <DIV>9) What is the significance of the sacre=
d-thread ? What is 
                your opinion on non-brahmins wearing th=
at ? If am already 
                chanting Gayatri mantra(as per your pro=
cedure - Om Bhur.. one 
                time, and ensclosing 'tat savi..' i=
n Om at beginning and end 
                every time we chant), do you thi=
nk I will get additional benefit 
                in wearing the sacred thr=
ead and getting initiated in to 
                Gayatri. (the person who i=
s initiating is most probably not a 
                sadhaka and I don't th=
ink will be giving me any part of his 
                mantra sidhi. Plus h=
e is a simple priest and I have no plans to 
                treat him as m=
y Guru and so I do not want to take his power even 
                if he i=
s willing to give me)To me he is just a qualified person 
                t=

0) Finally, there is a belief that marriages should not be 
               =
 performed till 1 year where there was a death. Somewhere I read 
         =
       that after 10 (or 11) days the soul leaves the place and begins 
   =
             its journey. So I don't see why this rule was there. Can you

                please let me know your view on this ?</DIV>
