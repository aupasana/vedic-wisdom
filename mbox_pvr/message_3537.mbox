Thank you for your advise that has so much clari=

have seen that message in some of your previous emails too. They say that K=
aliYuga length is 432,000 years=C2=A0out of which only 5000+ years have pas=
sed. Are we at a point already that we can say that Kali is deepening?

Namaste,

We tell a young student to study well and get good=
 scores in examinations. We tell him that he should go to so and so institu=
tion (e.g. IIT, IISc, , REC, IIM etc). But we know that going to IIT or get=
ting 90% score in exams is NOT the goal of education. The goal of education=
 is to understand the subject well and have a good career. It is possible t=
o get 90% score without understanding well and it is possible to go to IIT =
and not understand the subject well.

Similarly, the goal of spiritual sadh=
ana is to get better control over mind, overcome the internal enemies as mu=
ch as possible and become liberated. But, we tell people to do so and so ri=
tuals, follow so and so procedures/formulas , go to so and so temple etc.

=
Some formulas were created so that there is some structure to sadhana. But =
there is nothing absolute about those formulas.

Yes, if your gurus told yo=
u the formula of n times japam, n/10 times homam, n/100 times tarpana etc a=
nd you want to follow it, please do so. No harm in it. Some people believe =
that such a procedure gives "siddhi" in a mantra.

However, please note tha=
t there are many people who did purascharanas using such formulas and did n=
ot really get any "siddhi" in the mantra. On the other hand, there are peop=
le who did not stick to those formulas and yet found god through the mantra=
.

In my opinion, you can do just japam with a mantra without worrying abou=
t 1/10th count homam, 1/100th count tarpana etc. Or you can also do a mantr=
a entirely in homam without any japam or tarpana. Choose one practice and d=
o it until your mind is so absorbed in it that your mind is chanting that m=
antra sub-consciously when it is free (like some people hum catchy songs wh=
en they are free).

=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

Regarding the astrological formulas fo=
r evaluating the impact of a mantra, I would like disown those concepts ori=
ginally taught by Pt Sanjay Rath and shared by me in my astrology classes. =
There are many technicalities, but many many corruptions in the way knowled=
ge is preserved. Most rules and technicalities of mantra shashtra apply to =
people who do prayogas to get specific material results (and naturally thos=
e rules have been intentionally corrupted by Nature in preparation of deepe=
ning Kali).

Bottomline is that a mantra done for spiritual progress works =
based on your mental visualization of the mantra and its deity and the late=
nt forces of conditioning in your mind. All the house calculations based on=
 the numbers of letters and number of words are irrelevant. Moreover, a ved=
a mantra like Gayatri mantra can be done by anyone without worrying about t=
echnicalities.

Regarding adding "Om" or "Om Bhur bhuvas suvah" or Om bhuh =
om bhuvah om suvah om mahah.." etc, there are many standard approaches. I s=
uggest using what you were taught by your gurus and not worrying too much a=
bout it.

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

Utpal asked about count vs time. Counts sometim=
es force people to speed things up. In my humble opinion, it is fine or eve=
n better to set a time limit (e.g. one hour, two hours etc) and do japam fo=
r that time irrespective of the count.

Narasimha

Narasimhagaru, 
=C2=A0
Thank you for=
 such a nice explanation. Even with not maintaining Brahmacharya, I could s=
ee significant progress in terms of my control of temper etc. when I did Ga=
yatri Japam in the past. Did not know the significance of Brahmacharya then=
 (in future I will practise with Brahmacharya) . But the way I did was it w=
as one a lakh purascharana (daily 1000-3000 times) for a period of two mont=
hs and then I did a homam to complete the dasamsa in homam. For the homam, =
however, I have called about 10 people (Grihastas / Brahmacharis altogether=
) and we all did chant the mantra while I performed the homam. This is how =
our Sharmaji instructed us to do. So, is a Dasamsa homam, satamsa for tarpa=
nam, sahasramsa for marjanam and finally dasamsa of shasramsa for feeding t=
he number of brahmins (so basically, for a laksha Gayatri, 10 brahmins must=
 be fed, to finish the ritual of purascharana) . This is how I thought the =
big japams must be done. Can you shed more light on
 this? 
=C2=A0
Also, Ga=
yatri mantra is a 24 syllable mantra starting with tatsavitur.. .., but if =
the vyahritis are added it becomes a 30 letter mantra (om bhur bhu va ssu v=
ah=C2=A0). How should this be practised? 30, I suppose strengthens the 6th =
house, whereas the 24 strengthens the 12th house, according to your explana=
tion? Sorry for digressing into astrology ! (but they are tightly integrate=
d here and could not avoid this question). Please tell me if my interpretat=
ion is right and also please tell me which approach is better.

Nam=
aste,

What he wrote was to do Savitri Gayatri mantra 1000 times everyday i=
n one sitting and do like that for 100 days at a stretch without break. The=
n possibly give a break for a few days and do for another 100 days. Like th=
at, do for 3 stretches of 100 days each.

Of course, if needs no break, one=
 can do 300 days in a row too. But, keeping brahmacharya (abstinence) may b=
e difficult for some people and hence the suggestion of the break.

For suc=
cess in any sadhana, brahmacharya is very important. Restraint from sex and=
 control of anger and short-temper will help one avoid leakage of shakti (p=
urifying energy). Everytime one experiences lust, anger etc, one loses some=
 shakti.

Every factor contributes a little to success. Beard is useful. Th=
e tradition of growing beard exists in many religions and it is not without=
 a reason. We discussed this sometime back.

If one is living a lifestyle w=
here one avoids contact with any tempting situations altogether (e.g. livin=
g in a remote monastery), beard may or may not add much value. But, if one =
is living a lifestyle where one comes in contact with tempting situations r=
egularly (e.g. living in the modern world with a family and job and a TV), =
beard can be very useful. As I said earlier when we discussed this, beard i=
s not the complete solution but a small part of the solution. Just as a rai=
ling on the side of a hill road may stop a slowly moving car from sliding o=
ff the hill at night but be unable to stop a fast moving car out of control=
, similarly a beard can help a person with decent control over the mind to =
retain control in some tricky situations.

Trimming beard is ok.

=C2=A0 *

If one indeed does 1000 times Gayatri (or any mantra for a couple=
 of hours) everyday for one year while maintaining brahmacharya, 
while fol=
lowing the simple rules of same place, same time everyday and facing the sa=
me direction, one will certainly make good progress. Brahmacharya is one ke=
y thing and sitting still with an erect back, neck and head with the eyes c=
losed is the other thing. The probability of mind becoming still is almost =
zero if the body is not still. If the body can be kept very still, there is=
 a chance that mind will also become still for a moment. If the mind is sti=
ll for even a moment, it will cause great bliss. As mind gets more used to =
being still, it will become still more often and for longer times. Then var=
ious kinds of samadhis become possible.

Narasimha

This is a great mail and very inspirin=
g. However, I have one question on Sri Manishji's advise on how to carry ou=
t the sadhana. He says do it for 100 days and repeat the whole procedure fo=
r 3 times. So, should we do 3000 times japam in a day for 100 days or do 10=
00 times every day for=C2=A0300 days? He also says 'Grow a beard'. Now, in =
a professional corporate life, that could be a difficult thing. How about t=
rimming it?.... just to be tolerable to other people. Maybe my question is =
silly but it is genuine.

e who did not stick to those formulas and yet found god through the mantra.=
<BR><BR>In my opinion, you can do just japam with a mantra without worrying=
 about 1/10th count homam, 1/100th count tarpana etc. Or you can also do a =
mantra entirely in homam without any japam or tarpana. Choose one practice =
and do it until your mind is so absorbed in it that your mind is chanting t=
hat mantra sub-consciously when it is free (like some people hum catchy son=
gs when they are free).<BR><BR>*        =
*        *<BR><BR>Regarding the astrolog=
ical formulas for evaluating
 the impact of a mantra, I would like disown t=
hose concepts originally taught by Pt Sanjay Rath and shared by me in my as=
trology classes. There are many technicalities, but many many corruptions i=
n the way knowledge is preserved. Most rules and technicalities of mantra s=
hashtra apply to people who do prayogas to get specific material results (a=
nd naturally those rules have been intentionally corrupted by Nature in pre=
paration of deepening Kali).<BR><BR>Bottomline is that a mantra done for sp=
iritual progress works based on your mental visualization of the mantra and=
 its deity and the latent forces of conditioning in your mind. All the hous=
e calculations based on the numbers of letters and number of words are irre=
levant. Moreover, a veda mantra like Gayatri mantra can be done by anyone w=
ithout worrying about technicalities.<BR><BR>Regarding adding "Om" or "Om B=
hur bhuvas suvah" or Om bhuh om bhuvah om suvah om mahah.." etc, there are =
many standard
 approaches. I suggest using what you were taught by your gur=
us and not worrying too much about it.<BR><BR>*    &nbs=
p;   *        *<BR><BR>Utpal a=
sked about count vs time. Counts sometimes force people to speed things up.=
 In my humble opinion, it is fine or even better to set a time limit (e.g. =
one hour, two hours etc) and do japam for that time irrespective of the cou=
nt.<BR><BR>Best regards,<BR>Narasimha<BR>------------ --------- --------- -=

Narasimhagaru, </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Thank you for such a nice expl=
anation. Even with not maintaining Brahmacharya, I could see significant pr=
ogress in terms of my control of temper etc. when I did Gayatri Japam in th=
e past. Did not know the significance of Brahmacharya then (in future I wil=
l practise with Brahmacharya) . But the way I did was it was one a lakh pur=
ascharana (daily 1000-3000 times) for a period of two months and then I did=
 a homam to complete the dasamsa in homam. For the homam, however, I have c=
alled about 10 people (Grihastas / Brahmacharis altogether) and we all did =
chant the mantra while I performed the homam. This is how our Sharmaji inst=
ructed us to do. So, is a Dasamsa homam, satamsa for tarpanam, sahasramsa f=
or marjanam and finally dasamsa of shasramsa for feeding the number of brah=
mins (so basically, for a laksha Gayatri, 10 brahmins must be fed, to finis=
h the ritual of purascharana) . This is how I thought the big japams must b=
e done. Can you shed more light
 on this? </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Als=
o, Gayatri mantra is a 24 syllable mantra starting with tatsavitur.. .., bu=
t if the vyahritis are added it becomes a 30 letter mantra (om bhur bhu va =
ssu vah ). How should this be practised? 30, I suppose strengthens the=
 6th house, whereas the 24 strengthens the 12th house, according to your ex=
planation? Sorry for digressing into astrology ! (but they are tightly inte=
grated here and could not avoid this question). Please tell me if my interp=
retation is right and also please tell me which approach is better. </DIV>

<TD vAlign=3Dtop>Namaste,<BR><BR>W=
hat he wrote was to do Savitri Gayatri mantra 1000 times everyday in one si=
tting and do like that for 100 days at a stretch without break. Then possib=
ly give a break for a few days and do for another 100 days. Like that, do f=
or 3 stretches of 100 days each.<BR><BR>Of course, if needs no break, one c=
an do 300 days in a row too. But, keeping brahmacharya (abstinence) may be =
difficult for some people and hence the suggestion of the break.<BR><BR>For=
 success in any sadhana, brahmacharya is very important. Restraint from sex=
 and control of anger and short-temper will help one avoid leakage of shakt=
i (purifying energy). Everytime one experiences lust, anger etc, one loses =
some shakti.<BR><BR>Every factor contributes a little to success. Beard is =
useful. The tradition of growing beard exists in many religions and it is n=
ot without a reason. We discussed this sometime back.<BR><BR>If one is livi=
ng a lifestyle where one avoids
 contact with any tempting situations altog=
ether (e.g. living in a remote monastery), beard may or may not add much va=
lue. But, if one is living a lifestyle where one comes in contact with temp=
ting situations regularly (e.g. living in the modern world with a family an=
d job and a TV), beard can be very useful. As I said earlier when we discus=
sed this, beard is not the complete solution but a small part of the soluti=
on. Just as a railing on the side of a hill road may stop a slowly moving c=
ar from sliding off the hill at night but be unable to stop a fast moving c=
ar out of control, similarly a beard can help a person with decent control =
over the mind to retain control in some tricky situations.<BR><BR>Trimming =
beard is ok.<BR><BR>*        * &nbs=
p;      *<BR><BR>If one indeed does 1000 times Gay=
atri (or any mantra for a couple of hours) everyday for one year while main=
taining brahmacharya,
 <BR>while following the simple rules of same place, =
same time everyday and facing the same direction, one will certainly make g=
ood progress. Brahmacharya is one key thing and sitting still with an erect=
 back, neck and head with the eyes closed is the other thing. The probabili=
ty of mind becoming still is almost zero if the body is not still. If the b=
ody can be kept very still, there is a chance that mind will also become st=
ill for a moment. If the mind is still for even a moment, it will cause gre=
at bliss. As mind gets more used to being still, it will become still more =
often and for longer times. Then various kinds of samadhis become possible.=

<DIV>This is a=
 great mail and very inspiring. However, I have one question on Sri Manishj=
i's advise on how to carry out the sadhana. He says do it for 100 days and =
repeat the whole procedure for 3 times. So, should we do 3000 times japam i=
n a day for 100 days or do 1000 times every day for 300 days? He also =
says 'Grow a beard'. Now, in a professional corporate life, that could be a=
 difficult thing. How about trimming it?.... just to be tolerable to other =
people. Maybe my question is silly but it is genuine. </DIV>
