Namaste friends,
 
Excellent and inspirational writeup Narayan!
 
*        *        *
 
Earlier, I mentioned the Mother's instruction to Manish when She appeared in front of him at the temple in Chennai during Shata Chandi homam, to spread the practice of regular homam around the world. However, Manish did not reveal that incident to me until much later. All he told me at that time was that Narayan really needed to do homam everyday and that I should teach a simple procedure to him.
 
I experimented with homam, started doing occasionally and liked it. I started doing a quick procedure everyday. After doing it daily for a few months, I finally got down to the original task - teaching Narayan. I chose to write a detailed manual for that purpose. In hindsight, I made the correct choice, as many people in addition to Narayan are able to do homam using the manual now! I and many other people have benefited (and will benefit). However, as far as my mind concerned, all this started for Narayan! When it was time for Narayan to start doing homam, many people across the world started with him. What a fortunate soul..
 
*        *        *
 
It was probably for a reason that Manish did not tell me at the onset itself what the Mother asked him to do. My attitude and mental state would've been different while working on the manual. I would've been more egoistic and also hurried more. Because the only thing I was told was to teach Narayan, I took my sweet time, arrived at the correct balance and also wrote it down without many pretensions. The whole effort ended up being more saattwik and I really benefited from the exercise. If I had known the full story, it would have had more rajas given my mental state then and I would not have had made the same progress I made, while preparing myself to teach homam to Narayan.
 
Manish told me the full story only when I was better prepared to handle the information and, of course, I added it to the preface of the manual as asked by him then.
 
*        *        *
 
A good guru protects a sishya from unnecessary information that can wreak havoc with the ego. I remember another incident.
 
One day in the spring of the same year, I decided to spend a whole day meditating with Gayatri mantra during the coming weekend. The inspiration came out of nowhere and I immediately latched on to it. When I told Manish, he only said "good, go ahead and do it". I started before sunrise and went on till 9:30 pm. Except for 3-4 breaks of 2 min, a 20 min break at noon for bath and a small lunch and another 10 min break for another bath at dusk, I was basically sitting in the same place and meditating with Gayatri mantra. It was a very good experience. I was in a very nice state at the end of the day.
 
I noticed on the next day that the previous day was Akshaya Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya). It is considered a very auspicious day and it is believed that spiritual sadhana on that day is 1000 times more powerful than on other days. Though I had not noticed it before, I picked a perfect day for the sadhana. I was excited. When I mentioned this to Manish with excitement a few days later, he said calmly "I knew it earlier itself. But I did not tell you because knowing it would've distracted you. You would have been excited at doing the sadhana on Akshaya Triteeya and that excitement would've changed the mental focus and brought more rajas into the sadhana."
 
He was absolutely right. As such, I was "proud" of doing such a sadhana. The ego and pride brought rajas and limited the mental focus on the mantra. If I was aware that I was doing this sadhana on a powerful day, it would've increased the pride and excitement, brought in rajas  and reduced the saattwik focus on mantra further. Ego is a very dangerous entity. Even after one makes excellent progress, it can suddenly return and pull one down! After hearing Manish's words, I introspected and found that my ego was still alive and kicking and that he was wise not to feed it with more delicious food!
 
Lucky are those who have a guru who can succintly tell them what is useful rather than what sounds good. Lucky are those who have a guru (or someone else) who can go to the heart of their problem and point it out, so that they can weed it out through further introspection and weaken it through conscious effort.
 
*        *        *
 
I remember one more similar incident. Before the shata chandi homam in early 2006, a priest we respect a lot took me to a Siddha (a perfected/advanced soul). When he looked at me, he mentioned the name of one of the saptarshis and said that I very close to him and that I would do some important work in this birth.
 
When I saw Manish later that day, I mentioned this to him. He immediately became serious and said "Narasimha, do you need one more identity? Your ego is already strong with the identity of 'Narasimha, the Sanskrit scholar', 'Narasimha, the astrologer', 'Narasimha, the engineer', 'Narasimha, the spiritual seeker' etc. It will take great effort to overcome those identities and find True Self. As if that challenge is not sufficient, do you really need yet another new identity to feed your ego further? See, what he said may very well be correct. But it is not useful for your progress. You have to rise above all identities."
 
How true and wise!
 
*        *        *
 
Just as a fat and mighty dog may win over a lean and weak dog and get all the food given by the master, ahamkara (ego or the sense of "I") within us wins over the spirit of detachment and gets all the energy possible. Just as a good master may chain the fat dog and feed the lean dog specially, we too must consciously try to restrain ego and increase detachment.
 
Manish has a unique way of looking at things and some simple points he made brought so much clarity to my thinking and sped up my spiritual evolution in this life. Even without giving any specific mantra to me, like many spiritual gurus do, he lit the lamp of knowledge in my heart. He would say the lamp and light were already there and he simply wiped the dust on the lamp that was blocking the light. That is what a good guru does. He/She wipes off the thick layer of dirt (conditioning by gunas) on the glass (ego) that encloses the lamp (Self) that is lit in the heart. Sometimes, we may be too caught up to notice that dirt ourselves..
 
*        *        *
 
Homam and other spiritual sadhana tools are very helpful. But one should also try to introspect and change one's thinking, on an ongoing basis. There is no magic pill. For most people, this does not take just a single moment or day or month or year. It CAN take a long time. As Narayan indicated, one should start walking on the path and not worry about the progress and the distance left. One who keeps walking without distractions will reach the goal.
 
The point I want to emphasize is that the external rituals (like homam) and the internal introspection (to change attitude) should go hand in hand. After a while, there will be synergy between them and they will start to work together very effectively.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
