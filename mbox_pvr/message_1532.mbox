Namaste friends,
 
I am in Seoul, South Korea on office work for a week. I will not be able to send too many mails from here. I will write some quick points on this topic.
 
Apart from the link given by Ravi, another relevant article is:
 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/757
 
It talks about the best way to chant a mantra when doing japam vs when doing homam. Please read it.
 
*        *        *
 
Some people chant Gayatri mantra loud, while many traditional people do it silently.
 
If one has experienced something with a mantra and chants it loud and lets other people hear it, some of the shakti is transmitted to other people. It is for this reason that getting a mantra from a guru's mouth is considered useful (assuming that guru has accumulated some shakti with the mantra).
 
It is always a good idea to keep some mantras to yourself, as you do sadhana. In my case, Savitru Gayatri mantra gives me spiritual food and I am selfish with just that mantra.
 
Which mantras to say loud and share with all and which mantras to keep personal can be an individual decision. It depends on which mantras are giving you some results.
 
*        *        *
 
When I chant Gayatri mantra in japam, I chant it without lips or vocal cords having ANY motion. Of course, still someone can "listen". For example, when I met my guru in 2005, he made me do japam in front of him and made a correction at the end. Gross sound is heard using gross perception (ears) and subtle sound is heard using subtle perception.
 
When I offer Gayatri mantra in fire, I chant it with a small movement of vocal cords. Some minimal vaikhari sound is produced. It is enough for the external fire to hear (at the gross level), but not enough for most people to hear with their ears. Though I am spending some energy in producing vaikhari sound (as opposed to using all the energy for producing subtler levels), it is not a wastage. This small vaikhari sound reaches fire and fire then magnifies it. The subtle sound generated by fire is higher than the subtle sound I can generate normally.
 
*        *        *
 
As Ajit correctly said, adding swaahaa to veda mantras may require some modification of intonation at the end. As he advised, seek advice from elders or gurus. If that is not possible, I suggest adding swaahaa after a small break. Say the mantra, then give a small break and then say "swaahaa". In the case of Gayatri mantra, I can suggest the following:
 
"Om <small break> tatsavitur .... prachodayaat <small break> Om swaahaa"
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

When you are doing japam, however, it is better if there is no movement of the lips also.

Once you get the mantra, it is much easier when we pronounce it loud. It takes much more effort to pronounce it completely mentally while keeping the correct swara.
