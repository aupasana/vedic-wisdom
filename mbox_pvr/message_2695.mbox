Namaste,
 
I am only addressing the five elements mentioned in upanishads.
=
 
In Sahasrara chakra lies undifferentiated consciousness (Brahman or Aatma=
n), where there are no I-ness or any objectification. Just below it, there =
are several lokas that people do not mention normally. In Aajnaa chakra lie=
s the primordial state of the universe where there is just space and time, =
but no five elements. From visuddhi chakra to moolaadhaara chakra lie the e=
lements of ether, air, fire, water and earth as I mentioned. I only focused=
 on the last five stages.
 
What happens between Sahasrara and Aajnaa is kn=
own only to greatest of seers. It is true that several yogis can be establi=
shed in Sahasrara, where there is no ego and no objectification. However, v=
ery very very few can understand what happens in the chakras just below Sah=
asrara and above Aajnaa, where there is still I-ness and objectification, b=
ut at a very very high level that is beyond the play of elements.
 
There i=
s a lot more happening between Sahasrara and Aajnaa than elsewhere, but we =
are not well-equipped to understand it...
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

ng is also consistent with chakra based understanding of Tantra. The five c=
hakras downwards from Visuddhi chakra to Moolaadhaara chakra represent ethe=
r, air, fire, water and earth. When Kundalini leaves Moolaadhaara, earth el=
ement within one is surrendered, i.e. all traces of earth element are effac=

ement within one is surrendered, i.e. all traces of water element are effac=
ed in one's self-awareness. And so on.
> >

n't just think of physical earth and physical water etc. Earth element show=
s a solid state of existence. Water element shows a flexible and fluid stat=
e of existence. For example, an idea that one "owns" a particular thing (e.=
g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of solid state and made o=
f earth element. An idea that one "needs" a particular thing (e.g. a car, a=
 house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of the nature of water element. Thus=
, different mental concepts and ideas can be mapped to the five elements.

As much as I could fathom (I am no physicist, neither do I have the ability=
 to penetrate the mathematics of the M-Theory), as it stands now, it is qui=
te half formed. There being multiple theories of the String variety, adhere=
d to by multiple physicists, the M-Theory (11 dimensional one) is one of th=
e many which 'claim to explain' in parts some aspects of the physical world=
. Finding a correlation between this and the idea of the five elements, in =
my humble opinion, is still far fetched. I can understand some correlation =
between basic Quantum Mechanics, (at least the Copenhegan Interpretation), =
non-locality etc, and the ideas of Indian mysticism, but a link between M-t=
heory of panch-mahabhuta?!..

The idea of the pach mahabhuta and creation is almost the essence of everyt=
