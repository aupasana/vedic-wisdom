Namaste,

First of all, our current understanding of arriving at ishta devata from 
horoscope is not perfect.

Secondly, the way ishta devata may work is complex. The role of ishta devata 
is to give moksha. Moksha is the state of non-distinction between objects of 
universe. "Supreme cosmic being" (known by various names) is the observer of 
all with non-distinction and the gate to moksha. Several deities play 
specific roles in the universe at the lower level and become one with 
supreme cosmic being at a higher level. Accordingly, one may start praying 
to a specific form of a deity with a specific role in the universe, later 
realize a higher form of the deity and then become liberated through that 
higher form.

For this reason, some (especially some gurus at Sri Jagannath Centre) even 
say that only Vishnu's incarnations can be ishta devatas giving moksha and 
other deities cannot be. This is partly logical, but based on a 
misconception. Vishnu here refers to sarva vyaapakeswara (all-pervading 
lord). If one realizes an all-pervading form of Ganesha or Surya or Lakshmi 
or Kaali or Shiva or Subrahmanya, then too that form qualifies as ishta 
devata who enables moksha (liberation). For example, Ganapathi Atharva 
Seersham describes a supreme cosmic being form of Ganapathi, from whom 
Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva come. Suryopanishat describes a supreme cosmic 
being form of Surya, from whom Brahma, Vishn and Shiva come. And so on.

One may start with the worship of Ganesha who removes obstacles and finally 
realize a form of Ganesha that is beyond gunas and from whom Brahma, Vishnu, 
Shiva, Surya, Agni, Vaayu etc are born. One may start with the worship of 
Lakshmi who gives prosperity and money and finally realize a form of Lakshmi 
who drives the thoughts and actions of all beings. One may start with the 
worship of Saraswati who gives knowledge and finally realize a form of 
Saraswati who is the root of all creation.

Thus, one starts worshipping one's ishta devata and slowly evolves to 
worshipping a higher all-pervading form of that deity, who may sometimes 
seem like a different deity to a casual observer. This is the natural 
process of evolution.

*        *        *

Saptashati rahasya associated with saptashati (Chandipath) describes the 
process of creation. It says that first there was Mahalakshmi with three 
gunas. She divided herself into 3 parts - Mahakali with tamas (ichchhaa 
sakti - the force behind desire), Mahalakshmi with sattwa (jnaana sakti - 
the force behind knowledge) and Mahasaraswati (kriyaa sakti - the force 
behind action) with rajas. The 3 parts of Chandipath are devoted to the 
three.

Thus, trigunatmika Mahalakshmi is the root energy driving the 
desires/thoughts, knowledge/perception and actions of all beings in this 
universe.

In fact, chapter 11 towards the end of Chandipath prays to Devi (divine 
Mother) after all her exploits and addresses Her in the prayer as 
"Naaraayani" (energy of Narayana). If one views Naaraayana as supreme cosmic 
being from whom Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva came, trigunatmika Mahalakshami (or 
Narayani) is his energy.

Thus, the Divine Mother of Chandipath is not really different from 
Mahalakshmi I have been worshipping for many years. I originally started out 
worshipping Lakshmi with 4 hands who sita on a lotus and gives money. I 
later realized that a higher form of the same deity is the energy of 
Narayana (supreme cosmic being) and She is responsible for the birth, 
sustenance and destruction of all beings including Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.

*        *        *

Whichever deity you are attached to and worship as your ishta devata, please 
try to imagine that deity as the all-pervading supreme cosmic being from 
whom the entire creation evolves.

Best regards,
Narasimha
