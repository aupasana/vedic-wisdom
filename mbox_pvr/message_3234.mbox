dear shri narasimha,
Wonderful explanation. These in depth explanations are=
 sufficient
for the meat eaters to think whether it is required to kill ani=
mals just to
fulfill the taste of our palate. After all the taste buds are =
just located
only on a few sqaure inch area on our toungue. If the cravings=
 of the
taste buds can be controlled by our mind then we will not involve 
=
ourselves in such cruel karmic deeds.
=C2=A0
thanks,
regards,
k.gopu

N=
amaste,

I have been extremely busy at work for a while now and will contin=
ue to be, working long hours everyday. I just saw a few mails from the vege=
tarianism thread. Just a few quick points.

* * *

Self-identification of h=
uman beings and animals with body and body parts is much much stronger and =
denser than that of plants and trees. Self-identification of plants and tre=
es is very subtle. When a leaf or flower or fruit is plucked or cut off fro=
m a plant or tree, the emotion experienced by it is very subtle. On the oth=
er hand, if a body part is cut off in an animal or a human being, the emoti=
on experienced is much stronger. Even after death, an animal may identify w=
ith the body and think of it as "I".

The kaarmik debt formed by eating the=
 flesh of an animal, which the animal's mind considers as a part of "I" and=
 is highly attached to, is much bigger than the kaarmik debt formed by eati=
ng leaves, vegetables or fruits of a plant or a tree or killing bacteria.

=
As long as we live in a physical body, creation of new kaarmik debts is ine=
vitable. But we strive to minimize the debts we create newly.

* * *

You a=
re what you eat. Our body and various chemicals and hormones in it are form=
ed based on what we eat.

Meat is highly taamasik. Eating meat increases ta=
mas in one. It increases ego and identification with body and makes spiritu=
al progress more difficult. After all, if one is eating flesh of an animal =
that was highly attached to its body, the quality of body attachment will b=
ecome denser in one. This is not conducive to spiritual progress.

* * *

I=
t is possible that a spiritual giant from past ate meat and yet remained fu=
lly saattwik. However, it is not easy to emulate such a person. One wanting=
 to overcome identification with the body and make spiritual progress, is b=
etter off eating saattwik food (simple vegetables, fruits, greens, grains e=
tc with mild spices).

If a meat-eating person stops eating meat and eats c=
ooked vegetables, greens and lentils/dals (for protein) for several months,=
 while trying to read spiritual literature and trying to make spiritual pro=
gress, one will see that it makes a big difference.

* * *

Someone mention=
ed that Vyasa liked fish, Radha cooked deer for Krishna etc. In matters lik=
e this, there is a lot of misguided propaganda in modern India. Assertions =
not backed by specific quotes from classics or scriptures that can be verif=
ied by scholars are best ignored.

Swami Vivekananda and Aurobindo may have=
 given a clarion call to Indians to be more pro-active and energetic. But t=
hat does not require eating meat. It is wrong to attribute to them support =
of meat eating.

Best regards,
Narasimha
