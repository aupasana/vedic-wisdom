Subject: Right deity and sadhana (Re: Yogananda)

Namaste,

Choosing the right deity for sadhana is important. If you do not know the 
right deity, just doing some sadhana is definitely better than waiting. Pick 
whatever deity seems natural to you and do sadhana.

Please remember that sadhana for spiritual progress is different from 
sadhana for specific material benefits. No matter which deity you worship, 
sadhana performed for spiritual progress never goes waste. However, 
sometimes it may be necessary to experience the results of some bad karmas 
before some good things happen. Imagine all your karmas lying in a pile in a 
basket. Suppose some of the really good karmas that will enable you to do 
serious sadhana and experience great things lie at the bottom or middle of 
the pile. When you start sadhana, suppose god decides to give you the fruits 
of those auspicious karmas. Imagine him reaching into the pile and 
retrieving those karmas. In the process, some other karmas may spill over 
and give their fruits. Some of those may be undesirable. So what? They had 
to be experienced sometime or the other, anyway!

A serious sadhaka should never be disheartened by a few seemingly 
undesirable results after starting a spiritual sadhana. Just keep going.

One gentleman I know received mantra for Kaali from a very good 
priest-cum-yogi in late 2005. After he did the mantra for a few days, he was 
laid off and lost his job. He was not perturbed. He continued his sadhana 
and used the break to go on an extended trip to India and make a pilgrimage 
to some nice places. He participated in the Shata Chandi homam we conducted 
at the Kaalikambal temple in Chennai in March 2006. He met my guru and got 
the opportunity to be his room mate for a week when we stayed at the house 
of a priest during the homam. He could observe and interact with my guru 
very closely. Most importantly, when my guru had a vision of the Mother on 
2006 March 3 afternoon, in which She told him to start the work on spreading 
homam in the world, this gentleman was present there. Though he could not 
see the Mother, he actually smelled something out of the world and was 
baffled. He knew something was going on, but did not know what. The temple 
was closed at the time and my guru and this gentlemen were the only people 
on the premises when the Mother appeared. Even though he could not see the 
Mother, it was most fortunate of him to be present there at *that* crucial 
moment. That is enough to mould the rest of his life.

You never know how, when and where the grace of god falls on you. 
Calculations and logic are useless when it comes to the grace of god. Just 
surrender and keep doing whatever sadhana you picked. If it needs 
fine-tuning, somebody will appear to tell you that. Any bad things that 
happen when doing a spiritual sadhana should be viewed as nature settling 
some debts so that you are prepared to receive the fruits of some really 
auspicious karmas.

As Shirdi Sai Baba says, you should have "sraddha and saburi". Have devotion 
and patience. There is no limit to what you can get then.

Best regards,
Narasimha
