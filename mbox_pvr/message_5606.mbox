They say that lakshmi (whichever form..dhana, dhanya etc) is "chanchal" in=
 nature..never could grasp the real meaning of what it means..any comments.=

      Namaste,

 

Only when the raw grains of scriptural guidelines are co=
oked in the water of experience on the fire of wisdom does one get somethin=
g that can be digested. Some misconceptions are there in some sections of o=
rthodox tradition. What you heard is not correct and go ahead with lighting=
 the ghee lamp everyday.

 

Lakshmi, whether in the form of Dhana Lakshmi =
(wealth) or Dhanya lakshmi (grains and food) or Vidya Lakshmi (knowledge), =
should be shared with the world and put to good use. Then only Lakshmi will=
 grow. If one selfishly keeps one's wealth or food or knowledge to oneself =
and keeps it *captive*, Lakshmi will not grow. Instead, Lakshmi will leave =
one then.

 

Never keep Lakshmi that you get captive. Share Her with other=
s and put Her to good use. Then She will be pleased and do good to you.

 
=

The principle you heard is based on a misconception on how to handle Laksh=
mi.

 

Best regards,

Narasimha
