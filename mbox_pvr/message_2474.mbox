Namaste,
 
(1) Namboodiris are (or atleast used to be) adepts in fire worsh=
ip. What this namboodiri did is the correct way.
 
Visualize the external f=
ire as your internal fire and worship it. Then offerings in it will kindle =
your internal fire and streamline it, depending on how strong your identifi=
cation is (it will get stronger with practice). If anyone handles that exte=
rnal fire or makes offerings in it, some karmas will be submitted by that p=
erson to your internal fire for burning. This intermingling of karmas can b=
e allowed for people whose karmas are anyway intertwined, like husband and =
wife or parents and children. Of course, you can also take on karmas from t=
he entire world if you are ready and willing to face their consequences, bu=
t a person with a strong individualized ego should limit the karmas one fac=
es and work on erasing that ego. When one's ego becomes very subtle, it may=
 be possible to take on more karmas and face their consequences. After all,=
 if you start plucking leaves, flowers and fruits from a small plant, it wi=
ll die. If you guard it and let it grow very big, it can give flowers and f=
ruits to many more people. So, until you become very pure, keep working to =
burn your karmas and free yourself from the vaasanas (mental conditioning) =
caused by them.
 
But some people use fire in the same way an idol is used.=
 They allow anyone to start the fire in their homam, handle the fire and ma=
ke offerings in it etc. If one who strongly identifies one's internal fire =
with external fire does such things, it can be disastrous. However, luckily=
, most people who follow this approach do not understand much about fire an=
d do not have a strong identification with the fire. So, fire is practicall=
y like an idol for them and they do not benefit from fire as much as one ca=
n. Thus, allowing everyone to start or handle or making offerings into you =
fire can be inefficient at best and disastrous at worst.
 
The best approac=
h is: You start your own fire. Only you handle it. Only you make offerings =
in it. In your mind, identify it with your own internal fire (bhootaagni) t=
hat burns in the subtle body. If you do this for a while, a strong bond is =
indeed formed. Without your knowledge, the internal fire will become strong=
 and burn various vaasanas.
 
(2) There are different methods for beeja, sh=
akti and keelakam, though anga nyaasa and kara nyaasa are usually standard.=
 Do not worry about these things and do what you are used to or what you ar=
e more attracted to.
 
As I said many times, these nyaasas are just formali=
ty for most people. Placing a letter in a particular body part has a higher=
 significance than just tough a part and saying it. Visualizing a specific =
body part vibrating with a specific sound is possible only after one makes =
sufficient progress in purifying one's subtle perception. So there is no po=
int in discussing what is essentially a formality. I can tell you that this=
 will not block you.
 
(3) They should be shown in the video. If you cannot=
 get them, please feel free to just say it and not show any mudra. It will =
not block you.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
