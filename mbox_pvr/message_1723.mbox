Namaste,

(1) Even if you put the correct amounts, some smoke when the fire goes off 
is unavoidable. Like you said, smoke is negligible when fire burns but there 
is some smoke at the end.

One option is to take the homa kundam outside while the fire is still 
burning and the smoke has not started yet. Another option if you have a 
strong exhaust fan over the stoves in the kitchen is to place the homa 
kundam under the exhaust fan and let the smoke go out. Third option is to 
place the homa kundam close to a window and place a small exhaust fan in the 
window.

(2) Exhaust fan is your best bet. One person I know has a nice setup. He put 
a "clay chiminea" (search for it on google). He put some sand inside it, a 
few bricks on the sand and arranged the copper homa kundam inside it so that 
it is stable and does not move. He made an L-shaped metal tube and connected 
it on the top of the chiminea. The other end of the L goes out the window. 
One side of the chiminea is open and he accesses homa kundam through that 
side. He actually uses a big firewood log and does Chandi homam in that 
setup. The hot smoke goes up in the chiminea and goes out the metal tube. Of 
course, for a homam with a few coconut pieces, such a setup may be 
unnecessary.

(3) It is fine either way. It is good to leave the ashes there and keep 
burning them everyday. However, smoke can be created when previous ashes 
come in contact with fire. So your approach of cleaning it everyday is fine.

(4) Bear the cold. :-) Wear warm clothes.

(5) We used to do that, but I have a custom made 2ft x 2ft x 1ft deep 
firepit (a four side open fireplace) now, with the chimney atop it going up 
2 feet above the top of the house. One partial view of it is there in the 
homam video. The video was recorded next to it. I place my copper homa 
kundam amid bricks in that firepit and do homam with firewood logs and a big 
fire. Ravi also uses firewood. We will see if we can take a picture and send 
you.

I used to put two pieces next to each other with the white side facing up 
and put a small camphor pieces on the ground between them to start fire. The 
edges of the two coconut pieces catch fire. By moving them a little after a 
while, you can make the pieces catch fire on different sides. The idea of 
having two pieces is that one piece can help the other in catching fire in 
different parts. After a while, I used to turn around one piece and turn 
around the other piece after the first piece is brightly burning again. For 
poornahuti, I used to put a third piece. So, the whole Ganapathi homam is 
done with 3 dry cocnut pieces of 1.5"x1.5" and several ghee drops.

(6) Fire is fire. It is good to sit by it. However, if gods have already 
been sent off, it is ok to get away. If you want to take the homa kundam 
outside or under a kitchen exhaust, that is fine after you finish the 
ritual.

But do not extinguish the fire forcefully (by pouring water or something). 
Even if there is no god in fire, fire is fire. It should be allowed to burn 
as long as it wants to. If you do with dry cococut pieces, it will go away a 
few minutes after you stop putting ghee anyway.

Best regards,
Narasimha
