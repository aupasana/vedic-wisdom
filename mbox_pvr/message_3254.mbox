Namaste Sri Narasimha,

For example, when one=
's wife or husband (or someone close) yells at one or abuses one, fairly or=

 previous actions and focus the mind on what good actions can be performed =

=A0
This has been a recurrent =
theme in the Indian spiritual domain. 
When something happens to an "Indivi=
dual" - take it as a karma, accept it and move on. 
But when something happ=
ens to "State" - Don't accept it but protect it. 
=A0
I shall try to illust=
rate this using examples: 
a) When pandavas are given Khandavprastha, lord =
Krishna has told pandavas to accept it as karama boomi (accept) but when In=
draprastha has been snatched away by deceit, Krishna has asked pandavas to =
fight for it as their duty. (fight)
=A0
b) Gandhiji's satyagraha principle:=
 
When an adversary tries to cause harm to you, submit yourself to the crue=
lity but don't bow down on your principles (accept)
When a neighbor puts yo=
u incharge of his household and when others try to cause harm to that house=
hold, protect it even if you had to forsake your life for it. (fight)

c) W=
hen cancer affected Ramakrishna, he accepted it and moved on with it. 
But =
when the cancer affected society, Lord Krishna fought and eliminated the ca=
ncerous growth in the society. 
=A0

Why can't we apply the similar argumen=
t to domestic problem?
e.g, when abuses are thrown at one, why not fight an=
d bring it to logical conclusion as it's causing a conflict in the domestic=
 harmony and hence suffering to children and neighbors at large? Why just a=
ccept it?
=A0
When cancer is affecting bodily function, why not eliminate c=
ancerous growth, prolong the life and hence fulfil rinas rather than bodily=
 suffer and hence unable to fulfil karmas?
=A0
Applying one rule to Self an=
d other rule to the society, is a bit confusing. 
=A0
Can you please clarif=
y this doubt?

Namaste,

I am replying to the list without re=
vealing your identity.

When you are doing an action (e.g. a homam, an arch=
ana, a service to the poor in your area etc), it is very unlikely and diffi=
cult that you are doing it without an "I" sense. But it is ok. Atleast, you=
 are engaging your I-sense to work for the benefit of the world rather than=
 self-gratification. When do a homam or archana, you are trying to please a=
 deity (personification of a particular good quality in all the people of t=
he world). When you do social service, you are helping needy people. And so=
 on.

While doing various kinds of sadhana, one tries to take the focus of =
mind from the limited self (body, name, status, image etc) and expand it to=
 a larger entity (e.g. a deity, a community, a society, a country, universe=
 etc). One tries to focus the mind on others and not think much about onese=
lf. This helps one overcome mind's natural tendency to focus on limited sel=
f and gratification of that limited self.

While doing that, however, thoug=
hts may arise "I am doing this good and important work". Such thoughts brin=
g the focus of mind back to the limited self (body, name, status, image etc=
). By telling oneself that the Lord is doing it though one and that one is =
merely an instrument, i.e. by cultivating the spirit of "Sarvam Sri Krishna=
arpanamastu", one tries to overcome that tendency towards self-gratificatio=
n and/or self-glorification.

After repeated practice, such thinking become=
s common sense to one and one's mind gets focused on doing what one sees as=
 one's dharma, without any sense of pride or self-gratification or self-glo=
rification.

*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *

If a priest doing an arch=
ana for you takes your name and nakshatra in the sankalpam before the pooja=
, there is nothing to be worried. In your mind, try to think as above.

Som=
e priests go much further and say all kinds of highly specific things in sa=
nkalpa. For example, I have seen priests say "to give dharma, artha, kaama,=
 moksha, well-being, strength, boldness, success, fearless, longevity, heal=
th, wealth etc to so and so person, to remove all past, present and future =
sins and all past, present and future problems related to all planets, shad=
owy planets, sub-planets in rasi, navamsa, drekkana, trimsamsa etc charts a=
t birth, in dasas and in transits, and to give results as though all planet=
s are placed in the 11th house and not in the actual house of placement" et=
c etc. Some priests spend 5-10 minutes mentioning so many specific desires =
in sankalpam. When you find a priest saying things like that, I suggest jus=
t taking it easy and not getting either excited or disturbed. Just think in=
 your mind "I am doing this ritual as a humble offering to you. Please rece=
ive it kindly and give whatever you see as appropriate" and try
 to focus t=
he mind on the deity. What's in your heart is far more important than anyth=
ing else.

*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *

Cultivating the sense that =
whatever good work you are doing is being done by the Lord *through you* an=
d whatever results (including very bad ones) are given to you are fruits gr=
anted by the Lord to your karmas which you should accept without regrets, i=
s an important activity that should go on outside of the ritual time.

For =
example, when one's wife or husband (or someone close) yells at one or abus=
es one, fairly or unfairly, one has a choice. One can either become upset a=
nd angry and remain in that mood for a few hours wondering why the other pe=
rson is so unfair/wrong, or one can just accept it as the fruits given by t=
he Lord for one's previous actions and focus the mind on what good actions =
can be performed *now*. Similarly, when people praise one, one has a choice=
. One can either become excited and gloat in the praises or one can think t=
hat the Lord used one as an instrument in getting that work done and focus =
the mind on what good actions can be performed *now*.

Best regards,
Narasi=
