Sri Narasimha garu,

=C2=A0
To add to the list,
=C2=A0
Why a gender bias f=

 spiritual path..cannot we perform upanayanam for=C2=A0all genders?

Dear Narasimha,
=C2=A0
I =
have two queries.
=C2=A0
1) Why is only the Gayatri mantra transmitted duri=
ng an upanayanam ceremony? I mean, different people can have rnas with diff=
erent divine beings/deities etc, and only a sad-guru can surely know which =
deity would be the most suited for an individual's spiritual progress. Like=
 Ramakrishna Paramhamsa was a Brahman by birth=C2=A0but he did sadhana of M=
a Kaali.=C2=A0Worshipping Mahaganapati can remove obstacles from a person's=
 path. Therefore, instead of the Gayatri mantra why cannot one=C2=A0initate=
=C2=A0the child in worshipping Mahaganapati mula mantra, which is apt for a=
nyone to chant?=C2=A0=C2=A0This is merely a product of tradition or is ther=
e some solid spiritual basis for this. (only Gayatri mantra trasmission) .
=
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
2) When a family member expires, we maintain a period of 13 d=
ays of various rituals etc and during that period no worship is generally a=
llowed inside the household (possibly as a mark of mourning). Is there any =
harm if a person does carry on with his regular worship/puja/ japa/homa dur=
ing this period of mourning? 
=C2=A0
-Regards

Namaste,

Priests offer samidhas (twigs) symbolizin=
g different samskaras. There is nothing wrong in offering dry coconut piece=
s instead.

The most important part of upanayanam is the brahmopadesa, i.e.=
 teaching of the Gayatri mantra. All other things are secondary. For exampl=
e, many priests re-enact all the rituals that were supposed to be done sinc=
e birth (e.g. naming, first feeding, first shaving etc), just in case those=
 samskaras were skipped earlier. One can wonder if that is really necessary=
 and whether it has any real impact on one's spiritual evolution.

There is=
 also a lot of fake drama enacted. The young person and his father repeat t=
hings in Sanskrit that are told by the priest. Those who know Sanskrit will=
 see that the young man says he is going to go to Kashi and learn Veda etc.=
 He says he will live by begging alms from now on. He even practices it by =
asking all attendees for alms. There is a lot of entertaining drama. Of cou=
rse, most boys getting upanayanam do not really intend to leave parents, go=
 to Kashi to learn Veda and do not really plan to live by begging! A lot of=
 things they say are simply lies, done just for fun and to enact a drama ba=
sed on how things could have been in old days!

* * *

Put bluntly, being g=
iven a mantra by a guru is essentially a spiritual event and not a social e=
vent or a party, though upanayanam has transformed from a spiritual event i=
nto a social event. All you really need is the young man and his guru sitti=
ng in one place and the mantra being taught. You don't need a big crowd.

O=
f course, one may say that a big crowd is needed to come and give blessings=
, but "blessings" are a misunderstood and overrated concept. For someone to=
 give you blessings that do some good to you, the person should have someth=
ing in his karmik account and the ability to transfer it to you. Most of th=
e times, blessings given by people in our society are a mere formality and =
mean nothing, like checks that have "void - this is not a real check" print=
ed on them.

Instead of hundred people with various levels of interest in t=
he goings on visiting the function out of social compulsion and watching po=
ssibly with boredom, an ideal setup for an upanayanam is just the sishya an=
d guru and some sadhakas related to them who have done sadhana and wish the=
 young man well.

* * *

If you ask me, the most important thing is this. T=
he person who is transmitting the Gayatri mantra (usually father) should in=
tensify his spiritual sadhana, especially with Gayatri mantra, in the month=
s before upanayanam. If possible, keep brahmacharya for a few months and ch=
ant Gayatri mantra for an hour or two everyday. During that time, he should=
 never say Gayatri mantra out loud.

When he transmits the mantra, he shoul=
d ensure that only the young man hears it and nobody else does (i.e. no dil=
ution in the transmitted energy). The custom is to say it in the ear while =
a cloth covers both, but that only *symbolizes* secretiveness and may not r=
eally *ensure* secretiveness. If everybody (especially the priest) is sitti=
ng close to them, they may also hear it in spite of a the cloth covering th=
em.

When I did upanayanam to my son, we did the rituals in open air in our=
 back yard. At the time of brahmopadesa muhurta, I took my son inside the p=
ooja room where I did my sadhana. I did not allow anybody, including the pr=
iests, to come there. I taught the mantra to my son in an low, but audible,=
 voice. I repeated a few times, made him repeat it a few times, ensured his=
 pronunciation was correct, and then both of us did a maalaa (108 times med=
itation) with it silently. We then came back to the backyard and the ritual=
s continued.

One more thing on muhurta: If you got a muhurta from an astro=
loger you trust and want to follow it, please ensure that Gayatri mantra is=
 taught at that muhurta. THAT is the main event. Some priests put a paste m=
ade of cumin seeds and jaggery on the young man's head at the muhurta time.=
 That is irrelevant and brahmopadesa is the main thing.

* * *

Though we d=
id a detailed ritual for my son's upanayanam, my own upanayanam was a very =
simple affair. Though my father is an orthodox braahmana following a very s=
imple and austere lifestyle, he is unorthodox in the matter of rituals. Abo=
ve all, he fearlessly follows his convictions and does not engage in ritual=
s that he does not consider meaningful. He is also against following the le=
tter of the rules and breaking the spirit. For example, when he went to a g=
riha pravesh (housewarming) ceremony once, they were beating a cow to force=
 it to climb stairs to enter the room. People bring a cow into the room at =
the time of housewarming, as they consider a cow to symbolize Lakshmi and s=
ome steps in the ritual require a cow in the room. As the cow was not happy=
 to climb stairs, they resorted to violence to force it. My father was sad =
to see the suffering of the cow and told them bluntly that they were doing =
adharma and there was no point in getting a cow in the
 room like that. But=
 my father puts more value on the spirit of the rules rather than the lette=
r and does not hesitate to speak his mind in front of anybody.

For my upan=
ayanam, he took me to Lord Venkateswara temple in Tirupati/Tirumala, which =
is his favorite temple. At the time of muhurta, we were on the hill near th=
e temple. He spent a few hours doing his japam with various stotras and I a=
lso did japam with several stotras. When the muhurta came, he simply taught=
 me Gayatri mantra and that was it. No rituals of any kind were performed, =
except for japam for a few hours.

In my opinion, such a simple approach is=
 also perfectly fine. The key points are that the person giving mantra shou=
ld have done some sadhana, both of them should be in a good and relaxed moo=
d at the time and environment should be peaceful, and, the person receiving=
 mantra should do a lot of sadhana with it later on.

If a businessman open=
s an account in his son's name for a new business venture by the young man,=
 what matters is how much money father gave and how well the son used the m=
oney, how he ran the new business and how he grew the money. How big a part=
y was held, how many people came and what activities they engaged in is irr=
elevant in the long run.

* * *

My purpose is not to discourage elaborate =
rituals. Do them if there is social pressure to do so or you find them inte=
resting. But, atleast ensure that mantropadesa happens peacefully and corre=
ctly. More importantly, ensure that the young man does some sadhana with Ga=
yatri mantra everyday, after upanayanam.

Also, it is perfectly acceptable =
(and beneficial) to initiate the young person into homam after upanayanam i=
s done. On the same day or a few days later, one can teach a simple version=
 of Ganapathi homam and let the young person perform it by oneself during w=
eekends or so. One can start off with the super-short procedure and slowly =
add things. Doing Gayatri mantra everyday and homam now and then will accel=
erate the spiritual evolution of the young person.

Narasimha=
