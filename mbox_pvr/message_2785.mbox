Namaste,
 
Now please stop responding to Nitish Arya. As much as I hate to =
moderate this group, I had no choice but to ban him from the group after he=
 continued to misbehave even after being warned to focus on the subject mat=
ter and not get personal with anyone.
 
Please put this issue to death and =
do not discuss this any further. Please go back to the subject matter.
 
As=
 I said before, we can expect such disturbances now and then as more and mo=
re people start coming. I urge members not to be perturbed by new members w=
ith an attitude problem, ignore them as best as they can and stick to the s=
ubject matter and continue their activities as usual.
 
Best regards,
Naras=
imha
