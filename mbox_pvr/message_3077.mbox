Namaste Jitender,

(1) You choose a form that represents certain things to your mind and start 
imagining that form in fire whenever you do homam. If you do not have any 
idea, I may suggest the supreme cosmic being form of Mahaganapathi. Forget 
trunk, tusks etc. Imagine a man with 1000 heads, 1000 hands and 1000 legs, 
in whom the entire creation exists. Imagine a man who eats whenever and 
whatever each person in this world eats. Imagine a man who drinks whenever 
and whatever each person in this world drinks. Imagine a man who talks 
whenever and whatever each person in this world talks. Imagine a man who 
desires whenever and whatever each person in this world desires. Imagine a 
man who does whenever and whatever each person in this world does. Imagine a 
man who knows whenever and whatever each person in this world knows.

Imagine that a supreme being comes into the fire and accepts your offerings 
through fire. Try to surrender to that being and remove your mind's focus on 
*impermanent* things such as body, name, fame etc.

(2) Sthoola sareera is the gross physical body with bones, muscles, nerves, 
blood etc and covered by skin. Sookshma sareera or subtle body is the 
essence inside that you cannot perceive with eyes, ears, nose etc. It 
contains the life force and supports its movement. It contains various nadis 
(channels in which life force and self-awareness flow) and chakras (realms 
of self-awareness). Life force and self-awareness flow in it. Kaarana 
sareera or causal body is the sum total of one's karmas, i.e. all the 
conditioning accumulated in chitta over many lives.

> then how is this experience different from hallucination

(3) Fantastic question! First, please read the following post:

Internal god and external god
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/2498

Suppose one is trying to see Sun and unable to see Sun directly. Suppose one 
is seeing Sun's reflection in a mirror. Sun is the so-called "external" god. 
Mirror is your self-awareness or ego. As long as your ego exists, you will 
only see an "internal" reflection of "external" god. Coloring and dirt on 
the mirror may make Sun look duller and different. Similarly, conditioning 
of the mind and impurities in self-awareness may make one visualize god 
differently.

One sees a brighter Sun in the mirror as it is cleaned. Similarly, one's 
perception of god becomes better as one's mental conditioning reduces and 
self-awareness gets purified.

Now, it is possible that one does not clean the mirror and simply paints a 
bright Sun on the dirty mirror. Similarly, one can just hallucinate various 
mystical experiences. That is certainly possible. However, a bright Sun 
painted on a dirty mirror does not give light and the mirror remains dirty. 
Similarly, one hallucinating deities or other experiences will remain with a 
lot of mental conditioning. One's ego will remain, one's fears, anxieties, 
pride, attractions, aversions etc will all remain. On the other hand, one 
with a cleaner mirror really reflecting Sun better will see everything with 
more brightness. Similarly, one with a real experience of god will becomes 
clearer in one's vision of what is impermanent and what is permanent and 
make progress towards overcoming fears, anxieties, pride, attractions, 
aversions etc.

In both the cases, what one sees is within the mirror. Similarly, what one 
experiences is within the mind. But, in one case (hallucination), the focus 
is on the experience and the underlying weaknesses and root problems (dirt 
and color of the mirror) are not fixed. In the other case (real experience), 
the focus is on fixing the underlying the weaknesses and root problems and 
experience happens as a result.

As you engage in the rituals, visualize god to the best of your ability and 
try to surrender to the best of your ability. Slowly, as the dirt cleans up, 
Sun will shine bright through the mirror and shed light everywhere. 
Eventually, if you are destined, the mirror (ego) may disappear and you may 
directly see Sun, without any limiting mirror (ego).

The key point is to clean up the egoistic impulses and other conditioning in 
the mind while trying to visualize god. Holding a clean mirror or magnifying 
glass close to the dirty mirror may reflect Sun's rays onto it and they may 
clean up some dirt. Similarly, spending some time close to homam fire may 
reflect god's light onto one's limited self and clean up some conditioning.

Best regards,
Narasimha
