Dear Krishna Kanth,
 
Super-short tarpana is good enough.
 
Though traditio=
nally homam is done after japam and tarpana, I strongly recommend making ho=
mam the first activity and then doing japam and tarpana. That is more appro=
priate for the times we live in.
 
People of old times had brightly burning=
 bhootaagni inside. Their performance of a daily fire ritual was just a res=
ponsibility towards the universe. They were doing fire ritual for maintaini=
ng dharma in the universe and not necessarily for saving their own bhootaag=
ni from being extinguished.
 
Most people today - even those who are re-inc=
arnations of very good yogis from the last life - are initially lacking in =
internal purity and their bhootaagni is very very very weak and actually pr=
etty much extinguished in most people. The times are such, the culture is s=
uch, our lifestyles are such, the influences on our minds are such and the =
energy filling the air we breath is such. Thus, one's reason for doing a ho=
mam is different from the old times. When one does a fire ritual, one does =
one's dharma towards the universe and, at the same time, improves one's own=
 internal bhootaagni a little bit.
 
For doing any spiritual activity - jap=
am or tarpana or just reading a scripture or contemplation - strong bhootaa=
gni is very important for internalizing and digesting the experience spirit=
ually. If a person with a very weak or extinguished bhootaagni does such sp=
iritual activities, the impact is negligible. As a person's bhootaagni is m=
aximized immediately following a ritual with an external fire, it helps one=
 do a better job with other spiritual activities.
 
Thus, my recommendation=
 is the same as Narayan's. Do homam, meditate as the poornaahuti burns and =
then do tarpana. In fact, if you are only doing deva and rishi tarpanas, yo=
u can even integrate it with homam. You can do deva and rishi tarpanas whil=
e sitting in front of the fire, after the uttaraangam and before the poorna=
ahuti, and then go on to offer poornaahuti. However, if you also want to in=
clude pitris (deceased ancestors) along with devas and rishis, I suggest do=
ing it separately after the homam.
 
*        *        *
 
I want to narrat=
e an incident related to tarpana manuals.
 
Manish thinks very highly of ta=
rpana and asked me to create a manual for it last year. In the case of homa=
m, I studied and practiced several approaches and experienced some things i=
nternally and knew what I was talking about, before the homam manuals were =
created. In case of tarpana, my experience and internal understanding was l=
imited when I created the manuals. Though I had Manish's blessings, I had s=
ome doubts on whether what I consolidated (as 3 options) was good enough or=
 not. On the day chosen for making the manuals available, I did my Chandi h=
omam in the morning and prayed to the 18-handed Mahalakshmi/Durga idol I us=
e for homam, "O Mother, I was very comfortable with homam manuals, but my e=
xperience in tarpana is limited. But Manish asked me to create and distribu=
te tarpana manuals. Several important people may be using these manuals in =
future. If what I consolidated is good and you approve it, please give me s=
ome signal today as I perform the procedure. I will understand. I will publ=
ish them only if you give your approval."
 
Then I sat down to perform tarp=
anas. The moment I invoked gods and rishis into the kalasha, there was such=
 a powerful wind outside (the windows were open). The sound of the wind was=
 really loud. I started deva tarpana and said "brahmaa tripyataam" and left=
 water. Then I took water into my palm again and said "vishnuh tripyataam".=
 As soon as I left that water, I heard big thup-thup sounds from outside. W=
hen I lifted my head to see through the window, I saw that heavy rain with =
really big drops had just started. It did not rain in the previous 10 days =
and there were no noticeable clouds in the sky that morning. It was very su=
nny and bright until then. But a heavy rain started as soon as tarpana star=
ted and the rain continued till the end of the day.
 
I took the wind and t=
he rain as signals of approval from the Mother, thanked her at the end and =
went ahead to publish the manuals. As I performed the ritual more times lat=
er, I slowly understood the real meaning and purpose of tarpana. For many p=
eople with weak minds that are afflicted by rinas to deceased ancestors wit=
h mental weaknesses, tarpana is a very very useful ritual. I now fully unde=
rstand why Manish, or Vimalananda for that matter, emphasized performing bo=
th homam and tarpana and how they supplement each other. I am glad that mor=
e people are considering performing a quick homam and a quick tarpana on a =
regular basis. Even a combination of a 30-minute homam and a 5-minute tarpa=
na performed daily will go a long way in freeing one.
 
Best regards,
Naras=
imha

  Subject: [vedic-wis=
dom] Query regarding Homam / Tarpanam

        Sri Narasimha Garu,

       =
 Namaskaram.

        If one has to do both Homam and Tarpanam daily, what =
would be your suggestion in terms of which would be the order one has to pe=
rform both.. is it that first do homam and then Tarpanam or vice versa or i=
t does  not matter?

        I have downloaded the all tarpana manuals from=
 the website and thinking to start off with super short process from the co=
ming poornima day. As i already do the regular Homam which consumes 45 mins=
 in the morning, just wanted to keep it simple for tarpana, please me you g=
uidance what should be the order.

        Thanks
        KK
