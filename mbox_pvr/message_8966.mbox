Namaste Digamber ji,
=C2=A0
(1) For samputikarana with beejas (syllable com=
binations), we repeat it before and after each verse, but in reverse order =
at the end.
=C2=A0
Suppose we are doing samputikarana with OM aiM. Then it =
will be
=C2=A0
OM aiM <verse1> aiM OM
OM aiM <verse2> aiM OM
OM aiM <verse3=
> aiM OM
and so on.
=C2=A0
For samputikarana with a short mantra also, we r=
epeat it before and after each verse.
=C2=A0
Suppose we are doing samputika=
rana with "OM duM durgAyai namaH". Then it will be
=C2=A0
OM duM durgAyai n=
amaH <verse1> OM duM durgAyai namaH
OM duM durgAyai namaH <verse2> OM duM d=
urgAyai namaH
OM duM durgAyai namaH <verse3> OM duM durgAyai namaH
and so o=
n.
=C2=A0
But, for samputikarana with a verse, one convention is to say the=
 verse only once between verse. Suppose you are doing samputikarana with <S=
Verse>. Then it will be
=C2=A0
<SVerse><verse1><SVerse><verse2><SVerse><ver=
se3><SVerse>....<SVerse><verseLast><SVerse>
=C2=A0
This makes it shorter, i=
.e. 700+700+1=3D1401. It is of course possible to do the way you mentioned =
below also, i.e. 2100 times.
=C2=A0
(2) Good observation! I noted the same =
long back, i.e. the 24 deities found in one AvaraNa in saptashatI yantra (a=
nd among parivAra devatAH) are all found in those "namastasyai namastasyai"=
 verses in the 5th chapter in the same order, except that dhR^iti and puShT=
i are missing. I added two verses to Saptashati - one for dhR^iti (after la=
kShmI verse) and one for puShTi (after tuShTi verse). If others want to do =
the same, the text is in the following format:
=C2=A0
yA devI sarva bhUteSh=
u <name> rUpeNa saMsthitA. namastasyai namastasyai namastasyai namonamaH..
=
=C2=A0
Place dhR^iti and puShTi in the place of <name>. Add the two verses =
after the verses for lakShmI and tuShTi (respectively).
=C2=A0
Some people =
may wonder that this will add 2 to the count of 700. I think the current sa=
ptashati counting is anyway messed up and we arrive at 700 in a laborious m=
anner. Moreover, there are different versions. So I am not bothered about t=
he exact count. It is tough to know for sure what the exact original text w=
as. It may be a combination of several options available today. But definit=
ely it should include the above two verses.
=C2=A0
I have been reading Sapt=
ashati this way for many years now and told a few people I met physically a=
nd chanted with, but perhaps failed to mention it online. I am glad you ask=
ed!
=C2=A0
(3) I am cc'ing to him. If he wants, he can reply.
=C2=A0
But pl=
ease remember that different bodies have different needs. The food and wate=
r schedule that worked for him may not work for you. You need to find somet=
hing that works for you. Basic guidelines would be:
=C2=A0
(A) Don't do hom=
am (or meditation) on a heavy stomach. Either (i) eat very lightly and cont=
inue, or (ii) eat moderately, stop for an hour and continue then, or (iii) =
eat heavily and stop for 2-3 hours. Basically, you should not feel heavy wh=
en in homam or japam.
=C2=A0
(B) At the same time, starving yourself when y=
ou are still aware of body and attached to it, is also unproductive. If you=
 do homam for 5-6 hours and feel really hungry and weak, it is not a great =
idea to continue. It will be better to eat a light quantity and continue, p=
erhaps after a small gap.
=C2=A0
(C) Apart from how much you eat, what you =
eat is important. If you want to do serious sadhana, eat saattwik food. Don=
't use too much oil, don't eat meat or eggs, don't eat heavy or pungent spi=
ces, don't eat fried food, don't eat tamasik things like onion and garlic e=
tc. Eat simple steamed vegetables with rice, chappati etc and may be a litt=
le ghee or oil. Milk and fruits are also a great idea, though you should no=
t eat most fruits with milk (they are a bad combination that will spoil you=
r digestion). You can drink milk one time and eat some fruits another time,=
 etc.
=C2=A0
(D) I did homam for entire day a few times. I also did homam f=
or half of the day and japam for the rest of the day. I found the latter to=
 be more effective. But others may feel differently.
=C2=A0
If one indeed g=
ets a chance to spend most of awake time in homam/japam (or even just chant=
ing some prayer) for 3-5 days, that will be awesome. For one who may be rea=
dy, such sadhana can trigger the next stage in one's ongoing transformation=
. I know someone from here, who started spending 12 hours everyday in a com=
bination of homam, japam and reading prayers, and he indeed started the nex=
t stage in his ongoing transformation within a few days of that sadhana. Of=
 course, we are all different and have different strengths, weaknesses, bag=
gages and conditioning..
=C2=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

Dear Narasim=
ha Ji and other members. 
I have been following this forum for some time no=
w and joined this week so that I can take part and get help with questions =
I have from time to time.=C2=A0 Hope members of the forum would be helpful =
and share their views. Here are few questions I have with Chandi path/homam=
 
(1) I read in Vedavani Saptashati book about Pallav, Yojana and Samputa C=
handi path. For Samputa patha, they mention to chant a verse before and aft=
er of each verse, so we have 700(700)700  2100 total verse to chant. Did I =
get it right here? any other opinion? 
(2) In the parivar devata aahuti and=
 Saptashati mahayantra (6th circle), we have 24 devatas [Vishnumaya=C2=85=
=C2=85.Chiti], however, the=C2=A0 5th chapter of Saptashati,=C2=A0 Dhruti a=
nd Pushti are missing, wonder why. I tend to include them when I do stuthi =
mantra alone in the same order as in 6th circle of mahayantra. 
(3) Narasim=
ha Ji, I read that Swami Sathasivom did 1,000 Chandi homas during a 3-month=
 period. I was curious to know how was his day to day conduct. Not that I c=
an think of 100day at stretch but could help for 3 or 5 days. What I would =
like to know, what and how much he ate during this period, at what times of=
 day, how much water one can drink. Was he sitting whole day at stretch for=
 10 homams or did 5+5 homam morning evening? Any detailed info I guess woul=
d be helpful for all here. 
Thanking you, 
Digamber
