e: [vedic-wisdom] Regarding Maha Ganapati Homam


  Namasthe,

   Firstly T=
hanks to Narayan Sir and Narasimha Sir for answering the questions and sorr=
y for the delayed response (been consulting and taking permission of elders=
). My primary motivation in doing Homam is the good feeling that some of my=
 time is well spent, and I dont have any goals as such. Is that a good atti=
tude while doing Homam?. Also I dont have sacred thread, Narsimha Sir, can =
I think of you as my Guru and perform Homam?
   
   Thanks
   Phani

    Namaste Phani,


    > 1)C=
an Homam be performed on the roof top of a house(3-floors)? Can a homam
   =
 > kundam made by arranging red bricks, with sand base be used instead of a=

    > copper one?


    Yes, you can do it on a rooftop. Doing it in the o=
pen is actually better than doing it in closed space. But realize that a ra=
in can cause problems. Keep an umbrella around to protect the fire if it ra=
ins while you are doing homam. It is not good if fire is extinguished by ra=
in in the middle of a homam.

    Yes, you can construct a homa kundam with=
 bricks and sand at the bottom. Use a square shaped huma kunda.


    > 2)W=
hile performing the Homam using the mp3 audio file, should one repeat the
 =
   > mantras mentally along with the audio?


    One can repeat mentally w=
hile listening attentively (not casually). Actually, even listening to mant=
ras with all the attention focused is as powerful as saying mantras.

    S=
uppose person X is chanting a mantra and thinking of some mundane matter in=
 the mind. Suppose person Y is listening to it with focus and thinking of t=
he mantra and its deity. Then the mantra may do nothing for person X and ye=
t person Y may benefit from the mantra. The word mantra means "one that pro=
tects the mind". One can say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be protecte=
d. The key is control over the mind and keeping the mind focused on the man=
tra.

    However, there is a difference between meditation and homam. Mant=
ra is submitted in the internal fire in meditation and it is submitted in t=
he external fire as well in a homam. So making some external sound (even if=
 feeble) is a good idea as opposed to silent chanting or just listening. Tr=
y to repeat slowly.


    > 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Oth=
er conditions/niyamas that
    > should be followed apart from having veget=
erain food?


    Yes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread ceremony) ha=
s been performed can do it. Bachelor or married is irrelevant.

    One sho=
uld follow the yamas and niyamas set by one's guru. Whatever rules one's gu=
ru sets, one should follow them strictly. At the minimum, one should eat on=
ly vegetarian food on the day of homam and take a bath before homam. Anothe=
r rule I will recommend is to avoid eating any solid food 2 hours before ho=
mam.

    By the way, if one without a sacred thread wants to do homam for =
spiritual progress, I am willing to take responsibility and allow them to d=
o it. Such a person can think of me or my guru as guru and perform homam. I=
 am willing to take on any karma incurred in the process until the person c=
rosses some minimum threshhold of purity through homam and other spiritual =
practices. Sacred thread or no sacred thread, mantropadesa or no mantropade=
sa, it does not matter after a while, when the person crosses a threshhold =
of purity. The goal of upanayanam and other mantropadesa by guru is to spee=
d this up and make the person cross the threshhold of purity.

    As long =
as one desires no specific material benefits (and ready to receive whatever=
 god gives) and does homam for spiritual progress, I am willing to help, ev=
en if it means some suffering for me.


    > 4)Any good date to start the =
Homam? or any day would be fine?


    For Mahaganapathi homam, the best is=
 a Chaturthi morning. But any day is fine really.

    *        *        *
=

    Mentioning rain and rooftop homam reminded me of my India trip.

    W=
hen I went to India in May 2008, I and my guru Manish traveled together to =
several places (on a specific project). We ended up doing homam in the morn=
ing in several places (wherever we were). Before the trip, my guru told me =
to carry an umbrella with me. As monsoons come only in June/July in India, =
I did not take it seriously. We were in New Delhi in mid-May. We proceeded =
to the rooftop of the apartment complex we were in, to do a homam. Manish t=
old me, "Narasimha, it is going to rain heavily in this city after our homa=
m finishes". I just smiled.

    To my surprise, it did rain as soon as our=
 homas finished. After we offered poornaahuti, it suddenly started raining =
with really big drops. Luckily, there was a small towel/blanket on the roof=
top close to us. Together, we held it on top of the two small homa kundas, =
closed our eyes and meditated. We held the cloth cover on the homa kundas u=
ntil fire in the two homa kundas went off and then packed everything and we=
nt down. We left for Kurukshetra later that day, but we were told that a he=
avy rain continued for a few days in New Delhi. In fact, rain followed us o=
n that trip as we covered the north, east and west of India. It rained in e=
very place we went to, as we finished our task in that place and prepared t=
o move on.

    Best regards,
    Narasimha
