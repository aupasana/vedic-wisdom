Namaste,
 
Rules are meant for maximizing the effectiveness of a ritual, but not for stopping it altogether. If it is possible to do in the same place everyday, it is better. But, if you are anyway travelling, it is better to do where you are, instead of leaving it completely.
 
When I and Manish were travelling in India when making the documentary "Krishna: History or Myth", we did homam in several towns - in hotels, at houses and on the roadside.
 
My suggestion is to do it at your mother's place, if your mother has no problem with it. It should be good for your mother's place too.
 
That height is fine. The key is that the base of homa kundam should be higher than the base of your body (the only exception to this is a homa kundam dug inside the earth). So make sure that the seat in the chair is slightly lower than the height of the table. Then homa kundam will be higher.
 
Habits coming from birth and arising due to strong conditioning are indeed tough to let go. Just keep trying. Rome is not built in a day!!
 
One useful technique some people use it to take god's name when one is angry and repeat it several times (e.g. "Raama Raama Raama Raama"). Even if angry thoughts are in the mind, let them be there and start saying god's name. After a few repetitions, slowly the focus of the mind may shift from the angry thoughts to god's name and one may calm down before saying abusive words. Give it a try.
 
BTW, there is no need to call me Sir. I am just Narasimha or PVR.
 
Jupiter entered Meena, the sign of rishis, Vedic knowledge and liberation, yesterday late evening. The next few months are a good time for spiritual sadhana and progress.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
