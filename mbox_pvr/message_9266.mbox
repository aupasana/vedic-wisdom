Namaste Rajarshi,
=A0
Very nice to hear from you!
=A0
The "unmistakeable" l=
ink to the *physical* evolution of life on earth does not imply an increasi=
ng sequence of *spiritual* perfection, as you cannot directly map the physi=
cal to the spiritual. More importantly, if your understanding is correct, w=
hy isn't perfection occurring in the FINAL incarnation but occurring well b=
efore?
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
First, regar=
ding Krishna being a "poornavatara", SrimadBhagavatam (SB) does not say tha=
t Rama is not one. In fact, Parasara, father of Vyasa, explicitly mentioned=
 that Rama, Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha are "poornavataras"
 (used that e=
xact expression) while other avataras have some amount of jivatmamsa too (t=
hough paramatmamsa dominates jivatmamsa).
=A0
Secondly, after describing th=
e avataras, SB says that there are in fact innumerable avataras and that al=
l rishis, munis, manus, demigods etc are avataras of Supreme Lord. It is un=
der THAT context that 1.3.28 then proceeds to say "these avataras are parti=
al, while Krishna is Lord Himself." I question if the deduction that Krishn=
a *alone* is Lord Himself and Rama is not is accurate! It only seems to say=
 that all these rishis, manus, demigods etc are partial. As I said above, P=
ararsara explicitly said that both Rama and Krishna are poornavataras.
=A0
=
Third, let us ask a very fundamental question: What exactly does it mean if=
 an avatara is "Lord Himself"?
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0 *
=A0
While SB talks of Krishna being "Lord Himself" in 1.3.28, it a=
lso says in 1.3.30: "forms of Supreme Lord, who is in
 reality formless (ar=
Upa) and of the nature of pure consciousness (chidAtman), are manufactured =
by the qualities of Maya". In the next verse, it further compares forms of =
Lord to clouds in sky and dirt in air. Just as sky *contains* clouds and is=
 beyond them, similarly Lord *contains* forms and is beyond them. So, again=
, what is the meaning of a specific form that descended on earth being "Lor=
d Himself"? I am afraid people may be misinterpreting this notion based on =
their fancies and conditioning..
=A0
All beings are made up of paramatma (s=
upreme/absolute being) and jivatma (living/relative being). The latter port=
ion is dominant in us and is responsible for desires and rebirth. Great ava=
taras descend from a higher portion of paramatma. Very rarely avataras desc=
end entirely from paramatma without ANY jivatma portion. Rama and Krishna a=
re specific examples given by Parasara.
=A0
They are entirely divine, but t=
hey do not encapsulate the entire divinity!!!! After all,
 "entire divinity=
" cannot be encapsulated by any form just as no cloud can contain the entir=
e sky. They take part in the drama obeying and executing the divine will bu=
t NOT altering it. This applies to Krishna as well as Rama.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=

e in this world. But I do not

 an end in a void.
=A0
First, he IS mentioned in SB list of avataras as wel=
l as Parasara's list. If he does not "fit" in your "scheme of evolutionary =
Avatars", then your concept is possibly wrong and avataras are perhaps not =
"evolutionary" as you theorize.
=A0
Secondly, as per Parasara,
 Buddha corr=
esponds to Mercury, who personifies logical mind and the spirit of investig=
ation and comprehension. Logical mind and its spirit of comprehension are i=
nherently fallible. Even a perfected spirit of comprehension is not capable=
 of grasping the Absolute Reality completely, for it is beyond comprehensio=
n. So, no wonder it simplifies the Incomprehensible in an attempt to compre=
hend! That is what Buddha ended up doing. However, logical mind has a great=
 appeal in the Age of Reason in this Kali yuga. No wonder Buddha was/is/wil=
l be a great spiritual force in this world in this age.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
If you dismiss Parasara's linking of=
 planets to avataras as a possible corruption, are you absolutely sure that=
 the verses of SB you are relying on are perfect? (In any case, it's a diff=
erent matter that you are only taking some SB verses and ignoring some as I=
 showed!.)
=A0
The bottomline as far as I am concerned is that Pararsara's =
list actually makes amazingly coherent esoteric sense. The nature of each a=
spect of consciousness (e.g. Buddha - spirit of comprehension, Saturn - spi=
rit of patience & persistence, Venus - spirit of happiness etc) and the sto=
ry of
 corresponding avatara DOES have a highly meaningful connection, esot=
erically speaking. After all, esoterically is how you really need to unders=
tand any higher scriptures and notions in them.
=A0
If we take scriptures l=
iterally instead and draw lopsided conclusions, some would conclude that Sh=
iva is the "supreme" one and other deities are "inferior"; some would concl=
ude that Surya is the "supreme" one and other deities are "inferior"; and s=
o on.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
On a differen=
t note, someone may think that Kali, being Aadyaa, is superior to Tara and =
like Kali more. But, some learned yogis have declared them to be essentiall=
y the same and some scriptures even prohibited differentiating between them=
. As I see it, the difference between them is too subtle for even rishis to=
 clearly comprehend. People seeing
 some significant difference between the=
m are, I am afraid, merely projecting their own conditioning. Same in the c=
ase of Krishna and Rama. Both were=A0 perfectly detached and fully divine k=
arma yogis.
=A0
If we think about it, perfected mind (paramatma aspect repr=
esented by Moon) and soul (paramatma aspect represented by Sun) are not rea=
lly that different. So I am afraid Krishna and Rama are not that different,=
 though the specifics of their stories may be different.
=A0
One last word =
though. If someone truly believes that Krishna is superior to Rama and wors=
hips Krishna (or vice versa!), I am very happy for such a person. My argume=
nts are more for the sake of sharing thinking/knowledge and pushing the bou=
ndaries of understanding in the long run, than changing the minds of anyone=
 in the short run. In the end, everyone of us will have to go through one's=
 own cycles of various tamasik, rajasik and saattwik stages of evolution be=
fore one starts grasping some fistfuls of Reality. These concepts are too s=
ubtle for anyone to convince others or be absolutely confident oneself!
=A0=

Krishnarpanamastu,
Narasimha

Namaste,

>

>I have a different view point. Let me write do=
wn as I see it, in point by point manner.
>
>
>1. In the Bhagwata Purana, t=
here are a list of 22 Avataras of Vishnu. In this list of 22, Varaha Avatar=
a is the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya is the 10th Avatara. Dattatreya, Nara-nara=
yana,Vyasa Deva himself are in this list, and then the Bhagawata Purana goe=
s ontu mention that the Avatars of Vishnu are innumerable. In the 10th Cant=
o, Vyasa says all these Avatars, and innumerable others, are amsas of the S=
upreme Being while Krshna is "swayam Bhagawan."
>
>
>2. Of these various po=
ssible Avataras, 10, or rather 9 as I believe, are/have been accorded speci=
al mention and significance across various Hindu spiritual literature, spec=
ially those which were composed in the Kali-Yuga, namely the Puranas.[When =
Krshna was alive, it was Kali-Sandhya, his physical presence had curtailed =
the full effect of Kali,once he left his body, Kali started in full flow. A=
ll Puranas were composed after this, hence these are scriptures of the Kali=
-Yuga, as are Tantras]
>
>
>3. These 10/9 Avataras have a fixed sequence of=
 appearance. Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, K=
rshna, (Buddha) and Kalki. There is an unmistakeable connection of the form=
 and sequence of these main avatars with the evolution of life on earth. Fr=
om the aquatic, to the amphibian, to the land-animal, to the half-animal-ha=
lf-man, to the dwarf man (first human life form who immediately takes posse=
ssion of this earth represented by Vamana's 3 steps), to the Rajashik avata=
ra of Parashurama moving around with an axe, to the Sattwa Guna Avatara of =
Rama, to the Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, this indicates that spiritual=
ity is not to be separated into another world, but is a progressive realiza=
tion of the various manifestation and potentials that lie inherent in the c=
onsciousness and its development through various life-forms. Larger spiritu=
ality of earth and evolution go hand in hand. That is Nature's grand design=
 for life on earth.
>
>
>4. In this specifc context, I am only focusing on =
the parable of these main 9/10 Avatars. It is not my contention that if one=
 worships say Matysa Avatara, one will not attain to a state of liberation =
of the soul. As is the nature of spiritual cosmology in Hinduism, any Devat=
a can lead a person to any depth of realization. And each one of the Avatar=
s of Vishnu are self-realized in their own way and can be consider super-ma=
ssive spiritual dynamos.
>
>
>
>=A05. Of these, naturally, Rama and Krshna =
are most adored because they represent a stage of evolution, both inside as=
 well as outside, which society can relate of much easier, in this age. Ram=
a represents, for me, the stage of most satwic mind. A satwic mind is in co=
ntrol of itself. It known how to transform the animal tendencies within and=
 without - monkeys - into a constructive force for a greater purpose. Howev=
er, as with a state of full Sattwa Guna, there can be instances, even thoug=
h few, of dejection. For it is static in nature and will change only when c=
ircumstances force it to. As per the Valmiki Ramayana, Rama did feel deject=
ed while searching for Sita in the forest. He did have a moments fear befor=
e the final assault on Ravana, which was dispelled by Agsatha when the late=
r revealed the stotra of the Sun to Rama. At the end of the final battle, R=
ama tells Sita, in a most dispassionate manner, that he killed Ravana not t=
o rescue her, but it was
 the Dharma to do so, and to unhold his family hon=
our. That too was the dharma of that age when he lived, family honor. The w=
ay I look at this grand epic, and I bow humbly to the genius of Rishis Valm=
iki for representing the things as they are, as a scribe, as a poet, as an =
observer, and not adding his own preferences to it anywhere, in the 14 year=
s of tribulation that Rama faced which culminated into his killing Ravana, =
he changed into the most dispassionate leader, such that no personal consid=
eration or emotions or passions can overturn the Rajadharma. His life is a =
lesson of what a true leader must be!
>
>Krshna, OTOH, had this immaculate =
detachment right from birth. I am not taking his=A0 supernatural feats into=
 account. It is his singular and constant detachment from situations, from =
people, from environment,
 from circumstances that mark his life. At the ag=
e of eight, he decides to leave Vrindavana for Mathura. All his friends, hi=
s foster parents, his village-folks who so loved him, pleaded with him that=
 it would make no sense for him to leave the shelter, love and comfort of h=
is happy, settled village life and head into an unknown destiny and destina=
tion. Krshna tried to reason with them, then he understood that they won't =
understand, he promised he will return back once his work in Mathura is ove=
r. He never returned. Later, much later, when the Gopis came to him asking =
him to participate in their dance, he obliged. But the moment some of them =
started getting jealous and possessive of Krshna, he removed himself quietl=
y from the scene, saying that he belongs to everyone equally and no one has=
 any special right over him. When Shishupala abused Krshna, the later merel=
y kept dropping flowers on the floor, smiling and counting. The moment the =
100th abuse was
 over, he swiftly cut off Shishupala's head and was back in=
to his poise. But when Bhurishrava unfairly accused Krshna of being a revol=
utionist and charlatan, Krshna did not kill him. When Duryodhana, who used =
to think of Krshna as another black magician, wanted to arrest him, Krshna =
showed his vikarala roopa in the assembly of kings, yet he did not finish t=
he enemies off. The very next moment he was back into his own poised self. =
Never in the whole Mahabharata is there one instance of his going overboard=
, never a single shade of depression, equivocation, or lack of confidence i=
n his actions, irrespective of what others say or think of him. And then ri=
ght in the middle of the greatest war he had the perfect equipoise to deliv=
er the most sublime spiritual philosophy. That is why his life remains the =
best ideal of Karma-Yoga. For a true Karma-Yogi by definition can never be =
dejected. It is impossible. Neither the action nor the results belong to th=
e
 instrument. When running away from the battle-field and killing Kaliya Y=
avana, or when advising Bheema to tear apart Jarashanda, or gesturing Bheem=
a to hit Duryodhana below the waist, or getting Shikhandi to face Bhisma, K=
rshna, as if by some Divine Intuition, knew exactly how the situations must=
 be lined up which would cause the destruction of these people. This kind o=
f knowledge cannot come by the rational thinking. But happens when one is c=
onstantly and consciously connected to the Universal Force. We do not find =
these kind of complex situations in the Rama Avatara, at least in the Valmi=
ki Ramayana. Of course, if we take the Adhbut Ramayana or such other auxill=
iary texts and retelling, we get a different picture. In the Adbhuta Ramaya=
na we have a 1000 headed demon attacking Rama after he kills Ravana, and th=
en Sita turns into Adya Shakti and demolishes the 1000 headed demon and Ram=
a worships her. But if we take only the Ramayana and the Mahabharata,
 the =
picture that emerges is very clear. Rama is the embodiment of Sattwic mind.=
 Therefore he displays all the great characteristics of satwa, chief of whi=
ch is self-control, as well as the occasional sadness caused due to separat=
ion from his wife Sita whom, at least until Ravana was destroyed, he loved =
very dearly. Satwa guna creates a true saint, but can also cause some grief=
 when the stability is shaken. Krshna was gunatita. He had no attachment to=
 anything in this world - man, women, deva, danava, friend, enemy - and the=
refore he was never affected any trace of negative emotion. His Ananda neve=
r left him even in the most trying situations.
>
>6. Buddha was great spiri=
tual force in this world. But I do not see him fit in the scheme of evoluti=
onary Avatars. His realization, the one he advocated, is a static realizati=
on, an end in a void. This is clearly denying of the reality of this earth.=
 I find this not in tune with what either Rama or Krshna
 espoused. None of=
 them negated this world. If negation of this world and life is the final a=
im, then why send so many avatars at crucial stages of evolutionary develop=
ment? If the spiritual impact on masses is the reason for Buddha being an A=
vatara, then why not Jesus or Zorathrusta.? They are no less impactful in t=
hat sense. But do they fit in the scheme of spiritual line that these 9 Ava=
taras of Narayana indicate in a most logical manner? No. As such many vaish=
nava traditions in parts of India, do not consider Buddha to be an avatara.=
 Realization, to be complete and holistic, must be both static and dynamic,=
 outside of life as well as inside of life. That is why the Tantras formed =
their own kind of spiritual philosophy, of the world as body of Shakti and =
therefore an object of reverence and realization.
>
>7. The original litera=
ture of the Nath Yogis used to mention 9 chakras. These are centers of psyc=
hological functions. 6 inside the human body
 and 3 too subtle, or non-deve=
loped in most people, even seekers. It is my belief that each of the 9 Avat=
aras - excluding Buddha - correspond to the full power and force of one of =
these 9 Chakras. Similarly, the 9 grahas, or that which can modify consciou=
sness or allow the consciousness to explore and express itself is various p=
ossiblities, are 9 in number. The lagna is a reference point and not a grah=
a. Therefore the chief Avatars who represent the parable of evolution are n=
ine in number. And the ninth of the sequence is yet to come.
>
>8. I cannot=
 comment on which graha would typically represent which Avatara. I know of =
what the BPHS says, however, it is my belief - feel free to disagree with i=
t -:)[one cannot rule out some deep-rooted corruption of understanding or t=
extual misrepresentation in this Kali-Yuga] - that the Atmah among the Avat=
aras has not yet appeared. It will be Kalki, or as Vimalananda seems to say=
 in the Aghora books, Nishkalanka
 - the stainless one. There is only one t=
hing which is perfectly stainless, the Atmah .After a Nirguna/Gunatita awas=
tha comes living in the full and complete purity and might and force and st=
rength of the Atmah. By the sheer dint of his purity the last Avatara will =
burn away opposing forces of this world and fulfill the purpose of evolutio=
n. Even Krshna used diplomacy at various points in his adult life to achiev=
e his ends. Kalki, I am speculating, won't even need that. The white horse =
and that sword is a metaphor. He will be the only one capable enough to rec=
tify the various errors and corruptions that beset our age. 
>
>Well, this =
is how I look at the story of Avataras. It is perfectly ok not to agree wit=
h my views, but I am reasonably sanguine now that this is what is closer to=
 truth.

ajarshi,<br> <br>Very nice to hear from you!<br> <br>The "unmista=
keable" link to the *physical* evolution of life on earth does not imply an=
 increasing sequence of *spiritual* perfection, as you cannot directly map =
the physical to the spiritual. More importantly, if your understanding is c=
orrect, why isn't perfection occurring in the FINAL incarnation but occurri=
ng well before?<br> <br>*        *&=
nbsp;       *<br> <br>First, regarding K=
rishna being a "poornavatara", SrimadBhagavatam (SB) does not say that Rama=
 is
 not one. In fact, Parasara, father of Vyasa, explicitly mentioned that=
 Rama, Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha are "poornavataras"
 (used that exact =
expression) while other avataras have some amount of jivatmamsa too (though=
 paramatmamsa dominates jivatmamsa).<br> <br>Secondly, after describin=
g the avataras, SB says that there are in fact innumerable avataras and tha=
t all rishis, munis, manus, demigods etc are avataras of Supreme Lord. It i=
s under THAT context that 1.3.28 then proceeds to say "these avataras are p=
artial, while Krishna is Lord Himself." I question if the deduction that Kr=
ishna *alone* is Lord Himself and Rama is not is accurate! It only seems to=
 say that all these rishis, manus, demigods etc are partial. As I said abov=
e, Pararsara explicitly said that both Rama and Krishna are poornavataras.<=
br> <br>Third, let us ask a very fundamental question: What exactly do=
es it mean if an avatara is "Lord Himself"?<br> <br>*   =
;     *        *<br>=
 <br>While SB talks of Krishna being "Lord
 Himself" in 1.3.28, it als=
o says in 1.3.30: "forms of Supreme Lord, who is in
 reality formless (arUp=
a) and of the nature of pure consciousness (chidAtman), are manufactured by=
 the qualities of Maya". In the next verse, it further compares forms of Lo=
rd to clouds in sky and dirt in air. Just as sky *contains* clouds and is b=
eyond them, similarly Lord *contains* forms and is beyond them. So, again, =
what is the meaning of a specific form that descended on earth being "Lord =
Himself"? I am afraid people may be misinterpreting this notion based on th=
eir fancies and conditioning..<br> <br>All beings are made up of param=
atma (supreme/absolute being) and jivatma (living/relative being). The latt=
er portion is dominant in us and is responsible for desires and rebirth. Gr=
eat avataras descend from a higher portion of paramatma. Very rarely avatar=
as descend entirely from paramatma without ANY jivatma portion. Rama and Kr=
ishna are specific examples given by Parasara.<br> <br>They are entire=
ly divine, but they do not encapsulate the
 entire divinity!!!! After all,
=
 "entire divinity" cannot be encapsulated by any form just as no cloud can =
contain the entire sky. They take part in the drama obeying and executing t=
he divine will but NOT altering it. This applies to Krishna as well as Rama=
.<br> <br>*        *  &nb=
sp;     *<br> <br>> Buddha was great spiritual =
force in this world. But I do not<br>> see him fit in the scheme of evol=
utionary Avatars. His<br>> realization, the one he advocated, is a stati=
c realization,<br>> an end in a void.<br> <br>First, he IS mentione=
d in SB list of avataras as well as Parasara's list. If he does not "fit" i=
n your "scheme of evolutionary Avatars", then your concept is possibly wron=
g and avataras are perhaps not "evolutionary" as you theorize.<br> <br=
>Secondly, as per Parasara,
 Buddha corresponds to Mercury, who personifies=
 logical mind and the spirit of investigation and comprehension. Logical mi=
nd and its </span><span id=3D"yiv4763702353yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_151">=

ion is not capable of grasping the Absolute Reality completely, for it is b=
eyond comprehension. So, no wonder it simplifies the Incomprehensible in an=
 attempt to comprehend! That is what Buddha ended up doing. However, logica=
l mind has a great appeal in the Age of Reason in this Kali yuga. No wonder=
 Buddha was/is/will be a great spiritual force in this world in this age.<b=
r> <br>*        *   =
     *<br> <br>If you dismiss Parasara's linking o=
f planets to avataras as a possible corruption, are you absolutely sure tha=
t the verses of SB you
 are relying on are perfect? (In any case, it's a di=
fferent matter that you are only taking some SB verses and ignoring some as=
 I showed!.)<br> <br>The bottomline as far as I am concerned is that P=
ararsara's list actually makes amazingly coherent esoteric sense. The natur=
e of each aspect of consciousness (e.g. Buddha - spirit of comprehension, S=
aturn - spirit of patience & persistence, Venus - spirit of happiness e=
tc) and the story of
 corresponding avatara DOES have a highly meaningful c=
onnection, esoterically speaking. After all, esoterically is how you really=
 need to understand any higher scriptures and notions in them.<br> <br=
>If we take scriptures literally instead and draw lopsided conclusions, som=
e would conclude that Shiva is the "supreme" one and other deities are "inf=
erior"; some would conclude that Surya is the "supreme" one and other deiti=
es are "inferior"; and so on.<br> <br>*     &=
nbsp;  *        *<br> <br>On a=
 different note, someone may think that Kali, being Aadyaa, is superior to =
Tara and like Kali more. But, some learned yogis have declared them to be e=
ssentially the same and some scriptures even prohibited differentiating bet=
ween them. As I see it, the difference between them is too subtle for even =
rishis to clearly comprehend. People seeing
 some significant difference be=
tween them are, I am afraid, merely projecting their own conditioning. Same=
 in the case of Krishna and Rama. Both were  perfectly detached and fu=
lly divine karma yogis.<br> <br>If we think about it, perfected mind (=

bsp;5. Of these, naturally, Rama and Krshna are most adored because they re=
present a stage of evolution, both inside as well as outside, which society=
 can relate of much easier, in this age. Rama represents, for me, the stage=
 of most satwic mind. A satwic mind is in control of itself. It known how t=
o transform the animal tendencies within and without - monkeys - into a con=
structive force for a greater purpose. However, as with a state of full Sat=
twa Guna, there can be instances, even though few, of dejection. For it is =
static in
 nature and will change only when circumstances force it to. As p=
er the Valmiki Ramayana, Rama did feel dejected while searching for Sita in=
 the forest. He did have a moments fear before the final assault on Ravana,=

 which was dispelled by Agsatha when the later revealed the stotra of the =
Sun to Rama.
 At the end of the final battle, Rama tells Sita, in a most di=
spassionate manner, that he killed Ravana not to rescue her, but it was the=
 Dharma to do so, and to unhold his family honour. That too was the dharma =
of that age when he lived, family honor. The way I look at this grand epic,=
 and I bow humbly to the genius of Rishis Valmiki for representing the thin=
gs as they are, as a scribe, as a poet, as an observer, and not adding his =
own preferences to it anywhere, in the 14 years of tribulation that Rama fa=
ced which culminated into his killing Ravana, he changed into the most disp=
assionate leader, such that no personal consideration or emotions or passio=
ns can overturn the Rajadharma. His life is a lesson of what a true leader =
must be!<br><br>Krshna, OTOH, had this immaculate detachment right from bir=
th. I am not taking his  supernatural feats into account. It is his si=
ngular and constant detachment from situations, from people, from environme=
nt,
 from circumstances that mark his life. At the age of eight, he decides=
 to leave Vrindavana for Mathura. All his friends, his foster parents, his =
village-folks who so loved him, pleaded with him that it would make no sens=
e for him to leave the shelter, love and comfort of his happy, settled vill=
age life and head into an unknown destiny and destination. Krshna tried to =
reason with them, then he understood that they won't understand, he promise=
d he will return back once his work in Mathura is over. He never returned. =
Later, much later, when the Gopis came to him asking him to participate in =
their dance, he obliged. But the moment some of them started getting jealou=
s and possessive of Krshna, he removed himself quietly from the scene, sayi=
ng that he belongs to everyone equally and no one has any special right ove=
r him. When Shishupala abused Krshna, the later merely kept dropping flower=
s on the floor, smiling and counting. The moment the 100th abuse was
 over,=
 he swiftly cut off Shishupala's head and was back into his poise. But when=
 Bhurishrava unfairly accused Krshna of being a revolutionist and charlatan=
, Krshna did not kill him. When Duryodhana, who used to think of Krshna as =
another black magician, wanted to arrest him, Krshna showed his vikarala ro=
opa in the assembly of kings, yet he did not finish the enemies off. The ve=
ry next moment he was back into his own poised self. Never in the whole Mah=
abharata is there one instance of his going overboard, never a single shade=
 of depression, equivocation, or lack of confidence in his actions, irrespe=
ctive of what others say or think of him. And then right in the middle of t=
he greatest war he had the perfect equipoise to deliver the most sublime sp=
iritual philosophy. That is why his life remains the best ideal of Karma-Yo=
ga. For a true Karma-Yogi by definition can never be dejected. It is imposs=
ible. Neither the action nor the results belong to the
 instrument. When ru=
nning away from the battle-field and killing Kaliya Yavana, or when advisin=
g Bheema to tear apart Jarashanda, or gesturing Bheema to hit Duryodhana be=
low the waist, or getting Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krshna, as if by some D=
ivine Intuition, knew exactly how the situations must be lined up which wou=
ld cause the destruction of these people. This kind of knowledge cannot com=
e by the rational thinking. But happens when one is constantly and consciou=
sly connected to the Universal Force. We do not find these kind of complex =
situations in the Rama Avatara, at least in the Valmiki Ramayana. Of course=
, if we take the Adhbut Ramayana or such other auxilliary texts and retelli=
ng, we get a different picture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana we have a 1000 head=
ed demon attacking Rama after he kills Ravana, and then Sita turns into Ady=
a Shakti and demolishes the 1000 headed demon and Rama worships her. But if=
 we take only the Ramayana and the Mahabharata,
 the picture that emerges i=
s very clear. Rama is the embodiment of Sattwic mind. Therefore he displays=
 all the great characteristics of satwa, chief of which is self-control, as=
 well as the occasional sadness caused due to separation from his wife Sita=
 whom, at least until Ravana was destroyed, he loved very dearly. Satwa gun=
a creates a true saint, but can also cause some grief when the stability is=
 shaken. Krshna was gunatita. He had no attachment to anything in this worl=
d - man, women, deva, danava, friend, enemy - and therefore he was never af=
fected any trace of negative emotion. His Ananda never left him even in the=
 most trying situations.<br><br>6. Buddha was great spiritual force in this=
 world. But I do not see him fit in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His=
 realization, the one he advocated, is a static realization, an end in a vo=
id. This is clearly denying of the reality of this earth. I find this not i=
n tune with what either Rama or Krshna
 espoused. None of them negated this=
 world. If negation of this world and life is the final aim, then why send =
so many avatars at crucial stages of evolutionary development? If the spiri=
tual impact on masses is the reason for Buddha being an Avatara, then why n=
ot Jesus or Zorathrusta.? They are no less impactful in that sense. But do =
they fit in the scheme of spiritual line that these 9 Avataras of Narayana =
indicate in a most logical manner? No. As such many vaishnava traditions in=
 parts of India, do not consider Buddha to be an avatara. Realization, to b=
e complete and holistic, must be both static and dynamic, outside of life a=
s well as inside of life. That is why the Tantras formed their own kind of =
spiritual philosophy, of the world as body of Shakti and therefore an objec=
t of reverence and realization.<br><br>7. The original literature of the Na=
th Yogis used to mention 9 chakras. These are centers of psychological func=
tions. 6 inside the human body
 and 3 too subtle, or non-developed in most =
people, even seekers. It is my belief that each of the 9 Avataras - excludi=
ng Buddha - correspond to the full power and force of one of these 9 Chakra=
s. Similarly, the 9 grahas, or that which can modify consciousness or allow=
 the consciousness to explore and express itself is various possiblities, a=
re 9 in number. The lagna is a reference point and not a graha. Therefore t=
he chief Avatars who represent the parable of evolution are nine in number.=
 And the ninth of the sequence is yet to come.<br><br>8. I cannot comment o=
n which graha would typically represent which Avatara. I know of what the B=
PHS says, however, it is my belief - feel free to disagree with it -:)[one =
cannot rule out some deep-rooted corruption of understanding or textual mis=
representation in this Kali-Yuga] - that the Atmah among the Avataras has n=
ot yet appeared. It will be Kalki, or as Vimalananda seems to say in the Ag=
hora books, Nishkalanka
 - the stainless one. There is only one thing which=
 is perfectly stainless, the Atmah .After a Nirguna/Gunatita awastha comes =
living in the full and complete purity and might and force and strength of =
the Atmah. By the sheer dint of his purity the last Avatara will burn away =
opposing forces of this world and fulfill the purpose of evolution. Even Kr=
shna used diplomacy at various points in his adult life to achieve his ends=
. Kalki, I am speculating, won't even need that. The white horse and that s=
word is a metaphor. He will be the only one capable enough to rectify the v=
arious errors and corruptions that beset our age. <br><br>Well, this is how=
 I look at the story of Avataras. It is perfectly ok not to agree with my v=
iews, but I am reasonably sanguine now that this is what is closer to truth=

bsp;   *<br> <br>Let us focus on Rama and Krishna, i.e. soul=

 he did whatever was his "dharma". He helped Vishwamitra. Soon after marria=
ge, he was given kingdom. At the last moment, his father banished him to fo=
rest at the behest of his step-mother and his step-brother was given the th=
rone. He had no complaints. Though his father, step-mother and step-brother=
 felt guilty to various degrees, he himself supported and consoled all thre=
e and followed his dharma impassionately. Though he knew leaving Sita in th=
e forest
 with Lakshmana and going after the golden deer would cause proble=
ms, he did it impassionately when Sita insisted. When she was kidnapped by =
Ravana, he searched for her and fought the battle. He never faulted Sita fo=
r forcing him to leave her or faulted Lakshmana for leaving her later. He a=
ccepted every life situation with no complaints and did the best possible a=
ction then. Even as he killed Ravana, he did so without hatred or anger, bu=
t as his impassionate dharma. Even as Ravana was dying, he went to him and =
respectfully learned some subjects that were going to disappear with Ravana=
