Namaste,
=A0
I know those who are excited by these new age ideas like "past=
 life regression" will be badly upset with honest views, but let me state m=
y view.

=A0
It is possible to remember past life. 
However, if such memory=
 does not come at a very young age due to some deep 
desires from past life=
 or an unnatural death before, it is not easy to get it later. Even for a g=
reat yogi with tremendous self-control, calming the mind down to suppress 
=
current conditioning sufficiently to remember past life is not easy.
=A0
Fo=
r example, at least 3 saints/yogis of a high spiritual caliber claimed to b=
e re-incarnations of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. If such saints cannot accurat=
ely know their own past life, anybody thinking that someone else can make o=
ne aware of one's past life is just kidding oneself.
=A0
Remembering past l=
ife or making someone else do so, is not at all easy. In comparison, halluc=
inating that one remembered past life or making someone else 
hallucinate t=
hat one remembered past life, is certainly very easy! In fact, I suspect th=
at is what happens in most past life regressions..

=A0
There is a deep rea=
son why 
Nature has built this mechanism of forgetting a life when another =
life 
starts. Otherwise, this game will end very quickly. This forgetfulnes=
s prolongs the game very much and makes it far more interesting.
=A0
Best r=
egards,

Narasimha

a Chandika. References to this form can be found in the Rudrayamala, at lea=

 by
 followers of Shakta/Aghor traditions for protection again=

 of cremation ground.

>>>Generally, at least 10/11 malas of the same should be done in o=

 some visible relief. One more thing is that, IF, this is a really genuine =
instance of spirit possession, as far as I have seen, it would be quite imp=
ossible to rid the problem by any exorcist from a distance. These days almo=
st no one has that kind of terrific shakti to cure a case of possession fro=
m a distance. Physical presence in front of the victim is a must for the on=
e trying to help.=A0So close family members, who live with the girl will ha=
ve to do the sadhana. If you go through the Bhairava homam manual by Narasi=
mha, you will find methods of doing homas with this mantra. But I guess bei=
ng in a foreign land homas may not be that easy.
>>>
>>>If the family visit=
s India, then I have a suggestion. Please ask them, if possible, to visit K=
ashi and then go to either the Kalabhairava or Vatuka Bhairava temple. Once=
 inside the temple speak to the main priest stating the problem. Around the=
se two temples in Kashi, many excellent sadhakas of Bhairava live who are a=
depts in removing any kind of negative influence. They may charge a certain=
 fee for the ritual and then ask the parents and the girl to come with some=
 specific samagris on a specific day/tithi inside the temple and then perfo=
rm their rituals. Many I know have actually benefited. This is one method. =
I am sure their maybe other methods too. I just wrote what came to my mind.=

>>>
>>>A possession by a foreign entity, IF gen=

>>>
>>>Upayas are many. As so many different people=

ple factors. Basically, there is no guarantee of any method. It all depends=
 on what kind of spirit(s)/being(s) has possessed the individual and what t=
heir link for the same is. By link it means one has to find out the root, o=
r source of exactly what action allowed them to enter into the person. Some=
times it can be
 something
 as simple as spitting somewhere (where this bei=
ng(s) reside), or
 causally entering into their territory and being suscept=
ible to such possession by certain weakness in the mind and body, or in som=
e cases where such entities are deliberately send to cause harm to an indiv=
idual, ETC ETC. Whatever be the source, there is no sure shot one stop meth=
od of removing and handling such a situation. It all depends on the shakti =
of the spirit, and the amount of shakti that those trying to help are able =
to generate in order to remove the spirit.Moreover, if the spirit of a viol=
ent and extremely malevolent nature, then unless the person trying to remov=
e it is an adept in this, he/she may come to serious harm.
>>>
>>>These thi=
ngs like removing possession are specializations. These do not fall under t=

 any sadhaka with even basic common sense would do best to stay away. Every=
 action has its repercussion and one must know well how to
 handle the same=
 too. Again
 if a spirit is removed by force before the time till which, ba=
sed on previous karma, it was supposed to be in possession of the individua=
l, then that too starts a new karmic chain which will involve some not so p=
leasant consequences for the person who tried to remove the spirit. It is a=
ll a complex chain.
>>>
>>>[Reminds me of a particular individual I knew so=
me years ago who was an expert in exorcism. But before starting any exorcis=
m he would ask his Guides to tell him about the spirit as well as the time =
frame for which the spirit would stay in possession as per the previous kar=
mic link between the spirit and the victim. Then he would sit and do ritual=
s daily to entice the spirit to leave the body of its own free will, promis=
ing good deeds for the spirit in return. Never trying to remove it by force=
. Most cases it would work. Rare cases where the spirit is of a very violen=
t nature, force had to be applied.]
>>>
>>>Best thing to do is a) find some=
one
 who knows exactly how to deal with spirit possession and hope for the =
best. b) In the event the first is not possible, ask family members to pick=
 sadhana/mantra of any deity - preferably Bhairava, Kali, Chandi, Narasimha=
,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are better) - and do it with samkal=
pa with sufficient force and will and time. Which means, a 10-20 mins path =
of hanuman chalisa may not help. Depends on the degree of possession. Someo=
ne may have to spend 3-5 hours daily with any sadhana with the mental belie=
f/faith/will/determination to see this through to the very end. While doing=
 the sadhana keep a bowl of water in a copper pot, and then either make the=
 possessed individual drink the water or sprinkle it on him/her. And pray a=

 mother is Sahashra Chandika. References to this form can be found in the R=

 followers of Shakta/Aghor traditions fo=

sible relief. One more thing is that, IF, this is a really genuine instance=
 of spirit possession, as far as I have seen, it would be quite impossible =
to rid the problem by any exorcist from a distance. These days almost no on=
e has that kind of terrific shakti to cure a case of possession from a dist=
ance. Physical presence in front of the victim is a must for
 the one tryin=
g to help. So close family members, who live with the girl
 will
 have=
 to do the sadhana. If you go through the Bhairava homam manual by Narasimh=
a, you will find methods of doing homas with this mantra. But I guess being=
 in a foreign land homas may not be that easy.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=

them, if possible, to visit Kashi and then go to either the Kalabhairava or=
 Vatuka Bhairava temple. Once inside the temple speak to the main priest st=
ating the problem. Around these two temples in Kashi, many excellent sadhak=
as of Bhairava live who are adepts in removing any kind of negative influen=
ce. They may charge a certain fee for the ritual and then ask the parents a=
nd the girl to come with some specific samagris on a specific day/tithi ins=
ide the temple and then perform their rituals. Many I know have actually be=

a case of possession.  But none of the two have been able to do anythi=

actually work in a specific case or not depends on multiple factors. Basica=
lly, there is no guarantee of any method. It all depends on what kind of sp=
irit(s)/being(s) has possessed the individual and what their link for the s=
ame is. By link it means one has to find out the root, or source of exactly=
 what action allowed them to enter into the person. Sometimes it can be
 so=
mething
 as simple as spitting somewhere (where this being(s) reside), or
 =
causally entering into their territory and being susceptible to such posses=
sion by certain weakness in the mind and body, or in some cases where such =
entities are deliberately send to cause harm to an individual, ETC ETC. Wha=
tever be the source, there is no sure shot one stop method of removing and =
handling such a situation. It all depends on the shakti of the spirit, and =
the amount of shakti that those trying to help are able to generate in orde=
r to remove the spirit.Moreover, if the spirit of a violent and extremely m=
alevolent nature, then unless the person trying to remove it is an adept in=
 this, he/she may come to serious harm.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none=

all under the ambit of normal sadhana. Unless one knows well what one is ge=
tting into, any sadhaka with even basic common sense would do best to stay =
away. Every action has its repercussion and one must know well how to
 hand=
le the same too. Again
 if a spirit is removed by force before the time til=
l which, based on previous karma, it was supposed to be in possession of th=
e individual, then that too starts a new karmic chain which will involve so=
me not so pleasant consequences for the person who tried to remove the spir=
it. It is all a complex chain.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">[Remind=
s me of a particular individual I knew some years ago who was an expert in =
exorcism. But before starting any exorcism he would ask his Guides to tell =
him about the spirit as well as the time frame for which the spirit would s=
tay in possession as per the previous karmic link between the spirit and th=
e victim. Then he would sit and do rituals daily to entice the spirit to le=
ave the body of its own free will, promising good deeds for the spirit in r=
eturn. Never trying to remove it by force. Most cases it would work. Rare c=
ases where the spirit is of a very violent nature, force had to be applied.=
