Namaste friends,
 
I am forwarding a mail from Lalit Mishra, which was cc'e=
d to vedic-wisdom but not delivered as he is not a member. I am forwarding =
it to the list as a courtesy.
 
I request members to kindly not respond to =
any personal comments or personal judgments and stick to the subject matter=
. If you have any comment on a technical point, please feel free to discuss=
 it. But I'd appreciate if people can stick to technical points and show so=
me respect and coutesy to others even when disagreeing. Even when the other=
 person is abusive, please show restraint and not become provoked.
 
Just t=
o clarify, I never warned people against Guru Gorakshanath or his path as a=
lleged below. How can I, when my guru belongs to his path? I only warned ag=
ainst attributing to Guru Gorakshanath misconceptions that go against the e=
ssence of Vedic wisdom and the teachings of Dattatreya, who is the original=
 guru of Naths. This was elaborated in my mail yesterday.
 
Best regards,
N=
arasimha

    Guru Gorakhnath himself as w=
ell as tradition is alive and continued,
    Gorakhpur in up and a town in =
bihar (not remembering name) had got
    established ashrams, some follower=
s are found in maharastra and punjab
    as well.

    Once i met a young n=
ath follower who was a brahmin before getting
    deeksha, he mentiond that=
 a distant place one of their guru is alive
    even for more than 800 yrs,=
 the nath guy was hardly in 20s, over
    excited in powe of mantras, he wa=
s able to create fier by chanting a
    mantra, as i was already aware of s=
uch agni ban mantras, we became
    friends, they have got post card system=
 for communication, young naths
    are alloted 50 - 100 kms area to do sad=
hana under the super vision of
    a Sr nath living nearby area.

    Guru =
Gorakhnath is  the great saint who kept our religion intigrated
    in diff=
icult time of 5th to 12th century. He met Adi Shankaracharya,
    Guru Nana=
k, Kabir and Vigyaneswar of maharastra, so many people still
    claim to h=
ave been guided or blessed by Guru Gorakhnath.

    Narsimha is living in u=
tmost darkness and trying to become a guru of
    darkness, neither he has =
got self knowledge or enlightenment by self
    sadhana nor by study of sha=
stras, result is, he has become a victim of
    own trapings living within =
a small well of perception, so, what fits
    into his uneducated perceptio=
n, he presents that as his wisdom, this
    is not only wrong but its fatal=
 also.

    He is so much insecured that he warns people to not to get carr=
ied
    away by Guru Gorakhnath or his path, may be, he thinks that Guru
  =
  Gorakhnath can mislead people ? Narrow mindness and limitati=C3=B6ns are
=
    first sign of ignorence.

    'Alakh Niranjan' is the light that nath t=
radition spread in india.

    You all wd have heard that devatas and tirth=
as live in body, this is
    precisely discovered by Guru Gorakhnath and be=
autifuly writen in his
    scriptures, luckily some of his work is availabl=
e though rare.

    Unlike others, Guru Gorakhnath discovered 5 dimensions =
of speech, 5
    properties of kundalini, 5 type of powers of both para,apa=
ra and
    sukshma shakti.

    By their sadhana, they turn their body to '=
Para Pinda' this is
    described in Yajur Veda also, there are 5 Parampada=
, 5 Shunyas, 5
    Niranjana. 5 Ananda, 5 Chit Udaya, 5 Chit Prakasha, 5 ty=
pes of - 'I'
    ness.

    Our Vedas and Upnishads speak language of 'I', =
 Krishna spoke the
    language of - 'I', understanding 'I'ness is center o=
f our dharma, but,
    becoz, Narsimha lives in dark state of mind, he shou=
ts that I is ego,
    ego could be darkness.

    Since when we have forgot=
ten the vedic language of 'I', we lived in
    slavery, culture, country an=
d religion deteriorate.

    Vedas say - we are complete unit, equal to any=
 soul or saint  bt these
    fake gurus say you are not, you are inferior t=
o others, This is
    because they only have talks and preechings, they don=
't have Tejas of
    Tapasy that a true guru do have, a guru who leads 'I'n=
ess to God.

    Aum Tat Sat

    Regards,
    Lalit Mishra.
