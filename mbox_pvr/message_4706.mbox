Namaste Ranjan,
 
> After you die, what would be your name and religion and=
 nationality
 
Name can change on rebirth. Though religion usually stays th=
e same, it CAN change. Nationality can of course change too. Job, skills, e=
xternal nature, looks, gender, even yoni (human, cow, goat, chicken, tiger =
etc) can all change from birth to birth.
 
Basically, the seed of one's new=
 birth is formed at the time of one's death. As one's connection is severed=
 with the body, the last desires/thoughts/ponderings of the mind become the=
 seed for the next life. Nature chooses for one a future course that allows=
 one to pursue those desires, as much as allowed by one's previous karmas a=
nd debts.
 
If one is able to not entertain ANY desire as one element after=
 another evaporates in one's existence, one becomes liberated. All the spir=
itual sadhana we do is a dress rehearsal.

> when we=
 see you again and do you know how we
> shall recognize you, IF WE EVER MEE=
T YOU?
 
If I and you like each other and your rebirth and my rebirth meet =
each other, they will start off taking a liking to each other. If I and you=
 dislike each other and your rebirth and my rebirth meet each other, they w=
ill start off disliking each other. This will happen without either being c=
onsciously aware of who one was and who the other person was, in the last l=
ife.
 
Instead, if your question is how we can recognize that so and so per=
son is a rebirth of Swami Vivekananda, so and so person is a rebirth of Par=
amahamsa Yogananda etc, the answer is complex.
 
The reborn person may not =
look like the old person or do similar work or have much *external* similar=
ity. So it is difficult to "recognize" one. After all, Rama advocated eka p=
atni vrata (one wife principle), while Krishna had thousands of wives. Rama=
 was a great warrior and killed Ravana in the biggest war of his times. Kri=
shna was a key player in the biggest war of his time, but did not take a we=
apon at all. The game can be diffent in each coming..
 
*        *        *=

 
When it comes to recognizing the rebirth of a great soul, it can become =
a trap.
 
Ramakrishna explicitly told Sarada Mata that he would be back aft=
er 100 years and that everybody else who came with him would have to come b=
ack with him. When Sarada Mata and Lakshmi Devi protested, he said they did=
 not have a choice! Even Swami Vivekananda said once in USA, "I have to com=
e back once more. The Master said I am to come back once more with him". Wh=
en questioned "you have to come back because Shri Ramakrishna says so", he =
replied, "souls like that have great power, Madam". On another occasion, Ra=
makrishna said that people would get liberated en masse during his next com=
ing and that would be the last opportunity for a long time to come.
 
Inter=
estingly, two good saints claimed to be re-incarnations of Ramakrishna sinc=
e then. One of them is wrong (or perhaps both!). Another good saint suggest=
ed that she is the re-incarnation of Sarada Mata. Satya Sai Baba said that =
he identified a particular young man as the reincarnation of Swami Vivekana=
nda. Ramakrishna was surrounded by Sarada Mata and more than twenty discipl=
es of a very high caliber and different aptitudes. Together, they nearly mo=
ulded the direction of spiritual India for the next century. None of the cl=
aimants of rebirthhood are surrounded by people of such caliber or fit the =
bill.
 
Thus, there can be false claimants to the rebirthhood of a great so=
ul! It is not that they are lying. They may simply be deluding themselves a=
nd of course ego is the root of delusion!
 
In fact, is it necessary to rec=
ognize whether X is a rebirth of Y, given that X and Y are different and pl=
ay a different game? A small discussion on this point vis-a-vis Ramakrishna=
 Paramahamsa's example can be found in:
 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ved=
ic-wisdom/message/807
 
*        *        *
 
Though external factors like =
nationality, religion, name, job, looks, gender etc can change, some intern=
al factors may remain the same. Moreover, who one likes, who one dislikes, =
what values one is attracted to internally, etc, may remain essentially the=
 same.
 
For example, suppose rajput king Prithviraj was reborn as Muslim e=
mperor Akbar (as said by Vimalananda). One was a Hindu and the other was a =
Muslim. However, both were very brave, unafraid of death, inherently spirit=
ual, had a refined taste in fine arts and had deep conviction. The previous=
 connections with rajputs resulted in Akbar being born and raised when his =
mother was hiding at a rajput household, before moving to Delhi. Despite be=
ing a Muslim, he actually helped the Hindu causes (to the extent possible a=
t that time) by putting an end to barbaric practices like killing defeated =
Hindu kings and all Hindu priests in conquered places. He promoted acceptan=
ce of other faiths, canceled pilgrimage taxes on Hindus and even came up wi=
th his own religion of humanity towards the end of his life by integrating =
various religions. In one life, he tried to save India from invading barbar=
ians. In another, he was born as a cultured man amid barbarians and tried t=
o save India by changing the ways of his own people. There is a subtle cont=
inuity in the agenda at a deeper level!
