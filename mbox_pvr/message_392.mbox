Namaste,
 
Of course, one can conduct a homam at one's home. In fact, a bra=
ahmana is supposed to do a minimum agni karyam at home everyday. If not a h=
omam for a deity, atleast start fire and make ahutis to Prajapati, Indra, A=
gni etc. That much agni kaaryam a brahmin is supposed to do everyday at hom=
e.
 
In fact, some people used to not only perform a regular homam at home,=
 but cook right next to homam and take fire from homam to start fire in sto=
ve for cooking. Until recently, there were people who were performing homam=
 daily at home.
 
When homam is performed for several special occasions (su=
ch a griha pravesam, upanayanam etc), priests do perform homam at home.
 
T=
he practical difficculty is the smoke from homam. It can be uncomfortable f=
or some people. But it is good. Once, Srila Prabhupada was conducting a hom=
am in an apartment in New York. When poornahuti was offered, there was a lo=
t of smoke. When some people were covering their noses, Srila Prabhupada to=
ld them, "no no, this smoke is very good for you. Don't cover noses."
 
Tho=
se who have trouble with smoke can minimize it by using ghee minimally, avo=
iding wood completely and relying on dry coconut (copra).
 
Yajnas that are=
 done on a bigger scale for specific material goals are typically not perfo=
rmed inside the house. Those are formal events. You are calling several god=
s and appeasing them. After all, you want a specific material thing and are=
 doing "business" with them. So some protocols are to be employed. The plac=
e should be suitable for all of them to come and do "business" with you. Ho=
wever, a homam done for spiritual growth is a personal and informal affair =
and not formal business. Your home is perfectly fine.
 
Probably the confus=
ion arises from yajnas.
 
Mr Babu is the son of a great man. But, unfortuna=
tely, it is not good karma to spread wrong views that may discourage some p=
eople from doing good things. But what to do?
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
