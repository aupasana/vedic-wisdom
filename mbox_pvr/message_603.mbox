Guys,

I am glad everything is sorted out. But, in general, let us be less 
defensive and instead focus on subject. Knowing Ajit's nature, I knew 
exactly what he meant. However, even if Ajit or someone actually said 
something negative about me, it is not a big deal. One is who one is and 
words, good or bad, do not change that, for better or worse. Why be 
sensitive to words then?

Ajit, you are certainly qualified in commenting. I always knew that you have 
tremendous scholarship, great humility and sincerity. People far less 
qualified than you talk/write so much in today's world. Please do write 
more.

The imagery thrown up by the Puranic story mentioned by you is really nice!

Friends,

Lord Hanuman is one who fully overcame lust. He can be worshipped for giving 
self-control.

Lord Hrishikesha gives purity and control over senses (hrishika + isha = 
lord of senses). He can be worshipped for control over senses.

Mother Kaali gives dispassion and kills the root of desires. She can be 
worshipped for getting rid of desires.

Several things are possible. But, for most people in today's times, it is 
not going to be one magic bullet that does it, but a combination of various 
practices. Patience is needed.

Try to increase the understanding of what is permanent and what is 
transient.

Best regards,
Narasimha
