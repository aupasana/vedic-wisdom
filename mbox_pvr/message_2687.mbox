Namaste,
 
Gyaani or jnaani is a wise and learned person, who may or may no=
t debate (or even engage) with others. One may become a gyaani using either=
 gyaana yoga or bhakti yoga or karma yoga or raaja yoga.
 
Gyaana/jnaana yo=
ga is a path of pursuing the Supreme through intellectual analysis. One pur=
suing that path may or may not debate with others and may or may not read m=
any scriptures, but one will analyze and debate within oneself. One starts =
with the basic axioms (e.g. Self is imperishable and without a beginning or=
 an end). One will go on eliminating things that one is aware of as not bei=
ng Self. For example, body has a beginning and end and is perishable. So it=
 is not Self. One introspects like this and, though the process of eliminat=
ion, finally finds the true Self. That is gyaana yoga. Pure gyaana yoga is =
very difficult to follow in this age.
 
Vichaara (contemplation) is the pro=
cess of sadhana for an adherer of pure gyaana yoga.
 
However, the gyaana (=
knowledge of Self) achieved by such a person at the end is not really diffe=
rent from the knowledge of Self achieved by a person following another path=
.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

        Dear Vijay,

        We can see t=
he difference between a body with prana and with out prana. Can't we? Then,=
 why can we try to narrow our focus and try to see prana/atma sceintificall=
y? I am not for this path, but, to say, that is not a path, is perhaps unfa=
ir to all those who are destine to traverse that path.

        My statemen=
t was not against the "path of Gyana". Indeed it is one of the finest path =
I am sure.

        However, my understanding of this path differs a little=
 from your understanding. Gyana, I believe, is not really study of scriptur=
es or scholarly arguments, pros and con, debates etc etc. Gyana, in my opin=
ion, is a state of being,  where one percieves a certain oneness in the uni=
verse. It is achieved through sadhana. To be constantly in a state of discr=
imination between real and not-real, rejecting the non-real, such that what=
ever is finally left is nothing but the eternal. This is the sadhana of the=
 marga called Gyan. But sadhana it is without a doubt.

        Whatever be=
 the path, sadhana is a must to achieve the results. Adi Shankara, they say=
, was an expert in the scriptures and scriptural debates. But I feel, he en=
gaged in all these once he had already become a gyani through his sadhana. =
He was not a gyani because he debated a lot or knew many scriptures, he was=
 a gyani because he had achieved a state of oneness. 

        IMHO, script=
ural knowledge is not the marg of gyana.Gyana marg is more complex and requ=
ires more than mere intellectual abilities.

        -Regards
         Raja=
rshi

          Rajarshi,

          With all due respect, I disagree=
.

          There is no question that is useless and there is no answer th=
at is not relavent. The reason we are not able to perceive God is not that =
God is not there, but, given our current way of thinking, he can not be per=
ceived. By Sadhana, you are trying to calm your mind and infact, make your =
current knowledge influence irrelavent which allows you to percieve thing y=
ou can not otherwise.

          There are 4 known margas for self realisat=
ion. My understanding of any of these limited.
          1. Bhakthi - Surre=
nder to God. Here you rest all other thoughts but for thought pertaining to=
 God. You do not question any thing related to him and give-in completely t=
o the believe that he is there and is your master. By doing so, you are com=
ing out of the clutches of the regular perceptions or dimentions of this ma=
terial world.

          2. Raja - You focus on doing specific postures and=
 concentrate deeply on the way you do things and draw your self away from t=
he regular senses.

          3. Karma - Unattached karma. If you can do it=
, you are not even thinking about God, but, have got him.

          4. jna=
na - By questioning available information, using logic and try to break out=
 of current assumptions and try to discover. Saying, this will not yield re=
sults is not a wise thing. How ever, perhaps, this is the most defficult. B=
ut, with so many others who are experiancing God, not sure, why the wrong i=
n current axioms can not be corrected. Unfortunately, those who are realise=
d, do not perhaps think it is relavent.

          There is a soul. Now is =
Soul physical or not? Can it be seen? If not with naked eyes, to see it mat=
erialistically, what is needed?

          We can see the difference betwee=
n a body with prana and with out prana. Can't we? Then, why can we try to n=
arrow our focus and try to see prana/atma sceintifically? I am not for this=
 path, but, to say, that is not a path, is perhaps unfair to all those who =
are destine to traverse that path.
          Best regards,
          Vijay
