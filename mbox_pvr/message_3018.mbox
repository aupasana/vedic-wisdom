Namaste Hari,
 
Samaadhi is sam+aa+dhi. It is a state of intense mental concentration on something.
 
Kalpa means create or perceive (the word kalpana is from the same root). Vikalpa means existence of variety. Savikalpa means "with vikalpa". Savikalpa samadhi is a state of intense concentration of the mind, while creational variety or objectification still exists in the mind. One perceives that there is an "I" and there are "other" objects (e.g. deities, demons, people etc). But one is able to focus the mind intensely on one object (e.g. a deity) and able to achieve oneness with that object. Even reaching savikalpa samadhi is a tremendous thing and many great yogis also cannot go beyond savikalpa samadhi.
 
In nirvikalpa samadhi, the creational variety and objectification ceases (nirvikalpa=nir+vikalpa, nir=devoid of). Mind reaches a state where there is no perception of I and "other" objects. One's consciousness is absorbed in supreme consciousness (Brahman or Aatman), without any perception of a variety of objects. This state is reached by very very few yogis.
 
Sahaja samadhi is a state where the mind is *simultaneously* perceiving a variety of objects *and* absorbed in the supreme consciousness!
 
*        *        *
 
When one is normally perceiving a variety objects, one's mind is absorbed in an *individualized* consciousness that is colored with the conditioning of that individual's experiences over various lives. When one sees a beautiful person, one's mind may get certain thoughts (depending on the experiences, values and desires accumulated from many lives). When somebody is praising one, one's mind may get certain thoughts. When somebody is criticizing one, one's mind may get certain thoughts. And so on. One's mind has likes, dislikes, attractions, repulsions etc, based on the accumulated experiences, values and desires of that individualized consciousness.
 
In sahaja samadhi, one has no individualized consciousness and one's mind is absorbed in the infinite supreme consciousness that is not colored by the experiences and conditioning of a single individual. One is actively living in the material world; one's mind is perceiving various objects of various attributes through jnanendriyas; and, one's mind is engaging in various actions in the material world though karmendriyas. Yet, one has no individualized conditioning or I-ness.
 
Very very very few beings, mostly re-incarnations of rishis and gods, can reach that state. For most others, that state is not really a possibility.
 
*        *        *
 
I gave an analogy earlier to explain various aspects of consciousness, using parts of a computer.
 
ahamkaara (I-ness) - CPU
chitta (conditioning) - DRAM
buddhi - ALU or logic coprocessor
manas - I/O controller
jnanendriyas - input channels
karmendriyas - output channels
praanas - on-board power supply
deha (body) - mechanical parts, chassis etc
 
Normally, CPU is running a complex program where a lot of input channels and output channels are active. DRAM has a lot of stored data and CPU is refreshing it frequently. ALU is running several algorithms based on stored data and a lot of I/O data gets stored/retrieved from DRAM all the time. This is analogous to a person's normal state.
 
Nirvikalpa samadhi is like a state where the computer is in a power standby. On-board power supply is hardly supplying any power, all input and output channels are turned off, I/O controller is turned off and ALU is not running any algorithms. If a computer goes into power standy and exits it quickly, it will resume what it was doing before. Similarly, a person reaching nirvikalpa samadhi and leaving it quickly will resume previous activities. If a computer stays in the power standby for too long, it will be turned off and its state may be lost, i.e. it cannot resume. If one stays in nirvikalpa samadhi for too long, one will simply merge in Brahman and cannot resume previous activities.
 
Sahaja samadhi is akin to a computer running a bare minimum program that accesses a program running on a central super computer on a network. CPU, ALU, memory etc are running on a central super computer and our individual computer's CPU simply has a small routine that accesses the results of the algorithm running on the super computer and controls the local I/O controller accordingly. There isn't much data stored locally and there is no algorithm running locally. One's praanas are supplying power, one's jnanendriyas are getting inputs and one's karmendriyas are engaging in actions, one's manas is controlling this Input/Ouput activity and ahamkara (CPU) is controlling all this by running a small program that accesses a super computer that is monitoring all the computers of the world and deciding what this computer should do.
 
*        *        *
 
As I said, very very very few beings can reach sahaja samadhi and it is beyond the reach of even the greatest yogis. As I said, most yogis cannot even reach nirvikalpa samadhi. Some reach nirvikalpa samadhi, come back to regular consciousness after a while and start to accumulate conditioning again (chitta, i.e. DRAM). The CPU is running some program or the other, however small, and accumulating more data in DRAM and building up an algorithm in ALU. Minimization of I-ness is possible, but elimination of I-ness while embodied is very difficult! If any limited I-ness is left and any conditioning (I am this, I need this, I like this etc) is left, then it is NOT sahaja samadhi. Sahaja samadhi is a lack of limited individual I-ness and connecting the supreme universal I-ness directly to one's mind and body.
 
I cannot make judgments on individual claims, as it is none of my business. I will take on individuals only when they interfere with my dharma and my sense of dharma dictates that I should take them on.
 
But the bottomline is that sahaja samadhi state is no joke and only yogis of an absolutely tremendous caliber reach it. Those who reach this state are like the god - supreme cosmic being - himself.
 
*        *        *
 
Let me give another analogy. This life is like a long dream. Saviklapa samadhi is like wakig up *within* the dream. Nirvikalpa samadhi is like waking up from the dream. Sahaja samadhi is like being in the dream and yet being awake.
 
This may confuse people, but this analogy shows how complex and difficult sahaja samadhi is. The previous computer analogy highlights how things work in a sahaja samadhi, but does not show why and how difficult it is.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
