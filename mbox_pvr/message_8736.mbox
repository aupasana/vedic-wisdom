Namaste friends,
=A0
Regarding speed:
=A0
To one practicing to walk on a ti=
ght rope, focus and steadiness are more important than speed. If one walks =
too fast, one will fall. Similarly, to one seeking to walk on the tight rop=
e of enlightened/detached action, focus and steadiness are far more importa=
nt than speed. If one walks too fast, one will fall (develop attachment to =
actions or fruits).
=A0
Spiritual progress by definition is the process of =
slowing down unneeded mental activity and focus on one's dharma with as lit=
tle attachment as possible. The notion of making "fast" spiritual progress =
introduces unneeded mental activity and spoils focus.
=A0
A somewhat relate=
d point:
=A0
Don't make the sadhana you do into a rat race or even a mindle=
ss ritual. Try to make it enjoyable. Try to put your mind into it. If neces=
sary, cut down on aspects that are stopping you from being mindful and enjo=
ying it.
=A0
Regarding experiences:
=A0
> In a nutshell, a genuine "experie=
nce" is good and authentic only to the extent
> that it helps to modify and=
 transform your waking surface personality.
=A0
Absolutely. I will quote fr=
om http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/7948:
=A0
<QUOTE BEGI=
N>
Suppose I go into the open, but see Sun through green eyeglasses. I will=
 see that Sun is green. I am experiencing the real Sun, but I will get the =
wrong knowledge that "Sun is green".
=A0
Similarly, even a genuine spiritua=
l experience (e.g. seeing Sun!) CAN generate false knowledge (e.g. Sun is g=
reen!) if one's conditioning is conducive (e.g. green eyeglasses!).
=A0
The=
 key is not just to experience, but the ability to interpet, *digest* and a=
bsorb the experience into one's system well. One's conditioning influences =
how one digests various life experiences, including spiritual experiences a=
nd mystical experiences, like the green eye glasses in the above example!

=A0
Yes, seekers will do well to remember these words. One may not re=
alize the importance of this today, but a day will come for every seeker wh=
en this will make all the difference in the world.
=A0
If one has a good gu=
ru, (s)he will arrest the destruction. The main purpose of a guru is to det=
ect inflations in ego and cut them off. However, many people are kind of on=
 their own in this age. That is why I keep emphasizing this point on hangin=
g on tight to the fundamentals.

A sage "sms" indeed! Yes direction must be always, always the top mos=
