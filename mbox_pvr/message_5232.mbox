Namaste,
 
While appreciating your viewpoint, I want to add my 2 cents of a perspective.
 
*        *        *
 
Vishnu's incarnations such as Rama and Krishna worshipped Shiva. Shiva and Vishnu had unconditional love and devotion for each other. They are not like normal human beings and their relationships, such as love and devotion, are not governed by petty notions of superiority and dependence.
 
The Shaivite-Vaishnavite distinctions and the biases of Kali yuga are unfortunate. Nevertheless, I am willing to tolerate biases and closed-mindedness. Closed-mindedness is ok as long as one is making some progress with one's own belief system.
 
*        *        *
 
One climbing a mountain has to choose one of the available paths. Whether one acknowledges that several mountain paths lead to the mountain top or whether one believes that only the path one has chosen leads to the top, is not that important. As long as one is climbing the mountain in one's chosen path, one is doing alright!
 
After all, there may be many paths around the hill. One may be unable to see paths on the other side of the mountain or even distant paths on the same side. If one does not think much of those paths and focuses on climbing in one's own path, that does no harm.
 
As one reaches the top, it gets narrower and one may see the other paths that seemed quite distant earlier to be quite nearby now. As one is very close to the top, one will see that all paths are leading there. When one is on the top, one sees all paths to converge there. After god-realization, one sees various paths to be valid paths to god. Of course, different paths come with different obstacles. One path may have some snow. One path may be too steep. One path may be slippery. One path may have falling rocks. One path may have fallen trees blocking it. And so on. But, one on the top knows that people can reach there using several paths, if they are committed to overcoming the obstacles and reaching the top.
 
Let people follow the paths chosen by them and wish them good luck to reach the top in their own paths. Let them say whatever they want to say about your path. It does not matter. If YOU have conviction and faith, you just walk your path and reach the top!
 
*        *        *
 
The problem is that some people are doing no sadhana really, making no progress really and yet passing judgments on other paths and getting into fights. They are like people at the base of the mountain, trying to block people from some paths and trying to enroll them in their path. They may fight with people and kill them too. They stay at the base forever and never reach the top. They are a problem.
 
But, people with narrow views who do some sadhana and make progress are ok. They are on some path and will eventually reach god. For example, so many Krishna bhaktas who look down upon Shiva as a lower demigod may be doing their mantra several malas a day with a good level of devotion and they will eventually make progress. I know Vaishnavas in some sampradayas who do not even worship Ganesha as he is "from Shiva's family" and worship Vishvaksena at the start of their poojas instead of Ganesha. But, they do no harm to anyone, try to see all human beings as Vishnu's forms, try to serve all and keep their austerities. Bottomline is that they are doing some sadhana and will eventually make progress.
 
Let us not worry about people who are doing some sadhana and progressing. Any deficiencies in their understanding will be addressed in due course.
 
The bottomline is: Keep doing enough sadhana to burn the conditioning and keep making progress.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

> I hardly disagree with your views but for Iskcon I have my own thoughts,no doubt on Shri Prabhupada and his mission to spread Shri Krishna's awareness but many times(After exit of Shri Prabhupada)on numerous occasions I found their views very biased towards Shri Shivji and for that reason I have my reservations and those views of mine are not my own views as some senior ex-Iskconites too share same views like me.If I am allowed to speak I have seen very few shivites speaking hard stuff like them for opposite side.(Shri Hari or Shri Krishna),not even that well known astrologer Sanjay Rath once posted a separate procedures for Vaishnavas to do Mahamrityunjaya japam using Shri Veda Vyasa's name instead of Shri Vasishtha mantra(Vam Vasishthaya Namah) ! Sometimes people forget what Shri Veda Vyasa and Shri Vasishtha did for hindu religion and here they use "Human Brain"to separate two sampradayas.

If you read thousands of books on an elephant without having ever seen one, you may still not be able imagine an elephant. Moreover, you may find different books to be contradictory. You may like some and dislike some based on your own biases about what an elephant looks like. If you see an elephant yourself oneday, you will realize then that books that seemed contradictory once are not that contradictory after all.

To go abroad without even knowing anyone there at an advanced age to spread Krishna bhakti, to roam New York streets without proper shoes or clothing in winter, requires tremendous surrender. Based on previous samskaras, some may not be attracted to his interpretations. But that does not take away anything from them.

> Sophisticated and complicated Upanishadic ideas are not palatable to everyone. They need to be simplified. Especially, people from monotheistic belief systems and subscription based religions need simpler models of divinity. So Upanishads and scriptures need to be interpreted so as to be palatable to them. So many great saints came and interpreted scriptures slightly differently, because there are different groups of people with different samkaras waiting to be guided by them.

If you read the telugu version, can you please clarify if those points are covered in telugu also somewhere? The language is quite complex by today's standards (even in telugu), so I always have this doubt if I am reading it enough and interpreting right? But I keep trying to read as I love that poetry by the great poet Potana.

When one does rituals and other spiritual sadhana, the deities throw away some bad fruits into a trash can and make one eat good fruits earlier than otherwise. But there may be some spillage as dirty fruits are thrown away. If a priest is conducting the ritual, he may be affected by the spillage.

One's aptitude, attitude and actions have to be brahmana-like. Many brahmanas today think of power and influence over others or of money or of comforts. They are not thinking just of knowledge and liberation. They are not really brahmanas. In fact, there are very very few brahmanas on earth right now. Shastras are clear that rituals can be performed for others only by brahmanas. What it means is that one desirous of power, influence, money and comforts is unfit to perform rituals for others.

Moreover, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahmana by overcoming the tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas.

If an astrologer's action of giving advice to someone resulted in that person doing X instead of Y at kaarmik crossroads and experiencing Z instead of W in coming years, there is clearly an action here. If the astrologer has some sense of "I am doing this", then one is bound to experience the fruits of it. Some blessings can come and some sufferings can come too.

Again, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahmana by overcoming tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas. Irrespective of where one was born and brought up, one will become a brahmana if one follows this. Only brahmanas are qualified to play with the karmas of others by giving life-altering advice or by conducting rituals. Again, to be clear, I am not talking about brahmanas by birth, but about brahmanas by conduct.
