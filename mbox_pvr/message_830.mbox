To me, the ideal pooja room is a clean and pure=
 heart. Ideal pooja room is a heart that has no malice for anyone and no eg=
o/pride. Ideal pooja room is a heart that does not feel proud when others p=
raise one and does not feel bad when others abuse one. Ideal pooja room is =
a heart in which one's favorite deity is established firmly. Ideal pooja ro=
om is a heart that is peaceful and views everything and everyone with an eq=
ual vision, as a manifestation of one's favorite deity. Ideal pooja pooja r=
oom is a heart that does not feel great attraction or great aversion toward=
s anything or anyone. Ideal pooja room is a heart that can engage in variou=
s kinds of actions without emotions normally associated those actions linge=
ring in it.
 
The purpose of a physical pooja room is to create an ideal po=
oja room as described above in one's heart. Exactly which articles and prac=
tices in the physical pooja room mould one's thinking to create the ideal p=
ooja room described above in one's heart depends on who one is, what one's =
karmas and rinas are and how one's mind is conditioned currently. A particu=
lar photo of a deity and meditation in front of it may cultivate that spiri=
t in one person after enough time. A particular idol of a deity and bathing=
 of it everyday may cultivate that spirit in one person after enough time. =
One should use the articles and practices that appeal to one and that are s=
uggested by one's gurus and elders. But the bottomline is that the ideal po=
oja room exists only in one's heart and one should never forget it. Choices=
t photos, idols, pooja articles and rituals in the physical pooja room are =
useless when one's heart is impure. Use a physical pooja room to create the=
 ideal pooja room in your heart.
 
*        *        *
 
I would like to qu=
ote some portions from the book "Vasishtha's Yoga" by Swami Venkatesananda.=
 This is a translation of "Yoga Vaasishtham". Here Lord Siva teaches Mahars=
hi Vasishtha how to worship the supreme lord of the universe.
 
"It is he i=
ndeed who is worshipped by wise men in various ways and in various forms su=
ch as Siva, Vishnu, etc. Now listen to the ways in which he is to be worshi=
pped.
 
"First of all, one should abandon the body-idea (the notion that 'I=
 am this body'). Meditation alone is true worship. Hence one should constan=
tly worship the Lord of the three worlds by means of meditation. How should=
 one contemplate him? He is pure intelligence, he is as radiant as a thousa=
nd suns risen together, he is the light that illumines all lights, he is th=
e inner light, the limitless space is his throat, the firmament is his feet=
, the directions are his arms, the worlds are the weapons he bears in his h=
ands, the entire universe is hidden in his heart, the gods are hairs on his=
 body, the cosmic potencies are energies in his body, time is his gate-keep=
er and he has thousands of heads, eyes, ears and arms. He touches all, tast=
es all, he hears all, he thinks through all though he is beyond thiniking. =
He does everything at all times, he bestows whatever one thinks of or desir=
es, he dwells in all, he is the all, he alone is to be sought by all. Thus =
should one contemplate him.
 
"The Lord is not to be worshipped by material=
 substances but by one's own consciousness. Not be waving of lamps nor ligh=
ting incense, nor by offering flowers nor even by offering food or sandalpa=
ste. He is worshipped by self-realisation alone. This is the supreme medita=
tion, this is the supreme worship: the continuous and unbroken awareness of=
 the indwelling presence, inner light or consciousness. While doing whateve=
r one is doing - seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, moving, sleep=
ing, breathing or talking - one should realize one's essential nature as pu=
re consciousness.
 
"One should contemplate that the Lord is the intelligen=
ce in the body. The various functions and faculties in the body serve that =
intelligence as consorts serve their lord. The mind is the messenger who br=
ings and presents to the Lord the knowledge of the three worlds. The two fu=
ndamental energies, viz., the energy of wisdom (jnaana sakti) and the energ=
y of action (kriyaa sakti), are the consorts of the Lord. Diverse aspects o=
f knowledge are his ornaments.  The organs of action are the gates through =
which the Lord enters the outside world.
 
"He who contemplates in this man=
ner is equanimity itself, his behavior is equanimous, guided by equal visio=
n. He has reached the state of natural goodness and inner purity and he is =
beautiful in every aspect of his being. He worships the Lord who is the int=
elligence that pervades his entire body.
 
" The worship is performed day a=
nd night perpetually, with the objects that are effortlessly obtained, and =
are offered to the Lord with a mind firmless established in equanimity and =
in the right spirit. The Lord should be worshipped with everything that is =
obtained without effort. One should never make the least effort to obtain t=
hat which one does not possess. The Lord should be worshipped by means of a=
ll the enjoyments that the body enjoys, through eating, drinking, being wit=
h one's consort and such other pleasures. The Lord should be worshipped wit=
h the illnesses one experiences and with every sort of unhappiness or suffe=
ring one experiences. The Lord should be worshipped with all of one's activ=
ities, including life and death and all of one's dreams. The Lord should be=
 worshipped with one's poverty and prosperity. The Lord should be worshippe=
d even with fights and quarrels as well as woth sports and other passtimes,=
 and with manifestation of emotions of attraction and aversion. The Lord sh=
ould be adored with the noble qualities of a pious heart - friendship, comp=
assion, joy and indifference.
 
"The Lord should be worshipped with all kin=
ds of pleasures that are granted to one unsought, whether those pleasures a=
re sanctioned by the scriptures, etc., or forbidden by them. The Lord shoul=
d be worshipped with those which are regarded as desirable and others which=
 are regarded as undesirable, with those that are considered appropriate an=
d others that are considered inappropriate. For this worship, one should ab=
andon what is lost and one should accept and receive what has been obtained=
 without effort."
 
*        *        *
 
The above is the ideal pooja reco=
mmended by Lord Siva to Maharshi Vasishtha. To reach the mental state requi=
red for this pooja, one may have to perform other poojas and rituals that r=
equire conscious effort to do some things and avoid some other things. But =
the end goal is the reach the state of equanimity described above by Lord S=
iva.

Narasimha
