Namaste,

In some quarters, there is a view that only abhishekam (bathing) is 
advisable for Rudra and not homam (fire worship). They think that Rudra is 
full of fire and fire worship increases the fire and bathing cools down the 
fire.

However, any deity can be called in fire, even fiery deities. There is no 
harm in calling a fiery planet like Mars or Sun in fire and doing homam with 
their mantras, as suggested by Maharshi Parasara (father of Vyasa). Also, 
Rudra homam is done at many temples. Traditionally, homam is done with 
1/10th of the count of Rudrabhishekam.

Rudra is like a bowman who releases the fruits of your karmas like an arrow. 
Homam really accelerates this. Moreover, Rudra namakam is a long veda mantra 
and it is nearly impossible for most of us to pronounce it correctly. Just 
like Chandi homam, one should do Rudra homam if one is surrendered to the 
Lord and prepared to face the music for ANY karmas done before and be done 
with them. Of course, after a few painful blocking karmas are gotten over 
with, one can make tremendous spiritual progress. But, if one wants to go 
slowly, I suggest that Chandi homam and Rudra homam are not for that person.

I wanted to distribute a manual for a Shiva homam with simple Shiva mantras. 
But, somehow, the inspiration from inside has not come yet and it has not 
happened.

Best regards,
Narasimha
