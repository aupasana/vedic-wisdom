Namaste,

For anybody, doing Ganapathi homam on a regular basis for several months 
will open the path. Spending half hour in front of fire is as good as 
spending 3-4 hours in meditation or other rituals.

Also, rituals work when done on a regular basis and with feeling.

If you do Ganapathi homam on a regular basis for 6 months, you should find 
the right guidance regarding the next step. Leave it to Ganapathi. He is 
better than all astrologers.

Best regards,
Narasimha
