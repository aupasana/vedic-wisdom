Dear Rajarshi,
=C2=A0
"Devil" is quite resourceful these days, even without=
 a learned "advocate" like you! ;-)
=C2=A0
Yes, you are fundamentally corre=
ct - in the end, rituals are filled with symbols and repeated mental associ=
ations result in external actions/factors resonating internally in particul=
ar ways. Rituals are indeed mind games geared towards eventually evolving a=
 useful mental reality.

=C2=A0
At the same time, things are not completely=
 arbitrary either, i.e. the symbols are not just empty symbols. There is so=
me basic structure to things. The process of evolving our mental reality is=
 not 100% under our control and needs to obey some basic cosmic laws, many =
of which may not yet be apparent to our limited minds.=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =
*
=C2=A0
Yes, water and air may be symbols of divinity too, but fire IS dif=
ferent. Continued visualization of divine presence in water or air, though =
possible, requires far more effort from us than in fire. Anyone meditating =
in front of homam fire should know it.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
There =
is a story in Mahabharata. When Indra gets the terrible sin of Brahma hatya=
 (killing a knower of Self) for killing Vritra, Brahma asks him to share it=
 with some other deities who will then distribute it among people when they=
 do certain bad acts. Among those distributors is Agni. Agni was asked to p=
ass on parts of his portion of the sin to people whose offerings in a fire =
ritual are unburnt and flames go off.
=C2=A0
If there are still flames, it =
means there are offerings that can burn further. If one extinguishes the fl=
ames, one theoretically gets a part of the sin of Brahma hatya. :-(
=C2=A0
=
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Of course, this makes some intuitive sense. If I am a=
ble to perceive various divine entities within myself, I don't need fire ri=
tual. Because I am unable to do so, I am taking help from Agni, the "origin=
al Priest" of Veda, and seeking his help to allow me to perceive various di=
vine entities in Him. This priest obliges anybody who seeks such help witho=
ut asking questions or charging any fee and the least you can do is to let =
him eat in peace what you yourself served him in the first place and allow =
him to leave by Himself! If you "kill" the priest who facilitated your wors=
hip by summoning deities within him, of course it makes sense why it should=
 be akin to "Brahma hatya"..
=C2=A0
BTW, if you extinguished homam fire for=
cefully before, don't worry too much. Agni distributes his portion of the B=
rahma hatya sin among so many that it's quite diluted. We anyway do commit =
so many sins. Nevertheless, don't knowingly do it anymore, for things can a=
dd up.
=C2=A0
Bottomline: As most of you know, I am quite a liberal guy whe=
n it comes to orthodoxy in rituals. However, IMHO, extinguishing homam fire=
 forcefully is a serious matter and avoidable. Please try to avoid it. At l=
east, don't teach others that it's ok.

=C2=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

>In
 my view, whatever little I have understo=

 sense, depending on 
the person who is using the symbol, it will or will n=

very creative, imaginative and pure soul can use anythi=

 anything, because the actual process of activating a sym=

within.

>The process of using symbols in any ritual is to c=

 particular conditioning of the mind to help it to remove some othe=

 one keeps doing fire rituals from day one=
 with the belief that by

 mental 
association.

>OTOH, a yogi who is conditioned to see fire as a 
=
living entity and a symbol of the Higher Consciousness, would never like
 t=
o torture the fire or force it into doing something that is violent in
 nat=
ure. The thing with pouring water or extinguishing a fire is that it
 evoke=
s a sense of violence and torture *inside* the seeker, *specially*
 if s/he=
 has learnt to connect the fire to his consciousness. That is 
the seekers =
way of connecting.=C2=A0 And a way of connecting is build by 
endless repea=
tations.

nally over time. Initially when a person does a homa

 my view, whatever little I have understood in the last 5/6 years, a

the person w=

 evokes a sen=
