Dear Narsimhaji, I was thinking yesterday to ask about Nyasas and today I s=
aw your this mail mentioning Nyasas. Will you please elaborately explain ab=
out Nyasas. Whether this is necessary? What actually we have to think while=
 doing Nyasas? Kindly guide because so far I know these all are simply ritu=
als.

Namaste,
=C2=
=A0
There are 11 days instead of 10 from Pratipada to Vijaya Dasami this ti=
me. If you look at the nights before Vijaya Dasami, then there are ten nigh=
ts instead of nine this year. This happens sometimes.
=C2=A0
If you live on=
 US east coast, then Chaturthi comes twices on Thursday and Friday (Oct 2 &=
 3). It lasted the entire Thursday and extended into Friday. Panchami was o=
n Saturday (Oct 4). Shashthi was on Sunday (Oct 5). Ashtami is on Tuesday (=
Oct 8). Navami is on Wednesday (Oct 9). Dasami is on Thursday (Oct 10).
=C2=
=A0
If one's parents did not do a proper "anna praasana" ritual (the ritual=
 of first feeding of solid food to a baby) to one, should one consider ones=
elf not entitled to eat any solid food? Not doing a mantra because of no in=
itiation is basically like that.
=C2=A0
Getting initiation is good, especia=
lly if the one initiating has some level of sadhana in that mantra. But it =
is neither necessary nor sufficient for making progress in your own sadhana=
.
=C2=A0
If you see my homam document, I gave an analogy for this. A millio=
naire may open a bank account in his son's name with a starting balance of =
a million dollars. This is akin to a good guru initiating a sishya in a man=
tra. Sishya starts off by getting some of guru's attainment. But the son ma=
y waste those million dollars and end up with nothing. Similarly the sishya=
 may fall and not achieve anything. Another person may not have anyone to g=
ive money and may start off with a zero bank balance but accumulate million=
s of dollars with own effort. This is akin to=C2=A0a person doing sadhana w=
ith a mantra without guru and attaining some level in the mantra.
=C2=A0
So=
me people hold the view that mantras cannot be chanted without a proper "in=
itiation" . This view is especially prevalent in some sections of society w=
.r.t. navarna mantra. However, I disagree with that view.
=C2=A0
If you kno=
w the mantra (!), just chant it. What would an initiating guru have done fo=
r you? Perhaps he would've given some of his attainment in the mantra to yo=
u. Well, you can do it yourself if you work hard. Or a guru would've taught=
 you the right nyasas to be done before the mantra. Well, you can get the n=
yasas from books too. Moreover, what most people do today for nyasas is any=
way just a ritual with no meaning. Nyasa literally means placement. You pla=
ce various sounds in various body parts (like the tips of various fingers, =
heart, top of head, eyes etc). People merely act out some signals while say=
ing the sounds. This "placement" is actually supposed to be an internal act=
 and it creates an ideal environment for the repetition of mantra. Due to t=
he external actions, what is supposed to occur internally does not occur in=
 most. So the sounds end up not getting properly placed in the body. In oth=
er words, what I am trying to say is that most people do
 not know how to "=
place" various "sounds" in various body parts. They merely perform meaningl=
ess ritualistic actions. So, if you do not know nyasas, you are not really =
missing much compared to others who were initiated.
=C2=A0
In my humble opi=
nion, the most important qualification is to have devotion and sense of sur=
render to Her. If you have them, you can consider yourself "highly initiate=
d".
=C2=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

Dear N=
arasimha,

When does Navratri end? It started on last Monday, September 29,=
 2008 and should therefore end on Tuesday, October 7, 2008 (Nine Nights)...=
yet the panchang shows that at sunrise on Wednesday, October 8 starts with =
Navami, so should we continue our Navratri on Wednesday too even though it =
is technically the 10th day? (All these times are based on US EST)..

Also,=
 can anyone do the Navarna mantra, "Om Aim Hrim Klim Chamundayai Vicche" or=
 does this require initiation?

Thanks,
Chandraprakash
