Dear Sir,
Would it not be of immense help to the ordinary person whose know=
ledge of Sanskrit is limited not only to "understand" what he says but also=
 take more interest, enjoyment, and truly get immersed in what he is reciti=
ng/ reading?
I think this is the reason for the great saints like Sant Dnya=
neshwar to compose the Bhaavarth Deepika in Marathi.
But I agree with you t=
hat the sacred stotras should be recited in sanskrit...=C2=A0

      Namaste friends,

 

I will give my 2 cents on a few p=
oints.

 

*        *        *

 

I once wanted to translate Devi Saptasha=
ti into my mother tongue Telugu in poetic form, so that Telugu people who f=
ind Saptashati too complicated to read or feel uncomfortable because they d=
o not know the meaning, can read the Telugu version instead. When I floated=
 the idea, Manish discouraged me. He asked me, "who do you think you are?" =
He said that it could be considered later, but firmly told me to drop the i=
dea for then.

 

Please note that the goal of sadhana, such as homam, medi=
tation, chanting mantras and prayers, is NOT just an intellectual understan=
ding of what they mean. They are tools to silence the mind and channel its =
energy. They are storehouses of some shakti left by rishis, yogis and sadha=
kas, who used them in the past.

 

An intellectual understanding may help =
facilitate the right mood, right frame of mind and right imagery. But, even=
 without it, a mantra that was used by great sadhakas, yogis and rishis hol=
ds power.

 

In fact, the words of a rishi that one cannot intellectually =
understand can be more effective for spiritual progress, than the words of =
a normal person that one can intellectually understand and appreciate. So, =
I suggest not worrying about whether one understands or not and reading San=
skrit mantras coming from great rishis/yogis/sadhakas.

 

*        *      =
  *

 

If I were to give an analogy in terms of playing cricket, a batsman=
 may read a lot of scholarly analysis on how to play shots, how to see the =
ball from the hand of the bowler, how to move feet, how get into the line o=
f the ball, how to play it with a straight bat, when to play front foot and=
 when to play back foot etc. But that does not necessarily make one a good =
batsman. If one practices, THAT can make one a good player. Of course, some=
 basic understanding of principles is needed. But, above that, practice is =
more important than bookish knowledge.

 

Similarly, some conceptual under=
standing is important in spirituality also, but above that, sadhana is more=
 important.

 

The essence of all scriptures, all mantras, all sadhanas, a=
ll paths is very simple. It is that we should overcome the notions that we =
are doing things and realize that the divine acts through all of us. The di=
vine acts through each being based on one's conditioning and gives correspo=
nding reactions. One goes through the cycle until one overcomes the notions=
 of "I am doing", "this is mine", "I like this and I dislike that" etc. Tho=
ugh this is the essence of all scriptures and one knows it, one may be delu=
ded again and again. There is no magic formula to internalize this understa=
nding fully and overcome the instincts of "I am doing", "this is mine" etc.=


 

So, even if one practices a mantra that one does not intellectually un=
derstand, that is ok. As long as the basic essence of scriptures is at the =
back of one's mind, one is constantly contemplating and watching over one's=
 own thoughts and instincts, to root out undesirable thoughts, one's sadhan=
a will yield results.

 

*        *        *

 

This is why I keep repeat=
ing the need of sadhana. It is fine to read scriptures and other books. It =
is fine to meet spiritual people (physically or virtually, like here) and d=
iscuss good things. But that will only create a theoretical understanding. =
For it to be internalized and to govern all of one's instincts, thoughts an=
d actions, one needs to do sadhana.

 

One doing sadhana without a basic t=
heoretical understanding of what is what and what we want, is like a blind =
person running around a mountain, instead of climbing it. One not doing sad=
hana, but having an excellent theoretical understanfing, is like a person w=
ho knows that he needs to climb the mountain, but keeps staring at the pinn=
acle instead of climbing it.

 

*        *        *

 

Regarding the stat=
ement that initiation is important in tantric path but not in Vedic path, I=
 want to add my 2 cents.

 

Whether Vedic and tantrik paths are two *disti=
nct* paths or parts of a continuum is debatable. There are a lot of inaccur=
ate notions today.

 

The issue is not really Tantrik vs Vedic. The issue =
is one's attitude and what one wants. Anybody who wants specific material r=
esults needs to be careful regarding how to go about it. Re-arrangement of =
karmas to affect a particular result is not easy. It requires supervision o=
f a good guru and not many are left anyway. On the other hand, if one is NO=
T looking for specific material results and is looking for spiritual progre=
ss, the constraints are fewer and options more.

 

Some may sub-consciousl=
y have a notion that Tantrik path is for begetting specific material result=
s and Vedic path is for self-realization. That is incorrect. After all, one=
 in the Vedic path may chant Manyu sooktam for victory in litigation or Ayu=
shya sooktam for longevity, and so on. Similarly, one in the Tantrik path m=
ay eat a gross substance in an elaborate ritual to reinforce the notion tha=
t "all is Brahman" and to remove the mental repulsion towards some objects.=


 

*        *        *

 

My thumbrule is this. If you are looking for a=
 specific material result, you need clear guidance and supervision, which n=
ot many are capable of giving today! Instead, if you want spiritual progres=
s and an increase of your surrender, you can just keep doing sadhana withou=
t initiation or guidance. Just keep company of scriptures and other like-mi=
nded people.

 

After all, if you want to go to Calcutta, you need clear a=
nd precise directions and some supervision. If you just want to go to north=
 pole, you can keep walking towards north. Of course, having supervision he=
lps there too, but you can do without it!

 

Best regards,

Narasimha

rding the necessity of initiation. I will address it after summarizing the =
big picture that needs to be invoked in order to understand the ONE questio=
n and the MANY answers possible. Firstly is the question a general or speci=
fic one? Generally speaking if the question is whether initiation is an abs=
olute requirement for spiritual life or sadhana, *my* answer is- NO. Howeve=
r if the question is about the necessity of being initiated for mantra sadh=
ana as enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the answer is =C3=82?YES.

> > > 

> > >=
 'Munde munde matir bhinna' as the tantric adage goes; thereby the necessit=
y for multiple approaches and multiple paths. Thus arises the inevitability=
 of multiple perspectives. In the pan-Indian context there are many paths f=
or sadhana. But in the current context of this question I will restrict mys=
elf to only the five that are relevant to the discussion.

> > > 

> > > a.=
 Gnana marga (Advaitic/Vedantic)

> > > b. Yoga marga (Psycho-spiritual)

>=
 > > c. Mantra marga (Tantric)

> > > d. Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion)

> > =
> e. Karma marga (Action- Ritual path and/or Selfless Actions)

> > > 

> >=
 > Spiritual life is nothing but the practicalisation of the great abstract=
 Truths of the Cosmos. Each of the above paths EMPHASISES particular method=
s and techniques in its attempt to practicalise the abstract truths at an e=
xperiential level. Let us briefly look at the predominant methods/ techniqu=
es employed by each of these paths.

> > > For those who are predominantly =
oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking even the external guru is not =
necessary, though one can greatly benefit from the wisdom and experience of=
 a genuine teacher. The direct path of Advaita emphasises the methods of Vi=
veka (Discernment) and Vichara (self-reflection). Advaita being essentially=
 a culmination of the Vaidik system it has retained the vaidik practice of =
'Swadhyaya' (regular self-study of texts) too as an important practice. All=
 of these practices involve the 'self' in a big way with a marginal role fo=
r external practices.

> > > 

> > > Yoga marga emphasises Abhyasa (self-co=
aching by consistent practice) and Vairagya (Non-reactivity or Non-attachme=
nt). Hindu schools of Yoga additionally emphasise 'Iswarapranidhana' (orien=
ting oneself towards the Supreme Iswara) too while Bauddha and Jina schools=
 of Yogamarga emphasise only the first two as they subscribe to nirishwarav=
ada.

> > > 

> > > Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion) emphasises unconditional a=
cceptance of Iswara's will through total surrender to the Supreme. On the c=
ontrary the emphasis in Karma marga is on Action as advocated by the Bhagav=
ad Gita. Engaging in actions without attachment to the results is the mains=
tay of Karma marga of the Gita.

> > > 

> > > Finally I will address the T=
antric path of mantra sadhana where alone the inevitable necessity of initi=
ation and thereby the necessity of a Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves t=
he practicalization of certain occult truths via the energetics of Sabda th=
rough the employment of Vak. It presupposes certain dangers inherent to any=
 lab experiment and thereby certain regulations and safe practices. It shou=
ld be remembered that except Bhakti marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at=
 various levels, while Bhakti predominantly invokes Soma (the reference her=
e is to the age-old `Agni-Someeyam'). Among the paths that invoke Agni, one=
 path invokes/employs the fire of the intellect, another the fire of speech=
, another the fire of austerity, and yet another the physical fire of the Y=
agnya and so on.

> > > 

> > > Tantra's method of invoking fire deals with=
 the fire of Vak through the lab-like practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra =
employs highly powerful techniques that bring results more quickly it lays =
great emphasis on adhikara. Adhikara is not about authority but more about =
qualification. Would you allow a child to experiment with fire without any =
supervision? Does the supervisor need experience and training or not? Like =
any other lab experiment proper training and experience are part of the pro=
cedure apart from certain safety measures, in the Tantric lab experiment to=
o.  However the lab is one's own consciousness whilst the experiment is awa=
kening the Sakti within the individual consciousness (also referred to as K=
undalini Sakti). As this is not a topic for mere intellectualisation, I wil=
l refrain from further discussion on the Kundalini. Without going into othe=
r needless details here, I will just elaborate on initiation and Guru param=
para.

> > > 

> > > Since we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to =
contextualise it within the larger Tantric context too. Sakti sadhana is on=
e major river within the Tantric context. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the e=
ntire Sakta sadhanas comprehensively. However there are actually three majo=
r schools that are full-fledged living traditions among the DashaMahaVidyas=
- Kalikula, Srikula and Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kalikul=
a whilst Sri Vidya  sadhana belongs to Srikula. Just to make the picture mo=
re complete the Vajrayanas among the Buddhists (!) have taken to Tarakula. =
To those who are familiar with Tibetan Buddhism I will draw attention to th=
e the 21 forms of Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana shares both the Advaitic outlook=
 as well as the Sakta sadhanas in its approach to sadhana.

> > > 

> > > K=
ali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma is not invoked at all)=
 while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, at least at the major milestone=
s in the internal spiritual journey. The yantra, mantra, bija, devata, etc =
are all consistently of a particular set of synchronistic frequencies for e=
ach of these three lineages. Initiation is the full-fledged entry of the pr=
actitioner into a particular spiritual lineage of that path (kula). The Gur=
u parampara can be compared to an INVERTED TREE with SIVA himself at the ro=
ot from where the trunk arises. Each branch and sub-branches and twigs spre=
ad out progressively downward till the individual sadhaka.  It is a beautif=
ul metaphor if you can visualise it. Another modern metaphor that one can u=
se is that of electricity. It is held by the Tantric advocate that initiati=
on not only completes the circuit necessary for the conduit of electricity =
but also prevents short circuit. Imagine many beautiful
 bulbs/lights at ea=
ch point in this inverted tree of live wires, where there is a long series =
of sadhakas sitting in silent practice all the way up till Siva himself.  I=
t is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) and Sound (Sabda). Now back to Sri =
Sri Chandi.

> > > 

> > > As already stated Sakta sadhana seeks to awaken =
Sakti within the individual consciousness through an integrated approach th=
at combines the practices of Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and Mantra. Both Ka=
likula and Srikula have evolved into highly comprehensive and integrated ap=
proaches that can simultaneously hold the many in the One. Sri Sri Chandi s=
eemingly starts with the Pauranic approach. However it is also a full-fledg=
ed Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads. It is also simultaneously a =
text on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. The question of initiation is r=
elevant only to those following the Tantramarga and thus employing the text=
 as a mantramaya text . For those who explore the text as a yogasastra, the=
 esoteric meaning is more relevant which I have covered extensively in my w=
rite-up. For those who are already inclined to the Advaitic path, Sri Sri C=
handi provides the context for immensely powerful reflections through its c=
entral message
 of Oneness. The crest jewel, the crowning glory in the text=
 is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself proclaims in full-fledged Upanis=
hadic fashion that She is one without a second, saying "I alone exist in th=
is universe. Who else is there besides me?" (10.5). Compare it with the oth=
er Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflect on the central truth of Advaita=
.

> > > 

> > > The reason I advised the non-initiate to read in English o=
r any other regional language is because understanding the meaning and cons=
tant reflection are possible only when one repeatedly reads the text  in a =
language that they can fully follow. The main idea of the writeup is to exp=
lore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic text too apart from its obvious stat=
us as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri Chandi is also equally regarded as Sruti=
 just as the Veda Samhita, especially the four hymns. In that regard all th=
e applications of Veda mantras or the Veda Samhita are equally possible wit=
h Sri Sri Chandi and hence the practice of Chandi *HOMAM*. Anyone who is ac=
quainted with the original Vedic method will straightaway identify that Yag=
nya is the central Vedic practice. In fact even the worship of the Vigraha =
in the Hindu temple is fully based on and DERIVED from a one on one mapping=
 of the Vedic Yagasala with the Hindu temple.

> > > 

> > > Just as some p=
ractitioners do the Homam as an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi sadhana in =
accordance with the Vedic approach, there are those who adhere to the Tantr=
ic approach and do the sadhana as per the mantra marga. It is this particul=
ar approach that needs initiation as per its own principles. Initiation is =
not mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path of Viveka and Vichara, or the=
 Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even the Pauranic approach of readi=
ng the text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise Homam too is not required if =
one is not inclined to the predominantly Vaidik practice of Ritual/Yagnya. =
One may benefit from any or all of these approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. Howe=
ver one has to bear in mind that the living and breathing traditions of bot=
h Kalikula as well as Srikula as practiced originally in various parts of t=
he subcontinent originally trace themselves to Tantra marga and hence the i=
mportance of initiation for those paths, be it
 Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya=
.

> > > 

> > > In summary, one can make spiritual progress through any of=
 the merthods/practices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara, I=
swarapranidhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa etc a=
re all effective. However depending on the individual temperament, aptitude=
 etc., some of these methods are more suited relatively to different practi=
tioners. One may progress through a combination of any of these methods in =
spiritual life. However the *full-fledged* integrated approach of KALIKULA =
involves Mantra diksha too. It is this big picture against which the answer=
 to the question has to be contextualised.

> > > 

> > > Finally one last =
word. Irrespective of the method and path, SWADHYAYA and SATSANGHA are the =
most effective methods for all of us. Swadhyaya is regular self-study of te=
xts followed by reflection on the truths expounded in the texts. This is be=
st done in a language that one is fully conversant with. As for SATSANGHA i=
t is the FIRST AND BEST choice among all methods. Swadhyaya is the alternat=
e method (though not as powerful) where Satsangha is not possible. It is Sa=
tsangha and satsangha alone that enables one to make rapid progress in spir=
itual life. Sri Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted state by virtue of se=
rving, listening to and spending time in the company of sadhus and sants in=
 his younger days. Vivekananda , Jnanadeva  and  Gorakhnath  made a quantum=
 leap in their spiritual lives after they attended the Satsangha of Ramakri=
shna, Nivrittinath and Matsyendranath respectively.

a rich father may open a bank account in a son's name with a starting balan=

However, as I said several times, there are very few people who can do (i) =
now-a-days. Nature has destabilized the whole system, for a reason, as Kali=
 progressed. I suggest doing mantras and rituals only for increasing surren=
der, getting whatever material results god wants to give and making spiritu=
al progress. If one is meant to do rituals for begetting *specific* materia=
l results (for oneself or others or society/universe in general), Nature wi=
ll make arrangements for one to get correct knowledge of such rituals. But,=
 as one starts, one should start with the attitude of (ii).

he floor. But the good fruit stuck under the rotten fruits will be retrieve=
d faster. Similarly, phala of your karmas is in a basket. The deity is tryi=
ng to take bad fruits and throw them in garbage and give you a good fruit t=
o eat. There may be some spillage. A gentle deity like Ganapathi, Vishnu or=
 Lakshmi may take more time to get out the good fruit, but the spillage wil=

 Bhairava or Kali or Narasimha =
may have more spillage, but the good fruit comes out faster.

      <p>Namaste friends,<br>
 <br>
I wil=
l give my 2 cents on a few points.<br>
 <br>
*        *        *<br>
 <br>
=
I once wanted to translate Devi Saptashati into my mother tongue Telugu in =
poetic form, so that Telugu people who find Saptashati too complicated to r=
ead or feel uncomfortable because they do not know the meaning, can read th=
e Telugu version instead. When I floated the idea, Manish discouraged me. H=
e asked me, "who do you think you are?" He said that it could be considered=
 later, but firmly told me to drop the idea for then.<br>
 <br>
Please note=
 that the goal of sadhana, such as homam, meditation, chanting mantras and =
prayers, is NOT just an intellectual understanding of what they mean. They =
are tools to silence the mind and channel its energy. They are storehouses =
of some shakti left by rishis, yogis and sadhakas, who used them in the pas=
t.<br>
 <br>
An intellectual understanding may help facilitate the right mo=
od, right frame of mind and right imagery. But, even without it, a mantra t=
hat was used by great sadhakas, yogis and rishis holds power.<br>
 <br>
In =
fact, the words of a rishi that one cannot intellectually understand can be=
 more effective for spiritual progress, than the words of a normal person t=
hat one can intellectually understand and appreciate. So, I suggest not wor=
rying about whether one understands or not and reading Sanskrit mantras com=
ing from great rishis/yogis/sadhakas.<br>
 <br>
*        *        *<br>
 <b=
r>
If I were to give an analogy in terms of playing cricket, a batsman may =
read a lot of scholarly analysis on how to play shots, how to see the ball =
from the hand of the bowler, how to move feet, how get into the line of the=
 ball, how to play it with a straight bat, when to play front foot and when=
 to play back foot etc. But that does not necessarily make one a good batsm=
an. If one practices, THAT can make one a good player. Of course, some basi=
c understanding of principles is needed. But, above that, practice is more =
important than bookish knowledge.<br>
 <br>
Similarly, some conceptual unde=
rstanding is important in spirituality also, but above that, sadhana is mor=
e important.<br>
 <br>
The essence of all scriptures, all mantras, all sadh=
anas, all paths is very simple. It is that we should overcome the notions t=
hat we are doing things and realize that the divine acts through all of us.=
 The divine acts through each being based on one's conditioning and gives c=
orresponding reactions. One goes through the cycle until one overcomes the =
notions of "I am doing", "this is mine", "I like this and I dislike that" e=
tc. Though this is the essence of all scriptures and one knows it, one may =
be deluded again and again. There is no magic formula to internalize this u=
nderstanding fully and overcome the instincts of "I am doing", "this is min=
e" etc.<br>
 <br>
So, even if one practices a mantra that one does not inte=
llectually understand, that is ok. As long as the basic essence of scriptur=
es is at the back of one's mind, one is constantly contemplating and watchi=
ng over one's own thoughts and instincts, to root out undesirable thoughts,=
 one's sadhana will yield results.<br>
 <br>
*        *        *<br>
 <br>
=
This is why I keep repeating the need of sadhana. It is fine to read script=
ures and other books. It is fine to meet spiritual people (physically or vi=
rtually, like here) and discuss good things. But that will only create a th=
eoretical understanding. For it to be internalized and to govern all of one=
's instincts, thoughts and actions, one needs to do sadhana.<br>
 <br>
One =
doing sadhana without a basic theoretical understanding of what is what and=
 what we want, is like a blind person running around a mountain, instead of=
 climbing it. One not doing sadhana, but having an excellent theoretical un=
derstanfing, is like a person who knows that he needs to climb the mountain=
, but keeps staring at the pinnacle instead of climbing it.<br>
 <br>
*    =
    *        *<br>
 <br>
Regarding the statement that initiation is importa=
nt in tantric path but not in Vedic path, I want to add my 2 cents.<br>
 <b=
r>
Whether Vedic and tantrik paths are two *distinct* paths or parts of a c=
ontinuum is debatable. There are a lot of inaccurate notions today.<br>
 <b=
r>
The issue is not really Tantrik vs Vedic. The issue is one's attitude an=
d what one wants. Anybody who wants specific material results needs to be c=
areful regarding how to go about it. Re-arrangement of karmas to affect a p=
articular result is not easy. It requires supervision of a good guru and no=
t many are left anyway. On the other hand, if one is NOT looking for specif=
ic material results and is looking for spiritual progress, the constraints =
are fewer and options more.<br>
 <br>
Some may sub-consciously have a notio=
n that Tantrik path is for begetting specific material results and Vedic pa=
th is for self-realization. That is incorrect. After all, one in the Vedic =
path may chant Manyu sooktam for victory in litigation or Ayushya sooktam f=
or longevity, and so on. Similarly, one in the Tantrik path may eat a gross=
 substance in an elaborate ritual to reinforce the notion that "all is Brah=
man" and to remove the mental repulsion towards some objects.<br>
 <br>
*  =
      *        *<br>
 <br>
My thumbrule is this. If you are looking for a s=
pecific material result, you need clear guidance and supervision, which not=
 many are capable of giving today! Instead, if you want spiritual progress =
and an increase of your surrender, you can just keep doing sadhana without =
initiation or guidance. Just keep company of scriptures and other like-mind=
ed people.<br>
 <br>
After all, if you want to go to Calcutta, you need cle=
ar and precise directions and some supervision. If you just want to go to n=
orth pole, you can keep walking towards north. Of course, having supervisio=
n helps there too, but you can do without it!<br>

tya Prakash, the author of the write-up posted here. Since the last 4-5 yea=

er after Narasimha garu forwarded a copy of the original post with my write=
 up to my inbox, I visited this forum and quickly browsed through some post=
s. I am happy to note that the general atmosphere here is far better and mo=
re sincere than a lot of other forums. Having quickly browsed through this =
particular thread, I thought that I might reply to Utpal ji's question.<br>=

> > > <br>
> > > Utpal ji has raised an important questi=
on regarding the necessity of initiation. I will address it after summarizi=
ng the big picture that needs to be invoked in order to understand the ONE =
question and the MANY answers possible. Firstly is the question a general o=
r specific one? Generally speaking if the question is whether initiation is=
 an absolute requirement for spiritual life or sadhana, *my* answer is- NO.=
 However if the question is about the necessity of being initiated for mant=
ra sadhana as enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the answer is =C3=82?YES.<br>
>=
; > > <br>
> > > 'Munde munde matir bhinna' as the tantric a=

. Thus arises the inevitability of multiple perspectives. In the pan-Indian=
 context there are many paths for sadhana. But in the current context of th=
is question I will restrict myself to only the five that are relevant to th=
e discussion.<br>

Each of the above paths EMPHASISES particular methods and techniques in its=
 attempt to practicalise the abstract truths at an experiential level. Let =
us briefly look at the predominant methods/ techniques employed by each of =
these paths.<br>
> > > For those who are predominantly oriented to=
 Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking even the external guru is not necessary, =
though one can greatly benefit from the wisdom and experience of a genuine =
teacher. The direct path of Advaita emphasises the methods of Viveka (Disce=
rnment) and Vichara (self-reflection). Advaita being essentially a culminat=
ion of the Vaidik system it has retained the vaidik practice of 'Swadhyaya'=
 (regular self-study of texts) too as an important practice. All of these p=
ractices involve the 'self' in a big way with a marginal role for external =
practices.<br>
> > > <br>
> > > Yoga marga emphasises Abh=
yasa (self-coaching by consistent practice) and Vairagya (Non-reactivity or=
 Non-attachment). Hindu schools of Yoga additionally emphasise 'Iswaraprani=
dhana' (orienting oneself towards the Supreme Iswara) too while Bauddha and=
 Jina schools of Yogamarga emphasise only the first two as they subscribe t=
o nirishwaravada.<br>
> > > <br>
> > > Bhakti marga (Love=
/Devotion) emphasises unconditional acceptance of Iswara's will through tot=
al surrender to the Supreme. On the contrary the emphasis in Karma marga is=
 on Action as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita. Engaging in actions without a=
ttachment to the results is the mainstay of Karma marga of the Gita.<br>
&g=
t; > > <br>
> > > Finally I will address the Tantric path of=
 mantra sadhana where alone the inevitable necessity of initiation and ther=
eby the necessity of a Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the practicaliz=
ation of certain occult truths via the energetics of Sabda through the empl=
oyment of Vak. It presupposes certain dangers inherent to any lab experimen=
t and thereby certain regulations and safe practices. It should be remember=
ed that except Bhakti marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at various level=
s, while Bhakti predominantly invokes Soma (the reference here is to the ag=
e-old `Agni-Someeyam'). Among the paths that invoke Agni, one path invokes/=
employs the fire of the intellect, another the fire of speech, another the =
fire of austerity, and yet another the physical fire of the Yagnya and so o=
n.<br>
> > > <br>
> > > Tantra's method of invoking fire =
deals with the fire of Vak through the lab-like practical mantrasastra. Sin=
ce Tantra employs highly powerful techniques that bring results more quickl=
y it lays great emphasis on adhikara. Adhikara is not about authority but m=
ore about qualification. Would you allow a child to experiment with fire wi=
thout any supervision? Does the supervisor need experience and training or =
not? Like any other lab experiment proper training and experience are part =
of the procedure apart from certain safety measures, in the Tantric lab exp=
eriment too.  However the lab is one's own consciousness whilst the experim=
ent is awakening the Sakti within the individual consciousness (also referr=
ed to as Kundalini Sakti). As this is not a topic for mere intellectualisat=
ion, I will refrain from further discussion on the Kundalini. Without going=
 into other needless details here, I will just elaborate on initiation and =
Guru parampara.<br>
> > > <br>
> > > Since we are talking=
 about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to contextualise it within the larger Tantri=
c context too. Sakti sadhana is one major river within the Tantric context.=
 The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta sadhanas comprehensively. How=
ever there are actually three major schools that are full-fledged living tr=
aditions among the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula, Srikula and Tarakula. Sri Sri=
 Chandi sadhana belongs to Kalikula whilst Sri Vidya  sadhana belongs to Sr=
ikula. Just to make the picture more complete the Vajrayanas among the Budd=
hists (!) have taken to Tarakula. To those who are familiar with Tibetan Bu=
ddhism I will draw attention to the the 21 forms of Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayan=
a shares both the Advaitic outlook as well as the Sakta sadhanas in its app=
roach to sadhana.<br>
> > > <br>
> > > Kali kula *predomi=
nantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma is not invoked at all) while Sri kula p=
redominantly invokes Soma, at least at the major milestones in the internal=
 spiritual journey. The yantra, mantra, bija, devata, etc are all consisten=
tly of a particular set of synchronistic frequencies for each of these thre=
e lineages. Initiation is the full-fledged entry of the practitioner into a=
 particular spiritual lineage of that path (kula). The Guru parampara can b=
e compared to an INVERTED TREE with SIVA himself at the root from where the=
 trunk arises. Each branch and sub-branches and twigs spread out progressiv=
ely downward till the individual sadhaka.  It is a beautiful metaphor if yo=
u can visualise it. Another modern metaphor that one can use is that of ele=
ctricity. It is held by the Tantric advocate that initiation not only compl=
etes the circuit necessary for the conduit of electricity but also prevents=
 short circuit. Imagine many
 beautiful bulbs/lights at each point in this =
inverted tree of live wires, where there is a long series of sadhakas sitti=
ng in silent practice all the way up till Siva himself.  It is a dynamic wo=
rld of Light (Prakasa) and Sound (Sabda). Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.<br>
&=
gt; > > <br>
> > > As already stated Sakta sadhana seeks to =
awaken Sakti within the individual consciousness through an integrated appr=
oach that combines the practices of Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and Mantra. =
Both Kalikula and Srikula have evolved into highly comprehensive and integr=
ated approaches that can simultaneously hold the many in the One. Sri Sri C=
handi seemingly starts with the Pauranic approach. However it is also a ful=
l-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads. It is also simultaneo=
usly a text on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. The question of initiati=
on is relevant only to those following the Tantramarga and thus employing t=
he text as a mantramaya text . For those who explore the text as a yogasast=
ra, the esoteric meaning is more relevant which I have covered extensively =
in my write-up. For those who are already inclined to the Advaitic path, Sr=
i Sri Chandi provides the context for immensely powerful reflections throug=
h its
 central message of Oneness. The crest jewel, the crowning glory in t=
he text is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself proclaims in full-fledged=
 Upanishadic fashion that She is one without a second, saying "I alone exis=
t in this universe. Who else is there besides me?" (10.5). Compare it with =
the other Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflect on the central truth of =
Advaita.<br>
> > > <br>
> > > The reason I advised the no=
n-initiate to read in English or any other regional language is because und=
erstanding the meaning and constant reflection are possible only when one r=
epeatedly reads the text  in a language that they can fully follow. The mai=
n idea of the writeup is to explore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic text =
too apart from its obvious status as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri Chandi is=
 also equally regarded as Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especially the fo=
ur hymns. In that regard all the applications of Veda mantras or the Veda S=
amhita are equally possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the practice of C=
handi *HOMAM*. Anyone who is acquainted with the original Vedic method will=
 straightaway identify that Yagnya is the central Vedic practice. In fact e=
ven the worship of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully based on and DE=
RIVED from a one on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with the Hindu temple=
.<br>
> > > <br>
> > > Just as some practitioners do the =
Homam as an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi sadhana in accordance with the =
Vedic approach, there are those who adhere to the Tantric approach and do t=
he sadhana as per the mantra marga. It is this particular approach that nee=
ds initiation as per its own principles. Initiation is not mandatory if one=
 adopts the Vedantic path of Viveka and Vichara, or the Yogic path of Abhya=
sa and Vairagya, or even the Pauranic approach of reading the text devoutly=
 as Sacred Myth. Likewise Homam too is not required if one is not inclined =
to the predominantly Vaidik practice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may benefit from=
 any or all of these approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. However one has to bear =
in mind that the living and breathing traditions of both Kalikula as well a=
s Srikula as practiced originally in various parts of the subcontinent orig=
inally trace themselves to Tantra marga and hence the importance of initiat=
ion for those

HYAYA and SATSANGHA are the most effective methods for all of us. Swadhyaya=
 is regular self-study of texts followed by reflection on the truths expoun=
ded in the texts. This is best done in a language that one is fully convers=
ant with. As for SATSANGHA it is the FIRST AND BEST choice among all method=
s. Swadhyaya is the alternate method (though not as powerful) where Satsang=
ha is not possible. It is Satsangha and satsangha alone that enables one to=
 make rapid progress in spiritual life. Sri Ramakrishna attained the rare e=
xalted state by virtue of serving, listening to and spending time in the co=
mpany of sadhus and sants in his younger days. Vivekananda , Jnanadeva  and=

, a rich father may open a bank account in a son's name with a starting bal=

antra can transfer some of it to a disciple. However, one without a rich fa=

initiate you), get initiated. Otherwise, just go ahead and do it.<br>

owever, as I said several times, there are very few people who can do (i) n=

t. There may be some spillage. A gentle deity like Ganapathi, Vishnu or Lak=
shmi may take more time to get out the good fruit, but the spillage will be=

 Chandi or Bhairava or Kali or Narasimha may =
have more spillage, but the good fruit comes out faster.<br>
