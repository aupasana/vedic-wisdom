Namaste,
=C2=A0
> Kunjika Shotram i=
s a very powerful one, why do homan of it
=C2=A0
That is not a valid reason=
. Even a very powerful mantra can be offered in homam. On the Vedic side, R=
udra namakam and Gayatri mantra are very very powerful mantras and they are=
 offered in homam. On the Tantrik side, Pratyangira mantra, Mahasudarsana m=
antra, Paashupata mantra etc=C2=A0are very very powerful astra mantras=C2=
=A0and they are offered in homam. As these examples show, even very powerfu=
l mantras can be offered in fire for amplification.
=C2=A0

*=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =
*
=C2=A0
The power of powerful mantras is a mirage for most people. The exp=
erience given by a mantra and the internal/external results brought by a ma=
ntra vary from mantra to mantra. But, even with a very powerful mantra, one=
 needs to be ready for the mantra to actually work.
=C2=A0
When one is able=
 to perfectly control the mind and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thought=
s but the mantra reverberating in the mind constantly), then one experience=
s the mantra. This perfect absorption=C2=A0of self-awareness in the mantra =
then causes internal changes by the flow of energy internally in specific w=
ays (specific to the mantra) and that causes corresponding external changes=
 in the universe and corresponding karmic interactions between various obje=
cts. 
=C2=A0
There may be thousands of paths to climb a mountain. Each path=
 takes one to a different spot atop the mountain. The view one has from the=
 top may be different accordingly. One view may be more breathtaking and am=
azing than another. However, one taking a path leading to a breathtaking vi=
ew and one taking a path leading to a normal view both have to struggle on =
their paths and reach the top despite obstacles. Some paths may be slightly=
 shorter, but none is too easy. All paths are difficult to walk, but some r=
esult in a more breathtaking view than the others.
=C2=A0
Similarly, one ch=
anting a "powerful mantra" and a "normal mantra" will both have to put in e=
ffort and overcome the weaknesses and get control over mind. The power of t=
he powerful mantra refers to a more powerful experience after one succeeds =
with the mantra (more breathtaking scenery on reaching the mountain top). I=
t is not correct to think that things will happen automatically and easily =
because one if chanting a powerful mantra 11 (or whatever) times.

=C2=A0
Coming back to Rajarshi's question, I do not recommen=
d homam with Kunjika stotra. Kunjika stotra is a coded stotra containing se=
veral mantras in coded form. It is not what it may seem to be. It is for a =
reason that Shiva tells Parvati that this prayer should be hidden like one'=
s privates. It is weird that we are discussing such a secretive mantra on a=
 public forum. It is a collection of powerful mantras for specific prayogas=
 that would be considered raajasik/taamasik unless a realized soul without =
attachment to the actions is acting them out as an instrument of the Divine=
.
=C2=A0
I see no point in wanting to do homam with it. If you are meant to=
 do a homam with Kunjika stotra to stop the army of a country in their trac=
ks or kill someone or delude someone etc and if you are detached enough to =
carry it off successfully, then you will be given an opportunity by nature =
to learn it and do it. Otherwise, why even try?
=C2=A0
My advice is to drop=
 the idea of doing a homam with Kunjika stotra. Just stick to saptashati (7=
00 verses). If that is too long for you, try saptashloki (7 verses) or just=
 the 4th chapter or just the 11th chapter. Another option is to do a homam =
with just the moola mantra (navaakshari) .
=C2=A0
If one can pronounce the =
8 verses of Devi sooktam well,=C2=A0a homam with Devi sooktam is a great id=
ea too.
