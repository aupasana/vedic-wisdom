Namaste Shashi,
 
1. The deities are pitris (deceased ancestors in Chandra loka, i.e. residing in the domain of "mind").
 
There are some specific Veda mantras that are preferred in this homam. Several are from Atharva veda, but I think some are from Rigveda too. I can dig them up later. Regarding the preferred days/times, I am not so sure. The direction faced for this homam is not east, but south.
 
2. Yes, you can use Chandi homam or Mahalakshmi homam as a reference, by replacing the dhyaana shloka and beejaaksharass used in invocation. For the pradhaana homam, some people chant each verse by adding a swaahaa at the end of the verse, while some break up the sahasra naama stotra into a sahasra naamaavali and add swaahaa after each name (e.g. om shrImaatre namaH svaahaa, om shrImahaaraaGYyai namaH svaahaa and so on). Some add beejaaksharas before every name and say swaahaa. There are multiple ways and all are fine.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
