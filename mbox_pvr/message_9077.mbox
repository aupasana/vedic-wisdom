Namaste Sir,
 
I am sorry to know your situation and have no specific advic=
e.
 
If there is a big pile of sand blocking one's path, all I know is that=
 shoveling it away will unblock the path. I have no idea how long one needs=
 to do it. It depends on how big the pile is and how big one's shovel is. I=
n other words, the heaviness of the karmas blocking one and the intensity o=
f the remedial measures decide when one breaks through. It may be a day or =
a decade or whatever.
 
For material concerns related to finances, usually =
worship of Ganapathi or Lakshmi is recommended. Homam of Lakshmi with Kanak=
a Dhara Sotram (composed by Adi Shankara) is a good option, but I was asked=
 by my guru not to include it in Mahalakshmi homam manual as one of the opt=
ions. But one can download the stotram from the web and use it. One needs t=
o just add swaahaa at the end of each verse and make offerings.
 
There are=
 billions of really really suffering human beings (and many many more other=
 beings) on this earth. When I read news sometimes, my heart gets wrenched.=
 But, unfortunately, there is nothing I can do, except praying to Her to gi=
ve conviction and direction to those suffering, so that they can eventually=
 find their way out of their misery.
 
I hope some divine force will show y=
ou the right direction. Doing some sadhana sincerely for a while is a great=
 thing in this age. I hope some benefit accrues.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
