Namaskaram to all,

Thank you Narasimha garu for explaining beautifully how=
 karma works and for me it=A0tells me how it unfolds.
I have always wondere=
d at how 'experiences' (mostly karmic and thus payback) seek me out. Mother=
 always said (paraphrased)" do not ask "why me"?? it is because you have as=
ked for it". I have always believed it, but it astounds me=A0what have I do=
ne to reap so much of it=A0and in such a short span, is it because of how m=
uch more has to *take fruit*??
I did realise some years ago that what occur=
s has a meaning though not apparent to you/ or at the moment.
I would think=
 that Jyotish did nudge me down that path. But as Utpal Bhai said earlier t=
o know your Dharma consequential to an action demanding your action/attenti=
on is very difficult and crucial in determining future karmas. It is also a=
 Divine blessing if you could figure out what ought to be your karma at tha=
t point in time rather than reflect and introspect later, though that in it=
self is a beginning. 
After lamenting on various aspects which have proved =
not congenial to spiritual development, I have let some matters be( on advi=
ce from Narasimha garu through various messages, each one answers so many o=
f my unspoken questions). It has given me a lot of peace *inside*. Addition=
ally it has given me the onus to revel and rejoice in the blessings that Th=
e Divine Mother has bestowed on me ( though I try hard to not feel any sens=
e of joy in having been a recipient).=A0 I still find it hard to disassocia=
te myself from 'owning' the 'doership' if I do it at the completion of the =
task. I find it easier when I start a task, envisaging myself as Her Instru=
ment and being a custodian or 'performing' what Her Will is. But I find it =
extremely difficult and have to constantly remind myself that I am merely a=
n 'agent', especially when some task is well accomplished.

One doubt that =
lingers on , Narasimha Garu , would you please clarify???=A0 I always try t=
o complete/perform a task to the best of my ability and like to set myself =
high standards, would that in itself be incipient egoism? 
To sit back and =
perform an assigned task, even mundane like cooking a meal, singing a song,=
 a routine task at work, slip into mediocrity is not acceptable to me. Is t=
hat not taking ownership of success/failure? 
Sometimes I feel a hypocrite =
when I feel a wee bit happy=A0 and have to consciously hold back and thank =
Her for 'making ' me=A0do that task. 

Kind regards
Nalini

Namaste,
=A0
(1) Displa=
y of emotions is different from feeling emotions. Saints like Sai Baba and =
Ramakrishna acted angry sometimes, but I am sure they did not feel any ange=
r in their heart.
=A0
It is not about how you come across to others. It is =
about how you feel inside. A person who achieved sthitaprajnata feels the s=
ame way whether good things happen or bad things happen. He is not dull. He=
 may look happy, sad, angry and calm=A0at different times, but his heart do=
es not feel much emotion and in a calm and stable state alwats.
=A0
"Yoga V=
aasishtham" is a good book to read to understand various aspects related to=
 sthitaprajnata. But, more than understanding that state, it is important t=
o make progress towards reaching that state oneself. Not thinking too much =
about what others do to you is a good starting point.=A0
=A0
(2) One should=
 always do one's dharma (right action). What Mr X should do in this specifi=
c case depends on his dharma. The tasks assigned to Mr X by nature may requ=
ire him to ignore the distraction posed by the rowdy person and focus on hi=
s main task. In another case, the tasks assigned to Mr X by nature may requ=
ire him to beat up this aggressor and show something to some people.
=A0
Ei=
ther could be correct. Right action changes from person to person and situa=
tion to situation. However, as long as Mr X thinks "this person unfairly hi=
t me. I should take revenge" and takes action based on that thinking,=A0he =
will be stuck and what Nature expecs from him will not be clear to him.
=A0=

One who does not have a dense ego can mostly know what Nautre expects from=
 one, do the right actions and pay off karmik debts. One who has a dense eg=
o, which keeps interfering with one's sense of dharma, will be lost and eng=
aging in unnecessary acts which increase the debts instead of reducing them=
.
=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

 ego (I-ness). As one dies and gets reborn, this ego (sense of I-ness) is c=
ut off from one body and environment and re-attached to another body and en=
vironment. Nature tracks this change. Just as post office delivers all mail=
 addressed to your old apartment to your new apartment when you change addr=

 actions to the sen=
se of I-ness in this life.
>>=A0 
>> As long as one is embodied and has a s=

it by wife, being abused by husband, being killed by a brother, being cheat=
ed by a friend etc etc are examples of reactions to previous actions. As lo=
ng as one's sense of I-ness is bound to a body, Nature will continue to del=
iver reactions to previous actions. If one gets an Oscar award as a result =
of previous good karma, it is not necessary that one should be happy or exc=

a is meaningful only if that reaction makes one happy. How one feels NOW is=
 irrelevant. If one is cheated, it is not necessary that one should feel sa=

meaningful only if that
 reaction disappoints him. You cheated someone. Nat=

 doing its job.

a person in a previous life. Suppose Nature arranged for that person to che=

your way with neither happiness nor sadness, but with a calm and relaxed mi=
nd. On top of it, keep doing what seems like the right thing to do at the m=

 another question is regarding
 Karma(Action and Reaction)<BR>> <BR>>=
 Take a case - somebody, say a rawdy person Slaps a person 'x'. Mr. X didn'=

ma or he should give back the same medicine to the abuser.<BR>> <BR>>=
 In either of the above options, how Mr. X can remain (act) without  d=
etachment.how such state can be achieved. however we say that we should do =
detached karma, it does not seem possible. how to achieve that?<BR>> <BR=

 reaction balance. IF you resist
 and apply some force NOW, it becomes a ne=

   *<BR>>>  <BR>>> Even a person of a high level=
 of mental equanimity and stability does have an ego. Each living person ha=
s a limited ego (I-ness) which binds him to a body and an identity (e.g. PV=
R Narasimha Rao, who looks like this, who knows so and so things, who does =
so and so things, who wants so and so things, who is the husband of Padmaja=
, who is the father of Sriharini and Sriharish, who is the sishya of Manish=
 Pandit etc etc). If the binding is completely removed and one becomes comp=
letely unbound from that limited sense of I-ness, one will no longer remain=
 in the body. So any embodied being must have a limited ego (I-ness). As on=
e dies and gets reborn, this ego (sense of I-ness) is cut off from one body=
 and environment and
 re-attached to another body and environment. Nature t=
racks this change. Just as post office delivers all mail addressed to your =
old apartment to your new apartment when you change address, Nature deliver=
s the reactions of all previous life actions to the sense of I-ness in this=
 life.<BR>>>  <BR>>> As long as one is embodied and has a =
sense of I-ness, Nature will continue to deliver the reactions to various p=
revious actions from that being. Death of wife in an accident, getting an O=
scar award, losing an election, being criticized by thousand people, being =
hit by wife, being abused by husband, being killed by a brother, being chea=
ted by a friend etc etc are examples of reactions to previous actions. As l=
ong as one's sense of I-ness is bound to a body, Nature will continue to de=
liver reactions to previous actions. If one gets an Oscar award as a result=
 of previous good karma, it is not necessary that one should be happy or ex=
cited or
 elated. Do not think that a reaction from Nature to one's good ka=
rma is meaningful only if that reaction makes one happy. How one feels NOW =
is irrelevant. If one is cheated, it is not necessary that one should feel =
sad or angry. Do not think that a reaction from Nature to one's bad karma i=
s meaningful only if that reaction disappoints him. You cheated someone. Na=
ture will arrange such that that person cheats you now. How you feel about =
it now is not relevant as far as the old action-reaction equation is concer=
ned. Thus, being equanimous, equal-minded and calm does not stop Nature fro=
m doing its job.<BR>>>  <BR>>> In fact, it is better that =
way. By not reacting to what is happening now, one is preventing new karmas=
. Suppose you cheated a person in a previous life. Suppose Nature arranged =
for that person to cheat you now. His cheating you is merely a reaction to =
your own action (but if he does it with self-identification with the action=
,
 it becomes a new karma for that person. But, that is irrelevant to you).=
 If you just face it calmly and without doing anything, you finish off your=
 karmic debt. Instead, suppose you fight and try to stop the person from ch=
eating you. Then your current actions would become a NEW karma and you will=
 have to face its reaction later. If you want to pay off old debts without =
incurring new ones, you have to behave like the person you described below.=
 Accept whatever comes your way with neither happiness nor sadness, but wit=
h a calm and relaxed mind. On top of it, keep doing what seems like the rig=
ht thing to do at the moment, with as little self-identification (sense of =
"I am doing this") as possible. As you become better at this, your instinct=
s and judgment will guide you better and show you the right action.<BR>>=
