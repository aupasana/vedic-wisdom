Namaste Aparna ji,
=C2=A0Forget about balancing spiritual life with materia=
l life. Even with 2 materially oriented people, there can be big clashes of=
 personality. Bottomline is that no 2 persons have perfectly aligned agenda=
s. There is a clash between aspirations, expectations and agendas, as long =
as different people are living inter-dependent lives together. Husband may =
want to watch a game on TV and wife may want to go out to a movie. Husband =
may want to move to California for a better job and wife may want to stay p=
ut in New York where she has a great job. Husband may not want a child for =
a few more years and wife may want one. So many clashes occur even among ma=
terially oriented couples and one has to balance one's priorities, aspirati=
ons and agendas with those of others in one's life.
=C2=A0

=
=C2=A0
Why just between 2 people? Even within a single person, so many hope=
s, aspirations and desires lie latent as conditioning. They are all constan=
tly fighting with each other for the fuel (shakti) to advance further! The =
more time one spends thinking of some aspiration, it derives some shakti fr=
om one's mind to advance further! One needs to set priorities and not waste=
 time (and energy!) thinking unnecessary thoughts and dispersing mind's ene=
rgy in opposite directions..

=C2=A0
Whether it's ma=
terial things or spiritual, the key to success is to follow portions of one=
's agenda that cause the least inconvenience to others. When one lives with=
 others, some compromises are needed.
=C2=A0
The ability to put oneself in =
the other's shoes, understand how the other person is thinking and be compa=
ssionate to the other's point of view, is a great blessing. Through spiritu=
al sadhana, that ability should eventually be perfected. If one tries consc=
iously, it can come faster.
=C2=A0
Don't confuse compassion for appeasement=
. If I determine that something is too important for me to compromise, I ma=
y not listen to my wife anyway. Yet, if I at least try to understand where =
she is coming from, how she is thinking, what her views and agendas are, I =
can disagree with her without any anger or hatred in my heart. Instead, if =
I keep thinking of my own view and not even try to understand the picture f=
rom her side, my heart may be seething with anger and dissatisfaction.
=C2=
=A0
Compassion allows us to do the right thing without negative vibrations =
weakening the heart.
=C2=A0
Please note that these vibrations in one's hear=
t do resonate in the other person. Even if I am very dexterous with words a=
nd say something sweet and diplomatic, any frustration or dissatisfaction o=
r anger in my heart will express itself as the sub-text behind the words an=
d the other heart does sense it. And, remember - anger feeds anger; dissati=
sfaction feeds dissatisfaction; and, sadness feeds sadness. The gap between=
 2 people widens by sending these negative vibrations to the other.
=C2=A0
=
Instead, if you first try to genuinely feel positive vibrations in your hea=
rt and send them out, even as you disagree and do as you want, it will even=
tually start to balance the other person too.

=C2=A0R=
egarding your personal questions:

=C2=A0
Thereare many people who spend ma=
ny more hours in sadhana than I do..
=C2=A0
Yes, I wake up at 4 am and do m=
y homam and japam early on. On weekdays, we are all on our own anyway. On w=
eekends, I am done with everything long before others brush and come downst=
airs.
=C2=A0
There are several temples and satsangs nearby, but I hardly go=
 to them. My homam room is my temple and my satsang.

=C2=A0

As for saattw=
ik diet, I cook kichidi for myself and don't require anybody to cook for me=
. Also, I do not force anybody else to eat it, though they may eat it rarel=
y when there is nothing else.
=C2=A0
As I enjoy cooking, I also frequently =
cook other general (i.e. non-saattwik) food items for family. When I do tha=
t, I may taste what I make.I also occasionally eat at restaurants with fami=
ly. In other words, I try to eat saattwik food as far as possible, but not =
100% strict at the moment. There was a period in the past when I was.

=C2=
=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
No natural food is universally good or bad. Oni=
ons (especially raw), for example, are awful for a vata person like me. But=
 they are cooling and awesome for a pitta person.
=C2=A0
Chocolates are not=
 that bad in moderation - the main problem with chocolates is that they are=
 heavily processed. Cacao beans are artificially processed to make cocoa bu=
tter, cocoa liquor etc, which is used in chocolates.Now-a-days, for lowerin=
g the price, chocolate companies in US are even using Polyglycerol polyrici=
noleate (PGPR), which, though safe in small quantities, is related to the p=
oison ricin. Now-a-days, processed food is all about low price, loooong she=
lf life and having a uniform consistency and texture, rather than actual go=
odness.

=C2=A0
I avoid most processed foods and make my food from basic, n=
atural, raw ingredients as far as possible. As for chocolate and hot chocol=
ate, I occasionally enjoy a tea made of milk, cardamom powder, raw sugar an=
d unprocessed organic cacao bean powder. This simpler version of hot chocol=
ate is probably closer to what ancient Mayans enjoyed (and called the "drin=
k of gods"), compared to the *heavily* processed "hot chocolate" sold by mo=
dern brands. Though cacao beans are drying to the body and not great for a =
vata person like me, they are better than coffee and tea. So I take it occa=
sionally for the flavinoids in them.
=C2=A0
Balance is the key. Eat what is=
 good for you 80% of the time. Eat other things now and then, but balance t=
hem with ingredients that compensate for their bad qualities. Then your bod=
y will get balanced nutrition. Some familiarity with ayurveda is very very =
useful (read "Prakriti: Your Ayurvedic Constitution" and "Yoga of Herbs"). =
The notions on nutrition and health in popular culture are utterly nonsensi=
cal.

=C2=A0

Narasimha

>=C2=A0When I offer poornahut=
i (a whole dry coconut) in my homam, I pre-arrange burnt wood coals in a st=
ructure that has nice air flow. When coconut is placed atop those coals, it=
 does not crush everything (in which case, some stuff under coconut or bott=
om of coconut may burn fully by the time fire goes off), but gets suspended=
 on the coals with most of the coconut getting air circulation. It burns ni=
cely from all sides, including the bottom. If this is not possible, you may=
 want to turn the poornahuti around in the middle (while there is still fir=
e) and perhaps change its position/place (and offer a little more ghee then=
). In my case, I go into one-hour japam after poornahuti and do not want to=
 stop meditation in the middle to take care of poornahuti. So I arrange thi=
ngs nicely beforehand. The way it is placed, it just burns completely and e=
verything offered before also burns completely, by the time fire goes off b=
y itself.

>=C2=A0
>I believe Shree=

 of Divinity and you should let it process your offerings completely and gi=

f all, milk is not a symbol of pure consciousness. Milk has a specific tast=
e and color (sweetness and white) and not really a symbol of guna-less pure=
 consciousness. Secondly, fire is the symbol of Divinity and you should let=
 it process your offerings completely and give the results in due time. You=
 can't try to force things. Pouring milk under the pretext that it is "pure=
 consciousness" is akin to doing some sadhana and pretending that you are n=
ow in samadhi. That only results in delusions and theatrics and not real sa=
madhi. If you want real samadhi, you need true surrender. True surrender re=
quires infinite patience.</span></div><div style=3D"color:rgb(0, 0,
