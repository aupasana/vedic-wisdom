Dear Ramakrishnaji
=C2=A0
It has been about two years since I had that conv=
ersation. And after that we had conversed on many different topics, (when I=
 say conversation, mostly him talking I listening or asking questions). So =
I have forgotten large part of the conversation, I represented whatever I c=
ould assimilate and remember.
=C2=A0
About tattwas he had told me that inde=
ed everything around us is but a play of these five. During those days I us=
ed to suffer from cronic depression. He looked at me and told me, "when the=
 jal tattwa in the body reduces compared to the agni, the jal becomes vayu =
and vayu increases disproportionately. This when not controlled, leads to s=
tates which modern medical science calls depression"..
I don't know if it s=
ounds too simplistic, but that is what he had told me one day. And he had s=
tressed that even God himself cannot have perfect mastery over more than 16=
 kalas when he manifests in a human form. But that itself is exceptional. N=
o other being except for Krishna had such a state, or will ever have such a=
 state in this cycle of creation. 
=C2=A0
These 64 kalas (jyotish was one o=
f the kalas in there i remember) also relate to the 64 yognis.However the y=
oginis supposedly represent the raw energy associated with the kalas. There=
fore, the yoginis can be VERY harmful unless one knows what one is doing. I=
t is like raw lightning. When controlled and brought into our homes as elec=
tricity its wonderful, but when unleashed in nature, they are entirely dest=
ructive.
=C2=A0
I remember whenever he was meeting someone new or in a new =
place, every five ten minutes he would keep staring at his own palm for a f=
ew second. Very intensely. One day I asked him, why does he do that. He sai=
d, "I check the placement and degree of the tattwas around me. The five fin=
gers give me an indication of the tattwas at that time and place which in t=
urn tells me everything about the person or situation around me. What has h=
appened, what is happening and what is most likely to happen."
=C2=A0
Sorry=
 this may not be what you had wanted to know, but this is what I could reme=
mber at this moment. Most part of the conversation would fly off tangential=
ly above my head when he used to tell me these things.
=C2=A0
-Regards

Rajarshi Ji=

=C2=A0
Thank you for sharing this. Because of the number 16, I assumed it=
 is related to moon phases and totally forgot that kala also means art.
=C2=
=A0
I'm not sure if the 64 arts that you mentioned are the normal 64 arts m=
entioned in our books like singing etc or some special spiritual arts. It i=
s quite surpising to know that even a God can't be a master of these arts w=
hen he is in the physical plane.

This is interesting. If you have some more details=

Dear Ramakrishnaji
=C2=A0
I had once met a very genuine sadhak for whom I =
have a huge amount of respect. This person was telling me about the 64 kala=
s. Not that I could understand everything that he was telling me, but let m=
e try and reproduce whatever I could understand.
=C2=A0
He showed me an old=
 diagram where there was one circle that was moving out from a centre like =
a whirlpool with three concentric arms. Each arm was one layer of the 64 ka=
las. Thus in total there were 64 such "arts" placed at various places on th=
e circle. At the centre was atmavidya. 
He said these 64 represent 64 diffe=
rent kinds of knowledge across the three realms. A man when born in this ph=
syical plane, can at the maximum acquire mastery of ONLY 16 of these Kalas.=
 It is impossible to master even one more Kala staying in this physical bod=
y. And ONLY Krishna had such a mastery.That is why=C2=A0he is purna avatar.=

=C2=A0
Even Lord Rama was not a 16 kala purna purusha. To gain mastery of =
one more then 16 would mean leaving the physical body and going into other =
subtle realms. 
=C2=A0
For an ordianry person, even mastery (by mastery I m=
ean perfected knowledge) of even a few (3/4) of these Kala is an exceptiona=
l feat. Such a man is regarded as unique, genius, beyond words.
=C2=A0
Now =
this 16/64 is theoritically=C2=A0the maximum knowledge of all aspects of=C2=
=A0the universe that a man can gain from his physical body. Which is roughl=
y 1/4th. 
=C2=A0
While talking about this, he was also trying to explain to=
 me how these kalas interact with tattwas, or rather how and in what degree=
 should each tattwa interact with a person in his system for him to be able=
 to gain mastery of any particular of these 64 kalas. Then he was talking m=
ostlt about tattwas, and that by knowing the exact age at which a=C2=A0 rea=
lly spiritual person leaves his body, it can be ascertained whether he had =
use and access to tattwas beyond the 5 gross "asudha tattwas" of this physi=
cal plane of existence. 
=C2=A0
Anyway I know this may all sound very jumbl=
ed up and incoherent, but thats entirely because of my own limitation of un=
derstanding.

Namaste Dinesh,

Your skepticism i=
s justified.

The duality is infinite and impossible to master. Even great =
jnaanis are 
occasionally deluded by Her power. One can understand unmanife=
sted non-dual 
Brahman, but one cannot hope to understand the dual world fu=
lly ever. She is 
capable of deluding even the greatest sadhaka with a wron=
g idea as soon as 
one ventures into duality. She can mislead *anyone* on *=
anything*. What She 
does and why She does that is so difficult to fathom. =
The only way to deal 
with Her is to surrender to Her power *fully*.

> on =
the other hand we are all a part of Divinity

BTW, though we are all part o=
f the same Divinity, we are all not the same. 
In the non-dual field, we ar=
e all the same. But, in the field of duality, we 
have differences due to p=
revious vasanas (conditioning) , which decide what 
and how much we can do =
within the dual world. When a being like Krishna is 
born with 16 kalas, He=
 can do *anything* with the objects of the dual world. 
When a being like S=
ai Baba is born with 2 or 3 kalas, He can do a lot of 
things in the dual w=
orld that are impossible for others.

Realizing the non-dual Self is someth=
ing that is possible for anyone, but 
there are limits imposed on what thin=
gs one can do in the dual world, based 
on the force of previous conditioni=
ng. Thus, all are the same at one 
(non-dual) level and all are different a=
t another (dual) level.

But it is tough to know for sure what one's calibe=
r is. Thus, your basic 
point holds. But I just wanted to point that all ar=
e not indeed the same. We 
should be disinterested in knowing who is what, =
not because all are the 
same, but because we have no surefire way to know =
who is what.

Best regards,
Narasimha

top" style=3D"font: inherit;"><DIV>Dear Ramakrishnaji</DIV>
<DIV> </DI=
V>
<DIV>It has been about two years since I had that conversation. And afte=
r that we had conversed on many different topics, (when I say conversation,=
 mostly him talking I listening or asking questions). So I have forgotten l=
arge part of the conversation, I represented whatever I could assimilate an=
d remember.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>About tattwas he had told me that =
indeed everything around us is but a play of these five. During those days =
I used to suffer from cronic depression. He looked at me and told me, "when=
 the jal tattwa in the body reduces compared to the agni, the jal becomes v=
ayu and vayu increases disproportionately. This when not controlled, leads =
to states which modern medical science calls depression"..</DIV>
<DIV>I don=
't know if it sounds too simplistic, but that is what he had told me one da=
y. And he had stressed that even God himself cannot have perfect mastery ov=
er more than 16 kalas when he manifests in a human form. But that itself is=
 exceptional. No other being except for Krishna had such a state, or will e=
ver have such a state in this cycle of creation. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<=
DIV>These 64 kalas (jyotish was one of the kalas in there i remember) also =
relate to the 64 yognis.However the yoginis supposedly represent the raw en=
ergy associated with the kalas. Therefore, the yoginis can be VERY harmful =
unless one knows what one is doing. It is like raw lightning. When controll=
ed and brought into our homes as electricity its wonderful, but when unleas=
hed in nature, they are entirely destructive.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>=
I remember whenever he was meeting someone new or in a new place, every fiv=
e ten minutes he would keep staring at his own palm for a few second. Very =
intensely. One day I asked him, why does he do that. He said, "I check the =
placement and degree of the tattwas around me. The five fingers give me an =
indication of the tattwas at that time and place which in turn tells me eve=
rything about the person or situation around me. What has happened, what is=
 happening and what is most likely to happen."</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV=
>Sorry this may not be what you had wanted to know, but this is what I coul=
d remember at this moment. Most part of the conversation would fly off tang=
entially above my head when he used to tell me these things.</DIV>

<DIV>Dear Ramakrishnaj=
i</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>I had once met a very genuine sadhak for who=
m I have a huge amount of respect. This person was telling me about the 64 =
kalas. Not that I could understand everything that he was telling me, but l=
et me try and reproduce whatever I could understand.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV=
>
<DIV>He showed me an old diagram where there was one circle that was movi=
ng out from a centre like a whirlpool with three concentric arms. Each arm =
was one layer of the 64 kalas. Thus in total there were 64 such "arts" plac=
ed at various places on the circle. At the centre was atmavidya. </DIV>
<DI=
V>He said these 64 represent 64 different kinds of knowledge across the thr=
ee realms. A man when born in this phsyical plane, can at the maximum acqui=
re mastery of ONLY 16 of these Kalas. It is impossible to master even one m=
ore Kala staying in this physical body. And ONLY Krishna had such a mastery=
.That is why he is purna avatar.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Even Lor=
d Rama was not a 16 kala purna purusha. To gain mastery of one more then 16=
 would mean leaving the physical body and going into other subtle realms. <=
/DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>For an ordianry person, even mastery (by maste=
ry I mean perfected knowledge) of even a few (3/4) of these Kala is an exce=
ptional feat. Such a man is regarded as unique, genius, beyond words.</DIV>=

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Now this 16/64 is theoritically the maximum kn=
owledge of all aspects of the universe that a man can gain from his ph=
ysical body. Which is roughly 1/4th. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>While ta=
lking about this, he was also trying to explain to me how these kalas inter=
act with tattwas, or rather how and in what degree should each tattwa inter=
act with a person in his system for him to be able to gain mastery of any p=
articular of these 64 kalas. Then he was talking mostlt about tattwas, and =
that by knowing the exact age at which a  really spiritual person leav=
es his body, it can be ascertained whether he had use and access to tattwas=
 beyond the 5 gross "asudha tattwas" of this physical plane of existence. <=
/DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Anyway I know this may all sound very jumbled =
up and incoherent, but thats entirely because of my own limitation of under=
standing. </DIV>
