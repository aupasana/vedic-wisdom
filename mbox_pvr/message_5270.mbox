Namaste Narasimha Rao Ji,

I do understand that you are saying that it is i=
mportant to efface once ego for 
success in sadhana and while I read and Vi=
malananada's book and do like him for 
what he was able to achieve, I still=
 see ego in him when he disrupts TV 
transmission of of an interview where =
is he not rightly acknowledged or killing 
another sadhu for taking a space=
 he prefers for meditation in a cave. I also see 
ego in his Senior Guru Ma=
haraj for cursing the ailing sadhu to lifetime of 
illness for not being gi=
ven audience and I see ego in them in much the same way 
you and other peop=
le see ego in Ravana. Ravana was a tapasvi of a very high 
caliber. Yet peo=
ple burn his effigy on dussera. How many times do we see his 
actions ident=
ified with his deity? We call Ravana fare and square a demon. 
Robert Svobo=
da puts up a very positive image of Vimalananda so we see only 
positive in=
 him. Ravana is put in a very bad light by some scriptures and we see 
only=
 bad in him, yet he was a very powerful sadhaka than Vimalanada or his 
sen=
ior guru maharaja for sure. So why cannot we see Ravana's action as divine =

play and stop Ravana dahan on dussera? And if we see Ravana as egoisitic, =
then 
for sure why the incidents I mention from Vimalanada's book cannot be=
 seen in a 
similar way. But htese are all great sadhak and were greatly su=
ccessful in 
whatever they tried to achieve from their sadhana.

I am not v=
ery well versed with scriptures so I find it hard to quote from them 
or re=
member all the names, but do you remember a rishi from the Mahabharata who =

was pleaded to Duryodhana to pay a visit pandavas in the forest. This rish=
i was 
very pleased by the hospitality shown by Duryodhana. But this rishi =
was well 
known for his temper and often feared by people. It is exactly fo=
r this reason 
why Duryodhana invited this rishi to his palace and provided=
 him with all 
hospitality so that he could convince this rishi to pay visi=
t to panadavas who 
would not be able to accomodate the rishi this lavishly=
 and therefore would have 
to suffer his curse.If this rishi was so tempera=
mental, how was he so succesful 
in his sadhana? I read so frequently=C2=A0=
about the need to give up anger for success 
in sadhana.=C2=A0This apparent=
ly does not seem=C2=A0to apply to=C2=A0this rishi. He was 
successful regar=
dless. Vimalanada's book also mentions that this rishi was later 
punished =
by Lord Visnu and had 10,000 years of his tapasya fruits taken away 
from h=
im. If everything that these rishi's do has to be identified with their 
de=
ity and therefore cannot be faulted, why did Lord Visnu have to punish him?=


I am not saying that I should not change my svabhau to achieve success in=
 
sadhana. It is never nice to be too temperamental of egositic, but it is =

certainly not easy to change once nature either. we can only hope that chn=
age in 
svabhau can be brought about by our sadhana, but if we are not goin=
g to be 
successful in a our irrespective of our effort becuase of our svab=
hau, and if we 
do not have the strength to change ourselves, basically bas=
ed on what you are 
saying we will not progress. That is depressing. I am n=
ot trying to start an 
argument here, but I simply do not get it. I see ego=
 in all the poeple of the 
stories I mentioned and all of them are about gr=
eat sadhaks.

Lastly that link to the=C2=A0post=C2=A0regarding Manish is ve=
ry interesting. You did not 
send this to me before. You did make a mention=
 though about Vimalanada Aghora 
series of books, and in the same message, =
you mentioned someone who was able to 
achieve specifioc results from speci=
fic sadhana's by reading this book. That is 
what drew my attention to that=
 book and finally made me join this yahoo group as 
a way to get in touch w=
ith you. It could be that your message had gone to the 
SPAM folder.You are=
 very fortunate to have met him and=C2=A0have his guidance.

While I am on =
this subject of success in sadhana, I do the Super Short version 
of the ho=
ma on a=C2=A0weekly basis. As I read and try to learn the regular version, =
I 
see that it makes use of darbha grass in various places. Just like you i=
n 
Boston, we have a similar climate here in Toronto. How do you get grass =
let 
alone darbha during the 4-6 months of freezing temperature? Do you gro=
w them in 
a pot? If so, what variety of lawn seeds you buy to grow darbha?=
 You also 
mention that one should not be looking for specific results from=
 once sadhana. 
Before the commencement of the sadhana or homa, what should=
 one declare as the 
motive in such a case? I have to tell you here that I =
cannot lie about my 
intentions to God. And=C2=A0if I do, I will probably k=
eep thinking about it for the 
duration of the sadhana and the whole experi=
ence gioes to waste as the mind is 
not at ease.=C2=A0=C2=A0How about when =
one is not clear about the specific reasons for 
doing homa or sadhana but =
you were doing it for a specific purpose but now with

homa, feel good =
doing it=C2=A0and do not want to give up? Is it important to declare 
a mot=
ive before commencing sadhana?

Thanks,
Bhupendra.

=C2=A0 
Namaste Sir,

Let me add my 2 cents of perspective on yo=
ur nice observations.

> The examples I give above does not illustrate a pi=
cture of people who were
> compassionate and always willing to forgive and =
forget.

Forgiving and forgetting is not necessarily saattwik, when it is t=
he work of a 
dense ego. For example, one may do it to look good or impress=
 others. Similarly, 
hurting someone is not necessarily taamasik/raajasik, =
when it is a result of a 
light ego. For example, Maharshi Bhrigu hitting V=
ishnu in the chest with his 
foot was a divine drama for a higher purpose.
=

Copying the actions of divine beings requires some intelligence. To borrow=
 an 
idiom from my mother tongue, a fox does not become a tiger if it paint=
s stripes 
on its body.

People you are talking about are very high level b=
eings. Those who efface their 
ego and start to self-identify with some hig=
her deities will start to exhibit 
the nature of those deities. Their actio=
ns may be fierce at times, but their 
purpose will be divine.

Whether one =
wants liberation or one wants saayujya (togetherness) or yoga 
(oneness) of=
 a deity or whatever one wants, the first step is to efface ego. All 
sadha=
nas are meant for that only. If you want to achieve what Vimalananda or 
so=
meone else achieved, the starting point is to efface your ego through sadha=
na. 
As you make progress, at some stage, you may start seeing some results=
.

* * *

> Nobody here I

a few rounds of rosary for a
> particular mantra....but certianly what is r=

 to us.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve noticeable results if on=
e is thinking 
of it. A cricketer telling himself "I must score a century t=
oday" is unlikely to 
score a century. The best strategy is to take it a ba=
ll at a time and focus. 
Similarly, best strategy in sadhana is to stop thi=
nking about results and just 
focusing on the "here and now".

Moreover, li=
beration is not ruled out even in this age. Ramakrishna said that he 
would=
 come back a century later and that people would be liberated en masse in 
=
that birth. Even in these times, it is possible to be liberated.

* * *

Bh=
upendra ji, here is a mail I sent before you joined this list. Manish 
cons=
iders himself a spiritual son of Vimalananda and has a similar nature. I am=
 
privately aware of some incidents similar to what you described below wit=
h 
Vimalananda. However, the essence of Manish's mesage is to do sadhana an=
d efface 
ego, i.e. what I wrote above.

 Do you recall an instance from his book when he goes to a<BR>> cave to =
perform a sadhana and finds somewhere else there? After a brief<BR>> arg=
ument, when the other sadhu would not budge, he dies! Similarly when R=
obert<BR>> Svoboda does not acknowledge Vimalnanda during a TV interview=
, Vimalananda goes<BR>> mad inspite of Robert trying to explain his reas=
ons for not acknowledging him.<BR>> Vimalanada did not like to draw atte=
ntion to himself and secondly he was<BR>> sick, and that was the re=
ason why Robert did not acknowledge any help he had<BR>> received from V=
imalananda - to avoid people crowding at his door,
 but<BR>> Vimalananda=
 could not be pacified and had the TV transmission disabled at the<BR>> =
time the interview was going to be aired. Why was Vimalananda seeking<BR>&g=
t; acknowledgement even when he claims he does not like public attention! P=
robably<BR>> transmission breaking down was again part of divine will yo=
u think? Robert<BR>> Sbvoboda himself mentions in the opening chapter th=
at dealing with Vimalananda<BR>> was impossible especially when one know=
s he is wrong but will never admit to his<BR>> mistake.<BR>><BR>> =
Then there was the story of his Senior Guru Maharaj has was denied audience=
 by a<BR>> sick sadhu. The senior guru maharaj is so insulted by this, h=
e curses this ill<BR>> sadhu with lifetime of that sickness and that sad=
hu finally succumbs to that and<BR>> dies! Now if I like to meet somebod=
y and am denied audience, do I curse them to<BR>> death?<BR>><BR>>=
 The examples I give above does not
 illustrate a picture of people who wer=
e<BR>> compassionate and always willing to forgive and forget. But still=
, they were<BR>> hugely successful in their sadhana in their own way. An=
d that is what we are<BR>> talking about here....the pre-requisite to su=
ccess in sadhana. Nobody here I<BR>> thinks expects to acheive liberatio=
n repeating a few rounds of rosary for a<BR>> particular mantra....but c=
ertianly what is required such that our sadhana<BR>> produces results th=
at are easily noticeable to us. I am getting a feeling though<BR>> that =
there is really no prerequisite or nobody really knows those<BR>> pre-re=
quisites. I guess once just hasd to put in their best effort and continue<B=

 my two cents with a hope that you will forgive me for my mistakes.<BR>>=
<BR>> As you know that sadhna increase flow of spiritual energy in our s=
ubtle body and<BR>> for accomodating that increased intensity and flow o=
f spiritual energy we need<BR>> clean and open channels. ( or nadis - so=
rry if i am choosing bad words) if those<BR>> channels are not clean the=
n that energy flow can create
 unpleasant experiences<BR>> like increase=
d anger, lust etc. and opposite if channels are clean enough.<BR>><BR>&g=
t; Rishis have clean channels and they flow along with divine will. curses =
and<BR>> blessings they give are just part of divine will. like curse gi=
ven to lord<BR>> vishnu by sage narda which led to ramayana. similarly c=
urses given to yadav<BR>> vansh and king prikshit played an important ro=
le. vimlananda was a cool guy<BR>> except few times when he was markedly=
 irritated.Like in an incidence where one<BR>> of his female disciple tr=
ied to illude him by coming almost naked in front of<BR>> him to learn h=
ow to become a bhairavi. he was irritated because he felt that his<BR>> =
student did not learnt well what he taught to her.<BR>><BR>><BR>> =
On other side people with some impurities like i-ness and pride may not be =
able<BR>> to handle that energy well. and can experience increased anger=
 lust etc. like<BR>>
 ravana and sadhaka u are mentioning. Although i pe=
rsonally believe that this is<BR>> also part of divine will.<BR>><BR>=
