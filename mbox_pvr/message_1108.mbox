Namaste Sri Radhakrishnan,
=C2=A0
While I respect the orthodoxy of =
Kerala temples, it will not work in cold countries and even in north India =
during winter.=C2=A0Many priests do wear shirts when performing homas in wi=
nter here, in Boston, USA.
=C2=A0
Honestly, the clothes that we wrap around=
 the body to hide the true body are not a major issue and have very little =
bearing on our sadhana. The layers of conditioning by various gunas that we=
 wrap around our ego-consciousness to hide the true Self=C2=A0IS the major =
issue that blocks our spiritual progress. The former is a symbol and the la=
tter is the real thing that matters. Shedding those layers surrounding the =
ego is far more important than removing shirt.
=C2=A0
Actually, though I li=
ve in cold climate, the room in which I recorded the video was comfortable =
enough and I could have done without the shirt. But I consciously chose to =
record it with a shirt on, in order to not send a wrong message to those li=
ving in cold climates and having to do homam in cold garages. Instead of st=
icking to unnecessarily strict=C2=A0rules and ending up not doing homam as =
often, I want people to relax rules that do not matter=C2=A0and do it as of=
ten as they can. I want to de-emphasize things that do not matter that much=
.
=C2=A0
World is going to go through interesting times and we need many se=
rious sadhakas - those who may be wearing many clothes on the body but shed=
 off as many layers as possible on their ego=C2=A0- doing homam on a regula=
r basis.
=C2=A0
I use more materials in my daily Chandi homam (because I us=
e a bigger homa kundam for it) than I used in the video, but again that was=
 a conscious choice. I did not want something elaborate. I wanted to demons=
trate how a very=C2=A0simple homam can be performed quite easily with very =
few materials and a simple setup. Even a very simple procedure like this wi=
ll make a big difference in the world, if a lot of people are doing this si=
ncerely everyday.
=C2=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

Subject: Maha Ganapathi Homam Video (=
based on the manual)

Namaste friends,

This weekend, Ravi shot video of a =
20-minute Maha Ganapathi homam being 
performed by me, based on the procedu=
re in the manual. He uploaded it to 
Google Video and YouTube today. What i=
s in Google Video is one file that is 
20 min 28 min long (and 92 MB in siz=
e). It is downloadable to your computer 
and you can play it using free sof=
tware QuickTime. On YouTube, it is stored 
as three parts and has a higher =
quality. You can play those three parts 
directly from YouTube.

If you go =
to the homam homepage (see below) and go to Maha Ganapathi Homam 
page, you=
 will see all related links right there.

To limit the video size, we made =
everything bare minimum. The veda mantra 
and beeja mantra are chanted 8 ti=
mes each and Atharva seersham once. You can 
of course use higher counts an=
d do it longer.

Thanks to Ravi for his effort!

Best regards,
Narasimha
