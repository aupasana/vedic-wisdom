name from the mail quoted below to keep your privacy. I hope this is ok wit=

Fantastic question. It is indeed the same Paramatman that express=
es as various objects of this universe, including various deities and vario=
us other beings. Blessed is the one who can see one's Ishta Devata in all o=
bjects of this universe and not let any so-called "unpleasant" object take =
one's mind away from Paramatman.
 
But that is not easy. It is easy to look=
 at various idols and various names and say "all these different forms are =
the same Paramatman only". But, when one confronts objects and situations t=
hat are quite "unpleasant", it is difficult to keep that state of mind and =
say "this too is Paramatman only". If one wants to see Paramatman in all ob=
jects, one should not distinguish between pleasure and pain, success and fa=
ilure, praise and criticism etc. If one gets cancer or a terrible disease, =
for example, and the body starts to pain badly, one should be able to see P=
aramatman in that disease, pain and suffering too. Of course, a great saint=
 like Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was capable of seeing Kaali in everything and=
 even a terrible throat cancer did not deter him or disturb his equanimity.=

 
But, how many can be like that? If health, wealth, family happiness, wel=
l-being of family members etc are very important to someone and one cannot =
withstand certain "unpleasant" situations with respect to those aspects, th=
en one is not really ready to see the same Paramatman in all. One is mired =
in duality/multiplicity then. The approach needed by such a person is diffe=
rent from that needed by a great saint who can be see the same Paramatman i=
n all people, places, times, objects and situations. Health or disease, wea=
lth or poverty, pleasure or pain, fame or censure, marital bliss or marital=
 discord, praise or criticism - such a Yogi sees no difference in all and s=
ees the same Paramatman in all. Such a Yogi looks at even the greatest suff=
ering as a gift of Krishna/Shiva and does not let it take one's mind off Pa=
ramatman. If such focus, one-pointedness and equanimity of mind is present,=
 then there is no need to worship various forms. One can just focus on Para=
matman. Such a soul is close to moksha. Various shastras like Jyotisha that=
 deal with how the maayaa of this world works are irrelevant to such a soul=
, as one is mostly beyond the grip of maaayaa.
 
But, one who sees pleasure=
 and pain, wealth and poverty, health and disease, fame and censure etc dif=
ferently is is in the tight grip of maayaa and hence shastras that shed lig=
ht on how the maayaa works are useful. Such a person may want to worship va=
rious forms (like grahas) for specific purposes. This can remove from one's=
 path obstacles like diseases, suffering, pain etc and create a situation t=
hat is conducive to doing sadhana to get a higher level of equanimity event=
ually and loosen the grip of maayaa after a lot of effort.
 
Hinduism is fu=
ll of teachings for people of various spiritual levels and one should take =
what is applicable to oneself. A sadguru can be helpful there.
 
> Your wor=
ds always give so much of clarity and reflect very good
> knowledge and und=
erstanding of  subtleties.
 
I am not saying this to sound humble, but I tr=
uly am merely a nimitta. If a crow sits on a coconut tree and a coconut fal=
ls from the tree just when the crow lands on the tree, one may think that t=
he crow actually broke the coconut. But it is a coincidence. This whole uni=
verse is so full of coincidences and the Mother is the manager of this whol=
e show. When I write something, She is the cause and manifestation of the d=
esire inside me to write, the knowledge inside me that drives the writing a=
nd my action of writing. She is also the cause and manifestation of the des=
ire inside the reader to understand something from the written words, the a=
ction of reading and understanding the written words and the knowledge that=
 comes out in the reader after reading. She does everything, through Her va=
rious forms and manifestations. If somebody egoistically feels proud thinki=
ng that *he* did something, even that veil of ego is Her manifestation only=
. As one understands and unravels one level of Her manifestation, She shows=
 the next level.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

Dea=
r Narasimhaji,
                         Your words always give so much of c=
larity and reflect very good knowledge and understanding of  subtleties.
Sp=
ecifically you talked about Grahas gripping our consciousness. There is one=
 point where there seems to be a contradiction, in the way things have been=
 understood by me. 
In pure bhakthi, one-pointed devotion is talked about. =
Similarly it is talked of as an important step towards realizing the self. =
Proceeding on these lines, a specific deity (and that deity alone) occupies=
 a person's mind and life; as in Mira's case or Tulsidas case where they sp=
oke and thought of none but their chosen deity. Although there is tolerance=
 to all deities, the japa/sadhana is  directed  at one form in this case.
O=
n the other hand, as has  been well established, all forms are nothing but =
the same paramthman. Then what is one supposed to do.  Can we with the unde=
rstanding that each deity is essentially the same paramathman continue to w=
orship the  different deities. Should there be any difference in worshippin=
g different forms or one form given that all are the same paramathman's for=
m? It is here that the approach of astrology seems to be different  where d=
epending on dasa bukthi/ gochara an appropriate mantra/ sadhana is suggeste=
d. Is it fine if the sadhana keeps changing over time?
 
Your perspective o=
n this is appreciated.
 
Thank You,
