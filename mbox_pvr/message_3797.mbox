Namaste,

I have a few basic queries. 
=C2=
=A0
What is the line between control and gratification? Everything, it is s=
aid, is a Rna. If there is a Rna, can it be avoided? My=C2=A0limited=C2=A0u=
nderstanding of Karma says in this law there is no mercy, but only action/r=
eaction. Either you pay the rna or you burn the rna through sadhana. 
=C2=
=A0
So, if an individual is indulging in any kind of sense pleasure (sex fo=
r example) is he/she merely fullfilling his/her Rna, or in the process is h=
e/she creating new Rnas? If he/she has to=C2=A0 fullfillingf the Rna, how c=
an control ever work? Every debt has to be paid. And how does one know the =
fine line between paying debt and creating a new one?
=C2=A0
If by exercisi=
ng ones will power, an individual is able to avoid paying a rna, what happe=
ns then? Will the Mother force the soul to reincarnate only to pay off that=
 debt? And in that case what happens to the debts that soul has/had with ot=
her souls during past lives?
=C2=A0
Karma is too complex!

Namaste,
=C2=

It is perfectly fine to combine the sadhanas of different aspects of th=
e Mother, including Lalita and Chandi.
=C2=A0
Sri Vidya consists of symboli=
c practices that eventually enable one to understand various layers of Maay=
aa surrounding true Self. The idea is that one is not bound by Maayaa once =
one *fully* understands and appreciates it.
=C2=A0
Chandipath consists of s=
ymbolic stories of wars that the divine Mother fought, which explain how on=
e can fight and overcome various weaknesses that typically bind one in Maay=
aa. Reciting these stories on a regular basis will promote the fighting spi=
rit within one that fights these weaknesses.
=C2=A0
There is nothing wrong =
in understanding Maayaa and trying to fight/overcome it at the same time. O=
ne aspect of the Mother creates Maayaa. One aspect of the Mother makes you =
experience good and bad in that Maayaa. One aspect of the Mother makes you =
understand Maayaa to overcome it. One aspect of the Mother makes you fight =
and overcome it. When one realizes Self at the end, irrespective of the pat=
h taken, one finally sees that all these are aspects of a Single Mother who=

=C2=A0
Aghora series books by Svoboda are good, but Aghora is not everyon=
e's cup of tea. It is normal to have mixed feelings.
=C2=A0
Ghora means ter=
rible. Aghora means "not terrible". One of the names of Lord Shiva is Aghor=
a. A true=C2=A0Aghora (aghori) does not see anything as terrible or bad or =
impure and sees all as impermanent manifestations of god and tries to focus=
 the thinking of the mind on what is permanent (god) always, instead of imp=
ermanent manifestations of god.
=C2=A0
When someone dies, north Indians cha=
nt "Raama naam satya hai" while carrying the dead body to the funeral. It m=
eans "only the name of Lord Rama is true and everything else is an illusion=
". The idea is to remind oneself that life and death are just a temporary i=
llusion and only the Lord is real. But the question is: why should we remin=
d ourselves of this ultimate truth only when someone dies? When someone pra=
ises us for a supposedly great thing we have done and we are about to feel =
proud and happy, can't we tell ourselves "Raama naam satya hai. This thing =
we did and the praises are temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let =
the mind not dwell on temporary illusions"? When we feel attracted to somet=
hing beautiful and want to get it, can't we tell ourselves "Raama naam saty=
a hai. This thing that seems beautiful and other things that seem not so be=
autiful are temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dw=
ell on temporary illusions"?
 When someone attacks and abuses us and we are=
 about to feel sad or angry, can't we tell ourselves "Raama naam satya hai.=
 These abuses are temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind =
not dwell on temporary illusions"?"
=C2=A0
A true Aghora's mind thinks "Raa=
ma naam satya hai" always. His mind rejects all *impermanent manifestations=
* of Lord (instead of *dwelling* on them by classifying them as pure and im=
pure, good and bad etc and thinking about them with attraction/aversion ) a=
nd tries to find and focus on what is permanent. But he takes it to extreme=
s.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Vedanta says "all is Self. The variety we=
 perceive is an illusion". An aghora pursues it practically. If feces and f=
ruit are both impermenant illusions and the only permanent reality within t=
hem is the Self, he questions why he can eat fruit but not feces. So he may=
 try a ritual where feces is eaten.=C2=A0But, please remember that eating f=
eces is not the main point. Perceiving Self in the food being consumed and =
not perceiving an impermanent manifestation of Self (feces, fruit etc), is =
the main point. For example, eating feces with disgust serves no purpose, f=
or such a person's mind is dwelling on the impermenant manifestation of Sel=
f ("feces") while eating it. A successful Aghora may be eating feces, but t=
he mind will not be dwelling on the fact that he is eating "feces" with cer=
tain properties and will not feel any kind of disgust. He will be thinking =
that he is Self and he is eating Self.
=C2=A0
Of course, a vedantin also ha=
s the same notions really. He chants vedic verses when eating food, which e=
ssentially mean "I am Self and I am consuming Self". Nevertheless, such cha=
nting may merely be a ritual and not be fully absorbed in one's thinking. A=
s he eats, his mind may dwell on the impermanant manifestations of Self ("a=
 tasty laddu", "a badly cooked brinjal curry", "a overly salty cracker" etc=
) and waver from the focus on the permanent (Self).
=C2=A0
Thus, a vedantin=
 and an aghora are telling themselves the same truth and trying to absorb t=
hat truth into every thought and impulse. But aghora is putting himself in =
an extreme situation where failure results in a very bad dual experience. T=
hat can in fact work as an incentive in forcing one to transcend duality! I=
n the case of a person who chants a Vedic verse that says "I am Self and I =
am consuming Self" and eats tasty laddus and nicely made food, the fallout =
from failing to absorb the mind in Self while eating is not too bad. If the=
 mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice) taste of a laddu or other fo=
od, what is the big deal? On the other hand, if the mind fails to absorb in=
 Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it will be so disgusting. Thus, the=
 fact that failure results in a very bad dual experience may act as an ince=
ntive in succeeding quickly.
=C2=A0
However, difficult tasks cannot necessa=
rily be accomplished by everyone merely because of an incentive. Not everyo=
ne trying Aghora sadhanas succeeds.

=C2=A0
Take anot=
her simple example. Suppose someone is doing a lot of sadhana, like japam a=
nd homam, and yet having a weakness for sex. Suppose one's mind is dwelling=
 on sex or getting sexual thoughts in the middle of sadhana and that is cau=
sing guilt and blocking one's sadhana.
=C2=A0
A regular person will try to =
enforce celibacy and keep the mind away from sexual thoughts. But that is n=
or a formula for overcoming such thoughts. After all, such thoughts may sti=
ll come and distract one. Even if one keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is=
 no guarantee that the fascination in the mind does not return to bite one =
after that. But, how to overcome the fascination some minds may have for se=
x?
=C2=A0
An aghora will take it to an extreme. He will try to fix the root=
 cause and remove fascination from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and=
 sex as two different activities (one pure and the other impure), he may co=
mbine them into one without such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an=
 aghora sits naked with his partner sitting naked on his lap and then does =
his japam. In the beginning, this may titillate and result in sex. He may t=
hink that his sadhana is being made impure. But, suppose he persists to do =
japam like that for several months/years. Eventually, mind may be reprogram=
med. He may no longer feel that he is doing something impure. He may no lon=
ger feel titillation. The association in his mind between nakedness and sex=
 may be broken down. Seeing naked pictures physically or mentally may no lo=
nger evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of meditation. Any small tho=
ughts related to sex that suddenly rise in the head may not lead to denser =
and
 denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in sadhana, but they m=
ay now take the mind back to meditation. After spending so much time in med=
itation while sitting naked intimately, the attraction and thrill mind may =
feel for nakedness or intimacy may be broken down. Overall, the person's fa=
scination and weakness for sex may be gone largely.
=C2=A0
Mind has a lot o=
f conditioning based on prior experiences and the thoughts we are exposed t=
o. Aghora sometimes tries to break down some of these structures by engagin=
g in certain practices that undermine those structures.
=C2=A0
However, is =
this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is also possible that the person k=
eeps on engaging in the practice merely for sex and thinks of sex everytime=
 he sits for meditation (instead of thinking of meditation everytime he see=
s naked partner), if one was not serious/sincere/ ready to start with.

=C2=A0Bottomline is that an aghora takes problems and =

=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0Like Manish said in a mail earlier, "what is Vedanta and =
what is Aghora"? Aghora is merely a practical way to understand and absorb =
Vedanta in one's thought process, by setting up a high stakes war plan. How=
ever, it is certainly not suitable for all and many may feel aversion. More=
 dangerously, some people may feel attraction for it based on a wrong under=
standing and the thrill such an understanding brings.=C2=A0Aghora stands fo=
r neither thrills nor perversion, though it *may* attract some people pursu=
ing thrills and/or perversion. The basic tenets of Aghora and Vedanta/Upani=
shads are the same, but Aghora tries to accelerates how one absorbs the tru=
th into one's thinking by making failure very unpleasant.
=C2=A0
BTW, the f=
ollowing mail gives a good analogy for various spiritual paths and explains=
 the basic reality. It may be interesting to read in the context of aghora.=

=A0But what I am trying to understand=C2=A0is that how to worship both form=
s simultaneously. For=C2=A0instance, Sri Muththuswamy Diskshitar, was a gre=
at composer (one of the Divine Trinity of Carnatic Music along with Thyagar=
aja and Shyama Sastry), who was a self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka. His Kamala=
mba Navavarna Krithis=C2=A0mention=C2=A0great details about all the=C2=A0ni=

ch avarana.=C2=A0In the Dhyana Krithi=C2=A0of those, in the very=C2=A0first=
 line he says, 'Kamalambike, AsRta kalpalatike, ChanDike'.=C2=A0That line t=
ells me that=C2=A0even through Sri Vidya one can worship Chandi Ma, in that=
 form.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
So my question was in that perspective. Anyway, your re=
ply was a great one in which you mentioned how the Self is surrounded by la=
yers of duality! I never thought in those terms. 
=C2=A0
I have started rea=
ding Durga Saptashati, just to get practise of reading it fluently, before =
I start to do chandi homam, which I plan to do during navaratri of 2010. I =
really cannot wait to get comfortable reading the saptashati! Have to see h=
ow mother will help me achieve my target.

Also, I have started to r=

Namaste,

Sanskrit is almost like a mother to=
ngue to me. My performing a Chandi homam everyday should hardly be awe-insp=
iring. On the other hand, there are some people who do not know Sanskrit at=
 all and took 4 hours to read Chandipath with great difficulty in their fir=
st attempt. THEY are doing Chandi homam everyday and it takes them 1.5 hour=
s now. THAT is awe-inspiring.

Integrating various sadhanas is a personal p=
roblem that needs a personal solution. In general, it is a good idea to pic=
k one or two sadhanas and maximize the time spent on them, instead of split=
ting the time between ten things. As Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, it is be=
tter to dig 10 metres in one place rather than dig one metre in ten places,=
 if one wants to find water.

One possibility is to do a homam and then med=
itate at the end after poornaahuti with various mantras one is attached to.=


I am not that knowledgeable about Sri Vidya. However, from the little I h=
ave been exposed to, Sree chakra is a symblic representation of the layers =
of duality surrounding Self. Its purpose, too, is to unravel the layer of d=
uality and realize Self.

Lalita means gentle one and Chandi means the fier=
ce one. If you have a mother who teaches you gently, you will learn slowly.=
 If you have a mother who is stern and strict, you will learn fast (provide=
d you can face the strictness). Both are valid paths.

Best regards,
Narasi=

Dear Sri Narasimh=
arao garu,

I am very much in awe after I learnt that you do chandi homam e=
veryday. You also wrote that it takes about 1.25 hours to 1.5 hours to do y=
our chandi homam. How can you accomplish that feat with 700 ahutis in such =
a short time? Also, in my case, I do sandhyavandanam with 108 Gayatri (20 m=
inutes)+ganapathi mantra japam 108 times(10 minutes), a short rudra Abhishe=
kam with pachakshari, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 minutes) totalling to about=
 35 - 40 minutes daily ritual. Plus I sometimes do special rituals several =
times a week, that takes about 1 to 1.5 hours in all. How to integrate thes=
e along with homam? Is Sri vidyopasana different from Chandi homam? Could y=
ou please explain what is sri Vidya and how it is to be learnt? I am very m=
otivated to learn what the Devi Mahatmayam is all about but I also have kee=
n interest in Sri Vidya, because I am a musician also and learnt all the na=
va-avarna krithis of Great Muththuswami Dikshitar recently.

<DIV> </=

<DIV>What is the line between control and gratification? Everything, i=

nbsp;understanding of Karma says in this law there is no mercy, but only ac=
tion/reaction. Either you pay the rna or you burn the rna through sadhana. =
</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>So, if an individual is indulging in any kind=
 of sense pleasure (sex for example) is he/she merely fullfilling his/her R=
na, or in the process is he/she creating new Rnas? If he/she has to  f=
ullfillingf the Rna, how can control ever work? Every debt has to be paid. =
And how does one know the fine line between paying debt and creating a new =
one?</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>If by exercising ones will power, an indi=
vidual is able to avoid paying a rna, what happens then? Will the Mother fo=
rce the soul to reincarnate only to pay off that debt? And in that case wha=
t happens to the debts that soul has/had with other souls during past lives=

<DIV>Dear Narasimha and others,</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Just furthe=
r to our conversation on this topic last night,</DIV>
<DIV>If one looks int=
o the mind, one finds that sex is associated with naked men/women, etc. The=
 mind perceives a woman or man of the opposite sex in a different way. This=
 comes from millions of janmas and samskaras. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV=
>My spiritual father "Vimalananda" used to say in a slightly different=
 context that he believes in Sampradaha or incineration.</DIV>
<DIV>I appli=
ed it to this as well and it works quite well. </DIV>
<DIV>Two things&=
nbsp;are going to be useful, </DIV>
<DIV>1. Continue your mantra durin=
g the act and it will act as a continuation of your sadhana.</DIV>
<DIV>2. =
If your partner is willing, use Shiva lata and do not be disheartened by fa=
ilure initially. As time goes on, the thing in your mind which thinks =
of sex is incinerated and slowly you find that a naked female(or male as&nb=
sp;may be the case) body is like a landscape picture just like any oth=
er picture made by Her of nature(like Niagara falls, or Angkor Wat, you nee=
d not be disturbed by it, you can certainly feel that the picture =
;is very beautiful but you need not be aroused by it). In fact Striya =
Samasta Sakala jagatsu, tyaikiya.... ...</DIV>
<DIV>Once this stage is reac=
hed then the mind ceases to think of sex all the while.</DIV>
<DIV>Yes you =
may still encounter it, but that is another story.</DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Vedanta says "all is Self. The=
 variety we perceive is an illusion". An aghora pursues it practically. If =
feces and fruit are both impermenant illusions and the only permanent reali=
ty within them is the Self, he questions why he can eat fruit but not feces=
. So he may try a ritual where feces is eaten. </FONT><FONT face=3DAri=
al size=3D2>But, please remember that eating feces is not the main point. P=
erceiving Self in the food being consumed and not perceiving an impermanent=
 manifestation of Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main point. For example, =
eating feces with disgust serves no purpose, for such a person's mind is dw=
elling on the impermenant manifestation of Self ("feces") while eating it. =
A successful Aghora may be eating feces, but the mind will not be dwelling =
on the fact that he is eating "feces" with certain properties and will not =
feel any kind of disgust. He will be thinking that he is Self and he is eat=
ing
 Self.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV=
>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Of course, a vedantin also has the same =
notions really. He chants vedic verses when eating food, which essentially =
mean "I am Self and I am consuming Self". Nevertheless, such chanting may m=
erely be a ritual and not be fully absorbed in one's thinking. As he eats, =
his mind may dwell on the impermanant manifestations of Self ("a tasty ladd=
u", "a badly cooked brinjal curry", "a overly salty cracker" etc) and waver=
 from the focus on the permanent (Self).</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DAri=
al size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Thus, a ve=
dantin and an aghora are telling themselves the same truth and trying to ab=
sorb that truth into every thought and impulse. But aghora is putting himse=
lf in an extreme situation where failure results in a very bad dual experie=
nce. That can in fact work as an incentive in forcing one to transcend dual=
ity! In the case of a person who chants a Vedic verse that says "I am Self =
and I am consuming Self" and eats tasty laddus and nicely made food, the fa=
llout from failing to absorb the mind in Self while eating is not too bad. =
If the mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice) taste of a laddu or ot=
her food, what is the big deal? On the other hand, if the mind fails to abs=
orb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it will be so disgusting. Thu=
s, the fact that failure results in a very bad dual experience may act as a=
n incentive in succeeding quickly.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial siz=
e=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>However, difficu=

 </DIV>
<DIV>Take another simple example. Suppose someone is doing a l=
ot of sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet having a weakness for sex. Sup=
pose one's mind is dwelling on sex or getting sexual thoughts in the middle=
 of sadhana and that is causing guilt and blocking one's sadhana.</DIV>
<DI=
V> </DIV>
<DIV>A regular person will try to enforce celibacy and keep =
the mind away from sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula for overcomin=
g such thoughts. After all, such thoughts may still come and distract one. =
Even if one keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is no guarantee that the fas=
cination in the mind does not return to bite one after that. But, how to ov=
ercome the fascination some minds may have for sex?</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>=

<DIV>An aghora will take it to an extreme. He will try to fix the root cau=
se and remove fascination from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and sex=
 as two different activities (one pure and the other impure), he may combin=
e them into one without such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an agh=
ora sits naked with his partner sitting naked on his lap and then does his =
japam. In the beginning, this may titillate and result in sex. He may think=
 that his sadhana is being made impure. But, suppose he persists to do japa=
m like that for several months/years. Eventually, mind may be reprogrammed.=
 He may no longer feel that he is doing something impure. He may no longer =
feel titillation. The association in his mind between nakedness and sex may=
 be broken down. Seeing naked pictures physically or mentally may no longer=
 evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of meditation. Any small thought=
s related to sex that suddenly rise in the head may not lead to
 denser and=
 denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in sadhana, but they may n=
ow take the mind back to meditation. After spending so much time in meditat=
ion while sitting naked intimately, the attraction and thrill mind may feel=
 for nakedness or intimacy may be broken down. Overall, the person's fascin=
ation and weakness for sex may be gone largely.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DI=
V>Mind has a lot of conditioning based on prior experiences and the thought=
s we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break down some of these str=
uctures by engaging in certain practices that undermine those structures.</=
DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>However, is this a fool-proof method? Not reall=
y. It is also possible that the person keeps on engaging in the practice me=
rely for sex and thinks of sex everytime he sits for meditation (instead of=
 thinking of meditation everytime he sees naked partner), if one was not se=
rious/sincere/ ready to start with.</DIV>

<DIV> </DIV>Bottom=
line is that an aghora takes problems and weaknesses head on and sets up a =

under the carpet and fight slowly and with low stakes. Such a risky strateg=

<DIV> </DIV>Like Manish said in a mail earlier, "what is Vedanta a=
nd what is Aghora"? Aghora is merely a practical way to understand and abso=
rb Vedanta in one's thought process, by setting up a high stakes war plan. =
However, it is certainly not suitable for all and many may feel aversion. M=
ore dangerously, some people may feel attraction for it based on a wrong un=
derstanding and the thrill such an understanding brings. Aghora stands=
 for neither thrills nor perversion, though it *may* attract some people pu=
rsuing thrills and/or perversion. The basic tenets of Aghora and Vedanta/Up=
anishads are the same, but Aghora tries to accelerates how one absorbs the =
truth into one's thinking by making failure very unpleasant.</DIV>

<DIV>BTW, the following mail gives a good analogy for various spi=
ritual paths and explains the basic reality. It may be interesting to read =
in the context of aghora.</DIV>

<DIV>Dear Narasimhagaru,</DIV>
<DIV><F=
ONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>Thank you for your reply=
. </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>I understand that=
 Chandi and Lalita are two different forms of the Universal Mother. Bu=
t what I am trying to understand is that how to worship both forms sim=
ultaneously. For instance, Sri Muththuswamy Diskshitar, was a great co=
mposer (one of the Divine Trinity of Carnatic Music along with Thyagaraja a=
nd Shyama Sastry), who was a self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka. His Kamalamba N=
avavarna Krithis mention great details about all the nine av=
aranas and different forms of the divine mother as one goes through each av=
arana. In the Dhyana Krithi of those, in the very first line=
 he says, 'Kamalambike, AsRta kalpalatike, ChanDike'. That line tells =
me that even through Sri Vidya one can worship Chandi Ma, in that form=
. </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>So my questi=
on was in that perspective. Anyway, your reply was a great one in which you=
 mentioned how the Self is surrounded by layers of duality! I never thought=
 in those terms. </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>I =
have started reading Durga Saptashati, just to get practise of reading it f=
luently, before I start to do chandi homam, which I plan to do during navar=
atri of 2010. I really cannot wait to get comfortable reading the saptashat=
i! Have to see how mother will help me achieve my target. </DIV>
<DIV><FONT=
 face=3DArial></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>Also, I have started to read the Agh=
ora series books by Dr. Robert Svobodha. For now I have very mixed feelings=
 on the subject. Perhaps I need to read more! </DIV>

<DIV>Namaste,<BR><BR>Sanskrit is almost like a mother t=

sonal problem that needs a personal solution. In general, it is a good idea=
 to pick one or two sadhanas and maximize the time spent on them, instead o=
f splitting the time between ten things. As Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, i=
t is better to dig 10 metres in one place rather than dig one metre in ten =
places, if one wants to find water.<BR><BR>One possibility is to do a homam=
 and then meditate at the end after poornaahuti with various mantras one is=
 attached to.<BR><BR>I am not that knowledgeable about Sri Vidya. However, =
from the
 little I have been exposed to, Sree chakra is a symblic represent=
ation of the layers of duality surrounding Self. Its purpose, too, is to un=
ravel the layer of duality and realize Self.<BR><BR>Lalita means gentle one=
 and Chandi means the fierce one. If you have a mother who teaches you gent=
ly, you will learn slowly. If you have a mother who is stern and strict, yo=
u will learn fast (provided you can face the strictness). Both are valid pa=

so wrote that it takes about 1.25 hours to 1.5 hours to do your chandi homa=
m. How can you accomplish that feat with 700 ahutis in such a short time? A=
lso, in my case, I do sandhyavandanam with 108 Gayatri (20 minutes)+ganapat=
hi mantra japam 108 times(10 minutes), a short rudra Abhishekam with pachak=
shari, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 minutes) totalling to about 35 - 40 minute=
s daily ritual. Plus I sometimes do special rituals several times a week, t=
hat takes about 1 to 1.5 hours in all. How to integrate these along with ho=
mam? Is Sri vidyopasana different from Chandi homam? Could you please expla=
in what is sri Vidya
 and how it is to be learnt? I am very motivated to le=
arn what the Devi Mahatmayam is all about but I also have keen interest in =
Sri Vidya, because I am a musician also and learnt all the nava-avarna krit=
