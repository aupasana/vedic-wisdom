Dear Ramadas ji,
 
> So why we have to cut short the methods ?
 
If I tell =
someone to make a twenty course meal and eat it, one will be able to make i=
t only once in a blue moon. If one eats a delicious feast once every year o=
r six months and starves at other times, what good is it? Will it give one =
much strength?
 
On the other hand, if I tell someone to boil lentils (dal)=
 and rice and eat them with a pinch of salt, one will be able to make it ev=
eryday and eat it. It may not be too delicious, but it will taste good and =
will give one strength for sure.
 
The instruction we received was to sprea=
d a very simple Mahaganapathi homam procedure that can be done everyday by =
busy people of this age. Homam is a very efficient sadhana. Everything is i=
mpure in kali yuga, but fire is always pure. Worshipping Ganapathi in fire =
every morning has an amazing cleansing effect on one. However, any spiritua=
l sadhana needs regularity for effectiveness.
 
I have performed long homas=
, like an 8-hour long Mahaganapathi homam and a 12-hour long Chandi homam. =
I have also performed short homas on a regular basis, like a 45-minute long=
 daily Mahaganapathi homam and a 2-hour long daily Chandi homam. My experie=
nce is that a regular practice does much more to one than a one-off biggie.=

 
BTW, the 45 minute long "short" procedure I taught in the manual is quit=
e close to an authentic and perfect procedure. Regarding the 15-20 minute l=
ong "super-short" procedure, we too are not too excited by it. But we feel =
that something is better than nothing and that this will be a stepping ston=
e to the other 45-minute procedure for a lot of people that are going to co=
me and benefit from homam.
 
So many saintly souls are born into challengin=
g circumstances in this age and a great amount of bad karmas is accumulated=
 in the mad rush of this age. The amount of sadhana that is needed to burn =
those karmas is difficult to manage within the limited time most people all=
ocate to spiritual sadhana in this age. Worship using an external fire is o=
f great help and accelerates the process of burning karmas and cleansing se=
lf.
 
Some higher beings have decided that several spiritually inclined sou=
ls are to come to earth in the coming years and benefit from a regular prac=
tice of Mahaganapathi homam. They instructed my guru to spread a short Maha=
ganapathi homam procedure. The divine Mother also appeared to him and clari=
fied that instruction. We are just laying the foundation as per the instruc=
tion received by us. We are just instruments in a big plan. The reason for =
the instruction we received may become clearer after more time.
 
The proof=
 of the pudding is in eating it. If one tries a procedure given in the manu=
al for a few months, one will know what it does.
 
By the way, I have no pr=
oblem with people doing longer procedures at all. There are many traditions=
 and many procedures. While we are here to spread one particular procedure,=
 we do respect all traditions.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
