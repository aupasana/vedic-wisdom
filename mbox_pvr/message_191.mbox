Dear Kiran ji,

Drigdasa is not based on divisional charts and it is based natal rasi chart 
only.

Of course!

Thanks for your understanding, but I am afraid it is far more involved. 
While the 9th house of dharma IS relevant for spiritual progress, that is 
not all. The 5th house of mantra, 8th house of sadhana, the 12th house of 
detachment, 3rd house of interaction with guru, 6th house of siddhis cannot 
be ignored. Rasi, navamsa and vimsamsa charts are all important. In any 
case, I do not want to turn this list into an astrology discussion group. 
There are other forums for astrology.

Best regards,
Narasimha
