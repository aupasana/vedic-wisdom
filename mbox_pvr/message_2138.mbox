Namaste,
 
Veda is for self-realization. Veda deals with various aspects of=
 dual and non-dual self. There are hardly any good translations or commenta=
ries on Veda in today's world. Aurobindo's commentary (on a small number of=
 riks) is the only intelligent commentary I have come across.
 
Just as Adi=
 Sankara devoted his life to commenting on some Upanishads, someone like hi=
m needs to come and devote life to commenting on Veda, if we are to have a =
good commentary. Actually, Vivekananda commented on his last day (1902 July=
 4) on the commentaries on Veda. He had his disciples read a verse from Suk=
la Yajur Veda, read the commentary by Mahidhara and said that Mahidhara's i=
nterpretation did not appeal to his mind. He connected the verse to some la=
ter day tantra concepts and wished that his disciples would make an attempt=
 at fresh independent interpretation of mantras from Veda, as the existing =
commentaries were not good. This was one of the last few desires expressed =
by Vivekananda before he gave up his body.
 
Aurobindo said that he had a v=
ision of Vivekananda in his prison cell and that Vivekananda explained some=
 things to him. It is interesting that Aurobindo came up with a sublime com=
mentary on some Vedic verses in later years.
 
*        *        *
 
Do not=
 trust any commentary on Veda. More so the one at the website you mentioned=
. I checked out a few verses. The translations given by them are usually qu=
ite silly. Ignore that website.
 
*        *        *
 
Commenting on a ver=
se from Veda is different. It is not merely an intellectual activity requir=
ing scholarship and logical thinking.
 
I cannot give a complete sense of w=
hat this verse is saying (will try later), but can give an overall big pict=
ure first. The verses around this verse alternate between having Pururava a=
s the rishi (seer) and Urvashi as the devata (deity) and having Urvashi as =
the rishi (deity) and Pururava as the devata (deity). This is an exchange b=
etween Pururava and Urvashi as they pursued each other. You can read variou=
s puranic stories about Pururava, the great king from Chandra vamsha, and U=
rvashi, the beautiful apsara (celestial nymph). They were attracted to each=
 other and lived together on earth. They are personifications of some quali=
ties inside us.
 
Urvashi comes from ura and vasha. It means one who has th=
e power to control and pull the heart. Urvashi is personification of the at=
traction that pulls one's heart towards various objects in the field of dua=
lity. As a sadhaka does great tapascharya and starts to overcome duality, U=
rvashi is sent to test one. Urvashi successfully seducing a sadhaka and dis=
turbing his tapascharya means that the sadhaka succumbed to the power of at=
traction that pulled his heart towards objects and his heart desired someth=
ing.
 
Pururava means a crying a lot or crying majestically. He is a person=
ification of the emotional nature and compassion within us. No wonder he is=
 a king in the Chandra vamsha. The solar and lunar lineages that are popula=
r in the scriptures have to do with the solar and lunar channels - Pingala =
and Ida (respectively). Ida nadi is the channel of emotions, intuition, fee=
ling, compassion etc. So Pururava is from that lineage.
 
While everyone is=
 charmed by Urvashi - the power of attraction that binds one's heart, Urvas=
hi herself was charmed by Pururava, the majestic and noble king. Pururava r=
escued Urvashi from a demon once. The majestic and noble quality of compass=
ion saves the power of attraction from having to combine with meaner motive=
s. One's heart can be pulled towards various objects out of the spirit of s=
elf-gratification (a demon) or out of kindness and compassion (Pururava). W=
hen compassion arises in one's heart, then the heart's attraction to others=
 is driven by compassion rather than the spirit of self-gratification.
 
Th=
e verses you referred to are a dialog between the personification of compas=
sion and personification of the power of attraction that pulls one's heart =
towards various objects. This whole series of verses has to be interpreted =
in abstract and internalized terms. It is not a commentary on men and women=
 at all.
 
More later..
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

        Dear Narasimhaji and others

        Can you kindly explain =
the meaning of the following verse from the Rig Veda:

        pur=C5=ABrav=

    =
    http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rvsan/rv10095.htm

        The english =
translation provided is as follows:

        15 Nay, do not die, Pur=C5=ABr=
avas, nor vanish: let not the evil-omened wolves devour thee.
        With =
women there can be no lasting friendship: hearts of hyenas are the hearts o=
f women.

        http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv10095.htm

    =
    Is this translation correct? If so, then is this a negative comment on =
all women?

        -Regards
         Rajarshi
