Namaste friends,
 
I want to share my 2 cents on this topic based on what I=
 realized from my personal experience. More learned ones can ignore my 2 ce=
nts.
 
*        *        *
 
Though I offer this navarna mantra in fire bef=
ore and after saptashati everyday as a part of my daily Chandi homam, I did=
 not have an attachment to this mantra and did not appreciate what it repre=
sented. I could appreciate the outward and inward meanings of the stories o=
f saptashati, but I was clueless on the navarna mantra and was offering it =
in fire merely ritually. In contrast, I was (and am) quite attached to [Sav=
itru] Gayatri mantra, meditated with it a lot more, had many experiences wi=
th it and had a much better understanding of it. Even when meditating at th=
e end of Chandi homam as the poornaahuti burnt, I always used Gayatri mantr=
a rather than navarna mantra.
 
When I was at the Dakshineshwar temple in 2=
008 summer with my spiritual guru, somehow I felt a strong urge to meditate=
 with the navarna mantra and did so. The Mother was kind and I could experi=
ence some things and some things became clear about that mantra.
 
I realiz=
ed through experience that navarna mantra is not that different from Savitr=
u Gayatri mantra! It is actually a slightly different expression of the sam=
e reality, even though this may sound strange to some.
 
*        *        =
*
 
Those who do homam know the following mantras from the uttaraangam: "OM=
 bhUH svaahaa - agnaya idam na mama, OM bhuvH svaahaa - vaayava idam na mam=
a, OM suvaH svaahaa - sUryaayedam na mama". Note that the planes of conscio=
usness represented by bhUH, bhuvaH and suvaH (physical, mental and spiritua=
l planes or, using alternate terminology, gross, subtle and causal realms) =
are associated with Fire (Agni), Wind (Vaayu) and Sun (Surya) gods. After a=
ll, it is Fire who transforms and transmutes things and enables physical ma=
tter to come from aakaasa (space); it is Wind that causes motion and though=
ts in the mind; and, it is Sun who fills the entire universe and each being=
 in it with the essence that soul is.
 
In Chandipath (i.e. saptashati), we=
 have 3 charitras for which Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati are the=
 devatas. The beejas associated with the 3 charitras are Aim, Hreem and Kle=
em respectively. And, Agni, Vaayu and Surya are mentioned as the tattwa (es=
sence) of the three charitras respectively!
 
In other words, the 3 beejas =
aim, hreem and kleem that start the navarna mantra are associated with Agni=
, Vaayu and Surya, who also represents the realms of bhUh, bhuvaH and suvaH=
. Basically, "aim hreem kleem" in navarna mantra similar to "om bhurbhuvass=
uvah" that is usually appended to the Gayatri mantra.
 
The word "vid" that=
 is part of "vichche" (vid + cha + ee) is an expression of "dhiyo yo nah pr=
achodayat". The word "ee" that is part of "vichche" is an expression of "bh=
argo devasya dheemahi".
 
*        *        *
 
The difference between nava=
rna mantra and Gayatri mantra is in one way like the difference between Bha=
gavad Gita and Avadhoota Gita or Ashtavakra Gita.
 
Avadhoota Gita by Datta=
treya and Ashtavakra Gita by Ashtavakra (taught to king Janaka) are fantast=
ic vedantic texts that throw light on the state of a liberated being. Bhaga=
vad Gita taught by Sri Krishna also does the same thing. However, the diffe=
rence is that Bhagavad Gita shows practical paths that one can follow in or=
der to be liberated. Of course, if you can imbibe the thinking described in=
 Avadhoota Gita or Ashtavakra Gita also, you can become liberated. But, it =
is not easy for most people to imbibe that thinking just like that. Bhagava=
d Gita shows a more practical and realistic path.
 
Similarly, Gayatri mant=
ra refers to the resplendent spiritual essence of the entire universe (gros=
s, subtle and causal) and asks us to know it and be established in it. Nava=
rna mantra is also referring to resplendent spiritual essence of the entire=
 universe (gross, subtle and causal) and asking us to know it and be establ=
ished in its resplendence. But, in addition, it is giving us a realistic pa=
th (chaamundaayai) to achieving such a state of sat-chid-aananda from the d=
eeply dual state that we are in. Except for that additional recognition of =
deep duality and showing a path towards realization, it basically expresses=
 the same realization captured in the Gayatri mantra.
 
*        *        *=

 
To answer the specific question on which deity this navarna mantra is fo=
r, my answer is that it is for the root energy (aadyaa shakti) of this univ=
erse, that makes every being - including Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva - be, hav=
e desires, think, know, act etc. This root energy is essentially the Shakti=
 of the Supreme Cosmic Being (Parama Purusha). In saptashati rahasya, She i=
s described thus:
 
sarvasyaadyaa mahaalakShmIstriguNaa parameshvarI
lakShy=
aalakShya svarUpaa saa vyaapya kR^itsnam vyavasthitaa
maatulungam gadaam kh=
eTam paanapaatram cha bibhratI
naagaM liMgaM cha yonim cha bibhratI nR^ipam=
Urdhani
tapta kaaMchana varNaabhaa tapta kaaMchana bhUShaNaa
shUnyam tadakh=
ilam svena pUrayaamaasa tejasaa
 
This describes that Mahalakshmi of 3 guna=
s was the first of all beings and supreme of all beings. She filled the ent=
ire universe with Her shakti. The rahasya further describes that She divide=
d Herself into 3 deities - Mahaakaali, Mahaalakshmi and Mahaasaraswati - sy=
mbolizing the 3 gunas. They then created Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva and their co=
nsorts.
 
Of course, one can question whether this aadyaa shakti is the fir=
st of all beings as the verse above says or whether it should be Parama Pur=
usha that is the first of all beings. The answer is that they are not actua=
lly two different beings, even though we tend to look at them that way. It =
is the Aadyaa shakti that makes Parama Purusha (or Aadya purusha) be, think=
, desire, know and act. Without Aadyaa shakti, Aadya purusha has no thought=
s, no desires, no knowledge and no action, i.e. he is non-different from un=
manifested Brahman. His very self-awareness is through Aadyaa shakti, just =
as my self-awareness is through my Kundalini.
 
Thus, Aadyaa shakti and Par=
ama purusha are not really two different beings, but two different aspects =
of one being. Narayana and Narayani are one.
 
*        *        *
 
One wo=
rd on intellectual analysis of mantras:
 
One can get only a very limited u=
nderstanding of mantras by analyzing them and understanding them intellectu=
ally. One can realize and understand the nature of a mantra through an inte=
rnal experience of the mantra. One should focus the mind so completely on t=
he mantra that one's mind is eventually withdrawn from everything else, inc=
luding one's body and sense inputs, and reverberates with the mantra with a=
bsolutely no other thoughts running in the mind. When the mantra *fills* on=
e's mind like this, one experiences and understands the mantra.
 
If you wa=
nt to experience a mantra, try to focus your mind on the mantra and forget =
everything else. Even several notions you may have in your mind about the m=
antra and its deity may become blockages. Just forget everything and focus =
the mind on mantra alone.
 
If you spend your time contemplating your own a=
ctions and motivations behind them and try to root out ego whenever it rais=
es its head in your mind, it will be helpful. I do not mean pride by ego he=
re and mean self-identification with a body and a name. As long as such an =
identification is strong, it prevents one from being able to focus fully on=
 a mantra. A person with no or very subtle ego is far more likely to be abl=
e to achieve what I mentioned above, than a person with a dense ego.
 
When=
 contemplation and attitude correction go in parallel to meditation, the tw=
o activities enhance the effectiveness of the other and eventually one brea=
ks through and succeeds in lowering ego and starts to experience subtler an=
d higher things. When mind is so pre-occupied with body, name etc, it canno=
t experience subtler things that well.

l find the more samhara rupas, that is tamasik,

:-) Beauty is in the eye of the=
 beholder. To a devotee of Smashaana Kaali, She may be the most beautiful.

e is at once Brahmi, Vaishnavi and Raudri. The tejas from the other devatas=
 emerged as well to add to the created being of tejas, and this heap of acc=
umulated tejas was visualised by the devas in Maharshi Katyayan=C3=A2=E2=82=
=AC=E2=84=A2s ashram.  Since the tejas were from the bodies of the devas, t=

na. Here the Devi or Sri Durga=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s mula prakriti was t=
he 18 armed Mahalakshmi.   Whereas as Vishnumaya, where she killed Madhu an=
d Kaitabh,  her mula prakriti was Mahakali. So Sri Durga appeared on Krishn=
a Chaturdashi in Maharshi Katyayan=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s ashram. On Shuk=
la saptami, ashtami and navami Katyayan worshipped Sri Durga. Hence she is =
known as Katyayani. On Dashami she killed Mahishasura. Hence she is known a=
s Mahishasuramardini. She is also called Chandika Devi. This Chandika Devi =
though appeared initially in a samhara murti form, later manifested her ess=
ential rajas nature and appeared as Mahalakshmi. So if you have a Durga man=
tra, the devata maybe mentioned as Mahalakshmi. The Chamunda hrdaya bijas, =
aim hrim klim, is the Mahalakshmi hrdaya; hence you will see in many places=
 Chamunda is referred to as Mahalakshmi devata. 
> 
> Chandika Devi had pro=
mised the devas that she would reappear whenever they would need him. At th=
eir calling, she appeared next as the exquisitely beautiful goddess Ambika.=
 This time she emanated from Parvati=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s body and was =
formed from her body cells. She was the shakti inherent within Parvati, as =
Parvati is Adya Shakti, the unified trigunatmika form. Ambika Devi=C3=A2=E2=
=82=AC=E2=84=A2s essence is Mahasaraswati. She enticed the demons Shumbha a=
nd Nishumbha and after they fell in love with her, Kali emerged from her fo=
rehead, in a ferocious form. She was known as Chamunda. (The Kali puja that=
 is performed in Assam, Bengal and Orissa during the amavasya of Deepavali =
is essentially Chamunda Puja.  Elsewhere Lakshmi is worshipped on this day)=
.  Now Chamunda Devi=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s external form is fearful. Ski=
n on bones skeletal structure, red, sunken eyes, tiger skin clad, skull-gar=
landed, huge faced, darting tongue, making loud fear inspiring sounds, she =
ate the demons. She was created in the extreme tamas rupa, as the demons sh=
e was demolishing were very tamasik in nature. She beheaded Chanda and Mund=
a with the Hang bija and displayed the severed heads to Chandika Devi, who =
then told Kali that she will be henceforth famous as Chamunda. So Chandika/=
Ambika/Durga is the mula goddess and Kali/Chamunda emerged from her forehea=
d. In the Mahasarawati essence, there were many other Kali forms that emerg=
ed from Chandika Devi, like Shivaduti, who was so ferocious she made sounds=
 like the jackal. She was called Shivaduti as she used Shiva as a duta or a=
 messenger during her demon demolishing spiel. Chamunda also killed Raktabi=
ja but Shumbha and Nishumbha were killed by Chandika herself.
> 
> So you s=
ee, Chamunda specifically manifested as a tamas guna form like Kali. But he=
r hrdaya bija is that of Mahalakshmi like Durga. And she emerged from Chand=
ika, who is Adya Shakti, hence the root devata for the navarna mantra is Ma=
halakshmi, Mahakali, Mahasaraswati. The immediate form of Adya Shakti here =
is Chamunda. Like in the Vishnu Sahasranama, the devata is Narayana, the im=
mediate form worshipped is that of Vishnu. Because the mula is one but thei=
