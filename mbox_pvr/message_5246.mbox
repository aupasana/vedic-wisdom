Dear Utpal
In Is=
kcon they use word Prabhu for other devotees,example if I am Iskconite and =
if I meet you that I shall call you hello Prabhu now the story behind this(=
from their own words)that when they call you prabhu means you are under the=
ir Radar ! Means be watchful,careful from them!
I honestly did not want to =
start this discussion because of one reason and that is this our very group=
 is free from such topics and even Shri Satya Prakashji indirectly also poi=
nted to this plus point of this group but I could not stop myself even in p=
ast and in present and my blood start boiling when they use word Demi God f=
or my shivji,who are they to use such barometer for our devi and devatas?
F=
urther there are numerous examples of such devotees giving pravachanas when=
 you visit some temples,here I am omitting the names of those temples and o=
ne devotee who came from USA,a white man from Iskcon recently visited one t=
emple and he unfortunately was present in some pravachana given there by so=
me lady from Bangalore,he then wrote several posts in many groups with his =
views and objections on such theories.T
This hard path was one of the reaso=
n why they had to close their own discussion forum called India Divine rece=
ntly as there were some stupid comments on Shiva,Durga etc..thing is they j=
ust cannot neglect Shiva because Shiva has a special place in Hinduism and =
nothing will move against his will.
If anybody has soft corner for Iskcon,I=
 shall NOT say sorry for them for what I have=C2=A0written and said here,tr=
uth is a truth and let it be bitter for them.Glad to know that you controll=
ed your self,its indeed a very very difficult job after listening to their =
pravachana(thats what they say else it is a hopeless speech in real).I agre=
e totally with your views that after listing to those lines even Shri Krish=
na must have run away from that place.If you go to Dwarka there is a huge g=
ate made by them(Iskcon)and local people just take no notice of that gate w=
hat so ever till this date and this what they deserve.
regards and pranams,=
no sympothies to those who are really blind.

Namaskaar Narasimha Garu,

As it happenned, i visited a close =
family friend's house and attended "Damodara Pujan" conducted by one of the=
 Devotees from ISCON.
i attended the same Puja in the same friend's house l=
ast year and had got in to a very big arguments with another ISCON devotee =
who did it last time but this time My friend requested me not to object any=
thing that person says.

I tell you that I had a very hard time controlling=
 myself there. everything was nice and hunky dowry till the Damodar Aarati =
and Damodar Ashtakam, but after that the middle aged and soft natured devot=
ee started "Pravachan", There was bigotry all over. The pravachan was nothi=
ng but taking to the task, the Demi-Gods- The lesser Mortals amongst Gods s=
uch as Shiva, Sun, Durga and such and mounting on them insult after insults=
...
I am sure that after Aarati, even Krushna would have ran away from the =
place like Ranchhod Ray.

However, It also proved to me that My self contro=
l has little bit improved since last year though :).

with all due respect =
for your soft corner for them, I must say that I pray krishna that He never=
 entangle me to ISCON ever. I am much much much better off Loving band pray=
ing krishna while remaining very very very far from that organisations thou=
ght process.

I must say that there are good hearted, sincere and devoted p=
eople in that who though Love Krishna but also are all that utterly nonsens=
e stuff from The organisation.
I thank krishna for he has not got me in to =
the same. They, in their current form are no better than fenetics of Islam =
and other such religions.

I am sorry if i used very strong words but that =
is how it is. they are that bad when they start their "Pravachan"

Yours,

=
Utpal

oaching God is via Shri Narayana. If some one has their supreme god as Shiv=
a / Durga / Krishna so be it without sense of anger.  I respectifully =
disagree and move on  without being bitter. Honestly I have to say the=

<DIV>Dear Utpal</DIV>
<DIV>In Iskcon they use word Prabhu f=
or other devotees,example if I am Iskconite and if I meet you that I shall =
call you hello Prabhu now the story behind this(from their own words)that w=
hen they call you prabhu means you are under their Radar ! Means be watchfu=
l,careful from them!</DIV>
<DIV>I honestly did not want to start this discu=
ssion because of one reason and that is this our very group is free from su=
ch topics and even Shri Satya Prakashji indirectly also pointed to this plu=
s point of this group but I could not stop myself even in past and in prese=
nt and my blood start boiling when they use word Demi God for my shivji,who=
 are they to use such barometer for our devi and devatas?</DIV>
<DIV>Furthe=
r there are numerous examples of such devotees giving pravachanas when you =
visit some temples,here I am omitting the names of those temples and one de=
votee who came from USA,a white man from Iskcon recently visited one temple=
 and he unfortunately was present in some pravachana given there by some la=
dy from Bangalore,he then wrote several posts in many groups with his views=
 and objections on such theories.T</DIV>
<DIV>This hard path was one of the=
 reason why they had to close their own discussion forum called India Divin=
e recently as there were some stupid comments on Shiva,Durga etc..thing is =
they just cannot neglect Shiva because Shiva has a special place in Hinduis=
m and nothing will move against his will.</DIV>
<DIV>If anybody has soft co=
rner for Iskcon,I shall NOT say sorry for them for what I have written=
 and said here,truth is a truth and let it be bitter for them.Glad to know =
that you controlled your self,its indeed a very very difficult job after li=
stening to their pravachana(thats what they say else it is a hopeless speec=
h in real).I agree totally with your views that after listing to those line=
s even Shri Krishna must have run away from that place.If you go to Dwarka =
there is a huge gate made by them(Iskcon)and local people just take no noti=
ce of that gate what so ever till this date and this what they deserve.</DI=

 be many paths around the hill. One may be unable to see paths on the other=

t does no harm.<BR>> <BR>> As one reaches the top, it gets narrower a=
nd one may see the other paths that seemed quite distant earlier to be quit=
e nearby now. As one is very close to the top, one will see that all paths =
are leading there. When one is on the top, one sees all paths to converge t=
here. After god-realization, one sees various paths to be valid paths to go=
d. Of course, different paths come with different obstacles. One path may h=
ave some snow. One path may be too steep. One path may
 be slippery. One pa=
th may have falling rocks. One path may have fallen trees blocking it. And =
so on. But, one on the top knows that people can reach there using several =
paths, if they are committed to overcoming the obstacles and reaching the t=
op.<BR>> <BR>> Let people follow the paths chosen by them and wish th=

 They may fight with people and kill them too. They stay at the base foreve=

 problem.<BR>> <BR>> But, peopl=

on some path and will eventually reach god. For example, so many Krishna bh=

 several malas a day with a good level of devotion and they will eventually=

 Irrespec=
tive of where one was born and brought up, one will become a brahmana if on=
e follows this. Only brahmanas are qualified to play with the karmas of oth=
ers by giving life-altering advice or by conducting rituals. Again, to be c=
lear, I am not talking about brahmanas by birth, but about brahmanas by con=
duct.<BR>> > > > <BR>> > > > The above will become =
