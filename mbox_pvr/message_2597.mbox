Namaste,

(1) Apart from 16 upacharas instead of 5, there are other things. You invoke 
Varuna in a kalasha, do 16 upachara pooja, read Pavamaana (purifying) 
sooktam (also known as Punyaaha vaachanam), do pooja to dikpaalakas etc. 
Some people do Jayaadi homam as a part of uttaraangam (offerings to various 
Gandharvas and Apsaras representing various aspects of ourselves, with 
respective Veda mantras). For vasordhara, some read the entire Chamakam 
instead of just the 3rd anuvaakam. And so on. I may publish a long manual 
for Ganapathi homam sometime, if Mother is willing.

(2) You can do swaha in Chamakam after each anuvaakam. Some people offer 
just Namakam in pradhaana homam and read Chamakam for vasordhara. Namakam 
and Chamakam are a very powerful Vedic prayer.

*        *        *

Regarding your experiences, my thought is that your children are special 
with good spiritual potential. Any sadhana of an ugra devata, homam or 
meditation, can throw up some tests as one starts to make progress. As I 
explained earlier, this is like some mess spilling onto the floor as an 
agressive person tries to take out rotten fruits from a fruit basket and 
throws them into garbage can, so that some good fruits stuck under can be 
extracted. A gentle deity will be slow and careful and the spillover will be 
minimal. Also, the speed at which good fruits are extracted will also be 
slow. An ugra devata will be fast and agressive and there may be some 
spillover. But the good fruits are extracted fast that way. With a gentle 
deity such as Ganesha or Vishnu or Lakshmi, some spillover is possible, but 
it will be small. Most importantly, one should note that the rotten fruit 
that spilled over was put in that basket by oneself (i.e. one's own karma) 
and, for every little spillover, a lot more would've been successfully 
thrown into garbage can (i.e. bad karmas burnt up in sadhana so that they do 
not have to be experienced).

The fruits of one's sadhana will also be enjoyed by the people to whom one 
is closely attached and with whom one's karmas are strongly intertwined. 
However, any negative results due to spillover of karmas will usually be 
taken by the person oneself. However, if there are gentle and elevated souls 
around one, they *may* take it on themselves. This is like a gentle and nice 
person around you hurrying to clean up some rotten fruit spilled over on the 
floor near you.

First of all, these are all signs that Ganesha is not looking at just giving 
material benefits to you, as he does to most people, but considering you 
worthy of spiritual progress and testing you. Ganesha can give material and 
spiritual progress. Secondly, it shows that your children have some 
potential. Teach them some religious stuff from a young age.

Best regards,
Narasimha
