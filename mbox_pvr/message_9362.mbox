Namaste Sir,
=C2=A0
That is a variation satisfying the metre. But it is les=
s apt, for the following reasons:
=C2=A0
(1) The word "tu" indicates some i=
rony or contrast. If you say "He rules the bridge of dharma. Then again, he=
 destroys the path of adharma", there is no such contrast. Basically, I see=
 "tu" as a misfit there.
(2) Bhairava is not necessarily a deity destroying=
 adharma. In fact, he stands more for liberation and for destroying the dis=
tinction in one's mind between dharma and adharma. For example, he is depic=
ted as roaming around naked drinking wine.
=C2=A0
BTW, observe the imagery.=
 Line before says "dharma setu pAlakaM" - the ruler of the bridge of dharma=
. Dharma is merely seen as a bridge here. Bridge to what? Obviously bridge =
over the sea of samsara and into infinite freedom. Bhairava not only contro=
ls the bridge, but his main purpose is to take one into infinite freedom fr=
om that bridge. Thus, swadharma mArga nAshakaM fits nicely following that l=
ine.
=C2=A0
BTW, some people may be tempted to worship and Bhairava and emu=
late him by drinking wine or roaming naked in a smashan. That may not neces=
sarily liberate one. Please note that Bhairava is not free becausehe drinks=
 wine and roams naked. He is already free and does those things becausehe i=
s free. In any case, even Bhairava, the deity of destroying right-wrong dis=
tinctions in mind and ringing in liberation is described as "dharma setu pa=
laka"! Dharma is very important. Until you reach the shore of infinite free=
dom, you HAVE to stay afloat of the ocean ofsamsara, by getting atop the br=
idge of dharma! Otherwise you will sink in the ocean of samara, toppled by =
the waves of delusion. Though one needs to jump off the bridge in the end, =
"the end" is not anywhere near for most people on earth and they better rea=
lize it!

=C2=A0
This is why I (@homam108) tweeted a few weeks back that mo=
ksha is irrelevant to 99.9999% people. Instead of reading and thinking abou=
t moksha, think about dharma and do your dharma.

=C2=A0
Best regards,
Nara=
simha

>>=C2=A0
>>But performing swadharma =
is the start of sadhana. Eventually, one should be able to perform swadharm=
a without attachment to its fruits and later without even the sense of doer=
ship! Then comes a stage when one is not even attached to the idea that "th=
is is my dharma. I must do this". Whatever Nature has placed one in a posit=
ion to do, one does it detachedly, with neither sadness/disappointment nor =
with happiness/excitement, but with the spirit of "this is what Supreme Lor=
d is doing through me at this instant". One overcomes the notions that "I a=
m so and so. I need to do so and so", gives up one's own will and flows lik=
e a light leaf in the wind of samsara. Wherever one flows and whatever obje=
cts one touches, one sees it as the will of Supreme Lord and has no notions=
 of one's own will or one's own duties. That is the state of liberated enli=
ghtenment.
>>
>>=C2=A0
>>Bhairava is extolled in Bhairavashtakam as the one=
 who brings that state. Krishna also teaches to get to that state, but he d=
oes so in the last chapter of Bhagavad Gita. Before you get there, however,=
 you may have to follow the instructions in previous chapters!
>>=C2=A0
>>A=
 lot of modern Hindu philosophy taught by many modern gurus, especially of =
the Vedantic bent, is based on the final target rather than the path(s) one=
 needs to walk, to get to the target. It assumes that you are already close=
 to the target. It ends up misleading and creating wrong notions in unprepa=
red sadhakas like "all is delusion", "everything is the same", "what you do=
 does not matter". The greatness of Bhagavad Gita is that it talks about th=
e path(s) as well as the target and has something relevant to everyone.

font-style:normal;">But performing swadharma is the <span style=3D"font-sty=
le:italic;">start </span>of sadhana. <span style=3D"font-style:italic;">Eve=
ntually</span>, one should be able to perform swadharma without attachment =
to its fruits and later without even the sense of doership! Then comes a st=
age when one is not even attached to the idea that "this is my dharma. I mu=
st do this". Whatever Nature has placed one in a position to do, one does i=
t detachedly, with neither sadness/disappointment nor with happiness/excite=
ment, but with the spirit of "this is what Supreme Lord is doing through me=
 at this instant". One overcomes the notions that "I am so and so. I need t=
o do so and so", gives up one's own will and flows like a light leaf in the=
 wind of samsara. Wherever one flows and whatever objects one touches, one =
sees it as the will of Supreme Lord and has no notions of one's own will or=
 one's own duties. <span

 Hindu philosophy taught by many modern gurus, =
especially of the Vedantic bent, is based on the final target rather than t=
he path(s) one needs to walk, to get to the target. It assumes that you are=
 already close to the target. It ends up misleading and creating wrong noti=
ons in unprepared sadhakas like "all is delusion", "everything is the same"=
, "what you do does not matter". The greatness of Bhagavad Gita is that it =
talks about the path(s) as well as the target and has something relevant to=
 everyone.<br></div><div style=3D"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;fo=
