Namaste Sir,
=A0
<<About 6 years have passed since u started doing Chandi h=
omam. Can you pls share ur experiences like what changes have come in you a=
nd 
all others who r doing chandi homam, pls also share ur experinces.>>
=
=A0
First let me take it internally. I was proud of my achievements, schola=
rship and clarity of thinking, several years back. I still am. But, when so=
meone bluntly tells me that (very few dare/care to!), it does not upset me =
but makes me think now.
=A0
I used to experience attacks of anger, jealosy,=
 greed, delusion and lust quite
often. I still do. But I am able to resist =
better now and can 
recover and move on quickly instead of suffering for a =
long time.
=A0
I used to readily write about some mystical experiences (som=
etimes in third person, i.e. without specifically mentioning that it was *m=
y* experience), but the motivation was not only to inspire others to do sad=
hana but partly to "impress" others about my "achievements". Now, I share s=
omething only if I genuinely feel that the experience or the disclaimer I m=
ention at the end may inspire or caution or otherwise benefit someone. Now =
I hardly do it on public forums anyway and do it with only a handful of peo=
ple when an occasion comes.
=A0
Now, let me take it externally. When my com=
pany closed a business unit many months back, I had to move from a group wh=
ere I had some clout to a group where I was new. Though things are the same=
 financially, there is a big change in the influence. But I am more relaxed=
 than before.
=A0
I was known as a good scholar and teacher of Jyotish and =
"chairman" of a Jyotish organization based on a parampara. I am alone now, =
and not even sure of basic calculations (e.g. ayanamsa, computation of cert=
ain divisional charts etc) even after experimenting with more possibilities=
 than ever. Though I have not fully convinced myself what is correct, I hav=
e convinced myself that whatever is out there is incorrect/incomplete (howe=
ver, I keep teaching and giving readings to some people who trust me, based=
 on "my best current understanding"). I am more focused than ever in my Jyo=
tish research, but do not feel any undue pressure to solve the puzzles like=
 before.
=A0
Probably this is=A0not=A0what you wanted to hear.. ;-) In any =
case, different people may get different results based on their karmas, das=
as, gochara etc.
=A0
Now, on a serious note, those who are frustrated that =
their sadhana is not producing results may do well to realize that Rome is =
not built in a day. Vasanas that have been reinforced in our consciousness =
for many lives cannot be overcome in a few years. Just keep doing sadhana..=

=A0
Aslo,
 what seems like a loss from one angle may seem from another ang=
le like liberation from some unneeded baggage. What seems like a gain from =

one angle may seem from another angle like an unneeded baggage that bogs o=
ne down.
=A0
As I keep insisting, please don't idolize me or anyone associa=
ted with homam movement. The whole idea behind homam is that Agni is the or=
iginal preceptor of rishis and can ably guide anyone who surrenders to Him.=
 Ignore personalities, surrender to Agni and walk your walk.

=A0
Best rega=
rds,
Narasimha
