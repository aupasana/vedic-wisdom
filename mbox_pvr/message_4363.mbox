Namaste,
 
I am assuming that you are living outside India, in US or Europe.
 
If an exhaust fan is installed above the homa kundam, it can suck the smoke if it is strong enough and close enough the to the fire. I have seen exhausts that are 6 ft above the homa kundam sucking smoke quite well. However, the disadvantages of an exhaust are:
 
(1) It is noisy. You won't have silence.
(2) It keeps sucking air. You need to put a fan in another place in the room to keep supplying fresh air as air is sucked by the exhaust.
 
Doing on the balcony or a patio is also good. But it will work only in spring and summer and perhaps autumn. In winter (which is quite long at northern longitudes), it will be too cold. Moreover, if you use firewood logs and do homam with big fire, then smoke can hit the external walls of the house due to wind and the walls can blacken over the time.
 
If there is a fireplace with a chimney that is taller than the entire house, smoke will go up into the air. I know some people who have traditional one-side-open fireplaces and do homam by placing their homa kundam inside it. At my house, I have a custom built four side open fireplace in the middle of the pooja room. It is basically a 2 ft x 2 ft pit with a 1.5 ft wall on all 4 sides and small pillars on the 4 corners of that wall and a chimney resting on the pillars and going 2 ft above the top of the house. People sitting on all 4 sides can see the fire or make offerings. I place a 1ft x 1ft homa kundam inside that pit amid bricks and do my daily homam there. But, when I want, I also have the option of doing a homam in the full 2ft x 2ft pit directly. Of course, a regular one-side-open fireplace will serve the purpose as well.
 
I think the main factor is where you live and how cold it will get in the winter.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
