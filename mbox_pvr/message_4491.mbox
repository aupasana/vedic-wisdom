Dear Narasimhaji,
=C2=A0
Thanks for your reply.
=C2=A0
1. "There are many s=
tandard homam procedures in the world today, some more elaborate than what =
we teach and some more brief. " - 
=C2=A0
Please clarify whether the homa p=
rocedure taught by you belongs to the vedic system. If so, which authoritat=
ive text have you relied upon? Or is it one designed by yourself keeping th=
e convenience factor in mind ?
=C2=A0
There are many procedures even within=
 the vedic system for performing homam. Each established procedure given by=
 acharyas=C2=A0 is complete=C2=A0in itself and do not violate the fundament=
al principles of vedic rituals.
=C2=A0
It will be interesting here to point=
 out that when some sections of samavedis when they perform sraadham=C2=A0d=
o the=C2=A0hormam on the palm of the bhokta brahmin. It is called panihomam=
. Even the fire is not present there. It is based on a dictum called " brah=
manasya dakshine haste hotavyam" - the homa is to be performed on the right=
 hand of the brahmin. It is believed that agni is ever present in the right=
 hand of the srotriya (one learned in the veda) brahmin. There is no defect=
 here. It is as per sastra. Now if you modify this and say that homa can be=
 perfromed on the right glove worn by a brahmin, then the problem arises.
=
=C2=A0
As you have said, any system of worship is acceptable. There are so =
many religions and cults all around the world. Nobody objects. If you call =
something vedic, please make sure that it conforms to the vedic tenets.
=C2=
=A0
Homam is a ritualistic form of worship and if you bring in advaita vada=
 in it it doesn't work.
=C2=A0
It is not a question of whether it is more e=
laborate or less elaborate or which is inferior or which is superior. It is=
 a question of whether it is correct and based on what vedic authority. If =
you are promoting this homa procedure as one of your own design, there is n=
o objection. On the contrary, if you need the sanction of vedic authority f=
or it, please=C2=A0answer within the ambit of vedic knowledge=C2=A0if doubt=
s are raised.
=C2=A0
The apprehension is that in the year 2000 you said,
=
=C2=A0
"I cannot possibly finish this preface without expressing my deep gr=
atitude for my 
guru Pt. Sanjay Rath, who has been a constant source of enl=
ightenment, 
encouragement and inspiration. I am eternally grateful to him"=

=C2=A0
and now you say
=C2=A0
"In my well-considered view, Sanjay ji got s=
ome specific secrets and some generic guidelines (which may be imperfect, l=
ike with all other paramparas) from his elders. He then read some books and=
 formed his understanding. As he started teaching it, he received a lot of =
adulation for the "parampara secrets". I am afraid he got addicted to the a=
dulation and started to manufacture "parampara secrets" after the initial r=
un. Slowly he became commercial and he started selling manufactured "paramp=
ara knowledge".
=C2=A0
Yes, his teachings contain fascinating philosophizat=
ion, which is really superficial and does not stand any real scrutiny. His =
theories are like beautiful structures built with a pack of cards. Sanjay j=
i always maintains an air of "I know more, but will teach later". It is con=
venient to give the impression that there is more. If anything does not mak=
e sense, it could be because you have to learn more!
=C2=A0
As he started e=
xploiting and commercializing half-baked and ill-conceived knowledge in the=
 name of a parampara, I took an exception to the commercialization and dish=
onesty. After expressing my reservations privately and having no effect, I =
started to go public, first subtly and later bluntly. After several clashes=
, I was kicked out of SJC.
=C2=A0
With basic concepts like houses, arudha p=
adas, chara karakas, argalas etc, the generic guidelines he received are im=
perfect. He deviates from Parasara in several matters and his teachings do =
not work consistently.
=C2=A0
Bottomline: Sanjay ji's base is made of some =
specific secrets (that are imperfect) and some generic guidelines (that are=
 imperfect too). Starting from that base and reading books, he hastily crea=
ted a body of knowledge which he sells now. If there is anything in his tea=
chings that can be used relatively reliably, it is TP."
=C2=A0
In 2000 you =
said
=C2=A0

"Narayana dasa is a very important rasi dasa. It is a phalita =
dasa. It shows general
results. Narayana dasa is computed differently for d=
ifferent divisional charts and we
can use Narayana dasa of a divisional cha=
rt to predict matters related to that
divisional chart.
=C2=A0
Narayana das=
a is based on the progression of lagna in one=E2=80=99s life. As one dasa e=
nds
and another starts, one rasi stops being the progressed lagna and anoth=
er rasi
becomes one=E2=80=99s progressed lagna. Using the progressed lagna =
as the reference, we
find out the events that happen in that dasa. Thus we =
get twelve charts for each
person, with each chart applicable in one dasa.
=
=C2=A0
This is a very versatile dasa system and readers sould pay attention=
 to the details of
calculation."
=C2=A0
now you say
=C2=A0
"Narayana dasa m=

is quite obvious that he is at an entry level.
=C2=A0

3. "Kn=

=C2=A0
Rituals do evolve around desa and kaala but if it starts evolvin=

Namaste,

Thanks for your views. There are many standard homam procedu=
res in the world today, some more elaborate than what we teach and some mor=
e brief. I do not care exactly what procedure one uses and I will be happy =
if more and more people do homam *regularly*, irrespective of the exact pro=
cedure used! What I teach is ONE procedure for those who do not know any. I=
f you are initiated into a different procedure that you can do daily, pleas=
e go ahead and do it daily the way you know it. That will make us very happ=
y. However, if the method you know cannot be done daily, please consider wh=
at I taught, which is simple enough to do daily.

* * *

Suppose there are =
rules and protocols on how one should serve lunch to one's parents, e.g. ho=
w to place the plates, spoons, forks, soup bowls, drink cups, dessert bowls=
 etc and how and in what order to serve various items in those containers. =
Suppose the protocol is so complex that one cannot do it everyday and calls=
 one's parents for a lunch once every few months.

Is that better or is it =
better to relax the rules and protocols to make it less formal and serve lu=
nch to parents everyday?

* * *

> 21. I suggest that we preserve each bran=
ch of knowledge in its own purity.
> Hybrids may not always yield good resu=
lts. Let almighty help to preserve
> knowledge uncorrupted.

The only knowl=
edge that should (and can) be preserved without corruption is knowledge tha=
t is *absolute*. Veda, or the knowledge of imperishable Self, alone is abso=
lute knowledge.

Knowledge of *external rituals* is relative and can never =
be absolute. It evolves based on desa-kaala-paatra. There is nothing impure=
 or corrupt about it.

At the end of the day, the key is whether one is act=
ually doing some sadhana on a regular basis or not, whether it is causing i=
nternal transformation in one or not, and whether it helps in one's spiritu=
al progress or not.

* * *

Let me cut & paste a section from a writeup I w=
rote for an upcoming occasion. It contains an analogy given earlier and add=
resses some relevant issues.

-----------------------------
Do Vedas Descri=
be External Rituals

Some people believe that Veda describes the specifics =
about various external yagyas. Veda is supposed to be absolute, timeless an=
d uncreated knowledge that is not bound by desa-kaala-paatra. How can descr=
iptions of specific external rituals be unbound by desa-kaala-paatra?

Thou=
gh Sayanacharya=E2=80=99s celebrated commentary on RigVeda is ritualistic i=
n nature, Aurobindo Ghose had a different take in his =E2=80=9CSecret of th=
e Veda=E2=80=9D. His view is that Veda talks about absolute truths about th=
e inner self and not relative truths about external matters. Agni or Fire s=
ymbolizes the divine Will. That is why it is the immortal in mortals. Its r=
hythm will devour everything that is perishable and purify all. While fire =
in a fire ritual symbolizes the divine Will, various offerings in it symbol=
ize various aspects of one=E2=80=99s conditioning and the smoke symbolizes =
one=E2=80=99s passions and desires.

Metaphor: Vedic Homam vs Aagamic Homam=


Notions that so and so yagya ritual is sanctioned by Veda and so and so a=
agamic/tantric yagya ritual is not sanctioned by Veda can be put in perspec=
tive using a metaphor.

Once there were many people who lived near the sea =
[Aatman]. They regularly sat by the sea and enjoyed the sight and sound of =
the sea [absorbed in Aatman most of the time]. They described the sea in so=
me nice cryptic poems [Veda].

As people started living a little away from =
the sea [less spiritually evolved], someone had to put together some instru=
ctions on how to reach the sea. He said, "keep walking towards east" and th=
e instructions grew with time. People faithfully followed the instructions =
[rituals].

People started moving further and further inland and started li=
ving in a landlocked desert far away from the sea. This generation had neve=
r seen a pool of water like a lake, let alone a sea. They faithfully perfor=
med the ritual of walking towards east, but did not find sea. They debated =
endlessly whether one had to walk one mile or two miles or three miles and =
formed different schools of thought. Some walked their chosen distance, fou=
nd a tree or a building or some interesting object and even became satisfie=
d that that was sea!

Then came some great person, whose instincts led him =
to take a horse instead of walking and ride it for a long distance [use of =
other tools]. He did find the sea after a few months. He put together newer=
 instructions to reach the sea, which included riding a horse [new =C3=A4ga=
ma and tantra].

People performing the old rituals objected to this and sai=
d "but then this horse thing is not granted by the book of sea. This is a n=
ew path and different from the "pure" sea ritual" [pure Vedic ritual]. By n=
ow, people did not even understand what the cryptic poems of the original "=
book of sea" mean, but they simply believed that those poems taught the old=
 "pure" sea rituals that they were used to. They were blissfully unaware th=
at the original instructions were meant for someone already close to sea an=
d the newer instructions came from someone who actually saw the sea and kne=
w where they currently lived and how to get to the sea from there!

Slowly =
many new sets of instructions involving horses, chariots etc were taught an=
d many new paths to the sea were outlined instead of just instructing peopl=
e to walk towards east [evolution of mantra/tantra/yantras].

One particula=
r path through jungles was dangerous [aghora and other dark tantric paths i=
nvolving practice of sex, meat, wine etc]. Though the distance to sea was m=
uch shorter through that jungle, it was just too dangerous and only the bra=
vest and strongest could make it. There were cruel dacoits and wild animals=
 [chance of a fall in a risky ritual] and many weak people travelling to se=
a via that path were killed. A wise man who knew the entire territory well =
came forward, condemned that path and discouraged people from trying that p=
ath. Since then, even people who were strong enough to successfully make it=
 in that path desisted from it.

As time progressed, people started fightin=
g too much about whose path was superior. They were foolish, not smart enou=
gh to adopt the original instructions, of either the so-called "pure" sea p=
ath or the so-called "new" path or other variations, for the changed geogra=
phy and changed times. Many followed the instructions blindly, hit roadbloc=
ks and did not reach sea. Many did not even know that "reaching the sea" wa=
s the actual goal of all their joirneys. They only thought they were suppos=
ed to follow the instructions faithfully and there was no need to adopt to =
the changed geographical territory and time. They even condemned those who =
actually went to sea, came back and gave updated directions for their place=
 and time, for violating tradition.

In case the analogy is not clear, here=
 is a brief summary of its points. Veda is about realizing self. Vedic deit=
ies such as Agni, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Aswins, Brihaspati etc are slightly=
 different aspects of Aatman. Veda describes various aspects of the state o=
f self-realization. That is why it is considered the highest knowledge. Oth=
er allied subjects throw some light on possible ways to reach that state. W=
hile definitive and absolute statements can be made on the actual state of =
self-realization itself, no definitive statements can be made on how to rea=
ch it. Only relative statements can be made based on desa-kaala-paatra. The=
 path depends on one's current position!

Great men in many spiritual paths=
, within Hinduism as well as outside of it, came, experienced that state, u=
nderstood the current state of people around them and gave specific instruc=
tions on how to reach that state from the current state. Some followed the =
instructions and experienced the state. Some instead kept arguing about the=
 contradictions between paths.

Stop Arguing and Do Sadhana

As the metapho=
r above illustrates, arguments about various paths are irrelevant and distr=
acting. What is important is to pick a path and follow it. Whether one does=
 a Vedic homam or an Aagamic homam is a secondary issue. The primary issues=
 are whether one does homam or not, how focused one is, how one=E2=80=99s f=
ocus is improving and how one is being transformed internally.

Just as a t=
wenty course meal eaten once every six months does not give much energy to =
one, a =E2=80=9Cbig=E2=80=9D homam or another ritual done once every six mo=
nths or a year does not boost one=E2=80=99s spiritual or material pursuits.=
 Just as a small bowl of rice and lentil soup eaten everyday gives more ene=
rgy to one, a small 20-30 minute homam done everyday gives a boost to one=
=E2=80=99s spiritual evolution.

Wise Tradeoffs

Suppose the president of t=
he country is visiting one for lunch with 100 associates. One can invite al=
l the 100 associates of the President by name and seat them in the room ind=
ividually, following various protocols. Then one can exchange long pleasant=
ries with the President and then offer lunch.

Suppose one is in a hurry an=
d has very little time. If one still invites all the 100 associates by name=
 and seats them in the room individually following the protocol and does no=
t have enough time to let the President eat lunch in the end, is it a wise =
tradeoff? Or is it wiser to invite all the 100 associates together and seat=
 them together by violating the protocol and use that time to let the Presi=
dent eat in peace?

Similarly, is it wise if one exchanges long pleasantrie=
s and gives very little time to eat? Or should one cut short on the pleasan=
tries and give more time to eat?

In a fire ritual, making offerings to the=
 main deity is the primary part. Various upacharas done to the deity before=
 the offerings commence is secondary. Various preliminary and final steps a=
nd offerings to associate deities are tertiary. If one has a few hours for =
the fire ritual, one can do everything given in scriptures leisurely. If on=
e has only 20-30 minutes, one needs to make wise tradeoffs and maximize the=
 benefit. It is far better than doing nothing.

<sections deleted>

Proof o=
f the Pudding

At this time, more than hundred people are doing a homam to =
some deity or the other, everyday. Spending time worshipping god in fire fo=
r 20-30 min (or more) everyday, with an attitude of surrender and with some=
 basic intellectual understanding of the absolute truths expounded by Veda =
and Upanishads, can do a world of good to one=E2=80=99s spiritual evolution=
. The proof of the pudding is in eating it. One can try to perform a short =
homam everyday for a few months and see for oneself if there is a differenc=
e in one=E2=80=99s attitude, focus and clarity of thinking.

<DIV> </DIV=

<DIV>Thanks for your reply.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>1. "There are ma=
ny standard homam procedures in the world today, some more elaborate than w=
hat we teach and some more brief. " - </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Please =
clarify whether the homa procedure taught by you belongs to the vedic syste=
m. If so, which authoritative text have you relied upon? Or is it one desig=
ned by yourself keeping the convenience factor in mind ?</DIV>
<DIV> <=
/DIV>
<DIV>There are many procedures even within the vedic system for perfo=
rming homam. Each established procedure given by acharyas  is complete=
 in itself and do not violate the fundamental principles of vedic ritu=
als.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>It will be interesting here to point out =
that when some sections of samavedis when they perform sraadham do the=
 hormam on the palm of the bhokta brahmin. It is called panihomam. Eve=
n the fire is not present there. It is based on a dictum called " brahmanas=
ya dakshine haste hotavyam" - the homa is to be performed on the right hand=
 of the brahmin. It is believed that agni is ever present in the right hand=
 of the srotriya (one learned in the veda) brahmin. There is no defect here=
. It is as per sastra. Now if you modify this and say that homa can be perf=
romed on the right glove worn by a brahmin, then the problem arises.</DIV>
=
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>As you have said, any system of worship is acceptabl=
e. There are so many religions and cults all around the world. Nobody objec=
ts. If you call something vedic, please make sure that it conforms to the v=
edic tenets.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Homam is a ritualistic form of wo=
rship and if you bring in advaita vada in it it doesn't work.</DIV>
<DIV>&n=
bsp;</DIV>
<DIV>It is not a question of whether it is more elaborate or les=
s elaborate or which is inferior or which is superior. It is a question of =
whether it is correct and based on what vedic authority. If you are promoti=
ng this homa procedure as one of your own design, there is no objection. On=
 the contrary, if you need the sanction of vedic authority for it, please&n=
bsp;answer within the ambit of vedic knowledge if doubts are raised.</=

<DIV>"In my well-considered view, Sanjay ji got some specific secrets a=

o manufacture "parampara secrets" after the initial run. Slowly he became c=
ommercial and he started selling manufactured "parampara knowledge".</DIV>
=
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Yes, his teachings contain fascinating philosophizat=
ion, which is really superficial and does not stand any real scrutiny. His =
theories are like beautiful structures built with a pack of cards. Sanjay j=
i always maintains an air of "I know more, but will teach later". It is con=
venient to give the impression that there is more. If anything does not mak=

<DIV> </DIV=

<DIV>As he started exploiting and commercializing half-baked and ill-conc=

 After several clashes, I was kicked out of SJC.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<D=

<D=

<DIV>Bottomline: Sanjay ji's base is made of some specific =
secrets (that are imperfect) and some generic guidelines (that are imperfec=

section from a writeup I wrote for an upcoming occasion. It contains an ana=
logy given earlier and addresses some relevant issues.<BR><BR>-------------=
----------------<BR>Do Vedas Describe External Rituals<BR><BR>Some people b=
elieve that Veda describes the specifics about various external yagyas. Ved=
a is supposed to be absolute, timeless and uncreated knowledge that is not =
bound by desa-kaala-paatra. How can descriptions of specific external ritua=
ls be unbound by desa-kaala-paatra?<BR><BR>Though Sayanacharya=E2=80=99s ce=
lebrated commentary on RigVeda is ritualistic in nature, Aurobindo Ghose ha=
d a different take in his =E2=80=9CSecret of the Veda=E2=80=9D. His view is=
 that Veda talks about absolute truths about the inner self and not relativ=
e truths about external matters. Agni or Fire symbolizes the divine Will. T=
hat is why it is the immortal in mortals. Its rhythm will devour everything=
 that is
 perishable and purify all. While fire in a fire ritual symbolizes=
 the divine Will, various offerings in it symbolize various aspects of one=
=E2=80=99s conditioning and the smoke symbolizes one=E2=80=99s passions and=
 desires.<BR><BR>Metaphor: Vedic Homam vs Aagamic Homam<BR><BR>Notions that=
 so and so yagya ritual is sanctioned by Veda and so and so aagamic/tantric=
 yagya ritual is not sanctioned by Veda can be put in perspective using a m=
etaphor.<BR><BR>Once there were many people who lived near the sea [Aatman]=
. They regularly sat by the sea and enjoyed the sight and sound of the sea =
[absorbed in Aatman most of the time]. They described the sea in some nice =
cryptic poems [Veda].<BR><BR>As people started living a little away from th=
e sea [less spiritually evolved], someone had to put together some instruct=
ions on how to reach the sea. He said, "keep walking towards east" and the =
instructions grew with time. People faithfully followed the instructions
 [=
rituals].<BR><BR>People started moving further and further inland and start=
ed living in a landlocked desert far away from the sea. This generation had=
 never seen a pool of water like a lake, let alone a sea. They faithfully p=
erformed the ritual of walking towards east, but did not find sea. They deb=
ated endlessly whether one had to walk one mile or two miles or three miles=
 and formed different schools of thought. Some walked their chosen distance=
, found a tree or a building or some interesting object and even became sat=
isfied that that was sea!<BR><BR>Then came some great person, whose instinc=
ts led him to take a horse instead of walking and ride it for a long distan=
ce [use of other tools]. He did find the sea after a few months. He put tog=
ether newer instructions to reach the sea, which included riding a horse [n=
ew =C3=A4gama and tantra].<BR><BR>People performing the old rituals objecte=
d to this and said "but then this horse thing is not granted by the
 book o=
f sea. This is a new path and different from the "pure" sea ritual" [pure V=
edic ritual]. By now, people did not even understand what the cryptic poems=
 of the original "book of sea" mean, but they simply believed that those po=
ems taught the old "pure" sea rituals that they were used to. They were bli=
ssfully unaware that the original instructions were meant for someone alrea=
dy close to sea and the newer instructions came from someone who actually s=
aw the sea and knew where they currently lived and how to get to the sea fr=
om there!<BR><BR>Slowly many new sets of instructions involving horses, cha=
riots etc were taught and many new paths to the sea were outlined instead o=
f just instructing people to walk towards east [evolution of mantra/tantra/=
yantras].<BR><BR>One particular path through jungles was dangerous [aghora =
and other dark tantric paths involving practice of sex, meat, wine etc]. Th=
ough the distance to sea was much shorter through that
 jungle, it was just=
 too dangerous and only the bravest and strongest could make it. There were=
 cruel dacoits and wild animals [chance of a fall in a risky ritual] and ma=
ny weak people travelling to sea via that path were killed. A wise man who =
knew the entire territory well came forward, condemned that path and discou=
raged people from trying that path. Since then, even people who were strong=
 enough to successfully make it in that path desisted from it.<BR><BR>As ti=
me progressed, people started fighting too much about whose path was superi=
or. They were foolish, not smart enough to adopt the original instructions,=
 of either the so-called "pure" sea path or the so-called "new" path or oth=
er variations, for the changed geography and changed times. Many followed t=
he instructions blindly, hit roadblocks and did not reach sea. Many did not=
 even know that "reaching the sea" was the actual goal of all their joirney=
s. They only thought they were supposed to
 follow the instructions faithfu=
lly and there was no need to adopt to the changed geographical territory an=
d time. They even condemned those who actually went to sea, came back and g=
ave updated directions for their place and time, for violating tradition.<B=
R><BR>In case the analogy is not clear, here is a brief summary of its poin=
ts. Veda is about realizing self. Vedic deities such as Agni, Indra, Mitra,=
 Varuna, Aswins, Brihaspati etc are slightly different aspects of Aatman. V=
eda describes various aspects of the state of self-realization. That is why=
 it is considered the highest knowledge. Other allied subjects throw some l=
ight on possible ways to reach that state. While definitive and absolute st=
atements can be made on the actual state of self-realization itself, no def=
initive statements can be made on how to reach it. Only relative statements=
 can be made based on desa-kaala-paatra. The path depends on one's current =
position!<BR><BR>Great men in many
 spiritual paths, within Hinduism as wel=
l as outside of it, came, experienced that state, understood the current st=
ate of people around them and gave specific instructions on how to reach th=
at state from the current state. Some followed the instructions and experie=
nced the state. Some instead kept arguing about the contradictions between =
paths.<BR><BR>Stop Arguing and Do Sadhana<BR><BR>As the metaphor above illu=
strates, arguments about various paths are irrelevant and distracting. What=
 is important is to pick a path and follow it. Whether one does a Vedic hom=
am or an Aagamic homam is a secondary issue. The primary issues are whether=
 one does homam or not, how focused one is, how one=E2=80=99s focus is impr=
oving and how one is being transformed internally.<BR><BR>Just as a twenty =
course meal eaten once every six months does not give much energy to one, a=
 =E2=80=9Cbig=E2=80=9D homam or another ritual done once every six months o=
r a year does not boost one=E2=80=99s spiritual or
 material pursuits. Just=
 as a small bowl of rice and lentil soup eaten everyday gives more energy t=
o one, a small 20-30 minute homam done everyday gives a boost to one=E2=80=
=99s spiritual evolution.<BR><BR>Wise Tradeoffs<BR><BR>Suppose the presiden=
t of the country is visiting one for lunch with 100 associates. One can inv=
ite all the 100 associates of the President by name and seat them in the ro=
om individually, following various protocols. Then one can exchange long pl=
easantries with the President and then offer lunch.<BR><BR>Suppose one is i=
n a hurry and has very little time. If one still invites all the 100 associ=
ates by name and seats them in the room individually following the protocol=
 and does not have enough time to let the President eat lunch in the end, i=
s it a wise tradeoff? Or is it wiser to invite all the 100 associates toget=
her and seat them together by violating the protocol and use that time to l=
et the President eat in peace?<BR><BR>Similarly, is
 it wise if one exchang=
es long pleasantries and gives very little time to eat? Or should one cut s=
hort on the pleasantries and give more time to eat?<BR><BR>In a fire ritual=
, making offerings to the main deity is the primary part. Various upacharas=
 done to the deity before the offerings commence is secondary. Various prel=
iminary and final steps and offerings to associate deities are tertiary. If=
 one has a few hours for the fire ritual, one can do everything given in sc=
riptures leisurely. If one has only 20-30 minutes, one needs to make wise t=
radeoffs and maximize the benefit. It is far better than doing nothing.<BR>=
<BR><sections deleted><BR><BR>Proof of the Pudding<BR><BR>At this tim=
e, more than hundred people are doing a homam to some deity or the other, e=
veryday. Spending time worshipping god in fire for 20-30 min (or more) ever=
yday, with an attitude of surrender and with some basic intellectual unders=
tanding of the absolute truths expounded by
 Veda and Upanishads, can do a =
world of good to one=E2=80=99s spiritual evolution. The proof of the puddin=
g is in eating it. One can try to perform a short homam everyday for a few =
months and see for oneself if there is a difference in one=E2=80=99s attitu=
de, focus and clarity of thinking.<BR>-----------------------------<BR><BR>=

I had posted a message in jHora in response to a forward from Jyotishwritin=

er rules laid out by srouta and gruhya sutras which
 describe the preocedur=

apoornamasa (which is the prakruti of all yajnas).<BR>> <BR>> 2. All =
steps in darsapoornamasa should be there in the homam procedure (some exist=
 in tooshnee or amantraka form, but it has to be there). We are nobody to j=
udge which are essential and which are not essential. They are laid down by=
 vedas and later elaborated by acharyas.<BR>> <BR>> 3. There are vari=
ations in procedures in the different sutras such as apastamba sutra, bohay=
ana sutra, asvalayana sutra etc., but no omissions.<BR>> <BR>> 4. The=
 ordinary materials such as fire wood, grains, ghee etc. become worthy of d=
ivine usage only when they are divinised using the right procedure. Then on=
ly it becomes a divine procedure. Otherwise it is only a "fire ritual" as n=
amed. I suggest reading of the volumnous work "Agni" by Frits Staal to get =
a insight into the importance of these
 steps.<BR>> <BR>> 5. The proc=
edure in the manual is not as laid out by any of the sutras. There are larg=
e deviations and omissions. It looks like a mix of vedic and tantrik proced=
ures. <BR>> <BR>> 6. In paristarana or laying the darbha aorund the k=
unda there is a particular manner in which the tips of succeeding darbhas a=
re tucked under the bottom of the prceeding ones.<BR>> <BR>> 7. The d=
irection for sprinkling water (mantra parishkekam) with the mantra "deva sa=
vita prasuva" ie:- #4 is shown to be from SE corner to NE corner. This can =
not be because apasavya is for pitru karyas. It is in a circle starting fro=
m NE corner and ending at NE corner (Eshaadi eeshaantam).<BR>> <BR>> =
8 Patraasadanam or keeping the vessels and ladles used in the vessel above =
darbha is missing.<BR>> <BR>> 9.Prokshanee samskaram and prokshanam f=

samskaram, varuna avahanam on praneeta, varuna poojanam and aacchadanam (co=

re given in drops. There is fixed quantity of ghee to be given in each ahut=
i. Otherwise it will lead to dravyalopa.<BR>> <BR>> and many more ...=

 <BR>> 18. Strictly speaking, in the vedic procedure t=

ts as carrier for the other gods (havya vahaka). Depending on the name of d=
eity pronounced in satva tyaga, agni carries the offering to the particular=
 deity. If at all deity is invoked it is gaunam (secondary or not necessary=
)<BR>> <BR>> 18. In the tantrik procedure, the deity is invoked into =
the kunda and the agni acts either as the jadharagni of the deity or the ag=
ni itself is converted into the deity (agnyatmaka) by offering the specifie=
d agni devata aikya ahutis.<BR>> <BR>> 19. Very good alternate homa p=
rocedures are available in the mantra sastra (refer Mantra maharnava for ex=
ample) ideal for sadhakas. They don't involve veda mantras so that you don'=
t have to struggle to get the right pronunciation and svaras. These procedu=
res are designed for mantra sadhakas who perform homam on their own. They c=
an be
 easily adapted to perfrom homam for any devata.<BR>> <BR>> 20.=
 Homam should not be seen as a 20 minute Jane Fonda work out that can be le=
arned from a video. It involves learning from an able guru and practice wit=
h devotion, precision and perfection.<BR>> <BR>> 21. I suggest that w=
e preserve each branch of knowledge in its own purity. Hybrids may not alwa=
ys yield good results. Let almighty help to preserve knowledge uncorrupted.=
