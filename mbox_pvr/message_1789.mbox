Dear Rajarshi,
 
It was she who also recounted the episode of Ramakrishna s=
aying he would be back in 100 years.
 
I see no clash between the two state=
ments. Both could be authentic.
 
If Lord Vishnu was born on earth in an em=
bodied form as Lord Rama, it does NOT mean Lord Narasimha (a previous incar=
nation) no longer works in the astral plane to bless and affect devotees.
 =

The play of divine souls is different from that of normal souls. Though al=
l souls are identical and nondifferent from Brahman at the non-dual level, =
there are differences between them at the level of duality. Their capabilit=
ies and plays in the manifested universe are different.
 
A deity or rishi =
may continue to exist in a high plane of consciousness in astral form and y=
et an amsha (part) of him/her may take an embodied form on earth.
 
Best re=
gards,
Narasimha
