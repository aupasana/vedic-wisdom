Namaste,
 
Nice excerpt.
 
External things like pilgrimages and rituals are=
 for ultimately stimulating internal transformation. If they are not accomp=
anied by internal transformation, they are useless.
 
People are always eag=
er to get something easily. They think that they can get a lot of good by v=
isiting a specific place or doing a particular ritual or saying a particula=
r mantra or wearing vibhuti or sandalwood powder from a particular temple o=
r a particular ritual etc. Unfortunately, the truth is that it is not that =
simple to burn karmas and get good results. Without internal transformation=
, external things are meaningless.
 
A kid who wants to drive a car may be =
given a toy car by parents. The kid may play with it and practice with it. =
If one uses the toy car correctly to practice and develop driving skills, i=
t will be useful when one gets a real car. If one does not develop any skil=
ls and keeps feeling proud of what a nice toy car one has, it does not help=
 one with the real car. One's skills do not develop. The toy is meant for c=
reating skill with the real.
 
Similarly, doing rituals and pilgrimages is =
meant for visualizing god, surrendering to god, overcoming pride and self-i=
mportance, get the mind of impermanent things and focus on the permanent (i=
.e. god). If one's self-important attitude remains and devotion and humilit=
y do not develop, one's rituals and pilgrimages do not serve much purpose.
=
 
This reminds me of a small incident.
 
Poornaahuti in a homam is supposed=
 to symbolize offering the head (ego!) to the deity and surrender completel=
y (and think "you are the doer and I am just an instrument"). The gentleman=
 conducting a grand homam I went to (he is the head of a religious order in=
 India) talked for a few minutes on how they collected various auspicious m=
aterials for the poornaahuti, how their poornaahuti is so rare and great an=
d how we are all so lucky to witness the poornaahuti offering of such a mat=
chless homam. Such pride and focus on the irrelevant is useless. One is bet=
ter off offering a simple coconut with complete surrender than offering so =
many auspicious materials with such pride.
 
As Ramakrishna says, one who e=
ngages in great rituals, pilgrimages and other austerities recommended by s=
criptures, with the mind still focused on *impermanent* things like money, =
sensual pleasures, name, fame etc, is not making progress. Goal of sadhana =
is to get some control over the mind, take it off impermanent things that i=
t is naturally attracted to and focus it on the imperishable Self (or god).=

 
Best regards,
Narasimha
