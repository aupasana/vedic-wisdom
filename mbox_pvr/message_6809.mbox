Namaste,

> Please do not answer this with answers like "faith" or "fate"

=
When Vivekananda first met Margaret Noble (Sister Nivedita), he told her 
t=
hat religion should not be a matter of "faith", but a matter of 
"experienc=
e". In the beginning, one may start with blind faith, but 
eventually one h=
as to know by experience. Otherwise, it is not of much 
use. The problem in=
 the world right now is that there are many relgions 
led by people who hav=
e not experienced god in any manner and yet leading 
people. This has resul=
ted in people fighting and killing in the name of 
god.

*        *        =
*

Anyway, coming back to your question, I did not say planetary kavachas 
=
are a much. In fact, I said Chandi kavacham and Narayana kavacham are 
bett=
er for most people. In fact, any prayer can protect one, if one does 
with =
enough intensity for enough duration.

*        *        *

I never said or=
 will say that doing a particular ritual or mantra is the 
only way to solv=
e a particular problem or to experience a particular 
aspect of god. Just a=
s one can reach a mountain top from various sides 
using various paths, one=
 can reach god using various paths. God is not 
elsewhere, but within us. B=
ut, the conditioning accumulated thru many 
lives makes us look at things w=
ith attraction and aversion and mind 
vibrates with attraction, aversion, p=
ride, shame, anger, jealosy etc. If 
mind becomes nearly still, one can be =
in bliss and the divine energy 
within expresses outside. The goal of vario=
us relgions is to take the 
mind to that state.

There are many ways to fac=
ilitate that. Chanting a sacred combinations 
of syllables with a focused m=
ind is one way. In my opinion, one can 
achieve one-pointedness of mind wit=
h any syllable combination. Mind 
achieving one-pointedness with any mantra=
 and/or mental imagery is a 
good thing. But depending the mantra/imagery, =
a different kind of energy 
envelopes that focused mind, purifies it and af=
fects it. It just so 
happens that many great realized yogis came on the bl=
essed land of India 
and cataloged many mantras and imagery. In other relig=
ions also, many 
people have experienced one-pointedness of mind on a 
thou=
ght/imagery/sound combination and experienced divinity. A muslim can 
take =
a surah from Quran and meditate with it. In fact, some sufi saints 
did exp=
erience divinity like that. Also, there are paths other than 
meditation. S=
erving others and trying to see god in all is a valid path 
too. Oneday, mi=
nd can experience god that way too.

While other areas of the world had the=
ir share of realized souls, India 
had just too many of them. What is known=
 today as Hinduism has a rich 
library of knowledge from their experiences =
and revelations. One can try 
a path that was traversed by others and is we=
ll-understood. It does not 
mean those on the other side of the mountain ar=
e doomed.

*        *        *

> doing homams or not doing homams or any o=
ther hindu worship method

Japam and homam are not the monopoly of any reli=
gion and not just "Hindu 
worship methods". People who meditated with speci=
al chants and 
experienced ecstasy, bliss and inner divinity came in every =
part of the 
world and in every religion.

As for homam, sacredness of fire=
 and the ability to connect to the 
divine faster when using fire, was know=
n to many religions. Not only 
Hindus, but native Americans worshipped god =
in fire, Zoroastrians did 
it, ancient Greco-Romans did it, some Buddhists =
did it, some south 
Americans did it, some Scandinavians did it, and so on.=
 There are 
references in Bible of even Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Mos=
es having 
worshipped god in fire. For example, GENESIS 8:20 says "And Noah=
 builded 
an altar unto the Lord; and took of every clean beast, and of eve=
ry 
clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar". The Korban Olah =

("whole offering") of Judaism, where a whole animal was burnt in fire, 
is=
 very similar to "poornaahuti" (whole offering) of homam where a full 
coco=
nut symbolizing head or ego is burnt in fire. The seven candles of 
minorah=
, an integral part of judaism, remind us of the seven tongues of 
Agni.

Ne=
w Testament refers to baptism with fire (baptism is purification by 
sprink=
ling or dipping in holy water). John the Baptist says, "I indeed 
baptize y=
ou with water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is 
mightier t=
han I =E2=80=93 He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire." 
(MATTH=
EW 3:11). Purification with fire is superior to purification with 
water. N=
ote that fire is clubbed with Holy Spirit here. In Veda also, 
fire is used=
 as a symbol of Self.

Many seekers in many religions achieved the ascensio=
n of individual 
consciousness into cosmic consciousness using the medium o=
f fire. With 
advancing Kali yuga, knowledge has given way to ignorance in =
many 
religions and now finally in Hinduism too! However, a Satya yuga like=
 
sub-period within Kali yuga is coming again.

BTW, the under construction=
 website http://FireYoga.net has some more 
information along these lines.
