Namaste,
 
All are children only - those who talk, those who listen and tho=
se who are confused.
 
The crux of my mail was that knowledge of technicali=
ties and nuances is not that useful and one needs to develop surrender and =
devotion. If you understand that much, the rest in my mail does not matter =
much.
 
The great Adi Shankara said "bhaja govindam bhaja govindam bhaja go=
vindam moodhamate, sampraapte sannihite kaale na hi na hi rakshati dunkrun =
karane". It approximately means "O fool, pray to the Lord, pray to the Lord=
, pray to the Lord. When your time is up, all these technicalities and know=
ledge do not save you."
 
*        *        *
 
Until ego melts in the heat=
 of true and perfect knowledge (half-knowledge is useless and promotes more=
 ego) or until ego is washed away by the cool and steady stream of unwaveri=
ng devotion of a totally surrendered mind, one is stuck in maya (delusion) =
and suffers. One is saved only when one of the two happens. The former is v=
ery very difficult in this age. One gets a little bit of knowledge and then=
 pride increases. It is very difficult to maintain humility and achieve pur=
ity through knowledge alone.
 
The latter is an easier path in this age. Su=
rrender to a deity and look at yourself as a servant of that deity. When th=
e deity gives you something, do not let it increase your pride and think of=
 everything as a property of the deity and continue to look at yourself as =
a servant of the deity.
 
*        *        *
 
Whatever path you choose, d=
o some sadhana practically and on a regular basis. Without that, it is diff=
icult to progress.
 
Also, do not look at sadhana as an half hour or one ho=
ur or two hour thing. The meditation or pooja or homam or some other ritual=
 you do alone is not sadhana. Every thought and action is a part of your sa=
dhana. Install a 24 hour surveillance camera to alert you when thieves call=
ed pride and ego enter the home called your heart. Constant contemplation t=
o control the mind should be as much a part of one's sadhana as meditation =
or pooja or homam or a ritual.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

          Dear Sundeep,

          As you eloquently say, "if mantra is to=
 have ANY enlightening effect, mantra 
          must resonate in the mind =
itself". You are correct that "we are no longer 
          talking about ph=
ysical energy (sound), we are talking of non-material mental 
          ene=
rgy - the mental equivalent of sound in the mind".

          Mind is the c=
onnection between what you called external universe and what 
          you=
 called the deeper non-material universe. Mind has access to ALL realms 
  =
        of experience, but it normally focuses on the physical/material rea=
lm. 
          Though mind can theretically be focused on ANY realm of expe=
rience through 
          effort, it is not easy.

          Let me give a =
small analogy.

          If Brahman is like the ocean bed, supreme cosmic =
being (who thinks all that 
          all of us think, who desires all that=
 all of us desire, who knows all that 
          all of us know, and who do=
es all that all of us do) is like the bottommost 
          layer of ocean.=
 Various deities are like intermediate layers. Various 
          objects o=
f the external material world that are perceived by our senses are 
       =
   like the ripples on the surface of the ocean. Objects on the surface 
  =
        perceive other objects on the surface around them. One's body and t=
he senses 
          attached to it are an object on the surface in the ana=
logy. When one's mind 
          identifies "self" with that body and its s=
enses, it perceives objects as 
          perceived by those senses. When o=
ne successfully detaches mind from that 
          self-identity and identi=
fies with another object in the ocean in a different 
          layer, one =
may perceive a different reality. An example was in yesterday's 
          =
mail on mystical experiences.

          Just as the ocean is vast and deep=
 and has infinite objects at infinite 
          depths, this universe has =
infinite possible self-identities. As one's 
          self-awareness is fo=
cused on a specific object, one has specific 
          experience/percepti=
 on of self and "others". When self-awareness changes to a 
          diffe=
rent object, one has a different experience/percepti on of self and 
      =
    "others". However, this is theoretical discussion for most people, as t=
hey 
          cannot imagine self-awareness changing. The self-awareness o=
f most people is 
          focused on their body with its senses and their=
 experience/percepti on of 
          self is the body and "others" is vari=
ous objects as perceived through the 
          senses attached to that bod=
y. But, it IS possible for one's self-awareness 
          to go from an ob=
ject on the ocean surface in the analogy to a layer in the 
          mdidl=
e of the ocean or even a bottommost layer.

          Repetition of a mantr=
a is only a tool for calming down the mental activity 
          that keeps=
 feeding this self-awareness. Mind is identifying with a physical 
        =
  object made with gross matter (body). By keeping it busy with a particula=
r 
          repetitive activity, you have a chance of cutting off its iden=
tification 
          with that object. As an analogy, suppose a kid saw a =
rope right next to him 
          and thought it was a snake and was scared=
. You may tell him no, but still 
          the thought "snake is next to m=
e" will keep scaring him. If you keep him 
          busy with an activity =
that he immerses in, the thought of snake next to him 
          may vanish=
 from his mind slowly.

          Once the identification of mind with the =
body is cut off or weakened, mind 
          will have to identify with som=
ething else. Imagine a frog clinging to a rock 
          on an ocean surfa=
ce. If it is afraid of slipping and holds on the rock 
          tightly, i=
ts thoughts are on the rock always. If the frog stops thinking 
          a=
bout rock and becomes absorbed in some other thoughts, it may slip from the=
 
          rock. If it starts sinking in the ocean, it will get hold of so=
mething else 
          on the way to the ocean bed (otherwise, it will dro=
p all the way to the 
          ocean bed. Though that is not a bad thing a=
t all, the frog is afraid of it 
          and instinctively grabs somethin=
g on the way!!). Like in that analogy, mind 
          will get a hold of a=
nother object (on the way to ocean bed, i.e. Brahman) 
          and develo=
p another self-awareness, i.e. a perception of "I" and "others". 
         =
 In the example from last night, the perception of "I" was not the body, bu=
t 
          a tiny particle in a tremendous wave of energy that reverberat=
ed with the 
          sound of a beejaakshara. The perception of "others" =
was millions of 
          particles of the same wave of energy engaged in =
making the same sound and 
          aborbed in the same sound.

          =
Let me come back to what you wrote: "if mantra is to have ANY enlightening =

          effect, mantra must resonate in the mind itself. ... We are no l=
onger 
          talking about physical energy (sound), we are talking of n=
on-material mental 
          energy - the mental equivalent of sound in th=
e mind."

          Mind or individualized consciousness is just a window t=
o the universe. If a 
          room has window on the east, you see what i=
s on the east. If a room has 
          window on the west, you see what is=
 on the west. And so on. The sound of the 
          mantra IS resonating s=
omewhere (actually, everywhere) in the universe. A 
          mind with a s=
trong self-identification with a body is bombarded by the sense 
          =
inputs of that body, just as a room with an open window on the south is 
  =
        filled with cold wind blowing from the south and bombarded by the 
=
          floodlights installed outside on the south. You have to close tha=
t window 
          and open window elsewhere to get something else. If sel=
f-identification with 
          body is weakened, the bombardment of sense=
 inputs weakens and the window of 
          mind can open to the mantra th=
at resonates in the universe.

          When I said earlier that a vaccum =
should be created in the mind for the 
          mantra and the deity to fi=
ll, this is what I was referring to.

          * * *

          Different =
objects of the universe, including human beings and deities, are 
         =
 made up of gross/subtle matters of different gunas. Each object of the 
  =
        universe has different perceptions of "I" and "others". Each object=
 of the 
          universe has different energies, i.e. different abilitie=
s to affect 
          interactions between "I" and "others".

          Th=
e energy of an object is the energy that brought that object into being. 
 =
         Deities are objects with tremendous energy. But one cannot get clo=
se to a 
          deity unless one overcomes attachment to individualized =
ego and its 
          potential energy. One needs to convert that potentia=
l energy into kinetic 
          energy that helps one break away from that=
 ego and approach a deity.

          In the long run, none of those object=
s is permanent. None of those energies 
          is permanent. In terms of=
 the previous ocean analogy, one may cling on to an 
          object on th=
e way to the ocean bed temporarily, but the final goal is to not 
         =
 view any object as "I" and not consider any energy as "mine". The final go=
al 
          is to drop down all the way to the ocean bed and stay there, =
without any 
          sense of "I" and "others" or "energy".

          * =
* *

          Please realize two fundamental things:

          (1) The en=
ergy of the mantra is experienced *after* the sadhana is fruitful 
        =
  and one overcomes ego. The mantra is an indirect tool for overcoming ego.=
 If 
          one thinks that he is doing a powerful mantra and its energy=
 will free him 
          from ego, one is mistakened. One MUST put in cons=
cious effort with constant 
          contemplation to weed out ego and pri=
de to make one's sadhana fruitful. 
          Mantra does not replace that =
need. Instead, it works hands in hand with that 
          and depends on t=
hat.

          (2) When one succeeds in overcoming ego and experiencing a =
mantra, one 
          should not think that "I did it" or "I created that =
energy in my mind". One 
          does not do anything (other than *undoin=
g* what one did previously, viz 
          putting together of a complex an=
d weird self-identity called a body with so 
          many things attached=
 to it and so many pre-conceived notions about the 
          world). The e=
nergy of the mantra IS already there and resonating everywhere. 
          =
When mind experiences that energy and fills with it, it is simply *tuning* =

          to something pre-existing and not really creating something or d=
oing 
          something. It is like a radio tuning to a different channel=
 and one 
          listening to newer and better music or a driver driving=
 on a different 
          scenic road and viewing beautiful and better sce=
nery.

          * * *

          > If all repetitive chanting were equal, =
mantra shastra would be
          > 1/2 a page of text, not more.

        =
  I never said they were equal. Perfect absorption into different mantras 
=
          fills the mind with different kinds of enegies (associated with d=
ifferent 
          deities). So there is a lot of difference to chronicle.=
 In terms of my ocean 
          analogy, the possible experiences when one=
 is absorbed into a mantra are as 
          vast as an ocean.

          B=
ut, the essence is this: Mind has to be perfectlty absorbed into the mantra=
 
          and a vacuum has to be created in the mind for the mantra and i=
ts deity to 
          fill. Other factors related to the specific details =
in each mantra are 
          secondary. I want to de-emphasize all other t=
hings and emphasize this 
          essential thing, i.e. control over ego.=


          One wanting to drive a car on various roads needs a detailed bo=
ok giving all 
          the maps. But my point is that one should first le=
arn driving. What makes 
          one an expert driver going to various pl=
aces is not possession of thousand 
          maps but the basic driving sk=
ill. One not knowing driving will crash the car 
          even if he posse=
sses thousand maps. One good at driving may manage without 
          maps =
too. People emphasize complicated, mystified and nuanced knowledge and 
   =
       forget the basic essence.

          * * *

          I want to cate=
gorically state that the nuances of mantra shastra are neither 
          n=
ecessary nor sufficient for one to achieve spiritual progress. One may 
   =
       spend decades learning the nuances and yet not achieve anything.

  =
        If the basic essence is paid attention to, one can achieve despite =
not 
          knowing the nuances. In fact, the nuances may come naturally=
 to one who gets 
          some mastery over the essential factors.

     =
     The proof of the pudding is in eating it. Choose any mantra or beejaak=
shara 
          and meditate on it silently everyday, for 2 hours (atleast=
 one hour). Sit 
          comfortably with the back, neck and head erect, =
eyes closed and mind as calm 
          as possible. Avoid all physical mov=
ement and remain as still as you can. If 
          you have an urge to mov=
e, suppress it as long as you can and keep pushing 
          the limit eve=
ryday. Try your best to focus the mind on mantra. Do this 
          medita=
tion sitting in the same place, facing the same direction and at 
         =
 around the same time everyday. Do this for one year and see for yourself i=
f 
          it does something to you or not, despite not paying attention =
to the 
          technicalities and nuances!

          * * *

          S=
ome nuances are not irrelevant completely. But they are irrelevant to most =

          people. For example, people religiously mention beeja, shakti an=
d keelaka of 
          the mantra and do detailed anga nyaasa and kara nya=
asa. Those are all 
          relevant only to a person of a high level of =
self-awareness, which is not 
          the case with most people.

       =
   Let me give an analogy. There may be some nuances related to how to lift=
 the 
          foot up and land the foot while running, to maximize the sp=
eed. They are 
          irrelevant to a small baby who cannot yet walk and=
 only crawls. When the 
          baby learns how to walk and later how to =
run, those details will most likely 
          come to him naturally. Evem =
without them, one will run fine, perhaps a 
          little
          slow=
er. Thus, there is no point in trying to learn the nuances of running 
    =
      when one is still crawling. In fact, unneeded focus on those nuances =
of 
          running may even make one's learning of walking very slow - i=
t is a 
          distraction!

          * * *

          I answered whate=
ver questions I could answer and felt like answering.

          What we ne=
ed today is not people who can discuss theory in detail and have 
         =
 an intellectual understanding of things. In fact, these things are beyond =

          intellectual comprehension. Practical sadhana is far more import=
ant. Do not 
          wait till you get technicalities correct. Just start=
 sadhana as I mentioned 
          earlier and commit 1-2 hours of your tim=
e everyday and see what happens.

          What sanatana dharma and Vedic =
wisdom need today is a handful of sadhakas 
          who *experience* mant=
ras at the highest level and yet remain free from pride 
          and ego =
and become purified instruments of the Mother to carry out Her will 
      =
    with actions of far-reaching consequences without a trace of ego in tho=
se 
          actions. This is possible not by learning technicalities and =
nuances, but by 
          developing devotion, surrender and conscious eff=
ort with constant 
          contemplation.

          <DIV>Dear Sundeep,<BR><BR>As you eloquen=
tly say, "if mantra is to have 
          ANY enlightening effect, mantra <=
BR>must resonate in the mind itself". 
          You are correct that "we a=
re no longer <BR>talking about physical 
          energy (sound), we are t=
alking of non-material mental <BR>energy - the 
          mental equivalent=
 of sound in the mind".<BR><BR>Mind is the connection 
          between wh=
at you called external universe and what <BR>you called the 
          deep=
er non-material universe. Mind has access to ALL realms <BR>of 
          e=
xperience, but it normally focuses on the physical/material realm. 
       =
   <BR>Though mind can theretically be focused on ANY realm of experience 
=
          through <BR>effort, it is not easy.<BR><BR>Let me give a small 
 =
         analogy.<BR><BR>If Brahman is like the ocean bed, supreme cosmic b=
eing 
          (who thinks all that <BR>all of us think, who desires all t=
hat all of 
          us desire, who knows all that <BR>all of us know, and=
 who does all 
          that all of us do) is like the bottommost <BR>laye=
r of ocean. Various 
          deities are like intermediate layers. Variou=
s <BR>objects of the 
          external material world that are perceived =
by our senses are <BR>like 
          the ripples on the surface of the oce=
an. Objects on the surface 
          <BR>perceive other objects on the sur=
face around them. One's body and 
          the senses <BR>attached to it a=
re an object on the surface in the 
          analogy. When one's mind <BR>=
identifies "self" with that body and its 
          senses, it perceives ob=
jects as <BR>perceived by those senses. When 
          one successfully de=
taches mind from that <BR>self-identity and 
          identifies with anot=
her object in the ocean in a different <BR>layer, 
          one may percei=
ve a different reality. An example was in yesterday's 
          <BR>mail o=
n mystical experiences.<BR><BR>Just as the ocean is vast and 
          dee=
p and has infinite objects at infinite <BR>depths, this universe 
         =
 has infinite possible self-identities. As one's <BR>self-awareness is 
   =
       focused on a specific object, one has specific <BR>experience/percep=
ti 
          on of self and "others". When self-awareness changes to a 
  =
        <BR>different object, one has a different experience/percepti on of=
 
          self and <BR>"others". However, this is theoretical discussion =
for 
          most people, as they <BR>cannot imagine self-awareness chang=
ing. The 
          self-awareness of most people is <BR>focused on their b=
ody with its 
          senses and their experience/percepti on of <BR>self=
 is the body and 
          "others" is various objects as perceived throug=
h the <BR>senses 
          attached to that body. But, it IS possible for =
one's self-awareness 
          <BR>to go from an object on the ocean surfa=
ce in the analogy to a 
          layer in the <BR>mdidle of the ocean or e=
ven a bottommost 
          layer.<BR><BR>Repetition of a mantra is only a =
tool for calming down 
          the mental activity <BR>that keeps feeding=
 this self-awareness. Mind 
          is identifying with a physical <BR>ob=
ject made with gross matter 
          (body). By keeping it busy with a pa=
rticular <BR>repetitive activity, 
          you have a chance of cutting o=
ff its identification <BR>with that 
          object. As an analogy, suppo=
se a kid saw a rope right next to him 
          <BR>and thought it was a s=
nake and was scared. You may tell him no, 
          but still <BR>the thou=
ght "snake is next to me" will keep scaring him. 
          If you keep him=
 <BR>busy with an activity that he immerses in, the 
          thought of s=
nake next to him <BR>may vanish from his mind 
          slowly.<BR><BR>Onc=
e the identification of mind with the body is cut 
          off or weakene=
d, mind <BR>will have to identify with something else. 
          Imagine a=
 frog clinging to a rock <BR>on an ocean surface. If it is 
          afrai=
d of slipping and holds on the rock <BR>tightly, its thoughts are 
        =
  on the rock always. If the frog stops thinking <BR>about rock and 
      =
    becomes absorbed in some other thoughts, it may slip from the 
        =
  <BR>rock. If it starts sinking in the ocean, it will get hold of 
       =
   something else <BR>on the way to the ocean bed (otherwise, it will 
    =
      drop all the way to the <BR>ocean bed. Though that is not a bad thing=
 
          at all, the frog is afraid of it <BR>and instinctively grabs so=
mething 
          on the way!!). Like in that analogy, mind <BR>will get a=
 hold of 
          another object (on the way to ocean bed, i.e. Brahman) =
<BR>and develop 
          another self-awareness, i.e. a perception of "I"=
 and "others". <BR>In 
          the example from last night, the perceptio=
n of "I" was not the body, 
          but <BR>a tiny particle in a tremendo=
us wave of energy that 
          reverberated with the <BR>sound of a beej=
aakshara. The perception of 
          "others" was millions of <BR>particl=
es of the same wave of energy 
          engaged in making the same sound a=
nd <BR>aborbed in the same 
          sound.<BR><BR>Let me come back to wha=
t you wrote: "if mantra is to 
          have ANY enlightening <BR>effect, =

          itself. ... We are no longer <B=

          consciousness is just a w=
indow to the universe. If a <BR>room has 
          window on the east, you=
 see what is on the east. If a room has 
          <BR>window on the west, =
you see what is on the west. And so on. The 
          sound of the <BR>man=
tra IS resonating somewhere (actually, everywhere) 
          in the univer=
se. A <BR>mind with a strong self-identification with a

bombarded by the sense <BR>inputs of that body, just as a room

ith an open window on the south is <BR>filled with cold wind blowing

     from the south and bombarded by the <BR>floodlights installed outside =

          on the south. You have to close that window <BR>and open window =

          elsewhere to get something else. If self-identification with <BR=

          is weakened, the bombardment of sense inputs weakens and t=
he window of 
          <BR>mind can open to the mantra that resonates in t=

          universe.<BR><BR>When I said earlier that a vaccum should be =
created 
          in the mind for the <BR>mantra and the deity to fill, th=
is is what I 
          was referring to.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Different obj=
ects of the 
          universe, including human beings and deities, are <B=
R>made up of 
          gross/subtle matters of different gunas. Each objec=
t of the 
          <BR>universe has different perceptions of "I" and "othe=
rs". Each 
          object of the <BR>universe has different energies, i.e=
. different 
          abilities to affect <BR>interactions between "I" and=
 
          "others".<BR><BR>The energy of an object is the energy that bro=
ught 
          that object into being. <BR>Deities are objects with tremen=
dous 
          energy. But one cannot get close to a <BR>deity unless one =
overcomes 
          attachment to individualized ego and its <BR>potential=
 energy. One 
          needs to convert that potential energy into kinetic=
 <BR>energy that 
          helps one break away from that ego and approach=
 a deity.<BR><BR>In the 
          long run, none of those objects is perma=
nent. None of those energies 
          <BR>is permanent. In terms of the p=
revious ocean analogy, one may 
          cling on to an <BR>object on the =
way to the ocean bed temporarily, but 
          the final goal is to not <=
BR>view any object as "I" and not consider 
          any energy as "mine".=
 The final goal <BR>is to drop down all the way 
          to the ocean bed=
 and stay there, without any <BR>sense of "I" and 
          "others" or "e=
nergy".<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Please realize two 
          fundamental thing=
s:<BR><BR>(1) The energy of the mantra is experienced 
          *after* th=
e sadhana is fruitful <BR>and one overcomes ego. The mantra 
          is a=
n indirect tool for overcoming ego. If <BR>one thinks that he is 
         =
 doing a powerful mantra and its energy will free him <BR>from ego, one 
  =
        is mistakened. One MUST put in conscious effort with constant 
    =
      <BR>contemplation to weed out ego and pride to make one's sadhana 
  =
        fruitful. <BR>Mantra does not replace that need. Instead, it works =

          hands in hand with that <BR>and depends on that.<BR><BR>(2) When=
 one 
          succeeds in overcoming ego and experiencing a mantra, one <=
BR>should 
          not think that "I did it" or "I created that energy in=
 my mind". One 
          <BR>does not do anything (other than *undoing* wh=
at one did 
          previously, viz <BR>putting together of a complex and=
 weird 
          self-identity called a body with so <BR>many things attac=
hed to it and 
          so many pre-conceived notions about the <BR>world)=
. The energy of the 
          mantra IS already there and resonating every=
where. <BR>When mind 
          experiences that energy and fills with it, =
it is simply *tuning* 
          <BR>to something pre-existing and not real=
ly creating something or 
          doing <BR>something. It is like a radio=
 tuning to a different channel 
          and one <BR>listening to newer an=

          in the mind=
 for the mantra and its deity to <BR>fill. Other factors

 nuances are 
          not irrelevant completely. But they are irrelevant =
to most <BR>people. 
          For example, people religiously mention beej=

          <BR>the mantra and do detailed anga nya=
asa and kara nyaasa. Those are 
          all <BR>relevant only to a person=

          which is not <BR>the case wi=

          <BR>irrelevant =
to a small baby who cannot yet walk and only crawls. 
          When the <B=

          the<BR>> ref=
lecting/consider ing/theorizing mind that we are all so 
          familiar=
<BR>> with. It experiences the quintuplicated universe, yet 
          i=

     =
     deeper level, even<BR>> this subtle body is a manifestation of the =

The 
          manifesting/ enlivening agent,<BR>> so to speak, is the n=
on-dual 
          Brahman, or pure undifferentiated<BR>> 
          con=

      =
    do mantra and diety figure?<BR>> Spoken/chanted/ heard mantra is 
  =
        nothing more than an "energic"<BR>> activity of the most externa=
l 
          part of the universe i.e. the<BR>> quintuplicated tattwa un=
iverse. 
          Clearly this energic activity by<BR>> itself, *if* li=
mited to the 
          quintuplicated universe, is useless. So,<BR>> cl=
early, we must 
          accept that if mantra is to have ANY enlightening=
<BR>> effect, 
          mantra must resonate in the mind itself, which =
is part of<BR>> the 
          antahakarana. Right? Now, since mind itse=
lf is NON-material,<BR>> 
          what does resonate mean at the mind =
level? We are no longer 
          talking<BR>> about physical energy (s=
ound), we are talking of 
          non-material mental<BR>> energy - th=
e mental equivalent of sound in 
          the mind.<BR>><BR>> It is =
this non-material mental energy that I 
          wish to understand when<B=
R>> I ask about mantras and beejaksharas. 
          What is this energy=
? Is it<BR>> tattwa, prana, chitta, ahamkara, 
          manas, karma, w=
hat? Why do specific<BR>> harmonics of it correspond 
          to speci=
fic dieties? What exactly *is* a<BR>> diety in terms of the 
          a=
bove terminology? What is the cause-effect<BR>> relationship 
          =
between harmonics of this energy and the disintegration<BR>> of the 
   =
       subtle and causal bodies.<BR>><BR>> Hope you appreciate the
