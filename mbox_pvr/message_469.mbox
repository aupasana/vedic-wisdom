            Namaste,



Choosing the right deit=
y for sadhana is important. If you do not know the 

right deity, just doin=
g some sadhana is definitely better than waiting. Pick 

whatever deity see=
ms natural to you and do sadhana.



Please remember that sadhana for spiri=
tual progress is different from 

sadhana for specific material benefits. N=
o matter which deity you worship, 

sadhana performed for spiritual progres=
s never goes waste. However, 

sometimes it may be necessary to experience =
the results of some bad karmas 

before some good things happen. Imagine al=
l your karmas lying in a pile in a 

basket. Suppose some of the really goo=
d karmas that will enable you to do 

serious sadhana and experience great =
things lie at the bottom or middle of 

the pile. When you start sadhana, s=
uppose god decides to give you the fruits 

of those auspicious karmas. Ima=
gine him reaching into the pile and 

retrieving those karmas. In the proce=
ss, some other karmas may spill over 

and give their fruits. Some of those=
 may be undesirable. So what? They had 

to be experienced sometime or the =
other, anyway!



A serious sadhaka should never be disheartened by a few s=
eemingly 

undesirable results after starting a spiritual sadhana. Just kee=
p going.



One gentleman I know received mantra for Kaali from a very good=
 

priest-cum-yogi in late 2005. After he did the mantra for a few days, he=
 was 

laid off and lost his job. He was not perturbed. He continued his sa=
dhana 

and used the break to go on an extended trip to India and make a pi=
lgrimage 

to some nice places. He participated in the Shata Chandi homam w=
e conducted 

at the Kaalikambal temple in Chennai in March 2006. He met my=
 guru and got 

the opportunity to be his room mate for a week when we stay=
ed at the house 

of a priest during the homam. He could observe and intera=
ct with my guru 

very closely. Most importantly, when my guru had a vision=
 of the Mother on 

2006 March 3 afternoon, in which She told him to start =
the work on spreading 

homam in the world, this gentleman was present ther=
e. Though he could not 

see the Mother, he actually smelled something out =
of the world and was 

baffled. He knew something was going on, but did not=
 know what. The temple 

was closed at the time and my guru and this gentle=
men were the only people 

on the premises when the Mother appeared. Even t=
hough he could not see the 

Mother, it was most fortunate of him to be pre=
sent there at *that* crucial 

moment. That is enough to mould the rest of =
his life.



You never know how, when and where the grace of god falls on y=
ou. 

Calculations and logic are useless when it comes to the grace of god.=
 Just 

surrender and keep doing whatever sadhana you picked. If it needs 
=

fine-tuning, somebody will appear to tell you that. Any bad things that 

=
happen when doing a spiritual sadhana should be viewed as nature settling 
=

some debts so that you are prepared to receive the fruits of some really 
=

auspicious karmas.



As Shirdi Sai Baba says, you should have "sraddha an=
d saburi". Have devotion 

and patience. There is no limit to what you can =
get then.



Best regards,

Narasimha
