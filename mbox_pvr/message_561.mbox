Namaste,

It is far better to stick to one deity and one homam and do it every 
day/week/fortnight/month for a duration of time. It is a bad idea to do a 
different homam everyday.

Ramakrishna Paramahamsa used to say "if you want, dig deep in one place. 
Don't dig one foot in one place, another foot in another place and so on".

Pick one deity and one homam and do it continuously for a few months 
atleast. It will do something then.

Amavasya is good for worshipping Kaali or Mahalakshmi. Especially 
Deepavali/Diwali is a great day to worship Mahalakshmi. So Her homam is a 
good idea.

Best regards,
Narasimha
