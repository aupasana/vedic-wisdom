I do not say that it should not be repeated. One can of course repeat it 
also. But my *recommendation* is to repeat embedded in just om.

One may note that bhuH, bhuvaH and suvaH are offered to Agni (fire), Vaayu 
(wind) and Surya (sun), who control the physical, conscious and spiritual 
realms of existence. Agni transforms matter and enables the everything in 
the physical realm. Vaayu causes movement and enables all the activities of 
consciousness. Surya is the all-filling soul of the universe and the lord of 
the spiritual realm. This is why offerings are made to Agni, Vayu and Surya 
in homam using om bhuuH svaahaa, om bhuvaH svaahaa and om suvaH svaahaa 
(respectively).

One can remember the three realms of existence with *each* repetition of the 
mantra or one can just declare it once and focus on the mantra itself. Both 
are fine. The exact thought (or the point of contemplation) suggested by the 
two approaches is slightly different.

If one can contemplate each time that "the physical, conscious and spiritual 
realms - all are filled with the effulgence of great Savita", then one can 
repeat "om bhuurbhuvassuvaH" each time. Though I recommend just repeating 
the main mantra to keep the focus of contemplation simpler, I cannot say 
that the other way is wrong.

Best regards,
Narasimha
