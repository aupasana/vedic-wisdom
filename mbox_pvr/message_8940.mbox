Namaste,

Making offerings to pitris in fire in a homam does not replace pi=
tri 
tarpana. They serve different purposes.

You may recall from Jyotisha =
that horas (halves of zodiacal signs) are 
owned by Sun and Moon and respec=
tively ruled by devas (gods) and pitris 
(ancestral manes). You may also re=
call from Jyotisha that lagna, Moon 
and Sun shows physical body, mind and =
soul respectively. Human beings 
identify more with their body; pitris iden=
tify more with their mind and 
its desires; and, devas identify more with t=
heir individual soul.

Offerings in fire reach/affect the soul more (Sun). =
Offerings through 
water reach/affect the mind more (Moon). So homam is bes=
t for devas and 
tarpana is best for pitris.

However, though a deva may id=
entify more with soul than mind, there will 
be SOME identification with mi=
nd and desires too. So, tarpana can be 
given to devas too (actually, pitri=
 tarpana manual includes deva tarpana 
too). Similarly, though pitris ident=
ify more with mind and its desires, 
there will be SOME identification with=
 soul too. So offerings can be 
made in fire.

BTW, someone asked about Jay=
aadi homam that is sometimes done at the 
start of uttarangam of any homam.=
 Offerings to pitris with a Veda mantra 
are included in that procedure!

T=
o answer your last question, I am not aware of any restrctions.

Best regar=
ds,
Narasimha
