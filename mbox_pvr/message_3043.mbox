Namaste,
 
Savikalpa samadhi is not due to nirguna brahman. It is absorptio=
n in a saguna form.
 
Sahaja samadhi is also not nirguna. It is a perceptio=
n of nirguna and saguna as one and the same.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

  Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] On Sahaja Sa=
madhi (Re: AOL: Seamless blend...)

        This life is like a long dream.=
 Saviklapa samadhi is like waking up *within* the dream. Nirvikalpa samadhi=
 is like waking up from the dream. Sahaja samadhi is like being in the drea=
m and yet being awake.

        Hello,
                 These states seem t=
o be due to Nirgun Brahman. Personally I believe there are other states of =
similar nature due to Sagun Brahman. And there is Deep Grace and Love and B=
eauty and Fragrance to name a few, are involved here. It is difficult for m=
e to give them any name so I will describe them in brief.

        When Div=
ine Father appears in a normal waking state and physical eyes perceive Him,=
 one goes in to a mindless bewilderment of astonishment and deep happiness.=


        When Divine Mother appears and the Light from Her Aura has penetr=
ated ones head /skull, senses become totally numb. Yet one is fully awake w=
ith physical. eyes open. If She would allow  more Light, one would faint bu=
t She stops it before it happens.
        And these states can not be easil=
y describe in words although there are subject and object.  Nirverkalpa can=
not be described. I do not know how savikalpa or sahaja feels like, so I ca=
nnot compare them.

        Is it sill a dream??  Yes, because one is someh=
ow going about his daily business as usual. Pain and arguments and other te=
nsion of life.

        Is it still a dream?? No, because certain things ha=
ve changed completely. DivineBeloveds and their Bliss are EverPresent.

   =
     Some lucky person from this group went to several Temples in Assam and=
 Calcutta recently. Notice the bliss and joy flowing from her letter. How m=
uch happy she felt at  Temples when she was in presence of Divine Mother.Th=
is blissful state is nothing less than a samadhi.Afterall Divine Mother is =
Sagun Brahman.

        I do not know her.Otherwise I could have sent her a=
 cheque for some money for purchase of fresh Dhoop and asked her to light t=
hem at temples which she visited for this group. Most of people here are wa=
lking consciousely on spiritual path. As the fragrance would have reached M=
other , Her shimmering grace could have filled us with Her Love. 

        =
Thanks,
        LaxmiNarayan
