Searching for Mother (a poem)
=A0
PVR Narasimha Rao
2012 July 13
=A0
Like a=
 mad man, I was searching for Mother
Here and there, Everywhere
=A0
I read =
many books,
I contemplated so much,
I saw many scholars,
I saw many saints,=

But I did not find Her
=A0
Like a mad man, I was looking for Mother
Here a=
nd there, Everywhere
=A0
I went to many temples,
I did many rituals,
I trie=
d many spiritual paths,
I did much meditation,
But I did not find Her
=A0
L=
ike a mad man, I was looking for Mother
Here and there, Everywhere
=A0
Then=
 I realized what was wrong
=A0
I was restricting Mother
To what my mind cou=
ld conceive - 
A specific form with so many arms,
A specific type of Light,=

A specific type of Energy,
A specific ability to do this or that.


While =
looking for that form,
I missed out on Her
Though She was right in front of=
 me
And in fact all around me
In so many beautiful forms -
Some simple, som=
e complex
=A0
What makes a plant grow
And give flowers and fruits,
If not H=
er energy?
=A0
What makes a flower bloom
And attract the bees,
If not Her e=
nergy?
=A0
What attracts the bees
To the blooming flower,
If not Her energy=
?
=A0
What makes earth and
Planets go around Sun,
If not Her energy?
=A0
Wh=
at makes electrons in atoms
Go around the nucleus,
If not Her energy?
=A0
W=
hat makes zillions of beings,
Zillions of atoms in them,
And zillions of su=
b-aromic particles
Exist in a harmonious balance,
If not Her energy?
=A0
Wh=
at makes the us crave things,
What makes the us do things,
What makes the u=
s understand things,
If not Her energy?
=A0
Isn't She in the contentment of=
 a baby
Who just received milk from Mother?
Isn't She in the love of Mother=

Who just fed her baby?
Isn't She in the curiosity of a young toddler
About=
 what is on the other side of a door?
Isn't She in the laughters & cries,
H=
unger & contentment, pleasures & pains
Of zillions of beings in this cosmos=
?
=A0
Now when I look around me,
I see Her all around me.
I marvel at every=
 little thing,
And every big thing,
As things of Her doing
And as signs of =
Her presence.
=A0
I realized my mistake now..
=A0
If you restrict Her to th=
is or that definition,
You may not find Her however hard you may try
=A0
Sh=
e is the Force that creates, sustains & recycles
Every being, every aspect =
of every being
And every notion in the consciousness of every being
In this=
 limitless cosmos!
=A0
I realized my mistake now..
=A0
You don't search for=
 air with a microscope,
Air is all around us,
You just open your lungs to a=
ir and breath it!
=A0
Same with Mother!
She is all around us,
Just open you=
r heart to Her!
=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha
