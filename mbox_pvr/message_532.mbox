Dear Sriram
=C2=A0
Thank you for the post. Really wonderful. Infact this ex=
planation is very very similar to the explanation that Lahiri Mahasaya had =
given to some his disciples and people who used to come to him. There were =
two entries in Lahiri Mahasays diaries, which were later discovered by peop=
le after Lahiri Mahasaya had left his mortal body, where he mentions one ni=
ght he had been doing the kriya all night and he saw the ten mahavidyas man=
ifesting infornt of him one after the other, and he understood what each on=
e really means and what is the yogic link.
=C2=A0
Also Sri Bhaskarananda Sw=
araswati was one of the saints from a different lineage who had come to Lah=
iri Mahasaya for higher level kriyas. The other person was Balananda Brahma=
chari. All these information were found out from Lahiri Mahasayas diary lat=
er on. 
=C2=A0
Infact there was a small anecdote regarding Bhaskaranandaji =
and Lahiri Mahasaya. There was a person who was a disciple of Bhaskarananda=
ji, who also used to visit Lahiri Mahasaya. Bhaskarananadaji had heard of L=
ahiri Mahasaya and wanted to meet him. So he asked his disple of invite Lah=
iri Mahasaya. During those days Lahiri Mahasay rarely used to leave his hom=
e. Almost 24 hrs he used to be seated in his room and people used to visit =
him for discussions etc. On hearing the request of the disciple that Bhaska=
ranandaji had wanted to meet Lahiri Mahasaya, Lahiri Mahasaya kept silent f=
or a moment and then said, when a person is thirsty he must come to the wel=
l and not the other way. Later on Lahiri Mahasaya used to speak very highly=
 of Bhaskaranandaji and his level of spirituality.
=C2=A0
I guess this is a=
nother example of how lineages get interconnected, as our Narasimhaji was s=
aying in a previous mail.
=C2=A0
-Regards

Dear members,

Th=
is is the Chandi Sapthasati Rahasya which was expounded by a
great Dattatre=
ya Upasaka. The turiya asrama name of this upasaka is
Shri Bhaskarananda Sa=
raswati who happens to be the devi upasaka in
the lineage of Shri Vasudevan=
anda Saraswati (Tembe Maharaj). There
is no whereabouts of this great upasa=
ka but I got some of the
wonderful manuscripts related to Chandi Sapthasati=
 Rahasya and Yoga
Gayatri Upasana, its process of meditation and the proces=
s of Shat
Chakra Bhedana.

Though the presentation of entire contents of th=
e manuscripts is
not possible for me as the manuscripts runs into 150 pages=
, here is
an attempt of mine to highlight some of the important points whic=
h
may be useful to the upasakas. However, this should be learnt from
sadgur=
u hailing from sat-sampradaya.

The 3 charitas of sapthasati are the symbol=
ic representation of 3
knots or grandhis namely brahma grandhi, Vishnu gran=
dhi and rudra
grandhi. The chit-AbhAsa (false identification of the sthula,=

sukshma and karana dehas to be =EF=BF=BD?oone=EF=BF=BD?Ts own self=EF=BF=
=BD?=EF=BF=BD). This
=EF=BF=BD?~chidAbhAsa=EF=BF=BD ?=EF=BF=BD is of 3 type=
s: karmaja, sahaja and bhramaja.

Brahma grandhi is the identification of o=
neself with sthula deha
(sthula deha abhimana). The sthula and sukshma deha=
 tAdAtmyata
(false identification of oneself with gross and subtle body). T=
his is
Karmaja Chidabhasa. The annihilation of pUrvajanma vAsanAs in the
fo=
rm of =EF=BF=BD?oMala=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD or =EF=BF=BD?odirt=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=
=BD is Brahma Grandhi Bhedana.

Vishnu Grandhi is the identification of one=
self with sukshma deha
(sukshma deha abhimana). AntahkaraNa- chidAbhAsa- ta=
dAtmyata is the
Sahaja ChidAbhAsa. Annihilation of manO-vikshEpa is the Vis=
hnu
Grandhi Bhedana.

Rudra Grandhi is the identification of oneself with K=
arana deha
(chidAbhAsa adhishTAna chaitanya tAdAtmyata). This is Bhramaja
C=
hidabhasa. The dawn of sva-svarupa jnana when the avarana dosha
(veil of ig=
norance in the form of Avidya) is removed is the Rudra
Grandhi Bhedana.

So=
, Brahma-Vishnu- Rudra Grandhis are the 3 episodes or charitas of
Chandi Sa=
pthasati. The sumedha rishi of Sapthasathi is the Rishi
Haritayana who was =
initiated into Srividya by Shri Parashurama.
Parashurama inturn was initiat=
ed by Sage Dattatreya.

Shri Bhaskarananda Saraswathi explaining the inner =
significance of
Sapthsati says that =EF=BF=BD?osavarni=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD i=
s the surya sakti,
=EF=BF=BD?osvArochisha=EF=BF=BD ?=EF=BF=BD is the svarga=
-sambandha- jyoti,
=EF=BF=BD?ochaitravamshasamu dbhavah=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD =
is the being born and re-born as
different species (chitra vichitra janma),=
 =EF=BF=BD?okshitimandala=EF=BF=BD ?=EF=BF=BD is the
gross physical body or=
 sarira, =EF=BF=BD?osuratha=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD is the jiva who is
intereste=
d in 3rd purusharta ie., kama and =EF=BF=BD?oSamadhi=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD is =
the jiva
who is interested in 4th purushartha ie., moksha.

Vishnu-karna- m=
ala is the =EF=BF=BD?omala=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD or =EF=BF=BD?odirt=EF=BF=BD?=
=EF=BF=BD or =EF=BF=BD?ocovering=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD
around the chidAkasa (V=
ishnu-karna) . During the dissolution, Vishnu
is one with Yogamaya and henc=
e Chit swarupa. Karna is the sruti
(ear) whose tanmatra is sound. So, Madhu=
 and Kaitabha are the Mala /
Dirt that covers the Nirmala Chidakasa. Madhu =
is the Ananda Lakshana
and Kaitabha is the =EF=BF=BD?omyriad of insects=EF=
=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD in the form of Sanchita
Karma. The Brahma which is symboli=
c representation of Manas (Mind)
praises the Mahamaya to annihilate the Mad=
hu-Kaitabha in the form of
Sanchita Karma. Waking up of Vishnu is the MahAp=
rANa in Action.

So, annihilitation of Madhu-Kaitabha is the removal of Kar=
majata-
tadAtmyata in the form of brahmagrandhi bhedana (Vasana Kshaya).

T=
he Madhyama Charita indicates the Vishnu Grandhi Bhedana which is
of the fo=
rm of Sahaja Chidabhasa. Mahishasura represents Rajo Guna
in the form of Kr=
odha (anger).

Shri Bhaskarananda Saraswati also describes a =EF=BF=BD?oSec=
ret Upanishad
Vidya=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD which is embedded in Madhyama Charit=
a. This is called
=EF=BF=BD?oJyotishmati Vidya=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD. The Nada=
 which the Devi makes is the
Anahata Dhwani and the Simha (lion) vahana is =
the Himsa dharma which
the sadhaka has to adopt during the upasana. The Jiv=
a with Himsa
Bhava should annihilate his Jiva-bhava. The vyashti prana of t=
he
Jiva dissolves in Samasti Prana. When this is achieved, the Sukshma-
deh=
a abhimana drops off. This is Vishnu Grandhi Bhedana. This is
the victory o=
ver sahaja-chidAbhAsa.

Though among the 5 kosas, the Jiva has penetrated t=
ill Vijnana-maya
Kosa, he still faces the lack of BrahmAnubhUti which is on=
ly through
AparOksha Jnana. With the dawn of Aparoksha Jnana, the last knot=
 is
removed which is Rudra Grandhi. With the removal of veil of
ignorance, =
the avarana drops in the form of Bhramaja ChidAbhAsa.

Chanda denotes mUlAv=
idya; munda denotes tUlAvidya; dhUmralOchana
denotes bhrAnti, raktabIja den=
otes bhOga lAlasa (bhOga vAncha);
shumbha denotes ahamkara; nishumbha denot=
es mamakara. The 8 armies of
shumbha-nishumbha denotes:
ghriNa, lajja, bhay=
a, shanka, jugupsa, kula, shIla, jAti. These 8
tendencies are 8 pAsAs (asht=
a-pAsa) . To remove these 8 pasas, the 8
vidya murtis come forth in the for=
m of Brahmi, =EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD..etc.

Shri Bhaskarananda Saraswati explai=
ns wonderfully the Chandi
Navakshari Mantra taking the pramana from Damara =
Tantra and Shri
Bhaskara. Chamunda is the destroyer of Mula Avidya and Tula=
 Avidya.

There are 3 devatas in Urdhwa Amnaya. They are Viccheswari,
Hamse=
shwari, Samvartheshwari. Vicche is the address to this Urdhwa
Amnaya Devata=
 =EF=BF=BD?oViccheshwari=EF=BF=BD ?=EF=BF=BD which is the =EF=BF=BD?overy a=
uspicious
deity=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD and =EF=BF=BD?oever intent in giving lib=
eration out of
compassion=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD. This is the =EF=BF=BD?ochitka=
la rupa parama Ardra dEvta=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD
which bestows the =EF=BF=BD?o=
pralaya jnana=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD to the upasaka. Moreover,
=EF=BF=BD?ovicch=
e=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD is vit+cha+I which implies =EF=BF=BD?ochit=EF=BF=BD?=
=EF=BF=BD, =EF=BF=BD?osat=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD and
Ananda rupa of the Chamund=
a which is tri-shati rupini as Mahakali
(aim), Mahalakshi (hrim) and Mahasa=
raswati (klim). To such Chamunda
who destroys the Mula Avidya and Tula Avid=
ya, I bow.

This is the Chandi Sapthasati Rahasya given by Paramahamsa
Pari=
vrajakacharya Bhaskarananda Saraswathi who hails from Datta
Sampradaya.
