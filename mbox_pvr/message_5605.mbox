      Namaste,

 

The traditions of worshipping gu=
ru and not worshipping guru are both present. Both are justified for differ=
ent reasons.

 

Before we answer this question, we need to understand who =
is guru.

 

As I said earlier, guru literally means dispeller of darkness,=
 as per Guru Gita.

 

However, there are different levels of darkness ever=
ywhere. When several lights are placed in a room, you may see several shado=
ws that are at varying levels of darkness.

 

Similarly, different concept=
s of goodness in the field of duality exist (like lights in a room). Their =
lack shows different kinds of darkness. A mathematics teacher throws one ki=
nd of light from one angle and removes some level of darkness. A Sanskrit t=
eacher throws one kind of light from one angle and removes some level of da=
rkness. A scholar teaching scriptures throws one kind of light and removes =
some level of darkness. But, none may remove darkness *completely*. Thus, m=
ost teachers are darkness reducers and not darkness dispellers.

 

As long=
 as the delusion of individualized self-awareness (aka "egosense" or ahamka=
ra or asmita) persists and, through it, one experiences dualities such as l=
ikes and dislikes, pleasures and pains etc, one is in *some* level of darkn=
ess! Only a self-realized and liberated person is free from darkness, as th=
e light of Self is the only light that illuminates every point of the unive=
rse, whereas beacons of light in the field of duality light up some parts o=
f and keep some parts of dark. Any person who improves our understanding of=
 things through his teaching is *reducing* darkness, but not *dispelling* i=
t completely. For this reason, most spiritual gurus of today are not really=
 gurus in the correct sense of the word. They are darkness reducers but not=
 darkness dispellers.

 

After all, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa vehemently pro=
tested whenever someone called him a guru and declared firmly that only Par=
abrahma (supreme being) could be called a guru and nobody else was qualifie=
d to be called a guru. This from a man who sent a highly rational being (yo=
ung Narendranath) into samadhi by merely touching him!

 

If one accepts R=
amakrishna's word, then Parabrahma is the only qualified guru. ParaBrahma i=
s worshippable. So guru is worshippable!

 

If you accept someone as guru =
knowing that he is a limited being, then you hope to reach ParaBrahma throu=
gh that person. One approach is to start seeing that person as ParaBrahma (=
that is why we say "gurur brahmaa gurur viShnuH gurur devo maheshwaraH"). I=
f you really see guru as ParaBrahma, then there is meaning in worshipping g=
uru. But, if you do not and you merely see guru as a limited being and an i=
nstrument in reaching ParaBrahma, then any worship is just a ritual and doe=
s not mean much. So Swami Rama's words are not wrong.

 

In the end, wheth=
er you worship guru or not is not the real thing that decides your progress=
. After all, there are those who ban any idol worship, while there are thos=
e who realize God through idols! Whatever practices you follow, the goal is=
 to read union with the divine. One may be worshipping guru with a still an=
d firm mind that views guru as the epitome of divinity and one may progress=
. One may be worshipping guru with a wavering mind that is fluctuating betw=
een the polarities and confusions and one may not make progress. One may no=
t be worshipping guru and yet one's mind may be still and firm and see divi=
nity in all things, those that are worshipped and those that are looked dow=
n upon, and one may make progress. I never emphasize specific actions or sp=
ecific rituals, because that depends on the vaasanaas of the sadhaka.

 

B=
TW, communion with the divine is not an external pursuit, i.e. you do not g=
o somewhere or accumulate something or take some action to experience union=
 with the divine. Jagat or universe is the moving one (literally). ParaBrah=
ma is "experienced" when all movement ceases. All actions and rituals actua=
lly involve movement of consciousness! Ironically, we use well-designed mov=
ements of consciousness to facilitate stillness of consciousness oneday. Th=
is is the irony of spiritual sadhana!

 

My guru never asked me to worship=
 him. He in fact declared to me that he is incapable of doing anything and =
Devi does whatever I may feel that he is doing. He only emphasized the need=
 to experience oneness with the divine and did not tell me to worship him.

Narasimha
