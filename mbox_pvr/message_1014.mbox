Namaste friends,
 
There are plenty of yahoogroups for discussing Vedic astrology (e.g. vedic-astrology, sohamsa, JyotishGroup etc). The vedic-wisdom yahoogroup is for discussions on spirituality only and not for horoscope readings.
 
Please do not post any requests for horoscope readings here.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
