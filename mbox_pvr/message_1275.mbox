Namaste,
 
> Kunjika Shotram is a very powerful one, why do homan of it
 
T=
hat is not a valid reason. Even a very powerful mantra can be offered in ho=
mam. On the Vedic side, Rudra namakam and Gayatri mantra are very very powe=
rful mantras and they are offered in homam. On the Tantrik side, Pratyangir=
a mantra, Mahasudarsana mantra, Paashupata mantra etc are very very powerfu=
l astra mantras and they are offered in homam. As these examples show, even=
 very powerful mantras can be offered in fire for amplification.
 
*       =
 *        *
 
The power of powerful mantras is a mirage for most people. Th=
e experience given by a mantra and the internal/external results brought by=
 a mantra vary from mantra to mantra. But, even with a very powerful mantra=
, one needs to be ready for the mantra to actually work.
 
When one is able=
 to perfectly control the mind and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thought=
s but the mantra reverberating in the mind constantly), then one experience=
s the mantra. This perfect absorption of self-awareness in the mantra then =
causes internal changes by the flow of energy internally in specific ways (=
specific to the mantra) and that causes corresponding external changes in t=
he universe and corresponding karmic interactions between various objects. =

 
There may be thousands of paths to climb a mountain. Each path takes one=
 to a different spot atop the mountain. The view one has from the top may b=
e different accordingly. One view may be more breathtaking and amazing than=
 another. However, one taking a path leading to a breathtaking view and one=
 taking a path leading to a normal view both have to struggle on their path=
s and reach the top despite obstacles. Some paths may be slightly shorter, =
but none is too easy. All paths are difficult to walk, but some result in a=
 more breathtaking view than the others.
 
Similarly, one chanting a "power=
ful mantra" and a "normal mantra" will both have to put in effort and overc=
ome the weaknesses and get control over mind. The power of the powerful man=
tra refers to a more powerful experience after one succeeds with the mantra=
 (more breathtaking scenery on reaching the mountain top). It is not correc=
t to think that things will happen automatically and easily because one if =
chanting a powerful mantra 11 (or whatever) times.
 
*        *        *
 
=
Coming back to Rajarshi's question, I do not recommend homam with Kunjika s=
totra. Kunjika stotra is a coded stotra containing several mantras in coded=
 form. It is not what it may seem to be. It is for a reason that Shiva tell=
s Parvati that this prayer should be hidden like one's privates. It is weir=
d that we are discussing such a secretive mantra on a public forum. It is a=
 collection of powerful mantras for specific prayogas that would be conside=
red raajasik/taamasik unless a realized soul without attachment to the acti=
ons is acting them out as an instrument of the Divine.
 
I see no point in =
wanting to do homam with it. If you are meant to do a homam with Kunjika st=
otra to stop the army of a country in their tracks or kill someone or delud=
e someone etc and if you are detached enough to carry it off successfully, =
then you will be given an opportunity by nature to learn it and do it. Othe=
rwise, why even try?
 
My advice is to drop the idea of doing a homam with =
Kunjika stotra. Just stick to saptashati (700 verses). If that is too long =
for you, try saptashloki (7 verses) or just the 4th chapter or just the 11t=
h chapter. Another option is to do a homam with just the moola mantra (nava=
akshari).
 
If one can pronounce the 8 verses of Devi sooktam well, a homam=
 with Devi sooktam is a great idea too.
 
*        *        *
 
A few mails=
 from the last couple of weeks are pending reply. I am aware of it and will=
 try to catch up. I am very busy with various things right now. Please do n=
ot resend the mails. If I have something to say, I will send a reply in the=
 next 10 days.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
