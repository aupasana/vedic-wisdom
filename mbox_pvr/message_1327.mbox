Namaste Ashwin ji,
 
My guru's idea is to start four such centers in east, =
west, north and south parts of India and then establish one in Ujjain.
 
Th=
e idea with each center is as following: It should be in some peaceful and =
calm place that is easily accessible by modern transportation and yet a lit=
tle away from the hustle and bustle of modern life. There need not be a big=
 or famous temple nearby. Buy a few acres of land (for possible expansion i=
n future) and construct a homa kundam built in open space with four pillars=
 on the four sides and a high roof on the top to protect from rain. The are=
a is open on all the four sides and covered only on the top. Close to it, a=
 small one or two room structure is built to store materials.
 
A priest or=
 a sadhaka is employed. His main qualification is that he should be a since=
re devotee of the Mother and interested in a simple lifestyle dedicated to =
Her. His job is to do one Chandi homam in the morning, one more in forenoon=
, have lunch, relax in the afternoon and do one more Chandi homam in the ev=
ening. Keep doing it day in and day out. There are no idols to worship and =
no other rituals to do.
 
This will pretty much take up all his time and he=
nce enough money should be arranged to take care of the priest and his fami=
ly. If the priest is not well-versed in homam or Chandi homam, that is no p=
roblem. He can be trained. But, the most important thing is that he should =
be committed to this and devoted to the Mother. If one has the basic simpli=
city, innocence, devotion and purity, other things will fall in place by th=
emselves.
 
Buying of the land and construction of room and homa kundam (wi=
th roof and pillars) is a one-time expense. Salary of the priest and materi=
als like ghee, wood etc for homam are an ongoing expense. This project requ=
ires a good amount of money and energy.
 
*        *        *
 
After a cen=
ter is established and sadhana progresses in each center, slowly the presen=
ce of Mother will be established there. Once that happens, the sadhaka will=
 start making faster progress. As he becomes purer and purere, the sadhana =
will generate more and more energy.
 
After establishing 4 other centers, a=
 center in Ujjain is to be started. The sadhana being done at the Chandi ho=
mam centers will have a catalytic influence on the homam movement and many =
many people will start doing different kinds of homas around the world. Thi=
s will have a major impact on dharma in the world. That is what he was told=
.
 
*        *        *
 
I did not want to force or impose on anybody. So =
this has waited. When the time comes, people who will make this happen will=
 come and take charge.
 
Time has probably not yet come for Ujjain. But if =
there is a village in Gujarat or Maharashtra where you can do this, please =
consider. But please realize that this requires money commitment and also a=
 committed sadhaka.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

       Namaste,

          The only specific name mentioned was Ujjain. Oth=
ers were not mentioned specifically.

          As I said, these things req=
uire resources. But if the Mother really wants, it will happen. She told to=
 teach simple homam procedures and we were gifted several books on homam by=
 that temple priest on the very next day, without even asking. Just as She =
said, everything has been nicely arranged so far. Regarding these centres o=
f Chandi homam also, I am confident that She will show the direction when t=
ime comes. Until then, I will keep doing my individual sadhana, teach vario=
us homam procedures and answer queries from interested sadhakas to the best=
 of my ability. What needs to happen will happen when the time comes.

  No, we have not yet acted on that instruction. I am pleased that some oth=

                              Namaste friends=
,

                              Shree Maa was referred to here. Someone se=
nt me a few snippets from an 
                              interview poste=
d on her website. Please see below.

                              It is in=
teresting that she considers Ramakrishna Paramahamsa as her guru. It 
     =
                         is interesting that Ramakrishna told her she had t=
o "do fire ceremonies and 
                              show what is truth=
" and "at that time the whole world will be peace". This 
                 =
             is similar to what my guru was told by Divine Mother when she =
appeared to 
                              him during Shata Chandi homam at=
 Chennai.

                              She told him that many people are =
and will be born who will perform a short 
                              fi=
re ritual on a regular basis, establish sanatana dharma and peace in the 
 =
                             world and also make quick spiritual progress i=
ndividually in that process. 
                              Shree Maa's sta=
tement about what Ramakrishna told her is along similar 
                  =
            lines.

                              My guru was also told by =
Mother that a few centres of regular Chandi homam 
                        =
      should be established around the world, where Chandi homam is done 3 =
times a 
                              day. These places do not need to be =
near any temples or famous places and 
                              can be=
 anywhere. The ritual need not be elaborate. For example, there is no 
    =
                          need to offer silk sarees etc in fire. A simple r=
itual with bare minimum 
                              offerings is enough,=
 but it needs to be performed 3 times everyday. When a 
                   =
           few such centres are established, it will apparently lead to a c=
hain of 
                              events that will help re-establish s=
anatana dharma.

                              Though not 3 times a day, th=
ese people have done a Chandi homam everyday for 
                         =
     3 years in the same place and finished 1000 such homas. That is fantas=
tic! 
                              It is the sadhana and purity of sadhaka=
s that creates energy and brings 
                              deities to =
a place. While several ancient temples are without any divine 
            =
                  presence these days, new places of divine presence may be=
 created by pure 
                              souls engaged in selfless s=
adhana for establishing dharma in the world.

                             =
 As I mentioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Shata Chandi homam during whic=
h 
                              Mother appeared and gave instructions to m=
y guru on spreading homam was 
                              taken on Ramak=
rishna' s birth anniversary and the time of sankalpa was within 
          =
                    a few minutes from the actual Tithi Pravesha time of th=
e birth anniversary. 
                              All of this was a coinc=
idence and we were unaware of this significance when 
                     =
         we decided the muhurta. It is interesting to know that Ramakrishna=
 did 
                              mention fire ceremonies specifically to=
 somebody and that his words are 
                              similar to =
the words of Mother.

There need not be a big or=
 famous temple nearby. Buy a few acres of land (for 
possible expansion in =

with four pillars =
on the four sides and a high roof on the top to protect from 
rain. The are=
