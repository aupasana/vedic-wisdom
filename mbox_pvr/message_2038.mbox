Namaste Jeff,

Welcome to the group!

It is interesting that each one of us=
 comes with a different world view
based on all the literature and thinking=
 one has been exposed to and the
life experiences. It seems to me like you =
have a unique background.

Though I always insist that direct experience is=
 far more important than
theoretical discussions, it is useful to discuss s=
ometimes.

My background is mainly in vedanta and sanatana dharma and not i=
n
Buddhism. I will comment on your post based on MY understanding of what
y=
our background is and what you are saying. Your mail is quite loaded
and I =
will respond only to some salient points in a freewheeling manner.

*      =
  *        *

My world view is slightly different. Aatman is that which is =
in ALL
beings and things as the non-dual and permanent reality. But we do n=
ot
perceive Aatman and perceive only the objects of the dual world, which
a=
re impermanent. However, the impermanent objects of this dual world too
are=
 made of Aatman and non-different from Aatman. They do not consist of
"anaa=
tman" (non-aatman), but aatman only. Let me give an analogy.

A ripple in t=
he pond is also part of pond and not non-pond. While the
pond is stationary=
 and permanent, the ripple is moving and transient. It
will vanish after a =
while and merge in the stationary pond. Some ripples
die away too fast and =
some take a very long time. Some transform from
one structure to another be=
fore they vanish. But each ripple vanishes
eventually and the pond remains =
in the place where there was a ripple
once. As a matter of fact, even when =
the ripple existed, one can still
view it as the pond and not as a ripple.
=

Aatman or Brahman described by Veda and Upanishad is like the pond. All
be=
ings of the dual world that are perceivable to us are like the ripples
in t=
he pond. They arise, they move, they get transformed into different
shapes,=
 they interact with each other and get disturbed by each other
and eventual=
ly they slow down and vanish.

*        *        *

Thus, we do not talk in=
 terms of aatman and anaatman (non-aatman). We
consider everything as aatma=
n. However, some parts of imperishable
aatman seem perishable because of ou=
r way of looking, when our
perspective is limited by duality.

The preserva=
tional and destructive aspects are both part of duality and
non-dual aatman=
 is free from all such considerations. Nothing is created
or preserved or d=
estroyed in aatman. But, when one looks from a
perspective that is limited =
by duality, it seems like there are objects
being created, preserved and de=
stroyed.

*        *        *

One gets liberation or moksha when one's per=
spective is not limited by
the duality. Even when stuck in a ripple that fe=
els like a violent
whirlpool, if one can think "I am the pond" and act like=
 it, then one is
liberated. If a ripple is going to come hit the ripple one=
 is in and
disturb one's stability, if one can still think "I am the pond" =
and act
like it, then one is liberated. Of course, I am talking in terms of=
 the
analogy I introduced earlier.

When one is not liberated and one's per=
spective is clouded by duality,
one experiences happiness, sadness, love, l=
ust, hatred, anger, jealosy
etc and various emotions. When one is liberated=
 and one's perspective is
not limited by duality, one is filled with great =
bliss. This was the
goal of Buddha as well as Vedic rishis.

*        *    =
    *

Though rishis declared that everything is Aatman and inability to
re=
cognize it is due to one's perspective being limited by duality, they
did n=
ot leave it at that. They did not say "this duality is nonsense or
delusion=
 or magic or anaatman. Just get over it", because getting over
it is not ea=
sy. For one stuck in a whirlpool in a pond and panicking,
the mere preachin=
g "ignore the whirlpool and think of the pond" is
useless.

They prescribed=
 various paths that are appropriate for people of various
backgrounds to sl=
owly get over duality. In fact, for people who do not
want to get over dual=
ity and want to remain in it, manipulate it to
their [temporary] advantage =
and enjoy it also, they prescribed various
paths.

The respect rishis showe=
d to both non-dual Aatman AND the field of
duality is perhaps unique to san=
atana dharma and perhaps missing in
Buddhism.

*        *        *

Aghora =
is not meant to be a path of addition to sex or drugs or pain. It
is the pa=
th of seeing Aatman even in depraving conditions. If an
aghori's focus of m=
ind wavers from the chosen deity and becomes aware of
the body or its sense=
 inputs, then he has failed badly. Only a sadhaka
with a very high level of=
 purity already is capable of testing
himself/herself in depraving conditio=
ns and see if they disturb the
mental focus on god. As Svoboda correctly po=
ints out at the beginning of
his book on Aghora, the sadhakas who are pure =
enough to succeed in
Aghora practices usually are not attracted to Aghora a=
nd those who find
the practices attractive are usually not pure enough to s=
ucceed in them.

However, we cannot equate goddess worship to aghora. Aghor=
a is a set of
extreme practices. Goddess worship has a wide range of practi=
ces in
India. Some worship the goddess without any "self-destruction" or ev=
en
self-deprivation and pursue rank materialism along with goddess worship.=

Some worship goddess with varying levels of self-deprivation aimed at
slow=
ly limiting the influence of sense inputs and considerations of
sense pleas=
ures/pains on the ability of the mind to focus on the Divine.
Sanatana dhar=
ma has a wide variety of practices that are appropriate for
people of vario=
us level of spiritual evolution and various degrees of
internal purity.

* =
       *        *

But, given the wide variety of teachings and practices a=
vailable, people
sometimes lap up the wrong teachings for them. For example=
, one person
may claim "I am Brahman, I am imperishable aatman, I am Buddha=
 and I
have to do no sadhana". A pretension or a mere academic statement is=
 not
a substitute for an internal *realization*. If a terrible strife
befal=
ls, like a slow and painful death or a debilitating disease or
terrible inj=
ury, one may start saying "I am in great pain". Well, if one
is Brahman, th=
ere is no pain or pleasure.

One should realize that teachings relating to =
non-duality are
inapplicable to most people and they need to do some sadhan=
a to wade the
field duality and reach non-duality. In this light, we must a=
ppreciate
the respectful treatment of duality by rishis (who themselves had=

overcome it completely) and their teaching of many tools to slowly wade
it=
.

Best regards,
Narasimha
