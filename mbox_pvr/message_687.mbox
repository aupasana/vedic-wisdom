Thank you once again! Your mails are an inspiration. I r=
emember when I first started praying to Bhairav Baba and also started attem=
pting Homa last year, I used to pray to him to guide me in homa, to teach m=
e how to do it better. And then I came across your homa manuals, this commu=
nity and your mails.. Its like Bhairav Baba granted my request. 
=C2=A0
Tha=
nk you a LOT Narasimhaji for your effort, your time and the good work that =
you are doing.
=C2=A0
-Regards

Namaste,
=C2=A0
A=
s I said earlier to you, do not worry about mistakes committed due to lack =
of knowledge. Once you get knowledge, try to put it to use and correct prev=
ious mistakes if that is possible. A detached yogi engages in a lot of acti=
ons, but does not waste even a second feeling good/proud/happy about a good=
 thing from the past or feeling bad/ashamed/ sad about a bad thing from the=
 past. Doing homam in an iron homa kunda is better than not doing homa at a=
ll.
=C2=A0
In general, please remember that iron is not good for homa kunda=
, kalasha (vessel/pot) used to invoke deities in a regular pooja or idol us=
ed in regular pooja.
=C2=A0
As you are a saadhaka of Bhairava, please reali=
ze that Kaala Bhairava is extremely tolerant of protocol violations/mistake=
s and highly intolerant of attitude mistakes. Have a strong sense of detach=
ment and devotion.
=C2=A0
Apart from Kashi, one may consider doing Kaala Bh=
airava sadhana at Ujjain to get the blessings of Kaala Bhairava faster.

N=
amaste,

It is a bad idea to use an iron homa kundam. If there is any chanc=
e to avoid 
iron and use a better metal such as copper, that should be done=
.

Iron homa kundam may be used only in circumstances where there is no cho=
ice 
and the only alternative is to not do a homam at all.

Those who live =
in India and have a big yard can actually dig a homa kundam 
(2 ft length x=
 2 ft width x 1ft deep or 1 ft x 1 ft x 0.5 ft deep) and do in 
it also.

I=
ron represented by Saturn is not an auspicious metal.

Best regards,
Narasi=
mha
