Subject: Homam for begetting a child

Namaste,
 
A few people sent me personal mails asking me which homam can be tried for getting a child. Though I advocate doing homam for spiritual progress and not for specific material results, getting a child is a very noble material result to aspire. Thus, I will make some suggestions. I suggest trying one of these without expectations and with surrender. It may work for some people.
 
*        *        *
 
One homam taught in shastras is Santana Gopala Homam. You can use Krishna Homam manual (see the homam manual website below) and use the following mantra for pradhaana homam (in iTrans notation):
 
devakIputra govinda vaasudeva jagatpate |
dehi me tanayaM kR^ShNa tvaamahaM sharaNamgataH || svaahaa |
 
It means: "Son of Devaki, Govinda, Vasudeva's son, O Lord of the universes, please give me a child, O Krishna, I have surrendered to you." If you are a woman, change "sharaNaMgataH" to "sharaNaMgataa".
 
Apart from standard offerings, Tulasi (holy basil) leaves can be offered.
 
*        *        *
 
Though very powerful, the above saattwik mantra by itself may or may not work for most people living in increasingly raajasik and taamasik environments these days. In this age, Chandipath and Vishnu sahasranaama stotra may work faster. I suggest doing samputikarana of one of those two with the above Santana Gopala Mantra.
 
In other words, do Chandi homam with 700 verses of Chandipath or do Vishnu homam with 108 verses of Vishnu sahasranaama stotra by adding the above verse in between all verses. Read the above verse (devakiputra), make an offering, then read verse 1 of what you chose (Chandipath or Vishnu sahasranaama stotra), make an offering, read the above verse again, make an offering, then read verse 2 of what you chose, make an offering, and so on. After reading the final verse (700th or 108th), make an offering, then read the above verse one final time and make an offering. Thus, the number of offerings will be double that of a regular Chandi homam or Vishnu homam (plus one). It will take more time.
 
Doing samputikarana like this with various beejas or mantras works in different ways. Using Santana Gopala Mantra for samputikarana can make it work towards giving a child. I specifically recommend doing Santana Gopala Mantra Samputikarana in Chandi homam or Vishnu homam. With Chandi homam, result *may* follow after a small setback. Vishnu homam may be take more time, but work smoothly. Do the one that you are more comfortable with or more used to.
 
Apart from standard offerings, two offerings were mentioned in the shastras for begetting a child. Krishna jeera (black cumin seeds) was suggested in one place and buds (baby flowers that did not bloom yet) were suggested in another place. If you can get some buds, use them in addition to other standard offerings.
 
*        *        *
 
Like I said, doing homam without ANY expectations is the best. Then god gives whatever is truly best for us. However, when a problem (e.g. childlessness) bugs one, one may do homam with a desire in the mind. But, even as one does homam with a desire, one should realize that one can only do what one can and the result is finally in god's hand. One should surrender to god and do the best job one can.
 
I suggest trying one of the three homas I suggested here everyday. Fire is a living god and our connection to divinity. Spending time with fire purifies our consciousness and burns blocking karmas. It is the best and safest sadhana available to us for spiritual progress and for saattwik material goals.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
