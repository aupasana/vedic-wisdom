Subject: "Intense" Meditation (Re: Mahabharat Timing)

Namaste,

We use terms like "intense meditation" and they may mean differen=
t 
things to different people based on their background and experiences.

R=
anjan is correct - I do define intense meditation as meditation where 
mind=
 is fully (or nearly fully) involved/engaged in the mantra (or the 
deity o=
r the point of focus) and forgets other things. If mind is 
engaged in thou=
sand things and also chants mantra, nothing is going to 
happen. However, t=
hat is what most of us are capable of doing anyway. So 
we start off like t=
hat and keep going, until oneday mind achieves focus. 
Even a few seconds o=
f absolute focus on a mantra will produce far more 
bliss than one may have=
 ever experienced.

If one's mind is feeling intensity/pressure and the tho=
ughts "I must 
focus intensely on this mantra", "why am I unable to focus" =
torment it, 
one can anyway not focus well on the mantra. They will act lik=
e hecklers 
at a performance. Intense meditation is accompanied ironically =
by a lack 
of pressure or frustration or mind becomes light with all though=
ts 
having deserted it.

One who tries to meditate in front of fire after h=
omam will realize that 
fire has the ability to enhance focus, especially w=
hen one views that 
fire with a sense of sacredness. In the end, external t=
ools help only so 
much and internal transformation needs contemplation, se=
lf-analysis and 
self-control over a period of time.

If one tries to use f=
ire (homam) for taamasik goals like hurting 
someone, one can be punished s=
everely if one is not careful. But if one 
surrenders to god and seeks to m=
ake spiritual progress while also taking 
good care of one's dharma in the =
material world, there is no risk. Fire 
is then like a kind and caring guru=
 or parent who teaches you and 
transforms you, at the pace you are capable=
 of of course.

Best regards,
Narasimha
