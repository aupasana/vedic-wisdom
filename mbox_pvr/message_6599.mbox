Respected Sirs,
I have been reading interesting discussion on sanyas these =
days. The explanations given by Shri Narsimha guruji are simply superb, cle=
aring every doubt. In this regard I would add a thought mentioned in Gajana=
n Vijay by sant Dasganu maharaj.
There are four ways to supreme knowledge- =
karma, bhakti, sanyas and yoga. All the paths reach the same destination. T=
he follower of each path gets the same benifit. Only those who are walking =
on the different paths often quarrel saying his path is best, not knowing a=
ll paths lead to the same place.
Doing the work as service to God or playin=
g my role as directed by the director(God) to the best of my ability withou=
t critising the other actors will help me to do my role The Best.
I believe=
, it is He who is getting Homam done at my hands, I obey His wish. He selec=
ts a path which is good for His child.
As I have read Mataji ( wife of Ramk=
rishna paramhansa) said " mother cooks the potato in different ways to the =
taste and ability to digest for her children".
Once again my respects to al=
l the learned members who have been putting their views and making the disc=
ussion interesting.
madhusudan.

Namaste,
=C2=A0
> Real sanyasa is a condition of the mi=
nd.
=C2=A0
The real pooja to be done is to the god inside us. However, we d=
o worship god in idols, fire and other things. Similarly, though real sanny=
asa is a condition of the mind, we may use external renunciation to bring a=
bout that "condition of the mind" slowly. Sannyasa is a valid path to brahm=
a jnaana (self-knowledge).
=C2=A0
As said below, there is a context for eve=
ry statement.
=C2=A0
As Chandra Prakash's references in his last 2 mails sh=
ow, Swami Sivananda's views are sublime, though some specific quotes in thi=
s series are quite shallow. Someone said these statements may have come fro=
m deep bhava and vairagya. I do not think so. Statements made in this serie=
s do not reveal anything sublime or any higher mood. My guess is that he si=
mply targeted a specific group of people and these were the right words in =
his view to inspire their spiritual journey. But, if one takes them as insp=
ired words in general giving insights on sannyasa or karma or self-realizat=
ion, one will be misguided.
=C2=A0
If I am keen on a group of people doing =
homam and progressing spiritually, I may tell them "without using external =
fire in sadhana, one cannot find god" and give various quotes about the imp=
ortance of fire. But, I'd hope such words with a narrow purpose don't live =
on for too long or reach too many people to create confusion.

Detachment/dispassion to material world and actions is g=
ood, but disgust for them is not. Disgust for anything is a kind of attachm=
ent. Attraction and disgust are different kinds of attachments and both are=
 bad. This series was promoting disgust for actions and disgust for materia=
l world.
=C2=A0
Of course, attraction to some things (e.g. a siddhi or a ma=
terial result) or disgust for something (e.g. a wife who harasses one, mate=
rial life that does not allow much time for meditation) can motivate someon=
e to start sadhana. But, teachings that play on attraction/disgust to inspi=
re sadhana should be taken with a pinch of salt and in the right perspectiv=
e.

=C2=A0
Someone said I was talking about "hands i=
n society" and Sivananda about "heads in forest". But, everyone has head an=
d hands and needs to use them both. It is a misconception to think that tho=
se who choose to use head don't need hands or vice versa. Whether one is a =
hand-strong person or head-strong person, one needs to use both. One relyin=
g mostly on head cannot cut off hands and vice versa.
=C2=A0
The bifurcatio=
n of karma and jnaana into 2 opposing paths is a huuuuuge misconception. As=
 I said, Vasishtha is clear that action and knowledge are the two wings of =
the bird of self!

=C2=A0
As long as there is indivi=
dual ego and we perceive duality, we have a two-way relationship with the u=
niverse. We give (things, experiences etc) to others and we take (things, e=
xperiences etc) from others.
=C2=A0
You can renounce the portion that you *=
take*, i.e. you do not expect to get anything from anybody, you do not acti=
vely pursue to get anything from anybody and accept whatever you get. But, =
what you owe and what you need to *give* to others, you HAVE to give someho=
w or the other. Sannyasa is not an escape from the existing debts. It is a =
vow/attempt to not get into additional debts.
=C2=A0
Give freely and magnan=
imously, like Sun. When it comes to taking, do not expect anything and take=
 whatever comes by itself. Whenever something upsets you, see if expectatio=
n of getting something from someone is at the root of it. If so, remove tha=
t thought. Detachment will slowly develop.

Narasimha

In one of the brahmacharya classes, =

<DIV>I have been r=
eading interesting discussion on sanyas these days. The explanations given =
by Shri Narsimha guruji are simply superb, clearing every doubt. In this re=
gard I would add a thought mentioned in Gajanan Vijay by sant Dasganu mahar=
aj.</DIV>
<DIV>There are four ways to supreme knowledge- karma, bhakti, san=
yas and yoga. All the paths reach the same destination. The follower of eac=
h path gets the same benifit. Only those who are walking on the different p=
aths often quarrel saying his path is best, not knowing all paths lead to t=
he same place.</DIV>
<DIV>Doing the work as service to God or playing my ro=
le as directed by the director(God) to the best of my ability without criti=
sing the other actors will help me to do my role The Best.</DIV>
<DIV>I bel=
ieve, it is He who is getting Homam done at my hands, I obey His wish. He s=
elects a path which is good for His child.</DIV>
<DIV>As I have read Mataji=
 ( wife of Ramkrishna paramhansa) said " mother cooks the potato in differe=
nt ways to the taste and ability to digest for her children".</DIV>
<DIV>On=
ce again my respects to all the learned members who have been putting their=
 views and making the discussion interesting.</DIV>
