Namaste friends,
 
This is the 7th day of pitri paksha and there are 8 more=
 days. Krishna paksha (waning fortnight) of lunar month Bhadrapada is calle=
d pitri paksha. This fortinight coming just before the nava ratris is consi=
dered a great time to perform pitri tarpanas. Those who are interested in p=
itri tarpanas can download a manual from the website below and perform it. =
It is a very simple procedure and can be finished in 5-45 min, depending on=
 whether one does super-short or short or regular procedure and how comfort=
able with Sanskrita.
 
*        *        *
 
Most of us know about god and =
about what is good to do and what is bad. Still we end up doing, thinking a=
nd wanting wrong things on a constant basis. The reason is that we cannot c=
ontrol our mind. The root cause of it is that mind is conditioned by variou=
s tendencies accumulated over various karmas. It is very difficult to overc=
ome these tendencies.
 
Tarpana washes away tendencies that one got via kar=
mik debt from ancestors (and others who one has a debt to) in various lives=
. Homam burns away tendencies that one got because of various actions commi=
tted by one in various lives. The mixture of one's own actions in the past =
and the debts to various beings in the past creates the set of tendencies t=
hat condition one's mind currently. These two sadhanas - homam and tarpana =
- are extremely effective for overcoming inherent tendencies and make spiri=
tual progress. Those who are interested can take advantage of the easy manu=
als that were created for both.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
