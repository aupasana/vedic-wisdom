Dear Narasimha,

Hopefully, this will be my last mail on this topic, since =

baseless. 

=C2=A0
The exa=

an=
d the bird flying back to the mother, before hitting the ground is brillian=
t. 
I too was thinking of the exact=C2=A0same example. Good you mentioned.=
=C2=A0And as I see 
it, this is similar to the analysis I was mentioning ab=
out "amsas" - projections 
of Higher Divine beings. Fits the bill perfectly=
! Yes that is why=C2=A0they were 
Nitya Siddhas. 

=C2=A0
I see Siddhis in =

assessments. Yo=

=C2=A0
Otherwise, as per Vimalananada's, the hirerchy is well defined=
. But=C2=A0what is also 
important is to remember great beings send their a=
msa for specific works, which 
is far more important. So one not needing to=
 achieve a certain state, may not do 
so. 

=C2=A0
To get a better understa=

maybe more spirituall=

Thats your point of view. Mine is different. I don't kno=

If a loved and revered spiritual figure is percieved to be questioned, nat=

They maybe, or they may-not be. Such blanket statements are=
 incorrect and gloss 
over nuances and create a totally wrong picture.=C2=
=A0Infact it also=C2=A0violates a point

Just in case someone got the impression that I do =
not admire Swami Vivekananda 
or his brother disciples, it is totally wrong=
. I respect and revere them highly. 
And Swami Vivekananda was a unique per=

How do you know that Vivekananda, Yogananda etc did not do that (or possibl=

Well, they not only regarded him as "higher th=

Fatness is external and =
judgable. Internal things (e.g. A is happier than B) 
cannot be judged the =

(siddhi=3Dattainment). It is inte=
rnal and not observable externally.

And you believe that you are a=

Your whole p=

factors to judge one's spiritual caliber.
=C2=A0
My two main messages:
=C2=
=A0
(1) One need not pursue siddhis. Siddhis are not a measure of one's spi=
ritual 
progress and neither necessary nor sufficient for liberation.
(2) I=
t is unwise to pass judgments on yogis like Vivekananda. Ramakrishna never =

tolerated anyone speaking anything slightly critical of Vivekananda as he =

regarded Vivekananda as Narayana himself. Why not give him the benefit of =
doubt 
and direct your critical faculty and discrimination at somebody/some=
thing else? 
Not because it is offensive, but because you cannot be sure!

=C2=A0 
Simple! Ramakrishna says Vivekananda was a part of a Rishi who =
came down. An 
amsa is not a Rishi in fullforce, but sufficient part of the=
 Rishi's 
consciousness that comes down for a secific purpose and once the =
purpose is 
served, goes back to the source. Similar for the 6 Nitya-Siddha=
s. Therefore, 
very technically, Swami Vivekananda is an *amsa* of a Rishi,=
 a projection of a 
Rishi. Not the Rishi is full. BTW, all of these Siddhas=
, Naths, Munis etc are 
projection Rishis one way or the other. Each is kep=
t is ingorance of their real 
being (Rishi) such that the play can go on (n=
ot my words, Vimalananda's words). 
They are Nitya-siddha because even if t=
hey take birth over and over, being parts 
of extremely higher beings, thes=
e emanations/projections/amsas will surely 
eventually go back to the sourc=
e when the work is done. 

=C2=A0 
However, in their forms as specific indi=
viduals like Vivekananda, whether these 
amsa attain the specific stages wh=
ich makes a siddha/nath/muni/rishi will 
determine if they are to be called=
 so. They may not need to do so since they are 
here for a purpose. But, th=
e only way a person can be called a siddha in true 
sense is when he, as Vi=
malananda puts it, "picks a petal", (some specific 
shaktis) an "orbit" and=

=C2=A0 
There is a book of conversations between Totapuri and a c=
ertain sadhaka (his 
disciple) when Totapuri lived in Puri. He used to stay=
 in the Swargadwara 
smashana and later someone build a small ashram for hi=
m. Totapuri's ashram still 
exists in Puri. In that conversation, Totapuri =
also mentions a similar ideas of 
what is a siddha and higher. And how only=
 a Siddha and none less is a true 
Vigyani. He further mentions that Swami =
Vivekananda did not (need) to go to the 
stage of a Siddha. His work was sp=
ecific, he did the work and went off. He did 
not need to and therefore did=
 not become a Siddha. I see zero confusion here. 

=C2=A0 
Added to this th=
e fact that Vivekananda was very clear, just as all the 
disciples of Ramak=
rshna were clear, that Ramakrishna was a special spiritual 
being, and high=
er than them. Here too I see no confusion.

Dear Narasimha, 
=C2=A0 
In the discussion that happened, he=
re is my stand, in case you have not 
understood the same properly: 

=C2=
=A0 
1) He was something special - which I cannot judge - because Manish sa=
ys so, and 
on THIS point I trust Manish's judgement more than your or mine=
. 

=C2=A0 
2) Some siddhis as you noted are special. Only very higher leve=
l beings can 
attain the same. Since the topic of siddhis did come up, Vima=
lananda's ability 
to suck up a ton of mercury by Vajroli and bring it out =
from his hair infront of 
someone of Vishudhananda's spiritual calibre, is =
not a easy feat. This is not a 
run-of-the-mill siddhi. 

=C2=A0 
3) I neve=
r compared Vimalananda with Ramakrishna, but with Ramakrishna's 
disciples.=
 That is a crucial difference.=C2=A0 My comparisons are always based NOT on=
 
my understanding, but clear words of great spiritual people. That is why =
I am 
100 perecent clear that Ramakrishna is spiritually higher than a Vive=
kananada or 
an Abhedananda. You may not want to judge them., thats your po=
int of view. I on 
the other hand would rather rely on the clear words of V=
ivekananda and 
Abhedananda on this matter rather than speculation. Both Vi=
vekananda and 
Abhedananda used to say Ramakrishna is their Guru and spirit=
ually far higher 
than they were. 

=C2=A0 
4) Whether Ramakrishna was a pa=
ramhamsa or a siddha in Vimalananda's scale is 
merely your speculation. Vi=
malananda's books however betray no such speculation. 
I would rather rely =
on the words of the book. 

=C2=A0 
5) In this age everyone likes to take a=
 title for himself. Many spiritual people 
name themselves Rishis, and we k=
now it they are not.=C2=A0 So the Nityananda 
comparison does not stand. Vi=
malananda on his part never used any titles, not 
even the term Guru. I bas=
e my judgement of this man on a) critical study of the 
books b) Manish's w=
ords. And I have not found you giving any sound logic for why 
I should cha=
nge the same. 

=C2=A0 
6) If you do not want to compare spiritual people, =
that is perfectly fine. I or 
anyone else is not forcing you. However, that=
 does not mean the world will not 
do so, specially when the great spiritua=
l people themselves have clearly done so 
on different occassions. Vivekana=
nda says Ramakrishna a greater spiritual man. I 
take his words as true. Pe=
riod. 

=C2=A0 
Dear All, 
=C2=A0 
This is hardly a matter of parochialism.=
 Please do not unnecessarily complicate 
a simple discussion. I think the d=

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] On Siddhis & Spiritual Progress=
 

=C2=A0 
Namaste friends, 
=C2=A0 
This is a small writeup on "siddhis" v=
is-a-vis spiritual progress, in reaction 
to further exchanges on Twitter. =
This is a delicate area where many have 
misconceptions and I will try to a=
ddress them. 

=C2=A0 
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * 
=C2=A0 
Maharshi Vasishtha's teachi=
ng to Lord Rama is clear in Yoga Vaasishtham. The 
goal of existence and sa=
dhana is self-realization. Siddhis are to be neither 
specifically sought n=
or specifically avoided, by a seeker of Self. If Nature 
gives one some sid=
dhi(s), one should accept them with neither excitement nor 
disappointment.=
 But one should NOT run after them, for they are neither 
necessary nor suf=
ficient for self-realization and liberation. 

=C2=A0 
Vivekananda used the=
 same principle when Ramakirishna proposed to give his 
siddhis to Vivekana=
nda. He asked whether the siddhis will enable him to realize 
god. Ramakris=
hna said no. Vivekananda firmly declined the offer then! Of course, 
when R=
amakrishna gave them anyway later, he accepted them. Vivekananda's two 
act=
ions demonstrate Vasishtha's instructions well. 

=C2=A0 
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * 
=
=C2=A0 
Let us use the analogy of climbing a hill. Climbing hill is one's s=
piritual 
sadhana. Reaching the top is liberation. Different people climb t=
he hill from 
different sides and using different paths. There may be trees=
 with nice fruits 
on the sides of the road. They are siddhis or special ab=
ilities. 

=C2=A0 
If one gets distracted, starts climbing the trees and co=
llecting fruits, one's 
journey gets delayed and one may not reach the top.=
 That is why Vasishtha says a 
seeker of Self does not pursue any siddhis. =


=C2=A0 
But if some fruits fall in one's lap by themselves, one can keep =
them. 
Similarly, siddhis that come to one by themselves can be accepted by=
 a seeker of 
Self. 

=C2=A0 
Now an important distinction: 
=C2=A0 
There =
are some trees that are found at lower altitudes also, but some really 
spe=
cial trees are found at very high altitudes only. If one has such a fruit, =
it 
shows that one has climbed great heights. Similarly, some siddhis do no=
t mean 
much, but some siddhis are very special and only really elevated sa=
dhakas can 
obtain them (whether by trying or without trying). If a sadhaka=
s demonstrates 
such a siddhi, you can see that one progressed a lot. Howev=
er, the key is that 
one who climbed the same or more distance may not have=
 that or any other fruit. 

=C2=A0 
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * 
=C2=A0 
Unlike in the=
 example of climbing hill, which is an external activity, spiritual 
progre=
ss in real life is *internal*. There is NO way for anyone to know for sure =

how much progress one has made, how much self-control one has internally a=
nd 
what exactly goes on in one's mind. We may try to judge it from externa=
l factors 
such as actions, words etc, but it is not necessarily accurate. =


=C2=A0 
Here, some people swayed by siddhis may be tempted to use one's s=
iddhis to judge 
how high one climbed. But that is faulty. One person who r=
eached the absolute 
top may not have any fruits, while one person who stil=
l has ways to climb may 
have gotten some really nice fruit. Using externas=
lly demonstrable siddhis that 
are neither necessary nor sufficient for Sel=
f-realization as a measure of one's 
progress is unsound. 

=C2=A0 
Given t=
hat spiritual progress is internal, how can we judge it and compare 
people=
 then? Well, we need not and should not. Only a sarvaantaryaami - a 
perfec=
ted being who has access to each being's internal state - can do that.

=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * 
=C2=A0 
Rajarshi, you are assuming that Ramakrishn=
a Paramahamsa is a Paramahamsa on 
Vimalananda's scale. You are concluding =
that Ramakrishna is a Paramahamsa; 
Abhedananda, Vivekananda etc are lower =
than that; Vimalananda is a rishi; and 
hence Vimalananda is superior to Ab=
hedananda and Vivekananda by 2pwr16 to 2. 

=C2=A0 
Is Paramahamsa Nithyana=
nda, who was caught in a sex scandal, also a Paramahamsa 
because he is kno=
wn so? See, how people are famously known may or may not 
reflect their spi=
ritual stature. Real spiritual stature is internal and you 
cannot see it. =


=C2=A0 
We do not know who Ramakrishna Paramahamsa really is. He may not =
be just a 
paramahamsa on Vimalananda's scale, but be a siddha or a natha o=
r even a rishi. 
He may even be Vishnu himself, as he himself said and some=
 religious experts of 
that time declared based on various signs. If Ramakr=
ishna Paramahamsa is Vishnu 
himself, Vivekananda, Abhedananda etc can defi=
nitely be rishis or naths in 
Vimalananda's scale. If your argument is that=
 they cannot be because they did 
not demonstrate siddhis compatible with t=
hat status, that is a non-point as I 
explained above. The disagreement bet=
ween then boils down a difference in the 
relevance and importance of exter=
nally demonstrated siddhis. 

=C2=A0 
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * 
=C2=A0 
Why this is r=
elevant and I spent some time on this is that some people seem to 
have mis=
conceptions. The take home for some people from some books describing 
mira=
cles and siddhis may be that siddhis are important. 

=C2=A0 
Vasishtha is =
not only a rishi, but one of saptarshis. Please read what he taught 
Lord R=
ama in Yoga Vaasishtham. It is the essence of Veda and Upanishad. It will 
=
balance your views and mould your attitude. Read Yoga Vaasishtham. Siddhis =
are 
neither necessary nor sufficient for self-realization. Don't be distra=
cted by 
them or be infatuated with them. 

=C2=A0 
The goal of sadhana is =
that your notions of "this is I and these are mine" get 
subtler and subtle=
r and hold of six internal enemies on you becomes weaker and 
weaker. Other=
s may or may not be able to see and judge your progress, but you 
know your=
 progress and weaknesses the best. THAT is the crux and siddhis have no 
re=
levance or meaning. Any fascination for them will set you back in your 
sad=
hana.

ishi who came down. An amsa is not a Rishi in fullforce, but sufficient par=
t of the Rishi's consciousness that comes down for a secific purpose and on=
ce the purpose is served, goes back to the source. Similar for the 6 Nitya-=
Siddhas. Therefore, very technically, Swami Vivekananda is an *amsa* of a R=
ishi, a projection of a Rishi. Not the Rishi is full. BTW, all of these Sid=
dhas, Naths, Munis etc are projection Rishis one way or the other. Each is =
kept is ingorance of their real being (Rishi) such that the play can go on =
(not my words, Vimalananda's words). They are Nitya-siddha because even if =
they take birth over and over, being parts of extremely higher beings, thes=
