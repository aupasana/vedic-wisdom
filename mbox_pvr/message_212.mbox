Subject: Vimalananda and Aghora Books (Re: On Akbar)

Namaste Kumar ji,

Vimalananda did not write the books. He was a yogi who lived his life freely 
and shunned publicity. Even people close to him did not know about his 
abilities and very few knew what he was capable of. He gave a lot of 
freewheeling talks to Robert Svoboda on many aspects of spirituality and 
made the latter take down notes. He asked him to publish them after he left 
the body. Thus, the books were published after Vimalananda left the world. 
He did not want any attention while living.

In my humble opinion, these books are a divinely inspired work and 
Vimalananda was someone who experienced the highest states of consciousness. 
He must be a reborn rishi. However, I must warn you that these books may 
shock some of you and put you off.

Most religious practices maintain some level of external purity. Even though 
we say that "all is Brahman", we treat different objects differently and 
consider some objects as "pure" and some as "impure".

In aghora, the faith in the internal purity of everything is so high that 
external purity is de-emphasized and seemingly gross and disgusting things 
are practiced, just so that one overcomes aversion and attraction for things 
and sees all as one (Brahman). The path of aghora is not for everyone. A 
very high level of internal purity is required for success in it. Without 
it, one should not attempt it, because one is guaranteed to fall.

There is no doubt that these are fantastic books that are directly inspired 
by Mother Smashaana Taaraa. I recommend them to every spiritual seeker who 
is curious about tantric practices, with the cautionary word  that you 
should be prepared to be shocked.

Here are the links in Amazon:

(1) "Aghora, At the Left Hand of God" by Robert E Svoboda
http://www.amazon.com/AGHORA-Left-Hand-God-Aghora/dp/0914732218

(2) "Aghora II: Kundalini" by Robert E Svoboda
http://www.amazon.com/AGHORA-II-Kundalini-Aghora/dp/0914732315

(3) "Aghora III: The Law of Karma" by Robert E Svoboda
http://www.amazon.com/Aghora-III-Karma-Robert-Svoboda/dp/0914732374

The first book is awe-inspiring and tends to catch the imagination with its 
magical tales. It is a popular book. The second book is even more insightful 
and full of genuine knowledge. There is a lot of nonsense on Kundalini out 
there and this is the most genuine book. The third book is the least popular 
of the series, but perhaps the best. Overall, these books have a lot of deep 
knowledge in coded form, provided one overcomes the initial shock and gets a 
sense of what aghora is all about.

Vimalananda had a darshan of Smashaana Taaraa when he was 20 or 21 and kept 
seeing Her almost every night. He basically learnt about everything from Her 
directly.

Best regards,
Narasimha
