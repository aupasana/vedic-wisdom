  Namaste friends,

  This is what I r=
ecommend:

  Say "Om Bhur bhuvah suvah" once in the beginning. Then start r=
epeating the following:

  Om tatsavitur .... varenyam Om

  This is what s=
hould be repeated for one mala or two malas or, as Manish said below, 10 ma=
las.

  *        *        *

  I know something about Manish. He has the ra=

oistic people into detached persons fulfilling their dharma without ego. I =
know that there is some power in his words. The following is a specific adv=

            Dear Naras=
imha,

            When the sadhaka effaces his own personality such that t=
he deity of the mantra comes and occupies him, then at that stage there is =

            no real difference between the sadhaka and the Deity(even if t=
he deity is with the sadhaka all day I would say that there is no real diff=
erence).
            The difference that one feels is as follows:
         =
   One feels a strange coolness on the skin and on the eyes.
            A =
few repititions of the mantra bring about a situation where the deity posse=
sses the sadhaka and the sadhaka's prana goes upward very quickly( Urdhwa R=
etas), 
            During all meditation the sadhaka sees the feet or clot=
hes or hands or face, etc of the deity sitting beside him along with minute=
 details of the room (even though the sadhak's eyes are closed).
          =
  The sadhak typically becomes dreamless except for suchaka dreams.
       =
     The whole day the sadhaka behaves like a love lorn person. How can i a=
gain experience the Beloved.
            That then is the experience of man=
tra when it is done correctly.
            When the sadhak's personality is=
 effaced such that the deity's personality sits there then the sadhak exper=
iences himself as that Deity(Devata).
            There then arises no diff=
erence in the sadhak or the deity commanding a certain thing to happen( be =
it what appears to be good or be it that which appears to be bad) . The dei=
ty's personality is crucial. Ugra devatas make the person care almost for n=
othing himself, so self identification is minimised and the person's spirit=
ual evolution continues.
            Remember, there is very little accordi=
ng to me which is black magic. It is all a use of Shakti. If your Shakti an=
d deity is a higher shakti such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinn=
amasta, then your power will be that of God himself( Provided you have Vijn=
ana). After the death of the body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the de=
ity or if he was originally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm reser=
ved for these beings. 
            Attacking such a sadhak brings the full =
bearing of karma onto the heads of the attackers and some people may realis=
e this to their detriment( Patan comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city=
 of Patan with his Shakti causing an earthquake). Some people may even equa=
te this with black magic. Here there is only action and reaction.(Bit like =
you attack a normal person, and you will get a result of this from that sam=
e Atma whom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack som=
ebody who is identifying with the universe and has very few karmas left, th=
en the Universe itself attacks you, because your attack is not on the sadha=
ka, but on his identification, ie God or the universe).
            If peop=
le persist in using the Shakti possesed by a small Pisacha, Bhuta, then the=
re is only a little Shakti which can be used, moreover then their minds and=
 intellects will not be free of identification with the body and so their a=
ctions are those which are generally termed as black magic. These people us=
ually join the same spirits which they have been using after death, this is=
 not an enjoyable experience.
            Imagine if somebody is worshippin=
g Chandika for a few lifetimes, then even in this birth he or she is drawn =
to that deity and such a sadhak may acheive after a few repitions of a mant=
ra(because of his previous effort).
            On the other hand somebody =
doing this mantra only in this lifetime may feel that the 64 things which b=
ind every mantra are crucial and may not acheive in this lifetime.
        =
    According to me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let me su=
ggest an easy sadhana.
            If one is so inclined, then starting on =
some good day, do 1000 reititions of the Savitri(some call this the Gayatri=
, but the real Gayatri is hidden) every day, main constraints
            S=
ame time every day.
            Same place.
            Same materials.
   =
         Same direction.
            As little movement as one can.
       =
     Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.
            Comple=
te restraint on sex(from the mind and the body, not just the body), reduce =
food intake, grow a beard.
            Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, m=

            Continue this =
for 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 times.
            See the diffe=

              I mentioned the above with respect to the need of =
thousands of mantras and technicalities. If one does not want to command go=
d and wants to be a beggar who will take whatever is given, there is no nee=
d for thousands of mantras and all the umpteen technicalities. These thousa=
nds of mantras and umpteen technicalities are for commanding thousands of d=
ifferent results from god. That is why I talked of commanding vs begging. H=
owever, this commanding works slightly differently than one may imagine. I =
will elaborate.

              Also, commanding god is NOT black magic. Com=
manding low level beings is black magic, which can be accomplished even by =
a person not quite elevated spiritually and suffering from a heavy ego. How=
ever, commanding higher beings such as gods is possible only for a spiritua=
lly elevated person with no or extremely small ego. This commanding that I =
am referring to is not an egoistic achievement. In fact, an egoist cannot a=
chieve it. Only a person succeeding in completely effacing individual ego c=
an achieve this commanding! I will repeat something from the previous mail =
to clarify:

              The universe has many lokas (planes of conscious=
ness), many beings and many objects. There are infinite karmic interactions=
 possible between them. Accordingly, there are infinite possible mantras. W=
hen one is able to perfectly control the mind and *fill it* with a mantra (=
i.e. no thoughts but the mantra reverberating in the mind constantly), then=
 one experiences the mantra. This perfect absorption of self-awareness in t=
he mantra then causes internal changes by the flow of energy internally in =
specific ways (specific to the mantra) and that causes corresponding extern=
al changes in the universe and corresponding karmic interactions between va=
rious objects.

              Each set of "karmic interactions between vari=
ous objects" is a "result". Various mantras are for various "results". One =
may term merging self-awareness in a mantra fully and getting a specific re=
sult from it as "commanding a result" from god. Whether you like the term o=
r not, it is essentially that.

              *        *        *

        =
      But the bottomline is this: Only a highly purified sadhaka of very lo=
w ego can command specific results from god (not for selfishness or even eg=
o satisfaction, but acting as an unattached instrument of Nature fulfilling=
 one's dharma set by Nature). Various mantras and technicalities of mantra =
shastra taught by rishis are meant for such sadhakas.

              Those =
are hardly of use to so many people out there with dense egos seeking speci=
fic selfish results. They cannot command specific results from god (because=
 of their heavy attachment to the result, which is in turn due to their own=
 attachment to a limited ego), even if they use all the techniques of mantr=
a shastra and all the associated rules of astrology. Instead of wasting the=
ir time with these technicalities, they will be better off learning to be g=
ood beggars at God's door.

              Just pick any prasiddha mantra or=
 a mantra you feel attracted to, without worrying about so many technicalit=
ies, and learn to be humble and surrender to the Lord. Patiently wait for h=
im to give you what you want. Like a beggar, take whatever and whenever he =
gives.

              Keep praying every day or every second when you are a=
ble to. Even when you are not praying, remember him in all of your actions.=
 When you enjoy something in the material world, tell yourself that it is h=
is and that he gave it to you. If you remember him all the time, slowly the=
 dirt in your mind will start to get cleaned. This fixing of attitude is fa=
aaaaaaaaaaar more important than picking the right mantra, right weekday, r=
ight tithi etc (that too based on unreliable knowledge coming from question=
able sources!).

              *        *        *

              There may=
 be a mountain with thousands of paths (mantra) for climbing it. Each path =
may lead to a different spot (different experience) on the top and show a d=
ifferent scenery (result). Expert advisors (astrologers) may tell you to us=
e a specific path (mantra) to see a specific scenery (result). But such adv=
ice is useless to a handicapped person without legs (a selfish person with =
dense ego). It is relevant only to person with legs and one who is strong a=
nd sturdy, who can successfully climb the mountain (a reasonably detached p=
erson with very little ego).

              Even when you encounter a perso=
n who has legs and can actually climb the mountain, the stress should be on=
 how to climb the mountain and traverse the long path, rather than which pa=
th to take. The astrologers who are bogged down by all the technicalities a=
nd people who take customized mantra advice from astrologers and think that=
 they will get a result quickly by doing that 'powerful' mantra are missing=
 the basic point. The power of a powerful mantra is with respect to the exp=
erience and result obtained *after* one succeeds with the mantra. A partcic=
ularly powerful mantra is akin to a path leading to a point atop the mounta=
in where the view shows a particularly beautiful scenery. But the bottomlin=
e is that you do have to survive the climb along the long path.

          =
    We need to emphasize the attitude and approach needed for the long clim=
b, rather than emphasizing the choice of the path based on horoscope. It is=
 worth noting that so many great spiritual teachers who came in the last ce=

etc. Instead, they emphasized having the correct attitude - surrender, subm=
ission, devotion, patience, persistence, discipline, humility etc!!!! *That=

      =
        Dear Sanjay,

              > Since you do not have any real defini=
tion of Gandanta, I am dropping that

              I do have a definition =
of gandanta, which is Parasara's definition in BPHS.

              Since s=
ome of you are extrapolating it based on the fire embodied in UL and water =
embodied in tithis, the onus is on you to outline and justify your definiti=
on. I got into this thread because statements were made that fasting on par=
ticular weekdays or tithis in a chart can cause "insult to Vishnu", "seriou=
s doshas" and "danger to spouse", based on these far-fetched extrapolations=
 of gandanta.

              > Which is perfectly in line with everything I=
 have learnt.

              Well, you once taught that houses represent Su=
n/Shiva/truth and arudhas represent Moon/Gouri/perception. That was meaning=
ful. Now, you associated UL, an arudha, with Sun and fire and 12th, a house=
, with Gouri and water. I question whether the new theory on fasting is rea=
lly in line with everything you have learnt (and taught).

              BT=
W, I specifically asked for a clarification on whether this was based on yo=
ur own thinking or from classics/parampara (see quoted mail below for the f=
ull context). Like so many times with similar questions I asked privately a=

          =
    First of all, Parasara did *not* prescribe fasting on specific weekdays=
 or tithis based on any arudhas or houses in a chart.

              For do=
shas in birth chart or to get relief from planetary afflictions or to get t=
he blessings of planets, he suggested various *homas* (fire rituals) and de=
scribed how to perform them. His section on remedial measures is full of va=
rious homas. I am not dismissing those remedies taught by Parasara himself =
and I am in fact slowly preparing manuals on them so that anybody can do th=

              Parasara did *not* specify the weekday or =

ecific birth doshas (e.g. Amavasya dosha or Moola dosha), he fixed the tith=
i or nakshatra based on the dosha and the deity. But the days are not based=
 on any house or arudha in the chart.

              Thus, the principles I=
 am questioning are *not* from Parasara.

              Second, I said what=
 I said in a *context*. People are mentioning complicated principles that a=
re not found in classics or works of rishis and scaring people that perform=
ing austerities such as fasting on certain days cause "danger to spouse" or=
 "serious doshas" or "insult to Vishnu", based on horoscope. I find these p=

and that doing it on a "wrong day" does not cause danger as being suggested=

              Third, our shastras primarily talk about worshipping vario=

              =
I did not say it is "useless". Instead, I suggest that our ability to use i=
t is limited and we should take our limitations into consideration.

      =
        The universe has many lokas (planes of consciousness), many beings =
and many objects. There are infinite karmic interactions possible between t=
hem. Accordingly, there are infinite possible mantras. When one is able to =
perfectly control the mind and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts bu=
t the mantra reverberating in the mind constantly), then one experiences th=
e mantra. This perfect absorption of self-awareness in the mantra then caus=
es internal changes by the flow of energy internally in specific ways (spec=
ific to the mantra) and that causes corresponding external changes in the u=
niverse and corresponding karmic interactions between various objects.

   =
           However, this variety of mantras, experiences and results is irr=
elevant to one who does not have such perfect control over the mind to abso=
rb the mind fully in a mantra. It is relevant only to a seer whose self-awa=
reness is quite evolved and hence control over mind impeccable. Such seers =
are extremely extremely rare today. Most people are unable to experience an=
y mantra and mantras do not work for them as they are supposed to.

       =
       *        *        *

              Just repeating a combination of s=
ounds does not guarantee anything. Some people may think that certain resul=
ts come when they repeat a mantra certain number of times. That is an incor=
rect notion. A mantra may work for one person quickly and another may spend=
 the whole life chanting it and nothing may happen. Absorption of the entir=
e mind into a mantra is needed for a mantra to really work and it is much m=
ore difficult than one may think.

              *        *        *

     =
         A highly learned scholar in the court of a king may be able to com=
mand the king and get whatever he wants from king. An incapable one is bett=
er off begging the king, rather than trying to command (and failing for sur=
e).

              Similarly, most people are better off begging god for wh=
at they want rather than trying to use the right mantra to command what the=
y want. A beggar does not need a huge vocabulary or great scholarship or kn=
owledge. Feeling of humility and helplessness, surrender, patience and pers=
istence are what help a beggar succeed. A beggar needs the right attitude r=
ather than knowledge. In this age and time, best bet for most people is to =
learn to be a good beggar at god's door.

              What people today n=
eed for material and spiritual progress through remedial measures is a bett=
er attitude in begging god rather than a better choice of tools such as man=
tras and other specifics such as weekday, tithi etc to command a specific r=
esult from god.

              It is worth noting that so many great spirit=
ual teachers who came in the last century or two did not emphasize picking =
the right mantra based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasized having th=
e correct attitude - surrender, submission, devotion, patience, persistence=
, discipline, humility etc. *That* is a lot more important and useful than =
trying to be oversmart with the choice of mantra, day etc and impress god.
=

              *        *        *

              One more thing. We have m=
any mantras given by rishis, but the guidelines from rishis like Parasara o=
n how to pick a mantra based on the horoscope are very limited. Astrologers=
 today do not operate solely based on them. They use all kinds of other rul=
es coming from various traditions. They are not free from corruption and im=
perfection. Most scriptures associate various mantras with various results,=
 irrespective of horoscope. For example, irrespective of who is the 6th lor=
d and 8th lord and lord of A6 and A8, Rina Vimochaka Angaraka mantra is goo=
d for debt control. And so on. Linking of horoscope is overplayed by today'=
s astrologers, way beyond the scope of Parasara's guidelines.

            =
  If one has a sadguru, I recommend following the word of sadguru rather th=
an that of an astrology theoretician.

              If not, there is no fo=
olproof way to know the right path. Pick any path (given by an astrologer o=
r one that you feel attracted to) instead of wasting time and then keep wor=
king on your attitude. The latter is the key. As I said earlier, learn to b=
e a humble beggar at god's door. Choice of Mantra is secondary and attitude=
 is primary. If you succeed in being a really humble beggar, you stand a be=
tter chance of success than great scholars.

              Any prasiddha ma=
ntra (e.g. ashtakshari, panchakshari, dwadasakshari, navakshari, vishnu sah=
asranaam, rudram, hare krishna maha mantra, chandipath, ganapati atharva se=
ersham, mrityunjaya mantra etc) can help one make progress if one develops =
the right attitude. Without the right attitude, even an impeaccably picked =
mantra will do nothing.

              *        *        *

              I=
 hope this sufficiently clarifies my stand. I discuss these matters related=
 to spiritual sadhana more on the vedic-wisdom yahoogroup. Some writings ar=

                Dear Narasimha,

    =
            Since you do not have any real definition of Gandanta, I am dro=
pping that and continue with my belief of the junction between Agni and Jal=
a rasi as the case of gandanta and the loka junctions. Which is perfectly i=
n line with everything I have learnt.

                Two statements you h=
ave made contradict standard texts on Jyotish and Mantra Shastra. Please co=
rrect me if I am not understanding you well out here -

                1. =
Statement 1: *fasting on any day or any tithi* is good so long as the sanka=
lpa has been made for the devata you intend to pray to. Results maybe a bit=
 delayed but will be there.
                2. Statement 2: *reciting any p=
rayer* will give the desired effects for any ailment we wish to remedy

   =
             Is this what you intended to say or did I get this wrong?

   =
             Statement 1 is an arrogance that the entire Jyotisha shastra i=
s bogus and has no relevance as the remedial measures prescribed by Parasar=
a and others to be done on specific days are irrlevant and not of much cons=
equence. This sounds like another astrologer I had known some time back who=
se statements like this coerced me to write Vedic Remedies in Astrology so =
that people are not misled but such pretexts to knowledge.

               =
 Statement 2 is an arrogance that the entire mantra shastra is useless and =
the Rishi=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s were wasting time in giving so many mant=
ras for the same devata, like say thousands of mantras for Vishnu or Hanuma=
n when any one mantra would suffice. OR it is like saying that we can take =
paracetamol and pray that cancer is cured. I think I may have to write a bo=
ok on Mantra Shastra to validate the teachings of the vedic seers.

       =
         I think there is something wrong in the way you are saying what yo=
u want to say. Please rethink and correct your statements for the sake of g=
ood record in this list.

                With Warm Regards

wer.
                >>>>>> End quote >>>>>>

                [Narasimha] W=
e always say that houses (truth) are represented by Sun (aatman) and arudha=
 padas (maya) by Moon (mind).

                Thus, 12th house is the actu=
al creator and UL is the apparent creator in the field of maya. Houses (tru=
th) should actually be associated with Sun (aatman) and Shiva (and not Gour=
i), while arudha padas (perception) should actually be associated with Moon=
 (mind) and Gouri. After all, that is what we do in the tripod method in da=
sa judgment.

                Thus, it is actually more logical to say that=
 12th house and 12th lord imbibe the agni tattva of Sun and UL and UL lord =
imbibe the jala tattva of Moon.

                Is the above "*more correc=
t* answer" based on your own thinking or is it from a classic or from tradi=
tion?

                <<<<<< Begin quote <<<<<< 
              > The mantr=

many times better than complete fasting.

              >>>>>> End quote >>=
>>>>

              [Narasimha] Well, if one cannot fast, then one is desti=
ned to expend some energy on digestion after all and not focus all energy o=
n the mantra. But the bottomline is that shastras say that one should medit=
ate either without or with very little food (niraahaaro mitaahaaro). In any=
 case, I hope we agree that meditation sessions after heavy eating are heav=
ily restrained in effectiveness.

              >>>>>> End quote >>>>>>

              [Naras=
imha] Putting a burning match in a glass of water does indeed kill fire. Bu=
t the question is of contact. If I am thinking of fire in my mind while sta=
nding in water, it does not kill the fire. There is no contact.

          =
    My point is that the examples given have no real identifiable contact b=
etween water and fire.

              One can be creative and come up with =
a lot of theories. For example, one can say that Moon and Venus are jala ta=
ttva and all rasis show agni tattva (then why are some rasis marked as agni=
 rasis and some as water rasis etc) and hence the sign occupied by Moon and=
 Venus cause contact between water and fire. Then one can say fasting on th=
e weekdays of the dispositors of Moon and Venus causes gandanta and serious=
 danger.

              It is not enough to show some fire and some water. =
See what counts as contact. Otherwise, one will engage in illogical extrapo=
lations.

              [Narasimha] Nothing is permanent. What is one's cannot be=
 taken away. And one cannot cling on to what is not one's. Some rejoice whe=
n it seems like something comes and cry when it seems like something leaves=
. Some impassionately observe as things seem to come and go and do what the=
y see as their dharma with the things they seem to have.

              Jus=
t a factual correction though
              : I never said I was leaving Jy=
otish. For a few years after my spiritual master entered my life, my intere=
st in other things went down (though I continued to do other things) and my=
 focus on spiritual sadhana intensified. So I said that my interest in Jyot=
ish was very low. However, my guru gave me a task later. He wanted me to st=
udy the teachings of Parasara independently, meditate on them and share my =
interpretations with the world. He said I was very passionate in my Jyotish=
 activities earlier, and he wanted me to do the same now but dispassionatel=
y and without an attachment. He felt that I still have a contribution to ma=
ke to Jyotish and wants me to do it as an unattached karma. His word is eve=
rything for me.

              What I told you recently is not that I was l=
eaving Jyotish but what I said above.

              However, if your judgm=
ent is correct and if Jyotish is indeed "leaving" me, I am sure my spiritua=
l guru will realize it sooner or later and change his command to me.

his is a fine  statement but then you seem to be saying that the Puranas an=

right as it will be spiritually beneficial. For example, a person wishing t=

the same) or any tithi (all tithi are the same) and start fasting and do a =
mantra (any mantra!!) and then in a few days, or (maybe) a few months (or m=
aybe) a few years ... or maybe (what you did not say), a few lifetimes, the=
 marriage will happen! I cannot say you are wrong, so I agree that what you=
 say is right.

              >>>>>> End quote >>>>>>

              [Naras=
imha] This is a gross exaggeration.

              Is all that is being tau=
ght and practiced now strictly from "Puranas and other teachings of the see=
rs"?

              I did not say all days and tithis are the same. Of cour=
se, there is some difference. But, it is not as big as being made here.

  =
            To make khoa, whether one uses cow milk or buffalo milk or milk=
 of a brown cow or a black cow or a Jersey cow or another cow does make som=
e difference. But it is secondary. To say that "danger" and "serious doshas=
" (see the quoted mails for such claims) can be caused by a wrong choice is=
 wrong. To say that a wrong choice means khoa will take 100 years to make i=
s also a gross exaggeration.

              The main thing is that you need=
 milk and sugar. If one is confused by endless claims of khoa making consul=
tants and ends up not making khoa at all, that will be sad. In such a case,=
 one can simply pick some milk or the other, take sugar and start cooking k=
hoa. It will take an extra half hour, but the job will be done.

          =
    I request Jyotishis to behave responsibly and humbly and not engage in =
scare-mongering and say that a speicifc austerity (fasting on a specific we=
ekday or tithi in a chart) can cause "danger" and "serious doshas". No wond=
er some spiritual teachers look down upon Jyotish and dismiss it. Such unba=
lanced attitude and self-importance from us does not help our cause!

     =
         Yes, Jyotish is helpful, but let us not oversell it or overplay th=
e importance...

              <<<<<< Begin quote <<<<<< 
              > G=
em stones may harm when used incorrectly. But, austerities like prayers, fa=
sting, mouna vrata and brahmacharya will NEVER do you any harm. If your bod=

calculations.
              > 
              > [Sanjay Rath:] Brahmacharya =
is good for someone planning to have a baby or one who cannot conceive and =
this is kept for some period before the appointed date of nisheka. Brahmach=
arya is good for marriage?! I think you are mistaking abstinence from physi=
cal union as Brahmacharya. Oh no its so different.

              >>>>>> En=
d quote >>>>>>

              [Narasimha] Of course, brahmacharya is much m=
ore, but also very difficult for most. Even physical celibacy is a good eno=
ugh austerity. Physical celibacy over an extended period of time increases =
the efficacy of other austerities such as fasting, mouna vrata, meditation =
and homam.
