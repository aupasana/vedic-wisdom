Dear Rajarshi and others,
=A0
On this auspicious Rishi Panchami day, may th=
e blessings of rishis be with us in our pursuit of Arsha Vidya!
=A0
Subtle =
teachings of rishis need to be understood "holistically". If one wants to u=
se=A0 puranas but ignore vedangas, or use tantras but ignore puranas or use=
 upanishads but ignore tantras, etc, one may miss some clues and may not be=
 able to put it all together.
=A0
Jyotisha is a vedanga and said to be the =
"eye" of Veda. It supplies a framwework to understand this creation and how=
 One Self relates to many selves. It is not a wise idea to dump Parasara's =
teachings on core philosophy just because they do not seem to fit one's vie=
ws. Instead, I suggest trying harder to understand.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
If one is uncomfortable with Rama-Sun and =
Krishna-Moon link and thinks it belittles Krishna, perhaps one misunderstoo=
d something. Let me try to address a few possible misconceptions.
=A0
Sun s=
hows soul and Moon shows mind, but that soul is not the same as "Aatman". A=
atman or Brahman is The Self that manifests as everything that exists. Indi=
vidual soul and mind are both specific and limited manifestations of Self a=
nd one cannot say which is superior. In fact, they are incomplete without t=
he other and are a team that work *together*. In fact, they are two sides o=
f the same thing.
=A0
Same is true with Shiva tattva and Shakti tattva repr=
esented by soul (Sun) and mind (Moon). Neither is complete without the othe=
r.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
First, let us as=
k: What is Shiva tattva and what is Shakti tattva?
=A0
<<I understand Shiva=
 tattwa as detachment. Shakti tattwa is any form and manner and display of =
Shakti (this is the most fluid definition).>>
=A0
Rajarshi, that is not a "=
fluid definition" but a NON-definition - defining Shakti as Shakti.
=A0
If =
Shiva tattva is detachment, is Shakti tattva attachment?? If Shakti tattva =
is about display of shakti, is Shiva tattva about hiding of Shakti or havin=
g no Shakti? I think these cliched definitions are not particularly insight=
ful.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
<<Shiva is Unm=
anifested Absolute>>
=A0
Though people sometimes say that Shiva is the unma=
nifested Self, it is just a manner of speaking and not accurate. Shiva and =
Shakti are both *manifestations* arising from Self, whose play manifests so=
 many other beings. Neither is really identical to unmanifested Self.
=A0
T=
his is my "fluid definition": Shiva tattva is the cosmic *potential* energy=
 of manifested consciousness and Shakti tattva is its cosmic *kinetic* ener=
gy.
=A0
As Shiva tattva allows one close to being established in Self to re=
main so, while Shakti tattva may draw one away from it, people loosely say =
that Shiva is the unmanifested Self. But that is not accurate. Also, Shakti=
 tattva has 2 aspects. The force of this kinetic energy can work in two way=
s - the force of Maya Shakti pulls beings away from Self and creates many b=
usy selves, whereas the force of Chit Shakti takes one back.
=A0
Potential =
energy is the reservoir from which kinetic energy is generated/increased. T=
hus, Shiva is the source of Shakti and there is no Shakti without Shiva. On=
 the other hand, unless it is converted to kinetic energy and put to use, p=
otential energy has no meaning or purpose. Even its existence may be questi=
oned. Just as sunrays do not exist without Sun while Sun has no meaning or =
purpose without sunrays (even his existence may be questioned then), Shiva =
and Shakti are incomplete without the other. Just as Sun and sunrays illumi=
ne everything together, Shiva and Shakti manifest this entire cosmos *toget=
her*.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
One may imagi=
ne Shiva as a detached person sitting in smashan and meditating. But that i=
s just one aspect and one imagery. Detachment does not mean disinterest or =
inaction.
=A0
If you look at Puranas and Tantras, so much of the knowledge =
was taught by Shiva to Parvati (or vice versa). Shiva is of course a great =
scholar and expert in all things you mentioned when questioning Hanuman bei=
ng Shiva tattva ("an expert in all forms of music, expert in poetry, expert=
 in grammer/logic, expert in speech, a pundit of the highest order, a very =
multifaceted character").
=A0
Also, consider the imagery of Shiva being fie=
rcely angry when his wife Sati being insulting and giving up her life and S=
hiva wreaking havoc on Daksha's yajnashala. Does that come across as detach=
ment to you? You quoted incidents from Rama's life like crying for Sita to =
question his "detachment". Though such incidents in Rama's life do go again=
st cliched understanding of detachment and Shiva tattva, you have to realiz=
e that Shiva himself had similar incidents.
=A0
Sub-consciously, some peopl=
e may associate detachment with disinterest or aloofness or not caring or i=
naction. That is incorrect. Detachment is internal. It is possible to be ca=
lm and stone-faced externally, while there is deep attachment internally. I=
t is also possible to behave angrily or passionately while there is no atta=
chment in the heart. Detachment is an internal state and not a property of =
external signs. When you are looking at actions of higher beings, be more a=
ware of this. Most importantly, if one starts taking things with deep esote=
ric meaning at a superficial external level, one will start having all conf=
usions.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
It is not t=
hat Shiva does not care or is disinterested in worldly things. After all, h=
e is the reservoir of potential energy that runs the cosmos. Shakti extract=
s energy from him and puts it to use by converting into kinetic energy.
=A0=

Now, Shiva is disinterested in the sense that he absolutely does not care =
for what purpose the energy is used by Shakti. Whatever it is, he unfailing=
ly and uncomplainingly provides Shakti with the energy she needs.
=A0
You c=
an look at Shakti as an aspect of Shiva that puts *his* energy to use and y=
ou can also look Shiva as an aspect of Shakti that stores *her* energy. The=
y are a team that work together managing this field of duality and insepara=
ble really. They can be viewed as one also.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
As soul is a spark of Shiva tattva and mind is a s=
park of shakti tattva, the same holds in the case of soul and mind of indiv=
idual beings. Soul provides the support mind needs for its various pursuits=
. Whatever activity one engages in, it is not possible without the willing =
support of soul. But it is happening because mind envisioned it and wanted =
it. Again, soul and mind are a team and two sides of the same coin of indiv=
idual consciousness.
=A0
All of us do have soul and mind. Rama and Krishna =
also had them. But my point was that Rama's life is a story representation =
of how an individual soul operates at an esoteric level and serves its purp=
ose. Similarly, Krishna's life is a story representation of how a perfected=
 mind operates at an esoterical level and serves its purpose.
=A0
*=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
One disagreement we had was w.=
r.t. "full" avataras. Just to re-iterate, I don't believe in "full" avatara=
s as you envision. In the analogy below, Ganga water is paramatmamsa and ta=
p water is jivatmamsa.
=A0
Many vessels may contain tap water with a few dr=
ops of Ganga water added (a normal being). Some vessels may contain 40% tap=
 water and 60% Ganga water (amsavatara). Some rare vessels may contain 100%=
 Ganga water (poornavatara). But no vessel can contain "Full Ganga", which =
can only flow outside and not fit in any vessel! The reason you take Ganga =
water in a vessel is for a specific purpose and you just take a vessel that=
 suits the purpose.
=A0
Same thing holds with avataras. Ethereal beings exi=
st in their "full" form ethereally. When they take a form on earth, it is w=
hat suffices the purpose. It is like a vessel holding Ganga water.
=A0
If t=
he vessel itself claims "don't think that I am this vessel, I am Ganga wate=
r itself", it is not incorrect. But it is also not correct if you understan=
d that that particular vessel is the best and contains "full Ganga".
=A0
*=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Now let me extend this a=
nalogy to the basic disagreement that started this whole discussion.
=A0
Th=
ere were 9 vessels. First vessel was very small (fish form). Next vessel wa=
s bigger (more evolved turtle form). Next vessel is bigger (boar). Next ves=
sel was even bigger (half-man). Next vessel was bigger (full man, but dwarf=
). Next vessel was bigger (full man, but passionate). Next vessel was bigge=
r. Next vessel was the same size, but had a very nice design and some prais=
ed it as "Ganga water itself". Next vessel was the same size, but having ve=
ry plain design.
=A0
Someone (Rajarshi) came along and said, "I see a clear=
 pattern of evolution of purity. So the last vessel does not belong. Throw =
it out." He also said that the 8th vessel was Ganga itself.
=A0
Someone els=
e (Narasimha) came along and said, "well, vessels 3, 4, 7 and 8 are filled =
with 100% Ganga water, while vessels 5 and 6 are not. Don't conclude that a=
bout purity from the outside and look inside." He also said that no vessel =
was Ganga itself, though 4 vessels contained 100% Ganga water.
=A0
*=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Let me be absolutely clear abo=
ut one thing. Though it may have seemed like Rajarshi was batting for Krish=
na and I for Rama, I do not have such divisions in my mind. Though Shiva & =
Shakti or soul & mind play slightly different roles, I see them as two aspe=
cts of a single manifestation. In fact, I suggest that one cannot understan=
d Shiva tattva perfectly without also understanding Shakti tattva perfectly=
, and vice versa. I will in fact say the same thing about Rama tattva and K=
rishna tattva.
=A0
Also, I always like focusing on the boundaries of differ=
ences of opinion with like-minded people, to improve collective understandi=
ng.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
> I rest my cas=
e!-:)
=A0
Yes Rajarshi, your "case" is really tired from jumping all over t=
he place frantically and do please give it some "rest"! ;-)
=A0
Seriously t=
hough, I share my thoughts with you not because my knowledge is perfect or =
superior, but because sharing what I see may oneday contribute towards perf=
ect knowledge in *someone*. There are some really sincere seekers of Arsha =
Vidya here. You are especially at the forefront of them, Rajarshi. So I res=
pectfully, humbly and lovingly submit my confident, but fallible, views.
=
=A0
Best wishes for Rishi Panchami again!
=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

;  *<br> <br>Now let me extend this analogy to the basic disagree=
ment that started this whole discussion.<br> <br>There were 9 vessels.=

 First vessel was very small (fish form). Next vessel was bigger (more evo=
lved turtle form). Next vessel is bigger (boar). Next vessel was even bigge=
r (half-man). Next vessel was bigger (full man, but dwarf). Next vessel was=
 bigger (full man, but passionate). Next vessel was bigger. Next vessel was=
 the same size, but had a very nice design and some praised it as "Ganga wa=
ter itself". Next vessel was the same size, but having very plain design.<b=
r> <br>Someone (Rajarshi) came along and said, "I see a clear pattern =
of evolution of purity. So the last vessel does not belong. Throw it out." =
He also said that the 8th vessel was Ganga itself.<br> <br>Someone els=
e (Narasimha) came along and said, "well, vessels 3, 4, 7 and 8 are filled =
with 100% Ganga water, while vessels 5 and 6 are not. Don't conclude that a=
bout purity from the outside and look inside." He also said that no vessel =
was Ganga itself, though 4 vessels contained 100% Ganga
 water.<br> <b=

p;   *<br> <br>Let me be absolutely clear about one thing. T=
hough it may have seemed like Rajarshi was batting for Krishna and I for Ra=
ma, I do not have such divisions in my mind. Though Shiva & Shakti or s=
oul & mind play slightly different roles, I see them as two aspects of =
a single manifestation. In fact, I suggest that one cannot understand Shiva=
 tattva perfectly without also understanding Shakti tattva perfectly, and v=
ice versa. I will in fact say the same thing about Rama tattva and Krishna =
tattva.<br> <br>Also, I always like focusing on the boundaries of diff=
erences of opinion with like-minded people, to improve collective understan=
ding.<br> <br>*        *  =

nbsp;<br>Yes Rajarshi, your "case" is really
 tired from jumping all over t=

riously though, I share my thoughts with you not because my knowledge is pe=
rfect or superior, but because sharing what I see may oneday contribute tow=

of Arsha Vidya here. You are especially at the forefront of them, Rajarshi.=
