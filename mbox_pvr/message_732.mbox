Re: Regarding Maha Ganapati Homam / Re-igniting Fire
vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com
--------------------------
Namaste,
 
You are absolutely right. From God's point of view, different people have different mental conditioning and suitable for different tasks.
 
But, from our point of view, we should only look at ourselves as a servant and strive to be a more loyal servant.
 
A servant who does not care whether there is a check or cash for one million dollars or one hundred dollars in the bag, loyally considers the bag in his possession his master's property, fights to keep the bag safe despite all obstacles, irrespective of what's inside, and does not even open the bag to check what's inside, is the ideal servant that can entrusted to carry a bag containing anything.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
