Dear friends,
 
Namaste!
 
Astrologers routinely recommend remedial measures involving mantras and poojas and people spend a lot of money on them. Do they work? I will give my 2 cents of views based on my experience and insights. I will be honest, straight-forward and blunt.
 
*        *        *
 
Though believers call priests and get poojas done, in the hope that their problems will be solved, many priests today are incapable of producing any results. As a result, some believers got accustomed to accepting that a pudding exists even without eating it and remain hungry throughout life. And some intelligent people stopped believing in god and in remedies. Let me first address why this has come to be and then talk about what we should do.
 
In ancient times, caste system was not as rigid as it is today. One's varna was decided based on one's aptitude. One primarily interested in knowledge and spiritual progress would be a Brahmana. One primarily interested in power, authority and control over others would be a Kshatriya. One primarily interested in money would be a Vaisya. One primarily interested in physical pleasures would be a Shudra. One would start off with the varna of one's father, as that is what one is exposed to in childhood. However, as one's vasana (mental conditioning) blooms, one would get one's own varna. One born a Shudra like Valmiki, for example, can later turn into a Braahmana and become a Maharshi. One born a Kshatriya like Viswamitra, for example, can later turn into a Brahmana and become a Maharshi.
 
In the old days, there were true Brahmanas, who would only be interested in knowledge and spiritual progress and not caring about power, influence, money, pleasures etc. Such Brahmanas became quite pure and accumulated enough spiritual energy through continuous sadhana over years and were capable of performing very effective poojas for people.
 
Today, people who have spiritual potential may be born in non-Brahmana families and not allowed to develop fully due to the rigid caste structures. Some people born in Brahmana families may also end up getting into modern careers and not developing fully as Brahmanas. Some people may be born in Brahmana families with Kshatriya/Vaisya/Shudra tendencies and may end up becoming priests who are interested in power, authority and control over others, money and physical pleasures. Those priests who only care about knowledge and spiritual progress (i.e. true Brahmanas) are very rare. As a result, Brahmanas who have done genuine sadhana and accumulated a good amount of spiritual energy are so few.
 
*        *        *
 
If one has one million dollars in one's bank account, a check given by one for thousand dollars is meaningful. If one's bank account is empty, what good is a thousand dollar check given by one? It will bounce. Similarly, poojas done and blessings given by a priest without enough spiritual energy cannot bring one any benefits.
 
One important note: The power is not in a combination of syllables (mantra) or a sequence of physical actions (ritual). The power is in the MIND that FOCUSES on a combination of syllables (mantra) or a sequence of physical actions (ritual). Energy is generated when mind overcomes its tendency to wander and instead focuses on one thing. Different mantras and rituals as the focus points may generate different kinds of energy, but the key is focus. Without it, no mantra or ritual produces anything. Focus comes with a lot of practice. Most priests are just engaging in casual practice when they go and do poojas. In the old days, priests did intense sadhana and brought that energy to the table when they did rituals at the houses of people or in temples.
 
I did see priests who have done good sadhana, purified themselves and carry some spiritual energy. But those are getting rarer and rarer now-a-days. One can most certainly not bank on finding such a priest.
 
*        *        *
 
Given this, one is better off not depending on the priest/Brahmana class for remedies. BTW, I have nothing against the "Brahmana by birth" class, having been born in an orthodox Brahmana family myself. I have neither love nor hatred for the "Brahmana by birth" class. My only wish is that more people - from any birth caste - develop into true Brahmanas.
 
Instead of a Brahmana-by-birth who is possibly proud of his skills and thinking about money and possibly not identifying with your trouble, you can do the mantra/ritual yourself. Atleast your identification with the trouble and your desire to solve the problem will be better than the priest. If you manage to generate enough focus after practice, the mantra/ritual may actually produce some result. There is no harm in trying.
 
*        *        *
 
Many people think that poojas to gods are a serious matter and only a trained priest should do them. The procedures have evolved to become quite complicated over the time too!
 
However, complexity of rituals should never be a deterrent. Suppose rules dictate that you MUST eat 2000 calories everyday, 40 grams of protein, so many grams of vitamin A etc. Suppose you have no access to such balanced food. Will you starve yourself until you find a balanced meal or will you manage with whatever you have? If you just have a bowl of dal (lentil soup) and rice, you will simply eat it. You atleast get some energy.
 
Similarly, if you do not know the "perfect way" to do a mantra/ritual, you need not wait till you know the perfect way. You can start with what you know. It will only give you energy.
 
*        *        *
 
The fear to do rituals without "perfect knowledge" stems from the notion that some mantras/rituals can be dangerous. That notion is not totally baseless, but it is irrelevant today.
 
It is possible to focus the mind on some mantras and rituals and get specific results. When used by someone with a high level of spiritual energy, some mantras and rituals may work very fast and give specific powerful results. However, Nature has purposely hidden (almost) such things in this age.
 
I will give an analogy. A machine gun and a stick can be used to attack enemies. Stick is safe to use, but, one using a machine gun needs to be very careful. One needs to learn well, practice well and then use it, lest one should hurt oneself by accident.
 
However, suppose the house lord purposely removed ammunition from the machine gun. Then it is used just like a stick and not risky. Instead of waiting for perfect instructions on how to use the machine gun, just take it and start beating your enemies with it.
 
"Ammunition" has purposely been removed from most targeted mantras and rituals (machine guns) in this age. Instead of waiting for perfect knowledge, one can start using them right away.
 
A lot of technicalities related to mantras and rituals are irrelevant today. Mantras and rituals are to be taken up with faith, devotion and surrender to god. Whatever technicalities one can realistically follow should be followed and emphasis should be placed on devotion and surrender. If one keeps doing sadhana, eventually one's devotion and focus will improve and, for all you know, a result may come.
 
Given that we do not have perfect focus and surrender, we cannot expect specific results to come in specific counts of recitation. So we should just do the best job we can and leave the result to god, who decides when and what result should be given.
 
Bottomline is that no effort is wasted in the end. Every sincere effort generates some fruit or the other, sometime or the other!!!
 
*        *        *
 
Different mantras and rituals are like begging bowls of different shapes. They matter only so much. Depending on what kind of a begging bowl you use, you may be given different kind of alms. But it is important to start begging with some begging bowl or the other, instead of spending years looking for the perfect begging bowl.
 
Instead of waiting for astrologers with half-baked or ill-conceived knowledge to tell you the perfect mantra or ritual, do what your heart tells you or what your guru (or an elder you respect) tells you. Mantras like Gayatri mantra, Shiva panchakshari mantra, Vishnu sahasranaama stotra, Ganapathi atharva seersha, Hanuman chalisa, Bheemarupi Hanuman stotra, Vishnu's shadakshari/ashtakshari/dwadasakshari mantra, Venkateswara's ashtakshari/dwadasakshari mantra, hare krishna mantra, Chandipath (Durga saptashati), Durga saptashloki, Lalita sahasranaama stotra, Vyasa's navagraha stotra, Aditya Hridayam, Lakshmi ashtottarashatanaama stotra etc are *generic* and can work for anyone for any purpose.
 
Do not waste time looking for a perfect recommendation, perfect procedure, perfect muhurta etc and just do some sadhana or the other with a sincere heart.
 
Your effort will not go waste. Your problem may be solved or you may overcome your situation and stop worrying, or atleast your focus will improve.

In this context, I want to say a few words about homam, the sadhana of rishis.

Fire ritual is found in many ancient religions. Unlike the elements of earth, water and air, fire is ever pure and it purifies whatever it comes in contact with. The Sanskrit name for fire is paavaka, i.e.  purifier. Fire is a living god that everyone has access to. Spending time worshipping god through fire purifies one's subtle consciousness. Homam is far more effective than most other sadhanas in improving one's focus, changing one's inner personality and removing material and spiritual obstacles. One need not take my words for granted. One can try for oneself for a few months. The proof of the pudding is in eating it.
 
Vedic seers (rishis) performed homam regularly, for the benefit of the world. When composing the Jyotish masterpiece "Brihat Paaraasara Horaa Saastram" just before the advent of Kali yuga, for guidance to the people of Kali yuga, Maharshi Parasara recommended various types of homam as remedial measures for various problems in the horoscope. In fact, most remedies he recommended involve homam. Parasara asked to follow whatever procedures one was taught for starting fire and did not focus on the nitty gritty of homam. He only gave the main mantra to beused in homam. Parasara's clear teachings set to rest the notion that some people have, that homam is not for Kali yuga.
 
*        *        *

In Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna said, "yaGYaanaaM japayaGYo.asmi", i.e. I am japa among all sacrifices. Some people use this line to suggest that japam (meditation) is superior to homa/yajna. Let me put that in perspective.
 
In the line just above that line, Sri Krishna also said, "I am Om among all mantras". However, do we only meditate with the supreme mantra "Om" and leave all other mantras?
 
If one says that sitting on the pinnacle is the best part of climbing a mountain, it does not mean that the process of climbing it using various kinds of gear is useless. In fact, one needs that process to reach the pinnacle. Most cannot reach the pinnacle directly.
 
Similarly, Om is the supreme of all mantras being the source of all, but reaching the source may require using several mantras first to purify oneself. Meditating and absorbing consciousness in the Supreme (japa) may be the supreme sacrifice, but it may require purification and preparation by engaging in other kinds of sacrifices (hama/yajna).
 
When one does homam or yajna, one is engaging in external actions and one is unlikely to reach samadhi (absorbption in the Supreme). When a perfectly purified person does japam (i.e. sits still and contemplates), one may reach samadhi. However, to purify oneself, homam is far more effective.
 
*        *        *
 
Detailed manuals giving short procedures for doing various types of homam by oneself are available on the website given below. You can use the resources on that website to perform several kinds of short homam by yourself.
 
Now *hundreds* of people are performing homam by themselves either daily or weekly. Some people are also doing monthly.
 
When Manish (my spiritual guru - a small write-up on him can be read in message 3481 of vedic-wisdom yahoogroup, i.e. http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3481) told me that the Divine Mother appeared before him during Shata Chandi homam at a temple in Chennai in March 2006, directed him to spread a simplified homam ritual around the world, and showed him that hundreds of thousands of people would be performing regular homam in a few years, thus helping reverse the decay of Dharma and Truth on earth, it seemed quite far-fetched to my rational mind.
 
However, just 4 years after the Mother's command, hundreds of people are already performing regular homam. Though these are just the early days, the developments are amazing. Some of them are laymen who never even lit a lamp and did not know how to do ANY pooja or ritual. It is a miracle that such people are doing a homam everyday, like the rishis and Brahmanas of yore. I also know personally that some people doing homam for a couple of years are actually starting to experience things within and outside and, more importantly, going through rapid internal transformation.

I am neither a missionary nor a mercenary. I do not sell anything to anyone, nor do I force anything on anyone. I just freely share what I know, what I saw and what I am inspired to share. The rest is not in my hands.
 
I want to respectfully, humbly and lovingly invite those who have even an iota of interest to check out the homam website! If one gets into the habit of performing homam regularly, it has the great potential to transform one's life, materially and spiritually..
