Namaste Sir,

Doing Shani homam on Saturdays and Kuja homam on Tuesdays is =
fine.

Irrespective of one's horoscope & dasas, there is no harm in doing a=
ny planet's homam. If a planet is favorable, its indications are strengthen=
ed. If a planet is unfavorable, its indications are moderated.

Similarly, =
one can do homam of any deity that one has some attachment to (i.e. any dei=
ty for whom one can feel devotion and a sense of surrender). Irrespective o=
f one's horoscope, worship of any deity can only benefit one.

The only cav=
eat is that some benefits may require some suffering. Before you make a nic=
e ornament with gold, you need to heat it up and beat it. Before one makes =
spiritual progress, some wayward notions in mind have to be destroyed. Fier=
ce deities may be fast and furious in bringing such transformation. If one =
does not that, one is better off worshipping Ganapathi, Lakshmi, Vishnu, Sh=
iva, Krishna etc and stay away from Chandi, Bhairava etc.

It is fine to do=
 homam of a planet and then meditate with the mantra of a corresponding dei=
ty or even an unrelated deity for that matter.

Your anxiety may have had s=
everal root causes. It may be from doubts in the mind ("am I doing the righ=
t thing", "will it work", "will it cause problems" etc). It may also be due=
 to the deity deciding to take out some emotions from your mind so that you=
 can progress further.


Often these obstacles are self-feeding, i.e. the m=
ore you think of them, the bigger they become. One is better off not thinki=
ng about them. Think of God, how (s)he plays with devotees, how plays hide-=
and-seek, how prepares one for progress by possibly putting one through som=
e tests. Develop deep faith that God will finally take you across this ocea=
n.


Best regards,
Narasimha
