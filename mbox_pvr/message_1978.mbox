Dear Manoj,
 
In addition to fire, gods can be invoked in water as well as =
idols or any objects in general. In fact, gods can be invoked and worshippe=
d in one's breathing. Gods can be worshipped without any external invocatio=
n also, as they have an indwelling presence always. However, external worsh=
ip in fire gives the best results and useful for progressing for most sadha=
kas in the beginning.
 
Kurukshetra is the land of BhagavadGita and you are=
 blessed to be from that sacred land. I and my guru spent a couple of days =
at Kurukshetra for shooting a documentary movie on Krishna's historicity in=
 May 2008. That whole region is filled with some powerful and strange spiri=
tual energy. We had a couple of really nice homams and meditation sessions =
in Kurukshetra. I loved the place.
 
Particularly, one Chandi homam we did =
in the night atop a small hill in Kurukshetra (Karna ka teela) was very nic=
e. An old yogi and his grandson lived there and did sadhana everyday. They =
belonged to Naath pantha and were Gorakshaanaath (Gorakhnath) followers. Wh=
en we were climbing the hill in the afternoon, Manish told me we probably h=
ad a rina there and might end up doing something there. When we found these=
 yogis, we talked to them for a while. Just when leaving, Manish saw their =
havan kund where they do a havan everyday. Manish asked them it would be al=
right if we do Chandi homam in that havan kund that night. They welcomed us=
 under the condition that we would not call any dark energies, as they were=
 worshippers of Narayana. We told them we would call Mahalakshmi in fire an=
d they consented. We went back later that night with all materials and did =
a Chandi homam. The place had around 10 dogs. They were barking loud before=
, but they all came and sat around the homam once fire started. Surprisingl=
y, the dogs just sat around the fire without any sounds or barking for a wh=
ole 2 hours. It was Manish, I, that old naath panthaa yogi and a bunch of d=
ogs that sat around the havan kund for 2 hours.
 
Until we invoked the Moth=
er, it was very silent except for our soft voices. But the moment we invoke=
d the Mother in fire, there were strange noises all around us on the hill a=
nd in the valley. Suddenly, so many birds and flies started making various =
noises. The effect of transitioning from such silence to such an animated s=
tate all around us was quite strange and eerie. That animated state continu=
ed for a few minutes. Also, when we offered bali at the end of homam, sudde=
nly all the dogs got up and started running together towards the southweste=
rn direction while jumping up now and then, as though they were chasing som=
ebody.
 
There was no electricity there. The ONLY light in the vicinity was=
 homam fire. There were so many mosquitos all around us and biting us conti=
nuously. We did not eat anything since noon and it was 10:30 pm when we fin=
ished. Still, it was so nice. Like I said, there is something ethereal abou=
t the air of Kurukshetra. Though I only spent only a couple of days there, =
I have fond memories of that place.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

there is a water pond in almost every village the elders told us that you c=

          Namaste Ram ji,

          S=
hraaddham is an offering of balls of solid food for deceased ancestors on s=
pecial occasions.

          Pitri tarpana is an offering of water for pitr=
is (deceased ancestors who are stuck with some desires) to satisfy them. No=
t so long ago, every Braahmana used to perform a brief pitri tarpana everyd=
ay, as a part of daily rituals. This is not without reason.

          *   =
     *        *

          The thoughts of the minds around us do have a su=
btle impact on our mind. When too many depressed, sad or frustrated people =
are around you, it will have a negative effect on you. Similarly, when some=
 peaceful and blissful people or elevated souls are around you, it will hav=
e a positive effect on you. Thus, thoughts in the minds around you does hav=
e an impact on you.

          This is particularly true with respect to th=
e minds of people who have genetic/kaarmik links/debts with you. When minds=
 of such people are in great distress or great excitement, it has an impact=
 on your mind.

          If a deceased ancestor to whom you have a kaarmik=
 debt has some strong desires and unable to progress to a higher loka or be=
 reborn, his thoughts and desires will have an impact on your mind.

      =
    Thus, we invest our mental energy praying for their relief. While offer=
ing balls of solid food (shraaddha) on special occasions, pray that the anc=
estor may get an appropriate body again to fulfil remaining desires. While =
leaving water in pitri tarpana, pray that the ancestor's desires may be sat=
isfied and the ancestor may be overcome the weaknesses. By praying for help=
ing an ancestor, you are indirectly helping yourself, by removing a powerfu=
l negative influence on your mind and getting rid of some weaknesses.

    =
      Unfortunately, the extremely simple ritual of pitri tarpana is out of=
 fashion today. However, so many people will benefit tremendously if they d=
o it atleast once every month if not daily. Vimalananda says that he will p=
ick pitri tarpana if there is only one ritual he can perform.

          * =
       *        *

          Not long ago, every orthodox Braahmana used to=
 perform a fire ritual and a water ritual (tarpana) everyday. Rituals use e=
xternal symbols to induce internal changes. These two rituals are really im=
portant and useful rituals.

          A small comparison of homam and tarp=
ana is reproduced from vedic-wisdom yahoogroup archives:

          -------=
----- --------- -----
          One word on Homam vs Tarpana. In homam, you=
 are calling devatas and the medium is fire. In tarpana, you are calling pi=
tris and the medium is water. Both sadhanas are applicable to all people ir=
respective of whether watery signs/planets are strong or fiery signs/planet=
s in their horoscope.
           
          In homam, devatas come in fire =
and burn your blocking karmas to purify you. In tarpana, pitris come in wat=
er and free you from vasanas (conditioning of the mind) that were karmicall=
y inherited from them. If you have genes from (and rina with) an ancestor w=
ho was lustful or angry or jealous and the consciousness of the deceased an=
cestor is still having those thoughts, you will also suffer from such thoug=
hts due to the connection and may even commit some bad karmas because of th=
e weaknesses. You can free yourself from the rina by working on giving a re=
birth to that ancestor. If the ancestor's consciousness is attached to a ne=
w body, the thoughts and cravings of that consciousness will not affect you=
r consciousness in the same way. Thus, tarpana aims to cut off a strong sou=
rce of bad karmas, while homam burns off previously committed bad karmas. B=
oth are very important sadhanas for spiritual progress.
           
       =
   Devatas are very subtle forms of consciousness. Their self-identificatio=
n is to what is known as soul and represented by Sun. They work on your ind=
ividual soul and free it from the karmas it carries. Pitris are grosser for=
ms of consciousness with strong attachments and desires. Their self-identif=
ication is with what is known as mind and represented by Moon. You may note=
 that Sun and Moon are associated with Devas and Pitris in the hora chart o=
f astrology. Fire and water are the natural media for them respectively.
  =
         
          Devas and pitris have different ways of working and inf=
luencing us and helping our spiritual progress. But both are relevant to al=
l of us and have a role to play in our spiritual evolution. Worshipping dev=
as in fire and satisfying pitris in water are very important.

um is water. Both sadhanas are applicable

          devatas come i=

          tarpana, =
pitris come in water and free you from vasanas (conditioning 
          of =
the mind) that were karmically inherited from them. If you have 
          =
genes from (and rina with) an ancestor who was lustful or angry or 
       =
   jealous and the consciousness of the deceased ancestor is still having 
=
          those thoughts, you will also suffer from such thoughts due to th=
e 
          connection and may even commit some bad karmas because of the =

          weaknesses. You can free yourself from the rina by working on gi=

          rebirth to that ancestor. If the ancestor's consciousness=
 is attached 
          to a new body, the thoughts and cravings of that co=
nsciousness will 
          not affect your consciousness in the same way. =
Thus, tarpana aims to 
          cut off a strong source of bad karmas, whi=

          with strong attachme=

          what is known=
