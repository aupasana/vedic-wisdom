Namaste,

As Vimalananda says, dharma is indeed personal. Krishna clearly says in 
Bhagavad Geeta "Follow your own dharma. It is dangerous to follow someone 
else's dharma".

Following the path of dharma basically means engaging in the right 
action/duty. Right action varies from person to person, from time to time 
and from place to place. It is dependent on what nature expects from you, 
which in turn is based on who you have been in the past, what actions you 
did in the past while identifying with the action, who you affected in the 
past (and how) with the actions that you identified with, what debts you 
created in the process, and what mental tendencies you accumulated until 
now.

If, based on one's mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person 
to kill evil persons, that becomes one's dharma. If, based on one's mental 
tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the message of 
uniformity of all religions, that becomes one's dharma. If, based on one's 
mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the 
ritual of homam in the world, that becomes one's dharma. If, based on one's 
mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to make a lot of 
money and construct a temple, that becomes one's dharma.

*        *        *

The dharma of a being may change from one life to another.

At the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna's dharma to kill his gurus, 
elders and relatives. The time then was such that there was too much weight 
on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight. Tremendous 
destruction was to take place and civilization destroyed to a great extent, 
to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna being a great warrior, 
it was his dharma to facilitate that. Some people he deeply loved and 
respected were on the other side and it was his dharma to kill them.

When the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as one of 
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa's sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a 
previous life, according to Ramakrishna), his dharma was different in this 
new time and place. He was born to renounce material life despite his 
aristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and inspire 
generations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and service to 
others. When he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna 
said), his dharma based on the time and place may be something else.

*        *        *

The tricky question is: How does one decide what is one's dharma?

Some people have interpreted Krishna's words saying "follow your own dharma 
and not someone else's dharma" in the light of castism. Though the concept 
of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long time, the concept of 
caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by 
killing birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was a 
kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a brahmana and and a maharshi 
later. Basically varna shows one's aptitude. One starts off with the varna 
of father, because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one 
develops in life, one gets one's own varna based on what one does.

Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna's words which tells you to know your 
dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas in 
the world. Each person has individual dharma.

Knowing what one's dharma is is very very very difficult. If one is pure 
enough, one will *know* one's dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our 
mind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of 
noise from other parts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, we get 
confused.

We should make the best judgment combining discrimination and intuition and 
decide what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, but doing 
the best we can is all that we can do!

More than following dharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage in 
actions without identification. *That* alone ensures that we are not 
accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not build 
too much attachment to what we are doing. We should engage in the best 
possible actions (based on our best judgment on what our dharma in the given 
situation is), with as little attachment and self-identification with the 
action as possible. When the action is finished, we should leave the result 
to god. We should not think "I did it", "what will happen now", "will it 
work" etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through 
untached action) will simplify our ego and purify our consciousness slowly. 
As we become purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma clearer. 
There is a positive feedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our 
dharma clearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This is not easy, 
but not as difficult as people think.

The bottomline is: Even if one is not following one's dharma, one's sense of 
"this is my dharma" gets refined with time if one engages in action with 
little attachment.

*        *        *

In deciding one's dharma, one's intellect and intuition are the inputs. 
Another external input is the words of scriptures and learned men. One can 
derive one's dharma from them. A special place is given to one's spiritual 
master. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can take the words of 
the master to determine one's dharma and follow it sincerely.

When Arjuna was confused about what his dharma was and thought killing gurus 
and relatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his 
dharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dharma 
and wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do sadhana, 
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the material 
world and do the work of Mother for him.

One who is not in tune with nature and does not know who one is, what one's 
debts are and what nature expects from one can err in the judgment of what 
one's dharma is. If one's guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight into 
one's inner core, such a guru can give perfect guidance.

*        *        *

Bottomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles and 
declare that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person, from 
time to time and from place to place. Also, there are no thumbrules to find 
out what one's dharma is. But, one can refine one's understanding of one's 
dharma by increasing internal purity. By doing various kinds of spiritual 
sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and engaging in actions without much 
attachment, one can slowly purify oneself and refine one's understanding of 
one's individual dharma.

Best regards,
Narasimha
