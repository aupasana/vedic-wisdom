Namaste Vinay ji,
 
I agree that pretended sweetness is useful sometimes. I=
n fact, it can generate real sweetness through resonance over time. I did n=
ot mean to justify personal attacks, nor was I writing about a specific cas=
e at all. I was writing in general about gentle attitude vs aggressive atti=
tude in the context of dharma. Yes, intellectual opposition can be expresse=
d firmly and yet impersonally. Personal attacks are usually bad and purpose=
less. They can be dharmik only when a very adharmik person needs to be torn=
 down to pieces as he is spreading adharma in the world.
 
Narasimha was fe=
rocious because he had to kill Hiranyakashipu, who desired physical immorta=
lity and invincibility and nearly got it. In the absence of Hiranyakashipu,=
 that ferociousness is not need. 
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
