Namaste Rahul and others,
 
We all have some fire within us. When we channe=
l it properly, we fulfil our dharma successfully. When the fire is unchanne=
led and beset with impurities, we waste energy and fail to fulfil our dharm=
a.
 
Fire in conjunction with sattwa guna generates knowledge (jnaana shakt=
i). Fire in conjunction with rajo guna generates actions (kriyaa shakti). F=
ire in conjunction with tamo guna generates desires (ichchhaa shakti). We n=
eed people who mainly have sattwa and also some rajas. Such people have cle=
ar thinking backed by correct knowledge and engage in fruitful actions. It =
is more important to engage in a few fruitful actions than to engage in too=
 many mis-directed actions and be left with unfulfilled desires and frustra=
tion, which is what happens when there is too much tamas and rajas. There a=
re many self-styled "Hindutva" warriors today who fall in the latter catego=
ry. They yell from rooftops in shrill voices, but do not accomplish much. D=
o we need some more such people?
 
*        *        *
 
What Hindutva need=
s today is a few detached Arjunas who destroy mighty armies without hatred =
for anyone in their heart. What Hindutva needs today is a few detached Vive=
kanandas who inspire millions with their magnetic personality without any p=
assion in their heart.
 
Act like a passionate man, but have no passion in =
your heart. Fight unwaveringly, but have no hatred for anyone.
 
If one is =
fighting a war with passion, frustration or hatred in one's heart, one will=
 only go so far and achieve only so much. What such a person achieves will =
be short-lived. If one first overcomes attractions and repulsions, has a st=
able and unperturbed heart without passion and hatred and becomes a detache=
d instrument of Nature engaging in spontaneous actions without any attachme=
nt, one will achieve much more and what one achieves will be long-lived.
 
=
I am writing this to this group of people because my intuition tells me tha=
t there are some on this group who have the potential to become such instru=
ments of Mother.
 
Do some spiritual sadhana first and overcome the weaknes=
ses. Have a stable, unperturbed and equanimous heart. Then Nature will show=
 you the way.
 
*        *        *
 
Ceturies ago, western invaders went a=
bout their business with great dexterity and patience to affect the psyche =
of Hindus, especially intelligentsia. Their slow, patient, dexterous and sy=
stematic propaganda is bearing fruit even today. To undo their work, one ne=
eds to be equally dexterous and patient. This is not the work for hot-blood=
ed, angry and frustrated people. One needs to be cool-headed, smart and pat=
ient.
 
Another thing is that sanatana dharma is broken today. In pursuit o=
f modern education, the cream of Indian intelligentsia stopped engaging in =
our traditional knowledge. This brought a discontinuity in knowledge. We ha=
ve some faithful Hindus engaging in superstitious and/or purposeless practi=
ces. We have many priests who are corrupted by money and fame, don't do any=
 sadhana and don't have any spiritual strength. Many intelligent people eit=
her dissociate themselves from religion or follow religion passively withou=
t much faith and with some shame or misgivings. At the root of this is the =
broken knowledge and purposeless practices.
 
Also, we have many bad practi=
ces that afflict Hinduism due to Kali, which need to be gotten rid of. For =
example, caste system of today is so different from old days. The concept o=
f caste mobility is gone now - one would start with father's caste, but get=
 a caste later on based on one's aptitude and attitude in old days. For exa=
mple, Valmiki was a shudra by birth who lived by killing birds and he becam=
e a brahmana and a brahmarshi later. Vishwamitra was a kshatriya by birth b=
ut became a brahmana and a brahmarshi later and even became one of saptarsh=
is. If lower caste and untouchable Hindus feel aversion to Hinduism which i=
s exploted by Christian missionaries who offer money and respect to convert=
, some fault lies with Hinduism too. We need to reform casteism.
 
There ar=
e many things that need to be done. At one level, some propaganda needs to =
be done on the greatness of Hinduism. This needs to be done with a cool, sc=
holarly and patient attitude (as opposed to yelling in shrill voice from ro=
oftops like some Hindutva activists foolishly do). At another level, broken=
 links within Hinduism need to be rediscovered so that the knowledgebase of=
 our philosophy is correctly represented to sway the intelligentsia. While =
other religions are based on "faith" in the words of a messiah, Hinduism ha=
s a wide-ranging and sophisticated philosophy and methods that can enable a=
nyone to become a messiah. However, the knowledge has become corrupted and =
incomplete and some intelligent people are justified in not having faith. A=
t yet another level, we need to reform some social and cultural aspects of =
Hindusm and undo some changes brought in by Kali.
 
There are many things t=
o do and this will take many decades of focused and concerted effort.
 
*  =
      *        *
 
Personally, I have no doubt that the time of weakening (=
or even fall) of certain faiths has come. In the next few decades, some fai=
ths will be weakened considerably and sanatana dharma will be strengthened.=
 However, this being Kali yuga, such a change will not be permanent.
 
Best=
 regards,
Narasimha

  Every minute that we lo=

referring to the angst and voice from within.


  Hindutv and sanatan dharm=
 has never fought or converted or held crusades, yet today, we find ourselv=
es as onlookers and commentators to our own destruction, embroiled in mater=

 undoing 2000 years of blasphemy and try to live in a world where - to each=
 is own - and poverty, misery and torture in the name of cannibalistic capi=
talism or socialism or even communism for that matter, is abhored on earth.=
.


  With ved and the knowledge of their existence , their meaning and the=
 realization of the presence of divinity, comes responsibility. We must sha=

of being who they are for their faith. We must lead the way because we know=



  Guruji, you should help empower us to challenge the person in the mirr=

    Subject: Conversion-God's wor=
k -Sr Mary Prema Superior of the MoCThe new Superior General of the Mission=
aries of Charity (MoC)Sr.Mary Prema made two revelations-that religious con=
version-'is God's work. That-if she received divine inspiration she would g=
o to Kandhamal.The first one of describing conversions as God's work is the=
 usual clich=E9 which comes handy to all those involved in conversion. Conv=
ersion is to Christianity what Jehad is to Islam. Sr Prema further explaine=
d that, 'Every human being has the right to believe. Each person is born wi=
th dignity. Religious conversion is God's work'. The contradictions galore =
within the two sentences are glaring. If every person has the right to beli=
eve then where is the need to initiate that person to something new and str=
ange and in something in which that person is not born in? Should one god b=
e exorcised out of the person and another god be installed to uphold the di=
gnity with which this person was born with?This is actually what conversion=
 is all about. Why this rupturing of the person from what he/she was .So wh=
at Sr Prema really means is that every person has a right to be converted a=
nd hence the right of the person to believe is conditioned  and restrictedt=
o only believing in the god in whom Sr Prema and her whole church believes =
in. This is what Sr Prema articulated when she so naively asserted that eve=
ry person has a right to believe and every person is born with dignity. Tha=
t this god is only 2000 years old and somehow seems to be always in the com=
pany of those who invade the land of others is another dimension which need=
s a longer treatise.

    If conversion is God's work then whose work is re=
-conversion?  Sr Prema-the Superior General of the MoC and the whole armies=
 of Christian missionaries involved in conversion has failed this god miser=
ably-because their god has failed them. If conversion is God's work he seem=
s to be rather slow and inefficient. The Catholic Church has the biggest ar=
my of nuns and priests and the Christian evangelical churches have their ow=
n brand of evangelists, the Southern Baptists alone as a group has nearly 1=
00,00 career missionaries in North India. Yet this God seem to be hardly ha=
ving an impact. This god also seem to be scared-does not direct their effor=
ts to the Islamic countries. Is He afraid of terrorists?It is the simple un=
armed, poverty stricken tribals and passive Hindus that this God and his di=
vine inspired missionaries  target at . And yet not so easy given the enorm=
ous funds that flow and the armies at the disposal of this god he had to gi=
ve divine
    inspiration to a Christian agency to massacre an unarmed poor=
 swamiji whom he found a great hurdle to spread his kingdom.
    Sr Prema h=
as unwittingly exposed the bluff of the Congress and the UPA leaders. We ar=
e told that conversion is not taking place. Conversion takes different form=
s-globally, it is  disguised as a military coup, violence and very often a =
deception of service and development is the sheen given to this violent con=
version. Yes conversion is violence wrought on a person-to deprive the pers=
on of his/her dignity which according to Sr Prema every person is born with=
-to tear the person off his affinity, his religious heritage and made him/h=
er an alien is a psychological bleeding to death. Christianity and conversi=
on are two sides of the same coin. Where ever Christianity went it was bloo=
dshed-destruction, and a hidden agenda of political power, economic aggrand=
izement, and pauperization of the victims. In the words of the Kenyatta (th=
e Kenyan freedom fighter) 'when the missionaries came they had the Bible an=
d we had the land. They said, 'Let us pray,' We
    closed our eyes, when w=
e opened them, they had our lands and we had the Bible'. This is true not o=
nly in Africa but all over the globe. Those countries which broke away from=
 the stranglehold of Vatican became progressive-like Canada, Australia, Eng=
land but those colonized by the catholic powers like Spain, Portugal Mexico=
, Argentina, Cuba, Italy are mired in military rule and church tyranny. Chr=
istianity today likes to be seen as a peace loving, compassionate religion =
of brotherhood. But far from it-the religion was born in blood and grew in =
bloodshed. Economic and political powers are its hidden agenda covered with=
 service organizations, education institutions etc.
    May be Sr Prema is =
too na=EFve to understand and she as all nuns and priests are ignorant of c=
hurch history. These nuns and priests are brainwashed into this service and=
 love of the poor mission.Many soon realize but then it is too late for the=
m especially in India to be courageous to act and pull out. They become lik=
e voices in the wilderness and the church is too powerful an organization t=
o fight against by ordinary innocent and truthful persons.
    This brings =
me to Sr Prema's pious wish-that she would visit Kandhamal if she receives =
'divine inspiration' and she would definitely intervene. One wonder what in=
tervention is she talking about-intervene for whom and with whom? Sr Prema =
would do a greater service if she visited the ex nun Jesme in Kerala and li=
stened to her tale of sexual harassment within the convent-how she was betr=
ayed by her own and even had to submit herself to priests to be stripped na=
ked. This is nothing new. and not a singular case but happenings that have =
been on for ages-these sexual escapades -including rape and murder have bee=
n happenings within the confines of the convents and the church compound .O=
nly when a nun is raped outside these confines then all hell breaks loose. =
Sr Prema could direct her divine inspired mission to empathize with Sr Jesm=
y and many like her and intervene with the church authorities .Sr Prema the=
 Superior General of the MoC should be aware
    that nuns are on contracep=
tives, nuns have begotten children of bishops and priests-whole dioceses ha=
ve been sold in the USA to pay the compensation for the sexual violation on=
 alter boys by priests. A Jesuit province in the USA has declared itself in=
solvent because it cannot garner the huge funds to pay the compensation to =
the sexual victims by its perpetrators-the priests. Be it in India or in ot=
her parts of the world all this pales into nothing-only Kandhamal occupies =
and covers the whole vision of the pious Christians and Sr Prema is no exce=
ption.  I suggest that she first visit the Ashram of Swami Lakshmanada and =
soothe the terror stricken children in whose presence the 84 year Swamiji w=
as brutally butchered. Three nuns who were with him were also killed. Will =
Sr Prema intervene with those murderers and see that justice is done? One l=
ast request Sr Prema and her MoC work for the poor she asaserts-then why sh=
ould the money meant for the  poor of
    this country find its way to the =
confers of Rome? It is very difficult to divest conversion and money. Are t=
he accounts of the MoC being audited? If not why? Why should the lands and =
the church properties be exempted from tax and auditing? This is something =
anti-national .Money cannot change its value simply because it is held in t=
he hands of a particular community-All monies must be accounted for. Is it =
not strange that those working in Minority Education institutions and drawi=
ng the UGC pay scales are Income tax assesses but the priests and the nuns =
working in the same institutions are exempted from paying Income tax. They =
too draw the same salaries-if not more for less work-they too hold individu=
al bank accounts and they too draw their pensions till their death-all from=
 the taxpayers monies. Why should they be exempted from paying the Income t=
ax? This is just one area to show that the workings of the poor of which Sr=
 Prema and all missionaries are
    engaged and other service organizations=
 are a big money spinning business. A special vocabulary must be coded to u=
nderstand the language of the Christians. Power is sugar coated and called =
service. Forgiveness is easily extended to those who hurt them-to show how =
compassionate they are. But they refuse to stop hurting others-they refuse =
to stop dehumanizing the tribals and the poor. Why don't they leave the poo=
r alone? If in spite of  the enormous funds which have flowed and are flowi=
ng  from abroad combined with  the government's Five Year Plans and a globa=
lly  powerful God by  their side the missionaries are not able to diminish =
 poverty, to reduce hunger and assetlessness, then is it not time to pause =
take stock of  what is fundamentally wrong? Who is swindling whom? Why are =
the poor kept in poverty? Why should the poor continue to be poor, why shou=
ld backwardness be ever growing? Account for the work that has been so far =
carried on and stop the
    pauperization and the plunder of this country a=
nd its poor. Should we wait for Sr Prema and the likes of her for divine in=
spiration to be just logical and sensible? 
    Tailpiece-
    Even the Pop=
e has lost his ability to pray that he has now assigned the Archbishop of G=
awhati to script prayers for him! The Catholic Church needs prayer scripter=
s- for it is unable to turn the hearts and souls of its followers to that s=
pirit within themselves and seek redemption and justice.

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Ceturies ago, western invaders=
 went about their

us and systematic

equally dexterous and patient. This is not the wo=

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2> =
</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Another thing is that sanata=

today. In pursuit of modern education, the cream of In=
dian intelligentsia 
stopped engaging in our traditional knowledge. This br=
ought a discontinuity in 
knowledge. We have some faithful Hindus engaging =
in superstitious and/or 
purposeless practices. We have many priests who ar=
e corrupted by money and fame, 
don't do any sadhana and don't have any spi=
ritual strength. Many intelligent 
people either dissociate themselves from=
 religion or follow religion passively 
without much faith and with some sh=

broken knowledge and purpose=
less practices.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2> </FONT>=
</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Also, we have many bad practices th=
at afflict 
Hinduism due to Kali, which need to be gotten rid of. For examp=
le, caste system 
of today is so different from old days. The concept of ca=
ste mobility is gone 
now - one would start with father's caste, but g=
et a caste later on based 
on one's aptitude and attitude in old days. For =
example, Valmiki was a shudra by 
birth who lived by killing birds and he b=
ecame a brahmana and a brahmarshi 
later. Vishwamitra was a kshatriya by bi=
rth but became a brahmana and a 
brahmarshi later and even became one of sa=
ptarshis. If lower caste and 
untouchable Hindus feel aversion to Hind=
uism which is exploted by Christian 
missionaries who offer money and respe=
ct to convert, <EM>some</EM> fault lies 
with Hinduism too. We need to refo=
rm casteism.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2> </FONT></D=
IV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>There are many things that need to be =
done. At one 
level, some propaganda needs to be done on the greatness of H=
induism. This needs 
to be done with a cool, scholarly and patient att=
itude (as opposed to 
yelling in shrill voice from rooftops like some Hindu=
tva activists foolishly 
do). At another level, broken links within Hinduis=
m need to be rediscovered so 
that the knowledgebase of our philosophy is c=
orrectly represented to sway the 
intelligentsia. While other religions are=
 based on "faith" in the words of a 
messiah, Hinduism has a wide-ranging a=

that can enable <EM>anyone </EM>to=
 <EM>become</EM> a messiah. However, the 
knowledge has become corrupted an=

of the Congress and the UPA leaders. We

    forms-globally, it is =
 disguised as a military coup, violence and very

service and development is the sheen given to this 
    violent conversion.=
 Yes conversion is violence wrought on a person-to

of his/her dignity which according to Sr Prema every

    Christianity =
and conversion are two sides of the same coin. Where ever 
    Christianity=
 went it was bloodshed-destruction, and a hidden agenda of 
    political p=

    In th=

 the globe. 
    Those countries which broke away from the stranglehold of =

    progressive-like Canada, Australia, England but those c=

 Sr Prema is too na=EFve to understand

    pious wis=

    intervention i=

    would d=
o a greater service if she visited the ex nun Jesme in Kerala and 
    list=

    b=
etrayed by her own and even had to submit herself to priests to be stripped=
 
    naked. This is nothing new. and not a singular case but happenings th=

murder have been 
    happenings within the confines of the convents and th=

    when a nun is raped outside these confines the=

    Kandhamal occupies a=

    Sr Prema is no =

    Swami La=
kshmanada and soothe the terror stricken children in whose presence 
    th=

   =
 were also killed. Will Sr Prema intervene with those murderers and see tha=
t 
    justice is done? One last request Sr Prema and her MoC work for the =
poor she 
    asaserts-then why should the money meant for the  poor o=
f<BR>this 
    country find its way to the confers of Rome? It is very diff=
icult to divest 
    conversion and money. Are the accounts of the MoC bein=

    Why should the lands and the church properties =

    auditing? This is something anti-national .Mo=

    for less work-they too =
hold individual bank accounts and they too draw their 
    pensions till th=
eir death-all from the taxpayers monies. Why should they be 
    exempted f=
rom paying the Income tax? This is just one area to show that the 
    work=

   =
 and other service organizations are a big money spinning business. A speci=
