Namaste,
=C2=A0
It sounds to me like vata is highly deranged, resulting in =
great fear/anxiety that gets triggered by some cues. Some precautions at th=
e physical level can augment spiritual practice. If possible, see a good ay=
urvedic practitioner. Though western medicine will give some "XYZ syndrome"=
 name to these physio-mental conditions and give medicines, it often addres=
ses only the superficial symptoms and lets the rootcause fester and even ge=
t worse. Ayurveda can be helpful.
=C2=A0
Also, read up on the internet abou=
t vata pacifying foods and eat grains, legumes (dals), vegetables, fruits, =
spices etc that do not aggravate vata. For example, if you eat only salad f=
or a few days, your fearful condition may get much worse. If you eat fully =
cooked & soft vegetables with mildly spiced gravy, it may get better. And s=
o on. Follow basic ayurvedic guidelines for a while.
=C2=A0
One more thing =
that may help is to not flow in that emotion when the emotion (e.g. fear or=
 anxiety or anger) hits you. Once you are aware of that emotion, think that=
 it is goddess who manifests in your mind as that emotion. The all powerful=
 goddess manifests as happiness, sadness, ability, weakness, fear, bravery,=
 pride, humility etc. Think of Her and think of how She manifests as variou=
s emotions and sensations in our consciousness based on our conditioning an=
d fructification of our karmas. This may not solve the problem, but it expa=
nds your mind's focus/pre-occupation from one specific emotion to a broader=
 topic and can anchor it back to god.

=C2=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha
