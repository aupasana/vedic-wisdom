Namaste,

By visualization, I not only mean the image or form one may imagine, but 
also one's notion of who that deity is, what the deity stands for, what 
the deity gives and what one wants.

Read the portion I highlighted in 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/6895 from the 
interview with Chandrashekara Bharathi Swamigal. As he shows, different 
people who like him have different notions of who he is and like *that 
notion*. Similarly, different people worshipping a specific form of 
"Kali" with a specific mantra may have different notions of who that 
deity is and end up worshipping *that notion*. Accordingly, what they 
experience is different.

Best regards,
Narasimha
