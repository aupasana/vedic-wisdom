Namaste,
 
It is perfectly fine to combine the sadhanas of different aspect=
s of the Mother, including Lalita and Chandi.
 
Sri Vidya consists of symbo=
lic practices that eventually enable one to understand various layers of Ma=
ayaa surrounding true Self. The idea is that one is not bound by Maayaa onc=
e one *fully* understands and appreciates it.
 
Chandipath consists of symb=
olic stories of wars that the divine Mother fought, which explain how one c=
an fight and overcome various weaknesses that typically bind one in Maayaa.=
 Reciting these stories on a regular basis will promote the fighting spirit=
 within one that fights these weaknesses.
 
There is nothing wrong in under=
standing Maayaa and trying to fight/overcome it at the same time. One aspec=
t of the Mother creates Maayaa. One aspect of the Mother makes you experien=
ce good and bad in that Maayaa. One aspect of the Mother makes you understa=
nd Maayaa to overcome it. One aspect of the Mother makes you fight and over=
come it. When one realizes Self at the end, irrespective of the path taken,=
 one finally sees that all these are aspects of a Single Mother who is also=
 essentially true Self.

Aghora seri=
es books by Svoboda are good, but Aghora is not everyone's cup of tea. It i=
s normal to have mixed feelings.
 
Ghora means terrible. Aghora means "not =
terrible". One of the names of Lord Shiva is Aghora. A true Aghora (aghori)=
 does not see anything as terrible or bad or impure and sees all as imperma=
nent manifestations of god and tries to focus the thinking of the mind on w=
hat is permanent (god) always, instead of impermanent manifestations of god=
.
 
When someone dies, north Indians chant "Raama naam satya hai" while car=
rying the dead body to the funeral. It means "only the name of Lord Rama is=
 true and everything else is an illusion". The idea is to remind oneself th=
at life and death are just a temporary illusion and only the Lord is real. =
But the question is: why should we remind ourselves of this ultimate truth =
only when someone dies? When someone praises us for a supposedly great thin=
g we have done and we are about to feel proud and happy, can't we tell ours=
elves "Raama naam satya hai. This thing we did and the praises are temporar=
y illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary ill=
usions"? When we feel attracted to something beautiful and want to get it, =
can't we tell ourselves "Raama naam satya hai. This thing that seems beauti=
ful and other things that seem not so beautiful are temporary illusions. On=
ly the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusions"? When s=
omeone attacks and abuses us and we are about to feel sad or angry, can't w=
e tell ourselves "Raama naam satya hai. These abuses are temporary illusion=
s. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusions"?"
=
 
A true Aghora's mind thinks "Raama naam satya hai" always. His mind rejec=
ts all *impermanent manifestations* of Lord (instead of *dwelling* on them =
by classifying them as pure and impure, good and bad etc and thinking about=
 them with attraction/aversion) and tries to find and focus on what is perm=
anent. But he takes it to extremes.
 
*        *        *
 
Vedanta says "a=
ll is Self. The variety we perceive is an illusion". An aghora pursues it p=
ractically. If feces and fruit are both impermenant illusions and the only =
permanent reality within them is the Self, he questions why he can eat frui=
t but not feces. So he may try a ritual where feces is eaten. But, please r=
emember that eating feces is not the main point. Perceiving Self in the foo=
d being consumed and not perceiving an impermanent manifestation of Self (f=
eces, fruit etc), is the main point. For example, eating feces with disgust=
 serves no purpose, for such a person's mind is dwelling on the impermenant=
 manifestation of Self ("feces") while eating it. A successful Aghora may b=
e eating feces, but the mind will not be dwelling on the fact that he is ea=
ting "feces" with certain properties and will not feel any kind of disgust.=
 He will be thinking that he is Self and he is eating Self.
 
Of course, a =
vedantin also has the same notions really. He chants vedic verses when eati=
ng food, which essentially mean "I am Self and I am consuming Self". Nevert=
heless, such chanting may merely be a ritual and not be fully absorbed in o=
ne's thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on the impermanant manifestat=
ions of Self ("a tasty laddu", "a badly cooked brinjal curry", "a overly sa=
lty cracker" etc) and waver from the focus on the permanent (Self).
 
Thus,=
 a vedantin and an aghora are telling themselves the same truth and trying =
to absorb that truth into every thought and impulse. But aghora is putting =
himself in an extreme situation where failure results in a very bad dual ex=
perience. That can in fact work as an incentive in forcing one to transcend=
 duality! In the case of a person who chants a Vedic verse that says "I am =
Self and I am consuming Self" and eats tasty laddus and nicely made food, t=
he fallout from failing to absorb the mind in Self while eating is not too =
bad. If the mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice) taste of a laddu =
or other food, what is the big deal? On the other hand, if the mind fails t=
o absorb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it will be so disgusting=
. Thus, the fact that failure results in a very bad dual experience may act=
 as an incentive in succeeding quickly.
 
However, difficult tasks cannot n=
ecessarily be accomplished by everyone merely because of an incentive. Not =
everyone trying Aghora sadhanas succeeds.
 
*        *        *
 
Take anot=
her simple example. Suppose someone is doing a lot of sadhana, like japam a=
nd homam, and yet having a weakness for sex. Suppose one's mind is dwelling=
 on sex or getting sexual thoughts in the middle of sadhana and that is cau=
sing guilt and blocking one's sadhana.
 
A regular person will try to enfor=
ce celibacy and keep the mind away from sexual thoughts. But that is nor a =
formula for overcoming such thoughts. After all, such thoughts may still co=
me and distract one. Even if one keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is no g=
uarantee that the fascination in the mind does not return to bite one after=
 that. But, how to overcome the fascination some minds may have for sex?
 
=
An aghora will take it to an extreme. He will try to fix the root cause and=
 remove fascination from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and sex as tw=
o different activities (one pure and the other impure), he may combine them=
 into one without such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an aghora si=
ts naked with his partner sitting naked on his lap and then does his japam.=
 In the beginning, this may titillate and result in sex. He may think that =
his sadhana is being made impure. But, suppose he persists to do japam like=
 that for several months/years. Eventually, mind may be reprogrammed. He ma=
y no longer feel that he is doing something impure. He may no longer feel t=
itillation. The association in his mind between nakedness and sex may be br=
oken down. Seeing naked pictures physically or mentally may no longer evoke=
 thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of meditation. Any small thoughts rela=
ted to sex that suddenly rise in the head may not lead to denser and denser=
 thoughts relating to sex and distraction in sadhana, but they may now take=
 the mind back to meditation. After spending so much time in meditation whi=
le sitting naked intimately, the attraction and thrill mind may feel for na=
kedness or intimacy may be broken down. Overall, the person's fascination a=
nd weakness for sex may be gone largely.
 
Mind has a lot of conditioning b=
ased on prior experiences and the thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora someti=
mes tries to break down some of these structures by engaging in certain pra=
ctices that undermine those structures.
 
However, is this a fool-proof met=
hod? Not really. It is also possible that the person keeps on engaging in t=
he practice merely for sex and thinks of sex everytime he sits for meditati=
on (instead of thinking of meditation everytime he sees naked partner), if =
one was not serious/sincere/ready to start with.
 
*        *        *
 
Bo=
ttomline is that an aghora takes problems and weaknesses head on and sets u=
p a high stakes fight with them, whereas a normal person may push the probl=
ems under the carpet and fight slowly and with low stakes. Such a risky str=
ategy is not applicable to all.
 
*        *        *
 
Like Manish said in=
 a mail earlier, "what is Vedanta and what is Aghora"? Aghora is merely a p=
ractical way to understand and absorb Vedanta in one's thought process, by =
setting up a high stakes war plan. However, it is certainly not suitable fo=
r all and many may feel aversion. More dangerously, some people may feel at=
traction for it based on a wrong understanding and the thrill such an under=
standing brings. Aghora stands for neither thrills nor perversion, though i=
t *may* attract some people pursuing thrills and/or perversion. The basic t=
enets of Aghora and Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, but Aghora tries to ac=
celerates how one absorbs the truth into one's thinking by making failure v=
ery unpleasant.
 
BTW, the following mail gives a good analogy for various =
spiritual paths and explains the basic reality. It may be interesting to re=
ad in the context of aghora.

Dear Narasimhagaru,

        Thank you for your reply. 

        I understa=
nd that Chandi and Lalita are two different forms of the Universal Mother. =
But what I am trying to understand is that how to worship both forms simult=
aneously. For instance, Sri Muththuswamy Diskshitar, was a great composer (=
one of the Divine Trinity of Carnatic Music along with Thyagaraja and Shyam=
a Sastry), who was a self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka. His Kamalamba Navavarna=
 Krithis mention great details about all the nine avaranas and different fo=
rms of the divine mother as one goes through each avarana. In the Dhyana Kr=
ithi of those, in the very first line he says, 'Kamalambike, AsRta kalpalat=
ike, ChanDike'. That line tells me that even through Sri Vidya one can wors=
hip Chandi Ma, in that form. 

        So my question was in that perspecti=
ve. Anyway, your reply was a great one in which you mentioned how the Self =
is surrounded by layers of duality! I never thought in those terms. 

     =
   I have started reading Durga Saptashati, just to get practise of reading=
 it fluently, before I start to do chandi homam, which I plan to do during =
navaratri of 2010. I really cannot wait to get comfortable reading the sapt=
ashati! Have to see how mother will help me achieve my target. 

        Al=
so, I have started to read the Aghora series books by Dr. Robert Svobodha. =
For now I have very mixed feelings on the subject. Perhaps I need to read m=
ore!

          Namaste,

          Sanskrit is almost li=
ke a mother tongue to me. My performing a Chandi homam everyday should hard=
ly be awe-inspiring. On the other hand, there are some people who do not kn=
ow Sanskrit at all and took 4 hours to read Chandipath with great difficult=
y in their first attempt. THEY are doing Chandi homam everyday and it takes=
 them 1.5 hours now. THAT is awe-inspiring.

          Integrating various =
sadhanas is a personal problem that needs a personal solution. In general, =
it is a good idea to pick one or two sadhanas and maximize the time spent o=
n them, instead of splitting the time between ten things. As Ramakrishna Pa=
ramahamsa said, it is better to dig 10 metres in one place rather than dig =
one metre in ten places, if one wants to find water.

          One possibi=
lity is to do a homam and then meditate at the end after poornaahuti with v=
arious mantras one is attached to.

          I am not that knowledgeable a=
bout Sri Vidya. However, from the little I have been exposed to, Sree chakr=
a is a symblic representation of the layers of duality surrounding Self. It=
s purpose, too, is to unravel the layer of duality and realize Self.

     =
     Lalita means gentle one and Chandi means the fierce one. If you have a=
 mother who teaches you gently, you will learn slowly. If you have a mother=
 who is stern and strict, you will learn fast (provided you can face the st=
rictness). Both are valid paths.

          Dear Sri Narasimharao garu,
=

          I am very much in awe after I learnt that you do chandi homam ev=
eryday. You also wrote that it takes about 1.25 hours to 1.5 hours to do yo=
ur chandi homam. How can you accomplish that feat with 700 ahutis in such a=
 short time? Also, in my case, I do sandhyavandanam with 108 Gayatri (20 mi=
nutes)+ganapathi mantra japam 108 times(10 minutes), a short rudra Abhishek=
am with pachakshari, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 minutes) totalling to about =
35 - 40 minutes daily ritual. Plus I sometimes do special rituals several t=
imes a week, that takes about 1 to 1.5 hours in all. How to integrate these=
 along with homam? Is Sri vidyopasana different from Chandi homam? Could yo=
u please explain what is sri Vidya and how it is to be learnt? I am very mo=
tivated to learn what the Devi Mahatmayam is all about but I also have keen=
 interest in Sri Vidya, because I am a musician also and learnt all the nav=
a-avarna krithis of Great Muththuswami Dikshitar recently.

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial siz=
e=3D2>Vedanta says "all is Self. The variety we perceive 
is an illusion". =
An aghora pursues it practically. If feces and fruit are both 
impermenant =
illusions and the only permanent reality within them is the Self, he 
quest=
ions why he can eat fruit but not feces. So he may try a ritual where feces=
 
is eaten. </FONT><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>But, please remember th=
at eating 
feces is not the main point. Perceiving Self in the food being c=
onsumed and not 
perceiving an impermanent manifestation of Self (feces, fr=
uit etc), is the main 
point. For example, eating feces with disgust serves=
 no purpose, for such a 
person's mind is dwelling on the impermenant manif=
estation of Self ("feces") 
while eating it. A successful Aghora may be eat=
ing feces, but the mind will not 
be dwelling on the fact that he is eating=
 "feces" with certain properties and 
will not feel any kind of disgust. He=
 will be thinking that he is Self and he is 
eating Self.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV=
><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial si=
ze=3D2>Of course, a vedantin also has the same notions 
really. He chants v=
edic verses when eating food, which essentially mean "I am 
Self and I am c=
onsuming Self". Nevertheless, such chanting may merely be a 
ritual and not=
 be fully absorbed in one's thinking. As he eats, his mind may 
dwell on th=
e impermanant manifestations of Self ("a tasty laddu", "a badly 
cooked bri=
njal curry", "a overly salty cracker" etc) and waver from the focus on 
the=
 permanent (Self).</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2> </FO=

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Thus, a vedantin and an aghora a=
re telling 
themselves the same truth and trying to absorb that truth into =
every thought and 
impulse. But aghora is putting himself in an extreme sit=
uation where failure 
results in a very bad dual experience. That can in fa=
ct work as an incentive in 
forcing one to transcend duality! In the case o=
f a person who chants a Vedic 
verse that says "I am Self and I am consumin=
g Self" and eats tasty laddus and 
nicely made food, the fallout from faili=
ng to absorb the mind in Self while 
eating is not too bad. If the mind dwe=
lls on the nice (or even not-so-nice) 
taste of a laddu or other food, what=
 is the big deal? On the other hand, if the 
mind fails to absorb in Self a=
nd dwells on the taste of feces, it will be so 
disgusting. Thus, the fact =
that failure results in a very bad dual experience 
may act as an incentive=
 in succeeding quickly.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV>Take another simple example. Suppose someone is doing a lot of sa=
dhana, 
like japam and homam, and yet having a weakness for sex. Suppose on=
e's mind is 
dwelling on sex or getting sexual thoughts in the middle of sa=
dhana and that is 
causing guilt and blocking one's sadhana.</DIV>
<DIV>&nb=
sp;</DIV>
<DIV>A regular person will try to enforce celibacy and keep the m=
ind away from 
sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula for overcoming su=
ch thoughts. After 
all, such thoughts may still come and distract one. Eve=
n if one keeps celibacy 
for 10 years, there is no guarantee that the fasci=
nation in the mind does not 
return to bite one after that. But, how to ove=
rcome the fascination some minds 
may have for sex?</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>=

<DIV>An aghora will take it to an extreme. He will try to fix the root cau=
se and 
remove fascination from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and se=
x as two 
different activities (one pure and the other impure), he may comb=
ine them into 
one without such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an =
aghora sits naked 
with his partner sitting naked on his lap and then does =
his japam. In the 
beginning, this may titillate and result in sex. He may =
think that his sadhana 
is being made impure. But, suppose he persists to d=
o japam like that for several 
months/years. Eventually, mind may be reprog=
rammed. He may no longer feel that 
he is doing something impure. He may no=
 longer feel titillation. The association 
in his mind between nakedness an=
d sex may be broken down. Seeing naked pictures 
physically or mentally may=
 no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts 
of meditation. Any sm=
all thoughts related to sex that suddenly rise in the head 
may not lead to=
 denser and denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in 
sadhana, bu=
t they may now take the mind back to meditation. After spending so 
much ti=
me in meditation while sitting naked intimately, the attraction and 
thrill=
 mind may feel for nakedness or intimacy may be broken down. Overall, the 
=
person's fascination and weakness for sex may be gone largely.</DIV>
<DIV>&=
nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Mind has a lot of conditioning based on prior experiences =
and the thoughts 
we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break down s=
ome of these structures 
by engaging in certain practices that undermine th=
ose structures.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>However, is this a fool-proof =
method? Not really. It is also possible that 
the person keeps on engaging =
in the practice merely for sex and thinks of sex 
everytime he sits for med=
itation (instead of thinking of meditation everytime he 
sees naked partner=
), if one was not serious/sincere/ready to start with.</DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>*     &=

<DI=
V> </DIV>Bottomline is that an aghora takes problems and weaknesses he=
ad 
on and sets up a high stakes fight with them, whereas a normal person m=
ay push 
the problems under the carpet and fight slowly and with low stakes=
. Such a risky 
strategy is not applicable to all.</DIV>

<DIV> </DIV>Like Manish said in a mail ear=
lier, "what is Vedanta and what 
is Aghora"? Aghora is merely a practical w=
ay to understand and absorb Vedanta in 
one's thought process, by setting u=
p a high stakes war plan. However, it is 
certainly not suitable for all an=
d many may feel aversion. More dangerously, 
some people may feel attractio=
n for it based on a wrong understanding and the 
thrill such an understandi=
ng brings. Aghora stands for neither thrills nor 
perversion, though i=
t *may* attract some people pursuing thrills and/or 
perversion. The basic =
tenets of Aghora and Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, but 
Aghora tries to =
accelerates how one absorbs the truth into one's thinking by 
making failur=
e very unpleasant.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>BTW, the following mail giv=
es a good analogy for various spiritual paths 
and explains the basic reali=
ty. It may be interesting to read in the context of 
aghora.</DIV>

        <DIV><FONT face=

        <DIV>Thank you for your reply=
. </DIV>
        <DIV><FONT face=3DArial></FONT> </DIV>
        <DIV>I=
 understand that Chandi and Lalita are two different forms of the 
        =
Universal Mother. But what I am trying to understand is that 
   =
     how to worship both forms simultaneously. For instance, Sri 
    =
    Muththuswamy Diskshitar, was a great composer (one of the Divine Trinit=
y 
        of Carnatic Music along with Thyagaraja and Shyama Sastry), who =
was a 
        self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka. His Kamalamba Navavarna 
    =
    Krithis mention great details about all the nine avarana=
s 
        and different forms of the divine mother as one goes through eac=
h 
        avarana. In the Dhyana Krithi of those, in the very&nb=
sp;first 
        line he says, 'Kamalambike, AsRta kalpalatike, ChanDike'.=
 That line 
        tells me that even through Sri Vidya one can =
worship Chandi Ma, in 
        that form. </DIV>
        <DIV><FONT fa=
ce=3DArial></FONT> </DIV>
        <DIV>So my question was in that pers=
pective. Anyway, your reply was a 
        great one in which you mentioned=
 how the Self is surrounded by layers of 
        duality! I never thought =
in those terms. </DIV>
        <DIV><FONT face=3DArial></FONT> </DIV>
=
        <DIV>I have started reading Durga Saptashati, just to get practise =
of 
        reading it fluently, before I start to do chandi homam, which I=
 plan to 
        do during navaratri of 2010. I really cannot wait to get =
comfortable 
        reading the saptashati! Have to see how mother will he=
lp me achieve my 
        target. </DIV>
        <DIV><FONT face=3DArial></=

        <DIV>Also, I have started to read the Aghora seri=
es books by Dr. Robert 
        Svobodha. For now I have very mixed feeling=
s on the subject. Perhaps I 
        need to read more! </DIV>
