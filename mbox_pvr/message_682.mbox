Namaste,

Before any pooja or homam, we do anga nyasa and kara nyasa and then 
digbandha. Nyasas are supposed to *place* the energy of certain sounds in 
specific chakras (energy centers) of the body. Then digbandha is supposed to 
lock all directions so that no energy except that of the deity being 
worshipped can enter the area. You are placing an energy fence around you 
that can be crossed only by a specific energy.

However, these procedures are a mere formality now-a-days and very few can 
actually do them as they are supposed to be done. Any person or energy can 
*penetrate* the area that has been locked out in the digbandha done by most 
people. It is ineffectual. However, the good thing with keeping the 
tradition alive is that knowledge is passed on and a capable person coming 
in a future generation can benefit from the knowledge passed on blindly and 
without experiential verification.

I stress surrender, devotion and sincerity and downplay various technical 
aspects to which most people - including many professional priests - cannot 
do justice anyway.

Best regards,
Narasimha
