Namaste,
 
I prematurely sent the last mail. This is the completed mail.
 
=
*        *        *
 
The same website also talks of "armageddon" and "worl=
d war 3" etc. See
 
http://www.spiritualresearchfoundation.org/articles/id/=
spiritualresearch/spiritualscience/armageddon
 
*        *        *
 
> All=
 this sounds quite fanciful, but can there be some truth in it?
 
Well, the=
re are other people and traditions suggesting major changes on earth in thi=
s timeframe. For example, Sri Achyutananda Dasa, who was one of the associa=
tes of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, apparently wrote that a Satya yuga like sub-pe=
riod within the major period of Kali yuga would start around 2000 AD. Some =
people think that Mayans believed that a new age of peace would be ushered =
in after 2012.
 
The conclusions on the website you mentioned are based on =
the visions of someone in deep meditation. The only thing I can say confide=
ntly about such things is that you cannot be confident of anything you expe=
rience or see, including in so-called "deep meditation". Mind is very power=
ful. It is easy to hallucinate.
 
Any knowledge or vision or experience in =
deep meditation is colored by the ego of the person experiencing it. As lon=
g as there is a small seed of ego (I-ness) left, the mental conditioning an=
d belief system of that I-ness will influence all experiences. When one ove=
rcomes ego completely, one merges in Brahman. In order to experience the du=
al world, one needs to have an ego. If a yogi who was absorbed in Brahman f=
or a while (i.e. in nirvikalpa samadhi) comes back into duality, ego (I-nes=
s) will return. However faint, it will have some conditioning, which will c=
olor one's vision of the world. Thus, one's visions are never 100% reliable=
, even if one is the highest level sadhaka who has been in nirvikalpa samad=
hi. What to say then of the visions of normal sadhakas? The power of dualit=
y is such that even great jnaanis can be deluded. I will not put much value=
 on anyone's visions or insights.
 
Sadhakas who have made some progress ma=
y be able to tap to some correct knowledge, but it will be corrupted by wro=
ng knowledge. So, while there may be some element of truth in their expecta=
tions, I will not waste time on it.
 
*        *        *
 
Does it matter =
if our sadhana gives 1x result or 50x results? Why should that matter? Just=
 do what you are capable of doing, without expecting anything or thinking o=
f the returns. These calculations only corrupt the attitude.
 
Forget all t=
his stuff and just do your sadhana. The goal is to increase the sense of su=
rrender to the chosen deity, decrease false ego and eventually become reali=
zed.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
