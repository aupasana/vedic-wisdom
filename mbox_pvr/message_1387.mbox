Namaste,

As one does spiritual sadhana, some shakti (can be translated as energy or 
purity) may be accumulated. However, certain egoistic actions make one lose 
some or all of the accumulated shakti.

Long hair and beard trap some shakti and help avoid situations where one 
commits an action that results in a loss of all of one's shakti. They 
improve the control over senses in tricky situations.

It is like a small railing atop a mountain. If one wanders off at night, 
those railings can stop one from falling. A small barrier can make a big 
difference at critical times. Beard and long hair are like that small 
barrier.

Of course, a small railing cannot save a car driving at 70 mph from plunging 
down. But it can stop a person wandering at night. Similarly, beard and long 
hair are not sufficient for control over senses, but one who made a lot of 
progress and still struggling at some critical times can benefit 
significantly from long hair and beard.

BTW, the tradition of growing long hair or beard is not limited to Hinduism. 
It is there in many religions.

Best regards,
Narasimha
