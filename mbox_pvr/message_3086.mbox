Dear Siva,

My sincere apologies if I offended you or offend you now.

*        *        *

Krishna ran away because Jarasandh should not be killed by him and was 
destined to be killed by Bheema. But please note that it was *Jarasandh* who 
attacked.

In the case of the debate in question, it was agreed to by *both* the sides, 
pre-planned as a mega event, rules were laid out, it was advertized well and 
50,000 people showed up! Many more must have watched it.

Zakir Naik is someone who claimed *on TV* that 9/11 was an insider's job 
done by George Bush himself so that Bush could then attack oil-rich 
countries. When he was visiting Cardiff, Welsh MP David Davies described him 
as a "hate-monger" and said his views did not deserve a "public platform". 
Khushwant Singh, a highly prominent Indian journalist, used the word to 
""juvenile" to describe Naik's arguments and said that "they seldom rise 
above the level of undergraduate college debates, where contestants vie with 
each other to score brownie points". When Dr Naik offered to engage in a 
live public debate with Pope Benedict XVI, the Pope ignored him and did not 
even dignify him with a response. This is the kind of opponent we are 
talking about.

When a person like this wants to debate one on religion, one should ideally 
ignore him. If one actually engages him, one should tear him to pieces and 
put him in his place, which is quite possible to do without stooping down or 
losing one's class. At the very least, one should hold one's own. Sri Sri 
was like a fish of out water, came across as being clueless, did not even 
utilize all of his allotted time, and allowed himself to be destroyed by the 
ruthless Dr Naik. He cut a sorry figure. If Dr Naik later shot up to Number 
3 on the Indian Express list of "Top 10 Spiritual Gurus of India", it was 
most probably due to the debate with Sri Sri. I am not saying these ratings 
matter, but the bottomline is that Sri Sri's utter failure in the debate 
increased following for a person with crazy and fanatical views (e.g. see 
above), who misunderstands sanatana dharma and yet puts it down very 
emphatically and enthusiastically. And this debate was not forced on Sri 
Sri, but he pre-agreed and they pre-planned this as a mega event!

Yes, an avatar may choose to lose if it is necessary for a larger purpose in 
the leela as you said, but I fail to see any "larger purpose" in this thing 
yet.

*        *        *

Thanks for admitting that you yourself have not yet intellectually 
understood it!

Because of your *faith* that Sri Sri is a yogi in "sahaja samadhi", you 
believe that there must be some higher purpose served by this action of his. 
I respect your faith. Faith not supported by logic and intellectual 
understanding cannot be discussed further. As you believe, Sri Sri may 
indeed be someone in "sahaja samadhi" and there may be a higher purpose to 
be served by his action. But there are other possibilities as well.

*        *        *

Bottomline is that we are discussing things intellectually when we use 
vaikhari (*tangible* words - written or spoken) to communicate. We are not 
communicating here using para or pasyanti or madhyama modes. Of course, even 
in the debate, Sri Sri and Dr Naik seemed to be using vaikhari only.

Sometimes, you see some great masters communicating at levels higher than 
vaikhari. There is something unsaid (para, pasyanti or madhyama) that lies 
behind the said words (vaikhari) and gets into the mind of the listener and 
creates an indelible effect on the mind. Swami Vivekananda's historic 1893 
speech at Chicago, for example, had a far more mesmerizing effect on the 
audience present there than you would expect those mere words to have. 
Though he was not in sahaja samadhi at that stage, he had a high level of 
realization. Moreover, he accumulated shakti by controlling his mind from 
desires, attachments, likes, dislikes and shadripus for several years. He 
also received the shakti accumulated likewise by his master, before the 
latter left body. Due to all that shakti, his thoughts directly touched the 
minds of people around him.

If master debaters like Swami Vivekananda or Aadi Shankara had debated 
someone of the stature of Dr Naik, I can imagine what they would have done.

Best regards,
Narasimha

Gnana Yogas


Dear Shri. Narasimha,
    I was giving an explanation from my understanding, but it was still at 
my mental level. The actions of an englightened master established in Sahaja 
Samadhi does not need to satisfy our mental concepts of how things should 
be.

 For example, when Sri Krishna - an Avatar of the highest order, ran away 
from the battlefield when Jarasandh attacked Mathura instead of fighting and 
defeating Jarasandh. Sri Krishna himself years later would advice Arjuna 
against dropping arms in a fight. Can we give a satisfying intellectual 
answer to it if people raise questions?

Sri Aurobindo gave a beautiful explanation about it. It was something like: 
If Krishna were constrained to win all times, that would be a limitation in 
itself! An Avatar chooses even defeat if it is necessary for a larger and 
more complete victory in the scheme of the lela. You ofcourse have to read 
the original to get his exact words.. I read it long ago.

Another instance that comes to mind - Some thieves came and beat up Ramana 
Maharishi and made a big nuisance in his Ashram. Ramana Maharishi bore it 
with equanimity. Sri Ramana was the Spiritual head of the Ashram and one can 
intellectually argue that it was his dharma to protect the ashram and 
inmates from the thieves.

Besides, there were certain things that I did not want to put in an public 
email.

Some clues - AOL silverjubilee with over 2 million people meditating and 
doing sudarhsn Kriya together happened around Feb 16, 2006. There were 
several threats from certain militants from one community about planting 
bombs or disrupting it in other ways police security provided was not 
sufficient for that sized gathering.

The concerned debate where lot of SIMI members were among the participants 
happened few weeks earlier on Jan 21, 2006.

Some people believe Sri Sri's presence in the event changed the heart of 
some miscreants.

Many does not know that Sri Sri had cancelled meetings with the future head 
of state of a superpower few minutes before the meeting was to happen. 
Sometimes he attends some events which cannot be explained logically by his 
disciples such as the debate with Zakir Naik. The beauty about an 
enlightened Master living in Sahaja Samadhi is that we cannot contain them 
in our mind. They operate from a plane of consciousness that is much higher.

As the Mother would say if something is beyond our mental understanding, we 
can maintain a respectable silence about it.

I do not expect my answers to satisfy all the questions. I feel I have said 
everything I had to say.

In hind sight, I realize that I should not have ventured to give an 
intellectual explanation for something that I myself have not yet 
intellectually understood.

I did want to object to some statements saying Sri Sri did not know what do 
say or was confused. It was a judgement of those without any knowledge or 
understanding of Sri Sri, just as someone who does not understand Sri 
Krishna might judge him differently for several of His acts which could not 
be intellectually explained. Having observed him in person with questions 
several times tricker than what Zakir Naik said, I can confidently say that 
it was not true.

Best regards,
-Siva.
