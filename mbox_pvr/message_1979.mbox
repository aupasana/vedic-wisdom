Namaste,
 
The three sips of water in aachamanam are for the three worlds w=
ithin us (bhuh, bhuvah, suvah). We offer three sips of water for giving ene=
rgy to the three worlds and purifying them. That can be done at the beginni=
ng of the ritual as well as the middle or end.
 
If you are going to do an =
important job, it is fine to do aachamanam before it.
 
The instruction you=
 had on not washing your hands or feet after coming back from a temple is t=
o not lose any influence you received at the temple. If you were in the pre=
sence of a large spiritual energy/purity field (e.g. visit to a good temple=
 or visit to a good saint or a visit to a place where a lot of people are e=
ngaged in pure thoughts etc), some of the small chakras in the body (e.g. t=
he chakras in finger tips etc) may be charged with a little energy. It is a=
 good idea to let that remain as long as possible without disturbing. So el=
ders advise that way.
 
But, sipping water is different.
 
Best regards,
Na=
rasimha

  Subject: [ved=
ic-wisdom] Achamanam after the ritual

        Dear All, 

        At the e=
nd of Sandhya Vandanam, we do Achamanam again. I thought that Achamanam is =
required BEFORE performing a spiritual activity, which we do anyway. But wh=
at is the significance of doing it AFTER it? Similarly, if you remember the=
 end of the holy Aditya Hrudhayam stotram, there's the verse "thriraachamya=
 suchirbhootvaa dhanuraadhaaya veeryavaan" which comes after the verse whic=
h mentions Bhagavan Sri Rama chanting the stotram. Is it that the ensuing b=
attle itself is considered a spiritual activity needing purification before=
 one starts it? When I try relate it to the popular custom of "not washing =
one's hands and feets" upon arrival back home, after visiting a temple, I g=
et confused. 

        Regards, 
        Hari
