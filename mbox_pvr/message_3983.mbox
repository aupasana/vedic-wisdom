Namaste,
 
Yes, it is ok to put swaha at the end. Not adding swaha for Ratri and Devi sooktam is suggested by some because people of this age may not be able to figure out modification of the ending intonation to add swaahaa. If you are not doing Vedic versions and doing pournaanik versions, there is no problem. The one in chapter 5 is pouraanik version of Devi sooktam. The Vedic version from Rigveda goes as aham rudrebhiHs.
 
If you want to do a smaller version instead of all 700 verses, I suggest doing a homam with the 4th or 11th chapters of saptashati.
 
I am usually quite busy and have to leave out some mails without replying.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
