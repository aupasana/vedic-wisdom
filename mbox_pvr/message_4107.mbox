Namaste,
 
Everyone plays their allotted role. But the roles are not static=
. They are dynamic and may undergo fine-tuning or modification or evolution=
 from time to time (and life to life) based on how we play our allotted rol=
es. 
 
The role you are given is your destiny and how you play it is your f=
ree will. How you play your role now (free will) influences what role you a=
re given in future (destiny).
 
If the role given to you (e.g. Arjuna) is t=
o kill your guru (Drona) and relatives, you cannot escape it. But you can e=
ither do it with a hateful mind or a guilty mind or you can do it with a ca=
lm mind. If the role given to you (e.g. Janaka) is to rule a big kingdom, y=
ou cannot escape and do penances in a forest. But you can either rule the k=
ingdom with a proud and attached mind or with a calm mind. If the role give=
n to you (e.g. Swami Samarth Ramadas) is to guide a mighty king (Shivaji) i=
n resisting the invading muslim kings, you cannot escape it. But you can ei=
ther do it with an attached and agitated mind or a calm mind.
 
People in t=
he examples I mentioned above engaged in what may seem like material action=
s, but they did them after overcoming attachments and with an equanimous mi=
nd.
 
As I keep saying, what you do is a secondary factor and how you do it=
 is primary. Even as we engage in actions that we believe to be our dharma,=
 we should work on our attitude and increase surrender. When one has surren=
dered to god and is able to look at pleasure and pain, praise and censure i=
n the same way, then one's dharma will be far clearer to one. One whose min=
d is densely conditioned by duality and desires will see one's dharma throu=
gh the coloring of that conditioning and may misjudge. On the other hand, o=
ne with a clear mind with very little conditioning will see one's dharma cl=
earer.
 
In simpler words, one who heavily identifies with the body and wan=
ts comforts and pleasures of the body will see one's dharma from that motiv=
ation. One may identify with body, with a group of people, with a deity etc=
. As is the identification, so is the conditioning and so is one's vision o=
f one's dharma.
 
Though everyone is playing their allotted role, some have=
 densely conditioned minds and unable to see their dharma clearly and pursu=
ing adharma. As a result, they may continue to be allotted roles where dens=
ely conditioned minds restrict their actions, in future.
 
Some have very c=
lear minds and able to see their dharma clearly and pursuing higher dharma.=
 As a result, they may continue to allotted roles where lighter and lighter=
 mental conditioning restricts them and eventually they become free.
 
One =
can try to use free will to move from the former case to the latter case.

Narasimha
