=C2=A0 
Namaste,
=C2=A0
I=
n one way, nothing is wasted. Everything is consumed by various beings and =
finally merges back in the five elements. Even if you throw food in trash, =
it gets consumed by various microbodies and eventually the five elements in=
 the food return to the elements in Nature.
=C2=A0
But, when food is in our=
 hands (as per our perception), we should use it to fulfil our higher rinas=
 than lower rinas. We have so many rinas and should use the resources at ou=
r disposal wisely.
=C2=A0
Rinas to various deities and associates who run t=
he universe are the highest rinas we have. Fulfilling those rinas makes tho=
se beings within us (the microcosm) pleased, places us in a nice and balanc=
ed state and that is good for our entire consciousness. It enables us to pi=
ck the optimal actions at every kaarmik crossroads. In comparison, giving f=
ood to a few individuals balances only a few aspects of our consciousness. =
Thus, offering ghee and other food in fire to celestial beings is not infer=
ior, but much superior, to feeding food to other people.
=C2=A0
Sin is a he=
avy word. The bottomline is that every action gives a reaction. You choose =
your actions wisely so that their reactions propel you in the direction of =
liberation.
=C2=A0
Thanks,
Narasimha

Respect Sir, 
=C2=A0 
If you had the time to read all the accepted Sh=
astras and list down all the instructions given therein, you will realize i=
t is impossible to satisfy all conditions. Infact, often they are contradic=
tory. Why? Because each shastras is powerful and valid for a particular tim=
e, place and cultural setting. At one point it was considered leaving ones =
"desh" and crossing an ocean was a terrific sin. What is "desh"? India the =
country did not exist. Ones village was ones desh and everything around, fr=
om the next village to the end of the landmass was all "videsh". So if I ap=
ply that logic today, how many people in this forum have already committed =
this great "sin"? Nearly everyone. Because the settings have changed. 
=C2=
=A0 
The Vedas are considered an eternal book, because the Veda samhitas co=
ntain descriptions of spiritual states in allegorical form. They are not a =
book of good ethical living. Apart from the core-veda samhitas, all dharmic=
 rulebooks are never ment for eternity. In changed scenarios, they too must=
 undergo change. But based on what? A natural sense of right and wrong, pro=
portion and disproportion, arising out of a clear heart. There is no greate=
r rule book for ethical living than ones own heart. Follow it, and you won'=
t be disappointed. If you keep following your heart through thick and thin,=
 the sense of right and wrong (discrimination) will develop in such a fashi=
on that you won't need sanction from anywhere, but your own self, for your =
actions. That is creating a Viveka-chudamani. 
=C2=A0 
Wasting food anyway =
is a bad habit. We know it. Feeding the needy whenever possible is always a=
 good habit. That too we know.=C2=A0 Feed others, human or animal whenever =
you can, and when you can't; don't bother. Most important of all, don't bot=
her about violating a rulebook and thus committing a 'sin'. That is such a =
terrific wastage of mental energy.

To my knowledge, i understand that, as per our script=

Your message reminded of story of Saint Tiruvalluvar. He used t=
