Namaste Sir,
=C2=A0
Both Tirupati an=
d Sri Kalahasti are nice temples with nice spiritual energy that have been =
diluted to some extent. There is another less known temple in the area that=
 is really good.
=C2=A0
My father is a frequent visitor to that area. His f=
avorite temple there, and I agree with him, is the one in "Narayana Vanam".=
 It is a little away from Tirupati and hardly anybody visits that temple.

=C2=A0
The temple there has fantastic spiritual vibrations. Worth a visit I=
MHO!

Hi Srinivas, 
Thanks for your =
inputs and sharing the link of the post written by PVRji. 
I being a tough =
person, can follow any strict rule. But since this is our first visit to Ti=
rupati and Kalahasti, my family was insisting to visit both the temples, as=
 they were not aware of all the rules, and like any normal person would arg=
ue why not visit Tirupati temple when we are going there. We are going for =
a Rahu-Ketu- Sarpa dosha parihara pooja, so if a tradition/rule require to =
go to that temple only, then I will just go to Kalahasti only, but as PVRji=
 wrote in his post. 
" The rationale behind the astrologer's guidance is so=
mewhat similar to the one behind the statement you find towards the end of =
homam manuals: "If you used a kalasam (water pot) in addition to an idol to=
 invoke the god, you can take a bath with the water in the kalasam. Pour th=
e water on yourself after you finish your bath, while saying a mantra of <h=
omam deity>. After pouring that water on yourself, don't pour any more regu=
lar water. The water from kalasam should be the last water you pour on your=
self in the bath." 
=C2=A0 
When you visit a spiritually charged place, you=
r subtle body carries some of that energy and tries to absorb it. If you ei=
ther stay at the pariharam temple for a long time and go home directly from=
 there, the chance of absorbing that specific energy is maximized ." 
=C2=
=A0 
Based on this logic--- it seems we can visit Tirupati first (Like a re=
gular temple visit and darshan) and then go to Kalahasti, perform the pooja=
, spend max time there and go to home/hotel. For me, it would be hotel in C=
hennai where I will spend a night before heading back my hometown. Hope I a=
m not making any mistakes. 
Regards 

Vikram
