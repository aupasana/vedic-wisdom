Unfortunat=
ely, this verse depends on the context built by the previous 14 verses of R=
V 10.95. Though I intended to type out a detailed mail with my independent =
interpretation of all the verses in that chapter, it is a big task and I am=
 unable to find time for it.

Fortunately, I chanced upon a nice website gi=
ving the Hindi translation (including word-by-word meanings) of all the fou=
r Vedas by Swami Dayananda Saraswati. Though not at the same depth as Aurob=
indo's commentary (which was limited to a few verses), his exhaustive work =
is quite good.

If you are comfortable with Hindi language, please use this=
 website for commentary on Vedas in future. It is far far far far better th=
an the English commentary on the site you referred to. I checked out some s=
ample verses and quite pleased with the commentary. This work is similar in=
 wavelength to my own thinking and I am comfortable recommending this. Thou=
gh it does not internalize enough in several places, it is not dumb and sil=
ly like other internet commentaries.

In the case of RV 10.95 that you enqu=
ired about, Swami Dayananda Saraswati interpreted Pururava as a cloud conta=
ining water and Urvashi as vidyut (electricity, i.e. lightening). This is q=
uite intelligent and acceptable to me, though my view expressed in the mail=
 below internalizes it further.

The website is

http://www.aryasama jjamna=
gar. org/

Click the link on the right for Rigveda bhashya (bhashya=3Dcomme=
ntary ). God bless Arya Samaj folks at Jamnagar!

Best regards,
Narasimha
