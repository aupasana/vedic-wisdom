Namaste,

Yes, you can meditate at the end of homam without any sound. When chanting 
the mantra as a part of homam (with swaahaa and with offerings), read it 
with minimum sound. If lips are moving to the mantra, that is enough. But 
when meditating at the end, you can be absolutely soundless and 
movementless. It is better that way actually.

Yes, you can do in the evening.

Do not think of homam as just regular fire. It is a representation of 
divinity - the soul and the Sun. Homa purifies all elements, especially 
fire. If there are fire element related problems in the horoscope, homam can 
purify the fire element.

I really suggest Ganapathi for a few months. After that, switch to Shiva.

The big fire Manish was shown by those siddhas is a symbolic representation 
of the regular homam done by thousands of people in future. Those who are 
here and slowly starting are the first few.

Best regards,
Narasimha
