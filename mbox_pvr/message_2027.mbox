=C2=A0
I have a question. Though it will probably sound=
 stupid to a learned man like you, but I just could not get a convincing an=
swer to it, so thought of putting this question in this forum.
=C2=A0
=C2=
=A0
You mentioned that a=C2=A0senior=C2=A0Maharishi is doing this. In the b=
ooks of Vimalananda he says Naths, Munis and Rishis are higher beings, even=
 higher than deities.
=C2=A0
What confuses me is that, what can be higher t=
han a deity? For example Goddes Durga is the supreme mother of all worlds, =
then how can a Rishi or any being be higher than Her? Or lord Shiva =C2=A0o=
r Narayana?
=C2=A0
I mean is it the Rishi who is acting our the Mother's in=
structions or is it She who is creating the environment for the Rishi's wis=
h to come true? Which one came first?
=C2=A0
It gets confusing-:(. 
=C2=A0
=
As a devotee it is natural and simple to believe that the God I pray to is =
the Ultimate Supreme authority, but when I hear that Rishis are even beyond=
 this, then doubt creeps in, is the deity therefore not as supreme as is ma=
de out to be?
=C2=A0
Sorry if these questions seem childish, but I really g=
et confused thinking about this.

=EF=BB=BF 
Namaste,
=C2=A0
Au=
robindo need not be talking about a single "savior" the way people may imag=
ine. Also, he need not be talking about somebody "connected to" his ashram.=
 Moreover, when it comes to great lineages, there are connections between a=
ll. For example, Aurobindo used to visit the house of Sister Nivedita, the =
foremost disciple of Swami Vivekananda and knew her well when he still live=
d in Calcutta. He had a vision in his prison cell of Swami Vivekananda, jus=
t=C2=A0a few years after his death, in which he imparted Aurobindo some key=
 knowledge. Paramahamsa Yogananda grew up in Calcutta and learnt Sanskrit f=
rom M, who was a sishya of Ramakrishna and wrote the gospel of Ramakrishna.=
 Trilinga Swami sent a tantra teacher to Ramakrishna to expand his knowledg=
e. Trilinga Swami knew Lahiri mahashaya and admired him. And so on.
=C2=A0
=
Coming back to the main point, the supermind established in the field of ea=
rth that was referred to by Aurobindo can simply be a maharshi paying some =
attention to matters on earth. A maharshi absorbed in the divine in one of =
the higher planes of consciousness can accomplish huge changes on earth by =
the mere power of his thought. If there is a divine play to make some posit=
ive changes on earth and a maharshi takes part in the play, he may focus a =
small part of his supermind on the affairs of earth and direct a few import=
ant souls to do some key work.=C2=A0Some important souls (deities, rishis o=
r yogis etc) may send their amshas (partial essence) to be born on earth to=
 fulfil different parts of a divine play.
=C2=A0
You may then see several (=
not just one) elevated beings, enlightened beings and realized beings born =
on earth to bring clarity in different aspects of spiritual knowledge. Each=
 of them will get specific internal/external guidance from the divine, base=
d on what their part in the play is.

The "Asu=
ra of Falsehood" that Aurobindo alluded to is all around us. At the subtles=
t level, he manifests as false ego in pretty much everybody. At the grosses=
t level, he=C2=A0manifests as blatant lies, wrong propaganda etc.
=C2=A0
On=
e should not tolerate this Asura (demon) and fight hard. However, one shoul=
d not hate this Asura or those afflicted by him. When we encounter lies, we=
 should fight and stand for truth but not hate the liar at the same time. T=
here is nothing that needs to be hated in this world. One should learn to d=

hing or anybody and with unconditional love (i.e. no expectations of a retu=
rn) to all.
=C2=A0

=C2=A0
I know very little=
. But I was told that an age that is somewhat like the bygone ages will be =
established on earth for a few hundred years in the coming decades. The rea=
son the Divine Mother appeared before Manish and asked him to spread simple=
 homam procedures in the world was to prepare the grounds for that. Manish =
also told me that all this is the play of a senior maharshi.

by it. Who might be coming down to earth to help Human Beings?

Namaste
=C2=A0
I found an intere=
sting article based on Sri Aurobindo's writing. I am posting it here for an=
yone interested.
=C2=A0
Near the beginning of the 20th century the great In=
dian freedom fighter and yogi-sage, Sri Aurobindo, began to express a truth=
 which had not been expressed before. In his high states of divine union he=
 saw that the time had come for a new stage in the evolution of mankind. He=
 saw that the divine was to manifest right here on Earth and that the time =
for this divine emergence into Earth life was now. He spoke of heaven desce=
nding to Earth, even as Earth experienced a breakdown due to the intrinsic =
resistance held within her material body towards this =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=
=BF=BD
=EF=BF=BD
Sri Aurobindo was joined in Pondicherry, India, by a Frenc=
h mystic, Mirra Alfassa, who later became known as the Mother. Together the=
y embarked on a journey of intensive cellular transformation that is very r=
elevant to the colossal uncertainties we face today.
=EF=BF=BD
Sri Aurobind=
o saw that the divine force permeates all matter, and that all matter there=
fore has a force of consciousness. The process of the divine spirit descend=
ing down into matter is called involution. The process by which the divine =
ascends back upwards out of matter is called evolution. According to Sri Au=
robindo, humanity has reached a stage where these two events are occurring =
simultaneously, and in his inner visions, he foresaw that we would soon be =
experiencing a descent of what he called =EF=BF=BDsupramental (or monadic) =
consciousness=EF=BF=BD that would entirely change everything on Earth.
=EF=
=BF=BD
Man=EF=BF=BDs greatness is not in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, bu=
t in what he makes possible. An immortal soul is somewhere within him, even=
 if seldom active in most people, while an eternal spirit overshadows him, =
even if obstructed from descent by the hard lid of his constructed personal=
ity. There is a great divine plan in motion, even if the evidence of the ou=
ter senses seems to contradict it.

Sri Aurobindo recognized that humankind=
 is going through an evolutionary crisis. A stage has been reached in which=
 the human mind has made tremendous strides on the one hand, but is left ho=
pelessly inadequate to prevent its own extinction as a species. Meanwhile, =
as the Mother testified before her death in 1973, a consciousness higher th=
an the human rational mind, what may be termed the Supermind, has recently =
been established in the fields of the Earth, and is active there. Our task =
now is to bring it down into cellular consciousness.

Evolution took a grea=
t leap forward with the origins of Life, and later with the emergence of Mi=
nd. We are now at the threshold of another leap forward, even more momentou=
s, as we prepare for the emergence of the Supermind. Sri Aurobindo speaks a=
bout four stages of human evolution, which we will soon be starting to expe=
rience concurrently upon Earth. The first is =EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=
=BD our current species, a rational being possessing an individualized soul=
, but largely obstructed from contacting and merging with it.
=EF=BF=BD
Nex=
t is the =EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a species that is spontaneous- ly c=
oming to birth under the influence of an ever-expanding supramental field, =
a being that is largely able to merge and live from soul-consciousness rath=
er than mind-consciousness. 
=C2=A0
Thirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=
=BD who will still inhabit a dense physical body, but will be in possession=
 of the Mind of Light, which is supramental consciousness that has begun to=
 merge with cellular consciousness. 
=C2=A0
Finally, our ultimate goal as a=
 species is the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity incarnated fu=
lly within the subtle realms of matter. This will be a race of what we coul=
d call =EF=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In this species, the unity of m=
atter and spirit would be fully realized upon Earth.

The great work of Sri=
 Aurobindo and the Mother was in bringing supramental consciousness down in=
to the cellular consciousness of their own bodies. Since this is a unified =
consciousness, this meant that the supramental consciousness was simultaneo=
usly being brought into the consciousness fields of the Earth, awaiting the=
 moment when it would flower into its full manifestation in collective matt=
er.
Whenever there is a =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is corresponding re=
sistance. Sri Aurobindo and the Mother speak of their experience with the f=
our =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD essentially anti-divine forces, at work in th=
e world today. There is the Asura of Darkness, the Asura of Suffering, The =
Asura of Falsehood, and the Asura of Death. These are the forces that are s=
o outwardly apparent, and which seem to be in control of current global eve=
nts. According to them the Asura of Darkness (Lucifer?) has gone through a =
transformation recently, and the Asura of Suffering has returned to Source,=
 and so only the latter two still remain to wreak havoc on Earth. Interesti=
ngly, they spoke of the Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD thr=
ough Hitler during World War II, and of their own intensive inner work in c=
ountering his influence. It would not be difficult to see how this same Asu=
ra may be influencing other world leaders in the current political sphere.
=

With the descent of this new vibratory consciousness all our old obsolete =
human structures will be demolished. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that=
 although the changes will be enormous they would not be necessarily catast=
rophic. The power of Truth automatically erases Falsehood, and our world fo=
r the most part consists of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, he maintained,=
 carried a power of harmonization which could overcome this resistance by m=
eans other than dramatic struggle and violence. The Asuras will eventually =
be absorbed into their original emanations of Light, Life, Beauty, and Trut=
h. It may be interesting to speculate, with all the violence in the world t=
oday, the destruction we might have experienced if not for this power of ha=
rmonization!

When does all this happen? Sri Aurobindo and the Mother belie=
ved that the world stage was set for this quantum descent, and that it was =
quite imminent. The Mother said in 1968 that the supramental transformation=
 was a certainty now, and that it would come about with a minimum of destru=
ction, =EF=BF=BDalthough this minimum is still considerable.=EF=BF=BD She s=
aid that the year 2000 would be a turning point.
=C2=A0
This was a very int=
eresting read and matches what Narasimhaji says about changes coming in the=
 world.

<DIV>I found an interesting article based on Sri Aurobin=
do's writing. I am posting it here for anyone interested.</DIV>
<DIV><FONT =
face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>Near the beginning of the 20=
th century the great Indian freedom fighter and yogi-sage, Sri Aurobindo, b=
egan to express a truth which had not been expressed before. In his high st=
ates of divine union he saw that the time had come for a new stage in the e=
volution of mankind. He saw that the divine was to manifest right here on E=
arth and that the time for this divine emergence into Earth life was now. H=
e spoke of heaven descending to Earth, even as Earth experienced a breakdow=
n due to the intrinsic resistance held within her material body towards thi=
s =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD<BR>=EF=BF=BD<BR>Sri Aurobindo was joined in Po=
ndicherry, India, by a French mystic, Mirra Alfassa, who later became known=
 as the Mother. Together they embarked on a journey of intensive cellular t=
ransformation that is very relevant to the colossal uncertainties we face t=
oday.<BR>=EF=BF=BD<BR>Sri Aurobindo saw that the divine force permeates all=
 matter, and that all matter therefore has a force of
 consciousness. The p=
rocess of the divine spirit descending down into matter is called involutio=
n. The process by which the divine ascends back upwards out of matter is ca=
lled evolution. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a stage wh=
ere these two events are occurring simultaneously, and in his inner visions=
, he foresaw that we would soon be experiencing a descent of what he called=
 =EF=BF=BDsupramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=BD that would entire=
ly change everything on Earth.<BR>=EF=BF=BD<BR>Man=EF=BF=BDs greatness is n=
ot in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in what he makes possible. An imm=
ortal soul is somewhere within him, even if seldom active in most people, w=
hile an eternal spirit overshadows him, even if obstructed from descent by =
the hard lid of his constructed personality. There is a great divine plan i=
n motion, even if the evidence of the outer senses seems to contradict it.<=
/DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT><BR>Sri Aurobindo recognized =
that humankind is going through an evolutionary crisis. A stage has been re=
ached in which the human mind has made tremendous strides on the one hand, =
but is left hopelessly inadequate to prevent its own extinction as a specie=
s. Meanwhile, as the Mother testified before her death in 1973, a conscious=
ness higher than the human rational mind, what may be termed the Supermind,=
 has recently been established in the fields of the Earth, and is active th=
ere. Our task now is to bring it down into cellular consciousness.<BR></DIV=
>
<DIV>Evolution took a great leap forward with the origins of Life, and la=
ter with the emergence of Mind. We are now at the threshold of another leap=
 forward, even more momentous, as we prepare for the emergence of the Super=
mind. Sri Aurobindo speaks about four stages of human evolution, which we w=
ill soon be starting to experience concurrently upon Earth. The first is =
=EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current species, a rational being posse=
ssing an individualized soul, but largely obstructed from contacting and me=
rging with it.<BR>=EF=BF=BD<BR>Next is the =EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a=
 species that is spontaneous- ly coming to birth under the influence of an =
ever-expanding supramental field, a being that is largely able to merge and=
 live from soul-consciousness rather than mind-consciousness. </DIV>
<DIV><=
FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>Thirdly is the =EF=BF=
=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still inhabit a dense physical body, but will=
 be in possession of the Mind of Light, which is supramental consciousness =
that has begun to merge with cellular consciousness. </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=
=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>Finally, our ultimate goal as a =
species is the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity incarnated ful=
ly within the subtle realms of matter. This will be a race of what we could=
 call =EF=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In this species, the unity of ma=
tter and spirit would be fully realized upon Earth.<BR></DIV>
<DIV>The grea=
t work of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was in bringing supramental consciou=
sness down into the cellular consciousness of their own bodies. Since this =
is a unified consciousness, this meant that the supramental consciousness w=
as simultaneously being brought into the consciousness fields of the Earth,=
 awaiting the moment when it would flower into its full manifestation in co=
llective matter.<BR>Whenever there is a =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is =
corresponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo and the Mother speak of their exper=
ience with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD essentially anti-divine force=
s, at work in the world today. There is the Asura of Darkness, the Asura of=
 Suffering, The Asura of Falsehood, and the Asura of Death. These are the f=
orces that are so outwardly apparent, and which seem to be in control of cu=
rrent global events. According to them the Asura of Darkness (Lucifer?) has=
 gone through a transformation recently, and the Asura of Suffering has
 re=
turned to Source, and so only the latter two still remain to wreak havoc on=
 Earth. Interestingly, they spoke of the Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanne=
ling=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during World War II, and of their own intensiv=
e inner work in countering his influence. It would not be difficult to see =
how this same Asura may be influencing other world leaders in the current p=
olitical sphere.<BR></DIV>
<DIV>With the descent of this new vibratory cons=
ciousness all our old obsolete human structures will be demolished. However=
, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that although the changes will be enormous they =
would not be necessarily catastrophic. The power of Truth automatically era=
ses Falsehood, and our world for the most part consists of Falsehood. Yet, =
the Supramental, he maintained, carried a power of harmonization which coul=
d overcome this resistance by means other than dramatic struggle and violen=
ce. The Asuras will eventually be absorbed into their original emanations o=
f Light, Life, Beauty, and Truth. It may be interesting to speculate, with =
all the violence in the world today, the destruction we might have experien=
ced if not for this power of harmonization!<BR></DIV>
<DIV><U>When does all=
 this happen? Sri Aurobindo and the Mother believed that the world stage wa=
s set for this quantum descent, and that it was quite imminent. The Mother =
said in 1968 that the supramental transformation was a certainty now, and t=
hat it would come about with a minimum of destruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough th=
is minimum is still considerable.=EF=BF=BD She said that the year 2000 woul=
d be a turning point.</U></DIV>

<DIV>This was a ve=
ry interesting read and matches what Narasimhaji says about changes coming =
in the world.</DIV>
