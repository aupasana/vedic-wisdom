Namaste friends,
 
A mail on vedic-wisdom yahoogroup quoting Aurobindo is r=
elevant to this thread. Aurobindo's commentaries on Veda and Upanishat are =
the best and most insightful that you can find today. He is undoubtedly a r=
ishi. His diagnosis of the situation is very appropriate even today and bea=
utiful to read. I am copying it below.
 
When I say we need spiritual sadha=
kas who achieve detachment and equanimity and become instruments of Mother =
and when Aurobindo says we need a "nucleus of men in whom Shakti is develop=
ed to its uttermost extent", we are essentially saying the same thing in di=
fferent words. I am confident that the day will come when Aurobindo's desir=
e is fulfilled, within the next few decades. Unfortunately, I sometimes see=
 people who have the potential to be in the "nucleus" that Aurobindo refers=
 to joining the frustrated crowds on the periphery.
 
Rahul asked anna to "=
empower" him and others. A vessel of mud has to be baked before one can pou=
r water in it. Even a rishi like Vivekananda needed to do intense sadhana t=
o purify himself for several years before he could be empowered by Ramakris=
hna.
 
If one really wants to strengthen sanatana dharma, one needs to accu=
mulate spiritual shakti (and not waste it). I suggest the following. Take a=
 homam (e.g. Chandi homam or Ganapathi homam or Rama homam etc) and do it e=
veryday with some niyamas. Or take a mantra or prayer (e.g. Chandipath or V=
ishnu sahasra naam or manahamantra etc) and do it everyday for 2-3 hours wi=
th some niyamas. I can suggest the following niyamas - close the eyes, keep=
 the back straight during meditation and minimize body movement. Do the rit=
ual at the same time everyday at the same place (as much as possible). Main=
tain physical brahmacharya atleast and eventually mental too. Strive to get=
 control over emotions and not become angry or jealous or lustful etc, as o=
ne's shakti leaks (gets wasted) whenever one loses self control.
 
Sadhakas=
 engaging in intense sadhana, purifying themselves and achieving utter equa=
nimity and detachment will accumulate so much spiritual and mental shakti t=
hat they will combine and shake the world in the coming decades and establi=
sh sanatana dharma for a few centuries to come. It is for this purpose that=
 Mother asked my guru Manish Pandit, when She appeared in front of him in M=
arch 2006 at the Kalikambal temple in Chennai, to teach a very simple homam=
 procedure to interested sadhakas across the world without differentiating =
on the basis of class, caste and creed. Homam will enable several people to=
 purify themselves and accumulate spiritual shakti.
 
OK, now read what Aur=
obindo says.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

  =
Namaste Rahul and others,

  We all have some fire within us. When we chann=
el it properly, we fulfil our dharma successfully. When the fire is unchann=
eled and beset with impurities, we waste energy and fail to fulfil our dhar=
ma.

  Fire in conjunction with sattwa guna generates knowledge (jnaana sha=
kti). Fire in conjunction with rajo guna generates actions (kriyaa shakti).=
 Fire in conjunction with tamo guna generates desires (ichchhaa shakti). We=
 need people who mainly have sattwa and also some rajas. Such people have c=
lear thinking backed by correct knowledge and engage in fruitful actions. I=
t is more important to engage in a few fruitful actions than to engage in t=
oo many mis-directed actions and be left with unfulfilled desires and frust=
ration, which is what happens when there is too much tamas and rajas. There=
 are many self-styled "Hindutva" warriors today who fall in the latter cate=
gory. They yell from rooftops in shrill voices, but do not accomplish much.=
 Do we need some more such people?

  *        *        *

  What Hindutva =
needs today is a few detached Arjunas who destroy mighty armies without hat=
red for anyone in their heart. What Hindutva needs today is a few detached =
Vivekanandas who inspire millions with their magnetic personality without a=
ny passion in their heart.

  Act like a passionate man, but have no passio=
n in your heart. Fight unwaveringly, but have no hatred for anyone.

  If o=
ne is fighting a war with passion, frustration or hatred in one's heart, on=
e will only go so far and achieve only so much. What such a person achieves=
 will be short-lived. If one first overcomes attractions and repulsions, ha=
s a stable and unperturbed heart without passion and hatred and becomes a d=
etached instrument of Nature engaging in spontaneous actions without any at=
tachment, one will achieve much more and what one achieves will be long-liv=
ed.

  I am writing this to this group of people because my intuition tells=
 me that there are some on this group who have the potential to become such=
 instruments of Mother.

  Do some spiritual sadhana first and overcome the=
 weaknesses. Have a stable, unperturbed and equanimous heart. Then Nature w=
ill show you the way.

  *        *        *

  Ceturies ago, western invad=
ers went about their business with great dexterity and patience to affect t=
he psyche of Hindus, especially intelligentsia. Their slow, patient, dexter=
ous and systematic propaganda is bearing fruit even today. To undo their wo=
rk, one needs to be equally dexterous and patient. This is not the work for=
 hot-blooded, angry and frustrated people. One needs to be cool-headed, sma=
rt and patient.

  Another thing is that sanatana dharma is broken today. I=
n pursuit of modern education, the cream of Indian intelligentsia stopped e=
ngaging in our traditional knowledge. This brought a discontinuity in knowl=
edge. We have some faithful Hindus engaging in superstitious and/or purpose=
less practices. We have many priests who are corrupted by money and fame, d=
on't do any sadhana and don't have any spiritual strength. Many intelligent=
 people either dissociate themselves from religion or follow religion passi=
vely without much faith and with some shame or misgivings. At the root of t=
his is the broken knowledge and purposeless practices.

  Also, we have man=
y bad practices that afflict Hinduism due to Kali, which need to be gotten =
rid of. For example, caste system of today is so different from old days. T=
he concept of caste mobility is gone now - one would start with father's ca=
ste, but get a caste later on based on one's aptitude and attitude in old d=
ays. For example, Valmiki was a shudra by birth who lived by killing birds =
and he became a brahmana and a brahmarshi later. Vishwamitra was a kshatriy=
a by birth but became a brahmana and a brahmarshi later and even became one=
 of saptarshis. If lower caste and untouchable Hindus feel aversion to Hind=
uism which is exploted by Christian missionaries who offer money and respec=
t to convert, some fault lies with Hinduism too. We need to reform casteism=
.

  There are many things that need to be done. At one level, some propaga=
nda needs to be done on the greatness of Hinduism. This needs to be done wi=
th a cool, scholarly and patient attitude (as opposed to yelling in shrill =
voice from rooftops like some Hindutva activists foolishly do). At another =
level, broken links within Hinduism need to be rediscovered so that the kno=
wledgebase of our philosophy is correctly represented to sway the intellige=
ntsia. While other religions are based on "faith" in the words of a messiah=
, Hinduism has a wide-ranging and sophisticated philosophy and methods that=
 can enable anyone to become a messiah. However, the knowledge has become c=
orrupted and incomplete and some intelligent people are justified in not ha=
ving faith. At yet another level, we need to reform some social and cultura=
l aspects of Hindusm and undo some changes brought in by Kali.

  There are=
 many things to do and this will take many decades of focused and concerted=
 effort.

  *        *        *

  Personally, I have no doubt that the tim=
e of weakening (or even fall) of certain faiths has come. In the next few d=
ecades, some faiths will be weakened considerably and sanatana dharma will =
be strengthened. However, this being Kali yuga, such a change will not be p=
ermanent.

  Best regards,
  Narasimha

    Every minute that we lose in stemming this here=
sy can unfortunately turn into years of more misery for mankind. Recently a=
 wise friend, after finishing Chandi homam told me - "Why do you keep yelli=

d mannered and do not speak much - I think, he was referring to the angst a=

    Hindutv and sanatan dharm has never fought or =
converted or held crusades, yet today, we find ourselves as onlookers and c=
ommentators to our own destruction, embroiled in material pursuits of mere =
woeful existence. Some of us need to be doers to start undoing 2000 years o=
f blasphemy and try to live in a world where - to each is own - and poverty=
, misery and torture in the name of cannibalistic capitalism or socialism o=
r even communism for that matter, is abhored on earth..


    With ved and =
the knowledge of their existence , their meaning and the realization of the=

ally and nurture it so that our children are not shamed of being who they a=
re for their faith. We must lead the way because we know

really means is that every person has a right to be converted and hence the=
 right of the person to believe is conditioned  and restrictedto only belie=

what Sr Prema articulated when she so naively asserted that every person ha=

s only 2000 years old and somehow seems to be always in the company of thos=
e who invade the land of others is another dimension which needs a longer t=
reatise.

      If conversion is God's work then whose work is re-conversio=
n?  Sr Prema-the Superior General of the MoC and the whole armies of Christ=
ian missionaries involved in conversion has failed this god miserably-becau=
se their god has failed them. If conversion is God's work he seems to be ra=
ther slow and inefficient. The Catholic Church has the biggest army of nuns=
 and priests and the Christian evangelical churches have their own brand of=
 evangelists, the Southern Baptists alone as a group has nearly 100,00 care=
er missionaries in North India. Yet this God seem to be hardly having an im=
pact. This god also seem to be scared-does not direct their efforts to the =
Islamic countries. Is He afraid of terrorists?It is the simple unarmed, pov=
erty stricken tribals and passive Hindus that this God and his divine inspi=
red missionaries  target at . And yet not so easy given the enormous funds =
that flow and the armies at the disposal of this god he had to give divine
=
      inspiration to a Christian agency to massacre an unarmed poor swamiji=
 whom he found a great hurdle to spread his kingdom.
      Sr Prema has unw=
ittingly exposed the bluff of the Congress and the UPA leaders. We are told=
 that conversion is not taking place. Conversion takes different forms-glob=
ally, it is  disguised as a military coup, violence and very often a decept=
ion of service and development is the sheen given to this violent conversio=
n. Yes conversion is violence wrought on a person-to deprive the person of =
his/her dignity which according to Sr Prema every person is born with-to te=
ar the person off his affinity, his religious heritage and made him/her an =
alien is a psychological bleeding to death. Christianity and conversion are=
 two sides of the same coin. Where ever Christianity went it was bloodshed-=
destruction, and a hidden agenda of political power, economic aggrandizemen=
t, and pauperization of the victims. In the words of the Kenyatta (the Keny=
an freedom fighter) 'when the missionaries came they had the Bible and we h=
ad the land. They said, 'Let us pray,' We
      closed our eyes, when we op=
ened them, they had our lands and we had the Bible'. This is true not only =
in Africa but all over the globe. Those countries which broke away from the=
 stranglehold of Vatican became progressive-like Canada, Australia, England=
 but those colonized by the catholic powers like Spain, Portugal Mexico, Ar=
gentina, Cuba, Italy are mired in military rule and church tyranny. Christi=
anity today likes to be seen as a peace loving, compassionate religion of b=
rotherhood. But far from it-the religion was born in blood and grew in bloo=
dshed. Economic and political powers are its hidden agenda covered with ser=
vice organizations, education institutions etc.
      May be Sr Prema is to=
o na=EFve to understand and she as all nuns and priests are ignorant of chu=
rch history. These nuns and priests are brainwashed into this service and l=
ove of the poor mission.Many soon realize but then it is too late for them =
especially in India to be courageous to act and pull out. They become like =
voices in the wilderness and the church is too powerful an organization to =
fight against by ordinary innocent and truthful persons.
      This brings =
me to Sr Prema's pious wish-that she would visit Kandhamal if she receives =
'divine inspiration' and she would definitely intervene. One wonder what in=
tervention is she talking about-intervene for whom and with whom? Sr Prema =
would do a greater service if she visited the ex nun Jesme in Kerala and li=
stened to her tale of sexual harassment within the convent-how she was betr=
ayed by her own and even had to submit herself to priests to be stripped na=
ked. This is nothing new. and not a singular case but happenings that have =
been on for ages-these sexual escapades -including rape and murder have bee=
n happenings within the confines of the convents and the church compound .O=
nly when a nun is raped outside these confines then all hell breaks loose. =
Sr Prema could direct her divine inspired mission to empathize with Sr Jesm=
y and many like her and intervene with the church authorities .Sr Prema the=
 Superior General of the MoC should be aware
      that nuns are on contrac=
eptives, nuns have begotten children of bishops and priests-whole dioceses =
have been sold in the USA to pay the compensation for the sexual violation =
on alter boys by priests. A Jesuit province in the USA has declared itself =
insolvent because it cannot garner the huge funds to pay the compensation t=
o the sexual victims by its perpetrators-the priests. Be it in India or in =
other parts of the world all this pales into nothing-only Kandhamal occupie=
s and covers the whole vision of the pious Christians and Sr Prema is no ex=
ception.  I suggest that she first visit the Ashram of Swami Lakshmanada an=
d soothe the terror stricken children in whose presence the 84 year Swamiji=
 was brutally butchered. Three nuns who were with him were also killed. Wil=
l Sr Prema intervene with those murderers and see that justice is done? One=
 last request Sr Prema and her MoC work for the poor she asaserts-then why =
should the money meant for the  poor of
      this country find its way to =
the confers of Rome? It is very difficult to divest conversion and money. A=
re the accounts of the MoC being audited? If not why? Why should the lands =
and the church properties be exempted from tax and auditing? This is someth=
ing anti-national .Money cannot change its value simply because it is held =
in the hands of a particular community-All monies must be accounted for. Is=
 it not strange that those working in Minority Education institutions and d=
rawing the UGC pay scales are Income tax assesses but the priests and the n=
uns working in the same institutions are exempted from paying Income tax. T=
hey too draw the same salaries-if not more for less work-they too hold indi=
vidual bank accounts and they too draw their pensions till their death-all =
from the taxpayers monies. Why should they be exempted from paying the Inco=
me tax? This is just one area to show that the workings of the poor of whic=
h Sr Prema and all missionaries are
      engaged and other service organiz=
ations are a big money spinning business. A special vocabulary must be code=
d to understand the language of the Christians. Power is sugar coated and c=
alled service. Forgiveness is easily extended to those who hurt them-to sho=
w how compassionate they are. But they refuse to stop hurting others-they r=
efuse to stop dehumanizing the tribals and the poor. Why don't they leave t=
he poor alone? If in spite of  the enormous funds which have flowed and are=
 flowing  from abroad combined with  the government's Five Year Plans and a=
 globally  powerful God by  their side the missionaries are not able to dim=
inish  poverty, to reduce hunger and assetlessness, then is it not time to =
pause take stock of  what is fundamentally wrong? Who is swindling whom? Wh=
y are the poor kept in poverty? Why should the poor continue to be poor, wh=
y should backwardness be ever growing? Account for the work that has been s=
o far carried on and stop the
      pauperization and the plunder of this c=
ountry and its poor. Should we wait for Sr Prema and the likes of her for d=
ivine inspiration to be just logical and sensible? 
      Tailpiece-
      =
Even the Pope has lost his ability to pray that he has now assigned the Arc=

<BR>> Following are some lines from Sri =
Aurobindo's book India's 
rebirth.<BR>> <BR>> "India, the ancient Mot=
her, is indeed striving to be 
reborn, striving with agony and tears, but s=
he strives in vain. What ails her, 
she who is after all so vast and might =
be so strong? There is surely some 
enormous defect, something vital is wan=
ting in us, nor is it difficult to lay 
our finger on the spot. We have all=
 things else, but we are empty of strength, 
void of energy. We have abando=
ned Shakti and are therefore abandoned by Shakti. 
The Mother is not in our=
 hearts, in our brains, in our arms.<BR>> <BR>> Is 
it love, enthusia=
sm, Bhakti that is wanting? These are ingrained in the Indian 
nature, but =
in the absence of Shakti we cannot concentrate, we cannot direct, we 
canno=
t even preserve it. Bhakti is the leaping flame, Shakti is the fuel. If the=
 
fuel is scanty how long can the fire endure?...<BR>> <BR>> The deep=
er we 
look, the more we shall be convinced that the one thing wanting, whi=
ch we must 
strive to acquire before all others, is strength?strength physi=
cal, strength 
mental, strength moral, but above all strength spiritual whi=
ch is the one 
inexhaustible and imperishable source of all the others. If =
we have strength 
everything else will be added to us easily and naturally.=
 In the absence of 
strength we are like men in a dream who have hands but =
cannot seize or strike, 
who have feet but cannot run....<BR>> <BR>> =
What is our mother-country? It 
is not a piece of earth, nor a figure of sp=
eech, nor a fiction of the mind. It 
is a mighty Shakti, composed of the Sh=
aktis of all the millions of units that 
make up the nation, just as Bhawan=
i Mahisha Mardini sprang into being from the 
Shakti of all the millions of=
 gods assembled in one mass of force and welded 
into unity. The Shakti we =
call India, Bhawani Bharati, is the living unity of 
the Shaktis of three h=
undred million people,[3] but she is inactive, imprisoned 
in the magic cir=
cle of Tamas, the self-indulgent inertia and ignorance of her 
sons....<BR>=
> <BR>> We have to create strength where it did not exist 
before; we=
 have to change our natures, and become new men with new hearts, to be 
bor=
n again.... We need a nucleus of men in whom the Shakti is developed to its=
 
uttermost extent, in whom it fills every corner of the personality and ov=
erflows 
to fertilise the earth. These, having the fire of Bhawani in their=
 hearts and

=3D2>Ceturies ago, western invaders went about their

  <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
  <DIV><FONT =
face=3DArial size=3D2>Another thing is that sanatana dharma is broken 
  to=
day. In pursuit of modern education, the cream of Indian intelligentsia 
  =
stopped engaging in our traditional knowledge. This brought a discontinuity=
 in 
  knowledge. We have some faithful Hindus engaging in superstitious an=
d/or 
  purposeless practices. We have many priests who are corrupted by mo=
ney and 
  fame, don't do any sadhana and don't have any spiritual strength=
. Many 
  intelligent people either dissociate themselves from religion or =
follow 
  religion passively without much faith and with some shame or misg=

  the root of this is the broken knowledge and purposeless 
  p=
ractices.</FONT></DIV>

  <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Also, we have many bad practices that=
 afflict 
  Hinduism due to Kali, which need to be gotten rid of. For examp=
le, caste 
  system of today is so different from old days. The concept of =
caste mobility 
  is gone now - one would start with father's caste, b=
ut get a caste later 
  on based on one's aptitude and attitude in old days=
. For example, Valmiki was 
  a shudra by birth who lived by killing birds =
and he became a brahmana and a 
  brahmarshi later. Vishwamitra was a kshat=
riya by birth but became a brahmana 
  and a brahmarshi later and even beca=
me one of saptarshis. If lower caste and 
  untouchable Hindus feel av=
ersion to Hinduism which is exploted by 
  Christian missionaries who offer=
 money and respect to convert, <EM>some</EM> 
  fault lies with Hinduism to=
o. We need to reform casteism.</FONT></DIV>
  <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=

  <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>There are many =
things that need to be done. At 
  one level, some propaganda needs to be d=
one on the greatness of Hinduism. This 
  needs to be done with a cool, sch=
olarly and patient attitude (as opposed 
  to yelling in shrill voice =
from rooftops like some Hindutva activists 
  foolishly do). At another lev=
el, broken links within Hinduism need to be 
  rediscovered so that the kno=
wledgebase of our philosophy is correctly 
  represented to sway the intell=
igentsia. While other religions are based on 
  "faith" in the words of a m=
essiah, Hinduism has a wide-ranging and 
  sophisticated philosophy and met=
hods that can enable <EM>anyone </EM>to 
  <EM>become</EM> a messiah. Howev=
er, the knowledge has become corrupted and 
  incomplete and some intellige=
nt people are justified in not having faith. 
  At yet another level, =
we need to reform some social and cultural aspects of
