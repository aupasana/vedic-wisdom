Dear Rajarshi,

The word yoginyaadibhyaH means "to Yoginis etc" and devataabhyaH means "to 
deities". The full line means "I offer to Yoginis etc deities in the family 
of Chandi". This is an alternative to the 100+ aahutis to individual deities 
in the family. Giving all the 100 aahutis takes about 5 min if one knows all 
the names by heart and longer if one has to read from a printout. But, if 
one wants to save time, one can just offer one aahuti to all of them 
together.

Best regards,
Narasimha

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] A query on parivara devata mantra


Namaste

In the Chandi homa manual, the one line mantra for parivara debata ahuti is 
mentioned as:

om yoginy�dibhya� ca��ik� pariv�ra devat�bhyo nama� sv�h�|

Whatd does the word yoginy�dibhya� and devatbhyo mean?


In the Shiva homa manual that one line is mentioned as follows:

om sad��iva pariv�ra devat�bhya� sv�h�| sad��iva pariv�ra devat�bhya ida� na 
mama||

What is the difference in the meaning and relevance of usage of the two 
mantras for parivar devata ahuti for Chandi homa and Shiva homa?

-Regards
 Rajarshi
