understand who a "guru" is. Literally guru means dispeller of darkness. How=

everywhere. Some shadows are dark, some are darker, some are not so dark.

ess. Any person who improves one's understanding of things through his teac=
hing is *reducing* darkness, but not *dispelling* it completely. For this r=
eason, most spiritual gurus of today are not really gurus in the correct se=

for more on this dasa), Le dasa ran till 2009. Containing Moon, Mars and Ju=
piter (1st/5th lords), Le dasa made him very famous. But Cn dasa started in=
 2009 and runs till 2020. With Cn being the 8th house and its lord afflicti=
ng the 9th house and 1st/5th lords, this dasa shows fall from dharma and fa=
ll from fame. With this being a long-term dasa, I am afraid he cannot recov=
er from this sex scandal. I am afraid he is finished as far as fame is conc=
erned. His best is over.
>
> In D-20, lagna lord Venus, yogakaraka (4th/5th=
 lord Saturn) and 9th lord Mercury are together in the 8th house in a Venus=
ian sign. This is a very powerful rajayoga in the 8th house. Hence I do not=
 think he is a fake sadhaka. IMHO, he is a good sadhaka who was blessed wit=
h genuine mystical experiences (8th). However, AK Mercury is closely afflic=
ted by GK Saturn within 2 deg in Taurus (in D-20 of course). AK shows Self =
and GK shows weaknesses and vulnerabilities and this shows someone vulnerab=
le to a fall.
>
> As per Chara dasa of D-20, Sg dasa ran from 1989 to 2001.=
 This is the 3rd house of Gurupadesa (7th from 9th) containing Jupiter in m=
oolatrikona. It is also the 8th house of austerities from AK. He probably d=
id some intense austerities and received blessings from guru(s). Then Cp da=
sa from 2001 to 2009. This is the 4th house of direction and properties in =
D-20. Being the 9th house of dharma from AK, it makes one fulfil one's dhar=
ma spiritually (D-20). Being the 4th house, he built an organization. The n=
ext dasa is Aq till 2018. Aq is owned and aspected by GK Saturn and can giv=
e the results of GK afflicting AK. Being the 10th from AK, it shows individ=
ualized Self (AK) working actively. Instead of becoming detached, individua=
lized Self is becoming active. I am afraid he is not calm as cucumber inter=
nally, however he may behave externally. His egosense is concerned about it=
s future, becoming attached and working hard in self-interest. Then Pi dasa=
 during 2018-2021 and Ar dasa during 2021-2032 can give the best experience=
s of his spiritual life, as Ar is the 12th from AK Mercury and its lord Mar=
s is in Pi. Worship of Valli Sahita Subrahmanya (12th lord from AK is Mars =
and with Moon) is recommended for him for more detachment.

> Overall, he =
is a sadhaka who did some austerities, experienced some things, became famo=

to come.

> Sex is a human weakness and an ac=
tivity that increases the binding of self-awareness to the physical body. I=
t is not without a reason that many religious traditions value celibacy. Ho=
wever, just as mowed grass can come back after the winter if roots remain u=
nder the ground, similarly desires can come back after decades of celibacy =
if the root conditioning remains under the surface. One can chant "all is g=
od, all is god" for decades, encounter a beautiful naked body after decades=
 of celibacy and see in it an object that provokes certain impulses, rather=
 than seeing the same "god" that is in "all". Staying away from something d=
oes not necessarily remove liking/disliking for it.
>
> A tantrika may put =
oneself in intimate company that normally provokes certain impulses and con=
sciously try to chant mantras and overcome the impulses. There is nothing i=
nherently impure in a naked body, but the impulses it evokes may take mind =
away from god and to physical gratification and hence are "impure". To cut =
down on the production of those impulses, that imagery has to be associated=
 in the mind with something else. The goal of so-called tantrik sex is not =
having sex, but to resist temptation. If one is able to resist temptation, =
chant mantras and focus mind on mantra/god even in the intimate company of =
a naked partner, seeing such imagery in future may not evoke impure impulse=
s, but make one think of a mantra or god. Thus, tantrik sex is not really s=
ex and is ironically about maintaining celibacy (even mentally!) in tough p=
hysical conditions. It is not for all and only for those who have a reasona=
ble level of self-control and want to perfect it further. One needs a capab=
le partner.
