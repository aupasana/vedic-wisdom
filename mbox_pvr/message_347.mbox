Namaste Madam,
 
I will be honest and make a bold statement and ask elders =
to forgive me if they disagree my strong views.
 
> Is this something women=
 practice or is this practice exclusive
> to men?  Like so many other ritua=
ls in Hinduism?
 
This is typically practiced by men only, but I see no rea=
son why women cannot do it. In fact, if you see the explanation I have give=
n for why this should be done and how it works, you will see that it applie=
s to men and women.
 
There are some differences. Women have only XX chromo=
somes while men have XY chromosomes. A man is more likely to get the genes =
from father's side ancestors than mother's side ancestors. In the case of w=
omen, the probability calculation is different. In the mantras I gave, fath=
er's ancestors are covered first and then come mother's ancestors. Perhaps =
the order can be switched for women. But for a possible change of order bas=
ed on probabilities, the procedure and mantras given apply to both men and =
women.
 
The bottomloine is that both paternal line and maternal line karma=
s affect both men and women. The kaarrmik predispositions based on the rina=
 to various ancestors and the blockages created by them are equally importa=
nt for men and women in order to progress materially and spiritually.
 
In =
the old days, men did so much spiritual sadhana, so many rituals and so muc=
h tapascharya that women did not need to do anything. Just run the house, g=
et groceries, cook, serve food and your husband builds enough spiritual ban=
k balance for both of you. But things are not the same anymore! Most men to=
day are worldly people and don't do enough spiritual sadhana for themselves=
, let alone for their wives!
 
Given this situation, women cannot rely on h=
usbands for spiritual progress. I strongly advocate that women should be al=
lowed to perform rituals like homam, tarpanam etc for their own spiritual e=
volution. I know some ladies who are performing Mahaganapathi homam using t=
he manual on my website now and enjoying it.
 
If these rituals are not don=
e during the monthly periods time, that is sufficient.
 
Just ignore the in=
structions on the sacred thread changes. In case you are actually wearing a=
 sacred thread, reverse my directions, which are for men.
 
Even today, the=
re are some groups where women wear a sacred thread, do veda mantras and do=
 yajnas. For example, near Shirdi, a great yogi called Upasani maharaj (con=
temporary of Sai Baba) advocated this and started a veda pathasala for wome=
n and taught them vedic chanting and rituals such as yajnam! He was born as=
 an orthodox Brahmin, mastered four vedas (!) and upanishads and then exper=
ienced Brahman. After experiencing, he became open-minded and worked agains=
t the prejudices in mainstream orthodox society. Sai Baba once declared "Up=
asani is God Himself. Today let us do pooja to Upasani"!
 
I will encourage=
 all interested ladies to do this ritual.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

  Sri Narisimha Rao-
  Thank you for sending this out.  I=

 this for years without understanding the exact meaning and purpose.
  Is t=

  Namaste friends,

  Now three detailed pitri tarpana =
manuals are available on the internet. They are appropriate even for a novi=
ce and explain clearly the details of pitri tarpana. The mantras are simple=
, the materials needed are few and it does not take too long.

  Homam (fir=
e ritual) and pitri tarpanas (water ritual) are two of the most important r=
ituals of Hinduism and worth performing regularly. They cleanse a person, r=
emove various obstacles in material and spiritual lives and speed up spirit=
ual evolution. An aspirant desiring spiritual progress should take advantag=
e of them regularly. More about the philosophy of pitri tarpana is explaine=
d below, where I reproduced an extract from the manual.

  Please download =
the manuals from

  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana

  There are thr=
ee manuals - one with the regular procedure (taking 30-45 min), one with a =
short procedure (taking 12-20 min) and one with a super-short procedure (ta=
king 5-8 min).

  Please feel free to pass this word around to interested p=
eople. I hope this information reaches with Her blessings as many intereste=
d souls as possible.

  By the way, there is an important solar eclipse in =
a few hours. It is a great time to perform pitri tarpanas. Actually, it is =
a great time to perform many spiritual sadhanas.

  Best regards,
  Narasim=

  External rituals are meant to create the internal visualization n=
eeded to affect desirable internal changes in the long run. For example, on=
e offers a full coconut into fire as poornaahuti (complete offering) at the=
 end of a homam (fire ritual). This is symbolic of surrendering one's head =
or ego (sense of I-ness) to god and burning it in the fire of wisdom and be=
coming free from ego. As one keeps engaging in this act again and again, th=
e visualization becomes stronger and stronger and ego is slowly reduced.


=
  One important ritual of Hinduism is tarpana. Tarpana means "satisfying" o=
r "satiating". One acknowledges the debt one has to devas (gods), rishis (s=
ages) and pitris (ancestral manes) and tries to satisfy them using this rit=
ual. Just as gods are invoked in fire in a homam, pitris are invoked in wat=
er in this ritual, then held in the palm and released in a specific way con=
ducive to freeing them.


  One owes a lot to one's parents and ancestors. =
In modern scientific terms, one owes all of one's genetic characteristics t=
o one's parents and ancestors. Each ancestor is actually present in the per=
son as a genetic characteristic. In karmik terms, one inherits some karmas =
of one's parents and ancestors and each ancestor is actually present in the=
 person as a kaarmik predisposition. The latter approach obviously extends =
to multiple lives and some karmik predisposition is inherited from the ance=
stors from a past life too, though they may not be related to one in this l=
ife.


  By thinking of the deceased ancestors with gratitude and trying to=
 give them an emancipation, one is actually trying to free oneself from var=
ious kaarmic predispositions that one has as a result of the rina (karmik d=
ebt) with several people. One can view this as an external event of satisfy=
ing and emancipating an external entity (a pitri). Alternately, one can vie=
w this as an internal event of satisfying and releasing an internal kaarmik=
 predisposition. Ultimately, it is the latter. However, one needs to extern=
alize first and perform external rituals, while thinking of what it means i=
nternally. This builds up one's visualization and slowly brings about inter=
nal changes and eventually the desired internal change itself.


  Two exte=
rnal spiritual sadhanas are particularly powerful, useful and recommended f=
or every person desirous of fast spiritual progress:



    1.. Homam (fire=
 ritual): Gods are invoked in fire and satisfied with offerings with mantra=
s. Please see the homam website at 
  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam =
for more. In the long run, a regular practice of this ritual increases the =
subtle fire burning inside one's subtle body, burns various impediments to =
spiritual progress and gives clarity, focus and stability to the mind. 


 =
 Tarpana (water ritual): Gods, sages and manes are invoked in water and sat=
isfied with emancipation given to them. In the long run, a regular practice=
 of this ritual increases the release of various kaarmik predispositions an=
d weaknesses that are blocking one's spiritual and material progress. 


  =
This document describes the procedure of pitri tarpana with the relevant ma=
ntras using a simple approach. This document is the regular procedure. Ther=
e are also documents giving a short procedure and a super-short procedure f=
or the benefit of those with time constraints or problem with Sanskrita lan=
guage. Download them from

  <P><FONT face=3DArial>External rituals=
 are meant to create the internal 
  visualization needed to affect desirab=
le internal changes in the long run. For 
  example, one offers a full coco=
nut into fire as poornaahuti (complete 
  offering) at the end of a homam (=
fire ritual). This is symbolic of 
  surrendering one's head or ego (sense =
of I-ness) to god and burning it in the 
  fire of wisdom and becoming free=
 from ego. As one keeps engaging in this act 
  again and again, the visual=
ization becomes stronger and stronger and ego is 
  slowly reduced.</FONT><=
/P>
  <P><FONT face=3DArial></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face=3DArial>One importa=
nt ritual of Hinduism is tarpana. Tarpana means 
  "satisfying" or "satiati=
ng". One acknowledges the debt one has to devas 
  (gods), rishis (sages) a=
nd pitris (ancestral manes) and tries to satisfy them 
  using this ritual.=
 Just as gods are invoked in fire in a homam, pitris are 
  invoked in wate=
r in this ritual, then held in the palm and released in a 
  specific way c=
onducive to freeing them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=3DArial>One owes a lot to one's parents and ancestors. In mod=
ern 
  scientific terms, one owes all of one's genetic characteristics to o=
ne's 
  parents and ancestors. Each ancestor is actually present in the per=
son as a 
  genetic characteristic. In karmik terms, one inherits some karm=
as of one's 
  parents and ancestors and each ancestor is actually present =
in the person as a 
  kaarmik predisposition. The latter approach obviously=
 extends to multiple 
  lives and some karmik predisposition is inherited f=
rom the ancestors from a 
  past life too, though they may not be related t=
o one in this life.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face=3DArial></FONT></P>
  <P><FO=
NT face=3DArial>By thinking of the deceased ancestors with gratitude and 
 =
 trying to give them an emancipation, one is actually trying to free onesel=
f 
  from various kaarmic predispositions that one has as a result of the r=
ina 
  (karmik debt) with several people. One can view this as an external =
event of 
  satisfying and emancipating an external entity (a pitri). Alter=
nately, one can 
  view this as an internal event of satisfying and releasi=
ng an internal kaarmik 
  predisposition. Ultimately, it is the latter. How=
ever, one needs to 
  externalize first and perform external rituals, while=
 thinking of what it 
  means internally. This builds up one's visualizatio=
n and slowly brings about 
  internal changes and eventually the desired in=
ternal change itself.</FONT></P>
