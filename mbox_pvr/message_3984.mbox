Namaste friends,
 
My 2 cents on curses and curse relieving incantations can be read in message 3380 from the archives:
 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3380
Curses on mantras (Re: ram ram)
 
BTW, thinking of rishis who were adept in a mantra, before chanting the mantra, is always a great idea. Rishis are very very very powerful beings. Even a very very very minute amount of their grace coming to you during your spiritual endeavors will elevate you like anything.
 
Apart from rishis associated with a mantra, one can also mentally pray to the rishi(s) of one's gotra before meditation with any veda mantra (or any other mantra).
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

Yes, as Narasimha pointed out, in some cases, God may take away certain things to make your spiritual journey faster, but, that is not really a punishment.
