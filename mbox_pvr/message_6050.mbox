Dear Biswajit,

Why experiment with Bagalamukhi mantras? And that too based=
 on astrology? 

If you want spiritual progress alone, forget astrologicall=
y trying to judge 
spiritual things for some time and=C2=A0focus only on ho=
mas. Meditate more when the 
fire is burning. Try and make sure that the up=
perpart of your body is as still 
as possible when the performing the homa/=
meditating. Keep the spinal cord 
straight. Only movement should be hand mo=
vements for ahutis. Discipline your 
self into following this, even if the =
mind wavers here and there. Eventually it 
will bear good result. Additiona=
lly, if you want, then whenever you sit on the 
floor try and sit with your=
 back straight. This can slowly become a habit.

I can tell you my personal=
 experiences when I had started homas for the first 
time. Before that I ha=
d been chanting a certain mantra of Bhairava for nearly a 
year. Then I dec=
ided to experiment with fire rituals. This was in 2007. I did 
not know Nar=
asimha or Manish or even the existence of this forum. Till then I 
had seen=
 only one homa in my whole life, a priest was performing a Vishnu homa 
and=
 I was sitting in the crowd of people.

So without much of an idea of how t=
o go about things, I bought an iron kunda 
from a blacksmith, got some wood=
, some ghee and started of with the experiments 
of giving ahutis of the Bh=
airava mantra in fire.=C2=A0Around my 11th homa, while it 
was going on, I =
felt a sudden pain in my leg. The heat of the fire had singed my 
leg. I wa=
s sitting exactly at the same distance from the fire as I had always 
sat a=
nd I still sit. I got up from the homa, there was a little bit of pain, I 
=
ignored it. A day later the leg started swelling, next day it turned blue a=
nd 
the 4th day I could not walk. My friends took me to a local doctor who =

immediately cut open the skin and started digging out the flesh with a sca=
lpel, 
without anesthesia. I was screaming like mad from pain. He advised t=
hat I should 
be taken to a bigger hospital immediately. The doctors there =
decided I needed an 
operation. Obviously, I was very scared and had=C2=A0n=
o clue what was happening and 
why it was happening. I started praying ment=
ally, eventually a senior doctor 
came and said he would use some intravene=
ous antibiotics and see for a couple of 
hours if there is any improvement.=
 If not, operation is a must. Thankfully it 
worked, but I had to stay in t=
he hospital for 4 days and for the next one month 
I could not walk properl=
y.=C2=A0 I have a permanent mark on my right leg from that 
incident.

Afte=
r that I did not go close to the homa kunda for a few months. However, I 
l=
ove fire and fire rituals. Eventually I came across this forum and with som=
e 
guidance from Narasimha I started doing Bhairava homas again. But I kept=
 doing 
it in an iron kunda. After sometime=C2=A0suddenly one day during ho=
ma I found myself 
surrounded by spiders and scorpions. This was quite dist=
urbing, specifically 
because I have a dislike for spiders. Then a thought =
came to me that I must 
change the homa kunda. I bought a copper one and ev=
erything was fine from that 
day onwards. 


After I had completed my 85th =
homa of Bhairava, I was sitting at night and 
meditating. I saw something -=
 or maybe my mind projected something - which 
almost kept me transfixed fo=
r half an hour. I could not get up from my seat even 
if I wanted to. That =
time I also got a thought very strongly that I must stop 
the Bhairava homa=
s for now and worship a female deity. About 15 days from that 
experience, =
I got a call from Manish for the first time. He told me was to stop 
the Bh=
airava homas immediately and start Chandipath. He said, "you have been 
dai=
ling His (Bhairava's) number, line lag gya hai, but you are just not prepar=
ed 
to take His energy". If Bhairava appears infornt of you, you may get a =
complete 
nervous breakdown. Then slowly I started Chandi homas with Manish=
's guidance. 
Later on I have done Bhairava homas and had good meditations.=
 I still sit at the 
same distance from the fire, and often light a huge fi=
re, but never did I 
experience anything like what I went through=C2=A0afte=
r the=C2=A0first few Bhairava homas.

The point is simple. An Ugra deity=C2=
=A0can test you to your limits. A milder 
deity=C2=A0won't test you to the =
limits. A deity knows very well where you limit 
lies.=C2=A0There is a joll=
y good reason why our Rishis have classified different 
deities differently=
. And Baglamukhi or Narasimha are very ugra forms. It is not 
that there ar=
n't people who worship these forms, but you or I may not be able to 
do it.=
 It is=C2=A0better to choose what is practical and doable.

Patience is ver=
y important. Unless you have done at least 108 homas of Ganapati, 
what is =
the use of shifting to another form? And if you have done 108, then 
focus =
on making each homa to be a unique experience. Meditate more, extent the 
h=
oma for a longer period. Try out doing a 2/3 hours Ganapati homa when you c=
an 
find time. See the effects yourself. Give more than one supari in the h=
oma.=C2=A0 In 
one shot Ganapati=C2=A0can take your normal=C2=A0mind to a d=
ifferent plane completely. The 
ganas are the sense inputs, and=C2=A0Ganapa=
ti is the lord of these. He can cut off 
the sense inputs and pull the mind=
 inwards very easily. 


Decide what is most convenient for you. But unders=
tand the facts involved before 
experimenting. Achieve some success/communi=
on in the worship of one form=C2=A0before 
you decide to move on to another=
.

=C2=A0
My comments were generic and not just direct=
ed at Biswajit. There are a lot of 
people worshipping Mahavidyas without a=
 good understanding. Even if one believes 
one is doing a sadhana for a "sa=
atwik desire", any attachments one has at the 
mundane level can affect one=
's intentions at the sub-conscious level!
=C2=A0
Moreover, the question is =
not just of whether the desire is saattwik or not, but 
of whether one is r=
eady for a specific path for fulfilling that desire. If a 
barefooted perso=
n is not ready for a path with a lot of sharp thorns and nails, 
one may ha=
ve to take a longer path that has fewer nails or thorns. Each path 
will fi=
nally reach the same place anyway. The wisdom lies in picking a path 
where=
 one will not stop in the middle.

If =
one surrenders really and fully, then yes, one is in safe hands. But then, =

one will not worry about a stolen motorbike or troubles at work. Even if f=
ar 
worse things happen, one will not worry.
=C2=A0
Instead of submitting o=
neself to a very tough taskmaster who demands perfect 
surrender, and then =
struggling with an imperfect surrender, it is better in some 
cases to subm=
it oneself to a more lenient taskmaster who can deal with imperfect 
surren=
der (and slowly works on improving it).
=C2=A0
Mahavidyas were worshipped b=
y very few sadhakas in the old days. People of today 
know less about them =
and yet more try to worship them.

<DIV>Dear Biswajit,</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DI=
V>Why experiment with Bagalamukhi mantras? And that too based on astrology?=
 </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>If you want spiritual progress alone, forget=
 astrologically trying to judge spiritual things for some time and foc=
us only on homas. Meditate more when the fire is burning. Try and make sure=
 that the upperpart of your body is as still as possible when the performin=
g the homa/meditating. Keep the spinal cord straight. Only movement should =
be hand movements for ahutis. Discipline your self into following this, eve=
n if the mind wavers here and there. Eventually it will bear good result. A=
dditionally, if you want, then whenever you sit on the floor try and sit wi=
th your back straight. This can slowly become a habit.</DIV>
<DIV> </D=
IV>
<DIV>I can tell you my personal experiences when I had started homas fo=
r the first time. Before that I had been chanting a certain mantra of Bhair=
ava for nearly a year. Then I decided to experiment with fire rituals. This=
 was in 2007. I did not know Narasimha or Manish or even the existence of t=
his forum. Till then I had seen only one homa in my whole life, a priest wa=
s performing a Vishnu homa and I was sitting in the crowd of people.</DIV>
=
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>So without much of an idea of how to go about things=
, I bought an iron kunda from a blacksmith, got some wood, some ghee and st=
arted of with the experiments of giving ahutis of the Bhairava mantra in fi=
re. Around my 11th homa, while it was going on, I felt a sudden pain i=
n my leg. The heat of the fire had singed my leg. I was sitting exactly at =
the same distance from the fire as I had always sat and I still sit. I got =
up from the homa, there was a little bit of pain, I ignored it. A day later=
 the leg started swelling, next day it turned blue and the 4th day I could =
not walk. My friends took me to a local doctor who immediately cut open the=
 skin and started digging out the flesh with a scalpel, without anesthesia.=
 I was screaming like mad from pain. He advised that I should be taken to a=
 bigger hospital immediately. The doctors there decided I needed an operati=
on. Obviously, I was very scared and had no clue what was happening an=
d why it
 was happening. I started praying mentally, eventually a senior do=
ctor came and said he would use some intraveneous antibiotics and see for a=
 couple of hours if there is any improvement. If not, operation is a must. =
Thankfully it worked, but I had to stay in the hospital for 4 days and for =
the next one month I could not walk properly.  I have a permanent mark=
 on my right leg from that incident.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>After tha=
t I did not go close to the homa kunda for a few months. However, I love fi=
re and fire rituals. Eventually I came across this forum and with some guid=
ance from Narasimha I started doing Bhairava homas again. But I kept doing =
it in an iron kunda. After sometime suddenly one day during homa I fou=
nd myself surrounded by spiders and scorpions. This was quite disturbing, s=
pecifically because I have a dislike for spiders. Then a thought came to me=
 that I must change the homa kunda. I bought a copper one and everything wa=
s fine from that day onwards. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>After I had com=
pleted my 85th homa of Bhairava, I was sitting at night and meditating. I s=
aw something - or maybe my mind projected something - which almost kept me =
transfixed for half an hour. I could not get up from my seat even if I want=
ed to. That time I also got a thought very strongly that I must stop the Bh=
airava homas for now and worship a female deity. About 15 days from that ex=
perience, I got a call from Manish for the first time. He told me was to st=
op the Bhairava homas immediately and start Chandipath. He said, "you have =
been dailing His (Bhairava's) number, line lag gya hai, but you are just no=
t prepared to take His energy". If Bhairava appears infornt of you, you may=
 get a complete nervous breakdown. Then slowly I started Chandi homas with =
Manish's guidance. Later on I have done Bhairava homas and had good meditat=
ions. I still sit at the same distance from the fire, and often light a hug=
e fire, but never did I experience anything like
 what I went through =
after the first few Bhairava homas.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>The p=
oint is simple. An Ugra deity can test you to your limits. A milder de=
ity won't test you to the limits. A deity knows very well where you li=
mit lies. There is a jolly good reason why our Rishis have classified =
different deities differently. And Baglamukhi or Narasimha are very ugra fo=
rms. It is not that there arn't people who worship these forms, but you or =
I may not be able to do it. It is better to choose what is practical a=
nd doable.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Patience is very important. Unless =
you have done at least 108 homas of Ganapati, what is the use of shifting t=
o another form? And if you have done 108, then focus on making each homa to=
 be a unique experience. Meditate more, extent the homa for a longer period=
. Try out doing a 2/3 hours Ganapati homa when you can find time. See the e=
ffects yourself. Give more than one supari in the homa.  In one shot G=
anapati can take your normal mind to a different plane completely=
. The ganas are the sense inputs, and Ganapati is the lord of these. H=
e can cut off the sense inputs and pull the mind inwards very easily. </DIV=
>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Decide what is most convenient for you. But unders=
tand the facts involved before experimenting. Achieve some success/communio=
n in the worship of one form before you decide to move on to another. =
</DIV>

in those are all part & parcel of life. Even without Homam, one may exp=

<FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D3 face=3DVerdana>> I understand your insist=
ence and your prudent advice to worship Soumya Devatas and I agree to your =
logic which is most probably out of your experiences, however I also think =
that Ugra Devata should not be that fearful while Soumya Devatas are not th=
at Goody-goody. Ultimately, it is all about attraction/liking for a particu=
lar deity. It is my personal view that one needs to decide upon a Homam of =
a deity (Ugra or Soumya Devata or Ugra-Soumya in external Nature) to which =
one feels most attracted and then forget about the rest. It would be a dest=
abilizing effect on mind of a person to start judging and relating day to d=
ay experiences with homam. The chosen deity can be Maha-Ganapati or Chandi =
or Krishna or Shiva or Hanuman or any other deity. Once person starts surre=
ndering to the chosen deity, one is in safe hands. Even if things starts go=
ing wrong, one need not despair and should keep faith till
 it is impossibl=
e because if God exist, there never would be a breaking point and that hold=
s true for all of us whether we have families to look after or not. </FONT>=

 I completely tend to agree and hence repeat for benefits of others that Ga=
napati is not a Lower devata. He is capable of everything. If one has a gre=
at liking for him, one can keep on performing his homam without need of swi=
tching. Actually to switch from Maha-Ganapati Homam to some other deity is =
NOT changing of Levels (especially from Lower to upper) which some may thin=
k. </FONT></DIV>
