Namaste,
=C2=A0
To add to my query,=C2=A0a good number of=C2=A0religions ex=
plicitly prohibit idol worship. If the underlying truth is one, how can it =
be so contradictory? 
=C2=A0
I can understand that a Idol may contain a pre=
sence created by human imagination which maynot have a divine link. Not eve=
rybody is a Ramakrishna who can actually call Mahakali into an Idol.
=C2=A0=

But then, what ever the idol may contain, postive/negative/creative/destru=
ction, if someone prays to it with devotion, assuming that it is reaching G=
od, is it=C2=A0not enough? After all God is finally tax collecter of prayer=
s. Does not all prayer finally reach God, irrespective of whether a divine =
presence is there or not there infront?
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
I would like to menti=
on a small incident here about someone I know well.=C2=A0There was a certai=
n individual, who=C2=A0whenever=C2=A0he would go to Calcutta.=C2=A0he would=
 take time out to=C2=A0go and meditate in the hall infornt of the idol at t=
he Kaalighat temple.=C2=A0Once=C2=A0he reached the temple around 8 pm=C2=A0=
and sat there trying to mediate for about 2 hours.=C2=A0His mind=C2=A0sudde=
nly became very focused, he=C2=A0*thought*=C2=A0he saw some deep blue light=
s (probably just his imagination) - but there was a=C2=A0distinct feeling o=
f great joy in him. His=C2=A0mind become without thoughts as if there was n=
o worry in the whole world, everything was perfect.=C2=A0 Also a strong, sa=
nguine feeling came into him that=C2=A0he needed to worship the Goddess. As=
=C2=A0he came out=C2=A0he found that his=C2=A0shoes were missing, so=C2=A0h=
e walked more than a kilometer distance bare feet though an extremely dirty=
 road=C2=A0but all=C2=A0he felt was a deep joy. Nothing was actually regist=
ering in=C2=A0his mind that night, except for an overwhelming
 joy, as he=
=C2=A0said later on. Bottomline: a nice spiritual experience.
=C2=A0
Some=
=C2=A0months=C2=A0later=C2=A0he ended up meeting a very spiritual person wh=
o instructed him about worshipping the Goddess.=C2=A0=C2=A0He strongly beli=
eves that night at the temple and his meeting with the person was related. =
Interestingly, even that spiritual=C2=A0person=C2=A0told him that there is =
probably no divine presence inside the idol at Kaalighat temple.
=C2=A0
Now=
 my question is, if the idol at the Kaalighat temple did not have a divine =
presence why did=C2=A0this person=C2=A0suddenly have such a nice meditation=
 there?=C2=A0=C2=A0Does it=C2=A0mean that=C2=A0finally it is only the devot=
ion of the devotee which counts for spiritual energy inside a temple, irres=
pective of whether the idol has any energy=C2=A0at all?

Namaste,
=C2=A0
If an incense stick with =
intense smell was burnt in a place, the air there will be filled with that =
smell long after the stick completely burns. However, eventually the smell =
will be gone! How long it takes to disappear depends on how strong the smel=
l was when the stick was burnt.
=C2=A0
Similarly, when a great saint medita=
tes in a place, the air there will be filled with that saint's spiritual en=
ergy. Even after the saint leaves that place or leaves earth altogether, th=
at energy will linger there. Slowly it becomes weak and disappears.

In many famous temples these days, priests have become commercial and do no=

It is my humble opinion that =
some famous temples do not have much divine presence today, though I do not=
 want to name any names. At the same time, some not-so-well- known temples =
seem to have a powerful divine presence.
=C2=A0
I was very impressed with t=
he=C2=A0Krishna temple in Mayapur (ISKCON head office is there), Girnar hil=
ls in Gujarat and Arunachalam hills in Tiruvannamalai (Ramana Maharshi's pl=
ace). There is a tremendous amount of spiritual energy in those places. The=
re are several temples where the idol is practically alive. For example, ev=
en 123 years after Ramakrishna Paramahamsa left, the Kaali idol at Dakshine=
shwar is "alive". I did not get the same impression at the famous Kalighat =
temple which is also in Calcutta.
=C2=A0
There was one small temple in Tami=
l Nadu that I was taken to by a priest who took me to visit about 30 temple=
s all over Tamil Nadu before we did the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 20=
06. I never heard of that temple before and it seemed like a small temple. =
The name of the=C2=A0form of the divine Mother=C2=A0present there was a Tam=
il language name and I did not understand it. I do not even remember the na=
me now. But, when I closed my eyes and started meditating with my mantra in=
 front of the idol, I was dazzled by a vision of a very fierce goddess whos=
e face was emiting rays like Sun. I felt that there was a powerful presence=
 there. Unfortunately, I do not remember the name of the place or the godde=
ss, but it is a temple without roof over the goddess. They tried to put a r=
oof over the goddess a few times, but the roof came down in a fire accident=
 each time and they finally decided that the goddess likes open air and no =
roof. Though we spent only 5 min and left
 in a hurry, I was very pleased w=
ith that temple. Someone from Tamil Nadu probably knows the name of the tem=
ple and goddess.
=C2=A0
Like this, I am sure there are many temples with a =
powerful divine presence across India.
=C2=A0
Apart from the Kaali temple a=
t Dakshineshwar, one of my best experiences when meditating was at the Kris=
hna/Vitthal temple at Aalandi near Pune. I am sure that Jnaneshwar Maharaj =
is still meditating in the underground chamber there.

=C2=A0
Even the middle of a busy road in India is better for meditating t=
han a temple in USA. These western countries are so filled with rajas and t=
amas. There is rajas in India too, but there is a good amount of sattwa the=
re. Thus, any temple in India will be a good place to meditate, but my view=
 is that there is not much left at *some* temples. But some temples are rea=
lly good.
=C2=A0
If one has a chance to spend a few months doing spiritual =
sadhana near a temple, I suggest the following:
=C2=A0
Mayapur, Dakshineshw=
ar, Puri and Kamakhya in east India, Kurtaalam, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam=
 hills)=C2=A0and Narayana=C2=A0vanam (near Tirupati)=C2=A0in south India, S=
hirdi, Aalandi, Dwaraka=C2=A0and Girnar mountains (Junagadh) in west India,=
 Varanasi, Vrindavan and Hrishikesh in north India and Srisailam and Mantra=
layam=C2=A0and Ujjain in central India.
=C2=A0
There are many other good pl=
aces, but the above come to my mind. Visiting a temple once is one thing an=
d staying there for several months while maintaining a simple lifestyle and=
 doing a spiritual sadhana (like homam or japam) there is quite another.

Respected Narsimhaj=

I would like to know your opinion on holy places (famous temples etc)=

nd Shree Tirupati temple, as far as spiritual sadhana is concerned. Please =
share your views on this.
