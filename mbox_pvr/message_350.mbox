I was reading the Pitri Tarpan manual and I have af=
ew questions. You have advised that the Tarpan shouldnt be performed inside=
 the house. Is there any specific reason for it. As we are living in city a=
nd cannot find river to perform the tarpan then how can we do it.
=A0
Also =
you say that it can be performed on eclipse or amavasya days inside the hou=
se. What time is best suited on these days to perform it.
=A0
Thank you

Namaste friends,
=A0
Now three detailed =
pitri tarpana manuals are available on the internet. They are appropriate e=
ven for a novice and explain clearly the details of pitri tarpana. The mant=
ras are simple, the materials needed are few and it does not take too long.=

=A0
Homam (fire ritual) and pitri tarpanas (water ritual) are two of the m=
ost important rituals of Hinduism and worth performing regularly. They clea=
nse a person, remove various obstacles in material and spiritual lives and =
speed up spiritual evolution. An aspirant desiring spiritual progress shoul=
d take advantage of them regularly. More about the philosophy of pitri tarp=
ana is explained below, where I reproduced an extract from the manual.
=A0
=
Please download the manuals from
=A0
http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpa=
na
=A0
There are three manuals - one with the regular procedure (taking 30-=
45 min), one with a short procedure (taking 12-20 min) and one with a super=
-short procedure (taking 5-8 min).
=A0
Please feel free to pass this word a=
round to interested people. I hope this information reaches with Her blessi=
ngs as many interested souls as possible.
=A0
By the way, there is an impor=
tant solar eclipse in a few hours. It is a great time to perform pitri tarp=
anas. Actually, it is a great time to perform many spiritual sadhanas.
=A0

Best regards,
Narasimha

External rituals are meant to create=
 the internal visualization needed to affect desirable internal changes in =
the long run. For example, one offers a full coconut into fire as poornaahu=
ti (complete offering) at the end of a homam (fire ritual). This is symboli=
c of surrendering one=A2s head or ego (sense of I-ness) to god and burning =
it in the fire of wisdom and becoming free from ego. As one keeps engaging =
in this act again and again, the visualization becomes stronger and stronge=
r and ego is slowly reduced.

One important ritual of Hinduism is tarpana. =
Tarpana means "satisfying" or "satiating". One acknowledges the debt one ha=
s to devas (gods), rishis (sages) and pitris (ancestral manes) and tries to=
 satisfy them using this ritual. Just as gods are invoked in fire in a homa=
m, pitris are invoked in water in this ritual, then held in the palm and re=
leased in a specific way conducive to freeing them.

One owes a lot to one=
=A2s parents and ancestors. In modern scientific terms, one owes all of one=
=A2s genetic characteristics to one=A2s parents and ancestors. Each ancesto=
r is actually present in the person as a genetic characteristic. In karmik =
terms, one inherits some karmas of one=A2s parents and ancestors and each a=
ncestor is actually present in the person as a kaarmik predisposition. The =
latter approach obviously extends to multiple lives and some karmik predisp=
osition is inherited from the ancestors from a past life too, though they m=
ay not be related to one in this life.

By thinking of the deceased ancesto=
rs with gratitude and trying to give them an emancipation, one is actually =
trying to free oneself from various kaarmic predispositions that one has as=
 a result of the rina (karmik debt) with several people. One can view this =
as an external event of satisfying and emancipating an external entity (a p=
itri). Alternately, one can view this as an internal event of satisfying an=
d releasing an internal kaarmik predisposition. Ultimately, it is the latte=
r. However, one needs to externalize first and perform external rituals, wh=
ile thinking of what it means internally. This builds up one=A2s visualizat=
ion and slowly brings about internal changes and eventually the desired int=
ernal change itself.

Two external spiritual sadhanas are particularly powe=
rful, useful and recommended for every person desirous of fast spiritual pr=
ogress:



Homam (fire ritual): Gods are invoked in fire and satisfied with=
 offerings with mantras. Please see the homam website at http://www.VedicAs=
t rologer.org/ homam for more. In the long run, a regular practice of this =
ritual increases the subtle fire burning inside one=A2s subtle body, burns =
various impediments to spiritual progress and gives clarity, focus and stab=
ility to the mind.


Tarpana (water ritual): Gods, sages and manes are invo=
ked in water and satisfied with emancipation given to them. In the long run=
, a regular practice of this ritual increases the release of various kaarmi=
k predispositions and weaknesses that are blocking one=A2s spiritual and ma=
terial progress.


This document describes the procedure of pitri tarpana w=
ith the relevant mantras using a simple approach. This document is the regu=
lar procedure. There are also documents giving a short procedure and a supe=
r-short procedure for the benefit of those with time constraints or problem=
 with Sanskrita language. Download them from http://www.VedicAst rologer.or=
g/ tarpana.
