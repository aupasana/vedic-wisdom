Namaste,
 
It hardly matters how people address me.
 
A very short bare-bon=
es Chandi homam can be done in one hour, if one does only 13 chapters and a=
 small count of the Chandu moola mantra and one is proficient in reading sa=
ptashati. If one is not fluent in the text, even bare-bones Chandi homam ca=
n take 1.5-2 hours. As things like kavacha, argala, keelaka, raatri sooktam=
, devi sooktam, parivaara devata aahutis etc are added on, it can go upto 3=
-3.5 hours for one not very fluent in the main saptashati text.
 
If you ca=
n read saptashati in one hour, a bare-bones Chandi homam can be done in 1 h=
our 15 min.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

 Dear Utpalji,
        You have taken initiation from Narsimhaji and you ha=
ve really gained the knowledge. Your answers are also convincing and you ar=
e also explaining elaborately. Can I ask one question? Why you are addressi=
ng Narsimhaji as Garu instead of Guruji? 
        How much time is consumed=
 to perform daily Chandi Homam? In simple chanting of only 13 chapters I ta=
ke complete one hour.I am chanting mentally only. But if I do Homam, I thin=
k mentally it is not possible. Isn't it? Homam is to be done by uttering lo=
udly only, I think. What do you say?

          Dear Dhiraj Bhai,

  =
        following are answers for most of your questions to the best of my =

          expereince of Chandi Homam. these are for 'One time' Chandi Homa=
m 
          only.

          1) 1 kg Dry Coconut Halves are sufficient. Yo=
u can break each 
          coconut Half with your both the Palms and make =
3 to 4 pieces.

          2) A very small bowl of Ghee (roughly 6 to 8 full=
 teaspoons) is 
          sufficient as 'Ghee Aahutis' are to be given as o=
nly a single drop 
          whenever it is mentioned in the Manual.

     =
     3) When Ghee Aahutis are specifically not mentioned, one can offer 
  =
        Aaahutis of Mamara (Kurmura), Almond, Cahshewnuts, Kishmis, Daadiya=
 
          etc... Now one can choose each of the above stuffs one by one f=
or 
          offering as aahuti or can use single stuff.

          to ela=
borate, at each Swaha, one can take One Kishmis or Few Mamara 
          or=
 one almond or one cahsenut, or few Daadiya and offer to Agni.

          I=
f you have Havan Saamagri (I suppose it is mixuture of some stuff 
        =
  which can be offer in to Homa fire), then it can also be offered as 
    =
      Aahuti same as like other mentioned above. i.e. after swaha, take 
  =
        very little 'Havan samgri powder and offer it.

          Thus one =
person can easily perform homam as explained above because 
          first=
ly, one doesn't need to give Aahutis of Ghee and other stuff 
          sim=
ultaneously. secondly, Counting of any mantra can be done with 
          l=
eft fingers while offering aahutis by right hand.

          2 kg of Havan =
Saamagri is more than enough. in fact even 100 gms 
          will be suffi=
cient if you use along with along with Kurmura etc..

          4) The Homa=
 Fire represents Bhootagni of the person doing Homam. 
          hence it i=
s suggested that Aahutis are only offered by You alone 
          while mot=
her and others can sit beside you and concentrate. they 
          will gai=
n lot of spiritual benefit just by attending.

          5) Wooden Ladle is=
 ideal but in the absence of that copper one can 
          also be used.

=
          6) I have not much idea about the way of priest who offer ghee 
 =
         aahuti in Homa Agni as well as in water bowl. i think i've also se=
en 
          that during Chandi Homam of Ashtami during Navaraatri. I supp=
ose it 
          also must be one of the right ways. however i have comple=
te faith in 
          what Narasimha has given in Manual and that also mus=
t be the other 
          right way of many ways. although you can choose b=
etween the above 
          two, i recommend to go as per the Manual if you=
 are going to do as 
          per the manual given by him.

          Last=
ly, i would suggest not to bother yourself with much 
          technicalit=
ies and burden of perfection. in the first few runs, 
          there are m=
any things during Havan which can go imperefct. do as per 
          manual=
 and enjoy you Homam with your mother & others and offcourse 
          wit=
h the mother of universe !!!

          I hope, i gave you the answers - Be=
autifully.

          Warm Regards,

          Utpal

          single stuff.<BR><BR>to elaborate, at each Swaha, one can t=
ake One 
          Kishmis or Few Mamara <BR>or one almond or one cahsenut,=
 or few 
          Daadiya and offer to Agni.<BR><BR>If you have Havan Saam=
agri (I 
          suppose it is mixuture of some stuff <BR>which can be of=
fer in to Homa 
          fire), then it can also be offered as <BR>Aahuti =
same as like other 
          mentioned above. i.e. after swaha, take <BR>v=
ery little 'Havan samgri 
          powder and offer it.<BR><BR>Thus one pe=
rson can easily perform homam 
          as explained above because <BR>fir=
stly, one doesn't need to give 
          Aahutis of Ghee and other stuff <=
BR>simultaneously. secondly, Counting 
          of any mantra can be done =
with <BR>left fingers while offering aahutis 
          by right hand.<BR><=
BR>2 kg of Havan Saamagri is more than enough. in 
          fact even 100 =
gms <BR>will be sufficient if you use along with along 
          with Kurm=
ura etc..<BR><BR>4) The Homa Fire represents Bhootagni of the 
          pe=
rson doing Homam. <BR>hence it is suggested that Aahutis are only 
        =
  offered by You alone <BR>while mother and others can sit beside you 
    =
      and concentrate. they <BR>will gain lot of spiritual benefit just by =

          attending.<BR><BR>5) Wooden Ladle is ideal but in the absence of=
 that 
          copper one can <BR>also be used.<BR><BR>6) I have not much=
 idea about 
          the way of priest who offer ghee <BR>aahuti in Homa =
Agni as well as in 
          water bowl. i think i've also seen <BR>that d=
uring Chandi Homam of 
          Ashtami during Navaraatri. I suppose it <B=
R>also must be one of the 
          right ways. however i have complete fa=
ith in <BR>what Narasimha has 
          given in Manual and that also must=
 be the other <BR>right way of many 
          ways. although you can choos=
e between the above <BR>two, i recommend 
          to go as per the Manual=
 if you are going to do as <BR>per the manual 
          given by him.<BR><=
BR>Lastly, i would suggest not to bother yourself 
          with much <BR>=
technicalities and burden of perfection. in the first 
          few runs, =
<BR>there are many things during Havan which can go 
          imperefct. d=
o as per <BR>manual and enjoy you Homam with your mother 
          & o=
thers and offcourse <BR>with the mother of universe 
          !!!<BR><BR>I=
 hope, i gave you the answers - Beautifully.<BR><BR>Warm
