Namaste,

Good point. Yes, this Thursday coincides with Pushya nakshatra and that is 
auspicious. Thursday is owned by Brihaspati/Guru (Jupiter). Among 28 
nakshatras, Pushya is owned by Jupiter. Not only that, tomorrow is Panchami 
tithi, also owned by Jupiter. Thus, tithi, vaara and nakshatra are owned by 
Jupiter tomorrow. It is a day with very strong Jupiterian influence.

In India, entire Thursday after 9 am has this combination. In US, this 
combination exists until 4:20 pm on Thursday.

One can pray to Jupiter. Or engage in vedic rituals such as chanting 
chanting veda mantras, doing any kind of homam etc. Jupiter is the foremost 
of Brahmins and stands for Brahminical activity.

I am cc'ing this to vedic-wisdom yahoogroup after removing your name.

Best regards,
Narasimha
