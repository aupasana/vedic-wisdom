Dear All and also Joseph,
=C2=A0
After reading the mail...if you have under=
stood that there is no need for any ceremonies then what does this below ma=
il mean in the 1st place? Are you just doing a naamkarana ceremony (which i=
s just a social custom)???
=C2=A0
I ask you all this because I am utterly c=
onfused now. On one hand there is nothing like conversion and on the other =
hand someone is insisting on conversion!!
=C2=A0
Pray ....I need to know th=
is fast.
=C2=A0
Best....

Namaste,

Well, our shastras do not define a religion called "Hinduism". Our shastra=
s define sanatana dharma - the perennial path of righteous duty. Sanatana d=
harma is not an exclusive property of people born to "Hindu" parents. Sanat=
ana dharma belongs to the entire world and encompasses every human being wh=
ether or not one realizes it!

Some people who consider themselves Hindus m=
ay or may not be following dharma well.

There may not be much difference b=
etween somebody from another religion with a strong interest in "Hinduism" =
and somebody born to Hindu parents but having either passive interest or di=
sinterest in Sanatana dharma and teachings of rishis. In fact, the former m=
ay be a better adherent of Sanatana dharma than the latter in some cases! I=
f there is no need to convert the latter to "Hinduism", there is no need to=
 convert the former either!

Several ceremonies like naamakarana samskaara =
(naming) are more social customs than dharmik matters.

In my opinion, if a=
 person is given a Vedic or Pouraanik mantra (any) by a decent guru and ask=
ed to chant it everyday for an amount of time, and if he/she is exposed to =
some scripture (e.g. Gita, Upanishads etc) and asked to read it, understand=
 it and let it affect one's thinking, I think one is then a Hindu, i.e. one=
 will soon find oneself adhering to Sanatana dharma. There is no need for a=
ny ceremonies.

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

In fact, now there are some "foreigners" =
who perform a homam every weekend, to Ganapathi, Krishna etc. If anybody th=
inks they are not "Hindus", one is not thinking straight. They are more Hin=
dus than many Hindus in India who have forgotten their dharma.

A braahmana=
's dharma is to pursue spiritual progress and engage the mind in the god fo=
r the benefit of the world. One who does not spend time in japam or homam f=
or the benefit of the world is not a braahmana. If a foreigner is passionat=
ely interested in spiritual progress and does japam or homam every day or w=
eek for the benefit of the world and one's own spiritual upliftment, such a=
 foreigner is not only a Hindu, but also a braahmana.
