Dear Sharad,
=C2=A0
The main problem which peopl=
e have initially is that everybody wants something to happen while doing sa=
dhana.
This is because faith is somewhat weak at that point.
The sadhaka sh=
ould approach the smashana=C2=A0when he or she is drawn there by love for t=
he deities in that place. So the love of the deity overcomes all our inhibi=
tions and the person sits there with no thought for past or future, like a =
lover with his lover.

If you go to Mumbai, by the sea,=C2=A0many lovers si=
t there in the open, caressing each other with no thought as to who is watc=
hing, .......why?
=C2=A0
Because the love=C2=A0causes the inhibition of sha=
me.
That is what anybody who goes to the smashaan must have, otherwise unne=
ccessarily one thinks of all these things like hens and dogs and forgets al=
l about the real McCoy: the=C2=A0Deities of the smashaan who are also there=
 but who don't really want to be seen by you unless you are especially inte=
rested in them.

=C2=A0

The sadhana of fire must result in an experience o=
f the deity in your house, experience that first within your own body, then=
 bother about a smashaan.
Anyway the whole Universe is one big smashaan, al=
l the people here are dying, just born and going to die or ....dead.
Aghora=
 is the absence of Ghora, becoming an Aghori is a privelege in this world o=
f ours. Never be afraid to call yourself an Aghori if that is what you want=
.
Fear of people labelling you is of no consequence, you came with nothing =
and you will go with nothing.
What is Aghora and what is Vedanta anyway, th=
ey are the same for me. 
The whole Universe and it's layers exist before us=
, let us all try and perceive those layers using all the tools given to us.=

As Manish keeps saying, death is not a terminal thing. It is not a f=
ull stop or period, but just a comma. Let me tell a parable.


A person lov=
ed one dress and wore it always. He never removed the dress and kept the dr=
ess on him all the time and never considered the possibility of changing in=
to a different dress. The idea of removing that dress was unbearable to tha=
t person. He thought he should wear that dress forever.


The dress became =
so dirty and torn that it was time to change it. A person looking extremely=
 scary came up to the person oneday to remove the dress. He removed the dre=
ss gently if one co-operated with him and tore it apart violently if one fo=
ught back. After this scary person removed the old dress, another person ca=
me and gave new clothes. Some people became so afraid and ashamed when they=
 lost old clothes that they ran away and roamed around naked. If they did n=
ot become afraid or ashamed, they would've soon gotten new clothes and slow=
ly started to enjoy them as well.


The clothes in this parable are akin to=
 the physical body we occupy. The person looking extremely scary is Mahaaka=
ala - personification of Death. Creator is the person giving new clothes. N=
ew body taken in the next birth is the new clothes. Persons running away in=
 fear or shame before new clothese are given are like different kinds of sp=
irits.

Regarding your visualization of your father using =
reiki, please note that all visualizations of the mind are imagery created =
by one's conscious and sub-conscious conditionining. One's beliefs, desires=
, pride, frustrations etc shape the imagery one's mind visualizes. One cann=
ot assume it to be accurate. Also, there is no reliable way to know if your=
 prayers made any difference to the path taken by your father after the cre=
mation. The curiosity and the tendency to speculate will naturally last for=
 sometime, but the bottomline is that you cannot really do much more than s=
peculate.

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

Regarding the hen/cock, it is associated with K=
oumaari, among the forms of Divine Mother. In the 8th chapter of Chandipath=
, the Maatrikas (Mothers) are described (Braahmi, Maaheswari, Koumari, Vais=
hnavi etc). Koumari is accompanied by peacock and cock. In the Kaashi descr=
iptions given by Rajarshi, a sadhaka of Kaala Bhairava was worshipping in f=
uneral pyre at a sacred place with Kaala Bhairava as the guardian deity (Ka=
ashi). Dogs are associated with Kaala Bhairava. Perhaps the place you went =
to and you yourself have some blessing of Koumaari.

Dear Members,
After a lot of deliberation, I decided to write this note t=
o share an experience with the members on this forum - hoping that doing so=
 would elicit some feedback in the form of further guidance. 


I am a stud=
ent of Vipassana and have been doing homam (mostly Agnihotra and very recen=
tly started a simple version of Durga Homam) 'almost' regularly for a year =
now. And I have been reading the posts on this forum with much awe and inte=
rest. 


On the 28th of Jan, my father passed away peacefully (after strugg=
ling with renal failure and other complications) at our home in Hyderabad. =
When we were taking my father's body to the smashaan bhoomi for final rites=
, my mind was constantly reminded of the brilliant notes(Ram naam satya hai=
 - 1/2/3) written by Rajarshi (detailing his experience of doing a Chandi H=
omam on a funeral pyre in Kashi with Manish-ji), and I started wondering if=
 I would get to see some Aghoris in the smashaan bhumi at Hyd. I thought ho=
w wonderful it would be, if an Aghori performs a homam on my dad's funeral =
- so that he would also attain some punya (as per the note). And then immed=
iately, I had an intense desire to perform a similar homam by myself, but I=
 quickly reminded myself that I must be kidding to even think that I can do=
 such a feat. As we descended the steps of the smashaan bhumi, I started ex=
periencing intensely subtle sensations all over my body...especially
 in/ar=
ound the abdominal region. As taught in Vipassana, I 'watched' the sensatio=
ns as equanimously as I could, and told myself that 'even this would change=
'. Soon after, a thought came to my mind, that it is all at the level of th=
e mind, and may be I should perform a mini version of Chandi Homam in my me=
ntal imagery. But I still wanted to have a tangible element to it, so I ask=
ed a friend, if he could procure some black sesame seeds and jaggery (now w=
hen I think of it, this friend was not even baffled at my request) - and he=
 went away saying he would try and returned back in 10 minutes with the abo=
ve 2 things and in addition he bought some ghee. 


It was my first time at=
 a smashaan bhumi, and also the very first time that I had seen death/dead =
body at such close quarters. It was a very 'delicate' situation for me, but=
 soon after the fire was ignited (by my eldest brother - exactly at sunset =
time), I composed myself, went in the direction opposite to where all the f=
riends/relatives were standing and sat down on a stone platform in sukhaasa=
na. I asked my cousin and my nephew to sit on either side, told them that I=
 would like to meditate, and requested them to let me know if 'something' h=
appens. I had already observed a brown colored dog (thanks to the vivid des=
cription in Rajarshi's notes) as we reached the funeral-pyre platform, so I=
 think, I was expecting the dog to behave a little differently (silly me!!)=
:). 


I closed my eyes - thanked Mother Earth, my parents, my grandparents=
, the Gods and the Rishis; and seeked their support and blessings in my ver=
y first attempt in doing such a ritual. Being a Vipassana meditator, I am u=
sed to focussing on breath, and I saw my breathing was a little fast. I con=
tinued watching my breath for few minutes and soon, I was centred enough. I=
 remembered the warning that this should be done ONLY and ONLY with the pur=
est intention of gaining spiritual progress; so I inspected my mind and fou=
nd the truth to be different. I had a deep desire that my father accumulate=
s some 'punya' so that his journey in the non-physical plane is 'mangalmaye=
e' . I inspected further and felt that there was some thrill/excitement too=
 in my mind about attempting such a unconventional thing. I did not want to=
 give-up, so I mentally surrendered myself and said "this is the truth Maa,=
 I am not a true seeker, I have mundane desires. Everytime I have done
 hom=
am in the past, I have asked you to purify my mind, because I have believed=
 and still believe that it won't be good to ask for purification/ nullifica=
tion of my past karmas, if I continue generating new ones at the same speed=
. Today as well, I ask you to purify my impure mind. The impure mind that I=
 have, has this mundane desire that his father attains some punya and his j=
ourney ahead is peaceful. I am sincere, when I tell this to you Maa, so ple=
ase accept my impurities and my ignorance and let me do this homam. Please =
pardon this son of yours if he is doing something wrong". 


After this men=
tal dialogue, I though of invoking Durga on the funeral pyre (even though I=
 thought about Maa Kali/Smashan Kali etc etc) purely because the ONLY Devi =
mantra that I am a little comfortable with is a Durga Mantra. In my mind, I=
 said, ALL are forms of one and the same DeviShakti, and it should not real=
ly matter, which Devi form I invoke. But then I could not just visualise Ma=
a Durga and instead saw a cloud-like pattern, purple in colour, and fully o=
ccupying my mental imagery. I thought of my father - and was trying to co-r=
elate that with the colour of gangrene which had developed in his feet, but=
 the purple was different, and immediately a thought sprung in my mind asso=
ciating that colour with the colour of Maa Chandi who wears 'skeletal jewel=
lery' (NOT trying to be funny) and I said, aah..okay..so this is the form o=
f Maa which has arrived. I did mental Namaskar to Maa Chandi, repeated ment=
ally the thoughts about the desire and surrendering of
 my ignorance. I sou=
ght permission from the deity to use a Durga mantra by explaning the contex=
t. I also remember clearly, that I was a little scared too, and I told Maa =
to be kind, and to NOT give me any results if she didnt deem me to be fit, =
but to definetely NOT punish me in any way for doing this.


I had a small =
mental dialogue with my father, wherein I briefed him about what I was goin=
g to do, and I seeked his permission, forgiveness and blessings. 

And then=
 I started my mantra chanting (with swaha) - and tried visualising that I w=
as offering something in the pyre. I could not actually visualise any offer=
ings taking place - but I still continued with the swaha at the end of the =
mantra for a while, and then switched to a mantra-japam without the swaha a=
t the end. Through out I was fully aware of the visualisation of Maa Chandi=
 standing on my dad's funeral. Sometimes, I would visualise her lifting her=
 feet alternatively, as if she was crushing something. A few minutes later,=
 I felt the Devi removed a feet or a wooden log - and threw it at a little =
distance in the direction which was opposite to mine. I think about five/te=
n minutes later, I became a little curious and wanted to see if the dog had=
 come and was sitting somewhere around. I opened my eyes, and did NOT find =
the dog. I was not disappointed, but I told myself, it was silly of me to t=
hink I would be able to invite the deity, but nevertheless I
 continued. Fe=
w minutes later, I heard some sound of wings fluttering and opened my eyes =
to see a shining black hen (I think it was a rooster, as it had a small, bu=
t bright red hood/crown). It had come from the piece of land next to the sm=
ashaan bhumi (either a graveyard or a temple - am not sure) after descendin=
g from a 6ft boundary wall. It came close to the burning funeral and starte=
d jumping and moving around the funeral. It seemed as if the hen wanted to =
jump inside the funeral and die. Another second it felt, perhaps the hen wa=
s acting strange because it was amused with the fire particles (which looke=
d like 'jugnus') falling down on the earth, as a result of the funeral fire=
 hitting the cement roof of the funeral platform. I watched the bird for fe=
w minutes, laughed at myself, thinking a black hen came instead of a dog, b=
ut nevertheless I said I would continue until it is time for us to leave. I=
 asked my cousin and he said 30 more minutes. So I
 continued the mental ch=
anting. 


And then my cousin signalled me that it was time for everyone to=
 leave. I waited for everyone to start walking towards the exit, mixed the =
black sesame seeds, jaggery and ghee in the plastic packet itself, and walk=
ed towards the funeral. I seeked forgivess from Maa for my impudence and as=
ked her to accept my offerings. I had offered only three times, and it was =
sooooo hot that I could not stand closer and started wondering how far did =
Manish and Rajarshi sit to offer the samagri into the fire? Another cousin =
of mine, shouted my name from behind, and asked me to hurry up and join the=
m, and even though it was dark and he would not have seen exactly what was =
happening, I was a little scared because I did not want anyone to know that=
 I had 'Aghori' tendencies, I quickly stepped back, emptied the contents of=
 the packets in both my hands, apologised to the Devi again for my impudenc=
e and requested her to accept this final offering and threw it at the funer=
al
 pyre from a distance. I thanked her once again and requested her to sim=
ply do the needful and then thanked everyone (including the yahoo group and=
 Rajashri/Manish/ PVR) and quickly walked and joined the group. 


When I w=
as washing my hands and feet at the well, I looked at the funeral and now t=
here was a red tinge to the fire, which was not there before (could be beca=
use of black sesame seeds or jaggery??). 

On the way back home and for the=
 entire evening, I felt very very very quiet within. I would'nt say that I =
felt a sense of achievement, because the thought of what happened was not s=
trong in my mind. I had neither forgotten, nor was I thinking about 'it'. T=
here was a certian stillness within my existence that evening. I watched my=
 breath as much as I could. No judgement, no questions, just a sense of 'wo=
nder'. The visualisations could have been a product of my own imagination -=
 but the silence was real. And this experience of silence was the most beau=
tiful thing. 


The next day, I heard my brother tell my uncle that he had =
witnessed many fires, but the one yesterday seemed too big and somewhat spe=
cial. I wondered if my brother was speaking out of 'perception' or love for=
 our father.


Now that it is few days since that incident, I have question=
s like - is the hen too, as sensitive as a dog is? Why was it jumping 'madl=
y' around the fire? Is there a connection between the hen and the fact that=
 in Hyd, people perform hen-sacrifice at Shakti/Maa temples? Did Shakti rea=
lly grant some 'punya' to my dad? If it did, then why did I visualise my da=
d crawl and climb (as opposed to climbing on two feet) a half-constructed b=
uilding the next day when I was channeling some reiki to him? 


I am not s=
ure if these questions can be answered or if they should be answered at all=
, but based on the above experience, if anyone has any input/lessons/ guida=
nce/ teachings, I would be most appreciative.

Thank you PVR/Manish and Raj=
arshi for the continued inspiration. 


Also, apologies for the length of t=
he note.

Regards
Sharad

<p>Dear Members,<br>After =
a lot of deliberation, I decided to write this note to share an experience =
with the members on this forum - hoping that doing so would elicit some fee=
dback in the form of further guidance. <br><br>
I am a student of Vipassana=
 and have been doing homam (mostly Agnihotra and very recently started a si=
mple version of Durga Homam) 'almost' regularly for a year now. And I have =
been reading the posts on this forum with much awe and interest. <br>
<br>O=
n the 28th of Jan, my father passed away peacefully (after struggling with =
renal failure and other complications) at our home in Hyderabad. When we we=
re taking my father's body to the smashaan bhoomi for final rites, my mind =
was constantly reminded of the brilliant notes(Ram naam satya hai - 1/2/3) =
written by Rajarshi (detailing his experience of doing a Chandi Homam on a =
funeral pyre in Kashi with Manish-ji), and I started wondering if I would g=
et to see some Aghoris in the smashaan bhumi at Hyd. I thought how wonderfu=
l it would be, if an Aghori performs a homam on my dad's funeral - so that =
he would also attain some punya (as per the note). And then immediately, I =
had an intense desire to perform a similar homam by myself, but I quickly r=
eminded myself that I must be kidding to even think that I can do such a fe=
at. As we descended the steps of the smashaan bhumi, I started experiencing=
 intensely subtle sensations all over my body...especially
 in/around the a=
bdominal region. As taught in Vipassana, I 'watched' the sensations as equa=
nimously as I could, and told myself that 'even this would change'. Soon af=
ter, a thought came to my mind, that it is all at the level of the mind, an=
d may be I should perform a mini version of Chandi Homam in my mental image=
ry. But I still wanted to have a tangible element to it, so I asked a frien=
d, if he could procure some black sesame seeds and jaggery (now when I thin=
k of it, this friend was not even baffled at my request) - and he went away=
 saying he would try and returned back in 10 minutes with the above 2 thing=
s and in addition he bought some ghee. <br>
<br>It was my first time at a s=
mashaan bhumi, and also the very first time that I had seen death/dead body=
 at such close quarters. It was a very 'delicate' situation for me, but soo=
n after the fire was ignited (by my eldest brother - exactly at sunset time=
), I composed myself, went in the direction opposite to where all the frien=
ds/relatives were standing and sat down on a stone platform in sukhaasana. =
I asked my cousin and my nephew to sit on either side, told them that I wou=
ld like to meditate, and requested them to let me know if 'something' happe=
ns. I had already observed a brown colored dog (thanks to the vivid descrip=
tion in Rajarshi's notes) as we reached the funeral-pyre platform, so I thi=
nk, I was expecting the dog to behave a little differently (silly me!!):). =
<br>
<br>I closed my eyes - thanked Mother Earth, my parents, my grandparen=
ts, the Gods and the Rishis; and seeked their support and blessings in my v=
ery first attempt in doing such a ritual. Being a Vipassana meditator, I am=
 used to focussing on breath, and I saw my breathing was a little fast. I c=
ontinued watching my breath for few minutes and soon, I was centred enough.=
 I remembered the warning that this should be done ONLY and ONLY with the p=
urest intention of gaining spiritual progress; so I inspected my mind and f=
ound the truth to be different. I had a deep desire that my father accumula=
tes some 'punya' so that his journey in the non-physical plane is 'mangalma=
yee' . I inspected further and felt that there was some thrill/excitement t=
oo in my mind about attempting such a unconventional thing. I did not want =
to give-up, so I mentally surrendered myself and said "this is the truth Ma=
a, I am not a true seeker, I have mundane desires. Everytime I have done
 h=
omam in the past, I have asked you to purify my mind, because I have believ=
ed and still believe that it won't be good to ask for purification/ nullifi=
cation of my past karmas, if I continue generating new ones at the same spe=
ed. Today as well, I ask you to purify my impure mind. The impure mind that=
 I have, has this mundane desire that his father attains some punya and his=
 journey ahead is peaceful. I am sincere, when I tell this to you Maa, so p=
lease accept my impurities and my ignorance and let me do this homam. Pleas=
e pardon this son of yours if he is doing something wrong". <br>
<br>After =
this mental dialogue, I though of invoking Durga on the funeral pyre (even =
though I thought about Maa Kali/Smashan Kali etc etc) purely because the ON=
LY Devi mantra that I am a little comfortable with is a Durga Mantra. In my=
 mind, I said, ALL are forms of one and the same DeviShakti, and it should =
not really matter, which Devi form I invoke. But then I could not just visu=
alise Maa Durga and instead saw a cloud-like pattern, purple in colour, and=
 fully occupying my mental imagery. I thought of my father - and was trying=
 to co-relate that with the colour of gangrene which had developed in his f=
eet, but the purple was different, and immediately a thought sprung in my m=
ind associating that colour with the colour of Maa Chandi who wears 'skelet=
al jewellery' (NOT trying to be funny) and I said, aah..okay..so this is th=
e form of Maa which has arrived. I did mental Namaskar to Maa Chandi, repea=
ted mentally the thoughts about the desire and
 surrendering of my ignoranc=
e. I sought permission from the deity to use a Durga mantra by explaning th=
e context. I also remember clearly, that I was a little scared too, and I t=
old Maa to be kind, and to NOT give me any results if she didnt deem me to =
be fit, but to definetely NOT punish me in any way for doing this.<br>
<br>=
I had a small mental dialogue with my father, wherein I briefed him about w=
hat I was going to do, and I seeked his permission, forgiveness and blessin=
gs. <br><br>And then I started my mantra chanting (with swaha) - and tried =
visualising that I was offering something in the pyre. I could not actually=
 visualise any offerings taking place - but I still continued with the swah=
a at the end of the mantra for a while, and then switched to a mantra-japam=
 without the swaha at the end. Through out I was fully aware of the visuali=
sation of Maa Chandi standing on my dad's funeral. Sometimes, I would visua=
lise her lifting her feet alternatively, as if she was crushing something. =
A few minutes later, I felt the Devi removed a feet or a wooden log - and t=
hrew it at a little distance in the direction which was opposite to mine. I=
 think about five/ten minutes later, I became a little curious and wanted t=
o see if the dog had come and was sitting somewhere around. I
 opened my ey=
es, and did NOT find the dog. I was not disappointed, but I told myself, it=
 was silly of me to think I would be able to invite the deity, but neverthe=
less I continued. Few minutes later, I heard some sound of wings fluttering=
 and opened my eyes to see a shining black hen (I think it was a rooster, a=
s it had a small, but bright red hood/crown). It had come from the piece of=
 land next to the smashaan bhumi (either a graveyard or a temple - am not s=
ure) after descending from a 6ft boundary wall. It came close to the burnin=
g funeral and started jumping and moving around the funeral. It seemed as i=
f the hen wanted to jump inside the funeral and die. Another second it felt=
, perhaps the hen was acting strange because it was amused with the fire pa=
rticles (which looked like 'jugnus') falling down on the earth, as a result=
 of the funeral fire hitting the cement roof of the funeral platform. I wat=
ched the bird for few minutes, laughed at myself,
 thinking a black hen cam=
e instead of a dog, but nevertheless I said I would continue until it is ti=
me for us to leave. I asked my cousin and he said 30 more minutes. So I con=
tinued the mental chanting. <br>
<br>And then my cousin signalled me that i=
t was time for everyone to leave. I waited for everyone to start walking to=
wards the exit, mixed the black sesame seeds, jaggery and ghee in the plast=
ic packet itself, and walked towards the funeral. I seeked forgivess from M=
aa for my impudence and asked her to accept my offerings. I had offered onl=
y three times, and it was sooooo hot that I could not stand closer and star=
ted wondering how far did Manish and Rajarshi sit to offer the samagri into=
 the fire? Another cousin of mine, shouted my name from behind, and asked m=
e to hurry up and join them, and even though it was dark and he would not h=
ave seen exactly what was happening, I was a little scared because I did no=
t want anyone to know that I had 'Aghori' tendencies, I quickly stepped bac=
k, emptied the contents of the packets in both my hands, apologised to the =
Devi again for my impudence and requested her to accept this final offering=
 and threw it at the
 funeral pyre from a distance. I thanked her once agai=
n and requested her to simply do the needful and then thanked everyone (inc=
luding the yahoo group and Rajashri/Manish/ PVR) and quickly walked and joi=
ned the group. <br>
<br>When I was washing my hands and feet at the well, I=
 looked at the funeral and now there was a red tinge to the fire, which was=
 not there before (could be because of black sesame seeds or jaggery??). <b=
r><br>On the way back home and for the entire evening, I felt very very ver=
y quiet within. I would'nt say that I felt a sense of achievement, because =
the thought of what happened was not strong in my mind. I had neither forgo=
tten, nor was I thinking about 'it'. There was a certian stillness within m=
y existence that evening. I watched my breath as much as I could. No judgem=
ent, no questions, just a sense of 'wonder'. The visualisations could have =
been a product of my own imagination - but the silence was real. And this e=
xperience of silence was the most beautiful thing. <br>
<br>The next day, I=
 heard my brother tell my uncle that he had witnessed many fires, but the o=
ne yesterday seemed too big and somewhat special. I wondered if my brother =
was speaking out of 'perception' or love for our father.<br>
<br>Now that i=
t is few days since that incident, I have questions like - is the hen too, =
as sensitive as a dog is? Why was it jumping 'madly' around the fire? Is th=
ere a connection between the hen and the fact that in Hyd, people perform h=
en-sacrifice at Shakti/Maa temples? Did Shakti really grant some 'punya' to=
 my dad? If it did, then why did I visualise my dad crawl and climb (as opp=
osed to climbing on two feet) a half-constructed building the next day when=
 I was channeling some reiki to him? <br>
<br>I am not sure if these questi=
ons can be answered or if they should be answered at all, but based on the =
above experience, if anyone has any input/lessons/ guidance/ teachings, I w=
ould be most appreciative.<br><br>Thank you PVR/Manish and Rajarshi for the=
 continued inspiration. <br>
<br>Also, apologies for the length of the note=
.<br><br>Regards<br>Sharad<br><br></p></div>
