Namaste friends,

I will use the vedic-wisdom yahoogroup to reply to a couple of questions 
asked on twitter.

> @thinkerspad Piyush Kulshreshtha
> @homam108 :-)) I am happy conversing with you. Possibly the only 
> person I have met in Twitter who has well understood Dharm. Glad we 
> met.
> @homam108 I am also happy that your focus is on pariyatti and

> Must Follow @homam108. He can discuss Dharm with clarity. Above all, 
> he knows the importance of experience over reading.
> @homam108 What kind of experience is important?
> @homam108 How important are questions on existence of Atman or absence 
> of it, when they are still seekers?
> @homam108 Do Ved focus on existence of Atman more than its focus on 
> Samyak Karma and attaining wisdom through experience?

Though ocean is one, the ripples on the surface are many. At different 
depths/loocations, ocean has different qualities. Similarly, though 
Aatman (ocean) is one, the manifestations (ripples) in the material 
realm (surface) are many. At different realms of awareness 
(depths/locations), Aatman manifests differently in the field of 
duality.

One can have an infinite variety of experiences within the field of 
duality. One can "see" deities with various forms internally; one can 
"see" various kinds of light, one can "hear" various kinds of sounds, 
etc. One can lose awareness of the body completely, perceive the entire 
cosmos within the body and identify with some object within the cosmos 
and experience things from that perspective.

But, the bottomline is that all experiences within the field of duality 
are impermanent. The only "experience" that is really worthwhile is that 
of Self, where there are no boundaries within consciousness between the 
experiencer, the object of experience and the action of experiencing.

However, some people DO experience various things on the way, just as 
one driving to the mountain top may see beautiful sceneries on the ghat 
road (curvy mountain road). Just as one does not reach the mountain top 
if one likes some scenery so much that one stays there, similarly one 
developing an attachment to an experience will get stuck there and does 
not go on to experience Self. The peace and bliss one derives from any 
of these dualistic experiences is nice, but impermanent. The only source 
of everlasting and limitless peace and bliss is constant and equanimous 
awareness of Self, i.e. viewing everything as Self and not getting 
attracted to or being averse to anything.

The highest experience is that of a state where nothing disturbs the 
equanimity, where all beings and objects are seen by mind as Self though 
senses perceive them differently, where one's heart feels no attraction 
and aversion to anybody or anything, no like or dislike, no pleasure or 
pain in awareness of any dual reality, where one is able to engage in 
any action determined as necessary by one's intelligence, based on the 
desires that spontaneously arise in heart, where one is not affected 
positively and negatively by the results of any actions, just notices 
the result and moves on to the next action, where one is able to engage 
in powerful actions as though one is deeply desirous of a specific 
result, and yet is equally prepared for any result in the end, where 
one's heart is not touched by six internal enemies such as lust, anger, 
jealosy etc and the eight bondages such as fear, shame etc.

On the way to experiencing this state, one may experience many things 
and experience different levels of peace, calmness and happiness. But, 
one should not stop until one reaches this state. The only measure of 
how much progress one made is how equanimous one's mind is. Others may 
or may not be able to see it, but one knows for oneself how equanimous 
one's mind is.

In the beginning, having a simple belief system and following some 
procedures with discipline is helpful. Compared to the one who keeps 
chanting, "it does not matter from where you climb the mountain, but the 
key is reach the mountain top" and remains at the base of the mountain 
forever, one who keeps arguing "your way does not reach the top. It 
stops in the middle. Come and climb in my path. This is the only path 
that reaches the top" and keeps walking on a path, is better! The first 
one knows truth, but is not acting on it. The second one has 
misconceptions, but he is atleast climbing the mountain. As he reaches 
the top, he will actually see that all paths from all sides of the 
mountain are indeed reaching the top and his misconceptions will be 
destroyed automatically!

One who is still doing sadhana and hasn't experienced Self can make 
wrong, biased, narrow-minded and zingoistic statements. But, it's ok, as 
long as one is not killing people or causing terrible confusion in 
masses. One is atleast making progress and eventually one will 
understand the meaning of RigVedic saying "ekam sat, vipraa bahudhaa 
vadanti" (Truth is one, but expressed variously by the learned).

That way, compared to a theoretician discussing Vedanta and high 
philosophy, one doing a ritual everyday without fail is better off. Of 
course, if one has an understanding of theoretical philosophy, engages 
in some sadhana with discipline, and keeps absorbing the philosophy into 
one's thinking, so that it will oneday guide all of one's actions, 
words, thoughts and impulses, one will progress faster.

When watching a movie, one can exclaim "this is just a movie and not 
real. There is no need to take it seriously". Yet, when a truly scary 
scene comes, one may be startled! One watching the movie again and again 
while contemplating the above theoretical knowledge will eventually 
reprogram one's instincts and scary scenes will no longer startle one, 
sad scenes will no longer make one cry, or happy scenes will no longer 
make one jump up in joy. Understtanding (gyaan) and practice (karma) are 
both required to permanently ingrain correct understanding on one's 
consciousness and make one stop reacting in a deluded manner to the 
field of duality.

On various paths (such as Vedic vs Tantrik), a nice analogy was given on 
pages 130-131 of the free PDF eBook at:

In the same eBook, page 104 contains a nice analogy that explains 
adwaita, visishta adwaita and dwaita.

Best regards,
Narasimha
