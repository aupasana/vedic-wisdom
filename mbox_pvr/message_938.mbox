Namaste,
 
Vishnu is the maintainer of dharma and sustainer of the worlds. =
He maintains natural order in creation. One may start chanting his names wi=
thout understanding the meanings. After chanting those names for a few mont=
hs or years, one will wonder about the meanings and learn the meanings of t=
hose 1000 names. Then, as one chants, one's mind forms auspicious images ba=
sed on those names. Frequent occurrence of those images and thoughts in the=
 mind purifies the mind and strengthens certain tendencies of the mind and =
weakens others.
 
Vishnu sahasra naam is a very saattwik prayer that promot=
es dharma and sattwa in the person.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

          Namaste Ashwin ji,

          > ... regarding Shri Vi=
shnu Sahasra Naam. Is it really
          > worth reciting daily?

        =
  Honestly speaking, I am embarrassed that somebody thinks a fool like me c=
an certify or endorse or comment on the "worth" of Vishnu sahasra naam, whi=
ch was taught by Bhishma to Dharmaraja at the onset of Kali yuga to help hu=
man beings in Kali yuga in following their dharma.

          *        *   =
     *

          Mantras like Vishnu sahasra naam (1000 names of Lord Vish=
nu), Hanuman chalisa, Chandipath, Mahamantra (Hare Krishna), Gayatri mantra=
, Rudram, Arunam, Pavamana sooktam, Mrityunjaya mantra, panchakshari, ashta=
kshari, dwadasakshari etc are well-established and many people achieved spi=
ritual progress with them. One cannot question their worth.

          *   =
     *        *

          However, that is not to say that everyone medita=
ting with them will make fast spiritual progress. To explain this, let me r=
eturn to a previous analogy, as I believe that analogies help one understan=
d concepts better.

          Mantras are for protecting mind (from its ene=
mies, i.e. one's weaknesses like ego, pride, attachment, lust, anger etc). =
Imagine one's mind to be a person. Imagine one's weaknesses to be enemies c=
harging at the person aggressively. Imagine mantra to be a weapon (stick or=
 stone or gun) in the hands of the person.

          One may have a nice s=
tick that was used by thousand people before him to beat up strong enemies.=
 Yet, he may not know how to use it and the weapon may become ineffective i=
n his hands. If one taps an aggressive enemy gently with a stick, that will=
 hardly be effective. One has to beat hard and with all the energy one can =
muster. Similarly, one's will power should be strongly focused on overcomin=
g ego, pride, lust, anger, jealosy etc and one should make conscious and fo=
rceful effort.

          If one with some experience in beating up enemies=
 with sticks tries to throw stones at them, he may not know how to aim and =
may fail. Similarly, one with experience in chanting other mantras tries be=
ejaksharas, one may not succeed in aiming them correctly and making them wo=
rk.

          If one not knowing how to shoot a gun aims a gun confidently=
 as the enemy approaches and tries in vain to shoot, one will fail and be b=
eaten by enemy. Similarly, one not knowing how to use powerful Veda mantras=
 is overconfident, he may fail in sadhana and succumb to ego, pride etc. If=
 one atleast realizes that one cannot shoot, one can atleast use the gun as=
 a stick and try to beat up the enemy. Similarly, if one atleast realizes t=
hat one does not know how to put veda mantra to use, one can chant the veda=
 mantra hundreds or thousands of times everyday with sincerity, surrender a=
nd humility and try consciously to control negative emotions such as ego, p=
ride, lust, anger, jealosy etc.

          *        *        *

          B=
ottomline is this: Just as how well a person puts a weapon to use and overc=
omes enemies depends on how strong and serious the person is, how much trai=
ning and practice he has in using the weapon, similarly how well a person p=
uts a mantra to use use to overcome internal weaknesses depends on what kin=
d of mental conditioning one has, how strong a desire one has for spiritual=
 progress, what kind of a guru one has and how much effort one puts into sp=
iritual sadhana. Thus, we cannot make a blanket statement that reading Vish=
nu sahasra naam, for example, everyday will help one become pure and get mo=
ksha.

          While one engages in various external practices as a part =
of the spiritual sadhana, one should remember that the internal goal is to =
overcome ego and attain a spirit of complete surrender and detachment and t=
ry to cultivate that internal spirit. In the beginning, things are difficul=
t and this is a mere thought. But, as one progresses and crosses a threshho=
ld, external practices promote stronger internal focus and purity and stron=
ger internal focus and purity promote better and more effective sessions of=
 external practice. A kind of synergy develops between them. Eventually, on=
e makes sufficient progress internally, which is the goal after all.

     =
     Whatever mantra or stotra or ritual was given to you by a guru that yo=
u *surrendered* to, you should follow it while engaging in internal contemp=
lation on an ongoing basis.

          Best regards,
          Narasimha
