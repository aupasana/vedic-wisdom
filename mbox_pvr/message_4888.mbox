Namaste friends,
 
My 2 cents:
 
(1) Saptashati with or without Kunjika sto=
tra can give any material results, spiritual progress and even samadhi.
 
(=
2) While I agree that Kunjika stotra is over-played in some traditions, it =
is not fair to say that Kunjika stotra itself cannot give samadhi. In fact,=
 such a statement cannot be made about ANY mantra. To take things further, =
a sadhaka who is pure already may be able to go into samadhi just chanting =
a non-mantra like "Matsyendranath ki jay ho" or "Jesus is the savior".
 
(3=
) I maintain that Kunjika stotra is a highly codified compendium of specifi=
c sadhanas to get specific results from Chandipath. It was codified for a r=
eason and not everyone reading Kunjika stotra can get those results easily.=
 Moreover, these results can be gotten without Kunjika stotra also. So the =
bottomline is that there is no need to be over-attached to Kunjika stotra.
=
 
(4) In general, the belief some people have that there is some "secret ke=
y" they are missing and that is why they are not making material and spirit=
ual progress in their sadhana, is incorrect. If you are praying and nothing=
 is happening, it is most certainly not because you are missing a secret ke=
y. It may be because you need more devotion. It may be because the amount o=
f sadhana you are doing is not enough, as the karmas blocking you are reall=
y big and need sadhana that is commensurate with them.
 
(5) Hyperbole is a=
 famous (and common) figure of speech in Sanskrit writing. Instead of takin=
g things literally, one needs to understand the true meaning and intent.
 
=
(6) Bottomline: If you like Chandipath alone, do it. If you like Chandipath=
 with Kunjika stotra, do it. If you like Kunjika stotra alone, do it (but i=
t is a good idea to do Chandipath also). If you like something else, do it.=
 Instead of being dogmatic about what combination needs to be done, just do=
 something or the other and try to increase your devotion. Mantras, procedu=
res and rituals are tools to increase the control over mind and devotion. I=
f too much deliberation is blocking one from doing any mantra, procedure or=
 ritual, it is no good.
 
*        *        *
 
Someone else wrote about th=
e method of doing Chandipath. Kavacha, argala, keelaka, Raatri sooktam, nya=
sas, moola mantra, 13 chapters of Saptashati, moola mantra, Devi sooktam, r=
ahasyas and Siddha Kunjika stotra is the normal order. If one is unable to =
do all this and wants to do just the 13 chapters, it is perfectly fine IMHO=
. In fact, just doing one chapter (e.g. chapter 4 or 11) is also fine.
 
Be=
st regards,
Narasimha
