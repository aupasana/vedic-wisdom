Namaste,

Do you really think that these internet translations are accurate? Of course 
not. These are unintelligent and dumb translations at best and ill-motivated 
translations with a hideous agenda at worst. In either case, do bot rely on 
them.

Let me reproduce the rik.

Rishi: Angirasa Virupa, Chhandas: Gayatri, Devata: Agni

ukShaannaaya vashaannaaya somapR^iShThaaya vedhase | stomairvidhemaagnaye | 
RV 8-43-11 |

The translation given by Swami Satya Prakash Saraswati in the version 
published by Veda Pratishthana, New Delhi is: "Let us adore with hymns the 
fire-divine, who is fed on agricultural products, dairy products, and who 
bears the herbal plants on the back."

This is far more intelligent than what you quoted. However, I am still not 
satisfied. Let me give my take on it. I just meditated on it for a few 
minutes and this is what I make of it.

*        *        *

(uksha = supreme, large
anna = matter)
ukshaannaaya = to one who feeds the channel of domination, i.e. pingala nadi
(vasha = submissive, controlled, obedient
anna = matter)
vashaannaaya = to one who feeds the channel of submission, i.e. ida nadi
somapR^iShThaaya = to one who carries the nectar of immortality in the 
middle channel, i.e. sushumna nadi
vedhase = to the one who is virtuous and great
stomaih = by hymns
vidhema = may we worship/praise/honor/contemplate
agnaye = to fire.

MEANING: "May we contemplate on the fire god, who feeds the pingala nadi of 
dominance and ida nadi of submission and virtuously carries the nectar of 
immortality in the sushumna nadi."

PURPORT: "Fire is the transformative power. It is the basis of our 
existence. It is what fuels (feeds) every part of our being. The fire that 
burns in the sookshma sareera (subtle body) is called bhoota agni. This fire 
feeds the pingala nadi (solar channel of the subtle body) and causes 
analytical and logical abilities and aggressive instincts of domination and 
control. The same bhoota agni also feeds the ida nadi (lunar channel of the 
subtle body) and causes submission and calmness. In modern medical parlance, 
we can say the same fire feeds and runs the sympathetic and parasympathetic 
nervous systems and provokes the "push" and "pull" actions of the push-pull 
nervous system. In addition, the same bhoota agni also drives the sushumna 
nadi and makes the nectar of immortality (sat-chid-ananda) flow in that 
channel. We should contemplate the various roles played by this subtle fire 
in our subtle body in amazement."

If I spend more time, I may be able to do better justice. But this is what I 
understand of this rik as of now.

*        *        *

Veda is about self-knowledge and nothing less. Most people cannot understand 
even a single verse of Veda fully in an entire life. Ignore the people who 
claim to be scholars in Veda and make claims on what Veda says and what Veda 
does not say. Secondly, time has come to dump all the abusive and motivated 
translations of Veda.

The only translation/commentary on Veda that pleased me until now is the one 
by Sri Aurobindo. He is undoubtedly a reborn rishi. Such depth and clarity 
of thinking is impossible otherwise.

Best regards,
Narasimha
