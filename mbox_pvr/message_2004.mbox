Namaste,
 
For beejaaksharas, both versions ending with the nasal in ka-gro=
up (ng) and the nasal in pa-group (m) are valid. They work differently, but=
 both are valid.
 
However, the problem with the former is that most people=
 cannot pronounce it correctly. The correct pronunciation is to start sayin=
g "hreeng" and stop just when you are about to say "g". The sound "g" shoul=
d not be explicit at all. To pronounce that nasal "n(g)" correctly, you hav=
e to think that you are going to say "ng", but stop just short of "g". It i=
s not easy. Most people end up pronouncing the "g" sound a bit. Instead of =
making that mistake, it is better to just stick to "hreem".
 
Bottomline: T=
he forms hreem and hreen(g) with a silent g are both fine. But hreeng with =
an explicit g is a bad idea.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

  Dear Narsimha,
   
  Hope you are doing great.
   
  I have a smal=
l question. 
   
  Someone said that "Hreeing" is more appropriate than "Hr=
eem". Would you agree..?
   
  Thanks
