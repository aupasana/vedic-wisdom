Namaste Hari,
 
1. The order used traditionally is tarpana first, then sandhya vandana, then homa. Tarpana was integrated with bath. You take bath in a river and do tarpana right there (and leave the water right there in the river). Then you come out, do sandhyavandana and other rituals.
 
My recommendation based on the lifestyles now and the needs and capabilities of people now is contained in:
 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/2357
 
2. Yes! Pitripaksha that started yesterday/today is a fantastic time to do tarpana. Doing it everyday or atleast on as many days as possible, during this fortnight, is a great idea.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
