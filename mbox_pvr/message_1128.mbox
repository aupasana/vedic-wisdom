Namaste,

Graha means one that grasps. Grahas are personification of qualities that 
grasp one's consciousness and thinking based on previous conditioning.

Mars is personification of the spirit of initiative, enthusiasm and energy. 
Of course, he can grant one's desires.

Planets are self-realized and liberated from the cycle of life and death, 
i.e. they are jeevanmuktas. From that point of view, rishis, gods like 
Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva and planets are similar. They are liberated and 
continue to discharge their duties till the pre-ordained time period without 
being deluded by duality, and merge in Brahman at the end of that time 
period. During that period, they may exist in multiple forms, be reborn and 
what not.

They are doing their duty/dharma without any attachment whatsoever.

Planets are also deities and they have a specific job of grasping people's 
consciousness and give them different thoughts and experiences, based on 
their previous karmas.

Best regards,
Narasimha
