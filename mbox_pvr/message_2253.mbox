Namaste,

Yes, ye vs yai is just grammar.

Unfortunately, many books and websites have gross typos. Some basic 
knowledge of Sanskrit is useful to filter things.

The book "Mantra Mahodadhi" is a good source for various mantras.

BTW, tonight is Krishna Janmashtami, birth night of Lord Krishna. This is a 
great time to pray to Krishna. Some mantras to Krishna can be found in the 
"Sri Krishna Homam" manual at the homam website.

Best regards,
Narasimha
