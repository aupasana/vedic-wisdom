Namaste Sir,

What is purity anyway? How can we purify the five elements?
 
If there=
 is attachment to something which we think of as our possession, can the ea=
rth element inside us be considered to be pure? If there is attachment to s=
omething which we want to control, can the fire element inside us be consid=
ered to be pure? And so on.
 
If we are vulnerable to the six internal enem=
ies - lust, anger, greed, delusion, wantonness and jealosy - then aren't th=
ere still impurities?
 
Complete surrender and humility that I mentioned ar=
e not some hollow virtues. They are the real signs of purity.
 
*        * =
       *
 
Whatever mantra you are given by your guru, whatever mantra you =
picked out of attraction, or whatever mantra you otherwise do, please do no=
t think too much whether it is the right mantra. That is secondary. IF ther=
e is a mantra you use, use it sincerely and with devotion. Use it as a tool=
 to increase your surrender and devotion. At that end, THAT is what matters=
 and brings results.
 
A person with a broken leg needs to use a walking st=
ick until the leg cures and becomes fit. How big or heavy the stick is, wha=
t wood it is made of, what is the carving on it, etc, is not that important=
. The main purpose of the stick to give complete rest to the leg and help i=
t cure fast. If one worries too much about the beauty and technical details=
 of the stick and ends up putting stress on the leg, the stick does not ser=
ve its purpose. The stick is helpful only if you consciously spare the leg =
from effort. Once the leg cures, you can then not only walk but also run. S=
imilarly, a lot of technical details of the mantra do not matter much. Use =
mantra to focus the mind and cure it of its conditioning (i.e. impurity!).

Narasimha
