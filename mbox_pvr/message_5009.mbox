Words come with baggage and may mean different things to differ=
ent people depending on their life experiences and outlook in life. It is v=
ery tough to convey sophisticated philosophy using words.
 
All pervading s=
hakti works through all of us and expresses through all of our desires, act=
ions and knowledge. But then, some universal rules of action and reaction g=
overn how this works. Under the push of one's own previous karmas, one is p=
laced in situations that are conducive to certain desires, actions and awar=
eness. The current karmas in those situations may further modify the moment=
um of the push (reaction) from previous actions. Though one's current desir=
es, actions and awareness are actually the work of the all pervading shakti=
, they are also one's work in a way. It depends on how we look at it and ho=
w we abstract it. Though Ganges water in a bucket, Ganges water in a small =
cup, Ganges water in a cup in hot weather and Ganges water in a cup in free=
zing weather are all Ganges water, they are different too. One is more, one=
 is less, one is warm and one is icy. Similarly, the work of all pervading =
shakti is different when expressed through different vessels (people) in di=
fferent situations.
 
As long as one actually feels internally (despite wha=
t one may say or pretend externally) that one's desires, actions and knowle=
dge are one's own, one is performing karmas and is bound to receive their k=
aarmik reactions. Only when the realization that it is all the work of the =
all pervading shakti becomes full and completely internalized, does one bec=
ome free from the cycle of actions and reactions.
 
*        *        *
 
T=
hus, any tests one may encounter are reactions to one's own actions in orde=
r to facilitate one's journey towards realizing Self. It is not that the Mo=
ther does not like one or wants to see how one does. The tester, the tested=
 and the test are all different expressions of the Mother only. But, for on=
e who does not realize it fully, they are tests thrown at one.
 
*        *=
        *
 
If one desired a particular pleasure in a previous life, one ma=
y be placed in a situation where that pleasure can be had now. That can be =
called a test or simply a reaction to one's desire. Irrespective of what we=
 call it, one cannot become free without correct handling of that situation=
.
 
If one abused a specific branch of knowledge in a previous life and gav=
e some bad name to it, one may be placed in a situation where one can do ju=
stice to that branch of knowledge and give it some good name now. That can =
be called a test or a reaction to one's action. Irrespective of what we cal=
l it, one cannot become free without correct handling of that situation. An=
d so on.
 
*        *        *
 
One needs to experience the reactions to a=
ll of one's actions - good and bad - eventually. Whether one realizes it or=
 not, liberation is the final goal of all and all people are marching towar=
ds it only. Thus, testing (having to face reactions to one's own tricky act=
ions in the past) automatically happens as one marches in the evolution tow=
ards liberation, sadhana or no sadhana. With spiritual sadhana, some karmas=
 are fully or mosly dropped from the pipeline and the dynamics and timing o=
f which karma gives results when may change.
 
*        *        *
 
It is =
unproductive to think in terms of "I am being tested", "I need to pass this=
 test", "will I fail this test" etc? The tests one has to face in one's spi=
ritual evolution are not like tests we face in our studies. It is not like =
you fail and that's the end of it or it becomes a blot on your record. You =
keep getting a chances again and again, until you finally pass. You have to=
 experience various experiences until none of them block you from Self.
