Namaste,
 
Nice mail!
 
Ramakrishna is absolutely unique. Though many other=
 masters came to earth in the last few centuries, who perfected some types =
of spiritual moods or the other, he is someone who perfected everything. He=
 would chant Hari's name, melt with emotion and go into bhaava samaadhi for=
 hours together. He would engage in 64 kriyas of tantra, without his mind b=
eing perturbed by anything. He would be in samadhi where he is at the feet =
of god. He would be in samadhi where he is in oneness with god. He would be=
 in nirvikalpa samadhi where there are no gods, no demons, no beings or obj=
ects, but just Aatman or Brahman.
 
The same person who would behave like a=
 small child at times would also show unmatched wisdom all the time. He wou=
ld transform an illiterate servant boy (Latu) into a great spiritual master=
 (Swami Adbhutananda) who was established in Shiva-consciousness at all tim=
es. He would transform an energetic, skeptical, irreverant, independent, ra=
tional and highly intelligent young man with several biases (Naren) into a =
venerable and compassionate saint known as a great teacher around the world=
 (Swami Vivekananda).
 
He practiced karma yoga and his sishyas and the mut=
t established by them engaged in so much social service across India. He pr=
acticed jnaana yoga and his sishyas popularized Adwaita across the world. H=
e even engaged in raja yoga and taught a select few like Vivekananda. He of=
 course practiced bhakti yoga and melted in devotion when thinking of Kaali=
 in the same way as he did when thought of Krishna. He even did Christian a=
nd Islamic sadhanas.
 
He not only experienced the Absolute himself, but wa=
s capable of making others experience. His mere touch took Vivekananda into=
 samadhi in their second meeting. Vivekananda experienced other higher stat=
es later due to Ramakrishna's will (e.g. what happened for a few days after=
 he mocked the Vedantic statement that all is god, in front of Ramakrishna)=
. Even his guru Totapuri who was an adept in Adwaita and experienced nirvik=
alpa samadhi several times was, for the first time in his life, introduced =
to the power of the Mother by Ramakrishna. Totapuri considered faith in sag=
una forms of god as childish and believed only in the formless Brahman. But=
 he left Dakshineshwar with a healthy respect for the Saguna forms. He actu=
ally went inside the temple and prostrated before the idol before he left D=
akshineshwar! And, there is the kalpataru day, when people started experien=
cing different levels of spiritual bliss just by touching him. Everyone who=
 touched him that day went into a spiritual ecstasy and stayed in it frozen=
 right there in the garden. Some even went into different levels of samadhi=
.
 
If this is how the Leela of an incarnation is, imagine how the leela of=
 a poorna purusha like Lord Krishna must have been!
 
I personally love ana=
logies, allegories, metaphors and parables. Ramakrishna was an absolute mas=
ter of those. He demystified things and taught the highest Truths in simple=
 terms so that everybody can understand the essence.
 
Ramakrishna is an ab=
solutely unique saint who showed that all paths lead to god, not by stating=
 theory, but by demonstrating it practically.
 
Unlike saints like Buddha, =
Aadi Shankara, Moses and Jesus, he is relatively recent and his life is wel=
l-documented.
 
*        *        *
 
The field of duality is like a dream.=
 Being established in Brahman or Aatman is like the wakeful state. All the =
objects of dream disappear when one is awake. They are unreal. However, the=
y are quite real for one who is still in the dream! And, a roaring lion fro=
m a dream and a meowing cat from a dream are so different in their nature, =
abilities and effect. Even though a jnaani may tell you there is god (Brahm=
an) in everything and all are equal, it is true only for one established in=
 Brahman. If one is awake, a roaring lion from a dream and a meowing cat fr=
om a dream are equal. But, to somebody still sleeping, both are so differen=
t.
 
Though all beings are but god, different beings play different roles i=
n the field of Maayaa and there is a clear hierarchy.
 
Best regards,
Naras=
imha
