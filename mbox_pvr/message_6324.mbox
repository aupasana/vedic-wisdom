Subject: Generic Fire Ritual Manual for the Ungrounded in Hinduism

Namaste,

Now there is fire ritual manual for those who are not that ground=
ed in 
Hinduism and Hindu philosophy, but are open to trying the fire ritua=
l. 
It is a simplified procedure. It includes offerings to Vedic deities 
s=
uch as Prajapati, Indra, Soma etc, but explains it in a way that 
open-mind=
ed non-Hindus can rationalize and relate internally. It allows 
non-Hindus =
to incorporate their faith and sacred chants of their faith 
into a fire ri=
tual procedure that is essentially taken from Hinduism. 
Please go to:

htt=
p://www.VedicAstrologer.org/fire

Please feel free to send suggestions and =
comments to me at 
pvr108@.... This is the first attempt and can evol=
ve over time. 
The goal is to enable as many people as possible to approach=
 the divine 
via the sacred medium of fire.

A few mon=
ths back, Manish sat next to an American lady in a flight. His 
intuition t=
old him to tell her a few things. He told her a few things 
that would happ=
en in the next few months. He told her she MUST do a fire 
ritual regularly=
 to overcome some serious problems in her life. He also 
gave her his email=
 address. She told me later that she thought he was 
"insane" to talk to a =
stranger like that. Later, when some specific 
things happened as told by M=
anish, some to the day, she developed trust 
in Manish (Manish told me he w=
as just acting on his intuition withought 
knowing why). She emailed him an=
d later talked to him. Manish 
re-iterated to her that she MUST do fire rit=
ual to overcome current and 
future problems and he put her in touch with m=
e.

I gave her the Mahaganapati homam manual, but it was Greek and Latin to=
 
her. She is a practicing Christian and does not know much about 
Hinduism=
. She was totally lost in in the manual and could not put it to 
use, thoug=
h she really wanted to do a fire ritual. I spent an hour on 
phone with her=
 and explained a simple procedure that she could relate 
to, remember and d=
o. She did homam a few times and found it to have a 
soothing and calming i=
nfluence, though she was very nervous, afraid and 
tense when she started o=
ut. Another friend of her, also a practicing 
Christian with open-mindednes=
s to other practices, was also interested 
in trying fire ritual and asked =
for info. This made me think of writing 
a manual suitable for a group curr=
enly left out.

*        *        *

Coincidentally, Manish, I and a few ot=
her friends had a discussion a 
month back about non-Hindus performing fire=
 ritual. Though some sincere 
and learned friends had reservations, I opine=
d: "If one cannot relate to 
a Sanskrita mantra and can relate to a Latin o=
r Greek or Arabic chant, I 
see no problem in offering that to god. I do no=
t really think Agni will 
say "I do not know that god and cannot carry the =
offering to that god". 
I do not see gods as Hindu gods and non-Hindu gods =
and see all of them 
as personifications of various natures and qualities i=
nherent to us. I 
reckon that Agni is capable of translating. Thus, I am no=
t averse to 
enabling non-Hindus to do a fire ritual by essentially retaini=
ng the 
basic homam structure, but replacing the main mantra of pradhaana h=
omam 
section with a non-Sanskrit sacred chant."

I had copied Sri Robert S=
voboda (author of Aghora series on Vimalananda) 
on that discussion. He put=
 his view on record in a private email: "Just 
for the record, my view is v=
ery similar to yours =E2=80=93 the important thing 
is to create a relation=
ship with fire, and via the fire, with Brahman, 
Nirguna or Saguna =E2=80=
=93 Saguna being much easier. There are many devatas in 
the world, and I t=
oo do not really think Agni will say "I do not know 
that god and cannot ca=
rry the offering to that god". I too do not see 
gods as Hindu gods and non=
-Hindu gods; if Agni can be purohit for one, 
he can be purohit for any."

If you know of some people who are not well-versed in =
Hinduism but are 
open-minded to try new spiritual practices, please feel f=
ree to point 
them to this document.

Narasimha
