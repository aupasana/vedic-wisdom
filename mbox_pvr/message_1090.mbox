Namaste Sri Radhakrishnan,
 
While I respect the orthodoxy of Kerala temple=
s, it will not work in cold countries and even in north India during winter=
. Many priests do wear shirts when performing homas in winter here, in Bost=
on, USA.
 
Honestly, the clothes that we wrap around the body to hide the t=
rue body are not a major issue and have very little bearing on our sadhana.=
 The layers of conditioning by various gunas that we wrap around our ego-co=
nsciousness to hide the true Self IS the major issue that blocks our spirit=
ual progress. The former is a symbol and the latter is the real thing that =
matters. Shedding those layers surrounding the ego is far more important th=
an removing shirt.
 
Actually, though I live in cold climate, the room in w=
hich I recorded the video was comfortable enough and I could have done with=
out the shirt. But I consciously chose to record it with a shirt on, in ord=
er to not send a wrong message to those living in cold climates and having =
to do homam in cold garages. Instead of sticking to unnecessarily strict ru=
les and ending up not doing homam as often, I want people to relax rules th=
at do not matter and do it as often as they can. I want to de-emphasize thi=
ngs that do not matter that much.
 
World is going to go through interestin=
g times and we need many serious sadhakas - those who may be wearing many c=
lothes on the body but shed off as many layers as possible on their ego - d=
oing homam on a regular basis.
 
I use more materials in my daily Chandi ho=
mam (because I use a bigger homa kundam for it) than I used in the video, b=
ut again that was a conscious choice. I did not want something elaborate. I=
 wanted to demonstrate how a very simple homam can be performed quite easil=
y with very few materials and a simple setup. Even a very simple procedure =
like this will make a big difference in the world, if a lot of people are d=
oing this sincerely everyday.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

        r u living in a foreign country. Normally homam=

Homam Video (based on the manual)

          Namaste friends,

          Th=
is weekend, Ravi shot video of a 20-minute Maha Ganapathi homam being 
    =
      performed by me, based on the procedure in the manual. He uploaded it=
 to 
          Google Video and YouTube today. What is in Google Video is o=
ne file that is 
          20 min 28 min long (and 92 MB in size). It is do=
wnloadable to your computer 
          and you can play it using free softw=
are QuickTime. On YouTube, it is stored 
          as three parts and has a=
 higher quality. You can play those three parts 
          directly from Yo=
uTube.

          If you go to the homam homepage (see below) and go to Mah=
a Ganapathi Homam 
          page, you will see all related links right the=
re.

          To limit the video size, we made everything bare minimum. Th=
e veda mantra 
          and beeja mantra are chanted 8 times each and Atha=
rva seersham once. You can 
          of course use higher counts and do it=
 longer.

          Thanks to Ravi for his effort!

          Best regards,=

          Narasimha
