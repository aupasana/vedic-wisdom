Namaste Sir,
 
[I am cc'ing to vedic-wisdom yahoogroup where I write my spi=
ritual mails these days.]
 
(1) For married women, we use the gotra of husb=
and. For unmarried women, we use father's gotra.
(2) Yes, you repeat with g=
otra and name changed.
 
Pitri tarpana and homam are two very useful ritual=
s. In homam, you are reaching out to beings that strongly identify with sou=
l (Sun, fire). In pitri tarpana, you are reaching out to beings that strong=
ly identify with mind (Moon, water). Though homam can be done to pitris (th=
ey have a soul too) and tarpana can be done to devas (they have a mind too)=
, homam to devas and tarpana to pitris is the most important.
 
If one of t=
he ancestors has some blocking karmas and his/her mind got stuck due to tho=
se desires, that can affect one's mind due to the kaarmik debt. When water =
(mind) with sesame seeds (blocking karmas) is released through certain chak=
ras in the palm with thoughts of freeing an ancestor filling the mind, it c=
an free one's mind from the effects of the blocking karmas by that ancestor=
. Pitri tarpana is a very simple ritual that can help considerably.
 
Best =
regards,
Narasimha
