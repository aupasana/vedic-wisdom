Namaste Sir,

Nice writeup and thanks for forwarding! However, I have an issue with the 
opening paragraph and the overall tone that follows later. I will take a 
slightly different stand.

To show the value of aagamas, one need not put down Gita, Vedas etc. Though 
Vedas and Upanishats are not comprehensible to many Hindus in this age, Gita 
has been a fountain light of wisdom and conviction for many Hindus in this 
age. After all, Krishna taught the essence of Veda and Upanishats in a 
simple form to understand just before Kali Yuga started, for a reason.

Putting down Gita and Vedas to show the value of aagamas is IMHO a wrong 
attitude.

To praise the value of the "physics lab" class, you do not have to put down 
the "physics theory" class. After all, they are related and they are not 
opposites. If the knowledge of physics becomes weak among people (including 
teachers) and the teachings in the "physics theory" and "physics lab" 
classes start to deviate due to corruption in the understanding of teachers, 
then people may start taking the two sides and start fighting about the 
superiority of the one class over the other. But that is a wrong attitude 
and one who thinks that "physics theory" and "physics lab" are independent 
and/or opposites understands neither subject correctly!

The same holds in the case of Gita/Vedas/Upanishats vs Aagamas/tantras 
issue. The above is a perfect analogy for what happened. There is no point 
in putting down either one of them by the other camp. The time has come for 
people to realize that they are two sides of the coin and one helps in a 
better understanding/appreciation of the other.

*        *        *

If you ask me, the reason for India's sanatana dharma being preserved is a 
few liberated sages who are engaged in tapascharya in remote corners of the 
land. Men of absolutely unbelievable spiritual caliber are constantly 
meditating in several places and they are playing their role in the divine 
play of the Mother.

Reciting Veda or Gita and performing Aagamas are excellent things to do, but 
those can only accomplish limited things. There are several who recite Veda 
or Gita, but do not understand the true meaning. There are several who 
perform aagamas, but without the purity of consciousness that comes with a 
true understanding. Such people cannot accomplish much.

On the other hand, when a yogi who understands the essence of Veda and 
Aagama reaches one of the higher realms of consciousness, remains in it for 
a long time and accumulates enough shakti, a mere wish is sufficient to 
change the course of world history. There are many great yogis who are 
immersed in the nectar of the bliss of divine communion, who are fulfilling 
the Divine Will through their wishes and maintaining sanatana dharma. In 
fact, India is set to become a major force in the material plane too (in 
addition to the spiritual) in the coming 100 years. All this is simply 
divine will, executed by the thought power of the Yogis who are in tune with 
the divine will as their own individual ego-consciousness and the resultant 
individual will have fallen off. Some of them are popular and people know 
them, such as Sant Jnaneshwar Maharaj, who is still immersed in constant 
meditation at Alandi and Lord Hanuman, who too is present on earth in his 
physical body and meditating on Lord Rama. But there are also many that we 
do not know of.

As a matter of fact, I will say that the study of Vedas, Upanishats, Gita as 
well as performing of aagamas is still going on in India due to the 
meditation and thought power of such Yogis.

Best regards,
Narasimha
