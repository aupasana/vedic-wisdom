Namaste,
 
I am in North Carolina right now, with limited internet connectivity. I will write more later. But the funny thing is that this is exactly the topic of a project on which Manish and I worked during our India trip in last summer. Manish is busy working on wrapping this project up.

But the problem is that modern Indologists do not accepe that Vyasa lived 5000 years back and he wrote Mahabharata. They think that Mahabharata was put together in 500 BC - 500 AD timeframe! If astronomy proves that the positions given MB really happened 5000 years back and if that strongly suggests that a person having the ability to observe planets actually wrote MB 5000 years back, it is a very big jolt to the standard views of Indologists.
 
Defensive and diffident attitude of Hindu historians and their reluctance to view Hindu historical texts as history stems from concerted efforts by biased European Indologists from old times. When time comes, those early works need to be discredited thoroughly and Hindu consciousness needs to be awakened.
 
I will write more later.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
