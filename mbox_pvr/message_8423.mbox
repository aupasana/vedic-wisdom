Namaste friends,

There is a notion in some circles that sadhana done in smashana 
(cemetary) is more powerful than regular sadhana, for creating changes 
inside and outside. Most such statements in folklore are neither 
entirely incorrect nor fully accurate. One needs the right context and 
perspective to understand.

The microcosm inside us reflects the entire universe. By harnessing the 
ability of consciousness to focus on some things, it may be possible to 
create changes inside and outside. But what that requires is a certain 
state of mind. A densely conditioned mind cannot focus on anything. A 
mind that overcame most of its conditioning can focus well and 
accomplish things.

To remove internal conditioning, we engage in various external practices 
(such as pooja, homam etc). External symbols cause resonance inside and 
modify internal conditioning with time. For example, when we do homam, 
external fire resonates with the internal fire (aspect of consciousness 
that burns conditioning) and one progresses.

Similarly, external smashana where bodies are burnt will cause resonance 
inside consciousness and promote an "internal smashana" where 
conditioning dies, burns and disappears.

Create an internal smashana in your mind, where various types of 
conditioning and various wants, agendas, likes and dislikes are killed 
and put to rest so as to not rise again. Without a good internal 
smashana, sadhana done in an external smashana will not be that 
effective. With a good internal smashana, sadhana done anywhere will be 
very effective.

Yes, for a few, sitting in an external smashana and seeing the play of 
Nature will be conducive to creating an internal smashana. If so, one 
can go and sit in a smashana. But, if one with dense conditioning goes 
to a smashan and does a sadhana with high expectations of certain 
results (spiritual or material), because one read that smashana sadhana 
is powerful for begetting results, one may be deluding oneself.

Just my 2 cents, take it or leave it...

Best regards,
Narasimha
