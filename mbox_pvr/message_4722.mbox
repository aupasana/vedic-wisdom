Traditional pre-Confucian =
Chinese beliefs from the Chinese mythology and Chinese folk religions such =
as Taoism and Shenism coexisted with Confucianism for many centuries. For e=
xample, Han dynasty declared Confucianism as the official state culture and=
 Taoism as the official religion. Thus, worship of deities, demigods, xians=
, supernatural beings (e.g. dragon) and ancestors (pitris!) as practiced in=
 these folk religions were not replaced by Confucian philosophy but they co=
-existed. Moreover, Confucianism stressed honesty, rituals and rites (which=
 extended to proper social behavior), sacrifice and filial piety.
 
Thus, e=
ven if Chinese may not explicitly believe in a specific definition of God, =
an implicit concept of god has influenced the evolution of the value system=
, philosophy and culture they so faithfully followed.
 
*        *        *=

 
Of course, communist rule changed things. Any society has to receive the=
 fruits of its collective karmas when the right time comes.
 
*        *   =
     *
 
I've never been to China, but I went to Seoul, South Korea on offi=
ce work a couple of years back. As I could not do my daily homam in the hot=
el room there, I mentally did the homam procedure in the fire that is withi=
n and then meditated. I felt nice energy as I meditated. Though Korea is no=
t as good as India, it is better than US in spiritual energy. I am quite co=
nvinced that some great souls did excellent sadhana in that area in the pas=
t.

Narasimha

If one gets out of the duality and becomes absorbed in unmanifested Brahman=
