Namaste,

In vedantic terms, ego stands for "I-ness" (sense of "I"). If you 
self-identify with anything, you have an ego. Ego is not there when and only 
when there is no self-identification of any kind, i.e. when one is immersed 
in Brahman without any distinction like "this is I, this is other".

But, in order to exist in a body and function in this world, one needs to 
keep alive atleast a very limited amount of self-identification.

However, in most people, this self-identification is not "a very limited" 
amount, but really huge. We self-identify with a body, name and identity 
quite heavily. The goal is to reduce it and keep it under check, so that it 
is ready to completely melt away oneday.

*        *        *

The only useful purpose of allowing ego (self-identification) to exist is to 
allow one to identify with a body, name etc and use them to do god's work. 
How does one know what god's work one is supposed to do? One knows it 
through one's intuition, one's logical thinkiing and external input like the 
words of a guru or other learned men.

How you decide your dharma - what you are supposed to do in this world - is 
personal and upto you. But, once you decide that, all your actions should be 
centered around that. The level of self-identification should be barely 
sufficient for discharging one's dharma. Any self-identification above that 
level is unneeded and counter-productive. It gets one entangled in 
unnecessary web of karmas.

*        *        *

Suppose I decide that my dharma is to spead homam in the world. Then I 
should use my body, my name, my image, my thoughts and my actions to do what 
is needed for spreading homam in the world. Suppose somebody dismisses homam 
and speaks very deridingly about homam and me. I may argue or ignore. If my 
judgment is that arguing with him and removing the doubts of people is 
better to advance my dharma and spread homam, I should argue. If my judgment 
is that ignoring is better to advance my dharma, I should ignore him. If my 
self-identification with the name and its fame is too strong and it was 
offended by his deriding comments on me and I get back to him just for that 
reason, I am doing something silly and unneeded. Instead, I should look at 
what actions will help me advance my dharma better.

*        *        *

When Swami Vivekananda lived in US for sometime after his celebrated speech 
at the parliament of religions in Chicago, he received some good coverage in 
US newspapers. Some jealous Indian neo-religious leaders conducted a 
campaign of writing letters to the parliament of religions declaring that 
Swami Vivekananda was a fake and that he did not represent Hinduism.

Swamiji was a detached soul who did not care what people thought of him. His 
self-identification with the body, name and image in the world were there 
only to finish his mission of spreading sanatana dharma and vedanta in the 
world. After all, once he finished *his* dharma, he did not look back and 
gave up body.

Still, he did not ignore the taunts and negative letter campaign. He took it 
seriously. If his detractors were taken seriously, it could have derailed 
his mission. He needed thousands of important people from across the world 
to be influenced by him and start vedanta societies in various cities (and 
co-operation from parliament of religions and positive media coverage 
contributed to it). That was *his* dharma as judged by him. So he used his 
body, name and image to engage in actions that fought with his detractors, 
shut them down and advanced his dharma. He requested Ramakrishna's other 
disciples in Calcutta to hold a public meeting and send news clips. Swami 
Abhedananda went from Dakshineshwar to Calcutta, stayed there for a few 
days, invited all spiritual leaders, royals and famous personalities to a 
public meeting, held a public meeting. He ensured that the grand public 
meeting was attended by many famous people and passed a formal resolution 
acknowledging Swami Vivekananda's contributions to Hinduism. News clips from 
Indian news papers were promptly mailed to the parliament of religions 
leaders. All doubts about Vivekananda's authenticity were laid to rest.

If Vivekananda did this out of personal egotism and to feel good about 
himself, he would be binding himself in more entanglements. But, he was 
doing it to advance his chosen dharma, which was far bigger than feeling 
good about himself. So it did not really bind him.

*        *        *

As you said, suppose your superior insults you or is unfair to you. The 
first instinct of a person would be to be hurt or sad or angry or mad. But, 
that is the sign of a overly strong self-identification with a body, name 
and image. What's the big deal if someone calls me names? You, the 
imperishable one, are trapped in this perishable identity (body, name, 
image) *temporarily* just to fulfil some dharma. Identifying with this 
identity just enough to fulfil your dharma is required. But why identify 
more than needed and become angry or sad or mad that someone thinks badly 
about this temporary identity? It is actually quite foolish.

You should think only in terms of your dharma. What is the dharma you are 
working for? What things help it and what things pull it back?

Suppose you decide that one of your dharmas is to take care of your family 
(because there are still unpaid karmik debts). Suppose an unfair comment of 
a superior has a chance of impacting your next performance review, your 
salary or even your job itself, and, as a result, a chance of blocking your 
dharma. Then, the question is what action will advance your dharma better. 
Will you serve your dharma better by ignoring and remaining calm or by 
arguing back? Do whatever helps your chosen dharma more.

But, thinking "he is wrong. He is unfair to *me*" and reacting based on it 
useless, though that is what most people do. As I said above, do not pay too 
much attention to a temporary entity called your identity (body, name and 
image). You are not that. You are something else using 'that' to fulfil some 
dharma. Decide what your dharma is and base your actions in tricky 
situations on their impact on your dharma.

Hope that clarifies a little bit.

Best regards,
Narasimha
