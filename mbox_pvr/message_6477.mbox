Namaste,

Well, most "procedures" do not work today as they are supposed to=
. As 
Kali deepens, rishis have put locks on all procedures and mantras tha=
t 
can be misused. The knowledge has been intentionally corrupted.

However=
, when a person with enough tapassakti really desires, even an 
incorrect m=
antra or a corrupt procedure can produce the desired result. 
Of course, th=
e person will end up wasting tapassakti and/or accumulating 
undesirable ka=
rmas, but that is a different matter.

Most people who do sadhana today do =
not accumulate any shakti. Out of 
the very few who accumulate shakti, a ve=
ry very very small portion 
retain it and grow it for an extended period, d=
o not get tempted by it, 
do not use it for egoistic/selfish reasons and pu=
t it to use for the 
increase of universal dhaarma and progress further tow=
ards 
Self-realization. Others who accumulate shakti put it to use for 
ego=
istic reasons, for themselves or somebody close to them or somebody 
who pa=
ys them (or praises them), etc. Such people never become realized 
and get =
stuck, but they do have the ability to produce small results due 
to the sh=
akti accumulated through sadhana and austerities.

If you have not seen suc=
h people, it does not mean they do not exist!

Of course, it is not a great=
 idea to seek out such people, for all they 
can do is to generate small re=
sults that are temporary in nature. They 
cannot make you a better person o=
r take you to god.

*        *        *

Secondly, fire is a totally differ=
ent ballgame compared to any other 
sadhana. Our scriptures say "agnimukhaa=
 vai devaah (gods are accessible 
through fire)" and such tradition existed=
 in so many religions and 
cultures. All this is not without reason.

Fire =
purifies and fire is the greatest teacher. Merely spending time in 
front o=
f an external fire will increase the internal fire through 
resonance and p=
urify one's thinking.

Even if one does not do homam, merely spending 20 mi=
nutes every day =E2=80=93 or 
an hour or two every week =E2=80=93 meditatin=
g in front of a reasonable size 
fire with a sense of sacredness and revere=
nce, can make a lot of 
difference to one=E2=80=99s state of mind and make =
it more focused, calm and 
peaceful over time. The proof of the pudding is =
in eating it. One can 
try it and see for oneself what it can do.

I will n=
ot guarantee material results (though several people in serious 
troubles s=
olved them by doing homam for a few months), but I can vouch 
that one's me=
ntal condition will change through regular fire ritual.

Best regards,
Nara=
simha
