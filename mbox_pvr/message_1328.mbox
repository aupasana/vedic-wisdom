Namaste,

I understand and appreciate this request.

ITranslator software from Omkaranand Ashram in Himalayas supports Devanagari 
script and Roman script and has support for Vedic intonation marks. 
Unfortunately, I am not aware of any software for Telugu or other Indian 
languages which allows entering intonation marks. The commercial iLeap 
software from C-DAC is good - one can type the text once in English and then 
get it in all Indian languages. But it has no support for intonation marks.

If someone can volunteer to type all the mantras in Telugu (or Tamil or 
Gujarati etc) in iLeap or some other software and save various pieces of 
mantra text as gif pictures and manually add intonation marks (one or two 
vertical lines on top or a horizontal line at bottom) in all mantras, it is 
possible to replace the Devanagari and Roman text in manual with those 
pictures. In fact, if one can translate the entire manual into Telugu and 
other languages and paste the mantras saved as pictures as mentioned 
earlier, it is then possible to have manuals completely in various Indian 
languages. If anybody is interested and has time and energy and understands 
what I am saying, they can volunteer.

Best regards,
Narasimha
