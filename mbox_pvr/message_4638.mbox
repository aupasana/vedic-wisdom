Namaste friends,
 
I will be in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, during August 4-7. I was invited to speak at the 8th international conference of "World Association for VEdic Studies" (WAVES) at the University of West Indies. I will be talking about the relevance of homam as a spiritual sadhana. Some basic event information can be accessed at
 
http://www.umassd.edu/indic/waves2010.cfm
 
If anybody living in Trinidad wants to come and meet me, I will be glad to meet them. I may also be able to show a homam to anybody interested.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
