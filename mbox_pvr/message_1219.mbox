Sir,
I am totally convinced with your lucid explanation. You have mentioned=
 about attendants. Can you please explain this in details? What we mean by =
attendants of higher Deities? This is very interesting so I am asking this.=
 Thanks.
Dr. Rawal

Namaste,
=A0
Orthodox tradit=

=A0
=
Several ethereal beings are sensitive to smell and many of them do not like=
 the smell of menstrual blood and also the aura of normal women in periods =
(if it is a spiritually elevated woman, it is different). Though most highe=
r deities do not care about this, their attendants may be sensitive. When y=
ou do a sadhana, an attendant of a deity may visit at first. One can try to=
 make the visitors comfortable.
=A0
However, there may be so many other off=
ensive things where we do sadhana these days and putting too much stress on=
 one little thing is somewhat unbalanced. You can try to follow tradition i=
f that is possible. Otherwise, don't worry.
=A0
Regarding cooking food, the=
 food we eat now-a-days is so badly corrupted in various ways that being co=
oked by a lady with periods is a very small thing in comparison. Coming int=
o the pooja room is also not a big deal in my view.
=A0
However, when you d=
o homam, I suggest not using food cooked by such a lady if possible. Also I=
 suggest that ladies with periods should not come too close to the fire. Th=
ese are precautionary suggestions only.

Chandipath is fine. The Mother =
does not care much about external things.
=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha
