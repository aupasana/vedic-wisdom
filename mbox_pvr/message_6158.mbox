Dear Sri Narasimha garu, 
=C2=A0
I would like to hear from you, the differ=
ence between these two stotrams and their origins. I know that durga saptha=
sathi is the exploits of devi with mahishasura, chanda, munda, raktabeeja, =
sumba and sumbha rakshasas and Lalita sahasranama praises the mother who sl=
ained Bhandasura. Is there a connection / parallels=C2=A0between these? The=
y are also from two different puranas, so I am bit confused. The reason for=
 this confusion=C2=A0is that the same=C2=A0forms of mother, namely, koumari=
, vaishanavi, siva dooti, aindri and so on are=C2=A0referenced in both. Cou=
ld you please explain more?

=C2=A0 



Na=
maste,

Suppose a child is under the delusion that there is a monster in th=
e 
next room and that the monster will come and hurt him. One may tell him,=
 
"if you close this door, monster won't come" or "if you light this 
brigh=
t light in your room, monster won't come" or "if you stop crying, 
monster =
won't come" or "if you do so and so thing, monster won't come".

The child =
may be afraid of the monster and do several things to prevent 
the monster =
from coming and hurting him. That is a good thing.

But the basic factor is=
 that there is NO monster in the next room! ;-) 
However, if you just decla=
re that to the child, the child will never 
completely overcome the fear. I=
nstead, use the pretext of safety from 
monster to make the child to do som=
e good things. Eventually, the child 
will realize that there is no monster=
.

* * *

Rituals and all sadhanas we do are kind of like the good things t=
he 
child in the analogy does to remain safe from the monster. The notion 
=
that we are not divine and that we experience good and bad things is the 
m=
onster. Just as a monster is very real for the child, this notion is 
very =
real for us. Just pretending bravery that there is no monster will 
not lif=
t the grip of an imaginary monster on the mind.

Do various things to make =
you feel comfortable. But, in the end, the 
monster you are trying to remai=
n safe from does not even exist...

* * *

I do not appreciate those who do=
wnplay rituals and sadhana and say that 
all is god. If you are down with a=
 severe disease or your limbs are cut 
off and you still see god in that su=
ffering and remain in an exalted 
state, then you can claim that all is god=
. Otherwise, all is NOT god for 
you. More sadhana is needed to internalize=
 the theoretical statements.

At the same time, those who enquire about min=
ute details of rituals are 
like an innocent child who asks, "to keep the m=
onster at bay, is it 
better to do my homnework in a red notebook or a blue=
 notebook?" 
Bottomline is that the monster is unreal and it is good to do =
your 
homework irrespective of which notebook you use. As the child learns =

more, works more and grows intellectually, oneday he will realize that 
th=
e monster is unreal.

* * *

I've been busy. I will try to reply to some sp=
ecific questions in 
future. But, the fundamental answer to many questions =
is given above! 
Rest assured that most details being sought are not that i=
mportant. Have 
faith in god, surrender to god and do homam with the faith =
that god IS 
really in fire. Despite any procedural shortcomings, you WILL =
make 
spiritual progress.

Best regards,
Narasimha
