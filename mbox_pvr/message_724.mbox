Namaste,
 
Narayan has already answered aptly.
 
It is ideal if the fire do=
es not go off in the middle. But, if it does, don't worry. Re-ignite it as =
Narayan said, pray to Agni in the mind and continue.
 
Suppose a servant is=
 asked by his master to carry a vessel of milk to a place without spilling =
it on the way. Suppose a little milk is spilled on the way. What should he =
do? Should he abandon the project or atleast carry the remaining milk to th=
e destination?
 
*        *        *
 
As Narayan said, fire going away can=
 signal the bhutagni being weak.
 
But, one is better off ignoring those th=
ings and not thinking too much about the significance.
 
*        *        =
*
 
I recommend doing homam without worrying about how well or badly it wen=
t and what results it brought. Let me give an analogy.
 
Think of your favo=
rite deity as the master and yourself as a servant. A servant simply serves=
 the master. Similarly, all the sadhana you do and your other activities ar=
e your way to serve your master.
 
A rich landlord may be very wealthy and =
have many big checks everyday to cash and also many big checks everyday to =
mail others. Yet, he may need a servant to physically carry papers to the b=
ank and do the needful. Similarly, god is capable of doing anything in this=
 world and yet god needs human beings who execute god's agenda in this worl=
d. That is why various gods (including Vishnu himself) and various rishis k=
eep coming back to earth every now and then. The supreme god of this world =
operates through various physical persons present on earth.
 
We do homam a=
nd other spiritual sadhana, purify ourselves and try to help others, becaus=
e that is god's work. Just as a servant carries master's papers to the bank=
, we do such work for god.
 
Doing what is applauded by others as good work=
 tends to promote ego and we need to guard against it. A servant carrying a=
 million dollar check to the bank and cashing it is NOT superior to a serva=
nt carrying a $100 check to the bank and cashing it. Both are merely doing =
their master's work and do not own anything. Both are just *instruments* us=
ed by the master to carry out his agenda. Similarly, one who does what are =
considered great deeds in this world and one who does what are considered m=
eagre deeds in this world are both servants of god helping god execute god'=
s agenda in this world. Neither really owns anything. One may consider ones=
elf superior to the other because his/her deeds are considered superior by =
the world, but he/she is just as foolish as a servant who considers himself=
/herself superior to another servant carrying something less valuable.
 
If=
 this attitude of being a servant of god fully penetrates one's attitude, t=
hinking and instincts, one is safe no matter what situations his previous k=
armas place one in. One can remain happy and blissful in pleasure and pain,=
 in praise and criticism and in light and darkness.
 
Have the same attitud=
e towards your sadhana like homam. It is a job you are doing for god. You d=
o the best you can. But you own nothing. You are doing it for god.
 
Best r=
egards,
Narasimha

        Dear Narasi=
mhaji

        Reading your response another question came into my mind. Yo=
u said:

         It is not good if fire is extinguished by rain in the mid=
dle of a homam.

        Is it not good that the fire gets extinguished by =
rain, or the fact that the fire is getting extinguished?

        I mean ac=
tyually i feel when someone starts doing homa regularly, there can be insta=
nces when the homa agni gets extinguished while the homa is still on..happe=
ned with me couple of times... i seriously dont knbow what to make of it bu=
t as one member in this list had suggested to me,  i relight the fire and k=
eep continuing with the homa.

        -Regards
         Rajarshi

          Namaste Phani,

   =
       > 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of a house(3-floors) ? Ca=
n a homam
          > kundam made by arranging red bricks, with sand base b=
e used instead of a
          > copper one?

          Yes, you can do it o=
n a rooftop. Doing it in the open is actually better than doing it in close=
d space. But realize that a rain can cause problems. Keep an umbrella aroun=
d to protect the fire if it rains while you are doing homam. It is not good=
 if fire is extinguished by rain in the middle of a homam.

          Yes, =
you can construct a homa kundam with bricks and sand at the bottom. Use a s=
quare shaped huma kunda.

          > 2)While performing the Homam using th=
e mp3 audio file, should one repeat the
          > mantras mentally along =
with the audio?

          One can repeat mentally while listening attentiv=
ely (not casually). Actually, even listening to mantras with all the attent=
ion focused is as powerful as saying mantras.

          Suppose person X i=
s chanting a mantra and thinking of some mundane matter in the mind. Suppos=
e person Y is listening to it with focus and thinking of the mantra and its=
 deity. Then the mantra may do nothing for person X and yet person Y may be=
nefit from the mantra. The word mantra means "one that protects the mind"..=
 One can say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be protected. The key is co=
ntrol over the mind and keeping the mind focused on the mantra.

          =
However, there is a difference between meditation and homam. Mantra is subm=
itted in the internal fire in meditation and it is submitted in the externa=
l fire as well in a homam. So making some external sound (even if feeble) i=
s a good idea as opposed to silent chanting or just listening. Try to repea=
t slowly.

          > 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Other co=
nditions/niyamas that
          > should be followed apart from having vege=
terain food?

          Yes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread ceremo=
ny) has been performed can do it. Bachelor or married is irrelevant.

     =
     One should follow the yamas and niyamas set by one's guru. Whatever ru=
les one's guru sets, one should follow them strictly. At the minimum, one s=
hould eat only vegetarian food on the day of homam and take a bath before h=
omam. Another rule I will recommend is to avoid eating any solid food 2 hou=
rs before homam.

          By the way, if one without a sacred thread want=
s to do homam for spiritual progress, I am willing to take responsibility a=
nd allow them to do it. Such a person can think of me or my guru as guru an=
d perform homam. I am willing to take on any karma incurred in the process =
until the person crosses some minimum threshhold of purity through homam an=
d other spiritual practices. Sacred thread or no sacred thread, mantropades=
a or no mantropadesa, it does not matter after a while, when the person cro=
sses a threshhold of purity. The goal of upanayanam and other mantropadesa =
by guru is to speed this up and make the person cross the threshhold of pur=
ity.

          As long as one desires no specific material benefits (and r=
eady to receive whatever god gives) and does homam for spiritual progress, =
I am willing to help, even if it means some suffering for me.

          > =
4)Any good date to start the Homam? or any day would be fine?

          Fo=
r Mahaganapathi homam, the best is a Chaturthi morning. But any day is fine=
 really.

          * * *

          Mentioning rain and rooftop homam remi=
nded me of my India trip.

          When I went to India in May 2008, I an=
d my guru Manish traveled together to several places (on a specific project=
). We ended up doing homam in the morning in several places (wherever we we=
re). Before the trip, my guru told me to carry an umbrella with me. As mons=
oons come only in June/July in India, I did not take it seriously. We were =
in New Delhi in mid-May.. We proceeded to the rooftop of the apartment comp=
lex we were in, to do a homam. Manish told me, "Narasimha, it is going to r=
ain heavily in this city after our homam finishes". I just smiled.

       =
   To my surprise, it did rain as soon as our homas finished. After we offe=
red poornaahuti, it suddenly started raining with really big drops. Luckily=
, there was a small towel/blanket on the rooftop close to us. Together, we =
held it on top of the two small homa kundas, closed our eyes and meditated.=
 We held the cloth cover on the homa kundas until fire in the two homa kund=
as went off and then packed everything and went down. We left for Kurukshet=
ra later that day, but we were told that a heavy rain continued for a few d=
ays in New Delhi. In fact, rain followed us on that trip as we covered the =
north, east and west of India. It rained in every place we went to, as we f=
inished our task in that place and prepared to move on.

          Best reg=
ards,

          <DIV>Namaste Phani,<BR><BR>> 1)Can Homam be performed o=
n the roof 
          top of a house(3-floors) ? Can a homam<BR>> kundam=
 made by 
          arranging red bricks, with sand base be used instead of=
 a<BR>> 
          copper one?<BR><BR>Yes, you can do it on a rooftop. D=
oing it in the 
          open is actually better than doing it in closed s=
pace. But realize 
          that a rain can cause problems. Keep an umbrel=
la around to protect the 
          fire if it rains while you are doing ho=
mam. It is not good if fire is 
          extinguished by rain in the middl=
e of a homam.<BR><BR>Yes, you can 
          construct a homa kundam with b=
ricks and sand at the bottom. Use a 
          square shaped huma kunda.<BR=
><BR>> 2)While performing the Homam 
          using the mp3 audio file,=
 should one repeat the<BR>> mantras 
          mentally along with the a=
udio?<BR><BR>One can repeat mentally while 
          listening attentively=
 (not casually). Actually, even listening to 
          mantras with all th=
e attention focused is as powerful as saying 
          mantras.<BR><BR>Sup=
pose person X is chanting a mantra and thinking of 
          some mundane =
matter in the mind. Suppose person Y is listening to it 
          with foc=
us and thinking of the mantra and its deity. Then the mantra 
          may=
 do nothing for person X and yet person Y may benefit from the 
          m=
antra. The word mantra means "one that protects the mind".. One can 
      =
    say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be protected. The key is 
      =
    control over the mind and keeping the mind focused on the 
          ma=
ntra.<BR><BR>However, there is a difference between meditation and 
       =
   homam. Mantra is submitted in the internal fire in meditation and it 
  =
        is submitted in the external fire as well in a homam. So making som=
e 
          external sound (even if feeble) is a good idea as opposed to s=
ilent 
          chanting or just listening. Try to repeat slowly.<BR><BR>&=
gt; 3)Can 
          bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Other conditions=
/niyamas 
          that<BR>> should be followed apart from having veget=
erain 
          food?<BR><BR>Yes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread =
ceremony) 
          has been performed can do it. Bachelor or married is 
=
          irrelevant.<BR><BR>One should follow the yamas and niyamas set by=
 
          one's guru. Whatever rules one's guru sets, one should follow t=
hem 
          strictly. At the minimum, one should eat only vegetarian foo=
d on the 
          day of homam and take a bath before homam. Another rule=
 I will 
          recommend is to avoid eating any solid food 2 hours befo=
re 
          homam.<BR><BR>By the way, if one without a sacred thread want=
s to do 
          homam for spiritual progress, I am willing to take respo=
nsibility and 
          allow them to do it. Such a person can think of me=
 or my guru as guru 
          and perform homam. I am willing to take on a=
ny karma incurred in the 
          process until the person crosses some m=
inimum threshhold of purity 
          through homam and other spiritual pr=
actices. Sacred thread or no 
          sacred thread, mantropadesa or no m=
antropadesa, it does not matter 
          after a while, when the person c=
rosses a threshhold of purity. The 
          goal of upanayanam and other =
mantropadesa by guru is to speed this up 
          and make the person cro=
ss the threshhold of purity.<BR><BR>As long as 
          one desires no sp=
ecific material benefits (and ready to receive 
          whatever god give=
s) and does homam for spiritual progress, I am 
          willing to help, =
even if it means some suffering for me.<BR><BR>> 
          4)Any good d=
ate to start the Homam? or any day would be 
          fine?<BR><BR>For Mah=
aganapathi homam, the best is a Chaturthi morning. 
          But any day i=
s fine really.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Mentioning rain and 
          rooftop h=
omam reminded me of my India trip.<BR><BR>When I went to 
          India i=
n May 2008, I and my guru Manish traveled together to several 
          pl=
aces (on a specific project). We ended up doing homam in the morning 
     =
     in several places (wherever we were). Before the trip, my guru told me=
 
          to carry an umbrella with me. As monsoons come only in June/Jul=
y in 
          India, I did not take it seriously. We were in New Delhi in=
 mid-May.. 
          We proceeded to the rooftop of the apartment complex =
we were in, to do 
          a homam. Manish told me, "Narasimha, it is goi=
ng to rain heavily in 
          this city after our homam finishes". I jus=
t smiled.<BR><BR>To my 
          surprise, it did rain as soon as our homa=
s finished. After we offered 
          poornaahuti, it suddenly started ra=
ining with really big drops. 
          Luckily, there was a small towel/bl=
anket on the rooftop close to us. 
          Together, we held it on top of=
 the two small homa kundas, closed our 
          eyes and meditated. We he=
ld the cloth cover on the homa kundas until 
          fire in the two homa=
 kundas went off and then packed everything and 
          went down. We le=
ft for Kurukshetra later that day, but we were told 
          that a heavy=
 rain continued for a few days in New Delhi. In fact, rain 
          follo=
wed us on that trip as we covered the north, east and west of 
          In=
dia. It rained in every place we went to, as we finished our task in 
     =
     that place and prepared to move on.<BR><BR>Best
