Namaste,

Dear PVR N ji first of all, I apologize if I am being rude by int=
erfering in 
conversation between you two elders. 



To Jyoish group Arun =
ji,

To narrow down the conversation let me  make some points here:-

i) Ar=
e you saying that Shiva/ durga / chandi or Kali are Tamasik deities?
 Let=
=E2=80=99s understand that different people have different opinions about t=
he guans 
of deities. These arguments are as good as the arguments =E2=80=
=9Clike who is the 
creator of world =E2=80=93 The Shakti Worshippers say I=
ts Devi, Vaishanavas Say its Maha 
Vishnu, Shaivists say its Bhagvan Shiv o=
r Shankar and Ganapatyas Say its Lord 
Ganapati .. etc so  each sect of fol=
lowers have their own conception or 
presumptions about the deities. So let=
=E2=80=99s not over rule each others views. Their 
own believes are good fo=
r them. If some of them (views) don=E2=80=99t apply to us let=E2=80=99s 
no=
t take it but let=E2=80=99s not oppose others who are comfortable with it.
=
And its my personal view is that if we have full faith on whatever deity or=
 any 
small energy too then it can lead us to realization of ultimate which=
 is devoid 
of all gunas the initial gunas that are blamed (aropit =E2=80=
=93 or arop) to them are 
immaterial when realized in full.  

Hence the ab=
ove blamed =E2=80=9CTamasik=E2=80=9D tag does not applies to them, as- for =
the 
follower of them they are saattvik only. And for your info if you need=
 any 
details of temples where these deities (above mentioned deities) are =
considered 
and worshipped as saattvik deities I can assist you with same.
=

ii) Are you saying that Tamasik deities cannot be or should not be worship=
ped in 
Saattvik ways?
Let me say clearly that any deity can be worshipped =
in any way as per the will 
and the strength of the bhakta or worshipper. T=
here are no hard and fast rules 
for bhakti or worship.
Every =E2=80=9CSaat=
vik=E2=80=9D (I would say tagged as saattvik) deity can be worshipped in 
T=
amasik or rajasik way and so is for rajasik or Tamasik deities. Whatever th=
e 
way you worship them it is your bhakti and samarpana bhav that is going =
to 
matter and not what way you worship.
 
iii) You are saying that =E2=80=
=9CTantra=E2=80=9D is Tamasik??? 
Here I think the real meaning or definiti=
on of tantra is not known. 
We can say that what we call as the pooja or ho=
ma is also a type of tantra. 
There is no bigger difference in tantra or po=
oja. The method followed is same 
where as the mantras and ingredients used=
 may vary depending on the worshipper 
or the deities or as per the path fo=
llowed by the worshipper.
If you want an example of saattvik tantras: pleas=
e go ahead and see the places 
where His holiness Shri Jagadguru Shankarach=
arya ji=E2=80=9D has installed =E2=80=9CShri=E2=80=9D 
Chakras which are st=
ill being worshipped by respective matths with its chakra 
pooja paddhhati =
(And for your info all matths of shakaracharya ji follow Rig 
Veda as the p=
rimary and though other Vedas also taught to the students, the 
pooja kaink=
aryas are carried out as per the Rig Veda methods). 

 
iv) About Tamasik p=
aths (or Vaama chara) following: methods of getting stronger 
by weakening =
of enemies: 

The ultimate goal of any path whether it is Saattvik or Tamas=
ik or Rajasik 
whichever it is to realize the ultimate truth and there is n=
othing that 
encourages harming other creatures for self benefit (Let me st=
ress the point 
that =E2=80=93 there is no encouragement for harming any cr=
eature forget harming any 
person or enemy. and it is quite clearly mention=
ed that  if anything like that 
is done then it carries burden of big karma=
 and instead of causing liberation it 
will end up binding down the person =
to earthly or below earthly life)
The point is if somebody misuses any genu=
ine knowledge then it is not fault of 
that knowledge. But then for this mi=
suse, that knowledge is not to be blamed. 
And let me tell you very frankly=
 that any knowledge whether it is tagged as 
saattvik or Tamasik or rajasik=
 can be misused in similar ways as it has been 
with the so called =E2=80=
=9CTamasik=E2=80=9D knowledge.
And finally the meaning of weakening of enem=
ies does not mean the enemies who 
are in outside world but ones within us =
that are -Kama, krodha, lobha, moha, 
mada, matsara (The ari-shad-vairies)-=
 winning of which is important in order to 
move towards the realization of=
  ultimate. 


*****
Hope this helps for some extent.


 
Thanks & Regards,=

Chetan

Namaste,

Creatio=

Vishnu has a=

Rudra, Chandi, Shiva etc are NOT "arch de=

We started this conversation because you "condemned" homam to Shiva=
 as 
it is not given in any scripture according to you. When shown ample 
r=
eferences, you bemoaned that taamasik deities should not be worshipped 
wit=
h saattwik methods and said homam to taamasik deities should include 
"mens=
truation blood, meat, fish, alcohol" etc. Now you are making them 
out to b=
e demons. See my note in the other mail on gunas.

> If you really wants to=
 promote homa then do it for sattavik deities

If YOU have faith in=
 saattwik deities, you worship saattwik deities. We 
WILL enable people to =
worship various deities (including Shiva!) in 
fire, in a saattwik manner.

Vaama maarga is not just consuming alcohol and fish. You=
r understanding 
of vaama maarga is pitiable. It is not that you just have =
fun and a 
deluded demonic deity who also likes fun comes along and helps y=
ou.

We say "all is Brahman" and yet we treat some things as pure and some =
as 
impure. Vaama maarga is about taking something considered impure and 
b=
eing able to actually view it as Brahman and not as a limited thing 
that e=
vokes attraction or aversion in mind. It is about removing 
attraction and =
aversion for various things from the mind completely and 
liberating one. V=
aama maarga is not for all and certainly not for those 
who want to enjoy a=
lcohol, fish etc.

<p cla=

that if we have full faith on whatever deity or any small energy too then =
it

Rudra, Chandi, Shiva etc are NOT "arch demons"!<br>
<br>
We started this=
 conversation because you "condemned" homam to Shiva as <br>
it is not give=
n in any scripture according to you. When shown ample <br>
references, you =
bemoaned that taamasik deities should not be worshipped <br>
with saattwik =
methods and said homam to taamasik deities should include <br>
"menstruatio=
n blood, meat, fish, alcohol" etc. Now you are making them <br>
out to be d=
emons. See my note in the other mail on gunas.<br>
<br>

<b=
r>
If YOU have faith in saattwik deities, you worship saattwik deities. We =
<br>
WILL enable people to worship various deities (including Shiva!) in <b=
r>
fire, in a saattwik manner.<br>
<br>

<br>
Vaama maarga is not just consuming alcohol and=
 fish. Your understanding <br>
of vaama maarga is pitiable. It is not that =
you just have fun and a <br>
deluded demonic deity who also likes fun comes=
 along and helps you.<br>
<br>
We say "all is Brahman" and yet we treat som=
e things as pure and some as <br>
impure. Vaama maarga is about taking some=
thing considered impure and <br>
being able to actually view it as Brahman =
and not as a limited thing <br>
that evokes attraction or aversion in mind.=
 It is about removing <br>
attraction and aversion for various things from =
the mind completely and <br>
liberating one. Vaama maarga is not for all an=
d certainly not for those <br>
who want to enjoy alcohol, fish etc.<br>
