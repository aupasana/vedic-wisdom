Namaste,
 
Yes, when shakti is flowing in one, such things *are* possible. =
If one is able to contain the shakti, it will not happen. If shakti is flow=
ing and one is unable to contain it, such things can happen. It does seem l=
ike you have an awakened and active shakti.
 
However, you are wise to not =
attribute it to yourself and try to not even think about it!
 
Having done =
so much sadhana in this and prior lives to get a little bit of experience, =
people often let the experience bind them and block them from going further=
! That is sad.
 
If one becomes possessive about an experience or thinks of=
 it as an achievement or thinks of it as a vindication of one's superiority=
/progress or otherwise develops *any* kind of attachment to the experience,=
 then one gets stuck. This is a common pitfall with various experiences. A =
true sadhaka should have complete surrender to the cosmic being and not all=
ow the mind to think of *anything* as "mine" or "I did it". Any attachment =
or possessiveness about something - whether it is regarding a material obje=
ct such as a car or a wife or a child or body or whether it is regarding so=
me knowledge such as physics or astrology or mantra shastra or whether it i=
s regarding an experience such as seeing a deity or talking to a deity or h=
earing a mantra internally or something like you described - only promotes =
personal ego and binds one. The only way to progress further is to reduce p=
ersonal ego further and not let the mind think of anything as "mine".
 
*  =
      *        *
 
Mind's nature is to look at the objects of the world and=
 accumulate objects into a big pile labeled as "mine". This is very difficu=
lt to fight.
 
When I went to India this summer, I and my guru visited seve=
ral places together. When I was at a specific place, there were some nice e=
xperiences - probably my best experiences in this life so far. I realized s=
ome things. I had a strong sense of belonging and felt that that place was =
mine and I used that place to do much work in my past life. After feeling t=
hose emotions for a few seconds, I immediately realized my folly. Forget th=
e past life, even my body, my belongings, my achievements and my actions in=
 *this* life are all not really mine. They belong to Her and I am just a te=
mporary caretaker, like a servant takes care of the properties of a rich la=
ndlord. The goal of sadhana is to cut off the remaining ego and attachment =
so that that realization becomes complete. Given that, what is the point is=
 bloating that ego by digging previous attachments that were long forgotten=
? Whatever I was in the last life, whatever I built and whatever I did is n=
ot mine. It was not mine then and it is not mine now. She did it using me t=
hen and it was surrendered to Her. It is Hers even now. Once this confusion=
 cleared, I could focus and have a nice meditation session.
 
One should be=
 very vigilant about the kind of thoughts that enter mind. A feeble thought=
 today, when not checked carefully, may become a strong thought later and c=
ause problems.
 
In your case, please do not think about your experience an=
d keep focusing on the sound of the mantra or on a vision of deity.
 
Best =
regards,
Narasimha

  Dear N=
arasimha ji,
  Namaskar.
  I am happy that something *positive* emerged!!!
=
  Thank you for your guidance,
  one other thing I wished to ask you and wo=
uld you please answer if time permits?
  One of my friends accidently touch=
ed the chair I was sitting in and felt a jolt of charge a few days back but=
 I did not attribute it to myself. A couple of days back she casually touch=
ed me on the shoulder and immediately retracted it saying it was like touch=
ing a live wire. Is it also due to the experiencing of the mantra? 

  Sorr=
y to have asked you to interpret personal experiences but I am clueless and=
 highly appreciative of the enormous *knowledge* of practise of spiritualit=
y you have rather than mere mouthing of wis(e)dom we get to see these days,=


  Regards

  =EF=BB=BF

  Namaste Nalini ji,

  Most people do not experience a mantra. They just =
mechanically chant it and nothing happens. What you described tells me that=
 you were able to experience the manta to some extent. That is a good sign.=


  Though I have never done the mantra you mentioned, from the name, I wou=
ld imagine that this mantra makes energy flow in pingala nadi.

  Different=
 mantras, when they work, force energy to flow in different subtle channel =
of energy flow in our subtle body, resulting in the perception of a differe=
nt "experience" to "self". Some mantras (e.g. tryambakam yajaamahe) are ext=
remely cooling and made energy flow in Ida (Chandra) nadi. Some mantras (e.=
g. Savitri Gayatri) make it flow in Pingala (Surya) nadi.

  When merely so=
me vaayu (movement of air) enters a nadi also, there is some experience. Wh=
en the entire energy of self-awareness (aka Kundalini) enters a nadi, it is=
 a very powerful experience and one's perception of self alters drastically=
.

  There are thousands of nadis in the body and thousands of possible exp=
eriences. The key is to NOT be distracted by the experience. Mystical exper=
iences are signs of spiritual progress, but they are also traps where we ca=
n get stuck (i.e. not progress further). Do not think much about the experi=
ence. In a normal wakeful experience, our senses perceive various objects o=
f the external world. We know that all that is just superficial and the rea=
lity within all of them (i.e. Brahman) is imperceptible to senses. Similarl=
y, whatever our inward-directed senses perceive (e.g. vision of a being, so=
und of a mantra, feeling of heat from fire engulfing one etc) in an intense=
 meditation session is ALSO superficial (though perhaps less superficial th=
an the objects we see in the external world usually) and the reality within=
 those experiences (i.e. Brahman) is experienced only when you transcend th=
e superficial sense experiences.

  While it is difficult, the right thing =
to do when you feel like you described is to ignore it and keep the intense=
 mental focus on the mantra or on the deity. The good thing is that your ex=
perience is a sign of spiritual progress and the bad thing is that it can d=
istract you from the final goal.

  Feeling hot while and *after* meditatio=
n and fighting are signs of some diturbation in the pingala nadi. When the =
corresponding karmas are flushed out of the system, things may be fine.

  =
I am not really knowledgeable. With my guru's blessings, I have experienced=
 some things and realized some things. Then he told me to not hold back and=
 boldly declare answers to questions on spirituality and religion as if I j=
ust know. I just follow his word and do as he said. It is upto my guru and =
the Mother to impregnate my words with meaning as they are received by peop=
le. From my end, I just type out whatever comes to my mind...

  Best regar=
ds,
  Narasimha

          Dear Nalini

          Sorry for interr=
upting in your question to Narasimha.Your mail reminded me of a similar inc=
ident. I have a friend who does very severe japa of a mantra she had reciev=
ed in a dream. It was a strange dream where she saw a little girl, naked, c=
ome and sit on her lap and when she asked teh girl who she (the girl) was, =
the reply came in sanskrit. Now my friend does not know or even understand =
Sanskrit, so she could not understand what the girl was saying. Then after =
some time the girl in the dream kept repeating what sounded like a mantra i=
n her ears.

          From next day morning my friend started chanting tha=
t mantra, after about one and half years of chanting recently she did a san=
kalpa for chanting and had experinces similar to the kind u described. She =
felt her whole body was internally burning, though there was no fever. Her =
relation with her mom started getting bitter with constant fights etc..

  =
        Later after some days it reduced again. I think this maybe a way th=
e karmas are cut off from you. I am not sure of course, Narasimha can tell =
you better. He much more knowledgeable in  these things.

            Dear All,
            Namaskar.

   =
         Yes, indeed.
            I had a doubt that I wanted to ask Narasi=
mha garu. I recited Sree Hanumathbadabanala stotram some time back. I had a=
n unusual experience of 'being on fire', during the initial stages. It was =
as if I was engulfed in a ball of fire, which slowly receded over time. I h=
ad a similar experience during the Navaratri puja when reciting
           =
 Devi kavacham. I still have that feeling of an aura of fire around me and =
feel extremely hot and sweat even in the cold weather. This stays on for a =
time. I also had to face extreme circumstances in 'relationships' that matt=
er to me and there is a steady deterioration, almost as if a heavy veil has=
 been torn asunder. 
            I vaguely remember Narasimha ji telling us=
 in some forum that there might be some ramifications relating to karma tha=
t could manifest when/ after sadhana/worship.
            Could you please =
clarify, Narasimha garu?

              =

 nice!

                    Friends,

                    Lord Hanuman is o=
ne who fully overcame lust. He can be worshipped for giving 
              =
      self-control.

control over senses (hrishika + isha =3D 
                    lord of sense=
s). He can be worshipped for control over senses.

                    Moth=
er Kaali gives dispassion and kills the root of desires. She can be 
      =
              worshipped for getting rid of desires.

                    S=

                   not going to be one magic bullet that does it, but a com=

emotions for a few seconds, I immediately realized my folly. Forget the pa=

are all not really mine. They belong to Her and I am just a temp=

sadhana is to cut off the remaining ego and attachment =
so that that realization 
becomes complete. Given that, what is the point i=

previous attachments that were long forgott=

whatever I built and whatever I =
did is not mine. It was not mine then and 
it is not mine now. She did it u=

  <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>There are thousands of nadis in the b=

  also traps where we can get stuck (i.e. not progress fu=
rther). Do not think 
  much about the experience. In a normal wakeful expe=
rience, our senses perceive 
  various objects of the external world. We kn=
ow that all that is just 
  superficial and the reality within all of them =
(i.e. Brahman) is imperceptible 
  to senses. Similarly, whatever our inwar=
d-directed senses perceive (e.g. 
  vision of a being, sound of a mantra, f=
eeling of heat from fire engulfing one 
  etc) in an intense meditation ses=
sion is ALSO superficial (though perhaps less 
  superficial than the objec=

<DIV>Sorry for interrupting in your question to Narasimha.Your mail 
      =
    reminded me of a similar incident. I have a friend who does very 
=
          severe japa of a mantra she had recieved in a dream. It was a str=
ange 
          dream where she saw a little girl, naked, come and sit on h=
er lap and 
          when she asked teh girl who she (the girl) was, the r=
eply came in 
          sanskrit. Now my friend does not know or even under=
stand Sanskrit, so 
          she could not understand what the girl was sa=
ying. Then after some 
          time the girl in the dream kept repeating =
what sounded like a mantra 
          in her ears.</DIV>
          <DIV><FO=
NT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
          <DIV>From next day m=
orning my friend started chanting that mantra, 
          after about one a=
nd half years of chanting recently she did a sankalpa 
          for chanti=
ng and had experinces similar to the kind u described. She 
          felt =
her whole body was internally burning, though there was no fever. 
        =
  Her relation with her mom started getting bitter with constant fights 
  =
        etc..</DIV>
          <DIV> </DIV>
          <DIV>Later after =
some days it reduced again. I think this maybe a way 
          the karmas =
are cut off from you. I am not sure of course, Narasimha 
          can tel=
l you better. He much more knowledgeable in  these 
          things.<=
