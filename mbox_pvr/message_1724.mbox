Namaste,

Very good and all the best!

(1) Akshatas and flowers can be thrown away in trash.

(2) Ash of havan is ideally collected for a while and then thrown in a river 
or ocean when you accumulate a good amount. One can also bury it in one's 
house, but the best is to distribute it to Nature by throwing in flowing 
water.

(3) You can give it animals or birds. If not, just throw it in trash.

Best regards,
Narasimha
