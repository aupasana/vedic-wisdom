Namaste friends,
 
The documentary movie "Krishna: History or Myth" made by Dr Manish Pandit of Saraswati Films (also the person behind the nascent "Do Homam Yourself" movement) is available now in lower resolution for a free viewing on
 
http://tinyurl.com/krishnareal (tinyurl dot com slash krishnareal) 
or
http://www.saraswatifilms.org/movies.php
 
It is 34 min in length. If you are interested, please visit the site and view it. Also, please try to SPREAD THE WORD! By the way, I was involved in the making of this movie.

The movie looks at the legend of Krishna and archaeological, astronomical and other evidences for the Mahabharat war. This is the first movie made by Saraswati Films. Manish bought a pro camera and other equipment, learnt how to use them, bought a mac book and editing software and learnt how to use them. He shot everything himself, helped by only one person (me), except in one schedule where we had more people to help. He did a lot of hard work to make this happen. Though this movie could have been better, this was the best we could do at that time. We learnt while making this. BTW, the DVD is better in resolution and quality than the internet version, but the latter is decent too.
 
This is just the beginning. We intend to make movies on spiritual themes in coming years, throw light on some ignored areas and spread some important spiritual messages. Honestly, we are still finding our bearings, refining our message and sophisticating our technique. The second movie "Indian Jesus" is nearly ready and may be released next year. It addresses religious harmony, the difference between religion and spirituality and the importance of experience vs faith.
