Namaste,
 
> Are you mentally a sane person?
 
The small paragraph I wrote =
at the end "Restraint is shakti" was purposely written by me. It is not rea=
lly directed at Lalit Mishra, but at people who may feel provoked by what h=
e wrote. One person wrote to me saying "As my nature normally is, I felt li=
ke sending a stinker to that Lalit Mishra, but then remebered your words, S=
haktih is restraint".
 
Insulting someone (no matter who it is and how one =
behaves) or such negative actions should be done only when one is clear abo=
ut why one is doing the action and what higher dharma one is trying to serv=
e. Otherwise, negative actions achieve nothing but wasting one's shakti.
 
=
Restraint can first be practiced in external actions. Eventually, restraint=
 in mental thoughts also comes. Finally, even instincts become restrained. =
It is a long struggle, but worth it. If one does not practice restraint (fr=
om lust, from anger, from greed, from jealosy etc), one is a slave of one's=
 inborn instincts and cannot progress further.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
