Namaste,
 
It is probably the same person. Manish also told me that he met =
an old person who met Aswaththama on the bank of Narmada, after which he be=
came very spiritual.

        Dear =
Sir,
        After reading this mail on Bhartuhari, I would like to write o=
ne experience narrated by an old man to me before 20 years. This happened w=
hile his Parikrama of River Narmada. While walking at night near Narmada ri=
ver he met with one tall man of 10 feet height with long hair. He introduce=
d himself as Ashwasthama and he talked with that learned gentleman who was =
pious by heart. They both talked in Sanskrit only.  Ashwasthama first told =
him that I am Ashwasthama of Mahabharat. I am suffering constant pain from =
my forehead Scar which is never to be cured as Lord Krishna has cursed me. =
Please give me some curd or butter. (Dehi me kinchit Dadhi va Navanitam). 
=
        This is a fact and not immaginory story as the person who told me h=
is experience was 70 years old at that time and he was a noble and purehear=
ted person
