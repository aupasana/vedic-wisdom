Namaste,
 
(1) It means: "by just reading Kunjika stotra, one gets the results of chanting Durga Saptashati".
 
(2) It means: "If one reads Devi Saptashati without reading Kunjika stotra, one will not get siddhi (accomplishment) and his chanting is like crying in a forest [useless activity]".
 
*        *        *
 
I suggest not taking the above literally and worrying.
 
If one studies Kunjika Stotra (aka "Siddha Kunjika Stotra"), one will see that it is filled with beejas of several forms of divine Mother and the moola mantra contains powerful beejas and phrases. I am afraid it is a coded prayer. It contains hints in coded form for several specific sadhanas to get specific results using Devi Saptashati.
 
>From that point of view, one can understand why it says there is no siddhi without Kunjika stotra. However, one will almost certainly not get siddhi by merely chanting Kunjika stotra or adding it to one's Saptashati chanting. In fact, siddhi often comes to those who do not consciously pursue it.
 
*        *        *
 
If one says "just spending time with your mother and expressing your love and respect for her will not give you her wealth. You need her checkbook to access her wealth", that is not incorrect. But that is not the complete story. Just by having the checkbook of one's mother, one may not be able to get her wealth. Check needs her signature. On the other hand, a simple child who does not consciously or explicitly try to get the wealth of one's mother and only spends time with mother expressing love and respect from her may end up getting her wealth when she decides by herself to give.
 
In fact, I suggest not being a son who looks to get mother's wealth by laying hands on her checkbook. Just cultivate love for mother and devote yourself to her. A mother knows what to give and when.
 
Just chanting saptashati is quite useful.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
