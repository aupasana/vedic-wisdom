a follower of AOL's spiritual practices and as a disciple and devotee of Sr=

standing.

at-Chit-Ananda. Some are ritualistic, some use austerities, some use devoti=
on, etc. AOL is a path, where the path to Bliss is also blissful. That does=
 not make it in any way inferior to paths of austerities. As Sri Aurobindo =
would call it, it is a "Sunlit path". In this path one does not suddenly em=
erge into SatChitAnanda. The personality of the sadhak is transformed slowl=
y and the sadhak radiates more and more as they progress more and more.

a yoga and Gnana yoga. Spritual practice in AOL is not just doing Sudarshan=
 Kriya everyday as it is commonly (mis)understood. Pranayams and Sudarshan =
Kriya are done for cleansing and settling of the mind and preparing for med=
itation and doing other spiritual practices of contemplation, Seva for rest=

tary on Bhakti Sutras runs to 30 or so tapes and the publicly available com=
mentary on Ashtavakra gita runs to over 33 DVD episodes! Besides daily stud=

atsangs.

 about lack of a Sadhguru at every stage.

> Let me clarify from my perso=
nal experiences that Sri Sri Ravishankar is a fully Enlightened Master livi=
ng in Sahaj Samadhi all times. He is capable of guiding millions of devotee=
s in every step of the sadhana without having to be near them in person. Se=
veral get necessary guidance in dreams (I myself had that experience twice)=
, some in person and several via various other ways. However, to get these =
guidance, an inner connection with the Master is essential. Until that stag=
e, the various AOL courses, Sri Sri's elaborate and in-depth commentaries o=
n various Knowledge are more than enough to guide disciples to a stage wher=
e conscious inner communion with Guru can be established.
> 
> Several of t=
he senior AOL teachers (mostly Swamis and Rishis) are yogis of a very high =
order capable of reaching SatChitAnanda consciousness at will during medita=
tion. They may be not fully established in it like Sri Sri, but act as chan=
nels of the SatGuru and can appropriate guide a Sadhak as and when needed.

> Regarding AOL charging money for its courses: AOL is world'=
s largest volunteer run organization. Neither AOL teachers nor its founder =
Sri Sri Ravishankar make monitory profits. All the proceeds go to the chari=
table activities again run by volunteers. Many of the full time teachers ha=
ve given up veyr lucrative careers and millions worth in property to become=
 teachers and teach for free. Sri Sri Ravishankar neither needs all the mon=
ey. All senior AOL teachers including Sri Sri have went through very bad an=
d sometimes even dangerous conditions to bring the Knowledge to the masses.=
 This is a time when the highest Knowledge needs to be revealed to maximum =
number of people.
> 
> Senior AOL teachers have faced danger to their lives=
 by going without any help or guidance to areas infested with naxalites, te=
rrorists in North East, Kashmir, Iraq, Palestine, Pakitan, Sri Lanka, etc. =
with nothing but love and Divine Grace as their aid.
> 
> As far as I know,=
 money is charged in AOL courses for two reasons.
> 
> 1) Past experience s=
howed that those that paid for the courses seem to follow the practices mor=
e diligently. It is Sri Sri's guidance that no deserving person should be d=
enied a course because they cannot afford to pay. As a volunteer, I was par=
t of organizing several AOL courses and know first hand many cases where pe=
ople took courses for free and were also provided free accommodation, etc. =
Whenever natural disaster strikes, AOL teachers go there paying from their =
own pocket or by AOL and teach courses for free and provide healing to the =
victims. AOL does not advertise it or make a show of it.
> 
> 2) This is my=
 understanding and not AOl position. It removes the Karmic debt to the AOL =
teachers and volunteers who still may have some doership in them.
> 
> Fina=
lly, Sri Sri is only interested in getting everyone turn inwards and expres=
s the love, joy and compassion that is inside everyone. As long as one foll=
ows a path, any path and surrenders to any Sat Guru, we are happy.

aayaama and kapaalabhaati are badly needed in today's stressed out world. H=
owever, I see this as something that relieves physical and emotional stress=
 and enables better spiritual sadhana, rather than something that enables s=
piritual realization.

or raising Kundalini forcefully (e.g. bandhas such as Jalandhara bandha). B=
ut, with such techniques, one is playing with fire. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa=
 discouraged his disciples (e.g. Swami Abhedananda and Swami Yogananda) fro=
m Hatha yoga and other Raja yoga practices, telling them to stay away from =
practices that emphasize the body and to absorb the mind in god'a name inst=
ead. He said that realizng god through practices that emphasize the body an=
d its perfection, is nearly impossible in this age due to impurities presen=
t everywhere, in food, water, air and thinking.
> >
> > If one practices ya=
ma, niyama etc and attains perfect composure, then it may be possible to go=
 into samadhi through the control of breathing. But it is unrealistic for m=
ost people. Suppose one has an ocean (samsaara) to cross and a boat (body) =
is given to one. If one is close to the bank (liberation), one can just jum=
p out of the boat and land on the bank. If one in the middle of an ocean ju=
mps out of the boat, one will only sink in the ocean! In jnaana yoga, bhakt=
i yoga or karma yoga, one uses knowledge or faith or ability to work withou=
t expectations as a rudder to steer the boat towards the bank. In raaja yog=
a, one takes control like a raja (king) and just jumps out of the boat. Tha=
t will work if one is close to the bank, i.e. already quite elevated. Other=
wise, just jumping out of the boat is very risky. Raja yoga requires a lot =
of preparation. One in Raja yoga practices needs a good guru to gauge one's=
 progress and prescribe the next steps at every stage. If some things are d=
one too early, it may result in irreversible damage.

 do not be under an impression that you can realize god through such activi=

had faith in Krishna and ended up building a really big organization, thoug=

a, Swami Brahmananda, Swami Shivananda and Swami Premananda with a lot of s=
attwa guna and they kept rajas and tamas at bay. They suffered in the begin=
ning and it took a long time to build, but it will last a long time. Things=
 built with tamas or rajas do not last too long and do not take people to g=
od. One intending to build an organization to fulfil one's dharma should tr=
y to ensure that sattwa drives the activities and not rajas or tamas. Usual=
ly, money brings rajas or even tamas into picture and that is why great mas=
ters have been wary.

ies of a fully realized and liberated soul without any self-identification =
are guided by sattwa. If such a person builds an organization based on sell=

owledge for some reason. Such things are possible but rare. In general, you=
 see great souls like Ramakrishna, Ramana Maharshi and Srila Prabhupada ope=
rating within their means and not charging for spiritual knowledge.
