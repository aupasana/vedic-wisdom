Namaste friends,

I have great respect for Swami Sivananda and commentary o=
n "Yoga 
Vaasishtham" by his disciple Swami Venkatesananda is one of my fav=
orite 
books.

However, I want to put my foot down and record my exception =
to some 
ideas expressed in this series. Swamiji may have been trying to in=
spire 
some sadhakas into the sannyasa order when he wrote this series and =
he 
goes a bit overboard.

*        *        *

> all members of your famil=
y will cling to you like leeches
> till the end of your life

I do not appr=
eciate this tone at all. One can renounce if one wants. 
But, why belittle =
family members and call them leeches?

If one's wife wants to cling to one,=
 because of her conditioning and 
spiritual evolution, it is fine. She is n=
ot necessarily a bad person or 
a "leech". If one engages in dharmik and un=
selfish actions to make one's 
wife happy in various ways, as far as possib=
le, it is not bad and does 
not imply an undesirable attachment. If one *ex=
pects* something from 
wife in return, THAT expectation is bad. THAT expect=
ation of something 
back from wife is a leech that sucks blood from one's s=
oul.

Seeing the world, people and objects as obstructions or temptations o=
r 
"leeches" is silly. Being disgusted with the world is as much an 
attach=
ment (a negative attachment) as is being fascinated with it! World 
and peo=
ple can exist and act in ways that may be natural to them. 
Whatever they d=
o, they are never the problem or blockage for your own 
spiritual evolution=
. You may do various actions and give various things 
to various people, ba=
sed on kaarmik debts, and nothing you do is 
necessarily a bondage. Actions=
 never bind you, it is expectation of 
specific results from those actions =
that binds you. Give freely and 
magnanimously; and take whatever comes bac=
k naturally, with no 
excitement and no regret. Remove ANY expectation that=
 may exist in your 
mind, from ANYONE, and become completely free. THAT is =
true sannyasa or 
renunciation, not seeing people as leeches that cling on =
to you.

If one becomes a sannyasin because one is fed up with the world, i=
t is 
probably a bad idea. When one discharges most of one's duties and 
re=
sponsibilities to others, a sense of genuine renunciation will 
naturally d=
evelop. If one runs away from the world prematurely, Nature 
will drag one =
back later.

*        *        *

When Adi Shankara renounced, his mother w=
as very sad. But Adi Shankara 
did not see her as a leech. In fact, when sh=
e was on deathbed, he came 
all the way back and did her final rites himsel=
f, though that was 
completely against the traditional notions of sannyasa =
dharma. There is 
a big lesson in this.

Actions and paying off your debts =
do not bind you. In fact, inaction and 
pushing off a debt to future MAY bi=
nd you! It is expectation in what you 
do and egoistic attachment to what y=
ou do (feeling proud or ashamed) is 
what binds you.

*        *        *

=
> It is only when you take sannyasa that they will leave
> you free.

Even =
to a sannyasin, many people may cling. They may come for knowledge 
or wisd=
om or to fulfil their pride related to doing good religious work. 
So many =
people clung to Vivekananda and other monastic disciples of 
Ramakrishna. I=
f one expects something back from such followers, 
well-wishers and discipl=
es (e.g. admiration, learning well, spreading 
knowledge or message in the =
world, giving money for the religious order, 
etc), there is no difference =
really between wife and children and them. 
In other words, attachment can =
form and bind you.

What binds you is your attitude towards people and your=
 expectations 
from people and NOT how much people like you and how attache=
d THEY are 
to you. To be free, you do not need people to "leave you free".=
 You can 
be surrounded by thousands of people who are attached to you heav=
ily and 
yet you can be free. Their attachment binds *them*. To be free, ha=
ve no 
attachment and no expectations. Give other whatever your body, mind =
and 
soul allow you to give. Have no expctations of getting anythying back.=
 
Take whatever comes back by itself. Simple!

*        *        *

> When =
you fall sick You will be tempted to go in for their help and 
> vice versa=
.

"Vice versa" is not a problem. Taking care of a sick person if one is 
a=
ble to, whether it is wife or parents or children or someone else, is 
not =
binding. If there is an expectation of a return favor, THEN it is 
binding.=


Regarding taking help: Expecting anything from anyone causes bondage, 
bu=
t taking what comes by itself, with neither excitement nor regret, 
does no=
t cause bondage. Ma Sarada nicely demonstrated this once.

When Swami Yogan=
anda was badly sick, Ma Sarada asked his erstwhile wife 
(before sannyasa!)=
 to come and serve him. That is so unconventional! 
Swami Yogananda protest=
ed saying it will set a bad example. But Swami 
Yogananda did not have any =
expectations and this was done voluntarily by 
his wife (or under the instr=
uction of Ma sarada, but not due to any 
expectations or pressure from Yoga=
nanda). After Yogananda overcame his 
reservations, he was neither excited =
nor regretful. He accepted the 
service equanomously and not worrying about=
 what others will think or 
say.

In fact, if one puts pressure on oneself =
and wants to prove to the world 
how good one's renunciation us, THAT may b=
e an attachment. "Expecting" 
the world to see one's renunciation and appre=
ciate one (or not criticize 
one) is a very subtle attachment. Ma Sarada ma=
y have detected a subtle 
attachment and put Swami Yogananda in a spot inte=
ntionally and made him 
overcome the attachment. Great teachers like Ramakr=
ishna and Ma Sarada 
teach subtle and valuable lessons in a practical way. =
It may not even be 
obvious to onlookers that there was a lesson there! Thi=
s is how sadgurus 
operate..

*        *        *

Being able to renounce w=
ife, children, parents, siblings, house, car etc 
is a great thing. But, if=
 one thinks that those are "all connections and 
ties" that bind one, one i=
s badly mistaken. Those are the gross ones - 
the external ones. The bigges=
t bondage is internal. The identification 
with a body and identification w=
ith a subtle individual identity (e.g. 
the notion that one is Narasimha, a=
n engineer, a scholar, an astrologer 
etc) are much stronger bondages than =
any others.

If one's hands or legs are cut off or if a tiger is eating one=
 alive or 
if one is suffering from a terrible disease, can one focus the m=
ind on 
god and not think of the body and its suffering? If one thinks "*I*=
 am 
suffering" and starts weeping, is one really free?

If someone praises=
 a sannyasin for his renunciation, devotion to god, 
wisdom or spiritual at=
tainment, will no sannyasin feel even a little 
pride? If so, is one really=
 free?

If a sannayasin does sadhana and experiences some special things or=
 gets 
some siddhis, will it not give a little bit of pride or satisfaction=
? If 
so, is one really free?

Focusing so heavily on external renunciation=
 and making external objects 
of attachment seem like a major thing, while =
ignoring the real 
attachment inside one (the sense of "this is I" and "the=
se are mine"), 
is like beating up a tiger cub and feeling proud of the ach=
ievement, 
while ignoring the big tiget just lurking behind one and waiting=
 to 
pounce on one!

*        *        *

Let me say one thing clearly. San=
nyasa or external renunciation is an 
*attempt* to cut oneself off from a f=
ew external objects that cause 
temptation (and bondage!) internally. It is=
 not a guarantee that 
internal temptations and bondages are completely des=
troyed. The real 
bondage comes from the internal attachment and not from t=
he external 
objects. Work hard on removing it. Do not despise the external=
 objects 
or see them as "leeches" or become fed up with them.

Best regard=
s,
Narasimha
