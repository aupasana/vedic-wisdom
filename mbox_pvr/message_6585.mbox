Namaste,

I think what Swami Sivananda said was to make the "Heads in Fores=
t". What 
Narasimha ji is saying is for "Hands in Society". Completeness is=
 "Heads in 
Forest, Hands in Society".

Regards,
Anoop.

N=
amaste,
 
One more small point.
 
> The atman is entirely opposed to action=

 
A knower of atman will tell you that atman is not "opposed" to ANYTHING =
(let 
alone "action") nor conducive to anything. Atman has no likes or disl=
ikes or 
preferences.
 
As I said before, Swami Sivananda was obviously try=
ing to inspire a specific 
group of people for a specific body of work. The=
se words are neither universal 
nor do they reflect his tremendous wisdom I=
 have seen elsewhere in his writings.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

First of all, n=
ote one fact. Long after becoming a sannyasin, Swami Sivananda 
travelled t=
he world, wrote books, gave lectures and founded Divine Life Society, 
amon=
g other "actions"! :-) 

  
*        *        * 
  
If he established DLS w=
ith the expectation that it becomes a success or 10,000 
people join it or =
some such thing, then it would become an ignorant action, i.e. 
action with=
 attachment. If he did the action completely ready for any outcome 
and wit=
hout a sense of ownership, and as an instrument of the divine will, then 
i=
t is neither "worldly" nor binding nor ignorant. The problem is not "action=
s", 
but actions with attachment and a sense of ownership, i.e. actions dri=
ven by the 
will and agenda of a limited ego. 

  
Actions should not be sp=
oken ill of like this. Detached action is a *sacred 
duty* of every being. =
Gods and rishis came back again and again to earth to 
engage in detached a=
ction. 

  
*        *        * 
  
If "the atman is entirely opposed to ac=
tion", then why is atman (Self) even 
allowing action? Why doesn't it simpl=
y halt everything? Or, is all the action 
happening outside of atman? Is th=
ere anything outside of atman at all? 

  
Some buddhist philosophies coine=
d the term anatman (non-Self) to describe 
transient things. But, in Vedic =
philosophy, there is no anatman. All that is is 
atman (Self). Ocean is per=
manent and still, but ripples that arise in it are 
transient and moving. B=
ut ripples are part of ocean only and you do not start 
labeling ripples as=
 "non-ocean". 

  
Atman or Purusha or Shiva is the potential energy of thi=
s cosmos, while Maya or 
Prakriti or Shakti is the kinetic energy of this c=
osmos. Shiva and Shakti are 
seen as different entities by some people, but=
 rishis have declared their 
oneness. Potential energy becomes kinetic ener=
gy and vice versa. 

  
Atman is the still ocean and Maya is the force (kin=
etic) that gives rise to 
moving ripples on the surface. A ripple that exer=
ts itself to move in a 
particular way keeps colliding with the force and k=
eeps moving hither and tither 
in a chaotic way for a very long time. A rip=
ple that does not exert itself and 
moves smoothly as dictated by the force=
 will eventually grind to a halt and 
cease to exist as a ripple on the sur=
face. It then becomes part of the still 
ocean. If a ripple exerts itself t=
o become still, it may even take longer to 
become still. What prolongs a r=
ipple is not movement but resisting the direction 
given by the force and e=
xerting to move in a particular way (or even exerting to 
become still). A =
ripple that surrenders to the force will ride the course and 
die down fast=
er. 

  
Contemplate the imagery I presented above regarding Atman and Maya=
, 
ignorant/egoistic action and detached action! It is very apt. 

  
*    =
    *        * 
  
In not-so-distant past, sannyasins remained in ashrams a=
nd isolated themselves 
from society and did their sadhana. Swami Vivekanan=
da started a new trend. 

  
A sannyasin renounces expectation of things fr=
om people stuck in transient 
material world and does not depend on anyone.=
 But he may still *give* basic 
material things to those hapless people stu=
ck in transient material world! For 
example, Swami Vivekananda and his bro=
ther monks went to places struck by 
plague, floods, droughts, cyclones etc=
 and served people. They provided food, 
medicines etc (instead of lecturin=
g that body is a transient illusion and one 
should stop worrying about its=
 welfare!) and also did construction work. They 
ignored the welfare of the=
ir own bodies, put themselves at risk and overcame 
maya personally. But th=
ey served those still stuck in maya without looking down 
upon them or thei=
r needs or maya that trapped them! Those who wanted food got 
food, those w=
ho wanted medicines got medicines and those who wanted books got 
books. Re=
nunciation means you do not expect anything from anyone and accept 
whateve=
r comes to you naturally. It does not necessarily mean rejecting or 
ignori=
ng others. Overcoming maya does not require belittling maya or belittling 
=
those still stuck in maya. 

  
The trend started by Swami Vivekananda was =
continued by Swami Sivananda. For 
that reason, it is a bit weird to see hi=
m talking so ill of action! He was 
obviously trying to inspire a specific =
group of people for a specific body of 
work. These words are neither unive=
rsal nor do they reflect his tremendous 
wisdom I have seen elsewhere! 

  =

*        *        * 
  
All this intellectual discussion may be satisfying=
 to some, but the quote from 
Swami Brahmanananda in the other mail is very=
 apt: "You have been only hearing 
of all these spiritual things. Now reali=
se them. You have done enough study and 
reasoning. Now do some spiritual p=
ractice. First take up that aspect of God 
which appeals to you most. Follo=
w your own path of Sadhana. When you realise God 
through it, you will feel=
 the joy of realising Him also in other aspects and 
through other paths." =


  
According to Ramakrishna, Swami Brahmananda was a gopala who accompani=
ed Lord 
Krishna in a previous life. His words are simple, pragmatic and po=
werful. 

  
I want this forum to facilitate exchange of Vedic knowledge (a=
nd I will also be 
contributing, though in spurts). But I want more that th=
is forum should inspire 
people to do sadhana and find God. In the end, tha=
t is what matters.
