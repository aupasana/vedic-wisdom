Namaste,
 
You misunderstood me. The appearance was not "before me". It was=
 before my guru Dr Manish Pandit. The only other person present on the temp=
le premises at that time was the gentleman I mentioned, who lost his job af=
ter starting Kaali mantra and went to India for pilgrimage. I was not there=
 then. Though I was chanting with Manish on other days, I was sent away on =
that specific day to visit Kanchi and Tirunavannamalai (Ramana Maharshi's p=
lace).
 
I understand it was Mahaakaali who gave a darshan and asked Manish=
 to spread homam as a spiritual sadhana in the world. She told him that she=
 would arrange all the resources needed and asked him to just start. She al=
so apparently told him of a sequence of events that were to happen.
 
Inter=
estingly, the head priest of that temple had some books on homam gifted to =
Manish and me on the very next day. Neither Manish nor I asked him for such=
 books. We never expressed interest in doing homam or learning homam. He hi=
mself got the inspiration. There was a book on different styles of homam fo=
r Ganesha and another book (by Ramakrishna Mutt, Chennai!) on the procedure=
s for various types of homam. Manish and I were gifted one copy each. I per=
used those books to devise the short method described in the manuals.
 
*  =
      *        *
 
Interestingly, how we met that priest and how this shata=
 Chandi homam was arranged is based on interesting coincidences. The son of=
 the guru of a local priest was visiting greater Boston temporarily. He was=
 a famous sivacharya (a special group of priests) from Chennai and the head=
 priest of Kaalikambal temple in Chennai. We merely went to take his blessi=
ngs on a Thursday night. We chatted a little with him and then my wife aske=
d him "what are you doing on this Saturday". He immediately said with affec=
tion "we are doing on Saturday whatever Mrs Padmaja (my wife's name) tells =
us to do". Please note that we met for the first time in this life and did =
not know each other at all. My wife said "well, we perform a Satya Narayana=
 vratam on every Pournima night. You are most welcome to attend." He said "=
we are coming". Then he called up a few guys in Canada and told them to can=
cel some events in Canada. We learnt later that he was supposed to spend th=
at weekend in Canada. Instead, he decided to stay back and come to our hous=
e.
 
He came to our house on Saturday evening (Pournima) with two other sen=
ior priests. They stayed till the end of Satya Narayana vratam (almost midn=
ight) and enjoyed it. As soon as he entered our house, he declared "I must =
do a Chandi homam at your house. The mother wants me to do a homam here. Bu=
t I have one condition. I and other priests who come with me will not take =
even a cent. You buy the materials needed, but give no money." Even though =
we were not excited about the condition, we said ok.
 
During the navaratri=
s of 2005, a few days after a solar eclipse on my lagna (when Sun, Moon, Me=
rcury and Ketu were in Kanya - my lagna and 8th house from Moon), he came w=
ith 3 other priests and did a Chandi homam in really grand style. It was an=
 amazing experience. It was actually the first time in my life that I heard=
 Chandipath. I had never heard it before. Interestingly, I had my own biase=
s. In the morning, I actually prayed to Mahalakshmi (my ishta devata), "O M=
other, these priests want to do Chandi homam at my house and I consented. I=
 don't know who Chandi is. Whichever deity they call, I will be thinking of=
 you only. You please come and bless us." It was partly innocent and partly=
 foolish.
 
This was my first exposure to Chandipath and the first Chandi h=
omam at my house. To think that I have now done more than 320 Chandi homas =
at my house..
 
*        *        *
 
Manish was concerned about the contin=
ued troubles faced by the Sankaracharya of Kanchi (the state government fil=
ed some cases against him) and he decided that we had to perform a Shata Ch=
andi homam for his relief. He was not sure when and where it should happen.=

 
After the Chandi homam at our house, we became close to that priest and =
kept meeting him regularly (until he left Boston). When I mentioned Manish'=
s wish to him, he said "Sir, we will do the Shata Chandi homam he wanted at=
 our temple. I will arrange everything. You and Manish Pandit just come and=
 sit for the event. We will take the sankalpa you want. I will do everythin=
g."
 
Finally, the shata Chandi homam was conducted March 1-7, 2006. Intere=
stingly, on the 64th day from the poornahuti of that homam, the ruling gove=
rnment of that state was defeated in elections and a new government came.
 =

Manish put it this way later "Narasimha, who are we to help a great saint =
like Sankaracharya? We are not capable of helping him. We are really of no =
use. The idea was not that we would help him. The idea is that we would hel=
p *ourselves* because of the positive intention to help Sanakaracharya! It =
is all Her play. See, the Mother gave the thought of helping him and brough=
t us to Chennai. Then she appeared and instructed to spread homam. Now so m=
any people are doing homam and benefiting. In future, many many more will d=
o. All this is happening because of a positive intention to help Sanakarach=
arya."
 
Though the dates for shata Chandi homam were picked almost arbitra=
rily, there was one interesting coincidence. The day on which the ritual wa=
s started (2006 March 1) was actually the lunar birthday (tithi pravesha) o=
f Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. In fact, the time when we took sankalpam formall=
y and kicked off the 7-day-long ritual (in the morning of March 1) was inte=
restingly within a couple of minutes from the *exact* Tithi Pravesha time (=
time at which the same fraction of same tithi is left as at birth) of Ramak=
rishna Paramahamsa. This was not planned and was a mere coincidence. In fac=
t, I noticed it after the fact!
 
Some forces beyond the scope of the think=
ing of my mind are behind the homam movement that is slowly picking up. I a=
m fortunate to be picked as an instrument in this spiritual movement.
 
*  =
      *        *
 
Actually, I do not honestly consider the goddess and Sar=
ada Mata (and, for that matter, my guru) to be really different. But that i=
s a different thing.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

          Namaste,

          Choosing the r=
ight deity for sadhana is important. If you do not know the 
          righ=
t deity, just doing some sadhana is definitely better than waiting. Pick 
 =
         whatever deity seems natural to you and do sadhana.

          Ple=
ase remember that sadhana for spiritual progress is different from 
       =
   sadhana for specific material benefits. No matter which deity you worshi=
p, 
          sadhana performed for spiritual progress never goes waste. Ho=
wever, 
          sometimes it may be necessary to experience the results o=
f some bad karmas 
          before some good things happen. Imagine all yo=
ur karmas lying in a pile in a 
          basket. Suppose some of the reall=
y good karmas that will enable you to do 
          serious sadhana and exp=
erience great things lie at the bottom or middle of 
          the pile. Wh=
en you start sadhana, suppose god decides to give you the fruits 
         =
 of those auspicious karmas. Imagine him reaching into the pile and 
      =
    retrieving those karmas. In the process, some other karmas may spill ov=
er 
          and give their fruits. Some of those may be undesirable. So w=
hat? They had 
          to be experienced sometime or the other, anyway!

=
          A serious sadhaka should never be disheartened by a few seemingly=
 
          undesirable results after starting a spiritual sadhana. Just ke=
ep going.

          One gentleman I know received mantra for Kaali from a =
very good 
          priest-cum-yogi in late 2005. After he did the mantra =
for a few days, he was 
          laid off and lost his job. He was not per=
turbed. He continued his sadhana 
          and used the break to go on an =
extended trip to India and make a pilgrimage 
          to some nice places=
. He participated in the Shata Chandi homam we conducted 
          at the =
Kaalikambal temple in Chennai in March 2006. He met my guru and got 
      =
    the opportunity to be his room mate for a week when we stayed at the ho=
use 
          of a priest during the homam. He could observe and interact =
with my guru 
          very closely. Most importantly, when my guru had a =
vision of the Mother on 
          2006 March 3 afternoon, in which She tol=
d him to start the work on spreading 
          homam in the world, this ge=
ntleman was present there. Though he could not 
          see the Mother, h=
e actually smelled something out of the world and was 
          baffled. H=
e knew something was going on, but did not know what. The temple 
         =
 was closed at the time and my guru and this gentlemen were the only people=
 
          on the premises when the Mother appeared. Even though he could =
not see the 
          Mother, it was most fortunate of him to be present t=
here at *that* crucial 
          moment. That is enough to mould the rest =
of his life.

          You never know how, when and where the grace of god=
 falls on you. 
          Calculations and logic are useless when it comes =
to the grace of god. Just 
          surrender and keep doing whatever sadh=
ana you picked. If it needs 
          fine-tuning, somebody will appear to=
 tell you that. Any bad things that 
          happen when doing a spiritua=
l sadhana should be viewed as nature settling 
          some debts so that=
 you are prepared to receive the fruits of some really 
          auspiciou=
s karmas.

          As Shirdi Sai Baba says, you should have "sraddha and =
saburi". Have devotion 
          and patience. There is no limit to what y=
ou can get then.

          Best regards,
          Narasimha

<DIV>=
<FONT face=3DArial size=3D2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial siz=
e=3D2>You misunderstood me. The appearance was not 
"before me". It was bef=
ore my guru Dr Manish Pandit. The only other person 
present on the temple =
premises at that time was the gentleman I mentioned, who 
lost his job afte=
r starting Kaali mantra and went to India for pilgrimage. I was 
not there =
then. Though I was chanting with Manish on other days, I was sent away 
on =
that specific day to visit Kanchi and Tirunavannamalai (Ramana Maharshi's 
=
place).</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2> </FONT></DIV>
<=
DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>I understand it was Mahaakaali who gave a d=
arshan 
and asked Manish to spread homam as a spiritual sadhana in the worl=
d. She told 
him that she would arrange all the resources needed and asked =
him to just start. 
She also apparently told him of a sequence of events th=
at were to 
happen.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2> </F=
ONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Interestingly, the head priest =
of that temple had 
some books on homam gifted to Manish and me on the very=
 next day. Neither Manish 
nor I asked him for such books. We never express=
ed interest in doing homam or 
learning homam. He himself got the inspirati=
on. There was a book on different 
styles of homam for Ganesha and another =
book (by Ramakrishna Mutt, Chennai!) on 
the procedures for various types o=
f homam. Manish and I were gifted one copy 
each. I perused those books to =
devise the short method described in the 
manuals.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2> </FONT>=
</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Interestingly, how we met that prie=
st and how this 
shata Chandi homam was arranged is based on interesting co=
incidences. The son of 
the guru of a local priest was visiting greater Bos=
ton temporarily. He was a 
famous sivacharya (a special group of priests) f=
rom Chennai and the head priest 
of Kaalikambal temple in Chennai. We merel=
y went to take his blessings on a 
Thursday night. We chatted a little with=
 him and then my wife asked him "what 
are you doing on this Saturday". He =
immediately said with affection "we are 
doing on Saturday whatever Mrs Pad=
maja (my wife's name) tells us to do". Please 
note that we met for the fir=
st time in this life and did not know each other at 
all. My wife said "wel=
l, we perform a Satya Narayana vratam on every Pournima 
night. You are mos=
t welcome to attend." He said "we are coming". Then he called 
up a few guy=
s in Canada and told them to cancel some events in Canada. We learnt 
later=
 that he was supposed to spend that weekend in Canada. Instead, he decided =

to stay back and come to our house.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial s=
ize=3D2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>He came to our=
 house on Saturday evening (Pournima) 
with two other senior priests. They =
stayed till the end of Satya Narayana vratam 
(almost midnight) and enjoyed=
 it. As soon as he entered our house, he declared 
"I must do a Chandi homa=
m at your house. The mother wants me to do a homam here. 
But I have one co=
ndition. I and other priests who come with me will not take 
even a cent. Y=
ou buy the materials needed, but give no money." Even though we 
were not e=
xcited about the condition, we said ok.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DAria=
l size=3D2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>During the =
navaratris of 2005, a few days after a 
solar eclipse on my lagna (when Sun=
, Moon, Mercury and Ketu were in Kanya - my 
lagna and 8th house from Moon)=
, he came with 3 other priests and did a Chandi 
homam in really grand styl=
e. It was an amazing experience. It was actually the 
first time in my life=
 that I heard Chandipath. I had never heard it before. 
Interestingly, I ha=
d my own biases. In the morning, I actually prayed to 
Mahalakshmi (my isht=
a devata), "O Mother, these priests want to do Chandi homam 
at my house an=
d I consented. I don't know who Chandi is. Whichever deity they 
call, I wi=
ll be thinking of you only. You please come and bless us." It was 
partly i=
nnocent and partly foolish.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>&=
nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>This was my first expos=
ure to Chandipath and the 
first Chandi homam at my house. To think that I =
have now done more than 320 
Chandi homas at my house..</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2> </=
FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Manish was concerned about the=
 continued troubles 
faced by the Sankaracharya of Kanchi (the state govern=
ment filed some cases 
against him) and he decided that we had to perform a=
 Shata Chandi homam for his 
relief. He was not sure when and where it shou=
ld happen.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2> </FONT></DIV=
>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>After the Chandi homam at our house, we =
became 
close to that priest and kept meeting him regularly (until he left =
Boston). When 
I mentioned Manish's wish to him, he said "Sir, we will do t=
he Shata Chandi 
homam he wanted at our temple. I will arrange everything. =
You and Manish Pandit 
just come and sit for the event. We will take the sa=
nkalpa you want. I will do 
everything."</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DAri=
al size=3D2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Finally, t=
he shata Chandi homam was conducted March 
1-7, 2006. Interestingly, on the=
 64th day from the poornahuti of that homam, the 
ruling government of that=
 state was defeated in elections and a new government 
came.</FONT></DIV>
<=
DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial=
 size=3D2>Manish put it this way later "Narasimha, who are we 
to help a gr=
eat saint like Sankaracharya? We are not capable of helping him. We 
are re=
ally of no use. The idea was not that we would help him. The idea is that 
=
we would help *ourselves* because of the positive intention to help 
Sanaka=
racharya! It is all Her play. See, the Mother gave the thought of helping 
=
him and brought us to Chennai. Then she appeared and instructed to spread h=
omam. 
Now so many people are doing homam and benefiting. In future, many m=
any more 
will do. All this is happening because of a positive intention to=
 help 
Sanakaracharya."</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2> =
;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Though the dates for shata =
Chandi homam were picked 
almost arbitrarily, there was one interesting coi=
ncidence. The day on which the 
ritual was started (2006 March 1) was actua=
lly the lunar birthday (tithi 
pravesha) of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. In fac=
t, the time when we took sankalpam 
formally and kicked off the 7-day-long =
ritual (in the morning of March 1) was 
interestingly within a couple of mi=
nutes from the *exact* Tithi Pravesha time 
(time at which the same fractio=
n of same tithi is left as at birth) of 
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. This was =
not planned and was a mere coincidence. In 
fact, I noticed it after the fa=
ct!</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV>=
<FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Some forces beyond the scope of the thinking of=
 my 
mind are behind the homam movement that is slowly picking up. I am for=

          <P>Namaste,<BR><BR>Choosing =
the right deity for sadhana is important. 
          If you do not know the=
 <BR>right deity, just doing some sadhana is 
          definitely better t=
han waiting. Pick <BR>whatever deity seems natural 
          to you and do=
 sadhana.<BR><BR>Please remember that sadhana for 
          spiritual prog=
ress is different from <BR>sadhana for specific material 
          benefit=
s. No matter which deity you worship, <BR>sadhana performed for 
          =
spiritual progress never goes waste. However, <BR>sometimes it may be 
    =
      necessary to experience the results of some bad karmas <BR>before som=
e 
          good things happen. Imagine all your karmas lying in a pile in=
 a 
          <BR>basket. Suppose some of the really good karmas that will =
enable 
          you to do <BR>serious sadhana and experience great things=
 lie at the 
          bottom or middle of <BR>the pile. When you start sad=
hana, suppose god 
          decides to give you the fruits <BR>of those au=
spicious karmas. Imagine 
          him reaching into the pile and <BR>retr=
ieving those karmas. In the 
          process, some other karmas may spill=
 over <BR>and give their fruits. 
          Some of those may be undesirabl=
e. So what? They had <BR>to be 
          experienced sometime or the other=
, anyway!<BR><BR>A serious sadhaka 
          should never be disheartened =
by a few seemingly <BR>undesirable 
          results after starting a spir=
itual sadhana. Just keep 
          going.<BR><BR>One gentleman I know rece=
ived mantra for Kaali from a 
          very good <BR>priest-cum-yogi in la=
te 2005. After he did the mantra 
          for a few days, he was <BR>laid=
 off and lost his job. He was not 
          perturbed. He continued his sa=
dhana <BR>and used the break to go on an 
          extended trip to India =
and make a pilgrimage <BR>to some nice places. 
          He participated i=
n the Shata Chandi homam we conducted <BR>at the 
          Kaalikambal tem=
ple in Chennai in March 2006. He met my guru and got 
          <BR>the opp=
ortunity to be his room mate for a week when we stayed at 
          the ho=
use <BR>of a priest during the homam. He could observe and 
          inter=
act with my guru <BR>very closely. Most importantly, when my guru 
        =
  had a vision of the Mother on <BR>2006 March 3 afternoon, in which She 
 =
         told him to start the work on spreading <BR>homam in the world, th=
is 
          gentleman was present there. Though he could not <BR>see the =
Mother, 
          he actually smelled something out of the world and was <=
BR>baffled. He 
          knew something was going on, but did not know wha=
t. The temple <BR>was 
          closed at the time and my guru and this ge=
ntlemen were the only people 
          <BR>on the premises when the Mother=
 appeared. Even though he could not 
          see the <BR>Mother, it was m=
ost fortunate of him to be present there 
          at *that* crucial <BR>m=
oment. That is enough to mould the rest of his 
          life.<BR><BR>You =
never know how, when and where the grace of god falls 
          on you. <B=
R>Calculations and logic are useless when it comes to the 
          grace =
of god. Just <BR>surrender and keep doing whatever sadhana you 
          p=
icked. If it needs <BR>fine-tuning, somebody will appear to tell you 
     =
     that. Any bad things that <BR>happen when doing a spiritual sadhana 
 =
         should be viewed as nature settling <BR>some debts so that you are=
 
          prepared to receive the fruits of some really <BR>auspicious 
 =
         karmas.<BR><BR>As Shirdi Sai Baba says, you should have "sraddha a=
nd 
          saburi". Have devotion <BR>and patience. There is no limit to=
 what you 
          can get then.<BR><BR>Best regards,<BR>Narasimha<BR>---=

          Leaving astrology aside and those who do not have a guru<BR>&g=

janmashtami we would fast for

          this<BR>> with hte change in festiv=

          changes<BR>><BR>> though everybody knows GOD =

          becomes difficult to get<BR>> out of this<BR>&g=

          thing hangs in the mind<BR>><BR>> One th=

          Suppose if i choose a deity and somethi=

          (materiallistically )<BR>><BR>> w=
hat should i consider that my 
          deity was helping me to clear my<B=
