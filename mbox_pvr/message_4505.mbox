Dear Rajarshiji,
=C2=A0
Elevated status of Usha
=C2=A0
1.Sun ,the illumina=
tor follows the movement of Usha.
=C2=A0
2. Mind growing brilliant is linke=
d to Usha.
=C2=A0
3. Usha is the deity of awakening.
=C2=A0
4.She is the on=
e who awakens and puts the other gods into action and progress.
=C2=A0
5.Sh=
e clarifies and purifies the mind.
=C2=A0
6. Her removal of the veil and br=
inging in light enables man to work, offer sacrifice and reap its benefits.=

=C2=A0
7. Usha of plentitudes is the power of knowledge of conscient truth=
 as prajnana and vijnana.
=C2=A0
8.She observes the divine rule and brings =
in bliss.
=C2=A0
9. She is eternal.
=C2=A0
10. She also stands for immortal=
ity.
=C2=A0
11. She stands for a new revelation of the eternal truth.
=C2=
=A0
12. Men act as a vehicle for her light.
=C2=A0
13. She elevates man to =
the full power of light and pours the divine blessings of immortality and b=
liss oh him.
=C2=A0
14. From her alone Agni gets his soma.
=C2=A0
15. She i=
s the coming of godhead.
=C2=A0
( you must have surely guessed the source)
=
=C2=A0
My point is that it is not Usha alone who has been accorded an eleva=
ted status. This elevated status is not there in the moola veda, or this el=
evated status is not exclusive to any particular deity. It is=C2=A0 the com=
mentator's or interpretor's or upanishadkara's view. For that matter the ga=
yatri mantra also does not have any elevated status in the moola veda. It i=
s later texts such as Debi bhagavatam which accorded the elevated status to=
 gayatri.
=C2=A0
Each one picks up his own favourite deity or concept and s=
tarts glorifying it to the exclusion of all others often misleading people.=

=C2=A0
Look at Brihadaranyakopanishad, similar elevated status is given to=
 the horse sacrificed in asvamedha (Usha vaa asvasya medhyasya sirah ......=
....).
=C2=A0
If you think allegory is the essence of the vedas, please try=
 to explain the allegory of the following mantras for example.
=C2=A0
1." S=
amsrushtam dhanamubhayam samahrutamasmabhyam dhattam varunascha manyuh. Bhi=
yam dadhaana hrudayeshu shatravah parajitaso apa nilayantaam " - from the M=
anyusuktam of Rigveda, ashtaka 8 suktam 39, last mantra
=C2=A0
The literal =
meaning is - Let the gods Varuna=C2=A0 and Manyu together acquire the wealt=
h of our enemies and give to us and instill fear in their hearts so that th=
ey run away.


2. The suktam starting with "Krusnushva paja ........." (T.S=
.1.2.14) used in exorcism and killing of rakshas. Please identify the alleg=
ory.
=C2=A0
3. Atharva veda Kandam 2 suktam 36, Aa no agne... it is a simpl=
e prayer to beget a good husband for the girl. Please identify the allegory=
 in it.
=C2=A0
About parampara (lineage)
=C2=A0
There are many parmparas as=
 you have mentioned and many of them, if not all of them are good.To name a=
 few that of Vasishta, Visvamitra, Angiras, Apastamba, Asvalayana, Kaushita=
ka, Bodhayana, Saiva, Vaishnava, Sakteya, Ganapatya, Srouta, Smartha, Agama=
, Tantrik, Yogic, Sreevidya, Sreekarapatrasvamy, Madhva,Agastya, Lopamudra,=
 Dakhinamurthy, Gautama, Nath, Nityananda, Achyutananda, Ramakrishnaparamah=
amsa, Krishnamurthy, Osho, Sri Sri, Svami Ramdev............
=C2=A0
Please =
clarify which parmapara (LINEAGE) your system of homa belongs to ?
=C2=A0
"=
For that matter, any focused attention given to any work becomes a sadhana =
in it's own rights."
=C2=A0
Computer programming requires great focused att=
ention for hours together. A driver can never take his eyes off the road. D=
riving requires focus. A tailor needs to focus on the point where the needl=
e meets the clothe. Are they all sadhana and do =C2=A0they all lead to real=
ization ?
=C2=A0
Sarvam khalvidam brahma
=C2=A0
"Your above statement stems=
 from an incorrect understanding of what is Advaitha Vada"
=C2=A0
This is w=
hat I have understood of advaita. (excerpts form Avadhoota Gita)
=C2=A0


H=
ow shall I salute the formless Being, indivisible, auspicious and
immutable=
, who fills all this with His Self and also fills the self
with His Self?
=
=C2=A0

Know the Self always to be everywhere, one and unintercepted.
I am =
the meditator and the highest object of meditation.
Why do you divide the I=
ndivisible?
=C2=A0
=C2=A0

The Self certainly does not become pure through =
the practice
of six-limbed yoga.
It certainly is not purified by the destru=
ction of the mind.
It certainly is not made pure by the instructions of the=
 teacher.
It is Itself the Truth.
It is Itself the illumined One
=C2=A0
The=
re is neither knowledge nor ignorance
nor knowledge combined with ignorance=
.
He who has always such knowledge is himself Knowledge.
=C2=A0
There is no=
 need of knowledge, reasoning, time, space,
instruction from a teacher, or =
attainment of Samahdi.
I am naturally the perfect Consciousness, the Real, =
like the sky,
Spontaneous and steady
=C2=A0
The Self, which is Consciousnes=
s Itself,
can never lose consciousness of Its true nature
and therefore Sam=
ahdi is superfluous
=C2=A0
If God pervades all, if God is immovable, full, =
undivided,
then I see no division.
How can He have exterior or interior?
=
=C2=A0
This is my certain perception:
I neither perform nor enjoy past acti=
on, future action,
or present action.
=C2=A0
He attains to the supreme, ete=
rnal Self, in whom exists no Veda, no
initiation, no tonsure, no teacher, n=

figures, no hand-posture or anything =

=C2=A0
He attains to the supreme, eternal Self, in whom is neither
sa=
mbhavi, nor sakti, nor anavi initiation;
neither a sphere, nor an image, no=
r a foot, nor anything else;
neither beginning, nor ending, nor a jar, etc.=

=C2=A0
He attains to the supreme, eternal Self, in whom is no closing of

ostril nor gazing nor posture, and in whom is neither knowledge nor
ignoran=
ce nor any nerve-current.
=C2=A0
Closing, etc.-In the practice of pranayama=
 or breath control,
each nostril in turn is closed with a finer in order to=
 breathe
only with the other nostril.
Gazing-fixing the eyes on a certain p=
oint to induce concentration.
Posture-a particular way of sitting which all=
ows the body to be most
comfortable and yet conduces to the practice of men=

Nerve-current-The reference is to the three nerves menti=

Dear Sindhu ji,
=C2=A0
Thank you fo=
r your response. Mine follows.
=C2=A0
"Mugging up of vedas" - mugging of ve=
das is not like mugging up an engineering text book for the exam. It is a s=
adhana in itself. upto 12-13 hours=C2=A0aday of mantra chanting for 4 to 5 =
years coupled with one's nitya karma like sandhya vandanam, brahma yajnam, =
samidadhanam (the homa performed in the morning and evening by the student)=
. It involves santha, anusantha and avrutis. The sadhana continues until br=
ahma (mantra) becomes his power (varchas) and thereafter for the rest of th=
e life time. I have come across a scholar whose fingers keep moving even in=
 sleep in accordance with the rythm of the mantra. He has transformed himse=
lf into the mantra. The veda is installed inside him. This is no less than =
any sadhana we are speaking about.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
You see, the reason=
 why I mentioned this is again because of a documentary film that was made =
by Sri Staal regarding the Agnicayana he (and his team) had sponsered in Ke=
rala. He showed some "vedic" priests who chant various mantra from the Veda=
s for hours everyday for almost all their lives. When he asked them some pe=
rtinent queries about what these mantras might mean etc, the priests simply=
 shook their head and came up with a very tame reply that this is how they =
have been taught to do things. No wonder Sri Staal came up with the fancy=
=C2=A0birds and bees theory from such inputs. 
=C2=A0
I agree that chanting=
 of the Vedas for hours on end is surely a sadhana. For that matter, any fo=
cused attention given to any work becomes a sadhana in it's own rights. But=
 my point is, to understand the real import of the Vedas, one must do sadha=
na for spiritual realization and then and only then can one really claim to=
 say what is truely Vedic and what is not. Sadhana for God realization is t=
he path, and when the realization dawns in sufficient degrees, one maybe ab=
le to get a really clear perspective of what exactly the Vedas talk about. =
Not with energy flowing through Ida nadi, nor with energy flowing through p=
ingla nadi can one understand what the Vedas truely are. But with energy fl=
owing through the susumna nadi, there is hope! That is experiential and a r=
esult of sadhana aimed at realizing the Self.
=C2=A0
For this transformed b=
eing learning bhashya is not necessary. He knows even beforehand what is th=
ere in the bhashya and what it means in various planes.
=C2=A0
My view is t=
hat, Vedas are absolute uncorruptable knowledge, and therefore before the a=
bove transformation happens, ones understanding of the Vedas and what=C2=A0=
really constitues the ambit of Vedic knowledge will be questionable, if not=
 outright incorrect. Hence, I see no value in statements like such and such=
 ritual is what Vedas is all about and such and such is not. Most people wh=
o make such statements are nowhere close to any states of realization. Mere=
 intellectual assessements are not really of much value.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
If w=
e call Sayana's commentary a distortion, we will have to disown Yaska as we=
ll.
=C2=A0
Well, if you like Sayanacharya' s commentaries, so be it. I do n=
ot consider it sacroscant. So we have to=C2=A0just respectfully disagree wi=
th each other:). Hope that is fine with you. 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
2. "Vasistha sp=
oke the Yoga Vasistham"
=C2=A0
Who is the real author of yoga vasishtam Vas=
ishta or Valmiki ?
=C2=A0
Valmiki notes what Vasistha speaks to Rama.
=C2=
=A0
3. "The vedic rishis were famous for doing elaborate yagyas and homas. =
By extension of your above logic, it means they did not believe in Advaita =
since they used to engage themselves in homas and yagyas?"
=C2=A0
Advaita (=
 or for that matter vedanta) is only one of the six darsanas (or ways of lo=
oking at it). Dvaita, Vishitadvaita and Meemamsa have different views. 
=C2=
=A0
True. Yes there were have been philosophical fights, but that was mostl=
y in the Upanishadic and Pouranik periods and not really in the=C2=A0 origi=
nal Vedic period. Infact, people (indologists)=C2=A0are not even sure of wh=
at constitues the real Vedic age, so getting an accurate description is a f=
ar cry. 
=C2=A0
Sri Ramakrishna and most of his disciples - who were all se=
lf-realized saints - would often comment that from the perspective of a sad=
haka of God, these philosophies were never ment to be in contradiction to o=
ne another but supplementary to each other. They explained in many of their=
 writings how each of them (philosophies)=C2=A0had a place and a stage and =
how each were essentially supportive of the different stages and paths lead=
ing one to the=C2=A0realization of the absolute non-differentiated Brahman.=
 I find this explanation more appealing and realistic.
=C2=A0
I was talking=
 about the ones who composed the Veda mantras. They were all knowing, and a=
ll knowledgebale seers. The Upanishats and various emanating philosophies w=
ithin the ambit of our Sanatana Dharma, all undeniably=C2=A0trace their roo=
ts to the Vedas. That means, the satha darshanas are not outside of the rea=
lm of the core Vedas. Therefore, the ones who composed the vedic hymns were=
 both jyanis, vigyanis as well as performers of elaborate fire rituals, all=
 combined together. There is no conflict here. 
=C2=A0
Just like Vasistha s=
ays in the Yoga Vasistham, God realization is a bird with two wings -right =
action with the right knowledge. Either of the wings not functioning, makes=
 the bird come crashing down. 
=C2=A0

4. "Can you kindly enlighten us, why=
 is Usha accorded an elevated status".
=C2=A0
No surpirse, That is the esse=
nce of veda. Not only usha, amavasya, purnima. kuhu, sinivali, wind, rain, =
cloud, vidyut,earth, fire, storm, water, medha (intellect), pranas,oushadhi=
s, vanaspatis, nakshatras, all are accorded elevated status. That's how ved=
a is.
=C2=A0
Sorry but that is not really an answer at all! It is not at al=
l the essence of the Vedas, unless you belong to the sect of west influence=
d spurious indologists who believe that the vedic hymns were battle cries a=
nd=C2=A0general poetry composed by a group of ravaging barbarians who were =
too awed by the wind and the sun and the dawn and other natural phenomenon.=

=C2=A0
Let me repeat the question I had asked in my previous mail. If this=
 is the essence of the Vedas, can you explain in a logical coherent manner,=
 how exactly does these simple natural phenomenons lead to the elevated Upa=
nishatic philosophies, when every school of thought inside Hinduism traced =
its roots to the core Vedas? How does one explain this so called=C2=A0jump =
without taking an allegorical view of the Vedic hymns? 
=C2=A0
5. "The way =
one can learn is different based on the different models of the aeroplanes =
in which one learns to fly!"
=C2=A0
If one has flying experience on a cessa=
na alone he will not be allowed to fly a boeing. This is why I said I am on=
ly against mixing up.
=C2=A0
One who has learnt flying a cessana can very w=
ell learn to fly a boeing if he so wishes. It can remove his inhibitions ab=
out flying and in future, if God will, can learn others as well. What harm =
therefore in learning to fly, with any model what so ever? None absolutely.=

=C2=A0
6. "No. Many self-realized people have 'mixed' these artifically cr=
eated boundaried and achived and experienced higher states. Anything that l=
eads to God is good."
=C2=A0
They have been lucky. For each succesful one t=
here may be many who have also failed miserably.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0I consider th=
is to be an unfounded fear. Real sadhana for God realization often does not=
 follow such aritificial boundaries. Realization God is never a matter of l=
uck, but a product of intense sadhana and patience. And doing a daily homam=
 of any deity is a=C2=A0furiously beautiful sadhana. Many are already doing=
 it, many more will do in future. 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0If one with all purity and =
best of intentions=C2=A0gives ahutis =C2=A0water on agni instead of ghee, w=
hat will be the outcome ? Intention can not justify flouting of rules. Rule=
s only support and promote intention.
=C2=A0
Rules=C2=A0prohibiting a perso=
n from even trying the ritual is far detremental than making a flawed=C2=A0=
attempt and learning in the course of it. 
=C2=A0
Further=C2=A0more, the ma=
nuals given by Narasimha is definitely not incorrect. Otherwise, so many wo=
uld not have been able to do various homas of=C2=A0different deities=C2=A0f=
or so long on a regular basis and experience=C2=A0things. This is not an em=

Dear Shri.Rajarshi,
=
=C2=A0
1."Thank you for the interesting example above. But I have a very pe=
rtinent question regarding this.=C2=A0 And what exactly does it mean by say=
ing one learned in the Vedas? Can one, who=C2=A0has mugged up the Vedas and=
 a few commentaries of the same, without experiencing any sort of self-real=
ization, be called a "srotriya"? Does such a non-realized being have "fire"=
 in his right hand? Never! "
=C2=A0
"Mugging up of vedas" - mugging of veda=
s is not like mugging up an engineering text book for the exam. It is a sad=
hana in itself. upto 12-13 hours=C2=A0aday of mantra chanting for 4 to 5 ye=
ars coupled with one's nitya karma like sandhya vandanam, brahma yajnam, sa=
midadhanam (the homa performed in the morning and evening by the student). =
It involves santha, anusantha and avrutis. The sadhana continues until brah=
ma (mantra) becomes his power (varchas) and thereafter for the rest of the =
life time. I have come across a scholar whose fingers keep moving even in s=
leep in accordance with the rythm of the mantra. He has transformed himself=
 into the mantra. The veda is installed inside him. This is no less than an=
y sadhana we are speaking about.
=C2=A0
For this transformed being learning=
 bhashya is not necessary. He knows even beforehand what is there in the bh=
ashya and what it means in various planes.
=C2=A0
For information, Sayana's=
 commentaries are based on the nirukta (meaning of vedic terms) of Yaska. N=
irukta is one of the vedangas. If we call Sayana's commentary a distortion,=
 we will have to disown Yaska as well.
=C2=A0
2. "Vasistha spoke the Yoga V=
asistham"
=C2=A0
Who is the real author of yoga vasishtam Vasishta or Valmi=
ki ?
=C2=A0
3. "The vedic rishis were famous for doing elaborate yagyas and=
 homas. By extension of your above logic, it means they did not believe in =
Advaita since they used to engage themselves in homas and yagyas?"
=C2=A0
A=
dvaita ( or for that matter vedanta) is only one of the six darsanas (or wa=
ys of looking at it). Dvaita, Vishitadvaita and Meemamsa have different vie=
ws. By Vedic rishis do you mean the=C2=A0rishis who composed the veda mantr=
as or the later ones also=C2=A0who philosphized on them. The views are not =
homogenous. The advaita vada is the most propagated one among the general p=
ublic and has great appeal . The other views also appear to be equally vali=
d if you read them. There were rishis who subscribed to the advaita vada, a=
nd others who did not.=C2=A0 
=C2=A0
Yajno hi mantaeirdevatamuddi sya dravy=
asya daanam - Yajna is providing dravya to the devata with the mantra. This=
 is another view.
=C2=A0
4. "Can you kindly enlighten us, why is Usha accor=
ded an elevated status".
=C2=A0
No surpirse, That is the essence of veda. N=
ot only usha, amavasya, purnima. kuhu, sinivali, wind, rain, cloud, vidyut,=
earth, fire, storm, water, medha (intellect), pranas,oushadhis, vanaspatis,=
 nakshatras, all are accorded elevated status. That's how veda is.
=C2=A0
5=
. "The way one can learn is different based on the different models of the =
aeroplanes in which one learns to fly!"
=C2=A0
If one has flying experience=
 on a cessana alone he will not be allowed to fly a boeing. This is why I s=
aid I am only against mixing up.
=C2=A0
6. "No. Many self-realized people h=
ave 'mixed' these artifically created boundaried and achived and experience=
d higher states. Anything that leads to God is good."
=C2=A0
They have been=
 lucky. For each succesful one there may be many who have also failed miser=
ably. If one with all purity and best of intentions=C2=A0gives ahutis =C2=
=A0water on agni instead of ghee, what will be the outcome ? Intention can =
not justify flouting of rules. Rules only support and promote intention.
=
=C2=A0
My only contention is that if you are performing a vedic ritual foll=
ow the rules laid down by the rishis and acharyas.
=C2=A0
God bless you.

Namaste Sindhu ji,
=C2=
=A0
Although this mail is addressed to Narasimha, I had a few points to mak=
e since the mail is in the forum.
=C2=A0
and do not violate the fundamental=
 principles of vedic rituals.
=C2=A0
What exactly is the "fundamental princ=
iples" of a vedic ritual? In my little=C2=A0understanding, it is the=C2=A0g=
oal which is=C2=A0God-realization, which is the=C2=A0only=C2=A0"fundamental=
 principle". Anything else is dispensable and therefore not eternal. Vedas,=
 as all self-realized saints have told us, are about eternal truths, nothin=
g short. 
=C2=A0
It will be interesting here to point out that when some se=
ctions of samavedis when they perform sraadham=C2=A0do the=C2=A0hormam on t=
he palm of the bhokta brahmin. It is called panihomam. Even the fire is not=
 present there. It is based on a dictum called " brahmanasya dakshine haste=
 hotavyam" - the homa is to be performed on the right hand of the brahmin. =
It is believed that agni is ever present in the right hand of the srotriya =
(one learned in the veda) brahmin. There is no defect here. It is as per sa=
stra. Now if you modify this and say that homa can be perfromed on the righ=
t glove worn by a brahmin, then the problem arises.
=C2=A0
Thank you for th=
e interesting example above. But I have a very pertinent question regarding=
 this.=C2=A0 And what exactly does it mean by saying one learned in the Ved=
as? Can one, who=C2=A0has mugged up the Vedas and a few commentaries of the=
 same, without experiencing any sort of self-realization, be called a "srot=
riya"? Does such a non-realized being have "fire" in his right hand? Never!=
 
=C2=A0
A real "srotriya" is one who has realized the Aatman, not in words=
, but in the states of samadhi. Such a being "may have" spiritual abilities=
 of fire in his "palm". Anyone else, irrespective of whether he is=C2=A0bor=
n in=C2=A0brhamin family, is merely following a blind tradition without hav=
ing experienced anything and thus violating the essence of the Vedas and me=
rely sticking to external rules which have no spiritual consequence. What u=
se is such=C2=A0a=C2=A0'vedic' rituals, if at all they can be called as ved=
ic. That which is devoide of the essence, is an empty shell which is bound =
to reform or perish in the course of time. 
=C2=A0
Therefore, for me, it ha=
rdly matters if the ritual is done on the bare palms or a gloved hands of a=
 person who has never experienced the Self. Both, are in clear violation of=
 the Vedic essence.
=C2=A0
Homam is a ritualistic form of worship and if yo=
u bring in advaita vada in it it doesn't work.
=C2=A0
This is definitely in=
correct! The vedic rishis were famous for doing elaborate yagyas and homas.=
 By extension of your above logic, it means they did not believe in Advaita=
 since they used to engage themselves in homas and yagyas?=C2=A0 
=C2=A0
Va=
sistha spoke the Yoga Vasistham, which is a pinnacle of advaitha princples,=
 and Ramayana speaks of different yagyas performed by him and Vishwamitra.=
=C2=A0 Does it mean they did not "believe" in advaita? 
=C2=A0
Your above s=
tatement stems from an incorrect understanding of what is Advaitha Vada. As=
 long as one is trapped in duality, merely saying that I believe in Advaith=
a Vada does not make one become so. I can keep believing that I am Bill Gat=
es, but that=C2=A0won't make me Bill Gates. Rather=C2=A0I shall remain mere=
ly as a self deluded entity. Untill one actually experiences the state of n=
on-duality, theoritical talk of "All- is Brahman" is self-delusion. 
=C2=A0=

Adwaith is a state to be achieve. It needs sustained and serious sadhana. =
No wonder the Rishis of yore, who were all self-realized beings - and had e=
xperienced the state of=C2=A0Advaitha - used to perform such long penances,=
 including elaborate fire rituals on a daily basis. 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
It is no=
t a question of whether it is more elaborate or less elaborate or which is =
inferior or which is superior. It is a question of whether it is correct an=
d based on what vedic authority.
=C2=A0
The question is not about being bas=
ed on "which vedic authority" BUT, is the sadhana bearing fruits? Is it tra=
nsforming the individual? Irrespective of which vedic 'authority' says what=
, if a said sadhana is not leading to experiantial knowledge and states, it=
 is useless for a genuine sadhaka. Therefore, the only way to judge is to p=
erform the sadhana and experience for oneself! And this is why there are so=
 many who are already doing the homas on a daily basis. Some have experienc=
ed paritally, some are yet to. And each experience merely rivets one's mind=
 to the sadhana more and more thus plunging in deeper and deeper. A sadhaka=
 has little use for dry theory. That which cannot be experienced, is of no =
consequence. It is this perspective that any sadhana, not just the ones men=
tioned by Narasimha, has to be judged by a genuine sadhaka. 
=C2=A0

2. "Wh=
at I teach is ONE procedure for those who do not know any."
=C2=A0
Are ther=
e different ways you teach a person to fly an aeroplane depending on what h=
e knows and what he does ?
=C2=A0
The flying of the aeroplane is the same. =
The way one can learn is different based on the different models of the aer=
oplanes in which one learns to fly!
=C2=A0
3. "Knowledge of *external ritua=
ls* is relative and can never be absolute. It evolves based on desa-kaala-p=
aatra. There is nothing impure or corrupt about it."
=C2=A0
Rituals do evol=
ve around desa and kaala but if it starts evolving around paatra it is a da=
ngerous trend.
=C2=A0
Paatra is a product of the desa and kaala, not uninfl=
uenced by the other two. That is why these three are used in tandem. 
=C2=
=A0
=C2=A0
4. "The only knowledge that should (and can) be preserved withou=
t corruption is knowledge that is *absolute*. Veda, or the knowledge of imp=
erishable Self, alone is absolute knowledge. Knowledge of *external rituals=
* is relative and can never be absolute".
=C2=A0
Sir, honestly, have you ev=
er read the vedas to know what is inside them ? or for that matter the Saya=
na bhashya. other than in the ritualistic context. I am quoting the above m=
antras because they are commonly known.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
This is the precisely=
 the reason why maybe a Vivekananda had clearly stated that the available i=
nterpretations of the Vedas do not do justice to it's essence. Selective wo=
rds from here and there really do not prove that the Vedas are merely a set=
 of rituals! This kind of an intepretation leads to a fallacy where-in one =
celebrated western commentator on the Vedas believes that the Purusha shukt=
a in an example of human-scarfice practised in the Vedas. I am sure you wil=
l disagree with this. 
=C2=A0
Can you kindly enlighten us, why is Usha acco=
rded an elevated status? Usha is merely a dawn. What is so big deal about a=
n average dawn, so much so that one needs to address hymns to it? Or for th=
at matter other pantheon of Vedic deities from the Rig Vedas, which to the =
cursory reader, gives an impression of mere nature worshipping pagan's atte=
mpting elevated poetry? And if the average word by by word translations or =
a core ritualistic view=C2=A0is all there is to the Vedas, pray enlighten, =
why is there is a gap in the philosophical structure between the so called =
pre-historic vedic hymns vs that of the Upanishadic period? And all the Upa=
nishads seems to claim all philosphical authority from the Vedas itself? Ho=
w can this gap in the understanding of the two contexts be bridged, unless =
one takes an allegorical view of the recordings of=C2=A0 the Vedas, just li=
ke in the case of pre classical Greek orphic-myths and their later day deri=
vatives?
=C2=A0
=C2=A0

Any path, vedic, agamic, yogic, tantrik, aghori,=C2=
=A0if rightly followed exclusively and fully can lead to the desired object=
ive=C2=A0. But mixing up of paths could be disastrous.
=C2=A0
No. Many self=

=
=C2=A0
Thanks for your reply.

=C2=A0
Please clarify whether the homa procedure taught by=

relied upon? Or is it one designed by yourself keeping the convenience fact=
or in mind ?
=C2=A0
There are many procedures even within the vedic system =
for performing homam. Each established procedure given by acharyas=C2=A0 is=
 complete=C2=A0in itself and do not violate the fundamental principles of v=

=C2=A0
It will be interesting here to point out that when som=

=C2=A0

answer within the ambit of vedic knowledge=C2=A0if doubts are raised.
=C2=
=A0
The apprehension is that in the year 2000 you said,

"I cannot po=

=C2=A0
and now you=
 say
=C2=A0
"In my well-considered view, Sanjay ji got some specific secret=

paramparas) from his elders. He then read some books and formed his underst=

parampara secrets". I am afraid he got addicted to the adulation and starte=

e commercial and he started selling manufactured "parampara knowledge".
=C2=
=A0
Yes, his teachings contain fascinating philosophization, which is reall=

an air of "I know more, but will teach later". It is convenient to give the=
 impression that there is more. If anything does not make sense, it could b=

=C2=A0
As he started exploiting and comme=

Namaste,

Thanks for your views. There are many standard homam p=

me more brief. I do not care exactly what procedure one uses and I will be =

any. If you are initiated into a different procedure that you can do daily,=

ners. Suppose the protocol is so complex that one cannot do it everyday and=
 calls one's parents for a lunch once every few months.

Is that better or =
is it better to relax the rules and protocols to make it less formal and se=

The only=
 knowledge that should (and can) be preserved without corruption is knowled=
ge that is *absolute*. Veda, or the knowledge of imperishable Self, alone i=
s absolute knowledge.

Knowledge of *external rituals* is relative and can =
never be absolute. It evolves based on desa-kaala-paatra. There is nothing =
impure or corrupt about it.

At the end of the day, the key is whether one =
is actually doing some sadhana on a regular basis or not, whether it is cau=
sing internal transformation in one or not, and whether it helps in one's s=
piritual progress or not.

* * *

Let me cut & paste a section from a write=
up I wrote for an upcoming occasion. It contains an analogy given earlier a=
nd addresses some relevant issues.

------------ --------- --------
Do Veda=
s Describe External Rituals

Some people believe that Veda describes the sp=
ecifics about various external yagyas. Veda is supposed to be absolute, tim=
eless and uncreated knowledge that is not bound by desa-kaala-paatra. How c=
an descriptions of specific external rituals be unbound by desa-kaala-paatr=
a?

Though Sayanacharya=E2=80=99s celebrated commentary on RigVeda is ritua=
listic in nature, Aurobindo Ghose had a different take in his =E2=80=9CSecr=
et of the Veda=E2=80=9D. His view is that Veda talks about absolute truths =
about the inner self and not relative truths about external matters. Agni o=
r Fire symbolizes the divine Will. That is why it is the immortal in mortal=
s. Its rhythm will devour everything that is perishable and purify all. Whi=
le fire in a fire ritual symbolizes the divine Will, various offerings in i=
t symbolize various aspects of one=E2=80=99s conditioning and the smoke sym=
bolizes one=E2=80=99s passions and desires.

Metaphor: Vedic Homam vs Aagam=
ic Homam

Notions that so and so yagya ritual is sanctioned by Veda and so =
and so aagamic/tantric yagya ritual is not sanctioned by Veda can be put in=
 perspective using a metaphor.

Once there were many people who lived near =
the sea [Aatman]. They regularly sat by the sea and enjoyed the sight and s=
ound of the sea [absorbed in Aatman most of the time]. They described the s=
ea in some nice cryptic poems [Veda].

As people started living a little aw=
ay from the sea [less spiritually evolved], someone had to put together som=
e instructions on how to reach the sea. He said, "keep walking towards east=
" and the instructions grew with time. People faithfully followed the instr=
uctions [rituals].

People started moving further and further inland and st=
arted living in a landlocked desert far away from the sea. This generation =
had never seen a pool of water like a lake, let alone a sea. They faithfull=
y performed the ritual of walking towards east, but did not find sea. They =
debated endlessly whether one had to walk one mile or two miles or three mi=
les and formed different schools of thought. Some walked their chosen dista=
nce, found a tree or a building or some interesting object and even became =
satisfied that that was sea!

Then came some great person, whose instincts =
led him to take a horse instead of walking and ride it for a long distance =
[use of other tools]. He did find the sea after a few months. He put togeth=
er newer instructions to reach the sea, which included riding a horse [new =
=C3=A4gama and tantra].

People performing the old rituals objected to this=
 and said "but then this horse thing is not granted by the book of sea. Thi=
s is a new path and different from the "pure" sea ritual" [pure Vedic ritua=
l]. By now, people did not even understand what the cryptic poems of the or=
iginal "book of sea" mean, but they simply believed that those poems taught=
 the old "pure" sea rituals that they were used to. They were blissfully un=
aware that the original instructions were meant for someone already close t=
o sea and the newer instructions came from someone who actually saw the sea=
 and knew where they currently lived and how to get to the sea from there!
=

Slowly many new sets of instructions involving horses, chariots etc were t=
aught and many new paths to the sea were outlined instead of just instructi=
ng people to walk towards east [evolution of mantra/tantra/ yantras].

One =
particular path through jungles was dangerous [aghora and other dark tantri=
c paths involving practice of sex, meat, wine etc]. Though the distance to =
sea was much shorter through that jungle, it was just too dangerous and onl=
y the bravest and strongest could make it. There were cruel dacoits and wil=
d animals [chance of a fall in a risky ritual] and many weak people travell=
ing to sea via that path were killed. A wise man who knew the entire territ=
ory well came forward, condemned that path and discouraged people from tryi=
ng that path. Since then, even people who were strong enough to successfull=
y make it in that path desisted from it.

As time progressed, people starte=
d fighting too much about whose path was superior. They were foolish, not s=
mart enough to adopt the original instructions, of either the so-called "pu=
re" sea path or the so-called "new" path or other variations, for the chang=
ed geography and changed times. Many followed the instructions blindly, hit=
 roadblocks and did not reach sea. Many did not even know that "reaching th=
e sea" was the actual goal of all their joirneys. They only thought they we=
re supposed to follow the instructions faithfully and there was no need to =
adopt to the changed geographical territory and time. They even condemned t=
hose who actually went to sea, came back and gave updated directions for th=
eir place and time, for violating tradition.

In case the analogy is not cl=
ear, here is a brief summary of its points. Veda is about realizing self. V=
edic deities such as Agni, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Aswins, Brihaspati etc are=
 slightly different aspects of Aatman. Veda describes various aspects of th=
e state of self-realization. That is why it is considered the highest knowl=
edge. Other allied subjects throw some light on possible ways to reach that=
 state. While definitive and absolute statements can be made on the actual =
state of self-realization itself, no definitive statements can be made on h=
ow to reach it. Only relative statements can be made based on desa-kaala-pa=
atra. The path depends on one's current position!

Great men in many spirit=
ual paths, within Hinduism as well as outside of it, came, experienced that=
 state, understood the current state of people around them and gave specifi=
c instructions on how to reach that state from the current state. Some foll=
owed the instructions and experienced the state. Some instead kept arguing =
about the contradictions between paths.

Stop Arguing and Do Sadhana

As th=
e metaphor above illustrates, arguments about various paths are irrelevant =
and distracting. What is important is to pick a path and follow it. Whether=
 one does a Vedic homam or an Aagamic homam is a secondary issue. The prima=
ry issues are whether one does homam or not, how focused one is, how one=E2=
=80=99s focus is improving and how one is being transformed internally.

Ju=
st as a twenty course meal eaten once every six months does not give much e=
nergy to one, a =E2=80=9Cbig=E2=80=9D homam or another ritual done once eve=
ry six months or a year does not boost one=E2=80=99s spiritual or material =
pursuits. Just as a small bowl of rice and lentil soup eaten everyday gives=
 more energy to one, a small 20-30 minute homam done everyday gives a boost=
 to one=E2=80=99s spiritual evolution.

Wise Tradeoffs

Suppose the preside=
nt of the country is visiting one for lunch with 100 associates. One can in=
vite all the 100 associates of the President by name and seat them in the r=
oom individually, following various protocols. Then one can exchange long p=
leasantries with the President and then offer lunch.

Suppose one is in a h=
urry and has very little time. If one still invites all the 100 associates =
by name and seats them in the room individually following the protocol and =
does not have enough time to let the President eat lunch in the end, is it =
a wise tradeoff? Or is it wiser to invite all the 100 associates together a=
nd seat them together by violating the protocol and use that time to let th=
e President eat in peace?

Similarly, is it wise if one exchanges long plea=
santries and gives very little time to eat? Or should one cut short on the =
pleasantries and give more time to eat?

In a fire ritual, making offerings=
 to the main deity is the primary part. Various upacharas done to the deity=
 before the offerings commence is secondary. Various preliminary and final =
steps and offerings to associate deities are tertiary. If one has a few hou=
rs for the fire ritual, one can do everything given in scriptures leisurely=
. If one has only 20-30 minutes, one needs to make wise tradeoffs and maxim=
ize the benefit. It is far better than doing nothing.

Proof of the Pudding

At this time, more than hundred people are doing a ho=
mam to some deity or the other, everyday. Spending time worshipping god in =
fire for 20-30 min (or more) everyday, with an attitude of surrender and wi=
th some basic intellectual understanding of the absolute truths expounded b=
y Veda and Upanishads, can do a world of good to one=E2=80=99s spiritual ev=
olution. The proof of the pudding is in eating it. One can try to perform a=
 short homam everyday for a few months and see for oneself if there is a di=
fference in one=E2=80=99s attitude, focus and clarity of thinking.
