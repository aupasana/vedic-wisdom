Dear narasimhaji

I am facing problem in foucing in one diety.Sometimes I f=
eel more attached to shiva and mediatate on shivalinga
but after sometime t=
hat attraction(towards shivalinga) goes off and may be naturally I got atta=
ched with skanda.
I used to recite shashtikavacham 36 times ..but slowly ag=
ain attention shifts towards someother diety.It goes towards gayathri ,hanu=
man,rama ,Guruvayoorappan ... etc .and so on .



Recently I happend to see=
 a photo of =C2=A0 ramakrishna paramahamsa with kaali in background .I felt=
 attached with that 

diety in photo .There is a forest in backround of tha=
t picture .I started meditating but i would chant ramamantra 


I remmember=
 you advicing to dig deeep rather than digging in=C2=A0 more number of plac=
es .I am totally confused.
Please advice me to get out of this=C2=A0=C2=A0

Yes, it is ideal to surrender and pray to o=
ne deity mainly. However, 
even if you pray to multiple deities, deities ar=

together than us, human beings. So, it is not som=

However, surrendering to (atleast trying to!!) one deity =

approach.

e Sir,

Yes, any of the higher devatas, like Ganapathi, Lakshmi, Saraswati,=
 
Vishnu, Shiva, Durga, Chandi, Rama, Krishna, Narasimha and Hanuman, are 
=
certainly capable of giving anything. However, as they have a huge 
reperto=
ire of things they can give and a nice judgment on what is good 
for you, t=
hey may or may not give you what you asked for right away. 
They may give y=

but all deities have much =
better judgment than you!). Or, they may first 
give you some responsibilit=

you asked for later.

In comparison, lower beings such as Yakshas and Yaksh=

you approach them, you are taking extra responsibility f=

Of course, one can make offerings=

One homam known i=
