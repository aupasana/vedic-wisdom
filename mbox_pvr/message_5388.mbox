Subject: Vaastu homam and worshipping many forms

Namaste,
 
Vaastu purusha is worshipped for specific purposes and is not a genetic deity who could give various kinds of material and spiritual results (like Vishnu, Shiva, Ganapathi, Lakshmi, Chandi, Hanuman etc). Our purpose is to show people a way to reaching god through worshipping different forms in fire.
 
There are some more forms that still need to be added, like Subrahmanya, Lalita, Rama, Narasimha, Grahas, Ayyappa, Saraswati, Hayagriva, Purusha etc. God willing, more manuals will become available later. At this time, several people have found some deity they like and are doing homam as a sadhana. This first batch of people will make some progress and inspire another batch of people in the coming years. We will probably need more options then.
 
Yes, different forms exist because people with different gunas like forms with different gunas. But, getting close to one form requires focus on it. For one's thoughts to be focused on a form most of the times, for one's mind to be reverberating with a mantra most of the times and for one's mind to be filled with a form most of the times, one needs to do sadhana with one form. If one keeps switching from one form to another form, all those forms remain in the periphery of one's mind and none of them takes over the mind.
 
There are many valid paths to climbing a mountain. But, one who keeps going around the mountain enjoying the views offered by different paths to the top, may never reach top. One who instead picks one path and keeps walking may reach the top. Once one reaches the top, one can, of course, see all paths from there and appreciate all paths. An Adi Shankara, as you said, may extoll various deities after reaching god with one form.
 
As Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said in this matter, you need to dig in one place if you want to find water. Digging one meter here, one meter there and one meter elsewhere, is unproductive.
 
If there is a strong desire to worship many forms and if sticking to one form seems binding, perhaps one is not ready for sticking to one form.
 
After all, some people are not born to find water or reach the top of the mountain. They are born to go around the mountain and enjoy various views. That is fine too. But, when we advise, we advise people for the best case.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

> Namaste Narasimha garu, you have provided homam manuals for various deities - I'm wondering if there is any specific reason for not providing a Vaastu homam manual.
>
> Another question: You always mention to start with Ganapati homam and stick with it for quite some time before moving on to the deity that you feel attracted to. You also say to stick with one god/goddess in general. But if we worship the same supreme power in the form of several deities, why can't we perform homams to several deities? For example, I love Mahalakshmi and I perform her homam every so often, but I'd like to utilize Vaikunta Ekadashi that is coming up and perform Vishnu Sahasranama homam that day and god willing perform Kalabhairava homam on Kalabhairava ashtami. I know you never restricted anyone from performing this homam or that and not that I don't freely perform homams to different deities currently.
>
> What I'm saying is, may be the same supreme power likes to be extolled as Vishnu on vaikuntha ekadasi day and as Kalabhairava on kalabhairava ashtami or as Durga during Navratri. Adi Shankara freely praised several gods/goddesses depending on the day or place he happened to be at. If one sees various deities as the projection of the same Supreme Being, one should be able to freely perform any homam especially if one performs them for the love of it and not with any specific desire in mind. I'm not suggesting that I'm "all there" to be completely desire less - there has to be some innate desire behind every action, nevertheless for the sake of argument. Sometimes sticking to one god could also be binding (mentally). Don't we ultimately want to be free of bondage? Please enlighten me on the subject.
