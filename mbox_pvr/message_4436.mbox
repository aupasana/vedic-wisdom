Namaste,
 
Unfortunately, some people relying on Griffith's translation of =
RigVeda are making definitive statements on what Veda says and what Veda do=
es not say and using very strong language to label those who disagree with =
them (e.g. "wolves in sheep=E2=80=99s clothing").
 
I dismissed Griffith's =
commentary in the mail below. Let me use a few verses to illustrate my poin=
t.
 
*        *        *
 
Let us take the first 3 riks dedicated to Sarasw=
ati that appear in RV 1.3:
 
pAvakaAH naH sarasvatI vAjebhirvAjinIvatI| yaG=
YaM vaShTu dhiyAvasuH|| RV 1.3.10
codayitrI sUnR^itAnAM cetantI sumatInAM| =
yaGYaM dadhe sarasvatI|| RV 1.3.11
maho arNo sarasvatI pracetayati ketunA| =
dhiyo vishvA virAjati|| RV 1.3.12
 
*        *        *
 
Griffith's transl=
ation is as follows:
 
1.3.10 Wealthy in spoil, enriched with hymns, may br=
ight Sarsavad desire,
With eager love, our sacrifice.
1.3.11 Inciter of all=
 pleasant songs, inspirer o all gracious thought,
Sarasvati accept our rite=
.
1.3.12 Sarasvati, the mighty flood,- she with be light illuminates,
She b=
rightens every pious thought.
 
To Hindus, Veda is absolute and supreme kno=
wledge. Veda is considered to be the knowledge of the Imperishable Self. Un=
fortunately, absurdly superficial, utterly nonsensical and absolutely usele=
ss translations such as the above reduce Veda to the level of idle and flow=
ery poetry about external rites and rituals. Any student who is genuinely i=
nterested in Veda and the teachings of rishis should reject these superfici=
al works and approach freshly.
 
As I said earlier, Aurobindo Ghose is an a=
bsolutely brilliant intellectual as well as a great yogi/experiencer. His "=
Secret of the Veda" is a very good starting point. Use Swami Dayananda Sara=
swati's commentary as the springboard, use Aurobindo's work as the inspirat=
ion to jump up from the that springboard and keep doing spiritual sadhana w=
hile you study Veda. THAT is possibly the only way to unlock the true meani=
ng and make some sense of Veda. Translation by Griffith is useless.
 
*    =
    *        *
 
Now, let me give my independent translation, inspired by A=
urobindo's work.
 
Sarasvati literally means "the one who faicilitates the =
flow". In Aurobindo's opinion, various deities and external symbols were us=
ed to symbolize various internal principles, *consistently* throughout RigV=
eda by various rishis. According to him, Saraswati symbolizes inspiration f=
rom Truth.
 
In yogic traditions, Ganga and Yamuna rivers symbolize the Ida=
 (Chandra) and Pingala (Surya) nadis and the hidden Sarasvati river symboli=
zes the hidden Sushumna nadi. When Kundalini shakti (power of self-awarenes=
s) flows in Sushumna nadi, one starts to transcend falsified notions of sel=
f (e.g. I am the body) and starts to realize one's true nature. Thus Sushum=
na nadi or Saraswati is the facilitator of the flow of Truth, i.e. awarenes=
s of True Self.
 
My independent translation:
 
1.3.10: The subtle energy c=
hannel that facilitates the flow of an awareness of True Self (sarasvatI), =
by being the controller of the racing horses (vAjinIvatI) of false notions =
of who we are and what Truth is (vAjebhiH) and thus purifies (pAvakAH) us (=
naH). By devotion and surrender to the Supreme (dhiyAvasuH), it illuminates=
 and invigorates (vaShTu) sacrifice of one's false notions about self (yaGY=
aM).
 
When the power of self-awareness is awakened and flows in the Sushum=
na nadi (Saraswati channel), various false notions of who we are (I am the =
body, this is mine etc) that are racing in our consciousness like horses ar=
e controlled and we are purified (i.e. ridden of false notions that make us=
 impure). As we are purified, our devotion and surrender to the Supreme (ak=
a True Self) increases and invigorates the sense of sacrifice in us (i.e. g=
iving up false notions of being and doership).
 
yaGYaM dadhe sarasvatI|| R=
V 1.3.11

1.3.11: The subtle energy channel that facilitates the flow of aw=
areness of True Self (sarasvatI) impels (codayitrI) the bliss of Truth (sUn=
R^itAnAM), awakens (cetantI) good thoughts based on Truth (sumatInAM) and s=
upports (dadhe) sacrifice of false notions about self (yaGYaM).
 
As the ho=
rses of false notions are controlled and one is purified (see 1.3.10), the =
next stage is described here. As the power of self-awareness flows further =
in the Sushumna nadi (Saraswati channel), one experiences the bliss of Trut=
h and good thoughts based in Truth. Thoughts based on false notions (e.g. I=
 am the body, this is mine) may bring happiness sometimes and sadness somet=
imes, but they can never bring the bliss of Truth. As self-awareness flows =
further in Sushumna nadi, one is established in good notions and bliss.
 
d=
hiyo vishvA virAjati||
 
1.3.12: The subtle energy channel that facilitates=
 the flow of awareness of True Self (sarasvatI) illumines and awakens one t=
o (pracetayati) the great ocean of Cosmic Self (maho arNaH) with absolute c=
larity (ketunA) and also throws light on and establishes (virAjati) multipl=
icity of consciousness (dhiyaH) and worlds (vishvAH).
 
This describes the =
next stage after what is described in 1.3.10 and 1.3.11. It describes what =
happens when the power of self-awareness rises the highest in Sushumna nadi=
. One is awakened to the great ocean of Cosmic Self, i.e. one realizes true=
 Self. Also, this Cosmic Self establishes itself as various limited intelle=
cts and objects and as various worlds that exist. One is aware of oneself a=
s the undivided cosmic self and also as various beings and worlds. One sees=
 various beings and worlds in oneself. Such an awareness of Self with absol=
ute clarity results with the power of self-awareness flows totally uninterr=
upted in the Sushumna/Saraswati channel.
 
*        *        *
 
Now, this =
rendering is perfectly tenable. One can defend it quite comfortably with Sa=
nskrit scholars, Vedic scholars, philosophers and yogis. It is a holistic r=
endering, non-silly, quite deep and rich in inner meaning. Moreover, it thr=
ows light on overcoming false notions of Self and realizing true Self and t=
hrows light on the stages of self-realization. Compare this with the superf=
icial meaning given by Griffith!
 
*        *        *
 
Regarding Sayana's=
 commentary and Griffith's commentary, let me quote from Aurobindo:
 
"It i=
s the final and authoritatice binding of the Veda to this lowest of all pos=
sible senses that has been the most unfortunate result of Sayana's commenta=
ry. The dominance of the ritualistic interpretation had already deprived In=
dia of the living use of its greatest Scripture and of the true clue to the=
 entire sense of the Upanishads. Sayana's commentary put a seal of finality=
 on the old misunderstanding which could not be broken for many centuries. =
And its suggestions, when another civilisation discovered and set itself to=
 study the Veda, became in the European mind the parent of fresh errors.
 
=
"Nevertheless, if Sayana's work has been a key turned with double lock on t=
he inner sense of the Veda, it is yet indispensable for opening the antecha=
mbers of Vedic learning. All the vast labour of Europeans erudition has not=
 been able to replace its utility. At every step we are obliged to differ f=
rom it, but at every step we are obliged to use it. It is a necessary sprin=
ging board, or a stair that we have to use for entrance, though we must lea=
ve it behind if we wish to pass forwards into the penetralia."
 
I am amaze=
d that people who rely on Griffith seem to think that they know what is in =
Veda and what is not. Nobody can claim to fully understand what is in Veda,=
 let alone someone who relies on Griffith!
 
*        *        *
 
As I sai=
d earlier, Aurobindo Ghose is an absolutely brilliant intellectual as well =
as a great yogi/experiencer. His "Secret of the Veda" is a very good starti=
ng point for a renaissance in understanding the true sense of Veda. We must=
 jettison commentaries such as Griffith's, if we were to make progress in u=
nderstanding the true sense of Veda.
 
As I said, use Swami Dayananda Saras=
wati's commentary as the springboard. Use Aurobindo's work as the inspirati=
on to jump up from the that springboard. Keep doing spiritual sadhana while=
 you study Veda (to get the "energy" to jump up). THAT is possibly the only=
 way to unlock the true meaning and make some sense of Veda.
