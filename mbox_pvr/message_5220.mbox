Namaste,
 
Purity is not a "0% or 100%" state. It is a continuum. As one be=
comes purer and increases self-control, one may get some results. Thus, a p=
erson still afflicted by undesirable conditioning may acquire enough purity=
 to get some results. But, people like Ravana, Hiranyakashipu etc fell in t=
he end!
 
What I called "purity" can also be called "self-control". Both ar=
e not that different.
 
Surrender of slaves is not the surrender I am talki=
ng about when I talk about surrender to god. The instinct of self-preservat=
ion is another aspect of ego. A person with ego and pride may suppress prid=
e and self-importance out of no choice, for self-preservation. If one later=
 gets a chance to exert one's pride without sacrificing self-preservation, =
one may still do so. This is conditional surrender. In the case of god also=
, surrendering to god when one's life is a mess and one is helpless may sti=
ll be conditional surrender. But, when the surrender is unconditional and o=
ne sees god as the controller of all without any conditions attached, irres=
pective of whether life is good or bad, one becomes purer and purer and one=
's self-control become better and better.
 
A powerless person may also bec=
ome angry. But, as you said, his anger is powerless to do much harm. As one=
's self-control increases, one's tendency to become angry comes down. That =
increases one's power. A person who has a perfect self-control like Shiva i=
s infinitely powerful. From where we are to there, there is a continuum. Hi=
gher the self-control and purity, higher the power.
 
Best regards,
Narasim=

 Thank you for sharing this simple mantras with the readers; literally hund=
reds would benefit from this as they seek their solace. Bhakti is what make=
