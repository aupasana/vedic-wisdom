Namaste,
 
Well, we are not talking about two normal people with individual=
 egos here. The talk of who needs who is irrrelevant and incorrect, when yo=
u talk or Shiva and Shakti.
 
Sun and Sun's shining (through rays) do not e=
xist separately. You cannot separate Sun and Sun's shining and decide which=
 is more important. They exist together. Without his shining (through rays)=
, there is no Sun. Without Sun, there are no rays and there is no shining. =
Sun and his shining exist together and are inseparable.
 
Shiva or non-dual=
 Self is like Sun. Shakti is like the shining of Sun. The rays are like the=
 field of duality. Different rays are like different objects in the field o=
f duality. They may carry different amounts of light and heat and serve dif=
ferent purposes.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
