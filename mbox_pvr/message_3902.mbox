Namaste Nagraj,

Thank you for the nice discussion so far=
.

Serious sadhana defeats all bad tendencies eventually. Sin or no sin, li=
quor is not essential for us. If you have to drink because of friends or so=
me other reason, just say Ram or Shiva naam before, during, and after each =
sip. Apply a sincere restriction on quantity and make no compromises. Event=
ually you'll be intoxicated in sadhana and need no drinks at all whether to=
 socialize or to give excellent performances.

-Kishore

those are some songs on Shiva, Parvati, Rama and
 Krishna. 
=C2=A0
But if I=

to continue someday in the method you/Manishji suggested, like the hundred =

it is good to announce the mantra that I practise, contrary to Sri Vimalana=

Namaste Nagraj garu,

him that hard! If priest was aware and still did that, then I can

and the consequence.

If one goes in the path of a tornado, aware or unawar=
e that a tornado is coming, one will still be consumed by it.

If the quest=
ion is of fairness, well, is it fair that tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricane=
s etc should kill thousands of people every year? Well, Natural order of th=
e universe is neither fair nor unfair. It is just an "order". Your actions =
gets opposite reactions. You experience the fruits of your actions, as dete=
rmined by the order of nature. A person may happen to be doing what he sees=
 as his dharma and earthquake may strike there and kill him. If so, there m=
ust be a previous karma as a result of which he is placed there at that tim=
e.

In the case of the priest in the story, his mistake is that he slapped =
a person worshipping god. If he had no way of assessing the bhava (feeling)=
 in the mind of the person doing the worship, he should've given the benefi=
t of doubt and assumed it was a sincere devotee, rather than assuming it wa=
s a fool.

See, when Ramakrishna went there and saw Trilinga Swami, he imme=
diately knew the stature and remarked that this is Viswanatha himself. Howe=
ver, others may not be so fortunate. You only saw a body with some body par=
ts and some clothes and nothing beyond it. If so, give the benefit of doubt=
 and treat kindly and respectfully. Just because of external parameters, do=
 not judge a person and act harsh.

Hitting a person who still has a limite=
d self-identification is one thing and hitting a person who has no limited =
self-identification and identifies with the entire universe or with a deity=
 is different.

* * *

In any case, do not worry about that priest that muc=
h. For all you know, he may be an associate of Shiva who came along with Tr=
ilinga Swami to enact a story and teach a moral and he may have gone back t=
o Shiva. Even if not, he was lucky to enact an important role in an interes=
ting divine drama.

* * *

Jeevanmuktas may engage in actions that are diff=
icult to comprehend. They have no personal ego, will and agenda. They becom=
e instruments for Nature to fulfil the Natural order. The action of Triling=
a Swami may help several people question, challenge and overcome their bias=
es and learn some important lessons, centuries after he left earth.

* * *
=

Regarding many gods: As I keep emphasizing, yogis and saints sometimes giv=
e advices based on desa-kaala-paatra or advices geared at a specific set of=
 people.

There is nothing wrong in having many deities in pooja room and w=
orshipping all. Such people may lead fruitful dharmik lives. However, Vimal=
ananda may not be concerned about such people. His teachings may be address=
ed at some other people to come in the coming years who he has rina with an=
d who are meant to achieve saayujya of some deities and do some work. There=
 is an intended audience for every work and no work can be perfect for all =
audience.

If the goal is either liberation or a deity's darshan (vision) o=
r saayujya (company), one has to agree that focusing on one deity is the be=
st thing to do, rather than trying to focus mind on ten deities and keep sw=
itching. A deity comes when mind and its thoughts are filled with that deit=
y's name and mantra and other thoughts are driven away from the mind. Vimal=
ananda perhaps wanted to motivate several people to strive for vision/compa=
ny of deities. He probably thought some people he has a rina with would com=
e to earth with such a potential.

* * *

Thyagaraja did compose songs on m=
any deities. But, he first had a darshan of Rama. He spent several years ch=
anting Rama's name and had a darshan. Then he composed songs on many deitie=
s. However, he saw all of them as different emanations from Rama. He saw Ra=
ma in all.

Same with Aadi Shankara, Muththuswamy Deekshitar, Bammera Potha=
na and others.

When one achieves perfection in surrender to one deity, one=
's life is made. After that, one will see the same deity in all deities eve=
n if he worships 100 deities. If one is switching between ten deities befor=
e that, it may not be helpful in filling the mind with thoughts of any of t=
hose deities. Mind sees those deities as different objects and may not full=
y surrender to any of them. Still, as I said, one may lead a fruitful dhaar=
mik life. That's fine.

But, if you really want to taste the nectar of comp=
lete surrender, it is better to pick one deity and fill the mind with his/h=
er thoughts.

> Excellent answers on each thread and mother showed h=

Though I had some spiritual =
experiences fortunately, I am not a realized person. I too am a normal pers=
on with an immature mind. But my guru blessed me that I will be able to giv=
e excellent replies to spiritual questions if I think of him and then write=
