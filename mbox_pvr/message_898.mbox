Exactly.

Some people say "desire of moksha itself is the biggest blockage for moksha" 
and advocate not working hard for moksha. That basic point is very much 
true. But, if that is your only blockage, you are doing quite fine and that 
can be fixed much easier. For most people, there are many more (and severe) 
blockages. Desire of moksha and spiritual progress and performing serious 
and intense sadhana are needed to first remove other blockages!

Best regards,
Narasimha
