Dear Narasimha,
=C2=A0
When the sadhaka effaces his own personality=
 such that the deity of the mantra comes and occupies him, then at that sta=
ge there is 
no real difference between the sadhaka and the Deity(even if t=
he deity is with the sadhaka all day I would say that there is no real diff=
erence).
The difference that one feels is as follows:
One feels a strange c=
oolness on the skin and on the eyes.
A few repititions of the mantra bring =
about a situation where the deity possesses the sadhaka and the sadhaka's p=
rana goes upward very quickly( Urdhwa Retas), 
During all meditation the sa=
dhaka sees the feet or clothes or hands or face, etc of the deity sitting b=
eside him along with minute details of the room (even though the sadhak's e=
yes are closed).
The sadhak typically becomes dreamless except for suchaka =
dreams.
The whole day the sadhaka behaves like a love lorn person. How can =
i again experience the Beloved.
That then is the experience of mantra when =
it is done correctly.
When the sadhak's personality is effaced such that th=
e deity's personality sits there then the sadhak experiences himself as tha=
t Deity(Devata).
There then arises no difference in the sadhak or the deity=
 commanding a certain thing to happen( be it what appears to be good or be =
it that which appears to be bad) . The deity's personality is crucial. Ugra=
 devatas make the person care almost for nothing himself, so self identific=
ation is minimised and the person's spiritual evolution continues.
Remember=
, there is=C2=A0very little=C2=A0according to me which is black magic. It i=
s all a use of Shakti. If your Shakti and deity is a higher shakti such as =
Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your power will be tha=
t of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana). After the death of the body, =
such a sadhaka joins the realm of the deity or if he was originally a Nath =
or a Muni goes to a separate realm reserved for these beings. 
Attacking su=
ch a sadhak brings the full bearing of karma onto the heads of the attacker=
s and some people may realise this to their detriment( Patan comes from Jal=
andhar Nath burying the city of Patan with his Shakti causing an earthquake=
). Some people may even equate this with black magic. Here there is only ac=
tion and reaction.(Bit like you attack a normal person, and you will get a =
result of this from that same Atma whom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes =
later. But if you attack somebody who is identifying with the universe and =
has very few karmas left, then the Universe itself attacks you, because you=
r attack is not on the sadhaka, but on his identification, ie God or the un=
iverse).
If people persist in using the Shakti possesed by a small Pisacha,=
 Bhuta, then there is only a little Shakti which can be used, moreover=C2=
=A0then their minds and intellects will not be free of identification with =
the body and so their actions are those which are generally termed as black=
 magic. These people usually join the same spirits which they have been usi=
ng after death, this is not an enjoyable experience.
Imagine if somebody is=
 worshipping Chandika for a few lifetimes, then even in this birth he or sh=
e is drawn to that deity and such a sadhak may acheive after a few repition=
s of a mantra(because of his previous effort).
On the other hand somebody d=
oing this mantra only in this lifetime may feel that the 64 things which bi=
nd every mantra are crucial and may not acheive in this lifetime.
According=
 to me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let me suggest an easy=
 sadhana.
If one is so inclined, then starting on some good day, do 1000 re=
ititions of the Savitri(some=C2=A0call this the=C2=A0Gayatri, but the real =
Gayatri is hidden) every day, main constraints
Same time every day.
Same pl=
ace.
Same materials.
Same direction.
As little movement as one can.
Count o=
n rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.
Complete restraint on sex(from=
 the mind and the body, not just the body), reduce food intake, grow a bear=
d.
Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels are empty befor=
e you start.
Continue this for 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 times=
.
See the difference in your personality before and after.
Long and short ,=
 what is important is that life may be short, so do some sadhana, and persi=
st with that sadhana for as long as is physically possible.
I hope this cla=
rifies some of the concepts which were being discussed.
=C2=A0

manish
You may post this on the list as a clarification from me i=

=C2=A0
I ment=
ioned the above with respect to the need of thousands of mantras and techni=
calities. If one does not want to command god and wants to be a beggar who =
will take whatever is given, there is no need for thousands of mantras and =
all the umpteen technicalities.=C2=A0These thousands of mantras and umpteen=
 technicalities are for commanding thousands of different results from god.=
 That is why I talked of commanding vs begging. However, this commanding wo=
rks slightly differently than one may imagine. I will elaborate.
=C2=A0
Als=
o, commanding god is NOT black magic. Commanding low level beings is black =
magic, which can be accomplished even by a person not quite elevated spirit=
ually and suffering from a heavy ego. However, commanding higher beings suc=
h as gods is possible only for a spiritually=C2=A0elevated person with no o=
r extremely small ego. This commanding that I am referring to is not an ego=
istic achievement. In fact, an egoist cannot achieve it. Only a person succ=
eeding in completely effacing individual ego can achieve this commanding! I=
 will repeat something from the previous mail to clarify:
=C2=A0

The unive=
rse has many lokas (planes of consciousness), many beings and many objects.=
 There are infinite karmic interactions possible between them. Accordingly,=
 there are infinite possible mantras. When one is able to perfectly control=
 the mind and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but the mantra reve=
rberating in the mind constantly), then one experiences the mantra. This pe=
rfect absorption=C2=A0of self-awareness in the mantra then causes internal =
changes by the flow of energy internally in specific ways (specific to the =
mantra) and that causes corresponding external changes in the universe and =
corresponding karmic interactions between various objects.
=C2=A0
Each set =
of "karmic interactions between various objects" is a "result". Various man=
tras are for various "results". One may term merging self-awareness in a ma=
ntra fully and getting a specific result from it as "commanding a result" f=
rom god. Whether you like the term or not, it is essentially that.
=C2=A0
*=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
But the bottomline is this: Only a highly purified sa=
dhaka of very low ego can command specific results from god (not for selfis=
hness or even ego satisfaction, but acting as an unattached=C2=A0instrument=
 of Nature fulfilling one's dharma set by Nature). Various mantras and tech=
nicalities of mantra shastra taught by rishis are meant for such sadhakas.
=
=C2=A0
Those are hardly of use to so many people out there with dense egos =
seeking specific selfish results. They cannot command specific results from=
 god (because of their heavy attachment to the result, which is in turn due=
 to their own attachment to a limited ego), even if they use all the techni=
ques of mantra shastra and all the associated rules of astrology. Instead o=
f wasting their time with these technicalities, they will be better off lea=
rning to be good beggars at God's door.
=C2=A0
Just pick any prasiddha mant=
ra or a mantra you feel attracted to, without worrying about so many techni=
calities, and learn to be humble and surrender to the Lord. Patiently wait =
for him to give you what you want. Like a beggar, take whatever and wheneve=
r he gives.
=C2=A0
Keep praying every day or every second when you are able=
 to. Even when you are not praying, remember him in all of your actions. Wh=
en you enjoy something in the material world, tell yourself that it is his =
and that=C2=A0he gave it to you. If you remember him all the time, slowly t=
he dirt in your mind will start to get cleaned. This fixing of attitude is =
faaaaaaaaaaaar more important than picking the right mantra, right weekday,=
 right tithi etc (that too based on unreliable knowledge coming from questi=
onable sources!).

=C2=A0
There may be a mountain wi=
th thousands of paths (mantra)=C2=A0for climbing it. Each path may lead to =
a different spot (different experience) on the top and show a different sce=
nery (result). Expert advisors (astrologers) may tell you to use a specific=
 path (mantra) to see a specific scenery (result). But such advice is usele=
ss to a handicapped person without legs (a selfish person with dense ego). =
It is relevant only to person with legs and one who is strong and sturdy, w=
ho can successfully climb the mountain (a reasonably detached person with v=
ery little ego).
=C2=A0
Even when you encounter a person who has legs and c=
an actually climb the mountain, the stress should be on how to climb the mo=
untain and traverse the long path, rather than which path to take. The astr=
ologers who are bogged down by all the technicalities and people who take c=
ustomized mantra advice from astrologers and think that they will get a res=
ult quickly by doing that 'powerful' mantra are missing the basic point. Th=
e power of a powerful mantra is with respect to the experience and result o=
btained *after* one succeeds with the mantra. A partcicularly powerful mant=
ra is akin to a path leading to a point atop the mountain where the view sh=
ows a particularly beautiful scenery. But the bottomline is that you do hav=
e to survive the climb along the long path.
=C2=A0
We need to emphasize the=
 attitude and approach needed for the long climb, rather than emphasizing t=
he choice of the path based on horoscope. It is worth noting that so many g=
reat spiritual teachers who came in the last century or two did not emphasi=
ze picking the right mantra based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasize=
d having the correct attitude - surrender, submission, devotion, patience, =
persistence, discipline, humility etc!!!!=C2=A0*That* is a lot more importa=

You can do an=
yday. Parasara does not mention any day for doing homam to a graha.
=C2=A0
=
In fact, if one wants, one can do a homam or worship to Mars (or any planet=
) every day. It is even better that way.
=C2=A0
If an astrologer suggests d=
oing it on a Tuesday, it is fine. But saying that doing it on so and so day=
 will bring serious dangers because Mars is an enemy of so and so planet wo=

=C2=A0
Para=
sara's definition of gandanta is restricted to two neighboring areas in a c=
ontiguous space having a predominance of fire and water elements. "I see fi=
re and I see water. So there is gandanta" is a wrong approach. One can then=
 call Venus, a watery planet, being in a fiery sign or Mars, a fiery planet=
, being in a watery sign as gandanta. Gandanta requires a *transition* in a=
 contiguous space.
=C2=A0
In your example of upapada lord's tithi, there is=
 no contiguous space where there is a water-fire transition.

Well, Me10, Ve7 etc theory is based on marrying two different teachings=
 of Parasara (bhava karakas and special lagnas). I do not really consider i=

Dear Sanjay,
=C2=A0
> Since you do n=
ot have any real definition of Gandanta, I am dropping that
=C2=A0
I do hav=
e a definition of gandanta, which is Parasara's definition in BPHS.
=C2=A0
=
Since some of you are extrapolating it based on the fire embodied in UL and=
 water embodied in tithis, the onus is on you to outline and justify=C2=A0y=
our definition. I got into this thread because statements were made that fa=
sting on particular weekdays or tithis in a chart can cause "insult to Vish=
nu", "serious doshas" and "danger to spouse", based on these far-fetched ex=
trapolations of gandanta.
=C2=A0
> Which is perfectly in line with everythi=
ng I have learnt.
=C2=A0
Well, you once taught that houses represent Sun/Sh=
iva/truth and arudhas represent Moon/Gouri/perception. That was meaningful.=
 Now, you associated UL, an arudha, with Sun and fire and 12th, a house, wi=
th Gouri and water. I question whether the new theory on fasting is really =
in line with everything you have learnt (and taught).
=C2=A0
BTW, I specifi=
cally asked for a clarification on whether this was based on your own think=
ing or from classics/parampara (see quoted mail below for the full context)=
. Like so many times with similar questions I asked privately and recently =

=C2=A0
Firs=
t of all, Parasara did *not* prescribe fasting on specific weekdays or tith=
is based on any arudhas or houses in a chart.
=C2=A0
For doshas in birth ch=
art or to get relief from planetary afflictions or to get the blessings of =
planets, he suggested various *homas* (fire rituals) and described how to p=
erform them. His section on remedial measures is full of various homas. I a=
m not dismissing those remedies taught by Parasara himself and I am in fact=
 slowly preparing manuals on them so that anybody can do them by themselves=
.
=C2=A0
Parasara did *not* specify the weekday or tithi for most of these =
homas (e.g. planetary homas). Only for homas for specific birth doshas (e.g=
. Amavasya dosha or Moola dosha), he fixed the tithi or nakshatra based on =
the dosha and the deity. But the days are not based on any house or arudha =
in the chart.
=C2=A0
Thus, the principles I am questioning are *not* from P=
arasara.
=C2=A0
Second, I said what I said in a *context*. People are menti=
oning complicated principles that are not found in classics or works of ris=
his and scaring people that performing austerities such as fasting on certa=
in days cause "danger to spouse" or "serious doshas" or "insult to Vishnu",=
 based on horoscope. I find these principles illogical and based on hasty t=
hinking. There may be a little difference between doing an austerity on dif=
ferent days, but my point is that it is smaller compared to the difference =
between doing and not doing at all and that doing it on=C2=A0a "wrong day" =
does not cause danger as being suggested.
=C2=A0
Third, our shastras primar=
ily talk about worshipping various deities on various days, based on the en=
ergy of the *deity*. For worshipping a certain deity, certain tithi or week=
day or nakshatra is better than others. This is based on the deity and irre=

omes out with more money to give to beggars on a specific day, a beggar is =

=C2=A0
I d=
id not say it is "useless". Instead, I suggest that our ability to use it i=
s limited and we should take our limitations into consideration.
=C2=A0
The=
 universe has many lokas (planes of consciousness), many beings and many ob=
jects. There are infinite karmic interactions possible between them. Accord=
ingly, there are infinite possible mantras. When one is able to perfectly c=
ontrol the mind and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but the mantr=
a reverberating in the mind constantly), then one experiences the mantra. T=
his perfect absorption=C2=A0of self-awareness in the mantra then causes int=
ernal changes by the flow of energy internally in specific ways (specific t=
o the mantra) and that causes corresponding external changes in the univers=
e and corresponding karmic interactions between various objects.
=C2=A0
How=
ever, this variety of mantras, experiences and results is irrelevant to one=
 who does not have such perfect control over the mind to absorb the mind fu=
lly in a mantra. It is relevant only to a seer whose self-awareness is quit=
e evolved and hence control over mind impeccable. Such seers are extremely =
extremely rare today. Most people are unable to experience any mantra and m=
antras do not=C2=A0work for them as they are supposed to.
=C2=A0

=A0 *
=C2=A0
Just repeating a combination of sounds does not guarantee anyt=
hing. Some people may think that certain results come when they repeat a ma=
ntra certain number of times. That is an incorrect notion. A mantra may wor=
k for one person quickly and another may spend the whole life chanting it a=
nd nothing may happen. Absorption of the entire mind into a mantra is neede=
d for a mantra to really work and it is much more difficult than one may th=
ink.

=C2=A0
A highly learned scholar in the court of =
a king may be able to command the king and get whatever he wants from king.=
 An incapable one is better off begging the king, rather than trying to com=
mand (and failing for sure).
=C2=A0
Similarly, most people are better off b=
egging god for what they want rather than trying to use the right mantra to=
 command what they want. A beggar does not need a huge vocabulary or great =
scholarship or knowledge. Feeling of humility and helplessness, surrender, =
patience and=C2=A0persistence are what help a beggar succeed. A beggar need=
s the right attitude rather than knowledge. In this age and time, best bet =
for most people is to learn to be a good beggar at god's door.
=C2=A0
What =
people today need for material and spiritual progress through remedial meas=
ures is a better attitude in begging god rather than a better choice of too=
ls such as mantras and other specifics such as weekday, tithi etc to comman=
d a specific result from god.
=C2=A0
It is worth noting that so many great =
spiritual teachers who came in the last century or two did not emphasize pi=
cking the right mantra based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasized hav=
ing the correct attitude - surrender, submission, devotion, patience, persi=
stence, discipline, humility etc.=C2=A0*That* is a lot more important and u=
seful than trying to be oversmart with the choice of mantra, day etc and im=
press god.

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
One more thing. We have many mantra=
s given by rishis, but=C2=A0the guidelines from rishis like Parasara on how=
 to pick a mantra based on the horoscope are very limited. Astrologers toda=
y do not operate solely based on them. They use all kinds of other rules co=
ming from various traditions. They are not free from corruption and imperfe=
ction. Most scriptures associate various mantras with various results, irre=
spective of horoscope. For example, irrespective of who is the 6th lord and=
 8th lord and lord of A6 and A8, Rina Vimochaka Angaraka mantra is good for=
 debt control. And so on. Linking of horoscope is overplayed by today's ast=
rologers, way beyond the scope of Parasara's guidelines.
=C2=A0
If one has =
a sadguru, I recommend following the word of sadguru rather than that of an=
 astrology theoretician.
=C2=A0
If not, there is no foolproof way to know t=
he right path. Pick any path (given by an astrologer or one that you feel a=
ttracted to) instead of wasting time and then keep working on your attitude=
. The latter is the key. As I said earlier, learn to be a humble beggar at =
god's door. Choice of Mantra is secondary and attitude is primary. If you s=
ucceed in being a really humble beggar, you stand a better chance of succes=
s than great scholars.
=C2=A0

Any prasiddha mantra (e.g. ashtakshari, panc=
hakshari, dwadasakshari, navakshari, vishnu sahasranaam, rudram, hare krish=
na maha mantra, chandipath, ganapati atharva seersham, mrityunjaya mantra=
=C2=A0etc) can help one make progress if one develops the right attitude. W=
ithout the right attitude, even an impeaccably picked mantra will do nothin=
g.

Dear Narasimha,
=C2=A0
Since you do not have any real definition =
of Gandanta, I am dropping that and continue with my belief of the junction=
 between Agni and Jala rasi as the case of gandanta and the loka junctions.=
 Which is perfectly in line with everything I have learnt.
=C2=A0
Two state=
ments you have made contradict standard texts on Jyotish and Mantra Shastra=
. Please correct me if I am not understanding you well out here -
=C2=A0
1.=
=C2=A0Statement 1: *fasting on any day or any tithi* is good so long as the=
 sankalpa has been made for the devata you intend to pray to. Results maybe=
 a bit delayed but will be there.
2.=C2=A0Statement 2: *reciting any prayer=
* will give the desired effects for any ailment we wish to remedy
=C2=A0
Is=
 this what you intended to say or did I get this wrong?
=C2=A0
Statement 1 =
is an arrogance that the entire Jyotisha shastra is bogus and has no releva=
nce as the remedial measures prescribed by Parasara and others to be done o=
n specific days are irrlevant and not of much consequence. This sounds like=
 another astrologer I had known some time back whose statements like this c=
oerced me to write Vedic Remedies in Astrology so that people are not misle=
d but such pretexts to knowledge.
=C2=A0
Statement 2 is an arrogance that t=
he entire mantra shastra is useless and the Rishi=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s =
were wasting time in giving so many mantras for the same devata, like say t=
housands of mantras for Vishnu or Hanuman when any one mantra would suffice=
. OR it is like saying that we can take paracetamol and pray that cancer is=
 cured. I think I may have to write a book on Mantra Shastra to validate th=
e teachings of the vedic seers.
=C2=A0
I think there is something wrong in =
the way you are saying what you want to say. Please rethink and correct you=
r statements for the sake of good record in this list.

>>>>>> End quote=C2=

=C2=A0
[Narasimha] We always say that houses (truth) are represen=
ted by Sun (aatman) and arudha padas (maya) by Moon (mind).
=C2=A0
Thus, 12=
th house is the actual creator and UL is the apparent creator in the field =
of maya. Houses (truth) should actually be associated with Sun (aatman) and=
 Shiva (and not Gouri), while arudha padas (perception) should actually be =

 tripod method in dasa judgment.
=C2=A0
Thus, it is actually more logical t=

>> End quote=C2=A0>>>>>>
=C2=A0
[Narasimha] Well, if one cannot fast, then =
one is destined to expend some energy on digestion after all and not focus =
all energy on the mantra. But the bottomline is that shastras say that one =
should meditate either without or with very little food (niraahaaro mitaaha=

=C2=A0
My point is that the examples given have no real=

=C2=A0
One can be creative an=
