Namaste,
 
Your grandmother is correct and her teaching is more applicable in the case of holy homam fire. The priest you mentioned below simply showed poor judgment and understanding.
 
When one blows air into homa kundam directly from mouth, small amounts of one's saliva and one's germs get into homa kundam. That is a very bad idea.
 
When one must absolutely blow air, Vimalananda suggests blowing through hand or some other object, i.e. you blow onto your palm and the air reflects at a slight angle and goes into homa kundam. That is better.
 
*        *        *
 
I never blow air. When fire is getting smaller, I offer ghee, sesame seeds or wood to make it bigger. One need not wait so long that fire is about to extinguish. One should make it bigger earlier.
 
Ideally, there should be fire in a bigger part of homa kundam than smoke. If fire has gone out in a bigger part of the homa kundam and there is smoke and if fire is present in a smaller part of homa kundam, that is inauspicious and ineffective. Lord Vishnu specifically taught that homam should be done with more fire in homa kundam than smoke.
 
Thus, the habit of waiting till fire becomes so small that it comes close to extinguishing, is a bad one to start with. One should maintain a bigger fire always.
 
*        *        *
  
When a sadhaka with a very thin kaarmik pipeline does something, the result is seen very soon. So, if one starts a wrong practice, one will see the result soon and learn one's lesson. When someone with a very deep kaarmik pipeline starts engaging in a wrong practice, the result may be seen much much later. By that time, one may have done that wrong thing too many times.
 
In the old days, priests used to do intense sadhana and burn their karmas. Even if they did something wrong, they would quickly figure it out and correct themselves. Many priests of today have very deep kaarmik pipelines, do not do much sadhana and the Nature's feedback system is broken.
 
*        *        *
 
When a priest or someone respectable does something incorrect, one can speak out if one thinks there is a reasonable chance of benefit from speaking out. Some priests are open-minded and understanding, but some are egoistic and they do not want to be corrected by laymen. If one questions a priest and the priest becomes angry, can one remain calm or will one start to feel guilty or scared? If so, one should not question. One should not do something, unless one is prepared for the consequences.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
