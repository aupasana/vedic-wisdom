Do not think of it in terms of loyalty. Gods are not like egoistic =
people who compete with others and have qualities like possissiveness, jeal=
osy etc. Gods are different aspects of (and pathways to) the Supreme.
 
All=
 gods are slightly different emanations of the supreme cosmic being, who ma=
y also be called "the Self of all". In order to realize Self, one needs to =
reach the supreme cosmic being. That can be done through various gods. Firs=
t develop attachment to one god, appreciate his/her qualities, think of him=
/her all the time and reach him/her. Then you can reach the supreme cosmic =
being through that god.
 
One who is most attached to Vishnu/Lakshmi/Shiva/=
Durga/Ganesha/Surya should look at that god as the supreme god from whom al=
l gods emanate. All other gods are created from that god and rest in that g=
od. It is fine to worship various gods, thinking that they are all differen=
t manifestations of the god one is attached to.
 
If one has not found a go=
d one is attached to and about whom one can think like this, then one may h=
ave to look more.
 
> During navratri is it ok to read devi mahatmyam when =

m benefit?
 
In my personal opinion, it is ok to read mentally. If you do e=
xternal rituals like homam, idol worship etc, however, I suggest not doing =
them during periods and to read mentally instead. This is particularly true=
 for homam. While I do not fully understand the rationale through personal =
experience, I like to respect the words of tradition and of people who know=
 more than me.

Yes. Undivided and full parts are better, but offering s=
omething compatible with the size of your fire and making sure that it burn=
s fully and comfortably is the most important criterion. So feel free to pu=
r chopped things.

Namaste Mitesh,

t should we do, request them to go back to their respective places?
 
The m=
antra used for invocation does not ask for ancestors to enter the water in =
the kalasha. It asks them to come to the area to receive the water offering=
. When they are satisfied with the sesame water, they leave. Explicit sendo=
ff is not done in the tradition I am familiar with. If one feels uncomforta=
ble and wants to send off formally, one can say "OM pitruun yathaasthaanam =
sthaapayaami".
 
> Also is it ok to tarpana in the night say 8 or 9 pm?
 
I=
t is not ideal, but it is better to do sometime than not to do at all.

The verse "n=
arakeshu samasteshu" at the end means: "Whoever are stuck in various hells =
(inauspicious realms of existence in which mind can be stuck after death) a=
nd suffering there, I am offering this water for them, thinking of their re=
lief.". The next 4 verses pray for the relief of relatives, non-relatives a=
nd relatives in previous lives and people born in one's lineage without spo=
use/children and all beings of the universe.
