Namaste,
 
Durga is simply Vishnumaayaa, i.e. the power of Vishnu that possesses the entire Universe and deludes it. For example, you find "vaiShNavIM loka iha maadayantaaM" the end of Durga Sooktam. It says that Durga belongs to Vishnu and She deludes (or intoxicates) things in this universe. (Of course, please do not take the word "delude" in a bad connotation here. If that delusion is absent, there would only be non-dual Brahman and no field of duality and no concept of space/time, no objects, no I, no you at all. This delusion is neither good nor bad. It is just there, that's all.)
 
Also, MahaLakshmi's 108 names contain "navadurgaaM mahaakaaLIM brahmaviShNushivaatmikaaM". "Durga of nine forms" is a name of Mahalakshmi, i.e. nine forms of Durga are Mahalakshmi's different manifestations!
 
The Vaishnava vs Shaiva vs Shaakta schisms are a product of Kali yuga. Do not worry about the distinctions and compartmentalizations that have some basis but are unfortunately amplified in the Kali yuga. For example, Ramakrishna said that Krishna and Kaala are not really different - he said Krishna is like Sun and Kaali is like the sunlight.
 
Bottomline: When you invoke Vishnu or Lakshmi in fire, you can chant prayers of Durga and make offerings too.
 
*        *        *
 
Though letting others make offerings in one's homam fire is a very common practice today, ancient practice was that each person performing homam would have a separate homa kundam and a separate fire. Multiple people could chant mantras and handle/process offerings, but one single person would start the fire and make offerings into it. I very strongly recommend sticking to this rule.
 
Let me say a few words on the reasoning behind this rule.
 
*        *        *
 
The goal of all sadhana (spiritual practices) is "yoga". Though people today think that "yoga" means physical jerks and intricate postures, actually the literal meaning of Yoga is "joining two in oneness".
 
When one engages in bhakti yoga by praying to a deity, one is trying to lose one's self-awareness and become one with a tiny particle at the deity's feet. When one engages in praanaayaamas, bandhas etc of raaja yoga (e.g. hatha yoga), one is trying to merge the praana and apaana vaayus in oneness and merge Kundalini (self-awareness) in the supreme self-consciousness at Sahasrara chakra. When one engages in jnaana yoga, one is trying to find (by the process of elimination) that which is permanent and imperishable and merge one's consciousness in oneness with it (instead of focusing on impermanent and perishable objects such as body).
 
As I said, the goal of all sadhana is some form of oneness or "yoga". That is the same even with homam!
 
*        *        *
 
When one does homam, one is first trying to merge one's bhootaagni (the basic fire controlling one's existence, self-awareness and perception of the universe) with external fire. In the beginning, one may feel that there is just an *external* fire that is not connected to one's self. But, as one does sadhana with fire regularly and forms an attraction for fire, a relationship is slowly formed. In the company of a strong external fire, one's bhootaagni will be aroused and one's bhootaagni will have a union with the external fire oneday. In other words, one feels the external fire to be connected to one's own internal fire of perception.
 
This yoga or association will strengthen one's bhootaagni considerably and make it capable of perceiving various divine beings and divine energies present around one. This will eventually enable one to obtain yoga with different divine energies and beings.
 
*        *        *
 
Suppose a young person is seriously interested in a relationship with an experienced person and shows interest over a period of time. The experienced person may eventually take the young person under the wing and build the relationship. Even if the young person does not know how to do his/her part in the relationship, the experienced one may teach the young one.
 
Similarly, when one tries to create a union between external homam fire and one's internal fire of existence and perception, it does not matter if one's internal fire is small or ineffective. If one persists enough, external fire will guide the internal fire like an experienced partner in a relationship. However, one has to be persistent and one has to be serious.
 
*        *        *
 
[My apologies in advance if this analogy offends some of you.]
 
A lot of young boys may move with a woman and have a friendship. But, in order to have a union with her and get a child through her, one may need to court her and cultivate an intimate relationship. Similarly, to have a union with a homam fire and get subtle perception through it, one may need to cultivate an intimate relationship.
 
 If several people are offering things to fire, it is like a lot of boys moving with a woman. She may not have union with any of them there. If you handle the fire by yourself and do not let others handle the fire, it is like having a personal and intimate relationship with a woman. Just as the woman may have a union with the boy who is pursuing her whenever she wants, external fire may have a union with your internal fire whenever it wants. You just wait. But, one does not make it faster by pursuing many women or going out with the woman with many friends always. Similarly, one does not make it faster by offering in homam fire with many people.
 
Just as a friend who accompanies a boy when he goes out with a woman may misbehave and spoil the boy's chances with the woman, a person who offers to (or otherwise handles) your homam fire can spoil your chances of yoga with fire by having undesirable thoughts.
 
Whenever you start homam fire, imagine it to be your internal fire. Offer in it sincerely. Do not let others offer in your homam fire or handle the fire. They can chant along with you and watch, but not handle the fire.
 
*        *        *
 
Even if you imagine the fire to be an external and do not imagine it to be your internal fire, your internal fire may still be seeking a union with that fire without your knowing it consciously! Thus, it is not a good idea to let others offer in the fire.
 
*        *        *
 
If internal fires of several people are looking for oneness with the same external fire, their karmas will be mixed up and will block each of them from a oneness with it. None will experience "Yoga" with fire and their karmas will be mixed up.
 
Non-dually speaking, external fire in homam kundam 1 and external fire in homa kundam 2 are the same. But, that way,  your internal fire and internal fire in a friend may also be the same. But, at the level of duality, your internal fire and that in a friend are different, carry the weight of different karmas and are conditioned differently. So, they are different and need to seek union with a different external fire.
 
*        *        *
 
Bottomline: Apart from the concern about mixing up karmas, one needs to cultivate the habit of doing homam in a personal homa kundam with a personal fire in order to reach the goal of Yoga with fire (and thereby with a deity) oneday. One allowing others to make offerings in the homam fire may block oneself from that goal. When you do homam, do not start off assuming that you will never achieve god-union with homam. Instead, do everything you can to maximize the chance of it.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

My question to the group is, can I provide the guests as well with some Ghee and Dry nuts to offer in the homa kundam during the pradhaana homam?  Are there any implications in doing so?  Thanks,
