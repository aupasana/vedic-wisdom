Dear Nara=
simha ji,
Namaskar.
I am happy that something *positive* emerged!!!
Thank y=
ou for your guidance,
one other thing I wished to ask you and would you ple=
ase answer if time permits?
One of my friends accidently touched the chair =
I was sitting in and felt a jolt of charge a few days back but I did not at=
tribute it to myself. A couple of days back she casually touched me on the =
shoulder and immediately retracted it saying it was like touching a live wi=
re. Is it also due to the experiencing of the mantra? 
=C2=A0
Sorry to have=
 asked you to interpret personal experiences but I am clueless and highly a=
ppreciative of the enormous *knowledge* of practise of spirituality you hav=
e rather than mere mouthing of wis(e)dom we get to see these days,

Namaste Nalini ji,
=C2=A0
Most people do not experience a mantra. They just=
 mechanically chant it and nothing happens. What you described tells me tha=
t you were able to experience the manta to some extent. That is a good sign=
.
=C2=A0
Though I have never done the mantra you mentioned, from the name, =
I would imagine that this mantra makes energy flow in pingala nadi.
=C2=A0
=
Different mantras, when they work, force energy to flow in different subtle=
 channel of energy flow in our subtle body, resulting in the perception of =
a different "experience" to "self". Some mantras (e.g. tryambakam yajaamahe=
) are extremely cooling and made energy flow in Ida (Chandra) nadi. Some ma=
ntras (e.g. Savitri Gayatri) make it flow in Pingala (Surya) nadi.
=C2=A0
W=
hen merely some vaayu (movement of air) enters a nadi also, there is some e=
xperience. When the entire energy of self-awareness (aka Kundalini) enters =
a nadi, it is a very powerful experience and one's perception of self alter=
s drastically.
=C2=A0
There are thousands of nadis in the body and thousand=
s of possible experiences. The key is to NOT be distracted by the experienc=
e. Mystical experiences are signs of spiritual progress, but they are also =
traps where we can get stuck (i.e. not progress further). Do not think much=
 about the experience. In a normal wakeful experience, our senses perceive =
various objects of the external world. We know that all that is just superf=
icial and the reality within all of them (i.e. Brahman) is imperceptible to=
 senses. Similarly, whatever our inward-directed senses perceive (e.g. visi=
on of a being, sound of a mantra, feeling of heat from fire engulfing one e=
tc) in an intense meditation session is ALSO superficial (though perhaps le=
ss superficial than the objects we see in the external world usually) and t=
he reality within those experiences (i.e. Brahman) is experienced only when=
 you transcend the superficial sense experiences.
=C2=A0
While it is diffic=
ult, the right thing to do when you feel like you described is to ignore it=
 and keep the intense mental focus on the mantra or on the deity. The good =
thing is that your experience is a sign of spiritual progress and the bad t=
hing is that it can distract you from the final goal.
=C2=A0
Feeling hot wh=
ile and *after* meditation and fighting are signs of some diturbation in th=
e pingala nadi. When the corresponding karmas are flushed out of the system=
, things may be fine.
=C2=A0
I am not really knowledgeable. With my guru's =
blessings, I have experienced some things and realized some things. Then he=
 told me to not hold back and boldly declare answers to questions on spirit=
uality and religion as if I just know. I just follow his word and do as he =
said. It is upto my guru and the Mother to impregnate my words with meaning=
 as they are received by people. From my end, I just type out whatever come=
s to my mind...

Narasimha

Dear Nalini
=C2=A0
Sorry for interrupting in your=
 question to Narasimha.Your mail reminded me of a similar incident.=C2=A0I =
have a friend who does very severe japa of a mantra she had recieved in a d=
ream. It was a strange dream where she saw a little girl, naked, come and s=
it on her lap and when she asked teh girl who she (the girl) was, the reply=
 came in sanskrit. Now my friend does not know or even understand Sanskrit,=
 so she could not understand what the girl was saying. Then after some time=
 the girl in the dream kept repeating what sounded like a mantra in her ear=
s.
=C2=A0
>From next day morning my friend started chanting that mantra, aft=
er about one and half years of chanting recently she did a sankalpa for cha=
nting and had experinces similar to the kind u described. She felt her whol=
e body was internally burning, though there was no fever. Her relation with=
 her mom started getting bitter with constant fights etc..
=C2=A0
Later aft=
er some days it reduced again. I think this maybe a way the karmas are cut =
off from you. I am not sure of course, Narasimha can tell you better. He mu=
ch more knowledgeable in=C2=A0 these things.

Dear All,
Namaskar.
=C2=A0
Yes, indeed.
I=C2=A0had a dou=

Devi kavacham. I still have that feeling of an=C2=
=A0aura of fire around me and feel extremely hot and sweat=C2=A0even in the=
 cold weather. This stays on for a time. I also had to face extreme circums=

I=C2=A0vaguely=
 remember Narasimha ji telling us in some forum that there might be some ra=

Could you please clarify, Narasimha garu?

Guys,

I am g=
lad everything is sorted out. But, in general, let us be less 
defensive an=
d instead focus on subject. Knowing Ajit's nature, I knew 
exactly what he =
meant. However, even if Ajit or someone actually said 
something negative a=
bout me, it is not a big deal. One is who one is and 
words, good or bad, d=
o not change that, for better or worse. Why be 
sensitive to words then?

A=
jit, you are certainly qualified in commenting. I always knew that you have=
 
tremendous scholarship, great humility and sincerity. People far less 
qu=
alified than you talk/write so much in today's world. Please do write 
more=
.

The imagery thrown up by the Puranic story mentioned by you is really ni=
ce!

Friends,

Lord Hanuman is one who fully overcame lust. He can be worsh=
ipped for giving 
self-control.

Lord Hrishikesha gives purity and control =
over senses (hrishika + isha =3D 
lord of senses). He can be worshipped for=
 control over senses.

Mother Kaali gives dispassion and kills the root of =
desires. She can be 
worshipped for getting rid of desires.

Several things=
 are possible. But, for most people in today's times, it is 
not going to b=
e one magic bullet that does it, but a combination of various 
practices. P=
atience is needed.

Try to increase the understanding of what is permanent =
and what is 
transient.

Best regards,
Narasimha

<DIV>Dear Nalini</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DA=
rial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>Sorry for interrupting in your quest=
ion to Narasimha.Your mail reminded me of a similar incident. I have a=
 friend who does very severe japa of a mantra she had recieved in a dream. =
It was a strange dream where she saw a little girl, naked, come and sit on =
her lap and when she asked teh girl who she (the girl) was, the reply came =
in sanskrit. Now my friend does not know or even understand Sanskrit, so sh=
e could not understand what the girl was saying. Then after some time the g=
irl in the dream kept repeating what sounded like a mantra in her ears.</DI=
V>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>From next day =
morning my friend started chanting that mantra, after about one and half ye=
ars of chanting recently she did a sankalpa for chanting and had experinces=
 similar to the kind u described. She felt her whole body was internally bu=
rning, though there was no fever. Her relation with her mom started getting=
 bitter with constant fights etc..</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Later after=
 some days it reduced again. I think this maybe a way the karmas are cut of=
f from you. I am not sure of course, Narasimha can tell you better. He much=
 more knowledgeable in  these things.</DIV>

<DIV>Yes, indeed.</DI=

<DIV>I had a doubt that I wanted to ask Narasimha garu. I recited S=
ree Hanumathbadabanala stotram some time back. I had an unusual experience =
of 'being on fire', during the initial stages. It was as if I was engu=
lfed in a ball of fire, which slowly receded over time. I had a similar exp=
erience during the Navaratri puja when reciting</DIV>
<DIV>Devi kavacham. I=
 still have that feeling of an aura of fire around me and feel extreme=
ly hot and sweat even in the cold weather. This stays on for a time. I=
 also had to face extreme circumstances in 'relationships' that matter to m=
e and there is a steady deterioration, almost as if a heavy veil has b=
een torn asunder. </DIV>
<DIV>I vaguely remember Narasimha ji telling =
us in some forum that there might be some ramifications relating to karma t=
hat could manifest when/ after sadhana/worship.</DIV>
<DIV>Could you please=
 clarify, Narasimha garu?</DIV>
