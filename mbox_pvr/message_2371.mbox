Dear Rajarshi,
 
> I hope I have clarified my stand.
 
You did not need to clarify your stand, for it was clear to me from the beginning. Thanks for clarifying anyway.
 
Thanks for the interesting info on the Jagannath temple.
 
It is interesting that you say Thakur's words are like "Gospel" truths to you!
 
Your point on the story-telling style of expression is a good one. Knowledge consisting of mere factual statements is dry and sometimes difficult to digest. Story telling style of expressing knowledge personalizes it and adds the right spices that promote its digestion. Though it makes knowledge easier to relate to, understand and digest, the drawback is that it takes the background and intellectual ability of an intended audience into account and a different kind of audience may misunderstand some details.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

During the days of Swamji, the western scholars unequivocally stated that Puri was build on a Buddhist temple, however today, there is contrary evidences which says that it was not a temple built by destroying or converting another temple. Infact, there are some very old manuscripts that pass on through generations of the main priests of the Temple, which also shed some light on this fact. It is from one of that manuscripts it was found that the Temple was orginally built as a Bhairava Temple with the pradhan deities being Mahakali, Tara and Bhuvaneshwari. The whole area of the temple was designed as a Bhairavi Chakra, that is why the prasad of Puri is called Mahaprasad - beyond all rules (even one who is fasting can have the prasad of Puri).

> To clarify, my mail was not at all a criticism of the man that Swamiji was. Without the slightest iota of doubt, he single handedly achieved what it would have taken a crowd of average calibre men thousands of years. He was a leader of men. And about his spiritual calibre, there is no question either. Thakur had himself certified Swamji, and Thakur's words on spirituality are like Gospel truths for me.

That does not mean Vimalananda was incorrect, not at all, he is essentially correct in all things, but the specifics he would supplement as per teh need of the person he was speaking too. The problem with western style academics is that they are fixated with factual accuracy and do not understand the use of myth/hyperbole/story-telling as a way of passing knowledge (which is so essential in the Indian context). That is why they take every word as either true or false based on strict objective paramters and thus end up making ridiculous theories.
