Namaste,
 
This is a frequently asked question.
 
If someone opening a new bank account has a very rich father who gives him money for the opening balance, one can start off with a million dollar balance. Of course, that helps. But, it is possible to squander that money and end up with a zero balance later.
 
Similarly, one without a rich father may open a bank account with a very small opening balance. But, if one works hard, one may end up very rich.
 
Your question is akin to asking whether a person who does not have a rich father can open a bank account. Of course, he can. He should open an account and work really hard to grow it.
 
Secondly, there are very very few people who have a good amount of shakti with any mantra and the capability to transfer some of it to someone else.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
