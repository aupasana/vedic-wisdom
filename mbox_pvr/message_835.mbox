=A0
To=
 me, the ideal pooja room is a clean and pure heart. Ideal pooja room is=A0=
a heart that has no malice for anyone and no ego/pride. Ideal pooja room is=
 a heart that does not feel proud when others praise one and does not feel =
bad when others abuse one. Ideal pooja room is a heart in which one's favor=
ite deity is established firmly. Ideal pooja room is a heart that is peacef=
ul and views everything and everyone with an equal vision, as a manifestati=
on of one's favorite deity. Ideal pooja pooja room is a heart that does not=
 feel great attraction or great aversion towards anything or anyone. Ideal =
pooja room is a heart that can engage in various kinds of actions without e=
motions normally associated those actions lingering in it.
=A0
The purpose =
of a physical pooja room is to create an ideal pooja room as described abov=
e in one's heart. Exactly which articles and practices in the physical pooj=
a room mould one's thinking to create the ideal pooja room described above =
in one's heart depends on who one is, what one's karmas and rinas are and h=
ow one's mind is conditioned currently. A particular photo of a deity and m=
editation in front of it may cultivate that spirit in one person after enou=
gh time. A particular idol of a deity and bathing of it everyday may cultiv=
ate that spirit in one person after enough time. One should use the article=
s and practices that appeal to one and that are suggested by one's gurus an=
d elders. But the bottomline is that the ideal pooja room exists only in on=
e's heart and one should never forget it. Choicest photos, idols, pooja art=
icles and rituals in the physical pooja room are useless when one's heart i=
s impure. Use a physical pooja room to create the ideal
 pooja room in your=
 heart.

I would lik=
e to quote some portions from the book "Vasishtha's Yoga" by Swami Venkates=
ananda. This is a translation of "Yoga Vaasishtham" . Here Lord Siva teache=
s Maharshi Vasishtha how to worship the supreme lord of the universe.
=A0
"=
It is he indeed who is worshipped by wise men in various ways and in variou=
s forms such as Siva, Vishnu, etc. Now listen to the ways in which he is to=
 be worshipped.
=A0
"First of all, one should abandon the body-idea (the no=
tion that 'I am this body'). Meditation alone is true worship. Hence one sh=
ould constantly worship the Lord of the three worlds by means of meditation=
. How should one contemplate him? He is pure intelligence, he is as radiant=
 as a thousand suns risen together, he is the light that illumines all ligh=
ts, he is the inner light, the limitless space is his throat, the firmament=
 is his feet, the directions are his arms, the worlds are the weapons he be=
ars in his hands, the entire universe is hidden in his heart, the gods are =
hairs on his body, the cosmic potencies are energies in his body, time is h=
is gate-keeper and he has thousands of heads, eyes, ears and arms. He touch=
es all, tastes all, he hears all, he thinks through all though he is beyond=
 thiniking. He does everything at all times, he bestows whatever one thinks=
 of or desires, he dwells in all, he is the all, he alone is to be sought b=
y all. Thus
 should one contemplate him.
=A0
"The Lord is not to be worship=
ped by material substances but by one's own consciousness. Not be waving of=
 lamps nor lighting incense, nor by offering flowers nor even by offering f=
ood or sandalpaste. He is worshipped by self-realisation alone. This is the=
 supreme meditation, this is the supreme worship: the continuous and unbrok=
en awareness of the indwelling presence, inner light or consciousness. Whil=
e doing whatever one is doing - seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating=
, moving, sleeping, breathing or talking - one should realize one's essenti=
al nature as pure consciousness.
=A0
"One should contemplate that the Lord =
is the intelligence in the body. The various functions and faculties in the=
 body serve that intelligence as consorts serve their lord. The mind is the=
 messenger who brings and presents to the Lord the knowledge of the three w=
orlds. The two fundamental energies, viz., the energy of wisdom (jnaana sak=
ti) and the energy of action (kriyaa sakti), are the consorts of the Lord. =
Diverse aspects of knowledge are his ornaments.=A0 The organs of action are=
 the gates through which the Lord enters the outside world.
=A0
"He who con=
templates in this manner is equanimity itself, his behavior is equanimous, =
guided by equal vision. He has reached the state of natural goodness and in=
ner purity and he is beautiful in every aspect of his being. He worships th=
e Lord who is the intelligence that pervades his entire body.
=A0
" The wor=
ship is performed day and night perpetually, with the objects that are effo=
rtlessly obtained, and are offered to the Lord with a mind firmless establi=
shed in equanimity and in the right spirit. The Lord should be worshipped w=
ith everything that is obtained without effort. One should never make the l=
east effort to obtain that which one does not possess. The Lord should be w=
orshipped by means of all the enjoyments that the body enjoys, through eati=
ng, drinking, being with one's consort and such other pleasures. The Lord s=
hould be worshipped with the illnesses one experiences and with every sort =
of unhappiness or suffering one experiences. The=A0Lord should be worshippe=
d with all of one's activities, including life and death and all of one's d=
reams. The=A0Lord should be worshipped with one's poverty and prosperity. T=
he Lord should be worshipped even with fights and quarrels as well as woth =
sports and other passtimes, and with manifestation of
 emotions of attracti=
on and aversion. The Lord should be adored with the noble qualities of a pi=
ous heart - friendship, compassion, joy and indifference.
=A0
"The Lord sho=
uld be worshipped with all kinds of pleasures that are granted to one unsou=
ght, whether those pleasures are sanctioned by the scriptures, etc., or for=
bidden by them. The Lord should be worshipped with those which are regarded=
 as desirable and others which are regarded as undesirable, with those that=
 are considered appropriate and others that are considered inappropriate. F=
or this worship, one should abandon what is lost and one should accept and =
