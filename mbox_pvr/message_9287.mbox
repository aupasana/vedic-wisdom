=C2=A0
There may be some =
confusion regarding "poornavatara".
=C2=A0
As Parasara used it, the term "p=
oornavatara" does NOT mean "the most complete or perfect avatara". It means=
 a completely divine avatara with no jivamsa. There can be more than one po=
ornavataras. They are not necessarily "equal".
=C2=A0
To give a simplisitc =
analogy, some jewllery may be gold mixed with some amount of copper. If one=
 jewllery is 100% pure gold, it does not mean it contains all the gold in t=
he world. It only means it has nothing other than gold. Similarly, the four=
 poornavataras mentioned by Parasara are 100% divine and do not contain jiv=
amsa. It does not mean they contain "all the divinity" in cosmos.
=C2=A0

=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
In fact, the very notion that any one form can be "th=
e most complete or perfect avatara" or "one that personifies entire divinit=
y of Supreme Being" or "one equal to Supreme Being" is unacceptable and inc=
onsistent with SB 1.3.30-31, which says that ANY form of Supreme Being is l=
ike a cloud in the sky, while Supreme Being is like the sky containing all =
possible clouds.
=C2=A0
Supreme Being is endowed with infinite qualities. A=
ny form contains a finite number of those qualities. So no form can be "equ=
al to" Supreme Being. SB 1.3.30-31 is clear in that regard.
=C2=A0
If one f=
orm is "equal to" supreme being and others are not, you can conclude that t=
hat form is "the best". If neither form is "equal to" supreme being, how ca=
n you really compare the different qualities of two forms?

Anyway, this renders your (3) a meaningless issue. Whether =
that line refers to Krishna alone or not is irrelevant, for, in either case=
, "swayam bhagavan" cannot mean "a personification of the entirety of supre=
me being". Before you wonder whether it refers to Krishna alone or not, fir=
st figure out what "swayam bhagavan" actually means, in a way that is not i=
nconsistent with verses that follow! If no form is "equal to" supreme being=
 and every form is a "subset" of supreme being (like a cloud in sky), what =
is the meaning of "swayam bhagavan"???

Regard=
ing (4), Parasara identified 4 avataras as 100% divine, with no jivamsa, an=
d identified the source of divinity in each of them. He only gave objective=
 information and did not give any subjective judgment on who is the best, w=
hich Suta apparently did.
=C2=A0
I have not read BV Purana. If you can quot=
e some verses before and after, I can comment. Any comparison between avata=
ras WILL have to be under some subjective context. I don't know the context=
 of Suta's statement you allude to.
=C2=A0
Though any comparison is subject=
ive, I will be surprised if someone considers the other two poornavataras o=
f Vishnu as the "best" avataras. But, I will not be surprised if different =
people consider Rama and Krishna as the most perfect avataras. Sun and Moon=
 are the luminaries and show soul and mind, which clearly have a primary si=
gnificance compared to other aspects of consciousness! So Rama and Krishna =
are bound to be seen as the best by different people. However, what Suta ap=
parently said can only be a subjective view under some context.

Regarding (2): Kala means a part or a phase. Moon has 16=
 phases (representing 16 tithis, including Amavasya and Pournima), but Sun =
has only one phase - he is always full and bright!
=C2=A0
Just like Moon, m=
ind has many moods, even a perfected one. A perfected mind goes through tho=
se moods with full awareness of underlying reality, whereas an imperfect mi=
nd experiences them under delusion. But it is the nature of Moon/mind to ha=
ve variations. Sun/soul OTOH has no such variations.
=C2=A0
Krishna may sho=
w Vishwaroopa oneday, run away from battlefield another day (e.g. Jarasandh=
a), do amazing miracles oneday and play clever tricks another day. There is=
 a lot more variety to his personality than Rama's. Now, does that make him=
 better or worse than Rama? Well, that is a *subjective* matter.

Regarding (1): Parasara said that paramatmamsa is pre=
sent in several beings such a planets, Brahma, Shiva, their consorts, etc. =
Grahas sustain the world appearance in consciousness by grasping it based o=
n karmaphala. So they stand for different qualities of Vishnu that sustain =
the world appearance. So Vishnu's avataras are associated with grahas. But =
Pararsara said that avataras can descend from the paramatmamsa present in s=
everal other beings (e.g. Shiva, Parvati, Ashwins, Maruts etc). Unfortunate=
ly, we have meagre understanding what various deities stand for, what force=
s play a role in creating, sustaining and destroying the world appearance i=
n consciousness. People talk too much about Vedanta (end of Veda) and there=
 is hardly any understanding of Veda. When it comes to Puranic stories, we =
think in terms of superficial stories and not in terms of how it maps to wh=
at happens in consciousness.
=C2=A0
Mohini was an avatara of Vishnu + Mahes=
hwari. Nara & Narayana were incarnations of Narayana (i.e. Brahma + Vishnu =
+ Shiva). I don't know about Dhanvantari and will pass for today. Dattatrey=
a again was an incarnation of Shiva + Vishnu + Brahma. Balarama is an incar=
nation of great serpent Adi Sesha (like Lakshmana).
=C2=A0
We need to go de=
eper into what they all stand for esoterically and what role they play in t=
he functioning of consciousness, to understand this more. Hopefully another=
 day..

Adwaitins who are skeptical about noti=
ons taught by Parasara (paramatmamsa, jivatmamsa, different sources of para=
mtmamsa etc) should realize one thing. Though all is Brahman, all did not c=
ome from Brahman in one step. It all evolved in many steps and correspondin=

If a characte=

ly merge back into my mind and not into Brahman yet. Of course, it cannot d=
o even that until I actually will it. It is after all a character created a=
nd sustained in my mind!
=C2=A0
Same thing applies to us!
=C2=A0
Vedanta is=
 not wrong. But it is relevant and applicable at "anta", i.e. the end. Most=
 of us may not yet be anywhere near "the end".

BTW, I distinguished between Vishnu and 
Narayana above. If you study N=
arayana sooktam and Vishnu Sooktam, you 
can understand the difference. In =
Vaishnava traditions, they are 
considered one, but, strictly speaking, tha=
t is inaccurate. Of course, 
you can reach Narayana through Vishnu. But the=
n, you can reach Narayana 
through Rudra or Bhairava as well!

The *world*? You mean the world of Rajarshi? ;-)
=C2=A0
Worl=
d accepts 10 avataras where Kalki will be the 10th (and not 9th as you sugg=
ested, to fit your notion of evolution). Even those who are uncomfortable w=
ith Buddha replace him with someone else rather than make it 9 avataras. Wo=

First of all, dasavataras are not a "top 10" short-list of SB's list. SB li=
st gives the avataras of Supreme Being ("Purusha" as it calls). Dasavataras=
 OTOH are specifically of Vishnu, who is the "sustaining principle" of Puru=
sha. Dattatreya is an avatara of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva together, i.e. cr=
eative, sustaining and destructive principles of Purusha combined together.=

>>>=C2=A0
>>>Firstly, I feel, the co=
nception of colloquially used=C2=A0term=C2=A0Bhagawan as a Superman with un=
limited potentials way beyond what any normal human being can achieve, came=
 into existence from the Vaishnava schools of Kali Yuga, who looked at Krsh=
na as the ultimate God=C2=A0on earth. It is difficult to miss the phonetic=
=C2=A0similarity between terms Bhagawata and Bhagawana. The Bhagawata relig=
ion started from the Gita and a contemplation of the life of Krshna. All th=
e major purely=C2=A0Vaishnava Acharyas - Ramanujacharya, Madhavacharya, Val=
lavacharya, Nimbarka, Sri Chaitanya=C2=A0as well as the nava-naths (Dhanesh=
wari was the earliest known non-sanskrit translation of the Gita) - conside=
red, (with differing nuances on the=C2=A0relation between jiva, paramatma, =
moksha=C2=A0etc), Krshna as the ultimate conception of God on earth. This w=
as aided in no less a measure by the delcaration of the earliest Puranas, t=
hat is Vishnu Purana and the SB, that Krshna was a complete Avatara. Some,
=
 like the Gaudiya Vaishnavas, went one step ahead and took a very literal v=
iew of it all and declared Krshna as the Ultimate Being, and the formless P=
aramatma, as well as Narayana,=C2=A0as merely=C2=A0the aura of Krshna. Rama=
 was also intricately linked to this Krshnaa-ism, but was looked at as the =
earlier brith of Krshna, not as a separate Divity in himself.
>>>=C2=A0
>>>=
Whatever the case maybe, each school had its own set of established saints =
and scholars to vouch for their views. So it boiled down to interpretation,=
 which is often, as you rightly pointed out, based on=C2=A0various conditio=
nings.
>>>=C2=A0
>>>We=C2=A0human beings are creatures of imagination. When=

s until the next Avatara comes on earth. I am sure in the period after Rama=
, and before Krshna, of which we have very little written record, the world=
 at large remained entirely overawed by Rama Avatara.

 the Avatara to the general masses - who will then create new scriptures an=

with perfect detachement from eveyrthing of this plane. Neither false prais=
es, nor wrong accusations by his close people can affect him one bit. And I=

 by point manner.
>>>>>
>>>>>
>>>>>1. In the Bhagwata Purana, there are a l=
ist of 22 Avataras of Vishnu. In this list of 22, Varaha Avatara is the 2nd=
 Avatara, and Matsya is the 10th Avatara. Dattatreya, Nara-narayana,Vyasa D=
eva himself are in this list, and then the Bhagawata Purana goes ontu menti=
on that the Avatars of Vishnu are innumerable. In the 10th Canto, Vyasa say=
s all these Avatars, and innumerable others, are amsas of the Supreme Being=
 while Krshna is "swayam Bhagawan."
>>>>>
>>>>>
>>>>>2. Of these various po=
ssible Avataras, 10, or rather 9 as I believe, are/have been accorded speci=
al mention and significance across various Hindu spiritual literature, spec=
ially those which were composed in the Kali-Yuga, namely the Puranas.[When =
Krshna was alive, it was Kali-Sandhya, his physical presence had curtailed =
the full effect of Kali,once he left his body, Kali started in full flow. A=
ll Puranas were composed after this, hence these are scriptures of the Kali=
-Yuga, as are Tantras]
>>>>>
>>>>>
>>>>>3. These 10/9 Avataras have a fixed=
 sequence of appearance. Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashur=
ama, Rama, Krshna, (Buddha) and Kalki. There is an unmistakeable connection=
 of the form and sequence of these main avatars with the evolution of life =
on earth. From the aquatic, to the amphibian, to the land-animal, to the ha=
lf-animal-half-man, to the dwarf man (first human life form who immediately=
 takes possession of this earth represented by Vamana's 3 steps), to the Ra=
jashik avatara of Parashurama moving around with an axe, to the Sattwa Guna=
 Avatara of Rama, to the Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, this indicates th=
at spirituality is not to be separated into another world, but is a progres=
sive realization of the various manifestation and potentials that lie inher=
ent in the consciousness and its development through various life-forms. La=
rger spirituality of earth and evolution go hand in hand. That is Nature's =
grand design for life on
 earth.
>>>>>
>>>>>
>>>>>4. In this specifc contex=
t, I am only focusing on the parable of these main 9/10 Avatars. It is not =
my contention that if one worships say Matysa Avatara, one will not attain =
to a state of liberation of the soul. As is the nature of spiritual cosmolo=
gy in Hinduism, any Devata can lead a person to any depth of realization. A=
nd each one of the Avatars of Vishnu are self-realized in their own way and=
 can be consider super-massive spiritual dynamos.
>>>>>

>>>>>
>>>>>=
=C2=A05. Of these, naturally, Rama and Krshna are most adored because they =
represent a stage of evolution, both inside as well as outside, which socie=
ty can relate of much easier, in this age. Rama represents, for me, the sta=
ge of most satwic mind. A satwic mind is in control of itself. It known how=
 to transform the animal tendencies within and without - monkeys - into a c=
onstructive force for a greater purpose. However, as with a state of full S=
attwa Guna, there can be instances, even though few, of dejection. For it i=
s static in nature and will change only when circumstances force it to. As =
per the Valmiki Ramayana, Rama did feel dejected while searching for Sita i=
n the forest. He did have a moments fear before the final assault on Ravana=
, which was dispelled by Agsatha when the later revealed the stotra of the =
Sun to Rama. At the end of the final battle, Rama tells Sita, in a most dis=
passionate manner, that he killed Ravana not to rescue her, but it
 was the=
 Dharma to do so, and to unhold his family honour. That too was the dharma =
of that age when he lived, family honor. The way I look at this grand epic,=
 and I bow humbly to the genius of Rishis Valmiki for representing the thin=
gs as they are, as a scribe, as a poet, as an observer, and not adding his =
own preferences to it anywhere, in the 14 years of tribulation that Rama fa=
ced which culminated into his killing Ravana, he changed into the most disp=
assionate leader, such that no personal consideration or emotions or passio=
ns can overturn the Rajadharma. His life is a lesson of what a true leader =
must be! Krshna, OTOH, had this immaculate detachment right from birth. I a=
m not taking his=C2=A0 supernatural feats into account. It is his singular =
and constant detachment from situations, from people, from environment, fro=
m circumstances that mark his life. At the age of eight, he decides to leav=
e Vrindavana for Mathura. All his friends, his foster parents,
 his village=
-folks who so loved him, pleaded with him that it would make no sense for h=
im to leave the shelter, love and comfort of his happy, settled village lif=
e and head into an unknown destiny and destination. Krshna tried to reason =
with them, then he understood that they won't understand, he promised he wi=
ll return back once his work in Mathura is over. He never returned. Later, =
much later, when the Gopis came to him asking him to participate in their d=
ance, he obliged. But the moment some of them started getting jealous and p=
ossessive of Krshna, he removed himself quietly from the scene, saying that=
 he belongs to everyone equally and no one has any special right over him. =
When Shishupala abused Krshna, the later merely kept dropping flowers on th=
e floor, smiling and counting. The moment the 100th abuse was over, he swif=
tly cut off Shishupala's head and was back into his poise. But when Bhurish=
rava unfairly accused Krshna of being a revolutionist
 and charlatan, Krshn=
a did not kill him. When Duryodhana, who used to think of Krshna as another=
 black magician, wanted to arrest him, Krshna showed his vikarala roopa in =
the assembly of kings, yet he did not finish the enemies off. The very next=
 moment he was back into his own poised self. Never in the whole Mahabharat=
a is there one instance of his going overboard, never a single shade of dep=
ression, equivocation, or lack of confidence in his actions, irrespective o=
f what others say or think of him. And then right in the middle of the grea=
test war he had the perfect equipoise to deliver the most sublime spiritual=
 philosophy. That is why his life remains the best ideal of Karma-Yoga. For=
 a true Karma-Yogi by definition can never be dejected. It is impossible. N=
either the action nor the results belong to the instrument. When running aw=
ay from the battle-field and killing Kaliya Yavana, or when advising Bheema=
 to tear apart Jarashanda, or gesturing Bheema
 to hit Duryodhana below the=
 waist, or getting Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krshna, as if by some Divine I=
ntuition, knew exactly how the situations must be lined up which would caus=
e the destruction of these people. This kind of knowledge cannot come by th=
e rational thinking. But happens when one is constantly and consciously con=
nected to the Universal Force. We do not find these kind of complex situati=
ons in the Rama Avatara, at least in the Valmiki Ramayana. Of course, if we=
 take the Adhbut Ramayana or such other auxilliary texts and retelling, we =
get a different picture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana we have a 1000 headed demo=
n attacking Rama after he kills Ravana, and then Sita turns into Adya Shakt=
i and demolishes the 1000 headed demon and Rama worships her. But if we tak=
e only the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the picture that emerges is very c=
lear. Rama is the embodiment of Sattwic mind. Therefore he displays all the=
 great characteristics of satwa, chief
 of which is self-control, as well a=
s the occasional sadness caused due to separation from his wife Sita whom, =
at least until Ravana was destroyed, he loved very dearly. Satwa guna creat=
es a true saint, but can also cause some grief when the stability is shaken=
. Krshna was gunatita. He had no attachment to anything in this world - man=
, women, deva, danava, friend, enemy - and therefore he was never affected =
any trace of negative emotion. His Ananda never left him even in the most t=
rying situations. 6. Buddha was great spiritual force in this world. But I =
do not see him fit in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His realization, =
the one he advocated, is a static realization, an end in a void. This is cl=
early denying of the reality of this earth. I find this not in tune with wh=
at either Rama or Krshna espoused. None of them negated this world. If nega=
tion of this world and life is the final aim, then why send so many avatars=
 at crucial stages of
 evolutionary development? If the spiritual impact on=
 masses is the reason for Buddha being an Avatara, then why not Jesus or Zo=
rathrusta.? They are no less impactful in that sense. But do they fit in th=
e scheme of spiritual line that these 9 Avataras of Narayana indicate in a =
most logical manner? No. As such many vaishnava traditions in parts of Indi=
a, do not consider Buddha to be an avatara. Realization, to be complete and=
 holistic, must be both static and dynamic, outside of life as well as insi=
de of life. That is why the Tantras formed their own kind of spiritual phil=
osophy, of the world as body of Shakti and therefore an object of reverence=
 and realization. 7. The original literature of the Nath Yogis used to ment=
ion 9 chakras. These are centers of psychological functions. 6 inside the h=
uman body and 3 too subtle, or non-developed in most people, even seekers. =
It is my belief that each of the 9 Avataras - excluding Buddha - correspond=
 to the full
 power and force of one of these 9 Chakras. Similarly, the 9 g=
rahas, or that which can modify consciousness or allow the consciousness to=
 explore and express itself is various possiblities, are 9 in number. The l=
agna is a reference point and not a graha. Therefore the chief Avatars who =
represent the parable of evolution are nine in number. And the ninth of the=
 sequence is yet to come. 8. I cannot comment on which graha would typicall=
y represent which Avatara. I know of what the BPHS says, however, it is my =
belief - feel free to disagree with it -:)[one cannot rule out some deep-ro=
oted corruption of understanding or textual misrepresentation in this Kali-=
Yuga] - that the Atmah among the Avataras has not yet appeared. It will be =
Kalki, or as Vimalananda seems to say in the Aghora books, Nishkalanka - th=
e stainless one. There is only one thing which is perfectly stainless, the =
Atmah .After a Nirguna/Gunatita awastha comes living in the full and comple=
te
 purity and might and force and strength of the Atmah. By the sheer dint=
 of his purity the last Avatara will burn away opposing forces of this worl=
d and fulfill the purpose of evolution. Even Krshna used diplomacy at vario=
us points in his adult life to achieve his ends. Kalki, I am speculating, w=
on't even need that. The white horse and that sword is a metaphor. He will =
be the only one capable enough to rectify the various errors and corruption=
s that beset our age. Well, this is how I look at the story of Avataras. It=
 is perfectly ok not to agree with my views, but I am reasonably sanguine n=
ow that this is what is closer to truth. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi
