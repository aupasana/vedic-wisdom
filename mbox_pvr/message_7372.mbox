Namaste Sir,
=A0
As this can be useful to others, I am cc'ing the reply to =
vedic-wisdom yahoogroup. But I am keeping your identity confidential. I am =
bcc'ing this reply to you.

=A0
Ancient dharma shastras obviously do not ta=
lk about this, for there was no christianity and coversions then.
=A0
Dharm=
a means the "right thing to do" and it depends on the person and the situat=
ion. True dharma is deciphered for each situation, though dharma shastras T=
RY to standardize things and give GENERAL guidance. That's why dharma shast=
ras are updated from time to time for the desa-kaala and there are so many =
of them.
=A0
All rituals are tools that try to catalyze certain internal tr=
ansformations that cause corresponding external changes, as the microcosm (=
one person) is a mapping of the entire macrocosm (universe). Irrespective o=
f whether one is a practicing Hindu or a convert to Christianity, just doin=
g final rites casually and without mental involvement is useless, i.e. noth=
ing happens as a result. Irrespective of whether one is a practicing Hindu =
or a convert to Christianity, if one does the rites imagining and believing=
 deeply that the soul of the departed parent is being lifted up by higher b=
eings to higher realms of awareness, that imagery/thinking produces some ch=
anges in the microcosm and also resonates to the external world. Indeed som=
e benefit occurs to the departed parent.
=A0
The key is faith in the ritual=
 and the ability/purity to imagine/visualize things. If one left Hinduism a=
nd converted to Christianity, it is likely that one has no faith in Hindu r=
ituals. However, if one does indeed have faith and can visualize things, th=
e ritual will work.
=A0
Strictly speaking, I do not think much of divisions=
 like Hinduism, Christianity etc. To a Sanatana Dharmi like me, everybody b=
elongs to the same religion - Sanatana Dharma. Some are good at following S=
anatana Dharma and some are bad, but all belong to the family of Sanatana D=
harma. Some "Hindus" who do not follow their dharma (which is best intimate=
d by one's own inner conscience!) are worse at adhering to Sanatana Dharma =
than some "Christians" who do follow their dharma and listen to their inner=
 conscience.

=A0

Best regards,
Narasimha

Dear Sri Narasimha,

Pranam, I used to be associated with <deleted> earlier=
 and one question is
tormenting my mind for some time and don't know whom t=
o ask. I had read lots
of your articles on jyotish and shastras and felt yo=
u could clarify my
question.

Can a Hindu converted to a Christian do the f=
inal rites of his Hindu
parents?
What Hindu dharma shastras say on this?

P=
lease guide me on this.
I request you to please keep this as confidential a=
s it's a bit sensitive
issue for me.

Thanks..
