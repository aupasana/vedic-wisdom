Namaste,

We tell a young student to study well and get good scores in exam=
inations. We tell him that he should go to so and so institution (e.g. IIT,=
 IISc, , REC, IIM etc). But we know that going to IIT or getting 90% score =
in exams is NOT the goal of education. The goal of education is to understa=
nd the subject well and have a good career. It is possible to get 90% score=
 without understanding well and it is possible to go to IIT and not underst=
and the subject well.

Similarly, the goal of spiritual sadhana is to get b=
etter control over mind, overcome the internal enemies as much as possible =
and become liberated. But, we tell people to do so and so rituals, follow s=
o and so procedures/formulas, go to so and so temple etc.

Some formulas we=
re created so that there is some structure to sadhana. But there is nothing=
 absolute about those formulas.

Yes, if your gurus told you the formula of=
 n times japam, n/10 times homam, n/100 times tarpana etc and you want to f=
ollow it, please do so. No harm in it. Some people believe that such a proc=
edure gives "siddhi" in a mantra.

However, please note that there are many=
 people who did purascharanas using such formulas and did not really get an=
y "siddhi" in the mantra. On the other hand, there are people who did not s=
tick to those formulas and yet found god through the mantra.

In my opinion=
, you can do just japam with a mantra without worrying about 1/10th count h=
omam, 1/100th count tarpana etc. Or you can also do a mantra entirely in ho=
mam without any japam or tarpana. Choose one practice and do it until your =
mind is so absorbed in it that your mind is chanting that mantra sub-consci=
ously when it is free (like some people hum catchy songs when they are free=
).

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

Regarding the astrological formulas for evaluating th=
e impact of a mantra, I would like disown those concepts originally taught =
by Pt Sanjay Rath and shared by me in my astrology classes. There are many =
technicalities, but many many corruptions in the way knowledge is preserved=
. Most rules and technicalities of mantra shashtra apply to people who do p=
rayogas to get specific material results (and naturally those rules have be=
en intentionally corrupted by Nature in preparation of deepening Kali).

Bo=
ttomline is that a mantra done for spiritual progress works based on your m=
ental visualization of the mantra and its deity and the latent forces of co=
nditioning in your mind. All the house calculations based on the numbers of=
 letters and number of words are irrelevant. Moreover, a veda mantra like G=
ayatri mantra can be done by anyone without worrying about technicalities.
=

Regarding adding "Om" or "Om Bhur bhuvas suvah" or Om bhuh om bhuvah om su=
vah om mahah.." etc, there are many standard approaches. I suggest using wh=
at you were taught by your gurus and not worrying too much about it.

=A0=C2=A0 *

Utpal asked about count vs time. Counts sometimes force people=
 to speed things up. In my humble opinion, it is fine or even better to set=
 a time limit (e.g. one hour, two hours etc) and do japam for that time irr=
espective of the count.

Narasimha

      Narasimhagaru, 
=C2=A0
Thank you for such a nic=
e explanation. Even with not maintaining Brahmacharya, I could see signific=
ant progress in terms of my control of temper etc. when I did Gayatri Japam=
 in the past. Did not know the significance of Brahmacharya then (in future=
 I will practise with Brahmacharya) . But the way I did was it was one a la=
kh purascharana (daily 1000-3000 times) for a period of two months and then=
 I did a homam to complete the dasamsa in homam. For the homam, however, I =
have called about 10 people (Grihastas / Brahmacharis altogether) and we al=
l did chant the mantra while I performed the homam. This is how our Sharmaj=
i instructed us to do. So, is a Dasamsa homam, satamsa for tarpanam, sahasr=
amsa for marjanam and finally dasamsa of shasramsa for feeding the number o=
f brahmins (so basically, for a laksha Gayatri, 10 brahmins must be fed, to=
 finish the ritual of purascharana) . This is how I thought the big japams =
must be done. Can you shed more light on
 this? 
=C2=A0
Also, Gayatri mantr=
a is a 24 syllable mantra starting with tatsavitur.. .., but if the vyahrit=
is are added it becomes a 30 letter mantra (om bhur bhu va ssu vah=C2=A0). =
How should this be practised? 30, I suppose strengthens the 6th house, wher=
eas the 24 strengthens the 12th house, according to your explanation? Sorry=
 for digressing into astrology ! (but they are tightly integrated here and =
could not avoid this question). Please tell me if my interpretation is righ=
t and also please tell me which approach is better. 
=C2=A0

Namaste,

What=
 he wrote was to do Savitri Gayatri mantra 1000 times everyday in one sitti=
ng and do like that for 100 days at a stretch without break. Then possibly =
give a break for a few days and do for another 100 days. Like that, do for =
3 stretches of 100 days each.

Of course, if needs no break, one can do 300=
 days in a row too. But, keeping brahmacharya (abstinence) may be difficult=
 for some people and hence the suggestion of the break.

For success in any=
 sadhana, brahmacharya is very important. Restraint from sex and control of=
 anger and short-temper will help one avoid leakage of shakti (purifying en=
ergy). Everytime one experiences lust, anger etc, one loses some shakti.

E=
very factor contributes a little to success. Beard is useful. The tradition=
 of growing beard exists in many religions and it is not without a reason. =
We discussed this sometime back.

If one is living a lifestyle where one av=
oids
 contact with any tempting situations altogether (e.g. living in a rem=
ote monastery), beard may or may not add much value. But, if one is living =
a lifestyle where one comes in contact with tempting situations regularly (=
e.g. living in the modern world with a family and job and a TV), beard can =
be very useful. As I said earlier when we discussed this, beard is not the =
complete solution but a small part of the solution. Just as a railing on th=
e side of a hill road may stop a slowly moving car from sliding off the hil=
l at night but be unable to stop a fast moving car out of control, similarl=
y a beard can help a person with decent control over the mind to retain con=
trol in some tricky situations.

Trimming beard is ok.

If =
one indeed does 1000 times Gayatri (or any mantra for a couple of hours) ev=
eryday for one year while maintaining brahmacharya,
 
while following the s=
imple rules of same place, same time everyday and facing the same direction=
, one will certainly make good progress. Brahmacharya is one key thing and =
sitting still with an erect back, neck and head with the eyes closed is the=
 other thing. The probability of mind becoming still is almost zero if the =
body is not still. If the body can be kept very still, there is a chance th=
at mind will also become still for a moment. If the mind is still for even =
a moment, it will cause great bliss. As mind gets more used to being still,=
 it will become still more often and for longer times. Then various kinds o=
f samadhis become possible.

Narasimha

This is a great mail and very inspiring. However, =
I have one question on Sri Manishji's advise on how to carry out the sadhan=
a. He says do it for 100 days and repeat the whole procedure for 3 times. S=
o, should we do 3000 times japam in a day for 100 days or do 1000 times eve=
ry day for=C2=A0300 days? He also says 'Grow a beard'. Now, in a profession=
al corporate life, that could be a difficult thing. How about trimming it?.=
... just to be tolerable to other people. Maybe my question is silly but it=
 is genuine.

<div>Thank =
you for such a nice explanation. Even with not maintaining Brahmacharya, I =
could see significant progress in terms of my control of temper etc. when I=
 did Gayatri Japam in the past. Did not know the significance of Brahmachar=
ya then (in future I will practise with Brahmacharya) . But the way I did w=
as it was one a lakh purascharana (daily 1000-3000 times) for a period of t=
wo months and then I did a homam to complete the dasamsa in homam. For the =
homam, however, I have called about 10 people (Grihastas / Brahmacharis alt=
ogether) and we all did chant the mantra while I performed the homam. This =
is how our Sharmaji instructed us to do. So, is a Dasamsa homam, satamsa fo=
r tarpanam, sahasramsa for marjanam and finally dasamsa of shasramsa for fe=
eding the number of brahmins (so basically, for a laksha Gayatri, 10 brahmi=
ns must be fed, to finish the ritual of purascharana) . This is how I thoug=
ht the big japams must be done. Can you shed more light on
 this? </div>
<d=
iv> </div>
<div>Also, Gayatri mantra is a 24 syllable mantra starting =
with tatsavitur.. .., but if the vyahritis are added it becomes a 30 letter=
 mantra (om bhur bhu va ssu vah ). How should this be practised? 30, I=
 suppose strengthens the 6th house, whereas the 24 strengthens the 12th hou=
se, according to your explanation? Sorry for digressing into astrology ! (b=
ut they are tightly integrated here and could not avoid this question). Ple=
ase tell me if my interpretation is right and also please tell me which app=
roach is better. </div>

<br>Of course, if needs no break, one can do 300 days in a row too. But, ke=

the suggestion of the break.<br><br>For success in any sadhana, brahmachary=

ng in the modern world with a family and job and a TV), beard can be very u=
seful. As I said earlier when we discussed this, beard is not the complete =
solution but a small part of the solution. Just as a railing on the side of=
 a hill road may stop a slowly moving car from sliding off the hill at nigh=
t but be unable to stop a fast moving car out of control, similarly a beard=

lowing the simple rules of same place, same time everyday and facing the sa=
me direction, one will certainly make good progress. Brahmacharya is one ke=
y thing and sitting still with an erect back, neck and head with the eyes c=
losed is the other thing. The probability of mind becoming still is almost =
zero if the body is not still. If the body can be kept very still, there is=
 a chance that mind will also become still for a moment. If the mind is sti=
ll for even a moment, it will cause great bliss. As mind gets more used to =
being still, it will become still more often and for longer times. Then var=
ious kinds of samadhis become possible.<br><br>Best regards,<br>Narasimha<b=

<div>This is a great mail and very=
 inspiring. However, I have one question on Sri Manishji's advise on how to=
 carry out the sadhana. He says do it for 100 days and repeat the whole pro=
cedure for 3 times. So, should we do 3000 times japam in a day for 100 days=
 or do 1000 times every day for 300 days? He also says 'Grow a beard'.=
 Now, in a professional corporate life, that could be a difficult thing. Ho=
