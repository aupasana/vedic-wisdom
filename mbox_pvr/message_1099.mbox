Namaste Sir,
 
When you do a ritual like homam or just meditate with a mant=
ra, it generates a spiritual energy around your being. Different mantras an=
d different homas generate different kinds of energy. I was pointing out th=
at Chandi homam tends to generate different kinds of energy at daytime and =
night time. Energy tapped by Chandi homam at night is likely to be more fie=
rce and raw.
 
If one has a subtle perception, one may be able to perceive =
this energy. If one is ready to be absorbed in that energy and let it purif=
y one, one will benefit from it. But, some may be scared or otherwise put o=
ff by it.
 
So I recommend doing Chandi homam in the daytime only.
 
But, I=
 see no issues with doing Mahaganapathi homam in the night.
 
Best regards,=

Narasimha

     Namaste,

          Yes, Mahaganapathi homam can be performed in the n=
ight too. In fact, the most pleasant Mahaganapathi homam I have ever attend=
ed was performed in the back yard of a priest's house, right next to a rive=
r, on a night. I practically know that it is perfectly fine to do Maha Gana=
pathi homam in the night and the energy generated is still pleasant and saa=
ttwik.

          However, if you do Chandi homam, my advice is to do it in=
 daytime, atleast in the beginning. The energy that manifests is different =
at night than at daytime, especially with Chandi homam. If you are unable t=
o perceive that energy, then there is no problem and no difference between =
day and night. But, if you are able to perceive that fierce energy and if i=
t scares you, that may be bad. Thus, it is better in the beginning to do Ch=
andi homam during the daytime.

          For Lakshmi homam also, daytime i=
s preferred. But night is also acceptable.

          Other homas are ok an=
ytime.

          Best regards,
          Narasimha

                    Na=
maste,

                    I am glad to know that. With practice, it will =
become smooth and you can 
                    start to focus better of man=
tra.

                    When priests perform homam on a grand scale, they=
 distribute the tasks among 
                    them. If you do on a small=
er scale by yourself, you can do everything by 
                    yoursel=
f. In fact, the latter is better.

                    In fact, even when m=
any priests do it together with one fire, it is good to 
                  =
  have one person managing the fire and offerings. If one chants, one prepa=
res 
                    and chooses offerings and one finally makes the of=
ferings in the fire, that 
                    is better than everybody mak=
ing different offerings in fire. Ideally, the 
                    contact =
with fire should be from one person. Of course, if each has a 
            =
        separate homa kundam, all can make offerings in fire.

            =
        Never think in terms of keeping the positive vibrations to yourself=
 or 
                    within your house. Fire is the basis of creation. =
Fire rituals are important 
                    to maintain dharma in this =
universe and promote creation and sustenance. Do 
                    homam=
 thinking that you are doing your dharma and have no other thoughts of 
   =
                 motives. Of course, if you do your dharma by helping natur=
e, nature WILL 
                    reward you for it. But leave it to natu=
re and do your part selflessly. 
                    Self-centeredness is a=
n acid of which a single drop is sufficient to break 
                    t=
he milk of your ritual.

                    Actually, a homam done under t=
he sky (i.e. in open air) is better than one 
                    done unde=
r a roof (i.e. inside a house). However, when one cannot do in open 
      =
              air, one can do inside a house also.

yourself, you can do everything by 
                    <BR>yourself. In fa=
ct, the latter is better.<BR><BR>In fact, 
                    even when ma=

                    good to=

If one chants, one prepares <BR>and chooses offerings and 
                =
    one finally makes the offerings in the fire, that <BR>is 
             =
       better than everybody making different offerings in fire. 
         =
           Ideally, the <BR>contact with fire should be from one 
         =
           person. Of course, if each has a <BR>separate homa kundam, 
    =
                all can make offerings in fire.<BR><BR>Never think in terms=
 
                    of keeping the positive vibrations to yourself or <BR=
>within 
                    your house. Fire is the basis of creation. Fir=
e rituals are 
                    important <BR>to maintain dharma in this=
 universe and 
                    promote creation and sustenance. Do <BR>=
homam thinking that 
                    you are doing your dharma and have=
 no other thoughts of

o your dharma by helping 
                    nature, nature WILL <BR>rewar=
d you for it. But leave it to 
                    nature and do your part =
selflessly. <BR>Self-centeredness is 
                    an acid of which =
a single drop is sufficient to break

our ritual.<BR><BR>Actually, a homam done 
                    under the sk=
y (i.e. in open air) is better than one <BR>done
