Nations always go through cycles of expansion and shrin=
king. Just like individual beings cannot escape from the cycle of life and =
death and the cycle of happiness and sadness, so can't nation escape from t=
he cycle of expansion and shrinking and the cycle of prosperity and adversi=
ty. The only difference is that the periods are much longer in the case of =
nations.
 
What is more alarming than the *nation* of *India* shrinking is =
that Hinduism or sanatana dharma is shrinking in the world. Though probably=
 there are more Hindus in the world today than a few hundred years back, th=
ere are fewer people who truly stick to sanatana dharma today than a few hu=
ndred years back. *That* is the real concern.
 
Now, how do you solve this =
problem? As the gentleman below says, you can "awake, arise and fight till =
the goal is achieved". But, I want to point out that there are different fr=
ontiers fighting at different levels in each "fight". Because the list "siv=
acharya" contains many priests, I want to point out the role that can be pl=
ayed by spiritual people and yogis in a dharmic battle (dharma yuddha).
 
L=
et me use the example of Shivaji to illustrate my point. Those who think th=
e military victories of Shivaji were only due to his bravery and tactical b=
rilliance are missing a very key enabling factor. The sadhana of Samartha R=
amadas, the great yogi who was his guru, was not any less factor than Shiva=
ji's bravery.
 
If you become like Samartha Ramadas, a Shivaji will automat=
ically come and lead a fight. Brave soldiers will automatically come and jo=
in that Shivaji. As Krishna says in BhagavadGeetha, everybody has to follow=
 "own dharma". A Brahmana can follow his own dharma and make a big differen=
ce in a fight in a totally invisible fashion. If one does spiritual sadhana=
 with a specific sankalpa to increase dharma in the world, it is bound to m=
ake a difference sooner or later.
 
Specifically, if a handful of people st=
art performing Chandi homam twice a day in various parts of the world, with=
 the specific sankalpa of establishing sanatana dharma in the world (and wi=
thout *diluting* it by adding any other individual sankalpas), I am confide=
nt that world will change. I have no doubt. The key would be for each perso=
n to pick a place and do homam in the morning and evening in the *same* pla=
ce (as opposed to roaming around and doing in different places) and do it a=
round the same times every morning and evening. If three homas can be perfo=
rmed everyday, that will be even better. On the other side, if two cannot b=
e performed and only one can be performed everyday, that can also be useful=
.
 
The opulence of the materials burnt in the homam hardly matters. She do=
es not distinguish between a small cotton cloth and an opulent silk saree. =
We, ordinary people, differentiate. For Her, everything is the same - both =
are clothes. Materials that one can afford can be used. If one is performin=
g a selfish ritual for *individual* good (of a person or a family or a comm=
unity or a nation etc), then materials commensurate with the goal are requi=
red. But, if one is performing a selfless ritual for increasing dharma in t=
he world, restrictions are fewer and materials matter little.
 
If the shlo=
kas are chanted with pure devotion and sincerity and with the perfect faith=
 that She is coming in the fire and receiving them, that is enough. If She =
is treated with respect, love and care while She is in fire, that is enough=
. Material deficiencies can be ignored. Even if they do an imperfect job, t=
he Mother makes it complete and perfect and accepts it! That faith has to b=
e complete. In fact, She *wants* people to do this, so that She can destroy=
 adharma in the world. But the nature of certain times is such that people =
do not do this. When the time to reduce adharma comes, She motivates some p=
eople to do this, they do it and then She acts on it. Though She is the one=
 who is inspiring some to do this, She needs them to act further. Fortunate=
 are those who get to play a role in this fascinating game with their belov=
ed Mother.
 
As the 12th adhyaya of saptashati says, "durvruttaanaam asesha=
anaam balahaanikaram param rakshobhootapisaachaanaam pathanaadeva naasanam"=
 (a mere reading of this reduces the strength of the many with a mean condu=
ct and destroys demons and evil spirits).
 
For establishing sanatana dharm=
a in the world, there is nothing better than a regular practice of Chandi h=
omam. Even Lord Rama performed it before battling Ravana.
 
If anybody real=
ly has the time, energy and material resources to perform a Chandi homam on=
e or two or three times everyday without any individual wishes but just for=
 increasing dharma in the world, I can give them a sankalpa (in Sanskrit) t=
hat they can take at the beginning. I can also privately teach a simple and=
 short procedure using which Chandi homam can be performed within 2 hours w=
ith some practice. Of course, most people on "sivacharya" yahoogroup may al=
ready be proficient in Chandi homam. I am talking about others.
 
Best rega=
rds,
Narasimha
