Namaste Sir,

I heard pravachanas by some of these popular religious teache=
rs of India like the gentleman you refer to. I appreciate them as they are =
serving the cause of Sanatana Dharma to the best of their ability and there=
 are a huge number of people who are in need of exactly that kind of servic=
e.

However, some genuine seekers may be misguided by some ill-digested, ha=
lf-baked, un-nuanced and misunderstood knowledge coming from them.

Om is t=
he essence of all mantras, just as Brahman (Self) is the essence of the cos=
mos. In Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna says "I am Om among all mantras". Other =
mantras have specific attributes and qualities. Even if one's mind abandons=
 all other thoughts and obtains tadrupata with mantra (i.e. merges in mantr=
a), one experiences only a specific manifestation of Self. Om is nearly dev=
oid of attributes and better-suited (though neither necessary not sufficien=
t!) for merging in Self. That is why it is considered the highest mantra an=
d some highly elevated yogis meditate only with Om.

Any teaching that medi=
tation with Om is prohibited for grihasthas may have originated from a fear=
 that family will be in trouble if one merges in Brahman. Three points are =
to be made here:

(1) Not everyone meditating with Om merges in Brahman any=
time soon. In fact, most people on earth today are not going to do that any=
time soon, irrespective of what mantra they use! They are burdened by too m=
uch conditioning and too many karmik debts..


(2) After becoming one with =
Self, one MAY come back and live as a liberated being (jeevanmukta). One ne=
ed not leave.


(3) If one has an unfulfilled karmik debt to anyone (includ=
ing family), Nature will NOT let one leave anyway. One will not be able to =
merge in Self despite best efforts, until debts are fulfilled.

If a grihas=
tha indeed merges in Brahman while meditating (with any mantra) and leaves,=
 there was no karmik debt blocking him/her from it. So, why worry and try t=
o prevent it? Nature will show the way to remaining family members based on=
 their destiny and what they deserve..

IMHO, there is no harm or danger in=
 meditating with Om for anyone. All fears are based on focus on the superfi=
cial aspects of knowledge and half-baked and ill-nuanced understanding of i=
ts essence.

If Om still scares you, thanks to this gentleman, just pick so=
me other mantra, e.g. "OM gaM gaNapataye namaH" or Shiva panchakshari or Vi=
shnu's shadakshari or ashtakshari or dwadasakshari. Even if one intends onl=
y Self-realization and no attachment to any forms, still one need not medit=
ate with Om right away. One can start off with something else and it can le=
ad to something else and finally Om at the right time.

Often, one leaves t=
hings to Nature (or a guru if one has one), right guidance comes at the rig=
ht time. Worrying or thinking too much often takes us away from the core sh=
eaths of our existence, which are providing proper guidance.


Best regards=
,

Narasimha
