Dear Sarbani,
 
One comment on the "pure" vs "impure" considerations regard=
ing planets as you broach on it:
 
ALL planets are ever pure in their fines=
t essence. After all, Parasara equated them to Vishnu's 10 incarnations. Th=
us, they cannot be impure. But, why do we look at some planets or some thin=
gs associated with some planets as impure? I will answer in a second.
 
The=
 supreme cosmic being, who has all gunas and yet untouched by gunas and who=
 does all actions of all beings in this world and yet untouched by any acti=
on, takes on various fundamental qualities and manifests as various planets=
. Thus, the innermost *essence* of each planet is basically a representatio=
n of the Infinite. It is ever pure.
 
However, an outer core evolves within=
 the framework of duality around the innermost essence of each planet. Thou=
gh the finest innermost essence of the planet is ever pure, this outer core=
 that develops around the planet may have various qualities and part of it =
may be seen as pure or part of it as impure, within the framework of dualit=
y. When people talk of planets, they are talking of the outer core and henc=
e they view planets as predominantly pure or predominantly impure and vario=
us things represented by a planet as pure or impure.
 
But remember that th=
e innermost core essence is perfectly pure for each planet. You can reach t=
he infinite by reaching the finest essence of ANY planet.
 
*        *     =
   *
 
Statements from tantra like Krishna being "saakshaat" (literally) Ka=
alika or equating either with a planet may baffle some. However, please not=
e that Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, who *understood by experience* the true nat=
ure of both Krishna and Kaali, said the same thing. He said that Krishna an=
d Kaali are essentially the same. He said the difference between them is ak=
in to the difference between Sun and Sun's rays.
 
When Vishnu avataras (or=
 mahavidyas) are equated to planets, please note that we are NOT talking ab=
out everything that the planet is associated with (i.e. outer core), but th=
e innermost essence of the planet that is ever pure and a representation of=
 the Infinite. THAT essence can be viewed as a Vishnu avatara as well as a =
mahavidya, with the difference between the two being quite subtle, like the=
 difference between Sun and Sun's rays.

Whether Chhinnamasta is "all ab=
out suppressing that" or about rising above it can be discussed later, as t=
hat is secondary. But, even as you dismiss the symbolism as "highly superfi=
cial", you ARE alluding to the symbolism when you finally say:
 
> Chhinnam=
asta represents that unleashed carnality of Rahu. Venus on the other
> hand=
 is the purest of them all.
 
It is Venus who actually shows carnal pleasur=
es and not Rahu. Rahu shows materialism, but carnal pleasures ARE shown by =
Venus. And that does not make him impure. Let us not change the basics of a=
strology and make Rahu the karaka of sex. It is Venus. Moreover, as you poi=
nted out, Chhinnamasta is also called Vajra Vairochani and is said to be lu=
strous and pure like a Vajra (diamond). Venus is the one associated with di=
amond.
 
Munda maalaa tantra equates Chhinnamasta with Bhargava Rama, who i=
s equated with Venus by Parasara. All the external symbolism around Chhinna=
masta (sex and other pleasures) matches the external qualities associated w=
ith Venus. Her internal nature described nicely by you below (yogic powers,=
 supreme bliss etc) also matches with Venus. Why then is suddenly Rahu brou=
ght into the picture? It should be Venus.
 
*        *        *
 
As Dattat=
reya's Avadhoota Gita teaches, actions are not what bind us, it is our ego =
(I-ness) identifying with (and attaching to) the actions that binds us. Whe=
n performed without any attachment whatsoever, no action is "impure". It is=
 our sense that "I am doing" and "I am enjoying" that introduces impurity. =
When that is completely absent, one is ever pure.
 
As actions provoking th=
e basic instincts within us are so difficult to perform without an identifi=
cation, a regular sadhaka is better off staying away from certain activitie=
s such as carnal pleasures. But it is *possible* to be established in Brahm=
an even during such activities considered impure, as demonstrated by Dattat=
reya. That is the way of Venus.
 
The way of Saturn is to silence the inter=
nal enemies and practice austerities. But the way of Venus is not to suppre=
ss so-called enjoyments, but to overcome the identification even when engag=
ing in so-called enjoyments.
 
After all, Venus is the teacher of demons. H=
e is in the middle of the demons and yet remains perfectly pure being a gre=
at yogi. This is a metaphor for the fact that internally Venus is *in* one'=
s passions and pleasures (including carnal ones) and yet he is absolutely p=
ure. At the outer core, Venus shows all enjoyment within one, including car=
nal pleasures. These things may seem dirty, like Chhinnamasta's surrounding=
s in iconography. If you go from the outer core to the innermost essence, t=
hen you catch hold of true essence of Venus, which is perfectly pure. And t=
he glow of *that* blissful yogic essence is Chhinnamasta. Once you catch ho=
ld of the true essence of Venus (or Chhinnamasta), you are liberated.
 
By =
perfecting various aspects of one's personality, i.e. by being one with the=
 innermost essence (not the outer core) of that aspect of one's personality=
, one reaches the fine essence of various planets and one can become libera=
ted. That is the point of mahavidyas.
 
As I said before, all the planets a=
re essentially ever pure, if you focus on their innermost essential nature =
and not the outward manifestation.

Actuall=
y, I have been a Mahalakshmi worshipper for more than 15 years and not real=

happened since then. Grace of a realized master can work wonders, even with=

Your long exposition on mahavidyas in mail=
 2 quoted below has nothing we have not heard before at SJC. But, the probl=
em is that it has no unfirm binding thread. You go on to say a lot of disjo=
int things about a deity and suddenly one planet is tied in at the end. The=
re is no flow of logic or uniform criteria used for linking planets.

There =
are two long paragraphs on Kaali, but only the above at the end tries to ex=
plain why Kaali should be shown by Saturn. Are you suggesting that only Kaa=
li cleanses sins and others do not? Secondly, are other mahavidyas also wor=
shipped on the tithis of their planets? After all, Ketu does not even have =
a tithi and he shows one mahavidya. Then what is the logic behind deducing =
the planet from the tithi in one case?
 
Using one parameter to map to one =
planet in one case and another parameter to map to another planet in anothe=
r case is inconsistent.
 
> The Moon attains its full 16 kalas on purnima; =
the devi is then Shodashi.
 
Why then doesn't Moon or Saturn (ruling Purnim=
a) show Shodasi?

Well, Mercury is NOT the most soumya of plan=
ets. In some charts, he can even be kroora. He simply behaves like his comp=
any.
 
In any case, again there is no logic behind the conclusion. Why is "=
prithvi tattva" Mercury associated with her? What about the tattvas of plan=
ets in other cases? Is "prithvi tattva" the only "very much saguna" thing? =
Is jala tattva or vaayu tattva nirguna?
 
> It is Chhinnamasta who has the =
power to cut the knots of

Again, the above conclusion comes af=
ter a really long exposition and the conclusion has nothing to do with the =
exposition. Do you mean to say that other mahavidyas cannot cut the knots o=
f Rahu?

Yes, I am aware t=
hat it is not an SJC invention. But it does not seem to be backed by any sc=
riptures and only backed by a relatively modern astrology text. Several peo=
ple may have been influenced by Bhattacharya's text.
 
Sarbani, you follow =
Sri Achyutananda. Sri Achyutananda said, according to a paper by Sanjay ji =
a decade ago, that a kali yuga sub-cycle within the current kali yuga ends =
around 2000 AD and a satya yuga sub-cycle starts. Isn't it possible that th=
e kali yuga sub-cycle corrupted some knowledge and some of it will be clean=
ed up in the current sub-cycle?

Dear Vishnu,
 
> 1)=
 Can any of you provide a direct quote from any of the 64 authentic
> tantr=
as that relates maha vidyas to planets?
 
I cannot. However, I have given a=
 quote from an authentic tantra regarding the linking of dasavataras with d=
asa mahavidyas and we are all aware of Parasara's quote equating planets wi=
th dasavataras. The best I can suggest is combining the two.
 
Planets are =
secondary here. The key is to understand the tattva (essence) of mahavidyas=
. Understand what kind of supreme liberating knowledge each mahavidya repre=
sents. Though using the correct planets helps you understand the tattva bet=
ter, we need NOT think in terms of planets.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
