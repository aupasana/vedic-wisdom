Yes, the two paths you mentioned are well-known (and mentioned in Yoga 
Vaasishtham), but they are not known as the positive and negative paths. The 
path of exclusion keeps on eliminating everything in this manifested world 
appearance as "this is not Self", in order to realize what IS Self. After 
eliminating everything, what is left is the Self/Brahman. This path 
predominantly exercises Pingala/Surya nadi (solar channel of energy flow).

The path of inclusion considers everything as Self. Even the limited 
manifestations of Brahman are considered as Self only and accepted thus. One 
sees Self in all that is manifested. This path predominantly exercises 
Ida/Chandra nadi (lunar channel of energy flow).

In both the paths, one overcomes the simple and finite concept of I-ness 
with something more infinite.

Best regards,
Narasimha
