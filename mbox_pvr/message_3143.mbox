Namaste friends,
 
Yes, as many sadhakas have said before, food, sex and sleep are big drawbacks. Even if one's body awareness is going down, food and sex increase the body awareness and pull one back into maaya. Sleep induces tamas and one is vulnerable to losing control over mind in sleep.
 
However, overcoming these natural needs of the body is not an easy task. It is a life-long sadhana. Do NOT be in a hurry. Engage in the right amounts of these things in order to survive and be functional in this material world. Slowly, however, try to downplay them in the mind and not spend much time on them mentally.
 
Suppose you did not eat well oneday. Instead of reminding yourself of it continuously, just try to forget it. Engage in these actions, but do not over-engage the mind in these activities before and after the actual action. People tend to think about such activities before and after. That mental activity increases the attachment to the act. Do not think too much about it before, just do it when the time comes and again do not think too much about it after.
 
It is not easy, but practice can bring huge changes in one! Remember that even great saints took a very long time to overcome these things.

I will tell a somewhat related story. I know first-hand about someone who was pushed to the edge by his spiritual master in order to overcome mental pre-occupatiton with "sleeping enough". This person used to sleep for 5 hours a day and think that that much is necessary.
 
There was a two-week period when his sleep suddenly disappeared. He could only get a very mild partial sleep for one hour every night for those 2 weeks. He had nothing else to be worried about or anxious about, but his mind was filled with tremendous anxiety due to this. He drives one hour in the morning and one hour in the evening everyday. He would feel a little sleepy while driving and somehow manage, but unable to sleep after coming home. He was very worried ("what if I fall asleep while driving and have an accident?").
 
His spiritual master told him, "my gurus are very old-fashioned yogis. Perhaps they are testing you. But don't worry. The trial will make you better". He smiled and said another time, "unless the existing personality is broken down, how can a new personality be created? I meditate here and you break down there. But don't worry. It will end well." Another time, he said, "you are a logical person. Your surrender is still not full. You think you can control things. See, you cannot even control your own sleep. You need to realize that you have no control over ANY thing and surrender FULLY - not just theoretically, but from the depth of your heart. Until then, this may continue."
 
The person considered using sleeping pills, but was worried about getting addicted. His spiritual master told him, "you are thinking too much about everything. You still think too much of your logical abilities, though they are of no help and what you need is surrender" and commanded him to try sleeping pills for a few days. He assured him he would not be addicted.
 
Suprisingly, this person took sleeping pills for 3-4 days and that did not help at all. He was still able to sleep for only an hour everyday and that too a partial sleep. He would be wide awake after that.
 
Interestingly, he continued to go to work and function normally during those 2 weeks.
 
After going through this for 10 days, slowly the understanding grew in him that he was unnecessarily worried. Krishna is the doer of all things - big and small. He was thinking "I am doing", and had expectations "I must do X, I must not do Y" and was carrying the burden of those expectations. If he lets Krishna do whatever the divine will is and goes with the flow without either being attached to (or repelled from) a possible event in future or regretting a past event, he can avoid the worry. He overcame his fears and worries. When he did not get sleep, he lied in his bed mentally chanting his mantra. When the thought crossed his mind "what if this lack of sleep for so many days makes me fall asleep while driving", he just told himself "whatever happens is Krishna's will. My will is useless. I will do what Krishna's will wants me to do. ANYTHING in Krishna's will is acceptable to me. Life and death, sleep and wakefulness, I should see no difference in anything. All are the same."
 
As such thinking slowly became truly internalized and natural (as opposed to artificially forced), he became prepared for anything and slowly his surrender to Krishna became stronger and stronger. After 3-4 days like that, his sleep returned. Oneday, he was in a very nice spiritual mood with a deep sense of surrender to Krishna and not caring about anything. After spending the whole day in that mood, he slept normally that night. His sleep returned as if the purpose for which it went on a vacation was served. He did not have any such problems later.
 
If he got to sleep very little on some days due to various activities earlier, he used to consciously think about not sleeping enough sleep. Now, he sleeps 4-6 hours when he gets a chance and does not think much if he does not get to sleep that much on a day.

Pushing oneself to the edge can do the trick for some sadhakas. But, some may not be able to withstand it. I suggest working on the attitude slowly.
 
Before cutting the dependence on something, one can first try to cut the mental activity surrounding it and try to not think too much about that thing. Slowly, that may help one cut the dependence fully.
 
Eat less, but enough to function. Sleep less, but enough to function. Follow physical brahmacharya for small periods of time at a strecth (e.g. 40 days, 60 days, 80 days, 108 days, one year etc) and slowly try to take the mind off that.
 
Even when engaging in these activities, try to minimize the mental activity related to those activities, before and after the activity.
 
With this, slowly some progress will come. But remember that Rome is not built in a day!
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
