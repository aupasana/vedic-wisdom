Dear Hari,
 
Repeating any combination of syllables with a focussed mind wi=
ll eventually do the trick on the mind. So you may do either.
 
However, so=
me combinations tried by others successfully in the past are better and fas=
ter.
 
Regarding the specific mantra below: The words "raam" and "jay" (or =
"jai") have no meaning in Sanskrit. They should be "raama" and "jaya" respe=
ctively. Arabic has words mostly ending in consonants (i.e. no vowel "a" at=
 the end of the word). That Arabic influence made Indians change Sanskrit w=
ords to remove "a" at the end of words. "Jaya Raama" becomes "Jay Raam".
 
=
If you want your mantra to be meaningful in Sanskrit, please restore "a" at=
 the end of words. The correct version of the mantra is "Sree Raama Jaya Ra=
ama Jaya Jaya Raama". You can add "Om" at the beginning.
 
*        *      =
  *
 
On our India trip in the summer of 2008, I and my guru went to many t=
emples. There was one remote temple in BriahdDwaraka that had a nice level =
of spiritual vibrations. It is a temple of Hanuman and Makaradhwaja (Hanuma=
n's son) together. Apparently some yogi did intense sadhana there for a few=
 decades in the past (with the mantra you mentioned). The mantra above is w=
ritten all over the walls of the temple.
 
Though that yogi is not there no=
w, the vibrations created by his sadhana are still there. We were quite imp=
ressed when we spent some time there. You have to take a boat to go from Dw=
aarakaa to BrihadDwaarakaa and then go inside the village (a few km from th=
e main Krishna temple at BrihadDwaarakaa). It is a very small temple withou=
t any crowd, but has stronger spiritual energy than many famous temples. If=
 any of you go to Dwaraka or Gujarat in general, I recommend visiting that =
temple and spending a couple of hours there.
 
The mantra you gave reminded=
 me of that temple.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

  Dear Fellow travellers, namaste


  All this talk =
about Mangal reminds me about one question I've had for quite sometime. Som=
etime ago, Sanjayji had advised me to go to any Hanuman temple and get a ma=
ntra for lifting up the Mangal in my natal chart which suffers from rajabha=
nga (uccha in rasi and neecha in navamsa). When I visited the Hanuman deity=
 in Sri Veetirundha Perumal temple, Thirumazhisai near Chennai and asked th=
e priest about a mantra, he advised me to chant the mantra inscribed on the=
 walls of the temple |sri ram jaya ram jaya jaya ram| which comes out to be=
 a 7 word, 10 aksharas mantra. Energy from the 7th house to the 10th house =
with the mantra devata sitting in lagna as per mantra shastra teachings. I'=
ve been doing this every evening since.


  Later I came to know this is th=
e Rama taraka mantra. My question is how does this mantra help to counter t=
he rajabhanga of Mangal?


  Secondly what is the correct form of the Rama =
taraka mantra? Is it


  |om sri ram jaya ram jaya jaya ram| - 8 words, 11 =
aksharas


  or


  |om sri rama jaya rama jaya jaya rama|? - 8 words, 14 a=
ksharas


  Some say it should be 13 aksharas....


  Sorry for astrologica=
l content in this mail.


  best regards
  Hari
