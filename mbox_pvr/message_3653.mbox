Namaste,

A few quick points:

(1) =
There is no absolute right and wrong. Dharma often requires judging and bal=
ancing different criteria and the judgment may vary from place to place, ti=
me to time and person to person.

Uncooked (raw) rice grains last a long ti=
me without getting spoiled, but cooked rice grains get spoiled fast. Unfort=
unately, people cannot eat raw grains. So someone cooks for them. Do not ex=
pect cooked grains to last a long time, even if a great cook cooked them.

=
Similarly, generic and raw spiritual teachings given in scriptures and taug=
ht by great yogis (e.g. Brahman alone is real. World is maayaa. Do good to =
others. Sacrifice your happiness for others) are relevant always, while ver=
y specific guidelines given by great yogis in specific circumstances (e.g. =
It is ok to eat fish, but focus mind on god. It is ok to do homam with must=
ard oil instead of ghee. If someone comes to you and asks for money, give w=
hatever you have) may have been given keeping the circumstances in mind and=
 may be irrelevant in other circumstances.

If I reject spoiled food cooked=
 by my wife who is out of town and instead eat food made by my sister-in-la=
w, it is not disrespectful to my wife. She would not have expected me to ha=
ng on to her food and eat it even after it expires.

Unfortunately, many gr=
eat yogis give specific guidelines to people based on the circumstances (de=
sa-kaala- paatra), as people are not smart enough to know the right thing i=
f given only generic guidelines and want specific guidance. So they run the=
 risk of someone using the guideline meant for a specific circumstance in o=
ther inapplicable circumstances while attributing it to them.

(2) Eating t=
he meat of an animal that self-identifies with the body parts strongly is a=
lways a much stronger karma than eating the stuff from plants that have muc=
h subtler self-identification with the leaves and vegetables they grow. Irr=
espective of which spiritual giants ate fish in the past, it is bad karma.
=

All of us do many bad karmas and many good karmas and hope for them balanc=
e out. Vivekananda and Ramakrishna did so many good karmas, so many austeri=
ties and such intense spiritual sadhana. It may have offset any bad karma a=
ccumulated by eating fish during the time they were not yet fully realized =
(after full realization, there are no karmas).

(3) In the old days - even =
a century back - people did much more sadhana than now and lived simpler an=
d purer lifestyles. Now-a-days, we live in the middle of deep pollution - p=
hysical as well as spiritual - and our minds are bombarded with so much cor=
rupting influence. One may do a homam in the evening, go and turn on the TV=
 and the sitcom coming on TV during prime time may have sexual innuendo. On=
e may check email and get a spam mail about sexuality. There are images of =
half-naked people and struggle for money everywhere. There are too many tem=
ptations for the mind and too many opportunities to fall and commit bad kar=
mas (physically or mentally). The world of today is more challenging for a =
sadhaka than at the time of Vivekananda.

How good shoes one wears may not =
matter if one is walking on a normal road in summer. One should better wear=
 good shoes if one is walking on an icy pavement during winter, lest one sh=
ould fall!

When there is so much corrupting influence around us that we ca=
nnot control and that is challenging us, we can atleast control our own act=
ions and habits and minimize the bad karmas we regularly commit and the cha=
nce of a fall.

(4) When Lord Vishnu came to earth as Lord Rama, he taught =
the importance of Eka Patni Vrata (having only one wife). When he came back=
 as Lord Krishna, he did not emphasize that anymore and had many wives. Whe=
n he came as Lord Narasimha or Lord Rama, he killed demons. When he came as=
 Lord Buddha, he taught non-violence.

When yogis like Ramakrishna, Vivekan=
anda, Ramana Maharshi, Sai Baba etc come also, their message is tuned for t=
heir desa-kaala-paatra. Different times require different leelas, different=
 missions, different messages and different styles.

Unfortunately, Jaambav=
anta did not recognize when Lord Rama came back as Lord Krishna and even fo=
ught with him!

(5) While it is illogical to hold Thakur, Mother and Swamij=
i accountable for the beliefs of these people, I admire their blind faith. =
If it is opportunism, i.e. they just want to eat fish and use the icons of =
their organization as an excuse, that is bad. But, if it is genuine blind f=
aith that these icons were perfected beings and their words are never wrong=
, they will eventually make it. Opportunistic and egoistic faith is useless=
, but blind and complete faith accompanied by complete surrender is very po=
werful. People with such faith WILL find their way.

(6) The nearest path f=
rom Ujjain to Kashi does not go through Calcutta. But, if someone insists o=
n going through Calcutta, what can you do? Everyone takes a spiritual path =
based on one's conditioning. If we see a short path, we can only suggest it=
 to others but nor force them to take it.

Best regards,
Narasimha

D=
ear KK,
=C2=A0
Nice question. I was also thinking that.
=C2=A0
Few days bac=
k when I went to Calcutta, (where fish is the staple diet), one person told=
 me confidently that there is no harm in eating fish or meat because Swamij=
i used to do so, and in a Bengali book on the=C2=A0life of Sri Ramakrishna =
there is one example mentioned where a man came to ask him if should quite =
non veg food, and supposedly Ramakrishna said first leave "Kamini" and "Kan=
chana", then think of food. =C2=A0Also a similar examples was quoted to me =
from=C2=A0the life of Ma Sarada where - a certain book says - she advised a=
n ordinary devotee against leaving fish eating and rather just focus mind o=
n God.
=C2=A0
When I tried to reason with them that if these people were to=
 come back again on planet earth they may not recommend non veg eating - co=
nsidering the state of the world today - I=C2=A0 was catergorically told th=
ey are all Trikalagyas, so if there is something wrong in eating fish they =
would have told right then.=C2=A0 
=C2=A0
Then I tried to say that the exam=
ples maybe specific individual cases, to which I was told, "no", because ba=
sed on a whole plethora of such examples even today the monks of the Ramakr=
ishna Order in West Bengal eat and serve fish. This statement is a fact. I=
=C2=A0have had fish meals as prasad in many Ramakrishna Missions across=C2=
=A0West Bengal.=C2=A0So, I was told, the monks of the Ramakrishna Oder know=
 about teachings of Ramakrishna and Ma Sarada better than us ordrinary peop=
le. 
=C2=A0
I could make no further arguments and of course had a harrowing=
 time at home trying to convince my parents that I have quit non veg food. =

=C2=A0
A lot of Bengalis may not have been able to implement the basic tea=
chings of Ramakrishna in their lives, however they faithfully follow fish e=
ating as a sanction given by "Thakur" and "Sri Sri Ma" and "Swamiji".
=C2=

Sri Utpal (No Ji :) ),
=C2=
=A0
I tend to agree with you that all the members in your examples are high=
ly realized souls and they are probably knowing what they are doing.
=C2=A0=

In Bhagawadgita, Lord Sri Krishna tells that whatever the noble says, ordi=
nary mortals take them as gospel and whatever the Noble does, the ordinary =
simply follow (i donot know the verse but just remember the translation don=
e by sri ghantasala in telugu). Does that not be applicable to these spirit=

=C2=A0
I may be sounding very naive a=
nd ignorant but that is what i'm :)

Dear KK,

Correction in my earlier message =E2=80=93 =
It should read `Aghora, at the left hand of God'

A sincere suggestion from=
 me- No need to address me with `Ji' suffix. However, you are free to addre=
ss me as you feel like and I'll happily accept it hence forth.

I just came=
 across Vimalananda' s thought on Karma. He says (and Narasimha has many a =
times repeated) that Karma is only generated (Binding to one) when one self=
-identifies with it.
Although, it may seem easy to understand intellectuall=
y, the state is multiple times difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, it's an =
extremely important statement to answer our queries.

Important information=
 about Vimalananda which I came to know only yesterday is that he was a big=
 time smoker and there was not a single day passed in his life when he didn=
't do smoking except on the final day of his departure from physical body. =
He used to as well `chew Tobacco' frequently and occasionally ate meat. I g=
ave this information, because as you pointed out (and I also agree) that it=
 is an interesting coincidence of exact thoughts crossing our minds. Furthe=
r, please also note an important thing. The Aghori used to say very frequen=
tly to all his audience to do what he says and not try to do what he does.
=

Now whatever I wrote above seems sufficient to answer the questions you as=
ked. Let me put in my thoughts further (Mind you, these are thoughts of an =
unrealized person and the worth can be next to nothing). When we take examp=
le cases of Swami Vivekananda or Vimalananda or Sainbaba or any other such =
acknowledged spiritual giants, we tend to forget that they are all realized=
 souls who achieved very high level of spiritual realization. They are know=
er of everything or many things in the universe. Their individual ego is pe=
rfectly and completely tuned to universal ego. In short they *know* what th=
ey are doing. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis'. Relevant to our topic of discuss=
ion, I would say that if they ate meat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco or ki=
lled animals, they actually knew what they are doing. There would be surely=
 a specific purpose behind each and every action of theirs because as I sai=
d, they know complete background behind their each action and
 moreover the=
ir self identification is missing from the action and hence it is like Natu=
re operates through them to accomplish a special purpose without binding th=
em in any cause-effect chain.
Ramakrishna used to frequently say to all his=
 disciples that Naren is very different from others. He has a blazing spiri=
tual fire burning within him which can consume anything and everything. A f=
ood restriction does not bind him. He can eat anything without getting spir=
itually troubled but for others, a kind of food intake is extremely importa=
nt.
If Vivekananda ate meat during his stay in west, it'll surely have some=
 subtle purpose which is not possible for majority of us to comprehend unle=
ss explained by a person of that level. He might be removing `guilt' from t=
he sincere seekers amongst westerners so that he can be accepted by them as=
 one of them and then slowly try to eradicate their habits of meat eating a=
nd such other undesirable habits. It is also possible at the same time that=
 he is nullifying some balanced Rinanubandha with the `Animal' whose meat h=
e ate. It is also possible that he would have showered his unseen blessings=
 on the animal's soul by consuming its meat. It's possible that there were =
no apparent reasons for that but just a natural inconsequential act. We'll =
not know. Only Vivekananda, His Guru and Mother Nature know. By the way Viv=
ekananda saved a boy from drowning in a lake in USA while he was still in I=
ndia and did not even planned to go to USA. When the boy, after some
 years=
 actually met Swami in USA for the first time, swami immediately told him t=
o stay away from water and when he requested swami to accept him as his dis=
ciple, swami, after a moments thought told him that he is not his guru and =
his guru will come later and will give him Silver Cup as a gift. That man l=
ater became disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda and after 40 years, he was act=
ually given a gift of Silver-cup by Yogananda which literally fulfilled wha=
t swami Vivekananda `knew' before 40 years.

Swami Vivekananda was all know=
ing and most of us are NOT.

So moral of my whole writings is that it's unw=
ise as well as self deluding to take excuses of the unconventional habits o=
f Swami Vivekananda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vimalananda, Gajanana Maharaj, Swami =
Samarth, Trailang Swami and such masters and justify our completely self id=
entified and utterly selfish cruel/unjust actions.

<D=
IV>Dear KK,</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Nice question. I was also thinking=
 that.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Few days back when I went to Calcutta, =
(where fish is the staple diet), one person told me confidently that there =
is no harm in eating fish or meat because Swamiji used to do so, and in a B=
engali book on the life of Sri Ramakrishna there is one example mentio=
ned where a man came to ask him if should quite non veg food, and supposedl=
y Ramakrishna said first leave "Kamini" and "Kanchana", then think of food.=
  Also a similar examples was quoted to me from the life of Ma Sa=
rada where - a certain book says - she advised an ordinary devotee against =
leaving fish eating and rather just focus mind on God.</DIV>
<DIV> </D=
IV>
<DIV>When I tried to reason with them that if these people were to come=
 back again on planet earth they may not recommend non veg eating - conside=
ring the state of the world today - I  was catergorically told they ar=
e all Trikalagyas, so if there is something wrong in eating fish they would=
 have told right then.  </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Then I tried to =
say that the examples maybe specific individual cases, to which I was told,=
 "no", because based on a whole plethora of such examples even today the mo=
nks of the Ramakrishna Order in West Bengal eat and serve fish. This statem=
ent is a fact. I have had fish meals as prasad in many Ramakrishna Mis=
sions across West Bengal. So, I was told, the monks of the Ramakr=
ishna Oder know about teachings of Ramakrishna and Ma Sarada better than us=
 ordrinary people. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>I could make no further ar=
guments and of course had a harrowing time at home trying to convince my pa=
rents that I have quit non veg food. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>A lot of=
 Bengalis may not have been able to implement the basic teachings of Ramakr=
ishna in their lives, however they faithfully follow fish eating as a sanct=
ion given by "Thakur" and "Sri Sri Ma" and "Swamiji".</DIV>

<DIV>Dear KK,<BR><BR>Correction in my earlier =
message =E2=80=93 It should read `Aghora, at the left hand of God'<BR><BR>A=
 sincere suggestion from me- No need to address me with `Ji' suffix. Howeve=
r, you are free to address me as you feel like and I'll happily accept it h=
ence forth.<BR><BR>I just came across Vimalananda' s thought on Karma. He s=
ays (and Narasimha has many a times repeated) that Karma is only generated =
(Binding to one) when one self-identifies with it.<BR>Although, it may seem=
 easy to understand intellectually, the state is multiple times difficult t=
o achieve. Nevertheless, it's an extremely important statement to answer ou=
r queries.<BR><BR>Important information about Vimalananda which I came to k=
now only yesterday is that he was a big time smoker and there was not a sin=
gle day passed in his life when he didn't do smoking except on the final da=
y of his departure from physical body. He used to as well `chew Tobacco' fr=
equently and occasionally
 ate meat. I gave this information, because as yo=
u pointed out (and I also agree) that it is an interesting coincidence of e=
xact thoughts crossing our minds. Further, please also note an important th=
ing. The Aghori used to say very frequently to all his audience to do what =
he says and not try to do what he does.<BR><BR>Now whatever I wrote above s=
eems sufficient to answer the questions you asked. Let me put in my thought=
s further (Mind you, these are thoughts of an unrealized person and the wor=
th can be next to nothing). When we take example cases of Swami Vivekananda=
 or Vimalananda or Sainbaba or any other such acknowledged spiritual giants=
, we tend to forget that they are all realized souls who achieved very high=
 level of spiritual realization. They are knower of everything or many thin=
gs in the universe. Their individual ego is perfectly and completely tuned =
to universal ego. In short they *know* what they are doing. They are `Trika=
al gnyaanis'.
 Relevant to our topic of discussion, I would say that if the=
y ate meat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco or killed animals, they actually =
knew what they are doing. There would be surely a specific purpose behind e=
ach and every action of theirs because as I said, they know complete backgr=
ound behind their each action and moreover their self identification is mis=
sing from the action and hence it is like Nature operates through them to a=
ccomplish a special purpose without binding them in any cause-effect chain.=
<BR>Ramakrishna used to frequently say to all his disciples that Naren is v=
ery different from others. He has a blazing spiritual fire burning within h=
im which can consume anything and everything. A food restriction does not b=
ind him. He can eat anything without getting spiritually troubled but for o=
thers, a kind of food intake is extremely important.<BR>If Vivekananda ate =
meat during his stay in west, it'll surely have some subtle purpose which i=
s not
 possible for majority of us to comprehend unless explained by a pers=
on of that level. He might be removing `guilt' from the sincere seekers amo=
ngst westerners so that he can be accepted by them as one of them and then =
slowly try to eradicate their habits of meat eating and such other undesira=
ble habits. It is also possible at the same time that he is nullifying some=
 balanced Rinanubandha with the `Animal' whose meat he ate. It is also poss=
ible that he would have showered his unseen blessings on the animal's soul =
by consuming its meat. It's possible that there were no apparent reasons fo=
r that but just a natural inconsequential act. We'll not know. Only Vivekan=
anda, His Guru and Mother Nature know. By the way Vivekananda saved a boy f=
rom drowning in a lake in USA while he was still in India and did not even =
planned to go to USA. When the boy, after some years actually met Swami in =
USA for the first time, swami immediately told him to stay away from water
=
 and when he requested swami to accept him as his disciple, swami, after a =
moments thought told him that he is not his guru and his guru will come lat=
er and will give him Silver Cup as a gift. That man later became disciple o=
f Paramhansa Yogananda and after 40 years, he was actually given a gift of =
Silver-cup by Yogananda which literally fulfilled what swami Vivekananda `k=
new' before 40 years.<BR><BR>Swami Vivekananda was all knowing and most of =
us are NOT.<BR><BR>So moral of my whole writings is that it's unwise as wel=
l as self deluding to take excuses of the unconventional habits of Swami Vi=
vekananda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vimalananda, Gajanana Maharaj, Swami Samarth, T=
railang Swami and such masters and justify our completely self identified a=
nd utterly selfish cruel/unjust actions.<BR><BR>Best Regards,<BR><BR>Utpal =
