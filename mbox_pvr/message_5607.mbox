Sri Narasimha Garu,
I remember reading somewhere that "OM" is a beeja of g=
uru (not sure if it's a planet or internal or external) and if you add "om"=
 to any mantra you do you'll be protected by that guru from any fallacies i=
n your practices. Is it right?
ThanksKK

      Namaste,

 

Om is the nirguna beeja. It represents P=
araBrahma. Other beejas like those in navarna mantra are saguna beejas and =
they represent combinations of specific qualities. Adding Om at the beginni=
ng of a mantra is like thinking of ParaBrahma and then thinking of a specif=
ic deity or form in relation to ParaBrahma. In tradition, Om is invariably =
added at the beginning of every mantra, if it is not already there.

 

Whe=
n you think of a specific form such as Mahakali or Sri Rama or Narasimha or=
 Saraswati or Tara or Dakshinamurthy etc, it is possible to see them as for=
ms representing certain qualities or as forms emanating from ParaBrahma and=
 representing certain qualities. Thinking of ParaBrahma will keep the notio=
n that "all is Brahman", which is the corner stone of Self-knowledge, as a =
part of one's sadhana.

 

Some people actually consider it "risky" to do m=
antras starting with other beejas and add Om. This is basically like making=
 Self-knowledge the fundamental goal of sadhana and remembering it always, =
so that you do not risk getting swayed by other goals (like specific abilit=
ies, siddhis etc).

 

As for navarna mantra, one can do it with or without=
 Om. Both are fine. But do ponder on the above and do what you find appropr=
iate. Both are meaningful and both affect one's consciousness positively.

Best regards,

Narasimha
