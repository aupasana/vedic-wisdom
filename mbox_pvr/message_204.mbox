Namaste,

Sri Chakra pooja is not something I perform.

However, there are many nice books. One of the best I have seen is by Sri 
Chaitanyananda and called "Sri Vidya Pooja Vidhi". It is in Tamil, English 
and Hindi. It is a very elaborate book on the worship of Sri Chakra. It is 
written by the gentleman who runs Rajarajeswari peetham at Rush (near 
Rochester), New York. It is a fantastic temple (www.srividya.org). His 
god-brother Sri Karunamaya Baba used to live in the Boston area (where I 
live) and teach Sri chakra pooja to people in this area (www.srimeru.org). 
Now he is the pontiff of a religious order in Devipuram (near Visakhapatnam, 
AP, India). Both of them belong to this religious order (www.devipuram.com). 
Sri Karunamaya Baba conducts seminars in India and US and teaches Sri Chakra 
pooja. This book gives the method used by their religious order and lineage.

Best regards,
Narasimha
