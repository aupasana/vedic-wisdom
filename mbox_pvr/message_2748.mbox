Namaste,
 
This is excellent - your terminology seems to be evolving and getting refined now. At one stage, you said "Ahamkara isn't the dominant cause of I-ness in Astral/Causal bodies", while I was saying ahamkara=I-ness. Now, you wrote:
 
>   PHYSICAL I-NESS (AHAMKARA)  = ASMITA   = Physical Egotism
>   ASTRAL I-NESS   (AHAMKARA)  = MANAS    = Astral attachments
>   CAUSAL I-NESS   (AHAMKARA)  = CHITTA   = Causal Perceptions
 
So you are acknowledging that I-ness and ahamkara are synonyms and referring to ahamkara at astral and causal planes. It is good that you are slowly converging!
 
*        *        *
 
I did not want to divert from the upanishadic terminology of 19 ideas of individualized consciousness. So I stuck to the term ahamkaara and ignored your references to Patanjali. Now that there is some convergence on "ahamkaara", let me address "asmita" mentioned in Patanjali yoga sutras.
 
> identification of the seer with the instrument of
> seeing i.e. Physical senses.
 
You are assuming that physical senses or physical body is the only instrument of seeing (or experiencing).
 
However, mind can see, hear, feel and experience things even when it is not working with a physical body and physical senses. For example, one's mind may "see" something in a dream without the physical eyes seeing anything.
 
Also, a yogi in deep meditation may see, hear, feel or experience something without the involvement of eyes, ears and other physical senses.
 
If such a yogi identifies with the instrument of that experience, i.e. the mind, that too is asmita as per Patanjali's yoga sutra that you quoted. Just as I had an issue earlier with your limiting of ahamkaara to physical body, I also have an issue with your limiting of asmita to physical body.
 
BTW, identification with physical body *as well as* identification with mind block one from yoga (communion) with true Self. Both are due to ahamkaara as defined by upanishads. Both are due to asmita as defined by Patanjali.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

While they will still have the idea of "Asmita" in their causal bodies, but they will always be repelled by the grosser-vibrations of Sensual experiences in Physical Bodies/Cosmos, and hence would not incur any Physical Karma due to "Asmita".

When ahamkaara binds more to one layer, one looks at oneself primarily from the perspective of that layer. When ahamkaara does not bind to anything at all, one is in nirvikalpa samadhi, i.e. established in Brahman. Ahamkaara or I-ness is a fundamental property of an individualized consciousness and remains as long as there is some individualization.

When scriptures defined the 19 proerties of individualized consciousness, they only defined one ahamkaara apart from manas, chitta etc and did not define "ahamkaara of manas" and "ahamkaara of chitta" etc.

The conditions of the birth and inbetween period depends both on his inherent samaskaras as well the karmic repurcussion. It not, never, entirely once choice. It a mix and match between what one wants and what one deserves. IN all cases, to be able to retain the samskara Ahamakara is needed. Therefore, Ahamkara exists even in beyond the death for a normal human being. Therewfore, Ahamkara is present in the astral/casual plane as well.

If someone says "so and so person is a terrible person", one may feel offended or if someone says "so and so person is a great person", one may feel elated. One's ahamkara or I-ness is identifying with the criticism or praise, even though nothing is being done to the physical body and only a name is being used. When somebody calls one by name from distance (as opposed to patting on the physical body and calling), one's consciousness may still think "I am being called" and one may turn towards the caller. As in these examples, one's I-ness does of course bind itself to more than a body.

In dreams, one may see oneself as a different body or may not even "see" onself, but still one may have the sense that so and so thing is happening to "me". So, even when the mind is drawn away from the physical body, there is still a notion of "I am this" (I-ness) in a dream. That is ahamkara or I-ness or ego principle.

For example, buddhi (intellectual/ discriminating mind) judges various past experiences, interacts with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tells it what to do. Then manas interacts with karmendriyas (organs of action) and makes them do various things. My buddhi determined what to write and my manas told my hands to type this and I ended up typing.

The sense of I-ness, the memories and conditioning, the logical mind, the sensory-motor mind, karmendriyas etc are all different parts of individualized consciousness and they play different roles while interacting with each other in different ways. Some of those interactions may be deemed to be controls.

Even after a Soul is freed of the three bodies, the individuality of the Soul Atom is not destroyed (Resurrection implies that), while it has already given up the idea of Ahamkara including all other ideas.
> > > > > 
> > > > > Individuality of a causal-bodied being is not due to the idea of Ahamkara because "What exists as a part cannot be the whole". Thus, the idea of Ahamkara, being one of the 35 ideas of the Causal-body, doesn't account for neither controls the rest of the 34 ideas. Each idea is independent of another, without requiring another idea to act upon it - otherwise your buddhi would always interfere with the functioning of Mind or Ahamkara or the 5 functions of life-forces and so on.

Thus, each is independent of the application of the sense of I-ness derived from Ahamkara. Manas and Buddhi being two of the Causal-ideas, their functioning as well as existence is not "controlled" nor "derived" in any way by the idea of Ahamkara. It is very clear when we see those with sharpest Buddhi or Sharpest Mind still carrying Heaviest Ahamkara, because they didn't work upon that particular idea.

Well, as most Physical-bodied beings cannot see through the Astral/causal cosmoses, it doesn't apply in the same way to the finer Astral and Causal-bodied beings who can always pierce the veil of Maya and see the human activities. Thus, what is "the very basis" of the entire individualized consciousness for a physical-bodied (unenlightened) being is not the same as for an astral/causal bodied being.

Devatas are, however, Astral/Causal- bodied beings, so they would attempt to influence the Manas (Spirit-Possession) of the sense-bound worshipper. Pretas on the other hand, would attempt to possess ones' physical body as well as act out their Ahamkara.

> > > > > 
> > > > > Now, as we all know that Physical body expires as a whole, not just one or two of the 16 elements comprising it go away at a time, Astral and Causal bodies are also cast off as a whole in the corresponding cosmic consciousness - instead of different constituent ideas slipping out of it at different times. Chitta being the staging idea for all other modifications, can be termed as the last to go, when the causal body is finally dropped - hence I wrote as rising above Chitta.

However, being constituted of Satwa Guna, it doesn't have any inherent ability to act upon (Rajas) those impressions, just like a container containing an inflammable liquid doesn't automatically burn it down. Sadhana is required for That.
> > > > > The Samskaras stored by Chitta, including those of Nidra, Smriti, Vikalpa, Viparyaya, Pramana, correspond to the Tamo Guna, while the Chitta itself is Satva Guna - hence the "Satvic - Tamas" represents the SuperEther tattwa (refer my previous mail). The all-perceiving Satvic Chitta doesn't get conditioned by the Tamo-guni Samskaras it stores.
> > > > > Once the Chitta calms down, cleared of all residual impressions, only Satva Guna remains, the intuition becomes coherent and the Soul reflects on itself as distinct from Satva Guna of Prakriti (Chitta), thus realizing its own nature as Brahman.

Similarly, Causal bodied beings can use thought to sense everything.

Read autobiography of a Yogi (chapter 43) where Sri Yukteswar illustrates that only those beings who cannot be tempted to go back to the pleasing to the eye Astral cosmos are permitted to stay permanently in the Causal cosmos. Pleasing to the eye implies Sense-consciousness which is associated with Manas.
