Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Some queries on meanings of words in homa manual


Namaste Narasimhaji and others


There are a few words in the homa manual which I cannot understand.
Kindly tell me the meanings of the folowing:

1)sambh�ta�

2) �aktihasta�

3) s�mag�n�� k�p�kar�ya

4) v���e� kartre

5) asm�dagne�

6) asm�nm�rte�ca

These are from the Kuja homa manual.

-Regards
 Rajarshi
