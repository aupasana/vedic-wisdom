Dear Sanjay,
 
Yes, the right deity who takes one far changes from from per=
son to person. Horoscope can give clues, but our understanding may or may n=
ot be perfect always. For example, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa's chart has Sun =
(Raama/Maatangi in general opinion) in 12th from Atma Karaka in navamsa and=
 Jupiter (Vaamana/Taaraa) owns it. A highly learned astrologer once argued =
with me publicly that Lord Rama and Taaraa were Ramakrishna Paramahamsa's i=
shta devatas and not Kaali and tried to justify that. Well, if Ramakrishna =
Paramahamsa comes to you and the thumb rules you use do not show Kaali as i=
shta devata for him, the rules you are using have something missing.
 
Thus=
, horoscopic thumb rules are not reliable. However, the vibrations you feel=
 when chanting different mantras and visiting different temples can be usef=
ul clues. The word of a sadguru is the best way to know one's ishta devata.=
 Second best is internal guidance. Horscope comes only after that.
 
Irresp=
ective of ishta devata, I will recommend Mahaganapathi homam for anybody fo=
r a while. After Ganapathi gives an initial clearance and push, the path wi=
ll become clear by itself and clear guidance will come, from either inside =
our outside.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

  De=
ar Narasimhaji 

  Namaste,

  Thanks for the detailed explanation. It real=
ly helps and I really appreciate your time & patience in explaining it so b=
eautifully for a layman.

  One followup question:

  Regarding Homam - wil=
l it not depend on my chart? As per my chart (26/2/73, 17:07, 87E19,23N29, =
Leo Lagna) and my brief study of VRA/CoVA, My Isht devta will be Shiva(Sun)=
, Palan devta is Samba siva (have not heard much about him) and Guru Devta =
is Skanada. 

  Further, As per inclination, I do feel great energy in SOME=
 of shiva and ganesh temples(from last 3 years). It's a difficult to descri=
be feeling - it's as if a spiritual energy/vibration is surrounding me. Rec=
ently, I went to a shani( w/Hanuman & Ganesha) temple, and it also seemed t=
o have good vibration to me. How do I reconcile these facts on choosing the=
 homam? Is it just the play of my mind to be ignored , or divine interventi=
on to be interpreted. 
  Or 
  if Mahaganapathi Homam is THE starting point=
 before we go ahead with any effort at reconciliation.

  Thanks & Regards

    Namaste,

    (a) Correct. It i=
s fine to work hard like a honeybee, be engrossed in material life and feel=
 many happinesses and sadnesses of life. The only thing missed out is self-=
realization and moksha.

    (b) Not exactly. Spiritual progress does not m=
ean shunning material things. Some people leave wife, children, house, car =
etc and live in forest, in an attempt to get control over the mind and remo=
ve the attachment to and dependency on those things. However, it is not nec=
essary. One can remove the dependency on all things that surround one, even=
 as one remains in their middle! Staying away from something is neither nec=
essary nor sufficient to overcome attachment. What things and people are ar=
ound you and what actions you engage in are not the problem that blocks you=
 from moksha. It is how you look at them and with what frame of mind you en=
gage in the actions that are the blockages. So the problem is not the mater=
ial world around you, but your own mind that is the problem. Detachment doe=
s not mean not loving or not engaging in actions. Detachment means loving b=
ut without expectations and engaging in actions but without expectations.

=
    If you give love and do not expect anything in return, if you put in yo=
ur best effort towards what you see as your dharma for people around you an=
d do not worry about things that go wrong, if you focus on the present and =
engage in the best possible actions without too much of worry or anxiety ab=
out past or future, can there be anything more effective or efficient than =
that?

    If one is like a drop of water on a lotus leaf and engages in ac=
tions without attachment, one is not necessarily a failure materially. Such=
 a person will do everything a person with deep attachments does, but only =
better! I say better, because a detached person does not waste time worryin=
g about things out of one's hand or things that went wrong. A detached pers=
on always focuses on the best action to engage in right now and does it.

 =
   Let me put this in one sentence: Attachment does not make you more effec=
tive or efficient. In fact, if anything, attachment makes you less effectiv=
e and efficient. If you are detached, you will give unconditionally and eng=
age in actions without any energy being dispersed on worrying over things o=
ut of your control. Normal people waste a lot of their time, energy and emo=
tional space, worrying about things they cannot control. A detached person =
does what is in one's control perfectly and accepts the result whole-hearte=
dly.

    (c) If you are a jeevanmukta, you will do everything you see as y=
our dharma, but only better. You will not feel happy or sad or jealous and =
angry etc. Your mind will be in a stable, peaceful and blissful state alway=
s. It is worth it. You are not getting out of anything, but putting in the =
best effort.

    (e) Yes, do not think of emancipation or liberation. Thin=
k one small step at a time. Think of getting some physical and mental disci=
pline. Think of some minor control over mind. Thinking overcoming minor wea=
knesses. Start slowly.

    (f) There are many ways. The specific way using=
 which many people will benefit in the next few centuries and the specific =
way which I am here to teach is "homam" or fire ritual. When you are with a=
 person, the physical vibrations made by the person's lips can be heard phy=
sically by your ears. Similarly, the vibrations made by his subtle body and=
 mind can be "heard" by your subtle body and mind. That is why we feel plea=
sant when we are with great saints and uneasy in some companies. The vibrat=
ions produced by the subtle and causal bodies of people around us do have a=
n impact on us. Fire is one powerful object which has very pleasant, powerf=
ul and cleansing vibrations at the subtle and causal levels. Being next to =
fire of a reasonable size is like being with a great yogi.

    If one does=
 a 20-40 min Mahaganapathi homam everyday for 2-3 years, things will automa=
tically start to fall in place.

    The problem you are seeking is your mi=
nd. The solution is also in your mind. You use your mind to train mind to l=
et go of its weaknesses and attachments one by one.

      Dear Narasimha,

      Very good =
article/discussion..Thanks for sharing it.

      If I can, Let me also ask=
 some basic questions. (I am very new to all this. Search for some answers =
has brought me to this forum.) 

      a) Why Madhukaitam is  so bad/evil? =
Is it not that the world is being sustained by people keeping their head do=
wn and doing the routine work? Do we not please the God by keeping our head=
 down and playing the role assigned to us ? An obvious answer comes to mind=
 is that it will keep us away from emancipation and/self-actualization. Cor=
rect/Incorrect? 

      b) So,  Is spirituality and materialism two poles a=
part (and twain shall never meet..). Say I wd like to reach the heights of =
professional success in my career, Am I doomed not to become a good spiritu=
alist (???)? or, If I want to become self-actualized by 2025, does it mean =
I should stop planning to climb the professional ladder? I do understand ab=
out "Limited Bandwidth" issue - but, then I also read about King Janak. Can=
 I combine these two - if yes, how?

      c) Getting even more confused no=
w,  Why do we say that emancipation is our spiritual goal. If GOD created u=
s, and put us on this stage - should our goal not be to play the role dutif=
ully, which God wants us to play. By seeking for emancipation, are we tryin=
g to get off the stage and trying to escape the role assigned to us. Are we=
 not contradicting the God's scheme of things by trying to get out of the s=
cheme? 

      d) Or, Is it part of God's scheme to put us in this "maya" f=
irst and then ask us to get out of the "maya"? Why will he do so? I am sure=
 he will not be playing "rats in the maze" game. Then, why??

      e) Some=
times, I also think that all these above questions are meaningless. I look =
at my pre-school kid and the way she has put her faith in her teacher. She =
is not worrying about her profession or phd thesis right now. Similarly, pr=
obably, Emancipation/Merger in Cosmic soul etc are problems that we should =
not be thinking at the begining of our spiritual journey - just look to lea=
rn/experience more till we are ready (for what?)

      f) Then, what do we=
 mean by spiritual journey? where/how do we start? I thought about doing ho=
mam/reciting mantra - but is that the right way? or there is another way. P=
robably, there are many ways - then how do I choose my way? An "user guide"=
 or " spirituality for dummies" book  would have been useful. Do we have on=
e?

      I will appreciate if you can take some time out to guide me here.=
 In fact, probably, I donot even have the right question right now - forget=
 about articulating them well and seeking the answer (I am seeking the prob=
lem :))

     The non-dual Aatman or Brahman is the original source of everything. B=

      Please see the "many f=

      The duality is so vast and yet non-duali=

the last part of the mail mentioned above. It is an analogy worth getting i=

      There is no causal relationship between the tw=

They just happen together. Neither causes the other.

      Rishis are the =

      Our ego does not leave us even in sadhana.=
 Sometimes, one's belief that one's guru is the best guru or the god one pr=
ays to is the supreme one is rooted in one'e ego and one's need to be the b=
est and be associated with the best. Just contemplate if that is the case a=
nd if it is, try to root out such thinking.

      Having said that, do loo=
k at the god you pray to as the supreme and try to reach the supreme throug=
h him/her by surrendering to him/her. If you take a low level manifestation=
 of that deity, then rishis may indeed be beyond him/her as Vimalananda sai=
d. But, if you take the highest manifestation of the deity, as the supreme =
cosmic being, then rishis are his playmates and neither above nor below.

     *        *        *

      If you take a company, there may be a chair=
man who may be the highest authority. But, it may be a ceremonial role and =
some may consider CEO to be higher while some may consider the chairman to =
be higher. Why bother about who is higher? In a company does well, they bot=

      The hierarchy is irrelevant to one who is=
 a clerk at the company. Just follow the order of your boss (guru) instead =
of wondering whether chairman calls the shots or CEO.

              I have a question. Though it will =
probably sound stupid to a learned man like you, but I just could not get a=
 convincing answer to it, so thought of putting this question in this forum=
.

              You mentioned that a senior Maharishi is doing this. In th=
e books of Vimalananda he says Naths, Munis and Rishis are higher beings, e=
ven higher than deities.

              What confuses me is that, what can =
be higher than a deity? For example Goddes Durga is the supreme mother of a=
ll worlds, then how can a Rishi or any being be higher than Her? Or lord Sh=
iva or Narayana?

              I mean is it the Rishi who is acting our th=
e Mother's instructions or is it She who is creating the environment for th=
e Rishi's wish to come true? Which one came first?

              It gets c=
onfusing-:(. 

              As a devotee it is natural and simple to belie=
ve that the God I pray to is the Ultimate Supreme authority, but when I hea=
r that Rishis are even beyond this, then doubt creeps in, is the deity ther=
efore not as supreme as is made out to be?

              Sorry if these qu=
estions seem childish, but I really get confused thinking about this.

                Namaste,

                Aurobind=
o need not be talking about a single "savior" the way people may imagine. A=
lso, he need not be talking about somebody "connected to" his ashram. Moreo=
ver, when it comes to great lineages, there are connections between all. Fo=
r example, Aurobindo used to visit the house of Sister Nivedita, the foremo=
st disciple of Swami Vivekananda and knew her well when he still lived in C=
alcutta. He had a vision in his prison cell of Swami Vivekananda, just a fe=
w years after his death, in which he imparted Aurobindo some key knowledge.=
 Paramahamsa Yogananda grew up in Calcutta and learnt Sanskrit from M, who =
was a sishya of Ramakrishna and wrote the gospel of Ramakrishna. Trilinga S=
wami sent a tantra teacher to Ramakrishna to expand his knowledge. Trilinga=
 Swami knew Lahiri mahashaya and admired him. And so on.

                C=
oming back to the main point, the supermind established in the field of ear=
th that was referred to by Aurobindo can simply be a maharshi paying some a=
ttention to matters on earth. A maharshi absorbed in the divine in one of t=
he higher planes of consciousness can accomplish huge changes on earth by t=
he mere power of his thought. If there is a divine play to make some positi=
ve changes on earth and a maharshi takes part in the play, he may focus a s=
mall part of his supermind on the affairs of earth and direct a few importa=
nt souls to do some key work. Some important souls (deities, rishis or yogi=
s etc) may send their amshas (partial essence) to be born on earth to fulfi=
l different parts of a divine play.

                You may then see sever=
al (not just one) elevated beings, enlightened beings and realized beings b=
orn on earth to bring clarity in different aspects of spiritual knowledge. =
Each of them will get specific internal/external guidance from the divine, =
based on what their part in the play is.

                *        *       =
 *

                The "Asura of Falsehood" that Aurobindo alluded to is a=
ll around us. At the subtlest level, he manifests as false ego in pretty mu=
ch everybody. At the grossest level, he manifests as blatant lies, wrong pr=
opaganda etc.

                One should not tolerate this Asura (demon) a=
nd fight hard. However, one should not hate this Asura or those afflicted b=
y him. When we encounter lies, we should fight and stand for truth but not =
hate the liar at the same time. There is nothing that needs to be hated in =
this world. One should learn to do the job assigned to one by Nature withou=
t attraction or repulsion to anything or anybody and with unconditional lov=
e (i.e. no expectations of a return) to all.

                > This was a =
very interesting read and matches what Narasimhaji
                > says a=
bout changes coming in the world.

                I know very little. But =
I was told that an age that is somewhat like the bygone ages will be establ=
ished on earth for a few hundred years in the coming decades. The reason th=
e Divine Mother appeared before Manish and asked him to spread simple homam=
 procedures in the world was to prepare the grounds for that. Manish also t=
old me that all this is the play of a senior maharshi.

                        Hi, Some time back I saw  similar articl=

Beings?
                         
                         Personally, I be=
lieve it was pointing towards Mother Meera. She is a Enlightened person and=
 has helped thousands who go to her by removing some of their karmic cords.=
 Although she now lives in Germany but in her younger days she was connecte=
d to Aurobindo;s ashram.

     I found an interesting article based on Sri Aurobindo's writing. I am =
posting it here for anyone interested.

                                Nea=
r the beginning of the 20th century the great Indian freedom fighter and yo=
gi-sage, Sri Aurobindo, began to express a truth which had not been express=
ed before. In his high states of divine union he saw that the time had come=
 for a new stage in the evolution of mankind. He saw that the divine was to=
 manifest right here on Earth and that the time for this divine emergence i=
nto Earth life was now. He spoke of heaven descending to Earth, even as Ear=
th experienced a breakdown due to the intrinsic resistance held within her =
material body towards this =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD
                     =
           =EF=BF=BD
                                Sri Aurobindo was join=
ed in Pondicherry, India, by a French mystic, Mirra Alfassa, who later beca=
me known as the Mother. Together they embarked on a journey of intensive ce=
llular transformation that is very relevant to the colossal uncertainties w=
e face today.
                                =EF=BF=BD
                   =
             Sri Aurobindo saw that the divine force permeates all matter, =
and that all matter therefore has a force of consciousness. The process of =
the divine spirit descending down into matter is called involution. The pro=
cess by which the divine ascends back upwards out of matter is called evolu=
tion. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a stage where these =
two events are occurring simultaneously, and in his inner visions, he fores=
aw that we would soon be experiencing a descent of what he called =EF=BF=BD=
supramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=BD that would entirely change =
everything on Earth.
                                =EF=BF=BD
            =
                    Man=EF=BF=BDs greatness is not in what he is, says Sri =
Aurobindo, but in what he makes possible. An immortal soul is somewhere wit=
hin him, even if seldom active in most people, while an eternal spirit over=
shadows him, even if obstructed from descent by the hard lid of his constru=
cted personality. There is a great divine plan in motion, even if the evide=
nce of the outer senses seems to contradict it.

                          =
      Sri Aurobindo recognized that humankind is going through an evolution=
ary crisis. A stage has been reached in which the human mind has made treme=
ndous strides on the one hand, but is left hopelessly inadequate to prevent=
 its own extinction as a species. Meanwhile, as the Mother testified before=
 her death in 1973, a consciousness higher than the human rational mind, wh=
at may be termed the Supermind, has recently been established in the fields=
 of the Earth, and is active there. Our task now is to bring it down into c=
ellular consciousness.

                                Evolution took a gr=
eat leap forward with the origins of Life, and later with the emergence of =
Mind. We are now at the threshold of another leap forward, even more moment=
ous, as we prepare for the emergence of the Supermind. Sri Aurobindo speaks=
 about four stages of human evolution, which we will soon be starting to ex=
perience concurrently upon Earth. The first is =EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=
=BD our current species, a rational being possessing an individualized soul=
, but largely obstructed from contacting and merging with it.
             =
                   =EF=BF=BD
                                Next is the =
=EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a species that is spontaneous- ly coming to =
birth under the influence of an ever-expanding supramental field, a being t=
hat is largely able to merge and live from soul-consciousness rather than m=
ind-consciousness. 

                                Thirdly is the =EF=BF=
=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still inhabit a dense physical body, but will=
 be in possession of the Mind of Light, which is supramental consciousness =
that has begun to merge with cellular consciousness. 

                    =
            Finally, our ultimate goal as a species is the =EF=BF=BDSuprame=
ntal Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity incarnated fully within the subtle realms of =
matter. This will be a race of what we could call =EF=BF=BDDescended Master=
s.=EF=BF=BD In this species, the unity of matter and spirit would be fully =
realized upon Earth.

                                The great work of Sri=
 Aurobindo and the Mother was in bringing supramental consciousness down in=
to the cellular consciousness of their own bodies. Since this is a unified =
consciousness, this meant that the supramental consciousness was simultaneo=
usly being brought into the consciousness fields of the Earth, awaiting the=
 moment when it would flower into its full manifestation in collective matt=
er.
                                Whenever there is a =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=
=BF=BD there is corresponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo and the Mother spea=
k of their experience with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD essentially a=
nti-divine forces, at work in the world today. There is the Asura of Darkne=
ss, the Asura of Suffering, The Asura of Falsehood, and the Asura of Death.=
 These are the forces that are so outwardly apparent, and which seem to be =
in control of current global events. According to them the Asura of Darknes=
s (Lucifer?) has gone through a transformation recently, and the Asura of S=
uffering has returned to Source, and so only the latter two still remain to=
 wreak havoc on Earth. Interestingly, they spoke of the Asura of Falsehood =
=EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during World War II, and of the=
ir own intensive inner work in countering his influence. It would not be di=
fficult to see how this same Asura may be influencing other world leaders i=
n the current political sphere.

                                With the d=
escent of this new vibratory consciousness all our old obsolete human struc=
tures will be demolished. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that although t=
he changes will be enormous they would not be necessarily catastrophic. The=
 power of Truth automatically erases Falsehood, and our world for the most =
part consists of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, he maintained, carried a =
power of harmonization which could overcome this resistance by means other =
than dramatic struggle and violence. The Asuras will eventually be absorbed=
 into their original emanations of Light, Life, Beauty, and Truth. It may b=
e interesting to speculate, with all the violence in the world today, the d=
estruction we might have experienced if not for this power of harmonization=
!

                                When does all this happen? Sri Aurobindo=
 and the Mother believed that the world stage was set for this quantum desc=
ent, and that it was quite imminent. The Mother said in 1968 that the supra=
mental transformation was a certainty now, and that it would come about wit=
h a minimum of destruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough this minimum is still conside=
rable.=EF=BF=BD She said that the year 2000 would be a turning point.

  Isht devta will be Shiva(Su=

  <DIV>Further, As per inclination, I do feel great energy in SOME=
 of shiva and 
  ganesh temples(from last 3 years). It's a difficult to des=
cribe feeling 
  - it's as if a spiritual energy/vibration is surround=
ing 
  me. Recently, I went to a shani( w/Hanuman & 
  G=
anesha) temple, and it also seemed to have good vibration to me. How d=
o 
  I reconcile these facts on choosing the homam? Is it just the play of =
my mind 
  to be ignored , or divine intervention to be interpreted.&n=

ard" by your subtle body and mind. That is why we 
    feel pleasant when w=
e are with great saints and uneasy in some companies. 
    The vibrations p=
roduced by the subtle and causal bodies of people around us 
    do have an=
 impact on us. Fire is one powerful object which has very 
    pleasant, po=
werful and cleansing vibrations at the subtle and causal levels. 
    Being=
 next to fire of a reasonable size is like being with a great 
    yogi.</F=

      <DIV>Dear Narasimha,=
</DIV>
      <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
      <DI=
V>Very good article/discussion..Thanks for sharing it.</DIV>
      <DIV><FO=
NT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
      <DIV>If I can, Let me al=
so ask some basic questions. (I am very new to all 
      this. Search for =
some answers has brought me to this forum.) </DIV>
      <DIV><FONT face=3D=
Arial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
      <DIV>a) Why Madhukaitam is  s=
o bad/evil? Is it not that the world is 
      being sustained by people ke=
eping their head down and doing the routine 
      work? Do we not please t=
he God by keeping our head down and playing the 
      role assigned to us =
? An obvious answer comes to mind is that it will keep 
      us away from =
emancipation and/self-actualization. Correct/Incorrect? 
</DIV>
      <DIV>=
<FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
      <DIV>b) So,  Is =
spirituality and materialism two poles apart (and 
      twain shall never =
meet..). Say I wd like to reach the heights of 
      professional success =
in my career, Am I doomed not to become a good 
      spiritualist (???)? o=
r, If I want to become self-actualized by 2025, does 
      it mean I shoul=
d stop planning to climb the professional ladder? I do 
      understand ab=
out "Limited Bandwidth" issue - but, then I also read about 
      King Jan=
ak. Can I combine these two - if yes, how?</DIV>
      <DIV><FONT face=3DAr=
ial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
      <DIV>
      <DIV>c) Getting even mor=
e confused now,  Why do we say that 
      emancipation is our sp=
iritual goal. If GOD created us, and put us on 
      this stage - should o=
ur goal not be to play the role dutifully, which God 
      wants us to pla=
y. By seeking for emancipation, are we trying to get off 
      the stage a=
nd trying to escape the role assigned to us. Are we not 
      contradictin=
g the God's scheme of things by trying to get out of the 
      scheme? </D=
IV>
      <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
      <DIV>d=
) Or, Is it part of God's scheme to put us in this "maya" first and 
      =
then ask us to get out of the "maya"? Why will he do so? I am sure he will =

      not be playing "rats in the maze" game. Then, why??</DIV>
     =
 <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
      <DIV>e) Sometim=
es, I also think that all these above questions are 
      meaningless. I l=
ook at my pre-school kid and the way she has put her faith 
      in her te=
acher. She is not worrying about her profession or phd thesis 
      right =
now. Similarly, probably, Emancipation/Merger in Cosmic soul 
      et=
c are problems that we should not be thinking at the begining of our 
     =
 spiritual journey - just look to learn/experience more till we are ready 
=
      (for what?)</DIV>
      <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> =
;</DIV>
      <DIV>f) Then, what do we mean by spiritual journey? where/how=
 do we start? 
      I thought about doing homam/reciting mantra - but is t=
hat the right way? 
      or there is another way. Probably, there are many=
 ways - then how do I 
      choose my way? An "user guide" or " spirituali=
ty for dummies" book  
      would have been useful. Do we have one?</=
DIV>
      <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
      <DIV>=
I will appreciate if you can take some time out to guide me here. In 
     =
 fact, probably, I donot even have the right question right now - forget 
 =
     about articulating them well and seeking the answer (I am seeking the =

      problem :))</DIV>

                prison cell of Swami Vivekan=
anda, just a few years after 
                his death, in which he i=
