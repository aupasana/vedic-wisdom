Namaste Rajarshi,

Swami Brahmananda was not a normal soul. Thakur said he was one of Lord 
Krishna's eternal playmates.

Words and actions of great masters like Swami Brahmananada are not always 
easy to understand. He may have had some subtle motivations when he said 
that.

There are many people who are prone to pride and do not realize god despite 
abstinence and other wonderful ascetic practices. They let those ascetic 
practices fill them with pride and never reach the final goal. If he wanted 
to subtly remind such people the final goal and remove the mental focus on 
intermediate steps, he may say something like that.

If he wanted someone to ponder over whether someone else can give one god or 
one has to do sadhana and individual effort, then also he may something like 
that.

If he wanted to dismiss the notion that his blessings would remove lust from 
people, with hidden and subtle sircasm that he was quite capable of, then 
also he may have said that. It is subtler than sircastically saying "while 
we are at it, why not ask for god? I may as well grant you god". He may have 
wanted to make the person understand the need of individual effort as 
opposed to getting something (say, brahmacharya) with his blessings.

*        *        *

Brahmacharya and other practices give higher and higher control over self. 
When the control over self is *perfect*, one may find god.

Another person may find god due to the grace of a guru and brahmacharya and 
other practices may come to one in a perfect form *along with* that. That is 
also possible. It is not necessary to engage in a certain practice for a 
long duration to realize god. If one is already very pure from all previous 
life efforts and the impurities of this life exist only on the surface, it 
may be possible for a sadguru to free such a person in a moment and make him 
realize god.

However, one should start climbing the mountain when there is no certainty 
that one will suddenly disappear at the base and find oneself on the peak in 
a blessed moment, though that is possible!

*        *        *

When Swami Brahmananda was doing several penances in Vrindavan, Vijaykrishna 
Goswami, who had know him for a long time in Calcutta, asked "The Master 
gave you all that is covetable in spiritual life: visions and samadhi. Why 
then do you still practise so much austerity?" Brahmananda humbly answered: 
"The experiences and visions I got by his grace, I am now trying to attain 
as my permanent possession."

Despite visions of gods and samadhi, he know that his realization was not 
perfect and there was more to be perfected!

Observing his hardship, rigorous disciplines, and long meditation and 
prayer, Swami Subodhananda once told him "The Master looked upon you as his 
son. You are the veritable son of the Lord. It does not befit you to sit 
like a beggar seeking his grace." Brahmananda replied: "What you say, 
brother, is true. The Master loved us so dearly that he gave us everything 
he had to give. Still we have not attained peace. This shows that it now 
lies with us to do the rest for the fulfillment of life's objective. Uddhava 
was Krishna's dear friend, you Krishna said to him: 'If you want to properly 
realize any spiritual truth, you must go to some solitary place and practise 
austerity. I can grant you some miraculous visions, if you like. But that 
won't be enough. It is much greater to concentrate and meditate on Him.' 
Indeed, without meditation and contemplation none can know anything about 
God."

Some may climb a small hill, think it is Mt Everest and start calling 
themselves realized. But the disciples of Ramakrishna like Swami Brahmananda 
were different.

In order to understand the motivation behind specific words, you have to 
understand him better.

*        *        *

Most sishyas of Ramakrishna did not marry. Some married, but never had 
sexual relations with wives (e.g. Swami Yogananda, who married forcefully, 
and Swami Shivananda). Swami Brahmananda was one who not only married but 
had a child too! He was at one stage troubled by lust and found it very 
difficult to conquer it. Thakur placed his hand on his heart and chanted a 
mantra. Swami Brahmananda revealed that he never felt lust after that.

Best regards,
Narasimha
