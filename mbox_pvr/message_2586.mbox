Namaste,

Yes, as one gets more used to a ritual, it becomes easier. In the beginning, 
do it ritualistically and get practice. After it becomes easier, now try to 
focus more on the mantra and devata. Instead of focusing on how long it is 
taking or how easy it is, forget about that part now and try to focus on the 
deity and mantra.

One more thing.. Instead of doing a 3 hour homam, getting tired completely 
and not having the energy to meditate with concentration at the end, it is 
better to do a one hour homam and meditate with full concentration for 10-15 
minutes at the end. Even if one does a long homam in the beginning and 
compromises on the quality of meditation, one should eventually find a 
balance between homam and meditation at the end. Do homam for as long as you 
can and then meditate for 10-15 minutes with as perfect concentration as you 
can while the poornaahuti burns. Try to forget everything and focus on the 
mantra. Meditation just after a homam is very effective and take advantage 
of the purity generated by the homam fire.

Best regards,
Narasimha

Namaste Anup ji,

My Daily Homam is still Ganapati Homam. I recite Chandi Paath daily. To 
clarify, i didn't move from Ganapti Homam to Chandi Homam (I think you wish 
to ask the same). However i perform chandi Homam occasionally.

Regarding your query of switching from Ganapati Homam to some other homam, i 
can only say that it depends upon individual. once can have strong 
intuition/urge to switch to some other deity. some people might get indirect 
or direct indications. i do not know about the criteria to fix a time frame 
for switch. peronally for me, i am not having any such 
urge/intuition/indications till date and i have left it to my guru to 
suggest if at all there needs a shift from Ganapati Homam to some other 
homam (say Chandi Homam). however, i must say that i've liking towards 
Chandi homa.

warm regards,
Utpal
