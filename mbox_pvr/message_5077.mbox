Namaste,
 
You are not incorrect, but not fully correct. Moreover, it is to=
ugh to capture some of these ideas in words, as words convey slightly diffe=
rent meaning to different people, based on their life experiences and predi=
spositions.
 
Yes, there is no formula that ensures self-realization in a c=
ertain amount of time and it comes to one through the grace of God. However=
, grace of God does not come to just about anyone - it comes to one who is =
*ready* to receive it. One becomes ready to receive it, through the effort =
put in this life and all previous lives, to overcome weaknesses and conditi=
oning. So effort and sadhana are not useless. The effort we are talking abo=
ut here is not effort to acquire something, but effort to give up something=
.
 
Though it is not incorrect, the view that things are given only by God'=
s grace can, when misunderstood, promote inaction. God's grace does not com=
e to a lazy person doing nothing and waiting for God's grace. God's grace d=
oes not work arbitrarily. God's grace comes to one who has perfect surrende=
r to God. Perfect surrender does not come automatically. Though effort and =
sadhana do not guarantee perfect surrender in a certain amount of time, the=
y do bring it eventually.
 
*        *        *
 
> whatever one does it is=
 based on past karmas only
 
Fruits of past karmas decide one's current sit=
uation and constrain one's current karmas (actions). But they do not comple=
tely decide one's current karmas. One's current karma is in one's hands (wi=
thin the constraints).
 
Of course, one can ask: Does one have a free will =
that acts or does an all-pervading shakti act through one? I am quoting a s=
mall portion from vedic-wisdom message 5009 (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/=
vedic-wisdom/message/5009) below:
 
All pervading shakti works through all =
of us and expresses through all of our desires, actions and knowledge. But =
then, some universal rules of action and reaction govern how this works. Un=
der the push of one's own previous karmas, one is placed in situations that=
 are conducive to certain desires, actions and awareness. The current karma=
s in those situations may further modify the momentum of the push (reaction=
) from previous actions. Though one's current desires, actions and awarenes=
s are actually the work of the all pervading shakti, they are also one's wo=
rk in a way. It depends on how we look at it and how we abstract it. Though=
 Ganges water in a bucket, Ganges water in a small cup, Ganges water in a c=
up in hot weather and Ganges water in a cup in freezing weather are all Gan=
ges water, they are different too. One is more, one is less, one is warm an=
d one is icy. Similarly, the work of all pervading shakti is
different when=
 expressed through different vessels (people) in different situations.

As =
long as one actually feels internally (despite what one may say or pretend =
externally) that one's desires, actions and knowledge are one's own, one is=
 performing karmas and is bound to receive their kaarmik reactions. Only wh=
en the
realization that it is all the work of the all pervading shakti beco=
mes full and completely internalized, does one become free from the cycle o=
f actions and reactions. Until then, all pervading shakti acts through one =
to give appropriate reactions to actions one thinks one is performing.
 
* =
       *        *
 
In astrological terms, horoscope is the sum total of pr=
evious karmas, whose fruits one will have to face. They show the circumstan=
ces faced by one. They do not and cannot determine what actions one engages=
 in, though certain actions are more likely in certain circumstances.
 
Des=
tiny is the sum total of the reactions to the actions committed by one's fr=
ee will. Today's actions of free will become destiny tomorrow (i.e. on a fu=
ture date or in a future life).
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

 that one is so and so person and so and so body without questioning "who a=
