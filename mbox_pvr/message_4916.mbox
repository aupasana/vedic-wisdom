Namaste Utpal,
 
It is saying that one will get the result of "Durgapath", =
but is NOT saying "WITHOUT doing Durgapath". There are a bunch of things on=
e does *along with* Durgapath, i.e. *in addition to* the actual Durgapath (=
or Chandipath), without which one supposedly cannot get the results of Durg=
apath. This line is saying that the results of Durgapath can be obtained by=
 replacing all those supplements with Kunjika. But it is not saying that th=
e basic Durgapath can also be replaced.
 
It is literally saying "one can g=
et the result of Durgapath without doing Kavacha, Argala, Keelaka, Rahasya,=
 Sookta, Dhyana, Nyasa and Archana and by doing just Kunjika stotra instead=
 of them." It is not saying that Durgapath can also be skipped. It is only =
saying that the supplements can be skipped.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
