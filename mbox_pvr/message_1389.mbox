Namaste,
 
It is fine to do multiple homas in the same fire, if the persons=
 doing it have intertwined karmas.
 
If one starts a fire and makes offerin=
gs, an association is made between one's internal fire and that fire. It wi=
ll continue to some extent even after homam finishes, as long as the fire k=
eeps going. If another person makes an association between the same fire an=
d internal fire, then there is some karmik interchange between the persons.=
 If the other person is someone that you do not mind sharing some of your k=
armas and karmaphalas with, then it should be fine.
 
Usually, karmas of pa=
rents and children, wife and husband etc are anyway strongly intertwined in=
 many ways. It should be ok for them to do homam in the same fire, either t=
ogether or one after the other.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

Dear Narsimhaji,
 
Today with your inspiration and help, we did the sho=
rt version of the MahaGanapathy Homam. After completion of the Homam, my mo=
ther felt like doing Sri Ganapathi Artharvashirsa so she sat down and conti=
ned in the same agni. 
Is it advisable to do multiple pujas in the same agn=
i or should we start over again (rekindling)? She did do the sankalpa again=
.
 
Regards,
<deleted>
