Namaste learned friends,
 
I was at WAVES (World Association of Vedic Studies) 2010 conference in Port of Spain, Trinidad and made a presentation on "homam as a tool for spiritual evolution".
 
I tried to find a *balance* between two extreme (and wrong!) views that (1) external sadhana is irrelevant as all is Brahman and internal and that (2) external sadhana magically works when done with ritual perfection.
 
I laid out why rituals are needed, how they actually work, how karma and jnana work together, why homam is special etc, in a smooth flow. I received fantastic compliments from several learned people, both from west and India, for a clear and balanced presentation.
 
A writeup that tries to capture that presentation is now available for a free download. If you are interested, please go to:

If you find the writeup useful, please feel free to benefit from it and pass the word around. Otherwise, kindly ignore.
 
BTW, I followed up this presentation with a two hour practical workshop, where I explained the why and how of homam and did a practical demonstration. According to the organizers, that workshop was the most attended event of the entire conference. My goal was to inspire some people to perform a quick 20 min homam by themselves on a regular basis.
 
Best regards,
PVR Narasimha Rao
