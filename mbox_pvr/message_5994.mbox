Namaste friends,

On the Rishi Panchami day (2011 May 7 - Saturday), we are conducting our 
annual Saamoohika Satya Narayana Vratam near Boston. It is free and 
materials will also be supplied. You are welcome to come and participate 
in the pooja or watch it. For more details, please visit:

http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/pooja

If any out-of-station people are interested in visiting Boston and 
participating, we can arrange free stay at my house or nearby houses of 
volunteers and arrange free transportation to/from the airport/venue. If 
interested, please contact the email address given in the above webpage.

Best regards,
Narasimha
