Subject: Same great feeling again (Re: On Kundalini)

Namaste,

I am willing to do whatever Nature expects me to do for various people, but 
there is no need for people to call me a guru. I do not look at myself as a 
"guru". Only a limited cases where my guru told me I was the "guru" of some 
persons did I agree to the use of that word.

Doing good sadhana only when there is no job and stoping it on getting a job 
is a typical thing. It will be a shame if the so-called prosperity takes one 
away from True spiritual prosperity. Try to find some time for sadhana.

> May request to know how to get the same great feeling

You have to find a way to squeeze some time and do more sadhana. There is 
really no other way.

If one digests that "great feeling" fully and makes it one's own, it can 
accompany one in whatever one does. Otherwise, it comes occasionally during 
meditation and then goes away. Until it becomes permanent and your own, 
there is no other way but to keep doing sadhana.

Consider homam.

Best regards,
Narasimha

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] On Kundalini (Re: Re: Urdhwa-Retas)


Dear Shri Narasimha Guru Ji,

Sadar Namaskar,

May request to call you my Guruji?

GuruJi, The example quoted is very interesting. My age is about 40 years and 
when at the age of 34 lost my job, meet my named guru Shri Gosain Ji first 
time who taught me about how to recit various mantra given by him to me. 
After reciting Mantra for about few month or so regularly my feeling were 
also great as I used to experience full lightining light with my 
concentration remaining on the Mantra, although have full pleasures of those 
moments. After being empoyed once again, which was also the motive at that 
time to recite those mantra, I used to recite them randomly at home at same 
place say once in a week time and that great feeling is not coming. Now 
after busy in my service I do not find time to recit mantra given to me by 
my Guru Ji but whenever find time I do the recitation in my mind. Again the 
home responsibilities are there as well.

May request to know how to get the same great feeling again and again with 
my busy office work schedule.

GuruJi, I am able and trying to learn more and more from your write up on 
this blog. Whenever find some time will also try to see all of your earlier 
writeup.

Many many thanks

Yours sincerely,
Ganesh Gulati
