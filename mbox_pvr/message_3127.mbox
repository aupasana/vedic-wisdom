Namaste,

I am replying to the list without reveal=
ing your identity.

When you are doing an action (e.g. a homam, an archana,=
 a service to the poor in your area etc), it is very unlikely and difficult=
 that you are doing it without an "I" sense. But it is ok. Atleast, you are=
 engaging your I-sense to work for the benefit of the world rather than sel=
f-gratification. When do a homam or archana, you are trying to please a dei=
ty (personification of a particular good quality in all the people of the w=
orld). When you do social service, you are helping needy people. And so on.=


While doing various kinds of sadhana, one tries to take the focus of mind=
 from the limited self (body, name, status, image etc) and expand it to a l=
arger entity (e.g. a deity, a community, a society, a country, universe etc=
). One tries to focus the mind on others and not think much about oneself. =
This helps one overcome mind's natural tendency to focus on limited self an=
d gratification of that limited self.

While doing that, however, thoughts =
may arise "I am doing this good and important work". Such thoughts bring th=
e focus of mind back to the limited self (body, name, status, image etc). B=
y telling oneself that the Lord is doing it though one and that one is mere=
ly an instrument, i.e. by cultivating the spirit of "Sarvam Sri Krishnaarpa=
namastu" , one tries to overcome that tendency towards self-gratification a=
nd/or self-glorification.

After repeated practice, such thinking becomes c=
ommon sense to one and one's mind gets focused on doing what one sees as on=
e's dharma, without any sense of pride or self-gratification or self-glorif=
ication.

* * *

If a priest doing an archana for you takes your name and n=
akshatra in the sankalpam before the pooja, there is nothing to be worried.=
 In your mind, try to think as above.

Some priests go much further and say=
 all kinds of highly specific things in sankalpa. For example, I have seen =
priests say "to give dharma, artha, kaama, moksha, well-being, strength, bo=
ldness, success, fearless, longevity, health, wealth etc to so and so perso=
n, to remove all past, present and future sins and all past, present and fu=
ture problems related to all planets, shadowy planets, sub-planets in rasi,=
 navamsa, drekkana, trimsamsa etc charts at birth, in dasas and in transits=
, and to give results as though all planets are placed in the 11th house an=
d not in the actual house of placement" etc etc. Some priests spend 5-10 mi=
nutes mentioning so many specific desires in sankalpam. When you find a pri=
est saying things like that, I suggest just taking it easy and not getting =
either excited or disturbed. Just think in your mind "I am doing this ritua=
l as a humble offering to you. Please receive it kindly and give whatever y=
ou see as appropriate" and try
 to focus the mind on the deity. What's in y=
our heart is far more important than anything else.

* * *

Cultivating the=
 sense that whatever good work you are doing is being done by the Lord *thr=
ough you* and whatever results (including very bad ones) are given to you a=
re fruits granted by the Lord to your karmas which you should accept withou=
t regrets, is an important activity that should go on outside of the ritual=
 time.

For example, when one's wife or husband (or someone close) yells at=
 one or abuses one, fairly or unfairly, one has a choice. One can either be=
come upset and angry and remain in that mood for a few hours wondering why =
the other person is so unfair/wrong, or one can just accept it as the fruit=
s given by the Lord for one's previous actions and focus the mind on what g=
ood actions can be performed *now*. Similarly, when people praise one, one =
has a choice. One can either become excited and gloat in the praises or one=
 can think that the Lord used one as an instrument in getting that work don=
e and focus the mind on what good actions can be performed *now*.

Best reg=
ards,
Narasimha
