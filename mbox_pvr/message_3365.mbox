Namaste Rajarshi,
=C2=A0
Samadhi literally means absolute focus and concent=
ration. There are different kinds of samadhi and they can be experienced di=
fferently by different people, as you said. You correctly questioned how di=
fferent people can describe "Nirvikalpa samadhi" differently.
=C2=A0
The is=
sue is this. Nirvikalpa samadhi is a state of being where there is no "expe=
riencer", nothing "to experience" and also no act of "experiencing". In oth=
er words, there is no observer (subject), observed (object) and observing (=
action). All merge into one.
=C2=A0
When I-ness (the sense that "this is I.=
 There are others. I can observe them") disappears, what is the basis for a=
ny objectification in the Supreme Cosmic Essence? If there is no objectific=
ation, how can there be any experience or observation? If there is no obser=
vation and experience, how can you describe Nirvikalpa samadhi?
=C2=A0
Bott=
omline is that there is nothing to describe in Nirvikalpa samadhi. Regardin=
g Nirvikalpa samadhi, Manish once said to me: "When I am in Nirvikalpa sama=
dhi, there is no experience. Thus, anything I say about the "experience" of=
 Nirvikalpa samadhi is actually the observation of an I-ness as it is being=
 torn down or being reconstructed, i.e. just before or after Nirvikalpa sam=
adhi but not *during* it."
=C2=A0
This is essentially the problem with "des=
cribing" Nirvikalpa samadhi!
=C2=A0

=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
In terms of the=
 diamond analogy quoted by Kishore, what different yogis are saying about t=
he "experience" of Nirvikalpa samadhi says more about the path they are tak=
ing into the inside of the diamond, rather than describing the inside of th=
e diamond itself. One may think "nothing really exists apart from Brahman -=
 all this I am perceiving is a delusion". Another may think "all I perceive=
 is actually Brahman". Another may think "all that I perceive is actually a=
 minute part of Krishna". And so on. Once one is able to focus I-ness on a =
specific thought and everything else disappears from the mind, one is in sa=
madhi. Once that I-ness also disappears, one is in Nirvikalpa samadhi. Howe=
ver, one can only describe the last thought on which I-ness was focused pri=
or to Nirvikalpa samadhi and NOT the Nirvikalpa samadhi itself.
=C2=A0
Some=
 yogis prefer the stage just before Nirvikalpa samadhi where a trace of I-n=
ess is left in an intense focus on one thought, to Nirvikalpa samadhi itsel=
f. In the former, there is an experience and bliss - some rasa (juice). In =
the latter, there is no experience.

=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Buddha is=
 a great jnaani and his statement is perfect. However, one who is not at Bu=
ddha's wavelength can easily misunderstand it. If an observer exists and ob=
serves "void", that is different. What we are talking about here is the abs=
ence of observer, i.e. merging of observer, observed and the act of observi=
ng into one, without ANY distinction whatsoever between them. Is "void" the=
 right word to describe that state or is "everything" the right word? Is th=
ere a good way to describe it? Problem is that the word "void" may make peo=
ple imagine a scenario where there is an observer, but a void to observe.

      Namaste,
=C2=A0
I un=
derstand the example given in that superb mail, yet some confusion exist (i=
n my understanding) .
=C2=A0
See, Sri Ramakrishna, when he was asked about =
Nirvikalpa Samadhi said he cannot describe it in words like the salt doll e=
xample provided by Hari. 
=C2=A0
> After all, Rigveda says "ekam sat vipraa=
 bahudhaa vadanti", which means

rently" . 
=C2=A0
True. Now I see this line in different ways - 1) As diffe=
rent saints have mentioned different sadhanas/paths to achieve God. 2) Seco=
ndly as you mentioned, that Truth is One, but saints call it differently.
=
=C2=A0
From=C2=A0from the diamond analogy I understand that if=C2=A0X reach=
es a certain face of the diamond and Y reaches another face of the diamond,=
 they percieve it differently, thought both faces are the same diamond, jus=
t different aspects. This is OK. This can be equal to savikalpa samadhi and=
 may be experienced differently depending upon the individual.
=C2=A0
Now
=
=C2=A0

=C2=A0
1) This seems logical =
and is also the main cause of my confusion. When=C2=A0we say that we enter =
the middle of the diamond, when duality is no more, then how can it=C2=A0be=
 experienced differently by different people? Shouldn't it be=C2=A0 the sam=
e? I thought, whichever face of teh diamond you chose as your entry point, =
the middle of teh diamond should feel and look exactly similar. Please corr=
ect me if I am wrong in my understanding.=C2=A0=C2=A0And yet these three sp=
iritual gaints have spoken differently of their realizations. If duality it=
self does not exist, then how can the field of possiblity at all arise? Whi=
ch means, how can there be a difference in the "perception" of the same One=
 final Truth?
=C2=A0
2) Not to mention the query about whether, that which =
is transcendental in its basic nature (Truth/One/Middle of the diamond),=C2=
=A0can=C2=A0at all be=C2=A0described from within the field of duality? Then=
 I wonder why these three people - saints of highest order - try to describ=
e it when all descriptions are from within duality...
=C2=A0
Considering th=
e above, I understand the wisdom (theoritically) of why Ramakrishna refused=
 to describe Nirvikalpa Samadhi.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
I also wonder whether=C2=A0th=
e three saints, Sri Ramana Maharishi, Sri Aurobindo and Lord Buddha were sp=
eaking from teh same realization of=C2=A0the One/Truth, or was it different=
 kinds of realizations. By this I mean, can it be possible that there are d=

Namaste Rajarshi,

The bright=
 star in the sky analogy that Narasimha posted (http://groups. yahoo.com/ g=
roup/vedic- wisdom/message/ 83) may answer your questions.
Few excerpts of =
that mail:

. . .

Sri
 Aurobindo's and Sri Ramana Mahari=
shi's versions seems to be covered in the third and fourth sentences. No ob=
jects or attributes may be equivalent to void as in Buddha's version.
