Dear learned friends,

I will answer the question based on my limited understanding. May the
learned forgive errors made by this fool.

Your question is not simplistic. The answer is both. Rebirth in such a case
happens within the limits of karma that was taken on through free will!

Let me come down a little from the level of Shiva. Let us say there is a
rishi (Sage), who did enough good karma and sadhana to stay in a higher
realm of consciousness (say, Tapoloka) till the end of this world cycle,
without having to take birth again on earth. Let us say he comes back to
earth and is born as Swami Vivekananda or someone like that. What happens to
him? Is he bound by the karmas? If he faces some sufferings, where are the
karmas resulting in that experience coming from?

Whenever a being is born on earth, some of the previously accumulated karmas
are ear-marked as "must experience in this lifetime" karmas. Other karmas
accumulated in the past may or may not be experienced in this lifetime and
may be reserved for future. But those specially marked karmas MUST be
experienced (or burnt through sadhana) in the current lifetime no matter
what.

If a rishi or a god is born on earth, there may not be enough bad karmas to
be marked as "must experience in this lifetime" karmas. Then, in order to be
born on this earth, the rishi or god may "take on" new karmas through
freewill.

This can be done in several ways. One can take karmas from some other
beings. Moreover, the decision of rebirth itself brings new karmas. For
example, one's choice of mother and father instantly creates new karmas. If
a rishi decides to be born to certain parents, some of the karmas of those
parents and their ancestors are automatically tranferred to him. The choice
of the place can also transfer some part of the karmas associated with that
place (town, country etc) to the person. Thus, the moment a rishi or a god
decides to be born on earth, a set of karmas is created.

But, typically, reborn gods and rishis carry very little bad karma and a lot
of good karma. During the course of life, some more bad karmas may be added.
But, overall, they are karmically light (as opposed to heavy). It is
relatively easy to burn those karmas and become free. Still, it is possible
even for a reborn rishi to struggle for several decades before becoming
enlightened.

Bottomline: In the case of those who are born on earth without being forced
to, it is a result of karmas that were taken on through free will.

Best regards,
Narasimha
