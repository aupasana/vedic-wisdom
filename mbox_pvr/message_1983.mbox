Namaste,

It wasn't pasu bali (animal sacrifice). It was merely some raisins that we 
offered as bali, around the homa kundam.

Best regards,
Narasimha

>> karmas. Both are very important sadhanas for spiritual progress.

>>           Devatas are very subtle forms of consciousness. Their

>> They work on your individual soul and free it from the karmas it carries.
