Namaste,
 
I am cc'ing this to vedic-wisdom yahoogroup.

ob in doing that.
 
Yes, the goal of life is to pay off karmik debts. But, =
the way most of us live, we are constantly accumulating new debts.
 
True, =
God does a fine job. But it also depends on us. Just as a master director m=
aking an epic movie with a superb script may not give a meaty role to a bad=
 actor, god cannot help you clear all your debts if you do not have the rig=
ht attitude.
 
It is all fine to make a *theoretical* statement "god is doi=
ng though me whatever I do. I am not doing anything" and then go on to enjo=
y all kinds of sense pleasures, but one cannot trick god like that. God wil=
l then say, "yes, it is *I* who is making you engage in all these sense ple=
asures. But, you know what, I will also make you suffer the consequences la=
ter." If you read scriptures, imbibe their essence in your thinking, spend =
time with the holy people, spend time doing sadhana and make a conscious ef=
fort to overcome weaknesses, then God will help you pay off your debts fast=
er. What God does with each person depends on the attitude, conditioning an=
d efforts of that person.
 
> If on the other hand, we were to ask God to l=
et us pay more of it,
> won't we be in effect be asking the Lord for even a=
 more severe
> drubbing to pay off karmas faster?
 
You need not ask God to=
 give either less or more suffering. As you said, "God does a fine job". Wh=
at you need to ask god is strength and faith to withstand suffering coming =
as a result of previous karmas and wisdom to engage in the right karmas *no=
w*.
 
> If I may ask....do you have such an art?
 
No, I do not.
 
But I kn=
ow one person who considers Aghora series of books by Robert Svoboda (about=
 Vimalananda) to be a practical manual, albeit coded. He claims to have fig=
ured out specific detials about specific sadhanas from those books and trie=
d them out to find some specific results that are quite amazing.
 
> I bele=
ive that there is nothing impossible for the lord to do, it is
> all about =
making oneself worthy of HIS attention or blessings. 
 
Yes. One should imp=
rove the devotion one may have and surrender to the Lord. Whatever one is i=
nspired from within to do, one should do to the best of one's ability. What=
ever happens as a result, one should accept it as the will of the Lord and =
take good and bad with an equal vision. If one does it, one is worthy of Lo=
rd's attention and blessings. However, when and in what form Lord's blessin=
gs and attention come depends on Lord's will and plan. One can only patient=
ly wait.
 
If there are ten vessels at our house, we may use one for making=
 tea, one for cooking dal, one for making rice, one for storing sweets and =
so on. But, if there is a dirty vessel, we do not use it.

Similarly, Lord =
may use clean vessels at his disposal for various tasks. One person may be =
used for building temples. One person may be used for reviving one specific=
 kind of knowledge. One person may be used for teaching Sanskrit to childre=
n. One person may be used for spreading homam. One person may be used for t=
eaching praanaayaama. And so on. First, become a clean vessel and then wait=
 for Lord to use you.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

 Siva Homa Question)


  Namaste Narasimha Rao Ji,,

  Let me clarify at th=
is point that my queries below are not meant at disputing but rather unders=
tanding the extent and intent af any sadhana. I will be most grateful for y=
our patience and time and answering some of these questions.

  You say:
  =
Similarly, one can ask god to make one's life meaningful and worthwhile, en=
able one to pay off one's kaarmik debts

  But isn't anyones present life a=
ll about paying off one's karmik debt? God does a fine job in doing that. I=
t is only when we begin to feel the pain of our past deeds...deeds that we =
are not even aware of becuase they have happened over a past few lives, tha=
t we have to ask god for help in making things more manageable. If on the o=
ther hand, we were to ask God to let us pay more of it, won't we be in effe=
ct be asking the Lord for even a more severe drubbing to pay off karmas fas=
ter? That will only be asked of by people who have a greate degree of self-=
confidence. Very few people with high level of self-confidence choose to bo=
w their heads before the Lord.

  You also say:
  I will put it slightly di=
fferently. That art is *nearly* extinct, but not fully extinct. Nevertheles=
s, for all practical purposes, it is extinct.

  If I may ask....do you hav=
e such an art? Do not worry, I will not be bugging you for details. How doe=
s siddhi help in acheiving this art? How does dhyana yoga help achieve sidd=
hi and where does Siva Homa (or any homa) play a role in this? I have read =
that a good channel of communication with the Lord tremendously helps in fi=
ghting conflicts (over here I am talking about conflicts between desires an=
d lifes reality) and help keep a balance between material progress and spri=
ritual progress, and a good line of communication with Lord is acheived thr=
ough siddhi. I beleive that there is nothing impossible for the lord to do,=
 it is all about making oneself worthy of HIS attention or blessings. Pleas=
e let me know if my understanding is correct or if I am building my castle =
in dreamland. 

  Thanks,
  Bhupendra.

  Namaste,

  > I do share your viewpoint. But=
 does the Lord give without asking?

  Let us go back to the analogy I gave=
. Let us say a master director is making an epic movie and you have a small=
 role in the movie. Only the director knows the entire script and you only =
know your scene. Instead of telling the director how your scane should be, =
you should just leave it to the director.

  At the same time, it does not =
hurt to tell the director, "I am willing to work hard, rehearse well and do=
 the best job I can. If possible, please give me a good role". Exactly what=
 that "good role" should be is better left to the director.

  Similarly, o=
ne can ask god to make one's life meaningful and worthwhile, enable one to =
pay off one's kaarmik debts, help increase dharma in the world and make pro=
gress towards liberation. Other specific requests may not be helpful. Howev=
er, I realize that many people will find the need to make other specific re=
quests.

t forever.

  I will put it slightly differently. That art is *nearly* exti=
nct, but not fully extinct. Nevertheless, for all practical purposes, it is=
 extinct.

  <DIV>Let me clarify at this point that=
 my queries below are not meant at

  will be most grateful for your pat=

  <DIV>B=
ut isn't anyones present life all about paying off one's karmik debt? 
  Go=
d does a fine job in doing that. It is only when we begin to feel the pain =

  of our past deeds...deeds that we are not even aware of becuase they hav=
e 
  happened over a past few lives, that we have to ask god for help in ma=
king 
  things more manageable. If on the other hand, we were to ask God to=
 let us pay 
  more of it, won't we be in effect be asking the Lord for eve=
n a more severe 
  drubbing to pay off karmas faster? That will only be ask=
ed of by people who 
  have a greate degree of self-confidence. Very few pe=
ople with high level of 
  self-confidence choose to bow their heads before=
 the Lord.</DIV>
  <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>

DIV>You also say:</DIV>
  <DIV><STRONG>I will put it slightly differently. =

ll practical purposes, it is 
  extinct.</STRONG></DIV>
  <DIV><FONT face=

  <DIV>If I may ask....do you have su=
ch an art? Do not worry, I will not be 
  bugging you for details. How does=
 siddhi help in acheiving this art? How does 
  dhyana yoga help achieve si=
ddhi and where does Siva Homa (or any homa) play a 
  role in this? I have =
read that a good channel of communication with the Lord 
  tremendously hel=

  conflicts between=
 desires and lifes reality) and help keep a balance 
  between materia=
l progress and spriritual progress, and a good line of

  is nothing =

  materials in homam (To Narasimha Rao Ji - S=
iva Homa Question)<BR>> 
  <BR>>  <BR>> Namaste,<BR>> <BR>=
> Two points:<BR>> <BR>> 
  (1) A mother may sense that a child is=
 about to catch cold and she may prepare 
  a bitter medicine for the child=
 to suppess cold in the early stage. Unaware of 
  Mother's thinking, child=
 may ask for Kaju katli and may suffer with cold and 
  cough for several d=
ays.<BR>> <BR>> Instead of trying to get specific 
  results, the bes=
t approach is to leave it to Him/Her and do homam/japam 
  without any spec=
ific desires. Instead of being an older child who knows a lot 
  of things =
and has to fend for himself, be a small child who does not know much 
  and=
 who depends on parents.<BR>> <BR>> This simple approach will 
  opti=
mize the results you get from your sadhana. Sometimes (many times) what 
  =
you want may not be the right thing for you. God is the Director with the f=
ull 
  script of the movie in hand, while we are two cent actors who act in=
 one or 
  two scenes and know nothing about the rest of the movie. Why not=
 leave it to 
  the Director, instead of taking charge and trying to dictat=
e how a particular 
  scene should be handled, when we know nothing about t=
he whole movie and how 
  our character fits in the whole script?<BR>> <=
BR>> (2) Shastras do 
  prescribe specific materials for specific result=
s. However, I suggest that it 
  is not so simple as offering a specific ma=
terial. Offering a specific material 
  is only one aspect in getting a res=
ult.<BR>> <BR>> Just for reference, I 
  will mention a few things gi=
ven in shastras.<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>> 
  <BR>> For getting mon=
ey, use the leaves of bilva (bel) tree. To extend 
  longevity, use darbhas=
 (sacred grass). For getting physical strength, use the 
  canes of vetas (=
rattan palm or Calamus rotang) tree. For getting married and 
  marital bli=
ss, use parched rice. For getting a child, use the seeds of shaali 
  tree =
(also known as kaalonji or krishna jeera or black cumene seeds). For 
  cat=
tle and well-being, use ghee. For knowledge, use the wood of Palaasha tree =

  (palash/modugu/ Butea monosperma). For success in agriculture, use barle=
y 
  grains. For overcoming enemies, use guggul (a resin with anti-choleste=
rol 
  properties in ayurveda). For good health, use sesame seeds - white f=
or mental 
  (and spiritual) health and black for physical. For general hap=
piness and 
  prosperity, use various grains such as rice, juwar dhani etc.=
 For good 
  relations and attracting others, use the flowers or seeds of d=
aadimi 
  (anaar/daanimma/ pomegranate) .<BR>> <BR>> Similarly, Shiva=
 taught 
  Parvati specific materials for the six activities: shaanti (peac=
e-making) , 
  stambhana (paralyzing) , maarana (killing), uchchaatana (exp=
lusion), 
  vashikarana (creating attraction between people) and vidveshana=
 (creating 
  hatred between people). For example, one can use darbha (sacr=
ed grass) dipped 
  in ghee made with cow's milk for shanti (peace-making) =
. These activities 
  (other than peace-making) entail bad karma and not fo=
r normal sadhakas. These 
  activities are justified only when a highly ele=
vated sadhaka performs them for 
  the greater good of the world. So I will=
 not even mention those specific 
  materials.<BR>> <BR>> * * *<BR>&g=
t; <BR>> The art of getting specific 
  results through rituals has almo=
st disappeared and will become more extinct as 
  time passes. Within Kali =
yuga, we are entering a renewal/redefinitio n phase 
  where knowledge will=
 be re-established for the upcoming phase of further decay 
  of dharma. Th=
ere will be re-establishment of dharma in the next 200-400 years, 
  but wi=
th focus on setting rules and procedures that will be the guiding light 
  =
for the next 1-2 thousand years when dharma will decay more. In that upcomi=
ng 
  phase of decay, this art will become even more extinct and the ground=
 will be 
  (is being) set. <BR>> <BR>> Best regards,<BR>> Narasim=
