Namaste,
 
(1) Hiranyagarbha literally means the golden seed or the golden womb. The expression golden symblizes something absolutely pure and pristine. For example, if you read the description of Aadya Shakti (root energy) in Saptashati rahasya, she is described as golden hued (tapta kaanchana varNaabhaa) though the three shaktis emanating from that Aadya Shakti (Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati) are described differently.
 
Hiranyagarbha is the purest one, the source of all. We are essentially talking about the Supreme Cosmic Being, though one could differentiate subtly and say that Hiranyagarbha is the source of the Supreme Cosmic Being. Hiranyagarbha is the Supreme Cosmic Source and Supreme Cosmic Being is the transformation of that source into this universe.
 
However, one may practically view Hiranyagarbha, Parama Purusha (supreme cosmic being) and Ishwara (supreme lord) as synonyms.
 
When the universe arose from Parama Purusha, specific deities like Shiva and Vishnu arose from Parama Purusha and they play specific roles in this universe. But they have overcome the ego (that made them play specific roles in this universe) *completely* and realized their nature as identical to Parama Purusha. Thus, people may worship Shiva, Vishnu etc as supreme cosmic being also.
 
(2) Praana is that which causes motion in mind and makes it function and become aware of various things. It is the kinetic aspect of Shakti. Without this kinetic energy, mind will be unable to see, hear, feel etc.
 
When Brahman manifests as an individualized consciousness, it has various aspects - ahamkara (I-ness), chitta (conditioning), buddhi (logic), manas (mind) etc. The division of Brahman into "I" and "Others" operates through manas. Praana is the kinetic energy that allows manas to observe the objects within Brahman and to affect changes in them.
 
(3) Each prajapati is the source of all beings in a specific realm of existence. Hiranyagarbha is the source of all beings in all realms of existence. They are similar, but at a different abstraction level.
 
(4) Viraat means the supreme lord. It is synonymous to Parama Purusha or Supreme Cosmic Being, who is a transformation of Hiranyagarbha.
 
(5) Many Krishna worshippers worship Krishna as Virat Purusha and believe him to be the source of all beings. Many Shiva worshippers worship Shiva as Viraat Purusha and believe him to be the source of all beings. In other words, people are not directly trying for communion with supreme cosmic being, but through a specific manifestation of the supreme cosmic being. You worship Krishna or Shiva or Ganesha or Surya or some other deity as a specific form with specific role in the universe and eventually try to realize that deity as the supreme source of the entire universe.
 
Hiranyagarbha is attainable through jnaana. Bhakti is easier towards a specific form like Krishna or Shiva with specific attributes, rather than Hiranyagarbha. Once bhakti maarga purifies a person, one can develop in jnaana maarga and realize the beloved deity with a specific form to be the supreme source of all.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

We only read of them when someone is discussion the Upanishats, not practical sadhana. We see only sadhakas attaining communion with deities like Siva, Vishnu, Krishna, Kali etc. What could be the reason?
