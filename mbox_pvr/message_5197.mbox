Namaste,
 
Yes, my answer to question (4) applies to question (3) also. When I wrote "I am not sure of this", I was thinking specifically of the scriptural basis of the story of Santoshi Ma, who is supposed to be the daughter of Ganapathi.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

> Namaste Narasimha garu,  I am surprised at your response to the 3rd question.  wouldn't it be along the same lines as your response to the 4th question?  Aren't we worshipping that creator through his/her creation which could be a stone or something that we created out of our imagination (which again is his/her manifestation) like gramadevatas?  Based on your explanation, Gramadevatas could very well be the projections of someone's imaginations, which are equally true to the person who percieved them as Mahalakshmi or Durga to most of us.  Am I totally off on this?

Goddess Durga creates a formidable fort around the individualized consciousness and that fort protects it from attacks by internal enemies and also from one's own conditioning. When a sadhaka is protected by Durga from all ten directions, one's conditioning cannot attack one from any of the ten directions.

Those who know Jyotish may recall that Maharshi Parasara mentions the rulers of ten directions as the rulers of ten parts in a chart known as "dasaamsa chakra", which, according to Parasara, shows the work done by one. Indra, the ruler of east, shows administrative work. Agni, the ruler of southeast, shows transformative work. Yama, the ruler of south, shows disciplinary work. Nirriti, the ruler of southwest, shows pathbreaking work. And so on.
> >

When Durga is protecting one's consciousness with all ten hands, one may do any kind of work and yet remain untouched by pride, anger, shame and such notions stemming from conditioning. In other words, one performs actions with detachment.
> >

Eighteen handed Mahalakshmi is its devata and the actual killer of Mahishasura, as you correctly say, as per Chandipath. Mahisha literally means the mighty one. Mahishasura personifies our tendency to feel mighty or great. When mother Durga creates a durga (fort) around one's consciousness and protects from all directions, the seed is sowed for the killing of the tendency towards self-importance and pride.
> >  
> > That results in the establishment of the eighteen-handed form of Mahalskshmi within one's consciousness. The eighteen hands represent eighteen virtues, which are the signs of a liberated being. They stem from the solar (push) and lunar (pull) principles applied to the nine qualities represented by nine grahas (consciousness grabbers). When eighteen-handed Mahalakshmi is established in one's consciousness, it means that one's consciousness is endowed with these eighteen virtues and one is unaffected by the tendency towards self-importance and pride. That means the formidable demon Mahisha is dead!

At the end, it is a symbol. If Durga were to really come and bless you, you would first show tenacity and commitment to dharma over a period of time and your consciousness will start to be guarded from the tendency to feel proud.

My friend, we are all characters from a nested dream sequence that finally traces back to the Creator. Our creativity finally traces back to the Creator. Even if I think I am imagining a new form that nobody ever imagined, I am most likely imagining something that was considered by the Creator or a rishi long back.

But, if someone else is imagining a form that you are not aware of, you may not worry about that person! In the end, the person will experience something if one is ready and not experience anything if one is unready.
