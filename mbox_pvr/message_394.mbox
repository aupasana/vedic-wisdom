This is the dilemma faced by a lot of householders. You =
asked specifically about one area of life. I will actually generalize the q=
uestion a bit and answer it.

Suppose you want to engage in what you percei=
ve as a good action and someone is throwing obstacles. Should you fight and=
 try to engage in the action at any cost or accept the obstacle as a fruit =
of previous karma and move on? This is a very tricky question. Let me give =
my 2 cents on it.

*        *        *

It is true that one has to engage i=
n the right actions. However, it is also true that the reactions to previou=
s actions are received constantly and they create various easy and difficul=
t circumstances for current actions. In other words, all our actions take p=
lace in the backdrop of encouraging or discouraging circumstances created b=
y nature as a reaction to our previous actions.

If somebody is throwing ob=
stacles at you, giving you trouble and stopping you from engaging in what y=
ou consider as the right action, it is obviously a payback for previous act=
ions. Of course, if the person being used as a medium for this payback by t=
he nature identifies with that action (of throwing an obstacle at you), it =
becomes new karma for that person and that person will have to pay for it l=
ater. But that is *that person's* problem and not yours. As far as you are =
concerned, nature is finding a medium (other person creating problems) and =
paying you back for your past actions via that medium. You should not waste=
 time and emotional energy in thoughts like "why is this happening" or "I w=
ish this did not happen".

One cannot be stuck in the past and should live =
in the present. The only question one should always focus on is: what is th=
e correct action *now*? Past actions are over. Their fruits are not in our =
hands. There is no point in thinking about them. We should only think about=
 what to do *now*.

*        *        *

Acceptance of the fruits of previo=
us actions is a must for progress. However, accepting the fruit of a previo=
us action does not mean not fighting it. If the correct action *now* is to =
fight, one should fight. But, even as one fights, one should not be thinkin=
g "why did this happen" or "I hate this" or "why is he doing this to me" or=
 "why did I do that before" etc. Emotional investment in such thoughts is a=
 waste of time and energy and, more importantly, an unnecessary new karma!!=
 Accept that a karma has been committed and a fruit (tasty or rotten) has b=
een given by the nature. Accept it. The only question is: what is the right=
 course of action now? Focus on that consciously.

Suppose you are driving =
on a one lane road and someone is going very slowly in front of you. You sl=
owed someone down in the past and caused inconvenience. For that karma, nat=
ure used a new person as the medium and paid you back. Now, a lot of people=
 become frustrated and start cursing the person in front of them. That is u=
seless and new karma. That amounts to not accepting the fruit of a previous=
 karma. Instead, think of what to do. Can you take a different turn and cha=
nge the route? Is it worthwhile? If not, is there an area where you can saf=
ely and legally overtake the slow car by driving on the other side of the r=
oad momentarily? Think along the lines of current action and pick the best =
possible action. If even the best possible action is not good enough, well,=
 so be it. Nothing can be done about it.

Thus, I am differentiating betwee=
n not accepting the fruits of previous actions and picking correct current =
actions to overcome the trouble caused by the fruits of previous actions. T=
he former is bad and avoidable. The latter is fine.

If you are always focu=
ssed on the "present" and "current action", without the unnecessary emotion=
al baggage of "why" and "why not" about the past, you minimize emotional su=
ffering and energy dispersion and maximize your efficiency. Thus, this appr=
oach makes sense not only spiritually but practically too.

*        *     =
   *

While that is good, that is not all. Even one behaving like that will=
 incur new karmas. Each current action becomes new karma and gives fruits l=
ater. In fact, each action has various repercussions and enables various ot=
her people to engage in various other actions. A part of all those actions =
enabled by one's action comes to the doer of the original action. Thus, eac=
h new action generates several new karmas. This will result in fruits later=
 on, which may encourage or discourage one's future actions.

How do we get=
 out of this cycle? Well, by performing the action without a sense of owner=
ship. However, the fact that we are engaging in an action means there is an=
 expected result. We are performing an action because we ideally want a par=
ticular result and our judgment says that this action will bring that resul=
t. When we want a result and do an action, how can we let go the sense of o=
wnership over it?
 
It is mighty tough. That is why I suggest an intermedia=
te step. When planning an action, think of a goal and plan the action. But,=
 once the action is done, you can forget about the goal as well as the acti=
on. When an action finishes, surrender ownership over it to the Lord. Think=
 that you are now not the owner of the action or its goal or its fruit. It =
belongs to Lord. Don't waste any further time thinking and analyzing the ta=
sk. "Oops, I should have done like that", "Why couldn't I do it right", "Wi=
ll it work? Will I get it?" etc are useless thoughts. Once the action is ov=
er, there is really nothing you need to do. You should surrender it to the =
Lord and move on (to focus on the next action).
 
*        *        *

I am=
 not giving a specific solution to a specific problem here, but outlining t=
he methodology.
 
Going back to your example, suppose your current desired =
good action is brahmacharya. Suppose the obstacle is that your spouse force=
s you to have sex. This is a fruit of your previous actions. There is no re=
ason to hate him or dislike him or harbor ill-feelings for him. That amount=
s to not accepting the fruits of your actions. That does not pertain to the=
 question "what should be the current action". That is more like "why I hat=
e the fruit of my previous action". That is a useless activity.

Instead se=
e if there is something that can be done. By discussing or even fighting (i=
t is possible to fight without hatred or anger in the heart. Anger and hatr=
ed in the heart is non-acceptance of the fruit of previous actions, while t=
he act of fighting or appearing to fight can merely be the best current act=
ion!), do you have a decent chance of convincing? If you think you do, that=
 may be the correct current action to undertake. If not, don't waste time. =
If you have to anyway go through with something, you just go through with i=
t. When the correct action you want is impossible, you perform whatever act=
ion is the best among feasible actions.
 
Anyway, whichever action you perf=
orm - good or bad, you surrender it to Lord in the end! So, it matters only=
 for a short while. After that, the action is not yours anyway. If it is an=
 action you are performing without interest, you can try to surrender the a=
ction to the Lord even as the action is being performed and try to do it wi=
thout attachment and involvement. Of course, the same can done with actions=
 you like also, but it is more difficult.
 
Whether good or bad, if an acti=
on is surrendered to the Lord, we form a distance from it. We do not think =
too much about it and we do not waste time speculating about what result wi=
ll come etc.

*        *        *

Bottomline: Two thumb rules: (1) Focus o=
n current action and always ask "what is the *best* thing I can do in the *=
current* circumstances? (2) After doing what you decided do, surrender the =
owenership over that action, its goals and its fruits to God. Do NOT think =
about that action or its goals or its fruits after that. Think about someth=
ing else (like "what should I do NOW").

*        *        *

Actually what=
 I wanted to write is not over, but my budget of time is over. So I have to=
 stop for tonight. I have been busy at work and working late hours everyday=
 and coming home quite late, for the last 2.5 weeks. I was also working ful=
l days in the last 2 weekends. I have been sleeping very little and today I=
 want to get a little extra sleep.

What I mentioned is karma yoga in a nut=
 shell (not the above about work and sleep ;-) but the stuff before it). Bh=
agavad Geeta is a great text. Swami Vivekananda's book on Karma Yoga is a g=
ood one.

Best regards,
Narasimha

  Hare Rama Krsna
  Sri Narasimha garu,
  Namaskar.
=
  Pardon me for writing to your mail id.
  I have had conflicts of thought =
on the concept of brahmacharya in house-holders.
  Especially when one of t=
he spouses is inclined to brahmacharya and the other is equally opposite. W=
hen the children are grown enough to 'flow the nest', a western derivative =
and the primary objective of raising children is over and done with, indulg=
ence( over??) soemtimes provokes these thoughts. Especially when I read mai=
ls like these. This has been my personal dilemma. To be or not to be, that =
is the question...
  I would be frank here, my spouse 'enjoys' the physical=
 aspect of marital bliss and though I feel it  affects the marriage, I pref=
er to delegate it to the last of my list. This has been a source of argumen=
ts and conflicts and I sometimes feel if it is my 'duty' to be a part of it=
. It is at times like these that I tend to 'surrender' to The Divine Mother=
, the very physical act. I am riddled with doubts if it is alright to do so=
 but take solace that She is the Akhilandakoti Brahmandanayika who is overs=
eeing the whole world. 

  I also feel very closely aligned to the Mother a=
nd constantly 'talk' to her for reassurance etc and she has never failed to=
 guide me through, albeit through subtle cryptic messages which I cannot sh=
are with my spouse but with my siblings and mother who are all very spiritu=
ally inclined.
  In my recent visit to India, I had an onerous task of ... =
It was accomplished single-handedly( unseen Grace) and ... I feel that the =
purpose of my birth is not just 'living' but transform this diseased body i=
nto a 'vessel of Godhead' as She had herself communicated to my question on=
 one of my birthdays. But i feel that I have not been doing anything about =
the cleansing the 'sareeras' to make it fit for the Divine to manifest in e=
ach of the cells of my body. I have just started to chant Vishnusahasranama=
m each week at my friends' houses which also does not seem to give that ana=
nda that I derive just bringing one of Her names to my mind and her picture=
 which makes it impossible for me to continue with ther sahasranamam.

  Ma=
y I have your thoughts on these?
  It is perfectly OK is you reply on the f=
orum,

  Kind Regards,
  <deleted>

sleep ;-) but the stuff=
 before it). Bhagavad Geeta is a great text. Swami
