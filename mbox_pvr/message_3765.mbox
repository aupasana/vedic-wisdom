Namaste,
 
Two points:
 
(1) A mother may sense that a child is about to catch cold and she may prepare a bitter medicine for the child to suppess cold in the early stage. Unaware of Mother's thinking, child may ask for Kaju katli and may suffer with cold and cough for several days.
 
Instead of trying to get specific results, the best approach is to leave it to Him/Her and do homam/japam without any specific desires. Instead of being an older child who knows a lot of things and has to fend for himself, be a small child who does not know much and who depends on parents.
 
This simple approach will optimize the results you get from your sadhana. Sometimes (many times) what you want may not be the right thing for you. God is the Director with the full script of the movie in hand, while we are two cent actors who act in one or two scenes and know nothing about the rest of the movie. Why not leave it to the Director, instead of taking charge and trying to dictate how a particular scene should be handled, when we know nothing about the whole movie and how our character fits in the whole script?
 
(2) Shastras do prescribe specific materials for specific results. However, I suggest that it is not so simple as offering a specific material. Offering a specific material is only one aspect in getting a result.
 
Just for reference, I will mention a few things given in shastras.
 
*        *        *
 
For getting money, use the leaves of bilva (bel) tree. To extend longevity, use darbhas (sacred grass). For getting physical strength, use the canes of vetas (rattan palm or Calamus rotang) tree. For getting married and marital bliss, use parched rice. For getting a child, use the seeds of shaali tree (also known as kaalonji or krishna jeera or black cumene seeds). For cattle and well-being, use ghee. For knowledge, use the wood of Palaasha tree (palash/modugu/Butea monosperma). For success in agriculture, use barley grains. For overcoming enemies, use guggul (a resin with anti-cholesterol properties in ayurveda). For good health, use sesame seeds - white for mental (and spiritual) health and black for physical. For general happiness and prosperity, use various grains such as rice, juwar dhani etc. For good relations and attracting others, use the flowers or seeds of daadimi (anaar/daanimma/pomegranate).
 
Similarly, Shiva taught Parvati specific materials for the six activities: shaanti (peace-making), stambhana (paralyzing), maarana (killing), uchchaatana (explusion), vashikarana (creating attraction between people) and vidveshana (creating hatred between people). For example, one can use darbha (sacred grass) dipped in ghee made with cow's milk for shanti (peace-making). These activities (other than peace-making) entail bad karma and not for normal sadhakas. These activities are justified only when a highly elevated sadhaka performs them for the greater good of the world. So I will not even mention those specific materials.
 
*        *        *
 
The art of getting specific results through rituals has almost disappeared and will become more extinct as time passes. Within Kali yuga, we are entering a renewal/redefinition phase where knowledge will be re-established for the upcoming phase of further decay of dharma. There will be re-establishment of dharma in the next 200-400 years, but with focus on setting rules and procedures that will be the guiding light for the next 1-2 thousand years when dharma will decay more. In that upcoming phase of decay, this art will become even more extinct and the ground will be (is being) set. 
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

Essentially, what I am asking is that is there any offerings that we may offer based on what we would like to achieve through this homa such as if there is any materials more suitable for homa being performed for health reasons or if the homa is being performed for hapiness or knowledge or financial prosperity/security? If there is none, then it doesn't matter, however if there is just to much for you to list them out, then I would request if you could point me to some resource maybe on the internet from where I may obtain this information.
