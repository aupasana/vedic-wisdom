ng on this. 
=C2=A0
If you love yourself, your body, your titles, your stat=
us, your honor, your 
family, your nation etc, your ability to love god wil=
l be minimized. If you 
de-focus the mind from all these things and focus i=
t on god, you can love god 
more. Please note than I am not talking about i=
ntentionally ignoring or 
mistreating any of these. After all, they too are=
 a small aspect of god. But, 
stop the over-focus of the mind on these thin=
gs. Do what needs to be done to 
sustain them, but do not focus the mind ov=
erly on them.
=C2=A0
Whatever you see, think of and do, bring god into it. =
For example, suppose you 
are taking bath. Think of water as an aspect of g=
od. Be thankful to it and pour 
it on yourself with reverence and a sense o=
f sacredness. Suppose you are eating 
food. Think of food as an aspect of g=
od. Be grateful to it and consume it with 
reverence and a sense of sacredn=
ess. Suppose you are discussing something with a 
friend. Think of the frie=
nd as an aspect of god and deal with him with a sense 
of sacredness. Suppo=
se you are writing a software program on the computer. Think 
of the comput=
er and the work you do as an aspect of god and approach it with 
reverence =
and a sense of sacredness. This attitude can be extended to every 
activity=
.
=C2=A0
When you do homam, think that god is indeed in the fire. Be thankf=
ul to fire and 
to god. Whatever you offer and chant, do it with feeling. I=
f you start 
identifying god in every perception, thought and action and br=
ing awareness of 
god to every moment of your life, you will realize the in=
finite nature of god 
and love, devotion and surrender will automatically c=
ome.

Good thinking! He is getting it done in reality. But, if there is a=
 sense of 
ownership inside you, then you are doing it for all practical pu=
rposes.
=C2=A0
Ponder over this carefully: God is in everyone and does ever=
ything, but god gets 
things done through a person, *in accordance with* th=
e conditioning of that 
person. God makes each person experience good and b=
ad things, *in accordance 
with* what good and bad things he had earlier go=
t done through that person. Our 
conditioning influences what we do and wha=
t we do influence what results we 
experience. As long as we take different=
 experiences differently and prefer some 
experiences to some others (despi=
te pretending outwardly that we do not care), 
we do have some rawness (con=
ditioning) left and need to use free will to 
overcome it.

BTW, Narayana Hridayam is very very powerful. Ideally, you =
are supposed to chant 
Lakshmi Hridayam after Narayana Hridayam and not jus=
t chant Narayana Hridayam. 
Even if you repeat it many times, you are suppo=
sed to chant Lakshmi Hridayam 
after Narayana Hridayam each time. This is w=
hat tradition demands. Basically, 
Narayana is the Supreme Cosmic Self and =
Lakshmi is the manifested world arising 
out of Self. You cannot ignore the=
 latter and only focus on the former.

Out of=
 so many prayers I know, Narayana Hridayam-Lakshmi Hridayam is the one I 
f=
eel the most attraction to.
=C2=A0
I spent a Friday in 2010 navaratris chan=
ting Narayana Hridayam and Lakshmi 
Hridayam for a whole day. I started lon=
g before sunrise, finished my daily 
Chandi homam and then started a long h=
omam with Narayana Hridayam and Lakshmi 
Hridayam. I kept repeating them an=
d did homam till 2:30 pm or so (I did not 
count how many times I repeated =
them. It is better that way!). I had two 
fistfuls of food and then went ba=
ck. Instead of homam now, I spent the second 
half of the day chanting Nara=
yana Hridayam and Lakshmi Hridayam. I continued 
till the night. (Spending =
one whole day doing a specific mantra or prayer like 
this is a nice sadhan=
a and others may consider it.)
=C2=A0
It was very nice, especially when I w=
as doing homam. A very nice and intense 
state, where it feels like every p=
art of my body and mind is about to explode 
into an unlimited state (it is=
 tough to describe and find the right words), 
which I experienced before o=
nly when in deep meditation with a still body, was 
experienced for the fir=
st time while I was moving and my eyes were wide open! In 
fact, that state=
 lasted a long time.
=C2=A0
When one does homam with a prayer one has a dee=
p connection to, when one is able 
to identify with (or relate to) the pray=
er, when one brings feeling to one's 
prayer, and when one is focused very =
well and has a good level of devotion, 
anything is possible with fire!

Just today i did a homam with Narayan hrudayam for first time, i didn=

After reading this post of yours i know the essense of narayan a=

he loves Narayan hrudayam. 

- In this situation i cant h=

Form your post I can see clearly the limitations of our condi=

you. 


Question 
- How does one directly generate im=

nice if you can share your learn=
