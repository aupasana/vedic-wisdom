Namaste,
 
There are MANY yahoogroups for astrology, such as vedic-astrolog=
y. I absolutely do not want any horoscope discussions here. This yahoogroup=
 is strictly for spiritual matters. Please use other yahoogroups and do not=
 post requests for astrological advice here. Also, if someone requests astr=
ological advice, please do not respond on this yahoogroup.
 
Thank you for =
your co-operation.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

      Your 7th house is much stronger than the 6th house. The 6th house is =
the house of career wherein you need to work for somebody but here it is no=

with other malefic like Venus and Saturn.

      I suggest you get into business.  Career does not suit you

        Y=
ou will do good in business as Mars the lord of 7th house is sitting in 9th=
 house and exalted. And 9th house is the house of  Vishnu who would be prot=
ecting you in your business

        In the mean time I suggest you to kind=

t the rahu and ketu pooja done in the first house.  Follow the instructions=
 of the temple priests and everything would be find
