Namaste Sri Rao.
=C2=A0
Thanks for the response with the details on methods=
 and rituals. 
=C2=A0
1. So, does it meant that if one follows a simple con=
tented Dharmic life with Sattva-predominant=C2=A0mind, Deva, Pitri and Rish=
i will be satisfied.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
2. How long one should do service to Manu=
sya and Bhutas? 
=C2=A0
3.=C2=A0In the case of Rituals or Tarpana, as they =
would be performed as Sakama, one needs to follow strict rules and regulati=
ons. Is there any alternate nishkama karma which would provide the same ben=
efits? For example, can one do Japa (108 or 1008) on Gayathri or Ista Devat=
a? Appreciate your guidance.
=C2=A0
Thanks
Ramesh

Nama=

Debts to various beings operate at different levels. They can be repa=
id in many ways. But five different debts and five specific ways to repay h=
ave been identified in scriptures:

(1) Deva rina (debt to divine beings): =
Make offerings in fire to divine beings such as Indra, Agni, Vayu, Surya et=
c, while praying for the strength and happiness of those beings.
(2) Pitri =
rina (debt to ancestral manes): Offer tarpanas through specific chakras (en=
ergy centers) in the palm, while praying for the freedom of ancestors from =
blockages.
(3) Rishi rina (debt to seers): Study Vedas, upanishads, scriptu=
res and wise writings and transform one's thinking and attitude.
(4) Manush=
ya rina (debt to other human beings): Serve others. Offer food, knowledge, =
services etc and serve humanity.
(5) Bhoota rina (debt to other beings): Fe=
ed animals, birds and other beings and take care of them with kindness.

Of=
 course, one can make offerings to rishis in fire or offer tarpanas to rish=
is (if you see the Tarpana manuals at the website below, you'll see section=
s on Deva tarpana and Rishi tarpana!). However, the best way to repay the d=
ebt to seers is to transform one's attitude through study, contemplation an=
d assimilation of knowledge.

We are a microcosm of the entire universe. De=
vas, pitris, rishis, manushyas and bhutas are within us. Devas within us ar=
e happy when undesirable conditioning within us is burnt in the fire of wis=
dom and we are guided by wisdom always. Pitris within us are happy when wea=
knesses and blockages within are flushed and mind becomes contented. Rishis=
 (seers) within us are happy when we have a clear vision of right and wrong=
. The corresponding rituals and practices try to bring the required interna=
l changes through resonance.

Pitri tarpana is a very simple ritual. Find t=
he manuals at the website below. It is ideal for repaying the debts to pitr=
is. While doing the ritual, sincerely pray that your ancestors stuck due to=
 desires be freed from the desires, so they can move on.

Best regards,
Nar=
asimha
