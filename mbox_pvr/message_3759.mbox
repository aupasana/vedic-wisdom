Dear All,
=C2=A0
Please find some more such insightful information on Chand=
i Path / Devi Mahatyam by Sro Swami Krishnananda @ http://www.sivanandadlsh=
q.org/religions/devi_mahatmya.htm
=C2=A0
Some Excerts below"
=C2=A0

"Now, =
this Devi-Mahatmya is not merely an esoteric Epic. It is not only a great s=
piritual text in the form of occult lessons, occult teachings of which I ha=
ve given you an outline. But, it is also a great Mantra-Sastra. Every sloka=
, every verse of the Devi-Mahatmya is a Mantra by itself. I will tell you h=
ow it is a Mantra, by giving only one instance, that is the first sloka its=
elf. 'Savarnih suryatanayo yo manuh Kathyate-shtamah. This is the first slo=
ka, Savarnih Surya-Tanayah. It is all a Tantric interpretation and a very d=
ifficult thing to understand. But I am giving you only an idea as to what i=
t is all like. Surya represents fire, the fire-principle. 'Surya-Tanaya' me=
ans that which is born of the fire-principle. What is it that is born of th=
e fire-principle? It is the seed 'Ra'. According to Tantric esoteric psycho=
logy, 'Ram' is the Bija Mantra of Agni. In the word Savarnih, 'varni' means=
 a hook; so add one hook to 'Ram'. Yo Manuh Kathyate,
 ashtamah. Eighth let=
ter--What is Manu? It is a letter in Sanskrit. Eight letters are Ya, Ra, La=
, Va, Sya, Sha, Sa, Ha. The eighth is Ha. Add Ha to it. Ha, Ra and one hook=
, make 'Hreem'. Savarnih Suryo-Tanayo Yo Manuh Kathyateshtamah, Nisamaya Ta=
dutpattim,--you hear the glory of that, the sage says. So, the first verse =
means: "Now, I shall describe to you the glory of 'Hreem'." This Hreem is t=
he Bija of Devi. But, outwardly it means, "Listen to the story of the king =
so and so, who is the eighth Manu" and all that. Thus in addition to the ou=
ter meaning, there is an inner significance of the Mantra. I am giving you =
only the case of one Mantra. Like this, every Mantra is full of inner signi=
ficance. And every Mantra is repeated by devotees for some purpose or the o=
ther. Especially, the Devi-Mahatmya is recited for averting calamities in l=
ife. Catastrophies, calamities and tensions, personal or outward, whatever =
they be, all these are averted by a regular
 daily recital of the Devi-Maha=
tmya. When there is war threatening a country, for example, or pestilence o=
r epidemic spreading everywhere, or any internal tension or anxiety of any =
kind, the Devi-Mahatmya is to be studied and it is a very potent remedy pre=
scribed by seers of yore, not only for temporal terrestrial prosperity, but=
 also for the glory of the hereafter, for illumination, for the destruction=
 of Avidya or Ajnana, for overcoming Mala, Vikshepa and Avarana, and to be =
a fit recipient of the grace of the Almighty. Thus is the outer significanc=
e and the inner significance of the Devi-Mahatmya and the special meaning t=
hat it has in the life of spiritual seekers or Sadhakas. Glory to God! Glor=
y to Sadhana! Glory to the integral character of spiritual practice! May we=
 be blessed with this illumination, with this wisdom, with the strength to =
tread the path of the Spirit, to our ultimate Freedom! "

Nam=
aste Nagraj,

All the best on your spiritual endevaours as you embark on le=
arning the Saptashati and eventually performing homam with it. One thing th=
at I thought might be of great use in your journey is a powerful narrative =
from Narasimha on the deeper meaning of the Chandi Saptashati in his inaugu=
ral post to this group. I reproduce it here so that it may help you and the=
 legions of devotees who are performing
or getting ready to perform Chandi =
Homam.

On the surface it seems like a simple story of Mother Goddesses' va=
lour and battlefield exploits over fierce and seemingly unvanquishable demo=
ns. When I first read the Chandi (and I'm not ready yet to perform the homa=
m) I was stricken by self-doubt by what seemed a simplistic narrative - dem=
ons arise and Mother kills them, some more demons arise and Mother conquers=
 them and so on it went...but Narasimhaji' s powerful synthesis of the deep=
er meaning and some other material that I read on Shreema's website dispell=
ed all doubts as to what this extremely potent and powerful text is all abo=
ut. I faithfully reproduce it below (later on I will reproduce some of the =
comments of Satyananda Saraswati from Shreema's ashram on the great Saptash=
ati).

Herewith:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - =
- - - - -

Some people mistakenly think that Chandi Saptashati is merely an=
 account of the exploits of Durgaa and her slaying of demons Mahisha, Chand=
a, Munda, Raktabeeja, Shumbha, Nishumbha etc. They view it as a collection =
of stories. But, IMHO, that is a very limited view. Devi mahatmyam is much =
more than a collection of stories. After all, Vedas are its swaroopam! Rigv=
eda, Yajurveda and Saamaveda are the swaroopam (form/essence/ a different m=
anifestation) of the three parts of Chandi Saptashati. The purpose of Vedas=
 is self-knowledge. How can something with Vedas as its swaroopam be about =
something other than self-knowledge? 

* * *

Though Devi Mahatmyam looks l=
ike stories, there are very valuable lessons on Her nature in it. The deepe=
r you go, the more you can understand and appreciate the lessons in the sto=
ries. Let me give a couple of examples.

(1) When various Mothers are going=
 to war with demons, this is how it is described (8-14): "Whatever form, de=
coration, weapons and vehicle each god has, his shakti (energy) came in the=
 same form, decoration, weapons and vehicle." The next 9 verses describe ho=
w Brahmaani etc came. For example, Brahmaani came on a swan with aksha sutr=
a and kamandalu (worn by Brahma), Maaheswari came on a great bull with a Tr=
ishoola and She wore a big snake and Moon. And so on.

What is the message =
hidden in the above description? The normal imagery painted elsewhere is of=
 female deities with a separate form. Here, they are depicted differently.
=

The fact that these female deities are identical to the male counterparts =
in form, decoration, weapons and vehicles suggests, to me, that they are no=
t really separate from the male counterparts. Brahma and Brahmaani are not =
separate. Maheswara and Maaheswari are not separate. Vishnu and Vaishnavi a=
re not separate. And so on. Brahmaani is simply the shakti (vitality/energy=
) of Brahma. Maaheswari is simply the shakti (vitality/energy) of Maheswara=
. And so on.

If Vaishnavi went on Garuda vehicle and killed a demon, it ac=
tually means that Vishnu went on a Garuda vehicle and killed the demon. Vai=
shanvi is the personification of Vishnu's energy, which makes Vishnu be, th=
ink, desire, move and act. Vaishnavi is not separate from Vishnu.

Of cours=
e, if you imagine Vaishnavi (Lakshmi) as a separate person with certain att=
ributes, She may manifest limited by your imagination and even give you a d=
arshan in that form. However, that is a limited form and Her true nature is=
 beyond that. Her true and highest nature is that She is an inseparable par=
t of Vishnu and represents the energy of Vishnu. She is the part of Vishnu =
that makes Vishnu think, desire, act etc. Vaishnavi is basically Chetana (a=
nimated consciousness) of Vishnu.

Thus, contemplation on these verses will=
 make you understand the true nature of male devatas and female devatas and=
 their relationship better. It will enable you to appreciate the highest na=
ture of Shakti.

Puranas personify everything to make things interesting an=
d understandable by laymen. However, it is more fun to explore the deeper m=
eanings.

(2) Take Raktabeeja's slaying. Raktabeeja is a demon with a speci=
al ability. If a drop of blood falls from his body on the ground, another d=
emon will be born from it and will be of the same size, age and strength as=
 the original Raktabeeja even at birth. As Vaishnavi, Maaheswari, Aindri et=
c were hurting Raktabeeja in the fight, more and more demons were being bor=
n and all the gods were scared. Then Chandikaa told Kaali to expand her fac=
e and eat all the demons as they are born. Chandika goes around the war gro=
und eating all the demons as they are born and eventually Raktabeeja runs o=
ut of blood.

This looks like a nice story. But, is there is a deeper meani=
ng in it that helps you in self-realization? Why was Kaali the chosen one a=
nd not Vaishnavi or Naarasimhi or Aindri?

The word rakta means blood. Anot=
her meaning is "desire/passion" . The word comes from the root ranj/rang, w=
hich means "to color". Desire/passion/ attachment colors and conditions the=
 mind. Beeja means seed.

Raktabeeja means "the seed of desire". Raktabeeja=
 fighting with gods symbolizes desires taking the better of our good judgme=
nt and good qualities. Each human being is a microcosm of the macrocosm tha=
t the universe is. All devatas reside in us as various good qualities and a=
ll demons reside in us as various undesirable qualities. When we are overco=
me by desires and do bad deeds, the Raktabeeja within us is defeating the g=
ods within us.

The thing is that desires are difficult to get rid of. You =
get rid of one desire and another desire is born. That is what Raktabeeja's=
 special ability means. The "seed of desires" (i.e. basic attachment that i=
s the nature of mind) within us will keep producing more and more desires. =
It is very resourceful.

Then, why Kaali to destroy Him?

In astrology, we =
associate Mahaakaala and Mahaakaali with Saturn. Kaali shows detachment and=
 vairaagyam. She wears a garland of skulls, symbolizing that there is an en=
dless cycle (garland) of births a material form (skull) goes thru. The way =
Kaali shows to overcome the cycle is vairaagyam and detachment. She shows m=
eaningful and highest level of vairaagyam that comes with a deep understand=
ing of the cycle of material forms.

To fully cut off the "seed of desires"=
 so that one does not get any more desires, one needs to develop vairaagyam=
 and detachment and keep on destroying desires as they are born and persist=
 like that. After persisting for a long time, the "seed of desires" will ru=
n out of desires and the basic attachment of mind will vanish.

Thus, simpl=
e stories have deep meanings. This particular story celebrates the value of=
 detachment, vairaagyam and persistence - Saturnine qualities.

* * *

Mere=
ly chanting Chandi saptashati without understanding the meaning is also exc=
ellent and produces results. Understanding the meaning and marvelling at th=
e power of the Mother makes one fearless and energetic and also give materi=
al benefits. Understanding the deeper meanings and appreciating the True Na=
ture of the Mother makes one realize one's own true nature. It has various =
benefits at various levels of sadhana. It is tough to exactly say what bene=
fit it gives, as that depends on the evolution level of sadhaka and his att=
itude. But, there is something in Chandipath for everyone!

However, the hi=
ghest purpose is self-knowledge and that is why Vedas are its swaroopam.

*=
 * *

Towards the end, the 11th chapter (titled "Naaraayani Stuti") describ=
es gods praying to the Divine Mother after slaying all the demons. They add=
ress Her as "Naaraayani" . Trimurthis symbolize the purest aspects of the t=
hree gunas. Vishnu is one of them. He is of Sattva guna and sustains the cr=
eation. However, Narayana is different. He is not Vishnu (contrast Narayana=
 sooktam with Vishnu sooktam!). He is gunaateeta (above gunas/attributes) .=
 He is the Sahasraseersha and Parama Purusha (Supreme Cosmic Being). Some p=
eople may validly describe the same as Samba Sada Shiva also, but let us no=
t argue about names. When we are essentially speaking about an entity that =
is beyond attributes, it is foolish to argue about the name. After all, nam=
e too is an attribute that intends to describe other attributes! Though gre=
at people gave different names to Parama Purusha, the names essentially cap=
ture the nature of the *path* those people took to experience the Parama
 P=
urusha rather than the nature of Parama Purusha, which is beyond names and =
attributes.

The bottomline is that there is a Parama Purusha above the Tri=
murthis (Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva). IF we call him Narayana, then Narayani =
is His energy and She is the root cause of all manifested creation.

Saptas=
hati is about Narayani. It is about the inseparable root energy of the Supr=
eme Cosmic Being who is the source of this entire universe. A small part of=
 that root energy lies within us too. Because I said "small part", don't th=
ink it is small. Even a small percentage of infinity is still infinity. Tho=
ugh each of us is a microcosm of the macrocosm that the entire universe is,=
 each of us is a complete and accurate replica of the entire universe. Thin=
k "poornamadah poornamidam" in Vedic spirit! The purpose of all spiritual s=
adhana is realizing the true nature of self. Chandipath can also be viewed =
from that perspective.

------------ --------- --------- --------- --------=

Someone queried a while back on the meaning behind the story of M=
adhu Kaitabha. Here is a quick reply based on my limited understanding.

* =
* *

Madhu means honey. "Madhu keeta" means an insect of honey, i.e. honey =
bee. Madhu kaita means belonging to honey bees. It can be the qualities or =
nature of honey bees. One of the meanings of "bha" is "having a similarity =
to". Thus, in my judgment, "Madhu Kaitabha" means "having a semblance to th=
e nature of honey bees".

* * *

Like I keep saying, Sanskrit is a fantasti=
c language. Sanskrit names selected by Rishis for expressing various concep=
ts and stories are very thoughtful. Depending on how deep one goes, there a=
re many meanings of the same word. Thus, Rishis expressed concepts that may=
 have one meaning to a layman and a different meaning to one who is ready t=
o understand the deeper meaning! I salute to the wisdom of our Rishis!

I w=
as saying the same thing at Arsha Vidya Gurukulam last weekend. When somebo=
dy said at an open discussion that the idea is important and not the name, =
as there are many names of the same thing in many languages, I made a quick=
 point about the value of Sanskrit names. I said that Sanskrit names have n=
ot one meaning, but layers of meanings that can be understood based on the =
capability of the reader. Rishis used this to hide some special meanings an=
d to keep some higher knowledge as secret, even though it is very much out =
there! The example I gave was of bhava and pada. Parasara described bhavas =
(houses) and how to find their respective padas (arudha padas of houses) an=
d said that a bhava and its pada should be judged to see the matters of a h=
ouse. Though he did not explain the difference between a bhava and its pada=
 further and did not elucidate when to use which one, I said that the very =
choice of names is a huge clue! Bhava, which is usually
 translated as a ho=
use, also means "a thought/concept/ feeling" and pada means "a symbol/word"=
 used to express a thought/concept. Thus, houses are to their arudha padas =
what thoughts (bhavas) are to the words (padas) that attempt to express the=
m. For example, if the 4th house shows one's happiness from vehicles, the p=
ada of 4th house shows the tangible articles that attempt to throw light on=
 one's happiness from vehicles (e.g. the physical vehicle owned by one). Ho=
uses (bhavas) show intangible/internal aspects of a matter (just like thoug=
hts inside one's head), while their arudha padas show tangible/external asp=
ects of a matter (just like the external words spoken that attempt to expre=
ss the thoughts in the head). If you use the English words to translate Par=
asara, this hidden meaning may be lost! So, I argued that Sanskrit names us=
ed by Rishis are not like words in any language.

* * *

Anyway, let us com=
e back to the Madhu Kaitabha story. As I said, Madhu Kaitabha means "having=
 a semblance to the quality of honeybees". What is the quality of honey bee=
s? Well, they keep working hard to accumulate the sweet honey! They are not=
 intelligent enough to think about any higher things in life. Thus, Madhu K=
aitabha are an allegory to the quality within us which makes us work hard, =
like honeybees, with a single-minded focus on accumulating material comfort=
s. Like honeybees accumulate honey, we accumulate material objects and spen=
d whole life working hard doing just that.

Vishnu is a personification of =
the sattwa guna of the Parama Purusha (Universal/Absolute Being). Within us=
, Vishnu is an allegory to the sattwa guna within us. Madhu Kaitabha were b=
orn from Vishnu's earwax when He was alseep. The ability to work hard like =
a bee is not really a terrible thing. This ability is essentially born from=
 the sattwa guna within us, when it is in deep slumber (i.e. sattwa guna co=
vered by taamasi shakti, i.e. sattwa guna that "manifests" in a taamasik wa=
y).

There are so many good people in this world, who just spend their enti=
re lives in honest labor like the honeybees and accumulate things for thems=
elves and others around them. Their sattwa is in deep sleep and Madhu Kaita=
bha born from that asleep sattva are very much active.

The problem with th=
is focus on hard work and accumulation of material objects is that it keeps=
 us away from supreme bliss. Madhu Kaitabha's attack on Brahma and Vedas is=
 symbolic of that. Vedas symbolize the supreme and liberating knowledge of =
self and Brahma, the carrier of Vedas, symbolizes the sadhana to achieve th=
e supreme knowledge. The focus on working like honeybees and accumulating m=
aterial objects tries to kills one's ability to do sadhana and obtain supre=
me knowledge of self.

Vishnu battles Madhu Kaitabha for 5,000 years. Devi =
Bhagavatam even describes that Vishnu wondered in the middle how to defeat =
Madhu Kaitabha, as He finds them quite formidable! Even when the sattva in =
us awakens, it is difficult for it to overcome the formidable instinct to l=
ead the life of a honeybee and to accumulate the material objects for onese=
lf and others.

According to Parasara, thighs are seen from the 9th house o=
f dharma. The earthy element symbolizes the commitment and stability. The f=
act that earthy element came from the thighs of Vishnu shows that it is the=
 dharma of sattwa guna sustaining this universe that ensures that there is =
commitment and stability in this creation.

Moreover, it is apt that someon=
e born in the ears (3rd house) of Vishnu found end in the thighs (9th house=
, i.e. 7th house of death from the 3rd house) of Vishnu! Similarly, Brahma,=
 who is born from the navel (6th house) of Vishnu should naturally find His=
 end in the 12th house of Vishnu (feet/sleep) , which is the 7th house of d=
eath from the 6th house! That may be why Vishnu goes to sleep, when there i=
s a change of Brahma.

Anyway, the instinct within us to keep accumulating =
material objects like honey bees accumulate honey finds its end in the dhar=
ma of the sattwa guna, i.e. when the sattwa guna within us follows its dhar=
ma. Then we are fully awake spiritually. Naturally, the path to self-knowle=
dge becomes open then and Brahma becomes elated.

Thus, the story of Madhu-=
Kaitabha refers, allegorically, to the instinct most of us have towards lea=
ding a "regular" life, working hard like honeybees and accumulating objects=
 for self and others and how that instinct needs to be defeated by waking u=
p the sattwa guna and allowing it to perform its dharma.

* * *

Lest I am =
misunderstood, I need to clarify one thing. I am not saying that these stor=
ies are not real. These stories ARE very much real. In fact, when a Yogi is=
 able to transport consciousness (Kundalini) to a particular plane (chakra)=
, He/She can vividly see these stories actually happening. The stories are =
as real as our own existence as beings made of flesh and blood is, in the n=
ormal plane of consciousness.

What I am saying is that there is an allegor=
ical link between various planes of consciousness. What is real in one plan=
e of consciousness is an allegory in another plane of consciousness. If one=
 is atleast capable of understanding a story as an allegory, that will serv=
e a valuable purpose!

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Some Excerts below"</DIV>
<DIV>=
 </DIV>
<DIV>
<DIV>"Now, this Devi-Mahatmya is not merely an esoteric =
Epic. It is not only a great spiritual text in the form of occult lessons, =
occult teachings of which I have given you an outline. But, it is also a gr=
eat <I>Mantra-Sastra</I>. Every <I>sloka</I>, every verse of the Devi-Mahat=
mya is a Mantra by itself. I will tell you how it is a Mantra, by giving on=
ly one instance, that is the first sloka itself. <I>'Savarnih suryatanayo y=
o manuh Kathyate-shtamah</I>. This is the first sloka, <I>Savarnih Surya-Ta=
nayah</I>. It is all a Tantric interpretation and a very difficult thing to=
 understand. But I am giving you only an idea as to what it is all like. <I=
>Surya</I> represents fire, the fire-principle. <I>'Surya-Tanaya'</I> means=
 that which is born of the fire-principle. What is it that is born of the f=
ire-principle? It is the seed <I>'Ra'</I>. According to Tantric esoteric ps=
ychology, <I>'Ram'</I> is the Bija Mantra of Agni. In the word <I>Savarnih,=
 'varni'</I>
 means a hook; so add one hook to <I>'Ram'. Yo Manuh Kathyate,=
 ashtamah</I>. Eighth letter--What is <I>Manu</I>? It is a letter in Sanskr=
it. Eight letters are <I>Ya, Ra, La, Va, Sya, Sha, Sa, Ha</I>. The eighth i=
s <I>Ha</I>. Add Ha to it. <I>Ha, Ra</I> and one hook, make <I>'Hreem'</I>.=
 <I>Savarnih Suryo-Tanayo Yo Manuh Kathyateshtamah, Nisamaya Tadutpattim</I=
>,--you hear the glory of that, the sage says. So, the first verse means: "=
Now, I shall describe to you the glory of <I>'Hreem'</I>." This <I>Hreem</I=
> is the Bija of Devi. But, outwardly it means, "Listen to the story of the=
 king so and so, who is the eighth Manu" and all that. Thus in addition to =
the outer meaning, there is an inner significance of the Mantra. I am givin=
g you only the case of one Mantra. Like this, every Mantra is full of inner=
 significance. And every Mantra is repeated by devotees for some purpose or=
 the other. Especially, the Devi-Mahatmya is recited for averting calamitie=
s in
 life. Catastrophies, calamities and tensions, personal or outward, wh=
atever they be, all these are averted by a regular daily recital of the Dev=
i-Mahatmya. When there is war threatening a country, for example, or pestil=
ence or epidemic spreading everywhere, or any internal tension or anxiety o=
f any kind, the Devi-Mahatmya is to be studied and it is a very potent reme=
dy prescribed by seers of yore, not only for temporal terrestrial prosperit=
y, but also for the glory of the hereafter, for illumination, for the destr=
uction of <I>Avidya</I> or <I>Ajnana</I>, for overcoming <I>Mala, Vikshepa<=
/I> and <I>Avarana</I>, and to be a fit recipient of the grace of the Almig=
hty. Thus is the outer significance and the inner significance of the Devi-=
Mahatmya and the special meaning that it has in the life of spiritual seeke=
rs or Sadhakas. Glory to God! Glory to Sadhana! Glory to the integral chara=
cter of spiritual practice! May we be blessed with this illumination,
 with=
 this wisdom, with the strength to tread the path of the Spirit, to our ult=
imate Freedom! "</DIV></DIV><BR><BR>--- On <B>Sun, 2/21/10, alokbhat <I><=

<DIV>Namaste Nagraj,<BR><BR>=
All the best on your spiritual endevaours as you embark on learning the Sap=
tashati and eventually performing homam with it. One thing that I thought m=
ight be of great use in your journey is a powerful narrative from Narasimha=
 on the deeper meaning of the Chandi Saptashati in his inaugural post to th=
is group. I reproduce it here so that it may help you and the legions of de=
votees who are performing<BR>or getting ready to perform Chandi Homam.<BR><=
BR>On the surface it seems like a simple story of Mother Goddesses' valour =
and battlefield exploits over fierce and seemingly unvanquishable demons. W=
hen I first read the Chandi (and I'm not ready yet to perform the homam) I =
was stricken by self-doubt by what seemed a simplistic narrative - demons a=
rise and Mother kills them, some more demons arise and Mother conquers them=
 and so on it went...but Narasimhaji' s powerful synthesis of the deeper me=
aning and some other material that I
 read on Shreema's website dispelled a=
ll doubts as to what this extremely potent and powerful text is all about. =
I faithfully reproduce it below (later on I will reproduce some of the comm=
ents of Satyananda Saraswati from Shreema's ashram on the great Saptashati)=
.<BR><BR>Herewith:<BR>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -=
 - - - - - - -<BR><BR>Some people mistakenly think that Chandi Saptashati i=
s merely an account of the exploits of Durgaa and her slaying of demons Mah=
isha, Chanda, Munda, Raktabeeja, Shumbha, Nishumbha etc. They view it as a =
collection of stories. But, IMHO, that is a very limited view. Devi mahatmy=
am is much more than a collection of stories. After all, Vedas are its swar=
oopam! Rigveda, Yajurveda and Saamaveda are the swaroopam (form/essence/ a =
different manifestation) of the three parts of Chandi Saptashati. The purpo=
se of Vedas is self-knowledge. How can something with Vedas as its swaroopa=
m be about something other
 than self-knowledge? <BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Thoug=
h Devi Mahatmyam looks like stories, there are very valuable lessons on Her=
 nature in it. The deeper you go, the more you can understand and appreciat=
e the lessons in the stories. Let me give a couple of examples.<BR><BR>(1) =
When various Mothers are going to war with demons, this is how it is descri=
bed (8-14): "Whatever form, decoration, weapons and vehicle each god has, h=
is shakti (energy) came in the same form, decoration, weapons and vehicle."=
 The next 9 verses describe how Brahmaani etc came. For example, Brahmaani =
came on a swan with aksha sutra and kamandalu (worn by Brahma), Maaheswari =
came on a great bull with a Trishoola and She wore a big snake and Moon. An=
d so on.<BR><BR>What is the message hidden in the above description? The no=
rmal imagery painted elsewhere is of female deities with a separate form. H=
ere, they are depicted differently.<BR><BR>The fact that these female deiti=
es are identical to
 the male counterparts in form, decoration, weapons and=
 vehicles suggests, to me, that they are not really separate from the male =
counterparts. Brahma and Brahmaani are not separate. Maheswara and Maaheswa=
ri are not separate. Vishnu and Vaishnavi are not separate. And so on. Brah=
maani is simply the shakti (vitality/energy) of Brahma. Maaheswari is simpl=
y the shakti (vitality/energy) of Maheswara. And so on.<BR><BR>If Vaishnavi=
 went on Garuda vehicle and killed a demon, it actually means that Vishnu w=
ent on a Garuda vehicle and killed the demon. Vaishanvi is the personificat=
ion of Vishnu's energy, which makes Vishnu be, think, desire, move and act.=
 Vaishnavi is not separate from Vishnu.<BR><BR>Of course, if you imagine Va=
ishnavi (Lakshmi) as a separate person with certain attributes, She may man=
ifest limited by your imagination and even give you a darshan in that form.=
 However, that is a limited form and Her true nature is beyond that. Her tr=
ue and
 highest nature is that She is an inseparable part of Vishnu and rep=
resents the energy of Vishnu. She is the part of Vishnu that makes Vishnu t=
hink, desire, act etc. Vaishnavi is basically Chetana (animated consciousne=
ss) of Vishnu.<BR><BR>Thus, contemplation on these verses will make you und=
erstand the true nature of male devatas and female devatas and their relati=
onship better. It will enable you to appreciate the highest nature of Shakt=
i.<BR><BR>Puranas personify everything to make things interesting and under=
standable by laymen. However, it is more fun to explore the deeper meanings=
.<BR><BR>(2) Take Raktabeeja's slaying. Raktabeeja is a demon with a specia=
l ability. If a drop of blood falls from his body on the ground, another de=
mon will be born from it and will be of the same size, age and strength as =
the original Raktabeeja even at birth. As Vaishnavi, Maaheswari, Aindri etc=
 were hurting Raktabeeja in the fight, more and more demons were being born=

 and all the gods were scared. Then Chandikaa told Kaali to expand her fac=
e and eat all the demons as they are born. Chandika goes around the war gro=
und eating all the demons as they are born and eventually Raktabeeja runs o=
ut of blood.<BR><BR>This looks like a nice story. But, is there is a deeper=
 meaning in it that helps you in self-realization? Why was Kaali the chosen=
 one and not Vaishnavi or Naarasimhi or Aindri?<BR><BR>The word rakta means=
 blood. Another meaning is "desire/passion" . The word comes from the root =
ranj/rang, which means "to color". Desire/passion/ attachment colors and co=
nditions the mind. Beeja means seed.<BR><BR>Raktabeeja means "the seed of d=
esire". Raktabeeja fighting with gods symbolizes desires taking the better =
of our good judgment and good qualities. Each human being is a microcosm of=
 the macrocosm that the universe is. All devatas reside in us as various go=
od qualities and all demons reside in us as various undesirable
 qualities.=
 When we are overcome by desires and do bad deeds, the Raktabeeja within us=
 is defeating the gods within us.<BR><BR>The thing is that desires are diff=
icult to get rid of. You get rid of one desire and another desire is born. =
That is what Raktabeeja's special ability means. The "seed of desires" (i.e=
. basic attachment that is the nature of mind) within us will keep producin=
g more and more desires. It is very resourceful.<BR><BR>Then, why Kaali to =
destroy Him?<BR><BR>In astrology, we associate Mahaakaala and Mahaakaali wi=
th Saturn. Kaali shows detachment and vairaagyam. She wears a garland of sk=
ulls, symbolizing that there is an endless cycle (garland) of births a mate=
rial form (skull) goes thru. The way Kaali shows to overcome the cycle is v=
airaagyam and detachment. She shows meaningful and highest level of vairaag=
yam that comes with a deep understanding of the cycle of material forms.<BR=
><BR>To fully cut off the "seed of desires" so that one
 does not get any m=
ore desires, one needs to develop vairaagyam and detachment and keep on des=
troying desires as they are born and persist like that. After persisting fo=
r a long time, the "seed of desires" will run out of desires and the basic =
attachment of mind will vanish.<BR><BR>Thus, simple stories have deep meani=
ngs. This particular story celebrates the value of detachment, vairaagyam a=
nd persistence - Saturnine qualities.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Merely chanting C=
handi saptashati without understanding the meaning is also excellent and pr=
oduces results. Understanding the meaning and marvelling at the power of th=
e Mother makes one fearless and energetic and also give material benefits. =
Understanding the deeper meanings and appreciating the True Nature of the M=
other makes one realize one's own true nature. It has various benefits at v=
arious levels of sadhana. It is tough to exactly say what benefit it gives,=
 as that depends on the evolution level of
 sadhaka and his attitude. But, =
there is something in Chandipath for everyone!<BR><BR>However, the highest =
purpose is self-knowledge and that is why Vedas are its swaroopam.<BR><BR>*=
 * *<BR><BR>Towards the end, the 11th chapter (titled "Naaraayani Stuti") d=
escribes gods praying to the Divine Mother after slaying all the demons. Th=
ey address Her as "Naaraayani" . Trimurthis symbolize the purest aspects of=
 the three gunas. Vishnu is one of them. He is of Sattva guna and sustains =
the creation. However, Narayana is different. He is not Vishnu (contrast Na=
rayana sooktam with Vishnu sooktam!). He is gunaateeta (above gunas/attribu=
tes) . He is the Sahasraseersha and Parama Purusha (Supreme Cosmic Being). =
Some people may validly describe the same as Samba Sada Shiva also, but let=
 us not argue about names. When we are essentially speaking about an entity=
 that is beyond attributes, it is foolish to argue about the name. After al=
l, name too is an attribute that
 intends to describe other attributes! Tho=
ugh great people gave different names to Parama Purusha, the names essentia=
lly capture the nature of the *path* those people took to experience the Pa=
rama Purusha rather than the nature of Parama Purusha, which is beyond name=
s and attributes.<BR><BR>The bottomline is that there is a Parama Purusha a=
bove the Trimurthis (Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva). IF we call him Narayana, th=
en Narayani is His energy and She is the root cause of all manifested creat=
ion.<BR><BR>Saptashati is about Narayani. It is about the inseparable root =
energy of the Supreme Cosmic Being who is the source of this entire univers=
e. A small part of that root energy lies within us too. Because I said "sma=
ll part", don't think it is small. Even a small percentage of infinity is s=
till infinity. Though each of us is a microcosm of the macrocosm that the e=
ntire universe is, each of us is a complete and accurate replica of the ent=
ire universe. Think
 "poornamadah poornamidam" in Vedic spirit! The purpose=
 of all spiritual sadhana is realizing the true nature of self. Chandipath =
can also be viewed from that perspective.<BR><BR>------------ --------- ---=
------ --------- --------- -----<BR><BR><BR>Someone queried a while back on=
 the meaning behind the story of Madhu Kaitabha. Here is a quick reply base=
d on my limited understanding.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Madhu means honey. "Madh=
u keeta" means an insect of honey, i.e. honey bee. Madhu kaita means belong=
ing to honey bees. It can be the qualities or nature of honey bees. One of =
the meanings of "bha" is "having a similarity to". Thus, in my judgment, "M=
adhu Kaitabha" means "having a semblance to the nature of honey bees".<BR><=
BR>* * *<BR><BR>Like I keep saying, Sanskrit is a fantastic language. Sansk=
rit names selected by Rishis for expressing various concepts and stories ar=
e very thoughtful. Depending on how deep one goes, there are many meanings =
of the same
 word. Thus, Rishis expressed concepts that may have one meanin=
g to a layman and a different meaning to one who is ready to understand the=
 deeper meaning! I salute to the wisdom of our Rishis!<BR><BR>I was saying =
the same thing at Arsha Vidya Gurukulam last weekend. When somebody said at=
 an open discussion that the idea is important and not the name, as there a=
re many names of the same thing in many languages, I made a quick point abo=
ut the value of Sanskrit names. I said that Sanskrit names have not one mea=
ning, but layers of meanings that can be understood based on the capability=
 of the reader. Rishis used this to hide some special meanings and to keep =
some higher knowledge as secret, even though it is very much out there! The=
 example I gave was of bhava and pada. Parasara described bhavas (houses) a=
nd how to find their respective padas (arudha padas of houses) and said tha=
t a bhava and its pada should be judged to see the matters of a house. Thou=
gh he
 did not explain the difference between a bhava and its pada further =
and did not elucidate when to use which one, I said that the very choice of=
 names is a huge clue! Bhava, which is usually translated as a house, also =
means "a thought/concept/ feeling" and pada means "a symbol/word" used to e=
xpress a thought/concept. Thus, houses are to their arudha padas what thoug=
hts (bhavas) are to the words (padas) that attempt to express them. For exa=
mple, if the 4th house shows one's happiness from vehicles, the pada of 4th=
 house shows the tangible articles that attempt to throw light on one's hap=
piness from vehicles (e.g. the physical vehicle owned by one). Houses (bhav=
as) show intangible/internal aspects of a matter (just like thoughts inside=
 one's head), while their arudha padas show tangible/external aspects of a =
matter (just like the external words spoken that attempt to express the tho=
ughts in the head). If you use the English words to translate Parasara,
 th=
is hidden meaning may be lost! So, I argued that Sanskrit names used by Ris=
his are not like words in any language.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Anyway, let us =
come back to the Madhu Kaitabha story. As I said, Madhu Kaitabha means "hav=
ing a semblance to the quality of honeybees". What is the quality of honey =
bees? Well, they keep working hard to accumulate the sweet honey! They are =
not intelligent enough to think about any higher things in life. Thus, Madh=
u Kaitabha are an allegory to the quality within us which makes us work har=
d, like honeybees, with a single-minded focus on accumulating material comf=
orts. Like honeybees accumulate honey, we accumulate material objects and s=
pend whole life working hard doing just that.<BR><BR>Vishnu is a personific=
ation of the sattwa guna of the Parama Purusha (Universal/Absolute Being). =
Within us, Vishnu is an allegory to the sattwa guna within us. Madhu Kaitab=
ha were born from Vishnu's earwax when He was alseep. The ability
 to work =
hard like a bee is not really a terrible thing. This ability is essentially=
 born from the sattwa guna within us, when it is in deep slumber (i.e. satt=
wa guna covered by taamasi shakti, i.e. sattwa guna that "manifests" in a t=
aamasik way).<BR><BR>There are so many good people in this world, who just =
spend their entire lives in honest labor like the honeybees and accumulate =
things for themselves and others around them. Their sattwa is in deep sleep=
 and Madhu Kaitabha born from that asleep sattva are very much active.<BR><=
BR>The problem with this focus on hard work and accumulation of material ob=
jects is that it keeps us away from supreme bliss. Madhu Kaitabha's attack =
on Brahma and Vedas is symbolic of that. Vedas symbolize the supreme and li=
berating knowledge of self and Brahma, the carrier of Vedas, symbolizes the=
 sadhana to achieve the supreme knowledge. The focus on working like honeyb=
ees and accumulating material objects tries to kills one's
 ability to do s=
adhana and obtain supreme knowledge of self.<BR><BR>Vishnu battles Madhu Ka=
itabha for 5,000 years. Devi Bhagavatam even describes that Vishnu wondered=
 in the middle how to defeat Madhu Kaitabha, as He finds them quite formida=
ble! Even when the sattva in us awakens, it is difficult for it to overcome=
 the formidable instinct to lead the life of a honeybee and to accumulate t=
he material objects for oneself and others.<BR><BR>According to Parasara, t=
highs are seen from the 9th house of dharma. The earthy element symbolizes =
the commitment and stability. The fact that earthy element came from the th=
ighs of Vishnu shows that it is the dharma of sattwa guna sustaining this u=
niverse that ensures that there is commitment and stability in this creatio=
n.<BR><BR>Moreover, it is apt that someone born in the ears (3rd house) of =
Vishnu found end in the thighs (9th house, i.e. 7th house of death from the=
 3rd house) of Vishnu! Similarly, Brahma, who is
 born from the navel (6th =
house) of Vishnu should naturally find His end in the 12th house of Vishnu =
(feet/sleep) , which is the 7th house of death from the 6th house! That may=
 be why Vishnu goes to sleep, when there is a change of Brahma.<BR><BR>Anyw=
ay, the instinct within us to keep accumulating material objects like honey=
 bees accumulate honey finds its end in the dharma of the sattwa guna, i.e.=
 when the sattwa guna within us follows its dharma. Then we are fully awake=
 spiritually. Naturally, the path to self-knowledge becomes open then and B=
rahma becomes elated.<BR><BR>Thus, the story of Madhu-Kaitabha refers, alle=
gorically, to the instinct most of us have towards leading a "regular" life=
, working hard like honeybees and accumulating objects for self and others =
and how that instinct needs to be defeated by waking up the sattwa guna and=
 allowing it to perform its dharma.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>Lest I am misunders=
tood, I need to clarify one thing. I am
 not saying that these stories are =
not real. These stories ARE very much real. In fact, when a Yogi is able to=
 transport consciousness (Kundalini) to a particular plane (chakra), He/She=
 can vividly see these stories actually happening. The stories are as real =
as our own existence as beings made of flesh and blood is, in the normal pl=
ane of consciousness.<BR><BR>What I am saying is that there is an allegoric=
al link between various planes of consciousness. What is real in one plane =
of consciousness is an allegory in another plane of consciousness. If one i=
s atleast capable of understanding a story as an allegory, that will serve =
a valuable purpose!<BR><BR><BR>--- In <A href=3D"http://us.mc504.mail.yahoo=

11:51 PM<BR>> <BR>> Dear Sri Narasimharao garu,<BR>> <BR>> I am=
 very much in
 awe after I learnt that you do chandi homam everyday. You al=
so wrote that it takes about 1.25 hours to 1.5 hours to do your chandi homa=
m. How can you accomplish that feat with 700 ahutis in such a short time? A=
lso, in my case, I do sandhyavandanam with 108 Gayatri (20 minutes)+ganapat=
hi mantra japam 108 times(10 minutes), a short rudra Abhishekam with pachak=
shari, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 minutes) totalling to about 35 - 40 minute=
s daily ritual. Plus I sometimes do special rituals several times a week, t=
hat takes about 1 to 1.5 hours in all. How to integrate these along with ho=
mam? Is Sri vidyopasana different from Chandi homam? Could you please expla=
in what is sri Vidya and how it is to be learnt? I am very motivated to lea=
rn what the Devi Mahatmayam is all about but I also have keen interest in S=
ri Vidya, because I am a musician also and learnt all the nava-avarna krith=
is of Great Muththuswami Dikshitar recently.<BR>> <BR>> Nagraj
