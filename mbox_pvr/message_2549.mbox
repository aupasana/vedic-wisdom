 RE: [sohamsa] Spiritual sadhana (Re: Ramakrishna, Shiva...)


Dear Narasim=
ha, Sanjay and others

Ganesha. Why should one worship Ganesha or Rudra or =
Chandika or Mahakala.
In fact can anybody actually worship any deity.

1. T=
he fact of the matter is that one's mind will be drawn to the worship of de=
ities which one has worshipped in past lives.
2. But, whether one will achi=
ve or not with that aspect of the divine is based on 
  a. What is the resi=
due of karmas which one has left? Karana Shareera basically is responsible =
for this.One in a million 
      individuals will achieve the burning of th=
e Karana Shareera. But when this is being done, then every karma done to th=
at person
     to his body or mind, good or bad must have an almost hundred=
 times more intensity result, like for like.
     
  b. What is the intensi=
ty of the desire of that person for the Divine Beloved?
      Which again b=
oils down to the amount of karmas left in that Karana Shareera. The thicker=
 the overlay of karmas, the lesser the  desire to actually perform any kind=
 of worship.

People talk about mantras, mahamantras, and all this.
I find =
that it simply does not matter. 
Every mantra is a name (nam), every nam ha=
s a form (rupa).
So, when the mantra is chanted, the rupa is forming.
Where=
 is the rupa forming?
In the physical body, mind, koshas and everywhere.
So=
 the deity will actually occupy the person.
But when can this happen?
Only =
when the body is dead. Not dead physically, but in a different sense.
ie. A=
SANA: the mind forgets the body exists after a few hours of sitting really =
still for a few hours a day.
    Pranayana: the mind reflects on the breath=
 and feels it is alive, it tries to still the breath.
    Dhyana, the rupa =
of the deity forms in the mind, remember the body is dead for the mind at t=
his stage.
    Dharana: The mind percieves that form of God which is the ob=
ject of the consciousness, but duality exists.
    Pratyahara: a phenomenon=
 where the eyes do not see, the ears do not hear. 
    Samadhi: the rupa is=
 so well established, that the ultimate form of that rupa, that mantra, the=
 Nirguna manifests.

So the emptiness must come about in the mind and body =
about one's own identity before God fills it up with His form.
So, mantra i=
s simply a tool to make us realise God. Anybody can do mantras, but most pe=
ople's internal fire or Agni is 
not really charged up to digest these.
Jap=
a is no doubt great, but it is involved with the purification of air, where=
as fire is involved in the purification of internal fire.
When internal fir=
e is purified, then the ability to visualise your deity becomes stronger. H=
ence homam in this age is easy and moreover, Agni is a living God, pratyaks=
ha Devata who can be seen by your physical eyes.
It moves, eats, talks with=
 the sadhaka and finally when it dies, it continues to live on within the s=
adhaka.
In Kali Yuga, this ability to call a living God into the house is s=
o powerful and so exhalting that later on japa after homam
brings very fast=
 results.
Why Ganesha? Most people do not want spirituality, and in any cas=
e are not destined to be spiritual in this lifetime, so the only way they w=
ill pursue some sadhana is if they are given some material result quite qui=
ckly by their sadhana.
Those who have problems in career, litigation, probl=
ems with marriage or in finding life partner, problems with education or sp=
eech can really advance their mundane satisfaction with Ganapati homa.
I ha=
ve seen this numerous times myself with people who are in this movement and=
 outside.
That is not to say that Ganapati can't give Mukti. The ultimate f=
orm of Ganapati is the word of God.
And He is sakshama in giving Mukti as w=
ell.

The mahamantras are many and I agree that some may say that lets do t=
his(mahamantras) first.
BUT,
The Vedic mahamantras require the kind of into=
nation so perfect with visualisation at different bits of the body with var=
ious syllables, that for most people this is not feasible, especially since=
 their Sanskrit itself is somewhat imperfect.(remember name is form, if nam=
e is not repeated properly then how will the form be?)(example, of someone =
who repeated bhakshati for rakshati in Pune many years ago).
And then there=
 are mahamantras which are ok with almost any intonation. If someone wants =
to follow this that is also ok.
But, with any mantra sadhana, Ganesha sadha=
na is anivarya. Because, the entrance to Shakti at Sushumna is guarded by H=
im.

Again some doubt comes into people's heads about some mantras harming =
them when recited:
If somebody experiences bad things when a mantra of a ce=
rtain deity is recited then all it means is that the karmas of the Karana s=
hareera are being dealt with(by the deity) quite fast, so they have to be e=
xperienced. It actually means that the Devata is close and more intense sad=
hana is needed. 

Actually, all this business about mantra and mahamantra i=
s immaterial, Allah malik Hai, voh sab janta hai.
Us parvardigar se prartha=
na kar, woh sab raste khol deta hai.
  

With humility
Manish

  Namaste,

  Yes, mahamantra is unbelievably pure =
and eventually purifies one who chants it everyday (ideally, 16x108 times o=
r more).


  > all mantra and puj=C3=84=C2  have many flaws


  Flaw is not=
 in mantra, but in the mind. Each mantra protects the mind. The mechanism o=
f this protection may or may not work fast depending on how impure and flaw=
ed a particular *mind* is.

  Agni (fire) is called paavaka, i.e. the purif=
ier. He is not only the one who is pure, but also the one who *purifies*. W=
hen he is used as the medium for offering mantras, he purifies the mind, it=
s surroundings and the delivery of the mantra. When Parasara taught various=
 remedies in BPHS, he mentioned homam everywhere, for every problem. If you=
 are not pure, take help of the one who is not only pure but also purifies =
whatever he comes in contact with!

  One who spends 30 minutes or more eve=
ryday in any homam will know the effect of fire on mind and can appreciate =
why fire is called "the purifier" and why Parasara mentioned homam in prett=
y much every remedy.

Ganapathi homam is the best homam for anybody to start with. As a spiritual=
 sadhana, it is a good idea to do Ganapathi homam for a few months before s=
tarting any other homam. Ganapathi controls the mooladhara chakra, as well =

 However, there are many exampsles like Sarada Mata, Ramana Maharshi, Swami=

 (Re: Ramakrishna, 
Shiva...)</DIV></DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>Dear Narasim=
ha, Sanjay and others</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Ganesha. Why should one =
worship Ganesha or Rudra or Chandika or 
Mahakala.</DIV>
<DIV>In fact can a=
nybody actually worship any deity.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>1. The fact=
 of the matter is that one's mind will be drawn to the worship 
of deities =
which one has worshipped in past lives.</DIV>
<DIV>2. But, whether one will=
 achive or not with that aspect of the divine is 
based on </DIV>
<DIV>&nbs=
p; a. What is the residue of karmas which one has left? Karana Shareera 
ba=
sically is responsible for this.One in a million </DIV>
<DIV>  &n=
bsp;   individuals will achieve the burning of 
the Karana S=
hareera. But when this is being done, then every karma 
done to t=
hat person</DIV>
<DIV>     to his body or mind, good or=
 bad must have an 
almost hundred times more intensity result, like for lik=
e.</DIV>
<DIV>     </DIV>
<DIV>  b. What is t=
he intensity of the desire of that person for the Divine 
Beloved?</DIV>
<D=
IV>      Which again boils down to the amount of 
=
karmas left in that Karana Shareera. The thicker the overlay of karmas, the=
 
lesser the  desire to actually perform any kind of worship.</DIV>
<D=
IV> </DIV>
<DIV>People talk about mantras, mahamantras, and all this.<=
/DIV>
<DIV>I find that it simply does not matter. </DIV>
<DIV>Every mantra =
is a name (nam), every nam has a form (rupa).</DIV>
<DIV>So, when the mantr=
a is chanted, the rupa is forming.</DIV>
<DIV>Where is the rupa forming?</D=
IV>
<DIV>In the physical body, mind, koshas and everywhere.</DIV>
<DIV>So t=
he deity will actually occupy the person.</DIV>
<DIV>But when can this=
 happen?</DIV>
<DIV>Only when the body is dead. Not dead physically, b=
ut in a different 
sense.</DIV>
<DIV>ie. ASANA: the mind forgets the body e=
xists after a few hours of sitting 
really still for a few hours a day.</DI=
V>
<DIV>    Pranayana: the mind reflects on the breath and f=
eels it 
is alive, it tries to still the breath.</DIV>
<DIV>  &nb=
sp; Dhyana, the rupa of the deity forms in the mind, 
remember the body is =
dead for the mind at this stage.</DIV>
<DIV>    Dharana: The=
 mind percieves that form of God which is 
the object of the consciousness,=
 but duality exists.</DIV>
<DIV>    Pratyahara: a phenomenon=
 where the eyes do not see, the 
ears do not hear. </DIV>
<DIV>  =
  Samadhi: the rupa is so well established, that the 
ultimate form of=
 that rupa, that mantra, the Nirguna manifests.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DI=
V>So the emptiness must come about in the mind and body about one's own 
id=
entity before God fills it up with His form.</DIV>
<DIV>So, mantra is simpl=
y a tool to make us realise God. Anybody can do mantras, 
but most people's=
 internal fire or Agni is </DIV>
<DIV>not really charged up to digest these=
.</DIV>
<DIV>Japa is no doubt great, but it is involved with the purificati=
on of air, 
whereas fire is involved in the purification of internal fire.<=
/DIV>
<DIV>When internal fire is purified, then the ability to visualise yo=
ur deity 
becomes stronger. Hence homam in this age is easy and moreover, A=
gni is a living 
God, pratyaksha Devata who can be seen by your physical ey=
es.</DIV>
<DIV>It moves, eats, talks with the sadhaka and finally when it d=
ies, it 
continues to live on within the sadhaka.</DIV>
<DIV>In Kali Y=
uga, this ability to call a living God into the house is so 
powerful and s=
o exhalting that later on japa after homam</DIV>
<DIV>brings very fast resu=
lts.</DIV>
<DIV>Why Ganesha? Most people do not want spirituality, and in a=
ny case are not 
destined to be spiritual in this lifetime, so the only way=
 they will pursue some 
sadhana is if they are given some material result q=
uite quickly by their 
sadhana.</DIV>
<DIV>Those who have problems in caree=
r, litigation, problems with marriage or in 
finding life partner, problems=
 with education or speech can really advance their 
mundane satisfaction wi=
th Ganapati homa.</DIV>
<DIV>I have seen this numerous times myself with pe=
ople who are in this movement 
and outside.</DIV>
<DIV>That is not to say t=
hat Ganapati can't give Mukti. The ultimate form of 
Ganapati is the word o=
f God.</DIV>
<DIV>And He is sakshama in giving Mukti as well.</DIV>
<DIV>&n=
bsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The mahamantras are many and I agree that some may say that=
 lets do 
this(mahamantras) first.</DIV>
<DIV>BUT,</DIV>
<DIV>The Vedic mah=
amantras require the kind of intonation so perfect with 
visualisation at d=
ifferent bits of the body with various syllables, that for 
most people thi=
s is not feasible, especially since their Sanskrit itself is 
somewhat impe=
rfect.(remember name is form, if name is not repeated properly then 
how wi=
ll the form be?)(example, of someone who repeated bhakshati for rakshati 
i=
n Pune many years ago).</DIV>
<DIV>And then there are mahamantras which are=
 ok with almost any intonation. If 
someone wants to follow this that is al=
so ok.</DIV>
<DIV>But, with any mantra sadhana, Ganesha sadhana is anivarya=
. Because, the 
entrance to Shakti at Sushumna is guarded by Him.</DIV>
<DI=
V> </DIV>
<DIV>Again some doubt comes into people's heads about some m=
antras harming them 
when recited:</DIV>
<DIV>If somebody experiences bad t=
hings when a mantra of a certain deity is 
recited then all it means is tha=
t the karmas of the Karana shareera are 
being dealt with(by the deity=
) quite fast, so they have to be 
experienced. It actually means that =
the Devata is close and more intense sadhana 
is needed. </DIV>
<DIV> =
</DIV>
<DIV>Actually, all this business about mantra and mahamantra is imma=
terial, 
Allah malik Hai, voh sab janta hai.</DIV>
<DIV>Us parvardigar se p=
rarthana kar, woh sab raste khol deta hai.</DIV>

  Knowledge is Power but shar=
ing it gives enlightment.<BR>><BR>> Knowledge 
  is indeed Power. How=
ever, looking at one's own knowledge as power, feeling 
  proud and wanting=
 to get some influence or authority over people using it is 
  kshatriya at=
titude. It does not lead to enlightenment. Such attitude restricts 
  the b=
looming of (and also the benefit to the world from) one's 
  knowledge.<BR>=
><BR>> One should humbly look at oneself as an instrument 
  of god a=
nd operate guided by one's sense of dharma, without being sensitive to 
  w=
hether others are praising or criticizing one. Swami Vivekananda famously 
=
  said once that Ramakrishna could have created 100 Vivekanandas from sand =
and 
  whatever he was and did was due to his guru's greatness. That is wha=
t I mean 
  by humbly looking at oneself as an instrument. BTW, Swamiji was=
 not one to 
  show off fake humility. He spoke his mind frankly and always=
 stood up for what 
  he believed in, with unmatched honesty, integrity, co=
nviction and 
  fearlessness.<BR>><BR>> Surrender to god, ask for not=
hing (including any 
  knowledge), be grateful for whatEVER He gives (inclu=
ding any knowledge) and do 
  what you see as your dharma with what he give=
s you. THAT is the spirit of a 
  braahmana.<BR>><BR>> Interestingly,=
 one with a pure braahmana attitude 
  automatically becomes powerful. One =
who wants power and control is upset when 
  that is undermined. One who wa=
nts money and profits is upset when that is 
  underminded. How can anyone =
upset one who wants nothing and does whatever one 
  *can* with whatever on=
e *has*? Freedom from desires (including desires related 
  to knowledge) i=
s the highest power.<BR>><BR>> In not-so-old days, 
  braahmanas roam=
ed this earth who very pure like fire, who had no desires and 
  who fulfil=

<BR>> 
  Ganapathi homam is the best homam for anybody to start with. As=
 a spiritual 
  sadhana, it is a good idea to do Ganapathi homam for a few =
months before 
  starting any other homam. Ganapathi controls the mooladhar=
a chakra, as well as 
  the the opening of the sushumna nadi. Thus, he prot=
ects one's material life 
  and enables spiritual progress. Moreover, Ganap=
athi sadhana pleases Ketu and 
  that can help in one's astrology pursuits =
too.<BR>><BR>> > My humble
