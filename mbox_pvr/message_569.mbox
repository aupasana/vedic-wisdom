Namaste friends,
 
As you know, detailed manuals giving short methods to pe=
rform Mahaganapathi homam, Chandi homam, Sri Krishna homam and Mahalakshmi =
homam are available on my website. Now Sani (Saturn) homam manual has been =
added to the collection.
 
Maharshi Parasara taught homam for planets for r=
elief from troubles given by them. Sani (Saturn) gives many people physical=
 sickness and mental worries. His worship in fire is very powerful for remo=
ving these obstacles so that one's material and spiritual lives can progres=
s smoothly.
 
Those who are troubled by Saturn in birth chart or in transit=
s or in dasas/antardasas may consider performing Sani homam for a few month=
s. Instead of doing it once, it is better to do it on a regular basis. It c=
an be done everyday or every Saturday (or some other weekday) or once every=
 month etc. The procedure taught in the manual can easily be finished in 30=
-45 minutes. There is also a super-short procedure in the manual.
 
Today i=
s Saturday. Krishna Trayodasi came just a few hours back. This is a time Sa=
turn likes.
 
Please go to the homam main page and click on the link for Sa=
ni homam:
 
http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam
 
Please feel free to forw=
ard this to anybody who may be interested. Our goal is to create a communit=
y of people worshipping various deities in fire. Manuals for homam of some =
more deities will be added to collection slowly.
 
If there are any questio=
ns or comments on homam, please use the vedic-wisdom yahoogroup for discuss=
ion.
 
Krishnaarpanamastu,
Narasimha
