Namaste Sir,
=A0
I am glad you had a chance to try it. With more practice, =
fire management will become easier and it will become even more enjoyable!
=

=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0

IMHO, it is perfe=
ctly fine to use other sticks or even tongs to move a burning stick/coconut=
/materials from one part of homa kundam to another. Many yogis who maintain=
ed fire with them carried tongs also. For example, you can read in "Ramakri=
shna and His Disciples" that Tota Puri (Ramakrishna's Vedantic guru) threat=
ened to hit with his tongs a servant who wanted to light a pipe from his fi=
re pit.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0

Yes, god i=
s in fire, but it is that aspect of god that your consciousness is able to =
manifest in that fire. Depending on the state of your consciousness will be=
 the strength and nature of fire in your homa kundam.
=A0
See, fire is too =
powerful when free. When free and strong enough, it can burn forests and to=
wns also. But, when fire inside a homa kundam is constrained with a badly a=
rranged pile of materials, it may struggle to burn even those materials. Si=
milarly, divinity is too powerful and can transform anything/anybody when f=
ree to act. However, when the divinity inside a person is constrained with =
a badly arranged pile of vasanas (conditioning), it may struggle to remove =
that conditioning.
=A0
By re-arranging things so that fire can burn things =
better, you are not disrespecting god. Just as enabling the divinity within=
 yourself to remove more conditioning is good, so is enabling the fire in y=
our homa kundam to burn more materials.
=A0*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Shastras (e.g. Vishnu Dharmottara Purana) are clear t=
hat fire in homa kundam should be bright and in a majority of the area. Low=
 fire and smoke should be restricted to a smaller portion of homa kundam an=
d a higher portion should have bright fire. In fact, shastras ascribe bad r=
esults to any homam done with low fire and a lot of smoke.
=A0
That keeping=
 a reasonable amount of fire burning in most of the homa kundam is quite im=
portant.

=A0*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
BTW, peopl=
e think of the guru-sishya play between Ramakrishna and Vivekananda, but do=
n't realize that the guru-sishya play between Tota Puri and Ramakrishna was=
 not any less interesting!
=A0
In the incident I referred to above, Tota Pu=
ri became angry with the servant for his "sacrilegious" act of wanting to l=
ight his pipe from Tota Puri's fire pit. Tota Puri threatened to hit him wi=
th his tongs and the servant ran away. Ramakrishna laughed until he rolled =
on the ground and said, "Oh, for shame, you forgot already". When Tota Puri=
 remarked indignantly that the servant was insolent, Ramakrishna elaborated=
, "Oh yes, he was insolent. But you were forgetting your knowledge of Brahm=
an! Weren't you just telling me that there is nothing but Brahman and that =
a knower of Brahman can't be deceived by Maya? Yet the next moment, you for=
get all that and you are ready to beat one of Brahman's manifestations! You=
 see, Maya, which you despise, is stronger than you think. Maya is omipoten=
t."
=A0
An alert sishya will benefit himself as well as the guru..
=A0*=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
As Ramakrishna aptly pointe=
d out above, Maya is much stronger than anyone may imagine. In fact, all th=
at one may imagine or think or conceptualize or understand, whether about m=
aterial world or about spiritual notions or even the concept of non-duality=
, are still within the domain of Maya! While it is perhaps possible to over=
come Maya, every action one undertakes in the process of either understandi=
ng or accepting or overcoming Maya is still governed by Maya and in the dom=
ain of Maya.
=A0
While I appreciate the concepts of Adwaita as taught by ri=
shis in Upanishads etc, all I can do is to bow to Mahamaya with humility an=
d awe.

=A0
Best wishes for Maharnavami and Vijaya Dasami!

=A0

Best regar=
ds,
Narasimha
