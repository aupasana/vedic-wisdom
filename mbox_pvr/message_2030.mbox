Namaste,
 
We are getting too many mails like this these days. As I said ea=
rlier, this list is NOT for horoscope readings or recommending remedies. Fo=
r that purpose, use vedic-astrology and other such lists. This list is for =
understanding spirituality and what self-realization means, understanding i=
ssues related to spiritual sadhana for self-realization.
 
I added the foll=
owing the group description and any new member will get the following when =
they subscribe. I am sending it to existing members also in this mail. In f=
uture, the following policy will be implemented. If anybody makes a post li=
ke this again, I will ban them from the list. Unfortunately, I have to take=
 drastic measures to keep the focus and reduce spam.
 
--------------------=
-
Please note that discussions on individual horoscopes are unwelcome here.=
 For that, there are other yahoogroups like vedic-astrology. Please do not =
send horoscopes for horoscope reading or remedy recommendation to vedic-wis=
dom yahoogroup. This yahoogroup has a zero tolerance policy, instituted aft=
er several abuses, in that matter and offenders will be banned right away.
=

Best regards,
Narasimha
