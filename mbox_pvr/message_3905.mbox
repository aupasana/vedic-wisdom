Namaste,
 
I am reminded of an incident. One night, Swami Sathasivom (the h=
ead priest of Kalikambal temple in Chennai where Shata Chandi homam was don=
e, which started the homam movement), Narayan Iyer (member of this list) an=
d I were going in a car from my house to a priest's house in this area. At =
the time, Narayan was smoking about 10 cigarettes a day.
 
Anna (we lovingl=
y call Swami Sathasivom "Anna", meaning elder brother) asked Narayan, "didn=
't guruji (he lovingly calls me guruji) ask you to stop smoking?" I answere=
d no. I added, "but anna, I once considered asking Narayan to stop smoking =
as guru dakshina. But I thought I would ask for something bigger and more i=
mportant. So I did not ask."
 
Narayan did not say anything. But, when he r=
eached home that night, he threw away all the cigaretta boxes he had at hom=
e. This was in late 2005 or in 2006 (I forget). He has not smoked since the=
n. Just knowing that I considered asking him to stop smoking was enough for=
 him!
 
Of course, not everyone will have that kind of mental strength. It =
is not easy to give up habits in a jiffy.
 
Being able to give up cigarette=
s, alcohol etc is useful. If one is able to give up desires, anger, jealosy=
 etc like that, it is even more useful! 
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

 he composed songs of deep devotion that have immense power and depth on Lo=

any great composers of Carnatic Music in that path. In fact they were all g=
reat advaitis and never saw any difference between any form of the God, wha=

> > >

nanda equates changing the loyalty from diety to diety as akin to prostitut=
ion, which I find as an extreme view! If that were true, why would Adi Sank=
ara compose so many hymns in praise of so many dieties, Thyagaraja composed=
 in the praise of Sri Rama, Krishna, Shiva, Ganesha and Jaganmata as well. =
So are so many great composers / poets. The examples of Tulasidas and Leela=
shuka where they wanted to see their favorite deity form only (rama in the =
case of former and krishna in the case of latter) despite knowing that the =
other form is the same supreme being, are only a very minority in the list =
of Bhaktas that we have? Why this kind of a view. I see myself being equall=

nesha, amba, subramanya, anjaneya and so on!
