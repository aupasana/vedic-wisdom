Subject: Wasting Prana (life force)

Namaste friends,

When we do heavy physical work, we lose physical energy and feel weak. 
Similarly, mental activity also consumes our prana (life force) and 
exhausts us. I will give a couple of simple examples from real-life, of 
how that happens and how we need to be alert to conserve prana.

*        *        *

I am scared of dogs. I walk for about 20 minutes after lunch. When I was 
walking oneday, a couple of fierce looking dogs in the backyard of a 
house starting barking at me really loud. Though there was a fence, they 
were shaking it and trying to climb it. I was scared, but kept walking. 
My pulse and breathing became a little irregular and some negative 
chemicals were produced in my body, which would affect me possibly for a 
few days! While I was feeling very nice before this, I started to feel 
weak and uncomfortable. I wasted some prana (life force) in this 
experience and mind lost its balance!

As long as conditioning remains in my chitta that "this body should not 
be hurt at any cost", it is natural to protest (mentally and even 
physically if needed) any attack on the body.

Even if such conditioning is left, a useful behavior is to ignore the 
dogs and possibly chalk up a plan on what to do in case dogs overcome 
the fence, i.e. should one run or fight or climb a tree or whatever. It 
is a useless behavior to just imagine things, speculate and worry.

What is worse is that I went on the same road next day. Even though dogs 
were not in the backyard, I remembered the previous day and started to 
worry. Remembering the previous experience made the mind spend some 
energy on unpleasant scenarios and lose prana. My breathing again became 
irregular and I felt weak and uncomfortable. The weird thing here is 
that dogs were not even in the backyard this time.

*        *        *

I'll give one more example. I had an important meeting in the morning. I 
started a little late and got stuck in traffic. While I drove to work, I 
worried all the way that I may be late for the meeting. I speculated on 
several possible outcomes. All this activity expended my praana and 
disturbed my mental equanimity. In the end, I discovered on reaching 
work that a few other people were stuck in traffic and the meeting was 
postponed. All my worry was pointless.

As a matter of fact, even if meeting happened on time and I was late, 
all my worrying while driving would not have helped me at all. If I 
thought being late would have bad consequences, I should've thought of 
what was in my hand then, i.e. what I could do. For example, call 
someone and make some arrangement to cover for me, or call someone and 
ask to delay the meeting, etc.

*        *        *

Though my examples are trivial, one may encounter more serious cases. 
Suppose someone observes something with one's health and starts 
speculating that it may be a serious disease (e.g. cancer). If one has 
doubt, one can read up and estimate the probability. If one thinks it is 
a serious possibility, one can go to a doctor and get checked. But, some 
people do not engage in such actions that are in their control, but keep 
speculating and worrying. With a constant depletion of praana in such 
worries and spending of praana in those thoughts, one may indeed develop 
that disease too!

*        *        *

When there is an action to be taken, we can consider all options and 
pick the best action. When there is no action to be taken, we can 
consider the possible cases that may arise in future and pick the best 
actions in different cases. Such activity based on "what can I do and 
what should I do" is a useful way to expend prana.

But, sadly, we expend prana in a lot of activity that is NOT based on 
"what can I do and what should I do". We imagine pleasant situations and 
get overexcited, we imagine unpleasant situations and get worried and so 
on. All that mental activity directs the life force of mind to various 
objects and their play (which happens in the mind!) and expends a lot of 
prana.

*        *        *

Focus on what is your hand. Focus on your actions. Try your best to not 
think too much about things not in your control. Speculation about 
future should be strictly from the point of view of considering possible 
scenarios for identifying possible actions and preparing oneself for 
those. Consideration of past should be strictly from the point of view 
of considering how previous actions played out and learning lessons for 
current and future actions.

Actions are in your hand. Focus your attention on your actions. What 
comes to you is not in your hands. Don't expend too much praana 
speculating on what is out of your control.

Happy MahaShivaRatri!

Best regards,
Narasimha
