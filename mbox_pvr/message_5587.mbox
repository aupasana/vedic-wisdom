Namaste,
 
Interesting! Re-incarnation IS real, but identifying one's last incarnation is difficult. Sri KN Rao collected some data of young people whose past life recollections were independently verified by researchers. He provided the birthdata, deathdata and rebirthdata of some reliable case studies.
 
I have done some work with it and am interested in all the data I can get hands on. So thanks for your data. More than birthdata of the first life, I am interested in deathdata (date, time and place of death). The last moment of life is an important one. It gives clues to the last thought/desire, which is the foundation of the next life. Moreover, death data is effectively birthdata of another existence, which will end when conception for rebirth occurs. Thus, if death chart is taken as the chart of an independent existence, rebirth (or rather conception for it) should show up as a major major event in annual/monthly charts and transits. I have made some observations before, but more work is needed.
 
In any case, this topic better belongs to vedic-astrology list than vedic-wisdom list. I am cc'ing this mail to vedic-astrology. Let us continue this discussion on vedic-astrology if needed and drop the discussion on vedic-wisdom.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
