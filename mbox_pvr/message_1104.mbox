Namaste,

Yes, dried cow dung does produces more smoke. From the point of view of 
smoke control, copra (dried coconut) is the best substance. It has a good 
balance of oil, fibre and carbohydrates to catch fire, sustain fire and burn 
for a long time without as much smoke as wood.

Best regards,
Narasimha
