It does. But I am trying make one more crucial point. Let me make it using an analogy.
 
Atleast in US, we have child-proof scissors that cut paper/cloth but do not cut the finger even if a child accidentally puts finger in it.
 
In an age when children did not need to use scissors and parents did scissors work for them, these kind of scissors weren't needed. Now, with parents being busy or otherwise unable to help, children need to use scissors for their homework sometimes. So the market came up with child-proof scissors that are safe and do not cut fingers.
 
Simialrly, remedies were done by trained experts (priests) in the past. As the priest class started to become weak and unable to help laymen, Nature is evolving things so that laymen are enabled and safely too.
 
*        *        *
 
In the old days, ruling kshatriya class contained very dharmik kings who were unselfish and used the power and authority vested in them to provide prosperity to their subjects and render selfless justice. As Kali yuga advanced and the kshatriya class became selfish, self-serving and incapable, Nature gave rise to an evolution and people became responsible for governing themselves. Kings who rule for their entire life are slowly fading away from the surface of earth and democracy is taking root everywhere, where kings change in every few years.
 
Similarly, priest class of old days contained genuine braahmanas who did sadhana, realized god and were selfless and used the energy they accumulated through sadhana to provide prosperity, material and spiritual, to people around them selflessly. As Kali yuga advances and the braahmana class becomes selfish, self-serving and incapable, Nature is giving rise to an evolution and people are responsible for their own remedies and sadhana for material prosperity and spiritual evolution.
 
But it is not so bad. Nature is very kind. Nature makes easy and safe tools available to laymen before its tells them "you're on your own".
 
*        *        *
 
People are suffering from terrible material problems now-a-days and also starving for good spiritual direction.
 
Based on old habits, they instinctively expect someone else to fix their problems. They think that getting a pooja or homam done by a priest for a couple of hours oneday or getting a "charged" yantra and rudraksha maalaa will magically cure their problems. Unfortunately, it is not so simple today. If there is a sadhaka who does enough sadhana and "charges" an object such as a yantra or a maalaa or an idol with that energy and gives it to you, you can indeed benefit from it. But gone are those days and gone are those people. Remember, you're on your own!
 
Forget special yantras, forget special maalaas, forget special idols, and forget rituals done by priests. Have faith, have confidence and do sadhana by yourself on a regular basis.
 
The most effective and safest sadhana to do by oneself is homam (fire ritual). Download the homam manuals (see site below) and try a homam on a regular basis.
 
Or pick a mantra and do japam with it mentally everyday for an hour or so, while sitting still with closed eyes and an erect back. If your knees hurt, sit on a chair or sofa comfortably, but keep the back straight and eyes closed.
 
*        *        *
 
There are many generic mantras (see my original mail at the bottom for a sample list) that are appliable to everybody and can solve ALL problems. For example, Vishnu sahasranaama stotra explicitly says it can solve ANY problem. Instead of looking for a "perfect mantra recommendation", you can pick a generic mantra like that and start sadhana. The key is faith and persistence.
 
If your kaarmik blockage is the size of a rock, small amount energy may be enough to move it away. If it is the size of a big boulder on the other hand, much more energy may be needed.
 
All that is in your hands is to do sadhana with faith and persistence. And, remember, no effort is ever wasted. Every effort bears a fruit of comparable size eventually.
 
Of course, you may be looking for a shortcut, but there is NONE. And sadhana is not so bad. Even before it solves your actual problem, the first thing sadhana does to you is: it gives you the courage to face the problem.
 
*        *        *

Nothing is untenable. Though selfless surrender makes sadhana more efficient, sadhana without selfless surrender is also fine!
 
Even if one's mind is filled with reasonable material desires (marriage, children, job, health etc), one can still do sadhana. Sadhana then takes care of one's material and spiritual needs and increases surrender and selflessness in one *over the time*.
 
Bottomline: Good sadhana increases selfless surrender and selfless surrender promotes better sadhana. This is a positive feedback loop. One should somehow or the other break through. Break the impasse and just start some sadhana. Don't fear that something bad will happen or that you will not be able to do it. Just pick a sadhana and take the plunge!

That is what we are trying to do here..
 
*        *        *
 
Every mandala in RigVeda starts with hymns to Fire. Fire was worshipped by ancient people such as Zorostrains,  Vedic rishis and ancient Greco-Romans. Even progressive modern paths such as Buddhism and Arya Samaj accept fire worship. Fire is a living representation of divinity on earth and spending time worshipping god in fire has a magical and purifying impact on one's consciousness.
 
The proof of the pudding is in eating it. One can try homam every day or or every weekend for a few months and see for oneself what it does to one.

Narasimha

Most priests doing rituals for people today are also not well-developed as sadhakas and incapable of doing anything of substance for others. Thus, one is better off surrendering to god and praying by oneself.

As a result, some believers got accustomed to accepting that a pudding exists even without eating it and remain hungry throughout life. And some intelligent people stopped believing in god and in remedies. Let me first address why this has come to be and then talk about what we should do.

One primarily interested in knowledge and spiritual progress would be a Brahmana. One primarily interested in power, authority and control over others would be a Kshatriya. One primarily interested in money would be a Vaisya. One primarily interested in physical pleasures would be a Shudra. One would start off with the varna of one's father, as that is what one is exposed to in childhood. However, as one's vasana (mental conditioning) blooms, one would get one's own varna. One born a Shudra like Valmiki, for example, can later turn into a Braahmana and become a Maharshi. One born a Kshatriya like Viswamitra, for example, can later turn into a Brahmana and become a Maharshi.

> > > >

Some people born in Brahmana families may also end up getting into modern careers and not developing fully as Brahmanas. Some people may be born in Brahmana families with Kshatriya/Vaisya/Shudra tendencies and may end up becoming priests who are interested in power, authority and control over others, money and physical pleasures. Those priests who only care about knowledge and spiritual progress (i.e. true Brahmanas) are very rare. As a result, Brahmanas who have done genuine sadhana and accumulated a good amount of spiritual energy are so few.

If one's bank account is empty, what good is a thousand dollar check given by one? It will bounce. Similarly, poojas done and blessings given by a priest without enough spiritual energy cannot bring one any benefits.
> > > >

The power is in the MIND that FOCUSES on a combination of syllables (mantra) or a sequence of physical actions (ritual). Energy is generated when mind overcomes its tendency to wander and instead focuses on one thing. Different mantras and rituals as the focus points may generate different kinds of energy, but the key is focus. Without it, no mantra or ritual produces anything. Focus comes with a lot of practice. Most priests are just engaging in casual practice when they go and do poojas. In the old days, priests did intense sadhana and brought that energy to the table when they did rituals at the houses of people or in temples.

BTW, I have nothing against the "Brahmana by birth" class, having been born in an orthodox Brahmana family myself. I have neither love nor hatred for the "Brahmana by birth" class. My only wish is that more people - from any birth caste - develop into true Brahmanas.

Atleast your identification with the trouble and your desire to solve the problem will be better than the priest. If you manage to generate enough focus after practice, the mantra/ritual may actually produce some result. There is no harm in trying.

Suppose rules dictate that you MUST eat 2000 calories everyday, 40 grams of protein, so many grams of vitamin A etc. Suppose you have no access to such balanced food. Will you starve yourself until you find a balanced meal or will you manage with whatever you have? If you just have a bowl of dal (lentil soup) and rice, you will simply eat it. You atleast get some energy.

The Sanskrit name for fire is paavaka, i.e.  purifier. Fire is a living god that everyone has access to. Spending time worshipping god through fire purifies one's subtle consciousness. Homam is far more effective than most other sadhanas in improving one's focus, changing one's inner personality and removing material and spiritual obstacles. One need not take my words for granted. One can try for oneself for a few months. The proof of the pudding is in eating it.

When composing the Jyotish masterpiece "Brihat Paaraasara Horaa Saastram" just before the advent of Kali yuga, for guidance to the people of Kali yuga, Maharshi Parasara recommended various types of homam as remedial measures for various problems in the horoscope. In fact, most remedies he recommended involve homam. Parasara asked to follow whatever procedures one was taught for starting fire and did not focus on the nitty gritty of homam. He only gave the main mantra to beused in homam. Parasara's clear teachings set to rest the notion that some people have, that homam is not for Kali yuga.

Some of them are laymen who never even lit a lamp and did not know how to do ANY pooja or ritual. It is a miracle that such people are doing a homam everyday, like the rishis and Brahmanas of yore. I also know personally that some people doing homam for a couple of years are actually starting to experience things within and outside and, more importantly, going through rapid internal transformation.
