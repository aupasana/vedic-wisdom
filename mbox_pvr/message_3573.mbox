Narasimha ji,

Thanks,

      Namaste,

We tell a young stude=
nt to study well and get good scores in examinations. We tell him that he s=
hould go to so and so institution (e.g. IIT, IISc, , REC, IIM etc). But we =
know that going to IIT or getting 90% score in exams is NOT the goal of edu=
cation. The goal of education is to understand the subject well and have a =
good career. It is possible to get 90% score without understanding well and=
 it is possible to go to IIT and not understand the subject well.

Similarl=
y, the goal of spiritual sadhana is to get better control over mind, overco=
me the internal enemies as much as possible and become liberated. But, we t=
ell people to do so and so rituals, follow so and so procedures/formulas , =
go to so and so temple etc.

Some formulas were created so that there is so=
me structure to sadhana. But there is nothing absolute about those
 formula=
s.

Yes, if your gurus told you the formula of n times japam, n/10 times ho=
mam, n/100 times tarpana etc and you want to follow it, please do so. No ha=
rm in it. Some people believe that such a procedure gives "siddhi" in a man=
tra.

However, please note that there are many people who did purascharanas=
 using such formulas and did not really get any "siddhi" in the mantra. On =
the other hand, there are people who did not stick to those formulas and ye=
t found god through the mantra.

In my opinion, you can do just japam with =
a mantra without worrying about 1/10th count homam, 1/100th count tarpana e=
tc. Or you can also do a mantra entirely in homam without any japam or tarp=
ana. Choose one practice and do it until your mind is so absorbed in it tha=
t your mind is chanting that mantra sub-consciously when it is free (like s=
ome people hum catchy songs when they are free).

Regardin=
g the astrological formulas for evaluating the impact of a mantra, I would =
like disown those concepts originally taught by Pt Sanjay Rath and shared b=
y me in my astrology classes. There are many technicalities, but many many =
corruptions in the way knowledge is preserved. Most rules and technicalitie=
s of mantra shashtra apply to people who do prayogas to get specific materi=
al results (and naturally those rules have been intentionally corrupted by =
Nature in preparation of deepening Kali).

Bottomline is that a mantra done=
 for spiritual progress works based on your mental visualization of the man=
tra and its deity and the latent forces of conditioning in your mind. All t=
he house calculations based on the numbers of letters and number of words a=
re irrelevant. Moreover, a veda mantra like Gayatri mantra can be done by a=
nyone without worrying about technicalities.

Regarding adding "Om"
 or "Om=
 Bhur bhuvas suvah" or Om bhuh om bhuvah om suvah om mahah.." etc, there ar=
e many standard approaches. I suggest using what you were taught by your gu=
rus and not worrying too much about it.

Utpal asked about =
count vs time. Counts sometimes force people to speed things up. In my humb=
le opinion, it is fine or even better to set a time limit (e.g. one hour, t=
wo hours etc) and do japam for that time irrespective of the count.

Best r=
egards,
Narasimha

      Narasimhagaru, 
=C2=A0
Thank you for such a nice explan=
ation. Even with not maintaining Brahmacharya, I could see significant prog=
ress in terms of my control of temper etc. when I did Gayatri Japam in the =
past. Did not know the significance of Brahmacharya then (in future I will =
practise with Brahmacharya) . But the way I did was it was one a lakh puras=
charana (daily 1000-3000 times) for a period of two months and then I did a=
 homam to complete the dasamsa in homam. For the homam, however, I have cal=
led about 10 people (Grihastas / Brahmacharis altogether) and we all did ch=
ant the mantra while I performed the homam. This is how our Sharmaji instru=
cted us to do. So, is a Dasamsa homam, satamsa for tarpanam, sahasramsa for=
 marjanam and finally dasamsa of shasramsa for feeding the number of brahmi=
ns (so basically, for a laksha Gayatri, 10 brahmins must be fed, to finish =
the ritual of purascharana) . This is how I thought the big japams must be =
done. Can you shed more light on
 this? 
=C2=A0
Also, Gayatri mantra is a 2=
4 syllable mantra starting with tatsavitur.. .., but if the vyahritis are a=
dded it becomes a 30 letter mantra (om bhur bhu va ssu vah=C2=A0). How shou=
ld this be practised? 30, I suppose strengthens the 6th house, whereas the =
24 strengthens the 12th house, according to your explanation? Sorry for dig=
ressing into astrology ! (but they are tightly integrated here and could no=
t avoid this question). Please tell me if my interpretation is right and al=
so please tell me which approach is better.

Namaste,

What he wrot=
e was to do Savitri Gayatri mantra 1000 times everyday in one sitting and d=
o like that for 100 days at a stretch without break. Then possibly give a b=
reak for a few days and do for another 100 days. Like that, do for 3 stretc=
hes of 100 days each.

Of course, if needs no break, one can do 300 days in=
 a row too. But, keeping brahmacharya (abstinence) may be difficult for som=
e people and hence the suggestion of the break.

For success in any sadhana=
, brahmacharya is very important. Restraint from sex and control of anger a=
nd short-temper will help one avoid leakage of shakti (purifying energy). E=
verytime one experiences lust, anger etc, one loses some shakti.

Every fac=
tor contributes a little to success. Beard is useful. The tradition of grow=
ing beard exists in many religions and it is not without a reason. We discu=
ssed this sometime back.

If one is living a lifestyle where one avoids
 co=
ntact with any tempting situations altogether (e.g. living in a remote mona=
stery), beard may or may not add much value. But, if one is living a lifest=
yle where one comes in contact with tempting situations regularly (e.g. liv=
ing in the modern world with a family and job and a TV), beard can be very =
useful. As I said earlier when we discussed this, beard is not the complete=
 solution but a small part of the solution. Just as a railing on the side o=
f a hill road may stop a slowly moving car from sliding off the hill at nig=
ht but be unable to stop a fast moving car out of control, similarly a bear=
d can help a person with decent control over the mind to retain control in =
some tricky situations.

Trimming beard is ok.

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

If one in=
deed does 1000 times Gayatri (or any mantra for a couple of hours) everyday=
 for one year while maintaining brahmacharya,
 
while following the simple =
rules of same place, same time everyday and facing the same direction, one =
will certainly make good progress. Brahmacharya is one key thing and sittin=
g still with an erect back, neck and head with the eyes closed is the other=
 thing. The probability of mind becoming still is almost zero if the body i=
s not still. If the body can be kept very still, there is a chance that min=
d will also become still for a moment. If the mind is still for even a mome=
nt, it will cause great bliss. As mind gets more used to being still, it wi=
ll become still more often and for longer times. Then various kinds of sama=
dhis become possible.

Narasimha

This is a great mail and very inspiring. However, I have=
 one question on Sri Manishji's advise on how to carry out the sadhana. He =
says do it for 100 days and repeat the whole procedure for 3 times. So, sho=
uld we do 3000 times japam in a day for 100 days or do 1000 times every day=
 for=C2=A0300 days? He also says 'Grow a beard'. Now, in a professional cor=
porate life, that could be a difficult thing. How about trimming it?.... ju=
st to be tolerable to other people. Maybe my question is silly but it is ge=
nuine.

<div> </div>
<div>Thank you for=
 such a nice explanation. Even with not maintaining Brahmacharya, I could s=
ee significant progress in terms of my control of temper etc. when I did Ga=
yatri Japam in the past. Did not know the significance of Brahmacharya then=
 (in future I will practise with Brahmacharya) . But the way I did was it w=
as one a lakh purascharana (daily 1000-3000 times) for a period of two mont=
hs and then I did a homam to complete the dasamsa in homam. For the homam, =
however, I have called about 10 people (Grihastas / Brahmacharis altogether=
) and we all did chant the mantra while I performed the homam. This is how =
our Sharmaji instructed us to do. So, is a Dasamsa homam, satamsa for tarpa=
nam, sahasramsa for marjanam and finally dasamsa of shasramsa for feeding t=
he number of brahmins (so basically, for a laksha Gayatri, 10 brahmins must=
 be fed, to finish the ritual of purascharana) . This is how I thought the =
big japams must be done. Can you shed more light on
 this? </div>
<div>&nbs=
p;</div>
<div>Also, Gayatri mantra is a 24 syllable mantra starting with ta=
tsavitur.. .., but if the vyahritis are added it becomes a 30 letter mantra=
 (om bhur bhu va ssu vah ). How should this be practised? 30, I suppos=
e strengthens the 6th house, whereas the 24 strengthens the 12th house, acc=
ording to your explanation? Sorry for digressing into astrology ! (but they=
 are tightly integrated here and could not avoid this question). Please tel=
l me if my interpretation is right and also please tell me which approach i=
s better. </div>

out the sadhana. He says do it for 100 days and repeat the whole procedure =
for 3 times. So, should we do 3000 times japam in a day for 100 days or do =
1000 times every day for 300 days? He also says 'Grow a beard'. Now, i=

 trimming it?.... just to be tolerable to other people. Maybe my question i=
