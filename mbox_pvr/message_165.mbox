Namaste friends,

Both the versions are correct and work differently. Beejaksharas are 
pronounced ending with "m" as well as "ng".

However, please note that the "g" should not be explicitly pronounced. The 
pronunciation of "ng" in beejas "gang" or "aing" or "hreeng" etc is actually 
like that of the letter "n" in the English word "king" or "monkey". Though 
it is written as "ng", the sound "g" is not actually pronounced. To 
pronounce "gang" correctly, start to pronounce "gang" and stop *just before* 
you pronounce the last letter "g". Unless you are about to pronounce "g", 
the correct pronunciation of "n" is not possible. So think that you will 
pronounce "gang", but suppress "g" at the last second.

Many Tantrikas use "ng" as the nasal at the end of most beejas, while others 
use "m" as the nasal at the end of most beejas.

Nasals are of aakaasa tattwa (ether/space) and owned by Jupiter. The nasal 
"ng" is a combination of agni and aakaasa tattwas ruled by Mars and Jupiter 
and is akin to Guru-Mangala yoga given by them. The nasal "m" is a 
combination of vaayu and aakaasa tattwas ruled by Saturn and Jupiter and is 
akin to Brahma yoga given by them. Both are correct, but work differently. 
Do whatever comes naturally to you or whatever your guru taught you!

Best regards,
Narasimha
