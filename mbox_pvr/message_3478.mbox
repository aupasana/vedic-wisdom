Namaste,

The issue is not just lack of emotion or excitement. The real thi=
ng is ego and self-identification. If one thinks "I am so and so person. I.=
 I am doing so and so action", then the action creates karma.

The case of =
a person without any I-ness is tough to imagine and very rare. Most soldier=
s who kill opponents in war do incur karma for it. Their I-ness is attached=
 to a body-name-entity. Even if one following orders, one is following one'=
s order because one is doing a job. One may be doing a job because one need=
s money. One may need money to take care of the body-name-entity that I-nes=
s attaches to and people associated with it (family).

Even Arjuna had an I=
-ness and thought "Why should *I* kill gurus and relatives". That is why Kr=
ishna taught him Aatma jnaana (self-knowledge) and made him a realized pers=
on, before he was to kill his gurus and relatives.

Unless one has a sadgur=
u (like Krishna in the case of Arjuna) who takes away one's I-ness from lim=
ited entities, one is very likely to be operate with a limited I-ness and i=
ncur new karmas with all actions, even the ones performed calmly, coolly an=
d without any emotion.

Best regards,
Narasimha

      Narasimha Ji



Thank you for resp=
onding with a succint and clear answer. However one last question lingers i=
n my mind...



If a person truly does an act without an sense of emotion a=
ttached or I ness as mentioned by you and does not create any fresh karma .=
.



This also explains to me the actions of the Great Trailing Swami who p=
erforms a puja to Kashi Vishweswara with his own offal as mentioned in book=
1 and yet Shiva does not punish him. Also the great Gajanan maharaj's actio=
ns on similar lines which I read from Pandit ji's website.



In the case o=
f an solider on the battlefield this above theory clarifies a lot because t=
he soldier is only performing his duty and there is a good chance in certai=
n cases he will act emotionlessly. ..Eg: He sees a wounded enemy ...if give=
n an order he will still go for the kill and do his predetermined dharma.Se=
en from an outsiders moral tinted lens all the above actions will seem wron=
g...



Now if the needle is flipped to the other extreme...If an killer do=
es an murder cold bloodedly without emotion....say as an contract killing a=
nd years of killing has hardened his nerves and he no longer feels emotions=
..he is simply doing it as an job...



Would this mean he is also not incu=
rring karma ...



Please forgive my repeated childish questions, just tryi=
ng to clarify some things for my understanding thats all.



Pranams
