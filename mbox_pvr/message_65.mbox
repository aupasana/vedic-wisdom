Dear Kishore,
 
There are so many practices that are geared towards creatin=
g discipline, reducing ego, overcoming the inner enemies and purifying ones=
elf.
 
Any practice will do. However, depending on who one was earlier and =
what one did earlier, one may experience different levels of affinity towar=
ds different practices and also get results at different speeds with differ=
ent practices.
 
Normal people can only give you good advice from THEIR per=
spective. They cannot give you advice from YOUR perspective. Only a sadguru=
, who knows more about the real you than you yourself do, can give you advi=
ce from your perspective. Unfortunately, I am  not one.
 
If you want my su=
ggestion nevertheless, here are some basic suggestions.
 
(1) In "Yoga Vaas=
ishtham", Maharshi Vasishtha prescribes company of saints as the first step=
 in acquiring self-knowledge. Spend some time every week with spiritually i=
nclined people discussing spiritual matters.
 
(2) Identify one personal we=
akness (e.g. anger, jealosy). Make a sincere effort to overcome it. Wheneve=
r the weakness strikes you (e.g. you become angry), consciously restrain yo=
urself and divert your mind to something else (e.g. repeating a mantra).
 
=
(3) Take a mantra (e.g. Gayatri mantra). Spend atleast 30 minutes everyday =
repeating that mantra. Sit comfortably with a reasonably straight back and =
closed eyes and repeat the mantra. If your mind wanders off the mantra and =
its deity and you get distracted by all kinds of thoughts, do not worry. Ac=
cept it as the nature of mind and make a conscious effort to pull the mind =
back into the mantra and its deity.
 
(4) Before that japa, do a simple pra=
nayama for 5 minutes. Breath in through the right nostril for n seconds, br=
eath out through the left nostril for n seconds, breath in through the same=
 left nostril for another n seconds and then breath out through the right n=
ostril for n seconds. Keep the time duration - n seconds - approximately th=
e same in all steps. If you want, you can use a small mantra as the measure=
 of time and say it mentally in each step. Keep repeating this sequence for=
 5 minutes.
 
(5) Cultivate the thinking that you do not own anything. Thin=
k that you are just a *temporary caretaker* of things that seem like your p=
ossessions (e.g. you relations, your house, your car and even your own body=
, name, fame etc). Tell yourself that all these are god's property and that=
 you are servant and a temporary caretaker. Just as a servant working at a =
rich man's house takes excellent care of things entrusted to him without de=
veloping the "it is mine" attachment to the things, tell yourself that you =
too have to take excellent care of all the things entrusted to you (e.g. yo=
ur relations, your house, your car, your body, name, fame etc) while cultiv=
ating the "it is god's and not mine" sense.
 
This is a very important step=
 and just keep on trying if you keep failing.
 
(6) Read a little of some s=
cripture or teachings of a holy man everyday. Examples are BhagavadGita, Jn=
aneshwari etc. I particularly recommend "Gospel of Ramakrishna". Ramakrishn=
a Parahamahamsa was a great master who taught the highest knowledge in simp=
lest terms to all kinds of people. Read his teachings with an open mind, un=
derstand them and try to follow them.
 
*        *        *
 
If some previ=
ous karmas are blocking one's spiritual progress, one has to either burn th=
ose karmas through sadhana or experience the result of the karmas. Then onl=
y the blockage will go away. There is no other way.
 
Each minute spent in =
spiritual sadhana - including japam, homam etc - contributes to that. No ef=
fort is wasted. One should never get disheartened.
 
Best regards,
Narasimh=
a

  Dear PVR,

  There is a pr=
ofound gravitation towards the knowledge flowing here. From the sidelines, =
I aspire to learn the basics to better understand your messages. In your pr=
evious mails you suggested Ganapathi Homam as a daily ritual. Your messages=
 convey a concept that there are umpteen paths to vedic wisdom. For starter=
s can you please give a list of readings and daily practices. It could be d=
ue to lack of initiation or laziness if we cannot do Homam what do you thin=
k we should start with. 

  Namaste,
  -Kishore.
