Namaste Sir,
=A0
(1) If one is doing a homam or tarpana once every blue Moo=
n, hiring a priest is practical. If one wants to do it as a regular daily p=
ractice, that may become impractical.
=A0
In fact, now there are tens of th=
ousands of people doing a homam daily or weekly, using the manuals.
=A0
(2)=
 Just as eating little dal and rice every DAY may give more strength in the=
 long run than a 20-course meal once every YEAR, similarly doing a small ho=
mam everyday will give far more spiritual strength than a one-off thing.
=
=A0
In fact, as per shastras, a brahmana is supposed to do homam and tarpan=
a everyday as nitya karma, though very few brahmanas (by birth) really do i=
t today.
=A0
(3) I have nothing against hiring priests. After all, those pr=
iests need to earn livelihood too! So please give generously to local pries=
ts, whether or not you use them.
=A0
(4) I am simply enabling people who ma=
y want to do a ritual by themselves for whatever reason (e.g. doing daily o=
r living in a foreign country without many priests or whatever).
=A0
*=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
I am reminded of an anecdot=
e here.
=A0
One person who visited US found out about these manuals and too=
k a printout of Ganapathi homam manual with him to India. He showed them to=
 an old local priest in AP, India. That priest was very pleased, took 200 x=
erox copies with HIS OWN money and apparently distributed them FREELY to vi=
sitors at his temple. He told them, "using this, you can do a small homam b=
y yourself everyday. You can help yourself, while helping dharma in the wor=
ld at the same time. If you are interested, please take one."
=A0
He shows =
that a true brahmana appreciates more people doing a dharmik activity, than=
 feel threatened or see them as competitors.
=A0
If you find such brahmanas=
 in your town, please help them generously. Good brahmanas are so rare now-=
a-days. In the link I sent earlier (http://vedabase.net/sb/11/17), please r=
ead 11.17.16 for Krishna's description of the qualities of a brahmana.
=A0
=
Best regards,
Narasimha
