Namaste,
 
It is never too late. In any case, overcoming ego it is a long p=
rocess.
 
Seeing different deities differently and seeing them as different=
 manifestations of the same deity are both fine. If you start disliking peo=
ple following one approach or become irritated with their thinking, that sh=
ows rajas or tamas. If you understand that all approaches are valid and fol=
low the approach your mind is inclined in, it is a sattwik approach.
 
(1) =
Well, you neither promote begging by helping someone, nor do you eradicate =
begging by ignoring someone. Instead of looking at the system, look at the =
individuals you encounter. If you can help someone and get an instinct to h=
elp someone, do it.
 
At the end of the day, there is no universal right an=
d wrong in any matter. In Mahabharata, Bhishma teaches that dharma comes fr=
om one's heart. The conscience of a person is pure and shows dharma clearly=
. But, when the instinct coming from conscience passes through the conditio=
ned mind, it may become modified by the conditioning of the mind. If one is=
 following the conscience, engaging in actions with surrender and giving up=
 doership to god at the end, slowly conditioning is removed and conscience =
will shine brighter through one's actions.
 
(2) Yes, such money-minded peo=
ple are there in every profession, even in noble professions such as priest=
s, Jyotishis, teachers of scriptures, spiritual leaders etc. But why should=
 we judge others? Why not focus the rational mind instead on oneself and ju=
dge one's own shortcomings?
 
(3) Mind is highly conditioned by duality and=
 responds to symbols. For example, one may say or even think that all mater=
ial things are an illusion and temporary. One may say or even think that be=
auty and ugliness are illusive and temporary and death catches up with ever=
ything. But, can one control one's mind when encountering a beautiful perso=
n of opposite sex without clothes? Can one control one's mind when someone =
abuses one badly or priases one to the skies?
 
Theory is different and con=
trol over mind practically is different. To train the mind, we use many sym=
bols. For example, one may see men and women burning on funeral pyres and t=
he image may stick to one's mind. When one sees a beautiful person, one may=
 recall those images and mind may think about the impermanence of body. Sym=
bols encountered in various religions offer ways for the mind to distract f=
rom negative thoughts and train in thoughts promiting spiritual progress.
 =

(4) Some aghoris, some priests, some jyotishis and some spiritual leaders =
may be running after money or fame without realizing their impermanence. Th=
at is not surprising. But why should we bother about others? Why not focus =
on ourselves?
 
Secondly, someone merely accepting money may or may not be =
attached to money. A realized man does not run after or run away from anyth=
ing. One cannot judge a person accurately from one's actions. One's intenti=
ons and attitude cannot be confidently judged from one's actions.
 
(5) NEV=
ER be jealous of anybody. Everyone has one's own samskaras and one's own ri=
nas and gets results accordingly.
 
(6) Difficult. If you are a little less=
 angry in situations where you normally experience anger, if you are a litt=
le less jealous where you normally feel jealosy, if you are a little less a=
ttracted to material things that normally pull you towards them, if you are=
 a little less proud in situations where you normally experience pride, if =
you are a little less depressed in situations where you normally experience=
 depression, and if you are able to think of god now and then as the doer o=
f all actions with some sense of surrender, I can say you are making some p=
rogress.
 
The prgress is not linear. One may make very slow progress for a=
 while and make good progress in short duration, then slowdown again, then =
accelerate again and so on. Keep doing sadhana and it will not go waste.
 
=
(7) The divine bliss does not come from elsewhere. It is already there. It =
is your own likes, dislikes, anger, jealosy, shame, pride etc that block it=
, like black paint on a lampshade blocking the light of the lamp. To taste =
it, you have to overcome those internal enemies and surrender more complete=
ly and unconditionally to god. "I will surrender to you and accept whatever=
 you give. But in so and so matter, I want only so and so result" is not co=
mplete and unconditional surrender.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
