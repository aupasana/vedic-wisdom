Namaste,

I am cc'ing this reply to vedic-wisdom yahoogroup, without revealing 
your identity. Others may have the same questions.

1. Sound is nothing but vibration. When vibrating vocal cards make air 
particles vibrate, that vibration reaches the ear drums of people. 
However, it is not just gross matter that vibrates. With every thought, 
mind vibrates too. Vibrations in subtle matter around us are more 
powerful than vibrations in gross matter around us.

The intentions and attitude are an important factor in deciding the 
quality of vibrations at the subtle level. Subtle level is definitely 
more important than gross level.

2. Normally, we make offering with palm facing up. Palm facing up is a 
symbol of asking and palm facing down is a symbol of commanding. When we 
make any offering to any god in homam or to an idol or to any respected 
person, we make it palm facing up.

Making an offering, one can hold it between (1) thumb and index finger, 
(2) thumb and ring finger, (3) thumb and middle & ring fingers.

Thumb symbolizes ahamkara (sense of I). Ring, middle, index and little 
fingers stand for dharma (duty/principles), artha (resources/work), 
kaama (motivation/desire) and moksha (detachment/liberation). When we 
meditate or hold a mala or make offerings in homam, thumb (ahamkara) is 
associated with one or more of purusharthas. The most popular mudra is 
tips of thumb and index finger touching each other. It increase 
knowledge and detachment. Another popular mudra is thumb touching ring & 
middle fingers. This is for dharmarhas, i.e. increase one's resources 
and follow dharma. Some people also use only ring finger, i.e. follow 
dharma. But using only middle finger is forbidden, i.e. why do you need 
resources (money etc) if not to follow dharma?!

When using a mala or holding a ghee spoon for making offerings in homam, 
some people keep the index finger away and use only the fingers. They 
believe that index finger should not be used. Well, index finger is the 
finger of liberation and knowledge. There is no need to avoid it, unless 
you are doing a ritual for a very specific result.

3. Different materials have different properties and cause different 
results. It is a good idea for people to rotate and offer various things 
each.

4. :-) There are already people whose consciousness has ascended to 
other dimensions. There were, are and will be such people. Don't look at 
2012 as a bus that should not be missed or something like that. In fact, 
2012 has no real spiritual significance. It comes in the middle of a 
period of spiritual transformation on earth. I see the years AFTER 2012 
as being important, rather than 2012 itself. Due to the mass hysteria 
that may develop in parts of human society, aided by natural events, 
2012 may indeed bring some big changes. But the real transformation will 
be afterwards. For example, I see 2015-2020 as a very important time.

The specifics are tough to know, but one thing is certain. An unwise and 
selfish civilization swept most of earth and was about to nearly destroy 
earth. It has been stopped. The foundation has been laid for the fall of 
this civilization and for the old ways will return. People will be 
wiser, more selfless and will lead more dharmik and wholesome lives. 
Sadhana done by all of us will smooth out the transformation and speed 
things up.

Forget about technicalities like 5th dimension, ascension etc and just 
do sadhana. The key is to not want anything specifically, yet be able to 
do anything conscience tells us one we need to do, and being able to 
accept any end result in the end.

5. I do not know much about "Shiva yoga". Yoga basically means oneness. 
We essentially want to merge individual consciousness with cosmic 
consciousness. There are many ways to do it. All are valid paths. Some 
take longer, some take shorter, but all are valid. Each path has 
different challenges and different advantages. One's own prior 
conditioning may make one like some paths and dislike some.

Irrespective of which path one selects for yoga, one huge catalyst is 
the influence of sadguru. A sadguru who throws light on one's weaknesses 
and helps one overcome those, will aid significantly, especially in the 
beginning. After one reaches some level, one's own conscience can act as 
one's guru and guide one well. But, in the beginning, a sadguru helps.

Many specific paths become popular when an elevated person popularizes 
them and some people around him/her make brisk progress in that path. 
But, things slow down for the next generations.

*        *        *

That is why, in order to ensure a stream of seekers who make good 
progress over the next few centuries, without depending on an external 
guru in flesh, we are popularizing homam again. Agni is an energy form 
that you can see and touch physically. He is a living god on earth.

Agni (Fire) is the original seer, original purohit, original priest and 
original guru. If one makes acquaintance with Agni, Agni takes care of 
one. Agni works on one's attitude, transforms one from inside, sharpens 
and strengthens one's conscioence and helps one make spiritual progress.

If you have a good guru, follow whatever path he/she shows you. If not, 
surrender to Agni. Agni will direct you to your ishta devata. Narasimha, 
Manish etc will leave this earth sooner or later. But Agni will be here 
in physical form to guide you forever. Many people will make progress 
using Fire, in the coming few centuries.

Best regards,
Narasimha

     Dear Mr.PVR,
     Hi,I really enjoyed going through you book online(vedic-wisdom),I 
had a few queries of my own,hope to get enlightene:
     1.Does Intention have more weight-age than Intonation/correct 
pronounciation(we usually turn to god when nothing else works and not 
all of us are good at Sanskrit) while doing havan/homam ?
     2.Should we hold the samagri in middle two fingers and offer it 
palm facing downward or upwards?
     3.What is difference between one who is offering ghee and one is 
offering samagri in havan...when a family is doing havan together.
     4.What are your views on Ascencion to 5th Dimension that we are 
hearing about in 2012?
     5.And what about shiv yog...the difference if any from reiki?
     Hoping for your reply at earliest..
     Regards,
     <deleted>
