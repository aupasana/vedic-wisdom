Namaste,
=A0
Your line of thinking is good. Faith is needed in religion, bu=
t corruptions do take place and it is useful to question. Blind faith in so=
me things is useful to make progress, but one cannot place blind faith in e=
verything attributed to a religion and shun logic completely. Truth is arri=
ved at by a combination of reason and faith. Without faith, only reason can=
not take one to the highest truths. Without reason, blind faith cannot take=
 one to the highest truths, especially if one starts off with faith in wron=
g notions (e.g. one may believe that you reach god if you kill people not b=
elonging to one's religion).
=A0
Fortunate is one who finds the right balan=
ce between faith and reason, uses reason to find the right notions to place=
 faith in and makes quick progress.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
(1) In practical physical terms, cow milk is a simple an=
d nutritious food with plenty of poteins and easy to digest. It is very saa=
ttwik and has many useful properties as per ayurveda.
=A0
However, if you r=
eplace cows that live a relaxed lifestyle feeding in open grasslands on gra=
ss and leaves with cows that live a hectic and stressful lifestyle in conge=
sted factories feeding on chicken etc, the gunas of milk are considerably d=
ifferent. It's not the same anymore.
=A0
A cow can produce more milk than w=
hat is needed by its calf. People in the old days never deprived calves of =
mother's milk and took milk after the calf was fed. Instead, if one deprive=
s the calf and steals all the milk (like many factories may be doing), that=
 karma will follow the milk and go to various people handling, using and co=
nsuming that milk, in different proportions.
=A0
(2) Yes, a cloth made of s=
ilk carries a lot of negative karma. Putting so many worms in boiling water=
 and killing them is negative karma. I feel far more comfortable putting in=
 homam fire a cotton cloth made from a tree than putting a silk cloth made =
by killing many worms. Though silk clothes are fashionable in religious cer=
emonies now, one cannot be sure whether this was a custom in ancient times =
or the current silk is a substitute for another kind of cloth made non-viol=
ently in ancient times.
=A0
When people cannot find something that is used =
traditionally, they try to find a substitute to feel good that they are fol=
lowing the customs. If they do not clearly understand the motivation/ration=
ale/spirit behind a custom, they may end up with a bad substitute. For exam=
ple, I have seen people decorating idols with nice looking plastic flowers =
and plastic flower garlands. Plastic is a really bad substitute for a real =
flower. People only use them for decorating idols and do not put them in ho=
mam fire, but who knows, people may start offering plastic flowers in homam=
 fire after a few hundred years.
=A0
Like that, silk clothes may have come =
into usage as a bad substitute for something else.
=A0
(3) Supreme god unde=
rstands everything.
=A0
The purpose of a mantra is not for requesting god f=
or a specific thing. The purpose of a mantra is to stabilize an overactive =
mind and focus it on something. Mind is like a monkey jumping up and down a=
nd running here and there. Mantra is like a rope that ties it to a fixed po=
le (a deity or a focus point). As one tries to focus the mind on a deity/ma=
ntra and give up all other thoughts, a moment will come (perhaps after minu=
tes of sadhana or hours or days or years or lives) when mind will let all o=
ther thoughts go. Mind will then reverberate with the mantra, with no other=
 thoughts in it whatsoever. One forgets oneself completely and gets absorbe=
d in the mantra *fully*. That is when one *experiences* a mantra and a deit=
y.
=A0
Such a thing is possible with any combination of sounds. One can rep=
eat "I bow to the holy father" for ever and reach such a state.
=A0
However=
, depending on the mantra being repeated in the mind and the deity being fo=
cused on, the experience of the mind when the mantra fills the mind and all=
 other thoughts cease will be different. Different mantras will give differ=
ent experiences. Various deities, their Sanskrit mantras and beejas were ex=
perimented by many great yogis before us and well-understood by ancients. I=
f you want to tie a monkey to a pole, any rope can be used. But, if a rope =
was tested before, it may be good to use that rope.
=A0
Secondly, arrangeme=
nt of sounds in Sanskrit alphabet has a deep significance and correlation t=
o the subtle body. Different sounds are vibrating in different parts of the=
 subtle body. Sanskrit alphabet and mantras are constructed beautifully. Wh=
en one's self-awareness ascends from the regular plane of consciousness, on=
e can experience other realms of consciousness that are vibrating with diff=
erent sounds. Sanskrit captures that well.
=A0
Thirdly, each tangible artic=
le (such as a book or an email or a mantra) has some remnants of the energy=
 of persons who associated with it. When I say a specific combination of wo=
rds, it may have one impact on you. When a saint says the same combination =
of words with the same tone, it may have another impact on you. A sentence =
one writes when one is in a bad mood or bad spiritual state may not have an=
y impact on readers. A sentence one writes in a very good state of mind aft=
er a lot of sadhana and control over mind may inspire readers more
=A0
That=
 is because one's shakti works through one's words and other tangible actio=
ns. For this reason, mantras that were composed by great yogis or used by g=
reat yogis are touched by their shakti and may end up storing some of their=
 shakti. One using such a mantra has a chance to capture a little of that s=
hakti. That is why one feels good energy when one chants mantras composed b=
y great souls like Adi Shankara.
=A0
So it is a good idea to use well-known=
 Sanskrit mantras that were used by generations of great saints and yogis.

      Namaskara!



I have some very basic questions and was =
not convinced by answers that are usually given.



1. How can milk be cons=
idered pious? I understand that Cow is a divinely being and is worshiped as=
 `Kamadenu'. But in actual sense we are extracting milk and preventing the =
calf from having its share of milk...Is this not a sin to stop a young calf=
 from having milk from its mother?



2. How can silk cloth be considered s=
acred for worship? Silk is obtained by killing thousand's of cocoon. Using =
a product which is obtained by killing so many living beings and we being a=
 cause for such an action...Are we not doing sin?



3. I tell my daily pra=
yers but I have not learnt Sanskrit and don't understand the meaning of man=
y prayers that I say everyday. Why is it necessary to say the slokas in San=
skrit and not other language??

Will our Supreme Lord not understand other =
languages ?? or is it just bcos Sanskrit has been used from the very early =
times it is still in practice.
