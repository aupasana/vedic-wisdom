<BR>> of caste (varna) has been there in H=
induism for a long time, the 
concept of <BR>> caste mobility was very m=

lived by <BR>> killing birds. He be=
came a brahmana and a maharshi later. 
Vishwamitra was a <BR>> kshatrita=
 and a powerful king. He became a brahmana 
and and a maharshi <BR>> lat=
er. Basically varna shows one's aptitude. One 
starts off with the varna <B=

one <BR>> develops in life, one gets one's own 
varna based on what one =

Krishna's words whic=
