Namaste,

I am cc'ing this mail to vedic-wisdom yahoogroup without revealing your 
identity.

Just for the record, I do not advise against Mahavidya worship at all. 
All I say is that recommending a particular Mahavidya based on horoscope 
is dicey and I am almost sure the standard principles are incorrect. 
Also, I suggest that Mahavidyas are much higher than what people have 
made them out to be. They bestow different aspects of Supreme Knowledge. 
Worshipping them for winning a court case or getting a job (which many 
people try to do today) is like trying to use a missile to crush an ant.

Regarding your dream, it may be genuine or merely a projection of your 
mind. Remember that mind is very powerful and projects various conscious 
and sub-conscious conditioning as its experiences, especially in a 
dream.

If you feel that the dream is a genuine experience of the devata, then 
keep doing the mantra and see what happens.

If you had the same experience with another mahavidya, it is possible 
that your mind is just projecting. If your mind has affinity to a soumya 
devata with certain nature, it may imagine whichever devata you worship 
to have that nature!

If your mind is imagining an Ugra devata as a benign smiling form, 
perhaps you should stick to a Soumya Devata. If the devata really gives 
you a darshan in a fierce form, is your mind capable of handling it? If 
your mind can visualize and perceive an Ugra Devata in a truly fierce 
form and yet feel deep love and surrender for her, then only you are 
suitable for such a sadhana.

Good luck in your sadhana!

Best regards,
Narasimha
