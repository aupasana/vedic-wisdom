Namaste Narasimhaji,

Thanks for the clarification.

I was trying to go thr=
u the saptashati and get familiar with the Sanskrit and also listening to t=
he CD by Prakash Kaushik. But I realized I'm too slow to pick up in this wa=
y reading from the devnagari script. However, if this is the only way - I a=
m not giving up.
Can someone suggest if there is a better way to get famili=
ar or if any English text is available for the entire Saptashati?

Any resp=
onse in this regard would be highly appreciated.

Thanks
Anup

=C2=A0=
 
Namaste,

There is confusion here.

In the saptashati text, add a swaahaa=
 whenever you encounter a number and make an offering, whether the number i=
s after a verse or after an "uvaacha" or after an "UchuH". There should be =
about 700 offerings in saptashati like this.

In addition, outside of the 7=
00 offerings, there are things like kavacham, argala, keelakam, raatri sook=
tam and devi sooktam. In kavacham, no offerings are made. In argala and kee=
lakam, only ghee is offered by adding swaahaa after each verse. I suggested=
 reading raatri sooktam and devi sooktam without swaahaa, because adding sw=
aahaa at the end of a Vedic verse with intonation is tricky. The swaahaa ma=
y require a modifcation in the intonation or even the anuswara of the last =
syllable of the Vedic verse to which you add swaahaa. That is why I suggest=
ed reading raatri sooktam and devi sooktam without swaahaa.

For the 700 ve=
rses of saptashati, there is no issue in adding swaahaa.

Best regards,
Nar=
asimha
