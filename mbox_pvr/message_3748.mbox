Namaste,
 
As Manish says, every being has the birth right to spiritual progress and do not underestimate anybody. If Mother decides, She can convert anybody into a great saint in a split second. I am glad you and your parents have taken important steps and good luck.
 
Each being has a different background and different conditioning and hence a different purpose to serve in the world. We do not know what is right for us, but Mother does. As we plead with her to help us, She gives us exactly what is needed by us for progressing spiritually, pay off the kaarmik debts and become free. One person may first need material stability to progress spiritually. One person may need to give up material life and go to a monastery. One person may need to become affluent and construct temples. The kaarmik forces are driving each person in different paths. Mother finds the best course for each person to reach the same place based on where they are and what their momentum is.
 
She may give money to one person to provide some stability so that the person does sadhana without distractions. She may give money to another person to test him and see if his focus on god wavers. She is the Director with the full script of the movie, while we are two cent actors who act in one or two scenes and know nothing about the rest of the movie.
 
I suggest not worrying too much about any specifics. Just learn to think that the Mother (or Father if you prefer that way, because Father and Mother are not really two different *people* but two different personifications of the same Force that runs the universe) knows what is best and we need to do what we can and accept what She gives us. Try to develop an equanimous state of mind where you accept anything She gives you (riches or poverty, health or sickness, fame or ridicule) with an equal vision.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
