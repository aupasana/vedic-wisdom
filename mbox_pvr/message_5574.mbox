Namaste Sir,
 
In the old days also, there was varna system but it was diff=
erent. People belonged to different varnas based on their aptitude and serv=
ed different purposes in society. It wasn't a rigid system, but a flexible =
and mobile system based on aptitude rather than birth. Of course, because a=
 child may get exposed to what father does and may have a good chance of de=
veloping aptitude for such work, one would by default get father's varna at=
 birth. But, as one grows up and one's vasanas (conditioning from past live=
s) develop, one may develop a different aptitude and may end up with a varn=
a different from father's.
 
For example, Vishwamitra was born as a kshatri=
ya, but became a braahmana and became a brahmarshi later. Valmiki was born =
as a shoodra and lived by hunting birds. He became a braahmana and became a=
 maharshi later.
 
No matter where one is born and how one was brought up, =
anyone who is interested in knowledge and liberation and not interested in =
money or power over others, IS a braahmana. Even if one is born in an ortho=
dox brahmin family, if one is deeply interested in money or power and autho=
rity over others, one is NOT a braahmana. In any case, one varna is not sup=
erior and another varna is not inferior. People of different varnas serve d=
ifferent purposes. It is as simple as that. What we see today - bias, mistr=
ust, fights and killings in the name of caste - are an unfortunate conseque=
nce of deepening Kali.
 
What I am saying is not accepted in mainstream soc=
iety today because we are deeply into Kali yuga. But, when the Mother decid=
es, social notions can change quickly. In fact, we are going through a phas=
e of huge global transformation. Political, economoic, social and religious=
 structures of the world will be redefined during the coming decades and wi=
ll remain valid for many centuries. 
 
BTW, when the divine Mother appeared=
 before my guru in March 2006 and gave a command to spread a simple homam r=
itual in the world for the coming times, her clear directive was to not dif=
ferentiate based on caste, creed, class and race. We encourage anybody who =
desires to worship any god in fire for spiritual progress to perform homam =
on a regular basis using the homam manuals at the homam website (see below)=
.

race of

R=
ather than caste, environment in which one grows up does have a role (and c=
aste does sometimes influence the family environment in India). One born in=
 a family (brahmana or otherwise) that worships god everyday is exposed to =
that notion. One brought up in a family that cares a little about god or mo=
rality and pursues money or power or comforts ruthlessly is exposed that no=
tion. So the religious/spiritual aspects of the environment in which one gr=
ows up do play a role. However, if one has strong vasanas, they will eventu=
ally take hold. One will meet people who make those vasanas flourish and th=
ose vasanas take control.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
