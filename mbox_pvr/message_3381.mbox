Namaste,
=A0
Yes, both fire and air "have duality in them", but, they serve=
 different purposes within duality. Only fire is called paavaka, i.e. purif=
ier. Not air. Fire is reducer and Air is a spreader. Air fills whatever spa=
ce it gets access to and spreads material offered in it in all that space. =
Fire burns and reduces to ashes.
=A0
Whether you put turmeric powder or san=
dalwood powder or coconut or wood or something else, fire burns it and redu=
ces it to ashes of a very small size. Though some air may be released in th=
e process, most of material is reduced to ashes by fire. If you offer those=
 materials in air, on the other hand, it just spreads it around and does no=
t *transform* it and *minimize* it.
=A0
In spiritual sadhana, you want to g=
ive up a lot of conditioning covering consciousness and minimize and transf=
orm the consciousness.
=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha
