Namaste KK,
 
No matter how genuine the video may look, let us give the benefit of doubt to Paramahamsa Nithyananda and not jump to conclusions as someone said.
 
*        *        *
 
*Even if* his expose on video is genuine, it is only a reminder that nobody is free from Mahamaya's web. He is a fantastic teacher of spiritual concepts. He has a charming and endearing disposition and a lucid and eloquent way of explaining high philosophy in simple and demystified terms. Irrespective of his weaknesses that may have been exposed now, he is clearly a man of excellent knowledge and rare wisdom. Who is to tell how *we* will fare when our time comes for a test?
 
No matter how much one has read, no matter how much one has understood, no matter how much sadhana one has done, no matter how many good karmas one has done, no matter what spiritual experiences one had, no matter how blissful one feels during meditation or most of the time, no matter how elevated one is spiritually, one can still fall. Take your mind off god for a second and you CAN fall. When we are not in a state where mind is focused on god 24x7, we are vulnerable to a fall. Then why should we judge others?
 
*        *        *
 
The most important thing is to surrender to Her (or Him) and keep that attitude of a dedicated servant forever. There may be some members of this group who make good progress in the coming years and people around them may start noticing their purity and treating them specially. The key is to not be swayed by name, fame, image, following, respect, money etc and retain the mindset of a dedicated servant, in the midst of either adulation or adversity. If one allows self-consciousness, ego and pride to take root in one's mind, one thing leads to another and one falls in the web of Mahamaya.
 
*        *        *

Even if a spiritual master really had weaknesses and fell, we do not benefit whatsoever by discussing those weaknesses. If we instead discuss his teachings, we may still benefit. A blue sky does not suddenly become green if the greatest liar says sky is blue. Similarly, spiritual truths do not become invalid if a person who taught them fell.
 
*        *        *
 
Perhaps an increase of dharma is not possible without exposing and weeding out some adharma, atleast in key places. We can never know for sure what the Mother has in store. Her ways are definitely inscrutable.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
