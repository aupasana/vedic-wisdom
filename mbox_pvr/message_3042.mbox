Dear Utpal,

Even Vasishtha says there is a state beyond sahaja samadhi in Yoga 
Vaasishtham, but does not describe it. However, he does not say that it 
cannot be achieved on earth.

Bhava samadhi, savikalpa samadhi, nirvikalpa samadhi etc can be 
intellectually understood and appreciated even without experiencing them. 
But other samadhis cannot be understood intellectually.

Best regards,
Narasimha
