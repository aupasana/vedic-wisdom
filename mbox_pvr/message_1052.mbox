Dear Utpal,

The mispronunciation of consonants with "a" occurring at the end of words is 
so ingrained in your common sense that your understanding of Devanagari 
script itself is filled with mistakes.

Look at the enclosed picture (devanagari.jpg). It has six words - shava, 
vasha, shav, vash, shiva and shiv. Each word is written in Devanagari script 
and then in English.

Though the first word in that picture is "shava", YOU will pronounce it as 
"shav". Please note that the second symbol in "shava" is identical to the 
first symbol in "vasha". However, YOU end up pronouncing that symbol as "v" 
in the first word and as "va" in the second word. You pronounce the same 
symbol as "va" in some cases and as "v" in some cases. But please note that 
Sanskrit is not like English and each symbol has a unique pronunciation. If 
you pronounce correctly, that symbol is pronounced identically (as "va") in 
both words. If you really want it to be "v" (without a), it should be 
written differently (as at the end of 3rd and 6th words in the picture).

Please go through the six examples carefully to know how to write things in 
Devanagari correctly.

Bottomline: Things like "Raam" or "Shiv Uvaach" are wrong and mean nothing 
in Sanskrit. The Arabic influence on some modern Indian languages (e.g. 
Hindi) that use the same script as Sanskrit corrupted people 's 
pronunciation of Sanskrit. What are pronounced by people as "Raam" and "Shiv 
Uvaach" should actually be "Raama" and "Shiva Uvaacha". South Indians have 
their own corruptions, but this is a place where south Indians are correct.

Best regards,
Narasimha
