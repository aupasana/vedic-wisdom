Namaste,

Yes, you can offer tarpana for devas and rishis.

You can also offer tarpana for pitris. Even though your parents are alive, 
great grandparents may be deceased. Parents or other relatives of a 
different life may be deceased and there may be significant debt with them. 
Tarpanas can be offered to them.

The mantras in the manual below use the term "svadhaayibhyah" and covers 
only those ancestors who are deceased and having strong desires. If someone 
is alive or deceased but in a higher loka, that person is not covered by the 
mantras.

Best regards,
Narasimha
