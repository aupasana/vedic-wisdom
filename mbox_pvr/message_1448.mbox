Namaste,

Anybody who told you to stop reading Vishnu sahasranaam because it gave 
certain undesirable results has no idea whatsoever. Reading Vishnu's 1000 
names can NEVER harm you. NEVER. It may increase good results or decrease 
bad results, but never increase bad results.

Secondly, the symptoms you are describing sound a lot like some movement of 
praana (life force) in some of the upper chakras. This is not a bad thing at 
all. If some other pieces of the puzzle fall in place, this can actually 
help your spiritual progress considerably.

Instead of telling you to stop Vishnu sahasranaam, I will suggest increasing 
the number of times you read it. If you spend an hour in the morning and an 
hour in the evening, it will be awesome.

In fact, if it is possible, doing a homam every morning with Vishnu 
sahasranaam will accelerate the progress. I will have to soon put together a 
Vishnu sahasra naama homam.

Best regards,
Narasimha
