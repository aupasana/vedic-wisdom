Namaste,
 
Sanskrit is almost like a mother tongue to me. My performing a Chandi homam everyday should hardly be awe-inspiring. On the other hand, there are some people who do not know Sanskrit at all and took 4 hours to read Chandipath with great difficulty in their first attempt. THEY are doing Chandi homam everyday and it takes them 1.5 hours now. THAT is awe-inspiring.
 
Integrating various sadhanas is a personal problem that needs a personal solution. In general, it is a good idea to pick one or two sadhanas and maximize the time spent on them, instead of splitting the time between ten things. As Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, it is better to dig 10 metres in one place rather than dig one metre in ten places, if one wants to find water.
 
One possibility is to do a homam and then meditate at the end after poornaahuti with various mantras one is attached to.
 
I am not that knowledgeable about Sri Vidya. However, from the little I have been exposed to, Sree chakra is a symblic representation of the layers of duality surrounding Self. Its purpose, too, is to unravel the layer of duality and realize Self.
 
Lalita means gentle one and Chandi means the fierce one. If you have a mother who teaches you gently, you will learn slowly. If you have a mother who is stern and strict, you will learn fast (provided you can face the strictness). Both are valid paths.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

    Dear Sri Narasimharao garu,

    I am very much in awe after I learnt that you do chandi homam everyday. You also wrote that it takes about 1.25 hours to 1.5 hours to do your chandi homam. How can you accomplish that feat with 700 ahutis in such a short time? Also, in my case, I do sandhyavandanam with 108 Gayatri (20 minutes)+ganapathi mantra japam 108 times(10 minutes), a short rudra Abhishekam with pachakshari, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 minutes) totalling to about 35 - 40 minutes daily ritual. Plus I sometimes do special rituals several times a week, that takes about 1 to 1.5 hours in all. How to integrate these along with homam? Is Sri vidyopasana different from Chandi homam? Could you please explain what is sri Vidya and how it is to be learnt? I am very motivated to learn what the Devi Mahatmayam is all about but I also have keen interest in Sri Vidya, because I am a musician also and learnt all the nava-avarna krithis of Great Muththuswami Dikshitar recently.

    Nagraj Kota
