Dear Utpal ji,

Yes, it is a great idea to gift such books to spiritually inclined people. 
It is an excellent karma. I am glad to know of your activities.

If you throw a spark of fire onto wet grass, nothing will happen. But, if 
you throw a spark of fire onto dry grass, the whole thing will burn. There 
are souls out there who are ready to burn their karmas in spiritual sadhana 
and who need just a spark. If YOU happen to be the nimitta for throwing a 
spark at them, you will be so fortunate. The only thing is that it is 
difficult to tell such souls apart from others. So you can just try without 
any expectations.

One of my friends finished reading "Ramakrishna and His Disciples" by 
Christopher Isherwood. It inspired him and changed him a lot and now he is 
reading the "Gospel of Ramakrishna". Isherwood's book is a novel-like book 
with a beautiful style. I can recommend that book as a precursor to the 
gospel.

Best regards,
Narasimha
