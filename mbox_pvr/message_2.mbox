Namaskar friends,
 
Today is Krishna Trayodasi tithi (13th lunar day in the=
 waning fortnight) and a Saturday. This combination is known as "Krishna Sh=
ani Trayodasi" and is a very very powerful day to propitiate Saturn. Especi=
ally, with Saturn in a deep gandanta in an inimical sign right now, it is g=
ood to pray to Saturn.
 
Even if you are not being troubled by Saturn, you =
can still pray for the world and for many others who are being troubled.
 
=
In fact, when you pray to a deity, you can just pray for the pleasure of th=
e deity involved rather than any other thing. Other things are secondary. S=
aturn is not too pleased right now with his position and we can pray to ple=
ase him.
 
I am about to go into my Shani japam and homam and I realized th=
at Trayodasi will be almost over by the time I come back and so hurriedly s=
ending this mail.
 
You can download a small Shani mantram as mp3 from my w=
ebsite (link below, go to mantras). You can also pray to Saturn as the Koor=
ma (gaint Tortoise) form of Vishnu. Both are identical, according to Parasa=
ra. The higher form of Saturn is Koorma Deva. Just as Koorma Deva supported=
 the churning of milky ocean with mount Manthara to get amrita (nectar), th=
e patience, discipline, spirit of hard work and austerity within us (Saturn=
 within us) supports the churning of the milky ocean within us. Milky ocean=
 within us is our spiritual essence, Mt Manthara is Sushumna nadi, churning=
 is the spiritual sadhana (pursuit) and the nectar sought is nothing but Sa=
t-chid-aananda (the true bliss of just being). Anyway, you can pray to Shan=
i with the dwadasakshari mantra for Koorma Deva:
 
Om NamoBhagavate Akoopar=
aaya
 
The other Shani mantra can be downloaded from my website in audio fo=
rm.
 
BTW, I promised a manual on a one-hour Mahaganapathi Homam procedure =
that can be performed by interested people. Now I actually have a detailed =
25-page manual giving minute instructions and all mantras and also a 55 min=
ute mp3 audio that records the entire procedure. Interested people can read=
 the document, understand the procedure and then perform the homam by thems=
elves while playing the mp3 (no need to say any mantra by themselves). It i=
s my hope that more and more people will start performing regular Mahaganap=
athi homam, on a daily/weekly/monthly basis. I have done different kinds of=
 sadhanas, but there is none like a daily homam. I will upload the document=
 and mp3 somewhere on the internet and send links soon.
 
BTW, I am not rea=
ding any of these yahoogroups. If you need my attention, please send a priv=
ate mail. But, unfortunately, I am getting only 10 min everyday to read and=
 reply to mails and I get a lot of mails. My sincere apologies if I am unab=
le to help you. Please don't take offense. Even if I cannot help you direct=
ly, I will be praying to Mother to somehow give direction to everybody who =
sought direction from me and failed to get a response from me.
 
May the li=
ght of Brahman shine within, 
Narasimha
