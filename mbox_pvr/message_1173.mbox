Namaste,
 
The goal of spiritual sadhana is to make ego (sense of "I") melt=
 completely. A normal person is so attached to the body that one believes f=
irmly that body is I. From the limited self-identification where there is s=
o much attachment to a body, a name and a specific identity, one cannot evo=
lve in a single day or in a single step to a stage where one does not ident=
ify with anything (and becomes liberated). There can be several steps depen=
ding on the force of previous mental conditioning.
 
One possibility is to =
attach oneself to a larger cause and overcome the over-attachment to the bo=
dy, name and specific identity. Anything that lessens the mind's attachment=
 to the body, name and specific identity is helpful in the short run. Suppo=
se one is so dedicated to one's country (or to a cause such as spreading Yo=
ga or spreading praanaayaama or spreading Jyotisha) that one ignores comfor=
t of body and starts to live and breath that cause. It is helpful in overco=
ming the attachment to the limited self-identity.
 
However, in the long ru=
n, even attachment to a country or attachment to a cause such as spreading =
Yoga or Jyotisha blocks one from liberation. However, attachment to bigger =
and more abstract causes like them is easier to let go than attachment to a=
 seemingly concrete and specific identity such as a body. So, devoting ones=
elf to country or to a cause and working hard on it is a step in the right =
direction.
 
*        *        *
 
It all depends on what debts you have an=
d what stage of spiritual evolution you are at. For a person close to liber=
ation, there is no need to bind further by attaching oneself to a cause, ho=
wever noble it may be. For someone else, however, attachment to a cause is =
a step towards liberation.
 
*        *        *
 
Suppose you are climbing=
 a mountain. You need mountaineering gear, supplies for many days etc. You =
start with a heavy load on your back. As you get higher and higher, you may=
 consider throwing away things and reducing your load. But, if you start th=
rowing away your supplies in the beginning itself, you will not make to the=
 top. You will run out of supplies in the middle itself.
 
Similarly, formi=
ng attachment with working for a country, working for a cause, devotion to =
a god, devotion to a person, a ritual such as homam, a mantra etc are like =
loads you carry which help you climb the mountain. When you are closer to t=
he top and the supplies become a load, you can consider throwing them away.=
 But you need them to survive and climb in the beginning.
 
Best regards,
N=
arasimha

        Namaste Nar=
asimha, 

        I want to narrate an incident before I pose this question=
. The excerpts are from "Living with Himalayan Masters" book. 

        Inc=
ident: (Before the independence of India)
        Swami Rama is a disciple =
of XXX guru (Guru's name is not mentioned in the book as Guru preferred sec=
recy) and is practicing the rigorous of spiritual sadhana in the abode of s=
erene Himalayan mountains, to feel the cosmic consciousness. 
        It wa=
s during this time, the independence movement was in progress in India and =
Rama too got tempted to be a part of the movement. 
        It was at this =
juncture, his guru advised him to continue with sadhana and not to take par=
t in the movement as India is destined to get freedom. 

        Incident 2=
: 
        We keep hearing/reading from noble people like Gandhi, Chanakya,=
 Lord Krishna, Abdul Kalam etc, that country is first before you. (Can we h=
ere imply "you" as sadhana too?)

        These two illustrations are quite=
 contradictory?
        What should we give the first priority to? Country =
or understanding self? Isn't the comfort of being in a country necessary to=
 understand the self? 

        Please do let us know your thoughts.

     =
   Thanks & Regards, 
        --Murahari
