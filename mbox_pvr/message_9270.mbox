As I see it, a Vibhuti is a special manifest=

polean,=C2=A0Socrates, Akhbar,=C2=A0mathematician Sreenivasa=C2=A0Ramanujan=
, Issac Newton, etc.
=C2=A0
A Vibhuti need not be openly spiritual and can =
even be a rank atheist.=C2=A0=C2=A0But a Vibhuti always have a specialized =
power, ability and by virtue of which it gets some work done which, in a la=
rger view-point, helps society in some way or the other in manifesting some=
 change in that field of life which is more in tune with some fundamental s=
piritual principle, which may or may not be religious. Very often a Vibhuti=
 may not even be perfect in many aspects of his/her life and work, yet inva=
riable, if we take an objective perspective, we will find that some part of=
 a greater scheme has been served by their lives, knowingly or unknowingly.=

=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Of spiritual Vibhutis, they can be broadly classified in two=
 categories.=C2=A0 Vibhutis of the Purusha and Vibhutis of the Shakti. This=
 corresponds to the two attitudes that the Tantras advice=C2=A0every shakta=
=C2=A0sadhaka to adopt - that of Bhairava or that of Bhairavi (Shakti). But=
 all kinds of Vibhutis are prepared for their work by the Force, or Chit-Sh=
akti, or Divine Mother, whether they realize it or not.

=C2=A0
<< I =

=C2=A0
Interesting that you mention=
ed this! That is also my conception of the Kalki Avatara or Nishkalanka - t=
he name which Vimalananda says is the last Avatara's real name. 
=C2=A0
Som=
e days ago I was meditating inside a temple when this thought struck me pow=
erfully that the representative of the=C2=A0Atmah among the Avataras - each=

Dear PVR Ji=
, Rajarshi Ji,
Thanks for such thoughtful insights, i really love reading y=
our mails on such misunderstood and thought provoking subjects. It promt me=
 to write first time on this group.
=C2=A0
Regarding the concept of Avatar =
and Vibhuti,=C2=A0do you want to say=C2=A0that Jesus or Nanak or Sai baba o=
r may be Budhha are Vibhutis=C2=A0? 
Seeking the history, there might be or=
 may not be very little evidence of Avatars only we rely upon=C2=A0the lite=
rature corresponding to that. I know it is due to the time frame or Yug cha=
nge but if we=C2=A0consider=C2=A0Vibhutis then we have lot of historical ev=
idences beside literature. Don't we believe that Avatar is a big phenomenon=
 and beyond the scope of scriptures? because we have these scriptures trans=
ferred by one generation to another and might have some bias associated wit=
h them. I am having little knowledge about this but what i feel is that we =
have many versions of same SB or even epics like Ramayan or Mahabahrata.
So=
mewhere i like the concept of evolutionary Avatars, if we consider our fram=
e of reference as our present Universe this concept fits well. By the way i=
f we look beyond this frame of reference it might be different story. My id=
ea is the frame of=C2=A0reference is important in this context.=C2=A0In my =
opinion=C2=A0it may be true that there are other "Worlds" as well which are=
 beyond our imagination or scope, Avatars are Phenomenon of this World, our=
 frame or reference, our universe. So it seems in a perfect alignment of ev=
olution of our universe.
Considering our evolution in present Kaliyug, it m=
ight be possible that Kalki Avatar will be more like a destroyer, i don't h=
ave words to explain here. I remember a picture at Raghunath temple in Jamm=
u where Kalki avatar is depicted like Surya or some thing similar. I hope i=
f some one can shed more light to this.
With my minuscule knowledge on this=
 subject=C2=A0i try to add my two cents to this lovely discussion.

22. It is only in other puranas, that we get the focus on 10 Avatars, and t=

=C2=A0
And ONLY when we take these 9/10 Avataras,=

This, I am in total ag=

As I said, the SB list contains 22 Avataras. It does not focus on th=

=C2=A0
Secondly, if we take 10 Avatars and corres=

not a graha.
=C2=A0
Or, just surmising, can it be possible that until an Av=

=C2=A0
Anyway, I am =
not looking at this main Avatars from the point of grahas/jyotish at all. F=
or that matter, some traditions consider Balarama to be an Avatara rather t=

=C2=A0
=C2=A0
The concept of Avatara and Vibhutis comes from th=

in any transition. A Vibuti need not be spiritual. It could be in any field=
 of work.=C2=A0Sometimes a Vibhuti may not even be aware of its purpose, un=

=C2=A0
Basically, whenever we see excellence in any form, =
in any field, it is always the energy of the One at work..

=C2=A0=
 
Namaste Rajarshi,
=C2=A0
Very nice to hear from you!
=C2=A0
The "unmistak=
eable" link to the *physical* evolution of life on earth does not imply an =
increasing sequence of *spiritual* perfection, as you cannot directly map t=
he physical to the spiritual. More importantly, if your understanding is co=
rrect, why isn't perfection occurring in the FINAL incarnation but occurrin=
g well before?
=C2=A0

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
First, regarding Krishna bein=
g a "poornavatara", SrimadBhagavatam (SB) does not say that Rama is not one=
. In fact, Parasara, father of Vyasa, explicitly mentioned that Rama, Krish=
na, Narasimha and Varaha are "poornavataras" (used that exact expression) w=
hile other avataras have some amount of jivatmamsa too (though paramatmamsa=
 dominates jivatmamsa).
=C2=A0
Secondly, after describing the avataras, SB =
says that there are in fact innumerable avataras and that all rishis, munis=
, manus, demigods etc are avataras of Supreme Lord. It is under THAT contex=
t that 1.3.28 then proceeds to say "these avataras are partial, while Krish=
na is Lord Himself." I question if the deduction that Krishna *alone* is Lo=
rd Himself and Rama is not is accurate! It only seems to say that all these=
 rishis, manus, demigods etc are partial. As I said above, Pararsara explic=
itly said that both Rama and Krishna are poornavataras.
=C2=A0
Third, let u=
s ask a very fundamental question: What exactly does it mean if an avatara =
is "Lord Himself"?
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
While SB talks of Krishna =
being "Lord Himself" in 1.3.28, it also says in 1.3.30: "forms of Supreme L=
ord, who is in reality formless (arUpa) and of the nature of pure conscious=
ness (chidAtman), are manufactured by the qualities of Maya". In the next v=
erse, it further compares forms of Lord to clouds in sky and dirt in air. J=
ust as sky *contains* clouds and is beyond them, similarly Lord *contains* =
forms and is beyond them. So, again, what is the meaning of a specific form=
 that descended on earth being "Lord Himself"? I am afraid people may be mi=
sinterpreting this notion based on their fancies and conditioning..
=C2=A0
=
All beings are made up of paramatma (supreme/absolute being) and jivatma (l=
iving/relative being). The latter portion is dominant in us and is responsi=
ble for desires and rebirth. Great avataras descend from a higher portion o=
f paramatma. Very rarely avataras descend entirely from paramatma without A=
NY jivatma portion. Rama and Krishna are specific examples given by Parasar=
a.
=C2=A0
They are entirely divine, but they do not encapsulate the entire =
divinity!!!! After all, "entire divinity" cannot be encapsulated by any for=
m just as no cloud can contain the entire sky. They take part in the drama =
obeying and executing the divine will but NOT altering it. This applies to =
Krishna as well as Rama.

iritual force in this world. But I do not

=C2=A0
First, he IS mentioned in SB list of =
avataras as well as Parasara's list. If he does not "fit" in your "scheme o=
f evolutionary Avatars", then your concept is possibly wrong and avataras a=
re perhaps not "evolutionary" as you theorize.
=C2=A0
Secondly, as per Para=
sara, Buddha corresponds to Mercury, who personifies logical mind and the s=
pirit of investigation and comprehension. Logical mind and its spirit of co=
mprehension are inherently fallible. Even a perfected spirit of comprehensi=
on is not capable of grasping the Absolute Reality completely, for it is be=
yond comprehension. So, no wonder it simplifies the Incomprehensible in an =
attempt to comprehend! That is what Buddha ended up doing. However, logical=
 mind has a great appeal in the Age of Reason in this Kali yuga. No wonder =
Buddha was/is/will be a great spiritual force in this world in this age.

=C2=A0
If you dismiss Parasara's linking of planets=
 to avataras as a possible corruption, are you absolutely sure that the ver=
ses of SB you are relying on are perfect? (In any case, it's a different ma=
tter that you are only taking some SB verses and ignoring some as I showed!=
.)
=C2=A0
The bottomline as far as I am concerned is that Pararsara's list =
actually makes amazingly coherent esoteric sense. The nature of each aspect=
 of consciousness (e.g. Buddha - spirit of comprehension, Saturn - spirit o=
f patience & persistence, Venus - spirit of happiness etc) and the story of=
 corresponding avatara DOES have a highly meaningful connection, esoterical=
ly speaking. After all, esoterically is how you really need to understand a=
ny higher scriptures and notions in them.
=C2=A0
If we take scriptures lite=
rally instead and draw lopsided conclusions, some would conclude that Shiva=
 is the "supreme" one and other deities are "inferior"; some would conclude=
 that Surya is the "supreme" one and other deities are "inferior"; and so o=
n.

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
On a different note, someone may think th=
at Kali, being Aadyaa, is superior to Tara and like Kali more. But, some le=
arned yogis have declared them to be essentially the same and some scriptur=
es even prohibited differentiating between them. As I see it, the differenc=
e between them is too subtle for even rishis to clearly comprehend. People =
seeing some significant difference between them are, I am afraid, merely pr=
ojecting their own conditioning. Same in the case of Krishna and Rama. Both=
 were=C2=A0 perfectly detached and fully divine karma yogis.
=C2=A0
If we t=
hink about it, perfected mind (paramatma aspect represented by Moon) and so=
ul (paramatma aspect represented by Sun) are not really that different. So =
I am afraid Krishna and Rama are not that different, though the specifics o=
f their stories may be different.
=C2=A0
One last word though. If someone t=
ruly believes that Krishna is superior to Rama and worships Krishna (or vic=
e versa!), I am very happy for such a person. My arguments are more for the=
 sake of sharing thinking/knowledge and pushing the boundaries of understan=
ding in the long run, than changing the minds of anyone in the short run. I=
n the end, everyone of us will have to go through one's own cycles of vario=
us tamasik, rajasik and saattwik stages of evolution before one starts gras=
ping some fistfuls of Reality. These concepts are too subtle for anyone to =
convince others or be absolutely confident oneself!

which were composed in the Kali-Yuga, namely the Puranas.[When Krshna was a=

 Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krshna, (Budd=
ha) and Kalki. There is an unmistakeable connection of the form and sequenc=
e of these main avatars with the evolution of life on earth. From the aquat=

 Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, this indicates that spirituality is not t=

various manifestation and potentials that lie inherent in the consciousness=
 and its development through various life-forms. Larger spirituality of ear=

 earth.

of these main 9/10 Avatars. It is not my contention that if one worships sa=
y Matysa Avatara, one will not attain to a state of liberation of the soul.=
 As is the nature of spiritual cosmology in Hinduism, any Devata can lead a=
 person to any depth of realization. And each one of the Avatars of Vishnu =
are self-realized in their own way and can be consider super-massive spirit=

>=C2=A05. Of these, naturally, Rama and Krshna are most =
adored because they represent a stage of evolution, both inside as well as =
outside, which society can relate of much easier, in this age. Rama represe=
nts, for me, the stage of most satwic mind. A satwic mind is in control of =
itself. It known how to transform the animal tendencies within and without =
- monkeys - into a constructive force for a greater purpose. However, as wi=
th a state of full Sattwa Guna, there can be instances, even though few, of=
 dejection. For it is static in nature and will change only when circumstan=
ces force it to. As per the Valmiki Ramayana, Rama did feel dejected while =
searching for Sita in the forest. He did have a moments fear before the fin=
al assault on Ravana, which was dispelled by Agsatha when the later reveale=
d the stotra of the Sun to Rama. At the end of the final battle, Rama tells=
 Sita, in a most dispassionate manner, that he killed Ravana not to rescue =
her, but it was
 the Dharma to do so, and to unhold his family honour. That=
 too was the dharma of that age when he lived, family honor. The way I look=
 at this grand epic, and I bow humbly to the genius of Rishis Valmiki for r=
epresenting the things as they are, as a scribe, as a poet, as an observer,=
 and not adding his own preferences to it anywhere, in the 14 years of trib=
ulation that Rama faced which culminated into his killing Ravana, he change=
d into the most dispassionate leader, such that no personal consideration o=
r emotions or passions can overturn the Rajadharma. His life is a lesson of=
 what a true leader must be! Krshna, OTOH, had this immaculate detachment r=
ight from birth. I am not taking his=C2=A0 supernatural feats into account.=
 It is his singular and constant detachment from situations, from people, f=
rom environment, from circumstances that mark his life. At the age of eight=
, he decides to leave Vrindavana for Mathura. All his friends, his foster p=
arents, his
 village-folks who so loved him, pleaded with him that it would=
 make no sense for him to leave the shelter, love and comfort of his happy,=
 settled village life and head into an unknown destiny and destination. Krs=
hna tried to reason with them, then he understood that they won't understan=
d, he promised he will return back once his work in Mathura is over. He nev=
er returned. Later, much later, when the Gopis came to him asking him to pa=
rticipate in their dance, he obliged. But the moment some of them started g=
etting jealous and possessive of Krshna, he removed himself quietly from th=
e scene, saying that he belongs to everyone equally and no one has any spec=
ial right over him. When Shishupala abused Krshna, the later merely kept dr=
opping flowers on the floor, smiling and counting. The moment the 100th abu=
se was over, he swiftly cut off Shishupala's head and was back into his poi=
se. But when Bhurishrava unfairly accused Krshna of being a revolutionist a=
nd
 charlatan, Krshna did not kill him. When Duryodhana, who used to think =
of Krshna as another black magician, wanted to arrest him, Krshna showed hi=
s vikarala roopa in the assembly of kings, yet he did not finish the enemie=
s off. The very next moment he was back into his own poised self. Never in =
the whole Mahabharata is there one instance of his going overboard, never a=
 single shade of depression, equivocation, or lack of confidence in his act=
ions, irrespective of what others say or think of him. And then right in th=
e middle of the greatest war he had the perfect equipoise to deliver the mo=
st sublime spiritual philosophy. That is why his life remains the best idea=
l of Karma-Yoga. For a true Karma-Yogi by definition can never be dejected.=
 It is impossible. Neither the action nor the results belong to the instrum=
ent. When running away from the battle-field and killing Kaliya Yavana, or =
when advising Bheema to tear apart Jarashanda, or gesturing Bheema to
 hit =
Duryodhana below the waist, or getting Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krshna, as=
 if by some Divine Intuition, knew exactly how the situations must be lined=
 up which would cause the destruction of these people. This kind of knowled=
ge cannot come by the rational thinking. But happens when one is constantly=
 and consciously connected to the Universal Force. We do not find these kin=
d of complex situations in the Rama Avatara, at least in the Valmiki Ramaya=
na. Of course, if we take the Adhbut Ramayana or such other auxilliary text=
s and retelling, we get a different picture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana we hav=
e a 1000 headed demon attacking Rama after he kills Ravana, and then Sita t=
urns into Adya Shakti and demolishes the 1000 headed demon and Rama worship=
s her. But if we take only the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the picture th=
at emerges is very clear. Rama is the embodiment of Sattwic mind. Therefore=
 he displays all the great characteristics of satwa, chief of
 which is sel=
f-control, as well as the occasional sadness caused due to separation from =
his wife Sita whom, at least until Ravana was destroyed, he loved very dear=
ly. Satwa guna creates a true saint, but can also cause some grief when the=
 stability is shaken. Krshna was gunatita. He had no attachment to anything=
 in this world - man, women, deva, danava, friend, enemy - and therefore he=
 was never affected any trace of negative emotion. His Ananda never left hi=
m even in the most trying situations. 6. Buddha was great spiritual force i=
n this world. But I do not see him fit in the scheme of evolutionary Avatar=
s. His realization, the one he advocated, is a static realization, an end i=
n a void. This is clearly denying of the reality of this earth. I find this=
 not in tune with what either Rama or Krshna espoused. None of them negated=
 this world. If negation of this world and life is the final aim, then why =
send so many avatars at crucial stages of evolutionary
 development? If the=
 spiritual impact on masses is the reason for Buddha being an Avatara, then=
 why not Jesus or Zorathrusta.? They are no less impactful in that sense. B=
ut do they fit in the scheme of spiritual line that these 9 Avataras of Nar=
ayana indicate in a most logical manner? No. As such many vaishnava traditi=
ons in parts of India, do not consider Buddha to be an avatara. Realization=
, to be complete and holistic, must be both static and dynamic, outside of =
life as well as inside of life. That is why the Tantras formed their own ki=
nd of spiritual philosophy, of the world as body of Shakti and therefore an=
 object of reverence and realization. 7. The original literature of the Nat=
h Yogis used to mention 9 chakras. These are centers of psychological funct=
ions. 6 inside the human body and 3 too subtle, or non-developed in most pe=
ople, even seekers. It is my belief that each of the 9 Avataras - excluding=
 Buddha - correspond to the full power and force
 of one of these 9 Chakras=
. Similarly, the 9 grahas, or that which can modify consciousness or allow =
the consciousness to explore and express itself is various possiblities, ar=
e 9 in number. The lagna is a reference point and not a graha. Therefore th=
e chief Avatars who represent the parable of evolution are nine in number. =
And the ninth of the sequence is yet to come. 8. I cannot comment on which =
graha would typically represent which Avatara. I know of what the BPHS says=
, however, it is my belief - feel free to disagree with it -:)[one cannot r=
ule out some deep-rooted corruption of understanding or textual misrepresen=
tation in this Kali-Yuga] - that the Atmah among the Avataras has not yet a=
ppeared. It will be Kalki, or as Vimalananda seems to say in the Aghora boo=
ks, Nishkalanka - the stainless one. There is only one thing which is perfe=
ctly stainless, the Atmah .After a Nirguna/Gunatita awastha comes living in=
 the full and complete purity and might
 and force and strength of the Atma=
h. By the sheer dint of his purity the last Avatara will burn away opposing=
 forces of this world and fulfill the purpose of evolution. Even Krshna use=
d diplomacy at various points in his adult life to achieve his ends. Kalki,=
 I am speculating, won't even need that. The white horse and that sword is =
a metaphor. He will be the only one capable enough to rectify the various e=
rrors and corruptions that beset our age. Well, this is how I look at the s=
tory of Avataras. It is perfectly ok not to agree with my views, but I am r=
easonably sanguine now that this is what is closer to truth. -Regards =C2=

>=C2=A0 
>Namaste friends, =C2=
=A0 There was a discussion on Lord Vishnu's Dasavataras on a limited access=
 forum on Facebook. A learned friend wrote that "Krshna is the God-man", "P=
revious Avatars are a build-up to this stage" and "Buddha after Krshna is l=
ike going back from the linear progression of spirituality that the Avatars=
 manifest one after the other upto Krshna". =C2=A0 I want to emphatically d=
isagree with this notion that Dasavatars of a "linear progression of spirit=
uality..upto Krshna". =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 Each avatara represents=
 an aspect of Supreme in a perfected form. =C2=A0 Maharshi Parasara equated=
 dasavataras with planets. For example, Rama, Krishna and Narasimha are Sun=
, Moon and Mars, respectively. =C2=A0 We also know that Sun, Moon, Mars, Me=
rcury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are personifications of soul, =
mind, energy/initiative/drive, learning spirit, wisdom/discrimination, spir=
it of enjoyment/being happy, patience/discipline,
 spirit of innovation/bre=
aking barriers and detachment (respectively). =C2=A0 Correspondingly, each =
avatara is an expression of that aspect of Supreme in a perfected form. Eac=
h story is an example of how that aspect operates. =C2=A0 Lord Rama's story=
 is a perfected example of how soul operates. Lord Krishna's story is a per=
fected example of how mind operates. Lord Vamana's story is a perfected exa=
mple of how wisdom/discrimination operates. Lord Narasimha's story is a per=
fected example of how energy/drive/initiative operates. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=

=A0 * =C2=A0 Now, let us remember one basic thing. Soul in us, mind in us, =
energy in us, learning spirit in us, wisdom in us, happiness in us, discipl=
ine/patience in us - all these are different manifestations of the same Sel=
f. However, when Self manifests as these different aspects, it has differen=
t qualities and plays different roles. There is no comparison between them.=
 =C2=A0 We MAY focus on one aspect of us first,
 perfect it and then perfec=
t other aspects through it. But, we need balance between all aspects in the=
 end. Similarly, these different aspects of Supreme Being are incomparable =
and are in a balance working together in the Cosmos. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=

* =C2=A0 One who is fascinated by the qualities of soul may like the story =
that demonstrates how soul operates; one who is fascinated by the qualities=
 of mind may like the story that demonstrates how mind operates, and one wh=
o is fascinated by the qualities of wisdom may like the story that demonstr=
ates how wisdom operates. And so on. But this is just a matter of taste and=
 subjective preference. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 Let us focus on Rama a=
nd Krishna, i.e. soul and mind. Soul is seen as a representative of god in =
us, because of some basic attributes of it. It is the higher self and has n=
o agendas, no likes or dislikes. =C2=A0 Once mind fancies a separate existe=
nce with some
 agendas/desires, soul supports the individualized consciousn=
ess stemming from that fancy and sees it as its dharma. It lends strength a=
nd support to EVERY aspect of this individualized consciousness (e.g. mind,=
 energy, intellect, learning ability, enjoyment, discipline etc). It suppor=
ts them fully and yet has no desires/agendas/likes/dislikes of its own! It =
impassionately witnesses and records all of one's agendas and karmas so tha=
t Laws of Nature give proper fruits later on. It does all that despite full=
 awareness that it is neither doing those karmas nor receiving the fruits. =
As mind and other aspects of the individualized consciousness entertain the=
 notion that they are doing things and begetting the fruits, soul supports =
them fully in this play. It sees that as its dharma and does it impassionat=
ely. =C2=A0 Now, does this sound exciting? Perhaps not to all. This functio=
nality of an impassionate witness supporting the play, may not seem interes=
ting enough
 to some. =C2=A0 On the other hand, mind has likes, dislikes an=
d agendas. It is constantly pursuing those agendas, getting things and achi=
eving things. Movement of mind is what keeps the individualization going!!!=
 Though soul is the support for everything else in the individualized consc=
iousness, soul is a witness doing its dharma impassionately. It is mind tha=
t keeps the individualization going and brings in agendas and passion and e=
ven decides/affects every entity's dharma. That way, mind is really the "bo=
ss" of the individualization. No wonder Krishna's life appeals more to one =
who may be excited by this description! =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 Lord K=
rishna is obviously awe-inspiring, but let me put Rama's life in perspectiv=
e. =C2=A0 Rama's life demonstrates how soul operates. At a young age, he re=
ceived Brahma Jnana from Vasishtha and became realized. Yet, he did whateve=
r was his "dharma". He helped Vishwamitra. Soon after marriage, he was give=
n
 kingdom. At the last moment, his father banished him to forest at the be=
hest of his step-mother and his step-brother was given the throne. He had n=
o complaints. Though his father, step-mother and step-brother felt guilty t=
o various degrees, he himself supported and consoled all three and followed=
 his dharma impassionately. Though he knew leaving Sita in the forest with =
Lakshmana and going after the golden deer would cause problems, he did it i=
mpassionately when Sita insisted. When she was kidnapped by Ravana, he sear=
ched for her and fought the battle. He never faulted Sita for forcing him t=
o leave her or faulted Lakshmana for leaving her later. He accepted every l=
ife situation with no complaints and did the best possible action then. Eve=
n as he killed Ravana, he did so without hatred or anger, but as his impass=
ionate dharma. Even as Ravana was dying, he went to him and respectfully le=
arned some subjects that were going to disappear with Ravana! =C2=A0 Rama
 =
is a perfect example of a liberated man with no desires or agendas who impa=
ssionately discharges one's dharma arising from the momentum of karmas befo=
re liberation. THAT is basically what soul does! =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=
=A0 As another example, let us look at Lord Vaamana. His story is a perfect=
 demonstration of how wisdom/discrimination operates. =C2=A0 He was born as=
 a learned pygmy. He filled the entire cosmos to rid earth of a charitable =
demon king with many great qualities. =C2=A0 Wisdom/discrimination makes on=
e humble and unassuming. When one is doing good work but tainted with demon=
ic qualities (e.g. pride or attachment), one's discrimination is not please=
d until that pride is suppressed. When wisdom fills one's entire consciousn=
ess, then demonic qualities are completely suppressed. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =
* =C2=A0 Please think about the other avataras. The stories can be understo=
od as perfect demonstrations of how various aspects of
 our consciousness o=
perate, based on clues from Maharshi Parasara. =C2=A0 Let us not compare Da=
savataras, but celebrate each of them separately. Of course, if you are mor=
e attracted to one of them, please think about that avatara more and develo=
p devotion. They are ALL capable of relieving us from samsara. =C2=A0 *=C2=
