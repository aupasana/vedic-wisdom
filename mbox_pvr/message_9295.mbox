If you are doing homam for spiritual progress, you can offe=
r naivedyam (cook it before eclipse and eat it after eclipse) and you can u=
se idols in addition to fire for invoking the deity. If you are doing homam=
 to fulfil material desires, I do not know the answer.

t is difficult to miss the phonetic=C2=A0similarity between terms Bhagawata=
 and Bhagawana. The Bhagawata religion started from the Gita and a contempl=
ation of the life of Krshna. All the major purely=C2=A0Vaishnava Acharyas -=
 Ramanujacharya, Madhavacharya, Vallavacharya, Nimbarka, Sri Chaitanya=C2=

=A0relation between jiva, paramatma, moksha=C2=A0etc), Krshna as the ultima=
te conception of God on earth. This was aided in no less a measure by the d=
elcaration of the earliest Puranas, that is Vishnu Purana and the SB, that =
Krshna was a complete Avatara. Some,
 like the Gaudiya Vaishnavas, went one=
 step ahead and took a very literal view of it all and declared Krshna as t=
he Ultimate Being, and the formless Paramatma, as well as Narayana,=C2=A0as=
 merely=C2=A0the aura of Krshna. Rama was also intricately linked to this K=
rshnaa-ism, but was looked at as the earlier brith of Krshna, not as a sepa=

s not say that Rama is not one. In fact, Parasara, father of Vyasa, explici=
tly mentioned that Rama, Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha are "poornavataras" =
(used that exact expression) while other avataras have some amount of jivat=
mamsa too (though paramatmamsa dominates
 jivatmamsa).
>>>>>=C2=A0
>>>>>Sec=
ondly, after describing the avataras, SB says that there are in fact innume=
rable avataras and that all rishis, munis, manus, demigods etc are avataras=
 of Supreme Lord. It is under THAT context that 1.3.28 then proceeds to say=
 "these avataras are partial, while Krishna is Lord Himself." I question if=
 the deduction that Krishna *alone* is Lord Himself and Rama is not is accu=
rate! It only seems to say that all these rishis, manus, demigods etc are p=
artial. As I said above, Pararsara explicitly said that both Rama and Krish=

who is in reality formless (arUpa) and of the
 nature of pure consciousness=
 (chidAtman), are manufactured by the qualities of Maya". In the next verse=
, it further compares forms of Lord to clouds in sky and dirt in air. Just =
as sky *contains* clouds and is beyond them, similarly Lord *contains* form=
s and is beyond them. So, again, what is the meaning of a specific form tha=
t descended on earth being "Lord Himself"? I am afraid people may be misint=
erpreting this notion based on their fancies and conditioning..
>>>>>=C2=A0=

 This applies to Krishna as well as Rama.

>>>>>>1. In the Bhagwata Pura=

vatara is the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya is the 10th Avatara. Dattatreya, Nara=

the Supreme Being while Krshna is "swayam Bhagawan."
>>>>>>

>>>>>>2.=
 Of these various possible Avataras, 10, or rather 9 as I believe, are/have=
 been accorded special mention and significance across various Hindu spirit=
ual literature, specially those which were composed in the Kali-Yuga, namel=
y the Puranas.[When Krshna was alive, it was Kali-Sandhya, his physical pre=
sence had curtailed the full effect of Kali,once he left his body, Kali sta=
rted in full flow. All Puranas were composed after this, hence these are sc=
riptures of the Kali-Yuga, as are Tantras]
>>>>>>
>>>>>>
>>>>>>3. These 10/=
9 Avataras have a fixed sequence of appearance. Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, Nara=
simha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krshna, (Buddha) and Kalki. There is an u=
nmistakeable connection of the form and sequence of these main avatars with=
 the evolution of life on earth. From the aquatic, to the amphibian, to the=
 land-animal, to the half-animal-half-man, to the dwarf man (first human li=
fe form who immediately takes possession of this earth represented by Vaman=
a's 3 steps), to the Rajashik avatara of Parashurama moving around with an =
axe, to the Sattwa Guna Avatara of Rama, to the Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. =
Also, this indicates that spirituality is not to be separated into another =
world, but is a progressive realization of the various manifestation and po=
tentials that lie inherent in the consciousness and its development through=
 various life-forms. Larger spirituality of earth and evolution go hand in =
hand. That is Nature's grand design for life on
 earth.
>>>>>>

>>>>>=
>4. In this specifc context, I am only focusing on the parable of these mai=
n 9/10 Avatars. It is not my contention that if one worships say Matysa Ava=
tara, one will not attain to a state of liberation of the soul. As is the n=
ature of spiritual cosmology in Hinduism, any Devata can lead a person to a=
ny depth of realization. And each one of the Avatars of Vishnu are self-rea=
lized in their own way and can be consider super-massive spiritual dynamos.=

>>>>>>
>>>>>>
>>>>>>
>>>>>>=C2=A05. Of these, naturally, Rama and Krshna a=
re most adored because they represent a stage of evolution, both inside as =
well as outside, which society can relate of much easier, in this age. Rama=
 represents, for me, the stage of most satwic mind. A satwic mind is in con=
trol of itself. It known how to transform the animal tendencies within and =
without - monkeys - into a constructive force for a greater purpose. Howeve=
r, as with a state of full Sattwa Guna, there can be instances, even though=
 few, of dejection. For it is static in nature and will change only when ci=
rcumstances force it to. As per the Valmiki Ramayana, Rama did feel dejecte=
d while searching for Sita in the forest. He did have a moments fear before=
 the final assault on Ravana, which was dispelled by Agsatha when the later=
 revealed the stotra of the Sun to Rama. At the end of the final battle, Ra=
ma tells Sita, in a most dispassionate manner, that he killed Ravana not to=
 rescue her, but it
 was the Dharma to do so, and to unhold his family hono=
ur. That too was the dharma of that age when he lived, family honor. The wa=
y I look at this grand epic, and I bow humbly to the genius of Rishis Valmi=
ki for representing the things as they are, as a scribe, as a poet, as an o=
bserver, and not adding his own preferences to it anywhere, in the 14 years=
 of tribulation that Rama faced which culminated into his killing Ravana, h=
e changed into the most dispassionate leader, such that no personal conside=
ration or emotions or passions can overturn the Rajadharma. His life is a l=
esson of what a true leader must be! Krshna, OTOH, had this immaculate deta=
chment right from birth. I am not taking his=C2=A0 supernatural feats into =
account. It is his singular and constant detachment from situations, from p=
eople, from environment, from circumstances that mark his life. At the age =
of eight, he decides to leave Vrindavana for Mathura. All his friends, his =
foster parents,
 his village-folks who so loved him, pleaded with him that =
it would make no sense for him to leave the shelter, love and comfort of hi=
s happy, settled village life and head into an unknown destiny and destinat=
ion. Krshna tried to reason with them, then he understood that they won't u=
nderstand, he promised he will return back once his work in Mathura is over=
. He never returned. Later, much later, when the Gopis came to him asking h=
im to participate in their dance, he obliged. But the moment some of them s=
tarted getting jealous and possessive of Krshna, he removed himself quietly=
 from the scene, saying that he belongs to everyone equally and no one has =
any special right over him. When Shishupala abused Krshna, the later merely=
 kept dropping flowers on the floor, smiling and counting. The moment the 1=
00th abuse was over, he swiftly cut off Shishupala's head and was back into=
 his poise. But when Bhurishrava unfairly accused Krshna of being a revolut=
ionist
 and charlatan, Krshna did not kill him. When Duryodhana, who used t=
o think of Krshna as another black magician, wanted to arrest him, Krshna s=
howed his vikarala roopa in the assembly of kings, yet he did not finish th=
e enemies off. The very next moment he was back into his own poised self. N=
ever in the whole Mahabharata is there one instance of his going overboard,=
 never a single shade of depression, equivocation, or lack of confidence in=
 his actions, irrespective of what others say or think of him. And then rig=
ht in the middle of the greatest war he had the perfect equipoise to delive=
r the most sublime spiritual philosophy. That is why his life remains the b=
est ideal of Karma-Yoga. For a true Karma-Yogi by definition can never be d=
ejected. It is impossible. Neither the action nor the results belong to the=
 instrument. When running away from the battle-field and killing Kaliya Yav=
ana, or when advising Bheema to tear apart Jarashanda, or gesturing Bheema
=
 to hit Duryodhana below the waist, or getting Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Kr=
shna, as if by some Divine Intuition, knew exactly how the situations must =
be lined up which would cause the destruction of these people. This kind of=
 knowledge cannot come by the rational thinking. But happens when one is co=
nstantly and consciously connected to the Universal Force. We do not find t=
hese kind of complex situations in the Rama Avatara, at least in the Valmik=
i Ramayana. Of course, if we take the Adhbut Ramayana or such other auxilli=
ary texts and retelling, we get a different picture. In the Adbhuta Ramayan=
a we have a 1000 headed demon attacking Rama after he kills Ravana, and the=
n Sita turns into Adya Shakti and demolishes the 1000 headed demon and Rama=
 worships her. But if we take only the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the pi=
cture that emerges is very clear. Rama is the embodiment of Sattwic mind. T=
herefore he displays all the great characteristics of satwa, chief
 of whic=
h is self-control, as well as the occasional sadness caused due to separati=
on from his wife Sita whom, at least until Ravana was destroyed, he loved v=
ery dearly. Satwa guna creates a true saint, but can also cause some grief =
when the stability is shaken. Krshna was gunatita. He had no attachment to =
anything in this world - man, women, deva, danava, friend, enemy - and ther=
efore he was never affected any trace of negative emotion. His Ananda never=
 left him even in the most trying situations. 6. Buddha was great spiritual=
 force in this world. But I do not see him fit in the scheme of evolutionar=
y Avatars. His realization, the one he advocated, is a static realization, =
an end in a void. This is clearly denying of the reality of this earth. I f=
ind this not in tune with what either Rama or Krshna espoused. None of them=
 negated this world. If negation of this world and life is the final aim, t=
hen why send so many avatars at crucial stages of
 evolutionary development=
? If the spiritual impact on masses is the reason for Buddha being an Avata=
ra, then why not Jesus or Zorathrusta.? They are no less impactful in that =
sense. But do they fit in the scheme of spiritual line that these 9 Avatara=
s of Narayana indicate in a most logical manner? No. As such many vaishnava=
 traditions in parts of India, do not consider Buddha to be an avatara. Rea=
lization, to be complete and holistic, must be both static and dynamic, out=
side of life as well as inside of life. That is why the Tantras formed thei=
r own kind of spiritual philosophy, of the world as body of Shakti and ther=
efore an object of reverence and realization. 7. The original literature of=
 the Nath Yogis used to mention 9 chakras. These are centers of psychologic=
al functions. 6 inside the human body and 3 too subtle, or non-developed in=
 most people, even seekers. It is my belief that each of the 9 Avataras - e=
xcluding Buddha - correspond to the full
 power and force of one of these 9=
 Chakras. Similarly, the 9 grahas, or that which can modify consciousness o=
r allow the consciousness to explore and express itself is various possibli=
ties, are 9 in number. The lagna is a reference point and not a graha. Ther=
efore the chief Avatars who represent the parable of evolution are nine in =
number. And the ninth of the sequence is yet to come. 8. I cannot comment o=
n which graha would typically represent which Avatara. I know of what the B=
PHS says, however, it is my belief - feel free to disagree with it -:)[one =
cannot rule out some deep-rooted corruption of understanding or textual mis=
representation in this Kali-Yuga] - that the Atmah among the Avataras has n=
ot yet appeared. It will be Kalki, or as Vimalananda seems to say in the Ag=
hora books, Nishkalanka - the stainless one. There is only one thing which =
is perfectly stainless, the Atmah .After a Nirguna/Gunatita awastha comes l=
iving in the full and complete
 purity and might and force and strength of =
the Atmah. By the sheer dint of his purity the last Avatara will burn away =
opposing forces of this world and fulfill the purpose of evolution. Even Kr=
shna used diplomacy at various points in his adult life to achieve his ends=
. Kalki, I am speculating, won't even need that. The white horse and that s=
word is a metaphor. He will be the only one capable enough to rectify the v=
arious errors and corruptions that beset our age. Well, this is how I look =
at the story of Avataras. It is perfectly ok not to agree with my views, bu=
t I am reasonably sanguine now that this is what is closer to truth. -Regar=
