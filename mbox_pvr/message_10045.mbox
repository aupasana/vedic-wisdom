Namaste Sir,

Whether or not one is reborn is not based on whether there ar=
e more good or bad karmas. Instead, it is based on whether one has any unfu=
lfilled desires that one clings on to while leaving this realm of existence=
.

The last thought/desire harboured by the mind as one dies, becomes the s=
eed for the next birth. Based on the good and bad karmas one has, Nature la=
ys out the best possible path towards fulfilling that desire. One becomes f=
ree from rebirth only if one has no desires.

*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *

Let me give a hypothetical example to illustrate.

Su=
ppose a pious, learned and wealthy nobleman lives a very dharmik life, serv=
ing holy men, feeding the hungry, serving everyone around one and spreading=
 joy, knowledge and piety. Suppose there is a mango tree in his backyard an=
d he loves eating those mangoes. Suppose the mango season is upon him and h=
e sees one raw mango. Suppose he fancies eating it when it ripens and gets =
excited by the thought.

Suppose he dies then. Suppose his mind regrets at =
the last moment, "aha, I'm leaving without eating that mango!" One may then=
 be reborn as a fly on that tree and enjoy that mango.

*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *

But the pious karmas one has may take the fly=
 to a nice temple along with some flowers oneday and the fly may die there =
looking at god's idol and listening to the prayers and perhaps be born as a=
 priest fascinated by idols and prayers.

*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0 *

In scripture, you can see the story of how great virtuous e=
mperor Bharata was born as a deer and then as an unorthodox brahmin boy who=
 becomes liberated (Jada Bharata).

*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0 *

Of course, if one is nearly desireless, but one desire strikes at=
 the last moment and one is reborn, more desires can develop in that birth =
and one can get stuck indefinitely! It is very difficult to fathom the work=
ing of Karma and Nature..

If one really wants to be liberated, one should =
eventually develop dispassion and equal vision of all things. There is no o=
ther way.

If one gets carried away frequently by this and that thought, th=
is and that desire and this and that fancy, one is unlikely to be desireles=
s at the last moment. One needs to practice desirelessness throughout life.=


*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *

By the way, "good" and "=
bad" are subjective. A beautiful girl (or boy) chasing one with passion may=
 be desirable for some, but most undesirable for someone else.

>From Nature=
's point of view, every movement of consciousness that manipulates other ob=
jects in the field of duality is just a "karma", i.e. action, which deserve=
s an equal and opposite reaction from other objects in the field of duality=
. Nature optimizes the multi-variable problem of karma phalas to all jeevas=
!


Best regards,

Narasimha
