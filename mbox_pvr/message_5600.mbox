Namaste,
 
Only when the raw grains of scriptural guidelines are cooked in the water of experience on the fire of wisdom does one get something that can be digested. Some misconceptions are there in some sections of orthodox tradition. What you heard is not correct and go ahead with lighting the ghee lamp everyday.
 
Lakshmi, whether in the form of Dhana Lakshmi (wealth) or Dhanya lakshmi (grains and food) or Vidya Lakshmi (knowledge), should be shared with the world and put to good use. Then only Lakshmi will grow. If one selfishly keeps one's wealth or food or knowledge to oneself and keeps it *captive*, Lakshmi will not grow. Instead, Lakshmi will leave one then.
 
Never keep Lakshmi that you get captive. Share Her with others and put Her to good use. Then She will be pleased and do good to you.
 
The principle you heard is based on a misconception on how to handle Lakshmi.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
