Welcome to the lists as a contributor! I hope you will prove to be a worthy grandson.

Or it could be a combination of the two and not just one, i.e.
 
c) one's fate gave enough freedom to one's individual will. One used this freedom fully and exercised individual will to apply the remedy. In other words, fate did not force him to apply the remedy, but only *allowed* him to do so. The individual will applied the remedy. So it worked and pain went away.
 
Let me ask the philosopher in you one fundamental question: What was the original seed of the fate?
 
*        *        *
 
I want to say the following, at the risk of confusing some people.
 
At the deepermost level, all individuals are parts of the supreme cosmic being. Thus, individual will is part of the supreme cosmic will. For one who overcame individual ego, merged in the supreme and acting in the world as an observer-actor, i.e. for a jeevanmukta, there is nothing called individual will. The distinction between external and internal and between past and present is not there. All is god. For such a person, the distinction between fate and free is also non-existent. Universal will is running everything and there is no individual will.
 
But, those who do have an individual ego see the universe from that lens. To them, past and present as well as internal and external are quite distinct concepts. Hence fate (past actions seeming as an external factor and binding one now) and individual will (current actions seeming as an internal factor) seem quite distinct and there is a causal relationship between them.
 
A lot of conundrums of Hinduism are a result of indiscriminately mixing up concepts relevant to duality (the perspective of a bound person) with concepts relevant to non-duality (the perspective of a liberated person).
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
