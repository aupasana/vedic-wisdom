Namaste friends,
=A0
Some people wrote to me seeking my view on the recent =
discovery of "God Particle". Here is a brief comment.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Some people are falsely thinking that s=
cience and religion are about to converge finally. That is far from truth. =
Though it is nice of scientists to think of god when naming this particle, =
it has nothing to do with god really.
=A0
People believed that atom was ind=
ivisible. Then they found sub-atomic particles. Now they found an additiona=
l sub-atomic particle. A few hundred years later, they may find sub-sub-ato=
mic-particles that make up the sub-atomic particles. A few thousand years l=
ater, they may find sub-sub-sub-atomic-particles. And so on. There is no en=
d to this.
=A0
Nothing in this cosmos is an indivisible whole unit. No mate=
rial scientific discovery can ever be the be-all-end-all.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
As Maharshi Vasishtha alludes to in =
"Yoga Vaasishtham", there may even be many worlds inside each particle, wit=
h cosmic consciousness assuming various identities that are born, live and =
die within that particle!
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
 *
=A0
God is the supreme cosmic force that is responsible for the creation=
, maintenance and recycling of the entire cosmos with all of its worlds and=
 beings. God cannot be restricted to a particular object, be it a giant gal=
axy or a small sub-atomic particle. There is always something bigger than t=
he biggest you can imagine and smaller than the smallest you can imagine.
=
=A0
One will not truly find god as long as one looks for god in *matter*, j=
ust as one will not find a painter as long as one looks through the paintin=
gs by the painter. The paintings MAY capture some signature qualities, esse=
nce and basic nature of the painter, but the painter is beyond them. Simila=
rly, the material world around us may capture some signature qualities, ess=
ence and basic nature of god, but god is beyond the material world.
=A0

t regards,
Narasimha
