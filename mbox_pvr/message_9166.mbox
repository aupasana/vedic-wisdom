Namaste Sir,
=A0
Yes, Deva Tarpana and Rishi Tarpana are very useful in add=
ition to Pitri Tarpana.

=A0
If you actually look at the Pitri Tarpana manu=
als, you will see that Deva Tarpana and Rishi Tarpana are also included in =
the beginning!
=A0
Yes, not so long ago, these used to be part of Nitya kar=
ma (regular daily routine). A lot of people do not do them any more. If one=
 does atleast now and then, that will be good.
=A0
Compared to the other ri=
tuals, a simple Tarpana ritual (to devas, rishis and pitris) will take very=
 little time. Please check out the manuals at
=A0
http://www.VedicAstrologe=
r.org/tarpana

=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

 In addition to doing Amavasya tarpanam, if one has time(additional 20-25 m=
