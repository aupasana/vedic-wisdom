      Searching for Mother (a poem)

=C2=A0
PVR Narasimha Rao
2012 July 13
=C2=A0
Like a mad man, I was searchin=
g for Mother
Here and there, Everywhere
=C2=A0
I read many books,
I contemp=
lated so much,
I saw many scholars,
I saw many saints,
But I did not find H=
er
=C2=A0
Like a mad man, I was looking for Mother
Here and there, Everywhe=
re
=C2=A0
I went to many temples,
I did many rituals,
I tried many spiritua=
l paths,
I did much meditation,
But I did not find Her
=C2=A0
Like a mad ma=
n, I was looking for Mother
Here and there, Everywhere
=C2=A0
Then I realiz=
ed what was wrong
=C2=A0
I was restricting Mother
To what my mind could con=
ceive - 
A specific form with so many arms,
A specific type of Light,
A spe=
cific type of
 Energy,A specific ability to do this or that.
 
While lookin=
g for that form,
I missed out on Her
Though She was right in front of me
An=
d in fact all around me
In so many beautiful forms -
Some simple, some comp=
lex
=C2=A0
What makes a plant grow
And give flowers and fruits,
If not Her =
energy?
=C2=A0
What makes a flower bloom
And attract the bees,
If not Her e=
nergy?
=C2=A0
What attracts the bees
To the blooming flower,
If not Her ene=
rgy?
=C2=A0
What makes earth and
Planets go around Sun,
If not Her energy?
=
=C2=A0
What makes electrons in atoms
Go around the nucleus,
If not Her ener=
gy?
=C2=A0
What makes zillions of beings,
Zillions of atoms in them,
And zi=
llions of sub-aromic particles
Exist in a harmonious balance,
If not Her en=
ergy?
=C2=A0
What makes the us crave things,
What makes the us do
 things,
=
What makes the us understand things,
If not Her energy?
=C2=A0
Isn't She in=
 the contentment of a baby
Who just received milk from Mother?
Isn't She in=
 the love of Mother
Who just fed her baby?
Isn't She in the curiosity of a =
young toddler
About what is on the other side of a door?
Isn't She in the l=
aughters & cries,
Hunger & contentment, pleasures & pains
Of zillions of be=
ings in this cosmos?
=C2=A0
Now when I look around me,

I see Her all aroun=
d me.

I marvel at every little thing,

And every big thing,

As things of =
Her doing

And as signs of Her presence.

=C2=A0

I realized my mistake now=
..
=C2=A0
If you restrict Her to this or that definition,
You may not find =
Her however hard you may try
=C2=A0
She is the Force that creates, sustains=
 & recycles
Every being, every aspect of every being
And every notion in th=
e consciousness of every being
In this limitless cosmos!
=C2=A0
I realized =
my mistake now..
=C2=A0
You don't search for air with a microscope,
Air is =
all around us,
You just open your lungs to air and breath it!
=C2=A0
Same w=
ith Mother!
She is all around us,
Just open your heart to Her!
=C2=A0Best r=
egards,
Narasimha
