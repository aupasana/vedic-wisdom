Namaste friends,

There was a long friendly ;-) exchange between Rajarshi and me on Friday 
(July 29) on twitter on measuring spiritual caliber. This came from the 
context of Rajarshi's comments on the "maturity" & "errors" of 
Ramakrishna's disciples (regarding their attitude towards Tantra). He 
compared them with Vimalananda and said their spiritual caliber was of 
the scale of 2, while Vimalananda's was 2 power 16. He also talked about 
the hierarchy of spiritual caliber mentioned by V. I want to share 2 
cents of musings on that.

-------------------------------
Measuring Spiritual Caliber

Rajarshi, here are a few comments on your statements a couple of days 
back on Twitter comparing spiritual caliber. We can't even compare 
flowers like hibiscus, rose, jasmine, mogra, kewda, lotus etc & say 
which is a better flower. They have different properties like color, 
size, shape, number of petals, type/intensity of smell etc. Relative 
values depend on the purpose and they cannot be quantified universally. 
How can any sane person then say that spiritual caliber of different 
people can be compared and quanitified? The field of duality has 
infinite variety and the [self-]control of a yogi has infinite aspects 
to it. You cannot quantify the spiritual caliber of a person as one 
number and compare them.

Before one even attempts to understand Vimalananda's order (Paramahamsa 
< Siddha < Natha < Rishi), please note that different hierarchies exist 
in scriptures for deities also. Some consider a hierarchy of deities 
where Vishnu is supreme. Some consider a hierarchy of deities where 
Shiva is supreme. Some consider a hierarchy of deities where Shakti is 
supreme. And so on. None of them is absolute. All of them are relative 
and for specific purposes, i.e. from a specific perspective. There are 
people who take them as absolute and argue that so and so thing taught 
by Vishnu is superior to so and so thing taught by Shiva, etc. But we 
know that none of the hierarchies is absolute.

One who has the nerve to think that one can compare the wisdom of 
Jnaneshwar, dispassion of Ramana Maharshi, mad devotion of Ramakrishna 
Paramahamsa, detached activism of Vivekananda, compassion of Shirdi Sai, 
spiritual ecstasy of Vama Khepa, inner clarity of Lahiri Mahashaya, 
detachment of Trilinga Swami, purity of Tukaram, humility of Eknath 
Maharaj, ecstatic love of Meera Bai, motherly love of Gopaler Ma, etc, 
is a fool of the highest order. They can be compared from specific 
limited perspectives. In one thing, Tukaram may be superior to all, in 
another Jnaneshwar, in another Trilinga, in another Ramakrishna, and so 
on. You cannot compare in absolute terms. You should not even try to. 
You should just appreciate them individually and aspire to be like any 
of them that you like the most.

Vimalananda's list may be correct from specific perspective. More 
importantly, his words should make one realize that there is always 
scope for further self-control (and the resulting mastery over the field 
of duality) while one is still embodied. One should never rest and 
aspire for better self-control. But taking it as gospel and starting to 
judge yogis based on that is unwise. Especially making statements like 
"Vimalananda is heavier than all RK's discples put togtr" and thinking 
that something is absolute truth because Vimalananda is assumed to have 
said that (vs someone "lower than him") is unwise.

Even if Vimalananda's hierarchy is absolute and universal, don't assume 
that you can judge the stature of each yogi accurately. Because 
Ramakrishna was popularly known as a Paramahamsa, is he a Paramahamsa as 
per Vimalananda's classification or a siddha or a natha or even a rishi? 
Or may be a deity? My friend, don't assume you know for sure!!! Based on 
the details we know, can we be absolutely sure of even Vimalananda's 
stature based on his own classification?

You said "Approximating 2 equal to each disciples of ramakrishna. 2exp16 
= say Vimalananda. Basic?" You probably made this statement based on 
what you read and heard of Vimalananda. For the sake of argument, it is 
not even 100% clear whether he was a real person or an imagined 
character. Svoboda intentionally (and very wisely!) left the latter 
option open in the preface of his Aghora book!

If we MUST compare spiritual calibers, one possibility is to use a 
simpler definition of how close one is to liberation as a measure of 
one's "spiritual caliber", Ramakrishna's disciples fare quite well. RK 
told Abhedananda that it was going to be his last birth. Others would be 
back, but he would be liberated. To Yogananda, he said there would be 
one more birth and he would be free forever after that. Vimalananda, on 
the other hand, had atleast one more birth clearly as he said a body was 
waiting for him. That way, forget about "RK's discples put togtr", just 
Abhedananda alone is superior to Vimalananda!

Again, please note that this is just one definition. One can have many 
definitions. The key is not to jump to unwise conclusions on any 
hierarchies and say that "X is weightier than Y and so what he said must 
be more correct".

People with lopsided understanding of scriptures take relative knowledge 
to be absolute and jump to unwise conclusions. I am afraid some people 
are doing the same now with "modern scriptures" such as the Aghora 
books. Don't fall into the trap of taking something as gospel or as 
absolute. Written words are always relative and never absolute. 
Discriminate relative knowledge using intellect at first and hopefully 
using experencial realization later on.

More importantly, while we are still searching for "maturity", we should 
not commit the "error" of making negative judgmental comments of greats 
who did far more sadhana than us and experienced a lot more than us.
