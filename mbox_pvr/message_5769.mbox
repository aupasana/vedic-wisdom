Namaste,

Fasting on any day has no negative spiritual effects.

Irrespective of horoscope, if anybody fasts for a specific purpose 
(dharmik or otherwise reasonable purpose) and meditates at the end of 
the day, there is a decent chance to overcome problems over time, unless 
the blocking karmas are too serious.

*        *        *

After we eat food, all the agni (fire) in us is diverted to the stomach 
to digest the food. That is why one may feel sluggish after a heavy 
meal. As less energy is available for digestion of ideas in brain, one's 
intellectual alertness may be lower. Similarly, less agni is available 
for spiritual transformation in the subtle body, which is needed for 
reworking one's karma pipeline and obstacles in the subtle body. Thus, 
meditation done on a heavy stomach is ineffective.

If one fasts, more agni is available for that purpose. Thus, meditation 
after fasting can be effective. If one meditates with a mantra after 
fasting, the internal agni causes some spiritual transformation. Over 
time, it may rework the karma pipeline enough to remove a blocking karma 
from the head of the pipeline, to cause a blocked event to occur. When 
one focuses mind on a mantra and couples it with the force of a 
reasonably dhaarmik desire (e.g. getting married, getting a child, doing 
well in career etc), then some momentum is created to remove blocking 
karmas or atleast re-arrange karmas.

*        *        *

Technicalities are there to optimize the sadhana, but not to block one 
from sadhana. In fact, technicalities play a very minor role and 
moreover our understanding of many of them may very well be wrong! The 
key is to have mental focus and surrender to the Lord. It is the 
meditation done at the end of fasting that is the key. Do it with as 
intense a focus as you can mutter.

*        *        *

BTW, people with pitta and vaata constitutions should ideally not fast. 
They will end up aggravating pitta and vaata and the physical system is 
destabilized. To sustain spiritual transformation over time, physical 
well-being is also needed/useful. So do not push yourself. The goal of 
fasting is not to punish yourself so that someone in the sky becomes 
happy (nope, god is not a sadist) and grants you what you want. The goal 
of fasting is to create a situation where internal agni can work on your 
kaarmik blockages and rework the kaarmik pipeline enough. This is 
essentially an internal process happening in the subtle body and 
well-being of the gross physical body is also useful for supporting it.

So, for many people, partial fasting may be better than complete 
fasting. Take fruits and milk, which are easier to digest and are 
saattwik. Stay away from spices, fried things, meat and other complex 
foods. Sour fruits like oranges are a bad idea and take sweet fruits 
such as dates, bananas, sweet apples etc. In general, eat as little as 
you can, just to sustain yourself, and think of god during the whole day 
while doing other things. In the end, meditate as intensely as you can. 
That is how fasting can be effective.

Best regards,
Narasimha
