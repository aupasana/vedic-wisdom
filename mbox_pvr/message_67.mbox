Namaskar,
 
Quite seriously, please do not address me as a guru. Guru is a =
very heavy word. It means the remover of the darkness of ignorance. I am NO=
T a guru.
 
If She wants to answer something, She can pick someone and answ=
er through them. The person in question is just a nimitta.
 
Actually, Vasi=
shtha teaches that even a guru is a nimitta! Then what about someone like m=
e? Everything here is just a coincidence. She is the master planner. If She=
 wants something to be given to someone, she will select somebody else as a=
 nimitta for it and make the second person give that thing to the first per=
son. She is the energy that moves the entire universe. She is the ichcha sa=
kti (desire), kriya sakti (action) and jnaana sakti (knowledge) of each bei=
ng in this creation. It is amazing how She plans the whole thing.
 
She is =
like a master film director who is making a secretive magnum opus. Imagine =
a director who has a really complicated script and shoots one scene with on=
e set of actors and another scene with another set of actors etc. Each acto=
r only knows the scenes (s)he is in. No actor can figure out the complete s=
tory from the few scenes that (s)he knows. The Mother is like that. She has=
 a beautiful screenplay and we are all actors playing out roles. We only kn=
ow a little bit of the story.
 
Some people become too attached to the play=
 and start wondering what the complete story is. They waste their time and =
energy wondering what the complete story is or what the next scene is. This=
 does not improve their performance in their own scenes even one bit. On th=
e contrary, this guesswork sometimes biases them and they end up messing up=
 their own scenes due to the mistakened biases.
 
Now take an actor who lea=
ves it completely to the director, resigns to the mastery of the director a=
nd just does what (s)he is told to do. Such an actor gives a perfect perfor=
mance and does not waste any time or energy in unnecessary activities. Simi=
larly, one who realizes Her mastery and realizes that She is the doer of ev=
erything and considers oneself a pawn in the hand of a master chess player =
does not over-analyze everything and leads a blissful and fruitful life and=
 serves Her agenda perfectly.
 
This is not a direct comment on what you sa=
id, but an extension of the previous streams of thought...
 
Thank you for =
your blessings.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

    Dear Ki=
shore,

    There are so many practices that are geared towards creating di=
scipline, reducing ego, overcoming the inner enemies and purifying oneself.=


    Any practice will do. However, depending on who one was earlier and w=
hat one did earlier, one may experience different levels of affinity toward=
s different practices and also get results at different speeds with differe=
nt practices.

    Normal people can only give you good advice from THEIR p=
erspective. They cannot give you advice from YOUR perspective. Only a sadgu=
ru, who knows more about the real you than you yourself do, can give you ad=
vice from your perspective. Unfortunately, I am  not one.

    If you want =
my suggestion nevertheless, here are some basic suggestions.

    (1) In "Y=
oga Vaasishtham", Maharshi Vasishtha prescribes company of saints as the fi=
rst step in acquiring self-knowledge. Spend some time every week with spiri=
tually inclined people discussing spiritual matters.

    (2) Identify one =
personal weakness (e.g. anger, jealosy). Make a sincere effort to overcome =
it. Whenever the weakness strikes you (e.g. you become angry), consciously =
restrain yourself and divert your mind to something else (e.g. repeating a =
mantra).

    (3) Take a mantra (e.g. Gayatri mantra). Spend atleast 30 min=
utes everyday repeating that mantra. Sit comfortably with a reasonably stra=
ight back and closed eyes and repeat the mantra. If your mind wanders off t=
he mantra and its deity and you get distracted by all kinds of thoughts, do=
 not worry. Accept it as the nature of mind and make a conscious effort to =
pull the mind back into the mantra and its deity.

    (4) Before that japa=
, do a simple pranayama for 5 minutes. Breath in through the right nostril =
for n seconds, breath out through the left nostril for n seconds, breath in=
 through the same left nostril for another n seconds and then breath out th=
rough the right nostril for n seconds. Keep the time duration - n seconds -=
 approximately the same in all steps. If you want, you can use a small mant=
ra as the measure of time and say it mentally in each step. Keep repeating =
this sequence for 5 minutes.

    (5) Cultivate the thinking that you do no=
t own anything. Think that you are just a *temporary caretaker* of things t=
hat seem like your possessions (e.g. you relations, your house, your car an=
d even your own body, name, fame etc). Tell yourself that all these are god=
's property and that you are servant and a temporary caretaker. Just as a s=
ervant working at a rich man's house takes excellent care of things entrust=
ed to him without developing the "it is mine" attachment to the things, tel=
l yourself that you too have to take excellent care of all the things entru=
sted to you (e.g. your relations, your house, your car, your body, name, fa=
me etc) while cultivating the "it is god's and not mine" sense.

    This i=
s a very important step and just keep on trying if you keep failing.

    (=
6) Read a little of some scripture or teachings of a holy man everyday. Exa=
mples are BhagavadGita, Jnaneshwari etc. I particularly recommend "Gospel o=
f Ramakrishna". Ramakrishna Parahamahamsa was a great master who taught the=
 highest knowledge in simplest terms to all kinds of people. Read his teach=
ings with an open mind, understand them and try to follow them.

    *     =
   *        *

    If some previous karmas are blocking one's spiritual pro=
gress, one has to either burn those karmas through sadhana or experience th=
e result of the karmas. Then only the blockage will go away. There is no ot=
her way.

    Each minute spent in spiritual sadhana - including japam, hom=
am etc - contributes to that. No effort is wasted. One should never get dis=
heartened.

    Best regards,
    Narasimha

      Dear PVR,

=
      There is a profound gravitation towards the knowledge flowing here. F=
rom the sidelines, I aspire to learn the basics to better understand your m=
essages. In your previous mails you suggested Ganapathi Homam as a daily ri=
tual. Your messages convey a concept that there are umpteen paths to vedic =
wisdom. For starters can you please give a list of readings and daily pract=
ices. It could be due to lack of initiation or laziness if we cannot do Hom=
am what do you think we should start with. 

      Namaste,

 is a profound 
      gravitation towards the knowledge flowing here. From =
the sidelines, I 
      aspire to learn the basics to better understand you=
r messages. In your 
      previous mails you suggested Ganapathi Homam as =
a daily ritual. Your 
      messages convey a concept that there are umptee=
n paths to vedic wisdom. 
      For starters can you please give a list of =
readings and daily practices. 
      It could be due to lack of initiation =
or laziness if we cannot do Homam 
      what do you think we should start =
with. <BR><BR>Namaste,<BR>-Kishore.
