Namaste friends,

Thanks to Rajarshi for the well-written, insp=
iring and excellent series on his experiences with Manish at Kashi.

Krishn=
endu, I can understand where you are coming from. However, there is one mor=
e angle to consider.

Manish told me long back that we should guard against=
 focusing on "personalities" and building awe. He said we should focus on s=
adhana. He said, "my message is not that I am special, but it is that every=
one is special. My assertion is not that I found god, but it is that everyo=
ne can and should find god. I am a normal person. If I could find god, anyb=
ody could. As people do homam sincerely and unselfishly for a few years, th=
ere will be many people who make great progress. World will be a changed pl=
ace."

Manish said, "people should do sadhana. Don't waste time when you ar=
e on earth. Never give the excuse that you don't know how to do sadhana. Do=
 whatever you can. If you know how to do homam, do homam. Otherwise do japa=
m. Or you can sit down and do a bhajan chanting god's name. Do some sadhana=
 or the other for as much time as you can. Don't worry about the results, b=
ut keep doing sadhana to the best of your ability."

*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

I have personally =
seen clear indications that Manish operates on a different plane compared t=
o most people. I will give a few small examples in this writeup. However, I=
 want to re-iterate that Manish does not see himself as a special person or=
 a "man of god" as you say, but sees himself as a small instrument of Natur=
e.

When I mention any supernatural things involving Manish, the goal is to=
 show that such things are possible even now and not just limited to books =
and stories. As Rajarshi wisely said, we "educated city people" lack faith.=
 True, skepticism is useful as a lot of fake people do exploit the blind fa=
ith of people, but the pendulum has swung too far and educated people have =
lost faith so completely that it is almost cynical.

This is like lazy peop=
le of a village who do not have the energy and patience to climb a hill nex=
t to the village refusing to believe that anybody can climb that hill. Thus=
, if someone climbs the hill, finds something nice on the hill and wants to=
 inspire others to climb it, such accounts will be inspiring.

The goal is =
to inspire and enable a group of spiritual aspirants to do sadhana, become =
powerful instruments of Nature and end up inspiring many more people. The u=
ltimate goal is to uphold Veda dharma of rishis in the world.

When w=
e went to Calcutta to visit Dakshineshwar, we stayed near the Kalighat temp=
le. We could not find a hotel room as hotels were full and someone at a tem=
ple referred us to a nearby house that was being converted to a lodge. Hous=
e owners lived upstairs. We checked in our luggage downstairs. Manish told =
me, "we have a rina with this couple. His wife is very sincere and spiritua=
l. We need to do something." We met his wife later and saw her horoscope. S=
he was indeed quite spiritual. She is a worshipper of Sarada Mata and Ramak=
rishna Paramahamsa and a regular visitor of Ramakrishna Mutt.

Manish showe=
d a very tall wall on one side of that property and asked them, "is there a=
 smashaan (cemetary) on the other side of that wall". They said no. Manish =
said, "hmm, it somehow feels like that." That person clarified then, "it is=
 a house and not a smashaan, but this house was a small mosque several deca=
des ago and they supposedly buried several people of that large family in t=
he backyard itself." After all, Manish's "perception" was correct.

BTW, we=
 two ended up doing two simultaneous Ganapathi homas on the next night next=
 to that wall.

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

On his advice, one lady started chanting Chandipath e=
veryday to solve some problem with her son, which was bothering her very mu=
ch.

Oneday Manish talked to her daughter. He asked her, "what is your moth=
er doing? She is doing Chandipath alright, but she is asking for weird thin=
gs. Check with her and ask her to stop asking those things."

When she corn=
ered her mother on what she was asking, her mother finally revealed that sh=
e was frustrated with the situation with her son and so was asking Devi at =
the time of Chandipath to take her life so that she does not have to see he=
r son's situation.

Her daughter straightened her out and she stopped that.=
 As a postscript, her son's problem was solved after she did Chandipath for=
 a few more weeks.

=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

Manish told me a few times that he "knows" when so=
meone thinks of him.

When we were staying at a hotel in Kurukshetra, Manis=
h said to me one evening, "the hotel owner is thinking of me right now. He =
is thinking about me and money." Interestingly, phone in the room rang in a=
 minute and it was the hotel owner. He called to ask if we wanted to pay fo=
r the next day ahead instead of paying in the morning.

Manish came to =
Seatle, USA for a conference in fall 2005 and I met him physically for the =
first time then. After lunch, we were walking around. Suddenly, Manish decl=
ared, "there is a rudraaksha maalaa meant for your son close to here. I can=
 sense it. Let us go and find it." We walked quite a distance. Then he said=
, "this is the place." There was a big country market kind of place in a sm=
all shopping complex. We went in, but found nothing. We came out of the com=
plex. Manish looked around and said, "no, this is the place. I was confused=
 by the smell from the fish market inside this complex. Let us try again." =
We went in again and this time Manish took me inside a small alley and ther=
e was a small mom & pop kind of shop selling some Tibetan things. They had =
several Rudraaksha maalaas. Manish picked one, bought it and gave it for my=
 son.

*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0 *

I mentioned this earlier. Manish told me oneday that he "saw m=
e" doing my daily Chandi homam while he was driving fast on a highway in UK=
. He lifted one hand in abhaya mudra (blessing pose) while driving. His wif=
e asked what he was doing. He said he told her, "Narasimha is doing homam r=
ight now. I am blessing him."

When he mentioned this, I wanted to verify i=
t. I normally wear red or yellow or white veshti and anga vastram (lower cl=
oth and upper cloth) for my homam. That day I was wearing a blue veshti and=
 a blue T-shirt. I was gifted that blue veshti by a priest and wore it only=
 twice until now. So one is unlikely to *guess* this. I asked him, "if you =
saw me, tell me what kind of clothes I was wearing." He said, "Narasimha, i=
t seemed like some shade of blue. You were wearing a T-shirt and it was als=
o another shade of blue." He was correct. If one was merely guessing it, th=
e probability of getting is correct was very very small - almost zero.

When we went to Pune, Delhi and Kurukshetra for the Krishna movie shooti=
ng, it rained heavily. In May, it was a bit early for the monsoon rains. Wh=
en we reached the temple at Mayapur, Manish said that nature was pleased wi=
th the work on Krishna and rains wherever we went was a sign. Sometimes Man=
ish says big-sounding things like this, which may give an impression that h=
e is proud. But I realized that it is not because of pride, but he was simp=
ly making observations from the plane he is in. From where others are, they=
 may sound weird or proud or pretentious.

I kind of dismissed him, "well, =
it could be a coincidence. It is very hot here right now and I see no cloud=
s anywhere. If it rains here today, I will believe your theory."

Manish se=
riously looked at the sky and nodded his head. Because it was too hot, we r=
etired into our room at the accommodation there, unpacked our stuff and got=
 tripod etc ready. Within ten minutes, we heard loud thunders. In a few min=
utes, there was a heavy thunderstorm that lasted half an hour. There were p=
uddles of water everywhere. Manish remarked, "see, it rained here also. God=
s are happy with this work. This film is an important work." The rest of th=
e day and next day was perfect and we shot what we wanted.

During Ma=
rch 2006 Shata Chandi homam at the Kaalikambal temple in Chennai where Moth=
er gave a darshan to Manish and asked to start a homam movement, I was medi=
tating in the garbhalaya one evening, sitting in front of Manish. We were b=
oth meditating on Savitri Gayatri mantra. After half hour or so, I lost nor=
mal awareness of my body and I felt like I was some all-pervading orange li=
ght. I saw that there was a person at the center of that light, who was emi=
ting that light. When I looked closer, it was Manish. After a little time, =
he suddenly transformed into a very famous saint from the past. I wondered =
"why did Manish change into that saint". That disturbed my focus and my reg=
ular self-awareness returned and I became aware that I was Narasimha medita=
ting in that garbhalaya and Manish was sitting in front of me. I opened my =
eyes. At the same time, Manish also opened his eyes. Without my saying anyt=
hing, he asked "you saw me, no?" I was surprised that he
 knew it. However,=
 what baffled me the most was why he transformed into that saint. I stutter=
ed, "but...". Without my finishing it, he remarked, "you see Narasimha, the=
 blessings of my guru of last life are still with me. That is why you saw h=
im in me!" He not only knew what I saw, but explained it succintly.

=
I was sleeping oneday. In the middle of the night, I woke up. When I was st=
ill on the bed and partially awake, my shakti rose. In other words, my self=
-awareness got refined. I first perceived a tremendous bolt of electricity =
going up in my back. Then, in a split second, my perception of that electri=
city changed from "shakti inside me" to "I inside shakti". My changed perce=
ption was that there was a tremendous amount of shakti that was surging up =
like an ocean wave and encompassing everything that was there and that I wa=
s a very tiny particle in that tremendous wave. Moreover, I also "heard" a =
specific beejaakshara being chanted together by millions of people, who wer=
e all tiny particles in that wave. That wave reverberated with the sound of=
 that beejaakshara and I perceived that I too was chanting that beejaakshar=
a along with all. My mind was filled with that sound and a kind of bliss. M=
y self-awareness was that of a tiny particle filled with that sound
 and jo=
y and nothing else. I was unaware of anything else. Compared to my normal m=
ental state, it was a very simple and yet fantastic state to be in. I was i=
n that state for a while. Suddenly a thought that can be loosely expressed =
as "Amn't I on the bed in a room? How am I hearing this loud sound? Are the=
re people in the room" came to my mind. That thought disturbed the state of=
 my mind and my shakti came down. In other words, I returned to the regular=
 level of self-awareness and again perceived that I was a body lying on a b=
ed in a room. The bliss was gone and mind was again filled with hundreds of=
 thoughts as usual.
=C2=A0
I mentioned this incident a few days later to Ma=
nish. When this happened, it was the middle of the night for me and morning=
 for Manish. When I mentioned the incident and said that I heard the sound =
of a beejaakshara reverberating in the wave in which I was a small particle=
, Manish immediately said he knew it and also mentioned the specific beejaa=
kshara and asked "that is what you heard, right?" That was indeed correct. =
Moreover, I had never meditated with that beejaakshara before and it is not=
 something one would expect me to have a mystical experience with.

When I =
confirmed that was the beejaakshara I heard, Manish shed some light: "I was=
 at that time meditating with that beejaakshara. So and so deity came and f=
illed my consciousness. I then went into a nice samadhi. Some people close =
to me may also have experienced that deity at that time. But we should real=
ize that this is all Her play and we are just nimittas. What she does and w=
hy she does, she knows and we do not. We are just dummies observing what co=
mes our way. We neither make anything happen nor should we desire anything =
to happen. Just be and observe. Do not be attracted or repelled by anything=
."

=C2=A0 *

When Manish called me in mid-2004, he told me, "You are doing goo=
d work by giving free astrology software and doing several poojas, but you =
are not experiencing anything. Time has now come for your Kundalini to awak=
en and for you to start experiencing things". I thought he was crazy. He se=
nt me a Rudraaksha maalaa and asked me to do 2x108 times Gayatri mantra eve=
ryday using that maalaa while maintaining brahmacharya (celibacy) and keepi=
ng the back straight and without any body movement at all. I ignored the Ru=
draaksha maalaa sent by him for many months before starting the practice he=
 wanted in May 2005. I experienced something very intense, powerful, profou=
nd and life changing within 18 days of starting the practice.

When I menti=
oned what happened to him, he laughed and said, "now an irreversible transf=
ormation has been kicked off". He said, "we two were born together many tim=
es. Even if you think I am crazy, you cannot leave me and will be pulled to=
wards me. Such is our relationship. You don't know who you are and who I am=
, but I do." He also told me then about his first phone call to me in 2004:=
 "I did not have your phone number but wanted to connect with you. When I w=
as in a trance after meditation, I simply picked up the phone and dialed wh=
atever digits my hand felt like pressing. Then I got you on the phone."

Th=
ough I still thought he was crazy, I knew that what I had experienced was t=
oo profound and the coincidence that it happened soon after starting to use=
 his maalaa was too strong, to ignore. I started to wonder if he was genuin=
e after all, but his manner of speaking was still too weird for me. I never=
 hid my thoughts from him and shared freely.

My journey since then has bee=
n very interesting and I have shared parts of it on this yahoogroup. Someon=
e said Rajarshi's mails reminded of Vimalananda. There is indeed something =
Vimalananda- like about Manish. In fact, Manish says he is like a spiritual=
 son to Vimalananda and holds Vimalananda in great esteem. I don't know Vim=
alananda, but I know Manish and I can imagine several things mentioned by V=
imalananda in "Aghora" series books being correct.

Despite some of his sup=
ernatural abilities that I have seen, like the ability to create a specific=
 mystical experience in someone thousands of miles away, he insists that De=
vi does everything and he is just a small instrument and an observer of Dev=
i's leelaa and a small player in the big game of chess being played by Devi=
. In fact, his main teaching to me was to improve devotion, faith and surre=
nder and give up doership of my actions.

His teachings are sublime and yet=
 practical. He is not content to explain theory, but practically demonstrat=
es the weaknesses of mind and how to overcome them. Instead of swimming in =
modern pseudo-vedanta, he made me understand and appreciate duality and non=
-duality at the same time. He made me understand things through experience.=
 He brought great change in my attitude and thinking in the last 5.5 years =
of interaction. He destroyed my biases and expanded the horizons of my unde=
rstanding and gave a much better perspective.

Most importantly, using me a=
s an instrument, he enabled many sincere spiritual seekers to embrace the a=
ncient Vedic sadhana of rishis - homam or fire ritual for saattwik purposes=
. He tells me that one lakh (one hundred thousand) people will be doing hom=
am on a regular basis one hundred years from now.

As I said at the beginni=
ng of this email, inspiring sadhana is more important than inspiring awe re=
garding specific personalities, though the latter sometimes helps with the =
former.

=A0=C2=A0 *

I will conclude with Manish's words I mentioned before:

"My m=
essage is not that I am special, but it is that everyone is special. My ass=
ertion is not that I found god, but it is that everyone can and should find=
 god. I am a normal person. If I could find god, anybody could. As people d=
o homam sincerely and unselfishly for a few years, there will be many peopl=
e who make great progress. World will be a changed place."

"People should =
do sadhana. Don't waste time when you are on earth. Never give the excuse t=
hat you don't know how to do sadhana. Do whatever you can. If you know how =
to do homam, do homam. Otherwise do japam. Or you can sit down and do a bha=
jan chanting god's name. Do some sadhana or the other for as much time as y=
ou can. Don't worry about the results, but keep doing sadhana to the best o=
f your ability."

Best regards,
Narasimha

 to consider.<BR><BR>Manish told me long back that we should guard against =
focusing on "personalities" and building awe. He said we should focus on sa=
dhana. He said, "my message is not that I am special, but it is that everyo=
ne is special. My assertion is not that I found god, but it is that everyon=
e can and should find god. I am a normal person. If I could find god, anybo=
dy could. As people do homam sincerely and unselfishly for a few years, the=
re will be many people who make great progress. World will be a changed pla=
ce."<BR><BR>Manish said, "people should do sadhana. Don't waste time when y=
ou are on earth. Never give the excuse that you don't know how to do sadhan=
a. Do whatever you can. If you know how to do
 homam, do homam. Otherwise d=
o japam. Or you can sit down and do a bhajan chanting god's name. Do some s=
adhana or the other for as much time as you can. Don't worry about the resu=
lts, but keep doing sadhana to the best of your ability."<BR><BR>* &nb=
sp;     *       *<BR><BR>=
I have personally seen clear indications that Manish operates on a differen=
t plane compared to most people. I will give a few small examples in this w=
riteup. However, I want to re-iterate that Manish does not see himself as a=
 special person or a "man of god" as you say, but sees himself as a small i=
nstrument of Nature.<BR><BR>When I mention any supernatural things involvin=
g Manish, the goal is to show that such things are possible even now and no=
t just limited to books and stories. As Rajarshi wisely said, we "educated =
city people" lack faith. True, skepticism is useful as a lot of fake people=
 do exploit the blind faith of people,
 but the pendulum has swung too far =
and educated people have lost faith so completely that it is almost cynical=
.<BR><BR>This is like lazy people of a village who do not have the energy a=
nd patience to climb a hill next to the village refusing to believe that an=
ybody can climb that hill. Thus, if someone climbs the hill, finds somethin=
g nice on the hill and wants to inspire others to climb it, such accounts w=
ill be inspiring.<BR><BR>The goal is to inspire and enable a group of spiri=
tual aspirants to do sadhana, become powerful instruments of Nature and end=
 up inspiring many more people. The ultimate goal is to uphold Veda dharma =
of rishis in the world.<BR><BR>*       * =
;      *<BR><BR>When we went to Calcutta to visit =
Dakshineshwar, we stayed near the Kalighat temple. We could not find a hote=
l room as hotels were full and someone at a temple referred us to a nearby =
house that was being converted
 to a lodge. House owners lived upstairs. We=
 checked in our luggage downstairs. Manish told me, "we have a rina with th=
is couple. His wife is very sincere and spiritual. We need to do something.=
" We met his wife later and saw her horoscope. She was indeed quite spiritu=
al. She is a worshipper of Sarada Mata and Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and a re=
gular visitor of Ramakrishna Mutt.<BR><BR>Manish showed a very tall wall on=
 one side of that property and asked them, "is there a smashaan (cemetary) =
on the other side of that wall". They said no. Manish said, "hmm, it someho=
w feels like that." That person clarified then, "it is a house and not a sm=
ashaan, but this house was a small mosque several decades ago and they supp=
osedly buried several people of that large family in the backyard itself." =
After all, Manish's "perception" was correct.<BR><BR>BTW, we two ended up d=
oing two simultaneous Ganapathi homas on the next night next to that
 wall.=
<BR><BR>*       *    &nbs=
p;  *<BR><BR>On his advice, one lady started chanting Chandipath every=
day to solve some problem with her son, which was bothering her very much.<=
BR><BR>Oneday Manish talked to her daughter. He asked her, "what is your mo=
ther doing? She is doing Chandipath alright, but she is asking for weird th=
ings. Check with her and ask her to stop asking those things."<BR><BR>When =
she cornered her mother on what she was asking, her mother finally revealed=
 that she was frustrated with the situation with her son and so was asking =
Devi at the time of Chandipath to take her life so that she does not have t=
o see her son's situation.<BR><BR>Her daughter straightened her out and she=
 stopped that. As a postscript, her son's problem was solved after she did =
Chandipath for a few more weeks.<BR><BR>*     &nbs=
p; *       *<BR><BR>Manish told
 me a few tim=
es that he "knows" when someone thinks of him.<BR><BR>When we were staying =
at a hotel in Kurukshetra, Manish said to me one evening, "the hotel owner =
is thinking of me right now. He is thinking about me and money." Interestin=
gly, phone in the room rang in a minute and it was the hotel owner. He call=
ed to ask if we wanted to pay for the next day ahead instead of paying in t=
he morning.<BR><BR>*       *   =
;    *<BR><BR>Manish came to Seatle, USA for a conference in=
 fall 2005 and I met him physically for the first time then. After lunch, w=
e were walking around. Suddenly, Manish declared, "there is a rudraaksha ma=
alaa meant for your son close to here. I can sense it. Let us go and find i=
t." We walked quite a distance. Then he said, "this is the place." There wa=
s a big country market kind of place in a small shopping complex. We went i=
n, but found nothing. We came out of the complex.
 Manish looked around and=
 said, "no, this is the place. I was confused by the smell from the fish ma=
rket inside this complex. Let us try again." We went in again and this time=
 Manish took me inside a small alley and there was a small mom & pop ki=
nd of shop selling some Tibetan things. They had several Rudraaksha maalaas=
. Manish picked one, bought it and gave it for my son.<BR><BR>*  =
     *       *<BR><BR>I m=
entioned this earlier. Manish told me oneday that he "saw me" doing my dail=
y Chandi homam while he was driving fast on a highway in UK. He lifted one =
hand in abhaya mudra (blessing pose) while driving. His wife asked what he =
was doing. He said he told her, "Narasimha is doing homam right now. I am b=
lessing him."<BR><BR>When he mentioned this, I wanted to verify it. I norma=
lly wear red or yellow or white veshti and anga vastram (lower cloth and up=
per cloth) for my homam. That day I was
 wearing a blue veshti and a blue T=
-shirt. I was gifted that blue veshti by a priest and wore it only twice un=
til now. So one is unlikely to *guess* this. I asked him, "if you saw me, t=
ell me what kind of clothes I was wearing." He said, "Narasimha, it seemed =
like some shade of blue. You were wearing a T-shirt and it was also another=
 shade of blue." He was correct. If one was merely guessing it, the probabi=
lity of getting is correct was very very small - almost zero.<BR><BR>* =

<BR>When we went to Pune, Delhi and Kurukshetra for the Krishna movie shoot=
ing, it rained heavily. In May, it was a bit early for the monsoon rains. W=
hen we reached the temple at Mayapur, Manish said that nature was pleased w=
ith the work on Krishna and rains wherever we went was a sign. Sometimes Ma=
nish says big-sounding things like this, which may give an impression that =
he is proud. But I realized that
 it is not because of pride, but he was si=
mply making observations from the plane he is in. From where others are, th=
ey may sound weird or proud or pretentious.<BR><BR>I kind of dismissed him,=
 "well, it could be a coincidence. It is very hot here right now and I see =
no clouds anywhere. If it rains here today, I will believe your theory."<BR=
><BR>Manish seriously looked at the sky and nodded his head. Because it was=
 too hot, we retired into our room at the accommodation there, unpacked our=
 stuff and got tripod etc ready. Within ten minutes, we heard loud thunders=
. In a few minutes, there was a heavy thunderstorm that lasted half an hour=
. There were puddles of water everywhere. Manish remarked, "see, it rained =
here also. Gods are happy with this work. This film is an important work." =
The rest of the day and next day was perfect and we shot what we wanted. <B=

  *<BR><BR>During
 March 2006 Shata Chandi homam at the Kaalikambal te=
mple in Chennai where Mother gave a darshan to Manish and asked to start a =
homam movement, I was meditating in the garbhalaya one evening, sitting in =
front of Manish. We were both meditating on Savitri Gayatri mantra. After h=
alf hour or so, I lost normal awareness of my body and I felt like I was so=
me all-pervading orange light. I saw that there was a person at the center =
of that light, who was emiting that light. When I looked closer, it was Man=
ish. After a little time, he suddenly transformed into a very famous saint =
from the past. I wondered "why did Manish change into that saint". That dis=
turbed my focus and my regular self-awareness returned and I became aware t=
hat I was Narasimha meditating in that garbhalaya and Manish was sitting in=
 front of me. I opened my eyes. At the same time, Manish also opened his ey=
es. Without my saying anything, he asked "you saw me, no?" I was surprised =
that he knew it.
 However, what baffled me the most was why he transformed =
into that saint. I stuttered, "but...". Without my finishing it, he remarke=
d, "you see Narasimha, the blessings of my guru of last life are still with=
 me. That is why you saw him in me!" He not only knew what I saw, but expla=
ined it succintly.<BR><BR>*       * &nbs=
p;     *<BR><BR>I was sleeping oneday. In the middle of=
 the night, I woke up. When I was still on the bed and partially awake, my =
shakti rose. In other words, my self-awareness got refined. I first perceiv=
ed a tremendous bolt of electricity going up in my back. Then, in a split s=
econd, my perception of that electricity changed from "shakti inside me" to=
 "I inside shakti". My changed perception was that there was a tremendous a=
mount of shakti that was surging up like an ocean wave and encompassing eve=
rything that was there and that I was a very tiny particle in that tremendo=
us wave.
 Moreover, I also "heard" a specific beejaakshara being chanted to=
gether by millions of people, who were all tiny particles in that wave. Tha=
t wave reverberated with the sound of that beejaakshara and I perceived tha=
t I too was chanting that beejaakshara along with all. My mind was filled w=
ith that sound and a kind of bliss. My self-awareness was that of a tiny pa=
rticle filled with that sound and joy and nothing else. I was unaware of an=
ything else. Compared to my normal mental state, it was a very simple and y=
et fantastic state to be in. I was in that state for a while. Suddenly a th=
ought that can be loosely expressed as "Amn't I on the bed in a room? How a=
m I hearing this loud sound? Are there people in the room" came to my mind.=
 That thought disturbed the state of my mind and my shakti came down. In ot=
her words, I returned to the regular level of self-awareness and again perc=
eived that I was a body lying on a bed in a room. The bliss was gone and mi=
nd
 was again filled with hundreds of thoughts as usual.<BR> <BR>I men=
tioned this incident a few days later to Manish. When this happened, it was=
 the middle of the night for me and morning for Manish. When I mentioned th=
e incident and said that I heard the sound of a beejaakshara reverberating =
in the wave in which I was a small particle, Manish immediately said he kne=
w it and also mentioned the specific beejaakshara and asked "that is what y=
ou heard, right?" That was indeed correct. Moreover, I had never meditated =
with that beejaakshara before and it is not something one would expect me t=
o have a mystical experience with.<BR><BR>When I confirmed that was the bee=
jaakshara I heard, Manish shed some light: "I was at that time meditating w=
ith that beejaakshara. So and so deity came and filled my consciousness. I =
then went into a nice samadhi. Some people close to me may also have experi=
enced that deity at that time. But we should realize that this is all
 Her =
play and we are just nimittas. What she does and why she does, she knows an=
d we do not. We are just dummies observing what comes our way. We neither m=
ake anything happen nor should we desire anything to happen. Just be and ob=
serve. Do not be attracted or repelled by anything."<BR><BR>*  &n=
bsp;    *       *<BR><BR>When =
Manish called me in mid-2004, he told me, "You are doing good work by givin=
g free astrology software and doing several poojas, but you are not experie=
ncing anything. Time has now come for your Kundalini to awaken and for you =
to start experiencing things". I thought he was crazy. He sent me a Rudraak=
sha maalaa and asked me to do 2x108 times Gayatri mantra everyday using tha=
t maalaa while maintaining brahmacharya (celibacy) and keeping the back str=
aight and without any body movement at all. I ignored the Rudraaksha maalaa=
 sent by him for many months before starting the practice he
 wanted in May=
 2005. I experienced something very intense, powerful, profound and life ch=
anging within 18 days of starting the practice.<BR><BR>When I mentioned wha=
t happened to him, he laughed and said, "now an irreversible transformation=
 has been kicked off". He said, "we two were born together many times. Even=
 if you think I am crazy, you cannot leave me and will be pulled towards me=
. Such is our relationship. You don't know who you are and who I am, but I =
do." He also told me then about his first phone call to me in 2004: "I did =
not have your phone number but wanted to connect with you. When I was in a =
trance after meditation, I simply picked up the phone and dialed whatever d=
igits my hand felt like pressing. Then I got you on the phone."<BR><BR>Thou=
gh I still thought he was crazy, I knew that what I had experienced was too=
 profound and the coincidence that it happened soon after starting to use h=
is maalaa was too strong, to ignore. I started to
 wonder if he was genuine=
 after all, but his manner of speaking was still too weird for me. I never =
hid my thoughts from him and shared freely.<BR><BR>My journey since then ha=
s been very interesting and I have shared parts of it on this yahoogroup. S=
omeone said Rajarshi's mails reminded of Vimalananda. There is indeed somet=
hing Vimalananda- like about Manish. In fact, Manish says he is like a spir=
itual son to Vimalananda and holds Vimalananda in great esteem. I don't kno=
w Vimalananda, but I know Manish and I can imagine several things mentioned=
 by Vimalananda in "Aghora" series books being correct.<BR><BR>Despite some=
 of his supernatural abilities that I have seen, like the ability to create=
 a specific mystical experience in someone thousands of miles away, he insi=
sts that Devi does everything and he is just a small instrument and an obse=
rver of Devi's leelaa and a small player in the big game of chess being pla=
yed by Devi. In fact, his main teaching to
 me was to improve devotion, fai=
th and surrender and give up doership of my actions.<BR><BR>His teachings a=
re sublime and yet practical. He is not content to explain theory, but prac=
tically demonstrates the weaknesses of mind and how to overcome them. Inste=
ad of swimming in modern pseudo-vedanta, he made me understand and apprecia=
te duality and non-duality at the same time. He made me understand things t=
hrough experience. He brought great change in my attitude and thinking in t=
he last 5.5 years of interaction. He destroyed my biases and expanded the h=
orizons of my understanding and gave a much better perspective.<BR><BR>Most=
 importantly, using me as an instrument, he enabled many sincere spiritual =
seekers to embrace the ancient Vedic sadhana of rishis - homam or fire ritu=
al for saattwik purposes. He tells me that one lakh (one hundred thousand) =
people will be doing homam on a regular basis one hundred years from now.<B=
R><BR>As I said at the beginning of
 this email, inspiring sadhana is more =
important than inspiring awe regarding specific personalities, though the l=
atter sometimes helps with the former.<BR><BR>*    &nbs=
p;  *       *<BR><BR>I will conclude wit=
h Manish's words I mentioned before:<BR><BR>"My message is not that I am sp=
ecial, but it is that everyone is special. My assertion is not that I found=
 god, but it is that everyone can and should find god. I am a normal person=
. If I could find god, anybody could. As people do homam sincerely and unse=
lfishly for a few years, there will be many people who make great progress.=
 World will be a changed place."<BR><BR>"People should do sadhana. Don't wa=
ste time when you are on earth. Never give the excuse that you don't know h=
ow to do sadhana. Do whatever you can. If you know how to do homam, do homa=
