Thanks a lot for this very valuable info and your concern for my welfare. A=
ssuming Apsaras cannot come to us in physical form at all, then how is it t=
hat our Puranas are full of incidents like Rishis marrying Apsaras, Apsaras=
 giving birth to children due to their physical union with Rishis, etc.? Ev=
en some great kings are known to have had the company of Apsaras. For examp=
le, Emperor Pururava was seduced by Urvashi Apsara. She lived with him for =
one year, and then disappeared, leaving him distressed. How all this can be=
 explained? Any insightful ideas from you learned ones pertaining to these =
incidents would be very helpful.<br>

,<br>> Thanks for your kind reply. I believe Apsaras are Devata Sthrees =
or celestial maidens, and if we do Apsara Sadhana, we can make them our com=
panions. All this info is what I have found in certain blogs related to Aps=
ara Sadhana. I really don't know if all this is true, but I'm chanting this=
 mantra with all faith and devotion to Apsaras. If you have any deeper unde=
rstanding of this, plz enlighten me with the same.<br>
