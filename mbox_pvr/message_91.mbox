Dear Bhupendra ji,
 
If one does uni-directional praanaayaam while breathin=
g in through the left nostril, the Ida nadi (lunar channel) becomes activat=
ed. It is exerted more. More activity in the Ida nadi soothes the person wi=
th cool energy (Moon). This kind of praanaayaam when done for a few months =
can make the person pick up weight. It can also increase contentment on the=
 positive side and laziness on the negative.
 
If one does uni-directional =
praanaayaam while breathing in through the right nostril, the Pingala nadi =
(solar channel) becomes activated. It is exerted more. More activity in the=
 Pingala nadi excites the person with warm energy (Sun). This kind of praan=
aayaam when done for a few months can make the person lose weight. It can a=
lso increase activeness on the positive side and irritability on the negati=
ve.
 
The difference between starting with right and left is more prominent=
 in uni-directional praanaayaam than in anulom-vilom. Similar difference is=
 found in anulom-vilom based on left/right, but the degree is smaller.
 
If=
 you are used to starting with left nostril in anulom-vilom like most are, =
continue like that. That is fine.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

  Dear Narasimha Ji,

  Thank you very much for=
 your feedback.m It is the first time though that I have heard about naulom=
-vilom starting from the right nose.  It wouold be possible for you to furt=
her elaborate on yashti and pushti?

  Thank you.

    Namaste Bhupendra ji,

    (0) W=
hen you breathe in, diaphragm (the muscle between lungs and stomach) 
    s=
hould move down so that lungs can expand and move down and push stomach. 
 =
   Then stomach protrudes outward. This gives more volume to lungs and they=
 can 
    take more air. When you breathe out, stomach is contracted inside=
 and 
    diaphragm moves up and lungs contract and move up. This is the co=
rrect 
    breathing.

    Due to the bias in modern lifestyle against a st=
omach that protrudes out, 
    this natural breathing is sub-consciously cu=
rbed by most people. They don't 
    give enough room to their lungs when t=
hey breathe in. Their stomach does not 
    move.

    Some people do it ev=
en worse. As the lungs are sucking in air, their lung 
    muscles get used=
 to sucking everything around them towards them. Thus, their 
    diaphragm=
 is sucked in by the lungs and moves UP when they are breathing in. 
    Wh=
en they are breathing out, all the lung muscles are relaxed and move away 
=
    from lungs. This releases the diaphragm to move DOWN when breathing out=
. 
    This bad breathing style actually reduces the volume of lungs consid=
erably 
    (instead of increasing it considerably) when breathing in. This=
 is the 
    opposite of the correct breathing. This is quite bad. Unfortun=
ately, many 
    people "suffer from" this breathing style these days!

   =
 (1) I am aware of 1:4:2. But 1:1:1 is better for overall health. That is 
=
    what Vasishtha and Vivekananda taught. Make pooraka and rechaka the sam=
e and 
    make kumbhaka as whatever is comfortable.

    (3) Well, it is i=
ndeed tough to get a good rhythm with mantra in 1:4:2. But 
    mantra work=
s quite well with 1:1. In the beginning, you will be focussing on 
    mant=
ra. After some days, it is possible to focus on breath too. Actually, 
    =
I'll say the purpose is served irrespective of whether you are focussing on=
 
    mantra or breath or even an image of god. As long as there is some fo=
cus for 
    the mind, the purpose is served.

    (4) When you breathe in =
forcefully and hold the air, it does feel very nice. 
    But everythingthi=
ng that feels nice is not necessarily good for you!

    (5-6) If you have =
a knee problem, do sit on a chair. Irrespective of how 
    your legs are, =
make sure that you have your back and head erect and eyes 
    closed. That=
 is the key. If you fall asleep, then you will have to find some 
    solut=
ion that stops you from doing it.

    (7) This is not a problem with praan=
aayaama alone. This is a fundamental 
    problem with all sadhana. Each mo=
de of spiritual sadhana (japam, 
    praanaayaamam, homam etc) gives result=
s based on our level of purity and 
    purity comes as you do more sadhana=
. It is a chicken-and-egg came. You just 
    have to get started and hang =
in there without worrying about the speed at 
    which results are coming.=
 Slowly the momentum builds. After crossing a 
    threshold, results start=
 coming very quickly.

    You just do the best you can do at a given point=
 of time and leave the rest 
    to Her.

    If you have time, energy and =
inclination, you can consider homam. Out of all 
    the practices I know, =
homam is the fastest in burning karmas and purifying 
    one's core. That =
is the power of living fire. If you do a daily homam of 
    30-45 min for =
6 months, your dhyana and dharana will improve a lot.

    * * *

    A cou=
ple of additional points:

    (9) There is something known as the "nasal c=
ycle". The breathing is not 
    equal in the two nostrils at all times. Th=
e left nostril is more free and 
    the right nostril is less free for 2 h=
ours. Then the right nostril is more 
    free and the left nostril is less=
 free for another 2 hours. And so on. This 
    pattern was taught by Yogis=
 and now science also found it and calls it the 
    nasal cycle. The 2 hou=
r period mentioned by me is ideal. In most people, it 
    is different. Fo=
r example, someone may have a more active right nostril for 
    2.5 hours =
and a more active left nostril for 1.5 hours.

    Keep one nostril closed =
and breathe in and breathe out through the other 
    nostril. Now swich th=
e try the other nostril. See which one feels more free. 
    You can also s=
tand in front of a mirror and breathe in out through both 
    nostrils and=
 see in the mirron which nostril is opening more.

    If you track your cy=
cle, the time when the active nostril is about to change 
    is a good tim=
e to do praanaayaama. At the transition time, both nostrils are 
    more o=
r less equally open! That is conducive to a more fruitful 
    praanaayaama=
.

    In general, the right and left nostrils are associated with the Ping=
ala 
    (Surya) and Ida (Chandra) nadis of the subtle body. In modern scie=
ntific 
    terminology, they are associated with the sympathetic and paras=
ympathetic 
    nervous systems. One nervous system is "push" based and the=
 other is "pull" 
    based. One excites and the other restrains. As a resu=
lt, there is balance.

    There are certain activities that are best perfo=
rmed when the right nostril 
    is more active and certain activities that=
 are best performed when the left 
    nostril is more active. It is also p=
ossible to force a change in the active 
    nostril through action. If you=
 lie down on the floor on your left side, then 
    the right nostril will =
open up in 5-10 minutes. Or, if you chant Savitru 
    Gayatri mantra for a=
 while perfectly, the right nostril will open up.

    (10) Just as there i=
s a kumbhaka between pooraka and rechaka, it is possible 
    to have a sho=
onyaka (name coined by me) between rechaka and pooraka. It is 
    possible=
 to empty the lungs (rechaka) and hold like that for a while 
    (shoonyak=
a) before breathing in again (pooraka). Though Vasishtha does not 
    ment=
ion the name shoonyaka, he does talk in Yoga Vaasishtham about holding 
   =
 breath after rechaka and seeing gods and celestials.

    However, this is=
 a really dicey thing and I should have perhaps not even 
    mentioned. On=
e needs to be guided by a sadguru and have his blessings.

    (11) When yo=
u do anulom-vilom, do you breath in through right nostril first 
    or lef=
t? Both are possible. If you start breathing from the left, it causes 
    =
"Pushti" (nourishment). If you start breathing from right, it causes 
    "=
Yashti" (sacrifice, i.e. burning). The Ida nadi (Moon - left) causes 
    p=
ushti, while Pingala nadi (Sun - right) causes yashti. Depending on what 
 =
   you want, you can adopt one way.

    Instead of anulom-vilom, it is act=
ually possible to always breathe in from 
    left and breathe out through =
right (to gain weight, i.e. pushti) or to 
    breathe in from right and br=
eathe out through left (to lose weight, i.e. 
    yashti). In this approach=
, all poorakas are from ONE nostril (left or right) 
    and all rechakas a=
re through the other nostril (right or left). This is good 
    for the spe=
cific purpose of activating one nadi.

    Even in anulom-vilom, different =
teachers teach differently. You decide it 
    based on your goal. I have g=
iven the basis above.

    Narasimha

r a while perfectly, the right nostril will open 
    up.<BR><BR>(10) Just =
as there is a kumbhaka between pooraka and rechaka, it 
    is possible <BR=
>to have a shoonyaka (name coined by me) between rechaka and 
    pooraka. =
It is <BR>possible to empty the lungs (rechaka) and hold like that 
    for=
 a while <BR>(shoonyaka) before breathing in again (pooraka). Though 
    V=
asishtha does not <BR>mention the name shoonyaka, he does talk in Yoga 
   =
 Vaasishtham about holding <BR>breath after rechaka and seeing gods and 
  =
  celestials.<BR><BR>However, this is a really dicey thing and I should hav=
e 
    perhaps not even <BR>mentioned. One needs to be guided by a sadguru =
and have 
    his blessings.<BR><BR>(11) When you do anulom-vilom, do you b=
reath in 
    through right nostril first <BR>or left? Both are possible. I=
f you start 
    breathing from the left, it causes <BR>"Pushti" (nourishme=
nt)<WBR>. If you 
    start breathing from right, it causes <BR>"Yashti" (s=
acrifice, i.e. 
    burning). The Ida nadi (Moon - left) causes <BR>pushti,=
 while Pingala nadi 
    (Sun - right) causes yashti. Depending on what <BR=
>you want, you can adopt 
    one way.<BR><BR>Instead of anulom-vilom, it i=
s actually possible to always 
    breathe in from <BR>left and breathe out=
 through right (to gain weight, i.e. 
    pushti) or to <BR>breathe in from=
 right and breathe out through left (to 
    lose weight, i.e. <BR>yashti).=
 In this approach, all poorakas are from ONE 
    nostril (left or right) <=
BR>and all rechakas are through the other nostril 
    (right or left). Thi=
s is good <BR>for the specific purpose of activating one 
    nadi.<BR><BR>=
Even in anulom-vilom, different teachers teach differently. You 
    decide=
 it <BR>based on your goal. I have given the basis above.<BR><BR>Best
