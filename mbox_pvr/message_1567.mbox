Namaste,
 
As mentioned below, Vasanta Navaratris (9 days from tomorrow) ar=
e a great time for Chandipath, just like Sarannava raatris that come six mo=
nths later.
 
In addition, this is a great time to pray to Lord Rama. You c=
an take any mantra of Rama and keep chanting it as many times as you can ev=
eryday. Some people read Valmiki's Ramayana or Tulsidas's Ram Charit Manas.=
 If you know no mantra of Rama, his amrita mantra ("Sree Raama Raama Raama"=
) can be tried. It is a powerful mantra. His dwadasakshari is "Om namo bhag=
avate Raamachandraaya". Actually, just repeating "Sree Raama" or even just =
"Raama" is powerful.
 
The key is to do it with as much focus of mind as po=
ssible, keep the body steady and free from motion (as much as possible), ke=
ep the eyes closed, do the chanting mentally, keep the back and neck straig=
ht and maintain brahmacharya if possible.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
