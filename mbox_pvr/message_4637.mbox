Namaste,
 
I may read a nice math book and declare: "one who reads this book will score atleast 90% in tenth grade math exam". However, some people may read the book but not digest it well enough to get 90%. They may only get 20%.
 
When you buy any processed food item in USA, they give the nutrition information. If they declare that something has 20 gm of protein, it does not mean everybody who eats it will get 20 gm of protein. Some may be unable to digest and absorb all the protein and may get only 2 gm of protein from it.
 
The above statements are not lies. But they only indicate the potential of something. Same holds with phalasrutis of prayers. They indicate the potential of the prayer and the specific results may vary.

Even half or quarter a verse can be powerful in some cases. If one focuses mind completely, if I-ness disappears completely and if one's mind reverberates with a sound pattern, it can purify one and remove a lot of conditioning.

Phalasrutis have a wonderful effect on people, from the point of view of inspiration and motivation.
 
When I was 23, I was inspired by the phalasruti of Lakshmi's ashtottara shata naama stotra (108 name prayer). It says "bhR^iguvaare shataM dhImaan paThed vatsaramaatrakam. aShTaishvaryamavaapnoti kubera iva bhUtale.." It means, "one who reads this 100 times on Fridays for one year will beget 8 kinds of wealth like a Kubera on earth."
 
At that time, I was an egoistic scholar full of intellectual brilliance and a good knowledge of Sanskrit and scriptures, but no real spiritual understanding or a sense of what is permanent and what is transient. However, one good quality I had (which I still have I think) was that I had a steely determination and persistence. I was attracted by the phalasruti. Oneday in 1994 January, I suddenly decided that I would read Lakshmi's 108 name prayer 108 times every Friday for one year. I just took the sankalpa and started doing it. Of course, my goal was to become wealthy "like Kubera".
 
One Friday in the 10th month, I happened to be at the Lakshmi temple in Thiruchanur (near Thirumala Venkateswara/Balaji temple). I sat down in a corner and did my japam there. It felt really really nice. I got an instinct then, "this nice feeling is what I need and not millions." I prayed to her, "Mother, I was foolish to seek wealth from you. I do not need material wealth. I will take whatever you give and try to use it well. But please bless me to be happy and peaceful like this always. THAT is what I really want." I then decided that I will not stop this vrata after one year and will continue this for my entire life. I have been doing this particular japam every Friday since then. By Her grace, no breaks ever came, though I was tested a few times.
 
One example: I went to Korea in Nov 1994. 1994 Dec 31 was a Friday. We used to work till 9 pm in Korea. I would normally go home at 9:30 pm and do my japam then. That being the New Year eve, we were forcibly taken to a new year party by Korean boss who thought he was being nice to us. I kept asking them to let me go. Finally, I said it was enough and went off by myself after midnight. By the time I figured out how to go home by myself - I was a stranger in a country where most did not speak English - it was past 3:00 am. I was sleepy and wanted to slee, but I resisted the temptation. I took bath, sat down and finished reading the 108 name prayer 108 times. In Vedic reckoning, weekday changes at sunrise and not at midnight, by the way.
 
There was an occasion when I had a fever of 104 deg and could not even sit. I just lied down on the floor in the pooja room and read the prayer 108 times. With Her grace, there were a few tests like that, but there was no break in this practice for 16+ years.
 
Interestingly, my daughter was born exactly after 108 Fridays of this vrata. Manish contacted me for the first time after I finished 5x108 Fridays of this vrata. My first occult experience that changed my life was on the 11x54th Friday.
 
Overall, I started this vrata for immature material goals. But the sadhana ended up slowly transforming my attitude and making me realize what was transient and what is permanent. Though other sadhanas were started later, like monthly Satya Narayana vrata and daily Chandi homam etc, this Friday vrata has been the bedrock of my spiritual sadhana and one that enabled everything else. If I had not done that sadhana, I would probably be on a different course of life. And to think that I started it with the most immature attitude!
 
That is the thing with phalasrutis. They need to be able to attract even the immature sadhakas!
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

By reading them, one gets a feeling that these statements must be exaggerations since how can one get delievered of all sins by simply reading one-fourth of a shloka? But then, such statements being made by scriptures, cannot be doubted so easily.
