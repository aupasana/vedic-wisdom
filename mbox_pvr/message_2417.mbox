Namaste Ram and other friends,
 
Before I try to address this quandary, I w=
ant to tell a small story.
 
*        *        *
 
More than 120 years ago,=
 Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was a priest at the Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar.=
 Next to the Kaali shrine, there was a Krishna shrine with a beautiful Kris=
hna idol and Ramakrishna used to meditate there sometimes. Due to an accide=
nt when another priest was carrying the idol during a festival, the idol br=
oke oneday.
 
The priests and the highly learned scholars were in a quandar=
y and conferred to decide what to do. The shastras were clear that a broken=
 idol could not be worshipped at a temple and had to be immersed in flowing=
 water. So the learned scholars recommended immersing the idol in Ganges.
 =

Ramakrishna was asked by the temple administration for his view. He though=
t for a while and said calmly, "Suppose you have a son and his leg is broke=
n. Will you try to fix it and keep the son at home and continue to love him=
 or will you throw your son into Ganges?" His simple common sense view prev=
ailed and shastras were set aside! In fact, Ramakrishna himself fixed the b=
roken idol. It was re-installed at the temple and continued to be worshippe=
d.
 
*        *        *
 
The idol was in your house for 56 years. Suddenl=
y, the new found knowledge is creating problems in your mind, after all the=
se years! What good is that knowledge which spoils mental peace by creating=
 doubts, fear and insecurity? One is better off being ignorant than having =
such knowledge.
 
If you have an idol that was worshipped to some extent by=
 your ancestors for 56 years, it would've captured and stored some of the p=
ositive energy and positive thoughts of those people. It would be a great b=
lessing to have at your house.
 
It should not be a problem if you cannot d=
o much ritual worshp to the idol. Just doing simple things should suffice.
=
 
Whenever you see the idol, imagine that there is Ganesha in it for real. =
Love the Ganesa who is in that idol. Bow to him now and then, when you get =
a chance. Show some fruit or raisins or something to the idol now and then,=
 when you get a chance, and imagine that Ganesa tasted them. Every few mont=
hs, clean the idol in water and wipe it (to keep it clean).
 
The key is no=
t how detailed your rituals are and whether you are doing 5 or 16 or 64 or =
more services in your ritual. The key is how strongly you imagine a real de=
ity in that idol and how deeply you love that real deity that you visualize=
 in the idol. Rituals are only meant to facilitate such a visualization and=
 increase such a love. They are neither necessary nor sufficient for establ=
ishing a relationship with a deity (which is, after all, the purpose of kee=
ping an idol)!
 
*        *        *
 
How does a metallic (or stone or wha=
tever) object become divine?
 
Of course, each object and each atom of this=
 universe is filled, in essence, by Aatman or Brahman, i.e. non-dual god. B=
ut, that would apply to the idol as well as a sofa. But you look at an idol=
 as being more divine than the sofa. So we are not talking about the all-pe=
rvading non-dual god here. We are talking about a deity within the field of=
 duality here. That deity is not present in sofa, but present in the idol. =
But, how does the deity get into the idol? Does the idol get that deity in =
it simply because of its shape? Of course not!
 
All lokas and all devatas =
are present within you in a microcosmic form. By the force of your thought,=
 you concentrate a part of the deity who is within you into the idol (or an=
y object). When a priest with a good level of purity and good ability to vi=
sualize (which comes from internal purity and lack of ego) does praana prat=
ishthaa in an idol, his visualization works using the praana pratishthaa ma=
ntra as an instrument and a deity's essence enters the idol.
 
Even if you =
do not do a praana pratishthaa formally, deity's essence will slowly be est=
ablished in the idol if you keep imagining deity in the idol. It is all abo=
ut the power of thought! Thoughts of a pure mind that is not weighed down b=
y a dense and heavy ego and not colored by too many terrible vaasanaas work=
 faster, but even thoughts of an impure mind that is weighed down by a dens=
e and heavy ego and colored by several terrible vaasanaas will also work, a=
lbeit slowly. If you keep imagining a deity with some qualities in an idol =
over a long time, essence of such a deity will invariably be established in=
 the idol over the time! Otherwise, it is just a metallic object.
 
If you =
imagine a deity who is angry with you for not taking good care of him, you =
will slowly create such a form in that idol. Please stop this negativity. I=
magine a beautiful, pleasant, happy and saattwika form with whom you can fa=
ll in love. If a feeling of love overwhelms your mind when you see the idol=
 (instead of thoughts of fear and deity's anger), it will indeed create suc=
h a presence in the idol and do you good.
 
*        *        *
 
There are=
 several *well-meaning* people out there with half-baked understanding that=
 is not based on any direct experience, who go around scaring people in sev=
eral matters relating to god, religion and spirituality. But god is not to =
be feared.
 
Love god. Do not fear god. When your father or mother shout at=
 you or punish you, it is for a good reason and it will eventually be for y=
our good. They are not really angry at you and they actually love you. Simi=
larly, when god punishes you or gives bad results, it is for a good reason =
and it will eventually be for your good. Do not fear god even when god give=
s you bad results. Always *love* god and love god very deeply. More deeply =
than you love your parents, spouse, children etc. That is a simple principl=
e for sureshot spiritual progress.
 
Good luck with your Ganesha idol no ma=
tter what you decide to do with it!
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
