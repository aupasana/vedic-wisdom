Namaste friends,

When we are relaxed, our breathing will be calm & rhythmic. When we are 
tense or agitated, our breathing will be agitated and out of rhythm. 
Breathing is an important indicator of the mental state and it is very 
important to control the breathing. In fact, we say "prANAnAyamya" 
before every ritual. It means "having disciplined the pranas".

*        *        *

Let me give an analogy.

Physical body is like a chariot. Pranas or lifeforces are like the 
horses driving the chariot. Without horses, chariot does not move (like 
corpse). Horses are what makes the chaiot move. Simialarly, it is the 
lifeforce within us that makes us live and do things.

Mind is like the driver controlling the horses. Breathing is like the 
reins held by the driver to control the horses. Intellect is like the 
minister sitting in the chariot and instructing the driver now and then 
on where to go. Soul is like the king sitting back in the chariot and 
enjoying the ride. Whether the ride is good or bad, king is relaxed and 
sits back. He leaves it to the minister and the driver to take care of 
things and does not get involved.

*        *        *

If the driver loses control, horses may run here and there and things 
may get out of control. When the horses are running out of control, 
driver needs to pull the reins and try to gain control over the horses. 
Similarly, when the lifeforce is going out of control, mind needs to 
regain control by controlling the breathing.

There are many different kinds of pranayamas (breathing control 
exercises). The most popular one is "Anulom Vilom Pranayam". Even 
without any special exercise, it is possible to control breathing by 
simply becoming aware of it.

Focus the attention on breathing. Become aware of air coming in, lugs 
getting filled and expanding, lungs pushing diaphragm down, diaphragm 
pushing down and stomach expanding out, then stomach depressing in, 
diaphragm being pushed up, diaphragm pushing lungs us, lungs 
contracting, lungs being emptied and air going out. Become aware of all 
this and do it slowly, rhythmically and calmly. Don't breath too full 
that lungs struggle for space. Breath in slowly and fill lungs slightly 
less than the capacity so that it feels comfortable even when lungs are 
full. Make sure that breathing out also happens slowly and rhythmically. 
If you do this slowly and with attention, for a few minutes, pranas will 
become regular and mind will become calm. This enables one to focus 
better on whatever mind is doing.

After all, if horses are running around out of control, driver will 
struggle to take the chariot where it needs to go. Once the driver gets 
control over horses, it is far easier to take the chariot where it needs 
to go. Similarly, controlling breathing and pranas enhance one the 
ability to do what one is doing, better.

*        *        *

In the modern society, so many people are stressed out and their systems 
are out of order. Consciously controlling the breathing will benefit 
many of them. Even 5-10 minute pranayama daily can make a difference. 
Doing pranayama for 2-3 minutes before any important activity can also 
help a lot.

Best regards,
Narasimha
