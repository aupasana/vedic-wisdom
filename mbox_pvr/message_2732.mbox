Namaste,
 
Out of the 19 or 35 attributes of individualized consciousness, which one gives the idea "I am this" or "I am that"? Of course, it is ahamkaraka or I-ness or egosense or ego principle!
 
Is one's idea of "I am this" limited to a physical body? Of course not! If someone says "so and so person is a terrible person", one may feel offended or if someone says "so and so person is a great person", one may feel elated. One's ahamkara or I-ness is identifying with the criticism or praise, even though nothing is being done to the physical body and only a name is being used. When somebody calls one by name from distance (as opposed to patting on the physical body and calling), one's consciousness may still think "I am being called" and one may turn towards the caller. As in these examples, one's I-ness does of course bind itself to more than a body.
 
Suppose one gets a dream while sleeping. One may have forgotten totally about the physical body in the dream! One may think of something else as "I". In dreams, one may see oneself as a different body or may not even "see" onself, but still one may have the sense that so and so thing is happening to "me". So, even when the mind is drawn away from the physical body, there is still a notion of "I am this" (I-ness) in a dream. That is ahamkara or I-ness or ego principle.
 
Your idea that ahamkara is limited to physical body is absolutely unacceptable. Ahamkara or I-ness extends beyond the physical body.
 
Also, your idea that deities like Agni do not have ahamkara (I-ness) because they do not have physical bodies is incorrect. Of course, Agni does have an I-ness and thinks "I am Agni and this is what I do". If he did not have that I-ness, he would not do everything he does.
 
Moreover, the 19 or 35 ideas of individualized consciousness do interact with each other, whether we use the word "control" for some of those interactions or not. For example, buddhi (intellectual/discriminating mind) judges various past experiences, interacts with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tells it what to do. Then manas interacts with karmendriyas (organs of action) and makes them do various things. My buddhi determined what to write and my manas told my hands to type this and I ended up typing.
 
Your point about "what exists as a part cannot be the whole" is totally out of place. The sense of I-ness, the memories and conditioning, the logical mind, the sensory-motor mind, karmendriyas etc are all different parts of individualized consciousness and they play different roles while interacting with each other in different ways. Some of those interactions may be deemed to be controls.

One does not "read up" these things in a single place. There are different abstractions and breakdowns of what happens in individualized consciousness. There are several sources that speak of different aspects of this knowledge in slightly different terms. One will assimilate this knowledge better if one reads as many sources as possible and contemplates.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

Even after a Soul is freed of the three bodies, the individuality of the Soul Atom is not destroyed (Resurrection implies that), while it has already given up the idea of Ahamkara including all other ideas.
> 
>   Individuality of a causal-bodied being is not due to the idea of Ahamkara because "What exists as a part cannot be the whole". Thus, the idea of Ahamkara, being one of the 35 ideas of the Causal-body, doesn't account for neither controls the rest of the 34 ideas. Each idea is independent of another, without requiring another idea to act upon it - otherwise your buddhi would always interfere with the functioning of Mind or Ahamkara or the 5 functions of life-forces and so on.
> 
>   Essentially, the 35 ideas of causal body are the basic causal forces and are not related as cause-effect to each other. Thus, each is independent of the application of the sense of I-ness derived from Ahamkara. Manas and Buddhi being two of the Causal-ideas, their functioning as well as existence is not "controlled" nor "derived" in any way by the idea of Ahamkara. It is very clear when we see those with sharpest Buddhi or Sharpest Mind still carrying Heaviest Ahamkara, because they didn't work upon that particular idea.

Well, as most Physical-bodied beings cannot see through the Astral/causal cosmoses, it doesn't apply in the same way to the finer Astral and Causal-bodied beings who can always pierce the veil of Maya and see the human activities. Thus, what is "the very basis" of the entire individualized consciousness for a physical-bodied (unenlightened) being is not the same as for an astral/causal bodied being.

>   As an example, Devatas, with their finer bodies, are able to work through all the beings in all their physical-bodies simultaneously (like Ganesh resides in the Mooladhara, Agni digests the food, and so on..), never getting controlled by Ahamkara that would require them to say that this particular body is "my body" or that one is mine - unless they incarnate in Physical bodies themselves. Devatas are, however, Astral/Causal-bodied beings, so they would attempt to influence the Manas (Spirit-Possession) of the sense-bound worshipper. Pretas on the other hand, would attempt to possess ones' physical body as well as act out their Ahamkara.

Chitta being the staging idea for all other modifications, can be termed as the last to go, when the causal body is finally dropped - hence I wrote as rising above Chitta.

However, being constituted of Satwa Guna, it doesn't have any inherent ability to act upon (Rajas) those impressions, just like a container containing an inflammable liquid doesn't automatically burn it down. Sadhana is required for That.
>   The Samskaras stored by Chitta, including those of Nidra, Smriti, Vikalpa, Viparyaya, Pramana, correspond to the Tamo Guna, while the Chitta itself is Satva Guna - hence the "Satvic - Tamas" represents the SuperEther tattwa (refer my previous mail). The all-perceiving Satvic Chitta doesn't get conditioned by the Tamo-guni Samskaras it stores.

Read autobiography of a Yogi (chapter 43) where Sri Yukteswar illustrates that only those beings who cannot be tempted to go back to the pleasing to the eye Astral cosmos are permitted to stay permanently in the Causal cosmos. Pleasing to the eye implies Sense-consciousness which is associated with Manas.

In fact, ego resides in the causal body and affects other bodies. Out of the four antahkaranas, chitta (remembering or conditioned mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are parts of the kaarana sareera (causal body) and remain till the end.

When manas (sensory-motor mind) observes sensory inputs or buddhi (intellectual or thinking mind) analyzes current and past observations of mind or chitta (remembering or conditioned mind) stores various observations or retrieves previously stored observations, they are all guided by the sense of I-ness. That sense of I-ness permeates through all layers of one's individualized consciousness.

One pursuing that path may or may not debate with others and may or may not read many scriptures, but one will analyze and debate within oneself. One starts with the basic axioms (e.g. Self is imperishable and without a beginning or an end). One will go on eliminating things that one is aware of as not being Self. For example, body has a beginning and end and is perishable. So it is not Self. One introspects like this and, though the process of elimination, finally finds the true Self. That is gyaana yoga. Pure gyaana yoga is very difficult to follow in this age.
