Namaste Ashutosh and Rajars=
hi,

There are several technicalities like this, which apply when one does =
a ritual to ensure a specific material result. Some of them are meaningful =
to an extent and some of them are simply made up over the last few millenni=
a by intellectuals.

However, if one is doing a daily or weekly homam for t=
he pleasure of a deity, one can and should ignore these technicalities.

Th=
ere are some traditional brahmanas who have been doing a Ganpathi homam eve=
ryday as a sadhana for many generations and they do not look at these techn=
icalities.

* * *

If Agni (fire god) leaves earth completely and goes to h=
eavens (aakaasha) or netherworld (paataala), there would be no activity on =
earth. You cannot breathe, digest food, think or move your body. Even flow =
of signals in the nerves requires Agni. Agni is present everywhere at all t=
imes. Even during his residence in heavens or netherworld, Agni is certainl=
y capable of acting on earth, receiving our oblations here on earth and mak=
ing them reach various deities.

* * *

If you want to get your father (or =
mother) to buy you a car or to give you money to start a business, you may =
want to pick a good time to see him and talk about it (e.g. when he is not =
tired after quarrel with someone and when he is in a good mood). Of course,=
 even when you think you picked a good time, it may be a bad time and your =
father may not be in a good mood. However, if you do not have any such agen=
das and only want to tell your father "I love you" and take whatever he giv=
es, you can do it anytime. In fact, the latter kind of child will be favore=
d by parents over the long run and will get whatever the parents have to gi=
ve.

Similarly, if you want to get a specific material result, there are se=
veral technicalities to bother about. Even when you bother about them, you =
may not get it right. As I keep emphasizing now and then, there are many co=
rruptions in our understanding of the technicalities and the art of getting=
 specific material results through rituals is nearly extinct. The best appr=
oach is to surrender to your deity, use homam or meditation to express your=
 love and surrender and take whatever you are given in return as a prasad. =
Such a person will be favored by deities over the long run.

* * *

Namaste=
 Ramakishore,

Different points of space and different points of time have =
a different quality to them. Sadhana in Boston is not the same as sadhana i=
n Girnar hills or Arunachala hills. Sadhana on a Chauturthi is not the same=
 as sadhana on Pournima.

If one is doing a specific sadhana occasionally (=
e.g. a monthly Satya Narayana pooja or a monthly Chandi homam or a monthly =
Krishna homam), it is not a bad idea to pick a day/time that is aligned wit=
h the energy of that deity.

However, one can only make so much progress wi=
th occasional sadhana. To make real progress and to experience divinity, mo=
re intense sadhana is needed. If one is into serious sadhana with a mantra/=
deity, one can do it every day and at all times.

* * *

A lot of beggars m=
ay be standing at the gate of a king's palace, waiting for the king to see =
them when leaving/entering the palace and give them some money. That king m=
ay be known to step out of the house to go to a specific place on every so =
and so day and there may be a bigger crowd of beggars gathering at his gate=
 on that day. But, by standing at the gate on that day along with so many b=
eggars, you may or may not be able to get something from the king. On the o=
ther hand, if you simply stand at the gate everyday, king's eyes may fall o=
n you someday!

Have the attitude of a beggar, surrender to the deity, keep=
 doing your chosen sadhana everyday and patiently wait for the deity's grac=
e. That is a sureshot formula for success.

* * *

The issue of auspicious =
days and times is a double edged sword. While a particular day may be more =
auspicious than other days, it may or may not mean much to one. For example=
, if a particular cricket pitch is easier to bat on, you cannot expect to g=
o there and score a century. International cricketers such as Tendulkar, Ga=
mbhir and Sehwag may score more runs there than at other places, but you ma=
y still get out cheaply.

Instead of helping, sadhana done on a particularl=
y good day can sometimes bog one down with false pride and expectancy. I re=
member one incident.

A few years ago, I decided oneday in spring that I wa=
nted to spend the coming Saturday meditating with the Gayatri mantra for th=
e whole day. I got that intention from nowhere and did not look at anything=
 like tithi, my horoscope etc. I simply decided to go ahead. I mentioned it=
 to Manish and he said, "excellent, go ahead". I meditated with Gayatri man=
tra from 5 am till 9:30 pm, getting up only a few times for 2-minute breaks=
 and having a fistful of saattwik food for lunch in the middle of the day. =
When I finished in the night, I was in a nice state.

Next morning, I reali=
zed that the previous day was Akshaya Tritiya (Vaisakha Sukla Tritiya, birt=
hday of Ganga and Parasurama and the day Tretayuga started). It is said tha=
t spiritual sadhana done on Akshaya Tritiya is 1,000 times more effective t=
han a normal day. I was excited that the day I picked at random happened to=
 be an auspicious day.

I mentioned it to Manish. He said, "I knew it was A=
kshaya Tritiya even when you mentioned the intention to me". I asked him wh=
y he did not tell that to me then. He curtly remarked, "knowing you were do=
ing this sadhana on Akshaya Tritiya would not have helped and would have in=
stead distracted you."

He was right. As such, I was a little "proud" of th=
e sadhana - spending the whole day in japam. There was a bit of excitement =
and expectancy that was present as an undercurrent and somewhat distracted =
my focus on the mantra. Had I known that I was doing it on a day when sadha=
na is supposed to be 1,000 times more effective, that undercurrent of usele=
ss excitement would've been higher and distracted me even more!

Bottomline=
: Thumbrules of all kinds exist. But what really matters is the state of yo=
ur mind. Sometimes, doing a sadhana on an auspicious day can create excitem=
ent and expectancy and distract one. Doing the same sadhana everyday and pa=
tiently waiting for it to succeed oneday is perhaps a simpler and more fool=
proof strategy. My 2 cents..

Best regards,
Narasimha

 <BR>> It is just out of curiosity that am asking this question...Does a=
strology matter at all for a serious sadhaka. Can not any day /time or hour=
 be picked for worship. If the relationship with the deity is truly persona=
l why should one even consider the nava grahas in the ritual worship. I inc=
reasingly find that astrology is only serving to discourage the masses rath=
er than pointing them in the direction of worship of divinity. <BR>> <BR=
>> Hope you could throw some light on this.<BR>> <BR>> Regards<BR>=
