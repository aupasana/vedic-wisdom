Namaste,
 
I am cc'ing this reply to vedic-wisdom yahoogroup without reveal=
ing your identity, as the discussion may be relevant/useful to some other p=
eople. Hope you won't mind.
 
*        *        *
 
Background for others:
=
 
This young man is an advaitin and interested in self-knowledge. He is hig=
hly attached to Aadi Shankara. He highly regards those learning and chantin=
g Vedas. He also highly regards those who renounce material world, live sim=
ple lives in simple settings and take up austere lifestyles. He has a negat=
ive opinion on tantra and, to some extent, on rituals that are not "Vedic" =
in his view.
 
He mentioned to me once that knowledge taught by someone not=
 following "austerities" is useless. He thought that austerities are vital =
to getting self-knowledge. His idea of austerity is living a simple life in=
 simple settings with maximum isolation from the material world.
 
I argued=
: "usually austerities are performed by those getting self-knowledge, but a=
usterities are neither necessary nor sufficient to get self-knowledge. A se=
lf-realized person may be living a seemingly opulent or even debased lifest=
yle, but his mind may be detached. For example, Girish was highly regarded =
by Ramakrishna and Vivekananda, but he associated with drunkards and prosti=
tutes and ended up transforming many people who had no hope otherwise. Jana=
ka lived as a king in the middle of opulence, but was as detached as any ri=
shi. Thus, what kind of austerities one seems to follow externally may or m=
ay not have a bearing on one's knowledge and level of spiritual evolution. =
Whether and what austerities one follows externally is not the main factor,=
 but one's mental state is what matters. How attached one is to one's actio=
ns and their fruits decides how free one is and that decides how complete o=
ne's knowledge is. If one has a rina with some drunkards and nature takes o=
ne to a club to give something to a few drunkards, a liberated man may even=
 go to a club and interact with them. The issue is not *what* one does, but=
 with what mental attitude one does it and how much attachment one has to t=
he results. I am not saying that you should do such things, but realize tha=
t some realized people may do it. Do not dismiss people based on external f=
actors. Follow your path, but have respect for all paths."
 
He was taken a=
back and protested that I have been too influenced by "tantra". He sent a f=
ew quotes from Srimad Bhagavad Gita to support his view on austerities (see=
 below). I will now reply to his mail quoted below.
 
*        *        *
 =

Sri Krishna said in 18.4 quoted below that sacrifice, giving and austerity=
 are not to be given up ever. They never become an obstacle to self-realiza=
tion. Though some philosophers said all actions should be rejected as they =
bind one, Krishna made it very clear that some actions should never be give=
n up and they do not bind one when performing without an attachment to the =
fruits of the actions.
 
Anyone who is not yet liberated obviously has seve=
ral pending kaarmik debts. Until they are paid off, Nature will not let tha=
t person become free. So one needs to somehow pay those debts back, without=
 incurring newer debts. Thus, the idea of some philosophers that you need t=
o give up all action is illogical. If you give up all action, you can never=
 pay off pending debts. No wonder Krishna says some actions should never be=
 given up. Even Vasishtha teaches at the beginning of Yoga Vaasishtham that=
 action and knowledge are the two wings with which the bird of soul flies o=
ff and becomes liberated.
 
But your idea of acceptable actions seems to be=
 to sit in a small hut in a secluded place and do external austerities. Tha=
t can help one control the mind and not incur new kaarmik debts, but how do=
es it help one pay off previous kaarmik debts? Through austerity, one can p=
ay off some kinds of karmik debts, but some firm karmaik debts require one =
to interact with others. So, interacting with others and giving things back=
 to others are needed to pay off all debts and become free.
 
After all, Sr=
i Krishna included sacrifice and giving, in addition to austerities, when l=
isting the actions that must never be given up! One should sacrifice one's =
interests and give to others. One should do that without worrying about the=
 end result of the action.
 
*        *        *
 
Now, the question is who=
 to give and what to give. What is the "obligatory action" referred below?
=
 
That can change from one person to another. Swadharma, or the right thing=
 to do for an individual, is decided for each individual based on previous =
mental conditioning and previous kaarmik debts. One of the goals of sadhana=
 is find one's swadharma and discharge it. One will never fully and clearly=
 know one's correct dharma. As one discharges some of one's responsibilitie=
s, as one's ego becomes less, as one's attachment to the fruits of one's ac=
tions becomes less, one becomes purer. As one becomes purer, one's understa=
nding of swadharma becomes clearer.
 
One person's dharma may be kill his g=
urus, brothers etc (Arjuna). One person's dharma may be to live in a palace=
 and rule a big kingdom (Janaka). One person's dharma may be to spend time =
with drunkards and prostitutes and slowly teach them about god in a way the=
y can understand (Girish). One person's dharma may be to roam the whole cou=
ntry or the world, debate with others and establish knowledge of Adwaita (A=
adi Shankara and Vivekananda). There is no absolute right or wrong. What is=
 right action for one person may be wrong action for another. For example, =
Swami Chandrasekhara Saraswati, an undoubtedly liberated soul, considered c=
rossing ocean a sin based on tradition and refused to leave India's shores.=
 But people like Swami Vivekananda and Srila Prabhupada crossed oceans to t=
each sublime knowledge in foreign lands. What each one did was right for hi=
m.
 
*        *        *
 
Given that one's own dharma may be *anything*, i=
t is important to not close one's mind to some actions. If one controls the=
 mind's pre-occupation with self-gratification, controls ego, if one develo=
ps the ability to do what one can do for others without expecting anything =
in return, then Nature will slowly take one towards more and more aspects o=
f one's own dharma.
 
One who has strong preconceived notions of right and =
wrong and closing the mind to some things may end up running away from one'=
s own dharma due to the aversion to some actions!
 
Sri Krishna clarified i=
n verse 18.10 below that one should not dislike a disagreeable work or be a=
ttached to an agreeable work. If one is fascinated by living in a secluded =
place or doing specific external austerities (what you call "the saatvic au=
sterities") and if one finds certain things disagreeable (e.g. going to a c=
lub, interacting with practitioners of a specific path, living in opulent c=
onditions) and ends up avoiding disagreeable work and picking agreeable wor=
k, one is violating what Krishna said in 18.10.
 
If one says "I will sacri=
fice, but only X and Y; I will give, but only X and Y and only to A and B; =
I will do austerities, but only X and Ys", that is reflective of one's mis-=
conceptions and effectively one has an attachment to the results of actions=
 and perhaps to the actions themselves. That is not saattwik renunciation.
=
 
Sattwik renunciation as taught by Sri Krishna below is one where one feel=
s comfortable engaging in any acts of sacrifice, giving and self-restraint,=
 without any attachment to the results.
 
All interaction with other object=
s of the field of duality involves give and take. Actions where one is obli=
vious to what one receives and focuses only on giving to others, will free =
one from kaarmik debts without incurring new debts. If one lives in a palac=
e and mentally enjoys the comforts there, one is "receiving" something from=
 the external world. That will make one incur new kaarmik debts. On the oth=
er hand, if one lives in a palace, lives in great comforts and yet manages =
to keep the mind disengaged and oblivious to the comforts, then one is not =
getting anything from the external world. The idea is to stop receiving thi=
ngs from others and yet keep giving things to others. Eventually all the de=
bts will be finished off.
 
Giving up specific things because one thinks th=
ey are bad is not saattwik renunciation. Giving up attachment to the result=
s even as one engages in actions and giving up likes and dislikes at the me=
ntal level is saattwik renunciation. Sacrificing self-interests and giving =
things to others, while restraining the mind from its preoccupation with se=
lf-gratificatiton and without any attachment to the result is saattwik renu=
nciation. Giving whatever one is in a position to give and someone else is =
in a position to receive, with total oblivion to what one receives in retur=
n, is saattwik renunciation. Notions like "I need to avoid this action beca=
use it is disagreeable" and "I should somehow do this action because this i=
s agreeable" are blockages.
 
If one avoids such notions, gives more and mo=
re to others, becomes more and more oblivious to what one receives in retur=
n and one's ego becomes less and less, then one will become clearer and cle=
arer regarding what one needs to do and slowly marches on the path to self-=
knowledge.
 
*        *        *
 
Read the story of Choodala and Sikhidhwa=
ja in Yoga Vaasishtham, which was taught by Maharshi Vasishtha to Lord Rama=
 to impart self-knowledge to Lord Rama. King Sikhidhwaja leaves his kingdom=
, goes to a forest, lives in a hut and does austerities for many years and =
yet does not realize Self. His wife Choodala remains in the palace and yet =
becomes realized. She later comes to her husband and helps him in his effor=
t to realize Self. She talks to him about physical austerities vs mental at=
titude and sinternal transformation. I suggest reading and pondering that s=
tory.
 
*        *        *
 
Bottomline: Knowledge of someone following gr=
eat external austerities and yet having a lot of mental conditioning in the=
 form of likes, dislikes, pride, sense of doership, expectations from other=
s etc, may still be incorrect as one is not yet realized. It may be "mere i=
nformation" as you say. On the other hand, knowledge of someone not followi=
ng any external austerities and yet having no ego and no mental conditionin=
g may be perfect.
 
Of course, I have nothing against austerities. They are=
 often helpful. But, realize that the true renunciation is at the mental le=
vel and external austerities do not guarantee it. Combine external austerit=
ies and rituals with constant self-examination and contemplation. There is =
no single path. Follow the path you like, but somehow engineer an internal =
transformation. While you work on that, it is useful to have healthy respec=
t for various paths and various masters, instead of looking down upon some =
people (e.g. those who do not follow "saatvic austerities").

    Dear PVR,
    For the sake of not limit=

XVIII chapter. Verse 5, 6 settles the matter we discussed.  Verse 5 discuss=

 those good actions should be without attachment.There is no where it is en=
couraged, supported or rationalized one to engage in Nishiddha Karma. Howev=
