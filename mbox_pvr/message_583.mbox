Namaste,

(1) No. Any food offered as bali (as opposed to "naivedyam" to a deity) is 
usually not consumed. It is thrown away. If you live in woods, throw it away 
in the open so animals can eat it. Otheriwse, throw it in garbage.

On the other hand, "naivedyam" offered to god can be consumed by people as 
prasad.

(2) Either is fine. They symbolize the path of shakti moving from you to the 
fire and vice versa.

(3) Either is fine.

(4) Whether it is our bodies or flowers/akshatas used in a pooja, everything 
has a purpose and it has to go when its purpose is served. That's the nature 
of life. While the flowers and akshatas are used in homam, they are 
sacrosanct and should be handled with care, love and respect. After they 
serve their purpose, they have to be disposed of however one can. Throwing 
in garbage is fine if you ask me. Another way is to collect them in a bag 
until you accumulate a good amount and burn them oneday. If you have a local 
temple, you can go and see if you can throw them wherever they throw the 
flowers etc they use at the temple.

The ashes from the homam are considered sacred. They contain *some* of the 
energy generated from the homam. The best way to dispose the ashes is to 
throw them into a flowing stream of water (a river or an ocean). This 
ensures that the energy is not localized to one place and is distributed 
back to the Nature. Another thing some people do is to dig a deep pit in the 
yard and bury the ashes. It restricts the energy to the place and not a 
great idea. Please remember that the energy in the ashes is only a *part* of 
the energy generated. Some energy is also within the person performing homam 
and helps to purify the person. Giving some part back to the nature is a 
very good idea.

Best regards,
Narasimha
