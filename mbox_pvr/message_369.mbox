Well, sadhana (effort) is what a being does. Phala (fru=
its) are decided by the Lord. If God wants, a bacteria can get moksha too. =
However, *usually* god has some rules of action and reaction to uphold and =
hence does not act out of order. So the chance of a baterium to get moksha =
is negligible (except at the end of this creation cycle).
 
It is indeed tr=
ue that amoeba or bacteria have very very small chance of moksha in THAT li=
fe. However, nobody stops them from doing some good karma (possibly by *cha=
nce*), get a higher birth and eventually be born as a human and do some sad=
hana.
 
When I wrote "by chance", it may make some uncomfortable. But that =
is the fact. Whatever action we perform with a sense of *I-ness* behind tha=
t action becomes a karma (action) and an equal and opposite phala (fruit/re=
action) will come. Suppose one donates one's eyes and feels good about the =
noble act and the person getting the eyes uses the newly gotten vision to l=
ook at some beautiful women, be tempted and rape them, the donor will get p=
art of that karma! The laws of karma are complex. Thinking like "this is a =
noble karma. So it is good only" is incorrect. Each action results in a ser=
ies of developments and begets some karma for the person. Of course, if an =
act is with committed with ego but not an intention to affect a particular =
development, the part of the karma begotten from that development is smalle=
r (than it would be if that development was intended). Thus, even bacteria =
and amoeba can beget karma from the results of their actions. But it is ver=
y small and accumulates slowly. Highly taamasik beings such as trees, amoeb=
a and bacteria take a looooong time to make progress on the ladder of kaarm=
ik evolution.
 
I want to make three comments:
 
(1) One need not feel sorr=
y for the amoeba and bacteria because they are mostly a long way from moksh=
a. Not all beings need to get moksha right away. If that is needed, god did=
 not need to create this world. If there is unmanifested Brahman and nothin=
g else in this universe, that will solve all problems. But the fact is that=
 manifested Brahman with infinite objects at varying levels of karmic evolu=
tion is not really a problem! That is exactly what is needed for the Lila t=
o unfold.
 
(2) If you want to feel sorry, feel sorry not for amoeba and ba=
cteria, but for those who got the valuable human birth and yet act like amo=
eba and bacteria spiritually. Pity those who are stuck in the cycle of happ=
iness and sadness, elation and depression, hopes and despairs etc, without =
realizing that the play will end soon and what birth one will get next is u=
ncertain!!
 
(3) Actually, more than others, feel sorry for yourself. Who a=
re we to worry about others? They, their god and their gurus will feel sorr=
y for them and do something about them. Apne ko kya lena dena? We are first=
 responsible for ourselves. When one cannot change self and focus attention=
 on god fully within oneself, what is the point in lamenting about the spir=
ituality or lack of it in other people? So, we should all try to look inwar=
d and take a critical look at ourselves, given that we got a very very very=
 valuable life as a human being.

A mind is a mind is a mind. Mind creates the world, not=
 necessarily a human mind. All minds can create a world. However, a human m=
ind is more capable than other minds to break down that created world and r=
eturn to the source. THAT is the point.

I am glad to=
 know that. I am actually a fool who does not know much and cannot help any=
one. But the blessings of my gurus may work through me sometimes and benefi=

Your question is kind of an oxy=
moron. Can good aghoris become "well-known" and come to limelight? :-)
 
I =
know one masterly aghori reasonably well. However, he is not restricted to =
one path. All paths are his own and he does not distinguish. He does aghora=
 sadhanas in smashana and also Vedic sadhanas like Vedic homas with the sam=
e attitude. He chants Vedic mantras too. For example, when he chants Sri Ru=
dram, it produces amazing energy all around. He is a bhakti yogi too. When =
he thinks of Krishna, he melts in devotion. When he discusses upanishads an=
d other Vedanta texts such as Yoga Vaasishtham and BhagavadGita, his keen i=
ntellect shines forth like a Sun and illuminates the thinking of a ready au=
dience. I have never seen anyone who has such a perfect understanding of th=
e essence of Upanishads and exudes it in thoughts, words and actions. He ha=
s wife and children, has a full-time job and engages in several external ac=
tivities and is never idle. But his level of detachment with the work he do=
es so expertly is far higher than even ascetics who renounce everything and=
 *try* to develop some detachment.
 
Bottomline is that he is an aghori, bu=
t he is also a jnaana yogi, bhakti yogi, karma yogi and raaja yogi. He is a=
 vaidika and he is an aghori. All paths are his and he views all the same w=
ay. I don't know if all really good aghoris are like that or just he.
 
In =
any case, it is irrelevant to you if any aghori succeeded or not. If YOU ar=
e meant to succeed in aghota, you will. If not, you will not. To be safe, u=
ntil the right time and right person comes, one should not venture into agh=
ora. I want people to appreciate different things for what they are and not=
 have unhealthy biases, but it does not mean everybody should try everythin=
g. Nuclear engineers hating politicians, politicians hating lawyers and law=
yers hating doctors is bad. But one should become what one is supposed to!
=
 
> A few years back, I had read AGHORA -Kundalini by Robert Svoboda. In 
>=
 that book one Aghori Vimalananda is mentioned. But except in that 
> book,=
 I couldnt find any references to this person anywhere. Not even 
> in net.=
 (The only references were the ones related to Robert 
> Swaboda's book and=
 as his Guru).   
 
Well, he guarded his privacy and made sure that the boo=
ks came out only after he left the body. Moreover, his real name was not th=
at. Also, he led his spiritual life in relative seclusion and not many knew=
 him. No wonder you can't find info on him.
 
Bottomline is: Whether he is =
real or not, one can benefit from teachings attributed to him. The knowledg=
e present in the aghora series of books is nothing short of amazing. It may=
 shock you, but it can change your thinking from inside out and give you a =
clearer understanding. Vimalananda not only managed to impart great underst=
anding to Svoboda, but also ensure that Mother Taaraa Herself would speak t=
hrough Svoboda and the knowledge would come out perfect. Other books author=
ed by Svoboda may not have the same brilliance, but those books came out ju=
st as Vimalananda intended.
 
There are many things in the book which could=
 not have come from a normal person. They came from someone who had a perfe=
ct, steady and unwavering understanding of the absolute truth.
 
BTW, you c=
annot meet a good and genuine aghori unless there is a rina and *he* wants =
you to meet him.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>> Secondly, can you please help me w=
ith a 
question? ..snip..<BR>> He was asking me if yoga, be it jnana yog=
a, bhakti 
yoga <BR>> or any one, is the only way to attain moksha/reali=
sation, then 
what <BR>> will other living organisms like ameoba, bacter=
ia and all will do 
to <BR>> attain moksha? Arent they also living organ=
isms? </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>> ..snip.. He said,=
 if what I am saying is 
correct, only human beings <BR>> will be evolve=
d and other organisms will 
never attain moksha. I was <BR>> breathless =
for a moment and did not know how 
to answer him. I really <BR>> felt sa=
d (and ashamed, because I thought I 
could answer all questions <BR>> re=
lated to the mystery of life) that I 
couldnt answer him. ..snip..</FONT><B=
R><FONT face=3DArial 
size=3D2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial =
size=3D2>Well, sadhana (effort) is what a being does. Phala 
(fruits) are d=
ecided by the Lord. If God wants, a bacteria can get moksha too. 
However, =
*usually* god has some rules of action and reaction to uphold and hence 
do=
es not act out of order. So the chance of a baterium to get moksha is 
negl=
igible (except at the end of this creation cycle).</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><=
FONT face=3DArial size=3D2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=
=3D2>It is indeed true that amoeba or bacteria have very 
very small chance=
 of moksha in THAT life. However, nobody stops them from doing 
some good k=
arma (possibly by *chance*), get a higher birth and eventually be 
born as =
a human and do some sadhana.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>=
 </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>When I wrote "by chanc=
e", it may make some 
uncomfortable. But that is the fact. Whatever action =
we perform with a sense of 
*I-ness* behind that action becomes a karma (ac=
tion) and an equal and opposite 
phala (fruit/reaction) will come. Suppose =
one donates one's eyes and feels good 
about the noble act and the person g=
etting the eyes uses the newly gotten vision 
to look at some beautiful wom=
en, be tempted and rape them, the 
donor will get part of that ka=
rma! The laws of karma are complex. Thinking 
like "this is a noble karma. =
So it is good only" is incorrect. Each action 
results in a series of devel=
opments and begets some karma for the person. Of 
course, if an act is with=
 committed with ego but not an intention to affect a 
particular developmen=
t, the part of the karma begotten from that development is 
smaller (than i=
t would be if that development was intended). Thus, even 
bacteria and=
 amoeba can beget karma from the results of their actions. But it is 
very =
small and accumulates slowly. </FONT><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Highly 
ta=
amasik beings such as trees, amoeba and bacteria take a looooong time to ma=
ke 
progress on the ladder of kaarmik evolution.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT fa=
ce=3DArial size=3D2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>I =
want to make three comments:</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>=
 </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>(1) One need not feel =
sorry for the amoeba and 
bacteria because they are mostly a long way from =
moksha. Not all beings need to 
get moksha right away. If that is needed, g=
od did not need to create this world. 
If there is unmanifested Brahman and=
 nothing else in this universe, that will 
solve all problems. But the fact=
 is that manifested Brahman with infinite 
objects at varying levels of kar=
mic evolution is not really a problem! That is 
exactly what is needed for =
the Lila to unfold.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2> </F=
ONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>(2) If you want to feel sorry, =
feel sorry not for 
amoeba and bacteria, but for those who got the valuable=
 human birth and yet act 
like amoeba and bacteria spiritually. Pity those =
who are stuck in the cycle of 
happiness and sadness, elation and depressio=
n, hopes and despairs etc, without 
realizing that the play will end soon a=
nd what birth one will get next is 
uncertain!!</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT fac=
e=3DArial size=3D2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>(3)=
 Actually, more than others, feel sorry for 
yourself. Who are we to worry =
about others? They, their god and their gurus will 
feel sorry for them and=
 do something about them. Apne ko kya lena dena? We are 
first responsible =
for ourselves. When one cannot change self and focus attention 
on god full=
y within oneself, what is the point in lamenting about the 
spirituality or=
 lack of it in other people? So, we should all try to look inward 
and take=
 a critical look at ourselves, given that we got a very very very 
valuable=
 life as a human being.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2> =
;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>> His question gave me a=
 sleepless night. I 
thought a lot about it. If <BR>> the whole world as=
 a maya exist only in 
human's mind (as per my <BR>> understanding, our =
mind creates this world, 
when through yoga, <BR>> mind/ego collapse hap=
pens, there is no world or 
anything and we <BR>> submerge as oneness in=
 the omnipotent power), if it is 
a creation of <BR>> mind, then there s=

species is <BR>> extinct. Right? =

<DIV><FONT face=

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Your question is kind of an o=

FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT=
 face=3DArial size=3D2>I know one masterly aghori reasonably well. 
However=
, he is not restricted to one path. All paths are his own and he does not 
=
distinguish. He does aghora sadhanas in smashana and also Vedic sadhanas li=
ke 
Vedic homas with the same attitude. He chants Vedic mantras too. For ex=
ample, 
when he chants Sri Rudram, it produces amazing energy all around. H=
e is a bhakti 
yogi too. </FONT><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>When he thinks =
of Krishna, he melts in 
devotion. When he discusses upanishads and other V=
edanta texts such as Yoga 
Vaasishtham and BhagavadGita, his keen intellect=
 shines forth like a Sun and 
illuminates the thinking of a ready audience.=
 I have never seen anyone who has 
such a perfect understanding of the esse=
nce of Upanishads and exudes it in 
thoughts, words and actions. </FON=
T><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>He has wife and 
children, has a full-time jo=
b and engages in several external activities and is 
never idle. But his le=

detachment.</=
FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT=
 face=3DArial size=3D2>Bottomline is that he is an aghori, but he is also 
=
a jnaana yogi, bhakti yogi, karma yogi and raaja yogi. He is a vaidika and =
he is 
an aghori. All paths are his and he views all the same way. I don't =
know if all 
really good aghoris are like that or just he.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial s=
ize=3D2>In any case, it is irrelevant to you if any aghori 
succeeded or no=
t. If YOU are meant to succeed in aghota, you will. If not, you 
will not. =
To be safe, until the right time and right person comes, one should 
not ve=
nture into aghora. I want people to appreciate different things for what 
t=
hey are and not have unhealthy biases, but it does not mean everybody shoul=

Vimalananda not only managed to impart great understanding to Svoboda, =
but also 
ensure that Mother Taaraa Herself would speak through Svoboda and=

Vama Marga successfully and realis=

did any body succeed in=
 the other way? Anybody who was <BR>> well-known as a 
Vamamarga saint?<=
BR>> <BR>> A few years back, I had read AGHORA -Kundalini 
by Robert =
Svoboda. In <BR>> that book one Aghori Vimalananda is mentioned. 
But ex=
cept in that <BR>> book, I couldnt find any references to this person 
a=

to Robert <BR>> Swaboda's book and as his Guru).   <BR>>=
; 
<BR>> Secondly, can you please help me with a question?<BR>> A wee=
k back, 
I was elaborating about realisation and yoga, meditation <BR>> =
and all such 
to one of my cousins who did not actually understand all <BR>=
> what I said. 
He was asking me if yoga, be it jnana yoga, bhakti yoga =
<BR>> or any one, is 
the only way to attain moksha/realisation, then wh=
at <BR>> will other living 
organisms like ameoba, bacteria and all will=
 do to <BR>> attain moksha? Arent 
they also living organisms? (He has d=
one his <BR>> research in Bio 
Informatics, hence his priority to bacter=
ia and <BR>> ameoba). He said, if 
what I am saying is correct, only hum=
an beings <BR>> will be evolved and 
other organisms will never attain m=
oksha. I was <BR>> breathless for a moment 
and did not know how to answ=
er him. I really <BR>> felt sad (and ashamed, 
because I thought I could=
 answer all questions <BR>> related to the mystery 
of life) that I coul=
dnt answer him. His <BR>> question seemed stupid, but 
when I thought of=
 it, isnt that a valid <BR>> question?<BR>> <BR>> His 
question ga=
ve me a sleepless night. I thought a lot about it. If <BR>> the 
whole w=
orld as a maya exist only in human's mind (as per my <BR>> 
understandin=
g, our mind creates this world, when through yoga, <BR>> mind/ego 
colla=
pse happens, there is no world or anything and we <BR>> submerge as 
one=
ness in the omnipotent power), if it is a creation of <BR>> mind, then 
=
there should not be any world when the human species is <BR>> extinct. R=
ight? 
<BR>> <BR>> I dont know if I have convey my doubt clearly.&nbs=
p; <BR>> 
<BR>> Would you be able to share your knowledge on this? <B=
R>> <BR>> (I 
am asking you because, you were instrumental (though un=
knowingly) <BR>> in 
opening the wide horizon of spiritual knowledge to =
me years back <BR>> 
through just one reply to one of my questions relat=
