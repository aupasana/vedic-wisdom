Namaste,
=C2=A0
I will reply to your mail using a metaphor.=

=C2=A0
Suppose one is about to sink in the ocean and gets hold of a boat w=
ith just one hand. Suppose he just clings on to the boat with one hand as t=
he fierce waves of the ocean keep pushing him in all directions.
=C2=A0
Sup=
pose a learned man comes and says "this is not the way to ride a boat. My s=
on, climb the boat, sit down calmly inside the boat and ride out the stormy=
 waters of the ocean". Of course, the learned man is correct. That would de=
finitely be a better way to ride the boat!
=C2=A0
But, if the waves keep pu=
shing the hapless man and he is unable to hold the boat with both hands and=
 climb it, he should ensure that he is *atleast* hanging on to it with one =
hand. That will atleast stop him from sinking in the ocean! When the waves =
become less fierce and one gets an opportunity, one may be able to climb in=
side the boat.
=C2=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

SARVAM GYANANANDAMAYAM
AUM GURUBYO NAMAH

Dear S=
hri Narasimha,

Namaste.=C2=A0 May i write a few lines?

Most of the times =
the following enlisted activities viz., walking or talking or 
driving or t=
yping or reading or writing or answering nature's calls, take place in a se=
mi-conscious state/mechanically.

Utterance of the Nama/name of the Lord sh=
ould take place in a fully conscious state.=C2=A0 In other words highest va=
lue should be given to the utterance of the 'nama' as both the 'nama' and t=
he lord are one and the same/inseparable. The person is not indeed aware ab=
out the other activities enlisted above when he is in the 'nama-yamuna' !!/=
nama-vrindava na!!/nama- sagara!!.

The goal therefore should be to transce=
nd from the state of mechanicalness to that of consciousness.

HARE KRSNA H=
ARE KRSNA KRSNA KRSNA HARE HARE
HARE RAMA HARE RAMA RAMA RAMA HARE HARE

Be=
st wishes.

May Mother Bless.

Astrologically & spiritually yours,
p.s.rama=
narayanan.

Namaste Sir,

Do I know you from before?

=
If you do not mind, can I have your birthdata (date, time and place of 
bir=
th)? You can send it privately to pvr@charter. net.

If your goal is reachi=
ng Vaikuntha loka and serving the Lord, just chant His 
name all the time w=
hen you are awake. Whether you are walking or talking or 
driving or typing=
 or reading or writing or answering nature's calls, you can 
still silently=
 chant His name in the mind.

If you do this enough, your mind will start c=
hanting his name when it is 
asleep too!

Your goal should be to repeat a (=
any) name of the Lord all the time, so that 
taking that name becomes the s=
econd nature to your mind!

Other things are not as useful as getting addic=
ted to a name of the Lord.

Best regards,
Narasimha
