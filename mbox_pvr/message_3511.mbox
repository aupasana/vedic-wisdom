Namaste,

What he wrote was to do Savitri Gayatri mantra 1000 times everyda=
y in one sitting and do like that for 100 days at a stretch without break. =
Then possibly give a break for a few days and do for another 100 days. Like=
 that, do for 3 stretches of 100 days each.

Of course, if needs no break, =
one can do 300 days in a row too. But, keeping brahmacharya (abstinence) ma=
y be difficult for some people and hence the suggestion of the break.

For =
success in any sadhana, brahmacharya is very important. Restraint from sex =
and control of anger and short-temper will help one avoid leakage of shakti=
 (purifying energy). Everytime one experiences lust, anger etc, one loses s=
ome shakti.

Every factor contributes a little to success. Beard is useful.=
 The tradition of growing beard exists in many religions and it is not with=
out a reason. We discussed this sometime back.

If one is living a lifestyl=
e where one avoids contact with any tempting situations altogether (e.g. li=
ving in a remote monastery), beard may or may not add much value. But, if o=
ne is living a lifestyle where one comes in contact with tempting situation=
s regularly (e.g. living in the modern world with a family and job and a TV=
), beard can be very useful. As I said earlier when we discussed this, bear=
d is not the complete solution but a small part of the solution. Just as a =
railing on the side of a hill road may stop a slowly moving car from slidin=
g off the hill at night but be unable to stop a fast moving car out of cont=
rol, similarly a beard can help a person with decent control over the mind =
to retain control in some tricky situations.

Trimming beard is ok.

=A0=C2=A0 *

If one indeed does 1000 times Gayatri (or any mantra for a cou=
ple of hours) everyday for one year while maintaining brahmacharya, 
while =
following the simple rules of same place, same time everyday and facing the=
 same direction, one will certainly make good progress. Brahmacharya is one=
 key thing and sitting still with an erect back, neck and head with the eye=
s closed is the other thing. The probability of mind becoming still is almo=
st zero if the body is not still. If the body can be kept very still, there=
 is a chance that mind will also become still for a moment. If the mind is =
still for even a moment, it will cause great bliss. As mind gets more used =
to being still, it will become still more often and for longer times. Then =
various kinds of samadhis become possible.

Best regards,
Narasimha

      This is a great mail and very insp=
iring. However, I have one question on Sri Manishji's advise on how to carr=
y out the sadhana. He says do it for 100 days and repeat the whole procedur=
e for 3 times. So, should we do 3000 times japam in a day for 100 days or d=
o 1000 times every day for=C2=A0300 days? He also says 'Grow a beard'. Now,=
 in a professional corporate life, that could be a difficult thing. How abo=
ut trimming it?.... just to be tolerable to other people. Maybe my question=
 is silly but it is genuine.
