Namaste,
 
Yes, one can imagine homa karma mentally on a day when the actua=
l homam is not performed. If one can imagine an action in the mind with the=
 same level of intense self-identification with the action as when it is do=
ne externally, it gives the same effect then. But that is difficult for mos=
t people. Self-identification is far less intense when an action is imagine=
d in the mind. So external practices help first.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
