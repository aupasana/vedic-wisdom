Ok..

Vimalananda may have overcome lust after having his deity with him. Someone 
else may have to first overcome his lust even to have a vision of the deity. 
What is good for goose is not good for gander. In general, it is good to try 
to overcome lust if it is possible.

Several "normal college going people" were taken under his wings by 
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and transformed into spiritual giants. Swami 
Vivekananda, Swami Brahmananda, Swami Yogananda etc were college students 
when they met Ramakrishna.

But it is not easy to overcome lust at all. Several of Ramakrishna's 
disciples also struggled with it initially and overcame lust with his 
blessings. Lust is a very basic human instinct and not at all easy to kill 
completely.

In the beginning, it is ok if the thought does not go out of the mind. Set a 
rule for 20 days or 40 days or 108 days or some period like that and 
maintain physical brahmacharya. Don't worry if thoughts come.

Feeling of guilt is a weight and it does not help in overcoming the basic 
problem. Don't be over-burdened by it.

True, suppressing desire will make the desire come back later. But, if one 
keeps fulfilling desires, they never end!!  This is the nature of desire. 
Whether one desires money or knowledge (of anything other than Self) or 
physical pleasures, the desire will never end no matter how much one gets.

Removing desire from the root often requires suppressing the desire 
temporarily. But the thing to remember from the Aghora book is that just 
suppressing desire is not sufficient. Practice suppressing desires, but do 
remember that the final goal is to uproot it fully and keep working on it.

That is the right spirit!

Spiritual progress involves a lot of things and brahmacharya is one thing. 
The most fundamental thing is to overcome ego and not become attached to 
things. Developing detachment to one's actions and possessions and 
developing a sense of surrender is the most fundamental thing.

There are several things in spiritual progress. They all come together! One 
person may develop detachment to actions and possessions and brahmacharya 
may become easy as a result. One person may achieve brahmacharya first and 
detachment may become easy as a result and come later. Various signs of 
spiritual progress come almost together, but the exact order can change from 
person to person. Thus, do not be disappointed by your inability to get 
something. It may be possible to work it out from another angle!

Best regards,
Narasimha

Namaste sir

i know you are lot busy but since i couldn;t ask this question on a
public forum as it may probably offend others.
If you have time ,if you could please reply.

I was thinking this for many days
that as mentioned in recent thread on brahamcharya,
it was important to maintain brahamcharya but i wanted to ask that
even vimalananda had to work for 6 years for overcoming lust though
he had his deity with him from the very early in life.

how can normal college going people like me who don't even have a
deity obtain this goal.
Though i try to maintain physical brahamcharya for few months but
after that i am not able to hold it ,
and even if i maintain some physical chastity it refuses to go out
of mind

Moreover, what i read in AGHORA was the important thing is not
suppress desires but remove them from the root

So, how can i finish it completely from my mind
Though i have read Swami Sivananda's book on Practice of Brahamcharya
but i don't think i have made any spiritual progress in maintaing
Brahamcharya

and sometimes it makes me guilt ridden.

The only reason for which i keep trying for brahamcharya is if
vimalananda took such a long time probasbly i can also do it , if
not in 6 years at least in 10-12 years

you can also reply on VEDIC WISDOM group but if you can remove my
identity from this that would be appreciable

if what i worte offended you please delete this mail

regards
