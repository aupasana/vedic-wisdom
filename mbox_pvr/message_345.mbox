Namaste,
 
I will suggest just before sunrise, around 6 am. Vargottama Sun =
in lagna and Jupiter in 5th is good. Ketu will be in 12th. Guru hora will b=
e running. Go for it.
 
The best source for homa kundam is on indousplaza.c=
om. Go to "religious and pooja" and "copper articles". "Copper Hawan Kund #=
1" is perfect for a homam at home and many people I know are using it in US=
 in their homes and apartments successfully. Direct link is below. These gu=
ys are very fast with shipping and ship from NJ/NY.
 
http://www.indousplaz=
a.com/copper-hawan-kund-p-4818.html?cat=3D8&cPath=3D8_188&osCsid=3D2c0a3523=
d584bb82048157574b8e315f
 
In fact, I keep a stock of this and gift to peop=
le who are interested. If you live near Boston and can come to my house in =
Grafton, I can actually gift one to you. I can also drop it off somewhere o=
n my way to work (in Andover).
 
Slowly more and more people are doing a da=
ily or weekly homam from around the world. When this reaches a critical mas=
s, it will be good for the world and for sanatana dharma. However, we are n=
ot in a hurry and not forcing anyone. But the mails I get now and then from=
 people who started recently are really touching and inspiring. One person =
wrote that he has a spiritual master and went to him for advice, showed the=
 manual and asked whether or not he should do it. Look at his faith in his =
master! The master read it and said "go ahead and do it. Actually, you know=
 what, I will also do it. Give me the manual" and both started doing it.
 
=
Best regards,
Narasimha
