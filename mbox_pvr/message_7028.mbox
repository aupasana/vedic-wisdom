Namaste Narasimha,

<<You assumed that Paramahamsa, Siddha, Natha (Mahasidd=

categories and exponentially "greater" than each o=

=C2=A0
I assume because Vimalananda mentions that they are greater =
to each other. And 
it sounds quite logical to me. The exponential as I tol=
d you, was an 
approximation and nothing more, since you kept pestering for=
 a 'formula'. BTW, 
Vimalananda even goes to extent of mentioning a Nath ma=
y takes thousands of 
years of sadhana to pulled into a Muni and similarly =
a Muni may take "billions" 
of years of sadhana to become a Rishi, IF, a hi=
gher being decides to pull them 
forward. Else they can keep staying in the=
ir ever 'orbits' around the center, 
very close, yet not merging.
=C2=A0
<<=

Added to this the fact that Vivekananda was very clear, just as all the 
d=
isciples of Ramakrshna were clear, that Ramakrishna was a special spiritual=
 
being, and higher than them. Here too I see no confusion.
=C2=A0
<<It is =
not necessary that there is a clear order of greatness. Infinity is 
neithe=
r greater than nor less than nor equal to infinity.>.
=C2=A0
This is what I=
 call approximation. For an ordinary=C2=A0man, all saints maybe 
equally=C2=
=A0elevated. For=C2=A0Yogis, there maybe subtle differences and depths. The=
 
truth lies in the nuances.=C2=A0Anyway, Vivekananda's own words are more =
reliable for 
me than yours on this matter. And my previous explanation act=
ually clarifies 
this statement of Sri Ramakrishna that Vivekananda was the=
 "ancient Rishis Nara" 
who came down for the good of mankind.
=C2=A0
<<Wis=
e men tread cautiously and do not rush to judgment on others.>>
=C2=A0
I am=
 merely quoting and putting together the analysis, statements of spirituall=
y 
great people. It is not as complex as you think! Saying that A is fatter=
 than B, 
based one statements and quotes from people who maybe in the know=
 of things, is 
hardly a judgement. It could very well be a fact.

Namaste Rajarshi,
=C2=A0
You assume=
d that Paramahamsa, Siddha, Natha (Mahasiddha) and Rishi are fixed 
categor=
ies and exponentially "greater" than each other. You assumed that 
Ramakris=
hna is a Paramahamsa on that scale, because he is famously known so. 
Then =
you concluded that Vivekananda is lower than a "Paramahamsa", because he is=
 
lower than Ramakrishna. You assumed that Vimalananda is a rishi because s=
omeone 
you respect "says so". So you concluded Vivekananda is 2 and Vimala=
nanda is 
2pwr16.
=C2=A0
Now, Ramakrishna himself said that Vivekananda and=
 six other sishyas were 
"Ishwara Koti" or "Nitya Siddhas". Can you tell me=
 where this falls on 
Vimalananda's scale? What do you think "Nithya Siddha=
" (nithya=3Deternal) means? 
Is it Siddha or Mahasiddha or even greater or =
in between? If six disciples were 
"Nithya Siddhas" and Ramakrishna is "gre=

"Paramahamsa" on this scale, i.e. lower than=
 them?

Dear Narasimha, 
=C2=A0 
In the =
discussion that happened, here is my stand, in case you have not 
understoo=
d the same properly: 

=C2=A0 
1) He was something special - which I cannot=
 judge - because Manish says so, and 
on THIS point I trust Manish's judgem=
ent more than your or mine. 

=C2=A0 
2) Some siddhis as you noted are spec=
ial. Only very higher level beings can 
attain the same. Since the topic of=
 siddhis did come up, Vimalananda's ability 
to suck up a ton of mercury by=
 Vajroli and bring it out from his hair infront of 
someone of Vishudhanand=
a's spiritual calibre, is not a easy feat. This is not a 
run-of-the-mill s=
iddhi. 

=C2=A0 
3) I never compared Vimalananda with Ramakrishna, but with=
 Ramakrishna's 
disciples. That is a crucial difference.=C2=A0 My compariso=
ns are always based NOT on 
my understanding, but clear words of great spir=
itual people. That is why I am 
100 perecent clear that Ramakrishna is spir=
itually higher than a Vivekananada or 
an Abhedananda. You may not want to =
judge them., thats your point of view. I on 
the other hand would rather re=
ly on the clear words of Vivekananda and 
Abhedananda on this matter rather=
 than speculation. Both Vivekananda and 
Abhedananda used to say Ramakrishn=
a is their Guru and spiritually far higher 
than they were. 

=C2=A0 
4) Wh=
ether Ramakrishna was a paramhamsa or a siddha in Vimalananda's scale is 
m=
erely your speculation. Vimalananda's books however betray no such speculat=
ion. 
I would rather rely on the words of the book. 

=C2=A0 
5) In this ag=
e everyone likes to take a title for himself. Many spiritual people 
name t=
hemselves Rishis, and we know it they are not.=C2=A0 So the Nityananda 
com=
parison does not stand. Vimalananda on his part never used any titles, not =

even the term Guru. I base my judgement of this man on a) critical study o=
f the 
books b) Manish's words. And I have not found you giving any sound l=
ogic for why 
I should change the same. 

=C2=A0 
6) If you do not want to =
compare spiritual people, that is perfectly fine. I or 
anyone else is not =
forcing you. However, that does not mean the world will not 
do so, special=
ly when the great spiritual people themselves have clearly done so 
on diff=
erent occassions. Vivekananda says Ramakrishna a greater spiritual man. I 
=
take his words as true. Period. 

=C2=A0 
Dear All,

This is hardly=
 a matter of parochialism. Please do not unnecessarily complicate

=C2=A0 
Namaste friends, 
=C2=A0 
This is a sma=
ll writeup on "siddhis" vis-a-vis spiritual progress, in reaction 
to furth=
er exchanges on Twitter. This is a delicate area where many have 
misconcep=
tions and I will try to address them.

=C2=A0 
M=
aharshi Vasishtha's teaching to Lord Rama is clear in Yoga Vaasishtham. The=
 
goal of existence and sadhana is self-realization. Siddhis are to be neit=
her 
specifically sought nor specifically avoided, by a seeker of Self. If =
Nature 
gives one some siddhi(s), one should accept them with neither excit=
ement nor 
disappointment. But one should NOT run after them, for they are =
neither 
necessary nor sufficient for self-realization and liberation. 

=
=C2=A0 
Vivekananda used the same principle when Ramakirishna proposed to g=
ive his 
siddhis to Vivekananda. He asked whether the siddhis will enable h=
im to realize 
god. Ramakrishna said no. Vivekananda firmly declined the of=
fer then! Of course, 
when Ramakrishna gave them anyway later, he accepted =
them. Vivekananda's two 
actions demonstrate Vasishtha's instructions well.=
 

=C2=A0 
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * 
=C2=A0 
Let us use the analogy of climbing a hi=
ll. Climbing hill is one's spiritual 
sadhana. Reaching the top is liberati=
on. Different people climb the hill from 
different sides and using differe=
nt paths. There may be trees with nice fruits 
on the sides of the road. Th=
ey are siddhis or special abilities. 

=C2=A0 
If one gets distracted, star=
ts climbing the trees and collecting fruits, one's 
journey gets delayed an=
d one may not reach the top. That is why Vasishtha says a 
seeker of Self d=
oes not pursue any siddhis. 

=C2=A0 
But if some fruits fall in one's lap =
by themselves, one can keep them. 
Similarly, siddhis that come to one by t=
hemselves can be accepted by a seeker of 
Self. 

=C2=A0 
Now an important =
distinction: 
=C2=A0 
There are some trees that are found at lower altitude=
s also, but some really 
special trees are found at very high altitudes onl=
y. If one has such a fruit, it 
shows that one has climbed great heights. S=
imilarly, some siddhis do not mean 
much, but some siddhis are very special=
 and only really elevated sadhakas can 
obtain them (whether by trying or w=
ithout trying). If a sadhakas demonstrates 
such a siddhi, you can see that=
 one progressed a lot. However, the key is that 
one who climbed the same o=
r more distance may not have that or any other fruit. 

=C2=A0 
*=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0 * 
=C2=A0 
Unlike in the example of climbing hill, which is an external=
 activity, spiritual 
progress in real life is *internal*. There is NO way =
for anyone to know for sure 
how much progress one has made, how much self-=
control one has internally and 
what exactly goes on in one's mind. We may =
try to judge it from external factors 
such as actions, words etc, but it i=
s not necessarily accurate. 

=C2=A0 
Here, some people swayed by siddhis m=
ay be tempted to use one's siddhis to judge 
how high one climbed. But that=
 is faulty. One person who reached the absolute 
top may not have any fruit=
s, while one person who still has ways to climb may 
have gotten some reall=
y nice fruit. Using externaslly demonstrable siddhis that 
are neither nece=
ssary nor sufficient for Self-realization as a measure of one's 
progress i=
s unsound. 

=C2=A0 
Given that spiritual progress is internal, how can we =
judge it and compare 
people then? Well, we need not and should not. Only a=
 sarvaantaryaami - a 
perfected being who has access to each being's intern=
al state - can do that.

=C2=A0 
Rajarshi, you ar=
e assuming that Ramakrishna Paramahamsa is a Paramahamsa on 
Vimalananda's =
scale. You are concluding that Ramakrishna is a Paramahamsa; 
Abhedananda, =
Vivekananda etc are lower than that; Vimalananda is a rishi; and 
hence Vim=
alananda is superior to Abhedananda and Vivekananda by 2pwr16 to 2. 

=C2=
=A0 
Is Paramahamsa Nithyananda, who was caught in a sex scandal, also a Pa=
ramahamsa 
because he is known so? See, how people are famously known may o=
r may not 
reflect their spiritual stature. Real spiritual stature is inter=
nal and you 
cannot see it. 

=C2=A0 
We do not know who Ramakrishna Parama=
hamsa really is. He may not be just a 
paramahamsa on Vimalananda's scale, =
but be a siddha or a natha or even a rishi. 
He may even be Vishnu himself,=
 as he himself said and some religious experts of 
that time declared based=
 on various signs. If Ramakrishna Paramahamsa is Vishnu 
himself, Vivekanan=
da, Abhedananda etc can definitely be rishis or naths in 
Vimalananda's sca=
le. If your argument is that they cannot be because they did 
not demonstra=
te siddhis compatible with that status, that is a non-point as I 
explained=
 above. The disagreement between then boils down a difference in the 
relev=
ance and importance of externally demonstrated siddhis.

=C2=A0 
Why this is relevant and I spent some time on this is tha=
t some people seem to 
have misconceptions. The take home for some people f=
rom some books describing 
miracles and siddhis may be that siddhis are imp=
ortant. 

=C2=A0 
Vasishtha is not only a rishi, but one of saptarshis. Ple=
ase read what he taught 
Lord Rama in Yoga Vaasishtham. It is the essence o=
f Veda and Upanishad. It will 
balance your views and mould your attitude. =
Read Yoga Vaasishtham. Siddhis are 
neither necessary nor sufficient for se=
lf-realization. Don't be distracted by 
them or be infatuated with them. 

=
=C2=A0 
The goal of sadhana is that your notions of "this is I and these ar=

subtler and subtler and hold of six internal enemies on you be=
comes weaker and 
weaker. Others may or may not be able to see and judge yo=
ur progress, but you 
know your progress and weaknesses the best. THAT is t=

Now, Ramakrishna himself said th=
at Vivekananda and six other sishyas were 
"Ishwara Koti" or "Nitya Siddhas=
". Can you tell me where this falls on 
Vimalananda's scale? What do you th=
ink "Nithya Siddha" (nithya=3Deternal) means? 
Is it Siddha or Mahasiddha o=
r even greater or in between? If six disciples were 
"Nithya Siddhas" and R=
amakrishna is "greater" as you say, can he be a 
"Paramahamsa" on this scal=
e, i.e. lower than them?>>

Simple! Ramakrishna says Vivekananda was a part=
 of a Rishi who came down. An 
amsa is not a Rishi in fullforce, but suffic=
ient part of the Rishi's 
consciousness that comes down for a secific purpo=
se and once the purpose is 
served, goes back to the source. Similar for=C2=
=A0the 6 Nitya-Siddhas. Therefore, 
very technically, Swami Vivekananda is =
an *amsa* of a Rishi, a projection of a 
Rishi. Not the Rishi is full. BTW,=
 all of these Siddhas, Naths, Munis etc are 
projection Rishis one way or t=
he other. Each is kept is ingorance of their real 
being (Rishi) such that =
the play can go on (not my words, Vimalananda's words). 
They are Nitya-sid=
dha because even if they take birth over and over, being parts 
of extremel=
y higher beings, these emanations/projections/amsas will surely 
eventually=
 go back to the source when the work is done. 


However, in their forms as=
 specific individuals like Vivekananda, whether these 
amsa attain the spec=
ific stages which makes a siddha/nath/muni/rishi will 
determine if they ar=
e to be called so. They may not need to do so since they are 
here for a pu=
rpose. But, the only way a person can be called a siddha in true 
sense is =
when he, as Vimalananda puts it, "picks a petal", (some specific 
shaktis)=
=C2=A0an "orbit" and moves closer to the Centre and yet not merging into it=
, 
deeper and deeper.=C2=A0 


There is a book of conversations between Tot=
apuri and a certain sadhaka (his 
disciple) when Totapuri lived in Puri. He=
 used to stay in the Swargadwara 
smashana and later someone build a small =
ashram for him. Totapuri's ashram still 
exists in Puri. In that conversati=
on, Totapuri also mentions a similar ideas of 
what is a siddha and higher.=
 And how only a Siddha and none less=C2=A0is a true 
Vigyani. He further me=
ntions that Swami Vivekananda did not (need) to=C2=A0go to the 
stage of a =
Siddha. His work was specific, he did the work and went off. He did 
not ne=
ed to and therefore did not=C2=A0become a Siddha. I see zero confusion here=
.

 more than your or mine. <FONT size=3D2></FONT></FONT></DIV>

<DIV align=3Dleft><FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D3 face=3DV=
erdana>2) Some siddhis as you noted are special. Only very higher level bei=
ngs can attain the same. Since the topic of siddhis did come up, Vimalanand=
a's ability to suck up a ton of mercury by Vajroli and bring it out from hi=
s hair infront of someone of Vishudhananda's spiritual calibre, is not a ea=
sy feat. This is not a run-of-the-mill siddhi. <FONT size=3D2></FONT></FONT=

<DIV align=3Dleft><FONT color=3D#00=
0000 size=3D3 face=3DVerdana>3) I never compared Vimalananda with Ramakrish=
na, but with Ramakrishna's disciples. That is a crucial difference.  M=
y comparisons are always based NOT on my understanding, but clear words of =
great spiritual people. That is why I am 100 perecent clear that Ramakrishn=
a is spiritually higher than a Vivekananada or an Abhedananda. You may not =
want to judge them., thats your point of view. I on the other hand would ra=
ther rely on the clear words of Vivekananda and Abhedananda on this matter =
rather than speculation. Both Vivekananda and Abhedananda used to say Ramak=
rishna is their Guru and spiritually far higher than they were. <FONT size=

<DIV align=3Dleft=
><FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D3 face=3DVerdana>4) Whether Ramakrishna was a=
 paramhamsa or a siddha in Vimalananda's scale is merely your speculation. =
Vimalananda's books however betray no such speculation. I would rather rely=
 on the words of the book. <FONT size=3D2></FONT></FONT></DIV>

></FONT></FONT></DIV>
<DIV align=3Dleft><FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D3 face=
=3DVerdana>5) In this age everyone likes to take a title for himself. Many =
spiritual people name themselves Rishis, and we know it they are not. =
 So the Nityananda comparison does not stand. Vimalananda on his part never=
 used any titles, not even the term Guru. I base my judgement of this man o=
n a) critical study of the books b) Manish's words. And I have not found yo=
u giving any sound logic for why I should change the same. <FONT size=3D2><=

you. However, that does not mean the world will not do so, specially when t=
