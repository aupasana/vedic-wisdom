Namaste Utpal,
 
Your understanding of nirvikalpa samadhi is not quite correct. Some people reaching nirvikalpa samadhi may not come back, but some people reaching nirvikalpa samadhi do come back and live their lives. In other words, some people jump from the "relative" side of the wall to the "absolute" side and stay there forever, while some people come back to the "relative side" to tell others about it.
 
Sahaja samadhi is a state where one is simultaneously on both sides and does not even see them as two different sides.
 
One more thing.. The absolute and the relative are not really two, but one. The relative is just a modification of the absolute. Shiva and Shakti are not two, but one. Normally we are in the field of Shakti and not aware of the underlying Shiva (we see various objects, but not the underlying Reality). In nirvikalpa samadhi, one is in the field of Shiva and not aware of the Shakti that manifested (i.e. one is absorbed in the underlying Reality, but not perceiving various objects). In sahaja samadhi, one is simultaneously aware of Shiva and Shakti and aware of them as One.
 
Normally, when the mind is perceiving the objects of dual polarities using jnanendriyas and the mind is engaging in actions of dual polarities using karmendriyas, it is difficult to not accumulate any conditioning such as likes, dislikes and impressions, and keep the consciousness absorbed in the Absolute.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

Savikalpa samadhi is a state of intense concentration of the mind, while creational variety or objectification still exists in the mind. One perceives that there is an "I" and there are "other" objects (e.g. deities, demons, people etc). But one is able to focus the mind intensely on one object (e.g. a deity) and able to achieve oneness with that object. Even reaching savikalpa samadhi is a tremendous thing and many great yogis also cannot go beyond savikalpa samadhi.
> >

One's consciousness is absorbed in supreme consciousness (Brahman or Aatman), without any perception of a variety of objects. This state is reached by very very few yogis.

When one sees a beautiful person, one's mind may get certain thoughts (depending on the experiences, values and desires accumulated from many lives). When somebody is praising one, one's mind may get certain thoughts. When somebody is criticizing one, one's mind may get certain thoughts. And so on. One's mind has likes, dislikes, attractions, repulsions etc, based on the accumulated experiences, values and desires of that individualized consciousness.
> >

One is actively living in the material world; one's mind is perceiving various objects of various attributes through jnanendriyas; and, one's mind is engaging in various actions in the material world though karmendriyas. Yet, one has no individualized conditioning or I-ness.

ALU is running several algorithms based on stored data and a lot of I/O data gets stored/retrieved from DRAM all the time. This is analogous to a person's normal state.
> >  
> > Nirvikalpa samadhi is like a state where the computer is in a power standby. On-board power supply is hardly supplying any power, all input and output channels are turned off, I/O controller is turned off and ALU is not running any algorithms. If a computer goes into power standy and exits it quickly, it will resume what it was doing before. Similarly, a person reaching nirvikalpa samadhi and leaving it quickly will resume previous activities. If a computer stays in the power standby for too long, it will be turned off and its state may be lost, i.e. it cannot resume. If one stays in nirvikalpa samadhi for too long, one will simply merge in Brahman and cannot resume previous activities.
> >  
> > Sahaja samadhi is akin to a computer running a bare minimum program that accesses a program running on a central super computer on a network. CPU, ALU, memory etc are running on a central super computer and our individual computer's CPU simply has a small routine that accesses the results of the algorithm running on the super computer and controls the local I/O controller accordingly. There isn't much data stored locally and there is no algorithm running locally. One's praanas are supplying power, one's jnanendriyas are getting inputs and one's karmendriyas are engaging in actions, one's manas is controlling this Input/Ouput activity and ahamkara (CPU) is controlling all this by running a small program that accesses a super computer that is monitoring all the computers of the world and deciding what this computer should do.

Some reach nirvikalpa samadhi, come back to regular consciousness after a while and start to accumulate conditioning again (chitta, i.e. DRAM). The CPU is running some program or the other, however small, and accumulating more data in DRAM and building up an algorithm in ALU. Minimization of I-ness is possible, but elimination of I-ness while embodied is very difficult! If any limited I-ness is left and any conditioning (I am this, I need this, I like this etc) is left, then it is NOT sahaja samadhi. Sahaja samadhi is a lack of limited individual I-ness and connecting the supreme universal I-ness directly to one's mind and body.
