Namaste,

Well, our shastras do not define a religion called "Hinduism". Ou=
r shastras define sanatana dharma - the perennial path of righteous duty. S=
anatana dharma is not an exclusive property of people born to "Hindu" paren=
ts. Sanatana dharma belongs to the entire world and encompasses every human=
 being whether or not one realizes it!

Some people who consider themselves=
 Hindus may or may not be following dharma well.

There may not be much dif=
ference between somebody from another religion with a strong interest in "H=
induism" and somebody born to Hindu parents but having either passive inter=
est or disinterest in Sanatana dharma and teachings of rishis. In fact, the=
 former may be a better adherent of Sanatana dharma than the latter in some=
 cases! If there is no need to convert the latter to "Hinduism", there is n=
o need to convert the former either!

Several ceremonies like naamakarana s=
amskaara (naming) are more social customs than dharmik matters.

In my opin=
ion, if a person is given a Vedic or Pouraanik mantra (any) by a decent gur=
u and asked to chant it everyday for an amount of time, and if he/she is ex=
posed to some scripture (e.g. Gita, Upanishads etc) and asked to read it, u=
nderstand it and let it affect one's thinking, I think one is then a Hindu,=
 i.e. one will soon find oneself adhering to Sanatana dharma. There is no n=
eed for any ceremonies.

=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

In fact, now there are some "for=
eigners" who perform a homam every weekend, to Ganapathi, Krishna etc. If a=
nybody thinks they are not "Hindus", one is not thinking straight. They are=
 more Hindus than many Hindus in India who have forgotten their dharma.

A =
braahmana's dharma is to pursue spiritual progress and engage the mind in t=
he god for the benefit of the world. One who does not spend time in japam o=
r homam for the benefit of the world is not a braahmana. If a foreigner is =
passionately interested in spiritual progress and does japam or homam every=
 day or week for the benefit of the world and one's own spiritual upliftmen=
t, such a foreigner is not only a Hindu, but also a braahmana.
