Namaste Rajarshi,

Rituals fall in two groups - those done for dharma and those done for 
moksha.

Sun and Moon were doing their dharma when they pointed out to Vishnu that 
Rahu was drinking amrita (nectar) and Vishnu did his dharma when he cut off 
the head of Rahu. The event of eclipse, in which Rahu and Ketu trouble Sun 
and Moon, is not conducive to dharma, i.e. adherence to the rules of 
engagement in the field of duality.

But it is conducive to spiritual experience of the underlying single reality 
where there is no duality (no god, no demon, no good, no bad). Torturing of 
Sun and Moon by Ketu is conducive to moksha. The eyes of the cosmic being, 
through which the variety of beings in this creation is observed, need to be 
closed in order to get out of the field of duality and become absorbed in 
Brahman.

At the time of eclipses, temples close and priests do not do temple rituals. 
However, for individual sadhana for spiritual progress, it is a great time. 
Some say that japam and homam done at the time of a homam gives 1000 times 
more result.

If you are doing a homam for spiritual progress, eclipse time is a great 
time to do homam.

Best regards,
Narasimha
