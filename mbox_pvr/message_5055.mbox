Namaste,
 
One may innocently believe that gods are sleeping in the night and you can only chant suprabhata (wakeup) prayers early in the morning and they cannot receive other prayers. However, gods are not really sleeping and do not need to be woken up. If you chant any mantra or any prayer, including Vishnu and Lalita sahasra naama stotras, it does reach them at all times.
 
The key is to chant with whatever level of mental focus, devotion and discipline one can manage.
 
*        *        *
 
The goal of any spiritual practice, whether it is chanting a mantra, meditation, bhajan, homam, tantra or whatever, is to affect an internal transformation.
 
External rituals help develop discipline, but, in order to bring internal transformation, they need to be augmented with some amount of contemplation. If one reads scriptures or books about modern saints like Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, the ideas from those books can serve as platforms of contemplation and bring about internal transformation.
 
It is a good idea to mix reading and thinking with rituals. 
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
