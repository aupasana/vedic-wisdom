Namaste friends,
=A0
There was a discussion on Lord Vishnu's Dasavataras on=
 a limited access forum on Facebook. A learned friend wrote that "Krshna is=
 the God-man", "Previous Avatars are a build-up to this stage" and "Buddha =
after Krshna is like going back from the linear progression of spirituality=
 that the Avatars manifest one after the other upto Krshna".
=A0
I want to =
emphatically disagree with this notion that Dasavatars of a "linear progres=
sion of spirituality..upto Krshna".
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Each avatara represents an aspect of Supreme in a perfec=
ted form.
=A0
Maharshi Parasara equated dasavataras with planets. For examp=
le, Rama, Krishna and Narasimha are Sun, Moon and Mars, respectively.
=A0
W=
e also know that Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and=
 Ketu are personifications of soul, mind, energy/initiative/drive, learning=
 spirit, wisdom/discrimination, spirit of enjoyment/being happy, patience/d=
iscipline, spirit of innovation/breaking barriers and detachment (respectiv=
ely).
=A0
Correspondingly, each avatara is an expression of that aspect of =
Supreme in a perfected form. Each story is an example of how that aspect op=
erates.
=A0
Lord Rama's story is a perfected example of how soul operates. =
Lord Krishna's story is a perfected example of how mind operates. Lord Vama=
na's story is a perfected example of how wisdom/discrimination operates. Lo=
rd Narasimha's story is a perfected example of how energy/drive/initiative =
operates.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Now, let =
us remember one basic thing. Soul in us, mind in us, energy in us, learning=
 spirit in us, wisdom in us, happiness in us, discipline/patience in us - a=
ll these are different manifestations of the same Self. However, when Self =
manifests as these different aspects, it has different qualities and plays =
different roles. There is no comparison between them.
=A0
We MAY focus on o=
ne aspect of us first, perfect it and then perfect other aspects through it=
. But, we need balance between all aspects in the end. Similarly, these dif=
ferent aspects of Supreme Being are incomparable and are in a balance worki=
ng together in the Cosmos.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0 *
=A0
One who is fascinated by the qualities of soul may like the story=
 that demonstrates how soul operates; one who is fascinated by the qualitie=
s of mind may like the story that demonstrates how mind operates, and one w=
ho is fascinated by the qualities of wisdom may like the story that demonst=
rates how wisdom operates. And so on. But this is just a matter of taste an=
d subjective preference.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 =
*
=A0
Let us focus on Rama and Krishna, i.e. soul and mind. Soul is seen as=
 a representative of god in us, because of some basic attributes of it. It =
is the higher self and has no agendas, no likes or dislikes.
=A0
Once mind =
fancies a separate existence with some agendas/desires, soul supports the i=
ndividualized consciousness stemming from that fancy and sees it as its dha=
rma. It lends strength and support to EVERY aspect of this individualized c=
onsciousness (e.g. mind, energy, intellect, learning ability, enjoyment, di=
scipline etc). It supports them fully and yet has no desires/agendas/likes/=
dislikes of its own! It impassionately witnesses and records all of one's a=
gendas and karmas so that Laws of Nature give proper fruits later on. It do=
es all that despite full awareness that it is neither doing those karmas no=
r receiving the fruits. As mind and other aspects of the individualized con=
sciousness entertain the notion that they are doing things and begetting th=
e fruits, soul supports them fully in this play. It sees that as its dharma=
 and does it impassionately.
=A0
Now, does this sound exciting? Perhaps not=
 to all. This functionality of an impassionate witness supporting the play,=
 may not seem interesting enough to some.
=A0
On the other hand, mind has l=
ikes, dislikes and agendas. It is constantly pursuing those agendas, gettin=
g things and achieving things. Movement of mind is what keeps the individua=
lization going!!! Though soul is the support for everything else in the ind=
ividualized consciousness, soul is a witness doing its dharma impassionatel=
y. It is mind that keeps the individualization going and brings in agendas =
and passion and even decides/affects every entity's dharma. That way, mind =
is really the "boss" of the individualization. No wonder Krishna's life app=
eals more to one who may be excited by this description!
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Lord Krishna is obviously awe-inspir=
ing, but let me put Rama's life in perspective.
=A0
Rama's life demonstrate=
s how soul operates. At a young age, he received Brahma Jnana from Vasishth=
a and became realized. Yet, he did whatever was his "dharma". He helped Vis=
hwamitra. Soon after marriage, he was given kingdom. At the last moment, hi=
s father banished him to forest at the behest of his step-mother and his st=
ep-brother was given the throne. He had no complaints. Though his father, s=
tep-mother and step-brother felt guilty to various degrees, he himself supp=
orted and consoled all three and followed his dharma impassionately. Though=
 he knew leaving Sita in the forest with Lakshmana and going after the gold=
en deer would cause problems, he did it impassionately when Sita insisted. =
When she was kidnapped by Ravana, he searched for her and fought the battle=
. He never faulted Sita for forcing him to leave her or faulted Lakshmana f=
or leaving her later. He accepted every life situation with no complaints a=
nd did the best possible action then. Even as
 he killed Ravana, he did so =
without hatred or anger, but as his impassionate dharma. Even as Ravana was=
 dying, he went to him and respectfully learned some subjects that were goi=
ng to disappear with Ravana!
=A0
Rama is a perfect example of a liberated m=
an with no desires or agendas who impassionately discharges one's dharma ar=
ising from the momentum of karmas before liberation. THAT is basically what=
 soul does!
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
As anot=
her example, let us look at Lord Vaamana. His story is a perfect demonstrat=
ion of how wisdom/discrimination operates.
=A0
He was born as a learned pyg=
my. He filled the entire cosmos to rid earth of a charitable demon king wit=
h many great qualities.
=A0
Wisdom/discrimination makes one humble and unas=
suming. When one is doing good work but tainted with demonic qualities (e.g=
. pride or attachment), one's discrimination is not pleased until that prid=
e is suppressed. When wisdom fills one's entire consciousness, then demonic=
 qualities are completely suppressed.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Please think about the other avataras. The stories can b=
e understood as perfect demonstrations of how various aspects of our consci=
ousness operate, based on clues from Maharshi Parasara.
=A0
Let us not comp=
are Dasavataras, but celebrate each of them separately. Of course, if you a=
re more attracted to one of them, please think about that avatara more and =
develop devotion. They are ALL capable of relieving us from samsara.
=A0
*=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
By the way, happy Hanuma=
jjayanti to those who celebrate it today (there are different schools of th=
ought).
=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha
