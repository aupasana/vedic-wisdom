Munda does not have such a meaning at all. It me=
ans  a head, especially a shaved head. It also symbolizes ego. Munda maala =
is a garland of heads and symbolizes the endless cycle of birth, death and =
rebirth.

Thank you for giving a classical reference to the SJC=
 version of planet-Mahavidya mapping. Do you know when Sri Narayanchandra J=
yotirbhushan Bhattacharya lived? If he does not name the tantra that he "ha=
s quoted from", that is not helpful. Munda Maala Tantra, on the other hand,=
 is a respected Tantra text.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

to do =
with cleansing the<BR>> Indriya per se, but the prevailing external 
for=
ces which we can map to our<BR>> horoscopes. Parasara of course teaches =
us 
that it is not one, but two or<BR>> more malefics that causes such 
=
pain.<BR>> <BR>> Baglamukhi is Mars, since she helps in lawsuits and =

contentious issues with<BR>> land. Both issues point to Mars as the kar=
aka in 
learner jyotish. Whilst we<BR>> are at it, I am surprised you di=
d not but her 
in the category of Venus, the<BR>> 2nd house lord of the =
natural horoscope

Out of al=

philosop=
hically sound mapping.<BR>> <BR>> Sun - Taaraa - Raama<BR>>

; 
*        
*    &n=
bsp;   *<BR>> <BR>> Vidya is 
knowledge. Mahavidya is supre=
me knowledge. Dasa mahavidyas are the<BR>> ten 
highest forms of knowled=
ge that take us to moksha or liberation,<BR>> 
approaching from differen=
t angles. Other kinds of knowledge (e.g.<BR>> 
mathematics, physics, ast=
ronomy, astrology, grammar etc) do not liberate 
us.<BR>> But these ten =
kinds of knowledge liberate us. The deities (names and 
forms<BR>> descr=
ibed in books for ten mahavidyas) are personifications of 
those ten<BR>>=
; types of supreme knowledge that liberate us.<BR>> <BR>> 
* &nb=
sp;      
*      &nb=
sp; *<BR>> <BR>> Please note one 
thing here. Moksha means overcoming=
 the maayaa of the<BR>> duality around us. 
Seeing some things as desira=
ble, some as undesirable,<BR>> some as 
pleasurable, some as painful, so=
me as beautiful, some as ugly etc is<BR>> 
what binds us. Overcoming the=
 duality and seeing all as Brahman is<BR>> 
liberation or moksha.<BR>>=
; <BR>> Different planets represent different 
aspects of our selves. Th=
e duality<BR>> around us and the way to overcome it 
seem different from=
 different angles.<BR>> From the point of view of 
individual soul (Sun)=
, this maayaa is something<BR>> that needs to be 
overcome by crossing a=
nd reaching the other end (supreme<BR>> cosmic soul). 
>From the point of=
 view of mind (Moon), this duality is<BR>> something that 
clouds the vi=
sion and needs to be destroyed so that it cannot<BR>> tempt 
again. From=
 the point of view of the intellect/discrimination/dhee<BR>> 
(Jupiter),=
 it issomething that is non-existent anyway ("so what was the<BR>> 
prob=
lem in the first place?"), like shapes made of smoke. From the point 
of<BR=
>> view of initiative and energy within us (Mars), it is something that =

needs<BR>> to be fought hard and fearlessly. From the point of view of =
the 
learning<BR>> ability within us (Mercury), it is something that nee=
ds to be 
learnt and<BR>> understood fully so that we can overcome it. F=
rom the point 
of view of<BR>> enjoyment and happiness (Venus), it is so=
mething that needs 
to be accepted<BR>> and enjoyed and not something to=
 fear or avoid ("after 
all, all is Brahman.<BR>> Then why stay away fro=
m enjoyments?"). And so 
on.<BR>> <BR>> But remember one important th=
ing. Whichever approach is 
taken to overcoming<BR>> duality, the end re=
sult is the same. One first 
masters the approach. It<BR>> becomes part =
of one's common sense and 
thinking. One eventually overcomes<BR>> duali=
ty. One becomes self-realized 
and becomes liberated. That end result is<BR=
>> the same irrespective of the 
approach chosen.<BR>> <BR>> *&nbs=
p;       
*     &nbs=
p;  *<BR>>  <BR>> Sun is the 
soul within us. The highest f=
orm of knowledge coming from delving<BR>> deep 
into this aspect is what=
 makes one wade (tar=3Dswim/wade/cross) the ocean<BR>> 
of delusion and =
get to the source. If you master the knowledge that 
helps<BR>> one view=
 the world as an ocean that needs to be crossed to reach 
the<BR>> supre=
me, other things will follow and you eventually get liberation. 
Taaraa<BR>=
> personifies this knowledge.<BR>>  <BR>> Moon is the 
mind w=
ithin us. The highest form of knowledge coming from<BR>> delving deep 
i=
nto this aspect is an understanding of attachments and<BR>> desires, the=
ir 
impermanence and how to kill them. If you master the<BR>> knowledge =
that 
kills all attachments and desires and gives perfect control<BR>> o=
n the mind, 
other things will follow and you eventually get liberation.<BR=

personifies this knowledge.<BR>>  <BR>> Mars is the=
 energy and 
initiative within us. The highest form of knowledge<BR>> co=

universe. If you master the knowledge that makes y=
ou utterly<BR>> fearless 
and you do not fear anything (including death =
or pain!) other<BR>> things 
will follow and you eventually get liberati=
on. Bhairavi personifies<BR>> this 
knowledge.<BR>>  <BR>> Me=
rcury is knowledge and learning ability 
within us. The highest form of<BR>=
> knowledge coming from delving deep into 
this aspect is what gives one=
<BR>> learning of various topics. If you master 
the knowledge that give=
 you<BR>> mastery of all kinds of learning through 
logical and rational=
 thinking,<BR>> other things will follow and you 
eventually get liberat=
ion. Maatangi<BR>> personifies this knowledge. In fact, 
some people ass=
ociate Maatangi with<BR>> Saraswati. Saraswati is also known 
as "Maatan=
ga Kanya".<BR>> <BR>> Jupiter is the intellect, wisdom and 
discrimin=
ation (dhee shakti) within us.<BR>> The highest form of knowledge 
comin=
g from delving deep into this aspect is<BR>> that all is delusion. The 
=
individual soul and individual mind and everything<BR>> they perceive is=
 just 
an illusion. All that is there is Brahman. Any other<BR>> percept=
ions, of 
various good or bad things, are just a delusion, like<BR>> fig=
ures made of 
smoke. If you master the knowledge that makes your intellect<=
BR>> shine, you 
will realize that the entire world is a delusion and no=
t deluded<BR>> by 
anything anymore. Then other things will follow and y=
ou eventually get<BR>> 
liberation. Dhumaavati personifies this knowledg=
e.<BR>> <BR>> Venus is the 
spirit of enjoyment and bliss. The highes=
t form of knowledge<BR>> coming from 
delving deep into this aspect is w=
hat makes one egoless and<BR>> blissful. If 
you master the knowledge th=
at makes you utterly fearless and<BR>> you do not 
fear anything, includ=
ing death or pain, other things will follow<BR>> and you 
eventually get=
 liberation. Chhinnamasta personifies this knowledge.<BR>> She 
is depic=
ted as a deity holding her own severed head, standing near a<BR>> 
naked=
 couple in copulation and surrounded by associates who are drinking<BR>>=
 
wine. One mastering this knowledge need not stay away from any 
pleasures=
,<BR>> but one learns to see god even those pleasures. However, 
pleasur=
e obtained<BR>> with an ego ("*I* am enjoying this act or object") 
bind=
s. The headless state<BR>> symbolizes egolessness. If one has overcome 
=
I-ness, pleasures are not<BR>> binding. One not thinking in terms of "*I=
* am 
enjoying" but having no sense<BR>> of "I" can live life without ru=
nning away 
from any pleasures or undertaking<BR>> any austerities and y=
et become 
liberated.<BR>> <BR>> Saturn is the spirit of hard work wi=
thin us. He also 
represents our<BR>> weaknesses and sins. The highest f=
orm of knowledge coming 
from delving deep<BR>> into this aspect is what=
 makes us realize our internal 
enemies and destroy<BR>> them. If you ma=
ster the knowledge that makes you 
overcome weaknesses such as<BR>> lazi=
ness and internal enemies such as lust, 
anger, greed, jealosy etc, other<B=
R>> things will follow and you eventually 
get liberation. Bagalamukhi<B=
R>> personifies this knowledge. Most of her 
mantras ask to destroy enem=
ies and<BR>> so people foolishly think that she is 
the one who gives su=
ccess in<BR>> litigation and worship her for court cases. 
This is like =
going to a king to<BR>> ask for two spoons of sugar for your 
milk. You =
go to the king for bigger<BR>> things and a neighbor is enough for 
givi=
ng you two spoons of sugar. The<BR>> enemies destroyed by Bagalamukhi ar=
e 
internal enemies and your own laziness.<BR>> Remember, she is a mahav=
idya, 
i.e. a type of supreme knowledge that<BR>> liberates you!<BR>>=
  
<BR>> Rahu is the spirit of material well-being within us. Rahu =
is the one 
who<BR>> binds us to rebirth (this is why Saturn showing sin=
s and Rahu 
showing<BR>> rebirth are important in the death chart). The =
highest form of 
knowledge<BR>> coming from delving deep into this aspec=
t is what gives us 
worldly success<BR>> in a dhaarmik way. If you maste=
r the knowledge that 
makes you materially<BR>> successful in a dharmik =
way, you become successful 
and fulfil all your<BR>> duties and debts in=
 the world and eventually get 
liberation. Bhuvaneswari<BR>> personifies=
 this knowledge.<BR>> <BR>> 
Ketu is the spirit of of detachment and =
Vedic knowledge within us. The<BR>> 
highest form of knowledge coming fr=
om delving deep into this aspect is 
the<BR>> essense of Veda. If you ma=
ster the knowledge that enables you to be 
in<BR>> oneness with the supr=
eme cosmic being, you eventually get liberation. 
Kamala<BR>> (Mahaalaks=
hmi) personifies this knowledge. According to 
saptashati rahasya<BR>> a=
lso, Mahaalakshmi is the Aadyaa (the first One). She 
is the energy of<BR>&=
gt; supreme cosmic being. She divides Herself into 3 parts 
- Mahaakaali,<B=
R>> Mahaalakshmi and MahaaSaraswati and they create Brahma, 
Vishnu, Shi=
va and<BR>> their consorts. Kamala represents the knowledge of the 
supr=
eme cosmic energy<BR>> of the supreme cosmic being.<BR>> <BR>> 
*&=
nbsp;       
*     &=
nbsp;  *<BR>> <BR>> One of the above 
is not superior to the oth=
er. Depending on your vasanas<BR>> (mental 
conditioning), attitudes, li=
kes and dislikes, depending on which<BR>> aspect 
of your personality do=
minates over other aspects (the sinfulness and<BR>> 
weaknesses? or the =
interest in learning things? or the spirit of 
fighting?<BR>> or the sen=
se of enjoyment? etc), one Mahavidya may be more 
suitable than<BR>> oth=
ers, as that knowledge uses your strong aspect and 
moulds that aspect to<B=
R>> take you towards liberation. Do not compare them. 
Take the one that=
 is most<BR>> suitable, but do master that aspect.<BR>> 
<BR>> *&n=
bsp;       
*     &n=
bsp;  *<BR>> <BR>> There are some 
who do Dasa Mahavidya sadhana=
 by doing one Mahavidya's mantra<BR>> for one 
month, then switch to ano=
ther and so on. They think that by doing<BR>> each 
mahavidya mantra for=
 a certain count, they "finish" the mahavidya<BR>> 
sadhana. This is wro=
ng and serves no useful purpose. Instead, one should<BR>> 
pick any ONE =
mahavidya and succeed in that sadhana. The definition of<BR>> 
success i=
s that the knowledge represented by that deity becomes part of 
your<BR>>=
; common sense - you understand that knowledge and ooze that 
knowledge in =
your<BR>> thoughts and actions. Whether you experience the deity 
as an =
external<BR>> human-like form (who may impart some knowledge to you) or =

as an internal<BR>> human-like form or as light or as sound is secondar=
y, but 
the end result<BR>> should be that the knowledge represented by =
Her should 
become common sense<BR>> and second nature to you. One claim=
ing visions or 
siddhi of a mahavidya but<BR>> not showing the correspon=
ding knowledge is 
bluffing.<BR>> <BR>> There are many people who do =
mahavidya sadhana and 
yet many others who claim<BR>> to have siddhi in =
one or more mahavidyas, but 
very few who actually possess<BR>> any of t=
he ten mahavidyas. The area of 
mahavidya sadhana is one of the most<BR>>=
; ill-understood in today's age of 
ignorance and half-baked knowledge. It =
is<BR>> easier to possess lower vidyas 
or lower shaktis, but mahavidyas=
 are beyond<BR>> the capability of
