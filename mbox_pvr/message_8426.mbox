Namaste friends,

When talking about god and spirituality, misunderstandings may crop into 
one's understanding of what someone else is saying (I will elaborate 
this below).

So I humbly suggest that people should be patient and compassionate when 
discussing spiritual matters with others and not get provoked easily or 
fight when a serious differences are perceived.

*        *        *

Let me first give a non-spiritual analogy.

Suppose I say that solving "differential equations" is important. One 
who does not know advanced mathematics may not know what "differential 
equation" means. He may think that differential means "relating to 
differences" and "equation" means "equating or making equal". He may 
think that "differential equation" means "removing differences and 
changing different things to become equal". Of course, one knowing 
mathematics knows that that is nonsense.

*        *        *

When we use words to communicate, we acquire an understanding of what 
different words mean, through correlating previous experiences with 
words being used by people around us during or after an experience. When 
someone describes something we have absolutely no clue about, we may 
totally miss the point and acquire a wrong (or superficial) 
understanding (as in the above analogy). When it comes to god and 
spirituality, this is particularly likely. Different people have 
different understanding of some keywords we often use.

*        *        *

First, take the word God. If one person values smartness and abilities, 
his notion of God may be a super-being who is very smart and highly 
capable. If another person values control and power, his notion may be a 
powerful being who is controlling everyone. If another person values 
discipline and orderliness, his notion may be an impassionate 
super-being who maintains order in the word. If another person values 
love and compassion, his notion may be a super-being who loves all 
beings. Some of these notions are quite conflicting!

When we talk about God and spirituality, our notions of God find a way 
into our words, language, tone and even sub-text. That may sometimes 
make someone whose notions are different jump up. When something 
inexpressible or infinite is expressed in finite words (or, at another 
level, when people discuss what they have no direct experience of), such 
conflicts and confusions are to be expected.

*        *        *

Suppose a book talks about the great importance of being veera (brave) 
in spiritual sadhana. The book may mean being brave in encountering 
one's internal weaknesses and conditioning. But one may see the word 
veera as hinting at being externally brave and aggressive with others. 
One may think he is following the book, but end up doing something else. 
In another case, one may understand the subtleties and be working on 
overcoming inherent self-centeredness and weaknesses such as jealosy, 
greed, anger etc. Yet, use of words like "veera" by that person may 
offend someone else valuing compassion and love and seeing the word 
veera as being aggressive and uncompassionate towards others.

*        *        *

I can give many examples. The bottomline is that we are on thin ice when 
discussing very subtle concepts like god and spiritual progress. Fools 
rush where wise tread carefully. Most of us (don't mean to offend 
anyone, this includes me too) are fools who want to talk too much 
instead of listening more.

My main message here is that misunderstandings are to be expected. We 
can never use words to replicate the thinking in our minds in other 
minds. Tottally different thinking may be induced by the same words in 
different minds. So, be patient and compassionate when you encounter 
views that make no sense to you. Always give the benefit of doubt and 
don't jump to conclusions or get provoked and become aggressive or 
confrontational. Then, there is SOME chance of finding a common ground 
oneday.

Hope I made some sense!

Best regards,
Narasimha
