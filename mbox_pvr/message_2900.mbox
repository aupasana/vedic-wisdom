Namaste,
 
1] Practice brings familiarity, that brings fluency and that brings speed. However, please remember that reading mantras is not a race. Having the right feeling and right pronunciation is important. If speed comes at the cost of those, it is not worth it.
 
I know people who took 3 hours to read 13 chapters when they first tried and then came down to 1 hour with practice.
 
2] It is ok.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
