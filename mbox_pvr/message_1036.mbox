Namaste,

This is the right forum.

Tarpana need not be performed only oneday a year. It can be a regular 
sadhana. It is not for giving moksha to a soul. It is for releasing a few 
negative attachments that are blocking a departed mind from going to higher 
lokas or take birth again. If one has rina (debt) with such a mind, the 
negative attachments and tendencies of that departed mind will influence 
one's mind too. Rituals like tarpana free the dearted mind from the blocking 
predispositions and also free one's mind of that influence.

Here is an answer from the pitri tarpana manual:

-----------------------------------------
"External rituals are meant to create the internal visualization needed to 
affect desirable internal changes in the long run. For example, one offers a 
full coconut into fire as poornaahuti (complete offering) at the end of a 
homam (fire ritual). This is symbolic of surrendering one's head or ego 
(sense of I-ness) to god and burning it in the fire of wisdom and becoming 
free from ego. As one keeps engaging in this act again and again, the 
visualization becomes stronger and stronger and ego is slowly reduced.

"One important ritual of Hinduism is tarpana. Tarpana means "satisfying" or 
"satiating". One acknowledges the debt one has to devas (gods), rishis 
(sages) and pitris (ancestral manes) and tries to satisfy them using this 
ritual. Just as gods are invoked in fire in a homam, pitris are invoked in 
water in this ritual, then held in the palm and released in a specific way 
conducive to freeing them.

"One owes a lot to one's parents and ancestors. In modern scientific terms, 
one owes all of one's genetic characteristics to one's parents and 
ancestors. Each ancestor is actually present in the person as a genetic 
characteristic. In karmik terms, one inherits some karmas of one's parents 
and ancestors and each ancestor is actually present in the person as a 
kaarmik predisposition. The latter approach obviously extends to multiple 
lives and some karmik predisposition is inherited from the ancestors from a 
past life too, though they may not be related to one in this life.

"By thinking of the deceased ancestors with gratitude and trying to give 
them an emancipation, one is actually trying to free oneself from various 
kaarmic predispositions that one has as a result of the rina (karmik debt) 
with several people. One can view this as an external event of satisfying 
and emancipating an external entity (a pitri). Alternately, one can view 
this as an internal event of satisfying and releasing an internal kaarmik 
predisposition. Ultimately, it is the latter. However, one needs to 
externalize first and perform external rituals, while thinking of what it 
means internally. This builds up one's visualization and slowly brings about 
internal changes and eventually the desired internal change itself."

Narasimha
