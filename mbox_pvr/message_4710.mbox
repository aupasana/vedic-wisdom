Namaste,

Interestingly, two good saints claimed to be re-incarnations of R=
amakrishna 
since then. One of them is wrong (or perhaps both!). Another go=
od saint 
suggested that she is the re-incarnation of Sarada Mata. Satya Sa=
i Baba said 
that he identified a particular young man as the reincarnation=
 of Swami 
Vivekananda. Ramakrishna was surrounded by Sarada Mata and more =
than twenty 
disciples of a very high caliber and different aptitudes. Toge=
ther, they nearly 
moulded the direction of spiritual India for the next ce=
ntury. None of the 
claimants of rebirthhood are surrounded by people of su=
ch caliber or fit the 
bill.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
This is a powerful and lo=
gically correct observation by Narasimha. Anyone who 
claims to be Ramakris=
hna or Ma Sarada, MUST BE associated and surrounded by a 
bunch of ATLEAST =
15/20 very high caliber sadhakas.=C2=A0 These very high caliber 
sadhakas=
=C2=A0who will surround a reborn Ramakrishna or Ma Sarada will each be like=
 
spiritual stalwarts in their own rights, like each of Ramakrishna and Ma =

Sarada's disciples were (Swami Brahmananda, Swami Premananda, Swami Sivana=
nda 
etc etc) when they had=C2=A0incarnated. 

=C2=A0
So unless this condit=
ion is met, (which Ramakrishna himself had specified in his 
last birth), m=
ost of the Ramakrishna or Ma Sarada reincarnation-claimants have 
to be dis=
-qualified. 

=C2=A0
Some people have an impression that if and when Ramakr=
ishna and Ma Sarada and 
Swamiji reincarnate, they would have an associatio=
n with the Ramakrishna 
Mission. This is, in my opinion, an incorrect assum=
ption. When Lord Krishna was 
born, he did not spend his time trying to fin=
d out where is Ayodhya since he 
was=C2=A0also=C2=A0Lord Rama is his=C2=A0p=
ast life. Similarly,=C2=A0these souls (Ramakrishna and 
Ma=C2=A0Sarada and =
their disciples)=C2=A0are of such high caliber that they do come back 
when=
 it is designed and needed for them to come back and perform some strong 
o=
bjectives and set in motion a spiritual impulse in this land based on the 
=
necessities of the specific desh-kaal-patra. Therefore what they do will be=
 
based purely on the zeitgeist - spirit of the times - when they incarnate=
.=C2=A0 For 
all one knows, Ramakrishna may not incarnate as a simple rusti=
c villager any 
more, but rather=C2=A0as a well-educated,=C2=A0city-bred in=
dividual with the practical 
intelligence of ten Chanakyas who might end up=
 changing the political and 
spiritual future of this land for centuries to=
 come, which is what the necessity 
of the present=C2=A0times really are. 
=

=C2=A0
We already have an overdose of Swamis and Babas and Mas and Bhagwan=
s and their 
ashrams and their teeming millions as followers. What we need =
is someone who=C2=A0may 
or may not have an ashram, who may or may not pose=
 as a Guru in the traditional 
sense, who may or may not be a glib talker (=
as so many of the Babas and Mas are 
these days), but who has the necessary=
 might and power to affect or initiate 
changes in this land which would be=
 of an irrevocable nature.=C2=A0 It is time for a 
1000 years of history to=
 change. And only a soul of Ramakrishna or Ma Sarada's 
caliber can do it. =
Anyone lesser, would only fizz out=C2=A0with time.
=C2=A0
Not that=C2=A0the=
y (Ramakrishna or Ma Sarada or=C2=A0Swamiji) will find the work to be 
easy=
 at all. For startes, the dunces would be in confederacy against them. When=
 
Vivekanada, before he became world famous, had gone to Kasi, he was bitte=
rly 
opposed by the 'scholarly' pandits of the city on various issues. Then=
 a young 
not-yet-famous Vivekananda got angry and decided he will leave Ka=
si and never 
return to that city untill he "falls on society like a thunde=
rbolt". Well, that 
is precisely what he did. He fell on Indian society lik=
e a thunderbolt, after 
which those very pandits of Kasi wrote to him, aski=
ng him to come and grace 
their city! 

=C2=A0
So let us keep our fingers c=
rossed and not=C2=A0focus on emtpy speculations, rather 
wait for the most =
interesting coming=C2=A0decade to unfold in all its=C2=A0sound and fury.

Namaste Ranjan,

> After you=
 die, what would be your name and religion and nationality

Name can change=
 on rebirth. Though religion usually stays the same, it CAN 
change. Nation=
ality can of course change too. Job, skills, external nature, 
looks, gende=
r, even yoni (human, cow, goat, chicken, tiger etc) can all change 
from bi=
rth to birth.

Basically, the seed of one's new birth is formed at the time=
 of one's death. As 
one's connection is severed with the body, the last de=
sires/thoughts/ponderings 
of the mind become the seed for the next life. N=
ature chooses for one a future 
course that allows one to pursue those desi=
res, as much as allowed by one's 
previous karmas and debts.

If one is abl=
e to not entertain ANY desire as one element after another 
evaporates in o=
ne's existence, one becomes liberated. All the spiritual sadhana 
we do is =
a dress rehearsal.

* * *

> when we see you again and do you know how we
>=
 shall recognize you, IF WE EVER MEET YOU?

If I and you like each other an=
d your rebirth and my rebirth meet each other, 
they will start off taking =
a liking to each other. If I and you dislike each 
other and your rebirth a=
nd my rebirth meet each other, they will start off 
disliking each other. T=
his will happen without either being consciously aware of 
who one was and =
who the other person was, in the last life.

Instead, if your question is h=
ow we can recognize that so and so person is a 
rebirth of Swami Vivekanand=
a, so and so person is a rebirth of Paramahamsa 
Yogananda etc, the answer =
is complex.

The reborn person may not look like the old person or do simil=
ar work or have 
much *external* similarity. So it is difficult to "recogni=
ze" one. After all, 
Rama advocated eka patni vrata (one wife principle), w=
hile Krishna had thousands 
of wives. Rama was a great warrior and killed R=
avana in the biggest war of his 
times. Krishna was a key player in the big=
gest war of his time, but did not take 
a weapon at all. The game can be di=
ffent in each coming..

* * *

When it comes to recognizing the rebirth of =
a great soul, it can become a trap.

Ramakrishna explicitly told Sarada Mat=
a that he would be back after 100 years 
and that everybody else who came w=
ith him would have to come back with him. When 
Sarada Mata and Lakshmi Dev=
i protested, he said they did not have a choice! Even 
Swami Vivekananda sa=
id once in USA, "I have to come back once more. The Master 
said I am to co=
me back once more with him". When questioned "you have to come 
back becaus=
e Shri Ramakrishna says so", he replied, "souls like that have great 
power=
, Madam". On another occasion, Ramakrishna said that people would get 
libe=
rated en masse during his next coming and that would be the last opportunit=
y 
for a long time to come.

Interestingly, two good saints claimed to be r=
e-incarnations of Ramakrishna 
since then. One of them is wrong (or perhaps=
 both!). Another good saint 
suggested that she is the re-incarnation of Sa=
rada Mata. Satya Sai Baba said 
that he identified a particular young man a=
s the reincarnation of Swami 
Vivekananda. Ramakrishna was surrounded by Sa=
rada Mata and more than twenty 
disciples of a very high caliber and differ=
ent aptitudes. Together, they nearly 
moulded the direction of spiritual In=
dia for the next century. None of the 
claimants of rebirthhood are surroun=
ded by people of such caliber or fit the 
bill.

Thus, there can be false c=
laimants to the rebirthhood of a great soul! It is not 
that they are lying=
. They may simply be deluding themselves and of course ego is 
the root of =
delusion!

In fact, is it necessary to recognize whether X is a rebirth of =
Y, given that X 
and Y are different and play a different game? A small dis=
cussion on this point 
vis-a-vis Ramakrishna Paramahamsa's example can be f=
ound in:

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/807

* * *

Th=
ough external factors like nationality, religion, name, job, looks, gender =
etc 
can change, some internal factors may remain the same. Moreover, who o=
ne likes, 
who one dislikes, what values one is attracted to internally, et=
c, may remain 
essentially the same.

For example, suppose rajput king Prit=
hviraj was reborn as Muslim emperor Akbar 
(as said by Vimalananda). One wa=
s a Hindu and the other was a Muslim. However, 
both were very brave, unafr=
aid of death, inherently spiritual, had a refined 
taste in fine arts and h=
ad deep conviction. The previous connections with 
rajputs resulted in Akba=
r being born and raised when his mother was hiding at a 
rajput household, =
before moving to Delhi. Despite being a Muslim, he actually 
helped the Hin=
du causes (to the extent possible at that time) by putting an end 
to barba=
ric practices like killing defeated Hindu kings and all Hindu priests in 
c=
onquered places. He promoted acceptance of other faiths, canceled pilgrimag=
e 
taxes on Hindus and even came up with his own religion of humanity towar=
ds the 
end of his life by integrating various religions. In one life, he t=
ried to save 
India from invading barbarians. In another, he was born as a =
cultured man amid 
barbarians and tried to save India by changing the ways =
of his own people. There 
is a subtle continuity in the agenda at a deeper =
level!

Narasimha
