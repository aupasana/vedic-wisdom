Namaste,

If the money you gave was used for a sin, you will get a portion of the sin. 
But it is usually less than the punya you get. When you know ahead that the 
money will be misused, do not give to that person. When you do not know, 
take a chance and give it.

If you donate with pride and ego, the negative effect of the bad deeds done 
with that money are increased. If you donate without pride and thinking that 
god is using you to give god's money to god, then the negative effects of 
the bad deeds done with that money are minimized.

Best regards,
Narasimha
