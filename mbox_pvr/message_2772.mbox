Your statement is strange because ahamkaara and =
asmitaa are THE SAME. Upanishads used the word "ahamkaara", while Patanjali=
 used the word "asmitaa" to describe the SAME entity.
 
aham=3DI
kaara=3Dne=
ss
ahamkaara=3DI-ness
 
asmi=3D[I] am
taa=3Dness
asmitaa=3D"[I] am"-ness, i=
.e. I-ness
 
Both are different words for the same thing, i.e. I-ness or eg=
o principle or self-identification or the sense that "I am so and so". Neit=
her refers just to the body, but to ANY notion of "I am this".
 
*        *=
        *
 
Suppose someone writes something bad about "Narasimha" and supp=
ose I am offended when I read it, thinking "I" am being criticized. Here I =
may have a mental object called "Narasimha", whom I may see as being attack=
ed when I read that mail, though nothing is being done to any physical body=
. My self-identification with this mental object (i.e. thinking that "I am"=
 that mental object), is ahamkaara or asmitaa too. Self-identifying with th=
at mental object and using it as an instrument of experiencing, I may somet=
imes experience happiness (e.g. when someone writes great things about "Nar=
asimha") and sometimes experience sadness (e.g. when someone writes bad thi=
ngs about "Narasimha"). As long as I do that, I am bound.
 
The concept of =
ahamkaara or asmitaa or I-ness is not restricted to identification with a p=
hysical body at all.
 
*        *        *
 
Regarding your understanding o=
f "asmitaa", you wrote earlier:
 
> identification of the seer with the ins=
trument of
> seeing i.e. Physical senses.
 
You simply jumped to the conclu=
sion that physical senses and physical body are the only instrument of seei=
ng (or experiencing) and restricted asmitaa to the physical body. That is n=
ot correct. Mind is an instrument of seeing/experiencing too. For example, =
things seen or experienced in a dream or in meditation are not seen using t=
he physical senses. They are seen by the mind. The yoga sutra of Patanjali =
that you referred to actually defined asmitaa (I-ness) as identification wi=
th ANY instrument that allows one to have experiences. This is certainly no=
t limited to the physical body.
 
BTW, Swami Satchidananda's commentary on =
Patanjali's Yoga Sutras explicitly mentions body and mind when translating =
this particular sutra.
 
*        *        *
 
Patanjali, upanishads, Bhaga=
vad Gita, Yoga vaasishtham etc - they are all fantastic sources of knowledg=
e and they would never contradict each other. Unfortunately, people with a =
limited understanding of a limited amount of scriptures start arguing and m=
ake it sound like one scripture vs the other.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

 Manas and Buddhi being two of the Causal-ideas, their functioning as well =
as existence is not "controlled" nor "derived" in any way by the idea of Ah=
amkara. It is very clear when we see those with sharpest Buddhi or Sharpest=
 Mind still carrying Heaviest Ahamkara, because they didn't work upon that =
particular idea.

 astral-bodied beings can use any of the senses like eyes to see, hear, sme=
ll, taste and so on (refer Autobiography of a Yogi)... the sense of egoism =
does not take roots in the astral-body and hence doesn't create Astral Karm=
a. Similarly, Causal bodied beings can use thought to sense everything.

 am afraid you are mixing up terminologies. For example, ego or ahamkaara (=
sense of I-ness) is not limited to the physical body, but extends to subtle=
 body and causal body as well. In fact, ego resides in the causal body and =
affects other bodies. Out of the four antahkaranas, chitta (remembering or =
conditioned mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are parts of the kaarana sa=
reera (causal body) and remain till the end.

kaara/ego controls manas and buddhi also. When manas (sensory-motor mind) o=
bserves sensory inputs or buddhi (intellectual or thinking mind) analyzes c=
urrent and past observations of mind or chitta (remembering or conditioned =
mind) stores various observations or retrieves previously stored observatio=
ns, they are all guided by the sense of I-ness. That sense of I-ness permea=
tes through all layers of one's individualized consciousness.
