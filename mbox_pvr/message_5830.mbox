Namaste,
=C2=A0
Be=
tel leaves are not necessary. In fact, betel leaves themselves are a substi=
tute.
=C2=A0
The original method is to create aasanas (seats) for planets a=
nd other celestial beings with different grains. For example, go to the Bos=
ton saamoohika Satya Narayana vratam album at
=C2=A0
https://picasaweb.goog=
le.com/padmaja.bandaru/BostonSaamoohikaSatyanarayanaVratam
=C2=A0
and see p=
hoto 6 or 13. Seats are made with different grains arranged in different ba=
sic geometric shapes.
=C2=A0
Instead of that elaborate arrangement, the tra=
dition of using a betel leaf as the seat for each planet/deity has come.
=
=C2=A0
If you just lay out a few rice grains for each deity and place the i=
dol/coin on them, that is fine too.
=C2=A0
The planets and deities are alre=
ady within us. For example, Jupiter lives in us as our wisdom and judgment.=
 Saturn lives within us as our discipline, patience and persistence. Yama l=
ives within us as discipline and the ability to follow rules. Nirriti lives=
 within us as the spirit of discovery and crossing barriers. And so on. If =
those qualities are firmly established in one's consciousness, what seat is=
 offered to corresponding deities in the ritual is highly secondary!
=C2=A0=

Irrespective of what seat you use (made of grains arranged in a shape or b=
etel lead or just rice grains), contemplate the nature represented by the d=
eity and imagine that the deity has really come and sat there.
=C2=A0
Best =

Narasimha
