Namaste,

Thanks for sharing your experience. Yes, agni in homa amplifies the effects. 
But others may also note that these things depend on the individual and 
there are two main factors at play here.

We perform karmas and we receive the fruits of those karmas. The order in 
which the fruits are received is in the hands of nature (god). Depending on 
the karma-fruit pipeline of a person, one may or may not see the fruit of 
certain action immediately. One with a deep pipeline may not see the result 
of performing homam in an iron homa kundam immediately. By the time the 
result comes, it may not be obvious why. On the other hand, one with a 
shallow pipeline may see the results relatively sooner and realize the 
correlation between action and result!

Secondly, the deity being worshipped also matters. Suppose you offer spoiled 
milk to a friend. If he is a soft-natured person, he will drink a little, 
leave the rest and go away calmly. If he is blunt on the other hand, he will 
drink a little, tell you that the milk is spoiled and perhaps yell a little 
at you, give you a piece of his/her mind and then leave. Which kind of 
friends are better for you depends on your nature!

Similarly, if you worship soumya devatas (Sadashiva, Lakshmi, Vishnu etc) 
and your worship has flaws, the deity ignores it and waits till you correct 
the flaws. If you worship ugra devatas (e.g. Bhairava, Rudra, Kaali, 
Narasimha etc) and your worship has flaws, the deity will ensure that you 
get the message sooner.

*        *        *

When you buy wood logs from some stores, they stick a big iron staple in a 
log or two so that the logs and the plastic wrapper stay together. We 
normally use the unstapled logs first and use the stapled logs after 
removing the iron staple.

Oneday I ran out of logs and the only log I had had an iron staple. I 
decided to use it without removing the iron staple in it. I thought, "well, 
this is a Saturday and Saturn likes iron. Let me just offer it like this." I 
did it and forgot about it later.

That day, I had a really bad sprain in a muscle at the back of my lungs and 
suffered for two days. When doing the daily Chandi homam on Sunday, a 
thought suddenly came to me. I suddenly remembered that I put a log with a 
fat iron staple in it in fire the previous day. The thought that came to me 
was that I did a mistake and nature pointed it out to me in this way.

When we make mistakes and nature shows our mistakes to us, we need not worry 
or panick. We should just learn the lesson and move on.

*        *        *

I still say that a homam in an iron or aluminum tray is still better than 
nothing. The gain is higher than loss due to mistake. But, one can try to 
avoid the mistake when it is possible.

Best regards,
Narasimha
