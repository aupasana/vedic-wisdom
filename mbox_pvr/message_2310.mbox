Dear Prasad and Narayan,
 
One may type mails using one's own words. But, are they really one's own words and one's own ideas? One expresses what one has realized based on reading various masters, discussing with one's guru(s), meditating, contemplating and eventually digesting that knowledge.
 
Thus, I see nothing wrong in quoting a great saint or a yogi, as opposed to writing one's own thoughts.
 
I started this list to share my thoughts on various spiritual matters. Based on my own experiences, I could finally make sense of various seemingly contradictory things I had read. I could put it all together in my mind and have a uniform, consistent, coherent and integrated understanding that put various things in the correct perspective. I wanted to promote such a wholesome and integrated understanding and do my part in "bridging" various "islands" of spiritual wisdom that exist out there. The other goal of this forum is to remove some fundamental confusions and misunderstandings that may be blocking some people from doing spiritual sadhana and making spiritual progress and encourage some people to do spiritual sadhana.
 
If words of a great yogi or saint that promote the same goal are shared, I see nothing wrong in it. The only thing is I request people to go a bit slow and not post too many such mails on the same day. Some people may be overwhelmed by the traffic and just delete the mails. One can slowly cover the ground one wants to cover, over a period of time. So please limit such posts.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

It would be more helpful if one adds one's opinion which could blossom into a positive discussion and a learning opportunity. After all, they might as well provide the web url or the book name and we could always buy it or read it online. If people take the contents directly from the web and paste it here, then I would strongly discourage this kind of posts. However, if they have painstakingly typed up the matter from books, then I don't have the heart to ask them to stop it.

People should realize, in the internet/email medium, using upper-case, bold. italics have a different meaning especially if one wants to strongly emphasize a point. What's the point of writing the entire article in the same manner??

Otherwise, each member may soon start posting verbatim from their favorite books or websites or gurus or philosophies and with such 'daily spam' there would not be many posts meant for reading/discussion. It is one thing to quote a relevant passage from a book or url or Master on a currently running topic and another to post along the recent patterns. One can always start a discussion sharing a piece of writing or speech by any Master/Book and open it to the forum for discussing issues, problems or clarifications by raising them explicitly along with the relevant material. If other members share my feeling on this then we can request the moderator to act accordingly.
