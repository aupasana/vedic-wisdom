Namaste,
 
Kaalabhairava Jayanti is on Maargasira Krishna Ashtami, which falls on Dec 28 this year (and not November 28 as mentioned below). Of course, Krishna paksha Ashtami day in all months is auspicious for worshipping Kaala Bhairava. But this one is special.
 
Regarding Yantras (in general):
 
Just as containers of different shapes are optimal for storing different materials, similarly different yantras are optimal for storing spiritual energy of different kinds. However, please note that someone has to get milk and pour it in a container, for a container designed for milk to have milk in it! Similarly, someone has to do enough sadhana using a yantra to store some spiritual shakti in it. One usually cannot expect to buy a yantra that is already charged with spiritual energy.
 
Regarding havan:
 
A detailed manual of "Kaala Bhairava Homam" can be downloaded at the homam website (see link below in my signature). Using it, anybody can perform a homam by oneself. Many common questions are addressed within the manual.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
