Namaste,
=C2=A0
Some more queries came up while thinking a=
bout the idol worship etc.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Suppose a foolish person thought w=
hile praying to an idol everyday of a fierce goddess who kills all of one's=
 enemies, brings people under one's control=C2=A0and makes one successful. =
Suppose you focus on that idol. 
=C2=A0
1) My question is, so eventually so=
me thoughts/emotions of the worshipper gets lodged in the idol, both positi=
ve and negative. What is the relevance of doing a pranpratistha in an idol?=
 Will not the ritual of pranpratistha bring the energy of the deity into th=
e idol? If it does, then how can the emotions/thoughts of the worshipper ge=
t lodged in the idol since it already contains the energy of the deity?
=C2=
=A0
Or does it mean that the energy/emotions of the worshipper get lodged i=
n an idol where the pranpratistha ritual has been incorrectly/ incompletely=
 done, which happens so often in the case of idols at home.
=C2=A0
2) What =
is the relevance of the Sanskrit language in pranpratistha ritual.=C2=A0 Or=
 rather, the significance of Sanskrit when it comes to spirituality in gene=
ral. If the pranpratistha mantras/slokas are translated into some other lan=
guage and used, will it be equally potent, assuming that spiritual power of=
 the person doing the prasnpratistha to be a constant?
=C2=A0
I mean, let u=
s leave aside the case of a Ramakrishna doing a pranpratistha of an idol be=
cause someone like Him does not need language to call the deity into an ido=
l. But for others, how important is Sanskrit?

=C2=A0
=C2=A0Let us not be harsh in judging pe=

=C2=A0
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
While wha=

 figures from history based on incontrovertible evidence. And I don't mean =
the actions of their followers but the very own lives of these people as re=

=C2=A0
Thakur Sri Ramakrishna had once tol=

 about people who claim to be spiritual. 
=C2=A0

Dear Rajarshi,
=C2=A0
Before I answer y=
our main question, I want to address the following:
=C2=A0
> Interestingly,=
 even that spiritual=C2=A0person=C2=A0told him that there is probably
> no =
divine presence inside the idol at Kaalighat temple.
> 
> Now my question i=
s, if the idol at the Kaalighat temple did not have a divine

 did=C2=A0this person=C2=A0suddenly have such a nice meditation there?
=C2=
=A0
Two points:
=C2=A0
(1) One can have a nice meditation session anywhere.=
 While different places and times have some difference in the nature and de=
gree of spiritual energy, one can experience anything anywhere anytime, if =
the internal factors are conducive.
=C2=A0
(2)=C2=A0What I said about Daksh=
ineshwar vs Kalighat is purely my observation. Please bear in mind that any=
 observation is fallible! It is possible that Kalighat has similar or highe=
r spiritual energy compared to Dakshineshwar and I simply failed to perceiv=
e it. What we are able to perceive and observe is also based on our own men=
tal conditioning and our own karmik debts. The Mother is capable of deludin=
g *anyone*.
=C2=A0
> But then, what ever the idol may contain, postive/nega=
tive/ creative/
> destruction, if someone prays to it with devotion, assumi=
ng that it is
> reaching God, is it=C2=A0not enough?
=C2=A0
The purpose of =
an=C2=A0idol is to evoke certain imagery or thought in you. If a spiritual =
person imagines a particular energy or form of god in a particular object o=
n a continuous basis, slowly that form gets "established" in that idol. As =
time goes on, his mind=C2=A0can be focused on that specific form faster and=
 easier by simply looking at the idol. Though we think that our minds are s=
eparate entities, they are all connected feebly and all of us are able to p=
erceive in some vague form other people's strong thoughts that are present =
in the ether. Thus, if an idol is working as a repository of several spirit=
ual thoughts of a person trying to focus on a form of god, seeing that idol=
 can evoke some similar thoughts in another person too.
=C2=A0
However, the=
re is some translation involved when thoughts of one mind are vaguely perce=
ived and interpreted by another mind. This translation is dependent on one'=
s mental conditioning. Thus, what we perceive at the end is conformant to o=
ur own mental conditioning!
=C2=A0
Suppose a foolish person thought while p=
raying to an idol everyday of a fierce goddess who kills all of one's enemi=
es, brings people under one's control=C2=A0and makes one successful. Suppos=
e you focus on that idol. Then you are susceptible to that kind of thoughts=
. However, if you see her as someone who helps you overcome your weaknesses=
 and become dispassionate, nothing bad is going to happen to you. But the f=
act that someone used that idol as a repository of negative thoughts become=
s a minor obstruction.
=C2=A0
However, please note that this principle work=
s without an idol too. Suppose someone goes to a particular place (e.g. a c=
hurch bench) and prays to god with certain desires/thoughts everyday. Those=
 thoughts are present in the air there. Anyone praying there later may be a=
 little susceptible to such thoughts. The concentration of thoughts may be =
a=C2=A0little higher when an idol serves as a repository as opposed to just=
 air. That's all.
=C2=A0
However, please note that most people have some de=
votion, some surrender, some love and some fear of wrong-doing when they ar=
e praying to god, within or without an idol. Thus, any negative and selfish=
 thoughts are also accompanied by a lot of desirable thoughts. Thus, the do=
wnside I mentioned is not a big deal. This downside becomes considerable on=
ly in rare cases of really taamasik sadhakas indulging in terrible practice=
s without understanding what they are doing.
=C2=A0

?
=C2=A0
Bottomline is that I do not see any risk in idol worship.

=C2=A0
God=

man needs to recreate god in his mind and fill the mind with god, so that h=
e can go back to the source and become free from this cycle. But, due to th=
e corruptions/ conditioning of the mind, he is not able to create god corre=
ctly. He ends up creating god as a replica of his current corrupt state! Th=
e goal is to keep creating god in mind and keep refining him and hence keep=
 refining oneself and eventually become pure. When one is pure and creates =
god as a replica of oneself, that god will match the god that created man i=
n the first place. When that god fills one's mind, one is free from the cyc=
le.

In =

=C2=A0
>From time to t=
ime, the Lord may send someone to a part of the world to maintain the corre=

 at that time. One cannot judge a yogi or spiritual teacher based on how ma=

 something. Let us not be harsh in judging people we have not met physicall=

=C2=A0

Namaste,
=C2=A0
To add to my query,=C2=A0a good number of=C2=
=A0religions explicitly prohibit idol worship. If the underlying truth is o=
ne, how can it be so contradictory? 
=C2=A0
I can understand that a Idol ma=
y contain a presence created by human imagination which maynot have a divin=
e link. Not everybody is a Ramakrishna who can actually call Mahakali into =
an Idol.
=C2=A0
But then, what ever the idol may contain, postive/negative/=
 creative/ destruction, if someone prays to it with devotion, assuming that=
 it is reaching God, is it=C2=A0not enough? After all God is finally tax co=
llecter of prayers. Does not all prayer finally reach God, irrespective of =
whether a divine presence is there or not there infront?

If an incense stick with intense smell was burnt in a =

Similarly, when a great saint meditates in a place, the air there=

It is my humble opinion that some famous temples do not =
have much divine presence today, though I do not want to name any names. At=
 the same time, some not-so-well- known temples seem to have a powerful div=
ine presence.
=C2=A0
I was very impressed with the=C2=A0Krishna temple in M=
ayapur (ISKCON head office is there), Girnar hills in Gujarat and Arunachal=
am hills in Tiruvannamalai (Ramana Maharshi's place). There is a tremendous=
 amount of spiritual energy in those places. There are several temples wher=
e the idol is practically alive. For example, even 123 years after Ramakris=
hna Paramahamsa left, the Kaali idol at Dakshineshwar is "alive". I did not=
 get the same impression at the famous Kalighat temple which is also in Cal=
cutta.
=C2=A0
There was one small temple in Tamil Nadu that I was taken to =
by a priest who took me to visit about 30 temples all over Tamil Nadu befor=
e we did the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 2006. I never heard of that t=
emple before and it seemed like a small temple. The name of the=C2=A0form o=
f the divine Mother=C2=A0present there was a Tamil language name and I did =
not understand it. I do not even remember the name now. But, when I closed =
my eyes and started meditating with my mantra in front of the idol, I was d=
azzled by a vision of a very fierce goddess whose face was emiting rays lik=
e Sun. I felt that there was a powerful presence there. Unfortunately, I do=
 not remember the name of the place or the goddess, but it is a temple with=
out roof over the goddess. They tried to put a roof over the goddess a few =
times, but the roof came down in a fire accident each time and they finally=
 decided that the goddess likes open air and no roof. Though we spent only =
5 min and left
 in a hurry, I was very pleased with that temple. Someone fr=
om Tamil Nadu probably knows the name of the temple and goddess.
=C2=A0
Lik=
e this, I am sure there are many temples with a powerful divine presence ac=
ross India.
=C2=A0
Apart from the Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar, one of my =
best experiences when meditating was at the Krishna/Vitthal temple at Aalan=
di near Pune. I am sure that Jnaneshwar Maharaj is still meditating in the =
underground chamber there.
=C2=A0

=C2=A0
Even the middle of=
 a busy road in India is better for meditating than a temple in USA. These =
western countries are so filled with rajas and tamas. There is rajas in Ind=
ia too, but there is a good amount of sattwa there. Thus, any temple in Ind=
ia will be a good place to meditate, but my view is that there is not much =
left at *some* temples. But some temples are really good.
=C2=A0
If one has=
 a chance to spend a few months doing spiritual sadhana near a temple, I su=
ggest the following:
=C2=A0
Mayapur, Dakshineshwar, Puri and Kamakhya in ea=
st India, Kurtaalam, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam hills)=C2=A0and Narayana=
=C2=A0vanam (near Tirupati)=C2=A0in south India, Shirdi, Aalandi, Dwaraka=
=C2=A0and Girnar mountains (Junagadh) in west India, Varanasi, Vrindavan an=
d Hrishikesh in north India and Srisailam and Mantralayam=C2=A0and Ujjain i=
n central India.
=C2=A0
There are many other good places, but the above com=
e to my mind. Visiting a temple once is one thing and staying there for sev=
eral months while maintaining a simple lifestyle and doing a spiritual sadh=
ana (like homam or japam) there is quite another.

<DIV><BR>Namaste,</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Some more queries =
came up while thinking about the idol worship etc.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
=
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV><EM>Suppose a foolish person thought while praying t=
o an idol everyday of a fierce goddess who kills all of one's enemies, brin=
gs people under one's control and makes one successful. Suppose you fo=
cus on that idol. </EM></DIV>
<DIV><EM></EM> </DIV>
<DIV>1) My questio=
n is, so eventually some thoughts/emotions of the worshipper gets lodged in=
 the idol, both positive and negative. What is the relevance of doing a pra=
npratistha in an idol? Will not the ritual of pranpratistha bring the energ=
y of the deity into the idol? If it does, then how can the emotions/thought=
s of the worshipper get lodged in the idol since it already contains the en=
ergy of the deity?</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Or does it mean that the en=
ergy/emotions of the worshipper get lodged in an idol where the pranpratist=
ha ritual has been incorrectly/ incompletely done, which happens so often i=
n the case of idols at home.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>2) What is the re=
levance of the Sanskrit language in pranpratistha ritual.  Or rather, =
the significance of Sanskrit when it comes to spirituality in general. If t=
he pranpratistha mantras/slokas are translated into some other language and=
 used, will it be equally potent, assuming that spiritual power of the pers=
on doing the prasnpratistha to be a constant?</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>=
I mean, let us leave aside the case of a Ramakrishna doing a pranpratistha =
of an idol because someone like Him does not need language to call the deit=
y into an idol. But for others, how important is Sanskrit?</DIV>

<DIV><EM></EM> </DIV>
<DIV>On a different issue about judging&nbs=
p;so called holy men from history - a deviation - I would like to=
 make one point. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV><EM> =
Let us not be harsh in judging people we have not met physically or otherwi=
se</EM></DIV>
<DIV><EM></EM> </DIV>
<DIV><EM></EM> </DIV>
<DIV>&n=
bsp;</DIV>
<DIV>While what you say is correct, there can always be some rat=
ional judgement passed on figures from history based on incontrovertible ev=
idence. And I don't mean the actions of their followers but the very own li=
ves of these people as recorded by their contemporaries. </DIV>
<DIV> =
</DIV>
<DIV>Thakur Sri Ramakrishna had once told one of his disciples that =
always judge a holy man not just by his words but by his conduct as well. T=
hat is really the BEST way to form some opinion about people who claim to b=
e spiritual. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Therefore, if a historicall=
y authentic biography of a spiritual person is read and compared with stand=
ard models of spirtuality/ spiritual life along with the words/saying =
of the person, one can make a fair judgement. It is using these tools =
that one can very easily question the spiritual realizations of some s=
o called prophets in history. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>If the seed is =
questionable, the fruits are bound to be rotten.</DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2> </FONT></D=
IV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>The purpose of an idol is to evok=
e certain imagery or thought in you. If a spiritual person imagines a parti=
cular energy or form of god in a particular object on a continuous basis, s=
lowly that form gets "established" in that idol. As time goes on, his mind&=
nbsp;can be focused on that specific form faster and easier by simply looki=
ng at the idol. Though we think that our minds are separate entities, they =
are all connected feebly and all of us are able to perceive in some vague f=
orm other people's strong thoughts that are present in the ether. Thus, if =
an idol is working as a repository of several spiritual thoughts of a perso=
n trying to focus on a form of god, seeing that idol can evoke some similar=
 thoughts in another person too.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=
=3D2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>However, there is=
 some translation involved when thoughts of one mind are vaguely perceived =
and interpreted by another mind. This translation is dependent on one's men=
tal conditioning. Thus, what we perceive at the end is conformant to our ow=
n mental conditioning!</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2> =
</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Suppose a foolish person tho=
ught while praying to an idol everyday of a fierce goddess who kills all of=
 one's enemies, brings people under one's control and makes one succes=
sful. Suppose you focus on that idol. Then you are susceptible to that kind=
 of thoughts. However, if you see her as someone who helps you overcome you=
r weaknesses and become dispassionate, nothing bad is going to happen to yo=
u. But the fact that someone used that idol as a repository of negative tho=
ughts becomes a minor obstruction.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial siz=
e=3D2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>However, please =
note that this principle works without an idol too. Suppose someone goes to=
 a particular place (e.g. a church bench) and prays to god with certain des=
ires/thoughts everyday. Those thoughts are present in the air there. Anyone=
 praying there later may be a little susceptible to such thoughts. The conc=
entration of thoughts may be a little higher when an idol serves as a =
repository as opposed to just air. That's all.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=
=3DArial size=3D2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Howe=
ver, please note that most people have some devotion, some surrender, some =
love and some fear of wrong-doing when they are praying to god, within or w=
ithout an idol. Thus, any negative and selfish thoughts are also accompanie=
d by a lot of desirable thoughts. Thus, the downside I mentioned is not a b=

<DIV>Namaste,</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>To add to my query, a good =
number of religions explicitly prohibit idol worship. If the underlyin=
g truth is one, how can it be so contradictory? </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<D=
IV>I can understand that a Idol may contain a presence created by human ima=
gination which maynot have a divine link. Not everybody is a Ramakrishna wh=
o can actually call Mahakali into an Idol.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>But=
 then, what ever the idol may contain, postive/negative/ creative/ destruct=
ion, if someone prays to it with devotion, assuming that it is reaching God=
, is it not enough? After all God is finally tax collecter of prayers.=
 Does not all prayer finally reach God, irrespective of whether a divine pr=
esence is there or not there infront?</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D=
2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>I would like to mention a small incident here ab=
out someone I know well. There was a certain individual, who when=
ever he would go to Calcutta. he would take time out to go a=
nd meditate in the hall infornt of the idol at the Kaalighat temple. O=
nce he reached the temple around 8 pm and sat there trying to med=
iate for about 2 hours. His mind suddenly became very focused, he=
 *thought* he saw some deep blue lights (probably just his imagin=
ation) - but there was a distinct feeling of great joy in him. His&nbs=
p;mind become without thoughts as if there was no worry in the whole world,=
 everything was perfect.  Also a strong, sanguine feeling came into hi=
m that he needed to worship the Goddess. As he came out he f=
ound that his shoes were missing, so he walked more than a kilome=
ter distance bare feet though an extremely dirty road but all he =
felt was a deep
 joy. Nothing was actually registering in his mind tha=
t night, except for an overwhelming joy, as he said later on. Bottomli=
ne: a nice spiritual experience.</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></F=
ONT> </DIV>
<DIV>Some months later he ended up meeting =
a very spiritual person who instructed him about worshipping the Goddess.&n=
bsp; He strongly believes that night at the temple and his meeting wit=
h the person was related. Interestingly, even that spiritual person&nb=
sp;told him that there is probably no divine presence inside the idol at Ka=
alighat temple.</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT><FONT face=3D=
Arial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>Now my question is, if the idol at =
the Kaalighat temple did not have a divine presence why did this perso=
n suddenly have such a nice meditation there?  Does it =
mean that finally it is only the devotion of the devotee which counts =
for spiritual energy inside a temple, irrespective of whether the idol has =
any energy at all?</DIV>

namalai (Ramana Maharshi's place). There is a tremendous amount of spiritua=
l energy in those places. There are several temples where the idol is pract=
ically alive. For example, even 123 years after Ramakrishna Paramahamsa lef=
t, the Kaali idol at Dakshineshwar is "alive". I did not get the same impre=
ssion at the famous Kalighat temple which is also in Calcutta.</FONT></DIV>=

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DAri=

 a priest who took me to visit about 30 temples all over Tamil Nadu before =
we did the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 2006. I never heard of that tem=
ple before and it seemed like a small temple. The name of the form of =
the divine Mother present there was a Tamil language name and I did no=
t understand it. I do not even remember the name now. But, when I closed my=
 eyes and started meditating with my mantra in front of the idol, I was daz=
zled by a vision of a very fierce goddess whose face was emiting rays like =
Sun. I felt that there was a powerful presence there. Unfortunately, I do n=
ot remember the name of the place or the goddess, but it is a temple withou=
t roof over the goddess. They tried to put a roof over the goddess a few ti=
mes, but the roof came down in a fire accident each time and they finally d=
ecided that the goddess likes open air and no roof.
 Though we spent only 5=
 min and left in a hurry, I was very pleased with that temple. Someone from=
 Tamil Nadu probably knows the name of the temple and goddess.</FONT></DIV>=

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Even the middle of a busy ro=
ad in India is better for meditating than a temple in USA. These western co=
untries are so filled with rajas and tamas. There is rajas in India too, bu=
t there is a good amount of sattwa there. Thus, any temple in India will be=
 a good place to meditate, but my view is that there is not much left at *s=
ome* temples. But some temples are really good.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>If =
one has a chance to spend a few months doing spiritual sadhana near a templ=
e, I suggest the following:</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2><=
/FONT> </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Mayapur, Dakshineshwar,=
 Puri and Kamakhya in east India, Kurtaalam, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam hi=
lls) and Narayana vanam (near Tirupati) in south India, Shir=
di, Aalandi, Dwaraka and Girnar mountains (Junagadh) in west India, Va=
ranasi, Vrindavan and Hrishikesh in north India and Srisailam and Mantralay=
am and Ujjain in central India.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial s=

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>There are many=
 other good places, but the above come to my mind. Visiting a temple once i=
s one thing and staying there for several months while maintaining a simple=
 lifestyle and doing a spiritual sadhana (like homam or japam) there is qui=
te another.</FONT></DIV>
