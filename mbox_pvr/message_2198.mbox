Dear Utpal,
 
This is what it takes me approximately in a one-hour Chandi h=
omam:
 
Initial things, poorvaangam, panchopachara pooja and just 12 aahuti=
s to ganapathi in fire: 5 min
Invoking Devi, panchopachara pooja, one aahut=
i to parivara devatas and moola mantra 18 times: 4 min
13 chapters: 45 min
=
Moola mantra 18 times again, naivedyam, neeraajanam, short uttarangam: 5 mi=
n
 
Moola mantra above includes moolamantra nyasa, but not saptashati nyasa=
 (khadgini sulini etc).
 
If I add kavacha, argala, keelaka, saptashti nyas=
a, ratri sooktam, devi sooktam, separate aahutis to all individual parivaar=
a devatas, doing moola mantra 108 times at the beginning and the end, then =
it takes longer, but still about 1 hr 30 min
 
Actually, even if one adds i=
nvocation of Ganapathi in an idol and Varuna in kalasha before the main hom=
am and separate panchopachara poojas to both (the steps vighneswara pooja a=
nd kalasha suddhi in short manual are replacements for them), including Pun=
yahavaachanam (pavamaana sooktam) for Varuna, it still adds another 10-15 m=
in only. If one adds balis to 10 devis (Kaatyaayani etc) and 10 bhairavas r=
epresenting the 10 directions, in addition to the standard bali given in al=
l homas, it adds another 5-10 min only.
 
Thus, a very detailed Chandi homa=
m can be performed within 2 hr if one is comfortable with the mantras and p=
rocedure. However, it can take 3-4 hrs even with a very short procedure at =
the beginning and one has to keep practicing.
 
As Narayan said, it first t=
ook him 4 hrs and now it is in 1 to 1:15 hr range. Practice makes it smooth=
.
 
If one has wood burning with a big fire and if everything thrown there =
automatically burns, fire management does not take up one's time. If one ha=
s to actively manage the fire to ensure things burn, that can add upto a 10=
 min of overhead.
 
Thanks,
Narasimha
