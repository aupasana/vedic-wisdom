Namaste friends,
 
That is correct. You can pronounce it in two ways:
 
(1)=
 "bandhanaanmrityormuksheeya" as one word without any pauses/gaps between b=
andhanaan and mrityo.
(2) "bandhanaat (small gap/pause) mrityormuksheeya" a=
s broken into two words.
 
If you can manage (1), it is the best. If you ca=
nnot, go for (2). But do NOT pronounce it as "bandhanaan (small gap/pause) =
mrityormuksheeya".
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

  Namaste,

  It is a "sandhi" that occurs there.

  ......... urva=
arukamiva bandhanaat + mrutyoH + .........................

  In this case,=
 you pronounce the word as bandhanaan since the 'm' syllable follows 't' sy=
llable.

  Namaste,

  for long it has been a most favourite mantra for me. =
Whenever i 
  found somebody struggeling with life & death, i have used thi=
s 
  mantra. I know 2 specific cases for whom i recited this mantra, one 
 =
 was a cancer patient and other was in very critical condition due to 
  gr=
ave bike-truck accident. i am happy to note that both are alive. 
  (its no=
t that because of my recitation-; )
  i've a faith in this mantra and insti=
nctively recite when somebody 
  is in serious physical trouble.

  I recit=
e "bandhanaat" -

  By the way, shri Sanjay rath has given a meaning in his=
 book on 
  vedic remedies.

  wish you all a very happy Ramkrishna Birth d=
ay (english date wise)

  Warm Regards,

  Utpal
