Namaste,

I don't know if it signifies anything. Sensation of pressure or tightness 
lightness or heat or coldness or tingling may occur in any body parts 
(usually in the main torso) when one is in meditation. It is a sign praana 
vaayu flowing some nadis and doing some cleanup. It is better to not worry 
about it and just focus on the meditation.

Of course, it can also be a mere physical thing and suggest some other 
physical problem. For example, your meditation posture may be putting 
pressure on a leg or hand. So observe it for some time and seek help if 
needed.

But you are saying that it happens only during meditation. Just verify that 
your posture is not putting pressure on it.

Best regards,
Narasimha
