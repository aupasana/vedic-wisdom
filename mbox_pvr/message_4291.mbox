Namaste friends,
 
If you go to the homam website below, you will now see Hanuman homam manuals also. It gives a few options for the main homam, including some simple verses and the powerful 12-name stotra of Hanuman. Also included are Hanuman Chalisa composed by Tulsidas in Hindi language and Bheemarupi Hanuman stotra composed by Sadguru Samartha Ramadas in Marathi language. Though these two prayers are not in Sanskrit, these words came from realized men who had Hanuman's darshana (direct vision) in not-so-distant past (relatively) and hence their compositions have some power in them.
 
The following words are reproduced from the manual.
 
--------------------
Why Hanuman Homam
 
Lord Hanuman is an avatara of Shiva and he has the essence of eleven Rudras in him. He is the greatest devotee of Lord Rama. He is the most perfected master of jnaana yoga, bhakti yoga, karma yoga and raja yoga. He learned Veda and aatma jnaana directly from Lord Sun (universal soul). He is an epitome of knowledge, bravery, devotion and daasa bhaava (spirit of a servant).
 
Worship of Lord Hanuman can give knowledge, energy, bravery, physical strength, success over enemies, good health, humility, devotion and aatma jnaana (knowledge of Self), depending on the aptitude and attitude of the worshipper. It can also give relief from problems given by planets, especially Saturn and Mars.
--------------------
 
It is important that different people are doing homam to different deities in today's world. For a perfect balance in the world, we need people to be worshipping Ganapathi, Vishnu, Lakshmi, Shiva, Krishna, Hanuman, Narasimha, Chandi, Bhairava etc in fire. We will continue to upload more manuals. We hope some people attached to Hanuman will perform Hanuman homam on a regular basis.
 
Thanks to Ravi Poruri, who did all the typing for these manuals!
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
