>> A Note on the Eclipses in July-Aug 2009
>>
>>
>> The occurrence of three consecutive eclipses - a lunar eclipse on 2009 
>> July 7, a solar eclipse on 2009 July 22 and another lunar eclipse on 2009 
>> August 6 - has generated a lot of interest. Especially the solar eclipse 
>> of July 22 occurs when Sun is in the 6th degree of Cancer, which is Sun's 
>> Mrityu Bhaga (death inflicting degree) in Cancer. When the eclipse starts 
>> in New Delhi, Sun, Moon, Ketu and ascendant are in the same rasi and 
>> navamsa. Hence, this can be a problematic eclipse.
>>
>>
>> Eclipse time is a very favorable time for spiritual sadhana, though 
>> temple rituals are halted during eclipses. There is a reason for it.
>>
>>
>> Sun and Moon are the eyes of Parama Purusha (the supreme cosmic being). 
>> Microcosmically, individual soul (Sun) and individual mind (Moon) are the 
>> eyes through which we see the dual world around us. If individual soul 
>> and individual mind stop seeing, one no longer experiences any objects in 
>> the field of duality. The objectification within Brahman ceases and one 
>> is established in Brahman, i.e. non-dual nirvikalpa samadhi. In other 
>> words, one realizes Self.
>>
>>
>> To fulfil one's dharma as an individual in the field of duality, one 
>> needs to be awake to the duality. One needs the individualized 
>> consciousness represented by Sun and Moon. Hence eclipse time when Sun or 
>> Moon is blocked is unfavorable for dharmik activities. Temples and temple 
>> rituals, which are performed for collective dharma of society, are 
>> understandably halted. However, it is a great time for spiritual sadhana 
>> for self-realization. This applies to homam as well. If one performs 
>> homam for material benefits, one should stop during an eclipse. However, 
>> if one performs homam for spiritual progress and self-realization, a 
>> homam performed during an eclipse is much more powerful than at other 
>> times. One can perform homam to any deity during an eclipse, though homam 
>> to an ugra devata may work better.
