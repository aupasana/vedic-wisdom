Namaste,
 
It really depends on the person and his/her karmas.
 
In general=
, after a few months of daily homam, some inner transformation should occur=
 in the way the person views self, others and life. Some clarity should com=
e. Mind should be more peaceful and calm (even when engaging in actions tha=
t usually spoil mental calmness). Even when mental calmness is disturbed te=
mporarily, it should be rstored fast. The impermanence of most things we cl=
ing on to should be more obvious than before. Devotion should increase.
 
S=
pecific experiences can vary. If one is ready, meditation at the end of hom=
am can even make Kundalini rise, but that may need more preparation in most=
. Some level of prior inner transformation is needed before that.
 
The goa=
l of homam or any other sadhana is inner transformation.
 
In addition, som=
e specific results are possible with different kind of homas. One doing Sav=
itri Gayatri homam regularly may experience a sharper intellect and the abi=
lity to see things related to knowledge more clearly. One doing Chandi homa=
m regularly may experience fearlessness, boldness, frankness, detachment an=
d the ability to wage a big battle without much attachment. One doing Sri K=
rishna homam regularly may melt with devotion and start to internally cry f=
or Krishna. Different homas may work in different ways. But they all cause =
internal transformation, simplify the ego of the person, purify the system =
and clarify thinking.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

  Dear Narasmiha

        I was wondering, does doing homa for different de=
ities have different kind of effects. Like if someone does a Mahaganapati H=
oma vs someone doing a Homa of Krishna for a considerable period of time, i=
s there any set principle that defines what kind of progress or experiences=
 each may undergo?

        I know that it may all depend on the specific p=
ersons karmas and mental makeup acquired over many lifetimes, but can there=
 be a broad generalization done on this?

        -Regards
         Rajarsh=

          Namaste,

         =
 It is far better to stick to one deity and one homam and do it every 
    =
      day/week/fortnight/ month for a duration of time. It is a bad idea to=
 do a 
          different homam everyday.

          Ramakrishna Paramaham=
sa used to say "if you want, dig deep in one place. 
          Don't dig on=
e foot in one place, another foot in another place and so on".

          P=
ick one deity and one homam and do it continuously for a few months 
      =
    atleast. It will do something then.

          Amavasya is good for wor=
shipping Kaali or Mahalakshmi. Especially 
          Deepavali/Diwali is a =
great day to worship Mahalakshmi. So Her homam is a 
          good idea.
