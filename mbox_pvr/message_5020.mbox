Namaste Mahesh ji,
 
Ideal time for any sadhana, including homam and tarpana, is early in the morning, around the sunrise time. Traditionally, daily morning rituals of learned brahmanas would consist of offering arghya to Sun, offering tarpana to devas, rishis and pitris (ancestral manes), meditation and a fire ritual.
 
As for bowing, one can bow to god present in every object before using an object. Learned ones bow to food and express respect/gratitude to it before eating it. Some do pooja to homa kundam, to ghee bowl and to the wooden spoons used for offering ghee, before the actual homam. Like this, one can bow (or mentally bow) and have an attitude of reverence, respect and gratitude for any object/person that one uses or interacts with. This is conducive to oneday truly realizing the divinity in all. Of course, the key is not the physical act of bowing, but the mental act of feeling reverence and gratitude.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
