Dear Lakshmi,

You made very good points. Nice quote from Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.

I want to say more on one statement:

> When a person thinks he is so pure that the Lord talks
> to him personally,and that they are a direct vehicle
> to serve the Lord.
> that is good indication the person is suffering from a
> certain level of delusion/maya.

That is a good indication but not a conclusive proof.

Someone like Ramakrishna Paramahamsa may mention many times that Kali told 
him this or Kali told him that. At a casual observation, he may seem like a 
proud person suffering from delusion. But he may have no such pride.

Similarly, someone else may talk very humbly and very sweetly. But all that 
may be a facade. The person may be internally quite proud of his purity and 
even proud of how humble and saattwik he thinks he is. At a casual 
observation, he may seem like a very humble and saattwik person. But he may 
not be.

Let me give a simple analogy. One who watches a movie and narrates its story 
to another person is not necessarily deluded by the movie. He may have 
watched the movie impassionately and be simply narrating the story to one 
who is curious. On the contrary, someone else may claim "oh, it's just a 
movie. It's not real. Don't take it seriously" and yet secretly feel 
excitement in some scenes, fear in some scenes and sadness in some scenes 
etc.

One's detachment and one's ego cannot be judged from one or two actions. 
Only a careful observation over a period of time can reveal what motivates 
one, what one's agenda is, how one thinks and potentially give clues 
regarding one's purity level. Actually, even after a long observation, one 
may not be able to judge others. The best thing is not to judge the 
spiritual purity of others.

As I said before, we should focus internally. Each of us can analyze our own 
mind and its motivations. We should try to weed out pride from our actions, 
thoughts and instincts. Irrespective how we appear to the world and what 
others think about is, each of us should be able to recognize pride with 
some conscious intrpspection. We know what is going on in our mind.

Best regards,
Narasimha
