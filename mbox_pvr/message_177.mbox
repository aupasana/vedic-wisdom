Dear Ramadas ji,
 
Thank you for your comments and I will give some quick r=
eplies.
 
> But my intention is when we do some traditional Yajnas like thi=
s,
 
What is taught in the manual is *not* a "traditional Yajna". Though we=
 sometimes use the words yajna and homa exchangably, they are quite differe=
nt. A yajna is bigger in scale, has many many strict rules and is performed=
 to achieve some specific goals and performed only occasionally. A homa can=
 be big or small, more flexible with rules and can be performed as a spirit=
ual sadhana on a daily or weekly basis.
 
My manual is only for those who w=
ant *internal* purification and upliftment in the presence of a god in live=
 external fire every morning. If someone has specific *external* goals (e.g=
. getting control over a person, defeating an enemy, killing a person, achi=
eving wealth, getting a child etc), it is doable but a lot of rules are imp=
osed on the procedure and it is not easy to learn. I am *not* serving such =
people with the manual.
 
> we should follow the methods given in the origi=
nal Homa procedure.
 
Well, there isn't really any single "original Homa pr=
ocedure". There is a set of several procedures that are used in several tra=
ditions for several purposes. All procedures given when there are specific =
tasks involved have some complications and inappropriate to spread on the i=
nternet.
 
However, there are some simple homam procedures used in the past=
 as a *daily spiritual sadhana* and the "short" procedure in the manual is =
one of them.
 
> Fire or Agni is pure.
 
And, Agni is *not* to be feared. A=
gni is to be loved, as he can be used as a medium for invoking divine prese=
nce to purify oneself.
 
Neither Agni nor the god in Agni is to be feared. =
If one is asking for a specific external goal, one better be prepared for p=
unishment when something is messed up. But, when one only loves god and Agn=
i and only wants to purify oneself in god's presence in Agni, I declare wit=
h confidence that there is *nothing* to fear. Any homam procedure one uses =
from the manual or elsewhere will only help one in that case.
 
> I am clos=
ing this discussion.
 
Thank you for bringing up some points which enabled =
me to write things that I did not get a chance to write before. It is the c=
omments from people like you that enable me to refine the "explanation" par=
t of the manual and answer more concerns of people! It is the kindness of M=
other that there are friendly critics helping me to refine the document and=
 thereby serve more people.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
