When god comes to earth to e=
stablish some measure of dharma, he is bound by the limitations of the time=
 and the place where he comes. Even god has to obey some limits of desa-kaa=
la-paatra and that limits the amount of knowledge he can leave. Moreover, t=
he knowledge left by god (or a god-realized person) can slowly become corru=
pted by generations of followers who have a lower level of understanding. A=
 point will come when the knowledge is too corrupted to be useful anymore.
=
 
Words are just words. They have no absolute meaning. Based on our life ex=
periences, different words and sequences of words evoke different thoughts =
in our mind. The process of transmitting one's thoughts to another person u=
sing written words as a medium is imperfect, especially when two people are=
 separated by different times, cultures and thinking styles. Thus, as time =
passes on, the thoughts evoked by the same set of words may change. What Je=
sus or his disciples had in mind when Biblical texts were spoken 2000 years=
 back and how people understand those texts today can be significantly diff=
erent. Religions and people's understanding become stale with time. Then go=
d will have to find an appropriate time and come back or send somebody agai=
n.
 
Even though conflicts between some religions have created strife for s=
everal people (and even some killings), it is still better than no relgion.=
 However imperfect, those religions ensured that some minimum level of dhar=
ma was maintained in the world. Without those religions, life may have been=
 more chaotic in some parts of the world.
 
There is one more thing. There =
are different gunas in this world. People with too much of tamas and rajas,=
 even when they come in contact with sattwa, cannot become sattwik. When su=
ch people get involved in a religion or take charge, they corrupt it and en=
gage in unfortunate acts in the name of religion. Really sattwik people in =
all religions co-exist peacefully and practice their faith. It is the peopl=
e with tamas and rajas who create strife. God cannot do anything about it.
=
 
God acts through us. He either has to come down to earth to fix things or=
 he uses us to do it. For him to come down, adharma has to cross some thres=
hhold.
 
When we say that god does everything in the world, we are taking a=
bout non-duality. The One Supreme Cosmic Being is the sum of all of us and =
he does all that all of us do. But, at the level of non-duality, there is n=
o good and bad. The good and bad we see is at the level of duality. The god=
s who operate under the framework of duality, unlike the Supreme Cosmic Bei=
ng, are restricted in their operations. They have to obey the rules of Natu=
re. They cannot change the world as they want. They can only do what the cu=
rrent time allows. If the current time allows a lot of rajasik and tamasik =
people to control the world and if the current time does not allow god to c=
ome to earth, god will have to wait.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

  Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Multiple God=
s and Conflicts

        Namaste, 

        Scriptures and other great peop=
le who have understood the essence of these scriptures say that God is ever=
ywhere. Since human brain cannot assimilate the concept of infinity, sages =
have tried to decipher Truth by saying that avataras, prophets etc are but =
manifestations/personifications of the same Truth.

        Depending on th=
e propensities of the human beings, they have "followed" different prophets=
 and avataras and assimilated their teachings in their way of life, hoping =
that they would reach the Truth through them. 

        If this understandi=
ng is right, my question is:

        a) Why did God come on earth in diffe=
rent forms(Mohammad, Jesus, Vishnu etc)? Did God not anticipate the problem=
s of having different faiths? Or is it that He/She/IT wants us to go throug=
h these problem and overcome our weakness to realize Self/God? 

        I =
am unable to understand this cycle :

        God Creates human beings -> H=
uman beings destroy themselves due to their weakness -> God incarnates as K=
rishna to save dharma -> Followers of Krishna come to existence -> Again hu=
mans destroy eachother -> This time God incarnates as Jesus -> Followers of=
 Jesus come to existence -> Now Jesus followers and Krishna followers fight=
 with eachother -> Now God is supposed to come as Kalki to save the followe=
rs of Krishna/Jesus

        Isn't God creating confusion in already confus=
ed/weak minds of humans?

        Thanks & Regards,
        --Murahari
