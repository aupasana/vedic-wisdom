Dear Dinesh,

I arrived at the number based on shastras which say that Kali yuga is of 
432,000 years and Dwapara, Treta and Krita yuga are 2, 3 and 4 times Kali 
yuga in length.

People normally believe that there was no civilization 2 million years back. 
Just because we do not have proof of a 2 million year old civilization does 
not "prove" that there was no civilization then. Even today, a very very 
very small portion of earth is inhabited. It is very likely that an even 
smaller portion of earth was inhabited then. The odds of conducting 
excavations at the correct place to the correct depth to discover a 2 
million year old civilization are very low.

The suggestion that Rama lived just 2,500 years before Krishna is, honestly 
speaking, quite silly.

Best regards,
Narasimha
