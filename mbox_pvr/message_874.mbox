Namaste Rajarshi,
 
Happy new year to you and others too.
 
Cracking can be=
 because of air or moisture trapped in wood. Don't worry about it.
 
Offeri=
ng clothes to gods is like offering clothes to your mother and father. But =
remember one thing. If you give expensive clothes as opposed to simple clot=
hes, human beings may be happier. But gods do not care much about the value=
 placed on clothes by human beings. A simple 1 ft x 1ft cotton cloth offere=
d with devotion, sincerity and surrender may please Her much more than a 9 =
ft x 4 ft silk saree with elaborate silver embroidery work offered with pom=
p and pride. Gods do not think like normal human beings. One should offer w=
hat is reasonable based on one's finances and time and maintain a humble at=
titude of surrender.
 
A child who is proud and pompous does not impress hi=
s mother as much as an innocent child does. When you do a homam, think and =
behave like a small child who plays a game with his mother in which he feed=
s small bites of food to mother. One's mother may be big and be able to tak=
e care of herself. But she may like to play a game with the child and say "=
I am hungry my son. Can you please give me some food?" Even if the child gi=
ves very small bites, she may say "oh thank you. I am full now." Just as in=
 the allegory, we are children and gods we worship in fire (or elsewhere) a=
re parents who have everything and do not really need anything from us. Yet=
, for their pastime, they engage in a play with us. Be an innocent child in=
 that play rather than being a pompous and proud kid. We are feeding little=
 bites to playful parents who do not really need anything from us and who a=
ctually own everything that we consider ours.
 
Esoterically, clothes repre=
sent the gunas that condition us.
 
Regarding burning good and bad karmas: =
Suppose a great saint visits you and you serve him and offer him something =
nice. Suppose he blesses you. His blessings may either enhance good results=
 or decrease bad results. Both are possible. With fire and homam also, both=
 are possible. Fire may burn a bad karma and relieve you from having to exp=
erience its fruit. Fire may also receive a good karma and give its fruit im=
mediately. Fire is intelligent and you do not have to worry.
 
Best regards=
,
Narasimha

        One more question I had, the ho=
ma Agni burns away the karmas which are represented by the wood and the off=
erings we give. Now is this only the negative karmas it burns or also the o=
nce we call good karmas?


        The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhaira=
va - Shiva Sutra

  Dear Members

          Wish you all a very happy new year.

          I =
had a few questions to people who use wood for homa. Sometimes the 
       =
   wood bursts in the fire with a loud crack. Is it because of trapped 
   =
       air in teh wood? If so, is there anything that can be done to reduce=
 
          this cracking. 

          Sometimes I have seen people offerin=
g pieces of cloth in fire during 
          poornahuti. What does cloth ind=
icate?

          -Regards
          Rajarshi
