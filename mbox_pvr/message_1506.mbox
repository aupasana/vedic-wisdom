Namaste Harikishan ji,

There is absolutely nothing wrong in chanting Vishnu sahasranaama mentally 
when bed-ridden. As a matter of fact, it was taught to Dharmaraja by 
Bheeshma while the latter was of bed-ridden, lying on a bed of arrows!

Normally, it is difficult to concentrate on mantra when one is physical not 
feeling well or perfect. If one keeps up one's sadhana even when one is not 
well and even when the body simply does not want to do any sadhana, sadhana 
at such times is far more useful to one's progress.

Best regards,
Narasimha
