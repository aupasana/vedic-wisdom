Looks like there maybe a repeat of flood like situation in Mumbai again as =
it happened in 2006!



The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva =
Sutra

Namaste,
=C2=A0
It was during a series of 3 eclipses=
 like this that Krishna Bhagavan taught Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna. This total=
 solar eclipse has interesting planetary combinations. This is a great time=
 for spiritual progress. In Boston time (EDT), the eclipse is from 7:58 pm =
on 2009 July 21 to 12:18 am on 2009 July 22. In India time (IST), it is fro=
m 5:28 am to 9:48 am on 2009 July 22. In GMT, it is from 11:58 pm on 2009 J=
uly 21 to 4:18 am on 2009 July 22.
=C2=A0
You can meditate, do homam (to an=
y deity) or just contemplate on the meaning of life, who you are or on some=
 articles or books you read. Whatever sadhana you do during the eclipse tim=
e, all the best!

A Note on the Eclipses =
in July-Aug 2009

The occurrence of three consecutive eclipses =E2=80=93 a =
lunar eclipse on 2009 July 7, a solar eclipse on 2009 July 22 and another l=
unar eclipse on 2009 August 6 =E2=80=93 has generated a lot of interest. Es=
pecially the solar eclipse of July 22 occurs when Sun is in the 6th degree =
of Cancer, which is Sun=E2=80=99s Mrityu Bhaga (death inflicting degree) in=
 Cancer. When the eclipse starts in New Delhi, Sun, Moon, Ketu and ascendan=
t are in the same rasi and navamsa. Hence, this can be a problematic eclips=
e.

Eclipse time is a very favorable time for spiritual sadhana, though tem=
ple rituals are halted during eclipses. There is a reason for it.

Sun and =
Moon are the eyes of Parama Purusha (the supreme cosmic being). Microcosmic=
ally, individual soul (Sun) and individual mind (Moon) are the eyes through=
 which we see the dual world around us. If individual soul and individual m=
ind stop seeing, one no longer experiences any objects in the field of dual=
ity. The objectification within Brahman ceases and one is established in Br=
ahman, i.e. non-dual nirvikalpa samadhi. In other words, one realizes Self.=


To fulfil one=E2=80=99s dharma as an individual in the field of duality, =
one needs to be awake to the duality. One needs the individualized consciou=
sness represented by Sun and Moon. Hence eclipse time when Sun or Moon is b=
locked is unfavorable for dharmik activities. Temples and temple rituals, w=
hich are performed for collective dharma of society, are understandably hal=
ted. However, it is a great time for spiritual sadhana for self-realization=
. This applies to homam as well. If one performs homam for material benefit=
s, one should stop during an eclipse. However, if one performs homam for sp=
iritual progress and self-realization, a homam performed during an eclipse =
is much more powerful than at other times. One can perform homam to any dei=
ty during an eclipse, though homam to an ugra devata may work better.
