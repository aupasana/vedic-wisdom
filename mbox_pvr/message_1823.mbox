This somehow reminds of a ques=
tion posed by Balaram Basu to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. According to Ramakri=
shna's divine vision, Balaram Basu belonged in a previous birth to the inne=
r circle of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu! Balaram Basu was very devout and pious, d=
id many austerities and spent many years serving saints at Puri, away from =
his hometown of Calcutta. Yet, he had his doubts on the existence of god.
 =

When he met Ramakrishna for the first time, he sat in a corner and listene=
d to Ramakrishna's words. When other people in the room left, Ramakrishna t=
urned to Balaram and asked him, "Is there anything you want to ask me?"
 
B=
alaram asked, "Yes, sir. Does God really exist?" Ramakrishna answered, "Cer=
tainly He does." Balaram asked, "Can a person see Him?"
 
Ramakrishna said,=
 "Yes, He reveals Himself to the devotee who thinks of Him as his nearest a=
nd dearest. Because you do not get any response by praying to Him once, you=
 must not conclude that He does not exist."
 
Balaram asked, "But why can't=
 I see Him when I pray to Him so much?"
 
Ramakrishna smiled and asked, "Do=
 you really consider Him to be as dear to your heart as your own children?"=

 
"No, sir", Balaram candidly answered, "I never felt that strongly for Hi=
m."
 
Ramakrishna then said in a sweet, convincing voice: "Pray to God, thi=
nking of Him as dearer than your own self. Truly I tell you, He is extremel=
y fond of His devotees. He cannot but reveal Himself to them. He comes to a=
 person even before He is sought. If a person comes one step towards God, G=
od comes ten steps towards that person. There is none more intimate and mor=
e affectionate than God."
 
*        *        *
 
As Ramakrishna once said,=
 one needs to think of god more than one thinks about parents, wife, childr=
en and about oneself, all put together. Try to do that. Then you will find =
the answer to your question yourself. A theoretical answer is useless. The =
proof of the pudding is in *your* eating it. If somebody else tells you tha=
t the pudding exists and one can eat it, that information has very limited =
use. In order to convince yourself fully, you need to taste the pudding you=
rself!
 
Though all gods and their stories are maya from a strictly vedanti=
c point of view, they are as much real as your own mind. If your mind is re=
al, all gods and their stories are real. When mind is in various planes of =
awareness, it is possible for the mind to become aware of gods and their pl=
ays.
 
*        *        *
 
In this context, I want to mention a small sto=
ry. Manish was approached by a Christian missionary in UK once. He asked Ma=
nish if he was a Hindu. Then he told Manish about how Jesus Christ is the s=
on of the real god, how Hindus are praying to unreal and wrong gods and hen=
ce doomed and how followers of Jesus Christ will go o heaven, etc. Manish a=
sked the person, "have you seen god or Jesus Christ". The person was perple=
xed and said no. Manish asked him "how do you then know that what you say i=
s true? Are you sure that you guys have understood Jesus Christ correctly a=
nd not misrepresenting his teachings now?" Then he mentioned calmly and con=
fidently, "Actually, I have seen Jesus Christ. If you want, I can show him =
to you too. Do you want to see him?" The missionary looked at him like a cr=
azy person and simply ran away.
 
See, one who is waxing eloquent about rea=
l god, son of god and heaven does not even think that it is possible for so=
meone to see Jesus Christ. When he was told that somebody saw Jesus and ask=
ed if he was interested in seeing, he thought the other person must be craz=
y and just ran away! He wasn't even curious to pursue further and see what =
the other person was upto. He simply concluded the other person is crazy!
 =

People these days, in many religions, have no faith. Even things that are =
quite possible seem impossible to people of this age.
 
*        *        *=

 
Those who have seen the movie "Lage Raho Munnabhai" may recall how Sanja=
y Dutt starts getting visions of Gandhi. He sees and hears Gandhi while oth=
ers cannot. It is concluded at the end that the visions of Gandhi were hall=
ucinations caused by the attachment of the stressed out mind to Gandhi and =
resulting chemical imbalance in the brain.
 
Loosely speaking, one may say =
that seeing gods is similar. But the difference is that it is far more blis=
sful. For another big difference, see the example:
 
http://groups.yahoo.co=
m/group/vedic-wisdom/message/951
 
God can be experienced as light, as soun=
d or as a specific form similar to a human form, etc. In the above example,=
 one goddess was experienced as sound. It can certainly be a hallucination,=
 but the interesting thing is that another person had the same experience a=
nd he knew that this first person had that experience!
 
*        *        =
*
 
I will give another similar example. One person who does Chandi homam e=
veryday called Lord Rama in fire after Chandi homam on a Sri Rama Navami mo=
rning and did a homam to Lord Rama. In the night, he made some preparations=
 for the next day's homam (like he would do every night) and laid out some =
dried coconut pieces in homa kundam, on top of previous day's burnt ashes, =
for starting fire on the next morning. He then went to sleep. In the middle=
 of the night, he woke up. He became aware of his body lying on the bed. He=
 then became aware of the homa kundam which was a few feet away on another =
floor. It felt like his body and homa kundam were linked. Then it felt like=
 suddenly there was fire in homa kundam and, at the same time, his energy r=
ose. As soon as that happened, he lost regular awareness of his body. He no=
 longer felt his body or homa kundam or energy in the body. He first felt l=
ike he lied with head down and legs up and then he became absolutely weight=
less. Then he felt like he was a small point, a small particle. It felt lik=
e Lord Hanuman pulled him up and he went very fast into a region filled wit=
h bright light. He was a weightless particle floating in that light along w=
ith Lord Hanuman and nobody else. He, the small particle, started praying t=
o Lord Hanuman and remained in a blissful state for a while.
 
Suddenly, fr=
om somewhere, a thought came about his body being in a bedroom and fire in =
homa kundam. He wondered, "was there fire in homa kundam really?" This dist=
urbed his state and his regular self-awareness (i.e. being aware of self as=
 a body) returned.
 
The interesting thing is this. When he went to his hom=
a kundam to do homam next morning, he saw that the dried coconut pieces pla=
ced there on the ashes previous night were burnt and completely black. It m=
eans there was indeed a fire in the homa kundam. He used the same procedure=
 everyday and placed coconut pieces on the ashes for the next day's homam b=
efore sleeping, but such a thing never happened. Basically, there must have=
 been some ember left still from the previous morning, though he did not se=
e any ember in the night and thought the fire went out completely. For some=
 reason, that unseen ember started up a small fire in the night and the coc=
onut pieces caught fire. Though there is no way to know when that happened,=
 it is consistent with what he felt during the mystical experience! After d=
aily homam for a long time, a relationship formed between him and the homa =
kundam. Moreover, the ember left in homa kundam continued to be linked to h=
is internal fire and developments related to it still affected his internal=
 fire and consciousness!
 
When you do homam for a long time with the menta=
l visualization linking that external fire to your internal fire, the relat=
ionship is formed over the time! What happens in that external fire does th=
en affect your consciousness. Even if the fire goes and ember is left burie=
d under the ash, that ember is still linked to your internal fire!! When so=
mething happens in your internal fire, the same thing happens to the ember =
too. And vice versa.
 
*        *        *
 
Dear Utpal, one can see God fo=
r sure. One can experience God in many forms. One can see god externally, i=
n a limited form like a human form. One can see god internally, when shakti=
 (energy of self-awareness) rises to a specific place and becomes aware of =
beings in that place. One can experience god as an all-pervading light or s=
ound and experience oneself as a small part of that light or sound. There a=
re many ways to perceive god, but the bottomline is that god does exist and=
 one can perceive god. I cannot show you god, but I can guarantee you that =
god exists and can be perceived in various forms.
 
Do homam everyday with =
sincerity. That will burn the blocking karmas. Eventually you will be able =
to love god more than anything, including yourself. That is when the final =
screen will start to disappear. Nothing can be a substitute for spiritual s=
adhana.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

es in different religions!)
        Namaste Utpalji

        I have had the=
 same experiences. Most of our puranic stories are made fun of by others. 
=

        Well in most of the cases these questions are of malicious intent,=
 those don't bother me much, but at some point someone ask's these question=
s genuinely.

        I tried reading different opinions of different respe=
cted saints and I found one explanation in the introuductory chapters on Sr=
i Aurobindo's "Secrets of the Vedas".

        He opines indirectly that th=
e Puranas are definitely a toned down version of what used to be the Vedic =
knowledge. This was made this way for the oridinary people to understand an=
d not leave the folds of Hinduism. The threat then was Buddhism. That is wh=
y not only these stories were "made" which were based on deeper spiritual s=
ymbolism generated from the Vedas but even the lagugae was modified and mad=
e easier. The sanskrit of the Vedas is different from the sanskrit of the p=
uranic age.

        The reason Buddism could become such a threat to Hindu=
ism was because the people (priests) had reducded the Vedas to a book of me=
re rituals. The Vedas are both internal and external, but the priests took =
over the religion from the sages/mystics and reduced/neglected/forgot the i=
nternal and relied solely on the external. That is why Buddha rejected the =
Vedas.
        Infact as per Sri Aurobindo, the comng of Buddha was a wrong=
 step in the cycle of evolution. He is not the next automatic choice after =
Krishna and that, Kalki will recitify the mistake of Buddha. However, the c=
oming of Buddha was in a reverse way, needed to hasten the overall spiritua=
l evolution of this world by increasing the distance between God and man. 
=

        So essentially, the Purans were somewhat like comemrcial Bollywood=
 movies as compared to the Vedas which were the Art films.

        My pers=
onal take on this: As far as they are able to induce spirituality in an ver=
y average ordinary person from a village they are excellent. But at the sam=
e time, if a Hindu who is not aware of the comprehensive nature of his own =
scriptures, a poor, uneducated man, is told that his idols are mere stones =
and his stories are cock and bull whereas God must be necessarily much beyo=
nd all this, the idea of a single God, would be enough reason to make him s=
witch religions. It would sound very logical to him. Infact, this is how it=
 often happens.

        Solution: I have no clue. Maybe it is time we need=
 to learn our religion better. And the whole host of Babas and Swamis on te=
levision would do well to try and educate their followers about the compreh=
ensive/all inclusive nature of Hinduism instead of mere reciting the storie=
s from teh Puranas.

        -Regards
         Rajarshi

e (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra

        Namaste Narasimha Garu and friends,

          Rajarshi's question =
was in some aspect similar to one question i was asked about a month ago. w=
hile traveling back to home from office, one person asked me that what is t=
hese stories of our Gods such as Ganapati and his story of being Shiva's so=
n and cutting of head and replaced by elephant head etc...
          Storie=
s of Vishnu and like wise many gods and goddesses. The person told me that =
people from other make fun about all these various gods and their *mytholog=
ical* events which is recorded in our Shastras.

          I wish to ask he=
re a nagging question. what is the truth. for instance, did Ganapati and sh=
iva's episode actually happen? Stories in Devi Mahatmay are true?. Episode =
of Daksh Yagya and Uma's self killing in yagya vedi out of anger and origin=
 of Shakti pithas are true?

          Stories of Indra and other many gods=
 and goddesses are true?

          Do they really exist? (Even if at the d=
ifferent plane of existence) or the people who criticize are right when the=
y say that yours is a full of stories which are only mythological and you p=
ray those imaginary Gods which are nothing but characters of Stories of som=
e writer.

          I could not answer the question as i was not sure.

        Spiritually yours,

 Some may say that external forms of deities who personify different aspect=
s of divine energy running the universe are a creation of the mind. However=
, they are not a creation of the current state of mind. Mind has accumulate=
d many layers of conditioning though many lives. Thus, one may not have eve=
r seen or thought about or imagined a specific form of a deity in this life=
, but may have a vision of that form, on account of conditioning accumulate=
d through many lives. An example is the boy mentioned in the following mess=
age:

          > 
          > He had not read about some of the av=
ataras of Vishnu he saw above the fire. But he saw them and could describe =
them. This is because those forms represent a personification of a certain =
energy and his mind imagined that energy in that form in a previous life. T=
he memory stayed with the mind (though not consciously) and it can come bac=
k anytime. So, though he did not know about that form, that form appeared b=
efore him.
          > 
          > Swami Vivekananda famously said (paraph=
rased) , "a human being imagines god as a super human being with many hands=
 and heads. If a buffalo imagines god, it may imagine god as a super buffal=
o with many horns". Though he is right in a sense, it is misleading too. It=
 may incorrectly trivialize external forms. Though external forms are a wor=
k of the mind, that does not make them unimportant.
          > 
          =

rry" as a ritual is an important habit. Not teaching a child words because =
he cannot anyway understand their correct meaning is wrong. The child shoul=

ning later Similarly, though the energy represented by a form is more basic=
 than a specific external form associated with that energy, many people wil=

So, if one's mind tends to imagine a form, one should imagine the form and =
worship that form.

else is a creation of the mind over the time. If we say that a form of a de=
ity or an experience is an imagination of the mind, it does not mean it is =
a hallucination. Mind is connected to its field of experience. Various mind=
s in its field of experience are connected to it. For example, the experien=
ce described in the following message was independently "observed" by two p=
eople. Human mind can imagine things and hallucinate, but two minds observi=
ng the same thing is different from a typical hallucination:

arly, when a divine energy is present in a place, one may perceive the ener=
gy as deity X and another may perceive it as a deity Y. Just as the express=
ion one uses to describe the feeling one perceives is based on the language=
 one knows, similarly the form mentioned by one to describe the enegy one p=

ion one is exposed to.

Chandi homam. When he finishes the homam, he calls back the Divine Mother i=

ce energy around him and feels peaceful and happy. When he was doing this o=
neday, a gentleman was visiting and sitting right behind him. His eyes were=
 closed and he was meditating. When the above happened, he was baffled and =
opened his eyes to see what was going on. He had a vision of a dark goddess=
 who was jumping towards him along with a big pile of kumkum (vermillion po=
wder) all around Her. He was overwhelmed by the vision and opened his eyes.=
 But the person who did homam perceived only some nice energy and no specif=
ic form. Thus, the same energy may be perceived by different people in a di=
fferent form. One person may perceive only some energy and another may perc=
eive a specific form. Yet another may perceive a different form. The exact =
perception is based on the conditioning of the mind. But the energy itself =
is uniform, though the form is not.

Manish was approa=

he was a Hin=

real god,=
 how Hindus are praying to unreal and wrong gods and hence doomed and 
how =
followers of Jesus Christ will go o heaven, etc. Manish asked the person, 
=
"have you seen god or Jesus Christ". The person was perplexed and said no. =

Manish asked him "how do you then know that what you say is true? Are you =
sure 
that you guys have understood Jesus Christ correctly and not misrepre=
senting his 
teachings now?" Then he mentioned calmly and confidently,=
 "Actually, I 
<EM>have</EM> seen Jesus Christ. If you want, I can sho=
w him to you too. Do you 
want to see him?" The missionary looked at him li=
ke a crazy person and simply 
ran away.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>See, one wh=

<FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>I will give another similar example. One person=
 who 
does Chandi homam everyday called Lord Rama in fire after Chandi homa=
m on a Sri 
Rama Navami morning and did a homam to Lord Rama. In the night,=
 he made some 
preparations for the next day's homam (like he would do ever=
y night) and laid 
out some dried coconut pieces in homa kundam, on top of =
previous day's burnt 
ashes, for starting fire on the next morning. He=
 then went to sleep. In the 
middle of the night, he woke up. He became awa=
re of his body lying on the bed. 
He then became aware of the homa kundam w=
hich was a few feet away on another 
floor. It felt like his body and homa =
kundam were linked. Then it felt like 
suddenly there was fire in homa kund=
am and, at the same time, his energy rose. 
As soon as that happened, he lo=
st <EM>regular </EM>awareness of his body. He no 
longer felt his body or h=
oma kundam or energy in the body. He first felt like he 
lied with head dow=
n and legs up and then he became absolutely weightless. Then 
he felt like =
he was a small point, a small particle. It felt like Lord Hanuman 
pulled h=
im up and he went very fast into a region filled with bright light. He 
was=
 a weightless particle floating in that light along with Lord Hanuman and 
=
nobody else. He, the small particle, started praying to Lord Hanuman a=
nd 
remained in a blissful state for a while.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=
=3DArial size=3D2> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Sudd=
enly, from somewhere, a thought came about his 
body being in a bedroom and=
 fire in homa kundam. He wondered, "was there fire in 
homa kundam really?"=
 This disturbed his state and his regular self-awareness 
(i.e. being aware=
 of self as a body) returned.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2=
> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>The interesting thing=
 is this. When he went to his 
homa kundam to do homam next morning, he saw=
 that the dried coconut pieces 
placed there on the ashes previous nig=
ht were burnt and completely black. 
It means there <EM>was</EM> indeed a f=
ire in the homa kundam. He used the same 
procedure everyday and placed coc=
onut pieces on the ashes for the next day's 
homam before sleeping, but suc=
h a thing never happened. Basically, there must 
have been some ember left =
still from the previous morning, though he did not see 
any ember in the ni=
ght and thought the fire went out completely. For some 
reason, that unseen=
 ember started up a small fire in the night and the coconut 
pieces caught =
fire. Though there is no way to know when that happened, it is 
consistent =
with what he felt during the mystical experience! After daily homam 
for a =
long time, a relationship formed between him and the homa kundam. 
Moreover=
, the ember left in homa kundam continued to be linked to his internal 
fir=
e and developments related to it still affected his internal fire and 
cons=
ciousness!</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2> </FONT></DIV=

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>When you do homam for a long time with t=

visualization linking that external fire to your internal fire, =
the relationship

affect your consciousness. Even if the fire goes and=
 ember is left buried under 
the ash, that ember is still linked to your in=
ternal fire!! When something 
happens in your internal fire, the same thing=

IV>He opines indirectly that the Puranas are definitely a toned down 
     =
   version of what used to be the Vedic knowledge. This was made this way 
=
        for the oridinary people to understand and not leave the folds of 
=
        Hinduism. The threat then was Buddhism. That is why not only these =

        stories were "made" which were based on deeper spiritual symbolism=
 
        generated from the Vedas but even the lagugae was modified and ma=
de 
        easier. The sanskrit of the Vedas is different from the sanskri=
t of the 
        puranic age.</DIV>
        <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=
=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
        <DIV>The reason Buddism could become such =
a threat to Hinduism was 
        because the people (priests) had red=
ucded the Vedas to a book of 
        mere rituals. The Vedas are both inte=
rnal and external, but the priests 
        took over the religion from the=
 sages/mystics and 
        reduced/neglected/forgot the internal and =
relied solely on the 
        external. That is why Buddha rejected the Ved=
as.</DIV>
        <DIV>Infact as per Sri Aurobindo, the comng of Buddha was=
 a wrong step 
        in the cycle of evolution. He is not the next automa=
tic choice after 
        Krishna and that, Kalki will recitify the mistake=
 of Buddha. However, 
        the coming of Buddha was in a reverse way, ne=
eded to hasten the overall 
        spiritual evolution of this world by in=
creasing the distance between God 
        and man. </DIV>
        <DIV><FO=
NT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
        <DIV>So essentially, t=
he Purans were somewhat like comemrcial Bollywood 
        movies as compar=
ed to the Vedas which were the Art films.</DIV>
        <DIV><FONT face=3DA=
rial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
        <DIV>My personal take on this: As=
 far as they are able to induce 
        spirituality in an very average or=
dinary person from a village they are 
        excellent. But at the same t=
ime, if a Hindu who is not aware of the 
        comprehensive nature of hi=
s own scriptures, a poor, uneducated 
        man, is told that his id=
ols are mere stones and his stories are 
        cock and bull whereas God =
must be necessarily much beyond all this, the 
        idea of a single God=
, would be enough reason to make him switch 
        religions. It would so=
und very logical to him. Infact, this is how it 
        often happens.</DI=

      =
    teach "I am sorry". A parent speaking Hindi may teach "mujhe maaf 
    =
      keejiye". Another Hindi speaking person may teach "mujhe maaf karo". =
A 
          parent speaking Telugu may teach "nannu kshaminchandi" . Anoth=
er 
          Telugu speaking person may teach "nannu kshaminchu". And so o=
n. The 
          words are different. But they represent the same thought =
and 
          emotion.<BR>> <BR>> Actually, at one level, the meanin=
g is 
          slightly different in each case, depending on the peculiari=
ties and 
          cultural context of the language used. For example, the=
 English 
          expression has "I" as the subject and one is talking ab=
out how one 
          feels. The Hindi and Telugu expressions have the oth=
er person as the 
          subject and asking him to forgive. The amount o=
f respect shown is 
          different in different expressions. Thus, the=
 exact meaning is 
          slightly different. Thus, children speaking di=
fferent languages may 
          visualize something slightly different as =
their understanding of the 
          languages improves. However, these di=
fferences are minor. As one 
          delves deeper, the basic emotions as=
sociated with these different 
          expressions is the same in differe=
nt languages and one will feel those 
          emotions with compassion as=
 one masters the language.<BR>> <BR>> 
          Similarly, deities, =
rituals and mantras used in different religious 
          traditions may b=
e different, but they may represent the same divine 
          energy and t=
he same spiritual experiences. Just as the immeidate 
          visualizati=
on of an expression in the mind of a child may change based 
          on c=
ultural context and grammar that one is exposed to, the immeidate 
        =
  imagination of a deity's gross/external form in the mind of a sadhaka 
  =
        may change based on the religious paradigms and spirutal context th=
at 
          one is exposed to. However, these differences are minor. As o=
ne delves 
          deeper, the basic energies and experiences represented=
 by various 
          deities and rituals are the same in different religi=

          one will experience the same spiritual truths=

          path.<BR>> <BR>> No wonder Rigveda s=

gt; One language may have a lot

          language may have fewer w=

          equator may have a s=

 has so many words. Native language of Alaskans, who

          English for=
 slightly different kinds of snow, whereas English calls 
          all of =
them as "snow".<BR>> <BR>> Similarly, religious 
          traditions=
 that explored slightly different kinds of the same divine 
          energ=
y may have personified those energies as different deities. So 
          s=

      =

          and try to understand what exactly their expression =
means and feel the

          a creation of the mind. However, they are not a creation of th=
e 
          current state of mind. Mind has accumulated many layers of 
  =
        conditioning though many lives. Thus, one may not have ever seen or=
 
          thought about or imagined a specific form of a deity in this li=
fe, but 
          may have a vision of that form, on account of conditioni=
ng accumulated 
          through many lives. An example is the boy mention=
ed in the following 
          message:<BR>> <BR>> <A

 =
         the avataras of Vishnu he saw above the fire. But he saw them and =

          could describe them. This is because those forms represent a 
  =
        personification of a certain energy and his mind imagined that ener=
gy 
          in that form in a previous life. The memory stayed with the m=
ind 
          (though not consciously) and it can come back anytime. So, t=
hough he 
          did not know about that form, that form appeared before=
 him.<BR>> 
          <BR>> Swami Vivekananda famously said (paraphra=
sed) , "a human 
          being imagines god as a super human being with m=
any hands and heads. 
          If a buffalo imagines god, it may imagine g=
od as a super buffalo with 
          many horns". Though he is right in a =
sense, it is misleading too. It 
          may incorrectly trivialize exter=
nal forms. Though external forms are a 
          work of the mind, that do=
es not make them unimportant.<BR>> 
          <BR>> Until one learns =
how to feel sorry and show that feeling, 
          saying "I am sorry" as =
a ritual is an important habit. Not teaching a 
          child words becau=
se he cannot anyway understand their correct meaning 
          is wrong. T=
he child should be taught even if he does not understand. 
          He wil=
l understand the true meaning later Similarly, though the energy 
         =
 represented by a form is more basic than a specific external form 
       =
   associated with that
