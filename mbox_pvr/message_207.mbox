Namaste,

The coins that are put in the fire along with the poornaahuti in a homam 
come in touch with the fire containing divine presence. They become 
"purified" due to the contact and some of their impurities are removed. 
These coins can be put in the pooja room along with the idols of gods and 
you can recite your mantras before them.

In fact, if you want to invoke god in a solid form (like an idol) and offer 
mantras, these coins are a good candidate. Thus, you can use these coins in 
many poojas and vratams. The idols in your pooja room may have many 
impurities due to the thoughts, speech and actions of the persons involved 
with its making and distribution. A coin purified in a homam may is a good 
conductor of divine energy. Even though a coin from homam may look deformed 
and burnt, it is actually as appropriate for invoking gods as a beautiful 
idol.

If somebody performs homam on a regular basis, it is not necessary to put 
coins in poornaahuti everyday. One then ends up with too many coins. When 
one offers oneself in the poornaahuti, whatever happens to the coin happens 
to one's own consciousness slowly. When one can purify one's own 
consciousness, there is no need to surround oneself with external objects of 
some purity. The final goal in surrounding oneself with external objects of 
some purity is to eventually purify oneself. Fire in homam being the purest 
thing we have access to in the physical plane, spending time with it 
frequently is the fastest way. In the absence of such a practice, the 
objects purified in a homam can be used.

Best regards,
Narasimha
