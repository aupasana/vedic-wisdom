I am not sa=

Namaste Sir,

Let me add my 2 cents=
 of perspective on your nice observations.

> The examples I give above doe=
s not illustrate a picture of people who were
> compassionate and always wi=
lling to forgive and forget.

Forgiving and forgetting is not necessarily s=
aattwik, when it is the work of a dense ego. For example, one may do it to =
look good or impress others. Similarly, hurting someone is not necessarily =
taamasik/raajasik, when it is a result of a light ego. For example, Maharsh=
i Bhrigu hitting Vishnu in the chest with his foot was a divine drama for a=
 higher purpose.

Copying the actions of divine beings requires some intell=
igence. To borrow an idiom from my mother tongue, a fox does not become a t=
iger if it paints stripes on its body.

People you are talking about are ve=
ry high level beings. Those who efface their ego and start to self-identify=
 with some higher deities will start to exhibit the nature of those deities=
. Their actions may be fierce at times, but their purpose will be divine.

=
Whether one wants liberation or one wants saayujya (togetherness) or yoga (=
oneness) of a deity or whatever one wants, the first step is to efface ego.=
 All sadhanas are meant for that only. If you want to achieve what Vimalana=
nda or someone else achieved, the starting point is to efface your ego thro=
ugh sadhana. As you make progress, at some stage, you may start seeing some=
 results.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve noticeable resul=
ts if one is thinking of it. A cricketer telling himself "I must score a ce=
ntury today" is unlikely to score a century. The best strategy is to take i=
t a ball at a time and focus. Similarly, best strategy in sadhana is to sto=
p thinking about results and just focusing on the "here and now".

Moreover=
, liberation is not ruled out even in this age. Ramakrishna said that he wo=
uld come back a century later and that people would be liberated en masse i=
n that birth. Even in these times, it is possible to be liberated.

* * *

=
Bhupendra ji, here is a mail I sent before you joined this list. Manish con=
siders himself a spiritual son of Vimalananda and has a similar nature. I a=
m privately aware of some incidents similar to what you described below wit=
h Vimalananda. However, the essence of Manish's mesage is to do sadhana and=
 efface ego, i.e. what I wrote above.

 and has a similar nature. I am privately aware of some incidents similar t=
o what you described below with Vimalananda. However, the essence of Manish=
's mesage is to do sadhana and efface ego, i.e. what I wrote above.<BR><BR>=
