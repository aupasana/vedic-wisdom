Namaste friends,
=C2=A0
In the next few weeks/months, I want to share=
 with all my independent interpretations of the vedic mantras for nine plan=
ets.
=C2=A0
Though I am mostly restricting my spiritual writings to vedic-w=
isdom yahoogroup these days=C2=A0and sparing astrology related yahoogroups,=
 I am sending this to astrology yahoogroups also, as BPHS talks about these=
 mantras in the chapter on graha shanti.

This mant=
ra is a very popular mantra for worshipping Surya (Sun god). It is used in =
Navagraha homam and navagraha pooja as a part of Satya Narayana vratam. Par=
asara Maharshi (father of Veda Vyasa Maharshi) specified this mantra as a r=
emedy for any problems related to Sun in the horoscope (see "Brihat Paaraas=
ara Horaa Saastram").

My interpretation may be different from what Sayana,=
 Max Muller etc gave. Especially when it comes to the second line, most sch=
olars have interpreted "ratha" as chariot and alluded to Sun going around e=
arth on a chariot. I have a different Vedantic take on it. I know some Sans=
krit, but it is the inner inspiration given by Mother Mahalakshmi that enab=
les to interpret.

May erudite scholars ignore me if they find my interpret=
ation faulty!

shyan =3D experiencing [though pashyan basically means "watching", it also =

Meaning in Brief:

Existing with all the l=
ight and the darkness, dwelling in the imperishable Brahman as well as the =
perishable creation, Savita, with the pure essence of Brahman and with the =
desire that causes movement in it (and results in creation), moves into all=
 beings including the gods and experiences through them all the worlds and =
the beings of this diverse creation.

Detailed Commentary:

If you study ca=
refully, this verse gives the essence of Vedic philosophy. It contains the =
essence of great scriptures such as "Yoga Vaasishtham" and "BhagavadGita" ,=
 sooktas such as Purusha Sooktam and Narayana Sooktam and hymns such as Gan=
apathi Atharva Seersham. It is a very important hymn.

Savita is the highes=
t form of Surya. He is basically the supreme cosmic being. He is Atman, the=
 pure spirit that fills the entire universe - the creation as well as the u=
ncreated. He is the pure light behind all the light and darkness that we se=
e. Good and bad, gods and demons, pleasure and pain, all such dualities are=
 but different manifestations of the same Brahman. The ONE Brahman manifest=
s as the duality and diverse beings.

The one Atman, which is but pure ligh=
t, manifests as duality - as light and darkness - and fills the entire univ=
erse. Savita dwells in Brahman as well as the entire perishable creation. E=
verything that has manifested has to perish. Savita dwells in all - in the =
imperishable Brahman as well as the perishable manifestations of Brahman (v=
arious worlds, gods, demons and other beings).

The ONE pure light of Savit=
a manifests as DIVERSE objects ranging all the way from pure light to darkn=
ess and fills all beings. With the pure and untaintable essence of Brahman =
and the movement caused in Brahman due to desire, Savita enters all the bei=
ngs including gods. In other words, all the beings are created from Brahman=
 and the desire/movement in Brahman.

Vedanta teaches that Brahman is unman=
ifested pure consciousness. A part of Brahman causes movement in Brahman, w=
hich becomes a desire and gets fulfilled immediately. This results in the c=
reation of various beings. The word "ratha" refers to this. The pure essenc=
e of Brahman (hiraNyaya) as well as the desire that caused a movement of th=
ought in Brahman (ratha) enter all beings. Savita enters all being as Shiva=
 as well as Shakti!

When all the desires come to a halt and the movement o=
f mind stops, all beings can experience the pure essence of Brahman that ha=
s entered them (i.e. sat-chid-ananda) . When the desire is there, there are=
 thoughts and movement of mind and the beings do not experience the pure es=
sence of Brahman that has entered them.

The hymn says that the pure essenc=
e of Brahman (Shiva) and the desire that causes movement of thought (Shakti=
) are both aspects of ONE Savita only.

Savita enters all the beings with t=
he pure essence and the desire/thought and experiences the worlds and being=
s through them. If a person called "Narasimha Rao" exists, it is actually S=
avita who exists through him. If a person called "Narasimha Rao" experience=
s the entire world - various worlds and beings in those worlds - it is actu=
ally Savita who has entered him that experiences the entire world through h=
im!! All his thoughts, experiences and actions are actually those of Savita=
 - the in-dwelling spirit.

This is the same as what Ganapathi Atharva Seer=
sham means by "tvameva kevalam kartAsi...". This is the same as what Krishn=
a means when he tells Arjuna in BhagavadGita that it is Krishna who acts th=
rough various beings and that the beings should not be deluded to think tha=
t they are doing things.

Savita in this hymn is represented as the same su=
preme cosmic being that is referred in various other Vedic scriptures!

Mos=
t authorities have interpreted the second line to mean that Sun goes on a c=
hariot and watches the entire world. That is a gross interpretation and mis=
ses the subtle and deeper meaning.

In fact, when Atman goes on the chariot=
 (ratha) of desire (ratha), it moves and sees the diverse creation. When th=
e chariot (ratha) stops, then the desire (ratha) stops and there is no move=
ment of thought. No longer a diverse creation is perceived and there is onl=
y bliss of true being (sat-chid-ananda) . Thus, even the gross chaiot inter=
pretation is a metaphor for the subtle interpretation given above!

This hy=
mn is very important as it covers several important Vedantic concepts:

(1)=
 The supreme cosmic being is one, but assumes duality.
(2) The supreme cosm=
ic being enters all the beings with the duality.
(3) The supreme cosmic bei=
ng experiences through all the beings.
(4) The pure essence of supreme cosm=
ic being enters all the beings and helps them experience sat-chid-ananda.
(=
5) The desire (movement of thought) in the supreme cosmic being enters all =
the beings and results in movement of thought within them and diverse world=
 experiences.=C2=A0
