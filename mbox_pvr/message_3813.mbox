Namaste,
 
> i heard ramakrishna say aghora was backdoor entry through toil=

> while the front door is open why use the backdoor
 
The=
 same priest who told people "why use the backdoor when the front door is o=
pen" may later ask people to use the backdoor when some construction work i=
s happening at the front door and the passage is very narrow. After all, th=
e main thing is to reach god. As I keep saying again and again, specific ad=
vice given by saints may be adopted to their desa-kaala-paatra.
 
Things ch=
ange from time to time and from place to place. For example, the pervasiven=
ess of sexualized imagery in mainstream media that is encountered by people=
 in their daily lives today from a very young age, were not there 120 years=
 back. There are so many changes like that in our environment. What impact =
do they have on the minds of people and the challenges faced by them in spi=
ritual progress? Will the relevance and usefulness of different methods und=
ergo change with time?
  
People like to stereotype and restrict ideas and =
concepts to stereotypes. But one need not call oneself an aghori or engage =
in all aghora practices to benefit from some ideas associated with aghora.
=
 
BTW, whether one uses the front door or backdoor, the main thing is to re=
ach god inside. If someone has aversion for  backdoor, that's fine and he c=
an use the front door.
 
*        *        *
 
BTW, Ramakrishna did engage =
in all the 64 practices of tantra, under the guidance of Bhairavi Braahmani=
 who was sent by Trilinga Swami.
 
Also, Ramakrishna did meet Trilinga Swam=
i in person and fed him rice pudding with his own hands. Aghori Vimalananda=
 also met Trilinga Swami before his life transformed with the darshan of Sm=
ashana Tara and said Trilinga Swami was his guru-bhai (i.e. same lineage). =
It is a small world with many interesting connections.

Now on to the thread quoted below..
 
Comment on Rajarshi's original po=
int:
 
Rina is something you "owe" and hence "give back". Rina is all about=
 giving and not taking. Most sense gratification people engage in involves =
more taking than giving. When you "give" something (to others or to univers=
e), you are paying back your debt. When you "take" something (from others o=
r from universe), you are creating a new debt that will need to be paid bac=
k later. A simple formula is "give all you can and do not get worked up if =
you are not receiving enough in return". Of course, when you have an opport=
unity to give different things to different people and have to pick some, y=
ou have to use your judgment to pick the right ones, to pay off a more impo=
rtant rina with the little you have!!
 
The problem is that it is so diffic=
ult to give without getting something back (i.e. pay back old debt and crea=
te a new debt)! This is true with anything and not just the example of sex =
you mentioned. Of course, when it comes to sex, it may be even more difficu=
lt. One may tend to think more about one's own pleasure than partner's. Eve=
n when one thinks about partner's pleasure, it may be with an egoistic focu=
s ("am *I* able to give pleasure"). Who forgets own pleasure and thinks "I =
will submit to the god in my partner and give as much pleasure as I can to =
god in this form. My own pleasure does not matter at all and I will not thi=
nk about it"? If one indeed does that successfully, then hardly new rina is=
 created and old rina is paid back.
 
Now, forget sex. Even in other things=
, giving goes hand-in-hand with taking and we often create new rinas. As lo=
ng as our ego remains, we are always pursuing self-gratification in many wa=
ys.
 
Suppose I made a promise to my guru in last life to spread homam and =
astrology and created a rina. Or suppose I undermined them in my last life =
and ended up creating a rina. Or suppose I benefited from those subjects an=
d created a rina.
 
Somehow or the other, suppose I created a rina that set=
 the stage for the work of this life. Suppose the rina requires me to do so=
mething for those subjects, e.g. teach homam, teach astrology, give a free =
astrology software etc. All this is what I am "giving", i.e. I am paying ba=
ck a rina I created before somehow or the other.
 
Now, suppose people star=
t praising me for what I am doing and I feel proud and gratified. This grat=
ification I derive is something I am "taking" from others and the universe.=
 So this is a rina.
 
Of course, I cannot control what others do. When I gi=
ve something to them - knowledge or manuals or software etc - they may prai=
se me to ANY level. That I cannot control. But I CAN control how proud and =
gratified I feel. By conscious effort, constant contemplation, surrender to=
 the Mother and viewing it as a lila in which I a small instrument, I can t=
ry to not focus my mind on what universe is giving me and focus it instead =
on what more I can give to the universe.
 
*        *        *
 
> > > If b=
y exercising ones will power, an individual is able to avoid paying a rna, =
what happens then? < < <
 
Everything you took does need to be paid back. A=
ctually, paying back is never a problem. If you can pay back a rina without=
 incurring a new rina in the process, it is safe anytime to give back and t=
here is no need to delay or avoid.
 
But, if that is not the case, you can =
try to use your will power to delay payback to a time later when you are ho=
pefully able to give without taking something back.
 
*        *        *
 =

Utpal, in your example, "Curse, Constantly follow-up, Mount Abuses, Remain=
 under stress" under (1) are useless activities. They involve no giving and=
 no productive action.
 
I said earlier: "Of course, when you have an oppor=
tunity to give different things to different people and have to pick some, =
you have to use your judgment to pick the right ones, to pay off a more imp=
ortant rina with the little you have!!"
 
So part of option (1) is valid. I=
f one believes there is a chance to retrieve the money and put it to a good=
 use to fulfil some other important rina, one can try. But, if one determin=
es that there is no chance, one should be able to put it to rest (i.e. (2))=
. Similarly, one should put in one's effort prepared for any outcome and no=
t thinking about the money always.
 
What action you engage in decides the =
outcome and not whether you think about this action and its object all the =
time. By thinking about it all the time and becoming anxious, you achieve n=
othing. In fact, such anxiety may sometimes cloud your judment, stop you fr=
om doing the right thing and reduce your efficiency. Attachment limits effi=
ciency. It is action that gets result and not attachment. Detached action i=
s the best formula for efficient action. Both inaction and attached action =
are formulas for disaster.

Narasimha

 Everything, it is said, is a Rna. If there is a Rna, can it be avoided? My=
  limited  understanding of Karma says in this law there is no mercy, but o=
nly action/reaction. Either you pay the rna or you burn the rna through sad=

 of Self ("feces") while eating it. A successful Aghora may be eating feces=
