Namaste Sir,
 
Fire in homam is a symbol of Sun on earth. External Sun shining brightly and destroying external darkness is akin to the inner light shining brightly and destroying inner darkness. Burning homam fire is meant for stimulating and making the inner light shine brighter. So, normally, homam is performed during the daytime. When Sun is just rising and destroying darkness is a great time for homam.
 
External rituals are meant to cause internal modification through resonance. Rules and conventions followed in rituals are meant for maximizing the internal result of a ritual. They are not meant for scaring one away from the ritual!
 
Doing homam in the evening or night is not a "wrong deed" at all. Unlike some deities who may manifest in different forms during morning or afternoon or evening, Krishna is Krishna always. He can be worshipped anytime. In fact, he was born around midnight!
 
My 2 cents is that you should feel free to do Krishna homam in the evening, after your work. If you like Krishna, go for Krishna homam.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
