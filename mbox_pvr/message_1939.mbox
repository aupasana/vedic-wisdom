Namaste,
 
It is what you wrote, but with some minor correction. I can reco=
rd other mantras in my voice and share with all, but instructed to not give=
 Savitru Gayatri mantra in my voice to anyone. It is my spiritual food. Mos=
t of my spiritual experiences came with this mantra and I need this mantra =
for more things in future. So I keep it to myself and do not share it with =
all.
 
But many people in your city should be able to teach you this mantra=
 with correct pronunciation. By the way, I think you live in Chennai. If so=
, please try to meet Swami Sathasivom at Kalikambal temple on Thambuchetty =
Street near Central station. He belongs to a rare class of priests who are =
fast becoming extinct in this commercial age. If possible, meet him and tak=
e his blessings.
 
My intuition tells me that you are a man made for karma =
yoga rather than meditation and veda mantras. Surrender to your chosen deit=
y, see that deity in all people and serve people around you. See god in all=
 people. If possible, think of starting a small movement in the slums of Ch=
ennai (or wherever you live). Go, serve people there, help them to the best=
 of your ability and teach them about god. After helping them materially fi=
rst, then teach them to chant god's name when they have a few minutes of ti=
me. In my opinion, this is the right path for you.
 
Actions performed with=
 ego, pride and attachment bind one. Actions without ego, pride and attachm=
ent liberate one. Please perform big acts of social service and yet without=
 any pride or attachment. Do not be upset with a few failures in the beginn=
ing (upset comes with attachment. A detached person is not upset if his sin=
cere actions do not give the intended result) and keep trying calmly. Since=
re and detached action never fails in the long run. Start slowly.
 
Best re=
gards,
Narasimha
