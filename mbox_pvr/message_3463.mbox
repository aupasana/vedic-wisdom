Namaste,

I was not upset or felt insulted.

By "mind's reality", I do not =
only mean the conscious reality (which you are aware of when awake).

Desir=
e of spiritual progress is a good desire to have. But desire/expectation of=
 spiritual "experiences", "visions" and miracles and associating them with =
spiritual progress is bad idea. It can block one, unless one is fortunate a=
nd protected/rescued by a good guru.

Overcoming a desire and denial of a d=
esire are different, though some may confuse between the two.

Best regards=
,
Narasimha

      Dear Narasimha Bhai,
=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Please do not get upset or serious. St=
anding in a line for samadhi was a joke, humour, laughter. It was not a ins=
ult, it was a friendly tickling.

Many of my dreams are prophetic. Although=
 they happen to me yet=C2=A0 it is not a reality made up by my mind.
Severa=
l years ago Shri Hanumanji appeared to me in dream and said something. In t=
he morning while drinking tea I said to my mother that last night Shri Hanu=
manji appeared but I cannot make out what He said. My mother jumped up and =
said it was for her. She had been doing certain prayers and had then stoppe=
d before completing it. I had no idea about it because
 I was not living in=
 London then.

Some months after, again I had dream in which Shri Hanumanji=
 appeared and touched my head and my nephews head whom I saw in the room wi=
th myself and my mother and left our house. He did not touch my mothers hea=
d. In the morning I said to my mother why my nephew who lives in US, was in=
 my dream in our house and why Shri Hanumanji has blessed him and not any o=
ther member of the family. My mother did not know. Much later we learned th=
at he was getting ready for a admission to a medical collage in US and.he i=
s a doctor in Washington now.
=C2=A0
Again after some months Shri Hanumanji=
 appeared  and told me to recite a Sacred Mantra. I could not, would not ev=
en imagine such a thing. I am not a yogi or devotee or some  high spiritual=
 being. It was not part of my reality.

You appeared to me in a lucid dream=
 some years ago standing in my room looking at religious pictures at my tab=
le. I did not know you nor had
 asked any jyotish questions in the forum.Yo=
u were not part of my minds reality. When I wrote to you after several mont=
hs as I thought I was leaving London, you said I should study YogVasisth. W=
hy did you say that?=C2=A0 I knew immediately I would not be leaving London=
. How come this idea came to you? Or was it Grace of Divine Mother comforti=
ng me in my situation through a complete stranger far away.

I no longer be=
lieve that by having desire or expectations for spiritual experiences, bloc=
ks them. I used to but not anymore. We are not in Truth if we secretly desi=
re them but outwardly act and speak in a different way.Few years ago I foun=
d a wishing well. I said, Please Divine Mother do not appear to me in Physi=
cal form in London but give me a Darshan in dream. Divine mother and loving=
 Father gave me Darshan again& again & again & again & again. Their energy =
and memory become so intense I could hardly think clearly. True they came o=
n
 their on own accord, but I did not say I do not desire them.

Who knows =
one day in future you might be standing in line with Rajarshi in some Templ=
e and Rajarshi might experience samadhi later on. I do not know what Divine=
 Mother will do?

Thanks
LaxmiNarayan

N=
amaste Sir,
=C2=A0
It is your dream and what you saw were *your* dream obje=
cts. It is a reality made up by your mind, based on its conditioning. What =
they were doing in that line is better answered by your mind than by any ot=
her person.
=C2=A0
Seriously, however, Savikalpa samadhi, Nirvikalpa samadh=
i, Sahaja samadhi etc are not things you can obtain or buy, by standing in =
a line. Moreover, spiritual experiences never occur when one is expecting o=
r anticipating them. Various spiritual experiences occur when most thoughts=
 cease in the mind and mind is focused on something specific, such as a dei=
ty, a name, a mantra, a thought etc. The desire or pre-occupation
 with a s=
amadhi or a spiritual experience will often work as a barrier blocking one =
from good focus and concentration.
=C2=A0

Narasimha

=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Few days ago I had a dream. I saw Narasimha and=

Hay guys, what you were doing in that=
