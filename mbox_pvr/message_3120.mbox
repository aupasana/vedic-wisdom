Namaste,
 
Have a nice trip!
 
Please excuse my bluntness, but I was a bit amused when I read your innocent query. This is like asking "I am going to so and so bank to withdraw some money. How can I make what I get financially optimum?"
 
Whether you go to a small bank or a big bank, you will only get what is available in your account (or credit line). If your account is small, you cannot withdraw one million dollars even if you go to the biggest bank in the world. The focus should be on working hard and saving your earnings.
 
Tirupati is a nice temple. While in the trip, keep chanting "Om Namo Venkateshaaya" or "Om Namo Bhagavate Venkateshaaya" within your mind, whatever you are doing externally. If your mind is dwelling on a mantra most of the time, it minimizes undesirable thoughts and creates purity of the mind. A pure mind receives and reflects god's light better than a mind pre-occupied with a lot of useless thoughts arising from the mental conditioning. Keep chanting the mantra.
 
You can, of course, do that even when you are not in Tirupati. Repeated sadhana with a mantra can create a situation where your mind starts chanting that mantra sub-consciously when it is idle. That saves the mind from some useless activity.
 
BTW, please do not address me as "Guruji". People should just call me Narasimha or PVR.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
