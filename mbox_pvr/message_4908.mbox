Namaste,

Rajarshi is correct - Shiva's words on Kunjika stotra do NOT =
say that it is equivalent to reading Chandi. If one wants a short version o=
f Saptashati, one can go for Saptashloki. However, to get the same effect a=
s Saptashati (700 verse prayer), one needs to do Saptashloki (7 verse praye=
r) 100 times!
 
> However, in time people became lazy.
 
Good point. People=
 want shortcuts. Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts that really work. Es=
pecially one weighed down by heavy karmas needs to put in an intense effort=
 to remove material obstacles and achieve spiritual progress.
 
*        * =
       *
 
When Parvati asks Shiva for a shortcut using which learned men c=
an chant Vishnu's 1000 names *at all times* (nityaM), Shiva says: "shrI raa=
ma raama raameti rame raame manorame. sahasranaama tattulyaM raamanaama var=
aanane.."
 
Some people think that chanting this one verse is equivalent to=
 chanting Vishnu's 1000 names. When told to chant 1000 names everyday, they=
 just chant this once and be done with it. That will hardly work, for that =
is not the purpose of this shortcut!
 
If you want to establish your mind o=
n God *at all times* and want to use a mantra for that purpose, Vishnu Saha=
sra Naama is too long. Then one can mentally chant the above verse or just =
chant "shrI raama raama raama". That can be done by the mind no matter wher=
e one is and what one is doing. So one can be contemplating Vishnu all (or =
most) times. THAT is the purpose of short-cut and NOT to enable one to cut =
short one's pooja from 20 minutes to 20 seconds!
 
People who are searching=
 for a shortcut - a magical formula - that gives them good material and spi=
ritual results without investing much time, energy and effort, are pursuing=
 a pipe dream.
 
Stop searching for a magical formula, pick something and s=
tart spending time and energy. It WILL slowly start to make a difference!

Narasimha
