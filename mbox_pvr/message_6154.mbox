Namaste,

Suppose a child is under the delusion that there is a monster in the 
next room and that the monster will come and hurt him. One may tell him, 
"if you close this door, monster won't come" or "if you light this 
bright light in your room, monster won't come" or "if you stop crying, 
monster won't come" or "if you do so and so thing, monster won't come".

The child may be afraid of the monster and do several things to prevent 
the monster from coming and hurting him. That is a good thing.

But the basic factor is that there is NO monster in the next room! ;-) 
However, if you just declare that to the child, the child will never 
completely overcome the fear. Instead, use the pretext of safety from 
monster to make the child to do some good things. Eventually, the child 
will realize that there is no monster.

*        *        *

Rituals and all sadhanas we do are kind of like the good things the 
child in the analogy does to remain safe from the monster. The notion 
that we are not divine and that we experience good and bad things is the 
monster. Just as a monster is very real for the child, this notion is 
very real for us. Just pretending bravery that there is no monster will 
not lift the grip of an imaginary monster on the mind.

Do various things to make you feel comfortable. But, in the end, the 
monster you are trying to remain safe from does not even exist...

*        *        *

I do not appreciate those who downplay rituals and sadhana and say that 
all is god. If you are down with a severe disease or your limbs are cut 
off and you still see god in that suffering and remain in an exalted 
state, then you can claim that all is god. Otherwise, all is NOT god for 
you. More sadhana is needed to internalize the theoretical statements.

At the same time, those who enquire about minute details of rituals are 
like an innocent child who asks, "to keep the monster at bay, is it 
better to do my homnework in a red notebook or a blue notebook?" 
Bottomline is that the monster is unreal and it is good to do your 
homework irrespective of which notebook you use. As the child learns 
more, works more and grows intellectually, oneday he will realize that 
the monster is unreal.

*        *        *

I've been busy. I will try to reply to some specific questions in 
future. But, the fundamental answer to many questions is given above! 
Rest assured that most details being sought are not that important. Have 
faith in god, surrender to god and do homam with the faith that god IS 
really in fire. Despite any procedural shortcomings, you WILL make 
spiritual progress.

Best regards,
Narasimha
