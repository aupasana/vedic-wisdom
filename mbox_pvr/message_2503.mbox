om] Internal god and external god (R: Query related to Maha Ganapathi Homam=
)

=A0 
Dear Rajarshi,
=A0
You have a knack for asking important questions,=
 that sound simple but touch upon deep issues.
=A0
> I mean if I am focusin=
g on Mahaganapati, am I just bringing out the
> energy of Mahaganapati from=
 inside me or is there one single, universal,
> omnipotent divinty called M=
ahaganapati who exists in the universe, and
> I am trying to invite him int=
o the fire?
=A0
Terms like internal god and external god are just a manner =
of speaking, for easy=A0understanding and simplification of concepts. In re=
ality, a deity existing microcosmically "inside" you, a deity existing micr=
ocosmically inside me, a deity existing microcosmically inside someone else=
 and a deity existing "externally" in the macrocosm (universe) is one and t=
he same and there is absolutely no difference between all of them! That is =
essentially the Upanishadic understanding.
=A0
In fact, when you say "insid=
e me", ask yourself : "what is this I"? Is it the physical body? Is it the =
subtle body? Is it the causal body? When mind entertains the notion that it=
 is a physical body, it indeed becomes aware of a physical body and looks a=
t it as I. When mind entertains the notion that it is a subtle body, it ind=
eed becomes aware of a subtle body and looks it as I. When mind entertains =
the notion that it is a causal body, it indeed becomes aware of a causal bo=
dy and looks it as I. When mind finally overcomes all such notions one afte=
r the other, it may look at the supra-cosmic body (supreme cosmic being) as=
 I. According to upanishadic understanding, there is nothing other than Bra=
hman or supreme cosmic being. Thus, expressions like "inside me", "inside y=
ou" and "inside him" are just expressions that describe false notions rathe=
r than reality. There is no real you, I and he, but there is only a supreme=
 cosmic being.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
When=
 you have a conditioned mind, which has a notion that there is a certain en=
tity called "Rajarshi Nandy", an entity called "Narasimha Rao" etc, these e=
ntities exist within your mind, for as long as your mind=A0can keep those n=
otions alive. When all such false notions are successfully eliminated, only=
=A0supreme cosmic being is left for the mind to focus on.
=A0
When a condit=
ioned mind that has a notion that it is a specific person called "Rajarshi =
Nandy" in a specific body, such a mind is pre-occupied with so many things =
that it cannot focus itself on god perfectly. Due to its pre-occupations, i=
t can only focus itself on small aspects of god, in a very limited way. Thi=
s is like a mirror capturing Sun in a limited way. Sun's image may be refle=
cted on 100 mirrors in 100 ways. One mirror may be broken and dark colored.=
 It may reflect very little sunlight and sun may appear broken. Like that, =
each mind can focus on god in a different way, to a different extent. We ex=
press this fact in alternate words by saying "the mind focuses on internal =
god and he is limited".
=A0
This is just a simple way to put things. In rea=
lity, the issue is not internal vs external. The issue is the mind's abilit=
y to perceive and focus on god. As the mind's pre-occupation with other thi=
ngs comes down and its ability to focus on god goes up, we say that the int=
ernal god is becoming stronger. Again, this is just a way of representation=
. In reality, god, whether you call him internal or external, is infinite a=
nd does not become weaker or stronger. But mind can focus better and mind's=
 idea of god becomes stronger. After all, a dirty mirror reflecting Sun may=
 show a dirty and dull Sun at first and show a cleaner and brighter Sun aft=
er you clean the mirror. Sun has not really become cleaner or bighter. He i=
s the same always. We can say "Sun in the mirror" has become cleaner and br=
ighter. But there is really no Sun "in the" mirror! Though we may talk abou=
t Sun in mirror 1, Sun in mirror 2, Sun in mirror 3 and the external Sun, t=
hey are all one and
 the same!
=A0
This manner of speaking about internal v=
s external god and talking about strengthening internal god is used to simp=
lify things. Bottomline is that any visualization of god by a mind is limit=
ed by the conditioning, abilities and impurities of that mind. By allowing =
the mind to visualize god, to the best of its ability, on a regular basis, =
we sharpen its ability to visualize god. Eventually, mind loses all other p=
re-occupations and becomes fully absorbed in the infinite god. Then we say =
that internal god has become infinite. This is just a manner of speaking.
=
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
I want to give a sm=
all practical example, that is somewhat relevant and illustrates some conce=
pts.
=A0
Once=A0a couple of priests with a high spiritual caliber were cond=
ucting a Rudraabhishekam. They were chanting Sree Rudram 11 times. A person=
 who worships Mahaalakshmi was sitting in a corner of the room. He started =
to meditate with Savitru Gayatri mantra, his favorite mantra. Whichever man=
tra or deity he worships, he always considers everything to be an offering =
to Mahalakshmi and imagines only her as receiving the mantra. Here also, he=
 was visualizing Mahalakshmi as filling his entire being and was offering G=
ayatri mantra to her. After a while, his Kundalini rose and his self-awaren=
ess was modified. He lost the regular awareness of body, perceived an all-p=
ervading light that he was part of and remained in a nice spiritual state f=
or a while. When he came back and the pooja was finished, one of the priest=
s described something unusual that he "saw". In the middle of the pooja, th=
at priest turned towards this person and was surprised by what he saw. He s=
aw
 a tall=A018-handed form of Mahalakshmi standing in=A0the place of this =
person for a little while.
=A0
As that person meditated, his=A0senses turne=
d inward and he was looking internally. His mind was focused on Mahaalakshm=
i, who filled his entire being in his visualization. As Kundalini rose, his=
 distinction of internal and external blurred and he perceived himself as *=
a part* of all-pervading light (it is neither "internal" nor "external"). H=
e basically perceived Mahaalakshmi as the all-pervading light that he was a=
lso a part of. However, the priest who happened to look at him at that time=
 was also in a purified state and so he noticed something. His mental condi=
tioning at that time=A0made him see a specific=A0external form rather than =
an all-pervading form. But both the priest and the person perceived the sam=
e entity in two different ways. One was external and limited. The other was=
 neither internal nor external (but obtained by looking internally at first=
) and unlimited. But, both are the same. They appeared different to two min=
ds because of the
 conditioning of those minds rather than anything else, j=
ust as the same Sun may appear different in two different mirrors!
=A0
*=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
No amount of theorization w=
ill help one fully understand and appreciate things like this. The most imp=
ortant thing is to do some sadhana, such as homam or meditation, on a regul=
ar basis.. No effort is wasted and eventually gives results when there is c=
ritical mass. Whatever I say, whatever masters have said before and whateve=
r rishis taught in upanishads, can be understood and appreciated through di=
rect experience. THAT is the goal of sadhana. Reading scriptures and mails =
like this is only a starting point. One has to engage in some sadhana. Even=
 people like Ramana Maharshi, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Trilinga Swami, Vive=
kananda etc did sadhana for many years, before they realized god.

There is something which I find a little confusion. I hope you will clear t=
hat point. You mentioned:
>=A0
>The god in your homam fire is not an extern=
al god, but your own internal god. Through your mental focus, you are proje=
cting the limited manifestation of god inside you into fire and honing your=
 ability to focus the mind on that god. I want to clarify one thing here. T=
hough there is actually infinite divinity inside you, your pre-occupation w=
ith so many other things limits (or zeroes) the divinity that your mind can=
 focus on, access and perceive. By focusing on it more and more, you grow i=
t. Fire is a good medium to project it for focusing better.
>=A0
>When we a=
re doing a homam or any puja, we are trying to create the deity from within=
 ourselves where it exists. My questions is, is this where all deities resi=
de(inside) ? I mean if I am focusing on Mahaganapati, am I just bringing ou=
t the energy of Mahaganapati from inside me or is there one single, univers=
al, omnipotent divinty called Mahaganapati who exists in the universe, and =
I am trying to invite him into the fire?
>=A0
>I remember a line from Vimal=
ananda where he says, initially we create the deity in the astral body=A0so=
 that this deity (the one we projected)=A0may lead us to the real deity who=
 exists outside in the universe.

ct? Kindly put down your thoughts on this.
