Namaste Sharad,

(1) Yes, it is. I will write more in a separate mail on homam during 
eclipse.

Mahaganapathi homam is more than a remedy for Ketu. It takes care of one's 
material life and gives spiritual progress.

(2) In my opinion, doing Mahaganapathi homam for a couple of years will be 
beneficial. After that, settling down with a Surya homam, perhaps with the 
ashtakshari mantra of Sun, may be good.

Best regards,
Narasimha
