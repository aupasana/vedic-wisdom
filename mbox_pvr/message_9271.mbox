Dear Rajarshi,
=A0
Even Parasara did not say there are just 9 or 10 avatara=
s or that there is a one-to-one correspondence to grahas. He too said there=
 are innumerable avataras. Avataras can come with a combination of paramatm=
amsas (supreme/absolute being portions) and jivatmamsas (living/relative be=
ing portions) taken from grahas in any combination. Though 9 main avataras =
of Vishnu came from paramatmamsas of 9 grahas, many many other avataras als=
o descended on earth due to various other combinations of paramatmamsas and=
 jivatmamsas of the same 9 grahas! There are obviously many possibilities.
=
=A0
In fact, Parasara says that ALL beings contain some paramatmamsa and so=
me jivatmamsa, coming from grahas. But jivatmamsa is predominant in most of=
 us.
=A0
When one leaves earth, paramatmamsas in one return to respective g=
rahas and jivatmamsas take birth again based on desires. In the 'end', even=
 the jivatmamsas return to respective grahas. At the time of Mahapralaya, g=
rahas also merge back in Supreme Lord.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
As for Kalki, Parasara did not clarify and we can onl=
y speculate. Though some people associate him with lagna, that makes no sen=
se to me either. That is inconsistent with the overall framework laid by Pa=
rasara (i.e. beings born with combinations of paramatmamsas and jivatmamsas=
 from *grahas*).
=A0
Kalki will probably come with paramatmamsas of both Su=
n and Moon. After all, Kalki shows Shiva and Shakti (Sun and Moon - soul an=
d mind) coming together finally!! Just a speculation..
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Whether you take 9 or 10 or 22 avataras=
, the theory of evolutionary spiritual perfection does not add up because "=
perfection" occurred before the last avatara, unless you break away from ma=
in scriptures and throw away Buddha (and discount Kalki as he has not come =
yet).
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Rather than "=
evolution", it is a matter of what the world needs at that time. If people =
at the beginning of Satya yuga are established in Self always and the only =
issue is that a small attachment may develop now and then, disturbing that =
state of being established in Self (i.e. stealing of Veda!), then the aspec=
t of consciousness that is relevant is "spirit of detachment" (Ketu). If in=
voked, it removes that attachment and takes one back to being established i=
n Self. So an avatara corresponding to Ketu occurred.
=A0
As collective con=
sciousness became denser, being established in Self became less natural and=
 more effort was needed. So the "spirit of patience, persistence and hard-w=
ork" (Saturn) became relevant and an avatara corresponding to Saturn occurr=
ed. And so on.
=A0
In the dark ages of Kali yuga, rational minds wouldn't a=
ccept anything that didn't "make sense". Being established in Self became a=
n unnatural, ridiculous and incomprehensible notion. So the "spirit of comp=
rehension" (Mercury) became relevant. An avatara corresponding to Mercury o=
ccurred and tried to explain being established in Self as a comprehensible =
notion, so that rational minds of that age would accept it to an extent and=
 attempt it.
=A0
Avataras occur based on the needs of collective consciousn=
ess. Of course, if one's consciousness is in a different state from the col=
lective consciousness of that time, the current avatara may not be relevant=
 to one.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
> I respec=
t Rama, but I worship Krshna.
=A0
I am awestruck by Krishna and worship him=
, but I see Rama as an ideal that I MAY be able to emulate oneday. In fact,=
 I recommend the approach to others.
=A0
Though I said Rama and Krishna are=
 almost the same, there is a difference between soul and perfected mind. So=
ul is a spark of Shiva and a perfected mind is a spark of Chit Shakti (wher=
eas an imperfect mind is a spark of Maya shakti).
=A0

Best regards,
Narasi=

 (though paramatmamsa dominates jivatmamsa).

Krishna *alone* is Lord Himself and Rama is not is accurate! It only seems =
to say that all these rishis, manus, demigods etc are partial. As I said ab=

nufactured by the qualities of Maya". In the next verse, it further compare=
s forms of Lord to clouds in sky and dirt in air. Just as sky *contains* cl=
ouds and is beyond them, similarly Lord *contains* forms and is beyond them=
. So, again, what is the meaning of a specific form that descended on earth=

>=
>1. In the Bhagwata Purana, there are a list of 22 Avataras of Vishnu. In t=
his list of 22, Varaha Avatara is the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya is the 10th A=
vatara. Dattatreya, Nara-narayana,Vyasa Deva himself are in this list, and =
then the Bhagawata Purana goes ontu mention that the Avatars of Vishnu are =
innumerable. In the 10th Canto, Vyasa says all these Avatars, and innumerab=
le others, are amsas of the Supreme Being while Krshna is "swayam Bhagawan.=
"
>>
>>
>>2. Of these various possible Avataras, 10, or rather 9 as I belie=
ve, are/have been accorded special mention and significance across various =
Hindu spiritual literature, specially those which were composed in the Kali=
-Yuga, namely the Puranas.[When Krshna was alive, it was Kali-Sandhya, his =
physical presence had curtailed the full effect of Kali,once he left his bo=
dy, Kali started in full flow. All Puranas were composed after this, hence =
these are scriptures of the Kali-Yuga, as are Tantras]
>>
>>
>>3. These 10/=
9 Avataras have a fixed sequence of appearance. Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, Nara=
simha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krshna, (Buddha) and Kalki. There is an u=
nmistakeable connection of the form and sequence of these main avatars with=
 the evolution of life on earth. From the aquatic, to the amphibian, to the=
 land-animal, to the half-animal-half-man, to the dwarf man (first human li=
fe form who immediately takes possession of this earth represented by Vaman=
a's 3 steps), to the Rajashik avatara of Parashurama moving around with an =
axe, to the Sattwa Guna Avatara of Rama, to the Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. =
Also, this indicates that spirituality is not to be separated into another =
world, but is a progressive realization of the various manifestation and po=
tentials that lie inherent in the consciousness and its development through=
 various life-forms. Larger spirituality of earth and evolution go hand in =
hand. That is Nature's grand design for life on earth.
>>
>>
>>4. In this s=
pecifc context, I am only focusing on the parable of these main 9/10 Avatar=
s. It is not my contention that if one worships say Matysa Avatara, one wil=
l not attain to a state of liberation of the soul. As is the nature of spir=
itual cosmology in Hinduism, any Devata can lead a person to any depth of r=
ealization. And each one of the Avatars of Vishnu are self-realized in thei=
r own way and can be consider super-massive spiritual dynamos.
>>

>>
>>=
=A05. Of these, naturally, Rama and Krshna are most adored because they rep=
resent a stage of evolution, both inside as well as outside, which society =
can relate of much easier, in this age. Rama represents, for me, the stage =
of most satwic mind. A satwic mind is in control of itself. It known how to=
 transform the animal tendencies within and without - monkeys - into a cons=
tructive force for a greater purpose. However, as with a state of full Satt=
wa Guna, there can be instances, even though few, of dejection. For it is s=
tatic in nature and will change only when circumstances force it to. As per=
 the Valmiki Ramayana, Rama did feel dejected while searching for Sita in t=
he forest. He did have a moments fear before the final assault on Ravana, w=
hich was dispelled by Agsatha when the later revealed the stotra of the Sun=
 to Rama. At the end of the final battle, Rama tells Sita, in a most dispas=
sionate manner, that he killed Ravana not to rescue her, but it was
 the Dh=
arma to do so, and to unhold his family honour. That too was the dharma of =
that age when he lived, family honor. The way I look at this grand epic, an=
d I bow humbly to the genius of Rishis Valmiki for representing the things =
as they are, as a scribe, as a poet, as an observer, and not adding his own=
 preferences to it anywhere, in the 14 years of tribulation that Rama faced=
 which culminated into his killing Ravana, he changed into the most dispass=
ionate leader, such that no personal consideration or emotions or passions =
can overturn the Rajadharma. His life is a lesson of what a true leader mus=
t be! Krshna, OTOH, had this immaculate detachment right from birth. I am n=
ot taking his=A0 supernatural feats into account. It is his singular and co=
nstant detachment from situations, from people, from environment, from circ=
umstances that mark his life. At the age of eight, he decides to leave Vrin=
davana for Mathura. All his friends, his foster parents, his
 village-folks=
 who so loved him, pleaded with him that it would make no sense for him to =
leave the shelter, love and comfort of his happy, settled village life and =
head into an unknown destiny and destination. Krshna tried to reason with t=
hem, then he understood that they won't understand, he promised he will ret=
urn back once his work in Mathura is over. He never returned. Later, much l=
ater, when the Gopis came to him asking him to participate in their dance, =
he obliged. But the moment some of them started getting jealous and possess=
ive of Krshna, he removed himself quietly from the scene, saying that he be=
longs to everyone equally and no one has any special right over him. When S=
hishupala abused Krshna, the later merely kept dropping flowers on the floo=
r, smiling and counting. The moment the 100th abuse was over, he swiftly cu=
t off Shishupala's head and was back into his poise. But when Bhurishrava u=
nfairly accused Krshna of being a revolutionist and
 charlatan, Krshna did =
not kill him. When Duryodhana, who used to think of Krshna as another black=
 magician, wanted to arrest him, Krshna showed his vikarala roopa in the as=
sembly of kings, yet he did not finish the enemies off. The very next momen=
t he was back into his own poised self. Never in the whole Mahabharata is t=
here one instance of his going overboard, never a single shade of depressio=
n, equivocation, or lack of confidence in his actions, irrespective of what=
 others say or think of him. And then right in the middle of the greatest w=
ar he had the perfect equipoise to deliver the most sublime spiritual philo=
sophy. That is why his life remains the best ideal of Karma-Yoga. For a tru=
e Karma-Yogi by definition can never be dejected. It is impossible. Neither=
 the action nor the results belong to the instrument. When running away fro=
m the battle-field and killing Kaliya Yavana, or when advising Bheema to te=
ar apart Jarashanda, or gesturing Bheema to
 hit Duryodhana below the waist=
, or getting Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krshna, as if by some Divine Intuiti=
on, knew exactly how the situations must be lined up which would cause the =
destruction of these people. This kind of knowledge cannot come by the rati=
onal thinking. But happens when one is constantly and consciously connected=
 to the Universal Force. We do not find these kind of complex situations in=
 the Rama Avatara, at least in the Valmiki Ramayana. Of course, if we take =
the Adhbut Ramayana or such other auxilliary texts and retelling, we get a =
different picture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana we have a 1000 headed demon atta=
cking Rama after he kills Ravana, and then Sita turns into Adya Shakti and =
demolishes the 1000 headed demon and Rama worships her. But if we take only=
 the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the picture that emerges is very clear. =
Rama is the embodiment of Sattwic mind. Therefore he displays all the great=
 characteristics of satwa, chief of
 which is self-control, as well as the =
occasional sadness caused due to separation from his wife Sita whom, at lea=
st until Ravana was destroyed, he loved very dearly. Satwa guna creates a t=
rue saint, but can also cause some grief when the stability is shaken. Krsh=
na was gunatita. He had no attachment to anything in this world - man, wome=
n, deva, danava, friend, enemy - and therefore he was never affected any tr=
ace of negative emotion. His Ananda never left him even in the most trying =
situations. 6. Buddha was great spiritual force in this world. But I do not=
 see him fit in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His realization, the on=
e he advocated, is a static realization, an end in a void. This is clearly =
denying of the reality of this earth. I find this not in tune with what eit=
her Rama or Krshna espoused. None of them negated this world. If negation o=
f this world and life is the final aim, then why send so many avatars at cr=
ucial stages of evolutionary
 development? If the spiritual impact on masse=
s is the reason for Buddha being an Avatara, then why not Jesus or Zorathru=
sta.? They are no less impactful in that sense. But do they fit in the sche=
me of spiritual line that these 9 Avataras of Narayana indicate in a most l=
ogical manner? No. As such many vaishnava traditions in parts of India, do =
not consider Buddha to be an avatara. Realization, to be complete and holis=
tic, must be both static and dynamic, outside of life as well as inside of =
life. That is why the Tantras formed their own kind of spiritual philosophy=
, of the world as body of Shakti and therefore an object of reverence and r=
ealization. 7. The original literature of the Nath Yogis used to mention 9 =
chakras. These are centers of psychological functions. 6 inside the human b=
ody and 3 too subtle, or non-developed in most people, even seekers. It is =
my belief that each of the 9 Avataras - excluding Buddha - correspond to th=
e full power and force
 of one of these 9 Chakras. Similarly, the 9 grahas,=
 or that which can modify consciousness or allow the consciousness to explo=
re and express itself is various possiblities, are 9 in number. The lagna i=
s a reference point and not a graha. Therefore the chief Avatars who repres=
ent the parable of evolution are nine in number. And the ninth of the seque=
nce is yet to come. 8. I cannot comment on which graha would typically repr=
esent which Avatara. I know of what the BPHS says, however, it is my belief=
 - feel free to disagree with it -:)[one cannot rule out some deep-rooted c=
orruption of understanding or textual misrepresentation in this Kali-Yuga] =
- that the Atmah among the Avataras has not yet appeared. It will be Kalki,=
 or as Vimalananda seems to say in the Aghora books, Nishkalanka - the stai=
nless one. There is only one thing which is perfectly stainless, the Atmah =
.After a Nirguna/Gunatita awastha comes living in the full and complete pur=
ity and might
 and force and strength of the Atmah. By the sheer dint of hi=
s purity the last Avatara will burn away opposing forces of this world and =
fulfill the purpose of evolution. Even Krshna used diplomacy at various poi=
nts in his adult life to achieve his ends. Kalki, I am speculating, won't e=
ven need that. The white horse and that sword is a metaphor. He will be the=
 only one capable enough to rectify the various errors and corruptions that=
 beset our age. Well, this is how I look at the story of Avataras. It is pe=
rfectly ok not to agree with my views, but I am reasonably sanguine now tha=
t this is what is closer to truth. -Regards =A0Rajarshi

>>Na=
maste friends, =A0 There was a discussion on Lord Vishnu's Dasavataras on a=
 limited access forum on Facebook. A learned friend wrote that "Krshna is t=
he God-man", "Previous Avatars are a build-up to this stage" and "Buddha af=
ter Krshna is like going back from the linear progression of spirituality t=
hat the Avatars manifest one after the other upto Krshna". =A0 I want to em=
phatically disagree with this notion that Dasavatars of a "linear progressi=
on of spirituality..upto Krshna". =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 Each avatara represents an aspect of Supreme in a perfected=
 form. =A0 Maharshi Parasara equated dasavataras with planets. For example,=
 Rama, Krishna and Narasimha are Sun, Moon and Mars, respectively. =A0 We a=
lso know that Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ke=
tu are personifications of soul, mind, energy/initiative/drive, learning sp=
irit, wisdom/discrimination, spirit of enjoyment/being happy, patience/disc=
ipline,
 spirit of innovation/breaking barriers and detachment (respectivel=
y). =A0 Correspondingly, each avatara is an expression of that aspect of Su=
preme in a perfected form. Each story is an example of how that aspect oper=
ates. =A0 Lord Rama's story is a perfected example of how soul operates. Lo=
rd Krishna's story is a perfected example of how mind operates. Lord Vamana=
's story is a perfected example of how wisdom/discrimination operates. Lord=
 Narasimha's story is a perfected example of how energy/drive/initiative op=
erates. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 Now, let us=
 remember one basic thing. Soul in us, mind in us, energy in us, learning s=
pirit in us, wisdom in us, happiness in us, discipline/patience in us - all=
 these are different manifestations of the same Self. However, when Self ma=
nifests as these different aspects, it has different qualities and plays di=
fferent roles. There is no comparison between them. =A0 We MAY focus on one=
 aspect of us first,
 perfect it and then perfect other aspects through it.=
 But, we need balance between all aspects in the end. Similarly, these diff=
erent aspects of Supreme Being are incomparable and are in a balance workin=
g together in the Cosmos. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
 * =A0 One who is fascinated by the qualities of soul may like the story th=
at demonstrates how soul operates; one who is fascinated by the qualities o=
f mind may like the story that demonstrates how mind operates, and one who =
is fascinated by the qualities of wisdom may like the story that demonstrat=
es how wisdom operates. And so on. But this is just a matter of taste and s=
ubjective preference. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =
=A0 Let us focus on Rama and Krishna, i.e. soul and mind. Soul is seen as a=
 representative of god in us, because of some basic attributes of it. It is=
 the higher self and has no agendas, no likes or dislikes. =A0 Once mind fa=
ncies a separate existence with some
 agendas/desires, soul supports the in=
dividualized consciousness stemming from that fancy and sees it as its dhar=
ma. It lends strength and support to EVERY aspect of this individualized co=
nsciousness (e.g. mind, energy, intellect, learning ability, enjoyment, dis=
cipline etc). It supports them fully and yet has no desires/agendas/likes/d=
islikes of its own! It impassionately witnesses and records all of one's ag=
endas and karmas so that Laws of Nature give proper fruits later on. It doe=
s all that despite full awareness that it is neither doing those karmas nor=
 receiving the fruits. As mind and other aspects of the individualized cons=
ciousness entertain the notion that they are doing things and begetting the=
 fruits, soul supports them fully in this play. It sees that as its dharma =
and does it impassionately. =A0 Now, does this sound exciting? Perhaps not =
to all. This functionality of an impassionate witness supporting the play, =
may not seem interesting enough
 to some. =A0 On the other hand, mind has l=
ikes, dislikes and agendas. It is constantly pursuing those agendas, gettin=
g things and achieving things. Movement of mind is what keeps the individua=
lization going!!! Though soul is the support for everything else in the ind=
ividualized consciousness, soul is a witness doing its dharma impassionatel=
y. It is mind that keeps the individualization going and brings in agendas =
and passion and even decides/affects every entity's dharma. That way, mind =
is really the "boss" of the individualization. No wonder Krishna's life app=
eals more to one who may be excited by this description! =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 Lord Krishna is obviously awe-inspir=
ing, but let me put Rama's life in perspective. =A0 Rama's life demonstrate=
s how soul operates. At a young age, he received Brahma Jnana from Vasishth=
a and became realized. Yet, he did whatever was his "dharma". He helped Vis=
hwamitra. Soon after marriage, he was given
 kingdom. At the last moment, h=
is father banished him to forest at the behest of his step-mother and his s=
tep-brother was given the throne. He had no complaints. Though his father, =
step-mother and step-brother felt guilty to various degrees, he himself sup=
ported and consoled all three and followed his dharma impassionately. Thoug=
h he knew leaving Sita in the forest with Lakshmana and going after the gol=
den deer would cause problems, he did it impassionately when Sita insisted.=
 When she was kidnapped by Ravana, he searched for her and fought the battl=
e. He never faulted Sita for forcing him to leave her or faulted Lakshmana =
for leaving her later. He accepted every life situation with no complaints =
and did the best possible action then. Even as he killed Ravana, he did so =
without hatred or anger, but as his impassionate dharma. Even as Ravana was=
 dying, he went to him and respectfully learned some subjects that were goi=
ng to disappear with Ravana! =A0 Rama
 is a perfect example of a liberated =
man with no desires or agendas who impassionately discharges one's dharma a=
rising from the momentum of karmas before liberation. THAT is basically wha=
t soul does! =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 As ano=
ther example, let us look at Lord Vaamana. His story is a perfect demonstra=
tion of how wisdom/discrimination operates. =A0 He was born as a learned py=
gmy. He filled the entire cosmos to rid earth of a charitable demon king wi=
th many great qualities. =A0 Wisdom/discrimination makes one humble and una=
ssuming. When one is doing good work but tainted with demonic qualities (e.=
g. pride or attachment), one's discrimination is not pleased until that pri=
de is suppressed. When wisdom fills one's entire consciousness, then demoni=
c qualities are completely suppressed. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 Please think about the other avataras. The stories ca=
n be understood as perfect demonstrations of how various aspects of
 our co=
nsciousness operate, based on clues from Maharshi Parasara. =A0 Let us not =
compare Dasavataras, but celebrate each of them separately. Of course, if y=
ou are more attracted to one of them, please think about that avatara more =
and develop devotion. They are ALL capable of relieving us from samsara. =
=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 By the way, happy H=
anumajjayanti to those who celebrate it today (there are different schools =
of thought). =A0 Best regards, Narasimha -------- Astrology & Spirituality =

sp;<br>Even Parasara did not say there are just 9 or 10 avataras or that th=
ere is a one-to-one correspondence to grahas. He too said there are innumer=
able avataras. Avataras can come with a combination of paramatmamsas (supre=
me/absolute being portions) and jivatmamsas (living/relative being portions=
) taken from grahas in any combination. Though 9 main avataras of Vishnu ca=
me from paramatmamsas of 9 grahas, many many other avataras also descended =
on earth due to various other combinations of paramatmamsas and jivatmamsas=
 of the same 9 grahas! There are obviously many possibilities.<br> <br=
>In fact, Parasara says that ALL beings contain some paramatmamsa and some =
jivatmamsa, coming from grahas. But jivatmamsa is predominant in most of us=
.<br> <br>When one leaves earth, paramatmamsas in one return to
 respe=
ctive grahas and jivatmamsas take birth again based on desires. In the 'end=
', even the jivatmamsas return to respective grahas. At the time of Mahapra=
laya, grahas also merge back in Supreme Lord.<br> <br>*  &nb=
sp;     *        *<b=
r> <br>As for Kalki, Parasara did not clarify and we can only speculat=
e. Though some people associate him with lagna, that makes no sense to me e=
ither. That is inconsistent with the overall framework laid by Parasara (i.=
e. beings born with combinations of paramatmamsas and jivatmamsas from *gra=
has*).<br> <br>Kalki will probably come with paramatmamsas of both Sun=
 and Moon. After all, Kalki shows Shiva and Shakti (Sun and Moon - soul and=
 mind) coming together finally!! Just a speculation..<br> <br>* &=
nbsp;      *      &n=
bsp; *<br> <br>Whether you take 9 or 10 or 22 avataras,
 the theory of=
 evolutionary spiritual perfection does not add up because "perfection" occ=
urred before the last avatara, unless you break away from main scriptures a=
nd throw away Buddha (and discount Kalki as he has not come yet).<br> =
<br>*        *    &n=
bsp;   *<br> <br>Rather than "evolution", it is a matter of =
what the world needs at that time. If people at the beginning of Satya yuga=
 are established in Self always and the only issue is that a small attachme=
nt may develop now and then, disturbing that state of being established in =
Self (i.e. stealing of Veda!), then the aspect of consciousness that is rel=
evant is "spirit of detachment" (Ketu). If invoked, it removes that attachm=
ent and takes one back to being established in Self. So an avatara correspo=
nding to Ketu occurred.<br> <br>As collective consciousness became den=
ser, being established in Self became less natural and
 more effort was nee=
ded. So the "spirit of patience, persistence and hard-work" (Saturn) became=
 relevant and an avatara corresponding to Saturn occurred. And so on.<br>&n=
bsp;<br>In the dark ages of Kali yuga, rational minds wouldn't accept anyth=
ing that didn't "make sense". Being established in Self became an unnatural=
, ridiculous and incomprehensible notion. So the "spirit of comprehension" =
(Mercury) became relevant. An avatara corresponding to Mercury occurred and=
 tried to explain being established in Self as a comprehensible notion, so =
that rational minds of that age would accept it to an extent and attempt it=
.<br> <br>Avataras occur based on the needs of collective consciousnes=
s. Of course, if one's consciousness is in a different state from the colle=
ctive consciousness of that time, the current avatara may not be relevant t=

7_2_64_1367025215463_151">Namaste Rajarshi,<br> <br>Very nice to hear =
from you!<br> <br>The "unmistakeable" link to the *physical* evolution=
 of life on earth does not imply an increasing sequence of *spiritual* perf=
ection, as you cannot directly map the physical to the spiritual. More impo=
rtantly, if your understanding is correct, why isn't perfection occurring i=
n the FINAL incarnation but occurring well before?<br> <br>* &nbs=
p;      *       =
; *<br> <br>First, regarding Krishna being a "poornavatara", SrimadBha=
gavatam (SB) does not say that Rama is not one. In fact, Parasara, father o=
f Vyasa, explicitly mentioned that Rama, Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha are =
"poornavataras" (used that exact expression) while other avataras have some=
 amount of jivatmamsa too
 (though paramatmamsa dominates jivatmamsa).<br>&=
nbsp;<br>Secondly, after describing the avataras, SB says that there are in=
 fact innumerable avataras and that all rishis, munis, manus, demigods etc =
are avataras of Supreme Lord. It is under THAT context that 1.3.28 then pro=
ceeds to say "these avataras are partial, while Krishna is Lord Himself." I=
 question if the deduction that Krishna *alone* is Lord Himself and Rama is=
 not is accurate! It only seems to say that all these rishis, manus, demigo=
ds etc are partial. As I said above, Pararsara explicitly said that both Ra=
ma and Krishna are poornavataras.<br> <br>Third, let us ask a very fun=
damental question: What exactly does it mean if an avatara is "Lord Himself=
"?<br> <br>*        *  &n=
bsp;     *<br> <br>While SB talks of Krishna being=
 "Lord Himself" in 1.3.28, it also says in 1.3.30: "forms of Supreme Lord, =
who is in reality
 formless (arUpa) and of the nature of pure consciousness=
 (chidAtman), are manufactured by the qualities of Maya". In the next verse=
, it further compares forms of Lord to clouds in sky and dirt in air. Just =
as sky *contains* clouds and is beyond them, similarly Lord *contains* form=
s and is beyond them. So, again, what is the meaning of a specific form tha=
t descended on earth being "Lord Himself"? I am afraid people may be misint=
erpreting this notion based on their fancies and conditioning..<br> <b=
r>All beings are made up of paramatma (supreme/absolute being) and jivatma =
(living/relative being). The latter portion is dominant in us and is respon=
sible for desires and rebirth. Great avataras descend from a higher portion=
 of paramatma. Very rarely avataras descend entirely from paramatma without=
 ANY jivatma portion. Rama and Krishna are specific examples given by Paras=
ara.<br> <br>They are entirely divine, but they do not encapsulate the=
 entire
 divinity!!!! After all, "entire divinity" cannot be encapsulated b=
y any form just as no cloud can contain the entire sky. They take part in t=
he drama obeying and executing the divine will but NOT altering it. This ap=
plies to Krishna as well as Rama.<br> <br>*    &nb=
sp;   *        *<br> <br>=
> Buddha was great spiritual force in this world. But I do not<br>> s=
ee him fit in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His<br>> realization, =
the one he advocated, is a static realization,<br>> an end in a void.<br=
> <br>First, he IS mentioned in SB list of avataras as well as Parasar=
a's list. If he does not "fit" in your "scheme of evolutionary Avatars", th=
en your concept is possibly wrong and avataras are perhaps not "evolutionar=
y" as you theorize.<br> <br>Secondly, as per Parasara, Buddha correspo=
nds to Mercury, who personifies logical mind and the spirit of investigatio=
n
 and comprehension. Logical mind and its </span><span id=3D"yiv1051733789=

a perfected spirit of comprehension is not capable of grasping the Absolute=
 Reality completely, for it is beyond comprehension. So, no wonder it simpl=
ifies the Incomprehensible in an attempt to comprehend! That is what Buddha=
 ended up doing. However, logical mind has a great appeal in the Age of Rea=
son in this Kali yuga. No wonder Buddha was/is/will be a great spiritual fo=
rce in this world in this age.<br> <br>*     =
   *        *<br> <br>If =
you dismiss Parasara's linking of planets to avataras as a possible corrupt=
ion, are you absolutely sure that the verses of SB you are relying on are p=
erfect? (In any case, it's a different matter that you are only taking
 som=
e SB
 verses and ignoring some as I showed!.)<br> <br>The bottomline a=
s far as I am concerned is that Pararsara's list actually makes amazingly c=
oherent esoteric sense. The nature of each aspect of consciousness (e.g. Bu=
ddha - spirit of comprehension, Saturn - spirit of patience & persisten=
ce, Venus - spirit of happiness etc) and the story of corresponding avatara=
 DOES have a highly meaningful connection, esoterically speaking. After all=
, esoterically is how you really need to understand any higher scriptures a=
nd notions in them.<br> <br>If we take scriptures literally instead an=
d draw lopsided conclusions, some would conclude that Shiva is the "supreme=
" one and other deities are "inferior"; some would conclude that Surya is t=
he "supreme" one and other deities are "inferior"; and so on.<br> <br>=
*        *     =
   *<br> <br>On a different note, someone may think that
 Ka=
li, being Aadyaa, is superior to Tara and like Kali more. But, some learned=
 yogis have declared them to be essentially the same and some scriptures ev=
en prohibited differentiating between them. As I see it, the difference bet=
ween them is too subtle for even rishis to clearly comprehend. People seein=
g some significant difference between them are, I am afraid, merely project=
ing their own conditioning. Same in the case of Krishna and Rama. Both were=
