Namaste,

Mahasudarshana homam is g=
ood, but please remember that Mahasudarsana is a personification of Vishnu'=
s weapon. I recommend preferring normal devatas to astra devatas (deities w=
ho personify weapons).
=C2=A0
Devatas like Mahasudarshana and Pratyangira a=
re personifications of weapons. Their sadhanas are akin to taking a weapon =
and using it. When one takes a weapon, one can either do a ceremonial pooja=
 to it and put it back or actually use it to solve problems. Though homas a=
nd poojas to astra devatas were akin to the latter in old days, they are ak=
in to the former now-a-days. In the old days, detached sadhakas of a high c=
aliber existed in the priest class and they used to do homas and poojas to =
astra devatas like Mahasudarsana and Pratyangira and produced results quick=
ly. Though most priests of today are only capable of doing an aayudha pooja=
 rather than using the aayudha, they nevertheless instinctively go for thes=
e
 poojas based on the old habits. However, based on the changed capabiliti=
es, one should change the strategy.

Just as a son who is troubled by bulli=
es at school is better off complaining to mother or father and let them tak=
e care of the problem, instead of taking the weapon of mother or father and=
 trying to use it oneself, my humble opinion is that worship of deities who=
 hold those weapons is better today than worship of deities personifying we=
apons, to solve serious problems.

For countering black magic, I suggest do=
ing Rahu-Ketu homam or Chandi homam or Narasimha homam. Narasimha homam wit=
h "ugram veeram" mantra may be a good idea. For removing black magic, homam=
 or worship of Dattatreya is also a good idea.

If you want the specific ma=
terial result of removing black magic, maintain physical purity around you =
when you do homam. Offer black sesame seeds in homam. If you have a pomegra=
nate tree near you, offering pomegranate flowers in
 homam is a good idea. =
Put a full lime (green) everyday as poornaahuti and make sure it burns full=
y by putting enough fuel (wood/coconut/ ghee) along with it. You may need t=
o offer more ghee a few times as poornaahuti burnas, to make it burn fully.=
 Also, in the sankalpa of the homam, you may add "maamuddishya kR^itebhyaH =
abhicaaraadi prayogebhyo bhaavita pIDaayaaH upashamanaarthaM" (in ITrans tr=
ansliteration) after "so and so devataa prasaada siddhyartham" that appears=
 in the Sankalpa in the manuals.

Best regards,
Narasimha

=C2=A0 

Which homam works best fo=
r getting rid of black magic? I wish to call a temple priest but I am confu=
sed between Maha sudarshan,Chandi and Mahakali. Within a span of two months=
 if I ask the priest to perform homam 3 times then are they more fruitful t=
han the one done on a regular basis. 
I am doing Ganpati homam with great d=
evotion but still I see very little difference in life. Obviously my path t=
o sprituality is much tougher than others. So what rules shall I specially =
need to follow for results to show up. 
As I have chronic health issues my =
meditation is not efficient. Though I keep trying if a healthy body can giv=
e 70% I give only 30%. Hence the question always comes in my mind are my pr=
ayers working?

I can try getting answers from outside but once I say I hav=
e black magic priests only think of minting money. People coming in this fo=
rum are genuine and hence am looking for help here. Kindly suggest as life =
is going tough for me. I
 am willing to work hard but don't know the right =
approach. 

Thanks and regards,

Om shanti, shanti ,shanti
