Namaste,

Taamasik stuff like alcohol, meat, chillies etc should never be put in homam 
fire.

The type of fire used in homam is jaatavedas (omniscient) or havyavaaha (one 
who carries offerings to various gods). That fire can carry various 
auspicious substances to various deities, but does NOT like to carry stuff 
like alcohol and meat, even if a deity is willing to receive the offering. 
If you want to offer alcohol to a deity such as Bhairava, call the deity in 
an idol or a kalasha (pot) or in an animal and then make the offering of 
alcohol. But do not use homam fire to make the offering.

Another type of fire called kravyaada (funeral pyre) or ripravaaha (carrier 
of impurities) can be used to carry anything, without restrictions. However, 
this fire is not used in homam.

A few deities such as Smashaana Taaraa and Smashaana Kaali may be worshipped 
on a funeral pyre with any materials. However, such rituals are not 
appropriate for 99.99999999% people. Those are only for people who already 
have a very high level of detachment and a very low level of distinction 
between the polarities of duality, i.e. people who have a very low level of 
mental distinction between things normally considered highly pure and things 
normally considered highly impure and see all as One. As a result of their 
worship on funeral pyre, they may get results that are normally considered 
good or results that are normally considered terrible, but again their 
mental distinction between good and bad results is very low and they accept 
all results with an equal vision. Rituals practiced by such aghoris are 
aimed at honing their detachment and non-distinction to further perfection.

Such aghora practices are not to be done out of "fascination" or because 
they seem or sound "cool". That is a formula for failure and disaster. For 
the majority of us who are still deeply affected by the polarities of 
duality and cannot see all things equally, worship of any deity in funeral 
pyre is a strict no-no. Stick to regular homam and maintain basic purity, no 
matter which deity you worship in the fire. In that case, throwing chillies, 
meat and alcohol in fire is a strict no-no. Unfortunately, some people do 
not realize it and throw these things in their homam fire. This is a 
terrible thing to do.

People in this age foolishly mix up principles of duality and non-duality. 
Principles of non-duality like "all is god" are applicable only if you can 
see god in pleasure and pain and accept both the same way. If pleasure and 
pain are two distinct feelings for you and you prefer one to the other, then 
you are immersed in duality and follow the principles of duality without 
mixing up non-dual principles and pretending "all is god". All is NOT god 
for you then.

Offering alcohol, meat, chillies etc in homam can bring terrible results to 
one. One whose karmic pipeline is very short may experience the results 
immediately, but most people do not experience right away. As a result, they 
do not realize what a terrible thing they are doing. My humble request to 
everybody who performs homam is to stay away from using such taamasik 
materials.

Best regards,
Narasimha
