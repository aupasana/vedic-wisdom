 Saying mantras audibly (Re: Help me Regarding...)

=EF=BB=BF 
Dear Hari,
=
=C2=A0
Never hesitate to ask or say anything that may seem impertinent.
=C2=
=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
When a mantra is spoken, sound is produced at 4=
 levels. The lowest level is vaikhari. This is the sound at the physical le=
vel. When you say something by moving the physical body parts (lips etc), t=
heir movement=C2=A0vibrates the air particles and those vibrations vibrate =
the physical body parts in the ears of listeners and people around you can =
"listen".
=C2=A0
At the same time, the subtle thoughts in the mind accompan=
ying the chanting of the mantra result in movement in parts of your "subtle=
 body", which vibrate the subtle space around you and those cause some vibr=
ations in the subtle bodies of people around you.
=C2=A0
In this way, sound=
 (or vibration) is produced at 4 levels. The subtler the level, the longer =
the signal can carry without decaying.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
If one=
 has some shakti accumulated with a specific mantra, one's chanting of that=
 mantra is infused with that shakti.
=C2=A0
The energy infused when one cha=
nts a mantra is carried mainly in the subtler levels of sound. The energy c=
arried at the physical level (vaikhari) of sound is very small compared to =
the energy carried in the subtler levels. However, the vaikhari level sound=
 contains the key to the subtler levels for most people.
=C2=A0
I can expla=
in this using an analogy. One may have a powerful concept or idea in mind t=
hat one is thinking of. Most other people cannot read one's mind and cannot=
 access that concept or idea. However, if one expresses the idea in words, =
people will be able to access that idea. Most of the power is in the idea a=
nd not in the exact words used. However, the written/spoken words that are =
tangible to others act as a key to one's thoughts. World can now access the=
 power of one's idea!
=C2=A0
Similarly, the exact letters or words of a man=
tra are not really alive with energy. But, when one does sadhana with the m=
antra, one's chanting of the mantra is infused with some power. Other peopl=
e cannot access that power normally. But, once one says the mantra in an au=
dible form (just like expressing the idea in tangible words above), the pow=
er in one's chanting of the mantra is accessible to those who hear it. Even=
 though the power is not really in the audible sound produced, the audible =
sound acts as a key to the inaudible sound and world can now access the pow=
er of one's chanting (just as the written words act as a key to one's idea =
and the world can now access the power of one's idea).
=C2=A0
When you chan=
t a mantra silently, you are hiding your shakti with the mantra from the wo=
rld. When you chant a mantra loud, you are sharing your shakti with the man=
tra with the world. Some of it can be wasted and some of it can be tapped b=
y someone.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
If leaves, flowers and fruits are p=
lucked from a small plant, it will not grow and it will die. Similarly, one=
's shakti with a mantra will not grow if one keeps saying that mantra loud =
now and then. As one keeps chanting a mantra silently, while maintaining so=
me yama and niyama, one will slowly accumulate shakti with it.
=C2=A0
If yo=
u do not intend to accumulate shakti with any mantra, that is fine too.. Th=
at is NOT an impediment to self-purification and self-realization. However,=
 certain tasks in this dual world require an accumulation of enough shakti =
with a mantra. If one's guru wants one to do something in future and asks o=
ne to accumulate shakti with a specific mantra, one has to do it.
=C2=A0
*=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=

Manish's guru was a realized man. His name was Nakhat=
e Maharaj. He was a Bhadra Kaali worshipper. He was blessed by a darshan of=
 Bhadra Kaali and went into nirvikalpa samadhi at the age of 21 years. He r=
emained in nirvikalpa samadhi for 7 days and returned to the dual world to =
perform the tasks assigned to him, as a detached actor.
=C2=A0
Even a reali=
zed man like him did not utter some mantras audibly. For example, when he g=
ave a specific mantra to Manish, the means he employed were quite old-fashi=
oned. He did not say the mantra in Manish's ear. Instead, he asked Manish t=
o sit down with closed eyes and placed his thumbs on Manish's temples. He a=
sked Manish to focus and then he also focused. Manish saw a mantra in Devan=
agari script in letters made of fire. He remembered what he saw and did sad=
hana with that mantra.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
These methods are used =
for a purpose and not out of selfishness. There are two main reasons:
=C2=
=A0
(1) You want to keep the shakti you accumulated with that mantra, becau=
se there is a purpose for it. Giving is great, but giving indiscriminately =
is unwise. When one can do finite tasks, one has to optimize what one does.=

(2) Nothing that comes too easy lasts. If one gets a million bucks easily,=
 one can waste it. Instead of giving million dollars to someone, it will be=
 better if you teach one how to work hard and make money.
=C2=A0
Sharing va=
rious thoughts and spiritual truths and inspiring people to do sadhana=C2=
=A0is one thing and sharing one's accumulated shakti with a mantra with peo=
ple another.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=

=C2=A0
As I mentioned Nakhate Maharaj, =
I want to mention a small story about him.
=C2=A0
When Nakhate Maharaj left=
 this world, his sishyas had an interesting experience. Manish was in UK me=
ditating at that time. He suddenly felt that his guru was in front of him. =
He opened his eyes and saw that Nakhate Maharaj was standing in front of hi=
m physically. He held his palm up in the blessing pose. Then he waved his h=
and as if saying good bye. Then he disappeared. When Manish called India la=
ter, he found out that Nakhate Maharaj left his body at the same time in In=
dia. He also found out that his other sishyas too had the same experience i=
n different parts of the world around the same time.

Dear Narasimha, namaste & pranaams
=C2=A0
Please forgive me if I am s=
een to be impertinent in my question based on the lines in bold below.
=C2=
=A0
Why must the Guru upadesa be kept secret and not shared with anyone who=
 might benefit? More the so if it is a prasiddha mantra? Think of Ramanujac=
harya, who after receiving the astakshari from his Guru, shouted the mantra=
 from the rooftop to all and thus the world was benefited. The same way, ha=
ve we not benefited when the rishis generously shared their knowledge of Br=
ahman?
=C2=A0
I can understand it if the mantra/prayer is customized for an=
 individual according to the capacity of the person.
=C2=A0
best regards
Ha=

It is what you wrote, but w=
ith some minor correction. I can record other mantras in my voice and share=
 with all, but instructed to not give Savitur Gayatri mantra in my voice to=
 anyone. It is my spiritual food. Most of my spiritual experiences came wit=
h this mantra and I need this mantra for more things in future. So I keep i=
t to myself and do not share it with all.
=C2=A0
But many people in your ci=
ty should be able to teach you this mantra with correct pronunciation. By t=
he way, I think you live in Chennai. If so, please try to meet Swami Sathas=
ivom at Kalikambal temple on Thambuchetty Street near Central station. He b=
elongs to a rare class of priests who are fast becoming extinct in this com=
mercial age. If possible, meet him and take his blessings.
=C2=A0
My intuit=
ion tells me that you are a man made for karma yoga rather than meditation =
and veda mantras. Surrender to your chosen deity, see that deity in all peo=
ple and serve people around you. See god in all people. If possible, think =
of starting a small movement in the slums of Chennai (or wherever you live)=
. Go, serve people there, help them to the best of your ability and teach t=
hem about god. After helping them materially first, then teach them to chan=
t god's name when they have a few minutes of time. In my opinion, this is t=
he right path for you.
=C2=A0
Actions performed with ego, pride and attachm=
ent bind one. Actions without ego, pride and attachment liberate one. Pleas=
e perform big acts of social service and yet without any pride or attachmen=
t. Do not be upset with a few failures in the beginning (upset comes with a=
ttachment. A detached person is not upset if his sincere actions do not giv=
e the intended result) and keep trying calmly. Sincere and detached action =
never fails in the long run. Start slowly.

Narasimha

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>It is what yo=
u wrote, but with some minor correction. I can record other mantras in my v=

eriences came with this mantra and I need this mantra for more things in fu=

<DIV><FONT face=3DAri=

antra with correct pronunciation. By the way, I think you live in Chennai. =
If so, please try to meet Swami Sathasivom at Kalikambal temple on Thambuch=
etty Street near Central station. He belongs to a rare class of priests who=
 are fast becoming extinct in this commercial age. If possible, meet him an=

<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>My intuition tells me that yo=
u are a man made for karma yoga rather than meditation and veda mantras. Su=
rrender to your chosen deity, see that deity in all people and serve people=
 around you. See god in all people. If possible, think of starting a small =
movement in the slums of Chennai (or wherever you live). Go, serve people t=
here, help them to the best of your ability and teach them about god. After=
 helping them materially first, then teach them to chant god's name when th=
ey have a few minutes of time. In my opinion, this is the right path for yo=
u.</FONT></DIV>
