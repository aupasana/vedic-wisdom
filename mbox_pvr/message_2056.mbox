Namaste Narasimha,
=A0
Thanks for your thorough reply to what was a quite u=
nfocused original post.Granted, I employed a non-standard usage of the term=
 Aatman, which may be traced to my having seen a documentary on the Kumbh M=
ela festival called "Shortcut to Nirvana" wherein the Dalai Lama, in one of=
 his speeches, was making a distinction between Aatman and Anaatman theory,=
 relating to the former to Hinduism and the latter to his own practice. His=
 message was one of unity, maintaining that Hinduism and Buddhism should pe=
acefully coexist and collaborate. Tibetan Buddhism and Hinduism have many s=
imilarities, which I will not get into now, but in my post I was trying to =
work towards an understanding of how the cycle of war/urbanization/chaotic =
vice may be effected=A0by world religion. Obviously, this is a very ambitio=
us topic for a message board, but one worthy of exploration in some context=
.
=A0
Just as Christianity must answer for the crusades, there are some thi=
ngs for which both Hinduism and Buddhism must answer, first on the practica=
l plane of world suffering, and secondly on the theoretical plane of abstra=
ct causality. Himmler's having carried around a copy of the Bhagavad Gita, =
Oppenheimer's affinity with the same, and the Nazi interest in the religion=
 of Tibet and Buddhism ... these are all things which are not commonly delv=
ed into by academics or mainstream historians due to the their decidedly my=
stical bent, and their suggestion of a particular brand of amorality which =
is rarely assimilated into Western thought, let alone media. The confusion =
over the relationship between the practical causes of world suffering and t=
he religious texts and themes which seem to crop up in their midst is=A0suc=
h a vast and daunting object of study, that there is no easy means of appro=
ach to it. The concept of karmic rnanubhanda provides a seemingly
 convenie=
nt handle, but it would be exhausting to apply this thoroughly to an unders=
tanding of the afore-mentioned cycle of suffering. 
=A0
When looking at the=
 vast field of what may be called, for lack of a better term, death cult af=
finities, throughout the world, it seems logical to consider what role vari=
ous world religions play in the negative conditioning patterns which govern=
 global consciousness. But the idea which seems to me most compelling is th=
at this all is a result of imbalance between Shaivic and Shaktic energies. =
And I was suggesting that the very notion of Buddhism, itself, stemming fro=
m the legend of the Buddha leaving his home, is based on an unbalanced foun=
dation. Of course, this would also be tantamount to suggesting that Buddha =
was not a Vishnu incarnation. But all such speculation is perhaps irrelevan=
t, in that many buddhists, not to mention Hindus,=A0would not admit of such=
 a relation in the first place. =A0It is not unreasonable to consider that =
all suffering is the direct result of the misuse of shakti, caused by the o=
verreaching of the ego. A purely balanced
 management of sexual energy, whi=
ch tantra prescribes, would seem to cure the problem, as long as it could b=
e maintained. I was also, in my original post, implying that the perpetuato=
rs of the cyclic=A0 intoxication/sex/death habit were all worshippers of Ka=
li, but poor worshippers, and poor managers of shakti, because they burn ou=
t fast, and leave a trail of more suffering behind them. Kali is the highes=
t goddess they can conceive of, the Destroyer, so they sacrifice to her. Yo=
u mention that they are not Aghoris. I would say that it is a question of s=
emantics, in that everyone is an Aghori, just some are more successful at i=
t than others.
=A0
Any religion or practice which does not offer a life-aff=
irming balance between Shaivic and Shaktic energies will conjure some godde=
ss to be its symbol. In the collective unconscious we have already been giv=
en the paradisiacal symbols of the Garden of Eden, the embrace of Radha/Kri=
shna and the mountain-top reveries of Shiva/Parvati. To descend from these =
visions into any other view appears pathological, and asking for trouble. T=
his was the essence of my post.
=A0
Thanks,

Namaste Jeff,
=A0
Welcome to the group!
=A0
It is interesting tha=
t each one of us comes with a different world view based on all the literat=
ure and thinking one has been exposed to and the life experiences. It seems=
 to me like you have a unique background.
=A0
Though I always insist that d=
irect experience is far more important than theoretical discussions, it is =
useful to discuss sometimes.
=A0
My background is mainly in vedanta and san=
atana dharma and not in Buddhism. I will comment on your post based on MY u=
nderstanding of what your background is and what you are saying. Your mail =
is quite loaded and I will respond only to some salient points in a freewhe=
eling manner.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
My wo=
rld view is slightly different. Aatman is that which is in ALL beings and t=
hings as the non-dual and permanent reality. But we do not perceive Aatman =
and perceive only the objects of the dual world, which are impermanent. How=
ever, the impermanent objects of this dual world too are made of Aatman and=
 non-different from Aatman. They do not consist of "anaatman" (non-aatman) =
, but aatman only. Let me give an analogy.
=A0
A ripple in the pond is also=
 part of pond and not non-pond. While the pond is stationary and permanent,=
 the ripple is moving and transient. It will vanish after a while and merge=
 in the stationary pond. Some ripples die away too fast and some take a ver=
y long time. Some transform from one structure to another before they vanis=
h. But each ripple vanishes eventually and the pond remains in the place wh=
ere there was a ripple once. As a matter of fact, even when the ripple exis=
ted, one can still view it as the pond and not as a ripple.
=A0
Aatman or B=
rahman described by Veda and Upanishad is like the pond. All beings of the =
dual world that are perceivable to us are like the ripples in the pond. The=
y arise, they move, they get transformed into different shapes, they intera=
ct with each other and get disturbed by each other and eventually they slow=
 down and vanish.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
T=
hus, we do not talk in terms of aatman and anaatman (non-aatman) . We consi=
der everything as aatman. However, some parts of imperishable aatman seem p=
erishable because of our way of looking, when our perspective is limited by=
 duality.
=A0
The preservational and destructive aspects are both part of d=
uality and non-dual aatman is free from all such considerations. Nothing is=
 created or preserved or destroyed in aatman. But, when one looks from a pe=
rspective that is limited by duality, it seems like there are objects being=
 created, preserved and destroyed.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
One gets liberation or moksha when one's perspective is not=
 limited by the duality. Even when stuck in a ripple that feels like a viol=
ent whirlpool, if one can think "I am the pond" and act like it, then one i=
s liberated. If a ripple is going to come hit the ripple one is in and dist=
urb one's stability, if one can still think "I am the pond" and act like it=
, then one is liberated. Of course, I am talking in terms of the analogy I =
introduced earlier.
=A0
When one is not liberated and one's perspective is =
clouded by duality, one experiences happiness, sadness, love, lust, hatred,=
 anger, jealosy etc and various emotions. When one is liberated and one's p=
erspective is not limited by duality, one is filled with great bliss. This =
was the goal of Buddha as well as Vedic rishis.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 =
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Though rishis declared that everything is Aatm=
an and inability to recognize it is due to one's perspective being limited =
by duality, they did not leave it at that. They did not say "this duality i=
s nonsense or delusion or magic or anaatman. Just get over it", because get=
ting over it is not easy. For one stuck in a whirlpool in a pond and panick=
ing, the mere preaching "ignore the whirlpool and think of the pond" is use=
less.
=A0
They prescribed various paths that are appropriate for people of =
various backgrounds to slowly get over duality. In fact, for people who do =
not want to get over duality and want to remain in it, manipulate it to the=
ir [temporary] advantage and enjoy it also, they prescribed various paths.
=
=A0
The respect rishis showed to both non-dual Aatman AND the field of dual=
ity is perhaps unique to sanatana dharma and perhaps missing in Buddhism.
=
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Aghora is not meant=
 to be a path of addition to sex or drugs or pain. It is the path of seeing=
 Aatman even in depraving conditions. If an aghori's focus of mind wavers f=
rom the chosen deity and becomes aware of the body or its sense inputs, the=
n he has failed badly. Only a sadhaka with a very high level of purity alre=
ady is capable of testing himself/herself in depraving conditions and see i=
f they disturb the mental focus on god. As Svoboda correctly points out at =
the beginning of his book on Aghora, the sadhakas who are pure enough to su=
cceed in Aghora practices usually are not attracted to Aghora and those who=
 find the practices attractive are usually not pure enough to succeed in th=
em.
=A0
However, we cannot equate goddess worship to aghora. Aghora is a se=
t of extreme practices. Goddess worship has a wide range of practices in In=
dia. Some worship the goddess without any "self-destruction" or even self-d=
eprivation and pursue rank materialism along with goddess worship. Some wor=
ship goddess with varying levels of self-deprivation aimed at slowly limiti=
ng the influence of sense inputs and considerations of sense pleasures/pain=
s on the ability of the mind to focus on the Divine. Sanatana dharma has a =
wide variety of practices that are appropriate for people of various level =
of spiritual evolution and various degrees of internal purity.
=A0
*=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
But, given the wide variety of=
 teachings and practices available, people sometimes lap up the wrong teach=
ings for them. For example, one person may claim "I am Brahman, I am imperi=
shable aatman, I am Buddha and I have to do no sadhana". A pretension or a =
mere academic statement is not a substitute for an internal *realization* .=
 If a terrible strife befalls, like a slow and painful death or a debilitat=
ing disease or terrible injury, one may start saying "I am in great pain". =
Well, if one is Brahman, there is no pain or pleasure.
=A0
One should reali=
ze that teachings relating to non-duality are inapplicable to most people a=
nd they need to do some sadhana to wade the field duality and reach non-dua=
lity. In this light, we must appreciate the respectful treatment of duality=
 by rishis (who themselves had overcome it completely) and their teaching o=
f many tools to slowly wade it.
=A0

Narasimha

> Namaste,

> I recently joined this group after having been forwarded=
 some interesting posts by a colleague. As an introductory post, I would li=
ke to address a theme that is most pressing in my current worldview, namely=
 the problem of reconciling the preservational aspect of Atman with what ap=
pears to be the dominance of a dark embrace between Anatman theory and the =
Aghori path throughout most of the world. I don't think this is as simple a=
s recongnizing that Shaivic and Vishnaivic energies are held in constant ba=
lance, because the focus of the argument seems more oriented toward an almo=
st unconscious Kali worship among parts of the world in which Buddhism is p=
lanting or has planted roots. 
> 
> For some time I have struggled with the=
 unsettling suspicion that Buddhism is a terrible trap for the mind to stum=
ble upon. Ever since I heard a clip of U.G. Krishnamurti saying that Buddhi=
sm introduced the concept of conversion into the world, and perhaps before,=
 I have been plagued by this suspicion. It appears that Anatman theory mere=
ly creates a a playground for various forms of absurdity which manifest the=
mselves as a culture's obsession with sex and death, which result in the ec=
onomy of many parts of the world being driven by war and prostitution. 
> 
=
> Now the Aghori path is what is is for most people: a path of self-destruc=
tion which is also a form of Goddess worship. But I would maintain that suc=
h naive practitioners of this path have used, consciously or unconsciously,=
 the prevalent Anatman-related theories as excuses to perpetuate the endles=
s cycle of imperialism, heroin-trafficking and prostitution that generally =
drives world economy. Because of this fatal misunderstanding of Shaivic ene=
rgies, along with the corresponding fascination with the lingo of Anatman t=
heory, most of the world has become a wasteland of dispersed energy, premat=
urely sacrificed to Kali without a shred of taste or sophistication. 
>

It is here that I suppose one could get into some kind of nirvikalpa/savika=
lp a samadhi debate regarding whether the Buddha, by renouncing his family,=
 actually created the disintegration of focus which is symbolic of the stat=
e of the world, in that Atman theory, represented by Hinduism is left holdi=
ng down the homestead while Anatman theory actually creates suffering by at=
tempting to remove it through meditation. I would submit that the current s=
tate of world dharma locked in some kind of identity crisis over who is sup=
posed to be holding Kali's left leg and who the right. This is the essentia=
l problem, Shiva just lay there.

wavers from the chosen deity and becomes aware of the body or its sense inp=
uts, then he has failed badly. Only a sadhaka with a very high level of pur=
ity already is capable of testing himself/herself in depraving conditions a=
nd see if they disturb the mental focus on god. As Svoboda correctly points=
 out at the beginning of his book on Aghora, the sadhakas who are pure enou=

hose who find the practices attractive are usually not pure enough to succe=
ed in them.<BR> <BR>However, we cannot equate goddess worship to aghor=
a. Aghora is a set of extreme practices.
 Goddess worship has a wide range =
of practices in India. Some worship the goddess without any "self-destructi=
on" or even self-deprivation and pursue rank materialism along with goddess=
 worship. Some worship goddess with varying levels of self-deprivation aime=
d at slowly limiting the influence of sense inputs and considerations of se=
nse pleasures/pains on the ability of the mind to focus on the Divine. Sana=
tana dharma has a wide variety of practices that are appropriate for people=
 of various level of spiritual evolution and various degrees of internal pu=
rity.<BR> <BR>*        *  =
;      *<BR> <BR>But, given the wide variety =
of teachings and practices available, people sometimes lap up the wrong tea=
chings for them. For example, one person may claim "I am Brahman, I am impe=
rishable aatman, I am Buddha and I have to do no sadhana". A pretension or =
a mere academic statement is not a
 substitute for an internal *realization=
* . If a terrible strife befalls, like a slow and painful death or a debili=
tating disease or terrible injury, one may start saying "I am in great pain=
". Well, if one is Brahman, there is no pain or pleasure.<BR> <BR>One =
should realize that teachings relating to non-duality are inapplicable to m=
ost people and they need to do some sadhana to wade the field duality and r=
each non-duality. In this light, we must appreciate the respectful treatmen=
t of duality by rishis (who themselves had overcome it completely) and thei=
r teaching of many tools to slowly wade it.<BR> <BR>Best regards,<BR>N=

Namaste,<BR>> <BR>> I recently joined this group after having been fo=

 namely the problem of reconciling the preservational aspect of Atman with =
what appears to be the dominance of a dark embrace between Anatman theory a=
nd the Aghori path throughout most of the world. I don't think this is as s=
imple as recongnizing that Shaivic and Vishnaivic energies are held in cons=

an almost
 unconscious Kali worship among parts of the world in which Buddh=

 excuses to perpetuate the endless cycle of imperialism, heroin-trafficking=
