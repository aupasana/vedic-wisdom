Dear Ajit,
 
There may be paaThaantaras. Both versions make sense to me, though "tu" seems a bit forced there.
 
For others, tvadharma = tu + adharma. It means one who destroys the path of adharma.
 
*        *        *
 
There are many ways in which I can make sense of "svadharma-maarga-naashanam":
 
(1) The word "maarga" not only means "path", but also means "search for something". Thus the whole expression can mean "one who brings to an end the search for swadharma", i.e. one who clearly shows what one's dharma is.
 
(2) The word "maarga" not only means the path you follow, but the track you leave behind. So the whole expression can mean "one who erases the [kaarmik] track left behind by following one's dharma". This fits well with the next line which says "karma-paasha-mocakam", i.e. one who liberates from the chain of actions-and-reactions.
 
(3) The previous term is "dharma-setu-paalakam" and it means "one who rules the bridge of dharma". If this samsaara (material world) is like an ocean, dharma is like a bridge that lets one cross the ocean without sinking. However, this is not a 1 mile or 2 mile long bridge. The ocean is infinite and so is the bridge. One can follow one's dharma forever and yet not reach the end, i.e. be liberated. At some stage, the idea that I am so and so and my dharma is so and so needs to be given up. Of course, this cannot happen forcibly. Giving up swadharma forcefully when one still has self-identification is not moksha, but adharma. However, when one is ready for liberation, one can give up the ideas of self and own dharma and become like a dry leaf being blown here and there by the air. Thus, this expression can mean "one who makes one overcome the concepts of self, dharma etc and liberates one".
 
*        *        *
 
Aadi Shankara may have strategically used some expressions to convery several shades of the meaning simultaneously. This Kaala Bhiaravaashtakam is one of the most beautiful compositions by the master philosopher-scholar-teacher-poet.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
