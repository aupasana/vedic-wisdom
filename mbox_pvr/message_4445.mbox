Namaste,
 
Priests offer samidhas (twigs) symbolizing different samskaras. =
There is nothing wrong in offering dry coconut pieces instead.
 
The most i=
mportant part of upanayanam is the brahmopadesa, i.e. teaching of the Gayat=
ri mantra. All other things are secondary. For example, many priests re-ena=
ct all the rituals that were supposed to be done since birth (e.g. naming, =
first feeding, first shaving etc), just in case those samskaras were skippe=
d earlier. One can wonder if that is really necessary and whether it has an=
y real impact on one's spiritual evolution.
 
There is also a lot of fake d=
rama enacted. The young person and his father repeat things in Sanskrit tha=
t are told by the priest. Those who know Sanskrit will see that the young m=
an says he is going to go to Kashi and learn Veda etc. He says he will live=
 by begging alms from now on. He even practices it by asking all attendees =
for alms. There is a lot of entertaining drama. Of course, most boys gettin=
g upanayanam do not really intend to leave parents, go to Kashi to learn Ve=
da and do not really plan to live by begging! A lot of things they say are =
simply lies, done just for fun and to enact a drama based on how things cou=
ld have been in old days!
 
*        *        *
 
Put bluntly, being given =
a mantra by a guru is essentially a spiritual event and not a social event =
or a party, though upanayanam has transformed from a spiritual event into a=
 social event. All you really need is the young man and his guru sitting in=
 one place and the mantra being taught. You don't need a big crowd.
 
Of co=
urse, one may say that a big crowd is needed to come and give blessings, bu=
t "blessings" are a misunderstood and overrated concept. For someone to giv=
e you blessings that do some good to you, the person should have something =
in his karmik account and the ability to transfer it to you. Most of the ti=
mes, blessings given by people in our society are a mere formality and mean=
 nothing, like checks that have "void - this is not a real check" printed o=
n them.
 
Instead of hundred people with various levels of interest in the =
goings on visiting the function out of social compulsion and watching possi=
bly with boredom, an ideal setup for an upanayanam is just the sishya and g=
uru and some sadhakas related to them who have done sadhana and wish the yo=
ung man well.
 
*        *        *
 
If you ask me, the most important thi=
ng is this. The person who is transmitting the Gayatri mantra (usually fath=
er) should intensify his spiritual sadhana, especially with Gayatri mantra,=
 in the months before upanayanam. If possible, keep brahmacharya for a few =
months and chant Gayatri mantra for an hour or two everyday. During that ti=
me, he should never say Gayatri mantra out loud.
 
When he transmits the ma=
ntra, he should ensure that only the young man hears it and nobody else doe=
s (i.e. no dilution in the transmitted energy). The custom is to say it in =
the ear while a cloth covers both, but that only *symbolizes* secretiveness=
 and may not really *ensure* secretiveness. If everybody (especially the pr=
iest) is sitting close to them, they may also hear it in spite of a the clo=
th covering them.
 
When I did upanayanam to my son, we did the rituals in =
open air in our back yard. At the time of brahmopadesa muhurta, I took my s=
on inside the pooja room where I did my sadhana. I did not allow anybody, i=
ncluding the priests, to come there. I taught the mantra to my son in an lo=
w, but audible, voice. I repeated a few times, made him repeat it a few tim=
es, ensured his pronunciation was correct, and then both of us did a maalaa=
 (108 times meditation) with it silently. We then came back to the backyard=
 and the rituals continued.
 
One more thing on muhurta: If you got a muhur=
ta from an astrologer you trust and want to follow it, please ensure that G=
ayatri mantra is taught at that muhurta. THAT is the main event. Some pries=
ts put a paste made of cumin seeds and jaggery on the young man's head at t=
he muhurta time. That is irrelevant and brahmopadesa is the main thing.
 
*=
        *        *
 
Though we did a detailed ritual for my son's upanayana=
m, my own upanayanam was a very simple affair. Though my father is an ortho=
dox braahmana following a very simple and austere lifestyle, he is unorthod=
ox in the matter of rituals. Above all, he fearlessly follows his convictio=
ns and does not engage in rituals that he does not consider meaningful. He =
is also against following the letter of the rules and breaking the spirit. =
For example, when he went to a griha pravesh (housewarming) ceremony once, =
they were beating a cow to force it to climb stairs to enter the room. Peop=
le bring a cow into the room at the time of housewarming, as they consider =
a cow to symbolize Lakshmi and some steps in the ritual require a cow in th=
e room. As the cow was not happy to climb stairs, they resorted to violence=
 to force it. My father was sad to see the suffering of the cow and told th=
em bluntly that they were doing adharma and there was no point in getting a=
 cow in the room like that. But my father puts more value on the spirit of =
the rules rather than the letter and does not hesitate to speak his mind in=
 front of anybody.
 
For my upanayanam, he took me to Lord Venkateswara tem=
ple in Tirupati/Tirumala, which is his favorite temple. At the time of muhu=
rta, we were on the hill near the temple. He spent a few hours doing his ja=
pam with various stotras and I also did japam with several stotras. When th=
e muhurta came, he simply taught me Gayatri mantra and that was it. No ritu=
als of any kind were performed, except for japam for a few hours.
 
In my o=
pinion, such a simple approach is also perfectly fine. The key points are t=
hat the person giving mantra should have done some sadhana, both of them sh=
ould be in a good and relaxed mood at the time and environment should be pe=
aceful, and, the person receiving mantra should do a lot of sadhana with it=
 later on.
 
If a businessman opens an account in his son's name for a new =
business venture by the young man, what matters is how much money father ga=
ve and how well the son used the money, how he ran the new business and how=
 he grew the money. How big a party was held, how many people came and what=
 activities they engaged in is irrelevant in the long run.
 
*        *    =
    *
 
My purpose is not to discourage elaborate rituals. Do them if there=
 is social pressure to do so or you find them interesting. But, atleast ens=
ure that mantropadesa happens peacefully and correctly. More importantly, e=
nsure that the young man does some sadhana with Gayatri mantra everyday, af=
ter upanayanam.
 
Also, it is perfectly acceptable (and beneficial) to init=
iate the young person into homam after upanayanam is done. On the same day =
or a few days later, one can teach a simple version of Ganapathi homam and =
let the young person perform it by oneself during weekends or so. One can s=
tart off with the super-short procedure and slowly add things. Doing Gayatr=
i mantra everyday and homam now and then will accelerate the spiritual evol=
ution of the young person.

Narasimha
