Namaste Kris and others,

Please tolerate some more freewheeling comments from me.

Rishis were very open-minded and had a perfectly integrated knowledge of all 
aspects of the Unlimited (Brahman, non-dual Supreme Self) as well the 
Limited (Maya, i.e. manifestation of Brahman as the dual world). They 
understood Brahman as well as Maya and had mastery over both domains.

We are now in Kali Yuga and it is inevitable that biases, narrow-mindedness 
and posturing enter the mindsets of many learned.

As long as one is living the dual reality, the duality enters all things. 
Polarization is the very nature of duality. Good and bad, beautiful and 
ugly, powerful and weak, learned and ignorant - all these seemingly opposite 
polarities are a creation of the duality. Even when it comes to spiritual 
progress and reaching god, there are polarities. There are seemingly 
opposing paths. One scripture says one thing and another says the opposite. 
One may take one word of one scripture as the ultimate Truth and another may 
take another word of another scripture as the ultimate Truth. Unfortunately, 
all the knowledge we get from books, gurus etc is still in the domain of 
duality and not free from the phenomenon of opposites.

The only solution is to be firmly established in the non-dual Supreme Self 
at all times and see each thing in the dual world for what it truly is, i.e. 
yet another manifestation of the very same non-dual Self.

Such a state was achieved by so many rishis in the past. In this age, 
however, such rishis are so rare. No wonder there is too much posturing and 
disagreement.

Yes, there were (and are) those who experienced both. However, there are 
some who reject one of the two in favor of the other. Actually, one would be 
most fortunate to reach either state.

If you look at the "star in the sky" analogy I gave earlier, you will see 
different goals in Dwaita, Visishtadwaita and Adwaita paths. Some people 
following one approach do not entertain notions corresponding to another 
approach. However, some take them as diferent stops in the same journey.

*        *        *

I just want to make one more comment that is not directly relevant to the 
discussion, but touches it on the periphery. May those who find my views and 
analogies silly kindly ignore me.

Hard-core Adwaitis are essentially Vedantis and jnaana (gyaana) yogis. This 
path is appropriate for someone who is already quite evolved. If one is too 
deeply sunk in the delusion of this dual world appearance, it is a difficult 
path. It is like telling someone who wants to reach the sky, "you are 
already in the sky. Just realize it and be done". The poor guy is very much 
on earth and can by no means "realize" that he is "already in the sky".

One who is rooted on earth and wants to reach the sky needs to engage in 
some actions that elevate one and prepare one for reaching the sky. Various 
tantras and rituals help in that. These are more appropriate for many people 
than the path of Adwaita, jnaana yoga and contemplation.

However, if one gets too involved in building tall structures on earth, one 
may find it interesting and keep on building taller and taller structures 
and forget the ultimate goal of finally reaching the sky. Building tall 
structures will help one rise from earth, but not help one reach the sky. 
However tall a building one builds, it will still not take one to the sky. 
Reaching the sky is not about building tall buildings. Books and gurus can 
teach one how to build tall structures, but the final leap into the sky is 
untaught.

In the analogy I am talking about here, Adwaitic self-realization is akin to 
reaching the sky. Normal state of a person is akin to being on earth. 
Building tall structures on earth is akin to engaging in various tantras, 
rituals and practices to progress spiritually.

By engaging in more and more practices, one may experience more and more 
things and get some siddhis etc. This is akin to building tall structures 
and climbing them. Even as one builds tall structures, the final goal of 
reaching the sky should be at the back of one's mind. Otherwise, one can get 
lost in the practices and not reach the final goal.

There is no fool-proof approach to have an Adwaitic self-realization. Even 
as one engages in various practices, one should keep the final goal at the 
back of mind. That is why I recommend reading Vedanta works like "Yoga 
Vaasishtham" and various Upanishats and keeping the high philosophy at the 
back of mind even while engaging in various practices.

Enough for today..

Best regards,
Narasimha
