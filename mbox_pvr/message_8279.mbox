      Hi,
=C2=A0
Don't worry about bother=
ing me and ask such questions when you have them.
=C2=A0
As this reply can =
be useful to other people also, I am cc'ing it to the vedic-wisdom yahoogro=
up. I am doing it without revealing your identity.

> mindfully in the deed?&enjoy it,he went only for a reaso=
n he is not the karman,atma
> cannot be polluted,realising this sankara wen=
t to the queen&thus he is still as sacred
> as ever?
=C2=A0
Though correct,=
 this is a dangerous notion for most people. True, atma cannot be poluted a=
nd is beyond desires and actions. But most people do not identify with atma=
. They
 identify with a perishable body. So all the talk of "all is atma an=
d atma is pure" is just theory.
=C2=A0
Atma is like an ocean in which waves=
 and rippes arise and move. Ocean does not get shattered when ripples hit e=
ach other and stays the same. But bodies, minds and other perishable object=
s arising in atma are like waves and ripples arising and moving in ocean. T=
hey increase, decrease, get shattered etc. One identifying with the ocean o=
f atma is beyond happiness and sadness. One identifying with the ripple of =
a body will experience happiness, sadness etc.
=C2=A0
Suppose one is watchi=
ng a movie and knows that it is not real and just a movie. Still, when a re=
ally scary scene comes, one may be startled. Mere intellectual understandin=
g that it is not real and just a movie, is not enough. It has to be ingrain=
ed fully in one's instincts. Similarly, intellectually knowing that all thi=
s is a play and not real, is not enough. When some really
 pleasurable and =
painful event happens, one WILL identify with the body and experience somet=
hing.
=C2=A0
If Shankara was fully enlightened before that episode (we don'=
t know that for sure), then the action would not have bound him. Otherwise,=
 it would've created a rina. If he experienced some pleasure, he would crea=
te a new rina to the queen, to various deities (!) who live within one's co=
nsciousness and operate various parts of one's body and mind, and to variou=
s beings in his virya who may have been significantly affected. He would ha=
ve to pay those debts back later.

=C2=A0
There is not=
hing absolutely sacred or dirty about any action. It is the intent and atti=
tude of the actor that makes an action sacred or dirty. Self-centered actio=
ns are more dirty than selfless actions geared at others. More so, the dens=
er and more selfish one's
 conditioning.

=C2=A0
Only st=
ill ocean does not have any ripples or their movement. Similarly only umman=
ifest atma (Self after dissolution/pralaya and before new srishti/creation)=
 does not have any objects and actions within it. Atma during a srishti cyc=
le does have many objects within it and many actions between them.
=C2=A0
T=
hus, realizing Self does NOT mean sitting still in a forest and doing nothi=
ng. Various bodies keep doing various actions. A realized person identifies=
 with atma and actions by various people seem to him/her like his/her actio=
ns. One does not particularly identify with what one's old body specificall=
y does (based on previous momentum).
=C2=A0
Nature uses
 such realized peop=
le to set good examples for the world. So they do engage in some actions. T=
hey have no pride or shame, no happiness or sadness and do whatever spontan=
eously occurs to them.
=C2=A0
Shankara performing last rites for mother wou=
ld've made Mother happy. Moreover, it would set an example for future. One'=
s interaction with the world is give & take. We give things to others and t=
ake things from them. True renunciation is in renouncing what we take. Ther=
e is no need to renounce giving. As the prevant notion of sannyasa was to c=
ut off from the world, Shankara demonstrated giving others (e.g. mother) sa=
nnyasa.
=C2=A0
Swami Vivekananda and Swami Sivananda took this further. The=
y engaged in a lot of service for the society, unlike other sannyasis who l=
ock themselves in isolation.
=C2=A0
Of course, if the act of "giving" incre=
ases pride (i.e. you are "taking" something in return of what you are givin=
g!!!), then a sannyasi
 better isolate oneself from the world and neither g=
ive nor take (except absolute essentials for survival). But, when one progr=
esses beyond some level, it is a good idea to "give" what one is in a posit=
ion to give others.
=C2=A0
The purpose of life is to give and not to take, =
though some taking is unavoidable in the process of giving. Focus on what y=
ou give and not on what you take.

=C2=A0
> can one a=
chieve moksha still in family life
=C2=A0
Yes.
=C2=A0
You are still not old=
 enough. Focus on your studies for the next 3-4 years. But, eventually, you=
 can read "Yoga Vasishtham".

> still iam in=
 silly thoughts....ya can man controll his thoughts100%?]
=C2=A0
Various go=
od and bad thoughts come to mind
 continuously, for it is the nature of min=
d! As long as one is alive, the force that runs one's existence creates tho=
ughts in the mind. This force is based on the momentum from various notions=
 one was exposed to and various desires one entertained, during various liv=
es. It is called "mental conditioning".
=C2=A0
Can it be controlled? Yes, i=
n the sense that one can add new notions and new desires to this driving fo=
rce and the its direction can be slowly refined over time.
=C2=A0
Mind is t=
he problem and mind is the key to the solution as well. Use mind to change =
the direction of mind.
=C2=A0
I don't know about 100%, but I do not know on=
e can modify one's thinking over time.
=C2=A0

Narasimha
