Namaste freinds,
=A0
A friend who does homam asked: "One of the things that=
 I find tricky is count of mantras, I find it difficult to keep count.
Any =
suggestions from your side will help."
=A0
The same question was asked by a=
 few other people in the past. Here are my 2 cents.
=A0
Keeping an "auspici=
ous number" as the final count is not that important. The suggested targets=
 in shastras (4, 8, 12, 28, 108 etc) are just for guidance. You can do any =
number of times. Instead of the count weighing on your mind and disturbing =
your focus, it is better to do as many times as you can, with better focus.=

=A0
I'd even recommend deciding how long you can do it, keep an alarm next=
 to you and then keep making offerings until alarm rings. In this age, I am=
 in favor of measuring in terms of time rather than mantra counts. Even at =
temples, I see people hurrying things because they have count targets to me=
et and have time pressures (e.g. Sri Sooktam 16 times, Rudram 11 times etc)=
. Instead of doing 16 times in a hurry, it is better to do 6 or 7 times slo=
wly and while fully enjoying it. If you have 25 minutes, do it for 25 minut=
es and as many times as possible in those 25 minutes, without hurrying thin=
gs or making them artificial.
=A0
In my daily homam as
 well as japam, I do=
 not follow any fixed counts. In homam, I do my mantra as many times as I f=
eel like it. For japam, I put an alarm after certain time and meditate unti=
l alarm rings, without counting.
=A0
When I must count in homam, I make off=
erings in fixed positions and use that for counting. For example, I start i=
n east and go till northeast clockwise, covering each corner, then make an =
offering in the middle and that makes it 9 offerings. I then do the same in=
 reverse order and that makes it 18. Three/six such cycles make 54/108. Thi=
s is a simple method to keep count with very little mental overhead and, at=
 the same time, to keep fire going in all corners. If I need 28, it is 3x9+=
1. However, it is best to not count and do as many times as you can.
=A0
Ju=
st my 2 cents and do as you feel appropriate and applicable in your case!

=
=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha
