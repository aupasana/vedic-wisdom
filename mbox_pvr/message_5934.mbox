Dear All,

Without an iota of doubt, a full water-filled coconut has the be=
st effect in a 
homa. If that can be given in the fire, nothing like it! Le=
t me elaborate a bit 
more on the last portion of the below mail.

Normally=
 we do a homa in a homa kunda which is placed on the floor. The gap - 
phys=
ical distance - between the person doing the homa and the kunda is not too =

big. In such circumstances it is good to be a little cautious while giving=
 a 
full coconut. 


=C2=A0If someone has a fire pit dug, or the homa-kunda=
 base is resonably=C2=A0below the 
surface level where one is sitting, that=
 is ideal for giving a coconut in fire.

=C2=A0I used to give a whole cocon=
ut (sometimes 2 coconuts)=C2=A0in my normal homa kunda 
(16 inchx 16 inch).=
 The coconut would take at least one and half hours to burn 
properly. I wo=
uld use that time to meditate, while pouring ghee on the coconut 
at freque=
nt intervals. But the coconut will at one point spurt hot water. 
Normally =
it will spray and=C2=A0diffuse the fire,=C2=A0so keep enough ghee and camph=
or 
ready!=C2=A0

Sometimes however=C2=A0the water may=C2=A0get=C2=A0spraye=
d=C2=A0on the body of the person. That is 
why it is best if there is some =
reasonable gap between the person and the homa 
kunda, like in a fire pit. =
Prefer large coconuts than smaller ones. Large ones 
are easier to control =
in fire. Smaller coconuts are more unpredictable. 


On a different note, I=
 have had a few occassions when coconuts have burst 
uncomfortably in the k=
unda spraying water on me. Once my face got scalded such 
that I could not =
shave for a few weeks. However, the interesting thing is that 
the bursting=
 of a coconut and water getting sprayed maybe uncomfortable and 
painful, B=
UT invariable it=C2=A0sublimates some major karma that is coming. It is 
NE=
VER a radom act. I have learnt through experience. 


And coconut will prod=
uce a lot of smoke too. That is another factor to be taken 
into account. H=
owever, all said and done, it is the best offering one can make 
in fire. T=
he effects are simply=C2=A0amazing.

If you really want to take your homa e=
xperience to the next level, try full 
coconuts. And if you have a firepit =
dug, then nothing like it...

-Regards

Offering whole fresh coconut in homam

=C2=A0 
Namaste,

Depending on the m=
aterials offered in homam, the effect on one's subtle 
consciousness change=
s. One of the nice substances that one can offer in 
homam fire is a whole =
fresh coconut. Though dry coconut (copra) can also 
be offered, normal fres=
h whole coconut with water in it is a fantastic 
material. Traditionally th=
is is what was offered as poornaahuti 
(symbolic of head, i.e. ego).

BTW, =
those who do homam with a small fire using dry coconut pieces 
should ignor=
e this mail completely. Offering a whole fresh coconut in 
fire is practica=
l only for those who do homam with a big fire using logs 
of wood. You want=
 to offer something only if you can fully burn it.

If a fresh coconut is o=
ffered in fire, it will take a while to burn 
completely, because it has la=
yers (fiber, shell, white stuff and water 
etc, just like our own ego-consc=
iousness!). If one offers it in the end 
of homam, it will be a challenge t=
o make it burn fully.

One idea is to offer it in the beginning instead of =
the end, and give it 
time to burn, as one goes through homam. I, for examp=
le, offer a fresh 
coconut in my daily homam at the end of offerings to Gan=
apathi at the 
beginning of homam. Then I invoke Chandi and offer Chandipat=
h in fire 
with various offerings. During the course, the fresh coconut bur=
ns fully 
and gets reduced to ashes by the end. Having offered a whole fres=
h 
coconut in homam daily for six months, I can tell you that it is a very =

good idea (if and only if it is practical in your case).

One risk is that=
 coconut can break in a spot and hot water can gush at 
you at a speed. Tho=
ugh that can be avoided with a little understanding 
of the dynamics, one s=
hould not do this if one is worried about the 
inhury.

Best regards,
Naras=
imha
