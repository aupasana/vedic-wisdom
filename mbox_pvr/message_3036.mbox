Dear Narasimha,
=C2=A0
When Ramakrishna came out of his nirvikalpa samadhi=
, did he spend his life in Sahaja samadhi or was in some other state of con=
scinousness?
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Is Sahaja Samadhi equivalent to the idea of Kund=
alini going to Sahashra Chakra and then coming back again to Mooladhara to =
rule? This being entirely different from teh normal stay of kundalini in mo=
oladhara. Like in the spiritual=C2=A0explanation of the Ganesha story you g=
ave.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Is a Siddha, a Vigyani and a person in Sahaja samadhi eq=
uivalent?
=C2=A0
I know that all these queries are quite useless, from my p=
oint of view at least, because I am still tightly caught in the mesh of my =
own weaknesses. But since this topic was being discussed, I thought of aski=
ng.
=C2=A0
-Regards
=C2=A0Rajarshi
=C2=A0
=C2=A0

The upsurge (of conscious=
ness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra

Namaste Utpal,

Your under=
standing of nirvikalpa samadhi is not quite correct. Some people reaching n=
irvikalpa samadhi may not come back, but some people reaching nirvikalpa sa=
madhi do come back and live their lives. In other words, some people jump f=
rom the "relative" side of the wall to the "absolute" side and stay there f=
orever, while some people come back to the "relative side" to tell others a=
bout it.

Sahaja samadhi is a state where one is simultaneously on both sid=
es and does not even see them as two different sides.

One more thing.. The=
 absolute and the relative are not really two, but one. The relative is jus=
t a modification of the absolute. Shiva and Shakti are not two, but one. No=
rmally we are in the field of Shakti and not aware of the underlying Shiva =
(we see various objects, but not the underlying Reality). In nirvikalpa sam=
adhi, one is in the field of Shiva and not aware of the Shakti that manifes=
ted (i.e. one is absorbed in the underlying Reality, but not perceiving var=
ious objects). In sahaja samadhi, one is simultaneously aware of Shiva and =
Shakti and aware of them as One.

Normally, when the mind is perceiving the=
 objects of dual polarities using jnanendriyas and the mind is engaging in =
actions of dual polarities using karmendriyas, it is difficult to not accum=
ulate any conditioning such as likes, dislikes and impressions, and keep th=
e consciousness absorbed in the Absolute.

Best regards,
Narasimha

y. Savikalpa means "with vikalpa". Savikalpa samadhi is a state of intense =

 Normally, CPU is running a complex program where a lot of input channels a=
nd output channels are active. DRAM has a lot of stored data and CPU is ref=
reshing it frequently. ALU is running several algorithms based on stored da=
ta and a lot of I/O data gets stored/retrieved from DRAM all the time. This=
 is analogous to a person's normal state.

is hardly supplying any power, all input and output channels are turned off=
, I/O controller is turned off and ALU is not running any algorithms. If a =
computer goes into power standy and exits it quickly, it will resume what i=
t was doing before. Similarly, a person reaching nirvikalpa samadhi and lea=
ving it quickly will resume previous activities. If a computer stays in the=
 power standby for too long, it will be turned off and its state may be los=
t, i.e. it cannot resume. If one stays in nirvikalpa samadhi for too long, =
one will simply merge in Brahman and cannot resume previous activities.

U, ALU, memory etc are running on a central super computer and our individu=

reaching nirvikalpa samadhi and leaving it quickly will resume previous act=
ivities. If a computer stays in the power standby for too long, it will be =
turned off and its state may be lost, i.e. it cannot resume. If one stays i=
n nirvikalpa samadhi for too long, one will simply merge in Brahman and can=
not resume previous activities.<BR>> > <BR>> > Sahaja samadhi i=
s akin to a computer running a bare minimum program that accesses a program=
 running on a central super computer on a network. CPU, ALU, memory etc are=
 running on a central super computer and our individual computer's CPU simp=
ly has a small routine that accesses the results of the algorithm running o=
n the
 super computer and controls the local I/O controller accordingly. Th=
ere isn't much data stored locally and there is no algorithm running locall=
y. One's praanas are supplying power, one's jnanendriyas are getting inputs=
 and one's karmendriyas are engaging in actions, one's manas is controlling=
 this Input/Ouput activity and ahamkara (CPU) is controlling all this by ru=
nning a small program that accesses a super computer that is monitoring all=
 the computers of the world and deciding what this computer should do.<BR>&=

y very few beings can reach sahaja samadhi and it is beyond the reach of ev=
en the greatest yogis. As I said, most yogis cannot even reach nirvikalpa s=
amadhi. Some reach nirvikalpa samadhi, come back to regular consciousness a=
fter a while and start to accumulate conditioning again (chitta, i.e. DRAM)=
. The CPU is running some program or the other, however small, and
 accumul=
ating more data in DRAM and building up an algorithm in ALU. Minimization o=
f I-ness is possible, but elimination of I-ness while embodied is very diff=
icult! If any limited I-ness is left and any conditioning (I am this, I nee=
d this, I like this etc) is left, then it is NOT sahaja samadhi. Sahaja sam=
adhi is a lack of limited individual I-ness and connecting the supreme univ=
ersal I-ness directly to one's mind and body.<BR>> > <BR>> > I =
cannot make judgments on individual claims, as it is none of my business. I=
 will take on individuals only when they interfere with my dharma and my se=
nse of dharma dictates that I should take them on.<BR>> > <BR>> &g=

s of an absolutely tremendous caliber reach it. Those who reach this state =
are like the god - supreme cosmic being - himself.<BR>> > <BR>> &g=
t; * * *<BR>> > <BR>> > Let me give another
 analogy. This life=
 is like a long dream. Saviklapa samadhi is like wakig up *within* the drea=
m. Nirvikalpa samadhi is like waking up from the dream. Sahaja samadhi is l=
ike being in the dream and yet being awake.<BR>> > <BR>> > This=
 may confuse people, but this analogy shows how complex and difficult sahaj=
a samadhi is. The previous computer analogy highlights how things work in a=
 sahaja samadhi, but does not show why and how difficult it is.<BR>> >=
