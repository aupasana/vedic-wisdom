Dear Ashwin Ji,
=A0
As what Narasimha said is absolutely correct. You may t=
ry the following for one month.
=A0
1. Sit in a calm and quiet place.
2. Ch=
oose any mantra that you are comfortable with (Gayatri mantra is good, but =
is long). 
Even a small mantra like hari om tat sat or om namah shivaya wil=
l also work.
3. Now chant the mantra inside your head (brain) without produ=
cing any audible sound. Do not move your lips.
4. Focus between the centre =
of your forehead. Place between both eyebrows where third eye is supposed t=
o be.
5. Chant the mantra silently like this for one month for approximatel=
y 30 minutes daily.
=A0
You will obviously see the difference in terms of s=
atisfaction of chanting the mantra like this and the other way (CD or Caset=
te). Here you can feel the subtle vibrations that Narasimha talked about th=
at **I believe** cannot be produced by any CD or Casette, no matter who may=
 have recorded it.
=A0
Regards,
=A0
Neeraj Gupta

Nama=
ste,
=A0
Regarding 1:
=A0
In general, if anybody pastes Gayatri mantra stic=
kers on a fan and runs the fan in front of a photo or even the person direc=
tly, you can be sure that it does nothing whatsoever. This is too literal a=
 way to create "vibrations" of the mantra. Vibrations of a mantra are subtl=
e and created by the subtle body as one repeats a mantra.
=A0
However, the =
person in question may indeed have cured some people like this! As somebody=
 does spiritual sadhana, Nature may give one some abilities. Curing people =
with a specific procedure - however illogical -=A0CAN be one such ability c=
onferred by Nature after one does sadhana. The shakti generated by his prev=
ious sadhana may be slowly being put to use with each patient. Fan with Gay=
atri mantra stickers is only an instrument and the result comes because of =
the person's previous sadhana and not the procedure.
=A0
There may be peopl=
e with very minor siddhis and abilities like this, who use weird and illogi=
cal procedures to achieve tangible results. There is nothing wrong with it.=
 However, most of them fall intro the trap of thinking "I did it", "that pr=
ocedure did it" etc and feel a sense of ownership, entitlement or superiori=
ty. They may take pride in what they do. This whole thing promotes ego. In =
the process, they get stuck. They accumulate some people who admire them, b=
ut they do not=A0free themselves.=A0This may happen to people with more adv=
anced siddhis also.
=A0
However, all kinds of people are needed by Nature. =
People like this are also needed. Not everyone is going to be liberated in =
the current life. Every soul passes through various stages.
=A0
Regarding 2=
:
=A0
Vibrations are not generated by the *vaikhari* sound of a mantra repe=
ated by a machine or even a person. They are generated by the subtle body o=
f a person whose consciousness=A0is focused on a mantra. If one plays a man=
tra in a CD, listens to it actively and focuses the mind on what one is lis=
tening, then the person's thoughts while listening=A0can produce good vibra=
tions and generate purity. But, in general, playing CDs and tapes in a room=
 with nobody listening to them does not do much.
=A0
However, suppose a per=
son of sufficiently high level of purity recorded it and he intended some g=
ood results for these people. His strong intention may be sufficient to tra=
nsfer some of his energy to them and help them. Then playing of the CD can =
work as a nimitta or an=A0instrument (like the fan in case 1 above) and slo=
wly release the shakti of the person.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0

We can appreciate the work of all people. If one listen=
s to us, we can try to impress upon one some spiritual teachings of rishis =
and great saints and try to help one see things in proper light and not get=
 stuck.=A0If other people foolishly try to imitate someone's illogical proc=
edure, because it seems to work,=A0we can try to educate them and remove th=
eir misconceptions.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0=

We can advise others and try to help others, but we cannot really change a=
nybody. But each of us can definitely change ONE person and correct the att=
itude of that person. And, that person is oneself.
=A0
Best regards,
Narasi=

Dear Sir, 
1. I had visited on=
e Gentleman in 1980 who was curing the patients by simply their photographs=
. He was demamding photo of the patient. He had pasted Gayatri Mantra stick=
er on all the three wings of a table fan and he was keeping the photograph =
of the patient just opposit the fan. He was switching his fan on for 1 or 2=
 hours daily for couple of days and as per his say, he was throwing the vib=
rations of Gayatri Mantra directly to the photograph. He was claiming that =
he has cured so many patients by Gayatri Mantra vibrations.=A0
2. Some peop=
le are arranging some Mantra cassette or CD in their worship room and playi=
ng them for couple of hours daily and believing that the room is charged du=
e to Mantra vibrations. Some are playing these type of =A0CDs in their Car =
to get protection from accidents and like. All are doing these as per their=
 believes.
=A0=A0 What I want to know from you Sir is whether this is reall=
y working? Can anybody be cured by=A0 Gayatri Mantra-written Fan?
=A0 Can a=
 CD or Cassette create vibrations? If someone is sleeping in the room where=
 whole night one CD of a cerain Mantra is played. The person is unaware of =
it. Whether Mantra will crerate any positive effect on him?
