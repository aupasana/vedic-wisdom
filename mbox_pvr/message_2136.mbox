Namaste,
 
I am forwarding this to the list without revealing your name, so=
 that others can also benefit from it. Thanks for the nice quote from Ramak=
rishna.
 
Though individual will (or free will) is non-existent from the pe=
rspective of a realized soul, it does exist for one who has an individual s=
elf-awareness (I-ness) that is limited to a body. One can do whatever one w=
ants - good and bad - and declare at the end like a great philosopher, "god=
 did it through me". But, the fact is that god did it through him, through =
his individual I-ness. The fruits of the action will be reaped by his indiv=
idual I-ness in future. If the fruits are very unpleasant, one may feel gre=
at pain. One will not then think "god is doing things through me and god is=
 experiencing this pain through me". Instead, one will cry out loud, "I am =
in pain"! Until one severs individual I-ness completely, there is no point =
in rhetorical declarations of god doing everything.
 
I have seen some Indi=
an movies in which the villain quotes Bhagavad Gita and declares "I am not =
the doer. Krishna is the doer. He is doing this through me" and then goes o=
n to do evil acts. That is not the correct attitude. If everyone entertains=
 that attitude and does whatever one wants, there will be more sin in the w=
orld as Ramakrishna correctly said below.
 
As long as one has invidiaul I-=
ness, one will continue to be held responsible for actions committed by tha=
t I-ness and reap the good and bad fruits (and be born many times if needed=
). Only when that individual I-ness completely melts can one actually exper=
ience what Ramakrishna said below and remain pure, untouched by the actions=
 committed.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

When I first =
read what you wrote below, understood the theory but still didn't "get it",=
 like you had warned. Then I read this:
-----------------------------------=
---------------
"Vaidyanath - Sir, I have a doubt about what they call free=
 will. Sometimes I wonder if it is true that I can do a good act as well as=
 a bad one. Do we really have free will?
 
Sri Ramakrishna - Everything is =
under the Lord's control - it is all His lila (divine sport). He has create=
d a variety of things: small, big, powerful, weak, good and bad. Whether a =
man is good or bad is all His maya, His sport. Don't you see that all the t=
rees in the garden are not alike?
 
"Till one has realized God, one enterta=
ins the feeling that one is free to act. This illusion is also created by H=
im. If man did not feel that he had free will, there would be much more sin=
. If sin entailed no punishment, one would have no fear of it.
 
"Do you kn=
ow how one feels when one has realized the Lord? It is like this: I am a ma=
chine, You are the operator; I am the home, You are the mistress of the hom=
e. I am a chariot and You are the charioteer. I move the way You make me mo=
ve. I speak the way You make me speak."

and then came back and read your post carefully again. Suddenly thing=

rom the perspective of supreme cosmic

gt; Now, let us come lower and into the field of 
duality. The field of dua=

space-time continua=
. There are infinite possibilities within this field.<BR>> 
<BR>> Nor=
mally, people stuck deeply within duality have a linear sense of 
time and =
perceive just a part of one space-time continuum. However, field of 
dualit=
y also contains planes of consciousness where different senses of time and =

different space-time continua (that may intersect at various points) exist=
. A 
yogi who experiences such a space-time continuum in such a plane of 
c=
onsciousness may experience a point of time that maps to a future time in a=
 
regular space-time continuum being experienced by you. Also, what is 1 mi=
nute in 
one space-time continuum may be 1 year in another space-time conti=
nuum. Time is 
not as straight-forward an entity as one may think. Basicall=
y, the field of 
duality contains infinite space-time continua and what one=
 experiences depends 
on the plane of consciousness that one's self-awarene=
ss (Kundalini) is in. But, 
most of us experience part of a specific space-=
time continuum and hence think 
that that is the only reality. But relaity =
consists of infinite space-time 
continua that intersect each other. These =
are all different possibilities and 
you chart out your course based on you=
r actions and Nature's reactions to your 
actions.<BR>> <BR>> * =
       
*      =
  *<BR>> <BR>> From the 
perspective of a yogi who is in a diffe=
rent space-time continuum, your state may 
be known at a time that is in "f=
uture" as per the space-time continuum in which 
you exist. But, from the p=
erspective of the space-time continuum that you are 
in, your state at that=
 future time is not yet known and depends on your current 
action.<BR>> =
<BR>> If a yogi in a different space-time continuum has seen 
your state=
 in future, his observation is merely an observation and from his 
referenc=
e frame. It has no causal relationship to your current action or your 
futu=
re state. He is merely an observer and he does not cause anything to happen=
. 
His observation is specific to some space-time pairs and does not cover =
all the 
space-time pairs that you will traverse as you travel to reach the=
 space-time 
pair where he observed you (if at all you do!).<BR>> <BR>&g=
t; 
*        
*    &=
nbsp;   *<BR>> <BR>> Let us go 
further. Is there only one =
future possible for you? Or, does the path traversed 
by you in space-time =
continuum not fixed but variable based on your actions? Can 
your actions a=
t important cross-roads alter the course you traverse?<BR>> 
<BR>> If=
 so, what is the meaning of a yogi observing you at a space-time 
pair? Is =
his observation only a possibility or a certainty? One may say "how can 
on=
e observe a possibility? Anything we observe must be a certainty." But is t=
hat 
correct? Aren't the field of duality and the infinite space-time conti=
nua 
contained in it merely a set of infinite possibilities?<BR>> <BR>&g=
t; Some 
great rishis can see not just a space-time pair, but many space-ti=
me continua at 
the same time, i.e. they can see various possibilities base=
d on various possible 
actions. However, visions seen by most yogis about "=
future" are just one 
possibility.<BR>> <BR>> *   &nbs=
p;    
*        *<BR>>=
 <BR>> Bottomline: At 
the level at which we exist, there is certainly s=
omething called "freewill". 
Within the limits imposed by the reactions giv=
en by nature to your own previous 
actions, you do have a scope for engagin=
g in different actions at this time. 
Depending on which action you engage =
in, the future can be slightly different. 
Some actions can even make the f=
uture significantly different. A rishi may be 
able to chart out a signific=
ant portion of the field of possibilities for future 
(e.g. like a brillian=
t chess player figuring out most possibilities upto 20 
moves from now). An=
 advanced yogi may be able to see a few possibilities for 
future (e.g. lik=
e a good chess player figuring out a few moves or guessing a 
future positi=
on). But the supreme cosmic being knows the entire field of 
possibilities,=
 as they all exist within Him.<BR>> <BR>> However, your 
actions are =
what bring to fruition (w.r.t. the reference frame of your 
consciousness!)=
 some of those possibilities. One may know all the possibilities 
quite dee=
ply and even guess the possibility that will come to fruition, but it 
is y=
our actions that actually make some of those possibilities a 
reality.<BR>&=

bsp;      This boy 
was born and brought up in US =
and is not proficient in his knowledge of 
Hinduism. He did not know much a=
bout some of the ten incarnations. He described 
what he saw and I told him=
 who was who and a little about them. One of the forms 
he saw was a radian=

road. I told him =
he was Kalki and he hadn't come yet.<BR>>

This boy is usually playf=

one morning, I saw hi=
m lost in some serious thought. This was abou a week after 
the episode men=
tioned in the above mail.<BR>> 
<BR>>     &n=
bsp;     I asked 
what he was thinking. He said, "it is=
 not that the future that is to come has 
not already happened. It has alre=
ady happened in reality, but it will happen 
later when the time comes. You=
 know what I mean?" I guessed what he was getting 
at, but pretended not to=
 know. I said, "no. What do you mean?"<BR>> 
<BR>>   &=
nbsp;       He said, "I 
don't know how to sa=

intelligent or a=

cheerful, playful=
, sweet, kind, contented and relaxed. However, he was onto 
something today=
. But he could not express himself.<BR>> 
<BR>>   &nbs=
p;       I helped 
him, "do you mean to say t=
hat future has already happened at some level, but 
will reveal itself to p=

did not mention it, I knew why h=

yet to come, he was prob=
ably confused. Given his age and ability to think and 
understand things, t=
his probably seemed like an oddity to him that he should see 
somebody who =
had not yet come. So he was trying to think how it was possible and 
came t=
o some important conclusions about "time" in his own way.<BR>> 
<BR>>=
           Time seems 
li=

The same boy once performed a very short Kaali homam with a small naama =
mantra 
of Dakshina Kaali with beejaakshara added before name. When we were=
 meditating 
after poornaahuti, I felt a very intense and powerful energy. =
It was quite 
different from the energy I feel normally. This intense energ=
y made my mind feel 
satisfied and blissful and a feeling that can be loose=
ly expressed in words as 
"I am done here. I have nothing more left to do. =
Time to leave" filled my entire 
consciousnss.<BR>> 
<BR>>  =
;         I had 
experienced the sa=
me kind of intense energy twice before that. Once I 
experienced the same e=
nergy when I was meditating sitting next to my guru Manish 
who was doing a=
 Chandi homam in India. Second time was when I had an unexpected 
opportuni=
ty to meditate inside the garbhaalaya of a famous temple, standing 
within =
3 feet from the main Kaali idol there, which was sanctified and 
worshipped=
 by a great saint in the past. The energy I felt was the same on all 
the t=
hree occasions. At no other time did I feel that intense shakti.<BR>>

Intere=
stingly, after we finished meditation and opened eyes, that boy remarked, 
=
"out of all the different homas I did so far, this is the bestest homam." I=

p;   Keep 
performing your chosen spiritual practices, but do pay=

spiritual progress and purity is how smaller your =

 things better and you can resist 
internal enemies like lust, anger, jealo=

O=
vercoming ego using jnaana yoga is relatively challenging, but bhakti yoga =
is 
easier. Think that all that is around you - including your house, money=

spouse, children and your own body - is god's property and that yo=
u are a 
temporary caretaker of all of these properties of god. Do the best=
 job you can,

p;          Realize 
that thin=

A =
servant who loves one's master takes the best care of things entrusted to o=

When a thing is taken away, a servant does not waste time worrying and=
 crying. A 
servant will accept that is master's property and can be taken =
away anytime.
