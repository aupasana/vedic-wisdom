Namaste,

I am cc'ing the reply to vedic-wisdom yahoogroup, without reveali=
ng your 
identity.

I (@homam108) tweeted on twitter a few days back:

>> J=
agat isnt mithya. Brahman is satya & jagat 2 is satya.
>> Neither mirror no=
r ur image in it r "illusions". They r "real". But 
>> ur thinking 1/2
>> t=
hat ur image in mirror is ur extension is an illusion.
>> Excitement/sadnes=
s abt things happenin 2 d mirror image is an 
>> illusion.2/2

The followin=
g question was asked by private email:

> Can you please clarify the concep=
t of satya & non-mithya in light of
> Vasishtha's words in Yoga Vasishtha (=
2.3.11 - 2.3.18)?

*        *        *

Obviously my tweets were from a lim=
ited context. To say that jagat is 
satya is, strictly speaking, against sc=
ripture. When my mind making 
these statements and your mind trying to abso=
rb them are part of this 
jagat, what is the point in declaring that jagat =
is mithya, even if that 
were true? It sends the message "all this is an il=
lusion and so whatever 
I do does not matter". Instead, my message is "this=
 is not an illusion 
and real. But you are corrupting the reality with illu=
sions. Weed out 
the illusions." Once someone actually starts to weed out a=
ll obvious 
illusions, eventually one realizes that everything other than 
=
unconditioned Self is an illusion anyway.

*        *        *

So I took t=
he approach of accepting that the world is a reality and then 
rejecting th=
ings that can be deduced to be illusions.

For example, let me assume that =
"I, Narasimha Rao, an individual being 
in this world" is not an illusion a=
nd a valid and true entity. I can 
first accept it to be real and then star=
t analyzing various extensions 
of that entity. For example, people's views=
 on this entity are formed 
based on an impression/reflection of this entit=
y in their minds, which 
is influenced by this entity to some extent, but n=
ot fully. Just as my 
reflection in different mirrors may look different ba=
sed on the colors, 
dust, refractive properties etc of the mirrors etc, my =
reflection in 
different minds may be different. Just as I cannot think tha=
t my 
reflections in all mirrors around me are extensions of myself and sta=
rt 
celebrating or ruing anything happeneing to those reflections, so shoul=
d 
I not think that my reflections in the minds of people around me are 
ex=
tensions of myself and start celebrating or ruing anything happening 
to th=
ose reflections!

Thus, I can reject a lot of notions that I may tend to ha=
ng on to, as an 
illusion. This is what I am saying above. I may not be an =
illusion, a 
mirror (mind of someone) may not be an illusion, my image in t=
he mirror 
(that person's notion of who I am) may not be an illusion, BUT m=
y 
thinking that my image in the mirror is an extension of my personality 
=
is an illusion.

Similarly, we build complicated structures in our own mind=
s regarding 
various external objects our senses perceive. When senses perc=
eive those 
objects, mind thinks of a notional being that is far more compl=
icated 
than the objective reality represented by it! It is influenced by m=
any 
notions arising in our conditioning and not just based on the concrete=
 
objective reality. Again, such notions can be identified and rejected as =

illusions.

As you identify and reject each layer of obvious illusion abou=
t your 
sense of who you are, who/what you are dealing with, you eventually=
 
realize unconditioned Self. Until then, "jaganmithya" is a meaningless 
a=
nd also perhaps a dangerous notion.

Best regards,
Narasimha
