Namaste,

Eating spicy food increases the jatharagni. That is why most sadhus stick to 
saattwik food without heavy spices.

Some habits become an obstacle in spiritual sadhana and slow down things. 
But it is possible to make progress despite unconducive habits.

Best regards,
Narasimha

Namaste

""Eating spicy food with a lot of chillies, cinnamon, cloves, pepper
etc increases the fire.""

which fire Bhutagni or Jatahar agni

becoz vimalananda has written somewhere in books
that at certain age he ate lot of green chillies.

and sticking to steamed rice, bread, simple proteins like moong dal
and thoroughly cooked simple vegetables such as squash, carrots etc
and using simple spices such as coriander powder and cumene poweder
will help in easy digestion and keeping jatharaagni low but
sufficient for healthy living.

physical food).

to have a gap of atleast 2 hours from the time you eat and you do
homam/meditation. If you are doing it in the morning, do not eat
anything before. That should help.
