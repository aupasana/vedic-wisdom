Namaste,

Manish was reading half of the Veda mantra given in the homam man=
uals (RigVeda 10.16.9 - kravyaadamagnim) when he rejected a lit matchstick =
in the southwestern corner.

The Veda mantra literally means, "I keep the f=
orm of fire known as kravyaada (consumer of flesh) at bay. May the carrier =
of the inauspicious go to Lord Yama. May the other form of fire known as Ja=
atavedas (all-knowing and all-possessing one) come here and carry oblations=
 to deities."

Rejecting a lit matchstick behind one is a risky instruction=
 to give, i.e. something can catch fire if one is not careful. So it was no=
t a part of the standardized procedure in the manual. Moreover, many priest=
s do not do it. Some priests touch the homa kundam with darbha and leave it=
 in the southwestern corner.

Those who want to use a lit matchstick or a d=
arbha and leave it on the southwest can feel free to do so. Those who do no=
t do either need not worry and continue their procedure.

Also, there are s=
light differences in the way Manish pronounces "kravyaadamagnim" and how it=
 is given in the manual. Manish told me it was a RigVeda mantra. He asked t=
o search for it in RigVeda and give the correct text in the manual, which I=
 did.

Best regards,
Narasimha

Symbolically it makes sense as kravyaada agni is inauspicio=
us, and the mantra is requesting that he go. 



Should this be done when r=
eciting the mantra for homam?
