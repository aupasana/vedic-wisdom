Namaste,
=A0
As this may be of interest to others too, I will reply on the =
list without revealing your identity.
=A0
You seem to be referring to the i=
ncident in the following message after guessing and filling in some blanks:=

=A0

If someone is in non-dual Nirvika=
lpa samadhi, one does not perceive a manifestation of a goddess or what som=
eone else is doing thousands of kilometres away. One will perceive such thi=
ngs only when in dualistic samadhis.
=A0
Some people who can reach Nirvikal=
pa samadhi may sometimes be in Nirvikalpa samadhi and sometimes in other du=
alistic samadhis. For example, Totapuri was familiar only with non-dual Nir=
vikalpa samadhi, but Ramakrishna Paramahamsa used to go to non-dual Nirvika=
lpa samadhi as well as other dualistic samadhis frequently.

One more thing..
=A0
One who reac=
hes Nirvikalpa samadhi may experience a lot of things in the transition to/=
from it. When one's mind goes from one space-time point to the root of all =
space-times where there is no concept of space and time or when one's mind =
is coming back from it to one space-time point, one's mind may become "awar=
e of" several space-time points during the transition. Thus, a yogi who goe=
s to Nirvikalpa samadhi and comes back (instead of merging in Brahman forev=
er) may "know" some things that he would otherwise not know.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Most yogis cannot control what pa=
rts of the duality they perceive. But rishis used to be able to go to any s=
pace-time point at will and perceive *anything* within duality. Nothing wit=
hin duality is hidden from them.
=A0
This is the difference between differe=
nt beings. Many yogis may be able to overcome mental conditioning through s=
adhana and absorb mind in non-dual Self and become liberated. Very few can =
come back to duality after that and continue to live in duality unaffected =
by it. Of those, different people have different levels of mastery over dua=
lity. Mastering non-duality is one thing and mastering duality is another.
