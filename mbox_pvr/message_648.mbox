Namaste,
 
> Is it seriously possible? Or only a theoritical concept? 
 
Ab=
solutely.
 
Once Ramakrishna Paramahamsa wanted to give some siddhis (mysti=
cal abilities) to Vivekananda. Vivekananda asked "will they help me realize=
 Self". Ramakrishna said "no". Vivekananda said "then I do not want them. L=
et me first realize Self. Then we will see."
 
Things obtained before one i=
s ready are detrimental to progress. Things like mystical experiences, myst=
ical abilities etc are actually like a detour on the path of self-realizati=
on. When they happen to one still with an ego, they may fan the flame of eg=
o rather than extinguish it. When a realized soul gets them, they do no har=
m. But when an unprepared person gets them, they can spoil one.
 
Accepting=
 what nature gives us without our asking for is fine, but craving for thing=
s is not good, mystical experiences included.
 
Self-realization comes when=
 ego is completely effaced. Mystical experiences are neither necessary nor =
sufficient for that. As I said before:
 
"If you normally feel sad or angry=
 or upset when someone criticizes you badly and you are now able to feel no=
rmal in that situation, isn't that a "tangible" sign of progress? If you no=
rmally feel elated when someone praises you to the sky and you are now able=
 to feel normal in that situation, isn't that a "tangible" sign of progress=
?
 
Instead of focusing your senses outward and looking for some miracle or=
 an "extraordinaty experience", focus your senses inward, watch your though=
ts and instincts closely and refine them. Try to reach a state where critic=
ism and praise are the same for you."
 
Control over the mind and senses an=
d control over the six internal enemies (lust, anger, greed, delusion, want=
onness and jealosy) are a far more accurate metric to judge the spiritual p=
rogress. If one watches one's own thoughts and instincts honestly, one shou=
ld be able to know what is happening inside the mind.
 
I know someone who =
did not even have an awakened Kundalini and had no mystical experiences of =
any kind but had Kundalini reach sahasrara directly oneday, went into nirvi=
kalpa samadhi, stayed in it for 7 days and returned after 7 days as a brahm=
a jnaani to lead a different life. Of course, it was possible due to the pu=
rity generated for several years before that.
 
Instead of focusing on the =
*symptoms* and recreating the symptoms observed by some people when they ma=
de spiritual progress, it will be productive if one focuses on the root. Mi=
nd and its ego are the root of all bondage we experience. Reduction of the =
ego is the solution that frees one. Other things like mystical experiences,=
 mystical abilities, visions, Kundalini rise etc are symptoms and not the r=
oot. If one is successful in recreating the symptoms without making much pr=
ogress on the root, it is futile really.
 
Whatever path one follows, one w=
ill do well to cut down on all cravings - including those for mystical expe=
riences - and be vigiliant in observing one's thoughts and instincts. There=
 is no substitute to cutting the ego, if one is genuinely interested in sel=
f-realization.

Narasimha

          Dear Utpal,

          One person may be seeing visions of deities, experiencing mys=
tical things 
          and another person may not be experiencing any such=
 "extraordinary" things. 
          Yet, the latter may realize Self first.=
 It IS possible.

          Believe me, all it takes for Her is a split sec=
ond to turn a fool into a 
          self-realized person.

          You w=
ill do yourself a big favor if you take the thoughts of "extraordinary 
   =
       experiences" off your mind. These expectations are a big obstacle.

=
          If you normally feel sad or angry or upset when someone criticize=
s you badly 
          and you are now able to feel normal in that situatio=
n, isn't that a 
          "tangible" sign of progress? If you normally fee=
l elated when someone 
          praises you to the sky and you are now abl=
e to feel normal in that 
          situation, isn't that a "tangible" sign=
 of progress?

          Instead of focusing your senses outward and lookin=
g for some miracle or an 
          "extraordinaty experience", focus your =
senses inward, watch your thoughts 
          and instincts closely and ref=
ine them. Try to reach a state where criticism 
          and praise are th=
e same for you.

          That will put you in a good stead. THAT is real =
progress. If you make real 
          progress and do not bother about any =
"extraordinary experiences" , you may 
          indeed have an extraordina=
ry experience oneday! Not the one that gets you 
          stuck with a sen=
se of possessiveness or entitlement, but the one that frees 
          you.=

          One can get =
stuck in some expectations that are unknowingly formed in the 
          mi=
nd based on what one read or heard.

          One can get stuck in possess=
iveness or a sense of entitlement over an 
          "extraordinary experie=
nce" that actually happened to him.

          One can get stuck in many wa=
ys.

          If you do not want to get stuck, have no expectations. Have =
no sense of 
          ownership over anything. Surrender to Her fully, not=
 because it will give X 
          or Y or Z, but because everything is rea=
lly Hers. Keep looking at yourself 
          and your own actions/thoughts=
 and refine them to make the sense of surrender 
          fuller and fulle=
r. And expect to get nothing from Her in return for that 
          surrend=
er. That is a surefire way to succeed in one's spiritual pursuit.
