Namaste friends,
 
There is one more thing I wanted to include in the analo=
gy/parable, but did not do so due to lack of time last night. Let me expand=
 now. Though this is not related to the original questions, this will compl=
ete the story.
 
*        *        *
 
There was a way to the sea through a=
 country called "Vishnu raajyam" [Vaishnavism]. Some people travelled the p=
ath, found a beautiful city called Vishnupuri on the coast and the sea was =
close to the city. The journey through Vishnu raajya was documented in a bo=
ok [Vishnu Purana] and the book claimed that this was a beautiful journey a=
nd enables one to reach the sea. It also claimed that other coastal cities =
were by the very same sea and reaching the sea here amounts to reaching the=
 sea at all other places.
 
There was another way to the sea through a coun=
try called "Shiva desam" [Shaivism]. Some people travelled the path, found =
a wonderful city called Shivanagari on the coast and the sea was right next=
 to it. The journey though Shiva desam was documented in a book [Shiva Pura=
na] and the book claimed that this was an amazing journey and enables one t=
o reach the sea. It also claimed that other coastal cities were by the very=
 same sea and reaching the sea here amounts to reaching the sea at all othe=
r places.
 
There were some people who had never actually been to either ci=
ty nor seen the sea. Some were impressed by the description of one city and=
 some by the other. They were so impressed that they started arguing which =
was the best city. Some even went to the extent of condemning and putting d=
own the other city. Some people who had seen both the cities came forward a=
nd said, "the main thing is not the city, but the sea itself. The sea is th=
e same in both places. Though different, both cities are nice and both give=
 one the same sea." That did not convince the fighting factions and they co=
ntinued to fight. Later, some of them even forgot about the sea and started=
 thinking that the city was the main thing and not the sea. Of course, both=
 the cities are really beautiful. Stuck in their animosity and fights, they=
 could never visit either city nor enjoy the sea.
 
*        *        *
 
O=
K, I think the parable is complete now. :-)
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

a etc


  Namaste Sir,

  There is no need for either Sri or Ji in addressi=
ng me.

  Hoping you won't mind, I am sending this reply to some yahoogroup=
s that may have some interested people. When I was meditating before replyi=
ng to you, a really beautiful and meaningful analogy came to me and I think=
 it is worth sharing with more people than just you. To ensure your anonymi=
ty, I removed references in the quoted mail below that may help one identif=
y you.

  *        *        *

  First I will answer your first question in=
 detail, because that can automatically answer other questions.

  > 1. Are=
 Vedic (Pure Vaithika rituals) different from Mantra Shastras
  > (people e=
xplain that mantra shastra does not originate from the vedas,
  > but class=
ified under tantra). Did Mantra shastras not originate from vedas?

  *    =
    *        *

  When people say what is in Veda and what is not, honestly=
 I can only laugh. They are only fooling themselves. Reciting Veda with per=
fect swara or mastering a celebrated commentary does not help one understan=
d Veda. In fact, understanding each single verse in Veda requires great tap=
ascharya. Understanding a verse in Veda is neither possible with energy flo=
wing in Ida nadi (intuition) nor in Pingala nadi (logic and analysis). It i=
s possible only with energy flowing in Sushumna nadi. It is possible with n=
either intuition nor logic, but only with *revelation* and simply, for the =
lack of a better expression, direct knowledge.

  When one meditates long e=
nough on a verse, the verse may simply be revealed to the yogi. THAT is the=
 only way to understand a Vedic verse. For most people, it is not possible =
to decipher even a single verse in an entire life, let alone a passage.

  =
Bottomoline is: Almost nobody understands Veda today. What are considered "=
pure vaidika rituals" are merely another variety of rituals created by some=
one at some point of time. From the point of view of authenticity as grante=
d by Veda, there is no difference between them and other aagamic rituals, t=
hough people ignorantly believe otherwise.

  *        *        *

  A simp=
le analogy may help clarify a lot of things related to this complicated iss=
ue a little. What the thing in the analogy represents is shown here and the=
re in square brackets [].

  Once there were many people who lived near the=
 sea [Brahman/Aatman]. They regularly sat by the sea and enjoyed the sight =
and sound of the sea [experienced Brahman]. They described the sea in some =
nice cryptic poems [Veda].

  As people started living a little away from t=
he sea [less spiritually evolved], someone had to put together some instruc=
tions on how to reach the sea. He said, "keep walking towards east" and the=
 instructions grew with time. People faithfully followed the instructions [=
rituals].

  People started moving further and further inland and started l=
iving in a landlocked desert far away from the sea. This generation had nev=
er seen a pool of water like a lake, let alone a sea. They faithfully perfo=
rmed the ritual of walking towards east, but did not find sea. They debated=
 endlessly whether one had to walk one mile or two miles or three miles and=
 formed different schools of thought. Some walked their chosen distance, fo=
und a tree or a building or some interesting object and even became satisfi=
ed that that was sea!

  Then came some great person, whose instincts led h=
im to take a horse instead of walking and ride it for a long distance [use =
of other tools]. He did find the sea after a few months. He put together ne=
wer instructions to reach the sea, which included riding a horse [new aagam=
as].

  People performing the old rituals objected to this and said "but th=
en this horse thing is not granted by the book of sea. This is a new path a=
nd different from the "pure" sea ritual" ["pure" Vedic ritual]. By now, peo=
ple did not even understand what the cryptic poems of the original "book of=
 sea" mean, but they simply believed that those poems taught the old "pure"=
 sea rituals that they were used to. They were blissfully unaware that the =
original instructions were meant for someone already close to sea and the n=
ewer instructions came from someone who actually saw the sea and knew where=
 they currently lived and how to get to the sea from there!

  Slowly many =
new sets of instructions involving horses, chariots etc were taught and man=
y new paths to the sea were outlined instead of just instructing people to =
walk towards east [evolution of mantra/tantra/yantras].

  One particular p=
ath through jungles was dangerous [aghora and other dark tantric paths invo=
lving practice of sex, meat, wine etc]. Though the distance to sea was much=
 shorter through that jungle, it was just too dangerous and only the braves=
t and strongest could make it. There were cruel dacoits and wild animals [c=
hance of a fall in a risky ritual] and many weak people travelling to sea v=
ia that path were killed. A wise man who knew the entire territory well cam=
e forward, condemned that path and discouraged people from trying that path=
. Since then, even people who were strong enough to successfully make it in=
 that path desisted from it.

  As time progressed, people started fighting=
 too much about whose path was superior. They were foolish, not smart enoug=
h to adopt the original instructions, of either the so-called "pure" sea pa=
th or the so-called "new" path or other variations, for the changed geograp=
hy and changed times. Many followed the instructions blindly, hit roadblock=
s and did not reach sea. Many did not even know that "reaching the sea" was=
 the actual goal of all their joirneys. They only thought they were suppose=
d to follow the instructions faithfully and there was no need to adopt to t=
he changed geographical territory and time. They even condemned those who a=
ctually went to sea, came back and gave updated directions for their place =
and time, for violating tradition.

  *        *        *

  In case the an=
alogy is not clear, here is a brief summary of its points. Veda is about re=
alizing self. Veda describes various aspects of the state of self-realizati=
on. That is why it is considered the highest knowledge. Other allied subjec=
ts throw some light on possible ways to reach that state. While definitive =
statements can be made on the actual state of self-realization itself, no d=
efinitive statements can be made on how to reach it. The path depends on on=
e's current position!

  Great men in many spiritual paths, within Hinduism=
 as well as outside of it, came, experienced that state, understood the cur=
rent state of people around them and gave specific instructions on how to r=
each that state from the current state. Some followed the instructions and =
experienced the state. Some instead kept arguing about the contradictions b=
etween paths.

  Please re-read the story and try to understand what each p=
art of the story represents. If you understand this analogy well, this can =
really clarify the meaningless nature of so many debates that people waste =
time with!

  *        *        *

  > 2. I read from somewhere that Sri Sr=
i Adi Sankara has condemned
  > Tantrik practices. But I also hear and read=
 that he is a great Sri Vidya
  > Upasaka himself. If Sri Vidya has its roo=
ts from Tantra, what did
  > Sri Adi Sankara condemn? 

  He did condemn so=
me vaamaachaara (left-hand) practices of tantra like the use of sex, alcoho=
l, meat etc.

  However, please go back to my analogy. A great man may cond=
emn the use of a short path to reach the sea if it has a lot of wild animal=
s and dacoits and many travellers through that path recently lost their liv=
es. It does not mean that path is totally unusable. It only means that too =
many people incapable of travelling on that path are using it of late and s=
o the great man was compelled to stop the practice.

  If the same great ma=
n is reincarnated at a different time when several adept souls he has a rin=
a with are about to be reincarnated, he may not condemn the path and instea=
d write on travelling that jungle path carefully!

  The words of great mas=
ters need to be interpreted within the context of their desa, kaala and paa=
tra and within the context of the purpose of that particular birth.

  *   =
     *        *

  > 3. What is vamachara? if it is the left hand method - =
sex, drinks etc,
  > why must it be practiced at all?

  Suppose one's hous=
e is close to the market and the market noise reaches one's house. Suppose =
that noise is disturbing one's meditation, i.e. one is unable to focus on g=
od amid all the noise. There are two approaches one can take - (1) run away=
 from the noise, find a place of solitude and meditate there. (2) rise to t=
he challenge, meditate right there and develop the ability to turn off the =
sensory input to the mind, i.e. get mastery and control over the part of th=
e mind that is making one vulnerable to this disturbance. After all, the no=
ise from outside is NOT the problem - the problem is the *inability* of one=
's mind to turn off that sensory input. By controlling one's mind, one can =
focus attention on god irrespective of what is happening outside.

  Approa=
ch (1) is not bad. If one is weak-minded and has a decent chance of failure=
 with approach (2), then approach (1) is definitely prudent and worthwhile.=
 But, if one has a strong mind and can succeed with approach (2), it is gre=
at. It hastens one's progress.

  *        *        *

  Vaamaachaara is al=
so like that, but a more extreme form of testing one's self-control by risi=
ng to the challenge.

  Please realize that vaamaachaara/aghora is not abou=
t the use of sex, wine etc for the kick of it. It is about their use to tes=
t oneself with the toughest challenges and hone one's self-control. Self-re=
alization comes when self-control is perfect and one's mind can always be f=
ocussed on god no matter what is going on around one. If one is either attr=
acted or averse to any one thing, that is enough to block self-realization.=


  However, if one is weak, it is better to stay away from vaamaachaara. O=
ne needs to do other practices and strengthen oneself. If a really pure yog=
i with perfect self-control is able to focus on god with all his mind even =
when he is drunk and sitting naked with a beautiful naked woman tightly emb=
racing him, then he can try that to test his self-control and hone it. But,=
 if that is going to tempt one, get the mind away from god and onto a physi=
cal enjoyment, then one better not try that path! Just as one who does not =
have a strong mind to meditate amid noise should meditate in solitude and h=
one one's self-control, one who does not have a strong mind to keep the foc=
us on god in the middle of normally depriving practices such as wine, meat =
and sex should stay away from those.

  *        *        *

  In my analog=
y before, the short jungle path to the sea having the danger of wild animal=
s and dacoits represents the vaamaachaara path of aghora. If one not having=
 the wherewithal to battle and kill the wild animals and dacoits tries that=
 path, one may be killed. Similarly, one who wants self-realization using t=
his path will fall if one does not have perfect self-control. If one takes =
this path because it sounds cool or exciting, one is likely to fall. It is =
only for the fittest and bravest.

  If there is ANY weakness in one's self=
-control, one can NOT follow this path. Just as there are many paths from t=
he desert to the sea in my analogy, there are many paths to self-realizatio=
n. One should follow the path that is appropriate for one based on previous=
 samskaras, strengths and weaknesses.

  *        *        *

  > Is it not=
 a fact that Sri Ambal lies above all these? 

  :-) Sri Ambal (the Divine =
Mother) does not lie above or below anything. She lies everywhere! All know=
ledge, all desires and all actions of all beings are Her own different mani=
festations.

  If a yogi with perfect self-control drinks wine and sits nak=
ed with a beautiful naked woman tightly embracing him and yet keeps his min=
d fully focussed on god, his self-control, his focus on god are all differe=
nt manifestations of the Divine Mother only.

  As a matter of fact, even i=
f one gives in to base instincts and pursues carnal pleasures, his desires =
and actions are also different manifestations of Divine Mother only. The Mo=
ther gives rise to so many lower level forms with specific domains of respo=
nsibility. The Mother takes the form of Lakshmi and Alakshmi as well. She t=
akes the form of Vidya and Avidya as well. All opposites and polarities are=
 actually Her manifestations only.

  However, those who are more comfortab=
le with Lakshmi and Vidya and uncomfortable with Alakshmi and Avidya will l=
ook at only the former pair as manifestation of Divine Mother and remain in=
 duality. That is a valid point of view. However, the *ultimate* reality is=
 that She is All.

  I need to sleep now. I will stop here. Hope that put a=
 few things in perspective. You can send further questions to the yahoogrou=
ps or to me privately.

  Best regards,
  Narasimha

    Namaskarams. Hope you remember me. I am a friend of <deleted> of=
 <deleted> temple, brother of <deleted>. We met a couple of years ago in <d=
eleted> temple.

    I have a few doubts. I would like to hear your opinion=
 on the same.

    1. Are Vedic (Pure Vaithika rituals) different from Mant=
ra Shastras (people explain that mantra shastra does not originate from the=
 vedas, but classified under tantra). Did Mantra shastras not originate fro=
m vedas?

    2. I read from somewhere that Sri Sri Adi Sankara has condemn=
ed Tantrik practices. But I also hear and read that he is a great Sri Vidya=
 Upasaka himself. If Sri Vidya has its roots from Tantra, what did Sri Adi =
Sankara condemn? 

    3. What is vamachara? if it is the left hand method =
- sex, drinks etc, why must it be practiced at all? Is it not a fact that S=
ri Ambal lies above all these? 

    I am a little (totally) confused. Hope=
 your reply takes me out of the well to ask you more questions

   <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>1. Are Vedic (Pure Vaithika rituals) di=
fferent 
    from Mantra Shastras (people explain that mantra shastra does =
not originate 
    from the vedas, but classified under tantra). Did Mantra=
 shastras not 
    originate from vedas?</FONT></DIV>

2. I read from somewhere that Sri Sri Adi 
    Sankara has condemned Tantri=
k practices. But I also hear and read that he is 
    a great Sri Vidya Upa=
saka himself. If Sri Vidya has its roots from Tantra, 
    what did Sri Adi=
 Sankara condemn? </FONT></DIV>

 it is the left hand 
    method - sex, drinks etc, why must it be practice=
d at all? Is it not a fact 
    that Sri Ambal lies above all these? </FONT=
