Namaste friends,
 
Prakash ji referred to raja gurus, raja jyotishis etc an=
d Sanjay ji to royal grants etc.
 
Yes, knowledgeable brahmanas with expert=
ise in various branches of knowledge have always been patronized by kings a=
nd influential people and granted various material benefits. The question i=
s what Braahmana should do in the absence of such patronage.
 
*        *  =
      *
 
Lord Krishna's words in SrimadBhagavatam 11.17 to Sri Uddhava giv=
e clear guidance in this matter (see http://vedabase.net/sb/11/17/ for orig=
inal Sanskrita verses).
 
SB 11.17.41: A brahmana who considers that accept=
ing charity from others will destroy his austerity and spiritual purity sho=
uld maintain himself by the other two brahminical occupations, namely teach=
ing Vedic knowledge and performing sacrifice. If the brahmana considers tha=
t those two occupations also compromise his spiritual position, then he sho=
uld collect rejected grains in agricultural fields and live without any dep=
endence on others.
 
SB 11.17.42: The body of a brahmana is not intended to=
 enjoy insignificant material sense gratification; rather, by accepting dif=
ficult austerities in his life, a brahmana will enjoy unlimited happiness a=
fter death.
 
SB 11.17.43: A brahmana householder should remain satisfied i=
n mind by gleaning rejected grains from agricultural fields and marketplace=
s. Keeping himself free of personal desire, he should practice magnanimous =
religious principles, with consciousness absorbed in Me. In this way a brah=
mana may stay at home as a householder without very much attachment and thu=
s achieve liberation.
 
SB 11.17.47: If a brahmana cannot support himself t=
hrough his regular duties and is thus suffering, he may adopt the occupatio=
n of a merchant and overcome his destitute condition by buying and selling =
*MATERIAL* things. If he continues to suffer extreme poverty even as a merc=
hant, then he may adopt the occupation of a kshatriya, taking sword in hand=
. But he cannot in any circumstances become a shudra.
 
*        *        *=

 
If one carefully reads SrimadBhagavatam 11.17, there is no confusion on =
what a Braahmana can and cannot do with Vedic knowledge. Accepting royal gr=
ants and other charity given voluntarily by others to support a braahmana (=
when one is satisfied with the spiritual purity of the giver) is fine. Teac=
hing Jyotish and other Vedic knowledge and performing rituals and taking vo=
luntary donation (when one is satisfied with the spiritual purity of the gi=
ver) is fine.
 
Otherwise, when not enough money is generated through Vedic=
 teaching and rituals and one is suffering, buying and selling material thi=
ngs (e.g. mathematics knowledge, software, TVs, accounting services etc) to=
 support oneself is fine.
 
But, setting price on Jyotish knowledge or othe=
r Vedic knowledge or rituals performed for gods is NOT fine for a *braahman=
a*. There cannot be two opinions on this, as the Lord Himself spoke clearly=
 to Uddhava in this manner!
 
*        *        *
 
Regarding the clause ab=
ove "when one is satisfied with the spiritual purity of the giver", an exam=
ple:
 
Swami Brahmananda was the spiritual son of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa a=
nd a friend of Lord Krishna in a previous incarnation as per Ramakrishna. W=
hen he was the head of the Ramakrishna mission, a rich man came to them. He=
 wanted to renounce and donate his entire wealth to Ramakrishna mission. Sw=
ami Brahmananda determined that taking that money would taint them and he r=
efused!
 
*        *        *
 
If some people are charging fixed fees for =
performing rituals like poojas and homas and abhishekas to relieve people o=
f their problems or charging fixed fees for teaching Jyotish or giving Jyot=
ish readings, it is their prerogative and we cannot (and should not) force =
them to change. One performs one's own karmas and reaps the fruits - tasty =
and bitter - of one's own karmas. Others cannot change it.
 
However, we ca=
n say that they are NOT being braahmanas, as per the guidelines of Lord Kri=
shna.
 
Though SB 11.17.40 says that Vedic knowledge can be taught and ritu=
als can be performed *only* by Braahmanas (here braahmana means one followi=
ng the code of conduct of a braahmana and not just one born in a so-called =
brahmana family), we seem to have a huge number of NON-braahmanas (by condu=
ct and not necessarily by birth) who are *selling* Jyotish knowledge and ri=
tual performance. It is not surprising, this being deepening Kali yuga!
 
T=
he best way to deal with them is not to attack them or call them names. If =
you want to buy what they are selling, buy it. If not, ignore them, leave t=
hem to their own fate and move on. YOU can follow the words of Lord, if you=
 have faith in Lord. But there is no need to impose them on others. Leave t=
hat to Lord!
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
