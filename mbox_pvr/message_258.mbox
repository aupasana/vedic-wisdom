  Namaste,

ore gone conclusion.   How

  It is debatable whether this is actually a fo=
regone conclusion or not. The times are different now than when NTR came. H=
owever, that is besides the point.

  Given that Chiranjeevi is said to be =
seriously considering political entry, this prediction, if made now, has a =
50% (or perhaps higher) chance. However, when the Express Star Teller artic=
le was written in August 2000, the chances of Chiranjeevi coming into polit=
ics in 2008-09 were not at all high. It was not a commonsense prediction, b=
ut made based just on the astrological principles I know.

  My purpose was=
 not to tout, though one may assume so. Because it is an interesting predic=
tion from 8 years back, I wanted to share it with fellow *fans of astrology=
*. This is about the greatness of Jyotish principles taught by Parasara and=
 other rishis and how beautifully they work sometimes, even when applied by=
 an idiot like me (my knowledge is small now but was even smaller in 2000 w=
hen this prediction was made). This is about Jyotish and not at all about m=
e. Though some people like me and praise me, I am realistic enough to know =
how little I know. Also, I did make many bad predictions in the past. Thus,=
 this is not at all about me and I have no reason to tout.
   
  Best regar=
ds,
  Narasimha
