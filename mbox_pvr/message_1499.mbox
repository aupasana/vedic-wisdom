Dear sir,
=A0
Further to this...last week it was the second time that there=
 was a stubborn log of wood that did not burn. Further to that this was the=
 1st time that I had to re-kindle the fire couple of times while in continu=
ance of the homa (I have completed a dozen homas by now...and this was the =
1st time that I had to re-kindle).
=A0
And again the strange experience of =
mental trauma and a perceived problem that took a lot of my attention and m=
ental peace. Though the problem was solved (I will perform one homa again t=
omorrow in which the stubborn stub would be burned)...it took the peace of =
my mind. Of course incessant prayers helped a little to give a semblance of=
 order to my emotions...but nevertheless what is strange is this experience=
.
=A0
After finishing the homa last week (in which that small stub did not =
burn) I was generally feeling unhappy because I was apprehensive about the =
entire experience of the homa - the unburnt wood...the rekindling (thrice).=
 I wanted to remove disturbing thoughts because i realised that it could be=
 mere psychological. What amazed me though that I found something strange i=
n me just after the homa.
=A0
I am that way pretty civil and good with etiq=
uettes. But just after the homa there was a blankness in my mind and I GORG=
ED at the homa fruit...(part of which I had given into the fire) with a str=
ange greed...more carnal (that is the exact explanation that I can give). A=
 part of my mind was looking at me strangely and saying what the heck was I=
 doing...but I was like an animal who just gorged on that fruit...having NO=
 RESPECT for it whatsover as if.
=A0
This is shocking because I have never =
noticed such a behaviour in me.
=A0
Well the problem at office is solved...=
and am much at peace...but this is a strange experience that I wish to shar=
e. with fellow members and you. And if there is any observation/advice that=
 you wish to let me know...please do..
=A0
Best wishes
Arunisha

Namaste,

Thank you for sharing. You are l=
ucky to have a conscience that guides you 
correctly. Listen to it and over=
come fear, shame, embarrasment etc.

Emotions like fear, embarassment, prid=
e, sadness, anger, desire etc are all 
natural to us. Cutting them off comp=
letely will take a long time. But one 
can atleast try to learn to not dwel=
l on them for too long. Normally, when a 
thought like embarassment or fear=
 or anger or pride disturbs the mental 
equilibrium, it will linger in the =
mind for a while. It will not go away 
quickly. Try to learn to move on, wi=
thout protesting or fighting with such 
thoughts. Take notice of the though=
t and move on without over-analyzing it. 
Don't feel great or bad about any=
 thought. Let the thought come and get its 
two seconds of space in your mi=
nd and then move on. Remember the analogy of 
a heckler I gave in a mail be=
fore. The distracting thoughts are like 
hecklers. Do not fight with them o=
r reason with them. Notice them, ignore 
them and move on.

When you do a s=
adhana, do not worry too much about the results. Having the 
results or som=
e expectations on the mind is an unnecessary distraction. If 
you conscious=
ly (but not violently or with a sense of shame or anger or 
disappointment)=
 steer you mind away from such negative thoughts during your 
sadhana, your=
 sadhana will become fruitful sooner or later.

Best regards,
Narasimha
