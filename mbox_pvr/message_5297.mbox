Namaste Sir,
 
> Where is the fascination for what one already has ?
 
The =
fascination is not "for what one already has", but for resisting changes in=
 that physical form with time based on the natural order (niyati)!
 
Strivi=
ng for physical immortality as a great ideal can create such an unhealthy f=
ascination that is not idealized in any scriptures.
 
All scriptures, wheth=
er it is Upanishads or Yoga Vaasishtham, say that you overcome your self-id=
entification with the perishable body and identify with that which cannot b=
e destroyed. Then you are liberated. After that, what happens to the body -=
 whether it remains invincible for a few millennia or for few million years=
 or forever or gets a cancer and perishies soon like in the case of Ramakri=
shna Paramahamsa and Ramana Maharshi - does not really matter, because you =
are not that body anyway.
 
> How do you know that this state is not achiev=
ed by actively pursuing it ?
 
(1) As I said, Yoga Vaasishtham and other sc=
riptures tell you to unidentify with the body to realize higher realities. =
They do talk about higher states beyond samdhi, but never tell you to think=
 of the physical body as you attempt to realize.
 
(2) Saints/yogis who asc=
ended to the immortal planes with their physical body (e.g. Sant Tukaram wh=
o was taken by Vishnu himself to Vaikuntha in his *physical* body to live t=
here forever!) never talked about such a pursuit. They only talked about su=
rrender to the Divine. They did not actively try to divinize their physical=
 being, but instead ignored it.
 
(3) The ones in scriptures who actively p=
ursued the divinization/immortalization of physical body did not succeed. F=
or example, king Trishanku wanted to ascend to the immortal plane in his ph=
ysical body. His family guru Maharshi Vasishtha refused to help him. Mahars=
hi Vishwamitra tried to help, but did not succeed!
 
> What is best course =
of action for one sadhaka,
> may not be the same for all others!
 
Yes, I t=
oo keep emphasizing it from time to time. But that applies to specifics. So=
me generic details are applicable to all. Certain fundamental mistakes can =
be costly to any sadhaka.
 
> > Once they are effaced, one flows with divin=
e will and is
>
> Do you ?
 
A fair question. My answer is no.
 
I was assu=
red by my guru that I can think of him or the Mother and answer spiritual q=
ueries of people confidently and I will end up writing things that would be=
 useful to people. That is why I write, as an instrument enabled by my guru=
. I am not a realized yogi myself. One can view me as a sign on the highway=
 that shows direction to Delhi. The sign itself may not have been to Delhi =
but it may still help some people reach Delhi, if it was installed correctl=
y and not disturbed by the winds (thoughts of one's own logical mind and in=
tuitive mind) too much.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

 But the rishi is in bliss whether he is alive or being killed, whether he =
