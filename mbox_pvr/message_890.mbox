    Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: gayatri mantra


    Nama=
ste,

    Veda mantras are in a different league compared to other mantras.=
 As I said 
    earlier, it is possible to achieve the one-pointed focus of=
 mind on any 
    combination of sounds. When one's mind repeats the same c=
ombination of 
    sounds over and over again, eventually one's mind may lo=
se all other 
    thoughts and become absorbed in that combination of sound=
s. THEN one's mind 
    experiences the energy represented by that combinat=
ion of sounds.

    Different combinations of sounds have different energie=
s. But experiencing 
    the energy of any combination of sounds is a bette=
r experience for the mind 
    than the regular chaotic experiences mind ha=
s in a cacaphony of thoughts.

    The energy represented by properly chant=
ed Veda mantras is in a different 
    league. However, it is almost imposs=
ible to chant Veda mantras perfectly in 
    today's times. The knowledge i=
s lost. The way people chant them, veda 
    mantras get corrupted and they=
 end up working like other mantras and do not 
    really act as veda mantr=
as. Even if one experiences a veda mantra, one 
    experiences the energy =
of a corrupted version and not of the original veda 
    mantra.

    The e=
xpression "Om bhur bhuvah suvah/svah" is not part of the actual savitru 
  =
  gayatri mantra. The actual veda mantra starts with "tat savitur" and ends=
 
    with "prachodayaat".

    I never recorded an audio clip of my Gayatr=
i chanting. I only hummed the ups 
    and downs to show the intonation. I =
was instructed to never chant Savitru 
    Gayatri mantra loud. Spiritually=
 speaking, that mantra is my food and I get 
    whatever little energy I h=
ave from it. In order to continue doing my dharma 
    in the world, I will=
 need to be selfish with my food. I can share everything 
    else with the=
 world.

    Astrology knowledge that we have on earth today is insufficien=
t to give 
    perfect guidance. A good guru may be able to do a better job=
 than astrology 
    as we understand it.

    I have seen my guru make som=
e interesting mantra suggestions. For example, I 
    once mentioned to Man=
ish a friend who visits me often and meditates when I 
    do homam. Manish=
 said, "he will not be interested in doing homam by himself. 
    If at all=
 he does, it will not be Mahaganapathi homam or Chandi homam. Teach 
    hi=
m Vishnu sahasra naama homam. He MAY be interested in that. He will like 
 =
   Vishnu sahasra naama stotram." I had not mentioned much about that perso=
n to 
    Manish and only said the name. Interestingly, Vishnu sahasra naam=
a stotra is 
    indeed a favorite prayer of that person. Another time, I m=
et a person who 
    loves Ganapathi atharva seersham and chants it everyda=
y and interested in 
    doing Mahaganapathi homam. Manish told me, "if he =
wants, he can do 
    Mahaganapathi homam. But eventually there is another =
sadhana he needs to do. 
    He needs to chant Hanuman Chalisa everyday 108=
 or 54 times for one whole 
    year. It will transform his life." I had no=
t mentioned anything about that 
    person to Manish. Interestingly, when =
this person was young, he was a sishya 
    of a great spiritual master in =
the lineage of Sadguru Samartha Ramadas 
    (considered to be born with Lo=
rd Hanuman's amsa). He said to me later that 
    his guru had also advised=
 him in the past to just stick to Hanuman chalisa! 
    Interestingly, the =
same suggestion came to Manish's mind.

    Of course, Manish tells me at o=
ther times that he knows nothing and says 
    whatever comes to his mind. =
If he ends up giving correct guidance to 
    someone, he says it is becaus=
e the Mother wanted someone to get correct 
    guidance and he is just a n=
imitta.

    I believe that a sadguru with very limited individual ego and =
in tune with 
    Nature will be able to give far better guidance in spirit=
ual sadhana than 
    astrology as we know it today.

    For Mars and Rahu=
 in 8th, I can suggest Lord Subrahmanya.

    Best regards,
    Narasimha

c-wisdom] gayatri 
    mantra<BR><BR>> dear narasimha ji and friends,<BR=
>> 
    namaste!<BR>><BR>> i understand that the syllables / metre=
 of the 
    mantra is very<BR>> important. that is why (probably) mantr=
a was passed 
    on from the guru<BR>> to ths sishya by word of mouth. =
somebody even said 
    that in the end<BR>> it is the metre only that r=
emains in the 
    mantra...and not even the<BR>> words. something like =
the smile of the 
    cheshire cat remaining even<BR>> when the cat itse=
lf vanishes in alice in 
    the wonderland.<BR>><BR>> i too have bee=
n looking at / bringing to my 
    consciousness the<BR>> gayatri mantra=
 of late. for lack of guidance, i 
    have been relying on<BR>> the int=
ernet. the first thing that kind of took 
    my breath away was<BR>> th=
e layers and layers of meaning attached to each 
    word of the<BR>> ma=
ntra. that is probably because all sanskrit words are 
    like<BR>> tha=
t....you peel one layer and another layer lies below..and 
    then<BR>>=
 still another and another....<BR>><BR>> but more 
    importantly (p=
erhaps) is the different ways this mantra<BR>> gets 
    recited. i trie=
d to count the syllables to see whether they<BR>> added 
    upto 24. th=
ey almost did, to my recknoning, but i wasn't sure<BR>> 
    whether om =
in the beginning is part of the mantra or not. it probaly<BR>> 
    is, =
but i want to be sure.<BR>><BR>> secondly, depending on who chants 
 =
   the mantra, the words<BR>> are "spelt" / "pronounced" differently. Fo=
r 
    instance in one<BR>> rendering i found "swah" being pronounced as=
 "suvah" 
    which becomes<BR>> two syllables instead of one. simarly, =
in the 
    same<BR>> rendering "prachodyat" is stretched to 3 syllables=
 instead of 
    2.<BR>><BR>> so i am confused as to the "right" 
   =
 rendition.<BR>><BR>> i recall, quite some time back, narsimha ji had=
 
    posted his rendition<BR>> of the gayatri mantra in an audio clip. =
i have 
    not been able to find<BR>> it again. but i wish he or someon=
e could guide 
    me about this.<BR>><BR>> i would also like to know=
 the importance of 
    the number of syllables<BR>> in each mantra and =
how this is suitable for 
    different persons<BR>> depending on their =
"karmic structures" which are 
    sometimes / always<BR>> (?) reflected=
 in the astrological chart. maybe a 
    guru by just<BR>> looking at a =
person can know intuitively what is the 
    "right" mantra<BR>> for the=
 person. maybe a good astrologer can also do 
    the same.<BR>><BR>>=
 i know this is not an astrology forum, but still i 
    am seeking<BR>>=
 guidance on "appeasement" of mars and rahu in 8th house 
    and retro<BR>=
> saturn in 6th house for taurus lagna...throough mantra. 
    These<BR>=
> planets aspect all the other planets (jupiter, sun and mercury 
    in=
<BR>> 2nd house and venus moon in third house).<BR>><BR>> 
    tha=
nkyou!<BR>><BR>> love and best wishes,'<BR>>
