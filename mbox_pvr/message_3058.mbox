Dear All,
=C2=A0
It is a nice point you have raised about the writings of S=
ri Aurobindo. This is something I have always found quite perplexing, his c=
laim on "descent of supermind" which, supposedly no one has ever tried befo=
re.
=C2=A0
In the volumes he has written - which are fascinating stuff no d=
oubt - he has intellectually tried to grade different aspects of matter, li=
fe, spirituality and God. 
=C2=A0
IN my limited understanding, I find all o=
f it to be intellectually fine except this idea of the supramental descent,=
 or why and how it is really different from a Sahaja Samadhi or the Kundali=
ni coming down from Sahashra chakra. 
=C2=A0
If someone could explain to me=
 in simple terms who his Yoga is any different from what has been achieved =
by Nath Yogis of old, I would be highly indebted.
=C2=A0
Interestingly, Sri=
 Ramana Maharishi was asked about this by one of Sri Aurobindo's disciples =
and rejected the idea of Supramental Descent. 
=C2=A0
Also, Sri Aurobindo c=
onsidered the path of Dattatreya (Aghora) to be deluded and insufficient. H=
e says so during a conversation. 
=C2=A0
Sometimes I feel, the only one hav=
ing real fun is Mahamaya. Even the best can be deluded by Her.

Dear Utpal,

Even Vasishtha says there is a state beyond sahaja samadhi=
 in Yoga 
Vaasishtham, but does not describe it. However, he does not say t=
hat it 
cannot be achieved on earth.

Bhava samadhi, savikalpa samadhi, nir=
vikalpa samadhi etc can be 
intellectually understood and appreciated even =
without experiencing them. 
But other samadhis cannot be understood intelle=
ctually.

Best regards,
Narasimha
