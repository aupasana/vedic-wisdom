>>Namaste friends,=C2=A0Bhakti yoga or the path of surren=
der and devotion is indeed more suitable in this age. I did not mean to say=
 otherwise.=C2=A0But just having an ishta devata is not enough to be "prote=
cted" from deep and troublesome instabilities when one's body-mind complex =
goes through a big transformation. Not every aspiring devotee becomes a Pra=
hlada - some become Ravanas. After all, out of the two examples Leelaji gav=
e below for "psychological disorder", the second lady "did much sadhana of =
Srirama". Even those who think of a deity and pray to him/her can end up wi=
th hallucinations, mental and spiritual disorders, wrong (colored by one's =
conditioning and desires!) interpretation of internal/external experiences =
and even madness.=C2=A0True surrender/devotion to ishta devata will definit=
ely protect one, but cultivating it is as difficult as cultivating detachme=
nt through wisdom! In fact, true surrender and detachment are almost the sa=
me.=C2=A0This is why I said
 that *lightness of conditioning* is the most i=
mportant thing. One with dense conditioning will find SOME way to fail even=
 if a great guru or god are ready to help.=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=

the question is: How do we reduce our conditioning? Unfortunately, there is=
 no single magic bullet. Thinking of a god, mantras, bhajans, japam, homam =
etc can help, but they need to be augmented by regular introspection and se=
lf-improvement.=C2=A0Taking mind away from its current pre-occupations (e.g=
. "I am smart", "I am doing good sadhana", "I am mad at X", "I did not get =
what I deserve in Y", "I am better than X", "I must have Y at any cost" etc=
 etc) is key to eventually overcoming conditioning, for these thoughts keep=
 *reinforcing* the conditioning!=C2=A0To reduce the regular pre-occupations=
 of mind, different imagery/visualization may work better for some people.=
=C2=A0One approach is to contemplate god whenever possible, in the middle o=
f any activity. You can
 imagine a being in your mind, either as an ideal/a=
ble person or as a principle/ideal/ability that exists in many beings, that=
 is so perfect and fascinating for the mind to contemplate that it does not=
 care about other objects around that are making shadripus and ashtapashas =
work on the mind. Whenever mind is about to entertain its regular debilitat=
ing pre-occupations, one can try to contemplate god instead.=C2=A0Mind is a=
 wild animal. As Pi says in the movie "Life of Pi" about the tiger on the b=
oat, wild animals can't be transformed or domesticated, but they can be tra=
ined into some habits!=C2=A0Whenever one is enjoying a sensual pleasure, if=
 one thinks "the omnipresent God is enjoying this thru this instrument" and=
 starts contemplating the qualities of that god instead of thinking too muc=
h about limited sense objects, one is better placed to reduce the damage do=
ne by shadripus. Whenever one is angry at someone for what they did, if one=
 thinks "the omnipresent
 God is giving me the fruits of my karmas thru tha=
t instrument" and starts contemplating the qualities of that god instead of=
 being angry at someone, one is better placed to reduce the damage done by =
shadripus. And so on.=C2=A0In the beginning, even contemplation of god beco=
mes laced with ego. Every now and then, the activity ends up becoming about=
 oneself rather than about god ("*I* am doing this nice bhajan", "*I* am do=
ing this nice homam", "I think *I* am making progress through this"). With =
effort and perseverance, one can avoid making it about oneself and keep it =
centered on the supreme power that runs the show. Just as it takes a long t=
ime to train a wild animal, it takes a long time to train mind!=C2=A0Try to=
 develop devotion and surrender. Based on all that you read and heard, deve=
lop of a concept/principle of god that is so superb and fascinarting. Visua=
lize/contemplate that concept as frequently as possible, especially when me=
ditating. When mind veers
 off into other things, gently steer it back. Don=
't spend too much time dissecting what mind is doing and why. Just put it b=
ack gently into contemplating god. Try to make it about god rather than abo=
ut yourself.=C2=A0The main drawback of the sadhana of most people is that t=
hey make it about themselves at some level or the other. Though that is una=
voidable, try to break free from it.=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0Finally, on=
e can try to overcome the limited sense of self and engage in selfless acti=
ons that benefit a larger set of people than oneself. What stops us from tr=
uly loving god is our deep and sub-conscious love for *ourselves* (i.e. our=
 *limited* notion of self that drives the current body-mind complex). One w=
ay to overcome that is to selflessly love others. After all, other people a=
round us are as much replicas of god as we are. If we cannot empathize with=
 them, love them and give them unconditionally, how can we ever hope to tra=
nscend the
 limited sense of Self and truly love omnipresent God?=C2=A0

Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, one has to now self iden=

en up the mind and body to various other things and entities, some of which=
 are not postive in nature while some of them are useless, and given half a=
 chance can make use of the individual for its own ends. They take hold of =
inhernent weakness in character and nature and miss-utilizes the same. Henc=
e constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more
 vital. 4 - While someday or othe=
r every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini Shakti awekening and r=
ising up, not all maladies of psychology are because of this. The human psy=
chology as understood by west today is puerile and insufficient to deal wit=
h various things. It is also possible sometimes that the aura of an individ=
ual, which protects us from various subtle influences and helps us to remai=
n as functional entities, can get "ruptured" due to various reasons, high s=
tress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can allow free assess=
 of various entities inside the mind and they have chances of causing serio=
us havoc. Since all these are very complex and various possiblities are the=
re, it is not possible to list down every option. Moreover, even if such a =
diagnosis is correctly done, very few can have the right knowledge to recti=
fy the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are often doing nothing mo=
re than an intelligent guess work.
 Sometimes it will have results, sometim=

>>>>>>Dear all, Just wanted to warn=
 people of kundalini syndrome based on my recent experience of a patient of=
 mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at present, and have been involved in th=
e care of someone who seems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening of=
 their kundalini since childhood. This has involved out-of-body experiences=
 and surges of energy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had neve=
r heard of kundalini until her symptoms started and she searched for an exp=
lanation. We have not been able to find anything physically wrong with her =
(all tests normal)- so it might be that this is due to deranged kundalini. =
Many people we call mentally ill describe themselves as having a spiritual =
crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered int=
erest and research into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately =
these patients are not well-understood by western medicine, and as we have =
no treatments for deranged
 kundalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis=
 try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My experience with this lady confirme=
d my feeling that kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman want=
s to kill herself at times because the suffering from the deranged energy i=
s so bad. She feels it will consume her, and it is something she cannot esc=
ape from. I wondered what solution there could be to her problem. The logic=
al one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to =
relieve the suffering of this woman- and either cure her, or give her the s=
trength to bear this. May I request that the good samaritans among you pray=
 for her, and for others like her (whom we may not know of)- their sufferin=
g really is pitiable. And let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end=
 up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is th=
e safest. It is perhaps safest to say "let me be your instrument" and leave=
 the kundalini
 rising bit to God's will. Om Dum Durgayai Namaha Aparna

bsp;<WBR>Bhakti yoga or the path of surrender and devotion is indeed more s=
uitable in this age. I did not mean to say otherwise.<WBR> <WBR>But ju=
st having an ishta devata is not enough to be "protected" from deep and tro=
ublesome instabilities when one's body-mind complex goes through a big tran=
sformation. Not every aspiring devotee becomes a Prahlada - some become Rav=
anas. After all, out of the two examples Leelaji gave below for "psychologi=
cal disorder", the second lady "did much sadhana of Srirama". Even those wh=
o think of a deity and pray to him/her can end up with hallucinations, ment=
al and spiritual disorders, wrong (colored by one's conditioning and desire=
s!) interpretation of internal/external experiences and even madness.<WBR>&=
nbsp;<WBR>True surrender/devotion to ishta devata will definitely protect o=
ne, but
 cultivating it is as difficult as cultivating detachment through w=
isdom! In fact, true surrender and detachment are almost the same.<WBR>&nbs=
p;<WBR>This is why I said that *lightness of conditioning* is the most impo=
rtant thing. One with dense conditioning will find SOME way to fail even if=
 a great guru or god are ready to help.<WBR> <WBR>*   &=
nbsp;    *        *<WBR>&=
nbsp;<WBR>Now, the question is: How do we reduce our conditioning? Unfortun=
ately, there is no single magic bullet. Thinking of a god, mantras, bhajans=
, japam, homam etc can help, but they need to be augmented by regular intro=
spection and self-improvement.<WBR> <WBR>Taking mind away from its cur=
rent pre-occupations (e.g. "I am smart", "I am doing good sadhana", "I am m=
ad at X", "I did not get what I deserve in Y", "I am better than X", "I mus=
t have Y at any cost" etc etc) is key to eventually overcoming conditioning=
,
 for these thoughts keep *reinforcing* the conditioning!<WBR> <WBR>T=
o reduce the regular pre-occupations of mind, different imagery/visualizati=
on may work better for some people.<WBR> <WBR>One approach is to conte=
mplate god whenever possible, in the middle of any activity. You can imagin=
e a being in your mind, either as an ideal/able person or as a principle/id=
eal/ability that exists in many beings, that is so perfect and fascinating =
for the mind to contemplate that it does not care about other objects aroun=
d that are making shadripus and ashtapashas work on the mind. Whenever mind=
 is about to entertain its regular debilitating pre-occupations, one can tr=
y to contemplate god instead.<WBR> <WBR>Mind is a wild animal. As Pi s=
ays in the movie "Life of Pi" about the tiger on the boat, wild animals can=
't be transformed or domesticated, but they can be trained into some habits=
!<WBR> <WBR>Whenever one is enjoying a sensual pleasure, if one
 think=
s "the omnipresent God is enjoying this thru this instrument" and starts co=
ntemplating the qualities of that god instead of thinking too much about li=
mited sense objects, one is better placed to reduce the damage done by shad=
ripus. Whenever one is angry at someone for what they did, if one thinks "t=
he omnipresent God is giving me the fruits of my karmas thru that instrumen=
t" and starts contemplating the qualities of that god instead of being angr=
y at someone, one is better placed to reduce the damage done by shadripus. =
And so on.<WBR> <WBR>In the beginning, even contemplation of god becom=
es laced with ego. Every now and then, the activity ends up becoming about =
oneself rather than about god ("*I* am doing this nice bhajan", "*I* am doi=
ng this nice homam", "I think *I* am making progress through this"). With e=
ffort and perseverance, one can avoid making it about oneself and keep it c=
entered on the supreme power that runs the show. Just as it
 takes a long t=
ime to train a wild animal, it takes a long time to train mind!<WBR> <=
WBR>Try to develop devotion and surrender. Based on all that you read and h=
eard, develop of a concept/principle of god that is so superb and fascinart=
ing. Visualize/contemplate that concept as frequently as possible, especial=
ly when meditating. When mind veers off into other things, gently steer it =
back. Don't spend too much time dissecting what mind is doing and why. Just=
 put it back gently into contemplating god. Try to make it about god rather=
 than about yourself.<WBR> <WBR>The main drawback of the sadhana of mo=
st people is that they make it about themselves at some level or the other.=
 Though that is unavoidable, try to break free from it.<WBR> <WBR>*&nb=
sp;       *     &nbs=
p;  *<WBR> <WBR>Finally, one can try to overcome the limited sens=
e of self and engage in selfless actions that benefit
 a larger set of peop=
le than oneself. What stops us from truly loving god is our deep and sub-co=
nscious love for *ourselves* (i.e. our *limited* notion of self that drives=
 the current body-mind complex). One way to overcome that is to selflessly =
love others. After all, other people around us are as much replicas of god =
as we are. If we cannot empathize with them, love them and give them uncond=

antra, to focus on Kundalini, one needs a few things going. 1 - Bhuta Suddh=
i. Constant efforts of purification of the various elements that compose th=
e human mind-body structure. In simpler words this translates into more det=
achment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, gr=
eed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, one has=
 to now self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a far=
 more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 - =
A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really does=
 - it can also open up the mind and body to various other things and entiti=
es, some of which are not postive in nature while some of them are useless,=
 and given half a chance can make
 use of the individual for its own ends. =
They take hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and miss-utili=

e someday or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini Shakt=
i awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are because of th=
is. The human psychology as understood by west today is puerile and insuffi=

ura of an individual, which protects us from various subtle influences and =
helps us to remain as functional entities, can get "ruptured" due to variou=

allow free assess of various entities inside the mind and they have chances=
 of causing serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and various pos=
siblities are there, it is not possible to list down every option. Moreover=
, even if such a diagnosis
 is correctly done, very few can have the right =
knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are ofte=

<DIV>Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome =
based on my recent experience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry=
 job at present, and have been involved in the care of someone who seems to=
 think she has had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since childho=
od. This has involved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the b=
ody. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini until her=
 symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. We have not been abl=
e to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it migh=
t be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally i=
ll describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneou=
s kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest and research into this t=
opic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-un=
derstood by western medicine, and as we have no treatments for deranged
 ku=
ndalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kun=
dalini. My experience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini sh=
ould not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at times bec=
ause the suffering from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will co=
nsume her, and it is something she cannot escape from. I wondered what solu=
tion there could be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divi=
ne Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this =
woman- and either cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. May I re=
quest that the good samaritans among you pray for her, and for others like =
her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. And let =
us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ourselve=
s. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest=
 to say "let me be your instrument" and leave the kundalini
 rising bit to =
God's will. Om Dum Durgayai Namaha Aparna </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></D=
