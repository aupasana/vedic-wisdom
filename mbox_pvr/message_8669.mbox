Namaste Sir,
=A0
Great questions!
=A0
> Expecting to get the different vers=
ions of the=A0 answers...
=A0
Seeing that you did not get even one version =
:-( of the answers, here are my 2 cents:
=A0
1-3: Our actions generate equa=
l and opposite reactions. World gives you back what you give it. Only trick=
y thing is that there is a time lag. What you are getting today is the frui=
t of your actions in the past, from yesterday or from one year back or from=
 a decade back or from last life or from 10 lives back.
=A0
Imagine a big p=
ipe containing many balls. You are throwing balls into the pipe and balls c=
ome out. Balls don't necessarily come out in the same order in which you th=
row them in. Also, when you throw a big and heavy enough ball into the pipe=
, it may result in some re-arrangement of balls already in the pipeline. Si=
milarly, big karmas (good or bad) done now may result in re-arrangement of =
the karma pipeline.
=A0
If the pipe has only good balls, only good balls co=
me out. If the pipe has only bad balls, only bad balls come out. If it has =
both, any may come out. If a bad ball comes out as soon as you throw a good=
 ball in, it does not mean the ball you threw just now was a bad ball. It m=
eans the good ball you threw will take some time to come. Moreover, it was =
YOU who threw the bad ball that just came out, in the past.
=A0
A ritual do=
ne with a negative attitude for bad purposes can be a bad karma. However, e=
ven if one did a good ritual, still that good karma need not give results i=
mmediately. It depends on how dense one's karma pipeline is. If a pipe has =
very small balls and a big heavy ball is thrown into it very fast, it may p=
ush through previous existing balls and come out quickly. But, if a pipe ha=
s a lot of heavy balls, your currently thrown ball will be stuck behind the=
m. So it all depends on one's karma pipeline.
=A0
I will answer the rest of=
 the questions in another installment.
=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

Dear=
 All Learned members, 
Following are my questions: 
1. After effect of Homa=
m can be negative also. Is it true? 
2. Persons who do nothing=A0 in the fi=
eld of spirituality can also meet God, higher saints. How is it possible? 
=
3. I was reading=A0 a newspaper that people after having darshan of Mata Va=
ishno Devi, Kedarnaath, etc=A0 , while returning, met with accident and die=
d. Why does this happen? People have just come from a such a wonderful dars=
han then why tragedy strikes them. 
4. People who are married and have the =
wife and kid as responsibilities. Fulfilling the duties of husband is a blo=
ckage in the spiritual path. You know=A0 what i mean. =A0
5. Why=A0 did Gau=
tam Buddha=A0 left his wife and his child and even then achieved the status=
 of God? 
6. A common person gives=A0 a damn to the concept of liberation. =
When ever i=A0 have discussion with people in my office they think=A0 i am =
mad . How should one deal with that because i=A0 think that people=A0 who a=
re unaware of this great concept should be taught with this ideaology. 

Ex=
pecting to get the different versions of the=A0 answers...!!! 

Just Gaurav=
