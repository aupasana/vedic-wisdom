Namaste Sir,
=A0
Here are my 2 cents.

=A0
Puranic stories are symbolic/met=
aphorical representations of subtle inner truths. Taking them at face value=
 is not useful. One needs to understand the subtle inner meanings and "dige=
st" them in in one's attitude.
=A0
The word indriya (sense) comes from Indr=
a. Whatever we perceive through the senses falls under the dominion of Indr=
a. After all, Lord Indra personifies the enjoyment of sense objects within =
each being! If I see something and think "this is so beautiful" or "this is=
 so disgusting", the thought and its fruit fall under the dominion of Indra=
.
=A0
Now, when one does japam or some other spiritual practice, one is sup=
posed to focus the attention so much on the deity/mantra that senses are sh=
ut down nearly completely (operational just enough to enable the practice).=
 If one is having other thoughts related to sense objects while doing sadha=
na, the fruits, my friend, will obviously go to Indra, who personifies the =
enjoyment of sense objects!!!
=A0
Now, you don't have to really physically =
get up from your aasana (seat or rather posture) and go somewhere. Even you=
r mind getting up from its stable *posture* and going somewhere is enough f=
or the fruits of your sadhana to be diverted!
=A0
Water is symblic of actio=
ns (the Vedic word "ap" means both water and work). Ring finger stands for =
dharma (little finger - kaama, middle finger - artha, index finger - moksha=
). Touching water under aasana with middle finger and applying on the third=
 eye symbolizes basing one's focus on some sense of purpose and have a clea=
r vision of dharmik actions towards that sense of purpose.
=A0
The idea of =
this story is to remind us that we need firmness and focus of mind and body=
 and control the senses. When senses are in contact with their objects, we =
should have a clear vision of our sense of purpose and dharma, so that we a=
re not deluded by sense objects and focus on our dharmik actions. Otherwise=
, our efforts will be wasted in the enjoyment of sense objects.

=A0
Of cou=
rse, if one wants, one can follow the instructions in this story literally.=
 Especially if one has this guilty feeling that one is doing something wron=
g, that will be counter-productive. After all, rituals are mind games and y=
ou want to create a desired state of mind by manipulating surroundings and =
cajoling mind to behave in a way. It is better to just do whatever it takes=
 to remove that guilty feeling. But, IMHO, it is far more important in the =
long run to understand the inner meaning and "digest" it in one's *attitude=
*.

=A0Best regards,

Narasimha

 That's why many a times, I have been asked why is that one is praying to G=
od for so long with no benefit or fruit of that devotion. Why God is not li=
stening? Well, when I explain the above story to them, it raises their eyeb=
rows. When they adopt this simple act, they start seeing results! The benef=
it or fruit of their devotion remain with them, forever!
>>
