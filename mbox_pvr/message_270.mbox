Namaste,

I think the book you mentioned is supposed to be an shorter version of the 
book I mentioned. I read only the latter.

It is available on Amazon and I gave the link below. I do not know about 
physical book stores.

If you can only buy this book, you can considering buying it instead also.

Best regards,
Narasimha
