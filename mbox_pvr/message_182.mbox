Namaste dear Sundeep ji,
 
> Your statement about "worshipping the gem 
> i=
nstead" has really gotten me confused. My assumption until now was 
> that =
gems are tantrik remedies at the level of controlling the body.
 
Gem is an=
 external object that contains some energy related to a particular planet. =
If you make it a part of your body (by wearing it), you are putting yoursel=
f (body and mind) under extra influence of that planet. If that planet's in=
fluence on your mind is one that makes you elated, the gem may elate you. I=
f that planet's influence on your mind is one that makes you sad, the gem m=
ay sadden you.
 
On the other hand, if you invoke a deity in a gem, gem is =
akin to an idol. As the gem contains the energy related to a planet, your i=
nvocation of a deity who is related to that planet will result in some of t=
hat deity's energy entering the gem for a small time. If you offer a mantra=
 related to that deity in the presence of that energy, that will please tha=
t deity and strengthen an aspect of your self represented by that deity. Th=
is in turn makes the planet more favorable to you. As you strengthen, with =
mantra, an aspect of your self represented by a deity associated with a pla=
net, that planet becomes more favorable. Negative results become smaller in=
 magnitude and positive results become magnified.
 
Let us try an analogy t=
o clarify further.
 
Wearing a gem is akin to bringing someone to your hous=
e and keeping him in your house. If he likes you, he will make your life ha=
ppy. If he does not like you, he will make your life miserable.
 
Praying t=
o a deity corresponding to a planet is akin to getting help from somebody w=
ho has influence on that person, so that the person behaves better with you=
 due to that influence
 
Chanting the mantra of a planet or its deity in fr=
ont of the gem before wearing the gem is akin to keeping a person in the co=
mpany of somebody who has influence over him before bringing him to your ho=
use, so that he is influenced sufficiently.
 
In your case, Mercury has cer=
tain weaknesses and emerald is a dicey choice for you. However, if you offe=
r enough mantra of Lord Ramachandra in front of that gem, it should become =
more favorable to you and actually eventually give you the result of the ra=
ja yoga between Sun and Mercury. Hence my advice..
 
These are my 2 cents.
=
 
> I dont want to blindly do it, but I am saving this advice 
> for a litt=
le later hopefully when I am a little more spiritually 
> advanced.
 
Logic=
al. Of course, it is totally upto you.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
