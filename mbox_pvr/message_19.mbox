Namaste friends,

We are living in Kali yuga and Kali is becoming deeper. We cannot trust that 
every standard convention is based on sound knowledge.

*        *        *

One of my favorite sooktas is "Devi Sooktam" from Rigveda. It is attributed 
to Vagambhrani, a female rishi. She felt oneness with the Divine Mother in 
Her undivided supreme form (nearly nirguna form) and the riks of Devi 
sooktam were revealed to her then. Those eight riks are really fantastic.

There are other riks in Rigveda that were revealed to the world by female 
rishis. We use those riks in our worship, meditation, homas and other 
sadhanas. Yet, should we insist that women cannot recite Veda? If 
Vagambhrani is amid us again as a woman, should we stop her from reciting 
Devi sooktam?

*        *        *

Jnaneshwar (or Jnanadev) was a great saint from Maharashtra from about 800 
years back. He was a great devotee of Krishna and was a fully self-realized 
master at a young age. He reformed religion and corrected some corrupt 
traditions. He once made a buffalo chant Veda.

He started to recite Veda and the head of the Brahmin council forbade him 
because he was not "qualified" to recite Veda. Jnaneshwar insisted that 
everyone had a right to recite Veda and the head of the council disagreed. 
As he started reciting Veda, the Brahmins tried to stop him by closing his 
mouth. Then a buffalo standing next to him took over and chanted Veda. 
Astounded by the miracle, the Brahmins fell at his feet. The head apologized 
and said, "we are masquerading as the keepers of Veda, but you have the real 
understanding and mastery of Veda".

Jnaneshwar taught the equality of all and did not distinguish between people 
based on caste, creed or gender. He considered BhagavadGita as the essence 
of Veda and wrote a fantastic commentary on it. His commentary departs from 
the standard Dwaitic (dualistic) point of view adopted by most Vaishnava 
gurus and uses a purely Adwaitic (non-dualistic) point of view. It is a 
priceless and timeless masterpiece.

One Swamiji who was at my house last month had an interesting take. He said 
that the belief that women cannot recite Vedas is based on a 
misinterpretation. He said that the physical body we have is called the 
"stree sareera" and the inner body we have is called the "purusha sareera". 
He said that the physical body comes from mother and the soul comes from 
father and that is why they are called so. The soul or inner self is the 
thousand-headed purusha within us (described in purusha sooktam).

He said that Veda is supposed to be recited with the purusha sareera. 
According to him, it does not mean that women cannot read it. Whether men or 
women, they have to read it with the purusha sareera, i.e. inner body, and 
not just with the physical body. So, according to him, the standard 
convention is based on a flawed understanding. According to him, one simply 
reciting Veda with the mouth without the correct internal understanding is 
only reading with the "stree sareera" and hence not doing the right thing.

*        *        *

In fact, reciting Veda and chanting the verses is one thing and 
understanding them is quite another. When we make sound, there are four 
levels of it - vaikhari, madhyama, pasyanti and para. Vibration of material 
belonging to the gross body (sthoola sareera) produces vaikhari level of 
sound and it is heard through the senses belonging to the gross body (ears). 
But vibrations at the level of subtle body (sookshma sareera) and vibrations 
at the level of astral body (kaarana sareera) are also there and can be 
perceived thorough subtle perception.

If one is chanting "Om Namo Narayanaya" and thinking of some mundane 
matters, the vibrations produced at levels above vaikhari will not be 
auspicious. There is so much stress on what we do physically and people 
forget that what happens at the other layers of existence is equally, if not 
more, important!

If you produce the correct vibrations at all levels (not just physical) 
while "reciting" any Vedic mantra, you can truly "experience" the mantra. A 
full experience of a single Vedic mantra may be sufficient to alter one's 
life! The mantras of Veda are most powerful. Unfortunately, so much of Vedic 
scholarship these days is only superficial (but it has to be encouraged, 
because it will keep atleast one level of knowledge alive).

Forget the man vs woman controversy. The difference between genders is only 
in the gross body. When you go to the subtle body and astral body, there is 
no difference at all. One should realize that the role of gross body is too 
limited in the correct recitation/experience of a Vedic mantra. It is the 
purity of the subtle body and the lightness of the astral body that are far 
more important.

*        *        *

To be fair and balanced, I need to throw light on the other angle. Like I 
said, Vedic mantras are too powerful. They are capable of producing a full 
self-realization (actually the sole purpose of Veda is "to know self"). 
However, given the depth of Kali Yuga, it is difficult for it to come in one 
shot. It comes in steps. When one is half way down the path, one has to be 
careful and under the vigilant guidance of a sadguru.

When one is not fully realized and the gross body has a role to play, there 
are some differences based on the gender that come into play.

If a lady carrying a baby in her womb has certain spiritual experiences 
(which a good Vedic chanting is capable of bringing), there can even be an 
abortion (or a great siddha being born, on the other extreme).

There is another subtle factor. Good Vedic chanting can bring an awakening 
of Kundalini (i.e. an awakening of self-awareness) and an ascent of 
Kundalini (i.e. an ascent of self-awareness). Though some people may have a 
wrong impression about Kundalini because of the corrupt practices of a 
section of so-called "Kundalini sadhakas", the fact is that Kundalini merely 
represents one's ego-consciousness. When one casually associates the body 
one sees with "self", Kundalini is asleep in the Mooladhara chakra. As one's 
self-awareness becomes more and more refined, Kundalini ascends in the 
sookshma sareera. As one has a perfect self-realization, Kundalini reaches 
Sahasrara. Whether one thinks in these terms or not, Kundalini moves based 
on how evolved one is. Whether one is into Bhakti yoga or Raja yoga or Karma 
yoga or Jnana yoga does not matter. All paths lead to an awareness of a more 
and more correct concept of self as time progresses and a full 
self-realization finally. Accordingly, Kundalini rises more and more and 
reaches Sahasrara at the end.

During the period when Kundalini is stuck in Swadhishthana chakra, sexual 
drive can multiply. Several yogis get stuck in this stage and fail the tests 
to progress further. In general, women have a higher drive than men. If that 
drive multiplies, there can be a difficult situation. However, it really 
depends on the individual and we cannot generalize.

Thus, there are some practical difficulties on the way, which may have made 
some people come up with some rules. However, are those issues sufficient to 
ban women from reciting Veda? I don't think so. In fact, the factors I wrote 
above are probably irrelevant given the superficial understanding of Veda 
present at this time and the superficial recitation of Veda that we find 
these days.

But, if you want to be sure and do not want to misguide anyone, it is better 
to not give any advice. Leave it to one's sadguru. If you have a sadguru who 
is guiding your spiritual sadhana, surrender and do as your guru says! What 
is good for goose may not be good for gander. What goose's guru taught to 
goose may be good only for goose and not for gander. Gander will do well to 
follow gander's guru.

I think I rambled enough for today... :-)

Best regards,
Narasimha
