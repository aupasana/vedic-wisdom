Dear Narasimha-ji,
The finding of a huge quantity of precious gemstones in =
the Padmanabha Swamy temple at Trivandrum might also point towards the sign=
ificance of such stones for spiritual and astrological ends in the ancient =
times. Of course, the commercial value of such stones can't be disputed. Ke=
rala has always served as the bedrock of astrology and the Travancore kings=
 were also patrons of this divine science. This episode,=C2=A0coupled with =
your enlightening mails on Kavachas,=C2=A0brings to my mind some queries/cu=
riosities.
Could you share your views/experiences of the use of gemstones w=
orn as finger-rings for astrological remedial/spiritual purposes. Are they =
at all to be used as per any tenets of our Shastras? I had used a Pukhraj a=
bout 16 years back. I found it giving several beneficial (enhanced spiritua=
l and material well-being) as well as adverse effects in the two years that=
 I used it. Have never used any gemstone after that though, and have only b=
een concentrating on japams since.=C2=A0
Can you bring to light some of the=
 references to the use of gemstones for astrological remedial or spiritual =
purposes, if contained in our ancient Shastras or Jyotish texts?=C2=A0

=C2=A0 Namaste,

 Please do not answer this with answers like "faith" or "fate" 
When Viveka=
nanda first met Margaret Noble (Sister Nivedita), he told her that religion=
 should not be a matter of "faith", but a matter of "experience". In the be=
ginning, one may start with blind faith, but eventually one has to know by =
experience. Otherwise, it is not of much use. The problem in the world righ=
t now is that there are many relgions led by people who have not experience=
d god in any manner and yet leading people. This has resulted in people fig=
hting and killing in the name of god. 
* * * 
Anyway, coming back to your q=
uestion, I did not say planetary kavachas are a much. In fact, I said Chand=
i kavacham and Narayana kavacham are better for most people. In fact, any p=
rayer can protect one, if one does with enough intensity for enough duratio=
n. 
* * * 
I never said or will say that doing a=C2=A0 particular ritual or=
 mantra is the only way to solve a particular problem or to experience a pa=
rticular aspect of god. Just as one can reach a mountain top from various s=
ides using various paths, one can reach god using various paths. God is not=
 elsewhere, but within us. But, the conditioning accumulated thru many live=
s makes us look at things with attraction and aversion and mind vibrates wi=
th attraction, aversion, pride, shame, anger, jealosy etc. If mind becomes =
nearly still, one can be in bliss and the divine energy within expresses ou=
tside. The goal of various relgions is to take the mind to that state. 
The=
re are many ways to facilitate that. Chanting a sacred combinations of syll=
ables with a focused mind is one way. In my opinion, one can achieve one-po=
intedness of mind with any syllable combination. Mind achieving one-pointed=
ness with any mantra and/or mental imagery is a good thing. But=C2=A0 depen=
ding the mantra/imagery, a different kind of energy envelopes that focused =
mind, purifies it and affects it. It just so happens that many great realiz=
ed yogis came on the blessed land of India and cataloged many mantras and i=
magery. In other religions also, many people have experienced one-pointedne=
ss of mind on a thought/imagery/sound combination and experienced divinity.=
 A muslim can take a surah from Quran and meditate with it. In fact, some s=
ufi saints did experience divinity like that. Also, there are paths other t=
han meditation. Serving others and trying to see god in all is a valid path=
 too. Oneday, mind can experience god that way too. 
While other areas of t=
he world had their share of realized souls, India had just too many of them=
. What is known today as Hinduism has a rich library of knowledge from thei=
r experiences and revelations. One can try a path that was traversed by oth=
ers and=C2=A0 is well-understood. It does not mean those on the other side =
of the mountain are doomed. 
* * * 
> doing homams or not doing homams or a=
ny other hindu worship method 
Japam and homam are not the monopoly of any =
religion and not just "Hindu worship methods". People who meditated with sp=
ecial chants and experienced ecstasy, bliss and inner divinity came in ever=
y part of the world and in every religion. 
As for homam, sacredness of fir=
e and the ability to connect to the divine faster when using fire, was know=
n to many religions. Not only Hindus, but native Americans worshipped god i=
n fire, Zoroastrians did it, ancient Greco-Romans did it, some Buddhists di=
d it, some south Americans did it, some Scandinavians did it, and so on. Th=
ere are references in Bible of even Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Moses h=
aving worshipped god in fire. For example, GENESIS 8:20 says "And Noah buil=
ded an=C2=A0 altar unto the Lord; and took of every clean beast, and of eve=
ry clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar". The Korban Olah (=
"whole offering") of Judaism, where a whole animal was burnt in fire, is ve=
ry similar to "poornaahuti" (whole offering) of homam where a full coconut =
symbolizing head or ego is burnt in fire. The seven candles of minorah, an =
integral part of judaism, remind us of the seven tongues of Agni. 
New Test=
ament refers to baptism with fire (baptism is purification by sprinkling or=
 dipping in holy water). John the Baptist says, "I indeed baptize you with =
water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I =E2=
=80=93 He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire." (MATTHEW 3:11). =
Purification with fire is superior to purification with water. Note that fi=
re is clubbed with Holy Spirit here. In Veda also, fire is used as a symbol=
 of Self. 
Many seekers in=C2=A0 many religions achieved the ascension of i=
ndividual consciousness into cosmic consciousness using the medium of fire.=
 With advancing Kali yuga, knowledge has given way to ignorance in many rel=
igions and now finally in Hinduism too! However, a Satya yuga like sub-peri=
od within Kali yuga is coming again. 
BTW, the under construction website h=
ttp://FireYoga.nethas some more information along these lines.

I agree to 99 percent of this email, except the quote from John about bapti=
