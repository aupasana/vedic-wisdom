Namaste Girish,
 
I am not at all against knowing the meaning, so that one =
can immerse oneself in what one is chanting. That is definitely the ideal s=
ituation.
 
If that is not possible, what I am saying is that reading somet=
hing composed by an elevated being even without understanding the meaning i=
s very useful. Suppose someone does not understand what Ganapathi Atharvase=
ersham means, thinks in general that it extols Ganapathi as the source of e=
verything and chants it with a sense of surrender to Ganapathi. One can sti=
ll benefit immensely. If one is not experiencing anything, it is more likel=
y because one does not have the correct attitude and surrender and probably=
 not because one does know the specific meaning of Ganapathi Atharvaseersha=
m. Many people knowing the meaning and chanting may also experience nothing=
.
 
The words uttered by a realized soul have meanings at many layers and l=
iteral meaning is only one superficial layer. Some important layers are los=
t in translation. The most important layers of meaning are never understood=
 intellectually, but only experienced internally.
 
Whether you know the me=
aning or not, chant the mantra with a calm and relaxed mind and with devoti=
on and surrender. Many people keep a target count and race through it or do=
 it mechanically with a sense of duty. If it is done even with a little bit=
 of love and surrender to the deity, it can do something. The key to succes=
s with a mantra is calmness of the mind. If a mind is filled with thousands=
 of thoughts and chanting of the mantra is just one of those thousand activ=
ities, nothing will happen. If most thoughts subside and mind is essentiall=
y reverberating with a mantra, that is when one experiences a mantra.
 
The=
re are 4 levels of sabda. When one says a mantra, physical vibration is acc=
ompanied in other layers by the imagery in the mind, the thoughts and insti=
ncts in the conscious and sub-conscious mind etc. Some mantras composed by =
(or revealed to) great rishis/yogis (essentially beings with very stable an=
d calm minds) are designed such that the physical vibration of the mantra c=
an eventually cause the corresponding imagery in the mind by resonance, whe=
n other mental activity subsides. Thus, after repeating the mantra and calm=
ing the mind down, you can recreate a certain imagery and thought system in=
 your mind. That can permanently alter the way your mind workd. But the key=
 is to attain a reasonably stable, focused and calm mind.
 
Sant Dnyaneshwa=
r's Marathi interpretation of BhagavadGita and Sant Tulsidas's Hindi compos=
itions have a power of their own, as they were realized souls. In compariso=
n, for examplle, Satyadevaashtakam composed by me, though in metrical Sansk=
rit, will not have a similar power.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

ash, the author of the write-up posted here. Since the last 4-5 years I hav=
e preferred to stay away from internet forums due to various reasons. It ha=
s been nearly a year since I interacted on an internet forum. However after=
 Narasimha garu forwarded a copy of the original post with my write up to m=

happy to note that the general atmosphere here is far better and more since=
re than a lot of other forums. Having quickly browsed through this particul=
ar thread, I thought that I might reply to Utpal ji's question.

needs to be invoked in order to understand the ONE question and the MANY an=

y speaking if the question is whether initiation is an absolute requirement=
 for spiritual life or sadhana, *my* answer is- NO. However if the question=
 is about the necessity of being initiated for mantra sadhana as enjoined b=

cessity of a Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the practicalization of c=
ertain occult truths via the energetics of Sabda through the employment of =
Vak. It presupposes certain dangers inherent to any lab experiment and ther=
eby certain regulations and safe practices. It should be remembered that ex=
cept Bhakti marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at various levels, while B=
hakti predominantly invokes Soma (the reference here is to the age-old `Agn=

river within the Tantric context. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sa=

 Sri Vidya  sadhana belongs to Srikula. Just to make the picture more compl=

 who are familiar with Tibetan Buddhism I will draw attention to the the 21=

ali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma is not invoked at all)=
 while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, at least at the major milestone=
s in the internal spiritual journey. The yantra, mantra, bija, devata, etc =
are all consistently of a particular set of synchronistic frequencies for e=
ach of these three lineages. Initiation is the full-fledged entry of the pr=
actitioner into a particular spiritual lineage of that path (kula). The Gur=
u parampara can be compared to an INVERTED TREE with SIVA himself at the ro=
ot from where the trunk arises. Each branch and sub-branches and twigs spre=

but also prevents short circuit. Imagine many beautiful

each point in this inverted tree of live wires, where there is a long serie=
s of sadhakas sitting in silent practice all the way up till Siva himself. =
 It is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) and Sound (Sabda). Now back to Sr=

antras and rituals are used for two purposes - (i) for getting specific mat=

the case of (i), there are pitfalls and a guru can prepare one sufficiently=

as I said several times, there are very few people who can do (i) now-a-day=

4) Gentle deities give good results slowly, but there are fewer hiccups. Fi=
erce deities give results fast, but there may be some hiccups. I gave this =
analogy earlier also. Imagine that a person is taking rotten fruits from a =
fruit basket and throwing them in garbage and trying to retrieve one good f=
ruit from under them. If the person is gentle, one may do it gently and the=
 spillage of rotten fruits on the floor will be minimal. If the person is a=
ggressive, one may do it fast and there may be more spillage of rotten frui=
ts on the floor. But the good fruit stuck under the rotten fruits will be r=
etrieved faster. Similarly, phala of your karmas is in a basket. The deity =
is trying to take bad fruits and throw them in garbage and give you a good =
fruit to eat. There may be some spillage. A gentle deity like Ganapathi, Vi=
shnu or Lakshmi may take more time to get out the good fruit, but the spill=
age will be minimal. A fierce deity like Chandi or

arasimha may have more spillage, but the good fruit comes out faster.

e, you can start mantras without initiation. If some bad results occut, you=
 have to realize that it is a fruit of your own actions and the deity is tr=

deities.
