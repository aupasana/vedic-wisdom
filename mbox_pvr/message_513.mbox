Namaste,
 
I recommend adding Om only. You can chant anytime as the havan i=
s going on.

  Dear Narasimha,

  Thank you for your guidance. I am=
 glad that you hinted about the Navarna Mantra...as per Swami Sivananda's w=
ritings, the Navarna Mantra is "Aim hreem kleem chaamundaayai vichche " 

 =
 http://www.dlshq.org/religions/navaratri.htm

  Yet most people I have met=
 continue to use "OM" before the mantra and still refer it as Navarna Mantr=
a, similar to the Siva Panchaakshari Mantra, "Namah Sivaaya" which people c=
ommonly say is "Om Namah Sivaaya". The "OM" at the beginning of the mantra =
is supposedly added to "protect" us. Could you please share your thoughts o=
n this topic.

  Tommorrow evening, we have the Ashtami Chandi Havan and I =
would like to start reciting the mantra. Is it preferable to start the mant=
ra during the Havan itself OR do I need to wait till the purnaahuti of the =
Havan and then start the mantra chanting at the Havan Kund?

  warm regards=
,
  Chandraprakash

  Namaste,

  There are 11 days instead of =
10 from Pratipada to Vijaya Dasami this time. If you look at the nights bef=
ore Vijaya Dasami, then there are ten nights instead of nine this year. Thi=
s happens sometimes.

  If you live on US east coast, then Chaturthi comes =
twices on Thursday and Friday (Oct 2 & 3). It lasted the entire Thursday an=
d extended into Friday. Panchami was on Saturday (Oct 4). Shashthi was on S=
unday (Oct 5). Ashtami is on Tuesday (Oct 8). Navami is on Wednesday (Oct 9=
). Dasami is on Thursday (Oct 10).

  If one's parents did not do a proper =
"anna praasana" ritual (the ritual of first feeding of solid food to a baby=
) to one, should one consider oneself not entitled to eat any solid food? N=
ot doing a mantra because of no initiation is basically like that.

  Getti=
ng initiation is good, especially if the one initiating has some level of s=
adhana in that mantra. But it is neither necessary nor sufficient for makin=
g progress in your own sadhana.

  If you see my homam document, I gave an =
analogy for this. A millionaire may open a bank account in his son's name w=
ith a starting balance of a million dollars. This is akin to a good guru in=
itiating a sishya in a mantra. Sishya starts off by getting some of guru's =
attainment. But the son may waste those million dollars and end up with not=
hing. Similarly the sishya may fall and not achieve anything. Another perso=
n may not have anyone to give money and may start off with a zero bank bala=
nce but accumulate millions of dollars with own effort. This is akin to a p=
erson doing sadhana with a mantra without guru and attaining some level in =
the mantra.

  Some people hold the view that mantras cannot be chanted wit=
hout a proper "initiation" . This view is especially prevalent in some sect=
ions of society w.r.t. navarna mantra. However, I disagree with that view.
=

  If you know the mantra (!), just chant it. What would an initiating guru=
 have done for you? Perhaps he would've given some of his attainment in the=
 mantra to you. Well, you can do it yourself if you work hard. Or a guru wo=
uld've taught you the right nyasas to be done before the mantra. Well, you =
can get the nyasas from books too. Moreover, what most people do today for =
nyasas is anyway just a ritual with no meaning. Nyasa literally means place=
ment. You place various sounds in various body parts (like the tips of vari=
ous fingers, heart, top of head, eyes etc). People merely act out some sign=
als while saying the sounds. This "placement" is actually supposed to be an=
 internal act and it creates an ideal environment for the repetition of man=
tra. Due to the external actions, what is supposed to occur internally does=
 not occur in most. So the sounds end up not getting properly placed in the=
 body. In other words, what I am trying to say is that most people do not k=
now how to "place" various "sounds" in various body parts. They merely perf=
orm meaningless ritualistic actions. So, if you do not know nyasas, you are=
 not really missing much compared to others who were initiated.

  In my hu=
mble opinion, the most important qualification is to have devotion and sens=
e of surrender to Her. If you have them, you can consider yourself "highly =
initiated".

  Best regards,
  Narasimha

    Dear Narasimha,

    When does Navratr=
i end? It started on last Monday, September 29, 2008 and should therefore e=
nd on Tuesday, October 7, 2008 (Nine Nights)...yet the panchang shows that =
at sunrise on Wednesday, October 8 starts with Navami, so should we continu=
e our Navratri on Wednesday too even though it is technically the 10th day?=
 (All these times are based on US EST)..

    Also, can anyone do the Navar=
na mantra, "Om Aim Hrim Klim Chamundayai Vicche" or does this require initi=
ation?

    Thanks,
    Chandraprakash
