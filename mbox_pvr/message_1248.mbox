Namaste friends,
 
Along the lines of other short homam manuals that are av=
ailable on the homam website below, a short Shiva homam manual is available=
 now. This homam is simple and short enough to be performed daily or weekly=
 or monthly.
 
It has many options for the main mantra used. Instead of doi=
ng a little of each mantra and covering many mantras, I suggest picking any=
 ONE mantra and doing it as many times as one can. If one is unable to choo=
se a mantra, I suggest Mrityunjaya mantra. If one wants a simpler mantra, I=
 suggest "Om hreem namashshivaaya". However, there are many options in the =
manual.
 
My advance greetings for a happy Maha Shivaratri!
 
It is hoped t=
hat spiritual seekers take advantage of this manual.
 
Company of fire has =
a highly beneficial effect on mind and homam (fire ritual) is far more effe=
ctive than japam (meditation) in purifying mind and removing obstacles. Alm=
ost all the remedial measures (upayas) taught by Maharshi Parasara in Briha=
t Parasara Hora Sastram (BPHS) involve homam and not japam. As the internal=
 purifying fire within individuals becomes weaker with deepening Kali yuga,=
 value of external fire in meditation increases. Meditation without an exte=
rnal fire is much slower and less efficient for most people.
 
Homam manual=
s for Mahaganapathi, Chandi, Krishna, Mahalakshmi, Saturn and Mars are alre=
ady there on the website. We will slowly add manuals for more deities.
 
Be=
st regards,
Narasimha
