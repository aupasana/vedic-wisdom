Namaste,

l.

Both are correct, =
but at different levels. I will elaborate. However, this is philosophically=
 complex and those who do not follow what I say should not worry at all.

*=
        *        *

Non-dual self has no division of self into various obje=
cts or space or time. There is no concept of time or space or space-time co=
ntinuum within non-dual self. A yogi absorbed in non-dual self has no sense=
 of space or time or objectification.

Supreme cosmic being is the link bet=
ween duality and non-duality. Supreme cosmic being arising in this non-dual=
 self captures the entire field of duality within Him. All beings, entire s=
pace and all space-time continua within the field of duality exist within H=
im. From the perspective of supreme cosmic being, all beings of the dual wo=
rld are His parts and all their individual wills are parts of His cosmic wi=
ll. As all space-time continua are within Him, there is nothing that is unk=
nown to Him. Past, present and future; here, there and everywhere; I, you a=
nd others, this possibility, that possibility and yet another possibility -=
 all are accessible and fully "known" to His self-awareness.

Now, let us c=
ome lower and into the field of duality. The field of duality consists of i=
nfinite divisions of space, time and space-time continua. There are infinit=
e possibilities within this field.

Normally, people stuck deeply within du=
ality have a linear sense of time and perceive just a part of one space-tim=
e continuum. However, field of duality also contains planes of consciousnes=
s where different senses of time and different space-time continua (that ma=
y intersect at various points) exist. A yogi who experiences such a space-t=
ime continuum in such a plane of consciousness may experience a point of ti=
me that maps to a future time in a regular space-time continuum being exper=
ienced by you. Also, what is 1 minute in one space-time continuum may be 1 =
year in another space-time continuum. Time is not as straight-forward an en=
tity as one may think. Basically, the field of duality contains infinite sp=
ace-time continua and what one experiences depends on the plane of consciou=
sness that one's self-awareness (Kundalini) is in. But, most of us experien=
ce part of a specific space-time continuum and hence think that that is the=
 only reality. But relaity consists of infinite space-time continua that in=
tersect each other. These are all different possibilities and you chart out=
 your course based on your actions and Nature's reactions to your actions.
=

*        *        *

>From the perspective of a yogi who is in a different =
space-time continuum, your state may be known at a time that is in "future"=
 as per the space-time continuum in which you exist. But, from the perspect=
ive of the space-time continuum that you are in, your state at that future =
time is not yet known and depends on your current action.

If a yogi in a d=
ifferent space-time continuum has seen your state in future, his observatio=
n is merely an observation and from his reference frame. It has no causal r=
elationship to your current action or your future state. He is merely an ob=
server and he does not cause anything to happen. His observation is specifi=
c to some space-time pairs and does not cover all the space-time pairs that=
 you will traverse as you travel to reach the space-time pair where he obse=
rved you (if at all you do!).

*        *        *

Let us go further. Is t=
here only one future possible for you? Or, does the path traversed by you i=
n space-time continuum not fixed but variable based on your actions? Can yo=
ur actions at important cross-roads alter the course you traverse?

If so, =
what is the meaning of a yogi observing you at a space-time pair? Is his ob=
servation only a possibility or a certainty? One may say "how can one obser=
ve a possibility? Anything we observe must be a certainty." But is that cor=
rect? Aren't the field of duality and the infinite space-time continua cont=
ained in it merely a set of infinite possibilities?

Some great rishis can =
see not just a space-time pair, but many space-time continua at the same ti=
me, i.e. they can see various possibilities based on various possible actio=
ns. However, visions seen by most yogis about "future" are just one possibi=
lity.

*        *        *

Bottomline: At the level at which we exist, the=
re is certainly something called "freewill". Within the limits imposed by t=
he reactions given by nature to your own previous actions, you do have a sc=
ope for engaging in different actions at this time. Depending on which acti=
on you engage in, the future can be slightly different. Some actions can ev=
en make the future significantly different. A rishi may be able to chart ou=
t a significant portion of the field of possibilities for future (e.g. like=
 a brilliant chess player figuring out most possibilities upto 20 moves fro=
m now). An advanced yogi may be able to see a few possibilities for future =
(e.g. like a good chess player figuring out a few moves or guessing a futur=
e position). But the supreme cosmic being knows the entire field of possibi=
lities, as they all exist within Him.

However, your actions are what bring=
 to fruition (w.r.t. the reference frame of your consciousness!) some of th=
ose possibilities. One may know all the possibilities quite deeply and even=
 guess the possibility that will come to fruition, but it is your actions t=
hat actually make some of those possibilities a reality.

        Namaste Narasimhaji

        No doubt a wonderfu=
l and inspiring mail for all of us, however, I could not help it that an in=
evitable question popped up in my mind. One of the oft discussed and eterna=
l questions.

        If events have already been created like in a movie a=
nd later as time unfolds, they happen in our plane of existence, then all t=
alk of freewill must be humbug? Like a placebo that makes us "happy" but in=
 reality does not exist!

        I am not questioning that what you wrote =
in the mail about events having already happened, because same has been sai=
d by other great spiritual people in the world. 

        But my question i=
s because I cannot reconcile this with a freewill. Both cannot be correct. =
It is either this or that.

        Theoritically speaking, say tomorrow su=
ddenly majority of the world reforms itself, does a self correction exercis=
e and brings in peace, harmony etc etc, then why should the Kalki Avatar st=
ill incarnate? But then if the Kalki Avatar has to incarnate - as our texts=
 say - then such a self correcting option is already negated out.

        =
Well, theoritically, in a very large viewpoint no one has any choice in the=
 sense that finally everyone will end up merging with the divine.

        =
So I guess freewill is not really as free as we love to think.

          Namaste,

          I mentioned an e=
pisode of a small boy who did a very short Chandi homam and saw Vishnu's te=
n incarnations above the fire in the following mail:

          http://grou=
ps. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 761

          This boy was bor=
n and brought up in US and is not proficient in his knowledge of Hinduism. =
He did not know much about some of the ten incarnations. He described what =
he saw and I told him who was who and a little about them. One of the forms=
 he saw was a radiant man with white clothes riding a white horse on a dust=
y road. I told him he was Kalki and he hadn't come yet.

          * * *

 =
         This boy is usually playful, easy-going and smiling. But, when I w=
as with him one morning, I saw him lost in some serious thought. This was a=
bou a week after the episode mentioned in the above mail.

          I aske=
d what he was thinking. He said, "it is not that the future that is to come=
 has not already happened. It has already happened in reality, but it will =
happen later when the time comes. You know what I mean?" I guessed what he =
was getting at, but pretended not to know. I said, "no. What do you mean?"
=

          He said, "I don't know how to say what I am thinking." This boy =
is not known to be overly intelligent or articulate. His main characteristi=
c is that he is usually cheerful, playful, sweet, kind, contented and relax=
ed. However, he was onto something today. But he could not express himself.=


          I helped him, "do you mean to say that future has already happe=
ned at some level, but will reveal itself to people later? Kind of like a m=
ovie. A movie may have been shot and become ready in a studio. Some people =
may have already seen it. But people seeing it on the screen later will thi=
nk it is happening in front of them. Are you saying something like that?"

=
          He exclaimed, "exactly. That is what I am saying. If something is=
 going to happen in future, it will happen when future comes. But somebody =
may be able to see it before future comes, because it has already happened.=
"

          Though he did not mention it, I knew why he was thinking along=
 these lines. When I told him the man riding the horse in his vision over t=
he fire was Kalki and he was yet to come, he was probably confused. Given h=
is age and ability to think and understand things, this probably seemed lik=
e an oddity to him that he should see somebody who had not yet come. So he =
was trying to think how it was possible and came to some important conclusi=
ons about "time" in his own way.

          Time seems linear at the level =
of regular consciousness. However, in many planes of conssciousness, the co=
ncept of time becomes changed. It even loses its meaning when one is establ=
ished in non-dual Aatman or Brahman or Self.

          * * *

          Th=
e same boy once performed a very short Kaali homam with a small naama mantr=
a of Dakshina Kaali with beejaakshara added before name. When we were medit=
ating after poornaahuti, I felt a very intense and powerful energy. It was =
quite different from the energy I feel normally. This intense energy made m=
y mind feel satisfied and blissful and a feeling that can be loosely expres=
sed in words as "I am done here. I have nothing more left to do. Time to le=
ave" filled my entire consciousnss.

          I had experienced the same k=
ind of intense energy twice before that. Once I experienced the same energy=
 when I was meditating sitting next to my guru Manish who was doing a Chand=
i homam in India. Second time was when I had an unexpected opportunity to m=
editate inside the garbhaalaya of a famous temple, standing within 3 feet f=
rom the main Kaali idol there, which was sanctified and worshipped by a gre=
at saint in the past. The energy I felt was the same on all the three occas=
ions. At no other time did I feel that intense shakti.

          Interesti=
ngly, after we finished meditation and opened eyes, that boy remarked, "out=
 of all the different homas I did so far, this is the bestest homam." I ask=
ed him why. He said, "I don't know how to say it, but it just felt awesome =
and different."

          * * *

          This boy performed a really sim=
ple and short procedure, shorter than what I give in manuals. But it seemed=
 like he was successful in making a powerful energy manifest there. The bot=
tomline is that internal purity is the most important thing.

          Rit=
uals help purify one and purity helps one do a ritual better and get more o=
ut of it. It is an egg and chicken problem and one has to keep doing it unt=
il one breaks through.

          Keep performing your chosen spiritual pra=
ctices, but do pay attention to internal purity as you engage in external p=
ractices. The only worthwhile measure of spiritual progress and purity is h=
ow smaller your ego becomes. As ego becomes smaller, you can resist attract=
ion to external things better and you can resist internal enemies like lust=
, anger, jealosy etc better. You can do your dharma better. Ego - thinking =
that this is "I" and this is "mine" - is the root cause of all problems.

 =
         * * *

          Overcoming ego using jnaana yoga is relatively ch=
allenging, but bhakti yoga is easier. Think that all that is around you - i=
ncluding your house, money, cars, spouse, children and your own body - is g=
od's property and that you are a temporary caretaker of all of these proper=
ties of god. Do the best job you can, but without entertaining the notion "=
this is mine". A faithful servant takes very good care of his master's prop=
erties, but without thinking of all those things as his or her belongings.
=

          Realize that thinking of things as "mine" is not necessary for t=
aking good care of them. A servant who loves one's master takes the best ca=
re of things entrusted to one. When a thing is taken away, a servant does n=
ot waste time worrying and crying. A servant will accept that is master's p=
roperty and can be taken away anytime. This enables one to do the best job =
with what one possesses and not worry about what one does not possess or wh=
at is out of one's control.

          Developing the attitude of a servant=
 who takes care of master's properties will help one wade the ocean of worl=
dly life without getting caught and overcome ego.

          Best regards,

        <DIV>No doubt a wonderful and inspiring mail f=
or all of us, however, I 
        could not help it that an inevitable ques=
tion popped up in my mind. One 
        of the oft discussed and eternal qu=
estions.</DIV>
        <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>=

        <DIV>If events have already been created like in a movie and later=
 as 
        time unfolds, they happen in our plane of existence, then all =
talk of 
        freewill must be humbug? Like a placebo that makes us "hap=
py" but in 
        reality does not exist!</DIV>
        <DIV><FONT face=
=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
        <DIV>I am not questioning tha=
t what you wrote in the mail about events 
        having already happened,=
 because same has been said by other great 
        spiritual people in the=
 world. </DIV>
        <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>=

        <DIV>But my question is because I cannot reconcile this with a fre=
ewill. 
        Both cannot be correct. It is either this or that.</DIV>
  =
      <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
        <DIV>The=
oritically speaking, say tomorrow suddenly majority of the world 
        r=
eforms itself, does a self correction exercise and brings in peace, 
      =
  harmony etc etc, then why should the Kalki Avatar still incarnate? But 
 =
       then if the Kalki Avatar has to incarnate - as our texts say - then =
such 
        a self correcting option is already negated out.</DIV>
      =
  <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
        <DIV>Well, t=
heoritically, in a very large viewpoint no one has any

he sense that finally everyone will end up merging with the

        <DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>

    <DIV>Namaste,<BR><BR>I mentioned an episode of a small boy who did a

         very short Chandi homam and saw Vishnu's ten incarnations above th=
e 
          fire in the following mail:<BR><BR><A

message/ 761</A><BR><BR>This boy was born and brought up in US 
          a=
nd is not proficient in his knowledge of Hinduism. He did not know 
       =
   much about some of the ten incarnations. He described what he saw and 
 =
         I told him who was who and a little about them. One of the forms h=
e 
          saw was a radiant man with white clothes riding a white horse =
on a 
          dusty road. I told him he was Kalki and he hadn't come yet.=
<BR><BR>* * 
          *<BR><BR>This boy is usually playful, easy-going and=
 smiling. But, 
          when I was with him one morning, I saw him lost i=
n some serious 
          thought. This was abou a week after the episode m=
entioned in the above 
          mail.<BR><BR>I asked what he was thinking.=
 He said, "it is not that 
          the future that is to come has not alr=
eady happened. It has already 
          happened in reality, but it will h=
appen later when the time comes. You 
          know what I mean?" I guesse=
d what he was getting at, but pretended not 
          to know. I said, "no=
. What do you mean?"<BR><BR>He said, "I don't know 
          how to say wh=
at I am thinking." This boy is not known to be overly 
          intelligen=
t or articulate. His main characteristic is that he is 
          usually c=
heerful, playful, sweet, kind, contented and relaxed. 
          However, h=
e was onto something today. But he could not express 
          himself.<BR=
><BR>I helped him, "do you mean to say that future has 
          already h=
appened at some level, but will reveal itself to people 
          later? K=
ind of like a movie. A movie may have been shot and become 
          ready=
 in a studio. Some people may have already seen it. But people 
          s=
eeing it on the screen later will think it is happening in front of 
      =
    them. Are you saying something like that?"<BR><BR>He exclaimed, 
      =
    "exactly. That is what I am saying. If something is going to happen in =

          future, it will happen when future comes. But somebody may be ab=
le to 
          see it before future comes, because it has already 
      =
    happened."<BR><BR>Though he did not mention it, I knew why he was 
    =
      thinking along these lines. When I told him the man riding the horse =

          in his vision over the fire was Kalki and he was yet to come, he=
 was 
          probably confused. Given his age and ability to think and u=
nderstand 
          things, this probably seemed like an oddity to him tha=
t he should see 
          somebody who had not yet come. So he was trying =
to think how it was 
          possible and came to some important conclusi=
ons about "time" in his 
          own way.<BR><BR>Time seems linear at the=
 level of regular 
          consciousness. However, in many planes of cons=
sciousness, the concept 
          of time becomes changed. It even loses i=
ts meaning when one is 
          established in non-dual Aatman or Brahman=
 or Self.<BR><BR>* * 
          *<BR><BR>The same boy once performed a very=
 short Kaali homam with a 
          small naama mantra of Dakshina Kaali w=
ith beejaakshara added before 
          name. When we were meditating afte=
r poornaahuti, I felt a very intense 
          and powerful energy. It was=
 quite different from the energy I feel 
          normally. This intense e=
nergy made my mind feel satisfied and blissful 
          and a feeling tha=
t can be loosely expressed in words as "I am done 
          here. I have n=
othing more left to do. Time to leave" filled my entire 
          consciou=
snss.<BR><BR>I had experienced the same kind of intense energy 
          t=
wice before that. Once I experienced the same energy when I was 
          =
meditating sitting next to my guru Manish who was doing a Chandi homam 
   =
       in India. Second time was when I had an unexpected opportunity to 
 =
         meditate inside the garbhaalaya of a famous temple, standing withi=
n 3 
          feet from the main Kaali idol there, which was sanctified an=
d 
          worshipped by a great saint in the past. The energy I felt was=
 the 
          same on all the three occasions. At no other time did I fee=
l that 
          intense shakti.<BR><BR>Interestingly, after we finished m=
editation and 
          opened eyes, that boy remarked, "out of all the di=
fferent homas I did 
          so far, this is the bestest homam." I asked =
him why. He said, "I don't 
          know how to say it, but it just felt =
awesome and different."<BR><BR>* 
          * *<BR><BR>This boy performed a=
 really simple and short procedure, 
          shorter than what I give in =
manuals. But it seemed like he was 
          successful in making a powerf=
ul energy manifest there. The bottomline 
          is that internal purity=
 is the most important thing.<BR><BR>Rituals 
          help purify one and=
 purity helps one do a ritual better and get more 
          out of it. It =
is an egg and chicken problem and one has to keep doing 
          it until=
 one breaks through.<BR><BR>Keep performing your chosen 
          spiritua=
l practices, but do pay attention to internal purity as you 
          enga=
ge in external practices. The only worthwhile measure of spiritual 
       =
   progress and purity is how smaller your ego becomes. As ego becomes 
   =
       smaller, you can resist attraction to external things better and you=
 
          can resist internal enemies like lust, anger, jealosy etc bette=
r. You 
          can do your dharma better. Ego - thinking that this is "I=
" and this is 
          "mine" - is the root cause of all problems.<BR><BR=
>* * 
          *<BR><BR>Overcoming ego using jnaana yoga is relatively cha=
llenging, 
          but bhakti yoga is easier. Think that all that is arou=
nd you - 
          including your house, money, cars, spouse, children and=
 your own body 
          - is god's property and that you are a temporary =
caretaker of all of 
          these properties of god. Do the best job you=
 can, but without 
          entertaining the notion "this is mine". A fait=
hful servant takes very 
          good care of his master's properties, bu=
t without thinking of all 
          those things as his or her belongings.=
<BR><BR>Realize that thinking of 
          things as "mine" is not necessa=
ry for taking good care of them. A 
          servant who loves one's maste=
r takes the best care of things entrusted 
          to one. When a thing i=
s taken away, a servant does not waste time 
          worrying and crying.=
 A servant will accept that is master's property 
          and can be take=
n away anytime. This enables one to do the best job 
          with what on=
e possesses and not worry about what one does not possess 
          or wha=
t is out of one's control.<BR><BR>Developing the attitude of a 
          s=
ervant who takes care of master's properties will help one wade the 
      =
    ocean of worldly life without getting caught and overcome
