Namaste Pratima ji,
 
Everything in the world is based on give and take. You give something (good or bad) and you are given something comparable back.
 
Each aahuti or offering made to a deity in homam will bring something back to you. The desires and thoughts in your mind when making an offering have a subtle imprint on the offering and that has a bearing on what you get back from the deity. However, as I said earlier, the age of perfectly controlling and getting specific results from rituals is almost gone. We are like beggars who beg god for this and that. Just as a beggar begging for cashews may not be given cashews and may have to adjust with rice, one wanting a result may get a different result.
 
With each offering in fire, it is like you are begging god to give something. If a specific desire is subtly imprinted on the offering, then it is like you are begging god to give that specific result. Of course, god may or may not give that exactly.
 
Poornaahuti is an important part of homam and do not skip it. It is like you are standing helpless and bowing completely to god and begging one final time. You may want spiritual progress or you may want marriage or child or promotion in job or whatever. God will decide what to give, but it does not hurt to ask for what you want.
 
*        *        *
 
Thus, it is ok to do homam even if you have material desires and consider yourself unready for spiritual progress. Only remember two things: (1) you can ask what you want, but god decides what to give, (2) the more the attitude of a helpless beggar you have (as opposed to thinking "I have a done a nice homam. God will not have to give me so and so thing"), the better it is.
 
*        *        *

Ganapathi homam and Vishnu sahasra naama homam are good if one has material desires. If you pray to a fierce deity (e.g. Chandi), that deity CAN also give you material success, but there is a chance that that deity will take away material success in order to give fast spiritual progress. With soumya devatas (gentle deities) such as Vishnu, spiritual progress can become slower and material results can be fulfilled.
 
*        *        *
 
Secondly, do not be afraid of spiritual progress. Many people have wrong notions. In people's minds, spiritual progress is linked with leaving the material world. That is not true.
 
Sanatana dharma is not based on physical renunciation. Grihastha dharma and sannyaasa dharma are equally respected in Sanatana dharma. Though some become sannyasis (renunciates), most people marry. In fact, even many sannyasis marry first and later renounce. In many modern religions, physical renunciation seems to be over-stressed. While Hindu priests guiding people in spiritual pursuits may marry and have wife and children, priests in some religions are forced to remain bachelors.
 
With the influence of these religions on sanatana dharma in recent millennia, spiritual progress and attainment came to be associated with physical renunciation. However, please note that physical renunciation is neither a necessary condition nor a sufficient condition for mental renunciation and liberation. One living in a forest may not have overcome all desires and one living in a big palace with a beautiful wife may have overcome all desires. Desires are in the mind. Liberation is in the mind.
 
The goal of spiritual sadhana is not to leave everything and go to a forest. The goal of sadhana is to be free irrespective of where one is and what one is doing. Liberation is possible while remaining in the material world and with wife and children.
 
A liberated person does not necessarily leave action and go to a forest. After he was liberated, king Janaka ruled Mithila and lived in a palace. After Arjuna became liberated, he killed many including his gurus and elders. A liberated person does what is the right action for him/her and more efficiently than you and me, because his/her mind is not thinking about useless things. Attachment to results does not make our actions better, but it clouds our judgment, distracts our mental focus and makes our actions inefficient. A liberated person is unattached to the result, but performs very efficient actions.
 
Spiritual progress enables one to be more productive and efficient. It is not something to fear.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

Unlike you all who are determined to give yourselves to the Lord I am not ready for extreme level of spirituality.I like praying god but don't want to commit saying that I don't want any riches,any happiness etc.

I want to call god in fire pray, meditate keep it simple. As fire is the most auspicious form I am tempted to pray God in that medium. So can I skip the purnahuti section. Do I need to make any changes in sankalpam?
