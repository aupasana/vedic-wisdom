Namaste cuteyashica ji,
=C2=A0
When there is fire, there will be some smoke=
. Tough to avoid..
=C2=A0
However, if you are getting a lot of smoke contin=
uously after fire goes off, it means there is some material that could not =
burn well. One possibility is that a portion of poornahuti at the bottom (o=
r some previously offered material covered by poornahuti) could not burn we=
ll. In general, smoke is a sign that fire tried to reach/consume some parts=
 but was unable to.
=C2=A0
When offering things, offer things small enough =
(depending on the size of fire) so that they burn fully.
=C2=A0
Secondly, t=
hings offered should have enough air circulation. Even if I offer small ite=
ms, things stuck in the middle of a big pile do not get enough oxygen to bu=
rn. Offering materials at a reasonable pace and spreading them throughout t=
he firepit, may help.

=C2=A0
Even firewood logs will burn better and brigh=
ter if they have air circulation. If a wood log touches fire pit bottom/wal=
ls only at its two edges and is suspended in air elsewhere, it will burn be=
tter because of air supply. Otherwise, edges of the portion without air cir=
culation may keep releasing smoke.

=C2=A0
As things burn, if you turn them=
 around or mix them up so that everything burns well (tongs may be used), i=
t can help you burn everything well.
=C2=A0When I offer poornahuti (a whole=
 dry coconut) in my homam, I pre-arrange burnt wood coals in a structure th=
at has nice air flow. When coconut is placed atop those coals, it does not =
crush everything (in which case, some stuff under coconut or bottom of coco=
nut may burn fully by the time fire goes off), but gets suspended on the co=
als with most of the coconut getting air circulation. It burns nicely from =
all sides, including the bottom. If this is not possible, you may want to t=
urn the poornahuti around in the middle (while there is still fire) and per=
haps change its position/place (and offer a little more ghee then). In my c=
ase, I go into one-hour japam after poornahuti and do not want to stop medi=
tation in the middle to take care of poornahuti. So I arrange things nicely=
 beforehand. The way it is placed, it just burns completely and everything =
offered before also burns completely, by the time fire goes off by itself.
=
=C2=A0
It is a matter of understanding the dynamics of how fire and oxygen =
interact to burn materials and when smoke comes. One should try to learn fr=
om experience and draw common sense lessons.

Regarding shreema.org recommendation ("We extinguish the fire during the Pu=
rnahuti. Pour milk over the burning coals", "Milk stands for the ocean of c=
onsciousness =E2=80=93 pure, white, the absence of all colors, attitudes. A=
fter the fire has purified all impurities, it 
is extinguished with pure co=
nsciousness."):
=C2=A0
Such a practice may exist in some traditions. In my =
humble, but firm, opinion, this practice is based on ignorance and worth ig=
noring. When discussing this specific recommendation and the quotes above, =
Dr Svoboda wrote to me, "I definitely do not endorse quenching homa at its =
end. Neither did Vimalananda".
=C2=A0
I believe Shree Ma and Swamiji have t=
heir hearts in the right place and doing good dharmik work. I do admire the=
ir work and wish them well. But this advice of theirs is simply nonsensical=
. First of all, milk is not a symbol of pure consciousness. Milk has a spec=
ific taste and color (sweetness and white) and not really a symbol of guna-=
less pure consciousness. Secondly, fire is the symbol of Divinity and you s=
hould let it process your offerings completely and give the results in due =
time.You can't try to force things. Pouring milk under the pretext that it =
is "pure consciousness" is akin to doing some sadhana and pretending that y=
ou are now in samadhi. That only results in delusions and theatrics and not=
 real samadhi. If you want real samadhi, you need true surrender. True surr=
ender requires infinite patience.
=C2=A0
Never ever extinguish homam fire. =
If there are practical limitations on when fire should go off (e.g. you nee=
d to leave), maintain a small enough fire and offer poornahuti early enough=
, so that fire goes off by itself by the needed time. But you can't forcefu=
lly extinguish it when fire is still burning.

Someone I know does homam outside and leaves for work. Though fire goes off=
 before he leaves, there will be red coals for a much longer time. Wind can=
 make small coals fly off and so, for safety, he covers the homa kundam wit=
h a tightly wrapped aluminum foil. That also is like extinguishing fire bec=
ause you are turning off oxygen supply that can help fire (resident in red =
coals) to burn things further and consume them. If you make 2 small holes i=
n the foil cover to keep oxygen flowing, with holes being small enough that=
 solid things cannot fly off through them, it is safe and, at the same time=
, allows Agni to consume as much as he wants! Once you invite Agni, offer o=
nly as much as you want Him to consume, but do let Him consume all of it. D=
on't stop him forcefully in the middle.

<<Also=
 I am keen in knowing , does attending havan also burn karmas ...I mean not=
 giving any aahuti but just attending havan>>

As per "Parasara Madhaveeyam=
" (commentary on Parasara Smriti - authority for this age - by celebrated M=
adhavacharya, brother of Sayanacharya who wrote the celebrated commentaries=
 on Veda), a ritual performed by oneself is 1,000,000 times more powerful t=
han a ritual performed in one's name by a priest. Then sitting near a ritua=
l performed by someone else is far less effective than doing a ritual by on=
eself. Having said that, it may still be far more effective than most other=
 activities we engage in!!!
=C2=A0
The bottomline, however, is the internal=
 purity and concentration. If one is pure enough and concentrates well, one=
 can offer things to any external fire or even internal fire. If all one ca=
n do is to sit at someone else's homam or pooja, one should go ahead and do=
 it. If all one can do is to meditate where one is, one should go ahead and=
 do it. But, if one has a chance to do a homam, one may consider doing it.
=
=C2=A0
If you don't have a group to chant mantras with but want to, chant a=
lone but imagine that there are other people around you who are chanting. W=
ho knows, oneday you may really be surrounded by many chanting people..

arasara Smriti - authority for this age - by celebrated Madhavacharya, brot=
her of Sayanacharya who wrote the
 celebrated commentaries on Veda), a ritu=
al performed by oneself is 1,000,000 times more powerful than a ritual perf=
ormed in one's name by a priest. Then sitting near a ritual performed by so=
meone else is far less effective than doing a ritual by oneself. Having sai=
d that, it may still be far more effective than most other activities we en=
gage in!!!<br> <br>The bottomline, however, is the internal purity and=
 concentration. If one is pure enough and concentrates well, one can offer =
things to any external fire or even </span><span>internal fire. If all one =
can do is to sit at someone else's homam or pooja, one should go ahead and =
do it. If all one can do is to meditate where one is, one should go ahead a=
nd do it. But, if one has a chance to do a homam, one may consider doing it=

 chant alone but imagine that there are other people around you who are cha=
nting. Who knows, oneday
 you may really be surrounded by many chanting peo=
