For the benefit of those who are not on facebook, I am reproducing somethin=
g interesting.
=C2=A0

>From Arunisha's facebook wall:
=C2=A0
They say our L=
ord was a meek, humble and obedient student of Rishi Sandipani. He never sh=
irked his chores and who inspired his classmates with great love. He had a =
wonderful memory and matchless strength. When his studies were completed, i=
t was time to give his teacher gurudakshina. Divining hidden sorrow in Sand=
ipani, he asked him what he would like. Wistfully, the sage asked if Krishn=
a could possibly trace his son, kidnapped long ago by a sea monster called =
Panchajana. Straightaway, our Lord plumbed the depths of the ocean where he=
 fought and vanquished the beast. Rescuing his guru=E2=80=99s son, he groun=
d the monster=E2=80=99s bones and fashioned a fearful conch, the Paanchajan=
ya=E2=80=94=E2=80=98derived from Panchajana=E2=80=99=E2=80=94 whose sound t=
hereafter struck raw terror in the hearts of evildoers.
=C2=A0
My response:=

=C2=A0
Metaphorically, Krishna represents the dark & mysterious entity of =
a perfected mind. Sandipani means "nice kindling". A perfected mind is all-=
knowing and all-capable and just needs some kindling of spirit to get going=
.
=C2=A0
>From the kindling of spirit comes a charming sense of well-being (=
Madhumangala, son of Sandipani). This charming sense of well-being coming f=
rom the kindling of spirit may be trapped by an attachment to material worl=
d. The demon (tamas) Panchajana (5 beings) represent tamasik attachment to =
5 elements. He lives deep inside the ocean (samsara!).
=C2=A0
Perfected min=
d can rescue this sense of well-being from the clutches of tamasik attachme=
nt to the material world and converts the 5 elements from a tamasik attachm=
ent (demon) to a conch (a call for dharmik action). This world made of panc=
ha mahabhutas is not for enjoyment and attachment, but for engaging in dhar=
mik actions.
=C2=A0
My 2 cents. Sorry if I took away some fun from the beau=
tiful story! :-)
=C2=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha
