  Namaste,

Yes, you can add mantras to Hanuman ji in your homam. Say the m=
antra, 
say "swaahaa" and then "hanumata idaM na mama".

This mantra seems =
like a description of various qualities and deeds of 
Lord Hanuman and shou=
ld be fine to offer. Don't worry about Sakini, 
Dakini etc line. You are pr=
aising Hanuman as the one who destroys them 
and not asking him to do anyth=
ing for you.

Do this mantra with a sense of humility, awe and surrender fo=
r Hanuman. 
Hanuman is the wisest learned person, bravest and strongest war=
rior and 
humblest servant of Lord. Moreover, he is still alive in a *physi=
cal* 
body on earth. If one really surrenders to him, his sadhana can bring=
 
tremendous blessings.

Best regards,
Narasimha
