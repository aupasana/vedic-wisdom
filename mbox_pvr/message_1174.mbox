Namaste friends,
 
You ask a very good question.
 
Agni is the element of t=
ransformation. It symbolizes absorbing and digesting experiences. As you ma=
ke offerings in fire and they burn in fire, various spiritual experiences a=
re processed and digested by your internal fire.
 
Tongue is that which all=
ows one to taste things that one is going to accept inside and digest. Each=
 tongue of fire stands for a spirit that controls how you absorb spiritual =
experiences.
 
*        *        *
 
The seven tongues of Agni are: Kaali, =
Karaali, Manojava, Sulohita, Sudhoomra-Varna, Sphulingini, and Vishwaruchi.=

 
Kaali is the dark and black/blue fire. It symbolizes the spirit of detac=
hment. Spirit of detachment controls how you absorb your experiences, when =
you are offering in that tongue of fire.
 
Karaali is the monstrous, dreadf=
ul fire that looks like a wide open mouth. Spirit of attachment and desire =
controls how you absorb your experiences, when you are offering in that ton=
gue of fire.
 
Manojava is the swiftly moving, flickering and unstable flam=
e. Spirit of wavering (could also be flexibility) controls how you absorb y=
our experiences, when you are offering in that tongue of fire.
 
Sulohita i=
s the (copper like) dark red color flame. Spirit of determination and stren=
gth controls how you absorb your experiences, when you are offering in that=
 tongue of fire.
 
Sudhoomra-Varna is the greyish/purple/smoke-colored fire=
. Spirit of confusion (could also be resolution of confusion) controls how =
you absorb your experiences, when you are offering in that tongue of fire.
=
 
Sphulingini is the fire with sparks. Spirit of aggression and haste (coul=
d also be a great intuition/insight) controls how you absorb your experienc=
es, when you are offering in that tongue of fire.
 
Vishwaruchi is the brig=
ht fire. Spirit of focus, knowing, being and bliss controls how you absorb =
your experiences, when you are offering in that tongue of fire.
 
*        =
*        *
 
As you keep performing homam and a relationship is formed betw=
een you and fire, the external fire in the homa kundam will reflect your in=
ternal fire. When your mind is well-focused and blissful, the fire will aut=
omatically burn bright.
 
The state of your mind will decide how you will t=
aste the spiritual experiences you are going to absorb from around you. Tha=
t in turn decides which tongues (tasting agents) of your internal fire are =
receiving food right now. That in turn decides which tongues of the externa=
l fire are receiving offerings right now.
 
The external fire is a mirror t=
o your internal state. An adept may be able to detect, looking at the fire,=
 which tongues of fire are active right now and hence guess the state your =
mind is in.
 
*        *        *
 
Of course, trying to pay too much atten=
tion to this technicality and becoming over-conscious of the nature of fire=
 is unneeded. Though external can be used to manipulate the internal (withi=
n some limits), it can become a distraction.
 
Whether internal follows ext=
ernal or external follows internal a invalid question. The reality is that =
the two change together. Neither is the cause and neither is the effect. Th=
ey just happen together.
 
Without thinkiing much, just make offerings in t=
he fire with the *firm belief* that god is in fire. The rest will happen au=
tomatically. It may take time, but it will happen by itself.
 
Best regards=
,
Narasimha
