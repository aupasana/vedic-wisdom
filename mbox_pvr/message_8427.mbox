Subject: My 2 Cents on Mahavidyas

Namaste friends,

"Mahavidya" literally means *supreme* knowledge and understanding. 
However, some of the popular notions in contemporary Hinduism do not 
justify why those deities (atleast some!) should be called Mahavidyas.

I want to share my thoughts on what Mahavidyas stand for, based on my 
contemplation of symbols and stories associated with them. Those with a 
better or different understanding may kindly ignore my 2 cents. I am 
certainly not an expert in this area.

*         *         *

All Mahavidyas are different aspects of Shakti at different stages of 
evolution in the *very early* Creation cycle, i.e. when field of duality 
is just about to emanate from non-dual Self. When Shakti is just about 
to separate from Shiva and engage in a Play. Of course, understanding of 
Creation is also the key to Dissolution or Liberation (reverse process)! 
Thus, Mahavidyas represent subtle knowledge related to the creation and 
holding together of the field of duality and are also the keys to 
overcoming it.

I will go through Mahavidyas in the order in which they are found in 
most literature.

*         *         *

Aadyaa (Kaali) represents the state of shakti just after Shiva and 
Shakti separated and the field of duality is just about to spring from 
non-dual Self. This primordial energy is fierce, intense, disorderly and 
uncontrolled and that is seen in a lot of symbols associated with Kaali.

When this primordial energy decides to give rise to the field of duality 
and Creation, it becomes Taaraa. Though very similar to Kaali (one 
Tantra even says, with a bit of hyperbole, that Kaali and Taaraa are the 
same and one distinguishing between them will go to hell!), She has an 
added compassion and Motherly aspect.

When this shakti becomes more orderly and masterfully contemplates the 
masterplan for the way entire duality should operate, it becomes Shodasi 
(Lalita Tripurasundari).

When this shakti plans how various worlds (realms of awareness) operate 
and interact within this duality, it becomes Bhuvaneswari.

When this shakti contemplates how the field of duality to be created 
would recycle itself and keep going continuously (i.e. how objects are 
destroyed and then re-created), it becomes Bhairavi.

When this shakti contemplates how Self would manifest as various objects 
in the field of duality and engage in give and take to make the field of 
duality sustainable and self-sufficient, and, at the same time, make 
each object in the field of duality a microcosm of the *entire* field, 
with that fact concealed by a false identity in each object, it becomes 
Vajra Vairochani (Chhinnamasta).

When this shakti contemplates how to make the objects in the field of 
duality immerse themselves in duality with awareness of underlying 
non-dual Self completely masked off, it becomes Dhoomavati. (Note: So 
she is also the key to reversing it). That's why she is a widow and some 
stories describe her as eating her own Shiva.

When this shakti contemplates how the field of duality would restrain 
beings from escaping it (e.g. various internal enemies and pashas), it 
becomes Valga. With some corruption, the Vedic name Valga (meaning: 
bridle or rein!) became Bagla. Of course, she is the key to 
understanding and overcoming those restraints that keep us tied in 
duality.

When this shakti contemplates how the field of duality would mesmerize 
beings with its variety and keep them trapped in it due to the curiosity 
to understand more of it, it becomes Maatangi.

When this shakti contemplates how to keep the beings happy and fulfilled 
and keep them engaged in the field of duality, it then becomes Kamala.

*         *         *

Thus, ten Mahavidyas reprsent subtle knowledge related to how duality 
comes into being and functions and how beings in duality are kept in 
duality.

The way I have written it, it may sound like there is a hierarchy and 
superiority/inferiority, but that is misleading. Concept in one's mind 
of a house to build, plan of the house on paper, a 3D replica of the 
house and the final house - they have different purposes at different 
stages. To someone, house may be more important than papers. To an 
architect, seeing the house may be useless and plan papers may be more 
important. All the mahavidyas are covering slightly different aspects of 
how duality operates and a perfect understanding of any aspect may take 
one towards liberation. There is a lot of overlap too. In any case, 
depending on one's orientation, one of them may be better. But, overall, 
there is no real hierarchy.

In any case, as I said in previous mails, Mahavidyas are for removing 
the final vestiges of conditioning in the final stages of one's 
spiritual sadhana. The current practice in some circles of prescribing a 
Mahavidya sadhana for routine things such as getting married, getting a 
job, winning a court case etc, are not based on a wise and correct 
understanding.

Best regards,
Narasimha
