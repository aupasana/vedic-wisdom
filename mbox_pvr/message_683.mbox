Namaste Kasim,
 
Yes, I have read Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's achintya-bheda-abh=
eda teachings, just as I have read the dwaita teachings of Madhvacharya, vi=
sishtaadwaita teachings of Ramanujacharya and adwaita teachings of Shankara=
charya. *My* view on those teachings is captured well by Swami Turiyananda,=
 an enlightened sishya of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, in a letter he wrote to =
Swami Sharvananda on 1919 April 18 at Varanasi:
 
"The ultimate Truth is on=
e and nodual. It is called by various names: Brahman, Paramatman, Bhagavan =
[Lord], God, and so on. Whoever has realized that Truth has tried to expres=
s it according to his own temperament and understanding by giving it a part=
icular name. But nobody has been able to express the whole truth. "What he =
is, he is" - that is the final conclusion of those who have realized him.
 =

"From different standpoints, Gaudapada's doctrine of no creation, Shakara'=
s doctrine of superimposition, Ramanuja's doctrine of transformation, and [=
Sri Kantha's] doctrine of Shivadvaita - each one of these is true. Again, a=
part from all these doctrines, he is beyond all human expression and beyond=
 cognition of mind. The founders of all these philosophical systems practis=
ed austerities, and having received God's grace, they preached the various =
doctrines at his command. God is the subject from which these doctrines evo=
lved, but he himself is beyond them."
 
*        *        *
 
The nature of=
 god and this creation are inexpressible in words and can only be experienc=
ed directly. Even one who experienced cannot express accurately, for it is =
inexpressible by definition. I see no point in engaging in arguments on var=
ious doctrines. I firmly believe that Chaitanya, Shankara, Madhva and Raman=
uja were all perfected beings who experienced the highest Truth that is the=
re to experience. Yet, they ended up expressing what they experienced in di=
fferent words. Personally, I think that a discussion on who is more correct=
 is useless, as nobody can accurately capture the nature and relationship b=
etween god and his creation in *words*. One should instead undertake indivi=
dual spiritual sadhana to realize him by direct experience.
 
*        *   =
     *
 
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa used to refer to a statement of Lord Hanum=
an. Hanuman said to Rama, "O Lord, while I identify myself with the body I =
am your servant. When I consider myself as an individual soul, I am a part =
of you. And when I look upon myself as the Atman, I am one with you - this =
is my firm conviction."
 
It is not useful to debate exactly which statemen=
t above is more correct. Most of us cannot relate to anything above. Most o=
f us cannot drop individual self-identification to "look upon self as the A=
tman". Most of us cannot even identify with individual *soul*. Most of us c=
annot rise above the body and mind. Most of us are only able to identify ou=
rselves with a mass of flesh and blood that perishes sooner or later. Most =
of us are only able to identify ourselves with a restless monkey called min=
d that tortures itself in the jaws of six relentless enemies called desire,=
 anger, greed, delusion, wantonness and jealosy, which are all children of =
a monster called ego. Most of us are only able to identify ourselves with a=
 name and an image that give pride oneday and shame another and happiness o=
neday and sadness another.
 
For such people, a comparison of the states ex=
perienced when one self-identifies with different entities is useless. It i=
s like a poor person in India without a passport or a ration card wondering=
 whether to go to US for vacation or to UK or to Italy. It is a theoretical=
 discussion. One should first accumulate some money and get a passport. Sim=
ilarly, one should do spiritual sadhana and reduce ego and refine one's sel=
f-identification.
 
*        *        *
 
I humbly suggest that one should =
follow the teachings of the Teacher one likes. More than what you believe i=
s the final destination of your travel, the immediate steps you take are im=
portant in deciding the success of your spiritual journey.
 
If praise make=
s you happy and criticism makes you sad, if pleasures excite you and pains =
depress you, if beautiful things attract you and ugly things repel you, you=
 have some progress to make in terms of control over mind, irrespective of =
the final destination of your spiritual journey. Whether the final destinat=
ion is Delhi or Agra or Benares, one at Kanya Kumari will have to first sta=
rt walking towards north. Follow your chosen path and purify your conscious=
ness and self-identification. Reduce ego and increase surrender. THAT will =
keep you in good stead.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

  In your spiritual studies have you ever come across the concept of Achint=

  In the non-dual field=

  something that is possible for anyone, but <BR>> there are limits impo=
