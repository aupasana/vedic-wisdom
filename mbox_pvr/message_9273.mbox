Oh GOD
I am very happy to read all these arguments in our forum and I appre=
ciate each and every word of Rajarshi Nandy. Ultimately no one can measure =
Rama or Krishna with one's limited knowledge. Simply follow the Dharma of R=
ama and Krishna and enjoy the bliss. Nothing else.
It was said in one of Ra=
mana Maharshi's short stories that all these avatar stories are/were going =
around time unmemorable. HE says there are four Yugas making one Kalpa and =
there were numerous kalpa passed already. And in every kalpa during these f=
our yugas all those avatars take place. 
What HE tried to say was that all =
these talks are work of mind and the truth lies beyond mind buddhi and ahan=
kar.
So let us try to find the truth through Rama or Krishna or Shiva.
Namo=
 Ramana

Dear Narasimha,
 
Jai Ma!
 
Some freeflowing=
 thoughts that struck me while thinking about some of points you have raise=
d. I am just doing a thinking aloud here. Feel free to disagree :)
 
Firstl=
y, I feel, the conception of colloquially used term Bhagawan as a Superman =
with unlimited potentials way beyond what any normal human being can achiev=
e, came into existence from the Vaishnava schools of Kali Yuga, who looked =
at Krshna as the ultimate God on earth. It is difficult to miss the phoneti=
c similarity between terms Bhagawata and Bhagawana. The Bhagawata religion =
started from the Gita and a contemplation of the life of Krshna. All the ma=
jor purely Vaishnava Acharyas - Ramanujacharya, Madhavacharya, Vallavachary=
a, Nimbarka, Sri Chaitanya as well as the nava-naths (Dhaneshwari was the e=
arliest known non-sanskrit translation of the Gita) - considered, (with dif=
fering nuances on the relation between jiva, paramatma, moksha etc), Krshna=
 as the ultimate conception of God on earth. This was aided in no less a me=
asure by the delcaration of the earliest Puranas, that is Vishnu Purana and=
 the SB, that Krshna was a complete Avatara. Some, like the Gaudiya Vaishna=
vas, went one step ahead and took a very literal view of it all and declare=
d Krshna as the Ultimate Being, and the formless Paramatma, as well as Nara=
yana, as merely the aura of Krshna. Rama was also intricately linked to thi=
s Krshnaa-ism, but was looked at as the earlier brith of Krshna, not as a s=
eparate Divity in himself.
 
Whatever the case maybe, each school had its o=
wn set of established saints and scholars to vouch for their views. So it b=
oiled down to interpretation, which is often, as you rightly pointed out, b=
ased on various conditionings.
 
We human beings are creatures of imaginati=
on. Whenever an Avatar appears on the earth, most of the great Mahatmas who=
 appear after the Avatara, remain overawed by the character of the last Ava=
tara because invariable in the context of the desh-kaal-patra of those time=
s, the life of the Avatara shows actions performed which are way beyond ima=
gination for *those times*. Such a situation continues until the next Avata=
ra comes on earth. I am sure in the period after Rama, and before Krshna, o=
f which we have very little written record, the world at large remained ent=
irely overawed by Rama Avatara.
 
In this light Krshna is the Poorna-Avatar=
a. When Kalki will appear on earth, he will be invarible accompanied by a s=
et of powerful Rishis - every Avatara comes with his coterie of Rishis who =
explain the philosophy and spirituality of the Avatara to the general masse=
s - who will then create new scriptures and Kalki will be looked at as the =
crest jewel of the Avataras.
 
*  *   *
 
I believe in the evolutionary par=
able of these 9 Avatara because I find no other reason why these set of Ava=
tara, from the whole list of possible Avataras, have captured the popular i=
magination. I mean Dattatreya is an Avatara too as per SB. His spirituality=
 is no less than that of any other Avatara. Yet, he is not in the list of 9=
/10 Avataras. 
 
The original Nath Yogis used to consider Nine Chakras in t=
he Human Body. The idea of Kundalini Yoga also came from them, which was ba=
sically exploring cronologically all these nine chakras one after the other=
 by flooding them with Chit-Shakti.
 
There are 9 basic grahas in jyotish. =
Each graha could very well represent the essential nature of each chakra. A=
ll these make me more sanguine that there must be Nine Evolutionary Avatara=
s, not ten. In which case Kalki must be the Ninth Avatara.
 
Buddha, as you=
 rightly pointed out, has a tremendous logical appeal in Kali Yuga. But if =
logic is the criteria, then why not Adi Shankara? I may not agree to his ph=
ilosophy as it comes down to us from his followers, but it cannot be denied=
 that Adi Shankara was arguable one of the sharpest and most logical of spi=
ritual philosphers. His intellectual and logical mind is beyond doubt. Just=
 that Shankara never claimed himself to be an Avatara. Neither did Siddhart=
ha. Only that the later came 3000 years ago, and the former came possibly i=
n the last 1000 years. Shankara's spiritual impact on the world is no less =
than that of the Buddha. What mainstream Hinduism today is, could not have =
been, had it not been for the invaluable contribution of Adi Shankara. And =
if Buddha was truly the awaited 9th Avatara of Vishnu, Shankara would not h=
ave been able to absorb the philosophy of Buddha into Hinduism and thus mak=
e it lose its grip on India. Buddhism barely exists in land of its birth.
 =

All this taken together, make me more and more convinced that there are 9 =
evolutionary Avataras and the 9th is yet to come.
 
*  *  *
 
A little bit =
about Rama and Krshna. When I said I admire Rama, it is not a lip-service. =
There are incidents in the Ramayana which I find extremely inspiring, educa=
tive and uplifting. Like the incident where Rama was to cross the ocean. Ra=
ma knew very well that if he wanted, in one moment he could have used his D=
ivine Astras and forced the ocean to yield way to his army. Yet he sat in s=
ilent supplication for days, praying that the ocean allow his army safe pas=
sage. When all else failed, when genuine goodwill was not recirpocated, and=
 it was absolutely necessary to cross the ocean, THEN Rama took up weapons =
to get the job done. A powerful warrior, who knows very well how powerful h=
e himself is, not letting that sense of power pervert his mind even for a m=
oment is an amazing phenomenon. This kind of self-control is rare and worth=
y of comtemplation, specially by anyone who feels, ever so slightly, that h=
e/she has some form of power or influence in this world in any sphere. Rama=
 had no malice for anyone. Not even Ravana, by the end of the war at least.=
 He was the very personification of Satwa. In Satwa, conflict and malice an=
d cunningness are impossible.
 
Recently, a friend of mine told me that he =
has learnt all his life that one must listen to Krshna's advice, but only f=
ollow what Rama did, and not what Krshna did. I disagree with this vehement=
ly. If one reads entire Krshna's life with an objective mind, Krshna of Vrn=
davana, Krshna of Mathura, Krshna of Kurushetra, Krshna the Jagat Guru who =
speaks the Gita, one will find that what Krshna the Guru adviced in the Git=
a, Krshna the Divine Worker himself followed it all through his life at eve=
ry instance. It is his perfect detachment under all circumstances of life, =
from childhood to his death, that makes me wonder, was this a man or was th=
is a God? Can a man even do something like this? It is as if there is a par=
t of Krshna who is always separate from everything, and silently watches th=
e whole scene with a bemused smile. He had not a single personal stake in t=
he Mahabharata. Rama at least had his wife abducted for him to start a war =
against Ravana. But Krshna had zero personal stake in the Mahabharata. Afte=
r liberating his parents from Kamsa, very soon he went off to meet the Pand=
avas. From out of nowhere he forced himself into the politics of the Mahabh=
arata, and precipitated a great war to cleanse the world of burden. While L=
akshmana devoutly followed Rama all along the Ramayana and they were like a=
n inseparable pair, as Balarama in his next incarnation he could hardly und=
erstand Krshna. There are so many occassions where Balarama asks Krshna, wh=
at are they doing with all these kings, and that they should return to thei=
r village in Vrndavana. Krshna merely smiles. He knows that not everyone wi=
ll understand everything. But that cannot stop him from following his dharm=
a, with perfect detachement from eveyrthing of this plane. Neither false pr=
aises, nor wrong accusations by his close people can affect him one bit. An=
d I am not even counting the miracles he perfromed as a Divine Child. So I =
worship Krshna, because I have not yet met or heard of read of a single sad=
haka or saint or ordinary man or mahatma who has displayed this kind of per=
fected detachment through thick and thin, yet not withdrawing from the worl=
d or actively performing a larger dharma.
 
I started appreciating Swami Vi=
vekanada more after I understood a bit of the Krshna Avatara. That was the =
last known saint who lived a whirlwind life in the middle of a circus-stopl=
ight of fame and accusations, on one side adoring admirers and on the other=
 bitter enemies accusing him of being a heretic right upto the very end of =
his brief life, and yet none of that affected him to any great degree. He f=
aced terrific racism in the America, yet not a single speech of his reflect=
s the slightest trace of bitterness, anger, or negativity. That is such a f=
antastic achievement, IMHO.
 
I agree with you, Narasimha, for most of us i=
t is better to try to mould ones life with the same kind of supreme selfles=
sness that Rama showed all along. Not just worship Rama but more importantl=
y study his life and imbibe, to whatever degree possible, the quality he re=
presented. Maybe, just maybe, then the Unmanifested Reality - Shiva - will =
fix the mind so firmly on that Reality, that in some future life, in some l=
ater birth, one will be able to live life like Krshna showed, unattached an=
d unaffected by any dirt that the world throws up. And then the Universal C=
hit-Shakti (Adya Shakti) will flood such an individual with oppulence unima=
ginable, of this world and also of what lies in other worlds, like Krshna's=
 six oppulences - Infinite wealth, infinite beauty, infinite power/knowledg=
e, infinite fame, and infinite detachment from all the other five. 
 
 
Enj=

Jai Jai Rama Krshna Hari!

  =

Dear Rajarshi,
 
Even Parasara did not say there are just 9 or 10 avataras=
 or that there is a one-to-one correspondence to grahas. He too said there =
are innumerable avataras. Avataras can come with a combination of paramatma=
msas (supreme/absolute being portions) and jivatmamsas (living/relative bei=
ng portions) taken from grahas in any combination. Though 9 main avataras o=
f Vishnu came from paramatmamsas of 9 grahas, many many other avataras also=
 descended on earth due to various other combinations of paramatmamsas and =
jivatmamsas of the same 9 grahas! There are obviously many possibilities.
 =

In fact, Parasara says that ALL beings contain some paramatmamsa and some =
jivatmamsa, coming from grahas. But jivatmamsa is predominant in most of us=
.
 
When one leaves earth, paramatmamsas in one return to respective grahas=
 and jivatmamsas take birth again based on desires. In the 'end', even the =
jivatmamsas return to respective grahas. At the time of Mahapralaya, grahas=
 also merge back in Supreme Lord.
 
*        *        *
 
As for Kalki, Par=
asara did not clarify and we can only speculate. Though some people associa=
te him with lagna, that makes no sense to me either. That is inconsistent w=
ith the overall framework laid by Parasara (i.e. beings born with combinati=
ons of paramatmamsas and jivatmamsas from *grahas*).
 
Kalki will probably =
come with paramatmamsas of both Sun and Moon. After all, Kalki shows Shiva =
and Shakti (Sun and Moon - soul and mind) coming together finally!! Just a =
speculation..
 
*        *        *
 
Whether you take 9 or 10 or 22 avatar=
as, the theory of evolutionary spiritual perfection does not add up because=
 "perfection" occurred before the last avatara, unless you break away from =
main scriptures and throw away Buddha (and discount Kalki as he has not com=
e yet).
 
*        *        *
 
Rather than "evolution", it is a matter of =
what the world needs at that time. If people at the beginning of Satya yuga=
 are established in Self always and the only issue is that a small attachme=
nt may develop now and then, disturbing that state of being established in =
Self (i.e. stealing of Veda!), then the aspect of consciousness that is rel=
evant is "spirit of detachment" (Ketu). If invoked, it removes that attachm=
ent and takes one back to being established in Self. So an avatara correspo=
nding to Ketu occurred.
 
As collective consciousness became denser, being =
established in Self became less natural and more effort was needed. So the =
"spirit of patience, persistence and hard-work" (Saturn) became relevant an=
d an avatara corresponding to Saturn occurred. And so on.
 
In the dark age=
s of Kali yuga, rational minds wouldn't accept anything that didn't "make s=
ense". Being established in Self became an unnatural, ridiculous and incomp=
rehensible notion. So the "spirit of comprehension" (Mercury) became releva=
nt. An avatara corresponding to Mercury occurred and tried to explain being=
 established in Self as a comprehensible notion, so that rational minds of =
that age would accept it to an extent and attempt it.
 
Avataras occur base=
d on the needs of collective consciousness. Of course, if one's consciousne=
ss is in a different state from the collective consciousness of that time, =
the current avatara may not be relevant to one.
 
*        *        *
 
> I=
 respect Rama, but I worship Krshna.
 
I am awestruck by Krishna and worshi=
p him, but I see Rama as an ideal that I MAY be able to emulate oneday. In =
fact, I recommend the approach to others.
 
Though I said Rama and Krishna =
are almost the same, there is a difference between soul and perfected mind.=
 Soul is a spark of Shiva and a perfected mind is a spark of Chit Shakti (w=
hereas an imperfect mind is a spark of Maya shakti).

	Dear Narasimha,
	 
	Jai Ma!
	
	
	Just to clarify, I may have a special=
 liking for Krshna, but my aim is obvious not to demean Rama, or any other =
special form of God. Just clarifying incase someone gets the wrong impressi=
on. I respect Rama, but I worship Krshna.
	 
	<<More importantly, if your u=
nderstanding is correct, why isn't perfection occurring in the FINAL incarn=
ation but occurring well before?>>
	
	Good question!  
	 
	That is because,=
 SB is not concerned with the dasavatara. It lists 22 Avataras! It deals wi=
th the idea of Avataran, but not with the idea of 9/10 fixed Avataras. It a=
lso lists Varaha Avatara as the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya as the 10 in its li=
st of 22. It is only in other puranas, that we get the focus on 10 Avatars,=
 and the term becomes popular. 
	 
	And ONLY when we take these 9/10 Avatar=
as, in a fixed sequence of appearence, that we get the popular concept of D=
asavatara. Else no. I find the evolutionary link in this concept of 9/10 Av=
ataras too compelling to be ignored.  
	 
	<<After all, "entire divinity" c=
annot be encapsulated by any form>>
	
	
	This, I am in total agreement with=
. Infact, in the 10th Chapter of Gita when the Supreme explains the various=
 vibhutis, this One is not even Krshna, but has transcended every limitatio=
n of conception. Hence, the One says, among those who weild weapons, it is =
Rama, and among the Vrishnis it is Krshna! Etc..
	 
	<<First, he IS mention=
ed in SB list of avataras as well as Parasara's list. If he does not "fit" =
in your "scheme of evolutionary Avatars", then your concept is possibly wro=
ng and avataras are perhaps not "evolutionary" as you theorize.>>
	
	As I s=
aid, the SB list contains 22 Avataras. It does not focus on the idea of 9/1=
0 Avataras! That is my point. If you take 22 Avataras, then these link to g=
rahas are not of any use. For these nine grahas, individually or in combina=
tion, will represent all Avataras, or for that matter everything else in th=
is Universe.
	 
	Secondly, if we take 10 Avatars and corresponding grahas f=
or each, then what must Kalki be? Lagna? But lagna is not a graha.
	 
	Or, =
just surmising, can it be possible that until an Avatara actually descends =
on the earth, his energy and his force cannot be attributed to any graha, b=
ut once he does appear, it reconfigures things completely? We can only know=
 after the last Avatara comes.
	 
	Anyway, I am not looking at this main Av=
atars from the point of grahas/jyotish at all. For that matter, some tradit=
ions consider Balarama to be an Avatara rather than Buddha.
	 
	 
	The conc=
ept of Avatara and Vibhutis comes from the Gita. These two are slightly dif=
ferent. Avatara is a special descent of God, Paramatma, which appears on th=
is world during times of severe crisis to cause a drastic and fundamental t=
ransition. A Vibhuti is a limited force of God which can appear to help out=
, directly or indirectly, in any transition. A Vibuti need not be spiritual=
. It could be in any field of work. Sometimes a Vibhuti may not even be awa=
re of its purpose, unlike an Avatara.
	 
	Basically, whenever we see excell=
ence in any form, in any field, it is always the energy of the One at work.=
.

	Namaste Rajarshi,
	 
	Very nice t=
o hear from you!
	 
	The "unmistakeable" link to the *physical* evolution o=
f life on earth does not imply an increasing sequence of *spiritual* perfec=
tion, as you cannot directly map the physical to the spiritual. More import=
antly, if your understanding is correct, why isn't perfection occurring in =
the FINAL incarnation but occurring well before?
	 
	*        *        *
	 =

	First, regarding Krishna being a "poornavatara", SrimadBhagavatam (SB) do=
es not say that Rama is not one. In fact, Parasara, father of Vyasa, explic=
itly mentioned that Rama, Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha are "poornavataras"=
 (used that exact expression) while other avataras have some amount of jiva=
tmamsa too (though paramatmamsa dominates jivatmamsa).
	 
	Secondly, after =
describing the avataras, SB says that there are in fact innumerable avatara=
s and that all rishis, munis, manus, demigods etc are avataras of Supreme L=
ord. It is under THAT context that 1.3.28 then proceeds to say "these avata=
ras are partial, while Krishna is Lord Himself." I question if the deductio=
n that Krishna *alone* is Lord Himself and Rama is not is accurate! It only=
 seems to say that all these rishis, manus, demigods etc are partial. As I =
said above, Pararsara explicitly said that both Rama and Krishna are poorna=
vataras.
	 
	Third, let us ask a very fundamental question: What exactly do=
es it mean if an avatara is "Lord Himself"?
	 
	*        *        *
	 
	Whi=
le SB talks of Krishna being "Lord Himself" in 1.3.28, it also says in 1.3.=
30: "forms of Supreme Lord, who is in reality formless (arUpa) and of the n=
ature of pure consciousness (chidAtman), are manufactured by the qualities =
of Maya". In the next verse, it further compares forms of Lord to clouds in=
 sky and dirt in air. Just as sky *contains* clouds and is beyond them, sim=
ilarly Lord *contains* forms and is beyond them. So, again, what is the mea=
ning of a specific form that descended on earth being "Lord Himself"? I am =
afraid people may be misinterpreting this notion based on their fancies and=
 conditioning..
	 
	All beings are made up of paramatma (supreme/absolute b=
eing) and jivatma (living/relative being). The latter portion is dominant i=
n us and is responsible for desires and rebirth. Great avataras descend fro=
m a higher portion of paramatma. Very rarely avataras descend entirely from=
 paramatma without ANY jivatma portion. Rama and Krishna are specific examp=
les given by Parasara.
	 
	They are entirely divine, but they do not encaps=
ulate the entire divinity!!!! After all, "entire divinity" cannot be encaps=
ulated by any form just as no cloud can contain the entire sky. They take p=
art in the drama obeying and executing the divine will but NOT altering it.=
 This applies to Krishna as well as Rama.
	 
	*        *        *
	 
	> Bud=
dha was great spiritual force in this world. But I do not
	> see him fit in=
 the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His
	> realization, the one he advocat=
ed, is a static realization,
	> an end in a void.
	 
	First, he IS mentione=
d in SB list of avataras as well as Parasara's list. If he does not "fit" i=
n your "scheme of evolutionary Avatars", then your concept is possibly wron=
g and avataras are perhaps not "evolutionary" as you theorize.
	 
	Secondly=
, as per Parasara, Buddha corresponds to Mercury, who personifies logical m=
ind and the spirit of investigation and comprehension. Logical mind and its=
 spirit of comprehension are inherently fallible. Even a perfected spirit o=
f comprehension is not capable of grasping the Absolute Reality completely,=
 for it is beyond comprehension. So, no wonder it simplifies the Incomprehe=
nsible in an attempt to comprehend! That is what Buddha ended up doing. How=
ever, logical mind has a great appeal in the Age of Reason in this Kali yug=

 this age.

	If you dismiss Parasara's linking of=
 planets to avataras as a possible corruption, are you absolutely sure that=
 the verses of SB you are relying on are perfect? (In any case, it's a diff=
erent matter that you are only taking some SB verses and ignoring some as I=
 showed!.)
	 
	The bottomline as far as I am concerned is that Pararsara's =
list actually makes amazingly coherent esoteric sense. The nature of each a=
spect of consciousness (e.g. Buddha - spirit of comprehension, Saturn - spi=
rit of patience & persistence, Venus - spirit of happiness etc) and the sto=
ry of corresponding avatara DOES have a highly meaningful connection, esote=
rically speaking. After all, esoterically is how you really need to underst=
and any higher scriptures and notions in them.
	 
	If we take scriptures li=
terally instead and draw lopsided conclusions, some would conclude that Shi=

de that Surya is the "supreme" one and other deities are "inferior"; and so=
 on.

	On a different note, someone may think tha=
t Kali, being Aadyaa, is superior to Tara and like Kali more. But, some lea=
rned yogis have declared them to be essentially the same and some scripture=
s even prohibited differentiating between them. As I see it, the difference=
 between them is too subtle for even rishis to clearly comprehend. People s=
eeing some significant difference between them are, I am afraid, merely pro=
jecting their own conditioning. Same in the case of Krishna and Rama. Both =
were  perfectly detached and fully divine karma yogis.
	 
	If we think abou=
t it, perfected mind (paramatma aspect represented by Moon) and soul (param=
atma aspect represented by Sun) are not really that different. So I am afra=
id Krishna and Rama are not that different, though the specifics of their s=
tories may be different.
	 
	One last word though. If someone truly believe=
s that Krishna is superior to Rama and worships Krishna (or vice versa!), I=
 am very happy for such a person. My arguments are more for the sake of sha=
ring thinking/knowledge and pushing the boundaries of understanding in the =
long run, than changing the minds of anyone in the short run. In the end, e=
veryone of us will have to go through one's own cycles of various tamasik, =
rajasik and saattwik stages of evolution before one starts grasping some fi=
stfuls of Reality. These concepts are too subtle for anyone to convince oth=
ers or be absolutely confident oneself!

		Namaste,

		
		Jai Ma!
		

		I have a different view point. Let=
 me write down as I see it, in point by point manner.

		1. In the Bhagwata=
 Purana, there are a list of 22 Avataras of Vishnu. In this list of 22, Var=
aha Avatara is the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya is the 10th Avatara. Dattatreya,=
 Nara-narayana,Vyasa Deva himself are in this list, and then the Bhagawata =
Purana goes ontu mention that the Avatars of Vishnu are innumerable. In the=
 10th Canto, Vyasa says all these Avatars, and innumerable others, are amsa=
s of the Supreme Being while Krshna is "swayam Bhagawan."

		2. Of these va=
rious possible Avataras, 10, or rather 9 as I believe, are/have been accord=
ed special mention and significance across various Hindu spiritual literatu=
re, specially those which were composed in the Kali-Yuga, namely the Purana=
s.[When Krshna was alive, it was Kali-Sandhya, his physical presence had cu=
rtailed the full effect of Kali,once he left his body, Kali started in full=
 flow. All Puranas were composed after this, hence these are scriptures of =
the Kali-Yuga, as are Tantras]

		3. These 10/9 Avataras have a fixed seque=
nce of appearance. Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, R=
ama, Krshna, (Buddha) and Kalki. There is an unmistakeable connection of th=
e form and sequence of these main avatars with the evolution of life on ear=
th. From the aquatic, to the amphibian, to the land-animal, to the half-ani=
mal-half-man, to the dwarf man (first human life form who immediately takes=
 possession of this earth represented by Vamana's 3 steps), to the Rajashik=
 avatara of Parashurama moving around with an axe, to the Sattwa Guna Avata=
ra of Rama, to the Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, this indicates that spi=
rituality is not to be separated into another world, but is a progressive r=
ealization of the various manifestation and potentials that lie inherent in=
 the consciousness and its development through various life-forms. Larger s=
pirituality of earth and evolution go hand in hand. That is Nature's grand =
design for life on earth.

		4. In this specifc context, I am only focusing=
 on the parable of these main 9/10 Avatars. It is not my contention that if=
 one worships say Matysa Avatara, one will not attain to a state of liberat=
ion of the soul. As is the nature of spiritual cosmology in Hinduism, any D=
evata can lead a person to any depth of realization. And each one of the Av=
atars of Vishnu are self-realized in their own way and can be consider supe=
r-massive spiritual dynamos.
		
		
		
		 5. Of these, naturally, Rama and K=
rshna are most adored because they represent a stage of evolution, both ins=
ide as well as outside, which society can relate of much easier, in this ag=
e. Rama represents, for me, the stage of most satwic mind. A satwic mind is=
 in control of itself. It known how to transform the animal tendencies with=
in and without - monkeys - into a constructive force for a greater purpose.=
 However, as with a state of full Sattwa Guna, there can be instances, even=
 though few, of dejection. For it is static in nature and will change only =
when circumstances force it to. As per the Valmiki Ramayana, Rama did feel =
dejected while searching for Sita in the forest. He did have a moments fear=
 before the final assault on Ravana, which was dispelled by Agsatha when th=
e later revealed the stotra of the Sun to Rama. At the end of the final bat=
tle, Rama tells Sita, in a most dispassionate manner, that he killed Ravana=
 not to rescue her, but it was the Dharma to do so, and to unhold his famil=
y honour. That too was the dharma of that age when he lived, family honor. =
The way I look at this grand epic, and I bow humbly to the genius of Rishis=
 Valmiki for representing the things as they are, as a scribe, as a poet, a=
s an observer, and not adding his own preferences to it anywhere, in the 14=
 years of tribulation that Rama faced which culminated into his killing Rav=
ana, he changed into the most dispassionate leader, such that no personal c=
onsideration or emotions or passions can overturn the Rajadharma. His life =
is a lesson of what a true leader must be! Krshna, OTOH, had this immaculat=
e detachment right from birth. I am not taking his  supernatural feats into=
 account. It is his singular and constant detachment from situations, from =
people, from environment, from circumstances that mark his life. At the age=
 of eight, he decides to leave Vrindavana for Mathura. All his friends, his=
 foster parents, his village-folks who so loved him, pleaded with him that =
it would make no sense for him to leave the shelter, love and comfort of hi=
s happy, settled village life and head into an unknown destiny and destinat=
ion. Krshna tried to reason with them, then he understood that they won't u=
nderstand, he promised he will return back once his work in Mathura is over=
. He never returned. Later, much later, when the Gopis came to him asking h=
im to participate in their dance, he obliged. But the moment some of them s=
tarted getting jealous and possessive of Krshna, he removed himself quietly=
 from the scene, saying that he belongs to everyone equally and no one has =
any special right over him. When Shishupala abused Krshna, the later merely=
 kept dropping flowers on the floor, smiling and counting. The moment the 1=
00th abuse was over, he swiftly cut off Shishupala's head and was back into=
 his poise. But when Bhurishrava unfairly accused Krshna of being a revolut=
ionist and charlatan, Krshna did not kill him. When Duryodhana, who used to=
 think of Krshna as another black magician, wanted to arrest him, Krshna sh=
owed his vikarala roopa in the assembly of kings, yet he did not finish the=
 enemies off. The very next moment he was back into his own poised self. Ne=
ver in the whole Mahabharata is there one instance of his going overboard, =
never a single shade of depression, equivocation, or lack of confidence in =
his actions, irrespective of what others say or think of him. And then righ=
t in the middle of the greatest war he had the perfect equipoise to deliver=
 the most sublime spiritual philosophy. That is why his life remains the be=
st ideal of Karma-Yoga. For a true Karma-Yogi by definition can never be de=
jected. It is impossible. Neither the action nor the results belong to the =
instrument. When running away from the battle-field and killing Kaliya Yava=
na, or when advising Bheema to tear apart Jarashanda, or gesturing Bheema t=
o hit Duryodhana below the waist, or getting Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krsh=
na, as if by some Divine Intuition, knew exactly how the situations must be=
 lined up which would cause the destruction of these people. This kind of k=
nowledge cannot come by the rational thinking. But happens when one is cons=
tantly and consciously connected to the Universal Force. We do not find the=
se kind of complex situations in the Rama Avatara, at least in the Valmiki =
Ramayana. Of course, if we take the Adhbut Ramayana or such other auxilliar=
y texts and retelling, we get a different picture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana =
we have a 1000 headed demon attacking Rama after he kills Ravana, and then =
Sita turns into Adya Shakti and demolishes the 1000 headed demon and Rama w=
orships her. But if we take only the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the pict=
ure that emerges is very clear. Rama is the embodiment of Sattwic mind. The=
refore he displays all the great characteristics of satwa, chief of which i=
s self-control, as well as the occasional sadness caused due to separation =
from his wife Sita whom, at least until Ravana was destroyed, he loved very=
 dearly. Satwa guna creates a true saint, but can also cause some grief whe=
n the stability is shaken. Krshna was gunatita. He had no attachment to any=
thing in this world - man, women, deva, danava, friend, enemy - and therefo=
re he was never affected any trace of negative emotion. His Ananda never le=
ft him even in the most trying situations. 6. Buddha was great spiritual fo=
rce in this world. But I do not see him fit in the scheme of evolutionary A=
vatars. His realization, the one he advocated, is a static realization, an =
end in a void. This is clearly denying of the reality of this earth. I find=
 this not in tune with what either Rama or Krshna espoused. None of them ne=
gated this world. If negation of this world and life is the final aim, then=
 why send so many avatars at crucial stages of evolutionary development? If=
 the spiritual impact on masses is the reason for Buddha being an Avatara, =
then why not Jesus or Zorathrusta.? They are no less impactful in that sens=
e. But do they fit in the scheme of spiritual line that these 9 Avataras of=
 Narayana indicate in a most logical manner? No. As such many vaishnava tra=
ditions in parts of India, do not consider Buddha to be an avatara. Realiza=
tion, to be complete and holistic, must be both static and dynamic, outside=
 of life as well as inside of life. That is why the Tantras formed their ow=
n kind of spiritual philosophy, of the world as body of Shakti and therefor=
e an object of reverence and realization. 7. The original literature of the=
 Nath Yogis used to mention 9 chakras. These are centers of psychological f=
unctions. 6 inside the human body and 3 too subtle, or non-developed in mos=
t people, even seekers. It is my belief that each of the 9 Avataras - exclu=
ding Buddha - correspond to the full power and force of one of these 9 Chak=
ras. Similarly, the 9 grahas, or that which can modify consciousness or all=
ow the consciousness to explore and express itself is various possiblities,=
 are 9 in number. The lagna is a reference point and not a graha. Therefore=
 the chief Avatars who represent the parable of evolution are nine in numbe=
r. And the ninth of the sequence is yet to come. 8. I cannot comment on whi=
ch graha would typically represent which Avatara. I know of what the BPHS s=
ays, however, it is my belief - feel free to disagree with it -:)[one canno=
t rule out some deep-rooted corruption of understanding or textual misrepre=
sentation in this Kali-Yuga] - that the Atmah among the Avataras has not ye=
t appeared. It will be Kalki, or as Vimalananda seems to say in the Aghora =
books, Nishkalanka - the stainless one. There is only one thing which is pe=
rfectly stainless, the Atmah .After a Nirguna/Gunatita awastha comes living=
 in the full and complete purity and might and force and strength of the At=
mah. By the sheer dint of his purity the last Avatara will burn away opposi=
ng forces of this world and fulfill the purpose of evolution. Even Krshna u=
sed diplomacy at various points in his adult life to achieve his ends. Kalk=
i, I am speculating, won't even need that. The white horse and that sword i=
s a metaphor. He will be the only one capable enough to rectify the various=
 errors and corruptions that beset our age. Well, this is how I look at the=
 story of Avataras. It is perfectly ok not to agree with my views, but I am=
 reasonably sanguine now that this is what is closer to truth. -Regards  Ra=

s!
		

		  
		Namaste friends,   There was a discussion on Lord Vishnu's Da=
savataras on a limited access forum on Facebook. A learned friend wrote tha=
t "Krshna is the God-man", "Previous Avatars are a build-up to this stage" =
and "Buddha after Krshna is like going back from the linear progression of =
spirituality that the Avatars manifest one after the other upto Krshna".   =
I want to emphatically disagree with this notion that Dasavatars of a "line=
ar progression of spirituality..upto Krshna".   *        *        *   Each =
avatara represents an aspect of Supreme in a perfected form.   Maharshi Par=
asara equated dasavataras with planets. For example, Rama, Krishna and Nara=
simha are Sun, Moon and Mars, respectively.   We also know that Sun, Moon, =
Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are personifications o=
f soul, mind, energy/initiative/drive, learning spirit, wisdom/discriminati=
on, spirit of enjoyment/being happy, patience/discipline, spirit of innovat=
ion/breaking barriers and detachment (respectively).   Correspondingly, eac=
h avatara is an expression of that aspect of Supreme in a perfected form. E=
ach story is an example of how that aspect operates.   Lord Rama's story is=
 a perfected example of how soul operates. Lord Krishna's story is a perfec=
ted example of how mind operates. Lord Vamana's story is a perfected exampl=
e of how wisdom/discrimination operates. Lord Narasimha's story is a perfec=
ted example of how energy/drive/initiative operates.   *        *        * =
  Now, let us remember one basic thing. Soul in us, mind in us, energy in u=
s, learning spirit in us, wisdom in us, happiness in us, discipline/patienc=
e in us - all these are different manifestations of the same Self. However,=
 when Self manifests as these different aspects, it has different qualities=
 and plays different roles. There is no comparison between them.   We MAY f=
ocus on one aspect of us first, perfect it and then perfect other aspects t=
hrough it. But, we need balance between all aspects in the end. Similarly, =
these different aspects of Supreme Being are incomparable and are in a bala=
nce working together in the Cosmos.   *        *        *   One who is fasc=
inated by the qualities of soul may like the story that demonstrates how so=
ul operates; one who is fascinated by the qualities of mind may like the st=
ory that demonstrates how mind operates, and one who is fascinated by the q=
ualities of wisdom may like the story that demonstrates how wisdom operates=
. And so on. But this is just a matter of taste and subjective preference. =
  *        *        *   Let us focus on Rama and Krishna, i.e. soul and min=
d. Soul is seen as a representative of god in us, because of some basic att=
ributes of it. It is the higher self and has no agendas, no likes or dislik=
es.   Once mind fancies a separate existence with some agendas/desires, sou=
l supports the individualized consciousness stemming from that fancy and se=
es it as its dharma. It lends strength and support to EVERY aspect of this =
individualized consciousness (e.g. mind, energy, intellect, learning abilit=
y, enjoyment, discipline etc). It supports them fully and yet has no desire=
s/agendas/likes/dislikes of its own! It impassionately witnesses and record=
s all of one's agendas and karmas so that Laws of Nature give proper fruits=
 later on. It does all that despite full awareness that it is neither doing=
 those karmas nor receiving the fruits. As mind and other aspects of the in=
dividualized consciousness entertain the notion that they are doing things =
and begetting the fruits, soul supports them fully in this play. It sees th=
at as its dharma and does it impassionately.   Now, does this sound excitin=
g? Perhaps not to all. This functionality of an impassionate witness suppor=
ting the play, may not seem interesting enough to some.   On the other hand=
, mind has likes, dislikes and agendas. It is constantly pursuing those age=
ndas, getting things and achieving things. Movement of mind is what keeps t=
he individualization going!!! Though soul is the support for everything els=
e in the individualized consciousness, soul is a witness doing its dharma i=
mpassionately. It is mind that keeps the individualization going and brings=
 in agendas and passion and even decides/affects every entity's dharma. Tha=
t way, mind is really the "boss" of the individualization. No wonder Krishn=
a's life appeals more to one who may be excited by this description!   *   =
     *        *   Lord Krishna is obviously awe-inspiring, but let me put R=
ama's life in perspective.   Rama's life demonstrates how soul operates. At=
 a young age, he received Brahma Jnana from Vasishtha and became realized. =
Yet, he did whatever was his "dharma". He helped Vishwamitra. Soon after ma=
rriage, he was given kingdom. At the last moment, his father banished him t=
o forest at the behest of his step-mother and his step-brother was given th=
e throne. He had no complaints. Though his father, step-mother and step-bro=
ther felt guilty to various degrees, he himself supported and consoled all =
three and followed his dharma impassionately. Though he knew leaving Sita i=
n the forest with Lakshmana and going after the golden deer would cause pro=
blems, he did it impassionately when Sita insisted. When she was kidnapped =
by Ravana, he searched for her and fought the battle. He never faulted Sita=
 for forcing him to leave her or faulted Lakshmana for leaving her later. H=
e accepted every life situation with no complaints and did the best possibl=
e action then. Even as he killed Ravana, he did so without hatred or anger,=
 but as his impassionate dharma. Even as Ravana was dying, he went to him a=
nd respectfully learned some subjects that were going to disappear with Rav=
ana!   Rama is a perfect example of a liberated man with no desires or agen=
das who impassionately discharges one's dharma arising from the momentum of=
 karmas before liberation. THAT is basically what soul does!   *        *  =
      *   As another example, let us look at Lord Vaamana. His story is a p=
erfect demonstration of how wisdom/discrimination operates.   He was born a=
s a learned pygmy. He filled the entire cosmos to rid earth of a charitable=
 demon king with many great qualities.   Wisdom/discrimination makes one hu=
mble and unassuming. When one is doing good work but tainted with demonic q=
ualities (e.g. pride or attachment), one's discrimination is not pleased un=
til that pride is suppressed. When wisdom fills one's entire consciousness,=
 then demonic qualities are completely suppressed.   *        *        *   =
Please think about the other avataras. The stories can be understood as per=
fect demonstrations of how various aspects of our consciousness operate, ba=
sed on clues from Maharshi Parasara.   Let us not compare Dasavataras, but =
celebrate each of them separately. Of course, if you are more attracted to =
one of them, please think about that avatara more and develop devotion. The=
y are ALL capable of relieving us from samsara.   *        *        *   By =
the way, happy Hanumajjayanti to those who celebrate it today (there are di=
fferent schools of thought).   Best regards, Narasimha -------- Astrology &=
