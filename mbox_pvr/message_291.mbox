Well, all shastras are clear. Common Hindu understanding is clear. Millions 
of Hindus mention the current yuga as Kali yuga before doing any pooja and 
religiously keep count of the years that passed in Kali yuga. Moreover, when 
I see the happenings in the world and how dharma is deteriorating compared 
to even a few hundred years back, I cannot think that anything other than 
Kali yuga is running right now. I reject the notion that Kali yuga is only 
1200 years and that we are in Dwapara yuga right now.

Even great souls can advance incorrect or partially correct understanding at 
times, because there is some purpose.

I reject the teaching of Yukteshwar Maharaj related to yugas and yet retain 
respect for him and his lineage.

Best regards,
Narasimha
