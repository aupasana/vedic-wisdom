Namaste Sir,

=C2=A0
I live in greater Boston. I am not aware of any priest=
s in this area who can fix this. I know a priest who did these things befor=
e, but he is in India. I was unable to contact another Boston priest relate=
d to him, who I suspected could take care of this.
=C2=A0
People may give y=
ou various mantras for this purpose. But they may or may not work. If Tendu=
lkar or Dhoni tells you how you can play a good shot on a particular kind o=
f ball, you may not be able to play that shot right away. Even if it is an =
easy shot, it may take a lot of practice for you to get it right. Even with=
 mantras, one needs enough focused practice for them to work for one.

=C2=
=A0
In general, it is far easier (relatively) to fix weakness of mind and p=
rotect it, before it reaches a crisis point like this. Hanuman, Bhairava, C=
handi, Narasimha - so many deities can be worshipped for this purpose. Howe=
ver, fixing it after it reaches a crisis point requires someone who has eno=
ugh shakti and knows how to direct it.
=C2=A0
Some replies referred to sain=
ts/swamis who are very pure/elevated etc. Even if one is pure or elevated, =
one may not necessarily be able to help. This really requires some shakti a=
nd the ability to direct it for this specific task.

=C2=A0
Though I live i=
n the area, I am not capable of doing anything personally. However, if anyb=
ody in troubles like this is interested and visits me, I can give some ash =
from my daily homam of divine Mother. They can apply it on the forehead of =
the person everyday. Of course, I don't know if it will help in any way.
=
=C2=A0
If interested, please send a private email to pvr108@....

=C2=
=A0Best regards,

Narasimha

 the Rudrayamala, at least some versions of the Rudrayamala. This child Bha=

 quite impossible to rid the problem by any exorcist from a distance. These=
 days almost no one has that kind of terrific shakti to cure a case of poss=
ession from a distance. Physical presence in front of the victim is a must =
for the one trying to help.=C2=A0So close family members, who live with the=
 girl will have to do the sadhana. If you go through the Bhairava homam man=
ual by Narasimha, you will find methods of doing homas with this mantra. Bu=
t I guess being in a foreign land homas may not be that easy.
>
>If the fam=
ily visits India, then I have a suggestion. Please ask them, if possible, t=
o visit Kashi and then go to either the Kalabhairava or Vatuka Bhairava tem=
ple. Once inside the temple speak to the main priest stating the problem. A=
round these two temples in Kashi, many excellent sadhakas of Bhairava live =
who are adepts in removing any kind of negative influence. They may charge =
a certain fee for the ritual and then ask the parents and the girl to come =
with some specific samagris on a specific day/tithi inside the temple and t=

 method. I am sure their maybe other methods too. I just wrote what came to=

>A possession by a foreig=
n entity, IF genuine, is always a very serious matter. For there are variou=

>Upayas are many. As so many diff=
erent people have advised, these all sadhanas *can* work, theoretically, bu=
t whether any one of them will actually work in a specific case or not depe=
nds on multiple factors. Basically, there is no guarantee of any method. It=
 all depends on what kind of spirit(s)/being(s) has possessed the individua=
l and what their link for the same is. By link it means one has to find out=
 the root, or source of exactly what action allowed them to enter into the =
person. Sometimes it can be something as simple as spitting somewhere (wher=
e this being(s) reside), or
 causally entering into their territory and bei=
ng susceptible to such possession by certain weakness in the mind and body,=
 or in some cases where such entities are deliberately send to cause harm t=
o an individual, ETC ETC. Whatever be the source, there is no sure shot one=
 stop method of removing and handling such a situation. It all depends on t=
he shakti of the spirit, and the amount of shakti that those trying to help=
 are able to generate in order to remove the spirit.Moreover, if the spirit=
 of a violent and extremely malevolent nature, then unless the person tryin=
g to remove it is an adept in this, he/she may come to serious harm.
>
>The=
se things like removing possession are specializations. These do not fall u=
nder the ambit of normal sadhana. Unless one knows well what one is getting=
 into, any sadhaka with even basic common sense would do best to stay away.=
 Every action has its repercussion and one must know well how to handle the=
 same too. Again
 if a spirit is removed by force before the time till whic=
h, based on previous karma, it was supposed to be in possession of the indi=
vidual, then that too starts a new karmic chain which will involve some not=
 so pleasant consequences for the person who tried to remove the spirit. It=
 is all a complex chain.
>
>[Reminds me of a particular individual I knew s=
ome years ago who was an expert in exorcism. But before starting any exorci=
sm he would ask his Guides to tell him about the spirit as well as the time=
 frame for which the spirit would stay in possession as per the previous ka=
rmic link between the spirit and the victim. Then he would sit and do ritua=
ls daily to entice the spirit to leave the body of its own free will, promi=
sing good deeds for the spirit in return. Never trying to remove it by forc=
e. Most cases it would work. Rare cases where the spirit is of a very viole=
nt nature, force had to be applied.]
>
>Best thing to do is a) find someone=

 who knows exactly how to deal with spirit possession and hope for the bes=
t. b) In the event the first is not possible, ask family members to pick sa=
dhana/mantra of any deity - preferably Bhairava, Kali, Chandi, Narasimha,pa=
nchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are better) - and do it with samkalpa =
with sufficient force and will and time. Which means, a 10-20 mins path of =
hanuman chalisa may not help. Depends on the degree of possession. Someone =
may have to spend 3-5 hours daily with any sadhana with the mental belief/f=
aith/will/determination to see this through to the very end. While doing th=
e sadhana keep a bowl of water in a copper pot, and then either make the po=
ssessed individual drink the water or sprinkle it on him/her. And pray as h=
ard as possible.

br>I don't know about foreign countries. I am sure there too one can find g=
ood exorcists, maybe not of our religion. <br><br>I have very little knowle=
dge about Panchamukhi Hanumana, infact unfortunately have never ever tried =
any sadhana of Lord Hanumana till date.<br><br>However, there is a particul=
ar mantra of Lord Bhairava which is considered to be of excellent potency f=
or these kind of problems. This form of Bhairava is a small child, known as=
 Vatuka. As per some Tantrik scriptures He is also referred to as the one w=
hose mother is Sahashra Chandika. References to this form can be found in t=
he Rudrayamala, at least some versions of the Rudrayamala. This child Bhair=
ava has been invoked for centuries by followers of Shakta/Aghor traditions =
for protection against spirits, and specially during rituals
 of cremation =
ground. <br><br>The standard mantra is (there are many variations of this m=
antra too, all are good):<span style=3D"font-weight:normal;"><span style=3D=
"font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;"><br><br>"Om Hreem Vatukaay Aapad Uddhaar=
nnaay Kuru Kuru Vatukaay Hreem Om"<br><br></span></span><span style=3D"font=
-weight:normal;"><span style=3D"font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">Generally=
, at least 10/11 malas of the same should be done in one sitting. And this =
should be continued daily till such time that there is some visible relief.=
 One more thing is that, IF, this is a really genuine instance of spirit po=
ssession, as far as I have seen, it would be quite impossible to rid the pr=
oblem by any exorcist from a distance. These days almost no one has that ki=
nd of terrific shakti to cure a case of possession from a distance. Physica=
l presence in front of the victim is a must for the one trying to help.&nbs=
p;So close family members, who live with the girl will
 have to do the sadh=
ana. If you go through the Bhairava homam manual by Narasimha, you will fin=
d methods of doing homas with this mantra. But I guess being in a foreign l=
and homas may not be that easy.<br><br>If the family visits India, then I h=
ave a suggestion. Please ask them, if possible, to visit Kashi and then go =
to either the Kalabhairava or Vatuka Bhairava temple. Once inside the templ=
e speak to the main priest stating the problem. Around these two temples in=
 Kashi, many excellent sadhakas of Bhairava live who are adepts in removing=
 any kind of negative influence. They may charge a certain fee for the ritu=
al and then ask the parents and the girl to come with some specific samagri=
s on a specific day/tithi inside the temple and then perform their rituals.=
 Many I know have actually benefited. This is one method. I am sure their m=
aybe other methods too. I just wrote what came to my mind. <br><br>Hope thi=
s
 helps.<br><br>-Regards<br> Rajarshi<br><br></span></span><div style=

 monaco, monospace, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">Namaste Sir,<br><br>A posse=
ssion by a foreign entity, IF genuine, is always a very serious matter. For=
 there are various classes and kinds and types of entities which can posses=
s an individual and some of them can be downright nasty.<br><br>Upayas are =
many. As so many different people have advised, these all sadhanas *can* wo=
rk, theoretically, but whether any one of them will actually work in a spec=
ific case or not depends on multiple factors. Basically, there is no guaran=
tee of any method. It all depends on what kind of spirit(s)/being(s) has po=
ssessed the individual and what their link for the same is. By link it mean=
s one has to find out the root, or source of exactly what action allowed th=
em to enter into the person. Sometimes it can be something as simple as spi=
tting somewhere (where this being(s) reside), or
 causally entering into th=
eir territory and being susceptible to such possession by certain weakness =
in the mind and body, or in some cases where such entities are deliberately=
 send to cause harm to an individual, ETC ETC. Whatever be the source, ther=
e is no sure shot one stop method of removing and handling such a situation=
. It all depends on the shakti of the spirit, and the amount of shakti that=
 those trying to help are able to generate in order to remove the spirit.Mo=
reover, if the spirit of a violent and extremely malevolent nature, then un=
less the person trying to remove it is an adept in this, he/she may come to=
 serious harm.<br><br>These things like removing possession are specializat=
ions. These do not fall under the ambit of normal sadhana. Unless one knows=
 well what one is getting into, any sadhaka with even basic common sense wo=
uld do best to stay away. Every action has its repercussion and one must kn=
ow well how to handle the same too. Again
 if a spirit is removed by force =
before the time till which, based on previous karma, it was supposed to be =
in possession of the individual, then that too starts a new karmic chain wh=
ich will involve some not so pleasant consequences for the person who tried=
 to remove the spirit. It is all a complex chain.<br><br>[Reminds me of a p=
articular individual I knew some years ago who was an expert in exorcism. B=
ut before starting any exorcism he would ask his Guides to tell him about t=
he spirit as well as the time frame for which the spirit would stay in poss=
ession as per the previous karmic link between the spirit and the victim. T=
hen he would sit and do rituals daily to entice the spirit to leave the bod=
y of its own free will, promising good deeds for the spirit in return. Neve=
r trying to remove it by force. Most cases it would work. Rare cases where =
the spirit is of a very violent nature, force had to be applied.]<br><br>Be=
st thing to do is a) find someone
 who knows exactly how to deal with spiri=
t possession and hope for the best. b) In the event the first is not possib=
le, ask family members to pick sadhana/mantra of any deity - preferably Bha=
irava, Kali, Chandi, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are b=
etter) - and do it with samkalpa with sufficient force and will and time. W=
hich means, a 10-20 mins path of hanuman chalisa may not help. Depends on t=
he degree of possession. Someone may have to spend 3-5 hours daily with any=
 sadhana with the mental belief/faith/will/determination to see this throug=
h to the very end. While doing the sadhana keep a bowl of water in a copper=
 pot, and then either make the possessed individual drink the water or spri=
nkle it on him/her. And pray as hard as possible. <br><br>Best of luck and =
may God help the family.<br><br>-Regards<br> Rajarshi<br><br><br><div>=

What a=

mantras at night before going to sleep?<br>
