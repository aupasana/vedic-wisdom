Namaste,

I am glad to=
 know that. With practice, it will become smooth and you can 
start to focu=
s better of mantra.

When priests perform homam on a grand scale, they dist=
ribute the tasks among 
them. If you do on a smaller scale by yourself, you=
 can do everything by 
yourself. In fact, the latter is better.

In fact, e=
ven when many priests do it together with one fire, it is good to 
have one=
 person managing the fire and offerings. If one chants, one prepares 
and c=
hooses offerings and one finally makes the offerings in the fire, that 
is =
better than everybody making different offerings in fire. Ideally, the 
con=
tact with fire should be from one person. Of course, if each has a 
separat=
e homa kundam, all can make offerings in fire.

Never think in terms of kee=
ping the positive vibrations to yourself or 
within your house. Fire is the=
 basis of creation. Fire rituals are important 
to maintain dharma in this =
universe and promote creation and sustenance. Do 
homam thinking that you a=
re doing your dharma and have no other thoughts of 
motives. Of course, if =
you do your dharma by helping nature, nature WILL 
reward you for it. But l=
eave it to nature and do your part selflessly. 
Self-centeredness is an aci=
d of which a single drop is sufficient to break 
the milk of your ritual.

=
Actually, a homam done under the sky (i.e. in open air) is better than one =

done under a roof (i.e. inside a house). However, when one cannot do in op=
en 
air, one can do inside a house also.

Best regards,
Narasimha
