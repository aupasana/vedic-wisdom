Namaste Narasimha ji,

The two great takeaways that i cherish from your mes=
sages are:

"The bottomline is: Keep doing enough sadhana to burn the condi=
tioning and keep making progress."

"If one's spiritual sadhana and remedie=
s are not working, it is unlikely to be due to technical imperfections. It =
is likely due to lack of a perfect surrender and humility."

Thank you!
