Namaste friends,
 
A brief manual for Chandi homam is now available at
 
ht=
tp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam/chandi.htm
 
It builds upon Mahaganapath=
i homam manual and gives incremental/differential directions for Chandi hom=
am. Mahaganapathi homam manual can be downloaded at
 
http://www.VedicAstro=
loger.org/homam/ganapathi.htm
 
Some words of caution regarding Chandi homa=
m are reproduced from the manual at the end of this mail. While Mahaganapat=
hi homam is appropriate for all, Chandi homam is a bigger commitment and ap=
propriate for some. Those who are interested may take advantage of this doc=
ument.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

Word of Caution
 
Chandi is a very fierce an=
d powerful deity - She is the primordial energy that is responsible for the=
 creation, sustenance and destruction of this entire universe. She is the s=
um total of the energies of all beings of this universe. Chandi homam is un=
questionably a very powerful sadhana.
 
This ritual can be used for getting=
 wealth and health, for success in various wordly matters and for destroyin=
g enemies. However, one performing Chandi homam for such a specific purpose=
 needs to meet some exacting demands, such as perfect pronunciation, perfec=
t procedure and perfect materials for the purpose, and have some accumulate=
d spiritual energy to pull off the feat.
 
Neither is the author an expert =
in performing homam with such an attitude nor does he teach that. This docu=
ment is strictly for one who performs Chandi homam for spiritual upliftment=
 and looks at the Divine Mother as a mother and looks at oneself as a helpl=
ess child who desperately wants to improve. This document is strictly for o=
ne who is willing to undergo whatever one's mother wants one to undergo, fo=
r the sake of spiritual upliftment. 
 
However, it is not necessary that Sh=
e should take away one's material success and prosperity in order to give s=
piritual upliftment. In fact, many people who perform Chandi homam everyday=
 or every week using this document may experience continued or even increas=
ed material success (and yet be able to remain detached from it and progres=
s spiritually). However, in some cases, She may decide to give a shock or t=
wo in worldly matters if something is badly blocking one's spiritual progre=
ss and a setback is needed. The path towards self-realization is different =
for each person. She knows the best for each person. Unless one is willing =
to surrender to Her completely and accept whatever comes one's way - good o=
r bad - as Her blessings and unless one does not expect any specific materi=
al benefit from this homam, one should not use this document to perform Cha=
ndi homam.
 
Again, as emphasized in the Mahaganapathi homam manual, regula=
rity is the key. Performing a homam once in a while is insufficient. One sh=
ould repeat the sadhana daily or weekly. If one performs Chandi homam once =
everyday, it is almost sure to transform one's attitude and outlook and put=
 one's spiritual evolution on the fast track.
