Dear Narsimhaji,
I have joined this group for last one year. I have read yo=
ur valuable articles on this site. I also knew that you are the lover and f=
ollower of Shri Shri Thakur. This was the reason I wrote this mail on Thaku=
r. I have narrated this incident to very few people who are loving Thakur a=
nd when I told this incident they all were weeping. But I am sorry that you=
r mail disappointed me. You have given analysis of this incident on intelle=
ctual level or it=C2=A0was more logical and less devotional. I was expectin=
g the excitement in your mail but you just justified that it is possible as=
 our faith is working...!!!
Dear Sir, for your information I would write th=
at when this incident happened I was not knowing Thakur, nor was any devoti=
on towards Him. It was due to Mr. Patel I had just taken the decision to ac=
cept HIM as my Guru. I was also upset in the morning after discussion with =
my wife and started thinking that my decision was hasty. I just taken a cha=
nce as I was told by Mr. Patel that you can test Thakur before you accept h=
im as your Guru. I remembered his words that morning and told my wife that =
if my decision is right, Mr. Patel should come to my house. I was not knowi=
ng then actually Mr. Patel will come to my place within 10 minutes and Thak=
ur will show him the way to my home. 
You have written that Thakur might ha=
ve taken rebirth after 100 years. I think=C2=A0this was his desire and not =
necessary he is already born now.It is His will to take 100 years or 150 ye=
ars for re-birth. I am now strongly believe that Thakur is still alive on e=
arth because my another incidents are also leading me to believe that He is=
 coming to this earth. Mr. Patel was experiencing him very offen. 
It was a=
 miracle and whenever I remember this day I am excited. I am not his staunc=
h devotee even today but still He is with me, He loves me rather. Oh, what =
to say !

Dear Ashwin ji,
=C2=A0
It is a very interesting epis=
ode you have narrated! Thank you for sharing it.
=C2=A0
After Ramakrishna l=
eft his body, several people saw him in embodied form.
=C2=A0
That is entir=
ely possible. When someone who did not identify with a body but identified =
with the entire universe lives in a body and leaves, it is not like he has =
left. He is still there, in every atom and in everything. If someone is att=
ached to him with that body of his and he has compassion for that person, h=
e *can* give darshan to that person in that body. It is not that he is "ali=
ve" or "dead". It is just that he is in every atom or sub-atomic particle o=
f this creation because he has realized the true nature of Self while livin=
g in the previous body and that realization was intact even while leaving t=
hat body.
=C2=A0
According to Sarada Mata, Ramakrishna told her and Lakshmi=
 that he would be back after 100 years and that all of them would have to b=
e reborn when he is reborn after 100 years. Thus, he may have already come =
to earth in a different body. But that does not matter. Those who have an a=
ttachment to Ramakrishna and stuck at the lower level form may still be abl=
e to access his previous form.
=C2=A0
Even after the form of Rama left this=
=C2=A0world and the form of=C2=A0Krishna was born, a devotee of Rama who do=
es great tapascharya for Rama may be able to realize a darshan of the form =
of Rama.
=C2=A0
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was almost certainly an avatara.
=
=C2=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

=C2=A0




Dear Sir, I would like to share one of my gre=
at Devine experience about shri Ramkrishnadev. This is an unbelievable expe=
rience that I have had. I have not added anything from my own. I am writing=
 exactly as was happened in my life. I am going back to the period of 1973/=
74. Kindly read this only when you are in religious mood. 

=C2=A0 

I was =
working as telegraphist at Okha Port Post office near Dwarka. My duty was f=
rom 7 am to 7 pm and I was getting late fee allowance for extra duty. There=
 was a Telephone exchange just opposite to Post office and due to same Dep=
=E2=80=99t; I had friendship with some Telephone operators. One Mr. Ramanbh=
ai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel) was working as Operator. He was a=
 staunch devotee of=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 shri Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was me=
eting him he was always talking about shri Thakur. We came close day by day=
. There was a weekly gathering at his home called SATSANGA. He was singing =
devotional songs created by him and was weeping while singing. He was readi=
ng Ramkrishna Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending this weekly=
 meeting on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of 30 =
then. We were used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after duty hours and wer=
e talking only about Thakur. 

One day when we were at sea shore he suddenl=
y told me--=E2=80=9CRawalbhai, some guest have come to my home and my wife =
is remembering me. My son will come in a few minutes to call me. I shall ha=
ve to go now=E2=80=9D. -- And with my surprise his 8 years old son came to =
call him. 

At one another incident he told me that there will be a plane c=
rash tomorrow and that also happened. I was very much impressed about him. =
He could foresee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus, he told =
me not to go through bus, as bus tire will be punctured. Yet I went to Bus =
station but bus did not come from Dwarka as was punctured on the way. This =
was surprising. 

This all incidents made me to believe that he had some su=
per power and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was attracted t=
o shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also be disciple of shri Thakur =
and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered myself to Thakur a=
t Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s house before Thakur picture. I prayed him deeply from=
 my heart to accept me as his follower and bestow his grace. 

Next day mor=
ning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 morning while taking the tea. =
As my duty was to start from 7 am I was waking up at 5.45 morning. I told t=
o my wife in the morning that I have accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Guru=
dev. My wife was annoyed and she argued with me a lot. =E2=80=94=E2=80=9CWh=
y should you take such a hasty decision? Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devote=
e of Maa Kali at Calcutta. He was a great Saint but our Guru should be livi=
ng one, who can guide us, give us Mantra etc. etc. Better you take Dixa fro=
m Shri Ram Sharma Acharya since you are doing Gayatri Mantra=E2=80=9D--. 

=
Her arguments were right at her place as people in general not know much ab=
out Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I have taken hasty decision.=
 I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. -- 

But I remember that Mr. Patel ha=
d told me that Thakur was telling their disciples to test him before accept=
ing him. I also decided to test Thakur. I immediately told my wife that =E2=
=80=93=E2=80=9CSee, Mr. Patel has never come to our home. You have also not=
 seen him. He has never asked me where I am living. Suppose Mr. Patel is co=
ming to our house within 10 to 15 minutes, would you believe that my select=
ion for Thakur is perfect?=E2=80=9D-- 

She laughed at me=E2=80=94=E2=80=9C=
How it is possible? I don=E2=80=99t believe.=E2=80=9D-- 

I prayed Shri Tha=
kur to send Mr. Patel immediately to justify my decision and convince my wi=
fe. =E2=80=98I want to test your existence even today.=E2=80=99 

To our gr=
eat surprise, Mr. Patel was at my home at 06.30 in the morning with angry m=
ood. What he told? 

=E2=80=98 How dare you test Thakur this way? Do you kn=
ow what happened? Yesterday was my night duty and I had just come to my hom=
e at 05.30 mornings today and tried to sleep for 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly Tha=
kur pulled my blanket and told me that-=E2=80=9C Go to your friend=E2=80=99=
s house. He is waiting for you. He wants to test me. I will show you his ho=
use=E2=80=9D 

I immediately rushed to your home. Thakur was guiding me the=
 way to your house and pushing me too. What you want? Why you are disturbin=
g him in such an early morning for such a silly things?=E2=80=99 

We both =
were so excited and surprised that we had no words that Morning. 

I will n=
ever forget that 5th April, a miracle day in my life. There were some more =
Devine experiences about Shri Thakur but I will write it sometime. 

Dear S=
ir, and forum members, Ramkrishandev is still alive on the earth. This is a=
 fact I have written and no word is added to exaggerate.=C2=A0 May Shri Tha=
kur bless all of us. 

Dr. Ashwin Rawal Ahmedabad
