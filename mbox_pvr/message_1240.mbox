Namaste,
 
Deities are accompanied by various celestial beings. For example=
, the divine Mother has several attendants (e.g. Jaya, Vijaya, Jayanti, Apa=
rajita etc).
 
According to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Sarada Mata was born w=
ith an amsa of Bagalamukhi and some of his sishyas like Yogin Ma, Golap Ma =
etc were born with an amsa of Jaya, Vijaya etc. They took care of Sarada Ma=
ta. These celestial attendants are born as human beings when god is born as=
 a human being.
 
As one's sadhana for a deity progresses, that deity's att=
endants may visit one in celestial form (one may or may not realize it).
 
=
However, one should not think of all these things. It is ok to be aware of =
the possibilities and, if a result occurs, it is ok to take cognisance of i=
t. But, expecting and looking forward to a result corrupts the sadhana. The=
 sadhana one engages in should be an offering to god without anything *expe=
cted* in return. Such sadhana begets the highest fruits.
 
Moreover, whethe=
r one was visited by a deity's attendants or not is not really a measure of=
 one's progress. One's progress is judged from the internal transformation.=
 When someone praises you (correctly or incorrectly, does not matter), does=
 it make you proud? Of course, one may act humble externally and yet feel p=
roud internally. I am talking about the internal feelings here. Similarly, =
when someone criticizes you (correctly or incorrectly, does not matter), do=
es it make you unhappy or angry? One may not show it externally and yet fee=
l those emotions internally. I am talking about the internal feelings here.=
 Spiritual sadhana is about overcoming internal enemies and weaknesses and =
reaching the state of sthita prajnataa. Anything else that happens external=
ly is secondary and a coincidence.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

          Na=
maste,

          Orthodox tradition is rooted in meaningful principles tha=
t got overstretched in time.

          Several ethereal beings are sensiti=
ve to smell and many of them do not like the smell of menstrual blood and a=
lso the aura of normal women in periods (if it is a spiritually elevated wo=
man, it is different). Though most higher deities do not care about this, t=
heir attendants may be sensitive. When you do a sadhana, an attendant of a =
deity may visit at first. One can try to make the visitors comfortable.

  =
        However, there may be so many other offensive things where we do sa=
dhana these days and putting too much stress on one little thing is somewha=
t unbalanced. You can try to follow tradition if that is possible. Otherwis=
e, don't worry.

          Regarding cooking food, the food we eat now-a-da=
ys is so badly corrupted in various ways that being cooked by a lady with p=
eriods is a very small thing in comparison. Coming into the pooja room is a=
lso not a big deal in my view.

          However, when you do homam, I sug=
gest not using food cooked by such a lady if possible. Also I suggest that =
ladies with periods should not come too close to the fire. These are precau=
tionary suggestions only.

          Chandipath is fine. The Mother does no=
t care much about external things.

          Best regards,
          Naras=
imha
