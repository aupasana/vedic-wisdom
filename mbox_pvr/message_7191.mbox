      Namaste,



Someone asked me how to=
 explain a kid why there are many gods in 

Hinduism while some religions h=
ave a single god. I will share some 

thoughts.



*        *        *



W=
hen one is thirsty, one can drink water (H2O) to get some energy. From 

th=
e same water, we can also make different mineral waters, vitamin 

waters, =
flavored waters, soft drinks of various kinds etc and drink them 

instead =
of water.



Hindu scriptures say that there is only god (Brahman or Aatman=
 or Self), 

but that god manifests as different devatas (deities) with var=
ious 

natures, qualities and energies.



The one god - Brahman or Allah o=
r Holy Spirit - has no qualities (like 

form, color, shape, nature etc) an=
d is beyond description and the source 

of all deities. Similarly, plain w=
ater - which is the source of all 

other drinks - has no taste or smell or=
 flavor. Deities arising from 

that one god have various qualities (gentle=
, fierce etc). Similarly, 

many kinds of flavored water and soft drinks ha=
ve different taste, smell 

and flavor. Just as one can drink whatever drin=
k one likes, based on 

one's taste, to quench thirst, similarly one can wo=
rship whatever deity 

one likes, based on one's taste, to quench the inner=
 thirst of one's 

soul and give it energy to do its work.



*        *   =
     *



Just as Abraham said no to the worship of idols and forms and ins=
talled 

the notion of one god, one can ban flavored drinks and say that on=
ly 

plain water can be drunk. That is not wrong, but most people find wate=
r 

too plain and prefer different drinks. Similarly, most people cannot 

=
relate to ONE formless (i.e. beyond forms) god and using specific forms 

b=
ased on one's mental state helps improve devotion.



*        *        *

=


Just as different people may call water with different names (water, 

pa=
ani, jalam, tanni, neellu, acqua, wasser etc), similarly different 

people=
 may call the one god as Brahman or Parabrahma or Aatman or Buddha 

or Sel=
f or Allah or Ahora Mazda or Holy Spirit or whatever. There's 

nothing in =
a name. Fighting that Allah is superior or Brahman, is akin 

to fighting t=
hat paani is superior to jalam!



When you have water or a drink, the key =
is to drink it and get energy. 

If one stores it, flaunts it and looks at =
now and then, it won't quench 

thirst. Similarly, keeping a god's idol or =
picture or a scripture or 

reading it now, it won't quench the inner thirs=
t. One needs to think of 

god in mind, contemplate on the nature of god an=
d get some of that 

nature within oneself through resonance. That gives en=
ergy and 

transforms one.



*        *        *



>From the "Fire Yoga" g=
uide (http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/fire):



People have the notion that =
there are different gods who created 

different people. But the fact is th=
at one god created this whole 

universe and god is beyond forms, beyond kn=
owing, beyond understanding 

and beyond describing. People who have experi=
enced different aspects of 

this one god have given different names and de=
scriptions and different 

paths to reach god.



Despite the existence of =
many religions and many notions of god today, 

one thing we can declare co=
nfidently is that god is one and all 

religions are different attempts to =
reach that one god or cosmic 

consciousness. Infinite god cannot be captur=
ed completely by anything 

finite, including religion. God can be realized=
 only though internal 

experience and not through reading books or intelle=
ctual discussions or 

hearing about someone else=E2=80=99s description of =
god.



*        *        *



Happy Ganesha Chaturthi to all of you!

Narasimha
