Namaste Sir,
 
The literal meaning of kavacha is a protective cover/shield.=
 Kavachas of planets and gods are typically used for physical well-being, p=
rotection and removal of disease. If you follow the meanings of most kavach=
as, you are asking the planet or god in question for the protection of vari=
ous body parts.
 
Two very powerful and comprehensive kavachas are Narayana=
 kavacham from SrimadBhagavatam and Chandi Kavacham from Varaha Puranam.
 
=
It is a useful exercise to compare Vishnu kavacham with Narayana kavacham t=
o understand the difference between Vishnu and Narayana.
 
If someone picks=
 any kavacham and spends a couple of hours everyday chanting it many times =
over and keeps that habit for a few years, an invisible shield is formed ar=
ound one's subtle body and protects one always. Kavachas are very powerful.=

 
But some people these days have little time to devote to God and want re=
sults in 5-10 minutes. That is tough.
 
That is my quick 2 cents and I hope=
 other learned scholars give more detailed and comprehensive answers.
 
Bes=
t regards,
Narasimha
