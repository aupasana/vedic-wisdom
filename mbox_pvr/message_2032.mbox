Jai Santoshi Ma,
=C2=A0
This is a compelling thread. But, to me, the most i=
ntriguing aspect of Vimalananda's assertion that the rishis created the god=
s is "how" he could say it. The answer seems to be that he could say anythi=
ng, in that he was protected by Smashan Tara. Vimalananda, if he existed, c=
ame very close to living in a state beyond fear, and in a constant state of=
 ecstasy, having removed bodily suffering by directly challenging it. The s=
exual excitement of suffering, call it kundalini or whatever, seemed to be =
the key to this passion for life. The mind, the rishis, the Godhead are all=
 ultimately the play of shakti. The Yakshini who follows him and says "Mai =
Aaun" is his ego's own projection of a limited shakti, the temptation or pl=
ay of his own mind, which threatens destruction. The yakshini is his own do=
ubt about the mother, and he can't live with this doubt, the fear that the =
mother will harm him. He had to ask one of his gurus to finally take the ya=
kshini away
 because he didn't want to be bothered and he didn't believe he=
 had the power to remove her himself. Vimalananda had such devotion to the =
mother that he did not have to fear, because he knew that he would return t=
o the mother and that all of this earthly life was mere play. When he goes =
to the smashan and leaves his new wife in the car, she gets scared and pass=
es out because of the miracle of union with shakti that Vimalananda has ach=
ieved. When the male does not resist the feminine force, there are no more =
egoic demons for Kali to destroy. She passes out, unconscious. At that poin=
t, Vimalananda was at the top of his game. He was beyond fear. It is only i=
n moments of weakness that Shiva would need Vishnu or vice versa, moments o=
f fatigue, like passing the baton in a race or tag teaming in wrestling: th=
e duality of on/off. The rishi's mind cannot sustain any one state, so he c=
reates many gods. He can't abide in shakti all the time, so he manifests hi=
s own
 ego as Vishnu or Shiva in order to preserve or destroy manifestation=
s of shakti, thoughts of his own mind which either please or disturb him. T=
he myth of the ever burning light, (like Byron the Bulb in "Gravity's Rainb=
ow") is an example of the unattainable. It is the shakti which the rishi kn=
ows is there only when he thinks about it, but he cannot think about it or =
experience it all the time. If he could tune all chakras to this shakti at =
all times that would be perfect tantra. He must, however, create the manife=
station of shakti, or the mother, to rescue him from any type of mental or =
physical difficulty, or backwater of consciousness which he encounters. The=
 Yakshini is only his death if he needs death, but his mother if he needs l=
ife. If he can't take the backwater anymore he will sacrifice his sexual en=
ergy to the yakshini and have done with life. But if he sees her as mother =
he will live. Ultimately he would like to see her as Shiva saw Parvati. If
=
 he can hold this latter state he has reached perfect tantra.

The non-dual Aatman or Brahman is the original source =

Please=

=C2=A0
The duality is =
so vast and yet non-duality is the underlying supreme reality in duality. T=
hus, the hierarchy within hierarchy will have to start at the connection wi=
th non-duality and it is not one. In other words, any hierarchy given by an=

There is no causal relationship betw=

Our ego does not leave us even in sadhana. Sometimes, =
one's belief that one's guru is the best guru or the god one prays to is th=
e supreme one is rooted in one'e ego and one's need to be the best and be a=
ssociated with the best. Just contemplate if that is the case and if it is,=
 try to root out such thinking.
=C2=A0
Having said that, do look at the god=
 you pray to as the supreme and try to reach the supreme through him/her by=
 surrendering to him/her. If you take a low level manifestation of that dei=
ty, then rishis may indeed be beyond him/her as Vimalananda said. But, if y=

I have a question. Though it will probably sound stupid to a =

What confuses me is that, what can be higher than a deity? For examp=

As a devotee it is natural =

Aurobindo need not be talking about a single "savior" the way=
 people may imagine. Also, he need not be talking about somebody "connected=
 to" his ashram. Moreover, when it comes to great lineages, there are conne=
ctions between all. For example, Aurobindo used to visit the house of Siste=
r Nivedita, the foremost disciple of Swami Vivekananda and knew her well wh=
en he still lived in Calcutta. He had a vision in his prison cell of Swami =
Vivekananda, just=C2=A0a few years after his death, in which he imparted Au=
robindo some key knowledge. Paramahamsa Yogananda grew up in Calcutta and l=
earnt Sanskrit from M, who was a sishya of Ramakrishna and wrote the gospel=
 of Ramakrishna. Trilinga Swami sent a tantra teacher to Ramakrishna to exp=
and his knowledge. Trilinga Swami knew Lahiri mahashaya and admired him. An=
d so on.
=C2=A0
Coming back to the main point, the supermind established in=
 the field of earth that was referred to by Aurobindo can simply be a mahar=
shi paying some attention to matters on earth. A maharshi absorbed in the d=
ivine in one of the higher planes of consciousness can accomplish huge chan=
ges on earth by the mere power of his thought. If there is a divine play to=
 make some positive changes on earth and a maharshi takes part in the play,=
 he may focus a small part of his supermind on the affairs of earth and dir=
ect a few important souls to do some key work.=C2=A0Some important souls (d=
eities, rishis or yogis etc) may send their amshas (partial essence) to be =
born on earth to fulfil different parts of a divine play.
=C2=A0
You may th=
en see several (not just one) elevated beings, enlightened beings and reali=
zed beings born on earth to bring clarity in different aspects of spiritual=
 knowledge. Each of them will get specific internal/external guidance from =
the divine, based on what their part in the play is.

The "Asura of Falsehood" that Aurobindo alluded to is all around =
us. At the subtlest level, he manifests as false ego in pretty much everybo=

One should not tolerate this Asura (demon) and fight hard. =

I know very little. But I was told that an age that is somewhat like the by=
gone ages will be established on earth for a few hundred years in the comin=

Namaste
=C2=A0
I fo=
und an interesting article based on Sri Aurobindo's writing. I am posting i=
t here for anyone interested.
=C2=A0
Near the beginning of the 20th century=
 the great Indian freedom fighter and yogi-sage, Sri Aurobindo, began to ex=
press a truth which had not been expressed before. In his high states of di=
vine union he saw that the time had come for a new stage in the evolution o=
f mankind. He saw that the divine was to manifest right here on Earth and t=
hat the time for this divine emergence into Earth life was now. He spoke of=
 heaven descending to Earth, even as Earth experienced a breakdown due to t=
he intrinsic resistance held within her material body towards this =EF=BF=
=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD
=EF=BF=BD
Sri Aurobindo was joined in Pondicherry, Ind=
ia, by a French mystic, Mirra Alfassa, who later became known as the Mother=
. Together they embarked on a journey of intensive cellular transformation =
that is very relevant to the colossal uncertainties we face today.
=EF=BF=
=BD
Sri Aurobindo saw that the divine force permeates all matter, and that =
all matter therefore has a force of consciousness. The process of the divin=
e spirit descending down into matter is called involution. The process by w=
hich the divine ascends back upwards out of matter is called evolution. Acc=
ording to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a stage where these two event=
s are occurring simultaneously, and in his inner visions, he foresaw that w=
e would soon be experiencing a descent of what he called =EF=BF=BDsuprament=
al (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=BD that would entirely change everythin=
g on Earth.
=EF=BF=BD
Man=EF=BF=BDs greatness is not in what he is, says Sr=
i Aurobindo, but in what he makes possible. An immortal soul is somewhere w=
ithin him, even if seldom active in most people, while an eternal spirit ov=
ershadows him, even if obstructed from descent by the hard lid of his const=
ructed personality. There is a great divine plan in motion, even if the evi=
dence of the outer senses seems to contradict it.

Sri Aurobindo recognized=
 that humankind is going through an evolutionary crisis. A stage has been r=
eached in which the human mind has made tremendous strides on the one hand,=
 but is left hopelessly inadequate to prevent its own extinction as a speci=
es. Meanwhile, as the Mother testified before her death in 1973, a consciou=
sness higher than the human rational mind, what may be termed the Supermind=
, has recently been established in the fields of the Earth, and is active t=
here. Our task now is to bring it down into cellular consciousness.

Evolut=
ion took a great leap forward with the origins of Life, and later with the =
emergence of Mind. We are now at the threshold of another leap forward, eve=
n more momentous, as we prepare for the emergence of the Supermind. Sri Aur=
obindo speaks about four stages of human evolution, which we will soon be s=
tarting to experience concurrently upon Earth. The first is =EF=BF=BDanimal=
 human,=EF=BF=BD our current species, a rational being possessing an indivi=
dualized soul, but largely obstructed from contacting and merging with it.
=
=EF=BF=BD
Next is the =EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a species that is spon=
taneous- ly coming to birth under the influence of an ever-expanding supram=
ental field, a being that is largely able to merge and live from soul-consc=
iousness rather than mind-consciousness. 
=C2=A0
Thirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOv=
erman,=EF=BF=BD who will still inhabit a dense physical body, but will be i=
n possession of the Mind of Light, which is supramental consciousness that =
has begun to merge with cellular consciousness. 
=C2=A0
Finally, our ultima=
te goal as a species is the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity i=
ncarnated fully within the subtle realms of matter. This will be a race of =
what we could call =EF=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In this species, th=
e unity of matter and spirit would be fully realized upon Earth.

The great=
 work of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was in bringing supramental conscious=
ness down into the cellular consciousness of their own bodies. Since this i=
s a unified consciousness, this meant that the supramental consciousness wa=
s simultaneously being brought into the consciousness fields of the Earth, =
awaiting the moment when it would flower into its full manifestation in col=
lective matter.
Whenever there is a =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is corr=
esponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo and the Mother speak of their experienc=
e with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD essentially anti-divine forces, a=
t work in the world today. There is the Asura of Darkness, the Asura of Suf=
fering, The Asura of Falsehood, and the Asura of Death. These are the force=
s that are so outwardly apparent, and which seem to be in control of curren=
t global events. According to them the Asura of Darkness (Lucifer?) has gon=
e through a transformation recently, and the Asura of Suffering has returne=
d to Source, and so only the latter two still remain to wreak havoc on Eart=
h. Interestingly, they spoke of the Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=
=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during World War II, and of their own intensive in=
ner work in countering his influence. It would not be difficult to see how =
this same Asura may be influencing other world leaders in the current polit=
ical sphere.

With the descent of this new vibratory consciousness all our =
old obsolete human structures will be demolished. However, Sri Aurobindo em=
phasized that although the changes will be enormous they would not be neces=
sarily catastrophic. The power of Truth automatically erases Falsehood, and=
 our world for the most part consists of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, h=
e maintained, carried a power of harmonization which could overcome this re=
sistance by means other than dramatic struggle and violence. The Asuras wil=
l eventually be absorbed into their original emanations of Light, Life, Bea=
uty, and Truth. It may be interesting to speculate, with all the violence i=
n the world today, the destruction we might have experienced if not for thi=
s power of harmonization!

When does all this happen? Sri Aurobindo and the=
 Mother believed that the world stage was set for this quantum descent, and=
 that it was quite imminent. The Mother said in 1968 that the supramental t=
ransformation was a certainty now, and that it would come about with a mini=
mum of destruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough this minimum is still considerable.=
=EF=BF=BD She said that the year 2000 would be a turning point.
=C2=A0
This=
 was a very interesting read and matches what Narasimhaji says about change=
s coming in the world.

<DIV>This is a compelling thread. But, to me, the most intriguing aspect o=
f Vimalananda's assertion that the rishis created the gods is "how" he coul=
d say it. The answer seems to be that he could say anything, in that he was=
 protected by Smashan Tara. Vimalananda, if he existed, came very close to =
living in a state beyond fear, and in a constant state of ecstasy, having r=
emoved bodily suffering by directly challenging it. The sexual excitement o=
f suffering, call it kundalini or whatever, seemed to be the key to this pa=
ssion for life. The mind, the rishis, the Godhead are all ultimately the pl=
ay of shakti. The Yakshini who follows him and says "Mai Aaun" is his ego's=
 own projection of a limited shakti, the temptation or play of his own mind=
, which threatens destruction. The yakshini is his own doubt about the moth=
er, and he can't live with this doubt, the fear that the mother will harm h=
im. He had to ask one of his gurus to finally take the yakshini away
 becau=
se he didn't want to be bothered and he didn't believe he had the power to =
remove her himself. Vimalananda had such devotion to the mother that he did=
 not have to fear, because he knew that he would return to the mother and t=
hat all of this earthly life was mere play. When he goes to the smashan and=
 leaves his new wife in the car, she gets scared and passes out because of =
the miracle of union with shakti that Vimalananda has achieved. When the ma=
le does not resist the feminine force, there are no more egoic demons for K=
ali to destroy. She passes out, unconscious. At that point, Vimalananda was=
 at the top of his game. He was beyond fear. It is only in moments of weakn=
ess that Shiva would need Vishnu or vice versa, moments of fatigue, like pa=
ssing the baton in a race or tag teaming in wrestling: the duality of on/of=
f. The rishi's mind cannot sustain any one state, so he creates many gods. =
He can't abide in shakti all the time, so he manifests his own
 ego as Vish=
nu or Shiva in order to preserve or destroy manifestations of shakti, thoug=
hts of his own mind which either please or disturb him. The myth of the eve=
r burning light, (like Byron the Bulb in "Gravity's Rainbow") is an example=
 of the unattainable. It is the shakti which the rishi knows is there only =
when he thinks about it, but he cannot think about it or experience it all =
the time. If he could tune all chakras to this shakti at all times that wou=
ld be perfect tantra. He must, however, create the manifestation of shakti,=
 or the mother, to rescue him from any type of mental or physical difficult=
y, or backwater of consciousness which he encounters. The Yakshini is only =
his death if he needs death, but his mother if he needs life. If he can't t=
ake the backwater anymore he will sacrifice his sexual energy to the yakshi=
ni and have done with life. But if he sees her as mother he will live. Ulti=
mately he would like to see her as Shiva saw Parvati. If
 he can hold this =
latter state he has reached perfect tantra.</DIV>

<DIV>I found an interesting article based on Sri Aurobindo=
's writing. I am posting it here for anyone interested.</DIV>
<DIV><FONT fa=
ce=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>Near the beginning of the 20th=
 century the great Indian freedom fighter and yogi-sage, Sri Aurobindo, beg=
an to express a truth which had not been expressed before. In his high stat=
es of divine union he saw that the time had come for a new stage in the evo=
lution of mankind. He saw that the divine was to manifest right here on Ear=
th and that the time for this divine emergence into Earth life was now. He =
spoke of heaven descending to Earth, even as Earth experienced a breakdown =
due to the intrinsic resistance held within her material body towards this =
=EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD<BR>=EF=BF=BD<BR>Sri Aurobindo was joined in Pond=
icherry, India, by a French mystic, Mirra Alfassa, who later became known a=
s the Mother. Together they embarked on a journey of intensive cellular tra=
nsformation that is very relevant to the colossal uncertainties we face tod=
ay.<BR>=EF=BF=BD<BR>Sri Aurobindo saw that the divine force permeates all m=
atter, and that all matter therefore has a force of
 consciousness. The pro=
cess of the divine spirit descending down into matter is called involution.=
 The process by which the divine ascends back upwards out of matter is call=
ed evolution. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a stage wher=
e these two events are occurring simultaneously, and in his inner visions, =
he foresaw that we would soon be experiencing a descent of what he called =
=EF=BF=BDsupramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=BD that would entirel=
y change everything on Earth.<BR>=EF=BF=BD<BR>Man=EF=BF=BDs greatness is no=
t in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in what he makes possible. An immo=
rtal soul is somewhere within him, even if seldom active in most people, wh=
ile an eternal spirit overshadows him, even if obstructed from descent by t=
he hard lid of his constructed personality. There is a great divine plan in=
 motion, even if the evidence of the outer senses seems to contradict it.</=
DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></=
FONT><BR>Sri Aurobindo recognized that humankind is going through an evolut=
ionary crisis. A stage has been reached in which the human mind has made tr=
emendous strides on the one hand, but is left hopelessly inadequate to prev=
ent its own extinction as a species. Meanwhile, as the Mother testified bef=
ore her death in 1973, a consciousness higher than the human rational mind,=
 what may be termed the Supermind, has recently been established in the fie=
lds of the Earth, and is active there. Our task now is to bring it down int=
o cellular consciousness.<BR></DIV>
<DIV>Evolution took a great leap forwar=
d with the origins of Life, and later with the emergence of Mind. We are no=
w at the threshold of another leap forward, even more momentous, as we prep=
are for the emergence of the Supermind. Sri Aurobindo speaks about four sta=
ges of human evolution, which we will soon be starting to experience concur=
rently upon Earth. The first is =EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current=
 species, a rational being possessing an individualized soul, but largely o=
bstructed from contacting and merging with it.<BR>=EF=BF=BD<BR>Next is the =
=EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a species that is spontaneous- ly coming to =
birth under the influence of an ever-expanding supramental field, a being t=
hat is largely able to merge and live from soul-consciousness rather than m=
ind-consciousness. </DIV>

<DIV>Thirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still inhabit a=
 dense physical body, but will be in possession of the Mind of Light, which=
 is supramental consciousness that has begun to merge with cellular conscio=
usness. </DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV>Fi=
nally, our ultimate goal as a species is the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=
=BF=BD divinity incarnated fully within the subtle realms of matter. This w=
ill be a race of what we could call =EF=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In=
 this species, the unity of matter and spirit would be fully realized upon =
Earth.<BR></DIV>
<DIV>The great work of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was in=
 bringing supramental consciousness down into the cellular consciousness of=
 their own bodies. Since this is a unified consciousness, this meant that t=
he supramental consciousness was simultaneously being brought into the cons=
ciousness fields of the Earth, awaiting the moment when it would flower int=
o its full manifestation in collective matter.<BR>Whenever there is a =EF=
=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is corresponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo and=
 the Mother speak of their experience with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=
=BD essentially anti-divine forces, at work in the world today. There is th=
e Asura of Darkness, the Asura of Suffering, The Asura of Falsehood, and th=
e Asura of Death. These are the forces that are so outwardly apparent, and =
which seem to be in control of current global events. According to them the=
 Asura of Darkness (Lucifer?) has gone through a transformation recently, a=
nd the Asura of Suffering has
 returned to Source, and so only the latter t=
wo still remain to wreak havoc on Earth. Interestingly, they spoke of the A=
sura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during World =
War II, and of their own intensive inner work in countering his influence. =
It would not be difficult to see how this same Asura may be influencing oth=
er world leaders in the current political sphere.<BR></DIV>
<DIV>With the d=
escent of this new vibratory consciousness all our old obsolete human struc=
tures will be demolished. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that although t=
he changes will be enormous they would not be necessarily catastrophic. The=
 power of Truth automatically erases Falsehood, and our world for the most =
part consists of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, he maintained, carried a =
power of harmonization which could overcome this resistance by means other =
than dramatic struggle and violence. The Asuras will eventually be absorbed=
 into their original emanations of Light, Life, Beauty, and Truth. It may b=
e interesting to speculate, with all the violence in the world today, the d=
estruction we might have experienced if not for this power of harmonization=
!<BR></DIV>
<DIV><U>When does all this happen? Sri Aurobindo and the Mother=
 believed that the world stage was set for this quantum descent, and that i=
t was quite imminent. The Mother said in 1968 that the supramental transfor=
mation was a certainty now, and that it would come about with a minimum of =
destruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough this minimum is still considerable.=EF=BF=BD=
 She said that the year 2000 would be a turning point.</U></DIV>
