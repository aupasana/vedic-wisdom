Namaste Lalit,
=A0
Thanks for giving me free publicity by forwarding a link=
 to what I consider to be one of my best writings ever on spiritual matters=
:
=A0
> http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/7948
=A0
This pa=
rticular writing was the culmination of a lot of observation, contemplation=
 and churning on various issues related to spirituality over a long time. O=
f course, there will be some who think it is nonsense, but there will also =
be some who will like it very much. Thanks for forwarding the link to a wid=
e group of people without my asking!
=A0
Just for the record, I do not cons=
ider myself a "spiritual guru" and nor do I want any followers.
=A0
My view=
s are obviously not perfect, because they are still evolving.
=A0
I uncondi=
tionally put out my views so that anybody who wants to benefit can benefit =
and others can just ignore. I said at the start of the above mail, "If you =
don't like my 2 cents, kindly feel free to ignore me and follow your gurus =
and others whom you may prefer." 
=A0
Whether it is my spiritual writings o=
r homam/Satya Narayan vrat/tarpana manuals or Jyotish class MP3s or Jyotish=
 software, they are all available to others freely and unconditionally and =
with genuinely no strings attached. Feel free to benefit (if you think it i=
s possible at all to benefit) or simply ignore. Very simple.
=A0
BTW, I hav=
e not disregarded "experiencing enlightenment". I have intentionally downpl=
ayed mystical experiences that may trap one and make one egoistic, so that =
one does not mistaken them for "englightenment". Instead I emphasized detac=
hment and equanimity, because those are the TRUE signs of enlightenment.
=
=A0
Experience
 of equanimity, i.e. experiencing that one's mind is calm in=
 situations 
in which it would've been agitated or angry or sad at earlier =
times, is 
the real "experience" one needs to seek and perfect.When that "e=
xperience" is perfected, THAT is enlightenment.

lous Lecturing On Adhyatma 
 

Dear Audience,
=A0
Spirituality is=A0a pacti=
cal subject, based on=A0real experiences led=A0enlightenment, This scruplou=
s guy not granted experiences is working on a cunning agenda to disregard "=
experiencing enlightenment" so that crowd may not make efforts to distincti=
fy real and fake in spitiual sadhana, and fakes like him can do the propoga=
nda in a unquestioned mannerism.
With no artifical efforts, one can capture=
 true experience since all true experiences=A0are granted by=A0God irrespec=
tive of count=A0of mantra or process of sadhana or intelligence.=A0
=A0
htt=
p://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/7948
=A0
Beware of such ine=
perienced and craving guys having=A0lust for being branded as spiritual gur=
u, This guy Narsimha, without knowing what's what, 
comfortably preaching f=
alse things to=A0 the crowd over internet, Agenda is clear, Use jugglary of=
 less understood taxonomy used in spiritual domain,
befool audience without=
 attaining elligibility,=A0why to care the=A0impact on faith, who cares acc=
ountability=A0!!=A0
=A0
Very inteliigently, such guys point at your's (audi=
ence) ego and impurities but never at their own, They w'd try entire world =
to remove ego before their own ego so that they can get satisfaction of bei=
ng better placed with winning respect while not having to respect anything =
or anybody including truth and enlightenment.=A0
=A0
Shameless Agenda:
=A0
=
Look at his mentality,=A0Doing petty Vashikaran Mantra ( To Control Others =
) and then claiming Liberation, Understand contrast and conflict that this =
scruplous guy is living with -
=A0
//=A0 I recently finished a specific sad=
hana of a specific form of Divine Mother. This particular goddess, accordin=
g to my guru, attracts others
to a sadhaka and gives "control and mastery" =
over others.=A0 //
=A0
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/8=

=A0
All False Writings On Kundalini

//
=A0
To be clear, whether one's =
Kundalini is awakened or not, and where one's
Kundalini is currently, is NO=
T a measure of one's spiritual progress.
=A0
//

He doesn't learn that awak=
ening=A0& kundalini are synonyms, since he lacks basic qualification and ex=
periences, he=A0assumes kundalini awakening is signified by feeling hot/col=
d/jolt only and since he never had these hot/cold/jolt expereinces, he is g=
iving so many reasonings, fact is, his assumptions and reasonings all are w=
rong.
=A0
Why these guys simply don't do sadhana and when God enables them,=
 give them mandate with "Atma Gyan" then they come to preaching to others, =
but that way, they can't market themselves.
=A0
Sincerly,
Lalit Mishra
