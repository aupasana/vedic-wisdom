Namaste,
 
Fantastic question! Before I answer it, I want to say that I am =
impressed with the decription of your friend. My pranaams to him. Does he l=
ive in the greater Boston area too?
 
*        *        *
 
Karma and karma=
phala (action and reaction) are like pushing something and being pushing ba=
ck as a reaction.
 
When you karmically push an object with some force and =
that object pushes you back karmically with the same force at a later point=
 of time, it is not necessary that you resist it and apply some more force =
to push again. You pushed it earlier. That is action. You are being pushed =
now. That is reaction. How you take this push and whether you resist or not=
 has nothing to do with the old action and reaction balance. IF you resist =
and apply some force NOW, it becomes a new action which will get its reacti=
on later.
 
*        *        *
 
Even a person of a high level of mental e=
quanimity and stability does have an ego. Each living person has a limited =
ego (I-ness) which binds him to a body and an identity (e.g. PVR Narasimha =
Rao, who looks like this, who knows so and so things, who does so and so th=
ings, who wants so and so things, who is the husband of Padmaja, who is the=
 father of Sriharini and Sriharish, who is the sishya of Manish Pandit etc =
etc). If the binding is completely removed and one becomes completely unbou=
nd from that limited sense of I-ness, one will no longer remain in the body=
. So any embodied being must have a limited ego (I-ness). As one dies and g=
ets reborn, this ego (sense of I-ness) is cut off from one body and environ=
ment and re-attached to another body and environment. Nature tracks this ch=
ange. Just as post office delivers all mail addressed to your old apartment=
 to your new apartment when you change address, Nature delivers the reactio=
ns of all previous life actions to the sense of I-ness in this life.
 
As l=
ong as one is embodied and has a sense of I-ness, Nature will continue to d=
eliver the reactions to various previous actions from that being. Death of =
wife in an accident, getting an Oscar award, losing an election, being crit=
icized by thousand people, being hit by wife, being abused by husband, bein=
g killed by a brother, being cheated by a friend etc etc are examples of re=
actions to previous actions. As long as one's sense of I-ness is bound to a=
 body, Nature will continue to deliver reactions to previous actions. If on=
e gets an Oscar award as a result of previous good karma, it is not necessa=
ry that one should be happy or excited or elated. Do not think that a react=
ion from Nature to one's good karma is meaningful only if that reaction mak=
es one happy. How one feels NOW is irrelevant. If one is cheated, it is not=
 necessary that one should feel sad or angry. Do not think that a reaction =
from Nature to one's bad karma is meaningful only if that reaction disappoi=
nts him. You cheated someone. Nature will arrange such that that person che=
ats you now. How you feel about it now is not relevant as far as the old ac=
tion-reaction equation is concerned. Thus, being equanimous, equal-minded a=
nd calm does not stop Nature from doing its job.
 
In fact, it is better th=
at way. By not reacting to what is happening now, one is preventing new kar=
mas. Suppose you cheated a person in a previous life. Suppose Nature arrang=
ed for that person to cheat you now. His cheating you is merely a reaction =
to your own action (but if he does it with self-identification with the act=
ion, it becomes a new karma for that person. But, that is irrelevant to you=
). If you just face it calmly and without doing anything, you finish off yo=
ur karmic debt. Instead, suppose you fight and try to stop the person from =
cheating you. Then your current actions would become a NEW karma and you wi=
ll have to face its reaction later. If you want to pay off old debts withou=
t incurring new ones, you have to behave like the person you described belo=
w. Accept whatever comes your way with neither happiness nor sadness, but w=
ith a calm and relaxed mind. On top of it, keep doing what seems like the r=
ight thing to do at the moment, with as little self-identification (sense o=
f "I am doing this") as possible. As you become better at this, your instin=
cts and judgment will guide you better and show you the right action.
 
Bes=
t regards,
Narasimha
