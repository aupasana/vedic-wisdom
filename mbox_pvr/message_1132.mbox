Namaste,

In my judgment, a rudraksha mala is more than enough for Ganesha sadhana.

For Lakshmi, kamalagutta mala (a garland of lotus seeds) is considered the 
best. I did use one that was gifted by the same priest who gifted me so many 
other religious articles. However, in my judgment, I had more fruitful 
sessions of Mahalakshmi meditation with Rudraksha mala than with it. 
Rudraksha and Tulasi are very special compared to all other malas.

Instead of using a different mala for each deity, it is a good idea to use a 
single mala for all meditation and let it be a repository of all the 
generated energy.

*        *        *

This reminds me of an unrelated incident. When Shata Chandi homam conducted 
in Chennai in March 2006 was finished, priests bathed the idols in the 
garbhaalaya with the water from the kalashas (pots) used in the homas and 
brought malas from the idol and gave them to us. The priest put a Rudraksha 
mala from the Mother around my neck. A passing thought came to me and got 
stuck in my mind for a couple of seconds, "I already have so many rudraksha 
malas, but I have no sphatika mala, which is considered ideal for the 
Mother. I just took a vow of doing Chandipath for 108 days. I wish he had 
given me a sphatika mala instead of this rudraksha mala." Then I forgot 
about that stupid thought.

This was in the afternoon. Next morning, we were in a flight from Chennai to 
Hyderabad. In another day, I was to leave for Boston. In the flight to
Hyderabad, my son was kicking the seat in front of him and the gentleman 
turned back to complain. I apologized and told my son to behave. The 
gentleman turned forward and again turned back in a few seconds and asked 
"you are PVR Narasimha Rao, right?" I said yes. He apparently uses my free 
Jyotish software and likes me. Though I had offered all my hair to Balaji at 
Thirumala a few days back and was without any hair, he still identified me 
based on a photo published 6 years back in an interview in a Jyotish 
magazine! He talked to me for a while.

When we reached Hyderabad, he ran to the baggage claim, collected his 
suitcase, took out a sphatika mala from it and gifted it to me. He said he 
met a saint on the previous afternoon at Chennai and the saint gave him 
three sphatika malas - one for him, one for a family member and the third 
one meant for someone else. The saint told him that he would meet somebody 
he respected on the next day and he was supposed to hand over the mala to 
that person. When he saw me, he decided that the mala was meant for me. 
Interestingly, his meeting with the saint happened around the same time I 
had that stupid thought about sphatika mala in the garbhalaya of the temple.

During shata Chandi homam, I took a vow to read Chandipath for 108 
consecutive days. I did it and used that mala to count the moola mantra. At 
the end, that priest came to Boston and conducted 10 Chandi homas at our 
house to complete the sadhana. During the last homam, a strong thought came 
to my mind, "the purpose for which that sphatika mala was sent is over. Now 
offer it back to the Mother in fire." I suppressed my instincts and did not 
do it. I wanted to hang on to it. See, I formed an attachment with it! 
Interestingly, that mala broke on the same evening, a little after that 
homam was finished! Of course, I made a mala again with the sphatikas and 
kept it for offering it in fire next time. Now I realized that my attachment 
was foolish.

Of course, I did Chandipath and Chandi homam many more times after that, but 
that was the first 108 and I was destined to use the mala given by that 
saint for that round. Now, of course, I use the same rudraksha mala for 
everything and did not look for another sphatika mala.

*        *        *

It is the nature of mind to see variety. There are different types of malas 
and different kinds of rituals and mind is fascinated by the variety. At the 
end, mind needs to be trained to see the same in the variety. But, in the 
beginning, mind does see variety and it needs to wade through variety...

Best regards,
Narasimha
