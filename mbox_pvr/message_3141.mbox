Namaste,
 
Seeking forgiveness means that one realizes one's mistake, repents for it, learns the lessons and wishes that the people affected by one's mistake overcome the grief caused by it.
 
Accepting one's mistakes and sincerely repenting for them is a very useful thing.
 
*        *        *
 
Suppose X causes harm to Y. Suppose Y is living the consequence of that harm and remembering every now and then about it with negative emotions. The thoughts in Y's mind are creating a force against X. Even if Y does not know who did that harm to him and just curses the anonymous person who caused that harms, his negative emotions about his situation still create a force against X!
 
If X repents and asks for forgiveness and Y forgives, it may reduce negative emotions in Y's mind in future and the resultant kaarmik force working on X.
 
Even seeking forgiveness from god when one is not in direct contact with the persons affected by one's misdeeds can help. God is another name for the all powerful Nature which connects all beings and through which the principles of karma and the forces of actions and reactions operate.
 
What one does cannot be undone. But, sometimes, a lot of effect of misdeeds is mental. Even after the physical or material harm of an action is finished, people hang on to it emotionally and that causes continual grief. THAT can be undone, even though the original action cannot be undone. Mental force of one person can intervene and affect the emotions of another mind. If X repents for the misdeed committed and sincerely wishes for Y to overcome the grief, the kaarmik force created by that thought can help Y in overcoming the negative emotions caused by the misdeed of X towards Y.
 
*        *        *
 
Repentance is an act in which mind is filled with a deep sense of regret and a sincere wish for those affected by it to overcome its consequences. If that is not there, there is not much point in seeking forgiveness. It is not that useful or meaningful to seek forgiveness for one's actions out of selfishness or greed and without real regret and sincere compassion for those affected by one's misdeeds.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
