To Hindus, t=\r\nhe correct term &lt;br&gt;&gt;is &quot;sanatana dharma&quot;, i.e. perennial spirit of righ=\r\nteousness&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Intrestingly, last week i was in Oman and i had a same dis=\r\ncussion &lt;br&gt;with one of the client&#39;s representative. He was Aarab national =\r\nand &lt;br&gt;wanted to know something about Hindu religeon. First thing i told h=\r\nim &lt;br&gt;that &#39;Hindu&#39; is a foreign word and none of our scripture uses this &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;word.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is my long time belief that Sanaatan Dharma=\r\n will never perish. &lt;br&gt;my logic is simple. in the recorded history, People=\r\n from Sanaatan &lt;br&gt;Dharma has never attacked the other religion. The glorio=\r\nus example &lt;br&gt;(which i am very proud of quoting) is Paarasi Community. The=\r\ny came to &lt;br&gt;India for saving their community and religeon and our people =\r\nniether &lt;br&gt;rejected them nor influenced them to convert in to our religeon=\r\n. they &lt;br&gt;flourished in our country in\n trade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Sana=\r\natan Dharma was in great danger, Lord sent Shivaaji to &lt;br&gt;control it. earl=\r\nier Addi Shankara camedown for it. Now it is our &lt;br&gt;responsibility to see =\r\nto it that we live its value in our life.. and &lt;br&gt;we need not forget the f=\r\namous assurance &quot;Sambhavaami Yuge yuge!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;but is everybody&#39;s duty to =\r\ndo their bit so that this glorious &lt;br&gt;Tradition of Sanaatan Dharam never g=\r\nets diminished.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;best Regards,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Utpal &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;=\r\nnofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;=\r\nvedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ ...&gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Namaste&lt;br&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Very true inde=\r\ned. Hinduism has faced some of the severest assults &lt;br&gt;across histroy from=\r\n various groups of invaders, we do not have a &lt;br&gt;central religious authori=\r\nty governing all Hindus and yet Hinduism &lt;br&gt;exists inspite of severe perse=\r\ncution that it had faced from other\n &lt;br&gt;religions.=C2&nbsp;It is truely am=\r\nazing.&lt;br&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; And this too is correct, as you said, Sana=\r\ntan Dharma can never &lt;br&gt;perish. Nature is with him who follows this dharma=\r\n. Yet, when I see &lt;br&gt;people and there are plenty of them, trying to malign=\r\n, belittle or &lt;br&gt;delibetaly spread misinformation and disrespect for Hindu=\r\nism, it gets &lt;br&gt;a little too much to bear. And then I wonder, inspite of s=\r\no many &lt;br&gt;great great souls having incarnated in this holy land, why does =\r\n&lt;br&gt;Sanatan Dharma=C2&nbsp;have to go through such phases.&lt;br&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Maybe it is the disease of the age we live in. One feels frustate=\r\nd &lt;br&gt;and angry at how things are going and feel like doing something about=\r\n &lt;br&gt;it, yet we do not what needs to be done.

However, despite foreign invasion and &lt;br&gt;complete &lt;br&gt;&gt; foreign contr=\r\nol of India for a millennium,\n Hinduism\n is still &lt;br&gt;basically doing &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; ok. True, some damage has been done, but it is still standing tall &lt;br&gt;=\r\nand firm &lt;br&gt;&gt; enough. Isn&#39;t it amazing?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; In fact, Hindu=\r\nism is a word coined by outsiders. To Hindus, the &lt;br&gt;correct term &lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n is &quot;sanatana dharma&quot;, i.e. perennial spirit of righteousness. By &lt;br&gt;defin=\r\nition, &lt;br&gt;&gt; it is perennial. I am firmly convinced that it cannot be de=\r\nstroyed. &lt;br&gt;Even if &lt;br&gt;&gt; it seems close to extinction, it will come ba=\r\nck up. That is the &lt;br&gt;nature of &lt;br&gt;&gt; this dharma. I am not worried abo=\r\nut Sanatana dharma being damaged &lt;br&gt;or &lt;br&gt;&gt; destroyed.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; I will continue to discharge what *I* believe nature expects from &lt;br&gt;*me=\r\n* and &lt;br&gt;&gt; what I believe is *my* dharma, without any worry whatsoever =\r\nthat &lt;br&gt;sanatana &lt;br&gt;&gt; dharma is in some kind of danger of extinction. =\r\nHowever, such a &lt;br&gt;belief is &lt;br&gt;&gt; vital for some people to discharge *=\r\ntheir* dharma and hence we have\n &lt;br&gt;some &lt;br&gt;&gt; people driven by that se=\r\nnse of danger and the resulting fear and &lt;br&gt;anger. That &lt;br&gt;&gt; is ok too=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Sadguru Samartha Ramadas is not a=\r\nn ordinary soul.
