How can i again experience =\r\nthe Beloved.\n&gt;             That then is the experience of mantra when it is=\r\n done correctly.\n&gt;             When the sadhak&#39;s personality is effaced suc=\r\nh that the deity&#39;s personality sits there then the sadhak experiences himse=\r\nlf as that Deity(Devata).\n&gt;             There then arises no difference in =\r\nthe sadhak or the deity commanding a certain thing to happen( be it what ap=\r\npears to be good or be it that which appears to be bad) . The deity&#39;s perso=\r\nnality is crucial. Ugra devatas make the person care almost for nothing him=\r\nself, so self identification is minimised and the person&#39;s spiritual evolut=\r\nion continues.\n&gt;             Remember, there is very little according to me=\r\n which is black magic. It is all a use of Shakti. If your Shakti and deity =\r\nis a higher shakti such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, =\r\nthen your power will be that of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana). Af=\r\nter the death of the body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the deity or i=\r\nf he was originally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm reserved for =\r\nthese beings. \n&gt;             Attacking such a sadhak brings the full bearin=\r\ng of karma onto the heads of the attackers and some people may realise this=\r\n to their detriment( Patan comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Pa=\r\ntan with his Shakti causing an earthquake). Some people may even equate thi=\r\ns with black magic. Here there is only action and reaction.(Bit like you at=\r\ntack a normal person, and you will get a result of this from that same Atma=\r\n whom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack somebody =\r\nwho is identifying with the universe and has very few karmas left, then the=\r\n Universe itself attacks you, because your attack is not on the sadhaka, bu=\r\nt on his identification, ie God or the universe).\n&gt;             If people p=\r\nersist in using the Shakti possesed by a small Pisacha, Bhuta, then there i=\r\ns only a little Shakti which can be used, moreover then their minds and int=\r\nellects will not be free of identification with the body and so their actio=\r\nns are those which are generally termed as black magic. These people usuall=\r\ny join the same spirits which they have been using after death, this is not=\r\n an enjoyable experience.\n&gt;             Imagine if somebody is worshipping =\r\nChandika for a few lifetimes, then even in this birth he or she is drawn to=\r\n that deity and such a sadhak may acheive after a few repitions of a mantra=\r\n(because of his previous effort).\n&gt;             On the other hand somebody =\r\ndoing this mantra only in this lifetime may feel that the 64 things which b=\r\nind every mantra are crucial and may not acheive in this lifetime.\n&gt;       =\r\n      According to me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let me =\r\nsuggest an easy sadhana.\n&gt;             If one is so inclined, then starting=\r\n on some good day, do 1000 reititions of the Savitri(some call this the Gay=\r\natri, but the real Gayatri is hidden) every day, main constraints\n&gt;        =\r\n     Same time every day.\n&gt;             Same place.\n&gt;             Same mate=\r\nrials.\n&gt;             Same direction.\n&gt;             As little movement as on=\r\ne can.\n&gt;             Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.\n&gt; =\r\n            Complete restraint on sex(from the mind and the body, not just =\r\nthe body), reduce food intake, grow a beard.\n&gt;             Do not eat 2 hrs=\r\n before you start, make sure your bowels are empty before you start.\n&gt;     =\r\n        Continue this for 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 times.\n&gt;  =\r\n           See the difference in your personality before and after.\n&gt;      =\r\n       Long and short , what is important is that life may be short, so do =\r\nsome sadhana, and persist with that sadhana for as long as is physically po=\r\nssible.\n&gt;             I hope this clarifies some of the concepts which were=\r\n being discussed.\n&gt; \n&gt;             Kind Love and Regards\n&gt;             mani=\r\nsh\n&gt;             You may post this on the list as a clarification from me i=\r\nf you feel that this is suitable.\n&gt; \n&gt;             On Sun, Mar 1, 2009 at 1=\r\n0:12 PM, Narasimha P.V.R.

Now where did that come from?\n&gt;               &gt; How is it related=\r\n to what is under discussion. Perhaps I have missed many\n&gt;               &gt; =\r\nmails and am not able to get the context. Trying to command God is\n&gt;       =\r\n        &gt; *BLACK MAGIC* and this is detestable to say the least. The attitu=\r\nde should\n&gt;               &gt; always be that of a beggar in front of God. If =\r\nanyone has said otherwise, I\n&gt;               &gt; also disagee with him/her.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt;               I mentioned the above with respect to the need of thousan=\r\nds of mantras and technicalities. If one does not want to command god and w=\r\nants to be a beggar who will take whatever is given, there is no need for t=\r\nhousands of mantras and all the umpteen technicalities. These thousands of =\r\nmantras and umpteen technicalities are for commanding thousands of differen=\r\nt results from god. That is why I talked of commanding vs begging. However,=\r\n this commanding works slightly differently than one may imagine. I will el=\r\naborate.\n&gt; \n&gt;               Also, commanding god is NOT black magic. Comman=\r\nding low level beings is black magic, which can be accomplished even by a p=\r\nerson not quite elevated spiritually and suffering from a heavy ego. Howeve=\r\nr, commanding higher beings such as gods is possible only for a spiritually=\r\n elevated person with no or extremely small ego. This commanding that I am =\r\nreferring to is not an egoistic achievement. In fact, an egoist cannot achi=\r\neve it. Only a person succeeding in completely effacing individual ego can =\r\nachieve this commanding! I will repeat something from the previous mail to =\r\nclarify:\n&gt; \n&gt;               The universe has many lokas (planes of consciou=\r\nsness), many beings and many objects. There are infinite karmic interaction=\r\ns possible between them. Accordingly, there are infinite possible mantras. =\r\nWhen one is able to perfectly control the mind and *fill it* with a mantra =\r\n(i.e. no thoughts but the mantra reverberating in the mind constantly), the=\r\nn one experiences the mantra. This perfect absorption of self-awareness in =\r\nthe mantra then causes internal changes by the flow of energy internally in=\r\n specific ways (specific to the mantra) and that causes corresponding exter=\r\nnal changes in the universe and corresponding karmic interactions between v=\r\narious objects.\n&gt; \n&gt;               Each set of &quot;karmic interactions between=\r\n various objects&quot; is a &quot;result&quot;. Various mantras are for various &quot;results&quot;.=\r\n One may term merging self-awareness in a mantra fully and getting a specif=\r\nic result from it as &quot;commanding a result&quot; from god. Whether you like the t=\r\nerm or not, it is essentially that.\n&gt; \n&gt;               *        *        *\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt;               But the bottomline is this: Only a highly purified sadha=\r\nka of very low ego can command specific results from god (not for selfishne=\r\nss or even ego satisfaction, but acting as an unattached instrument of Natu=\r\nre fulfilling one&#39;s dharma set by Nature). Various mantras and technicaliti=\r\nes of mantra shastra taught by rishis are meant for such sadhakas.\n&gt; \n&gt;    =\r\n           Those are hardly of use to so many people out there with dense e=\r\ngos seeking specific selfish results. They cannot command specific results =\r\nfrom god (because of their heavy attachment to the result, which is in turn=\r\n due to their own attachment to a limited ego), even if they use all the te=\r\nchniques of mantra shastra and all the associated rules of astrology. Inste=\r\nad of wasting their time with these technicalities, they will be better off=\r\n learning to be good beggars at God&#39;s door.\n&gt; \n&gt;               Just pick an=\r\ny prasiddha mantra or a mantra you feel attracted to, without worrying abou=\r\nt so many technicalities, and learn to be humble and surrender to the Lord.=\r\n Patiently wait for him to give you what you want. Like a beggar, take what=\r\never and whenever he gives.\n&gt; \n&gt;               Keep praying every day or ev=\r\nery second when you are able to. Even when you are not praying, remember hi=\r\nm in all of your actions. When you enjoy something in the material world, t=\r\nell yourself that it is his and that he gave it to you. If you remember him=\r\n all the time, slowly the dirt in your mind will start to get cleaned. This=\r\n fixing of attitude is faaaaaaaaaaaar more important than picking the right=\r\n mantra, right weekday, right tithi etc (that too based on unreliable knowl=\r\nedge coming from questionable sources!).\n&gt; \n&gt;               *        *     =\r\n   *\n&gt; \n&gt;               There may be a mountain with thousands of paths (ma=\r\nntra) for climbing it. Each path may lead to a different spot (different ex=\r\nperience) on the top and show a different scenery (result). Expert advisors=\r\n (astrologers) may tell you to use a specific path (mantra) to see a specif=\r\nic scenery (result). But such advice is useless to a handicapped person wit=\r\nhout legs (a selfish person with dense ego). It is relevant only to person =\r\nwith legs and one who is strong and sturdy, who can successfully climb the =\r\nmountain (a reasonably detached person with very little ego).\n&gt; \n&gt;         =\r\n      Even when you encounter a person who has legs and can actually climb =\r\nthe mountain, the stress should be on how to climb the mountain and travers=\r\ne the long path, rather than which path to take. The astrologers who are bo=\r\ngged down by all the technicalities and people who take customized mantra a=\r\ndvice from astrologers and think that they will get a result quickly by doi=\r\nng that &#39;powerful&#39; mantra are missing the basic point. The power of a power=\r\nful mantra is with respect to the experience and result obtained *after* on=\r\ne succeeds with the mantra. A partcicularly powerful mantra is akin to a pa=\r\nth leading to a point atop the mountain where the view shows a particularly=\r\n beautiful scenery. But the bottomline is that you do have to survive the c=\r\nlimb along the long path.\n&gt; \n&gt;               We need to emphasize the attit=\r\nude and approach needed for the long climb, rather than emphasizing the cho=\r\nice of the path based on horoscope. It is worth noting that so many great s=\r\npiritual teachers who came in the last century or two did not emphasize pic=\r\nking the right mantra based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasized havi=\r\nng the correct attitude - surrender, submission, devotion, patience, persis=\r\ntence, discipline, humility etc!!!! *That* is a lot more important and usef=\r\nul than trying to be oversmart with the choice of mantra, day etc and impre=\r\nss god.\n&gt; \n&gt;               *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt;               &gt; when sh=\r\nould the worship of a graha be done? Let us say someone\n&gt;               &gt; w=\r\nishes to worship Mars (Mangala graha). When do you think this\n&gt;            =\r\n   &gt; worship should be done?\n&gt;                \n&gt;               You can do a=\r\nnyday. Parasara does not mention any day for doing homam to a graha.\n&gt; \n&gt;  =\r\n             In fact, if one wants, one can do a homam or worship to Mars (=\r\nor any planet) every day. It is even better that way.\n&gt; \n&gt;               If=\r\n an astrologer suggests doing it on a Tuesday, it is fine. But saying that =\r\ndoing it on so and so day will bring serious dangers because Mars is an ene=\r\nmy of so and so planet would be stretching things.\n&gt; \n&gt;               &gt; [Sa=\r\nnjay Rath:] Where do you think Veda Vyasa (Krishna dvaipaayana) got his\n&gt;  =\r\n             &gt; knowledge and those who wrote it as scribes for him, where d=\r\nid they get it from?\n&gt;                \n&gt;               From Self - from wit=\r\nhin.

Gandanta requires a *transition* in a con=\r\ntiguous space.\n&gt; \n&gt;               In your example of upapada lord&#39;s tithi, =\r\nthere is no contiguous space where there is a water-fire transition.\n&gt; \n&gt;  =\r\n             &gt; Now somewhere you talked of wasting time!!!

OK, just spell it out. What is the reason for Gandanta being in 0 deg, =\r\n120 deg and 240 deg of the zodiac if it is not a junction between agni and =\r\njala...I want to her your words if you have any. You keep saying Parasara s=\r\nays so and yet there is nothing forthcoming.\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt;          =\r\n     &gt; The rashi is associated with the Aditya as the rashi come into exist=\r\nence because of the Sun, which is the agni tattva. Vara is also agni tattva=\r\n among the panchanga of Jyotisha. That is why Vaara is related to rashi. Ka=\r\nrma has been advised in the vaara of the lords of the rashi or the hora of =\r\nthe lords of the rashi related to a bhaava and for this reason, fasting and=\r\n other such karma related to rashi are also based on this. [See Prashna Mar=\r\nga for details].\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt;               &gt; Moon is the significa=\r\ntor of the Aroodha. It is the *emotional content* related to the maya manif=\r\nestation of everything in life. Suffering is caused as we do not fathom the=\r\n karma associated that resulted in suffering and fasting is a a means of se=\r\nlf punishment and correction related to the raashi where the aroodha is. Ju=\r\nst as Agni has the purity to burn the root of sin, fasting on vaara related=\r\n to the UL is surely going to cleanse the sins associated with the sufferin=\r\ng in it. While this may not give a 100% satisfaction as the *moon* content =\r\nhas not been addressed, at least the initiation of the aroodha occurs and p=\r\neople find their partners, get married and get along with life. Proof lies =\r\nin the pudding and with so many cases where people have fasted on UL days a=\r\nnd have got result, we have found faith in these teachings reinforced. Why =\r\nfast? Fasting on vaara is a means to correcting the flaw associated with th=\r\ne raashi. Raashi is a quantity and hence it is related to the material effe=\r\ncts of the bhava and that is what people are looking for when they come to =\r\nth astrologer. You have done well to recall my teachings in this =C3=A2=E2=\r\n=82=AC=E2=80=9C remember what I taught =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C Men should =\r\nworship a female deity and women shold worship a male deity for the UL fast=\r\ning. I wonder if they really follow this.\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt;             =\r\n  &gt; Why not give fasting at night instead of day? Sun is always good for th=\r\ne Upapada (Jaimini etc) and that is why we have limited this to day fasting=\r\n and not night fasting as well or 24 hour fast. This is my interpolation. [=\r\n satisfied J ] Elders would have given long periods of fast starting from t=\r\nhe vaara, like keeping 21 days fast for the birth of child! You think I sho=\r\nuld be doing that! You think anyone will lsiten. Try it yourself before ask=\r\ning me to advise those hard penance kind of fasts.\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt;    =\r\n           &gt; Who says the Moon has nothing to do with the arudha. It is the=\r\n sustainer. Now people to an astrologer when they are looking for getting m=\r\narried and hardly anyone comes these days asking for prolonging marriage. E=\r\nither they want to get into one or get out of one and into another...astrol=\r\nogers these days are relegated to helping people make these transitions pai=\r\nnless and fast. Of course some have come and I have not failed them. I have=\r\n a ready shloka for this =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C start from Taurus in Hams=\r\na gati:\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt;               &gt; Gouri, Kaali, Uma, Bhadraa, Du=\r\nrga, Kanti, Saraswati\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt;               &gt; Mangalaa, Vaishn=\r\navi, Lakshmi, Shivaa, Naraayani\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt;               &gt; See I =\r\nhave them ready for the 12 signs in Hamsa Gati from the mool trikona of Moo=\r\nn in hamsa gati\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt;               &gt; Mantra Shastra is a ve=\r\nry detailed work and includes mantra dosha etc. It is very scientific and a=\r\nccurate.

His section on remedial measures is full of va=\r\nrious homas. I am not dismissing those remedies taught by Parasara himself =\r\nand I am in fact slowly preparing manuals on them so that anybody can do th=\r\nem by themselves.\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt;               &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] what =\r\nabout the Puranas? Have you gone through the Navagraha mantras given in the=\r\n Garuda Purana and other puranic literature?\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt;          =\r\n     &gt; Parasara did *not* specify the weekday or tithi for most of these ho=\r\nmas (e.g. planetary homas). Only for homas for specific birth doshas (e.g. =\r\nAmavasya dosha or Moola dosha), he fixed the tithi or nakshatra based on th=\r\ne dosha and the deity. But the days are not based on any house or arudha in=\r\n the chart.\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt;               &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] If Amavasya=\r\n dosha is to be performed on Amavasya, when should the worship of a graha b=\r\ne done? Let us say someone wishes to worship Mars (Mangala graha). When do =\r\nyou think this worship should be done?\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt;               &gt;=\r\n Thus, the principles I am questioning are *not* from Parasara.\n&gt;          =\r\n     &gt; \n&gt;               &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Where do you think Veda Vyasa (Kri=\r\nshna dvaipaayana) got his knowledge and those who wrote it as scribes for h=\r\nim, where did they get it from?\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt;               &gt; Second=\r\n, I said what I said in a *context*. People are mentioning complicated prin=\r\nciples that are not found in classics or works of rishis and scaring people=\r\n that performing austerities such as fasting on certain days cause &quot;danger =\r\nto spouse&quot; or &quot;serious doshas&quot; or &quot;insult to Vishnu&quot;, based on horoscope. I=\r\n find these principles illogical and based on hasty thinking. There may be =\r\na little difference between doing an austerity on different days, but my po=\r\nint is that it is smaller compared to the difference between doing and not =\r\ndoing at all and that doing it on a &quot;wrong day&quot; does not cause danger as be=\r\ning suggested.\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt;               &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I am sor=\r\nry. I missed the context and just saw some mails that were forwarded to me =\r\namidst my writing. But them its always a pleasure to talk to you as in that=\r\n many many have benefitted, and that includes us as well.\n&gt;               &gt;=\r\n \n&gt;               &gt; Third, our shastras primarily talk about worshipping va=\r\nrious deities on various days, based on the energy of the *deity*. For wors=\r\nhipping a certain deity, certain tithi or weekday or nakshatra is better th=\r\nan others. This is based on the deity and irrespective of the person worshi=\r\npping. Let me give an analogy. If a rich man comes out with more money to g=\r\nive to beggars on a specific day, a beggar is better off going and begging =\r\non that day. Schedule and mood of the giver is more important.\n&gt;           =\r\n    &gt; \n&gt;               &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] That=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s not r=\r\night...at least people who read this will think. Let=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=\r\n=A2s say Shiva worship on Mondays. Shiva is the pratyadhi devata of the Sun=\r\n and is not worshipped on Sundays but on Mondays. NOTE =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=\r\n=80=9C a day after Sunday! Similarly Narayana is the pratyadhi devata of Me=\r\nrcury and is worshipped on Thursdays instead of Wednesdays. NOTE =C3=A2=E2=\r\n=82=AC=E2=80=9C again a day after! So what happened to the energy equation?=\r\n J\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt;               &gt; Choosing the day of a remedy based =\r\non the deity is more important and the variations based on individual horos=\r\ncope are less important. I am not saying there are no horoscopic variations=\r\n. But they are smaller and, more importantly, I question if they are actual=\r\nly well-understood by astrologers today to apply *reliably*. I question ove=\r\nr-emphasizing and over-selling unreliable principles of questionable origin=\r\n and scaring people on that basis.\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt;               &gt; [Sa=\r\nnjay Rath:] To this I can agree as many have not understood even the basics=\r\n of Sanatana dharma!

I got=\r\n into this thread because statements were made that fasting on particular w=\r\neekdays or tithis in a chart can cause &quot;insult to Vishnu&quot;, &quot;serious doshas&quot;=\r\n and &quot;danger to spouse&quot;, based on these far-fetched extrapolations of ganda=\r\nnta.\n&gt; \n&gt;               &gt; Which is perfectly in line with everything I have=\r\n learnt.\n&gt; \n&gt;               Well, you once taught that houses represent Sun=\r\n/Shiva/truth and arudhas represent Moon/Gouri/perception. That was meaningf=\r\nul. Now, you associated UL, an arudha, with Sun and fire and 12th, a house,=\r\n with Gouri and water. I question whether the new theory on fasting is real=\r\nly in line with everything you have learnt (and taught).\n&gt; \n&gt;              =\r\n BTW, I specifically asked for a clarification on whether this was based on=\r\n your own thinking or from classics/parampara (see quoted mail below for th=\r\ne full context). Like so many times with similar questions I asked privatel=\r\ny and recently publicly, you did not respond.\n&gt; \n&gt;               *        *=\r\n        *\n&gt; \n&gt;               &gt; Statement 1 is an arrogance that the entire =\r\nJyotisha shastra is bogus\n&gt;               &gt; and has no relevance as the rem=\r\nedial measures prescribed by\n&gt;               &gt; Parasara and others to be do=\r\nne on specific days are irrlevant and\n&gt;               &gt; not of much consequ=\r\nence.\n&gt; \n&gt;               First of all, Parasara did *not* prescribe fasting=\r\n on specific weekdays or tithis based on any arudhas or houses in a chart.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt;               For doshas in birth chart or to get relief from planetar=\r\ny afflictions or to get the blessings of planets, he suggested various *hom=\r\nas* (fire rituals) and described how to perform them. His section on remedi=\r\nal measures is full of various homas. I am not dismissing those remedies ta=\r\nught by Parasara himself and I am in fact slowly preparing manuals on them =\r\nso that anybody can do them by themselves.\n&gt; \n&gt;               Parasara did =\r\n*not* specify the weekday or tithi for most of these homas (e.g. planetary =\r\nhomas). Only for homas for specific birth doshas (e.g. Amavasya dosha or Mo=\r\nola dosha), he fixed the tithi or nakshatra based on the dosha and the deit=\r\ny. But the days are not based on any house or arudha in the chart.\n&gt; \n&gt;    =\r\n           Thus, the principles I am questioning are *not* from Parasara.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt;               Second, I said what I said in a *context*. People are men=\r\ntioning complicated principles that are not found in classics or works of r=\r\nishis and scaring people that performing austerities such as fasting on cer=\r\ntain days cause &quot;danger to spouse&quot; or &quot;serious doshas&quot; or &quot;insult to Vishnu=\r\n&quot;, based on horoscope. I find these principles illogical and based on hasty=\r\n thinking. There may be a little difference between doing an austerity on d=\r\nifferent days, but my point is that it is smaller compared to the differenc=\r\ne between doing and not doing at all and that doing it on a &quot;wrong day&quot; doe=\r\ns not cause danger as being suggested.\n&gt; \n&gt;               Third, our shastr=\r\nas primarily talk about worshipping various deities on various days, based =\r\non the energy of the *deity*. For worshipping a certain deity, certain tith=\r\ni or weekday or nakshatra is better than others. This is based on the deity=\r\n and irrespective of the person worshipping. Let me give an analogy. If a r=\r\nich man comes out with more money to give to beggars on a specific day, a b=\r\neggar is better off going and begging on that day. Schedule and mood of the=\r\n giver is more important.\n&gt; \n&gt;               Choosing the day of a remedy b=\r\nased on the deity is more important and the variations based on individual =\r\nhoroscope are less important. I am not saying there are no horoscopic varia=\r\ntions. But they are smaller and, more importantly, I question if they are a=\r\nctually well-understood by astrologers today to apply *reliably*. I questio=\r\nn over-emphasizing and over-selling unreliable principles of questionable o=\r\nrigin and scaring people on that basis.\n&gt; \n&gt;               *        *      =\r\n  *\n&gt; \n&gt;               &gt; Statement 2 is an arrogance that the entire mantra=\r\n shastra is useless\n&gt;               &gt; and the Rishi=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2=\r\ns were wasting time in giving so many mantras for\n&gt;               &gt; the sam=\r\ne devata, like say thousands of mantras for Vishnu or Hanuman\n&gt;            =\r\n   &gt; when any one mantra would suffice. OR it is like saying that we can\n&gt; =\r\n              &gt; take paracetamol and pray that cancer is cured. I think I m=\r\nay have to\n&gt;               &gt; write a book on Mantra Shastra to validate the=\r\n teachings of the vedic\n&gt;               &gt; seers.\n&gt; \n&gt;               I did n=\r\not say it is &quot;useless&quot;. Instead, I suggest that our ability to use it is li=\r\nmited and we should take our limitations into consideration.\n&gt; \n&gt;          =\r\n     The universe has many lokas (planes of consciousness), many beings and=\r\n many objects. There are infinite karmic interactions possible between them=\r\n. Accordingly, there are infinite possible mantras. When one is able to per=\r\nfectly control the mind and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but t=\r\nhe mantra reverberating in the mind constantly), then one experiences the m=\r\nantra. This perfect absorption of self-awareness in the mantra then causes =\r\ninternal changes by the flow of energy internally in specific ways (specifi=\r\nc to the mantra) and that causes corresponding external changes in the univ=\r\nerse and corresponding karmic interactions between various objects.\n&gt; \n&gt;   =\r\n            However, this variety of mantras, experiences and results is ir=\r\nrelevant to one who does not have such perfect control over the mind to abs=\r\norb the mind fully in a mantra. It is relevant only to a seer whose self-aw=\r\nareness is quite evolved and hence control over mind impeccable. Such seers=\r\n are extremely extremely rare today. Most people are unable to experience a=\r\nny mantra and mantras do not work for them as they are supposed to.\n&gt; \n&gt;   =\r\n            *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt;               Just repeating a combina=\r\ntion of sounds does not guarantee anything. Some people may think that cert=\r\nain results come when they repeat a mantra certain number of times. That is=\r\n an incorrect notion. A mantra may work for one person quickly and another =\r\nmay spend the whole life chanting it and nothing may happen. Absorption of =\r\nthe entire mind into a mantra is needed for a mantra to really work and it =\r\nis much more difficult than one may think.\n&gt; \n&gt;               *        *   =\r\n     *\n&gt; \n&gt;               A highly learned scholar in the court of a king m=\r\nay be able to command the king and get whatever he wants from king. An inca=\r\npable one is better off begging the king, rather than trying to command (an=\r\nd failing for sure).\n&gt; \n&gt;               Similarly, most people are better o=\r\nff begging god for what they want rather than trying to use the right mantr=\r\na to command what they want. A beggar does not need a huge vocabulary or gr=\r\neat scholarship or knowledge. Feeling of humility and helplessness, surrend=\r\ner, patience and persistence are what help a beggar succeed. A beggar needs=\r\n the right attitude rather than knowledge. In this age and time, best bet f=\r\nor most people is to learn to be a good beggar at god&#39;s door.\n&gt; \n&gt;         =\r\n      What people today need for material and spiritual progress through re=\r\nmedial measures is a better attitude in begging god rather than a better ch=\r\noice of tools such as mantras and other specifics such as weekday, tithi et=\r\nc to command a specific result from god.\n&gt; \n&gt;               It is worth not=\r\ning that so many great spiritual teachers who came in the last century or t=\r\nwo did not emphasize picking the right mantra based on horoscope etc. Inste=\r\nad, they emphasized having the correct attitude - surrender, submission, de=\r\nvotion, patience, persistence, discipline, humility etc. *That* is a lot mo=\r\nre important and useful than trying to be oversmart with the choice of mant=\r\nra, day etc and impress god.\n&gt; \n&gt;               *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt;   =\r\n            One more thing. We have many mantras given by rishis, but the g=\r\nuidelines from rishis like Parasara on how to pick a mantra based on the ho=\r\nroscope are very limited. Astrologers today do not operate solely based on =\r\nthem. They use all kinds of other rules coming from various traditions. The=\r\ny are not free from corruption and imperfection. Most scriptures associate =\r\nvarious mantras with various results, irrespective of horoscope. For exampl=\r\ne, irrespective of who is the 6th lord and 8th lord and lord of A6 and A8, =\r\nRina Vimochaka Angaraka mantra is good for debt control. And so on. Linking=\r\n of horoscope is overplayed by today&#39;s astrologers, way beyond the scope of=\r\n Parasara&#39;s guidelines.\n&gt; \n&gt;               If one has a sadguru, I recommen=\r\nd following the word of sadguru rather than that of an astrology theoretici=\r\nan.\n&gt; \n&gt;               If not, there is no foolproof way to know the right =\r\npath. Pick any path (given by an astrologer or one that you feel attracted =\r\nto) instead of wasting time and then keep working on your attitude. The lat=\r\nter is the key. As I said earlier, learn to be a humble beggar at god&#39;s doo=\r\nr. Choice of Mantra is secondary and attitude is primary. If you succeed in=\r\n being a really humble beggar, you stand a better chance of success than gr=\r\neat scholars.\n&gt; \n&gt;               Any prasiddha mantra (e.g. ashtakshari, pa=\r\nnchakshari, dwadasakshari, navakshari, vishnu sahasranaam, rudram, hare kri=\r\nshna maha mantra, chandipath, ganapati atharva seersham, mrityunjaya mantra=\r\n etc) can help one make progress if one develops the right attitude. Withou=\r\nt the right attitude, even an impeaccably picked mantra will do nothing.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt;               *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt;               I hope this suffici=\r\nently clarifies my stand.

This sounds like another astrolo=\r\nger I had known some time back whose statements like this coerced me to wri=\r\nte Vedic Remedies in Astrology so that people are not misled but such prete=\r\nxts to knowledge.\n&gt; \n&gt;                 Statement 2 is an arrogance that the=\r\n entire mantra shastra is useless and the Rishi=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s we=\r\nre wasting time in giving so many mantras for the same devata, like say tho=\r\nusands of mantras for Vishnu or Hanuman when any one mantra would suffice. =\r\nOR it is like saying that we can take paracetamol and pray that cancer is c=\r\nured. I think I may have to write a book on Mantra Shastra to validate the =\r\nteachings of the vedic seers.\n&gt; \n&gt;                 I think there is somethi=\r\nng wrong in the way you are saying what you want to say.

The basic point is that Upapada is a rashi and carries energy\n&gt;    =\r\n             &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of Vara or day. If you fast on the day ruled by tithi o=\r\nf the 2nd\n&gt;                 &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; lord, you are bringing the jala energy t=\r\no vara, and gandanta may\n&gt;                 &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; occur, and spouse may com=\r\ne into a danger. So, what is the way out.\n&gt;                 &gt; \n&gt;           =\r\n      &gt; Why does a rashi carry the energy of vaara only and not that of the=\r\n tithi???? Why does rashi represent vaara or fire?\n&gt;                 &gt; \n&gt;  =\r\n               &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Because Raashi were created by Surya and fo=\r\nr doing so Surya took 12 forms called the Dvadasa Aditya...Narasimha you as=\r\nk this?? What is happening?\n&gt;                 &gt; \n&gt;                 &gt; After =\r\nall, Rudra rules over the element of fire and Gouri rules over the element =\r\nof water and one worships Gouri at the time of marriage. Moreover, Venus (w=\r\nater) is the karaka for marriage. So one could even say that UL/marriage is=\r\n represented by water element and fasting on UL lord&#39;s tithi brings the ele=\r\nment of water (prosperity and well-being) to one&#39;s marriage (UL)? One could=\r\n even say that fasting on the weekday of UL lord should be prohibited as it=\r\n brings the fire element represented by weekday to the water of UL and caus=\r\nes &quot;gandanta&quot;!\n&gt;                 &gt; \n&gt;                 &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] UL i=\r\ns the Maya and is associated with the Raashi Narasimha. It is the 12L which=\r\n is the creator of the UL...just as the mother Gouri creates everything thr=\r\nough the shakti of the graha, all the arudha are created by her due to the =\r\nlordships of the planets. So fasting on the tithi lorded by the 12th lord w=\r\nill be a *more correct* answer.\n&gt;                 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt;                 [Narasimha] We always say that houses (truth) are repre=\r\nsented by Sun (aatman) and arudha padas (maya) by Moon (mind).\n&gt; \n&gt;        =\r\n         Thus, 12th house is the actual creator and UL is the apparent crea=\r\ntor in the field of maya. Houses (truth) should actually be associated with=\r\n Sun (aatman) and Shiva (and not Gouri), while arudha padas (perception) sh=\r\nould actually be associated with Moon (mind) and Gouri. After all, that is =\r\nwhat we do in the tripod method in dasa judgment.\n&gt; \n&gt;                 Thus=\r\n, it is actually more logical to say that 12th house and 12th lord imbibe t=\r\nhe agni tattva of Sun and UL and UL lord imbibe the jala tattva of Moon.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt;                 Is the above &quot;*more correct* answer&quot; based on your own t=\r\nhinking or is it from a classic or from tradition?\n&gt; \n&gt;                 &lt;&lt;&lt;=\r\n&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n&gt;               &gt; The mantra one meditates with at =\r\nthe end of a day&#39;s fasting is far more effective than at other times. The c=\r\nonservation of energy otherwise spent on digestion or speech will enable fa=\r\nr more effective mantra meditation. So fast or keep mouna and then meditate=\r\n with a mantra, to maximize the effect of the mantra.\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n              &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I do not agree with this. Correct eating is =\r\nthe best blessing for good mantra practise. On days when one fasts the mind=\r\n is troubled by hunger causing the stomach to burn and churn and this distu=\r\nrbs mantra japa. Correct eating (alpa aahaara) is many many times better th=\r\nan complete fasting.\n&gt; \n&gt;               &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;       =\r\n        [Narasimha] Well, if one cannot fast, then one is destined to expen=\r\nd some energy on digestion after all and not focus all energy on the mantra=\r\n. But the bottomline is that shastras say that one should meditate either w=\r\nithout or with very little food (niraahaaro mitaahaaro). In any case, I hop=\r\ne we agree that meditation sessions after heavy eating are heavily restrain=\r\ned in effectiveness.\n&gt; \n&gt;               &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n&gt;       =\r\n        &gt; Seriously, however, this kind of stretching of gandanta concepts =\r\nis quite illogical.\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt;               &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] It =\r\nis not stretching ... it is the very definition of gandanta =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=\r\n=E2=80=9C the interface between fire and water. Put a burning match in a gl=\r\nass of water, the fire dies...There are other Ganda=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2=\r\ns in the chart but they are not anta (ends). Take Chitra ganda between Kany=\r\na and Tula.\n&gt; \n&gt;               &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;               [=\r\nNarasimha] Putting a burning match in a glass of water does indeed kill fir=\r\ne. But the question is of contact. If I am thinking of fire in my mind whil=\r\ne standing in water, it does not kill the fire. There is no contact.\n&gt; \n&gt;  =\r\n             My point is that the examples given have no real identifiable =\r\ncontact between water and fire.\n&gt; \n&gt;               One can be creative and =\r\ncome up with a lot of theories. For example, one can say that Moon and Venu=\r\ns are jala tattva and all rasis show agni tattva (then why are some rasis m=\r\narked as agni rasis and some as water rasis etc) and hence the sign occupie=\r\nd by Moon and Venus cause contact between water and fire. Then one can say =\r\nfasting on the weekdays of the dispositors of Moon and Venus causes gandant=\r\na and serious danger.\n&gt; \n&gt;               It is not enough to show some fire=\r\n and some water. See what counts as contact. Otherwise, one will engage in =\r\nillogical extrapolations.\n&gt; \n&gt;               &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n&gt;  =\r\n             &gt; Three years back you said you are leaving jyotish....then ag=\r\nain you told me two years back and again recently that you are leaving jyot=\r\nish. Now it is getting very evident that *jyotish is leaving you*. The know=\r\nledge of Jyotish is PERFECT =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C individuals embody it =\r\nin different levels of their understanding and intelligence. \n&gt; \n&gt;         =\r\n      &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;               [Narasimha] Nothing is per=\r\nmanent. What is one&#39;s cannot be taken away. And one cannot cling on to what=\r\n is not one&#39;s. Some rejoice when it seems like something comes and cry when=\r\n it seems like something leaves. Some impassionately observe as things seem=\r\n to come and go and do what they see as their dharma with the things they s=\r\neem to have.\n&gt; \n&gt;               Just a factual correction though\n&gt;         =\r\n      : I never said I was leaving Jyotish. For a few years after my spirit=\r\nual master entered my life, my interest in other things went down (though I=\r\n continued to do other things) and my focus on spiritual sadhana intensifie=\r\nd. So I said that my interest in Jyotish was very low. However, my guru gav=\r\ne me a task later. He wanted me to study the teachings of Parasara independ=\r\nently, meditate on them and share my interpretations with the world. He sai=\r\nd I was very passionate in my Jyotish activities earlier, and he wanted me =\r\nto do the same now but dispassionately and without an attachment. He felt t=\r\nhat I still have a contribution to make to Jyotish and wants me to do it as=\r\n an unattached karma. His word is everything for me.\n&gt; \n&gt;               Wha=\r\nt I told you recently is not that I was leaving Jyotish but what I said abo=\r\nve.\n&gt; \n&gt;               However, if your judgment is correct and if Jyotish =\r\nis indeed &quot;leaving&quot; me, I am sure my spiritual guru will realize it sooner =\r\nor later and change his command to me.\n&gt; \n&gt;               &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quot=\r\ne &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n&gt;               &gt; I can categorically declare one thing with utmo=\r\nst confidence. You pick any weekday or tithi and take a vow to fast or do m=\r\nouna vrata (remain silent) on that weekday or tithi and meditate with a par=\r\nticular mantra (any) at the end of the day. You can take a vow to keep that=\r\n practice for a certain duration of time (say, a few months or years) for a=\r\n specific purpose. Take a vow and keep the vrata for the duration. If brahm=\r\nacharya can be kept for the duration of the vrata, there is nothing like it=\r\n!\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt;               &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] This is a fine  state=\r\nment but then you seem to be saying that the Puranas and other teachings of=\r\n the seers is of not much relevance. Of course you are right as it will be =\r\nspiritually beneficial. For example, a person wishing to marry should not f=\r\nast on UL days and should choose any day (all days are the same) or any tit=\r\nhi (all tithi are the same) and start fasting and do a mantra (any mantra!!=\r\n) and then in a few days, or (maybe) a few months (or maybe) a few years ..=\r\n. or maybe (what you did not say), a few lifetimes, the marriage will happe=\r\nn! I cannot say you are wrong, so I agree that what you say is right.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n              &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;               [Narasimha] This i=\r\ns a gross exaggeration.\n&gt; \n&gt;               Is all that is being taught and =\r\npracticed now strictly from &quot;Puranas and other teachings of the seers&quot;?\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt;               I did not say all days and tithis are the same. Of course, =\r\nthere is some difference. But, it is not as big as being made here.\n&gt; \n&gt;   =\r\n            To make khoa, whether one uses cow milk or buffalo milk or milk=\r\n of a brown cow or a black cow or a Jersey cow or another cow does make som=\r\ne difference. But it is secondary. To say that &quot;danger&quot; and &quot;serious doshas=\r\n&quot; (see the quoted mails for such claims) can be caused by a wrong choice is=\r\n wrong. To say that a wrong choice means khoa will take 100 years to make i=\r\ns also a gross exaggeration.\n&gt; \n&gt;               The main thing is that you =\r\nneed milk and sugar. If one is confused by endless claims of khoa making co=\r\nnsultants and ends up not making khoa at all, that will be sad. In such a c=\r\nase, one can simply pick some milk or the other, take sugar and start cooki=\r\nng khoa. It will take an extra half hour, but the job will be done.\n&gt; \n&gt;   =\r\n            I request Jyotishis to behave responsibly and humbly and not en=\r\ngage in scare-mongering and say that a speicifc austerity (fasting on a spe=\r\ncific weekday or tithi in a chart) can cause &quot;danger&quot; and &quot;serious doshas&quot;.=\r\n No wonder some spiritual teachers look down upon Jyotish and dismiss it. S=\r\nuch unbalanced attitude and self-importance from us does not help our cause=\r\n!\n&gt; \n&gt;               Yes, Jyotish is helpful, but let us not oversell it or=\r\n overplay the importance...\n&gt; \n&gt;               &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n&gt;=\r\n               &gt; Gem stones may harm when used incorrectly. But, austeritie=\r\ns like prayers, fasting, mouna vrata and brahmacharya will NEVER do you any=\r\n harm. If your body can take fasting, you can do it on any weekday or tithi=\r\n without too many calculations.\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt;               &gt; [Sanja=\r\ny Rath:] Brahmacharya is good for someone planning to have a baby or one wh=\r\no cannot conceive and this is kept for some period before the appointed dat=\r\ne of nisheka. Brahmacharya is good for marriage?! I think you are mistaking=\r\n abstinence from physical union as Brahmacharya. Oh no its so different.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt;               &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;               [Narasimha] Of =\r\ncourse, brahmacharya is much more, but also very difficult for most. Even p=\r\nhysical celibacy is a good enough austerity. Physical celibacy over an exte=\r\nnded period of time increases the efficacy of other austerities such as fas=\r\nting, mouna vrata, meditation and homam.\n&gt; \n&gt;               Best regards,\n&gt;=\r\n               Narasimha\n&gt;               ----------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------\n&gt;               Do a Short Homam Yourself:=\r\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;               Do Pitri Tarpanas You=\r\nrself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;               Spirituality:=\r\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;               Free Jyotish le=\r\nssons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;               Free Jyotis=\r\nh software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;               Sri Ja=\r\ngannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;               -=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------- \n&gt;       =\r\n         \n&gt;               --- In sohamsa@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Sanjay Rath&quot; &lt;sj=\r\nrath@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;               &gt;\n&gt;               &gt; om paramesthi gurave nama=\r\nh\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt;               &gt; Dear Narasimha\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n              &gt; Just added a few thoughts and questions since we are on the=\r\n topic of spirituality, which is not my forte.

It is funny that I should be=\r\n typing this email on an Ekadashi day, when many Vaishnavas fast irrespecti=\r\nve of their horoscopes.\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt;               &gt; [Sanjay Rath:]=\r\n I write on dvadasi when so many vasihnava also fast and keep great austeri=\r\nties. J Any difference?\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt;               &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Here is m=\r\ny point and view about the question raised. 2nd bhava is\n&gt;               &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the bhava of Vishnu, sustainer, and if we fast on the day of UL in\n&gt;  =\r\n             &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 2nd house, we bring insult to Vishnu who provides the f=\r\nood for us.\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt;               &gt; My dear Zoran, please allo=\r\nw me to express my disagreement.\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt;               &gt; Auste=\r\nrities can never be seen as an insult to Vishnu. Self-deprivation of 2nd ho=\r\nuse matters such as food (fasting) or speech (mouna vrata - vow of silence)=\r\n are austerities. Giving up food or speech is not an insult to Vishnu just =\r\nas giving up sex (i.e. brahmacharya) is not an insult to Sukracharya (Venus=\r\n).\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt;               &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I though Brahma was =\r\nvery angry that his sons decided not to have progeny and stayed celibate. S=\r\no He created others. Why was Brahma angry when his sons remained celibate? =\r\nWhy should Sukracharya be angry if someone is celibate? How is it an insult=\r\n or not an insult to Sukracharya? You are taking planet signification of Ve=\r\nnus for 7H ...and linking this to creation process...which is wrong Narasim=\r\nha. Brahma is seen from lords of dusthana 6, 8 and 12 from lagna or 7th whi=\r\nch is....you know this.There is nothing wrong with the 7th house as it is n=\r\necessary for procreation. It is only the link of this with the Brahma graha=\r\n that causes it to become a serious shad-ripu. Married people are as eligib=\r\nle for moksha as unmarried ones and bachelors. It depends on the following =\r\nof dharma and ashrama.\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt;               &gt; Various gods be=\r\nstow various things on us, some at the gross physical level and some at the=\r\n subtle spiritual level. As we overcome our dependendency on gross things, =\r\nwe make progress at the subtle level.\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt;               &gt; =\r\nIf one eats food, a good amount of internal fire (and subtle internal energ=\r\ny associated with it) is used for digesting it and for generating physical =\r\nenergy from it. If one fasts, that subtle energy is unused and available fo=\r\nr other things. This is a tremendous benefit. As a result, one can better d=\r\nigest mantras and spiritual food available all around one.\n&gt;               =\r\n&gt; \n&gt;               &gt; The mantra one meditates with at the end of a day&#39;s fa=\r\nsting is far more effective than at other times. The conservation of energy=\r\n otherwise spent on digestion or speech will enable far more effective mant=\r\nra meditation. So fast or keep mouna and then meditate with a mantra, to ma=\r\nximize the effect of the mantra.\n&gt;               &gt; \n&gt;               &gt; [Sanj=\r\nay Rath:] I do not agree with this.
