You are quite ri=\r\nght....it is important to stay put inside the &#39;elevator&#39; until one reaches =\r\nthe final destination. I believe it is God&#39;s Grace alone that makes this po=\r\nssible, i.e. saves us from falling prey to temptations along the way. \n\nSad=\r\nhana and more sadhana....I agree. It is a long path, and is sometimes enjoy=\r\nable, and sometimes dreary (especially when the destination seems far away =\r\nbecause eliminating the six internal enemies seems so difficult)....but pes=\r\nervere we must. The sages say we are all destined for success one day or th=\r\ne other- a heartening thought.\n\nSpeaking of destiny, this is a quotation I =\r\nrecently came across that I really like.\n\n&quot;Destiny is not a matter of chanc=\r\ne; it is a matter of choice. It is not a thing to be waited for, it is a th=\r\ning to be achieved.&quot; \n \n-William Jennings Bryan\n\nOm Namo Narayanaya\n\nBest w=\r\nishes,\n\nAparna\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Ajit Krishnan &lt;aji=\r\nt.krishnan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Aparna,\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a city with many tall=\r\n skyscrapers. We are on the ground (or,\n&gt; perhaps underground). And our goa=\r\nl is to get onto the roof of one of\n&gt; these very tall buildings, which is a=\r\nbove the clouds. How do you get\n&gt; to the top?\n&gt; \n&gt; There are so many differ=\r\nent tall buildings. Each of these is like a\n&gt; religion. You may be more fam=\r\niliar with some of them, and others might\n&gt; look frightening. Inside, there=\r\n are so many different sets of\n&gt; elevators (paths of sadhana). Some of the =\r\nelevators will go slow, and\n&gt; some will go fast. Some will go all the way t=\r\no the top, and some will\n&gt; only go to specific floors.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once we are ins=\r\nide the elevator, we might enjoy so many sensations,\n&gt; like the acceleratio=\r\nn and deceleration of the elevator. We might like\n&gt; it so much that we forg=\r\net about getting to the top, and simply go up\n&gt; and down the elevator. The =\r\nelevator may stop at so many floors. Each\n&gt; floor is a tempation. From the =\r\nelevator, we may see many sights and\n&gt; hear many sounds. Again, we might fo=\r\nrget about our goal and get off\n&gt; the elevator.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the beginning, we h=\r\nave to be careful. We should stay on the\n&gt; elevator all the way to the top.=\r\n Anything else takes us away from our\n&gt; goal. But, at the end, we have to g=\r\net off the elevator. After all, the\n&gt; goal is to get to the top of the buil=\r\nding, and not to stay inside.\n&gt; Perhaps we have to take some stairs and ope=\r\nn some doors to get out\n&gt; onto the roof.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps you can think of each=\r\n of these tall building like a religion.\n&gt; Yes, they may appear to be an ob=\r\nstacle (after all, when you are inside\n&gt; the building, and inside an elevat=\r\nor, the sky is not at all visible).\n&gt; But, the quickest and safest way to g=\r\net to the roof is to go inside,\n&gt; and take an elevator to the top.\n&gt; \n&gt; Som=\r\ne people may advise a more direct path, always keeping the goal in\n&gt; sight.=\r\n They may say that you should directly climb the outside of the\n&gt; building.=\r\n They may be technically correct, but this path is not for\n&gt; everyone.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n From a practical point of view, the answer is simple -- do sadhana and\n&gt; m=\r\nore sadhana. Do it inside of your religious construct if it helps\n&gt; you. Ig=\r\nnore the religious constructs when they become an obstacle.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are =\r\nso many mails on this list.

Lately I realized this is literally true=\r\n. Heavy psychological constructs are created by religions to protect an ave=\r\nrage person from the real experience of God, which is so powerful and overw=\r\nhelming that if and when it happens, it can effectively cause a hurricane i=\r\nn your average life and pretty much destroy all your well laid plans.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I will briefly narrate a true and interesting incident.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; An individual - say X - had gone to Vrindavan to stay there for some =\r\nyears. He was sitting at a satsang of a famous sadhu, enjoying the discours=\r\ne, when a ragged looking man, with piercing unblinking eyes, comes over and=\r\n asks for food. The sadhu who was lecturing at the satsang, stopped and ord=\r\nered someone to bring some sweets for the ragged looking man. Then he did a=\r\n pranam to the man and said, &quot;Maharaj, please tell us some words of God&quot;. T=\r\nhe man became angry, and retorted back, &quot;Why? Why waste time talking of God=\r\n, no one wants God anyway. If God comes, all will run away. So please conti=\r\nnue with your lectures as you were doing before I came in&quot;. Everyone became=\r\n uncomfortably silent hearing this. Meanwhile the sweets came, the man took=\r\n a sweet into his mouth, looked up at the sky and then got up and started w=\r\nalking off. After he went out, the Sadhu who was lecturing, looked at his f=\r\nollowers and said, &quot;He is a sadhu who comes to Vrindavan once in a while,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;  but he has probably lost his mental balance due to smoking too much ga=\r\nnja&quot;. Now X, who was sitting there, for some weird reason felt attracted to=\r\n that ragged man and went out to see where the guy was going. As he approac=\r\nhed the ragged looking man, the man turned around and spoke to X in clear E=\r\nnglish, &quot;Hello, I was waiting for you to come and join me.&quot; X was of course=\r\n taken aback, did not expect the man to speak in English and more over he h=\r\nad no clue how the man got to know that he knew English (X was dressed in t=\r\nhe garb of a sadhu - saffron clothes).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The man continued, &quot;M=\r\ny name is Mr Iyengar. I was born near Chennai, was an Engineer by professio=\r\nn, but left home long back and have been a wondering sadhu since then.&quot; X a=\r\nsked him, why did you derive the sadhu who was doing the satsang? Mr Iyenga=\r\nr replied, &quot;All this is bogus. Actually this God thing itself is source of =\r\nall confusion. No one has a clue. Not the hordes of Sadhus, not ordinary fo=\r\nlks, really no one. And God is the reason for all the religious troubles an=\r\nd other nonsense.&quot; X felt a little irritated, &quot;Why do you have so much bitt=\r\nerness about religion/God/sadhus etc? If you have been a sadhu for long, th=\r\nen how come you haven&#39;t met a single genuine sadhu yet, how is it possible?=\r\n&quot;. Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;Well if I take Vrindavan alone, there is only one g=\r\nenuine man here, rest are all as confused as anybody else, merely different=\r\n degrees of confusion. But you cannot meet that man, he is not accessible t=\r\no others.&quot; Mr Iyengar continued, &quot;The root of\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  all this problem is thi=\r\ns God business. Know it for certain, that man cannot know God ever. What is=\r\n infinite is beyond the capacity of the human brain to comprehend. At best =\r\na man will only imagine a magnified man or a magnified woman with super-pow=\r\ners. If the individual keeps doing sadhana, one day he will create this for=\r\nm by a projection of his own mind, and he may even acquire supernatural abi=\r\nlities from this form, and generally be regarded by others as a man of god.=\r\n But God is beyond this. That is why I say the root of the problem is tryin=\r\ng to understand the infinite with a finite mind and then stressing that one=\r\n has understood correctly.&quot; While talking, the sadhu stopped at a small tea=\r\n-stall and bought some ganja, and in one pull finished off the chillum. The=\r\nn held the smoke in a kumbaka for about 5 minutes, slowly releasing the smo=\r\nke in small bits. Then he continued, &quot;You (meaning X) are a young man. Have=\r\n a clear mind in your head, don&#39;t get\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  confused by all these show of s=\r\npirituality you see in holy places. When I was your age, I did a lot of ter=\r\nrible mistakes in the impetuousness of youth. I was an infamous young man i=\r\nn the locality of Chennai where I grew up. But then one day having nothing =\r\nbetter to do, I left home. After roaming for 3 decades, I slowly realized w=\r\nhat God really is and how to interact with this thing.&quot; As he spoke he reac=\r\nhed a two storied house, and a man, woman and a young girl came out of the =\r\nhouse. They invited him inside and Mr Iyengar inturn said to X, you too com=\r\ne inside, these people love me a lot so when I come to Vrindavan I stay at =\r\ntheir house. I will show you something interesting if you join me.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; After an hour inside the house, X was feeling very bored and irritat=\r\ned. The woman was bringing different fruits and sweets for their food while=\r\n the young girl was massaging Mr Iyengar&#39;s feet as he lay down on a cot, en=\r\njoying the hospitality. X thought this man is one more fraud, he abuses eve=\r\nryone else but has no qualms about shamelessly accepting the hospitality of=\r\n a householder and enjoying a good life. As soon as this thought crossed hi=\r\ns mind, he saw that the man and the woman and the girl=C2  stood up and wit=\r\nh folded hands were bowing down towards the cot where Mr Iyengar was lying =\r\ndown. X was sitting on the floor, facing the opp direction to the cot. He t=\r\noo turned round to see what was going on. What he saw made his jaw drop ope=\r\nn in shock. Instead of the old, bald, ragged beggar that was Mr Iyengar, th=\r\nere sat on the cot a young man, who looked in his early twenties, whose who=\r\nle skin was dazzlingly fair, emanating a brilliant glow that lightened up t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  whole room. He had a shaved head, four arms, holding lotus and wea=\r\npons, with enchantingly beautiful eyes! It looked not a human being any mor=\r\ne but a god sitting in place of what was even five minutes back only a frai=\r\nl, dirty-looking Mr Iyengar.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; X did not know what was happeni=\r\nng. He saw the young man gestured towards him to stand up and come near the=\r\n cot. Like being hypnotized, X got up and walked upto the cot and the young=\r\n man embraced him and X lost all consciousness. When he woke up, he saw he =\r\nwas near a temple, in a remote location with trees and shrubs all around. O=\r\nld Mr Iyengar was nearby, held his hand and took him inside the temple prec=\r\nincts. There he saw a dhuni burning, and next to it an old man, naked, sitt=\r\ning in meditation with ash all over his body. Mr Iyengar did not say a word=\r\n, pointed out that meditating man to him and then took X out of the temple.=\r\n That is the man I was talking about, he said. You should meet him tomorrow=\r\n. He is the only one in Vrindavan currently who has an idea what God really=\r\n means. After providing directions of how to reach that desolate temple, Mr=\r\n Iyengar hugged X again and immediately he felt he was losing awareness of =\r\nplace/time and lapsed into\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  unconsciousness again.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; When=\r\n X woke up, he was in the room in that house, lying on the floor. Mr Iyenga=\r\nr was on the bed, his old, ragged self, with a mischievous smile on his fac=\r\ne. Next day, X went to the temple as directed.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n =C2 Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt; awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmab=\r\nuddhayah |\n&gt; &gt;&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  From: Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.kris=\r\nhnan@&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sent: Monday, 23 July 201=\r\n2 8:13 AM\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] To those who say that they don=\r\n=E2=80=99t believe in any religion\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Dear Prasanth,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; To those who say that they don=E2=80=99t believe in any religion=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; In general, many of those who don&#39;t believe in re=\r\nligion or God are being more honest than those who do. After all, most peop=\r\nle who believe in God look at him as a limited being to barter with. All of=\r\n our biases and assumptions are most apparent when dealing with our Gods. O=\r\nften, religion has simply served to formalize these biases.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; While=\r\n being mired in this word of duality, we think that an ounce of insincere p=\r\nrayer can undo the whole weight of &quot;paapa&quot; that we engage in throughout the=\r\n day. And we lay this bias on our God. No wonder that others look at all th=\r\ne suffering in the world and laugh at this concept of God. We &quot;God believer=\r\ns&quot; are the culprit.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; We all have plenty of paapa and punya in our =\r\nkarmic pipeline. Instead of asking for the strength to be steadfast while w=\r\ne reap both kinds of fruits, we ask God to burn &quot;paapa&quot; and leave the &quot;puny=\r\na&quot; intact. It is us &quot;God believers&quot; who look at our lives, ignoring all the=\r\n &quot;paapa phala&quot;. We look at one or two instances of &quot;punya phala&quot; and declar=\r\ne our prayers to be successful. However, an impartial observer sees it for =\r\nwhat it is, and laughs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n For the most part, our bhakti is weak. When we are engaged in spiritual pr=\r\nactices, our bhakti is particularly weak, and we count the seconds and minu=\r\ntes. When engaged in worldly pursuits, our bhakti is strong, and time reall=\r\ny flies. And yet, we expect God to reward our weak spiritual bhakti and ign=\r\nore our strong worldly bhakti. An impartial observer sees it for what it is=\r\n, and laughs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The best =\r\nway to bring about new waves of bhakti is not to look at the &quot;non-believers=\r\n&quot; and try to convert them. All we have to do is try to eliminate our lack o=\r\nf belief, and be honest with ourselves. If we can transform ourselves, the =\r\nworld will be served.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If we see God as the limitless power that h=\r\ne is, he is difficult to define. It is difficult to capture him within a re=\r\nligion. Religion should see itself as a stepping-stone, and should ask each=\r\n of us to _eventually_ place our feet on top of it to reach the higher goal=\r\ns. Unfortunately, most religions ask us to accept them without question. Th=\r\ney ask us to place our heads on them with reverence, and try to prevent the=\r\n spiritually advanced from going any farther.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sasneham,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C2\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C2  =C2 ajit\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -------------=\r\n-----------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; || Om Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih ||\n&gt; &gt; Yah=\r\noo!
