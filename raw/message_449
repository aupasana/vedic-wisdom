Swami Yogananda is =\r\none of the sixteen monastic disciples of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, along wit=\r\nh Swami Vivekananda. He was forced to marry, but never slept with his own w=\r\nife. Swami Vivekananda once said &quot;if any of us (disciples of Ramakrishna) c=\r\nonquered lust completely and in all respects, it is Joginder (Swami Yoganan=\r\nda)&quot;. There is no question of Swami Yogananda being accused of drinking and=\r\n having women etc.\n \nParamahamsa Yogananda is a sishya of Yukteshwar Mahara=\r\nj and from the lineage of Mahavatar Babaji. They practice kriya yoga. I do =\r\nnot know much about him.\n \n*         *         *\n \nThe link you gave is abo=\r\nut neither Swami Yogananda nor Paramahamsa Yogananda, but some propaganda a=\r\nbout Ramakrishna Paramahamsa himself, based on some bali he apparently gave=\r\n.

Rao&quot; &lt;pvr=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:\n    =EF=BB=BF \n    Namaste,\n\n    I meant it figurative=\r\nly.\n\n    For the reference on Yogananda, you can read the section on Swami =\r\nYogananda in &quot;God Lived with Them: Life Stories of Sixteen Monastic Discipl=\r\nes of Sri Ramakrishna&quot; by Swami Chetanananda.\n\n    *        *        *\n\n   =\r\n There have been many great yogis, babas, saints and swamis in the last few=\r\n thousand years of Kali yuga. But Ramakrishna Paramahamsa stands out in one=\r\n way. He is one master who mastered every single path. He mastered bhakti y=\r\noga, jnaana yoga, karma yoga and even raaja yoga. He worshipped and experie=\r\nnced Rama, Krishna, Kaali and several forms. He even reached the state of n=\r\nirvikalpa samadhi, where there is no &quot;experience&quot;. He was in sahaja samadhi=\r\n always. He was able induce tremendous experience in people by mere touch o=\r\nr mere look. Yet he was simple like a child and had zero ego (that is why h=\r\ne could do all that!!!).\n\n    Many &quot;gurus&quot; force their dharma on their sish=\r\nyas and have no ability to recognize the true nature and dharma of each sis=\r\nhya. They force sishyas to chant the mantra they chant, worship the form th=\r\ney worship and walk the path they walk. Ramakrishna had deep insight into t=\r\nhe true nature of each sishya and gave specific instructions. He taught tot=\r\nally different mantras, totally different forms and totally different paths=\r\n to different sishyas. He even taught contradictory things to different sis=\r\nhyas. When one sishya who needed to mend his aggressive attitude roughed up=\r\n somebody for insulting his guru, he scolded &quot;shame on you. With your attit=\r\nude, you did not defend your guru, but brought shame to him. You should lea=\r\nrn to be calm and ignore such insults. THAT will place your guru in a good =\r\nstead and not your aggression&quot;. When another sishya who needed to mend his =\r\nsoft demeanor ignored insults of Ramakrishna by some people and came away s=\r\nilently, he scolded him &quot;shame on you. Shastras say that you should kill on=\r\ne who insults your guru. How can you ignore such wrong behavior? You should=\r\n give them a piece of your mind.&quot;\n\n    Spiritual sadhana does not mean just=\r\n chanting a mantra or repeating a procedure everyday for a certain period o=\r\nf time. Spiritual sadhana is a continuous process by which one transforms o=\r\nneself from inside out and purifies oneself. That way, every action and eve=\r\nry thought becomes a sadhana and offers an opportunity for introspection an=\r\nd transformation of internal attitude.\n\n    Anyway, coming back to the poin=\r\nt, Ramakrishna is not a normal sadhaka or a normal guru. He belonged to a v=\r\nery special class of sadhakas and he was an exceptional guru to an exceptio=\r\nnal group of sishyas.\n\n    Without his [indirect] blessings, I would be a n=\r\nobody and would be lower than dirt. I would not be able to say anything int=\r\nelligent or meaningful in spiritual matters. Those who are impressed/inspir=\r\ned by something I write should be thankful to my guru Dr Manish Pandit and =\r\nto Sri Ramakrishna for showering their grace using me as an instrument and =\r\nnot to me.\n\n    BTW, you are all free to forward my posts that you like to =\r\npeople who may be interested in spiritual discussions. I have no problem. A=\r\ns I said before, I am a servant distributing the wealth of a king (Mother) =\r\nas asked by the minister (my guru).\n\n    Best regards,\n    Narasimha\n    --=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n    Do a S=\r\nhort Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n    Do Pitri Tarp=\r\nanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n    Spirituality: htt=\r\np://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): htt=\r\np://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n    Free Jyotish software (Windows): http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAstrologer.org\n    Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www=\r\n.SriJagannath.org\n    -----------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------- \n\n      ----- Original Message ----- \n      From: rajarshi na=\r\nndy \n      To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n      Sent: Sunday, September =\r\n28, 2008 2:44 PM\n      Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Dharma\n\n            =\r\nDear Narasimhaji\n\n            Another wonderly inspired post by you!!!!\n\n  =\r\n          I did not understand one line of your post.

Krishna clearly says in \n              Bhagavad Geeta &quot;Follow =\r\nyour own dharma. It is dangerous to follow someone \n              else&#39;s dh=\r\narma&quot;.\n\n              Following the path of dharma basically means engaging=\r\n in the right \n              action/duty. Right action varies from person t=\r\no person, from time to time \n              and from place to place. It is d=\r\nependent on what nature expects from you, \n              which in turn is b=\r\nased on who you have been in the past, what actions you \n              did =\r\nin the past while identifying with the action, who you affected in the \n   =\r\n           past (and how) with the actions that you identified with, what d=\r\nebts you \n              created in the process, and what mental tendencies =\r\nyou accumulated until \n              now.\n\n              If, based on one&#39;s=\r\n mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person \n              t=\r\no kill evil persons, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s mental \n=\r\n              tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread =\r\nthe message of \n              uniformity of all religions, that becomes one=\r\n&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s \n              mental tendencies and karmic d=\r\nebts, nature wants a person to spread the \n              ritual of homam in=\r\n the world, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s \n              me=\r\nntal tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to make a lot of \n =\r\n             money and construct a temple, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.\n\n    =\r\n          * * *\n\n              The dharma of a being may change from one li=\r\nfe to another.\n\n              At the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna=\r\n&#39;s dharma to kill his gurus, \n              elders and relatives. The time =\r\nthen was such that there was too much weight \n              on earth and na=\r\nture wanted earth to be relieved of some weight. Tremendous \n              =\r\ndestruction was to take place and civilization destroyed to a great extent,=\r\n \n              to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna being =\r\na great warrior, \n              it was his dharma to facilitate that. Some =\r\npeople he deeply loved and \n              respected were on the other side =\r\nand it was his dharma to kill them.\n\n              When the same Arjuna was=\r\n born again in the 19th century as one of \n              Ramakrishna Parama=\r\nhamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a \n              previ=\r\nous life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different in this \n   =\r\n           new time and place. He was born to renounce material life despit=\r\ne his \n              aristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a =\r\nmonk and inspire \n              generations to embrace a simple life of men=\r\ntal detachment and service to \n              others. When he is born again =\r\n(which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna \n              said), his dharma =\r\nbased on the time and place may be something else.\n\n              * * *\n\n  =\r\n            The tricky question is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s dharm=\r\na?\n\n              Some people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;foll=\r\now your own dharma \n              and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the lig=\r\nht of castism. Though the concept \n              of caste (varna) has been =\r\nthere in Hinduism for a long time, the concept of \n              caste mobi=\r\nlity was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by \n              =\r\nkilling birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was a=\r\n \n              kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a brahmana and and=\r\n a maharshi \n              later. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One=\r\n starts off with the varna \n              of father, because that is what o=\r\nne is exposed to in childhood. As one \n              develops in life, one =\r\ngets one&#39;s own varna based on what one does.\n\n              Thus, the misin=\r\nterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to know your \n             =\r\n dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas in=\r\n \n              the world. Each person has individual dharma.\n\n            =\r\n  Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very very very difficult. If one is pure =\r\n\n              enough, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us hav=\r\ne a part of our \n              mind that tells us what our dharma is, but i=\r\nt is surrounded by a lot of \n              noise from other parts of our mi=\r\nnds which tell other things. Thus, we get \n              confused.\n\n       =\r\n       We should make the best judgment combining discrimination and intuit=\r\nion and \n              decide what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. W=\r\ne may be err, but doing \n              the best we can is all that we can d=\r\no!\n\n              More than following dharma, what is of utmost importance =\r\nis to engage in \n              actions without identification. *That* alone=\r\n ensures that we are not \n              accumulating new karmas, i.e. not i=\r\nncreasing the load. We should not build \n              too much attachment =\r\nto what we are doing. We should engage in the best \n              possible =\r\nactions (based on our best judgment on what our dharma in the given \n      =\r\n        situation is), with as little attachment and self-identification wi=\r\nth the \n              action as possible. When the action is finished, we s=\r\nhould leave the result \n              to god. We should not think &quot;I did it=\r\n&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it \n              work&quot; etc. Such adherenc=\r\ne of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through \n              untached action=\r\n) will simplify our ego and purify our consciousness slowly. \n             =\r\n As we become purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma clearer=\r\n. \n              There is a positive feedback here. This will slowly enable=\r\n us to see our \n              dharma clearly and follow it without incurrin=\r\ng new karmas. This is not easy, \n              but not as difficult as peop=\r\nle think.\n\n              The bottomline is: Even if one is not following on=\r\ne&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense of \n              &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined =\r\nwith time if one engages in action with \n              little attachment.\n\n=\r\n              * * *\n\n              In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellec=\r\nt and intuition are the inputs. \n              Another external input is th=\r\ne words of scriptures and learned men. One can \n              derive one&#39;s =\r\ndharma from them. A special place is given to one&#39;s spiritual \n            =\r\n  master. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can take the words o=\r\nf \n              the master to determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincere=\r\nly.\n\n              When Arjuna was confused about what his dharma was and t=\r\nhought killing gurus \n              and relatives was not dharma, he had a =\r\nguru in Krishna who clarified his \n              dharma. When Narendranath =\r\n(Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dharma \n              and wanted=\r\n to renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do sadhana, \n         =\r\n     Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the ma=\r\nterial \n              world and do the work of Mother for him.\n\n           =\r\n   One who is not in tune with nature and does not know who one is, what on=\r\ne&#39;s \n              debts are and what nature expects from one can err in th=\r\ne judgment of what \n              one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elev=\r\nated soul with a clear insight into \n              one&#39;s inner core, such a=\r\n guru can give perfect guidance.\n\n              * * *\n\n              Bottom=\r\nline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles and \n       =\r\n       declare that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person=\r\n, from \n              time to time and from place to place. Also, there are=\r\n no thumbrules to find \n              out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one ca=\r\nn refine one&#39;s understanding of one&#39;s \n              dharma by increasing i=\r\nnternal purity. By doing various kinds of spiritual \n              sadhana =\r\n(like homam, japam etc) and engaging in actions without much \n             =\r\n attachment, one can slowly purify oneself and refine one&#39;s understanding o=\r\nf \n              one&#39;s individual dharma.\n\n              Best regards,\n    =\r\n          Narasimha\n              ------------ --------- --------- --------=\r\n- --------- --------- -\n              Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www=\r\n.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n              Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http=\r\n://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n              Spirituality: http://gro=\r\nups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n              Free Jyotish lessons (MP3=\r\n): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n              Free Jyotish software=\r\n (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n              Sri Jagannath Cen=\r\ntre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n              ------------ =\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n\n              ----- O=\r\nriginal Message ----- \n              From: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@ yaho=\r\no.co. in&gt;\n              To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n              =\r\nSent: Saturday, September 27, 2008 8:02 AM\n              Subject: [vedic-wi=\r\nsdom] Dharma\n\n              &gt; Namaste to all\n              &gt;\n              =\r\n&gt; i just finished my Aghora series\n              &gt; and in it in last part\n =\r\n             &gt; Vimalanda says path of dharma is very personal.\n            =\r\n  &gt; Can somebody share views on that and how can we approach\n              =\r\n&gt; towards it\n              &gt; Does it has to do something with vedas and upa=\r\nnishads\n              &gt;\n              &gt; regards\n              &gt; jitender\n\n =\r\n          \n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_00E4_01C921C4.8E009800\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;#ygrp-mkp {\n\tBORDER-RIGHT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; PAD=\r\nDING-RIGHT: 14px; BORDER-TOP: #d8d8d8 1px solid; PADDING-LEFT: 14px; PADDIN=\r\nG-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN: 14px 0px; BORDER-LEFT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; PADDING-TO=\r\nP: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: #d8d8d8 1px solid; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\n}\n#ygrp-mkp HR=\r\n {\n\tBORDER-RIGHT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; BORDER-TOP: #d8d8d8 1px solid; BORDER-=\r\nLEFT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #d8d8d8 1px solid\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #hd {=\r\n\n\tFONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 85%; MARGIN: 10px 0px; COLOR: #628c2a; LINE=\r\n-HEIGHT: 122%\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #ads {\n\tMARGIN-BOTTOM: 10px\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad {\n\tPA=\r\nDDING-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px\n=\r\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad A {\n\tCOLOR: #0000ff; TEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;MET=\r\nA content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3395&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=\r\n=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Dear Lakshmi,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial s=\r\nize=3D2&gt;The Yogananda I mentioned is different.

They force sishyas to chant the mantra they chant, worship =\r\nthe form \n    they worship and walk the path they walk. Ramakrishna had dee=\r\np insight into \n    the true nature of each sishya and gave specific instru=\r\nctions. He taught \n    totally different mantras, totally different forms a=\r\nnd totally different \n    paths to different sishyas. He even taught contra=\r\ndictory things to different \n    sishyas.

Krishna clearly says in &lt;BR&gt;Bhagavad Geeta &quot;Fo=\r\nllow your \n              own dharma. It is dangerous to follow someone &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nelse&#39;s \n              dharma&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Following the path of dharma basicall=\r\ny means \n              engaging in the right &lt;BR&gt;action/duty. Right action =\r\nvaries from \n              person to person, from time to time &lt;BR&gt;and from=\r\n place to place. \n              It is dependent on what nature expects from=\r\n you, &lt;BR&gt;which in turn \n              is based on who you have been in the=\r\n past, what actions you \n              &lt;BR&gt;did in the past while identifyin=\r\ng with the action, who you \n              affected in the &lt;BR&gt;past (and how=\r\n) with the actions that you \n              identified with, what debts you =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;created in the process, and \n              what mental tendencies you a=\r\nccumulated until &lt;BR&gt;now.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If, \n              based on one&#39;s mental t=\r\nendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a \n              person &lt;BR&gt;to kil=\r\nl evil persons, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, \n              based on one&#39;=\r\ns mental &lt;BR&gt;tendencies and karmic debts, nature \n              wants a per=\r\nson to spread the message of &lt;BR&gt;uniformity of all \n              religions=\r\n, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s \n              &lt;BR&gt;mental t=\r\nendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to \n              spread =\r\nthe &lt;BR&gt;ritual of homam in the world, that becomes one&#39;s \n              dha=\r\nrma. If, based on one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;mental tendencies and karmic debts, \n          =\r\n    nature wants a person to make a lot of &lt;BR&gt;money and construct a \n     =\r\n         temple, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The dharma =\r\n\n              of a being may change from one life to another.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At th=\r\ne time \n              of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma to kill hi=\r\ns gurus, \n              &lt;BR&gt;elders and relatives. The time then was such th=\r\nat there was \n              too much weight &lt;BR&gt;on earth and nature wanted =\r\nearth to be \n              relieved of some weight. Tremendous &lt;BR&gt;destruct=\r\nion was to take \n              place and civilization destroyed to a great =\r\nextent, &lt;BR&gt;to welcome \n              Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Ar=\r\njuna being a great warrior, \n              &lt;BR&gt;it was his dharma to facilit=\r\nate that. Some people he deeply \n              loved and &lt;BR&gt;respected were=\r\n on the other side and it was his \n              dharma to kill them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;When the same Arjuna was born again in \n              the 19th century as=\r\n one of &lt;BR&gt;Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas \n              (Swami Yogana=\r\nnda had been Arjuna in a &lt;BR&gt;previous life, according \n              to Ram=\r\nakrishna) , his dharma was different in this &lt;BR&gt;new time \n              an=\r\nd place. He was born to renounce material life despite his \n              &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;aristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and \n        =\r\n      inspire &lt;BR&gt;generations to embrace a simple life of mental \n         =\r\n     detachment and service to &lt;BR&gt;others. When he is born again (which \n  =\r\n            he has to, as per what Ramakrishna &lt;BR&gt;said), his dharma based =\r\non \n              the time and place may be something else.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The \n              tricky question is: How does one decide what is one=\r\n&#39;s \n              dharma?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s wor=\r\nds saying \n              &quot;follow your own dharma &lt;BR&gt;and not someone else&#39;s=\r\n dharma&quot; in the \n              light of castism. Though the concept &lt;BR&gt;of =\r\ncaste (varna) has been \n              there in Hinduism for a long time, th=\r\ne concept of &lt;BR&gt;caste \n              mobility was very much there. Valmiki=\r\n was a shudra who lived by \n              &lt;BR&gt;killing birds. He became a br=\r\nahmana and a maharshi later. \n              Vishwamitra was a &lt;BR&gt;kshatrita=\r\n and a powerful king. He became a \n              brahmana and and a maharsh=\r\ni &lt;BR&gt;later. Basically varna shows one&#39;s \n              aptitude. One start=\r\ns off with the varna &lt;BR&gt;of father, because \n              that is what one=\r\n is exposed to in childhood. As one &lt;BR&gt;develops \n              in life, on=\r\ne gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one \n              does.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thus, =\r\nthe misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which \n              tells you to =\r\nknow your &lt;BR&gt;dharma from your caste is wrong. \n              Moreover, the=\r\nre are not just 4 dharmas in &lt;BR&gt;the world. Each \n              person has =\r\nindividual dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is \n              is ve=\r\nry very very difficult. If one is pure &lt;BR&gt;enough, one will \n              =\r\n*know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our \n              &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;mind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by \n        =\r\n      a lot of &lt;BR&gt;noise from other parts of our minds which tell other \n  =\r\n            things. Thus, we get &lt;BR&gt;confused.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We should make the be=\r\nst \n              judgment combining discrimination and intuition and &lt;BR&gt;d=\r\necide \n              what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may be =\r\nerr, but \n              doing &lt;BR&gt;the best we can is all that we can do!&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;More than \n              following dharma, what is of utmost importanc=\r\ne is to engage in \n              &lt;BR&gt;actions without identification. *That*=\r\n alone ensures that we \n              are not &lt;BR&gt;accumulating new karmas, =\r\ni.e. not increasing the load. \n              We should not build &lt;BR&gt;too mu=\r\nch attachment to what we are doing. \n              We should engage in the =\r\nbest &lt;BR&gt;possible actions (based on our \n              best judgment on wha=\r\nt our dharma in the given &lt;BR&gt;situation is), \n              with as little =\r\nattachment and self-identification with the \n              &lt;BR&gt;action as po=\r\nssible. When the action is finished, we should \n              leave the res=\r\nult &lt;BR&gt;to god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what \n              will h=\r\nappen now&quot;, &quot;will it &lt;BR&gt;work&quot; etc. Such adherence of \n              nishka=\r\nma karma yoga (unfication through &lt;BR&gt;untached action) will \n              =\r\nsimplify our ego and purify our consciousness slowly. &lt;BR&gt;As we \n          =\r\n    become purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma \n         =\r\n     clearer. &lt;BR&gt;There is a positive feedback here. This will slowly \n    =\r\n          enable us to see our &lt;BR&gt;dharma clearly and follow it without \n  =\r\n            incurring new karmas. This is not easy, &lt;BR&gt;but not as difficul=\r\nt \n              as people think.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The bottomline is: Even if one is =\r\nnot \n              following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense of &lt;BR&gt;&quot;this is my d=\r\nharma&quot; \n              gets refined with time if one engages in action with =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;little \n              attachment.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In deciding one&#39;s=\r\n dharma, one&#39;s \n              intellect and intuition are the inputs. &lt;BR&gt;A=\r\nnother external input \n              is the words of scriptures and learned=\r\n men. One can &lt;BR&gt;derive \n              one&#39;s dharma from them. A special p=\r\nlace is given to one&#39;s \n              spiritual &lt;BR&gt;master. If one surrende=\r\nrs to a spiritual master, one \n              can take the words of &lt;BR&gt;the =\r\nmaster to determine one&#39;s dharma and \n              follow it sincerely.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When Arjuna was confused about what \n              his dharma was and =\r\nthought killing gurus &lt;BR&gt;and relatives was not \n              dharma, he h=\r\nad a guru in Krishna who clarified his &lt;BR&gt;dharma. \n              When Nare=\r\nndranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his \n              dharma &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;and wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded \n              pla=\r\nce to do sadhana, &lt;BR&gt;Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and \n              prev=\r\nailed upon him to stay in the material &lt;BR&gt;world and do the \n              =\r\nwork of Mother for him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One who is not in tune with nature \n        =\r\n      and does not know who one is, what one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;debts are and what \n    =\r\n          nature expects from one can err in the judgment of what &lt;BR&gt;one&#39;s=\r\n \n              dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear i=\r\nnsight \n              into &lt;BR&gt;one&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give perfe=\r\nct \n              guidance.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bottomline is that I (or an=\r\nybody) \n              cannot outline a set of principles and &lt;BR&gt;declare th=\r\nat as the \n              dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person, =\r\nfrom &lt;BR&gt;time to \n              time and from place to place. Also, there a=\r\nre no thumbrules to \n              find &lt;BR&gt;out what one&#39;s dharma is.
