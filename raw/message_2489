Will you allow someone who co=\r\noks terribly to cook? Why  not allow him to &quot;serve god&quot;?\n \nIt is not just a=\r\nbout &quot;serving god&quot;, but serving god *well*. A purified servant of god serve=\r\ns god with single-minded focus and devotion and has no other thoughts in mi=\r\nnd when serving god. A more normal person may think various things in mind =\r\neven when serving god. There is some self-centeredness and ego even in serv=\r\ning god.\n \nThe god in your homam fire is not an external god, but your own =\r\ninternal god. Through your mental focus, you are projecting the limited man=\r\nifestation of god inside you into fire and honing your ability to focus the=\r\n mind on that god. I want to clarify one thing here. Though there is actual=\r\nly infinite divinity inside you, your pre-occupation with so many other thi=\r\nngs limits (or zeroes) the divinity that your mind can focus on, access and=\r\n perceive. By focusing on it more and more, you grow it. Fire is a good med=\r\nium to project it for focusing better. On practice, the divinity inside you=\r\n that you can focus on and perceive grows with time. Thus, remember that wh=\r\nat is in fire is the limited manifestation of god inside you that you are a=\r\nble to focus, acces and perceive. This limited divinity should be nurtured =\r\nslowly and allowed to grow, rather than used up for unnecessary things. Whe=\r\nn this divinity grows and becomes infinite, all your desires and other thou=\r\nghts will vanish and you will be able to single-mindedly focus on that divi=\r\nnity. Some precautions will help you in the journey.\n \nKarmas and thoughts =\r\nof people who are making offerings in your homam fire are basically being r=\r\neceived in your internal god. If he has enough power (his power is, after a=\r\nll, the power of *your own* focus!) to grant a specific desire of someone, =\r\nhe may just do it. But that makes him weaker and who knows whether the desi=\r\nre was worthwhile?!\n \nOf course, when you are offering things in fire, you =\r\nyourself may have some unnecessary desires which may slow down the spiritua=\r\nl progress. But, that is a necessary evil and there is no escape. But, why =\r\nlet someone else&#39;s desires cause an extra slow down?\n \nThus, this is not a =\r\nmatter of political correctness and being nice.\n \nHowever, there is already=\r\n a lot of karmic intermixing between people very closely connected to one k=\r\narmically, like wife, children and parents. Wife&#39;s desires may affect husba=\r\nnd&#39;s desires and mother&#39;s desires may affect son&#39;s desires already (atleast=\r\n in a closely bonded and old-fashioned families). So there is no significan=\r\nt drawback to allowing them to share fire.\n \nBottomline:\n \nIf some people a=\r\nre so close to you that you want to allow their karmas and their desires to=\r\n affect your spiritual progress and slow you down, then allow such people t=\r\no offer in your homam fire. Even if you do not allow specifically, some clo=\r\nse people&#39;s karmas and desires may already be directly affecting your own k=\r\narmas and desires and hence slowing you down!\n \nUsually, that would be imme=\r\ndiate family, but you know your situation better.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha=\r\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Sh=\r\nort Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas =\r\nYourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://group=\r\ns.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastr=\r\no.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrolo=\r\nger.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n---=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- naar=\r\naayana_iyer &lt;narayan.iyer@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste Shri Krishna Kanth,\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; I am sure Narasimha meant outside of your immediate family.

What this namboodiri did is the correct w=\r\nay.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Visualize the external fire as your internal fire and worship =\r\nit. Then offerings in it will kindle your internal fire and streamline it, =\r\ndepending on how strong your identification is (it will get stronger with p=\r\nractice). If anyone handles that external fire or makes offerings in it, so=\r\nme karmas will be submitted by that person to your internal fire for burnin=\r\ng. This intermingling of karmas can be allowed for people whose karmas are =\r\nanyway intertwined, like husband and wife or parents and children. Of cours=\r\ne, you can also take on karmas from the entire world if you are ready and w=\r\nilling to face their consequences, but a person with a strong individualize=\r\nd ego should limit the karmas one faces and work on erasing that ego. When =\r\none&#39;s ego becomes very subtle, it may be possible to take on more karmas an=\r\nd face their consequences. After all, if you start plucking leaves, flowers=\r\n and fruits from a small plant, it will die. If you guard it and let it gro=\r\nw very\n&gt; &gt;  big, it can give flowers and fruits to many more people. So, un=\r\ntil you become very pure, keep working to burn your karmas and free yoursel=\r\nf from the vaasanas (mental conditioning) caused by them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But some=\r\n people use fire in the same way an idol is used. They allow anyone to star=\r\nt the fire in their homam, handle the fire and make offerings in it etc. If=\r\n one who strongly identifies one&#39;s internal fire with external fire does su=\r\nch things, it can be disastrous. However, luckily, most people who follow t=\r\nhis approach do not understand much about fire and do not have a strong ide=\r\nntification with the fire. So, fire is practically like an idol for them an=\r\nd they do not benefit from fire as much as one can. Thus, allowing everyone=\r\n to start or handle or making offerings into you fire can be inefficient at=\r\n best and disastrous at worst.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The best approach is: You start you=\r\nr own fire. Only you handle it. Only you make offerings in it. In your mind=\r\n, identify it with your own internal fire (bhootaagni) that burns in the su=\r\nbtle body. If you do this for a while, a strong bond is indeed formed. With=\r\nout your knowledge, the internal fire will become strong and burn various v=\r\naasanas.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (2) There are different methods for beeja, shakti and kee=\r\nlakam, though anga nyaasa and kara nyaasa are usually standard. Do not worr=\r\ny about these things and do what you are used to or what you are more attra=\r\ncted to.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As I said many times, these nyaasas are just formality fo=\r\nr most people. Placing a letter in a particular body part has a higher sign=\r\nificance than just tough a part and saying it. Visualizing a specific body =\r\npart vibrating with a specific sound is possible only after one makes suffi=\r\ncient progress in purifying one&#39;s subtle perception. So there is no point i=\r\nn discussing what is essentially a formality. I can tell you that this will=\r\n not block you.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (3) They should be shown in the video. If you cann=\r\not get them, please feel free to just say it and not show any mudra.

Doing a one-off homam that takes 3-4 =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hours is far less useful than doing a 30 min homam everyday.
