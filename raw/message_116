Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@.=\r\n..&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Sharat ji,\n&gt;\n&gt; I believe deepa homam can be performed w=\r\nith a deepam, with drops of\noil\n&gt; offered into the deepam with mantras. How=\r\never, compared to fire in\nregular\n&gt; homam, fire in a deepa homam is restric=\r\nted and unfree. Thus, a regular\nhomam\n&gt; is far more effective than a deepa =\r\nhomam.\n&gt;\n&gt; But, if you have no better choice, it can certainly be considere=\r\nd.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some people living in apartments in USA have performed Mahaganapathi=\r\n\nhomam,\n&gt; but I am not that familiar with UK.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you use dry coconut pi=\r\neces only (i.e. no wood) and put the right\namount\n&gt; of ghee, it actually ge=\r\nnerates hardly any smoke. However, that takes a\n&gt; little bit of practice. D=\r\noing the homam near a window and keeping the\nwindow\n&gt; open can also help.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; There is a smoke detector right next to the door (which is always kept\no=\r\npen)\n&gt; of the room in which I do my daily homam at my house. It goes off ve=\r\nry\n&gt; rarely.\n&gt;\n&gt; If Ganapathi wants you to worship Him in fire, He will sho=\r\nw you the\nway.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------\n&gt; Homam manual and audio: http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedi=\r\nc-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;=\r\n Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jaga=\r\nnnath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -----------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message =\r\n-----\n&gt; From: &quot;Sharat&quot; gidoc@...\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent:=\r\n Sunday, August 19, 2007 7:32 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Ganapati Havan/H=\r\nomam\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ||Namah Shivaya||\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Sri Narsimha ji,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I foll=\r\now your teachings and lessons very closely and have been\n&gt; &gt; reflecting on =\r\nbeginning the Ganapati havan as per your teching and\n&gt; &gt; illustrations.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n However I live in a modern apartment in UK,with fire/smoke alrams;\n&gt; &gt; hav=\r\ne no personal open ground or balcony.
