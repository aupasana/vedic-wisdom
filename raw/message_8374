Maki=\r\nng an idol of Durga from the mud collected from the house of a widow and a =\r\nprostitute! I interpret that ritual to demonstrate that Durga abides in the=\r\n heart of a prostitute as much as she does in the heart of a saint, and so =\r\nthe soil from both their houses is equally sacred. \n\nI&#39;m glad to hear you s=\r\nay that tantra has so many women of high spiritual calibre...that&#39;s very in=\r\nspiring. What a pity we don&#39;t hear much about them.\n\nI recently read a wond=\r\nerful book about the women saints of India, called &quot;Daughters of the Goddes=\r\ns&quot;, written by an American devotee of the Goddess (Linda Johnsen). She aske=\r\nd the same question &quot;Where are the women saints of India?&quot;. A Pandit ji rep=\r\nlied, &quot;just because they don&#39;t stand on public stages and give seminars, do=\r\nesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t exist!&quot;. Linda then went on a pilgrimage to India and=\r\n met Ammachi (of Kerala), Anandi Ma and other living realised saints in the=\r\n female form. I&#39;ve met Amma, but would love to meet some of the yoginis and=\r\n Bhairavis you mention.\n\nI&#39;m curious about tantra and would like to learn m=\r\nore about it. I like Japa as my main spiritual practice,  but I&#39;m open to l=\r\nearning about other paths (tantra probably includes Japa for all I know). A=\r\nnd learning more about Goddess worship would be great. I see Durga as my sp=\r\niritual guide, keeping me on the path, doing the Sadhana with me (because I=\r\n&#39;m too lazy to do it on my own), and Hari as the goal (actually they&#39;re the=\r\n same in my head and are both my goal as my divine parents). The cowherd gi=\r\nrls of yore, clever girls, knew that the Goddess alone could give them Hari=\r\n...as we all know, they famously worshipped Katyayani asking for Krishna, a=\r\nnd She gave Him to them! \n\nPlease could you reccommend some articles/books =\r\non tantra. I would love to have a read and educate myself on this, and may =\r\nbe even, add something to my practice. My only worhip of Durga currently (a=\r\nside from abusing and praising her alternately) is repeating her mantra Om =\r\nDum Durgayai Namaha (or Om Shri Durgayai Namaha) randomly. (My main mantra =\r\nthat I got intiated into from a Swami of the Sivananda tradition is Om Namo=\r\n Narayanaya.) And I have recently added homams to my practice, albeit only =\r\nonce in 2 weeks, and I worship both her and Hari with it (it&#39;s not a perfec=\r\nt homam technique wise, but I try and put a bit of heart in it. And if I ca=\r\nn&#39;t find any heart, I blame Durga for not giving me any! She gets a lot of =\r\nabuse from me I&#39;m afraid, but as she made me, it&#39;s her own fault). \n\nThanks=\r\n again for the message, and here&#39;s to tantra, the path that treats women as=\r\n equals! \n\nAparna\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;r=\r\najarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Very authentic questions! Allow me =\r\nto add some perspective to it, which may or may-not be helpful.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;How =\r\noutrageous that for centuries, and even today, women were not \n&gt; allowed to=\r\n be initiated into the Gayatri (which is to the Goddess). Why \n&gt; aren&#39;t the=\r\nre more women saints? The ratio of female to male saints is \n&gt; probably 1:1=\r\n0. It&#39;s bloody disheartening. And what is the point of \n&gt; covering us with =\r\nignorance (it&#39;s her fault, she is the Avidya Maya), and then yelling at us =\r\nfor not being wise (as she does in all the \n&gt; scriptures).&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I assume =\r\nfrom your words that you have been exposed to some standard view-points abo=\r\nut Durga, (Avidya/Maya and all that stuff). In some branches of the Adwaith=\r\na philosophy it is said that Shakti (Durga) is Maya and Avidya. Irony being=\r\n that, adherents of these branches were hardly the folks, historically spea=\r\nking, who chief deity was Ma Durga.\n&gt; \n&gt; The path that *actually* worshiped=\r\n Her, was/is Tantra, which believes, there is no &quot;Avidya&quot; at all. Brahman/t=\r\nhe-state-called-Atman is true, and so is the world of duality which is but =\r\na manifestation/projection of that core. In the path of Tantra, which was n=\r\neither mainstream nor geographically widespread, there was never any restri=\r\nction to females with respect to sadhana. Not only were women initiated, bu=\r\nt there were fantastic women of exceptional spiritual caliber, and they use=\r\nd to be classified based on the levels they had achieved as &quot;uttara-sadhika=\r\ns&quot;, &quot;bhairavis&quot; and &quot;yoginis&quot;. While mainstream Hinduism was busy burning w=\r\nidows alive in the name of some dubious rules, Tantras boldly declared Sati=\r\n-daha as an abomination, rejected the caste-system totally, and allowed wom=\r\nen the status of spiritual preceptors when they could attain certain states=\r\n. One of the Gurus of Sri Ramakrishna was a Bhairavi who taught him Tantra.=\r\n The first person to worship\n&gt;  UgraTara south of the Vindya Hills was the =\r\nwife of a disciple of Sri Ramana Maharishi, who was initiated into this wor=\r\nship by a Bhairavi in Mithila. If a Bhairavi has the caliber to teach a Ram=\r\nakrishna, would she not have the caliber to act as gurus for average folks?=\r\n Sure. But then, history does not even record her real name. Why? Because, =\r\nthe system of Tantra as well as those who followed the path - both men and =\r\nwomen - were firmly rejected by mainstream brahminical Hinduism; thus they =\r\nnever gained any popularity, except for the wrong reasons. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Every w=\r\norship of Durga that happens anywhere today is India is still a watered-dow=\r\nn version from the Tantras. The concept of ChanDi Homa was first mentioned =\r\nin the Damara and Katyayani Tantras. In Bengal every rule of Durga Puja is =\r\nfrom the various Tantric schools. [For example, when creating an idol of Du=\r\nrga, the mud has to be collected from 4/5 different places such as from hom=\r\ne of a prostitute, a river-bed, a widow&#39;s house, etc etc.] \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; So it i=\r\ns not that those who followed the path of Ma Durga never had women saints. =\r\nInfact, they had more women in their folds who were accorded the highest sp=\r\niritual status than in mainstream Hinduism. But since Tantra itself was nev=\r\ner popular, neither were these saints popular. And things like female foeti=\r\ncide were unheard of in places where the worship of the Goddess was popular=\r\n. Even the misguided thugees - infamous worshipers of Ma Kali - who were gu=\r\nilty of rampant human-sacrifices, would never dare to offer a woman as a sa=\r\ncrifice to Ma Kali, for they feared of Her wrath since Tantras strictly for=\r\nbid harming the female of any specifies for a worshiper of the Goddess. So =\r\nif blame has to be laid for mistreatment of women, objectively it would not=\r\n fall on those whose chief worship was of Durga or Kali or one of Her forms=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Bazeecha-e-atfal hain duniya me=\r\nre aage.\n&gt; Hota hain shab-o-roz tamasha mere aage\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Ek khel hain a=\r\nurang-e-sulemaan mere nazdeek\n&gt; Ek baat hain ijaz-e-masiah mere aage.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt;  From: sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Sent: Saturday, 16 June 2012 12:13 =\r\nAM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Karmic liability for Tantra &quot;material sadh=\r\nana&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;scsa_ta=\r\nker3&quot; &lt;scsa_taker3@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; First of all, to anyone reading this , =\r\nplease chant mentally while\n&gt; &gt; reading, time is running out, who knows whe=\r\nn you will reach the\n&gt; &gt; cremation ground, chant and chant. For those who d=\r\non&#39;t have anything to\n&gt; &gt; chant, please chant ram, waheguru, allah or any n=\r\name, mentally. Recite\n&gt; &gt; any mantra, anything, every waking moment should =\r\nbe devoted to god,\n&gt; &gt; because its the only worthwhile thing to do as a hum=\r\nan.\n&gt; &gt; Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the advice to chant till=\r\n the cremation ground. Sound advice no doubt.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately Durga is p=\r\nartial to some of her children it seems, and not all of us are blessed with=\r\n the intense desire to chant as you seem to be. Stop rubbing it in please. =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; What is the use of asking us to chant more? Ask her to give us this d=\r\nesire, as she seems to have done for you. \n&gt; \n&gt; Which brings me to ranting =\r\na bit about the general injustice of our esteemed Durga. The Atman is sexle=\r\nss, but the Atman in female form has been treated worse than the Atman in m=\r\nale form over the centuries...even today it is being murdered in the womb (=\r\nfemale foeticide), raped, burnt in Sati etc etc. Yes yes it is deathless et=\r\nc, but while in this ignorant state, it still suffers in the form of women.=\r\n I hasten to add that I am no feminist but right now, I&#39;m furious with Durg=\r\na. How outrageous that for centuries, and even today, women were not allowe=\r\nd to be initiated into the Gayatri (which is to the Goddess). Why aren&#39;t th=\r\nere more women saints? The ratio of female to male saints is probably 1:10.=\r\n It&#39;s bloody disheartening. And what is the point of covering us with ignor=\r\nance (it&#39;s her fault, she is the Avidya Maya), and then yelling at us for n=\r\not being wise (as she does in all the scriptures). If she wants to save us,=\r\n she will have to create in us the desire\n&gt;  to do japa or whatever. I wash=\r\n my hands of the whole thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; So don&#39;t tell us to chant, tell her to t=\r\nell us to chant. Like she told you to. It&#39;s not our fault.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ok rant ove=\r\nr. I&#39;m going to control my temper and do some Om Namo Narayanaya repetition=\r\n now. Who knows when it&#39;s time for the cremation ground? You did it for a s=\r\nelect few, but not for the rest of us millions- Damn you Durga. \n&gt; \n&gt; Aparn=\r\na\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
