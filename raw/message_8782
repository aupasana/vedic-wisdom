Hmm... let me see... Hmm.. Yes... You seem to=\r\n be performing some kind of Agni karya at your home regularly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Myself:=\r\n Yes (I was actually very surprised by this pointed question because I had =\r\nnot told anybody about the havan I did at home)\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa conductor: The=\r\nre are certain errors in the agni karya you are doing. You seem to be using=\r\n dry samith materials. And your ahuti does not seem to be right.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mysel=\r\nf: Yes I am using Til (sesame seeds).\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa conductor: You should mi=\r\nx that with atleast a little bit of ghee before giving it as ahuti.\n&gt; \n&gt; My=\r\nself: Ok. And what is the dosha in my ahuti apart from that?\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa c=\r\nonductor: Do you do required Japa before giving ahutis? And do you do the a=\r\nhuti with the same mantra that you use for your regular japa?\n&gt; \n&gt; Myself: =\r\nWhat?... Required Japa? Is there a pre-requisite like that? No I dont do an=\r\ny pre-defined set of japa?\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa conductor: Yes. Strictly the japa-a=\r\nhuti ratio is shatamsha. (that is for every 100 recitation of a mantra via =\r\nmeditation, one becomes qualified for one ahuti) or at least it should be d=\r\nashamsha ( i.e. for every 10 recitations of mantra in meditation, one is qu=\r\nalified to give 1 ahuti)\n&gt; \n&gt; Myself: Doesnt that only apply to purascharaN=\r\na (based on what I read in Aghore book - as everybody in this group is alre=\r\nady familiar with that book series)\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa conductor: No it applies t=\r\no anything. PurascharaNa or regular chanting. Doesnt matter. The rule is al=\r\nways 1:100 or at least 1:10. You have to follow it strictly.\n&gt; \n&gt; The conve=\r\nrsation went onto several other things. Subsequently I went on to get mantr=\r\na-upadesha from a accomplished seer and reciting that mantra and also using=\r\n the same mantra for my ahuti in homam as per the above mentioned ratio onl=\r\ny and have been very happy with my spiritual progress since. \n&gt; \n&gt; Whether =\r\nall the homa-practioners in this group agree with me or not, I just wanted =\r\nto point this out to all requesting everybody to perform at least 10 times =\r\nJapa of the mantra used for ahuti to get the &quot;qualification&quot; for the ahuti.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Ashutosh\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
