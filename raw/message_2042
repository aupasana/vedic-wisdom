It is fine to work hard like a honeybee, be engross=\r\ned in material life and feel many happinesses and sadnesses of life. The on=\r\nly thing missed out is self-realization and moksha.\n \n(b) Not exactly. Spir=\r\nitual progress does not mean shunning material things. Some people leave wi=\r\nfe, children, house, car etc and live in forest, in an attempt to get contr=\r\nol over the mind and remove the attachment to and dependency on those thing=\r\ns. However, it is not necessary. One can remove the dependency on all thing=\r\ns that surround one, even as one remains in their middle! Staying away from=\r\n something is neither necessary nor sufficient to overcome attachment. What=\r\n things and people are around you and what actions you engage in are not th=\r\ne problem that blocks you from moksha. It is how you look at them and with =\r\nwhat frame of mind you engage in the actions that are the blockages. So the=\r\n problem is not the material world around you, but your own mind that is th=\r\ne problem. Detachment does not mean not loving or not engaging in actions. =\r\nDetachment means loving but without expectations and engaging in actions bu=\r\nt without expectations.\n \nIf you give love and do not expect anything in re=\r\nturn, if you put in your best effort towards what you see as your dharma fo=\r\nr people around you and do not worry about things that go wrong, if you foc=\r\nus on the present and engage in the best possible actions without too much =\r\nof worry or anxiety about past or future, can there be anything more effect=\r\nive or efficient than that?\n \nIf one is like a drop of water on a lotus lea=\r\nf and engages in actions without attachment, one is not necessarily a failu=\r\nre materially. Such a person will do everything a person with deep attachme=\r\nnts does, but only better! I say better, because a detached person does not=\r\n waste time worrying about things out of one&#39;s hand or things that went wro=\r\nng. A detached person always focuses on the best action to engage in right =\r\nnow and does it.\n \nLet me put this in one sentence: Attachment does not mak=\r\ne you more effective or efficient. In fact, if anything, attachment makes y=\r\nou less effective and efficient. If you are detached, you will give uncondi=\r\ntionally and engage in actions without any energy being dispersed on worryi=\r\nng over things out of your control. Normal people waste a lot of their time=\r\n, energy and emotional space, worrying about things they cannot control. A =\r\ndetached person does what is in one&#39;s control perfectly and accepts the res=\r\nult whole-heartedly.\n \n(c) If you are a jeevanmukta, you will do everything=\r\n you see as your dharma, but only better. You will not feel happy or sad or=\r\n jealous and angry etc. Your mind will be in a stable, peaceful and blissfu=\r\nl state always. It is worth it. You are not getting out of anything, but pu=\r\ntting in the best effort.\n \n(e) Yes, do not think of emancipation or libera=\r\ntion. Think one small step at a time. Think of getting some physical and me=\r\nntal discipline. Think of some minor control over mind. Thinking overcoming=\r\n minor weaknesses. Start slowly.\n \n(f) There are many ways. The specific wa=\r\ny using which many people will benefit in the next few centuries and the sp=\r\necific way which I am here to teach is &quot;homam&quot; or fire ritual. When you are=\r\n with a person, the physical vibrations made by the person&#39;s lips can be he=\r\nard physically by your ears. Similarly, the vibrations made by his subtle b=\r\nody and mind can be &quot;heard&quot; by your subtle body and mind. That is why we fe=\r\nel pleasant when we are with great saints and uneasy in some companies. The=\r\n vibrations produced by the subtle and causal bodies of people around us do=\r\n have an impact on us. Fire is one powerful object which has very pleasant,=\r\n powerful and cleansing vibrations at the subtle and causal levels. Being n=\r\next to fire of a reasonable size is like being with a great yogi.\n \nIf one =\r\ndoes a 20-40 min Mahaganapathi homam everyday for 2-3 years, things will au=\r\ntomatically start to fall in place.\n \nThe problem you are seeking is your m=\r\nind. The solution is also in your mind. You use your mind to train mind to =\r\nlet go of its weaknesses and attachments one by one.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasi=\r\nmha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a=\r\n Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpan=\r\nas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://gr=\r\noups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedica=\r\nstro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n  ----=\r\n- Original Message ----- \n  From: Sanjay Prasad \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, June 24, 2009 6:17 AM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-wi=\r\nsdom] Re: Descent of the Supramenal Conscinousness\n\n\n  Dear Narasimha,\n\n  V=\r\nery good article/discussion..Thanks for sharing it.\n\n  If I can, Let me als=\r\no ask some basic questions. (I am very new to all this. Search for some ans=\r\nwers has brought me to this forum.) \n\n  a) Why Madhukaitam is  so bad/evil?=\r\n Is it not that the world is being sustained by people keeping their head d=\r\nown and doing the routine work? Do we not please the God by keeping our hea=\r\nd down and playing the role assigned to us ? An obvious answer comes to min=\r\nd is that it will keep us away from emancipation and/self-actualization. Co=\r\nrrect/Incorrect? \n\n  b) So,  Is spirituality and materialism two poles apar=\r\nt (and twain shall never meet..). Say I wd like to reach the heights of pro=\r\nfessional success in my career, Am I doomed not to become a good spirituali=\r\nst (???)? or, If I want to become self-actualized by 2025, does it mean I s=\r\nhould stop planning to climb the professional ladder? I do understand about=\r\n &quot;Limited Bandwidth&quot; issue - but, then I also read about King Janak. Can I =\r\ncombine these two - if yes, how?\n\n  c) Getting even more confused now,  Why=\r\n do we say that emancipation is our spiritual goal. If GOD created us, and =\r\nput us on this stage - should our goal not be to play the role dutifully, w=\r\nhich God wants us to play. By seeking for emancipation, are we trying to ge=\r\nt off the stage and trying to escape the role assigned to us. Are we not co=\r\nntradicting the God&#39;s scheme of things by trying to get out of the scheme? =\r\n\n\n  d) Or, Is it part of God&#39;s scheme to put us in this &quot;maya&quot; first and th=\r\nen ask us to get out of the &quot;maya&quot;? Why will he do so? I am sure he will no=\r\nt be playing &quot;rats in the maze&quot; game. Then, why??\n\n  e) Sometimes, I also t=\r\nhink that all these above questions are meaningless. I look at my pre-schoo=\r\nl kid and the way she has put her faith in her teacher. She is not worrying=\r\n about her profession or phd thesis right now. Similarly, probably, Emancip=\r\nation/Merger in Cosmic soul etc are problems that we should not be thinking=\r\n at the begining of our spiritual journey - just look to learn/experience m=\r\nore till we are ready (for what?)\n\n  f) Then, what do we mean by spiritual =\r\njourney? where/how do we start? I thought about doing homam/reciting mantra=\r\n - but is that the right way? or there is another way. Probably, there are =\r\nmany ways - then how do I choose my way? An &quot;user guide&quot; or &quot; spirituality =\r\nfor dummies&quot; book  would have been useful. Do we have one?\n\n  I will apprec=\r\niate if you can take some time out to guide me here. In fact, probably, I d=\r\nonot even have the right question right now - forget about articulating the=\r\nm well and seeking the answer (I am seeking the problem :))\n\n  Regards\n\n  S=\r\nanjay\n\n  On Wed, Jun 24, 2009 at 9:12 AM, Narasimha P.V.R. Rao &lt;pvr@charter=\r\n.net&gt; wrote:\n\n  Namaste Rajarshi,\n\n  The non-dual Aatman or Brahman is the =\r\noriginal source of everything. But the world of duality is a lot more trick=\r\ny.\n\n  Please see the &quot;many faced diamond&quot; analogy for god at the end of htt=\r\np://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/1 to get clarity on why dif=\r\nferent people give different hierarchies and consider different beings as s=\r\nupreme. As per Narayana sooktam, all gods (including Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva,=\r\n Indra etc) came from Narayana. As per Ganapathi Atharva seersham, all gods=\r\n (including Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Indra etc) came from Ganapathi. As per G=\r\nanapathi Atharva seersham, all gods (including Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Indra=\r\n etc) came from Ganapathi. As per Suryopanishat, all gods (including Brahma=\r\n, Vishnu, Shiva, Indra etc) came from Surya. And so on.\n\n  The duality is s=\r\no vast and yet non-duality is the underlying supreme reality in duality. Th=\r\nus, the hierarchy within hierarchy will have to start at the connection wit=\r\nh non-duality and it is not one. In other words, any hierarchy given by any=\r\none is with respect to one perspective. I will not be too keen on finalizin=\r\ng one hierarchy, because that cannot be done really. If you haven&#39;t before,=\r\n do read the analogy in the last part of the mail mentioned above. It is an=\r\n analogy worth getting into your thinking system.\n\n  *        *        *\n\n =\r\n &gt; I mean is it the Rishi who is acting our the Mother&#39;s instructions\n  &gt; o=\r\nr is it She who is creating the environment for the Rishi&#39;s wish\n  &gt; to com=\r\ne true? Which one came first?\n\n  There is no causal relationship between th=\r\ne two. Actions of rishis and the will of the supreme cosmic being are in sy=\r\nnc. They just happen together. Neither causes the other.\n\n  Rishis are the =\r\nmost perfected beings without a trace of ego and yet performing actions of =\r\ngreat consequence, with zero attachment. They operate right on the border o=\r\nf duality and non-duality.\n\n  *        *        *\n\n  &gt; As a devotee it is n=\r\natural and simple to believe that the God I\n  &gt; pray to is the Ultimate Sup=\r\nreme authority, but when I hear that\n  &gt; Rishis are even beyond this, then =\r\ndoubt creeps in, is the deity\n  &gt; therefore not as supreme as is made out t=\r\no be?\n\n  Our ego does not leave us even in sadhana. Sometimes, one&#39;s belief=\r\n that one&#39;s guru is the best guru or the god one prays to is the supreme on=\r\ne is rooted in one&#39;e ego and one&#39;s need to be the best and be associated wi=\r\nth the best. Just contemplate if that is the case and if it is, try to root=\r\n out such thinking.\n\n  Having said that, do look at the god you pray to as =\r\nthe supreme and try to reach the supreme through him/her by surrendering to=\r\n him/her. If you take a low level manifestation of that deity, then rishis =\r\nmay indeed be beyond him/her as Vimalananda said. But, if you take the high=\r\nest manifestation of the deity, as the supreme cosmic being, then rishis ar=\r\ne his playmates and neither above nor below.\n\n  *        *        *\n\n  If y=\r\nou take a company, there may be a chairman who may be the highest authority=\r\n. But, it may be a ceremonial role and some may consider CEO to be higher w=\r\nhile some may consider the chairman to be higher. Why bother about who is h=\r\nigher? In a company does well, they both work with understanding.\n\n  The hi=\r\nerarchy is irrelevant to one who is a clerk at the company. Just follow the=\r\n order of your boss (guru) instead of wondering whether chairman calls the =\r\nshots or CEO.\n\n  Best regards,\n  Narasimha\n  ------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------\n  Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n  Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicA=\r\nstrologer.org/tarpana\n  Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-w=\r\nisdom\n  Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n  Fr=\r\nee Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n  Sri Jaganna=\r\nth Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n  --------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------- \n\n    ----- Original Message=\r\n ----- \n    From: rajarshi nandy \n    To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n   =\r\n Sent: Tuesday, June 23, 2009 6:56 AM\n    Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: D=\r\nescent of the Supramenal Conscinousness\n\n\n          Namaste Narasmihaji\n\n  =\r\n        I have a question. Though it will probably sound stupid to a learne=\r\nd man like you, but I just could not get a convincing answer to it, so thou=\r\nght of putting this question in this forum.\n\n          You mentioned that a=\r\n senior Maharishi is doing this.

Also, he need not be talki=\r\nng about somebody &quot;connected to&quot; his ashram. Moreover, when it comes to gre=\r\nat lineages, there are connections between all. For example, Aurobindo used=\r\n to visit the house of Sister Nivedita, the foremost disciple of Swami Vive=\r\nkananda and knew her well when he still lived in Calcutta. He had a vision =\r\nin his prison cell of Swami Vivekananda, just a few years after his death, =\r\nin which he imparted Aurobindo some key knowledge. Paramahamsa Yogananda gr=\r\new up in Calcutta and learnt Sanskrit from M, who was a sishya of Ramakrish=\r\nna and wrote the gospel of Ramakrishna. Trilinga Swami sent a tantra teache=\r\nr to Ramakrishna to expand his knowledge. Trilinga Swami knew Lahiri mahash=\r\naya and admired him. And so on.\n\n            Coming back to the main point,=\r\n the supermind established in the field of earth that was referred to by Au=\r\nrobindo can simply be a maharshi paying some attention to matters on earth.=\r\n A maharshi absorbed in the divine in one of the higher planes of conscious=\r\nness can accomplish huge changes on earth by the mere power of his thought.=\r\n If there is a divine play to make some positive changes on earth and a mah=\r\narshi takes part in the play, he may focus a small part of his supermind on=\r\n the affairs of earth and direct a few important souls to do some key work.=\r\n Some important souls (deities, rishis or yogis etc) may send their amshas =\r\n(partial essence) to be born on earth to fulfil different parts of a divine=\r\n play.\n\n            You may then see several (not just one) elevated beings=\r\n, enlightened beings and realized beings born on earth to bring clarity in =\r\ndifferent aspects of spiritual knowledge. Each of them will get specific in=\r\nternal/external guidance from the divine, based on what their part in the p=\r\nlay is.\n\n            *        *        *\n\n            The &quot;Asura of Falseho=\r\nod&quot; that Aurobindo alluded to is all around us. At the subtlest level, he m=\r\nanifests as false ego in pretty much everybody. At the grossest level, he m=\r\nanifests as blatant lies, wrong propaganda etc.\n\n            One should not=\r\n tolerate this Asura (demon) and fight hard. However, one should not hate t=\r\nhis Asura or those afflicted by him. When we encounter lies, we should figh=\r\nt and stand for truth but not hate the liar at the same time. There is noth=\r\ning that needs to be hated in this world. One should learn to do the job as=\r\nsigned to one by Nature without attraction or repulsion to anything or anyb=\r\nody and with unconditional love (i.e. no expectations of a return) to all.\n=\r\n\n            &gt; This was a very interesting read and matches what Narasimhaj=\r\ni\n            &gt; says about changes coming in the world.\n\n            I know=\r\n very little. But I was told that an age that is somewhat like the bygone a=\r\nges will be established on earth for a few hundred years in the coming deca=\r\ndes. The reason the Divine Mother appeared before Manish and asked him to s=\r\npread simple homam procedures in the world was to prepare the grounds for t=\r\nhat. Manish also told me that all this is the play of a senior maharshi.\n\n =\r\n           Best regards,\n            Narasimha\n            ------------ ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n            Do a S=\r\nhort Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n            Do =\r\nPitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n         =\r\n   Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n            =\r\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n          =\r\n  Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n        =\r\n    Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n      =\r\n      ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- \n\n              ----- Original Message ----- \n              From: Laxmi=\r\n Narayan \n              To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n              S=\r\nent: Sunday, June 21, 2009 6:50 PM\n              Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom=\r\n] Descent of the Supramenal Conscinousness\n\n                    Hi, Some ti=\r\nme back I saw  similar article and was intrigued by it.

I am posting it here for any=\r\none interested.\n\n                            Near the beginning of the 20th=\r\n century the great Indian freedom fighter and yogi-sage, Sri Aurobindo, beg=\r\nan to express a truth which had not been expressed before. In his high stat=\r\nes of divine union he saw that the time had come for a new stage in the evo=\r\nlution of mankind. He saw that the divine was to manifest right here on Ear=\r\nth and that the time for this divine emergence into Earth life was now. He =\r\nspoke of heaven descending to Earth, even as Earth experienced a breakdown =\r\ndue to the intrinsic resistance held within her material body towards this =\r\n=EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD\n                            =EF=BF=BD\n          =\r\n                  Sri Aurobindo was joined in Pondicherry, India, by a Fren=\r\nch mystic, Mirra Alfassa, who later became known as the Mother. Together th=\r\ney embarked on a journey of intensive cellular transformation that is very =\r\nrelevant to the colossal uncertainties we face today.\n                     =\r\n       =EF=BF=BD\n                            Sri Aurobindo saw that the div=\r\nine force permeates all matter, and that all matter therefore has a force o=\r\nf consciousness. The process of the divine spirit descending down into matt=\r\ner is called involution. The process by which the divine ascends back upwar=\r\nds out of matter is called evolution. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity =\r\nhas reached a stage where these two events are occurring simultaneously, an=\r\nd in his inner visions, he foresaw that we would soon be experiencing a des=\r\ncent of what he called =EF=BF=BDsupramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=\r\n=BF=BD that would entirely change everything on Earth.\n                    =\r\n        =EF=BF=BD\n                            Man=EF=BF=BDs greatness is no=\r\nt in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in what he makes possible. An immo=\r\nrtal soul is somewhere within him, even if seldom active in most people, wh=\r\nile an eternal spirit overshadows him, even if obstructed from descent by t=\r\nhe hard lid of his constructed personality. There is a great divine plan in=\r\n motion, even if the evidence of the outer senses seems to contradict it.\n\n=\r\n                            Sri Aurobindo recognized that humankind is goin=\r\ng through an evolutionary crisis. A stage has been reached in which the hum=\r\nan mind has made tremendous strides on the one hand, but is left hopelessly=\r\n inadequate to prevent its own extinction as a species. Meanwhile, as the M=\r\nother testified before her death in 1973, a consciousness higher than the h=\r\numan rational mind, what may be termed the Supermind, has recently been est=\r\nablished in the fields of the Earth, and is active there. Our task now is t=\r\no bring it down into cellular consciousness.\n\n                            E=\r\nvolution took a great leap forward with the origins of Life, and later with=\r\n the emergence of Mind. We are now at the threshold of another leap forward=\r\n, even more momentous, as we prepare for the emergence of the Supermind. Sr=\r\ni Aurobindo speaks about four stages of human evolution, which we will soon=\r\n be starting to experience concurrently upon Earth. The first is =EF=BF=BDa=\r\nnimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current species, a rational being possessing an i=\r\nndividualized soul, but largely obstructed from contacting and merging with=\r\n it.\n                            =EF=BF=BD\n                            Next=\r\n is the =EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a species that is spontaneous- ly co=\r\nming to birth under the influence of an ever-expanding supramental field, a=\r\n being that is largely able to merge and live from soul-consciousness rathe=\r\nr than mind-consciousness. \n\n                            Thirdly is the =EF=\r\n=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still inhabit a dense physical body, but w=\r\nill be in possession of the Mind of Light, which is supramental consciousne=\r\nss that has begun to merge with cellular consciousness. \n\n                 =\r\n           Finally, our ultimate goal as a species is the =EF=BF=BDSupramen=\r\ntal Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity incarnated fully within the subtle realms of m=\r\natter. This will be a race of what we could call =EF=BF=BDDescended Masters=\r\n.=EF=BF=BD In this species, the unity of matter and spirit would be fully r=\r\nealized upon Earth.\n\n                            The great work of Sri Auro=\r\nbindo and the Mother was in bringing supramental consciousness down into th=\r\ne cellular consciousness of their own bodies. Since this is a unified consc=\r\niousness, this meant that the supramental consciousness was simultaneously =\r\nbeing brought into the consciousness fields of the Earth, awaiting the mome=\r\nnt when it would flower into its full manifestation in collective matter.\n =\r\n                           Whenever there is a =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD th=\r\nere is corresponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo and the Mother speak of thei=\r\nr experience with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD essentially anti-divin=\r\ne forces, at work in the world today. There is the Asura of Darkness, the A=\r\nsura of Suffering, The Asura of Falsehood, and the Asura of Death. These ar=\r\ne the forces that are so outwardly apparent, and which seem to be in contro=\r\nl of current global events. According to them the Asura of Darkness (Lucife=\r\nr?) has gone through a transformation recently, and the Asura of Suffering =\r\nhas returned to Source, and so only the latter two still remain to wreak ha=\r\nvoc on Earth. Interestingly, they spoke of the Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BD=\r\nchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during World War II, and of their own in=\r\ntensive inner work in countering his influence. It would not be difficult t=\r\no see how this same Asura may be influencing other world leaders in the cur=\r\nrent political sphere.\n\n                            With the descent of thi=\r\ns new vibratory consciousness all our old obsolete human structures will be=\r\n demolished. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that although the changes wi=\r\nll be enormous they would not be necessarily catastrophic. The power of Tru=\r\nth automatically erases Falsehood, and our world for the most part consists=\r\n of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, he maintained, carried a power of harm=\r\nonization which could overcome this resistance by means other than dramatic=\r\n struggle and violence. The Asuras will eventually be absorbed into their o=\r\nriginal emanations of Light, Life, Beauty, and Truth. It may be interesting=\r\n to speculate, with all the violence in the world today, the destruction we=\r\n might have experienced if not for this power of harmonization!\n\n          =\r\n                  When does all this happen? Sri Aurobindo and the Mother b=\r\nelieved that the world stage was set for this quantum descent, and that it =\r\nwas quite imminent. The Mother said in 1968 that the supramental transforma=\r\ntion was a certainty now, and that it would come about with a minimum of de=\r\nstruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough this minimum is still considerable.=EF=BF=BD S=\r\nhe said that the year 2000 would be a turning point.\n\n                     =\r\n       This was a very interesting read and matches what Narasimhaji says a=\r\nbout changes coming in the world.\n\n                            -Regards\n   =\r\n                          Rajarshi\n\n                            The upsurge=\r\n (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra \n                   \n        =\r\n \n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_01A5_01C9F51F.7917E450\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n=EF=BB=BF&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HT=\r\nML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Du=\r\ntf-8&quot;&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;.ygrp-photo-title {\n\tCLEAR: both; FONT-SIZE: =\r\nsmaller; OVERFLOW: hidden; WIDTH: 75px; HEIGHT: 15px; TEXT-ALIGN: center\n}\n=\r\nDIV.ygrp-photo {\n\tBORDER-RIGHT: black 1px solid; BACKGROUND-POSITION: cente=\r\nr 50%; BORDER-TOP: black 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: black 1px solid; WIDTH: 62=\r\npx; BORDER-BOTTOM: black 1px solid; BACKGROUND-REPEAT: no-repeat; HEIGHT: 6=\r\n2px; BACKGROUND-COLOR: white\n}\nDIV.photo-title A {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}=\r\n\nDIV.photo-title A:active {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV.photo-title A:hove=\r\nr {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV.photo-title A:visited {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: =\r\nnone\n}\nDIV.attach-table DIV.attach-row {\n\tCLEAR: both\n}\nDIV.attach-table DI=\r\nV.attach-row DIV {\n\tFLOAT: left\n}\nP {\n\tCLEAR: both; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; PAD=\r\nDING-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-BOTTOM: 3px; OVERFLOW: hidden; PADDING-TOP: 15px\n}\n=\r\nDIV.ygrp-file {\n\tWIDTH: 30px; valign: middle\n}\nDIV.attach-table DIV.attach-=\r\nrow DIV DIV A {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV.attach-table DIV.attach-row DI=\r\nV DIV SPAN {\n\tFONT-WEIGHT: normal\n}\nDIV.ygrp-file-title {\n\tFONT-WEIGHT: bol=\r\nd\n}\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;\n&lt;!--\n#ygrp-mkp{\n  border: 1px solid #=\r\nd8d8d8;\n  font-family: Arial;\n  margin: 14px 0px;\n  padding: 0px 14px;\n}\n#y=\r\ngrp-mkp hr{\n  border: 1px solid #d8d8d8;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #hd{\n  color: #628c2a;=\r\n\n  font-size: 85%;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  line-height: 122%;\n  margin: 10px=\r\n 0px;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #ads{\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad{\n  padding: =\r\n0 0;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad a{\n  color: #0000ff;\n  text-decoration: none;\n}\n--&gt;\n&lt;/=\r\nSTYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3562&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;B=\r\nODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DA=\r\nrial size=3D2&gt;(a) Correct.

Spiritual progress does not mean \nshunning material =\r\nthings. Some people leave wife, children, house, car etc and \nlive in fores=\r\nt, in an attempt to get control over the mind and remove the \nattachment to=\r\n and dependency on those things. However, it is not necessary. One \ncan rem=\r\nove the dependency on all things that surround one, even as one remains \nin=\r\n their middle! Staying away from something is neither necessary nor suffici=\r\nent \nto overcome attachment.&nbsp;What things and people are around you and=\r\n what \nactions you engage in are &lt;EM&gt;not &lt;/EM&gt;the problem that blocks you f=\r\nrom moksha. \nIt is how &lt;EM&gt;you&lt;/EM&gt; look at them and with what frame of min=\r\nd &lt;EM&gt;you \n&lt;/EM&gt;engage in the actions that are the blockages. So the proble=\r\nm is not the \nmaterial world around you, but &lt;EM&gt;your own mind&lt;/EM&gt; that is=\r\n the problem. \nDetachment does not mean not loving or not engaging in actio=\r\nns. Detachment means \nloving but without expectations and engaging in actio=\r\nns but without \nexpectations.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;If you give love and =\r\ndo not expect anything in \nreturn, if you put in your best effort towards w=\r\nhat you see as your dharma for \npeople around you and do not worry about th=\r\nings that go wrong, if you focus on \nthe present and engage in the best pos=\r\nsible actions without too much of worry or \nanxiety about past or future, c=\r\nan there be anything more effective or efficient \nthan that?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial=\r\n size=3D2&gt;If one is like a drop of water on a lotus leaf and \nengages in ac=\r\ntions without attachment, one is not necessarily a failure \nmaterially.

I say better, because a detached person does \nnot waste =\r\ntime worrying about things out of one&#39;s hand or things that went \nwrong. A =\r\ndetached person always focuses on the best action to engage in \n&lt;EM&gt;right n=\r\now &lt;/EM&gt;and does it.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\nFONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Let me put this in one sentenc=\r\ne: Attachment does \nnot make you more effective or efficient. In fact, if a=\r\nnything, attachment makes \nyou less effective and efficient. If you are det=\r\nached, you will give \nunconditionally and engage in actions without any ene=\r\nrgy being dispersed on \nworrying over things out of your control. Normal pe=\r\nople waste a lot of their \ntime, energy and emotional space, worrying about=\r\n things they cannot control. A \ndetached person does what is in one&#39;s contr=\r\nol perfectly and accepts the result \nwhole-heartedly.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FO=\r\nNT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=\r\n=3D2&gt;(c) If you are a jeevanmukta, you will do \neverything you see as your =\r\ndharma, but only better.

If GOD created us, and put us on t=\r\nhis stage - \n  should our goal not be to play the role dutifully, which God=\r\n wants us to play. \n  By seeking for emancipation, are we trying to get off=\r\n the stage and trying to \n  escape the role assigned to us. Are we not cont=\r\nradicting the God&#39;s scheme of \n  things by trying to get out of the scheme?=\r\n &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;d) Or=\r\n, Is it part of God&#39;s scheme to put us in this &quot;maya&quot; first and then \n  ask=\r\n us to get out of the &quot;maya&quot;? Why will he do so? I am sure he will not be \n=\r\n  playing&nbsp;&quot;rats in the maze&quot; game. Then, why??&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;e) Sometimes, I also think tha=\r\nt all these above questions are \n  meaningless. I look at my pre-school kid=\r\n and the way she has put her faith in \n  her teacher. She is not worrying a=\r\nbout her profession or phd thesis right now. \n  Similarly, probably,&nbsp;E=\r\nmancipation/Merger in Cosmic soul etc are problems \n  that we should not be=\r\n thinking at the begining of our spiritual journey - just \n  look to learn/=\r\nexperience more till we are ready (for what?)&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAri=\r\nal size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;f) Then, what do we mean by spiritua=\r\nl journey? where/how do we start? I \n  thought about doing homam/reciting m=\r\nantra - but is that the right way? or \n  there is another way. Probably, th=\r\nere are many ways - then how do I choose my \n  way? An &quot;user guide&quot; or &quot; sp=\r\nirituality for dummies&quot; book&nbsp; would have been \n  useful. Do we have on=\r\ne?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;I wi=\r\nll appreciate if you can take some time out to guide me here. In \n  fact, p=\r\nrobably, I donot even have the right question right now - forget about \n  a=\r\nrticulating them well and seeking the answer (I am seeking the problem \n  :=\r\n))&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;Rega=\r\nrds&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;San=\r\njay&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;On Wed, Jun 24, 2009 at 9:12 AM, Naras=\r\nimha P.V.R.
