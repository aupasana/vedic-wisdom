Everyday when I open my mai=\r\nlbox in the morning, I keep searching for your mails. Each one is an inspir=\r\nation.\n=C2=A0\nOne more point I would like to add, I had read some books on =\r\nThakur in Bengali and in one there was the description of an indicident. On=\r\nce Swamiji wanted to test Thakur. Since Thakur used to say that he could no=\r\nt handle money (as it represented something grossly material), Swamji delib=\r\nerately put a note under Thakur&#39;s pillow when Thakur was not in the room. L=\r\nater when Thakur come to sleep in teh bed, he instantly got up as if in pai=\r\nn and said something is very wrong in here, Hriday, who was used to be ther=\r\ne, searched the bed and found that money under his pillow. But Thakur never=\r\n got offended with these things.\n=C2=A0\nInfact in one instance, when one of=\r\n his disciples had come to him for the first time, Thakur asked him to stay=\r\n over at Dakshineshwar. At night the disciple woke up and saw that Thakur w=\r\nas leaving the room. A doubt entered the disciples mind, he thought maybe T=\r\nhakur is goinfg towards the Nahabat house where Sri Sarada Ma used to stay.=\r\n So he quitely decided to follow Thakur and see where he is going, after al=\r\nl it maybe that Thakur used to visit the Nahabat secretly etc etc.. he was =\r\ngenuinely suspicious. Then as he left the room following Thakur at a distan=\r\nce, he saw Thakur going to the Panchvati and sitting down for meditation an=\r\nd there he sat for two hours.Later when Thakur came back, he told that pers=\r\non, who later became his disciple, that he had done very good to test Thaku=\r\nr. Further Thakur said, no one should accept a Guru without testing. And to=\r\n see and judge a person&#39;s sprittuality he has to be observed when he is pub=\r\nlic and when he is alone. There\n should be no diference in his words and ac=\r\ntions. Etc etc.\n=C2=A0\nEvery incident in Thakur&#39;s life is like an illustrat=\r\nion of a deeper point for ordianry people like us.\n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Ra=\r\njarshi\n\n\n\n&quot;This above all: to thine own self be true!&quot; - Hamlet\n\n--- On Tue=\r\n, 30/9/08, Narasimha P.V.R.

While=C2=A0a really spiritual person must continuously try to dest=\r\nroy ego, so many spiritual gurus are there around us with bloated egos whic=\r\nh are easily offended at a hint of criticism or overly excited at sycophanc=\r\ny. Such gurus are not of much use.\n=C2=A0\nBut how do separate the grains fr=\r\nom the chaff? It is not easy, especially when there are just a few grains i=\r\nn the middle of a big pile of chaff. Astrology is useful but not that much.=\r\n Astrologer&#39;s mind, which makes the final judgments, works based on his/her=\r\n prejudices and secret beliefs.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nIn the past,=\r\n many great souls used intellectual discrimination and intuition to judge o=\r\nne&#39;s guru for a long time before whole-heartedly embracing one&#39;s guru. In m=\r\nany traditions within Hinduism, this is encouraged. You do not accept a gur=\r\nu in an impulse. You &quot;test&quot; your guru and take your time to accept him. But=\r\n, once you accept a person as your guru, you follow him faithfully.\n=C2=A0\n=\r\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nIf you take Narendra (Swami Vivekananda) , the celebr=\r\nated disciple of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, he was a highly rational and skep=\r\ntical young man. Though Ramakrishna had induced a samadhi in Narendra by me=\r\nre touch in their second meeting itself, it was not enough to convince Nare=\r\nndra of Ramakrishna&#39; s ability and purity. He thought the whole experience =\r\ncould just have been a hallucination/ hypnotism and did not jump to any con=\r\nclusion. As he visited Ramakrishna continuously, received love and knowledg=\r\ne from him and saw that Ramakrishna indeed walked the walk (as opposed to j=\r\nust talking the talk), he was slowly convinced of the purity of Ramakrishna=\r\n. He then became a tireless soldier who dedicated his life to carrying out =\r\nthe mission of his guru!\n=C2=A0\nDuring the early stages, he even told Ramak=\r\nrishna bluntly about the latter&#39;s visions of Kali, Krishna, Rama etc, &quot;Sir,=\r\n they could all just be your imaginations or hallucinations&quot; . Narendra did=\r\n not even believe in god with a form and believed only in the formless. Ram=\r\nakrishna was never offended at these comments.\n=C2=A0\nOther sishyas like Jo=\r\nginder (Swami Yogananda) also approached Ramakrishna skeptically and tested=\r\n him for a duration. These young men who surrounded Ramakrishna weren&#39;t bli=\r\nnd men led by a blind man. They were all rishis or associates of rishis, wh=\r\no were reborn together for a purpose.\n=C2=A0\nThey observed Ramakrishna for =\r\na while, confirmed that he practiced what he preached and realized that the=\r\nre was a valuable lesson in each action and word=C2=A0of his. They took a w=\r\nhile to realize his purity and divinity, but once they realized they became=\r\n faithful sishyas. He accepted them, loved them and taught them even before=\r\n they realized his true nature and accepted him fully as their guru. He kne=\r\nw they were skeptical and testing him, but he was never offended (what good=\r\n is a guru who cannot recognize a worthy student and what good is a guru wh=\r\nose ego is insulted at someone&#39;s skepticism). Once they accepted him and be=\r\ncame faithful sishyas, each one of them was also transformed into a really =\r\npure person who takes the entire life as a sadhana and maintains purity in =\r\nevery thought and action. Each sishya of a Ramakrishna was a role model in =\r\nspiritual purity.\n=C2=A0\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0=C2=A0\nOne whose rinas draw=\r\n one towards a fake guru gets such a guru because that is what his karmas e=\r\nntitle him to. The circumstances we have to face are based on the previous =\r\nactions. But the current action (freewill) is in our hands. If one can trul=\r\ny believe from the deepest cores of heart that one&#39;s guru is pure and like =\r\nShiva himself, follows guru blindly and entertains no doubt whatsoever, tha=\r\nt WILL pay off oneday. Nature WILL bring light into that person&#39;s spiritual=\r\n life. It is just a matter of time.\n=C2=A0\nThus, I will not be judgmental a=\r\nbout other gurus and their sishyas. If a sishya believes in his/her guru fu=\r\nlly, so be it. It is not our business.\n=C2=A0\nBut, if one were to find a gu=\r\nru like Ramakrishna Paramahamsa or Ramana Maharshi or Sri Aurobindo or Sril=\r\na Prabhupada, it is one&#39;s immense luck. However, the point I want to make i=\r\ns that having a great guru is not a guarantee of success and also having a =\r\nfake guru is not a guarantee of failure!\n=C2=A0\nAt the end of the day, the =\r\nmeasure of success in any sadhana is the purity generated by that sadhana. =\r\nThe measure of the purity is the effacement of ego. If ego is reduced compl=\r\netely or eliminated, one is making progress. This can happen inspite of who=\r\n is the guru, what one is doing etc.\n=C2=A0\nWhen the full grace of the Supr=\r\neme Being falls on a person, any medium is sufficient to reflect that grace=\r\n.\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- ---------=\r\n --------- --------- ---------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicA=\r\nst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rolog=\r\ner.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom=\r\n\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyot=\r\nish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centr=\r\ne (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n\n\n----- Original Message -----=\r\n \nFrom: Lakshmi Kary \nTo: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \nSent: Monday, Sep=\r\ntember 29, 2008 2:06 AM\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Yogananda (Re: Dharma)\n=\r\n\n\nHare Rama Krishna\nDear Narasimha.\nSorry I got my people and lineages all =\r\nconfused!

But Ramakrishna Paramahamsa stands out in one way. He is one =\r\nmaster who mastered every single path. He mastered bhakti yoga, jnaana yoga=\r\n, karma yoga and even raaja yoga. He worshipped and experienced Rama, Krish=\r\nna, Kaali and several forms. He even reached the state of nirvikalpa samadh=\r\ni, where there is no &quot;experience&quot; . He was in sahaja samadhi always. He was=\r\n able induce tremendous experience in people by mere touch or mere look. Ye=\r\nt he was simple like a child and had zero ego (that is why he could do all =\r\nthat!!!).\n=C2=A0\nMany &quot;gurus&quot; force their dharma on their sishyas and have =\r\nno ability to recognize the true nature and dharma of each sishya. They for=\r\nce sishyas to chant the mantra they chant, worship the form they worship an=\r\nd walk the path they walk. Ramakrishna had deep insight into the true natur=\r\ne of each sishya and gave specific instructions. He taught totally differen=\r\nt mantras, totally different forms and totally different paths to different=\r\n sishyas. He even taught contradictory things to different sishyas. When on=\r\ne sishya who needed to mend his aggressive attitude roughed up somebody for=\r\n insulting his guru, he scolded &quot;shame on you. With your attitude, you did =\r\nnot defend your guru, but brought shame to him. You should learn to be calm=\r\n and ignore such insults. THAT will place your guru in a good stead and not=\r\n your aggression&quot;. When another sishya who needed to mend his soft demeanor=\r\n ignored insults of Ramakrishna by some people and came away silently, he s=\r\ncolded him\n &quot;shame on you. Shastras say that you should kill one who insult=\r\ns your guru. How can you ignore such wrong behavior? You should give them a=\r\n piece of your mind.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nSpiritual sadhana does not mean just chanting =\r\na mantra=C2=A0or repeating a procedure everyday for a certain period of tim=\r\ne. Spiritual sadhana is a continuous process by which one transforms onesel=\r\nf from inside out and purifies oneself. That way, every action and every th=\r\nought=C2=A0becomes a sadhana and offers an opportunity for introspection an=\r\nd transformation of=C2=A0internal attitude.\n=C2=A0\nAnyway, coming back to t=\r\nhe point, Ramakrishna is not a normal sadhaka or a normal guru. He belonged=\r\n to a very special class of sadhakas and he was an exceptional guru to an e=\r\nxceptional group of sishyas.\n=C2=A0\nWithout his [indirect] blessings, I wou=\r\nld be a nobody and would be lower than dirt. I would not be able to say any=\r\nthing intelligent or meaningful in spiritual matters.

Krishna clearly sa=\r\nys in \nBhagavad Geeta &quot;Follow your own dharma. It is dangerous to follow so=\r\nmeone \nelse&#39;s dharma&quot;.\n\nFollowing the path of dharma basically means engagi=\r\nng in the right \naction/duty. Right action varies from person to person, fr=\r\nom time to time \nand from place to place. It is dependent on what nature ex=\r\npects from you, \nwhich in turn is based on who you have been in the past, w=\r\nhat actions you \ndid in the past while identifying with the action, who you=\r\n affected in the \npast (and how) with the actions that you identified with,=\r\n what debts you \ncreated in the process, and what mental tendencies you acc=\r\numulated until \nnow.\n\nIf, based on one&#39;s mental tendencies and karmic debts=\r\n, nature wants a person \nto kill evil persons, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. I=\r\nf, based on one&#39;s mental \ntendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a perso=\r\nn to spread the message of \nuniformity of all religions, that becomes one&#39;s=\r\n dharma. If, based on one&#39;s \nmental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wan=\r\nts a person to spread the \nritual of homam in the world, that becomes one&#39;s=\r\n dharma. If, based on one&#39;s \nmental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wan=\r\nts a person to make a lot of \nmoney and construct a temple, that becomes on=\r\ne&#39;s dharma.\n\n* * *\n\nThe dharma of a being may change from one life to anoth=\r\ner.\n\nAt the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma to kill his gur=\r\nus, \nelders and relatives. The time then was such that there was too much w=\r\neight \non earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight. Trem=\r\nendous \ndestruction was to take place and civilization destroyed to a great=\r\n extent, \nto welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna being a grea=\r\nt warrior, \nit was his dharma to facilitate that. Some people he deeply lov=\r\ned and \nrespected were on the other side and it was his dharma to kill them=\r\n.\n\nWhen the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as one of \nRamak=\r\nrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a \nprevio=\r\nus life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different in this \nnew =\r\ntime and place. He was born to renounce material life despite his \naristocr=\r\natic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and inspire \ngenerations=\r\n to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and service to \nothers. When=\r\n he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna \nsaid), his dha=\r\nrma based on the time and place may be something else.\n\n* * *\n\nThe tricky q=\r\nuestion is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s dharma?\n\nSome people have int=\r\nerpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your own dharma \nand not someone el=\r\nse&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism. Though the concept \nof caste (varna) =\r\nhas been there in Hinduism for a long time, the concept of \ncaste mobility =\r\nwas very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by \nkilling birds. He b=\r\necame a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was a \nkshatrita and a p=\r\nowerful king. He became a brahmana and and a maharshi \nlater. Basically var=\r\nna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with the varna \nof father, because =\r\nthat is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one \ndevelops in life, one =\r\ngets one&#39;s own varna based on what one does.\n\nThus, the misinterpretation o=\r\nf Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to know your \ndharma from your caste is w=\r\nrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas in \nthe world. Each person has=\r\n individual dharma.\n\nKnowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very very very difficu=\r\nlt. If one is pure \nenough, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of u=\r\ns have a part of our \nmind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is surr=\r\nounded by a lot of \nnoise from other parts of our minds which tell other th=\r\nings. Thus, we get \nconfused.\n\nWe should make the best judgment combining d=\r\niscrimination and intuition and \ndecide what is our dharma and follow it si=\r\nncerely. We may be err, but doing \nthe best we can is all that we can do!\n\n=\r\nMore than following dharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage in \na=\r\nctions without identification. *That* alone ensures that we are not \naccumu=\r\nlating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not build \ntoo m=\r\nuch attachment to what we are doing. We should engage in the best \npossible=\r\n actions (based on our best judgment on what our dharma in the given \nsitua=\r\ntion is), with as little attachment and self-identification with the \nactio=\r\nn as possible. When the action is finished, we should leave the result \nto =\r\ngod. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it \nwork=\r\n&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through \nuntached =\r\naction) will simplify our ego and purify our consciousness slowly. \nAs we b=\r\necome purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma clearer. \nThere=\r\n is a positive feedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our \ndharma=\r\n clearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This is not easy, \nbut=\r\n not as difficult as people think.\n\nThe bottomline is: Even if one is not f=\r\nollowing one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense of \n&quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined wit=\r\nh time if one engages in action with \nlittle attachment.\n\n* * *\n\nIn decidin=\r\ng one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are the inputs. \nAnother exte=\r\nrnal input is the words of scriptures and learned men. One can \nderive one&#39;=\r\ns dharma from them. A special place is given to one&#39;s spiritual \nmaster. If=\r\n one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can take the words of \nthe maste=\r\nr to determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.\n\nWhen Arjuna was confu=\r\nsed about what his dharma was and thought killing gurus \nand relatives was =\r\nnot dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his \ndharma. When Narend=\r\nranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dharma \nand wanted to ren=\r\nounce the world and go to a secluded place to do sadhana, \nRamakrishna Para=\r\nmahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the material \nworld and do =\r\nthe work of Mother for him.\n\nOne who is not in tune with nature and does no=\r\nt know who one is, what one&#39;s \ndebts are and what nature expects from one c=\r\nan err in the judgment of what \none&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevat=\r\ned soul with a clear insight into \none&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give p=\r\nerfect guidance.\n\n* * *\n\nBottomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a=\r\n set of principles and \ndeclare that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from=\r\n person to person, from \ntime to time and from place to place. Also, there =\r\nare no thumbrules to find \nout what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine on=\r\ne&#39;s understanding of one&#39;s \ndharma by increasing internal purity. By doing =\r\nvarious kinds of spiritual \nsadhana (like homam, japam etc) and engaging in=\r\n actions without much \nattachment, one can slowly purify oneself and refine=\r\n one&#39;s understanding of \none&#39;s individual dharma.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n=\r\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\nDo a Short=\r\n Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Y=\r\nourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://grou=\r\nps. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedic=\r\nastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicA=\r\nst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath=\r\n.org\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n\n---=\r\n-- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@ yahoo.co. in&gt;\n=\r\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, September 27, 2008 8:0=\r\n2 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Dharma\n\n&gt; Namaste to all\n&gt;\n&gt; i just finished m=\r\ny Aghora series\n&gt; and in it in last part\n&gt; Vimalanda says path of dharma is=\r\n very personal.\n&gt; Can somebody share views on that and how can we approach\n=\r\n&gt; towards it\n&gt; Does it has to do something with vedas and upanishads\n&gt;\n&gt; re=\r\ngards\n&gt; jitender\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Be the first one to try the new Mes=\r\nsenger 9 Beta!

Once Swamiji wanted to test Thakur. Since Thakur used to say that he coul=\r\nd not handle money (as it represented something grossly material), Swamji d=\r\neliberately put a note under Thakur&#39;s pillow when Thakur was not in the roo=\r\nm. Later when Thakur come to sleep in teh bed, he instantly got up as if in=\r\n pain and said something is very wrong in here, Hriday, who was used to be =\r\nthere, searched the bed and found that money under his pillow. But Thakur n=\r\never got offended with these things.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Infact in=\r\n one instance, when one of his disciples had come to him for the first time=\r\n, Thakur asked him to stay over at Dakshineshwar. At night the disciple wok=\r\ne up and saw that Thakur was leaving the room. A doubt entered the disciple=\r\ns mind, he thought maybe Thakur is goinfg towards the Nahabat house where S=\r\nri Sarada Ma used to stay. So he quitely decided to follow Thakur and see w=\r\nhere he is going, after all it maybe that Thakur used to visit the Nahabat =\r\nsecretly etc etc.. he was genuinely suspicious. Then as he left the room fo=\r\nllowing Thakur at a distance, he saw Thakur going to the Panchvati and sitt=\r\ning down for meditation and there he sat for two hours.Later when Thakur ca=\r\nme back, he told that person, who later became his disciple, that he had do=\r\nne very good to test Thakur. Further Thakur said, no one should accept a Gu=\r\nru without testing. And to see and judge a person&#39;s sprittuality he has to =\r\nbe observed when he is public and when he is alone.\n There should be no dif=\r\nerence in his words and actions. Etc etc.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Ever=\r\ny incident in Thakur&#39;s life is like an illustration of a deeper point for o=\r\nrdianry people like us.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG=\r\n&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&quot;This a=\r\nbove all: to thine own self be true!&quot; - Hamlet&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRON=\r\nG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Tue, 30/9/08, Narasimha P.V.R.

Krishna clearly says in &lt;BR&gt;Bhagavad Geeta &quot;Follow =\r\nyour own dharma. It is dangerous to follow someone &lt;BR&gt;else&#39;s dharma&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;Following the path of dharma basically means engaging in the right &lt;BR&gt;a=\r\nction/duty. Right action varies from person to person, from time to time &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;and from place to place. It is dependent on what nature expects from you,=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;which in turn is based on who you have been in the past, what actions =\r\nyou &lt;BR&gt;did in the past while identifying with the action, who you affected=\r\n in the &lt;BR&gt;past (and how) with the actions that you identified with, what =\r\ndebts you &lt;BR&gt;created in the process, and what mental tendencies you accumu=\r\nlated until &lt;BR&gt;now.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If, based on one&#39;s mental tendencies and karmic=\r\n debts, nature wants a person &lt;BR&gt;to kill evil persons, that becomes one&#39;s =\r\ndharma. If, based on one&#39;s mental &lt;BR&gt;tendencies and karmic debts, nature w=\r\nants a person to spread\n the message of &lt;BR&gt;uniformity of all religions, th=\r\nat becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;mental tendencies and karmi=\r\nc debts, nature wants a person to spread the &lt;BR&gt;ritual of homam in the wor=\r\nld, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;mental tendencies and=\r\n karmic debts, nature wants a person to make a lot of &lt;BR&gt;money and constru=\r\nct a temple, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The dharma of a=\r\n being may change from one life to another.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At the time of Mahabhara=\r\nta war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma to kill his gurus, &lt;BR&gt;elders and relatives.=\r\n The time then was such that there was too much weight &lt;BR&gt;on earth and nat=\r\nure wanted earth to be relieved of some weight. Tremendous &lt;BR&gt;destruction =\r\nwas to take place and civilization destroyed to a great extent, &lt;BR&gt;to welc=\r\nome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna being a great warrior, &lt;BR&gt;it=\r\n was his dharma to facilitate that. Some people he deeply loved and &lt;BR&gt;res=\r\npected were on\n the other side and it was his dharma to kill them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;W=\r\nhen the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as one of &lt;BR&gt;Ramakr=\r\nishna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a &lt;BR&gt;prev=\r\nious life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different in this &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;new time and place. He was born to renounce material life despite his &lt;BR&gt;=\r\naristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and inspire &lt;BR&gt;=\r\ngenerations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and service to &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;others. When he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;said), his dharma based on the time and place may be something else.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The tricky question is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s =\r\ndharma?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow =\r\nyour own dharma &lt;BR&gt;and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism.=\r\n Though the concept &lt;BR&gt;of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a l=\r\nong\n time, the concept of &lt;BR&gt;caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki w=\r\nas a shudra who lived by &lt;BR&gt;killing birds. He became a brahmana and a maha=\r\nrshi later. Vishwamitra was a &lt;BR&gt;kshatrita and a powerful king. He became =\r\na brahmana and and a maharshi &lt;BR&gt;later. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitu=\r\nde. One starts off with the varna &lt;BR&gt;of father, because that is what one i=\r\ns exposed to in childhood. As one &lt;BR&gt;develops in life, one gets one&#39;s own =\r\nvarna based on what one does.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna=\r\n&#39;s words which tells you to know your &lt;BR&gt;dharma from your caste is wrong. =\r\nMoreover, there are not just 4 dharmas in &lt;BR&gt;the world. Each person has in=\r\ndividual dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very very very diff=\r\nicult. If one is pure &lt;BR&gt;enough, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, al=\r\nl of us have a part of our &lt;BR&gt;mind that tells us what our dharma is, but i=\r\nt is surrounded by a lot of &lt;BR&gt;noise from other parts of our minds\n which =\r\ntell other things. Thus, we get &lt;BR&gt;confused.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We should make the bes=\r\nt judgment combining discrimination and intuition and &lt;BR&gt;decide what is ou=\r\nr dharma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, but doing &lt;BR&gt;the best we =\r\ncan is all that we can do!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;More than following dharma, what is of ut=\r\nmost importance is to engage in &lt;BR&gt;actions without identification. *That* =\r\nalone ensures that we are not &lt;BR&gt;accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increas=\r\ning the load. We should not build &lt;BR&gt;too much attachment to what we are do=\r\ning. We should engage in the best &lt;BR&gt;possible actions (based on our best j=\r\nudgment on what our dharma in the given &lt;BR&gt;situation is), with as little a=\r\nttachment and self-identification with the &lt;BR&gt;action as possible. When the=\r\n action is finished, we should leave the result &lt;BR&gt;to god. We should not t=\r\nhink &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it &lt;BR&gt;work&quot; etc. Such adher=\r\nence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through &lt;BR&gt;untached\n action) will =\r\nsimplify our ego and purify our consciousness slowly. &lt;BR&gt;As we become pure=\r\nr, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma clearer. &lt;BR&gt;There is a p=\r\nositive feedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our &lt;BR&gt;dh\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
