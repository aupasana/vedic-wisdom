But whatever little, right or wrong, I have understood I will be h=\r\nappy to discuss it with you. I hope I will also get to learn in the process=\r\n. You can email me if you are comfortable.\n\nAbout learning &#39;in between the =\r\nline&#39; content I have felt that method to decode the content is also written=\r\n in Aghora itself. Although it take time to understand the method but it is=\r\n neither difficult nor impossible.\n\nJust a couple of minutes before reading=\r\n your query I opened Tarapeeth bhairav to continue my reading. Usually I re=\r\nad in afternoon when work load is very less. But today I was inclined to re=\r\nad as soon as I reached hospital. I read only few lines and then was inclin=\r\ned to turn on the internet. below are the few lines I read (translated to E=\r\nnglish keeping the basic words in hindi)\n\n&quot;Vamakhepa, Telanga swami and Ram=\r\nakrishna Paramhansa were Brahma, Mahesha and vishnu of this yuga, respectiv=\r\nely. These saints may have left their body but they are still present here.=\r\n Their karma, bhakti, gyan and loveable suksham sharir is still present in =\r\nsacred land of India. and their presence is felt in name, pictures, idols a=\r\nnd songs. But for feeling them one need Shudha Bhakti, Nishkapat saralta, V=\r\nishwaas and chit ki ekagrata&quot;\n\nI hope these lines will help you in your que=\r\nst.\nWith the grace of Maa Tara.\n\nRegards\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Bhatla Ji,\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Thank you very much for sharing this information.

Bhatla&quot; &lt;astrologytree@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Friends,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Last week while sieving our District Library I found a book &quot;Tarapeeth \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;Bhairav&quot;. I was inclined to borrow it so I did. When I read it I felt that=\r\n I am \n&gt; &gt;reading just another version of Aghora Volumes. Things written in=\r\n Aghora are \n&gt; &gt;also mentioned in it (Obviously not the story line but the =\r\nfacts related to \n&gt; &gt;saadhna). While reading I was suddenly inclined to sha=\r\nre about this in this \n&gt; &gt;group so I am writing here. This book will be hel=\r\npful for people who believe \n&gt; &gt;that Lot of things are written in between t=\r\nhe lines in Aghora and are unable to \n&gt; &gt;understand that &#39;in between the li=\r\nne&#39; content may find it helpful. This book may \n&gt; &gt;not add anything much if=\r\n you have already understood that &#39;in between the line&#39; \n&gt; &gt;content but it =\r\nwill be helpful if you are trying to do so. Some details about \n&gt; &gt;the book=\r\n are as under.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This Book is about Yogi Vamacharan who lived about =\r\nthe same time as RamaKrishna \n&gt; &gt;Paramansa lived. Book also mentioned that =\r\nvamacharan met Telanga Swami and also \n&gt; &gt;describe meeting with Telanga swa=\r\nmi. A Granth was written by Shri Sushil Kumar \n&gt; &gt;Vanshopadyay dedicated to=\r\n Vamacharan which was published in 1954.
