Without this h=\r\numility he cannot be a\ntrue disciple.\n\nThe next verse is an introduction to=\r\n the detailed exposition by Bhagavan of\nthe truth concerning the world.\n\n10=\r\n4 Bhagavan, our Guru, being a sage, expounds the unreality of the world by\n=\r\nshowing that the perception of the world takes place in ignorance.\nTherefor=\r\ne, the objector=E2=80=99s argument =E2=80=93 that the world is real because=\r\n he sees\nit =E2=80=93 does not avail to prove his contention.\n\nThe ignorant=\r\n man=E2=80=99s vision of the world is vitiated by the fact of his\nignorance=\r\n of his own real Self. This point has been repeatedly pointed out\nby Bhagav=\r\nan. To know the world aright, one must first know oneself aright.\n\nThe vers=\r\nes that follow show how the seeing of the world is affected and\nfalsified b=\r\ny the primary ignorance.\n\n105 Every creature first identifies his own Self =\r\nwith the body, and thereby\nconcludes that the body is real. Then it comes t=\r\no believe that all forms\nthat are seen are also real.\n\nWhatever is seen is =\r\na form. The initial question therefore is whether forms\nare real. Everyone =\r\nwho sees comes to the conclusion that all forms are real.\nBut the first ste=\r\np in the process of coming to this conclusion is the\nmistaken impression th=\r\nat the body is the Self.\n\nTrue knowledge begins with the understanding that=\r\n the body is not the Self.\nIn truth, the Self is formless, so whatever is s=\r\neen is for that very reason\nnot the Self. Though the Self is indubitably re=\r\nal, that reality is instead\nascribed to the body. So, a part of the world i=\r\ns mistakenly concluded to be\nreal. This and the succeeding verses are a com=\r\nmentary on the fourth verse of\nUlladu Narpadu.\n\n106 Therefore all forms are=\r\n unreal. To the sage they are not real. What\nreally exists is formless. In =\r\nright awareness nothing has form.This is\nfurther explained as follows:\n\n107=\r\n By a single act of vision the ignorant man sees both himself and the\nworld=\r\n as forms. Since this seeing is illusory, there is no evidence to prove\ntha=\r\nt the world is real.\n\n108 One=E2=80=99s own body and the world are one [ind=\r\nivisible] spectacle; either\nthey are both seen together, or they are both n=\r\not seen. Does anyone see this\nworld without at the same time seeing the bod=\r\ny, which is the form ascribed\nto the Self?\n\nThis fact, that neither the bod=\r\ny, nor the world, is seen apart from the\nother, is something we have never =\r\nnoticed before. We come to know of it for\nthe first time only when the fact=\r\n is pointed out by Bhagavan. Since the Self\nis really formless, the whole s=\r\npectacle is suspect, since it is indivisible.\n\nIt may be objected that we s=\r\nee the dream world without a body. The answer to\nthis follows.\n\n109 If it i=\r\ns said that we see the dream world without bodies, [the response\nis] that t=\r\nhere is a body [for the soul] in all the three states. The soul is\nnever bo=\r\ndiless.\nHere it is the soul that is spoken of, not the Self. The two are no=\r\nt the\nsame in Bhagavan=E2=80=99s teachings, as will be seen in due course. =\r\nThis and the\nsucceeding verses give the meaning of the fifth verse of Ullad=\r\nu Narpadu.\n\n110 Every creature has three bodies, a gross one, a subtle one =\r\nand a causal\none: the mind is the subtle body, and ignorance itself is call=\r\ned the causal\nbody.\n\n111 The three bodies mentioned here are also enumerate=\r\nd as the five sheaths.\nThe middle three sheaths are the [same as the] subtl=\r\ne body, and the last\nsheath is stated to be the causal body.\n\nThe gross phy=\r\nsical body is identical with the first of the five sheaths,\ncalled the food=\r\n-sheath (annamaya kosa) because it is the product of food.\nThis, being obvi=\r\nous, is not stated in the verse.\n\n112 As long as the three bodies remain un=\r\ndissolved by the light of right\nawareness, the soul will be embodied. [Only=\r\n] in the supreme state, wherein\nall the three are together lost, will there=\r\n be bodilessness.\n\n113 The mind, by its own force of ignorance, itself crea=\r\ntes another body,\nand also another [dream] world. The sleeper who sees this=\r\n dream world along\nwith this dream body is not disembodied.\n\nThus the objec=\r\ntion is overcome.\n\n114 Everyone sees both his own body and the world throug=\r\nh the eye, which is\na part of that very body. How can this seeing be admiss=\r\nible as evidence in\nthis enquiry about the reality of the world?\n\nSince the=\r\n body is a part of the world, its reality is also in question. It\ncannot be=\r\n assumed without proof. But it is so assumed when the eye is\nappealed to as=\r\n a witness to the truth of the world. The question of the\nreality of forms =\r\nis now further pursued.\n\n115 As is the eye, so is the spectacle, since the =\r\nnature of the spectacle\ndepends on that of the seeing eye. If that eye is a=\r\n form, so will be the\nspectacle. But if the eye is the formless [Self], the=\r\nre will be no seeing of\nforms at all.\n\nThis is a law of nature that Bhagava=\r\nn reveals for the first time. Seeing\nwith the eye of flesh, which is a form=\r\n, one sees forms. Seeing with the eye\nof right awareness as the Self, forms=\r\n are not seen. So says Bhagavan. This\nproves that forms are unreal, at leas=\r\nt for the purpose of this philosophy.\n\nThe subject is further elucidated.\n\n=\r\n116 In the state of ignorance both the world and the Self are seen as forms=\r\n.\n[But] on the extinction of ignorance both are [found to be] formless,\nbec=\r\nause in the supreme state the infinite Self is the eye.\n\nIn the true state,=\r\n which is the supreme state, the Self alone is. It is\ndescribed as infinite=\r\n, and therefore formless. There are no objects to be\nseen, nor is there any=\r\n real seeing. Hence, forms are unreal. If they were\nreal, they would surviv=\r\ne in that state.\n\n117 By the vision of right awareness, the world, along wi=\r\nth the soul, merges\ninto the formless, real Self. The sages call that the v=\r\nision of right\nawareness, wherein there is neither seer nor spectacle.\n\n118=\r\n In that natural state [of the Self] there survives only the Self, which\nis=\r\n consciousness, worldless, alone, and without the six modes of change,\nsuch=\r\n as birth, and so on. Hence, it alone is real in its own right.\n\nThe world =\r\nis not real in its own right; it has only a borrowed reality, as\nwill becom=\r\ne clear later on.\n\n119 That Supreme Being, the Self, which is perfect as th=\r\ne sole reality, is\nstyled the infinite eye. However, because for that Self =\r\nin its true state\nthere are no objects to be seen, it is not [really] an ey=\r\ne.\n\n120 The term =E2=80=98eye=E2=80=99 has been used in this context by the=\r\n most holy one\n[Bhagavan] only to ward off the misconception that it is non=\r\n-consciousness,\n[inert]. Thus, the most holy one has conveyed the meaning t=\r\nhat the Self is\nconsciousness and the sole reality.\n\n121 It is only by conc=\r\neiving the formless Self as a form that one sees this\nworld as consisting o=\r\nf forms. All this is really an ignorant superimposition\non the formless, in=\r\nfinite reality, the Self.\n\n122 It is only to him that sees himself as havin=\r\ng a form that the names and\nforms appear as real. They have been fabricated=\r\n by ignorance and\nsuperimposed on the nameless, formless Self, which is con=\r\nsciousness.\n\n123 Thus it has been made plain by the Master that the seeing =\r\nof the world\nis an effect of the primary ignorance. Thus, the claim that th=\r\ne world is\nreal has been refuted by him. Also, it has been shown by him tha=\r\nt the\naloneness of the real Self in the true state is real.\n\n124 Our Master=\r\n confirms this teaching first by showing that the world is\nmental [insepara=\r\nble from the mind], then by proving the unreality of the\nmind and the ego, =\r\nand finally by teaching that even the primary ignorance is\nnon-existent.\n\nT=\r\nhe next verse shows that the world does not exist apart from the mind, and\n=\r\nis therefore mental.\n\n125 The world is a totality of the five kinds of sens=\r\nations, namely sounds\nand the rest, and nothing else. All these are only me=\r\nntal impressions.\nHence, the world is nothing but the mind.\n\n126 If the wor=\r\nld were other than the mind, why does it not appear in deep\nsleep? Therein =\r\nis the real Self, which is consciousness, and by whose\nconsciousness-light =\r\nthe mind is mind!\n\nThe second half of the verse is an answer to the content=\r\nion, which may be\nraised by the other side, that the non-seeing of the worl=\r\nd in deep sleep is\nno argument, because it is due to the absence of the min=\r\nd and the senses of\nperception in that state. The mind is not conscious by =\r\nits own nature; its\nconsciousness is derived from association with the real=\r\n Self. Since that\nSelf survives in deep sleep, the objection is invalid. Th=\r\nis reason finds a\nplace in Sri Sankaracharya=E2=80=99s Viveka Chudamani: =\r\n=E2=80=98If the world is real, why\nthen, let it be seen in deep sleep! Sinc=\r\ne it is not at all seen in it, it is\ntherefore unreal, like a dream.=E2=80=\r\n=99\n\n127 Only when their minds are functioning does the world appear to men=\r\n.\nTherefore, the world in the waking state is mental, as it is in dream.Thi=\r\ns\nparallel between the waking and the dream states is elaborated in the nex=\r\nt\nverse.\n\n128 Just like the waking world, the dream world seems real during=\r\n the dream.\nAlso, just like the waking world, the dream world, in its own t=\r\nime, is\nserviceable [for the purposes of life].\n\nThe conclusion is stated i=\r\nn the following verse.\n\n129 Just as the dream world is not other than the m=\r\nind of the dreamer, so\nthe world of things, seen in waking, is not other th=\r\nan the mind of the seer.\n\nObjections to this conclusion are then noticed.\n\n=\r\n130 Fearing that if it is concluded that the world is mental, then its\nunre=\r\nality will be an inescapable conclusion, ignorant [sectarians] seek to\nprov=\r\ne in a variety of ways that the world exists outside [as an independent\nrea=\r\nlity].\n\nThat these disputants have no locus standi in this discussion is fi=\r\nrst\nshown.\n\n131 The truth that the world is unreal is taught by the sages o=\r\nnly to him\nwho aspires to attain the highest state by the quest of the Self=\r\n. It is not\naddressed to others, and hence the contentions of these objecti=\r\nons are\nwholly in vain.\n\nThe uniqueness of Vedanta is that no one is coerce=\r\nd by threats of hell or\notherwise to accept its highly elusive teachings. I=\r\nt is given out only to\nthose whose minds are ripe and have become receptive=\r\n to these metaphysical\ntruths. Indeed, Vedanta advises ordinary people not =\r\nto dabble in vedantic\nstudies. Vedanta makes a distinction between those wh=\r\no are qualified to\nreceive its advaitic teaching and those who are not qual=\r\nified. This is\ncalled the adhikara vada.\n\nThe difficulty in accepting the v=\r\nedantic standpoint is pointed out next.\n\nSource: http://www.davidgodman.org=\r\n/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=\r\n=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=\r\n=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd25cae4d855f049f200482\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;103 Bhagavan, our Guru, has sai=\r\nd: =E2=80=98The world laughs at the ignorant man, saying, =E2=80=9CHow can =\r\nyou know me properly unless you know yourself correctly?=E2=80=9D=E2=80=99&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;By this it is meant that the disciple must be humble, knowing the li=\r\nmitations of his own intelligence.

Therefore, th=\r\ne objector=E2=80=99s argument =E2=80=93 that the world is real because he s=\r\nees it =E2=80=93 does not avail to prove his contention.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The ignor=\r\nant man=E2=80=99s vision of the world is vitiated by the fact of his ignora=\r\nnce of his own real Self. This point has been repeatedly pointed out by Bha=\r\ngavan.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;To know the world aright, one =\r\nmust first know oneself aright.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The verses that follow show=\r\n how the seeing of the world is affected and falsified by the primary ignor=\r\nance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;105 Every creature first identifies his own Self with the body=\r\n, and thereby concludes that the body is real.

So, a part of the world is mistakenly concluded to b=\r\ne real. This and the succeeding verses are a commentary on the fourth verse=\r\n of Ulladu Narpadu.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;106 Therefore=\r\n all forms are unreal.

Does anyone see this world witho=\r\nut at the same time seeing the body, which is the form ascribed to the Self=\r\n?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This fact, that neither the body, nor the world, is seen apart f=\r\nrom the other, is something we have never noticed before. We come to know o=\r\nf it for the first time only when the fact is pointed out by Bhagavan. Sinc=\r\ne the Self is really formless, the whole spectacle is suspect, since it is =\r\nindivisible.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It may be objected that we see the dream world withou=\r\nt a body. The answer to this follows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;109 If it is said that we see =\r\nthe dream world without bodies, [the response is] that there is a body [for=\r\n the soul] in all the three states. The soul is never bodiless.&lt;br&gt;\n\nHere i=\r\nt is the soul that is spoken of, not the Self. The two are not the same in =\r\nBhagavan=E2=80=99s teachings, as will be seen in due course. This and the s=\r\nucceeding verses give the meaning of the fifth verse of Ulladu Narpadu.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;110 Every creature has three bodies,=\r\n a gross one, a subtle one and a causal one: the mind is the subtle body, a=\r\nnd ignorance itself is called the causal body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;111 The three =\r\nbodies mentioned here are also enumerated as the five sheaths. The middle t=\r\nhree sheaths are the [same as the] subtle body, and the last sheath is stat=\r\ned to be the causal body.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The gro=\r\nss physical body is identical with the first of the five sheaths, called th=\r\ne food-sheath (annamaya kosa) because it is the product of food. This, bein=\r\ng obvious, is not stated in the verse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;112 As long as the t=\r\nhree bodies remain undissolved by the light of right awareness, the soul wi=\r\nll be embodied. [Only] in the supreme state, wherein all the three are toge=\r\nther lost, will there be bodilessness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n113 The mind, by its own for=\r\nce of ignorance, itself creates another body, and also another [dream] worl=\r\nd. The sleeper who sees this dream world along with this dream body is not =\r\ndisembodied.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Thus the objection is overcome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;114 Everyone se=\r\nes both his own body and the world through the eye, which is a part of that=\r\n very body. How can this seeing be admissible as evidence in this enquiry a=\r\nbout the reality of the world?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Since the body is a part of the wor=\r\nld, its reality is also in question. It cannot be assumed without proof. Bu=\r\nt it is so assumed when the eye is appealed to as a witness to the truth of=\r\n the world. The question of the reality of forms is now further pursued.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;115 As is the eye, so is the spectacle, since the nature of the spec=\r\ntacle depends on that of the seeing eye. If that eye is a form, so will be =\r\nthe spectacle. But if the eye is the formless [Self], there will be no seei=\r\nng of forms at all.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This is a law of nature that Bhagavan reveals =\r\nfor the first time. Seeing with the eye of flesh, which is a form, one sees=\r\n forms. Seeing with the eye of right awareness as the Self, forms are not s=\r\neen. So says Bhagavan. This proves that forms are unreal, at least for the =\r\npurpose of this philosophy.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The subject is further elucidated.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;116 In the state of ignorance both the=\r\n world and the Self are seen as forms. [But] on the extinction of ignorance=\r\n both are [found to be] formless, because in the supreme state the infinite=\r\n Self is the eye.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;In the true state, which is the supreme s=\r\ntate, the Self alone is. It is described as infinite, and therefore formles=\r\ns. There are no objects to be seen, nor is there any real seeing. Hence, fo=\r\nrms are unreal. If they were real, they would survive in that state.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;117 By the vision of right awareness, the world, along with the soul, me=\r\nrges into the formless, real Self. The sages call that the vision of right =\r\nawareness, wherein there is neither seer nor spectacle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;118 In that =\r\nnatural state [of the Self] there survives only the Self, which is consciou=\r\nsness, worldless, alone, and without the six modes of change, such as birth=\r\n, and so on. Hence, it alone is real in its own right.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The world i=\r\ns not real in its own right; it has only a borrowed reality, as will become=\r\n clear later on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;119 That Supreme Being, the Self, which is perfect =\r\nas the sole reality, is styled the infinite eye. However, because for that =\r\nSelf in its true state there are no objects to be seen, it is not [really] =\r\nan eye.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;120 The term =E2=80=98eye=E2=80=99 has been used in this c=\r\nontext by the most holy one [Bhagavan] only to ward off the misconception t=\r\nhat it is non-consciousness, [inert]. Thus, the most holy one has conveyed =\r\nthe meaning that the Self is consciousness and the sole reality.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;1=\r\n21 It is only by conceiving the formless Self as a form that one sees this =\r\nworld as consisting of forms. All this is really an ignorant superimpositio=\r\nn on the formless, infinite reality, the Self.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-w=\r\neight:bold&quot;&gt;122 It is only to him that sees himself as having a form that t=\r\nhe names and forms appear as real. They have been fabricated by ignorance a=\r\nnd superimposed on the nameless, formless Self, which is consciousness.&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;123 Thus it has been made plain by the Master that the seeing =\r\nof the world is an effect of the primary ignorance. Thus, the claim that th=\r\ne world is real has been refuted by him. Also, it has been shown by him tha=\r\nt the aloneness of the real Self in the true state is real.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;124 Ou=\r\nr Master confirms this teaching first by showing that the world is mental [=\r\ninseparable from the mind], then by proving the unreality of the mind and t=\r\nhe ego, and finally by teaching that even the primary ignorance is non-exis=\r\ntent.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The next verse shows that the world does not exist apart fro=\r\nm the mind, and is therefore mental.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold=\r\n&quot;&gt;125 The world is a totality of the five kinds of sensations, namely sound=\r\ns and the rest, and nothing else. All these are only mental impressions. He=\r\nnce, the world is nothing but the mind.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;126 If the world were othe=\r\nr than the mind, why does it not appear in deep sleep? Therein is the real =\r\nSelf, which is consciousness, and by whose consciousness-light the mind is =\r\nmind!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second half of the verse is an answer to the conten=\r\ntion, which may be raised by the other side, that the non-seeing of the wor=\r\nld in deep sleep is no argument, because it is due to the absence of the mi=\r\nnd and the senses of perception in that state. The mind is not conscious by=\r\n its own nature; its consciousness is derived from association with the rea=\r\nl Self. Since that Self survives in deep sleep, the objection is invalid. T=\r\nhis reason finds a place in Sri Sankaracharya=E2=80=99s Viveka Chudamani: =\r\n=E2=80=98If the world is real, why then, let it be seen in deep sleep! Sinc=\r\ne it is not at all seen in it, it is therefore unreal, like a dream.=E2=80=\r\n=99&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;127 Only when their minds are functioning does the world appea=\r\nr to men. Therefore, the world in the waking state is mental, as it is in d=\r\nream.This parallel between the waking and the dream states is elaborated in=\r\n the next verse.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;128 Just like th=\r\ne waking world, the dream world seems real during the dream. Also, just lik=\r\ne the waking world, the dream world, in its own time, is serviceable [for t=\r\nhe purposes of life].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The conclusion is stated in the follo=\r\nwing verse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;129 Just as the dream w=\r\norld is not other than the mind of the dreamer, so the world of things, see=\r\nn in waking, is not other than the mind of the seer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Object=\r\nions to this conclusion are then noticed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;130 Fearing that if it is =\r\nconcluded that the world is mental, then its unreality will be an inescapab=\r\nle conclusion, ignorant [sectarians] seek to prove in a variety of ways tha=\r\nt the world exists outside [as an independent reality].&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;That these=\r\n disputants have no locus standi in this discussion is first shown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n131 The truth that the world is unreal is taught by the sages only to him w=\r\nho aspires to attain the highest state by the quest of the Self. It is not =\r\naddressed to others, and hence the contentions of these objections are whol=\r\nly in vain.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The uniqueness of Vedanta is that no one is coerced by=\r\n threats of hell or otherwise to accept its highly elusive teachings. It is=\r\n given out only to those whose minds are ripe and have become receptive to =\r\nthese metaphysical truths. Indeed, Vedanta advises ordinary people not to d=\r\nabble in vedantic studies. Vedanta makes a distinction between those who ar=\r\ne qualified to receive its advaitic teaching and those who are not qualifie=\r\nd. This is called the adhikara vada.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The difficulty in accepting t=\r\nhe vedantic standpoint is pointed out next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weig=\r\nht:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_in=\r\ntro.shtml&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.sh=\r\ntml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:both;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bott=\r\nom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;co=\r\nlor:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:87%;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bo=\r\nttom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=\r\n=B0=93=E0=B0=82=C2=A0 =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B=C2=A0 =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=\r\n=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80=C2=\r\n=A0 =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF=C2=A0=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=\r\n=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=C2=A0 =\r\n=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd25cae4d855f049f200482--\r\n\n"}}
