This resulted in an intimate relationship and frank\ndia=\r\nlogues on many subjects, including the practical application of the\nMaharsh=\r\ni&#39;s teachings.\n\nThe rare devotion Devaraja Mudaliar developed for the Mahar=\r\nshi eventually\ncompelled him to leave his home and profession and settle do=\r\nwn in Sri\nRamanasramam in 1942. His four years of tenancy at the Ashrama se=\r\ncured for\nposterity invaluable records in the form of a diary, subsequently=\r\n published\nas Day By Day with Bhagavan. Later, his written reminiscences fo=\r\nrmed the\nbook entitled My Recollections, which was the source for the follo=\r\nwing\narticle.\n\nDevaraja Mudaliar, at the ripe age of 85, was absorbed in hi=\r\ns Master in\n1972.\n\nTHE EARLIEST recollection I have of Bhagavan dates back =\r\nto 1900. Along with\nsome of my relations, I went to Tiruvannamalai for the =\r\nDeepam festival. Even\nas early as that, the crowds that came for Deepa dars=\r\nhan used to visit our\nBhagavan, then popularly known as Brahmana Swami.\n\nI =\r\ndid not visit him again until 1914, two years after I came to Chittoor and\n=\r\nsettled down there to practise as a lawyer. Kuppuswami Mudaliar accompanied=\r\n\nme on my visit. We arrived at about 2 o&#39;clock in the afternoon and found\nB=\r\nhagavan sitting on the parapet wall outside Virupakshi Cave. So far I can\nr=\r\nemember there was no one else there at that time. There were only a few\nmon=\r\nkeys near Bhagavan, and he started telling me about them, their ways,\ntheir=\r\n government, kings, queens, etc. I stayed nearly two hours and the\nwhole ti=\r\nme was spent in listening to these stories about monkeys. I was\nstill a you=\r\nng man and did not take seriously to the spiritual side of life,\nso I did n=\r\not ask Bhagavan for any spiritual guidance. I was satisfied with\nhaving see=\r\nn him and talked to him.\n\nIt was made possible for me to visit Bhagavan aga=\r\nin about the end of 1922.\nBy this time Bhagavan&#39;s mother had attained Mahas=\r\namadhi and Bhagavan had\ncome to live near the mother&#39;s samadhi (grave) at t=\r\nhe foot of the hill where\nSri Ramanasramam now stands. There was a small th=\r\natched shed housing the\nsamadhi, where the temple now stands, and to the no=\r\nrth of the samadhi was a\nnarrow pial, or raised floor, on which Bhagavan us=\r\ned to sit or lie down.\n\nI told Bhagavan that, though I went to temples like=\r\n other people, they did\nnot much appeal to me and asked Bhagavan what he wo=\r\nuld advise me to do. He\nreplied: &quot;That does not matter. Think of God as bei=\r\nng in your heart and\nmeditate on God that way. That will be enough.&quot;\n\nThe e=\r\nnd of 1933 saw my first long stay of nearly a week at Bhagavan&#39;s feet\nand h=\r\nis presence was such a balm to my stricken heart that from that visit\ndates=\r\n my intimate and close association with him.\n\nIt is said that man&#39;s adversi=\r\nty is God&#39;s opportunity. Bhagavan proved a\ngreat solace to me when I lost m=\r\ny wife in 1933 (I was then 47). So\nnaturally, when the next misfortune came=\r\n, in 1935, I threw myself even more\ncompletely on Bhagavan, going to him as=\r\n often as possible and basking in his\npresence.\n\nI lost my job as Governmen=\r\nt Pleader and Public Prosecutor which I had held\nfor fifteen years (that is=\r\n for five successive terms). In my then\ncircumstances, this was a great mis=\r\nfortune, and it was a serious problem\nwith me how I was going to make both =\r\nends meet after losing a steady,\nassured income of about Rs. 6,000 a year t=\r\no which I had been accustomed for\nfifteen years. I mention the gravity of t=\r\nhis crisis only to indicate that it\ndrove me to lean more and more upon Bha=\r\ngavan.\n\nI decided about 1939, that I would give up practice completely in 1=\r\n941, wind\nup my establishment at Chittoor and go and live with Bhagavan at =\r\nthe Ashrama\nfor the rest of my life. I asked and received permission to bui=\r\nld a one-room\ncottage inside the Ashrama premises. Such permission was rare=\r\nly given, in\nfact it was given only to two others, namely, Major Chadwick a=\r\nnd Yogi\nRamiah. The room was ready for me by June 1940.\n\nIt was about the e=\r\nnd of August 1942, I think, that I went to live at Sri\nRamanasramam as a pe=\r\nrmanent inmate. However, for some little time more, I\nhad to go to Chittoor=\r\n now and then in connection with remaining professional\nwork or my private =\r\naffairs.\n\nWhen I had resided in the Ashrama I gradually made a routine to s=\r\ning for\nabout half an hour between 10 and 11 in the morning, that is for th=\r\ne last\ntwenty minutes or half hour between when Bhagavan had finished going=\r\n through\nthe second mail and when the gong went for lunch. Bhagavan saw tha=\r\nt this was\nmy line of approach and was doing me good. Therefore he took car=\r\ne, by the\nsilent working of his grace, that nobody interfered with it.\n\nIn =\r\nthe early days Bhagavan encouraged me whenever I was singing with deep\nfeel=\r\ning. He would have such a look on his face, with his radiant eyes\ndirected =\r\ntowards me, that I would be held spellbound, and not infrequently,\nat some =\r\nespecially moving words in the songs, tears would come and I would\nbe oblig=\r\ned to stop reciting for one or two minutes. Bhagavan told me that\nsuch weep=\r\ning is good, quoting from Thiruvachakam: &quot;By crying for You (God),\none can =\r\nget you.&quot;\n\nThis seems an appropriate place for referring to another well kn=\r\nown\ncharacteristic of Bhagavan. To those who have only a very superficial\nk=\r\nnowledge of him or his works, it might seem that he was a cold,\nrelentlessl=\r\ny logical, unemotional Jnani, far removed from the Bhakta who\nmelts into te=\r\nars in contemplation of God&#39;s grace and love. But to those who\nhad any real=\r\n experience of Bhagavan and his ways, and works, it was clear\nthat he was a=\r\ns much a Bhakta as a Jnani. Often he has told us that only a\ntrue Bhakta ca=\r\nn be a true Jnani and that only a true Jnani can be a true\nBhakta. The comp=\r\nlete extinction of the ego is the end attained either in\njnana or bhakti.\n\n=\r\nWhen touching songs were recited or read out before him, or when he himself=\r\n\nwas reading out to us poems or passages from the lives or works of famous\n=\r\nsaints, he would be moved to tears and would find it impossible to restrain=\r\n\nthem. He would be reading out and explaining some passage and when he came=\r\n\nto a very moving part he would get so choked with emotion that he could no=\r\nt\ncontinue but would lay aside the book.\n\nBefore taking leave of this topic=\r\n, I must remark that it was not only any\nmoving song about God that had thi=\r\ns effect on him but anything grand,\nmagnanimous, noble or generous moved hi=\r\nm as few people could be moved. I was\noften reminded of the sentence, &quot;The =\r\nfinest minds, like the finest metals,\ndissolve the easiest.&quot;\n\nMany times I =\r\ncomplained to Bhagavan that I was not making any appreciable\nprogress, bemo=\r\naning the persistence of desires. Bhagavan replied making\nlight of my troub=\r\nle: &quot;It will all go, all in time. You need not worry. The\nmore dhyana (medi=\r\ntation) one performs the more will these desires fall off.&quot;\n\nOn other occas=\r\nions when I complained that I was not improving, Bhagavan\nsimply replied, &quot;=\r\nHow do you know?&quot;\n\nBhagavan, from what little I know of him, was not one wh=\r\no believed in\nforcing the pace. On the contrary, he gave me the impression =\r\nthat he felt it\nwas not proper and was not for our real good, that he shoul=\r\nd interfere and\ndo violence to our nature or Prakriti by hurrying us at a f=\r\naster pace than\nwe are built for, even towards realisation.\n\nOnce I had pla=\r\nnned to carry out something in conjunction with someone else\nwho was then s=\r\ntaying permanently near the Ashrama. Neither at the time, nor\neven now acco=\r\nrding to my lights, was there anything so very objectionable\nabout what we =\r\nhad planned. But suddenly one afternoon, out of a trivial and\naltogether in=\r\nadequate circumstance, a quarrel arose between us and what we\nintended was =\r\ncalled off. The next morning I happened to be sitting very near\nBhagavan&#39;s =\r\ncouch, at his feet, and Bhagavan, apropos of nothing in\nparticular and with=\r\n an expression of love and pity, turned to me and said in\na low voice: &quot;We =\r\nshould not make elaborate plans to get anything. I don&#39;t\nobject to your enj=\r\noying what comes your way of its own accord.&quot;\n\nThen I knew beyond all doubt=\r\n that it was Bhagavan who, foreseeing some harm\nfor me in what I had planne=\r\nd, brought about the sudden and unexpected\nquarrel the previous afternoon a=\r\nnd aborted our plans. When Bhagavan told me\nthis, I asked him, &quot;Does that m=\r\nean that if a thing comes to me without any\nplanning or working for it and =\r\nI enjoy it, there will be no bad consequences\nfrom it?&quot;\n\nBhagavan then hast=\r\nened to add: &quot;It is not so,&quot; and explained: &quot;Every act\nmust have its conseq=\r\nuences. If anything comes your way, by reason of\nprarabdha (destiny based o=\r\nn the balance sheet of past lives) you can&#39;t help\nit. If you take what come=\r\ns, without any special attachment and without any\ndesire for more of it or =\r\nfor a repetition of it, it will not harm you by\nleading to further births. =\r\nOn the other hand, if you enjoy it with great\nattachment and naturally desi=\r\nre for more of it, that is bound to lead to\nmore and more births.&quot;\n\nAbout w=\r\nork, Bhagavan used to say: &quot;No sort of work is a hindrance on the\nspiritual=\r\n path. It is the notion &#39;I am the doer&#39; that is the hindrance. If\nyou get r=\r\nid of that by enquiring and finding out who is this &#39;I&#39;, then work\nwill be =\r\nno hindrance since you will be doing it without the ego sense that\nyou are =\r\nthe doer and without any attachment to the fruits of your work. Work\nwill g=\r\no on even more efficiently than before; but you can always be in your\nown, =\r\nnatural, permanent state of peace and bliss. Further, one should not\nworry =\r\nabout whether one should engage in work or give it up. If work is what\nis o=\r\nrdained for one, one will not escape it, however much one may try. On\nthe o=\r\nther hand, if no work is ordained for one, one will not obtain work\nhowever=\r\n much one wishes to strive for it.&quot;\n\nOne summer afternoon I was sitting opp=\r\nosite Bhagavan in the old hall, with a\nfan in my hand and said to him: &quot;I c=\r\nan understand that the outstanding\nevents in a man&#39;s life, such as his coun=\r\ntry, nationality, family, career or\nprofession, marriage, death, etc., are =\r\nall predestined by his karma, but can\nit be that all the details of his lif=\r\ne, down to the minutest, have already\nbeen determined? Now, for instance, I=\r\n put this fan that is in my hand down\non the floor here. Can it be that it =\r\nwas already decided that on such and\nsuch a day, at such and a such an hour=\r\n, I shall move the fan like this and\nput it down here?&quot;\n\nBhagavan replied, =\r\n&quot;Certainly.&quot; He continued: &quot;Whatever this body is to do\nand whatever experi=\r\nences it is to pass through was already decided when it\ncame into existence=\r\n.&quot;\n\nThereupon I naturally exclaimed: &quot;What becomes then of man&#39;s freedom an=\r\nd\nresponsibility for his actions?&quot;\n\nBhagavan explained: &quot;The only freedom m=\r\nan has is to strive for and acquire\nthe jnana which will enable him not to =\r\nidentify himself with the body. The\nbody will go through the actions render=\r\ned inevitable by prarabdha and a man\nis free either to identify himself wit=\r\nh the body and be attached to the\nfruits of its actions, or to be detached =\r\nfrom it and be a mere witness of\nits activities.&quot;\n\nThis may not be acceptab=\r\nle to many learned people or philosophers. I recall\nin this connection the =\r\nfollowing lines that Bhagavan once quoted to me from\nThayumanavar on anothe=\r\nr occasion: &quot;This is not to be taught to all. Even if\nwe tell them, it will=\r\n only lead to endless discussion.&quot;\n\nIt may be well to remind readers that B=\r\nhagavan has given his classic answer\nto the age-old question &quot;Can free will=\r\n conquer fate?&quot; as follows in his\nForty Verses: &quot;Such questions worry only =\r\nthose who have not found the source\nof both free will and fate. Those who h=\r\nave found this source have left all\nsuch discussions behind.&quot;\n\nA lady Princ=\r\nipal asked Bhagavan whether it was not better for people to work\nand do som=\r\nething for the betterment of the world than to sit in\ncontemplation, aloof =\r\nfrom the world, seeking for their own salvation. This\nwas not by any means =\r\na new question and Bhagavan had given a very clear\nanswer to it which has a=\r\nlready been published in the Maharshi&#39;s Gospel. In\nbrief, it is that one Jn=\r\nani by his Self-realisation is doing much more for\nthe world than all socia=\r\nl workers put together and that his silence is more\neloquent and effective =\r\nthan the words of orators and writers advocating any\ncourses for man. On th=\r\nis occasion, however, Bhagavan remained silent. When\nthe lady found that Bh=\r\nagavan did not answer, she went on speaking for some\nten minutes. Even then=\r\n Bhagavan remained silent. The lady and her sister\nthen left in chagrin.\n\nA=\r\nfter they had left Bhagavan said to me: &quot;It is no use telling them\nanything=\r\n. The only result would be that it would be published in the papers\nthat su=\r\nch and such are the views of so and so and there will be endless\ndispute. T=\r\nhe best thing is to keep quiet.&quot;\n\nHis view on the attempts, however well in=\r\ntentioned, by idealistic reformers,\nwhether socialist or communist or whate=\r\nver label they may wear, to make all\npeople equally well-placed in life can=\r\n be epitomized as follows: &quot;There\nnever was and never will be a time when a=\r\nll are equally happy or rich or\nwise or healthy. In fact none of these term=\r\ns has any meaning except in so\nfar as the opposite to it exists. But that d=\r\noes not mean that when you come\nacross anyone who is less happy or more mis=\r\nerable than yourself, you are not\nto be moved to compassion or to seek to r=\r\nelieve him as best you can. On the\ncontrary, you must love all and help all=\r\n, since only in that way can you\nhelp yourself. When you seek to reduce the=\r\n suffering of any fellow-man or\nfellow-creature, whether your efforts do su=\r\ncceed or not, you are yourself\nevolving spiritually thereby, especially if =\r\nsuch service is rendered\ndisinterestedly, not with the egoistic feeling &#39;I =\r\nam doing this&#39;, but in the\nspirit &#39;God is making me the channel of this ser=\r\nvice; He is the doer and I\nthe instrument&#39;.&quot; On two successive days, in ans=\r\nwer to questions from\nvisitors, Bhagavan said in effect what I have summari=\r\nsed above.\n\nMost of the time I lived with Bhagavan, I used to feel peaceful=\r\n and\nabsolutely free from care. That, as many can testify, was the outstand=\r\ning\neffect of his presence. Nevertheless, it did occasionally happen that\ns=\r\nomething disturbed the peace and happiness for a while. On one such\noccasio=\r\nn I asked Bhagavan: &quot;Why do such interruptions come? Does it mean\nthat we h=\r\nave ceased to have Bhagavan&#39;s grace then?&quot;\n\nWith what graciousness did Bhag=\r\navan reply: &quot;You crazy fellow! The trouble or\nwant of peace comes only beca=\r\nuse of grace.&quot;\n\nOn other occasions also Bhagavan has similarly told me: &quot;Yo=\r\nu people are glad\nand grateful to God when things you regard as good come t=\r\no you. That is\nright, but you should be equally grateful when things you re=\r\ngard as bad come\nto you. That is where you fail.&quot;\n\nHere I must say the only=\r\n method I have adopted to achieve liberation or\nSelf-realisation is simply =\r\nto throw myself on Bhagavan, to surrender to him\nas completely as lies in m=\r\ny power, and to leave everything else to him. And\nBhagavan&#39;s teaching, the =\r\nlast I ever got from him before he attained\nMahasamadhi, was just this: &quot;Yo=\r\nur business is simply to surrender and leave\neverything to me. If one reall=\r\ny surrenders completely, there is no room for\nhim to complain that the Guru=\r\n has not done this or that.&quot;\n\nTo me and a number of other devotees of Bhaga=\r\nvan, he was God and all in all.\nWe felt as Saint Arunagirinathar felt when =\r\nhe declared to Lord Muruga:\n\n&quot;I rely on none except you and will follow non=\r\ne except you.&quot; I have often\nsung this song before Bhagavan, altering the la=\r\nst two lines in such a way\nthat they would refer to Bhagavan, instead of to=\r\n Muruga. But about\nwhomsoever we sang, whichever temple we visited, or what=\r\never image we\nworshipped our homage always went to Bhagavan.\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=\r\n=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=\r\n=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd138a0ab95c4048287c1dc\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nA.Devaraja Mudaliar had a unique, innate ability to associate wi=\r\nth the Maharshi in an entirely natural manner, while yet maintaining comple=\r\nte faith and devotion to him. This resulted in an intimate relationship and=\r\n frank dialogues on many subjects, including the practical application of t=\r\nhe Maharshi&#39;s teachings.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The rare devotion Devaraja Mudaliar d=\r\neveloped for the Maharshi eventually compelled him to leave his home and pr=\r\nofession and settle down in Sri Ramanasramam in 1942. His four years of ten=\r\nancy at the Ashrama secured for posterity invaluable records in the form of=\r\n a diary, subsequently published as Day By Day with Bhagavan. Later, his wr=\r\nitten reminiscences formed the book entitled My Recollections, which was th=\r\ne source for the following article.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Devaraja Mudaliar, at the ripe=\r\n age of 85, was absorbed in his Master in 1972.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE EARLIEST recolle=\r\nction I have of Bhagavan dates back to 1900.

Kuppuswami Mudaliar accompanied me on my visit. We arrived at =\r\nabout 2 o&#39;clock in the afternoon and found Bhagavan sitting on the para=\r\npet wall outside Virupakshi Cave. So far I can remember there was no one el=\r\nse there at that time. There were only a few monkeys near Bhagavan, and he =\r\nstarted telling me about them, their ways, their government, kings, queens,=\r\n etc. I stayed nearly two hours and the whole time was spent in listening t=\r\no these stories about monkeys. I was still a young man and did not take ser=\r\niously to the spiritual side of life, so I did not ask Bhagavan for any spi=\r\nritual guidance. I was satisfied with having seen him and talked to him.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It was made possible for me to visit Bhagavan again about the end of=\r\n 1922.

He replied: &quot;That d=\r\noes not matter. Think of God as being in your heart and meditate on God tha=\r\nt way. That will be enough.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The end of 1933 saw my fi=\r\nrst long stay of nearly a week at Bhagavan&#39;s feet and his presence was =\r\nsuch a balm to my stricken heart that from that visit dates my intimate and=\r\n close association with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is said that man&#39;s adversity is =\r\nGod&#39;s opportunity. Bhagavan proved a great solace to me when I lost my =\r\nwife in 1933 (I was then 47). So naturally, when the next misfortune came, =\r\nin 1935, I threw myself even more completely on Bhagavan, going to him as o=\r\nften as possible and basking in his presence.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;I lost my job as Gov=\r\nernment Pleader and Public Prosecutor which I had held for fifteen years (t=\r\nhat is for five successive terms). In my then circumstances, this was a gre=\r\nat misfortune, and it was a serious problem with me how I was going to make=\r\n both ends meet after losing a steady, assured income of about Rs. 6,000 a =\r\nyear to which I had been accustomed for fifteen years. I mention the gravit=\r\ny of this crisis only to indicate that it drove me to lean more and more up=\r\non Bhagavan.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;I decided about 1939, that I would give up practice c=\r\nompletely in 1941, wind up my establishment at Chittoor and go and live wit=\r\nh Bhagavan at the Ashrama for the rest of my life. I asked and received per=\r\nmission to build a one-room cottage inside the Ashrama premises. Such permi=\r\nssion was rarely given, in fact it was given only to two others, namely, Ma=\r\njor Chadwick and Yogi Ramiah. The room was ready for me by June 1940.&lt;br&gt;\n\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;It was about the end of August 1942, I think, that I went to live at Sr=\r\ni Ramanasramam as a permanent inmate. However, for some little time more, I=\r\n had to go to Chittoor now and then in connection with remaining profession=\r\nal work or my private affairs.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;When I had resided in the Ashrama I=\r\n gradually made a routine to sing for about half an hour between 10 and 11 =\r\nin the morning, that is for the last twenty minutes or half hour between wh=\r\nen Bhagavan had finished going through the second mail and when the gong we=\r\nnt for lunch. Bhagavan saw that this was my line of approach and was doing =\r\nme good. Therefore he took care, by the silent working of his grace, that n=\r\nobody interfered with it.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;In the early days Bhagavan encouraged me=\r\n whenever I was singing with deep feeling. He would have such a look on his=\r\n face, with his radiant eyes directed towards me, that I would be held spel=\r\nlbound, and not infrequently, at some especially moving words in the songs,=\r\n tears would come and I would be obliged to stop reciting for one or two mi=\r\nnutes. Bhagavan told me that such weeping is good, quoting from Thiruvachak=\r\nam: &quot;By crying for You (God), one can get you.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This see=\r\nms an appropriate place for referring to another well known characteristic =\r\nof Bhagavan. To those who have only a very superficial knowledge of him or =\r\nhis works, it might seem that he was a cold, relentlessly logical, unemotio=\r\nnal Jnani, far removed from the Bhakta who melts into tears in contemplatio=\r\nn of God&#39;s grace and love. But to those who had any real experience of =\r\nBhagavan and his ways, and works, it was clear that he was as much a Bhakta=\r\n as a Jnani. Often he has told us that only a true Bhakta can be a true Jna=\r\nni and that only a true Jnani can be a true Bhakta.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;fon=\r\nt-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The complete extinction of the ego is the end attained eithe=\r\nr in jnana or bhakti.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;When=\r\n touching songs were recited or read out before him, or when he himself was=\r\n reading out to us poems or passages from the lives or works of famous sain=\r\nts, he would be moved to tears and would find it impossible to restrain the=\r\nm. He would be reading out and explaining some passage and when he came to =\r\na very moving part he would get so choked with emotion that he could not co=\r\nntinue but would lay aside the book.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Before taking leave of=\r\n this topic, I must remark that it was not only any moving song about God t=\r\nhat had this effect on him but anything grand, magnanimous, noble or genero=\r\nus moved him as few people could be moved. I was often reminded of the sent=\r\nence, &quot;The finest minds, like the finest metals, dissolve the easiest.=\r\n&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Many times I complained to Bhagavan that I was not making a=\r\nny appreciable progress, bemoaning the persistence of desires. Bhagavan rep=\r\nlied making light of my trouble: &quot;It will all go, all in time. You nee=\r\nd not worry. The more dhyana (meditation) one performs the more will these =\r\ndesires fall off.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;On other occasions when I complained that =\r\nI was not improving, Bhagavan simply replied, &quot;How do you know?&quot;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan, from what little I know of him, was not one who believed i=\r\nn forcing the pace. On the contrary, he gave me the impression that he felt=\r\n it was not proper and was not for our real good, that he should interfere =\r\nand do violence to our nature or Prakriti by hurrying us at a faster pace t=\r\nhan we are built for, even towards realisation.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Once I had planned=\r\n to carry out something in conjunction with someone else who was then stayi=\r\nng permanently near the Ashrama. Neither at the time, nor even now accordin=\r\ng to my lights, was there anything so very objectionable about what we had =\r\nplanned. But suddenly one afternoon, out of a trivial and altogether inadeq=\r\nuate circumstance, a quarrel arose between us and what we intended was call=\r\ned off. The next morning I happened to be sitting very near Bhagavan&#39;s =\r\ncouch, at his feet, and Bhagavan, apropos of nothing in particular and with=\r\n an expression of love and pity, turned to me and said in a low voice: &quo=\r\nt;We should not make elaborate plans to get anything. I don&#39;t object to=\r\n your enjoying what comes your way of its own accord.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Then I=\r\n knew beyond all doubt that it was Bhagavan who, foreseeing some harm for m=\r\ne in what I had planned, brought about the sudden and unexpected quarrel th=\r\ne previous afternoon and aborted our plans. When Bhagavan told me this, I a=\r\nsked him, &quot;Does that mean that if a thing comes to me without any plan=\r\nning or working for it and I enjoy it, there will be no bad consequences fr=\r\nom it?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan then hastened to add: &quot;It is not so,&qu=\r\not; and explained: &quot;Every act must have its consequences. If anything =\r\ncomes your way, by reason of prarabdha (destiny based on the balance sheet =\r\nof past lives) you can&#39;t help it.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;=\r\n&gt;If you take what comes, without any special attachment and without any des=\r\nire for more of it or for a repetition of it, it will not harm you by leadi=\r\nng to further births. On the other hand, if you enjoy it with great attachm=\r\nent and naturally desire for more of it, that is bound to lead to more and =\r\nmore births.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;About w=\r\nork, Bhagavan used to say: &quot;No sort of work is a hindrance on the spir=\r\nitual path. It is the notion &#39;I am the doer&#39; that is the hindrance.=\r\n If you get rid of that by enquiring and finding out who is this &#39;I&#39=\r\n;, then work will be no hindrance since you will be doing it without the eg=\r\no sense that you are the doer and without any attachment to the fruits of y=\r\nour work.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0Work will go on even more efficiently than before; bu=\r\nt you can always be in your own, natural, permanent state of peace and blis=\r\ns. Further, one should not worry about whether one should engage in work or=\r\n give it up. If work is what is ordained for one, one will not escape it, h=\r\nowever much one may try. On the other hand, if no work is ordained for one,=\r\n one will not obtain work however much one wishes to strive for it.&quot;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;One summer afternoon I was sitting opposite Bhagavan in the old hal=\r\nl, with a fan in my hand and said to him: &quot;I can understand that the o=\r\nutstanding events in a man&#39;s life, such as his country, nationality, fa=\r\nmily, career or profession, marriage, death, etc., are all predestined by h=\r\nis karma, but can it be that all the details of his life, down to the minut=\r\nest, have already been determined? Now, for instance, I put this fan that i=\r\ns in my hand down on the floor here. Can it be that it was already decided =\r\nthat on such and such a day, at such and a such an hour, I shall move the f=\r\nan like this and put it down here?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan replied, &quot;C=\r\nertainly.&quot; He continued: &quot;Whatever this body is to do and whateve=\r\nr experiences it is to pass through was already decided when it came into e=\r\nxistence.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thereupon I naturally exclaimed: &quot;What becomes =\r\nthen of man&#39;s freedom and responsibility for his actions?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Bhagavan explained: &quot;The only freed=\r\nom man has is to strive for and acquire the jnana which will enable him not=\r\n to identify himself with the body. The body will go through the actions re=\r\nndered inevitable by prarabdha and a man is free either to identify himself=\r\n with the body and be attached to the fruits of its actions, or to be detac=\r\nhed from it and be a mere witness of its activities.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\nThis may not be acceptable to many learned people or philosophers. I recall=\r\n in this connection the following lines that Bhagavan once quoted to me fro=\r\nm Thayumanavar on another occasion: &quot;This is not to be taught to all. =\r\nEven if we tell them, it will only lead to endless discussion.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;It may be well to remind readers that=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:ita=\r\nlic&quot;&gt;Bhagavan has given his classic answer to the age-old question &quot;Ca=\r\nn free will conquer fate?&quot; as follows in his Forty Verses: &quot;Such =\r\nquestions worry only those who have not found the source of both free will =\r\nand fate.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Those who have found=\r\n this source have left all such discussions behind.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;A=\r\n lady Principal asked Bhagavan whether it was not better for people to work=\r\n and do something for the betterment of the world than to sit in contemplat=\r\nion, aloof from the world, seeking for their own salvation. This was not by=\r\n any means a new question and Bhagavan had given a very clear answer to it =\r\nwhich has already been published in the Maharshi&#39;s Gospel. In brief, it=\r\n is that one Jnani by his Self-realisation is doing much more for the world=\r\n than all social workers put together and that his silence is more eloquent=\r\n and effective than the words of orators and writers advocating any courses=\r\n for man. On this occasion, however, Bhagavan remained silent. When the lad=\r\ny found that Bhagavan did not answer, she went on speaking for some ten min=\r\nutes. Even then Bhagavan remained silent. The lady and her sister then left=\r\n in chagrin.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;After they had left Bhagavan said to me: &quot;It is =\r\nno use telling them anything. The only result would be that it would be pub=\r\nlished in the papers that such and such are the views of so and so and ther=\r\ne will be endless dispute. The best thing is to keep quiet.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\nHis view on the attempts, however well intentioned, by idealistic reformers=\r\n, whether socialist or communist or whatever label they may wear, to make a=\r\nll people equally well-placed in life can be epitomized as follows: &quot;T=\r\nhere never was and never will be a time when all are equally happy or rich =\r\nor wise or healthy. In fact none of these terms has any meaning except in s=\r\no far as the opposite to it exists. But that does not mean that when you co=\r\nme across anyone who is less happy or more miserable than yourself, you are=\r\n not to be moved to compassion or to seek to relieve him as best you can. O=\r\nn the contrary, you must love all and help all, since only in that way can =\r\nyou help yourself. When you seek to reduce the suffering of any fellow-man =\r\nor fellow-creature, whether your efforts do succeed or not, you are yoursel=\r\nf evolving spiritually thereby, especially if such service is rendered disi=\r\nnterestedly, not with the egoistic feeling &#39;I am doing this&#39;, but i=\r\nn the spirit &#39;God is making me the channel of this service; He is the d=\r\noer and I the instrument&#39;.&quot; On two successive days, in answer to q=\r\nuestions from visitors, Bhagavan said in effect what I have summarised abov=\r\ne.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Most of the time I lived with Bhagavan, I used to feel peaceful=\r\n and absolutely free from care. That, as many can testify, was the outstand=\r\ning effect of his presence. Nevertheless, it did occasionally happen that s=\r\nomething disturbed the peace and happiness for a while. On one such occasio=\r\nn I asked Bhagavan: &quot;Why do such interruptions come? Does it mean that=\r\n we have ceased to have Bhagavan&#39;s grace then?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;With what=\r\n graciousness did Bhagavan reply: &quot;You crazy fellow! The trouble or wa=\r\nnt of peace comes only because of grace.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-w=\r\neight:bold&quot;&gt;On other occasions also Bhagavan has similarly told me: &quot;Y=\r\nou people are glad and grateful to God when things you regard as good come =\r\nto you. That is right, but you should be equally grateful when things you r=\r\negard as bad come to you. That is where you fail.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Her=\r\ne I must say the only method I have adopted to achieve liberation or Self-r=\r\nealisation is simply to throw myself on Bhagavan, to surrender to him as co=\r\nmpletely as lies in my power, and to leave everything else to him. And Bhag=\r\navan&#39;s teaching, the last I ever got from him before he attained Mahasa=\r\nmadhi, was just this: &quot;Your business is simply to surrender and leave =\r\neverything to me. If one really surrenders completely, there is no room for=\r\n him to complain that the Guru has not done this or that.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;To=\r\n me and a number of other devotees of Bhagavan, he was God and all in all. =\r\nWe felt as Saint Arunagirinathar felt when he declared to Lord Muruga:&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&quot;I rely on none except you and will follow none except you.&quot; I=\r\n have often sung this song before Bhagavan, altering the last two lines in =\r\nsuch a way that they would refer to Bhagavan, instead of to Muruga. But abo=\r\nut whomsoever we sang, whichever temple we visited, or whatever image we wo=\r\nrshipped our homage always went to Bhagavan.&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:both;margin=\r\n-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:=\r\n1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:87%;marg=\r\nin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heigh=\r\nt:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82 =C2=A0=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=8B =C2=A0=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =C2=A0=E0=\r\n=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=\r\n=BE=E0=B0=AF =C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=\r\n=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D =C2=A0=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=81 =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd138a0ab95c4048287c1dc--\r\n\n"}}
