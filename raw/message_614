This is an unbelievable experience that =\r\nI \nhave had. I have not added anything from my own. I am writing \nexactly a=\r\ns was happened in my life. I am going back to the period of \n1973/74. Kindl=\r\ny read this only when you are in religious mood.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I was working a=\r\ns telegraphist at Okha Port Post office near \nDwarka. My duty was from 7 am=\r\n to 7 pm and I was getting late fee \nallowance for extra duty. There was a =\r\nTelephone exchange just \nopposite to Post office and due to same Dep=E2=80=\r\n=99t; I had friendship \nwith some Telephone operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Pa=\r\ntel, (we will \ncall him as Mr. Patel) was working as Operator. He was a sta=\r\nunch \ndevotee of=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 shri Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeti=\r\nng him he \nwas always talking about shri Thakur. We came close day by day. =\r\n\nThere was a weekly gathering at his home called SATSANGA. He was \nsinging =\r\ndevotional songs created by him and was weeping while \nsinging. He was read=\r\ning Ramkrishna Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 \nyoungsters were attending this week=\r\nly meeting on Saturday evening. I \nwas then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of =\r\n30 then. We were used to go \nto seashore daily at 7 pm after duty hours and=\r\n were talking only \nabout Thakur.\n&gt; One day when we were at sea shore he su=\r\nddenly told me--\n=E2=80=9CRawalbhai, some guest have come to my home and my=\r\n wife is \nremembering me. My son will come in a few minutes to call me. I \n=\r\nshall have to go now=E2=80=9D. -- And with my surprise his 8 years old son =\r\n\ncame to call him. \n&gt; At one another incident he told me that there will be=\r\n a plane \ncrash tomorrow and that also happened. I was very much impressed =\r\n\nabout him. He could foresee the events. One day I had to go to \nDwarka by =\r\nBus, he told me not to go through bus, as bus tire will be \npunctured. Yet =\r\nI went to Bus station but bus did not come from \nDwarka as was punctured on=\r\n the way. This was surprising.\n&gt; This all incidents made me to believe that=\r\n he had some super power \nand this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I=\r\n was attracted to \nshri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also be discipl=\r\ne of shri \nThakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered =\r\n\nmyself to Thakur at Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s house before Thakur picture. I \npr=\r\nayed him deeply from my heart to accept me as his follower and \nbestow his =\r\ngrace. \n&gt; Next day morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 morning =\r\n\nwhile taking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was waking \nup a=\r\nt 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in the morning that I have \naccepted Shri=\r\n Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife was annoyed and \nshe argued with me a=\r\n lot. =EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CWhy should you take such a hasty \ndecisio=\r\nn? Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kali at \nCalcutta.

I t=\r\nhought-- yes I have \ntaken hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Pa=\r\ntel. --\n&gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was telling=\r\n \ntheir disciples to test him before accepting him. I also decided to \ntest=\r\n Thakur. I immediately told my wife that =EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CSee, M=\r\nr. Patel \nhas never come to our home. You have also not seen him.
