I have moved from one deity to another in the l=\r\nast few \n&gt; years (more so due to different states I found myself in in mate=\r\nrial \n&gt; terms- career problem, delayed marriage, dispute with familial \n&gt; r=\r\nelationships, which somehow inspired/deluded me to change the object of \n&gt; =\r\nmy worship for smooth material existence- hence a very selfish \n&gt; motive/pu=\r\nrpose) and many times I did experience peace of mind while \n&gt; worshipping a=\r\n particular deity, but still shifted due to reasons \n&gt; explained above. Now=\r\n, I find myself worshipping many deities daily \n&gt; (although quality of time=\r\n/devotion to each would be less than if praying \n&gt; to only one deity), but =\r\nI somehow feel good about it everyday, and have \n&gt; started to connect with =\r\na few out of many. Some could say, maybe I am \n&gt; moving ahead in my journey=\r\n, and one fine day, I will relate most \n&gt; emphatically with only one deity,=\r\n and then progress thereon. While, \n&gt; another way to look at it could be th=\r\nat I am relating to some deity due \n&gt; to my long-term connection (worship t=\r\no) with that deity, while \n&gt; connecting with another deity as that could be=\r\n my saviour at present \n&gt; times? (I somehow feel that after I started to wo=\r\nrship a particular \n&gt; deity in the not-so-distant past, and felt positive, =\r\nenergized and \n&gt; hopeful during my worship, my situation improved materiall=\r\ny after a \n&gt; really long period of time, but maybe it is temporary?) I apol=\r\nogize if \n&gt; all this sounds foolish or if I am not making sense. I really w=\r\nish to \n&gt; understand from more elevated beings, such as you. Apart from my =\r\n\n&gt; example, Mr. Nagraj Kota has also mentioned in this same thread that he =\r\n\n&gt; also worships multiple deities as part of his daily sadhana and does not=\r\n \n&gt; find it confusing that one form is different form another. With Mother&#39;=\r\ns \n&gt; grace, he is seemingly at a better place than I am (spiritually \n&gt; spe=\r\naking) and I wish and pray his beautiful journey continues and \n&gt; culminate=\r\ns ever more beautifully. For a confused person like me, how \n&gt; could one ex=\r\nplain this from the diamond analogy?\n&gt; \n&gt; Just one more question, in the di=\r\namond analogy thread, you have \n&gt; mentioned that Vishnu represents the Satt=\r\nva quality of the Supreme \n&gt; Cosmic Being, so by that concept, Vashnavi (Ma=\r\na Lakshmi) would also \n&gt; represent the Sattva quality of the Divine Mother?=\r\n However, yesterday I \n&gt; read someplace while reading about the Divine Moth=\r\ner (since I wanted to \n&gt; read more to suitably prepare/energize myself for =\r\nthe Navratris that \n&gt; started today) that during the Navratris, at some pla=\r\nces (seemingly in \n&gt; South India), the first three days are devoted to Maa =\r\nKali, the next \n&gt; three days to Maa Lakshmi, and the last three days to Maa=\r\n Saraswati, and \n&gt; that this is how, the divine energy works within us, i.e=\r\n, first it \n&gt; destroys the evil tendencies within us (tamasic represented b=\r\ny Maa \n&gt; Kali), then it provides us with spiritual wealth, abundance and \n&gt;=\r\n prosperity (rajasic represented by Maa Lakshmi), and finally it grants \n&gt; =\r\nthe truly liberating Supreme self knowledge leading to Moksha (sattvic \n&gt; r=\r\nepresented by Maa Saraswati) In this concept, the divine energy \n&gt; represen=\r\nting the sattvic quality differs from the one deduced from the \n&gt; diamond e=\r\nxample. Could you please throw some light on this as well?\n&gt; \n&gt; The above m=\r\nay sound superficial questions, and not really relevant to a \n&gt; more evolve=\r\nd sadhaka, however, given my current stage, I will be able to \n&gt; satisfypac=\r\nify these questions/doubts and move forward in my journey more \n&gt; peacefull=\r\ny.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope the Divine Mother grants you all that you wish for, provided, =\r\nthere \n&gt; is anything you wish for, but also (selfishly) hope that by then y=\r\nou \n&gt; would have shared your insights and illuminated many more around you.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Kind regards,\n&gt; Manish\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &lt;j=\r\navascript:parent.wgMail.openComposeWindow(&#39;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&#39;)&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; , &quot;Rama V&quot; &lt;vsra_prasad@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Never mind.

I have seen the diamond example, but not =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the other inputs before.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Unlike the diamond example, here is ano=\r\nther facet I learnt. Lord \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Krsna has 64 qualities while Lord Narayana =\r\nhas 60 qualities only. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Brahman is the effulgence of LordKrsna and the=\r\n ones who follow \n&gt; &gt;&gt; advaita get into a situation of no birth, no death a=\r\nnd merge in the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; brahma jyothi. This is under the rulership of Lord Sa=\r\ndaShiva (the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; supreme to all Sivas). The devotees of Lord Krsna (let u=\r\ns take it as \n&gt; &gt;&gt; dvaita) can have an eternal relationship with Lord servi=\r\nng them (Lord \n&gt; &gt;&gt; is never alone, his hladini shakti as Radharani is alwa=\r\nys with him) \n&gt; &gt;&gt; either as a cow or lotus plant or kadamba tree.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Eve=\r\nn in the example you have given, the facets of diamond are fine. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; But =\r\nwhy do we need to attribute one facet&#39;s relation with the other. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; So, =\r\neither the relations are just an allegory or they are real. If \n&gt; &gt;&gt; they a=\r\nre real, then the relations have to respected as is. It also \n&gt; &gt;&gt; can mean=\r\n, the supreme who has expanded himself or created the rest of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the fac=\r\nets. If it is the latter, there is only one supreme and the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; next ques=\r\ntion is, who is that original ?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Anyways, I am just thinking loud as th=\r\ne stories / allegories look \n&gt; &gt;&gt; good to some extent, beyond which it is t=\r\nough to imagine some \n&gt; &gt;&gt; scenarios. Unless it has been corrupted, Sanatha=\r\nna Dharma has made \n&gt; &gt;&gt; understanding the Lord very difficult.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Lastly=\r\n, I liked Sh Manish&#39;s response to one of my concerns on one of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; these =\r\nkind of questions - &quot;See, don&#39;t care what anyone says; Just do \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sadhan=\r\na like crazy, ok !&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; regards rAma\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;javascript:parent.wgMail.openComposeWindow(&#39;vedic-wisdom@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com&#39;)&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; , Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nNamaste,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; This is partly addressed in the diamond analogy in the very =\r\nfirst \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; message of this yahoogroup ( \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/gr=\r\noup/vedic-wisdom/message/1 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisd=\r\nom/message/1&gt; ).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Best regards, Narasimha \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; ---------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------    Free \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Jyotish Software, Free=\r\n Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings, &quot;Do It \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Yourself&quot; ritual manuals =\r\nfor short Homam and Pitri Tarpana: \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Films that make a difference: http://=\r\nSaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&gt;       Spirituality: \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/vedic-wisdom&gt;    Jyotish writings: \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/JyotishWritings \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWriti=\r\nngs&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Twitter ID: @homam108 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------=\r\n------------------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; On Sat, Sep 24, 2011 at 3:34 AM, Rama V wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;     Namaste.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I beg to disagree and will leave it at that.

With your constant \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sat-Sangatya, I was able to keep the motivati=\r\non for good things \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and have just completed reciting Durga SaptaSat=\r\nhi 107 times. I am \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; completing the last time on the Chaturdasi befo=\r\nre the Navaratris \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; begin. During Navaratris I plan to perform Chand=\r\ni Homam with 700 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; verses. Currently I am doing Chandi Homam daily w=\r\nith only Durga \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sapta Sloki because I am doing chanting otherwise. =\r\nSapta Sati, \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tough as it seemed in the beginning, became a lot more=\r\n easier for \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; me to chant now (that was the objective with which I h=\r\nave taken up \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this 108 times pArAyaNam) and some day I plan to memo=\r\nrize all \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that. On this occasion, I have a question for Shri Narasi=\r\nmha Garu. \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have come across a writing somewhere on Sapta Sati as =\r\nto how it \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can be a mantra Sastra. The second verse &quot;SavarniH Soory=\r\na TanayOH \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .....&quot; was interpreted to as &quot;Hreem..&quot; beejakshara mantr=\r\na. Do we \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have a book that explains all of the SaptaSati in several=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; contexts, the literal meaning, esoteric meaning, the several \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mantras that the verses represent etc.? If there is no book like \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; that, I would request Shri PVR to author such a book because of \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; his deep insights into the subject/language and the advanced \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sad=\r\nhaka that he is!
