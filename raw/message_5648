I am not an \n&gt; &gt; &gt;emotional \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;person, but this made my eyes wet.

This kind of pure thinking \n&gt; &gt;is \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;so \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;difficult to find now-a-days...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Once when I was in =\r\nAlandi, I heard two blind beggars talk inside the \n&gt; &gt;temple \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;presmises. One of them said that he has recently been initiated by someo=\r\nne \n&gt; &gt; &gt;into \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the Varkari path and he can now sing Abhags (sp=\r\niritual songs in Marathi) in \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;company of other in=\r\nitiates. He was very happy. The other beggar asked him, \n&gt; &gt;why \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;don&#39;t you sing the abhangs when you beg. You will get more money, yo=\r\nur \n&gt; &gt;singing \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is terrific. The first man replied that he=\r\n cannot use songs of God for \n&gt; &gt;earning \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;money, even if t=\r\nhe money is coming through begging. God is beyond everything \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;el=\r\nse. Begging is for my dharma, but signing is for God. I will not mix the \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;two.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;When I heard it (&lt;deleted&gt; was also there) I was=\r\n stunned. This coming from \n&gt; &gt;a \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;begger! This created a s=\r\ntrong impact on my mind.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Such is the power of Gyaneshwar =\r\nMaharaj who moulds the consciousness of \n&gt; &gt;all \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;who go the=\r\nre.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, Krishna temple at Alandi, where Gyaneshwar Mahar=\r\naj is believed to be \n&gt; &gt; &gt;still \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;meditating in the undergroun=\r\nd chamber (I have no doubt about it), is one of \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\nmost spiritually charged places I have been to.
