These five elements are ruled by Ganapa=\r\nthi, \n&gt; &gt; Brahma, Lakshmi & Vishnu, Rudra and Gouri. So we pray to them as =\r\nthey \n&gt; &gt; control our astitva or identity.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Literal meaning of =E2=\r\n=80=9Cgraha=E2=80=9D is one that grabs. We experience things as \n&gt; &gt; grahas=\r\n or planets grab our consciousness and make it experience the \n&gt; &gt; results =\r\n(reactions) of various actions performed by us in the past. \n&gt; &gt; Grahas are=\r\n the agents of karma phala (fruits of previous actions). Thus, \n&gt; &gt; grahas =\r\ncontrol our bhoktritva or experiencership. So we pray to them, \n&gt; &gt; with ru=\r\nling and co-ruling deities.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ten dikpalakas rule the ten directions=\r\n (eight 2-dimensional directions, \n&gt; &gt; up and down). They not only rule the=\r\n physical directions, but the \n&gt; &gt; direction one takes in life with one&#39;s w=\r\nork. For example, in Vedic \n&gt; &gt; astrology, a chart called dasamsa shows one=\r\n&#39;s work in society and the \n&gt; &gt; ten parts of that chart are ruled by dikpal=\r\nakas showing different kinds \n&gt; &gt; of work. Indra, for example, shows work t=\r\nhat asserts authority and \n&gt; &gt; control over others (e.g. political leaders,=\r\n managers). Agni, for \n&gt; &gt; example, shows work that transforms things (e.g.=\r\n engineers, designers). \n&gt; &gt; Yama shows work related to enforcing rules (e.=\r\ng. quality assurance, \n&gt; &gt; police). Nirriti shows work that breaks barriers=\r\n (e.g. mafia, cutting \n&gt; &gt; edge innovations). And so on. It is dikpalakas w=\r\nho control our kartritva \n&gt; &gt; or doership and make us perform different typ=\r\nes of actions. So we pray \n&gt; &gt; to them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
