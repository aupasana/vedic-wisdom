Where should y=\r\nou go to seek for God -- are not all the poor, the miserable, the weak, God=\r\ns? Why not worship them first? Believe in the omnipotent power of love. Hav=\r\ne you love?-- you are omnipotent.&quot;\n\n&quot;Look upon every man, woman, and every =\r\none as God. You cannot help anyone, you can only serve: serve the children =\r\nof the Lord, serve the Lord Himself, if you have the privilege. If the Lord=\r\n grants that you can help any one of his children, blessed you are; do not =\r\nthink too much of yourselves. Blessed you are that that privilege was given=\r\n to you when others had it not. Do it only as a worship. I should see God i=\r\nn the poor, and it is for my salvation that I go and worship them. The poor=\r\n and the miserable are for our salvation, so that we may serve the Lord, co=\r\nming in the shape of the diseased, coming in the shape of the lunatic, the =\r\nleper, and the sinner!&quot;\n\nVivekananda&#39;s ideal is a great one, but I find, no=\r\n easy task. Japa is pleasant. But karma yoga, serving people of all sorts..=\r\n..sometimes ungrateful, angry, even dangerous people...with love is one hec=\r\nk of a challenge. \n\nHere is just one remarkable example of wonderful karma =\r\nyoga. I&#39;m sure there are many other people who do this, without labelling t=\r\nhemselves spiritual. This chap risks his life daily in a war-torn zone for =\r\nthe sake of others. Wish I had half his courage. \n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/new=\r\ns/magazine-17314391 \n\nI guess the acid test of spiritual progress is how mu=\r\nch we do for others. If I do japa all day, while the man next to me is sick=\r\n and starving, I doubt God would be impressed. Japa cleans the mind. The fr=\r\nuit of japa surely has to be a burning desire to serve humanity. And there =\r\nis no dearth of suffering on this planet, and no lack of opportunity to ser=\r\nve. \n\nDon&#39;t think it matters whether or not we see fancy visions in meditat=\r\nion, or hear &#39;anahata sounds&#39; or anything else. All that stuff is great I g=\r\nuess, but if it&#39;s not accompanied by a burning desire to relieve the miseri=\r\nes of our fellow men/women, it probably ain&#39;t worth anything much. \n\nWe all=\r\n talk about meditation and japa....karma yoga is not so fun, but just as vi=\r\ntal. \n\nWell, at least, Vivekananda seems to think so anyway! I&#39;ve got a lon=\r\ng way to go before I reach his ideal of a karma yogi....hope you guys are d=\r\noing better than me! \n\nGood luck with your karma yoga eveyone. :) \n\nAparna =\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
