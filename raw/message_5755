When it comes to spiritual sadhana, no effort is wasted. \nEverything eventually adds up.\n\n*        *        *\n\nOne who thinks, &quot;I have done so much sadhana. Did I get anything back&quot;, \nis trying to do business with god. One cannot conquer god or do business \nwith god. One can only surrender to god.\n\nIn this age, there are very few who think of god, even with a selfish \nattitude. Then, what to say of those who think of god with selfless \ndevotion and surrender? God is also looking for such devotees. How can \ngod hide from such a devotee? Anyone who calls on god will eventually be \nanswered. More so for those who call on god with surrender.\n\n*        *        *\n\nBut remember one thing. For us, 10 years or 100 years (or even 1000 \nyears) may be a long time. But, for god, it is a very very very short \nspan of time.\n\nA hungry child crying for mother may be disappointed if mother does not \nrush to one in a second or a minute to feed one. But mother knows that \nshe need not come immediately and no hell will break loose if she takes \n10 minutes to come. Child may be disapppointed by the delay, but mother \nknows the best. Eventually, mother will come to the child and feed the \nchild before it is too late.\n\nSame with god. Do sadhana. Keep calling on god. God will come to one at \nthe right time, in the right form.\n\n*        *        *\n\nThough fear of god is ok in the beginning, try to convert that fear into \nlove and surrender.\n\nPray to god, not for the fear of hell (either celestially or on earth!) \nnor for the lure of heaven (either celestially or on earth!), but \nbecause god is the concentrated essence of purity in the universe (and \nhence within each person, who is a microcosm of the universe). Love god, \nadore god and surrender to god. Eventually, that will purify you and \nfill you with divinity.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;chaudhuri.krishnendu&quot; \n&lt;krishnenduchdhr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Continue to pray without losing heart.
