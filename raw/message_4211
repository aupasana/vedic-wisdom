At the tim=\r\ne of the prophet, there were two super powers in the world: the Romans and =\r\nthe Persians with the Ethiopians a distant 3rd. Even they never conquered A=\r\nrabia and the others thought there was nothing there to conquer - not worth=\r\n the effort. If Hindustan was to reach Arabia, it would have had to cross t=\r\nhe Persian empire, something the Persian empire wouldn&#39;t have allowed, and =\r\nthey would have fight their way across and there&#39;s no reports of war betwee=\r\nn the two: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sassanid_Empire\n\nA simple check wou=\r\nld be to look at the Arabic language. Any people that have been conquered, =\r\ntaken on / adopt at least some words of the conquering language, just look =\r\nat Hindi or english. Arabic is unique in that it is unlike any other - it i=\r\ns not a &#39;pidgin&#39; language where words have been adopted from other cultures=\r\n.\n\nTo find scripture refering to a King Vikramaditya, does not &#39;prove beyon=\r\nd doubt&#39; that that land belonged to his empire - it could simply be saying =\r\nthat there was a king once named Vikramaditya.\n\nEven if the Kabaa was a Hin=\r\ndu temple, it has been rebuilt many times (though always on the same locati=\r\non and for the same purpose) - both before and after the prophet, so to ref=\r\ner to it as a Hindu temple is inaccurate.\n\nHowver does it really matter if =\r\nKaaba was a Hindu Temple or not?\nWhy don&#39;t we establish a realtionship betw=\r\neen Hindu and Muslim within a view to prosper India altogether rather than =\r\ngetting into such topic which could raise conflict between two brothers of =\r\nsame family.\n\nBest Wishes\nVarun Sharma\n\n\nTHIS WILL CHANGE AS WELL!\n\nVarun S=\r\nharma\n\n\n\nDon&#39;t cry=C2=A0because it&#39;s over, Smile coz=C2=A0it happened. \n\n--=\r\n- On Wed, 21/4/10, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: r=\r\najarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kaaba a =\r\nHindu Temple?\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Wednesday, 21 April, 2=\r\n010, 6:02 PM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNamaste Jitendra ji,\n=C2=A0\nThis=C2=A0articl=\r\ne have been floating in the internet for quite some time, it&#39;s authenticity=\r\n is questionable.

Oak (Historian) \nGlancing throu=\r\ngh some research material recently, I was pleasantly surprised to come acro=\r\nss a reference to a king Vikramaditya inscription found in the Kaaba in Mec=\r\nca proving beyond doubt that the Arabian Peninsula formed a part of his Ind=\r\nian Empire. \nThe text of the crucial Vikramaditya inscription, found inscri=\r\nbed on a gold dish hung inside the Kaaba shrine in Mecca, is found recorded=\r\n on page 315 of a volume known as =E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=80=99 treasured=\r\n in the Makhtab-e-Sultania library in Istanbul, Turkey. Rendered in free En=\r\nglish the inscription says: \n&quot;Fortunate are those who were born (and lived)=\r\n during king Vikram=E2=80=99s reign. He was a noble, generous dutiful ruler=\r\n, devoted to the welfare of his subjects. But at that time we Arabs, oblivi=\r\nous of God, were lost in sensual pleasures. Plotting and torture were rampa=\r\nnt. The darkness of ignorance had enveloped our country. Like the lamb stru=\r\nggling for her life in the cruel paws of a wolf we Arabs were caught up in =\r\nignorance. The entire country was enveloped in a darkness so intense as on =\r\na new moon night. But the present dawn and pleasant sunshine of education i=\r\ns the result of the favour of the noble king Vikramaditya whose benevolent =\r\nsupervision did not lose sight of us- foreigners as we were. He spread his =\r\nsacred religion amongst us and sent scholars whose brilliance shone like th=\r\nat of the sun from his country to ours. These scholars and preceptors throu=\r\ngh whose benevolence we were once again made cognisant of the presence of G=\r\nod, introduced to His sacred\n existence and put on the road of Truth, had c=\r\nome to our country to preach their religion and impart education at king Vi=\r\nkramaditya=E2=80=99s behest.&quot; \nFor those who would like to read the Arabic =\r\nwording I reproduce it hereunder in Roman script: \n&quot;Itrashaphai Santu Ibikr=\r\namatul Phahalameen Karimun Yartapheeha Wayosassaru Bihillahaya Samaini Ela =\r\nMotakabberen Sihillaha Yuhee Quid min howa Yapakhara phajjal asari nahone o=\r\nsirom bayjayhalem.

As hmiman burukankad toluho watastaru hihila Yakajibaymana b=\r\nalay kulk amarena phaneya jaunabilamary Bikramatum&quot;. \n(Page 315 Sayar-ul-ok=\r\nul) . \n[Note: The title =E2=80=98Saya-ul-okul=E2=80=99 signifies memorable =\r\nwords.] \nA careful analysis of the above inscription enables us to draw the=\r\n following conclusions: \n1.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 That the ancient =\r\nIndian empires may have extended up to the eastern boundaries of Arabia unt=\r\nil Vikramaditya and that it was he who for the first time conquered Arabia.=\r\n Because the inscription says that king Vikram who dispelled the darkness o=\r\nf ignorance from Arabia. \n2.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 That, whatever t=\r\nheir earlier faith, King Vikrama=E2=80=99s preachers had succeeded in sprea=\r\nding the Vedic (based on the Vedas, the Hindu sacred scriptures)) way of li=\r\nfe in Arabia. \n3.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 That the knowledge of India=\r\nn arts and sciences was imparted by Indians to the Arabs directly by foundi=\r\nng schools, academies and cultural centres. The belief, therefore, that vis=\r\niting Arabs conveyed that knowledge to their own lands through their own in=\r\ndefatigable efforts and scholarship is unfounded. \nAn ancillary conclusion =\r\ncould be that the so-called Kutub Minar (in Delhi, India) could well be kin=\r\ng Vikramadiya=E2=80=99s tower commemorating his conquest of Arabia. This co=\r\nnclusion is strengthened by two pointers. Firstly, the inscription on the i=\r\nron pillar near the so-called Kutub Minar refers to the marriage of the vic=\r\ntorious king Vikramaditya to the princess of Balhika. This Balhika is none =\r\nother than the Balkh region in West Asia. It could be that Arabia was wrest=\r\nled by king Vikramaditya from the ruler of Balkh who concluded a treaty by =\r\ngiving his daughter in marriage to the victor. Secondly, the township adjoi=\r\nning the so called Kutub Minar is named Mehrauli after Mihira who was the r=\r\nenowned astronomer-mathemat ician of king Vikram=E2=80=99s court. Mehrauli =\r\nis the corrupt form of Sanskrit =E2=80=98Mihira-Awali=E2=80=99 signifying a=\r\n row of houses raised for Mihira and his helpers and assistants working on =\r\nastronomical observations made from the tower. \nHaving seen the far reachin=\r\ng and history shaking implications of the Arabic inscription concerning kin=\r\ng Vikrama, we shall now piece together the story of its find. How it came t=\r\no be recorded and hung in the Kaaba in Mecca. What are the other proofs rei=\r\nnforcing the belief that Arabs were once followers of the Indian Vedic way =\r\nof life and that tranquillity and education were ushered into Arabia by kin=\r\ng Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s scholars, educationists from an uneasy period of &quot;=\r\nignorance and turmoil&quot; mentioned in the inscription. \nIn Istanbul, Turkey, =\r\nthere is a famous library called Makhatab-e-Sultania , which is reputed to =\r\nhave the largest collection of ancient West Asian literature. In the Arabic=\r\n section of that library is an anthology of ancient Arabic poetry. That ant=\r\nhology was compiled from an earlier work in A.D. 1742 under the orders of t=\r\nhe Turkish ruler Sultan Salim. \nThe pages of that volume are of Hareer =E2=\r\n=80=93 a kind of silk used for writing on. Each page has a decorative gilde=\r\nd border. That anthology is known as Sayar-ul-Okul. It is divided into thre=\r\ne parts. The first part contains biographic details and the poetic composit=\r\nions of pre-Islamic Arabian poets. The second part embodies accounts and ve=\r\nrses of poets of the period beginning just after prophet Mohammad=E2=80=99s=\r\n times, up to the end of the Banee-Um-Mayya dynasty. The third part deals w=\r\nith later poets up to the end of Khalif Harun-al-Rashid=E2=80=99s times. \nA=\r\nbu Amir Asamai, an Arabian bard who was the poet Laureate of Harun-al-Rashi=\r\nd=E2=80=99s court, has compiled and edited the anthology. \nThe first modern=\r\n edition of =E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=80=99 was printed and published in Be=\r\nrlin in 1864. A subsequent edition is the one published in Beirut in 1932. =\r\n\nThe collection is regarded as the most important and authoritative antholo=\r\ngy of ancient Arabic poetry. It throws considerable light on the social lif=\r\ne, customs, manners and entertainment modes of ancient Arabia. The book als=\r\no contains an elaborate description of the ancient shrine of Mecca, the tow=\r\nn and the annual fair known as OKAJ which used to be held every year around=\r\n the Kaaba temple in Mecca. This should convince readers that the annual ha=\r\nj of the Muslims to the Kaaba is of earlier pre-Islamic congregation. \nBut =\r\nthe OKAJ fair was far from a carnival. It provided a forum for the elite an=\r\nd the learned to discuss the social, religious, political, literary and oth=\r\ner aspects of the Vedic culture then pervading Arabia. =E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Ok=\r\nul=E2=80=99 asserts that the conclusion reached at those discussions were w=\r\nidely respected throughout Arabia. Mecca, therefore, followed the Varanasi =\r\ntradition (of India) of providing a venue for important discussions among t=\r\nhe learned while the masses congregated there for spiritual bliss. The prin=\r\ncipal shrines at both Varanasi in India and at Mecca in Arvasthan (Arabia) =\r\nwere Siva temples. Even to this day ancient Mahadev (Siva) emblems can be s=\r\neen. It is the Shankara (Siva) stone that Muslim pilgrims reverently touch =\r\nand kiss in the Kaaba. \nArabic tradition has lost trace of the founding of =\r\nthe Kaaba temple. The discovery of the Vikramaditya inscription affords a c=\r\nlue. King Vikramaditya is known for his great devotion to Lord Mahadev (Siv=\r\na). At Ujjain (India), the capital of Vikramaditya, exists the famous shrin=\r\ne of Mahankal, i.e., of Lord Shankara (Siva) associated with Vikramaditya. =\r\nSince according to the Vikramaditya inscription he spread the Vedic religio=\r\nn, who else but he could have founded the Kaaba temple in Mecca? \nA few mil=\r\nes away from Mecca is a big signboard which bars the entry of any non-Musli=\r\nm into the area. This is a reminder of the days when the Kaaba was stormed =\r\nand captured solely for the newly established faith of Islam. The object in=\r\n barring entry of non-Muslims was obviously to prevent its recapture. \nAs t=\r\nhe pilgrim proceeds towards Mecca he is asked to shave his head and beard a=\r\nnd to don special sacred attire that consists of two seamless sheets of whi=\r\nte cloth. One is to be worn round the waist and the other over the shoulder=\r\ns. Both these rites are remnants of the old Vedic practice of entering Hind=\r\nu temples clean- and with holy seamless white sheets. \nThe main shrine in M=\r\necca, which houses the Siva emblem, is known as the Kaaba. It is clothed in=\r\n a black shroud. That custom also originates from the days when it was thou=\r\nght necessary to discourage its recapture by camouflaging it. \nAccording to=\r\n the Encyclopaedia Britannica, the Kaaba has 360 images. Traditional accoun=\r\nts mention that one of the deities among the 360 destroyed when the place w=\r\nas stormed, was that of Saturn; another was of the Moon and yet another was=\r\n one called Allah. That shows that in the Kaaba the Arabs worshipped the ni=\r\nne planets in pre-Islamic days. In India the practice of =E2=80=98Navagraha=\r\n=E2=80=99 puja, that is worship of the nine planets, is still in vogue. Two=\r\n of these nine are Saturn and Moon. \nIn India the crescent moon is always p=\r\nainted across the forehead of the Siva symbol. Since that symbol was associ=\r\nated with the Siva emblem in Kaaba it came to be grafted on the flag of Isl=\r\nam. \nAnother Hindu tradition associated with the Kaaba is that of the sacre=\r\nd stream Ganga (sacred waters of the Ganges river). According to the Hindu =\r\ntradition Ganga is also inseparable from the Shiva emblem as the crescent m=\r\noon. Wherever there is a Siva emblem, Ganga must co-exist. True to that ass=\r\nociation a sacred fount exists near the Kaaba. Its water is held sacred bec=\r\nause it has been traditionally regarded as Ganga since pre-Islamic times (Z=\r\nam-Zam water). \n[Note: Even today, Muslim pilgrims who go to the Kaaba for =\r\nHaj regard this Zam-Zam water with reverence and take some bottled water wi=\r\nth them as sacred water.] \nMuslim pilgrims visiting the Kaaba temple go aro=\r\nund it seven times. In no other mosque does the circumambulation prevail. H=\r\nindus invariably circumambulate around their deities. This is yet another p=\r\nroof that the Kaaba shrine is a pre-Islamic Indian Shiva temple where the H=\r\nindu practice of circumambulation is still meticulously observed. \nThe prac=\r\ntice of taking seven steps- known as Saptapadi in Sanskrit- is associated w=\r\nith Hindu marriage ceremony and fire worship. The culminating rite in a Hin=\r\ndu marriage enjoins upon the bride and groom to go round the sacred fire fo=\r\nur times (but misunderstood by many as seven times). Since &quot;Makha&quot; means fi=\r\nre, the seven circumambulations also prove that Mecca was the seat of India=\r\nn fire-worship in the West Asia. \nIt might come as a stunning revelation to=\r\n many that the word =E2=80=98ALLAH=E2=80=99 itself is Sanskrit. In Sanskrit=\r\n language Allah, Akka and Amba are synonyms. They signify a goddess or moth=\r\ner. The term =E2=80=98ALLAH=E2=80=99 forms part of Sanskrit chants invoking=\r\n goddess Durga, also known as Bhavani, Chandi and Mahishasurmardini. The Is=\r\nlamic word for God is., therefore, not an innovation but the ancient Sanskr=\r\nit appellation retained and continued by Islam. Allah means mother or godde=\r\nss and mother goddess. \nOne Koranic verse is an exact translation of a stan=\r\nza in the Yajurveda. This was pointed out by the great research scholar Pan=\r\ndit Satavlekar of Pardi in one of his articles. \n[Note: Another scholar poi=\r\nnts out that the following teaching from the Koran is exactly similar to th=\r\ne teaching of the Kena Upanishad (1.7). \nThe Koran: \n&quot;Sight perceives Him n=\r\not. But He perceives men&#39;s sights; for He is the knower of secrets, the Awa=\r\nre.&quot; \nKena Upanishad: \n&quot;That which cannot be seen by the eye but through wh=\r\nich the eye itself sees, know That to be Brahman (God) and not what people =\r\nworship here (in the manifested world).&quot; \nA simplified meaning of both the =\r\nabove verses reads: \nGod is one and that He is beyond man&#39;s sensory experie=\r\nnce. \nThe identity of Unani and Ayurvedic systems shows that Unani is just =\r\nthe Arabic term for the Ayurvedic system of healing taught to them and admi=\r\nnistered in Arabia when Arabia formed part of the Indian empire. \nIt will n=\r\now be easy to comprehend the various Hindu customs still prevailing in West=\r\n Asian countries even after the existence of Islam during the last 1300 yea=\r\nrs. Let us review some Hindu traditions which exist as the core of Islamic =\r\npractice. \nThe Hindus have a pantheon of 33 gods. People in Asia Minor too =\r\nworshipped 33 gods before the spread of Islam. The lunar calendar was intro=\r\nduced in West Asia during the Indian rule. The Muslim month =E2=80=98Safar=\r\n=E2=80=99 signifying the =E2=80=98extra=E2=80=99 month (Adhik Maas) in the =\r\nHindu calendar. The Muslim month Rabi is the corrupt form of Ravi meaning t=\r\nhe sun because Sanskrit =E2=80=98V=E2=80=99 changes into Prakrit =E2=80=98B=\r\n=E2=80=99 (Prakrit being the popular version of Sanskrit language). The Mus=\r\nlim sanctity for Gyrahwi Sharif is nothing but the Hindu Ekadashi (Gyrah =\r\n=3D elevan or Gyaarah). Both are identical in meaning. \nThe Islamic practic=\r\ne of Bakari Eed derives from the Go-Medh and Ashva-Medh Yagnas or sacrifice=\r\ns of Vedic times. Eed in Sanskrit means worship. The Islamic word Eed for f=\r\nestive days, signifying days of worship, is therefore a pure Sanskrit word.=\r\n The word MESH in the Hindu zodiac signifies a lamb. Since in ancient times=\r\n the year used to begin with the entry of the sun in Aries, the occasion wa=\r\ns celebrated with mutton feasting. That is the origin of the Bakari Eed fes=\r\ntival. \n[Note: The word Bakari is an Indian language word for a goat.] \nSin=\r\nce Eed means worship and Griha means =E2=80=98house=E2=80=99, the Islamic w=\r\nord Idgah signifies a =E2=80=98House of worship=E2=80=99 which is the exact=\r\n Sanskrit connotation of the term. Similarly the word =E2=80=98Namaz=E2=80=\r\n=99 derives from two Sanskrit roots =E2=80=98Nama=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98Yaj=\r\nna=E2=80=99 (NAMa yAJna) meaning bowing and worshipping. \nVedic description=\r\ns about the moon, the different stellar constellations and the creation of =\r\nthe universe have been incorporated from the Vedas in Koran part 1 chapter =\r\n2, stanza 113, 114, 115, and 158, 189, chapter 9, stanza 37 and chapter 10,=\r\n stanzas 4 to 7. \nRecital of the Namaz five times a day owes its origin to =\r\nthe Vedic injunction of Panchmahayagna (five daily worship- Panch-Maha-Yagn=\r\na) which is part of the daily Vedic ritual prescribed for all individuals. =\r\n\nMuslims are enjoined cleanliness of five parts of the body before commenci=\r\nng prayers. This derives from the Vedic injuction =E2=80=98Shareer Shydhyar=\r\ntham Panchanga Nyasah=E2=80=99. \nFour months of the year are regarded as ve=\r\nry sacred in Islamic custom. The devout are enjoined to abstain from plunde=\r\nr and other evil deeds during that period. This originates in the Chaturmas=\r\na i.e., the four-month period of special vows and austerities in Hindu trad=\r\nition. Shabibarat is the corrupt form of Shiva Vrat and Shiva Ratra. Since =\r\nthe Kaaba has been an important centre of Shiva (Siva) worship from times i=\r\nmmemorial, the Shivaratri festival used to be celebrated there with great g=\r\nusto. It is that festival which is signified by the Islamic word Shabibarat=\r\n. \nEncyclopaedias tell us that there are inscriptions on the side of the Ka=\r\naba walls. What they are, no body has been allowed to study, according to t=\r\nhe correspondence I had with an American scholar of Arabic. But according t=\r\no hearsay at least some of those inscriptions are in Sanskrit, and some of =\r\nthem are stanzas from the Bhagavad Gita. \nAccording to extant Islamic recor=\r\nds, Indian merchants had settled in Arabia, particularly in Yemen, and thei=\r\nr life and manners deeply influenced those who came in touch with them. At =\r\nUbla there was a large number of Indian settlements. This shows that Indian=\r\ns were in Arabia and Yemen in sufficient strength and commanding position t=\r\no be able to influence the local people. This could not be possible unless =\r\nthey belonged to the ruling class. \nIt is mentioned in the Abadis i.e., the=\r\n authentic traditions of Prophet Mohammad compiled by Imam Bukhari that the=\r\n Indian tribe of Jats had settled in Arabia before Prophet Mohammad=E2=80=\r\n=99s times. Once when Hazrat Ayesha, wife of the Prophet, was taken ill, he=\r\nr nephew sent for a Jat physician for her treatment. This proves that India=\r\nns enjoyed a high and esteemed status in Arabia. Such a status could not be=\r\n theirs unless they were the rulers. Bukhari also tells us that an Indian R=\r\naja (king) sent a jar of ginger pickles to the Prophet. This shows that the=\r\n Indian Jat Raja ruled an adjacent area so as to be in a position to send s=\r\nuch an insignificant present as ginger pickles. The Prophet is said to have=\r\n so highly relished it as to have told his colleagues also to partake of it=\r\n. These references show that even during Prophet Mohammad=E2=80=99s times I=\r\nndians retained their influential role in Arabia, which was a dwindling leg=\r\nacy from Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s times. \nThe Islamic term =E2=80=98Eed-ul-Fi=\r\ntr=E2=80=99 derives from the =E2=80=98Eed of Piters=E2=80=99 that is worshi=\r\np of forefathers in Sanskrit tradition. In India, Hindus commemorate their =\r\nancestors during the Pitr-Paksha that is the fortnight reserved for their r=\r\nemembrance. The very same is the significance of =E2=80=98Eed-ul-Fitr=E2=80=\r\n=99 (worship of forefathers) . \nThe Islamic practice of observing the moon =\r\nrise before deciding on celebrating the occasion derives from the Hindu cus=\r\ntom of breaking fast on Sankranti and Vinayaki Chaturthi only after sightin=\r\ng the moon. \nBarah Vafat, the Muslim festival for commemorating those dead =\r\nin battle or by weapons, derives from a similar Sanskrit tradition because =\r\nin Sanskrit =E2=80=98Phiphaut=E2=80=99 is =E2=80=98death=E2=80=99. Hindus o=\r\nbserve Chayal Chaturdashi in memory of those who have died in battle. \nThe =\r\nword Arabia is itself the abbreviation of a Sanskrit word. The original wor=\r\nd is =E2=80=98Arabasthan=E2=80=99. Since Prakrit =E2=80=98B=E2=80=99 is San=\r\nskrit =E2=80=98V=E2=80=99 the original Sanskrit name of the land is =E2=80=\r\n=98Arvasthan=E2=80=99. =E2=80=98Arva=E2=80=99 in Sanskrit means a horse. Ar=\r\nvasthan signifies a land of horses., and as well all know, Arabia is famous=\r\n for its horses. \nThis discovery changes the entire complexion of the histo=\r\nry of ancient India. Firstly we may have to revise our concepts about the k=\r\ning who had the largest empire in history. It could be that the expanse of =\r\nking Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s empire was greater than that of all others. Sec=\r\nondly, the idea that the Indian empire spread only to the east and not in t=\r\nhe west beyond say, Afghanisthan may have to be abandoned. Thirdly the effe=\r\nminate and pathetic belief that India, unlike any other country in the worl=\r\nd could by some age spread her benign and beatific cultural influence, lang=\r\nuage, customs, manners and education over distant lands without militarily =\r\nconquering them is baseless. India did conquer all those countries physical=\r\nly wherever traces of its culture and language are still extant and the reg=\r\nion extended from Bali island in the south Pacific to the Baltic in Norther=\r\nn Europe and from Korea to Kaaba. The only difference was that while Indian=\r\n rulers\n identified themselves with the local population and established we=\r\nlfare states, Moghuls and others who ruled conquered lands perpetuated unto=\r\nld atrocities over the vanquished. \n=E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=80=99 tells u=\r\ns that a pan-Arabic poetic symposium used to be held in Mecca at the annual=\r\n Okaj fair in pre-Islamic times. All leading poets used to participate in i=\r\nt. \nPoems considered best were awarded prizes. The best-engraved on gold pl=\r\nate were hung inside the temple. Others etched on camel or goatskin were hu=\r\nng outside. Thus for thousands of years the Kaaba was the treasure house of=\r\n the best Arabian poetic thought inspired by the Indian Vedic tradition. \nT=\r\nhat tradition being of immemorial antiquity many poetic compositions were e=\r\nngraved and hung inside and outside on the walls of the Kaaba. But most of =\r\nthe poems got lost and destroyed during the storming of the Kaaba by Prophe=\r\nt Mohammad=E2=80=99s troops. The Prophet=E2=80=99s court poet, Hassan-bin-S=\r\nawik, who was among the invaders, captured some of the treasured poems and =\r\ndumped the gold plate on which they were inscribed in his own home. Sawik=\r\n=E2=80=99s grandson, hoping to earn a reward carried those gold plates to K=\r\nhalif=E2=80=99s court where he met the well-known Arab scholar Abu Amir Asa=\r\nmai. The latter received from the bearer five gold plates and 16 leather sh=\r\neets with the prize-winning poems engraved on them. The bearer was sent awa=\r\ny happy bestowed with a good reward. \nOn the five gold plates were inscribe=\r\nd verses by ancient Arab poets like Labi Baynay, Akhatab-bin- Turfa and Jar=\r\nrham Bintoi. That discovery made Harun-al-Rashid order Abu Amir to compile =\r\na collection of all earlier compositions. One of the compositions in the co=\r\nllection is a tribute in verse paid by Jarrham Bintoi, a renowned Arab poet=\r\n, to king Vikramaditya. Bintoi who lived 165 years before Prophet Mohammad =\r\nhad received the highest award for the best poetic compositions for three y=\r\nears in succession in the pan-Arabic symposiums held in Mecca every year. A=\r\nll those three poems of Bintoi adjudged best were hung inside the Kaaba tem=\r\nple, inscribed on gold plates. One of these constituted an unreserved tribu=\r\nte to King Vikramaditya for his paternal and filial rule over Arabia. That =\r\nhas already been quoted above. \nPre-Islamic Arabian poet Bintoi=E2=80=99s t=\r\nribute to king Vikramaditya is a decisive evidence that it was king Vikrama=\r\nditya who first conquered the Arabian Peninsula and made it a part of the I=\r\nndian Empire. This explains why starting from India towards the west we hav=\r\ne all Sanskrit names like Afghanisthan (now Afghanistan) , Baluchisthan, Ku=\r\nrdisthan, Tajikiathan, Uzbekisthan,=C2=A0 Iran, Sivisthan, Iraq, Arvasthan,=\r\n Turkesthan (Turkmenisthan) etc. \nHistorians have blundered in not giving d=\r\nue weight to the evidence provided by Sanskrit names pervading over the ent=\r\nire west Asian region. Let us take a contemporary instance. Why did a part =\r\nof India get named Nagaland even after the end of British rule over India? =\r\nAfter all historical traces are wiped out of human memory, will a future ag=\r\ne historian be wrong if he concludes from the name Nagaland that the Britis=\r\nh or some English speaking power must have ruled over India? Why is Portugu=\r\nese spoken in Goa (part of India), and French in Pondichery (part of India)=\r\n, and both French and English in Canada? Is it not because those people rul=\r\ned over the territories where their languages are spoken? Can we not then j=\r\nustly conclude that wherever traces of Sanskrit names and traditions exist =\r\nIndians once held sway? It is unfortunate that this important piece of deci=\r\nsive evidence has been ignored all these centuries. \nAnother question which=\r\n should have presented itself to historians for consideration is how could =\r\nit be that Indian empires could extend in the east as far as Korea and Japa=\r\nn, while not being able to make headway beyond Afghanisthan? In fact land c=\r\nampaigns are much easier to conduct than by sea. It was the Indians who rul=\r\ned the entire West Asian region from Karachi to Hedjaz and who gave Sanskri=\r\nt names to those lands and the towns therein, introduce their pantheon of t=\r\nhe fire-worship, imparted education and established law and order. \nIt may =\r\nbe that Arabia itself was not part of the Indian empire until king Vikrama =\r\n, since Bintoi says that it was king Vikrama who for the first time brought=\r\n about a radical change in the social, cultural and political life of Arabi=\r\na. It may be that the whole of West Asia except Arabia was under Indian rul=\r\ne before Vikrama. The latter added Arabia too to the Indian Empire. Or as a=\r\n remote possibility it could be that king Vikramaditya himself conducted a =\r\nseries of brilliant campaigns annexing to his empire the vast region betwee=\r\nn Afghanisthan and Hedjaz. \nIncidentally this also explains why king Vikram=\r\naditya is so famous in history. Apart from the nobility and truthfulness of=\r\n heart and his impartial filial affection for all his subjects, whether Ind=\r\nian or Arab, as testified by Bintoi, king Vikramaditya has been permanently=\r\n enshrined in the pages of history because he was the world=E2=80=99s great=\r\nest ruler having the largest empire. It should be remembered that only a mo=\r\nnarch with a vast empire gets famous in world history. Vikram Samvat (calen=\r\ndar still widely in use in India today) which he initiated over 2000 years =\r\nago may well mark his victory over Arabia, and the so called Kutub Minar (K=\r\nutub Tower in Delhi), a pillar commemorating that victory and the consequen=\r\ntial marriage with the Vaihika (Balkh) princess as testified by the nearby =\r\niron pillar inscription. \nA great many puzzles of ancient world history get=\r\n automatically solved by a proper understanding of these great conquests of=\r\n king Vikramaditya. As recorded by the Arab poet Bintoi, Indian scholars, p=\r\nreachers and social workers spread the fire-worship ceremony, preached the =\r\nVedic way of life, manned schools, set up Ayurvedic (healing) centres, trai=\r\nned the local people in irrigation and agriculture and established in those=\r\n regions a democratic, orderly, peaceful, enlightened and religious way of =\r\nlife. That was of course, a Vedic Hindu way of life. \nIt is from such ancie=\r\nnt times that Indian Kshtriya royal families, like the Pahalvis and Barmaks=\r\n, have held sway over Iran and Iraq. It is those conquests, which made the =\r\nParsees Agnihotris i.e., fire-worshippers. It is therefore that we find the=\r\n Kurds of Kurdisthan speaking a Sanskritised dialect, fire temples existing=\r\n thousands of miles away from India, and scores of sites of ancient Indian =\r\ncultural centres like Navbahar in West Asia and the numerous viharas in Sov=\r\niet Russia spread throughout the world. Ever since so many viharas are ofte=\r\nn dug up in Soviet Russia, ancient Indian sculptures are also found in exca=\r\nvations in Central Asia. The same goes for West Asia. \n[Note: Ancient India=\r\nn sculptures include metal statues of the Hindu deity Ganesh (the elephant =\r\nheaded god); the most recent find being in Kuwait]. \nUnfortunately these ch=\r\napters of world history have been almost obliterated from public memory. Th=\r\ney need to be carefully deciphered and rewritten. When these chapters are r=\r\newritten they might change the entire concept and orientation of ancient hi=\r\nstory. \nIn view of the overwhelming evidence led above, historians, scholar=\r\ns, students of history and lay men alike should take note that they had bet=\r\nter revise their text books of ancient world history. The existence of Hind=\r\nu customs, shrines, Sanskrit names of whole regions, countries and towns an=\r\nd the Vikramaditya inscriptions reproduced at the beginning are a thumping =\r\nproof that Indian Kshatriyas once ruled over the vast region from Bali to B=\r\naltic and Korea to Kaaba in Mecca, Arabia at the very least. \n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\r\n--0-161805700-1271877767=:88998\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste to all Brothers &amp; Sisters&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I consulted one of my learned friend on this, please see his r=\r\neply below:&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#ff40ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;It is widely accept=\r\ned and historically proven Arabia had never been conquered before the 6th c=\r\nentury CE. At the time of the prophet, there were two super powers in the w=\r\norld: the Romans and the Persians with the Ethiopians a distant 3rd. Even t=\r\nhey never conquered Arabia and the others thought there was nothing there t=\r\no conquer - not worth the effort. If Hindustan was to reach Arabia, it woul=\r\nd have had to cross the Persian empire, something the Persian empire wouldn=\r\n&#39;t have allowed, and they would have fight their way across and there&#39;s no =\r\nreports of war between the two: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sassanid_Empir=\r\ne&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A simple check would be to look at the Arabic language. Any people=\r\n that have been conquered, taken on / adopt at least some words of the conq=\r\nuering language, just look at Hindi or english. Arabic is unique in that it=\r\n is unlike any other - it is not a &#39;pidgin&#39; language where words have been =\r\nadopted from\n other cultures.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To find scripture refering to a King V=\r\nikramaditya, does not &#39;prove beyond doubt&#39; that that land belonged to his e=\r\nmpire - it could simply be saying that there was a king once named Vikramad=\r\nitya.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Even if the Kabaa was a Hindu temple, it has been rebuilt many=\r\n times (though always on the same location and for the same purpose) - both=\r\n before and after the prophet, so to refer to it as a Hindu temple is inacc=\r\nurate.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Howver does it really matter if Kaaba was a Hindu Tem=\r\nple or not?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Why don&#39;t we establish a realtionship between Hindu =\r\nand Muslim within a view to prosper India altogether rather than getting in=\r\nto such topic which could raise conflict between two brothers of same famil=\r\ny.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best Wishes&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Varun Sharma&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TH=\r\nIS WILL CHANGE AS WELL!&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;IMG src=3D&quot;http://www.globalsecuri=\r\nty.org/military/systems/aircraft/images/f-16-ani.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#00=\r\n00ff size=3D4&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Varun Sharma&lt;IMG src=3D&quot;http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg=\r\n.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/40.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT co=\r\nlor=3D#0060bf&gt;Don&#39;t cry&nbsp;because it&#39;s over, Smile coz&nbsp;it happened.=\r\n &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Wed, 21/4/10, rajarshi nandy &lt;I&gt;&lt;rajarshi14@ya=\r\nhoo.co.in&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 5=\r\npx; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: raja=\r\nrshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Ka=\r\naba a Hindu Temple?&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Wednesday,=\r\n 21 April, 2010, 6:02 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv955447191&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;DISP=\r\nLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;TABLE cellSpacing=3D0=\r\n cellPadding=3D0 border=3D0&gt;\n&lt;TBODY&gt;\n&lt;TR&gt;\n&lt;TD vAlign=3Dtop&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste Ji=\r\ntendra ji,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;This&nbsp;article have been floatin=\r\ng in the internet for quite some time, it&#39;s authenticity is questionable.
