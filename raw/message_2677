I think you did very wel=\r\nl. We all went through the same thing and now you will just grow in confide=\r\nnce. Practice makes us perfect. \n\nDon&#39;t worry about your neighbors. Conside=\r\nr the burns as your trophies :), that is the nature of fire.\n\nI hope you en=\r\njoy your ride and I do (might I add along with the budding homam community)=\r\n certainly wish you the best in your fiery endeavors.\n\nRegards\nNarayan\n\n\n--=\r\n- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;gisundar&quot; &lt;gisundar@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Nam=\r\naskaram Narasimhaji,\n&gt; I would like to share with you and the group my firs=\r\nt Ganapathi homam experience. I planned to do the homam weekly on every sun=\r\nday and finished two weeks so far.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here is how it went.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1st Homam=\r\n :  Was extremely nervous on whether I will be able to sucussfully complete=\r\n my long cherished dream of performing Ganapathi homam. committed lot of mi=\r\nstakes in mantras ,did not say Svahaa at the right places, lighting fire et=\r\nc may be because of my nervousness probably , burnt my finger while putting=\r\n ahuti into the fire (surprisingly unlike most of the other burn wounds , t=\r\nhis did not last for more than 3 hours.. usually a burn would stay for more=\r\n than 2-3 days...and also i realised that i had burnt my finger only when m=\r\ny wife pointed it to me.. i assume this is a good sign  :) ).. I sincerely =\r\nprayed during the Homam conclusion to be forgiven for all the mistakes comm=\r\nited during the homam..\n&gt; \n&gt; 2nd Homam: This time I was very relaxed and to=\r\nok my owm time to make sure that I dont make any mistakes.. the homam fire =\r\nburnt peacefully and I did not hurt myself..I was told by my wife that the =\r\nroom was full of smoke which made breathing difficult and we even had coupl=\r\ne of neighbours at our doorsteps enquiring about the smoke. But again surpr=\r\nisingly I never felt the slightest of discomfort even though I was nearest =\r\nto the homam... \n&gt; \n&gt; So as told by many members in the group , its only pr=\r\nactice that makes one perfect.. I am very happy that I have come across thi=\r\ns group and under ur guidance I am sure eveybody will be benefited in  sadh=\r\nana through homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks and Regards,\n&gt; Girish Sundaram\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
