I am doing it without reve=\r\naling your identity.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; if he didnt go to t=\r\nhe queen for mere enjoyment of sex ,if he didnt indulge himself\n&gt;&gt; mindfull=\r\ny in the deed?&enjoy it,he went only for a reason he is not the karman,atma=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; cannot be polluted,realising this sankara went to the queen&thus he is =\r\nstill as sacred\n&gt;&gt; as ever?\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Though correct, this is a dangerous no=\r\ntion for most people. True, atma cannot be poluted and is beyond desires an=\r\nd actions. But most people do not identify with atma. They\n identify with a=\r\n perishable body. So all the talk of &quot;all is atma and atma is pure&quot; is just=\r\n theory.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Atma is like an ocean in which waves and rippes arise and=\r\n move. Ocean does not get shattered when ripples hit each other and stays t=\r\nhe same. But bodies, minds and other perishable objects arising in atma are=\r\n like waves and ripples arising and moving in ocean. They increase, decreas=\r\ne, get shattered etc. One identifying with the ocean of atma is beyond happ=\r\niness and sadness. One identifying with the ripple of a body will experienc=\r\ne happiness, sadness etc.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Suppose one is watching a movie and know=\r\ns that it is not real and just a movie. Still, when a really scary scene co=\r\nmes, one may be startled. Mere intellectual understanding that it is not re=\r\nal and just a movie, is not enough. It has to be ingrained fully in one&#39;s i=\r\nnstincts. Similarly, intellectually knowing that all this is a play and not=\r\n real, is not enough. When some really\n pleasurable and painful event happe=\r\nns, one WILL identify with the body and experience something.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;If S=\r\nhankara was fully enlightened before that episode (we don&#39;t know that for s=\r\nure), then the action would not have bound him. Otherwise, it would&#39;ve crea=\r\nted a rina. If he experienced some pleasure, he would create a new rina to =\r\nthe queen, to various deities (!) who live within one&#39;s consciousness and o=\r\nperate various parts of one&#39;s body and mind, and to various beings in his v=\r\nirya who may have been significantly affected. He would have to pay those d=\r\nebts back later.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;There is nothing absolut=\r\nely sacred or dirty about any action. It is the intent and attitude of the =\r\nactor that makes an action sacred or dirty. Self-centered actions are more =\r\ndirty than selfless actions geared at others. More so, the denser and more =\r\nselfish one&#39;s\n conditioning. \n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; but know=\r\ning this still he performed his rituals for his mother?did he do\n&gt;&gt; this fo=\r\nr love or respect or pity or just to balance his runa?\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Only still =\r\nocean does not have any ripples or their movement. Similarly only ummanifes=\r\nt atma (Self after dissolution/pralaya and before new srishti/creation) doe=\r\ns not have any objects and actions within it. Atma during a srishti cycle d=\r\noes have many objects within it and many actions between them.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Thu=\r\ns, realizing Self does NOT mean sitting still in a forest and doing nothing=\r\n. Various bodies keep doing various actions. A realized person identifies w=\r\nith atma and actions by various people seem to him/her like his/her actions=\r\n. One does not particularly identify with what one&#39;s old body specifically =\r\ndoes (based on previous momentum).\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Nature uses\n such realized peop=\r\nle to set good examples for the world. So they do engage in some actions. T=\r\nhey have no pride or shame, no happiness or sadness and do whatever spontan=\r\neously occurs to them.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Shankara performing last rites for mother w=\r\nould&#39;ve made Mother happy. Moreover, it would set an example for future. On=\r\ne&#39;s interaction with the world is give & take. We give things to others and=\r\n take things from them. True renunciation is in renouncing what we take. Th=\r\nere is no need to renounce giving. As the prevant notion of sannyasa was to=\r\n cut off from the world, Shankara demonstrated giving others (e.g. mother) =\r\nsannyasa.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Swami Vivekananda and Swami Sivananda took this further.=\r\n They engaged in a lot of service for the society, unlike other sannyasis w=\r\nho lock themselves in isolation.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Of course, if the act of &quot;giving&quot;=\r\n increases pride (i.e. you are &quot;taking&quot; something in return of what you are=\r\n giving!!!), then a sannyasi\n better isolate oneself from the world and nei=\r\nther give nor take (except absolute essentials for survival). But, when one=\r\n progresses beyond some level, it is a good idea to &quot;give&quot; what one is in a=\r\n position to give others.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;The purpose of life is to give and not t=\r\no take, though some taking is unavoidable in the process of giving. Focus o=\r\nn what you give and not on what you take.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt; can one achieve moksha still in family life\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Yes.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Y=\r\nou are still not old enough.

This force is based on the mome=\r\nntum from various notions one was exposed to and various desires one entert=\r\nained, during various lives. It is called &quot;mental conditioning&quot;.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;C=\r\nan it be controlled?

I am doing it wi=\r\nthout revealing your identity.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; if he didnt go to the queen for mere enjoyment of sex ,if he didnt indulg=\r\ne himself&lt;br&gt;&gt; mindfully in the deed?&amp;enjoy it,he went only for a re=\r\nason he is not the karman,atma&lt;br&gt;&gt; cannot be polluted,realising this sa=\r\nnkara went to the queen&amp;thus he is still as sacred&lt;br&gt;&gt; as ever?&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Though correct, this is a dangerous notion for most people. True,=\r\n atma cannot be poluted and is beyond desires and actions. But most people =\r\ndo not identify with atma. They\n identify with a perishable body. So all th=\r\ne talk of &quot;all is atma and atma is pure&quot; is just theory.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Atma =\r\nis like an ocean in which waves and rippes arise and move. Ocean does not g=\r\net shattered when ripples hit each other and stays the same. But bodies, mi=\r\nnds and other perishable objects arising in atma are like waves and ripples=\r\n arising and moving in ocean. They increase, decrease, get shattered etc. O=\r\nne identifying with the ocean of atma is beyond happiness and sadness. One =\r\nidentifying with the ripple of a body will experience happiness, sadness et=\r\nc.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Suppose one is watching a movie and knows that it is not re=\r\nal and just a movie. Still, when a really scary scene comes, one may be sta=\r\nrtled. Mere intellectual understanding that it is not real and just a movie=\r\n, is not enough. It has to be ingrained fully in one&#39;s instincts. Similarly=\r\n, intellectually knowing that all this is a play and not real, is not enoug=\r\nh. When some really\n pleasurable and painful event happens, one WILL identi=\r\nfy with the body and experience something.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If Shankara was ful=\r\nly enlightened before that episode (we don&#39;t know that for sure), then the =\r\naction would not have bound him. Otherwise, it would&#39;ve created a rina. If =\r\nhe experienced some pleasure, he would create a new rina to the queen, to v=\r\narious deities (!) who live within one&#39;s consciousness and operate various =\r\nparts of one&#39;s body and mind, and to various beings in his virya who may ha=\r\nve been significantly affected. He would have to pay those debts back later=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;There is nothing absolutely sacr=\r\ned or dirty about any action. It is the intent and attitude of the actor th=\r\nat makes an action sacred or dirty. Self-centered actions are more dirty th=\r\nan selfless actions geared at others. More so, the denser and more selfish =\r\none&#39;s\n conditioning. &lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; but kno=\r\nwing this still he performed his rituals for his mother?did he do&lt;br&gt;&gt; t=\r\nhis for love or respect or pity or just to balance his runa?&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;O=\r\nnly still ocean does not have any ripples or their movement. Similarly only=\r\n ummanifest atma (Self after dissolution/pralaya and before new srishti/cre=\r\nation) does not have any objects and actions within it. Atma during a srish=\r\nti cycle does have many objects within it and many actions between them.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Thus, realizing Self does NOT mean sitting still in a forest and=\r\n doing nothing. Various bodies keep doing various actions. A realized perso=\r\nn identifies with atma and actions by various people seem to him/her like h=\r\nis/her actions. One does not particularly identify with what one&#39;s old body=\r\n specifically does (based on previous momentum).&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Nature uses\n =\r\nsuch realized people to set good examples for the world. So they do engage =\r\nin some actions. They have no pride or shame, no happiness or sadness and d=\r\no whatever spontaneously occurs to them.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Shankara performing l=\r\nast rites for mother would&#39;ve made Mother happy. Moreover, it would set an =\r\nexample for future. One&#39;s interaction with the world is give &amp; take. We=\r\n give things to others and take things from them. True renunciation is in r=\r\nenouncing what we take. There is no need to renounce giving. As the prevant=\r\n notion of sannyasa was to cut off from the world, Shankara demonstrated gi=\r\nving others (e.g. mother) sannyasa.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Swami Vivekananda and Swam=\r\ni Sivananda took this further. They engaged in a lot of service for the soc=\r\niety, unlike other sannyasis who lock themselves in isolation.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;Of course, if the act of &quot;giving&quot; increases pride (i.e. you are &quot;taking&quot; s=\r\nomething in return of what you are giving!!!), then a sannyasi\n better isol=\r\nate oneself from the world and neither give nor take (except absolute essen=\r\ntials for survival). But, when one progresses beyond some level, it is a go=\r\nod idea to &quot;give&quot; what one is in a position to give others.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Th=\r\ne purpose of life is to give and not to take, though some taking is unavoid=\r\nable in the process of giving. Focus on what you give and not on what you t=\r\nake.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; can one achieve moksha =\r\nstill in family life&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Yes.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;You are still not old e=\r\nnough. Focus on your studies for the next 3-4 years. But, eventually, you c=\r\nan read &quot;Yoga Vasishtham&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; s=\r\ntill iam in silly thoughts....ya can man controll his thoughts100%?]&lt;br&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;br&gt;Various good and bad thoughts come to mind\n continuously, for it is =\r\nthe nature of mind! As long as one is alive, the force that runs one&#39;s exis=\r\ntence creates thoughts in the mind. This force is based on the momentum fro=\r\nm various notions one was exposed to and various desires one entertained, d=\r\nuring various lives. It is called &quot;mental conditioning&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Can i=\r\nt be controlled? Yes, in the sense that one can add new notions and new des=\r\nires to this driving force and the its direction can be slowly refined over=\r\n time.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Mind is the problem and mind is the key to the solution=\r\n as well. Use mind to change the direction of mind.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t kn=\r\now about 100%, but I do not know one can modify one&#39;s thinking over time.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; Spiri=\r\ntuality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;deleted&=\r\ngt;,&lt;br&gt;if atma is in us and atma is the part of akhanda jyoti swaroop[the =\r\ngod-all in one fire form] and the man knew\n that pleasure of the realizatio=\r\nn like sankara did....&lt;br&gt;if he didnt go to the queen for mere enjoyment of=\r\n sex ,if he didnt indulge himself mindfully in the deed?&amp;enjoy it,he we=\r\nnt only for a reason he is not the karman,atma cannot be polluted,realising=\r\n this sankara went to the queen&amp;thus he is still as sacred as ever?&lt;br&gt;=\r\nbut knowing this still he performed his rituals for his mother?did he do th=\r\nis for love or respect or pity or just to balance his runa?&lt;br&gt;i have read&#39;=\r\n&#39;ruaanubandha ruupena pasu patni sutaalayah&quot;did he want to balance his runa=\r\n?or..but still he is a sarvasanghaparityagi...why may he have done it?what =\r\nmay he be telling us through this deed?&lt;br&gt;&lt;deleted&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;deleted&=\r\ngt; can one achieve moksha still in family life if he really realises atman=\r\n if the above assumption is true..then how can one realise atman?is it a fe=\r\neling or a substratum?what is it made upof?&lt;br&gt;still iam in silly thoughts.=\r\n...ya can man controll his\n thoughts100%?]&lt;br&gt;iam extremely sorry...but...i=\r\n couldnt resist asking you for &lt;deleted&gt;&lt;br&gt;really sorry for botherin=\r\ng...&lt;br&gt;namaskaram....&lt;br&gt;good night...&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;&lt;deleted&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;=\r\n/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;meta http-equi=\r\nv=3D&quot;x-dns-prefetch-control&quot; content=3D&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\n/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--1411505736-1912622227-1338270401=:86386--\r\n\n"}}
