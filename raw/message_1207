They think that Rudra is \nfull of fire and fire worship increases the fire and bathing cools down the \nfire.\n\nHowever, any deity can be called in fire, even fiery deities. There is no \nharm in calling a fiery planet like Mars or Sun in fire and doing homam with \ntheir mantras, as suggested by Maharshi Parasara (father of Vyasa). Also, \nRudra homam is done at many temples. Traditionally, homam is done with \n1/10th of the count of Rudrabhishekam.\n\nRudra is like a bowman who releases the fruits of your karmas like an arrow. \nHomam really accelerates this. Moreover, Rudra namakam is a long veda mantra \nand it is nearly impossible for most of us to pronounce it correctly. Just \nlike Chandi homam, one should do Rudra homam if one is surrendered to the \nLord and prepared to face the music for ANY karmas done before and be done \nwith them. Of course, after a few painful blocking karmas are gotten over \nwith, one can make tremendous spiritual progress. But, if one wants to go \nslowly, I suggest that Chandi homam and Rudra homam are not for that person.\n\nI wanted to distribute a manual for a Shiva homam with simple Shiva mantras. \nBut, somehow, the inspiration from inside has not come yet and it has not \nhappened.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, February 17, 2009 3:55 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: MahaShivaratri - Shiva Homa Manual\n\n\n&gt; Namaste ray.siya1@... !\n&gt;\n&gt; As everybody knows, traditionally Lord Shiva (In Linga form) is\n&gt; mostly worshiped with Water/Milk Abhishek.\n&gt;\n&gt; Technically speaking, Fire worship would be better, in my opinion as\n&gt; you know that Fire is the un-currepted element left besides Ether.\n&gt; i.e. Fire element is more purer than water element in the current\n&gt; times.\n&gt;\n&gt; Let&#39;s try worshiping him with &#39;Fire&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; pS: Vo to Bhole Baba hai.
