The half moon in the (fore)head.  Soma means mo=\r\non. \n \nLike that we can see at a number of places the word Soma is coming. =\r\n This soma is not accessible to sinful persons, to persons who do not have =\r\na pure mind. Means persons like Rishis have the access to it (with pure min=\r\nd).  Only people with pure mind can locate, visualize, distinguish such pla=\r\nnts which are having high medicinal properties and coolest in nature.  \n \n =\r\n\nYou may remember that In mahAbhArat, the Bhishma goes to kAshi king and fo=\r\nrcefully brings the three brides, Amba, Ambika and Ambalika and gives to vi=\r\nchitraveerya.  Vichitraveerya  is bedridden due to the disease TB. These th=\r\nree names are the names of three plants in vEdAs having highest medicinal v=\r\nalues.  \n \n \nThese plants who are able to distinguish, could be the real an=\r\nd purest medicine for treatment in TB. \n \nThe mruthyunjaya mantra   thriamb=\r\nakam yajAmyahe suganddhim pushtivarddhanam...etc    triambakam =3D means  t=\r\nhree ambAs.  It is Amba, Ambika and AmbAlika.  Put them into the homaKunda =\r\nand do the yajnA,  (it will give you suganddhi and pushti vardhak).\n \n \nTru=\r\nst you must have got a small idea about Soma, the nectar availability to Ri=\r\nsh etc\n \n \nBest of luck\nVijayan\nunquote\n\nThanks & regards\n\nGanesh Gulati\n\n-=\r\n-- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;gulatiganesh&quot; &lt;gulatiganesh@...&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Group Members,\n&gt; \n&gt; The following is the meaning given to me by =\r\nmy named Guru Shri \n&gt; Bhooshan Priya Ji. \n&gt; \n&gt; &#39;This is what the  Maha Mrit=\r\nyunjaya mantra means:\n&gt; \n&gt;  Sukracharya said &quot;The first pada is Triyambakam=\r\n Yajamahe and means -\n&gt;  we worship or sing the praise of Lord Trayambaka. =\r\nTryambaka is the \n&gt; name of Lord Shiva as the father of the three worlds - =\r\nbhu, bhuva \n&gt; and svarga lokas. He is the father and lord of the three mand=\r\nala&#39;s - \n&gt; Surya, Soma and Agni mandala. He is Maheswara, the lord of the t=\r\nhree \n&gt; Guna&#39;s - Satva, Rajas and Tamas. He is the Sadashiva, the teacher o=\r\nf \n&gt; the three tatvas - Atma tatva, Vidya tatva and Shiva tatva. He is \n&gt; t=\r\nhe father (cause and source) of the three energies (agni) - \n&gt; Aavahaniya, =\r\nGarhapatya and Dakshinagni. He is the father of all \n&gt; physical creation th=\r\nrough the three murti bhuta - Prithvi (solid), \n&gt; Jala (liquid) and Tejas o=\r\nr agni (energy). He is the lord of the \n&gt; three heavens created by the domi=\r\nnance of the three Gunas - Rajas \n&gt; (Brahma), Satva (Vishnu) and Tamas (Shi=\r\nva). Know Him to be the \n&gt; nirakara (formless) Sadashiva as He is above thi=\r\ns physical mode and \n&gt; is their Maheswara. This is the first foot of the ma=\r\nntra (composed \n&gt; of eight syllables).&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The second pada of the mantra=\r\n,&quot; continued Sukracharya, &quot;is  \n&gt; Sugandhim Pushtivardhanam. Sugandhim refe=\r\nrs to the fragrance of the \n&gt; flower that spreads in all directions, and in=\r\n a similar way Shiva is \n&gt; present in the entire creation, both animate and=\r\n inanimate. In all \n&gt; the bhutas (modes of existence), in the three Gunas (=\r\nnature of \n&gt; creation as being Satva, Rajas or Tamas), in the ten indriyas =\r\n(five \n&gt; gyana-indriyas or senses and five karma-indriyas or organs of \n&gt; a=\r\nction), in all the devas (33 devas are the source of all \n&gt; illumination an=\r\nd enlightenment) and the ganas (hosts of demi-gods),  \n&gt; Shiva exists and p=\r\nervades as the illumine atma (soul) and is their \n&gt; essence. Pustivardhanam=\r\n is now being explained. That inward dwelling \n&gt; spirit (atman), the Purush=\r\na Shiva is the real sustainer of Prakriti \n&gt; (and not vice-versa as all peo=\r\nple perceive). Starting with the \n&gt; mahatatva (primordial state of matter/e=\r\nnergy) to the individual \n&gt; parts of creation, the entire sustenance of the=\r\n physically created \n&gt; beings (both animate and inanimate) is done by the i=\r\nmperishable \n&gt; Purusha. You, I, Brahma, Vishnu, the Munis and even Indra & =\r\ndevas \n&gt; are maintained/sustained (by the atma and that is Him). Since the =\r\n\n&gt; Purusha (atma - Shiva) is the granter of sustenance to prakriti \n&gt; (body=\r\n/nature), he is &#39;Pusti-vardhana&#39;.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Having explained the first two pada=\r\n of the mantra, Sukracharya \n&gt; continued to explain the remaining two pada.=\r\n He said &quot; the next two \n&gt; pada (consisting of sixteen syllables) is  Urvar=\r\nukamiva Bandhanam \n&gt; Mrityormukshiya mamritat meaning - Prabhu! just as the=\r\n ripe cucumber \n&gt; is severed from the bondage of the creeper, in the same m=\r\nanner may \n&gt; we be delivered from death for the sake of immortality (moksha=\r\n). \n&gt; Rudra deva is like amrita (nectar of immortality). Those who worship =\r\n\n&gt; Him with good karma, penance and repentance, meditation, \n&gt; contemplatio=\r\nn, prayer or praise, will surely renewed life and vigor. \n&gt; The strength of=\r\n truth force (in this mantra) is such that Lord Shiva \n&gt; shall definitely f=\r\nree the worshipper from the bondage of death \n&gt; because Shiva alone is the =\r\ngiver of bondage and moksha. \n&gt; \n&gt; This is the Mritasanjivani mantra and ha=\r\ns the power to give back \n&gt; life and rescue from death and great evils. You=\r\n should adore Lord \n&gt; Shiva and recite this mantra. Water sanctified with t=\r\nhis mantra \n&gt; should be drunk all the time. [Authors note: It is well known=\r\n that \n&gt; the rudraksha bead is placed in a glass of water after being held =\r\nin \n&gt; the palm during the recitation of the mantra. this water is drunk \n&gt; =\r\nduring the day.]\n&gt; \n&gt; Oblations in the sacrificial fire with this mantra is=\r\n very \n&gt; purifying. Now I shall teach the dhyana for the mantra.&quot; Saying so=\r\n, \n&gt; Sukracharya started reciting the shlokas for meditating on Lord \n&gt; Shi=\r\nva.&#39;\n&gt; \n&gt; Trust this is also available for the general viewing and clarity =\r\nfor \n&gt; the members of the Group\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you all for providing your valua=\r\nble view on the matter and \n&gt; enligten me on the subject\n&gt; \n&gt; Ganesh Gulati=\r\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
