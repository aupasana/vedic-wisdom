Chandipath can take anywhere from one hour to 4 =\r\nhours, depending on how familiar one is with the text.\n\nHowever, several pe=\r\nople have learnt the text in the last few years and doing homam with it eve=\r\nryday. With practice, things that seemed impossible once may become easy.\n\n=\r\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nManish told me in 2006 that several people close to us from=\r\n previous lives are slowly coming together and about to=C2=A0 start serious=\r\n sadhana. He said that they will all do homam and eventually do Chandi homa=\r\nm regularly - the chosen sadhana in this life - and make brisk progress in =\r\na few years of time to prepare themselves for the main task ahead. When he =\r\nsaid that, I did not take him seriously. Chandi homam is considered very co=\r\nmplex and even many professional priests do not do it daily. The idea of se=\r\nveral people doing Chandi homam daily seemed almost impossible. Though I wa=\r\ns quite comfortable with the text by then, I did not think at that time tha=\r\nt even I would oneday start doing Chandi homam daily.\n\nBut, just 4 years la=\r\nter, it is amazing that there are several people doing Chandi homam daily. =\r\nIn my neighborhood itself, 3 people do Chandi homam daily (with 700 verses)=\r\n. I know that several people are doing all over the world.=C2=A0 Some of th=\r\ne people doing Chandi homam now were once ritual novices who were not even =\r\nused to lighting a lamp or doing even minor poojas. I realize now that noth=\r\ning is really impossible when a rishi or a deity decides.\n\nDo not consider =\r\nanything impossible. If you really practice, it will become so easy.\n\nThoug=\r\nh it is possible to do something else in the interim, I really think you sh=\r\nould practice the entire Chandipath.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nIn the interim, one p=\r\nossibility is to do a homam using the beeja mantra you mentioned. Another p=\r\nossibility is to do using the 4th or 11th chapter only. It is possible to d=\r\no with Durga suktam or Devi suktam also, but my gut feeling is that you may=\r\n not pronounce them well. It is better for you to do with a pouraanika mant=\r\nra or a beeja mantra.\n\nA homam with the Durgaa Saptashloki (7 verses select=\r\ned from the 700) repeated several times is an idea. Doing homam just with t=\r\nhe verse &quot;sarva mangala maangalye...naaraayani namostu te&quot; is also an idea =\r\nin your case.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nAnswers to your followup questions:\n\n(1) The=\r\n sankalpa I have given in the manual can be used without modification. It w=\r\nas designed to be generic.\n\n(2) Either is fine. This being a pournaanika ma=\r\nntra, there is no need for a specific intonation. You can say &quot;swaahaa&quot; wit=\r\nh any intonation or just plainly.\n\n(3) Yes, you can use a photo of your kul=\r\na devata. In fact, you can do just with fire too, i.e. without an idol.\n\nUs=\r\ne the word &quot;chitra&quot; or &quot;paTa&quot; or &quot;chitrapaTa&quot; instead of &quot;moorthi&quot; (moortho=\r\nu=3Dchitre or paTe or chitrapaTe when invoking, moortheh=3Dchitraat or paTa=\r\nat or chitrapaTaat when sending off).\n\n(4) Uploading a Chandi homam video m=\r\neans uploading atleast 1.5 hours of video. I do not know of any site that a=\r\nllows that. If only the beginning is needed, that is possible. I will talk =\r\nto Ravi and see if that can be done.\n\nDo you live near Mumbai? If so, you c=\r\nan perhaps visit Rajarshi and his friends who do Chandi homam regularly and=\r\n see it live.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------\n=C2=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish =\r\nLessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam =\r\nand Pitri Tarpana:\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAstrologer=\r\n.org\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a difference: http://Saraswat=\r\niFilms.org\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/g=\r\nroup/vedic-wisdom\n=C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jy=\r\notishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------\n\n--- On Thu, 2/4/10, Girish &lt;gisundar@...&gt; wrote:\nFrom: Girish=\r\n &lt;gisundar@...&gt;\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Query on Chandi Homam\nTo: ved=\r\nic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Thursday, February 4, 2010, 12:58 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      Namaskarams Narasimhaji and other =\r\nMasters,\n\nI have been following the discussions on Aghori practices and acc=\r\nounts in the smashan bhumi homams with great interest and curiosity.
