The\nstyle of this prashna is such that namaH is said only once for each\npair of two names. eg. &quot;namaH somAya ca rudrAya ca&quot;. So also, the\nrelevant snippet is &quot;namaH shivAya ca shivatarAya ca&quot;. namaH applies\nboth to shiva and shivarata. In the rudra trishati (where namah is\nadded to each name), the same mantra is said as &quot;namaH shivAya ca\nnamaH&quot;.\n\nbhavadIyaH,\n\n        ajit\n\n\nOn Jan 7, 2008 4:15 PM, Dinesh Nambisan &lt;dinesh@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Would appreciate learned folks here dispensing the reasons behind why\n&gt; this mantra in particular is flipped the other way around compared to\n&gt; other mantras (e.g. Om Gurave Namah, Om Gan Ganapathaye Namah etc),\n&gt; surely there is some spiritual/philosophical/mythological significance?\n\n"}}
