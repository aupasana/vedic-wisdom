This particular goddess, according to my guru, attracts others \nto a sadhaka and gives &quot;control and mastery&quot; over others.\n\nI want to share what I realized towards the end of sadhana, because that \nrealization MAY be helpful to some others.\n\n*        *        *\n\nDIFEERENT TRAJECTORIES\n\nThere are beings that can give specific limited things, but the ultimate \ngoal of sadhana is liberation and sadhana of higher beings eventually \ntransforms one and takes one closer to liberation. What these higher \nbeings are supposed to give in tradition is a simplificaation or \nsymbolism of something sublime that takes towards liberation, from \n*different angles*.\n\nFor example, ability to work very hard (with no expectations of anything \nselfish in return), fine judgment and discrimination (that increases \ndetachment in one&#39;s actions), complete surrender to god (and \nwhole-hearted acceptance of every life situation one finds oneself in), \nability to focus mind (on a mantra or a deity and not let various \nthoughts distract it), are all useful to a sadhaka. If one develops one \nof these 4 basic qualities, other qualities will eventually develop. \nThey all lead to the same thing - liberation - in the end, but the \ntrajectory is different.\n\nThese four basic paths constitute what are known as karma yoga \n(communion through action), jnana yoga (communion through wisdom), \nbhakti yoga (communion through devotion) and raja yoga (communion \nthrough [self-]control). However, there are many sub-paths.\n\nBasically, different higher beings can increase a different fine quality \ninside one, which is conducive to liberation. The trajectory is \ndifferent with each deity.\n\n*        *        *\n\nTOO MUNDANE?\n\nThe higher being I worshipped is supposed to increase control and \nmastery over others. While I did the sadhana in the last few months, I \nwondered how *that* can lead to liberation. After all, control and \nmastery over others sounded too *mundane* to me to have anything to do \nwith liberation. But a simple realization came towards the end of the \nsadhana.\n\n*        *        *\n\nCONTROL & FRICTION\n\nWhether A is attracted to B or B is attracted to A, the bottomline is \nthat objects A and B come together. The ability to attract others also \nmeans to come together with them.\n\nOne is unhappy with others and thinks of controlling them, when one&#39;s \nown agenda is mis-aligned with their agenda. The friction between the \nagendas is the basis for the entire dynamics of likes, dislikes, \nfrustrations etc. Control of that friction comes when the agendas are \nnicely aligned!\n\nAbility to control the agenda pursued by someone else has limited use, \nscope and lifetime. Such an ability can work only with a limited set of \npeople or a limited amount of time. This is like pumping rainwater from \nthe fields surrounding a hill to the top of the hill. It requires a lot \nof energy that is proportional to the area of the field and the amount \nof rainwater.\n\nThe best way to avoid the friction, with ALL beings of the cosmos, is to \neliminate one&#39;s own agenda! This is like removing the hill from the \nmiddle of the field, in the above analogy.\n\nIf one has no agenda whatsoever, then there is no friction with anyone&#39;s \nagenda. There is no reason to like or dislike anyone or find fault with \nor admire anyone. One can just observe others. Because one has no \nagenda, one can identify with the agendas of others and relate to them \ncompletely. One can then put oneself completely in the shoes of others \nand feel their pleasures, pains etc.\n\nWhen one has an agenda and another has another agenda, then there is \nfriction and one feels a need to &quot;control&quot; and remove friction. But, \nwhen one has no agenda and another has an agenda, then there is no \nfriction. One can then completely &quot;understand&quot; the perspective of the \nother (because there is no friction from one&#39;s own agenda stopping one \nfrom doing so!). What better mastery and control can one have on someone \nelse than be able to understand that person completely?!\n\nThough what I described above is the end, one path to that end is to \nidentify one&#39;s own agenda/conditioning that is resulting in friction, \nwhenever one is not happy with someone, and try to remove/suppress that \nconditioning. One can first try this with a few people (e.g. spouse).\n\n*        *        *\n\nLOVE & COMPASSION FOR ALL\n\nBottomline is this: Control and mastery over others does not mean making \nthem think and behave in tune with the agenda of one&#39;s own limited \nconditioning. Instead, it means overcoming&#39;s one&#39;s own agendas and being \nable to put oneself in the shoes of anybody and understand and feel each \nof their feelings and emotions. It means unconditional love and \ncompassion for all.\n\n*        *        *\n\nLOOKING DOWN ON OTHERS\n\nWhen one is doing some sadhana, one of the stages one goes through may \nbe to feel proud of one&#39;s sadhana, look at some others doing such a \nsadhana favorably or with admiration and look down on others who are not \ndoing much sadhana (or doing a different sadhana!) and pursuing mundane \nthings. This may be a natural tendency, but realize that this is a work \nof the limited personality or ego.\n\nOne has to overcome that tendency, for looking down on others will \neventually block one.\n\n*        *        *\n\nLOVING THE DIVINE MOTHER\n\nPeople talk of loving the Divine Mother. The personality of Divine \nMother is beyond one&#39;s perception. How can one really love Her then?\n\nOne may do tremendous sadhana and get tremendous visions and think that \none has grasped the personality of Divine Mother, but what one perceives \nis merely what one&#39;s conditioning fancies and is capable of grasping! \nThe complete personality of Divine Mother is beyond anybody&#39;s \nperception.\n\nHowever, Divine Mother does manifest in a perceptible way as the cosmos. \nEvery being in the cosmos is a limited manifestation of Her. Being able \nto love every being is the FIRST step in truly loving the Divine Mother.\n\nLoving someone because they are doing some good work (as we see it!) or \nbecause they have something we need (as we see it!) etc, is *egoistic* \nloving. Such love is *conditioned* by the agendas of a limited ego. Such \nlove cannot extend to entire cosmos and permanently. The only love that \ncan extend to entire cosmos and be permanent is unconditional love of \nall beings.\n\nThat comes only when one has no agenda and no expectations from anyone.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}}
