I know from experience that \n&gt; the energy in the=\r\n air is US is too raajasik and taamasik. I found India \n&gt; and even south Ko=\r\nrea to be much better.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even in US, there are regions where excellent s=\r\nadhana was done in the \n&gt; past (perhaps by native Americans, knowns as Amer=\r\nican Indians). Those \n&gt; places are conducive to sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; If a place is=\r\n not conducive to sadhana, it does not mean that you should \n&gt; not do sadha=\r\nna there or that sadhana there is invalid or useless. It \n&gt; only means that=\r\n sadhana there encounters more obstacles and one needs to \n&gt; put in more ef=\r\nfort for the same results.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fire ritual with an external fire of reason=\r\nable size is superior to \n&gt; normal meditation in enabling mental calmness, =\r\nclarity and spiritual \n&gt; progress. One doing that in western countries WILL=\r\n derive benefits. \n&gt; Fire&#39;s company can override the other undesirable comp=\r\nany one may have \n&gt; (i.e. negative energies in the air).\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW, India is=\r\n also slowly becoming a &quot;bhoga bhoomi&quot;. Though there are \n&gt; some genuine yo=\r\ngis doing sadhana on that land, more and more people are \n&gt; falling prey to=\r\n selfishness, wantonness and brazen materiasm.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasim=\r\nha\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; =\r\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It =\r\nYourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;              =\r\n      http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       Films that make a difference: =\r\nhttp://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/gro=\r\nup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyotis=\r\nhWritings\n&gt;                       Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; -----------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Tue, Aug 23, =\r\n2011 at 8:06 PM, Ram Ramachandran wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;     Namaste,\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I hav=\r\ne heard people say that India (and some parts of SE Asia) is the \n&gt; &quot;Karma =\r\nBhoomi&quot;, and America is considered a &quot;Bhoga Bhoomi&quot;, and as such \n&gt; even ni=\r\nthya karmas like Oupaasanam performed in the USA are not valid.=C2=A0 \n&gt; Si=\r\nnce Oupaasanam is the basis for many of the sroutha and smatth karmas, \n&gt; t=\r\nhose karmas, inlcuding Deva yajnas and pitru yajnas, are not valid \n&gt; outsi=\r\nde of India.=C2=A0 Is this true?\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I am new to this group and I tr=\r\nied my best to search for an answer to \n&gt; the above but did not find one.
