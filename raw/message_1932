Vasishtha reveals the true=\r\n nature of Rama then and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rama remains in samadhi. Vasishtha has =\r\nto finally enter the Sushumna nadi of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rama to disturb his samadh=\r\ni and bring him back to senses.

Krish=\r\nna knew it from the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beginning. In the case of Rama, sages like V=\r\nasishtha, Vishwamitra knew it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; even before Rama&#39;s birth, but Rama=\r\n himself did not know it in the beginning. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But he too knew it la=\r\nter.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, Krishna had complete mastery over the du=\r\nality, while Rama did not. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rama had to wade the dual world like =\r\nnormal people.
