My parents and elders called me Meenakshi. I was happy with my\nparents.\n=\r\n\nIn the meantime, my father took sannyasa and became one of the leading\ndev=\r\notees of Sri Ramana Bhagavan. (The father&#39;s name was Dandapani Swami).\nLate=\r\nr, my father went to Palani with Bhagavan&#39;s permission, constructed an\nashr=\r\nam in South Giri Street, and lived there for some time. While he was\nthere =\r\nhe came to our house in Rayapuram. During his visit, he gave a copy of\nAksh=\r\naramanamalai (The Marital Garland of Letters) to my husband. My husband\nwen=\r\nt through them and after four days informed me that he was going to\nThiruk =\r\nkazhi Kunram. However, instead, he went straight to Tiruvannamalai.\n\nWhen h=\r\ne saw Bhagavan, he felt that his whole body was burning. He wept and\ncried =\r\nout complaining of a burning sensation without knowing what it was.\nThe att=\r\nendants around Bhagavan thought that he was mad. One attendant, Sri\nRamakri=\r\nshna Swami rubbed lemon juice on his head and poured pots of water\nover him=\r\n. He stayed there for several days doing tapas and having Bhagavan&#39;s\ndarsha=\r\nn. Then he returned to Madras and his job, but he had little interest\nin hi=\r\ns work.\n\nThen he began to go to Tiruvannamalai on all Saturdays and Sundays=\r\n for one\nyear. After my mother-in-Iaw&#39;s first annual ceremony, and without =\r\ninforming\nme, he resigned his job and went to Ramanathapuram. My neighbours=\r\n\ntelegrammed to my brother about my problem and he came to see me. Both of =\r\nus\nwent to the school and met the headmistress who was an English lady She =\r\nsaid\nthat he had resigned his job and left. I began to weep and she console=\r\nd me\nby saying that God would help me.\n\nThen I went to Ramanathapuram with =\r\nmy brother and Muruganar came to visit us\nthe night we arrived. I held his =\r\nfeet and wept. I requested him to point out\nmy faults if any that made him =\r\nleave me alone. He gave me no reply. Then I\nwent to Raghava Iyengar, a grea=\r\nt Tamil scholar in the town and told him\nabout my troubles. Raghava talked =\r\nto my husband but his words had no effect.\n\nMeenakshi&#39;s father, Dandapani S=\r\nwami was a permanent inmate of the Sri\nRamanasramam. Her father presented h=\r\ner husband, Sri Muruganar a copy of the\nAksharamanamalai sometime after her=\r\n marriage.\n\nA few days later, Sri Muruganar left home permanently for the a=\r\nshram without\ntelling anyone. &quot;From that day he was totally absorbed in Bha=\r\ngavan&quot;, she\nsays.&quot;Searching for him I reached Sri Ramanasramam. I found him=\r\n and yet did\nnot find him for he was wholly Bhagavan&#39;s now.&quot;\n\nMuruganar sta=\r\nyed near the temple in town with Eswaraswamigal and Gopal Rao.\nThey used to=\r\n go begging for their food at noon. Muruganar used to sit alone\nin Subraman=\r\niya Temple in the evening. One evening, acting on Santhammal&#39;s\nadvice, I ca=\r\nught hold of his feet and asked, &quot;What mistake have I done? Why\ndid you lea=\r\nve? What will be my future? &quot; In response he opened neither his\nmouth nor h=\r\nis eyes.\n\nSoon after this incident; someone brought a piece of verse to the=\r\n hall and\nput it before Bhagavan. Bhagavan wanted Muruganar to read it and =\r\nsaid:\n&quot;Muruganar has been absent for the last two days. What is the reason?=\r\n &quot; In\nresponse to this I went to Bhagavan and told him what I did at the te=\r\nmple on\nSanthammal&#39;s advice. Bhagavan got angry with me and said, &quot;Why did =\r\nyou act\nlike that on that woman&#39;s advice. You see, while he was here, you c=\r\nould see\nyour husband. But now he has disappeared, what will you do? Hereaf=\r\nter, don&#39;t\ntake other&#39;s advice and don&#39;t give trouble to Muruganar.&quot;\n\nOne d=\r\nay, all the devotees were sitting in the hall. I was in tears again.\nBhagav=\r\nan asked me. &quot;Why are you crying again? Did some body tease you?&quot; I\nsaid, &quot;=\r\nNo one talked against me but I thought of my miserable life and the\ntears j=\r\nust came.&quot; Bhagavan said, &quot;Why don&#39;t you take my advice? What is\nthere in t=\r\nhe family life. See, your father has ten children, but they are\nnot helping=\r\n him. What is the use? I am always here with you. Nothing will\nhappen, don&#39;=\r\nt worry.&quot; Thus Bhagavan consoled me.He said, &quot;Go only to the\nhouse who call=\r\ns you affectionately, Meenakshi &#39;. The Ashram will take care\nof you.&quot;\n\nBhag=\r\navan then told Muruganar that he has not left him in the streets, but\nMurug=\r\nanar has left Meenakshi in the streets. Muruganar got up laughing, but\nBhag=\r\navan asked him to give a reply before getting up, but he went away\nwithout =\r\nsaying anything.\n\nThen Bhagavan said, &quot;I tried in so, many ways. It is of n=\r\no use. God alone\nwill look after you. &quot;\n\nBhagavan was very kind to me.\n\nHis=\r\n grace must be with me forever .....\n\nSource: http://bhagavan-ramana.org/mu=\r\nruganarhowicametobhagavan.html\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=\r\n=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=\r\n=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=\r\n=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--001485f92a906bbd60048adb5648\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:=\r\nrgb(51, 51, 51)&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-botto=\r\nm:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nI was born the sixth daughter =\r\nof Sri Periyakulam Krishna Iyer and Kanakammal on the fourth day of Panguni=\r\n month, Saleevagna Sahabdha, 1823 (17-3-1902).
