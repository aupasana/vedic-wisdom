I=\r\n do it always, irrespective of consequences. So your mail and view point is=\r\n thoroughly welcome as far as I&#39;m concerned.\n\nI will try to explain a few p=\r\noints from your reply, as I see it.\n\n&lt;&lt;It is not their identity that you se=\r\ne, it is the identity which we have been exposed to since ages. Just an ana=\r\nlogy, Tendulkar may actually be a great father at home but we only saw the =\r\nperceivable cricketer aspect of him as it is known to your outside world wh=\r\nich dwells on popularity or a pronounced thing. Kali is dreadful Goddess to=\r\n many who see her physical aspect but I did see many homes in Kolkata prayi=\r\nng her as family Goddess. All experiences are PERSONAL in nature between us=\r\n and the deity and can be abstract from a different view point.&gt;&gt;\n\n\nYou see=\r\n my basic point is that Tendulkar is a cricketing genius to 120 Crore India=\r\nns, while his identity as a father is limited to 2 children. If you approac=\r\nh Tendulkar and call him father, he may feel weird about it.=C2=A0 Now deit=\r\nies of course are far more subtle and complex. One of names of Kaali in her=\r\n sahashranama is also=C2=A0Lalita. If you worship Kaali and expect Her to c=\r\nome to you in the form of Lalita, because the Sahasrahanama of=C2=A0Kaali h=\r\nas the name Lalita,=C2=A0=C2=A0chances are that=C2=A0it may result in=C2=A0=\r\na hodgepodge. In the worst case it may result in fright. To give a very cru=\r\nde example, this is like buying the DVD for the movie &quot;The Exorcist&quot; while =\r\nconsciously and sub-consciously expecting to see &quot;Kaho Na Pyar Hai&quot;!\n\nYes K=\r\naali is the most worshipped deity in Bengal for various historical reasons,=\r\n chief of which being that fantastic amount of Kali worshippers have lived =\r\nin Bengal/Assam/Tripura/Odisha. This has caused=C2=A0the notion of Kali to =\r\nget ingrained in the very culture. Even sufis in Bengal worship Kaali. But =\r\nthe key is to accept Her and love Her, AS SHE IS! Which means, say if you f=\r\nind the garland of skulls on her neck and the skull in her hand disturbing,=\r\n or if you find the blood-dripping from the freshly cut head in Her hand di=\r\nfficult to relate to, you cannot cannot replace=C2=A0those from her iconogr=\r\naphy and expect to get clear results from your worship. Love Her the way Sh=\r\ne is, in her ferocity and wildness and beauty. When you do that, you&#39;re gam=\r\ne.=C2=A0Yes She=C2=A0can be dreadful, but that is how She is loved by her d=\r\nevotees, without trying to modify Her innate nature and characteristics. Re=\r\nlate to Her as Ma, but don&#39;t ask Her to remove the skulls. \n\nThe=C2=A0tradi=\r\ntional=C2=A0idea, which I believe to be correct,=C2=A0is to worship the for=\r\nm in the way it is and love and relate to it in all its attributes. I know =\r\na certain person who used to=C2=A0worship a very fierce form of Devi but me=\r\nntally was=C2=A0unable to relate to that form. She was adviced by her guru =\r\nto do so, who used to worship that fierce form himself. When I asked her wh=\r\nat does she feel about the deity, she said I mentally think of Her of Gouri=\r\n but perform the ritual for the fierce form=C2=A0as my Guru asked me to. I =\r\nof course had no business interfering in the relationship between a Guru an=\r\nd his disciple and so kept my mouth shut, but personally I was extremely sk=\r\neptical of this approach. When you can&#39;t even love=C2=A0the form you are wo=\r\nrshipping, then what kind of worship is that? Later she met another individ=\r\nual who acted as a mentor and gave her a mantra of a much milder form of Go=\r\nd. Today=C2=A0the lady spends nearly=C2=A08 hours every day immersed in the=\r\n worship of\n that milder=C2=A0form. Her spiritual life leap-frogged once sh=\r\ne started worshipping the milder form of God. Thats why the Tantras stress =\r\nso heavily on the importance of=C2=A0correct form for each individual. \n\n\n\n=\r\nIt is not my contention that worshipping an urga deity is difficult or simp=\r\nle compared to worshipping a milder form. Both are difficult and to succeed=\r\n in any worship=C2=A0a combination of various factors must fall in place. I=\r\nt&#39;s like trying to judge, which among Rugby and Table-tennis, is a more dif=\r\nficult game. Some like one, some like the other, but you cannot pass a judg=\r\nement about which is more dificult. \n\n-Take Care\n=C2=A0 Rajarshi\n\n\n________=\r\n________________________\nFrom: Srikanth &lt;srikanthnetworked@...&gt;\nTo: v=\r\nedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \nSent: Wednesday, 21 December 2011 8:09 PM\nSubj=\r\nect: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mahavidya experience\n\n\n=C2=A0 \nJai Maa Durge.\n\n=\r\nRajarshiji,\n\nAgain, My two cents with my own humble understanding:\n\nIt is n=\r\not their identity that you see, it is the identity which we have been expos=\r\ned to since ages.

I worship the Durga energies of her when I go on the karmic field and =\r\nworship her play as Lalitha when I enjoy the bhoga(healthy body,Mind,Intell=\r\nect and Materials) she gave me unasked.\n\nI would not want to argue but you =\r\nwill find many such ugra names in &quot;Gayathri Sahasranaam&quot; too.\n=C2=A0\nThis s=\r\nynergistic concept of the Divine Mother was pursued in the sacred literatur=\r\ne on Mother worship\nacross many centuries.

These five corpses are of=C2=A0Brahma, =\r\nVishnu, Rudra, Mahadeva and Sadashiva. Simply put, She is representative en=\r\nergy of everything. Personally, I don&#39;t like this explanation. To me the fi=\r\nve pretas are the five koshas surrounding the human organism. She controls =\r\nall of them.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Now if we take this line=C2=A0literally, She sits on =\r\nan asana of five pretas - spirits of a kind. You must have read the biograp=\r\nhies of many siddhas who worshipped Lalita Tripursundari. How many have you=\r\n found who has had a vision of Her in this form, sitting on corpses? The La=\r\nlita Sahashranama is a complete text of ALL possible attirbutes of Lalita T=\r\nripursundari. Of these, what percentage of names do you find which can be d=\r\nescribed as ugra?\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Consider this example. If you ask 100 people who=\r\n is Sachin Tendulkar, all will reply that he is a great cricketer. But isn&#39;=\r\nt Tendulkar also a father, brother, son, husband, a responsible citizen of =\r\nIndia, a consumer at the local grocery store, and for all you know maybe ev=\r\nen a reasonable bathroom singer? These are all his identities too. But why =\r\ndon&#39;t we refer to them when we speak of Tendulkar? Because his central defi=\r\nning identity for us is his cricket.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Same way, each deity eventual=\r\nly is everything. But each has its own &quot;defining identity&quot; which has its ow=\r\nn set of attributes. Of all the people worshipping Lalita Tripursundari at =\r\nthis very moment, probably a 2 percent or less=C2=A0will realize Her in thi=\r\ns lifetime. Of these, 99.9999999999999999999 percent will realize Her ONLY =\r\nin Her=C2=A0chief identity as Lalita. How many will, or have till date, act=\r\nually realized that form of Lalita Tripursundari sitting on a pretasana?

What=\r\n does that mean since Mahavidya worship is NOT \n&gt;&gt;&gt; recommended by you.

Just an analogy, Tendulkar may actually be a great=\r\n father at home but we only saw the perceivable cricketer aspect of him as =\r\nit is known to your outside world which dwells on popularity or a pronounce=\r\nd thing. Kali is dreadful Goddess to many who see her physical aspect but I=\r\n did see many homes in Kolkata praying her as family Goddess. All experienc=\r\nes are PERSONAL in nature between us and the deity and can be abstract from=\r\n a different view point.&gt;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;You =\r\nsee my basic point is that Tendulkar is a cricketing genius to 120 Crore In=\r\ndians, while his identity as a father is limited to 2 children. If you appr=\r\noach Tendulkar and call him father, he may feel weird about it.&nbsp; &lt;VAR =\r\nid=3Dyui-ie-cursor&gt;&lt;/VAR&gt;Now deities of course are far more subtle and comp=\r\nlex. One of names of Kaali in her sahashranama is also&nbsp;Lalita. If you =\r\nworship Kaali and expect Her to come to you in the form of Lalita, because =\r\nthe Sahasrahanama of&nbsp;Kaali has the name Lalita,&nbsp;&nbsp;chances are=\r\n that&nbsp;it may result in&nbsp;a hodgepodge. In the worst case it may res=\r\nult in fright. To give a very crude example, this is like buying the DVD fo=\r\nr the movie &quot;The Exorcist&quot; while consciously and sub-consciously expecting =\r\nto see &quot;Kaho Na Pyar Hai&quot;!&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;Yes Kaali is the most worshipped deity in Bengal f=\r\nor various historical reasons, chief of which being that fantastic amount o=\r\nf Kali worshippers have lived in Bengal/Assam/Tripura/Odisha. This has caus=\r\ned&nbsp;the notion of Kali to get ingrained in the very culture. Even sufis=\r\n in Bengal worship Kaali. But the key is to accept Her and love Her, AS SHE=\r\n IS! Which means, say if you find the garland of skulls on her neck and the=\r\n skull in her hand disturbing, or if you find the blood-dripping from the f=\r\nreshly cut head in Her hand difficult to relate to, you cannot cannot repla=\r\nce&nbsp;those from her iconography and expect to get clear results from you=\r\nr worship. Love Her the way She is, in her ferocity and wildness and beauty=\r\n. When you do that, you&#39;re game.&nbsp;Yes She&nbsp;can be dreadful, but tha=\r\nt is how She is loved by her devotees, without trying to modify Her innate =\r\nnature and characteristics. Relate to Her as Ma, but don&#39;t ask Her\n to remo=\r\nve the skulls. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D=\r\n&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;The&nbsp;traditional&nbsp;idea, which I believe to be correct=\r\n,&nbsp;is to worship the form in the way it is and love and relate to it in=\r\n all its attributes. I know a certain person who used to&nbsp;worship a ver=\r\ny fierce form of Devi but mentally was&nbsp;unable to relate to that form. =\r\nShe was adviced by her guru to do so, who used to worship that fierce form =\r\nhimself. When I asked her what does she feel about the deity, she said I me=\r\nntally think of Her of Gouri but perform the ritual for the fierce form&nbs=\r\np;as my Guru asked me to. I of course had no business interfering in the re=\r\nlationship between a Guru and his disciple and so kept my mouth shut, but p=\r\nersonally I was extremely skeptical of this approach. When you can&#39;t even l=\r\nove&nbsp;the form you are worshipping, then what kind of worship is that? L=\r\nater she met another individual who acted as a mentor and gave her a mantra=\r\n of a much milder form of God. Today&nbsp;the lady spends\n nearly&nbsp;8 ho=\r\nurs every day immersed in the worship of that milder&nbsp;form. Her spiritu=\r\nal life leap-frogged once she started worshipping the milder form of God. T=\r\nhats why the Tantras stress so heavily on the importance of&nbsp;correct fo=\r\nrm for each individual. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=\r\n=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;It is not my contention that worshipping an urga deity is =\r\ndifficult or simple compared to worshipping a milder form. Both are difficu=\r\nlt and to succeed in any worship&nbsp;a combination of various factors must=\r\n fall in place. It&#39;s like trying to judge, which among Rugby and Table-tenn=\r\nis, is a more difficult game. Some like one, some like the other, but you c=\r\nannot pass a judgement about which is more dificult. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;R=\r\nIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;-Take Care&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&nbsp; Rajarshi&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=\r\n=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, serif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, serif; FONT-S=\r\nIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BORDER-BOTTOM: #ccc 1=\r\npx solid; BORDER-LEFT: #ccc 1px solid; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; LINE-HEIGHT: 0;=\r\n MARGIN: 5px 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; HEIGHT: 0px; FONT-=\r\nSIZE: 0px; BORDER-TOP: #ccc 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #ccc 1px solid; PADDIN=\r\nG-TOP: 0px&quot; class=3Dhr contentEditable=3Dfalse readonly=3D&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;=\r\nSPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Srikanth &lt;srikanthnetw=\r\norked@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Sent:=\r\n&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Wednesday, 21 December 2011 8:09 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-W=\r\nEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mahavidya experienc=\r\ne&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;META content=3Doff http-equiv=3Dx-dns-prefetch-control&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot; id=3Dyiv1604633329&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;S=\r\nPAN style=3D&quot;DISPLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1604633329ygrp-text=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Jai Maa Durge.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rajarshiji,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Again, My two cents with my=\r\n own humble understanding:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is not their identity that you see, it=\r\n is the identity which we have been exposed to since ages. Just an analogy,=\r\n Tendulkar may actually be a great father at home but we only saw the perce=\r\nivable cricketer aspect of him as it is known to your outside world which d=\r\nwells on popularity or a pronounced thing. Kali is dreadful Goddess to many=\r\n who see her physical aspect but I did see many homes in Kolkata praying he=\r\nr as family Goddess. All experiences are PERSONAL in nature between us and =\r\nthe deity and can be abstract from a different view point.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Our Subje=\r\nctive experience is based on density of&nbsp; Karmas and the associated Vas=\r\nanas accumulated over several births coupled with your present life (Intens=\r\nity of it depends on several variables in/out of our control) Sadhana. Moth=\r\ner will reveal the respective band of her spectrum as you progress\n further=\r\n using your free will carefully is my view exactly as your physical mother =\r\nknows when you feel hungry and not in right frame of mind etc etc.(Though o=\r\nver simplified a bit)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In general we all wish to pursue sadhana with =\r\na thought that she is not very far away and we indeed have a chance to reac=\r\nh her or abide by her.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I&#39;m an ant at the foot hills of a mountain an=\r\nd cannot talk about a glorious mountain like &quot;Sri Lalitha Devi&quot;. I worship =\r\nthe Durga energies of her when I go on the karmic field and worship her pla=\r\ny as Lalitha when I enjoy the bhoga(healthy body,Mind,Intellect and Materia=\r\nls) she gave me unasked.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I would not want to argue but you will find=\r\n many such ugra names in &quot;Gayathri Sahasranaam&quot; too.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;This syne=\r\nrgistic concept of the Divine Mother was pursued in the sacred literature o=\r\nn Mother worship&lt;BR&gt;across many centuries.

Thus, t=\r\nhe Divine Mother assumes all the characteristics at one time:the wisdom and=\r\n spiritual intellect of Saraswati, the redeeming spirit of Durga, the wealt=\r\nh, splendour,and cornucopia of Lakshmi or Sri, and the terribleface of Kali=\r\n or Gouri.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Medh=C4=81si devi vidit=C4=81khila-=C5=9B=C4=81stra-s=C4=\r\n=81r=C4=81&lt;BR&gt;durg=C4=81si durga-bhavas=C4=81gara-naur-asa=E1=B9=85g=C4=81;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;=C5=9Ari=E1=B8=A5 kai=E1=B9=ADabh=C4=81ri-h=E1=B9=9Bdayaika-k=E1=B9=9Bt=\r\n=C4=81dhiv=C4=81s=C4=81&lt;BR&gt;gour=C4=AB tvam-eva =C5=9Ba=C5=9Bi-mauli-k=E1=B9=\r\n=9Bta-prati=E1=B9=A3=E1=B9=ADh=C4=81.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Cordially Srikanth&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV class=3Dyiv1604633329gmail_quote&gt;On Wed, Dec 21, 2011 at 4:25 PM, rajarsh=\r\ni nandy &lt;SPAN dir=3Dltr&gt;&lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:rajarshi14@...&quot; rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:rajarshi14@...&quot;&gt;rajar=\r\nshi14@...&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEF=\r\nT: rgb(204,204,204) 1px solid&quot; class=3Dyiv1604633329gmail_quote&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;/U&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(255,255,255)&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(255,255,255); FONT-FAMILY: t=\r\nimes new roman, new york, times, serif; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Dear Srikanth,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Sometime back this question was asked by a friend of mine. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3Dyiv1604633329im&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SP=\r\nAN&gt;&lt;&lt;&quot; Pancha Pretasanasina, Panch Brahmaswarupini&quot; The one who sits =\r\non 4 corpses etc&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;and &quot;Aparna Chandika Chanda Mundasura Nishudini&quot;&gt=\r\n;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Traditio=\r\nnally, so I am told, this verse is ment to understand that She sits on a th=\r\nrone held by five corpses. These five corpses are of&nbsp;Brahma, Vishnu, R=\r\nudra, Mahadeva and Sadashiva. Simply put, She is representative energy of e=\r\nverything. Personally, I don&#39;t like this explanation. To me the five pretas=\r\n are the five koshas surrounding the human organism. She controls all of th=\r\nem.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Now if we take t=\r\nhis line&nbsp;literally, She sits on an asana of five pretas - spirits of a=\r\n kind. You must have read the biographies of many siddhas who worshipped La=\r\nlita Tripursundari. How many have you found who has had a vision of Her in =\r\nthis form, sitting on corpses? The Lalita Sahashranama is a complete text o=\r\nf ALL possible attirbutes of Lalita Tripursundari. Of these, what percentag=\r\ne of names do you find which can be described as ugra?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;S=\r\nPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Consider this example. If you ask 100 pe=\r\nople who is Sachin Tendulkar, all will reply that he is a great cricketer. =\r\nBut isn&#39;t Tendulkar also a father, brother, son, husband, a responsible cit=\r\nizen of India, a consumer at the local grocery store, and for all you know =\r\nmaybe even a reasonable bathroom singer? These are all his identities too. =\r\nBut why don&#39;t we refer to them when we speak of Tendulkar? Because his cent=\r\nral defining identity for us is his cricket.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Same way, each deity eventually is everything. But=\r\n each has its own &quot;defining identity&quot; which has its own set of attributes. =\r\nOf all the people worshipping Lalita Tripursundari at this very moment, pro=\r\nbably a 2 percent or less&nbsp;will realize Her in this lifetime. Of these,=\r\n 99.9999999999999999999 percent will realize Her ONLY in Her&nbsp;chief ide=\r\nntity as Lalita. How many will, or have till date, actually realized that f=\r\norm of Lalita Tripursundari sitting on a pretasana? And why is this form&nb=\r\nsp;so remote and so uncommon for most standard worshippers of Lalita Tripur=\r\nsundari? These are questions to ponder!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I&#39;ve very little knowled=\r\nge of worship of Sri Lalita Tripursundari, either theoritical or from the p=\r\noint of practical worship,&nbsp;but if there is beauty in this world, it is=\r\n Her.&nbsp;Like a five course gourmet&nbsp;meal, like a sublime poetry, lik=\r\ne&nbsp;an efforlessly brilliant music, like a dazzling play of lights, like=\r\n a classic Tendulkar shot,.... all these combined together and much much&nb=\r\nsp;more ...you feel and wish that it never comes to an end. It is difficult=\r\n to describe the feeling that She evokes, but it&#39;s like a flood of pure, di=\r\nstilled essence of&nbsp;beauty and you feel like there is nothing more to b=\r\ne done, no goal to reach, no path to walk, no battles to fight -&nbsp;simpl=\r\ny bask in the depth of the moment because therein lies fullfilment and a wh=\r\nole new world! She banishes the very roots of the sense of strife and uglin=\r\ness from your system... the knowledge that She exists is enough to incapaci=\r\ntate you from asking anything\n more. She is THE greatest&nbsp;poetry of all=\r\n possible Universes of all possible cycles of creation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\nSPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;-Regards=\r\n&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; COLOR: navy; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#0=\r\n00000 face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;COLOR: rgb(0,0,102)&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN=\r\n style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 16px&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#a2a2a2 size=3D3&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/S=\r\nPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;VAR&gt;&lt;/VAR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, serif; FONT-S=\r\nIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, se=\r\nrif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 0px&quot;&gt;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Srikanth &lt;&lt;A hr=\r\nef=3D&quot;mailto:srikanthnetworked@...&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ym=\r\nailto=3D&quot;mailto:srikanthnetworked@...&quot;&gt;srikanthnetworked@...&lt;/A=\r\n&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;mai=\r\nlto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D=\r\n&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Wednesday, 21 Decembe=\r\nr 2011 2:19 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; =\r\nRe: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mahavidya experience&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3Dy=\r\niv1604633329h5&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;All,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nIf we take a Soumya (according to us) Devata like Sri Lalita Tripura Sundar=\r\ni, how do we correlate to the following verses from Lalitha Sahasranaam:&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; Pancha Pretasanasina, Panch Brahmaswarupini&quot; The one who sits on 4 c=\r\norpses etc&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;and &quot;Aparna Chandika Chanda Mundasura Nishudini&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I=\r\nn my little sadhana I have done with Maha Vidyas, I found that we are actua=\r\nlly praying the spectrum and not the Specific Frequency Band.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Soumya=\r\n and Ugra are Gunas of human mind and are used by Mother like a toy when sh=\r\ne wants and throws it away and she is beyond Gunas. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The dream you h=\r\nad could be your minds projection too or it could be your psyche which is g=\r\netting adjusted to her mantra and best way is to approach MOTHER with Utmos=\r\nt Love and Respect.

Please develop a personal relationship with Maa and assume he=\r\nr in your heart with physical form and see the\n magic.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;I utter=\r\nly fail to explain her POWER.

The=\r\ny bestow different aspects of Supreme Knowledge. &lt;BR&gt;Worshipping them for w=\r\ninning a court case or getting a job (which many &lt;BR&gt;people try to do today=\r\n) is like trying to use a missile to crush an ant.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Regarding your dr=\r\neam, it may be genuine or merely a projection of your &lt;BR&gt;mind. Remember th=\r\nat mind is very powerful and projects various conscious &lt;BR&gt;and sub-conscio=\r\nus conditioning as its experiences, especially in a &lt;BR&gt;dream.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If yo=\r\nu feel that the dream is a genuine experience of the devata, then &lt;BR&gt;keep =\r\ndoing\n the mantra and see what happens.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you had the same experien=\r\nce with another mahavidya, it is possible &lt;BR&gt;that your mind is just projec=\r\nting. If your mind has affinity to a soumya &lt;BR&gt;devata with certain nature,=\r\n it may imagine whichever devata you worship &lt;BR&gt;to have that nature!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;If your mind is imagining an Ugra devata as a benign smiling form, &lt;BR&gt;pe=\r\nrhaps you should stick to a Soumya Devata. If the devata really gives &lt;BR&gt;y=\r\nou a darshan in a fierce form, is your mind capable of handling it? If &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nyour mind can visualize and perceive an Ugra Devata in a truly fierce &lt;BR&gt;f=\r\norm and yet feel deep love and surrender for her, then only you are &lt;BR&gt;sui=\r\ntable for such a sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Good luck in your sadhana!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best reg=\r\nards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;-----------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A\n h=\r\nref=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http=\r\n://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Films that make a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;=\r\nhttp://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://Saraswati=\r\nFilms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ved=\r\nic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ved=\r\nic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jyotish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group=\r\n/JyotishWritings&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gr=\r\noup/JyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Twitter ID: @homam108&lt;BR&gt;-----------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Hello,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; One =\r\nof the Mahavidyas I got a mantra from an astrologer and did it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; for=\r\n 40 days, but with 5 days of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sadhana, it&#39;s was so cool , but got a =\r\nreal vison in dream of what they &lt;BR&gt;&gt; call ugra devata , but Smiling&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; at me???
