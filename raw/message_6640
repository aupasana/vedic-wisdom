I would like to suggest from my own m=\r\nethod which may help you bring down 20 minutes to 10Min.\n\n1) First of all, =\r\nIt is advisable to avoid Aluminum Foil. Aluminum foil cutting for correct s=\r\nize and then adjusting on Homa kundam takes a good amount of time. I did it=\r\n for some 6 months initially and then there was a Message from Narasimha th=\r\nat it is better to avoid Aluminum foil because Aluminum being a relatively =\r\nmodern metal and may carry Rahu&#39;s predominance. I stopped foil since then..=\r\n.\n\n2) No need to wash Homa Kundam every day. I do it once in a month or so.=\r\n Let it be black and dark.\n \nIf the above 2 points are observed, it can sav=\r\ne some 5 to 7 minutes easily.\n\nNow, one can do following arrangements previ=\r\nous nights (the people who do Homa in the morning)\n\n-Empty the Homa Kundam =\r\nand keep it clean (Tissue papers are very handy for this) and ready for nex=\r\nt morning\n- Keep the Dry Coconut pieces or Wood ready.\n- Keep the Lamp read=\r\ny with Wick\n- Keep Camphor, Rice mixed with ghee and turmeric, Flowers,  et=\r\nc... ready. (I do not use flowers any more. Use Akshatas mixed with Turmeri=\r\nc as flowers..Bhagwan ko bolta hun BhavnaO ko Samjho! Phul ki jagape Chawal=\r\n se kaam chalalo:-)\n\nSo when I get ready for Homam, I just have to fill up =\r\nthe copper tumbler with water and heat up the ghee and few other such activ=\r\nities which takes around 5to7 Minutes in total.\n\nBefore i forget i must rem=\r\nind that there is no need to keep the Darbha in 4 directions every time. On=\r\ne can keep those Darbhas at the same place as many days as possible.\n\n\nPlea=\r\nse ignore this Fool if the post did not make much sense.\nYours,\n\nHavanOtpal=\r\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; That was=C2=A0a nice post Ajit. I am also one of those people who, beca=\r\nuse of guilt factor of skipping sandhyavandana, unable to do the homa daily=\r\n. I do it every week. But there is a little other logistics issue for me. I=\r\n live in the US and I do my homa in my living room where the Wood burning F=\r\nireplace (east facing)=C2=A0is located. My pooja room however, is in a diff=\r\nerent location towards north of the house. I have a big Shiva Lingam in my =\r\npooja room for which I do daily abhishekam in the morning, (with Rudra Adhy=\r\naya on Mondays). So, if I have do both nithyapooja and homam daily, it is r=\r\neally time taking as arranging for homam takes almost 20 minutes, on a rout=\r\nine basis. Any ideas for managing this better? For instance, arrangements i=\r\nnclude, \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; 1. cleaning up the previous homam residues, \n&gt; 2. putti=\r\nng new aluminium foil in the homa kunda and below the homakunda, \n&gt; 3. putt=\r\ning aluminium foils before the homa kunda where I keep the ghee so that any=\r\n spills would happen on the foil, \n&gt; 4.cleaning the Kalasa, putting chandan=\r\n and kumkum for kalas, putting askshatas pouring water, putting a flower in=\r\n the kalasa.\n&gt; 5. preparing an oil lamp\n&gt; 6. putting darbhas around the hom=\r\na kunda\n&gt; 7. putting starter wood block in the homa kunda along with campho=\r\nr and darbhas\n&gt; 8. melting the gree \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; All these take from 15-20 m=\r\ninutes. If I have time, I do have a ninth step of cooking some food for mah=\r\nanaivedyam which takes an additional 20-30 minutes. With all these, doing a=\r\n homam and regular pooja in=C2=A0a different place is really difficult on a=\r\n daily basis. But I want to do that. Any ideas for keeping it simple? \n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; Nagraj=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sun, 6/26/11, Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishna=\r\nn@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re=\r\n: [vedic-wisdom] Homa kunda : Iron or copper, other questions..\n&gt; To: vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Sunday, June 26, 2011, 12:06 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lastly, I did not find any homam manual tha=\r\nt goes along with sandhya vandanam ! Someone I respect, mentioned of AupAsa=\r\nna homam ...\n&gt; \n&gt; In the past, I have asked exactly the same question.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n If you are not already doing sandhyAvandana and aupAsana (and are\n&gt; doing =\r\nhoma), don&#39;t worry about it. Just skip this mail altogether. If\n&gt; you are d=\r\noing sandhyAvandana, don&#39;t want to stop doing it (because of\n&gt; the guilt fa=\r\nctor), and want to better integrate it with homa, this\n&gt; mail may be of som=\r\ne limited value. I have studied several\n&gt; sandhyAvandana, aupAsana and homa=\r\n manuals.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many traditions split sandhyAvandana into two parts: (a) pur=\r\nificatory\n&gt; rites and (b) gAyatri-japa. If you want to integrate with homa,=\r\n do\n&gt; homa between parts (a) and (b). The first part, with the mArjana etc\n=\r\n&gt; hardly takes 1-2 minutes. After that, do the homa. After the purnahuti\n&gt; =\r\netc, you can do the second part of sandhyAvandana (gayatri japa)\n&gt; starting=\r\n with the AvAhana. Spend as much time in this meditation as\n&gt; you can. Then=\r\n, you can do the upasthAna etc, which will add another 2\n&gt; minutes or so. C=\r\nonsider skipping all the elaborate nyAsas, and the\n&gt; repeated prAnAyAmas.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Really speaking, everything important is already there in the homa\n&gt; ma=\r\nnual. From the &quot;full sandhyAvandana&quot; procedure, you can pull in a\n&gt; few ved=\r\na mantras if you choose to. But, it really isn&#39;t necessary.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you loo=\r\nk at aupAsana procedures, you will find that Narasimha&#39;s\n&gt; manual is more e=\r\nlaborate than the aupAsana. Homa is basically a\n&gt; superset of aupAsana. Whe=\r\nre the manual differs, it is more relevant\n&gt; for our modern lifestyle, and =\r\nyou don&#39;t need to add anything to it.\n&gt; Frankly, I basically follow Narasim=\r\nha&#39;s manual, but say &quot;aupAsana&quot; in\n&gt; the sankalpa. They are that similar. T=\r\nhe fire in which you do\n&gt; &quot;upAsana&quot; is &quot;aupAsana&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; bhavadiiyaH,\n&gt; \n&gt; a=\r\njit\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
