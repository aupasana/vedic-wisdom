In tarpana why is specific importance given to=\r\n Sesame?\n\n2. As I know it one cannot do puja for some days when somebody in=\r\n the family has expired. Similarly can one do Japa during that period? \n\n3.=\r\n I collect water used during tarpana in a vessel. Now can that water be tak=\r\nen inside the house. The reason I am asking this is because I throw that wa=\r\nter on plants and for that I have to go through rooms in the house as the p=\r\nlants are kept elsewhere.\n\n4.Restrictions are mentioned in the documents fo=\r\nr certain days, what happens if we could not follow that by mistake?\n\n5. In=\r\n one Gita press book it is mentioned that those desiring servants, children=\r\n and female should not do tarpan. I see that you did not mention this.\nIs t=\r\nhis really applicable ?\n\nThank you for the manuals !!\n\nThank you,\nManish\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n      Add more friends to your messenger and enjoy!
