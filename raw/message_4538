I am going\ninto it.... Wow !\n\nI did not actually=\r\n experience going into the white light; I must have\nblinked or something.  =\r\nOne instant I was about to enter it and the next\ninstant I was inside of it=\r\n.  I was inside some kind of bubble - a bit\nlike a cobweb eggshell, or one =\r\nof those string lamp shades that gather\nall the dust.  I was aware of mysel=\r\nf inside this thing; like an embryo\nin an egg of some kind; or shell.  It w=\r\nas the first time that I could\nactually see anything of myself since all th=\r\nis began.  I was somehow\nsitting all cramped up like a bloody chicken in an=\r\n egg; wondering as to\nwhat was on the outside which was so bright; and as t=\r\no what the hell was\ngoing on now.  But thinking did not come easy at that p=\r\noint, and perhaps\nsimply more instinctive than rational thinking.  But I co=\r\nuld still think\nsomehow.  Beyond this `bubble&#39; which I was cooped up in was=\r\n a pure\nradiance of brilliant and dazzling white light.  A blinding light. =\r\n  Not\nthe soft gentle white light that I had previously been in prior to th=\r\nis.\n\nI had an instinctive urge of wanting to scratch my way out of this\nbub=\r\nble or whatever it was, or at least see as to what was outside of it.\nBut t=\r\nhere was no form to scratch at.  I could not touch anything even\nthough I s=\r\neemed to have some kind of physical form of some kind.  I\nthink it must hav=\r\ne been simply too bright and blinding to see properly. \nI suddenly realised=\r\n that the light was getting brighter and even\nbrighter by the second; blind=\r\ning and more blinding all the time. Or\nperhaps more light was getting in th=\r\nrough the mesh of this thing\nsomehow. I began to see something - or more tr=\r\nue to say `know&#39;\nsomething: but what is it... I&#39;m not sure...  No, no no it=\r\n can&#39;t be...\nit is... good grief almighty... the thing outside... it is... =\r\nit is ME !\n(With that thought, that event, that vision and knowledge - I wa=\r\ns dead;\ngone; finished).  I saw no form of anything other than brilliant an=\r\nd\nblinding light yet I knew that something outside was myself; it was made\n=\r\nobvious; axiomatic; absolute knowledge.  My being, my consciousness,\nstarte=\r\nd spinning, swooning somehow, spinning in a giddiness like a\nvortex of wate=\r\nr going down a bath plug hole: a vortex of self existence\ndiminishing into =\r\nnothingness.  I knew that my bubble was disintegrating\nin the light... and =\r\nso was I...  I am going... I am being damn well\nannihilated, melted down, d=\r\nisintegrating, burnt out, annihilated.  It\ncame to pass that everything end=\r\ned; everything had gone; and I was gone.\nI and the universe were no more.  =\r\nIt was the end of time.\n\n*       *       *\n\n  But that was only back to the=\r\n beginning.
