Human body =\r\nis naturally suited for an omnivorous diet. Just like \n&gt;\n&gt; people do not ea=\r\nt raw meat, normally, people do not eat raw vegetables as well. \n&gt;\n&gt; Cookin=\r\ng is a later addition to human society. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; If you were to clear your =\r\nmind of all preconcieved ideas and look at REAL \n&gt; research in the most unb=\r\niased way possible, and accessed scientific papers in \n&gt; clinical nutrition=\r\n and dietetics, as latest as 2010 june/july, you would find \n&gt; ample eviden=\r\nce that humans as a speicies, for many milleniums have relied on an \n&gt;\n&gt; om=\r\nnivorous diet:-\n&gt; \n&gt; a) Human ancestral diets changed substantially approxi=\r\nmately four to five \n&gt; million years ago with major climatic changes creati=\r\nng open grassland \n&gt; environments. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; b) Humans developed a larger br=\r\nain balanced by a smaller, simpler \n&gt; gastrointestinal tract=C3=82  requiri=\r\nng=C3=82 foods based around meat protein and fat. \n&gt;For \n&gt;\n&gt; example since =\r\nthe time of Australopithecus afarensis, some four to five million \n&gt;\n&gt; year=\r\ns ago, brain size has increased threefold - chemical requirement for \n&gt; lon=\r\ng-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid chains in the brain - without a \n&gt; corre=\r\nsponding increase in the Basal Metabolic Rate. This is possible only with \n=\r\n&gt;a \n&gt;\n&gt; diet that is rich is animal protein. Simply put, in layman terms, o=\r\nur brain \n&gt; would not have reached the size and mass as it is today, had it=\r\n not been for \n&gt; diet comprising of meat, fruits and vegetables. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; c=\r\n) The gut morphology of the human body as it stand todays is ideally \n&gt; equ=\r\nidistant from that of carnivores as well as herbivores. That is because \n&gt; =\r\nhumans are designed to be omnivores. The lack of a well developed caecum an=\r\nd \n&gt; rumen, unlike herbivores, makes it difficult for the body to absorve p=\r\nlant \n&gt; cellulose into usable energy, which is why, a=C3=82 major part of t=\r\nhe leafy \n&gt;vegetable \n&gt;\n&gt; based diet eventually ends up as roughage. On the=\r\n other hand, the stomach \n&gt;lining \n&gt;\n&gt; of humans do not contain=C3=82  the =\r\nkind of strong acids which is present in a \n&gt;typical \n&gt;\n&gt; carnivore. This i=\r\ns because, humans, diet as set by Nature through=C3=82  the natural \n&gt;\n&gt; pr=\r\nocess of evolution is supposed to be omnivorous. It may further interest yo=\r\nu \n\n&gt; to know that the teeth structure of humans is actually identical to, =\r\nguess \n&gt;what, \n&gt;\n&gt; rats who also are omnivores.\n&gt; \n&gt; d) It may shock many a=\r\n preconcieved and mistaken ideas that=C3=82 research into \n&gt; clinical nutri=\r\ntion very clearly indicates that absorption ability of the human \n\n&gt; body f=\r\nor=C3=82 w.r.t different foods=C3=82 is highest (not vegetables or fruits) =\r\nfor \n&gt;fish, \n&gt;\n&gt; and lowest for red meat and carrots. Infact the later is c=\r\nonsidered negative \n&gt; calorie food, since it requires the body to waste mor=\r\ne calories in absorving it \n&gt;\n&gt; than the amount it gains from them.

Human body is =\r\nnaturally suited for an omnivorous diet. Just like &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; people do not =\r\neat raw meat, normally, people do not eat raw vegetables as well. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Cooking is a later addition to human society. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; If you were to clear your mind of all preconcieved ideas and look at REAL=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; research in the most unbiased way possible, and accessed scienti=\r\nfic papers in &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; clinical nutrition and dietetics, as latest as 2010=\r\n june/july, you would find &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ample evidence that humans as a speici=\r\nes, for many milleniums have relied on an &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; omnivorous diet:-&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; a) Human ancestral diets changed substantially approximately =\r\nfour to five &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; million years ago with major climatic changes creati=\r\nng open grassland &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; environments. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; b) =\r\nHumans developed a larger brain balanced by a smaller, simpler &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ga=\r\nstrointestinal tract=C3=82&nbsp; requiring=C3=82&nbsp;foods based around me=\r\nat protein and fat. For &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; example since the time of Australopithecu=\r\ns afarensis, some four to five million &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; years ago, brain size has =\r\nincreased threefold - chemical requirement for &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; long-chain polyuns=\r\naturated fatty acid chains in the brain - without a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; corresponding=\r\n increase in the Basal Metabolic Rate. This is possible only with a &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; diet that is rich is animal protein. Simply put, in layman terms, our br=\r\nain &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; would not have reached the size and mass as it is today, had =\r\nit not been for &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; diet comprising of meat, fruits and vegetables. &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; c) The gut morphology of the human body as it =\r\nstand todays is ideally &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; equidistant from that of carnivores as we=\r\nll as herbivores. That is because &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; humans are designed to be omniv=\r\nores. The lack of a well developed caecum and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; rumen, unlike herbi=\r\nvores, makes it difficult for the body to absorve plant &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; cellulose=\r\n into usable energy, which is why, a=C3=82&nbsp;major part of the leafy veg=\r\netable &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; based diet eventually ends up as roughage. On the other ha=\r\nnd, the stomach lining &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of humans do not contain=C3=82&nbsp; the k=\r\nind of strong acids which is present in a typical &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; carnivore. This=\r\n is because, humans, diet as set by Nature through=C3=82&nbsp; the natural =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; process of evolution is supposed to be omnivorous. It may further=\r\n interest you &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to know that the teeth structure of humans is actua=\r\nlly identical to, guess what, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; rats who also are omnivores.&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; d) It may shock many a preconcieved and mistaken ideas that=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;research into &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; clinical nutrition very clearly indicates =\r\nthat absorption ability of the human &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; body for=C3=82&nbsp;w.r.t di=\r\nfferent foods=C3=82&nbsp;is highest (not vegetables or fruits) for fish, &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; and lowest for red meat and carrots. Infact the later is considered=\r\n negative &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; calorie food, since it requires the body to waste more =\r\ncalories in absorving it &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; than the amount it gains from them. But =\r\nfish is the easiet to digest. You can &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; look up actual BV (biologic=\r\nal value)=C3=82&nbsp;charts for more details.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; All this i=\r\ns science. Real science.
