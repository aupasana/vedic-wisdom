Most such statements in folklore are neither \nentirely incorrect nor fully accurate. One needs the right context and \nperspective to understand.\n\nThe microcosm inside us reflects the entire universe. By harnessing the \nability of consciousness to focus on some things, it may be possible to \ncreate changes inside and outside. But what that requires is a certain \nstate of mind. A densely conditioned mind cannot focus on anything. A \nmind that overcame most of its conditioning can focus well and \naccomplish things.\n\nTo remove internal conditioning, we engage in various external practices \n(such as pooja, homam etc). External symbols cause resonance inside and \nmodify internal conditioning with time. For example, when we do homam, \nexternal fire resonates with the internal fire (aspect of consciousness \nthat burns conditioning) and one progresses.\n\nSimilarly, external smashana where bodies are burnt will cause resonance \ninside consciousness and promote an &quot;internal smashana&quot; where \nconditioning dies, burns and disappears.\n\nCreate an internal smashana in your mind, where various types of \nconditioning and various wants, agendas, likes and dislikes are killed \nand put to rest so as to not rise again. Without a good internal \nsmashana, sadhana done in an external smashana will not be that \neffective. With a good internal smashana, sadhana done anywhere will be \nvery effective.\n\nYes, for a few, sitting in an external smashana and seeing the play of \nNature will be conducive to creating an internal smashana. If so, one \ncan go and sit in a smashana. But, if one with dense conditioning goes \nto a smashan and does a sadhana with high expectations of certain \nresults (spiritual or material), because one read that smashana sadhana \nis powerful for begetting results, one may be deluding oneself.\n\nJust my 2 cents, take it or leave it...\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n\n"}}
