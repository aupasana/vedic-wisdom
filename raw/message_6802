Kavachas of various deities (or \nplanets) are protective sheaths covering one&#39;s consciousness and \nstopping harmful influences.\n\nGrahas (literal meaning: those who grasp or get hold of) give good and \nbad results by grasping one&#39;s consciousness and affecting it.\n\nEach planet has positives and negatives, in general and also based on \nthe chart. If one chants the kavacha of a planet many times, eventually \na protective sheath is formed around one&#39;s consciousness with the nature \nand energy of that planet. This will obviously offer protection that is \nconsistent with the nature of that planet, in general and in one&#39;s \nchart. But, please remember that reading the kavacha of any planet will \nNOT harm you. Even the kavacha of 8th lord or 6th lord will not harm \none.\n\nSuppose one has Pi lagna. If he chants Sukra kavacha, Venus will protect \none from loss of courage (3rd), problems to shoulders (3rd), untimely \ndeath (i.e. loss of longevity/8th), problems in anus/genital area (8th) \netc. There may be other things based on other factors like aspects, \noccupancy etc. Based on his inherent nature, Venus may also protect in \nthe matters of love, romance, creativity etc also. Bottomline is that \nthe aspects of one&#39;s personality that the planet is conducive to will be \nprotected by the planet&#39;s energy.\n\nIf you pick a wrong planet, you may not get the desired result, but no \nharm is done. Even bad planets in your chart will have some aspects they \nwant to protect and doing their kavacha will protect those aspects.\n\nBest will be to chant the kavachas of lagna lord, dispositor of lagna \nlord, Moon&#39;s dispositor and Sun&#39;s dispositor. Even better will be to \nchant the kavachas of devatas instead of planets. Out of all the \nkavachas I have seen until now, Narayana kavacha (from SrimadBhagavatam) \nand Chandi Kavacha are the most potent kavachas.\n\nBut please note that chanting a kavacha once or twice or even once or \ntwice a day is hardly sufficient. If one has enough purity already, most \nmantras work right away. But most of us have very dense conditioning and \nthe energy of mantras gets dispersed. The energy of the planet/deity of \nthe kavacha we chant cannot form a sheath around us easily. It requires \nintense sadhana for most people. If one chants a kavacha 10-30 times \neveryday and does it for 40-60 days, then some kind of results can be \nexpected. Intense sadhana with any mantra is needed for most people to \nsee some results. Getting things done by a professional priest is also \nnot that useful, as there are very very few priests with the required \npurity, the ability to identify with your problem and the ability to \ntransfer the energy. For most people, the best solution is to learn and \nchant by themselves.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn Thu, Jul 7, 2011 at 11:39 AM, monkeymonkeyking10 wrote:\n\nNamaste all,\n\nI sincerely hope our moderator forgives this question which I also \nposted on the jyotish forum...I am a bit unclear about Kavacha for the \nplanets.\n\nFor example, if a planet such as Rahu is giving one to have problems \nduring his dasha, would one recite the Kavach of Rahu, OR some other \n&quot;counter-balancing&quot; planet that was strong in one&#39;s chart?\n\nThanks!\n\nRaj\n\n"}}
