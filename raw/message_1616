One who is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; interested in wealth is a Vaishya. One =\r\nwho is interested in pleasures in a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shoodra (that is why phala sruti=\r\n of Vishnu sahasra naama stotra promises \n&gt; &gt; &gt; these respective results to=\r\n the four varnas - see &quot;vedaantago braahmanah \n&gt; &gt; &gt; syaat...&quot;). Valmiki wa=\r\ns born in a shoodra family, but became a brahmana and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a maharshi lat=\r\ner. Vishwamitra was born in a kshatriya family, but became a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; brahman=\r\na and a maharshi later and many veda hymns were actually revealed to \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n the world through him!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The meaning of saying that only a Brah=\r\nmana can deal with veda is that only a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; person interested in knowledg=\r\ne and spiritual progress (and not money or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; power or pleasures) can l=\r\nearn and teach veda. Others (interested in money, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; power and pleasure=\r\ns) are not qualified for self-realization. It has nothing \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to do with=\r\n the the birth caste.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding women:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Veda is fo=\r\nr self-knowledge. Study and contemplation of Veda is for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; self-realiz=\r\nation. Spiritually speaking, Shiva is the potential energy and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shakt=\r\ni is the kinetic energy. Men are supposed to have more Shiva than \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sh=\r\nakti in them and women are supposed to have more Shakti than Shiva in \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; them. If a man is really like Shiva, he can study and experience Veda and=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; realize self and his wife can realize self through him. That would =\r\nbe a good \n&gt; &gt; &gt; strategy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, men are hardly like Shiva =\r\ntoday. In fact, there is very little \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shiva in anyone and there is mo=\r\nre Shakti (kinetic energy) in women as well \n&gt; &gt; &gt; as men today. Moreover, =\r\nmost men do not do any spiritual sadhana at all. The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rules make no s=\r\nense anymore.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the old days, rishis pursued knowledge and sp=\r\niritual sadhana, while their \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wives ran the houses. The sadhana of ri=\r\nshis was sufficient for them and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; their wives. Today&#39;s men are differ=\r\nent. Whenever I go to a poojas at the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; houses of friends, I see all w=\r\nomen gathering at the pooja and chanting \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mantras, while all men sit =\r\nelsewhere and chat about sports, politics and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; movies. The world is a=\r\n changed place. Women cannot rely on their men to do \n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual sadha=\r\nna for them and they are on their own. Men are not like \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shiva. Rules=\r\n composed long back do not apply anymore.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Upasani maharaj, who=\r\n was worshipped by Shirdi Sai Baba himself as god, was a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; great Vedic=\r\n scholar who taught veda and yajna to women! I respect his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; judgment =\r\nand its relevance today more than the relevance of an ancient \n&gt; &gt; &gt; dharma=\r\n shastra. Universal dharma needs to be redefined from time to time by \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; realized souls. It becomes stale otherwise.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is the prob=\r\nlem with some religions that are based on a written text. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The text m=\r\nay have been good for a specific desa-kaala-paatra, but may have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bec=\r\nome stale now. Fortunately, sanatana dharma (aka Hinduism) does not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ndepend on one specific text. We emphasize sadhana to realize truth rather \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; than adherence to a text. This emphasis on active sadhana ensured a \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; continuous flow of realized souls. We had many realized souls (like \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jnaneshwar Maharaj, Samartha Ramadas, Sai Baba, Ramakrishna Paramaham=\r\nsa, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramana Maharshi etc) from time to time and they refined our unde=\r\nrstanding. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Religions that emphasized adherence to a text rather than=\r\n active sadhana to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; realize truth depended on an old text put togethe=\r\nr by one realized soul and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; they may have become stale now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --=\r\n------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.V=\r\nedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.Ved=\r\nicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ gr=\r\noup/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home=\r\n.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst ro=\r\nloger.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nat=\r\nh.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- =\r\n- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;Jagmohan Nanawar=\r\ne&quot; &lt;jagmohan_nanaware@ ...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, April 07, 2009 1:57 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Women=\r\n reading Vedas (Re: reading/learning the veda)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namast=\r\ne,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Excellent explanation from you Narasimha-ji!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Just have some doubts:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The code of conduct about reciting veda=\r\ns (who can do it) are prescribed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in Manusmriti.

His commentary\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; departs from\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the standard Dwaitic (dualistic) point of view adopted by most\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt; Vaishnava\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; gurus and uses a purely Adwaitic (non-dualistic)=\r\n point of view. It\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; priceless and timeless masterpi=\r\nece.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; One Swamiji who was =\r\nat my house last month had an interesting take.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; He said\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n that the belief that women cannot recite Vedas is based on a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; mi=\r\nsinterpretation. He said that the physical body we have is called\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;stree sareera&quot; and the inner body we have is called the &quot;pu=\r\nrusha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sareera&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; He said that the physical body comes fr=\r\nom mother and the soul comes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; father and that is wh=\r\ny they are called so. The soul or inner self\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; tho=\r\nusand-headed purusha within us (described in purusha sooktam).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; He said that Veda is supposed to be recited with the purusha\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sareera.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; According to him, it does not mean that women cann=\r\not read it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Whether men or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; women, they have to read it =\r\nwith the purusha sareera, i.e. inner\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; body, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; not just=\r\n with the physical body. So, according to him, the standard\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; conv=\r\nention is based on a flawed understanding. According to him,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; one s=\r\nimply\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; reciting Veda with the mouth without the correct internal\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; understanding is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; only reading with the &quot;stree sareera&quot; =\r\nand hence not doing the right\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In fact, reciting Veda and chanting the verses is one =\r\nthing and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; understanding them is quite another. When we make soun=\r\nd, there are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; four\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; levels of it - vaikhari, madhyama, pa=\r\nsyanti and para. Vibration of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; material\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; belonging to the=\r\n gross body (sthoola sareera) produces vaikhari\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; level of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; sound and it is heard through the senses belonging to the gross\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nbody (ears).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; But vibrations at the level of subtle body (sookshm=\r\na sareera) and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; vibrations\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; at the level of astral body (=\r\nkaarana sareera) are also there and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; can be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; perceived th=\r\norough subtle perception.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If one is chanting &quot;Om Namo=\r\n Narayanaya&quot; and thinking of some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mundane\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; matters, the =\r\nvibrations produced at levels above vaikhari will not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; auspicious. There is so much stress on what we do physically and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n people\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; forget that what happens at the other layers of existenc=\r\ne is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; equally, if not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more, important!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; If you produce the correct vibrations at all levels (not just\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n physical)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; while &quot;reciting&quot; any Vedic mantra, you can truly &quot;exp=\r\nerience&quot; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mantra. A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; full experience of a single Vedi=\r\nc mantra may be sufficient to alter\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; life! The man=\r\ntras of Veda are most powerful. Unfortunately, so much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of Vedic\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; scholarship these days is only superficial (but it has to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; encouraged,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; because it will keep atleast one level of knowle=\r\ndge alive).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Forget the man vs woman controversy. The =\r\ndifference between genders\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in the gross body. W=\r\nhen you go to the subtle body and astral body,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; there is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n no difference at all. One should realize that the role of gross\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; b=\r\nody is too\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; limited in the correct recitation/experien ce of a Ve=\r\ndic mantra. It\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; purity of the subtle body and the=\r\n lightness of the astral body that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are far\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more importa=\r\nnt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; To be fair and balanc=\r\ned, I need to throw light on the other angle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Like I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sa=\r\nid, Vedic mantras are too powerful. They are capable of producing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\na full\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; self-realization (actually the sole purpose of Veda is &quot;t=\r\no know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; self&quot;).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; However, given the depth of Kali Yuga, i=\r\nt is difficult for it to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; come in one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; shot. It comes in =\r\nsteps. When one is half way down the path, one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; has to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; careful and under the vigilant guidance of a sadguru.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; When one is not fully realized and the gross body has a role to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n play, there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are some differences based on the gender that come =\r\ninto play.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If a lady carrying a baby in her womb has =\r\ncertain spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; experiences\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (which a good Vedic chant=\r\ning is capable of bringing), there can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; even be an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; abort=\r\nion (or a great siddha being born, on the other extreme).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; There is another subtle factor. Good Vedic chanting can bring an\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; awakening\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of Kundalini (i.e. an awakening of self-awareness)=\r\n and an ascent of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Kundalini (i.e. an ascent of self-awareness) .=\r\n Though some people\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; may have a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; wrong impression about K=\r\nundalini because of the corrupt practices\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; section =\r\nof so-called &quot;Kundalini sadhakas&quot;, the fact is that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Kundalini mere=\r\nly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; represents one&#39;s ego-consciousness. When one casually associa=\r\ntes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the body\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; one sees with &quot;self&quot;, Kundalini is asleep =\r\nin the Mooladhara chakra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; As one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; self-awareness becom=\r\nes more and more refined, Kundalini ascends in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sook=\r\nshma sareera. As one has a perfect self-realization, Kundalini\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; rea=\r\nches\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sahasrara. Whether one thinks in these terms or not, Kundal=\r\nini\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; moves based\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; on how evolved one is. Whether one is i=\r\nnto Bhakti yoga or Raja yoga\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; or Karma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; yoga or Jnana yog=\r\na does not matter. All paths lead to an awareness\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of a more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and more correct concept of self as time progresses and a full\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; self-realization finally. Accordingly, Kundalini rises more and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; more and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; reaches Sahasrara at the end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; D=\r\nuring the period when Kundalini is stuck in Swadhishthana chakra,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nsexual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; drive can multiply. Several yogis get stuck in this stage=\r\n and fail\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the tests\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to progress further. In general, wo=\r\nmen have a higher drive than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; men. If that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; drive multipl=\r\nies, there can be a difficult situation. However, it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; really\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; depends on the individual and we cannot generalize.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; Thus, there are some practical difficulties on the way, which may\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; have made\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; some people come up with some rules. However, are =\r\nthose issues\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sufficient to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ban women from reciting Veda=\r\n? I don&#39;t think so. In fact, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; factors I wrote\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; above =\r\nare probably irrelevant given the superficial understanding\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of Ved=\r\na\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; present at this time and the superficial recitation of Veda th=\r\nat we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; find\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; these days.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; But, if yo=\r\nu want to be sure and do not want to misguide anyone, it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is better=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to not give any advice. Leave it to one&#39;s sadguru. If you have =\r\na\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sadguru who\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is guiding your spiritual sadhana, surren=\r\nder and do as your guru\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; says! What\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is good for goose ma=\r\ny not be good for gander. What goose&#39;s guru\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; taught to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; g=\r\noose may be good only for goose and not for gander. Gander will do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n well to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; follow gander&#39;s guru.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I think I r=\r\nambled enough for today... :-)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Homam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAst rologe=\r\nr.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home=\r\n.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicA=\r\nst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.Sr=\r\niJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; From: &quot;rohinipurang&quot; &lt;rohinipurang@ &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ ya=\r\nhoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sent: Saturday, February 24, 2007 12:18 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] reading/learning the veda\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;A warm namaste to everyone!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I have=\r\n heard it said that women are not allowed to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; read/know/recite the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; vedas.
