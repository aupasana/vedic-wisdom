Do you know him as a friend and =\r\nis he a Indian? What sort of path/sadhana is he following?? Is he a sannyas=\r\nin or a householder ?Did specific changes happened in his life after=C2=A0 =\r\nhe had these samadhi and visions.Any other special things about him.\n=C2=A0=\r\n\n=C2=A0\nYes he is a friend of mine.=C2=A0 I can only tell you very little a=\r\nbout his spiritual life, because he hardly ever shares it with anyone. He i=\r\ns married, lives in Delhi and has a son as well.\n=C2=A0\nBefore I tell you a=\r\nnything more=C2=A0about his spiritual life=C2=A0that I know, let me say=C2=\r\n=A0line or two about the nature of this friend of mine. I met him about two=\r\n years back. What first attracted me to=C2=A0 towards him was his impeccabl=\r\ne honestly. I mean, he is a maniac=C2=A0when it comes to=C2=A0honestly.=C2=\r\n=A0If someone were to put a gun to his head and ask him to just say a simpl=\r\ne, harmless=C2=A0lie, like sun rises in the west, he would not say it. Ther=\r\nefore he never jokes with anyone too! He has actually never ever=C2=A0spoke=\r\nn even a single lie in his whole life, big or small. When he was in his sch=\r\nool, once his teacher told him that Indian languages are richer than Englis=\r\nh, he believed his teacher. Later someone else told him English is more com=\r\nprehensive language and the world cannot do with it. He got confused. Since=\r\n that day, he bought himself two thick fat dictionaries, one English, one H=\r\nindi and for ten years every day he spend one hour reading the English dict=\r\nionary and\n one hour reading the Hindi dictionary apart from reading=C2=A0u=\r\np volumes of Hindi and English literature.=C2=A0When I asked him why, he ju=\r\nst said it is because he wanted to be=C2=A0equally adept at both the langua=\r\nges so that one day he can take a really detached view to judge the truth a=\r\nbout=C2=A0which is more comprehensive language! As I said, he has an uncomp=\r\nromising attitude when it comes to finding out the truth about anything. By=\r\n education, he is a Phd is mathematics. He has worked in different fields, =\r\nfrom banking to education to journalism. He did not last for long in most p=\r\nlaces. He speaks and writes fluently, English, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskr=\r\nit, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he is learning Tamil. He composes poetry i=\r\nn all the above languages. When he was in college, he considered himself an=\r\n atheist. While applying for a job he had kept the place makered for religi=\r\non as blank. When the clerk who was supposed to take the forms saw that bla=\r\nnk space, he asked\n my friend&#39;s name. Hearing a Hindu name, the clerk wrote=\r\n &quot;Hindu&quot;. Seeing this, my friend snatched the form from the clerk and tore =\r\nit up right there. Because, he considered himself an atheist and writing Hi=\r\nndu in the form would have been a lie. \n=C2=A0\nSo this gives a basic idea o=\r\nf the man I am speaking of. All his friends, whoever knows him, calls him R=\r\nama of Kaliyuga.\n=C2=A0\nOne day, long back, he was going to office for some=\r\n urgent meeting. His way to office passed by a Krishna temple. As he was pa=\r\nssing by in=C2=A0his scooter, suddenly he felt a strange urge to go into th=\r\ne temple. He says he still does not know why he went inside the temple, but=\r\n he did. That was at 9 o clock in the morning. Next when he sees his watch =\r\nit is 4:30 in the evening! And he has no knowledge of how the time went. Wh=\r\nen he asked the priest, the priest said that he went into the temple sat do=\r\nwn and just stayed as he was for the whole time without any movement. The p=\r\nriest somehow felt scared to disturb him. But my friend had no idea why thi=\r\ns happened. He remembered nothing, as if he was in deep sleep.\n=C2=A0\nThen =\r\nhe started meditating at home, and it was there=C2=A0that he got visions et=\r\nc of Krishna. He does not say much about these, infact most people who know=\r\n him also do not know these things. But once he was in samadhi for 72 hours=\r\n, not moving from his meditation seat, in the exact same place and same pos=\r\nition for 3 days continuously.=C2=A0Only his wife and close relatives know =\r\nabout this incident. I believe nowadays when ever he sits for meditation he=\r\n often enters the state of Samadhi. When someone asked him how he felt duri=\r\nng samadhi, he just said it feels as if the whole universe orginates from m=\r\ne. I am the sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, the animals, men, women,=\r\n children, the wind, the water, the space, smaller than the atom and bigger=\r\n than everything. It cannot be accurately desribed.=C2=A0He considers Sri K=\r\nrishna to be God and=C2=A0Lord Rama to be the ideal man.That is why he does=\r\n not like the Ramacharit Manas because he thinks it elevated Sri=C2=A0Rama =\r\nto the\n level of a God whereas the aim of the orginal Valmiki Ramayana was =\r\nto show Sri Rama as an ideal man,=C2=A0not a God.The difference he says is =\r\nthat, an ideal man is someone who can be emulated, an ordinary man can and =\r\nshould aim to become like the ideal. But a God cannot be emulated by ordina=\r\nry men. One cannot become Krishna, but one=C2=A0can try to lead his life li=\r\nke Rama. I have argued with him over this, but I am merely stating his idea=\r\n. Also he does not have a Guru - a human guru at least, and advises people =\r\nto not trust most Gurus these days. Needless to say, he is not an atheist a=\r\nny more.\n=C2=A0\nLater he had once=C2=A0mentioned he knew the relation he ha=\r\nd with all the people around him in his past lives. His mother he says, was=\r\n his daughter in his past life etc. Nowadays he spends a lot of time on dif=\r\nferent internet forums interacting with people, specially=C2=A0with those i=\r\nn=C2=A0the age group of 18 to 30, discussing anything and everything with t=\r\nhem, from Indian politics to Indian history, religion, etc etc. His idea is=\r\n to impart right knowledge to young people who will be the future of this c=\r\nountry.\n=C2=A0\nHe is am omnivorous person. Like any other Bengali, eats fis=\r\nh, meat etc.\n=C2=A0\nI shall refrain from mentioning his name because I had =\r\nnot asked his permission before mentioning him.\n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajar=\r\nshi\n\n\nPS: I would not like this mail to be considered as a part of the deba=\r\nte.

Is he a sannyasin o=\r\nr a householder ?Did specific changes happened in his life after&nbsp; he h=\r\nad these samadhi and visions.Any other special things about him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In =\r\nthe Gita Lord is saying whatever you do/eat offer it to me first. So he is =\r\noffering all these non-veg to Lord with devotion, Right?? Then prasdam all =\r\naround??&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My curious questions are not against your acceptance of his=\r\n exexperienceut to learn more.After all he is\n part of hidden violence. Som=\r\nebody is inflicting gruesome&nbsp; pain and misery on animals and birds on =\r\nhis behalf and he is consuming them and yet he is experiencing all these ex=\r\notic&nbsp; visions, But no feeling of kindness towards birds and animals.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Where did I go wrong? Simple dal/roti and do not even touch onion/gar=\r\nlic/ pepper but no such samadhi? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When we get burnt, we need to be c=\r\nareful.Many years ago I saw in a book/article&nbsp; about Dayamata who succ=\r\neded&nbsp; Paramhansa Yoganand. Once she went to India and told a Spiritual=\r\n Master that her progress has stopped. Master said, you are eating eggs whi=\r\nch she admitted that she was doing&nbsp; secretly.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is very comp=\r\nlex world. No outright solutions for so many difficult questions. Followers=\r\n of 3 faiths which all originated in middle east are fighting each other al=\r\nl the time. Sometimes I think, from which part of Spiritual Sky these energ=\r\nies are coming,Are they also enemies\n there?? Their Gods said in their holy=\r\n books that animals are their food. So they cannot even think about souls i=\r\nn animals or their pain and emotions.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Then I have read stories about=\r\n several people, who follow these faiths and are non-veg and how they exexp=\r\nerience&nbsp; spiritual highs and other such phenomena. It is so difficult =\r\nto comprehend.&nbsp; Would they remain in the cycle of b/d&nbsp; till they =\r\nlearn about kindness???&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Kind Regards&lt;BR&gt;LaxmiNarayan&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;--- On Sat, 12/12/09, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@yahoo. co.in&gt; wr=\r\note:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n      &lt;!--1--&gt;=\r\n&lt;hr size=3D1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; \nThe INTERNET now has a personality.
