I have browsed several posts here and I do not know of =\r\nany \n&gt; reference in any traditional shastras, so I have a question regardin=\r\ng the \n&gt; performance of homam in one&#39;s mind. There must be times in one&#39;s l=\r\nife when \n&gt; several restrictions of time or place or any other reasons - do=\r\n not allow one to \n&gt; perform an external homam under the &quot;perfect&quot; conditio=\r\nns that one would like. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 1. So how does one go about this? Does one=\r\n mentally visualize oneself performing \n&gt; all the external rituals from A-Z=\r\n? What if one&#39;s mind cannot &quot;multi-task&quot; and \n&gt; synchronize the mental reci=\r\ntation of mantras with the mental performance of \n&gt; actions? What if one ca=\r\nnnot maintain the same standards of external environment \n&gt; purity, discipl=\r\nine etc? Is it then best to avoid mental homam altogether?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Can one =\r\nderive the same benefit from a mental homam that one would derive \n&gt; from a=\r\nn external homam?\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. Could a regular performance of mental homam remov=\r\ne the impediments that is \n&gt; blocking one in doing homam in real life and m=\r\nay it result in one becoming \n&gt; fortunate enough to carry out real-life hom=\r\nam by the grace of God?\n&gt; \n&gt; Many many Thanks\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
