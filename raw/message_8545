The passion for external renunciation is like a bolt of lightning. It=\r\n may strike at any time. It is not a reasoned choice. But why not renounce =\r\nall sense of limitation, even the limitation of monastic forms? Why not enj=\r\noy all possible dimensions of human experience as already merged in God? Ca=\r\nn one get completely inebriated on just a few pennies&#39; worth of wine? Fill =\r\nup the whole pitcher!&quot;\n\nThis radical response surprises the questioner, who=\r\n had already tacitly assumed a traditional, pious answer. He gazed, speechl=\r\ness, at the laughing sage, and then asks with astonishment: &quot;A spiritual pr=\r\nactitioner should lead a worldly life?&quot;\n\nRamakrishna: &quot;Why not? What is the=\r\nre to fear or avoid when Divine Reality is know to be all-embracing=85 Rela=\r\ntively few persons have the destiny to drop social and personal connections=\r\n entirely in order to enter the external state of sannyasa - wandering aiml=\r\nessly in the ecstasy of knowledge and love, taking no direct responsibility=\r\n for educating or serving society in pragmatic ways.&quot;\n\nVisitor: &quot;Master, wh=\r\nat does it mean to say that a person has reached the end of worldly enjoyme=\r\nnts?&quot;\n\nRamakrishna: &quot;=85To come to the end of worldly enjoyments is to EXPE=\r\nRIENCE Divine Bliss flowing through EVERY ACTION, EVERY PERCEPTION.&quot;\n\nVisit=\r\nor: &quot;How can I get rid of sexual passion?&quot;\n\nRamakrishna: &quot;Why get rid of it=\r\n? Turn its powerful energy in another direction. Lust is blind, but the Gre=\r\nat Delight conferred by the Goddess is ever-pure and resplendent.&quot;\n\nThe new=\r\n questioner is also disconcerted by such a radical response delivered with =\r\nsuch wonderful laughter. This seeker has been conditioned by the teaching t=\r\nhat cultivates liberation by categorically rejecting what ever appears as i=\r\ngnorance, limitation, or bondage. Intrigued by the relaxed, all-embracing t=\r\nantric attitude of the Goddess-worshiping sage, drawn deep into inquiry by =\r\nthis magnet of Divine Mother&#39;s Knowledge and Love, this visible form of the=\r\n dancing Kali-the seeker cries in consternation: &quot;Please, most revered Mast=\r\ner, why would a benign Deity project the power of ignorance and limitation?=\r\n&quot;\n\nRamakrishna melts into laughter, his eyes swimming in ecstasy, his body,=\r\n like burnished gold, glowing with heavenly light. This response emanates d=\r\nirectly from Mother Mahamaya, beyond reason, religion, philosophy. Now our =\r\nMaster is weeping tears of pure love: &quot;It is ALL Her Play, Her delirious Pl=\r\nay. OM KALI, OM KALI, OM KALI!&quot;\n\nVisitor: &quot;Beloved Paramahamsa, who is real=\r\nly to blame for sexual obsession and its bondage? Men or women?&quot;\n\nRamakrish=\r\nna: &quot;You are male, so I will speak to you about women. To women, I give the=\r\n same teachings about the spiritual danger and the spiritual potential of m=\r\nen. A women who has awakened in her body and mind the energy of transcenden=\r\nt wisdom, which is the brilliant healing and enlightening presence of the G=\r\noddess, can be a tremendous blessing for a male practitioner - as a tantric=\r\n consort, as consecrated wife, or simply as the inspiring friend of his sou=\r\nl. But a woman who has developed exclusively her biological and social driv=\r\nes is filled with a subtle energy that can be detrimental to the progress o=\r\nf a male aspirant. Eventually - without either person recognizing any dange=\r\nr-she can stifle his aspiration by drowning him in the forces of the limite=\r\nd ego world. Precisely the same facts must be explained to women concerning=\r\n men...The brilliant feminine energy of wisdom, which incarnates through th=\r\ne bodies and minds of both men and women, cultivates the refined taste for =\r\nsweet spiritual companionship, for knowledge of oneness, for tears of pure =\r\nlove, for ecstatic union with various revealed forms of Divinity, and for r=\r\nefreshing renunciation of all deceptive, habitual expectations. By contrast=\r\n, the energy of limitation consists of the random, compulsive play of the m=\r\nind and senses with their objects - an instinctual drive for experience tha=\r\nt lacks both subtlety and harmony and causes the heart to forget the deligh=\r\nt of Divine Reality, the communion that is natural to the human soul. But, =\r\nboth currents - the energy of wisdom and the energy of limitation - are sim=\r\nply Mother&#39;s Energy. When only God exists, who is there to praise and whom =\r\nto blame?&quot; (7)\n\nCopied from Lex Hixon&#39;s book, Great Swan: Meetings with Ram=\r\nakrishna.\n\n\n"}}
