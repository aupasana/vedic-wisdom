Srinivasan while searchin=\r\ng online. I purchased his books on Krishna and Durga puja recently and was =\r\nquite happy with the straightforward instructions and explanation of variou=\r\ns mantras. \n\nOverall I have a good impression of his books and would reccom=\r\nend them to anyone who wants to learn how to do a simple yet complete puja.=\r\n I actually downloaded them via the itunes store and literally read off my =\r\nipad as I haven&#39;t memorised all the mantras yet- this works quite well. \n\nT=\r\nhis site contains an extract of the Krishna puja book \nhttp://www.hindubook=\r\ns.org/religious/pujatokrishna/index.html\n\nIf anyone has recommendations for=\r\n other books, or websites on puja at home, please let me know. \n\nHope the n=\r\new year has started well everybody. Hope 2013 brings spirtual progress to e=\r\nach one of us. Personally, I&#39;m going to try and make this a year of action =\r\ni.e. spending more time doing homam/japa/puja and less time reading spiritu=\r\nal books (though this is also important). \n\nBest wishes,\n\nAparna \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
