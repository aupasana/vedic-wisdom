That is more appr=\r\nopriate for the times we live in.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; People of old times had bright=\r\nly burning bhootaagni inside. Their performance of a daily fire ritual was =\r\njust a responsibility towards the universe. They were doing fire ritual for=\r\n maintaining dharma in the universe and not necessarily for saving their ow=\r\nn bhootaagni from being extinguished.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Most people today - even t=\r\nhose who are re-incarnations of very good yogis=C2=A0from the last life - a=\r\nre initially lacking in internal purity and their bhootaagni is very very v=\r\nery weak and actually pretty much extinguished in most people. The times ar=\r\ne such, the culture is such, our lifestyles are such, the influences on our=\r\n minds are such and the energy filling the air we breath is such. Thus, one=\r\n&#39;s reason for doing a homam is different from the old times. When one does =\r\na fire ritual,=C2=A0one does one&#39;s dharma towards the universe and, at the =\r\nsame time, improves one&#39;s own internal bhootaagni a little bit.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\nFor doing any spiritual activity - japam or tarpana or just reading a scrip=\r\nture or contemplation - strong bhootaagni is very important for internalizi=\r\nng and digesting the experience spiritually. If a person with a very weak o=\r\nr extinguished bhootaagni does such spiritual activities, the impact is neg=\r\nligible. As a person&#39;s bhootaagni is maximized immediately following a ritu=\r\nal with an external fire, it helps one do a better job with other spiritual=\r\n activities.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Thus, my recommendation is the same as Narayan&#39;s. D=\r\no homam, meditate as the poornaahuti burns and then do tarpana. In fact, if=\r\n you are only doing deva and rishi tarpanas, you can even integrate it with=\r\n homam. You can do deva and rishi tarpanas while sitting in front of the fi=\r\nre, after the uttaraangam and before the poornaahuti, and then go on to off=\r\ner poornaahuti. However, if you also want to include pitris (deceased ances=\r\ntors) along with devas and rishis, I suggest doing it separately after the =\r\nhomam.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I want to narrate an incident r=\r\nelated to tarpana manuals.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Manish thinks very highly of tarpana =\r\nand asked me to create a manual for it last year. In the case of homam, I s=\r\ntudied and practiced several approaches and experienced some things interna=\r\nlly and knew what I was talking about, before the homam manuals were create=\r\nd. In case of tarpana, my experience and internal understanding was limited=\r\n when I created the manuals. Though I had Manish&#39;s blessings, I had some do=\r\nubts=C2=A0on whether what I consolidated (as 3 options) was good enough or =\r\nnot. On the day chosen for making the manuals available, I did my Chandi ho=\r\nmam in the morning and prayed to the 18-handed Mahalakshmi/ Durga idol I us=\r\ne for homam, &quot;O Mother, I was very comfortable with homam manuals, but my e=\r\nxperience in tarpana is limited. But Manish asked me to create and distribu=\r\nte tarpana manuals. Several important people may be using these manuals in =\r\nfuture. If what I consolidated is good and you approve it, please give me s=\r\nome signal today as I perform the\n&gt;  procedure. I will understand. I will p=\r\nublish them only if you give your approval.&quot;\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Then I sat down to =\r\nperform tarpanas. The moment I invoked gods and rishis into the kalasha, th=\r\nere was such a powerful wind outside (the windows were open). The sound of =\r\nthe wind was really loud. I started deva tarpana and said &quot;brahmaa tripyata=\r\nam&quot; and left water. Then I took water into my palm again and said &quot;vishnuh =\r\ntripyataam&quot;. As soon as I left that water, I heard big thup-thup sounds fro=\r\nm outside. When I lifted my head to see through the window, I saw that heav=\r\ny rain with really big drops had just started. It did not rain in the previ=\r\nous 10 days and there were no noticeable clouds in the sky that morning. It=\r\n was very sunny and bright until then. But a heavy rain started as soon as =\r\ntarpana started and the rain continued till the end of the day.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\nI took the wind and the rain as signals of approval from the Mother, thanke=\r\nd her at the end=C2=A0and went ahead to publish the manuals. As I performed=\r\n the ritual more times later, I slowly understood the real meaning and purp=\r\nose of tarpana. For many people with weak minds that are afflicted by rinas=\r\n to deceased ancestors with mental weaknesses, tarpana is a very very usefu=\r\nl ritual. I now fully understand why Manish, or Vimalananda for that matter=\r\n, emphasized performing both homam and tarpana and how they supplement each=\r\n other. I am glad that more people are considering performing a quick homam=\r\n and a quick tarpana on a regular basis. Even a combination of=C2=A0a 30-mi=\r\nnute homam and a 5-minute tarpana performed daily will go a long way in fre=\r\neing one.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- ---------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself:=\r\n http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http:=\r\n//www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.co=\r\nm/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. hom=\r\ne.comcast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rolog=\r\ner.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt;=\r\n ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: krishna Kanth \n&gt; To: vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@ yahoogroups. com \n&gt; Sent: Thursday, August 27, 2009 10:19 AM\n&gt; Subjec=\r\nt: [vedic-wisdom] Query regarding Homam / Tarpanam\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Sri Nar=\r\nasimha Garu,\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Namaskaram.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; If one has to do both Homam =\r\nand Tarpanam daily, what would be your suggestion in terms of which would b=\r\ne the order one has to perform both.. is it that first do homam and then Ta=\r\nrpanam or vice versa or it does=C2=A0 not matter?\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I have downloa=\r\nded the all tarpana manuals from the website and thinking to start off with=\r\n super short process from the coming poornima day.
