One&#39;s experiences =\r\nand actions are due to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the momentum set in motion by previously prese=\r\nnt conditioning. One\n&gt; &gt; &gt; engages in them with no agendas, likes, dislikes=\r\n, and attachments. Thus,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a jeevanmukta operates the previous identity=\r\n till the momentum comes to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a screeching halt and then the body, sens=\r\nes, sensory mind, buddhi etc\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are returned to the original sources fro=\r\nm which they were borrowed and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; made sentient. But a jeevanmukta is fr=\r\nee and unbound even while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; operating with an identity, for binding com=\r\nes from the conditioning and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not from identification or actions. When=\r\n the identity dissolves, it is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not any better or any extra freedom.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Most likely, a jeevanmukta ceases to operate an identity after s=\r\nome\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time, that time depending on the strength of prior momentum! It c=\r\nan be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; days or months or years or centuries or millennia.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nNature sets such powerful momentum in place for some beings (e.g.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sap=\r\ntarshis, Vishnu, Shiva etc) that they may operate an identity for a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; v=\r\nery long time after conditioning drops off completely. It may even be\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n for the entire duration of Creation. As a part of the momentum set in\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; motion previously, one may even direct a part of one&#39;s ahamkara to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nidentify with a newly created identity (e.g. a new incarnation).

All that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comes from cond=\r\nitioning in chitta, which is absent now!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The unconditioned identifi=\r\ner (liberated I-ness) views what one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; identifies with as an *amalgam=\r\n* of portions borrowed from various\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deities (pancha mahabhootas, Mo=\r\non, Mercury, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; etc) and hence as a manifes=\r\ntation of Light itself. One does not view\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it from the prism of &quot;thi=\r\ns is me, I need to use it to pursue X or Y\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; agenda.&quot; One views it as=\r\n &quot;this is me. I am made of portions borrowed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from various deities, =\r\ni.e. various manifestations of Light. I observe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their play, i.e. wh=\r\nat they do, and I have no agenda pursue using\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This i=\r\ns the essence of Upanishads and Yoga Vaasishtham, as well as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mantra=\r\n Pushpam that we were discussing a while back.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I repeat, identifica=\r\ntion is not the problem. It is the conditioning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that drives how one=\r\n uses what one identifies with, that is the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problem.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *=C2=\r\n=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 *=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I now feel =\r\nlike I have expressed myself better, though, given how\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; subtle and n=\r\nuanced this knowledge is, some people may still get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confused (if so=\r\n, please don&#39;t worry. Not a big deal. Just keep doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana, for =\r\nthat&#39;s the most important thing!). I am grateful to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Manish and Maha=\r\nrshi Vasishtha for giving me this opportunity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, whether Ramakri=\r\nshna really got throat cancer because of his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;insult&quot; of Trilinga S=\r\nwami or because he took the kaarmik power of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attorney from Girish (=\r\na drunkard and womanizer at the time) can be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; debated. Strictly spea=\r\nking, whether Ramakrishna really became a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; jeevanmukta in that lifet=\r\nime or not can also be debated. But those are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not really useful deb=\r\nates.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Happy MahaShivaRatri again!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Krishnarpanamastu, Narasi=\r\nmha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------=C2=\r\n=A0 =C2=A0 Free\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Wri=\r\ntings, &quot;Do It\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Ta=\r\nrpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.o=\r\nrg/&gt; &lt;\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;http://sa=\r\nraswatifilms.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org &lt;http://saraswatifilm=\r\ns.org/&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisd=\r\nom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Jyotis=\r\nh writings:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Twitter ID: @homam10=\r\n8\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; On Sun, Feb 19, 2012 at 2:20 AM, Manish Pandit wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Shree R=\r\nama Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That was not the question. The question was as =\r\nI asked it. Why did\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna get the affliction (my question pre=\r\nsumes, that he got it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as a result of that insult) If his mind did n=\r\not identify with his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; body, 24/7,But instead with Atma, then the kar=\r\nma would not have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; afflicted him, as there was no identification, so=\r\n no karma (like\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Krishna) If it did afflict that body, then it is ob=\r\nvious that there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was good enough identification of mind with body, =\r\nthat he could not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; escape the karmic result. That is the point. Not =\r\nthat he was oblivious\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the suffering. And, we say that he was a J=\r\neevanmukta. So how can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that happen, if according to that definition=\r\n, the mind must be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; identifying 24/7 with Atma to be qualified as a =\r\nJeevanmukta?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The answer is straight forward. I await your reply.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kindest regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Sunday, February 19, 2012, Narasimha PVR R=\r\nao &lt; pvr@\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;javascript:parent.wgMail.openComposeWindow(&#39;pvr@&#39;)&gt; &gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Namaste, As twitter is too restrictive a medium, I want to an=\r\nswer a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; question that came up in an exchange between my guru Manish=\r\n and me on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Twitter, here. Some portions of the Twitter exchange ar=\r\ne quoted at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the end, in chronological order, in case someone is in=\r\nterested in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; background. I will answer the following question p=\r\nosed by Manish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; based on my understanding: &lt;&lt;&lt;The question to my mi=\r\nnd is this: was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Ramakrishna a Jeevanmukta? If so, Why did he suffe=\r\nr with throat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; cancer if he was not identifying with his actions? (=\r\naccording to your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; interpretation of Vasistha&#39;s definition??)&gt;&gt;&gt; * =\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A * =C3=83=E2=80=9A\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n =C3=83=E2=80=9A * Let me elaborate on my understanding of jeevanmukti. Man=\r\nish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; loosely (in my view) said in this exchange that rinas are of b=\r\nody and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; a jeevanmukta continues to fulfil those rinas. But body is=\r\n an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; insentient object. It has no rinas. The rinas are not of the b=\r\nody,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; but of the mind that identifies with it. It is the antahkaran=\r\nas of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mind - ahamkara (I-ness) and chitta (memory/conditioning) - =\r\nthat are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the source of various rinas, particularly chitta. As mind=\r\n identifies\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with a body, it projects its rinas on the body and mak=\r\nes the body\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;do&quot; things, in accordance with those=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; rinas/conditioning. If the conditioning in chitta is completely w=\r\niped\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; out and ahamkara merges in Self, then it is mukti. But, if th=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta is completely wiped out and yet ahamkara\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; continues to exist with no limiting notions (it is basically the\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta that is limiting), then one becomes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n jeevanmukta (liberated while living). Unlike in the case of one who\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; leaves body and gets mukti, a jeevanmukta continues to have an I-ness\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (but which is not limited by any notions or conditioning). This\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; unconditioned I-ness does project into a body. But it does not say &quot;I\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; am this body and hence this body should be kept healthy or strong&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (THAT would be conditioning in chitta, which is wiped out now!). =\r\nOn\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the other hand, it does not either say &quot;this body should be ign=\r\nored\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and destroyed&quot;. Though conditioning is absent now, body keeps=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; experiencing and doing things based on the *momentum* set in moti=\r\non\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; before one became jeevanmukta and engaged in conditioned experi=\r\nences\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and actions. This is like a fan turning for a while after th=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; electricity has been stopped. Manas, buddhi and indriyas keep wo=\r\nrking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; as they did before. If one has throat cancer, indriyas may s=\r\nense\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; pain. Manas (sensory/motor mind) may process that input and r=\r\negister\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; pain. Buddhi may analyze various observations and draw var=\r\nious\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conclusions (e.g. &quot;when I gulp or try to swallow food, it hur=\r\nts even\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; more&quot;, &quot;when I take so and so herbal liquid, it feels bett=\r\ner&quot; etc). A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; normal person whose conditioned mind (chitta) says &quot;I =\r\nshould overcome\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and not have this pain&quot; may think of various thing=\r\ns to do and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; struggle with them. But an unconditioned being has no =\r\nsuch\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; considerations. Though one may feel and express the pain and =\r\nother\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; objective experiences, one reacts to it differently. * =C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A\n&gt; &gt; * =C3=83=E2=80=9A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=\r\n=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A * This is a key point: Manas and buddhi are good at mak=\r\ning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; objective observations and rational deductions, but, by themse=\r\nlves,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; they do not have ANY agenda. They neither like something nor=\r\n dislike\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; something. THAT comes from the conditioning in chitta! Th=\r\ne hallmark\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of a jeevanmukta is that THAT is absent! * =C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A * =C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Whether Ramakrishna was a jeevanmukta is a moot question. A =\r\nbetter\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; way to express your question is: Can a jeevanmukta get thro=\r\nat cancer\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and feel pain? How is it possible if there are no karmas=\r\n or rinas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; left? I have already answered it. But, let me sum it up =\r\nbriefly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; again. Body, various body parts, jnanendriyas, karmendiyas=\r\n, manas and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; buddhi of a jeevanmukta continue to operate as before.=\r\n One&#39;s I-ness\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is intact and does project itself onto those. But ne=\r\nither I-ness nor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; those things carry any rinas or karmas. Chitta - =\r\nthe repository of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning and rinas - is clean. There are no =\r\nlimiting notions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; One&#39;s body, indriyas, manas & buddhi keep experi=\r\nencing and doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; things (good or bad!) based on the previous momen=\r\ntum set by the play\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of rnas and karmas while some conditioning was=\r\n left in chitta. Body,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; various body parts, indriyas of jnana and k=\r\narma and manas are all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; portions borrowed from various deities. Aha=\r\nmkara (I-ness) infuses\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sentience into them by projecting awareness=\r\n into them. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta is what drives how all thes=\r\ne are viewed and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; used. Instead of looking at a sense organ as a po=\r\nrtion of Indra or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Mitra, one views it as &quot;my so and so sense organ=\r\n&quot;, due to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta. That is what creates karmas and =\r\nrinas. When\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that conditioning is *completely* overcome, ahamkara c=\r\nan still\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; project awareness into those objects, but it sees them fo=\r\nr what they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are. It does not have false and limiting notions like =\r\n&quot;this throat is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mine and MUST feel nice and not feel painful&quot;. * =\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A * =C3=83=E2=80=9A\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n =C3=83=E2=80=9A * Most people who may claim to be (or think they are) jeev=\r\nanmuktas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are not really jeevanmuktas in today&#39;s world. If one want=\r\ns to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; understand the state of jeevanmukti, Yoga Vaasishtham is the =\r\nbest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; book. The entire discourse by Maharshi Vasishtha to Lord Rama=\r\n is a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; detailed and elaborate definition and characterization of a\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta. There may be other books that explain better how to d=\r\no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; various sadhanas to progress spiritually and get closer to being=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; liberated oneday. But, when it comes elaborating what liberation\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; while living actually is, there is none better than Yoga Vaasishth=\r\nam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, one can say that this is merely an intellectual exe=\r\nrcise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; as far as *we* are concerned. It perhaps is, as none of may =\r\never\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; become a jeevanmukta.. One word of caution: I write with a ve=\r\nry\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; confident tone when I have strong conviction in what I write. T=\r\nhat is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; how I am. But I can definitely be wrong. So please feel fre=\r\ne to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ignore me! :-) Happy Shivaratri (tomorrow night) to all!

Nothing really, fulfilling all rnas, wait for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; rnas t=\r\no be over. Narasimha: If a &quot;jeevanmukta&quot; fails in &quot;fulfilling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; all =\r\nrnas&quot;, will he b bound again? If no, y r they called rnas? If\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; yes,=\r\n y call him mukta? Manish: No, rnas will work out themselves,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; slow=\r\nly or fast as may be the case. The rnas are of the body he or she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\noccupies. He is mukta because he experiences, actually sees the rnas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; to be the body&#39;s only. Rnas apply to the body, not to you. You are\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; that &quot;speck of effulgent light&quot;, call it what you want, Atma, etc.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: Well, that speck of effulgent light was never bound. So,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; who exactly bcame &quot;mukta&quot;? Did & does he/it have rnas? If these &quot;rna=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of body&quot; r somehow not fulfilled after one bcomes jeevanmukta, w=\r\nhat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; happens to one? :-) Manish: You are right. The mind thought, t=\r\nhat, it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; was the body, instead of this light. That is the original =\r\nproblem.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Which every being is born with. Rnas arise from this iden=\r\ntification\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; which creates karma. U r not that, so u r not bound, wh=\r\nen the mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; realises this. Became &quot;Mukta&quot; is also not quite true, =\r\nsince u r that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Light&quot; frm d beginning Narasimha: Then, r the rnas=\r\n of the &quot;body&quot; as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; u said r of the mind? When a mind identifies wit=\r\nh light & bcomes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mukta, does it hv rnas left? Manish: Ok, karmas p=\r\nrojected into mind,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are acted on and may be experienced by body. S=\r\no, why is a jeevanmukta\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; subject to this? because, that person alth=\r\nough aware of the light at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; all times, and of the causal n subtle b=\r\nodies, has not yet directed d\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mind to identify as that light at al=\r\nl times, key word being &quot;all&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; This gives karmas time to work. Nex=\r\nt stage is 24/7 id with light\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: As per my understanding, =\r\nthe person u r defining is not a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta. He may b an elevated=\r\n being, but not mukta (liberated)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; yet. Manish: I derive that defin=\r\nition of this &quot;state&quot; from somebody,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; no problem in disagreement. 2=\r\n4/7 identification with light, most\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; likely body should not exist, =\r\nno? Narasimha: Id with light forever\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with body dropping off is jus=\r\nt mukti, not jivanmukti! Jivanmukti is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; where body stays. Is body r=\r\neally different from light? In fact, is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; there anything other than =\r\nlight? Jivanmukti is seeing the play of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; objects but seeing all as =\r\nlight. Mukti & rna are contradictory\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; concepts & cant coexist. U rn=\r\nt &quot;free&quot; till u pay back what u owe. And\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that means u dont owe any=\r\nbody anything once u r truly free. Words\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; like free, liberated & ji=\r\nvanmukta r often misused. Manish: Will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; explain a bit in detail som=\r\netime. Narasimha: OK. :-) But, as far as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;explaining&quot; is concerned=\r\n, Vasishtha explained as clearly &\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; elaborately as any human being =\r\ncan ever hope 2. Manish: The question\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to my mind is this: was Rama=\r\nkrishna a Jeevanmukta? If so, Why did he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; suffer with throat cancer=\r\n if he was not identifying with his actions?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (according to your in=\r\nterpretation of Vasistha&#39;s definition??)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: Vasishtha didn=\r\nt give a single definition. His entire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; discourse 2 Rama is a defin=\r\nition of jeevanmukta!

Thus,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; a jeevanmukta operates the previous identity t=\r\nill the momentum comes to&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; a screeching halt and then the =\r\nbody, senses, sensory mind, buddhi etc&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; are returned to th=\r\ne original sources from which they were\n borrowed and&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; mad=\r\ne sentient. But a jeevanmukta is free and unbound even while&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; operating with an identity, for binding comes from the conditioning and=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; not from identification or actions.

It is as simple as&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; that.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &n=\r\nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one engages in an action wit=\r\nh zero conditioning, then there is no&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; karma and ther=\r\ne are no rinas created. Actions (physical or mental) by&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; themselves do not bind one - it is\n the&nbsp; *conditioned* actions tha=\r\nt&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bind one! It is the likes, dislikes, desires, agen=\r\ndas etc (i.e.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conditioning in chitta) behind an acti=\r\non that bind one!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbs=\r\np; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If somebody who is not YET=\r\n a jeevanmukta (but close) identified with a&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; body an=\r\nd engaged in an action that IS driven by some conditioning,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; however subtle or pure or dharmik that conditioning may be (!), the=\r\nn&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that sets in motion the law of kaarmik action-reac=\r\ntion which will in&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; due time give a particular reacti=\r\non to what one identified with when&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; engaging in that=\r\n action.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the time the reaction is experienced, al=\r\nl the conditioning may be&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; overcome and one may becom=\r\ne jeevanmukta. Yet, the momentum\n set in&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; motion befo=\r\nre one became jeevanmukta will continue to affect the body,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; senses and sensory mind, i.e. whatever one&#39;s ahamkara is identifyin=\r\ng&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with. But, because there is no conditioning and he=\r\nnce no agendas, no&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desires, no likes and dislikes, o=\r\nne neither rejoices nor protests nor&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tries to modify=\r\n the happenings to what one is identifying with.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *&n=\r\nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Sensing that there is a pain requires no conditioning. It is the&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; function of manas, i.e. Chandra. Observing that there is =\r\nmore pain in&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the evening than morning (or when swall=\r\nowing) requires no&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conditioning. It is the function =\r\nof buddhi, i.e. Budha. But thinking&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of praying to go=\r\nd to reduce pain requires\n conditioning in chitta&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (a=\r\nbsent in a jeevanmukta!).&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though a jeevanmukta is id=\r\nentifying with a body, one does not view it&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as somet=\r\nhing his own and something that must be kept in a particular&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; state. He identifies with it, but has no agendas for it. All that&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comes from conditioning in chitta, which is absent n=\r\now!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The unconditioned identifier (liberated I-ness) =\r\nviews what one&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; identifies with as an *amalgam* of po=\r\nrtions borrowed from various&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deities (pancha mahabho=\r\notas, Moon, Mercury, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Time&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; etc)=\r\n and hence as a manifestation of Light itself. One does not view&lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; it from the prism of &quot;this is me, I need to use it to pursue X=\r\n or Y&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; agenda.&quot; One views it as &quot;this is me. I am mad=\r\ne of portions\n borrowed&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from various deities, i.e. v=\r\narious manifestations of Light. I observe&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their play=\r\n, i.e. what they do, and I have no agenda pursue using&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; them.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is the essence of Upanishads and Yoga=\r\n Vaasishtham, as well as&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mantra Pushpam that we were=\r\n discussing a while back.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I repeat, identification i=\r\ns not the problem. It is the conditioning&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that drive=\r\ns how one uses what one identifies with, that is the&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n problem.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp=\r\n; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I now feel like I have expressed m=\r\nyself better, though, given how&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; subtle and nuanced t=\r\nhis knowledge is, some people may still get&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confused=\r\n (if so, please don&#39;t worry. Not a big deal. Just keep doing&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt;\n &gt; sadhana, for that&#39;s the most important thing!). I am grateful to&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Manish and Maharshi Vasishtha for giving me this opp=\r\nortunity.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, whether Ramakrishna really got throat=\r\n cancer because of his&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;insult&quot; of Trilinga Swami or=\r\n because he took the kaarmik power of&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attorney from =\r\nGirish (a drunkard and womanizer at the time) can be&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n debated. Strictly speaking, whether Ramakrishna really became a&lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; jeevanmukta in that lifetime or not can also be debated.

Not that he was oblivious&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the =\r\nsuffering. And, we say that he was a Jeevanmukta. So how can&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; that happen, if according to that definition, the mind must be&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; identifying 24/7 with Atma to be qualified as a Jeevanm=\r\nukta?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The answer is straight forward.

Manish&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; loosely (in my view) said in this exchange that rinas are of body and&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; a jeevanmukta continues to fulfil those rinas. B=\r\nut body is an&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; insentient object. It has no rinas=\r\n. The rinas are not of the body,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; but of the mind=\r\n that identifies with it. It is the antahkaranas of&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&=\r\ngt; mind - ahamkara (I-ness) and chitta (memory/conditioning) - that are&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the source of various rinas, particularly chitta. =\r\nAs mind identifies&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with a body, it projects its =\r\nrinas on the body and makes the body&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;experience=\r\n&quot; and\n &quot;do&quot; things, in accordance with those&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; rin=\r\nas/conditioning. If the conditioning in chitta is completely wiped&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; out and ahamkara merges in Self, then it is mukti. But, =\r\nif the&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta is completely wipe=\r\nd out and yet ahamkara&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; continues to exist with n=\r\no limiting notions (it is basically the&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conditio=\r\nning in chitta that is limiting), then one becomes&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; jeevanmukta (liberated while living). Unlike in the case of one who&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; leaves body and gets mukti, a jeevanmukta continues =\r\nto have an I-ness&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (but which is not limited by a=\r\nny notions or conditioning). This&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; unconditioned =\r\nI-ness does project into a body. But it does not say &quot;I&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt;&gt; am this body and hence this body should be kept healthy or\n strong&quot;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (THAT would be conditioning in chitta, which is=\r\n wiped out now!). On&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the other hand, it does not=\r\n either say &quot;this body should be ignored&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and des=\r\ntroyed&quot;. Though conditioning is absent now, body keeps&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt; experiencing and doing things based on the *momentum* set in motion&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; before one became jeevanmukta and engaged in con=\r\nditioned experiences&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and actions. This is like a=\r\n fan turning for a while after the&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; electricity h=\r\nas been stopped. Manas, buddhi and indriyas keep working&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; as they did before. If one has throat cancer, indriyas may sense&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; pain. Manas (sensory/motor mind) may process that=\r\n input and register&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; pain. Buddhi may analyze var=\r\nious observations and draw various&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n &gt;&gt; conclusions =\r\n(e.g. &quot;when I gulp or try to swallow food, it hurts even&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; more&quot;, &quot;when I take so and so herbal liquid, it feels better&quot; etc)=\r\n. A&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; normal person whose conditioned mind (chitta=\r\n) says &quot;I should overcome&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and not have this pain=\r\n&quot; may think of various things to do and&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; struggle=\r\n with them. But an unconditioned being has no such&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; considerations. Though one may feel and express the pain and other&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; objective experiences, one reacts to it differently. =\r\n* =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; * =C3=83=E2=80=9A&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A * This is a key point=\r\n: Manas and buddhi are good at making&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; objective =\r\nobservations and rational deductions, but, by themselves,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; they do not have ANY agenda. They neither\n like something nor dis=\r\nlike&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; something. THAT comes from the conditioning=\r\n in chitta!

A better&lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt;&gt; way to express your question is: Can a jeevanmukta get th=\r\nroat cancer&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and feel pain? How is it possible if=\r\n there are no karmas or rinas&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; left? I have alrea=\r\ndy answered it. But, let me sum it up briefly&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ag=\r\nain. Body, various body parts, jnanendriyas, karmendiyas, manas and&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; buddhi of a jeevanmukta continue to operate as before. =\r\nOne&#39;s I-ness&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is intact and does project itself o=\r\nnto those. But neither I-ness nor&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n &gt;&gt; those things =\r\ncarry any rinas or karmas. Chitta - the repository of&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt; conditioning and rinas - is clean. There are no limiting notions.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; One&#39;s body, indriyas, manas &amp; buddhi keep exper=\r\niencing and doing&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; things (good or bad!) based on=\r\n the previous momentum set by the play&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of rnas a=\r\nnd karmas while some conditioning was left in chitta. Body,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt; various body parts, indriyas of jnana and karma and manas are a=\r\nll&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; portions borrowed from various deities. Ahamk=\r\nara (I-ness) infuses&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sentience into them by proj=\r\necting awareness into them. The&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in =\r\nchitta is what drives how all these are viewed and&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; used. Instead of looking at a sense organ as a portion of Indra or&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Mitra, one views it as\n &quot;my so and so sense organ&quot;, d=\r\nue to&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta. That is what creat=\r\nes karmas and rinas. When&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that conditioning is *=\r\ncompletely* overcome, ahamkara can still&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; project=\r\n awareness into those objects, but it sees them for what they&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; are. It does not have false and limiting notions like &quot;this t=\r\nhroat is&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mine and MUST feel nice and not feel pa=\r\ninful&quot;. * =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp;=\r\n =C3=83=E2=80=9A * =C3=83=E2=80=9A&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A * Most people who m=\r\nay claim to be (or think they are) jeevanmuktas&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nare not really jeevanmuktas in today&#39;s world.

There may be other books that explain better how to do&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; various sadhanas to progress spiritually and get closer to being&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; liberated oneday. But, when it comes elaborating =\r\nwhat liberation&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; while living actually is, there =\r\nis none better than Yoga Vaasishtham.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Of course,=\r\n one can say that this is merely an intellectual exercise&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; as far as *we* are concerned. It perhaps is, as none of may ever&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; become a jeevanmukta.. One word of caution: I wr=\r\nite with a very&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; confident tone when I have stron=\r\ng conviction in what I write. That is&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; how I am. =\r\nBut I can definitely be wrong. So please feel free to&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt; ignore me! :-) Happy\n Shivaratri (tomorrow night) to all!
