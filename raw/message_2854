While different places and times have some=\r\n difference in the nature and degree of spiritual energy, one can experienc=\r\ne anything anywhere anytime, if the internal factors are conducive.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; (2) What I said about Dakshineshwar vs Kalighat is purely my observation.=\r\n Please bear in mind that any observation is fallible! It is possible that =\r\nKalighat has similar or higher spiritual energy compared to Dakshineshwar a=\r\nnd I simply failed to perceive it. What we are able to perceive and observe=\r\n is also based on our own mental conditioning and our own karmik debts. The=\r\n Mother is capable of deluding *anyone*.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But then, what ever the=\r\n idol may contain, postive/negative/ creative/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; destruction, if someon=\r\ne prays to it with devotion, assuming that it is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reaching God, is it =\r\nnot enough?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The purpose of an idol is to evoke certain imagery or =\r\nthought in you. If a spiritual person imagines a particular energy or form =\r\nof god in a particular object on a continuous basis, slowly that form gets =\r\n&quot;established&quot; in that idol. As time goes on, his mind can be focused on tha=\r\nt specific form faster and easier by simply looking at the idol. Though we =\r\nthink that our minds are separate entities, they are all connected feebly a=\r\nnd all of us are able to perceive in some vague form other people&#39;s strong =\r\nthoughts that are present in the ether. Thus, if an idol is working as a re=\r\npository of several spiritual thoughts of a person trying to focus on a for=\r\nm of god, seeing that idol can evoke some similar thoughts in another perso=\r\nn too.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, there is some translation involved when thoughts o=\r\nf one mind are vaguely perceived and interpreted by another mind. This tran=\r\nslation is dependent on one&#39;s mental conditioning. Thus, what we perceive a=\r\nt the end is conformant to our own mental conditioning!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Suppose a =\r\nfoolish person thought while praying to an idol everyday of a fierce goddes=\r\ns who kills all of one&#39;s enemies, brings people under one&#39;s control and mak=\r\nes one successful. Suppose you focus on that idol. Then you are susceptible=\r\n to that kind of thoughts. However, if you see her as someone who helps you=\r\n overcome your weaknesses and become dispassionate, nothing bad is going to=\r\n happen to you. But the fact that someone used that idol as a repository of=\r\n negative thoughts becomes a minor obstruction.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, please no=\r\nte that this principle works without an idol too. Suppose someone goes to a=\r\n particular place (e.g. a church bench) and prays to god with certain desir=\r\nes/thoughts everyday. Those thoughts are present in the air there. Anyone p=\r\nraying there later may be a little susceptible to such thoughts. The concen=\r\ntration of thoughts may be a little higher when an idol serves as a reposit=\r\nory as opposed to just air. That&#39;s all.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, please note that =\r\nmost people have some devotion, some surrender, some love and some fear of =\r\nwrong-doing when they are praying to god, within or without an idol. Thus, =\r\nany negative and selfish thoughts are also accompanied by a lot of desirabl=\r\ne thoughts. Thus, the downside I mentioned is not a big deal. This downside=\r\n becomes considerable only in rare cases of really taamasik sadhakas indulg=\r\ning in terrible practices without understanding what they are doing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; is Idol worship risky?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bottomline is that I do not see any ri=\r\nsk in idol worship.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Does Man create God, or God c=\r\nreates man?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; God created man as his replica. But the replica got co=\r\nrrupted with time. Now, man needs to recreate god in his mind and fill the =\r\nmind with god, so that he can go back to the source and become free from th=\r\nis cycle. But, due to the corruptions/ conditioning of the mind, he is not =\r\nable to create god correctly. He ends up creating god as a replica of his c=\r\nurrent corrupt state! The goal is to keep creating god in mind and keep ref=\r\nining him and hence keep refining oneself and eventually become pure. When =\r\none is pure and creates god as a replica of oneself, that god will match th=\r\ne god that created man in the first place. When that god fills one&#39;s mind, =\r\none is free from the cycle.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I saw people deviating =\r\nand speaking disrespectfully about respected spiritual leaders of other rel=\r\nigions.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In general, please remember that saying negative things ab=\r\nout people that one may not have understood fully or correctly is unwise.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From time to time, the Lord may send someone to a part of the world=\r\n to maintain the correct balance of dharma and adhrama that is required in =\r\nthat part of the world at that time. One cannot judge a yogi or spiritual t=\r\neacher based on how many misdeeds were done by people claiming to follow th=\r\nat person. Worse things may have happened if god did not send that person! =\r\nIf some people following a yogi or spiritual teacher attained some level of=\r\n realization, it means something. Let us not be harsh in judging people we =\r\nhave not met physically or otherwise.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If one is unhappy because of=\r\n misdeeds committed by people claiming to a follow a yogi or spiritual teac=\r\nher, that may be justified. But, Nature will correct things and change the =\r\nequilibrium from time and time. Leave things to Nature and do your part by =\r\ndoing sadhana. In fact, my firm belief is that we are on the cusp of a big =\r\nchange in the equilibrium at many levels.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasi=\r\nmha\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; Do =\r\nPitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spiri=\r\ntuality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish les=\r\nsons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software =\r\n(Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://gro=\r\nups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) websi=\r\nte: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- - \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; From=\r\n: rajarshi nandy \n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursda=\r\ny, October 08, 2009 2:38 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Holy Places=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To add to my query, a good number of relig=\r\nions explicitly prohibit idol worship. If the underlying truth is one, how =\r\ncan it be so contradictory? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I can understand that a Idol may cont=\r\nain a presence created by human imagination which maynot have a divine link=\r\n. Not everybody is a Ramakrishna who can actually call Mahakali into an Ido=\r\nl.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But then, what ever the idol may contain, postive/negative/ cre=\r\native/ destruction, if someone prays to it with devotion, assuming that it =\r\nis reaching God, is it not enough? After all God is finally tax collecter o=\r\nf prayers. Does not all prayer finally reach God, irrespective of whether a=\r\n divine presence is there or not there infront?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I would like to me=\r\nntion a small incident here about someone I know well. There was a certain =\r\nindividual, who whenever he would go to Calcutta. he would take time out to=\r\n go and meditate in the hall infornt of the idol at the Kaalighat temple. O=\r\nnce he reached the temple around 8 pm and sat there trying to mediate for a=\r\nbout 2 hours. His mind suddenly became very focused, he *thought* he saw so=\r\nme deep blue lights (probably just his imagination) - but there was a disti=\r\nnct feeling of great joy in him. His mind become without thoughts as if the=\r\nre was no worry in the whole world, everything was perfect. Also a strong, =\r\nsanguine feeling came into him that he needed to worship the Goddess. As he=\r\n came out he found that his shoes were missing, so he walked more than a ki=\r\nlometer distance bare feet though an extremely dirty road but all he felt w=\r\nas a deep joy. Nothing was actually registering in his mind that night, exc=\r\nept for an overwhelming joy, as he said later\n on. Bottomline: a nice spiri=\r\ntual experience.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Some months later he ended up meeting a very spir=\r\nitual person who instructed him about worshipping the Goddess. He strongly =\r\nbelieves that night at the temple and his meeting with the person was relat=\r\ned. Interestingly, even that spiritual person told him that there is probab=\r\nly no divine presence inside the idol at Kaalighat temple.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now my =\r\nquestion is, if the idol at the Kaalighat temple did not have a divine pres=\r\nence why did this person suddenly have such a nice meditation there? Does i=\r\nt mean that finally it is only the devotion of the devotee which counts for=\r\n spiritual energy inside a temple, irrespective of whether the idol has any=\r\n energy at all?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 8/10/09=\r\n, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; From: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14=\r\n@ &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Holy Places\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ y=\r\nahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, 8 October, 2009, 8:24 PM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nNamaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In this context of divine pressence, is Idol worship risk=\r\ny?

Even after the saint leaves=\r\n that place or leaves earth altogether, that energy will linger there. Slow=\r\nly it becomes weak and disappears.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In many famous temples these da=\r\nys, priests have become commercial and do not have the devotion needed. The=\r\n rituals performed every few years to re-energize the idols \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is my humble opinion that some famous temples do not have much=\r\n divine presence today, though I do not want to name any names. At the same=\r\n time, some not-so-well- known temples seem to have a powerful divine prese=\r\nnce.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was very impressed with the Krishna temple in Mayapur (ISKC=\r\nON head office is there), Girnar hills in Gujarat and Arunachalam hills in =\r\nTiruvannamalai (Ramana Maharshi&#39;s place). There is a tremendous amount of s=\r\npiritual energy in those places. There are several temples where the idol i=\r\ns practically alive. For example, even 123 years after Ramakrishna Paramaha=\r\nmsa left, the Kaali idol at Dakshineshwar is &quot;alive&quot;. I did not get the sam=\r\ne impression at the famous Kalighat temple which is also in Calcutta.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; There was one small temple in Tamil Nadu that I was taken to by a pries=\r\nt who took me to visit about 30 temples all over Tamil Nadu before we did t=\r\nhe Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 2006. I never heard of that temple befo=\r\nre and it seemed like a small temple. The name of the form of the divine Mo=\r\nther present there was a Tamil language name and I did not understand it. I=\r\n do not even remember the name now. But, when I closed my eyes and started =\r\nmeditating with my mantra in front of the idol, I was dazzled by a vision o=\r\nf a very fierce goddess whose face was emiting rays like Sun. I felt that t=\r\nhere was a powerful presence there. Unfortunately, I do not remember the na=\r\nme of the place or the goddess, but it is a temple without roof over the go=\r\nddess. They tried to put a roof over the goddess a few times, but the roof =\r\ncame down in a fire accident each time and they finally decided that the go=\r\nddess likes open air and no roof. Though we spent only 5 min and\n left in a=\r\n hurry, I was very pleased with that temple. Someone from Tamil Nadu probab=\r\nly knows the name of the temple and goddess.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Like this, I am sure =\r\nthere are many temples with a powerful divine presence across India.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Apart from the Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar, one of my best experiences=\r\n when meditating was at the Krishna/Vitthal temple at Aalandi near Pune. I =\r\nam sure that Jnaneshwar Maharaj is still meditating in the underground cham=\r\nber there.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Even the middle of a busy road in India =\r\nis better for meditating than a temple in USA. These western countries are =\r\nso filled with rajas and tamas. There is rajas in India too, but there is a=\r\n good amount of sattwa there. Thus, any temple in India will be a good plac=\r\ne to meditate, but my view is that there is not much left at *some* temples=\r\n. But some temples are really good.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If one has a chance to spend a=\r\n few months doing spiritual sadhana near a temple, I suggest the following:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Mayapur, Dakshineshwar, Puri and Kamakhya in east India, Kurtaala=\r\nm, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam hills) and Narayana vanam (near Tirupati) in=\r\n south India, Shirdi, Aalandi, Dwaraka and Girnar mountains (Junagadh) in w=\r\nest India, Varanasi, Vrindavan and Hrishikesh in north India and Srisailam =\r\nand Mantralayam and Ujjain in central India.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There are many other =\r\ngood places, but the above come to my mind. Visiting a temple once is one t=\r\nhing and staying there for several months while maintaining a simple lifest=\r\nyle and doing a spiritual sadhana (like homam or japam) there is quite anot=\r\nher.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: =\r\nhttp://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http=\r\n://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo=\r\n.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro=\r\n. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAs=\r\nt rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/Jyotish=\r\nWri tings\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.=\r\norg\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; From: Astro Seeker \n&gt; &gt; T=\r\no: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 07, 2009 9:=\r\n11 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Holy Places\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Respected Narsimhaji=\r\n, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I would like to know your opinion on holy places (famous t=\r\nemples etc) in today&#39;s time.

But, I have few thought I want to put in front =\r\nof every one: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1. When we meet few people, some we like in=\r\nstantly and some\n we hate. Narasimha once told me this could be due to karm=\r\nic debts between people. I would like to extend the same to places, form of=\r\n God/Goddess, template.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I was in Kolkota for 5 years. I we=\r\nnt to Dakshineswar several times but avoided visiting Kalighat even once. W=\r\nhy? I heard the Kalighat is a red light area and you can meet broken with i=\r\nn template premises. Also, I heard, that the temple continues to have jantu=\r\n bali and that the temple floor has animal blood flowing. These may be exag=\r\ngerations, but, I had developed a prejudice against the Kalighat temple.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Now a days, I repent my narrow mindedness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nMy mental condition between 1992-97 did not allow me to even consider going=\r\n to Kalighat. My mental condition now will allow it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Our e=\r\nxperiance may depend on our mental condition.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2. To percei=\r\nve spiritual energy, we may have to have a karmic relation with that energy=\r\n. We may\n need to have matching wavelength to recieve the same.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; If I sit in a place and here to the voices, I will understand message=\r\ns in Telugu/Hindi/ English. How ever, if there is beautiful message in Oriy=\r\na or some other language, I may not perceive (I am not undermining Narasimh=\r\na&#39;s ability to perceive energy).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; God is omni present. His =\r\nenergy is present any where and every where. How ever, we do not perceive i=\r\nt till we are pure and our mental and spiritual conditioning allow it.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If in a place, there is any energy matching our conditioning, =\r\nwe may experience.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Vijay&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---=\r\n In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%4=\r\n0yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wi=\r\nsdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;Narasimha P.V.=\r\nR.

Whil=\r\ne different places and times have some difference in the nature and degree =\r\nof spiritual energy, one can experience anything anywhere anytime, if the i=\r\nnternal factors are conducive.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (2) What I said a=\r\nbout Dakshineshwar vs Kalighat is purely my observation. Please bear in min=\r\nd that any observation is fallible! It is possible that Kalighat has\n simil=\r\nar or higher spiritual energy compared to Dakshineshwar and I simply failed=\r\n to perceive it. What we are able to perceive and observe is also based on =\r\nour own mental conditioning and our own karmik debts. The Mother is capable=\r\n of deluding *anyone*.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; But then, what ever =\r\nthe idol may contain, postive/negative/ creative/&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; destruc=\r\ntion, if someone prays to it with devotion, assuming that it is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; reaching God, is it not enough?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The purpo=\r\nse of an idol is to evoke certain imagery or thought in you. If a spiritual=\r\n person imagines a particular energy or form of god in a particular object =\r\non a continuous basis, slowly that form gets &quot;established&quot; in that idol. As=\r\n time goes on, his mind can be focused on that specific form faster and eas=\r\nier by simply looking at the idol. Though we think that our minds are separ=\r\nate entities, they are all connected feebly and all of us are\n able to perc=\r\neive in some vague form other people&#39;s strong thoughts that are present in =\r\nthe ether. Thus, if an idol is working as a repository of several spiritual=\r\n thoughts of a person trying to focus on a form of god, seeing that idol ca=\r\nn evoke some similar thoughts in another person too.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; However, there is some translation involved when thoughts of one mind =\r\nare vaguely perceived and interpreted by another mind. This translation is =\r\ndependent on one&#39;s mental conditioning. Thus, what we perceive at the end i=\r\ns conformant to our own mental conditioning!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sup=\r\npose a foolish person thought while praying to an idol everyday of a fierce=\r\n goddess who kills all of one&#39;s enemies, brings people under one&#39;s control =\r\nand makes one successful. Suppose you focus on that idol. Then you are susc=\r\neptible to that kind of thoughts. However, if you see her as someone who he=\r\nlps you overcome your weaknesses and become\n dispassionate, nothing bad is =\r\ngoing to happen to you. But the fact that someone used that idol as a repos=\r\nitory of negative thoughts becomes a minor obstruction.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; However, please note that this principle works without an idol too.=\r\n Suppose someone goes to a particular place (e.g. a church bench) and prays=\r\n to god with certain desires/thoughts everyday. Those thoughts are present =\r\nin the air there. Anyone praying there later may be a little susceptible to=\r\n such thoughts. The concentration of thoughts may be a little higher when a=\r\nn idol serves as a repository as opposed to just air. That&#39;s all.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; However, please note that most people have some devotion,=\r\n some surrender, some love and some fear of wrong-doing when they are prayi=\r\nng to god, within or without an idol. Thus, any negative and selfish though=\r\nts are also accompanied by a lot of desirable thoughts. Thus, the downside =\r\nI mentioned is not a big deal. This\n downside becomes considerable only in =\r\nrare cases of really taamasik sadhakas indulging in terrible practices with=\r\nout understanding what they are doing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; is I=\r\ndol worship risky?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bottomline is that I do not s=\r\nee any risk in idol worship.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Does Man create God, or God creates man?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; God created man as his replica. But the replica got corrupted w=\r\nith time. Now, man needs to recreate god in his mind and fill the mind with=\r\n god, so that he can go back to the source and become free from this cycle.=\r\n But, due to the corruptions/ conditioning of the mind, he is not able to c=\r\nreate god correctly. He ends up creating god as a replica of his current co=\r\nrrupt state! The goal is to keep creating god in mind and keep refining him=\r\n and hence keep refining oneself and eventually become pure. When one is pu=\r\nre and creates god as a\n replica of oneself, that god will match the god th=\r\nat created man in the first place. When that god fills one&#39;s mind, one is f=\r\nree from the cycle.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; I saw people deviating and speaking disrespectfully about respected sp=\r\niritual leaders of other religions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In general, =\r\nplease remember that saying negative things about people that one may not h=\r\nave understood fully or correctly is unwise.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Fro=\r\nm time to time, the Lord may send someone to a part of the world to maintai=\r\nn the correct balance of dharma and adhrama that is required in that part o=\r\nf the world at that time. One cannot judge a yogi or spiritual teacher base=\r\nd on how many misdeeds were done by people claiming to follow that person. =\r\nWorse things may have happened if god did not send that person! If some peo=\r\nple following a yogi or spiritual teacher attained some level of realizatio=\r\nn, it means\n something. Let us not be harsh in judging people we have not m=\r\net physically or otherwise.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If one is unhappy be=\r\ncause of misdeeds committed by people claiming to a follow a yogi or spirit=\r\nual teacher, that may be justified. But, Nature will correct things and cha=\r\nnge the equilibrium from time and time. Leave things to Nature and do your =\r\npart by doing sadhana. In fact, my firm belief is that we are on the cusp o=\r\nf a big change in the equilibrium at many levels.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- =\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam You=\r\nrself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do Pitr=\r\ni Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; tar=\r\nget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wi=\r\nsdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic-=\r\n wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedi=\r\ncastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro.=\r\n home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;=\r\nhttp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sri Jagan=\r\nnath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ----=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; From: rajarshi nan=\r\ndy &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To: &lt;A\n href=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?t=\r\no=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/=\r\nA&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, October 08, 2009 2:38 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Subj=\r\nect: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Holy Places&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To add to my query, a good number=\r\n of religions explicitly prohibit idol worship. If the underlying truth is =\r\none, how can it be so contradictory? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I can unde=\r\nrstand that a Idol may contain a presence created by human imagination whic=\r\nh maynot have a divine link. Not everybody is a Ramakrishna who can actuall=\r\ny call Mahakali into an Idol.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; But then, what eve=\r\nr the idol may contain, postive/negative/ creative/ destruction, if someone=\r\n prays to it with devotion, assuming that it is reaching God, is it not eno=\r\nugh? After all God is\n finally tax collecter of prayers. Does not all praye=\r\nr finally reach God, irrespective of whether a divine presence is there or =\r\nnot there infront?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I would like to mention a sma=\r\nll incident here about someone I know well. There was a certain individual,=\r\n who whenever he would go to Calcutta. he would take time out to go and med=\r\nitate in the hall infornt of the idol at the Kaalighat temple. Once he reac=\r\nhed the temple around 8 pm and sat there trying to mediate for about 2 hour=\r\ns. His mind suddenly became very focused, he *thought* he saw some deep blu=\r\ne lights (probably just his imagination) - but there was a distinct feeling=\r\n of great joy in him. His mind become without thoughts as if there was no w=\r\norry in the whole world, everything was perfect. Also a strong, sanguine fe=\r\neling came into him that he needed to worship the Goddess. As he came out h=\r\ne found that his shoes were missing, so he walked more than a kilometer dis=\r\ntance bare feet\n though an extremely dirty road but all he felt was a deep =\r\njoy. Nothing was actually registering in his mind that night, except for an=\r\n overwhelming joy, as he said later on. Bottomline: a nice spiritual experi=\r\nence.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Some months later he ended up meeting a ve=\r\nry spiritual person who instructed him about worshipping the Goddess. He st=\r\nrongly believes that night at the temple and his meeting with the person wa=\r\ns related. Interestingly, even that spiritual person told him that there is=\r\n probably no divine presence inside the idol at Kaalighat temple.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Now my question is, if the idol at the Kaalighat temple d=\r\nid not have a divine presence why did this person suddenly have such a nice=\r\n meditation there? Does it mean that finally it is only the devotion of the=\r\n devotee which counts for spiritual energy inside a temple, irrespective of=\r\n whether the idol has any energy at all?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; -Regard=\r\ns&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 8/10/09, ra=\r\njarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; From: rajarshi nandy =\r\n&lt;rajarshi14@ &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Holy Plac=\r\nes&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=\r\n=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/=\r\nA&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, 8 October, 2009, 8:24 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In this context =\r\nof divine pressence, is Idol worship risky?

The rituals performed every few years to re-energi=\r\nze the idols &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I=\r\nt is my humble opinion that some famous temples do not have much divine pre=\r\nsence today, though I do not want to name any names. At the same time, some=\r\n not-so-well- known temples seem to have a powerful divine presence.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I was very impressed with the Krishna temple in Mayapu=\r\nr (ISKCON head office is there), Girnar hills in Gujarat and Arunachalam hi=\r\nlls in Tiruvannamalai (Ramana Maharshi&#39;s place). There is a tremendous amou=\r\nnt of spiritual energy in those places. There are several temples where the=\r\n idol is practically alive. For example, even 123 years after Ramakrishna P=\r\naramahamsa left, the Kaali idol at Dakshineshwar is &quot;alive&quot;. I did not get =\r\nthe same impression at the famous Kalighat temple which is also in Calcutta=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; There was one small temple in Tamil Nadu that\n=\r\n I was taken to by a priest who took me to visit about 30 temples all over =\r\nTamil Nadu before we did the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 2006. I never=\r\n heard of that temple before and it seemed like a small temple. The name of=\r\n the form of the divine Mother present there was a Tamil language name and =\r\nI did not understand it. I do not even remember the name now. But, when I c=\r\nlosed my eyes and started meditating with my mantra in front of the idol, I=\r\n was dazzled by a vision of a very fierce goddess whose face was emiting ra=\r\nys like Sun. I felt that there was a powerful presence there. Unfortunately=\r\n, I do not remember the name of the place or the goddess, but it is a templ=\r\ne without roof over the goddess. They tried to put a roof over the goddess =\r\na few times, but the roof came down in a fire accident each time and they f=\r\ninally decided that the goddess likes open air and no roof. Though we spent=\r\n only 5 min and left in a hurry, I was very pleased with that\n temple. Some=\r\none from Tamil Nadu probably knows the name of the temple and goddess.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Like this, I am sure there are many temples with a p=\r\nowerful divine presence across India.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Apart from=\r\n the Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar, one of my best experiences when meditat=\r\ning was at the Krishna/Vitthal temple at Aalandi near Pune. I am sure that =\r\nJnaneshwar Maharaj is still meditating in the underground chamber there.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Even the middle o=\r\nf a busy road in India is better for meditating than a temple in USA. These=\r\n western countries are so filled with rajas and tamas. There is rajas in In=\r\ndia too, but there is a good amount of sattwa there. Thus, any temple in In=\r\ndia will be a good place to meditate, but my view is that there is not much=\r\n left at *some* temples. But some temples are really good.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; If one has a chance to spend a few months\n doing spiritual sadha=\r\nna near a temple, I suggest the following:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Mayap=\r\nur, Dakshineshwar, Puri and Kamakhya in east India, Kurtaalam, Tiruvannamal=\r\nai (Arunachalam hills) and Narayana vanam (near Tirupati) in south India, S=\r\nhirdi, Aalandi, Dwaraka and Girnar mountains (Junagadh) in west India, Vara=\r\nnasi, Vrindavan and Hrishikesh in north India and Srisailam and Mantralayam=\r\n and Ujjain in central India.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; There are many oth=\r\ner good places, but the above come to my mind. Visiting a temple once is on=\r\ne thing and staying there for several months while maintaining a simple lif=\r\nestyle and doing a spiritual sadhana (like homam or japam) there is quite a=\r\nnother.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n-------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedic=\r\nast/&quot; target=3D_blank\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ =\r\nhomam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedica=\r\nst/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ ta=\r\nrpana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; target=3D_blan=\r\nk rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro./&quot; target=3D_=\r\nblank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;/A&gt; home.comcast. net&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D=\r\n_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Jyot=\r\nish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;ht=\r\ntp://groups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sri Jaganna=\r\nth Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagan/&quot; target=3D_blank r=\r\nel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;/A&gt; nath.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n --------- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; From: Astro Seeker &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesd=\r\nay, October 07, 2009 9:11 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Holy Plac=\r\nes&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Respected Narsimhaji, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I would like to know your opinion on holy places (famous=\r\n temples etc) in today&#39;s time.
