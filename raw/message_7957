For Gre=\r\nat Sage Narada it is one for somebody-else may be other.\nHowever Karma & It=\r\ns unfailing reactions is Universal and does not depend upon D/K/P (like Unc=\r\nooked rice). That may be probably one of the reason why Vedas does not have=\r\n mention about this.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal    \n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, &quot;S&quot; &lt;tejomaya101@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste- the Rishi Narada is=\r\n said to have defined it as &quot;paropakaram punyam, paapam parapeedanam=A8. In=\r\n other words- something that helps others is punyam and that which hurts ot=\r\nhers is paapam. A simple aphorism or definition which is pretty simple and =\r\neasy to understand..\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\natleast a couple spiritual giants emphatically said that there is no word c=\r\nalled &quot;Papa&quot; (Sin) in Vedas!\n&gt; &gt; It is all karmas & Its reactions! define i=\r\nt as Paapa, Punya or something else which suits ones mental conditioning.

All which is offered in=\r\n Havan is for feeding various deities. It is also feeding some higher souls=\r\n albeit at different level.\n&gt; &gt; Hence it is not wastage but most definitely=\r\n a desirable Karma.
