It&#39;s a little gem of a place that a=\r\nlso contains every imaginable item needed for Hindu rituals- from beautiful=\r\n deity murthis to brass lamps and camphor.\n\nI would recommend this place fo=\r\nr any wannabe homam-doer in the UK. And no, I don&#39;t own the place, know the=\r\n owner or have any shares in it :P \nIt&#39;s just a great one-stop shop for wha=\r\nt what you need to get that homam fire going.\n\nOm \n\nAparna \n\n\n--- In vedic-=\r\nwisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;scsa_taker3&quot; &lt;scsa_taker3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Preparin=\r\ng a list of Areas per town, areas in which homam kunds are\n&gt; available.
