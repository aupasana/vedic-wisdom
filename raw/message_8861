Also, I am unaware of there being any ban=\r\n on the outer shell of coconut, as all parts of coconut are available at th=\r\ne local supermarkets, and the dried coconuts being available at the local I=\r\nndian markets. As far as other alternatives to coconuts are concerned, the =\r\nwood from the oak trees burns hot and clean producing a minimum of smoke. T=\r\nhere are many ways to deal with the problem of smoke if you are living in a=\r\n apartment or flat. And it depends on how much you want to spend on fans an=\r\nd ducts to draw the smoke outside of the apartment, so as to reduce the lik=\r\nelihood of smoke damage to the walls and painted surfaces. Hope this helps =\r\nyou get started again.\n\nWarm Regards\n\nAjaya\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, Anup Ray  wrote:\n \n Namaste All,\n =A0\n I&#39;d a very fundamental query.=\r\n\n I was planning to restart doing homam and came to know that these days th=\r\ne outer shell of coconut is banned in US.
