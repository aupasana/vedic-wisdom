Krishna clearly says in \nBhagavad Geeta &quot;Follow your own dharma. It is dangerous to follow someone \nelse&#39;s dharma&quot;.\n\nFollowing the path of dharma basically means engaging in the right \naction/duty. Right action varies from person to person, from time to time \nand from place to place. It is dependent on what nature expects from you, \nwhich in turn is based on who you have been in the past, what actions you \ndid in the past while identifying with the action, who you affected in the \npast (and how) with the actions that you identified with, what debts you \ncreated in the process, and what mental tendencies you accumulated until \nnow.\n\nIf, based on one&#39;s mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person \nto kill evil persons, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s mental \ntendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the message of \nuniformity of all religions, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s \nmental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the \nritual of homam in the world, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s \nmental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to make a lot of \nmoney and construct a temple, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.\n\n*        *        *\n\nThe dharma of a being may change from one life to another.\n\nAt the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma to kill his gurus, \nelders and relatives. The time then was such that there was too much weight \non earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight. Tremendous \ndestruction was to take place and civilization destroyed to a great extent, \nto welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna being a great warrior, \nit was his dharma to facilitate that. Some people he deeply loved and \nrespected were on the other side and it was his dharma to kill them.\n\nWhen the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as one of \nRamakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a \nprevious life, according to Ramakrishna), his dharma was different in this \nnew time and place. He was born to renounce material life despite his \naristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and inspire \ngenerations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and service to \nothers. When he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna \nsaid), his dharma based on the time and place may be something else.\n\n*        *        *\n\nThe tricky question is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s dharma?\n\nSome people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your own dharma \nand not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism. Though the concept \nof caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long time, the concept of \ncaste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by \nkilling birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was a \nkshatrita and a powerful king. He became a brahmana and and a maharshi \nlater. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with the varna \nof father, because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one \ndevelops in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one does.\n\nThus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to know your \ndharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas in \nthe world. Each person has individual dharma.\n\nKnowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very very very difficult. If one is pure \nenough, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our \nmind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of \nnoise from other parts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, we get \nconfused.\n\nWe should make the best judgment combining discrimination and intuition and \ndecide what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, but doing \nthe best we can is all that we can do!\n\nMore than following dharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage in \nactions without identification. *That* alone ensures that we are not \naccumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not build \ntoo much attachment to what we are doing. We should engage in the best \npossible actions (based on our best judgment on what our dharma in the given \nsituation is), with as little attachment and self-identification with the \naction as possible. When the action is finished, we should leave the result \nto god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it \nwork&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through \nuntached action) will simplify our ego and purify our consciousness slowly. \nAs we become purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma clearer. \nThere is a positive feedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our \ndharma clearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This is not easy, \nbut not as difficult as people think.\n\nThe bottomline is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense of \n&quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one engages in action with \nlittle attachment.\n\n*        *        *\n\nIn deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are the inputs. \nAnother external input is the words of scriptures and learned men. One can \nderive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place is given to one&#39;s spiritual \nmaster. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can take the words of \nthe master to determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.\n\nWhen Arjuna was confused about what his dharma was and thought killing gurus \nand relatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his \ndharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dharma \nand wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do sadhana, \nRamakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the material \nworld and do the work of Mother for him.\n\nOne who is not in tune with nature and does not know who one is, what one&#39;s \ndebts are and what nature expects from one can err in the judgment of what \none&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight into \none&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give perfect guidance.\n\n*        *        *\n\nBottomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles and \ndeclare that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person, from \ntime to time and from place to place. Also, there are no thumbrules to find \nout what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s understanding of one&#39;s \ndharma by increasing internal purity. By doing various kinds of spiritual \nsadhana (like homam, japam etc) and engaging in actions without much \nattachment, one can slowly purify oneself and refine one&#39;s understanding of \none&#39;s individual dharma.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, September 27, 2008 8:02 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Dharma\n\n\n&gt; Namaste to all\n&gt;\n&gt; i just finished my Aghora series\n&gt; and in it in last part\n&gt; Vimalanda says path of dharma is very personal.\n&gt; Can somebody share views on that and how can we approach\n&gt; towards it\n&gt; Does it has to do something with vedas and upanishads\n&gt;\n&gt; regards\n&gt; jitender\n\n\n"}}
