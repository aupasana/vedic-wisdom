This=C2=A0material in=\r\n this document is pretty inspiring. I am very happy to tell you=C2=A0that I=\r\n was able to do Chandi Homam all the nine days, thanks to your=C2=A0manual =\r\nand encouragement=C2=A0on this forum all the while. I=C2=A0did 6 homams wit=\r\nh SaptaSloki and=C2=A0did three homams with SaptaSati. It was an amazing ex=\r\nperience. Last time I did with Sapta Sati, I became very emotional while re=\r\nading &quot;Sarva mangala mangalye&quot; verse in 11th chapter and started forgetting=\r\n swaha after each verse, but was putting ahutis in the fire at the end of e=\r\nach verse, after a few verses, I composed myself again and resume saying &quot;s=\r\nwaha&quot; as usual. I was able to constantly feel that the mother was right the=\r\nre in front of my eyes in the fire and was filled with joy. I did not do ar=\r\ngala, kavacham and keelaka and suktams etc. I just did recite Siddha Kunjik=\r\na Stotram at the end on each day, whether I did the homam with sapta sloki =\r\nor saptasati. Please\n&gt;  confirm if I am doing the right thing. Someday I pl=\r\nan to add everything, for now, saptasati itself is overwhelming for me. \n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; Regarding the initiation, here is what I feel. It is better to be =\r\ninitiated if one has a chance. But otherwise that should not stop you from =\r\ndoing your sadhana, since the assurance is given by none other than the Mot=\r\nher herself. In 11th sloka of 12th chapter, she says, &quot;jaanata ajaanata vap=\r\ni balipujaam tathaa krtaam, pratIchchishyaamaham preetyaa vahnihomam thaa k=\r\nrtaam&quot; - that translates to &quot;I will accept with love this balipooja and hom=\r\nam, whether you do it with knowledge of doing it or not&quot;.=C2=A0When she her=\r\nself is saying this, why do we need any additional approvals from anyone? A=\r\nm I interpreting this well in this context, please confirm. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Als=\r\no, is the navaavarna mantram same as &quot;Om aim hrim srim chamundaayai vichche=\r\n&quot; ?\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Nagraj\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sat, 10/16/10, vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedi=\r\nc-wisdom] Re: Durga Saptashati Inner Meaning\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups=\r\n.com\n&gt; Date: Saturday, October 16, 2010, 12:25 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; \n&gt; It is my personal opinion that Strong and long standi=\r\nng urge should be considered as Initiation at least in this age.\n&gt; I know a=\r\n person who wanted to recite Chandi paatha regularly but was not able to al=\r\nmost for a year. He didnt have formal Guru then but he started oneday on re=\r\ngular basis without any initiation. later he ispired few people to start re=\r\nading CP.\n&gt; \n&gt; If one looks at this group, many have started CP and homam j=\r\nust by positive influences and no formal initiation.\n&gt; \n&gt; You are probably =\r\nvery right in your assumption when you say Adhikara to recite CP may be spr=\r\nung up due to Chandi is Ugraatiugra.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, Chandi is also Mother an=\r\nd though she may be Ugraatiugra, she is also Sumyaatisaumya. In this age of=\r\n Kali, She has become the later and she&#39;ll be happy if someone just prays w=\r\nith *slightest* of devotion to her by way of recitation of Chandipaatha. th=\r\nis is a strong conviction developed in me.
