Even great jnaanis\nare\n&gt; occasional=\r\nly deluded by Her power. One can understand unmanifested\nnon-dual\n&gt; Brahman=\r\n, but one cannot hope to understand the dual world fully ever.\nShe is\n&gt; cap=\r\nable of deluding even the greatest sadhaka with a wrong idea as\nsoon as\n&gt; o=\r\nne ventures into duality. She can mislead *anyone* on *anything*.\nWhat She\n=\r\n&gt; does and why She does that is so difficult to fathom. The only way to\ndea=\r\nl\n&gt; with Her is to surrender to Her power *fully*.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; on the other hand =\r\nwe are all a part of Divinity\n&gt;\n&gt; BTW, though we are all part of the same D=\r\nivinity, we are all not the\nsame.\n&gt; In the non-dual field, we are all the s=\r\name. But, in the field of\nduality, we\n&gt; have differences due to previous va=\r\nsanas (conditioning), which decide\nwhat\n&gt; and how much we can do within the=\r\n dual world. When a being like\nKrishna is\n&gt; born with 16 kalas, He can do *=\r\nanything* with the objects of the dual\nworld.\n&gt; When a being like Sai Baba =\r\nis born with 2 or 3 kalas, He can do a lot\nof\n&gt; things in the dual world th=\r\nat are impossible for others.\n&gt;\n&gt; Realizing the non-dual Self is something =\r\nthat is possible for anyone,\nbut\n&gt; there are limits imposed on what things =\r\none can do in the dual world,\nbased\n&gt; on the force of previous conditioning=\r\n. Thus, all are the same at one\n&gt; (non-dual) level and all are different at=\r\n another (dual) level.\n&gt;\n&gt; But it is tough to know for sure what one&#39;s cali=\r\nber is. Thus, your\nbasic\n&gt; point holds. But I just wanted to point that all=\r\n are not indeed the\nsame. We\n&gt; should be disinterested in knowing who is wh=\r\nat, not because all are\nthe\n&gt; same, but because we have no surefire way to =\r\nknow who is what.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http=\r\n://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ve=\r\ndic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net=\r\n\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Ja=\r\ngannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ---------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Mess=\r\nage -----\n&gt; From: &quot;Dinesh Nambisan&quot; dinesh@...\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com\n&gt; Sent: Monday, November 10, 2008 7:54 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] =\r\nRe: Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive today\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; || Om Lokaah Samastaah Sukh=\r\nino Bhavantuh ||\n&gt;\n&gt; Does it matter at all who is whose reincarnation?

One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as M=\r\nr.\nPatel)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was working as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of=C2 =\r\n=C2\n=C2 shri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was alway=\r\ns talking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. We came close day by day. There =\r\nwas a weekly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gathering at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his home called SATSANGA. He was si=\r\nnging devotional songs\ncreated\n&gt; &gt; &gt; by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him and was weeping while s=\r\ninging. He was reading Ramkrishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngster=\r\ns were attending this weekly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; meeting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on Saturday evening. I w=\r\nas then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of\n30\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then. We were used to go =\r\nto seashore daily at 7 pm after duty\nhours\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and were talking only ab=\r\nout Thakur.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One day when we were at sea shore he suddenly told me=\r\n--\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =E2?oRawalbhai,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some guest have come to my home and my wif=\r\ne is remembering me.\nMy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; son\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will come in a few minutes to cal=\r\nl me.

I was very much impressed about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He could f=\r\noresee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka by\nBus,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nold me not to go through bus, as bus tire will be punctured.\nYet I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nwent to Bus station but bus did not come from Dwarka as was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; punctured=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the way.

I was attracted\nto\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One =\r\nday I thought, I should also be disciple of\nshri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thakur and the day=\r\n came. It was 4/4/1974.

I thought-- yes I have\ntaken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hasty decision. I =\r\nwas in the influence of Mr. Patel. --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But I remember that Mr. Pat=\r\nel had told me that Thakur was\ntelling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their disciples to test him =\r\nbefore accepting him.

One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we=\r\n will call him as Mr. Patel)&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was working as Operator=\r\n. He was a staunch devotee of=C2 =C2 =C2 shri&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkri=\r\nshnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was always talking&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n about&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. We came close day by day. There =\r\nwas a weekly&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; gathering at&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his home=\r\n called SATSANGA. He was singing devotional songs created&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n by&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him and was weeping while singing.

Mr. Patel was of 30&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; then.

I was very much =\r\nimpressed about&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; him.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He could fore=\r\nsee the events.

I told to my wife in the morning that I have&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife was annoyed and&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; she&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; argued with me a lot. =E2?&quot;=E2?oWhy s=\r\nhould you take such a hasty&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; decision?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta. He&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; was a&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; great Saint but our Guru should be =\r\nliving one, who can guide us,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; give&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n us Mantra etc. etc. Better you take Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Acharya&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since you are doing Gayatri Mantra=E2?=\r\n=9D--.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Her arguments were right at her place as=\r\n people in general not&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; know&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much a=\r\nbout Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I have taken&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --&lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was=\r\n telling&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their disciples to test him before acceptin=\r\ng him. I also decided to&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test Thakur. I immediately =\r\ntold my wife that =E2?&quot;=E2?oSee, Mr. Patel&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; has&lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; never come to our home. You have also not seen him. He has nev=\r\ner&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; asked&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me where I am living. Sup=\r\npose Mr. Patel is coming to our house&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; within&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; 10 to 15 minutes, would you believe that my selection for Thakur=\r\n is&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perfect?=E2?=9D--&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sh=\r\ne laughed at me=E2?&quot;=E2?oHow it is possible? I don=E2?Tt believe.=E2?=9D-&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; -&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I prayed Shri Thakur to send=\r\n Mr. Patel immediately to justify my&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decision and co=\r\nnvince my wife. =E2?~I want to test your existence&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; even&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; today.=E2?T&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To our great =\r\nsurprise, Mr. Patel was at my home at 06.30 in the&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; m=\r\norning with angry mood. What he told?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =E2?~ How=\r\n dare you test Thakur this way? Do you know what happened?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; Yesterday was my night duty and I had just come to my home at 05.30&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mornings today and tried to sleep for 1 or 2 hours. =\r\nSuddenly Thakur&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pulled my blanket and told me that-=\r\n=E2?o Go to your friend=E2?Ts&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; house. He&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; is waiting for you. He wants to test me. I will show you his&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; house=E2?=9D&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I immediately rushed to =\r\nyour home. Thakur was guiding me the way&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; your house and pushing me too. What you want? Why you are&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; disturbing&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him in such an early morning f=\r\nor such a silly things?=E2?T&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We both were so ex=\r\ncited and surprised that we had no words that&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mornin=\r\ng.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will never forget that 5th April, a miracl=\r\ne day in my life.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; There&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were some =\r\nmore Devine experiences about Shri Thakur but I will&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; writ=\r\ne&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it sometime.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sir,=\r\n and forum members, Ramkrishandev is still alive on the&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; earth.
