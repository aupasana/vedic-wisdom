This is condemn=\r\ned by Lord Krishna\nin the Gita. Body is the moving temple of the Lord. It i=\r\ns an instrument for\nSelf-realisation. You cannot do any Sadhana if the body=\r\n is not kept strong\nand healthy. Attachment to Vairagya is as much an evil =\r\nas attachment to\nsensual objects. Give up Vairagya-Abhimana. This Abhimana =\r\nof Sadhus and\nSannyasins is more dangerous and inveterate than the Abhimana=\r\n of worldly\npersons.\n\nVairagya-Abhimana is a deadly canker. It is difficult=\r\n to get rid of the\nVairagya- Abhimana as long as there is the body-idea. Th=\r\ne feeling, &quot;I am a\ngreat Vairagi or Thyagi&quot; is Vairagya Abhimana. The body =\r\nof a Sannyasi, who\nhas dedicated it unto the service of humanity, is a publ=\r\nic property. He has\nno claim on it because he denies the existence of body =\r\nand tries to feel\nalways: &quot;I am Siva (Sivoham)&quot;. The public will take care =\r\nof his body.\n\nLord Buddha tortured the body, did severe austerities, gave u=\r\np food and yet\nhe was not able to attain the goal. He heard the song:\n\n&quot;Fai=\r\nr goes the dancing when the Sitar&#39;s tuned,\n\nTune us the Sitar neither low n=\r\nor high.\n\nAnd we will dance away the hearts of men\n\nThe string o&#39;erstretche=\r\nd breaks and the music flies,\n\nThe string o&#39;erslack is dumb and music dies,=\r\n\n\nTune us the Sitar neither low nor high.&quot;\n\nThen he ate food, adopted the m=\r\niddle path and succeeded in achieving\nNirvana. Extreme asceticism is not at=\r\n all necessary for attaining\nperfection. What is wanted is strong mental Va=\r\niragya born of strong\ndiscrimination. All bodies are not fit for the practi=\r\nce of severe\nausterities. The body will drop down if you tax it too much by=\r\n way of rigid\nTapas. Do not spoil your health and body in the name of Tapas=\r\n. Have a\nstrong, healthy body, but have no attachment for the body. Be prep=\r\nared to\ngive it up at any time for a noble cause.\n\nThe care-taker of the ho=\r\nrse feeds it with proper nutrition when it is\nover-worked, when it is ailin=\r\ng. Then only it is ready for further work. Even\nso, this body should be inj=\r\nected with proper nutrition. Then only it will\nturn out good work. Then onl=\r\ny it will soon regain its lost vitality on\naccount of overwork or ailment. =\r\nWork will suffer if the body is not well\nattended to. When the body grows o=\r\nld it must be well-protected against cold\nand well-looked after. If hard Ti=\r\ntiksha is practised now, it will give way\nsoon. Consequently, the other sho=\r\nre of immortality and fearlessness cannot\nbe reached.\n\nO Ram, neglect not t=\r\nhis body. The society and Prakriti will extract and\ncontinue to extract as =\r\nmuch work as possible from those selfless workers who\nhave dedicated their =\r\nlives to the service of humanity. They are yoked to\nservice till the last b=\r\nreath leaves their bodies. Lord Vishnu instructs\nPrahlada, &quot;My dear Prahlad=\r\na! Enough of your Tapas. Take care of your body.\nRise from your Samadhi. Se=\r\nrve people now. Disseminate Bhakti far and wide.&quot;\nYoga Vasishtha speaks of =\r\none as a &quot;Maha Tyagi&quot; and &quot;Maha Bhogi&quot;, who has\nrenounced the idea of &quot;I am=\r\n a Tyagi&quot; and &quot;I am a Vairagi&quot;, who neither\naccepts nor rejects things that=\r\n come by themselves by identifying himself\nwith the silent witness, the Imm=\r\nortal Atma, who feels always &quot;I am Akarta\n(non-doer)&quot;, &quot;I am Abhokta (non-e=\r\nnjoyer) &quot; even while moving amidst objects.\nThe Gita says, &quot;But the discipl=\r\nined self, moving among sense-objects, with\nsenses free from attraction and=\r\n repulsion mastered by the Self, goeth to\nPeace.&quot; Chapter II-64.\n\nSome neop=\r\nhytes and raw aspirants pose themselves for &quot;Maha Tyagins&quot; or &quot;Maha\nBhogins=\r\n&quot; and quote scriptures also: &quot;We eat without tongues; we see without\neyes&quot;.=\r\n The thief or the hypocrite will be found out soon. They are just like\nthe =\r\npeople who catch fishes from the Ganges to satisfy their palates and\nquote =\r\nGita:=97&quot;Nainam Chhindanti Sastrani Nainam Dahati Pavakah; Na chainam\nKleda=\r\nyantyapo na sosha-yati marutah&quot;=97&quot;Weapons cleave him not, nor fire\nburneth=\r\n him, nor waters wet him, nor wind drieth him away&quot;. Sublime\nphilosophy ind=\r\need of perverted people with perverted intellects! The gilted\nornaments can=\r\nnot shine for a long time. The crow that shines under borrowed\nfeathers of =\r\nthe peacock will be found out soon. Their Trishnas and Vasanas\nwill burst o=\r\nut and any lay bystander can detect the hypocrite without\ndifficulty.\n\nA Ma=\r\nha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi will not refuse to accept some mangoes or a cup\nof m=\r\nilk when they come by themselves. But he will not crave for them. He\nwill n=\r\not say, &quot;I have enjoyed today good mangoes or good milk.&quot; If an\naspirant is=\r\n seriously ailing, if he is not able to eat solid food-stuffs, if\nthere is =\r\na feeling of want in him for milk, if he has no money with him to\npurchase =\r\nmilk, if any devotee casually offers of his own accord some milk,\nhe should=\r\n not refuse it. God works mysteriously. He takes care of his\ndevotees by wo=\r\nrking through the minds of various persons.\n\nThe child sometimes eats food =\r\nat night while he is sleeping. If the mother\nasks the child in the morning.=\r\n &quot;Baby, you took food last night,&quot; he replies,\n&quot;I have not taken anything l=\r\nast night. You are playing and joking with me.&quot;\nSuch is the condition of a =\r\nJeevanmukta, or a Maha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi. He\neats and yet he does not eat=\r\n. He eats without a mouth and smells without a\nnose. Sometimes a man talks =\r\nat night when he dreams. If you ask him when he\ncomes to waking consciousne=\r\nss, &quot;O Prema! Do you know that you talked last\nnight when you were dreaming=\r\n?&quot; He replies &quot;I do not remember anything.&quot; Such\nis the state of a Jeevanmu=\r\nkta or a Maha Tyagi and Maha Bhogi.\n\nDurvasa ate a sumptuous meal and yet h=\r\ne said, &quot;I am a Nitya Upavasi. I do\nnot eat anything. I take grass juice on=\r\nly&quot;, because he identified himself\nwith the Atma who is always the witness =\r\nand the non-enjoyer. Lord Krishna is\nregarded as a Nitya Brahmachari though=\r\n he was with Radha, Rukmini and\nSatyabhama. Sage Tiruvalluvar said to his w=\r\nife, &quot;My beloved! Say unto the\nriver that my husband, a Nitya Brahmachari, =\r\nhas commanded you to give path\nof way. She will at once yield and you can c=\r\nross it without a boat.&quot; She\nrepeated the words of her husband and crossed =\r\nthe river immediately. She was\nquite amazed at the words of her husband and=\r\n asked him, &quot;My Lord! You are\nliving with me and yet you say that you are a=\r\n Nitya Brahmachari. I am struck\nwith wonder. I am puzzled. Kindly explain t=\r\nhis philosophy.&quot; Tiruvalluvar\nreplied, &quot;I am immortal Atma. I have realised=\r\n this through direct cognition\n(Anubhava). I do not do anything. I am the s=\r\nilent witness. The senses,\nbody, mind and intellect are my instruments. I a=\r\nm entirely distinct from\nthem.&quot; Tiruvalluvai&#39; s wife understood the nature =\r\nof the soul and then she\nbecame silent.\n\nOrdinary aspirants with delicate h=\r\nealth should not take recourse to the\npractice of drastic austerities. He w=\r\nho has attained Kaya Siddhi can do any\nkind of Tapas because his body is ad=\r\namantine. If an aspirant with delicate\nhealth gives up food and tries to li=\r\nve on neem leaves alone, the obvious\nresult is that he will get various sor=\r\nts of gastro-intestinal diseases and\npass away soon. This is the fruit obta=\r\nined by persons who practise Tamasic\nTapas.\n\nIf you have mastery over the p=\r\nair of opposites, viz., heat and cold, if you\ncan bear intense heat and int=\r\nense cold, if you can remain without clothing\nin the icy Gangotri, this is =\r\nhighly creditable indeed. But if your frame is\ndelicate, if you attempt to =\r\nstand before the sun in summer for some hours,\nif you throw off your clothi=\r\nng in the Gangotri all at once, you will die\nimmediately of sunstroke or pn=\r\neumonia. You should not attempt to take\nrecourse to these hard practices. W=\r\nhat little you will gain by Japa and\nmeditation in this birth will be lost,=\r\n and you have lost one chance given by\nthe Lord in this birth to reach him =\r\nby your foolish practices or Tamasic\nTapas.\n\nAn aspirant gave up his clothi=\r\nng all at once. He developed rheumatism,\nmalaria, enlarged spleen and died =\r\nwithin a short time. During the period of\nsickness all cravings that were t=\r\nemporarily suppressed asserted themselves\nwith re-doubled force. He became =\r\na slave of the tongue. He craved for many\nvarieties of food. He could not s=\r\nuppress them. He ate indiscriminately and\ndied of acute diarrhoea.\n\nAn aspi=\r\nrant said, &quot;I have not realised the Self though I did meditation for\nsome y=\r\nears. I am going to commit suicide with the Bhava, &quot;I am immortal\nAtma&quot;. I =\r\nhave got full Vairagya. No sin will cling to me, because my motive\nis pure.=\r\n I will attain self-realisation. &quot; He actually committed the\nabominable act=\r\n. Do you find such a statement anywhere in the scriptures?\nCertainly not. T=\r\nhis is extreme foolishness. Some aspirants who have no idea\nof the nature o=\r\nf true Vairagya, who have not lived under the guidance of\ntheir masters for=\r\n some time, commit such ignoble acts. They can never get\nsalvation by takin=\r\ng to wrong Tapas though their Bhava (motive) may be pure.\nThey cannot enter=\r\ntain the Bhava &quot;I am Atma&quot; just at the time of committing\nthe act. Horrible=\r\n thoughts will crowd at the critical juncture. They will\nhave to share obvi=\r\nously the fate of Pretas (ghosts).\n\nThe mind should gradually be weaned off=\r\n its old habits and cravings. If you\ncut off all at once its pleasure centr=\r\nes, it will get puzzled. That is the\nreason why young aspirants who take to=\r\n too much Vairagya commit the ignoble\nact of committing suicide. You should=\r\n train the mind in meditation gradually\nand make it taste the inner bliss. =\r\nGradually it will leave off its old\nhabits and old cravings and you can get=\r\n yourself established in true\nVairagya.\n\nThe more the Viveka, the more the =\r\ntrue Vairagya. The flower of Vairagya\ngradually grows in the garden of Anta=\r\nhkarana from the understanding that the\nworld is a mere appearance and full=\r\n of miseries and that Brahman alone is\nthe only reality full of knowledge a=\r\nnd bliss, and through continued practice\nof meditation and association with=\r\n the realised souls for a protracted\nperiod. Eventually, all objects of the=\r\n world appear before the dispassionate\nsoul as trifling or worthless things=\r\n. He will not give up his new spiritual\nlife even if the wealth of the whol=\r\ne world is offered to him.\n\nAspirants should give up those articles of food=\r\n which they like best for\nsome time. They should discipline all the Indriya=\r\ns in a perfect manner. They\nshould always lead a simple life. They should a=\r\nlways eat simple food. But\nthey should not become slaves of Vairagya. Abhim=\r\nan Vairagya is a mental\nstate. The Lord infuses this in his devotees in ord=\r\ner to get rid of the\nclinging to sensual objects.\n\nMay you all become Maha =\r\nTyagins and Maha Bhogis! May you all be free from\nthe canker of Vairagya Ab=\r\nhimana!\n\nMay you all possess true lasting Para Vairagya!!\n\nMay you all atta=\r\nin Kaivalya or perfection!! !\n\nReal Vairagya\n\nThere was a Sannyasi at Benar=\r\nes. He was a great Titikshu. He could bear heat\nand cold. In summer he used=\r\n to stand in the sun for some hours. In winter he\nused to stand in the Gang=\r\nes for some hours. He used to sleep on a bed of\ngrass. He shunned wooden co=\r\nts.\n\nOn one occasion one of his admirers, Sri Ram, took him to Mussoorie. S=\r\nri Ram\nprovided him a cot to sleep. The Sannyasi refused to sleep on the co=\r\nt. He\nasked him to provide a bed of grass. There was much rain on that day.=\r\n It was\nextremely difficult for him to get grass. Anyhow, Sri Ram managed t=\r\no get for\nthe Swami a bed of grass with great difficulty.\n\nSri Ram said: &quot;S=\r\nwamiji, it is very difficult to get grass here. It is\nraining now in torren=\r\nts. Kindly use the cot today. This will not bind you in\nany way. You are an=\r\n advanced Sannyasi. What is it for you whether the body\nlies on a bed of gr=\r\nass or on a cot?&quot; The Swamiji replied &quot;No, no, no. I must\nhave my usual bed=\r\n of grass only. You must bring it anyhow.&quot;\n\nAttachment to Vairagya is as mu=\r\nch an evil as attachment itself. Vairagya is\na means for attaining wisdom o=\r\nf the Self. It is not the goal itself. A\nJeevanmukta or realised sage has n=\r\neither Raga nor Vairagya. If you give him\na little dry bread alone, he is q=\r\nuite satisfied. He will not grumble. If you\ngive him best sweetmeats, milk =\r\nand fruits, he will not refuse, but he will\nnot be elated by good food. He =\r\nalways takes delight in his own Self only,\nbut not in external objects. Thi=\r\ns is the test to find out whether a man has\nattained realisation or not. A =\r\nworldly man is much troubled when he cannot\nget the right kind of food whic=\r\nh he likes best. He rejoices when he obtains\npalatable dishes. A realised s=\r\noul has equanimity of mind. He is above likes\nand dislikes.\n\nSuka Deva was =\r\ntested by Raja Janaka. He remained without food at the gate\nfor some days. =\r\nHe was quite peaceful. Then he was taken to the harem. Ranees\nserved him an=\r\nd gave him best food. He remained unaffected. This is wisdom.\n\nObviously, t=\r\nhe Swami who wanted a bed of grass at Mussoorie had not attained\nequanimity=\r\n of mind and Self-realisation. He was attached to Vairagya even\nafter sever=\r\nal years of spiritual practice. He was not completely free from\nall sorts o=\r\nf attachments because he was attached to Vairagya. He did not\nattain Sahaja=\r\n-Avastha or natural state wherein the Sage is quite indifferent\nto all kind=\r\ns of objects, wherein the sage would sleep on the bed of grass or\na beautif=\r\nul cot with mattress and pillow with the same feeling.\n\nHe who is endowed w=\r\nith equanimity of mind towards objects is called a Maha\nTyagi or Maha Bhogi=\r\n in Yoga Vasishtha. It is easy to practise Vairagya, but\nit is extremely di=\r\nfficult to keep the evenness of mind.\n\nSome Sannyasins who are working for =\r\nthe public good make resolves: &quot;We will\nnot travel in trains. We will walk =\r\nonly. We will not take milk, fruits, etc.\nWe will not use fountain pens or =\r\nwatch.&quot; These are not desirable resolves.\nThis is not the real nature of Va=\r\niragya. They are also attached to Vairagya.\nThis is another kind of defect.=\r\n They want to do service. If they move in\ncars or trains, if they keep the =\r\nbody strong and healthy, they can do more\nservice in a short space of time.=\r\n Those who do much writing-work can turn\nout much work if they use a founta=\r\nin pen. Foolishness assumes various forms.\nThis is one kind. It does not le=\r\nave even educated persons or cultured\nSannyasins.\n\nSome Sannyasins practise=\r\n Vairagya in order to gat Pratishta or fame and\nrespect. But God knows the =\r\nmotives of all, as He is the Antaryami or inner\nRuler. You cannot deceive H=\r\nim.\n\nWhere is the strength of Vairagya when one lives in seclusion, where t=\r\nhere\nis no temptation? Where is the strength of Vairagya when one has not\nr=\r\nenounced anything, when he has nothing to renounce, when he has not enjoyed=\r\n\nthe objects of the world, when there is no attraction in the mind for the\n=\r\nobjects of the world even though he shows externally that he is a great\nVir=\r\nakta or dispassionate man by putting on a gunny bag or keeping a small\nwood=\r\nen bowl only in his hand?\n\nRaja Janaka was amidst regal enjoyments. People =\r\nreported that the city of\nMithila was burst and yet, he was not a bit affec=\r\nted. That is real Vairagya.\nHe alone can be called a real great Virakta.\n\nY=\r\noung aspirants should be very careful and cautious. They should not take\nad=\r\nvantage of the liberty of a Maha Tyagi and a Maha Bhogi. This can be\npracti=\r\nsed only by an advanced Yogi who has got equal vision over all beings.\nBegi=\r\nnners should stick to their resolves of Truth, Ahimsa, Brahmacharya and\nVai=\r\nragya to the very letter and spirit.\n\nMay you all transcend Raga and Vairag=\r\nya and attain knowledge of the Self.\nMay you all understand the true nature=\r\n and Swaroopa of Vairagya.\n\nVairagya is the rein by which the uncontrollabl=\r\ne mind is restrained. Ripe\nVairagya is intense attachment to Atmic bliss an=\r\nd strong dispassion for\nanything other than Atma.\n\nIf one considers the pos=\r\nition and happiness of Brahma even as the dung of a\ncow, then only he has d=\r\neveloped a real lasting Vairagya. Temporary fleeting\ndispassion is not Vair=\r\nagya. It will not help the aspirant in the attainment\nof Self-realisation.\n=\r\n\nIt is common to have dispassion for some particular objects by some cause =\r\nor\nother. But by having dispassion for all objects at all times, one will g=\r\net\nknowledge of the Self. You may get Atma-Jnana soon by the grace of the G=\r\nuru,\nby devotion to him, and by practice of what he instructs.\n\nDo not fall=\r\n a victim of Moha even if you happen to move in towns with young\nand well-a=\r\ndored fashionable ladies of high civilised societies. Resolve to\nattain Sel=\r\nf-realisation. The Tamoguna will vanish of its own accord.\n\nDevotion, dispa=\r\nssion and knowledge of Atma are the three means of salvation.\nDispassion is=\r\n desirelessness This All-full Atma resides in the chambers of\nthe heart and=\r\n so everybody has this Atma.\n\nLight on Vairagya\n\nVairagya is born of Viveka=\r\n, discrimination between Nitya and Anitya (eternal\nand non-eternal) , Sat a=\r\nnd Asat (real and unreal), Tattwa and Atattwa.\nViveka comes through disinte=\r\nrested selfless service done in several births\nand through Puja and Aradhan=\r\na, and through the Grace of the Lord. From\nViveka is born Vairagya. It give=\r\ns spiritual strength.\n\nA man of Vairagya has no attraction for the world. I=\r\nt is like a straw. So\nVairagya is a supreme, inexhaustible wealth for aspir=\r\nants. Vairagya produces\nconcentration of mind, Samadhana, and generates bur=\r\nning Mumukshutwa, strong\nyearning for Liberation or Emancipation, or Releas=\r\ne.\n\nRaga is attachment to objects. Wherever there is a little pleasure, the=\r\nre is\nRaga. Wherever there is pain, there is dislike. Like and dislike are =\r\none.\nRaga-Dwesha is also one of the important afflictions, according to Pat=\r\nanjali\nMaharshi. The five afflictions are: Avidya (ignorance), Asmita (egoi=\r\nsm),\nRaga-Dwesha (like and dislike and Abhinivesha (clinging to life). Firs=\r\nt,\nthere is ignorance, the original Avidya. From this is born egoism, Asmit=\r\na,\nand from Asmita is born Raga-Dwesha, and from Raga-Dwesha, Abhinivesha, =\r\nthe\nclinging to this life.\n\nVairagya is of different types or degrees=97Mri=\r\ndu, Madhyama and Teevra (mild,\nmoderate and intense). Intense Vairagya only=\r\n will help the aspirant to stick\nto this path. If it is of a dull type like=\r\n Smasana Vairagya or Prasava\nVairagya, the mind will simply be waiting to g=\r\net back the objects that were\nrenounced previously, and the aspirant will g=\r\net a downfall. He will not be\nable to climb again to the heights he formerl=\r\ny reached. So aspirants should\nbe careful. Even though the Vairagya is of a=\r\n mild type, they should try to\nmake it moderate; and then intense Vairagya =\r\ncomes through looking into the\ndefects of sensual life. Sensual pleasure is=\r\n not real happiness. It is\nillusory, transient, impermanent. It is mixed wi=\r\nth pain. So again and again\nby looking into the defects of sensual life, Va=\r\niragya dawns. It should be\nstrengthened through study of spiritual books, S=\r\natsanga, Vichara and\nenquiry.\n\nSimply living in nudity and eating neem leav=\r\nes, and drinking cow&#39;s urine\ndoes not constitute real Vairagya. Vairagya sh=\r\nould be born of\ndiscrimination, enquiry and Vichara. By these, the mind is =\r\nweaned from\nsensual enjoyments and rendered thin like a thread=97Thanumanas=\r\ni=97 and then\nonly the Vairagya is lasting. Again and again you will have t=\r\no make enquiry.\nPhysical nudity and these external things will not constitu=\r\nte real Vairagya.\nReal Vairagya should come from enquiry, Vichara. All thes=\r\ne objects do not\ngive us lasting happiness. They lead us into pain and sorr=\r\now. Such deep\nenquiry, again and again, persisted in for a very long time, =\r\nproduces\nlasting Vairagya. It is the real wealth for an aspirant. It helps =\r\nhim to do\nreal Sadhana. It makes the mind introverted. This Vairagya puts a=\r\n break to\nthe extrovert tendency of the mind. Even if the mind runs towards=\r\n objects,\nat once it will point out that there is pain there, that sensual =\r\nenjoyment\nis the cause\nfor rebirth and intense suffering. So the mind is te=\r\nrribly afraid, and\ngradually through intense practice, it is established in=\r\n real, lasting,\nsustained, intense Vairagya.\n\nVairagya is of two kinds also=\r\n: Para Vairagya and Apara Vairagya. Para\nVairagya comes after one attains S=\r\nelf-realisation. The whole world then\nlooks like a straw. That is intense s=\r\npiritual strength. That is Para\nVairagya.\n\nWithout Vairagya there cannot be=\r\n any real spiritual progress. In Vedanta it\nis the only vital, fundamental =\r\nSadhana. If you have Vairagya, all other\nvirtues will come by themselves. P=\r\natanjali Maharshi says &quot;Abhyaasa\nvairaagyaabhyaam tan nirodhah&quot;=97&quot;The mind=\r\n is controlled by meditation or\nSadhana and Vairagya.&quot; They are the two win=\r\ngs of the aspirant to soar high\ninto the realm of Immortal Abode. The same =\r\nthing Lord Krishna also says.\n&quot;Abhyasena tu Kaunteya, vairagyena cha grihya=\r\nte&quot;=97&quot;The mind is controlled by\npractice and Vairagya, dispassion, intense=\r\n detachment.&quot; By Vairagya, the\nmind is detached. He who works in a detached=\r\n way is not bound by Karma. So\nit is aspirants&#39; duty to cultivate this one =\r\nvirtue, or Sadhana-anka,\nVairagya.\n\nVairagya is doubtless a mental state wh=\r\nerein the mind does not run into\nsensual grooves. It moves towards Atma, to=\r\nwards God. Queen Chudalai ruled a\nkingdom, and yet she had absolute Para Va=\r\niragya. Even amidst the temptations\nof the world, she had mental Vairagya t=\r\nhrough Vichar and wisdom. So she was\nnot affected in the least by the attra=\r\nctive objects of the world, even\nthough she ruled a kingdom; whereas her hu=\r\nsband, Sikhidhwaja, went to the\nforest renouncing his kingdom, yet he was n=\r\not established in Vairagya. He\nwas attached to the body, he was attached to=\r\n his Kamandalu. A man may be\nattached to any one object.\n\nYou see a Vairagi=\r\n. His whole body is smeared with ash, but he will fight for\na rupee if he f=\r\ninds you giving a rupee to another Vairagi. This is his\nmental state. So by=\r\n external appearance you cannot tell that one has\nVairagya. Vairagya is a m=\r\nental state. Sri Ramanuja does not belong to this\nextreme type of Vairagya=\r\n=97wearing only a rope around the waist. He was amidst\nluxurious things, bu=\r\nt his mind was not polluted. He had that mental state of\nVairagya, detachme=\r\nnt, indifference, born of Viveka.\n\nLord Krishna says that He is not in favo=\r\nur of extreme asceticism.\n&quot;Karshayantah sareerastham bhootagramamachetas ah=\r\n, mam chaivantassareerast\nham tan vidhyasuranischayan .&quot;=97&quot;They torture al=\r\nl the elements in the body\nand Me also who dwells in the body.&quot; Lord Buddha=\r\n also tortured his body, and\nlater on he found out that there was not much =\r\nspiritual progress; and then\nhe came to the golden medium, the middle path.=\r\n So we should go by the middle\npath always. The body is an instrument for a=\r\nttaining Self-realisation.\nEspecially in this Kali Yuga, Prana lives in the=\r\n bones. So you should not\ntorture the body. Whatever is needed for the body=\r\n you should have. You\nshould not expose the body to chill. God has given co=\r\nmmon sense. So you\nshould practise &quot;common sense Sadhana&quot;. There is no harm=\r\n in taking good,\nhealthy food. Every man has got a different physical const=\r\nitution. You\nshould use common sense in your Sadhana. If you are weak and i=\r\nf you cannot\nsit for a long\ntime in one Asan, you can take a little Chyavan=\r\naprash or some fruits. You\nshould have extreme or &quot;Teevra&quot; Vairagya interna=\r\nlly and at the same time\nfollow the middle path externally.\n\nGenerally, asp=\r\nirants say: &quot;I have given up umbrella.&quot;=85 &quot;I take only one\nmeal.&quot; Their wh=\r\nole Sadhana is: &quot;I have given up shirt.&quot;=85 &quot;I have given up\nsweater.&quot;=85 &quot;=\r\nI have given up shoes.&quot;=85 &quot;I live only on bread and dhal.&quot; Their\nSadhana c=\r\nonsists in &quot;giving up&quot;=97give up this, give up that. Real spiritual\nlife do=\r\nes not involve any giving up or taking. There is no giving up or\ntaking. Th=\r\ne only thing is, you should not give leniency to the mind. If you\nare very =\r\nhungry in the morning, take one or two iddalies and a small cup of\nmilk. Va=\r\niragya is a mental state. But do not give leniency to the mind. It\nwill hur=\r\nl you down. Always be watchful. Be eternally vigilant.\n\nAt the present mome=\r\nnt, there is Swami Krishnananda in Gangotri. He is a\ngreat Vairagi. For the=\r\n last so many years he is living without clothing in\nthe icy region and he =\r\nsleeps over the ice sometimes. Rai Bahadur Modi gave a\nvery good descriptio=\r\nn of him, sleeping on the ice. He found him to be a\nwonderful man and made =\r\nhim his Guru.\n\nAvadhoot Kesavananda is another Vairagi. He was living in Ri=\r\nshikesh. He was\nvery much liked by Malaviaji. He always slept on grass. Mal=\r\naviaji once took\nhim to Mussoorie. He refused to sleep on blanket. It was r=\r\naining, and\nMalaviaji had to bring grass for him to sleep. He was a Vairagi=\r\n. Vairagi is\na cult. Our Ram Kumar belongs to this cult. They put ash all o=\r\nver the body\nand make the hair look golden, and they wear a very thick rope=\r\n, of the size\nused for drawing chariots. This is Vairagya Sampradaya. In La=\r\nkshman Jhula\nthere is a Vairagi. They do Panchagni Tapas. They have got a p=\r\nhysical body.\n\nThere is another great Vairagi, our Sendamangalam Brahmendra=\r\n Swami. He lived\non Gomukha Vritti. He used to take food left in the leaves=\r\n that are thrown\nout by others after meals. &quot;Avadhootas&quot; are naked people. =\r\nThey have no\nclothing or home. Real Avadhoota is one who has shaved his min=\r\nd of all\nVasanas. When all Vasanas are destroyed, you will have Manolaya. B=\r\nrahmendra\nSwami lived a very austere life. He was Poornabodha&#39; s Guru and S=\r\nwami\nKrishnananda&#39; s Guru. Once in his Ashram, they prepared very good food=\r\n, and\nBrahmendra Swami ordered the food to be given to cows. He used to mak=\r\ne\nsevere tests. Sankarananda is also his disciple. He had a very strong bod=\r\ny\nand lived an austere life.\n\n------------ --------- ---\n\n`Light on Vairagy=\r\na&#39; will resume next week.\n\n\n\r\n--0015175885f65ea46504832d41e2\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;---------- Forwarded message ----------=\r\n&lt;br&gt;From: &lt;b class=3D&quot;gmail_sendername&quot;&gt;swamisuryadevananda&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span dir=\r\n=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:swamisuryadevananda@...&quot;&gt;swamisuryadev=\r\nananda@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nDate: Sat, Mar 27, 2010 at 2:59 PM&lt;br&gt;=\r\nSubject: [Courtesy CaribbeanHindu.net __ Sadhana Chatushtaya by Sri Swami S=\r\nivananda (Message 4)&lt;br&gt;To: &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:caribbeanhindus@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom&quot;&gt;caribbeanhindus@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-=\r\nCOLOR: #fff&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;SADHANA CHATUSHTAYA BY SRI SWAMI SIVANAN=\r\nDA (MESSAGE 4)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vairagya, or Dispassion, now continues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;------=\r\n------ --------- ---&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unnecessary torture of the body in the name of =\r\nTapas is highly deprecable. This is Asuric Tapas of ignorant persons. This =\r\nis condemned by Lord Krishna in the Gita. Body is the moving temple of the =\r\nLord. It is an instrument for Self-realisation. You cannot do any Sadhana i=\r\nf the body is not kept strong and healthy. Attachment to Vairagya is as muc=\r\nh an evil as attachment to sensual objects. Give up Vairagya-Abhimana. This=\r\n Abhimana of Sadhus and Sannyasins is more dangerous and inveterate than th=\r\ne Abhimana of worldly persons.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Vairagya-Abhimana is a deadly canke=\r\nr. It is difficult to get rid of the Vairagya- Abhimana as long as there is=\r\n the body-idea. The feeling, &quot;I am a great Vairagi or Thyagi&quot; is =\r\nVairagya Abhimana. The body of a Sannyasi, who has dedicated it unto the se=\r\nrvice of humanity, is a public property. He has no claim on it because he d=\r\nenies the existence of body and tries to feel always: &quot;I am Siva (Sivo=\r\nham)&quot;. The public will take care of his body.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Lord Buddha tor=\r\ntured the body, did severe austerities, gave up food and yet he was not abl=\r\ne to attain the goal. He heard the song:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Fair goes the dancing=\r\n when the Sitar&#39;s tuned, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tune us the Sitar neither low nor high=\r\n. &lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;And we will dance away the hearts of men &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The string o&#=\r\n39;erstretched breaks and the music flies,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The string o&#39;erslack =\r\nis dumb and music dies, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tune us the Sitar neither low nor high.&quo=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Then he ate food, adopted the middle path and succeeded in achi=\r\neving Nirvana. Extreme asceticism is not at all necessary for attaining per=\r\nfection. What is wanted is strong mental Vairagya born of strong discrimina=\r\ntion. All bodies are not fit for the practice of severe austerities. The bo=\r\ndy will drop down if you tax it too much by way of rigid Tapas. Do not spoi=\r\nl your health and body in the name of Tapas. Have a strong, healthy body, b=\r\nut have no attachment for the body. Be prepared to give it up at any time f=\r\nor a noble cause.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The care-taker of the horse feeds it with proper=\r\n nutrition when it is over-worked, when it is ailing. Then only it is ready=\r\n for further work. Even so, this body should be injected with proper nutrit=\r\nion. Then only it will turn out good work. Then only it will soon regain it=\r\ns lost vitality on account of overwork or ailment. Work will suffer if the =\r\nbody is not well attended to. When the body grows old it must be well-prote=\r\ncted against cold and well-looked after. If hard Titiksha is practised now,=\r\n it will give way soon. Consequently, the other shore of immortality and fe=\r\narlessness cannot be reached.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;O Ram, neglect not this body. The so=\r\nciety and Prakriti will extract and continue to extract as much work as pos=\r\nsible from those selfless workers who have dedicated their lives to the ser=\r\nvice of humanity. They are yoked to service till the last breath leaves the=\r\nir bodies. Lord Vishnu instructs Prahlada, &quot;My dear Prahlada! Enough o=\r\nf your Tapas. Take care of your body. Rise from your Samadhi. Serve people =\r\nnow. Disseminate Bhakti far and wide.&quot; Yoga Vasishtha speaks of one as=\r\n a &quot;Maha Tyagi&quot; and &quot;Maha Bhogi&quot;, who has renounced the=\r\n idea of &quot;I am a Tyagi&quot; and &quot;I am a Vairagi&quot;, who neith=\r\ner accepts nor rejects things that come by themselves by identifying himsel=\r\nf with the silent witness, the Immortal Atma, who feels always &quot;I am A=\r\nkarta (non-doer)&quot;, &quot;I am Abhokta (non-enjoyer) &quot; even while =\r\nmoving amidst objects. The Gita says, &quot;But the disciplined self, movin=\r\ng among sense-objects, with senses free from attraction and repulsion maste=\r\nred by the Self, goeth to&lt;br&gt;\n\nPeace.&quot; Chapter II-64.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some neop=\r\nhytes and raw aspirants pose themselves for &quot;Maha Tyagins&quot; or &qu=\r\not;Maha Bhogins&quot; and quote scriptures also: &quot;We eat without tongu=\r\nes; we see without eyes&quot;. The thief or the hypocrite will be found out=\r\n soon. They are just like the people who catch fishes from the Ganges to sa=\r\ntisfy their palates and quote Gita:=97&quot;Nainam Chhindanti Sastrani Nain=\r\nam Dahati Pavakah; Na chainam Kledayantyapo na sosha-yati marutah&quot;=97&=\r\nquot;Weapons cleave him not, nor fire burneth him, nor waters wet him, nor =\r\nwind drieth him away&quot;. Sublime philosophy indeed of perverted people w=\r\nith perverted intellects! The gilted ornaments cannot shine for a long time=\r\n. The crow that shines under borrowed feathers of the peacock will be found=\r\n out soon. Their Trishnas and Vasanas will burst out and any lay bystander =\r\ncan detect the hypocrite without difficulty.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;A Maha Tyagi or Maha =\r\nBhogi will not refuse to accept some mangoes or a cup of milk when they com=\r\ne by themselves. But he will not crave for them. He will not say, &quot;I h=\r\nave enjoyed today good mangoes or good milk.&quot; If an aspirant is seriou=\r\nsly ailing, if he is not able to eat solid food-stuffs, if there is a feeli=\r\nng of want in him for milk, if he has no money with him to purchase milk, i=\r\nf any devotee casually offers of his own accord some milk, he should not re=\r\nfuse it. God works mysteriously. He takes care of his devotees by working t=\r\nhrough the minds of various persons.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The child sometimes eats food=\r\n at night while he is sleeping. If the mother asks the child in the morning=\r\n. &quot;Baby, you took food last night,&quot; he replies, &quot;I have not =\r\ntaken anything last night. You are playing and joking with me.&quot; Such i=\r\ns the condition of a Jeevanmukta, or a Maha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi. He eats an=\r\nd yet he does not eat. He eats without a mouth and smells without a nose. S=\r\nometimes a man talks at night when he dreams. If you ask him when he comes =\r\nto waking consciousness, &quot;O Prema! Do you know that you talked last ni=\r\nght when you were dreaming?&quot; He replies &quot;I do not remember anythi=\r\nng.&quot; Such is the state of a Jeevanmukta or a Maha Tyagi and Maha Bhogi=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Durvasa ate a sumptuous meal and yet he said, &quot;I am a Nitya=\r\n Upavasi. I do not eat anything. I take grass juice only&quot;, because he =\r\nidentified himself with the Atma who is always the witness and the non-enjo=\r\nyer. Lord Krishna is regarded as a Nitya Brahmachari though he was with Rad=\r\nha, Rukmini and Satyabhama. Sage Tiruvalluvar said to his wife, &quot;My be=\r\nloved! Say unto the river that my husband, a Nitya Brahmachari, has command=\r\ned you to give path of way. She will at once yield and you can cross it wit=\r\nhout a boat.&quot; She repeated the words of her husband and crossed the ri=\r\nver immediately. She was quite amazed at the words of her husband and asked=\r\n him, &quot;My Lord! You are living with me and yet you say that you are a =\r\nNitya Brahmachari. I am struck with wonder. I am puzzled. Kindly explain th=\r\nis philosophy.&quot; Tiruvalluvar replied, &quot;I am immortal Atma. I have=\r\n realised this through direct cognition (Anubhava). I do not do anything. I=\r\n am the silent witness. The senses,&lt;br&gt;\n\nbody, mind and intellect are my in=\r\nstruments. I am entirely distinct from them.&quot; Tiruvalluvai&#39; s wife=\r\n understood the nature of the soul and then she became silent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ordin=\r\nary aspirants with delicate health should not take recourse to the practice=\r\n of drastic austerities. He who has attained Kaya Siddhi can do any kind of=\r\n Tapas because his body is adamantine. If an aspirant with delicate health =\r\ngives up food and tries to live on neem leaves alone, the obvious result is=\r\n that he will get various sorts of gastro-intestinal diseases and pass away=\r\n soon. This is the fruit obtained by persons who practise Tamasic Tapas.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;If you have mastery over the pair of opposites, viz., heat and cold,=\r\n if you can bear intense heat and intense cold, if you can remain without c=\r\nlothing in the icy Gangotri, this is highly creditable indeed. But if your =\r\nframe is delicate, if you attempt to stand before the sun in summer for som=\r\ne hours, if you throw off your clothing in the Gangotri all at once, you wi=\r\nll die immediately of sunstroke or pneumonia. You should not attempt to tak=\r\ne recourse to these hard practices. What little you will gain by Japa and m=\r\neditation in this birth will be lost, and you have lost one chance given by=\r\n the Lord in this birth to reach him by your foolish practices or Tamasic T=\r\napas.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;An aspirant gave up his clothing all at once. He developed r=\r\nheumatism, malaria, enlarged spleen and died within a short time. During th=\r\ne period of sickness all cravings that were temporarily suppressed asserted=\r\n themselves with re-doubled force. He became a slave of the tongue. He crav=\r\ned for many varieties of food. He could not suppress them. He ate indiscrim=\r\ninately and died of acute diarrhoea.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;An aspirant said, &quot;I hav=\r\ne not realised the Self though I did meditation for some years. I am going =\r\nto commit suicide with the Bhava, &quot;I am immortal Atma&quot;. I have go=\r\nt full Vairagya. No sin will cling to me, because my motive is pure. I will=\r\n attain self-realisation. &quot; He actually committed the abominable act. =\r\nDo you find such a statement anywhere in the scriptures? Certainly not. Thi=\r\ns is extreme foolishness. Some aspirants who have no idea of the nature of =\r\ntrue Vairagya, who have not lived under the guidance of their masters for s=\r\nome time, commit such ignoble acts. They can never get salvation by taking =\r\nto wrong Tapas though their Bhava (motive) may be pure. They cannot enterta=\r\nin the Bhava &quot;I am Atma&quot; just at the time of committing the act. =\r\nHorrible thoughts will crowd at the critical juncture. They will have to sh=\r\nare obviously the fate of Pretas (ghosts).&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The mind should gradual=\r\nly be weaned off its old habits and cravings. If you cut off all at once it=\r\ns pleasure centres, it will get puzzled. That is the reason why young aspir=\r\nants who take to too much Vairagya commit the ignoble act of committing sui=\r\ncide. You should train the mind in meditation gradually and make it taste t=\r\nhe inner bliss. Gradually it will leave off its old habits and old cravings=\r\n and you can get yourself established in true Vairagya.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The more t=\r\nhe Viveka, the more the true Vairagya. The flower of Vairagya gradually gro=\r\nws in the garden of Antahkarana from the understanding that the world is a =\r\nmere appearance and full of miseries and that Brahman alone is the only rea=\r\nlity full of knowledge and bliss, and through continued practice of meditat=\r\nion and association with the realised souls for a protracted period. Eventu=\r\nally, all objects of the world appear before the dispassionate soul as trif=\r\nling or worthless things. He will not give up his new spiritual life even i=\r\nf the wealth of the whole world is offered to him.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Aspirants shoul=\r\nd give up those articles of food which they like best for some time. They s=\r\nhould discipline all the Indriyas in a perfect manner. They should always l=\r\nead a simple life. They should always eat simple food. But they should not =\r\nbecome slaves of Vairagya. Abhiman Vairagya is a mental state. The Lord inf=\r\nuses this in his devotees in order to get rid of the clinging to sensual ob=\r\njects.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;May you all become Maha Tyagins and Maha Bhogis! May you al=\r\nl be free from the canker of Vairagya Abhimana!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;May you all possess =\r\ntrue lasting Para Vairagya!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;May you all attain Kaivalya or perfecti=\r\non!! !&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Real Vairagya&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was a Sannyasi at Benares. He wa=\r\ns a great Titikshu. He could bear heat and cold. In summer he used to stand=\r\n in the sun for some hours. In winter he used to stand in the Ganges for so=\r\nme hours. He used to sleep on a bed of grass. He shunned wooden cots.&lt;br&gt;\n\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;On one occasion one of his admirers, Sri Ram, took him to Mussoorie. Sr=\r\ni Ram provided him a cot to sleep. The Sannyasi refused to sleep on the cot=\r\n. He asked him to provide a bed of grass. There was much rain on that day. =\r\nIt was extremely difficult for him to get grass. Anyhow, Sri Ram managed to=\r\n get for the Swami a bed of grass with great difficulty.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Sri Ram s=\r\naid: &quot;Swamiji, it is very difficult to get grass here. It is raining n=\r\now in torrents. Kindly use the cot today. This will not bind you in any way=\r\n. You are an advanced Sannyasi. What is it for you whether the body lies on=\r\n a bed of grass or on a cot?&quot; The Swamiji replied &quot;No, no, no. I =\r\nmust have my usual bed of grass only. You must bring it anyhow.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;Attachment to Vairagya is as much an evil as attachment itself. Vairagy=\r\na is a means for attaining wisdom of the Self. It is not the goal itself. A=\r\n Jeevanmukta or realised sage has neither Raga nor Vairagya. If you give hi=\r\nm a little dry bread alone, he is quite satisfied. He will not grumble. If =\r\nyou give him best sweetmeats, milk and fruits, he will not refuse, but he w=\r\nill not be elated by good food. He always takes delight in his own Self onl=\r\ny, but not in external objects. This is the test to find out whether a man =\r\nhas attained realisation or not. A worldly man is much troubled when he can=\r\nnot get the right kind of food which he likes best. He rejoices when he obt=\r\nains palatable dishes. A realised soul has equanimity of mind. He is above =\r\nlikes and dislikes.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Suka Deva was tested by Raja Janaka. He remain=\r\ned without food at the gate for some days. He was quite peaceful. Then he w=\r\nas taken to the harem. Ranees served him and gave him best food. He remaine=\r\nd unaffected. This is wisdom.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Obviously, the Swami who wanted a be=\r\nd of grass at Mussoorie had not attained equanimity of mind and Self-realis=\r\nation. He was attached to Vairagya even after several years of spiritual pr=\r\nactice. He was not completely free from all sorts of attachments because he=\r\n was attached to Vairagya. He did not attain Sahaja-Avastha or natural stat=\r\ne wherein the Sage is quite indifferent to all kinds of objects, wherein th=\r\ne sage would sleep on the bed of grass or a beautiful cot with mattress and=\r\n pillow with the same feeling.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;He who is endowed with equanimity o=\r\nf mind towards objects is called a Maha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi in Yoga Vasisht=\r\nha. It is easy to practise Vairagya, but it is extremely difficult to keep =\r\nthe evenness of mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some Sannyasins who are working for the public=\r\n good make resolves: &quot;We will not travel in trains. We will walk only.=\r\n We will not take milk, fruits, etc. We will not use fountain pens or watch=\r\n.&quot; These are not desirable resolves. This is not the real nature of Va=\r\niragya. They are also attached to Vairagya. This is another kind of defect.=\r\n They want to do service. If they move in cars or trains, if they keep the =\r\nbody strong and healthy, they can do more service in a short space of time.=\r\n Those who do much writing-work can turn out much work if they use a founta=\r\nin pen. Foolishness assumes various forms. This is one kind. It does not le=\r\nave even educated persons or cultured Sannyasins.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Some Sannyasins =\r\npractise Vairagya in order to gat Pratishta or fame and respect. But God kn=\r\nows the motives of all, as He is the Antaryami or inner Ruler. You cannot d=\r\neceive Him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where is the strength of Vairagya when one lives in secl=\r\nusion, where there is no temptation? Where is the strength of Vairagya when=\r\n one has not renounced anything, when he has nothing to renounce, when he h=\r\nas not enjoyed the objects of the world, when there is no attraction in the=\r\n mind for the objects of the world even though he shows externally that he =\r\nis a great Virakta or dispassionate man by putting on a gunny bag or keepin=\r\ng a small wooden bowl only in his hand?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Raja Janaka was amidst reg=\r\nal enjoyments. People reported that the city of Mithila was burst and yet, =\r\nhe was not a bit affected. That is real Vairagya. He alone can be called a =\r\nreal great Virakta.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Young aspirants should be very careful and cauti=\r\nous. They should not take advantage of the liberty of a Maha Tyagi and a Ma=\r\nha Bhogi. This can be practised only by an advanced Yogi who has got equal =\r\nvision over all beings. Beginners should stick to their resolves of Truth, =\r\nAhimsa, Brahmacharya and Vairagya to the very letter and spirit.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;M=\r\nay you all transcend Raga and Vairagya and attain knowledge of the Self. Ma=\r\ny you all understand the true nature and Swaroopa of Vairagya.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vaira=\r\ngya is the rein by which the uncontrollable mind is restrained. Ripe Vairag=\r\nya is intense attachment to Atmic bliss and strong dispassion for anything =\r\nother than Atma.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;If one considers the position and happiness of Br=\r\nahma even as the dung of a cow, then only he has developed a real lasting V=\r\nairagya. Temporary fleeting dispassion is not Vairagya. It will not help th=\r\ne aspirant in the attainment of Self-realisation.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It is common to =\r\nhave dispassion for some particular objects by some cause or other. But by =\r\nhaving dispassion for all objects at all times, one will get knowledge of t=\r\nhe Self. You may get Atma-Jnana soon by the grace of the Guru, by devotion =\r\nto him, and by practice of what he instructs.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Do not fall a victim=\r\n of Moha even if you happen to move in towns with young and well-adored fas=\r\nhionable ladies of high civilised societies. Resolve to attain Self-realisa=\r\ntion. The Tamoguna will vanish of its own accord.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Devotion, dispas=\r\nsion and knowledge of Atma are the three means of salvation. Dispassion is =\r\ndesirelessness This All-full Atma resides in the chambers of the heart and =\r\nso everybody has this Atma.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Light on Vairagya&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Vairagya is b=\r\norn of Viveka, discrimination between Nitya and Anitya (eternal and non-ete=\r\nrnal) , Sat and Asat (real and unreal), Tattwa and Atattwa. Viveka comes th=\r\nrough disinterested selfless service done in several births and through Puj=\r\na and Aradhana, and through the Grace of the Lord. From Viveka is born Vair=\r\nagya. It gives spiritual strength.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;A man of Vairagya has no attrac=\r\ntion for the world. It is like a straw. So Vairagya is a supreme, inexhaust=\r\nible wealth for aspirants. Vairagya produces concentration of mind, Samadha=\r\nna, and generates burning Mumukshutwa, strong yearning for Liberation or Em=\r\nancipation, or Release.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Raga is attachment to objects. Wherever th=\r\nere is a little pleasure, there is Raga. Wherever there is pain, there is d=\r\nislike. Like and dislike are one. Raga-Dwesha is also one of the important =\r\nafflictions, according to Patanjali Maharshi. The five afflictions are: Avi=\r\ndya (ignorance), Asmita (egoism), Raga-Dwesha (like and dislike and Abhiniv=\r\nesha (clinging to life). First, there is ignorance, the original Avidya. Fr=\r\nom this is born egoism, Asmita, and from Asmita is born Raga-Dwesha, and fr=\r\nom Raga-Dwesha, Abhinivesha, the clinging to this life.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Vairagya i=\r\ns of different types or degrees=97Mridu, Madhyama and Teevra (mild, moderat=\r\ne and intense). Intense Vairagya only will help the aspirant to stick to th=\r\nis path. If it is of a dull type like Smasana Vairagya or Prasava Vairagya,=\r\n the mind will simply be waiting to get back the objects that were renounce=\r\nd previously, and the aspirant will get a downfall. He will not be able to =\r\nclimb again to the heights he formerly reached. So aspirants should be care=\r\nful. Even though the Vairagya is of a mild type, they should try to make it=\r\n moderate; and then intense Vairagya comes through looking into the defects=\r\n of sensual life. Sensual pleasure is not real happiness. It is illusory, t=\r\nransient, impermanent. It is mixed with pain. So again and again by looking=\r\n into the defects of sensual life, Vairagya dawns. It should be strengthene=\r\nd through study of spiritual books, Satsanga, Vichara and enquiry.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;Simply living in nudity and eating neem leaves, and drinking cow&#39;s uri=\r\nne does not constitute real Vairagya. Vairagya should be born of discrimina=\r\ntion, enquiry and Vichara. By these, the mind is weaned from sensual enjoym=\r\nents and rendered thin like a thread=97Thanumanasi=97 and then only the Vai=\r\nragya is lasting. Again and again you will have to make enquiry. Physical n=\r\nudity and these external things will not constitute real Vairagya. Real Vai=\r\nragya should come from enquiry, Vichara. All these objects do not give us l=\r\nasting happiness. They lead us into pain and sorrow. Such deep enquiry, aga=\r\nin and again, persisted in for a very long time, produces lasting Vairagya.=\r\n It is the real wealth for an aspirant. It helps him to do real Sadhana. It=\r\n makes the mind introverted. This Vairagya puts a break to the extrovert te=\r\nndency of the mind. Even if the mind runs towards objects, at once it will =\r\npoint out that there is pain there, that sensual enjoyment is the cause&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\nfor rebirth and intense suffering. So the mind is terribly afraid, and gr=\r\nadually through intense practice, it is established in real, lasting, susta=\r\nined, intense Vairagya.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vairagya is of two kinds also: Para Vairagya=\r\n and Apara Vairagya. Para Vairagya comes after one attains Self-realisation=\r\n. The whole world then looks like a straw. That is intense spiritual streng=\r\nth. That is Para Vairagya.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Without Vairagya there cannot be any re=\r\nal spiritual progress. In Vedanta it is the only vital, fundamental Sadhana=\r\n. If you have Vairagya, all other virtues will come by themselves. Patanjal=\r\ni Maharshi says &quot;Abhyaasa vairaagyaabhyaam tan nirodhah&quot;=97&quot;=\r\nThe mind is controlled by meditation or Sadhana and Vairagya.&quot; They ar=\r\ne the two wings of the aspirant to soar high into the realm of Immortal Abo=\r\nde. The same thing Lord Krishna also says. &quot;Abhyasena tu Kaunteya, vai=\r\nragyena cha grihyate&quot;=97&quot;The mind is controlled by practice and V=\r\nairagya, dispassion, intense detachment.&quot; By Vairagya, the mind is det=\r\nached. He who works in a detached way is not bound by Karma. So it is aspir=\r\nants&#39; duty to cultivate this one virtue, or Sadhana-anka, Vairagya.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;Vairagya is doubtless a mental state wherein the mind does not run in=\r\nto sensual grooves. It moves towards Atma, towards God. Queen Chudalai rule=\r\nd a kingdom, and yet she had absolute Para Vairagya. Even amidst the tempta=\r\ntions of the world, she had mental Vairagya through Vichar and wisdom. So s=\r\nhe was not affected in the least by the attractive objects of the world, ev=\r\nen though she ruled a kingdom; whereas her husband, Sikhidhwaja, went to th=\r\ne forest renouncing his kingdom, yet he was not established in Vairagya. He=\r\n was attached to the body, he was attached to his Kamandalu. A man may be a=\r\nttached to any one object.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;You see a Vairagi. His whole body is sm=\r\neared with ash, but he will fight for a rupee if he finds you giving a rupe=\r\ne to another Vairagi. This is his mental state. So by external appearance y=\r\nou cannot tell that one has Vairagya. Vairagya is a mental state. Sri Raman=\r\nuja does not belong to this extreme type of Vairagya=97wearing only a rope =\r\naround the waist. He was amidst luxurious things, but his mind was not poll=\r\nuted. He had that mental state of Vairagya, detachment, indifference, born =\r\nof Viveka.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Lord Krishna says that He is not in favour of extreme a=\r\nsceticism. &quot;Karshayantah sareerastham bhootagramamachetas ah, mam chai=\r\nvantassareerast ham tan vidhyasuranischayan .&quot;=97&quot;They torture al=\r\nl the elements in the body and Me also who dwells in the body.&quot; Lord B=\r\nuddha also tortured his body, and later on he found out that there was not =\r\nmuch spiritual progress; and then he came to the golden medium, the middle =\r\npath. So we should go by the middle path always. The body is an instrument =\r\nfor attaining Self-realisation. Especially in this Kali Yuga, Prana lives i=\r\nn the bones. So you should not torture the body. Whatever is needed for the=\r\n body you should have. You should not expose the body to chill. God has giv=\r\nen common sense. So you should practise &quot;common sense Sadhana&quot;. T=\r\nhere is no harm in taking good, healthy food. Every man has got a different=\r\n physical constitution. You should use common sense in your Sadhana. If you=\r\n are weak and if you cannot sit for a long&lt;br&gt;\n\ntime in one Asan, you can t=\r\nake a little Chyavanaprash or some fruits. You should have extreme or &quot=\r\n;Teevra&quot; Vairagya internally and at the same time follow the middle pa=\r\nth externally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Generally, aspirants say: &quot;I have given up umbre=\r\nlla.&quot;=85 &quot;I take only one meal.&quot; Their whole Sadhana is: &qu=\r\not;I have given up shirt.&quot;=85 &quot;I have given up sweater.&quot;=85 =\r\n&quot;I have given up shoes.&quot;=85 &quot;I live only on bread and dhal.&=\r\nquot; Their Sadhana consists in &quot;giving up&quot;=97give up this, give =\r\nup that. Real spiritual life does not involve any giving up or taking. Ther=\r\ne is no giving up or taking. The only thing is, you should not give lenienc=\r\ny to the mind. If you are very hungry in the morning, take one or two iddal=\r\nies and a small cup of milk. Vairagya is a mental state. But do not give le=\r\nniency to the mind. It will hurl you down. Always be watchful. Be eternally=\r\n vigilant.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;At the present moment, there is Swami Krishnananda in G=\r\nangotri. He is a great Vairagi. For the last so many years he is living wit=\r\nhout clothing in the icy region and he sleeps over the ice sometimes. Rai B=\r\nahadur Modi gave a very good description of him, sleeping on the ice. He fo=\r\nund him to be a wonderful man and made him his Guru.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Avadhoot Kesa=\r\nvananda is another Vairagi. He was living in Rishikesh. He was very much li=\r\nked by Malaviaji. He always slept on grass. Malaviaji once took him to Muss=\r\noorie. He refused to sleep on blanket. It was raining, and Malaviaji had to=\r\n bring grass for him to sleep. He was a Vairagi. Vairagi is a cult. Our Ram=\r\n Kumar belongs to this cult. They put ash all over the body and make the ha=\r\nir look golden, and they wear a very thick rope, of the size used for drawi=\r\nng chariots. This is Vairagya Sampradaya. In Lakshman Jhula there is a Vair=\r\nagi. They do Panchagni Tapas. They have got a physical body.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;There=\r\n is another great Vairagi, our Sendamangalam Brahmendra Swami. He lived on =\r\nGomukha Vritti. He used to take food left in the leaves that are thrown out=\r\n by others after meals. &quot;Avadhootas&quot; are naked people. They have =\r\nno clothing or home. Real Avadhoota is one who has shaved his mind of all V=\r\nasanas. When all Vasanas are destroyed, you will have Manolaya. Brahmendra =\r\nSwami lived a very austere life. He was Poornabodha&#39; s Guru and Swami K=\r\nrishnananda&#39; s Guru. Once in his Ashram, they prepared very good food, =\r\nand Brahmendra Swami ordered the food to be given to cows. He used to make =\r\nsevere tests. Sankarananda is also his disciple. He had a very strong body =\r\nand lived an austere life.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;------------ --------- ---&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;`Ligh=\r\nt on Vairagya&#39; will resume next week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;M=\r\nIN-HEIGHT: 0px; COLOR: #fff&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--0015175885f65ea46504832d41e2--\r\n\n"}}
