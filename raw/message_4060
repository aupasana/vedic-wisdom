None of my neighbors is, to my knowledge at l=\r\neast, Hindu.  \n\nDoes the homam create a fair amount of smoke and/or odor?  =\r\n(I would of course disconnect my fire alarm, it goes off when I am cooking =\r\nsometimes!)  Would it be best done indoors or out of doors, given my situat=\r\nion?  I am thinking of buying some sort of stone or ceramic slab to put the=\r\n kundam onto just to be safe in I do it indoors (rather than just the woode=\r\nn plank suggested in the instructions).\n\nAlso, would I need to memorize the=\r\n Sanskrit invocations and the procedure, or would using a printed copy of t=\r\nhe instructions be acceptable?  I obviously would want to do the former eve=\r\nntually, but is the latter ok when just starting out?\n\nJust a few questions=\r\n to start with.  As I said previously, it may be a while before I am ready =\r\nto perform the homam, but just thinking ahead and making preparations!\n\n-- =\r\nDavyd\n\n\n\n"}}
