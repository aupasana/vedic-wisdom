I am quoti=\r\nng just my comments. One should be able to follow them despite the missing =\r\ncontext.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nWriting 1:=\r\n\n=A0\nI have no aversion for Vedanta at all, but many Vedantins today only s=\r\npeak pseudo-Vedanta that is devoid of a respect for what binds us in the fi=\r\nrst place and a genuine appreciation of the difficulty of overcoming the bo=\r\nndage. Let us dissect this &quot;acceptance&quot; thing for example. Yes, it is very =\r\neasy to theoretically understand that &quot;acceptance of everything&quot; will liber=\r\nate one. But what does it mean practically?\n\nFor example, I read your note =\r\nand my instinct was to respond. Should I &quot;accept&quot; the instinct and type thi=\r\ns response? Or should I &quot;accept&quot; the other instinct to not waste time and c=\r\nontinue with some Jyotish research work I was doing? Which acceptance is be=\r\ntter?\n\nWe are constantly pulled in different directions by our dharma towar=\r\nds different beings/entities and it is not easy to pick the right thing to =\r\ndo.\n\nWe can use an easy abstraction. Let us call our actions towards the re=\r\nst of the world as &quot;karma&quot; and the actions of the rest of the world towards=\r\n us as &quot;karmaphala&quot;. A simple thumb rule can be (1) to accept all &quot;karmapha=\r\nla&quot; and not analyze it much and (2) to stick to our dharma in picking the &quot;=\r\nkarma&quot;. But there are 3 fundamental issues with this:\n\n(1) It is not easy t=\r\no know one&#39;s dharma. One is often pulled in different directions by one&#39;s d=\r\nharma towards different beings/entities. After all, we are suspended in thi=\r\ns world by a complex web of rinas!\n(2) As we evaluate various dharmas and p=\r\nick current karma, some understanding of which karma is likely to result in=\r\n which karmaphala is needed. Thus, feedback from previous karmas, in the fo=\r\nrm of &quot;karmaphala&quot;, is of interest. But there is no certainty and we can on=\r\nly have a vague understanding.\n(3) Firmness in doing one&#39;s karma in the int=\r\nerest of one&#39;s highest dharma (based on one&#39;s best understanding at the tim=\r\ne - could be faulty) and detachment to the corresponding karmaphala when it=\r\n finally arrives, is what we have to do. But they are kind of opposite goal=\r\ns. Without some attachment, most people cannot engage in firm actions.\n\nMan=\r\ny Vedantins make 2 mistakes - (1) they trivialize the field of duality as s=\r\nomething that is delusional and can simply be wished away and (2) instead o=\r\nf seeing jnana and karma as two sides of the coin, they see them as alterna=\r\ntives. They look down upon karma as something lowly and value bookish & int=\r\nellectual understanding of jnana more. Without firm & dharmik karmas, that =\r\nintellectual understanding of jnana will not infuse one&#39;s thinking and inst=\r\nincts deep enough to liberate one eventually.\n\nI can see that &quot;sun of knowl=\r\nedge is so powerful that we cant even grasp the edge of it&#39;s toes with our =\r\nindriyas (sense-organs), hence you have to use some other faculty and remem=\r\nber that you cant also express it to others with your sense organs.&quot; But it=\r\n is very easy for one to delude oneself that one is now grasping that Sun w=\r\nith &quot;some other faculty&quot;. The proof of the pudding is that theoretical unde=\r\nrstanding is accompanied by an internal transformation that expresses exter=\r\nnally as firm dharmik karmas with detachment to karmaphala!!\n\nTo anyone who=\r\n lectures that all is Self/God, I just have one rude reply. Suppose one&#39;s h=\r\nands and legs are cut off. Can one say that the cut off limbs and the strea=\r\nm of blood flowing are also Self/God and be in the same blissful state? I k=\r\nnow the answer in my case. Any truthful person will know the answer in one&#39;=\r\ns own case. It is so easy to repeat Vedanta like a parrot, but Shakti is to=\r\no powerful. Unless MANY deeply ingrained instincts are overcome through pra=\r\nctice & grace, one cannot be liberated. Until one overcomes ALL instincts, =\r\n&quot;all is Self&quot; is just theory.\n\nRegarding Rajarshi&#39;s comment on there being =\r\nsomething higher than the upper bird in Mundakpanishad story, I don&#39;t have =\r\nmuch to say. It is quite possible. However, whether or what is above that b=\r\nird is not that interesting to me. When my personality is represented by th=\r\ne lower bird, my goal is to first make the lower bird climb and reach the u=\r\npper bird. Whether it stays there then or flies away further up is an issue=\r\n for future.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nWritin=\r\ng 2:\n=A0\nI do not want to &quot;put down&quot; Vedanta. I only want to put it in pers=\r\npective. It is the &quot;anta&quot; (end) of &quot;veda&quot; (knowledge). If one at the *begin=\r\nning* or *middle* of the path ignores/puts down the whole path and talks ex=\r\ncessively of the &quot;end&quot;, it does not necessarily take him to the end. It tak=\r\nes a loooong time to travel the path. Vedanta is just the end and not a pat=\r\nh to the end. IMHO, Vedanta is not only useless but quite misleading for 99=\r\n.9999% of humanity, though it is the inevitable final liberating reality fo=\r\nr the rest who already travelled *a* path and reached *the* end.\n\nTake the =\r\nsimple notion of acceptance. Rama, after Self-realization, killed Ravana an=\r\nd others. Of course, he had no &quot;dvesha&quot; for Ravana. But would you normally =\r\nlabel killing someone as &quot;acceptance&quot;? Understanding &quot;acceptance&quot; referred =\r\nto in scriptures is no easy task!!!! In fact, people talk about &quot;acceptance=\r\n&quot; without even fully understanding what it actually entails.\n\nWe perceive e=\r\nverything through the lens of conditioning/vasanas and rinas. For example, =\r\nmy words may make you think that I am agitated, even if I am quite &quot;chilled=\r\n&quot; in reality. Before talking about &quot;accepting&quot; something, shouldn&#39;t we firs=\r\nt improve one&#39;s perceptions? Can&#39;t questioning & contemplating help in clar=\r\nifying our perceptions?\n\nIs &quot;accepting&quot; faulty/conditioned notions in our m=\r\ninds any useful? Isn&#39;t it better to resist, reject and eject faulty/conditi=\r\noned notions than to &quot;accept&quot; them? Wouldn&#39;t progress from a state of ignor=\r\nance into that of wisdom naturally need a fine balance between friction/res=\r\nistance and acceptance?\n\nA prematurely adopted stretegy of &quot;accepting&quot; ever=\r\nything with no &quot;raaga&quot; or &quot;dvesha&quot; can lead to a confused and indecisive pe=\r\nrson who shuns his dharma and gets *stuck* in the middle of path despite sp=\r\neaking the language of someone who is at the end of the path. For someone w=\r\nho is still stuck in Maayaa, it is better to do somewhat selfless dharma ev=\r\nen with some raaga and dvesha. Overcoming of raaga and dvesha naturally and=\r\n organically occurs from within, as one engages in more and more dharma and=\r\n pays off more and more rinas.\n\nDetachment (disappearance of raaga and dves=\r\nha) comes with the maturing of jnana. Selfless dharmik actions that pay off=\r\n outstanding debts occur with the maturing of karma. These two sides should=\r\n mature together, as they balance one. If one goes to an extreme, either to=\r\nwards karma or jnana, without corresponding progress in the other, one will=\r\n very likely get stuck.\n=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & Sp=\r\nirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n--------\r\n--944242502-1718260893-1366559228=:77063\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ar=\r\nial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;Namaste friends,&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;A =\r\ncouple of my write-ups related to Vedanta on a limited access Facebook foru=\r\nm may be of interest to some people here.
