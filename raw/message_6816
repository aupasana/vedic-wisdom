These arguments are as good as the arguments =E2=80=\r\n=9Clike who is the \ncreator of world =E2=80=93 The Shakti Worshippers say I=\r\nts Devi, Vaishanavas Say its Maha \nVishnu, Shaivists say its Bhagvan Shiv o=\r\nr Shankar and Ganapatyas Say its Lord \nGanapati .. etc so  each sect of fol=\r\nlowers have their own conception or \npresumptions about the deities. So let=\r\n=E2=80=99s not over rule each others views. Their \nown believes are good fo=\r\nr them. If some of them (views) don=E2=80=99t apply to us let=E2=80=99s \nno=\r\nt take it but let=E2=80=99s not oppose others who are comfortable with it.\n=\r\nAnd its my personal view is that if we have full faith on whatever deity or=\r\n any \nsmall energy too then it can lead us to realization of ultimate which=\r\n is devoid \nof all gunas the initial gunas that are blamed (aropit =E2=80=\r\n=93 or arop) to them are \nimmaterial when realized in full.  \n\nHence the ab=\r\nove blamed =E2=80=9CTamasik=E2=80=9D tag does not applies to them, as- for =\r\nthe \nfollower of them they are saattvik only. And for your info if you need=\r\n any \ndetails of temples where these deities (above mentioned deities) are =\r\nconsidered \nand worshipped as saattvik deities I can assist you with same.\n=\r\n\nii) Are you saying that Tamasik deities cannot be or should not be worship=\r\nped in \nSaattvik ways?\nLet me say clearly that any deity can be worshipped =\r\nin any way as per the will \nand the strength of the bhakta or worshipper. T=\r\nhere are no hard and fast rules \nfor bhakti or worship.\nEvery =E2=80=9CSaat=\r\nvik=E2=80=9D (I would say tagged as saattvik) deity can be worshipped in \nT=\r\namasik or rajasik way and so is for rajasik or Tamasik deities. Whatever th=\r\ne \nway you worship them it is your bhakti and samarpana bhav that is going =\r\nto \nmatter and not what way you worship.\n \niii) You are saying that =E2=80=\r\n=9CTantra=E2=80=9D is Tamasik??? \nHere I think the real meaning or definiti=\r\non of tantra is not known. \nWe can say that what we call as the pooja or ho=\r\nma is also a type of tantra. \nThere is no bigger difference in tantra or po=\r\noja. The method followed is same \nwhere as the mantras and ingredients used=\r\n may vary depending on the worshipper \nor the deities or as per the path fo=\r\nllowed by the worshipper.\nIf you want an example of saattvik tantras: pleas=\r\ne go ahead and see the places \nwhere His holiness Shri Jagadguru Shankarach=\r\narya ji=E2=80=9D has installed =E2=80=9CShri=E2=80=9D \nChakras which are st=\r\nill being worshipped by respective matths with its chakra \npooja paddhhati =\r\n(And for your info all matths of shakaracharya ji follow Rig \nVeda as the p=\r\nrimary and though other Vedas also taught to the students, the \npooja kaink=\r\naryas are carried out as per the Rig Veda methods). \n\n \niv) About Tamasik p=\r\naths (or Vaama chara) following: methods of getting stronger \nby weakening =\r\nof enemies: \n\nThe ultimate goal of any path whether it is Saattvik or Tamas=\r\nik or Rajasik \nwhichever it is to realize the ultimate truth and there is n=\r\nothing that \nencourages harming other creatures for self benefit (Let me st=\r\nress the point \nthat =E2=80=93 there is no encouragement for harming any cr=\r\neature forget harming any \nperson or enemy. and it is quite clearly mention=\r\ned that  if anything like that \nis done then it carries burden of big karma=\r\n and instead of causing liberation it \nwill end up binding down the person =\r\nto earthly or below earthly life)\nThe point is if somebody misuses any genu=\r\nine knowledge then it is not fault of \nthat knowledge. But then for this mi=\r\nsuse, that knowledge is not to be blamed. \nAnd let me tell you very frankly=\r\n that any knowledge whether it is tagged as \nsaattvik or Tamasik or rajasik=\r\n can be misused in similar ways as it has been \nwith the so called =E2=80=\r\n=9CTamasik=E2=80=9D knowledge.\nAnd finally the meaning of weakening of enem=\r\nies does not mean the enemies who \nare in outside world but ones within us =\r\nthat are -Kama, krodha, lobha, moha, \nmada, matsara (The ari-shad-vairies)-=\r\n winning of which is important in order to \nmove towards the realization of=\r\n  ultimate. \n\n\n*****\nHope this helps for some extent.\n\n\n \nThanks & Regards,=\r\n\nChetan \n\n\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@c=\r\nharter.net&gt;\nTo: vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom; \nJyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Fri, 8 July, 2011 9:59:05 PM\nSubjec=\r\nt: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Shiva homam\n\n  \nNamaste,\n\n&gt; Is it fault of agni deva =\r\nthat someone write a tamasik Purana after his\n&gt; name?\n\nVeda Vyasa is not ju=\r\nst &quot;someone&quot;.\n\n&gt; Lord Vishnu is rajasik deity, he always sustains.\n\nCreatio=\r\nn/expansion is an activity of rajas.

When shown ample \nr=\r\neferences, you bemoaned that taamasik deities should not be worshipped \nwit=\r\nh saattwik methods and said homam to taamasik deities should include \n&quot;mens=\r\ntruation blood, meat, fish, alcohol&quot; etc. Now you are making them \nout to b=\r\ne demons.

We \nWILL enable people to =\r\nworship various deities (including Shiva!) in \nfire, in a saattwik manner.\n=\r\n\n&gt; Most straight forward way to worship a tamasik deity is through vaama\n&gt; =\r\nmaarga; this is the hard truth which is very difficult for you to\n&gt; digest.=\r\n Those who consume alcohol, fish  have already been initiated \n&gt; on\n&gt; to va=\r\nama marga.

Vaama maarga is about taking something considered impure and \nb=\r\neing able to actually view it as Brahman and not as a limited thing \nthat e=\r\nvokes attraction or aversion in mind.

If\n&gt;&gt; Agni (Fire!) Purana i=\r\ns not an acceptable reference for homam, I \n&gt;&gt; wonder\n&gt;&gt; what is!\n&gt;\n&gt; Is it=\r\n fault of agni deva that someone write a tamasik Purana after his\n&gt; name?\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; Second of all, the notion that some puranas are saattwik, some are\n&gt;&gt; r=\r\najasik and some are tamasik, was conjured by people who could not\n&gt;&gt; reconc=\r\nile apparent contradictions within different puranas. If one\n&gt;&gt; understands=\r\n the Upanishadic essence correctly, all contradictions \n&gt;&gt; fall\n&gt;&gt; in place=\r\n and all puranas are meaningful.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, yes keep on mixing what ever come=\r\n to you. I wonder that if you \n&gt; were\n&gt; present when devas and demons perfo=\r\nrm samundra manthan then you would\n&gt; have even mixed pots of amrita and vis=\r\nha to from your new recipe of\n&gt; disaster.\n&gt; Initially at the time of creati=\r\non lord divided potency into two entity\n&gt; which are solar and lunar also ca=\r\nlled Law of Two. Then he further\n&gt; divided it into three entities known as =\r\nsattva, rajas and tamas also\n&gt; known as law of Three. Then he further divid=\r\ned into four entities and \n&gt; so\n&gt; on. The fact that everything has emerged =\r\nfrom one entity known as \n&gt; Brahma\n&gt; is Law of One. Those who are intellect=\r\nually capable to understand \n&gt; this;\n&gt; for them their is no contradiction.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Upanishadic essence which you talked about but have never understand; \n=\r\n&gt; i\n&gt; have served it in your karma platter. Now be wise enough to digest it=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; There are primary two way of doing any sadhana, one is sattavic and=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; other is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tamasik also known as right handed and left handed paths.=\r\n Vedic\n&gt;&gt;&gt; philosophy is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; right handed and tantaric philosophy is left h=\r\nanded.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; All tantrik philosophy is NOT left handed. There are right han=\r\nded\n&gt;&gt; tantras as well as left handed tantras. You are totally off the mark=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; In your figment of imagination you have created your own world which =\r\n\n&gt; is\n&gt; based on your faulty knowledge which you have gained from goggling.=\r\n \n&gt; Come\n&gt; out of it and face the hard truths. Extraordinary people who ach=\r\nieve\n&gt; extraordinary spiritual, intellectual and material heights either ha=\r\nve\n&gt; followed complete right handed or complete left handed path. Nothing\n&gt;=\r\n great can be achieved but mixing both of them. Mixture is for general\n&gt; po=\r\npulace who will remain general, ordinary, insignificant and \n&gt; worthless\n&gt; =\r\nfor reaming part of their lives.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Do you consider Rudra, Durga and Chan=\r\ndi as &quot;taamasik deities&quot;? If I\n&gt; want\n&gt;&gt; to worship Rudra with Rudra Namaka=\r\n Prasna (from YajurVeda) or Durga\n&gt; with\n&gt;&gt; Durga Sooktam (from RigVeda) or=\r\n Chandi with Devi Sooktam (from\n&gt; RigVeda),\n&gt;&gt; are you suggesting that I sh=\r\nould do all of the above???!\n&gt;\n&gt; Why should i suggest you anything? You sho=\r\nuld read scriptures of your\n&gt; faith and try to understand it yourself and k=\r\nindly spare me with the\n&gt; horror of suggesting anything to you.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The ab=\r\nove is utter nonsense.\n&gt;&gt; It is saying that the only way to worship some fi=\r\nerce deities (let me\n&gt;&gt; use this term instead of tamasik deities) is throug=\r\nh vaama maarga\n&gt;&gt; (left-handed path). That is nonsense. Left-handed path is=\r\n for those\n&gt; who\n&gt;&gt; are already so pure that even meat, fish, alcohol and s=\r\nex do not\n&gt;&gt; distract one&#39;s focus from god and from the deep realization th=\r\nat\n&gt; &quot;sarvam\n&gt;&gt; khalvidam brahma&quot;. It is not for all. As Robert Svoboda cor=\r\nrectly \n&gt;&gt; says\n&gt;&gt; at the beginning of &quot;Aghora: At the left hand of god&quot;, m=\r\nost people \n&gt;&gt; who\n&gt;&gt; are attracted to this path for the kick are doomed to=\r\n fail and those\n&gt; who\n&gt;&gt; are pure enough for it are not attracted to it.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; Fierce deities such as Rudra, Durga, Chandi etc can be worshipped in \n&gt;=\r\n&gt; a\n&gt;&gt; saattwik manner also and THAT is better for MOST people.\n&gt;\n&gt; Most st=\r\nraight forward way to worship a tamasik deity is through vaama\n&gt; maarga; th=\r\nis is the hard truth which is very difficult for you to\n&gt; digest. Those who=\r\n consume alcohol, fish  have already been initiated \n&gt; on\n&gt; to vaama marga.=\r\n They have no other option left with them other then\n&gt; worshiping a tamasik=\r\n deity. Those people who consume alcohol and \n&gt; recite\n&gt; mantras of sattavi=\r\nk deities; disaster will fall upon then and they \n&gt; will\n&gt; soon loose all o=\r\nf their land, wealth and prestige. This is called\n&gt; spiritual and moral dec=\r\nay of the society. Same is the cause of the \n&gt; decay\n&gt; of India and firstly=\r\n mugals and then Britishers rules over us. Same \n&gt; kind\n&gt; of spiritual deca=\r\ny can be seen with Kashmire pundits and they also \n&gt; loose\n&gt; all of their l=\r\nands and homes and become refugees.\n&gt;\n&gt; Spiritual and moral decay of any so=\r\nciety is the reason of its fall.\n&gt; Those who can&#39;t stand firm on their dhar=\r\nma will fall. These are not my\n&gt; own views, read literature related to Aach=\r\nyara Chanakya.\n&gt;\n&gt; Those who are follower of sattavik order will most defin=\r\nitely face\n&gt; disaster if they try to adopt tamasik ways. Sadhana means aimi=\r\nng \n&gt; either\n&gt; positive energies or negative energies. Such an endeavor wil=\r\nl cause\n&gt; movement in the energies governing the native. However when someo=\r\nne\n&gt; foolishly mixes both positive and negative energies disaster will be\n&gt;=\r\n resulted because of that one may suddenly loose their father, mother,\n&gt; ch=\r\nildren, face accidents, face state punishment etc. Things will \n&gt; happen\n&gt; =\r\nso suddenly, like a spark or a blast.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; BTW, those who want to understan=\r\nd the gunas composing deities, humans\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; and demons should read Yoga Vaas=\r\nishtham. Vasishtha defines a 3x3\n&gt; matrix\n&gt;&gt; of gunas and places various ki=\r\nnds of deities, humans and demons in\n&gt; that.\n&gt;&gt; His description removes a l=\r\not of misconceptions on &quot;tamasik deities&quot;\n&gt;&gt; etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; So you did read yoga =\r\nVassishtham; still you can&#39;t understand anything\n&gt; about the divinity. With=\r\n you hairy knowledge your downfall is evident.\n&gt; That is all I can say.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; Sattvik way of pleasing lord shiva is offering sattvik things to\n&gt; shiva=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; lingam.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Is Shiva a sattwik deity or a taamasik deity according t=\r\no you? If he\n&gt; is\n&gt;&gt; a taamasik deity, I thought your theory was that he sh=\r\nould not be\n&gt;&gt; worshipped in a saattwik manner! If he is a saattwik deity, =\r\nwhat was\n&gt;&gt; your problem with a saattwik homam to him? You lectured on the\n=\r\n&gt; taamasik\n&gt;&gt; methods above!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I see no consistency in your views and a=\r\nll I can see is stubbornness\n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; terrible misconceptions.\n&gt;\n&gt; That is =\r\nwhy I said that you have no right to compose a solka in honor \n&gt; of\n&gt; lord =\r\nShiva because you don&#39;t know anything about the esoteric plays of\n&gt; divinit=\r\ny. I will not explain to you on this open forum that why it is\n&gt; very very =\r\nauspicious to please as tamasik male deity such as lord \n&gt; shiva\n&gt; in form =\r\nof lingam. You will again say that I should keep my views to\n&gt; myself. Thes=\r\ne things requires little amount of faith.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; He is foolishly creating =\r\na new bread of homa where sattavic way are\n&gt;&gt;&gt; employed\n&gt;&gt;&gt; to perform homa=\r\n of a tamasik deity. What he is teaching is not homa\n&gt;&gt;&gt; but a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; complete=\r\n disaster.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On saattwik, raajasik and taamasik worships, see what Kris=\r\nhna says in\n&gt;&gt; Bhagavad Gita. Just because you consider Rudra to be tamasik=\r\n, worship\n&gt; of\n&gt;&gt; Rudra for spiritual progress does not become taamasik. Ju=\r\nst because \n&gt;&gt; we\n&gt;&gt; consider Vishnu to be saattwik, worship of Vishnu for =\r\nthe death of an\n&gt;&gt; enemy does not become saattwik.\n&gt; Worship of Rudra or sh=\r\niva in form of Shiva Lingam is not tamasik way \n&gt; of\n&gt; worship.\n&gt;\n&gt; Lord Vi=\r\nshnu is rajasik deity, he always sustains. Worship of Vishnu \n&gt; for\n&gt; death=\r\n of an enemy is absolute nonsense.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sattavik ways of worship result in s=\r\ntrengthening the native it can \n&gt; never\n&gt; be used to harm anybody.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tama=\r\nsik ways of worship will results in weakening once enemies, so if\n&gt; one wan=\r\nts to harm once enemies he has to please a tamasik deity.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nature of=\r\n worship is decided based on\n&gt;&gt; the desires, attitude and state of mind. Se=\r\ne what Krishna teaches.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Exactly what you want to say? Are you saying =\r\nthat even if you are\n&gt; praying to evilest arch demon of worst helical reaso=\r\nn even then you \n&gt; are\n&gt; pure if your attitude and state of mind is correct=\r\n? What could be that\n&gt; state of mind? What could be that attitude? I wonder=\r\n=E2=80=A6\n&gt;\n&gt;   As well said by Mr.Kaul; aim of any sadhana is to become on=\r\ne with \n&gt; the\n&gt; deity. So, what state of mind and with which attitude one s=\r\nhould pray \n&gt; to\n&gt; an arch demon so that he didn&#39;t become equal to him?\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; We do not cater to those who want to do homam for taamasik purposes,\n&gt; =\r\nno\n&gt;&gt; matter which deity. We cater to people worshipping various deities \n&gt;=\r\n&gt; for\n&gt;&gt; mostly saattwik purposes, viz fulfilling dharmik desires at the\n&gt; =\r\nmaterial\n&gt;&gt; level and progressing spiritually. So the procedure we teach IS=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; invariable saattwik.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; If you really wants to promote homa then d=\r\no it for sattavik deities \n&gt; only\n&gt; and must emphasis that native of sattav=\r\nik temperament are only advised\n&gt; to do it and only if pure cow ghee is ava=\r\nilable. If homa is done \n&gt; without\n&gt; considering these things then it will =\r\nharm gods. Aim of a sattvik homa\n&gt; is to increase sattva guna in the enviro=\r\nnment. A tamo guni native will\n&gt; cause more harm then doing any good.\n&gt;\n&gt; C=\r\nonsider it as a request.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; It is said in all scriptures that all spirit=\r\nual practices should be\n&gt;&gt;&gt; followed\n&gt;&gt;&gt; under the guidance of a bonafide g=\r\nuru. A native without a capable\n&gt; guru\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; like god without power.\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Those who want a physical guru can think of me or my guru Dr Manish\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n Pandit as gurus for the homam procedures taught by us in free \n&gt;&gt; manuals.=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; If you are doing something wrong because of my instruction, I am\n&gt; will=\r\ning\n&gt;&gt; to take on the karma and suffer the consequences.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; You are do=\r\ning a big mistake here. Be ready to face the consequences.\n&gt; It&#39;s your life=\r\n, what can I say? Best of luck.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The original purohit and the origina=\r\nl guru of Veda is Agni, the Fire.\n&gt; If\n&gt;&gt; you do not have a capable guru, t=\r\nake Agni as the guru, worship him\n&gt;&gt; everyday or every weekend and surrende=\r\nr to him. He will do the job of\n&gt; a\n&gt;&gt; guru and transform you. Anybody who =\r\nsays that is not possible does \n&gt;&gt; not\n&gt;&gt; know the power of Agni! Fire ritu=\r\nal is not my creation. It was the\n&gt;&gt; favorite sadhana of rishis and many cu=\r\nltures benefited from it.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; At the time of rashis, most people are of s=\r\nattavik nature and pure cow\n&gt; ghee, pure grains and pure wood are readily a=\r\nvailable.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Those who do not like homam, please do not do it. But plea=\r\nse do not\n&gt;&gt; discourage others who may be interested. That is a bad karma.\n=\r\n&gt; Especially\n&gt;&gt; in today&#39;s times.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Asking you to do homa of sattavik=\r\n deity with pure cow ghee and pure\n&gt; other offerings is not a bad karma. Th=\r\nis karma will definitely bring\n&gt; good fortunes to me.

As a m=\r\natter\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of fact all sadhanas are aimed towards strengthening the basic la=\r\nws\n&gt; of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nature. If a native with his deeds be able to strengthen these =\r\nlaw\n&gt; he\n&gt;&gt;&gt; will be benefited and will rise in life.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; There are pri=\r\nmary two way of doing any sadhana, one is sattavic and\n&gt;&gt;&gt; other is tamasik=\r\n also known as right handed and left handed paths.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Vedic philosophy is =\r\nright handed and tantaric philosophy is left\n&gt;&gt;&gt; handed.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Correct pr=\r\nocedure of performing a sattavic homa is that native\n&gt;&gt;&gt; collects dry mango=\r\n tree wood since mango karaka is surya and thus is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; considered as most s=\r\nattvic tree. Then native must arrange absolutely\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pure cow ghee. It is w=\r\nell known who sattavic cow ghee is; its many\n&gt;&gt;&gt; times pure then normal buf=\r\nfalo ghee. Then one collects other\n&gt; offering\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of absolutely sattavic in=\r\n nature. It is also essential that sadhak\n&gt;&gt;&gt; must be of sattavic temperame=\r\nnt and not accustomed to vices such as\n&gt;&gt;&gt; lying, cheating, consuming alcoh=\r\nol etc. If native is a brahmachari\n&gt;&gt;&gt; then it is very favorable. Now nativ=\r\ne must choose mantras of\n&gt; sattavic\n&gt;&gt;&gt; gods such as soma, agni, prajapati,=\r\n indra, savitura etc. This homa\n&gt;&gt;&gt; must be is performed early in the morni=\r\nng since during this time\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sattva guna is maximum. Native should face ea=\r\nst direction from where\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sun rises as sun is the harbinger of sattva gun=\r\na. In the similar\n&gt;&gt;&gt; fashion many more rule exists which when followed cor=\r\nrectly will\n&gt;&gt;&gt; result in a homa which will leave its everlasting impressio=\r\nn on the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; native and will bring tremendous auspicious results.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; C=\r\norrect procedure of performing a tamasik homa is that native\n&gt; collect\n&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nwood of some tamasik tree such as babool, kikar then tantarick must\n&gt;&gt;&gt; arr=\r\nange all tamasik offering such a mensulation blood, flesh, fish,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; alchoa=\r\nl, some kind of tamasik oil etc. It is also essential that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sadhak must =\r\nbe of tamasik temperament must consume alcohol, meat\n&gt;&gt;&gt; himself. He must h=\r\nave very active sex life. Now such a native must\n&gt;&gt;&gt; choose mantras of tama=\r\nsik deity and perform this homa in the middle\n&gt; of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; night when tamo guna=\r\n is maximum and he must face south direction.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; These are some of ver=\r\ny general rules of correctly performing both\n&gt; left\n&gt;&gt;&gt; handed and right ha=\r\nnded homas. As a matter of fact, some rules are\n&gt; so\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cryptic and esoter=\r\nic that native will only understand these as the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; merit of many lifetime=\r\ns. These rules are kept as secret of utmost\n&gt;&gt;&gt; importance and only discipl=\r\nes of those traditions can come any\n&gt; closer\n&gt;&gt;&gt; to these rules. Kashmari t=\r\nantrism is highly developed tradition and\n&gt; as\n&gt;&gt;&gt; you belong to this cult,=\r\n you must be well aware about these\n&gt; delicacies\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of your tradition.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Narashima is very quick to give reference of shiva homa in tantrik\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n literature and tamasik purans; better if he can read these\n&gt; literatures\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; more deeply and try to understand correct procedure to performing\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ta=\r\nmasik homa.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; He is foolishly creating a new bread of homa where satt=\r\navic way are\n&gt;&gt;&gt; employed to perform homa of a tamasik deity. What he is te=\r\naching is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; not homa but a complete disaster. Either he is deliberately m=\r\nixing\n&gt;&gt;&gt; both left and right handed paths or he is intellectually week to\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; differentiate between the two. Whatever is the reason, but he must\n&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nstop doing this catastrophe. Based on his faith and believes he\n&gt; should\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; either choose left or right handed path. He has no right to mix both\n&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nof them and thus creating a recipe of disaster. Think about those\n&gt; poor\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; soles that have been mentally, emotionally and spiritually harmed by\n&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nperforming this stupidity.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Sattvik way of pleasing lord shiva is of=\r\nfering sattvik things to\n&gt; shiva\n&gt;&gt;&gt; lingam. This is most appropriate and b=\r\neneficial way to receive\n&gt;&gt;&gt; blessings of lord shiva. For the same purpose =\r\nmillions of temples\n&gt; have\n&gt;&gt;&gt; been erected all over India.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Best re=\r\ngards,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Arun\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com, AK Kaul &lt;j=\r\nyotirved@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shri Arun Yadav ji,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jai Shri Ram!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You=\r\n appear to be eating a long yarn about a simple point that &quot;Lord\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shiva=\r\n is\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; never ever pleased with homa of any kind or any type.

Are you saying that even if yo=\r\nu are&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; praying to evilest arch demon of worst helical reason&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nRudra, Chandi, Shiva etc are NOT &quot;arch demons&quot;!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWe started this=\r\n conversation because you &quot;condemned&quot; homam to Shiva as &lt;br&gt;\nit is not give=\r\nn in any scripture according to you. When shown ample &lt;br&gt;\nreferences, you =\r\nbemoaned that taamasik deities should not be worshipped &lt;br&gt;\nwith saattwik =\r\nmethods and said homam to taamasik deities should include &lt;br&gt;\n&quot;menstruatio=\r\nn blood, meat, fish, alcohol&quot; etc. Now you are making them &lt;br&gt;\nout to be d=\r\nemons. See my note in the other mail on gunas.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; If you really =\r\nwants to promote homa then do it for sattavik deities &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; only&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nIf YOU have faith in saattwik deities, you worship saattwik deities. We =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nWILL enable people to worship various deities (including Shiva!) in &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nfire, in a saattwik manner.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Most straight forward way to w=\r\norship a tamasik deity is through vaama&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; maarga; this is the hard t=\r\nruth which is very difficult for you to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; digest. Those who consume =\r\nalcohol, fish  have already been initiated &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; on&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to vaama m=\r\narga. They have no other option left with them other then&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; worshipi=\r\nng a tamasik deity.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nVaama maarga is not just consuming alcohol and=\r\n fish. Your understanding &lt;br&gt;\nof vaama maarga is pitiable. It is not that =\r\nyou just have fun and a &lt;br&gt;\ndeluded demonic deity who also likes fun comes=\r\n along and helps you.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWe say &quot;all is Brahman&quot; and yet we treat som=\r\ne things as pure and some as &lt;br&gt;\nimpure. Vaama maarga is about taking some=\r\nthing considered impure and &lt;br&gt;\nbeing able to actually view it as Brahman =\r\nand not as a limited thing &lt;br&gt;\nthat evokes attraction or aversion in mind.=\r\n It is about removing &lt;br&gt;\nattraction and aversion for various things from =\r\nthe mind completely and &lt;br&gt;\nliberating one. Vaama maarga is not for all an=\r\nd certainly not for those &lt;br&gt;\nwho want to enjoy alcohol, fish etc.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nBest regards,&lt;br&gt;\nNarasimha&lt;br&gt;\n-----------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------&lt;br&gt;\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyoti=\r\nsh Writings,&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri =\r\nTarpana:&lt;br&gt;\n                   &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n      Films that make a difference: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; h=\r\nref=3D&quot;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      S=\r\npirituality: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.ya=\r\nhoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n   Jyotish writings: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http=\r\n://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jy=\r\notishWritings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108&lt;br&gt;\n-----=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a re=\r\nl=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:JyotishGroup%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;=\r\n_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:JyotishGroup%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;JyotishGroup@yahoogr=\r\noups.com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Arun Yadav&quot; &lt;aruninthecity@...&gt; &lt;br&gt;\nwrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  =\r\n Jai Shree Ram,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Shree Narasimha Ji,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Kin=\r\ndly read my response in blue font face.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Narashima=\r\n is very quick to give reference of shiva homa in tantrik&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nliterature&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and tamasik purans&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Fi=\r\nrst of all, I quoted Vishnu Dharmottara Purana and Agni Purana! If&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; Agni (Fire!) Purana is not an acceptable reference for homam, I &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt;&gt; wonder&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; what is!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Is it fault of agni =\r\ndeva that someone write a tamasik Purana after his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; name?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Second of all, the notion that some puranas are saattwik, some=\r\n are&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; rajasik and some are tamasik, was conjured by people who =\r\ncould not&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; reconcile apparent contradictions within different p=\r\nuranas. If one&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; understands the Upanishadic essence correctly, =\r\nall contradictions &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; fall&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; in place and all puranas=\r\n are meaningful.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Yes, yes keep on mixing what ever come t=\r\no you. I wonder that if you &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; were&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; present when devas and =\r\ndemons perform samundra manthan then you would&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; have even mixed pot=\r\ns of amrita and visha to from your new recipe of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; disaster.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; Initially at the time of creation lord divided potency into two entity&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; which are solar and lunar also called Law of Two. Then he further&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; divided it into three entities known as sattva, rajas and tamas also=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; known as law of Three. Then he further divided into four entities=\r\n and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; so&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; on. The fact that everything has emerged from on=\r\ne entity known as &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Brahma&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; is Law of One. Those who are in=\r\ntellectually capable to understand &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; this;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; for them their =\r\nis no contradiction.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Upanishadic essence which you talked=\r\n about but have never understand; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; i&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; have served it in yo=\r\nur karma platter. Now be wise enough to digest it.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt=\r\n; There are primary two way of doing any sadhana, one is sattavic and&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt;&gt;&gt; other is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tamasik also known as right handed an=\r\nd left handed paths. Vedic&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; philosophy is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nright handed and tantaric philosophy is left handed.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&=\r\ngt; All tantrik philosophy is NOT left handed. There are right handed&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt;&gt; tantras as well as left handed tantras. You are totally off the mar=\r\nk.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; In your figment of imagination you have created your o=\r\nwn world which &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; based on your faulty knowledge which y=\r\nou have gained from goggling. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Come&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; out of it and face th=\r\ne hard truths.

You should read scriptures of your&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; faith and try to unde=\r\nrstand it yourself and kindly spare me with the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; horror of suggesti=\r\nng anything to you.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The above is utter nonsense.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; It is saying that the only way to worship some fierce deities (let=\r\n me&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; use this term instead of tamasik deities) is through vaama=\r\n maarga&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (left-handed path). That is nonsense. Left-handed path=\r\n is for those&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; who&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; are already so pure that even meat,=\r\n fish, alcohol and sex do not&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; distract one&#39;s focus from god an=\r\nd from the deep realization that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot;sarvam&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; khalvidam br=\r\nahma&quot;. It is not for all. As Robert Svoboda correctly &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; says&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; at the beginning of &quot;Aghora: At the left hand of god&quot;, most peop=\r\nle &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; who&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; are attracted to this path for the kick a=\r\nre doomed to fail and those&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; who&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; are pure enough for i=\r\nt are not attracted to it.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Fierce deities such as=\r\n Rudra, Durga, Chandi etc can be worshipped in &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n saattwik manner also and THAT is better for MOST people.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Most straight forward way to worship a tamasik deity is through vaama&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; maarga; this is the hard truth which is very difficult for you to&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; digest. Those who consume alcohol, fish  have already been initiated &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; on&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to vaama marga. They have no other option left with th=\r\nem other then&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; worshiping a tamasik deity. Those people who consume=\r\n alcohol and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; recite&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; mantras of sattavik deities; disaste=\r\nr will fall upon then and they &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; will&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; soon loose all of th=\r\neir land, wealth and prestige. This is called&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; spiritual and moral =\r\ndecay of the society. Same is the cause of the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; decay&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of =\r\nIndia and firstly mugals and then Britishers rules over us. Same &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nkind&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of spiritual decay can be seen with Kashmire pundits and they=\r\n also &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; loose&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; all of their lands and homes and become refu=\r\ngees.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Spiritual and moral decay of any society is the rea=\r\nson of its fall.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Those who can&#39;t stand firm on their dharma will f=\r\nall. These are not my&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; own views, read literature related to Aachya=\r\nra Chanakya.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Those who are follower of sattavik order wil=\r\nl most definitely face&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; disaster if they try to adopt tamasik ways.=\r\n Sadhana means aiming &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; either&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; positive energies or negati=\r\nve energies. Such an endeavor will cause&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; movement in the energies =\r\ngoverning the native. However when someone&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; foolishly mixes both po=\r\nsitive and negative energies disaster will be&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; resulted because of =\r\nthat one may suddenly loose their father, mother,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; children, face a=\r\nccidents, face state punishment etc. Things will &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; happen&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nso suddenly, like a spark or a blast.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; BTW, those who =\r\nwant to understand the gunas composing deities, humans&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt=\r\n; and demons should read Yoga Vaasishtham. Vasishtha defines a 3x3&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n matrix&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; of gunas and places various kinds of deities, humans a=\r\nnd demons in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; that.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; His description removes a lot of m=\r\nisconceptions on &quot;tamasik deities&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; etc.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; So y=\r\nou did read yoga Vassishtham; still you can&#39;t understand anything&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nabout the divinity. With you hairy knowledge your downfall is evident.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; That is all I can say.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Sattvik way of pleasi=\r\nng lord shiva is offering sattvik things to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; shiva&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n lingam.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Is Shiva a sattwik deity or a taamasik d=\r\neity according to you? If he&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; a taamasik deity, I t=\r\nhought your theory was that he should not be&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; worshipped in a s=\r\naattwik manner! If he is a saattwik deity, what was&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; your probl=\r\nem with a saattwik homam to him? You lectured on the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; taamasik&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; methods above!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I see no consistency in y=\r\nour views and all I can see is stubbornness&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; terri=\r\nble misconceptions.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; That is why I said that you have no r=\r\night to compose a solka in honor &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; lord Shiva because y=\r\nou don&#39;t know anything about the esoteric plays of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; divinity. I wil=\r\nl not explain to you on this open forum that why it is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; very very a=\r\nuspicious to please as tamasik male deity such as lord &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; shiva&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; in form of lingam. You will again say that I should keep my views to&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; myself. These things requires little amount of faith.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; He is foolishly creating a new bread of homa where sa=\r\nttavic way are&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; employed&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; to perform homa o=\r\nf a tamasik deity. What he is teaching is not homa&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; but a&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; complete disaster.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On saattwik, r=\r\naajasik and taamasik worships, see what Krishna says in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Bhagav=\r\nad Gita. Just because you consider Rudra to be tamasik, worship&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Rudra for spiritual progress does not become taamasik. Just b=\r\necause &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; we&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; consider Vishnu to be saattwik, worshi=\r\np of Vishnu for the death of an&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; enemy does not become saattwik=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Worship of Rudra or shiva in form of Shiva Lingam is not tamasik=\r\n way &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; worship.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Lord Vishnu is rajasi=\r\nk deity, he always sustains. Worship of Vishnu &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; for&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; death=\r\n of an enemy is absolute nonsense.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Sattavik ways of worsh=\r\nip result in strengthening the native it can &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; never&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; be us=\r\ned to harm anybody.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Tamasik ways of worship will results =\r\nin weakening once enemies, so if&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; one wants to harm once enemies he=\r\n has to please a tamasik deity.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Nature =\r\nof worship is decided based on&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; the desires, attitude and state=\r\n of mind. See what Krishna teaches.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Exactly what=\r\n you want to say? Are you saying that even if you are&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; praying to e=\r\nvilest arch demon of worst helical reason even then you &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; are&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; pure if your attitude and state of mind is correct? What could be that&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; state of mind? What could be that attitude? I wonder=E2=80=A6&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;   As well said by Mr.Kaul; aim of any sadhana is to become on=\r\ne with &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; deity. So, what state of mind and with which =\r\nattitude one should pray &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; an arch demon so that he did=\r\nn&#39;t become equal to him?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; We do not cater to =\r\nthose who want to do homam for taamasik purposes,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; no&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nmatter which deity. We cater to people worshipping various deities &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n;&gt; for&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; mostly saattwik purposes, viz fulfilling dharmik des=\r\nires at the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; material&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; level and progressing spirituall=\r\ny. So the procedure we teach IS&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; invariable saattwik.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; If you really wants to promote homa then do it f=\r\nor sattavik deities &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; only&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and must emphasis that native o=\r\nf sattavik temperament are only advised&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to do it and only if pure =\r\ncow ghee is available. If homa is done &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; without&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; consideri=\r\nng these things then it will harm gods. Aim of a sattvik homa&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; is t=\r\no increase sattva guna in the environment. A tamo guni native will&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n cause more harm then doing any good.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Consider it as a re=\r\nquest.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; It is said in all scriptures that all spir=\r\nitual practices should be&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; followed&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; under =\r\nthe guidance of a bonafide guru. A native without a capable&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; guru&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; like god without power.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Those who want a physical guru can think of me or my guru Dr Man=\r\nish&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Pandit as gurus for the homam procedures taught by us in f=\r\nree &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; manuals.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you are doing something wrong be=\r\ncause of my instruction, I am&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; willing&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; to take on the =\r\nkarma and suffer the consequences.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; You =\r\nare doing a big mistake here. Be ready to face the consequences.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I=\r\nt&#39;s your life, what can I say? Best of luck.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n The original purohit and the original guru of Veda is Agni, the Fire.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; If&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; you do not have a capable guru, take Agni as the guru,=\r\n worship him&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; everyday or every weekend and surrender to him. H=\r\ne will do the job of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; guru and transform you. Anybod=\r\ny who says that is not possible does &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; not&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; know th=\r\ne power of Agni! Fire ritual is not my creation. It was the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; fa=\r\nvorite sadhana of rishis and many cultures benefited from it.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; At the time of rashis, most people are of sattavik nature and=\r\n pure cow&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ghee, pure grains and pure wood are readily available.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Those who do not like homam, please do not do=\r\n it. But please do not&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; discourage others who may be interested=\r\n. That is a bad karma.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Especially&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; in today&#39;s times.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Asking you to do homa of sattavik deity =\r\nwith pure cow ghee and pure&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; other offerings is not a bad karma. Th=\r\nis karma will definitely bring&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; good fortunes to me. Definitely.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Arun.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ym=\r\nailto=3D&quot;mailto:JyotishGroup%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;m=\r\nailto:JyotishGroup%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Ar=\r\nun Yadav&quot; aruninthecity@&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt; Jai Shree Ram,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Shree A K Kaul Ji,&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#39;s nice that you participate but try to un=\r\nderstand the context&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; only&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; then you can bring some=\r\nthing productive to the discussion.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; There=\r\n is a way to perform spiritual sadhana which bring prosperity&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; happiness to the individual and to the people concerned. A=\r\ns a matter&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of fact all sadhanas are aimed towards strength=\r\nening the basic laws&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nature. If a native with =\r\nhis deeds be able to strengthen these law&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; he&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; will=\r\n be benefited and will rise in life.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Ther=\r\ne are primary two way of doing any sadhana, one is sattavic and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt=\r\n;&gt; other is tamasik also known as right handed and left handed paths.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Vedic philosophy is right handed and tantaric philosophy is =\r\nleft&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; handed.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Correct pro=\r\ncedure of performing a sattavic homa is that native&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; collec=\r\nts dry mango tree wood since mango karaka is surya and thus is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; considered as most sattvic tree. Then native must arrange absolutely&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pure cow ghee. It is well known who sattavic cow ghee is; i=\r\nts many&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; times pure then normal buffalo ghee. Then one coll=\r\nects other&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; offering&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of absolutely sattavic in nat=\r\nure. It is also essential that sadhak&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; must be of sattavic =\r\ntemperament and not accustomed to vices such as&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; lying, che=\r\nating, consuming alcohol etc. If native is a brahmachari&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; t=\r\nhen it is very favorable. Now native must choose mantras of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; sattav=\r\nic&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; gods such as soma, agni, prajapati, indra, savitura etc=\r\n. This homa&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; must be is performed early in the morning sinc=\r\ne during this time&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sattva guna is maximum. Native should f=\r\nace east direction from where&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sun rises as sun is the harb=\r\ninger of sattva guna. In the similar&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; fashion many more rul=\r\ne exists which when followed correctly will&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; result in a ho=\r\nma which will leave its everlasting impression on the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nati=\r\nve and will bring tremendous auspicious results.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&=\r\ngt;&gt; Correct procedure of performing a tamasik homa is that native&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; collect&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; wood of some tamasik tree such as babool, kika=\r\nr then tantarick must&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; arrange all tamasik offering such a =\r\nmensulation blood, flesh, fish,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; alchoal, some kind of tama=\r\nsik oil etc. It is also essential that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sadhak must be of t=\r\namasik temperament must consume alcohol, meat&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; himself. He =\r\nmust have very active sex life. Now such a native must&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cho=\r\nose mantras of tamasik deity and perform this homa in the middle&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; o=\r\nf&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; night when tamo guna is maximum and he must face south d=\r\nirection.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; These are some of very general =\r\nrules of correctly performing both&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; left&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; handed an=\r\nd right handed homas. As a matter of fact, some rules are&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; so&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt;&gt;&gt; cryptic and esoteric that native will only understand these as =\r\nthe&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; merit of many lifetimes. These rules are kept as secre=\r\nt of utmost&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; importance and only disciples of those traditi=\r\nons can come any&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; closer&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; to these rules. Kashmari =\r\ntantrism is highly developed tradition and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; as&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; you=\r\n belong to this cult, you must be well aware about these&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; delicacie=\r\ns&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of your tradition.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Nar=\r\nashima is very quick to give reference of shiva homa in tantrik&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt=\r\n;&gt; literature and tamasik purans; better if he can read these&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; l=\r\niteratures&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; more deeply and try to understand correct proce=\r\ndure to performing&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tamasik homa.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; He is foolishly creating a new bread of homa where sattavic way ar=\r\ne&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; employed to perform homa of a tamasik deity. What he is =\r\nteaching is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; not homa but a complete disaster. Either he is=\r\n deliberately mixing&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; both left and right handed paths or h=\r\ne is intellectually week to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; differentiate between the two.=\r\n Whatever is the reason, but he must&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; stop doing this catas=\r\ntrophe. Based on his faith and believes he&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; should&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n either choose left or right handed path. He has no right to mix both&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt;&gt;&gt; of them and thus creating a recipe of disaster.
