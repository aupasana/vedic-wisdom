But do not think in terms of deity X and deity Y not liking e=\r\nach \n&gt; other and doing their mantras together making them angry with you, e=\r\ntc. \n&gt; Deities are far more subtle than us.\n&gt; \n&gt; If my son asks me how to s=\r\ntudy math, I may tell him to study for half \n&gt; hour, take some rest, have a=\r\n snack, and study again. If he asks my wife \n&gt; the same thing, she may tell=\r\n him sternly to study for 4 hours, before \n&gt; breaking. He better ask one of=\r\n us and stick to what that person says. If \n&gt; he asks both and we give diff=\r\nerent directions, he will be confused. It \n&gt; is not that I and my wife disl=\r\nike each other for giving a different \n&gt; advice. I know her and I am not su=\r\nrprised by her advice. Similarly, she \n&gt; knows me and she is not surprised =\r\nby my advice. But it is better for my \n&gt; son to follow one approach.\n&gt; \n&gt; S=\r\nimilarly, approach of savitA and kALI may be different.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, it =\r\nis not just deity&#39;s name or mantra. It is in your attitude \n&gt; and how you v=\r\nisualize/imagine the deity (consciously or even \n&gt; sub-consciously). I, for=\r\n example, do a Chandi homam every morning. After \n&gt; the homam, as the poorn=\r\naahuti burns, I meditate for half hour with \n&gt; savitR^i gAyatrI mantra. I d=\r\no not feel weird about mixing chanDIpAtha \n&gt; (durgA saptashati) and gAyatrI=\r\n mantra. Even as I invoke Chandi in fire \n&gt; and read durgAsaptashati, I vis=\r\nualize Aadyaa Mahalakshmi, the shakti of \n&gt; the supreme cosmic being, who d=\r\nivided herself into Mahalakshmi, Mahakali \n&gt; and Mahasaraswati. The dhyana =\r\nshloka I use for invocation is \n&gt; &quot;sarvasyAdyA mahAlakShmI triguNA paramesh=\r\nvarI lakShyAlakShyasvarUpA yA \n&gt; vyApya kR^itsnaM vyavasthitA...&quot; So my vis=\r\nualization of the devata is \n&gt; highly saattwik and close to that of savitA =\r\nand sAvitrI!\n&gt; \n&gt; Someone else may be visualizing Chandi as someone fierce =\r\nand angry and \n&gt; cutting off heads with umpteen weapons etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Each deva=\r\ntA and mantra has a range of possibilities. Depending on how \n&gt; you visuali=\r\nze a devatA and mantra and with what attitude, it works on \n&gt; you according=\r\nly, within that range of possibilities. It is always better \n&gt; to stick to =\r\none mantra for a few months or years. Of course, people who \n&gt; have such de=\r\nnse conditioning that mantras do not really have any \n&gt; immediately visible=\r\n impact on their consciousness, may do as many \n&gt; mantras as they want. If =\r\nyou see that some mantras are having a visible \n&gt; impact on you, it is a go=\r\nod sign. But it is better then to use the \n&gt; feedback and stick to one mant=\r\nra.\n&gt; \n&gt; You may want to experiment with homam with the Kali mantra that is=\r\n \n&gt; helping you deal with your problems better.\n&gt; \n&gt; In Kali yuga, Vishnu s=\r\nahasra naama stotra and Chandipath are two stotras \n&gt; that are said to work=\r\n effectively. Consider experimenting with \n&gt; Chandipath, perhaps one chapte=\r\nr a day.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish=\r\n Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Hom=\r\nam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;=\r\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spir=\r\nituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings:=\r\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;                       Twit=\r\nter ID: @homam108\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, Jul 14, 2011 at 1:13 AM, vedicastrostudent wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; \n&gt;     Dear Narasimhaji and others,\n&gt; \n&gt; I used to meditatively liste=\r\nn to/chant the Savitur Gayatri every \n&gt; morning, and on the weekends, I did=\r\n a homam also (doing the Savitur \n&gt; Gayatri). Gayatri, especially in Homan =\r\nseems to make things awaken in \n&gt; me, even with a tinge of sexual desire, y=\r\net still making me more \n&gt; spiritual. Separately, for the past few months, =\r\nI have been having this \n&gt; heavy weight of a depressive feeling (due to sev=\r\neral events/situations \n&gt; in my life) which just hasnt left me, and even th=\r\ne Gayatri/Homam doesnt \n&gt; relieve except immediately after a Homam for less=\r\n than a day. After some \n&gt; reading around and doing some astrology, I final=\r\nly arrived at a Kali \n&gt; mantra - Om Kreem Kalikaye namah, and I have starte=\r\nd meditating on that \n&gt; every morning, but I still do weekend homams with S=\r\navitur Gayatri. But \n&gt; things have changed now. The Kali mantra is very pun=\r\nishing in a mental \n&gt; tightness kind of way, yet still helps me deal with m=\r\nental hardship \n&gt; without completely giving up/getting angry/stressed. So I=\r\n have continued \n&gt; it. Yet the day I do Savitur Gayatri homam, the Gayatri =\r\nresults seems a \n&gt; bit weaker - I have no idea why. Also, if I dont meditat=\r\ne on the Kali \n&gt; mantra later on in the same day (i.e. if I try to drop a d=\r\nay of doing \n&gt; Kali mantra), I get into conflicts much more easily. Is ther=\r\ne some kind \n&gt; of conflict between the two?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Sundeep\n&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
