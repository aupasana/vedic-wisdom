However in temples I have seen tha=\r\nt whenever there is a Chandi Homam, 10 people sit down to recite the entire=\r\n Durga Saptashati (Chandi Path). Then one person offers the ahuti. This tec=\r\nhnically fulfils the 10:1 requirement. However one thing to remember is tha=\r\nt such activities in temples are not generally done for one&#39;s individual sp=\r\niritual progress. Rather it is sponsored by a person for his lowkika &quot;desir=\r\ned&quot; fruits. Also when done from the temple itself, it is generally done for=\r\n the betterment of the community, society etc. \n&gt; \n&gt; My 2 cents.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regar=\r\nds,\n&gt; Ashutosh\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;ve=\r\ndic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Ashutosh,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Very interesting inf=\r\normation mainly because it came via Ashtamangal Prashna.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Til to be=\r\n mixed atleast with some Ghee and not to be offered Dry and for that matter=\r\n any material - This is a kind of Indication to me as well. during my today=\r\n&#39;s ashtami Full fledged Chandi Havan, I did stopped for a momoent to think =\r\nmixing of White Til with ghee. I did not do it eventually though but your p=\r\nost is a kind of confirmation signal for me atleast. Narasimha Garu normall=\r\ny indicates that whatever one offer in Ahuti should not be completely dry. =\r\nonce he suggested me that if i offer Cowdung cakes as Ahuti, then i dhould =\r\ndip that in ghee and offer. so this thing is very clear.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2ndly, I =\r\nwish to understand about &quot;Chandi Path verses&quot; which are recited while offer=\r\ning Ahuti iN Chandi Homas.

Hmm... let me see... Hmm.. Yes=\r\n... You seem to be performing some kind of Agni karya at your home regularl=\r\ny.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Myself: Yes (I was actually very surprised by this pointed =\r\nquestion because I had not told anybody about the havan I did at home)\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: There are certain errors in the agni karya you =\r\nare doing. You seem to be using dry samith materials. And your ahuti does n=\r\not seem to be right.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Myself: Yes I am using Til (sesame seeds)=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: You should mix that with atleast a little=\r\n bit of ghee before giving it as ahuti.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Myself: Ok. And what i=\r\ns the dosha in my ahuti apart from that?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: Do=\r\n you do required Japa before giving ahutis? And do you do the ahuti with th=\r\ne same mantra that you use for your regular japa?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Myself: What=\r\n?... Required Japa? Is there a pre-requisite like that? No I dont do any pr=\r\ne-defined set of japa?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: Yes. Strictly the ja=\r\npa-ahuti ratio is shatamsha. (that is for every 100 recitation of a mantra =\r\nvia meditation, one becomes qualified for one ahuti) or at least it should =\r\nbe dashamsha ( i.e. for every 10 recitations of mantra in meditation, one i=\r\ns qualified to give 1 ahuti)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Myself: Doesnt that only apply to=\r\n purascharaNa (based on what I read in Aghore book - as everybody in this g=\r\nroup is already familiar with that book series)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; PrashNa conduc=\r\ntor: No it applies to anything. PurascharaNa or regular chanting. Doesnt ma=\r\ntter. The rule is always 1:100 or at least 1:10. You have to follow it stri=\r\nctly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The conversation went onto several other things. Subsequ=\r\nently I went on to get mantra-upadesha from a accomplished seer and recitin=\r\ng that mantra and also using the same mantra for my ahuti in homam as per t=\r\nhe above mentioned ratio only and have been very happy with my spiritual pr=\r\nogress since. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Whether all the homa-practioners in this group =\r\nagree with me or not, I just wanted to point this out to all requesting eve=\r\nrybody to perform at least 10 times Japa of the mantra used for ahuti to ge=\r\nt the &quot;qualification&quot; for the ahuti.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ashutosh\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
