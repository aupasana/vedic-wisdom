S. Anantha Murthy visited Sri Ramanasramam for ten days. He\nga=\r\nve a detailed account of this visit in his book the Life and Teachings of\nS=\r\nree Ramana Maharshi. With this issue we conclude his story related in\nchapt=\r\ner sixteen, titled &quot;Sree Ramana Bestows His Grace on the Present\nBiographer=\r\n in 1937.&quot;\n\nThere were more guests than on the previous night. Some were wo=\r\nmen. Among\nmen, some were Christians. One Mussalman guest was also sitting =\r\nalong with\nus. Some were foreigners. All castes of Hindus were represented =\r\nin that\ndining room. Sri Ramana&#39;s habits were cosmopolitan.Cooks and server=\r\ns were,\nhowever, all brahmins.Among cooks, there was a woman cook also. All=\r\n were old\ndevotees of the sage and they had volunteered to serve in the ash=\r\nram by way\nof spiritual sadhana. Sri Ramana was seated on the raised platfo=\r\nrm and a\nleaf was spread in front of him.\n\nDuring morning hours, there was =\r\nno restriction of women&#39;s movements in the\nashram. When all the guests were=\r\n seated, the servers began to serve the\nmidday meal. Echammal, a woman devo=\r\ntee of the sage, had brought cooked rice\nfrom her house in a vessel. She se=\r\nrved a handful of it on Sri Ramana&#39;s leaf.\nShe then served small quantities=\r\n of it to the other guests of the day. She\nhad been permitted to perform th=\r\nis kind of service, and I learnt that she\nhad been doing so for many years.=\r\n Her ancient story was ascertained by\nquestioning some of the attendants of=\r\n the ashram. She was old in years. She\nwas dignified and quiet and did not =\r\nspeak with anyone. After rendering this\nkind of service, she went back to t=\r\nhe town to take her own meal.\n\nThough there was complete informality in the=\r\n dining room, every guest ate\nfood respectfully, looking at Sri Ramana at f=\r\nrequent intervals. Some of the\nguests were orthodox brahmins. They did not =\r\nlike to mingle with the\nnon-brahmin guests. So they were made to sit in an =\r\nadjacent room and the\nsame articles of food were served to them by the same=\r\n servers. The midday\nmeal too was simple. It consisted of rice, pickles, ve=\r\ngetable curry,\nchutney, sambar, and buttermilk. The meal was finished in fi=\r\nfteen minutes.\nSri Ramana stood up after he had finished the meal and walke=\r\nd out into the\ncourtyard and washed his hands and feet and then went into t=\r\nhe hall and\nreclined on the sofa for rest. His attendants closed the doors =\r\nand asked\nvisitors not to cause any disturbance.\n\nAt about 9.00 a.m. on the=\r\n next morning, I was sitting in the hall of the\nashram a few yards in front=\r\n of Sri Ramana, who was seated in samadhi state\non the sofa. Many men and w=\r\nomen devotees were also sitting on the floor with\ntheir eyes closed. Perfec=\r\nt silence prevailed. We were all watching the sage,\nwho was effortlessly si=\r\ntting absorbed in the Self. To watch him was itself a\ngreat inspiration. An=\r\n old brahmin pundit, who was till then sitting with his\neyes shut, stood up=\r\n and walked one or two steps forward and stood near Sri\nRamana&#39;s sofa. This=\r\n pundit was clad in silk upper anga-vastram and a dhoti\nbeneath his waist. =\r\nHe wore two diamond rings on two of his fingers of the\nleft hand. He had di=\r\namond-set earrings also. His tall forehead was marked by\nvibhuti stripes. T=\r\nhere was also a big kumkum mark between his two eyebrows.\nHe was a well bui=\r\nlt old man. He loudly addressed Sri Ramana in Telugu and\nspoke with a stent=\r\norian voice. He said, &quot;Swamiji, many men and women are now\nsitting before y=\r\nou in order to get some instruction. You do not speak even\none word. They t=\r\noo do not put any questions to you. They are all silently\nsitting to learn =\r\nsomething. What are you teaching them? What are they\nlearning from you? Ple=\r\nase explain this secret to me.&quot;\n\nSri Ramana did not stir. He did not open h=\r\nis eyes or make any gesture to\nindicate that he had heard the loud words ut=\r\ntered by the old pundit. All of\nus were eager to listen to any answer that =\r\nthe great sage might give. The\nquestioner stood for five minutes hoping tha=\r\nt the sage would give a reply.\nHowever, the sage continued to sit with his =\r\neyes closed as before. The old\npundit started to speak again and said in Te=\r\nlugu as follows: &quot;My two\nquestions have not been answered by you, Swamiji. =\r\nI too cannot discover the\nanswers. Please explain the matter by word of mou=\r\nth.&quot; After having thus\nspoken, he continued to stand. Sri Ramana then opene=\r\nd his bright eyes and\nlooked at the old pundit and replied in Telugu as fol=\r\nlows: &quot;What are you\nasking me? Is there any one here to teach others?&quot; Unab=\r\nle to give an answer\nto the questions put by the sage himself, the Telugu p=\r\nundit said again as\nfollows: &quot;If it is so, why are so many men and women si=\r\ntting patiently in\nfront of you? What profit do they derive by sitting in t=\r\nhis hall?&quot;\n\nSri Ramana, with a slight smile on his serene face, gave the fo=\r\nllowing\ninstructive reply. He said in Telugu, &quot;The question must be put the=\r\nre. Why\nare you putting that question here?&quot; When he used the adverb there,=\r\n the sage\nstretched his hand towards the assembled devotees. When he used t=\r\nhe other\nadverb here, he turned his hand towards himself. Such were his sug=\r\ngestive\ngestures and answers. From the words and gestures of Sri Ramana, I =\r\nrealized\na profound secret. Other devotees assembled in the hall must have =\r\nalso\nrealized the same thing. That was this: Sri Ramana had no notion or id=\r\nea\nthat he was a teacher or a Guru. Likewise, he had no notion or idea that=\r\n the\nmen and women sitting in the hall were ignorant and that they needed\ne=\r\nnlightenment. From the great sage&#39;s point of view, every one in the hall\nwa=\r\ns Brahman or Atman. His drishti was that of a knower of Brahman. Knowers\nof=\r\n Brahman have Brahman drishti.\n\nOnce answering to one devotee question Sri =\r\nRamana replied as follows: &quot;Yes,\neverything is Brahman. Every vritti of the=\r\n mind including grief or sorrow is\nBrahman. Every kind of strength, includi=\r\nng physical strength, will be\nobtained by a person when he realizes his Atm=\r\nan.&quot;\n\nThe last day of my sojourn at Ramanasramam arrived. On that morning, =\r\nI took\nmy breakfast sitting in front of Sri Ramana in the same dining room.=\r\n Many\nother guests were also present. Some of them were newcomers. The usua=\r\nl\nbreakfast of iddli and sambar and hot coffee was finished in ten minutes.=\r\n\nSri Ramana sipped the coffee slowly after reducing its temperature. On tha=\r\nt\nmorning, one or two fried vadais were also served by the attendants. I\nim=\r\nagined that fried vadais were indigestible and so I told Sri Ramana that I\n=\r\nwas afraid to eat vadai. That was the first occasion when I had the courage=\r\n\nto talk to him in the dining room. The sage looked at me with his\ndelightf=\r\nully pleasing eyes and said, &quot;You will digest it. You may eat.&quot; Then\nmy fea=\r\nrs fled away and I ate the vadais without suffering any indigestion.\n\nAfter=\r\n the breakfast was finished, I purchased a photo of Sri Ramana from the\nboo=\r\nkstall of the ashram. I desired to get it from the hands of the sage\nhimsel=\r\nf. Carrying it in my hands I went into the hall and prostrated to Sri\nRaman=\r\na, who was seated in jagrat state. There was no one else in the hall on\ntha=\r\nt occasion. That was a surprise to me. I told him that I had purchased\nhis =\r\nphoto and that I desired to receive it from his hands. Having said so, I\nga=\r\nve the photo to him. He graciously stretched his hands and took it from me\n=\r\nand looked at it for half a minute without saying any word by word of mouth=\r\n.\nHe was pleased to give it back to me. I received it with great satisfacti=\r\non.\n\nSource: http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/1995/?pg=3Djan-feb\n\n-- \n=\r\n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=\r\n=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=\r\n=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0016368e2962635a8b048a74dd4c\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nIn 1937, T.

On that morning, I took my breakfast sitting=\r\n in front of Sri Ramana in the same dining room. Many other guests were als=\r\no present. Some of them were newcomers.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bol=\r\nd&quot;&gt;The usual breakfast of iddli and sambar and hot coffee was finished in t=\r\nen minutes.
