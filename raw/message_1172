Mind w=\r\nill stop thinking only when it is in samadhi. Until then, it will continue =\r\nto get some good thoughts and some bad thoughts. That is its nature.\n \nThe =\r\ngoal of sadhana is to train the mind to focus on one thing. Some may train =\r\nthe mind to focus on a mantra. Some may train the mind to focus on musical =\r\nnotes. Some may train the mind to focus on the breathing. In various types =\r\nof spiritual sadhana, you have one object for the mind to focus on. Still, =\r\nmind tries to wander off all the time.\n \nIf a computer is running a program=\r\n and a virus or spyware or adware starts running, an anti-virus program&#39;s w=\r\natchdog task that is running in the same computer detects it and deletes it=\r\n (before it does much harm). Similarly, install a watchdog task in your min=\r\nd. Suppose you are meditating or doing some sadhana and trying to focus the=\r\n mind on something. Suppose some other (good or bad!) thoughts come to the =\r\nmind. As soon as you are aware of it (i.e. the watchdog task detects them),=\r\n simply delete the thoughts.\n \nI recommend not getting aggravated or frustr=\r\nated at the bad thoughts. Just become aware of them and tell yourself to fo=\r\ncus on the mantra. It is *natural* for the mind to be thinking of those bad=\r\n thoughts. By being aggravated or frustrated, you are only increasing the d=\r\nistraction. It is like picking fight with a heckler who interrupts a speech=\r\n you are giving or a song you are singing. Become aware and move on. If you=\r\n pick a fight with the heckler it does more harm than the original heckling=\r\n!\n \nBy being aware of the distraction, acknowledging it and then consciousl=\r\ny trying to ignore it, you are maximizing your chances of successfully retu=\r\nrning the full attention of the mind to the mantra. Of course, the distract=\r\nion will keep coming again and again. But the best option is to tell your m=\r\nind to focus on the mantra each time you are aware of the distraction. Do N=\r\nOT get frustrated. As you keep doing this over and over and over, the heckl=\r\ner may decide to shut up. Similarly, as you ignore distractions of the mind=\r\n, eventually oneday a pleasant accident will happen and mind will achieve a=\r\nbsolute focus on the mantra, with no other thoughts! THAT is when you exper=\r\nience the mantra and deity. Until then, it is a rehearsal.\n \nAll thoughts -=\r\n good or bad - are distractions. When you are meditating with a mantra, the=\r\n mind should be focused on ONE thing. That one thing can be the sound of th=\r\ne mantra or an image of the deity you have in your mind or a thought that &quot;=\r\nso and so deity is supreme. I am an insignificant servant&quot; etc. Try to focu=\r\ns your mind on that one focus point. As other thoughts come, become aware a=\r\nnd move on without any frustration or sadness or anger or disappointment.\n =\r\n\nOriginal mail said: &quot;In my heart I definetly do not want them to materiali=\r\nze.&quot;. Please realize that one&#39;s thinking or not thinking of something has n=\r\nothing to do with something happening or not happening. Thinking that you m=\r\nake several things happen, that there is a cause-effect relationship betwee=\r\nn various things in the universe and you have a role in it is an unnecessar=\r\ny burden. Tell yourself that She (or He) does it all and you are just an in=\r\nsignificant servant who happens to be there observing it all. It is a simpl=\r\ner world view and one that does not burden you.

I feel I have \n=\r\n        double minds. One is reading Chandipath or doing Japam and other mi=\r\nnd is \n        thinking on various thoughts. Is it possible that we have tw=\r\no minds at a \n        time? Because when we think on other issues while rea=\r\nding Chandipath, \n        the first mind reading Path is not at all stopped=\r\n. Path is going on \n        mentally.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DVerdana&gt;Dr. Ashwin Rawal&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Wed, \n        2/11/09, =\r\nsbm_sharma &lt;I&gt;&lt;sbm_sharma@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; \n        wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n        &lt;BLOCKQUOTE \n        style=3D&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px=\r\n; BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;From: \n          sbm_sharma &lt;sb=\r\nm_sharma@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] \n          Contending wit=\r\nh highly negative thoughts during Japa&lt;BR&gt;To: \n          vedic-wisdom@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Wednesday, February 11, 2009, \n          5:18 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;\n          &lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1337063509&gt;\n          &lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n       =\r\n   &lt;DIV&gt;Dear Narasimha,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Namaskar&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thank you for answering \n   =\r\n       all my queries.

In my heart I definetly do not=\r\n want them to \n          materialize. How should I &lt;BR&gt;proceed? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ple=\r\nase \n          advise.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thank you yet \n        again.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML=\r\n&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0354_01C98D61.6B4555E0--\r\n\n"}}
