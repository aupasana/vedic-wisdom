Any thought or action with which you identify strongly does become \na karma for future. But some karmas are good and their fruits are sweet, \nwhile some karmas are bad and and their fruits are bitter. Thinking of good \nto someone or doing good to someone is a good karma. Thinking of your good \nand hurting someone else is a bad karma. So do not worry about karmik \nconsequences when you genuinely feel compassion for someone.\n\n&gt; And news chanals are telling that the year 2012 is the END of Kali\n&gt; Yuga. may it is real? and all this are the hints before ending of Kali\n&gt; yuga. If it is so, what is our right now duty? may i expect any\n&gt; suggestion form Narsimharao Guru.\n\nThough the prophesy of Mayan civilization seems to refer to 2012 Dec 21, I \nsee the planetary position around 2012 Dec 12-13 as more interesting. I can \nsee why some seers from ancient civilizations may have anticipated big \nchanges at this time.\n\nHowever, I see no apocalypse or end of world as some prophesize. We are \nabout 5,000 years into Kali yuga and another 427,000 years are left. \nHowever, Kali may have brought some changes too fast and Nature may want us \nto slow things down. It is my expectation that some transformation will take \nplace in our world in the coming 10 years and 2012 may indeed be an \ninteresting year. But I see nothing to fear. I see a better phase within \nKali yuga setting in during the next decade or two. Worry about nothing, \nleave things to Her and do your individual dharma sincerely without thinking \ntoo much about either the past or the future.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;harikishan1962&quot; &lt;harikishan1962@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, May 24, 2009 7:34 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Happenings around the world\n\n\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;suvarnatejas&quot; &lt;suvarnatejas@...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dear Sir:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I find the happenings in lankapuri to be very sobering with\n&gt;&gt; millions displaced and losing contact with their children,\n&gt;&gt; and suffering in so many ways.\n&gt;&gt; Truly this shouldn&#39;t have been the fate of people who live\n&gt;&gt; in the land touched by Rama and Hanumanta&#39;s feet.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; At the same time, is there any value in our praying for this?\n&gt;&gt; If this is truly the Lord in his Kaala avatara forcing his will,\n&gt;&gt; will our prayers help?
