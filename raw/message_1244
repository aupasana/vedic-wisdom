A spritual \naspirant should start &#39;Puja&#39; or Sadhana without thinking =\r\ntoo much of \nexternalities like cleaniness, posture, room, M C etc. As one =\r\n\nprogresses, one learns what is good for him/her. Such is marvelous \nway of=\r\n God, who imparts neccessary and commensurate knowledge to \nsadhaka. More o=\r\nne is in sadhana, more one learns about correct method \nof sadhana. What is=\r\n of utmost importance is &#39;devotion&#39; to god. \nGreater the devotion, greater =\r\ndegree of learning. This knowledge is \nbuilt in &#39;SELF&#39; as u progress, self =\r\nbecomes prominent, and thus \nknowledge thorugh subtle ways is revealed to i=\r\nndividual. \n\nBut above does not discount the importance of formal knowledge=\r\n of \nsadhana and puja. That helps a lot. But it sometimes happen that \npeop=\r\nle get bogged down by extenalities.\n\nRegards,\nSanjeev\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; Deities are accompanied by various celestial beings. For example, \nthe di=\r\nvine Mother has several attendants (e.g. Jaya, Vijaya, Jayanti, \nAparajita =\r\netc).\n&gt;  \n&gt; According to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Sarada Mata was born with=\r\n an \namsa of Bagalamukhi and some of his sishyas like Yogin Ma, Golap Ma \ne=\r\ntc were born with an amsa of Jaya, Vijaya etc. They took care of \nSarada Ma=\r\nta. These celestial attendants are born as human beings when \ngod is born a=\r\ns a human being.\n&gt;  \n&gt; As one&#39;s sadhana for a deity progresses, that deity&#39;=\r\ns attendants \nmay visit one in celestial form (one may or may not realize i=\r\nt).\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, one should not think of all these things. It is ok to be=\r\n \naware of the possibilities and, if a result occurs, it is ok to take \ncog=\r\nnisance of it. But, expecting and looking forward to a result \ncorrupts the=\r\n sadhana. The sadhana one engages in should be an \noffering to god without =\r\nanything *expected* in return. Such sadhana \nbegets the highest fruits.\n&gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; Moreover, whether one was visited by a deity&#39;s attendants or not is \nnot=\r\n really a measure of one&#39;s progress. One&#39;s progress is judged from \nthe int=\r\nernal transformation. When someone praises you (correctly or \nincorrectly, =\r\ndoes not matter), does it make you proud? Of course, one \nmay act humble ex=\r\nternally and yet feel proud internally. I am talking \nabout the internal fe=\r\nelings here. Similarly, when someone criticizes \nyou (correctly or incorrec=\r\ntly, does not matter), does it make you \nunhappy or angry? One may not show=\r\n it externally and yet feel those \nemotions internally. I am talking about =\r\nthe internal feelings here. \nSpiritual sadhana is about overcoming internal=\r\n enemies and weaknesses \nand reaching the state of sthita prajnataa. Anythi=\r\nng else that \nhappens externally is secondary and a coincidence.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best=\r\n regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana=\r\n\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish =\r\nlessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (=\r\nWindows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) websi=\r\nte: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -----------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: A=\r\nshwin Rawal \n&gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, Feb=\r\nruary 18, 2009 1:15 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: M.C.

Though most higher deities do not =\r\ncare about this, their \nattendants may be sensitive. When you do a sadhana,=\r\n an attendant of a \ndeity may visit at first. One can try to make the visit=\r\nors \ncomfortable.\n&gt; \n&gt;           However, there may be so many other offens=\r\nive things \nwhere we do sadhana these days and putting too much stress on o=\r\nne \nlittle thing is somewhat unbalanced. You can try to follow tradition \ni=\r\nf that is possible. Otherwise, don&#39;t worry.\n&gt; \n&gt;           Regarding cookin=\r\ng food, the food we eat now-a-days is so \nbadly corrupted in various ways t=\r\nhat being cooked by a lady with \nperiods is a very small thing in compariso=\r\nn. Coming into the pooja \nroom is also not a big deal in my view.\n&gt; \n&gt;     =\r\n      However, when you do homam, I suggest not using food \ncooked by such =\r\na lady if possible. Also I suggest that ladies with \nperiods should not com=\r\ne too close to the fire. These are \nprecautionary suggestions only.\n&gt; \n&gt;   =\r\n        Chandipath is fine.
