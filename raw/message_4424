He who thinks =E2=80=98I (am=\r\n so-and-so)=E2=80=99 is himself one among the thoughts. Of\nall thoughts, th=\r\ne thought =E2=80=98I (am so-andso)=E2=80=99 is the very first. The jiva who=\r\n\nthinks =E2=80=98I (am so-and- -so)=E2=80=99 is only our reflection. For, w=\r\ne never think =E2=80=98I\n(am this or that)=E2=80=99 when we shine as That (=\r\nthe Supreme).\n\n4. This thought, =E2=80=98I (am the body)=E2=80=99, does not=\r\n exist in deep sleep. This\nthought, =E2=80=98I (am the body)=E2=80=99, does=\r\n not exist in the true state of jnana\neither. Since it rises and slips away=\r\n in between (two such states), this =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99\nis unreal;hence, th=\r\nis =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 is only a thought.\n\n5. The waxing of this thought =\r\n=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 is indeed the waxing of misery! This\nthought =E2=80=98I=\r\n=E2=80=99 alone is what is called the ego.It is only because of\nnon-enquiry=\r\n that this =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 has come into existence and is flourishing !=\r\n If,\ninstead of being favoured, it is enquired into, =E2=80=98What is this =\r\n!?=E2=80=99, it will\ndisappear, losing its existence.\n\n6. The second and th=\r\nird persons (the objects) live only because of the root,\nthe first person (=\r\nthe subject or ego).If the fickle mind turns towards the\nfirst person, the =\r\nfirst person will become non-existent and That which\nreally exists will the=\r\nn shine forth. This indestructible, real Self is\nJnana.\n\n7. To think of sec=\r\nond and third persons is sheer foolishness, for by\nthinking of second and t=\r\nhird persons the mental activities (mano-vritlis)\nwill wax. (On the other h=\r\nand,) attending to the first person is equal to\ncommitting suicide, for onl=\r\ny by enquiring into the first person will the ego\nitself die.\n\n8. Attending=\r\n to second and third persons instead of turning towards and\nattending to th=\r\ne first person is an attention based only upon ignorance\n(ajnana). If you a=\r\nsk, =E2=80=9CThen is not the attention to the ego also an\nattention based u=\r\npon ignorance? So why should we attend to this =E2=80=98I?=E2=80=99, then\nl=\r\nisten.\n\n9. The reason why this =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 dies when enquired into,=\r\n =E2=80=98What am I? is as\nfollows: This thought =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 is a r=\r\neflected ray of Jnana (Self), (and it alone\nis directly connected with Self=\r\n, whereas the other thoughts are not); (so)\nwhen the attention goes deeper =\r\nand deeper within along the ray =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, its\nlength decreases m=\r\nore and more, and when the ray I=E2=80=99 dies that which shines\nas =E2=80=\r\n=98I=E2=80=99 is Jnana.\n\n10. Do not perform any action thinking =E2=80=98It=\r\n should be done by me=E2=80=99. Nothing is\ndone by you, (for) you are simpl=\r\ny nothing ! By knowing this first, if you\navoid the rising of doership, the=\r\nn everything will be done well by Him and\nyour peace will remain undisturbe=\r\nd !\n\n11. When scrutinizing =E2=80=98What is real?=E2=80=99, nothing in the =\r\nworld is (found to be)\nreal; Self alone is real (satyam).Therefore, let us =\r\nrenounce everything and\never remain unshakably as the reality (sat).
