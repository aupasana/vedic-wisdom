For example, your satyanarayana puja manual=\r\n says\n&quot;place the kalasha on some grains of rice&quot;.\n\nOften, a large amount of=\r\n rice grains is used. During the puja process,\nbits of flowers and various =\r\nother odds and ends end up getting strewn\non top of the rice. After the puj=\r\na ends, all of this is mostly\nunceremoniously discarded.\n\nIt there a symbol=\r\nic spiritual reason behind placing rice under the\nkalasha? Or it is just a =\r\npractical reason --  kalashas usually have a\nrounded bottom, and the floor =\r\nis not always flat. Placing it on a bed\nof rice grains gives the kalasha so=\r\nme stability.\n\nsasneham,\n\n=A0 =A0ajit\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Sat, Feb 18, 2012 at 8:26 AM,=\r\n Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt;\n&gt; This is =\r\nan age of growing populations and food shortages.
