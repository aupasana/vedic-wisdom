Aren&#39;t we worshipping that creator through his/her creation which could=\r\n be a stone or something that we created out of our imagination (which agai=\r\nn is his/her manifestation) like gramadevatas?  Based on your explanation, =\r\nGramadevatas could very well be the projections of someone&#39;s imaginations, =\r\nwhich are equally true to the person who percieved them as Mahalakshmi or D=\r\nurga to most of us.  Am I totally off on this?\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Here are m=\r\ny 2 cents. I am cc&#39;ing the list keeping your anonymity. Great questions BTW=\r\n!\n&gt;  \n&gt; (1) Durga literally means a fort. Goddess Durga creates a formidabl=\r\ne fort around the individualized consciousness and that fort protects it fr=\r\nom attacks by internal enemies and also from one&#39;s own conditioning. When a=\r\n sadhaka is protected by Durga from all ten directions, one&#39;s conditioning =\r\ncannot attack one from any of the ten directions.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Of course, we are n=\r\not just talking about the physical directions here and talking about the di=\r\nrections taken in life, in terms of one&#39;s actions and work. Those who know =\r\nJyotish may recall that Maharshi Parasara mentions the rulers of ten direct=\r\nions as the rulers of ten parts in a chart known as &quot;dasaamsa chakra&quot;, whic=\r\nh, according to Parasara, shows the work done by one. Indra, the ruler of e=\r\nast, shows administrative work. Agni, the ruler of southeast, shows transfo=\r\nrmative work. Yama, the ruler of south, shows disciplinary work. Nirriti, t=\r\nhe ruler of southwest, shows pathbreaking work. And so on.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Each of Du=\r\nrga&#39;s hands represents one direction and shows killing pride and other such=\r\n ignorant notions coming from work of a certain type. When Durga is protect=\r\ning one&#39;s consciousness with all ten hands, one may do any kind of work and=\r\n yet remain untouched by pride, anger, shame and such notions stemming from=\r\n conditioning. In other words, one performs actions with detachment.\n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\nNow, you may note that the above form is the beeja (seed) for the madhyama =\r\ncharitra of Devi Saptashati! Eighteen handed Mahalakshmi is its devata and =\r\nthe actual killer of Mahishasura, as you correctly say, as per Chandipath. =\r\nMahisha literally means the mighty one. Mahishasura personifies our tendenc=\r\ny to feel mighty or great. When mother Durga creates a durga (fort) around =\r\none&#39;s consciousness and protects from all directions, the seed is sowed for=\r\n the killing of the tendency towards self-importance and pride.\n&gt;  \n&gt; That =\r\nresults in the establishment of the eighteen-handed form of Mahalskshmi wit=\r\nhin one&#39;s consciousness. The eighteen hands represent eighteen virtues, whi=\r\nch are the signs of a liberated being. They stem from the solar (push) and =\r\nlunar (pull) principles applied to the nine qualities represented by nine g=\r\nrahas (consciousness grabbers). When eighteen-handed Mahalakshmi is establi=\r\nshed in one&#39;s consciousness, it means that one&#39;s consciousness is endowed w=\r\nith these eighteen virtues and one is unaffected by the tendency towards se=\r\nlf-importance and pride. That means the formidable demon Mahisha is dead!\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; Whether the ten-handed Durga killed him or the eighteen-handed Mahalak=\r\nshmi killed him is a theoretical question. Both are not that different. One=\r\n does the groundwork and sows the seed and the other arises to finish off t=\r\nhe job.\n&gt;  \n&gt; (2) Durga&#39;s vehicle lion represents the tenacity and dharmaba=\r\nddhata (being bound by righteousness) of the sadhaka. The formation of prot=\r\nective fort around one&#39;s consciousness rides upon one&#39;s tenacity and commit=\r\nment.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Lion is a better symbol of those qualities, but tiger is not ba=\r\nd either. If you need advice, I say stick to lion. But, even those who imag=\r\nine her riding a tiger are not doing too bad. At the end, it is a symbol. I=\r\nf Durga were to really come and bless you, you would first show tenacity an=\r\nd commitment to dharma over a period of time and your consciousness will st=\r\nart to be guarded from the tendency to feel proud.\n&gt;  \n&gt; (3) I am not sure =\r\nof this.\n&gt;  \n&gt; (4) There are millions of forms described in scriptures! The=\r\n few famous ones are only samples. There are many many many many more.\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; If I am sincerely desirous of experiencing the divine and imagine a form =\r\nfor that purpose, how likely is it that this is not any of the forms create=\r\nd and worshipped by rishis in the past? My friend, we are all characters fr=\r\nom a nested dream sequence that finally traces back to the Creator. Our cre=\r\nativity finally traces back to the Creator. Even if I think I am imagining =\r\na new form that nobody ever imagined, I am most likely imagining something =\r\nthat was considered by the Creator or a rishi long back.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Of course, i=\r\nf you prefer, please stick to one of the forms described in one of the scri=\r\nptures you have read. That is fine. But, if someone else is imagining a for=\r\nm that you are not aware of, you may not worry about that person! In the en=\r\nd, the person will experience something if one is ready and not experience =\r\nanything if one is unready.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free Jyotish S=\r\noftware, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; Free &quot;Do It You=\r\nrself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                 =\r\n    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;        Films that make a difference: h=\r\nttp://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;        Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/gro=\r\nup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;     Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyoti=\r\nshWritings\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; \n&gt; Lately, a few queries have been bugg=\r\ning me. As usual, the only place I can run \n&gt; to with queries is you!\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n1) I have often wondered about the worship of Durga as prevalent in Bengal.=\r\n The \n&gt; deity is called Mahisasuramardini. Ths is as per Chandi, same as as=\r\ndasabhujya \n&gt; Mahalakshmi. But, the idols of durga are made wth 10 hands. D=\r\no you think this is \n&gt; a mistake?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) A lot of people specially in Delh=\r\ni worship a Goddess riding a tiger. I could \n&gt; not find anywhere any mentio=\r\nn of such a deity. Durga rides a lion. This worship \n&gt; is done during Navra=\r\ntri. Agan, is this a mistake?\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) Similarly people worship Santoshi Ma,=\r\n but who is this deity? I am totally \n&gt; confused. Similarly if one goes int=\r\no villages one finds all kinds of deities - \n&gt; mostly female - wth all kind=\r\ns of names. Like in Maharastra they have gaondevis - \n&gt; villages goddesses.=\r\n Where did these deities arrive from? Scriptures have no \n&gt; mention of thes=\r\ne..\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) Of course, even if one picks up a stone from the road and keeps=\r\n worshipping \n&gt; it, over time it can acquire some shaktih and produce resul=\r\nts. In that way, all \n&gt; idols and any conceptions are ok. But if that is ca=\r\nse, what is the necessity of \n&gt; providing correct visualization in teh shas=\r\ntras? My lilttle understanding says, \n&gt; one cannot create deity, but worshi=\r\np a deity who has already been created by \n&gt; Rishis using the root energy o=\r\nf the Universe. A deity is like a archetype of \n&gt; some aspect of the root e=\r\nnergy. And if the shastras are correct, then what is \n&gt; the use of worshipp=\r\ning to a form that is not that of an accepted deity? It \n&gt; should not produ=\r\nce any result logically...\n&gt; \n&gt; Worshipping deities is wonder in my little =\r\nexperience but sometimes it can get \n&gt; logically confusing!\n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;=\r\n &lt;deleted&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
