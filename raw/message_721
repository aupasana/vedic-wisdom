Doing it in the open is actually\nbetter than doing it in closed space. =\r\nBut realize that a rain can\ncause problems. Keep an umbrella around to prot=\r\nect the fire if it\nrains while you are doing homam. It is not good if fire =\r\nis\nextinguished by rain in the middle of a homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, you can constru=\r\nct a homa kundam with bricks and sand at the\nbottom. Use a square shaped hu=\r\nma kunda.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2)While performing the Homam using the mp3 audio file, sho=\r\nuld one\nrepeat the\n&gt; &gt; mantras mentally along with the audio?\n&gt; \n&gt; One can =\r\nrepeat mentally while listening attentively (not casually).\nActually, even =\r\nlistening to mantras with all the attention focused is\nas powerful as sayin=\r\ng mantras.\n&gt; \n&gt; Suppose person X is chanting a mantra and thinking of some =\r\nmundane\nmatter in the mind. Suppose person Y is listening to it with focus =\r\nand\nthinking of the mantra and its deity. Then the mantra may do nothing\nfo=\r\nr person X and yet person Y may benefit from the mantra. The word\nmantra me=\r\nans &quot;one that protects the mind&quot;. One can say a mantra or\nlisten to a mantr=\r\na, to be protected. The key is control over the mind\nand keeping the mind f=\r\nocused on the mantra.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, there is a difference between meditatio=\r\nn and homam. Mantra\nis submitted in the internal fire in meditation and it =\r\nis submitted in\nthe external fire as well in a homam. So making some extern=\r\nal sound\n(even if feeble) is a good idea as opposed to silent chanting or j=\r\nust\nlistening. Try to repeat slowly.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapat=\r\ni Homam? Any Other\nconditions/niyamas that\n&gt; &gt; should be followed apart fro=\r\nm having vegeterain food?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread=\r\n ceremony) has been\nperformed can do it. Bachelor or married is irrelevant.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; One should follow the yamas and niyamas set by one&#39;s guru. Whatever\nr=\r\nules one&#39;s guru sets, one should follow them strictly. At the\nminimum, one =\r\nshould eat only vegetarian food on the day of homam and\ntake a bath before =\r\nhomam. Another rule I will recommend is to avoid\neating any solid food 2 ho=\r\nurs before homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, if one without a sacred thread wants to =\r\ndo homam for\nspiritual progress, I am willing to take responsibility and al=\r\nlow them\nto do it. Such a person can think of me or my guru as guru and per=\r\nform\nhomam. I am willing to take on any karma incurred in the process until=\r\n\nthe person crosses some minimum threshhold of purity through homam and\noth=\r\ner spiritual practices. Sacred thread or no sacred thread,\nmantropadesa or =\r\nno mantropadesa, it does not matter after a while,\nwhen the person crosses =\r\na threshhold of purity. The goal of upanayanam\nand other mantropadesa by gu=\r\nru is to speed this up and make the person\ncross the threshhold of purity.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; As long as one desires no specific material benefits (and ready to\nrec=\r\neive whatever god gives) and does homam for spiritual progress, I\nam willin=\r\ng to help, even if it means some suffering for me.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4)Any good date t=\r\no start the Homam? or any day would be fine?\n&gt; \n&gt; For Mahaganapathi homam, =\r\nthe best is a Chaturthi morning. But any\nday is fine really.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Mentioning rain and rooftop homam reminded me of my India trip.\n&gt; \n&gt; When=\r\n I went to India in May 2008, I and my guru Manish traveled\ntogether to sev=\r\neral places (on a specific project). We ended up doing\nhomam in the morning=\r\n in several places (wherever we were). Before the\ntrip, my guru told me to =\r\ncarry an umbrella with me. As monsoons come\nonly in June/July in India, I d=\r\nid not take it seriously. We were in\nNew Delhi in mid-May. We proceeded to =\r\nthe rooftop of the apartment\ncomplex we were in, to do a homam. Manish told=\r\n me, &quot;Narasimha, it is\ngoing to rain heavily in this city after our homam f=\r\ninishes&quot;. I just\nsmiled.\n&gt; \n&gt; To my surprise, it did rain as soon as our ho=\r\nmas finished. After we\noffered poornaahuti, it suddenly started raining wit=\r\nh really big\ndrops. Luckily, there was a small towel/blanket on the rooftop=\r\n close\nto us. Together, we held it on top of the two small homa kundas,\nclo=\r\nsed our eyes and meditated. We held the cloth cover on the homa\nkundas unti=\r\nl fire in the two homa kundas went off and then packed\neverything and went =\r\ndown. We left for Kurukshetra later that day, but\nwe were told that a heavy=\r\n rain continued for a few days in New Delhi.\nIn fact, rain followed us on t=\r\nhat trip as we covered the north, east\nand west of India. It rained in ever=\r\ny place we went to, as we finished\nour task in that place and prepared to m=\r\nove on.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst r=\r\nologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- =\r\nwisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt;=\r\n Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jag=\r\nannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; ------------ --=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; \n&gt; ---- Phanikumar Vela=\r\nga &lt;itsverysimple@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Namasthe,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am intereste=\r\nd in doing Maha Ganapati Homam daily, and have few\nquestions\n&gt; &gt; regarding =\r\nit.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of a house(3-floors) =\r\n?\nCan a homam\n&gt; &gt; kundam made by arranging red bricks, with sand base be us=\r\ned\ninstead of a\n&gt; &gt; copper one?\n&gt; &gt; 2)While performing the Homam using the =\r\nmp3 audio file, should one\nrepeat the\n&gt; &gt; mantras mentally along with the a=\r\nudio?\n&gt; &gt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam?

The key is control over the mind&lt;BR&gt;and keeping the mind foc=\r\nused on the mantra.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; However, there is a difference between=\r\n meditation and homam. Mantra&lt;BR&gt;is submitted in the internal fire in medit=\r\nation and it is submitted in&lt;BR&gt;the external\n fire as well in a homam. So m=\r\naking some external sound&lt;BR&gt;(even if feeble) is a good idea as opposed to =\r\nsilent chanting or just&lt;BR&gt;listening. Try to repeat slowly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Other&lt;BR&gt;conditions/niya=\r\nmas that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; should be followed apart from having vegeterain food?=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Yes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread ceremony) ha=\r\ns been&lt;BR&gt;performed can do it. Bachelor or married is irrelevant.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; One should follow the yamas and niyamas set by one&#39;s guru. Whatever=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;rules one&#39;s guru sets, one should follow them strictly. At the&lt;BR&gt;minim=\r\num, one should eat only vegetarian food on the day of homam and&lt;BR&gt;take a b=\r\nath before homam. Another rule I will recommend is to avoid&lt;BR&gt;eating any s=\r\nolid food 2 hours before homam.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; By the way, if one without=\r\n a sacred thread wants to do homam for&lt;BR&gt;spiritual progress, I am willing =\r\nto take responsibility and allow\n them&lt;BR&gt;to do it. Such a person can think=\r\n of me or my guru as guru and perform&lt;BR&gt;homam. I am willing to take on any=\r\n karma incurred in the process until&lt;BR&gt;the person crosses some minimum thr=\r\neshhold of purity through homam and&lt;BR&gt;other spiritual practices. Sacred th=\r\nread or no sacred thread,&lt;BR&gt;mantropadesa or no mantropadesa, it does not m=\r\natter after a while,&lt;BR&gt;when the person crosses a threshhold of purity. The=\r\n goal of upanayanam&lt;BR&gt;and other mantropadesa by guru is to speed this up a=\r\nnd make the person&lt;BR&gt;cross the threshhold of purity.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; As l=\r\nong as one desires no specific material benefits (and ready to&lt;BR&gt;receive w=\r\nhatever god gives) and does homam for spiritual progress, I&lt;BR&gt;am willing t=\r\no help, even if it means some suffering for me.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 4)Any=\r\n good date to start the Homam? or any day would be fine?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; F=\r\nor Mahaganapathi homam, the best is a Chaturthi morning. But any&lt;BR&gt;day is =\r\nfine really.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mentioning rain and r=\r\nooftop homam reminded me of my India trip.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When I went to =\r\nIndia in May 2008, I and my guru Manish traveled&lt;BR&gt;together to several pla=\r\nces (on a specific project). We ended up doing&lt;BR&gt;homam in the morning in s=\r\neveral places (wherever we were). Before the&lt;BR&gt;trip, my guru told me to ca=\r\nrry an umbrella with me. As monsoons come&lt;BR&gt;only in June/July in India, I =\r\ndid not take it seriously. We were in&lt;BR&gt;New Delhi in mid-May. We proceeded=\r\n to the rooftop of the apartment&lt;BR&gt;complex we were in, to do a homam. Mani=\r\nsh told me, &quot;Narasimha, it is&lt;BR&gt;going to rain heavily in this city after o=\r\nur homam finishes&quot;. I just&lt;BR&gt;smiled.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; To my surprise, it d=\r\nid rain as soon as our homas finished. After we&lt;BR&gt;offered poornaahuti, it =\r\nsuddenly started raining with really big&lt;BR&gt;drops. Luckily, there was a sma=\r\nll towel/blanket on the rooftop close&lt;BR&gt;to us. Together, we held it on top=\r\n of the two\n small homa kundas,&lt;BR&gt;closed our eyes and meditated. We held t=\r\nhe cloth cover on the homa&lt;BR&gt;kundas until fire in the two homa kundas went=\r\n off and then packed&lt;BR&gt;everything and went down. We left for Kurukshetra l=\r\nater that day, but&lt;BR&gt;we were told that a heavy rain continued for a few da=\r\nys in New Delhi.&lt;BR&gt;In fact, rain followed us on that trip as we covered th=\r\ne north, east&lt;BR&gt;and west of India. It rained in every place we went to, as=\r\n we finished&lt;BR&gt;our task in that place and prepared to move on.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A h=\r\nref=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;=\r\nhttp://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A=\r\n&gt; rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; ta=\r\nrget=3D_blank\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wi=\r\nsdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro./&quot; ta=\r\nrget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;/A&gt; home.comcast. net&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Ja=\r\ngannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagan/&quot; target=3D_bl=\r\nank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;/A&gt; nath.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---- Pha=\r\nnikumar Velaga &lt;itsverysimple@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namast=\r\nhe,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I am interested in doing Maha Ganapati Homam=\r\n daily, and have few&lt;BR&gt;questions&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; regarding it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of a house(3-floors) =\r\n?&lt;BR&gt;Can a homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; kundam made by arranging red bricks, with san=\r\nd base be used&lt;BR&gt;instead\n of a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; copper one?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 2)Whi=\r\nle performing the Homam using the mp3 audio file, should one&lt;BR&gt;repeat the&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; mantras mentally along with the audio?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 3)Can bach=\r\nelors do Maha Ganapati Homam?
