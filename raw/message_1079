The other view is that anybody can do it.\n\nI subscribe to the later view.\n\nIf one&#39;s grandfather had some unfilfilled desires and one&#39;s father is alive, \nof course, one&#39;s father can offer tarpana. However, grandson can also do it. \nDepending on the karmic debts, the unfilled desires may have more effect on \nthe grandson than son and hence tarpana offered by grandson may work better \nthan tarpana offered by son. Thus, the idea that father has the exclusive \n&quot;right&quot; to tarpana and his son will get that right only after he passes away \nis illogical.\n\nIf a father is a rich man with a lot of money, son may not need to work. \nHowever, if father is not that rich, son should better work. Especially if \nfather is not capable of getting a good job and son is capable of getting a \ngood job, son should definitely find a job and work. Saying that only father \nshould work as long as he is alive and son should stay home is wrong. Same \nwith tarpana.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;damked&quot; &lt;damkedar@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, February 02, 2009 7:50 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Tarpan query\n\n\n&gt; Can a jivat-pitruk (one whose father is alive) carry out Tarpan?\n&gt;\n&gt; Kedar Damle\n\n\n"}}
