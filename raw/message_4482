She=\r\n\nmoved closely with Smt.Kannakammal for a number of years.\n\nWhen I read abo=\r\nut Kanakammal in Moments Remembered and then read her own\nCherished Memorie=\r\ns, I was thrilled to discover the beauty of her\nrelationship with Sri Bhaga=\r\nvan and the depth of her understanding of Sri\nBhagavan&#39;s way. But still no =\r\ndirect contact occurred until several years\nlater when I was asked to bring=\r\n Kanakammal in the taxi with me to Chennai\nwhere I was taking a flight back=\r\n to Europe. After leaving me at the airport,\nthe taxi would then take her t=\r\no her relatives&#39; house in the city.\n\nSri Bhagavan brought us together a few=\r\n years ago when my friend Joelle, from\nFrance, who had a very special rappo=\r\nrt with Kanakammal, invited me to attend\nclasses that Amma was going to giv=\r\ne on Sri Bhagavan&#39;s original works and\nscriptural translations that make up=\r\n the Tamil Parayana we sing at 6:30 in\nthe evening. In the classes Kanakamm=\r\nal would go through the commentary that\nshe had written in Tamil based on M=\r\nuruganar&#39;s explanations to her.\nKanakammal had apparently held classes for =\r\nIndian people in previous years\nand now her class would be translated into =\r\nEnglish.\n\nThe first year, somehow, I didn&#39;t feel the motivation to attend r=\r\negular\nclasses in the morning.\n\nWhen Joelle came back to Tiruvannamalai the=\r\n following year, I decided that\nthis time I would join the class. I soon re=\r\ngretted that I hadn&#39;t started\nearlier. We were a small, core group of ladie=\r\ns - Aparna, Dolly, Punita and\nMinakshi. Joelle and I were the only foreigne=\r\nrs, though sometimes Rumi would\njoin us and also some other visitors. Kanak=\r\nammal would speak in Tamil, but\nwe had the blessing of Aparna&#39;s outstanding=\r\n English translation.\n\nDuring that time I went almost daily into Kanakammal=\r\n&#39;s compound, placed my\nchappels out on the veranda under her window and had=\r\n my first glimpse of her\nsitting in her chair perfectly groomed, draped in =\r\na starched, light colored\nsari with an aura of deep contemplation surroundi=\r\nng her. She reminded me of\nmy grandmother in some ways. When I would peep i=\r\nn through the window she\nwould see me, smile and say, &quot;Vango, Vango&quot; (Come,=\r\n Come). Then we would\ngreet and I would sit on the floor and lean against t=\r\nhe wall.\n\nAs she knew that I had undergone back surgery, she always insiste=\r\nd that I\ntake and sit on the stool that she used to keep next to her chair.=\r\n As I took\nmy place I would look up at the photo of her as a young lady in =\r\nher early\n20s and think about how fortunate she was to in her early 20s and=\r\n think\nabout how fortunate she was to have come to Sri Bhagavan at that tim=\r\ne.\n\nSometimes I would arrive late to class and once she started laughing an=\r\nd\nsaid, &quot;She is Totakacharya.&quot; When I expressed my ignorance of who\nTotakac=\r\nharya was, I immediately got the story. Totaka was a devoted disciple\nof Ad=\r\ni Shankara, but the other disciples all looked down on him as being\nquite d=\r\null. Once when Adi Shankara waited for Totaka to arrive before he\nwould beg=\r\nin his daily discourse, the other disciples became impatient and\ncomplained=\r\n about having to wait for someone who didn&#39;t have the intellectual\ncapacity=\r\n to grasp the subtle points of the scriptures. When Totaka finally\narrived,=\r\n he was brimming over with bliss and dazzled the disciples by\nuttering a fe=\r\nw concise stanzas in Totaka metre that confirmed his complete\ngrasp of the =\r\nsubject matter.\n\nThis was our class: the commentary on Sri Bhagavan&#39;s works=\r\n was interwoven\nwith many colorful stories from various scriptures and pura=\r\nnas, stories that\nbrought the saints and sages to life, right into that sma=\r\nll room. This was\ninterwoven with her own experience of Sri Bhagavan, Murug=\r\nanar and other\nsenior devotees. At those times Bhagavan came alive and fill=\r\ned the room with\nhis Divine Presence.\n\nThrough her eyes, which were always =\r\nfixed on the Master, she gave us a\nprecious glimpse of those golden days. I=\r\n was thrilled when she told us once,\nwith a twinkle in her eye, that someti=\r\nmes it was stressful for her in those\ndays, particularly when the road was =\r\nfilled with water during the rainy\nseason and snakes would wind around her =\r\nlegs while she was walking to the\nashram, or when bandicoots and monkeys wo=\r\nuld come into her house through the\nopenings and sometimes even make off wi=\r\nth some clothing that had been left\nto dry. But then all of the difficultie=\r\ns she was experiencing would\nimmediately vanish as soon as she set foot int=\r\no the Old Hall and plunged\ninto Sri Bhagavan&#39;s graceful presence. Even thou=\r\ngh most of these experiences\nare recorded in Cherished Memories or have app=\r\neared in the Mountain Path,\nher speech would flood the room with the divine=\r\n consciousness and bliss of\nSri Bhagavan, as if he were with us then and th=\r\nere, showering his grace.\n\nAparna&#39;s talent as a translator was such a boon =\r\nfor those of us who are not\nproficient Tamil speakers.\n\nKanakammal used to =\r\ndelight at my attempts at communicating with her in\nTamil. She would speak =\r\nvery slowly as if I were a child, and then laugh.\nEvery time she would see =\r\nme in the ashram she would take both my hands and\nsay &quot;Eppadi Irukinga?&quot; (H=\r\now are you?) And I would reply, &quot;Nallarukku (fine)\nEppadi Irukinga?&quot; Then I=\r\n would sit down next to her in the back of Sri\nBhagavan&#39;s Samadhi Hall. Whe=\r\nn she could no longer sit on the floor because\nof leg pain, I would sit wit=\r\nh her along with some other devotees in the New\nHall where a chair was plac=\r\ned for her use. At first she felt that she should\nnot sit on a chair in the=\r\n Samadhi Hall. Only later on she accepted to sit on\na chair in the Samadhi =\r\nHall.\n\nShe always pushed us inward to grasp the essence of our being, the A=\r\ntman or\nSelf, or Summa irruku (Be still and know that &#39;I am&#39;). She didn&#39;t w=\r\nant us to\ncomplain about life&#39;s difficulties and problems. She said that li=\r\nke the dobi\n(washer man) who beats out the stains on dirty cloth, the Prese=\r\nnce of the\nGuru drives away the individual self (ego) so that the Atman can=\r\n be released\nand shine forth in all its glory. She firmly adhered to the fa=\r\nct that prayer\nto Sri Bhagavan was the ultimate solution to any of our prob=\r\nlems and\ndifficulties. She always insisted that the illusory individual can=\r\nnot do\nanything on his own and only through complete surrender (saranagati)=\r\n to Sri\nBhagavan, our Sadguru, and with his grace can we do our sadhana.\n\nK=\r\nanakammal was very strict that we should follow Bhagavan&#39;s direct path, and=\r\n\nonce she took me to task about my tendency to be overly attracted to\nritua=\r\nls. She was rather strong about insisting that I had come here to do\nAtma V=\r\nichara and that I should not deviate from the path. But at the same\ntime sh=\r\ne never missed evening puja at the ashram unless she was ill, out of\nTiruva=\r\nnamalai, or there was a heavy downpour.\n\nShe liked to visit temples also. O=\r\nnce she and I were part of a group that\nwent to Tirukoilur, and she was so =\r\nenthusiastic, like a young girl, as we\nvisited the different temples there.=\r\n Another time she took me aside during\none Navarathri celebration in the as=\r\nhram and said, &quot;Come to my house\ntomorrow morning, I want to make you a Suv=\r\nasini in Sri Bhagavan&#39;s presence.&quot;\nShe had Revati, her niece, decorate me i=\r\nn the traditional way and then gave\nme a sari, blouse and bangles. I&#39;ll nev=\r\ner forget that blessed morning\nsitting in front of Sri Bhagavan&#39;s photograp=\r\nh in her house. I was moved to\ntears.\n\nI feel privileged to have witnessed =\r\nher passing and can just say that I had\ntouched her body at that time and f=\r\nelt waves of bliss going through me that\npushed out any trace of sadness th=\r\nat I could have felt. What a beautiful end\nshe had!\n\nIt was a testimony to =\r\nher utter and supreme devotion to Sri Bhagavan. She\njust walked into Sri Bh=\r\nagavan&#39;s Samadhi on Jayanthi day before the puja\nstarted with her eyes fixe=\r\nd on the lingam and then dropped to the floor.\nSome devotees immediately ca=\r\nrried her outside near the meditation hall where\nwe sang &quot;Arunachala Siva&#39;&quot;=\r\n Where she actually left the body is not\nimportant.\n\nHer last words to me t=\r\nhe night before in the Samadhi Hall were &quot;Eppadi\nirrukinga?&quot; I replied, &quot;Na=\r\nlarukku.&quot;\n\nThen I asked, &quot;Eppadi irrukinga?&quot; and she said, &quot;Nalarukku. I be=\r\nlieve so.\nEverything is good.&quot;\n\nSource:\nhttp://www.arunachala.org/newslette=\r\nrs/2010/?pg=3Dmay-jun&t=3Dhtm#article.3\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=\r\n=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=\r\n=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=\r\n=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=\r\n=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd706d633e9d104895b1207\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Marye Tonnaire is an ardent dev=\r\notee who lives at Sri Ramanasramam, India.
