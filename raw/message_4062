I mean, I understand=\r\n each atman is just a piece of the ultimate, and that ideally we should be =\r\npraying for all of mankind.  Yet, have the rishis or anyone in our legacy e=\r\nver beseeched the gods on behalf of any individual?  And if the individual =\r\nis &#39;dead&#39; would that really matter as the atman is everlasting?\n\nI am not q=\r\nuite sure how to phrase what I want to ask.  My beloved mother passed away =\r\nseveral months ago and I feel that I should do something to wish her well i=\r\nn her journey toward the ultimate.  Is that wrong of me?  Is there anything=\r\n in Hinduism which speaks to that?\n\n-- Davyd\n\n\n\n"}}
