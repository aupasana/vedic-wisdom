He took\n&gt; &gt; Maha samadhi in Bombay and his Samad=\r\nhi is located in Phuskar \n&gt; &gt; Rajasthan.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Babaji is also know as Ra=\r\nnchod Dasji Maharaj, Paramhans of \n&gt; Chirtakut \n&gt; &gt; and some more names too=\r\n. He was a Maharatrian Deshasth brahmin by \n&gt; &gt; birth and was born in Gwail=\r\nor district in MP.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ranchod Dasji Maharaj name was given to him by =\r\nhis disciples in \n&gt; &gt; Gujarat.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He may have lived for 700 plus year=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He ran away from home at a very tender age and was taken up a \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; disciple by Bala Krishna Dasji also known as Paihari Baba.\n&gt; &gt; Paihari =\r\nbaba was also very releaized, he only drank milk and so \nthe \n&gt; &gt; name. Pai=\r\nhari Baba was Gujarati by birth but spoke in Hindi.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Paihari Baba l=\r\nived in Kulu for a long time, than in Pushkar, he \nwas \n&gt; &gt; in Pushkar when=\r\n the temple of Srinathji was moved from Mathura to \n&gt; &gt; Rajasthan. At that =\r\ntime he did a lot of seva of lord Krishna in \n&gt; &gt; Pushkar. \n&gt; &gt; After that =\r\nhe lived in Galtaji near jaipur in Rajasthan. \n&gt; &gt; Babaji also lived in Gal=\r\ntaji for about 12 years and he had the \n&gt; vision \n&gt; &gt; of Lord Rama in the s=\r\name cave, that exists today too.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is located a few miles from Ja=\r\nipur, there are a few temples \n&gt; there \n&gt; &gt; near the cave. I have visited t=\r\nhis cave too.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From Galtaji Paihari Baba moved to Revasa and than t=\r\no Kashmir \nwhere \n&gt; &gt; he lived in a place called &quot;Rasayani Gufa&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nPaihari Baba also may have lived for 500 plus years too.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; While at =\r\nGaltaji, the Famous Tulsidas maharaj had visited Paihari \n&gt; &gt; Baba and give=\r\n a hand written manuscipt of Ramayana.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; They belong to the Ramanand=\r\ni Sampradaya who has Lord Ram and \n&gt; Goddess \n&gt; &gt; Sita devi as ishta devata=\r\n.
