He was with Sri Bhagavan at the time =\r\nof\nHis Mahanirvana.\n\nThe following article has been extracted from the Janu=\r\nary 1973 issue of The\nMountain Path. It is a first person account of how th=\r\ne Swami was drawn to\nthe Maharshi and his recollections of serving Sri Bhag=\r\navan.\n\nI was born in 1916 in a village named Mavelikara in South Kerala. My=\r\n mother\nwho was of a pious disposition used to serve sadhus and was happy t=\r\no help\nthem in various ways. Her piety made me turn to the spiritual path w=\r\nhen I\nwas only eighteen but home I left later. Meanwhile I ran a small scho=\r\nol for\nchildren on the verandah of our house.\n\nAfter four years I went on a=\r\n pilgrimage to Rameswaram in the company of some\nsadhus. In the course of m=\r\ny pilgrimage I halted at an abode of sadhus called\nPandikkan Mazhi Matham s=\r\nituated between Madurai and Manamadurai. This matham\nwas managed by one Nar=\r\nayanaswami who had stayed at Sri Ramanasramam for some\ntime. He was the fir=\r\nst person who spoke to me about Sri Bhagavan and His\ngreatness. He wrote ou=\r\nt the full\naddress of Sri Ramanasramam on a piece of paper and gave it to m=\r\ne.\n\nFrom Rameswaram I came directly to Tiruvannamalai. This was in 1938. I =\r\nwas\novercome with joy when I saw Arunachala. After spending a few days at t=\r\nhe\nVirupaksha Cave I came down one day to Sri Ramanasramam in the company o=\r\nf a\nsadhu. When we arrived Sri Bhagavan had just returned from His afternoo=\r\nn\nwalk and was sitting in the hall alone. He looked at us and smiled. I can=\r\n\nnever forget that smile. After sitting in His presence for some time I\nret=\r\nurned to the cave. Thereafter I used to visit the Ashram daily and have\ndar=\r\nshan of Sri Bhagavan. I changed my abode from the Virupaksha Cave to the\nMa=\r\nngo tree Cave,Skandaramam, etc., from time to time and spent seven years\nin=\r\n this manner, begging my food in the town.\n\nI then obtained, by Sri Bhagava=\r\nn=E2=80=99s Grace, the good fortune of serving Him as\nHis personal attendan=\r\nt from 1946 till His final Nirvana on 14th April\n1950.One day Sri Bhagavan =\r\ndescribed to me how one Sadguru Swami from Kerala,\nunder the influence of s=\r\nome intoxicating drug, kept on embracing Him tightly\nsaying, =E2=80=9CYou a=\r\nre a good boy. It is a pleasure to see you.=E2=80=9D Sri Bhagavan\nacted the=\r\n part of the sadhu in His inimitable way while narrating the\nincident. I wa=\r\ns alone with Him at the time and still remember the scene with\njoy!\n\nI was =\r\npresent when the tumour on Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s arm was operated upon in\n=\r\n1949. Although I cannot stand the sight of blood I managed somehow to\ncontr=\r\nol myself. On the evening of the 14th of April 1950 we were massaging\nSri B=\r\nhagavan=E2=80=99s body. At about 5 o=E2=80=99clock He asked us to help Him =\r\nsit\nup.Precisely at that moment devotees started singing Arunachala\nSiva=E2=\r\n=80=94Arunachala Siva. When Sri Bhagavan heard this His face lit up with\nra=\r\ndiant joy.Tears began to flow from His eyes and continued to flow for a\nlon=\r\ng time. I was wiping them from time to time. I was also giving Him\nspoonful=\r\ns of water boiled with ginger. The doctor wanted to administer\nartificial r=\r\nespiration but Sri Bhagavan waved it away. He also wanted to\ngive some frui=\r\nt juice so I begged Sri Bhagavan to agree to this and when He\ngraciously co=\r\nnsented the doctor gave it to Him. Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s breathing\nbecame =\r\ngradually slower and slower and exactly at 8.47 p.m.subsided\nquietly. At th=\r\nat very moment, as is well known, devotees who were outside\nsaw a big,brigh=\r\nt meteor in the sky.\n\nI observed silence from 1950 to 1963. I have all thes=\r\ne years been feeding\nthe peacocks, monkeys and squirrels, a job that was al=\r\nways pleasing to Sri\nBhagavan. I also look after the room in which Sri Bhag=\r\navan attained Nirvana.\nI wish to end my life doing this service.\n\nSri Swami=\r\n Satyananda was absorbed in Arunachala on the evening of\nMonday,27th Novemb=\r\ner 1989.\n\nSource:\nhttp://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/pdf/Saranagathi_eNewslet=\r\nter_March_2010.pdf\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =\r\n=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=\r\n=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--005045015b5d7c67c5048a627ea9\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nSwami Satyananda was one of the attendants of Sri Bhagavan durin=\r\ng the last few years of His physical existence.
