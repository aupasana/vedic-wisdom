This attraction is\n&gt; termed devotion, Bhakti.\n&gt; =\r\n=E2=80&quot; Sivanandalahari, verse 61\n&gt; \n&gt; Kavyakantha: Will Maharshi please en=\r\nlighten us on the subject of Devotion\n&gt; (Bhakti)?\n&gt; \n&gt; Maharshi: To everyon=\r\ne the dearest object is himself. He loves himself\n&gt; always, and with the gr=\r\neatest love possible. Such an unbroken current of\n&gt; love, frequently compar=\r\ned in sacred books to a flowing stream of oil, is\n&gt; styled devotion, if it =\r\nis directed towards God.\n&gt; \n&gt; =E2=80=9CBhakti is the unshakeable attachment=\r\n to the Supreme God.=E2=80=9D =E2=80&quot; Shandilya\n&gt; Bhakti Sutras, verse 2\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Ordinarily people regard God as existing outside of themselves and as ha=\r\nving\n&gt; a personality like their own. The Jnani (enlightened sage) however r=\r\negards\n&gt; the personal God (also) as none other than himself; and Self-love,=\r\n in this\n&gt; case, is or becomes the love of God (personal).\n&gt; \n&gt; In his case=\r\n, devotion is defined as Self-realisation. Others, who treat the\n&gt; personal=\r\n God as something outside themselves develop deep devotion to such a\n&gt; God =\r\nand finally sink their personality in Him.\n&gt; \n&gt; The love-smitten chord of S=\r\nelf, trembles and passes in music out of sight. In\n&gt; fact, worship, nay, al=\r\nl intense concentrated thought or feeling, is the\n&gt; merging of the mind in =\r\nthe object worshipped or concentrated on. Intense\n&gt; faith in the personal G=\r\nod, however, carries the devotee easily and naturally\n&gt; to faith in and dev=\r\notion to the impersonal Absolute (Swarupa Brahman).\n&gt; \n&gt; Mostly, the beginn=\r\nings of devotion to (personal) God are traceable to a\n&gt; desire to avoid sor=\r\nrows and attain happiness. So, with great keenness and\n&gt; zest people approa=\r\nch their God, investing Him with name and form, and attain\n&gt; the objects th=\r\ney desire. Even after such attainment, the habit of devotion\n&gt; continues an=\r\nd the mind trained to worship God with form and name develops\n&gt; the power t=\r\no dwell on the Formless and Nameless.\n&gt; \n&gt; The evanescent objects achieved =\r\nby the first flow of devotion to a personal\n&gt; God do not fully satisfy the =\r\naspiring soul who thirsts after enduring\n&gt; happiness. With this ever new im=\r\npetus to seek something more than relative\n&gt; happiness, the progressing sou=\r\nl ultimately drops name and form as its object\n&gt; of contemplation and thus =\r\nattempts to conceive of or realise the Absolute\n&gt; (Brahman). Thus devotion =\r\nto a personal God gets transformed or ripened\n&gt; gradually into devotion to =\r\nthe Impersonal, which is the same as Vichara\n&gt; (enquiry) and Realisation.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Investigation into the Self is nothing other than devotion.\n&gt; =E2=80&quot; V=\r\nivekachudamani, verse 32\n&gt; \n&gt; Devotion may at the outset be by fits and sta=\r\nrts. That need not depress the\n&gt; aspirant, for it will develop and become s=\r\nteadier and flow finally in an\n&gt; unbroken current. When devotion (personal)=\r\n is ripe, a moment&#39;s instruction\n&gt; (Sravana) suffices for the next step in =\r\nJnana. Faith helps in the\n&gt; development of one&#39;s intuition and the attainme=\r\nnt of complete illumination =E2=80&quot;\n&gt; Cosmic Consciousness.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, the =\r\nweak aspirant&#39;s first efforts at devotion, through name and form\n&gt; at broke=\r\nn intervals, and for attaining finite or lower ends, ultimately\n&gt; carry him=\r\n beyond all name and form, into an unbroken current of love to the\n&gt; Absolu=\r\nte.
