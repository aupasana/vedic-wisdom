While we say that Lord Shiva is omnipresent,=\r\n omniscient etc. yet, if we go through the Pauranic literature then you wil=\r\nl notice that the divine forces are dual.\n\nAs per the Puranas; Lord Shiva i=\r\ns the destructive form of MahaShakti in Hinduism therefore called MahaKaala=\r\n.  He took birth from MahaShakti&#39;s nitamba therefore he is the tamasik God =\r\nbecause born from such a part.  The reason of his birth was to create the &quot;=\r\nmaithunik&quot; shrishti.\n\nIt is mentioned that when MahaShakti had the desire t=\r\no create the cosmic worlds then she created Vishnu (from her mind); Brahma =\r\n(from her heart) & Shiva from her nitamba.  All three of them were assigned=\r\n different duties i.e. Bhagwan Vishnu was assigned to protect the world wit=\r\nh his sattviK form; while Brahma was assigned the duty to create the world =\r\nwith his Rajasik form and Lord Shiva was assigned the duty to inhale the wo=\r\nrlds with his tamasik powers.\n\nWhile they perform different duties but they=\r\n are the merged form of MahaShakti, created by her only.\n\nThus, Shiva whose=\r\n birthday is celebrated is different from the one who is omnipresent/omnisc=\r\nient.\n\nRegards,\nPrakash Kandpal\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajya=\r\n laxmi &lt;rajyalaxmi11@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; JAI MAA,\n&gt; \n&gt; Arudhra Darshan=\r\n, Lord SHIV as `Nataraja&#39; today did the Cosmic Dance, the ANAND TANDAV on f=\r\null moon day for his devotees, offer abhishek basma, kumkum, turmeric, bete=\r\nl leaves to Lord Shiv.
