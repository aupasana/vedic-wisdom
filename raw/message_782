Narasimha is one of the right persons capable of\n&gt; guiding you. If you are sincere, you&#39;ll be helped. although, i write\n&gt; much now a days, i am just like anybody else, struggeling !!!\n\nI am a beggar like others. But I try to help other beggars by showing the \nhouses where they can try their luck by begging.\n\nNormally, one beggar may view another beggar as a competitor and not like \ntoo many people to beg in the same area. However, this begging is different \nand there is no competition between different beggars. The owner of the \nhouse has enough to give to every beggar and does not mind giving to many \nbeggars at the same time if they are worthy.\n\nActually, if one beggar gets something, it will be so much that he/she can \nshare some of it with all around him/her. If you go with 100 other beggars \nand beg, you are better off. If any one of them is able to melt the heart of \nthe owner of the house, all the hundred will benefit from it to varying \ndegrees!\n\nWhen I tell people about external practices such as homam and internal \npractices such as surrender and detachment in actions, all I am really doing \nis to take fellow beggars in front of a house where a rich person lives. If \nthey are able to melt the heart of the owner of the house, their begging \nwill be fruitful. That is completely in *their* hands.\n\nI am only a beggar who can show a place where other beggars can beg and I am \nnot really &quot;capable&quot; of anything more. Please do not treat me in any other \nway.\n\nWhen Swami Brahmananda, the spiritual son of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, and \nThakur himself saw themselves as beggars in front of the Mother, mama kim \nkathaa (what is my story).\n\n*        *        *\n\nIn general, to those who are struggling with internal conflicts related to \nspiritual progress and getting frustrated, I have a few words. Rome is not \nbuilt in a day. Forget Rome, even a small protocol of Rome is not built in a \nday! Be patient.\n\nI have seen people change from inside out in a short span of time. There is \nno need to panic or give up hope.\n\n*        *        *\n\nBe patient. Read scriptures. Read the words of saints and yogis such as \nRamakrishna Paramahamsa, Ramana Maharshi, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, \nSankaracharya, Ramanujacharya, Madhvacharya, Sai Baba, Kabir, Jesus Christ, \nBuddha, Mahavira, Jnaneshwar etc. Try to understand what they are saying. \nTry to integrate some of it into your common sense, your way of thinking and \nyour life style. Realize that the goal of spiritual practices is inner \ntransformation. The archives of this yahoogroup also have some inspired \nwritings.\n\nNobody can change you. You yourself can do it. You CAN do it, if you really \nwant to. Introspect and go to the root of your problems. If you introspect \nand analyze each big problem, you will realize that ego is the root of it \nall. Whenever something in life seems fundamentally important, question why. \nI am not saying to leave it. Do what you normally do. But, atleast analyze \nwhy it is important and try to understand your inner motives. Scuh \nintrospection will eventually lighten the clouds of fear, expectation, \nattachment and pride that often color one&#39;s attitude.\n\nIntrospect on your attitude and motives and contemplate on the nature of \ngod. Meditate.\n\nIn this age, there is nothing like a total surrender to the Lord. Of course, \nsaying &quot;I surrender to you. So give me x or y&quot; is NOT total surrender. Total \nsurrender means you take whatever the Lord gives without questions and \nexpectations. If you can manage it, you are all set!\n\n*        *        *\n\nHomam or worship of deities in fire is a powerful practice taught by rishis. \nI know from experience that it burns blocking karmas and enables the inner \ntransformation. It is a very useful spiritual practice. I know people who \nmade (and are making) considerable spiritual progress through regular \npractice of homam. It is the most powerful method I know of and teaching it \nis one of my tasks for this life.\n\nDear Rajesh, try to make some time in your daily schedule and start doing \nMahaganapathi homam everyday. After a few months, you should switch to \nVishnu sahasra naama homam (I will put it up on my website by then). THAT \nshould help you find your way in your spiritual life and strike the right \nbalance between spiritual life and material life.\n\nThe purpose of material life on this earth is to perform actions to pay back \ndebts without incurring new debts, so that spiritual progress becomes \nsmoother. Without paying certain debts, spiritual life cannot become smooth. \nHowever, without some spiritual progress, actions in material life create \nnew debts. In the beginning, one needs to create a synergy between the two \nand use the actions in material life to promote spiritual life. For true \nspiritual progress, most people cannot and should not run away from material \nlife.\n\nVasishtha said in the very beginning of Yoga Vaasishtham that action and \nknowledge are two wings with which the bird of manifested Self flies and \nbecomes liberated. Action without correct knowledge creates pride, promote \nego and binds one further instead of liberating. Knowledge without action \ndoes not become complete because of the remaining debts and one is stuck. \nOne needs to have true knowledge and perform actions, to become free.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, December 18, 2008 3:29 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Regarding Brahamcharya\n\n\nDear Raju,\n\nHave patience !

Supressing desire cannot be termed as a brahmacharya..right?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The connection between&#39;Desire & Supression&#39; needs to be\nunderstood\n&gt; &gt; properly, once and for ever so as to understand Control &\n&gt; &gt; Annihilation/overcome/rising above\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Let us take a practical case of day to day life of a common\nperson.\n&gt; &gt; Take an Individual &#39;Z&#39; has a desire for copulation with his\nwife.\n&gt; He\n&gt; &gt; *Satisfies* his desire one day and becomes very satsfied with\nit.\n&gt; &gt; now THAT perticular desire seems to be gone. few days passes on\nand\n&gt; &gt; mr. Z finds that the same Desire has Risen again, he again\nsatsfies\n&gt; &gt; the same with the same action. these cycle keeps going on & on\nfor\n&gt; &gt; many years. Mr. Z feels like most in the world that this desire\nto\n&gt; &gt; have sexual relationship is &#39;Natural&#39;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now let&#39;s analysie the above case. Though mr.Z satsfies the want\nof\n&gt; &gt; copulation, it comes back again & again. it means that the\ndesire\n&gt; &gt; has never been satsfied even by giving it FOOD Again & again.\n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; Our spiritual giants equvivocally say that The Energy which is\nlost\n&gt; &gt; during copulation is the BEST Energy available in a person which\nif\n&gt; &gt; restrained, controlled and preserved, can easly become OJAS and\ncan\n&gt; &gt; help immensly in the path of Spiritual journey.\n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; consider that our Mr. Z some how got to read the above paragraph\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; started seriously thinking about it. He tells himself that he\nwould\n&gt; &gt; refrain from intercourse for 3 months. The earlier frequency was\n&gt; 2/3\n&gt; &gt; days, now he suddenly finds that desire has completely overtaken\n&gt; &gt; him. after 15 days, he finds that Desire has gone in to his\nevery\n&gt; &gt; pour and every thought and he gives up and succumbs to that\n&gt; gigantic\n&gt; &gt; force of Kaam Vaasana. This may be called suppression initially\n&gt; &gt; which failed the effort. The person again analyses what went\nwrong\n&gt; &gt; and again tries to do the same and again fails. he keeps on\ntrying\n&gt; &gt; and keeps on failing. during this battles, he is also exploring\nand\n&gt; &gt; gathering knowledge of experienced people and knowledge from\n&gt; &gt; spiritual books. he understands that if he needs to win the\nFinal\n&gt; &gt; WAR with this Very Formidable enemy, he needs to do lot of\nthings\n&gt; &gt; simultaneously and he then resorts to the help from many\nquarters.\n&gt; &gt; He starts taking cold water bath, starts reading spiritual\nbooks,\n&gt; &gt; stops reading film magazine, stops watching Films and TV Shows,\n&gt; &gt; Reduces eating Onion and garlic, starts doing Yoga Aasan,\n&gt; Meditation\n&gt; &gt; and so on and so forth. taking the aids thus he keeps on\nbatteling\n&gt; &gt; with the *Natural Desire* and still keeps on loosing. but the\ngood\n&gt; &gt; news is that his days of batteling before loosing has increased.\n&gt; &gt; started from 10 days, he has now reached the struggeling\ncapacity\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; 90 days. (WE ARE ASSUMING HERE THAT HIS WIFE IS FULLY\nCOOPERATIVE\n&gt; OF\n&gt; &gt; HIS THEATRICS). He is still unhappy about his loosing, although\nhe\n&gt; &gt; is able to keep-up the Physical brahmacharya for 3 months. some\nhow\n&gt; &gt; he realises that God&#39;s grace is the most important thing\nespecially\n&gt; &gt; for this perticular matter and he now starts Praying to his\n&gt; &gt; favourite Deity every day. he cries and cries and requests the\nGod\n&gt; &gt; to save him from this loss. he keeps on trying every thing\n&gt; possible,\n&gt; &gt; keeps on praying sincerely and severly, keeps on doing various\n&gt; &gt; spiritual sadhanas but still keeps on loosing at as well. over a\n&gt; &gt; period of some 8/10 years, the desired change is visible. he has\n&gt; &gt; conquered his desire. Now Sexual Desire which was his *Natural*\nfor\n&gt; &gt; him has been replaced by Brahmacharya.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &#39;Supression&#39; when combined with Thoughtful Suspension, equipped\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; every possible preparation and will power to try untiringly\nagain &\n&gt; &gt; again finally results in to annihilation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. To control desire is also not brahmacharya?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If a person who has gained perfect self control but indulges in\nto\n&gt; &gt; the act of copulation only because to satisfy the desire of\nspouse\n&gt; &gt; or to have children, in my opinion, still maintains Brahmacharya.\n&gt; &gt; actually brahmacharya is a Nature, It can not be done but it\nDawns.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; in the same case, if the wife of Mr.Z is demanding then Z would\n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt; fight the one more big battle of either convincing Wife by\n&gt; &gt; explainging her, slowly moulding her nature and at the same time\n&gt; &gt; surrendering to the Lord. i mean praying lord to change her\nwife&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; nature so that she also starts thinking in the same line. as\nNalini\n&gt; &gt; Bahen has said, accepting everything as Mother&#39;s wishes.\n&gt; Brahmachrya\n&gt; &gt; or No Brahmacharya.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; friends, please forgive me. i think it was too much...but still\ni\n&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t write many things going across my mind.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; yours,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; utpal\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajesh rajgor\n&gt; &gt; &lt;rajesh_rajgor2003@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have read the contents of utpal.. that had raised few\nquestions\n&gt; &gt; in to my mind.. i would be happy if utpal can answer me..\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1.

Lord rama was also married and had kids..still\nhe\n&gt; &gt; was called Maryada purushottam...Lord Krishna has 8 patranis and\n&gt; &gt; 16000 gopia.. well does it mean that Lord krishna had physical\n&gt; &gt; relationship with all of them.. or he had not? that is all\ntogether\n&gt; &gt; different issue..But lord krishna was shringar priya� and� it\n&gt; &gt; seems that he had enjoyed physical realtionship.. (???)� still\nhe\n&gt; &gt; was called brahmachari.. how? i am bit confused..\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I personally feel that to have sexual desire and not\nfulfilling\n&gt; &gt; it,� cannot be termed as brahmacharya.. it is like cheating\n&gt; &gt; yourself.. and if you are married and if you donot fulfill\ndesire\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; your spouse is also not good.. Please advise.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rajesh\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 16/12/08, utpal pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: utpal pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Regarding Brahamcharya\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, 16 December, 2008, 2:12 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;             Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Let me put some thoughts and i&#39;ll continue writng as it keeps\non\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; occuring to me...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Thakur&#39;s marraige was never a marriage in physical sense\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) The author of &#39;Autobiography of a Yogi&#39;, Paramhamsa\nYogananda\n&gt; &gt; has\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mentioned in the same book that his parents lived like a\nHusband\n&gt; &\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wife only once a year to biget child.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) I&#39;ve read some where that our ancient Rishis though\nmarried,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lived extremely restarined married life and that too only to\n&gt; beget\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; children.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 4) Adi Shankaracharya, Swami Vivekananda and all monastic\n&gt; &gt; disciples\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of Thakur, Swami Sivanada, Gnaneshwar, SainBaba, Aurobindo,\nSri\n&gt; &gt; Sri\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ravishankar and countless known realised souls never married\n(We\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; assume that they maintained perfect brahmacharya) .\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 5) Many saints such as Tukaaram, Eknaath, Narasee Mehta,\n&gt; Jalaaram,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rishis of yore, Ekanaath, Mirabai, Jana Bai, and many other\n&gt; saints\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; were married. but i am confident that at some stage in their\nlife\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they would have ended, forever, the physical relationship with\n&gt; &gt; their\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spouses.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 6)complete Brahmachaya includes Physical & Mental. physical\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; brahmacharya includes Restrain of all the indriyaas and not\njust\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; procreative organs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There are many things looks contradictory in above but if one\nsee\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; deeper then there is a wonderful synergy. there is a common\n&gt; truth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what i&#39;ve started believing from the above written thoughts as\n&gt; &gt; well\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as many unwritten thoughts is that Brahmachrya is one of the\nmost\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; important vertue for realisation. but it seems that even\nmarried\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; people will also start maintaining that, knowingly or\nunknowingly\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; before final realisation. actually, it seems that Like\n&gt; &gt; realisation,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Brahmachrya aslo DAWNS !!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;rajarshi14&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;rajarshi14@ ...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Members\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was re reading this thread on the light of something I had\n&gt; &gt; come\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; across very recently. This is regarding Swami Brahmananda.

Thakur used to\nsay\n&gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was one of Sri Krishna&#39;s eternal playmates who had\nreincarnated\n&gt; &gt; on\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this plane.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; During his stay in various monastaries of the Ramakrishna\n&gt; &gt; Mission,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; often other monks used to send new initiates to Rakhal\nMaharaj\n&gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hios blessings. It was a generally accepted idea among the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; disciples\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of Thakur that any one who is blessed by Rakhal Maharaj will\n&gt; &gt; never\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; again be troubled by problems of lack of Brahmacharya.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One day an individual came to Rakhal Maharaj asking for his\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blessings and said &quot;Maharaj, please give me brahmacharya as\na\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blessing&quot;. Hearing this suddenly Rakhal Maharaj said, &quot;Why\ndo\n&gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people always come asking for Brahmacharya? Was does not any\n&gt; one\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; come to me asking me to give him/her God?

Several of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna&#39; s\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disciples also struggled with it initially and overcame\nlust\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blessings. Lust is a very basic human instinct and not at\nall\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; easy\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to kill\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; completely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the beginning, it is ok if the thought does not go out\nof\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind. Set a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rule for 20 days or 40 days or 108 days or some period\nlike\n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; maintain physical brahmacharya. Don&#39;t worry if thoughts\ncome.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Feeling of guilt is a weight and it does not help in\n&gt; &gt; overcoming\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the basic\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problem. Don&#39;t be over-burdened by it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, what i read in AGHORA was the important thing\nis\n&gt; &gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suppress desires but remove them from the root\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; True, suppressing desire will make the desire come back\n&gt; later.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But, if one\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; keeps fulfilling desires, they never end!!  This is the\n&gt; nature\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desire.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whether one desires money or knowledge (of anything other\n&gt; than\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Self) or\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physical pleasures, the desire will never end no matter\nhow\n&gt; &gt; much\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one gets.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Removing desire from the root often requires suppressing\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desire\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporarily. But the thing to remember from the Aghora\nbook\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that just\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suppressing desire is not sufficient. Practice suppressing\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desires, but do\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; remember that the final goal is to uproot it fully and\nkeep\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; working on it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The only reason for which i keep trying for brahamcharya\nis\n&gt; &gt; if\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vimalananda took such a long time probasbly i can also\ndo\n&gt; &gt; it ,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; if\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not in 6 years at least in 10-12 years\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That is the right spirit!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritual progress involves a lot of things and\nbrahmacharya\n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The most fundamental thing is to overcome ego and not\nbecome\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attached to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; things. Developing detachment to one&#39;s actions and\n&gt; possessions\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; developing a sense of surrender is the most fundamental\nthing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are several things in spiritual progress. They all\ncome\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; together! One\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person may develop detachment to actions and possessions\nand\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brahmacharya\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may become easy as a result. One person may achieve\n&gt; &gt; brahmacharya\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; detachment may become easy as a result and come later.\n&gt; Various\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; signs of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual progress come almost together, but the exact\norder\n&gt; &gt; can\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; change from\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person to person. Thus, do not be disappointed by your\n&gt; &gt; inability\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to get\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something.
