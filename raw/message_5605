Both are justified for differ=\r\nent reasons.\n\n \n\nBefore we answer this question, we need to understand who =\r\nis guru.\n\n \n\nAs I said earlier, guru literally means dispeller of darkness,=\r\n as per Guru Gita.\n\n \n\nHowever, there are different levels of darkness ever=\r\nywhere. When several lights are placed in a room, you may see several shado=\r\nws that are at varying levels of darkness.\n\n \n\nSimilarly, different concept=\r\ns of goodness in the field of duality exist (like lights in a room). Their =\r\nlack shows different kinds of darkness. A mathematics teacher throws one ki=\r\nnd of light from one angle and removes some level of darkness. A Sanskrit t=\r\neacher throws one kind of light from one angle and removes some level of da=\r\nrkness. A scholar teaching scriptures throws one kind of light and removes =\r\nsome level of darkness. But, none may remove darkness *completely*. Thus, m=\r\nost teachers are darkness reducers and not darkness dispellers.\n\n \n\nAs long=\r\n as the delusion of individualized self-awareness (aka &quot;egosense&quot; or ahamka=\r\nra or asmita) persists and, through it, one experiences dualities such as l=\r\nikes and dislikes, pleasures and pains etc, one is in *some* level of darkn=\r\ness! Only a self-realized and liberated person is free from darkness, as th=\r\ne light of Self is the only light that illuminates every point of the unive=\r\nrse, whereas beacons of light in the field of duality light up some parts o=\r\nf and keep some parts of dark. Any person who improves our understanding of=\r\n things through his teaching is *reducing* darkness, but not *dispelling* i=\r\nt completely. For this reason, most spiritual gurus of today are not really=\r\n gurus in the correct sense of the word. They are darkness reducers but not=\r\n darkness dispellers.\n\n \n\nAfter all, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa vehemently pro=\r\ntested whenever someone called him a guru and declared firmly that only Par=\r\nabrahma (supreme being) could be called a guru and nobody else was qualifie=\r\nd to be called a guru. This from a man who sent a highly rational being (yo=\r\nung Narendranath) into samadhi by merely touching him!\n\n \n\nIf one accepts R=\r\namakrishna&#39;s word, then Parabrahma is the only qualified guru. ParaBrahma i=\r\ns worshippable. So guru is worshippable!\n\n \n\nIf you accept someone as guru =\r\nknowing that he is a limited being, then you hope to reach ParaBrahma throu=\r\ngh that person. One approach is to start seeing that person as ParaBrahma (=\r\nthat is why we say &quot;gurur brahmaa gurur viShnuH gurur devo maheshwaraH&quot;). I=\r\nf you really see guru as ParaBrahma, then there is meaning in worshipping g=\r\nuru. But, if you do not and you merely see guru as a limited being and an i=\r\nnstrument in reaching ParaBrahma, then any worship is just a ritual and doe=\r\ns not mean much. So Swami Rama&#39;s words are not wrong.\n\n \n\nIn the end, wheth=\r\ner you worship guru or not is not the real thing that decides your progress=\r\n. After all, there are those who ban any idol worship, while there are thos=\r\ne who realize God through idols! Whatever practices you follow, the goal is=\r\n to read union with the divine. One may be worshipping guru with a still an=\r\nd firm mind that views guru as the epitome of divinity and one may progress=\r\n. One may be worshipping guru with a wavering mind that is fluctuating betw=\r\neen the polarities and confusions and one may not make progress. One may no=\r\nt be worshipping guru and yet one&#39;s mind may be still and firm and see divi=\r\nnity in all things, those that are worshipped and those that are looked dow=\r\nn upon, and one may make progress. I never emphasize specific actions or sp=\r\necific rituals, because that depends on the vaasanaas of the sadhaka.\n\n \n\nB=\r\nTW, communion with the divine is not an external pursuit, i.e. you do not g=\r\no somewhere or accumulate something or take some action to experience union=\r\n with the divine. Jagat or universe is the moving one (literally). ParaBrah=\r\nma is &quot;experienced&quot; when all movement ceases. All actions and rituals actua=\r\nlly involve movement of consciousness! Ironically, we use well-designed mov=\r\nements of consciousness to facilitate stillness of consciousness oneday. Th=\r\nis is the irony of spiritual sadhana!\n\n \n\nMy guru never asked me to worship=\r\n him. He in fact declared to me that he is incapable of doing anything and =\r\nDevi does whatever I may feel that he is doing. He only emphasized the need=\r\n to experience oneness with the divine and did not tell me to worship him.\n=\r\n\n \n\nBest regards,\n\nNarasimha\n\n---------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------\n\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writi=\r\nngs,\n\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n\n =\r\n                 http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n\n     Films that make a dif=\r\nference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/=\r\nJyotishWritings\n\n----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n\n\n \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@...&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Sri Narasimha garu,\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; 1.
