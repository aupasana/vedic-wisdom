A friend of mine tol=\r\nd me that sleeping at temples during nights is prohibited in Hindu samprada=\r\nyas and also only certain left handed practices mandate worship and pradaks=\r\nhina during midnight. He does not have any substantiation. Are these only l=\r\nocal practices or is there any text(s) that deal with this.\n\nI request scho=\r\nlarly friends to enlighten me on this/\n\nLove to all,\nRajmohan\n\n\n"}}
