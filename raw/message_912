It takes care of one&#39;s \nmaterial life and gives spiritual progress.\n\n(2) In my opinion, doing Mahaganapathi homam for a couple of years will be \nbeneficial.

PLUS Homam advice taking \ninto consideration AK\n\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimha-ji,\n&gt; May I ask two questions to you ?\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) Is it advisable to do any Homam (specifically MahaGanpathy homam)\n&gt; during solar eclipse time ? The annual solar eclipse, I believe, is on\n&gt; the 26th of Jan 2009, and would like to know if it is alright to\n&gt; perform this homam then. I understand the MahaGanapathy homam is\n&gt; specifically suitable as a remedy for people with Ketu dosha.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) I have an inexplainable affinity to the Sun God. I try to do a\n&gt; simple Agnihotra Homam - although not religiously.\n&gt; My apologies in advance for inter-mixing Astrology in this forum. My\n&gt; Atmakaraka Budh is in its Moolatrikona rasi conjoined with Rahu in the\n&gt; 12th house in Navamsa. Therefore, Leo is the sign which is 12th from\n&gt; AK&#39;s placement. There are no planents in Leo, but its lordSun is\n&gt; exalted in Mesha(but alongwith Moon and Saturn) in 7th house in my\n&gt; chart. So is Sun worship (Agnihotra Homam) advisable? Is a different\n&gt; Homam advisable given the planetary combination in my chart (and a bad\n&gt; phase wrt marital life that I am current going through) ??\n&gt;\n&gt; FYI - My DoB particulars are 27th May 1975, Hyderabad, 00:05 (5\n&gt; minutes after midnight). I have Gandanta Moola dosham/yoga.\n&gt; I am happy to donate a small sum towards education of poor children\n&gt; (instead of offering some money at a temple) in your name, for any\n&gt; help/advice that you offer me with my chart.\n&gt;\n&gt; Kind regards\n&gt; Sharad\n\n\n"}}
