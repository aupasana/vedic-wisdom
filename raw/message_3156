Narasimha,\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.=\r\nR. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Siva,\n&gt; \n&gt; My sincere apologies if I offe=\r\nnded you or offend you now.\n&gt; \n\nThanks for your sincerity. I am grateful fo=\r\nr you to be giving your sincere opinions on this topic. There is nothing fo=\r\nr me to get offended. My faith in Sri Sri is based on my personal experienc=\r\nes and feelings from my heart. Opinions of other sadhaks or scholars, howev=\r\ner experienced they are, are not my experiences and I neither feel elated n=\r\nor depressed based on their views. I ventured into this discussion as this =\r\nquestion was asked to me specifically and I felt I could clarify some aspec=\r\nts of it. \n\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Krishna ran away because Jarasandh s=\r\nhould not be killed by him and was \n&gt; destined to be killed by Bheema. But =\r\nplease note that it was *Jarasandh* who \n&gt; attacked.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the case of th=\r\ne debate in question, it was agreed to by *both* the sides, \n&gt; pre-planned =\r\nas a mega event, rules were laid out, it was advertized well and \n&gt; 50,000 =\r\npeople showed up! Many more must have watched it.\n\n...\n...\n...\n \n&gt; Yes, an =\r\navatar may choose to lose if it is necessary for a larger purpose in \n&gt; the=\r\n leela as you said, but I fail to see any &quot;larger purpose&quot; in this thing \n&gt;=\r\n yet.\n\nYou see a larger purpose in Sri Krishna&#39;s act because you have faith=\r\n in Him as a Purna Avatar. If you were a non believer in Sri Krishna, you c=\r\nould not have agreed to these arguments that justify Sri Krishnas&#39; act. Sim=\r\nilarly, a believer in Sri Sri may see a higher reason in this episode. He m=\r\night say that Sri Sri being a trikal gnani knew this had to happen and volu=\r\nntarily went through this with equanimity. You have to use the same yardsti=\r\nck in both sides of the argument. Faith free logic is not possible in Spiri=\r\ntuality...at least not till the end. At some point a leap has to be made, w=\r\nhich may be different from person to person.\n\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nIn hind sight, I realize that I should not have ventured to give an \n&gt; &gt; in=\r\ntellectual\n&gt; &gt; explanation for something that I myself have not yet intelle=\r\nctually \n&gt; &gt; understood.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for admitting that you yourself have n=\r\not yet intellectually \n&gt; understood it!\n&gt; \n\nIt has been my position that th=\r\nis incident cannot be intellectually understood.  \n\n&gt; Because of your *fait=\r\nh* that Sri Sri is a yogi in &quot;sahaja samadhi&quot;, you \n&gt; believe that there mu=\r\nst be some higher purpose served by this action of his. \n&gt; I respect your f=\r\naith. Faith not supported by logic and intellectual \n&gt; understanding cannot=\r\n be discussed further. \n\n&quot;A faith that is not blind is not a faith at all&quot;.=\r\n Didn&#39;t Sri Ramakrishna and Sri Aurobindo say this? (exact words may be dif=\r\nferent) If you are looking for a faith supported by logic / intellectual un=\r\nderstanding, then that &quot;faith&quot; could not be complete / integral faith, imho=\r\n.\n\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Bottomline is that we are discussing things i=\r\nntellectually when we use \n&gt; vaikhari (*tangible* words - written or spoken=\r\n) to communicate. We are not \n&gt; communicating here using para or pasyanti o=\r\nr madhyama modes. Of course, even \n&gt; in the debate, Sri Sri and Dr Naik see=\r\nmed to be using vaikhari only.\n&gt; \n\nHow do we know that? Dr. Naik was using =\r\nvaikhari as was evident from his body language. Sri Sri was totally compose=\r\nd throughout the meeting and afterwards, which is not possible for someone =\r\nnot established in equanimity. Para, pasyanti, madhyama will work only to t=\r\nhe extent of sincerity / receptivity of the listeners. I have several first=\r\n hand experiences of such instances with Sri Sri, where something he seemed=\r\n to have said very casually shook up my being, sometimes immediately or som=\r\netimes much later. I was/am a very logical person living in the mind.. it w=\r\nas/is not easy for me to have such experiences.\n\n&gt; Sometimes, you see some =\r\ngreat masters communicating at levels higher than \n&gt; vaikhari. There is som=\r\nething unsaid (para, pasyanti or madhyama) that lies \n&gt; behind the said wor=\r\nds (vaikhari) and gets into the mind of the listener and \n&gt; creates an inde=\r\nlible effect on the mind. Swami Vivekananda&#39;s historic 1893 \n&gt; speech at Ch=\r\nicago, for example, had a far more mesmerizing effect on the \n&gt; audience pr=\r\nesent there than you would expect those mere words to have. \n\nThe mechanism=\r\n differs from Master to Master. Vivekanda&#39;s speech and writings are powerfu=\r\nl. For Sri Sri, it is his presence. Few years ago in D.C, while Sri Sri was=\r\n giving a talk, a well built American suddenly came running towards hims me=\r\nnacingly shouting &quot;Anti Christ&quot; and some other abuses. As he hurled towards=\r\n him, Sri Sri just looked at him with total compassion and within a fractio=\r\nn of a second, that person fell at Sri Sri&#39;s feet sobbing. Now he is one of=\r\n the sadhaks of AOL. There are several several such instances where people =\r\nhave transformative effect just in his mere presence. He may not even look =\r\nat them or talk to them. It can arguably said that during a comparable time=\r\n period, Sri Sri has had mesmerizing effect on several times more people th=\r\nan Swami Vivekananda had. Several muslim terrorists, naxalites have embrace=\r\nd Art of Living. There are Art of Living teachers among Pakistani muslims a=\r\nnd Iraqis! Do you suppose it is possible with pure logical arguments?\n\n...\n=\r\n...\n...\n&gt; \n&gt; If master debaters like Swami Vivekananda or Aadi Shankara had=\r\n debated \n&gt; someone of the stature of Dr Naik, I can imagine what they woul=\r\nd have done.\n\nI disagree. Each Master&#39;s way is different. An englightened M=\r\naster that has come down for a Mission is not just a personality that react=\r\ns to situations in some pre-set way. They are manifestations of their missi=\r\non. There is such an integrity in their whole being that every act, breath,=\r\n word and body language will radiate one vibration which is the core of the=\r\nir mission. \n\nSwami Vivekananda came down to awaken India and her youth. Hi=\r\ns mission was to give the Shakthi to a comotose Hindu soul of that time. So=\r\n naturally his very being radiated a Force needed for that mission. \n\nSri S=\r\nri on the other hand has come down with a different mission - that of creat=\r\ning a one world family and reviving spiritual values in a manner that cuts =\r\nacross religions. His mission is to spread harmony, love, joy, and lightnes=\r\ns everywhere and unite people that way. His very personality is harmonious,=\r\n soft and his being radiates such an unconditional love. Whatever act he do=\r\nes, his very being will radiate harmony, love, joy and light. One needs to =\r\nbe in his presence for some time to realize this.\n\nIMHO, it is foolish to c=\r\nompare Masters for this very reason. Even though they both could have come =\r\nfrom the same source, Vivekananda is not Sri Sri and for him to do the work=\r\n of Sri Sri, he has to come down as another Sri Sri (personality wise)! Vic=\r\ne versa is true as well.\n\nBtw, that is one reason why Sri Krishna is called=\r\n Purna Avatar because he radiated with all possible vibrations to its full =\r\neffect in one life time!\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n\nLove,\n   Siva.\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
