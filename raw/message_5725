You may express i=\r\nt\nin one way and I in another, but it is for all. Creative happiness has no=\r\n\nvalue on the market; it is not a commodity to be sold to the highest bidde=\r\nr,\nbut it is the one thing that can be for all. (p.2)\n\nAfter all, to be ope=\r\nn to the source of all happiness is the highest\nreligion; but to realize th=\r\nis happiness, you must give right attention to\nit, as you do to business. T=\r\nhe teacher=E2=80=99s profession is not a mere routine\njob, but the expressi=\r\non of beauty and joy, which cannot be measured in terms\nof achievement and =\r\nsuccess.\n\nConflict exists when there is no integration between challenge an=\r\nd response.\nThis conflict is the result of our conditioning. Conditioning i=\r\ns attachment:\nattachment to work, to tradition, to property, to people, to =\r\nideas, and so\non. If there were no attachment, would there be conditioning?=\r\n Of course not.\nSo why are we attached? I am attached to my country because=\r\n through\nidentification with it I become somebody. I identify myself with m=\r\ny work,\nand the work becomes important. I am my family, my property; I am a=\r\nttached\nto them. The object of attachment offers me the means of escape fro=\r\nm my own\nemptiness. Attachment is escape, and it is escape that strengthens=\r\n\nconditioning. If I am attached to you, it is because you have become the\nm=\r\neans of escape from myself; therefore you are very important to me and I\nmu=\r\nst possess you, hold on to you. You become the conditioning factor, and\nesc=\r\nape is the conditioning. If we can be aware of our escapes, we can then\nper=\r\nceive the factors, the influences that make for conditioning. (p.5)\n\nThere =\r\nare escapes at all the levels of our being. You escape through work,\nanothe=\r\nr through drink, another through religious ceremonies, another through\nknow=\r\nledge, another through God, and still another is addicted to amusement.\nAll=\r\n escapes are the same, there is no superior or inferior escape. God and\ndri=\r\nnk are on the same level as long as they are escapes from what we are.\nWhen=\r\n we are aware of our escapes, only then can we know of our conditioning.\n(p=\r\n.5-6)\n\nTo cultivate detachment is another form of escape, of isolation; it =\r\nis\nattachment to an abstraction, to an ideal called detachment.\n\nThinking a=\r\nbout the problem is escape from the problem; for thinking is the\nproblem, a=\r\nnd the only problem. The mind, unwilling to be what it is, fearful\nof what =\r\nit is, seeks these various escapes, and the way of escape is\nthought. As lo=\r\nng as there is thinking, there must be escapes, attachments,\nwhich only str=\r\nengthen conditioning. (p.6-7)\n\nFreedom from conditioning comes with the fre=\r\nedom from thinking. When the\nmind is utterly still, only then is there free=\r\ndom for the real to be.\n\nLove is a strange thing; as long as thought is wov=\r\nen through it, it is not\nlove. When you think of someone you love, that per=\r\nson becomes the symbol of\npleasant sensations, memories, images; but that i=\r\ns not love. Thought is\nsensation, and sensation is not love. The very proce=\r\nss of thinking is the\ndenial of love. Love is the flame without the smoke o=\r\nf thought, of jealousy,\nof antagonism, of usage, which are things of the mi=\r\nnd.\n\nWe move from one substitution to another, but essentially, all substit=\r\nutions\nare the same, though verbally they may appear to be dissimilar. So y=\r\nou are\ncaught in the net of your own thought.\n\nRevolution based an idea, ho=\r\nwever logical and in accordance with historical\nevidence, cannot bring abou=\r\nt equality. The very function of idea is to\nseparate people. Belief, religi=\r\nous or political, sets man against man.\nSo-called\nreligions have divided pe=\r\nople, and still do. Organized belief, which is\ncalled religion, is, like an=\r\ny other ideology, a thing of the mind and\ntherefore separative. (p.16-17)\n\n=\r\nActually, there is inequality at all the levels of existence. One has\ncapac=\r\nity, and another has not; one leads, and another follows; one is dull,\nand =\r\nanother is sensitive, alert , adaptable; one paints or writes, and\nanother =\r\ndigs; one is a scientist, and another a sweeper. Inequality is a\nfact, and =\r\nno revolution can do away with it. (p.17)\n\nHow necessary it is for the mind=\r\n to purge itself of all thought, to be\nconstantly empty, not made empty, bu=\r\nt simply empty; to die to all thought,\nto all of yesterday=E2=80=99s memori=\r\nes, and to the coming hour! It is simple to die,\nand it is hard to continue=\r\n; for continuity is effort to be or not to be.\nEffort is desire, and desire=\r\n can die only when the mind ceases to acquire. How\nsimple it is just to liv=\r\ne! But it is not stagnation. There is great\nhappiness in not wanting, in no=\r\nt being something, in not going somewhere.\nWhen the mind purges itself of a=\r\nll thought, only then is there the silence\nof creation.\n\nYou have tried to =\r\ngain satisfaction from everything you have come in contact\nwith; and when y=\r\nou have thoroughly used it, naturally you get bored with it.\nEvery acquisit=\r\nion is a form of boredom, weariness. We want a change of toys;\nas soon as w=\r\ne lose interest in one, we turn to another, and there is always\na new toy t=\r\no turn to. We turn to something in order to acquire; there is\nacquisition i=\r\nn pleasure, in knowledge, in fame, in power, in efficiency, in\nhaving a fam=\r\nily, and so on. When there is nothing further to acquire in one\nreligion, i=\r\nn one saviour, we lose interest and turn to another. Some go to\nsleep in an=\r\n organization and never wake up, and those who do wake up put\nthemselves to=\r\n sleep again by joining another. This acquisitive movement is\ncalled expans=\r\nion of thought, progress!\n\nThe nature of the mind is to acquire, to absorb,=\r\n is it not? Or rather, the\npattern it has created for itself is one of gath=\r\nering in; and in that very\nactivity the mind is preparing its own weariness=\r\n, boredom. Interest,\ncuriosity, is the beginning of acquisition, which soon=\r\n becomes boredom; and\nthe urge to be free from boredom is another form of p=\r\nossession. So the mind\ngoes from boredom to interest to boredom again, till=\r\n it is utterly weary;\nand these successive waves of interest and weariness =\r\nare regarded as\nexistence. (p.22)\n\nTo find God, you try to subdue the mind.=\r\n But is calmness of mind a way to\nGod? Is calmness the coin which will open=\r\n the gates of heaven? You want to\nbuy your way to God, to truth, or what na=\r\nme you will. Can you buy the\neternal through virtue, through renunciation, =\r\nthrough mortification? We\nthink that if we do certain things, practise virt=\r\nue, pursue chastity,\nwithdraw from the world, we shall be able to measure t=\r\nhe measureless; so\nit=E2=80=99s just a bargain, isn=E2=80=99t it? Your =E2=\r\n=80=98virtue=E2=80=99 is a means to an end. (p.24)\n\nUnderstanding comes wit=\r\nh the ending of the thought-process, in the interval\nbetween two thoughts. =\r\nYou say the mind must be still, and yet you desire it\nto function. If we ca=\r\nn be simple in watchfulness, we shall understand; but\nour approach is so co=\r\nmplex that it prevents understanding. Surely we are not\nconcerned with disc=\r\nipline, control, suppression, resistance, but with the\nprocess and the endi=\r\nng of thought itself. What do we mean when we say that\nthe mind wanders? Si=\r\nmply that thought is everlastingly enticed from one\nattraction to another, =\r\nfrom one association to another, and is in constant\nagitation. Is it possib=\r\nle for thought to come to an end? (p.25-26)\n\nThe mind is not quiet when it =\r\nis disciplined, controlled and checked; such a\nmind is a dead mind, it is i=\r\nsolating itself through various forms of\nresistance, and so it inevitably c=\r\nreates misery for itself and for others.\n(p.31-32)\n\nOur acquisitions are a =\r\nmeans of covering up our own emptiness; our minds are\nlike hollow drums, be=\r\naten upon by every passing hand and making a lot of\nnoise. This is our life=\r\n, the conflict of never-satisfying escapes and\nmounting misery. It is stran=\r\nge how we are never alone, never strictly alone.\nWe are always with somethi=\r\nng, with a problem, with a book, with a person;\nand when we are alone, our =\r\nthoughts are with us. To be alone, naked, is\nessential. All escapes, all ga=\r\ntherings, all effort to be or not to be, must\ncease; and then only is there=\r\n the aloneness that can receive the alone, the\nmeasureless.\n\nIs devotion th=\r\ne worship of an image, of a person, of a symbol? Has reality\nany symbol? Ca=\r\nn a symbol ever represent truth? Is not the symbol static, and\ncan a static=\r\n thing ever represent that which is living? Is your picture you?\n\nLet us se=\r\ne what we mean by devotion. You spend several hours a day in what\nyou call =\r\nthe love, the contemplation of God. Is that devotion? The man who\ngives his=\r\n life to social betterment is devoted to his work; and the general,\nwhose j=\r\nob is to plan destruction, is also devoted to his work. Is that\ndevotion? I=\r\nf I may say so, you spend your time being intoxicated by the\nimage or idea =\r\nof God, and others do the same thing in a different way. Is\nthere a fundame=\r\nntal distinction between the two? Is it devotion that has an\nobject?\n\nThe w=\r\norshipper is the worshipped. To worship another is to worship oneself;\nthe =\r\nimages, the symbol, is a projection of oneself. After all, your idol,\nyour =\r\nbook, your prayer, is the reflection of your background; it is your\ncreatio=\r\nn, though it be made by another. You choose according to your\ngratification=\r\n; your choice is your prejudice. Your image is your intoxicant,\nand it is c=\r\narved out of your own memory; you are worshipping yourself\nthrough the imag=\r\ne created by your own thought. Your devotion is the love of\nyourself, it is=\r\n the reflection of your mind. Such devotion is a form of\nself-deception tha=\r\nt only leads to sorrow and to isolation, which is death.\n\nThe understanding=\r\n of =E2=80=98what is=E2=80=99 does not depend upon thought, for thought\nits=\r\nelf is an escape. To think about the problem is not to understand it. It\nis=\r\n only when the mind is silent that the truth of =E2=80=98what is=E2=80=99 u=\r\nnfolds.\n\nAwareness of the ways of desire is self-knowledge. Self-knowledge =\r\nis the\nbeginning of meditation. (p.66-67)\n\nEvery individual and group is af=\r\nter power: power for oneself, for the party,\nor the ideology. The party and=\r\n the ideology are an extension of oneself. The\nascetic seeks power through =\r\nabnegation, and so does the mother through her\nchild. There is the power of=\r\n efficiency with its ruthlessness, and the power\nof the machine in the hand=\r\ns of a few; there is the domination of one\nindividual by another, the explo=\r\nitation of the stupid by the clever, the\npower of money, the power of name =\r\nand word, and the power of mind over\nmatter. We all want some kind of power=\r\n, whether over ourselves or over\nothers. This urge to power brings a kind o=\r\nf happiness, a gratification that\nis not too transient. The power of renunc=\r\niation is as the power of wealth.\nIt is the craving for gratification, for =\r\nhappiness, that drives us to seek\npower. And how easily we are satisfied! T=\r\nhe ease of achieving some form of\nsatisfaction blinds us. All gratification=\r\n is blinding. (p.68)\n\nThe world is the projection of yourself. The world ca=\r\nnnot be transformed\ntill you are. Happiness is in transformation and not in=\r\n acquisition.\n\nOnly a happy man can bring about a new social order; but he =\r\nis not happy who\nis identified with an ideology or a belief, or who is lost=\r\n in any social or\nindividual activity. Happiness is not an end in itself. I=\r\nt comes with the\nunderstanding of =E2=80=98what is=E2=80=99. Only when the =\r\nmind is free from its own\nprojections can there be happiness. Happiness tha=\r\nt is bought is merely\ngratification; happiness through action, through powe=\r\nr, is only sensation;\nand as sensation soon withers, there is craving for m=\r\nore and more. As long\nas the more is a means to happiness, the end is alway=\r\ns dissatisfaction,\nconflict and misery. Happiness is not a remembrance; it =\r\nis that state which\ncomes into being with truth, ever new, never continuous=\r\n. (p.71)\n\nEven in complete isolation you are in contact with your thoughts,=\r\n with\nyourself. (p.75)\n\nSilence comes with the absence of desire. Desire is=\r\n swift, cunning and deep.\nRemembrance shuts off the sweep of silence, and a=\r\n mind that is caught in\nexperience cannot be silent. Time, the movement of =\r\nyesterday flowing into\nto-day and to-morrow, is not silence. With the cessa=\r\ntion of this movement\nthere is silence, and only then can that which is unn=\r\namable come into being.\n(p.77)\n\nStillness of the mind cannot be induced, it=\r\n cannot be brought about through\nany practice or discipline. If the mind is=\r\n made still, then whatever comes\ninto it is only a self-projection, the res=\r\nponse of memory. With the\nunderstanding of its conditioning, with the choic=\r\neless awareness of its own\nresponses as thought and feeling, tranquillity c=\r\nomes to the mind. This\nbreaking of the chain of karma is not a matter of ti=\r\nme; for through time,\nthe timeless is not. (p.80-81)\n\nTo understand the min=\r\nd is to be aware of desire and fear. (p.84)\n\nWithout understanding yourself=\r\n, whatever you do will inevitably bring about\nconfusion and sorrow.\n\nOnly b=\r\ny understanding the false as the false is there freedom from it. Be\npassive=\r\nly watchful of your habitual responses; simply be aware of them\nwithout res=\r\nistance; passively watch them as you would watch a child, without\nthe pleas=\r\nure or distance of identification. Passive watchfulness itself is\nfreedom f=\r\nrom defence, from closing the door. To be vulnerable is to live,\nand to wit=\r\nhdraw is to die.

The teacher=E2=80=99s profession is not a mere routine=\r\n job, but the expression of beauty and joy, which cannot be measured in ter=\r\nms of achievement and success.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Conflict exists when there is no in=\r\ntegration between challenge and response. This conflict is the result of ou=\r\nr conditioning.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Conditioning is attac=\r\nhment: attachment to work, to tradition, to property, to people, to ideas, =\r\nand so on. If there were no attachment, would there be conditioning? Of cou=\r\nrse not. So why are we attached? I am attached to my country because throug=\r\nh identification with it I become somebody. I identify myself with my work,=\r\n and the work becomes important. I am my family, my property; I am attached=\r\n to them.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0The object of attachment offers me the means of escap=\r\ne from my own emptiness. Attachment is escape, and it is escape that streng=\r\nthens conditioning. If I am attached to you, it is because you have become =\r\nthe means of escape from myself; therefore you are very important to me and=\r\n I must possess you, hold on to you. You become the conditioning factor, an=\r\nd escape is the conditioning. If we can be aware of our escapes, we can the=\r\nn perceive the factors, the influences that make for conditioning. (p.5)&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;There are escapes at all the levels=\r\n of our being. You escape through work, another through drink, another thro=\r\nugh religious ceremonies, another through knowledge, another through God, a=\r\nnd still another is addicted to amusement.

When the mind purges itself of all thought,=\r\n only then is there the silence of creation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D=\r\n&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;You have tried to gain satisfaction from everything you =\r\nhave come in contact with; and when you have thoroughly used it, naturally =\r\nyou get bored with it. Every acquisition is a form of boredom, weariness. W=\r\ne want a change of toys; as soon as we lose interest in one, we turn to ano=\r\nther, and there is always a new toy to turn to. We turn to something in ord=\r\ner to acquire; there is acquisition in pleasure, in knowledge, in fame, in =\r\npower, in efficiency, in having a family, and so on. When there is nothing =\r\nfurther to acquire in one religion, in one saviour, we lose interest and tu=\r\nrn to another.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0Some go to sleep in an organization and never wa=\r\nke up, and those who do wake up put themselves to sleep again by joining an=\r\nother. This acquisitive movement is called expansion of thought, progress!&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The nature of the mind is to acquire, to absorb, is it not? Or rat=\r\nher, the pattern it has created for itself is one of gathering in; and in t=\r\nhat very activity the mind is preparing its own weariness, boredom. Interes=\r\nt, curiosity, is the beginning of acquisition, which soon becomes boredom; =\r\nand the urge to be free from boredom is another form of possession. So the =\r\nmind goes from boredom to interest to boredom again, till it is utterly wea=\r\nry; and these successive waves of interest and weariness are regarded as ex=\r\nistence. (p.22)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;To find God, you =\r\ntry to subdue the mind. But is calmness of mind a way to God? Is calmness t=\r\nhe coin which will open the gates of heaven? You want to buy your way to Go=\r\nd, to truth, or what name you will. Can you buy the eternal through virtue,=\r\n through renunciation, through mortification? We think that if we do certai=\r\nn things, practise virtue, pursue chastity, withdraw from the world, we sha=\r\nll be able to measure the measureless; so it=E2=80=99s just a bargain, isn=\r\n=E2=80=99t it? Your =E2=80=98virtue=E2=80=99 is a means to an end. (p.24)&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Understanding comes with th=\r\ne ending of the thought-process, in the interval between two thoughts.&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;=C2=A0You say the mind must be still, and yet you desire it to function. =\r\nIf we can be simple in watchfulness, we shall understand; but our approach =\r\nis so complex that it prevents understanding. Surely we are not concerned w=\r\nith discipline, control, suppression, resistance, but with the process and =\r\nthe ending of thought itself. What do we mean when we say that the mind wan=\r\nders? Simply that thought is everlastingly enticed from one attraction to a=\r\nnother, from one association to another, and is in constant agitation. Is i=\r\nt possible for thought to come to an end? (p.25-26)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The mind is no=\r\nt quiet when it is disciplined, controlled and checked; such a mind is a de=\r\nad mind, it is isolating itself through various forms of resistance, and so=\r\n it inevitably creates misery for itself and for others. (p.31-32)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Our acquisitions are a means of covering =\r\nup our own emptiness; our minds are like hollow drums, beaten upon by every=\r\n passing hand and making a lot of noise. This is our life, the conflict of =\r\nnever-satisfying escapes and mounting misery. It is strange how we are neve=\r\nr alone, never strictly alone. We are always with something, with a problem=\r\n, with a book, with a person; and when we are alone, our thoughts are with =\r\nus. To be alone, naked, is essential.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0All escapes, all gatherin=\r\ngs, all effort to be or not to be, must cease; and then only is there the a=\r\nloneness that can receive the alone, the measureless.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Is devotion the worship of an image, of a person, of =\r\na symbol? Has reality any symbol? Can a symbol ever represent truth? Is not=\r\n the symbol static, and can a static thing ever represent that which is liv=\r\ning? Is your picture you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Let us see what we mean by devoti=\r\non. You spend several hours a day in what you call the love, the contemplat=\r\nion of God. Is that devotion? The man who gives his life to social betterme=\r\nnt is devoted to his work; and the general, whose job is to plan destructio=\r\nn, is also devoted to his work. Is that devotion? If I may say so, you spen=\r\nd your time being intoxicated by the image or idea of God, and others do th=\r\ne same thing in a different way. Is there a fundamental distinction between=\r\n the two? Is it devotion that has an object?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-w=\r\neight:bold&quot;&gt;The worshipper is the worshipped. To worship another is to wors=\r\nhip oneself; the images, the symbol, is a projection of oneself. After all,=\r\n your idol, your book, your prayer, is the reflection of your background; i=\r\nt is your creation, though it be made by another.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0You choose ac=\r\ncording to your gratification; your choice is your prejudice. Your image is=\r\n your intoxicant, and it is carved out of your own memory; you are worshipp=\r\ning yourself through the image created by your own thought. Your devotion i=\r\ns the love of yourself, it is the reflection of your mind. Such devotion is=\r\n a form of self-deception that only leads to sorrow and to isolation, which=\r\n is death.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The understanding of =\r\n=E2=80=98what is=E2=80=99 does not depend upon thought, for thought itself =\r\nis an escape. To think about the problem is not to understand it. It is onl=\r\ny when the mind is silent that the truth of =E2=80=98what is=E2=80=99 unfol=\r\nds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Awareness of the ways =\r\nof desire is self-knowledge. Self-knowledge is the beginning of meditation.=\r\n (p.66-67)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every individual and group is after power: power f=\r\nor oneself, for the party, or the ideology. The party and the ideology are =\r\nan extension of oneself. The ascetic seeks power through abnegation, and so=\r\n does the mother through her child. There is the power of efficiency with i=\r\nts ruthlessness, and the power of the machine in the hands of a few; there =\r\nis the domination of one individual by another, the exploitation of the stu=\r\npid by the clever, the power of money, the power of name and word, and the =\r\npower of mind over matter. We all want some kind of power, whether over our=\r\nselves or over others. This urge to power brings a kind of happiness, a gra=\r\ntification that is not too transient. The power of renunciation is as the p=\r\nower of wealth. It is the craving for gratification, for happiness, that dr=\r\nives us to seek power. And how easily we are satisfied! The ease of achievi=\r\nng some form of satisfaction blinds us. All gratification is blinding. (p.6=\r\n8)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The world is the projection of=\r\n yourself. The world cannot be transformed till you are. Happiness is in tr=\r\nansformation and not in acquisition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only a happy man can bri=\r\nng about a new social order; but he is not happy who is identified with an =\r\nideology or a belief, or who is lost in any social or individual activity. =\r\nHappiness is not an end in itself. It comes with the understanding of =E2=\r\n=80=98what is=E2=80=99. Only when the mind is free from its own projections=\r\n can there be happiness.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Happiness th=\r\nat is bought is merely gratification; happiness through action, through pow=\r\ner, is only sensation; and as sensation soon withers, there is craving for =\r\nmore and more. As long as the more is a means to happiness, the end is alwa=\r\nys dissatisfaction, conflict and misery. Happiness is not a remembrance; it=\r\n is that state which comes into being with truth, ever new, never continuou=\r\ns. (p.71)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Even in complete=\r\n isolation you are in contact with your thoughts, with yourself. (p.75)&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Silence comes with the absence =\r\nof desire.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0Desire is swift, cunning and deep. Remembrance shuts=\r\n off the sweep of silence, and a mind that is caught in experience cannot b=\r\ne silent. Time, the movement of yesterday flowing into to-day and to-morrow=\r\n, is not silence. With the cessation of this movement there is silence, and=\r\n only then can that which is unnamable come into being. (p.77)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Sti=\r\nllness of the mind cannot be induced, it cannot be brought about through an=\r\ny practice or discipline. If the mind is made still, then whatever comes in=\r\nto it is only a self-projection, the response of memory.=C2=A0&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;With the understanding of its conditioning, with the =\r\nchoiceless awareness of its own responses as thought and feeling, tranquill=\r\nity comes to the mind.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0This breaking of the chain of karma is n=\r\not a matter of time; for through time, the timeless is not. (p.80-81)&lt;br&gt;\n\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;To understand the mind is to be aware =\r\nof desire and fear. (p.84)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Without understanding yourself, wh=\r\natever you do will inevitably bring about confusion and sorrow.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n\nOnly by understanding the false as the false is there freedom from it. =\r\nBe passively watchful of your habitual responses; simply be aware of them w=\r\nithout resistance; passively watch them as you would watch a child, without=\r\n the pleasure or distance of identification.&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold=\r\n&quot;&gt;=C2=A0Passive watchfulness itself is freedom from defence, from closing t=\r\nhe door. To be vulnerable is to live, and to withdraw is to die.
