For those who don&#39;t have anything to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; chant, please =\r\nchant ram, waheguru, allah or any name, mentally. Recite\n&gt; &gt; &gt; any mantra, =\r\nanything, every waking moment should be devoted to god,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because its t=\r\nhe only worthwhile thing to do as a human.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks for the advice to chant till the cremation ground. Sound a=\r\ndvice no doubt.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Unfortunately Durga is partial to some of her chil=\r\ndren it seems, and not all of us are blessed with the intense desire to cha=\r\nnt as you seem to be. Stop rubbing it in please. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What is the use =\r\nof asking us to chant more? Ask her to give us this desire, as she seems to=\r\n have done for you. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Which brings me to ranting a bit about the ge=\r\nneral injustice of our esteemed Durga. The Atman is sexless, but the Atman =\r\nin female form has been treated worse than the Atman in male form over the =\r\ncenturies...even today it is being murdered in the womb (female foeticide),=\r\n raped, burnt in Sati etc etc. Yes yes it is deathless etc, but while in th=\r\nis ignorant state, it still suffers in the form of women. I hasten to add t=\r\nhat I am no feminist but right now, I&#39;m furious with Durga. How outrageous =\r\nthat for centuries, and even today, women were not allowed to be initiated =\r\ninto the Gayatri (which is to the Goddess). Why aren&#39;t there more women sai=\r\nnts? The ratio of female to male saints is probably 1:10. It&#39;s bloody dishe=\r\nartening. And what is the point of covering us with ignorance (it&#39;s her fau=\r\nlt, she is the Avidya Maya), and then yelling at us for not being wise (as =\r\nshe does in all the scriptures). If she wants to save us, she will have to =\r\ncreate in us the desire\n&gt; &gt;  to do japa or whatever. I wash my hands of the=\r\n whole thing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So don&#39;t tell us to chant, tell her to tell us to ch=\r\nant. Like she told you to. It&#39;s not our fault.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ok rant over. I&#39;m g=\r\noing to control my temper and do some Om Namo Narayanaya repetition now. Wh=\r\no knows when it&#39;s time for the cremation ground? You did it for a select fe=\r\nw, but not for the rest of us millions- Damn you Durga. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Aparna\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
