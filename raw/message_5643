If I was there, I would&#39;ve washed the feet=\r\n of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;this beggar and sprinkled the water on my head. This kind=\r\n of pure thinking is so &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;difficult to find now-a-days...&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Once when I was in Alandi, I heard two blind begga=\r\nrs talk inside the temple &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;presmises. One of them said that he=\r\n has recently been initiated by someone into &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;the Varkari path=\r\n and he can now sing Abhags (spiritual songs in Marathi) in the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt;company of other initiates. He was very happy. The other beggar asked hi=\r\nm, why &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;don&#39;t you sing the abhangs when you beg. You will get =\r\nmore money, your singing &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;is terrific. The first man replied t=\r\nhat he cannot use songs of God for earning &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;money, even if the=\r\n money is coming through begging. God is beyond everything &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;el=\r\nse. Begging is for my dharma, but signing is for God. I will not mix the tw=\r\no.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;When I heard it (&lt;deleted&gt; was also =\r\nthere) I was stunned. This coming from a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;begger! This created=\r\n a strong impact on my mind.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Such is the powe=\r\nr of Gyaneshwar Maharaj who moulds the consciousness of all &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;w=\r\nho go there.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; BTW, Krishna temple at Alandi, w=\r\nhere Gyaneshwar Maharaj is believed to be still &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;meditating in=\r\n the underground chamber (I have no doubt about it), is one of the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt;most spiritually charged places I have been to. Tiruvannamalai, Girna=\r\nr, Mayapur &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;and Dakshineshwar are some other places that are a=\r\nlive with spiritual energy.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lesso=\r\nns, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for sho=\r\nrt Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;a target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;\n&gt; &gt;      Films that make a difference: &lt;a target=3D&quot;_bla=\r\nnk&quot; href=3D&quot;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;\n&gt; &gt;      Spirituality: &lt;a target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-=\r\nwisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Jyotish writings: &lt;a target=3D&quot;_bla=\r\nnk&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot;&gt;http://groups.ya=\r\nhoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;=\r\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n\n&lt;meta http-equiv=3D&quot;x-dns-prefetch-control&quot; content=\r\n=3D&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-897552796-1295080995=:58928--\r\n\n"}}
