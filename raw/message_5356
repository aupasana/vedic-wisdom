Let me cl=\r\narify. (I am only dealing with the science part of these discussions, as I =\r\nhad already maintained right at the beginning).\n=C2=A0\n(3) I heard an inter=\r\nview with a scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) several months back. T=\r\nhey conducted an experiment on gorillas. One set of gorillas was fed with m=\r\neat. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After several months, res=\r\nearchers found a gap in the intelligence of the two sets. The ones fed with=\r\n meat were duller.\n\nIf=C2=A0you have any references for this, in terms of w=\r\nhether they published any paper on the same, I am interested to know and an=\r\nalyse that in details. I am open to learning and reviewing my position, pro=\r\nvided there is genuine evidence.\n=C2=A0\nTheir theory was that digestion of =\r\nmeat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed with nuts and fruits may have diver=\r\nted more energy towards the development of brain. Though they were not sure=\r\n if the same thing applies to human beings or not,=C2=A0=C2=A0a balanced ve=\r\ngetarian diet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellectual development.\n=C2=A0\nT=\r\nhis is a wrong theory as far as human nutrition=C2=A0is concerned, because =\r\nhuman stomach structure (gut morphology) is such that it finds certain anim=\r\nal products far easier to digest than most planet based products. In my oth=\r\ner mail, I have qoted from a couple of research papers and books on clinica=\r\nl nutrition and dietetics, and if you ask, I can provide more; which may=C2=\r\n=A0take a few days since I have to get them from people who deal with these=\r\n topics professionally, but time is not a problem.=C2=A0All the papers are=\r\n=C2=A0from the most accepted and reputed scientific=C2=A0journals. There is=\r\n no confusion. Which is why I said, it is myth that=C2=A0vegeterian=C2=A0fo=\r\nods are=C2=A0easier to digest, if digestibility is the criteria. \n=C2=A0\nFu=\r\nrther, in my experience, I never found traditional vegeterians to be any mo=\r\nre dull or smarter than traditional omnivores. \n=C2=A0\n(7) Regarding Priya&#39;=\r\ns question: Animals have their own vaasanas and their needs. If an animal c=\r\nan survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor fellow whatev=\r\ner he/she needs.\n=C2=A0\nAn animal has a specific physical=C2=A0structure an=\r\nd needs to maintain the same. But if trained they can &#39;adjust&#39; to any kind =\r\nof meals. I have seen people feeding vegeterian diets to dogs. Statisticall=\r\ny speaking, an animal whose whole body structure is designed to be a carniv=\r\nore, may adjust to any food for the sake of survival, but will become inter=\r\nnally weak and susceptable to disease and weaknesses. Who takes the karma f=\r\nor the disease and weakness that may result from an unnatural diet to an an=\r\nimal? \n=C2=A0\nNot that all dogs who are feed a veg diet end up being diseas=\r\ned, but the chances increase a lot. It is like not all smokers die of cance=\r\nr, but smoking makes one susceptible to cancer. It increases the probabilit=\r\ny. Therefore my personal opinion is that an animal if kept at home, it shou=\r\nld taken care of in the best way possible, providing it with whatever maybe=\r\n needed, including the right diet.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n_______________\n=C2=A0\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nA question for you.\n=C2=A0\nScientists studying evolution and human body=\r\n structures have concluded that meat eating along with cropping and fruits =\r\nhas been prevelant since at least 4 million years. That, without a diet whi=\r\nch was omnivorous, the structure of the human stomach (lack of a developed=\r\n=C2=A0caecum),=C2=A0and the threefold increase in=C2=A0brain size (from arc=\r\nheological evidences)=C2=A0could never have been what it is today. Which me=\r\nans, an omnivorous diet has been a=C2=A0natural process, so ingrained that =\r\nit has changed the very structure of the human body. This cannot be done co=\r\nnsciously, but only by the work of natural forces. (Again, if you want, I w=\r\nill provide relevent research=C2=A0papers to prove my claim).\n=C2=A0\nWhat i=\r\ns your take on this? \n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n=C2=A0\n&quot;Between me and=\r\n You, there is only me. \n\n\nTake away the me, so only You remain&quot; - Hallaj\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups=\r\n.com\nSent: Thu, 2 December, 2010 12:48:03 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Food w=\r\ne eat\n\n=C2=A0 \n\nNamaste friends,\n\nThere has been a lot of discussion on foo=\r\nd. A few quick comments.\n\n(1) We are we we eat. Production of various chemi=\r\ncals in our body and their interactions, are controlled by what we eat. Thu=\r\ns, what we eat has a profound impact on us.\n\n(2) Much has been written on t=\r\nhe material benefits from vegetarianism. But that is not all. There are spi=\r\nritual and subtle reasons as well.\n\nEating the flesh or body parts of an an=\r\nimal that strongly identifies with the physical body entails a karma. Self-=\r\nidentification of plants with their physical body is much subtler and the k=\r\narma entailed in eating plant-based foods is much smaller.\n\nEspecially thes=\r\ne days, very cruel methods are used for meat production by corporations and=\r\n animals are treated very cruelly. Part of the karma for their suffering go=\r\nes to the ones benefiting from their meat.\n\n(3) I heard an interview with a=\r\n scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) several months back. They conduct=\r\ned an experiment on gorillas. One set of gorillas was fed with meat. The ot=\r\nher set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After several months, researchers fo=\r\nund a gap in the intelligence of the two sets. The ones fed with meat were =\r\nduller.\n\nTheir theory was that digestion of meat takes up more energy. Gori=\r\nllas fed with nuts and fruits may have diverted more energy towards the dev=\r\nelopment of brain. Though they were not sure if the same thing applies to h=\r\numan beings or not, a balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s i=\r\nntellectual development.\n\n(4) After we eat a heavy meal, we may feel dull o=\r\nr sleepy and cannot focus well on work that requires alertness and skill. T=\r\nhat is because the digestive process is using up a lot of energy (also know=\r\nn as agni or fire) and there isn&#39;t much agni available for other activities=\r\n such as digestion of intellectual ideas that happens in the mind. Similarl=\r\ny, digestion of spiritual ideas/experiences also requires agni and that can=\r\nnot happen well. That is why meditation or homam after a heavy meal are fru=\r\nitless and we are normally advised to do sadhana before eating.\n\n(5) If foo=\r\nds that light up a higher digestive agni (e.g. meats, deep fried food with =\r\nmore oil, spicy foods that stimulate digestive agni etc) are consumed more =\r\nfrequently, agni is diverted towards digestion more often and there is less=\r\n agni available for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and exper=\r\niences. If one eats saattwik food that is very easy to digest (simple grain=\r\ns, simple lentils and simple vegetables, all softly cooked with mild spices=\r\n, and fruits), less agni is diverted towards digestion and more agni is ava=\r\nilable for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and experiences.\n\n=\r\n(6) Even a big fire cannot burn wet grass well. But huge stacks of dry gras=\r\ns may be burnt by just one spark! Similarly, little bit of internal fire ma=\r\ny be enough to assimilate spiritual ideas and experiences in a person with =\r\nexcellent vaasanas and few obstructions (dry grass). A lot of internal fire=\r\n may be needed in a person with poor vaasanas and many obstructions (wet gr=\r\nass). Thus, it all depends on vaasanas and impurities in nadis and chakras.=\r\n\n\nOne person may eat meat and deep fried foods, spend a lot of agni on dige=\r\nsting them and yet make excellent spiritual progress. Another person may ea=\r\nt saattwik food, maximize the agni available for spiritual transformation a=\r\nnd yet struggle to progress spiritually. However, the best course of action=\r\n for one is to ignore counter-examples and be a vegetarian. All other thing=\r\ns being equal, that maximizes the agni available for spiritual progress.\n\n(=\r\n7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Animals have their own vaasanas and their ne=\r\neds. If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the=\r\n poor fellow whatever he/she needs.\n\n(8) One should eat to live and not liv=\r\ne to eat. A yogi should consume enough food to sustain oneself so that one =\r\ncan fulfil one&#39;s dharma in the material world using physical body and make =\r\nspiritual progress. Eating too much food is not good for spiritual sadhana.=\r\n\n\nInstead of overeating most of the time and fasting on specific days, it i=\r\ns better to eat limited amount always. Regular practices are more important=\r\n for transformation and success, than occasional practices.\n\n(9) By merely =\r\nthinking that god is the doer of all actions or considering food to be god&#39;=\r\ns prasad, one cannot escape the karma involved. It depends on how deeply in=\r\ngrained that thought is and how deeply one feels so. If one internally feel=\r\ns 100% that god is acting through one and whatever one is doing (e.g. eatin=\r\ng) is just god&#39;s prasad to one, then one is free.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Sof=\r\ntware, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manu=\r\nals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.vedicastrologer.org/\nFilm=\r\ns that make a difference: http://saraswatifilms.org/ \nSpirituality: http://=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/JyotishWritings\n--------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-2143876522-1291262950=:17452\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Priyaji&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;O=\r\nne of my friend is having Labrador dog,this he bought when dog&#39;s age was ju=\r\nst 3 months and it arrived in a flight from Kolkatta.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Being pakk=\r\na Swaminarayan parivar they feed this dog with 1000% pure veg food the day =\r\nit arrived at their home and I must say that this dog is very lovely though=\r\n personally I dont like dogs but I am very much attracted towards this dog =\r\ncalled Rockie.He is pakka vegie,eats chapatis,Rotla made from Bajras,Drink =\r\nmilk at night and morning-takes buttermilk in lunch.No meat no eggs till th=\r\nis date has been served to Rockie and recently this dog got the 1st price a=\r\nnd scored highest marks in a competetion held here.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Just for you=\r\nr info,His current age is 13 years.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Pranams&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Aksha Rud=\r\nra&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Thu, 12/2/10, Priya M &lt;I&gt;&lt;prm7782@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;=\r\n/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px s=\r\nolid; PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: Priya M &lt;prm7782@ya=\r\nhoo.com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Food we eat&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@=\r\nyahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Thursday, December 2, 2010, 3:56 AM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV i=\r\nd=3Dyiv296832118&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;DISPLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv=\r\n296832118ygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: arial, helvetica, sans=\r\n-serif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: arial, helvetica, sans=\r\n-serif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: arial, helvetica, sans=\r\n-serif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste ,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I thi=\r\nnk the part about not&nbsp;feeding animals meat&nbsp;Narsimha garu has ment=\r\nioned in a spiritual point.

If an animal=\r\n can survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor fellow what=\r\never he/she needs.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D3&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D3&gt;An animal has a specific physical&nbsp;struc=\r\nture and needs to maintain the same. But if trained they can &#39;adjust&#39; to an=\r\ny kind of meals. I have seen people feeding vegeterian diets to dogs. Stati=\r\nstically speaking, an animal whose whole body structure is designed to be a=\r\n carnivore, may adjust to any food for the sake of survival, but will becom=\r\ne internally weak and susceptable to disease and weaknesses. Who takes the =\r\nkarma for the disease and weakness that may result from an unnatural diet t=\r\no an animal? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D3&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FO=\r\nNT size=3D3&gt;Not that all dogs who are feed a veg diet end up being diseased=\r\n, but the chances increase a lot. It is like not all smokers die of cancer,=\r\n but smoking makes one susceptible to cancer. It increases the probability.=\r\n Therefore my personal opinion is that an animal if kept at home, it should=\r\n taken care of in the best way possible, providing it with whatever maybe n=\r\needed, including the right diet.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D3&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D3&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D3&gt;____=\r\n___________&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D3&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT=\r\n size=3D3&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D3&gt;A question for you.&lt;/FONT=\r\n&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D3&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D3&gt;Scienti=\r\nsts studying evolution and human body structures have concluded that meat e=\r\nating along with cropping and fruits has been prevelant since at least 4 mi=\r\nllion years.

Which means, an omnivorous diet has been a&nbsp=\r\n;natural process, so ingrained that it has changed the very structure of th=\r\ne human body.

A few quick comments.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(1) We are we we eat.=\r\n Production of various chemicals in our body and their interactions, are co=\r\nntrolled by what we eat. Thus, what we eat has a profound impact on us.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;(2) Much has been written on the material benefits from vegetarianism. =\r\nBut that is not all. There are spiritual and subtle reasons as well.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Eating the flesh or body parts of an animal that strongly identifies with =\r\nthe physical body entails a karma. Self-identification of plants with their=\r\n physical body is much subtler and the karma entailed in eating plant-based=\r\n foods is much smaller.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Especially these days, very cruel methods ar=\r\ne used for meat production by corporations and animals are treated very cru=\r\nelly. Part of the karma for their suffering goes to the ones benefiting fro=\r\nm their meat.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(3) I heard an interview with a scientist on NPR (Nati=\r\nonal Public Radio)\n several months back. They conducted an experiment on go=\r\nrillas. One set of gorillas was fed with meat. The other set was fed with n=\r\nuts, fruits etc. After several months, researchers found a gap in the intel=\r\nligence of the two sets. The ones fed with meat were duller.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Their t=\r\nheory was that digestion of meat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed with nu=\r\nts and fruits may have diverted more energy towards the development of brai=\r\nn. Though they were not sure if the same thing applies to human beings or n=\r\not, a balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellectual deve=\r\nlopment.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(4) After we eat a heavy meal, we may feel dull or sleepy a=\r\nnd cannot focus well on work that requires alertness and skill. That is bec=\r\nause the digestive process is using up a lot of energy (also known as agni =\r\nor fire) and there isn&#39;t much agni available for other activities such as d=\r\nigestion of intellectual ideas that happens in the mind. Similarly, digesti=\r\non of\n spiritual ideas/experiences also requires agni and that cannot happe=\r\nn well. That is why meditation or homam after a heavy meal are fruitless an=\r\nd we are normally advised to do sadhana before eating.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(5) If foods =\r\nthat light up a higher digestive agni (e.g. meats, deep fried food with mor=\r\ne oil, spicy foods that stimulate digestive agni etc) are consumed more fre=\r\nquently, agni is diverted towards digestion more often and there is less ag=\r\nni available for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and experien=\r\nces. If one eats saattwik food that is very easy to digest (simple grains, =\r\nsimple lentils and simple vegetables, all softly cooked with mild spices, a=\r\nnd fruits), less agni is diverted towards digestion and more agni is availa=\r\nble for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and experiences.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;(6) Even a big fire cannot burn wet grass well. But huge stacks of dry g=\r\nrass may be burnt by just one spark! Similarly, little bit of internal\n fir=\r\ne may be enough to assimilate spiritual ideas and experiences in a person w=\r\nith excellent vaasanas and few obstructions (dry grass). A lot of internal =\r\nfire may be needed in a person with poor vaasanas and many obstructions (we=\r\nt grass). Thus, it all depends on vaasanas and impurities in nadis and chak=\r\nras.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One person may eat meat and deep fried foods, spend a lot of ag=\r\nni on digesting them and yet make excellent spiritual progress. Another per=\r\nson may eat saattwik food, maximize the agni available for spiritual transf=\r\normation and yet struggle to progress spiritually. However, the best course=\r\n of action for one is to ignore counter-examples and be a vegetarian. All o=\r\nther things being equal, that maximizes the agni available for spiritual pr=\r\nogress.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Animals have their own vaasa=\r\nnas and their needs. If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Oth=\r\nerwise, feed the poor fellow whatever he/she needs.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(8)\n One should =\r\neat to live and not live to eat. A yogi should consume enough food to susta=\r\nin oneself so that one can fulfil one&#39;s dharma in the material world using =\r\nphysical body and make spiritual progress. Eating too much food is not good=\r\n for spiritual sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Instead of overeating most of the time and f=\r\nasting on specific days, it is better to eat limited amount always. Regular=\r\n practices are more important for transformation and success, than occasion=\r\nal practices.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(9) By merely thinking that god is the doer of all act=\r\nions or considering food to be god&#39;s prasad, one cannot escape the karma in=\r\nvolved. It depends on how deeply ingrained that thought is and how deeply o=\r\nne feels so. If one internally feels 100% that god is acting through one an=\r\nd whatever one is doing (e.g. eating) is just god&#39;s prasad to one, then one=\r\n is free.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;----------------------------=\r\n------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish Software,\n Free Jyotish Less=\r\nons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam a=\r\nnd Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&lt;BR&gt;Films that make a d=\r\nifference: http://saraswatifilms.org/ &lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;BR&gt;Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/=\r\nJyotishWritings&lt;BR&gt;--------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n      \r\n--0-2143876522-1291262950=:17452--\r\n\n"}}
