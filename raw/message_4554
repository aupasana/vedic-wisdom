I am of the opinion that if the priest does not =\r\nposses at least a little spiritual power, He can not invoke deity&#39;s presenc=\r\ne however expert and perfectionist he is in performing a ritual.\n\nYes, i ag=\r\nree with you that &quot;Results&quot; are given because Deity is pleased by the ritua=\r\nl and offerings BUT can a divine deity will even be present if invoked by a=\r\n person who is not capable?. Pleasing of deity is even far away.\n\nIt is wel=\r\nl known that Brahamana&#39;s of yore were following very stringent, disciplined=\r\n, Unselfish and God-oriented life. They everyday used to devote good amount=\r\n of time in their personal sadhanas. (I am talking about Majority of them. =\r\nevery Yuga has every yuga present as you correctly said). I think, because =\r\nof that highly evolved life style and off course equipped with expertise of=\r\n performing various rituals, they were fit to become mediators between Yaja=\r\nmana and Devata. A real brahmana would therefore capable of invoking Devine=\r\n preence to the best of his ability and get the results for the Yajamana.\n\n=\r\nSo here i am sure you&#39;ll see point of &quot;caliber&quot; factor for person performin=\r\ng the ritual for &quot;Materialistic Desires&quot; of 3rd party (i.e. Yajamana).\n\n2) =\r\nYou have mis-understood &quot;Bagging bawl&quot; &quot;Beggars&quot; etc...

I will give my 2 cents of views based on my exper=\r\nience and\n&gt; insights. I will be honest, straight-forward and blunt.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; Like\n&gt; me and all others who respect Shri PVR Narsimhaji=\r\n as a noble, honest,\n&gt; intelligent, spiritual person and Sanskrit scholar m=\r\nust be feeling sad after\n&gt; reading contents in the post heading efficacy of=\r\n astro remedies. It=E2=80=99s really\n&gt; painful to read such thing from a pe=\r\nrson of his status whom lot of people\n&gt; considered as a good astro-spiritua=\r\nl personality. Though I am not having\n&gt; scripture references i=E2=80=99ll t=\r\nry to post my humble protest and request to all\n&gt; members to understand and=\r\n study shastra deeply for better understanding. \n&gt; \n&gt; Though believers call=\r\n priests and get poojas done, in the hope that their\n&gt; problems will be sol=\r\nved, many priests today are incapable of producing any\n&gt; results. As a resu=\r\nlt, some believers got accustomed to accepting that a pudding\n&gt; exists even=\r\n without eating it and remain hungry throughout life. And some\n&gt; intelligen=\r\nt people stopped believing in god and in remedies. Let me first address\n&gt; w=\r\nhy this has come to be and then talk about what we should do. \n&gt; \n&gt; Results=\r\n\n&gt; are produced rather bestowed upon the yajamana by presiding devata or de=\r\nity and\n&gt; blessings are called =E0=A4=95=E0=A5=83=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=BE [\n&gt; kru=\r\npA] Here we think results are produced; so let us understand the method. If=\r\n\n&gt; somebody wants good match for his unmarried daughter and ask some priest=\r\n to\n&gt; perform remedy and in turn pay some amount to brahmana or priest. Her=\r\ne the\n&gt; focal point is devata, a supreme authority for this ritual; as on y=\r\najamana=E2=80=99s\n&gt; behalf priest pray to devata to full feel yajamana=E2=\r\n=80=99s desire and in return get\n&gt; paid. So in this whole exercise priest i=\r\ns a mere mediator or a technician who\n&gt; can interact with both parties. And=\r\n interaction means correct rituals with\n&gt; appropriate mantras. So his spiri=\r\ntual or mental strength is not required but\n&gt; his skill and knowledge is of=\r\n prime importance. Can we consider a mortal priest\n&gt; to bless a yajamana? A=\r\nnd if a priest can bless yajamana what is the role of\n&gt; rituals, mantras? T=\r\nhe truth is; Blessings are bestowed upon the human beings by\n&gt; devatas as o=\r\nnly divinity is capable of this. And many times fruits are not\n&gt; received d=\r\nue to karmic blockages of yajamana. =E0=A4=95=E0=A4=B2=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=AF=E0=\r\n=A5=81=E0=A4=97=E0=A5=87\n&gt; =E0=A4=9A=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=\r\n=A4=97=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=A3=E0=A4=82 =E0=A4=AA=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8B=E0=\r\n=A4=95=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=82 [ in kaliyuga four\n&gt; times efforts are ne=\r\neded] and this is due to loss of anushtAna falA for doing\n&gt; bhushudhhI, sha=\r\nrIrashudhhI etc. And this is not an easy\n&gt; task on the part of astrologer t=\r\no fix the amount of prArabdha karma of\n&gt; yajamana.\n&gt; \n&gt; If one has one mill=\r\nion dollars in one&#39;s bank account, a check given by one\n&gt; for thousand doll=\r\nars is meaningful. If one&#39;s bank account is empty, what good\n&gt; is a thousan=\r\nd dollar check given by one? It will bounce. Similarly, poojas done\n&gt; and b=\r\nlessings given by a priest without enough spiritual energy cannot bring\n&gt; o=\r\nne any benefits.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; Yajamana get fruits of the rituals from t=\r\nhe inbuilt bank balance of deities\n&gt; and not of a priest. A powerhouse of d=\r\nivine energy, called devata can give\n&gt; million dollar check to unlimited no=\r\n of people as GOD has sanctioned rather\n&gt; appointed them for this work. In =\r\nRugveda tradition in vedic rituals in any\n&gt; pooja with or without homa in t=\r\nhe beginning there is one ritual called\n&gt; aAchAryavarana [=E0=A4=86=E0=A4=\r\n=9A=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=A3] means y=\r\najamana nominate a\n&gt; priest for whole ritual to please deity on his behalf =\r\nand in the end before\n&gt; visarjana of pooja [=E0=A4=B6=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=\r\n=A5=87=E0=A4=AF=E0=A5=8B=E0=A4=A6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A8] shreyodAn ritual is pe=\r\nrformed\n&gt; in which priest gives all shreyas i.e. punya generated in ritual =\r\nto yajamana.\n&gt; Here we can clearly understand the role of priest and the ro=\r\nle of deity. As per\n&gt; karmic law if you bless some body you lose your punya=\r\n and blessed one get that\n&gt; share of punya reducing your strength on all le=\r\nvels. Can a mortal though highly\n&gt; qualified priest blessed many yajamanas =\r\nas he interacts with many in his lifetime?\n&gt; This could be possible only fo=\r\nr highly evolved soul like saints and yogis as\n&gt; due to great penance they =\r\ndo have such powers. But even for them also some time\n&gt; loss of spiritual e=\r\nnergy leads for further penance. We read lot of stories in\n&gt; ancient mythol=\r\nogy of sages enticed by apsarAs [superhuman beautiful lady] or if\n&gt; they cu=\r\nrsed some body results in renewed penances to regain there status.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; One important note: The power is not in a combination of syllables=\r\n (mantra)\n&gt; or a sequence of physical actions (ritual). The power is in the=\r\n MIND that\n&gt; FOCUSES on a combination of syllables (mantra) or a sequence o=\r\nf physical\n&gt; actions (ritual). Energy is generated when mind overcomes its =\r\ntendency to\n&gt; wander and instead focuses on one thing. Different mantras an=\r\nd rituals as the focus\n&gt; points may generate different kinds of energy, but=\r\n the key is focus. Without\n&gt; it, no mantra or ritual produces anything. Foc=\r\nus comes with a lot of practice.\n&gt; Most priests are just engaging in casual=\r\n practice when they go and do poojas.\n&gt; In the old days, priests did intens=\r\ne sadhana and brought that energy to the\n&gt; table when they did rituals at t=\r\nhe houses of people or in temples.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; =E0=A4=85=E0=A4=A7=E0=\r\n=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=\r\n=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0 [ science of pathway to GOD] and\n&gt; =\r\n[science of full feeling desires through devata] i.e. =E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=87=E0=\r\n=A4=B5=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=\r\n=8D=E0=A4=B0 =C2=A0are two different things. This science of\n&gt; mantra and d=\r\nevata is not easy to understand. Divinity is beyond logic and human\n&gt; mind =\r\nis not capable to experience it easily. As per smruti =E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=82=E0=\r\n=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A7=E0=A5=80=E0=A4=A8=E0=A4=82 =E0=\r\n=A4=9A =E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=88=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=82 is a dictum. We are ha=\r\nving four types of\n&gt; vak [ vani]i.e. vaikharI, madhyamA, pashyantI and parA=\r\n [=E0=A4=B5=E0=A5=88=E0=A4=96=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=80,\n&gt; =E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=A7=E0=A5=\r\n=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=BE, =E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=B6=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=\r\n=82=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=80, =E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=BE] and last one is the mos=\r\nt subtle and\n&gt; imp. We see picture of bramhadeva sitting on a lotus which o=\r\nriginates from\n&gt; naval of Vishnu indicating creation origin of universe. Th=\r\nis is puran based\n&gt; concept of creation and vedic, tantra tradition are hav=\r\ning same concept with\n&gt; different terminology. The subtle seat of paravak i=\r\ns at naval and creator\n&gt; brahma creates this world with the help of saraswa=\r\nti and sarsawati is nothing\n&gt; but 52 syllable; =E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=\r\n=E0=A4=A3=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B2=E0=A4=BE. Saraswati is embodiment of s=\r\nyllables. When two unknown person meets first\n&gt; time how they get connected=\r\n? Through communication and thought is a form of\n&gt; vak, pashyanti. First th=\r\nere is desire to know each other and then communication\n&gt; starts. And in co=\r\nmmunication if some body express negativity communication\n&gt; stops. So for c=\r\nommunication soft speech, good words, etc are imp. So how can we\n&gt; assume t=\r\nhat mantra or rituals are of no importance? These show qualities, tools\n&gt; n=\r\necessary to get connected with devatas in right perspective. In scriptures\n=\r\n&gt; every syllable is assigned colour, form, etc. which denotes the nature of=\r\n that\n&gt; syllable resulting in typical energy. To be precise power rest with=\r\n desire and\n&gt; mind is a mere tool to channalise that power and strength of =\r\ndesire will decide\n&gt; depth of focused mind. So desire is from yajamana, min=\r\nd is of priest and\n&gt; blessings are from pleased devata. Even in great astro=\r\n treaty like BPHS, sage\n&gt; parAsharA recommended various rituals of various =\r\ndevatas for removing bad\n&gt; effects of bad dashas or bad planetary placement=\r\ns. I wonder if mantra and\n&gt; rituals do not count why Narsimhaji is having s=\r\no many homa manuals. \n&gt; \n&gt; To consider spiritual aspect of it, persons like=\r\n saint or yogis who do have\n&gt; dharanA like a solid rock who always rest in =\r\nTrans or dhyanavashtA need not\n&gt; require mantra or tantra, rituals for crea=\r\nting energy. A mere wish of them can\n&gt; do work. Normal people like me; requ=\r\nire all earlier six steps of ashtAngyOgA of\n&gt; patanjali like yama, niyama, =\r\naAsana, praNAyAm, pratyahAr and dharanA. And these\n&gt; all steps are embedded=\r\n in vedic or tantrik pooja traditions as mantra, tantra,\n&gt; nyas, etc. So fo=\r\nr wish to be get full filled by devata many many things count. =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0This whole confusion is due to\n&gt; Narsimhaji=E2=80=99s sin=\r\ncere wish to spread spirituality and he is doing this with pure\n&gt; heart. Ye=\r\ns, focus mind is one of the factors in this whole exercise. Many have\n&gt; see=\r\nn shatachandI or mahArudra anushathAna where many priest at a time read or\n=\r\n&gt; chant mantras with different level of mind focus still yajamana get fruit=\r\ns of\n&gt; it in terms of desires. This is because devata is pleased by offerin=\r\ngs, japa\n&gt; and hOme which in turn bless the yajamana with HIS blessings.=C2=\r\n=A0 For spirituality focus, pure heart and\n&gt; continuous efforts are of prim=\r\ne importance but for getting our desires to be\n&gt; fulfilled we need correct =\r\nprocedure, appropriate deity and correct mantra.\n&gt; Spirituality =E0=A4=85=\r\n=E0=A4=A7=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=B6=E0=\r\n=A4=BE=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0 is a love relationship =\r\nBTW jiva and parmAtmA =E0=A4=AD=E0=A4=95=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=80 =E0=A4=\r\n=B8=E0=A4=BE =E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=AA=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=\r\n=87=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=BE; where as =E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=\r\n=87=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=\r\n=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0 or mantrashAshtra is a give and take relationship =E0=A4=\r\n=AF=E0=A4=9C=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=9E=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=A8\n&gt; =E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=9C=E0=A5=\r\n=8D=E0=A4=9E=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=9C=E0=A4=A4. In love\n&gt; karma is not im=\r\np but in give and take it is the most imp factor. If someone is\n&gt; named rAm=\r\n and we call him as ramyA will he be pleased with you? Lord krUshna\n&gt; worsh=\r\niped for begetting child as santangopAla and same krUshana for bhakti are t=\r\notally\n&gt; different.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0It is a hype of old great priest=\r\ns which we\n&gt; constantly hear but there were millions of greedy, money minde=\r\nd priest all the\n&gt; time; its human nature. In every satyayuga we have kaliy=\r\nuga and that is why\n&gt; RAVANA a great dashgranthi brahmana ran away with sit=\r\nA. =C2=A0Narsimhaji freely distributing astrology\n&gt; software, lectures, hom=\r\nA manuals is a satyayuga in kaliyuga.

BTW, Sadhana of priest was and is a\n&gt; personal=\r\n advantage due to punyakarma [past birth=E2=80=99s good deeds] of yajamana.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0We must\n&gt; have gratitude for whole=C2=A0 past=\r\n\n&gt; generations =C2=A0for maintaining such a divine\n&gt; science in oral tradit=\r\nion for thousands of years with such a accuracy[ they\n&gt; know power of sylla=\r\nbles, so they maintained sanctity of akashrA, =E0=A4=85=E0=A4=95=E0=A5=8D=\r\n=E0=A4=B7=E0=A4=B0- =E0=A4=A8 =E0=A4=95=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B7=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=A4=\r\n=E0=A4=BF -\n&gt; non-perishable ] due to which we can proclaim ourselves as ve=\r\ndic\n&gt; astrologers, yoga gurus, vedic healers, vedic mathematicians etc. Yes=\r\n, we must\n&gt; mould / change according to [ =E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=B6, =E0=\r\n=A4=95=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B2, =E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=\r\n=A4=A5=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=80 ] surroundings, time and environments but=\r\n we must not let go real ethics,\n&gt; morals, rules of our ancient proved trad=\r\nitions. =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; Many people think that poojas to gods are a serious mat=\r\nter and only a\n&gt; trained priest should do them. The procedures have evolved=\r\n to become quite\n&gt; complicated over the time too! However, complexity of ri=\r\ntuals should never be a\n&gt; deterrent. Suppose rules dictate that you MUST ea=\r\nt 2000 calories everyday, 40 grams\n&gt; of protein, so many grams of vitamin A=\r\n etc. Suppose you have no access to such\n&gt; balanced food. Will you starve y=\r\nourself until you find a balanced meal or will\n&gt; you manage with whatever y=\r\nou have? If you just have a bowl of dal (lentil soup)\n&gt; and rice,\n&gt; \n&gt; you =\r\nwill simply eat it. You atleast get some energy. Similarly, if you do\n&gt; not=\r\n know the &quot;perfect way&quot; to do a mantra/ritual, you need not wait\n&gt; till you=\r\n know the perfect way. You can start with what you know. It will only\n&gt; giv=\r\ne you energy.\n&gt; \n&gt; The fear to do rituals without &quot;perfect knowledge&quot; stems=\r\n from the\n&gt; notion that some mantras/rituals can be dangerous. That notion =\r\nis not totally\n&gt; baseless, but it is irrelevant today. It is possible to fo=\r\ncus the mind on some\n&gt; mantras and rituals and get specific results. When u=\r\nsed by someone with a high\n&gt; level of spiritual energy, some mantras and ri=\r\ntuals may work very fast and give\n&gt; specific powerful results. However, Nat=\r\nure has purposely hidden (almost) such\n&gt; things in this age.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Yes vedic, tantrik rituals are complex and should be done by experts onl=\r\ny\n&gt; as these are for special purposes and should be done by trained people.=\r\n There\n&gt; are hundreds of ways for GOD realization and a single way to fulfi=\r\nll our\n&gt; desires. If you don=E2=80=99t know how to drive a car why opt for =\r\na fighter plane? =C2=A0=C2=A0Only if you elders, gurus have sanctioned it\n&gt;=\r\n then its ok. Nature has not purposely hidden anything but due to loss of e=\r\nnergy\n&gt; in doing bhushudhi, sharirashudhhi etc. for removing karmic blocks =\r\nwe feel we\n&gt; need more energy and we are not getting it. Yes, we should not=\r\n wait for perfect\n&gt; thing as perfection is subjective matter but we must re=\r\nad study, think, analyze\n&gt; before accepting any concept. I do fully agree w=\r\nith homA sadhana concept as\n&gt; this is one of the best ways for acceleration=\r\n according to my experiences in my\n&gt; twenties but it is for spirituality an=\r\nd for desires to get full filled through\n&gt; deities every thing counts.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; Different mantras and rituals are like begging bow=\r\nls of different shapes.\n&gt; They matter only so much. Depending on what kind =\r\nof a begging bowl you use, you\n&gt; may be given different kind of alms. But i=\r\nt is important to start begging with\n&gt; some begging bowl or the other, inst=\r\nead of spending years looking for the\n&gt; perfect begging bowl. Instead of wa=\r\niting for astrologers with half-baked or\n&gt; ill-conceived knowledge to tell =\r\nyou the perfect mantra or ritual, do what your\n&gt; heart tells you or what yo=\r\nur guru (or an elder you respect) tells you.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; WE, the jIvAs=\r\n are not beggars but anshA of GOD. =E0=A4=9C=E0=A5=80=E0=A4=B5=E0=A5=88=E0=\r\n=A4=B5 =E0=A4=AC=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=B9=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A8=E0=A4=83 . Hu=\r\nman being is the best creativity\n&gt; of HIM, the divine. The sole aim of manu=\r\nshyayOnI is to realize HIM. In this\n&gt; journey we may face many types of dif=\r\nferent obstacles due to our karma and to\n&gt; surpass them HE has given us pow=\r\ner and rights to use our intellect, mind for\n&gt; healthy, wealthy and peacefu=\r\nl life. And whole karma done for this in a pious\n&gt; manner is a sattvic karm=\r\na. Even for getting fulfilled our desires we do have a\n&gt; relationship of re=\r\nspect, love, gratitude with devatas. Beggars don=E2=80=99t have any\n&gt; feeli=\r\nngs for donors instead they even don=E2=80=99t remember them. We are =E0=A4=\r\n=85=E0=A4=AE=E0=A5=83=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF =E0=A4=AA=E0=A5=\r\n=81=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=BE; children of\n&gt; divinity. \n&gt; \n&gt; Yes,=\r\n unfortunately there are lot of fake astrologers, gurus etc. who are\n&gt; misg=\r\nuiding people;but again there is satyuga in kaliyuga. And for everybody,\n&gt; =\r\nkarma counts resulting in happenings of life.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0Mantra=\r\ns like Gayatri mantra, Shiva\n&gt; panchakshari mantra, Vishnu sahasranaama sto=\r\ntra, Ganapathi atharva seersha,\n&gt; Hanuman chalisa, Bheemarupi Hanuman stotr=\r\na, Vishnu&#39;s shadakshari/ashtakshari/dwadasakshari\n&gt; mantra, Venkateswara&#39;s =\r\nashtakshari/dwadasakshari mantra, hare krishna mantra,\n&gt; \n&gt; Chandipath (Dur=\r\nga saptashati), Durga saptashloki, Lalita sahasranaama\n&gt; stotra, Vyasa&#39;s na=\r\nvagraha stotra, Aditya Hridayam,\n&gt; \n&gt; Lakshmi ashtottarashatanaama stotra e=\r\ntc are *generic* and can work for\n&gt; anyone for any purpose.\n&gt; \n&gt; There\n&gt; ar=\r\ne many generic mantras (see my original mail at the bottom for a sample lis=\r\nt)\n&gt; that are appliable to everybody and can\n&gt; \n&gt; solve\n&gt; ALL problems. For=\r\n example, Vishnu sahasranaama stotra explicitly says it can\n&gt; solve ANY pro=\r\nblem. Instead of looking for a\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;perfect\n&gt; mantra recommendation&quot;, you =\r\ncan pick a generic mantra like that and start\n&gt; sadhana. The key is faith a=\r\nnd persistence.\n&gt; \n&gt; If\n&gt; your kaarmik blockage is the size of a rock, smal=\r\nl amount energy may be enough\n&gt; to move it away. If it is the size of a big=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; boulder\n&gt; on the other hand, much more energy may be needed.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; It\n&gt; seems Narsimhji is in too much hurry to spread concept of hom=\r\na in this world.\n&gt; Yes, as this concept is blessed by divine mother homa is=\r\n going to be popular\n&gt; sadhana in coming years. In his anxiety to spread th=\r\nis blessing he is\n&gt; contradicting his own words. Mantras do have vargabheda=\r\n and can be broadly\n&gt; categorized as=C2=A0 shrutimantra,\n&gt; smritimantra, pu=\r\nranmantrra and varadamantra. For ex. We can broadly classify savitur\n&gt; gaya=\r\ntri as shrutimantra; chandipatha as smrutinmantra; vishnusahastranam as\n&gt; p=\r\nuranmantra and shabarimantra[created by great navanath yogis] as varadamant=\r\nra.\n&gt; The term generic is itself illusive. Every devata, every mantra is as=\r\nsigned\n&gt; different power, different work by cosmic mother. It is HER wish f=\r\nor this\n&gt; classification. =E0=A4=89=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B8=E0=A4=95=E0=\r\n=A4=BE=E0=A4=A8=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=82 =E0=A4=95=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=\r\n=A4=AF=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A5=E0=A4=82( =E0=A4=95=E0=A4=BE=E0=\r\n=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A5=E0=A5=87 ) =E0=\r\n=A4=AC=E0=A4=B9=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=A3=E0=A5=8B\n&gt; =E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=81=E0=\r\n=A4=AA=E0=A4=95=E0=A4=B2=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=A8=E0=A4=BE [ For\n&gt; fulfil=\r\nling jiva=E2=80=99s desires and subsequent karma GOD manifest in different =\r\nform ]\n&gt; is the nucleus of all devatabheda and related different forms, man=\r\ntra, rituals\n&gt; etc. =C2=A0Why remedies are needed, how they\n&gt; can give desi=\r\nrable fruits, how can we achieve this and last but imp how this\n&gt; happen sh=\r\nould be focal point here. Remedies are needed to full fill desires, by\n&gt; re=\r\nmoving karmic blocks we can get this, by doing various correct procedures w=\r\ne\n&gt; can achieve this and this happens due to generated punya in this whole\n=\r\n&gt; exercise. For full filling desires we should know the depth of karma, to =\r\nremove\n&gt; karmic blocks we need appropriate devata, to achieve this we must =\r\nhave exact\n&gt; tools in the form of mantra, tantra, rituals etc; and at last =\r\ngeneration of\n&gt; punya in real timeframe. \n&gt; \n&gt; Let us have a quick look at =\r\nNarsimhji=E2=80=99s post on\n&gt; remedy for begetting a child. He has suggeste=\r\nd main remedy as santangopal\n&gt; \n&gt; mantra a well known proven remedy. Why he=\r\n suggested\n&gt; that? If every mantra from his generic list can do this he sho=\r\nuld have suggested\n&gt; any one. As per the shashtra the analogy should be lik=\r\ne this. Here we will\n&gt; sidetrack depth of karma as this is near impossible =\r\nto understand =E0=A4=97=E0=A4=B9=E0=A4=A8=E0=A5=8B =E0=A4=95=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=\r\n=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=97=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=80 [ gahanO karmagatI ], at least for =\r\nme. Consider a\n&gt; childless couple aged 35 years after ten yeas of marriage =\r\nwho desperately need\n&gt; a baby. Snatangopal is a specific form of Vishnu [ a=\r\n mahadeity responsible for\n&gt; sustenance of universe ] to bless childless wi=\r\nth a baby, the mantra itself is\n&gt; self explanatory as this aims at begettin=\r\ng child and the most imp it will\n&gt; generate punya in specific timeframe. Ye=\r\ns, every so called generic mantra is\n&gt; capable of giving everything to ever=\r\nybody but the main hurdle is timeframe. If\n&gt; we do any sadhana for long tim=\r\ne we accumulate punya; energy to have all\n&gt; pleasures in the world whereas =\r\nthe use of this punya depends upon the\n&gt; individual. In this case punya req=\r\nuired to beget a child is missing so we need\n&gt; that energy in real time fra=\r\nme as after 45/50 it is unlikely that lady will be\n&gt; capable of begetting a=\r\n child. Yes, all generic mantra will give child but in\n&gt; next birth as spec=\r\nific form of punya required to beget a baby will be\n&gt; accumulated after doi=\r\nng generic mantra for long time rather whole life time. As\n&gt; said in vishnu=\r\nsahasranama couple will get all fruits in next birth including\n&gt; baby and m=\r\najor part of that punya will be consumed for said cause of baby\n&gt; leaving s=\r\nmall part for other pleasures. If we use wooden hammer to fix a nail\n&gt; it m=\r\night take one hour to finish job but metal hammer can do this in five\n&gt; min=\r\nutes. This science, not logic is behind different mantra, rituals sanctione=\r\nd\n&gt; by sages for different purposes as karma is never generic.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Na=\r\nrsihmaji you are doing very noble karma in a\n&gt; sattvic manner so thousands =\r\nwill read you, hundreds will follow you; so for\n&gt; them and to our scientifi=\r\nc spiritual tradition i think you should do justice by\n&gt; rethinking on this=\r\n topic. I myself read your spiritual post with respect but in\n&gt; this matter=\r\n you miss the target. =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                Yours sin=\r\ncerely\n&gt; \n&gt;                    Satish\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
