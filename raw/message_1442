Even i am =\r\nthinking of doing Sudarshan kriya in front of Homa fire but it is not happe=\r\nning.\n\nMy question was rather academic and out of curiosity. i am not reall=\r\ny worried about air or fire or something else. actually i am not worried of=\r\n anything in life.\nI have done Sudarshan Kriya, PadmaSadhana, Hariom Pranaa=\r\nyam etc... Taught by AOL, and now doing Homam, i realized that when the wor=\r\nk of one tool is done, if one is sincere, one is automatically lead to the =\r\nnext tool for further progress.\n\nI am not aware of Kriya yoga as it is taug=\r\nht by society founded by ParamaHansa Yogananda. and actually now i don&#39;t de=\r\nsire to know that. I read many a books in last 4/5 years and now it seems t=\r\nhat they have done their job and hence i have no inclination to read any bo=\r\nok now. what i am interested now is the internal transformation and Sadhana=\r\n for that. not much interested in intellectual discussions also but some ti=\r\nme one get in to that.\nAll the knowledge of Mahavakya and Theory of Kundali=\r\nni Shakti etc.. are of no use unless it is experienced and that is what now=\r\n interests me.\n\nI think now i have found my Guru and Narasimha&#39;s instructio=\r\nns are the one on which i wish to settle down with all my faith but before =\r\nthat i need to clear every question that arises.\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nUtpal \n\n\n\n=\r\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;m540i98&quot; &lt;m540i98@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Na=\r\nmaste Utpal\n&gt; \n&gt; Good Question?\n&gt; \n&gt; Why compare Apple and an Orange. They =\r\nare two distinctly different items.\n&gt; Any path practised sincerely under th=\r\ne guidance of a siddha gurudev\n&gt; leads to end place, and once reaching ther=\r\ne everything is alike.\n&gt; \n&gt; What path one gets attracted to and make progre=\r\nss depends on the constituent sanskars that person has, accumulated over ma=\r\nny past lives.\n&gt; \n&gt; All paths are equal having their own pros and cons. \n&gt; =\r\nKriya Yoga is very effective in doing Nadi Shudi, the first step, along wit=\r\nh this one needs to practise Vaivhar Shuddi - good conduct.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not s=\r\nure about Sri Sri&#39;s sudarshan kriya, but babaji&#39;s kriya yoga had 10 or so d=\r\nifferent kriya, which were taught to the sadhak one after other as he made =\r\nprogress, these kriyas can be also termed as pranayams or yogic breathing t=\r\nechnics.\n&gt; \n&gt; But as one progress eventually the Kundalini Shakti rises and=\r\n it takes over and that is what is called the Raja Yoga in Bhagvat Geeta.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Once Kundalini Shakti starts rising and does chakra bhadan, the sadhaka=\r\n starts to do interesting meditation, yoga, mantra in spontanous way, i.e h=\r\ne is not the doer, he is just the observer to the play of shakti.\n&gt; \n&gt; This=\r\n leads to experiances that are not very easy to explain or describe.\n&gt; \n&gt; S=\r\nimilarly doing Homam also, the path is slightly different as with control a=\r\nnd concentration on fire, one regulates internal fire and that is also the =\r\nway.\n&gt; \n&gt; The main benefit of fire is the impact on environment, it cleans =\r\nup the environment. Also their a sloka, from fire, we have smoke and it cre=\r\nates clouds and clouds create rain and rain creats food, it supports the na=\r\ntural cycle.\n&gt; \n&gt; These days we see a lot of people proposing Homams is due=\r\n to the fact that we have severly polluted our environment, global warming,=\r\n water pollution etc. Homams help in cleaning up the environment.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why =\r\nworry about air and fire, practice what suits your mind or practise both. d=\r\no kriya yoga in morning and homan in evening.\n&gt; \n&gt; In my opionion an integr=\r\nated systematic approach of\n&gt; vyavhaar suddi, nadi suddhi, service or seva,=\r\n mantra yoga, other forms of yoga, bhajans and satsang is needed in these t=\r\nrying times to\n&gt; get focused. One needs to constantly focus on his chitta a=\r\nnd look at the impurties and try to clean them using one or more of above t=\r\nechniques.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards\n&gt; Mitesh\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Garu!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; One questioning thought which is stuck in my mind which i wish to put it =\r\nin front of you & list.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Agni is purer then Vayu - this comparision=\r\n statement is not very difficult to accept.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BUT i am thinking abou=\r\nt Yogis, who reached the truth by first holding on to the silk thread (brea=\r\nth) which is the only available external link which connects external and i=\r\nnternal world contineously.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; for example take a couple of cases suc=\r\nh as Babaji and his leanage. Sri Sri Ravishankar, Rishi Prabhakar and many =\r\nsuch known and unknown.\n&gt; &gt; these people (especially the first to names) ad=\r\nvocated &#39;Kriya Yoga&#39; in a very big way. Paramhamsa Yogananada in his celebr=\r\nated work &#39;The autobiography of a yogi&#39; categorically mention that Kriya Yo=\r\nga is like a Jet Flight to reach the truth in comparision to the other meth=\r\nods which are like bullock cart. he also mentions that Kriya yoga was first=\r\n taught by Krishna to Arjuna and then it was lost in time and was again rev=\r\nived by Mahaavatar Bababji and passed on to Lahir Mahashaya and the others.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; It is claimed that Sri sri Ravishankar went in to deep silence for som=\r\ne 8 days in the year 1980 and he came out with &#39;Sudarshan Kriya Yoga&#39; for t=\r\nhe world. he started teaching that and now it is practised regularly by mil=\r\nlions of people.\n&gt; &gt; I know from my abstract experiences that Kriya yoga of=\r\n Babaji and Sudarshan kriya yoga by Sri Sri are essentially same. why i say=\r\n that because one day i yearningly prayed babaji for helping me to learn Kr=\r\niya yoga and within a month i learnt Sudarshan kriya by AOL accidently.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n ***\n&gt; &gt; The point is that these people are advocating some or the other fo=\r\nrm of Kriya yoga, Raja Yoga, Hathyoga etc.. for all of these initial base i=\r\ns external medium which is Air (Vayu). I myself have done Sudarshan Kriya f=\r\nor some 2 years.\n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; Babaji or Sri Sri or any other master (present=\r\n day or ancient) have stressed on this medium. they actually didn&#39;t advocat=\r\ne Agni for the masses (Though as i said in prevous message that some have s=\r\ntarted advocating Homa of late). it is obvious that they may not be oblivio=\r\nus of the fact that Agni is more purer medium then air.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; I =\r\nWish to have your views on this whole subject.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; yours spiritually,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
