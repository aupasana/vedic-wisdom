But some things need to be taken care of  assuming the kundam is smal=\r\nl.\n\n   1)  carpet needs to be covered preferably with some near fireproof/o=\r\nr preferably fully fireproof sheets The covered area should be several time=\r\ns bigger compared to the size of the kundam. \nAdditionally the stone/cerami=\r\nc slab is a necessity\n   to prevent heating of the floor even though the ku=\r\nndam we get out\n  here (in US) is also raised.\n\n   2)  If dry coconut and G=\r\nhee is used as the main material the smoke is very minimal or not much noti=\r\nceable.. But a bit of it will be there when the fire is about to burn out w=\r\nith the last red glow..\nStart the fire with only 2/3 pieces of dry coconut =\r\n(about the size\n    of a quarter each. Materials like puffed rice,sesame se=\r\neds etc give very less smoke.. however some fruits and nuts do give some sm=\r\noke..depending on their type.but you could avoid putting\nin variety of mate=\r\nrials if you are doing it indoors.  \n\n 3) One need not memorize the sanskri=\r\nt invocations.. but can\nread it out from printed material. \n\n4) Narasimha&#39;s=\r\n Ganapathy Homam manual has got lot of info the practical aspects of it. Sp=\r\necifically see the Appendix D.\nhttp://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam/pdf/mah=\r\na_ganapati_homam_english.pdf\n\nAlso you can see the video he made here..see =\r\nthe raised platform,,covered area could be larger indoors..\nhttp://www.vedi=\r\ncastrologer.org/homam/ganapathi.htm\n\nHope it helps..\nRegards\nShashi\n--- In =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;davydv&quot; &lt;davyd@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Feel free to=A0ask questions about the practical details of sadhana.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Very well then.  My first and major concern is regarding the fire itself.=\r\n  I live in a small, one-room apartment.  I have a door I could open, but t=\r\nhe window I have is fairly overrun with vegetation.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a small por=\r\nch I could conceivably use, but it is open to the public, even though it is=\r\n opposite the main roadway.  None of my neighbors is, to my knowledge at le=\r\nast, Hindu.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Does the homam create a fair amount of smoke and/or odor=\r\n?  (I would of course disconnect my fire alarm, it goes off when I am cooki=\r\nng sometimes!)  Would it be best done indoors or out of doors, given my sit=\r\nuation?  I am thinking of buying some sort of stone or ceramic slab to put =\r\nthe kundam onto just to be safe in I do it indoors (rather than just the wo=\r\noden plank suggested in the instructions).\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, would I need to memor=\r\nize the Sanskrit invocations and the procedure, or would using a printed co=\r\npy of the instructions be acceptable?  I obviously would want to do the for=\r\nmer eventually, but is the latter ok when just starting out?\n&gt; \n&gt; Just a fe=\r\nw questions to start with.  As I said previously, it may be a while before =\r\nI am ready to perform the homam, but just thinking ahead and making prepara=\r\ntions!\n&gt; \n&gt; -- Davyd\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
