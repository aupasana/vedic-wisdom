This person was telling me about =\r\nthe 64 kalas. Not that I could\nunderstand everything that he was telling me=\r\n, but let me try and\nreproduce whatever I could understand.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; He show=\r\ned me an old diagram where there was one circle that was moving\nout from a =\r\ncentre like a whirlpool with three concentric arms. Each arm\nwas one layer =\r\nof the 64 kalas. Thus in total there were 64 such &quot;arts&quot;\nplaced at various =\r\nplaces on the circle. At the centre was atmavidya.\n&gt; He said these 64 repre=\r\nsent 64 different kinds of knowledge across the\nthree realms. A man when bo=\r\nrn in this phsyical plane, can at the maximum\nacquire mastery of ONLY 16 of=\r\n these Kalas. It is impossible to master\neven one more Kala staying in this=\r\n physical body. And ONLY Krishna had\nsuch a mastery.That is why=C2 he is pu=\r\nrna avatar.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Even Lord Rama was not a 16 kala purna purusha. To gain=\r\n mastery of one\nmore then 16 would mean leaving the physical body and going=\r\n into other\nsubtle realms.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; For an ordianry person, even mastery (by=\r\n mastery I mean perfected\nknowledge) of even a few (3/4) of these Kala is a=\r\nn exceptional feat.\nSuch a man is regarded as unique, genius, beyond words.=\r\n\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Now this 16/64 is theoritically=C2 the maximum knowledge of all\nas=\r\npects of=C2 the universe that a man can gain from his physical body.\nWhich =\r\nis roughly 1/4th.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; While talking about this, he was also trying to e=\r\nxplain to me how\nthese kalas interact with tattwas, or rather how and in wh=\r\nat degree\nshould each tattwa interact with a person in his system for him t=\r\no be\nable to gain mastery of any particular of these 64 kalas. Then he was\n=\r\ntalking mostlt about tattwas, and that by knowing the exact age at which\na=\r\n=C2  really spiritual person leaves his body, it can be ascertained\nwhether=\r\n he had use and access to tattwas beyond the 5 gross &quot;asudha\ntattwas&quot; of th=\r\nis physical plane of existence.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Anyway I know this may all sound ve=\r\nry jumbled up and incoherent, but\nthats entirely because of my own limitati=\r\non of understanding.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C2 Rajarshi\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; =C2\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; =C2\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;This above all: to thine own self be true!&quot; - Hamlet\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On =\r\nTue, 11/11/08, Ramakrishna ramakrishna_blr@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; From: Ramakrishna=\r\n ramakrishna_blr@...\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Power of Duality (Re: Sh=\r\nri Shri THAKUR is\nstill alive today)\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; D=\r\nate: Tuesday, 11 November, 2008, 11:33 PM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Narasimha=\r\n garu,\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Namaste.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt; When a being like Krishna is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; born w=\r\nith 16 kalas, He can do *anything* with the objects of the\ndual world.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n When a being like Sai Baba is born with 2 or 3 kalas, He can do a\nlot of\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; things in the dual world that are impossible for others.\n&gt;\n&gt; I heard Ka=\r\nlas in the context of moon (moon phases).

But, in the field of\nduality, we\n&gt; have differences due to previous v=\r\nasanas (conditioning) , which decide\nwhat\n&gt; and how much we can do within t=\r\nhe dual world.

I shall have to go\n=\r\nnow=C3=A2?=EF=BF=BD. -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And with my surprise his 8 years old=\r\n son came to call him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At one another incident he told me that th=\r\nere will be a plane\n&gt; &gt; &gt; crash\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tomorrow and that also happened. I =\r\nwas very much impressed about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He could foresee the event=\r\ns. One day I had to go to Dwarka by\nBus,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; told me not to go=\r\n through bus, as bus tire will be punctured.\nYet I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; went to Bus stat=\r\nion but bus did not come from Dwarka as was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; punctured\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the =\r\nway. This was surprising.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This all incidents made me to believe t=\r\nhat he had some super\n&gt; &gt; &gt; power\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and this was due to Ramkrishandev=\r\n worship only. I was attracted\nto\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One day I thought, I=\r\n should also be disciple of\nshri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thakur and the day came. It was 4/=\r\n4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered\n&gt; &gt; &gt; myself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to Thakur at Mr. Patel=\r\n=C3=A2?Ts house before Thakur picture. I\nprayed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deeply fr=\r\nom my heart to accept me as his follower and bestow his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; grace.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Next day morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10\nmorning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; while taking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wakin=\r\ng\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in the morning that I have\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife was annoyed\nand\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; argued with me a lot. =C3=A2?&quot;=C3=A2?oWhy should you take=\r\n such a\nhasty\n&gt; &gt; &gt; decision?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee o=\r\nf Maa Kali at Calcutta. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; great Saint but our Guru sho=\r\nuld be living one, who can guide us,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; give\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; us Mantra etc. etc.=\r\n Better you take Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Acharya\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since you =\r\nare doing Gayatri Mantra=C3=A2?=EF=BF=BD--.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Her arguments were ri=\r\nght at her place as people in general not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much about Tha=\r\nkur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I have\ntaken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hasty decision=\r\n. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But I remember that Mr.=\r\n Patel had told me that Thakur was\ntelling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their disciples to test =\r\nhim before accepting him. I also decided\nto\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test Thakur. I immediat=\r\nely told my wife that =C3=A2?&quot;=C3=A2?oSee,\nMr. Patel\n&gt; &gt; &gt; has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; neve=\r\nr come to our home. You have also not seen him. He has never\n&gt; &gt; &gt; asked\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me where I am living. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to our house\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nwithin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 10 to 15 minutes, would you believe that my selection for Th=\r\nakur\nis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perfect?=C3=A2?=EF=BF=BD--\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She laughed at me=C3=\r\n=A2?&quot;=C3=A2?oHow it is possible? I\ndon=C3=A2?Tt believe.=C3=A2?=EF=BF=BD-\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I prayed Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediately to just=\r\nify\nmy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decision and convince my wife. =C3=A2?~I want to test your\ne=\r\nxistence\n&gt; &gt; &gt; even\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; today.=C3=A2?T\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To our great surprise,=\r\n Mr. Patel was at my home at 06.30 in\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; morning with angry mood. =\r\nWhat he told?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=A2?~ How dare you test Thakur this way? Do you =\r\nknow what\nhappened?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yesterday was my night duty and I had just come=\r\n to my home at\n05.30\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mornings today and tried to sleep for 1 or 2 h=\r\nours. Suddenly\nThakur\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pulled my blanket and told me that-=C3=A2?o G=\r\no to your\nfriend=C3=A2?Ts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; house. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is waiting for you.

This person was telling me about the =\r\n64 kalas. Not that I could understand everything that he was telling me, bu=\r\nt let me try and reproduce whatever I could understand.&lt;br&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; He showed me an old diagram where there was one circle that was movi=\r\nng out from a centre like a whirlpool with three concentric arms. Each arm =\r\nwas one layer of the 64 kalas. Thus in total there were 64 such &quot;arts&quot; plac=\r\ned at various places on the circle. At the centre was atmavidya. &lt;br&gt;&gt; H=\r\ne said these 64 represent 64 different kinds of knowledge across the three =\r\nrealms. A man when born in this phsyical plane, can at the maximum acquire =\r\nmastery of ONLY 16 of these Kalas. It is impossible to master even one more=\r\n Kala staying in this physical body. And ONLY Krishna had such a mastery.Th=\r\nat is why=C2&nbsp;he is purna avatar.&lt;br&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Even Lord R=\r\nama was not a 16 kala purna purusha. To gain mastery of one more then 16 wo=\r\nuld mean leaving the physical body and going into other subtle realms. &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; For an ordianry person, even mastery (by mastery I m=\r\nean perfected knowledge) of even a few (3/4) of these Kala is an exceptiona=\r\nl feat. Such a man is regarded as unique, genius, beyond words.&lt;br&gt;&gt; =C2=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Now this 16/64 is theoritically=C2&nbsp;the maximum knowledg=\r\ne of all aspects of=C2&nbsp;the universe that a man can gain from his physi=\r\ncal body. Which is roughly 1/4th. &lt;br&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; While talking =\r\nabout this, he was also trying to explain to me how these kalas interact wi=\r\nth tattwas, or rather how and in what degree should each tattwa interact wi=\r\nth a person in his system for him to be able to gain mastery of any particu=\r\nlar of these 64 kalas. Then he was talking mostlt about tattwas, and that b=\r\ny knowing the exact age at which a=C2&nbsp; really spiritual person leaves =\r\nhis body, it can be ascertained whether he had use and access to tattwas be=\r\nyond the 5 gross &quot;asudha tattwas&quot; of this physical plane of existence. &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Anyway I know this may all sound very jumbled up and=\r\n incoherent, but thats entirely because of my own limitation of understandi=\r\nng. &lt;br&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; -Regards&lt;br&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n=C2&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; =C2=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;This above all: to thine own self be true!&quot; - Haml=\r\net&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; --- On Tue, 11/11/08, Ramakrishna ramakrishna_blr@... w=\r\nrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; From: Ramakrishna ramakrishna_blr@...&lt;br&gt;&gt; Subjec=\r\nt: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Power of Duality (Re: Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive=\r\n today)&lt;br&gt;&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;br&gt;&gt; Date: Tuesday, 11 =\r\nNovember, 2008, 11:33 PM&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Narasimha garu,&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Namaste.&lt;br&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; When a =\r\nbeing like Krishna is &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; born with 16 kalas, He can do *anyt=\r\nhing* with the objects of the dual world. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; When a being li=\r\nke Sai Baba is born with 2 or 3 kalas, He can do a lot of &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n things in the dual world that are impossible for others.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nI heard Kalas in the context of moon (moon phases).

One can understand unma=\r\nnifested non-dual &lt;br&gt;&gt; Brahman, but one cannot hope to understand the d=\r\nual world fully ever. She is &lt;br&gt;&gt; capable of deluding even the greatest=\r\n sadhaka with a wrong idea as soon as &lt;br&gt;&gt; one ventures into duality. S=\r\nhe can mislead *anyone* on *anything*. What She &lt;br&gt;&gt; does and why She d=\r\noes that is so difficult to fathom. The only way to deal &lt;br&gt;&gt; with Her =\r\nis to surrender to Her power *fully*.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; on the other ha=\r\nnd we are all a part of Divinity&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; BTW, though we are all pa=\r\nrt of the same Divinity, we are all not the same. &lt;br&gt;&gt; In the non-dual =\r\nfield, we are all the same. But, in the field of duality, we &lt;br&gt;&gt; have =\r\ndifferences due to previous vasanas (conditioning) , which decide what &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; and how much we can do within the dual world. When a being like Krishn=\r\na is &lt;br&gt;&gt; born with 16 kalas, He can do *anything* with the objects of =\r\nthe dual world. &lt;br&gt;&gt; When a being like Sai Baba is born with 2 or 3 kal=\r\nas, He can do a lot of &lt;br&gt;&gt; things in the dual world that are impossibl=\r\ne for others.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Realizing the non-dual Self is something tha=\r\nt is possible for anyone, but &lt;br&gt;&gt; there are limits imposed on what thi=\r\nngs one can do in the dual world, based &lt;br&gt;&gt; on the force of previous c=\r\nonditioning.

Thus, your basic &lt;br&gt;&gt; point hold=\r\ns. But I just wanted to point that all are not indeed the same. We &lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n should be disinterested in knowing who is what, not because all are the &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; same, but because we have no surefire way to know who is what.&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- =\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;br&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself=\r\n: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;br&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself=\r\n: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;br&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://gro=\r\nups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;br&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): htt=\r\np://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;br&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): =\r\nhttp://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;br&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website:=\r\n http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;br&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- - &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Dinesh Nambisan&quot; dinesh@nambisan. net&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; To: &lt;v=\r\nedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Sent: Monday, November 10, 2008 7=\r\n:54 PM&lt;br&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive =\r\ntoday&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; || Om Lokaah Samastaah Sukhino Bhavantuh ||&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; Does it matter at all who is whose reincarnation?

This is a=\r\nn unbelievable experience that I&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have had. I have no=\r\nt added anything from my own. I am writing&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; exactly&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; as was happened in my life. I am going back to the period =\r\nof&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1973/74.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kindly read this only =\r\nwhen you are in religious mood.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was working as telegraphist at Okha Port Post office =\r\nnear&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Dwarka.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My duty was from 7 am=\r\n to 7 pm and I was getting late fee allowance&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; for&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; extra duty. There was a Telephone exchange just opposite to=\r\n Post&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; office and due to same Dep=C3=A2?Tt; I had fri=\r\nendship with some&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Telephone&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; operat=\r\nors. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel)&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; was working as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of=C3=82 =C3=82=\r\n =C3=82 shri&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting h=\r\nim he was always talking&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; about&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shr=\r\ni Thakur. We came close day by day. There was a weekly&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ga=\r\nthering at&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his home called SATSANGA. He was singing =\r\ndevotional songs created&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; by&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him an=\r\nd was weeping while singing. He was reading Ramkrishna&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending this weekly&lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; meeting&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on Saturday evening. I was then 24 y=\r\nears old. Mr. Patel was of 30&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then. We were used to =\r\ngo to seashore daily at 7 pm after duty hours&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and we=\r\nre talking only about Thakur.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One day when we w=\r\nere at sea shore he suddenly told me--&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=A2?oRawalbhai,=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some guest have come to my home and my wife is reme=\r\nmbering me. My&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; son&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will come in a =\r\nfew minutes to call me. I shall have to go now=C3=A2?=EF=BF=BD. -&lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; -&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And with my surprise his 8 years old son =\r\ncame to call him.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At one another incident he to=\r\nld me that there will be a plane&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; crash&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; tomorrow and that also happened. I was very much impressed about&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; him.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He could foresee the events. One d=\r\nay I had to go to Dwarka by Bus,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; he&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; told me not to go through bus, as bus tire will be punctured. Yet I&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; went to Bus station but bus did not come from Dwarka as w=\r\nas&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; punctured&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the way. This was =\r\nsurprising.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This all incidents made me to belie=\r\nve that he had some super&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; power&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an=\r\nd this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was attracted to&lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also be disciple of s=\r\nhri&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 p=\r\nm I surrendered&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; myself&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to Thakur a=\r\nt Mr. Patel=C3=A2?Ts house before Thakur picture. I prayed&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; him&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deeply from my heart to accept me as his follo=\r\nwer and bestow his&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; grace.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nex=\r\nt day morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 morning&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; while taking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; waking&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up at 5.45 morning. I told to =\r\nmy wife in the morning that I have&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accepted Shri Ram=\r\nkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife was annoyed and&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; she&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; argued with me a lot. =C3=A2?&quot;=C3=A2?oWhy should you ta=\r\nke such a hasty&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; decision?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrish=\r\nna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta. He&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; w=\r\nas a&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; great Saint but our Guru should be living one, =\r\nwho can guide us,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; give&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; us Mantra e=\r\ntc. etc. Better you take Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Achary=\r\na&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since you are doing Gayatri Mantra=C3=A2?=EF=BF=BD=\r\n--.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Her arguments were right at her place as pe=\r\nople in general not&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; know&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much abou=\r\nt Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I have taken&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was te=\r\nlling&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their disciples to test him before accepting h=\r\nim. I also decided to&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test Thakur. I immediately tol=\r\nd my wife that =C3=A2?&quot;=C3=A2?oSee, Mr. Patel&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; has&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; never come to our home. You have also not seen him.

What he told?&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=A2?~ How dare you test Thakur this way? Do y=\r\nou know what happened?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yesterday was my night duty a=\r\nnd I had just come to my home at 05.30&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mornings toda=\r\ny and tried to sleep for 1 or 2 hours.
