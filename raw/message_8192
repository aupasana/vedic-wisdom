What???\nWhat exactly is the full f=\r\norm of life??\nAre you telling her to wear an ochre robe and sending her off=\r\n to some jungle when you want her to do a homam? fancy words these, the pat=\r\nh of spirituality and the likes..\nOr do you want that she ruins herself fir=\r\nst and then come to this path?\nShe can lead and experience a &quot;full form of =\r\nlife&quot; (in line with your definition), while doing a regular homam also. She=\r\n can enjoy her gucci, muchi and all the pradas of the world alongside the h=\r\nomam.\n\nI don&#39;t understand the apprehensions of the world with a homam, its =\r\nnot a ritual for destruction, its one of the most efficient, quick and inte=\r\nnse ways of worship available to us today and has been for millenia. Agni d=\r\nev is one of the most benevolent beings out there, till the time you don&#39;t =\r\noffend him ;)\n\nWhen your daughter , (if she is comfortable with it, don&#39;t f=\r\norce it), does a homam, she can very well lead a &quot;normal&quot; life Priya madam,=\r\n alongside doing a homam.\n\nDon&#39;t little kids go to temples?\nYour daughter i=\r\ns only inviting god in front of her in the fire and worshiping instead of g=\r\noing to the temple and what harm can worship bring????\n\nDon&#39;t be scared, if=\r\n you think she&#39;ll do fine, go ahead with it and supervise the entire thing.=\r\n The form of &#39;the one&#39; you invoke will take care, and hopefully take your d=\r\naughter under his/ her/ its wings!!\nRest of your concerns have been answere=\r\nd by Utpal.\n\nNow don&#39;t get offended by the above text and apologize.

Chinese Chop-stick is a very good option here. I myse=\r\nlf use it and find very comfortable. Let her manage the fire herself but yo=\r\nu can sit beside and intervene only if its needed.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think you need no=\r\nt worry about Brahmacharya. I am sure many of us are not able to maintain a=\r\nbsolute brahmacharya. let her start doing homam with some regularity withou=\r\nt having access baggage of &quot;Brahmacharya&quot; or such Dogmas at this tender age=\r\n.

Since she has =\r\nno experience she will need help so I was wondering can I take a metallic s=\r\npoon or something to help the fire from going out? Any tips how can I help?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Another question that arises in my mind is, is it too early =\r\nfor me to teach homam.  Homam requires one to be brahmachari. Due to hormon=\r\nal issues teens start experiencing sexual thoughts and varied emotions. Hav=\r\ning a kid control her emotions at such an early age is it really right on m=\r\ny part? Will I be putting pressure on them .....shouldn&#39;t they experience t=\r\nhe life in fullest form before endeavouring the path of spirituality.  \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Experienced parents kindly advice me? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Advance tha=\r\nnks for every help,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Priya\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
