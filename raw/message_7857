Lets look at few\nprobable scenarios:\n\n 1. *Scenario 1*: U helped cow to pay back its Rna. Possible that only way\nfor cow to get rid of it&#39;s past births Rna was to be eaten by you, someone\nwho revered it. Maybe, you helped it tremendously.\n\n2. *Scenario 2*: In some medical conditions, Ayurveda recommends meat\neating (Red meat). Perhaps, Nature/God/Deity wanted to help your body and\ncreated this situation as voluntarily you would never had eaten it. Then\ninstead of guilty, you should be thankful to it.\n\nThe hypothetical scenarios above show that happening is a happening and we\nshould neither have a guilt or should Gloat over it. Now, I will describe a\nreal scenario.\n\nI had a discussion with a *Guru* about food and if Saatvik food is best.\nHis viewpoint was that excess of Satva is not right. According to him, It\nshould be a balance between all three Gunas. Specifically about me, he\nmentioned a lack of Rajas. He infact suggested me to start eating Non-veg\n(Fish and Egg white). I could not implement his suggestion as I simply\ncan&#39;t. But, I wanted to share it to make a point that spirituality linked\nto Vegetarianism is a Limited way of thinking.\n\nRegards\nPuneet\n\nOn Sun, Feb 19, 2012 at 4:01 PM, Vasavi &lt;vasavi_rani@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Thanks everyone for advises.
