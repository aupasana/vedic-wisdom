The priest made a mistake=\r\n which made me realize that others may be making that mistake too!\n \nThat p=\r\nriest performed the homam with a small fire in a big rectangular aluminum t=\r\nray. Of course, I had my copper homa kundam with me and had just performed =\r\na homam before going there and my host too had a copper homa kundam with hi=\r\nm and either of us would&#39;ve been happy to bring the homa kundam and lend it=\r\n to the priest for the ritual. But the priest just performed in an alumimum=\r\n tray, which is not ideal. But that is not the mistake I am referring to.\n =\r\n\nHe offered a full dry coconut and some grains as poornaahuti. Though dry c=\r\noconut burns well if it catches fire, this gentleman dropped it away from t=\r\nhe fire and it did not catch fire. The grains also did not burn. The food h=\r\ne offered before poornaahuti was also too much for the fire and did not bur=\r\nn. Had the full coconut caught fire, there would have been a big fire and e=\r\nverything would have probably burnt. But it didn&#39;t and a lot was left unbur=\r\nnt.\n \nIt is in general not good if something offered in homa kundam does no=\r\nt burn, especially poornaahuti. Make sure that your poornaahuti burns. If y=\r\nou offer a dry coconut or a dry coconut half or a dry coconut piece in poor=\r\nnaahuti, make sure that it is in contact with fire (so that it catches fire=\r\n). If you offer a regular coconut (advisable only if you have a big homa ku=\r\nndam and a big fire), make sure you pour enough ghee on it so that it catch=\r\nes fire completely. In any case, the poornaahuti needs to be burn fully.\n \n=\r\nIf poornaahuti or some other offerings don&#39;t burn fully, it is fine to burn=\r\n it on the next day by performing homam in the same homa kundam. You can co=\r\nntinue doing homam daily without emptying the homa kundam of the ashes from=\r\n the previous day.\n \nBut, if you do a one-off homam like that priest, make =\r\nsure that your poornaahuti burns fully.\n \nWhen you are in front of a fire a=\r\nnd making an offering, some of your karmas are brought to the top of the &quot;p=\r\nile of karmas&quot; for burning. If you make the offering in fire properly with =\r\na decent mental focus, most of that karma burns and what is left for experi=\r\nencing is minimal. On the other hand, if you make an offering and it does n=\r\not burn, you brought out a karma to the top of the pile and it did not burn=\r\n. You now have to face it!\n \nIf you are one with a *perfect* sense of surre=\r\nnder who can take *anything* with an equal vision, all this is inapplicable=\r\n. But, if you are still trying to get there and doing homam to help you get=\r\n there, this is quite applicable.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n---------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourse=\r\nlf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.n=\r\net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jaga=\r\nnnath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n-------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------- \n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_020D_01C96A75.3A3E7760\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3492&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste=\r\n,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;F=\r\nONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;I happened to be at a Sudarsana homam performed b=\r\ny \na local priest at the house of some friends in North Carolina.
