Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n    =EF=BB=BF \n    Namaste,\n\n    There are really two different th=\r\nings here.\n\n    Some people are born with an amsa (part) of a rishi&#39;s consc=\r\niousness. For example, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said that Narendranath (Swam=\r\ni Vivekananda) was one of the seven great rishis. Many people did meet him.=\r\n Thus, meeting the physical manifestation of an amsa of a rishi is not that=\r\n difficult (though that also requires some punya).\n\n    The second thing is=\r\n to meet the physical manifestation of the entire consciousness of a rishi.=\r\n *That* is very very very difficult. As Vimalananda said, that may require =\r\na terrific amount of tapascharya (unless you are one of that rishi&#39;s people=\r\n who came to do some work on earth and have already done a terrific amount =\r\nof tapascharya in past lives).\n\n    *        *        *\n\n    One may wonder=\r\n: If rishis are so great, why do they not get moksha and why do they remain=\r\n in physical manifestation?\n\n    Though the following is essentially like a=\r\n kindergartener explaining Einstein&#39;s theory of general relativity to fello=\r\nw kindergarteners, I will nevertheless try to explain it.\n\n    All that our=\r\n senses perceive is Maya (delusion) that is created by the power of duality=\r\n. If the veil of delusion is removed, there is no duality and all is ONE un=\r\niform and undivided consciousness, known variously as Aatman or Brahman or =\r\nNarayana or Sadashiva. This one uniform and undivided consciousness is know=\r\nn as &quot;unmanifested Brahman&quot;. The world of duality, where there are many dif=\r\nferent objects, is also actually Brahman only, but Brahman that went throug=\r\nh some modification and manifestation. It is known as &quot;manifested Brahman&quot;.=\r\n Both are Brahman only.\n\n    Normally, living in the domain of duality with=\r\nout being deluded by some aspect of duality or the other is near to impossi=\r\nble. Remaining in duality with a perfect understanding of the underlying on=\r\neness of all objects and perceiving all those objects of duality without ex=\r\nperiencing attraction or repulsion for any single object of duality is almo=\r\nst impossible. Most spiritual aspirants try to reach the state of oneness w=\r\nith unmanifested Brahman - a state in which there is no duality and no obje=\r\nctification - and become absorbed in that state forever. That is the advait=\r\nic experience of &quot;nirvikalpa samadhi&quot; and what happens in &quot;moksha&quot;.\n\n    Ho=\r\nwever, maharshis have described higher states. It is possible to be in onen=\r\ness with manifested Brahman and unmanifested Brahman at the same time. It i=\r\ns possible to remain in duality, with the senses perceiving objects of dual=\r\nity, and yet remain in oneness with the underlying oneness (Brahman) of all=\r\n obejcts and not be deluded, i.e. not experience either attraction or repul=\r\nsion for any object of duality. Mere perception of objects by the senses is=\r\n not the problem. The tendency of mind to be find some attractive and find =\r\nsome repulsive is the problem. It is possible to remain in a state where th=\r\nere is neither attraction nor repulsion for any object is possible.\n\n    Su=\r\nch a state is experienced by very few beings. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Shir=\r\ndi Sai Baba etc were in this state always. Swami Vivekananda also experienc=\r\ned it.\n\n    Rishis are beings who are always in a very high state. They are=\r\n always alert to the maya and yet not stuck in it. They perceive objects of=\r\n duality and yet are not attracted or repelled by anything. If one overcome=\r\ns attraction and repulsion and yet remains in duality, one can pretty much =\r\ndo anything. But because one is neither attracted or repelled by anything, =\r\nit means one has no personal ego and one has no reason to do anything for p=\r\nersonal ego. Then one becomes an instrument of nature (Prakriti) and implem=\r\nents the wish of nature through one&#39;s actions, which are performed without =\r\nany attachment or personal identification. One who has a personal ego can d=\r\no limited things. One who has a very very small ego can do great things. On=\r\ne who has no ego can do ANY thing. But such a being does things that are de=\r\nsired by Nature - the natural order of the universe. They can change the co=\r\nurse of history of nations and planets.\n\n    A rishi in this state may enga=\r\nge in various actions of great consequence for the world. Yet, there is no =\r\nattachment with the actions. He is just an unattached instrument of Nature.=\r\n\n\n    If one gets out of the duality and becomes absorbed in unmanifested B=\r\nrahman forever, one is not born again. But a rishi who has an equal vision =\r\nof unmanifested and manifested Brahman is for ever mukta (liberated). Thus,=\r\n he will freely interact with duality without any fear or aversion. Amsa of=\r\n such a rishi may even be born again as a separate person, just as a proces=\r\ns running in a computer may spawn off a separate thread to do some focussed=\r\n task. Even if the computer process has finished all the initialization and=\r\n early work, the newly spawned thread has to go through initialization etc =\r\nagain. Similarly, the person born with amsa has to go through the process o=\r\nf overcoming weaknesses and realizing self all over again. When a Vivekanan=\r\nda is born from the amsa of a rishi, he may have to struggle initially and =\r\novercome the weaknesses and realize self all over again. But he is the amsa=\r\n of an ever free and liberated being and will find his way again.\n\n    Thus=\r\n, a liberated rishi, with the force of his liberated consciousness and with=\r\n the force of his reborn amsas, will act as an unattached instrument of Nat=\r\nure performing actions of tremendous consequences without any personal ego =\r\ndriving those actions.\n\n    *        *        *\n\n    Worshipping the rishi =\r\nof one&#39;s gotra and getting his blessings is a very good idea. In general, g=\r\netting the blessings of ANY rishi is a great idea. Pursuing the rishi of on=\r\ne&#39;s gotra is relatively easier for most people. But, if one has a connectio=\r\nn with a specific rishi (apart from the rishi of one&#39;s gotra), one can wors=\r\nhip that rishi. However, it is not easy to know that.\n\n    Suppose several =\r\nmantras you find natural attraction for have the descendants of a specific =\r\nMaharshi as the rishi. Then you may have a connection with that Maharshi. Y=\r\nou can try praying to him.\n\n    Best regards,\n    Narasimha\n    -----------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\n    Do a Short Homa=\r\nm Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n    Do Pitri Tarpanas Your=\r\nself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n    Spirituality: http://group=\r\ns.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedic=\r\nastro.home.comcast.net\n    Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAstrologer.org\n    Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan=\r\nnath.org\n    --------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---- \n\n      ----- Original Message ----- \n      From: rajarshi nandy \n    =\r\n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n      Sent: Thursday, September 25, 200=\r\n8 1:30 AM\n      Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Anyone knows mantra for Kas=\r\nhyap Rishi?\n\n            Dear Narasimhaji\n\n            I had a question abo=\r\nut Rishis.

Mere perception of objects by the senses is not the problem. T=\r\nhe \n    tendency of mind to be find some attractive and find some repulsive=\r\n is the \n    problem.

Then one becomes an \n    instrument of nature (=\r\nPrakriti) and implements the wish of nature through \n    one&#39;s actions, whi=\r\nch are performed without any attachment or personal \n    identification.

Even if the computer process has finished \n    all the initialization=\r\n and early work, the newly spawned thread has to go \n    through initializa=\r\ntion etc again. Similarly, the person born with amsa has \n    to go through=\r\n the process of overcoming weaknesses and realizing self all \n    over&nbsp=\r\n;again. When a Vivekananda is born from the amsa of a rishi, he may \n    ha=\r\nve to struggle initially and overcome the weaknesses and realize self all \n=\r\n    over again.
