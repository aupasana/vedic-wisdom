Borrowing the words of two modern masters whom I tend to respect a lot (=\r\n Sadhguru Jaggi vasudev and Paramahamsa Nithyananda ) ...\n\n&quot; Karma is creat=\r\ned deepest in the thought level rather than in the physical level &quot;\n\nIf you=\r\n think about it the act has already been committed on that plane of referen=\r\nce. \n\nIf we dream every day of killing a person the karma generated is said=\r\n to be three times stronger than actually killing the person. Same goes for=\r\n Sex .\n\n2.I do not wish to type the exact paragraph used by Vimalananda to =\r\nmaintain the focus on the discussion. But if you read the second book he cl=\r\nearly advises the same thing Manish ji recently said in his mail . Use the =\r\nact of sex also for divine worship. Keep the mind focussed on god .\n\nI have=\r\n read very little of the vedas but from the little understanding of the Ath=\r\narva veda , the female organ and male organ are compared to a blazing fire =\r\nand the ghee ladle and the act is similar to an homa. I am sorry if this of=\r\nfends the purists but this is the truth. \n\n3.Continuing on similar lines  t=\r\nhe act of eating is also recommended by Vimalananda as an internal homa . I=\r\nn other places like the Upanishads this art is expounded as Vaishvanara Vid=\r\nya ...using the internal jathara agni to make an offering of food.\n\n\nThe tr=\r\nick is not in repressing it ...neither in embracing it . What use is abstin=\r\nence if you think about it all day. Like Thakur says in one of the parables=\r\n of the wish fulfilling tree...\n\nDismissing the visible world and its pleas=\r\nures and sorrows as maya is folly...for then the man has not learnt anythin=\r\ng.\n\nEmbracing the visible world and its pleasures and sorrows as maya is fo=\r\nlly too...for then also the man has not learnt anything.\n\n\nThe easiest way =\r\nis to trust the mother ...trust the medicine she gives and not run away fro=\r\nm relationships or fall heads over heels in the pursuit of those relationsh=\r\nips. Use each one of those opportunities to serve the divine in those forms=\r\n.\n\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I notice this=\r\n discussion has been mostly among men...\n&gt; \n&gt; Because women may not feel co=\r\nmfortable participating in such discussions it seems. it needs to be unders=\r\ntood that whatever is discussed on the topic of Brahmacharya, equally appli=\r\nes to Female Saadhakas also IMHO.\n&gt; \n&gt; offcourse, for married people, its m=\r\nuch more difficult and tricky becasue they have responsibilities towards th=\r\neir wives/husbands and consent of legitimate partner is of utmost important=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; forcible repression can have the opposite effet--flaring up of str=\r\nong sexual urges...\n&gt; \n&gt; True! however Sex impulse is such a force which ne=\r\neds vey very strong will as well as persistent efforts. Suspension (which i=\r\ns not forcible repression) is one important key. if people do not start to =\r\nthink about it and start exercising the opposite will to that mighty force,=\r\n births after births will go wasted, especially for those who care for high=\r\ner purpose of life.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com, Aditi Banerjee &lt;banerjeea@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I notice this dis=\r\ncussion has been mostly among men, many of whom appear to\n&gt; &gt; be married. I=\r\n would like to point out that brahmacharya should not be taken\n&gt; &gt; as a uni=\r\nlateral decision and that the wife&#39;s sexual needs also be honored\n&gt; &gt; and r=\r\nespected (whether verbally articulated or not). Even Ramakrishna\n&gt; &gt; offere=\r\nd Sarada that he would give up his sexual abstinence in order to\n&gt; &gt; fulfil=\r\nl his husbandly dharma towards her. Grhastha dharma in many of our\n&gt; &gt; scri=\r\nptures enjoins certain restrictions upon sexual behavior (e.g., not\n&gt; &gt; dur=\r\ning Ekadasi or other certain days, or so many days after a woman&#39;s menses\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; has ended, etc.), which are short of extended periods of sexual celibacy=\r\n but\n&gt; &gt; nevertheless accomplish the same ends (gradually, over time) of ch=\r\nanneling\n&gt; &gt; healthily, controlling, and then overcoming the desire for sex=\r\n. Also,\n&gt; &gt; forcible repression can have the opposite effet--flaring up of =\r\nstrong sexual\n&gt; &gt; urges that can be more problematic later on if healthy re=\r\nlease is not\n&gt; &gt; allowed. A lot of problems in the Catholic church, ISKCON =\r\nand now BAPS are\n&gt; &gt; attributable to this.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Wed, Mar 3, 2010 at =\r\n10:27 AM, vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Vi=\r\njay,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I suggest reading &quot;Brahmacharya&quot; pdf in file section. The =\r\nmanual, written\n&gt; &gt; &gt; by Swami Sivananda, is comprehensive and throws light=\r\n on the topic in a big\n&gt; &gt; &gt; way. It probably answers many or all of your q=\r\nuestions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One thing is for sure - Swami Vivekananda (In Rajayog=\r\na book), Sivananda (In\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Manual mentioned above), Even unconvention=\r\nal Vimalanada (Aghora Part-2)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; agree, in no uncertain terms, that real=\r\n spiritual progress requires complete\n&gt; &gt; &gt; absent of Sex Idea and action.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom=\r\n@yahoogroups.com &lt;vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&gt;,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;pvklnrao&quot; &lt;pvklnr=\r\nao@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are some unanswered questions in my mind.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The argument involving Virya is not satisfying to me:\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; 1. This explanation is explaining predominantly from a male point of vi=\r\new\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. According the modern doctors, whether or not you do intention=\r\nally or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not, the Virya does not stay. It gets secreted any way.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; 3. Why so much focus or affinity for accumulation of energy? Yes, the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; common argument is that we need to accumulate spiritual energy to burn =\r\nour\n&gt; &gt; &gt; karma. But, why burn the karma? In several threads, the only abso=\r\nlute way of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; burning karma seem to be paying it up with out attachment=\r\n. It is all in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mind. In order to realise this and condition our m=\r\nind, do we really need\n&gt; &gt; &gt; energy. I trust, what we need is the resolve a=\r\nnd persistant effort.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. Is not the goal is not to have a goal? We =\r\nare advised not to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; anticipate/wish for an experiance while doing sadh=\r\nana. Once we manage to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana with out any anticipation, why all =\r\nthis focus on accumulating energy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or even obtaining Moksha?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; If the definition of Brahmacharya is to keep the mind in Brahman all=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time, then our actions do not result in any more karma because, =\r\nyour mind is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; focusing on brahman and hence you do not identify yourse=\r\nlf in your actions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You do them because you had to do them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps, best way to get this is not avoiding certain actions but, t=\r\nry\n&gt; &gt; &gt; developing ability to keep thinking about God while doing any/ever=\r\ny thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This reminds me a story I read in my child hood.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once Narada gets to proud that he is the best devotee as he =\r\nkeeps\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thinking of Narayana all the time. Vishnu disappoints him by na=\r\nming some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wood cutter as his best devotee. This wood cutter utters th=\r\ne name of Vishnu\n&gt; &gt; &gt; only few times during the day. Narada protests and t=\r\nhen Vishnu gives him a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wessel full of milk and asks him to put it on =\r\nhis head and walk around.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If can&#39;t stop sex, try to chant G=\r\nod&#39;s name while you are doing sex. If\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you can manage to decrease amou=\r\nnt of joy you derise out of sex, then you are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the correct path. Ni=\r\ngraha will come automatically if you stop enjoying\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
