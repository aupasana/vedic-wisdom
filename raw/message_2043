It really =\r\nhelps and I really appreciate\nyour time & patience in explaining it so beau=\r\ntifully for a layman.\n\nOne followup question:\n\nRegarding Homam - will it no=\r\nt depend on my chart? As per my chart (26/2/73,\n17:07, 87E19,23N29, Leo Lag=\r\nna) and my brief study of VRA/CoVA, My Isht devta\nwill be Shiva(Sun), Palan=\r\n devta is Samba siva (have not heard much about\nhim) and Guru Devta is Skan=\r\nada.\n\nFurther, As per inclination, I do feel great energy in SOME of shiva =\r\nand\nganesh temples(from last 3 years). It&#39;s a difficult to describe feeling=\r\n\n- it&#39;s as if a spiritual energy/vibration is surrounding me. Recently, I\nw=\r\nent to a shani( w/Hanuman & Ganesha) temple, and it also seemed to have\ngoo=\r\nd vibration to me. How do I reconcile these facts on choosing the homam?\nIs=\r\n it just the play of my mind to be ignored , or divine intervention to be\ni=\r\nnterpreted.\nOr\nif Mahaganapathi Homam is THE starting point before we go ah=\r\nead with any\neffort at reconciliation.\n\nThanks & Regards\n\nSanjay\n\n\n\nOn Thu,=\r\n Jun 25, 2009 at 8:29 AM, Narasimha P.V.R. Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; =EF=BB=BF Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt; (a) Correct. It is fine to work hard like a honey=\r\nbee, be engrossed in\n&gt; material life and feel many happinesses and sadnesse=\r\ns of life. The only\n&gt; thing missed out is self-realization and moksha.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n(b) Not exactly. Spiritual progress does not mean shunning material things.=\r\n\n&gt; Some people leave wife, children, house, car etc and live in forest, in =\r\nan\n&gt; attempt to get control over the mind and remove the attachment to and\n=\r\n&gt; dependency on those things. However, it is not necessary. One can remove =\r\nthe\n&gt; dependency on all things that surround one, even as one remains in th=\r\neir\n&gt; middle! Staying away from something is neither necessary nor sufficie=\r\nnt to\n&gt; overcome attachment. What things and people are around you and what=\r\n actions\n&gt; you engage in are *not *the problem that blocks you from moksha.=\r\n It is how\n&gt; *you* look at them and with what frame of mind *you *engage in=\r\n the actions\n&gt; that are the blockages. So the problem is not the material w=\r\norld around you,\n&gt; but *your own mind* that is the problem. Detachment does=\r\n not mean not\n&gt; loving or not engaging in actions. Detachment means loving =\r\nbut without\n&gt; expectations and engaging in actions but without expectations=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you give love and do not expect anything in return, if you put in =\r\nyour\n&gt; best effort towards what you see as your dharma for people around yo=\r\nu and do\n&gt; not worry about things that go wrong, if you focus on the presen=\r\nt and engage\n&gt; in the best possible actions without too much of worry or an=\r\nxiety about past\n&gt; or future, can there be anything more effective or effic=\r\nient than that?\n&gt;\n&gt; If one is like a drop of water on a lotus leaf and enga=\r\nges in actions\n&gt; without attachment, one is not necessarily a failure mater=\r\nially. Such a\n&gt; person will do *everything *a person with deep attachments =\r\ndoes, but only\n&gt; better! I say better, because a detached person does not w=\r\naste time worrying\n&gt; about things out of one&#39;s hand or things that went wro=\r\nng. A detached person\n&gt; always focuses on the best action to engage in *rig=\r\nht now *and does it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Let me put this in one sentence: Attachment does n=\r\not make you more\n&gt; effective or efficient. In fact, if anything, attachment=\r\n makes you less\n&gt; effective and efficient. If you are detached, you will gi=\r\nve unconditionally\n&gt; and engage in actions without any energy being dispers=\r\ned on worrying over\n&gt; things out of your control. Normal people waste a lot=\r\n of their time, energy\n&gt; and emotional space, worrying about things they ca=\r\nnnot control. A detached\n&gt; person does what is in one&#39;s control perfectly a=\r\nnd accepts the result\n&gt; whole-heartedly.\n&gt;\n&gt; (c) If you are a jeevanmukta, =\r\nyou will do everything you see as your\n&gt; dharma, but only better. You will =\r\nnot feel happy or sad or jealous and angry\n&gt; etc. Your mind will be in a st=\r\nable, peaceful and blissful state always. It\n&gt; is worth it. You are not get=\r\nting out of anything, but putting in the best\n&gt; effort.\n&gt;\n&gt; (e) Yes, do not=\r\n think of emancipation or liberation. Think one small step\n&gt; at a time. Thi=\r\nnk of getting some physical and mental discipline. Think of\n&gt; some minor co=\r\nntrol over mind. Thinking overcoming minor weaknesses. Start\n&gt; slowly.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n(f) There are many ways. The specific way using which many people will\n&gt; be=\r\nnefit in the next few centuries and the specific way which I am here to\n&gt; t=\r\neach is &quot;homam&quot; or fire ritual. When you are with a person, the physical\n&gt; =\r\nvibrations made by the person&#39;s lips can be heard physically by your ears.\n=\r\n&gt; Similarly, the vibrations made by his subtle body and mind can be &quot;heard&quot;=\r\n by\n&gt; your subtle body and mind. That is why we feel pleasant when we are w=\r\nith\n&gt; great saints and uneasy in some companies. The vibrations produced by=\r\n the\n&gt; subtle and causal bodies of people around us do have an impact on us=\r\n. Fire\n&gt; is one powerful object which has very pleasant, powerful and clean=\r\nsing\n&gt; vibrations at the subtle and causal levels. Being next to fire of a\n=\r\n&gt; reasonable size is like being with a great yogi.\n&gt;\n&gt; If one does a 20-40 =\r\nmin Mahaganapathi homam everyday for 2-3 years, things\n&gt; will automatically=\r\n start to fall in place.\n&gt;\n&gt; The problem you are seeking is your mind. The =\r\nsolution is also in your\n&gt; mind. You use your mind to train mind to let go =\r\nof its weaknesses and\n&gt; attachments one by one.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasim=\r\nha\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; D=\r\no a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&lt;http://www.v=\r\nedicastrologer.org/homam&gt;\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst=\r\nrologer.org/tarpana&lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&gt;\n&gt; Spirituality:=\r\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): h=\r\nttp://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; Sri Jagannath C=\r\nentre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org&lt;http://www.srijagannath.or=\r\ng/&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; *From:* Sanjay Prasad &lt;skprasad@...&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; *To:* vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; *Sent:* Wednesday, June 24, 2009 6:=\r\n17 AM\n&gt; *Subject:* Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Descent of the Supramenal Conscin=\r\nousness\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt;\n&gt; Very good article/discussion..Thanks for sh=\r\naring it.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I can, Let me also ask some basic questions. (I am very ne=\r\nw to all this.\n&gt; Search for some answers has brought me to this forum.)\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n a) Why Madhukaitam is  so bad/evil? Is it not that the world is being\n&gt; su=\r\nstained by people keeping their head down and doing the routine work? Do\n&gt; =\r\nwe not please the God by keeping our head down and playing the role assigne=\r\nd\n&gt; to us ? An obvious answer comes to mind is that it will keep us away fr=\r\nom\n&gt; emancipation and/self-actualization. Correct/Incorrect?\n&gt;\n&gt; b) So,  Is=\r\n spirituality and materialism two poles apart (and twain shall\n&gt; never meet=\r\n..). Say I wd like to reach the heights of professional success in\n&gt; my car=\r\neer, Am I doomed not to become a good spiritualist (???)? or, If I\n&gt; want t=\r\no become self-actualized by 2025, does it mean I should stop planning\n&gt; to =\r\nclimb the professional ladder? I do understand about &quot;Limited Bandwidth&quot;\n&gt; =\r\nissue - but, then I also read about King Janak. Can I combine these two - i=\r\nf\n&gt; yes, how?\n&gt;\n&gt;  c) Getting even more confused now,  Why do we say that e=\r\nmancipation is\n&gt; our spiritual goal. If GOD created us, and put us on this =\r\nstage - should our\n&gt; goal not be to play the role dutifully, which God want=\r\ns us to play. By\n&gt; seeking for emancipation, are we trying to get off the s=\r\ntage and trying to\n&gt; escape the role assigned to us. Are we not contradicti=\r\nng the God&#39;s scheme of\n&gt; things by trying to get out of the scheme?\n&gt;\n&gt; d) =\r\nOr, Is it part of God&#39;s scheme to put us in this &quot;maya&quot; first and then\n&gt; as=\r\nk us to get out of the &quot;maya&quot;? Why will he do so? I am sure he will not be\n=\r\n&gt; playing &quot;rats in the maze&quot; game. Then, why??\n&gt;\n&gt; e) Sometimes, I also thi=\r\nnk that all these above questions are meaningless.\n&gt; I look at my pre-schoo=\r\nl kid and the way she has put her faith in her\n&gt; teacher. She is not worryi=\r\nng about her profession or phd thesis right now.\n&gt; Similarly, probably, Ema=\r\nncipation/Merger in Cosmic soul etc are problems\n&gt; that we should not be th=\r\ninking at the begining of our spiritual journey -\n&gt; just look to learn/expe=\r\nrience more till we are ready (for what?)\n&gt;\n&gt; f) Then, what do we mean by s=\r\npiritual journey? where/how do we start? I\n&gt; thought about doing homam/reci=\r\nting mantra - but is that the right way? or\n&gt; there is another way. Probabl=\r\ny, there are many ways - then how do I choose\n&gt; my way? An &quot;user guide&quot; or =\r\n&quot; spirituality for dummies&quot; book  would have been\n&gt; useful. Do we have one?=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I will appreciate if you can take some time out to guide me here. In f=\r\nact,\n&gt; probably, I donot even have the right question right now - forget ab=\r\nout\n&gt; articulating them well and seeking the answer (I am seeking the probl=\r\nem :))\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt;\n&gt; Sanjay\n&gt;\n&gt; On Wed, Jun 24, 2009 at 9:12 AM, Narasimh=\r\na P.V.R.

As per Narayana sooktam, all go=\r\nds (including Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva,\n&gt; Indra etc) came from Narayana. As pe=\r\nr Ganapathi Atharva seersham, all gods\n&gt; (including Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, =\r\nIndra etc) came from Ganapathi. As per\n&gt; Ganapathi Atharva seersham, all go=\r\nds (including Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Indra\n&gt; etc) came from Ganapathi. As p=\r\ner Suryopanishat, all gods (including Brahma,\n&gt; Vishnu, Shiva, Indra etc) c=\r\name from Surya. And so on.\n&gt;\n&gt; The duality is so vast and yet non-duality i=\r\ns the underlying supreme\n&gt; reality in duality. Thus, the hierarchy within h=\r\nierarchy will have to start\n&gt; at the connection with non-duality and it is =\r\nnot one. In other words, any\n&gt; hierarchy given by anyone is with respect to=\r\n one perspective. I will not be\n&gt; too keen on finalizing one hierarchy, bec=\r\nause that cannot be done really. If\n&gt; you haven&#39;t before, do read the analo=\r\ngy in the last part of the mail\n&gt; mentioned above. It is an analogy worth g=\r\netting into your thinking system.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I mean is i=\r\nt the Rishi who is acting our the Mother&#39;s instructions\n&gt; &gt; or is it She wh=\r\no is creating the environment for the Rishi&#39;s wish\n&gt; &gt; to come true? Which =\r\none came first?\n&gt;\n&gt; There is no causal relationship between the two. Action=\r\ns of rishis and the\n&gt; will of the supreme cosmic being are in sync. They ju=\r\nst happen together.\n&gt; Neither causes the other.\n&gt;\n&gt; Rishis are the most per=\r\nfected beings without a trace of ego and yet\n&gt; performing actions of great =\r\nconsequence, with zero attachment. They operate\n&gt; right on the border of du=\r\nality and non-duality.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; As a devotee it is na=\r\ntural and simple to believe that the God I\n&gt; &gt; pray to is the Ultimate Supr=\r\neme authority, but when I hear that\n&gt; &gt; Rishis are even beyond this, then d=\r\noubt creeps in, is the deity\n&gt; &gt; therefore not as supreme as is made out to=\r\n be?\n&gt;\n&gt; Our ego does not leave us even in sadhana. Sometimes, one&#39;s belief=\r\n that\n&gt; one&#39;s guru is the best guru or the god one prays to is the supreme =\r\none is\n&gt; rooted in one&#39;e ego and one&#39;s need to be the best and be associate=\r\nd with the\n&gt; best. Just contemplate if that is the case and if it is, try t=\r\no root out\n&gt; such thinking.\n&gt;\n&gt; Having said that, do look at the god you pr=\r\nay to as the supreme and try to\n&gt; reach the supreme through him/her by surr=\r\nendering to him/her. If you take a\n&gt; low level manifestation of that deity,=\r\n then rishis may indeed be beyond\n&gt; him/her as Vimalananda said. But, if yo=\r\nu take the highest manifestation of\n&gt; the deity, as the supreme cosmic bein=\r\ng, then rishis are his playmates and\n&gt; neither above nor below.\n&gt;\n&gt; *      =\r\n  *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; If you take a company, there may be a chairman who may be =\r\nthe highest\n&gt; authority. But, it may be a ceremonial role and some may cons=\r\nider CEO to be\n&gt; higher while some may consider the chairman to be higher. =\r\nWhy bother about\n&gt; who is higher? In a company does well, they both work wi=\r\nth understanding.\n&gt;\n&gt; The hierarchy is irrelevant to one who is a clerk at =\r\nthe company.

For example, Aurobindo use=\r\nd to visit the house of Sister\n&gt; Nivedita, the foremost disciple of Swami V=\r\nivekananda and knew her well when\n&gt; he still lived in Calcutta. He had a vi=\r\nsion in his prison cell of Swami\n&gt; Vivekananda, just a few years after his =\r\ndeath, in which he imparted\n&gt; Aurobindo some key knowledge.

Trilinga Swami kne=\r\nw Lahiri mahashaya and admired him.\n&gt; And so on.\n&gt;\n&gt; Coming back to the mai=\r\nn point, the supermind established in the field of\n&gt; earth that was referre=\r\nd to by Aurobindo can simply be a maharshi paying some\n&gt; attention to matte=\r\nrs on earth. A maharshi absorbed in the divine in one of\n&gt; the higher plane=\r\ns of consciousness can accomplish huge changes on earth by\n&gt; the mere power=\r\n of his thought. If there is a divine play to make some\n&gt; positive changes =\r\non earth and a maharshi takes part in the play, he may\n&gt; focus a small part=\r\n of his supermind on the affairs of earth and direct a few\n&gt; important soul=\r\ns to do some key work. Some important souls (deities, rishis\n&gt; or yogis etc=\r\n) may send their amshas (partial essence) to be born on earth to\n&gt; fulfil d=\r\nifferent parts of a divine play.\n&gt;\n&gt; You may then see several (not just one=\r\n) elevated beings, enlightened beings\n&gt; and realized beings born on earth t=\r\no bring clarity in different aspects of\n&gt; spiritual knowledge. Each of them=\r\n will get specific internal/external\n&gt; guidance from the divine, based on w=\r\nhat their part in the play is.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt;  The &quot;Asura of F=\r\nalsehood&quot; that Aurobindo alluded to is all around us. At\n&gt; the subtlest lev=\r\nel, he manifests as false ego in pretty much everybody. At\n&gt; the grossest l=\r\nevel, he manifests as blatant lies, wrong propaganda etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; One should no=\r\nt tolerate this Asura (demon) and fight hard. However, one\n&gt; should not *ha=\r\nte* this Asura or those afflicted by him. When we encounter\n&gt; lies, we shou=\r\nld fight and stand for truth but not hate the liar at the same\n&gt; time. Ther=\r\ne is nothing that needs to be hated in this world. One should\n&gt; learn to do=\r\n the job assigned to one by Nature without attraction or\n&gt; repulsion to any=\r\nthing or anybody and with unconditional love (i.e. no\n&gt; expectations of a r=\r\neturn) to all.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; This was a very interesting read and matches what Nara=\r\nsimhaji\n&gt; &gt; says about changes coming in the world.\n&gt;\n&gt; I know very little.=\r\n But I was told that an age that is somewhat like the\n&gt; bygone ages will be=\r\n established on earth for a few hundred years in the\n&gt; coming decades. The =\r\nreason the Divine Mother appeared before Manish and\n&gt; asked him to spread s=\r\nimple homam procedures in the world was to prepare the\n&gt; grounds for that. =\r\nManish also told me that all this is the play of a senior\n&gt; maharshi.\n&gt;\n&gt; B=\r\nest regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- ---------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst r=\r\nologer.org/ homam&lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&gt;\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas=\r\n Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;http://www.vedicastrolo=\r\nger.org/tarpana&gt;\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wis=\r\ndom&lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&gt;\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3=\r\n): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;http:/=\r\n/www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www=\r\n.SriJagan nath.org&lt;http://www.srijagannath.org/&gt;\n&gt; ------------ --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message=\r\n -----\n&gt; *From:* Laxmi Narayan&lt;http://in.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=\r\n=3Dshrijishrihari@...&gt;\n&gt; *To:* vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;http:=\r\n//in.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; *S=\r\nent:* Sunday, June 21, 2009 6:50 PM\n&gt; *Subject:* Re: [vedic-wisdom] Descent=\r\n of the Supramenal Conscinousness\n&gt;\n&gt;   Hi, Some time back I saw  similar a=\r\nrticle and was intrigued by it.

I a=\r\nm\n&gt; posting it here for anyone interested.\n&gt;\n&gt; Near the beginning of the 20=\r\nth century the great Indian freedom fighter and\n&gt; yogi-sage, Sri Aurobindo,=\r\n began to express a truth which had not been\n&gt; expressed before. In his hig=\r\nh states of divine union he saw that the time\n&gt; had come for a new stage in=\r\n the evolution of mankind. He saw that the divine\n&gt; was to manifest right h=\r\nere on Earth and that the time for this divine\n&gt; emergence into Earth life =\r\nwas now. He spoke of heaven descending to Earth,\n&gt; even as Earth experience=\r\nd a breakdown due to the intrinsic resistance held\n&gt; within her material bo=\r\ndy towards this =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD\n&gt; =EF=BF=BD\n&gt; Sri Aurobindo was =\r\njoined in Pondicherry, India, by a French mystic, Mirra\n&gt; Alfassa, who late=\r\nr became known as the Mother. Together they embarked on a\n&gt; journey of inte=\r\nnsive cellular transformation that is very relevant to the\n&gt; colossal uncer=\r\ntainties we face today.\n&gt; =EF=BF=BD\n&gt; Sri Aurobindo saw that the divine for=\r\nce permeates all matter, and that all\n&gt; matter therefore has a force of con=\r\nsciousness. The process of the divine\n&gt; spirit descending down into matter =\r\nis called involution. The process by\n&gt; which the divine ascends back upward=\r\ns out of matter is called evolution.\n&gt; According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity=\r\n has reached a stage where these two\n&gt; events are occurring simultaneously,=\r\n and in his inner visions, he foresaw\n&gt; that we would soon be experiencing =\r\na descent of what he called =EF=BF=BDsupramental\n&gt; (or monadic) consciousne=\r\nss=EF=BF=BD that would entirely change everything on Earth.\n&gt; =EF=BF=BD\n&gt; M=\r\nan=EF=BF=BDs greatness is not in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in wha=\r\nt he\n&gt; makes possible. An immortal soul is somewhere within him, even if se=\r\nldom\n&gt; active in most people, while an eternal spirit overshadows him, even=\r\n if\n&gt; obstructed from descent by the hard lid of his constructed personalit=\r\ny.\n&gt; There is a great divine plan in motion, even if the evidence of the ou=\r\nter\n&gt; senses seems to contradict it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sri Aurobindo recognized that huma=\r\nnkind is going through an evolutionary\n&gt; crisis. A stage has been reached i=\r\nn which the human mind has made tremendous\n&gt; strides on the one hand, but i=\r\ns left hopelessly inadequate to prevent its\n&gt; own extinction as a species. =\r\nMeanwhile, as the Mother testified before her\n&gt; death in 1973, a consciousn=\r\ness higher than the human rational mind, what may\n&gt; be termed the Supermind=\r\n, has recently been established in the fields of the\n&gt; Earth, and is active=\r\n there. Our task now is to bring it down into cellular\n&gt; consciousness.\n&gt; E=\r\nvolution took a great leap forward with the origins of Life, and later\n&gt; wi=\r\nth the emergence of Mind. We are now at the threshold of another leap\n&gt; for=\r\nward, even more momentous, as we prepare for the emergence of the\n&gt; Supermi=\r\nnd. Sri Aurobindo speaks about four stages of human evolution, which\n&gt; we w=\r\nill soon be starting to experience concurrently upon Earth. The first is\n&gt; =\r\n=EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current species, a rational being posse=\r\nssing an\n&gt; individualized soul, but largely obstructed from contacting and =\r\nmerging with\n&gt; it.\n&gt; =EF=BF=BD\n&gt; Next is the =EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD=\r\n a species that is spontaneous- ly coming to\n&gt; birth under the influence of=\r\n an ever-expanding supramental field, a being\n&gt; that is largely able to mer=\r\nge and live from soul-consciousness rather than\n&gt; mind-consciousness.\n&gt;\n&gt; T=\r\nhirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still inhabit a dense phy=\r\nsical body, but\n&gt; will be in possession of the Mind of Light, which is supr=\r\namental\n&gt; consciousness that has begun to merge with cellular consciousness=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; Finally, our ultimate goal as a species is the =EF=BF=BDSupramental B=\r\neing,=EF=BF=BD\n&gt; divinity incarnated fully within the subtle realms of matt=\r\ner. This will be a\n&gt; race of what we could call =EF=BF=BDDescended Masters.=\r\n=EF=BF=BD In this species, the unity\n&gt; of matter and spirit would be fully =\r\nrealized upon Earth.\n&gt; The great work of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was i=\r\nn bringing supramental\n&gt; consciousness down into the cellular consciousness=\r\n of their own bodies.\n&gt; Since this is a unified consciousness, this meant t=\r\nhat the supramental\n&gt; consciousness was simultaneously being brought into t=\r\nhe consciousness fields\n&gt; of the Earth, awaiting the moment when it would f=\r\nlower into its full\n&gt; manifestation in collective matter.\n&gt; Whenever there =\r\nis a =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is corresponding resistance. Sri\n&gt; Aur=\r\nobindo and the Mother speak of their experience with the four =EF=BF=BDAsur=\r\nas,=EF=BF=BD\n&gt; essentially anti-divine forces, at work in the world today. =\r\nThere is the\n&gt; Asura of Darkness, the Asura of Suffering, The Asura of Fals=\r\nehood, and the\n&gt; Asura of Death. These are the forces that are so outwardly=\r\n apparent, and\n&gt; which seem to be in control of current global events. Acco=\r\nrding to them the\n&gt; Asura of Darkness (Lucifer?) has gone through a transfo=\r\nrmation recently, and\n&gt; the Asura of Suffering has returned to Source, and =\r\nso only the latter two\n&gt; still remain to wreak havoc on Earth. Interestingl=\r\ny, they spoke of the Asura\n&gt; of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD thro=\r\nugh Hitler during World War II, and of their\n&gt; own intensive inner work in =\r\ncountering his influence. It would not be\n&gt; difficult to see how this same =\r\nAsura may be influencing other world leaders\n&gt; in the current political sph=\r\nere.\n&gt; With the descent of this new vibratory consciousness all our old obs=\r\nolete\n&gt; human structures will be demolished. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasi=\r\nzed that\n&gt; although the changes will be enormous they would not be necessar=\r\nily\n&gt; catastrophic. The power of Truth automatically erases Falsehood, and =\r\nour\n&gt; world for the most part consists of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, =\r\nhe\n&gt; maintained, carried a power of harmonization which could overcome this=\r\n\n&gt; resistance by means other than dramatic struggle and violence. The Asura=\r\ns\n&gt; will eventually be absorbed into their original emanations of Light, Li=\r\nfe,\n&gt; Beauty, and Truth. It may be interesting to speculate, with all the v=\r\niolence\n&gt; in the world today, the destruction we might have experienced if =\r\nnot for\n&gt; this power of harmonization!\n&gt; *When does all this happen? Sri Au=\r\nrobindo and the Mother believed that the\n&gt; world stage was set for this qua=\r\nntum descent, and that it was quite\n&gt; imminent. The Mother said in 1968 tha=\r\nt the supramental transformation was a\n&gt; certainty now, and that it would c=\r\nome about with a minimum of destruction,\n&gt; =EF=BF=BDalthough this minimum i=\r\ns still considerable.=EF=BF=BD She said that the year 2000\n&gt; would be a tur=\r\nning point.*\n&gt; **\n&gt; This was a very interesting read and matches what Naras=\r\nimhaji says about\n&gt; changes coming in the world.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; * The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; *\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\r\n--00504502c7a78c9be5046d24c2fa\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;Dear Narasimhaji &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Namaste,&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Thanks for the=C2=A0detailed explanation.

It&#39;s a difficul=\r\nt to describe feeling -=C2=A0it&#39;s as if a spiritual energy/vibration is=\r\n surrounding me.=C2=A0Recently, I went to a=C2=A0shani( w/Hanuman=C2=A0&amp=\r\n; Ganesha)=C2=A0temple, and it also seemed to have good vibration to me. Ho=\r\nw do I reconcile these facts on choosing the homam? Is it just the play of =\r\nmy mind to be ignored=C2=A0, or divine intervention to be interpreted.=C2=\r\n=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;Or &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;if=C2=A0Mahaganapathi Homam is THE starting =\r\npoint before we go ahead with any effort at reconciliation.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Thanks &amp; Regards&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Sanjay&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Thu, Jun 25, 200=\r\n9 at 8:29 AM, Narasimha P.V.R.

Spiritual progress d=\r\noes not mean shunning material things. Some people leave wife, children, ho=\r\nuse, car etc and live in forest, in an attempt to get control over the mind=\r\n and remove the attachment to and dependency on those things. However, it i=\r\ns not necessary. One can remove the dependency on all things that surround =\r\none, even as one remains in their middle! Staying away from something is ne=\r\nither necessary nor sufficient to overcome attachment.=C2=A0What things and=\r\n people are around you and what actions you engage in are &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;the =\r\nproblem that blocks you from moksha. It is how &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; look at them an=\r\nd with what frame of mind &lt;em&gt;you &lt;/em&gt;engage in the actions that are the b=\r\nlockages. So the problem is not the material world around you, but &lt;em&gt;your=\r\n own mind&lt;/em&gt; that is the problem. Detachment does not mean not loving or =\r\nnot engaging in actions. Detachment means loving but without expectations a=\r\nnd engaging in actions but without expectations.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font f=\r\nace=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=\r\n=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;If you give love and do not expect anything in return, if you put in=\r\n your best effort towards what you see as your dharma for people around you=\r\n and do not worry about things that go wrong, if you focus on the present a=\r\nnd engage in the best possible actions without too much of worry or anxiety=\r\n about past or future, can there be anything more effective or efficient th=\r\nan that?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;If one is like a drop of water on=\r\n a lotus leaf and engages in actions without attachment, one is not necessa=\r\nrily a failure materially. Such a person will do &lt;em&gt;everything &lt;/em&gt;a pers=\r\non with deep attachments does, but only better! I say better, because a det=\r\nached person does not waste time worrying about things out of one&#39;s han=\r\nd or things that went wrong. A detached person always focuses on the best a=\r\nction to engage in &lt;em&gt;right now &lt;/em&gt;and does it.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font=\r\n face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; si=\r\nze=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Let me put this in one sentence: Attachment does not make you more=\r\n effective or efficient. In fact, if anything, attachment makes you less ef=\r\nfective and efficient. If you are detached, you will give unconditionally a=\r\nnd engage in actions without any energy being dispersed on worrying over th=\r\nings out of your control. Normal people waste a lot of their time, energy a=\r\nnd emotional space, worrying about things they cannot control. A detached p=\r\nerson does what is in one&#39;s control perfectly and accepts the result wh=\r\nole-heartedly.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/f=\r\nont&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;(c) If you are a jeevanmukt=\r\na, you will do everything you see as your dharma, but only better.

Similarl=\r\ny, the vibrations made by his subtle body and mind can be &quot;heard&quot;=\r\n by your subtle body and mind.

(I am very new to all th=\r\nis. Search for some answers has brought me to this forum.) &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;fon=\r\nt face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;a) Why Madhukaitam is =\r\n=C2=A0so bad/evil? Is it not that the world is being sustained by people ke=\r\neping their head down and doing the routine work? Do we not please the God =\r\nby keeping our head down and playing the role assigned to us ? An obvious a=\r\nnswer comes to mind is that it will keep us away from emancipation and/self=\r\n-actualization. Correct/Incorrect? &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=\r\n=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;b) So,=C2=A0 Is spirituality and materialis=\r\nm two poles apart (and twain shall never meet..). Say I wd like to reach th=\r\ne heights of professional success in my career, Am I doomed not to become a=\r\n good spiritualist (???)? or, If I want to become self-actualized by 2025, =\r\ndoes it mean I should stop planning to climb the professional ladder? I do =\r\nunderstand about &quot;Limited Bandwidth&quot; issue - but, then I also rea=\r\nd about King Janak. Can I combine these two - if yes, how?&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;fon=\r\nt face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;c) Getting even =\r\nmore confused now,=C2=A0 Why do we say that emancipation is our=C2=A0spirit=\r\nual goal. If GOD created us, and put us on this stage - should our goal not=\r\n be to play the role dutifully, which God wants us to play. By seeking for =\r\nemancipation, are we trying to get off the stage and trying to escape the r=\r\nole assigned to us. Are we not contradicting the God&#39;s scheme of things=\r\n by trying to get out of the scheme? &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=\r\n=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;d) Or, Is it part of God&#39;s scheme to pu=\r\nt us in this &quot;maya&quot; first and then ask us to get out of the &quot=\r\n;maya&quot;? Why will he do so? I am sure he will not be playing=C2=A0&quot=\r\n;rats in the maze&quot; game. Then, why??&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; =\r\nsize=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;e) Sometimes, I also think that all the=\r\nse above questions are meaningless. I look at my pre-school kid and the way=\r\n she has put her faith in her teacher. She is not worrying about her profes=\r\nsion or phd thesis right now. Similarly, probably,=C2=A0Emancipation/Merger=\r\n in Cosmic soul etc are problems that we should not be thinking at the begi=\r\nning of our spiritual journey - just look to learn/experience more till we =\r\nare ready (for what?)&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;f) Then, what do we mean by spiritual journey? where/how =\r\ndo we start? I thought about doing homam/reciting mantra - but is that the =\r\nright way? or there is another way. Probably, there are many ways - then ho=\r\nw do I choose my way? An &quot;user guide&quot; or &quot; spirituality for =\r\ndummies&quot; book=C2=A0 would have been useful. Do we have one?&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;I will appreciat=\r\ne if you can take some time out to guide me here. In fact, probably, I dono=\r\nt even have the right question right now - forget about articulating them w=\r\nell and seeking the answer (I am seeking the problem :))&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font =\r\nface=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Regards&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font=\r\n face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Sanjay&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;On Wed, Jun 24, 2009 at 9:12 AM, Narasimha P.V.R.

As per Narayana sooktam, all gods (including Brah=\r\nma, Vishnu, Shiva, Indra etc) came from Narayana. As per Ganapathi Atharva =\r\nseersham, all gods (including Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Indra etc) came from G=\r\nanapathi. As per Ganapathi Atharva seersham, all gods (including Brahma, Vi=\r\nshnu, Shiva, Indra etc) came from Ganapathi.

Thus, the hierarchy within hi=\r\nerarchy will have to start at the connection with non-duality and it is not=\r\n one. In other words, any hierarchy given by anyone is with respect to one =\r\nperspective. I will not be too keen on finalizing one hierarchy, because th=\r\nat cannot be done really.

In =\r\nhis high states of divine union he saw that the time had come for a new sta=\r\nge in the evolution of mankind. He saw that the divine was to manifest righ=\r\nt here on Earth and that the time for this divine emergence into Earth life=\r\n was now. He spoke of heaven descending to Earth, even as Earth experienced=\r\n a breakdown due to the intrinsic resistance held within her material body =\r\ntowards this =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD&lt;br&gt;\n=EF=BF=BD&lt;br&gt;Sri Aurobindo was =\r\njoined in Pondicherry, India, by a French mystic, Mirra Alfassa, who later =\r\nbecame known as the Mother. Together they embarked on a journey of intensiv=\r\ne cellular transformation that is very relevant to the colossal uncertainti=\r\nes we face today.&lt;br&gt;\n=EF=BF=BD&lt;br&gt;Sri Aurobindo saw that the divine force =\r\npermeates all matter, and that all matter therefore has a force of consciou=\r\nsness. The process of the divine spirit descending down into matter is call=\r\ned involution. The process by which the divine ascends back upwards out of =\r\nmatter is called evolution. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reache=\r\nd a stage where these two events are occurring simultaneously, and in his i=\r\nnner visions, he foresaw that we would soon be experiencing a descent of wh=\r\nat he called =EF=BF=BDsupramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=BD that =\r\nwould entirely change everything on Earth.&lt;br&gt;\n=EF=BF=BD&lt;br&gt;Man=EF=BF=BDs g=\r\nreatness is not in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in what he makes pos=\r\nsible. An immortal soul is somewhere within him, even if seldom active in m=\r\nost people, while an eternal spirit overshadows him, even if obstructed fro=\r\nm descent by the hard lid of his constructed personality. There is a great =\r\ndivine plan in motion, even if the evidence of the outer senses seems to co=\r\nntradict it.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=\r\n=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sri Aurobindo recognized that humankind is=\r\n going through an evolutionary crisis. A stage has been reached in which th=\r\ne human mind has made tremendous strides on the one hand, but is left hopel=\r\nessly inadequate to prevent its own extinction as a species. Meanwhile, as =\r\nthe Mother testified before her death in 1973, a consciousness higher than =\r\nthe human rational mind, what may be termed the Supermind, has recently bee=\r\nn established in the fields of the Earth, and is active there. Our task now=\r\n is to bring it down into cellular consciousness.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Evolution=\r\n took a great leap forward with the origins of Life, and later with the eme=\r\nrgence of Mind. We are now at the threshold of another leap forward, even m=\r\nore momentous, as we prepare for the emergence of the Supermind. Sri Aurobi=\r\nndo speaks about four stages of human evolution, which we will soon be star=\r\nting to experience concurrently upon Earth. The first is =EF=BF=BDanimal hu=\r\nman,=EF=BF=BD our current species, a rational being possessing an individua=\r\nlized soul, but largely obstructed from contacting and merging with it.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n=EF=BF=BD&lt;br&gt;Next is the =EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a species that is =\r\nspontaneous- ly coming to birth under the influence of an ever-expanding su=\r\npramental field, a being that is largely able to merge and live from soul-c=\r\nonsciousness rather than mind-consciousness. &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Ari=\r\nal&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Thirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=\r\n=BF=BD who will still inhabit a dense physical body, but will be in possess=\r\nion of the Mind of Light, which is supramental consciousness that has begun=\r\n to merge with cellular consciousness. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; siz=\r\ne=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Finally, our ultimate goal as a species is=\r\n the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity incarnated fully within =\r\nthe subtle realms of matter.
