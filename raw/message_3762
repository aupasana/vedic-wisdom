The Maharshi went through it with interest, but then\nsaid =\r\nthat he had not the money to buy such expensive things. =E2=80=9CIf that\nme=\r\ndicine is good for me, it must necessarily be good for all the others\nhere.=\r\n Can you give it to them also as well as to me?

No, no, that can=E2=80=99t be!=E2=80=9D\n\nIn 1942 Ramana had a ba=\r\nd fall. A dog was chasing a squirrel and he wanted to\nhold the dog back and=\r\n so stretched out his walking stick, as a result he\nslipped and broke his c=\r\nollarbone.\n\nSri Ramana always read the newspapers and he and his devotees l=\r\nistened to\nthe news on the radio. Occasionally politics were discussed in t=\r\nhe\nHall. Professor\nSubbaramayya reports the following interesting conversat=\r\nion, =E2=80=9CIt was June\n10, 1940. The radio announced the fall of Paris t=\r\no Germany and the entry of\nItaly into the war against the Allies. =E2=80=A6=\r\n I had just heard a rumour that to\ncounteract the action of Italy, Turkey h=\r\nad declared war on the side of the\nAllies. I asked Narayana Iyer, who was t=\r\nhe latest arrival from the town\nwhether he had heard any such announcement =\r\non the radio. Before Narayana\nIyer could reply, Sri Bhagavan Himself said =\r\n=E2=80=98No, it cannot be true.=E2=80=99\nNarayana Iyer confirmed this rare =\r\nreply of Sri Bhagavan, and turning to me,\nobserved =E2=80=98France, a first=\r\n-rate Power has fallen in three days, Then do you\nthink our Britain can hol=\r\nd out longer than three weeks at the most?=E2=80=99 Upon\nthis, Sri Bhagavan=\r\n again observed =E2=80=98Um! =E2=80=93 but Russia =E2=80=93 =E2=80=98 Abrup=\r\ntly Sri\nBhagavan cut short his speech and resumed silence. Neither of us ha=\r\nd the\ncourage to ask Sri Bhagavan what Russia was going to do, though it ap=\r\npeared\nstrange that Sri Bhagavan should mention Russia who was at that time=\r\n\nfriendly to Germany. It will be remembered that war broke out between\nGerm=\r\nany and Russia only one year afterwards,and it was in fact Germany=E2=80=99=\r\ns\nattack on Russia that turned the tide of fortune in favour of the Allies.=\r\n=E2=80=9D\n\nWhen on 30th January 1948 Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated in New=\r\n Delhi, the\nwhole of India went into mourning. A newspaper reporter came to=\r\n the Ashram\nto ask the Maharshi his opinion about the tragedy. Ramana said =\r\nwith a\nshaking voice, =E2=80=9CFor the Mahatma=E2=80=99s death in this trag=\r\nic manner, every\nperson=E2=80=99s heart is mourning.What is there in partic=\r\nular that I could say? Who\nis there who is not grieved? If I say anything, =\r\nyou will publish it and\nthen, one after another, people will come and ask m=\r\ne. What is the good of\nit?=E2=80=9D With these words he sent the reporter a=\r\nway and went for his walk. At\nhalf past four the women sang =E2=80=98Raghup=\r\nati Raghava Rajaram=E2=80=99 (one of Mahatma\nGandhi=E2=80=99s favourite son=\r\ngs). With tears in his eyes Ramana indicated that they\nshould continue with=\r\n the singing.At 5 p.m. a conch was blown and an\narati-celebration (waving o=\r\nf lights) was held in the Mother=E2=80=99s Temple for the\ndeath of the Maha=\r\ntma.\n\nAfter Gandhi&#39;s assassination the whole country was plunged into turmo=\r\nil.\nThere were arson attacks and murders everywhere. The radio in the Hall\n=\r\nreported that the situation was very serious. In Tiruvannamalai too people\n=\r\nwere worried and the town was placed under police guard. Sri Ramana=E2=80=\r\n=99s grand\nnephew V. Ganesan reports,=E2=80=9CIt was 9.30 in the morning. S=\r\nuddenly loud cries\nof =E2=80=98Catch them, kill them=E2=80=99 were heard. O=\r\nne mad crowd was chasing another and\nall of them entered the Ashram from th=\r\ne hill-side. There was panic inside\nthe Ashram. A devotee in the Old Hall r=\r\nushed to the doors and bolted them;\nthe meditating devotees were naturally =\r\ndisturbed. In the midst of all the\ntense commotion, Bhagavan was unperturbe=\r\nd, a picture of attention,\ncorrecting some proof.=E2=80=9D\n\nThe first signs=\r\n of Ramana=E2=80=99s illness appeared in early 1949, when he would\noften ru=\r\nb his left elbow. An attendant who examined the spot found a boil\nthe size =\r\nof a pea, which rapidly grew and was soon as big as a marble. Although\nit s=\r\neemed to be harmless it was nevertheless removed on 9th February by the\nAsh=\r\nram doctor Dr. Shankar Rao and the retired surgeon Dr. Srinivasa Rao,\nwitho=\r\nut consulting any other doctors. The operation was performed in the\nbathroo=\r\nm before breakfast.\n\nAfter the operation Ramana did his best to hide the wo=\r\nund with his towel.\nWhen people asked what he had on his arm, he joked, =E2=\r\n=80=9CI am wearing a\nbracelet=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9CA lingam is born.=E2=80=\r\n=9D The wound took about ten days to heal.\n\nIt was not long, however, befor=\r\ne another, larger and more painful growth\nappeared. Renowned doctors from M=\r\nadras were consulted and they diagnosed it\nas a malignant tumour.\n\nOn 1st M=\r\nay Dr. Raghavachari declared that amputation of the arm was\nunavoidable. Bu=\r\nt Ramana refused, =E2=80=9CThere is no need for alarm. The body is\nitself a=\r\n disease. Let it have its natural end. Why mutilate it? Simple\ndressing of =\r\nthe affected part is enough.=E2=80=9D\n\nThe doctors also thought that the su=\r\nn would be beneficial for the sick arm.\nSo they would arrange a seat for Ra=\r\nmana outside behind the cow shed, remove\nthe bandage there and clean the wo=\r\nund. The affected part was then exposed to\nthe sun=E2=80=99s rays for some =\r\ntime. On one occasion devotees again expressed their\nworries and fears, but=\r\n he merely joked about his bleeding ulcer, =E2=80=9CSee how\nnice it is! It =\r\nis like a precious ruby. It has become an ornament to my arm.\nSee how red i=\r\nt is! It is glowing brilliantly with the sun=E2=80=99s rays falling on\nit. =\r\nLook at it!=E2=80=9D\n\nThe ayurvedic healer who had successfully treated Ram=\r\nana=E2=80=99s broken\ncollarbone, tried a treatment using a poultice of heal=\r\ning green leaves. One\nevening Ramana returned from his walk shivering with =\r\nfever and, walking with\nan extremely unsteady gait, was barely able to reac=\r\nh his couch. Shantamma,\nwho could not control her grief at this sight, crie=\r\nd out, =E2=80=9COh! Your body=E2=80=A6.=E2=80=9D,\nbut before she was able t=\r\no complete the sentence the Maharshi interrupted\nher, =E2=80=9COho! The bod=\r\ny? What about it? What has happened? Shivering? What if it\nis shivering? Wh=\r\nat you want is that there should be life in this body.Life\nis in it. Are yo=\r\nu satisfied?=E2=80=9D Finally he managed to control the shivering,\nand look=\r\ning at the people around him, said, =E2=80=9CThis is Nataraja=E2=80=99s dan=\r\nce. Daily\nit is a stationary darshan. Today it is tandava darshan [dancing =\r\ndarshan].\nWhy should there be any worry on that account?=E2=80=9D Then he k=\r\nept silent. The\nsuspicion was that the shivering was caused by an infection=\r\n brought on by\nthe green leaves. So this treatment was stopped.\n\nSri Ramana=\r\n found it increasingly difficult to climb the steps of the eastern\nentrance=\r\n of the New Hall. When it was suggested that he should use the\nnorthern ent=\r\nrance, where the steps were not so high, he refused, as the\nnorthern part o=\r\nf the Hall was the women=E2=80=99s area and he did not want to\ndisturb them=\r\n by entering there. But from now on, whenever he was not giving\ndarshan, he=\r\n remained in the small room on the eastern side of the New Hall,\nwhich had =\r\nits own bath. This room became known as the =E2=80=98Nirvana room=E2=80=99,=\r\n as it\nwas here that he died.\n\nOn 19th March, the Telugu New Year, Sri Rama=\r\nna had a bad accident.When he\nentered his bathroom in the morning, he stumb=\r\nled over the threshold and\nfell. A devotee wanted to help him up, but he re=\r\nfused and stood up by\nhimself, albeit with difficulty. His koupina and his =\r\ntowel were covered in\nblood. He probably had a fracture, but his attendant =\r\nwas not allowed to make\nit public. The part of his body on which he had fal=\r\nlen, started to suppurate\nand was very painful, but this too was concealed.=\r\n That day Ramana sat as\nusual from 9 a.m. onwards on the veranda of the lit=\r\ntle room to give darshan.\n\nOn the night before the 14th April Sri Ramana as=\r\nked everyone to go to bed or\nto meditate and leave him alone. Even his atte=\r\nndants he sent away. The next\nmorning he said in English to his attendant R=\r\nangaswami, who had just\nfinished massaging him, =E2=80=9Cthanks=E2=80=9D. R=\r\nangaswami, who knew no English, looked\nastonished, so Sri Ramana smiled and=\r\n explained the meaning to him, =E2=80=9CThe\nEnglish have a word =E2=80=98th=\r\nanks=E2=80=99, but we only say =E2=80=98santosham=E2=80=99 (I am pleased).=\r\n=E2=80=9D\n\nUntil the last Sri Ramana showed his concern for the animals.Som=\r\ne hours\nbefore his death he asked if the peacocks, whom he heard screeching=\r\n, had had\ntheir food. The animals reacted to his approaching end. The peaco=\r\ncks walked\nround his room, the cows,dogs, monkeys, birds, all showed their =\r\naffection in\ntheir own way.But the white peacock stood on the roof of the N=\r\nirvana room\nscreeching uninterruptedly.\n\nOn 14th April 1950 At 8.47 p.m., w=\r\nithout any struggle, his breathing\nstopped. There was no other sign of deat=\r\nh,only that the next breath did not\ncome.\n\nThe French photographer Henri Ca=\r\nrtier-Bresson,who had been staying at the\nAshram for two weeks, rushed into=\r\n the Nirvana room shortly after the moment\nof the Maharshi=E2=80=99s\ndeath =\r\nand asked those present for the exact minute of his death.He later\nreported=\r\n, =E2=80=9CI was in the open space in front of my house,when my friends dre=\r\nw\nmy attention to the sky, where I saw a vividly-luminous shooting star wit=\r\nh a\nluminous tail, unlike any shooting star I had before seen, coming from =\r\nthe\nSouth, moving slowly across the sky and, reaching the top of Arunachala=\r\n,\ndisappeared behind it. Because of its singularity we all guessed its impo=\r\nrt\nand immediately looked at our watches =E2=80=93 it was 8.47 =E2=80=93 an=\r\nd then raced to the\nAshram only to find that our premonition had been only\n=\r\ntoo sadly true: the Master had passed into mahanirvana at that very minute.=\r\n=E2=80=9D\n\nThis unusual phenomenon was witnessed by large numbers of people=\r\n over a wide\narea. On 16th April all English and Tamil newspapers published=\r\n reports on\nthe death of the Maharshi and also about the appearance of the =\r\nshooting\nstar.\n\nThe crowd of people was so large that the twenty policemen =\r\nwere barely able\nto keep them under control. Cohen reports that about 40,00=\r\n0 people came\nduring the day to pay their last respects to Sri Ramana.\n\nBut=\r\n as the Maharshi spent 54 years of his life in Tiruvannamalai and 28 of\nthe=\r\nm at Ramanashram,his presence is felt there with special intensity.\n\nIt is,=\r\n nevertheless, very important to point out that the true experience of\nthe =\r\npresence of Ramana and Arunachala must be in the Heart, it is not bound\nby =\r\ntime or place, and everything else has only the limited value of a\nmanifest=\r\nation. =E2=80=9CWhere could I go? I am here=E2=80=9D means that he is the H=\r\neart of\nall living beings, the Self, as it states in Chapter X, verse 20 of=\r\n the\nBhagavad Gita, his favourite verse, =E2=80=9CI am the Self, Oh Gudakes=\r\na, dwelling in\nthe Heart of every being; I am the beginning, the middle and=\r\n also the end of\nall living beings.=E2=80=9D\n\nRamana describes Realization =\r\nof the Self as follows, =E2=80=9CIn a pinhole camera,\nwhen the hole is smal=\r\nl, you see shapes and colours. When the hole is made\nbig, the images disapp=\r\near and one sees only clear light. Similarly when the\nmind is small and nar=\r\nrow, it is full of shapes and words. When it broadens,\nit sees pure light. =\r\nWhen the box is destroyed altogether, only the light\nremains.=E2=80=9D\n\n\nSo=\r\nurce: Ramana Maharshi: His Life A biography by Gabriele Ebert\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=\r\n=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=\r\n=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd13a328edfbc04802be7a1\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana;line-height:16px&quot;&gt;=\r\nRamachandra Rao, an ayurvedic healer and devotee, wanted to prepare a speci=\r\nal tonic for him and wrote a long list with all the ingredients and present=\r\ned it to Ramana.

Simple dressing of the affected part is enough.=E2=80=9D&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The =\r\ndoctors also thought that the sun would be beneficial for the sick arm. So =\r\nthey would arrange a seat for Ramana outside behind the cow shed, remove th=\r\ne bandage there and clean the wound. The affected part was then exposed to =\r\nthe sun=E2=80=99s rays for some time.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;=\r\n&gt;On one occasion devotees again expressed their worries and fears, but he m=\r\nerely joked about his bleeding ulcer, =E2=80=9CSee how nice it is! It is li=\r\nke a precious ruby. It has become an ornament to my arm. See how red it is!=\r\n It is glowing brilliantly with the sun=E2=80=99s rays falling on it. Look =\r\nat it!=E2=80=9D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The ayurvedic healer who had successfully t=\r\nreated Ramana=E2=80=99s broken collarbone, tried a treatment using a poulti=\r\nce of healing green leaves. One evening Ramana returned from his walk shive=\r\nring with fever and, walking with an extremely unsteady gait, was barely ab=\r\nle to reach his couch.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Shantamma, who=\r\n could not control her grief at this sight, cried out, =E2=80=9COh! Your bo=\r\ndy=E2=80=A6.=E2=80=9D, but before she was able to complete the sentence the=\r\n Maharshi interrupted her, =E2=80=9COho! The body? What about it? What has =\r\nhappened? Shivering? What if it is shivering? What you want is that there s=\r\nhould be life in this body.Life is in it. Are you satisfied?=E2=80=9D Final=\r\nly he managed to control the shivering, and looking at the people around hi=\r\nm, said, =E2=80=9CThis is Nataraja=E2=80=99s dance. Daily it is a stationar=\r\ny darshan. Today it is tandava darshan [dancing darshan]. Why should there =\r\nbe any worry on that account?=E2=80=9D&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0Then he kept silent. The=\r\n suspicion was that the shivering was caused by an infection brought on by =\r\nthe green leaves. So this treatment was stopped.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Sri Ramana found =\r\nit increasingly difficult to climb the steps of the eastern entrance of the=\r\n New Hall. When it was suggested that he should use the northern entrance, =\r\nwhere the steps were not so high, he refused, as the northern part of the H=\r\nall was the women=E2=80=99s area and he did not want to disturb them by ent=\r\nering there. But from now on, whenever he was not giving darshan, he remain=\r\ned in the small room on the eastern side of the New Hall, which had its own=\r\n bath. This room became known as the =E2=80=98Nirvana room=E2=80=99, as it =\r\nwas here that he died.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;On 19th Ma=\r\nrch, the Telugu New Year, Sri Ramana had a bad accident.When he entered his=\r\n bathroom in the morning, he stumbled over the threshold and fell. A devote=\r\ne wanted to help him up, but he refused and stood up by himself, albeit wit=\r\nh difficulty. His koupina and his towel were covered in blood. He probably =\r\nhad a fracture, but his attendant was not allowed to make it public. The pa=\r\nrt of his body on which he had fallen, started to suppurate and was very pa=\r\ninful, but this too was concealed. That day Ramana sat as usual from 9 a.m.=\r\n onwards on the veranda of the little room to give darshan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;On the night before the 14th April Sri Ramana asked everyone to go to bed =\r\nor to meditate and leave him alone. Even his attendants he sent away. The n=\r\next morning he said in English to his attendant Rangaswami, who had just fi=\r\nnished massaging him, =E2=80=9Cthanks=E2=80=9D. Rangaswami, who knew no Eng=\r\nlish, looked astonished, so Sri Ramana smiled and explained the meaning to =\r\nhim, =E2=80=9CThe English have a word =E2=80=98thanks=E2=80=99, but we only=\r\n say =E2=80=98santosham=E2=80=99 (I am pleased).=E2=80=9D&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Until the last Sri Ramana showed his concern for t=\r\nhe animals.Some hours before his death he asked if the peacocks, whom he he=\r\nard screeching, had had their food. The animals reacted to his approaching =\r\nend. The peacocks walked round his room, the cows,dogs, monkeys, birds, all=\r\n showed their affection in their own way.But the white peacock stood on the=\r\n roof of the Nirvana room screeching uninterruptedly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;On 14=\r\nth April 1950 At 8.47 p.m., without any struggle, his breathing stopped. Th=\r\nere was no other sign of death,only that the next breath did not come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;The French photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson,who had been staying at th=\r\ne Ashram for two weeks, rushed into the Nirvana room shortly after the mome=\r\nnt of the Maharshi=E2=80=99s&lt;br&gt;\n\ndeath and asked those present for the exa=\r\nct minute of his death.He later reported, =E2=80=9CI was in the open space =\r\nin front of my house,when my friends drew my attention to the sky, where I =\r\nsaw a vividly-luminous shooting star with a luminous tail, unlike any shoot=\r\ning star I had before seen, coming from the South, moving slowly across the=\r\n sky and, reaching the top of Arunachala, disappeared behind it. Because of=\r\n its singularity we all guessed its import and immediately looked at our wa=\r\ntches =E2=80=93 it was 8.47 =E2=80=93 and then raced to the Ashram only to =\r\nfind that our premonition had been only&lt;br&gt;\n\ntoo sadly true: the Master had=\r\n passed into mahanirvana at that very minute.=E2=80=9D&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This unusual =\r\nphenomenon was witnessed by large numbers of people over a wide area. On 16=\r\nth April all English and Tamil newspapers published reports on the death of=\r\n the Maharshi and also about the appearance of the shooting star.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\nThe crowd of people was so large that the twenty policemen were barely able=\r\n to keep them under control. Cohen reports that about 40,000 people came du=\r\nring the day to pay their last respects to Sri Ramana.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as the Ma=\r\nharshi spent 54 years of his life in Tiruvannamalai and 28 of them at Raman=\r\nashram,his presence is felt there with special intensity.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It is, n=\r\nevertheless, very important to point out that the true experience of the pr=\r\nesence of Ramana and Arunachala must be in the Heart, it is not bound by ti=\r\nme or place, and everything else has only the limited value of a manifestat=\r\nion. =E2=80=9CWhere could I go? I am here=E2=80=9D means that he is the Hea=\r\nrt of all living beings, the Self, as it states in Chapter X, verse 20 of t=\r\nhe Bhagavad Gita, his favourite verse, =E2=80=9CI am the Self, Oh Gudakesa,=\r\n dwelling in the Heart of every being; I am the beginning, the middle and a=\r\nlso the end of all living beings.=E2=80=9D&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-wei=\r\nght:bold&quot;&gt;Ramana describes Realization of the Self as follows, =E2=80=9CIn =\r\na pinhole camera, when the hole is small, you see shapes and colours. When =\r\nthe hole is made big, the images disappear and one sees only clear light. S=\r\nimilarly when the mind is small and narrow, it is full of shapes and words.=\r\n When it broadens, it sees pure light. When the box is destroyed altogether=\r\n, only the light remains.=E2=80=9D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-=\r\nweight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: Ramana Maharshi: His Life A biography by Gabrie=\r\nle Ebert&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82 =C2=A0=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B1=8B =C2=A0=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =C2=A0=E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=AF =C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D =C2=A0=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B1=81 =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd13a328edfbc04802be7a1--\r\n\n"}}
