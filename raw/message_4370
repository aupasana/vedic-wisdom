Sri Bhagavan showed symptoms of=\r\n\nslight jaundice and was growing weaker and weaker every day avoiding\nmedic=\r\nation. Devotees implored him to have some treatment but without\nsuccess. So=\r\nme of us prayed and a few others were silently doing\ncircumambulation round=\r\n the Hall in which Sri Bhagavan was seated. Major\nChadwick was prominent am=\r\nong those beseeching Sri Bhagavan to take some\nmedicine.\n\nOne day while I w=\r\nas just starting from home to my office in Madras, the\npostman handed me a =\r\nletter. It was from Mr. Chadwick.\n\nThe letter I recollect read like this:\n\n=\r\n=E2=80=9CDear T. P. R. I am sorry to tell you of the declining health of Sr=\r\ni\nBhagavan who is growing weaker day by day, and will do nothing to allevia=\r\nte\nit. He will not take any medicines, or heed our requests and persuasions=\r\n. It\nis misery to be seeing this. Today just a thought came to me. You know=\r\n that\nSri Bhagavan always avoids medicines, but all the same he does not re=\r\nject\nayurvedic preparations like =E2=80=98black halwa=E2=80=99 (lehiyam) wh=\r\nich if offered he may\nbe pleased to accept. So why don=E2=80=99t you go to =\r\nsome ayurvedic expert or\npharmacy and ask for something, mentioning the sym=\r\nptoms and conditions and\nsend it to him (to the Ashram).If it is your good =\r\nkarma he may be pleased to\ntake it. But don=E2=80=99t say I wrote to you or=\r\n expressed concern. You can say that\nby chance you met so and so and found =\r\na lehiyam well prepared which is good\nfor many things and that it is only a=\r\n tonic and not a medicine, etc. I shall\nexpect your immediate response.=E2=\r\n=80=9D\n\nOn reading this letter, I went straight to the Venkataramana Dispen=\r\nsary in\nMylapore before going to court, and meeting the senior physician in=\r\n charge\nthere narrated the symptoms without disclosing the identity of the =\r\nperson\nfor whom it was meant. I requested him to prescribe and give somethi=\r\nng\nhelpful.\n\nI purchased one pound of the lehiyam and went to my office. Re=\r\ntaining a\nsmall part with me, I packed the rest and sent it to Sri\nNiranjan=\r\nanandaswami, the then sarvadhikari, with a lettersaying:\n\n=E2=80=9CDear Sri=\r\n Chinnaswamigal, Today as I was passing through Mylapore I peeped\ninto the =\r\nVenkataramana Dispensary where a fresh lehiyam was being prepared\nand ready=\r\n for sale,\ncalled Jiragavilvadi lehiyam. I felt impelled to buy it and did =\r\nso.It is so\nsweet and good that retaining a portion for me, I have sent the=\r\n rest to you\nwhich I request you may place before Sri Bhagavan as any other=\r\n offering is\ndone. This is not medicine\nbut belongs to the class of tonics =\r\ngenerally taken by all.=E2=80=9D\n\nSri Chinnaswami accordingly appears to ha=\r\nve placed both the parcel and the\nletter before Sri Bhagavan.\n\nI felt elate=\r\nd and happy at the success of Mr. Chadwick=E2=80=99s scheme and sat down\nbe=\r\nfore Sri Bhagavan. Within half a minute Sri Bhagavan asked, =E2=80=9CWhat? =\r\nDid\nanyone write to you to send this?=E2=80=9D I immediately admitted it an=\r\nd said: =E2=80=9CYes\nBhagavan,Chadwick wrote to me all that I have said in =\r\nmy letter, and my\nexpectations and hope also being the same, I did what he =\r\nasked me to do and\nfaithfully wrote to Chinnaswamigal without even\nmentioni=\r\nng his letter as if all this was my own initiative.=E2=80=9D\n\nSri Bhagavan =\r\nlaughed graciously saying, =E2=80=9CSee that, see that!=E2=80=9D\n\nThat even=\r\ning Chadwick entered the hall at 4 p.m. as was his routine,\ninwardly also e=\r\nlated and happy. But hardly did he rise from his obeisance\nwhen Sri Bhagava=\r\nn said: =E2=80=9CChadwick! Did you write anything?=E2=80=9D This was a\nmome=\r\nnt of shock and surprise for Chadwick and he having done all this out of\nhi=\r\ns extreme love and devotion to Sri Bhagavan, happily declared:=E2=80=9CYes\n=\r\nBhagavan, I wrote all that to T. P. R. What can we do? Sri Bhagavan never\nw=\r\nill take anything and it was miserable for us devotees to be witnessing Sri=\r\n\nBhagavan growing weaker day by day. So I did all that and I am happy now.=\r\n=E2=80=9D\n\nHe resumed his seat and began to meditate as usual. Such was Cha=\r\ndwick=E2=80=99s\ndevotion and love to Sri Bhagavan! He was one among the man=\r\ny old devotees\nwhose devotion to him was boundless.\n\nSource: SURPASSING LOV=\r\nE AND GRACE SRI RAMANASRAMAM By His devotees\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=\r\n=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0016368e2b47a0c5920486ed7e12\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;It was some time during the ear=\r\nly forties.
