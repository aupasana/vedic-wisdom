I feel \nthat when we put things out on internet, they should be=\r\n backed up \nwith appropriate reference and should try to stick to our scrip=\r\ntures, \nas there is lot of depth. We can interpret them as per our abilitie=\r\ns \nand state that too.\n\nFor one when information posted on internet, we don=\r\not know when, how \nand who will use the information. This leads to a lot of=\r\n \nbastardization and eventually lead to wrong practices for the wrong \nreas=\r\non. We practice many even today without understanding or if we \nneed.\n\nWhy =\r\ncoin new fancy names and definitions as there may already be \nappropriate n=\r\names and definitions in our scripture.\n\nYou always question Pt Sanjay Rath =\r\nand ask for source parampara or \nhimself or other, I appreciate that.\n\nI ho=\r\npe you take this in a positive way. There a lot of good things \nthat you ha=\r\nve done and are trying to do, please keep it up and as \ntime goes on, you n=\r\need to be more vigilant and careful.\n\nI recommend take some time to get you=\r\nr references straight and then \nshare as that would also improve the qualit=\r\ny greatly. If you donot \nhave time, give pointers to others to research and=\r\n come up. \nCollabrating is always good.\n\nWhy do you want to share something=\r\n and tell please accept it with a \npinch of salt, types of agni, we definat=\r\nely should have definition in \nblack and white.\n\nBest Regards\nMitesh\n\n--- I=\r\nn vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

I know \n&gt; some things because I heard from a person or read in a book an=\r\nd \nhence I can \n&gt; identify the external source of that knowledge. But some =\r\nknowledge \njust \n&gt; comes from inside and I am not really sure of the source=\r\n. This one \nis like \n&gt; that.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, there are no guarantees that w=\r\nhat I know, from outside \nor from \n&gt; within, is correct. So please take wha=\r\nt I write with a pinch of \nsalt.\n&gt; \n&gt; I always remind people that I am not =\r\nmuch of a scholar and merely a \ndumb \n&gt; servant of my guru and Mother.

It symb=\r\nolizes absorbing \nand\n&gt; &gt; digesting experiences. As you make offerings in f=\r\nire and they \nburn in\n&gt; &gt; fire, various spiritual experiences are processed=\r\n and digested by\n&gt; &gt; your internal fire.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Tongue is that which all=\r\nows one to taste things that one is going\n&gt; &gt; to accept inside and digest. =\r\nEach tongue of fire stands for a \nspirit\n&gt; &gt; that controls how you absorb s=\r\npiritual experiences.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The seven ton=\r\ngues of Agni are: Kaali, Karaali, Manojava, \nSulohita,\n&gt; &gt; Sudhoomra-Varna,=\r\n Sphulingini, and Vishwaruchi.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Kaali is the dark and black/blue f=\r\nire. It symbolizes the spirit \nof\n&gt; &gt; detachment. Spirit of detachment cont=\r\nrols how you absorb your\n&gt; &gt; experiences, when you are offering in that ton=\r\ngue of fire.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Karaali is the monstrous, dreadful fire that looks l=\r\nike a wide \nopen\n&gt; &gt; mouth. Spirit of attachment and desire controls how yo=\r\nu absorb \nyour\n&gt; &gt; experiences, when you are offering in that tongue of fir=\r\ne.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Manojava is the swiftly moving, flickering and unstable flame.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Spirit of wavering (could also be flexibility) controls how you\n&gt; &gt; ab=\r\nsorb your experiences, when you are offering in that tongue of \nfire.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sulohita is the (copper like) dark red color flame. Spirit of\n&gt; &gt; dete=\r\nrmination and strength controls how you absorb your \nexperiences,\n&gt; &gt; when =\r\nyou are offering in that tongue of fire.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sudhoomra-Varna is the g=\r\nreyish/purple/smoke-colored fire. Spirit \nof\n&gt; &gt; confusion (could also be r=\r\nesolution of confusion) controls how you\n&gt; &gt; absorb your experiences, when =\r\nyou are offering in that tongue of \nfire.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sphulingini is the fire=\r\n with sparks. Spirit of aggression and \nhaste\n&gt; &gt; (could also be a great in=\r\ntuition/insight) controls how you absorb\n&gt; &gt; your experiences, when you are=\r\n offering in that tongue of fire.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Vishwaruchi is the bright fire.=\r\n Spirit of focus, knowing, being \nand\n&gt; &gt; bliss controls how you absorb you=\r\nr experiences, when you are \noffering\n&gt; &gt; in that tongue of fire.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; As you keep performing homam and a relations=\r\nhip is formed between\n&gt; &gt; you and fire, the external fire in the homa kunda=\r\nm will reflect \nyour\n&gt; &gt; internal fire. When your mind is well-focused and =\r\nblissful, the \nfire\n&gt; &gt; will automatically burn bright.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The state=\r\n of your mind will decide how you will taste the \nspiritual\n&gt; &gt; experiences=\r\n you are going to absorb from around you. That in turn\n&gt; &gt; decides which to=\r\nngues (tasting agents) of your internal fire are\n&gt; &gt; receiving food right n=\r\now. That in turn decides which tongues of \nthe\n&gt; &gt; external fire are receiv=\r\ning offerings right now.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The external fire is a mirror to your in=\r\nternal state. An adept \nmay\n&gt; &gt; be able to detect, looking at the fire, whi=\r\nch tongues of fire are\n&gt; &gt; active right now and hence guess the state your =\r\nmind is in.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, trying to pa=\r\ny too much attention to this technicality\n&gt; &gt; and becoming over-conscious o=\r\nf the nature of fire is unneeded. \nThough\n&gt; &gt; external can be used to manip=\r\nulate the internal (within some \nlimits),\n&gt; &gt; it can become a distraction.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Whether internal follows external or external follows internal a\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; invalid question. The reality is that the two change together.\n&gt; &gt; Neit=\r\nher is the cause and neither is the effect. They just happen\n&gt; &gt; together.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Without thinkiing much, just make offerings in the fire with the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; *firm belief* that god is in fire. The rest will happen\n&gt; &gt; automatical=\r\nly. It may take time, but it will happen by itself.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------\n-\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.or=\r\ng/homam\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: \nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/ta=\r\nrpana\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Fr=\r\nee Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyot=\r\nish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath C=\r\nentre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ---------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------\n- \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ----- Original Me=\r\nssage ----- \n&gt; &gt;&gt; From: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@y=\r\nahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sent: Wednesday, February 11, 2009 8:13 AM\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Subjec=\r\nt: [vedic-wisdom] Agni\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; What do the seven =\r\n&quot;tongues&quot; of Agni mean?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
