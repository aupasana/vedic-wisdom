Then why should we not=\r\n\ncommit all sorts of sins?\n\nA: It is true we are not bound and that the rea=\r\nl Self has no bondage. It is\ntrue that you will eventually go back to your =\r\nsource. But meanwhile, if you\ncommit sins, as you call them, you will have =\r\nto face the consequences of\nsuch sins. You cannot escape them. If a man bea=\r\nts you, then, can you say, `I\nam free, I am not bound by these beatings and=\r\n I don&#39;t feel any pain. Let him\nbeat on&#39;? If you can feel like that, you ca=\r\nn go on doing what you like. What\nis the use of merely saying with your lip=\r\ns &#39;I am free&#39;?\n\nQ: It is said that the whole universe is God&#39;s play of cons=\r\nciousness and\nthat everything is full of Brahman. Then why should we say th=\r\nat bad habits\nand bad practices should be discarded?\n\nA: Suppose there is s=\r\nome wound inside the human body. If you neglect it, on\nthe assumption that =\r\nit is only a small part of the body, it causes pain to\nthe whole body. If i=\r\nt is not cured by ordinary treatment, the doctor must\ncome, cut off the aff=\r\nected portion with a knife and remove the impurities.\nIf the diseased part =\r\nis not cut off it will fester. If you do not bandage it\nafter operating, pu=\r\ns will form. It is the same thing with regard to\nconduct. Bad habits and ba=\r\nd conduct are like a wound in the body. Every\ndisease must be given appropr=\r\niate treatment.\n\nSource: Be as you are =E2=80=93 The teachings of Sri Raman=\r\na Maharishi By David\nGodman\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=\r\n=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0016e64711a0c80728048c6bba26\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nQ: Sankara says we are all free, not bound, and that we shall al=\r\nl go back to God from whom we have come as sparks from a fire.
