Even great jnaanis are \n&gt;=\r\n occasionally deluded by Her power. One can understand unmanifested non-dua=\r\nl \n&gt; Brahman, but one cannot hope to understand the dual world fully ever. =\r\nShe is \n&gt; capable of deluding even the greatest sadhaka with a wrong idea a=\r\ns soon as \n&gt; one ventures into duality. She can mislead *anyone* on *anythi=\r\nng*. What She \n&gt; does and why She does that is so difficult to fathom. The =\r\nonly way to deal \n&gt; with Her is to surrender to Her power *fully*.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; o=\r\nn the other hand we are all a part of Divinity\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW, though we are all =\r\npart of the same Divinity, we are all not the same. \n&gt; In the non-dual fiel=\r\nd, we are all the same. But, in the field of duality, we \n&gt; have difference=\r\ns due to previous vasanas (conditioning) , which decide what \n&gt; and how muc=\r\nh we can do within the dual world. When a being like Krishna is \n&gt; born wit=\r\nh 16 kalas, He can do *anything* with the objects of the dual world. \n&gt; Whe=\r\nn a being like Sai Baba is born with 2 or 3 kalas, He can do a lot of \n&gt; th=\r\nings in the dual world that are impossible for others.\n&gt; \n&gt; Realizing the n=\r\non-dual Self is something that is possible for anyone, but \n&gt; there are lim=\r\nits imposed on what things one can do in the dual world, based \n&gt; on the fo=\r\nrce of previous conditioning. Thus, all are the same at one \n&gt; (non-dual) l=\r\nevel and all are different at another (dual) level.\n&gt; \n&gt; But it is tough to=\r\n know for sure what one&#39;s caliber is. Thus, your basic \n&gt; point holds. But =\r\nI just wanted to point that all are not indeed the same. We \n&gt; should be di=\r\nsinterested in knowing who is what, not because all are the \n&gt; same, but be=\r\ncause we have no surefire way to know who is what.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Nar=\r\nasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---=\r\n------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n=\r\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; Sp=\r\nirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish le=\r\nssons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (=\r\nWindows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) webs=\r\nite: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; Fro=\r\nm: &quot;Dinesh Nambisan&quot; &lt;dinesh@nambisan. net&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroup=\r\ns. com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, November 10, 2008 7:54 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom]=\r\n Re: Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive today\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; || Om Lokaah Samastaah S=\r\nukhino Bhavantuh ||\n&gt; \n&gt; Does it matter at all who is whose reincarnation? =\r\nAnd anyway, how will\n&gt; you distinguish when *those* very folks have gone be=\r\nyond the meaning\n&gt; of &quot;I&quot;?

Yes he may have guided m=\r\nany\n&gt; &gt; spiritual aspirants, but there has to be something more unique.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n 2) Did he realize the ultimate? i.e. he keeps mentioning in the book\n&gt; &gt; a=\r\nbout it in many places?

One Mr. Ramanbhai Pate=\r\nl, (we will call him as Mr. Patel)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was working as Operator. He was =\r\na staunch devotee of=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 shri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenev=\r\ner I was meeting him he was always talking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur.=\r\n We came close day by day. There was a weekly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gathering at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hi=\r\ns home called SATSANGA. He was singing devotional songs created\n&gt; &gt; &gt; by\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him and was weeping while singing. He was reading Ramkrishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nKathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending this weekly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; meeting=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of 30\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then. We were used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after duty hours=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and were talking only about Thakur.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One day when we were=\r\n at sea shore he suddenly told me--\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=A2?oRawalbhai,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some g=\r\nuest have come to my home and my wife is remembering me. My\n&gt; &gt; &gt; son\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; will come in a few minutes to call me. I shall have to go now=C3=A2?=EF=\r\n=BF=BD. -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And with my surprise his 8 years old son came to =\r\ncall him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At one another incident he told me that there will be a=\r\n plane\n&gt; &gt; &gt; crash\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tomorrow and that also happened. I was very much=\r\n impressed about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He could foresee the events. One day I =\r\nhad to go to Dwarka by Bus,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; told me not to go through bus,=\r\n as bus tire will be punctured. Yet I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; went to Bus station but bus d=\r\nid not come from Dwarka as was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; punctured\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the way. This was=\r\n surprising.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This all incidents made me to believe that he had so=\r\nme super\n&gt; &gt; &gt; power\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only=\r\n. I was attracted to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also =\r\nbe disciple of shri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 =\r\npm I surrendered\n&gt; &gt; &gt; myself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to Thakur at Mr. Patel=C3=A2?Ts house=\r\n before Thakur picture. I prayed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deeply from my heart to =\r\naccept me as his follower and bestow his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; grace.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Next day mo=\r\nrning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 morning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; while taking =\r\nthe tea.

Eve=\r\nn great jnaanis are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; occasionally deluded by Her power. One can und=\r\nerstand unmanifested non-dual &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Brahman, but one cannot hope to unde=\r\nrstand the dual world fully ever. She is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; capable of deluding even =\r\nthe greatest sadhaka with a wrong idea as soon as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; one ventures int=\r\no duality. She can mislead *anyone* on *anything*. What She &lt;BR&gt;&gt; does a=\r\nnd why She does that is so difficult to fathom. The only way to deal &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; with Her is to surrender to Her power *fully*.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; on =\r\nthe other hand we are all a part of Divinity&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; BTW, though w=\r\ne are all part of the same Divinity, we are all not the same. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In t=\r\nhe non-dual field, we are all the same.\n But, in the field of duality, we &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; have differences due to previous vasanas (conditioning) , which dec=\r\nide what &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and how much we can do within the dual world. When a bein=\r\ng like Krishna is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; born with 16 kalas, He can do *anything* with th=\r\ne objects of the dual world. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When a being like Sai Baba is born wi=\r\nth 2 or 3 kalas, He can do a lot of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; things in the dual world that =\r\nare impossible for others.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Realizing the non-dual Self is =\r\nsomething that is possible for anyone, but &lt;BR&gt;&gt; there are limits impose=\r\nd on what things one can do in the dual world, based &lt;BR&gt;&gt; on the force =\r\nof previous conditioning. Thus, all are the same at one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (non-dual)=\r\n level and all are different at another (dual) level.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; But =\r\nit is tough to know for sure what one&#39;s caliber is. Thus, your basic &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; point holds. But I just wanted to point that all are not indeed the same=\r\n. We &lt;BR&gt;&gt; should be\n disinterested in knowing who is what, not because =\r\nall are the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; same, but because we have no surefire way to know who =\r\nis what.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do =\r\na Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do P=\r\nitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sp=\r\nirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyot=\r\nish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotis=\r\nh software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath=\r\n Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n ----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Dinesh Nambisan&quot; &lt;dinesh@n=\r\nambisan. net&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Sent: Monday,\n November 10, 2008 7:54 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] R=\r\ne: Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive today&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; || Om Lo=\r\nkaah Samastaah Sukhino Bhavantuh ||&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Does it matter at all =\r\nwho is whose reincarnation?

Sri Yogeshwar was a very highly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; real=\r\nized saint. His book is very good. He does mention about his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; p=\r\nrevoius birth and also mentions that Saccha Baba had also confirmed&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; the same thing. Saccha Baba was another very highly realized saint to=\r\no.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sri Yogeshwar had many times visions of Sai Ba=\r\nba of shirdi and Naamdev&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and also many other saints too.

This inner guru is the =\r\nsame in all humam beings but&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; manifests uniquely based on each =\r\nperson.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I also believe that one needs to get\n ini=\r\ntiated by a Guru who is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; present in physical form and seek guid=\r\nance from him time to time.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; There are many instances of other =\r\nforms of inititations like&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; initiation in dream or inititation =\r\nby cosmic forms, these forms of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; initiations though very import=\r\nant are very rare or uncommon.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; After=\r\n reading Sri Yogeshwar&#39;s book I had some questions pop up in my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; mind about him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 1) What was the purpose of his =\r\nbirth? Yes he may have guided many&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; spiritual aspirants, but th=\r\nere has to be something more unique.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 2) Did he realize the ult=\r\nimate? i.e. he keeps mentioning in the book&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; about it in many p=\r\nlaces? Was he satisfied? How did he feel after that?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 3) He did=\r\n pass away abruptly in bombay while in the middle of giving&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sp=\r\nirtual talks? It seems unusual.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I have\n also read=\r\n somewhere that once a person reaches a spiritual&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; state, he ca=\r\nnnot remain in human body for more than few days, was this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the=\r\n case?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; May be others who have read this book can =\r\nshare more light.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I do recommend to seekers of spirutuality to=\r\n read this book if one has&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; time, it is available for free to d=\r\nownload as a pdf book on his web&lt;BR&gt;&gt; site.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sr=\r\ni Ram Sharma also has done a lot of work for the betterment and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; upliftment, a lot of his information is wellknown.

One Mr. Ramanbh=\r\nai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was workin=\r\ng as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 shri&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was always tal=\r\nking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n about&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. We came c=\r\nlose day by day. There was a weekly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; gathering at&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his home called SATSANGA. He was singing devotional songs cr=\r\neated&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; by&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him and was weeping while=\r\n singing. He was reading Ramkrishna&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kathamrita. We 1=\r\n0 to 12 youngsters were attending this weekly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; meeting&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Patel=\r\n was of 30&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then. We were used to go to seashore dail=\r\ny at 7 pm after duty hours&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and were talking only abo=\r\nut Thakur.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One day when we were at sea shore he=\r\n suddenly told me--&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=A2?oRawalbhai,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; some guest have come to my home and my wife is remembering me. My&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; son&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will come in a few minutes to call=\r\n me. I shall have to\n go now=C3=A2?=EF=BF=BD. -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; -&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; And with my surprise his 8 years old son came to call him.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At one another incident he told me that there w=\r\nill be a plane&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; crash&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tomorrow and =\r\nthat also happened. I was very much impressed about&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; him.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He could foresee the events. One day I had to go to =\r\nDwarka by Bus,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; told me not to g=\r\no through bus, as bus tire will be punctured. Yet I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nwent to Bus station but bus did not come from Dwarka as was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; punctured&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the way. This was surprising.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This all incidents made me to believe that he had som=\r\ne super&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; power&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and this was due to =\r\nRamkrishandev worship only. I was attracted to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shri =\r\nThakur. One day I\n thought, I should also be disciple of shri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; myself&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to Thakur at Mr. Patel=C3=A2=\r\n?Ts house before Thakur picture. I prayed&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; him&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; deeply from my heart to accept me as his follower and bestow hi=\r\ns&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; grace.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Next day morning I h=\r\nad a discussion with my wife at 6.10 morning&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; while t=\r\naking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; wa=\r\nking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in the mo=\r\nrning that I have&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my =\r\nGurudev. My wife was annoyed and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; she&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; argued with me a lot. =C3=A2?&quot;=C3=A2?oWhy should you take such a hasty&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; decision?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was=\r\n a devotee of Maa Kali\n at Calcutta. He&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; was a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; great Saint but our Guru should be living one, who can guide us=\r\n,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; give&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; us Mantra etc. etc. Better =\r\nyou take Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Acharya&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; since you are doing Gayatri Mantra=C3=A2?=EF=BF=BD--.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Her arguments were right at her place as people in general =\r\nnot&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; know&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much about Thakur and I w=\r\nas confused. I thought-- yes I have taken&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hasty deci=\r\nsion. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; B=\r\nut I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was telling&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; their disciples to test him before accepting him. I also decid=\r\ned to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test Thakur. I immediately told my wife that =\r\n=C3=A2?&quot;=C3=A2?oSee, Mr. Patel&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; has&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n never come to our home. You have\n also not seen him. He has never&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; asked&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me where I am living. Suppose Mr. Pa=\r\ntel is coming to our house&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; within&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n10 to 15 minutes, would you believe that my selection for Thakur is&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; perfect?=C3=A2?=EF=BF=BD--&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She =\r\nlaughed at me=C3=A2?&quot;=C3=A2?oHow it is possible? I don=C3=A2?Tt believe.=C3=\r\n=A2?=EF=BF=BD-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I prayed Shr=\r\ni Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediately to justify my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n decision and convince my wife. =C3=A2?~I want to test your existence&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; even&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; today.=C3=A2?T&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; To our great surprise, Mr. Patel was at my home at 06.30 in the&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; morning with angry mood. What he told?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; =C3=A2?~ How dare you test Thakur this way? Do you know what h=\r\nappened?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yesterday was my night duty and I had\n just=\r\n come to my home at 05.30&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mornings today and tried t=\r\no sleep for 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly Thakur&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pulled my =\r\nblanket and told me that-=C3=A2?o Go to your friend=C3=A2?Ts&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; house. He&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is waiting for you. He wants to test m=\r\ne. I will show you his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; house=C3=A2?=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; I immediately rushed to your home. Thakur was guiding me th=\r\ne way&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your house and pushing me=\r\n too. What you want? Why you are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; disturbing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; him in such an early morning for such a silly things?=C3=A2?T&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We both were so excited and surprised that we had =\r\nno words that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Morning.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\n will never forget that 5th April, a miracle day in my life.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; There&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were some more Devine experiences about Sh=\r\nri Thakur\n but I will&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; write&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it som=\r\netime.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sir, and forum members, Ramkrishand=\r\nev is still alive on the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; earth.
