I am obviously talking =\r\nabout &quot;Initiation&quot; and he has really given an answer to this greatly confus=\r\ning phenomina. I am reproducing this again below. for me i am completely sa=\r\ntisfied with simple but very effective defination. i would draw attention o=\r\nf members to following paragraph again:\n\n[\n(3) If you want to do Chandipath=\r\n or any mantra or any ritual or any homam, do it with the attitude of &quot;I ha=\r\nve several material desires, but I do not know how to fulfil them. Because =\r\nof this ritual, god may give any material results or spiritual results and =\r\nnot necessarily fulfil my desires. I will accept whatever god gives. I want=\r\n to increase my devotion and surrender and make spiritual progress&quot;. You ar=\r\ne then SAFE. Initiation is not required. That attitude itself is an initiat=\r\nion!\n]\n\nSo Its a time to say Happy Vijaya Dashami in true sense! I know he&#39;=\r\nll not like my post but what can I do? I like him as i like Thakur and Sach=\r\nin Tendulkar :)\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Happy Vijaya=\r\n Dasami!\n&gt;  \n&gt; (1) I do not share Dr Choudhary&#39;s opinion about reading Engl=\r\nish translation instead of Sanskrit verses if one is not initiated.\n&gt;  \n&gt; (=\r\n2) Initiation serves two purposes:\n&gt;  \n&gt; (2a) As in the analogy I gave earl=\r\nier, a rich father may open a bank account in a son&#39;s name with a starting =\r\nbalance of one million dollars. Similarly, a guru with some achievement in =\r\na mantra can transfer some of it to a disciple. However, one without a rich=\r\n father is still better off opening a bank account with a zero balance and =\r\nbuilding it up slowly with one&#39;s own hard work. Similarly, one not finding =\r\na guru can still do sadhana with famous mantras and build one&#39;s own spiritu=\r\nal account. If you find a guru to initiate you (not as a formality, but tru=\r\nly initiate you), get initiated. Otherwise, just go ahead and do it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n(2b) Mantras and rituals are used for two purposes - (i) for getting specif=\r\nic material results and (ii) as tools of increasing surrender and making sp=\r\niritual progress. In the case of (ii), initiation is not that important. Bu=\r\nt, in the case of (i), there are pitfalls and a guru can prepare one suffic=\r\niently. One can get in trouble otherwise.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, as I said several =\r\ntimes, there are very few people who can do (i) now-a-days. Nature has dest=\r\nabilized the whole system, for a reason, as Kali progressed. I suggest doin=\r\ng mantras and rituals only for increasing surrender, getting whatever mater=\r\nial results god wants to give and making spiritual progress. If one is mean=\r\nt to do rituals for begetting *specific* material results (for oneself or o=\r\nthers or society/universe in general), Nature will make arrangements for on=\r\ne to get correct knowledge of such rituals. But, as one starts, one should =\r\nstart with the attitude of (ii).\n&gt;  \n&gt; (3) If you want to do Chandipath or =\r\nany mantra or any ritual or any homam, do it  with the attitude of &quot;I have =\r\nseveral material desires, but I do not know how to fulfil them. Because of =\r\nthis ritual, god may give any material results or spiritual results and not=\r\n necessarily fulfil my desires. I will accept whatever god gives. I want to=\r\n increase my devotion and surrender and make spiritual progress&quot;. You are t=\r\nhen SAFE. Initiation is not required. That attitude itself is an initiation=\r\n!\n&gt;  \n&gt; (4) Gentle deities give good results slowly, but there are fewer hi=\r\nccups. Fierce deities give results fast, but there may be some hiccups. I g=\r\nave this analogy earlier also. Imagine that a person is taking rotten fruit=\r\ns from a fruit basket and throwing them in garbage and trying to retrieve o=\r\nne good fruit from under them. If the person is gentle, one may do it gentl=\r\ny and the spillage of rotten fruits on the floor will be minimal. If the pe=\r\nrson is aggressive, one may do it fast and there may be more spillage of ro=\r\ntten fruits on the floor. But the good fruit stuck under the rotten fruits =\r\nwill be retrieved faster. Similarly, phala of your karmas is in a basket. T=\r\nhe deity is trying to take bad fruits and throw them in garbage and give yo=\r\nu a good fruit to eat. There may be some spillage. A gentle deity like Gana=\r\npathi, Vishnu or Lakshmi may take more time to get out the good fruit, but =\r\nthe spillage will be minimal. A fierce deity like Chandi or Bhairava or Kal=\r\ni or Narasimha may have more spillage, but the good fruit comes out faster.=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; At the end, remember that these fruits are not deity&#39;s creations, bu=\r\nt fruits of your own actions. Without sadhana, you would&#39;ve had to eat each=\r\n of those rotten fruits before eating the good fruits!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Nevertheless, =\r\none unable to take some of the spillage of rotten fruits is better off avoi=\r\nding fierce deities such as Chandi and staying with gentler deities. If ini=\r\ntiation if made mandatory, one can be assessed by a guru before starting a =\r\npractice. If you realize the above, you can start mantras without initiatio=\r\nn. If some bad results occut, you have to realize that it is a fruit of you=\r\nr own actions and the deity is trying to accelerate good results. If you ar=\r\ne weak-hearted, stick to gentler deities.\n&gt;  \n&gt; (5) Some people who never l=\r\nit a lamp in their life and were ignorant of rituals, are doing daily homam=\r\n now. Some people who took several hours to read Saptashati for the first t=\r\nime just 2-3 years back are now doing Chandi homam with entire saptashati e=\r\nveryday. I know that some of them have transformed a lot and have experienc=\r\ned some things too. Obviously, they have done sadhana with fire and sadhana=\r\n of the Fierce aspects of Divine Mother in some past lives.\n&gt;  \n&gt; (6) In th=\r\nis age of ignorance and rank materialism, if someone has even a faint idea =\r\nthat spiritual progress is important, is looking for god and is attracted t=\r\no a specific advanced sadhana (e.g. Chandipath), that person obviously has =\r\nsome good karmas and good vasanas. That person has done that sadhana in the=\r\n past. Previous life&#39;s sadhana itself is one&#39;s adhikara.\n&gt;  \n&gt; (7) If you h=\r\nave a good understanding of what is what, how things work, why one should d=\r\no something, how to do it, what is more important and what is less importan=\r\nt, that is what initiation is all about!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;   Free=\r\n Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yoursel=\r\nf&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      Films that make a difference: http://Sa=\r\nraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-w=\r\nisdom\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; It is my personal opinion that Strong and long standing urge should be=\r\n considered as Initiation at least in this age.\n&gt; &gt; I know a person who wan=\r\nted to recite Chandi paatha regularly but was not able to almost for a year=\r\n.
