Especially the one\nwhich is modeled in the form of a bear,=\r\n and claps its hands as soon as\nit is powered on. Its hands hold two plates=\r\n which strike each other ,\nthe bear&#39;s eyes light up as soon as the battery =\r\nis put in, and boom, we\nare ready to go.\n\nStudent : Yes, yes, I have seen t=\r\nhose. There are other types also, like\nwhen you put batteries in a car mode=\r\nl, it suddenly starts operating, and\ngoing bonkers, or the teddy bear one, =\r\nwhich starts repeating some cuddly\nlines. It is loved by girls.\n\nTeacher : =\r\nYes, exactly. You, right now, are the teddy bear, which girls\nand everybody=\r\n loves.\n\nStudent : =E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6. the fuck?\n\nTeacher=\r\n : aww!! How cute , my little child is thinking in terms of\nprofanities. Do=\r\n you know why you are here?\n\nStudent : *thinks in mind about all the philos=\r\nophical stuff he has read,\nand knew this question was widely discussed and =\r\nasked, and thus becomes\nhappy&quot;=E2=80=A6. why?\n\nTeacher : Because , somebody=\r\n fucked somebody, LOL. But anyways, leave\nthis fucking business aside for a=\r\n moment. Lets go back to the\ndiscussion, the end of which will be very fun.=\r\n\n\nStudent: we were on the topic that I am a teddy bear.\n\nTeacher : Don&#39;t tw=\r\nist my words, I said right now you are akin to a teddy\nbear. You have been =\r\nthat car, the helicopter , the teddy, the bear who\nclaps, basically all the=\r\n battery powered toys earlier. In philosophical\nterms they are called &quot;birt=\r\nhs&quot;.\n\nStudent : How may I ask?\n\nTeacher : What is your name?\n\nStudent : Cha=\r\nman Sharma ( name changed due to security & other humorous\nreasons)\n\nTeache=\r\nr : LOL @ name. Anyways, think of chaman sharma\nas the bear (the battery po=\r\nwered toy) who claps and claps and claps,\nthat &quot;I am Chaman Sharma, I am a =\r\nmale, I own a house, I am 20 years old\n, i like this girl, I love playing s=\r\nports, I live here, I read this, I\nhate that, I this, and I that&quot;, okay?\n\nS=\r\ntudent : Go on.. * feeling a bit ridiculous about himself*\n\nTeacher : So wh=\r\nen Chaman dies, which is going to happen sooner than\nlater, do you know wha=\r\nt happens or what that means?\n\nStudent : I die, but in reality &quot;I&quot; don&#39;t di=\r\ne.\n\nTeacher : Very good, you have read that off of a book, ever realized it=\r\n?\nAre you not afraid of death?\n\nStudent : No, I am not afraid of death.\n\nTh=\r\ne lights turn off in the room, there is total darkness, for 5 minutes\nthere=\r\n is no noise, but Chaman gets terrified, and then a pair of deep\nred eyes a=\r\nppear in the dark, and in the most ghastly voice ever asks Mr\nChaman, &quot;why =\r\nare you so afraid? the basis of all fear is death, and only\nthe lights have=\r\n gone out, I haven&#39;t even started with you yet, if you\nsay you are not goin=\r\ng to die, then why so scared?&quot;\n\nSuddenly the lights turn back on, the teach=\r\ner is laughing his ass off,\nwith Chaman shivering.\n\nTeacher : You said you =\r\nwere not afraid.\n\nStudent : I never meant it, like that.\n\nTeacher : Then in=\r\n what way did you mean it? Take it as a lesson that\npractical stuff in this=\r\n spirituality business is far greater than all\nyour books combined. You get=\r\n lost while reading, you think you are\ndifferent. To me you are no worse th=\r\nan the thousand others I meet,\nin-fact they are better off without the text=\r\ns you have studied.\n\nStudent : Agreed, but don&#39;t scare me like that. Again.=\r\n\n\nTeacher : I will, if you make such ridiculous claims again. Anyways,\nwher=\r\ne were we? The death of the teddy bear. Yes. But mind you the teddy\nremains=\r\n, the outer shell remains, but teddy is dead. The outer shell is\neither bur=\r\nied or burnt, in essence done away with, because it is of no\nuse. Right?\n\nS=\r\ntudent : Right\n\nTeacher : Wrong. Lets get back to the toy. Consider this, w=\r\nhen you\nremove the battery from the toy, what happens? The toy is literally=\r\n\nuseless, it can&#39;t clap, it can&#39;t shout, it can&#39;t cry, it can&#39;t do shit.\nTh=\r\nus, at death, Mr Chaman, you are removed from Mr Chaman&#39;s body. You\nnever d=\r\nie, you are only the battery powering this personality which\nleads to power=\r\ning your body.\n\nStudent: How can you even=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6\n\nTeacher : Lets=\r\n consider that you are two batteries, two aa sized ones.\nWhen you plug the =\r\nbatteries into a car, suddenly the car comes to life,\nwithout the battery t=\r\nhe car is idle, but as soon as I put the battery\nin, the car goes=E2=80=A6=\r\n=E2=80=A6.. beep beep honk honk, move, I am a car.\n\nStudent : sits in silen=\r\nce knowing well that interrupting now will be the\nbiggest mistake ever.\n\nTe=\r\nacher :And when I take the same batteries out of a car and put it into\nlets=\r\n say a teddy bear, the teddy bear comes alive, start to sing a song,\nor act=\r\ns mushy. And when I pull the battery out?\n\nStudent : Teddy is idle, literal=\r\nly useless.\n\nTeacher : Yes, but go deeper. It was the same battery that pow=\r\nered the\ncar, it was the same battery that powered the teddy bear, and it i=\r\ns the\nsame battery that can power any toy, correct?\n\nStudent : Correct\n\nTea=\r\ncher : While the battery is in the car, it believes itself to be the\ncar. I=\r\nt believes &quot;yesssss, i am a car, red colour, 198 bhp, 70 mm\ntorque, top spe=\r\ned 320kmph, 4 wheels, engine at the back, hot woman in my\npassengers seat, =\r\nI am the king baby, look at how hot I am&quot;\n\nStudent: Oh dear god=E2=80=A6.\n\n=\r\nTeacher : Then I take out the battery from the car. And PHAT it is a\nuseles=\r\ns piece of metal. And I plug the battery into a teddy, suddenly it\nbelieves=\r\n itself to be the teddy, it goes &quot; yeeeeessssss, I am the teddy,\nI am mushy=\r\n, I am soft, everybody adores me, look how cuddly I am, I can\neven clap my =\r\nhands &quot;, and when I take the battery out, PHAT, the teddy\nis=E2=80=A6..\n\nSt=\r\nudent : Useless, and dead.\n\nTeacher : Thats a useless conclusion, it is kno=\r\nwn by the world, not\nrealized. Every tom dick and harry knows that, Lets go=\r\n deeper. The point\nis the battery confuses itself to be the teddy or the go=\r\nd damn car.\n\nStudent : So the battery is the soul?\n\nTeacher : *smacks on th=\r\ne student&#39;s head* Who said that?\n\nStudent : You did.\n\nTeacher : *another ph=\r\natek on the head of the student* When did I say?\nYou read it in one of your=\r\n fancy articles and commentaries and satsangs\nthat people do, genius, and y=\r\nou read it all too wrong, you read it and\nthus think you &#39;know&#39;, you never =\r\npracticed, fools you people are. Most\nof the time you people are fed bullsh=\r\nit and you gobble it up like pigs\nin mud. That reminds me we haven&#39;t had a =\r\npepperoni  pizza in a long\ntime, lets order one. LOL\n\nStudent : Sorry=E2=80=\r\n=A6\n\nTeacher : Don&#39;t be, you are my child, I love you. Anyways , back to ou=\r\nr\ndiscussion on toys. The confusion of the battery. And thus Chaman, you\nco=\r\nnfuse yourself to be Chaman. This is the 67432th time , you have been\nplugg=\r\ned into a a toy (read body) and the confusion prevails. Focus on\nthe &quot;confu=\r\nsion&quot; aspect.\n\nStudent : Then who am I?\n\nTeacher : You are the ever lasting=\r\n consciousness, the universal bliss,\nthe infinite, the ever pervading light=\r\n of the universe!!! Breathe in and\nout and feel the bliss!!\n\nStudent : Yess=\r\n!!! this is what I read, * breathes in and out deeply*\n*Smells huge amounts=\r\n of odor*=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6 What is that smell?\n\nTeacher : I just farted, f=\r\neels so blissful, did you feel your bliss too?\n\nStudent : Ewwwww=E2=80=A6.\n=\r\n\nTeacher : Bhutni ke, do you think we guys are fools who have spent lives\ni=\r\nn search of who we are, and you will know just by breathing in and out,\nand=\r\n thinking you are the ever lasting consciousness and all that???\nBefkuf!! C=\r\nhaman kahin ka!!\n\nStudent : But you only said that  &quot;You are the ever lasti=\r\nng\nconsciousness, the universal bliss, the infinite, the ever pervading\nlig=\r\nht of the universe!!! Breathe in and out and feel the bliss!!&quot;\n\nTeacher : I=\r\nt is called a test, and needless to say you have scored a\ncompartment.\n\nStu=\r\ndent : Hey ram=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6.\n\nTeacher : So back to who you ar=\r\ne, you are just like the battery who is\nthe source of that body and the per=\r\nsonality and confuses itself to be &quot;\nI am Chaman Sharma, age 20, resident o=\r\nf vasant vihar, have a girlfriend,\nam a male, love to party, own a mercedez=\r\n, worship a a little, interested\nin god and whatever &quot;\n\nStudent : So who am=\r\n I?\n\nTeacher : You are duracell=E2=80=A6..How do they write post a mathemat=\r\nics\nsolution=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6Q.E.D or hence proved. QED =3D  quit=\r\ne easily done.\n\nStudent : Thats one more self identification of being durac=\r\nell\n\nTeacher : Brilliant!!!!!! Now you are talking.\n\nStudent: *Feels quite =\r\nproud*\n\nTeacher : And THAT is one more self identification.\n\nStudent : Hey =\r\nRam!!\n\nTeacher : Ram Ram.\n\nStudent : So I theoretically understand it , but=\r\n how do I actually\nrealize it?\n\nTeacher : You do Sadhana.\n\nStudent : Sittin=\r\ng in a yogic pose and focusing on the lotus and all?\n\nTeacher : I will fuck=\r\ning beat you to your death if you repeat this\nbullshit ever again.\n\nStudent=\r\n: Sorry=E2=80=A6\n\nTeacher : No need to be. That is what is meant by Sadhana=\r\n to most\npeople. But does anyone know what is Sadhana?\n\nStudent : You shed =\r\nsome light on it?\n\nTeacher: What do you think I am a bulb? LOL, Anyways, al=\r\nl sadhana is\nbasically in essence, and mark these all important words.\n&quot; YO=\r\nU trying to convince yourself that &quot;you&quot; are not YOU &quot;\n\nBirths are spent on=\r\n this my boy, births not lives, it takes a lot of\neffort to tell and convin=\r\nce yourself that you are just not you.\n\nStudent : and how do you do that?\n\n=\r\nTeacher : By sadhana aka mostly known as repeating a mantra. You\neventually=\r\n yourself become the form of the mantra that you chant, thus\nrealizing the =\r\ndeity( the big daddy battery)/ the specific form of the\none (the source of =\r\nall the Big and small batteries). A mantra means man\nki tarana, does it not=\r\n?\n\nStudent : So by sadhana , I will realize that I am the battery and not\nt=\r\nhis personality?\n\nTeacher : Yes, but the day &quot;you&quot; realize, &quot;you&quot; will go d=\r\nead, to\nyourself.\n\nStudent: I am beginning to understand a little, can you =\r\nexplain where\ndoes a deity stand in this whole battery concept?\n\nTeacher : =\r\nIf you are the battery, the battery has to have a source, you\nare not svaya=\r\nmbhu that you exist on you own. The deity is like a huge\npower station in y=\r\nour comparison. It is almost infinite, but since it is\na power station it i=\r\ns bound to have a boundary somewhere, but to you, aa\nsized battery it is en=\r\ndless. Chaman&#39;s source is his parents, but\nchaman&#39;s actual source&#39;s (batter=\r\ny) parent is the power station.\n\nStudent : Hmmm=E2=80=A6.. that&#39;s why she i=\r\ns worshipped as ma?\n\nTeacher : Yes. Who is a Siddha?? A guy or a girl who h=\r\nas realized that\nhe/she himself is the battery and then went on to become o=\r\nne with a\npower station and thus sees himself/herself in everything because=\r\n the\npower station is the source of everything , of all batteries. And sinc=\r\ne\nhe/she actually knows that all elements too are currents and everything\ne=\r\nlse too, he/she actually sees it as that. And thus, the &quot;miracles&quot;. Let\nsay=\r\n I fully well don&#39;t see a difference between me and this table, thus\nI am t=\r\nhis table, thus If i wish to make it fly, I can do it, because I\nam actuall=\r\ny it. To you it is a table, to me it is just a current, who is\njust &quot;me&quot;.\n\n=\r\nStudent: Oooohhhhhhhh=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6.\n\nTeacher : He maybe sai baba to yo=\r\nu, but thats how your eyes perceive him\nto be as, an old man with frail clo=\r\nthing, belongs to shirdi etc etc, but\ninside he is far beyond what you or I=\r\n can comprehend. He first realized\nhe was a battery by doing penance, thus =\r\nkilling himself in the process,\nthe he realized that the battery is as good=\r\n as the power station because\nthe current is the same, so he became one wit=\r\nh that, and then he went\nbeyond and came back to guide as he was chosen, ju=\r\nst like many others\nare, like my great teacher, guru nanak dev, Ramakrishna=\r\n and all\nothers=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6\n\nStudent : And the source of the=\r\n power station is?\n\nTeacher : The one- Satya shri akaal , he/she/it can&#39;t b=\r\ne put into words\nbecause he is infinite and the words are finite. It is pur=\r\nely on\ndefining him religious wars, riots between religions , and intellect=\r\nual\ndiscussions and debates on this thing called internet happen, but\nhe/sh=\r\ne/it is far beyond comprehension. Many people focus on that , and\nget lost,=\r\n but focus on the power station (deity) and it will take you to\nbig daddy.\n=\r\nImagine an endless field of current in comparison of the power station ,\nan=\r\n endless current which exists and all others are a figment of it. The\npower=\r\n stations are a part of it, the current has taken the form of one\nconcentra=\r\nted zone.. But even this contains error of speech, so chuck it.\nThe ultimat=\r\ne is only realized when you are one with the power station so\nlets focus th=\r\nere.\n\nStudent : So the one has taken forms of different power stations to h=\r\nelp\nthe batteries who are spread out to help unite back with it?\n\nTeacher :=\r\n Brilliant.\n\nStudent: So all our lives we debate/fight and cut each other o=\r\nff to\nclaim which power station (deity) is more powerful over the other and=\r\n\nsuperior to all others, when in truth our eyes perceive them(deities) to\nb=\r\ne different, when they are in essence one(Satya shri akaal) and\nlaughing ba=\r\nck at us?\n\nTeacher : ho ho ho=E2=80=A6.. Go on.\n\nStudent : And we try to wo=\r\nrship 10 different ones and always think that\nwe should worship as many to =\r\nget maximum benefit for our mistakingly\nconfused identities of teddy , the =\r\ncar and all other toys?\n\nTeacher : *smokes slowly*=E2=80=A6 I am listening.=\r\n\n\nStudent: So the biggest fools are those who are lost in debates and\npseud=\r\no breathing in and out and raising kundalinis with peacock feathers\nand pun=\r\nches to the spine, reading stuff and debating on concepts which\nthey don&#39;t =\r\nknow a thing about?\n\nTeacher: Yes,Speaking of Kundalini, she is basically y=\r\nou, she is the\nbattery. the stupidest thing in the world is this concept of=\r\n &quot;my\nkundalini&quot;, err=E2=80=A6. you are her you idiot, how is she yours? Any=\r\nways ,\nmany make this error, but it is essential because other wise you can=\r\n&#39;t\nexplain the concept in speech. And if you do fully realize you are her,\n=\r\n&quot;you&quot; will be phat dead in one second. Whenever you are worshipping lets\nsa=\r\ny a form, you in essence , are worshipping yourself, in your full\nglory . W=\r\nhatever you are worshipping is &quot;you&quot;, who is without all the\nlimitations of=\r\n Chaman/teddy/car/toy.\n\nStudent: So then how do realized souls stay in thei=\r\nr bodies post their\nrealization?\n\nTeacher: Intentional identification with =\r\nthe personality by permission\nfrom the power station to fulfill some higher=\r\n purpose of the power\nstation to guide more batteries to realize that they =\r\nare not toys. But\nthey can leave in an instant, because they know realities=\r\n that are much\nhigher than our world.\n\nStudent : So what is moksha?\n\nTeache=\r\nr : It is a concept that is best left alone, if you haven&#39;t merged\nback wit=\r\nh a power station yourself first. You tell me when you have\nmerged back, ho=\r\nw do you know what if feels like to be merged back? You\nyourself have becom=\r\ne one with your source, so &quot;you&quot; don&#39;t remain, even\nthe battery has dissolv=\r\ned, so how do &quot;you&quot; explain it? You wont remember\nit, because you are not t=\r\nhere.\n\nStudent : I can&#39;t explain it.\n\nTeacher : We can&#39;t, It is like explai=\r\nning the color red to a blind man.\nYou will say mars  is red or the red lig=\r\nht is red, he will say I have\nbeen blind from birth I don&#39;t know what you a=\r\nre talking about. You will\nsay tomato, he will say fuck off.\n\nStudent : Yes=\r\n, so It can&#39;t be explained.\n\nTeacher : it can be to an extent, but it is on=\r\ne ridiculously convoluted\ntopic. To add to ti, one toy is a teddy bear, one=\r\n toy is a car, one toy\nis a helicopter, one toy is a turtle, mind you batte=\r\nry is the same, but\nthe car is very different form the toy, thus if you exp=\r\nlain a high level\nconcept to both, both will understand differently and hav=\r\ne a go at it\nwith debates and what not, which leads to more confusion. Bett=\r\ner is both\nrealize it themselves. So you focus on realizing that you are du=\r\nracell\nfirst, mr chaman, everything else comes later. Thus, You are duracel=\r\nl.\nNow time for my reward for my winning the bet. Dance naked on the road.\n=\r\n\nStudent : What?\n\nTeacher : You thought 4 times.\n\nStudent: But I will be di=\r\nsgraced.\n\nTeacher : Nope, Chaman will be, you are duracell, they will laugh=\r\n at\nChaman, who is your 67432nd incarnation, you have done this thousand\nti=\r\nmes before, so what??\n\nStudent : I hate you.\n\nTeacher : I love you too.\n\nSt=\r\nudent : You are serious on this?\n\nTeacher : Very\n\nStudent: : This is why so=\r\nme of the higher ones don&#39;t give a shit about\nroaming naked and doing wild =\r\nstuff, just to keep people away from them.\n\nTeacher : Yes, but a lot of fra=\r\nuds copy and disgrace the higher ones.\n\nStudent : Fine, I will do it. But y=\r\nou will handle my parent&#39;s reaction.\n\nTeacher : Done.\n\nAfter the student di=\r\nd the act, nobody seemed to recall the act the next\nday, yet every one saw =\r\nit that day, and seemed to make faces at the\nstudent for an hour or so. How=\r\n everybody forgot is a different story\naltogether.\n\nDo sadhana, before your=\r\n battery is pulled out, replugged into another\ntoy and yet again, your conf=\r\nusion will prevail driving you to do things\nthat will push you further and =\r\nfurther down.\n\nJai Shree Radheya!!\n\n\n \r\n---724232154-1853471948-1346939767=:93776\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ti=\r\nmes new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;br&gt;Low Battery &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: times new roman, =\r\nnew york, times, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: times=\r\n new roman, new york, times, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;f=\r\nont face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weig=\r\nht:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; scsa_taker3 &lt;scsa_taker3@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b=\r\n&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups=\r\n.com &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Thursday, =\r\n16 August 2012 1:52 AM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;&lt;/b&gt; [vedic-wisdom] You are Duracell&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D=\r\n&quot;yiv1374996181&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1374996181ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div&gt;A =\r\nshort conversation between a student and teacher.&lt;br&gt;\nChant as you read alo=\r\nng.

Especially the one&lt;br&gt;\nwhich is modeled in the form =\r\nof a bear, and claps its hands as soon as&lt;br&gt;\nit is powered on. Its hands h=\r\nold two plates which strike each other ,&lt;br&gt;\nthe bear&#39;s eyes light up as so=\r\non as the battery is put in, and boom, we&lt;br&gt;\nare ready to go.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStu=\r\ndent : Yes, yes, I have seen those. There are other types also, like&lt;br&gt;\nwh=\r\nen you put batteries in a car model, it suddenly starts operating, and&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\ngoing bonkers, or the teddy bear one, which starts repeating some cuddly&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nlines. It is loved by girls.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Yes, exactly. You, right =\r\nnow, are the teddy bear, which girls&lt;br&gt;\nand everybody loves.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStud=\r\nent : =E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6. the fuck?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : aw=\r\nw!! How cute , my little child is thinking in terms of&lt;br&gt;\nprofanities. Do =\r\nyou know why you are here?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : *thinks in mind about all the=\r\n philosophical stuff he has read,&lt;br&gt;\nand knew this question was widely dis=\r\ncussed and asked, and thus becomes&lt;br&gt;\nhappy&quot;=E2=80=A6. why?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeach=\r\ner : Because , somebody fucked somebody, LOL. But anyways, leave&lt;br&gt;\nthis f=\r\nucking business aside for a moment. Lets go back to the&lt;br&gt;\ndiscussion, the=\r\n end of which will be very fun.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent: we were on the topic that=\r\n I am a teddy bear.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Don&#39;t twist my words, I said right n=\r\now you are akin to a teddy&lt;br&gt;\nbear. You have been that car, the helicopter=\r\n , the teddy, the bear who&lt;br&gt;\nclaps, basically all the battery powered toy=\r\ns earlier. In philosophical&lt;br&gt;\nterms they are called &quot;births&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSt=\r\nudent : How may I ask?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : What is your name?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStude=\r\nnt : Chaman Sharma ( name changed due to security &amp; other humorous&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nreasons)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : LOL @ name. Anyways, think of chaman sharma&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nas the bear (the battery powered toy) who claps and claps and claps,&lt;br&gt;\nt=\r\nhat &quot;I am Chaman Sharma, I am a male, I own a house, I am 20 years old&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n, i like this girl, I love playing sports, I live here, I read this, I&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nhate that, I this, and I that&quot;, okay?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : Go on.. * feeling =\r\na bit ridiculous about himself*&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : So when Chaman dies, whi=\r\nch is going to happen sooner than&lt;br&gt;\nlater, do you know what happens or wh=\r\nat that means?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : I die, but in reality &quot;I&quot; don&#39;t die.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Very good, you have read that off of a book, ever realized i=\r\nt?&lt;br&gt;\nAre you not afraid of death?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : No, I am not afraid =\r\nof death.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe lights turn off in the room, there is total darkness=\r\n, for 5 minutes&lt;br&gt;\nthere is no noise, but Chaman gets terrified, and then =\r\na pair of deep&lt;br&gt;\nred eyes appear in the dark, and in the most ghastly voi=\r\nce ever asks Mr&lt;br&gt;\nChaman, &quot;why are you so afraid? the basis of all fear i=\r\ns death, and only&lt;br&gt;\nthe lights have gone out, I haven&#39;t even started with=\r\n you yet, if you&lt;br&gt;\nsay you are not going to die, then why so scared?&quot;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nSuddenly the lights turn back on, the teacher is laughing his ass off=\r\n,&lt;br&gt;\nwith Chaman shivering.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : You said you were not afrai=\r\nd.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : I never meant it, like that.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Then =\r\nin what way did you mean it? Take it as a lesson that&lt;br&gt;\npractical stuff i=\r\nn this spirituality business is far greater than all&lt;br&gt;\nyour books combine=\r\nd. You get lost while reading, you think you are&lt;br&gt;\ndifferent. To me you a=\r\nre no worse than the thousand others I meet,&lt;br&gt;\nin-fact they are better of=\r\nf without the texts you have studied.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : Agreed, but don&#39;t =\r\nscare me like that. Again.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : I will, if you make such ridi=\r\nculous claims again. Anyways,&lt;br&gt;\nwhere were we? The death of the teddy bea=\r\nr. Yes. But mind you the teddy&lt;br&gt;\nremains, the outer shell remains, but te=\r\nddy is dead. The outer shell is&lt;br&gt;\neither buried or burnt, in essence done=\r\n away with, because it is of no&lt;br&gt;\nuse. Right?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : Right&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Wrong. Lets get back to the toy. Consider this, when you&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nremove the battery from the toy, what happens? The toy is literally&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nuseless, it can&#39;t clap, it can&#39;t shout, it can&#39;t cry, it can&#39;t do shit.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nThus, at death, Mr Chaman, you are removed from Mr Chaman&#39;s body. You&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nnever die, you are only the battery powering this personality which&lt;br&gt;\nlea=\r\nds to powering your body.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent: How can you even=E2=80=A6=E2=80=\r\n=A6&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Lets consider that you are two batteries, two aa siz=\r\ned ones.&lt;br&gt;\nWhen you plug the batteries into a car, suddenly the car comes=\r\n to life,&lt;br&gt;\nwithout the battery the car is idle, but as soon as I put the=\r\n battery&lt;br&gt;\nin, the car goes=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6.. beep beep honk honk, move=\r\n, I am a car.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : sits in silence knowing well that interrup=\r\nting now will be the&lt;br&gt;\nbiggest mistake ever.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher :And when I=\r\n take the same batteries out of a car and put it into&lt;br&gt;\nlets say a teddy =\r\nbear, the teddy bear comes alive, start to sing a song,&lt;br&gt;\nor acts mushy. =\r\nAnd when I pull the battery out?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : Teddy is idle, literall=\r\ny useless.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Yes, but go deeper. It was the same battery t=\r\nhat powered the&lt;br&gt;\ncar, it was the same battery that powered the teddy bea=\r\nr, and it is the&lt;br&gt;\nsame battery that can power any toy, correct?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nStudent : Correct&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : While the battery is in the car, it b=\r\nelieves itself to be the&lt;br&gt;\ncar. It believes &quot;yesssss, i am a car, red col=\r\nour, 198 bhp, 70 mm&lt;br&gt;\ntorque, top speed 320kmph, 4 wheels, engine at the =\r\nback, hot woman in my&lt;br&gt;\npassengers seat, I am the king baby, look at how =\r\nhot I am&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent: Oh dear god=E2=80=A6.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Then I=\r\n take out the battery from the car. And PHAT it is a&lt;br&gt;\nuseless piece of m=\r\netal. And I plug the battery into a teddy, suddenly it&lt;br&gt;\nbelieves itself =\r\nto be the teddy, it goes &quot; yeeeeessssss, I am the teddy,&lt;br&gt;\nI am mushy, I =\r\nam soft, everybody adores me, look how cuddly I am, I can&lt;br&gt;\neven clap my =\r\nhands &quot;, and when I take the battery out, PHAT, the teddy&lt;br&gt;\nis=E2=80=A6..=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : Useless, and dead.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Thats a useless c=\r\nonclusion, it is known by the world, not&lt;br&gt;\nrealized. Every tom dick and h=\r\narry knows that, Lets go deeper. The point&lt;br&gt;\nis the battery confuses itse=\r\nlf to be the teddy or the god damn car.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : So the battery i=\r\ns the soul?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : *smacks on the student&#39;s head* Who said that=\r\n?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : You did.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : *another phatek on the hea=\r\nd of the student* When did I say?&lt;br&gt;\nYou read it in one of your fancy arti=\r\ncles and commentaries and satsangs&lt;br&gt;\nthat people do, genius, and you read=\r\n it all too wrong, you read it and&lt;br&gt;\nthus think you &#39;know&#39;, you never pra=\r\ncticed, fools you people are. Most&lt;br&gt;\nof the time you people are fed bulls=\r\nhit and you gobble it up like pigs&lt;br&gt;\nin mud. That reminds me we haven&#39;t h=\r\nad a pepperoni  pizza in a long&lt;br&gt;\ntime, lets order one. LOL&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStud=\r\nent : Sorry=E2=80=A6&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Don&#39;t be, you are my child, I love =\r\nyou. Anyways , back to our&lt;br&gt;\ndiscussion on toys. The confusion of the bat=\r\ntery. And thus Chaman, you&lt;br&gt;\nconfuse yourself to be Chaman. This is the 6=\r\n7432th time , you have been&lt;br&gt;\nplugged into a a toy (read body) and the co=\r\nnfusion prevails. Focus on&lt;br&gt;\nthe &quot;confusion&quot; aspect.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : T=\r\nhen who am I?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : You are the ever lasting consciousness, th=\r\ne universal bliss,&lt;br&gt;\nthe infinite, the ever pervading light of the univer=\r\nse!!! Breathe in and&lt;br&gt;\nout and feel the bliss!!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : Yess!!=\r\n! this is what I read, * breathes in and out deeply*&lt;br&gt;\n*Smells huge amoun=\r\nts of odor*=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6 What is that smell?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : I just=\r\n farted, feels so blissful, did you feel your bliss too?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent :=\r\n Ewwwww=E2=80=A6.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Bhutni ke, do you think we guys are fo=\r\nols who have spent lives&lt;br&gt;\nin search of who we are, and you will know jus=\r\nt by breathing in and out,&lt;br&gt;\nand thinking you are the ever lasting consci=\r\nousness and all that???&lt;br&gt;\nBefkuf!! Chaman kahin ka!!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : B=\r\nut you only said that  &quot;You are the ever lasting&lt;br&gt;\nconsciousness, the uni=\r\nversal bliss, the infinite, the ever pervading&lt;br&gt;\nlight of the universe!!!=\r\n Breathe in and out and feel the bliss!!&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : It is called a=\r\n test, and needless to say you have scored a&lt;br&gt;\ncompartment.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStud=\r\nent : Hey ram=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : So back to who=\r\n you are, you are just like the battery who is&lt;br&gt;\nthe source of that body =\r\nand the personality and confuses itself to be &quot;&lt;br&gt;\nI am Chaman Sharma, age=\r\n 20, resident of vasant vihar, have a girlfriend,&lt;br&gt;\nam a male, love to pa=\r\nrty, own a mercedez, worship a a little, interested&lt;br&gt;\nin god and whatever=\r\n &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : So who am I?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : You are duracell=E2=\r\n=80=A6..How do they write post a mathematics&lt;br&gt;\nsolution=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=\r\n=E2=80=A6Q.E.D or hence proved. QED =3D  quite easily done.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStuden=\r\nt : Thats one more self identification of being duracell&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher :=\r\n Brilliant!!!!!! Now you are talking.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent: *Feels quite proud*=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : And THAT is one more self identification.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStud=\r\nent : Hey Ram!!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Ram Ram.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : So I theoret=\r\nically understand it , but how do I actually&lt;br&gt;\nrealize it?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeach=\r\ner : You do Sadhana.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : Sitting in a yogic pose and focusin=\r\ng on the lotus and all?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : I will fucking beat you to your =\r\ndeath if you repeat this&lt;br&gt;\nbullshit ever again.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent: Sorry=\r\n=E2=80=A6&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : No need to be. That is what is meant by Sadhan=\r\na to most&lt;br&gt;\npeople. But does anyone know what is Sadhana?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStuden=\r\nt : You shed some light on it?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher: What do you think I am a b=\r\nulb? LOL, Anyways, all sadhana is&lt;br&gt;\nbasically in essence, and mark these =\r\nall important words.&lt;br&gt;\n&quot; YOU trying to convince yourself that &quot;you&quot; are n=\r\not YOU &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBirths are spent on this my boy, births not lives, it tak=\r\nes a lot of&lt;br&gt;\neffort to tell and convince yourself that you are just not =\r\nyou.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : and how do you do that?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : By sadha=\r\nna aka mostly known as repeating a mantra. You&lt;br&gt;\neventually yourself beco=\r\nme the form of the mantra that you chant, thus&lt;br&gt;\nrealizing the deity( the=\r\n big daddy battery)/ the specific form of the&lt;br&gt;\none (the source of all th=\r\ne Big and small batteries). A mantra means man&lt;br&gt;\nki tarana, does it not?&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : So by sadhana , I will realize that I am the battery and=\r\n not&lt;br&gt;\nthis personality?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Yes, but the day &quot;you&quot; realiz=\r\ne, &quot;you&quot; will go dead, to&lt;br&gt;\nyourself.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent: I am beginning to=\r\n understand a little, can you explain where&lt;br&gt;\ndoes a deity stand in this =\r\nwhole battery concept?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : If you are the battery, the batte=\r\nry has to have a source, you&lt;br&gt;\nare not svayambhu that you exist on you ow=\r\nn. The deity is like a huge&lt;br&gt;\npower station in your comparison. It is alm=\r\nost infinite, but since it is&lt;br&gt;\na power station it is bound to have a bou=\r\nndary somewhere, but to you, aa&lt;br&gt;\nsized battery it is endless. Chaman&#39;s s=\r\nource is his parents, but&lt;br&gt;\nchaman&#39;s actual source&#39;s (battery) parent is =\r\nthe power station.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : Hmmm=E2=80=A6.. that&#39;s why she is wor=\r\nshipped as ma?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Yes. Who is a Siddha?? A guy or a girl wh=\r\no has realized that&lt;br&gt;\nhe/she himself is the battery and then went on to b=\r\necome one with a&lt;br&gt;\npower station and thus sees himself/herself in everyth=\r\ning because the&lt;br&gt;\npower station is the source of everything , of all batt=\r\neries. And since&lt;br&gt;\nhe/she actually knows that all elements too are curren=\r\nts and everything&lt;br&gt;\nelse too, he/she actually sees it as that. And thus, =\r\nthe &quot;miracles&quot;. Let&lt;br&gt;\nsay I fully well don&#39;t see a difference between me =\r\nand this table, thus&lt;br&gt;\nI am this table, thus If i wish to make it fly, I =\r\ncan do it, because I&lt;br&gt;\nam actually it. To you it is a table, to me it is =\r\njust a current, who is&lt;br&gt;\njust &quot;me&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent: Oooohhhhhhhh=E2=80=\r\n=A6=E2=80=A6.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : He maybe sai baba to you, but thats how yo=\r\nur eyes perceive him&lt;br&gt;\nto be as, an old man with frail clothing, belongs =\r\nto shirdi etc etc, but&lt;br&gt;\ninside he is far beyond what you or I can compre=\r\nhend. He first realized&lt;br&gt;\nhe was a battery by doing penance, thus killing=\r\n himself in the process,&lt;br&gt;\nthe he realized that the battery is as good as=\r\n the power station because&lt;br&gt;\nthe current is the same, so he became one wi=\r\nth that, and then he went&lt;br&gt;\nbeyond and came back to guide as he was chose=\r\nn, just like many others&lt;br&gt;\nare, like my great teacher, guru nanak dev, Ra=\r\nmakrishna and all&lt;br&gt;\nothers=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : =\r\nAnd the source of the power station is?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : The one- Satya s=\r\nhri akaal , he/she/it can&#39;t be put into words&lt;br&gt;\nbecause he is infinite an=\r\nd the words are finite. It is purely on&lt;br&gt;\ndefining him religious wars, ri=\r\nots between religions , and intellectual&lt;br&gt;\ndiscussions and debates on thi=\r\ns thing called internet happen, but&lt;br&gt;\nhe/she/it is far beyond comprehensi=\r\non. Many people focus on that , and&lt;br&gt;\nget lost, but focus on the power st=\r\nation (deity) and it will take you to&lt;br&gt;\nbig daddy.&lt;br&gt;\nImagine an endless=\r\n field of current in comparison of the power station ,&lt;br&gt;\nan endless curre=\r\nnt which exists and all others are a figment of it. The&lt;br&gt;\npower stations =\r\nare a part of it, the current has taken the form of one&lt;br&gt;\nconcentrated zo=\r\nne.. But even this contains error of speech, so chuck it.&lt;br&gt;\nThe ultimate =\r\nis only realized when you are one with the power station so&lt;br&gt;\nlets focus =\r\nthere.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : So the one has taken forms of different power sta=\r\ntions to help&lt;br&gt;\nthe batteries who are spread out to help unite back with =\r\nit?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Brilliant.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent: So all our lives we deb=\r\nate/fight and cut each other off to&lt;br&gt;\nclaim which power station (deity) i=\r\ns more powerful over the other and&lt;br&gt;\nsuperior to all others, when in trut=\r\nh our eyes perceive them(deities) to&lt;br&gt;\nbe different, when they are in ess=\r\nence one(Satya shri akaal) and&lt;br&gt;\nlaughing back at us?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : =\r\nho ho ho=E2=80=A6.. Go on.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : And we try to worship 10 diff=\r\nerent ones and always think that&lt;br&gt;\nwe should worship as many to get maxim=\r\num benefit for our mistakingly&lt;br&gt;\nconfused identities of teddy , the car a=\r\nnd all other toys?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : *smokes slowly*=E2=80=A6 I am listeni=\r\nng.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent: So the biggest fools are those who are lost in debate=\r\ns and&lt;br&gt;\npseudo breathing in and out and raising kundalinis with peacock f=\r\neathers&lt;br&gt;\nand punches to the spine, reading stuff and debating on concept=\r\ns which&lt;br&gt;\nthey don&#39;t know a thing about?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher: Yes,Speaking o=\r\nf Kundalini, she is basically you, she is the&lt;br&gt;\nbattery. the stupidest th=\r\ning in the world is this concept of &quot;my&lt;br&gt;\nkundalini&quot;, err=E2=80=A6. you a=\r\nre her you idiot, how is she yours? Anyways ,&lt;br&gt;\nmany make this error, but=\r\n it is essential because other wise you can&#39;t&lt;br&gt;\nexplain the concept in sp=\r\neech. And if you do fully realize you are her,&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;you&quot; will be phat dead =\r\nin one second. Whenever you are worshipping lets&lt;br&gt;\nsay a form, you in ess=\r\nence , are worshipping yourself, in your full&lt;br&gt;\nglory . Whatever you are =\r\nworshipping is &quot;you&quot;, who is without all the&lt;br&gt;\nlimitations of Chaman/tedd=\r\ny/car/toy.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent: So then how do realized souls stay in their bo=\r\ndies post their&lt;br&gt;\nrealization?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher: Intentional identificati=\r\non with the personality by permission&lt;br&gt;\nfrom the power station to fulfill=\r\n some higher purpose of the power&lt;br&gt;\nstation to guide more batteries to re=\r\nalize that they are not toys. But&lt;br&gt;\nthey can leave in an instant, because=\r\n they know realities that are much&lt;br&gt;\nhigher than our world.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStud=\r\nent : So what is moksha?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : It is a concept that is best le=\r\nft alone, if you haven&#39;t merged&lt;br&gt;\nback with a power station yourself firs=\r\nt. You tell me when you have&lt;br&gt;\nmerged back, how do you know what if feels=\r\n like to be merged back? You&lt;br&gt;\nyourself have become one with your source,=\r\n so &quot;you&quot; don&#39;t remain, even&lt;br&gt;\nthe battery has dissolved, so how do &quot;you&quot;=\r\n explain it? You wont remember&lt;br&gt;\nit, because you are not there.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nStudent : I can&#39;t explain it.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : We can&#39;t, It is like expla=\r\nining the color red to a blind man.&lt;br&gt;\nYou will say mars  is red or the re=\r\nd light is red, he will say I have&lt;br&gt;\nbeen blind from birth I don&#39;t know w=\r\nhat you are talking about. You will&lt;br&gt;\nsay tomato, he will say fuck off.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : Yes, so It can&#39;t be explained.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : it can =\r\nbe to an extent, but it is one ridiculously convoluted&lt;br&gt;\ntopic. To add to=\r\n ti, one toy is a teddy bear, one toy is a car, one toy&lt;br&gt;\nis a helicopter=\r\n, one toy is a turtle, mind you battery is the same, but&lt;br&gt;\nthe car is ver=\r\ny different form the toy, thus if you explain a high level&lt;br&gt;\nconcept to b=\r\noth, both will understand differently and have a go at it&lt;br&gt;\nwith debates =\r\nand what not, which leads to more confusion. Better is both&lt;br&gt;\nrealize it =\r\nthemselves. So you focus on realizing that you are duracell&lt;br&gt;\nfirst, mr c=\r\nhaman, everything else comes later. Thus, You are duracell.&lt;br&gt;\nNow time fo=\r\nr my reward for my winning the bet. Dance naked on the road.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStude=\r\nnt : What?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : You thought 4 times.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent: But I =\r\nwill be disgraced.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Nope, Chaman will be, you are duracel=\r\nl, they will laugh at&lt;br&gt;\nChaman, who is your 67432nd incarnation, you have=\r\n done this thousand&lt;br&gt;\ntimes before, so what??&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : I hate y=\r\nou.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : I love you too.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : You are serious o=\r\nn this?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Very&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent: : This is why some of the=\r\n higher ones don&#39;t give a shit about&lt;br&gt;\nroaming naked and doing wild stuff=\r\n, just to keep people away from them.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Yes, but a lot of =\r\nfrauds copy and disgrace the higher ones.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : Fine, I will d=\r\no it. But you will handle my parent&#39;s reaction.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Done.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAfter the student did the act, nobody seemed to recall the act the n=\r\next&lt;br&gt;\nday, yet every one saw it that day, and seemed to make faces at the=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nstudent for an hour or so. How everybody forgot is a different story&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\naltogether.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nDo sadhana, before your battery is pulled out, repl=\r\nugged into another&lt;br&gt;\ntoy and yet again, your confusion will prevail drivi=\r\nng you to do things&lt;br&gt;\nthat will push you further and further down.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nJai Shree Radheya!!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n---724232154-1853471948-1346939767=:93776--\r\n\n"}}
