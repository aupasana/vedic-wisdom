I realized that I have very little t=\r\nime these days, apart from \n&gt; spiritual sadhana, work, driving and other da=\r\nily activities.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have uploaded the first cut of a &quot;super-short&quot; manua=\r\nl at\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/pooja/satya_ss_san.pdf (mantras in=\r\n \n&gt; Devanagari script)\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/pooja/satya_ss_eng.=\r\npdf (mantras in \n&gt; English script)\n&gt; \n&gt; These are works in progress. Please=\r\n feel free to point out errors by \n&gt; private email (pvr@...).\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope t=\r\no upload a &quot;short&quot; version in a few days. I am still working on \n&gt; it. The =\r\n&quot;regular&quot; version will most probably take a few more weeks.\n&gt; \n&gt; The purpos=\r\ne of this upload is to get feedback and also make it available \n&gt; to anyone=\r\n who wants to peruse it for the coming Full Moon. They will \n&gt; have a coupl=\r\ne of days to go through it and prepare.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once these are ready, versions=\r\n with mantras written in Telugu, Kannada, \n&gt; Gujarati etc will be prepared.=\r\n That will take a while.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the next few months, homam and fire yoga m=\r\nanuals will also be \n&gt; re-edited and streamlined. Manual will be split into=\r\n two manuals giving \n&gt; why and how. If you have any suggestions, please sen=\r\nd them to me by \n&gt; private email (pvr@...).\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n=\r\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;    =\r\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It You=\r\nrself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                 =\r\n   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       Films that make a difference: htt=\r\np://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/=\r\nvedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWr=\r\nitings\n&gt;                       Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; --------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
