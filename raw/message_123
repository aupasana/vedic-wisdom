The nine grahas are the nine \ncelestial bodies that take our consciousness into their grip when the right \ntimes comes (based on certain celestial formulas). They create environments \nand situations in our life to create certain states of mind.\n\nFor removing obstructions in material and spiritual aspects of life, we \npropitiate grahas. If a graha is pleased with our propitiation, it will not \ncreate situations that create a certain state of mind that may be a \nhindrance to our material and spiritual progress. To propitiate grahas, one \ncan read their Veda mantras or kavachas or stotras.\n\nVeda mantras are very powerful. But they work slowly (mainly because most \npeople do not know these days how to chant/experience them perfectly). Big \ncounts are needed. When you persist with a Veda mantra, it first removes the \nobstacles caused by an aspect of Brahman represented by the deity of the \nmantra and eventually creates a perfect understanding of that aspect of \nBrahman. All Veda mantras are eventually for a perfect understanding of \nvarious aspects of self only. Sun is the soul. Moon is the mind. Mars is the \nenergy/initiative/drive within. Mercury is the flexibility, ability to learn \nand adapt. Jupiter is the wisdom, discretion and judgment within a person. \nVenus is the spirit of being happy. Saturn is the spirit of working hard and \ngoing through austerities. Rahu is the spirit of breaking the barriers, \ninnovating and reaching for the unknown. Ketu is the spirit of perfect \ndetachment with everything. Veda mantra of a graha, when chanted for a long \ntime, removes the obstacles thrown by that planet based on dasa and gochara \nand eventually gives a perfect understanding of the aspect of self \nrepresented by the planet (as mentioned above).\n\nKavachas of grahas, when chanted many times, create an unseen protective \nshield around the person. Kavachas can be used for overcoming physical \nailments, health troubles, prayogas etc. Stotras are meant for pure bhakti \nmaarga. They praise various qualities of a graha. In addition, there are \nvarious beeja mantras also.\n\n*        *        *\n\nAccording to Parasara Maharshi who taught &quot;Brihat Paaraasara Horaa \nSaastram&quot;, the greatest classic on Jyotisha, grahas are Vishnu&#39;s avataras. \nThey comprise of the energies of various incarnations of Vishnu. \nRamachandra&#39;s energy is Sun. Krishna&#39;s energy is Moon. Nrisimha&#39;s energy is \nMars. Buddha&#39;s energy is Mercury. Vaamana&#39;s energy is Jupiter. Parasu \nRaama&#39;s energy is Venus. Koorma&#39;s energy is Saturn. Varaha&#39;s energy is Rahu. \nMatsya&#39;s energy is Ketu.\n\n*        *        *\n\nApart of doing japam with these graha mantras/kavachas/stotras, one can also \ndo a homam. Homam is always a better avenue than japam and others. In \nnavagraha homam, you invoke the nine grahas in fire and offer oblations with \ntheir Veda mantras several times. It is also possible to do a homam for just \none graha.\n\n*        *        *\n\nOne word about the efficacy of homam...\n\nSeeing divinity in a solid form such as an idol is shown by earth (bhoo) \nelement. It is a sureshot way to achieve, but it is extremely slow and one \nneeds to be very patient. It is difficult to maintain focus for so many \nlives in Kali yuga. One can lose one&#39;s way in the middle. Seeing divinity in \nthe water is shown by the water (jala) element. The water element is anyway \npredominent in the human body and it is imperfect in Kali yuga. It is quite \ntricky to achieve through sadhana shown by the water path in this age. \nSeeing divinity in the air we breath is the sadhana form shown by air \n(vaayu) element. It is fast, but the air we breath in so corrupt in this age \nthat this is a very risky path. Though many teach praanaayaama, hatha yoga, \nraja yoga etc these days, this path is extremely risky. It is very difficult \nto reach the end goal in this path in this age. The path of pure Vedanta, \nshown by the aakaasa (ether/space) element may also not be appropriate for \nmost in this age.\n\nIrrespective of the impurities in the food one eats, the water one drinks \nand the air one breathes and irrespective of the impurities in various nadis \nin one&#39;s system, the fire is always pure and it purifies everything that it \ncomes in touch with. That is why another name of fire is &quot;paavaka&quot; \n(purifier). You just have to expose various parts of your system to fire. \nThus, the sadhana form shown by fire (agni) element is the safest and \nquickest in this age for most people. It is quick and safe and purifies one \ndespite other distractions of Kali and helps one achieve the Ultimate \neventually.\n\nIt is possible to get *some result* in every sadhana. But, if one wants to \nmake significant progress, homam is the best sadhana. No wonder rishis put a \nlot of stress on agni kaaryam (fire ritual). These days, people - even those \nwho are born in Brahmin families - are afraid to do homam because they think \nit is complicated and one may make mistakes. However, a homam done as a \npersonal sadhana for one&#39;s own progress is different from a yaagam that is \ndone for universal benefits. While the latter is far more elaborate and \nstrict, the former is much simpler. When performed on a regular basis, it \nreally purifies one&#39;s koshas and nadis.\n\nRegularity is the key. If you eat a big bowl of almonds once every six \nmonths, you will not get enough proteins for the six months from them. On \nthe other hand, if eat a few almonds *everyday*, that may be a good source \nof proteins.\n\nWe eat a few times everyday, we drink water a few times everyday; and we \nbreath many times everyday (and all these activities are constantly pumping \nin impurities into our system!). We should also do sadhana also on a regular \nbasis.\n\nWhichever deity one wants to worship, one can worship the deity in fire for \nfaster results. This applies to Mahaganapathi, Chandi, Shiva, Lakshmi, \nNarayana or Grahas.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nHomam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Sharat&quot; &lt;gidoc@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, August 22, 2007 11:41 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Navagraha Homam/puja\n\n\n&gt; ||Namah Shivaya||\n&gt; Dear Narsimha ji,\n&gt; Could you please enlighten me about his homam and how it can be\n&gt; auspicious.\n&gt; Many thanks\n&gt; Best wishes\n&gt; Sharat\n\n\n"}}
