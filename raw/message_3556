I recommend preferring normal =\r\ndevatas to astra devatas (deities who personify weapons).\n=C2=A0\nDevatas li=\r\nke Mahasudarshana and Pratyangira are personifications of weapons. Their sa=\r\ndhanas are akin to taking a weapon and using it. When one takes a weapon, o=\r\nne can either do a ceremonial pooja to it and put it back or actually use i=\r\nt to solve problems. Though homas and poojas to astra devatas were akin to =\r\nthe latter in old days, they are akin to the former now-a-days. In the old =\r\ndays, detached sadhakas of a high caliber existed in the priest class and t=\r\nhey used to do homas and poojas to astra devatas like Mahasudarsana and Pra=\r\ntyangira and produced results quickly. Though most priests of today are onl=\r\ny capable of doing an aayudha pooja rather than using the aayudha, they nev=\r\nertheless instinctively go for these poojas based on the old habits. Howeve=\r\nr, based on the changed capabilities, one should change the strategy.\n\nJust=\r\n as a son who is troubled by bullies at school is better off complaining to=\r\n mother or father and let them take care of the problem, instead of taking =\r\nthe weapon of mother or father and trying to use it oneself, my humble opin=\r\nion is that worship of deities who hold those weapons is better today than =\r\nworship of deities personifying weapons, to solve serious problems.\n\nFor co=\r\nuntering black magic, I suggest doing Rahu-Ketu homam or Chandi homam or Na=\r\nrasimha homam. Narasimha homam with &quot;ugram veeram&quot; mantra may be a good ide=\r\na. For removing black magic, homam or worship of Dattatreya is also a good =\r\nidea.\n\nIf you want the specific material result of removing black magic, ma=\r\nintain physical purity around you when you do homam. Offer black sesame see=\r\nds in homam. If you have a pomegranate tree near you, offering pomegranate =\r\nflowers in homam is a good idea. Put a full lime (green) everyday as poorna=\r\nahuti and make sure it burns fully by putting enough fuel (wood/coconut/ghe=\r\ne) along with it. You may need to offer more ghee a few times as poornaahut=\r\ni burnas, to make it burn fully. Also, in the sankalpa of the homam, you ma=\r\ny add &quot;maamuddishya kR^itebhyaH abhicaaraadi prayogebhyo bhaavita pIDaayaaH=\r\n upashamanaarthaM&quot; (in ITrans transliteration) after &quot;so and so devataa pra=\r\nsaada siddhyartham&quot; that appears in the Sankalpa in the manuals.\n\nBest rega=\r\nrds,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------\n=C2=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writing=\r\ns,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n=\r\n=C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n----=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n--- On Fri=\r\n, 1/22/10, prm7782 &lt;prm7782@...&gt; wrote:\nFrom: prm7782 &lt;prm7782@yahoo.=\r\ncom&gt;\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] which homam to choose?\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com\nDate: Friday, January 22, 2010, 5:05 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n   =\r\n \n      \n      \n      Which homam works best for getting rid of black magic=\r\n?
