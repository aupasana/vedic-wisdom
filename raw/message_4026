It is to show the importance of perseveren=\r\nce. It does not mean that we should not worship different Gods or Goddesses=\r\n. One always has a &#39;Mula Mantra&#39; or &#39;mula Devatha&#39; for upasana. This is the=\r\n primary diety in whom ones identity is sought to be dissolved. One can do =\r\nother sadhanas in addition for maintenance of life or help in sadhana- for =\r\nexample- Devi upasana is accompanied with some form of Siva or Bhairava upa=\r\nsana as taught by Guru. This helps because it will help in getting siddhi a=\r\ns well as in protection. One may also do mrtyunjaya or mahamrtyunjaya or pr=\r\nay to Lakshmi if health or poverty are causing hindrance in ones sadhana.Th=\r\nese Gods and Goddesses may or may not be anga Devatha or Parivara devatha t=\r\no the mula Devatha. This is the traditional view.\n\nSticking to the Mula man=\r\ntra/Devatha is critical for success. One can read books about mantra sastra=\r\n to understand why.\n\nAnimal sacrifice: Animal sacrifice is permitted( in ge=\r\nneral). If one is a vegetarian, one can do naivedya of what one eats. If on=\r\ne is in the habit of eating meat- what is wrong in sacrificing the same to =\r\nthe Devatha ? If one feels it is wrong, it must be wrong for oneself also t=\r\no eat. If it is right, then it must be right in sacrificing to the Devatha =\r\nalso( depending on the nature, likes and dislikes of the Devatha of course)=\r\n. If you look at the Rahasyatrayam anga of the Chandi for example, sacrific=\r\ning and offering blood is permitted to all except &#39;dvija&#39;. That said, I for=\r\n example cannot do this because my Guru parampara does not do this and I am=\r\n a dvija( by most definitions)- so there is a double injunction against thi=\r\ns.\n\n\n\nJust my 2 paise worth from the priceless teachings of Gurus and great=\r\n souls. I am willing to indulge in discussions which will help, but will ig=\r\nnore any discussion the moment I feel my ego is getting into it.\n\nRegards,\n=\r\n\nS\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;pvklnrao&quot; &lt;pvklnrao@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; It may have been already deliberated many times, but, I had a doubt ling=\r\nering in mind still.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Siva is also reffered to as Bhakta sulabha (ea=\r\nsy to get for devotees) where as Vishnu is expected to test the devotee.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; If we look at our mythological stories, most daemons pray to Brahma or S=\r\niva and get boons easily compared Vishnu.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why is this?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Animal =\r\nsacrifice - does any of the Gods/Goddess actually want animal/human sacrifi=\r\nces? Even today, animal sacrifices are going on for local grama devatas (li=\r\nke Poturaju, Maridamma, Pocamma etc.)\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. Praying to multiple Gods/Godd=\r\ness as opposed to praying to a single God/Goddess\n&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahansa=\r\n once told a devotee, that if he digged at one place, he would have got wat=\r\ner as opposed to digging in multiple places.\n&gt; \n&gt; I look at it differently =\r\n(no dis-respect to the Takur).\n&gt; \n&gt; When we are digging a well, our final g=\r\noal is to get water.\n&gt; Here two options are there:\n&gt; Dig in muliple places =\r\nor dig in the same place using multiple instruments (use spade for some tim=\r\ne, then use a spear for some time, and so on so).\n&gt; \n&gt; Here praying to diff=\r\nerent Gods should be compared to digging in different places or digging wit=\r\nh different instruments?\n&gt; \n&gt; I felt, the famous argument against praying t=\r\no multiple Gods is comparing it to digging in multiple places.\n&gt; \n&gt; While K=\r\nali, Krishna, Ram, Bhairava all are different forms of God, they all are th=\r\ne one and only Brahman and are aware of the fact.\n&gt; If I am praying to Kris=\r\nhna with single intension of merging with Krishna, then praying to Ram may =\r\nperhaps do not help me. If I am praying to Krishna with sole goal of overco=\r\nming my short comings and spiritual growth. In such a scenario, does it mat=\r\nter whether I pray to Krishna/Ram?\n&gt; \n&gt; I do recall the discussion about vi=\r\nsualising the image of the God and that we get mantra sidhi when the though=\r\nt fills out mind. How ever, not all of us are fortunate to visualise a clea=\r\nr image. Most often when I try to visualise Rama/Krishna, a famous Telugu a=\r\nctor who used to play those roles come to my imagination. I feel, I may be =\r\nbetter of with out a visualisation.\n&gt; \n&gt; I use a Shiv ling to invoke any Go=\r\nd/Goddess along with fire.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is sticking to one God/mantra is really so =\r\ncritical?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
