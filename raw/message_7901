One&#39;s experiences and actions are due to \n&gt;&gt; the mome=\r\nntum set in motion by previously present conditioning. One \n&gt;&gt; engages in t=\r\nhem with no agendas, likes, dislikes, and attachments. Thus, \n&gt;&gt; a jeevanmu=\r\nkta operates the previous identity till the momentum comes to \n&gt;&gt; a screech=\r\ning halt and then the body, senses, sensory mind, buddhi etc \n&gt;&gt; are return=\r\ned to the original sources from which they were borrowed and \n&gt;&gt; made senti=\r\nent. But a jeevanmukta is free and unbound even while \n&gt;&gt; operating with an=\r\n identity, for binding comes from the conditioning and \n&gt;&gt;\n not from identi=\r\nfication or actions. When the identity dissolves, it is \n&gt;&gt; not any better =\r\nor any extra freedom.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Most likely, a jeevanmukta ceases to operate a=\r\nn identity after some \n&gt;&gt; time, that time depending on the strength of prio=\r\nr momentum! It can be \n&gt;&gt; days or months or years or centuries or millennia=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Nature sets such powerful momentum in place for some beings (e.g. =\r\n\n&gt;&gt; saptarshis, Vishnu, Shiva etc) that they may operate an identity for a =\r\n\n&gt;&gt; very long time after conditioning drops off completely. It may even be =\r\n\n&gt;&gt; for the entire duration of Creation. As a part of the momentum set in \n=\r\n&gt;&gt; motion previously, one may even direct a part of one&#39;s ahamkara to \n&gt;&gt; i=\r\ndentify with a newly created identity (e.g. a new incarnation). But \n&gt;&gt; thi=\r\ns is different from a normal reincarnation that happens after death. \n&gt;&gt; Vi=\r\nshnu&#39;s incarnations are an example.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Such\n a thing happens only with =\r\nbeings that have a special role to play \n&gt;&gt; in the Play of Shakti.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; H=\r\nappy MahaShivaRatri!\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; On Sun, Feb 19, 2012 at 3:07 P=\r\nM, krishna Kanth wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Pranamam,\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Sri Narasimha garu,\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; =\r\nI&#39;ve even got the similar question as Utpal.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; So is the state &#39;Mukta&#39;=\r\n will mean that the person is no longer alive? \n&gt;&gt; Also, is the Jeevan Mukt=\r\na&#39;s will attain :Mukti&#39;?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I would assume the answer for Utpal&#39;s 2nd q=\r\nuestion would be that Jeevan \n&gt;&gt; Mukta&#39;s will continue to guide people in t=\r\nhis world (carrying the will \n&gt;&gt; of god) to attain the appropriate states o=\r\nr atleast embark on the path.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Subhamasthu\n&gt;&gt; KK\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; --- On Sun, 2=\r\n/19/12, vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; From: vedic_pathak &lt;v=\r\nedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Subject:\n [vedic-wisdom] Re: On Jeevanmukti (liberation=\r\n while living)\n&gt;&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt; Date: Sunday, Februar=\r\ny 19, 2012, 11:22 PM\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Namaste,\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I have gone throug=\r\nh both of your postings thoroughly.

The problem is *conditioning* \n&gt;&gt; &gt; (likes, dislikes, wants, age=\r\nndas etc) that drives the identification \n&gt;&gt; &gt; and use of what one&#39;s ahamka=\r\nra identifies with. If ahamkara \n&gt;&gt; &gt; (identification) evaporates when chit=\r\nta (conditioning) is cleaned up, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; it is normal mukti. If ahamkara (ide=\r\nntification) remains while chitta \n&gt;&gt; &gt; (conditioning) is cleaned up, it is=\r\n jeevanmukti. It is as simple as \n&gt;&gt; &gt; that.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=\r\n=A0 *=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt; &gt; If one engages in an action with ze=\r\nro conditioning, then there is no \n&gt;&gt; &gt; karma and there are no rinas create=\r\nd. Actions (physical or mental) by \n&gt;&gt; &gt; themselves do not bind one - it is=\r\n the=C2=A0 *conditioned* actions that \n&gt;&gt; &gt; bind one! It is the likes, disl=\r\nikes, desires, agendas etc\n (i.e. \n&gt;&gt; &gt; conditioning in chitta) behind an a=\r\nction that bind one!\n&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 *=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=\r\n=A0 =C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt; &gt; If somebody who is not YET a jeevanmukta (but close) iden=\r\ntified with a \n&gt;&gt; &gt; body and engaged in an action that IS driven by some co=\r\nnditioning, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; however subtle or pure or dharmik that conditioning may b=\r\ne (!), then \n&gt;&gt; &gt; that sets in motion the law of kaarmik action-reaction wh=\r\nich will in \n&gt;&gt; &gt; due time give a particular reaction to what one identifie=\r\nd with when \n&gt;&gt; &gt; engaging in that action.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; By the time the reaction is=\r\n experienced, all the conditioning may be \n&gt;&gt; &gt; overcome and one may become=\r\n jeevanmukta. Yet, the momentum set in \n&gt;&gt; &gt; motion before one became jeeva=\r\nnmukta will continue to affect the body, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; senses and sensory mind, i.e=\r\n. whatever one&#39;s ahamkara is identifying \n&gt;&gt; &gt; with. But, because\n there is=\r\n no conditioning and hence no agendas, no \n&gt;&gt; &gt; desires, no likes and disli=\r\nkes, one neither rejoices nor protests nor \n&gt;&gt; &gt; tries to modify the happen=\r\nings to what one is identifying with.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Sensing that there is a pain requires no=\r\n conditioning. It is the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; function of manas, i.e. Chandra. Observing t=\r\nhat there is more pain in \n&gt;&gt; &gt; the evening than morning (or when swallowin=\r\ng) requires no \n&gt;&gt; &gt; conditioning. It is the function of buddhi, i.e. Budha=\r\n. But thinking \n&gt;&gt; &gt; of praying to god to reduce pain requires conditioning=\r\n in chitta \n&gt;&gt; &gt; (absent in a jeevanmukta!).\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Though a jeevanmukta is i=\r\ndentifying with a body, one does not view it \n&gt;&gt; &gt; as something his own and=\r\n something that must be kept in a particular \n&gt;&gt; &gt; state. He identifies wit=\r\nh it, but has no agendas for it. All\n that \n&gt;&gt; &gt; comes from conditioning in=\r\n chitta, which is absent now!\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The unconditioned identifier (liberated =\r\nI-ness) views what one \n&gt;&gt; &gt; identifies with as an *amalgam* of portions bo=\r\nrrowed from various \n&gt;&gt; &gt; deities (pancha mahabhootas, Moon, Mercury, Indra=\r\n, Mitra, Varuna, Time \n&gt;&gt; &gt; etc) and hence as a manifestation of Light itse=\r\nlf. One does not view \n&gt;&gt; &gt; it from the prism of &quot;this is me, I need to use=\r\n it to pursue X or Y \n&gt;&gt; &gt; agenda.&quot; One views it as &quot;this is me. I am made =\r\nof portions borrowed \n&gt;&gt; &gt; from various deities, i.e. various manifestation=\r\ns of Light. I observe \n&gt;&gt; &gt; their play, i.e. what they do, and I have no ag=\r\nenda pursue using \n&gt;&gt; &gt; them.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; This is the essence of Upanishads and Y=\r\noga Vaasishtham, as well as \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Mantra Pushpam that we were discussing a =\r\nwhile back.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I repeat, identification is not the problem.

That is the point. Not that he was=\r\n oblivious \n&gt;&gt; &gt; to the suffering. And, we say that he was a Jeevanmukta. S=\r\no how can \n&gt;&gt; &gt; that happen, if according to that definition, the mind must=\r\n be \n&gt;&gt; &gt; identifying 24/7 with Atma to be qualified as a Jeevanmukta?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n The answer is straight forward.

I=\r\n will answer the following question posed by Manish \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; based on my unde=\r\nrstanding: &lt;&lt;&lt;The question to my mind is this: was \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Ramakrishna a Jee=\r\nvanmukta? If so, Why did he suffer with throat \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; cancer if he was not =\r\nidentifying with his actions? (according to your \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; interpretation of V=\r\nasistha&#39;s definition??)&gt;&gt;&gt; * =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A * =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A * Let me elaborate on my u=\r\nnderstanding of jeevanmukti. Manish \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; loosely (in my view) said in thi=\r\ns exchange that rinas are of body and \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a\n jeevanmukta continues to fu=\r\nlfil those rinas. But body is an \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; insentient object. It has no rinas.=\r\n The rinas are not of the body, \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; but of the mind that identifies with=\r\n it. It is the antahkaranas of \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mind - ahamkara (I-ness) and chitta (=\r\nmemory/conditioning) - that are \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the source of various rinas, particu=\r\nlarly chitta. As mind identifies \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with a body, it projects its rinas =\r\non the body and makes the body \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;do&quot; things, in acco=\r\nrdance with those \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; rinas/conditioning. If the conditioning in chitta =\r\nis completely wiped \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; out and ahamkara merges in Self, then it is mukt=\r\ni. But, if the \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta is completely wiped out and ye=\r\nt ahamkara \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; continues to exist with no limiting notions (it is basica=\r\nlly the \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta that is limiting), then one\n becomes =\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta (liberated while living). Unlike in the case of one who =\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; leaves body and gets mukti, a jeevanmukta continues to have an I-nes=\r\ns \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (but which is not limited by any notions or conditioning). This \n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; unconditioned I-ness does project into a body. But it does not say &quot;I =\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; am this body and hence this body should be kept healthy or strong&quot; \n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (THAT would be conditioning in chitta, which is wiped out now!). On \n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the other hand, it does not either say &quot;this body should be ignored \n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and destroyed&quot;. Though conditioning is absent now, body keeps \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nexperiencing and doing things based on the *momentum* set in motion \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nbefore one became jeevanmukta and engaged in conditioned experiences \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n and actions. This is like a fan turning for a while after the \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n elec=\r\ntricity has been stopped. Manas, buddhi and indriyas keep working \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; as=\r\n they did before. If one has throat cancer, indriyas may sense \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; pain.=\r\n Manas (sensory/motor mind) may process that input and register \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; pain=\r\n. Buddhi may analyze various observations and draw various \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; conclusio=\r\nns (e.g. &quot;when I gulp or try to swallow food, it hurts even \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; more&quot;, &quot;=\r\nwhen I take so and so herbal liquid, it feels better&quot; etc). A \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; normal=\r\n person whose conditioned mind (chitta) says &quot;I should overcome \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and =\r\nnot have this pain&quot; may think of various things to do and \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; struggle w=\r\nith them. But an unconditioned being has no such \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; considerations. Tho=\r\nugh one may feel and express the pain and other \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; objective experience=\r\ns, one reacts to it differently. * =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=\r\n=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A * =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n =C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A * This is a key point=\r\n: Manas and buddhi are good at making \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; objective observations and rat=\r\nional deductions, but, by themselves, \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; they do not have ANY agenda. T=\r\nhey neither like something nor dislike \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; something. THAT comes from th=\r\ne conditioning in chitta! The hallmark \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of a jeevanmukta is that THAT=\r\n is absent! * =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=\r\n=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A * =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A * \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Whether Ramakrishna was a jeevanmu=\r\nkta is a moot question. A better \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; way to express your question is: Ca=\r\nn a jeevanmukta get throat cancer \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and feel pain? How is it possible =\r\nif there are no karmas or rinas \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; left? I have already answered it. Bu=\r\nt, let me sum it up briefly \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; again. Body, various body parts, jnanend=\r\nriyas, karmendiyas, manas and \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; buddhi of a jeevanmukta\n continue to o=\r\nperate as before. One&#39;s I-ness \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is intact and does project itself ont=\r\no those. But neither I-ness nor \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; those things carry any rinas or karm=\r\nas. Chitta - the repository of \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning and rinas - is clean. Th=\r\nere are no limiting notions. \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; One&#39;s body, indriyas, manas & buddhi ke=\r\nep experiencing and doing \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; things (good or bad!) based on the previou=\r\ns momentum set by the play \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of rnas and karmas while some conditionin=\r\ng was left in chitta. Body, \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; various body parts, indriyas of jnana an=\r\nd karma and manas are all \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; portions borrowed from various deities. Ah=\r\namkara (I-ness) infuses \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sentience into them by projecting awareness =\r\ninto them. The \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta is what drives how all these a=\r\nre viewed and \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; used. Instead of looking at a sense organ as a portion=\r\n of\n Indra or \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Mitra, one views it as &quot;my so and so sense organ&quot;, due=\r\n to \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta. That is what creates karmas and rinas. W=\r\nhen \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that conditioning is *completely* overcome, ahamkara can still \n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; project awareness into those objects, but it sees them for what they =\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; are. It does not have false and limiting notions like &quot;this throat i=\r\ns \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mine and MUST feel nice and not feel painful&quot;. * =C3=83=E2=80=9A=\r\n=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A * =C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A * Most people who may claim to be (or think they are) jeevanmuktas \n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; are not really jeevanmuktas in today&#39;s world. If one wants to \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; und=\r\nerstand the state of jeevanmukti, Yoga Vaasishtham is the best \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; book.=\r\n The entire discourse by Maharshi Vasishtha to Lord Rama is a \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; detail=\r\ned and elaborate definition and\n characterization of a \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta. =\r\nThere may be other books that explain better how to do \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; various sadha=\r\nnas to progress spiritually and get closer to being \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; liberated oneday=\r\n. But, when it comes elaborating what liberation \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; while living actual=\r\nly is, there is none better than Yoga Vaasishtham. \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, one ca=\r\nn say that this is merely an intellectual exercise \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; as far as *we* ar=\r\ne concerned. It perhaps is, as none of may ever \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; become a jeevanmukta=\r\n.. One word of caution: I write with a very \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; confident tone when I ha=\r\nve strong conviction in what I write. That is \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; how I am. But I can de=\r\nfinitely be wrong. So please feel free to \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ignore me! :-) Happy Shiva=\r\nratri (tomorrow night) to all!

Nothing really,\n fulfilli=\r\nng all rnas, wait for \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; rnas to be over. Narasimha: If a &quot;jeevanmukta&quot;=\r\n fails in &quot;fulfilling \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; all rnas&quot;, will he b bound again? If no, y r t=\r\nhey called rnas? If \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; yes, y call him mukta? Manish: No, rnas will wor=\r\nk out themselves, \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; slowly or fast as may be the case. The rnas are of=\r\n the body he or she \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; occupies. He is mukta because he experiences, ac=\r\ntually sees the rnas \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to be the body&#39;s only. Rnas apply to the body, =\r\nnot to you. You are \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that &quot;speck of effulgent light&quot;, call it what yo=\r\nu want, Atma, etc. \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: Well, that speck of effulgent light wa=\r\ns never bound. So, \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; who exactly bcame &quot;mukta&quot;? Did & does he/it have =\r\nrnas? If these &quot;rnas \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of body&quot; r somehow not fulfilled after one bcom=\r\nes jeevanmukta, what \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; happens to one? :-) Manish: You are right. The =\r\nmind\n thought, that, it \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; was the body, instead of this light. That is=\r\n the original problem. \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Which every being is born with. Rnas arise fr=\r\nom this identification \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; which creates karma. U r not that, so u r not=\r\n bound, when the mind \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; realises this. Became &quot;Mukta&quot; is also not quit=\r\ne true, since u r that \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Light&quot; frm d beginning Narasimha: Then, r th=\r\ne rnas of the &quot;body&quot; as \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; u said r of the mind? When a mind identifies=\r\n with light & bcomes \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mukta, does it hv rnas left? Manish: Ok, karmas=\r\n projected into mind, \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; are acted on and may be experienced by body. S=\r\no, why is a jeevanmukta \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; subject to this? because, that person althou=\r\ngh aware of the light at \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; all times, and of the causal n subtle bodie=\r\ns, has not yet directed d \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mind to identify as that light at all time=\r\ns, key word being\n &quot;all&quot;. \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This gives karmas time to work. Next stage=\r\n is 24/7 id with light \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: As per my understanding, the perso=\r\nn u r defining is not a \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta. He may b an elevated being, but=\r\n not mukta (liberated) \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; yet. Manish: I derive that definition of this=\r\n &quot;state&quot; from somebody, \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; no problem in disagreement. 24/7 identificat=\r\nion with light, most \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; likely body should not exist, no? Narasimha: Id=\r\n with light forever \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with body dropping off is just mukti, not jivanm=\r\nukti! Jivanmukti is \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; where body stays. Is body really different from =\r\nlight? In fact, is \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; there anything other than light? Jivanmukti is se=\r\neing the play of \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; objects but seeing all as light. Mukti & rna are co=\r\nntradictory \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; concepts & cant coexist. U rnt &quot;free&quot; till u pay back wh=\r\nat u owe. And \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n that means u dont owe anybody anything once u r truly=\r\n free. Words \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; like free, liberated & jivanmukta r often misused. Mani=\r\nsh: Will \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; explain a bit in detail sometime. Narasimha: OK. :-) But, a=\r\ns far as \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;explaining&quot; is concerned, Vasishtha explained as clearly &=\r\n \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; elaborately as any human being can ever hope 2. Manish: The questio=\r\nn \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to my mind is this: was Ramakrishna a Jeevanmukta? If so, Why did =\r\nhe \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; suffer with throat cancer if he was not identifying with his acti=\r\nons? \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (according to your interpretation of Vasistha&#39;s definition??) \n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: Vasishtha didnt give a single definition.

Is it true only for western countries or India as we=\r\nll. In India in all the Temples sweet dishes are made and offered to Deitie=\r\ns.

One&#39;s experiences and actions are due to &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; the momentum set in motion by previously present conditioning. One &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; engages in them with no agendas, likes, dislikes, and attachments.=\r\n Thus, &lt;br&gt;&gt; a jeevanmukta operates the previous identity till the momen=\r\ntum comes to &lt;br&gt;&gt; a screeching halt and then the body, senses, sensory =\r\nmind, buddhi etc &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; are returned to the original sources from which =\r\nthey were borrowed and &lt;br&gt;&gt; made sentient. But a jeevanmukta is free an=\r\nd unbound even while &lt;br&gt;&gt; operating with an identity, for binding comes=\r\n from the conditioning and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\n not from identification or actions. W=\r\nhen the identity dissolves, it is &lt;br&gt;&gt; not any better or any extra free=\r\ndom.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Most likely, a jeevanmukta ceases to operate an ident=\r\nity after some &lt;br&gt;&gt; time, that time depending on the strength of prior =\r\nmomentum! It can be &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; days or months or years or centuries or mille=\r\nnnia.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Nature sets such powerful momentum in place for some=\r\n beings (e.g. &lt;br&gt;&gt; saptarshis, Vishnu, Shiva etc) that they may operate=\r\n an identity for a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; very long time after conditioning drops off co=\r\nmpletely. It may even be &lt;br&gt;&gt; for the entire duration of Creation. As a=\r\n part of the momentum set in &lt;br&gt;&gt; motion previously, one may even direc=\r\nt a part of one&#39;s ahamkara to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; identify with a newly created ident=\r\nity (e.g. a new incarnation).

I wasn&#39;t perhaps clear enough. Obviously, &lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; these are not easy ideas to communicate in vaikhari (external &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; communication). I pray to Maharshi Vasishtha to imbibe something m=\r\nore &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; than vaikhari in the following words so that people can u=\r\nnderstand &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; better (not you Manish, the goal of answering your =\r\nquestions is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; obviously not to impart any knowledge to YOU, b=\r\nut to perhaps benefit &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; some others who may be ready - now or i=\r\nn future).&lt;br&gt;&gt;\n &gt; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;=\r\n &nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; The problem is not identification. The problem is *c=\r\nonditioning* &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; (likes, dislikes, wants, agendas etc) that drive=\r\ns the identification &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; and use of what one&#39;s ahamkara identifie=\r\ns with. If ahamkara &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (identification) evaporates when chitta =\r\n(conditioning) is cleaned up, &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; it is normal mukti. If ahamkara=\r\n (identification) remains while chitta &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; (conditioning) is clea=\r\nned up, it is jeevanmukti. It is as simple as &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; that.&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; If one engages in an action with zero conditioning, then there is no &lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; karma and there are no rinas created. Actions (physical or menta=\r\nl) by &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; themselves do not bind one - it is the&nbsp; *condition=\r\ned* actions that &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; bind one! It is the likes, dislikes, desire=\r\ns, agendas etc\n (i.e. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; conditioning in chitta) behind an actio=\r\nn that bind one!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &=\r\nnbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; If somebody who is not YET a jeevanmukta (but c=\r\nlose) identified with a &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; body and engaged in an action that IS=\r\n driven by some conditioning, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; however subtle or pure or dhar=\r\nmik that conditioning may be (!), then &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; that sets in motion th=\r\ne law of kaarmik action-reaction which will in &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; due time give =\r\na particular reaction to what one identified with when &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; engag=\r\ning in that action.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; By the time the reaction is experienced, a=\r\nll the conditioning may be &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; overcome and one may become jeevan=\r\nmukta. Yet, the momentum set in &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; motion before one became jeev=\r\nanmukta will continue to affect the body, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; senses and sensory=\r\n mind, i.e. whatever one&#39;s ahamkara is identifying &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; with. But,=\r\n because\n there is no conditioning and hence no agendas, no &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; d=\r\nesires, no likes and dislikes, one neither rejoices nor protests nor &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; tries to modify the happenings to what one is identifying with.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; Sensing that there is a pain requires no conditioning. It is the &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; function of manas, i.e. Chandra. Observing that there is more =\r\npain in &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; the evening than morning (or when swallowing) require=\r\ns no &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; conditioning. It is the function of buddhi, i.e. Budha.=\r\n But thinking &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; of praying to god to reduce pain requires condi=\r\ntioning in chitta &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; (absent in a jeevanmukta!).&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Th=\r\nough a jeevanmukta is identifying with a body, one does not view it &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; as something his own and something that must be kept in a particula=\r\nr &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; state. He identifies with it, but has no agendas for it. Al=\r\nl\n that &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; comes from conditioning in chitta, which is absent no=\r\nw!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; The unconditioned identifier (liberated I-ness) views what =\r\none &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; identifies with as an *amalgam* of portions borrowed from=\r\n various &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; deities (pancha mahabhootas, Moon, Mercury, Indra, =\r\nMitra, Varuna, Time &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; etc) and hence as a manifestation of Ligh=\r\nt itself. One does not view &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; it from the prism of &quot;this is me,=\r\n I need to use it to pursue X or Y &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; agenda.&quot; One views it as =\r\n&quot;this is me. I am made of portions borrowed &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; from various deit=\r\nies, i.e. various manifestations of Light. I observe &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; their pl=\r\nay, i.e. what they do, and I have no agenda pursue using &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the=\r\nm.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; This is the essence of Upanishads and Yoga Vaasishtham, as=\r\n well as &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Mantra Pushpam that we were discussing a while back.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; I repeat, identification is not the problem. It is the\n condi=\r\ntioning &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; that drives how one uses what one identifies with, th=\r\nat is the &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; problem.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; =\r\n*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; I now feel like I have expresse=\r\nd myself better, though, given how &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; subtle and nuanced this k=\r\nnowledge is, some people may still get &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; confused (if so, pleas=\r\ne don&#39;t worry. Not a big deal. Just keep doing &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana, for t=\r\nhat&#39;s the most important thing!). I am grateful to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Manish an=\r\nd Maharshi Vasishtha for giving me this opportunity.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; BTW, whet=\r\nher Ramakrishna really got throat cancer because of his &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;insu=\r\nlt&quot; of Trilinga Swami or because he took the kaarmik power of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; attorney from Girish (a drunkard and womanizer at the time) can be &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; debated. Strictly speaking, whether Ramakrishna really became a &lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; jeevanmukta in that lifetime or not can also be\n debated.

The question =\r\nwas as I asked it. Why did &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna get the affliction (m=\r\ny question presumes, that he got it &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; as a result of that insul=\r\nt) If his mind did not identify with his\n &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; body, 24/7,But inst=\r\nead with Atma, then the karma would not have &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; afflicted him, a=\r\ns there was no identification, so no karma (like &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Krishna) If =\r\nit did afflict that body, then it is obvious that there &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; was =\r\ngood enough identification of mind with body, that he could not &lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; escape the karmic result. That is the point. Not that he was oblivious &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; to the suffering. And, we say that he was a Jeevanmukta. So ho=\r\nw can &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; that happen, if according to that definition, the mind=\r\n must be &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; identifying 24/7 with Atma to be qualified as a Jeev=\r\nanmukta?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; The answer is straight forward.

Some portions of the Twitter exchange are quoted at &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt; the end, in chronological order, in case someone is interested =\r\nin the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; background. I will answer the following question =\r\nposed by Manish &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; based on my understanding: &lt;&lt;&lt;Th=\r\ne question to my mind is this: was &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Ramakrishna a Jeevanmu=\r\nkta? If so, Why did he suffer with throat &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; cancer if he w=\r\nas not identifying with his actions? (according to your &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; i=\r\nnterpretation of Vasistha&#39;s definition??)&gt;&gt;&gt; * =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbs=\r\np; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A * =C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A * Let me elaborate on my understanding of jeevanmukti. Manish &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; loosely (in my view) said in this exchange that rinas are o=\r\nf body and &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a\n jeevanmukta continues to fulfil those rinas=\r\n. But body is an &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; insentient object. It has no rinas. The =\r\nrinas are not of the body, &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; but of the mind that identifie=\r\ns with it. It is the antahkaranas of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mind - ahamkara (I-=\r\nness) and chitta (memory/conditioning) - that are &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the sou=\r\nrce of various rinas, particularly chitta. As mind identifies &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; with a body, it projects its rinas on the body and makes the body &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;do&quot; things, in accordance with those &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt; rinas/conditioning. If the conditioning in chitta is completel=\r\ny wiped &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; out and ahamkara merges in Self, then it is mukti=\r\n. But, if the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta is completely wiped=\r\n out and yet ahamkara &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; continues to exist with no limiting=\r\n notions (it is basically the &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta that=\r\n is limiting), then one\n becomes &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta (liberated w=\r\nhile living). Unlike in the case of one who &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; leaves body a=\r\nnd gets mukti, a jeevanmukta continues to have an I-ness &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n(but which is not limited by any notions or conditioning). This &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt;&gt; unconditioned I-ness does project into a body. But it does not say =\r\n&quot;I &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; am this body and hence this body should be kept health=\r\ny or strong&quot; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (THAT would be conditioning in chitta, which=\r\n is wiped out now!). On &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the other hand, it does not eith=\r\ner say &quot;this body should be ignored &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and destroyed&quot;. Thoug=\r\nh conditioning is absent now, body keeps &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; experiencing and=\r\n doing things based on the *momentum* set in motion &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; befo=\r\nre one became jeevanmukta and engaged in conditioned experiences &lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;&gt; and actions. This is like a fan turning for a while after the &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt;\n electricity has been stopped. Manas, buddhi and indriyas keep=\r\n working &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; as they did before. If one has throat cancer, in=\r\ndriyas may sense &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; pain. Manas (sensory/motor mind) may pro=\r\ncess that input and register &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; pain. Buddhi may analyze va=\r\nrious observations and draw various &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; conclusions (e.g. &quot;wh=\r\nen I gulp or try to swallow food, it hurts even &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; more&quot;, &quot;w=\r\nhen I take so and so herbal liquid, it feels better&quot; etc). A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; normal person whose conditioned mind (chitta) says &quot;I should overcome =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and not have this pain&quot; may think of various things to do=\r\n and &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; struggle with them. But an unconditioned being has n=\r\no such &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; considerations. Though one may feel and express t=\r\nhe pain and other &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; objective experiences, one reacts to it=\r\n differently. * =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=\r\n&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A * =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n =C3=83=E2=80=9A=\r\n&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A * This is a key point: Manas a=\r\nnd buddhi are good at making &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; objective observations and r=\r\national deductions, but, by themselves, &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; they do not have =\r\nANY agenda. They neither like something nor dislike &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; some=\r\nthing. THAT comes from the conditioning in chitta! The hallmark &lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt; of a jeevanmukta is that THAT is absent! * =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A * =C3=83=E2=80=9A&=\r\nnbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A * &lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt; Whether Ramakrishna was a jeevanmukta is a moot question. A bett=\r\ner &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; way to express your question is: Can a jeevanmukta ge=\r\nt throat cancer &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and feel pain? How is it possible if ther=\r\ne are no karmas or rinas &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; left? I have already answered it=\r\n. But, let me sum it up briefly &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; again. Body, various bod=\r\ny parts, jnanendriyas, karmendiyas, manas and &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; buddhi of a=\r\n jeevanmukta\n continue to operate as before. One&#39;s I-ness &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n is intact and does project itself onto those. But neither I-ness nor &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt; those things carry any rinas or karmas. Chitta - the repositor=\r\ny of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning and rinas - is clean. There are no lim=\r\niting notions. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; One&#39;s body, indriyas, manas &amp; buddhi k=\r\neep experiencing and doing &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; things (good or bad!) based on=\r\n the previous momentum set by the play &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of rnas and karma=\r\ns while some conditioning was left in chitta. Body, &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; vario=\r\nus body parts, indriyas of jnana and karma and manas are all &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&=\r\ngt; portions borrowed from various deities. Ahamkara (I-ness) infuses &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sentience into them by projecting awareness into them. The &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta is what drives how all these are vie=\r\nwed and &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; used. Instead of looking at a sense organ as a po=\r\nrtion of\n Indra or &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Mitra, one views it as &quot;my so and so s=\r\nense organ&quot;, due to &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta. That is what =\r\ncreates karmas and rinas. When &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that conditioning is *comp=\r\nletely* overcome, ahamkara can still &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; project awareness i=\r\nnto those objects, but it sees them for what they &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; are. It=\r\n does not have false and limiting notions like &quot;this throat is &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt; mine and MUST feel nice and not feel painful&quot;. * =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp=\r\n; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A * =C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A * Most people who may claim to be (or think they are) jeevanmu=\r\nktas &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; are not really jeevanmuktas in today&#39;s world. If one=\r\n wants to &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; understand the state of jeevanmukti, Yoga Vaasi=\r\nshtham is the best &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; book. The entire discourse by Maharsh=\r\ni Vasishtha to Lord Rama is a &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; detailed and elaborate defi=\r\nnition and\n characterization of a &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta. There may =\r\nbe other books that explain better how to do &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; various sadh=\r\nanas to progress spiritually and get closer to being &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; libe=\r\nrated oneday. But, when it comes elaborating what liberation &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; while living actually is, there is none better than Yoga Vaasishtham. =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, one can say that this is merely an intellectua=\r\nl exercise &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; as far as *we* are concerned. It perhaps is, a=\r\ns none of may ever &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; become a jeevanmukta.. One word of ca=\r\nution: I write with a very &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; confident tone when I have str=\r\nong conviction in what I write. That is &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; how I am. But I c=\r\nan definitely be wrong. So please feel free to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ignore me=\r\n! :-) Happy Shivaratri (tomorrow night) to all!
