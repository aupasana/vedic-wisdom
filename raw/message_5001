The real tests are =\r\nthe one that God takes to check on our \ninternal enemies.=C2=A0 It is easy =\r\nto tackle the=C2=A0karmic blockage=C2=A0but not easy to pass \nthese tests .=\r\n\n\nThere have been examples where members quoted how they were standing in a=\r\n stall \nand suddenly a woman came up to him asking for money. We are hesita=\r\nnt to give \nmoney the very thought what if she is a con what if she is evil=\r\n minded etc comes \nin our mind. Why do these thoughts make the way because =\r\nof our attachment \ntowards money? Who cares give the money and let God take=\r\n care of it. There are \nsimilar tests Mother takes and they become difficul=\r\nt as one progresses. Also be \nwarned mother punishes those who fail. Hence =\r\nthe fact that one need not fear \nmother and keep praying is wrong. Just lik=\r\ne a kid that won&#39;t listen until a fear \nis instilled in his mind similarly =\r\nsadhakas won&#39;t reform the ways if there is no \nfear instilled in our mind. =\r\nHence fear is needed,=C2=A0Keep praying her with \ndevotion, 100% surrender=\r\n=C2=A0to her at the same time fight the internal enemies=C2=A0is \nwhat I ha=\r\nve learned so far. \n\n\nAlso I disagree with the fact that one should ignore =\r\nthe tests. These tests are \nsimilar to the one we take in college exams. On=\r\ne has to be prepared for it \nmentally. Without preparation one will keep fa=\r\niling and make no progress. \n\n\nComing to the point why tests are needed ...=\r\nthey are needed to cleanse our \nsouls.=C2=A0Only with soul cleansing one ca=\r\nn come=C2=A0closer to God. =C2=A0\n\nLike I said I am very inferior in my thi=\r\nnking and maybe wrong.

When=\r\n one performs a sadhana, it is only\n&gt;&gt;to achieve\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; some goal whether th=\r\nat be spiritual or material objective and the\n&gt;&gt;need for\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana is b=\r\necuase the native feels that otherwise he/she may not be\n&gt;&gt;able\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; to=C3=\r\n=82 achive the goal easily. So essentially the purpose of a\n&gt;&gt;sadhana is to=\r\n remove\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; the karmic burden towards achieving the goal. Law of karma do=\r\nes not\n&gt;&gt;let anyone\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; of the hook though. The harships that you face wh=\r\nile performing a\n&gt;&gt;sadhana might\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; appear like a &quot;test&quot; to a sadhaka bu=\r\nt is essentially the Lord\n&gt;&gt;bringing necessary\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; hardships your way whi=\r\nch creates the suffering in the sadhaka that\n&gt;&gt;lets the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhaka shed =\r\nsome of the karma. The sadhaka will eventually be\n&gt;&gt;successful but\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; th=\r\ne effort required and the hardships that are yet to be faced\n&gt;&gt;depends on t=\r\nhe\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; karmic burden.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; If the karmic burden is less, suffering=\r\n is less and success is\n&gt;&gt;obtained without\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; much suffering (relatively=\r\n speaking). If the karmic burden is very\n&gt;&gt;heavy, you\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; may suffer with=\r\nout seeing any success.

Although I am inferior to all of you but still I would =\r\nlike to offer my two cents.&nbsp; I believe the karmic blockages one suffer=\r\ns are not tests. The real tests are the one that God takes to check on our =\r\ninternal enemies.&nbsp; It is easy to tackle the&nbsp;karmic blockage&nbsp;=\r\nbut not easy to pass these tests .&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;There have =\r\nbeen examples where members quoted how they were standing in a stall and su=\r\nddenly a woman came up to him asking for money. We are hesitant to give mon=\r\ney the very thought what if she is a con what if she is evil minded etc com=\r\nes in our mind. Why do these thoughts make the way because of our attachmen=\r\nt towards money? Who cares give the money and let God take care of it. Ther=\r\ne are similar tests Mother takes and they become difficult as one progresse=\r\ns. Also be warned mother punishes those who fail. Hence the fact that one n=\r\need not fear mother and keep praying is wrong. Just like a kid that won&#39;t l=\r\nisten until a fear is instilled in his mind similarly sadhakas won&#39;t reform=\r\n the ways if there is no fear instilled in our mind. Hence fear is needed,&=\r\nnbsp;Keep praying her with devotion, 100% surrender&nbsp;to her at the same=\r\n time fight the internal enemies&nbsp;is what I have learned so far. &lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Also I disagree with the fact that one should ignor=\r\ne the tests. These tests are similar to the one we take in college exams. O=\r\nne has to be prepared for it mentally. Without preparation one will keep fa=\r\niling and make no progress. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Coming to the poi=\r\nnt why tests are needed ...they are needed to cleanse our souls.&nbsp;Only =\r\nwith soul cleansing one can come&nbsp;closer to God. &nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Like I said I am very inferior in my thinking and maybe wrong=\r\n. Hence kindly don&#39;t take my words as disrespectful but its just my opinion=\r\n and members may feel free to correct my thinking. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks and Regards,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Priya&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 1=\r\n2pt;

by Shakthi.&lt;BR&gt;To put more more clearly, one performs =\r\nthe spiritual sadhana keeping in mind&nbsp; one&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&quot;ishta devata&quot; to enha=\r\nnce one&#39;s soul to the higher self.&nbsp; It is only fringe benefits if one&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;come across materialistic benefits in the process.&nbsp; The main aim an=\r\nd success is only to enhance one&#39;s soul to the higher plane.&nbsp; Any test=\r\n or sufferings by the physical body in no way affect the enhancement of the=\r\n soul.&nbsp; The physical body suffers because the Karma&lt;BR&gt;one has done.&n=\r\nbsp; But it is to be understood, any spritual sadhana has got great potenti=\r\nal&lt;BR&gt;not only to enhance the soul; but also bestow the materialistic benef=\r\nits, just like that.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hence it is absolutely necessary to continue th=\r\ne spiritual process instead of diverting the &lt;BR&gt;energies by thinking about=\r\n &#39;test&#39; and &#39;problems which will automatically grant\n the material&lt;BR&gt;benef=\r\nits also.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With love&lt;BR&gt;SS&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Fri, 10/1/10, krishna Kan=\r\nth &lt;I&gt;&lt;kritels@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;

But what can be&lt;BR&gt;said after&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; some logical thinking is that if needs to &quot;test&quot; her bhakts on some&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nmatter, then&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; obviously she does not know her bhakt becuase oth=\r\nerwise there would&lt;BR&gt;be no need&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; for a test. And if she does n=\r\not know her bhakt, how can she be the&lt;BR&gt;shakti to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; rule over a=\r\nll?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The tests which people refer to are usually t=\r\nhe hardships that one&lt;BR&gt;has to face&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; while undertaking a sadha=\r\nna. When one performs a sadhana, it is only&lt;BR&gt;to achieve&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; som=\r\ne goal whether that be spiritual or material objective and the&lt;BR&gt;need for&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana is becuase the native feels that otherwise he/she may =\r\nnot be&lt;BR&gt;able&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to=C3=82 achive the goal easily. So essentially=\r\n the purpose of a&lt;BR&gt;sadhana is to remove&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the karmic burden to=\r\nwards achieving the goal. Law of karma does not&lt;BR&gt;let anyone&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nof the hook though. The harships that you face while performing a&lt;BR&gt;sadhan=\r\na might&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; appear like a &quot;test&quot; to a sadhaka but is essentially t=\r\nhe Lord&lt;BR&gt;bringing necessary&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; hardships your way which creates=\r\n the suffering in the sadhaka that&lt;BR&gt;lets the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhaka shed so=\r\nme of the karma. The sadhaka will eventually be&lt;BR&gt;successful but&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; the effort required and the hardships that are yet to be faced&lt;BR&gt;depen=\r\nds on the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; karmic burden.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If the karm=\r\nic burden is less, suffering is less and success is&lt;BR&gt;obtained\n without&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; much suffering (relatively speaking). If the karmic burden is ve=\r\nry&lt;BR&gt;heavy, you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; may suffer without seeing any success. Though=\r\n you are now closer to&lt;BR&gt;your goal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; after the suffering, but s=\r\nince the goal is not achieved, you do not&lt;BR&gt;see the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; results o=\r\nf your effort and feel the effort was a waste.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; MA=\r\n does not tests...the hardships are brought to your way by her to&lt;BR&gt;purge =\r\nyou&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; karmically to let you achieve what you want.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; This is my belief, and this I use as a basis when performing a=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;sadhana. I am&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sure others may have other views though.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bhupendra.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;

target=3D_blank&gt;kali.bt=\r\n&lt;/A&gt; i feel&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; i had and may be have to face several tests....lik=\r\ne initially...i&lt;BR&gt;read books on&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; tantra....wich promise highly=\r\n materialistically beneficial&lt;BR&gt;sadhanas..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and alarmingly dif=\r\nferent dieties for each purpose...i fell for&lt;BR&gt;that...an my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; d=\r\nevotion was divided...between maa kali,durga,laxmi,hanumanji..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; with time i realized all these have no value without a gurus&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;guidance.....my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; astrologer told me....that time will be arn=\r\nd 29-30 of my age.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; then\n again...i was against kr=\r\nishna worship.....cuzz i thot&lt;BR&gt;fooshingly since he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; is only a=\r\nbout love(bhakti)....he may not be strong like devis..&lt;BR&gt;&gt;

&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; with time again i learnt bhakti =\r\nis the highest.......i asked once a&lt;BR&gt;maharaj who&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; presides ov=\r\ner the ashram where my mother was initiated ...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; which is more =\r\npowerful ?? bhakti or mantras ??....&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; he said...in=\r\n one word...bhakti is more powerful...without bhakti u&lt;BR&gt;wont have the&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; urge to have a mantra...&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; again in a bo=\r\nok....i read...the love of gopis for krishna was&lt;BR&gt;such.....they&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; forgot everything of mundane world..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; they didnot want to k=\r\nnow who krishna was.....dint care if he was god&lt;BR&gt;or&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; not.....=\r\n.jst loving for the sake of loving..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; bhakti only for the sake =\r\nof bhakti....&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; how wonderful !!!....all these made=\r\n me realize.....how foolish i&lt;BR&gt;was.....all i&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; used to have fo=\r\nr maa was bhakti...i dint&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; know any mantra nothin =\r\n(not now as well) and i was against on the&lt;BR&gt;other hand&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; .....=\r\nof krishna and ramkrishnadev who were epitome of bhakti...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; at this time....i used to go to my mom&#39;s gurumaatas ashram...once=\r\n in&lt;BR&gt;a spiritual&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; discussion they said..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; get hol=\r\nd of only one ......he/she is antaryami...she understands wat&lt;BR&gt;ur inner&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; needs her...like a\n parent&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; definitely she will ful=\r\nfill them......&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; at the same time....narasimha ji =\r\ntold in one of the&lt;BR&gt;mails........&quot;mother knows&lt;BR&gt;&gt;
