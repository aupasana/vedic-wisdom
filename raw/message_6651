Planets do have some c=\r\nontrol. But, my point is that \n&gt; &gt; astrology as we know is unreliable and o=\r\nne is better off just \n&gt; &gt; surrendering to god. There is something called f=\r\nree will and it can be \n&gt; &gt; used to surrender to god and pray sincerely.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; Reminds me of an incident. A gentleman had a high=\r\n flying career during \n&gt; &gt; dot com bubble, but was struggling for a few yea=\r\nrs. He was from a \n&gt; &gt; distinguished lineage of learned brahmins. I saw the=\r\n horoscope and \n&gt; &gt; suggested Lakshmi homam everyday with Sri Sooktam 16 ti=\r\nmes with only \n&gt; &gt; ghee as the aahuti. I said the remedy will help a lot, b=\r\nut the next 2 \n&gt; &gt; years were very problematic and I wasn&#39;t sure how much p=\r\nrogress could \n&gt; &gt; be made. But I said things would be better after 2 years=\r\n. I told him \n&gt; &gt; to try it nevertheless.\n&gt; &gt; He misplaced the paper on whi=\r\nch he wrote all this down and forgot \n&gt; &gt; about this completely. He continu=\r\ned to struggle for 2 years. About 26 \n&gt; &gt; months later, his wife was cleani=\r\nng the house and found this paper. \n&gt; &gt; She gave it to him. He suddenly got=\r\n inspired and started homam. Within \n&gt; &gt; a month, he got a job and his wife=\r\n too got a job without really \n&gt; &gt; trying.\n&gt; &gt; In the end, one&#39;s well-being=\r\n is in one&#39;s hands. Others can try to \n&gt; &gt; motivate, but nothing happens wi=\r\nthout the internal trigger. Moreover, \n&gt; &gt; doing a remedy with a reasonable=\r\n attitude takes some preparation and \n&gt; &gt; maturing (in the case below, this=\r\n person was reasonably mature to \n&gt; &gt; start with and reading vedic-wisdom m=\r\nessages added to it). Force does \n&gt; &gt; not work in these matters. Make thing=\r\ns available, put out some \n&gt; &gt; inspirational material and leave it to the p=\r\nerson.\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I know you are a very busy professional=\r\n and perhaps have your own \n&gt; &gt;&gt; spiritual path and activities to follow\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes, I am busy professional in high tech and have my own spiritual \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; sadhana too. But this karma - sharings in Jyotish and spirituality - \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; is a *part* of my spiritual sadhana. It is my offering to Lord. One \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nmust share with the world the good things one has access to.\n&gt; &gt; I was touc=\r\nhed when I heard about an old priest. Someone from Vizag \n&gt; &gt; took a copy o=\r\nf our Mahaganapathi homam manual when they visited Boston \n&gt; &gt; and gave it =\r\nto a local priest who is around 75 years old. He \n&gt; &gt; apparently liked it, =\r\nmade 200 copies, distributed at a Vizag temple \n&gt; &gt; and told people to do h=\r\nomam themselves using the manual. This is a \n&gt; &gt; priest whose livelihood ca=\r\nn be affected if people do homam by \n&gt; &gt; themselves. Yet, he was unselfish =\r\nand realized the power of enabling \n&gt; &gt; people on a mass scale and what it =\r\ncan do to individuals and to \n&gt; &gt; society in general.\n&gt; &gt; Those who like th=\r\ne free resources should feel free to spread the word. \n&gt; &gt; But do NOT expec=\r\nt anything in return - praise or acknowledgment. Do \n&gt; &gt; not even expect th=\r\nat the person listens and starts doing homam. Be \n&gt; &gt; prepared for the effo=\r\nrt to go waste and yet put in the best effort. \n&gt; &gt; Act like the most passi=\r\nonate person, but be prepared for any result of \n&gt; &gt; the action - favorable=\r\n or unfavorable! THAT is detached action or \n&gt; &gt; nishkama karma.\n&gt; &gt; *     =\r\n   *        *\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll club the reply to one more mail:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Congrats. He c=\r\nould be lucky but one must not forget that all prayers \n&gt; &gt;&gt; are not always=\r\n answered.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; All sincere and humble prayers are of course always answ=\r\nered. \n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, &quot;you go one step towards god and g=\r\nod \n&gt; &gt; will come 3 steps towards you&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; The only tricky thing is that i=\r\nt may take some time - god waits till \n&gt; &gt; the person first becomes worthy =\r\nof being given something. Surrender \n&gt; &gt; and keep doing the remedy with *fa=\r\nith*. Faith, humility and surrender \n&gt; &gt; are the keys.\n&gt; &gt; Also, sometimes =\r\ngod may not give what you asked for, but what he gives \n&gt; &gt; is always bette=\r\nr for you. Bottomline is this: If you have a problem, \n&gt; &gt; take it up with =\r\ngod. Do it with faith, humility and surrender. Fire \n&gt; &gt; can be a very effe=\r\nctive medium to god.

Exactly how m=\r\nuch effort \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; is needed depends on the individual case and the karmas i=\r\nnvolved. \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; But, things\n&gt; &gt;&gt; like\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; homam and intense meditation ca=\r\nn only help. God either solves one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; problems or creates a situation=\r\n where one rises above the problems,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; i.e.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; does not get affected =\r\nby the problems. If one surrenders and \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; worships god in fire, one&#39;s l=\r\nife will be steered by god in the \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; correct\n&gt; &gt;&gt; direction.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; Though people pay too much attention to many technical details and \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n get worried that they may make mistakes, the most important thing is \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; devotion and surrender and many technical aspects are negotiable. \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nMany people who never even lit a light in their life before are now \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\ndoing daily homam and making brisk progress!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; A lot of peo=\r\nple in serious problems send me their horoscope and ask\n&gt; &gt;&gt; for\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; help=\r\n. Sadly, I or any astrologer cannot solve their problems. \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Solving th=\r\neir problems is in their own hands!! Irrespective of the \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; exact\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nnature\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; of blocking karmas, doing homam or intense meditation can only=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; benefit one. Though people may think that they need an astrologer t=\r\no \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; tell them which deity to worship and otherwise bad things can \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; happen, this is an unfounded fear.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I have studied and experimented=\r\n with astrology (still do) as well as \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; anybody alive today. I can dec=\r\nlare with utmost confidence that our \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; understanding is half-baked at =\r\nbest and one cannot rely on astrology\n&gt; &gt;&gt; for\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; life-changing decision=\r\ns. On the other hand, one can rely on god. \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Gods like Ganesha, Kartik=\r\neya, Vishnu, Krishna, Lakshmi, Shiva, \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Hanuman,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Durga\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; etc =\r\ncan give any material or spiritual results, including moksha. \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Worshi=\r\npping any of them is perfectly safe. Each deity puts a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; surrendered\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; devotee on the correct path, in one&#39;s own way. Each of them is far \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; better than me or any astrologer alive today, for changing your life\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n for\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the better! Picking a deity based on taste and doing homam or \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt; intense meditation is faaaaaaar better than approaching astrologers \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt; like me\n&gt; &gt;&gt; for\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; astrological advice.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; If you a=\r\nre unsure which deity to worship, worship Ganesha with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Ganapathi\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n homam. It is a superb sadhana to set one&#39;s life on the correct path, \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; both materially and spiritually. You don&#39;t have to take my word for\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nit.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The proof of the pudding is in eating it. Try it yourself for a f=\r\new \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; months and see what happens. Your main problem will either be sol=\r\nved\n&gt; &gt;&gt; or\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; your mental state will start to change so that the proble=\r\nm&#39;s impact \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; on you is reduced. You yourself will see how you are bene=\r\nfiting!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Also, there are many insightful and inspiring mails on spirit=\r\nual\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sadhana\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; on vedic-wisdom yahoogroup, which have inspired many=\r\n people to do\n&gt; &gt;&gt; homam\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and other sadhanas.

But, even otherwise, consider \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; sadhana.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; A\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; homam can =\r\nbe done in just 20-30 minutes. Spending 20-30 min\n&gt; &gt;&gt; worshipping\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; go=\r\nd in fire everyday can change your life for the better and \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; transform=\r\n your personality completely.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; In fact, it is Mother&#39;s wish that sever=\r\nal people should regularly \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; worship various deities in fire again and=\r\n progress.

One \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; of the changes is that tho=\r\nusands of simple people will actually find\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;god&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; using fire as t=\r\nhe medium and show direction to many people around\n&gt; &gt;&gt; them.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I am fo=\r\nol and don&#39;t know much, but I know this one thing with utmost \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; confid=\r\nence.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Best regards, Narasimha \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; --------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------- Free \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lesso=\r\nns, Jyotish Writings, &quot;Do It \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homa=\r\nm and Pitri Tarpana: \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAstrologer.org&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms=\r\n.org \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&gt; Spirituality: \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; http://groups.=\r\nyahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wi=\r\nsdom&gt; Jyotish writings: \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWriting=\r\ns \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&gt; Twitter ID: \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n @homam108 ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n Hello Narsimha ji. Pranam. Homams and japams started and the miracle \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; happened. Yes, I started\n&gt; &gt;&gt; doing\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; homams and japams by following =\r\nguidelines from your homam website \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and from your emails on Vedic-wis=\r\ndom list and a real life miracle \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; happened for me. Narsimhaji I bow i=\r\nn front of you. I feel we, \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; whoever, know\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; are so fort=\r\nunate that we got a Guru like you in this world. You are \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a Modern Ag=\r\ne Guru who is enlightening us, showing us direction with \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; all the ved=\r\nic knowledge you got. I had known you for your Astrology \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; wisdom but =\r\nnot that much for Vedic knowledge and wisdom. But now I \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; know that\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; in\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; this facebook and iphone era we have a Guru who can share Vedas=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; knowledge with us and show us right path in this life sitting here =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; in the US. ... This dates back to last year when my wife found your =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; website over the internet and came to me saying she found a very \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; easy way of doing homam by ourselves. She always thought that for \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; all our day to day problems that we were facing in our life, we \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; sh=\r\nould perform some homam/pooja, but we didn=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=A2=C2=82=C2=AC=C3=\r\n=A2=C2=84=C2=A2t know how to do \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that. So when I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; looked at the\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt; link she sent to me I told the gentleman who had written this was \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; our Narsimha guru, and If he was recommending to do homams and \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; wr=\r\nitten something for it, then we should go for it, and for the \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; first =\r\ntime we did homam at our home during navratri 2010. As you \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; know I wa=\r\ns searching for full time job for last 2 yrs, and had \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; failed 17-18 i=\r\nnterviews thus far- I think I had sent you emails a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; couple\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; of ti=\r\nmes seeking some remedies- but you were busy. In 6 or 7 such \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; intervi=\r\news I reached close enough to think that I was going to get \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; an offer=\r\n letter but never got any. ... I started searching Vedic \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; astrology m=\r\nailing list ... I found one of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; your\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; postings where you had writt=\r\nen about hanuman chalisa and then given \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a link for vedic-wisdom list=\r\n. I started looking at that list and \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; read about your experience with=\r\n Manish Pandit, that made me read me \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; many of your postings on that l=\r\nist. ... why couldn=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=A2=C2=82=C2=AC=C3=A2=C2=84=C2=A2t I do \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; intense pooja\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; homams and nullify that effect. I read y=\r\nour comment to surrender to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; one\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; god and worship him same time ev=\r\neryday with full surrender and do \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; homams. I discussed this with my w=\r\nife and we decided to take the \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; route of homam and japams. We perform=\r\ned one homam and I started \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; chanting Hanuman Chalisa everyday with fu=\r\nll devotion, attention and \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Surrender. ... I started doing daily Hanu=\r\nman Chalisa. Everyday I do \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Hanuman Chalisa\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 5/7\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; times dail=\r\ny, and before starting I think about you, Manish Pandit \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Pt\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; XX=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=A2=C2=82=C2=AC&quot;all three as my gurus. I start my ja=\r\npam by telling god that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; if I am\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; honest and sincere, haven=C3=83=\r\n=C2=A2=C3=A2=C2=82=C2=AC=C3=A2=C2=84=C2=A2t committed anything wrong, then =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; god\n&gt; &gt;&gt; should\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; come and l help me out. To my surprise just wi=\r\nthin 15 days, I got 2 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; interview calls. I went and attended interview=\r\ns. The Interviews went \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; well as always, but this time I got the JOB O=\r\nFFERs. Yeah, job offers\n&gt; &gt;&gt; at\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 2 places. It ended my 2 years of stru=\r\nggle, I couldn=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=A2=C2=82=C2=AC=C3=A2=C2=84=C2=A2t believe\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; it. I am\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; planning to join one of them next Monday 20 th June. Hence=\r\n this time\n&gt; &gt;&gt; it\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; was not your Astrology wisdom, it is your vedic wi=\r\nsdom that has \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; helped me. I couldn=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=A2=C2=82=C2=AC=C3=\r\n=A2=C2=84=C2=A2t believe what god has given. It was like \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mira=\r\ncle.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Now I am determined that I would keep doing homams as and when\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; possible\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; but japam daily for sure for my rest of the life. I am a=\r\n novice for \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; homams so I am learning these things. I often see your y=\r\noutube video\n&gt; &gt;&gt; on\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; homams and try to follow this. I hope someday I =\r\nwill get some \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; mastery over this and do homams regularly without erro=\r\nrs. Your \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; experiences and stories with Manish Pandit were very inspir=\r\ning \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; throughout this\n&gt; &gt;&gt; journey.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Your those real time experie=\r\nnces with Manish were great, they gave \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; me credentials that if Narsim=\r\nha guru is writing these things then \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; there should be some truth behi=\r\nnd this. That inspired me that if I \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; surrender to god, god can help m=\r\ne too and he really helped me. This \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; time I had a material motive beh=\r\nind my homams and japams as I wanted \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to get a full time, but I am su=\r\nre this route will take me more \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; towards spirituality and some day I =\r\nwould be able to help society \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; this world in some w=\r\nay. ...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;   &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;htt=\r\np://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
