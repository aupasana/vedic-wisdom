I still did not \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; understand the concept of moksham.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If it is a state of being, wha=\r\nt is that state? Is that state defined \n&gt; &gt; &gt; any where in Puranas? Who\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; found it and being a human why I have to go for it?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I will expl=\r\nain using an analogy.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Once upon a time, there was an ocean. This o=\r\ncean was vast, still and \n&gt; &gt; blissful. Then a force arose within the ocean=\r\n that disturbed it. There \n&gt; &gt; were many waves and ripples on the surface o=\r\nf the ocean. Under the \n&gt; &gt; influence of the force, the ripples and waves s=\r\ntarted moving rapidly. \n&gt; &gt; Instead of seeing itself as a part of the ocean=\r\n, each ripple thought it \n&gt; &gt; was separate entity. Based on other ripples t=\r\nhat it hit it nicely or \n&gt; &gt; abruptly, each ripple started liking some ripp=\r\nles and hating some \n&gt; &gt; ripples. Based on the previous moves, each ripple =\r\nliked moving in some \n&gt; &gt; ways and hated some moves. The ripples developed =\r\ntheir own likes, \n&gt; &gt; dislikes, agendas etc. They pushed themselves to move=\r\n in the way they \n&gt; &gt; liked. When that happened, they were elated. When the=\r\nir move crashed \n&gt; &gt; against the force and they were forced to move another=\r\n way violently, \n&gt; &gt; ripples were depressed. They kept getting elated and d=\r\nepressed, liking \n&gt; &gt; other ripples and hating them, and their likes and ag=\r\nendas kept \n&gt; &gt; evolving.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Some ripples said all the ripples exist =\r\nwithin ocean and hence started \n&gt; &gt; worshipping the ocean. Some ripples pra=\r\nised the power of the oceanic \n&gt; &gt; force that was responsible for all rippl=\r\nes and started worshipping the \n&gt; &gt; force. Some said, &quot;this force is not di=\r\nfferent from ocean. This force is \n&gt; &gt; just a different manifestation of th=\r\ne ocean. This force and ocean are \n&gt; &gt; one&quot;. Some even went further and sai=\r\nd, &quot;why do I look at myself as a \n&gt; &gt; ripple? I AM the ocean. I am a part o=\r\nf the ocean. I AM the ocean.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One day, one ripple realized that th=\r\nere was nothing to like or dislike \n&gt; &gt; in any move. There was nothing to l=\r\nike or dislike any other ripple. It \n&gt; &gt; realized that it was not a  ripple=\r\n, but it was the ocean itself. All \n&gt; &gt; other ripples it was crashing again=\r\nst were also it (ocean) only. The big \n&gt; &gt; force of the ocean that was movi=\r\nng everything hither tither was \n&gt; &gt; unconfrontable and uncontrollable and =\r\none needs to just witness what it \n&gt; &gt; does and not try to control it.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; With that realization, the ripple gave up its agendas to move here or =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; there, its likes and dislikes for certain moves, its likes and dislike=\r\ns \n&gt; &gt; for certain ripples, etc. It just remained there on the surface, but=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; looked at itself as the whole ocean and the force moving it as an \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; uncontrollable force that was moving various parts of it (ocean). Under \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; the impact of the force, it still kept moving here and there, hitting \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; this ripple and that ripple, but it stopped resisting or trying to move=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; in a specific way. It moved for some more time and the ripple died do=\r\nwn \n&gt; &gt; after a while. It merged in the ocean. Before, it thought it was oc=\r\nean \n&gt; &gt; and not a ripple, but other ripples could see a ripple in its plac=\r\ne. Now \n&gt; &gt; that it died down, it was truly ocean and there was no ripple t=\r\nhere.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Other ripples kept resisting the force, trying enforce their=\r\n agendas, \n&gt; &gt; and kept moving hither thither and take a new shape when one=\r\n shape was \n&gt; &gt; dying down. They kept revising and pursuing their agendas. =\r\nThe ocean \n&gt; &gt; simply witnessed them and the force kept moving them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the above analogy, the ocean is known as=\r\n Shiva or Purusha or \n&gt; &gt; Brahman/Aatman. The force within the ocean is kno=\r\nwn as Shakti or \n&gt; &gt; Prakriti or Mahamaya. The waves and ripples are variou=\r\ns deities, demons, \n&gt; &gt; human beings, animals and other beings. The movemen=\r\nt is their thoughts \n&gt; &gt; and actions. Moksha is what is described with one =\r\nripple at the end \n&gt; &gt; (from &quot;One day, one ripples realized..&quot;).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A=\r\nll beings are constantly revising and pursuing their agendas, with \n&gt; &gt; the=\r\nir own likes/dislikes for some actions and likes/dislikes for other \n&gt; &gt; be=\r\nings. They are elated sometimes and depressed sometimes. When one \n&gt; &gt; real=\r\nizes the uncontrollable and unconfrontable nature of the Shakti that \n&gt; &gt; i=\r\ns moving all, one becomes a witness to that Shakti. One may continue to \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; do things to others and exist in the body, but one does not resist the \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; agenda of Shakti and submits fully. One does good and bad things to \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n people without like or dislike for people or for actions. One has no \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nagenda of one&#39;s own. One is in constant bliss. Other people see a body, \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; but one is not identifying with the body. When the momentum is over, one =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; gives up body and merges in Brahman. One is not born again.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I=\r\nf you go through the analogy carefully, a lot of concepts will become \n&gt; &gt; =\r\ncrystal clear - Shiva, Shakti, Shiva-Shaktyaikyata (oneness of Shiva and \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Shakti), jeeva, samskaras, jeevanmukti, moksha etc.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regard=\r\ns,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------\n&gt; &gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish W=\r\nritings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarp=\r\nana:\n&gt; &gt;                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;       Films =\r\nthat make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt;       Spirituality: h=\r\nttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;    Jyotish writings: http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt;                       Twitter ID:=\r\n @homam108\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Wed, Jun 29, 2011 at 3:39 PM, raghs wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nam=\r\naste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have seen people who talks about moksham.
