In the West the teacher simply gives intellectual knowledge; that\nis all. The relationship with the teacher is the greatest in life. My\ndearest and nearest relative in life is my Guru; next, my mother; then my\nfather. My first reverence is to the Guru. If my father says, &quot;Do this&quot;, and\nmy Guru says, &quot;Do not do this&quot;, I do not do it. The Guru frees my soul. The\nfather and mother give me this body; but the Guru gives me rebirth in the\nsoul.\n\nSome years ago one of your Christian teachers, a friend of mine, said, &quot;You\nbelieve in Christ?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; I answered, &quot;but perhaps with a little more\nreverence.&quot; &quot;Then why don&#39;t you be baptised?&quot; How could I be baptised? By\nwhom? Where is the man who can give true baptism? What is baptism? Is it\nsprinkling some water over you, or dipping you in water, while muttering\nformulas?\n\nBaptism is the direct introduction into the life of the spirit. If you\nreceive the real baptism, you know you are not the body but the spirit. Give\nme that baptism if you can. If not, you are not Christians. Even after the\nso - called baptism which you received, you have remained the same. What is\nthe sense of merely saying you have been baptised in the name of the Christ?\nMere talk, talk -- ever disturbing the world with your foolishness! &quot;Ever\nsteeped in the darkness of ignorance, yet considering themselves wise and\nlearned, the fools go round and round, staggering to and fro like the blind\nled by the blind.&quot; Therefore do not say you are Christians, do not brag\nabout baptism and things of that sort.\n\nWe are like moths plunging into the flaming fire, knowing that it will burn\nus, knowing that the senses only burn us, that they only enhance\ndesire. &quot;Desire\nis never satiated by enjoyment; enjoyment only increases desire as butter\nfed into fire increases the fire.&quot; Desire is increased by desire. Knowing\nall this, people still plunge into it all the time. Life after life they\nhave been going after the objects of desire, suffering extremely in\nconsequence, yet they cannot give up desire. Even religion, which should\nrescue them from this terrible bondage of desire, they have made a means of\nsatisfying desire. Rarely do they ask God to free them from bondage to the\nbody and senses, from slavery to desires. Instead, they pray to Him for\nhealth and prosperity, for long life: &quot;O God, cure my headache, give me some\nmoney or something!&quot;\n\nThe fourth and last condition of discipleship is the discrimination of the\nreal from the unreal. There is only one thing that is real -- god. All the\ntime the mind must be drawn to Him, dedicated to Him. God exists, nothing\nelse exists, everything else comes and goes. Any desire for the world is\nillusion, because the world is unreal. More and more the mind must become\nconscious of God alone, until everything else appears as it really is --\nunreal.\n\n-- \nOm Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya\nPrasanth Jalasutram\n\nLove And Love Alone\n\r\n--00c09ffb4c71c6ec030472cfc66f\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family=\r\n:Verdana;line-height:16px&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Discipleship (D=\r\nelivered in San Francisco, on March 29, 1900)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font=\r\n-style:italic&quot;&gt;Volume 8, Lectures And Discourses&lt;/span&gt;=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The=A0&lt;=\r\nspan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;first condition&lt;/span&gt;=A0is that the studen=\r\nt who wants to know the truth must=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;give =\r\nup all desires for gain in this world&lt;/span&gt;=A0or in the life to come.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;The=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;second condition&lt;/span&gt;=A0is th=\r\nat the disciple must be able to c&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;ontrol th=\r\ne internal and the external senses&lt;/span&gt;=A0and must be established in seve=\r\nral other spiritual virtues.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The =\r\nnext qualification is that the disciple must have faith in the Guru (teache=\r\nr).&lt;/span&gt;=A0In the West the teacher simply gives intellectual knowledge; t=\r\nhat is all.
