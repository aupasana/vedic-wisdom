On the other hand wh=\r\nen we imbibe discipline,\ngentlemanliness, cleanliness, oneness of soul with=\r\n others, great character\nand generosity in our day to day life our soul exp=\r\nands so as to encompass\nthe entire world in its very existence. The 3 fold =\r\nendeavor of self\ntransformation, self advancement and self creation rule th=\r\ne roost. Man\ntranscends the binding clutches of greed, avarice, desires etc=\r\n and instead\nuses his soul potential for world welfare activities. Such sac=\r\nred sentiments\nmake an individual great and thus world glory becomes a fore=\r\ngone conclusion.\n3) RELIGIOSITY: True religiosity means adhering to ones ri=\r\nghteous duties.\nOne must be devoted not only to ones family but ethics and =\r\nsocial well\nbeing. Being responsible oneself and not trespassing on the rig=\r\nhts of others\nis true religiosity. God has given every human being certain =\r\npowers. Know\nfor sure that these are not meant for eat, drink and be merry =\r\nway of life.\nInstead this God given potential must be used for ones own adv=\r\nancement and\nthat of society in a befitting manner. Man=92s one and ultimat=\r\ne goal of life\nshould be lading a life of ideals and principles and hence i=\r\nn this manner\nlike a cog in the wheel contribute towards a radiant future o=\r\nf this world.\nThe underlying goal of religiosity is certainly not to bind m=\r\nan in the\nfetters of obsolete traditions and beliefs.

What we fail to realize is that\nequal importance should be given to pur=\r\nifying our intellect, experience and\nviewpoint. In fact true human progress=\r\n is synonymous with soul progress. For\nthis self reflection and self intros=\r\npection are most required. When we\ndeeply understand the true goal of human=\r\n life we slowly get weaned away from\nselfish attainments and instead our ps=\r\nyche starts thinking of world well\nbeing and peace. The more our soul expan=\r\nds so as to merge into the cosmic\nsoul (called God by laymen) means that we=\r\n are marching ahead on the path of\ntrue advancement/progress.
