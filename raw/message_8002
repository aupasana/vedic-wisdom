I urge all Hi=\r\nndus everywhere to give him your full support, assistance, and encouragemen=\r\nt in his crucial work. He needs and deserves our help.&quot; - Vedacharya Sri Va=\r\nmadeva Shastri (Oct. 14, 2007)\n\n\nFrom the Skyscrapers of New York to the Fe=\r\net of God\n\nSri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya is a spiritual master in the ancie=\r\nnt tradition of Sanatana Dharma, a Vedic philosopher, and a Hindu religious=\r\n leader.  He is widely renowned for his unapologetically authentic, traditi=\r\nonal and fearless approach to teaching the spiritual truths of the Vedic tr=\r\nadition. Whether speaking to an audience of thousands, or having a heart-fe=\r\nlt discussion with only one person, Sri Acharyaji vividly conveys a deeply =\r\nmoving sense of personal compassion, peace, humility, integrity and spiritu=\r\nal insight that has endeared him to thousands of students and admirers thro=\r\nughout the world. He is the real thing:  An enlightened and exceedingly qua=\r\nlified spiritual master. \n\nSri Acharyaji was born in New York City. He is a=\r\n European-American of Italian and Spanish descent. Sri Acharyaji has been s=\r\ntudying and practicing the ancient tradition of Sanatana Dharma and Yoga sp=\r\nirituality intensely for over 38 years. He has been teaching the Vedic way =\r\nof life to the world since 1988. \n\nThe dedicated pursuit of self-realizatio=\r\nn and for a direct experience of God began for him at a very early age. He =\r\nchose to follow the path of Sanatana Dharma specifically when he first read=\r\n the Bhagavad Gita, the most important philosophical scripture of the Sanat=\r\nana Dharma tradition, at the tender age of ten. As a philosophically inquis=\r\nitive and deeply contemplative child, Acharyaji then began collecting and s=\r\ntudying a vast number of books relating to Dharma spirituality, Vedanta, Ve=\r\ndic civilization, meditation and Yoga. He also proceeded to intensely pract=\r\nice various forms of Yoga, pranayama (breathing exercises), and meditation =\r\nsoon after this first encounter with the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nAt the young age o=\r\nf 14, Sri Acharyaji formally visited a Hindu temple for the first time. Thi=\r\ns was the famous Ganapati Temple in Flushing, Queens, the very first Hindu =\r\ntemple built in North America. So awed was he with the majestic beauty and =\r\nspiritual power that he encountered in this historic temple that, on the sp=\r\not, he surrendered his life at the feet of Sriman Narayana (God) and decide=\r\nd to devote every fragment of his life to the path of Vedic spirituality. I=\r\nt was at this time that he was first initiated into the Vedic mantra Aum Na=\r\nmo Narayanaya. Soon after this transformative experience, Sri Acharyaji liv=\r\ned the life of a highly disciplined celibate Hindu monk for six years in se=\r\nveral ashrams throughout New York, as well as in the Bay Area, London and I=\r\nndia. Sri Acharyaji was formally ordained in India as an orthodox Vedic bra=\r\nhmana (a spiritual teacher and Vedic priest) in 1986 by his guru, the world=\r\n famous Vaishnava Acharya Bhakti Rakshaka Sridhara Swami. \n\nHis full Sanskr=\r\nit name is Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya. &quot;Dharma-Pravartaka&quot; means &quot;He Who=\r\n Sets Dharma in Motion.&quot; He is known today to his many students and followe=\r\nrs affectionately as Sri Acharyaji. \n\nSri Acharyaji has been working tirele=\r\nssly to &quot;set Dharma in motion&quot; for all of his adult life. He began formally=\r\n teaching Sanatana Dharma, Yoga spirituality and meditation in Chicago in 1=\r\n988, and presently teaches the most authentic and spiritually compelling fo=\r\nrm of Sanatana Dharma and Classical Yoga spirituality available anywhere in=\r\n the world today.\n\nSpiritual Realization Coupled with Academic Achievement\n=\r\n\nIn addition to being an accomplished spiritual practitioner and a globally=\r\n recognized Hindu guru, Sri Acharyaji coupled his personal spiritual practi=\r\nce with a formal regimen of rigorous academic training. Sri Acharyaji earne=\r\nd a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy and Theology, magna cum laude, fr=\r\nom Loyola University Chicago in 1994. While there, he studied the theologic=\r\nal, intellectual and philosophical foundations of Western civilization, as =\r\nwell as the Medieval Scholastic method of philosophical disputation, under =\r\nthe brilliant tutelage of Jesuit (an order of Catholic priests) professors.=\r\n While at Loyola, Sri Acharyaji was inducted into five national academic ho=\r\nnor societies. In May of 1999, Sri Acharyaji earned a Master of Arts degree=\r\n in South Asian Languages and Literature. In December of 2002, Sri Acharyaj=\r\ni earned a Ph.D., summa cum laude, in Languages and Cultures of Asia at the=\r\n University of Wisconsin-Madison, with a focus on Religious Studies and Phi=\r\nlosophy of Religion. His entire academic career from start to finish was fi=\r\nnancially secured by a variety of academically awarded scholarships and fel=\r\nlowships that recognized his academic genius. As a scholar, Sri Acharyaji s=\r\npecialized in Philosophy of Religion, Sanskrit, Vedic Studies, and South As=\r\nian Affairs. He served briefly as an Adjunct Professor with Antioch Univers=\r\nity. \n\nHe has written for numerous academic journals, magazines and antholo=\r\ngies, as well as presented talks at many formal academic conferences, inclu=\r\nding the American Academy of Religion (AAR). Sri Acharyaji has guest lectur=\r\ned at dozens of major universities, including such prestigious institutions=\r\n as Harvard, Columbia, Rutgers, Cornell, Northwestern, and the University o=\r\nf Virginia. He has also served as a religions consultant for many Fortune 5=\r\n00 corporations, including Ford Motor Company, Global Health Corporation an=\r\nd Lucent Technology. In early 2002, just a few short months after the 911 t=\r\nerrorist attacks, for example, Sri Acharyaji was commissioned by Ford Motor=\r\n Company to address over 1000 of its employees as the representative of the=\r\n Hindu religion at a company organized interfaith conference. \n\nExplaining =\r\nvery early on at his first meeting with his doctoral adviser in 1995 that &quot;=\r\nI don&#39;t want to just study the history of religion=85My ultimate aim is to =\r\nmake religious history&quot;, Sri Acharyaji eventually left academia to devote h=\r\nimself exclusively to spiritual teaching and to the preservation of the gre=\r\nat tradition of Sanatana Dharma.\n\nThe Real Thing: An Authentic Guru\n\nSri Ac=\r\nharyaji is currently recognized as one of the world&#39;s foremost scholars of =\r\nthe Vedic religion, the Yoga tradition, Dharma, and meditation, as well as =\r\nbeing one of the precious few truly authentic and enlightened gurus (spirit=\r\nual teachers) fully capable of leading his sincere disciples to enlightenme=\r\nnt. Sri Acharyaji is one of the very few non-Indian spiritual teachers on e=\r\narth today to be fully accepted by both the orthodox Indian Hindu community=\r\n, in addition to the large community of Western spiritual seekers, as being=\r\n a fully authentic and recognized spiritual teacher (Acharya). He is the Pr=\r\nesident and Acharya of the International Sanatana Dharma Society, a world-w=\r\nide movement dedicated to teaching Dharma spirituality. Sri Acharyaji&#39;s man=\r\ny students and supporters come from both Indian and non-Indian communities =\r\nand number in the multiple thousands. \n\nThe form of Dharma spirituality tha=\r\nt Sri Acharyaji both practices and teaches is the most ancient, traditional=\r\n and effective of all Dharma traditions. Sri Acharyaji&#39;s depth of knowledge=\r\n about the Yoga tradition, his authentic and personal approach to teaching =\r\nothers, and his own exalted level of personal achievement in meditation and=\r\n self-realization, have become legendary in the Yoga and Hindu communities =\r\nthroughout the world. Sri Acharyaji&#39;s teachings stress the achievement of s=\r\nelf-realization (atma-jnana) and God-consciousness (brahma-vidya) through t=\r\nhe practice of devotional meditation (bhakti), Yoga, and directly experienc=\r\ning the presence of the Divine. Another overarching aspect of Sri Acharyaji=\r\n&#39;s teachings focuses on the importance of spiritual love, meaningful compas=\r\nsion, and service toward all living beings.\n\nSri Acharyaji teaches the anci=\r\nent philosophy of Sanatana Dharma in a way that is both understandable and =\r\ninviting to the modern mind. Sri Acharyaji has delivered many hundreds of l=\r\nectures, satsangs, and seminars throughout North America, as well as writte=\r\nn countless published articles, on many key aspects of Yoga philosophy and =\r\nDharma spirituality. In addition, he has been the keynote speaker at severa=\r\nl very large national Hindu events, each with audiences in the multiple tho=\r\nusands. In June, 2007, as one example, Sri Acharyaji was the keynote speake=\r\nr at the largest single gathering of Hindus in American history. During the=\r\n &quot;Swadhyay&quot; event in Washington, D.C., Sri Acharyaji spoke to an estimated =\r\n20,000 Hindus about the benefits of Dharma spirituality. \n\nSri Acharyaji wa=\r\ns formally appointed as the Resident Acharya (Spiritual Preceptor) of the H=\r\nindu Temple of Nebraska (2007-2009), which represents the first time in Ame=\r\nrican history that a Hindu temple had ever made such an esteemed appointmen=\r\nt.\n\nHis Ph.D. dissertation, the 408 page The Vedic Way of Knowing God, was =\r\npublished in book form for the public November, 2010, with laudatory forewo=\r\nrds by Professor Klaus Klostermaier and Dr. David Frawley. \n\nHis thus far r=\r\neleased books include: \n\nThe Vedic Way of Knowing God\n\nSanatana Dharma: The=\r\n Eternal Natural Way\n\nThe Shakti Principle: Encountering the Feminine Power=\r\n of God\n\nThe Art of Wisdom: Affirmations for Boundless Living\n\nRadical Univ=\r\nersalism: Are All Religions the Same?\n\nLiving Dharma: The Teachings of Sri =\r\nDharma Pravartaka Acharya\n\nTaking Refuge in Dharma: The Initiation Guideboo=\r\nk\n\nHis most recent book is destined to be his most ground-breaking and revo=\r\nlutionary work yet, the 410 page work &quot;Sanatana Dharma: The Eternal Natural=\r\n Way&quot;, which was published in August, 2011. An all-in-one guide to the worl=\r\nd of Yoga, Vedanta, meditation and Hinduism, this book is a celebration of =\r\nthe tradition of Sanatana Dharma. This magnum opus work is a comprehensive =\r\nsummary of this profound spiritual tradition. It is the first English langu=\r\nage systematic theological compendium (summa theologica) and philosophical =\r\nexposition of the entire world-view of Sanatana Dharma ever produced.\n\nSett=\r\ning Dharma in Motion\n\nSri Acharyaji is recognized by many contemporary Hind=\r\nu leaders as being the most innovative, forward-thinking, dynamic and brill=\r\niant spiritual leader in the world Hindu community today, instigating many =\r\nground-breaking projects designed to preserve Vedic spirituality in its mos=\r\nt pristine form, to strengthen and expand the world&#39;s understanding of the =\r\nphilosophy and culture of Sanatana Dharma, and to teach the life-enhancing =\r\nyogic techniques of the Vedic tradition to all sincere spiritual seekers. \n=\r\n\nClarification of Terminology\n\nBeginning in the late 1980s, for example, Sr=\r\ni Acharyaji began a single-handed campaign to encourage the gradual abandon=\r\ning of such incorrect terms as &quot;Hinduism&quot;, and &quot;Hindu&quot; and to encourage ins=\r\ntead the more proper use of the respective terms &quot;Sanatana Dharma&quot; and&quot; Dha=\r\nrmi&quot;. As Sri Acharyaji explains the issue in his book &quot;Sanatana Dharma: The=\r\n Eternal Natural Way&quot;\n\n&quot;The word &quot;Hinduism&quot; is not found anywhere in either=\r\n Vedic or classical Sanskrit, nor in any of the recognized sacred scripture=\r\ns (shastra) of this spiritual path.  Rather, the proper name of this spirit=\r\nual tradition, the name that is found throughout the scriptures of the trad=\r\nition, is Sanatana Dharma, or the Eternal Natural Way.  Additionally, follo=\r\nwers of Sanatana Dharma are not properly referred to as &quot;Hindus&quot;, but as &quot;D=\r\nharmis&quot;, or followers of Dharma.&quot;  (Pg. 16)\n\nAt the time that Sri Acharyaji=\r\n began this campaign, he was one of the very few Hindu leaders even using t=\r\nhe term &quot;Sanatana Dharma&quot;; almost every other leader of the tradition was s=\r\ntill unthinkingly using the incorrect term &quot;Hinduism&quot;. Indeed, he was initi=\r\nally greeted with a degree of opposition and push-back from many less-knowl=\r\nedgeable Hindu leaders when he first began this important campaign. The sit=\r\nuation today, of course, has now dramatically changed. As of 2012, over two=\r\n decades after Sri Acharyaji began his concerted campaign as a lone voice i=\r\nn the wilderness, multiple millions of followers of the Vedic way have now =\r\nbegun to use Sri Acharyaji&#39;s preferred terms &quot;Sanatana Dharma&quot; and &quot;Dharmi&quot;=\r\n.  More, those very same Hindu leaders who at first challenged the wisdom o=\r\nf re-adopting our religion&#39;s true name are now themselves using the correct=\r\n name with ever-increasing frequency, thus helping to make the term &quot;Sanata=\r\nna Dharma&quot; a veritable household term. We have none other than Sri Dharma P=\r\nravartaka Acharya to thank for this gradual shift in terminology in the las=\r\nt two decades, and for the reclaiming of our spiritual tradition&#39;s true and=\r\n beautiful name:  Sanatana Dharma. \n\nReclaiming Dharma\n\nWhile the term &quot;Dha=\r\nrma&quot; has become an increasingly well-known word in the West in recent years=\r\n, the actual philosophical concept of Dharma has remained little understood=\r\n among most spiritual circles.  Dharma, or Natural Law,  represents the dee=\r\npest metaphysical and philosophical essence of the Vedic world-view and way=\r\n of life. As Sri Acharyaji explains the concept of Dharma in his book &quot;Sana=\r\ntana Dharma: The Eternal Natural Way&quot;:\n\n&quot;The principle of Dharma is by far =\r\nthe most ancient, important, universal, and powerful concept in existence t=\r\noday.  Being at one time in history an ideology whose influence spanned muc=\r\nh of the globe, Dharma represents the most ancient and prevalent philosophi=\r\ncal concept in the entirety of religious history.  Dharma is a weltanschauu=\r\nng [world-view] like none other, because no other world-view has been as lo=\r\nng-lasting, universal in application, and culturally all-encompassing.&quot;  (P=\r\nage 39)\n\nDespite the clearly Vedic origins of Dharma, however, the daily us=\r\ne of the term &quot;Dharma&quot; had severely declined in recent years among most fol=\r\nlowers of Vedic spirituality and &quot;Hinduism&quot;. Indeed, the term &quot;Dharma&quot; had =\r\neventually become so divorced from its Vedic origins that the term has now =\r\nbecome more associated in the popular mind with the later, derivative relig=\r\nion of Buddhism than with the actual religion of its birth, which was Sanat=\r\nana Dharma.  All too many Westerners falsely associate Dharma as being excl=\r\nusive to Buddhism, even though Buddhism itself acknowledges that it adopted=\r\n the concept of Dharma from the much earlier Vedic religion! Sri Acharyaji =\r\nunderstood that, if the world was going to understand the profundity of the=\r\n ancient Vedic path, it needed to first understand the meaning of Dharma as=\r\n the foundational teaching of the Vedic path. The Vedic religion, he unders=\r\ntood, needed to boldly reclaim the use of the term Dharma.  \n\nSri Acharyaji=\r\n embarked on the task of both reclaiming Dharma, and educating the world on=\r\n the deepest philosophical profundities of this fundamental Vedic concept. =\r\nSri Acharyaji&#39;s many writings include some of the most in-depth and intelle=\r\nctually rich explanations of the philosophical world-view of Dharma from th=\r\ne original Vedic perspective available anywhere in any written language on =\r\nearth today. In the last several decades, Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya has=\r\n reestablished the clear understanding that Dharma is, first and foremost, =\r\na Vedic concept. Dharma represents the very essence of the Vedic path.  Mor=\r\ne, Sri Acharyaji has insisted more than any other Vedic guru in the world t=\r\noday that Dharma is a spiritual path that is welcoming of any sincere pract=\r\nitioner, regardless of their ethnicity, language, national origin, or the r=\r\neligion that they were born into. Dharma is not the possession of any one n=\r\nation.  It is God&#39;s gift to all sentient beings.  If we can understand the =\r\ndeepest meaning of Dharma, Sri Acharyaji assures us all, then we can perfec=\r\ntly understand the totality of the Vedic world-view. \n\nRadical Universalism=\r\n\n\nA similar campaign that was designed to re-instantiate authentic Sanatana=\r\n Dharma in the philosophical realm was dramatically initiated by Sri Achary=\r\naji in 2005. It was in that year that his now world famous &quot;Radical Univers=\r\nalism&quot; thesis was first published for the world to see. Originally released=\r\n as a long 44 page philosophical essay, and now rendered in an expanded boo=\r\nk form, Acharyaji&#39;s innovative &quot;Radical Universalism: Does Hinduism Teach t=\r\nhat all Religions are the Same&quot; thesis went on to be read by over one-milli=\r\non Dharmis in its first year alone, and has now changed our understanding o=\r\nf Sanatana Dharma forever. In this important work, Acharyaji explained in a=\r\nn unassailable philosophical manner that Sanatana Dharma never taught the i=\r\nllogical claim that all religions are the same, or that &quot;all paths are one&quot;=\r\n, and that this false proposition is a thoroughly modern and Western notion=\r\n that was superimposed upon traditional Sanatana Dharma for the last two ce=\r\nnturies. Commenting upon Sri Acharyaji&#39;s work, Dr. David Frawley has stated=\r\n the following:\n\n&quot;In his critique of radical universalism, Sri Acharyaji ha=\r\ns boldly addressed this complex issue with depth, clarity, comprehensivenes=\r\ns and sensitivity and, most importantly, with a profound rationality based =\r\nupon the great principles of Vedanta. He shows how the Hindu tradition does=\r\n not teach such a blind equation of all religions, but instead emphasizes a=\r\nn enlightened pluralism that not only allows for the existence of many path=\r\ns but insists that only a path as sharp as the edge of a razor can take us =\r\nto the highest goal.  There can be no compromise about truth if one wants t=\r\no realize the Divine Self within, which is the real aim of all religious an=\r\nd spiritual striving. Sri Acharyaji restores this older and deeper approach=\r\n of the Hindu mind which combines tolerance with truthfulness, and insists =\r\nupon a philosophical clarity to one&#39;s views, regardless of whether others m=\r\night agree or not.&quot;\n\nAs was true with his campaign to revive the Vedic trad=\r\nition&#39;s original name of &quot;Sanatana Dharma&quot;, at first there was a modicum of=\r\n resistance from less-knowledgeable quarters. Today, however, Sri Acharyaji=\r\n&#39;s Radical Universalism thesis is accepted by the vast majority of authenti=\r\nc and more knowledgeable Vedic and Hindu leaders as the philosophical norm =\r\nin understanding the relationship of Sanatana Dharma in comparison to the o=\r\nther religions of our world. Sri Acharyaji&#39;s ground-breaking work on this i=\r\nssue has changed the world&#39;s understanding of the very nature of Sanatana D=\r\nharma. We have Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya&#39;s tireless efforts to thank fo=\r\nr this positive philosophical transformation. \n\nBridging the Gap\n\nSri Achar=\r\nyaji was the very first Sanatana Dharma guru and scholar to write and publi=\r\ncally speak about the unfortunate divide that exists between the two separa=\r\nte Vedic communities of A) Indian Hindus, and B) Western Yoga practitioners=\r\n. Sadly, Indian Hindus and Western yogis rarely communicate with each other=\r\n, have too often found it challenging to relate to one another, have vastly=\r\n different approaches to Vedic spirituality, and have remained two radicall=\r\ny distinct communities. As he has describe this problem in his article &quot;Bri=\r\ndging the Gap: Uniting the Indian Hindu and &#39;Hidden Hindu&#39; Communities&quot;, \n\n=\r\n&quot;The gap between the two communities of Indian Hindus and &quot;Hidden Hindus&quot; [=\r\nWestern Dharmis] in America and Europe needs to be bridged.  Together, as o=\r\nne, united Vedic community - Indians and Americans, Nepalis and British, Sr=\r\ni Lankans and Australians - let us endeavor to exhibit in our own personal =\r\nlives and actions the spiritual qualities that form the very essence of San=\r\natana Dharma, and to work tirelessly together to preserve our common spirit=\r\nual heritage for all future generations.&quot;\n\nSri Acharyaji has boldly proclai=\r\nmed, with an authoritative power that only someone of his spiritual caliber=\r\n can, that Sanatana Dharma is not Indian. It is not American. It is not the=\r\n possession of any nationality or region.  Rather, Sanatana Dharma is God&#39;s=\r\n gift to the entire world. &quot;Bridging the Gap&quot; between these two separate co=\r\nmmunities, with the eventual creation of one, united and global community o=\r\nf followers of the Sanatana Dharma tradition, has been one of Sri Acharyaji=\r\n&#39;s most important projects in the last several decades. In his writings, ta=\r\nlks and projects on this on-going issue, Sri Acharyaji has done more to bri=\r\nng the Indian Hindu and Western Yoga communities to a greater sense of unit=\r\ny than any other guru in the world today.  \n\nWomen Awarded the Brahmana Thr=\r\nead\n\nBrahmanas are individuals who have the qualities necessary to be Vedic=\r\n teachers, scholars, priests, philosophers, and guardians of Vedic culture.=\r\n  To be a brahmana is one of the highest callings in human society. Despite=\r\n this, however, very few in the present-day Vedic community would dispute t=\r\nhe clear fact that the brahmana profession has severely degenerated over th=\r\ne last several centuries to being now only a mere shadow of what it once wa=\r\ns.  Over the last few decades, Sri Acharyaji has taken it upon himself to r=\r\neintroduce the very highest of brahminical standards to the Vedic world, as=\r\n well as to reassert the foundational understanding of what constitutes an =\r\nauthentic brahmana.  Reintroducing the orthodox teaching that a brahmana is=\r\n known exclusively by his or her individual qualities, and not by birth or =\r\n&quot;caste&quot;, Acharyaji has waged a fearless campaign against the anti-Vedic, mo=\r\ndern social perversion known as the &quot;caste&quot; system.  Indeed, he has waged t=\r\nhis campaign against the unjust &quot;caste&quot; system often at very great personal=\r\n sacrifice to himself and his teaching mission. As Sri Acharyaji has explai=\r\nned, &quot;Being a brahmana is not determined by one&#39;s birth, by one&#39;s parents, =\r\nby one&#39;s name, or by one&#39;s so-called &#39;caste&#39;.  Being a brahmana is a callin=\r\ng that an individual person either has the inward ability to follow or not.=\r\n&quot;\n\nIn addition, with the historical degeneration of the original Vedic brah=\r\nmana system, the awarding of brahmana threads to women was also eventually =\r\ndiscarded many centuries ago.  Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya has now active=\r\nly revived the orthodox Vedic practice of the awarding of brahmana threads =\r\nto qualified women.  Beginning in 2008, Sri Acharyaji yet again made histor=\r\ny as the very first qualified Vedic Acharya in over 2000 years to award the=\r\n brahmana thread to Western women, having now invested several of his femal=\r\ne disciples with brahmana threads in orthodox Vedic ceremonies.  As Acharya=\r\nji himself explains his bold actions: &quot;I know that this historic precedent =\r\nis only the beginning of the reclamation of an ancient and important Vedic =\r\ntradition. My hope is that this represents only the first of many thousands=\r\n of women who I will see awarded the sacred thread in my lifetime.&quot;\n\nIn the=\r\nse, and multiple other ways, Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya has proven himse=\r\nlf to be at the very cutting-edge of authentic Vedic revival. Sri Acharyaji=\r\n&#39;s courageous life has been a living testament to what it truly means to &quot;s=\r\net Dharma in motion&quot;. \n\nIf you wish to explore the life-enhancing teachings=\r\n and practices of Vedic spirituality in a manner that is steeped in meaning=\r\nful authenticity and rigorous philosophical depth, feel free to explore the=\r\n teachings of Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya on Dharmacentral.com.

It is a move=\r\nment that is designed to spiritually influence and inextricably transform e=\r\nvery single aspect of the human experience - spiritual, political, cultural=\r\n, economic, scientific, aesthetic, academic and social - to finally free ma=\r\nn&#39;s suppressed inner potential for good. That change will be so thorough, e=\r\nven the way the wind sounds when it blows through the grass and trees will =\r\nnot remain the same. There exists no individual alive, there exists no grou=\r\np of individuals, and there exists no mechanism of persuasion or force that=\r\n can ever hope to stop this movement. To even conceive of stopping this mov=\r\nement would be as foolish as trying to stop the Sun from rising. The Sun of=\r\n Dharma will rise!! Let there be zero doubt: Sanatana Dharma is our future.=\r\n Sanatana Dharma is the future of the entire Earth. Evam Bhavatu. It Will B=\r\ne So.&quot; - Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya\n\n\n\nTHE HINDU WORLD SPEAKS IN ONE VOI=\r\nCE IN THEIR SUPPORT OF SRI ACHARYAJI\n\n\n&quot;You&#39;ve done truly phenomenal work t=\r\neaching the pure essence of Yoga.&quot; - Dr. Deepak Chopra\n\n\n&quot;Sri Acharyaji, I =\r\nam astounded at your knowledge and realization of our Dharma. That an Ameri=\r\ncan would grasp the Divine teachings as deeply as you have is wondrous. You=\r\n are truly a Maha Jagad Guru, the Great World Teacher.&quot; - Sri Swami Brahman=\r\nanda Saraswati\n\n\n&quot;I recommend Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya. He is a notewo=\r\nrthy academic scholar of Hinduism, a formal convert/practitioner as Acharya=\r\n in Hindu temples, and a great public champion of Hinduism with courage to =\r\nstick his neck out.&quot; - Rajiv Malhotra (Infinity Foundation)\n\n\n&quot;You are an a=\r\nwakened soul. May God bless you&quot; - Dr. Ganesh D. Dixit (Department of Mathe=\r\nmatics, University of Auckland)\n\n\n&quot;Hindus need a person of your caliber to =\r\nenlighten them. Hindu people, at this juncture, are looking for someone to =\r\nguide them and encourage them to stand up for Dharma. You are the best suit=\r\ned person in America to guide Hindus in the right direction.&quot; - Narain Kata=\r\nria (President: Indian-American Intellectuals Forum)\n\n\n&quot;In twenty years of =\r\nattending spiritual discourses, I have never encountered a teacher with suc=\r\nh power of authority, complete authenticity and abiding humility. Dr. Moral=\r\nes is the real thing...a truly enlightened teacher!&quot; - Nathaniel Garber, M.=\r\nD.\n\n\n&quot;Sri Acharyaji comes across to me as a very sincere and honest practit=\r\nioner and teacher of Hindu Dharma. Sri Acharyaji is a very devoted, practic=\r\ning Hindu and at the same time, he is very well versed in the academic jarg=\r\non that is so necessary to communicate with his peers in US Universities. H=\r\ne preaches a spiritually oriented, non-sectarian brand of Hindu Dharma, bri=\r\nnging out the deepest truths of our traditions in a very lucid language.&quot; -=\r\n Vishal Agarwal (Director: Voice of Dharma)\n\n\n&quot;Few have the background and =\r\nfewer still the courage to speak boldly about Hinduism in modern times. Sri=\r\n Dharma Pravartaka Acharya has both, and wields them to trenchant purpose.&quot;=\r\n - Paramacharya Palaniswami ( Editor-in-Chief: Hinduism Today Magazine)\n\n\n&quot;=\r\nYou are a pioneer in many ways and you have our congratulations and support=\r\n. If any of us can be of any assistance to you in your work, please do not =\r\nhesitate to ask.&quot; - Dr. Jeffery Long (Professor of Religious Studies, Eliza=\r\nbethtown College, and practicing Hindu)\n\n\n&quot;Acharyaji, your ideas and action=\r\ns have the potential to be revolutionary.&quot; - Niraj Mohanka (Hindu activist/=\r\nresearcher; New Dharma Foundation)\n\n\n&quot;Sri Acharyaji is one of the most info=\r\nrmed and articulate teachers of the greater Yoga tradition in the West toda=\r\ny. He is in contact with the roots of this profound tradition of Self-reali=\r\nzation going back to the mantras of ancient Vedic seers and rishis. He has =\r\na deep understanding of the foundations of Yoga in Hindu (Sanatana) Dharma =\r\nand a special insight into Bhakti Yoga, the path of devotion.&quot; - Vedacharya=\r\n Sri Vamadeva Shastri (Internationally known author of over 26 books on Yog=\r\na spirituality)\n\n\n&quot;Most Respected and Loved Acharyaji. Whenever I read your=\r\n sermons and articles I shed a few drops of tears which fall on the keyboar=\r\nd of  my computer. The Tears are shed due to three reasons. One, because my=\r\n heart becomes filled with bhakthi or devotion to God Almighty. Second, by =\r\nnature I have developed a disposition that whenever I hear or read metaphys=\r\nical ideas, I feel like crying. Third, I am proud that I belong to a great =\r\nor one of the greatest of Faiths in the world, namely, HINDUISM. Thanking y=\r\nou, Acharyaji, with Pranamam.&quot; - \nMuraleedharan Nair\n\n\n&quot;Dear Sri Acharyaji,=\r\n  I came to know about you for the first time through your writings.  I hav=\r\ne read your article on the fate of our Dharma in the U.S. and was overwhelm=\r\ned with joy with such an authentic article.  It is a clear eye opener.  Tel=\r\nl me in what way I can help you for our sacred cause.&quot; - Bhavant Vasudev (S=\r\naudi Arabia)\n\n\n&quot;I come from Indonesia. This morning, I found very good arti=\r\ncles by Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya that allowed me to explore more deepl=\r\ny about possibility to have spiritual experiences, especially to find &quot;GOD&quot;=\r\n through His creation. I believe in Sri Acharyaji&#39;s ability and capability;=\r\n he can see with his &#39;heart&#39;s eyes&#39;.&quot; - Dharma Fitriyanto\n\n\n&quot;When I read ov=\r\ner your words, I was excited to see that the true gems of Hinduism had been=\r\n understood and expressed with such clarity. I found your article, &quot;Does Hi=\r\nnduism Have a Future in America?&quot; to address the pertinent issues with insi=\r\nghtful solutions, which if achieved, would alleviate the danger Hinduism fa=\r\nces today.&quot; - Swarup Swaminathan (Publicity Director - Hindu Students Organ=\r\nization)\n\n\n&quot;Someone of your spiritual eminence is a treasure for all and so=\r\n whatever is in your best interest will benefit every seeker and devotee. I=\r\nn your freedom and spiritual journey is hope for us all. The light of spiri=\r\ntual knowledge is to be shared and not restricted. May the Parabrahman bles=\r\ns you with all you desire.&quot; - Dr. Sanjay Singh (Chairman of the Hindu Templ=\r\ne of Omaha)\n\n\n&quot;Sri Acharyaji, I read your book &quot;Does Hunduism Teach That al=\r\nl Religions are the Same.&quot;  Great book!  I really enjoyed reading it and le=\r\narnt a great deal about myself as a Hindu. Wonderfully lucid. Please keep w=\r\nriting.&quot; - Arjun Rana\n\n\n&quot;Your words are divine, beautiful, informative and =\r\nExcellent.&quot; - M.P. Bhattathiri (Retired Chief Technical Examiner, Govt. of =\r\nKerala)\n\n\n&quot;I have just finished reading your scholarly book on Radical Univ=\r\nersalism. It is absolutely mind-blowing and completely demolishes Radical U=\r\nniversalism without leaving even a trace of it alive. I am amazed at your c=\r\nlarity of writing, the piece also helped me understand the soteriology of B=\r\nuddhism and Jainism. I appreciate your work and request that you write more=\r\n similar books that common Hindus such as me would be capable of reading an=\r\nd comprehending.&quot; - Sooraj Ratnakumar \n\n\n&quot;Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya, I =\r\nam so grateful. I find you as a true Yogi. I read and have forwarded your a=\r\nrticles to the United Hindu Jain Society of Washington DC (I am one of the =\r\ndirectors of it) for further dissemination.  I recommend your analysis of S=\r\nanatana Dharma to be included to the U.S. schools to explain Hinduism.&quot; - H=\r\nari Bindal (Director - United Hindu Jain Society of Washington, D.C.)\n\n\n&quot;Re=\r\nspected Sir, I have no words to express about your excellent articles on Hi=\r\nnduism. You have given a new dimension to Sanatana Dharma. It is marvelous =\r\nwriting. Tears flowed from my eyes after reading your articles. This is ind=\r\need a TREASURE to me.  These articles are written by you because HE is with=\r\n you.  Let HIM bless us also through you.  My saashtanga pranaams to YOU.&quot; =\r\n- V S Rangachar\n\n\n&quot;Sri Acharyaji, I happen to receive your articles on Sana=\r\ntana Dharma and really like to peruse over the contents.

SHRIKANT BHAVE\n\n\n&quot;Namaskar Sri Acharyaji, Thanks for your sel=\r\nfless efforts on behalf of Sanatana Dharma.  I watched two of your satsang =\r\nvideos. They are wonderful.

I am so thankful to God (Krishna) for sending you to=\r\n earth to save hinduism (my religion).  I read the articles on your website=\r\n that talk about how all religions are not equal and it is an excellent art=\r\nicle.  Also, I watched you on the youtube videos which are excellent and I =\r\nam very thankful to you for saving our religion.

Dhanyavaad.&quot; - Vijai Ganapa\n\n\n&quot;Sri Dharm=\r\na Pravartaka Acharya&#39;s dedication to and contribution in the propagation of=\r\n the Sanatana Dharma in modern day America is an example. All the best and =\r\nwith due respect to the Acharya.&quot; - Tushar Ray\n\n\n&quot;Shri Acharyaji has demons=\r\ntrated in no uncertain terms that he is\neminently qualified to be appointed=\r\n to this high office of Acharya.&quot; - Roop Mishra\n\n\n&quot;Kindly accept my very be=\r\nst wishes, Acharyaji, for spreading Universal Dharma [Righteousness] to the=\r\n world community. Hinduism is not a religion but a way of meaningful living=\r\n as it has no barriers.&quot; - V.T. Panchapagesan\n\n\n&quot;Acharyaji, your work is th=\r\ne real Dharma Jagruti. The Vishwa Hindu\nSamanwaya , a body to coordinate Hi=\r\nndu organizations, extends warm\ngreetings on the occasion.&quot; - R. P. Mudholk=\r\nar\n\n\n&quot;Dear Acharyaji. I am impressed with your insight into Sanaathana Dhar=\r\nma. You essentially captured its essence! May the Vaishnava Acharya&#39;s Bless=\r\nings stand you in good stead.&quot; - Ramanuja Dasan\n\n\n&quot;Sri Acharyaji is a highl=\r\ny distinguished and erudite scholar whose interpretations and opinion about=\r\n various facets of Hindu religion are refreshingly novel and convincing. He=\r\n successfully blends the eternal values of the old with the needs of presen=\r\nt day environment.  His work augers well for Hinduism in North America. My =\r\nprayers to the ALMIGHTY to bless him glorious success.&quot; - Dr. N. Bhashyam\n\n=\r\n\n&quot;Yes, the new era for Sanatana Dharma in America and India depends for its=\r\n defense, preservation, and propagation on sages like you, who are the livi=\r\nng embodiments of the wisdom of the tradition. Om Tat Sat. Shanti. With Hig=\r\nhest Regards, seeking your blessings.&quot; - Ramakrishna Rao\n\n\n&quot;Shri Acharyaji,=\r\n I am sure that none will be able to match your outstanding qualifications =\r\nand intimate knowledge of both Western and Hindu culture. May your efforts =\r\nin teaching Sanatana Dharma continue to bear fruit and bless us all!&quot; - Lee=\r\nla Patterson\n\n\n&quot;Once more I would like to commend Sri Dharma Pravartaka Ach=\r\narya for his clear exposition of current problems surrounding Sanatana Dhar=\r\nma and Hinduism. Even though one may not agree fully, the audacity of the\ne=\r\nxplanations and his ability to articulate profound truths in few\nwords with=\r\nout mincing them makes him nowadays a prophet of the cause\nof Hinduism.\n\nTh=\r\nat these thoughts come from a western Hindu, and specifically an\nAmerican o=\r\nne, is quite significant but not surprising. The defect\nthat Sri Acharyaji =\r\ndefines as Impossibility-Thinking is rooted in the\nvery fabric of Hindu soc=\r\niety in India, basically in the upper classes\nand more significantly in man=\r\ny of the influential circles of\nprofessors of famous universities. As the s=\r\naying goes: &quot;in the house\nof the ironsmith=85wooden knife&quot;. A western Ameri=\r\ncan Hindu is above and\nbeyond the inhibitions of class and society in India=\r\n, what\ncorroborates the often-repeated assertion that not only Sanatana\nDha=\r\nrma is patrimony of the world, but that its role in it is far from\nover, an=\r\nd finally that America and American Hindus will play a\ncritical role in thi=\r\ns revival.&quot; - Arvind Sharma\n\n\n&quot;PLEASE EVERYBODY SHOULD READ SRI DHARMA PRAV=\r\nARTAKA ACHARYAJI&#39;S ARTICLES TO KNOW ABOUT SANATAN DHARMA, ETERNAL RELIGION =\r\nAND TRUTH OF VEDAS AND VEDANTA IN THIS UNIVERSE.&quot; - Sunil Maity\n\n\n&quot;Sri Acha=\r\nryaji&#39;s article supports cogent points of Vedanta in a chaste and erudite t=\r\none.&quot; - Vijay Ashar\n\n\n&quot;I admire the work done by Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acha=\r\nrya himself. His selfless strive is towards presenting Hinduism in its true=\r\nst form.&quot; - Dinesh Menon\n\n\n&quot;Acharyaji, Your teachings on Hinduism are incre=\r\ndibly inspiring. Keep up your good work. The rest of us also need to keep o=\r\nur courage. With truth as the guiding light as well as love for and service=\r\n to others as our guiding principles we need to keep moving forward. The tr=\r\nuths of the Vedas belong to everybody, our goal must be to shed true light =\r\non them and educate others. Satyam eva jayate na anritam satyena panthaa vi=\r\ntato devayaanah (Mundak Upanishad 3:1:6). Truth always ultimately prevails,=\r\n not lies; truth is the path that devas, and generous and noble persons fol=\r\nlow and encourage others to follow. With warm regards.&quot; - Sudhir Anand\n\n\n\nT=\r\nhe life-enhancing teachings of Sanatana Dharma are God&#39;s free and precious =\r\ngift for all sentient beings in existence, regardless of their race, ethnic=\r\nity, nationality, gender, or their parentage. Sanatana Dharma is open to al=\r\nl persons who have the ability to surrender to its light with sincerity, hu=\r\nmility, openness and a deep yearning to know God.
