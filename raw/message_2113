Wh=\r\nen the fire starts subsiding i turn the piece upside down to ensure that bo=\r\nth sides burn completely. Sometime the piece crumbles while turning it...bu=\r\nt some solid portion always remains waiting to be burnt. At the end of the =\r\nhavan when the kund is emptied there are generally some slivers of burnt co=\r\nconut left that have not been completely reduced to ashes. i think of them =\r\nas solid hard core karmas/impurities/ego that need dissolution.\n\n:):):)\n\nlo=\r\nve and best wishes\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;ve=\r\ndic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Jiten,\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Yes, as Naraayan replied,=\r\n i too agree and practically i suppose, anybody who does homam needs to do =\r\nthat.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) I am little surprised with this point. i am not facing this p=\r\nroblem my self. very rarely i&#39;ve observed that some coconut pieces are left=\r\n un-burnt.\n&gt; \n&gt; I can point out one prime cause here. It has been observed =\r\nthat if you place coconut pieces where white portion remains up (pieces res=\r\nt on dark side) then there are all the chances that pieces may not burnt fu=\r\nlly. this is my personal experience. so i can suggest few things as under:\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; - Keep Dark side up\n&gt; - Keep the pieces such that they don&#39;t pile on e=\r\nach other.\n&gt; - Keep the pieces such a way that it forms a pyramid shape (to=\r\np of that shape is opened so that Aahuti can be offered conveniently in tha=\r\nt. i mean, there should be a scope for air to pass under the pieces.\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\nt is my experience that coconut peices do get burnt completely.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best R=\r\negards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;naaraayana_iy=\r\ner&quot; &lt;narayan.iyer@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1)While doing h=\r\nomam can we move the coconut pieces that are there in the havan kund, so th=\r\nat they get burned easily.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; i asked it becoz would it be right to poke=\r\n in the fire with a stick while we are actually assuming Ganpati is in that=\r\n fire and the idol at that time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes. You can move the coco=\r\nnut pieces anywhere to facilitate their burning.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2)Almost every =\r\ntime some pieces are left  unburnt, so i do not remove the remains from the=\r\n kund and next time use it as it is and add fresh pieces of coconut.Is it f=\r\nine??\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes. You can empty the ash and keep the unburnt or partially=\r\n burnt pieces for the next homam.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt; Narayan\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
