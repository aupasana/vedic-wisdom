I hope members know basic physics to understand this analogy.\n \nPurusha (also known as Narayana or SadaShiva) is essentially the *potential* energy of this entire universe, while Prakriti (also known as Narayani or AadiShakti) is essentially the *kinetic* energy of this entire universe.\n \nThat way, Purusha and Prakriti are not essentially different and are interchangable, but they do play different roles.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- parijat_d &lt;parijat_d@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Namaste ,\n&gt; Thanks a lot to the learned members for clarifying my doubts earlier.\n&gt;\n&gt; I wanted to know about the essence of the concept of purusha and prakriti.Why is it said that purusha is static and prakriti or shakti is\n&gt; dynamic ?\n&gt; wat is essentially meant by the words..&quot;static&quot;\n&gt; and &quot;dynamic&quot; ??....\n&gt;\n&gt; Lookin forward to hear from u all..\n&gt;\n&gt; With best regards,\n&gt; Parijat Dutta\n\n\n"}}
