Re-incarnation IS real, but identifying one&#39;s last incarnation is difficult. Sri KN Rao collected some data of young people whose past life recollections were independently verified by researchers. He provided the birthdata, deathdata and rebirthdata of some reliable case studies.\n \nI have done some work with it and am interested in all the data I can get hands on. So thanks for your data. More than birthdata of the first life, I am interested in deathdata (date, time and place of death). The last moment of life is an important one. It gives clues to the last thought/desire, which is the foundation of the next life. Moreover, death data is effectively birthdata of another existence, which will end when conception for rebirth occurs. Thus, if death chart is taken as the chart of an independent existence, rebirth (or rather conception for it) should show up as a major major event in annual/monthly charts and transits. I have made some observations before, but more work is needed.\n \nIn any case, this topic better belongs to vedic-astrology list than vedic-wisdom list. I am cc&#39;ing this mail to vedic-astrology. Let us continue this discussion on vedic-astrology if needed and drop the discussion on vedic-wisdom.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J.&quot; &lt;jkoperumcholan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Recently, one early morning my daughter made me, an overseas call, from\n&gt; Australia. She said, she was intrigued with a wierd, vivid, hypnogogic dream,\n&gt; she had had last night.\n&gt; \n&gt; She saw herself sitting on the pulpit of a grave, in a grave yard, and read the\n&gt; following inscribed on the Cross in French: EUGENIE ALEXANDRINE, DIED: ON\n&gt; SEPTEMBER 8TH 1969. She said that name was very familiar to her, though she had\n&gt; never heard of it. On an impulse I checked Wikipedia, and there was a report on\n&gt; Alexandra David-Neel (Eugenie Alexandrine)died on September 8th 1969. She is\n&gt; reported as a French Writer on Bhuddism, with more than 21 important works to\n&gt; her credit.\n&gt; \n&gt; My daughter was born on SEPTEMBER 8TH 1979. There is ten years gap, but some\n&gt; connectivity seemed. Now she is a Dentist with Academic distinctions in French\n&gt; language. She has submitted many research works. She is fond of Budhism to the\n&gt; extent of becoming a Budhist Nun. She has no inclination for marriage or\n&gt; motherhood. There is exact facial resemblance too. My daughter is very\n&gt; spiritual, so keen on women&#39;s liberation, philonthropic, worried on social\n&gt; welfare of humanity.\n&gt; \n&gt; Birth Data of Alexandra David-Neel from 10000 Famous Horoscopes of JHora.\n&gt; \n&gt; D.B.
