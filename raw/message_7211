In the old days, men performed enough spiritual=\r\n sadhana to uplift themselves and their wives too. A couple would operate a=\r\ns one unit. These days, such strong bonding does not exist and men do not d=\r\no enough sadhana. Bottomline is that women cannot rely on men to uplift the=\r\nm spiritually. Except in some rare cases, they are on their own. In my view=\r\n, women are better off performing rituals like homam and tarpana by themsel=\r\nves. There is no injunction against it.
