Even=\r\n the desire to \nprogress spiritually needs to be overcome eventually. How e=\r\nver, to a \nlarge part, having one genuine desire is useful to curb other de=\r\nsires.\n\nThere is no better way to leverage your energies than believing tha=\r\nt \nyou have the energy. In the end, we are no different from the brahman \nh=\r\nimself. It is lack of our realization that keeps us away from the \nlimitles=\r\ns energy/bliss.\n\nThe day one realizes that one is the brahman himself, ther=\r\ne is no \nmaterial interest in using the end less energy one may obtain!\n\nTi=\r\nll then, try to pray to the divine mother to bestow enough energy \nfor you =\r\nto carry on the spiritual journey.\n\nBest regards,\nVijay\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisd=\r\nom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;msbohra62&quot; &lt;msbohra62@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Narshimaha=\r\nji,\n&gt; \n&gt; How to get energy all day and how to regulate personal abilities f=\r\nor\n&gt; maximum performance.Many times we loose both of them.Can you\n&gt; suggest=\r\n,How to get both of them at maximum level by any person?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n M.S.Bohra\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
