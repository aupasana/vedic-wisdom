Many of them tried to offer him presents such as fancy\nsheets=\r\n for his sofa, curtains for the doors and windows, embroidered\ncarpets, etc=\r\n. In order to satisfy the devotees who offered these things, Sri\nBhagavan w=\r\nould usually allow his attendant to substitute for a short period\nof time t=\r\nhe new offerings for the ones which were already in use.\n\nAfter a few hours=\r\n they would be removed and sent away to the ashram\nstoreroom, and the old, =\r\nstill-serviceable items would be brought back into\nuse. Sri Bhagavan would =\r\nbriefly utilize these presents merely to strengthen\nthe devotion of the don=\r\nors. Left to himself, he would use cheap or old\nitems, and never claim that=\r\n they were his own. Devotees who tried to get him\nto use newer or better-ma=\r\nde products could always count on resistance from\nSri Bhagavan himself. I d=\r\niscovered this for myself when I tried to give him\na new pen.\n\nSri Bhagavan=\r\n generally used two fountain pens: one contained blue ink, the\nother, red. =\r\nBoth of these pens were quite old and looked, to me at least,\nworn out. One=\r\n day the top cover of the red-ink pen cracked, so a devotee\ntook it to town=\r\n to have it repaired. It was gone for several days. During\nthis period Sri =\r\nBhagavan reverted to an old-fashioned nib pen which had to\nbe dipped in an =\r\nink pot of red ink. Since this seemed to cause him some\ninconvenience, I de=\r\ncided to get him a new pen. I wrote to a friend in Bombay\nand asked him to =\r\nsend one immediately. A few days later the pen arrived by\npost. I went stra=\r\night to Sri Bhagavan and handed over the unopened parcel\ncontaining the pen=\r\n.\n\nWhenever a parcel or letter bore the name of the sender on the cover, Sr=\r\ni\nBhagavan never failed to notice it. As soon as he received the packet fro=\r\nm\nme, he turned it over and read the name of both the recipient and the\nsen=\r\nder. Having deduced that the parcel had been sent at my instigation, he\ntoo=\r\nk out the pen, carefully examined it, and put it back in the box. He then\nt=\r\nried to hand the box to me.\n\nAllowing it to remain in his hand, I explained=\r\n, &quot;It has been ordered from\nBombay especially for Sri Bhagavan&#39;s use.&quot;\n\n&quot;By=\r\n whom?&quot; he asked.\n\n&quot;By me,&quot; I said, not without some embarrassment because =\r\nI was beginning to\nfeel that Sri Bhagavan did not approve of my action.\n\n&quot;W=\r\nhat for?&quot; demanded Sri Bhagavan.\n\n&quot;Sri Bhagavan&#39;s red-ink pen was out of or=\r\nder,&quot; I said, &quot;and I saw that it\nwas inconvenient to write with the nib pen=\r\n.&quot;\n\n&quot;But what is wrong with this old pen?&quot; he asked, taking out the old red=\r\n-ink\npen which had by then been received back in good repair. &quot;What is wron=\r\ng with\nit?&quot; he repeated. He opened it up and wrote a few words to demonstra=\r\nte that\nit had been restored to full working order. &quot;Who asked you to send =\r\nfor a new\npen?&quot; demanded Sri Bhagavan again. He was clearly annoyed that I =\r\nhad done\nthis on his behalf.\n\n&quot;No one asked me,&quot; I said, with faltering cou=\r\nrage. &quot;I sent for it on my own\nauthority.&quot;\n\nSri Bhagavan waved the old pen =\r\nat me. &quot;As you can see, the old pen has been\nrepaired and writes very well.=\r\n Where is the need for a new pen?&quot;\n\nSince I could not argue with him, I res=\r\norted to pleading and said, &quot;I admit\nthat it was my mistake, but now that i=\r\nt has come, why not use it anyway?&quot; My\nplea was turned down and the new pen=\r\n went the way of all its forerunners: It\nwas sent to the office to be used =\r\nthere.\n\nSri Bhagavan gave us an example of how to live simply by refusing t=\r\no\naccumulate unnecessary things around him. He also refused to let anyone d=\r\no\nany fund-raising on behalf of the ashram. In this too he set an example. =\r\nHe\ntaught us that if we maintain an inner silence and have faith in God&#39;s\np=\r\nrovidence, everything we need will come to us automatically. He\ndemonstrate=\r\nd the practicality of this approach by refusing to let anyone\ncollect money=\r\n for the construction of the temple over his mother&#39;s samadhi.\nThough large=\r\n amounts of money were being spent on it every day, we had to\nrely on unsol=\r\nicited donations to carry on the work. I knew this from direct\nexperience b=\r\necause one day the ashram manager asked me to get permission\nfrom Sri Bhaga=\r\nvan to go to Ahmadabad to ask for a donation from a rich man I\nknew who liv=\r\ned there. Sri Bhagavan, as usual, flatly refused. No amount of\npersuasion c=\r\nould move him from his categorical &quot;No.&quot;\n\n&quot;How is it,&quot; he complained, &quot;that=\r\n you people have no faith?&quot; He pointed to\nthe hill and told us, &quot;This Aruna=\r\nchala gives us everything we want.&quot;\n\nSource: http://www.arunachala.org/news=\r\nletters/1994/?pg=3Dmar-apr\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=\r\n=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--001636c9268be9cfc304882f10fe\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nAs Sri Bhagavan&#39;s fame began to spread, the number of visito=\r\nrs to the ashram increased.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Many of t=\r\nhem tried to offer him presents such as fancy sheets for his sofa, curtains=\r\n for the doors and windows, embroidered carpets, etc. In order to satisfy t=\r\nhe devotees who offered these things, Sri Bhagavan would usually allow his =\r\nattendant to substitute for a short period of time the new offerings for th=\r\ne ones which were already in use.=C2=A0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;After a few hours t=\r\nhey would be removed and sent away to the ashram storeroom, and the old, st=\r\nill-serviceable items would be brought back into use.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;f=\r\nont-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Sri Bhagavan would briefly utilize these presents merely t=\r\no strengthen the devotion of the donors.
