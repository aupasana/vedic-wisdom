The world is a realm of experience where   birth,unhappiness, misery,decay, old age and death are  inescapable for all. It is a universal observation that each one of us are engaged in  some kind of   of activity or the other which  is intented either to increase our quantum of happiness or to reduce our suffering or misery. The Vedas declare that our very essence is bliss. The  moment we try to increase it from external sources, our miseries begin. \nHow  then can we find happiness?  Vedanta tells us that Love towards all and unadulterated  and single-pointed  Bhakti  direct the individuals to look within rather than outside.  The Upanishads and all the treatises on Bhakti  ask the devotee to rest in bliss which is causeless as opposed to artificial pleasure dependent on a specific source.   Lord Krishna advised Arjuna to remain a warrior outside, but a sanyasi within to move in the world, always ready to act appropriately.  There is nothing wrong on our part in our  observing  external events and happenings and their implications with total internal detachment.  Temporary worldly joys and happiness are to be viewed as a distraction from the quest for true  eternal bliss which lies within. In fact a true spiritual seeker would welcome each affliction and soorow as a sort of springboard for a leap into the spiritual world within. I have heard in a religious discourse, that Saint Kabirdasji used to\n pray to Lord Rama to always  give him miseries so that the latter  could always  think of the Lord. \n \nAnother  thought comes to me.  Have any one of us  ever prayed to God for distress? Did we at any time act consciouly in search of sorrow or suffering?  Yet, did not grief and anguish come to us  totally uninvited?  Worldly joys, pleasures and happiness come to us  as a result of our Prarabdha or manifest karma by the grace of God. &quot; Both  happiness and misery come to us by Divine arrangement&quot;, in the words of  Bhaktha Prahlada, in the Bhagavata  Purana.  Lord Krishna describes as how a sage of steady wisdom(Sthithapragyna) behaves in such circumstances,&quot;As the ocaean already flooded continues to welcome  rivers that enter it, the sage of steady wisdom resting in divine bliss, welcomes all worldly pleasure that come come to him by Divine arrangement.  Yet, when the rivers run dry, the ocean remains ever full with water, never missing  them.  Similaraly, the sage of steady wisdom even in the severest deprivation, remains  ever blissful, never craving,\n seeking or even mindful of the absent sensual pleasures. Ananda  is the very essece of our life.\n\n \nG.Balasubramanian\n \n\n\n\n\n.\n \n \n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-2061606583-1251633875=:96561\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; padding-left: 5px; font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wanted to share some of my understanding on&quot; happiness&quot; with you all.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lord Krishna tells Arjuna in Geeta&nbsp; that this world is a place of misery where everything is temporary(ksharam) and where no lasting happines could be found.&nbsp; The world is a realm of experience where&nbsp;&nbsp; birth,unhappiness, misery,decay, old age and death are&nbsp; inescapable for all.
