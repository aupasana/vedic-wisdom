At that time, he ca=\r\nn \n&gt; either do the bad thing to B or resist the temptation again and postpo=\r\nne \n&gt; further.

Eithe=\r\nr A or a substitute will get a chance to pay back that \n&gt; bad karma to B la=\r\nter. If A succumbs to the temptation when he gets an \n&gt; opportunity later t=\r\no pay back, he is back in the cycle.\n&gt; \n&gt; You do something to someone. They=\r\n pay you back. The cycle is done. If they \n&gt; identified with the action of =\r\npayback, it becomes new karma for them. You \n&gt; will again get a chance to p=\r\nay back them again. If you do (and identify with \n&gt; the action), you are ba=\r\nck in the cycle. And so on.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is quite complex. But the key to gettin=\r\ng out of the cycle is: accepting \n&gt; what happens to you, being good to othe=\r\nrs and overcoming ego and the sense \n&gt; of &quot;I am doing&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *    =\r\n    *\n&gt; \n&gt; Karma is not just good and bad things we do to people.

Any action or thought that has some =\r\nforce behind \n&gt; it becomes a karma and gets a reaction from Nature. When yo=\r\nur punya balance \n&gt; is sufficient in a future life, Nature will give you su=\r\nch a car, whether or \n&gt; not you want it in that life!

Nature has created \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; situation where it can be paid back. In other words, Nature has p=\r\nlaced \n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; person in a position to cheat or hurt you and tempted h=\r\nim to do so.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (2) That person has succumbed to the temptation, i.e. =\r\nhe has used the\n&gt; &gt; opportunity provided by Nature. He cheats or hurts you.=\r\n As he engages in \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; action while identifying with the action (&quot;I=\r\n am doing it&quot;), he now gets a\n&gt; &gt; new karma. He will be paid back later.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Both are correct. From his perspective, he is doing it with identific=\r\nation\n&gt; &gt; and he is incurring a new karma. From your perspective, you are b=\r\neing paid\n&gt; &gt; back for what you did before.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In order =\r\nto break out of this cycle, accept it when somebody does \n&gt; &gt; something\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n to you. Do not hate the person or pity yourself. Don&#39;t think &quot;why does it\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; have to happen to me&quot;. Think only about your current action (&quot;what is t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; best thing for me to do NOW?&quot;) and do NOT think about what happened,=\r\n why \n&gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt; happened, who did it and how things happening to you are u=\r\nnfair.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The tricky thing is when Nature places you in a position to =\r\npay back\n&gt; &gt; somebody else&#39;s bad karma and creates a strong temptation for =\r\nyou to do \n&gt; &gt; so.\n&gt; &gt; You may feel a sudden urge from inside to do a bad t=\r\nhing to someone! But\n&gt; &gt; remember one thing. Any thought or action with a s=\r\nense of doership (&quot;I am\n&gt; &gt; doing&quot;) will create a new karma, even if the ot=\r\nher person brought it on\n&gt; &gt; himself with a previous action.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you=\r\n can engage in an action without a sense of doership and \n&gt; &gt; surrendering\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; the action to the Lord completely, you will not incur karma. But that i=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; very very difficult - almost impossible for most. Of course, you can =\r\nalso\n&gt; &gt; postpone the payback through the use of your *will power*, i.e. av=\r\noid the\n&gt; &gt; temptation and not do the bad thing to the other person. As lon=\r\ng as we \n&gt; &gt; live\n&gt; &gt; in a body, some karmas will need to be incurred. But =\r\ngood discretion,\n&gt; &gt; self-control and strong will power will enable one to =\r\npostpone the most\n&gt; &gt; troublesome karmas to a later time.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When the =\r\nreactions to your previous karmas are paid back and through who \n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n not in YOUR control. Nature and the will power of others decide that. So \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; can do nothing except accept what comes. But what you DO NOW is=\r\n to a large\n&gt; &gt; extent under your control.

How you take this push and whether you resist or not has\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; nothin=\r\ng to do with the old action and reaction balance. IF you resist \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; apply some force NOW, it becomes a new action which will get its \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt; reaction\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; later.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Even a perso=\r\nn of a high level of mental equanimity and stability does\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; have an eg=\r\no. Each living person has a limited ego (I-ness) which binds\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; him to =\r\na body and an identity (e.g. PVR Narasimha Rao, who looks like\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; this,=\r\n who knows so and so things, who does so and so things, who wants \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; s=\r\no\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and so things, who is the husband of Padmaja, who is the father of=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Sriharini and Sriharish, who is the sishya of Manish Pandit etc etc=\r\n). \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; If\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the binding is completely removed and one becomes comp=\r\nletely unbound \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that limited sense of I-ness, one will n=\r\no longer remain in the body. So\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; any embodied being must have a limit=\r\ned ego (I-ness). As one dies and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; gets\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; reborn, this ego (sens=\r\ne of I-ness) is cut off from one body and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; environment and re-attache=\r\nd to another body and environment. Nature\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; tracks this change. Just a=\r\ns post office delivers all mail addressed to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; your old apartment to y=\r\nour new apartment when you change address, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Nature\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; delivers t=\r\nhe reactions of all previous life actions to the sense of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I-ness in =\r\nthis life.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; As long as one is embodied and has a sense of I-ne=\r\nss, Nature will\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; continue to deliver the reactions to various previou=\r\ns actions from that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; being. Death of wife in an accident, getting an =\r\nOscar award, losing an\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; election, being criticized by thousand people=\r\n, being hit by wife, being\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; abused by husband, being killed by a brot=\r\nher, being cheated by a friend\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; etc etc are examples of reactions to =\r\nprevious actions. As long as one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sense of I-ness is bound to a bod=\r\ny, Nature will continue to deliver\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; reactions to previous actions. If=\r\n one gets an Oscar award as a result \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; previous good karma,=\r\n it is not necessary that one should be happy or\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; excited or elated. =\r\nDo not think that a reaction from Nature to one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; good\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; karma=\r\n is meaningful only if that reaction makes one happy. How one \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; feels=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; NOW is irrelevant. If one is cheated, it is not necessary that one =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; should\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; feel sad or angry. Do not think that a reaction from =\r\nNature to one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; bad\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; karma is meaningful only if that reactio=\r\nn disappoints him.

How\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; you feel about it now is not relev=\r\nant as far as the old action-reaction\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; equation is concerned. Thus, b=\r\neing equanimous, equal-minded and calm \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; does\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; not stop Nature =\r\nfrom doing its job.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; In fact, it is better that way. By not re=\r\nacting to what is happening \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; now,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; one is preventing new karma=\r\ns. Suppose you cheated a person in a \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; previous\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; life. Suppose =\r\nNature arranged for that person to cheat you now. His\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; cheating you i=\r\ns merely a reaction to your own action (but if he does it\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with self-=\r\nidentification with the action, it becomes a new karma for \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; person. But, that is irrelevant to you). If you just face it calmly and=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; without doing anything, you finish off your karmic debt. Instead, \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; suppose\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; you fight and try to stop the person from cheating yo=\r\nu. Then your \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; current\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; actions would become a NEW karma and yo=\r\nu will have to face its reaction\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; later. If you want to pay off old d=\r\nebts without incurring new ones, you\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; have to behave like the person =\r\nyou described below. Accept whatever \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; comes\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; your way with nei=\r\nther happiness nor sadness, but with a calm and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; relaxed\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mind=\r\n. On top of it, keep doing what seems like the right thing to do at\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nthe moment, with as little self-identification (sense of &quot;I am doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n this&quot;) as possible. As you become better at this, your instincts and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; judgment will guide you better and show you the right action.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www=\r\n.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.=\r\nVedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com=\r\n/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.=\r\n home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Vedic=\r\nAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJa=\r\ngan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Sent: Thursday=\r\n, April 23, 2009 1:02 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: Karma\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Narsimh=\r\naji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; How does one burn their karmas if they are able to b=\r\ne in a neutral\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; frame\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of mind and not be affected by what =\r\nis percieved as misfortune?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; A close family friend of ours=\r\n lost his wife in a road accident a few\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; years\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ago. Her he=\r\nad was crashed into a pulp right before his eyes. He very\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; calmly p=\r\nicked her up, took her to the hospital and took care of all \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; his\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; duties towards her and the family. His wife was a very =\r\nspiritual \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; person\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and so is he. Right before the accident=\r\n, his wife told him of her\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; recent\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; meditation experience a=\r\nnd that she would probably be leaving her body\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; soon. her husband n=\r\never shed a tear and was in the utmost calm and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cheerful frame of =\r\nmind even during the funeral process. Some folks \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; felt\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to be a bit odd. He is a highly educated professor with a stable =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; mind.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; His\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; wife and he shared a very high spirit=\r\nual and mental bond and they \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; two\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; teenage s=\r\nons. I have the utmost reverance towards him and also in awe\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; his spiritual level. My question is how would his karmas be burnt if=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; never feels the pain of such a perceived tragedy?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;name deleted for privacy&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
