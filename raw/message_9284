I read from your Homam manual that #1 mantra has been mentioned=\r\n there, but is there anything wrong in the other three?\n\nI also have someth=\r\ning in my mind. I tend to think that mantras which are taken from the scrip=\r\ntures &quot;exactly as it is&quot; are and work the best. As an example from Rudram c=\r\nomes two mantras\n\n1. Om Namo Bhagavate Rudraya\n2. Om Namah Shivaya\n\nThat is=\r\n why we say &quot;Om Namah Shivaya&quot; and not &quot;Om Shivaya Namah&quot;... so am I right =\r\nhere that its the best to chant mantras as exactly taken from the scripture=\r\ns (Without making any changes to them) and in that context what Ganesha man=\r\ntra can I chant.\n\nThanks\nTanvir\n\n\n"}}
