But=\r\n, as sadhana matures, people may rise out of them.\n \nTake the simple exampl=\r\ne of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. When Kaali temple was inaugurated at Dakshine=\r\nshwar, his brother joined as a priest in Kaali temple and he joined as a pr=\r\niest in Krishna temple. Because the temple was constructed by Rani Rasmani,=\r\n a lower caste person, Ramakrishna considered the prasad to be unsuitable f=\r\nor his consumption! Though Rani Rasmani had donated the temple to her famil=\r\ny priest formally and the temple was formally owned by a brahmana so that r=\r\nigid caste rules of the day were satisfied and brahmanas could accept food =\r\nthere, Ramakrishna was too orthodox and was not satisfied by the arrangemen=\r\nt. He chose not to accept the prasad at the temple. Instead, he cooked for =\r\nhimself everyday while maintaining external purity (i.e. ganges bath before=\r\n cooking and all that).\n \nBut, didn&#39;t he transform into a highly tolerant a=\r\nnd open-minded saint who shunned orthodoxy? He became so pure that his word=\r\ns were drenched in the nectar or self-realization and were like a modern up=\r\nanishad.\n \nInterestingly, Ramakrishna later said that Rani Rasmani was an i=\r\nncarnation of one of the eight associates of goddess Durga herself! Yet, sh=\r\ne was not good enough for him earlier and he could not eat prasad served at=\r\n her temple (though he could work there!).\n \nGive people who are faithfully=\r\n following *some* rules, however illogical they may sound to you, a chance.=\r\n Do not look for the bad things in them. Learn to tolerate the bad or just =\r\navoid them if you cannot tolerate. Transform if you can, fight if you reall=\r\ny have to and ignore otherwise. Accumulating frustration and anger is unpro=\r\nductive.\n \nBest regards\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, J=\r\nyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri =\r\nTarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that m=\r\nake a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://group=\r\ns.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n--------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------\n \n---- Rudra Aksha &lt;aksha.rudra@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n Shri Narsimhaji\n&gt; Thanks for your inputs.\n&gt; I too belive that close minded=\r\nness is acceptable but (with a view)if I while walking on my paths tell to =\r\nothers that my path is superior than yours,it is a sin !Same happens with I=\r\nskonites where they sometimes dont belive that Shri Krishna was an avatara =\r\nof Shri Hari and ...............better not to speak much on this divine day=\r\n of Tulsi Vivah.\n&gt; Actual example I am giving you,I know many vaishnavas wh=\r\no simply say NO NO when someone offer them prasadam,do this happens with ot=\r\nher paths?(mostly not)\n&gt; And I have also seen many Vaishnavas who are reall=\r\ny keen to help others and in my views they are the real devotees of Shri Ha=\r\nri/Shri Krishna,Vaishana should be simple and nirmal with no egos(Recall Gu=\r\njarati famous Bhajan which Mahatma Gandhi loved too much)=C2=A0and this is =\r\ntheir first sign of being a vaishnava,see an example of=C2=A0 ShriMeerabai =\r\nand Shri NarsinhMehta or even Shri Hanumanji.Troubles should end once they =\r\nrealise your line &quot;Vishnu&#39;s incarnations such as Rama and Krishna worshippe=\r\nd Shiva&quot;.\n&gt; Many of them consider Shri ShivaMahapurana filled with Tamasic =\r\ntaste-well no comments I want to make on them who are tasteless !

Shiva and Vishnu h=\r\nad unconditional love and devotion for each other. They are not like normal=\r\n human beings and their relationships, such as love and devotion, are not g=\r\noverned by petty notions of superiority and dependence.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Shaivite-Va=\r\nishnavite distinctions and the biases of Kali yuga are unfortunate. Neverth=\r\neless, I am willing to tolerate biases and closed-mindedness. Closed-minded=\r\nness is ok as long as one is making some progress with one&#39;s own belief sys=\r\ntem.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; One climbing a mountain has to choose one of the availab=\r\nle paths. Whether one acknowledges that several mountain paths lead to the =\r\nmountain top or whether one believes that only the path one has chosen lead=\r\ns to the top, is not that important. As long as one is climbing the mountai=\r\nn in one&#39;s chosen path, one is doing alright!\n&gt;\n&gt; After all, there may be m=\r\nany paths around the hill. One may be unable to see paths on the other side=\r\n of the mountain or even distant paths on the same side. If one does not th=\r\nink much of those paths and focuses on climbing in one&#39;s own path, that doe=\r\ns no harm.\n&gt;\n&gt; As one reaches the top, it gets narrower and one may see the=\r\n other paths that seemed quite distant earlier to be quite nearby now. As o=\r\nne is very close to the top, one will see that all paths are leading there.=\r\n When one is on the top, one sees all paths to converge there. After god-re=\r\nalization, one sees various paths to be valid paths to god. Of course, diff=\r\nerent paths come with different obstacles. One path may have some snow. One=\r\n path may be too steep. One path may be slippery. One path may have falling=\r\n rocks. One path may have fallen trees blocking it. And so on. But, one on =\r\nthe top knows that people can reach there using several paths, if they are =\r\ncommitted to overcoming the obstacles and reaching the top.\n&gt;\n&gt; Let people =\r\nfollow the paths chosen by them and wish them good luck to reach the top in=\r\n their own paths. Let them say whatever they want to say about your path. I=\r\nt does not matter. If YOU have conviction and faith, you just walk your pat=\r\nh and reach the top!\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; The problem is that some people are doin=\r\ng no sadhana really, making no progress really and yet passing judgments on=\r\n other paths and getting into fights. They are like people at the base of t=\r\nhe mountain, trying to block people from some paths and trying to enroll th=\r\nem in their path. They may fight with people and kill them too. They stay a=\r\nt the base forever and never reach the top. They are a problem.\n&gt;\n&gt; But, pe=\r\nople with narrow views who do some sadhana and make progress are ok. They a=\r\nre on some path and will eventually reach god. For example, so many Krishna=\r\n bhaktas who look down upon Shiva as a lower demigod may be doing their man=\r\ntra several malas a day with a good level of devotion and they will eventua=\r\nlly make progress. I know Vaishnavas in some sampradayas who do not even wo=\r\nrship Ganesha as he is &quot;from Shiva&#39;s family&quot; and worship Vishvaksena at the=\r\n start of their poojas instead of Ganesha. But, they do no harm to anyone, =\r\ntry to see all human beings as Vishnu&#39;s forms, try to serve all and keep th=\r\neir austerities. Bottomline is that they are doing some sadhana and will ev=\r\nentually make progress.\n&gt;\n&gt; Let us not worry about people who are doing som=\r\ne sadhana and progressing. Any deficiencies in their understanding will be =\r\naddressed in due course.\n&gt;\n&gt; The bottomline is: Keep doing enough sadhana t=\r\no burn the conditioning and keep making progress.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Naras=\r\nimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free Jy=\r\notish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; =\r\nritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrolo=\r\nger.org\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; Spiritu=\r\nality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; --------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I hardly disagree with your views but for =\r\nIskcon I have my own thoughts,no doubt on Shri Prabhupada and his mission t=\r\no spread Shri Krishna&#39;s awareness but many times(After exit of Shri Prabhup=\r\nada)on numerous occasions I found their views very biased towards Shri Shiv=\r\nji and for that reason I have my reservations and those views of mine are n=\r\not my own views as some senior ex-Iskconites too share same views like me.I=\r\nf I am allowed to speak I have seen very few shivites speaking hard stuff l=\r\nike them for opposite side.(Shri Hari or Shri Krishna),not even that well k=\r\nnown astrologer Sanjay Rath once posted a separate procedures for Vaishnava=\r\ns to do Mahamrityunjaya japam using Shri Veda Vyasa&#39;s name instead of Shri =\r\nVasishtha mantra(Vam Vasishthaya Namah) !

If you see an elephant carefully, your mind may be able to captu=\r\nre all of its details well. If you read thousands of books on an elephant w=\r\nithout having ever seen one, you may still not be able imagine an elephant.=\r\n Moreover, you may find different books to be contradictory. You may like s=\r\nome and dislike some based on your own biases about what an elephant looks =\r\nlike. If you see an elephant yourself oneday, you will realize then that bo=\r\noks that seemed contradictory once are not that contradictory after all.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Srila Prabhupada was undoubtedly a great saint. To go abroad without =\r\neven knowing anyone there at an advanced age to spread Krishna bhakti, to r=\r\noam New York streets without proper shoes or clothing in winter, requires t=\r\nremendous surrender. Based on previous samskaras, some may not be attracted=\r\n to his interpretations. But that does not take away anything from them.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; My personal favorite is Lord Jnaneshwar&#39;s take on Bhagavad Gita and I=\r\n also like Aadi Shankara&#39;s commentary overall. However, Srila Prabhupada&#39;s =\r\ncommentary is fine too and it is perfect for people with certain samskaras.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sophisticated and complicated Upanishadic ideas are not palatable =\r\nto everyone. They need to be simplified. Especially, people from monotheist=\r\nic belief systems and subscription based religions need simpler models of d=\r\nivinity. So Upanishads and scriptures need to be interpreted so as to be pa=\r\nlatable to them. So many great saints came and interpreted scriptures sligh=\r\ntly differently, because there are different groups of people with differen=\r\nt samkaras waiting to be guided by them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My philosophy is simple. R=\r\nead what appeals to you. Follow what you are able to. But, in the end, read=\r\ning tomes about elephant are only the starting point.

If a priest is conducting the ritual, he may be affected by the =\r\nspillage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the old days, priests did intense sadhana and =\r\ngenerated enough purity to handle such things. Many priests of today do not=\r\n do enough penance. They are quite vulnerable as they start messing with ot=\r\nher people&#39;s karmas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Secondly, many priests of today who co=\r\nnduct poojas are not really brahmanas. Being born to a brahmana father is n=\r\neither necessary nor sufficient for one to become a brahmana oneself. One&#39;s=\r\n aptitude, attitude and actions have to be brahmana-like. Many brahmanas to=\r\nday think of power and influence over others or of money or of comforts. Th=\r\ney are not thinking just of knowledge and liberation. They are not really b=\r\nrahmanas. In fact, there are very very few brahmanas on earth right now. Sh=\r\nastras are clear that rituals can be performed for others only by brahmanas=\r\n. What it means is that one desirous of power, influence, money and comfort=\r\ns is unfit to perform rituals for others.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is there any re=\r\nmedy for this?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, stop doing rituals for others. Or, do =\r\nenough individual penance when you are not doing rituals for others. Moreov=\r\ner, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapt=\r\ner 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahmana by overcoming the tendencies=\r\n of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding mail 2 below on astrologers:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is n=\r\not an immature comment and there is an element of truth in it. A lot of wha=\r\nt I said above applies here too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Every action performed wit=\r\nh ego (a sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;) produces an equal reaction. If an astr=\r\nologer&#39;s action of giving advice to someone resulted in that person doing X=\r\n instead of Y at kaarmik crossroads and experiencing Z instead of W in comi=\r\nng years, there is clearly an action here. If the astrologer has some sense=\r\n of &quot;I am doing this&quot;, then one is bound to experience the fruits of it. So=\r\nme blessings can come and some sufferings can come too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mes=\r\nsing with someone else&#39;s karmas is always a risky business.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n What is the solution? Well, become a true brahmana. Again, try to follow a=\r\n brahmana lifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire=\r\n to truly become a brahmana by overcoming tendencies of chandalas, shudras,=\r\n kshatriyas and vaisyas. Irrespective of where one was born and brought up,=\r\n one will become a brahmana if one follows this. Only brahmanas are qualifi=\r\ned to play with the karmas of others by giving life-altering advice or by c=\r\nonducting rituals. Again, to be clear, I am not talking about brahmanas by =\r\nbirth, but about brahmanas by conduct.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The above will becom=\r\ne clear, if you look at the criteria laid about by Parasara, Varahamihira e=\r\ntc on who can be taught Jyotish!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nara=\r\nsimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textboo=\r\nk,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri T=\r\narpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a di=\r\nfference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yah=\r\noo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mail 1:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- &quot;aksha.rudra&quot; &lt;=\r\naksha.rudra@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are present Brahmanas suffering fro=\r\nm any curse(Shapam)?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This I am asking after seeing the overall an=\r\nd general condition of Brahmanas specially those who do pujas for Yajmanas =\r\nand involved in Karmakanda.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And if this is true is there any reme=\r\ndy for this?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think this is the only place where we can discuss =\r\nthis subject hence I am posting this query here.Thanks a lot in advance.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mail 2:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, =\r\n&quot;rl_yhoo&quot; &lt;rl_yhoo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimhaji and other educ=\r\nated Scholars,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have just started listening to your (N=\r\narasimhaji&#39;s) mp3 training sessions and am very eager to review my own char=\r\nt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However in numerous instances in the past, I&#39;ve hear=\r\nd through friends and close uncles that astrology can have a severe adverse=\r\n impact on yourself (astrologer) and yrou family. This may sound a very imm=\r\nature comment, but I thought I should get your opinion / thoughts on this b=\r\nefore I proceed on this journey.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would appreciate get=\r\nting a honest response so I can put this issue to rest once and for all.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Raj\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PS: I am drawn=\r\n to astology more from an academic perspective of how it influences our lif=\r\ne and how ignorant we are of this power around us. My goal is to get the li=\r\nttle understanding that I can of this marvelous science and educate our nex=\r\nt generation so they are not blinded by modern society and develop / retain=\r\n respect for astrology and our culture.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
