This informa=\r\ntion is very valuable.\n \nI want to make a critical comment on an astrologic=\r\nal factor mentioned below. Please forgive me if this is out of line.\n \n&gt; It=\r\n is even more interesting that this Ashtami falls on the star\n&gt; Swati. The =\r\nruling planet of the stars Tiruvadirai, Swati and\n&gt; Sadayam is Rahu. The Go=\r\nddess who rules over Rahu is the\n&gt; all-powerful Goddess Durga Parameswari.\n=\r\n \nIt is simplistic to use planetary associations of nakshatras like this. T=\r\nhough a lot of people say things like this, such thinking is incorrect and =\r\nrelatively modern. Rahu owns Swathi only as per the Vimsottari dasa scheme.=\r\n Maharshi Parasara taught tens of dasa schemes, though people ignore all th=\r\nose now. For example, the ruling planet of Swathi nakshatra is Mars as per =\r\nAshtottari dasa, Venus as per Shodasottari dasa, Sun as per Yogini dasa, Me=\r\nrcury as per Shat-trimsa sama dasa, Sun as per Chaturaseeti sama dasa, Moon=\r\n as per Sataabdika dasa and so on. Then why take Rahu only?\n \nRuling planet=\r\ns of nakshatras based on specific dasa schemes like Vimsottari are not of m=\r\nuch importance. Ruling deities of nakshatras taught by rishis in nakshatra =\r\nsooktam are far more important.\n \nFor example, Sravana nakshatra is conside=\r\nred auspicious for Vishnu pooja. It is not because Moon is the ruling plane=\r\nt of Sravanam. It is because Vishnu is the ruling deity of Sravanam as per =\r\nnakshatra sooktam. Suryopanishat says &quot;yo hastaaditye japati sa mahaamrityu=\r\nm tarati&quot; (whoever chants this when Sun is in Hasta nakshatra crosses death=\r\n). As per Vimsottari ruling planets, Hasta is owned by Moon. However, that =\r\nis immaterial. The actual reason is that Hasta is ruled by Savita (a form o=\r\nf Sun) as per nakshatra sooktam. That is why it is important for Sun&#39;s wors=\r\nhip. Though the ruling planet of both Asresha and Revati is Mercury, the fo=\r\nrmer is considered very inauspicious for most activities and the latter is =\r\nauspicious. It is because its ruling deity of the former is Sarpa (snake) a=\r\nnd the latter is Pooshan as per nakshatra sooktam.\n \nWe should get out of t=\r\nhe habit of paying attention to the Vimsottari dasa ruling planets of naksh=\r\natras and instead pay attention to the nakshatra sookta ruling deities. The=\r\n former is of no significance.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------\nDo Ganapathi Homam Yoursel=\r\nf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.co=\r\nmcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nS=\r\nri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n  ----- Original Me=\r\nssage ----- \n  From: Saravanan Balaraman \n  To: sivacharya@yahoogroups.com =\r\n\n  Sent: Thursday, March 06, 2008 10:29 AM\n  Subject: [sivacharya] Vrata Da=\r\nys and Phalas - English Translation\n\n\n  Namaskar.\n\n            This is the =\r\nEnglish translation of Weekly Vrata Days/Phalas by Shri Shanmukha Sivachary=\r\nar on Sun TV every Sunday. Shri Deepa has taken lots of pains to make this =\r\navailable for us. Also we will be attaching this as a word document in our =\r\nfiles section.\n\n  Vanakkam\n  Saravanan\n\n\n  28 Jan 2008, Monday. Krishna Pak=\r\nsha Shashti Vratam\n\n\n\n  This day falls on the 14th day of the Tamil month T=\r\nhai, on a Monday. On this day, one must observe the Krishna Paksha Shashti =\r\nVratam. As we&#39;ve seen already, Krishna Paksha is the waning fortnight.  Sha=\r\nshti means the sixth day.\n\n\n\n  Monday, called Soma vaara, is significant be=\r\ncause it is a day when the all-powerful Lord Shiva is one with his Shakti U=\r\nma. It is &quot;Sa + Uma&quot; vaara, hence Soma Vaara. \n\n\n\n  If you remember, we alr=\r\neady realized that out of the six faces of Lord Muruga, five faces are Lord=\r\n Shiva&#39;s and one face is the face of Ambal. He thus signifies the union of =\r\nShiva and Shakti.\n\n\n\n  Thus, the day of Lord Muruga on Shashti, coinciding =\r\nwith a Soma Vaara is especially auspicious.\n\n\n\n  They say, &quot;Sattiyil irundh=\r\naal thaan agappaiyil varum&quot; - It actually means that if one observes the vr=\r\natam on Shashti, the Grace of Lord Muruga will bless her with progeny. We a=\r\nlso believe that a family gets every prosperity and Sowbhagya by worshippin=\r\ng Lord Muruga. \n\n\n\n\n\n  30 Jan 2008, Wednesday. Ashtami Vratam\n\n\n\n  This day=\r\n falls on the 16th day of the Tamil month Thai, on a Wednesday. On this day=\r\n, one must observe the Ashtami Vratam.  We saw earlier that Ashtami means t=\r\nhe eighth day. This day is especially auspicious for the propitiation of Go=\r\nddess Durga, Lord Muruga and Lord Bhairava. Also, Ashtami and Chaturdashi t=\r\nithis are said to be the best days for the performance of abhisheka to Lord=\r\n Shiva.\n\n\n\n  It is even more interesting that this Ashtami falls on the sta=\r\nr Swati. The ruling planet of the stars Tiruvadirai, Swati and Sadayam is R=\r\nahu. The Goddess who rules over Rahu is the all-powerful Goddess Durga Para=\r\nmeswari. One must make an effort to visit any neighbouring temple and offer=\r\n prayers to Goddess Durga on this doubly significant day. \n\n\n\n  `Durgam&#39; me=\r\nans grief or kashtam. By propitiating Goddess Durga Parameswari, it is our =\r\nbelief that we will be freed from all misery and grief, and be blessed with=\r\n every prosperity and happiness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n  02 Feb 2008, Saturday. Sa=\r\nrva Ekadashi\n\n\n\n  This day falls on the 19th day of the Tamil month Thai, o=\r\nn a Wednesday. On this day, one must observe the Sarva Ekadashi Vratam.  It=\r\n is significant that this Ekadashi falls on a Saturday. This Ekadashi is ca=\r\nlled Saphala Ekadashi. What does `Saphala&#39; mean? `Phala&#39; means fruit - ever=\r\ny action that we do is directed towards achieving an objective. The shastra=\r\ns say, &quot;Nakuryaat nishphalam karma,&quot; which means, do not do that action tha=\r\nt does not result in any fruit. \n\n\n\n  Yes, Lord Krishna says, do not `expec=\r\nt&#39; the fruits of your action. This is different from the action not resulti=\r\nng in any fruit at all. The shastra here says that every action should be p=\r\nerformed in order to achieve some end result, which is the phalam or fruit =\r\nof that action. Lord Krishna says we must not claim ownership of this actio=\r\nn. \n\n\n\n  For e.g., gossiping about someone unnecessarily, banging the table=\r\n without purpose, sitting idly, etc. are actions that are fruitless. If you=\r\n entrust an activity with someone, and he does not do justice to it, will y=\r\nou trust him again with the same activity?  No. Similarly, the time on eart=\r\nh has been given to us for a reason. The Lord has blessed us with this life=\r\n so we may lead a rich and fulfilling life and we must do justice to this t=\r\nime given to us.\n\n\n\n  The Saphala Ekadashi bestows upon us all the fruits r=\r\nequired to lead a fulfilling life. Since it also falls on a Saturday, which=\r\n we have seen is the Stithikarakan and the day of Lord Vishnu, the very Lor=\r\nd whom we pray to on this day, it is our belief that He will grant every bl=\r\nessing required for our lives on this day.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n  04 Feb 20=\r\n08, Monday. Soma Maha Pradosham\n\n\n\n  This day falls on the 21st day of the =\r\nTamil month Thai, on a Monday. On this day, one must observe the Soma Maha =\r\nPradosha Vratam.  Pradosha, as seen earlier, is &quot;Pra + dosha&quot; - a time when=\r\n even the most wicked evil can be removed. This is even more powerful as it=\r\n falls on a Monday. \n\n\n\n  This is called Yogam. A zero next to one, makes i=\r\nt ten. If you add another zero next to it, it now becomes hundred. Things g=\r\net value by what they are associated with. Similarly, when pradosham is ass=\r\nociated with a Monday, it becomes even more significant. \n\n\n\n  Shivam itsel=\r\nf means mangalam, all goodness personified. It is our belief that we will a=\r\nttain every kind of mangalam in our lives, by offering prayers at a neighbo=\r\nuring Shiva temple on this day. \n\n\n\n  06 Feb 2008, Wednesday. Thai Amavasya=\r\n, Sravana Vratam\n\n\n\n  This day falls on the 23rd day of the Tamil month Tha=\r\ni, on a Wednesday. On this day, one must observe the Thai Amavasya Vratam. =\r\n &quot;Vratam&quot; means to control. It is something that disciplines us. Why is it =\r\nsignificant on an Amavasya? Amavasya is a day for our Pitru - ancestors. Wh=\r\nether one worships the Lord or visits the temples, it does not matter - one=\r\n must worship one&#39;s parents while they are alive. \n\n\n\n  What does worship m=\r\nean? Making them sit and offering flowers? No, that&#39;s not the only meaning =\r\nof worship. It also means to care for them in the best possible way. But fo=\r\nr them, we wouldn&#39;t be here - be it a millionaire or a pauper, we all need =\r\nparents to enter this world. Our parents are verily, the Lord Incarnate. Th=\r\ne Vedas say, &quot;Matru Devo Bhava; Pitru Devo Bhava.&quot; It exhorts us to see our=\r\n mother and our father as the very God in flesh and blood. This is echoed b=\r\ny the Tamil saying we are all familiar with since childhood,  &quot;Annaiyum Pit=\r\nhavum Munnari Deivam.&quot;  Our parents are the first Gods we are aware of. \n\n =\r\n So we must take good care of them while they are alive. \n\n\n\n  Then, when t=\r\nhey pass away, they are given this posting called &quot;Pitru&quot; or ancestors.  Am=\r\navasya is the day when we can worship these ancestors. It is absolutely ess=\r\nential to offer this worship according to each one&#39;s customs. Some people o=\r\nffer `tarpana&#39; on this tithi. Some people offer `Annam Padayal,&#39; offering o=\r\nf food in front of the pictures of the ancestors and then offering it to ot=\r\nhers. One must follow whichever custom one is familiar with but observe the=\r\n Amavasya Vratam in order that our own progeny may lead a prosperous and ha=\r\nppy life.\n\n\n\n  The other significant thing about this day is that it is als=\r\no the day of Sravana Vratam. It falls on the Druva star, and worshipping th=\r\ne Lord Vishnu on this day is sure to grant us every prosperity.\n\n\n\n  08 Feb=\r\n 2008, Friday. Chandra Darshanam\n\n\n\n  This day falls on the 25th day of the=\r\n Tamil month Thai, on a Friday. On this day, one must have a darshan of Cha=\r\nndra, or the Moon.  The Moon, who is Soma Deva, carries several names, such=\r\n as &quot;Pirai,&quot; &quot;Chandran&quot;, &quot;Nishakaran&quot; and so on. His house of Kataka is the=\r\n House of the Mother. He is called Matru karakan and Buddhi karakan. If our=\r\n mind is to work properly, we need the grace of Lord Chandra. Fickle-minded=\r\nness is the main reason why we are sometimes unable to accomplish what we s=\r\net out to do. It is a disease of the mind - a lack of clarity and focus. Fo=\r\nr e.g., one may set out to wear a yellow shirt, then may think that the red=\r\n shirt would look better and pick up the red shirt, change his mind and wea=\r\nr a black shirt and continue to wonder if he should probably have worn a wh=\r\nite shirt. Look at the lack of clarity in his mind. If this is the state of=\r\n the mind, one cannot succeed in any profession. It could be temple worship=\r\n, or computers, or driving - we must first make up our mind - and then set =\r\nout to do that. If your destination is Kumbakonam, you must not keep changi=\r\nng track on the way - else, you&#39;ll reach nowhere. \n\n\n\n  Who grants us this =\r\nclarity of mind? It is the Lord Chandra. We can get his grace by observing =\r\nthe Chandra Vratam. It is one of the easiest of Vratams to observe. Anyone =\r\ncan look up and see the moon. You don&#39;t have to go to a temple and stand in=\r\n a queue for darshan, you don&#39;t have to alter your daily schedule and do an=\r\nything extra, you can even work a night shift - all you have to do is proba=\r\nbly walk upto the terrace, see the moon and chant &quot;Om Chandraya Namah.&quot; It =\r\nis our belief that the Lord Chandra will bless us with sharpness of the min=\r\nd, and clarity. \n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0175_01C880AD.BCDD0CC0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;#ygrp-mkp {\n\tBORDER-RIGHT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; PAD=\r\nDING-RIGHT: 14px; BORDER-TOP: #d8d8d8 1px solid; PADDING-LEFT: 14px; PADDIN=\r\nG-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN: 14px 0px; BORDER-LEFT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; PADDING-TO=\r\nP: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: #d8d8d8 1px solid; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\n}\n#ygrp-mkp HR=\r\n {\n\tBORDER-RIGHT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; BORDER-TOP: #d8d8d8 1px solid; BORDER-=\r\nLEFT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #d8d8d8 1px solid\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #hd {=\r\n\n\tFONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 85%; MARGIN: 10px 0px; COLOR: #628c2a; LINE=\r\n-HEIGHT: 122%\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #ads {\n\tMARGIN-BOTTOM: 10px\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad {\n\tPA=\r\nDDING-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px\n=\r\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad A {\n\tCOLOR: #0000ff; TEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;MET=\r\nA content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3268&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=\r\n=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste learned friends,&lt;/FONT=\r\n&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT fac=\r\ne=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Thank you for sharing this with us.

The \n  Vedas say, &quot;Matru Devo Bhava; Pitru Devo Bh=\r\nava.&quot; It exhorts us to see our \n  mother and our father as the very God in =\r\nflesh and blood.

You don&#39;t have to go to a te=\r\nmple and stand in a \n  queue for darshan, you don&#39;t have to alter your dail=\r\ny schedule and do anything \n  extra, you can even work a night shift =96 al=\r\nl you have to do is probably walk \n  upto the terrace, see the moon and cha=\r\nnt &quot;Om Chandraya Namah.&quot; It is our \n  belief that the Lord Chandra will ble=\r\nss us with sharpness of the mind, and \n  clarity. &lt;O&gt;&lt;/O&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCK=\r\nQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0175_01C880AD.BCDD0CC0--\r\n\n"}}
