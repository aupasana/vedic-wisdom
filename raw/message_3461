In any case, overcoming ego it is a long p=\r\nrocess.\n \nSeeing different deities differently and seeing them as different=\r\n manifestations of the same deity are both fine. If you start disliking peo=\r\nple following one approach or become irritated with their thinking, that sh=\r\nows rajas or tamas. If you understand that all approaches are valid and fol=\r\nlow the approach your mind is inclined in, it is a sattwik approach.\n \n(1) =\r\nWell, you neither promote begging by helping someone, nor do you eradicate =\r\nbegging by ignoring someone. Instead of looking at the system, look at the =\r\nindividuals you encounter. If you can help someone and get an instinct to h=\r\nelp someone, do it.\n \nAt the end of the day, there is no universal right an=\r\nd wrong in any matter. In Mahabharata, Bhishma teaches that dharma comes fr=\r\nom one&#39;s heart. The conscience of a person is pure and shows dharma clearly=\r\n. But, when the instinct coming from conscience passes through the conditio=\r\nned mind, it may become modified by the conditioning of the mind. If one is=\r\n following the conscience, engaging in actions with surrender and giving up=\r\n doership to god at the end, slowly conditioning is removed and conscience =\r\nwill shine brighter through one&#39;s actions.\n \n(2) Yes, such money-minded peo=\r\nple are there in every profession, even in noble professions such as priest=\r\ns, Jyotishis, teachers of scriptures, spiritual leaders etc. But why should=\r\n we judge others? Why not focus the rational mind instead on oneself and ju=\r\ndge one&#39;s own shortcomings?\n \n(3) Mind is highly conditioned by duality and=\r\n responds to symbols. For example, one may say or even think that all mater=\r\nial things are an illusion and temporary. One may say or even think that be=\r\nauty and ugliness are illusive and temporary and death catches up with ever=\r\nything. But, can one control one&#39;s mind when encountering a beautiful perso=\r\nn of opposite sex without clothes? Can one control one&#39;s mind when someone =\r\nabuses one badly or priases one to the skies?\n \nTheory is different and con=\r\ntrol over mind practically is different. To train the mind, we use many sym=\r\nbols. For example, one may see men and women burning on funeral pyres and t=\r\nhe image may stick to one&#39;s mind. When one sees a beautiful person, one may=\r\n recall those images and mind may think about the impermanence of body. Sym=\r\nbols encountered in various religions offer ways for the mind to distract f=\r\nrom negative thoughts and train in thoughts promiting spiritual progress.\n =\r\n\n(4) Some aghoris, some priests, some jyotishis and some spiritual leaders =\r\nmay be running after money or fame without realizing their impermanence. Th=\r\nat is not surprising. But why should we bother about others? Why not focus =\r\non ourselves?\n \nSecondly, someone merely accepting money may or may not be =\r\nattached to money. A realized man does not run after or run away from anyth=\r\ning. One cannot judge a person accurately from one&#39;s actions. One&#39;s intenti=\r\nons and attitude cannot be confidently judged from one&#39;s actions.\n \n(5) NEV=\r\nER be jealous of anybody. Everyone has one&#39;s own samskaras and one&#39;s own ri=\r\nnas and gets results accordingly.\n \n(6) Difficult. If you are a little less=\r\n angry in situations where you normally experience anger, if you are a litt=\r\nle less jealous where you normally feel jealosy, if you are a little less a=\r\nttracted to material things that normally pull you towards them, if you are=\r\n a little less proud in situations where you normally experience pride, if =\r\nyou are a little less depressed in situations where you normally experience=\r\n depression, and if you are able to think of god now and then as the doer o=\r\nf all actions with some sense of surrender, I can say you are making some p=\r\nrogress.\n \nThe prgress is not linear. One may make very slow progress for a=\r\n while and make good progress in short duration, then slowdown again, then =\r\naccelerate again and so on. Keep doing sadhana and it will not go waste.\n \n=\r\n(7) The divine bliss does not come from elsewhere. It is already there. It =\r\nis your own likes, dislikes, anger, jealosy, shame, pride etc that block it=\r\n, like black paint on a lampshade blocking the light of the lamp. To taste =\r\nit, you have to overcome those internal enemies and surrender more complete=\r\nly and unconditionally to god. &quot;I will surrender to you and accept whatever=\r\n you give. But in so and so matter, I want only so and so result&quot; is not co=\r\nmplete and unconditional surrender.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Softw=\r\nare, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manual=\r\ns for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n  =\r\n   Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writi=\r\nngs: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------\n \n&gt; Had rajrishi ji written thi=\r\ns mail on raam naam 2 weeks\n&gt; back, it would have helped me keeping my ego =\r\ndown a lot.\n&gt; Recently i went to ujjain,indore for mahakaal and\n&gt; omkareshw=\r\nar darshan and have come with certain questions.\n&gt; There i kept on thinking=\r\n that there is nothing as shiva,\n&gt; there is one and only god and my god is =\r\nganesh.We see him as\n&gt; different, but he is one.Now what do i consider that=\r\n i\n&gt; should have seen the deities there as omkareshwar and\n&gt; mahakaalshwar =\r\ndiffrently??\n&gt; \n&gt; 1)How do you differentiate the act of giving food by Mani=\r\nsh\n&gt; to that boy from not promoting the begging? B&#39;coz in these\n&gt; places th=\r\nere are many babas who do nothing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2)moreover seeing the priests over =\r\nthere, irritated me coz\n&gt; they were also running after money, making people=\r\n fool in\n&gt; the name of doing rudrabhishek or other things.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3)Though th=\r\ne bhasmarti at mahaakal(ujjain) was marvelous,\n&gt; but it kept reminding me o=\r\nf the fact that why a deity who is\n&gt; TIME ,DEATH personified is being decor=\r\nated in such a\n&gt; manner?\n&gt; \n&gt; 4)When the arti was done there, probably an a=\r\nghori came\n&gt; with &quot;bhasm&quot;.Though he tried avoiding being touched by\n&gt; other=\r\ns, i wished to touch him(after studying AGHORA and\n&gt; being inspired by vima=\r\nlanan) and ask him a few things, but\n&gt; unfortunately couldn&#39;t.\n&gt; But to my =\r\nastonishment, he went and sat outside the temple\n&gt; and kept collecting mone=\r\ny whatever people gave, who came to\n&gt; visit/see him out of curiosty. Now wh=\r\nat shaal i consider,\n&gt; even aghoris are not out of web of maaya?\n&gt; \n&gt; 5) i =\r\ndonot know whether i am jealous or envious of\n&gt; Rajrishi, that he got=A0 a =\r\nchance to spend time with\n&gt; somebody who has reached NVKS.Even when the aar=\r\nti was going\n&gt; on i kept on repeting Ganesh&#39;s name.Did i do something\n&gt; wro=\r\nng?\n&gt; \n&gt; 6)i have been doing ganpati homam for few months.But i do\n&gt; not kn=\r\now whether i done any spiritual progress.How do you\n&gt; figure it out?\n&gt; \n&gt; 7=\r\n)Somewhere you have written in your mails, that once u get\n&gt; a taste of div=\r\nine bliss, you&#39;ll try to immerse in it.How can\n&gt; i tatste it as soon as pos=\r\nsible?\n&gt; \n&gt; Please reply on mail or on forum, as you wish.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n\n\n"}}
