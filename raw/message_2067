I know it&#39;s a highly controversial statement and very d=\r\nifficult to prove or explain.\n\nSomehow i have come to some kind of abstract=\r\n understanding that even the thing which we call &#39;free will&#39; is also pre-or=\r\ndained. the famous example of &#39;Goat tied up with a pole&#39; by thakur, wonderf=\r\nul explanations by Narasimha and many other explanations by earlier philoso=\r\nphical thinkers in relation to free will and destiny are not to be disputed=\r\n here. they all seem true, however, personally I&#39;ve a unexplainable feeling=\r\n that in the ultimate analysis, all the show is *completely* dictated.\n\nI w=\r\nish to write a bit, not for the sake of empty arguments for proving my poin=\r\nt (actually i have no strong point here as my thinking is not baked by soun=\r\nd logic). \n***Nalini bahen said that some souls have free will to take the =\r\nrebirth and so on. i would say that here that their wish on account of *the=\r\nir own free will* is also exactly dictated by Supreme power.\n\n*Rafal questi=\r\noned by stating examples of Prashna chart by Harihara and dharma-sastra by =\r\nBruhaspati. i would say that that also is ordained to happen exactly the wa=\r\ny it happened. Prashna chart of a moment gives the idea of action done till=\r\n that point which will dictate future life. my foolish, childish blabbering=\r\n says that the karma till that moment had been pre-ordained and the future =\r\nis also DONE. Hari hara writing prashna maarga, content of writing, use of =\r\nthe paper and pen, sitting direction, thoughts while writing, my typing on =\r\nmy pc, your reactions and everything else has actually no free will.\n\nFinal=\r\nly what I wish to say is that &quot;Free will is also Fixed Will&quot;\n\nEverything,-e=\r\nvery damn thing, is ordered by &#39;Durgaa Bhagavati Bhadra yayedam dharyate ja=\r\ngat&quot;.\n\nBut all these are written with some intellectual understanding and n=\r\not realization. As narasimha Garu often says, in the realm of Maya, nobody =\r\ncan be sure of anything.\n\nDear members, including my Guru - please ignore m=\r\ne and also forgive me if it was in a bad taste, ridiculous and senseless.\n\n=\r\nYours, \n\nUtpal\n\n \n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, nalini swamy &lt;nali=\r\nni2818@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Utpal Bhai , Rajarshi ji and all,\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaskar=\r\n.\n&gt; I think free will is also a part of Divine Will being orchestrated.=A0T=\r\nhe extent of free will is to realise that Divine Will is all that prevails =\r\nand matters and once you * realise* that is freewill, nothing else but uneq=\r\nuivocal submission to Divine Will=A0 matters. \n&gt; As The Mother said in one =\r\nof her teachings that the human &#39;soul&#39; ( some of them I think) has the free=\r\n will to choose to take birth in particular mother&#39;s =A0womb and have exper=\r\niences in =A0certain realms.

One of=\r\n the oft discussed and eternal questions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If events have al=\r\nready been created like in a movie and later as time unfolds, they happen i=\r\nn our plane of existence, then all talk of freewill must be humbug?

He did not know much =\r\nabout some of the ten incarnations. He described what he saw and I told him=\r\n who was who and a little about them. One of the forms he saw was a radiant=\r\n man with white clothes riding a white horse on a dusty road. I told him he=\r\n was Kalki and he hadn&#39;t come yet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This boy=\r\n is usually playful, easy-going and smiling. But, when I was with him one m=\r\norning, I saw him lost in some serious thought. This was abou a week after =\r\nthe episode mentioned in the above mail.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I asked what he was t=\r\nhinking. He said, &quot;it is not that the future that is to come has not alread=\r\ny happened. It has already happened in reality, but it will happen later wh=\r\nen the time comes. You know what I mean?&quot; I guessed what he was getting at,=\r\n but pretended not to know. I said, &quot;no. What do you mean?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He=\r\n said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say what I am thinking.&quot; This boy is not known =\r\nto be overly intelligent or articulate. His main characteristic is that he =\r\nis usually cheerful, playful, sweet, kind, contented and relaxed. However, =\r\nhe was onto something today. But he could not express himself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n I helped him, &quot;do you mean to say that future has already happened at some=\r\n level, but will reveal itself to people later? Kind of like a movie. A mov=\r\nie may have been shot and become ready in a studio. Some people may have al=\r\nready seen it. But people seeing it on the screen later will think it is ha=\r\nppening in front of them. Are you saying something like that?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n He exclaimed, &quot;exactly. That is what I am saying. If something is going to=\r\n happen in future, it will happen when future comes. But somebody may be ab=\r\nle to see it before future comes, because it has already happened.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though he did not mention it, I knew why he was thinking along these =\r\nlines. When I told him the man riding the horse in his vision over the fire=\r\n was Kalki and he was yet to come, he was probably confused. Given his age =\r\nand ability to think and understand things, this probably seemed like an od=\r\ndity to him that he should see somebody who had not yet come. So he was try=\r\ning to think how it was possible and came to some important conclusions abo=\r\nut &quot;time&quot; in his own way.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Time seems linear at the level of re=\r\ngular consciousness. However, in many planes of conssciousness, the concept=\r\n of time becomes changed. It even loses its meaning when one is established=\r\n in non-dual Aatman or Brahman or Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The=\r\n same boy once performed a very short Kaali homam with a small naama mantra=\r\n of Dakshina Kaali with beejaakshara added before name. When we were medita=\r\nting after poornaahuti, I felt a very intense and powerful energy. It was q=\r\nuite different from the energy I feel normally. This intense energy made my=\r\n mind feel satisfied and blissful and a feeling that can be loosely express=\r\ned in words as &quot;I am done here. I have nothing more left to do. Time to lea=\r\nve&quot; filled my entire consciousnss.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I had experienced the same =\r\nkind of intense energy twice before that. Once I experienced the same energ=\r\ny when I was meditating sitting next to my guru Manish who was doing a Chan=\r\ndi homam in India. Second time was when I had an unexpected opportunity to =\r\nmeditate inside the garbhaalaya of a famous temple, standing within 3 feet =\r\nfrom the main Kaali idol there, which was sanctified and worshipped by a gr=\r\neat saint in the past. The energy I felt was the same on all the three occa=\r\nsions. At no other time did I feel that intense shakti.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Intere=\r\nstingly, after we finished meditation and opened eyes, that boy remarked, &quot;=\r\nout of all the different homas I did so far, this is the bestest homam.&quot; I =\r\nasked him why. He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say it, but it just felt aweso=\r\nme and different.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This boy performed a rea=\r\nlly simple and short procedure, shorter than what I give in manuals. But it=\r\n seemed like he was successful in making a powerful energy manifest there. =\r\nThe bottomline is that internal purity is the most important thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rituals help purify one and purity helps one do a ritual better and g=\r\net more out of it. It is an egg and chicken problem and one has to keep doi=\r\nng it until one breaks through.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Keep performing your chosen sp=\r\niritual practices, but do pay attention to internal purity as you engage in=\r\n external practices. The only worthwhile measure of spiritual progress and =\r\npurity is how smaller your ego becomes. As ego becomes smaller, you can res=\r\nist attraction to external things better and you can resist internal enemie=\r\ns like lust, anger, jealosy etc better. You can do your dharma better. Ego =\r\n- thinking that this is &quot;I&quot; and this is &quot;mine&quot; - is the root cause of all p=\r\nroblems.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Overcoming ego using jnaana yoga i=\r\ns relatively challenging, but bhakti yoga is easier. Think that all that is=\r\n around you - including your house, money, cars, spouse, children and your =\r\nown body - is god&#39;s property and that you are a temporary caretaker of all =\r\nof these properties of god. Do the best job you can, but without entertaini=\r\nng the notion &quot;this is mine&quot;. A faithful servant takes very good care of hi=\r\ns master&#39;s properties, but without thinking of all those things as his or h=\r\ner belongings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Realize that thinking of things as &quot;mine&quot; is no=\r\nt necessary for taking good care of them. A servant who loves one&#39;s master =\r\ntakes the best care of things entrusted to one. When a thing is taken away,=\r\n a servant does not waste time worrying and crying. A servant will accept t=\r\nhat is master&#39;s property and can be taken away anytime. This enables one to=\r\n do the best job with what one possesses and not worry about what one does =\r\nnot possess or what is out of one&#39;s control.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Developing the at=\r\ntitude of a servant who takes care of master&#39;s properties will help one wad=\r\ne the ocean of worldly life without getting caught and overcome ego.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- ---------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.=\r\nVedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/=\r\n group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. h=\r\nome.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst=\r\n rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan =\r\nnath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- - \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ICC World Twenty20 England &#39;09 exclusively on YAHOO!=\r\n CRICKET http://cricket. yahoo.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
