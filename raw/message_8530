Thank you.\n\n\nRe=\r\ngards,\n\n\n \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishn=\r\nan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Prasanth,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; To those who say that they don&#39;t b=\r\nelieve in any religion\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; In general, many of those who don&#39;t believe =\r\nin religion or God are being\n&gt; more honest than those who do. After all, mo=\r\nst people who believe in God\n&gt; look at him as a limited being to barter wit=\r\nh. All of our biases and\n&gt; assumptions are most apparent when dealing with =\r\nour Gods. Often, religion\n&gt; has simply served to formalize these biases.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; While being mired in this word of duality, we think that an ounce of\n&gt; i=\r\nnsincere prayer can undo the whole weight of &quot;paapa&quot; that we engage in\n&gt; th=\r\nroughout the day. And we lay this bias on our God. No wonder that others\n&gt; =\r\nlook at all the suffering in the world and laugh at this concept of God. We=\r\n\n&gt; &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit.\n&gt; \n&gt; We all have plenty of paapa and pu=\r\nnya in our karmic pipeline. Instead of\n&gt; asking for the strength to be stea=\r\ndfast while we reap both kinds of fruits,\n&gt; we ask God to burn &quot;paapa&quot; and =\r\nleave the &quot;punya&quot; intact. It is us &quot;God\n&gt; believers&quot; who look at our lives,=\r\n ignoring all the &quot;paapa phala&quot;. We look\n&gt; at one or two instances of &quot;puny=\r\na phala&quot; and declare our prayers to be\n&gt; successful. However, an impartial =\r\nobserver sees it for what it is, and\n&gt; laughs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are=\r\n the culprit.\n&gt; \n&gt; For the most part, our bhakti is weak. When we are engag=\r\ned in spiritual\n&gt; practices, our bhakti is particularly weak, and we count =\r\nthe seconds and\n&gt; minutes. When engaged in worldly pursuits, our bhakti is =\r\nstrong, and time\n&gt; really flies. And yet, we expect God to reward our weak =\r\nspiritual bhakti\n&gt; and ignore our strong worldly bhakti. An impartial obser=\r\nver sees it for\n&gt; what it is, and laughs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the =\r\nculprit.\n&gt; \n&gt; The best way to bring about new waves of bhakti is not to loo=\r\nk at the\n&gt; &quot;non-believers&quot; and try to convert them. All we have to do is tr=\r\ny to\n&gt; eliminate our lack of belief, and be honest with ourselves. If we ca=\r\nn\n&gt; transform ourselves, the world will be served.\n&gt; \n&gt; If we see God as th=\r\ne limitless power that he is, he is difficult to define.\n&gt; It is difficult =\r\nto capture him within a religion. Religion should see\n&gt; itself as a steppin=\r\ng-stone, and should ask each of us to _eventually_ place\n&gt; our feet on top =\r\nof it to reach the higher goals. Unfortunately, most\n&gt; religions ask us to =\r\naccept them without question. They ask us to place our\n&gt; heads on them with=\r\n reverence, and try to prevent the spiritually advanced\n&gt; from going any fa=\r\nrther.\n&gt; \n&gt; sasneham,\n&gt; \n&gt;    ajit\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
