For\nother planets, mantras recommended by Parasara are still =\r\nthe ones in\ncommon use. In the above case, the commonly used Veda mantras\n(=\r\n&quot;kayaanaschitra&quot; for Rahu and &quot;brihaspate atiyadaryo&quot; for Jupiter)\nare in a=\r\ngreement with Parasara.&quot;\n\n\nA thousand of people have tarted doing homam in =\r\nline with Parashar teaching, it will be very apt if we use those vedic mant=\r\nras to thank the Grahas in daily homam. In my humble opinion It will be gre=\r\nat idea to keep parashar&#39;s tradition alive.\n\n\nAs to the japa/mantra sadhana=\r\n as per your advice time and again, i agree that beej mantras will be more =\r\neffective, as the correct vedic pronunciation is lost.\n\nregards,\nAkshay\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Akshaya&quot; &lt;aks_day@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nDear Narasimha,\n&gt; \n&gt; I was reading a very old post of yours \n&gt; http://group=\r\ns.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/41\n&gt; \n&gt; where you have mentioned tha=\r\nt Parashar gave some different mantras for planets and also their count is =\r\ndifferent than what is generally listed out.\n&gt; \n&gt; I request you to take out=\r\n some time and bring to light the Planet mantras which Parashar gave for be=\r\nnefit of all. Please give english/ devnagri version with meaning. \n&gt; \n&gt; Sin=\r\nce you are sankrit scholar it will be our good fortune if we can hear/learn=\r\n the correct pronunciation via mp3/youtube file.\n&gt; \n&gt; much thanks and regar=\r\nds\n&gt; Akshaya\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
