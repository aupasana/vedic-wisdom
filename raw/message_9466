Jaap with devotion is of utmost importance.\n\n\nYes, bhakti is paramount. Focus / intensity is important. Duration also\nmatters :-)\n\nKeeping count can be counter-productive if it is used as a race to the\nfinish. For example, maybe someone is doing 10 minutes of daily japa, and\ndoes approximately 100 repetitions. They want to make sure that they do 108\nrepetitions, keep count, and end up finishing everything in super speed in\n5 minutes, losing bhakti and focus in the process. Here it is the wrong\ntrade-off.\n\nMaybe the same person who is doing 10 minutes of daily japa decides to do\n1008 repetitions. With the eyes closed, after the normal 10 minutes of\ndaily japa, every extra minute feels like 10 minutes have passed. So, this\nperson decides to keep count, but does not try to speed up or otherwise\n&#39;cheat&#39;. At first, focus is on the count and the 1008 repetitions are\nmechanical. But slowly, the focus moves to the right place. Here, keeping\ncount is a good tool. And this same person may later decide to stop keeping\ncount while during a much longer japa.\n\nThere are no absolutes. Different techniques may be appropriate for\ndifferent people at different times.\n\n&gt; Some mantras are already in debt.\n\n\nAs soon as we start thinking of mantras and devatas in terms of debts and\nbenefits, it is no longer ideal for spiritual progress. What we want is to\nthin the field of vasanas. If a mantra is in debt, and we obtain some\nmantra siddhi, but it doesn&#39;t lessen our vasanas, how useful is that\nmantra, to us, in the final analysis?\n\nsasneham,\n\n    ajit\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Jul 15, 2013 at 9:14 PM, Durgesh Mishra &lt;durgesh.mishra@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Chanting of mantras get accumulated over several births.
