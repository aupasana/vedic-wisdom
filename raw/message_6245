He is known by his unfathomable gravity, by his=\r\n oceanic depth of wisdom derived directly from his intimate knowledge of th=\r\ne Vedic scriptures, and by his unshakable serenity and peace. He is reveale=\r\nd by the steel-like determination he has to save the entire world at any an=\r\nd all cost to himself. \n\nThe true guru is the humblest of sages, yet the st=\r\nrongest of leaders. The true guru will guide you to transcend your illusory=\r\n ego, and to realize your eternal self. The true guru is directly empowered=\r\n by the very shakti of God to deliver liberation unto you, and to swing ope=\r\nn before you the very gates of Vaikuntha, the Realm of God. Narada, Patanja=\r\nli, Vyasa, Jesus, Buddha, Ramanuja, Chaitanya, Prabhupada - these were exam=\r\nples of true gurus.\n\nAllow just such a true guru to enter your life today. =\r\nFall at his feet with humility, serve him sincerely, listen to his instruct=\r\nions with eagerness, and then emulate the actions of such an exalted being =\r\nin your own life, and you will know liberation.\n\nAum Tat Sat\n\n\nHow to Recog=\r\nnize an Authentic Guru:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DyF7poUJDBLs\n\nWatc=\r\nh the video today.\n\n\n\n\nPlease forward.\n\n\n\n"}}
