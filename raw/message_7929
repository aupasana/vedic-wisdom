The very auspicious Vasant/Chaitra Navaratri also starts th=\r\ne same day. I was thinking of starting from either Chaitra Pratipada - Marc=\r\nh 23rd, Shukravara or Chaitra Dvitiya -March 24th, Shanivara. Do you reckon=\r\n this to be a good time to start the homam? and which is a better day - Cha=\r\nitra Pratipada, Shukravara or Chaitra Dvitiya, Shanivara? \n\nI look forward =\r\nto your guidance.\n\nThanks and best regards,\nManish\n\n\n\n\n"}}
