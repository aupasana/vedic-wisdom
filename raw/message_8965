But when I downloaded a few audio f=\r\nor the same - those are longer verses. So my questions are: &lt;br&gt;1. Which on=\r\ne is the correct Pavamana Sukta? &lt;br&gt;2. Where can I find the text of the sa=\r\nme? &lt;br&gt;3. For which deity is it used? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;regards, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jagmohan &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n---1593584224-1233836689-1358628965=:51387--\r\n\n"}}
