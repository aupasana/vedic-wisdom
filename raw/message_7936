I live at Alipore which is quiet close to famou=\r\ns Kali temple. I have a humble plan which I want to share with you. If some=\r\n of you are staying in/ around Calcutta, then we can think of assembling at=\r\n some convenient place and start hawan in group(with separate hawan kund). =\r\nwe can do it periodiacily say on weekends.=A0It is nice that we interact wi=\r\nth each other online and share spritual knowledge and clear our doubts, but=\r\n it would be much better if we can assemble at one place to do a hawan. the=\r\n energy of the collective action should be manyfold and it=A0should benefit=\r\n all.=A0further we can learn from each other. \n&gt; If you notice Muslims and =\r\nGhristians, they pray to God at a common time and place in a group. While, =\r\nwe Hindus seperately visit our temples. May be, thats why their numbers are=\r\n increasing while proportanately ours numbers are decereasing. I just wante=\r\nd to emphasize the importance organising for spritual upliftment. I have no=\r\n ill feelings against anyone. \n&gt; It might have happened in some age that on=\r\ne raam had defeated one ravana. But in this age ravana(kaam, krodh,loabh,..=\r\n) are very powerful and therefore we need to act collectively. \n&gt; I have kn=\r\nown that there=A0some group doing=A0hawan collectively at Bombay.=A0Similar=\r\nly, we can start at calcutta, the place of sri Ramkrishna.=A0=A0\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Fu=\r\nrther, I have a doubt regarding procedure of hawan. I have noticed in the d=\r\nownloaded vedio of Ganapati Hawan that the offering(ghee/coconut peices) ar=\r\ne put in the fire while saying swaha( sometimes it appers in the vedio that=\r\n the offering is put in fire after the mantra is complere and before swaha)=\r\n. I want to know if the offering should go in the fire after the mantra is =\r\ncomplete(before swaha), or while saying swaha, or after the mantra and swah=\r\na is complete.when should it leave our fingers?=A0I had earlier put up this=\r\n question and what I understood from Sri Ananda Kishora&#39;s reply is that the=\r\n offering is=A0to be made to=A0the fire after the mantra chanting with swah=\r\na is complete. But this vedio has created a doubt. Kindly Clarify.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; =\r\nNow a days=A0 few yogacharyas advocate that while doing pranayama the air h=\r\nas to be filled in lungs and not stomach(i.e. the stomach should not bulge)=\r\n. But another group says that air should fill both lungs and stomach(both s=\r\ntomach and lungs should come out). What according to you is the correct pro=\r\ncedure of pranayam?\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Waiting for your reply.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Thanking you \n&gt;=\r\n =A0\n&gt; Nawal=A0\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
