S=\r\nustenance is of sattwa. \nVishnu has always been considered as pure sattwa. =\r\nThe names sattwavaan \nand saattwikaH appear among his 1000 names.\n\nI really=\r\n wonder how some people get highly judgmental and start \npontificating, des=\r\npite really shallow understanding and utter \nconfusions!\n\n&gt;&gt; Nature of wors=\r\nhip is decided based on\n&gt;&gt; the desires, attitude and state of mind. See wha=\r\nt Krishna teaches.\n&gt;\n&gt; Exactly what you want to say? Are you saying that ev=\r\nen if you are\n&gt; praying to evilest arch demon of worst helical reason\n\nRudr=\r\na, Chandi, Shiva etc are NOT &quot;arch demons&quot;!\n\nWe started this conversation b=\r\necause you &quot;condemned&quot; homam to Shiva as \nit is not given in any scripture =\r\naccording to you. When shown ample \nreferences, you bemoaned that taamasik =\r\ndeities should not be worshipped \nwith saattwik methods and said homam to t=\r\naamasik deities should include \n&quot;menstruation blood, meat, fish, alcohol&quot; e=\r\ntc. Now you are making them \nout to be demons. See my note in the other mai=\r\nl on gunas.\n\n&gt; If you really wants to promote homa then do it for sattavik =\r\ndeities \n&gt; only\n\nIf YOU have faith in saattwik deities, you worship saattwi=\r\nk deities. We \nWILL enable people to worship various deities (including Shi=\r\nva!) in \nfire, in a saattwik manner.\n\n&gt; Most straight forward way to worshi=\r\np a tamasik deity is through vaama\n&gt; maarga; this is the hard truth which i=\r\ns very difficult for you to\n&gt; digest. Those who consume alcohol, fish  have=\r\n already been initiated \n&gt; on\n&gt; to vaama marga. They have no other option l=\r\neft with them other then\n&gt; worshiping a tamasik deity.\n\nVaama maarga is not=\r\n just consuming alcohol and fish. Your understanding \nof vaama maarga is pi=\r\ntiable. It is not that you just have fun and a \ndeluded demonic deity who a=\r\nlso likes fun comes along and helps you.\n\nWe say &quot;all is Brahman&quot; and yet w=\r\ne treat some things as pure and some as \nimpure. Vaama maarga is about taki=\r\nng something considered impure and \nbeing able to actually view it as Brahm=\r\nan and not as a limited thing \nthat evokes attraction or aversion in mind. =\r\nIt is about removing \nattraction and aversion for various things from the m=\r\nind completely and \nliberating one. Vaama maarga is not for all and certain=\r\nly not for those \nwho want to enjoy alcohol, fish etc.\n\nBest regards,\nNaras=\r\nimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  =\r\n Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Your=\r\nself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   =\r\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://S=\r\naraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-w=\r\nisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n  =\r\n                    Twitter ID: @homam108\n---------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------\n\n--- In JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com, &quot;A=\r\nrun Yadav&quot; &lt;aruninthecity@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;   Jai Shree Ram,\n&gt;\n&gt; Shree Narasim=\r\nha Ji,\n&gt;\n&gt; Kindly read my response in blue font face.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Narashima is ve=\r\nry quick to give reference of shiva homa in tantrik\n&gt;&gt;&gt; literature\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and =\r\ntamasik purans\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; First of all, I quoted Vishnu Dharmottara Purana and A=\r\ngni Purana! If\n&gt;&gt; Agni (Fire!) Purana is not an acceptable reference for ho=\r\nmam, I \n&gt;&gt; wonder\n&gt;&gt; what is!\n&gt;\n&gt; Is it fault of agni deva that someone wri=\r\nte a tamasik Purana after his\n&gt; name?\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Second of all, the notion that s=\r\nome puranas are saattwik, some are\n&gt;&gt; rajasik and some are tamasik, was con=\r\njured by people who could not\n&gt;&gt; reconcile apparent contradictions within d=\r\nifferent puranas. If one\n&gt;&gt; understands the Upanishadic essence correctly, =\r\nall contradictions \n&gt;&gt; fall\n&gt;&gt; in place and all puranas are meaningful.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Yes, yes keep on mixing what ever come to you. I wonder that if you \n&gt; wer=\r\ne\n&gt; present when devas and demons perform samundra manthan then you would\n&gt;=\r\n have even mixed pots of amrita and visha to from your new recipe of\n&gt; disa=\r\nster.\n&gt; Initially at the time of creation lord divided potency into two ent=\r\nity\n&gt; which are solar and lunar also called Law of Two. Then he further\n&gt; d=\r\nivided it into three entities known as sattva, rajas and tamas also\n&gt; known=\r\n as law of Three. Then he further divided into four entities and \n&gt; so\n&gt; on=\r\n. The fact that everything has emerged from one entity known as \n&gt; Brahma\n&gt;=\r\n is Law of One. Those who are intellectually capable to understand \n&gt; this;=\r\n\n&gt; for them their is no contradiction.\n&gt;\n&gt; Upanishadic essence which you ta=\r\nlked about but have never understand; \n&gt; i\n&gt; have served it in your karma p=\r\nlatter. Now be wise enough to digest it.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; There are primary two way of=\r\n doing any sadhana, one is sattavic and\n&gt;&gt;&gt; other is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tamasik also known=\r\n as right handed and left handed paths. Vedic\n&gt;&gt;&gt; philosophy is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; right h=\r\nanded and tantaric philosophy is left handed.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; All tantrik philosophy =\r\nis NOT left handed. There are right handed\n&gt;&gt; tantras as well as left hande=\r\nd tantras. You are totally off the mark.\n&gt;\n&gt; In your figment of imagination=\r\n you have created your own world which \n&gt; is\n&gt; based on your faulty knowled=\r\nge which you have gained from goggling. \n&gt; Come\n&gt; out of it and face the ha=\r\nrd truths. Extraordinary people who achieve\n&gt; extraordinary spiritual, inte=\r\nllectual and material heights either have\n&gt; followed complete right handed =\r\nor complete left handed path. Nothing\n&gt; great can be achieved but mixing bo=\r\nth of them. Mixture is for general\n&gt; populace who will remain general, ordi=\r\nnary, insignificant and \n&gt; worthless\n&gt; for reaming part of their lives.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; Do you consider Rudra, Durga and Chandi as &quot;taamasik deities&quot;? If I\n&gt; wan=\r\nt\n&gt;&gt; to worship Rudra with Rudra Namaka Prasna (from YajurVeda) or Durga\n&gt; =\r\nwith\n&gt;&gt; Durga Sooktam (from RigVeda) or Chandi with Devi Sooktam (from\n&gt; Ri=\r\ngVeda),\n&gt;&gt; are you suggesting that I should do all of the above???!\n&gt;\n&gt; Why=\r\n should i suggest you anything? You should read scriptures of your\n&gt; faith =\r\nand try to understand it yourself and kindly spare me with the\n&gt; horror of =\r\nsuggesting anything to you.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The above is utter nonsense.\n&gt;&gt; It is sayi=\r\nng that the only way to worship some fierce deities (let me\n&gt;&gt; use this ter=\r\nm instead of tamasik deities) is through vaama maarga\n&gt;&gt; (left-handed path)=\r\n. That is nonsense. Left-handed path is for those\n&gt; who\n&gt;&gt; are already so p=\r\nure that even meat, fish, alcohol and sex do not\n&gt;&gt; distract one&#39;s focus fr=\r\nom god and from the deep realization that\n&gt; &quot;sarvam\n&gt;&gt; khalvidam brahma&quot;. I=\r\nt is not for all. As Robert Svoboda correctly \n&gt;&gt; says\n&gt;&gt; at the beginning =\r\nof &quot;Aghora: At the left hand of god&quot;, most people \n&gt;&gt; who\n&gt;&gt; are attracted =\r\nto this path for the kick are doomed to fail and those\n&gt; who\n&gt;&gt; are pure en=\r\nough for it are not attracted to it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Fierce deities such as Rudra, Du=\r\nrga, Chandi etc can be worshipped in \n&gt;&gt; a\n&gt;&gt; saattwik manner also and THAT=\r\n is better for MOST people.\n&gt;\n&gt; Most straight forward way to worship a tama=\r\nsik deity is through vaama\n&gt; maarga; this is the hard truth which is very d=\r\nifficult for you to\n&gt; digest. Those who consume alcohol, fish  have already=\r\n been initiated \n&gt; on\n&gt; to vaama marga. They have no other option left with=\r\n them other then\n&gt; worshiping a tamasik deity. Those people who consume alc=\r\nohol and \n&gt; recite\n&gt; mantras of sattavik deities; disaster will fall upon t=\r\nhen and they \n&gt; will\n&gt; soon loose all of their land, wealth and prestige. T=\r\nhis is called\n&gt; spiritual and moral decay of the society. Same is the cause=\r\n of the \n&gt; decay\n&gt; of India and firstly mugals and then Britishers rules ov=\r\ner us. Same \n&gt; kind\n&gt; of spiritual decay can be seen with Kashmire pundits =\r\nand they also \n&gt; loose\n&gt; all of their lands and homes and become refugees.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Spiritual and moral decay of any society is the reason of its fall.\n&gt; T=\r\nhose who can&#39;t stand firm on their dharma will fall. These are not my\n&gt; own=\r\n views, read literature related to Aachyara Chanakya.\n&gt;\n&gt; Those who are fol=\r\nlower of sattavik order will most definitely face\n&gt; disaster if they try to=\r\n adopt tamasik ways. Sadhana means aiming \n&gt; either\n&gt; positive energies or =\r\nnegative energies. Such an endeavor will cause\n&gt; movement in the energies g=\r\noverning the native. However when someone\n&gt; foolishly mixes both positive a=\r\nnd negative energies disaster will be\n&gt; resulted because of that one may su=\r\nddenly loose their father, mother,\n&gt; children, face accidents, face state p=\r\nunishment etc. Things will \n&gt; happen\n&gt; so suddenly, like a spark or a blast=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; BTW, those who want to understand the gunas composing deities, human=\r\ns\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; and demons should read Yoga Vaasishtham. Vasishtha defines a 3x3\n&gt; m=\r\natrix\n&gt;&gt; of gunas and places various kinds of deities, humans and demons in=\r\n\n&gt; that.\n&gt;&gt; His description removes a lot of misconceptions on &quot;tamasik dei=\r\nties&quot;\n&gt;&gt; etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; So you did read yoga Vassishtham; still you can&#39;t underst=\r\nand anything\n&gt; about the divinity. With you hairy knowledge your downfall i=\r\ns evident.\n&gt; That is all I can say.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Sattvik way of pleasing lord shiv=\r\na is offering sattvik things to\n&gt; shiva\n&gt;&gt;&gt; lingam.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Is Shiva a sattwi=\r\nk deity or a taamasik deity according to you? If he\n&gt; is\n&gt;&gt; a taamasik deit=\r\ny, I thought your theory was that he should not be\n&gt;&gt; worshipped in a saatt=\r\nwik manner! If he is a saattwik deity, what was\n&gt;&gt; your problem with a saat=\r\ntwik homam to him? You lectured on the\n&gt; taamasik\n&gt;&gt; methods above!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I=\r\n see no consistency in your views and all I can see is stubbornness\n&gt; and\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; terrible misconceptions.\n&gt;\n&gt; That is why I said that you have no right to=\r\n compose a solka in honor \n&gt; of\n&gt; lord Shiva because you don&#39;t know anythin=\r\ng about the esoteric plays of\n&gt; divinity. I will not explain to you on this=\r\n open forum that why it is\n&gt; very very auspicious to please as tamasik male=\r\n deity such as lord \n&gt; shiva\n&gt; in form of lingam. You will again say that I=\r\n should keep my views to\n&gt; myself. These things requires little amount of f=\r\naith.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; He is foolishly creating a new bread of homa where sattavic w=\r\nay are\n&gt;&gt;&gt; employed\n&gt;&gt;&gt; to perform homa of a tamasik deity. What he is teac=\r\nhing is not homa\n&gt;&gt;&gt; but a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; complete disaster.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On saattwik, raajas=\r\nik and taamasik worships, see what Krishna says in\n&gt;&gt; Bhagavad Gita. Just b=\r\necause you consider Rudra to be tamasik, worship\n&gt; of\n&gt;&gt; Rudra for spiritua=\r\nl progress does not become taamasik. Just because \n&gt;&gt; we\n&gt;&gt; consider Vishnu=\r\n to be saattwik, worship of Vishnu for the death of an\n&gt;&gt; enemy does not be=\r\ncome saattwik.\n&gt; Worship of Rudra or shiva in form of Shiva Lingam is not t=\r\namasik way \n&gt; of\n&gt; worship.\n&gt;\n&gt; Lord Vishnu is rajasik deity, he always sus=\r\ntains. Worship of Vishnu \n&gt; for\n&gt; death of an enemy is absolute nonsense.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Sattavik ways of worship result in strengthening the native it can \n&gt; ne=\r\nver\n&gt; be used to harm anybody.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tamasik ways of worship will results in =\r\nweakening once enemies, so if\n&gt; one wants to harm once enemies he has to pl=\r\nease a tamasik deity.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nature of worship is decided based on\n&gt;&gt; the =\r\ndesires, attitude and state of mind. See what Krishna teaches.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Exactl=\r\ny what you want to say? Are you saying that even if you are\n&gt; praying to ev=\r\nilest arch demon of worst helical reason even then you \n&gt; are\n&gt; pure if you=\r\nr attitude and state of mind is correct? What could be that\n&gt; state of mind=\r\n? What could be that attitude? I wonder=E2=80=A6\n&gt;\n&gt;   As well said by Mr.K=\r\naul; aim of any sadhana is to become one with \n&gt; the\n&gt; deity. So, what stat=\r\ne of mind and with which attitude one should pray \n&gt; to\n&gt; an arch demon so =\r\nthat he didn&#39;t become equal to him?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; We do not cater to those who wan=\r\nt to do homam for taamasik purposes,\n&gt; no\n&gt;&gt; matter which deity. We cater t=\r\no people worshipping various deities \n&gt;&gt; for\n&gt;&gt; mostly saattwik purposes, v=\r\niz fulfilling dharmik desires at the\n&gt; material\n&gt;&gt; level and progressing sp=\r\niritually. So the procedure we teach IS\n&gt;&gt; invariable saattwik.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; If =\r\nyou really wants to promote homa then do it for sattavik deities \n&gt; only\n&gt; =\r\nand must emphasis that native of sattavik temperament are only advised\n&gt; to=\r\n do it and only if pure cow ghee is available. If homa is done \n&gt; without\n&gt;=\r\n considering these things then it will harm gods. Aim of a sattvik homa\n&gt; i=\r\ns to increase sattva guna in the environment. A tamo guni native will\n&gt; cau=\r\nse more harm then doing any good.\n&gt;\n&gt; Consider it as a request.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; It is=\r\n said in all scriptures that all spiritual practices should be\n&gt;&gt;&gt; followed=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; under the guidance of a bonafide guru. A native without a capable\n&gt; gu=\r\nru\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; like god without power.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Those who want a physical guru =\r\ncan think of me or my guru Dr Manish\n&gt;&gt; Pandit as gurus for the homam proce=\r\ndures taught by us in free \n&gt;&gt; manuals.\n&gt;&gt; If you are doing something wrong=\r\n because of my instruction, I am\n&gt; willing\n&gt;&gt; to take on the karma and suff=\r\ner the consequences.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; You are doing a big mistake here. Be ready to =\r\nface the consequences.\n&gt; It&#39;s your life, what can I say? Best of luck.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; The original purohit and the original guru of Veda is Agni, the Fire.\n&gt; =\r\nIf\n&gt;&gt; you do not have a capable guru, take Agni as the guru, worship him\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n everyday or every weekend and surrender to him. He will do the job of\n&gt; a\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; guru and transform you. Anybody who says that is not possible does \n&gt;&gt; n=\r\not\n&gt;&gt; know the power of Agni! Fire ritual is not my creation. It was the\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n favorite sadhana of rishis and many cultures benefited from it.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; At t=\r\nhe time of rashis, most people are of sattavik nature and pure cow\n&gt; ghee, =\r\npure grains and pure wood are readily available.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Those who do not li=\r\nke homam, please do not do it. But please do not\n&gt;&gt; discourage others who m=\r\nay be interested. That is a bad karma.\n&gt; Especially\n&gt;&gt; in today&#39;s times.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Asking you to do homa of sattavik deity with pure cow ghee and pure\n&gt;=\r\n other offerings is not a bad karma. This karma will definitely bring\n&gt; goo=\r\nd fortunes to me. Definitely.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Arun.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --=\r\n- In JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Arun Yadav&quot; aruninthecity@\n&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Jai Shree Ram,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Shree A K Kaul Ji,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#39;s nice that you =\r\nparticipate but try to understand the context\n&gt; only\n&gt;&gt;&gt; then you can bring=\r\n something productive to the discussion.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; There is a way to perform =\r\nspiritual sadhana which bring prosperity\n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt;&gt; happiness to the individ=\r\nual and to the people concerned. As a matter\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of fact all sadhanas are a=\r\nimed towards strengthening the basic laws\n&gt; of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nature. If a native with=\r\n his deeds be able to strengthen these law\n&gt; he\n&gt;&gt;&gt; will be benefited and w=\r\nill rise in life.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; There are primary two way of doing any sadhana, o=\r\nne is sattavic and\n&gt;&gt;&gt; other is tamasik also known as right handed and left=\r\n handed paths.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Vedic philosophy is right handed and tantaric philosophy=\r\n is left\n&gt;&gt;&gt; handed.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Correct procedure of performing a sattavic hom=\r\na is that native\n&gt;&gt;&gt; collects dry mango tree wood since mango karaka is sur=\r\nya and thus is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; considered as most sattvic tree. Then native must arrang=\r\ne absolutely\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pure cow ghee. It is well known who sattavic cow ghee is; =\r\nits many\n&gt;&gt;&gt; times pure then normal buffalo ghee. Then one collects other\n&gt;=\r\n offering\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of absolutely sattavic in nature. It is also essential that s=\r\nadhak\n&gt;&gt;&gt; must be of sattavic temperament and not accustomed to vices such =\r\nas\n&gt;&gt;&gt; lying, cheating, consuming alcohol etc. If native is a brahmachari\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; then it is very favorable. Now native must choose mantras of\n&gt; sattavic\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; gods such as soma, agni, prajapati, indra, savitura etc. This homa\n&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nmust be is performed early in the morning since during this time\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sattva=\r\n guna is maximum. Native should face east direction from where\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sun rise=\r\ns as sun is the harbinger of sattva guna. In the similar\n&gt;&gt;&gt; fashion many m=\r\nore rule exists which when followed correctly will\n&gt;&gt;&gt; result in a homa whi=\r\nch will leave its everlasting impression on the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; native and will bring t=\r\nremendous auspicious results.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Correct procedure of performing a tam=\r\nasik homa is that native\n&gt; collect\n&gt;&gt;&gt; wood of some tamasik tree such as ba=\r\nbool, kikar then tantarick must\n&gt;&gt;&gt; arrange all tamasik offering such a men=\r\nsulation blood, flesh, fish,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; alchoal, some kind of tamasik oil etc. It =\r\nis also essential that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sadhak must be of tamasik temperament must consu=\r\nme alcohol, meat\n&gt;&gt;&gt; himself. He must have very active sex life. Now such a=\r\n native must\n&gt;&gt;&gt; choose mantras of tamasik deity and perform this homa in t=\r\nhe middle\n&gt; of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; night when tamo guna is maximum and he must face south d=\r\nirection.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; These are some of very general rules of correctly perform=\r\ning both\n&gt; left\n&gt;&gt;&gt; handed and right handed homas. As a matter of fact, som=\r\ne rules are\n&gt; so\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cryptic and esoteric that native will only understand =\r\nthese as the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; merit of many lifetimes. These rules are kept as secret of=\r\n utmost\n&gt;&gt;&gt; importance and only disciples of those traditions can come any\n=\r\n&gt; closer\n&gt;&gt;&gt; to these rules. Kashmari tantrism is highly developed traditio=\r\nn and\n&gt; as\n&gt;&gt;&gt; you belong to this cult, you must be well aware about these\n=\r\n&gt; delicacies\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of your tradition.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Narashima is very quick to give=\r\n reference of shiva homa in tantrik\n&gt;&gt;&gt; literature and tamasik purans; bett=\r\ner if he can read these\n&gt; literatures\n&gt;&gt;&gt; more deeply and try to understand=\r\n correct procedure to performing\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tamasik homa.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; He is foolishly =\r\ncreating a new bread of homa where sattavic way are\n&gt;&gt;&gt; employed to perform=\r\n homa of a tamasik deity. What he is teaching is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; not homa but a complet=\r\ne disaster. Either he is deliberately mixing\n&gt;&gt;&gt; both left and right handed=\r\n paths or he is intellectually week to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; differentiate between the two. W=\r\nhatever is the reason, but he must\n&gt;&gt;&gt; stop doing this catastrophe. Based o=\r\nn his faith and believes he\n&gt; should\n&gt;&gt;&gt; either choose left or right handed=\r\n path. He has no right to mix both\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of them and thus creating a recipe o=\r\nf disaster. Think about those\n&gt; poor\n&gt;&gt;&gt; soles that have been mentally, emo=\r\ntionally and spiritually harmed by\n&gt;&gt;&gt; performing this stupidity.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; S=\r\nattvik way of pleasing lord shiva is offering sattvik things to\n&gt; shiva\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n lingam. This is most appropriate and beneficial way to receive\n&gt;&gt;&gt; blessin=\r\ngs of lord shiva. For the same purpose millions of temples\n&gt; have\n&gt;&gt;&gt; been =\r\nerected all over India.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Arun\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In J=\r\nyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com, AK Kaul &lt;jyotirved@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shri Aru=\r\nn Yadav ji,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jai Shri Ram!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You appear to be eating a long yarn abo=\r\nut a simple point that &quot;Lord\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shiva is\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; never ever pleased with hom=\r\na of any kind or any type.

One should also understand that since\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; pure cow\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ghee\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is not easily available and it&#39;s rare to find any=\r\n people with fully\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; activated\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Pingala nadi; any homam will not yie=\r\nld satisfactory results. Purity\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; material\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; offered into hom=\r\na and purity of the person performing the homa is\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; essential.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n If a person accustomed to alcohol, lying, cheating if perform homa\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wi=\r\nll only\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; experience malefic results same is true if homam is performed =\r\nwith\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; adulterated\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; butter.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If a person not corrupted by v=\r\nice perform homam with pure cow ghee\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and tries\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; please dei=\r\nties living in heaven such as indra, varuna, soma, agni,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; prajapati\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; etc\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then such a native is equivalent(or will soon become) to demigod=\r\ns.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Same is true for a brahmachari or a yogi who perform internal\n=\r\n&gt; homam.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is said in all scriptures that all spiritual practice=\r\ns should be\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; followed\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; under the guidance of a bonafide guru. A nat=\r\nive without a capable\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; guru is\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; god without power.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; One should consider himself as luck if he is able to save himself\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nfrom self\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; titled kalyugi gurus.
