I was writing in a flo=\r\nw and never checked what I wrote. Kindly pardon such errors and read throug=\r\nh them. As they say, &quot;Bhavnayoko samjho!&quot;.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nDuring the =\r\nday time, we roamed around shooting at different places. In this 3 days we =\r\nnever visited any of the temples in Kasi. I asked him, &quot;What about the temp=\r\nles? Won&#39;t we visit them?&quot;. Manish retorted immediately, &quot;=C2=A0Aren&#39;t we=\r\n=C2=A0going to the most powerful temple in Kasi every night?&quot;! I silently a=\r\ngreed. This is something about Manish I have observed. He rarely enters tem=\r\nples or standard places of worship, but suddenly he might see a small roads=\r\nide temple and stand and stare for sometimes, even do a pranam and then rem=\r\nark, &quot;There is something here.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nDuring evening we went to visit the =\r\nKinnaram Ashram. Kinnaram Baba was a Aghori who lived in Kasi=C2=A0during t=\r\nhe 16th century. The place is called Aghor-sthal. Before entering Manish bo=\r\nught some bel leaves. As we walked inside the Ashram, Manish became silent,=\r\n then said there are strong energies in here. Inside we meditated for somet=\r\nime, Manish did=C2=A0 pranam=C2=A0at the samadhi of Baba Bhagwan Ram who wa=\r\ns the 11th head of the Ashram. Baba Bhagwan Ram had entered Nirvikalpa Sama=\r\ndhi while meditating for 3 continuous days at the Manikarnika Samshan.=C2=\r\n=A0 Manish, on being=C2=A0questioned, said that many sadhanas have been don=\r\ne here in this place for long by people with no mundane desires. Therefore,=\r\n the energies are strong here. While looking around the Ashram we found som=\r\ne quotations which were written in small wooden boards. Manish called Aruni=\r\nsha and me and pointed to one quotation. Translated to English, it read, &quot;I=\r\nf you have to give your head off to get a sadguru, you\n have=C2=A0got it ch=\r\neap&quot;.\n=C2=A0\nBy 8 PM we sat for dinner. We used to have early dinners, so t=\r\nhat we had sufficient time before going to the samshan. Ideally you should =\r\nhave an empty stomach while performing any sadhana to get the best effects.=\r\n The amount of fire in the body is fixed. There is one that digests food - =\r\nJathara Agni. One that digests ideas/concepts/experiences - Bhuta Agni (exi=\r\nstential fire) which exists in the subtle body. It is the second which must=\r\n increase in order for one to &quot;digest&quot; various experiences/ideas/etc. It ca=\r\nn only increase when the Jathara Agni is less, i.e. you do not have a full =\r\nstomach. When we are extremely focused on something and working intently on=\r\n the same, we forget food, we do not feel hungry. This is due to the increa=\r\nse in Bhuta Agni and decrease in Jathara Agni.\n=C2=A0\nAs we sat eating our =\r\nfood and talking on different topics, we discussed history.The conversation=\r\n mentioned here is a thread picked up from an earlier conversation that we =\r\n(Manish, Arunisha and=C2=A0me) had before coming to Kasi. \n=C2=A0\nManish sa=\r\nid, &quot;It is the same set of=C2=A0souls who come back=C2=A0again and again in=\r\n different bodies and personalities at different times, who=C2=A0are respon=\r\nsible for this land. There was Chadragupta and Chanakya, there was Prithvir=\r\naj, there was Akbar, Shankaracharya, Ramakrishna etc.&quot; He continued, &quot;They =\r\ncan come as kings, yogis, or any other form which is necessary for them to =\r\naccomplish their dharma. And their dharma is connected to this land=C2=A0wh=\r\nich we call India=C2=A0today.This land is connected to the Rishis. This is =\r\nRishi bhoomi. And Rishis sent people when needed.=C2=A0Prithviraj made one =\r\nmistake, of pardoning Ghori. Imagine what happened to that woman who made P=\r\nrithiviraj disobey his Guru?&quot;.I silently contemplated her fate.=C2=A0\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n&quot;One very senior Rishi has decided to=C2=A0change this land back to a R=\r\nishi bhoomi. And so shall it happen.=C2=A0Ved=C2=A0Dharma will be re establ=\r\nished here along the length and breadth. Nothing, however powerful or might=\r\nly, be it an individual or=C2=A0group,=C2=A0can stand against the will of a=\r\n Rishi.&quot;=C2=A0 Arunisha asked a pertinent question here. &quot;What were the Ris=\r\nhis doing for=C2=A0one thousand years?&quot;. Manish laughed and said, &quot; A Rishi=\r\n can very well spend a thousand years simply in samadhi, meditating. Then s=\r\nuddenly=C2=A0one day=C2=A0wake up from meditation=C2=A0and see that Rishi b=\r\nhoomi is gone=C2=A0and all sorts of non-spiritual things going on here. So =\r\nHe decides, it is time to get back and re create the Rishi bhoomi. You guys=\r\n have no clue about=C2=A0what a Rishi can do. One Rishi is enough to change=\r\n a universe, changing a country is child&#39;s play for Him.&quot; Wow. I let all th=\r\nese sink inside me slowly. Therefore it is so important to keep doing sadha=\r\nna, in some manner or the other.\n=C2=A0\nAs night approached midnight, Manis=\r\nh and I left for the Manikarnika again. This was going be our last night of=\r\n Chandi homa at Manikarnika, for now. We walked long the=C2=A0deserted ghat=\r\ns, sliently. I asked him if it is ok doing a=C2=A0homa of Shiva/Bhairava on=\r\n a pyre. He said=C2=A0yes why not, but without Shakti, there will be no Shi=\r\nva. Worshipping the divine feminie is the most practical strategy of sadhan=\r\na. Shiva is the state of highest consciousness, and to reach that stage one=\r\n must develop his body and mind such that it can hold shakti=C2=A0for which=\r\n=C2=A0worshipping the divine Mother is the best way.=C2=A0That is why Vimal=\r\nananda says, &quot;Let the Mother show you the face of the Father&quot;. The topic dr=\r\nifted to Vimalananda. Manish said, &quot;Kala Bhairava is very strong in Manikar=\r\nnika, where as Mahakala exists powerfully in the cremation grouds at Ujjain=\r\n. But Vimalananda did Mahakala sadhana here in Manikarnika.&quot; Then staring a=\r\nt the pitch black ganges, Manish chuckled lightly and\n added, &quot;That man was=\r\n something.&quot; This was again an old conversation we had started=C2=A0before =\r\nwhich Mainsh continued, &quot;All these babas of today would wet their pants if =\r\nVimalananda were to stand infornt of them. Those three books have the power=\r\n of a deity flowing through them. Without being physically present, Vimalan=\r\nanda has created a army of sadhakas!&quot;. I interjected, &quot;The books=C2=A0are l=\r\nike a Bible=C2=A0for sadhakas,=C2=A0arn&#39;t they?&quot;. &quot;Yes&quot; said Manish. Later =\r\non I asked him if it was possible for someone to meet Vimalanada, to which =\r\nManish replied that yes it was, if one does serious sadhana. However, the i=\r\nmportant question is whether one will be able to recognize him. I fell sile=\r\nnt hearing this. Interestingly, in the 2nd book of the Aghora series, Vimal=\r\nanda does mention that a time will come when his &quot;children&quot; would spread ho=\r\nmas. Strange, or maybe not so. Who knows how deep things run. \n=C2=A0\nWe re=\r\nached the samshan by half past twelve. This time we sat at the same place w=\r\nhere we had sat on the first day of homa. The fire was low. Most of the bod=\r\ny had been burnt already. Manish started the homa. As usual, all the dogs c=\r\name and sat peacefully around the fire. Now this did not surprise me any mo=\r\nre. In the middle of the homa Manish would slowly lift his=C2=A0palm upward=\r\ns=C2=A0and with the next ahuti=C2=A0immediately the fire would leap higher.=\r\n He did this quite a few times, when=C2=A0the flames were getting weaker. I=\r\n countinued with the Chandi path and passing on the samagri to him as and w=\r\nhen he required anything. One dom who was working on a pyre nearby, came to=\r\nwards us and exclaimed,&quot;Jai Mahadev&quot;. Manish too responded back, &quot;Jai Mahad=\r\nev&quot;. This homa was faster. He did not use any &quot;samputs&quot;, but a direct, stra=\r\night Chandi homa. Again in the middle I got up and stroked the pyre a bit, =\r\npushing around some of the coconut pieces to make them burn properly. I was=\r\n\n enjoying it. A few people came and sat near us, listening to the path. In=\r\n Kasi there is a rule that whatever comes in the Samshan is the property of=\r\n the Dom Raja (the head of doms). No one has any further claim on it. In ol=\r\nd times, one Dom Raja was called Kallu Dom. He was an Aghori and a contempo=\r\nrary of Kinnaram Baba. It is said he could raise the dead back to life. May=\r\nbe it is because of this tradition that Manikarnika is such an apt place fo=\r\nr these sadhanas. I was at one point mentally wondering why are there so ma=\r\nny people in the samshan. The Manish said, if a Nath came here in his garb,=\r\n everyone will run away from the samshan scared. But there is a reason why =\r\nthere are people here even so late in the night.\n=C2=A0\nOnce the final purn=\r\nahuti was given, we sat for meditation. Though this homa got over faster th=\r\nan previous days, the meditation that happened, for me, was superb. At one =\r\npoint I felt as if my mind would just burst forth and expand across the len=\r\ngth and breadth of the Ganges. My focus was good, but I had to open my eyes=\r\n after every 20 minutes or so. Manish continued meditating for nearly an ho=\r\nur. Not the slightest movement from him. Nothing. Still like a stone. Then =\r\na cow came and slightly nudged Manish on his feet. That made him open his e=\r\nyes. Manish remarked, &quot; I could have just left my body and gone off. It did=\r\n not matter that I had a flight to catch the next day, or anything else. I =\r\nwas on the verge of death. Just at that moment the cow and brought me back.=\r\n&quot; Smiling he added, &quot;What a sight it would have been for the people to see,=\r\n how the body can be left at will&quot;.=C2=A0 I did not know what to say. \n=C2=\r\n=A0\nWe stood there watching another pyre in front. The body was half burnt.=\r\n The torso had become black with deep=C2=A0red patches all over. The dom ca=\r\nme forward, and with the bamboo stick inserted it (the bamboo stick)=C2=A0f=\r\nrom the side of the corpse, lifting up the burning torso into the air and p=\r\nlacing it again, strategically, in the middle of the pyre. The smooth=C2=A0=\r\nmotion of lifting up the half burnt torso, sticking out from one end of the=\r\n bamboo stick,=C2=A0into the thin, dark, night-air reminded me of how we us=\r\ne a fork to lift pieces of food - meat=C2=A0or vegetables, both dead -=C2=\r\n=A0from our plates to our mouths. Manish asked me smiling, &quot;Maza aya?&quot;. I s=\r\nmiled back in acknowledgement. Then he commented=C2=A0that I should write a=\r\nbout this experience in the coming days. Let people know.\n=C2=A0\nBy this ti=\r\nme I remembered that when I was sitting and doing the Chandi path, one dog=\r\n=C2=A0had run off with one of my chappals. I informed Manish. He exclaimed,=\r\n &quot; Kya baat hai! Leave the other chappal here as well.&quot; Manish said we had =\r\na rna with this samshan. We had been here before, in some life.\n=C2=A0\nAs w=\r\ne were returning, Manish said one of the point (the three peaks)=C2=A0of Sh=\r\niva&#39;s trishul passes through the Manikarkina. Therefore, it is a &quot;safe&quot; sam=\r\nshan. Anyone who tries anything negative here will face troubles. The trish=\r\nul of Shiva guards this place. No spirit will cause any unnecessary disturb=\r\nance inside the samshan. That is also why there are people here even at 2 a=\r\nm in the morning. There is safety in numbers. As long as ones intentions ar=\r\ne genuine and good, Manikarnika is a wonderful place to do sadhana.\n=C2=A0\n=\r\nWhile walking along the ghats=C2=A0which were=C2=A0totally deserted, Manish=\r\n instructed me not to stop. The knot in my red lungi was becoming loose, I =\r\ncaught hold of it=C2=A0with one=C2=A0hand and kept moving fast, trying to k=\r\neep pace with Manish. Later Manish asked me if I had got some smell. I thou=\r\nght and recollected that yes, I did get a faint smell of heena. Twice. Mani=\r\nsh told me it was a &quot;Mokul&quot;. A muslim spirit of similar level as a Yaksha o=\r\nr a Yakshini. Once the ritual is over, and you are out of the samshan, do n=\r\not wait along the banks, he instructed. Do not move too close to the water=\r\n=C2=A0late in the nightt. There are things in the water. Generally they may=\r\n not do anything, but why take a chance. The protection of Shiva is only in=\r\nside the Manikarnika Ghat. Then he added, Deoriya Baba (I may have mis-spel=\r\nt the name) used to live in the middle of this Ganges 24/7. This is a city =\r\nof saints. Here God-intoxicated Paramhamsas would roam around naked. It is =\r\ntheir city.\n=C2=A0\nNext morning, as we sat recollecting the previous night&#39;=\r\ns homa, Manish talked about Vedas.=C2=A0Few sadhaks, if ever, are equally c=\r\nomfortable with both paths of=C2=A0Aghora and Vedas. For a Veda mantra to s=\r\nhow its effects, one must get the intonation perfect. This age most people =\r\ncannot do that. I=C2=A0enquired that I had heard from someone that a certai=\r\nn procedure needs to be done before one starts any sadhana in the samshan. =\r\nManish=C2=A0laughed and replied,=C2=A0&quot;Karna to sab kuch chahiye, par mujhe=\r\n to kuch nehi aata!&quot;.=C2=A0I was dumbstruck.=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nWhile talking abo=\r\nut Ramayana with Arunisha, his eyes suddenly become half closed. He voice b=\r\necame slow and heavy,=C2=A0&quot;The color of Rama&#39;s body is deep blue with a go=\r\nlden tinge all=C2=A0around him. Like a sun blazing. That=C2=A0was the kavac=\r\nha given to Rama by Vishwamitra, the real Gayatri with two special samputs.=\r\n It was impenetrable. And when he shot his arrows, the motion of his hands=\r\n=C2=A0is so fast that a normal human eye will not able to observe. In 12 ho=\r\nurs he had destroyed a forest of Ashuras.=C2=A0Ravana had a Chandrahaas kha=\r\ndga. It was a=C2=A0mantra shakti he had acquired through sadhana. The Khadg=\r\na had become part of his right hand, which would fly off to kill mercilessl=\r\ny at the slightest=C2=A0command from his mind. Such was the calibre of the =\r\nenemy. \n=C2=A0\nAnd Rama removed even=C2=A0his Gayatri Kavacha, and fought l=\r\nike a normal human being when he defeated Ravana which=C2=A0means; he even =\r\nremoved the last vestige of his ego of being a God, and fought like a human=\r\n. Is it any wonder then, that the whole of north India goes crazy at the me=\r\nre mention of the name of Sri Rama?&quot;. \n=C2=A0\nHe spoke with such an energy =\r\nwhich cannot be defined, as if he was there and seen it all. Rama Naam Saty=\r\na Hai.\n=C2=A0\nThus ends my recounting of our fascinating trip to Kasi.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n\n\nRama Naama Satya Hai..\n\n--- On Sat, 16/1/10,=\r\n rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: rajarshi nandy &lt;raj=\r\narshi14@...&gt;\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Rama Naam Satya Hai - 2\nTo: ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Saturday, 16 January, 2010, 11:25 PM\n\n\n=C2=\r\n=A0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Narasimha\n=C2=A0\nIt may sound weird, but this is what hap=\r\npens in real life all the time. You, I, all these people are pieces in anot=\r\nher kind of chess game. \n=C2=A0\nGreat analogy. Manish had given this analog=\r\ny to us after he=C2=A0completed a beautiful=C2=A0Ganapati homa last August.=\r\n There is=C2=A0one divine chess player, and it is totally His game. \n=C2=A0=\r\n\nBefore I continue with the narration, I would like to mention a few points=\r\n which I found I had not clearly mentioned in my last mail:\n=C2=A0\n\nAt the =\r\nend of the third day of Chandi homa at Manikarnika samshan, we were standin=\r\ng and watching the pyres burn, when Manish suddenly said, in the coming day=\r\ns you will write about this experience in a public forum. Therefore my mail=\r\ns.\n=C2=A0\n\nCaveat: A homa on a funeral pyre is an extreme Aghor=C2=A0sadhan=\r\na, and it is not entirely risk free. Infact, in many paramparas it is said=\r\n=C2=A0only someone who has a direct agya from Samshan Kali or Mahakala can =\r\ntry this procedure, or someone who has agya from a powerful Guru. It was Ma=\r\nnish who was doing the homa, (giving ahutis)=C2=A0I was only doing the Chan=\r\ndi Path. Therefore, by reading this accounts one should not, on his own, tr=\r\ny out this sadhana. \n=C2=A0\n\nMany people have a negative=C2=A0bias towards =\r\nAghor sadhanas and Aghoris. This is party due to lack of knowledge or under=\r\nstanding of the philosophy and efficacy of these sadhanas. Moreover, in rec=\r\nent time some TV channels too have made films etc of Aghoris, potraying the=\r\nm as perverted individuals. This is grossly incorrect. They have no clue wh=\r\nat they are talking about, and their accounts start with many preconcieved =\r\nbiases. Aghora is one of the many path to the reach the same goals - Self-r=\r\nealization. It is neither bad nor good. It is a path. Some like it, some do=\r\nn&#39;t. Which is ok. We must follow our chosen path but at the same time have =\r\na healthy respect for other paths too. Many great saints and spiritual gian=\r\nts have taken this path. Guru Dattatreya is considered the first Aghori. Th=\r\ne 9 great Naths were all Aghoris. Sri Trilanga Swami was an Aghori too. Vim=\r\nalanada was a master Aghori. My mails are intended to give a first hand obj=\r\nective=C2=A0account of how a\n powerful sadhana in the samshan is performed.=\r\n Nothing more. I am just the cronicler.\n=C2=A0\n\nThere are many people in th=\r\nis age who have a desire for these sadhanas, who feel an attraction for thi=\r\ns kind of a path, but have no clue how to go about it. These accounts are m=\r\nent to tell such=C2=A0people that these sadhanas can and do happen even tod=\r\nay, it is not a figment of imagination. The Manikarnika is still as powerfu=\r\nl as it was thousands of years ago. But to go about it and=C2=A0actually be=\r\n able to do this sadhana, just like everything else in life, there is no fi=\r\nxed procedures or rules. Keep doing sadhana in whatever condition you are i=\r\nn right now=C2=A0and let Nature decide. Like Sai Baba says, Shradha and Sab=\r\nuri. Respect and patience. If the desire is genuine and deep, and one is re=\r\nady to wait, Nature will one day make arrangements. This is the eternal pro=\r\nmise to every individual=C2=A0because for Her, NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE. And S=\r\nhe is so=C2=A0kind.=C2=A0 In the intruduction to &quot;Aghora - At the left hand=\r\n of God&quot;, Vimalanada says :\n\n\n&quot;Publish this book after I am gone. Let peopl=\r\ne know the truth. Let them know what is what. Out of the thousands who may =\r\nread it at least a few will be sincere. They will try to learn more, and th=\r\nen Nature Herself will make arrangements for them to learn just as She did =\r\nfor me, and they will be taught according to their capabilities. The progre=\r\nssion will go on; there is nothing to fear&quot;.\nTherefore have faith, do sadha=\r\nna.=C2=A0 \n\n=C2=A0\nBack to the narration. The second day was Astami Tithi o=\r\nf Krishna Paksha. Manish said it is a powerful night for chita homa. Variou=\r\ns shaktis are available on this night which can destroy Ashuras.=C2=A0Past =\r\nmidnight we were walking towards Manikarnika along the ghats. Not a single =\r\nperson was to be seen anywhere on any of the multitude of ghats which we cr=\r\nossed. Suddenly we found a pack of dogs, fighting among each other, blockin=\r\ng our path. We stopped, wondering if there was any alternate route to the s=\r\namshan. I started mentally chanting a mantra I knew and praying to the deit=\r\ny to make our journey smooth. Coincidentally, just at that moment we saw a =\r\nman coming from the other side who chased the dogs away.=C2=A0Without looki=\r\nng at me=C2=A0Manish said, &quot;Sometimes a simple prayer can work wonders but =\r\nnever become to big for your breeches&quot;.\n=C2=A0\nAs we passed the Lalita Ghat=\r\n Manish said this is a wonderful place.=C2=A0I did not think too much about=\r\n it then since my mind was already pre occupied with the thoughts of what i=\r\ns to come. The next day morning when we again came to the Lalita Ghat for s=\r\nome shooting, I suddenly felt a pressure on my head, and then everything be=\r\ncame calm. Manish smiled at me and said this is where Trilanga Swami did hi=\r\ns tapashya and the energies are still here. I was little skeptical mentally=\r\n, since I knew that the samadhi of Trilanga Swami was at a different ghat, =\r\nhowever I did not say anything.=C2=A0Later on returning to Mumbai I spoke t=\r\no someone who was from Beneras and that person confirmed that indeed Trilan=\r\nga Swami used to stay at the Lalita Ghat and do his sadhana. Conclusion, I =\r\nam a confirmed idiot.\n=C2=A0\nBack to midnight. We reached Manikarnika and a=\r\ngain it was filled with people. But this time we did not wait. We went righ=\r\nt inside, and Manish kept looking for a suitable chita. As we came in, agai=\r\nn people started staring at us, but they respectfully made way for us to pa=\r\nss through to the middle of the samshan. We stood exactly at the middle, wi=\r\nth Manish observing the different chitas. There were about 8/10 of them bur=\r\nning. It is said in thousands of years there has not been a single minute w=\r\nhen there has not been a body burning in here. Therefore it is one of the M=\r\nahasamshans in India. There was one chita to my right which Manish was obse=\r\nrving, when suddenly I found a mega size bull come and stand right next to =\r\nthe fire. I did not want to sit there, the bull looked dangerous. Before I =\r\ncould voice my concern, Manish said let us go to the other side of the sams=\r\nhan. It not only the bull,=C2=A0 but there is something else as well. I did=\r\n not ask him what. So we\n went to another side. The dom there came forward =\r\nand said to Manish, &quot;Baba,aap log=C2=A0kaun se chita me baithna chahate ho?=\r\n&quot;. Manish indicated one at the end, the dome then went ahead and asked the =\r\npeople standing around the chita to make space for us to sit. He said the h=\r\neat from the fire is too stong, but Manish said it&#39;s ok, we&#39;ll sit here its=\r\nelf. There were many curious onlookers, but all made space for us to sit co=\r\nmfortably. I could hear the dom instructing others not to disturb the pyre =\r\nwe were sitting at. This is something very unique about Manikarnika. IN any=\r\n other city, people would have objected, but not here. Manish later said, i=\r\nt is a tradition of this place, Aghor sadhanas have been done in here for c=\r\nountless centuries. Therefore the domes have either themsleves seen these t=\r\nhings or heard from their families and thus they do not disturb. \n=C2=A0\nTh=\r\ne homa, as usual was awesome. The pyre was larger than the one previous nig=\r\nht. The heat was very strong. My focus was stronger. My mind was much calme=\r\nr than the previous night. Within ten minutes again a pack of dogs came and=\r\n sat around this pyre. This was strange because=C2=A0there were at least te=\r\nn pyres burning, and all of them chose this specific pyre for some inexplic=\r\nable reason. Dogs have a far subtler sense perception than average humans l=\r\nike me. This homa was extended longer. Every now and then Manish would sudd=\r\nenly look at a certain direction intently for a few second. I too would tur=\r\nn and look that way but saw nothing. But, everytime Manish looked at a spec=\r\nific direction or made some gestures, the dogs too would start barking at t=\r\nhat direction. At one point I almost felt a bit jealous of the dogs, they c=\r\nould see/sense things which I=C2=A0 - being such an=C2=A0ordinary person -=\r\n=C2=A0obviously had no clue about. In the middle of the Chandi path=C2=A0I =\r\ncould hear\n chants of &quot;Ram Nam Satya Hai&quot; and relatives wailing as new bodi=\r\nes were being brought in. \n=C2=A0\nSuddenly to my right there was a sound an=\r\nd quite abit of smoke, I saw a transformer bursting. The dogs immediately s=\r\ntarted barking at that. Later Manish said the Goddess was moving around, en=\r\ntering the fire and leaving the fire. The bursting of the transformer had a=\r\n link to this. As the Path was going on - the Chandi was in my right hand -=\r\n I saw a human shadow pass over=C2=A0the pages of the=C2=A0book. I thought =\r\nit was some relative who was standing behind me.=C2=A0I looked back and was=\r\n a shocked to find there was no one behind me. And the shadow passed over m=\r\ny book once again. This time I did not look back. Just kept chanting with m=\r\nore vigor and saying to myself &quot;all iz well&quot;-:).=C2=A0 Manish later said, a=\r\ns one does sadhana the deity often comes to observe and make his/her presen=\r\nce felt, even if slightly.=C2=A0It is not an imagination but reality and th=\r\nis can=C2=A0happen not just in a samshan but in any sadhana anywhere. The i=\r\ndea is to keep doing sadhana.\n=C2=A0\nWhile offering coconuts into the fire,=\r\n one coconut rolled off from the pyre. So I took a long bamboo stick which =\r\nthe domes use to stroke the fire and pushed the coconut piece inside.I wond=\r\nered if I=C2=A0had been a dom in any of my past lives, because I strangely =\r\nfelt natural stroking the pyre=C2=A0the way the domes do. I even wondered i=\r\nf=C2=A0there was any company which would may me for this kind of a job, I w=\r\nould happily take it. What better way to do sadhana than become a dom at Ma=\r\nnikarkina!=C2=A0Interestingly, I then remembered that Manish had bought one=\r\n extra coconut while buying the samagri to tonight&#39;s homas. Now I understoo=\r\nd why.\n=C2=A0\nIn the middle of the homa, suddenly Manish called one of the =\r\nrelatives who was standing nearby and told him=C2=A0that the person whos bo=\r\ndy was in the pyre has just left and that=C2=A0they (relatives) do not have=\r\n to wait any more. It was already late in the night. The person did not kno=\r\nw what to say. Suddenly Manish explained to him, do not worry, there is not=\r\nhing evil or bad being done here. We are only praying to Ma Durga. I guess =\r\nthe person was mentally wondering about what is going on. Then another of t=\r\nhe relatives came forward and said, &quot;Baba, hum log ahsirwad leke hi jayenge=\r\n&quot;. So Manish said ok and asked them to sit down and continued with the homa=\r\n. In the middle of the homa suddenly Manish asked me to observe the skin on=\r\n the corpse=C2=A0 I saw the skin on the face had caught fire and was burnin=\r\ng. It was a sight to see!\n=C2=A0\nThere is a tradition of pouring Ganges wat=\r\ner=C2=A0at the end to finsh the fire. But I could hear the domes telling th=\r\ne relatives not to pour water on the pyre or do anything there without perm=\r\nissin from Manish. Finally at the end they came to Manish and=C2=A0asked if=\r\n they could pour some Ganges water. Manish said ok, but in a low voice told=\r\n me nothing will happen to the fire, it won&#39;t die. They poured a large mud =\r\nkalash full of water but nothing happened to the fire. It kept burning. Aft=\r\ner some times, after some more ahutis, Manish called the people and said, &quot;=\r\n Devi=C2=A0samne khadi hai. App log pranam kijiye&quot;. At least 10/15 people c=\r\name forward and reventially bowed to the fire. Then they wanted to touch=C2=\r\n=A0Manish&#39;s feet, but Manish would not let them do so. They asked for his b=\r\nlessings. He distributed some flower petals we had and told them to go home=\r\n, since it was very late in the night. Suddenly the man, who had some doubt=\r\ns (whom Manish had addressed earlier) came\n running with tears in his eyes =\r\nasking for forgiveness for having doubted. Manish consoled him, told him no=\r\nthing to worry, he has done no wrong, everything is all right.=C2=A0 Later =\r\nManish said, if it was some other time of the day he would have brought the=\r\n man along for a cup of tea. Another person suddenly came to Manish and ask=\r\ned him if he was a certain saint (a famous saint)=C2=A0who used to live in =\r\nKasi. Manish without responding to his query asked him where was he from, t=\r\nhe person replied interior=C2=A0Bihar. Manish advised him to go back home a=\r\ns it was late in the night. The faith of the ordinary people of this land i=\r\ns what makes India so unique, that is why our land and culture is still so =\r\nalive. We city bred &#39;educated&#39;=C2=A0people are too rational to understand t=\r\nhese things. God loves the simple and uncalculating. By this time I too sto=\r\nod up to do pranam to the fire. Immediately I felt as if my body existed on=\r\nly from my head to my heart, there was nothing\n below, no legs, no stomach =\r\n,=C2=A0as if=C2=A0I was simply floating on thin=C2=A0air! I told Manish wha=\r\nt happened, he just gave a=C2=A0curt one word reply, &quot;Good&quot;.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nAs we were walking back from Manikarnika Manish suddenly said, &quot;Ther=\r\ne is a foreigner lady who lives close to Manikarnika, who has a lot of desi=\r\nre to perform sadhanas in the samshan but does not know how to go about it.=\r\n I saw her while meditating.&quot; For a woman to come and perform these sadhana=\r\ns is practically difficult or impossible, unless she is a Yogini or a sadha=\r\nka of great calibre. Ordinary people would not be able to meet the gaze of =\r\na Yogini, said Manish. The next morning, when we came to the Lalita Ghat (a=\r\ns I mentioned above), I saw a thin, frail, looking foreigner lady sitting o=\r\nn the banks. Manish quitely indicated to me that, that is the lady whom he =\r\nhad seen last night in his meditation at the samshan. &quot;She has desire, but =\r\ndirectionless. &quot; At that time there was nothing more we could do. I guess t=\r\nhat is why it is so important to keep doing some sadhana on your own, inste=\r\nad of merely contemplating which is of no good,=C2=A0so that you are ready =\r\nwhen\n Nature decides to give you a push. \n=C2=A0\nAfter passing the Lalita G=\r\nhat, next afternoon,=C2=A0we stood and observed Manikarnika from a distance=\r\n. We were dressed like any other tourist, specially with Manish&#39;s camera ha=\r\nnging from his neck=C2=A0and the=C2=A0tripod. Manish smiled and said let us=\r\n not go too close to Manikarnika, what if the doms recognize us! They would=\r\n be shell shocked seeing us dressed as tourists, wondering what is going on=\r\n.\n=C2=A0\nThus ended my second day of observing a Chandi homa on a funeral p=\r\nyre at the famed Manikarnika Ghats of Kashi.\n=C2=A0\n-Regards\nRajarshi\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n\n\nRama Naam Satya Hai\n\n\n\n\nThe INTERNET now has a personality.

I was writing in a flow and never checke=\r\nd what I wrote. Kindly pardon such errors and read through them. As they sa=\r\ny, &quot;Bhavnayoko samjho!&quot;.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;During the day time, we roamed around shooting at different =\r\nplaces. In this 3 days we never visited any of the temples in Kasi. I asked=\r\n him, &quot;What about the temples? Won&#39;t we visit them?&quot;. Manish retorted immed=\r\niately, &quot;&nbsp;Aren&#39;t we&nbsp;going to the most powerful temple in Kasi eve=\r\nry night?&quot;! I silently agreed. This is something about Manish I have observ=\r\ned. He rarely enters temples or standard places of worship, but suddenly he=\r\n might see a small roadside temple and stand and stare for sometimes, even =\r\ndo a pranam and then remark, &quot;There is something here.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;During evening we went to visit the Kinnaram Ashram. Kinnaram Bab=\r\na was a Aghori who lived in Kasi&nbsp;during the 16th century. The place is=\r\n called Aghor-sthal. Before entering Manish bought some bel leaves. As we w=\r\nalked inside the Ashram, Manish became silent, then said there are strong e=\r\nnergies in here. Inside we meditated for sometime, Manish did&nbsp; pranam&=\r\nnbsp;at the samadhi of Baba Bhagwan Ram who was the 11th head of the Ashram=\r\n. Baba Bhagwan Ram had entered Nirvikalpa Samadhi while meditating for 3 co=\r\nntinuous days at the Manikarnika Samshan.&nbsp; Manish, on being&nbsp;quest=\r\nioned, said that many sadhanas have been done here in this place for long b=\r\ny people with no mundane desires. Therefore, the energies are strong here. =\r\nWhile looking around the Ashram we found some quotations which were written=\r\n in small wooden boards. Manish called Arunisha and me and pointed to one q=\r\nuotation. Translated to English, it read, &quot;If you have to give your head\n o=\r\nff to get a sadguru, you have&nbsp;got it cheap&quot;.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;By 8 PM we sat for dinner. We used to have early dinners, so that we ha=\r\nd sufficient time before going to the samshan. Ideally you should have an e=\r\nmpty stomach while performing any sadhana to get the best effects. The amou=\r\nnt of fire in the body is fixed. There is one that digests food - Jathara A=\r\ngni. One that digests ideas/concepts/experiences - Bhuta Agni (existential =\r\nfire) which exists in the subtle body. It is the second which must increase=\r\n in order for one to &quot;digest&quot; various experiences/ideas/etc. It can only in=\r\ncrease when the Jathara Agni is less, i.e. you do not have a full stomach. =\r\nWhen we are extremely focused on something and working intently on the same=\r\n, we forget food, we do not feel hungry. This is due to the increase in Bhu=\r\nta Agni and decrease in Jathara Agni.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;As we sa=\r\nt eating our food and talking on different topics, we discussed history.The=\r\n conversation mentioned here is a thread picked up from an earlier conversa=\r\ntion that we (Manish, Arunisha and&nbsp;me) had before coming to Kasi. &lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Manish said, &quot;It is the same set of&nbsp;souls wh=\r\no come back&nbsp;again and again in different bodies and personalities at d=\r\nifferent times, who&nbsp;are responsible for this land. There was Chadragup=\r\nta and Chanakya, there was Prithviraj, there was Akbar, Shankaracharya, Ram=\r\nakrishna etc.&quot; He continued, &quot;They can come as kings, yogis, or any other f=\r\norm which is necessary for them to accomplish their dharma. And their dharm=\r\na is connected to this land&nbsp;which we call India&nbsp;today.This land i=\r\ns connected to the Rishis. This is Rishi bhoomi. And Rishis sent people whe=\r\nn needed.&nbsp;Prithviraj made one mistake, of pardoning Ghori. Imagine wha=\r\nt happened to that woman who made Prithiviraj disobey his Guru?&quot;.I silently=\r\n contemplated her fate.&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;One very senior=\r\n Rishi has decided to&nbsp;change this land back to a Rishi bhoomi. And so =\r\nshall it happen.&nbsp;Ved&nbsp;Dharma will be re established here along the=\r\n length and breadth. Nothing, however powerful or mightly, be it an individ=\r\nual or&nbsp;group,&nbsp;can stand against the will of a Rishi.&quot;&nbsp; Aruni=\r\nsha asked a pertinent question here. &quot;What were the Rishis doing for&nbsp;o=\r\nne thousand years?&quot;. Manish laughed and said, &quot; A Rishi can very well spend=\r\n a thousand years simply in samadhi, meditating. Then suddenly&nbsp;one day=\r\n&nbsp;wake up from meditation&nbsp;and see that Rishi bhoomi is gone&nbsp;a=\r\nnd all sorts of non-spiritual things going on here. So He decides, it is ti=\r\nme to get back and re create the Rishi bhoomi. You guys have no clue about&=\r\nnbsp;what a Rishi can do. One Rishi is enough to change a universe, changin=\r\ng a country is child&#39;s play for Him.&quot; Wow. I let all these sink inside me s=\r\nlowly. Therefore it is so important to keep\n doing sadhana, in some manner =\r\nor the other.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;As night approached midnight, Ma=\r\nnish and I left for the Manikarnika again. This was going be our last night=\r\n of Chandi homa at Manikarnika, for now. We walked long the&nbsp;deserted g=\r\nhats, sliently. I asked him if it is ok doing a&nbsp;homa of Shiva/Bhairava=\r\n on a pyre. He said&nbsp;yes why not, but without Shakti, there will be no =\r\nShiva. Worshipping the divine feminie is the most practical strategy of sad=\r\nhana. Shiva is the state of highest consciousness, and to reach that stage =\r\none must develop his body and mind such that it can hold shakti&nbsp;for wh=\r\nich&nbsp;worshipping the divine Mother is the best way.&nbsp;That is why Vi=\r\nmalananda says, &quot;Let the Mother show you the face of the Father&quot;. The topic=\r\n drifted to Vimalananda. Manish said, &quot;Kala Bhairava is very strong in Mani=\r\nkarnika, where as Mahakala exists powerfully in the cremation grouds at Ujj=\r\nain. But Vimalananda did Mahakala sadhana here in Manikarnika.&quot; Then starin=\r\ng at the pitch black ganges,\n Manish chuckled lightly and added, &quot;That man =\r\nwas something.&quot; This was again an old conversation we had started&nbsp;befo=\r\nre which Mainsh continued, &quot;All these babas of today would wet their pants =\r\nif Vimalananda were to stand infornt of them. Those three books have the po=\r\nwer of a deity flowing through them. Without being physically present, Vima=\r\nlananda has created a army of sadhakas!&quot;. I interjected, &quot;The books&nbsp;ar=\r\ne like a Bible&nbsp;for sadhakas,&nbsp;arn&#39;t they?&quot;. &quot;Yes&quot; said Manish. Lat=\r\ner on I asked him if it was possible for someone to meet Vimalanada, to whi=\r\nch Manish replied that yes it was, if one does serious sadhana. However, th=\r\ne important question is whether one will be able to recognize him. I fell s=\r\nilent hearing this. Interestingly, in the 2nd book of the Aghora series, Vi=\r\nmalanda does mention that a time will come when his &quot;children&quot; would spread=\r\n homas. Strange, or maybe not so. Who knows how deep things run. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;We reached the samshan by half past twelve. This time w=\r\ne sat at the same place where we had sat on the first day of homa. The fire=\r\n was low. Most of the body had been burnt already. Manish started the homa.=\r\n As usual, all the dogs came and sat peacefully around the fire. Now this d=\r\nid not surprise me any more. In the middle of the homa Manish would slowly =\r\nlift his&nbsp;palm upwards&nbsp;and with the next ahuti&nbsp;immediately th=\r\ne fire would leap higher. He did this quite a few times, when&nbsp;the flam=\r\nes were getting weaker. I countinued with the Chandi path and passing on th=\r\ne samagri to him as and when he required anything. One dom who was working =\r\non a pyre nearby, came towards us and exclaimed,&quot;Jai Mahadev&quot;. Manish too r=\r\nesponded back, &quot;Jai Mahadev&quot;. This homa was faster. He did not use any &quot;sam=\r\nputs&quot;, but a direct, straight Chandi homa. Again in the middle I got up and=\r\n stroked the pyre a bit, pushing around some of the coconut pieces to make =\r\nthem\n burn properly. I was enjoying it. A few people came and sat near us, =\r\nlistening to the path. In Kasi there is a rule that whatever comes in the S=\r\namshan is the property of the Dom Raja (the head of doms). No one has any f=\r\nurther claim on it. In old times, one Dom Raja was called Kallu Dom. He was=\r\n an Aghori and a contemporary of Kinnaram Baba. It is said he could raise t=\r\nhe dead back to life. Maybe it is because of this tradition that Manikarnik=\r\na is such an apt place for these sadhanas. I was at one point mentally wond=\r\nering why are there so many people in the samshan. The Manish said, if a Na=\r\nth came here in his garb, everyone will run away from the samshan scared. B=\r\nut there is a reason why there are people here even so late in the night.&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Once the final purnahuti was given, we sat for =\r\nmeditation. Though this homa got over faster than previous days, the medita=\r\ntion that happened, for me, was superb. At one point I felt as if my mind w=\r\nould just burst forth and expand across the length and breadth of the Gange=\r\ns. My focus was good, but I had to open my eyes after every 20 minutes or s=\r\no. Manish continued meditating for nearly an hour. Not the slightest moveme=\r\nnt from him. Nothing. Still like a stone. Then a cow came and slightly nudg=\r\ned Manish on his feet. That made him open his eyes. Manish remarked, &quot; I co=\r\nuld have just left my body and gone off. It did not matter that I had a fli=\r\nght to catch the next day, or anything else. I was on the verge of death. J=\r\nust at that moment the cow and brought me back.&quot; Smiling he added, &quot;What a =\r\nsight it would have been for the people to see, how the body can be left at=\r\n will&quot;.&nbsp; I did not know what to say. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;We =\r\nstood there watching another pyre in front. The body was half burnt. The to=\r\nrso had become black with deep&nbsp;red patches all over. The dom came forw=\r\nard, and with the bamboo stick inserted it (the bamboo stick)&nbsp;from the=\r\n side of the corpse, lifting up the burning torso into the air and placing =\r\nit again, strategically, in the middle of the pyre. The smooth&nbsp;motion =\r\nof lifting up the half burnt torso, sticking out from one end of the bamboo=\r\n stick,&nbsp;into the thin, dark, night-air reminded me of how we use a for=\r\nk to lift pieces of food - meat&nbsp;or vegetables, both dead -&nbsp;from o=\r\nur plates to our mouths. Manish asked me smiling, &quot;Maza aya?&quot;. I smiled bac=\r\nk in acknowledgement. Then he commented&nbsp;that I should write about this=\r\n experience in the coming days. Let people know.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;By this time I remembered that when I was sitting and doing the Chandi p=\r\nath, one dog&nbsp;had run off with one of my chappals. I informed Manish. H=\r\ne exclaimed, &quot; Kya baat hai! Leave the other chappal here as well.&quot; Manish =\r\nsaid we had a rna with this samshan. We had been here before, in some life.=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;As we were returning, Manish said one of the =\r\npoint (the three peaks)&nbsp;of Shiva&#39;s trishul passes through the Manikark=\r\nina. Therefore, it is a &quot;safe&quot; samshan. Anyone who tries anything negative =\r\nhere will face troubles. The trishul of Shiva guards this place. No spirit =\r\nwill cause any unnecessary disturbance inside the samshan. That is also why=\r\n there are people here even at 2 am in the morning. There is safety in numb=\r\ners. As long as ones intentions are genuine and good, Manikarnika is a wond=\r\nerful place to do sadhana.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;While walking along=\r\n the ghats&nbsp;which were&nbsp;totally deserted, Manish instructed me not =\r\nto stop. The knot in my red lungi was becoming loose, I caught hold of it&n=\r\nbsp;with one&nbsp;hand and kept moving fast, trying to keep pace with Manis=\r\nh. Later Manish asked me if I had got some smell. I thought and recollected=\r\n that yes, I did get a faint smell of heena. Twice. Manish told me it was a=\r\n &quot;Mokul&quot;. A muslim spirit of similar level as a Yaksha or a Yakshini. Once =\r\nthe ritual is over, and you are out of the samshan, do not wait along the b=\r\nanks, he instructed. Do not move too close to the water&nbsp;late in the ni=\r\nghtt. There are things in the water. Generally they may not do anything, bu=\r\nt why take a chance. The protection of Shiva is only inside the Manikarnika=\r\n Ghat. Then he added, Deoriya Baba (I may have mis-spelt the name) used to =\r\nlive in the middle of this Ganges 24/7. This is a city of saints. Here God-=\r\nintoxicated Paramhamsas would roam around\n naked. It is their city.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Next morning, as we sat recollecting the previous nig=\r\nht&#39;s homa, Manish talked about Vedas.&nbsp;Few sadhaks, if ever, are equall=\r\ny comfortable with both paths of&nbsp;Aghora and Vedas. For a Veda mantra t=\r\no show its effects, one must get the intonation perfect. This age most peop=\r\nle cannot do that. I&nbsp;enquired that I had heard from someone that a cer=\r\ntain procedure needs to be done before one starts any sadhana in the samsha=\r\nn. Manish&nbsp;laughed and replied,&nbsp;&quot;Karna to sab kuch chahiye, par mu=\r\njhe to kuch nehi aata!&quot;.&nbsp;I was dumbstruck.&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;While talking about Ramayana with Arunisha, his eyes suddenly becom=\r\ne half closed. He voice became slow and heavy,&nbsp;&quot;The color of Rama&#39;s bo=\r\ndy is deep blue with a golden tinge all&nbsp;around him. Like a sun blazing=\r\n. That&nbsp;was the kavacha given to Rama by Vishwamitra, the real Gayatri =\r\nwith two special samputs. It was impenetrable. And when he shot his arrows,=\r\n the motion of his hands&nbsp;is so fast that a normal human eye will not a=\r\nble to observe. In 12 hours he had destroyed a forest of Ashuras.&nbsp;Rava=\r\nna had a Chandrahaas khadga. It was a&nbsp;mantra shakti he had acquired th=\r\nrough sadhana. The Khadga had become part of his right hand, which would fl=\r\ny off to kill mercilessly at the slightest&nbsp;command from his mind. Such=\r\n was the calibre of the enemy. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;And Rama remov=\r\ned even&nbsp;his Gayatri Kavacha, and fought like a normal human being when=\r\n he defeated Ravana which&nbsp;means; he even removed the last vestige of h=\r\nis ego of being a God, and fought like a human. Is it any wonder then, that=\r\n the whole of north India goes crazy at the mere mention of the name of Sri=\r\n Rama?&quot;. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;He spoke with such an energy which c=\r\nannot be defined, as if he was there and seen it all. Rama Naam Satya Hai.&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Thus ends my recounting of our fascinating tri=\r\np to Kasi.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=\r\n=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DCourie=\r\nr color=3D#000000 size=3D3&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#00007f&gt;Rama Naama Satya Hai..&lt;/FO=\r\nNT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Sat, =\r\n16/1/10, rajarshi nandy &lt;I&gt;&lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: rg=\r\nb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Rama Naam Satya Hai - 2&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdom=\r\n@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Saturday, 16 January, 2010, 11:25 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n id=3Dyiv252821719&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;DISPLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dy=\r\ngrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;TABLE cellSpacing=3D0 cellPadding=3D0 border=3D0&gt;\n&lt;TBODY&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;TR&gt;\n&lt;TD vAlign=3Dtop&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Dear Narasimha&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM=\r\n&gt;It may sound weird, but this is what happens in real life all the time. Yo=\r\nu, I, all these people are pieces in another kind of chess game. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Great analogy. Manish had given this analogy to us=\r\n after he&nbsp;completed a beautiful&nbsp;Ganapati homa last August. There =\r\nis&nbsp;one divine chess player, and it is totally His game. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Before I continue with the narration, I would like to menti=\r\non a few points which I found I had not clearly mentioned in my last mail:&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;UL&gt;\n&lt;LI&gt;At the end of the third day of Chandi homa=\r\n at Manikarnika samshan, we were standing and watching the pyres burn, when=\r\n Manish suddenly said, in the coming days you will write about this experie=\r\nnce in a public forum. Therefore my mails.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;UL&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Caveat&lt;/STRONG&gt;: A homa on a funeral pyre is an extreme Aghor&=\r\nnbsp;sadhana, and it is not entirely risk free. Infact, in many paramparas =\r\nit is said&nbsp;only someone who has a direct agya from Samshan Kali or Mah=\r\nakala can try this procedure, or someone who has agya from a powerful Guru.=\r\n It was Manish who was doing the homa, (giving ahutis)&nbsp;I was only doin=\r\ng the Chandi Path. Therefore, by reading this accounts one should not, on h=\r\nis own, try out this sadhana. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;UL&gt;\n&lt;LI&gt;Many pe=\r\nople have a negative&nbsp;bias towards Aghor sadhanas and Aghoris. This is =\r\nparty due to lack of knowledge or understanding of the philosophy and effic=\r\nacy of these sadhanas. Moreover, in recent time some TV channels too have m=\r\nade films etc of Aghoris, potraying them as perverted individuals. This is =\r\ngrossly incorrect. They have no clue what they are talking about, and their=\r\n accounts start with many preconcieved biases. Aghora is one of the many pa=\r\nth to the reach the same goals - Self-realization. It is neither bad nor go=\r\nod. It is a path. Some like it, some don&#39;t. Which is ok. We must follow our=\r\n chosen path but at the same time have a healthy respect for other paths to=\r\no. Many great saints and spiritual giants have taken this path. Guru Dattat=\r\nreya is considered the first Aghori. The 9 great Naths were all Aghoris. Sr=\r\ni Trilanga Swami was an Aghori too. Vimalanada was a master Aghori. My mail=\r\ns are intended to give a first hand\n objective&nbsp;account of how a powerf=\r\nul sadhana in the samshan is performed. Nothing more. I am just the cronicl=\r\ner.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;UL&gt;\n&lt;LI&gt;There are many people in this age =\r\nwho have a desire for these sadhanas, who feel an attraction for this kind =\r\nof a path, but have no clue how to go about it. These accounts are ment to =\r\ntell such&nbsp;people that these sadhanas can and do happen even today, it =\r\nis not a figment of imagination. The Manikarnika is still as powerful as it=\r\n was thousands of years ago. But to go about it and&nbsp;actually be able t=\r\no do this sadhana, just like everything else in life, there is no fixed pro=\r\ncedures or rules. Keep doing sadhana in whatever condition you are in right=\r\n now&nbsp;and let Nature decide. Like Sai Baba says, Shradha and Saburi. Re=\r\nspect and patience. If the desire is genuine and deep, and one is ready to =\r\nwait, Nature will one day make arrangements. This is the eternal promise to=\r\n every individual&nbsp;because for Her, NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE. And She is s=\r\no&nbsp;kind.&nbsp; In the intruduction to &quot;Aghora - At the left hand of God=\r\n&quot;, Vimalanada says :&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE dir=3Dltr&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE dir=3Dltr=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;Publish this book after I am gone. Let people know the truth. Let t=\r\nhem know what is what. Out of the thousands who may read it at least a few =\r\nwill be sincere. They will try to learn more, and then Nature Herself will =\r\nmake arrangements for them to learn just as She did for me, and they will b=\r\ne taught according to their capabilities. &lt;U&gt;The progression will go on; th=\r\nere is nothing to fear&lt;/U&gt;&quot;.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;\n&lt;P dir=3Dltr&gt;Therefore have=\r\n faith, do sadhana.&nbsp; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\nBack to the narration. The second day was Astami Tithi of Krishna Paksha. M=\r\nanish said it is a powerful night for chita homa. Various shaktis are avail=\r\nable on this night which can destroy Ashuras.&nbsp;Past midnight we were wa=\r\nlking towards Manikarnika along the ghats. Not a single person was to be se=\r\nen anywhere on any of the multitude of ghats which we crossed. Suddenly we =\r\nfound a pack of dogs, fighting among each other, blocking our path. We stop=\r\nped, wondering if there was any alternate route to the samshan. I started m=\r\nentally chanting a mantra I knew and praying to the deity to make our journ=\r\ney smooth. Coincidentally, just at that moment we saw a man coming from the=\r\n other side who chased the dogs away.&nbsp;Without looking at me&nbsp;Manis=\r\nh said, &quot;Sometimes a simple prayer can work wonders but never become to big=\r\n for your breeches&quot;.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;As we passed the Lalita G=\r\nhat Manish said this is a wonderful place.&nbsp;I did not think too much ab=\r\nout it then since my mind was already pre occupied with the thoughts of wha=\r\nt is to come. The next day morning when we again came to the Lalita Ghat fo=\r\nr some shooting, I suddenly felt a pressure on my head, and then everything=\r\n became calm. Manish smiled at me and said this is where Trilanga Swami did=\r\n his tapashya and the energies are still here. I was little skeptical menta=\r\nlly, since I knew that the samadhi of Trilanga Swami was at a different gha=\r\nt, however I did not say anything.&nbsp;Later on returning to Mumbai I spok=\r\ne to someone who was from Beneras and that person confirmed that indeed Tri=\r\nlanga Swami used to stay at the Lalita Ghat and do his sadhana. Conclusion,=\r\n I am a confirmed idiot.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Back to midnight. We =\r\nreached Manikarnika and again it was filled with people. But this time we d=\r\nid not wait. We went right inside, and Manish kept looking for a suitable c=\r\nhita. As we came in, again people started staring at us, but they respectfu=\r\nlly made way for us to pass through to the middle of the samshan. We stood =\r\nexactly at the middle, with Manish observing the different chitas. There we=\r\nre about 8/10 of them burning. It is said in thousands of years there has n=\r\not been a single minute when there has not been a body burning in here. The=\r\nrefore it is one of the Mahasamshans in India. There was one chita to my ri=\r\nght which Manish was observing, when suddenly I found a mega size bull come=\r\n and stand right next to the fire. I did not want to sit there, the bull lo=\r\noked dangerous. Before I could voice my concern, Manish said let us go to t=\r\nhe other side of the samshan. It not only the bull,&nbsp; but there is some=\r\nthing else as well. I did not ask him\n what. So we went to another side. Th=\r\ne dom there came forward and said to Manish, &quot;Baba,aap log&nbsp;kaun se chi=\r\nta me baithna chahate ho?&quot;. Manish indicated one at the end, the dome then =\r\nwent ahead and asked the people standing around the chita to make space for=\r\n us to sit. He said the heat from the fire is too stong, but Manish said it=\r\n&#39;s ok, we&#39;ll sit here itself. There were many curious onlookers, but all ma=\r\nde space for us to sit comfortably. I could hear the dom instructing others=\r\n not to disturb the pyre we were sitting at. This is something very unique =\r\nabout Manikarnika. IN any other city, people would have objected, but not h=\r\nere. Manish later said, it is a tradition of this place, Aghor sadhanas hav=\r\ne been done in here for countless centuries. Therefore the domes have eithe=\r\nr themsleves seen these things or heard from their families and thus they d=\r\no not disturb. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The homa, as usual was awesome=\r\n. The pyre was larger than the one previous night. The heat was very strong=\r\n. My focus was stronger. My mind was much calmer than the previous night. W=\r\nithin ten minutes again a pack of dogs came and sat around this pyre. This =\r\nwas strange because&nbsp;there were at least ten pyres burning, and all of =\r\nthem chose this specific pyre for some inexplicable reason. Dogs have a far=\r\n subtler sense perception than average humans like me. This homa was extend=\r\ned longer. Every now and then Manish would suddenly look at a certain direc=\r\ntion intently for a few second. I too would turn and look that way but saw =\r\nnothing. But, everytime Manish looked at a specific direction or made some =\r\ngestures, the dogs too would start barking at that direction. At one point =\r\nI almost felt a bit jealous of the dogs, they could see/sense things which =\r\nI&nbsp; - being such an&nbsp;ordinary person -&nbsp;obviously had no clue a=\r\nbout. In the middle of the Chandi\n path&nbsp;I could hear chants of &quot;Ram Na=\r\nm Satya Hai&quot; and relatives wailing as new bodies were being brought in. &lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Suddenly to my right there was a sound and quite=\r\n abit of smoke, I saw a transformer bursting. The dogs immediately started =\r\nbarking at that. Later Manish said the Goddess was moving around, entering =\r\nthe fire and leaving the fire. The bursting of the transformer had a link t=\r\no this. As the Path was going on - the Chandi was in my right hand - I saw =\r\na human shadow pass over&nbsp;the pages of the&nbsp;book. I thought it was =\r\nsome relative who was standing behind me.&nbsp;I looked back and was a shoc=\r\nked to find there was no one behind me. And the shadow passed over my book =\r\nonce again. This time I did not look back. Just kept chanting with more vig=\r\nor and saying to myself &quot;all iz well&quot;-:).&nbsp; Manish later said, as one d=\r\noes sadhana the deity often comes to observe and make his/her presence felt=\r\n, even if slightly.&nbsp;It is not an imagination but reality and this can&=\r\nnbsp;happen not just in a samshan but in any sadhana anywhere. The idea is =\r\nto keep doing\n sadhana.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;While offering coconut=\r\ns into the fire, one coconut rolled off from the pyre. So I took a long bam=\r\nboo stick which the domes use to stroke the fire and pushed the coconut pie=\r\nce inside.I wondered if I&nbsp;had been a dom in any of my past lives, beca=\r\nuse I strangely felt natural stroking the pyre&nbsp;the way the domes do. I=\r\n even wondered if&nbsp;there was any company which would may me for this ki=\r\nnd of a job, I would happily take it. What better way to do sadhana than be=\r\ncome a dom at Manikarkina!&nbsp;Interestingly, I then remembered that Manis=\r\nh had bought one extra coconut while buying the samagri to tonight&#39;s homas.=\r\n Now I understood why.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;In the middle of the ho=\r\nma, suddenly Manish called one of the relatives who was standing nearby and=\r\n told him&nbsp;that the person whos body was in the pyre has just left and =\r\nthat&nbsp;they (relatives) do not have to wait any more. It was already lat=\r\ne in the night. The person did not know what to say. Suddenly Manish explai=\r\nned to him, do not worry, there is nothing evil or bad being done here. We =\r\nare only praying to Ma Durga. I guess the person was mentally wondering abo=\r\nut what is going on. Then another of the relatives came forward and said, &quot;=\r\nBaba, hum log ahsirwad leke hi jayenge&quot;. So Manish said ok and asked them t=\r\no sit down and continued with the homa. In the middle of the homa suddenly =\r\nManish asked me to observe the skin on the corpse&nbsp; I saw the skin on t=\r\nhe face had caught fire and was burning. It was a sight to see!&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;There is a tradition of pouring Ganges water&nbsp;at the =\r\nend to finsh the fire. But I could hear the domes telling the relatives not=\r\n to pour water on the pyre or do anything there without permissin from Mani=\r\nsh. Finally at the end they came to Manish and&nbsp;asked if they could pou=\r\nr some Ganges water. Manish said ok, but in a low voice told me nothing wil=\r\nl happen to the fire, it won&#39;t die. They poured a large mud kalash full of =\r\nwater but nothing happened to the fire. It kept burning. After some times, =\r\nafter some more ahutis, Manish called the people and said, &quot; Devi&nbsp;samn=\r\ne khadi hai. App log pranam kijiye&quot;. At least 10/15 people came forward and=\r\n reventially bowed to the fire. Then they wanted to touch&nbsp;Manish&#39;s fee=\r\nt, but Manish would not let them do so. They asked for his blessings. He di=\r\nstributed some flower petals we had and told them to go home, since it was =\r\nvery late in the night. Suddenly the man, who had some doubts (whom Manish =\r\nhad\n addressed earlier) came running with tears in his eyes asking for forg=\r\niveness for having doubted. Manish consoled him, told him nothing to worry,=\r\n he has done no wrong, everything is all right.&nbsp; Later Manish said, if=\r\n it was some other time of the day he would have brought the man along for =\r\na cup of tea. Another person suddenly came to Manish and asked him if he wa=\r\ns a certain saint (a famous saint)&nbsp;who used to live in Kasi. Manish wi=\r\nthout responding to his query asked him where was he from, the person repli=\r\ned interior&nbsp;Bihar. Manish advised him to go back home as it was late i=\r\nn the night. The faith of the ordinary people of this land is what makes In=\r\ndia so unique, that is why our land and culture is still so alive. We city =\r\nbred &#39;educated&#39;&nbsp;people are too rational to understand these things. Go=\r\nd loves the simple and uncalculating. By this time I too stood up to do pra=\r\nnam to the fire. Immediately I felt as if my body existed only from my\n hea=\r\nd to my heart, there was nothing below, no legs, no stomach ,&nbsp;as if&nb=\r\nsp;I was simply floating on thin&nbsp;air! I told Manish what happened, he =\r\njust gave a&nbsp;curt one word reply, &quot;Good&quot;.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;As we were walking back from Manikarnik=\r\na Manish suddenly said, &quot;There is a foreigner lady who lives close to Manik=\r\narnika, who has a lot of desire to perform sadhanas in the samshan but does=\r\n not know how to go about it. I saw her while meditating.&quot; For a woman to c=\r\nome and perform these sadhanas is practically difficult or impossible, unle=\r\nss she is a Yogini or a sadhaka of great calibre. Ordinary people would not=\r\n be able to meet the gaze of a Yogini, said Manish. The next morning, when =\r\nwe came to the Lalita Ghat (as I mentioned above), I saw a thin, frail, loo=\r\nking foreigner lady sitting on the banks. Manish quitely indicated to me th=\r\nat, that is the lady whom he had seen last night in his meditation at the s=\r\namshan. &quot;She has desire, but directionless. &quot; At that time there was nothin=\r\ng more we could do. I guess that is why it is so important to keep doing so=\r\nme sadhana on your own, instead of merely contemplating which is of no good=\r\n,&nbsp;so that you are\n ready when Nature decides to give you a push. &lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;After passing the Lalita Ghat, next afternoon,&nbs=\r\np;we stood and observed Manikarnika from a distance. We were dressed like a=\r\nny other tourist, specially with Manish&#39;s camera hanging from his neck&nbsp=\r\n;and the&nbsp;tripod. Manish smiled and said let us not go too close to Man=\r\nikarnika, what if the doms recognize us! They would be shell shocked seeing=\r\n us dressed as tourists, wondering what is going on.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Thus ended my second day of observing a Chandi homa on a funeral pyr=\r\ne at the famed Manikarnika Ghats of Kashi.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Re=\r\ngards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Rajarshi&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FO=\r\nNT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DCourier color=3D#000000 size=3D3&gt;&lt;FONT col=\r\nor=3D#00007f&gt;Rama Naam Satya Hai&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRON=\r\nG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;HR SIZE=3D1&gt;\nThe INTER=\r\nNET now has a personality.
