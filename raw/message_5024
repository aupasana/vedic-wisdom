I am requesting you =\r\nto respond to the following questions of mine. \n&gt;  \n&gt; 1. With your blessing=\r\ns, I was able to perform 40 day Ganapati homam that ended with Vinayaka cha=\r\nturthi. Since Ganapathi moola mantram itself ends with Swaha, I was adding =\r\none more swaha after the first Swaha to offer in the homam. Along the way, =\r\nOnce I heard your mp3 recording and you were saying only once &#39;swaha&#39;. Did =\r\nI make a mistake?\n&gt;  \n&gt; 2. Are there specific homams for Gayatri and Kartik=\r\neya forms of the divine?\n&gt;  \n&gt; 3. Wanted to know your opinion on Rambhav Sw=\r\nami videos that were discussed on this forum a while ago, if you had a chan=\r\nce to view them.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Nagaraj\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sat, 10/2/10, Narasimha PVR Rao =\r\n&lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Miscellaneous replies\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com\n&gt; Date: Saturday, October 2, 2010, 7:29 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Na=\r\nmaste Priya,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; When I do vishnu Homam I say Lord Vishnu I surrender to=\r\n you, later I read\n&gt; &gt; Durga Saptashati I say mother I surrender to you, th=\r\nen I visit Shiva temple\n&gt; &gt; I say I surrender to you. What I am trying to a=\r\nsk is..should one surrender\n&gt; &gt; to any God we come across or loyalty toward=\r\ns one God is important? If\n&gt; &gt; loyalty is important then can I read Durga S=\r\naptashati and say although I\n&gt; &gt; am praying to you mother I surrender to Lo=\r\nrd vishnu only? \n&gt; \n&gt; Do not think of it in terms of loyalty. Gods are not =\r\nlike egoistic people who compete with others and have qualities like possis=\r\nsiveness, jealosy etc. Gods are different aspects of (and pathways to) the =\r\nSupreme.\n&gt; \n&gt; All gods are slightly different emanations of the supreme cos=\r\nmic being, who may also be called &quot;the Self of all&quot;. In order to realize Se=\r\nlf, one needs to reach the supreme cosmic being. That can be done through v=\r\narious gods. First develop attachment to one god, appreciate his/her qualit=\r\nies, think of him/her all the time and reach him/her. Then you can reach th=\r\ne supreme cosmic being through that god.\n&gt; \n&gt; One who is most attached to V=\r\nishnu/Lakshmi/Shiva/Durga/Ganesha/Surya should look at that god as the supr=\r\neme god from whom all gods emanate. All other gods are created from that go=\r\nd and rest in that god. It is fine to worship various gods, thinking that t=\r\nhey are all different manifestations of the god one is attached to.\n&gt; \n&gt; If=\r\n one has not found a god one is attached to and about whom one can think li=\r\nke this, then one may have to look more.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; During navratri is it ok to=\r\n read devi mahatmyam when a women has her\n&gt; &gt; periods? If no then what can =\r\nshe do to acheive the maximum benefit?\n&gt; \n&gt; In my personal opinion, it is o=\r\nk to read mentally. If you do external rituals like homam, idol worship etc=\r\n, however, I suggest not doing them during periods and to read mentally ins=\r\ntead. This is particularly true for homam. While I do not fully understand =\r\nthe rationale through personal experience, I like to respect the words of t=\r\nradition and of people who know more than me.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; My homam fire is small=\r\n so just wondering if it is ok to put chopped basil\n&gt; &gt; leaves,chopped bete=\r\nl leaves or should one put whole leaf only. I always see\n&gt; &gt; you use the wo=\r\nrds whole turmeric, whole lemon etc hence this doubt. \n&gt; \n&gt; Yes. Undivided =\r\nand full parts are better, but offering something compatible with the size =\r\nof your fire and making sure that it burns fully and comfortably is the mos=\r\nt important criterion. So feel free to pur chopped things.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nNamaste Mitesh,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the tarpana process we invite all ancestors in th=\r\ne copper vessel\n&gt; &gt; but in the end what should we do, request them to go ba=\r\nck to their respective places?\n&gt; \n&gt; The mantra used for invocation does not=\r\n ask for ancestors to enter the water in the kalasha. It asks them to come =\r\nto the area to receive the water offering. When they are satisfied with the=\r\n sesame water, they leave. Explicit sendoff is not done in the tradition I =\r\nam familiar with. If one feels uncomfortable and wants to send off formally=\r\n, one can say &quot;OM pitruun yathaasthaanam sthaapayaami&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also is it o=\r\nk to tarpana in the night say 8 or 9 pm?\n&gt; \n&gt; It is not ideal, but it is be=\r\ntter to do sometime than not to do at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste Ashok,\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &quot;At the end of pitru-tarpanam, the following needs to be said in conc=\r\nlusion:\n&gt; &gt; &quot;narake=C3=B1u samaste=C3=B1u y=C3=A4tan=C3=A4su...&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; C=\r\nan you clarify the meaning also?\n&gt; \n&gt; The verse &quot;narakeshu samasteshu&quot; at t=\r\nhe end means: &quot;Whoever are stuck in various hells (inauspicious realms of e=\r\nxistence in which mind can be stuck after death) and suffering there, I am =\r\noffering this water for them, thinking of their relief.&quot;. The next 4 verses=\r\n pray for the relief of relatives, non-relatives and relatives in previous =\r\nlives and people born in one&#39;s lineage without spouse/children and all bein=\r\ngs of the universe.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste Parijat,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; at the same tim=\r\ne....narasimha ji told in one of the mails........\n&gt; &gt; &quot;mother knows the be=\r\nst&quot;...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; these have removed the misconceptions i had ...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; wh=\r\nat i want to know is when one is devoted to maa why does she test ??.....\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; is it a way to bring one closer to her through realizations ??...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; when shes the all pervading shakti....why thers a need for test ??....al=\r\nso...\n&gt; &gt; while testing does she give her child &gt; enuff\n&gt; &gt; strength to pas=\r\ns the test ??\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; i am looking forward to guidance from u people...\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Words come with baggage and may mean different things to different peopl=\r\ne depending on their life experiences and outlook in life.
