It might be my half baked theo=\r\nry and forgive me for any mistakes beforehand.\n\nDoctors and Scientists agre=\r\ne after a decade of research that the body has a bio magnetic field associa=\r\nted with it.The Brain MRI is based on this principle. We also have very tin=\r\ny cell potentials across all the cells in the human body. \n\nThe blood flows=\r\n from the heart to various organs and the direction is usually top to botto=\r\nm. From Faraday&#39;s law of electromagnetism which we studied in high school.I=\r\nf you place your thumb in the direction of the flow of current the fingers =\r\nwhen wrapped will point the direction of the magnetic field. The pranic cur=\r\nrent is in the same direction as blood flow.\n\nThat is why the Shirshasana w=\r\nhich reverses the blood flow is highly praised in yoga. Anywaz with the dir=\r\nection of flow of blood we get a North pole orientation for the head and so=\r\nuth pole orientation for the feet.\n\nLike poles repel and hence if you place=\r\n your head in the Northern direction you might experience more dreams due t=\r\no the opposing poles and hence disturbed sleep.\n\nThe ancients beleived in s=\r\npiritualizaiton of sleep since a average human being spends a lot of time i=\r\nn sleep. Hence could have advised the southern direction to avoid this.\n\nMa=\r\nny scientists now are agreeing that Quantum theory applies to Biology as we=\r\nll. Recently there was an article in MIT technology review on Quantum entan=\r\nglement keeping DNA strands together. Erwin Schrodinger the father of moder=\r\nn quantum physics was hugely influenced by Vedanta and gave us the Wave equ=\r\nation as a result of that inspiration.\n\nScience is still an imperfect tool =\r\nto measure something as subtle as consciousness but might be getting close.=\r\n..\n\nmy random thoughts.\n\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@yahoogroups.com, Girish Sundaram &lt;gisundar@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaskarams=\r\n Narasimhaji,\n&gt; Inadvertently or by some means there are always some answer=\r\ns to my queries which I may not even have asked in your email threads. \n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; The other day I had a query about which direction should one place=\r\n one&#39;s head while sleeping.

As the gravity in =\r\nthe subtle body plane is also accordingly different in India from the rest =\r\nof the world, Vimalananda said this contributes to spiritual sadhana and pr=\r\nogress being a little easier in India.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can look at the gravity map=\r\n and see that India indeed stands out from the rest of the world!\n&gt; \n&gt; Best=\r\n regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; =\r\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFi=\r\nlms.org\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotis=\r\nh writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ---------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
