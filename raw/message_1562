This seems to be the case for many of us =\r\nor Most of us. We invoke the deity in the Fire and Idol but then the prsenc=\r\ne is forgotten.\n\nWhen I moved, I mentally asked Siva to pardon me. So, I di=\r\nd not have any doubt about Siva presence when I moved it. How ever, if a pe=\r\nrson I respect is sitting in a sofa, I will try to avoid moving the sofa. B=\r\nut, if needed, I will request the guest to stand up and then move the sofa.=\r\n In this case, if I had requested Siva to come to another object and after =\r\nmoving the siva linga, I restored him into Siva lingam, I would not have fe=\r\nlt bad. How ever, I do not quite know if this is appropriate (I know how to=\r\n ask Siva to come to yatha sthanam, but is there any procedure to shift the=\r\n place of the God once he is invoked?\n\n&gt; * Same goes for reusing of Water f=\r\nor Abhisheka. it gives that we didn&#39;t care much for Shiva.\nNo, I won&#39;t agre=\r\ne your view here. I did not care about the act of abhisheka. I was seeing i=\r\nt merely as an act to glue my son to the seat. How ever, my son pour the wa=\r\nter fast and hence I end up get lots and lots of water. I usually drink the=\r\n water after he finishes the abhishekam. If I should not reuse the water, I=\r\n won&#39;t be able to drink up all the water. May be I can use it for bathing t=\r\nhe next day (but then storing the water becomes a regular activity). So, re=\r\nusing the water seem to simplify the whole thing.\n\n&gt; But It is your own goo=\r\nd heart which immediately realised the error and provocated the thought of =\r\ndoubt. it was such a strong feeling that you wrote to the list. that shows =\r\nyour concern about the whole issue.\n&gt; \n&gt; In my opinion, both the points men=\r\ntioned needs to be avoided hence forth. Though i feel Shiva is easy going a=\r\nnd Bhole Baba who is reputed for not taking offense for such trivial issues=\r\n.\n\nThanks for your kind responce.\n\nI treated Siva as a kid (if my son is in=\r\n sofa watching TV, I won&#39;t hesitate to move the sofa - in this case I had m=\r\nentally requested Siva not to mind; but in the end my son started doing it =\r\nhimself, (once the bowl was full, he took the siva lingam out and put it in=\r\n the other container and continued that way. That is what made me think if =\r\nI am misdirecting him.\n\nHow ever, strangely I felt resonating sound while I=\r\n was chanting mRtyunjaya mantra (felt as if there is chanting from with in =\r\nme) and felt very well. So, I am sure Siva was not upset - but that could b=\r\ne because he is Siva.\n\nI will definitely try not to move the idol.\n\n\n"}}
