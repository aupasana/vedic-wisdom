I might be misintrepreting some stuff with my reposting=\r\n , also kindly search for the message in the group.\n\n1.Lord Brahma is the a=\r\nrchitect of the world and the world is nothing but his dream projection.\n\n2=\r\n.Having gotten trapped in this dream projection all beings need to escape t=\r\nhis dream reality to find salvation.\n\nBrahmaji&#39;s function is to create very=\r\n beautiful elaborate worlds....and he is fully capable of granting that to =\r\nhis worshippers. What is the point of gaining power over creating worlds wh=\r\nen the whole goal of sadhana is to move beyond it .\n\nNarasimha ji has also =\r\nmentioned the following previously .Notice the shaktis of the trimurtis.\n\n1=\r\n.Lord Brahma- To create one needs Knowledge and Goddess Saraswati is the fo=\r\nrm of Knowledge and wisdom.\n\n2.Lord Vishnu- To sustain one needs wealth and=\r\n Goddess Lakshmi is the form of all kinds of weath both material and spirit=\r\nual.\n\n3.Lord Shiva- To dissolve one needs energy or shakti and Goddess Parv=\r\nati is the form of Shakti.\n\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n\n--- In vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;aru334la&quot; &lt;rkalyandurg@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Respected mem=\r\nbers, a seven year old asked me &quot;In our Temple we have all the gods but Bra=\r\nhma is not there, why?&quot; \n&gt; Requesting your help on how to answer this quest=\r\nion, I did not want to talk about Brahmaji receiving a curse etc...\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
