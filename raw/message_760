Rao&quot; &lt;pvr=\r\n@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; There is need at all to address me as Ji or =\r\nSir.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Personally, I do not like to do Japa with a Mala, as I feel thi=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; makes the whole process very mechanical and preoccupies my mind with\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; issues such as not crossing the Meru, handling the Mala properly\n&gt; &gt; et=\r\nc..I find my mind dwelling on these issues rather than the mantra\n&gt; &gt; itsel=\r\nf.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mind anyway preoccupies itself with many things! :-) By giving it a=\r\nn\nanchor \n&gt; to focus on (like handling of the maalaa), you are actually\nsta=\r\nbilizing it \n&gt; somewhat. If this specific pre-occupation minimized many oth=\r\ner (and\nworse) \n&gt; pre-occupations, it is not a bad thing at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is=\r\n like a monkey that keeps jumping from one place to another\nplace being \n&gt; =\r\ntied to a pole with a chain to limit its jumping. The monkey may\nstill be \n=\r\n&gt; jumping up and down, but the chain atleast *limits* its movement\naround o=\r\nne \n&gt; pole.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, if the monkey learns to stay in one place witho=\r\nut\njumping, it \n&gt; needs no chain or pole anymore. Chain was there in the fi=\r\nrst place\nto limit \n&gt; its jumping.\n&gt; \n&gt; Each person is the best judge of wh=\r\nere one is and what is\nappropriate for \n&gt; oneself. We make progress by reco=\r\ngnizing our weaknesses and\naddressing them.\n&gt; \n&gt; In addition, there are cer=\r\ntain chakras in the tips of fingers that are \n&gt; directly connected to the b=\r\nrain. Objects like rudraksha and tulasi\nbeads can \n&gt; stimulate those minor =\r\nenergy centers. Thus, there is *some* use in the \n&gt; beginning.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. Do=\r\nes Japa have to be done with a Mala?\n&gt; \n&gt; Upto you. For most people, I reco=\r\nmmend using a maalaa.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. What are the ramifications of crossing the =\r\nMeru bead?\n&gt; \n&gt; What use is it to know? Avoid it as much as you can. If you=\r\n cross\nit, so be \n&gt; it. Don&#39;t worry and move on. But, avoid crossing it aga=\r\nin.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I know some scriptures say Japa done with Mala (in my case Vishn=\r\nu\n&gt; &gt; mantra done with Tulsi Mala) is more effective then japa done without=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Mala.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2. Is this meant to be taken seriously?\n&gt; \n&gt; It is also =\r\ngiven in a scripture that Rudraksha and Tulasi maalaas\ncan be \n&gt; used for c=\r\nhanting any mantra and they are many more times powerful than \n&gt; other maal=\r\naas. My suggestion is to pick up either a Rudraksha maalaa\nor a \n&gt; Tulasi m=\r\naalaa based on your taste and use it for *all* mantras.\n&gt; \n&gt; I want to cate=\r\ngorically state that using a Tulasi maalaa for Shiva or a \n&gt; Rudraksha maal=\r\naa for Vishnu will NOT do you any harm.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3. What should one concentra=\r\nte when reciting Japa for purpose of\n&gt; &gt; remedial measures? The mantra, the=\r\n devata, one&#39;s goals?\n&gt; \n&gt; Anything that works as an anchor to limit the mi=\r\nnd from straying\naway too \n&gt; much is useful. An image or visualization of d=\r\neity may work for some. \n&gt; Focussing on each sound and ups and downs in int=\r\nonation may work for\nsome. \n&gt; The goal is to minimize other thoughts. Think=\r\ning of one&#39;s goals will\nusually \n&gt; make the mind stray away into unnecessar=\r\ny pre-occupations. It is\nbetter to \n&gt; focus on deity or mantra.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best r=\r\negards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/h=\r\nomam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;=\r\n Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish le=\r\nssons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Wi=\r\nndows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website=\r\n: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;sbm_sh=\r\narma&quot; &lt;sbm_sharma@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Saturda=\r\ny, December 13, 2008 11:59 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Mala For Japa?\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is my first post.
