We are all ignorant in some ways or the other=\r\n, but what joins us is our desire to progress.\n\nAdwaita is the final realit=\r\ny. But the problem is that one stuck deeply in duality may not be able to c=\r\nome out it by merely telling oneself &quot;all is Brahman&quot;. If one looks at plea=\r\nsure and pain differently, if one looks at praise and criticism differently=\r\n and if one looks at different objects with a different attitude, it is bec=\r\nause of the conditioning accumulated through many lives. It does not leave =\r\none so easily. One needs some plan to use the tools of duality to overcome =\r\nduality.\n\nOne already in Hawaii may enjoy its beauty directly. But one livi=\r\nng elsewhere may have to take a taxi, a train, a plane and a taxi before on=\r\ne can enjoy its beauty.\n\nSimilarly, depending on how heavy one&#39;s karmas and=\r\n kaarmik debts are, one may need to engage in many actions in the world bef=\r\nore one can become enlightened.\n\nThe same rishis who taught the final truth=\r\n of Adwaita in Upanishads also taught many ways to navigate the currents of=\r\n duality to reach the shore of non-duality.\n\nJust as one rowing a boat but =\r\nnot specifically eyeing the shore may keep rowing in the waters forever, si=\r\nmilarly one engaged in ritual practices without eyeing liberation may keep =\r\ndoing rituals forever. At the same time, just as one looking at the shore i=\r\nntently but not rowing the boat may be stuck in the waters forever, similar=\r\nly an adwaiti eyeing liberation but avoiding rituals or actions may be stuc=\r\nk forever simply desiring liberation and not knowing how to attain it.\n\nThe=\r\n right balance is personal. One needs to engage in actions aimed at cutting=\r\n down one&#39;s karmik debts and keep contemplating the Final Reality.\n\nSeveral=\r\n of us perform a homam (fire ritual) as a spiritual sadhana. Fire ritual is=\r\n found in many ancient religions. Unlike the elements of earth, water and a=\r\nir, fire is ever pure and it purifies whatever it comes in contact with. Th=\r\ne Sanskrit name for fire is paavaka, i.e. purifier. Fire is a living god th=\r\nat everyone has access to. Spending time worshipping god through fire purif=\r\nies one&#39;s subtle consciousness. Vedic seers (rishis) performed homam regula=\r\nrly, for the benefit of the world. Several detailed manuals are available a=\r\nt the website mentioned below.\n\nBTW, I lived in Houston during 1991-1993.
