Shiva and Vishnu had unconditional love and devotion for each other. They are not like normal human beings and their relationships, such as love and devotion, are not governed by petty notions of superiority and dependence.\n \nThe Shaivite-Vaishnavite distinctions and the biases of Kali yuga are unfortunate. Nevertheless, I am willing to tolerate biases and closed-mindedness. Closed-mindedness is ok as long as one is making some progress with one&#39;s own belief system.\n \n*        *        *\n \nOne climbing a mountain has to choose one of the available paths. Whether one acknowledges that several mountain paths lead to the mountain top or whether one believes that only the path one has chosen leads to the top, is not that important. As long as one is climbing the mountain in one&#39;s chosen path, one is doing alright!\n \nAfter all, there may be many paths around the hill. One may be unable to see paths on the other side of the mountain or even distant paths on the same side. If one does not think much of those paths and focuses on climbing in one&#39;s own path, that does no harm.\n \nAs one reaches the top, it gets narrower and one may see the other paths that seemed quite distant earlier to be quite nearby now. As one is very close to the top, one will see that all paths are leading there. When one is on the top, one sees all paths to converge there. After god-realization, one sees various paths to be valid paths to god. Of course, different paths come with different obstacles. One path may have some snow. One path may be too steep. One path may be slippery. One path may have falling rocks. One path may have fallen trees blocking it. And so on. But, one on the top knows that people can reach there using several paths, if they are committed to overcoming the obstacles and reaching the top.\n \nLet people follow the paths chosen by them and wish them good luck to reach the top in their own paths. Let them say whatever they want to say about your path. It does not matter. If YOU have conviction and faith, you just walk your path and reach the top!\n \n*        *        *\n \nThe problem is that some people are doing no sadhana really, making no progress really and yet passing judgments on other paths and getting into fights. They are like people at the base of the mountain, trying to block people from some paths and trying to enroll them in their path. They may fight with people and kill them too. They stay at the base forever and never reach the top. They are a problem.\n \nBut, people with narrow views who do some sadhana and make progress are ok. They are on some path and will eventually reach god. For example, so many Krishna bhaktas who look down upon Shiva as a lower demigod may be doing their mantra several malas a day with a good level of devotion and they will eventually make progress. I know Vaishnavas in some sampradayas who do not even worship Ganesha as he is &quot;from Shiva&#39;s family&quot; and worship Vishvaksena at the start of their poojas instead of Ganesha. But, they do no harm to anyone, try to see all human beings as Vishnu&#39;s forms, try to serve all and keep their austerities. Bottomline is that they are doing some sadhana and will eventually make progress.\n \nLet us not worry about people who are doing some sadhana and progressing. Any deficiencies in their understanding will be addressed in due course.\n \nThe bottomline is: Keep doing enough sadhana to burn the conditioning and keep making progress.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n&gt; I hardly disagree with your views but for Iskcon I have my own thoughts,no doubt on Shri Prabhupada and his mission to spread Shri Krishna&#39;s awareness but many times(After exit of Shri Prabhupada)on numerous occasions I found their views very biased towards Shri Shivji and for that reason I have my reservations and those views of mine are not my own views as some senior ex-Iskconites too share same views like me.If I am allowed to speak I have seen very few shivites speaking hard stuff like them for opposite side.(Shri Hari or Shri Krishna),not even that well known astrologer Sanjay Rath once posted a separate procedures for Vaishnavas to do Mahamrityunjaya japam using Shri Veda Vyasa&#39;s name instead of Shri Vasishtha mantra(Vam Vasishthaya Namah) !

If you see an elephant carefully, your mind may be able to capture all of its details well. If you read thousands of books on an elephant without having ever seen one, you may still not be able imagine an elephant. Moreover, you may find different books to be contradictory. You may like some and dislike some based on your own biases about what an elephant looks like. If you see an elephant yourself oneday, you will realize then that books that seemed contradictory once are not that contradictory after all.\n&gt; \n&gt; Srila Prabhupada was undoubtedly a great saint. To go abroad without even knowing anyone there at an advanced age to spread Krishna bhakti, to roam New York streets without proper shoes or clothing in winter, requires tremendous surrender. Based on previous samskaras, some may not be attracted to his interpretations. But that does not take away anything from them.\n&gt; \n&gt; My personal favorite is Lord Jnaneshwar&#39;s take on Bhagavad Gita and I also like Aadi Shankara&#39;s commentary overall. However, Srila Prabhupada&#39;s commentary is fine too and it is perfect for people with certain samskaras.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sophisticated and complicated Upanishadic ideas are not palatable to everyone. They need to be simplified. Especially, people from monotheistic belief systems and subscription based religions need simpler models of divinity. So Upanishads and scriptures need to be interpreted so as to be palatable to them. So many great saints came and interpreted scriptures slightly differently, because there are different groups of people with different samkaras waiting to be guided by them.\n&gt; \n&gt; My philosophy is simple. Read what appeals to you. Follow what you are able to. But, in the end, reading tomes about elephant are only the starting point. In addition, search actively and try to actually see the elephant oneday.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; ---- Rudra Aksha &lt;aksha.rudra@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; I totally agree with Nithinji on this and once there was a very long discussion on Shri Shiva&#39;s status in their pantha in other forum(s).\n&gt; &gt; Better use a ref.from reliable source like Gita press for this.\n&gt; &gt; pranams to all.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- On Sat, 11/13/10, K K &lt;kk889123@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: K K &lt;kk889123@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: On Astrologers and Priests\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Saturday, November 13, 2010, 7:03 AM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Srila Prabupada&#39;s english translation of Bhagvad Gita at least and Iskon&#39;s interpretations are highly faulty and misleading.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nithin\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- On Fri, 12/11/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: On Astrologers and Priests\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Cc: &quot;Nagraj Kota&quot; &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Date: Friday, 12 November, 2010, 8:27 PM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was referring to Vyasa&#39;a Sanskrit version.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One can access easy English translations by Srila Prabhupada of various scriptures (including Srimad Bhagavatam) at http://vedabase.net.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In Potana&#39;s Telugu version, chapters may be arranged slightly differently.

I have a copy of Telugu Bhagavatam by Bammera Potana and the details are not given there, in my understanding. If you read the telugu version, can you please clarify if those points are covered in telugu also somewhere? The language is quite complex by today&#39;s standards (even in telugu), so I always have this doubt if I am reading it enough and interpreting right?

I will reply to them together.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding mail 1 below on priests:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Doing rituals for one&#39;s own upliftment is one thing and doing it for others is another. In the former, one is cleaning up a dirty place that one is forced to live in. In the latter, one is going to someone else&#39;s dirty place and cleaning it up. If there is some radioactive waste there and one is not protected, one may be affected.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As I keep saying, results of one&#39;s previous karmas are like fruits lying in a basket. One takes out one fruit after another and eats them. Some may be tasty and some may be bitter or rotten. When one does rituals and other spiritual sadhana, the deities throw away some bad fruits into a trash can and make one eat good fruits earlier than otherwise. But there may be some spillage as dirty fruits are thrown away. If a priest is conducting the ritual, he may be affected by the spillage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the old days, priests did intense sadhana and generated enough purity to handle such things. Many priests of today do not do enough penance. They are quite vulnerable as they start messing with other people&#39;s karmas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Secondly, many priests of today who conduct poojas are not really brahmanas. Being born to a brahmana father is neither necessary nor sufficient for one to become a brahmana oneself. One&#39;s aptitude, attitude and actions have to be brahmana-like. Many brahmanas today think of power and influence over others or of money or of comforts. They are not thinking just of knowledge and liberation. They are not really brahmanas. In fact, there are very very few brahmanas on earth right now. Shastras are clear that rituals can be performed for others only by brahmanas. What it means is that one desirous of power, influence, money and comforts is unfit to perform rituals for others.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is there any remedy for this?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, stop doing rituals for others. Or, do enough individual penance when you are not doing rituals for others. Moreover, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahmana by overcoming the tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding mail 2 below on astrologers:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is not an immature comment and there is an element of truth in it. A lot of what I said above applies here too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Every action performed with ego (a sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;) produces an equal reaction. If an astrologer&#39;s action of giving advice to someone resulted in that person doing X instead of Y at kaarmik crossroads and experiencing Z instead of W in coming years, there is clearly an action here. If the astrologer has some sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;, then one is bound to experience the fruits of it. Some blessings can come and some sufferings can come too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Messing with someone else&#39;s karmas is always a risky business.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; What is the solution? Well, become a true brahmana. Again, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahmana by overcoming tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas. Irrespective of where one was born and brought up, one will become a brahmana if one follows this. Only brahmanas are qualified to play with the karmas of others by giving life-altering advice or by conducting rituals. Again, to be clear, I am not talking about brahmanas by birth, but about brahmanas by conduct.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The above will become clear, if you look at the criteria laid about by Parasara, Varahamihira etc on who can be taught Jyotish!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mail 1:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- &quot;aksha.rudra&quot; &lt;aksha.rudra@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are present Brahmanas suffering from any curse(Shapam)?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This I am asking after seeing the overall and general condition of Brahmanas specially those who do pujas for Yajmanas and involved in Karmakanda.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And if this is true is there any remedy for this?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think this is the only place where we can discuss this subject hence I am posting this query here.Thanks a lot in advance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mail 2:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rl_yhoo&quot; &lt;rl_yhoo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimhaji and other educated Scholars,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have just started listening to your (Narasimhaji&#39;s) mp3 training sessions and am very eager to review my own chart. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However in numerous instances in the past, I&#39;ve heard through friends and close uncles that astrology can have a severe adverse impact on yourself (astrologer) and yrou family.
