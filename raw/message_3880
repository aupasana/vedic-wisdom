What is essential for life\n=\r\nand honour should be made available to all the people of the country. It is=\r\n\nfor this we want plans. Men of means should live like the poor and should\n=\r\nnot increase their wants beyond necessities. The rich should share their\npr=\r\nosperity with the poor. This is punya, leading to salvation. The more we\nin=\r\ncrease our wants, to that extent, there will be no peace or comfort and it\n=\r\nwill only produce poverty and sorrow.\n\nVedanta which is the peak of the Ved=\r\nas teaches the way for the removal of\nsorrow. Hatred and desire arise only =\r\nin respect of the objects other than\nus. That desire will not arise if thos=\r\ne objects are rendered identical with\nus, if there is nothing other than us=\r\n, then desire will not arise. If there\nis no desire, there will be no effor=\r\nt and no sin. When there is no sin,\nthere will be no body and there will be=\r\n no misery.\n\nWe may get many types of sorrow. What seems to be sorrow to al=\r\nl the people\nof a place may not seem sorrowful to us. If we stay always hap=\r\npy, without\nwanting to attain anything untouched by sorrow like the lotus-l=\r\neaf and the\nKalakodi - seed, that is called yoga. &quot;Know that to be indicate=\r\nd as yoga\nwhich is separation from being united with sorrow, The removal of=\r\n\nassociation with sorrow.&quot;\n\nIn order to reach one purport, why should the V=\r\neda speak of many matters?\nThis question may arise in our minds. It is thro=\r\nugh many matters that it is\npossible to understand that one purport which i=\r\ns Reality - yoga, meditation,\nausterity, sacrifice, performance of karma; w=\r\nhen these are accomplished,\nwhat they indicate is that one Reality. It is t=\r\nhat Reality which is the true\npurport of the Veda. Other things are of a ch=\r\nanging nature. They become\nwoven into a story and then even that story disa=\r\nppears.\n\nWhat for is the science of medicine? It is for keeping the body st=\r\nrong and\nhealthy. What if the body is not strong and healthy? The body will=\r\n be\nsubject to diseases. What if there is disease? One will not be able to\n=\r\nfunction properly. He who has given this body is the supreme Self. This is\n=\r\nthe truth, we should practice several disciplines. We can practice them onl=\r\ny\nif the body is well. In order to keep it well, we must prevent it from\nbe=\r\ncoming a prey to disease. The science of medicine tells us how to prevent\nd=\r\niseases. Thus, Ayurveda helps in the realisation of Advaita experience.\n\nSa=\r\nvikapla Samadhi: The mind is steady without any distraction, contemplating\n=\r\nits object wholly absorbed therein.\nNirvikalpa Samadhi: This is the goal of=\r\n yoga. In this, the mind ceases to\nfunction and vanishes once and for all, =\r\nleaving the self to shine forth\nalone. In Advaita too, the path of meditati=\r\non is recognised; but here the\nobject of meditation is the distinction-less=\r\n Brahman.\nSahaja Samadhi: This is realised through the path of enquiry. It =\r\nis the\nnatural state of Self - realisation and one of utter unconcern for t=\r\nhe\nfleeting phenomena.\n\nThere is nothing to feel elated about seeing the pe=\r\nople worshipping me. But\nwhen I reflect that is worship to the God, who the=\r\ny think are approachable\nthrough me, I feel glad that there are so many who=\r\n believe in a\ncompassionate God who will hear them and remove their misery.=\r\n\n\nOur religion Hinduism has grown by devotion, meditation and self -\npurifi=\r\ncation. The other religions might have grown by propaganda and\nconflict. Th=\r\ne reason for crores of our people remaining within the fold of\nHinduism, in=\r\n spite of powerful propaganda of other religionists, wars, lure\nof money, e=\r\ntc., is we see a great man (Mahatma) in our midst by whom we are\nimpressed.=\r\n We develop devotion to him and generate faith in our religion.\nThere is a =\r\ntext in the Veda which says that a flowering tree attracts bees\nautomatical=\r\nly. If we examine ourselves and we find one of use to be perfect,\nthe world=\r\n will follow him.\n\nA child eats earth. Its hands are tied by the mother. Th=\r\ne child gets angry\nand cries. Is it without reason the mother ties it&#39;s han=\r\nds? We do not know\nthe mercy of Universal Mother. The good or harm coming t=\r\no us has its source\nin Her Grace; Suffering - Her Grace for some reason. We=\r\n must accept whatever\ncomes to us, good or bad, as Her Grace. We do not kno=\r\nw why she gives it. Our\nvision is limited. We do not know what precedes it =\r\nor follows it. If we are\nable to look into the past present and future, we =\r\nwill know that God does no\nharm to us. Other than God, there is no kith or =\r\nkin for us.\n\nWe cannot say that a child or an idiot who keeps quiet without=\r\n activity like\na stone is great. We cannot presume that he has attained jiv=\r\nanmukti. This is\nthe result of sin. He is a Yogi or Jnani whose intellect i=\r\ns very subtle and\nas sharp as a sword. He has to become like a withered tre=\r\ne, an immovable\nobject with a steady mind. He must understand all that is h=\r\nappening around\nhim. His knowledge should be perfect. He should not be affe=\r\ncted by passion\nor sorrow. He should always be happy. None of us is like th=\r\nat and Iswara is\ndescribed as Sat-Chit-Ananda.\n\nIf God is the ocean of merc=\r\ny and if He knows everything, He must know what\nwe want. Why should we appe=\r\nal to Him to do this or that? The reasonable\nanswer is that instead of begg=\r\ning useless people at useless places, we plead\nbefore the Highest and the O=\r\nmniscient. Otherwise, we have no justification\nto ask Him to give us this o=\r\nr that.\n\nEverything disintegrates on earth and this earth also will vanish =\r\none day.\nThe sun will disappear and the whole universe will go. Then there =\r\nmust be\nsome powerful substratum responsible for creation, protection and\nd=\r\nestruction. We call it God. We have the faculty of thinking and capacity of=\r\n\ndoing, in smaller or greater measure. This also merges after our death wit=\r\nh\nthe omnipotent. Being, from whom we derive this energy. The stable princi=\r\nple\nwhich is the cause of creation and destruction of all energy is God, ca=\r\nlled\nby any name.\n\nMother loves her child but later on, an unfaithful sun c=\r\nauses her sorrow. We\nknow of cases where mother starts litigation against s=\r\nons or sons against\nmother. If one loves another, and if one of them dies, =\r\nthe bereavement\ncauses sorrow. The bank helps people who have deposited mon=\r\ney with them. It\nis supposed to remove the sorrows of the people in times o=\r\nf need. But when\nthe bank itself is liquidated or closed, the depositors we=\r\nep. Their sorrows\nonce gave sustenance to the bank. The more we love, the g=\r\nreater the sorrow\nin consequence. Then, shall we decide that we should not =\r\nlove anyone at all?\nThe object of this birth is to bestow undivided love on=\r\n someone. The subject\nof our love should not be quarrelsome or separable. I=\r\nf we say that we should\nlove only the imperishable God, then the question i=\r\ns: can we hate others?\nLet us learn to love all be realising that God is in=\r\n all. God is eternal and\nour love for him should be eternal.\n\nI am prone to=\r\n come to the conclusion that there lives none without\npredominantly selfish=\r\n motives. But with years rolling on, an impression,\nthat too a superficial =\r\none, true to my nature, is dawning upon me that there\nbreathe on this globe=\r\n some souls firmly rooted in morals and ethics who live\nexclusively for oth=\r\ners, voluntarily forsaking not only their material gains\nand comforts but a=\r\nlso their own sadhana towards their spiritual\nimprovements.\n\nIt is clear to=\r\n us that there is birth and there is death. Passion is the\ncause of birth. =\r\nTime is the cause of death. What is created by passion is\ndestroyed by time=\r\n. If passion comes, the seed sprouts. If time comes, the\ntree dies. Kaalo J=\r\nagat Bhakshaka: Even the sun and the moon disintegrate\nwhen time comes. If =\r\nthere is no passion, there is no production. If there is\nno time then there=\r\n is no destruction. Therefore we have to conquer Kaala and\nKaama. Iswara bu=\r\nrnt Kaama and kicked time. So if we go to Him, there is\nneither birth nor d=\r\neath for us. Let us therefore pay to the Universal Father\nand Mother.\n\n&quot;Jag=\r\natha pitarau Vande Paarvati Parameswarau&quot;\n\nA master has two servants. One a=\r\nlways flatters the master, the other just\nperforms his duties without any l=\r\nove for the master. If the master is a\nfool, he would love the flattering s=\r\nervant. If the master is too clever, he\nwill not love either the man workin=\r\ng for wages or the flatterer. The master\nwill love more the one who does hi=\r\ns job as his own out of devotion. So is\nthe case with the Good Master, God.=\r\n\n\nWhy do we break coconut before Lord Ganesa&#39;s idol? He is the Son of\nParam=\r\neswara and asked His Father to sacrifice His head with three eyes\nbecause o=\r\nnly then, he thought any effort would be crowned with success and\nwithout a=\r\nny obstacle. So, instead of the head with three eyes, we are\nbreaking cocon=\r\nut which has three eyes. Ganesa is so powerful as to demand\nthe head of his=\r\n own father. Whatever is superior to everything else must be\nsacrificed to =\r\nGod. Symbolically, we are sacrificing the three - eyed\ncoconuts created by =\r\nGod, as ordained by Him. When a sannyasin attains\nSiddhi, this is done. Thi=\r\ns practice is in vogue only in Tamil Nadu.\n\nThinking that God is far away f=\r\nrom you, you are wandering in search of Him.\nSo long as you do not know, He=\r\n is far away. Though you may wander, you\ncannot see Him, but he is near you=\r\n. He is distant, yet near. The story of a\ngirl wanting to marry the highest=\r\n among men, a king, ended, after all the\ntravels, in the discovery of an or=\r\ndinary man her parents had already\nselected. The bridegroom was so near. Sh=\r\ne took a long route to arrive at a\npoint so near.\n\nWe see our reflections i=\r\nn a mirror. In a row of mirrors, thousands of\nreflections are seen. It is o=\r\nnly one person who sees all these reflections.\nThe one who resides within u=\r\ns and who sees all this, is God. The seer is the\ncause of all the seen. Tha=\r\nt cause is knowledge which is the basis of this\nworld. Where is that knowle=\r\ndge? Within you, what is macroscopic is\nmicroscopic in you.\n\nJoy comes in t=\r\nhe form of status, money, etc. comes from without. We feel\nisolated. But it=\r\n is the smallest fragment of the great joy from within,\nwhich is Ananda. Pa=\r\nramatman, the ananda within is not worried whether any\njoy comes from outsi=\r\nde and mixes with it or not. Waters enter into the sea,\nwhich though ever b=\r\neing full, is ever motionless.\n\nIf we analyse the teachings of the Gita, th=\r\nere may appear to be many\ncontradictory matters regarding bhakti, karma and=\r\n jnana. But the Lord takes\nthe devotee step by step. We must meditate on th=\r\ne form of God as described\nin the scriptures. This bhakti will enable us to=\r\n understand the universal\nnature of God. Spiritual vision will then make it=\r\n clear that God without\nform is the Supreme Reality, which hears without ea=\r\nrs, moves without legs.\nTo worship God at the initial stage, metaphysical k=\r\nnowledge is not\nnecessary. The more and more we meditate, bhakti grows and =\r\nwe automatically\nrealise the universal form. There is no distinction betwee=\r\nn the devotee and\nthe object of devotion.\n\nOur minds should automatically s=\r\neek and cling to God just as iron filings\nare attracted by the magnet; the =\r\nheart of the chaste wife seeks her husband;\nthe creeper embraces the tree; =\r\nthe rivers go to the sea.\n\nPhilosophical truths and ordinary people have no=\r\nthing much in common.\nTherefore outward garb is useless. The representative=\r\ns of religion must have\nreal worth, peace - loving nature (shantam), auster=\r\nity (tapas) and unselfish\nnature. Hinduism, in spite of its vicissitudes, i=\r\ns surviving even to this\nday. This is due to the blessings of a succession =\r\nof saints. If there is one\nsaint among us, the world will prosper.\n\nIt is n=\r\natural that man should seek to satisfy his wants like hunger, thirst,\nand a=\r\n place to rest. There are duties which an individual has towards\nhimself, t=\r\nhe social group and the nation. Ordinarily, the performance of\nthese duties=\r\n remains on the level of satisfying the creaturely wants. But\nthere is a wa=\r\ny of performing these duties which will elevate everyone\nconcerned spiritua=\r\nlly. That is dharma. And it is the duty of the king or the\nstate to see tha=\r\nt the citizens are provided every opportunity for spiritual\ngrowth and prog=\r\nress. That is the meaning of saying: &quot;Raja Dharmasya\nKaaranam&quot;.\n\nUpaasana i=\r\ns dhyaana or concentration of meditation. A form is required for\nconcentrat=\r\nion. Reality is always the same and changeless. God, as the\nUltimate Realit=\r\ny, is Formless. But Upasana of a Form is done with a purpose,\nnamely, the a=\r\nttainment of a given benefit. The purpose to be attained by\nworshipping or =\r\nconcentrating on a Form differs. The scriptures tell you how\nto meditate an=\r\nd on what all Forms and with what results. For Upasana, you\nhave to follow =\r\nthe Sastras or Scriptures. The different upasanas are all\naids in the path =\r\nto the ultimate goal, namely, understanding Reality.\nScriptures prescribe U=\r\npaasana n order to train the mind to concentrate.\nUpasana is the affair of =\r\nthe individual; there is nothing collective about\nit.\n\nNeither the raw frui=\r\nt nor the tree wants to leave each other. But when the\nfruit becomes ripe, =\r\nthis attachment automatically disappears. Man requires\nto experience anger,=\r\n jealousy, passion, etc. just as the fruit had to\nundergo various stages of=\r\n growth and taste before it became fully ripe so to\nget automatically detac=\r\nhed from the tree. We cannot overcome these\nexperiences in the beginning. B=\r\nut we must ponder over the fact why we\nundergo these experiences. Otherwise=\r\n we will be the losers. We will become\nslaves of these experiences and can =\r\nnever achieve fulfillment or\ncontentment.\n\nWhen adversities overtake us, we=\r\n blame God and complain that He is blind to\nour misfortunes. But if we indu=\r\nlge in a little introspection, we will\nrealise that our faults are so enorm=\r\nous that we are utterly unworthy of His\ngrace and, in spite of that we are =\r\nable to get food, shelter and clothing.\nIt is due to the abundant mercy of =\r\nGod. We must consider the difficulties we\nencounter as a blessing in disgui=\r\nse.\n\nA mother may tie the hands of her child who has the propensity to pick=\r\n up\nand eat mud. This seeming cruelty of the mother is for the good of the\n=\r\nchild. Similarly troubles are verily God&#39;s grace to save us. In the entire\n=\r\npicture of life, troubles form but a tiny spot. In our inability to\nvisuali=\r\nse the past and the future, we complain when we suffer in the\npresent. A pr=\r\noper perspective will enable us to understand our present\nplight in its pro=\r\nper setting.\n\nWhenever any honour is done to a person the recipient must re=\r\nmember the\ndivine source from which he derived the qualifications to receiv=\r\ne that\nhonour, and feel humble and not elated with a feeling of self - impo=\r\nrtance.\n\nCultivate Friendly attitude to conquer the minds of men;\nLook at o=\r\nthers as yourself;\nGive up war; give up jealousy;\nDon&#39;t commit aggression w=\r\nithout reason;\nMother earth is like Kamadhenu to fulfil wishes;\nThe Lord Go=\r\nd is like father showering mercy\nPeople of the World !\nLive with discipline=\r\n;\nLive with charity;\nLive with mercy;\nMay all people attain greater well - =\r\nbeing\n\nSource: http://www.kamakoti.org/miscl/divine50b.html\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=\r\n=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=\r\n=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd112d849591a0480f5195e\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;By multiplying wants, we only increase poverty.

This question may arise in our=\r\n minds. It is through many matters that it is possible to understand that o=\r\nne purport which is Reality - yoga, meditation, austerity, sacrifice, perfo=\r\nrmance of karma; when these are accomplished, what they indicate is that on=\r\ne Reality. It is that Reality which is the true purport of the Veda. Other =\r\nthings are of a changing nature. They become woven into a story and then ev=\r\nen that story disappears.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What for is the scienc=\r\ne of medicine? It is for keeping the body strong and healthy. What if the b=\r\nody is not strong and healthy? The body will be subject to diseases. What i=\r\nf there is disease? One will not be able to function properly. He who has g=\r\niven this body is the supreme Self. This is the truth, we should practice s=\r\neveral disciplines. We can practice them only if the body is well. In order=\r\n to keep it well, we must prevent it from becoming a prey to disease. The s=\r\ncience of medicine tells us how to prevent diseases. Thus, Ayurveda helps i=\r\nn the realisation of Advaita experience.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Savikap=\r\nla Samadhi: The mind is steady without any distraction, contemplating its o=\r\nbject wholly absorbed therein.=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Nirvikalpa Samadhi: This is =\r\nthe goal of yoga.

The other religions might have grown by propaganda and conf=\r\nlict. The reason for crores of our people remaining within the fold of Hind=\r\nuism, in spite of powerful propaganda of other religionists, wars, lure of =\r\nmoney, etc., is we see a great man (Mahatma) in our midst by whom we are im=\r\npressed.

We do not know why she gives it. Our vision is lim=\r\nited. We do not know what precedes it or follows it. If we are able to look=\r\n into the past present and future, we will know that God does no harm to us=\r\n. Other than God, there is no kith or kin for us.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;We cannot say that a child or an idiot who keeps quiet without activity l=\r\nike a stone is great. We cannot presume that he has attained jivanmukti. Th=\r\nis is the result of sin. He is a Yogi or Jnani whose intellect is very subt=\r\nle and as sharp as a sword. He has to become like a withered tree, an immov=\r\nable object with a steady mind. He must understand all that is happening ar=\r\nound him. His knowledge should be perfect. He should not be affected by pas=\r\nsion or sorrow. He should always be happy. None of us is like that and Iswa=\r\nra is described as Sat-Chit-Ananda.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If God is th=\r\ne ocean of mercy and if He knows everything, He must know what we want. Why=\r\n should we appeal to Him to do this or that? The reasonable answer is that =\r\ninstead of begging useless people at useless places, we plead before the Hi=\r\nghest and the Omniscient. Otherwise, we have no justification to ask Him to=\r\n give us this or that.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Everything disintegrates =\r\non earth and this earth also will vanish one day. The sun will disappear an=\r\nd the whole universe will go. Then there must be some powerful substratum r=\r\nesponsible for creation, protection and destruction. We call it God. We hav=\r\ne the faculty of thinking and capacity of doing, in smaller or greater meas=\r\nure. This also merges after our death with the omnipotent. Being, from whom=\r\n we derive this energy. The stable principle which is the cause of creation=\r\n and destruction of all energy is God, called by any name.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mother loves her child but later on, an unfaithful sun causes he=\r\nr sorrow. We know of cases where mother starts litigation against sons or s=\r\nons against mother. If one loves another, and if one of them dies, the bere=\r\navement causes sorrow. The bank helps people who have deposited money with =\r\nthem. It is supposed to remove the sorrows of the people in times of need. =\r\nBut when the bank itself is liquidated or closed, the depositors weep. Thei=\r\nr sorrows once gave sustenance to the bank. The more we love, the greater t=\r\nhe sorrow in consequence. Then, shall we decide that we should not love any=\r\none at all? The object of this birth is to bestow undivided love on someone=\r\n. The subject of our love should not be quarrelsome or separable. If we say=\r\n that we should love only the imperishable God, then the question is: can w=\r\ne hate others? Let us learn to love all be realising that God is in all. Go=\r\nd is eternal and our love for him should be eternal.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;I am prone to come to the conclusion that there lives none without pre=\r\ndominantly selfish motives. But with years rolling on, an impression, that =\r\ntoo a superficial one, true to my nature, is dawning upon me that there bre=\r\nathe on this globe some souls firmly rooted in morals and ethics who live e=\r\nxclusively for others, voluntarily forsaking not only their material gains =\r\nand comforts but also their own sadhana towards their spiritual improvement=\r\ns.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It is clear to us that there is birth and the=\r\nre is death. Passion is the cause of birth. Time is the cause of death. Wha=\r\nt is created by passion is destroyed by time. If passion comes, the seed sp=\r\nrouts. If time comes, the tree dies. Kaalo Jagat Bhakshaka: Even the sun an=\r\nd the moon disintegrate when time comes. If there is no passion, there is n=\r\no production. If there is no time then there is no destruction. Therefore w=\r\ne have to conquer Kaala and Kaama. Iswara burnt Kaama and kicked time. So i=\r\nf we go to Him, there is neither birth nor death for us. Let us therefore p=\r\nay to the Universal Father and Mother.=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&qu=\r\not;Jagatha pitarau Vande Paarvati Parameswarau&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;A master has two servants. One always flatters the master, the other jus=\r\nt performs his duties without any love for the master. If the master is a f=\r\nool, he would love the flattering servant. If the master is too clever, he =\r\nwill not love either the man working for wages or the flatterer. The master=\r\n will love more the one who does his job as his own out of devotion. So is =\r\nthe case with the Good Master, God.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Why do we br=\r\neak coconut before Lord Ganesa&#39;s idol? He is the Son of Parameswara and=\r\n asked His Father to sacrifice His head with three eyes because only then, =\r\nhe thought any effort would be crowned with success and without any obstacl=\r\ne. So, instead of the head with three eyes, we are breaking coconut which h=\r\nas three eyes. Ganesa is so powerful as to demand the head of his own fathe=\r\nr. Whatever is superior to everything else must be sacrificed to God. Symbo=\r\nlically, we are sacrificing the three - eyed coconuts created by God, as or=\r\ndained by Him. When a sannyasin attains Siddhi, this is done. This practice=\r\n is in vogue only in Tamil Nadu.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thinking that G=\r\nod is far away from you, you are wandering in search of Him. So long as you=\r\n do not know, He is far away. Though you may wander, you cannot see Him, bu=\r\nt he is near you. He is distant, yet near. The story of a girl wanting to m=\r\narry the highest among men, a king, ended, after all the travels, in the di=\r\nscovery of an ordinary man her parents had already selected. The bridegroom=\r\n was so near. She took a long route to arrive at a point so near.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We see our reflections in a mirror. In a row of mirrors, =\r\nthousands of reflections are seen. It is only one person who sees all these=\r\n reflections. The one who resides within us and who sees all this, is God. =\r\nThe seer is the cause of all the seen. That cause is knowledge which is the=\r\n basis of this world. Where is that knowledge? Within you, what is macrosco=\r\npic is microscopic in you.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Joy comes in the form=\r\n of status, money, etc. comes from without. We feel isolated. But it is the=\r\n smallest fragment of the great joy from within, which is Ananda. Paramatma=\r\nn, the ananda within is not worried whether any joy comes from outside and =\r\nmixes with it or not. Waters enter into the sea, which though ever being fu=\r\nll, is ever motionless.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If we analyse the teachi=\r\nngs of the Gita, there may appear to be many contradictory matters regardin=\r\ng bhakti, karma and jnana. But the Lord takes the devotee step by step. We =\r\nmust meditate on the form of God as described in the scriptures. This bhakt=\r\ni will enable us to understand the universal nature of God. Spiritual visio=\r\nn will then make it clear that God without form is the Supreme Reality, whi=\r\nch hears without ears, moves without legs. To worship God at the initial st=\r\nage, metaphysical knowledge is not necessary. The more and more we meditate=\r\n, bhakti grows and we automatically realise the universal form. There is no=\r\n distinction between the devotee and the object of devotion.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our minds should automatically seek and cling to God just as i=\r\nron filings are attracted by the magnet; the heart of the chaste wife seeks=\r\n her husband; the creeper embraces the tree; the rivers go to the sea.&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Philosophical truths and ordinary people have nothin=\r\ng much in common. Therefore outward garb is useless. The representatives of=\r\n religion must have real worth, peace - loving nature (shantam), austerity =\r\n(tapas) and unselfish nature. Hinduism, in spite of its vicissitudes, is su=\r\nrviving even to this day. This is due to the blessings of a succession of s=\r\naints. If there is one saint among us, the world will prosper.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It is natural that man should seek to satisfy his wants like=\r\n hunger, thirst, and a place to rest. There are duties which an individual =\r\nhas towards himself, the social group and the nation. Ordinarily, the perfo=\r\nrmance of these duties remains on the level of satisfying the creaturely wa=\r\nnts. But there is a way of performing these duties which will elevate every=\r\none concerned spiritually. That is dharma. And it is the duty of the king o=\r\nr the state to see that the citizens are provided every opportunity for spi=\r\nritual growth and progress. That is the meaning of saying: &quot;Raja Dharm=\r\nasya Kaaranam&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Upaasana is dhyaana or conc=\r\nentration of meditation. A form is required for concentration. Reality is a=\r\nlways the same and changeless. God, as the Ultimate Reality, is Formless. B=\r\nut Upasana of a Form is done with a purpose, namely, the attainment of a gi=\r\nven benefit. The purpose to be attained by worshipping or concentrating on =\r\na Form differs. The scriptures tell you how to meditate and on what all For=\r\nms and with what results. For Upasana, you have to follow the Sastras or Sc=\r\nriptures. The different upasanas are all aids in the path to the ultimate g=\r\noal, namely, understanding Reality. Scriptures prescribe Upaasana n order t=\r\no train the mind to concentrate. Upasana is the affair of the individual; t=\r\nhere is nothing collective about it.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Neither the=\r\n raw fruit nor the tree wants to leave each other. But when the fruit becom=\r\nes ripe, this attachment automatically disappears. Man requires to experien=\r\nce anger, jealousy, passion, etc. just as the fruit had to undergo various =\r\nstages of growth and taste before it became fully ripe so to get automatica=\r\nlly detached from the tree. We cannot overcome these experiences in the beg=\r\ninning. But we must ponder over the fact why we undergo these experiences. =\r\nOtherwise we will be the losers. We will become slaves of these experiences=\r\n and can never achieve fulfillment or contentment.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;When adversities overtake us, we blame God and complain that He is blind=\r\n to our misfortunes. But if we indulge in a little introspection, we will r=\r\nealise that our faults are so enormous that we are utterly unworthy of His =\r\ngrace and, in spite of that we are able to get food, shelter and clothing. =\r\nIt is due to the abundant mercy of God. We must consider the difficulties w=\r\ne encounter as a blessing in disguise.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A mother =\r\nmay tie the hands of her child who has the propensity to pick up and eat mu=\r\nd. This seeming cruelty of the mother is for the good of the child. Similar=\r\nly troubles are verily God&#39;s grace to save us. In the entire picture of=\r\n life, troubles form but a tiny spot. In our inability to visualise the pas=\r\nt and the future, we complain when we suffer in the present. A proper persp=\r\nective will enable us to understand our present plight in its proper settin=\r\ng.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Whenever any honour is done to a person the r=\r\necipient must remember the divine source from which he derived the qualific=\r\nations to receive that honour, and feel humble and not elated with a feelin=\r\ng of self - importance.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cultivate Friendly attit=\r\nude to conquer the minds of men;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Look at others as yourself=\r\n;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Give up war; give up jealousy;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Don&#39;t =\r\ncommit aggression without reason;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\nMother earth is like Ka=\r\nmadhenu to fulfil wishes;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Lord God is like father showe=\r\nring mercy=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;People of the World !=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Live with =\r\ndiscipline;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Live with charity;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Live with me=\r\nrcy;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;May all people attain greater well - being&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;=\r\nhttp://www.kamakoti.org/miscl/divine50b.html&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.=\r\nkamakoti.org/miscl/divine50b.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=\r\n=82 =C2=A0=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B =C2=A0=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=\r\n=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF =C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D =C2=A0=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=\r\n=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81 =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd112d849591a0480f5195e--\r\n\n"}}
