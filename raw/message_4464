She later became an ardent follower of J. Krishnamurti and\nreturned to In=\r\ndia in 1935 to teach at the Krishnamurti School near Benares.\nBy 1942 she b=\r\necame despondent and left the school in search of a means to\nassuage the in=\r\nner crisis that had engulfed her. This brought her to the\nMaharshi from who=\r\nm she sought clarity, peace and direction. From the\nexcerpts of her diary b=\r\nelow it is apparent that during her six-week stay in\nTiruvannamalai she was=\r\n granted that, and more.\n\nThe diaries of Atmananda were edited by Ram Alexa=\r\nnder and published by\nIndica Books under the title &quot;Death Must Die&quot;. The bo=\r\nok contains the\nintimate story of a sincere seeker who ultimately finds her=\r\n way to peace and\nsecurity under the loving guidance of Anandamayi Ma. Atma=\r\nnanda died in\nBenares in 1985 and at her funeral was given the utmost honor=\r\n and respect\naccorded a sanyasini of the highest order.\n\nRamanashram, Tiruv=\r\nannamalai, 17 May 1942\n\nI left Benares on the 10th May. As the train approa=\r\nched Tiruvannamalai, I\nsuddenly felt blissfully happy, thinking, &#39;Now all s=\r\ntruggle is over, there\nwill be only peace. The prodigal son has returned to=\r\n his father&#39;s house.&#39;\nAfter some time this passed.\n\n31 May, 1942 - Question=\r\ns for Ramana:\n\n(1) If the mind seems utterly confused and muddled, what is =\r\nthe first step\nin order to get clear?\n\n(2) In one of the books of your dial=\r\nogues you say that such thoughts as &quot;Is\nthis a good thing to do or is that&quot;=\r\n should not be allowed. How can one live\nand decide without such considerat=\r\nions?\n\n(3) At times I am completely at peace and at other times all restles=\r\nsness.\nThere seems no connection at all between these two conditions. Why i=\r\ns that?\n\n3 June, 1942\n\nAnswer to question No.2: &quot;If you surrender to the Su=\r\npreme Will, there will\nbe no question of decision or choice.&quot;\n\nQuestion: Bu=\r\nt I don&#39;t know the Supreme Will. I do not know to whom to\nsurrender. How do=\r\n I know the Supreme? I may deceive myself.\n\nAnswer: It is the mind that dec=\r\neives itself. At least you must admit that\nyou exist. Either you accept the=\r\n Supreme or at least enquire into the true\nnature of your self. Who are you=\r\n? Knowing or not knowing belongs to the mind\nand therefore all your so call=\r\ned &#39;knowledge&#39; is really ignorance. You\nidentify yourself with the mind and=\r\n that is the cause of the confusion. Enquire\nmore deeply into the true natu=\r\nre of your individuality (i.e., Who is it that\npossesses a mind?). In fact,=\r\n if you perceive that the mind does not exist at\nall, then it will vanish a=\r\nlong with the confusion, and what truly is will\nstand revealed. When you lo=\r\nok at your reflection in the water and believe it\nto be an accurate represe=\r\nntation of yourself, then you are troubled when the\nmovement of the water d=\r\nisturbs the reflection. But when you realize that\nthis has no reality to it=\r\n, then your worries cease. You cannot get rid of\nyour shadow, but you need =\r\nnot believe that it is who you really are.\n\nQuestion: I feel as if I were t=\r\nwo and not one.\n\nAnswer: No, there is only the Self, there cannot be two. B=\r\nut if you focus\nonly on the form of the bangle, you may forget that it is m=\r\nade of gold. Yet\nthe form of the bangle is dependent on the gold. It cannot=\r\n exist without it\nand ceases to exist when the gold is melted down; but the=\r\n gold itself\nremains constant. By deluding yourself into identifying solely=\r\n with the\nmind, you deny your true Self. This is worse than suicide, becaus=\r\ne in\nsuicide you only kill the body; but here you are murdering the Self. S=\r\neek\nthe Self and the ego will vanish.\n\nBy solving one mind-created problem =\r\nyou only create new ones. When you cut\noff one leaf, four new ones sprout o=\r\nut. Only by killing the root of the\ntree, can you prevent the leaves from g=\r\nrowing.\n\n17 June 1942\n\nQuestion: When I asked you how to solve the problems=\r\n of life, you said &quot;Self\nsurrender.&quot; How can one surrender without danger u=\r\nntil Self realization has\nbeen achieved, as the mind may create its own God=\r\n to surrender to? The most\ncruel things in the world are done in the name o=\r\nf God.\n\nMaharshi: The mind and all of its creations come from the same sour=\r\nce.\nSelf-enquiry and Self-surrender are the same. As you proceed in Self-en=\r\nquiry\nyou automatically surrender (as you become nearer to the Divine Sourc=\r\ne).The\nperson that surrenders to a mind-created God will have to bear the\nc=\r\nonsequences of his actions and suffer for them. But even the thought of\nGod=\r\n, however false, will take you to the Supreme Truth of the Self\nultimately.=\r\n The man who has realized, knows that the thought of a separate\nGod is utte=\r\nrly false. But until then one cannot help it. When you are\ntotally still, y=\r\nou are the Self. When we think, we are forgetting God.\nSelf-enquiry leads b=\r\nack to Him (who is none other than the Self).\n\nQuestion: Ultimately, but it=\r\n may take a long time!\n\nMaharshi: There is no time. You may have it even no=\r\nw.\n\nSomeone else&#39;s question: If the Self is one, why is it necessary to app=\r\nroach\na Guru?\n\nMaharshi: In reality it is not necessary, but because we are=\r\n dreaming on the\nphysical plane, the presence of the realized man is necess=\r\nary to wake us up\n- to remind us of ourselves. When the proud elephant drea=\r\nms that a lion\ncomes, he gets a shock and wakes up suddenly. As we are all =\r\ndreaming, the\nhelp of the Guru, within this dream, is necessary in order to=\r\n force us to\nwake up. The eyes of the Guru disperse the dream.\n\nQuestion: T=\r\nhe physical eyes?\n\nMaharshi: There are only &#39;eyes&#39;, not physical or otherwi=\r\nse.\n\nMiss Merston&#39;s question: From where does the &#39;resolve&#39; come to start t=\r\nhe\nSelf-enquiry?\n\nMaharshi: From the mind, like all other thoughts. But by =\r\nhaving only one\nsingle thought, this thought finally also gets absorbed. Yo=\r\nu need not follow\nyour thoughts; the more you think the more thoughts there=\r\n will be. But\nrather take each thought back to its source. That is surrende=\r\nr and enquiry\nat the same time.\n\nQuestioner: Why are you unable to refuse w=\r\nhen others prevail on you for this\nor that? Are you not free of karma and t=\r\nherefore able to do as you like?\n\nMaharshi: There are three types of karma:=\r\n\n(1) Made by one&#39;s own actions and desires.\n(2) Inevitable karma like Gover=\r\nnment - world circumstances beyond your\npersonal control.\n(3) The karma of =\r\nothers taken on himself by the man who is free of his own\nkarma.\nQuestioner=\r\n: Is it like Christ, who suffers for the sins of others?\n\nMaharshi: Yes. Th=\r\nere is no freedom, it [freedom] is merely a word (i.e.,\neven Christ or the =\r\nrealised saint still must fulfill his destiny outwardly,\nalthough inwardly =\r\nhe is fully liberated).\n\nQuestioner: Yesterday my old agony of restlessness=\r\n returned, and with it my\nfear. I had back ache, head ache and tummy ache a=\r\nnd utter misery. This in\nturn made me resentful at feeling somewhat bound. =\r\nBut this morning I\nsuddenly got back my peace after deciding to talk to Bha=\r\ngavan and to ask him\nwhy I can&#39;t get rid of my egotistical resistance. As I=\r\n asked him the\nquestion tears came. The answer was: &quot;Take the resistance in=\r\nto your heart\nand keep it there.&quot;\n\nFrom the Ashtavakra Gita: &quot;When the mind=\r\n is freed from such pairs of\nopposites as &#39;this is done&#39; and &#39;this is not d=\r\none&#39; it becomes indifferent to\nreligious merit, worldly prosperity, desire =\r\nfor sensual enjoyment and for\nliberation.\n\n&quot;The one who abhors sense object=\r\ns avoids them, and one who covets them\nbecomes attached to them. But he who=\r\n does not accept or reject, is neither\nunattached nor attached.\n\n&quot;He who ha=\r\ns an egoistic feeling even towards liberation and considers even\nthe body a=\r\ns his own is neither an jnani nor a yogi. He only suffers misery.&quot;\n\nSource:=\r\n http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/2003/?pg=3Dmay-jun\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=\r\n=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=\r\n=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=\r\n=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=\r\n=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=\r\n=81\n\r\n--000e0cd6e78cef28870488f84405\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nAtmananda was a young, accomplished Austrian musician whose inte=\r\nrest in Theosophy first took her on a visit to India in 1925 at the age of =\r\ntwenty-one.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;She later became an arden=\r\nt follower of J.

He only suffers misery.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.aru=\r\nnachala.org/newsletters/2003/?pg=3Dmay-jun&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.ar=\r\nunachala.org/newsletters/2003/?pg=3Dmay-jun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:both;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:87%;m=\r\nargin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-he=\r\night:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82 =C2=A0=E0=B0=A8=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B =C2=A0=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =C2=A0=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF =C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D =C2=A0=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=\r\n=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=\r\n=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81 =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd6e78cef28870488f84405--\r\n\n"}}
