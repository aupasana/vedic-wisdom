I was also\n&gt; &gt; finalizing my new book which deals specificall=\r\ny with Tamil Nadu religious\n&gt; &gt; politics, and in particular with the role o=\r\nf various nexuses based overseas.\n&gt; &gt; So I decided to jump into the eye of =\r\nthe storm of this scandal in order to\n&gt; &gt; investigate whether similar nexus=\r\nes were at work in this case. Naturally, at\n&gt; &gt; one level I have seen this =\r\nscandal through the framework of a civilization\n&gt; &gt; encounter in which Vedi=\r\nc culture is pitted against the Dravidian\n&gt; &gt; divisiveness that is being ba=\r\ncked by Christian evangelism. At another level,\n&gt; &gt; I found that the sensat=\r\nionalized media reports were too one-sided, and none\n&gt; &gt; of them had a sing=\r\nle statement to report from the swami himself.\n&gt; &gt; Furthermore, there was c=\r\nhaos and mismanagement of the crisis from Swami\n&gt; &gt; Nithyananda&#39;s inner cir=\r\ncle. In hindsight, things might have turned out\n&gt; &gt; differently had they ma=\r\nnaged more sensibly and faster =96 which I will\n&gt; &gt; elaborate later in this=\r\n article. Given this, another interest of mine has\n&gt; &gt; been to extrapolate =\r\nimportant lessons from this episode for other Hindu\n&gt; &gt; organizations, whic=\r\nh I predict will face similar scandals as and when their\n&gt; &gt; weaknesses bec=\r\nome understood by those opposed to them. This article\n&gt; &gt; highlights my fin=\r\ndings at these multiple levels and issues.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; During this 2-week inve=\r\nstigative period, I have been loyal to my pledge to\n&gt; &gt; give Swami Nithyana=\r\nnda&#39;s organization the benefit of doubt and to report\n&gt; &gt; their side of the=\r\n story. Besides wanting to balance out the one-sided media\n&gt; &gt; depictions, =\r\nI wanted access to the ashram&#39;s core group for my own research\n&gt; &gt; on the b=\r\nroader subject of civilization encounters. I respect the\n&gt; &gt; sensitivities =\r\nof that organization consisting of many decent and dedicated\n&gt; &gt; devotees w=\r\nho have sacrificed a great deal and stand to lose a lot.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But I hav=\r\ne concluded that the situation is now beyond repair for Swami\n&gt; &gt; Nithyanan=\r\nda and that his continued involvement can only damage the broader\n&gt; &gt; inter=\r\nests of dharma as well as jeopardize the ashramites. Along with two\n&gt; &gt; oth=\r\ner sympathizers who are not ashramites, I have personally recommended to\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Swami Nithyananda that the best course at this stage would be for him to\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; resign completely from his organization. He should turn it over to a sm=\r\nall\n&gt; &gt; team of senior Hindu mahatmas, so that the assets can be used in th=\r\ne best\n&gt; &gt; interests of dharma. Further, under the guidance of these mahatm=\r\nas he must\n&gt; &gt; live a quiet life as a sadhu devoid of any institutional res=\r\nponsibilities.\n&gt; &gt; Because the head of any organization must accept respons=\r\nibility that &quot;the\n&gt; &gt; buck stops here,&quot; only such a move can salvage the or=\r\nganization and the\n&gt; &gt; reputation of dharma at large. Over several years, t=\r\nhis resignation would\n&gt; &gt; hopefully reduce the massive pressure that has bu=\r\nilt up against him\n&gt; &gt; personally, and enable him to live peacefully as a s=\r\nadhu. It is up to him to\n&gt; &gt; accept or reject this advice. The basis for th=\r\nis conclusion becomes clearer\n&gt; &gt; once the reader has gone through the rest=\r\n of this article.\n&gt; &gt; I want to begin by examining some principles about th=\r\ne relationships between\n&gt; &gt; siddhis (extraordinary yogic powers), morality,=\r\n Tantra and sex. This will\n&gt; &gt; provide the framework in which to interpret =\r\nwhat has happened. Then I will\n&gt; &gt; turn to my initial interest in pursuing =\r\nthe challenges facing Hinduism in\n&gt; &gt; south India from a variety of forces.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Siddhis (Extraordinary Yogic Powers) and Morality\n&gt; &gt; A few =\r\ndays ago, I had the honor of having a two-hour private conversation\n&gt; &gt; wit=\r\nh Sri Sri Ravi Shankar at his ashram in Rishikesh. I introduced myself as\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; an independent researcher who is writing a series of books on Indian\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n civilization in the context of the global challenges and opportunities. On=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; of my volumes will be specifically on the major global gurus since th=\r\ne 1960s\n&gt; &gt; =96 including Krishnamurti, Swami Muktananda, Maharishi Mahesh =\r\nYogi,\n&gt; &gt; Pabhupada, among others - as well as living global gurus such as =\r\nSri Sri\n&gt; &gt; himself. I have been investigating what happened to such gurus,=\r\n in terms of\n&gt; &gt; the shifts in their Western followers over time, their sca=\r\nndals, their\n&gt; &gt; Indian followers and critics, and also how each guru negot=\r\niated his/her\n&gt; &gt; position sandwiched between Indian orthodoxy on one side =\r\nand Western\n&gt; &gt; modernity on the other. The relevance of this in the contex=\r\nt of Swami\n&gt; &gt; Nithyananda will become clear very soon.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The first =\r\nprovocative question I asked Sri Sri concerned the nature of yogic\n&gt; &gt; powe=\r\nrs: What is the relationship between siddhis and morality? If siddhis\n&gt; &gt; a=\r\nre a scientific phenomena dealing with powers that can be harnessed by all\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; humans then one must bear in mind that science deals with truths that a=\r\nre\n&gt; &gt; morally neutral. If Einstein was declared to have lived an immoral l=\r\nife it\n&gt; &gt; would not invalidate his scientific theories. A person who desig=\r\nns aircrafts\n&gt; &gt; or any other complex technological systems may or may not =\r\nbe moral in order\n&gt; &gt; to be effective in his technical work. In other words=\r\n, rtam (the patterns of\n&gt; &gt; the cosmos), which we discover and call science=\r\n, functions independently of\n&gt; &gt; human morality. This is why a scientific p=\r\nrinciple can be used either\n&gt; &gt; morally or immorally, because it is indepen=\r\ndent of morality. There are moral\n&gt; &gt; persons who lack any siddhis or even =\r\nordinary scientific competence.\n&gt; &gt; Conversely, there are great siddhas (li=\r\nke Ravana) who lack morality. Sri\n&gt; &gt; Sri&#39;s pranayama techniques would also=\r\n produce results for an immoral person.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sri Sri seemed impres=\r\nsed by this question, and agreed with my overall\n&gt; &gt; position on the indepe=\r\nndence between siddhis and morality. But he pointed\n&gt; &gt; out that the moral =\r\ndimension, while not determining the siddhis, was also\n&gt; &gt; important becaus=\r\ne it led to receiving the grace of the divine. I agree with\n&gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; So there are two separate phenomena involved: (i) spiritual technologies=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; that are objective and that allow anyone to harness spiritual energies=\r\n, and\n&gt; &gt; (ii) morality which is important in itself, not for attaining sid=\r\ndhis, but\n&gt; &gt; in order to have a positive relationship with the divine. Eit=\r\nher one can be\n&gt; &gt; developed without the other; however, the dharma traditi=\r\non encourages us to\n&gt; &gt; cultivate both. The reason that meditation systems =\r\nprescribe things like\n&gt; &gt; vegetarian diet, ahimsa, etc. is because an inapp=\r\nropriate lifestyle\n&gt; &gt; interferes with the mental tranquility required to a=\r\ndvance. This lifestyle\n&gt; &gt; change can be appreciated regardless of whether =\r\none believes in a personal\n&gt; &gt; God or not. This absence of a personal God i=\r\ns clear in Buddhist meditation.\n&gt; &gt; Different Hindu systems place different=\r\n levels of emphasis upon a personal\n&gt; &gt; God for the yoga to function. This =\r\nis why many secular and scientifically\n&gt; &gt; minded persons are also drawn to=\r\nwards meditation techniques. In other words,\n&gt; &gt; something cannot be a scie=\r\nnce if it depends upon morality, because science\n&gt; &gt; is objective and stand=\r\ns independent of morality.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The relevance of this question is as fo=\r\nllows: Many persons who have learned\n&gt; &gt; advanced meditation from Swami Nit=\r\nhyananda want to know if any moral\n&gt; &gt; breaches by him would invalidate the=\r\n whole Hindu claim of achieving higher\n&gt; &gt; states of consciousness. When a =\r\nfar worse sex scandal against the legendary\n&gt; &gt; Swami Muktananda emerged in=\r\n the 1990s, involving charges by a large number\n&gt; &gt; of his Western female d=\r\nisciples, the Western academy rashly condemned not\n&gt; &gt; only one man&#39;s moral=\r\nity, but also the whole legitimacy of the Indian\n&gt; &gt; tradition itself. In t=\r\nhat series of debates (with RISA scholars like Sarah\n&gt; &gt; Caldwell, etc.), I=\r\n took the same position then as I am taking now: that\n&gt; &gt; Muktananda&#39;s capa=\r\nbilities in harnessing spiritual energies are separate and\n&gt; &gt; independent =\r\nfrom whether or not he violated any code of morality.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Patanjali wa=\r\nrns against getting lured by siddhis which appear along the way\n&gt; &gt; when on=\r\ne practices advanced meditation persistently. One is not supposed to\n&gt; &gt; in=\r\ndulge in them. This warning is found in various Hindu systems that deal\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n with the body as a vehicle for spiritual evolution, because these energies=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; are very powerful and can get out of control. Another point that is wo=\r\nrth\n&gt; &gt; noting is that the techniques taught by Swami Nithyananda are not h=\r\nis\n&gt; &gt; original ones; he has made it clear repeatedly that they are from th=\r\ne Shiva\n&gt; &gt; Sutras which have a long history in our civilization. I feel th=\r\nat he does\n&gt; &gt; have the siddhi of being able to transmit these techniques v=\r\nery effectively\n&gt; &gt; to others. For instance, I have never before in my life=\r\n been able to sit\n&gt; &gt; still and alert in meditation for the whole night, bu=\r\nt he had a few hundred\n&gt; &gt; persons in a large hall achieving this. The poin=\r\nt here is similar to saying\n&gt; &gt; that the mathematics and golf I have learne=\r\nd from someone is not invalidated\n&gt; &gt; when the teacher is found to be immor=\r\nal.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hence, the issue of his morality must be pursued separately an=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; independently from whether his siddhis are genuine.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Is Tantr=\r\na a Part of Hinduism?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The second question that I asked Sri Sri cou=\r\nld not be completely dealt with\n&gt; &gt; in the time available for our meeting. =\r\nI hope to pursue this some day with\n&gt; &gt; him and with various other acharyas=\r\n for my own benefit. Its significance in\n&gt; &gt; the present scandal becomes cl=\r\near soon. I asked whether the Shiva Sutras are\n&gt; &gt; valid, pointing out that=\r\n among the 112 spiritual enlightenment techniques\n&gt; &gt; taught in them, about=\r\n 6 deal with sexual contact between a male yogi and a\n&gt; &gt; female yogini. Ka=\r\nshmir Shaivism as well as the Tantra traditions have\n&gt; &gt; included exemplars=\r\n that practiced these techniques. Recently, Osho tried to\n&gt; &gt; revive them a=\r\nnd nowadays Deepak Chopra has brought some elements of these\n&gt; &gt; into his r=\r\nepertoire. Sunthar Visuvalingam, a US based scholar of Tantra and\n&gt; &gt; Kashm=\r\nir Shaivism, is one of the voices who brings out the authenticity of\n&gt; &gt; th=\r\nese approaches in the tradition, despite the common rejections by society\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; at large. The tradition considers itself not suitable for mainstream soc=\r\niety\n&gt; &gt; and is meant only for a small subset of people.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Many popu=\r\nlar Hindu rituals and symbols have emerged out of the Tantra\n&gt; &gt; traditions=\r\n =96 such as Shiva lingam, etc. The Tantra and Vedic traditions were\n&gt; &gt; no=\r\nt separate until recent times. The Vedic-Tantric integration is found in\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Adi Shankara all the way to Jiva Goswami (the great integrator of\n&gt; &gt; Vai=\r\nshnavism who took Ramanuja&#39;s ideas further), and even more recently in\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthe life of Sri Ramakrishna. The Bihar School of Yoga has Tantra\n&gt; &gt; practi=\r\ntioners, but they do it privately and not publicly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have an unpu=\r\nblished monograph that shows the history of this shift in\n&gt; &gt; Indian consci=\r\nousness concerning Tantra. It was under British rule that\n&gt; &gt; certain India=\r\nn leaders (such as Ram Mohan Roy) started to condemn (as part\n&gt; &gt; of their =\r\n&quot;reform&quot; of Hinduism) those aspects of Hinduism that bothered\n&gt; &gt; puritan C=\r\nhristian values. It must be noted that Christianity has had a very\n&gt; &gt; nega=\r\ntive posture towards the human body starting with the Biblical episode\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nof Origin Sin. This is why female priests (called &quot;witches&quot;) got demonized\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; by the Church in its very official genocide of several million practiti=\r\noners\n&gt; &gt; across Europe. This Church prosecution was called the Inquisition=\r\n and was\n&gt; &gt; widespread for a few centuries. The use of shakti and anything=\r\n concerning\n&gt; &gt; the body as a spiritual resource was considered not only im=\r\nmoral but also\n&gt; &gt; demonic, and was outlawed with draconian enforcement. Th=\r\ne term &quot;occult&quot; was\n&gt; &gt; used to refer to a vast assortment of such practice=\r\ns and was heavily\n&gt; &gt; condemned by the Church as the work of the Devil.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n This mentality entered India under the British. The Criminal Tribes Act of=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; India was passed by the British in the late 1800s. It listed several d=\r\nozen\n&gt; &gt; tribes that practiced such &quot;evil&quot; techniques, and they were offici=\r\nally\n&gt; &gt; persecuted into extinction. A middle-class &quot;whitened&quot; Hinduism evo=\r\nlved as\n&gt; &gt; the mark of being &quot;civilized&quot; on British terms. We could thus b=\r\ne proud of\n&gt; &gt; our identity, now that it was &quot;cleansed&quot; of &quot;primitive&quot; prac=\r\ntices of our\n&gt; &gt; ancestors.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In this history of removing Tantra out=\r\n of Hinduism, some people include\n&gt; &gt; Swami Vivekananda among those who und=\r\nermined Tantra. I disagree with this\n&gt; &gt; charge. He was saying a separate s=\r\net of things to his Western audiences than\n&gt; &gt; to Indians. In his Western l=\r\necture tours, he presented a Hinduism that\n&gt; &gt; Westerners could relate to a=\r\nnd appreciate, but he did not ask Indians to\n&gt; &gt; shift their practice. It i=\r\ns unfortunate that after his death, the\n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Mission he started =\r\nhas diluted itself into a sort of\n&gt; &gt; pseudo-Christianity. Kali and other r=\r\nelated Tantra deities, symbols and\n&gt; &gt; rituals that were dear to Ramakrishn=\r\na himself, have become &quot;hidden&quot; for the\n&gt; &gt; &quot;private&quot; use by the monks, but=\r\n are marginalized publicly and considered as\n&gt; &gt; an embarrassment. Their le=\r\nad in this direction has spread across modern\n&gt; &gt; Hinduism to such an exten=\r\nt that Vedic Hinduism has become separated from\n&gt; &gt; Tantra, and Tantra is n=\r\now widely condemned by many Hindu gurus. This is also\n&gt; &gt; a factor that wor=\r\nked against Swami Nithyananda&#39;s reputation among orthodox\n&gt; &gt; Hindu leaders=\r\n, for he uses Tantric techniques that arouse body energies,\n&gt; &gt; such as kun=\r\ndalini.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My own feeling is that Tantra is making a big comeback. Fi=\r\nrst there was\n&gt; &gt; Western popularity of distorted versions of Tantra; but t=\r\nhis is now being\n&gt; &gt; followed by more clinical experimentation by psycholog=\r\nists and others. The\n&gt; &gt; whole issue of latent human energies and potential=\r\ns (both positive and\n&gt; &gt; dangerous) is a hot topic of serious scientific in=\r\nvestigation. Hindus should\n&gt; &gt; reclaim this aspect of their own tradition r=\r\nather than waiting for U-Turned\n&gt; &gt; (appropriated) versions to get re-expor=\r\nted back to India, packaged as &quot;Made\n&gt; &gt; in USA&quot; spiritual science. This re=\r\nquires an attitude of experimentation\n&gt; &gt; under the appropriate controls to=\r\n prevent abuses and quackery.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I just returned from Kumbh Mela wher=\r\ne I walked amidst several tens of\n&gt; &gt; thousands of naga sadhus who were com=\r\npletely naked. I did not consider them\n&gt; &gt; as either vulgar or primitive. T=\r\nhe old guard of Hindu orthodoxy rejects\n&gt; &gt; Tantra at least in public, and =\r\nyet lives in contradictions because they do\n&gt; &gt; respect the naga sadhus and=\r\n also the various symbols and rituals that have\n&gt; &gt; their foundations in Ta=\r\nntra. The vacuum left by avoiding the subject of\n&gt; &gt; Tantra has created opp=\r\nortunities for the likes of Wendy Doniger to formulate\n&gt; &gt; distorted interp=\r\nretations. I feel that Hindu spiritual practitioners as well\n&gt; &gt; as intelle=\r\nctuals must take back control over Tantra as an intrinsic part of\n&gt; &gt; our t=\r\nradition.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sex and Morality\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Against this backdrop, I will =\r\naddress the issue of Swami Nithyananda&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; morality. Just to recap:\n&gt; &gt; M=\r\ny first point above has been that the morality issue about Swami\n&gt; &gt; Nithya=\r\nnanda does not impact the effectiveness of the meditation techniques\n&gt; &gt; he=\r\n has taught very successfully. Their efficacy is best evaluated by the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ntens of thousands of practitioners for themselves.\n&gt; &gt; My second point was =\r\nthat there is nothing inherent about sex that is\n&gt; &gt; rejected by Hinduism a=\r\ncross the board, although certain strains of Hinduism\n&gt; &gt; do reject sex see=\r\ning it as harmful to spirituality.\n&gt; &gt; Here it must be noted that brahmacha=\r\nrya (involving sexual abstinence) is\n&gt; &gt; just one of the spiritual paths of=\r\n Hinduism. The first half of my recent\n&gt; &gt; stay in Haridwar was as a guest =\r\nof the Gayatri Pariwar, one of the greatest\n&gt; &gt; and largest Hindu movements=\r\n, that does not advocate being brahmachari. Its\n&gt; &gt; founder, its present he=\r\nad and its members at large, are householders and not\n&gt; &gt; brahmacharis. But=\r\n for Swami Nithyananda to claim moral authenticity under\n&gt; &gt; this system, h=\r\ne would have to pronounce himself as a householder and not a\n&gt; &gt; sannyasin.=\r\n He has never done that, so we must examine his morality by some\n&gt; &gt; other =\r\ncriteria.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Another approach for him could have been to announce him=\r\nself as an\n&gt; &gt; experimenter of Tantra for modern times, thereby making hims=\r\nelf transparent\n&gt; &gt; of any such charges. This would place him in the same c=\r\nategory as Osho. Many\n&gt; &gt; times in his public discourses and teachings, he =\r\nhas praised Osho as his\n&gt; &gt; greatest teacher and enlightened exemplar. He e=\r\nven said that many of his own\n&gt; &gt; teachings were derived from Osho. But he =\r\nfailed to publicly clarify whether\n&gt; &gt; he was practicing those techniques t=\r\nhat involve sex. Privately, he explained\n&gt; &gt; to me in recent days that Shiv=\r\na Sutras have two categories of techniques.\n&gt; &gt; Most of the sutras do not i=\r\nnvolve physical contact with another person and\n&gt; &gt; only use the four sense=\r\ns of sight, sound, taste and smell as pathways to\n&gt; &gt; spiritual experiences=\r\n. Hence an individual practices these techniques\n&gt; &gt; entirely on his/her ow=\r\nn. This path is what he has taught thus far to the\n&gt; &gt; public. The best pur=\r\nsuit of this path is as a brahamachari according to him,\n&gt; &gt; and he has ini=\r\ntiated many followers into it. But for a small number of\n&gt; &gt; persons, he fe=\r\nels that the 6 sutras involving sexual Tantra need to be\n&gt; &gt; tested and per=\r\nfected for modern times, before they can be safely taught more\n&gt; &gt; widely. =\r\nThis he considers to be like any R & D done in a lab for developing\n&gt; &gt; a p=\r\nroduct.\n&gt; &gt; My sense is that he did practice Tantra with a very small numbe=\r\nr of persons,\n&gt; &gt; and I believe that he even entered into written legal con=\r\ntracts with them to\n&gt; &gt; make sure that both parties were clear about the ar=\r\nrangement. The reason for\n&gt; &gt; this &quot;Non-Disclosure Agreement&quot; was to make s=\r\nure that someone who willingly\n&gt; &gt; approaches him for Tantra does not later=\r\n accuse him of inappropriate\n&gt; &gt; physical contact. On March 9 (about a week=\r\n ago), I did a specific video\n&gt; &gt; interview with him dealing with this issu=\r\ne very specifically. But this video\n&gt; &gt; was blocked by his ashram leaders e=\r\nven though he personally felt that it was\n&gt; &gt; a good idea to show it. I gav=\r\ne up arguing in favor of showing it, because\n&gt; &gt; his ashram management took=\r\n a firm stand against it. I still feel that this\n&gt; &gt; was a blunder they mad=\r\ne. Swami Nithyananda is very forthright and clear in\n&gt; &gt; that interview =96=\r\n I felt that it was the best interview of all the ones I did\n&gt; &gt; with him, =\r\nbut it was never made public.\n&gt; &gt; I surmise that Ranjitha, the Tamil actres=\r\ns in the scandalous videotape, was\n&gt; &gt; practicing Tantra with him. He taugh=\r\nt her the self-control she had to\n&gt; &gt; achieve before any intimacy. I have t=\r\nried to interview her in order to get\n&gt; &gt; her side of the story, but so far=\r\n I have not succeeded in getting through to\n&gt; &gt; her. Based on third party r=\r\neports from some persons who are in touch with\n&gt; &gt; her, and the media repor=\r\nts of her statements, her stance seems to be along\n&gt; &gt; the following lines:=\r\n She took the sexual initiative with him on the occasion\n&gt; &gt; shown in the v=\r\nideotape, at a time when he was not fully alert. But this\n&gt; &gt; activity did =\r\nnot proceed to intercourse. It was terminated. She has also\n&gt; &gt; said that t=\r\nhe videos being shown on TV are manipulated versions of what\n&gt; &gt; actually h=\r\nappened, because they exaggerate the situation. They do not show\n&gt; &gt; portio=\r\nns where he asked her to stop. Different clips from various videos\n&gt; &gt; seem=\r\n to have been turned into a single video by editing. She has not filed\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nany complaint against him. So in the worst case, this was consensual sex\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; between adults, and that too backed by a formal written contract between =\r\nthe\n&gt; &gt; parties. Because she has refused to give any statement against Swam=\r\ni\n&gt; &gt; Nithyananda, she feels threatened by those who set her up and who did=\r\n this\n&gt; &gt; sting operation. I hear that she has gone overseas to protect her=\r\n safety\n&gt; &gt; from this mafia-like conspiracy. I have not been able to corrob=\r\norate this\n&gt; &gt; thesis directly from her.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My concern about his mora=\r\nlity is, therefore, not based on sex between\n&gt; &gt; consenting adults. Rather,=\r\n my moral issue is about the lack of transparency\n&gt; &gt; before the public. He=\r\n could have openly said that he wants to select a few\n&gt; &gt; yoginis to experi=\r\nment Tantra under mutual consent. At worst this would have\n&gt; &gt; upset many f=\r\nollowers and pushed them away. In response to my concern over\n&gt; &gt; his lack =\r\nof transparency, he could offer the argument that this was a\n&gt; &gt; private ac=\r\ntivity between adults who are under no obligation to disclose it\n&gt; &gt; to the=\r\n public. After all, people do not go about broadcasting their sexual\n&gt; &gt; li=\r\nves. So long as this was under mutual consent, he might say, it cannot be\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; an offense. And if it was done under the Tantra portions of the Shiva Su=\r\ntra,\n&gt; &gt; it was also an act within the Hindu tradition despite the controve=\r\nrsy\n&gt; &gt; surrounding Tantra today.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Having given this best case argu=\r\nment on his behalf, I must say that there\n&gt; &gt; could also be the alternative=\r\n scenario, namely, that this was mere lust\n&gt; &gt; packaged as Tantric spiritua=\r\nlity. David White, one of Wendy&#39;s Children, has\n&gt; &gt; written extensively mak=\r\ning the claim that all Tantra is &quot;hard core porn&quot;\n&gt; &gt; that gets wrapped up =\r\nbefore the public in metaphysical mumbo-jumbo to appear\n&gt; &gt; to be legitimat=\r\ne spirituality, which he calls &quot;soft porn&quot; coating. White&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; latest book=\r\n takes this allegation to the extreme, and states that all major\n&gt; &gt; yogic =\r\nexemplars in Indian history were basically not engaged in any kind of\n&gt; &gt; s=\r\npirituality at all. Instead, he claims, they were developing personal power=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; for the purpose of exploiting others. I am unqualified to comment on w=\r\nhether\n&gt; &gt; Swami Nithyananda&#39;s case fits this notion of &quot;soft porn,&quot; or whe=\r\nther it was\n&gt; &gt; legitimate Tantra. Nor do I have adequate factual data of w=\r\nhat happened to\n&gt; &gt; pass judgment either way.\n&gt; &gt; This concludes what I hav=\r\ne to say about his morality issue as shown in the\n&gt; &gt; sex tapes.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; M=\r\ny Impressions of Swami Nithyananda Prior to this Scandal\n&gt; &gt; I was introduc=\r\ned to Swami Nithyananda a couple of years ago, by a prominent\n&gt; &gt; Hindu lea=\r\nder based in California. This man was so impressed by the young\n&gt; &gt; swami t=\r\nhat he frequently called me to speak about him in glowing terms. I\n&gt; &gt; told=\r\n him that I had a guru already, and that my present interest in\n&gt; &gt; interac=\r\nting with gurus was mainly as a part of my research for my book on\n&gt; &gt; glob=\r\nal gurus. He arranged a private meeting for me with Swami Nithyananda,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nwhich I used mostly to explain the civilization threats facing Hinduism,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; citing numerous examples, and questioned him on his position in this rega=\r\nrd.\n&gt; &gt; I found him to be very sharp, a great listener, and in agreement th=\r\nat we\n&gt; &gt; must engage social issues rather than pursuing the &quot;world negatin=\r\ng&quot; or\n&gt; &gt; &quot;escapist&quot; paths that are typical of many gurus today.\n&gt; &gt; Later =\r\non, I attended a weekend course in USA where he taught the Patanjali\n&gt; &gt; Yo=\r\nga Sutras. I have read several translations of this great classical work,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; but I had never before seen it taught experientially. Swami Nithyananda =\r\ngave\n&gt; &gt; the attendees their own personal inner experience of every one of =\r\nthe eight\n&gt; &gt; limbs of Patanjali&#39;s system, right up to and including samadh=\r\ni. This was\n&gt; &gt; quite an achievement in two days.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Overall, my inte=\r\nractions with him remained centered largely on the\n&gt; &gt; geopolitics of relig=\r\nions. I saw him as a prominent swami who was not running\n&gt; &gt; away from trou=\r\nbling issues, such as Christian conversions and the\n&gt; &gt; Dravidianization of=\r\n Tamil identity. Given that I have been writing a book\n&gt; &gt; for three years =\r\n(now in the editing stage) on this very issue as it exists\n&gt; &gt; in Tamil Nad=\r\nu, I was especially impressed by his experimental program of a\n&gt; &gt; Hindu te=\r\nmple on wheels traveling from village to village. In each village\n&gt; &gt; this =\r\nmobile temple stops and offers chanting, a talk by one of the leaders,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nfood, medicines, etc. So it combines religion with social service and thus\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; competes directly against Christian evangelism. Rather than building a\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; temple in every village and needing a purohit in each of the thousands =\r\nof\n&gt; &gt; villages across Tamil Nadu, the strategy was to bring to each villag=\r\ne this\n&gt; &gt; &quot;temple on wheels.&quot; What I discovered by my own independent fact=\r\n-finding was\n&gt; &gt; that wherever this temple on wheels went, the missionaries=\r\n were upset\n&gt; &gt; because it blunted their conversion efforts.\n&gt; &gt; I attended=\r\n his 21-day meditation program in December 2009. The various\n&gt; &gt; techniques=\r\n in it are very deep and transformative. The best evaluation of\n&gt; &gt; this ca=\r\nn be done by the hundreds of attendees, who were divided roughly\n&gt; &gt; equall=\r\ny between Indians and whites from North America.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In several side c=\r\nonversations with him as well in the public forum, I\n&gt; &gt; pursued the point =\r\nthat I already have a guru since 1994, so I was not\n&gt; &gt; looking for a new g=\r\nuru. Since my guru had left the body a few years ago, I\n&gt; &gt; wanted to conti=\r\nnue learning new techniques for my practice. I explained to\n&gt; &gt; him that I =\r\nhad previously learned and practiced meditation techniques from\n&gt; &gt; multipl=\r\ne sources for over 30 years, including: Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Sri\n&gt; &gt; Sri =\r\nRavi Shankar, Yogi Amrit Desai (who certified me as a teacher), Deepak\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nChopra, Vipassana, and more. Additionally, I had practiced numerous bhakti\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; traditions, as well as formal Vedanta education from Swami Chinmayanand=\r\na and\n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Mission. I went through a serious study of the writin=\r\ngs by Sri\n&gt; &gt; Aurobindo, various Madhyamika Buddhist systems, Kashmir Shaiv=\r\nism, Ramana\n&gt; &gt; Maharshi, etc. So I was not seeking a new guru like most ot=\r\nhers who took his\n&gt; &gt; courses.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have to say that he never pressur=\r\ned me to adopt him as my new guru, and\n&gt; &gt; even said that one must remain l=\r\noyal to one&#39;s guru. To be classified as a\n&gt; &gt; devotee/disciple of his, ther=\r\ne are two criteria, neither of which applies to\n&gt; &gt; me. First, there is an =\r\noptional program one can sign up for, to do &quot;paada\n&gt; &gt; puja&quot; at the guru&#39;s =\r\nfeet, in order to develop a special link with him. The\n&gt; &gt; second is that o=\r\nne can ask to be given an initiation with a new name, in\n&gt; &gt; which case his=\r\n policy is that the person must legally change his/her name,\n&gt; &gt; and use th=\r\nis new name publicly. I did not do either of these steps. So my\n&gt; &gt; relatio=\r\nnship is not as a devotee or disciple, but more arms-length.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It wa=\r\ns a two-way street. While he taught me meditation, I brought to him my\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nscholarship on the geopolitical positioning of Hinduism which I feel the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; gurus know only superficially. They do not adequately know things like:\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Western philosophy, neither of the religious nor the secular variety; or=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Western history; or Western institutions that have been set up explici=\r\ntly to\n&gt; &gt; spread its civilization; or various global campaigns under way t=\r\no invade\n&gt; &gt; Indian civilization through conversions, education, media, pol=\r\nitical\n&gt; &gt; policymaking and more.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He requested that I should prese=\r\nnt him my findings on such matters so that\n&gt; &gt; he and his senior acharyas c=\r\nould learn. I told him that most gurus have\n&gt; &gt; little time to listen atten=\r\ntively to a layperson like me, because the gurus\n&gt; &gt; like to do all the tal=\r\nking. He replied that he would sit and listen to me\n&gt; &gt; seriously. I made i=\r\nt clear that I was disinterested in giving a short talk\n&gt; &gt; of a few minute=\r\ns, because my findings required considerable time to be\n&gt; &gt; examined seriou=\r\nsly. I told him that I would need two full days of undivided\n&gt; &gt; attention,=\r\n so that I could present 300 Powerpoint slides.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Swami Nithyananda =\r\nsent me an invitation when I was in Delhi to visit his\n&gt; &gt; ashram and prese=\r\nnt my research. I was delighted to have such an important\n&gt; &gt; audience. I w=\r\nas very impressed by the fact that he sat through two long days\n&gt; &gt; of my t=\r\nalks, about 12 hours per day. He asked his 40 top acharyas and\n&gt; &gt; various =\r\nthought leaders in his ashram to sit and listen to me for both the\n&gt; &gt; days=\r\n. The interactions were intense, and I explained many points from my\n&gt; &gt; fo=\r\nrthcoming books. I felt that he and I had a peer relationship, each side\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; being an expert in his domain to teach the other. After my two days of ta=\r\nlks\n&gt; &gt; were over, he asked me to help him incorporate my core ideas into h=\r\nis\n&gt; &gt; curriculum, so as to make sure that his teachings helped position th=\r\ne Vedic\n&gt; &gt; civilization properly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; No other guru in the world has =\r\ninvested so much time with me to try and\n&gt; &gt; learn these global issues so d=\r\neeply. (The only other prominent guru I know\n&gt; &gt; personally who understands=\r\n these issues about the external challenges is\n&gt; &gt; Swami Dayananda Saraswat=\r\ni.) Most gurus tend to either be dismissive by\n&gt; &gt; resorting to spiritual l=\r\noftiness, or imagine that they already know whatever\n&gt; &gt; there is worth kno=\r\nwing. Thus, my primary interest in Swami Nithyananda was\n&gt; &gt; as a vehicle t=\r\no spread greater awareness of the kinds of issues that I was\n&gt; &gt; researchin=\r\ng. (For instance, he bought a couple of hundred copies of the\n&gt; &gt; book, &quot;In=\r\nvading the Sacred&quot; at the full price, and made it required reading\n&gt; &gt; for =\r\nall his ashram residents.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I must balance this praise with critici=\r\nsm. In my 2-day talks, I had\n&gt; &gt; explicitly discussed that many gurus were =\r\nfalling prey to sex scandals,\n&gt; &gt; often with women planted as part of sting=\r\n operations, or women in the inner\n&gt; &gt; circle who got too close and let thi=\r\nngs get out of control. Despite these\n&gt; &gt; warnings, it seems that nothing c=\r\noncrete was done to prevent or at least\n&gt; &gt; anticipate the crisis that was =\r\nto follow.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My Approach to this Investigation\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When the sca=\r\nndal broke out I was in Delhi. I called the Bangalore ashram\n&gt; &gt; management=\r\n and found them confident but confused. Probably they felt that\n&gt; &gt; the mat=\r\nter would soon get forgotten if left alone. But exactly the opposite\n&gt; &gt; ha=\r\nppened, as each day brought fresh allegations and sensational media\n&gt; &gt; cov=\r\nerage. After several days had passed I was invited to go to Bangalore to\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; study the situation for myself. At that time I had no clue about his Tant=\r\nra\n&gt; &gt; practice with any women. Whatever I knew was based on what his follo=\r\nwers\n&gt; &gt; told me, because he was personally inaccessible for several days e=\r\nven after\n&gt; &gt; I reached Bangalore. I spent many hours daily with some of hi=\r\ns ashram&#39;s top\n&gt; &gt; team.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What I wrote earlier in this article actu=\r\nally comes later in the chronology\n&gt; &gt; of my investigation. But I presented=\r\n it up front because most readers are\n&gt; &gt; obsessed with getting my answer t=\r\no only one single question: did he or did\n&gt; &gt; he not have sex? Nothing else=\r\n seems to matter to them, whereas my\n&gt; &gt; investigation&#39;s emphasis has been =\r\nabout issues broader and more\n&gt; &gt; consequential than any one man&#39;s morality=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Until I concluded my fact-finding 2-week period recently, I was =\r\nunable to\n&gt; &gt; discuss the sexual acts shown in the videotapes. I had to res=\r\npect the\n&gt; &gt; policies of his people as part of the trust being placed in me=\r\n to gain\n&gt; &gt; access. They also needed legal clearance on what can and canno=\r\nt be said by\n&gt; &gt; them. Their policy on the sex tapes was that Swami Nithyan=\r\nanda would\n&gt; &gt; directly explain his acts. The Tamil actress&#39; lawyer was als=\r\no in contact\n&gt; &gt; with them and her sensitivities had to be respected. The s=\r\nensitivities of\n&gt; &gt; the 140-strong ashramites had to be protected also. Giv=\r\nen this set of\n&gt; &gt; circumstances facing me, I feel that it was unfair to de=\r\nmand that I should\n&gt; &gt; hound him with the one critical question. People hav=\r\ne assumed that it was up\n&gt; &gt; to me to decide what would be within the scope=\r\n of each interview. As I have\n&gt; &gt; mentioned earlier, even after certain int=\r\nerviews were recorded by me, the\n&gt; &gt; ashram leadership used its discretion =\r\nnot to air them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In response to my critics on how I conducted my i=\r\nnterviews, I would also\n&gt; &gt; like to explain why I chose to focus on the cri=\r\nminal charges being made\n&gt; &gt; against Swami Nithyananda. Besides the sex-tap=\r\ne being off limits as\n&gt; &gt; mentioned in the foregoing paragraph, the crimina=\r\nl charges became my focus\n&gt; &gt; for two reasons. These charges could be ascer=\r\ntained with objectivity =96 such\n&gt; &gt; as asking for documents on the land ow=\r\nnership, the medical reports on the\n&gt; &gt; death of one meditation participant=\r\n 2 years ago, and so forth. The evidence\n&gt; &gt; was more clear-cut than the ev=\r\nidence on what exactly happened in the\n&gt; &gt; videotapes between two persons n=\r\none of whom were willing to talk with me\n&gt; &gt; about it. Secondly, the conseq=\r\nuences of criminality would be far more severe\n&gt; &gt; than mere moral fallibil=\r\nity. While immoral conduct is a big concern for the\n&gt; &gt; devotees, it is not=\r\n enough grounds by itself for the state to confiscate the\n&gt; &gt; entire proper=\r\nty that runs into very large sums of money. Also, as a matter\n&gt; &gt; of princi=\r\nple, regardless of whether or not he is guilty of the morality\n&gt; &gt; charge, =\r\nI felt opposed to spurious criminal charges being piled up by the\n&gt; &gt; irres=\r\nponsible media just to create sensationalism.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Conspiracy again=\r\nst Swami Nithyananda\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Since I had arrived at the scene while writin=\r\ng my book on the conspiracy in\n&gt; &gt; Tamil Nadu religious politics, it was na=\r\ntural to start with that as my\n&gt; &gt; emphasis for the investigation. But in t=\r\nhis short article I have decided to\n&gt; &gt; focus on the matters surrounding hi=\r\ns conduct and his organization&#39;s conduct,\n&gt; &gt; because these have assumed a =\r\nmore urgent nature. The details of the\n&gt; &gt; conspiracy belong in my book as =\r\ncorroborating evidence for my thesis there.\n&gt; &gt; The types of parties report=\r\ned to be behind the conspiracy, both foreign and\n&gt; &gt; India based, were rema=\r\nrkably similar to the ones I have written about in the\n&gt; &gt; book. So for now=\r\n I shall merely summarize some of the main points concerning\n&gt; &gt; this consp=\r\niracy.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; First one must understand why Swami Nithyananda became such=\r\n a target. He was\n&gt; &gt; virtually unknown 7 years ago, but once he appeared i=\r\nn public his popularity\n&gt; &gt; catapulted at a dramatic rate. For example, las=\r\nt year, YouTube wrote to him\n&gt; &gt; that he was the most watched of all Indian=\r\n spiritual leaders on the Internet\n&gt; &gt; and proposed a closer collaboration =\r\nfor their viewers. This letter also\n&gt; &gt; stated that among all spiritual lea=\r\nders worldwide (not just Indian) he was\n&gt; &gt; the second most popular one, th=\r\ne Vatican being first. His meditation\n&gt; &gt; programs have become very popular=\r\n in USA and in certain Indian states. The\n&gt; &gt; main factors are that partici=\r\npants almost invariably report experiencing\n&gt; &gt; higher states of consciousn=\r\ness, and he has healed a large number of persons\n&gt; &gt; of a variety of diseas=\r\nes. His healing powers are what brought together his\n&gt; &gt; core inner group o=\r\nf devotees from around the world =96 doctors, businessmen,\n&gt; &gt; IT professio=\r\nnals, corporate executives. Many of them have explained their\n&gt; &gt; personal =\r\nhealings from terminal illnesses as the turning point in their\n&gt; &gt; lives. H=\r\nis meditation programs sometimes bring up to a few thousand\n&gt; &gt; attendees f=\r\nor periods ranging from a few days to several weeks.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; While the fun=\r\nds come mostly from upper strata participants in India and USA,\n&gt; &gt; a large=\r\n portion of the expenses have been allocated to develop grass-roots\n&gt; &gt; soc=\r\nial and spiritual programs focusing primarily in Tamil Nadu, his native\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n state. This is where he is seen as a threat by Dravidian as well as\n&gt; &gt; Ch=\r\nristian forces. For instance, in December 2009, about 600 villages across\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Tamil Nadu sent their local &quot;Nithyananda leaders&quot; for a celebration and\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; planning session in his main ashram near Bangalore. I happened to be pr=\r\nesent\n&gt; &gt; for the event. These common folks, mostly from the lower strata o=\r\nf Tamil\n&gt; &gt; society, had walked 300 kilometers for this journey, which they=\r\n saw as a\n&gt; &gt; spiritual pilgrimage. The reason for the anger of Christian a=\r\nnd Dravidian\n&gt; &gt; forces is that his activities have put a dampener to conve=\r\nrsions in many\n&gt; &gt; districts, and several Christians have returned to Hindu=\r\nism by getting\n&gt; &gt; initiated formally into his organization. The swami hims=\r\nelf has spoken\n&gt; &gt; against conversions, and has also stated that the Dravid=\r\nian movement had\n&gt; &gt; made Tamil people unspiritual in their lives, and that=\r\n this had caused\n&gt; &gt; social decay. His Tamil language publications and cour=\r\nses have become his\n&gt; &gt; most popular ones, far exceeding the numbers in Eng=\r\nlish. Also he is a very\n&gt; &gt; big threat because he is not a Brahmin. Because=\r\n he cannot be targeted using\n&gt; &gt; the classic attack strategies used on Brah=\r\nmins, and because the masses in\n&gt; &gt; Tamil Nadu were rising to swell his ran=\r\nks, the threat he posed to the\n&gt; &gt; existing political power structure had t=\r\no be stopped one way or another.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The attack against Swami Nithyana=\r\nnda has consisted of two prongs, destroying\n&gt; &gt; his image and alleging lega=\r\nl misdeeds. At first a highly sensational sexual\n&gt; &gt; charge was broadcast i=\r\nn order to devastate his credibility and create an\n&gt; &gt; atmosphere in which =\r\nany and all kinds of outlandish allegations would be\n&gt; &gt; taken at face valu=\r\ne. Once the media and popular sentiments had been turned\n&gt; &gt; against him, t=\r\nhere was one amazing allegation after another in rapid\n&gt; &gt; sequence. It was=\r\n clear that none of this was spontaneous but was being\n&gt; &gt; centrally orches=\r\ntrated under a systematic plan.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What became evident to me was that=\r\n there was &quot;cooperation&quot; in informal and\n&gt; &gt; unofficial ways among the medi=\r\na, police and lower level judiciary. In fact,\n&gt; &gt; many third parties were a=\r\nware of the attack in advance and had warned his\n&gt; &gt; people before it happe=\r\nned with specific details of the plan. For instance,\n&gt; &gt; one of his top dev=\r\notees got a phone call from someone based in New York\n&gt; &gt; describing the me=\r\ndia and police attack that was to come. His predictions\n&gt; &gt; turned out to b=\r\ne accurate but at that time the ashramites did not take the\n&gt; &gt; threat lite=\r\nrally. He said that for the right sum of money he could be\n&gt; &gt; helpful in p=\r\nreventing such an attack. He claimed that the planning for this\n&gt; &gt; attack =\r\nhad started a year ago. He mentioned that a budget of Rs 200 crores\n&gt; &gt; was=\r\n allocated by some overseas groups to demolish Hindu gurus especially in\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; south India, and named two south Indian churches as the nodal agencies to=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; coordinate this strategic plan. (I am presently pursuing these leads a=\r\ns part\n&gt; &gt; of my book investigation.)\n&gt; &gt; There was another concrete extort=\r\nion effort about eleven or twelve days\n&gt; &gt; prior to the scandal breaking ou=\r\nt. A lawyer contacted them and claimed that\n&gt; &gt; his client had compromising=\r\n videos, and that the client was seeking money or\n&gt; &gt; else they would get r=\r\neleased. The same intermediary later sent a letter\n&gt; &gt; containing a variety=\r\n of unsubstantiated criminal allegations against Swami\n&gt; &gt; Nithyananda, and=\r\n this letter&#39;s distribution list included India&#39;s Prime\n&gt; &gt; Minister, Presi=\r\ndent, Sonya Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, various Chief Ministers\n&gt; &gt; and police=\r\n heads, various national criminal investigation and security\n&gt; &gt; organizati=\r\nons. I have a copy of this letter, and it makes the Nithyananda\n&gt; &gt; organiz=\r\nation seem like a terrorist outfit that needs to be attacked for the\n&gt; &gt; sa=\r\nke of public safety. This letter along with a DVD of the sex video was\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ndelivered to the Chief Minister of Karnataka state two hours before the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n videotape was first aired. Clearly, the attack was well planned and execut=\r\ned\n&gt; &gt; across many locations, and was persistently carried out over several=\r\n days.\n&gt; &gt; This is not the work of some isolated individuals.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ther=\r\ne were warnings given to individuals in the ashram that their phones\n&gt; &gt; we=\r\nre being tapped and that they better leave to save their own lives,\n&gt; &gt; bec=\r\nause something horrible was about to happen. One friendly man based in\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nPune who runs a magazine and is a devotee of Swami Nithyananda, told the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; ashram a week in advance of the attack that some such catastrophe would\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; happen. He named his source as a man in the Bangalore Press Club. Anothe=\r\nr\n&gt; &gt; publisher in Hyderabad who distributes Swami Nithyananda&#39;s books in T=\r\nelugu,\n&gt; &gt; called three times to warn that a graphic video would be release=\r\nd and gave a\n&gt; &gt; precise time for this to happen. It was also reported that=\r\n an American\n&gt; &gt; devotee who had fallen out of the ashram was working in as=\r\nsociation with one\n&gt; &gt; Jody Razdik who specializes in guru bashing at a pro=\r\nminent web site. He was\n&gt; &gt; being helped by an Indian based in San Diego, w=\r\nho was once very deeply\n&gt; &gt; involved inside the Nithyananda organization bu=\r\nt had turned malicious. The\n&gt; &gt; only man who has openly come out as the mai=\r\nn accuser was an ashramite who\n&gt; &gt; had a falling out when he got demoted du=\r\ne to his conduct. It was recently\n&gt; &gt; reported that he had a prior criminal=\r\n record against him but nobody in the\n&gt; &gt; ashram had checked out his backgr=\r\nound before admitting him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There were constant threats received to=\r\n harass the ashramites and scare them\n&gt; &gt; away, with claims that &quot;narcotics=\r\n will be planted to cause arrest warrants.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; The actions by the police w=\r\nere being leaked to the media ahead of time and\n&gt; &gt; even to the opposing si=\r\nde, leading to numerous &quot;tips&quot; received by &quot;friends&quot;\n&gt; &gt; asking the ashram =\r\ndwellers to run away before &quot;the attack comes.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But even after a c=\r\nouple of weeks since the scandal has erupted, the lawyers\n&gt; &gt; for Swami Nit=\r\nhyananda&#39;s ashram have failed to get copies of any concrete\n&gt; &gt; charges fil=\r\ned with the police, except a few trivial ones. Each time they\n&gt; &gt; approach =\r\nfor specific details they are told that there is no formal charge,\n&gt; &gt; exce=\r\npt relatively minor ones. So the intimidation has been carried out\n&gt; &gt; main=\r\nly through media reports, without any legal due process starting where\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nfacts and arguments could get cross-examined. This lack of formal charges\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; has enabled an atmosphere of intimidation using rumors and threats that\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; cannot be pinned down officially.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is important to contrast =\r\nthis with the manner in which Indian media\n&gt; &gt; treats scandals facing Islam=\r\nic or Christian groups. The numerous scandals\n&gt; &gt; occurring overseas often =\r\nget blocked by Indian media entirely, or are given\n&gt; &gt; mild treatment with =\r\ntremendous sensitivity, in order to be seen as &quot;secular&quot;\n&gt; &gt; and not &quot;commu=\r\nnal.&quot; By contrast every kind of allegation against any Hindu\n&gt; &gt; group gets=\r\n clubbed in one homogeneous category and treated as a social\n&gt; &gt; scourge eq=\r\nuivalent to terror groups.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The media&#39;s hounding mentality and mafi=\r\na tactics deserve to be condemned. In\n&gt; &gt; the Swami Nithyananda case, they =\r\nhave used carrots and sticks to lure and\n&gt; &gt; threaten, using whatever would=\r\n get them more sensational footage. Several TV\n&gt; &gt; stations and journalists=\r\n camped out in Haridwar and sent me emails\n&gt; &gt; requesting my help in arrang=\r\ning an interview. When I failed to deliver\n&gt; &gt; (because it was not up to me=\r\n to deliver any such thing), some of them turned\n&gt; &gt; nasty against me. One =\r\nTV woman promised the swami&#39;s people &quot;positive&quot;\n&gt; &gt; coverage if she got an =\r\nexclusive. But after the interview, she betrayed them\n&gt; &gt; and turned it int=\r\no more distortion and smut. This led Swami Nithyananda&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; handlers to gi=\r\nve interviews to more stations in order to counteract this\n&gt; &gt; distortion. =\r\nBut the more they said before TV cameras, the worse the scandal\n&gt; &gt; became.=\r\n One station was blatant in its threat to the swami&#39;s assistant: &quot;If\n&gt; &gt; yo=\r\nu don&#39;t give us an interview right away, we will show you the power of the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; media to destroy you.&quot; At one point a major TV station also wanted to d=\r\nrag\n&gt; &gt; in Ramakrishna Mission with similar allegations, but someone was ab=\r\nle to\n&gt; &gt; stop that.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Failures of Swami Nithyananda&#39;s Organization\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hindu tradition separates three kinds of Varna (skills), each repr=\r\nesenting a\n&gt; &gt; form of social capital, and these three were never supposed =\r\nto be\n&gt; &gt; concentrated in a single person, thereby preventing too much conc=\r\nentration\n&gt; &gt; of power. I use the terms Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya not =\r\nas birth based\n&gt; &gt; &quot;caste,&quot; but as merit based social capital and areas of =\r\ncompetence. The\n&gt; &gt; Brahmin job description focuses on spirituality and res=\r\nearch; Kshatriya on\n&gt; &gt; governance, politics and leadership; and Vaishyas o=\r\nn commerce and financial\n&gt; &gt; capital. Swami Nithyananda had persons with Br=\r\nahmin qualities performing\n&gt; &gt; duties that demand Kshatriya and Vaishya ski=\r\nlls. This was counterproductive.\n&gt; &gt; The ashram leaders were selected and t=\r\nrained for skills and roles that are\n&gt; &gt; very different than this situation=\r\n demands. Too often their bhakti and\n&gt; &gt; spiritual practice substituted for=\r\n professional competence in managing a\n&gt; &gt; rapidly growing global enterpris=\r\ne. The sole emphasis was placed on\n&gt; &gt; traditional Brahmin qualities, and n=\r\none on what would be considered\n&gt; &gt; Kshatriya qualities.\n&gt; &gt; For example, t=\r\nhere are a large number of white devotees who do have\n&gt; &gt; Kshatriyata - lea=\r\ndership expertise, courage and commitment. But even after\n&gt; &gt; this attack t=\r\nhe ashram organization has blundered in its failure to leverage\n&gt; &gt; and dep=\r\nloy them. I met some of these Westerners at the Kumbh and found them\n&gt; &gt; re=\r\nmarkably willing to stand up for their guru, but nobody had bothered to\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n organize them and take advantage of the fact that Swami Nithyananda has a\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; global following. Instead of such initiatives to deal with the crisis, =\r\nhis\n&gt; &gt; organization was in utter chaos, reacting to each &quot;hit&quot; by the othe=\r\nr side.\n&gt; &gt; Its leaders were running scared, driven by one rumor after anot=\r\nher.\n&gt; &gt; Decisions were being made in desperation and panic. The group was\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; cognitively disoriented and many of its members were psychologically\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; breaking down.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The organization was too much of a one-man show w=\r\nith the leaders operating\n&gt; &gt; like children dependent on the swami for ever=\r\ny decision. The swami had\n&gt; &gt; become the iconic object of the ashram&#39;s inne=\r\nr circle. Their proximity to\n&gt; &gt; him became their measure of personal power=\r\n and identity. This is classical\n&gt; &gt; cult-like behavior that cannot survive=\r\n the onslaughts that are inevitable\n&gt; &gt; nowadays. Such a concentration of a=\r\nll varnas into one man not only makes an\n&gt; &gt; enterprise incompetent, but it=\r\n also can also get to the leader&#39;s head and\n&gt; &gt; make him power hungry. Espe=\r\ncially when the guru has siddhis, this power can\n&gt; &gt; easily become co-opted=\r\n by his ego into a dangerous mixture. The result is\n&gt; &gt; that he surrounds h=\r\nimself with sycophants who tell him what he wants to\n&gt; &gt; hear, and this fee=\r\ndback loop of self glorification turns into group\n&gt; &gt; delusion.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I =\r\nnoticed this in the form of the inner circle&#39;s inability to make common\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n sense judgments, and their misrepresenting the facts to their leader by\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; giving him too much &quot;good news.&quot; The result was that the honest truth did=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; not come out fast enough to allow pragmatic and realistic planning. I =\r\nhad a\n&gt; &gt; difficult time to get dependable information, and the stories kep=\r\nt changing\n&gt; &gt; not only over time but also between one person and another w=\r\nithin the group.\n&gt; &gt; I could not tell if there was a cover up and if new li=\r\nes were fabricated to\n&gt; &gt; cover prior lies. In such an atmosphere one canno=\r\nt tell which individuals\n&gt; &gt; might have a separate stake and vested interes=\r\nt from the group. Lacking\n&gt; &gt; competent Kshatriyas, the swami had not antic=\r\nipated that such a crisis was\n&gt; &gt; ever possible, despite the fact that outs=\r\niders (including myself in my 2-day\n&gt; &gt; talks at his ashram) had explained =\r\nto them the threats facing every\n&gt; &gt; prominent Hindu mahatma today.\n&gt; &gt; Whi=\r\nle on the one hand I blame those in positions of responsibility at the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nashram, ultimately Swami Nithyananda bears the responsibility as he selecte=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; them, defined their roles, evaluated their performance, motivated and=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; supervised them very closely. In this regard, his spiritual capabiliti=\r\nes had\n&gt; &gt; failed to evaluate those very close to him as well as the extern=\r\nal reality.\n&gt; &gt; An enlightened master must do better than this, or else he =\r\nmust not try to\n&gt; &gt; control everything so personally.\n&gt; &gt; I acknowledge tha=\r\nt being a global guru is very demanding today, given that\n&gt; &gt; one has to re=\r\npresent a very old tradition authentically and yet in a manner\n&gt; &gt; that app=\r\neals to modern people. This is why Hindu leaders need a crash course\n&gt; &gt; on=\r\n matters that are well beyond the traditional education in their own\n&gt; &gt; sa=\r\nmpradayas (lineages).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hindu Chaos\n&gt; &gt; Swami Nithyananda&#39;s own supp=\r\nort base in India has started to distance itself\n&gt; &gt; out of self preservati=\r\non amidst all the rumors and slander. His closest\n&gt; &gt; supporters were not a=\r\npproached soon enough with his side of the story, and\n&gt; &gt; by the time they =\r\nwere approached the damage to his credibility was already\n&gt; &gt; irreversible.=\r\n They did not want to risk being associated with a &quot;fallen\n&gt; &gt; guru.&quot; Many =\r\nHindu gurus have started to publicly lash out against the\n&gt; &gt; &quot;fallen godma=\r\nn&quot;; others became silent or neutral publicly, while offering\n&gt; &gt; private sy=\r\nmpathy but refusing to stick their necks out.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One factor is that t=\r\nhe swami&#39;s approach was too conservative for some and\n&gt; &gt; too liberal for o=\r\nthers. It is too filled with deities, symbols and rituals\n&gt; &gt; of a very ort=\r\nhodox kind for the aesthetic taste of modern global gurus who\n&gt; &gt; propagate=\r\n a whitened, Westernized &quot;clean&quot; Hinduism that is abstract and\n&gt; &gt; metaphys=\r\nical but devoid of imagery associated with &quot;primitive paganism.&quot; At\n&gt; &gt; the=\r\n other end of the spectrum are orthodox Hindu leaders who find his idea\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n of youthful dancing, celebration, and liberal atmosphere to be not &quot;real&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Hinduism. A couple of shankaracharyas interviewed on NDTV lashed out ag=\r\nainst\n&gt; &gt; &quot;false&quot; gurus and claimed that only the shankaracharyas had the a=\r\nuthority to\n&gt; &gt; certify who was qualified to be a guru. So Swami Nithyanand=\r\na fits neither\n&gt; &gt; end of this spectrum.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Many of the gurus I met h=\r\nave told me in confidence that they fear that\n&gt; &gt; similar attacks are comin=\r\ng to more Hindu gurus, but that there is no central\n&gt; &gt; Hindu mechanism to =\r\ndeal with these episodes along the lines of various\n&gt; &gt; Church mechanisms t=\r\nhat intervene when Christianity faces a scandal. I sent\n&gt; &gt; feelers to the =\r\nHindu Dharma Acharya Sabha as to whether it should offer to\n&gt; &gt; step in and=\r\n take over the ashram and its related organizations, thereby\n&gt; &gt; bringing n=\r\new management to clean up matters and bring stability to the\n&gt; &gt; enterprise=\r\n. I was told that while this was a &quot;good idea in principle,&quot; it\n&gt; &gt; was not=\r\n practical because HDAS is simply not set up to deal with this.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Th=\r\ne Way Forward\n&gt; &gt; My overriding concern throughout this investigation has b=\r\neen to find a way\n&gt; &gt; to do damage control in order to protect the broader =\r\ninterests of dharma.\n&gt; &gt; This requires a pragmatic approach. Given the stat=\r\ne of affairs, it seems\n&gt; &gt; that the mess cannot be created without the swam=\r\ni leaving the movement and\n&gt; &gt; going into a strictly private life of medita=\r\ntion and self inquiry. I worry\n&gt; &gt; for the young ashramites who I feel are =\r\namazing individuals but in need of\n&gt; &gt; proper mentoring. They have a solid =\r\ncommitment to the cause and their\n&gt; &gt; personal spiritual paths, but they la=\r\nck the sophistication and maturity to\n&gt; &gt; deal with what they face today.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Swami Nithyananda should resign immediately and hand over all his\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; organizations to senior spiritual masters, preferably Shaivites practici=\r\nng\n&gt; &gt; the Shiva Sutras and related traditions. He told me in an interview =\r\nhat I\n&gt; &gt; recorded on March 9th that he was willing to leave everything and=\r\n become a\n&gt; &gt; wandering sadhu again. I wish that interview had been aired.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The new spiritual leaders would give the ashram a new life and cha=\r\nnce to\n&gt; &gt; revive itself. It could either remain a place for spiritual trai=\r\nning or turn\n&gt; &gt; itself into a Hindu social service organization. Either wa=\r\ny it would be a\n&gt; &gt; better outcome than the likely alternative of the gover=\r\nnment stepping in to\n&gt; &gt; take over the ashram and turn it over to administr=\r\nators who are not\n&gt; &gt; positively disposed to Hindu spirituality =96 as has =\r\nhappened in numerous\n&gt; &gt; similar cases of government takeovers of Hindu tem=\r\nples and organizations\n&gt; &gt; despite government claims of its actions being &quot;=\r\nsecular&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Besides giving up the organization, Swami Nithyananda sh=\r\nould return to his\n&gt; &gt; personal sadhana under the guidance of these spiritu=\r\nal leaders. Let them\n&gt; &gt; evaluate him and his organization, and issue their=\r\n independent report to the\n&gt; &gt; public. Swami Nithyananda should fearlessly =\r\nand humbly submit himself to\n&gt; &gt; their judgment of what happened and what t=\r\nhe remedies ought to be.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hinduism has survived for many millennia =\r\nand faced many kinds of crises,\n&gt; &gt; just like all the other major religions=\r\n of the world. It has its own\n&gt; &gt; internal resources and mechanisms to deal=\r\n with such situations. These need\n&gt; &gt; to be put to use and they need to bec=\r\nome modernized. This is not the last\n&gt; &gt; such scandal Hindu groups are goin=\r\ng to face in the near future.\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Sense of Distinction and of=\r\n good and evil is bound to persist so long as\n&gt; &gt; one does not realize God&quot;=\r\n - Ramakrishna Paramahamsa\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
