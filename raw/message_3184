The expression golden symblizes something absolut=\r\nely pure and pristine. For example, if you read the description of Aadya Sh=\r\nakti (root energy) in Saptashati rahasya, she is described as golden hued (=\r\ntapta kaanchana varNaabhaa) though the three shaktis emanating from that Aa=\r\ndya Shakti (Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati) are described differen=\r\ntly.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Hiranyagarbha is the purest one, the source of all. We are essen=\r\ntially talking about the Supreme Cosmic Being, though one could differentia=\r\nte subtly and say that Hiranyagarbha is the source of the Supreme Cosmic Be=\r\ning. Hiranyagarbha is the Supreme Cosmic Source and Supreme Cosmic Being is=\r\n the transformation of that source into this universe.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, one m=\r\nay practically view Hiranyagarbha, Parama Purusha (supreme cosmic being) an=\r\nd Ishwara (supreme lord) as synonyms.\n&gt;  \n&gt; When the universe arose from Pa=\r\nrama Purusha, specific deities like Shiva and Vishnu arose from Parama Puru=\r\nsha and they play specific roles in this universe. But they have overcome t=\r\nhe ego (that made them play specific roles in this universe) *completely* a=\r\nnd realized their nature as identical to Parama Purusha. Thus, people may w=\r\norship Shiva, Vishnu etc as supreme cosmic being also.\n&gt;  \n&gt; (2) Praana is =\r\nthat which causes motion in mind and makes it function and become aware of =\r\nvarious things. It is the kinetic aspect of Shakti. Without this kinetic en=\r\nergy, mind will be unable to see, hear, feel etc.\n&gt;  \n&gt; When Brahman manife=\r\nsts as an individualized consciousness, it has various aspects - ahamkara (=\r\nI-ness), chitta (conditioning), buddhi (logic), manas (mind) etc. The divis=\r\nion of Brahman into &quot;I&quot; and &quot;Others&quot; operates through manas. Praana is the =\r\nkinetic energy that allows manas to observe the objects within Brahman and =\r\nto affect changes in them.\n&gt;  \n&gt; (3) Each prajapati is the source of all be=\r\nings in a specific realm of existence. Hiranyagarbha is the source of all b=\r\neings in all realms of existence. They are similar, but at a different abst=\r\nraction level.\n&gt;  \n&gt; (4) Viraat means the supreme lord. It is synonymous to=\r\n Parama Purusha or Supreme Cosmic Being, who is a transformation of Hiranya=\r\ngarbha.\n&gt;  \n&gt; (5) Many Krishna worshippers worship Krishna as Virat Purusha=\r\n and believe him to be the source of all beings. Many Shiva worshippers wor=\r\nship Shiva as Viraat Purusha and believe him to be the source of all beings=\r\n. In other words, people are not directly trying for communion with supreme=\r\n cosmic being, but through a specific manifestation of the supreme cosmic b=\r\neing. You worship Krishna or Shiva or Ganesha or Surya or some other deity =\r\nas a specific form with specific role in the universe and eventually try to=\r\n realize that deity as the supreme source of the entire universe.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Hir=\r\nanyagarbha is attainable through jnaana. Bhakti is easier towards a specifi=\r\nc form like Krishna or Shiva with specific attributes, rather than Hiranyag=\r\narbha. Once bhakti maarga purifies a person, one can develop in jnaana maar=\r\nga and realize the beloved deity with a specific form to be the supreme sou=\r\nrce of all.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyot=\r\nish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short =\r\nHomam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n\n&gt;      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt;      Spi=\r\nrituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings:=\r\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; --------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Could you please explain a few terms and their differences?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n1) Hiranyagarbha - how is it different from Shiva/Vishnu/Narayana/Kali etc.=\r\n Is it the same an Ishwara?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; 2) What is &quot;Prana&quot; or &quot;vital force&quot; a=\r\ns some people translate the term. Is it just a manifestation of Shakti? Wha=\r\nt it it&#39;s relation to Brahman.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; 3) What is Prajapati? How is it di=\r\nfferent from Hiranyagarbha? \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; 4) What is viraj? How is it differen=\r\nt from Hiranyagarbha?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; 5) In the last few centuries or more, we ha=\r\nve never read of any sadhaka or yogi who has done any sadhanas for Hiranyag=\r\narbha or Viraj. We only read of them when someone is discussion the Upanish=\r\nats, not practical sadhana. We see only sadhakas attaining communion with d=\r\neities like Siva, Vishnu, Krishna, Kali etc. What could be the reason?\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance for your time and patience!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; -Regard=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
