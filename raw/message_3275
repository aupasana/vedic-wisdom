It is not like he normally uses that phrase often or anything. So I =\r\nwas a little frigid for a second, then he repeated it again, and I too repe=\r\nated it in a flow and said &quot;Jai Ramji ki&quot; - loud and clear. \n=C2=A0\nNow as =\r\nI look back I find it very interesting, because the next day while I was wr=\r\niting these mail I had spend the major part of the day thinking of Lord Ram=\r\na.\n=C2=A0\nI personally am a firm believer in Rama as God and have often pra=\r\nyed to him.

Again as you already know, Shudra\n&gt; was not B.C., OBC, KBC, HSBC=\r\n etc.. :-). but a fallen man, a mean\n&gt; thinking man. I have to agree if you=\r\n say that Ganvaar and Shudra can\n&gt; also be said about Woaman however lookin=\r\ng at the Doha and general\n&gt; prevailing conditions of society, it seems that=\r\n he used those words for\n&gt; Men.\n&gt; \n&gt; Grammar...Hmmmm. i don&#39;t know if he ha=\r\ns really used proper grammer in\n&gt; such Dohas.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are verse in Bhagv=\r\nad Gita which can be criticised by people from\n&gt; other faiths if they are t=\r\naken literaly and without understanding\n&gt; personality of Krishna.\n&gt; \n&gt; ***\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding Ramachandra, Thank you for making clear, your notable friend=\r\n&#39;s\n&gt; view and your detailed explanation by giving examples.

Let me try=\r\n again. He is not really saying\n&gt; that Sri Rama was not a self realized man=\r\n. Infact he quite agrees that\n&gt; Sri Rama was an Avatar of God. What he says=\r\n is that, (his opinion)=C3=82\n&gt; God did not descend as Sri Rama in order to=\r\n be worshipped. He descended\n&gt; in order to lead by example. That is why the=\r\n text is called Rama+ayana.\n&gt; A path that an ordinary man can and should fo=\r\nllow. One of\n&gt; principles.=C3=82 Compare this to the name of the other grea=\r\nt epic,\n&gt; Mahabharata, which was not named &quot;Krishna+ayana&quot; . One cannot fol=\r\nlow\n&gt; Krishna&#39;s path.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; Whenever, according to him, we attribu=\r\nte Godhood to Sri Rama, our\n&gt; subcsious mind will create a blockage, a divi=\r\nde between the worshipper\n&gt; and the worshipped and thus make it impossible =\r\nto lead a life like Rama\n&gt; did. BUt if we try to look at it like the story =\r\nof a great king, a nobel\n&gt; man, a devoted husband etc, we have a better cha=\r\nnce of following such a\n&gt; life.\n&gt; &gt; An ordinary man cannot lead the life of=\r\n a God but he can follow the\n&gt; life of a great man.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; Similarl=\r\ny, even today lot of people advise that one should try to\n&gt; become like Viv=\r\nekananda, or that this country needs its youth to be like\n&gt; Vivekanadas in =\r\nteh future. It does not mean Vivekanada was not a self\n&gt; realized=C3=82 sai=\r\nnt of highest calibre, but his life&#39;s image is like=C3=82\n&gt; one who=C3=82 l=\r\nived like a lion among sheep of ordinary=C3=82 men, fearless\n&gt; and uncompro=\r\nmising and principled. If every=C3=82 person would constantly\n&gt; think that =\r\nVivekanada was a saint=C3=82 who worked by the pwoer of a deity\n&gt; or due to=\r\n his extreme spirituality or the blessing of a great guru,=C3=82\n&gt; no one w=\r\nill ever make an attempt to be inspired by him or=C3=82 emulate\n&gt; his way o=\r\nf living.Vivekanada was a spiritual giant, but=C3=82 the image he\n&gt; project=\r\ned was one of a tireless, fearless KarmaYogi. THAT can inspire\n&gt; people.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 On the other hand=C3=82 you will never hear anyone advi=\r\nsing that\n&gt; one should try to lead a life like Ramarkishna.=C3=82 =C3=82 Th=\r\nat is\n&gt; impossible.

So as\n&gt; per my friend, it is more =\r\nimportant to emulate Rama&#39;s ideas than to\n&gt; worship Rama.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) He considers the Ramcharit Manas, from a literary ang=\r\nle, a\n&gt; hodgepodge of langauges and styles ranging from Awadhi to BrajBhasa=\r\n. An\n&gt; author&#39;s paradise (since many rules of composition has been flouted)=\r\n but\n&gt; a critics nightmare. Also, there is a line in there which equates wo=\r\nmen\n&gt; with animals or something similar. He believes that was introduces in=\r\n\n&gt; the text because Tulasidas had a problem controlling his own lust.\n&gt; The=\r\nrefore, he ended up composing a sentence derogatory to women.\n&gt; Further, he=\r\n argues that if Sri Rama is worshipped as God, then the\n&gt; purpose of his Av=\r\natarhood goes waste. Sri Rama was there to explain idea\n&gt; way of life. Kris=\r\nhna was there to be worshipped because Krishna was\n&gt; maximum ability of God=\r\n on this plane. Nothing can be more God than\n&gt; Krishna was on this plane, s=\r\no he thinks.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The above are merely his opi=\r\nnions, feel free to disagree.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One reques=\r\nt, if you can speak to him about his thought on Food\n&gt; habits, it&#39;ll be gre=\r\nat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have been out of touch with him sin=\r\nce August, been busy myself.\n&gt; But will ask him.

I met him about two years back. What first\n&gt; attracted me to=C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C3=82 towards him was his impeccable honestly. I mean,\n&gt; he is a maniac=\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 when it comes to=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 honestly.=C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A=C3=82 If\n&gt; someone were to put a gun to his head and ask him to j=\r\nust say a simple,\n&gt; harmless=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 lie, like sun rises in th=\r\ne west, he would not say it.\n&gt; Therefore he never jokes with anyone too! He=\r\n has actually never\n&gt; ever=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 spoken even a single lie in=\r\n his whole life, big or small.\n&gt; When he was in his school, once his teache=\r\nr told him that Indian\n&gt; languages are richer than English, he believed his=\r\n teacher. Later\n&gt; someone else told him English is more comprehensive langu=\r\nage and the\n&gt; world cannot do with it. He got confused. Since that day, he =\r\nbought\n&gt; himself two thick fat dictionaries, one English, one Hindi and for=\r\n ten\n&gt; years every day he spend one hour reading the\n&gt; &gt; English dictionary=\r\n and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one hour reading the Hindi dictionary apart from reading=C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A=C3=82 up\n&gt; volumes of Hindi and English literature.=C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C3=82 When I asked him why, he\n&gt; just said it is because he wanted to b=\r\ne=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 equally adept at both the\n&gt; languages so that one da=\r\ny he can take a really detached view to judge\n&gt; the truth about=C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C3=82 which is more comprehensive language! As I said,\n&gt; he has an unco=\r\nmpromising attitude when it comes to finding out the truth\n&gt; about anything=\r\n. By education, he is a Phd is mathematics. He has worked\n&gt; in different fi=\r\nelds, from banking to education to journalism. He did not\n&gt; last for long i=\r\nn most places. He speaks and writes fluently, English,\n&gt; Bengali, Hindi, Ur=\r\ndu, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he is\n&gt; learning Tamil. He compo=\r\nses poetry in all the above languages. When he\n&gt; was in college, he conside=\r\nred himself an atheist. While applying for a\n&gt; job he had kept the place ma=\r\nkered for religion as blank. When the clerk\n&gt; who was supposed to take the =\r\nforms saw that blank space,\n&gt; &gt; he asked\n&gt; &gt; &gt; my friend&#39;s name. Hearing a =\r\nHindu name, the clerk wrote &quot;Hindu&quot;.\n&gt; Seeing this, my friend snatched the =\r\nform from the clerk and tore it up\n&gt; right there. Because, he considered hi=\r\nmself an atheist and writing Hindu\n&gt; in the form would have been a lie.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So this gives a basic idea of the man I am s=\r\npeaking of. All his\n&gt; friends, whoever knows him, calls him Rama of Kaliyug=\r\na.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One day, long back, he was going to of=\r\nfice for some urgent meeting.\n&gt; His way to office passed by a Krishna templ=\r\ne. As he was passing by\n&gt; in=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 his scooter, suddenly he =\r\nfelt a strange urge to go into the\n&gt; temple. He says he still does not know=\r\n why he went inside the temple,\n&gt; but he did. That was at 9 o clock in the =\r\nmorning. Next when he sees his\n&gt; watch it is 4:30 in the evening! And he ha=\r\ns no knowledge of how the time\n&gt; went. When he asked the priest, the priest=\r\n said that he went into the\n&gt; temple sat down and just stayed as he was for=\r\n the whole time without any\n&gt; movement. The priest somehow felt scared to d=\r\nisturb him. But my friend\n&gt; had no idea why this happened. He remembered no=\r\nthing, as if he was in\n&gt; deep sleep.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Then=\r\n he started meditating at home, and it was there=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 that =\r\nhe\n&gt; got visions etc of Krishna. He does not say much about these, infact\n&gt;=\r\n most people who know him also do not know these things. But once he was\n&gt; =\r\nin samadhi for 72 hours, not moving from his meditation seat, in the\n&gt; exac=\r\nt same place and same position for 3 days continuously.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=\r\n=82 Only\n&gt; his wife and close relatives know about this incident. I believe=\r\n\n&gt; nowadays when ever he sits for meditation he often enters the state of\n&gt;=\r\n Samadhi. When someone asked him how he felt during samadhi, he just said\n&gt;=\r\n it feels as if the whole universe orginates from me. I am the sun, the\n&gt; m=\r\noon, the stars, the planets, the animals, men, women, children, the\n&gt; wind,=\r\n the water, the space, smaller than the atom and bigger than\n&gt; everything. =\r\nIt cannot be accurately desribed.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 He considers Sri\n&gt; K=\r\nrishna to be God and=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 Lord Rama to be the ideal man.Tha=\r\nt is why\n&gt; he does not like the Ramacharit Manas because he thinks it eleva=\r\nted\n&gt; &gt; Sri=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 Rama to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; level of a God whereas t=\r\nhe aim of the orginal Valmiki Ramayana was\n&gt; to show Sri Rama as an ideal m=\r\nan,=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 not a God.The difference he\n&gt; says is that, an ide=\r\nal man is someone who can be emulated, an ordinary\n&gt; man can and should aim=\r\n to become like the ideal. But a God cannot be\n&gt; emulated by ordinary men. =\r\nOne cannot become Krishna, but one=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 can\n&gt; try to lead h=\r\nis life like Rama. I have argued with him over this, but I\n&gt; am merely stat=\r\ning his idea. Also he does not have a Guru - a human guru\n&gt; at least, and a=\r\ndvises people to not trust most Gurus these days.\n&gt; Needless to say, he is =\r\nnot an atheist any more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Later he had onc=\r\ne=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 mentioned he knew the relation he had with\n&gt; all the=\r\n people around him in his past lives. His mother he says, was his\n&gt; daughte=\r\nr in his past life etc. Nowadays he spends a lot of time on\n&gt; different int=\r\nernet forums interacting with people, specially=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 with\n&gt;=\r\n those in=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 the age group of 18 to 30, discussing anythi=\r\nng and\n&gt; everything with them, from Indian politics to Indian history, reli=\r\ngion,\n&gt; etc etc. His idea is to impart right knowledge to young people who =\r\nwill\n&gt; be the future of this country.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He =\r\nis am omnivorous person.

It is not like he normally uses that phrase often or anything. S=\r\no I was a little frigid for a second, then he repeated it again, and I too =\r\nrepeated it in a flow and said &quot;Jai Ramji ki&quot; - loud and clear. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Now as I look back I find it very interesting, because t=\r\nhe next day while I was writing these mail I had spend the major part of th=\r\ne day thinking of Lord Rama.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I personally am a=\r\n firm believer in Rama as God and have often prayed to him.

It seemed to me that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Paramahansa Yogananda =\r\nalso have referred to this issue without&lt;BR&gt;&gt; mentioning Thakur&#39;s name d=\r\nirectly (I may be wrong but i strongly felt&lt;BR&gt;&gt; like that when i read t=\r\nhe &#39;Autobiography of a yogi&#39; some 4/5\n years&lt;BR&gt;&gt; back). Sardanada in a =\r\nsense did &#39;Back engineering job to bail out :)&#39; .&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If we go by &#39;Kami=\r\nni&#39; word literaly, then Thakur could be portrayed as&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Women basher. =\r\nbut we all know that Thakur refffered to Lust and Desire&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of worldly=\r\n objects whenever he spoke those two words. Jumping on&lt;BR&gt;&gt; conclusion w=\r\nithout properly studying/thinking about Thakur&#39;s life, just&lt;BR&gt;&gt; on lite=\r\nral meaning of those 2 words would be a sure blasphemy.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sa=\r\nme way, I also thought about Sant Tulasi das ji. I was telling myself&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; that can a saint of his devotion and poetic skills and add to that&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; steadfastly devoted to Lord Rama (Who never shown slightest dis-resepct&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; to women) , utter such words and saggrigate &#39;Nari&#39; for nothing. I w=\r\nas&lt;BR&gt;&gt; not convinced. One of the &#39;Dohas&#39; of Tulasi Das goes like this -=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; [Prem, Ahinsa], Satya Vachan aur Par-stri Matusamaan|&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Inase agar prabhu\n na mile to Tulasi Juth Jabaan ||&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; (I have given this doha out of memory and its quite possible that f=\r\nirst&lt;BR&gt;&gt; two wrods are wrong in the doha)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If a poet is=\r\n asking to look at a woman as a Mother, how could he mean&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &#39;Nari&#39; to=\r\n be &#39;Tadan Adhikari&#39;? As you pointed out, on a look at surface&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (at =\r\nthe levelof text), it means which many belives but you and me need&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nto look at little deeper. A person who did the world of Good to Indias&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; ordinary masses by rewriting the whole Ramayana in a language which&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; people (from north) could easily understand, The man who gave immortal=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &#39;Hanumaan Chalisa&#39; can not be lebeled so casually as &#39;Nari basher&#39;=\r\n or&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &#39;Shudra Hater&#39; (As Mayaavati brand poticians would capitalise).=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Regarding your questions of why Pashu are only Nari and n=\r\not Nara....&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I think he was reffering to Men with the words=\r\n Ganvaar and Shudra\n and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Pashu Nari must be a joint statement. Agai=\r\nn as you already know, Shudra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; was not B.C., OBC, KBC, HSBC etc.. :-=\r\n). but a fallen man, a mean&lt;BR&gt;&gt; thinking man. I have to agree if you sa=\r\ny that Ganvaar and Shudra can&lt;BR&gt;&gt; also be said about Woaman however loo=\r\nking at the Doha and general&lt;BR&gt;&gt; prevailing conditions of society, it s=\r\neems that he used those words for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Men.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Grammar...H=\r\nmmmm. i don&#39;t know if he has really used proper grammer in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; such Doh=\r\nas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; There are verse in Bhagvad Gita which can be criticise=\r\nd by people from&lt;BR&gt;&gt; other faiths if they are taken literaly and withou=\r\nt understanding&lt;BR&gt;&gt; personality of Krishna.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ***&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Regarding Ramachandra, Thank you for making clear, your notable =\r\nfriend&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt; view and your detailed explanation by giving examples. But=\r\n again i&lt;BR&gt;&gt; don&#39;t think that to consider Rama as God will actually be\n=\r\n blockage&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in leading life like him and that too when almost everybo=\r\ndy in Sanatan&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dharma knows him as God.

Let me try again. He is not really saying&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; that Sri Rama was not a self realized man. Infact he quite agrees th=\r\nat&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Rama was an Avatar of God. What he says is that, (his opinio=\r\nn)=C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; God did not descend as Sri Rama in order to be worshipped.=\r\n He descended&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in order to lead by example. That is why the text is =\r\ncalled Rama+ayana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; A path that an ordinary man can and should follo=\r\nw. One\n of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; principles.=C3=82 Compare this to the name of the other =\r\ngreat epic,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mahabharata, which was not named &quot;Krishna+ayana&quot; . One =\r\ncannot follow&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Krishna&#39;s path.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; When=\r\never, according to him, we attribute Godhood to Sri Rama, our&lt;BR&gt;&gt; subcs=\r\nious mind will create a blockage, a divide between the worshipper&lt;BR&gt;&gt; a=\r\nnd the worshipped and thus make it impossible to lead a life like Rama&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; did. BUt if we try to look at it like the story of a great king, a nobe=\r\nl&lt;BR&gt;&gt; man, a devoted husband etc, we have a better chance of following =\r\nsuch a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; life.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; An ordinary man cannot lead the life of a=\r\n God but he can follow the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; life of a great man.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Similarly, even today lot of people advise that one should tr=\r\ny to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; become like Vivekananda, or that this country needs its youth =\r\nto be like&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Vivekanadas in teh future. It does not mean Vivekanada w=\r\nas not a\n self&lt;BR&gt;&gt; realized=C3=82 saint of highest calibre, but his lif=\r\ne&#39;s image is like=C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; one who=C3=82 lived like a lion among sheep=\r\n of ordinary=C3=82 men, fearless&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and uncompromising and principled.=\r\n If every=C3=82 person would constantly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; think that Vivekanada was a=\r\n saint=C3=82 who worked by the pwoer of a deity&lt;BR&gt;&gt; or due to his extre=\r\nme spirituality or the blessing of a great guru,=C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; no one will =\r\never make an attempt to be inspired by him or=C3=82 emulate&lt;BR&gt;&gt; his way=\r\n of living.Vivekanada was a spiritual giant, but=C3=82 the image he&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n projected was one of a tireless, fearless KarmaYogi. THAT can inspire&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; people.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 On the other hand=C3=82=\r\n you will never hear anyone advising that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; one should try to lead a =\r\nlife like Ramarkishna.=C3=82 =C3=82 That is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; impossible. He=C3=82 wa=\r\ns God incarnate leading a charmed life.=C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; Similar is the case with the Avatar called Sri=C3=82\n Ramachandra&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; incomparison to Sri Krishna.

It is\n understandable&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; if he says Rama is an ideal man but hard to believe that such a great&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; person claims Rama is not God. Tempted to ask him what really is the=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; definition of God which differentiates Rama from Krishna?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Some months back I had a very lengthy, verbose =\r\nand charged/heated&lt;BR&gt;&gt; debate with him on whether Sri Rama is God or no=\r\nt. Mind you, these are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; all theoritical/ theological debates - nothi=\r\nng to do with actual&lt;BR&gt;&gt; spirituality. Finally he stopped the debate be=\r\ncause I was getting&lt;BR&gt;&gt; agitated and it would have affected our friends=\r\nhip.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Whenever his=\r\n opinion is asked on anything, he will only mention that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; what he ca=\r\nn support using logic. Therefore he never generally discusses&lt;BR&gt;&gt; spiri=\r\ntuality with anyone per se. He will discuss and debate scriptures&lt;BR&gt;&gt; u=\r\nsing exact quotations etc, (theology)=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 but not about\n m=\r\nysticism or&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sadhana or anything which=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 needs a =\r\nbelief system. That is why most&lt;BR&gt;&gt; people know him only as a very rati=\r\nonal, massively knowledgeable and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; uncorruptable=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=\r\n=82 human being.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 They have no cl=\r\nue about&lt;BR&gt;&gt; his meditations or anything. He never projects himself as =\r\nspiritual and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; generally would not discuss God in public.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Therefore our discussion wa=\r\ns also on those aspects which can be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; proved or disproved theologica=\r\nlly=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 - 1) Is Rama a God as per&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Valmiki Ramayana=\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 2) Is it wrong if people consider him as&lt;BR&gt;&gt; God=\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 .. 3) The merits of the Ramcharit Manas of Tulasidasj=\r\ni.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) To the firs=\r\nt question, he believes the answer is &quot;no&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) To the second question he says it cannot be =\r\ndebated from a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; spiritual point if it is right or\n wrong=C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C3=82 - but his personal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; opinion is that one should try to foll=\r\now the way of life shown by Sri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rama rather than worshipping him. H=\r\ne said, Sri Rama had mastery of all&lt;BR&gt;&gt; divine weapons. He could have d=\r\nestroyed Ravana and his whole army in a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; blink of an eye, right from=\r\n the place where he was=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 located when&lt;BR&gt;&gt; he first =\r\nheard the news of Sita&#39;s abduction, but Rama did not do so and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; inst=\r\nead chose the hard way of destroying Ravana - the human way. So as&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nper my friend, it is more important to emulate Rama&#39;s ideas than to&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n worship Rama.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 3)=\r\n He considers the Ramcharit Manas, from a literary angle, a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; hodgepo=\r\ndge of langauges and styles ranging from Awadhi to BrajBhasa. An&lt;BR&gt;&gt; au=\r\nthor&#39;s paradise (since many rules of composition has been flouted) but&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; a critics nightmare. Also, there is a line in there which equates women=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; with\n animals or something similar. He believes that was introduce=\r\ns in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the text because Tulasidas had a problem controlling his own l=\r\nust.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Therefore, he ended up composing a sentence derogatory to wome=\r\nn.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Further, he argues that if Sri Rama is worshipped as God, then t=\r\nhe&lt;BR&gt;&gt; purpose of his Avatarhood goes waste. Sri Rama was there to expl=\r\nain idea&lt;BR&gt;&gt; way of life. Krishna was there to be worshipped because Kr=\r\nishna was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; maximum ability of God on this plane. Nothing can be more=\r\n God than&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Krishna was on this plane, so he thinks.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The above are merely his opinions=\r\n, feel free to disagree.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Utpal,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; One request, if you can speak to=\r\n him about his thought on Food&lt;BR&gt;&gt; habits, it&#39;ll be great.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I have been out of touch with=\r\n\n him since August, been busy myself.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; But will ask him. However I d=\r\non&#39;t know whether he will respond. Because&lt;BR&gt;&gt; as I explained above, he=\r\n rarely discusses/debates anything from a purely&lt;BR&gt;&gt; spiritual angle.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; It was only by cha=\r\nnce that I found out one day about his meditations&lt;BR&gt;&gt; etc and then he =\r\nconfirmed them when asked.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; I have seen him debating with Vegans - purely from a scientific&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; point of view - about why there is no harm in having regulated amoun=\r\nts&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of meat (not red meat).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; But I say, as Narasimha said, this person should not be t=\r\naken as an&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ideal regarding food=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 habits. Sachin=\r\n can bat and score century&lt;BR&gt;&gt; even with a sore back, we will not be ab=\r\nle to do it.

I met him about two years back. What first&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; attracted me to=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 towards him was his impeccable hones=\r\ntly. I mean,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; he is a maniac=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 when it comes to=\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82\n honestly.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 If&lt;BR&gt;&gt; someone we=\r\nre to put a gun to his head and ask him to just say a simple,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; harml=\r\ness=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 lie, like sun rises in the west, he would not say =\r\nit.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Therefore he never jokes with anyone too! He has actually never=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ever=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 spoken even a single lie in his whole li=\r\nfe, big or small.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; When he was in his school, once his teacher told =\r\nhim that Indian&lt;BR&gt;&gt; languages are richer than English, he believed his =\r\nteacher. Later&lt;BR&gt;&gt; someone else told him English is more comprehensive =\r\nlanguage and the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; world cannot do with it. He got confused. Since th=\r\nat day, he bought&lt;BR&gt;&gt; himself two thick fat dictionaries, one English, =\r\none Hindi and for ten&lt;BR&gt;&gt; years every day he spend one hour reading the=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; English dictionary and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; one hour reading the=\r\n Hindi dictionary apart from reading=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 up&lt;BR&gt;&gt; volume=\r\ns of Hindi and English literature.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 When I asked him wh=\r\ny,\n he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; just said it is because he wanted to be=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=\r\n equally adept at both the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; languages so that one day he can take a =\r\nreally detached view to judge&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the truth about=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 =\r\nwhich is more comprehensive language! As I said,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; he has an uncompro=\r\nmising attitude when it comes to finding out the truth&lt;BR&gt;&gt; about anythi=\r\nng. By education, he is a Phd is mathematics. He has worked&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in diff=\r\nerent fields, from banking to education to journalism. He did not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; l=\r\nast for long in most places. He speaks and writes fluently, English,&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he is&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; learning Tamil. He composes poetry in all the above languages. When he&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; was in college, he considered himself an atheist. While applying for =\r\na&lt;BR&gt;&gt; job he had kept the place makered for religion as blank. When the=\r\n clerk&lt;BR&gt;&gt; who was supposed to take the forms saw that blank space,&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; he\n asked&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; my friend&#39;s name. Hearing a Hindu nam=\r\ne, the clerk wrote &quot;Hindu&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Seeing this, my friend snatched the for=\r\nm from the clerk and tore it up&lt;BR&gt;&gt; right there. Because, he considered=\r\n himself an atheist and writing Hindu&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in the form would have been a=\r\n lie.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; So this giv=\r\nes a basic idea of the man I am speaking of. All his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; friends, whoev=\r\ner knows him, calls him Rama of Kaliyuga.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=\r\n=C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; One day, long back, he was going to office for som=\r\ne urgent meeting.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; His way to office passed by a Krishna temple. As =\r\nhe was passing by&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 his scooter, suddenly he =\r\nfelt a strange urge to go into the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; temple. He says he still does no=\r\nt know why he went inside the temple,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; but he did. That was at 9 o c=\r\nlock in the morning. Next when he sees his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; watch it is 4:30 in the =\r\nevening! And he has no knowledge of how the\n time&lt;BR&gt;&gt; went. When he ask=\r\ned the priest, the priest said that he went into the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; temple sat dow=\r\nn and just stayed as he was for the whole time without any&lt;BR&gt;&gt; movement=\r\n. The priest somehow felt scared to disturb him. But my friend&lt;BR&gt;&gt; had =\r\nno idea why this happened. He remembered nothing, as if he was in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; d=\r\neep sleep.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Then h=\r\ne started meditating at home, and it was there=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 that he=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; got visions etc of Krishna. He does not say much about these, infa=\r\nct&lt;BR&gt;&gt; most people who know him also do not know these things. But once=\r\n he was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in samadhi for 72 hours, not moving from his meditation sea=\r\nt, in the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; exact same place and same position for 3 days continuousl=\r\ny.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 Only&lt;BR&gt;&gt; his wife and close relatives know abou=\r\nt this incident. I believe&lt;BR&gt;&gt; nowadays when ever he sits for meditatio=\r\nn he often enters the state of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Samadhi. When someone asked him how =\r\nhe\n felt during samadhi, he just said&lt;BR&gt;&gt; it feels as if the whole univ=\r\nerse orginates from me. I am the sun, the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; moon, the stars, the plan=\r\nets, the animals, men, women, children, the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; wind, the water, the sp=\r\nace, smaller than the atom and bigger than&lt;BR&gt;&gt; everything. It cannot be=\r\n accurately desribed.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 He considers Sri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Krishna=\r\n to be God and=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 Lord Rama to be the ideal man.That is w=\r\nhy&lt;BR&gt;&gt; he does not like the Ramacharit Manas because he thinks it eleva=\r\nted&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sri=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 Rama to the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; lev=\r\nel of a God whereas the aim of the orginal Valmiki Ramayana was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to =\r\nshow Sri Rama as an ideal man,=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 not a God.The differenc=\r\ne he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; says is that, an ideal man is someone who can be emulated, an =\r\nordinary&lt;BR&gt;&gt; man can and should aim to become like the ideal. But a God=\r\n cannot be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; emulated by ordinary men. One cannot become Krishna, but=\r\n one=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 can&lt;BR&gt;&gt; try to lead his life like\n Rama. I ha=\r\nve argued with him over this, but I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; am merely stating his idea. Als=\r\no he does not have a Guru - a human guru&lt;BR&gt;&gt; at least, and advises peop=\r\nle to not trust most Gurus these days.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Needless to say, he is not a=\r\nn atheist any more.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; Later he had once=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 mentioned he knew the relation he=\r\n had with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; all the people around him in his past lives.
