I told him\nthat i do not say that the people who eat mea=\r\nt are *Bad* people. I do\nnot also claim that Pure veggies are all and alway=\r\ns *Good* people. \nInfact, i have a couple of very good friends who are meat=\r\n eater and they\nare really good human beings.

My only point\nin\n&gt; &gt; Vegterianism is related to Compession ag=\r\nainst cruelty. Dharma (Non\nViolence)\n&gt; &gt; against Adharama (Killing Innocent=\r\n creatures).\n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; Anyway, my point is, I understand that it is good =\r\nto eat totally\nvegetarian food when you engage in sadhana, specially things=\r\n like\nhavans, or else it conflicts with your system badly.\n&gt; &gt; In my opinio=\r\nn, Saadhana or No Saadhana, if something is not correct\nwill remain Incorre=\r\nct. killing for filling stomach is if Not right then\nfor me it&#39;ll remain *N=\r\not right in all conditions*. it is a different\nmatter, if in future i succu=\r\nmb to challanging conditions and start\neating meat but even then it&#39;ll not =\r\njustify and make it proper thing.\n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi, Now i hope you=\r\n don&#39;t get offended by my message. i\napologise in advance for my bluntness.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; your second Para and some writings in your earlier message gives me\nim=\r\npression that you are heavily philosophising. Karama, Desh/kaal etc...\ndoes=\r\n not appeal me. to be very honest.\n&gt; &gt; In my opinon, if one can justify eat=\r\ning popular meat of chicken,\netc.. then anything under the Sun is eatable. =\r\nwith that logic, those\npeople who choose to eat Crab, Snakes, insects, cocr=\r\noaches are perfectly\nalright. even people who have started eating human fle=\r\nsh are also\nacceptable and not doing anything wrong as per the &#39;their&#39; thin=\r\nking.\n&gt; &gt; To talk about Karma, Conditioning, Culture etc..., and try to mak=\r\ne\nquality judgements by the logic of &#39;Direct killing&#39; and &#39;eating meat of\na=\r\nlready dead&#39; does not go well with me. it is just a philosophy to cover\nup.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Poeple born in Those cultures have become Vegetarian becuase they\nhate=\r\n killing invloved. I gave an example of one such person and there\nare few m=\r\nore i know. howvever they are very very very rare.\n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; The above ar=\r\nguments are incorrect.

Thats\nhow i also take it when such people talk such nonsens=\r\ne.\n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; Lastly, i&#39;ll add a philospohical thought. If so much of kill=\r\ning\nevery hourly basis, mostly for the sole purpose of *Craving* goes on in=\r\n\nthe world, and the prime mover is Human society, then how we hope to\nhave =\r\na peacefull world without blood shed and massacare. unfailing law\nof Karma =\r\n(Cause & effect) will find many ways to give it back to\n(in)Human societies=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; Om Shaanti Shaanti Shaanti:\n&gt; &gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@\n..&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope you or others won&#39;t=\r\n get offended by my mails.

However , I&#39;ll honestly\nsay that i have no answers fo=\r\nr &#39;life in a Plant&#39;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When I used to eat non-vegetarian food man=\r\ny of my friends who\nwere=C3=82 vegetarian people would give me a similar lo=\r\ngic, as you\nmentioned in your first writing. My point is, as a non-vegetari=\r\nan I am\nnot claiming that I have any special sensitivity to plants, over\nan=\r\nimals. No. All I am saying is that,=C3=82 this logic that many\nvegetarian p=\r\neople provide to convince average non-veg people to quit\neating non-veg, do=\r\nes not hold good.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I personally can not look at butchery =\r\nshops where one finds\nhanging goats. its pathetic site. People in their exc=\r\nitements stand in\nqueue to see the cutting of throat of a chicken and then =\r\ntake away that\nas parcel. The flash of so cruelly butchered Chicken or a Go=\r\nat or a cow\nor pig, is so tasty for the humans that they just overlook the =\r\nvoice of\ntheir inner self. a fish which comes out of water is such a distur=\r\nbing\nsite. Panting for water (i don&#39;t have proper English word to describe\n=\r\nthe condition of a fish out of water). and then the dead fish thus is so\nta=\r\nsty.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I understand and appreciate you feelin=\r\ngs, but I personally do not\nshare them. Call me cruel hearted.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When the question of sensitivity comes in, there is no universal\nsta=\r\nndard for such. It is moslty a case of conditioning. What one feels\ndisgust=\r\ned or pained about may not affect another. Same rule cannot be\nused to judg=\r\ne everyone.=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some of my non-vegetarian friends were=\r\n watching discovery channel\nwhere they showed that people in some parts of =\r\nthe world eat insects. My\nfriends seemed disgusted. I asked them, &quot;Why?&quot;. I=\r\nf you can eat a chicken\nor a fish, what is wrong=C3=82 if someone eats an i=\r\nnsect. Just because\none is born in a certain area in a certain culture in a=\r\n certain set of\nvalue, one gets the believe that what one is not accustomed=\r\n to must be\nincorrect. I told them if in a future life time they were to be=\r\n born in\nthat place, they would gladly keep eating insects without the slig=\r\nhtest\ndoubt in their mind. We humans are incorrigible product of our own\nco=\r\nnditions which in my opinion is all right. BUT the problem happens\nwhen we =\r\nthink our conditions are the only possible conditioning in the\nworld, and t=\r\nherefore we wonder why don&#39;t others share similar ideas.\nThat is incorrect.=\r\n Nature has created the world diverse, and so it is.\nEverything is desh-kaa=\r\nl-patra. A person who is a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vegetarian in this life, if he gets born i=\r\nn a place/culture/\nfamily in a later lifetime which=C3=82 eats non-vegetari=\r\nan food, he\nwould not even bat an eye lid while eating the same. I know=C3=\r\n=82 people\nwho faint at the sight of blood, but there are doctors who do mu=\r\nltiple\noperations daily. So my point is, personal sensitivity can be a very=\r\n\ngood reason for an individual, but it=C3=82 cannot be=C3=82 a universal\nlo=\r\ngic applicable to all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A far better angle of tackling th=\r\nis is the idea of karma. Even\nthen, if someone can make sure he is not dire=\r\nctly killing an animal, not\nselecting a live animal to be killed, but rathe=\r\nr buys dead\nmeat/fish/egg, the karma generated can be handled easily. Furth=\r\ner, if\nsomeone (a non-vegetarian)=C3=82 does not want to deal in the raw fl=\r\nesh,\nhe can buy some cooked non-vegetarian food. The amount of karma that y=\r\nou\nwould get for it is quite acceptble IMO. It can be easily handled.=C3=82=\r\n\nIt is similar to the one you would get for buying some simple daal which\nh=\r\nas come to the market through the hands of a middle man who has cheated\nthe=\r\n farmer, or God knows what else. There is karmic repurcussions in all\nfood =\r\nwe eat in this age. It is unavoidable. There are some eggs -\nbroiler eggs -=\r\n which never hatch into eggs. They are designed to be\neaten because they ne=\r\nver grow into an animal. Alsmot like dead from\nbirth. What karma does one g=\r\net for consuming that? God knows.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; An average non-vegetar=\r\nian, at least in India, to be precise is\nactually an omnivorous. His staple=\r\n diet consists of 80 percent\nvegetables/pulses etc and 20 percent non-veg. =\r\nFrom a scientific point of\nview, this is a good combination. People who fee=\r\nd on more than 60\npercent non-veg food in their staple diet, are prone to s=\r\nerious heath\nissues at a younger age.

Karama, Desh/kaal etc... does not appeal me. to be v=\r\nery honest. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In my opinon, if one can justify eating popular m=\r\neat of chicken, etc.. then anything under the Sun is eatable. with that log=\r\nic, those people who choose to eat Crab, Snakes, insects, cocroaches are pe=\r\nrfectly alright. even people who have started eating human flesh are also a=\r\ncceptable and not doing anything wrong as per the &#39;their&#39; thinking.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; To talk about Karma, Conditioning, Culture etc..., and try to make qu=\r\nality judgements by the logic of &#39;Direct killing&#39; and &#39;eating meat of alrea=\r\ndy dead&#39; does not go well with me. it is just a philosophy to cover up.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; Poeple born in Those cultures have become Vegetarian becuase they=\r\n hate killing invloved. I gave an example of one such person and there are =\r\nfew more i know. howvever they are very very very rare.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ***&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The above arguments are incorrect.

My point is, a=\r\ns a non-vegetarian I am not claiming that I have any special sensitivity to=\r\n plants, over animals. No. All I am saying is that,=C3=82 this logic that m=\r\nany vegetarian people provide to convince average non-veg people to quit ea=\r\nting non-veg, does not hold good.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; I personally can not look at butchery shops where one finds hanging goat=\r\ns. its pathetic site. People in their excitements stand in queue to see the=\r\n cutting of throat of a chicken and then take away that as parcel. The flas=\r\nh of so cruelly butchered Chicken or a Goat or a cow or pig, is so tasty fo=\r\nr the humans that they just overlook the voice of their inner self. a fish =\r\nwhich comes out of water is such a disturbing site. Panting for water (i do=\r\nn&#39;t have proper English word to describe the condition of a fish out of wat=\r\ner). and then the dead fish thus is so tasty.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I understand and appreciate you fe=\r\nelings, but I personally do not share them. Call me cruel hearted. &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; When the question of sensitivity comes=\r\n in, there is no universal standard for such. It is moslty a case of condit=\r\nioning. What one feels disgusted or pained about may not affect another. Sa=\r\nme rule cannot be used to judge everyone.=C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Some of my non-vegetarian friends were watching discovery=\r\n channel where they showed that people in some parts of the world eat insec=\r\nts. My friends seemed disgusted. I asked them, &quot;Why?&quot;. If you can eat a chi=\r\ncken or a fish, what is wrong=C3=82 if someone eats an insect. Just because=\r\n one is born in a certain area in a certain culture in a certain set of val=\r\nue, one gets the believe that what one is not accustomed to must be incorre=\r\nct. I told them if in a future life time they were to be born in that place=\r\n, they would gladly keep eating insects without the slightest doubt in thei=\r\nr mind. We humans are incorrigible product of our own conditions which in m=\r\ny opinion is all right. BUT the problem happens when we think our condition=\r\ns are the only possible conditioning in the world, and therefore we wonder =\r\nwhy don&#39;t others share similar ideas. That is incorrect. Nature has created=\r\n the world diverse, and so it is. Everything is desh-kaal-patra. A person w=\r\nho is a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; vegetarian in this life, if he gets born in a pla=\r\nce/culture/ family in a later lifetime which=C3=82 eats non-vegetarian food=\r\n, he would not even bat an eye lid while eating the same. I know=C3=82 peop=\r\nle who faint at the sight of blood, but there are doctors who do multiple o=\r\nperations daily. So my point is, personal sensitivity can be a very good re=\r\nason for an individual, but it=C3=82 cannot be=C3=82 a universal logic appl=\r\nicable to all.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; A far better ang=\r\nle of tackling this is the idea of karma. Even then, if someone can make su=\r\nre he is not directly killing an animal, not selecting a live animal to be =\r\nkilled, but rather buys dead meat/fish/egg, the karma generated can be hand=\r\nled easily. Further, if someone (a non-vegetarian)=C3=82 does not want to d=\r\neal in the raw flesh, he can buy some cooked non-vegetarian food. The amoun=\r\nt of karma that you would get for it is quite acceptble IMO. It can be easi=\r\nly handled.=C3=82 It is similar to the one you would get for buying some si=\r\nmple daal which has come to the market through the hands of a middle man wh=\r\no has cheated the farmer, or God knows what else. There is karmic repurcuss=\r\nions in all food we eat in this age. It is unavoidable. There are some eggs=\r\n - broiler eggs - which never hatch into eggs. They are designed to be eate=\r\nn because they never grow into an animal. Alsmot like dead from birth. What=\r\n karma does one get for consuming that? God knows.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; An average non-vegetarian, at least in India, to be pre=\r\ncise is actually an omnivorous. His staple diet consists of 80 percent vege=\r\ntables/pulses etc and 20 percent non-veg. From a scientific point of view, =\r\nthis is a good combination. People who feed on more than 60 percent non-veg=\r\n food in their staple diet, are prone to serious heath issues at a younger =\r\nage. But this 80-20 veg/non-veg, is biologically good.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 If we don&#39;t eat =\r\nfish then sea will be full of fishes:), Earth will be full of chickens:0, V=\r\neg food will become unaffordable if everybody will become vegetarian :Etc..=\r\n.are more often than not, put up such arguments to defend however as i said=\r\n earlier they are themselves not convinced.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The above arguments are incorrect.
