Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; The nature of mind is to wa=\r\nnder and think various things. Mind will\nstop thinking only when it is in s=\r\namadhi. Until then, it will continue\nto get some good thoughts and some bad=\r\n thoughts. That is its nature.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The goal of sadhana is to train the mi=\r\nnd to focus on one thing. Some\nmay train the mind to focus on a mantra. Som=\r\ne may train the mind to\nfocus on musical notes. Some may train the mind to =\r\nfocus on the\nbreathing. In various types of spiritual sadhana, you have one=\r\n object\nfor the mind to focus on. Still, mind tries to wander off all the t=\r\nime.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If a computer is running a program and a virus or spyware or adw=\r\nare\nstarts running, an anti-virus program&#39;s watchdog task that is running\ni=\r\nn the same computer detects it and deletes it (before it does much\nharm). S=\r\nimilarly, install a watchdog task in your mind. Suppose you\nare meditating =\r\nor doing some sadhana and trying to focus the mind on\nsomething. Suppose so=\r\nme other (good or bad!) thoughts come to the\nmind. As soon as you are aware=\r\n of it (i.e. the watchdog task detects\nthem), simply delete the thoughts.\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; I recommend not getting aggravated or frustrated at the bad\nthoughts. =\r\nJust become aware of them and tell yourself to focus on the\nmantra. It is *=\r\nnatural* for the mind to be thinking of those bad\nthoughts. By being aggrav=\r\nated or frustrated, you are only increasing\nthe distraction. It is like pic=\r\nking fight with a heckler who\ninterrupts a speech you are giving or a song =\r\nyou are singing. Become\naware and move on. If you pick a fight with the hec=\r\nkler it does more\nharm than the original heckling!\n&gt;  \n&gt; By being aware of =\r\nthe distraction, acknowledging it and then\nconsciously trying to ignore it,=\r\n you are maximizing your chances of\nsuccessfully returning the full attenti=\r\non of the mind to the mantra.\nOf course, the distraction will keep coming a=\r\ngain and again. But the\nbest option is to tell your mind to focus on the ma=\r\nntra each time you\nare aware of the distraction. Do NOT get frustrated. As =\r\nyou keep doing\nthis over and over and over, the heckler may decide to shut =\r\nup.\nSimilarly, as you ignore distractions of the mind, eventually oneday a\n=\r\npleasant accident will happen and mind will achieve absolute focus on\nthe m=\r\nantra, with no other thoughts! THAT is when you experience the\nmantra and d=\r\neity. Until then, it is a rehearsal.\n&gt;  \n&gt; All thoughts - good or bad - are=\r\n distractions. When you are\nmeditating with a mantra, the mind should be fo=\r\ncused on ONE thing.\nThat one thing can be the sound of the mantra or an ima=\r\nge of the deity\nyou have in your mind or a thought that &quot;so and so deity is=\r\n supreme. I\nam an insignificant servant&quot; etc. Try to focus your mind on tha=\r\nt one\nfocus point. As other thoughts come, become aware and move on without=\r\n\nany frustration or sadness or anger or disappointment.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Original mail=\r\n said: &quot;In my heart I definetly do not want them to\nmaterialize.&quot;. Please r=\r\nealize that one&#39;s thinking or not thinking of\nsomething has nothing to do w=\r\nith something happening or not happening.\nThinking that you make several th=\r\nings happen, that there is a\ncause-effect relationship between various thin=\r\ngs in the universe and\nyou have a role in it is an unnecessary burden. Tell=\r\n yourself that She\n(or He) does it all and you are just an insignificant se=\r\nrvant who\nhappens to be there observing it all. It is a simpler world view =\r\nand\none that does not burden you.
