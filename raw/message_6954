However, I have some questions and comments. \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; 1. While I have no doubt about your point that castes are portable and =\r\nnot determined by birth is a very valid one and hard to argue about, exampl=\r\ne of Vishwamitra is a far better one than that of Valmiki! The reason being=\r\n, as Sri Chaganti Koteshwara Rao, an eminent scholar in his 42 day Ramayana=\r\n Pravachanam says, Valmiki is not a tribal by birth but he is Son of Prache=\r\ntana, a brahmin of Bharadwajasa Gotra and his name was Agni Sarma! How he b=\r\necame a hunter and eventually became a great sage is a different story but =\r\nI believed that he=C2=A0was not a sudra by birth, based on his lectures. \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; 2. Also he goes on to say that his Disciple Bharadwaja is not=\r\n the same as the Bharadwaja of Saptarishi set! Agni Sarma himself (Valmiki&#39;=\r\ns original name) is of Bharadwajasa Gotra, according to him! It is quite po=\r\nssible that even in olden days, different people shared the same name! I wo=\r\nuld like to hear your views on this. \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I am completely in agr=\r\neement that homam is a very powerful sadhana and ever since I started doing=\r\n it daily ( from the last fifteen days), I can see that my confidence in ha=\r\nndling everything has increased manifold! I am just doing Ganapathi homam a=\r\nlong with Sandhya vandanam and I find this practise a pretty beautiful one.=\r\n But I am not able to control my anger at all! I am very short tempered per=\r\nson and cannot tolerate delays and keep yelling at my kids and wife a lot! =\r\nI am not seeing that homam is helping me there, but I just enjoy the ritual=\r\n itself and keep thinking that my clarity is increasing because of this. I =\r\nhad quite a few material setbacks but keep thing that my bad karma is getti=\r\nng burnt and never doubted the positive effects of homam for a minute! Plea=\r\nse let me know if my thinking is right!\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Nagraj\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n --- On Thu, 7/21/11, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: N=\r\narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] RE: Non Brahmin,Complet=\r\ned 108 Ganapathi Homams --Dont you think this is Guru Krupa?\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-=\r\nwisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, July 21, 2011, 2:01 PM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Srinivas,\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I am =\r\nglad you are doing homam and overcame drinking, smoking etc. It is very ins=\r\npiring and can inspire others too to overcome weaknesses.

Valmiki must&#39;ve been a great brahmin in previous lives, but s=\r\nome karmas made him take birth as a shoodra and eventually his original sam=\r\nskaras took over and he became a brahmin, a rishi and a maharshi. He even t=\r\naught brahma jnana to Bharadwaja, one of the saptarshis!\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Sim=\r\nilarly, if one is drawn to fire, does homam over a period of time and overc=\r\nomes some weaknesses, obviously strong samskaras are present from previous =\r\nlives. If they are allowed to dominate, one will make progress. One becomes=\r\n a true brahmana with sadhana. As one realizes true knowledge internally, o=\r\nne may even become worthy of teaching spiritual knowledge to others, includ=\r\ning brahmanas by birth!\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Not =\r\nonly non-brahmins from India, but people not born in India/Hinduism are doi=\r\nng homam regularly. Some of them are (will be) making great progess too. As=\r\n a result, a strong Brahmin (true!) class will be established across the wo=\r\nrld and that will increase dharma on earth.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Just yesterday n=\r\night, one Russian origin CS professor from Canada who was in Boston as a vi=\r\nsiting scholar at MIT came to my house and learned homam. He did Ganapathi =\r\nhomam at my house with my help and plans to do it in Canada. He has Jupiter=\r\n in Pisces in 12th house and I got a nice feeling when he was doing homam. =\r\nThere were also several good omens, making me think he is relatively well-p=\r\nrepared for sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; A dirty golden vessel is more valuable =\r\nthan a brightly shining copper vessel that is gold-plated! You just need to=\r\n clean the former..\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; This homam=\r\n movement is in nascent stages yet. Once a critical mass of sadhakas accumu=\r\nlates and people start making progress, it will spread like a wildfire. The=\r\nre is no hurry and there is need to feel pressure, for these things happen =\r\ndue to the will of higher beings. We are all merely instruments.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; I tend to think that there are blessings of some great saints/yogis be=\r\nhind this. When we did Shata Chandi homam at Chennai in March 2006, we casu=\r\nally selected a muhurta for the sankalpa of the week-long ritual, so that m=\r\naha-poornahuti happens on an Ashtami day. It was during this week that Mani=\r\nsh received a command from the divine Mother to spread homam. When I and Ma=\r\nnish took the sankalpa at the temple on the first day, it was Ramakrishna P=\r\naramahamsa&#39;s lunar birthday and it was within 5 min from the exact time whe=\r\nn the angle between Sun and Moon matched that at his birth. When I started =\r\ndaily homam about 5-6 months later, as a precursor to publishing the manual=\r\ns a few months later, there was another coincidence. It was exactly 120 lun=\r\nar years since Ramakrishna left his physical body. Moreover, I had a vision=\r\n of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa a day before Manish had the vision of divine Mo=\r\nther, during that week of Shata Chandi at the Kali temple in Chennai. I\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n  am not attached to forms and I rarely get visions.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Several=\r\n months before that, in late 2005, I had an interesting dream that actually=\r\n felt real (i.e. not like a dream). In the dream, there was a strong and pl=\r\neasant naad (buzz) that used to accompany my Kundalini rises through sushum=\r\nna during those days. It was dark and there was a huge fire. I was sitting =\r\nin front of the fire. A person with a powerful persona, whom I had never se=\r\nen before, sat in front of me. He was teaching me some yoga involving fire =\r\nand what yoga means etc. He taught several things in Sanskrit. Suddenly he =\r\nchanged into Manish. Then shakti came down, naad stopped, &quot;dream&quot; ended, an=\r\nd I was aware of my body lying on bed. The face of the person I saw was viv=\r\nid in my mind. I did not know who it was. I mentioned this dream to Manish =\r\na week or two later. He said he did not know who it was, but asked me a wee=\r\nk later to check out the photo of a specific yogi. When I did a search on t=\r\nhe internet, I found a photo (apparently the only photo\n&gt; &gt;  available of t=\r\nhat yogi). It looked very close to what I saw in my dream, except that the =\r\nperson in my dream seemed like a slightly younger version of that photo. Th=\r\nis was a famous yogi from the parampara of Mahavatar Babaji. As I had never=\r\n seen his photo before that or read much about that lineage or their teachi=\r\nngs, his coming in my dream was strange. Also, teaching me some yoga involv=\r\ning fire was strange, because homam movement did not start then and I was n=\r\not thinking of fire or fire ritual at all.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; There are some si=\r\ngns like this, which make me think that we are being used as instruments in=\r\n a big &quot;project&quot; designed by some great yogis in higher realms. It seems to=\r\n me like this project has an important purpose and will help MANY people in=\r\n their quest for god, in the coming decades and centuries.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; B=\r\nest regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Less=\r\nons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam =\r\nand Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAstrolo=\r\nger.org\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a difference: http://S=\r\naraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: http://groups.=\r\nyahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.yah=\r\noo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; On Thu, Jul 21, 2011 at 4:=\r\n42 AM, srinivas wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0 Hi: \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am a non Brahm=\r\nin, fortunately I came across Homam manuals/videos in internet.
