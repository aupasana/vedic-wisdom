This is a loaded question, \nbut I will share a few random thoughts on this and several related \ntopics. More than how to recognize spiritual progress, I will be writing \non how NOT to try to recognize it!\n\nIf you don&#39;t like my 2 cents, kindly feel free to ignore me and follow \nyour gurus and others whom you may prefer.\n\n*        *        *\n\nMATERIAL RESULTS\n\nOne obvious thing is that some people get material benefits, like \nmarriage, job, promotion, childbirth etc. That reinforces or increases \nfaith in the initial stages and makes one continue sadhana.\n\nHowever, that may not happen to everyone. Moreover, such material \nresults do not necessarily show spiritual progress. So, how do we \nidentify spiritual progress?\n\n*        *        *\n\nGOAL OF SADHANA\n\nSpiritual progress is an internal thing. It is well characterized in \nscriptures. Though different scriptures may use different words, it all \nboils down to one thing. What binds us is our likes, dislikes, \nattachments and agendas, which come from innate conditioning of the \nmind. How free we are is indicated by how much we are able to resist and \novercome this innate conditioning.\n\nMaharshi Vasishtha taught Lord Rama in &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; that \nSelf-realization means overcoming conditioning. Patanjali defined Yoga \n(Communion with Self) in &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; as &quot;yogaH chitta vRtti nirodhaH&quot; \n(Communion is resisting the working of conditioning).\n\nThis conditioning inflates ego and by overcoming all the conditioning, \nwe can deflate the ego completely and then identify with the entire \nuniverse, instead of a single entity with a single agenda.\n\n*        *        *\n\nIDENTIFYING CONDITIONING\n\nInnate conditioning of the mind, as said before, is what determines our \nlikes, dislikes, attachments and agendas. We tend to like (or dislike) \nsome people for no clear reason, we tend to do (or avoid) some things \nthough our inner voice (conscience) tells us not to do (or to do) those \nthings. All this comes from conditioning, which has been accumulated \nover many lives.\n\nWhen someone praises us, we may know that it is irrelevant (our inner \nvoice tells us so) and yet we may feel elated. When someone puts us \ndown, we may know that it is irrelevant (our inner voice tells us so) \nand yet we may feel offended and feel like doing something about it. All \nthis comes from conditioning, which has been accumulated over many \nlives.\n\nIdnetifying the conditioning as it works on our instincts, thoughts, \ncalculations and actions, is not easy. But it is not impossible. The key \nis to learn to listen to the inner voice of conscience. Whenever the \ninner voice of conscience is telling us one thing and we are impelled \nfrom inside to do otherwise, we can conclude that that is the work of \nconditioning. We often suppress the inner voice of conscience and obey \nthe inner voice of our conditioning.\n\nIf we are engaging in fewer and/or smaller actions - physical or mental \n- that go against the inner voice of conscience, it means our \nconditioning is becoming lighter. THAT is the only meaningful measure of \nspiritual progress. This may in general be difficult for others to \njudge, but one can certainly judge for oneself.\n\nThe tricky thing is that our self-analysis and self-judgment is also \ncontrolled by our conditioning!! Suppose I engaged in an action against \nmy inner voice. Suppose I want to analyze what just happened and whether \nI violated my inner voice of conscience. That whole process is governed \nby the conditioning too. Depending on how deeply I am conditioned to \nthink that I am a good person doing the right thing and not making a \nmistake, my mind will be impelled to label the inner voice of conscience \nas a voice of confusion and not accord it any importance. Instead, it \nwill focus on the inner voice of conditioning (which shouts out from \ninside the reasons that justify the action!) and conclude that I did the \nright thing.\n\nThe grip of conditioning is too tight to overcome in a day or two! But, \nthe inner voice of conscience does tell everyone when one is doing \nsomething wrong under the influence of conditioning. If one keeps \ntrying, it can oneday help one identify and overcome conditioning.\n\n*        *        *\n\nSPECIAL EXPERIENCES\n\nSometimes, as one makes spiritual progress, one may have super-normal or \nmystical or out-of-body experiences, visions and dreams.\n\nFor example, one person I know started to feel very light in the head \nwith a vision of bright light of a particular color, when he meditated \nwith a specific mantra. Another person felt like there was a big fire at \nthe base of his spine and the entire lower back was on fire (he actually \nfelt unbearably hot), when he meditated with a specific mantra. Another \nperson saw a deity appear in front of him and the deity talked to him. \nInterestingly, the same deity was seen by another person who was also \nsitting there at the same time and that person had a totally different \n(and more mundane) mental conversation with the same deity at the same \ntime. Another person felt like he became very light and was floating in \nair and there was an inexpressible happiness. In another case, one \nsadhaka when meditating was filled with the sense that his job was done \non earth and he could now leave. He thought, &quot;let me leave and let me \ntake some more with me&quot;. He felt like he was a point moving up with a \ntremendous speed. At the same time, another person who was meditating a \nfew feet away in front of a homam fire felt like somebody was pulling \nthat person forcibly through a cave and felt really overwhelmed.\n\nThere are so many possible experiences. But the key point is that \nexperiences are secondary. They are NEITHER NECESSARY NOR SUFFICIENT for \nspiritual progress. I had my share of experiences, progress and setbacks \nand I am 100% sure of the above. You&#39;ll do well to remember this \nsentence and not be swayed by stories of experiences or desire them \nconsciously or sub-consciously. I will elabate a little later on the \ngrave dangers of desiring experiences.\n\n*        *        *\n\nEXPERIENCE VS THEORY: WRONG QUESTION\n\nWe say that god can be known only by experience and not by reading \nbooks. That is not incorrect. However, when one is deeply desirous of an \nexperience, one may experience an aspect of god&#39;s Delusory Power instead \nof god and that may increase false pride (a true experience of god will \ninstead produce infinite humility). Not all experiences are equal.\n\nThere is a famous quote: An ounce of experience is better than a ton of \ntheory. Though that is true in a way, it is not complete. Even a ton of \nexperience is useless if produces a quintal of ego. Instead, a ton of \ntheory may actually be better if it actually reduces one&#39;s ego to a \npound or an ounce!\n\nThe issue is not whether one needs practical experience or theoretical \nunderstanding. That is secondary. The primary thing is what is happening \nto one&#39;s ego. Is it getting inflated or deflated? THAT is undoubtedly \nthe main issue. If reading books, satsanga, rituals, theoretical \nunderstanding etc reduce ego from a ton to a quintal, from a quintal to \na pound and from a pound to an ounce, even without a direct experience, \nthat&#39;s awesome. That is better than getting a ton of experience and ego \nbeing inflated from a pound to a quintal.\n\nThough it is true that ego does not become complete zero without an \n&quot;experience&quot; of god in the end, it is still a bad idea to seek that \n&quot;experience&quot; when one&#39;s ego is still a ton or a quintal. First reduce it \nto as small a quantity as you can. Experience of god will then come by \nitself.\n\nIn the famous Indian movie &quot;3 Idiots&quot;, there is a nice line: &quot;Don&#39;t \nchase success, but chase capability. Success will follow automatically.&quot; \nSimilarly, don&#39;t chase experiences, but chase detachment and deflation \nof ego. Experience will automatically follow. Chasing experience without \ntrying to reduce ego is like putting the cart before the horse. To use \nthe analogy from the movie &quot;3 Idiots&quot;, one then runs the risk of \nbecoming the spiritual equivalent of Chatur Ramalingam (alias Silencer) \nof that movie, who chased success, ended up with huge ego from limited \nsuccess and failed in the end!\n\n*        *        *\n\nEXPERIENCE AND CONDITIONING\n\nAs said above, it is a bad idea to seek an &quot;experience&quot; when one&#39;s ego \nis still a ton or a quintal. In other words, when one&#39;s conditioning is \ndense enough, a pre-occupation with experiences can be \ncounter-productive. The reason is that any experience will be \ninterpreted (and absorbed into one&#39;s system!!!) through the color of \none&#39;s conditioning.\n\nIf I go into the open and view Sun without any eyeglasses, I will see \nthat Sun is orange. But, suppose I see Sun from green colored glass \nwindows of a house. Or suppose I go into the open, but see Sun through \ngreen eyeglasses. In either case, I will see that Sun is green. I am \nexperiencing the real Sun, but I will get the wrong knowledge that &quot;Sun \nis green&quot;.\n\nSimilarly, even a genuine spiritual experience (e.g. seeing Sun!) CAN \ngenerate false knowledge (e.g. Sun is green!) if one&#39;s conditioning is \nconducive (e.g. green eyeglasses!).\n\nThe key is not just to experience, but the ability to interpet, *digest* \nand absorb the experience into one&#39;s system well. One&#39;s conditioning \ninfluences how one digests various life experiences, including spiritual \nexperiences and mystical experiences, like the green eye glasses in the \nabove example!\n\n*        *        *\n\nDIGESTION OF EXPERIENCES\n\nIn ayurvedic terms, food one cannot digest well becomes ama, a toxic \nbuildup in the system. It can slowly build up, get absorbed into various \ntissues and create various diseases. In the beginning, one may look and \nfeel healthy despite some ama, but, when too much ama accumulates, one \ndevelops serious diseases. The disease starts to spread to various parts \nof the body. The ama may even interfere with the digestion of good food \nbeing taken in and the working of even medicines one may take in. When \ntoo much ama has accumulated and destabilizes the system, one may need \nto go through a painful de-toxification process.\n\nSimilarly, spiritual experiences one cannot digest well become spiritual \nama, a toxic buildup in the subtle system. It can slowly build up, get \nabsorbed into various aspects of one&#39;s being and create various diseases \nin the subtle system. In the beginning, one may look and feel \nspiritually healthy despite such issues, but, when too much spiritual \nama accumulates, one develops serious spirituality disorders. It can \neventually affect one&#39;s entire being. The spiritual pancha-karma (for \nde-toxification) may be far more difficult than the physical \npancha-karma.\n\n*        *        *\n\nEXPERIENCES OR DELUSIONS\n\nTo illustrate what I mean by spiritual ama and delusions, let me give a \n*hypothetical* example.\n\nSuppose someone sits still for a few hours everyday and meditates. \nSuppose one starts to get some special inner experiences and some \nseemingly supernatural things start happening externally around one. \nSuppose these experiences give one the impression that one is special \nand one is making excellent spiritual progress. Suppose one reads some \nspiritual books and fantasizes &quot;becoming like Shiva&quot; mentioned in those \nbooks. Then one may start to think &quot;may be, I have become like Shiva&quot; \nand slowly convince oneself that one HAS become like Shiva. Suppose one \nreads a spiritual book that claims &quot;If one becomes like Shiva, the whole \nuniverse connives against one who causes an offense to him&quot;.\n\nOf course, there is a context behind every statement and no statement is \nabsolute. If one misses the nuances, one may digest and absorb it into \none&#39;s system incorrectly. After all, one could have also said, &quot;if one \nbecomes like Shiva, the whole universe fully co-operates with one and \nthere is no way anyone can really cause offense to that person&quot;.\n\nAnyway, one in the process of convincing oneself that one has indeed \nbecome like Shiva may then look for examples of someone causing offense \nand suffering bad things. Of course, just as one can find any shapes in \nclouds, one can find any correlations in things happening around one. \nOne will find a few examples. That may reinforce the delusion that one \nhas become like Shiva. When good and bad happen to people around one, \none may start correlating them to good and bad done by those people to \none and/or to things one has done. Over time, the delusion may become so \ndeep that it just feels so natural and obvious. This is like a serious \ndisease developing from a toxic buildup of undigested or badly digested \nfood. Inability to fully understand the spiritual experiences one had, \nthe fantasy of becoming like Shiva, the pre-exising pride (like \npre-existing ama) and the not-so-well-digested notion that offense to \nShiva causes harm, have together created spiritual ama buildup that now \nresulted in a serious disease.\n\nThough original experiences may have been genuine, experiences coming \nlater on MAY be the result of accumulated delusions (disease) from the \nill-digested experiences and notions (ama). Please note that ama is \nconducive to creating more ama. When unchecked, disease in one part of \nthe system can spread to others.\n\nAs said before, the key issue is: Is the ego getting inflated or \ndeflated. If ego is getting inflated, then one is on the wrong track. \nOne is either deluding oneself or ill-digesting genuine experiences due \nto pre-existing conditioning and delusions (spiritual ama). In either \ncase, whatever one is experiencing is not being digested well and is \nweakening the system instead of strengthening it. If, on the other hand, \nego is getting deflated, then one is on the right track. Whatever one is \nexperiencing is being digested well and strengthening the system.\n\n*        *        *\n\nSHAKTI, SIDDHIS AND MIRACLES\n\nThis emphasis on ego deflation may make some people wonder about the \nprominence given in some books to accumulation of shakti, siddhis and \nmiracles. For example, some books describe what a being like Shiva or \nsomeone less but still with high enough shakti, can do.\n\nYes, SOME enlightened beings or some beings close to enlightenment MAY \nhave a lot of spiritual shakti and be able to do some special things. \nBut, no book said that you get those abilities by being proud or \npursuing something that can make one proud.\n\nIn fact, if one looks at those abilities described in books and adores \nthem from one&#39;s *current* levels of dense conditioning, it is quite akin \nto looking at a &quot;green Sun&quot; from green eyeglasses and admiring the \ngreenness of that Sun!!! In other words, one has missed the whole point. \nOne with dense conditioning can&#39;t even understand what that shakti or \nability really means or comes from. In order to understand what shakti \nis, to accumulate enough shakti or to reach such a state, one MUST \ndeflate one&#39;s ego.\n\nBottomline is this: Most scriptures of most religions are unanimous in \nteaching the importance of humility, compassion and ego deflation. No \nscripture talks about the glory of pride and ego inflation. It&#39;s as \nsimple as that.\n\n*        *        *\n\nGODS, GODDESSES, VISIONS & CONVERSATIONS\n\nWe encounter some people who claim to have visions of gods and goddesses \nand also conversations with them. When probed, there is nothing sublime \ncoming from the divine beings in their encounters. Whatever the divine \nbeings supposedly said is well within what one consciously or \nsub-consciously already knew or believed or wanted to believe.\n\nThis may remind one of the encounters of Mahatma Gandhi by the character \nplayed by Sanjay Dutt in hit bollywood movie &quot;Lage Rahe Munnabhai&quot;. In \nthat movie, the visions are due to &quot;chemical imbalance&quot; in Munnabhai&#39;s \nmind and the Gandhi he sees and can talk to, cannot answer questions \nthat Munnabhai himself does not know (but real Gandhi should know). So \nthe conclusion is that the person Munnabhai imagines seeing is a \ncharacter in his own mind constructed based on what Munnabhai \nunderstands of Gandhi.\n\nIn the case of divine encounters, it may be a little different from this \nmovie. It MAY be a divine being one truly fancied meeting based on all \nthat one consciously and sub-consciously knew already, OR it may be a \nreal being. Even in the latter case, the being and his/her actions are \ninterpreted strictly based on one&#39;s conditioning, like the &quot;green Sun&quot; \nin our previous example. So, no wonder, in most cases, what divine \nbeings say fits well within the realm of knowledge one consciously or \nsub-consciously already knew or believed or wanted to believe.\n\nIn the rare case of a sadhaka with very little conditioning having a \nreal divine encounter, it is like an innocent child meeting mother or \nfather, and there is a real flow of divine and sublime understanding and \nwisdom.\n\nAgain, the key is not to see a god or a goddess, but to be \nde-conditioned enough to really benefit from it!\n\n*        *        *\n\nKUNDALINI AWAKENING & RISE\n\nOne more thing people often talk about is Kundalini awakening and rise. \nKundalini shakti is that through which we are aware of self (i.e. this \nis &quot;I&quot;). Kundalini being asleep in Mooladhara chakra means one does not \neven question who one is and assumes the normal self-awareness that ties \nself down to the physical body and physical senses. However, \nself-awareness rising above this does not necessarily mean spiritual \nprogress or enlightenment. Kundalini awakening is only the beginning of \na long process. If one&#39;s conditioning is deeply holding down to subtle \nideas of who one is (e.g. I am a great spiritual soul who saved the \nworld many times in the past and came back to save it), an awakened \nKundalini may take one&#39;s notion of self beyond the physical body, but \nwill get stuck somewhere else. In fact, one&#39;s subtle notions of self may \nbecome aggrandized when Kundalini reaches conducive regions and one may \nexperience things that aggravate and strengthen those notions. One may \nget badly stuck.\n\nAs mentioned above, any spiritual experience can create spiritual ama \nwhen not digested properly. Any pre-existing conditioning may make it \ndifficult to digest anything complex. Instead of eating a heavy-duty \nprotein bar that one cannot digest and getting toxic buildup in the \nsystem, one is better off eating simple food that one&#39;s own system can \nprocess and digest well.\n\nTo be clear, whether one&#39;s Kundalini is awakened or not, and where one&#39;s \nKundalini is currently, is NOT a measure of one&#39;s spiritual progress. As \nKundalini does not rise through a single path, as the rise is not linear \nand as the obstructions are not uniform in all people, one cannot \ncompare two people based on Kundalini experiences.\n\nOne can cling to the body and overcome all conditioning slowly and \noneday Kundalini may awaken and rise all the way to Sahasrara. Another \nperson may awaken Kundalini and it may get stuck somewhere where it is \nextremely difficult to overcome the corresponding conditioning.\n\nThe bottomline is that how much conditioning is overcome and how reduced \none&#39;s ego is is the correct measure of spiritual progress and not \nwhether Kundalini is awakened and where Kundalini is.\n\n*        *        *\n\nCORRELATIONS GALORE\n\nDo not get distracted by trying to find *correlations* that may or may \nnot mean much. Suppose you call someone and they tell you, &quot;wow, I was \njust thinking about you&quot;. Or suppose you say something and someone says, \n&quot;wow, I was just thinking about it. You answered me as though you read \nmy mind.&quot; Suppose you were unhappy with the happenings in some region of \nthe world, did a special sadhana and suppose something bad happened \nthere. Or suppose you had a desire at the back of your mind, did some \nsadhana and the desire was fulfilled.\n\nIn several such cases, correlating a result with something you did can \noften increase pride and your sense of self-worth. And, doing that will \nnot enable you to do your dharma any better.\n\nKeep thinking your thoughts and desires, keep doing your actions and \nkeep doing your sadhana. That&#39;s it. Don&#39;t correlate actions and results \nand think that you made X or Y result happen. We engage in actions and \ngod gives results. The sense of &quot;I made X happen&quot; is conducive to pride \nand ego inflation. Moreover, you can *never* know *for sure* whether \naction A or B caused result X or Y, because the action-result pipeline \nhas variable delay!! So, why even bother to correlate and run the risk \nof ego inflation?\n\n*        *        *\n\nBOTTOMLINE\n\nDon&#39;t run after special experiences and special abilities or anything \nthat makes you special (as you imagine currently, based on your dense \nconditioning). Spiritual progress is not about becoming &quot;special&quot;, but \nabout becoming humble. Special experiences and abilities do not matter \nat all. In fact, they can distract one and give false pride. God makes \none special AFTER one sheds pride completely or almost completely.\n\nAlso, stop correlating things happening to or around you, with your \nactions, and think that you caused events X or Y. Engaging in actions is \nyour sacred duty and giving whatever results are fit at a given time is \ngod&#39;s prerogative. That is the simplest and safest model one can imbibe \nin one&#39;s thinking.\n\nRemember the absolute bottomline: The only meaningful measure of \nspiritual progress is how deflated your ego is and how humble you become \n(not how humble you act or behave, but how humble you have really become \ninternally). It is how well you are able to resist the temptations of \nfollowing the voice of your conditioning (which inflates ego) and how \nwell you can follow the voice of conscience.\n\nWhen inflations in ego occur, it is the job of a guru/mentor to notice \nit, bring it to the attention and perhaps even be ruthless in belling \nthe cat [of ego]. But most gurus now-a-days may not do that well. So, \nyou have to do your best to avoid any serious ego inflations.\n\nUnfortunately, the path of spiritual progress and self-realization IS \nvery very very likely for most of us to include many many many \nopportunities for very very very serious ego inflation! So keep a strict \nwatch on your ego.\n\n*        *        *\n\nIf I offended anybody with some strong assertions in this email, my \napologies.\n\nOm Tat Sat.\n\nKrishnarapanamstu,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}}
