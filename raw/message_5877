Ramachandra Iyer whose native home is Tiruvannamalai itself, has\nbe=\r\nen an earnest devotee of Sri Bhagavan from very early times.

This was th=\r\ne only house\nwhich Sri Bhagavan entered to take biksha in the usual way aft=\r\ner he had left\nhis Madurai home. This information was given in full detail =\r\nby Sri Maharshi\nhimself.\n\nThe present Ashram, almost from its inception has=\r\n grown and developed to his\nknowledge and he has been actively associated w=\r\nith every branch of its\ngrowth, while maintaining close contact with Sri Bh=\r\nagavan and depending on\nhim for guidance. Few\nhave had this privilege of mo=\r\nving with Sri Bhagavan for so many years with\nthe ease and freedom of a dev=\r\noted son to an affectionate parent.\n\nThis gave him ample opportunities of r=\r\neceiving instruction, and guidance\ndirectly or indirectly from Sri Bhagavan=\r\n. In later years, it also led to his\nbeing helpful in interpreting Sri Bhag=\r\navan&#39;s utterances to some of the\nwestern devotees and those who did not kno=\r\nw Tamil.\n\nTPR was also instrumental in seeing through the press a few editi=\r\nons of Sri\nBhagavan&#39;s early works, particularly the 3rd edition of =E2=80=\r\n=98Sri Ramana Nool\nTkirattu=E2=80=99 (=E2=80=98The Collected Works of Sri M=\r\naharshi=E2=80=99 in Tamil).\n\nWhen Sri Bhagavan&#39;s fatal physical affliction =\r\nappeared for the first\ntime,ending in an operation, and then recurred, TPR =\r\nmade up his mind and\nwound up his practice and\ninterests in Madras.\n\nTherea=\r\nfter he was fortunate enough to join the small band of attendants who\nlooke=\r\nd after Sri Bhagavan&#39;s personal comforts and needs.
