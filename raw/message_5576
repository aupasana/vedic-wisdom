Kaala Bhairavaashtakam composed by Aadi Shankara at Kashi is particularly beautiful. A few mantras are contained in the Kaala Bhairava Homam manual (see homam site below).\n \nOf course, one can perform a homam to Kaala Bhairava also.\n \nThe best way to worship a deity, however, is to imbibe the qualities represented by that deity. All the 14 worlds and their inhabitants, including deities, live in one&#39;s body in microcosmic form (and, microcosm is identical to the macrocosm). Each deity is a personification of some qualities inside us. Different qualities endow us with different kinds of shakti (capability to get certain things done). If we increase certain qualities and build certain shakti, we are effectively making the corresponding deity manifest in us. THAT is the best way to worship any deity!\n \nIf one wants to worship Bhairava internally, one should develop a fearless, straight-forward and uncomplicated personality. Nothing should bind one - relations, job, position, power, belongings etc. One should want nothing and accept whatever comes to one naturally. One should not do something (or keep from doing something one feels like doing!) for fear of what others may think about one or will say. One should not care about one&#39;s image, one&#39;s status, one&#39;s belongings and one&#39;s position. Follow what seems like one&#39;s dharma with absolute fearlessness.\n \nIf one successfully imbibes various such qualities attributed to Bhairava and lives life like that, one&#39;s every action and thought and one&#39;s whole life will be a worship of Bhairava.\n \nSame thing can be said about other deities also. The best way to worship any deity is to imbibe the qualities attributed to that deity (not pretend outwardly, but be like that inwardly). Don&#39;t think that it is not possible. It is not only possible, but it is going to happen in the coming decades. Many sadhakas will demonstrate this in coming decades and that will help to strengthen the hold of Sanatana Dharma on the world. \n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- &quot;J.&quot; &lt;jkoperumcholan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Namaste Shri Narasimha,\n&gt;\n&gt; Which is the best way to perform worship to Lord Bhairava?\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; J.
