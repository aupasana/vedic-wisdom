The =\r\nmore this conscious process replaces his own effort, the more rapid and tru=\r\ne becomes his progress. But it cannot completely replace the necessity of p=\r\nersonal effort until the surrender and consecration are pure and complete f=\r\nrom top to bottom.\n\nNote that a tamasic surrender refusing to fulfil the co=\r\nnditions and calling on God to do everything and save one all the trouble a=\r\nnd struggle is a deception and does not lead to freedom and perfection.\n\nTo=\r\n walk through life armoured against all fear, peril and disaster, only two =\r\nthings are needed, two that go always together -- the Grace of the Divine M=\r\nother and on your side an inner state made up of faith, sincerity and surre=\r\nnder. Let your faith be pure, candid and perfect. An egoistic faith in the =\r\nmental and vital being tainted by ambition, pride, vanity, mental arrogance=\r\n, vital self-will, personal demand, desire for the petty satisfactions of t=\r\nhe lower nature is a low and smoke-obscured flame that cannot burn upwards =\r\nto heaven. Regard your life as given you only for the divine work and to he=\r\nlp in the divine manifestation. Desire nothing but the purity, force, light=\r\n, wideness, calm, ananda of the divine consciousness and its insistence to =\r\ntransform and perfect your mind, life and body. Ask for nothing but the div=\r\nine, spiritual and supramental Truth, its realisation on earth and in you a=\r\nnd in all who are called and chosen and the conditions needed for its creat=\r\nion and its victory over all opposing forces.\n\nLet your sincerity and surre=\r\nnder be genuine and entire. When you give yourself, give completely, withou=\r\nt demand, without condition, without reservation so that all in you shall b=\r\nelong to the Divine Mother and nothing be left to the ego or given to any o=\r\nther power.\n\nThe more complete your faith, sincerity and surrender, the mor=\r\ne will grace and protection be with you. And when the grace and protection =\r\nof the Divine Mother are with you, what is there that can touch you or whom=\r\n need you fear? A little of it even will carry you through all difficulties=\r\n, obstacles and dangers; surrounded by its full presence you can go securel=\r\ny on your way because it is hers, careless of all menace, unaffected by any=\r\n hostility however powerful, whether from this world or from worlds invisib=\r\nle. Its touch can turn difficulties into opportunities, failure into succes=\r\ns and weakness into unfaltering strength. For the grace of the Divine Mothe=\r\nr is the sanction of the Supreme and now or tomorrow its effect is sure, a =\r\nthing decreed, inevitable and irresistible.\n\nUntil you are capable of this =\r\ncomplete dynamic identification, you have to regard yourself as a soul and =\r\nbody created for her service, one who does all for her sake. Even if the id=\r\nea of the separate worker is strong in you and you feel that it is you who =\r\ndo the act, yet it must be done for her. All stress of egoistic choice, all=\r\n hankering after personal profit, all stipulation of self-regarding desire =\r\nmust be extirpated from the nature. There must be no demand for fruit and n=\r\no seeking for reward; the only fruit for you is the pleasure of the Divine =\r\nMother and the fulfilment of her work, your only reward a constant progress=\r\nion in divine consciousness and calm and strength and bliss. The joy of ser=\r\nvice and the joy of inner growth through works is the sufficient recompense=\r\n of the selfless worker.\n\nBut a time will come when you will feel more and =\r\nmore that you are the instrument and not the worker. For first by the force=\r\n of your devotion your contact with the Divine Mother will become so intima=\r\nte that at all times you will have only to concentrate and to put everythin=\r\ng into her hands to have her present guidance, her direct command or impuls=\r\ne, the sure indication of the thing to be done and the way to do it and the=\r\n result. And afterwards you will realise that the divine Shakti not only in=\r\nspires and guides, but initiates and carries out your works; all your movem=\r\nents are originated by her, all your powers are hers, mind, life and body a=\r\nre conscious and joyful instruments of her action, means for her play, moul=\r\nds for her manifestation in the physical universe. There can be no more hap=\r\npy condition than this union and dependence; for this step carries you back=\r\n beyond the border-line from the life of stress and suffering in the ignora=\r\nnce into the truth of your spiritual being, into its deep peace and its int=\r\nense Ananda.\n\nWhile this transformation is being done it is more than ever =\r\nnecessary to keep yourself free from all taint of the perversions of the eg=\r\no. Let no demand or insistence creep in to stain the purity of the self-giv=\r\ning and the sacrifice. There must be no attachment to the work or the resul=\r\nt, no laying down of conditions, no claim to possess the Power that should =\r\npossess you, no pride of the instrument, no vanity or arrogance. Nothing in=\r\n the mind or in the vital or physical parts should be suffered to distort t=\r\no its own use or seize for its own personal and separate satisfaction the g=\r\nreatness of the forces that are acting through you. Let your faith, your si=\r\nncerity, your purity of aspiration be absolute and pervasive of all the pla=\r\nnes and layers of the being; then every disturbing element and distorting i=\r\nnfluence will progressively fall away from your nature.\n\nThe last stage of =\r\nthis perfection will come when you are completely identified with the Divin=\r\ne Mother and feel yourself to be no longer another and separate being, inst=\r\nrument, servant or worker but truly a child and eternal portion of her cons=\r\nciousness and force. Always she will be in you and you in her; it will be y=\r\nour constant, simple and natural experience that all your thought and seein=\r\ng and action, your very breathing or moving come from her and are hers. You=\r\n will know and see and feel that you are a person and power formed by her o=\r\nut of herself, put out from her for the play and yet always safe in her, be=\r\ning of her being, consciousness of her consciousness, force of her force, a=\r\nnanda of her Ananda. When this condition is entire and her supramental ener=\r\ngies can freely move you, then you will be perfect in divine works; knowled=\r\nge, will, action will become sure, simple, luminous, spontaneous, flawless,=\r\n an outflow from the Supreme, a divine movement of the Eternal.&quot;\n\n\n- Sri Au=\r\nrobindo.\n\n\n"}}
