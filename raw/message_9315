That is the &quot;story&quot; or the=\r\n\n&gt; &quot;myth&quot; coming alive &quot;inside&quot; of &quot;you&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Difficult concept to put into=\r\n words, at least for me.\n&gt;\n&gt; Let us consider Ms DS for example, short for d=\r\nurga saptashati.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is a freaking long text!! at least for people who a=\r\nre initially\n&gt; starting out reciting it. But then this the path that is not=\r\n easy to\n&gt; begin with. And if it were easy, everybody would be very success=\r\nful with\n&gt; it, and not many are ( it all depends on her and your madness)\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; The main point with recitation is , that Ms DS comes &quot;alive&quot; &quot;inside&quot; of=\r\n\n&gt; &quot;you&quot;.\n&gt; The hell does that mean? It means that you visualize the chapte=\r\nrs as\n&gt; they are.\n&gt; It means that your focus or the mind is not with the se=\r\nxy girl you saw\n&gt; in the mall, the quickfire reply you should have given to=\r\n the turd that\n&gt; slightly insulted you, or what payments you have to collec=\r\nt tomorrow\n&gt; from the bank etc etc. And neither it should be somewhere sing=\r\ning songs\n&gt; and just waiting for this text (DS) to end.\n&gt;\n&gt; Believe you me =\r\n, Rakesh ji it is tough. Insanely tough to get the mind\n&gt; fixed or visualiz=\r\ning the fight and all the carnage/beauty that is there\n&gt; in DS. And what ai=\r\nds to the fun, is if you don&#39;t know sanskrit. Ha!!\n&gt;\n&gt; You may know how to =\r\nread the devanagri script, but dont really know what\n&gt; it means, then the r=\r\neal fun starts. So you are reciting a text, but\n&gt; can&#39;t really visualize it=\r\n because you just don&#39;t know what the hell it\n&gt; means or what are you readi=\r\nng!\n&gt;\n&gt; There is a solution to that, you will need to read, re-read and re-=\r\nread\n&gt; one chapter at a time and tie in the hindi translation or an\n&gt; inter=\r\npretation with the sanskrit text above. It will take time, an this\n&gt; is not=\r\n a one day process. It might take years or days , and varies on a\n&gt; case to=\r\n case basis.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think the video would have ended in the other tab by now=\r\n, you can play\n&gt; this now.\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DHReN67juhCg=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Let us take Chapter 10 for example,\n&gt; in the beginning fo the chapter,=\r\n once he sees that his brother is dead\n&gt; Gunda no 2 ( (Mr shumbh bhai) shou=\r\nts at madameji for cheating and\n&gt; relying on various other ladies for killi=\r\nng his brother in crime gunda\n&gt; no 1 ( Nishumbh bhai ) and cheating, and ma=\r\ndame-ji replies with aww,\n&gt; those all were actually me and merges all the f=\r\norms back and shows him.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now , when you get to the tenth chapter, this =\r\nvisualization should be\n&gt; there ,when you read the specific verses about th=\r\nis incident and not be\n&gt; thinking about oh my god when will this end I am t=\r\nired and mere paise us\n&gt; kutte harami ke paas pare hain aur woh nahin de ra=\r\nha hai.\n&gt;\n&gt; Over a period of time when you repeatedly visualize the entire =\r\nstory\n&gt; along with the reading, then will it one day come alive inside of y=\r\nou\n&gt; and teach you further, because there are layers upon layers upon layer=\r\ns\n&gt; of meaning there and it will be slowly taught very serenely depending o=\r\nn\n&gt; her wish and judgement.\n&gt;\n&gt; Video must have ended\n&gt; http://www.youtube.=\r\ncom/watch?v=3DKpGhw6bdmEQ\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;If one has to do 108 times sapatshati readin=\r\ng then can u pls guide what\n&gt; r rules in this time like &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; If you can ma=\r\nnage one good reading with a nice visualization going on,\n&gt; it will be much=\r\n better than 108 times of just rushing through with it.\n&gt;\n&gt; 1] diet ,\n&gt; You=\r\n will want to keep it as light as possible, khichri does the trick,\n&gt; you w=\r\nill need all the &quot;inner fire&quot; for your focus on the text and it is\n&gt; a limi=\r\nted resource, so the more heavier food you have the more it will\n&gt; be used =\r\nfor digestion and potty preparation.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2] can it be recited in 2 or 3 sit=\r\ntings in a day\n&gt; No problems in that, but decide the routine before you com=\r\nmitting to\n&gt; madame- she just does not like people backing off.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3] if f=\r\new words are not properly recited then is there any harm , if\n&gt; feelings r =\r\njust for mothers love with nishkam bhav\n&gt;\n&gt; Bhaisahab, kuch nahin hoga, you=\r\n are not worshipping a churail here,\n&gt; eventually ma hain, tumko kategi bhi=\r\n toh roegi bhi, pehle hi maafi maang\n&gt; lo. bum nahin phootega/phootegi.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Plus you are saying harm with nishkam bhav, not sure those two fit in\n&gt; th=\r\ne same sentence.\n&gt;\n&gt; 4] is 13 chap enough or any start addition is reqd if =\r\nso then pls\n&gt; suggest,\n&gt; Bhaiyo, 13 hi karlo theek thaak focus ke saath , g=\r\no to bigger things\n&gt; later.\n&gt;\n&gt; 5] any other advice\n&gt; You try to improve yo=\r\nur one reading and step by step get it to a point\n&gt; where the text is flowi=\r\nng inside of you and out, other wise 108 will be\n&gt; just a mental burden wit=\r\nh you trying to hurriedly complete, with you\n&gt; getting terribly bored while=\r\n youa re at it.. Don&#39;t expect any fruits\n&gt; post your 108 completion.\n&gt;\n&gt; 6]=\r\nalso as u said that it is essence of vedas but how can it give moksha\n&gt; as =\r\nwe r just reading but if one does recitation of one mantra with\n&gt; closed ey=\r\nes then is mantra better.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ooh the video must have ended, here another o=\r\nne\n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=3Dendscreen&NR=3D1&v=3DKEvKcdBfqt=\r\nU\n&gt;\n&gt; You make the entire text run inside of your head like a HD movie in\n&gt;=\r\n 1080p resolution and you will yourself say that it is the essence of the\n&gt;=\r\n vedas.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;but how can it give moksha as we r just reading&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;\n&gt; You =\r\ndont just have to read, hehe.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regarding, moksha, all i can say used to =\r\nbe the name of very pretty girl\n&gt; back in school, saali ki shaadi ho gayi, =\r\ngod-damn it!!\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyways if anyone expects any results , forget it. All sh=\r\ne will be doing\n&gt; is smoking a cigarette and yawning, if you just go throug=\r\nh it\n&gt; mindlessly.\n&gt;\n&gt; But it always start mindlessly and if you keep at it=\r\n, she eventually\n&gt; decides to teach you. So start today ,and make small imp=\r\nrovements every\n&gt; day.\n&gt;\n&gt; Its all training and the amount of hard work tha=\r\nt you put in, in any\n&gt; field of life, same here.\n&gt;\n&gt; One good reading of on=\r\nly 13 chapters takes about 1 hour 10 minutes or 20\n&gt; depending on your spee=\r\nd and if you are really comfortable it can go down\n&gt; to about an 55 to sixt=\r\ny minutes for one reading, that is if you have\n&gt; really been living with Ms=\r\n DS for years.\n&gt;\n&gt;

It might=\r\n take years or days , and varies on a&lt;br&gt;\ncase to case basis.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI th=\r\nink the video would have ended in the other tab by now, you can play&lt;br&gt;\nth=\r\nis now.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\r\n=3DHReN67juhCg&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DHReN67ju=\r\nhCg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLet us take Chapter 10 for example,&lt;br&gt;\nin the beginning f=\r\no the chapter, once he sees that his brother is dead&lt;br&gt;\nGunda no 2 ( (Mr s=\r\nhumbh bhai) shouts at madameji for cheating and&lt;br&gt;\nrelying on various othe=\r\nr ladies  for killing his brother in crime gunda&lt;br&gt;\nno 1 ( Nishumbh bhai )=\r\n and cheating, and madame-ji replies with aww,&lt;br&gt;\nthose all were actually =\r\nme and merges all the forms back and shows him.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nNow , when you get=\r\n to the tenth chapter, this visualization should be&lt;br&gt;\nthere ,when you rea=\r\nd the specific verses about this incident and not be&lt;br&gt;\nthinking about oh =\r\nmy god when will this end I am tired and mere paise us&lt;br&gt;\nkutte harami ke =\r\npaas pare hain aur woh nahin de raha hai.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOver a period of time wh=\r\nen you repeatedly visualize the entire story&lt;br&gt;\nalong with the reading, th=\r\nen will it one day come alive inside of you&lt;br&gt;\nand teach you further, beca=\r\nuse there are layers upon layers upon layers&lt;br&gt;\nof meaning there and it wi=\r\nll be slowly taught very serenely depending on&lt;br&gt;\nher wish and judgement.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nVideo must have ended&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.y=\r\noutube.com/watch?v=3DKpGhw6bdmEQ&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/=\r\nwatch?v=3DKpGhw6bdmEQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;If one has to do 108 times sapatsh=\r\nati reading then can u pls guide what&lt;br&gt;\nr rules in this time like &quot;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf you can manage one good reading with a nice visualization going=\r\n on,&lt;br&gt;\nit will be much better than 108 times of just rushing through with=\r\n it.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n1] diet ,&lt;br&gt;\nYou will want to keep it as light as possible, =\r\nkhichri does the trick,&lt;br&gt;\nyou will need all the &quot;inner fire&quot; fo=\r\nr your focus on the text and it is&lt;br&gt;\na limited resource, so the more heav=\r\nier food you have the more it will&lt;br&gt;\nbe used for digestion and potty prep=\r\naration.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n2] can it be recited in 2 or 3 sittings in a day&lt;br&gt;\nNo p=\r\nroblems in that, but decide the routine before you committing to&lt;br&gt;\nmadame=\r\n- she just does not like people backing off.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n3] if few words are n=\r\not properly recited then is there any harm , if&lt;br&gt;\nfeelings r just for mot=\r\nhers love with nishkam bhav&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBhaisahab, kuch nahin hoga, you are no=\r\nt worshipping a churail here,&lt;br&gt;\neventually ma hain, tumko kategi bhi toh =\r\nroegi bhi, pehle hi maafi maang&lt;br&gt;\nlo. bum nahin phootega/phootegi.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nPlus you are saying harm with nishkam bhav, not sure those two fit in&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nthe same sentence.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n4] is 13 chap enough or any start addition is=\r\n reqd if so then pls&lt;br&gt;\nsuggest,&lt;br&gt;\nBhaiyo, 13 hi karlo theek thaak focus=\r\n ke saath , go to bigger things&lt;br&gt;\nlater.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n5] any other advice&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nYou try to improve your one reading and step by step get it to a point&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nwhere the text is flowing inside of you and out, other wise 108 will be&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\njust a mental burden with you trying to hurriedly complete, with you&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\ngetting terribly bored while youa re at it..
