You have to complete the story. you have to=\r\n tell what happened when X went to meet this man in temple.or anything else=\r\n which happened. It is like somebody gone in kitchen to get rest of meal an=\r\nd not come back.\n\nFirst I have to thank you for writing that story about Di=\r\nvine Mother SriChinnmastaji. I had developed a fear about Her but 3 times I=\r\n got spiritual indications over the period of 2 months that I should write =\r\nmy story. When you wrote back suddenly my fear about Her melted away and I =\r\ndid immediate prayers to Her. Thanks.\n\nThe other thing is can I dare to say=\r\n that I do not agree what is in this thread. Why does this so called spirit=\r\nual man has to dump his failure on religion. If people do not believe in re=\r\nligion or God or afterlife, it is their problem. We are not all equal. We a=\r\nll do not come from same stock. We are born with different conditions, go t=\r\nhrough different life experiences and go where our fate or destiny takes us=\r\n. This world is composed of 3 gunas and there is always going to tension of=\r\n different sort. Why =C2=A0blame it on religion or God, why not on greed an=\r\nd desire to control others and lord over them using what ever mean.\n\nThis s=\r\ntory seems to like I used to read in Chandamama. This guy Iyengar seems to =\r\nbe a siddha if the story so far is true.and he has the ability to shape shi=\r\nft and transportation. So what?? But he still needs his daily fix of bhang.=\r\n\n\nwhat does God mean in this tale? Is it Creator God or Divine Lord Of SriV=\r\nrindavan or =C2=A0Divine Mother or =C2=A0Self Realisation or Universal God =\r\nor Jewish God or Formless God or Fire God?? After all there was a dhoni fir=\r\ne there? Or some other God ??\n\nSriVrindavan has a rolling population. They =\r\nare not in confusion. Many people come there only for curiosity, many other=\r\n come only for Darshan in the Temple and go back home happy. many others co=\r\nme with different desires. It is very wrong to expect from a person who is =\r\nin fifth grade to have knowledge of 15th grade.\n\nMany times people go to te=\r\nmple to pray and ask for certain things and if it does not happen they beco=\r\nme very anti religion and anti God. So what?? It has nothing to do with me =\r\nor you or anybody else. It is their life.\n\nI was very very very ill. Nobody=\r\n was helping me. Many people were giving me lot of pain. =C2=A0I went from =\r\nReligious place to religious place, temple to temple, holy man to holy man.=\r\n Nothing seem to worked. Then I took up religious practise of doing mantra =\r\njapa and other things which are in scriptures and Grace of Divine Mother it=\r\n worked. It is totally religious discipline according to our scriptures.\n\nD=\r\no you drive a car? Did you pass you exam first time? I do not drive a car. =\r\nIt will take me several exams to pass it. Many people pass their test first=\r\n time and drive successfully. Does it mean I should blame car or exams or e=\r\nxaminer or road for my failure??? .Many people take up spiritual life and i=\r\nf they do not find success quickly they blame religion and God.\n\nI also use=\r\nd to think that a real experience of God would be very powerful thing. but =\r\nthere are other aspects to it. If someone is totally dependent on Divine Mo=\r\nther and calls on Her day and night, but yet he is not ready for certain en=\r\nergy or his body is not clean enough to receive a new light, then Divine Mo=\r\nther would appear to him in very gentle way to comfort him and to console s=\r\no that he remains on the path. She will appear right in front of him but he=\r\n only sees the Golden Aura and not what is middle of it because he is not y=\r\net ready. Whenever I think of that moment I am filled with deep bliss and j=\r\noy and wonderment.\n\nYou are a special person doing everyday intense haven t=\r\no spread the light.Many other people in this group are doing haven everyday=\r\n to fill their life with light of Divine Beings. This is a complete religio=\r\nus method which is also totally spiritual thing.Please do not get impressed=\r\n with pseudo spiritual talk and tales of shape shifting. Is everything alri=\r\nght in your everyday life because I felt a sadness in your mail? I am sure =\r\nI am very wrong in this.\n\nFew days ago Olympic flame passed right outside m=\r\ny road.I did not go out to see it. I kept holding to the Light which comes =\r\nout of Divine Mothers Feet hoping it will become permanent in my life.\n\nGoo=\r\nd Luck and =C2=A0Joy for you.\nLaxmiNarayan\n\n\n\n_____________________________=\r\n___\n From: rajarshinandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \nSent: Monday, 23 July 2012, 11:04=\r\n\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] To those who say that they don=E2=80=99t belie=\r\nve in any religion\n \n\n \n\n\n\nDear Ajit,\n\nI am in complete agreement with your=\r\n thoughts.=C2=A0 A spiritual man once said, &quot;Religion has been created to s=\r\nhield people from God&quot;.=C2=A0\n\nWhen I first heard this I was not convinced =\r\nand thought it was some fake secularism. Lately I realized this is literall=\r\ny true. Heavy psychological constructs are created by religions to protect =\r\nan average person from the real experience of God, which is so powerful and=\r\n overwhelming that if and when it happens, it can effectively cause a hurri=\r\ncane in your average life and pretty much destroy all your well laid plans.=\r\n\n\n\nI will briefly narrate a true and interesting incident. \n\n\nAn individual=\r\n - say X - had gone to Vrindavan to stay there for some years. He was sitti=\r\nng at a satsang of a famous sadhu, enjoying the discourse, when a ragged lo=\r\noking man, with piercing unblinking eyes, comes over and asks for food. The=\r\n sadhu who was lecturing at the satsang, stopped and ordered someone to bri=\r\nng some sweets for the ragged looking man. Then he did a pranam to the man =\r\nand said, &quot;Maharaj, please tell us some words of God&quot;. The man became angry=\r\n, and retorted back, &quot;Why? Why waste time talking of God, no one wants God =\r\nanyway. If God comes, all will run away. So please continue with your lectu=\r\nres as you were doing before I came in&quot;. Everyone became uncomfortably sile=\r\nnt hearing this. Meanwhile the sweets came, the man took a sweet into his m=\r\nouth, looked up at the sky and then got up and started walking off. After h=\r\ne went out, the Sadhu who was lecturing, looked at his followers and said, =\r\n&quot;He is a sadhu who comes to Vrindavan once in a while,\n but he has probably=\r\n lost his mental balance due to smoking too much ganja&quot;. Now X, who was sit=\r\nting there, for some weird reason felt attracted to that ragged man and wen=\r\nt out to see where the guy was going. As he approached the ragged looking m=\r\nan, the man turned around and spoke to X in clear English, &quot;Hello, I was wa=\r\niting for you to come and join me.&quot; X was of course taken aback, did not ex=\r\npect the man to speak in English and more over he had no clue how the man g=\r\not to know that he knew English (X was dressed in the garb of a sadhu - saf=\r\nfron clothes). \n\n\nThe man continued, &quot;My name is Mr Iyengar. I was born nea=\r\nr Chennai, was an Engineer by profession, but left home long back and have =\r\nbeen a wondering sadhu since then.&quot; X asked him, why did you derive the sad=\r\nhu who was doing the satsang? Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;All this is bogus. Actua=\r\nlly this God thing itself is source of all confusion. No one has a clue. No=\r\nt the hordes of Sadhus, not ordinary folks, really no one. And God is the r=\r\neason for all the religious troubles and other nonsense.&quot; X felt a little i=\r\nrritated, &quot;Why do you have so much bitterness about religion/God/sadhus etc=\r\n? If you have been a sadhu for long, then how come you haven&#39;t met a single=\r\n genuine sadhu yet, how is it possible?&quot;. Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;Well if I ta=\r\nke Vrindavan alone, there is only one genuine man here, rest are all as con=\r\nfused as anybody else, merely different degrees of confusion. But you canno=\r\nt meet that man, he is not accessible to others.&quot; Mr Iyengar continued, &quot;Th=\r\ne root of\n all this problem is this God business. Know it for certain, that=\r\n man cannot know God ever. What is infinite is beyond the capacity of the h=\r\numan brain to comprehend. At best a man will only imagine a magnified man o=\r\nr a magnified woman with super-powers. If the individual keeps doing sadhan=\r\na, one day he will create this form by a projection of his own mind, and he=\r\n may even acquire supernatural abilities from this form, and generally be r=\r\negarded by others as a man of god. But God is beyond this. That is why I sa=\r\ny the root of the problem is trying to understand the infinite with a finit=\r\ne mind and then stressing that one has understood correctly.&quot; While talking=\r\n, the sadhu stopped at a small tea-stall and bought some ganja, and in one =\r\npull finished off the chillum. Then held the smoke in a kumbaka for about 5=\r\n minutes, slowly releasing the smoke in small bits. Then he continued, &quot;You=\r\n (meaning X) are a young man. Have a clear mind in your head, don&#39;t get\n co=\r\nnfused by all these show of spirituality you see in holy places. When I was=\r\n your age, I did a lot of terrible mistakes in the impetuousness of youth. =\r\nI was an infamous young man in the locality of Chennai where I grew up. But=\r\n then one day having nothing better to do, I left home. After roaming for 3=\r\n decades, I slowly realized what God really is and how to interact with thi=\r\ns thing.&quot; As he spoke he reached a two storied house, and a man, woman and =\r\na young girl came out of the house. They invited him inside and Mr Iyengari=\r\nnturn said to X, you too come inside, these people love me a lot so when I =\r\ncome to Vrindavan I stay at their house. I will show you something interest=\r\ning if you join me.\n\n\nAfter an hour inside the house, X was feeling very bo=\r\nred and irritated. The woman was bringing different fruits and sweets for t=\r\nheir food while the young girl was massaging Mr Iyengar&#39;s feet as he lay do=\r\nwn on a cot, enjoying the hospitality. X thought this man is one more fraud=\r\n, he abuses everyone else but has no qualms about shamelessly accepting the=\r\n hospitality of a householder and enjoying a good life. As soon as this tho=\r\nught crossed his mind, he saw that the man and the woman and the girl=C2=A0=\r\n stood up and with folded hands were bowing down towards the cot where Mr I=\r\nyengar was lying down. X was sitting on the floor, facing the opp direction=\r\n to the cot. He too turned round to see what was going on. What he saw made=\r\n his jaw drop open in shock. Instead of the old, bald, ragged beggar that w=\r\nas Mr Iyengar, there sat on the cot a young man, who looked in his early tw=\r\nenties, whose whole skin was dazzlingly fair, emanating a brilliant glow th=\r\nat lightened up the\n whole room. He had a shaved head, four arms, holding l=\r\notus and weapons, with enchantingly beautiful eyes! It looked not a human b=\r\neing any more but a god sitting in place of what was even five minutes back=\r\n only a frail, dirty-looking Mr Iyengar.\n\n\nX did not know what was happenin=\r\ng. He saw the young man gestured towards him to stand up and come near the =\r\ncot. Like being hypnotized, X got up and walked upto the cot and the young =\r\nman embraced him and X lost all consciousness. When he woke up, he saw he w=\r\nas near a temple, in a remote location with trees and shrubs all around. Ol=\r\nd Mr Iyengar was nearby, held his hand and took him inside the temple preci=\r\nncts. There he saw a dhuni burning, and next to it an old man, naked, sitti=\r\nng in meditation with ash all over his body. Mr Iyengar did not say a word,=\r\n pointed out that meditating man to him and then took X out of the temple. =\r\nThat is the man I was talking about, he said. You should meet him tomorrow.=\r\n He is the only one in Vrindavan currently who has an idea what God really =\r\nmeans. After providing directions of how to reach that desolate temple, Mr =\r\nIyengar hugged X again and immediately he felt he was losing awareness of p=\r\nlace/time and lapsed into\n unconsciousness again. \n\n\nWhen X woke up, he was=\r\n in the room in that house, lying on the floor. Mr Iyengar was on the bed, =\r\nhis old, ragged self, with a mischievous smile on his face. Next day, X wen=\r\nt to the temple as directed. \n\n\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n=C2=A0\nawaktamwyak=\r\ntimApannammanyantEmAmabuddhayah |\nparambhAwamajAnantomamAwyayamanuttamam ||=\r\n[7:24]\n\n\n________________________________\n From: AjitKrishnan &lt;ajit.krishna=\r\nn@...&gt;\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \nSent: Monday, 23 July 2012 8=\r\n:13 AM\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] To those who say that they don=E2=80=99t=\r\n believe in any religion\n \n\n=C2=A0 \nDear Prasanth,\n\n&gt; To those who say that=\r\n they don=E2=80=99t believe in any religion\n\n\n\n\nIn general, many of those w=\r\nho don&#39;t believe in religion or God are being more honest than those who do=\r\n. After all, most people who believe in God look at him as a limited being =\r\nto barter with. All of our biases and assumptions are most apparent when de=\r\naling with our Gods. Often, religion has simply served to formalize these b=\r\niases.\n\nWhile being mired in this word of duality, we think that an ounce o=\r\nf insincere prayer can undo the whole weight of &quot;paapa&quot; that we engage in t=\r\nhroughout the day. And we lay this bias on our God. No wonder that others l=\r\nook at all the suffering in the world and laugh at this concept of God. We =\r\n&quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit.\n\nWe all have plenty of paapa and punya in =\r\nour karmic pipeline. Instead of asking for the strength to be steadfast whi=\r\nle we reap both kinds of fruits, we ask God to burn &quot;paapa&quot; and leave the &quot;=\r\npunya&quot; intact. It is us &quot;God believers&quot; who look at our lives, ignoring all=\r\n the &quot;paapaphala&quot;. We look at one or two instances of &quot;punyaphala&quot; and decl=\r\nare our prayers to be successful. However, an impartial observer sees it fo=\r\nr what it is, and laughs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit.\n\nFor th=\r\ne most part, our bhakti is weak. When we are engaged in spiritual practices=\r\n, our bhakti is particularly weak, and we count the seconds and minutes. Wh=\r\nen engaged in worldly pursuits, our bhakti is strong, and time really flies=\r\n. And yet, we expect God to reward our weak spiritual bhakti and ignore our=\r\n strong worldly bhakti. An impartial observer sees it for what it is, and l=\r\naughs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit.\n\nThe best way to bring abo=\r\nut new waves of bhakti is not to look at the &quot;non-believers&quot; and try to con=\r\nvert them. All we have to do is try to eliminate our lack of belief, and be=\r\n honest with ourselves. If we can transform ourselves, the world will be se=\r\nrved.\n\nIf we see God as the limitless power that he is, he is difficult to =\r\ndefine. It is difficult to capture him within a religion. Religion should s=\r\nee itself as a stepping-stone, and should ask each of us to _eventually_ pl=\r\nace our feet on top of it to reach the higher goals. Unfortunately, most re=\r\nligions ask us to accept them without question. They ask us to place our he=\r\nads on them with reverence, and try to prevent the spiritually advanced fro=\r\nm going any farther.\n\nsasneham,\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0 =C2=A0ajit\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\r\n---1133388179-1136976526-1343484031=:56484\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ar=\r\nial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dear Rajarshi Bhai,&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;How are you?

Is it=\r\n Creator God or Divine Lord Of Sri Vrindavan or &nbsp;Divine\n Mother or &nb=\r\nsp;Self &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-12&quot; class=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Realisation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;=\r\n or Universal God or Jewish God or Formless God or Fire God?? After all the=\r\nre was a dhoni fire there? Or some other God ??&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sri Vrindavan has a rolling population. They are no=\r\nt in confusion. Many people come there only for curiosity, many other come =\r\nonly for Darshan in the Temple and go back home happy. many others come wit=\r\nh different desires. It is very wrong to expect from a person who is in fif=\r\nth grade to have knowledge of 15th grade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Many times people go to temple to pray and ask for certain thin=\r\ngs and if it does not happen they become very anti religion and anti God. S=\r\no what?? It has nothing to do with me or you or anybody else. It is their l=\r\nife.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I was very very very ill. Nobody was helping =\r\nme. Many people were giving me lot of pain. &nbsp;I went\n from Religious pl=\r\nace to religious place, temple to temple, holy man to holy man. Nothing see=\r\nm to worked. Then I took up religious &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-18&quot; class=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan&gt;practise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of doing mantra japa and other things which are=\r\n in scriptures and Grace of Divine Mother it worked. It is totally religiou=\r\ns &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-20&quot; class=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;discipline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; accord=\r\ning to our scriptures.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Do you drive a car? Did you=\r\n pass you exam first time? I do not drive a car. It will take me several ex=\r\nams to pass it. Many people pass their test first time and drive successful=\r\nly. Does it mean I should blame car or exams or examiner or road for my fai=\r\nlure??? .Many people take up spiritual life and if they do not find success=\r\n quickly they blame religion and God.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I also used =\r\nto think that a real experience of God would be very powerful thing. but th=\r\nere are other aspects to it. If someone is totally\n dependent on Divine Mot=\r\nher and calls on Her day and night, but yet he is not ready for certain ene=\r\nrgy or his body is not clean enough to receive a new light, then Divine Mot=\r\nher would appear to him in very gentle way to comfort him and to console so=\r\n that he remains on the path. She will appear right in front of him but he =\r\nonly sees the Golden Aura and not what is middle of it because he is not ye=\r\nt ready. Whenever I think of that moment I am filled with deep bliss and jo=\r\ny and wonderment.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You are a special person doing e=\r\nveryday intense haven to spread the light.Many other people in this group a=\r\nre doing haven everyday to fill their life with light of Divine Beings. Thi=\r\ns is a complete religious method which is also totally spiritual thing.Plea=\r\nse do not get impressed with pseudo spiritual talk and tales of shape shift=\r\ning. Is everything alright in your everyday life because I felt a sadness i=\r\nn your mail? I am sure I am very wrong in\n this.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;F=\r\new days ago Olympic flame passed right outside my road.I did not go out to =\r\nsee it. I kept holding to the Light which comes out of Divine Mothers Feet =\r\nhoping it will become permanent in my life.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Good L=\r\nuck and &nbsp;Joy for you.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;LaxmiNarayan&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-s=\r\nize: 10pt; &quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, tim=\r\nes, serif; font-size: 12pt; &quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;A=\r\nrial&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/=\r\nb&gt; rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font=\r\n-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wis=\r\ndom@yahoogroups.com&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Monday, 23 July 2012, 11:04&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bol=\r\nd;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] To those who\n say that they don=\r\n=E2=80=99t believe in any religion&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv186=\r\n4014975&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;\n&lt;!--\n\n#yiv1864014975  \n#yiv1864014=\r\n975 .yiv1864014975ygrp-photo-title{\nclear:both;font-size:smaller;height:15p=\r\nx;overflow:hidden;text-align:center;width:75px;}\n#yiv1864014975 div.yiv1864=\r\n014975ygrp-photo{\nbackground-position:center;background-repeat:no-repeat;ba=\r\nckground-color:white;border:1px solid black;height:62px;width:62px;}\n\n#yiv1=\r\n864014975 div.yiv1864014975photo-title \n         a, \n#yiv1864014975 div.yiv=\r\n1864014975photo-title a:active, \n#yiv1864014975 div.yiv1864014975photo-titl=\r\ne a:hover, \n#yiv1864014975 div.yiv1864014975photo-title a:visited {\ntext-de=\r\ncoration:none;\n}\n\n#yiv1864014975 div.yiv1864014975attach-table div.yiv18640=\r\n14975attach-row {\nclear:both;}\n\n#yiv1864014975 div.yiv1864014975attach-tabl=\r\ne div.yiv1864014975attach-row div {\nfloat:left;}\n\n#yiv1864014975 p {\nclear:=\r\nboth;padding:15px 0 3px 0;overflow:hidden;}\n\n#yiv1864014975 div.yiv18640149=\r\n75ygrp-file {\nwidth:30px;}\n#yiv1864014975 div.yiv1864014975attach-table div=\r\n.yiv1864014975attach-row div div a {\ntext-decoration:none;}\n\n#yiv1864014975=\r\n div.yiv1864014975attach-table div.yiv1864014975attach-row div div span {\nf=\r\nont-weight:normal;}\n\n#yiv1864014975 div.yiv1864014975ygrp-file-title {\nfont=\r\n-weight:bold;}\n#yiv1864014975  \n--&gt;\n&lt;/style&gt;\n        \n&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); =\r\nfont-family: verdana, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; &quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;=\r\nDear Ajit,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;I am in compl=\r\nete agreement with your thoughts.&nbsp; A spiritual man once said, &quot;Religio=\r\nn has been created to shield people from God&quot;.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When I first heard this I was not convinced and thought it was so=\r\nme fake secularism. Lately I realized this is literally true. Heavy psychol=\r\nogical constructs are created by religions to protect an average person fro=\r\nm the real experience of God, which is so powerful and overwhelming that if=\r\n and when it happens, it can effectively cause a hurricane in your average =\r\nlife and pretty much destroy all your well laid plans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;div&gt;I will briefly narrate a true and interesting incident. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;An individual - say X - had gone to Vrindavan to\n stay =\r\nthere for some\n years. He was sitting at a satsang of a famous sadhu, enjoy=\r\ning the discourse, when a ragged looking man, with piercing unblinking eyes=\r\n, comes over and asks for food. The sadhu who was lecturing at the satsang,=\r\n stopped and ordered someone to bring some sweets for the ragged looking ma=\r\nn. Then he did a pranam to the man and said, &quot;Maharaj, please tell us some =\r\nwords of God&quot;. The man became angry, and retorted back, &quot;Why? Why waste tim=\r\ne talking of God, no one wants God anyway. If God comes, all will run away.=\r\n So please continue with your lectures as you were doing before I came in&quot;.=\r\n Everyone became uncomfortably silent hearing this. Meanwhile the sweets ca=\r\nme, the man took a sweet into his mouth, looked up at the sky and then got =\r\nup and started walking off. After he went out, the Sadhu who was lecturing,=\r\n looked at his followers and said, &quot;He is a sadhu who comes to Vrindavan on=\r\nce in a while, but he has probably lost his mental balance due to smoking t=\r\noo much\n ganja&quot;. Now X, who was sitting there, for some weird reason felt a=\r\nttracted to that ragged man and went out to see where the guy was going. As=\r\n he approached the ragged looking man, the man turned around and spoke to X=\r\n in clear English, &quot;Hello, I was waiting for you to come and join me.&quot; X wa=\r\ns of course taken aback, did not expect the man to speak in English and mor=\r\ne over he had no clue how the man got to know that he knew English (X was d=\r\nressed in the garb of a sadhu - saffron clothes). &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;The man continued, &quot;My name is Mr Iyengar. I was born near Chennai, wa=\r\ns an Engineer by profession, but left home long back and have been a wonder=\r\ning sadhu since then.&quot; X asked him, why did you derive the sadhu who was do=\r\ning the satsang? Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;All this is bogus. Actually this God =\r\nthing itself is source of all confusion. No one has a clue. Not the hordes =\r\nof Sadhus, not ordinary folks, really no one. And God is the reason for all=\r\n\n the religious troubles and other nonsense.&quot; X felt a little irritated, &quot;W=\r\nhy do you have so much bitterness about religion/God/sadhus etc? If you hav=\r\ne been a sadhu for long, then how come you haven&#39;t met a single genuine sad=\r\nhu yet, how is it possible?&quot;. Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;Well if I take Vrindavan=\r\n alone, there is only one genuine man here, rest are all as confused as any=\r\nbody else, merely different degrees of confusion. But you cannot meet that =\r\nman, he is not accessible to others.&quot; Mr Iyengar continued, &quot;The root of al=\r\nl this problem is this God business. Know it for certain, that man cannot k=\r\nnow God ever. What is infinite is beyond the capacity of the human brain to=\r\n comprehend. At best a man will only imagine a magnified man or a magnified=\r\n woman with super-powers. If the individual keeps doing sadhana, one day he=\r\n will create this form by a projection of his own mind, and he may even acq=\r\nuire supernatural abilities from this form, and generally be regarded\n by o=\r\nthers as a man of god. But God is beyond this. That is why I say the root o=\r\nf the problem is trying to understand the infinite with a finite mind and t=\r\nhen stressing that one has understood correctly.&quot; While talking, the sadhu =\r\nstopped at a small tea-stall and bought some ganja, and in one pull finishe=\r\nd off the chillum. Then held the smoke in a kumbaka for about 5 minutes, sl=\r\nowly releasing the smoke in small bits. Then he continued, &quot;You (meaning X)=\r\n are a young man. Have a clear mind in your head, don&#39;t get confused by all=\r\n these show of spirituality you see in holy places. When I was your age, I =\r\ndid a lot of terrible mistakes in the impetuousness of youth. I was an infa=\r\nmous young man in the locality of Chennai where I grew up. But then one day=\r\n having nothing better to do, I left home. After roaming for 3 decades, I s=\r\nlowly realized what God really is and how to interact with this thing.&quot; As =\r\nhe spoke he reached a two storied house, and a man, woman and a\n young girl=\r\n came out of the house. They invited him inside and Mr Iyengar inturn said =\r\nto X, you too come inside, these people love me a lot so when I come to Vri=\r\nndavan I stay at their house. I will show you something interesting if you =\r\njoin me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After an hour inside the house, X was=\r\n feeling very bored and irritated. The woman was bringing different fruits =\r\nand sweets for their food while the young girl was massaging Mr Iyengar&#39;s f=\r\neet as he lay down on a cot, enjoying the hospitality. X thought this man i=\r\ns one more fraud, he abuses everyone else but has no qualms about shameless=\r\nly accepting the hospitality of a householder and enjoying a good life. As =\r\nsoon as this thought crossed his mind, he saw that the man and the woman an=\r\nd the girl&nbsp; stood up and with folded hands were bowing down towards th=\r\ne cot where Mr Iyengar was lying down. X was sitting on the floor, facing t=\r\nhe opp direction to the cot. He too turned round to see\n what was going on.=\r\n What he saw made his jaw drop open in shock. Instead of the old, bald, rag=\r\nged beggar that was Mr Iyengar, there sat on the cot a young man, who looke=\r\nd in his early twenties, whose whole skin was dazzlingly fair, emanating a =\r\nbrilliant glow that lightened up the whole room. He had a shaved head, four=\r\n arms, holding lotus and weapons, with enchantingly beautiful eyes! It look=\r\ned not a human being any more but a god sitting in place of what was even f=\r\nive minutes back only a frail, dirty-looking Mr Iyengar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;X did not know what was happening. He saw the young man gestured=\r\n towards him to stand up and come near the cot. Like being hypnotized, X go=\r\nt up and walked upto the cot and the young man embraced him and X lost all =\r\nconsciousness. When he woke up, he saw he was near a temple, in a remote lo=\r\ncation with trees and shrubs all around. Old Mr Iyengar was nearby, held hi=\r\ns hand and took him inside the temple precincts.\n There he saw a dhuni burn=\r\ning, and next to it an old man, naked, sitting in meditation with ash all o=\r\nver his body. Mr Iyengar did not say a word, pointed out that meditating ma=\r\nn to him and then took X out of the temple. That is the man I was talking a=\r\nbout, he said. You should meet him tomorrow. He is the only one in Vrindava=\r\nn currently who has an idea what God really means. After providing directio=\r\nns of how to reach that desolate temple, Mr Iyengar hugged X again and imme=\r\ndiately he felt he was losing awareness of place/time and lapsed into uncon=\r\nsciousness again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When X woke up, he was in t=\r\nhe room in that house, lying on the floor. Mr Iyengar was on the bed, his o=\r\nld, ragged self, with a mischievous smile on his face. Next day, X went to =\r\nthe temple as directed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Regards&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;div\n class=3D&quot;yiv1864014975MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yiv186401=\r\n4975yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249950&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;=\r\nnew york&#39;, times, serif; &quot;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yiv1864014975yui_3_2_0_2_134243506227946 yiv186=\r\n4014975yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249952 yiv1864014975yui_3_2_0_18_13430238163808=\r\n2&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size: 10pt; color: navy; font-family: Verdana; &quot;&gt;&lt;font col=\r\nor=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mam=\r\nAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;=\r\n font-size: 10pt; &quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new yor=\r\nk&#39;, times, serif; font-size: 12pt; &quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial=\r\n&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;br&gt; &lt;b=\r\n&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Monday, 23 July 2012\n 8=\r\n:13 AM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [ve=\r\ndic-wisdom] To those who say that they don=E2=80=99t believe in any religio=\r\nn&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1864014975&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;spa=\r\nn style=3D&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1864014975ygrp=\r\n-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div&gt;Dear Prasanth,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&g=\r\nt; To those who say that they don=E2=80=99t believe in any religion&lt;br&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In general, many of those who don&#39;t bel=\r\nieve in religion or God are being more honest than those who do. After all,=\r\n most people who believe in God look at him as a limited being to barter wi=\r\nth. All of our biases and assumptions are most apparent when dealing with o=\r\nur Gods. Often, religion has simply served to formalize these biases.&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;While being mired in this word of duality, we think t=\r\nhat an ounce of insincere prayer can undo the whole weight of &quot;paapa&quot; that =\r\nwe engage in throughout the day. And we lay this bias on our God. No wonder=\r\n that others look at all the suffering in the world and laugh at this conce=\r\npt of God. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;W=\r\ne all have plenty of paapa and punya in our karmic pipeline. Instead of ask=\r\ning for the strength to be steadfast while we reap both kinds of fruits, we=\r\n ask God to burn &quot;paapa&quot; and leave the &quot;punya&quot; intact. It is us &quot;God believ=\r\ners&quot; who look at our lives, ignoring all the &quot;paapa phala&quot;. We look at one =\r\nor two instances of &quot;punya phala&quot; and declare our prayers to be successful.=\r\n However, an impartial observer sees it for what it is, and laughs at us. W=\r\ne &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For the most =\r\npart, our bhakti is weak. When we are engaged in spiritual practices, our b=\r\nhakti is particularly weak, and we count the seconds and minutes. When enga=\r\nged in worldly pursuits, our bhakti is strong, and time really flies. And y=\r\net, we expect God to reward our weak spiritual bhakti and ignore our strong=\r\n worldly bhakti. An impartial observer sees it for what it is, and laughs a=\r\nt us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The be=\r\nst way to bring about new waves of bhakti is not to look at the &quot;non-believ=\r\ners&quot; and try to convert them. All we have to do is try to eliminate our lac=\r\nk of belief, and be honest with ourselves. If we can transform ourselves, t=\r\nhe world will be served.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If we see God as the li=\r\nmitless power that he is, he is difficult to define. It is difficult to cap=\r\nture him within a religion. Religion should see itself as a stepping-stone,=\r\n and should ask each of us to _eventually_ place our feet on top of it to r=\r\neach the higher goals. Unfortunately, most religions ask us to accept them =\r\nwithout question.
