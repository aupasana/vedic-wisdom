I certain=\r\nly cannot claim to have established this Purusha consciousness perfectly wi=\r\nthin myself. I am therefore not doing a &#39;true&#39; purascharana in the way you =\r\ndescribe.\n\nBased on what I had previously read, I thought &#39;Purascharana&#39; wa=\r\ns a certain number of repetitions of the Name or Mantra of God, as a suppli=\r\ncation or prayer, with proper feeling. Even this is difficult for me at tim=\r\nes. Sometimes I say the mantra with feeling, sometimes with boredom (and ch=\r\necking the clock to see when japa time will be over). Sometimes I barely ma=\r\nnage to fit in the number of malas I have set for myself in the day. Luckil=\r\ny, though God&#39;s grace, I am kind of on track, if only in terms of doing a c=\r\nertain number of repetitions in a certain amount of time.\n\nSo basically, I =\r\nguess I am not doing Purascharana in the way you describe...I guess that I =\r\ndoing a japa practice, that involves a certain number of repetitions in a c=\r\nertain period of time.\n\nI feel comforted by this practice, and feel it&#39;s th=\r\ne right thing for me to do. I feel one doesn&#39;t have to be qualified to do J=\r\napa....the Japa gives one all the qualifications that one lack&#39;s including =\r\nproper devotion. \n\nSivananda says that even mechanical repetition has some =\r\neffect, though repetition with feeling is ideal. This helps me to do japa, =\r\nwhen my mind rebels saying &quot;there is no feeling!&quot;....I tell myself, some ja=\r\npa is better than no japa!\n\nThe way I mentally see my sadhana is:\n\n1. Japa =\r\nwith some feeling, devotion- Ideal\n2. Japa with no feeling- Not ideal, but =\r\nstill better than no japa\n3. No japa at all during the day- very bad. Worst=\r\n case scenario. :)\n\nThanks for the information about Purascharana. I hope t=\r\nhe Japa qualifies me to do a true Purascharana one day. :)\n\nOm Namo Narayan=\r\naya\n\nAparna\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;raja=\r\nrshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Om Namah Narayanaya\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;\n&gt; I agree =\r\nwe have to keep striving....&#39;personal&#39; effort has to \n&gt; continue...what a m=\r\nahabharatha this inner fight is! Definitely need God \n&gt; as the charioteer f=\r\nor any chance of success.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Absolutely! One huge Mahabharata of confus=\r\nions, errors, failings, again getting up and trying, not stopping, changing=\r\n the gunas of ones sadhana etc etc. Grace is vital.\n&gt; \n&gt; BUT, and here is a=\r\n big cause, many times people mistake the workings of their own lower natur=\r\ne (Apara Prakriti) as some sort of grace. This is nothing but an attempt by=\r\n different parts - of below the surface of the working mind -=C2=A0 to pull=\r\n back the sadhana and hang on to the old personality.\n&gt; \n&gt; The whole of sad=\r\nhana, in a nutshell, is changing our, stupid, flawed, ignorant surface pers=\r\nonality. And once you do so, you WILL be forced to renegotiate your old lif=\r\ne-equations. But there is a lower prakirit in man and nature as well, which=\r\n works through the automated motions of our prana shakti, that needs to be =\r\ncontrolled. It has no light of God within it. Light is knowledge. At the hi=\r\ngher spiritual levels light and will are fused together. In our plane of ex=\r\nistence light, that is correct knowledge, and will have become separated an=\r\nd distorted. Therefore often you may have the will to achieve to something =\r\nbut not the right knowledge needed for it. This leads to confusions.\n&gt; \n&gt; A=\r\nnyway grace is product of true surrenderance from the mind, from the deeper=\r\n emotional being and the physical being. These also correspond to the consc=\r\niousness working in manomaya-kosha, pranamaya-kosha and annamaya-kosha. Unt=\r\nil this is reached, grace does not come, and even if it does, it gets perve=\r\nrted by our lower nature. In Gita Bhagawan calls it Apara-Prakriti. \n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\nt is one thing to say verbally that all sadhana being done is work of God&#39;s=\r\n Shakti. It is entirely different matter to see it clearly for which one mu=\r\nst a) surrender constantly b) reject and withdraw ones lower nature, or at =\r\nleast keep it clam and checked c) make a sincere call to God. Only when the=\r\nse three work together, grace descends. And only grace has the power to cau=\r\nse a thorough transformation of a sadhaka. Nothing less. But you can&#39;t dema=\r\nnd grace, you can&#39;t beg for grace, you can&#39;t plead, you can&#39;t command, and =\r\nyou can&#39;t indulge in self-pity. We have to calmly and patiently wait for it=\r\n for when the time is right, it calls like a sweet rain on a parched throat=\r\n, and in a flash it can do more than what we can imagine. Basically, we can=\r\nnot negotiate with God. Nothing less than a complete honest recoking on wha=\r\nt we are, where we are heading, what mistakes lie in our nature is a must.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Then slowly you will be made to realize the working of a higher Power =\r\nthat has nothing to do with your little surface personalities push and pull=\r\ns based on Pavlovian responses to situations incurred over lifetimes. It is=\r\n this Power, once understood, that needs to be unquestioningly submitted to=\r\n in a progressive manner, while rejecting everything else inside us that pu=\r\nll us in a different direction and wants to hang on to our earlier flawed p=\r\nersonality. Long, long, long road. Patience is a key.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; A few general thoughts on Purusacharana since there wer=\r\ne a few mails on this topic. Again, just my opinion. Feel free to reject it=\r\n if needed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Start with the word. Purusha+acharana. Behaving like a man=\r\n. And what does it mean? Some may say it means being brave, being mentally =\r\nrobust, being aggressive, or being commanding etc. All these are terms that=\r\n are often used in colloquial language to indicate a proverbial &#39;manly&#39; beh=\r\navior. But in sadhana, Purusha is a different concept. Looking inwards and =\r\nseparating a part of your being, from the mind, from your thoughts, from yo=\r\nur emotions, and even from your physcial nature. This part of your being wi=\r\nll only stand back and watch, as silent witness, and then either give or re=\r\nject consent to various movements of your lower nature (lust, anger, jealou=\r\nsy, greed, covetousness, ETC). Once this is firmly installed in your system=\r\n - this Purusha - it will be able to stop and clam down various parts of yo=\r\nur being which have the tendency to leap-up in joy (sukha) or get deflated =\r\n(dukhkha) at surface appearances and shallow understandings. This is how a =\r\nPurusha\n&gt;  works in Yoga. When this kind of Purusha consciounsess is instal=\r\nled and established, an expansion of the mind happens beyond the rational, =\r\nthe emotional or even the physical nature/consciousness.\n&gt; \n&gt; After this ba=\r\nsic step has been done properly, then the sadhana of purushacharana is to b=\r\ne done. By this method, a progressive 1/10 numerical deduction in the sadha=\r\nna is done for each element. That is for 1000 japas, 100 homas, 10 tarpana,=\r\n 1 marjana and finally feeding people. Each of this will affect a realizati=\r\non of the mantra is each of the layers - in reverse order from annamaya-kos=\r\nha, to pranamaya-kosha, to manomaya-kosha to vigyanmaya-kosha (the spiritua=\r\nl layers beyond and above the reasoning mind). THAT is the perfect effect o=\r\nf a spotless purushacharana. That is mantra siddhi and mantra chaitanya.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; While doing a purushacharana, tremenodus amount of obstacles will come i=\r\nn the path of the sadhaka. To overcome these, while sticking to the exactin=\r\ng rules of the sadhana, one MUST have done the first step properly, that is=\r\n installed a Purusha consciousness in his/her system, one that is unshakeab=\r\nle in any adverse conditions. One that is perfectly unmoved by the working =\r\nof the lower nature in man as well as outside man. For example, one may get=\r\n affected by high fever, various crisis situations, various attacks from ho=\r\nstile forces etc etc, Many things. But inspite of that the Purusha consciou=\r\nness, if it has been firmly established, will drive the sadhana without a g=\r\nlitch, remaining unmoved. Of course, one must honestly judge how far such a=\r\n consciousness has been developed. Self-delusion has to be guarded against.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; One can try for oneself to do purushacharanas and see how far one suc=\r\nceeds. In my opinion though, 98 % of seekers in this age are unfit to do pu=\r\nrushacharana and succeed in this sadhana. For the Purusha consciousness has=\r\n not been established in the system by most people. In the last 6 years amo=\r\nng all varieties of sadhakas I have met, of various paths, only two were th=\r\nere who I felt can pull off a genuine purusacharana. Rest no chance.\n&gt; \n&gt; D=\r\noing any sadhana at the same time, same place, using same materials, withou=\r\nt breaks for years and years is always good. Goes without saying. This too,=\r\n most people cannot do flawlessly. Purushacharana is far more complex and d=\r\nemanding. \n&gt; \n&gt; Then the other option is to develop genuine surrender from =\r\nthe deepest part of your heart. Do sadhana, and wait patiently. Her grace i=\r\ns bound to come and illuminate the path. Meanhile, we can keep working on r=\r\nectifying the lower nature in ourselves.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jai Ma Tara.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mA=\r\nmabuddhayah |\n&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _=\r\n_______________________________\n&gt;  From: sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, 23 October 2012 3:07 PM\n=\r\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re:\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Namaste Rajarshiji,\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\nhat is a very interesting way of looking at a yantra.

Respectfully yet firmly I disagree on one=\r\n point.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;Myself: Doesnt that only apply to purascharaNa (based on=\r\n what I read in \n&gt; &gt; Aghore book - as everybody in this group is already fa=\r\nmiliar with that \n&gt; &gt; book series)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: No it applie=\r\ns to anything. PurascharaNa or regular \n&gt; &gt; chanting. Doesnt matter. The ru=\r\nle is always 1:100 or at least 1:10. You \n&gt; &gt; have to follow it strictly.&gt;.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is always good to do japa, but &quot;strict&quot; is too strong a w=\r\nord. There are many in different parts of India, well versed in sadhana as =\r\nwell as respective shastras (respective because no single human being can k=\r\nnown all possible Hindu Shastras, so most study that which maybe relevant t=\r\no his line of spiritual inquiry followed in his tradition) who do homas wit=\r\nhout doing any pre-requisite japa. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One honest question that every=\r\n sadhaka must ask himself/herself objectively is, how badly do we want God?=\r\n If the desire pure and unblemished, or is it also mixed with various other=\r\n desires, however small they maybe. If we also want other materialistic thi=\r\nngs along with it - and there is no harm in wanting legitimate things - the=\r\nn one can follow all instructions and rules set for whatever parampara one =\r\nis mentally afflicted to and given by his/her Guru(s). \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But if one=\r\n is desirous of ONLY God without any other desire attached to it, no rule i=\r\ns sufficient, no path is a guarantee, no sadhana is sure-shot way to achiev=\r\ne it.=C3=82=C2=A0 Working on internal surrender to God and increased detach=\r\nment in daily life along with and through whatever ritual one performs and =\r\nin whatever manner, can be more helpful in the long run. Human aspiration a=\r\nlone is not enough. When the aspiration is genuine and pure, He/She extends=\r\n his/her energy to lift the sadhak up.. this dual phenomenon together make =\r\na sadhana success. And this simple yet powerful truth is represented by the=\r\n six-pointed triangle which is the basic yantra of so many deities, and spe=\r\ncially one form of the Mother. The upward triangle is our aspiration, the d=\r\nownward is Her grace coming down to transform the sadhak from his/her curre=\r\nnt state. Together, it makes a complete whole. And grace is purely proporti=\r\nonal to the purity of the aspiration, which only God can judge\n&gt; &gt;  accurat=\r\nely.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0Rajarshi \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; awaktam wyak=\r\ntimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |\n&gt; &gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanut=\r\ntamam ||[7:24]\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ________________________________\n&gt; &gt;  From: as=\r\nhutosh.srikanth &lt;ashutosh.srikanth@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, 22 October 2012 5:17 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Homam=\r\n - Ahuti numbers\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; My pranams to all.\n&gt; &gt; I h=\r\nave been performing weekly havan for more than a year and half.\n&gt; &gt; I want =\r\nto point out certain things related to havan so that it can be done as per =\r\nshastra by others too.\n&gt; &gt; I am using a conversation that in fact took plac=\r\ne to bring out these relevant points.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sometime back there was info=\r\nrmal &quot;prashNa&quot; session whose summary I am presenting below: \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Sout=\r\nh Indians might be familiar with similar &quot;ashTamangala prashNa&quot; conducted i=\r\nn temples when something goes wrong - called as dosha.]\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; PrashNa co=\r\nnductor: There seems to be a dosha...

And what is the dosha in my ahuti apa=\r\nrt from that?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: Do you do required Japa before gi=\r\nving ahutis? And do you do the ahuti with the same mantra that you use for =\r\nyour regular japa?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Myself: What?... Required Japa? Is there a pre-=\r\nrequisite like that? No I dont do any pre-defined set of japa?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Pra=\r\nshNa conductor: Yes. Strictly the japa-ahuti ratio is shatamsha. (that is f=\r\nor every 100 recitation of a mantra via meditation, one becomes qualified f=\r\nor one ahuti) or at least it should be dashamsha ( i.e. for every 10 recita=\r\ntions of mantra in meditation, one is qualified to give 1 ahuti)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; M=\r\nyself: Doesnt that only apply to purascharaNa (based on what I read in Agho=\r\nre book - as everybody in this group is already familiar with that book ser=\r\nies)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: No it applies to anything. PurascharaNa or=\r\n regular chanting. Doesnt matter. The rule is always 1:100 or at least 1:10=\r\n. You have to follow it strictly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The conversation went onto sever=\r\nal other things. Subsequently I went on to get mantra-upadesha from a accom=\r\nplished seer and reciting that mantra and also using the same mantra for my=\r\n ahuti in homam as per the above mentioned ratio only and have been very ha=\r\nppy with my spiritual progress since. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Whether all the homa-practi=\r\noners in this group agree with me or not, I just wanted to point this out t=\r\no all requesting everybody to perform at least 10 times Japa of the mantra =\r\nused for ahuti to get the &quot;qualification&quot; for the ahuti.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Ashutosh\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
