Rao&quot; &lt;pvr108@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank=\r\ns to Rajarshi for the well-written, inspiring and excellent series on his e=\r\nxperiences with Manish at Kashi.\n&gt; \n&gt; Krishnendu, I can understand where yo=\r\nu are coming from. However, there is one more angle to consider.\n&gt; \n&gt; Manis=\r\nh told me long back that we should guard against focusing on &quot;personalities=\r\n&quot; and building awe. He said we should focus on sadhana. He said, &quot;my messag=\r\ne is not that I am special, but it is that everyone is special. My assertio=\r\nn is not that I found god, but it is that everyone can and should find god.=\r\n I am a normal person. If I could find god, anybody could. As people do hom=\r\nam sincerely and unselfishly for a few years, there will be many people who=\r\n make great progress. World will be a changed place.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Manish said, &quot;pe=\r\nople should do sadhana. Don&#39;t waste time when you are on earth. Never give =\r\nthe excuse that you don&#39;t know how to do sadhana. Do whatever you can. If y=\r\nou know how to do homam, do homam. Otherwise do japam. Or you can sit down =\r\nand do a bhajan chanting god&#39;s name. Do some sadhana or the other for as mu=\r\nch time as you can. Don&#39;t worry about the results, but keep doing sadhana t=\r\no the best of your ability.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I have personally seen clear indications that Manish operates on a di=\r\nfferent plane compared to most people. I will give a few small examples in =\r\nthis writeup. However, I want to re-iterate that Manish does not see himsel=\r\nf as a special person or a &quot;man of god&quot; as you say, but sees himself as a s=\r\nmall instrument of Nature.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I mention any supernatural things invo=\r\nlving Manish, the goal is to show that such things are possible even now an=\r\nd not just limited to books and stories. As Rajarshi wisely said, we &quot;educa=\r\nted city people&quot; lack faith. True, skepticism is useful as a lot of fake pe=\r\nople do exploit the blind faith of people, but the pendulum has swung too f=\r\nar and educated people have lost faith so completely that it is almost cyni=\r\ncal.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is like lazy people of a village who do not have the energy =\r\nand patience to climb a hill next to the village refusing to believe that a=\r\nnybody can climb that hill. Thus, if someone climbs the hill, finds somethi=\r\nng nice on the hill and wants to inspire others to climb it, such accounts =\r\nwill be inspiring.\n&gt; \n&gt; The goal is to inspire and enable a group of spirit=\r\nual aspirants to do sadhana, become powerful instruments of Nature and end =\r\nup inspiring many more people. The ultimate goal is to uphold Veda dharma o=\r\nf rishis in the world.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nWhen we went to Calcutta to visit Dakshineshwar, we stayed near the Kaligha=\r\nt temple. We could not find a hotel room as hotels were full and someone at=\r\n a temple referred us to a nearby house that was being converted to a lodge=\r\n. House owners lived upstairs. We checked in our luggage downstairs. Manish=\r\n told me, &quot;we have a rina with this couple. His wife is very sincere and sp=\r\niritual. We need to do something.&quot; We met his wife later and saw her horosc=\r\nope. She was indeed quite spiritual. She is a worshipper of Sarada Mata and=\r\n Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and a regular visitor of Ramakrishna Mutt.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ma=\r\nnish showed a very tall wall on one side of that property and asked them, &quot;=\r\nis there a smashaan (cemetary) on the other side of that wall&quot;. They said n=\r\no. Manish said, &quot;hmm, it somehow feels like that.&quot; That person clarified th=\r\nen, &quot;it is a house and not a smashaan, but this house was a small mosque se=\r\nveral decades ago and they supposedly buried several people of that large f=\r\namily in the backyard itself.&quot; After all, Manish&#39;s &quot;perception&quot; was correct=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW, we two ended up doing two simultaneous Ganapathi homas on the n=\r\next night next to that wall.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; On his advice, one lady started chanting Chandipath everyday to solve=\r\n some problem with her son, which was bothering her very much.\n&gt; \n&gt; Oneday =\r\nManish talked to her daughter. He asked her, &quot;what is your mother doing? Sh=\r\ne is doing Chandipath alright, but she is asking for weird things. Check wi=\r\nth her and ask her to stop asking those things.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; When she cornered her=\r\n mother on what she was asking, her mother finally revealed that she was fr=\r\nustrated with the situation with her son and so was asking Devi at the time=\r\n of Chandipath to take her life so that she does not have to see her son&#39;s =\r\nsituation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Her daughter straightened her out and she stopped that. As =\r\na postscript, her son&#39;s problem was solved after she did Chandipath for a f=\r\new more weeks.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; Manish t=\r\nold me a few times that he &quot;knows&quot; when someone thinks of him.\n&gt; \n&gt; When we=\r\n were staying at a hotel in Kurukshetra, Manish said to me one evening, &quot;th=\r\ne hotel owner is thinking of me right now. He is thinking about me and mone=\r\ny.&quot; Interestingly, phone in the room rang in a minute and it was the hotel =\r\nowner. He called to ask if we wanted to pay for the next day ahead instead =\r\nof paying in the morning.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Manish came to Seatle, USA for a conference in fall 2005 and I met him p=\r\nhysically for the first time then. After lunch, we were walking around. Sud=\r\ndenly, Manish declared, &quot;there is a rudraaksha maalaa meant for your son cl=\r\nose to here. I can sense it. Let us go and find it.&quot; We walked quite a dist=\r\nance. Then he said, &quot;this is the place.&quot; There was a big country market kin=\r\nd of place in a small shopping complex. We went in, but found nothing. We c=\r\name out of the complex. Manish looked around and said, &quot;no, this is the pla=\r\nce. I was confused by the smell from the fish market inside this complex. L=\r\net us try again.&quot; We went in again and this time Manish took me inside a sm=\r\nall alley and there was a small mom & pop kind of shop selling some Tibetan=\r\n things. They had several Rudraaksha maalaas. Manish picked one, bought it =\r\nand gave it for my son.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n I mentioned this earlier. Manish told me oneday that he &quot;saw me&quot; doing my =\r\ndaily Chandi homam while he was driving fast on a highway in UK. He lifted =\r\none hand in abhaya mudra (blessing pose) while driving. His wife asked what=\r\n he was doing. He said he told her, &quot;Narasimha is doing homam right now. I =\r\nam blessing him.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; When he mentioned this, I wanted to verify it. I nor=\r\nmally wear red or yellow or white veshti and anga vastram (lower cloth and =\r\nupper cloth) for my homam. That day I was wearing a blue veshti and a blue =\r\nT-shirt. I was gifted that blue veshti by a priest and wore it only twice u=\r\nntil now. So one is unlikely to *guess* this. I asked him, &quot;if you saw me, =\r\ntell me what kind of clothes I was wearing.&quot; He said, &quot;Narasimha, it seemed=\r\n like some shade of blue. You were wearing a T-shirt and it was also anothe=\r\nr shade of blue.&quot; He was correct. If one was merely guessing it, the probab=\r\nility of getting is correct was very very small - almost zero.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; When we went to Pune, Delhi and Kur=\r\nukshetra for the Krishna movie shooting, it rained heavily. In May, it was =\r\na bit early for the monsoon rains. When we reached the temple at Mayapur, M=\r\nanish said that nature was pleased with the work on Krishna and rains where=\r\nver we went was a sign. Sometimes Manish says big-sounding things like this=\r\n, which may give an impression that he is proud. But I realized that it is =\r\nnot because of pride, but he was simply making observations from the plane =\r\nhe is in. From where others are, they may sound weird or proud or pretentio=\r\nus.\n&gt; \n&gt; I kind of dismissed him, &quot;well, it could be a coincidence. It is v=\r\nery hot here right now and I see no clouds anywhere. If it rains here today=\r\n, I will believe your theory.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Manish seriously looked at the sky and =\r\nnodded his head. Because it was too hot, we retired into our room at the ac=\r\ncommodation there, unpacked our stuff and got tripod etc ready. Within ten =\r\nminutes, we heard loud thunders. In a few minutes, there was a heavy thunde=\r\nrstorm that lasted half an hour. There were puddles of water everywhere. Ma=\r\nnish remarked, &quot;see, it rained here also. Gods are happy with this work. Th=\r\nis film is an important work.&quot; The rest of the day and next day was perfect=\r\n and we shot what we wanted. \n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 =\r\n*\n&gt; \n&gt; During March 2006 Shata Chandi homam at the Kaalikambal temple in Ch=\r\nennai where Mother gave a darshan to Manish and asked to start a homam move=\r\nment, I was meditating in the garbhalaya one evening, sitting in front of M=\r\nanish. We were both meditating on Savitri Gayatri mantra. After half hour o=\r\nr so, I lost normal awareness of my body and I felt like I was some all-per=\r\nvading orange light. I saw that there was a person at the center of that li=\r\nght, who was emiting that light. When I looked closer, it was Manish. After=\r\n a little time, he suddenly transformed into a very famous saint from the p=\r\nast. I wondered &quot;why did Manish change into that saint&quot;. That disturbed my =\r\nfocus and my regular self-awareness returned and I became aware that I was =\r\nNarasimha meditating in that garbhalaya and Manish was sitting in front of =\r\nme. I opened my eyes. At the same time, Manish also opened his eyes. Withou=\r\nt my saying anything, he asked &quot;you saw me, no?&quot; I was surprised that he\n&gt; =\r\n knew it. However, what baffled me the most was why he transformed into tha=\r\nt saint. I stuttered, &quot;but...&quot;. Without my finishing it, he remarked, &quot;you =\r\nsee Narasimha, the blessings of my guru of last life are still with me. Tha=\r\nt is why you saw him in me!&quot; He not only knew what I saw, but explained it =\r\nsuccintly.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; I was sleepi=\r\nng oneday. In the middle of the night, I woke up. When I was still on the b=\r\ned and partially awake, my shakti rose. In other words, my self-awareness g=\r\not refined. I first perceived a tremendous bolt of electricity going up in =\r\nmy back. Then, in a split second, my perception of that electricity changed=\r\n from &quot;shakti inside me&quot; to &quot;I inside shakti&quot;. My changed perception was th=\r\nat there was a tremendous amount of shakti that was surging up like an ocea=\r\nn wave and encompassing everything that was there and that I was a very tin=\r\ny particle in that tremendous wave. Moreover, I also &quot;heard&quot; a specific bee=\r\njaakshara being chanted together by millions of people, who were all tiny p=\r\narticles in that wave. That wave reverberated with the sound of that beejaa=\r\nkshara and I perceived that I too was chanting that beejaakshara along with=\r\n all. My mind was filled with that sound and a kind of bliss. My self-aware=\r\nness was that of a tiny particle filled with that sound\n&gt;  and joy and noth=\r\ning else. I was unaware of anything else. Compared to my normal mental stat=\r\ne, it was a very simple and yet fantastic state to be in. I was in that sta=\r\nte for a while. Suddenly a thought that can be loosely expressed as &quot;Amn&#39;t =\r\nI on the bed in a room? How am I hearing this loud sound? Are there people =\r\nin the room&quot; came to my mind. That thought disturbed the state of my mind a=\r\nnd my shakti came down. In other words, I returned to the regular level of =\r\nself-awareness and again perceived that I was a body lying on a bed in a ro=\r\nom. The bliss was gone and mind was again filled with hundreds of thoughts =\r\nas usual.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; I mentioned this incident a few days later to Manish. Whe=\r\nn this happened, it was the middle of the night for me and morning for Mani=\r\nsh. When I mentioned the incident and said that I heard the sound of a beej=\r\naakshara reverberating in the wave in which I was a small particle, Manish =\r\nimmediately said he knew it and also mentioned the specific beejaakshara an=\r\nd asked &quot;that is what you heard, right?&quot; That was indeed correct. Moreover,=\r\n I had never meditated with that beejaakshara before and it is not somethin=\r\ng one would expect me to have a mystical experience with.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I confi=\r\nrmed that was the beejaakshara I heard, Manish shed some light: &quot;I was at t=\r\nhat time meditating with that beejaakshara. So and so deity came and filled=\r\n my consciousness. I then went into a nice samadhi. Some people close to me=\r\n may also have experienced that deity at that time. But we should realize t=\r\nhat this is all Her play and we are just nimittas. What she does and why sh=\r\ne does, she knows and we do not. We are just dummies observing what comes o=\r\nur way. We neither make anything happen nor should we desire anything to ha=\r\nppen. Just be and observe. Do not be attracted or repelled by anything.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; When Manish called me in =\r\nmid-2004, he told me, &quot;You are doing good work by giving free astrology sof=\r\ntware and doing several poojas, but you are not experiencing anything. Time=\r\n has now come for your Kundalini to awaken and for you to start experiencin=\r\ng things&quot;. I thought he was crazy. He sent me a Rudraaksha maalaa and asked=\r\n me to do 2x108 times Gayatri mantra everyday using that maalaa while maint=\r\naining brahmacharya (celibacy) and keeping the back straight and without an=\r\ny body movement at all. I ignored the Rudraaksha maalaa sent by him for man=\r\ny months before starting the practice he wanted in May 2005. I experienced =\r\nsomething very intense, powerful, profound and life changing within 18 days=\r\n of starting the practice.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I mentioned what happened to him, he l=\r\naughed and said, &quot;now an irreversible transformation has been kicked off&quot;. =\r\nHe said, &quot;we two were born together many times. Even if you think I am craz=\r\ny, you cannot leave me and will be pulled towards me. Such is our relations=\r\nhip. You don&#39;t know who you are and who I am, but I do.&quot; He also told me th=\r\nen about his first phone call to me in 2004: &quot;I did not have your phone num=\r\nber but wanted to connect with you. When I was in a trance after meditation=\r\n, I simply picked up the phone and dialed whatever digits my hand felt like=\r\n pressing. Then I got you on the phone.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Though I still thought he was=\r\n crazy, I knew that what I had experienced was too profound and the coincid=\r\nence that it happened soon after starting to use his maalaa was too strong,=\r\n to ignore. I started to wonder if he was genuine after all, but his manner=\r\n of speaking was still too weird for me. I never hid my thoughts from him a=\r\nnd shared freely.\n&gt; \n&gt; My journey since then has been very interesting and =\r\nI have shared parts of it on this yahoogroup. Someone said Rajarshi&#39;s mails=\r\n reminded of Vimalananda. There is indeed something Vimalananda-like about =\r\nManish. In fact, Manish says he is like a spiritual son to Vimalananda and =\r\nholds Vimalananda in great esteem. I don&#39;t know Vimalananda, but I know Man=\r\nish and I can imagine several things mentioned by Vimalananda in &quot;Aghora&quot; s=\r\neries books being correct.\n&gt; \n&gt; Despite some of his supernatural abilities =\r\nthat I have seen, like the ability to create a specific mystical experience=\r\n in someone thousands of miles away, he insists that Devi does everything a=\r\nnd he is just a small instrument and an observer of Devi&#39;s leelaa and a sma=\r\nll player in the big game of chess being played by Devi. In fact, his main =\r\nteaching to me was to improve devotion, faith and surrender and give up doe=\r\nrship of my actions.\n&gt; \n&gt; His teachings are sublime and yet practical. He i=\r\ns not content to explain theory, but practically demonstrates the weaknesse=\r\ns of mind and how to overcome them. Instead of swimming in modern pseudo-ve=\r\ndanta, he made me understand and appreciate duality and non-duality at the =\r\nsame time. He made me understand things through experience. He brought grea=\r\nt change in my attitude and thinking in the last 5.5 years of interaction. =\r\nHe destroyed my biases and expanded the horizons of my understanding and ga=\r\nve a much better perspective.\n&gt; \n&gt; Most importantly, using me as an instrum=\r\nent, he enabled many sincere spiritual seekers to embrace the ancient Vedic=\r\n sadhana of rishis - homam or fire ritual for saattwik purposes. He tells m=\r\ne that one lakh (one hundred thousand) people will be doing homam on a regu=\r\nlar basis one hundred years from now.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I said at the beginning of th=\r\nis email, inspiring sadhana is more important than inspiring awe regarding =\r\nspecific personalities, though the latter sometimes helps with the former.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; I will conclude with Ma=\r\nnish&#39;s words I mentioned before:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;My message is not that I am special,=\r\n but it is that everyone is special. My assertion is not that I found god, =\r\nbut it is that everyone can and should find god. I am a normal person. If I=\r\n could find god, anybody could. As people do homam sincerely and unselfishl=\r\ny for a few years, there will be many people who make great progress. World=\r\n will be a changed place.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;People should do sadhana. Don&#39;t waste time=\r\n when you are on earth. Never give the excuse that you don&#39;t know how to do=\r\n sadhana. Do whatever you can. If you know how to do homam, do homam. Other=\r\nwise do japam. Or you can sit down and do a bhajan chanting god&#39;s name. Do =\r\nsome sadhana or the other for as much time as you can. Don&#39;t worry about th=\r\ne results, but keep doing sadhana to the best of your ability.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Best r=\r\negards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------\n&gt; =A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish W=\r\nritings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpan=\r\na:\n&gt; =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 http://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org\n&gt; =A0=A0=A0=A0 Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiF=\r\nilms.org\n&gt; =A0=A0=A0=A0 Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-w=\r\nisdom\n&gt; =A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings=\r\n\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n --- On Mon, 1/18/10, chaudhuri.krishnendu &lt;krishnenduchdhr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; F=\r\nrom: chaudhuri.krishnendu &lt;krishnenduchdhr@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] R=\r\nesected Narasimhaji\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Monday, Janu=\r\nary 18, 2010, 2:06 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     =\r\n\n&gt;       \n&gt;       \n&gt;       From time to time various sayings and incidents =\r\nrelated to Manishji are scattered in this forum and maybe at other places.H=\r\nis site also contains\n&gt; \n&gt; some valuable materials.Will it not be nice to a=\r\nrchive them as i feel they are great pieces of inspiration.
