The very color, the very=\r\n orange robe gives strength and purity. I do not believe those people who s=\r\nay, =E2=80=9CWe have given coloring to our hearts.=E2=80=9D This is timidit=\r\ny and hypocrisy. If there is real internal change, the external change is b=\r\nound to come. You cannot be a sage inside and a rogue outside. The inner na=\r\nture will not allow you to keep an opposite nature outside. I do not admit =\r\nthat merely an attainment towards eradication of egoism, sankalpas and vasa=\r\nnas, does really constitute sannyasa. The ashrama-bheda is absolutely neces=\r\nsary. Why did sages like Shankara and Sri Ramakrishna take sannyasa? Why di=\r\nd Yajnavalkya take sannyasa even after the realization of Brahman? Where is=\r\n the necessity for this order at all?\n\nSome people say, =E2=80=9CThink for =\r\nyourself, there is no need of spiritual rules or spiritual initiation.=E2=\r\n=80=9D O ignorant man! How can you think for yourself? If I ask you to enqu=\r\nire Who am I?=E2=80=9D you will think you are Mr. so and so, born of such-a=\r\nnd-such a person, with such a height and weight, and having such a name. Is=\r\n this the enquiry of =E2=80=9CWho am I?=E2=80=9D Is this thinking for yours=\r\nelf? Ignorant people cannot think for themselves. \n\n\n"}}
