A Muslim resident of Kuwait requeste=\r\nd historical research material that can help explain the connection between=\r\n Hindu civilisation and Arabia.]\nWas the Kaaba Originally a Hindu Temple?\nB=\r\ny P.N. Oak (Historian)\nGlancing through some research material recently, I =\r\nwas pleasantly surprised to come across a reference to a king Vikramaditya =\r\ninscription found in the Kaaba in Mecca proving beyond doubt that the Arabi=\r\nan Peninsula formed a part of his Indian Empire.\nThe text of the crucial Vi=\r\nkramaditya inscription, found inscribed on a gold dish hung inside the Kaab=\r\na shrine in Mecca, is found recorded on page 315 of a volume known as =E2=\r\n=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=80=99 treasured in the Makhtab-e-Sultania library in=\r\n Istanbul, Turkey. Rendered in free English the inscription says:\n&quot;Fortunat=\r\ne are those who were born (and lived) during king Vikram=E2=80=99s reign. H=\r\ne was a noble, generous dutiful ruler, devoted to the welfare of his subjec=\r\nts. But at that time we Arabs, oblivious of God, were lost in sensual pleas=\r\nures. Plotting and torture were rampant. The darkness of ignorance had enve=\r\nloped our country. Like the lamb struggling for her life in the cruel paws =\r\nof a wolf we Arabs were caught up in ignorance. The entire country was enve=\r\nloped in a darkness so intense as on a new moon night. But the present dawn=\r\n and pleasant sunshine of education is the result of the favour of the nobl=\r\ne king Vikramaditya whose benevolent supervision did not lose sight of us- =\r\nforeigners as we were. He spread his sacred religion amongst us and sent sc=\r\nholars whose brilliance shone like that of the sun from his country to ours=\r\n. These scholars and preceptors through whose benevolence we were once agai=\r\nn made cognisant of the presence of God, introduced to His sacred\n existenc=\r\ne and put on the road of Truth, had come to our country to preach their rel=\r\nigion and impart education at king Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s behest.&quot;\nFor thos=\r\ne who would like to read the Arabic wording I reproduce it hereunder in Rom=\r\nan script:\n&quot;Itrashaphai Santu Ibikramatul Phahalameen Karimun Yartapheeha W=\r\nayosassaru Bihillahaya Samaini Ela Motakabberen Sihillaha Yuhee Quid min ho=\r\nwa Yapakhara phajjal asari nahone osirom bayjayhalem.

Because the inscription says that king Vi=\r\nkram who dispelled the darkness of ignorance from Arabia. \n2.=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 That, whatever their earlier faith, King Vikrama=E2=80=\r\n=99s preachers had succeeded in spreading the Vedic (based on the Vedas, th=\r\ne Hindu sacred scriptures)) way of life in Arabia. \n3.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 That the knowledge of Indian arts and sciences was imparted by In=\r\ndians to the Arabs directly by founding schools, academies and cultural cen=\r\ntres. The belief, therefore, that visiting Arabs conveyed that knowledge to=\r\n their own lands through their own indefatigable efforts and scholarship is=\r\n unfounded. \nAn ancillary conclusion could be that the so-called Kutub Mina=\r\nr (in Delhi, India) could well be king Vikramadiya=E2=80=99s tower commemor=\r\nating his conquest of Arabia. This conclusion is strengthened by two pointe=\r\nrs. Firstly, the inscription on the iron pillar near the so-called Kutub Mi=\r\nnar refers to the marriage of the victorious king Vikramaditya to the princ=\r\ness of Balhika. This Balhika is none other than the Balkh region in West As=\r\nia. It could be that Arabia was wrestled by king Vikramaditya from the rule=\r\nr of Balkh who concluded a treaty by giving his daughter in marriage to the=\r\n victor. Secondly, the township adjoining the so called Kutub Minar is name=\r\nd Mehrauli after Mihira who was the renowned astronomer-mathemat ician of k=\r\ning Vikram=E2=80=99s court. Mehrauli is the corrupt form of Sanskrit =E2=80=\r\n=98Mihira-Awali=E2=80=99 signifying a row of houses raised for Mihira and h=\r\nis helpers and assistants working on astronomical observations made from th=\r\ne tower.\nHaving seen the far reaching and history shaking implications of t=\r\nhe Arabic inscription concerning king Vikrama, we shall now piece together =\r\nthe story of its find. How it came to be recorded and hung in the Kaaba in =\r\nMecca. What are the other proofs reinforcing the belief that Arabs were onc=\r\ne followers of the Indian Vedic way of life and that tranquillity and educa=\r\ntion were ushered into Arabia by king Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s scholars, educ=\r\nationists from an uneasy period of &quot;ignorance and turmoil&quot; mentioned in the=\r\n inscription.\nIn Istanbul, Turkey, there is a famous library called Makhata=\r\nb-e-Sultania , which is reputed to have the largest collection of ancient W=\r\nest Asian literature. In the Arabic section of that library is an anthology=\r\n of ancient Arabic poetry. That anthology was compiled from an earlier work=\r\n in A.D. 1742 under the orders of the Turkish ruler Sultan Salim.\nThe pages=\r\n of that volume are of Hareer =E2=80=93 a kind of silk used for writing on.=\r\n Each page has a decorative gilded border. That anthology is known as Sayar=\r\n-ul-Okul. It is divided into three parts. The first part contains biographi=\r\nc details and the poetic compositions of pre-Islamic Arabian poets. The sec=\r\nond part embodies accounts and verses of poets of the period beginning just=\r\n after prophet Mohammad=E2=80=99s times, up to the end of the Banee-Um-Mayy=\r\na dynasty. The third part deals with later poets up to the end of Khalif Ha=\r\nrun-al-Rashid=E2=80=99s times.\nAbu Amir Asamai, an Arabian bard who was the=\r\n poet Laureate of Harun-al-Rashid=E2=80=99s court, has compiled and edited =\r\nthe anthology.\nThe first modern edition of =E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=80=99 =\r\nwas printed and published in Berlin in 1864. A subsequent edition is the on=\r\ne published in Beirut in 1932.\nThe collection is regarded as the most impor=\r\ntant and authoritative anthology of ancient Arabic poetry. It throws consid=\r\nerable light on the social life, customs, manners and entertainment modes o=\r\nf ancient Arabia. The book also contains an elaborate description of the an=\r\ncient shrine of Mecca, the town and the annual fair known as OKAJ which use=\r\nd to be held every year around the Kaaba temple in Mecca. This should convi=\r\nnce readers that the annual haj of the Muslims to the Kaaba is of earlier p=\r\nre-Islamic congregation.\nBut the OKAJ fair was far from a carnival. It prov=\r\nided a forum for the elite and the learned to discuss the social, religious=\r\n, political, literary and other aspects of the Vedic culture then pervading=\r\n Arabia. =E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=80=99 asserts that the conclusion reache=\r\nd at those discussions were widely respected throughout Arabia. Mecca, ther=\r\nefore, followed the Varanasi tradition (of India) of providing a venue for =\r\nimportant discussions among the learned while the masses congregated there =\r\nfor spiritual bliss. The principal shrines at both Varanasi in India and at=\r\n Mecca in Arvasthan (Arabia) were Siva temples. Even to this day ancient Ma=\r\nhadev (Siva) emblems can be seen. It is the Shankara (Siva) stone that Musl=\r\nim pilgrims reverently touch and kiss in the Kaaba.\nArabic tradition has lo=\r\nst trace of the founding of the Kaaba temple. The discovery of the Vikramad=\r\nitya inscription affords a clue. King Vikramaditya is known for his great d=\r\nevotion to Lord Mahadev (Siva). At Ujjain (India), the capital of Vikramadi=\r\ntya, exists the famous shrine of Mahankal, i.e., of Lord Shankara (Siva) as=\r\nsociated with Vikramaditya. Since according to the Vikramaditya inscription=\r\n he spread the Vedic religion, who else but he could have founded the Kaaba=\r\n temple in Mecca?\nA few miles away from Mecca is a big signboard which bars=\r\n the entry of any non-Muslim into the area. This is a reminder of the days =\r\nwhen the Kaaba was stormed and captured solely for the newly established fa=\r\nith of Islam. The object in barring entry of non-Muslims was obviously to p=\r\nrevent its recapture.\nAs the pilgrim proceeds towards Mecca he is asked to =\r\nshave his head and beard and to don special sacred attire that consists of =\r\ntwo seamless sheets of white cloth. One is to be worn round the waist and t=\r\nhe other over the shoulders. Both these rites are remnants of the old Vedic=\r\n practice of entering Hindu temples clean- and with holy seamless white she=\r\nets.\nThe main shrine in Mecca, which houses the Siva emblem, is known as th=\r\ne Kaaba. It is clothed in a black shroud. That custom also originates from =\r\nthe days when it was thought necessary to discourage its recapture by camou=\r\nflaging it.\nAccording to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, the Kaaba has 360 im=\r\nages. Traditional accounts mention that one of the deities among the 360 de=\r\nstroyed when the place was stormed, was that of Saturn; another was of the =\r\nMoon and yet another was one called Allah. That shows that in the Kaaba the=\r\n Arabs worshipped the nine planets in pre-Islamic days. In India the practi=\r\nce of =E2=80=98Navagraha=E2=80=99 puja, that is worship of the nine planets=\r\n, is still in vogue. Two of these nine are Saturn and Moon.\nIn India the cr=\r\nescent moon is always painted across the forehead of the Siva symbol. Since=\r\n that symbol was associated with the Siva emblem in Kaaba it came to be gra=\r\nfted on the flag of Islam.\nAnother Hindu tradition associated with the Kaab=\r\na is that of the sacred stream Ganga (sacred waters of the Ganges river). A=\r\nccording to the Hindu tradition Ganga is also inseparable from the Shiva em=\r\nblem as the crescent moon. Wherever there is a Siva emblem, Ganga must co-e=\r\nxist. True to that association a sacred fount exists near the Kaaba. Its wa=\r\nter is held sacred because it has been traditionally regarded as Ganga sinc=\r\ne pre-Islamic times (Zam-Zam water).\n[Note: Even today, Muslim pilgrims who=\r\n go to the Kaaba for Haj regard this Zam-Zam water with reverence and take =\r\nsome bottled water with them as sacred water.]\nMuslim pilgrims visiting the=\r\n Kaaba temple go around it seven times. In no other mosque does the circuma=\r\nmbulation prevail. Hindus invariably circumambulate around their deities. T=\r\nhis is yet another proof that the Kaaba shrine is a pre-Islamic Indian Shiv=\r\na temple where the Hindu practice of circumambulation is still meticulously=\r\n observed.\nThe practice of taking seven steps- known as Saptapadi in Sanskr=\r\nit- is associated with Hindu marriage ceremony and fire worship. The culmin=\r\nating rite in a Hindu marriage enjoins upon the bride and groom to go round=\r\n the sacred fire four times (but misunderstood by many as seven times). Sin=\r\nce &quot;Makha&quot; means fire, the seven circumambulations also prove that Mecca wa=\r\ns the seat of Indian fire-worship in the West Asia.\nIt might come as a stun=\r\nning revelation to many that the word =E2=80=98ALLAH=E2=80=99 itself is San=\r\nskrit. In Sanskrit language Allah, Akka and Amba are synonyms. They signify=\r\n a goddess or mother. The term =E2=80=98ALLAH=E2=80=99 forms part of Sanskr=\r\nit chants invoking goddess Durga, also known as Bhavani, Chandi and Mahisha=\r\nsurmardini. The Islamic word for God is., therefore, not an innovation but =\r\nthe ancient Sanskrit appellation retained and continued by Islam. Allah mea=\r\nns mother or goddess and mother goddess.\nOne Koranic verse is an exact tran=\r\nslation of a stanza in the Yajurveda. This was pointed out by the great res=\r\nearch scholar Pandit Satavlekar of Pardi in one of his articles.\n[Note: Ano=\r\nther scholar points out that the following teaching from the Koran is exact=\r\nly similar to the teaching of the Kena Upanishad (1.7).\nThe Koran:\n&quot;Sight p=\r\nerceives Him not. But He perceives men&#39;s sights; for He is the knower of se=\r\ncrets, the Aware.&quot;\nKena Upanishad:\n&quot;That which cannot be seen by the eye bu=\r\nt through which the eye itself sees, know That to be Brahman (God) and not =\r\nwhat people worship here (in the manifested world).&quot;\nA simplified meaning o=\r\nf both the above verses reads:\nGod is one and that He is beyond man&#39;s senso=\r\nry experience.\nThe identity of Unani and Ayurvedic systems shows that Unani=\r\n is just the Arabic term for the Ayurvedic system of healing taught to them=\r\n and administered in Arabia when Arabia formed part of the Indian empire.\nI=\r\nt will now be easy to comprehend the various Hindu customs still prevailing=\r\n in West Asian countries even after the existence of Islam during the last =\r\n1300 years. Let us review some Hindu traditions which exist as the core of =\r\nIslamic practice.\nThe Hindus have a pantheon of 33 gods. People in Asia Min=\r\nor too worshipped 33 gods before the spread of Islam. The lunar calendar wa=\r\ns introduced in West Asia during the Indian rule. The Muslim month =E2=80=\r\n=98Safar=E2=80=99 signifying the =E2=80=98extra=E2=80=99 month (Adhik Maas)=\r\n in the Hindu calendar. The Muslim month Rabi is the corrupt form of Ravi m=\r\neaning the sun because Sanskrit =E2=80=98V=E2=80=99 changes into Prakrit =\r\n=E2=80=98B=E2=80=99 (Prakrit being the popular version of Sanskrit language=\r\n). The Muslim sanctity for Gyrahwi Sharif is nothing but the Hindu Ekadashi=\r\n (Gyrah =3D elevan or Gyaarah). Both are identical in meaning.\nThe Islamic =\r\npractice of Bakari Eed derives from the Go-Medh and Ashva-Medh Yagnas or sa=\r\ncrifices of Vedic times. Eed in Sanskrit means worship. The Islamic word Ee=\r\nd for festive days, signifying days of worship, is therefore a pure Sanskri=\r\nt word. The word MESH in the Hindu zodiac signifies a lamb. Since in ancien=\r\nt times the year used to begin with the entry of the sun in Aries, the occa=\r\nsion was celebrated with mutton feasting. That is the origin of the Bakari =\r\nEed festival.\n[Note: The word Bakari is an Indian language word for a goat.=\r\n] \nSince Eed means worship and Griha means =E2=80=98house=E2=80=99, the Isl=\r\namic word Idgah signifies a =E2=80=98House of worship=E2=80=99 which is the=\r\n exact Sanskrit connotation of the term. Similarly the word =E2=80=98Namaz=\r\n=E2=80=99 derives from two Sanskrit roots =E2=80=98Nama=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=\r\n=98Yajna=E2=80=99 (NAMa yAJna) meaning bowing and worshipping.\nVedic descri=\r\nptions about the moon, the different stellar constellations and the creatio=\r\nn of the universe have been incorporated from the Vedas in Koran part 1 cha=\r\npter 2, stanza 113, 114, 115, and 158, 189, chapter 9, stanza 37 and chapte=\r\nr 10, stanzas 4 to 7.\nRecital of the Namaz five times a day owes its origin=\r\n to the Vedic injunction of Panchmahayagna (five daily worship- Panch-Maha-=\r\nYagna) which is part of the daily Vedic ritual prescribed for all individua=\r\nls.\nMuslims are enjoined cleanliness of five parts of the body before comme=\r\nncing prayers. This derives from the Vedic injuction =E2=80=98Shareer Shydh=\r\nyartham Panchanga Nyasah=E2=80=99.\nFour months of the year are regarded as =\r\nvery sacred in Islamic custom. The devout are enjoined to abstain from plun=\r\nder and other evil deeds during that period. This originates in the Chaturm=\r\nasa i.e., the four-month period of special vows and austerities in Hindu tr=\r\nadition. Shabibarat is the corrupt form of Shiva Vrat and Shiva Ratra. Sinc=\r\ne the Kaaba has been an important centre of Shiva (Siva) worship from times=\r\n immemorial, the Shivaratri festival used to be celebrated there with great=\r\n gusto. It is that festival which is signified by the Islamic word Shabibar=\r\nat.\nEncyclopaedias tell us that there are inscriptions on the side of the K=\r\naaba walls. What they are, no body has been allowed to study, according to =\r\nthe correspondence I had with an American scholar of Arabic. But according =\r\nto hearsay at least some of those inscriptions are in Sanskrit, and some of=\r\n them are stanzas from the Bhagavad Gita.\nAccording to extant Islamic recor=\r\nds, Indian merchants had settled in Arabia, particularly in Yemen, and thei=\r\nr life and manners deeply influenced those who came in touch with them. At =\r\nUbla there was a large number of Indian settlements. This shows that Indian=\r\ns were in Arabia and Yemen in sufficient strength and commanding position t=\r\no be able to influence the local people. This could not be possible unless =\r\nthey belonged to the ruling class.\nIt is mentioned in the Abadis i.e., the =\r\nauthentic traditions of Prophet Mohammad compiled by Imam Bukhari that the =\r\nIndian tribe of Jats had settled in Arabia before Prophet Mohammad=E2=80=99=\r\ns times. Once when Hazrat Ayesha, wife of the Prophet, was taken ill, her n=\r\nephew sent for a Jat physician for her treatment. This proves that Indians =\r\nenjoyed a high and esteemed status in Arabia. Such a status could not be th=\r\neirs unless they were the rulers. Bukhari also tells us that an Indian Raja=\r\n (king) sent a jar of ginger pickles to the Prophet. This shows that the In=\r\ndian Jat Raja ruled an adjacent area so as to be in a position to send such=\r\n an insignificant present as ginger pickles. The Prophet is said to have so=\r\n highly relished it as to have told his colleagues also to partake of it. T=\r\nhese references show that even during Prophet Mohammad=E2=80=99s times Indi=\r\nans retained their influential role in Arabia, which was a dwindling legacy=\r\n from Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s times.\nThe Islamic term =E2=80=98Eed-ul-Fitr=\r\n=E2=80=99 derives from the =E2=80=98Eed of Piters=E2=80=99 that is worship =\r\nof forefathers in Sanskrit tradition. In India, Hindus commemorate their an=\r\ncestors during the Pitr-Paksha that is the fortnight reserved for their rem=\r\nembrance. The very same is the significance of =E2=80=98Eed-ul-Fitr=E2=80=\r\n=99 (worship of forefathers) .\nThe Islamic practice of observing the moon r=\r\nise before deciding on celebrating the occasion derives from the Hindu cust=\r\nom of breaking fast on Sankranti and Vinayaki Chaturthi only after sighting=\r\n the moon.\nBarah Vafat, the Muslim festival for commemorating those dead in=\r\n battle or by weapons, derives from a similar Sanskrit tradition because in=\r\n Sanskrit =E2=80=98Phiphaut=E2=80=99 is =E2=80=98death=E2=80=99. Hindus obs=\r\nerve Chayal Chaturdashi in memory of those who have died in battle.\nThe wor=\r\nd Arabia is itself the abbreviation of a Sanskrit word. The original word i=\r\ns =E2=80=98Arabasthan=E2=80=99. Since Prakrit =E2=80=98B=E2=80=99 is Sanskr=\r\nit =E2=80=98V=E2=80=99 the original Sanskrit name of the land is =E2=80=98A=\r\nrvasthan=E2=80=99. =E2=80=98Arva=E2=80=99 in Sanskrit means a horse. Arvast=\r\nhan signifies a land of horses., and as well all know, Arabia is famous for=\r\n its horses.\nThis discovery changes the entire complexion of the history of=\r\n ancient India. Firstly we may have to revise our concepts about the king w=\r\nho had the largest empire in history. It could be that the expanse of king =\r\nVikramaditya=E2=80=99s empire was greater than that of all others. Secondly=\r\n, the idea that the Indian empire spread only to the east and not in the we=\r\nst beyond say, Afghanisthan may have to be abandoned. Thirdly the effeminat=\r\ne and pathetic belief that India, unlike any other country in the world cou=\r\nld by some age spread her benign and beatific cultural influence, language,=\r\n customs, manners and education over distant lands without militarily conqu=\r\nering them is baseless. India did conquer all those countries physically wh=\r\nerever traces of its culture and language are still extant and the region e=\r\nxtended from Bali island in the south Pacific to the Baltic in Northern Eur=\r\nope and from Korea to Kaaba. The only difference was that while Indian rule=\r\nrs\n identified themselves with the local population and established welfare=\r\n states, Moghuls and others who ruled conquered lands perpetuated untold at=\r\nrocities over the vanquished.\n=E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=80=99 tells us that=\r\n a pan-Arabic poetic symposium used to be held in Mecca at the annual Okaj =\r\nfair in pre-Islamic times. All leading poets used to participate in it.\nPoe=\r\nms considered best were awarded prizes. The best-engraved on gold plate wer=\r\ne hung inside the temple. Others etched on camel or goatskin were hung outs=\r\nide. Thus for thousands of years the Kaaba was the treasure house of the be=\r\nst Arabian poetic thought inspired by the Indian Vedic tradition.\nThat trad=\r\nition being of immemorial antiquity many poetic compositions were engraved =\r\nand hung inside and outside on the walls of the Kaaba. But most of the poem=\r\ns got lost and destroyed during the storming of the Kaaba by Prophet Mohamm=\r\nad=E2=80=99s troops. The Prophet=E2=80=99s court poet, Hassan-bin-Sawik, wh=\r\no was among the invaders, captured some of the treasured poems and dumped t=\r\nhe gold plate on which they were inscribed in his own home. Sawik=E2=80=99s=\r\n grandson, hoping to earn a reward carried those gold plates to Khalif=E2=\r\n=80=99s court where he met the well-known Arab scholar Abu Amir Asamai. The=\r\n latter received from the bearer five gold plates and 16 leather sheets wit=\r\nh the prize-winning poems engraved on them. The bearer was sent away happy =\r\nbestowed with a good reward.\nOn the five gold plates were inscribed verses =\r\nby ancient Arab poets like Labi Baynay, Akhatab-bin- Turfa and Jarrham Bint=\r\noi. That discovery made Harun-al-Rashid order Abu Amir to compile a collect=\r\nion of all earlier compositions. One of the compositions in the collection =\r\nis a tribute in verse paid by Jarrham Bintoi, a renowned Arab poet, to king=\r\n Vikramaditya. Bintoi who lived 165 years before Prophet Mohammad had recei=\r\nved the highest award for the best poetic compositions for three years in s=\r\nuccession in the pan-Arabic symposiums held in Mecca every year. All those =\r\nthree poems of Bintoi adjudged best were hung inside the Kaaba temple, insc=\r\nribed on gold plates. One of these constituted an unreserved tribute to Kin=\r\ng Vikramaditya for his paternal and filial rule over Arabia. That has alrea=\r\ndy been quoted above.\nPre-Islamic Arabian poet Bintoi=E2=80=99s tribute to =\r\nking Vikramaditya is a decisive evidence that it was king Vikramaditya who =\r\nfirst conquered the Arabian Peninsula and made it a part of the Indian Empi=\r\nre. This explains why starting from India towards the west we have all Sans=\r\nkrit names like Afghanisthan (now Afghanistan) , Baluchisthan, Kurdisthan, =\r\nTajikiathan, Uzbekisthan,=C2=A0 Iran, Sivisthan, Iraq, Arvasthan, Turkestha=\r\nn (Turkmenisthan) etc.\nHistorians have blundered in not giving due weight t=\r\no the evidence provided by Sanskrit names pervading over the entire west As=\r\nian region. Let us take a contemporary instance. Why did a part of India ge=\r\nt named Nagaland even after the end of British rule over India? After all h=\r\nistorical traces are wiped out of human memory, will a future age historian=\r\n be wrong if he concludes from the name Nagaland that the British or some E=\r\nnglish speaking power must have ruled over India? Why is Portuguese spoken =\r\nin Goa (part of India), and French in Pondichery (part of India), and both =\r\nFrench and English in Canada? Is it not because those people ruled over the=\r\n territories where their languages are spoken? Can we not then justly concl=\r\nude that wherever traces of Sanskrit names and traditions exist Indians onc=\r\ne held sway? It is unfortunate that this important piece of decisive eviden=\r\nce has been ignored all these centuries.\nAnother question which should have=\r\n presented itself to historians for consideration is how could it be that I=\r\nndian empires could extend in the east as far as Korea and Japan, while not=\r\n being able to make headway beyond Afghanisthan? In fact land campaigns are=\r\n much easier to conduct than by sea. It was the Indians who ruled the entir=\r\ne West Asian region from Karachi to Hedjaz and who gave Sanskrit names to t=\r\nhose lands and the towns therein, introduce their pantheon of the fire-wors=\r\nhip, imparted education and established law and order.\nIt may be that Arabi=\r\na itself was not part of the Indian empire until king Vikrama , since Binto=\r\ni says that it was king Vikrama who for the first time brought about a radi=\r\ncal change in the social, cultural and political life of Arabia. It may be =\r\nthat the whole of West Asia except Arabia was under Indian rule before Vikr=\r\nama. The latter added Arabia too to the Indian Empire. Or as a remote possi=\r\nbility it could be that king Vikramaditya himself conducted a series of bri=\r\nlliant campaigns annexing to his empire the vast region between Afghanistha=\r\nn and Hedjaz.\nIncidentally this also explains why king Vikramaditya is so f=\r\namous in history. Apart from the nobility and truthfulness of heart and his=\r\n impartial filial affection for all his subjects, whether Indian or Arab, a=\r\ns testified by Bintoi, king Vikramaditya has been permanently enshrined in =\r\nthe pages of history because he was the world=E2=80=99s greatest ruler havi=\r\nng the largest empire. It should be remembered that only a monarch with a v=\r\nast empire gets famous in world history. Vikram Samvat (calendar still wide=\r\nly in use in India today) which he initiated over 2000 years ago may well m=\r\nark his victory over Arabia, and the so called Kutub Minar (Kutub Tower in =\r\nDelhi), a pillar commemorating that victory and the consequential marriage =\r\nwith the Vaihika (Balkh) princess as testified by the nearby iron pillar in=\r\nscription.\nA great many puzzles of ancient world history get automatically =\r\nsolved by a proper understanding of these great conquests of king Vikramadi=\r\ntya. As recorded by the Arab poet Bintoi, Indian scholars, preachers and so=\r\ncial workers spread the fire-worship ceremony, preached the Vedic way of li=\r\nfe, manned schools, set up Ayurvedic (healing) centres, trained the local p=\r\neople in irrigation and agriculture and established in those regions a demo=\r\ncratic, orderly, peaceful, enlightened and religious way of life. That was =\r\nof course, a Vedic Hindu way of life.\nIt is from such ancient times that In=\r\ndian Kshtriya royal families, like the Pahalvis and Barmaks, have held sway=\r\n over Iran and Iraq. It is those conquests, which made the Parsees Agnihotr=\r\nis i.e., fire-worshippers. It is therefore that we find the Kurds of Kurdis=\r\nthan speaking a Sanskritised dialect, fire temples existing thousands of mi=\r\nles away from India, and scores of sites of ancient Indian cultural centres=\r\n like Navbahar in West Asia and the numerous viharas in Soviet Russia sprea=\r\nd throughout the world. Ever since so many viharas are often dug up in Sovi=\r\net Russia, ancient Indian sculptures are also found in excavations in Centr=\r\nal Asia. The same goes for West Asia.\n[Note: Ancient Indian sculptures incl=\r\nude metal statues of the Hindu deity Ganesh (the elephant headed god); the =\r\nmost recent find being in Kuwait].\nUnfortunately these chapters of world hi=\r\nstory have been almost obliterated from public memory. They need to be care=\r\nfully deciphered and rewritten. When these chapters are rewritten they migh=\r\nt change the entire concept and orientation of ancient history.\nIn view of =\r\nthe overwhelming evidence led above, historians, scholars, students of hist=\r\nory and lay men alike should take note that they had better revise their te=\r\nxt books of ancient world history. The existence of Hindu customs, shrines,=\r\n Sanskrit names of whole regions, countries and towns and the Vikramaditya =\r\ninscriptions reproduced at the beginning are a thumping proof that Indian K=\r\nshatriyas once ruled over the vast region from Bali to Baltic and Korea to =\r\nKaaba in Mecca, Arabia at the very least.\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-1024519386-1271853131=:51129\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste Jitendra ji,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;This&nbsp;article have been floating in the internet for quite so=\r\nme time, it&#39;s authenticity is questionable.

This conclusion is strengthened by two pointers. Firstly, the=\r\n inscription on the iron pillar near the so-called Kutub Minar refers to th=\r\ne marriage of the victorious king Vikramaditya to the princess of Balhika. =\r\nThis Balhika is none other than the Balkh region in West Asia. It could be =\r\nthat Arabia was wrestled by king Vikramaditya from the ruler of Balkh who c=\r\noncluded a treaty by giving his daughter in marriage to the victor. Secondl=\r\ny, the township adjoining the so called Kutub Minar is named Mehrauli after=\r\n Mihira who was the renowned astronomer-mathemat ician of king Vikram=E2=80=\r\n=99s court. Mehrauli is the corrupt form of Sanskrit =E2=80=98Mihira-Awali=\r\n=E2=80=99 signifying a row of houses raised for Mihira and his helpers and =\r\nassistants working\n on astronomical observations made from the tower.&lt;/SPAN=\r\n&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;P class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; COLOR: rgb(79=\r\n,98,40)&quot;&gt;Having seen the far reaching and history shaking implications of t=\r\nhe Arabic inscription concerning king Vikrama, we shall now piece together =\r\nthe story of its find. How it came to be recorded and hung in the Kaaba in =\r\nMecca.

Bintoi who lived 165 years before Prophet M=\r\nohammad had received the highest award for the best poetic compositions for=\r\n three years in succession in the pan-Arabic symposiums held in Mecca every=\r\n year. All those three poems of Bintoi adjudged best were hung inside the K=\r\naaba temple, inscribed on gold plates. One of these constituted an unreserv=\r\ned tribute to King Vikramaditya for his paternal and filial rule over Arabi=\r\na.
