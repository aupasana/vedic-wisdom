But do not use homam fire to make th=\r\ne offering.\n&gt;\n&gt; Another type of fire called kravyaada (funeral pyre) or rip=\r\nravaaha\n(carrier\n&gt; of impurities) can be used to carry anything, without re=\r\nstrictions.\nHowever,\n&gt; this fire is not used in homam.\n&gt;\n&gt; A few deities su=\r\nch as Smashaana Taaraa and Smashaana Kaali may be\nworshipped\n&gt; on a funeral=\r\n pyre with any materials. However, such rituals are not\n&gt; appropriate for 9=\r\n9.99999999% people.

As a result of\ntheir\n&gt; worshi=\r\np on funeral pyre, they may get results that are normally\nconsidered\n&gt; good=\r\n or results that are normally considered terrible, but again their\n&gt; mental=\r\n distinction between good and bad results is very low and they\naccept\n&gt; all=\r\n results with an equal vision.

Stick to regular homam and maintain basic\npurity,=\r\n no\n&gt; matter which deity you worship in the fire. In that case, throwing\nch=\r\nillies,\n&gt; meat and alcohol in fire is a strict no-no. Unfortunately, some p=\r\neople\ndo\n&gt; not realize it and throw these things in their homam fire.
