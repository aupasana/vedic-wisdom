I meditate and read,=\r\n but I somehow feel as if there is more that I can do.  As you put it earli=\r\ner, using the tools of duality to overcome duality.  And I had no clue how =\r\nto do this.\n\n&gt; Several of us perform a homam (fire ritual) as a\n&gt; spiritual=\r\n sadhana.\n\nThank you (and Rajarshi) for this recommendation.  Previously I =\r\nhad no real idea what a homam even was.  The links you provided below will =\r\nbe very helpful.  It may be a few weeks before I can get what is needed, an=\r\nd my living arrangements may make it a little difficult.  Would it be appro=\r\npriate to ask questions regarding the practical aspects of it on the forum?=\r\n\n\n&gt; BTW, I lived in Houston during 1991-1993. I did my\n&gt; masters at Rice Un=\r\niversity there.\n\nInteresting!  I live not relatively close to Rice, just ou=\r\nstide the southwest corner of the 610 loop.  There is now a Vedanta Society=\r\n within a few minutes of where I live, but I see it was only started in 200=\r\n2.  Just after I came to town, interestingly enough.\n\nDavyd\n\n\n\n"}}
