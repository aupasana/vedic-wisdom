What should I do?&quot;\n\nWhat is the reason behind not praying=\r\n at this time and what are the\nDos and Dont&#39;s to be followed.\n\nKind Regards=\r\n,\n\nSunita\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; =\r\n&lt;pvr@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Dogma is needed in the beginning of one=\r\n&#39;s sadhana, but should be\nrejected as one progresses. Otherwise, it becomes=\r\n a blockage instead\nof promoting progress. But it IS needed in the beginnin=\r\ng.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Dogma dictates maintaining several kinds of external purity when\nc=\r\nhanting mantras, slokas and prayers. The purpose of external purity\nis to e=\r\nventually promote internal purity.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If someone already has a high leve=\r\nl of internal purity and can focus\nthe mind on god irrespective of external=\r\n circumstances, external\npurity is irrelevant.\n&gt;  \n&gt; But, in the case of a =\r\nless evolved person, focussing on god is\ndifficult and depends on external =\r\nfactors. When one takes bath, wears\nclean clothes, sits in a nice room with=\r\n nice idols, nice lighting and\nincense etc, one may be able to focus mind o=\r\nn god and mantra a little\nbetter. So dogma requires all those things.\n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n If one is able to think of god&#39;s name all the time and one&#39;s mind\nsoars hi=\r\ngh irrespective of what the body is doing, it is foolish to\ntry to stop the=\r\n mind from soaring high and tying it down to the acts\nof the body. Dogma sh=\r\nould be dumped then.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; One lady told me once,=\r\n &quot;when I have my monthly periods, I am not\nsupposed to say mantras. But my =\r\nmind is used to always silently\nrepeating certain mantras and that continue=\r\ns during my periods also.\nWhat should I do? It is not easy for me to stop m=\r\ny mind. My mind is so\nused to saying those names. Why should I stop conscio=\r\nusly during my\nperiods? Is it a sin to say god&#39;s name?&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; This lady is =\r\nvery pure and clean-hearted. I see no reason to tell\nher, &quot;no lady, it is a=\r\n *sin* to say the mantra during your periods.&quot;\nOf course, any clear-sighted=\r\n person can see that it is NOT a sin to\nrepeat god&#39;s name, irrespective of =\r\nthe circumstances and surroundings.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; How to =\r\ndecide whether you should stick to dogma or dump it? If there\nis *any* litt=\r\nle feeling of guilt inside you when you break a rule of\ndogma, it means you=\r\n are not ready for breaking that rule. Then simply\nfollow dogma.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Supp=\r\nose saying Gayatri mantra when you are urinating makes you a\nlittle uncomfo=\r\nrtable or gives a little feeling of wrong-doing. Then\ndon&#39;t say it. Suppose=\r\n someone else realizes that Gayatri mantra says\nthat this entire universe i=\r\ns filled with the effulgence of Savita and\nthinks that the same Savita&#39;s ef=\r\nfulgence is in a god&#39;s idol, in one&#39;s\nown body, in one&#39;s urine and in the f=\r\nood one eats etc and there is no\nreal distinction between all of them. Then=\r\n he may chant Gayatri mantra\neven when urinating. What&#39;s wrong with it?\n&gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; If there is ANY amount of guilt in one when are breaking dogma, one\nprob=\r\nably needs to stick to dogma for more time.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha=\r\n\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do =\r\na Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tar=\r\npanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http=\r\n://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http:/=\r\n/vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.=\r\nVedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJag=\r\nannath.org\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---- \n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Chandra Prakash \n&gt;   T=\r\no: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Sunday, October 12, 2008 8:54 PM=\r\n\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Harish Johari&#39;s books\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Dear N=\r\narasimha,\n&gt; \n&gt;   Could you please elaborate on this statement.\n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot; Whe=\r\nther you are walking or talking or  driving or typing or reading \n&gt;   or wr=\r\niting or answering nature&#39;s calls, you can still silently\nchant His name in=\r\n the mind.\n&gt; \n&gt;   I once had a discussion with our priest.
