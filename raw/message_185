People find their path, make some progress and then \nfeel lost again.\n\nYou run the drigdasa of Pisces from March 2008 to March 2017. Taking Cancer \nas progressed lagna in Pisces dasa, the 9th house will be strong with \nMercury and Sun and the 9th lord Jupiter will be in lagna. The 8th house \nwill be prominent with Mars and Ketu, with 8th lords Saturn and Rahu \naspecting them from 2nd. These 4 malefics on the 8th house axis strongly \nsuggest powerful mystical experiences.\n\nYou are on the verge of a rewarding time spiritually speaking. Just keep \nyour faith and patience for a few more years and keep doing your sadhana.\n\nThe 5th house of devotion has Moon in rasi and vimsamsa. This shows devotion \nto Krishna. In navamsa, the 12th from atma karaka is empty and Mercury owns \nit. Mercury is in Scorpio with Rahu. This suggests that worship of Lord \nVaraha (Vishnu&#39;s boar incarnation) can give you fast spiritual progress.\n\nPlease contact suresh.battar@... (http://ashramaustralia.net) and ask \nhim where you can get a homa kundam in Australia. Swami Suresh Battar is a \nHindu priest in Canberra. In case homa kundas are available there, he may be \nable to direct you. In the worst case, any square or circle shaped vessel \nwith some depth (made of copper or bronze but not iron) can be used. Good \nluck for your homam.\n\nRegarding books, there are too many. But direct experience through \nmeditation is a far better teacher than books. Just surrender to the Lord, \naccept wholeheartedly that all the diverse objects our senses perceive in \nthis universe are all different manifestations of the Lord and that we are \nperceiving them differently because of our own impurity. If we keep \nreminding ourselves of this whenever our mind is overly attracted to or \nrepelled by something, that itself is a very useful sadhana. In addition, if \nyou spend a considerable time everyday in meditation, that too helps.\n\nFor you, I strongly recommend &quot;Jnaneshwari&quot;, a commentary on BhagavadGita by \nJnaneshwar Maharaj. This is a unique commentary by a unique saint, who is \nthe re-incarnation of a rishi and had a direct dwaitic and adwaitic \nexperience. There is a difference between writings coming from knowledge \nacquired by reading books or hearing from others and writings coming from \nthe knowledge acquired in a direct experience. More than 700 years ago, \nJnaneshwar Maharaj entered a cave in Alandi in his physical body at the age \nof 21 years and still meditating there. I have NOT read a more competent or \nsublime commentary on Krishna&#39;s teaching. It is quite an inspired work. A \ngood English translation of this work is available at\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Jnaneshwars-Gita-Jnaneshwari-Swami-Kripananda/dp/0911307648\n\n&quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; is the highest work on Hindu philosophy in my opinion. \nWhen Maharshi Viswamitra wanted Lord Ramachandra to come with him to forest, \nRama was in confusion and a little pensive. In the presence of Maharshi \nViswamitra, King Dasaratha and many other learned people, Maharshi Vasishtha \nimparted the essence of all Upanishats to Rama. His teachings were captured \nby Valmiki and the work is known as &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot;. There is an inspired \nEnglish translation available at\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Vasisthas-Yoga-Venkatesananda/dp/0791413640/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1201988303&sr=1-1\n\nVarious Puranas and Upanishats make a very useful reading too.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Sanjeev Narula&quot; &lt;san_narula@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, February 02, 2008 12:46 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Need more help\n\n\n&gt; Namaste Narasimha Ji and all other aspirants.\n&gt;\n&gt; Although this is my first writing in this group but i have been\n&gt; reading the threads for almost one year now. And you people have\n&gt; helped me a lot to find out the right path at many times but now i\n&gt; feel a bit lost again.\n&gt;\n&gt; As it can be seen from my chart details what brought me here( and to\n&gt; spiritual path) like many others. I still remember the thread where\n&gt; Narasimha Ji said that there is no need to fear of Sani and now i have\n&gt; realised what he meant.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have learned a little bit of astrology from this thread and from\n&gt; other  sources but with that i can not really make any decisions of\n&gt; the path i need to follow. As i have seen that there are many\n&gt; enlightened and intelligent aspirants in this group so if\n&gt; someone(especially Narasimha Ji)can look at my chart and guide me i\n&gt; will be very thankful. My birth details are given below:\n&gt;\n&gt; Birth Date- 17/03/1979\n&gt; Birth Time- 12:45 PM\n&gt; Birth Place- Ferozepur(Punjab), India\n&gt;\n&gt; Another thing is that till now i have been reading some\n&gt; Scriptures/Spiritual writings from here and there and doing some\n&gt; meditation and chanting of Mahamantra. I have really seen and\n&gt; experienced the effect of all this but all this was random and\n&gt; unplanned. Now i have come to a stage where i feel that my spiritual\n&gt; progress has stopped. So first of all i am thinking of reading more to\n&gt; get some knowledge but i have no idea what to read and from where to\n&gt; get the books.\n&gt;\n&gt; Second thing is i am planning to do Mahaganapathi Homam on a regular\n&gt; basis so i have bought all the Materials Needed except the homa kundam\n&gt; which i could not find as i live in Australia so can anyone tell me\n&gt; what else can i use as i can not even dig a pit in the ground.\n&gt;\n&gt; Although there are so many other things i want to ask but if someone\n&gt; can help me with only these i would be very thankful to him and i will\n&gt; pray to Lord for him.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance\n&gt; Sanjeev\n\n\n"}}
