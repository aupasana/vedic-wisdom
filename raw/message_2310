But, are they really one&#39;s own words and one&#39;s own ideas? One expresses what one has realized based on reading various masters, discussing with one&#39;s guru(s), meditating, contemplating and eventually digesting that knowledge.\n \nThus, I see nothing wrong in quoting a great saint or a yogi, as opposed to writing one&#39;s own thoughts.\n \nI started this list to share my thoughts on various spiritual matters. Based on my own experiences, I could finally make sense of various seemingly contradictory things I had read. I could put it all together in my mind and have a uniform, consistent, coherent and integrated understanding that put various things in the correct perspective. I wanted to promote such a wholesome and integrated understanding and do my part in &quot;bridging&quot; various &quot;islands&quot; of spiritual wisdom that exist out there. The other goal of this forum is to remove some fundamental confusions and misunderstandings that may be blocking some people from doing spiritual sadhana and making spiritual progress and encourage some people to do spiritual sadhana.\n \nIf words of a great yogi or saint that promote the same goal are shared, I see nothing wrong in it. The only thing is I request people to go a bit slow and not post too many such mails on the same day. Some people may be overwhelmed by the traffic and just delete the mails. One can slowly cover the ground one wants to cover, over a period of time. So please limit such posts.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- naaraayana_iyer &lt;narayan.iyer@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste Prasad,\n&gt; \n&gt; I guess he has the right to post what he wants. However, I agree with you. I see no point in the cut-paste posts. It would be more helpful if one adds one&#39;s opinion which could blossom into a positive discussion and a learning opportunity. After all, they might as well provide the web url or the book name and we could always buy it or read it online. If people take the contents directly from the web and paste it here, then I would strongly discourage this kind of posts. However, if they have painstakingly typed up the matter from books, then I don&#39;t have the heart to ask them to stop it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I usually skip these posts and others where the fonts are enlarged and bold to such a point that it makes it difficult to read and irritating. People should realize, in the internet/email medium, using upper-case, bold. italics have a different meaning especially if one wants to strongly emphasize a point. What&#39;s the point of writing the entire article in the same manner??\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyways, I don&#39;t want to write more on this topic and consume members bandwidth.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks & Regards\n&gt; Narayan\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vvootla&quot; &lt;vvootla@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ||| aum namO bhagavathE vAsudEvAya |||\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Members,\n&gt; &gt;      I&#39;m not sure what everyone&#39;s opinion is about the recent &#39;daily cut and paste from web&#39; kind of posts appearing on this forum, but I think this has to be discouraged. Otherwise, each member may soon start posting verbatim from their favorite books or websites or gurus or philosophies and with such &#39;daily spam&#39; there would not be many posts meant for reading/discussion. It is one thing to quote a relevant passage from a book or url or Master on a currently running topic and another to post along the recent patterns. One can always start a discussion sharing a piece of writing or speech by any Master/Book and open it to the forum for discussing issues, problems or clarifications by raising them explicitly along with the relevant material. If other members share my feeling on this then we can request the moderator to act accordingly. \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; -Prasad\n&gt; &gt; PS: I was thinking of turning some of my group subscriptions to direct email mode and evaluating the volume in each of those groups in recent past and I hit upon this in the process.\n\n\n"}}
