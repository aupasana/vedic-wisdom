Rao&quot; &lt;=\r\npvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; 1] Rahu homam manual will be created in t=\r\nime. Homam with the veda mantra \n&gt; &quot;kayaanschitra&quot; was suggested by Maharsh=\r\ni Parasara for relief from problems \n&gt; with Rahu. Some people also use Vyaa=\r\nsa&#39;s pouraanika mantra &quot;ardha kaayam&quot;. I \n&gt; will try to create Rahu and Ket=\r\nu homam manuals soon.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2] Apart from doing Rahu homam or japam of Rahu =\r\nmantra, one can pray to \n&gt; Chandi or Durga. The 700 verses known as &quot;Devi M=\r\naahaatmyam&quot; (glory of the \n&gt; goddess) or &quot;Durga saptashati&quot; (Durga&#39;s 700) o=\r\nr &quot;Chandipath&quot; (chanting of \n&gt; Chandi) are ideal. Those who are not fluent =\r\nin Sanskrit and not willing to \n&gt; try at all can try Durga/Chandi saptashlo=\r\nki, which is a collection of 7 \n&gt; representative verses out of those 700.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; It is possible to do a simple homam by using the Chandi homam manual on=\r\n the \n&gt; website below and use just the saptashloki (7 verse) for pradhaana =\r\nhomam. \n&gt; Just invoke the goddess in fire, offer 5 upachaaras, offer one aa=\r\nhuti to her \n&gt; parivaara devatas and then keep offering these 7 verses over=\r\n and over, as \n&gt; many times as you can.\n&gt; \n&gt; One can also pray to Lord Venk=\r\naeswara or Balaji for relief from Rahu \n&gt; problems.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Na=\r\nrasimha\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pi=\r\ntri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spiritualit=\r\ny: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3):=\r\n http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http=\r\n://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/JyotishWritings\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan=\r\nnath.org\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-- \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;rakesh.behal&quot; &lt;rakesh.behal=\r\n@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 14, 2=\r\n009 4:31 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] query\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear guru ji,\n&gt; &gt;   c=\r\nharan saparsh\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1] Pls design homa for rahu\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2] pls also sugge=\r\nst which sadhna are best to control rahu and avoid its \n&gt; &gt; bad effects\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; regds\n&gt; &gt; rakesh\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
