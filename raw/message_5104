Samadhi literally means\n&gt; concentration and fo=\r\ncus of awareness. In its normal state, mind is\n&gt; vibrating with too many th=\r\noughts and notions. In any state of samadhi,\n&gt; most of these thoughts and n=\r\notions disappear and mind achieves a high\n&gt; degree of focus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The fo=\r\ncus can be on a physical object perceived through senses (e.g.\n&gt; an idol or=\r\n the physical sound of a mantra) or a subtle object perceived\n&gt; by the subt=\r\nle perception (a deity or the subtle vibration of a mantra).\n&gt; The focus ca=\r\nn be on the gross/subtle object or on the act of perceiving\n&gt; the object or=\r\n on the perceiver (all the three exist within one&#39;s\n&gt; consciousness as thre=\r\ne different things). One&#39;s self-awareness can\n&gt; identify with one object an=\r\nd focus its attention on another object (&quot;I\n&gt; am Rajarshi with so and so qu=\r\nalities and I am aware of Bhairava with so\n&gt; and so qualities&quot;). Or, one&#39;s =\r\nself-awareness can identify with that\n&gt; object (&quot;I am Bhairava with so and =\r\nso qualities&quot;). Please note that all\n&gt; these samadhis are within the field =\r\nof duality. There is still a sense\n&gt; of &quot;this is I&quot; and &quot;this is the rest&quot;,=\r\n i.e. there is differentiation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The next state is wha=\r\nt most people refer to as samadhi. This is a\n&gt; state where mind is absorbed=\r\n in non-dual Self, i.e. without any\n&gt; differentiation. When there are no no=\r\ntions of &quot;this is I&quot; and &quot;this is\n&gt; the rest&quot;, there are no thoughts, no op=\r\nposites and there is only\n&gt; Sat-Chid-Ananda (the bliss of just being).\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now, let me come to what Vimalananda says!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The no=\r\nn-dual Self is Shiva (or Purusha or Narayana). The field of\n&gt; duality is Sh=\r\nakti (or Prakriti or Narayani). Though one may normally\n&gt; think that Shiva =\r\nand Shakti are different, are they really different?!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Because of ou=\r\nr notion that Shiva and Shakti are different, we can\n&gt; either be with Shakt=\r\ni or with Shiva at a time but not with both at the\n&gt; same time. A yogi who =\r\nhas objectification and the sense of &quot;this is I&quot;\n&gt; and &quot;this is the rest&quot; i=\r\ns in the domain of Shakti. When one overcomes\n&gt; objectification and reaches=\r\n non-dual samadhi, one is in the domain of\n&gt; Shiva. When one leaves that st=\r\nate and one&#39;s egosense (&quot;this is I&quot; and\n&gt; &quot;this is the rest&quot;) returns, one =\r\nwill *leave* the domain of Shiva and\n&gt; re-enter the field of Shakti. One is=\r\n prone to be deluded by duality\n&gt; again! That is what Vimalananda is saying=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If one can be with Shiva *and* Shakti at the *same time*, then on=\r\ne is\n&gt; then not enamored or deluded by any aspect of Shakti. When a small\n&gt;=\r\n aspect of Shakti enamors/deludes one (&quot;this is I&quot;, &quot;that is beautiful&quot;,\n&gt; =\r\n&quot;that is ugly&quot;, &quot;I like that&quot; etc), one is unable to perceive the entire\n&gt; =\r\nfield of Shakti. This is just like a person tied to a rock in the ocean\n&gt; n=\r\not being able to swim the entire ocean. When one is not bound by any\n&gt; obje=\r\nct in the field of Shakti and not attracted or repelled by anything,\n&gt; then=\r\n one can navigate the entire field, i.e. all space-time\n&gt; combinations. Thi=\r\ns is possible only if one has perfect mastery over\n&gt; Shakti. That comes onl=\r\ny when one has zero attachment to anything in the\n&gt; field of Shakti. That c=\r\nomes only when one is with Shiva enough and\n&gt; eventually becomes like Shiva=\r\n. If a yogi reaches non-dual samadhi, stays\n&gt; in it for a long time and hap=\r\npens to come back to the field of duality,\n&gt; then one may become like Shiva=\r\n and work with Shakti with zero attachment\n&gt; and perfect mastery. One is aw=\r\nare of the entire field of duality - all\n&gt; spaces and times - and yet unatt=\r\nached to anything. That is because one\n&gt; perceives the underlying non-dual =\r\nSelf even as senses perceive various\n&gt; objects of duality.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For most=\r\n people, this is out of bounds. One either experiences\n&gt; non-dual samadhi f=\r\nor a short duration and cannot sustain it longer and\n&gt; comes back to be del=\r\nuded by duality again, or one stays in non-dual\n&gt; samadhi for a long time a=\r\nnd does not come back (like a salt doll that\n&gt; goes to survey the depth of =\r\nocean melting in the ocean, to borrow words\n&gt; from Ramakrishna Paramahamsa)=\r\n. Exceptions like Ramakrishna Paramahamsa\n&gt; or Sai Baba, who spent enough t=\r\nime in non-dual samadhi and yet came back\n&gt; to live in the world, are so ra=\r\nre in this age.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Let me put this in terms of Kundalini=\r\n now. When Kundalini is in\n&gt; moolaadhaara, our self-awareness identifies wi=\r\nth the physical body and\n&gt; is aware of the physical world around us. As Kun=\r\ndalini goes to various\n&gt; places in the subtle body (there are thousands of =\r\nnadis and chakras!),\n&gt; one is aware of various realities that are out there=\r\n in this universe.\n&gt; For example, one world (realm of awareness) may be rev=\r\nerberating with\n&gt; the sound of a particular beejaakshara and filled with a =\r\nparticular\n&gt; light and every being in that world may be a small particle in=\r\n that\n&gt; light reverberating with that sound. Like that, there are many worl=\r\nds\n&gt; out there (within us) and one can enter a samadhi through any of them,=\r\n\n&gt; when Kundalini reaches a corresponding place.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When Kundalini rea=\r\nches sahasrara, one&#39;s self-awareness is with Shiva.\n&gt; Shakti loses herself =\r\nto Shiva and there is no objectification that is\n&gt; the hallmark of Shakti. =\r\nIf shakti comes back from sahasrara to a lower\n&gt; chakra, one&#39;s self-awarene=\r\nss is again deluded by duality. However, if\n&gt; shakti comes back from sahasr=\r\nara to mooladhara *accompanied by* Shiva,\n&gt; then one is aware of duality an=\r\nd non-dual Self at the same time. One\n&gt; lives as a liberated sage, using th=\r\ne body as an instrument to fulfil the\n&gt; will of Nature (since there is no l=\r\nonger any individual will).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; -----=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Free=\r\n Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish\n&gt; textbook,\n&gt; &gt; F=\r\nree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri\n&gt; Tarpana:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://S=\r\naraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wis=\r\ndom\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---- hramalingam@... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Samadi is nothing but killing=\r\n the mind and the entire thought\n&gt; process\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This will answer all your =\r\nquestions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent from my BlackBerry=C3=82=C2=AE on Reliance Mobile, Ind=\r\nia&#39;s No. 1\n&gt; Network.

I think it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is much better to reta=\r\nin consciousness on this plane even while you\n&gt; shift your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; main focus=\r\n to other realities. Here I am playing chess with you, but\n&gt; as I play I\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; can go to America to check how your parents are doing, or I can\n&gt; visit=\r\n Patala\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (the underworld), or the planet Venus, or my Guru Maharaj, or=\r\n\n&gt; whatever I please,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and still sit here acting as if I know nothing.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To be truly aware you have to know what is happening far=\r\n away today,\n&gt; what had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happened here long ago, and what is going to =\r\nhappen anywhere in the\n&gt; cosmos\n&gt; &gt; &gt; during the coming decades. But all th=\r\ne while you continue to\n&gt; function\n&gt; &gt; &gt; effectively in this time, space an=\r\nd causality.

Moreover, it is tough\n&gt; to ca=\r\npture\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some of these ideas in words, as words convey slightly differen=\r\nt\n&gt; meaning to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; different people, based on their life experiences and\n=\r\n&gt; predispositions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, there is no formula that ensures self-r=\r\nealization in a certain\n&gt; amount of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time and it comes to one through =\r\nthe grace of God. However, grace of\n&gt; God does\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not come to just about=\r\n anyone - it comes to one who is *ready* to\n&gt; receive it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One becomes=\r\n ready to receive it, through the effort put in this life\n&gt; and all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; p=\r\nrevious lives, to overcome weaknesses and conditioning. So effort\n&gt; and sad=\r\nhana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are not useless. The effort we are talking about here is not eff=\r\nort\n&gt; to acquire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something, but effort to give up something.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Though it is not incorrect, the view that things are given only by\n&gt; Go=\r\nd&#39;s grace\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can, when misunderstood, promote inaction. God&#39;s grace does=\r\n not come\n&gt; to a lazy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; person doing nothing and waiting for God&#39;s grac=\r\ne. God&#39;s grace does\n&gt; not work\n&gt; &gt; &gt; arbitrarily. God&#39;s grace comes to one =\r\nwho has perfect surrender to\n&gt; God. Perfect\n&gt; &gt; &gt; surrender does not come a=\r\nutomatically. Though effort and sadhana do\n&gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guarantee perfect su=\r\nrrender in a certain amount of time, they do\n&gt; bring it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; eventually.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whatever one does it is based on past karmas=\r\n only\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Fruits of past karmas decide one&#39;s current situation and =\r\nconstrain\n&gt; one&#39;s current\n&gt; &gt; &gt; karmas (actions). But they do not completel=\r\ny decide one&#39;s current\n&gt; karmas. One&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; current karma is in one&#39;s hand=\r\ns (within the constraints).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, one can ask: Does one ha=\r\nve a free will that acts or does\n&gt; an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all-pervading shakti act throug=\r\nh one? I am quoting a small portion\n&gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vedic-wisdom message 5009\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/5009) below:\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; All pervading shakti works through all of us and expresses through\n=\r\n&gt; all of our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; desires, actions and knowledge. But then, some universal=\r\n rules of\n&gt; action and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reaction govern how this works. Under the push=\r\n of one&#39;s own previous\n&gt; karmas, one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is placed in situations that are=\r\n conducive to certain desires,\n&gt; actions and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; awareness. The current k=\r\narmas in those situations may further modify\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; momentum of the pu=\r\nsh (reaction) from previous actions. Though one&#39;s\n&gt; current\n&gt; &gt; &gt; desires, =\r\nactions and awareness are actually the work of the all\n&gt; pervading\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sh=\r\nakti, they are also one&#39;s work in a way. It depends on how we look\n&gt; at it =\r\nand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; how we abstract it.

Until then, all pervading shakti acts through one to give\n&gt; appropriate\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; reactions to actions one thinks one is performing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In astrological terms, horoscope is the sum total of previous\n&gt; =\r\nkarmas, whose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fruits one will have to face.

Tendulkar may =\r\nscore a century\n&gt; with a terrible\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;backache, but we should not walk o=\r\nut to bat with a backache and\n&gt; should try to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;healthy.

The goal of all\n&gt; sadhana -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;meditation, japam, ho=\r\nmam, bhajan, service to others etc - is\n&gt; internal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;transformation. I=\r\nf the internal attitude is not getting refined,\n&gt; sadhana is yet\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to =\r\nwork.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If a room has a window outside =\r\nof which there is heavy wind that\n&gt; is constantly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;blowing a lot of d=\r\nirt into the room, sweeping the room with a broom\n&gt; does not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;elimina=\r\nte dirt. First close the window or stop the wind. Similarly,\n&gt; praanaayaama=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is not enough to purify the nadis and give mental purity, if mind\n&gt;=\r\n (room) is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;attached to the objects perceived by senses (window).\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one reads scriptures and teachings of=\r\n saints, contemplates on\n&gt; them,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;constantly analyzes inner motives b=\r\nehind various actions by oneself\n&gt; and tries to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;change one&#39;s own thi=\r\nnking slowly, this process of contemplation and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;introspection will a=\r\nugment one&#39;s external sadhana (such as\n&gt; meditation, japam,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;homam, b=\r\nhajan, service etc) and purifies one faster.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, it is useless to think in terms of Kundalini,\n&gt; awakeni=\r\nng Kundalini\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and raising Kundalini. Such thoughts are almost guarant=\r\need to\n&gt; either block\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Kundalini from rising or from reaching the hig=\r\nhest it can.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kundalini shakti is essentially a symbol of on=\r\ne&#39;s own\n&gt; self-awareness. Though\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;one is the infinite Self (Purusha),=\r\n one is &quot;aware&quot; of a limited\n&gt; object in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;field of duality (Shakt=\r\ni) springing in Self as &quot;self&quot;. That is why\n&gt; Kundalini\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;shakti is wo=\r\nrshipped as a form of the divine Mother (Shakti). This\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;self-awarenes=\r\ns is normally &quot;sleeping&quot;, i.e. one assumes that one is\n&gt; so and so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;p=\r\nerson and so and so body without questioning &quot;who am I&quot;. That is\n&gt; why Kund=\r\nalini\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is portrayed as sleeping in Mooladhara chakra (bhuloka or phys=\r\nical\n&gt; realm). As\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Kundalini awakens and rises to other chakras (othe=\r\nr lokas or realms\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;awareness), one&#39;s understanding of who one is=\r\n gets refined. When\n&gt; Kundalini\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;reaches sahasrara, one is aware of t=\r\nrue Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one thinks &quot;I am this body. There is a Kundali=\r\nni shakti at so\n&gt; and so point\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;in this body. It should now rise to s=\r\no and so point in this body&quot;,\n&gt; it will focus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and limit one&#39;s self-a=\r\nwareness to the *physical body* and hence\n&gt; one&#39;s Kundalini\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;will rem=\r\nain in moolaadhaara! For Kundalini to truly rise, one needs\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;com=\r\npletely forget about the physical body and stop thinking in\n&gt; terms of it.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, *very few* people actually experience Kundalini=\r\n in\n&gt; higher chakras,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;though many talk about it. Kundalini is in Moo=\r\nlaadhaara chakra or\n&gt; atmost\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Swadhishthana chakra in most yogis, eve=\r\nn advanced and awakened\n&gt; ones. When praana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;vaayu flows in some high=\r\ner chakras, that too can result in a\n&gt; powerful\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;experience. Some may=\r\n mistaken it for Kundalini.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you wa=\r\nnt a good score in the examination, study well. Stop\n&gt; thinking too much\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;about (and anticipating) the examination and focus on the subject\n&gt; in=\r\nstead.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Study, study, study. Similarly, forget about kundalini, forge=\r\nt\n&gt; about chakras,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;forget about the body even. Do sadhana, do sadhan=\r\na and do sadhana.\n&gt; Read\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;scriptures and teachings of great saints. I=\r\nnstead of looking\n&gt; externally and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;judging others, observe your own =\r\nactions and thoughts, analyze what\n&gt; is driving\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;them and consciously=\r\n try to eliminate wrong motives that stem from\n&gt; false ego,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;adharma =\r\nand arishadvarga (lust, anger, greed, delusion, wantonness,\n&gt; jealosy),\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;i.e. put to use the knowledge of scriptures and the teachings of\n&gt; sain=\r\nts.
