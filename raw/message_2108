You can m=\r\nove the coconut pieces anywhere to facilitate their burning.\n\n&gt; 2)Almost ev=\r\nery time some pieces are left  unburnt, so i do not remove the remains from=\r\n the kund and next time use it as it is and add fresh pieces of coconut.Is =\r\nit fine??\n\nYes. You can empty the ash and keep the unburnt or partially bur=\r\nnt pieces for the next homam.\n\nRegards\nNarayan\n\n\n"}}
