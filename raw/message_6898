Conscience will not help you unl=\r\ness you have reached the height of purity and understanding. The impure con=\r\nscience cannot give right suggestions. The pig thinks that the whole world =\r\nis full of pigs only, and that it itself is nothing more than a pig.

Conscience is one=E2=80=99s own habit and conviction. The conscience of t=\r\nhe individual speaks in accordance with his tendencies, proclivities, incli=\r\nnations, education, habits, passion and the like. The conscience of a savag=\r\ne speaks a language entirely different from that of a civilized European. H=\r\now can you depend upon this false so-called conscience? The conscience of a=\r\nn aboriginal brute speaks a language entirely different from that of an eth=\r\nically developed yogi of India. The sense of duty ingrained in the clerk of=\r\n a collectorate, a car-driver, a scavenger, are all different. There are te=\r\nn different consciences in ten different persons of the same district.
