I =\r\nwrote you the mail same day asking about it. and \ni got the mail from you a=\r\nccepting me as your disciple on 3rd of sept \n(Ganesh Chaturthi day).\n\nboth =\r\nthe above dates falls in the Mangal period, which is in Mithun \nRashi.\n\n*NO=\r\nW The main connection is that in my Birth Rashi chart, I have \nMithun Lagna=\r\n having Mars and Guru is in Dhanu* the situation exactly \nfound in yout TP&#39;=\r\n08 chart as indicated above. \n\nAdding to the above,Your TP&#39;08 Rashi chart h=\r\nas Kanya Lagna & my \nTP&#39;08 chart has also Kanya Lagna.\n\n2] Today just thoug=\r\nht of seeing the same chart (your TP&#39;08) with 7 \nor 8 CK scheme. Honest per=\r\nsuit to see how it shows up.\n\nsettings done for 8 CK scheme - Mangal is Pik=\r\n & Guru is BK hence no \nconnection to Shishya. PK is Budha debiliated. peri=\r\nod\n\nThe chart has no planets on the same degree. so let&#39;s apply the rule \no=\r\nf 7CK which has comeup as a fresh translation.\n\nMangal becomes MK. if we ap=\r\nply the second rule that MK also acts as \nPK. then things are explained. in=\r\n Mangal (PK) ATP Dasha you found, a \nShishya who intrestingly has Mangal in=\r\n Muthun Lagna.\n------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------\n\nNo way i am making any judgment about *working in practise* for 7=\r\n/8 \nCK. what i tried is just to apply on the said chart and found \nworking =\r\nnicely. however it is a long way to confirm if it works \npractically or not=\r\n.\n\nbut one thing is for sure that TP works amazingly. this is the one \ntool=\r\n which i love to use with good confidence.\n \nIs it not another confirmation=\r\n about GURU, Shishya & Jyotish Shastra?\n\nAadhyaatmically & Jyotishially you=\r\nrs,\n\nUtpal Pathak\n\n--- End forwarded message ---\n\n\n\n"}}
