A desireless man, whose desires have be=\r\nen fulfilled, who has risen above desires, whose desire is the atman, has n=\r\no necessity to act. It is not reasonable to ask the question as to why a pe=\r\nrson who is travelling does not fall into a pit or a mire in broad daylight=\r\n. If you say that a householder can remain in his state without doing karma=\r\n after he gets knowledge of Brahman, we say, it cannot be; for the househol=\r\nder=E2=80=99s life is based on desire. Sannyasa is cessation from all desir=\r\nes and not merely a change of the order. Therefore it is impossible for a K=\r\nnower to lead a householder=E2=80=99s life. \n\n\n"}}
