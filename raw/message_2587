When I started th=\r\nis\ninitially I had big doubts since on the first day I performed the Homam\n=\r\nmy elder son fell down and broke his tooth and had bleeding (I was\nreading =\r\nthe story of Ganesha losing his tooth to Parashurama&#39;s axe the\nsame day) an=\r\nd the next time I did the Homam my younger son caught his\nfoot in the templ=\r\ne door we were visiting on the same day (Ganesha\nguarding the door?) and go=\r\nt hurt.\n\nI was expecting some negative experiences to come my way when I st=\r\narted\nthe Homams as part of some karmic cleansing but I was expecting them =\r\nto\ncome my way and not the way of family members so was a bit surprised.  I=\r\n\nwas wondering if you have any thoughts on this.\n\nMy questions on Homam are=\r\n the following\n\n1.  Have you published a regular or long procedure for Maha=\r\nganapati\nHomam?  At some point I would like to try a longer version if that=\r\n is\navailable.  Is the difference only between the 5 types and the 16 types=\r\n\nof offering or there is more to it such as detailed puja of digpalas and\ng=\r\nrahas etc?\n\n2.  I recite Sri Rudram/Chamakam path for several years now and=\r\n would\nlike to do that via Homam.  Can you provide some guidance as to how =\r\nto\ndo this?  i.e. when to say swaha?  I think it is fairly logical to do\nth=\r\nat in Rudram but Chamakam is not so clear and swaha seems to come at\nthe en=\r\nd of each anuvaaka only.  Or perhaps Chamakam is only to be\nrecited and not=\r\n offered to Agni\n\nRegards\n\nVeenu\n\n\n\n"}}
