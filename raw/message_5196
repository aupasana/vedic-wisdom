Worshipping various forms is good and begets various results, but supreme is the worship of Supreme Being, who is beyond forms and manifestation and is inexpressible.\n \n*        *        *\n \nReaching the formless (or, in other words, the supreme inexpressible form) is not easy. Instead of trying to reach the formless, hold on to a form. Once you reach a form, reaching the formless through that form may be easier.\n \nDoing mental math may be better than jotting things down on a paper and doing the steps methodically on it. However, if you keep making mistakes in mental math, you&#39;re better off using a paper for the work!\n \n*        *        *\n \nAs worshipping or reaching the Supreme Being is not easy, we worship various deities (manifested forms) first and eventually trace our way back to the Supreme Being through that form. A Ganapathi worshipper in the beginnning may see Ganapathi as the remover of obstacles. Later, same Ganapathi may be realized as the Supreme Being as extolled in Ganapathi Atharvaseersham. It describes that all the worlds arise out of Ganapathi, are sustained by him and merge back in him, Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Indra, Agni, Vaayu etc are different forms of Ganapathi, etc etc. It is essentially tracing from a specific form of Ganapathi to the supreme being. Similar approach is taken with all forms.\n \n*        *        *\n \nTo give a crude analogy, gold can be used for many purposes. Specific forms like a gold ring and a golden arrow may be used for specific purposes. But gold itself can be fashioned in any form to fulfil any purpose. But, in order to acquire gold, one may acquire a specific object made of gold. For example, one may get a gold chain, use it for a specific purpose, and then forget that it is chain used for a purpose and look at it as just gold. One can simply look at it as gold that can be used for making so many things and fulfilling so many purposes.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n\nAnother question.
