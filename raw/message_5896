He\nasked, in broken English, &quot;Been India?&quot; Since I had been =\r\nin India for a\nnumber of years, the best, most easily demonstrable answer w=\r\nas to wobble my\nhead in the characteristic side to side manner known to mos=\r\nt Indians. The\nmoment he saw that &quot;wobble&quot;, he got a big grin on his face, =\r\nentered the\nroom, and closed the door behind him.\n\nHe asked me, &quot;Who you?&quot; =\r\nHaving lived in India and being used to this type of\nEnglish and being youn=\r\ng and polite I began to answer him, &quot;I am John\nGrimes,&quot; but just as I reach=\r\ned the G of Grimes, he said &quot;Bas, family name,\nwho you?&quot; (Bas is Hindi for =\r\n&quot;stop, enough.&quot;)\n\nAgain, since I have lived in India and studied Indian tho=\r\nught, I very\nconfidently and boldly began to reply, &quot;I am the immortal Atma=\r\nn,&quot; but just\nas I reached the A of Atman, again he stopped me with another =\r\n&quot;Bas, book\nname, who you?&quot; With the first &quot;stop&quot;, he wiped out my physical =\r\nbody. With\nthe second &quot;stop&quot;, he wiped out my entire mental universe.\n\nWhat=\r\n was left? With two small words, he had succeded in conveying to me that\nI =\r\nwas neither my physical body nor my mental knowledge. How to answer him?\nSo=\r\n I said, &quot;I do not know.&quot; Quick as a wink, he responded, &quot;Find out.&quot;\n\nI rep=\r\nlied, &quot;How?&quot; He responded, &quot;Not how, find out.&quot; Again I asked, &quot;How?&quot;\nHe wa=\r\ns holding a handkerchief in his hand and he opened his fingers and let\nthe =\r\nhandkerchief drop to the ground and as it fell he said, &quot;Let go.&quot; Again\nI a=\r\nsked, &quot;How [to let go]?&quot; He responded, &quot;Not how, let go.&quot; And then he\nturne=\r\nd and left the room.\n\nAlmost twenty years passed before I learned that this=\r\n monk supposedly did\nnot speak English. How interesting! A person who did n=\r\not speak English\nmagnificently managed to teach the Vedantic truth that one=\r\n is neither one&#39;s\nbody not one&#39;s thoughts, all in two words, As if that was=\r\n not enough, he\nproceeded to teach me how to &quot;find out who I really am&quot; wit=\r\nh another two\nwords (&quot;let go&quot;).\n\nWe all know how to let go, we do it every =\r\nnight when we go to sleep. We\nnever ask our mother, &quot;Mom, how do I go to sl=\r\neep?&quot; We just &quot;let go&quot; and\nsleep came. However, we become confused, disturb=\r\ned, when someone asks us to\n&quot;let go&quot; of out preconceived notions as to who =\r\nwe are.
