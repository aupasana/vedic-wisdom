For the daily ritual we do these in qui=\r\nck succession and may not realize the significance. If you take part in any=\r\n Temple/Diety consecration process each of these steps are elaborately done=\r\n. It is a different debate if any of us are really capable of such prANa pr=\r\natishTa but the steps are meant for that. \n\nSo, it is good to water the pla=\r\nnts with that in the Kalash. From time management p.o.v, may be you can col=\r\nlect everydays water into a bigger vessel and water the plants on weekends.=\r\n \n\nRegards,\n-Prasad\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Rama V&quot; &lt;vsra_pr=\r\nasad@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste - The present place I stay do not have cows ne=\r\narby ! The previous location I was at had a family that owned a cow and I c=\r\nould feed the bali (banana pieces) daily. I am offering raisins as bali and=\r\n even pigeons are not touching it. There are no sparrows (thanks to multipl=\r\ne base stations on apartments), else they would eat raisins. What are the o=\r\nther best alternatives for bali offering ? Can I offer sugar crystals and d=\r\nrop them near some plants on the ground for ants to eat ? For time being I =\r\nam saving the raisins and on a weekend I will find a cow on the road to fee=\r\nd them all along with non-bali bananas :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, I keep kalash as part=\r\n of the ritual and use it just to sprinkle water initially on all the homa =\r\nsamagri (havan items), but later the water goes to plants. Can I do away wi=\r\nth kalash completely and use my achamana cup water for the homa samagri sud=\r\ndhi ? The reason I ask is, pouring the water to plants, etc saves atleast 5=\r\n minutes and on working days, even that is good save.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lastly, can I co=\r\nver the homa kundam (havan kund) with a lid after I finish ? I do homam in =\r\nbalcony that is open and I donot want any dust, pigeon feathers, etc to fal=\r\nl into it. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you.\n&gt; \n&gt; regards\n&gt; rAma\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
