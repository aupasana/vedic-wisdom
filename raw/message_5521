If you kee=\r\np polluting the list with this attitude, I will have to ban you from the li=\r\nst. We welcome all views, but one can disagree with great scholars and mast=\r\ners without belittling them or adopting an all-knowing and dismissive attit=\r\nude.\n\nAadi Shankara was not anti Veda or anti grammar. In fact, if you stud=\r\ny his works, you will be amazed at some of the subtle technical nusances in=\r\n his commentaries, w.r.t. grammar. In terms of Sanskrit scholarship, schola=\r\nrship in Vedic scriptures, breadth of\n commentaries of Vedic literature and=\r\n the linguistic richness of compositions, Aadi Shankara stands tall among a=\r\nll scholars of Kali yuga so far. You cannot take one specific line about th=\r\ne importance of devotion out of context and portray the greatest and most p=\r\nrolific scholar of Kali yuga in an anti-scholarship light.\n\n* * *\n\nSanskrit=\r\n is a very useful language. So much great literature that shows various pat=\r\nhs to reaching god is available in Sanskrit language. Many Sanskrit mantras=\r\n directly resonate with the energy centers in one&#39;s subtle consciousness. S=\r\no, if one wants to learn Sanskrit or study various scriptures/classics in S=\r\nanskrit, it is a great idea.\n\nAt the same time, Shankara&#39;s advice of chanti=\r\nng the name of Govinda as grammar and other technicalities do not rescue on=\r\ne in the final moments, is a wise one. Devotion to personal god or *complet=\r\ne* surrender to personal or impersonal god is the thing that saves one in t=\r\nhe end.\n Learning various shastras, performing various rituals, disciplinin=\r\ng the mind with various activities, keeping the company of the saintly - al=\r\nl these are for the purpose of increasing devotion and surrender. Depending=\r\n on one&#39;s rinas and conditioning, one is bound to engage in various activit=\r\nies, such as learning Sanskrit, studying scriptures, saying prayers, doing =\r\nrituals etc. But, masters like Shankara remind one of the final goal, so th=\r\nat people do not forget it and get bogged down.\n\nIf one wanting to climb a =\r\nmountain keeps walking around the mountain to find the best path to climb, =\r\none may eventually forget that the goal is to climb the mountain and be stu=\r\nck at the base forever. Similarly, one who keeps learning this and that for=\r\never may forget that reaching god is the final goal and get stuck. So compa=\r\nssionate masters may sometimes remind us of the final goal.\n\n* * *\n\nI am re=\r\nminded of a small episode from the life of Swami\n Vivekananda.\n\nSwami Vivek=\r\nananda said at a San Francisco class: &quot;I am the disciple of a man who could=\r\n not write his own name, and I am not worthy to undo his shoes. How often h=\r\nave I wished I could take my intellect and throw it into the Ganges!&quot;\n\nStud=\r\nent said, &quot;But, Swami, that is the part of you I like best.&quot;\n\nSwami Vivekan=\r\nanda said, &quot;That is because you are a fool, Madam =E2=80=94 like I am.&quot;\n\nVi=\r\nvekananda was named so by Ramakrishna, not because he had viveka (discrimin=\r\nation) arising from a brilliant logical mind, but because TRUE viveka (disc=\r\nrimination) was to arise in his mind later and he was to realize the limita=\r\ntions of his regular viveka (discrimination of logical mind).\n\n* * *\n\n&gt; Tha=\r\nt Adi shankara is celebrated in a relatively few quarters around the world,=\r\n\n&gt; does speak a lot about his immaturity in disseminating his teachings in =\r\na\n&gt; useful manner.\n\nMaturity of a teacher is not measured by the\n following=\r\n. And great teachers do not care about being &quot;celebrated&quot;.\n\nIn any case, it=\r\n is not true that Adi Shankara is not well-celebrated. A significant percen=\r\ntage of Vedanta scholarship of the last 2 millennia is influenced heavily b=\r\ny Adi Shankara&#39;s commentaries. He shaped the thinking of Indian philosopher=\r\ns for many many generations.\n\nApart from his scholarly works, the mutts est=\r\nablished by him have shaped the religious consciousness of a significant pe=\r\nrcentage of Hindus in the last couple of millennia.\n\nAny teachings in writt=\r\nen/spoken words can never be perfect and perish quickly. The words of great=\r\n great teachers also lose their meaning and relevance very quickly. Only th=\r\ne teachings of rishis and gods retain their meaning and their ability to in=\r\nfluence the thinking of people forever (or for really long periods). Adi Sh=\r\nankara&#39;s words - scholarly works as well as composed prayers - have retaine=\r\nd their meaning and power for more than\n a couple of millennia. The longevi=\r\nty of his works is amazing.\n\n* * *\n\nIt is ok to have strong opinions. As pe=\r\nople&#39;s understanding evolves, their opinions evolve too. So, wise ones try =\r\nnot to offend others with their strong opinions. In any case, insulting sai=\r\nnts, avataras of gods and rishis, based on half-baked understanding of thei=\r\nr teachings, is not good karma.

If you keep polluting the list with this attitud=\r\ne, I will have to ban you from the list. We welcome all views, but one can =\r\ndisagree with great scholars and masters without belittling them or adoptin=\r\ng an all-knowing and dismissive attitude.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aadi Shankara was not anti=\r\n Veda or anti grammar. In fact, if you study his works, you will be amazed =\r\nat some of the subtle technical nusances in his commentaries, w.r.t. gramma=\r\nr. In terms of Sanskrit scholarship, scholarship in Vedic scriptures, bread=\r\nth of\n commentaries of Vedic literature and the linguistic richness of comp=\r\nositions, Aadi Shankara stands tall among all scholars of Kali yuga so far.=\r\n You cannot take one specific line about the importance of devotion out of =\r\ncontext and portray the greatest and most prolific scholar of Kali yuga in =\r\nan anti-scholarship light.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sanskrit is a very useful la=\r\nnguage. So much great literature that shows various paths to reaching god i=\r\ns available in Sanskrit language. Many Sanskrit mantras directly resonate w=\r\nith the energy centers in one&#39;s subtle consciousness. So, if one wants to l=\r\nearn Sanskrit or study various scriptures/classics in Sanskrit, it is a gre=\r\nat idea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the same time, Shankara&#39;s advice of chanting the name of=\r\n Govinda as grammar and other technicalities do not rescue one in the final=\r\n moments, is a wise one. Devotion to personal god or *complete* surrender t=\r\no personal or impersonal god is the thing that saves one in the end.\n Learn=\r\ning various shastras, performing various rituals, disciplining the mind wit=\r\nh various activities, keeping the company of the saintly - all these are fo=\r\nr the purpose of increasing devotion and surrender. Depending on one&#39;s rina=\r\ns and conditioning, one is bound to engage in various activities, such as l=\r\nearning Sanskrit, studying scriptures, saying prayers, doing rituals etc. B=\r\nut, masters like Shankara remind one of the final goal, so that people do n=\r\not forget it and get bogged down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If one wanting to climb a mountain=\r\n keeps walking around the mountain to find the best path to climb, one may =\r\neventually forget that the goal is to climb the mountain and be stuck at th=\r\ne base forever. Similarly, one who keeps learning this and that forever may=\r\n forget that reaching god is the final goal and get stuck. So compassionate=\r\n masters may sometimes remind us of the final goal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I a=\r\nm reminded of a small episode from the life of Swami\n Vivekananda.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;S=\r\nwami Vivekananda said at a San Francisco class: &quot;I am the disciple of a man=\r\n who could not write his own name, and I am not worthy to undo his shoes. H=\r\now often have I wished I could take my intellect and throw it into the Gang=\r\nes!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student said, &quot;But, Swami, that is the part of you I like best.=\r\n&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Swami Vivekananda said, &quot;That is because you are a fool, Madam =E2=\r\n=80=94 like I am.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vivekananda was named so by Ramakrishna, not beca=\r\nuse he had viveka (discrimination) arising from a brilliant logical mind, b=\r\nut because TRUE viveka (discrimination) was to arise in his mind later and =\r\nhe was to realize the limitations of his regular viveka (discrimination of =\r\nlogical mind).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; That Adi shankara is celebrated in =\r\na relatively few quarters around the world,&lt;br&gt;&gt; does speak a lot about =\r\nhis immaturity in disseminating his teachings in a&lt;br&gt;&gt; useful manner.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maturity of a teacher is not measured by the\n following. And great te=\r\nachers do not care about being &quot;celebrated&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In any case, it is not =\r\ntrue that Adi Shankara is not well-celebrated. A significant percentage of =\r\nVedanta scholarship of the last 2 millennia is influenced heavily by Adi Sh=\r\nankara&#39;s commentaries. He shaped the thinking of Indian philosophers for ma=\r\nny many generations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apart from his scholarly works, the mutts estab=\r\nlished by him have shaped the religious consciousness of a significant perc=\r\nentage of Hindus in the last couple of millennia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any teachings in w=\r\nritten/spoken words can never be perfect and perish quickly. The words of g=\r\nreat great teachers also lose their meaning and relevance very quickly. Onl=\r\ny the teachings of rishis and gods retain their meaning and their ability t=\r\no influence the thinking of people forever (or for really long periods). Ad=\r\ni Shankara&#39;s words - scholarly works as well as composed prayers - have ret=\r\nained their meaning and power for more than\n a couple of millennia. The lon=\r\ngevity of his works is amazing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is ok to have strong=\r\n opinions. As people&#39;s understanding evolves, their opinions evolve too. So=\r\n, wise ones try not to offend others with their strong opinions. In any cas=\r\ne, insulting saints, avataras of gods and rishis, based on half-baked under=\r\nstanding of their teachings, is not good karma.
