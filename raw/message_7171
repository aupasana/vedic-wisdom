The answer to this question,my dear, is best left to experience it y=\r\nourself. Why? Because words can&#39;t describe it......\n\nAtleast, this has been=\r\n my insight & experience. Maybe Narasimhaji can better explain it.\n\nOm Tat =\r\nSat Brahmaarpanamastu\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;priya_moks=\r\nha&quot; &lt;priya_moksha@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hiramalini ji,\n&gt; I&#39;ll answer the 1s=\r\nt part of your question - Can women do tarpanam? What a coincidence that yo=\r\nu ask the very question I asked myself few months ago...I&#39;m speaking from m=\r\ny personal experience and will defer to Narasimhaji for the final answer.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; I wear rudhraksha & some months later after wearing the rudhrakshas, wh=\r\nile praying, I had asked God for guidance=85.I remembered listening to stor=\r\nies of Sage Agastiar while growing up & had thought,&quot; I have no one to guid=\r\ne me, I don&#39;t know the path to moksha or whatever-is-the-highest-truth=85.I=\r\n&#39;ve had enough of ridicule from my family for my beliefs.... So, just so th=\r\nat I don&#39;t waste anymore of my energy in justifying my beliefs, I seek guid=\r\nance from Sage Agastiar=85At least scriptures say that he was a great sage =\r\n& if anyone needs to argue, they can argue with the scriptures&quot;=85=85So men=\r\ntally, I would pray to Sage Agastiar and say &quot;I don&#39;t know the mantras, puj=\r\na methods etc to pray to you=85.All that I know, is your name and that&#39;s al=\r\nl I can chant=85and I would chant his name 9 times=85&quot;=85Few months later, =\r\nmy family took part in Dattatreya abishekam at the St. Louis Hindu temple i=\r\nn MO and still few months later, I landed up on Dr. Pillai&#39;s website and hi=\r\nm being Sage Agastiar in an earlier lifetime [according to the ancient naad=\r\ni leaves], kind-of-agreed with my earlier request-for-guidance=85\n&gt; \n&gt; Earl=\r\nier during this year, I had again & again come across articles on Dr. Pilla=\r\ni&#39;s website that stresses the importance of tharpanam=85 &quot;If I have to reco=\r\nmmend one solution for every one of our problems, be it financial, relation=\r\nship or health, it is doing Tarpanam. Miracles do happen after the performa=\r\nnce of the rituals&quot;, says Dr. Pillai=85\n&gt; More info can be found here \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n http://www.pillaicenter.com/shopping/ShopEvents.aspx?categ=3Dsearch&search=\r\n=3Dtarpanam\n&gt; \n&gt; I had also read on the Agasthiar website the importance of=\r\n tharpanam=85\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.agasthiar.org/a/tharpanam.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; I wrote to=\r\n both these groups & received positive feedbacks & comments about the exper=\r\nience of people after they did daily tarpanam.\n&gt; \n&gt; I had asked God for con=\r\nfirmation and though I don&#39;t want to mention right now what confirmation I =\r\ngot, I think it is suffice to say that I got my answer.So, I started doing =\r\ndaily tarpanam as shown in these videos\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\r\n=3DNlFEo7IWeGY&feature=3Demail\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DdAxDFL=\r\nHWoNU&feature=3Demail\n&gt; \n&gt; Nothing short of miracles have happened since. M=\r\ny parents are alive & they do the monthly amavasya tharpanam for my paterna=\r\nl grandparents. I had infact asked my thatha & paati [my paternal grandpare=\r\nnts who are dead] for confirmation & they too have sent me confirmations [w=\r\nhich right now, I dont want to go into the details].....Every aspect of my =\r\nlife has improved - spiritual, relationships, finance etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, my answ=\r\ner to your question? Do it...Ask God for your own &#39;personalized answers/con=\r\nfirmation&#39; and when you get them, you will know the answer yourself and it =\r\nbecomes &#39;YOUR TRUTH&#39;....Not something that some &#39;online-stranger-you-dont-e=\r\nven-know&#39; asked you to do.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this answers your question.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --=\r\n- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;hiramalini&quot; &lt;hiramalini@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Namaste, PVR Narasimhaji !
