Some of these were translated and published by Sri\nRamanasramam in =\r\nRamana Smriti in 1980. The following is another from this\ncollection that w=\r\nas translated from Telugu by &#39;SRJ&#39; and published in Ramana\nJyothi, a journa=\r\nl of the Sri Ramana Kendram of Hyderabad. Rangaswamy was an\nattendant of Bh=\r\nagavan and can be seen walking behind the Maharshi in the\narchival film foo=\r\ntage.\n\nMy parents were farmers and my village is thirty miles from Tiruvann=\r\namalai.\nYearning for male progeny my mother and father offered prayers to L=\r\nord\nVinayaka. Thereafter, I and my younger brother were born.\n\nIn my twenti=\r\neth year, I came to know that the Kartikai Festival in\nTiruvannamalai was a=\r\n grand affair. I became restless with a longing to see\nit and left home for=\r\n Arunachala. The night before I left I had a dream of a\nsannyasin clad in o=\r\nnly a loin cloth and surrounded by brahmacharins.\nAdjacent to the hill was =\r\nhis hermitage where he gave me darshan seated on a\ntiger&#39;s skin.\n\nThe next =\r\nday I started off for Arunachala, but was not used to walking long\ndistance=\r\ns. I stopped in a village on the way and went to the house of a\nfamily I kn=\r\new. When they saw my haggard looks they restrained me from\ncontinuing. I wa=\r\ns locked in a room.\n\nThe time of the festival was running out. Because of m=\r\ny persistent demands I\nwas finally released. Only two hours were left befor=\r\ne the lighting of the\ndeepam (light) on the hill and I had yet fifteen mile=\r\ns to cover. In a\nfrenzy, totally unconscious of my body, I ran. I felt as i=\r\nf I floated in the\nair. I reached Arunachala at 5:30 p.m. and had darshan o=\r\nf the deepam when it\nwas lit at 6 p.m. Afterwards I went to the Esanya Mutt=\r\n and the people there\nwelcomed me and asked me to stay.\n\nThe next morning I=\r\n started off for giripradakshina of Arunachala. Sri\nRamanasramam was on the=\r\n way and, as everyone was going into the Ashrama to\nhave darshan of Bhagava=\r\nn, I followed. The moment I saw him I was overcome\nwith emotion and cried o=\r\nut, &quot;When will I be rid of this bondage?&quot; I was\nvisibly shaken. Bhagavan ki=\r\nndly gestured to me that I should sit. I sat down\nfor an hour and was uncon=\r\nscious of my body. I had an urge to stay on there\nand asked Chinnaswami (th=\r\ne Ashrama manager) for permission. He said, &quot;You\nare young. What can you do=\r\n? Go back home.&quot; But I did not leave. I said,\n&quot;Please give me any work. Bha=\r\ngavan will give me the strength.&quot; As I would\nnot leave,Chinnaswami relented=\r\n and finally asked me to remove the weeds from\nthe flower garden. With much=\r\n enthusiasm I did the work of two people.\nBhagavan also praised my work.\n\nI=\r\n would daily attend to the work given to me and when free would sit in\nmedi=\r\ntation. That was my only routine. One day I asked Bhagavan, &quot;Swami, what\nis=\r\n the way to salvation?&quot;\n\n&quot;The way you came,&quot; was his simple reply.\n\nThe mom=\r\nent I heard him say this my mind froze. He then asked me to read a\nverse fr=\r\nom Upadesa Saram.\n\nLater I was given the job of making garlands for the tem=\r\nple deities. Around\nthe same time they were constructing a platform in the =\r\nAshrama. All of us\nwere carrying stones. Sri Bhagavan too carried them with=\r\n us. My finger got\ncrushed under a stone, and until the finger healed, Bhag=\r\navan made the\ngarlands on my behalf.\n\nLater I was made an attendant to Bhag=\r\navan. Me and Madhavaswami were his\nattendants. One time both of us were giv=\r\nen damaged copies of Ramana Vijayam\nfor reading. My copy did not contain al=\r\nl the pages. Bhagavan asked me to\nhand copy those pages, but I could not fi=\r\nnd the time to do it. One day he\nasked me, &quot;Have you copied those pages?&quot;\n\n=\r\n&quot;I am not finding time,&quot; I said.\n\n&quot;What are you doing now?&quot; he asked.\n\n&quot;I a=\r\nm going to Pallakottu to wash your loin cloth.&quot;\n\n&quot;All right. You do my work=\r\n and I will do your work.&quot; Saying this he copied\nall the pages for me.\n\nTho=\r\nse days when any offering was made it was distributed then and there.\nAnts,=\r\n squirrels, cats, dogs, cows, children and adults were fed. There was\nno co=\r\nncept of storing for the morrow.\n\nOne day, Bhagavan, while cooking in the k=\r\nitchen, asked me to put some oil in\na ladle. Some of the oil spilled out on=\r\nto the floor. He massaged all that\noil on my body and said, &quot;Go have your b=\r\nath.&quot;\n\nAnother day the district collector came from Vellore to see Bhagavan=\r\n. The\nlittle squirrels were close by in their nest. A cat swallowed their m=\r\nother. The\nresponsibility of looking after them now fell on Bhagavan. He sa=\r\nid, &quot;These\nchildren do not know that it is to their advantage if they confi=\r\nne\nthemselves to their nest. All the problems are outside, but they cannot\n=\r\nresist the temptation of going out. Similarly, if the mind settles down in\n=\r\nthe Heart without straying out, there is no problem. But it cannot help\ngoi=\r\nng out.&quot;\n\n&quot;What is the method of restraining it?&quot; I asked.\n\n&quot;Just the same =\r\nas I am doing here: Whenever the squirrels come out, I put\nthem back. The m=\r\nore we put them back they stay put. Then we can relax.&quot;\n\nMy parents began t=\r\no search for me since I did not return the day after\nKartikai Deepam. After=\r\n a year had passed, they finally found me at Sri\nRamanasramam. They came an=\r\nd wept before Bhagavan.\n\n&quot;If he goes with you, then take him. Why cry befor=\r\ne me?&quot; said Bhagavan. But\nI refused to go.\n\n&quot;We did a lot of penance to beg=\r\net him. The same Lord who gave him to us took\nhim back again for his servic=\r\ne,&quot; they said, and then left the place.\n\nAfter a few years I had an urge to=\r\n go to Kashi. When I mentioned this to\nBhagavan, he said, &quot;&#39;Ka-shi&#39; -- if y=\r\nou forget those two letters, this itself\nis Kashi.&quot;\n\n&quot;I am unable to forget=\r\n, Swami&quot; I said.\n\n&quot;All right, fulfil your desire,&quot; said Bhagavan.\n\nBut Chin=\r\nnaswami refused to allow me to go, but I still went. Devotees\ncontributed f=\r\nunds for my expenses. I returned after three months, but\nChinnaswami refuse=\r\nd to admit me into the Ashrama.\n\n&quot;He is like that,&quot; Bhagavan said to Chinna=\r\nswami. Then he admitted me.\n\nOne evening Bhagavan was coming down the hill.=\r\n I was walking behind him. A\njanitor offered his salutations to Bhagavan. B=\r\nhagavan said, &quot;If you do your\nwork with care, that itself is salutations.&quot; =\r\nWhen Bhagavan went into the\nhall all the people stood up and some prostrate=\r\nd. When all of them settled\ndown, Bhagavan asked me to relate what had happ=\r\nened on the hill and what he\ntold that janitor.\n\nBhagavan then said, &quot;These=\r\n sittings, standings and salutations are not real\nmarks of respect. Doing o=\r\nne&#39;s job with the utmost care is the real\nsalutation.&quot;\n\nShantamma was a coo=\r\nk in the Ashrama. She derived satisfaction only when she\nserved Bhagavan wi=\r\nth her own hands. She used to serve Bhagavan before\nserving everyone else. =\r\nBhagavan was patient with her for a long time. Finally\nhe said, &quot;Swamy does=\r\n not reside just in this body. He is present in every\none of the devotees. =\r\nThis Swamy will be happy if he is served only after\neverybody else is serve=\r\nd.&quot;\n\nOne evening me and Bhagavan were going up the hill. Mr. Chadwick was r=\r\nocking\non a chair in his verandah when he called out to me by clapping his =\r\nhands.\nBhagavan inquired as to what the matter was about. I briefly explain=\r\ned. In\nreply he said, &quot;This is how the Westerners increase their needs. How=\r\n\ncomfortable it will be if we spread a mat and squat on it.&quot;\n\nOnce the othe=\r\nr attendant, Madhavaswami, had to undergo surgery in one of his\nears. At th=\r\nat time I had to do the all the work of giving Bhagavan a bath,\ndistributin=\r\ng offerings, going up the hill with the Swamy, keeping vigil in\nthe night, =\r\netc. Consequently, because of the strain, I became unwell. I\nexplained this=\r\n to Bhagavan. Then, soon after, I was massaging Bhagavan&#39;s\nfeet.Bhagavan th=\r\nen massaged my abdomen with his foot. Immediately, my\nillness vanished and =\r\nI was infused with unusual strength. Henceforth, I was\nenabled to do the en=\r\ntire work effortlessly until Madhavaswami recovered.\n\nSource: http://www.ar=\r\nunachala.org/newsletters/1997/?pg=3Dmay-jun\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=\r\n=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=\r\n=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=\r\n=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0016e65ae56a3fa7f90489e888b7\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nSri Chelam from Andhra Pradesh interviewed a number of devotees =\r\nof Sri Bhagavan who had long-standing association with Him and compiled the=\r\nir reminiscences.

How comfortable it=\r\n will be if we spread a mat and squat on it.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Once the=\r\n=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;other attendant, Madhavaswami, had t=\r\no undergo surgery&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0in one of his ears. At that time I had to do =\r\nthe all the work of giving Bhagavan a bath, distributing offerings, going u=\r\np the hill with the Swamy, keeping vigil in the night, etc.=C2=A0&lt;span styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Consequently, because of the strain, I became unwell=\r\n.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0I explained this to Bhagavan. Then, soon after, I was massagi=\r\nng Bhagavan&#39;s feet.&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Bhagavan then massa=\r\nged my abdomen with his foot. Immediately, my illness vanished and I was in=\r\nfused with unusual strength.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0Henceforth, I was enabled to do th=\r\ne entire work effortlessly until Madhavaswami recovered.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.arunachala.org=\r\n/newsletters/1997/?pg=3Dmay-jun&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.arunachala.or=\r\ng/newsletters/1997/?pg=3Dmay-jun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:both;margin-top:0px=\r\n;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n=\r\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:87%;margin-top:0=\r\npx;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82 =C2=A0=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=\r\n=8B =C2=A0=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=\r\n=AF =C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=\r\n=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D =C2=A0=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=81 =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--0016e65ae56a3fa7f90489e888b7--\r\n\n"}}
