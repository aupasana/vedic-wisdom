You need to work out how many repetitions y=\r\nou can do in one hour, and how many hours japa you can do. I would keep a d=\r\niary and a careful record of how many malas you do every day.\n\nYou can gaug=\r\ne your capacity now before Navaratri....work out the maximum number of mala=\r\ns you can do in one day....and then see if the purascharana is possible.\n\nS=\r\nome people do a shorter anusthana in 9 days, which is supposed to be a mini=\r\nmum of one lakh. This is also tremendously effective. \n\nPerhaps you could d=\r\no one lakh japa of Gayatri in 9 days. And then, if interested, continue the=\r\n japa (at a reduced or same number of malas per day) for a longer period wi=\r\nth the aim of doing a full purascharana. \n\nMy purascharana of the Om Namo N=\r\narayanaya mantra is going to take me nearly two years because of my work co=\r\nmmitments. A purascharana is ideally to be done while following certain rul=\r\nes to maximise benefit (eg solitude, strict sattvic diet etc). It is not pr=\r\nactical for me to follow these rules all the time due to work and home cond=\r\nitions, though I do my best. Despite this I am doing it anyway.... I was en=\r\ncouraged to do so by a disciple of Swami Sivananda at the Rishikesh Ashram,=\r\n who basically said &quot;do what you can&quot; and &quot;something is better than nothing=\r\n&quot;. \n\nAs Sivananda says, an ounce of practice is worth tons of theory. \n\nThi=\r\ns is a very helpful article by Swami Chidananda (disciple of Sivananda). At=\r\n the bottom of the page you will find an excellent timetable showing precis=\r\nely how many days it can take to do purascharana of different mantras. \n\nht=\r\ntp://www.dlshq.org/download/initiates.htm\n\nAll the very best. \n\nAparna \n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jha.dolly&quot; &lt;jha.dolly@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; dear narasimha ji and spiritual siblings,\n&gt; \n&gt; this time during the 9 da=\r\nys of durga pooja i wish to\n&gt; do a purashcharan of gayatri mantra. \n&gt; \n&gt; an=\r\nd, it would be kind of you to share with me some tips and also guide me in =\r\nthe same.\n&gt; \n&gt; since it is going to be a physically taxing task and very ti=\r\nme consuming how can i prepare myself for the same.\n&gt; \n&gt; also, if you think=\r\n gayatri mantra purashcharan will not be possible\n&gt; (being a grihastha time=\r\n is a major constraint and gayatri being a long mantra)then please suggest =\r\nsome other devi mantra that i can safely complete during the said duration.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; looking forward to getting guidance from you.\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks n rgds,\n&gt; d=\r\nolly.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
