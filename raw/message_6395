Suppose\n&gt; &gt; yo=\r\nu are eating food. Think of food as an aspect of god. Be grateful to it\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n and consume it with reverence and a sense of sacredness. Suppose you are\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; discussing something with a friend. Think of the friend as an aspect of =\r\ngod\n&gt; &gt; and deal with him with a sense of sacredness. Suppose you are writi=\r\nng a\n&gt; &gt; software program on the computer. Think of the computer and the wo=\r\nrk you do\n&gt; &gt; as an aspect of god and approach it with reverence and a sens=\r\ne of\n&gt; &gt; sacredness. This attitude can be extended to every activity.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; When you do homam, think that god is indeed in the fire. Be thankful to\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; fire and to god. Whatever you offer and chant, do it with feeling. If y=\r\nou\n&gt; &gt; start identifying god in every perception, thought and action and br=\r\ning\n&gt; &gt; awareness of god to every moment of your life, you will realize the=\r\n infinite\n&gt; &gt; nature of god and love, devotion and surrender will automatic=\r\nally come.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
