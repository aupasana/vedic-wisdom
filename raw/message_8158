Currently, all the four membe=\r\nrs of my family are running bad period such as Sade sati, arthashtama sani =\r\nand kantaka shani.\n\nOne of shani upasaka suggested to my husband to perform=\r\n shani Japa during night times at any place other than home. He starts at a=\r\nbout 10:00 PM, draws something on the floor and performs Japa for 4-5 hrs a=\r\nnd goes to temple next day morning before coming home. I am confused on thi=\r\ns procedure.\n\nmy question is:\n\nWhy should we perform shani Japa at night ti=\r\nmes only? I am suggesting him to do at day times in a shiva temple.\nIs ther=\r\ne a method for shani worship written in any scriptures?\nCan we perform shan=\r\ni homa?\n\nPlease provide me some insights, as I am not comfortable with him =\r\nperforming Pooja at night times.\n\nThanks all\nVasavi\nSent from my iPad\n"}}
