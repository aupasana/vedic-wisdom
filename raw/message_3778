As it was too hot to return to Skandashram a small hut=\r\n was built\nwhich was used for cooking and the return journey to the Ashram =\r\nwas delayed\nuntil the evening. Eventually Chinnaswami decided to stay there=\r\n permanently\nand lived in the hut along with Dandapaniswami.Due to the fact=\r\n that some of\nthe food now had to be brought here, there was at times not e=\r\nnough to eat in\nSkandashram. This led to differences of opinion,which Sri R=\r\namana settled\nwith his usual diplomacy.\n\nSri Ramana=E2=80=99s followers soo=\r\nn noticed that he visited his mother=E2=80=99s samadhi\neach day. They there=\r\nfore started to wait for him there. One day he was\ninvited to a lavish meal=\r\n by a devotee. A large number of townspeople also\nturned up and the meal tu=\r\nrned into a feast which continued into the evening.\nAs nightfall had set in=\r\n, Ramana was unable to return to Skandashram, so he\nremained at the foot of=\r\n the hill overnight. The following day the same thing\nhappened again. In ad=\r\ndition, Ganapati Muni had joined them and gave an\nenthralling lecture which=\r\n lasted late into the night. Over the days that\nfollowed Sri Ramana was alw=\r\nays detained for some reason until it was too\nlate to return to Skandashram=\r\n.\n\nFinally Kunju Swami and Gopal Rao were asked to look after Skandashram. =\r\nFor\na week they waited for Ramana=E2=80=99s return in vain.As they did not =\r\nlike to stay\nup there without their master they came back down and from tha=\r\nt time on the\nAshram was left empty. A short time later the deserted Ashram=\r\n was broken\ninto.Amongst other things the thieves removed a clock and a woo=\r\nden plank\nwhich Ramana had used. When he heard about it, he said,=E2=80=9CI=\r\nt is good. Nobody\nneed go there to look after the place anymore.=E2=80=9D\n\n=\r\nThis marked the beginning of Ramanashram. Sri Ramana once expressed it thus=\r\n,\n=E2=80=9CThe same shakti (power) that had brought me from Madurai to Tiru=\r\nvannamalai\nbrought me down here from the hill.=E2=80=9D\n\nIn the early years=\r\n Ramanashram consisted of just a few huts. The so-called\nOld Hall, in which=\r\n Sri Ramana lived day and night until 1949, was built in\n1928. It was here =\r\nthat the many meetings with visitors and devotees took\nplace. The Old Hall,=\r\n which measures 40 feet by 15, is not very spacious and\ncontains only Raman=\r\na=E2=80=99s sofa and some bookcases.\n\nThe impression which is sometimes giv=\r\nen, that the Ashram came into being\naround the Maharshi without his partici=\r\npation, is therefore absolutely\nwrong, as Annamalai testified, =E2=80=9CIt =\r\nwas Bhagavan, and Bhagavan alone, who\ndecided when buildings should be buil=\r\nt, where they should be built, on what\nscale they should be constructed,wha=\r\nt materials should be used, and who\nshould be in charge of the construction=\r\n.=E2=80=9D\n\nSri Ramana not only took great interest in the various building=\r\n works, gave\nadvice and instructions and each evening asked for a progress =\r\nreport from\nAnnamalai Swami, he also liked to participate in the work himse=\r\nlf. He\nevidently felt more comfortable on the building site outside, than o=\r\nn his\ncouch. He would have liked to have participated more fully in this ph=\r\nysical\nwork, if only his devotees had allowed him. But they thought it\ninap=\r\npropriate for him to do strenuous physical labour. In addition, he also\nhad=\r\n to care for the increasing numbers of visitors, who often came from afar\nf=\r\nor the sole purpose of having his darshan. Once when he was visiting the\nbu=\r\nilding site, his attendant Madhava Swami announced the arrival of new\nvisit=\r\nors, Sri Ramana replied jokingly that a new warrant had been issued for\nhis=\r\n arrest and it was now time for him to return to jail.\n\nOne of the most imp=\r\nortant and lengthy building projects was the erection of\nthe new temple ove=\r\nr the mother=E2=80=99s samadhi. The project was started on 1st\nSeptember 19=\r\n39, exactly 43 years after Sri Ramana=E2=80=99s arrival at\nTiruvannamalai. =\r\nAgain he showed great interest in the construction work.\nExceptionally it w=\r\nas not he who did the drawings but a master temple\nbuilder, who brought wit=\r\nh him several stonemasons experienced in temple\nconstruction.\n\nThe temple b=\r\nuilding placed an enormous strain on the Ashram finances.\nChinnaswami obtai=\r\nned the best teak wood from Burma and wanted to use only\nthe highest qualit=\r\ny material. At times there was not enough money to pay the\nworkers, but the=\r\nn, unexpectedly,donations would be received.\n\nFeroza Taleyarkhan, a member =\r\nof an aristocratic Parsi family,reports how she\nraised considerable funds f=\r\nor the mother=E2=80=99s temple and the New Hall on behalf\nof Chinnaswami. R=\r\namana, however,was insistent that the collections should\nnot be done in his=\r\n name.\n\nFeroza Taleyarkhan also played an important role in the renovation =\r\nof the\nPatala Lingam and in the purchase of Ramana=E2=80=99s birth house in=\r\n Tiruchuli\n(Sundaram Mandiram) and the house in Madurai (Ramana Mandiram) t=\r\nhrough\nRamanashram.\n\nThe construction of the temple took nearly 10 years. I=\r\nt was called\nMathrubhuteswara (God in the form of the mother) and was cerem=\r\nonially opened\nin March 1949. The official ceremony (kumbhabhishekam) laste=\r\nd for four days.\nOn the last evening but one before the feast, the Sri Chak=\r\nra Meru was\ninstalled in the inner shrine.\n\nMajor Chadwick reports how Rama=\r\nna himself supervised the installation,=E2=80=9CIt\nwas an extremely hot nig=\r\nht and with three charcoal retorts for melting the\ncement adding to the hea=\r\nt, it must have been intolerable inside the airless\ncave of the inner shrin=\r\ne, but for about an hour and a half Bhagavan sat\nthere telling the workmen =\r\nwhat to do. On the last night of the function he\nwent in procession,opening=\r\n the doors of the New Hall and temple and passing\nstraight up into the Inne=\r\nr Shrine, where he stood for some five minutes with\nboth hands laid on the =\r\nSri Chakra in blessing.=E2=80=9D\n\nSource: Ramana Maharshi: His Life A biogr=\r\naphy by Gabriele Ebert\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B=\r\n  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=\r\n=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=\r\n=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd1b3c8a8b055047fb367ac\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Puja was performed regularly ea=\r\nch day at Alagammal=E2=80=99s tomb (samadhi), ending at midday.
