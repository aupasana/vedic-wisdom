In the\nlas=\r\nt two years since its initial publication, Dr. Morales&#39; work\non &quot;Radical Un=\r\niversalism&quot; has been read by over one-million readers,\ntranslated into a ha=\r\nlf dozen languages, published in over a dozen\nperiodicals, appeared on hund=\r\nreds of websites, and changed the way\nthe world views Sanatana Dharma forev=\r\ner!\n\nNow a new, expanded edition of this work has been published in India\nb=\r\ny the Voice of India publishing company. With a powerful forward by\nDr. Dav=\r\nid Frawley, and endorsements by dozens of the world&#39;s most\nimportant Hindu =\r\nleaders, this new book edition of Dr. Morales&#39; work\nis destined to reach an=\r\n even broader audience.\n\nTo order your copy today, please send a check or m=\r\noney order payable\nto &quot;Dr. Frank Morales&quot; for US$11 to:\n\nDr. Frank Morales\n=\r\n14455 Harrison Street, Suite 311\nOmaha, NE, USA 68138\n\n\n&quot;Few have the backg=\r\nround and fewer still the courage to speak boldly\nabout the unfortunate asc=\r\nension in modern times of Hindu universalism.\nSri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya=\r\n has both, and wields them in this book\nto trenchant purpose. Anyone seekin=\r\ng to comprehend the origins and\nintellectual dangers of an &quot;all religions a=\r\nre the same&quot; mind-set need\nlook no further. It&#39;s all flayed open here, logi=\r\ncally and compellingly.&quot;\n\nParamacharya Palaniswami\nEditor-in-Chief\nHinduism=\r\n Today Magazine\n\n\n&quot;Radical Universalism&quot; by Dr. Frank Morales is an importa=\r\nnt essay that\ndispels many misconceptions about the Hindu tradition. Sanata=\r\nna Dharma\nemphatically speaks of the difference between the asuric and the\n=\r\ndaivika currents of reality and the need to choose the latter if one\nwishes=\r\n to obtain knowledge and understanding. Dr Morales is right to\nstress that =\r\nthe slogan that &quot;all religions are the same&quot; is\nantithetical to the spirit =\r\nof the Vedas. Progress, at the personal and\nthe societal levels, comes only=\r\n through a process of churning. I\nrecommend this book very strongly.&quot;\n\nProf=\r\nessor Subhash Kak\nAuthor of &quot;The Prajna Sutra, The Astronomical Code of the=\r\n Rgveda&quot;, and\nmany other books.\n\n\n&quot;In this book, Dharma teacher Sri Dharma =\r\nPravartaka Acharya\n(American-born Dr. Frank Morales) develops a cogent argu=\r\nment against\nthe universalistic fallacy. He traces its origins in the colon=\r\nial\ncondition, when prominent Hindus interiorized this novel European\nidea,=\r\n and documents its lightning career through divergent sections of\nHindu soc=\r\niety including such seeming antagonists as Gandhism and Hindu\nnationalism. =\r\nHe draws attention to the odd sense of superiority which\nsome preachers der=\r\nive from the allegedly Hindu teaching that &quot;unlike\nother religions, Hinduis=\r\nm doesn&#39;t claim to be unlike other religions&quot;.\nThen he proceeds to deconstr=\r\nuct this fashionable rhetoric about the\nequal truth of all religions. With =\r\ncompelling logic, he shows its\ncontradictions as well as its undesirable et=\r\nhical implications. Not\nleast, he proves that it is deeply un-Hindu, for Hi=\r\nnduism values truth\nover syrupy and futile attempts to please everyone.&quot;\n\nD=\r\nr. Koenraad Elst\nBelgian Indologist\n\n\n\n\n2.

To be\nre=\r\nleased April 23, 2008.)\n\n\n_________________________________________________=\r\n___________\n\n\nThe Rishi Phenomenon\nSri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya\n(Dr. Frank=\r\n Morales, Ph.D.)\n\n(The following is an excerpt from Dr. Frank Morales&#39; fort=\r\nhcoming book\n&quot;Whisperings of the Divine: How God is Known in the Vedic Trad=\r\nition.&quot;)\n\n\nThe rishi phenomenon is an instance of a human being who, throug=\r\nh the\nallied processes of yoga, tapas (vows of austerity), sadhanas\n(system=\r\natic spiritual disciplines), intense meditation (dhyana), and\nother esoteri=\r\nc means of systematic self-purification, has achieved\nabsolute transcendenc=\r\ne over the non-atman (non-spiritual) aspects of\nherself. Having gained comp=\r\nlete control over the body, mind, speech,\nand senses, the rishi becomes tra=\r\nnsformed into a being who is\nthoroughly absorbed in the spiritual reality. =\r\nBeing thus absorbed,\nshe has a direct and unmediated experiential connectio=\r\nn with the\ntruth. In the terminology of Yoga philosophy, such a state is kn=\r\nown\nas samadhi, or perfect meditative absorption.\n\nThe samadhi state is one=\r\n of enstasy, in which the individual undergoes\nthe experience of standing w=\r\nithin her true self and tasting the bliss\nof her own inner reality. From th=\r\nis trans-material perspective within\nthe samadhi state, the yogi and the Ab=\r\nsolute - the subjective\nexperiencer and the transcendent object of the expe=\r\nrience - become\nintimately reunited. &quot;Experience is synonymous with reality=\r\n&quot;, says\nMahanamabrata, &quot;which is to be analyzed, synthesized and plunged in=\r\nto,\nso that its ultimate nature may be immediately apprehended.&quot; (3) There\n=\r\nare two different levels of samadhi that the yogi undergoes in her\nattempt =\r\nto realize the ultimate truth. The first of these is\nsavikalpa-samadhi, in =\r\nwhich the yogi begins to identify with the\nessence of the Absolute. At the =\r\nhighest stage of savikalpa-samadhi,\none is able to attain the realization o=\r\nf one&#39;s own primal substratum,\nwhich is composed of saccidananda (sat, cit =\r\nand ananda), or\nunadulterated consciousness qualified by the attributive qu=\r\nalities of\nnever-ending being, cognizance and bliss. In the second stage of=\r\n\nsamadhi, known as nirvikalpa-samadhi, the yogi achieves complete\nidentific=\r\nation with her true self, atman, and has direct praesentia\ndei perception o=\r\nf Parabrahman, the Supreme Absolute. This is an\nexperience that is describe=\r\nd as being situated beyond the delimiting\nmodes of time and space, thus utt=\r\nerly transcendental in content. In\nthe immediate aftermath of this radical =\r\nontological shift in the\nyogi&#39;s subjective locus, a complete transformation=\r\n of her\nconsciousness subsequently ensues. The externally observable\nramifi=\r\ncations of the samadhi phenomenon on the subject (the yogi\n/rishi) are two-=\r\nfold. One is psychological in nature, the other\nepistemological.\n\nThe psych=\r\nological and cognitive impact of the samadhi phenomenon is\nradically transf=\r\normative in nature. This transformation that occurs\nwithin the yogi (soon t=\r\no be rishi) affects her on a variety of levels,\nincluding intellectual, men=\r\ntal, emotional, nervous, and ethical. For\nthe sake of remaining firmly situ=\r\nated within the epistemic bounds of\nthe present work, however, we will focu=\r\ns primarily on the cognitive\nmodification that takes place in the psyche of=\r\n the rishi (seer).\nBecause the rishi has conquered the demands of the ego, =\r\nshe is no\nlonger subject to the four imperfections of bhrama (the tendency\n=\r\ntoward illusion), pramada (inattentiveness), vipralasa (the desire to\ncheat=\r\n) and karanapatava (insufficiency of the senses) put forth by\nHindu philoso=\r\nphers in their critique of pratyaksha and anumana. The\nBhagavad-gita explai=\r\nns this state in the following manner.\n\n\n&quot;He whose mind is not affected in =\r\nsorrow\nand is free from desire in pleasure\nand who is without attachment, f=\r\near, or anger -\nhe is called a sage of steady insight (sthita-dhi).&quot;\n\n\nSinc=\r\ne her knowledge of the truth is derived via direct, non-mediated\ntransmissi=\r\non - from Brahman (God) to atman (soul) - completely\nbypassing the customar=\r\ny intermediary routes of the senses, mind,\nintellect and ego, karanapatava =\r\n(insufficiency of the senses) is\naverted. Empirical and rational instrument=\r\ns simply are no longer\nemployed in this instance. Therefore, their perfecti=\r\non, or lack\nthereof, is rendered a thorough non-issue. Additionally, becaus=\r\ne she\nis no longer under the illusion that her self-interest is of any\nsupe=\r\nrior value to the ultimate spiritual interest of all other beings,\nthe defe=\r\nct of vipralasa (the desire to cheat), also, no longer\napplies. The ultimat=\r\ne interest of all other living beings is now her\nsupreme interest. Thus the=\r\n apta (reliable person) is a perfectly\nmoral being, acting from and in good=\r\nness, not due to a mere sense of\nnecessitating duty, but out of her own int=\r\nrinsic atmic (spiritual)\nnature. Having attained a state of dharana, or per=\r\nfect concentration,\nshe is not subject to pramada (inattentiveness). Being =\r\nthoroughly\nabsorbed in the loving contemplation (upasana) of Brahman, her\na=\r\nttention is perfectly and effortlessly alert, never diverted and\never-focus=\r\ned. Finally, having transcended the firm grip of maya\n(illusion) altogether=\r\n, the tendency of bhrama (the tendency toward\nillusion) is nothing more tha=\r\nn a faint memory for the rishi.\n\nHaving thus risen above all the defective =\r\ntendencies of the mundane\ncognitive processes, the rishi is seen, by the va=\r\nst majority of\nphilosophers within the Sad-darshana (seven schools of Sanat=\r\nana Dharma\nphilosophy) tradition, as the most indisputable source of knowle=\r\ndge.\nThe rishi is not merely an intellectual who attempts to grasp the\ntrut=\r\nh, captures it, and then mechanically teaches it to others.\nRather, she is =\r\na transparent via medium through which transcendent\ntruth is seen and direc=\r\ntly experienced first-hand. She is a breathing\nexample of truth in living, =\r\ncaring motion. In a poem created by Ren=E9\nDumal, we find a beautiful descr=\r\niption of the profound experience that\nthe rishi has:\n\n\n&quot;You cannot stay on=\r\n the summit forever;\nYou have to come down again.\nSo why bother in the firs=\r\nt place? Just this:\nWhat is above knows what is below,\nBut what is below do=\r\nes not know what is above.\nOne climbs, one sees.\nOne descends, one sees no =\r\nlonger, but one has seen.\nThere is an art of conducting oneself in the lowe=\r\nr regions.\nWhen one can no longer see, one can at least still know.&quot;\n\n\nFor =\r\nSanatana Dharma, the rishi is no less than a living testament to\nthe existe=\r\nnce, nature, and power of God. It is for this reason that\nthe rishis are te=\r\nrmed aptah, or &quot;perfectly reliable authorities.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n______________________=\r\n______________________________________\n\n\n\n&quot;Dr. Frank Morales represents the=\r\n Sankalpa [the will] of the Hindu\npeople and the cause of Sanatana Dharma. =\r\nI urge all Hindus\neverywhere to give him your full support, assistance, and=\r\n\nencouragement in his crucial work.
