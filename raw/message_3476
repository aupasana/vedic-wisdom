I was writing in a flow and never checked what I wrote. K=\r\nindly pardon such errors and read through them. As they say, &quot;Bhavnayoko sa=\r\nmjho!&quot;.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; During the day time, we roamed around =\r\nshooting at different places. In this 3 days we never visited any of the te=\r\nmples in Kasi. I asked him, &quot;What about the temples? Won&#39;t we visit them?&quot;.=\r\n Manish retorted immediately, &quot;=C2=A0Aren&#39;t we=C2=A0going to the most power=\r\nful temple in Kasi every night?&quot;! I silently agreed. This is something abou=\r\nt Manish I have observed. He rarely enters temples or standard places of wo=\r\nrship, but suddenly he might see a small roadside temple and stand and star=\r\ne for sometimes, even do a pranam and then remark, &quot;There is something here=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; During evening we went to visit the Kinnaram Ashram. Kinnaram=\r\n Baba was a Aghori who lived in Kasi=C2=A0during the 16th century. The plac=\r\ne is called Aghor-sthal. Before entering Manish bought some bel leaves. As =\r\nwe walked inside the Ashram, Manish became silent, then said there are stro=\r\nng energies in here. Inside we meditated for sometime, Manish did=C2=A0 pra=\r\nnam=C2=A0at the samadhi of Baba Bhagwan Ram who was the 11th head of the As=\r\nhram. Baba Bhagwan Ram had entered Nirvikalpa Samadhi while meditating for =\r\n3 continuous days at the Manikarnika Samshan.=C2=A0 Manish, on being=C2=A0q=\r\nuestioned, said that many sadhanas have been done here in this place for lo=\r\nng by people with no mundane desires. Therefore, the energies are strong he=\r\nre. While looking around the Ashram we found some quotations which were wri=\r\ntten in small wooden boards. Manish called Arunisha and me and pointed to o=\r\nne quotation. Translated to English, it read, &quot;If you have to give your hea=\r\nd off to get a sadguru, you\n&gt;  have=C2=A0got it cheap&quot;.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; By 8 PM =\r\nwe sat for dinner. We used to have early dinners, so that we had sufficient=\r\n time before going to the samshan. Ideally you should have an empty stomach=\r\n while performing any sadhana to get the best effects. The amount of fire i=\r\nn the body is fixed. There is one that digests food - Jathara Agni. One tha=\r\nt digests ideas/concepts/experiences - Bhuta Agni (existential fire) which =\r\nexists in the subtle body. It is the second which must increase in order fo=\r\nr one to &quot;digest&quot; various experiences/ideas/etc. It can only increase when =\r\nthe Jathara Agni is less, i.e. you do not have a full stomach. When we are =\r\nextremely focused on something and working intently on the same, we forget =\r\nfood, we do not feel hungry. This is due to the increase in Bhuta Agni and =\r\ndecrease in Jathara Agni.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; As we sat eating our food and talking =\r\non different topics, we discussed history.The conversation mentioned here i=\r\ns a thread picked up from an earlier conversation that we (Manish, Arunisha=\r\n and=C2=A0me) had before coming to Kasi. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Manish said, &quot;It is th=\r\ne same set of=C2=A0souls who come back=C2=A0again and again in different bo=\r\ndies and personalities at different times, who=C2=A0are responsible for thi=\r\ns land. There was Chadragupta and Chanakya, there was Prithviraj, there was=\r\n Akbar, Shankaracharya, Ramakrishna etc.&quot; He continued, &quot;They can come as k=\r\nings, yogis, or any other form which is necessary for them to accomplish th=\r\neir dharma. And their dharma is connected to this land=C2=A0which we call I=\r\nndia=C2=A0today.This land is connected to the Rishis. This is Rishi bhoomi.=\r\n And Rishis sent people when needed.=C2=A0Prithviraj made one mistake, of p=\r\nardoning Ghori. Imagine what happened to that woman who made Prithiviraj di=\r\nsobey his Guru?&quot;.I silently contemplated her fate.=C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &quot;One ve=\r\nry senior Rishi has decided to=C2=A0change this land back to a Rishi bhoomi=\r\n. And so shall it happen.=C2=A0Ved=C2=A0Dharma will be re established here =\r\nalong the length and breadth. Nothing, however powerful or mightly, be it a=\r\nn individual or=C2=A0group,=C2=A0can stand against the will of a Rishi.&quot;=C2=\r\n=A0 Arunisha asked a pertinent question here. &quot;What were the Rishis doing f=\r\nor=C2=A0one thousand years?&quot;. Manish laughed and said, &quot; A Rishi can very w=\r\nell spend a thousand years simply in samadhi, meditating. Then suddenly=C2=\r\n=A0one day=C2=A0wake up from meditation=C2=A0and see that Rishi bhoomi is g=\r\none=C2=A0and all sorts of non-spiritual things going on here. So He decides=\r\n, it is time to get back and re create the Rishi bhoomi. You guys have no c=\r\nlue about=C2=A0what a Rishi can do. One Rishi is enough to change a univers=\r\ne, changing a country is child&#39;s play for Him.&quot; Wow. I let all these sink i=\r\nnside me slowly. Therefore it is so important to keep doing sadhana, in som=\r\ne manner or the other.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; As night approached midnight, Manish and =\r\nI left for the Manikarnika again. This was going be our last night of Chand=\r\ni homa at Manikarnika, for now. We walked long the=C2=A0deserted ghats, sli=\r\nently. I asked him if it is ok doing a=C2=A0homa of Shiva/Bhairava on a pyr=\r\ne. He said=C2=A0yes why not, but without Shakti, there will be no Shiva. Wo=\r\nrshipping the divine feminie is the most practical strategy of sadhana. Shi=\r\nva is the state of highest consciousness, and to reach that stage one must =\r\ndevelop his body and mind such that it can hold shakti=C2=A0for which=C2=A0=\r\nworshipping the divine Mother is the best way.=C2=A0That is why Vimalananda=\r\n says, &quot;Let the Mother show you the face of the Father&quot;. The topic drifted =\r\nto Vimalananda. Manish said, &quot;Kala Bhairava is very strong in Manikarnika, =\r\nwhere as Mahakala exists powerfully in the cremation grouds at Ujjain. But =\r\nVimalananda did Mahakala sadhana here in Manikarnika.&quot; Then staring at the =\r\npitch black ganges, Manish chuckled lightly and\n&gt;  added, &quot;That man was som=\r\nething.&quot; This was again an old conversation we had started=C2=A0before whic=\r\nh Mainsh continued, &quot;All these babas of today would wet their pants if Vima=\r\nlananda were to stand infornt of them. Those three books have the power of =\r\na deity flowing through them. Without being physically present, Vimalananda=\r\n has created a army of sadhakas!&quot;. I interjected, &quot;The books=C2=A0are like =\r\na Bible=C2=A0for sadhakas,=C2=A0arn&#39;t they?&quot;. &quot;Yes&quot; said Manish. Later on I=\r\n asked him if it was possible for someone to meet Vimalanada, to which Mani=\r\nsh replied that yes it was, if one does serious sadhana. However, the impor=\r\ntant question is whether one will be able to recognize him. I fell silent h=\r\nearing this. Interestingly, in the 2nd book of the Aghora series, Vimalanda=\r\n does mention that a time will come when his &quot;children&quot; would spread homas.=\r\n Strange, or maybe not so. Who knows how deep things run. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; We re=\r\nached the samshan by half past twelve. This time we sat at the same place w=\r\nhere we had sat on the first day of homa. The fire was low. Most of the bod=\r\ny had been burnt already. Manish started the homa. As usual, all the dogs c=\r\name and sat peacefully around the fire. Now this did not surprise me any mo=\r\nre. In the middle of the homa Manish would slowly lift his=C2=A0palm upward=\r\ns=C2=A0and with the next ahuti=C2=A0immediately the fire would leap higher.=\r\n He did this quite a few times, when=C2=A0the flames were getting weaker. I=\r\n countinued with the Chandi path and passing on the samagri to him as and w=\r\nhen he required anything. One dom who was working on a pyre nearby, came to=\r\nwards us and exclaimed,&quot;Jai Mahadev&quot;. Manish too responded back, &quot;Jai Mahad=\r\nev&quot;. This homa was faster. He did not use any &quot;samputs&quot;, but a direct, stra=\r\night Chandi homa. Again in the middle I got up and stroked the pyre a bit, =\r\npushing around some of the coconut pieces to make them burn properly. I was=\r\n\n&gt;  enjoying it. A few people came and sat near us, listening to the path. =\r\nIn Kasi there is a rule that whatever comes in the Samshan is the property =\r\nof the Dom Raja (the head of doms). No one has any further claim on it. In =\r\nold times, one Dom Raja was called Kallu Dom. He was an Aghori and a contem=\r\nporary of Kinnaram Baba. It is said he could raise the dead back to life. M=\r\naybe it is because of this tradition that Manikarnika is such an apt place =\r\nfor these sadhanas. I was at one point mentally wondering why are there so =\r\nmany people in the samshan. The Manish said, if a Nath came here in his gar=\r\nb, everyone will run away from the samshan scared. But there is a reason wh=\r\ny there are people here even so late in the night.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Once the fina=\r\nl purnahuti was given, we sat for meditation. Though this homa got over fas=\r\nter than previous days, the meditation that happened, for me, was superb. A=\r\nt one point I felt as if my mind would just burst forth and expand across t=\r\nhe length and breadth of the Ganges. My focus was good, but I had to open m=\r\ny eyes after every 20 minutes or so. Manish continued meditating for nearly=\r\n an hour. Not the slightest movement from him. Nothing. Still like a stone.=\r\n Then a cow came and slightly nudged Manish on his feet. That made him open=\r\n his eyes. Manish remarked, &quot; I could have just left my body and gone off. =\r\nIt did not matter that I had a flight to catch the next day, or anything el=\r\nse. I was on the verge of death. Just at that moment the cow and brought me=\r\n back.&quot; Smiling he added, &quot;What a sight it would have been for the people t=\r\no see, how the body can be left at will&quot;.=C2=A0 I did not know what to say.=\r\n \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; We stood there watching another pyre in front. The body was ha=\r\nlf burnt. The torso had become black with deep=C2=A0red patches all over. T=\r\nhe dom came forward, and with the bamboo stick inserted it (the bamboo stic=\r\nk)=C2=A0from the side of the corpse, lifting up the burning torso into the =\r\nair and placing it again, strategically, in the middle of the pyre. The smo=\r\noth=C2=A0motion of lifting up the half burnt torso, sticking out from one e=\r\nnd of the bamboo stick,=C2=A0into the thin, dark, night-air reminded me of =\r\nhow we use a fork to lift pieces of food - meat=C2=A0or vegetables, both de=\r\nad -=C2=A0from our plates to our mouths. Manish asked me smiling, &quot;Maza aya=\r\n?&quot;. I smiled back in acknowledgement. Then he commented=C2=A0that I should =\r\nwrite about this experience in the coming days. Let people know.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n By this time I remembered that when I was sitting and doing the Chandi pat=\r\nh, one dog=C2=A0had run off with one of my chappals. I informed Manish. He =\r\nexclaimed, &quot; Kya baat hai! Leave the other chappal here as well.&quot; Manish sa=\r\nid we had a rna with this samshan. We had been here before, in some life.\n&gt;=\r\n =C2=A0\n&gt; As we were returning, Manish said one of the point (the three pea=\r\nks)=C2=A0of Shiva&#39;s trishul passes through the Manikarkina. Therefore, it i=\r\ns a &quot;safe&quot; samshan. Anyone who tries anything negative here will face troub=\r\nles. The trishul of Shiva guards this place. No spirit will cause any unnec=\r\nessary disturbance inside the samshan. That is also why there are people he=\r\nre even at 2 am in the morning. There is safety in numbers. As long as ones=\r\n intentions are genuine and good, Manikarnika is a wonderful place to do sa=\r\ndhana.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; While walking along the ghats=C2=A0which were=C2=A0totall=\r\ny deserted, Manish instructed me not to stop. The knot in my red lungi was =\r\nbecoming loose, I caught hold of it=C2=A0with one=C2=A0hand and kept moving=\r\n fast, trying to keep pace with Manish. Later Manish asked me if I had got =\r\nsome smell. I thought and recollected that yes, I did get a faint smell of =\r\nheena. Twice. Manish told me it was a &quot;Mokul&quot;. A muslim spirit of similar l=\r\nevel as a Yaksha or a Yakshini. Once the ritual is over, and you are out of=\r\n the samshan, do not wait along the banks, he instructed. Do not move too c=\r\nlose to the water=C2=A0late in the nightt. There are things in the water. G=\r\nenerally they may not do anything, but why take a chance. The protection of=\r\n Shiva is only inside the Manikarnika Ghat. Then he added, Deoriya Baba (I =\r\nmay have mis-spelt the name) used to live in the middle of this Ganges 24/7=\r\n. This is a city of saints. Here God-intoxicated Paramhamsas would roam aro=\r\nund naked. It is their city.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Next morning, as we sat recollectin=\r\ng the previous night&#39;s homa, Manish talked about Vedas.=C2=A0Few sadhaks, i=\r\nf ever, are equally comfortable with both paths of=C2=A0Aghora and Vedas. F=\r\nor a Veda mantra to show its effects, one must get the intonation perfect. =\r\nThis age most people cannot do that. I=C2=A0enquired that I had heard from =\r\nsomeone that a certain procedure needs to be done before one starts any sad=\r\nhana in the samshan. Manish=C2=A0laughed and replied,=C2=A0&quot;Karna to sab ku=\r\nch chahiye, par mujhe to kuch nehi aata!&quot;.=C2=A0I was dumbstruck.=C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; While talking about Ramayana with Arunisha, his eyes suddenly beco=\r\nme half closed. He voice became slow and heavy,=C2=A0&quot;The color of Rama&#39;s b=\r\nody is deep blue with a golden tinge all=C2=A0around him. Like a sun blazin=\r\ng. That=C2=A0was the kavacha given to Rama by Vishwamitra, the real Gayatri=\r\n with two special samputs. It was impenetrable. And when he shot his arrows=\r\n, the motion of his hands=C2=A0is so fast that a normal human eye will not =\r\nable to observe. In 12 hours he had destroyed a forest of Ashuras.=C2=A0Rav=\r\nana had a Chandrahaas khadga. It was a=C2=A0mantra shakti he had acquired t=\r\nhrough sadhana. The Khadga had become part of his right hand, which would f=\r\nly off to kill mercilessly at the slightest=C2=A0command from his mind. Suc=\r\nh was the calibre of the enemy. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; And Rama removed even=C2=A0his =\r\nGayatri Kavacha, and fought like a normal human being when he defeated Rava=\r\nna which=C2=A0means; he even removed the last vestige of his ego of being a=\r\n God, and fought like a human. Is it any wonder then, that the whole of nor=\r\nth India goes crazy at the mere mention of the name of Sri Rama?&quot;. \n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; He spoke with such an energy which cannot be defined, as if he was th=\r\nere and seen it all. Rama Naam Satya Hai.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Thus ends my recountin=\r\ng of our fascinating trip to Kasi.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Rama Naama Satya Hai..\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sat, 16/1/10, rajarshi nandy &lt;ra=\r\njarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\n&gt; Subjec=\r\nt: [vedic-wisdom] Rama Naam Satya Hai - 2\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@...=\r\nm\n&gt; Date: Saturday, 16 January, 2010, 11:25 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Narasimha\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; It may sound weird, but this is wha=\r\nt happens in real life all the time. You, I, all these people are pieces in=\r\n another kind of chess game. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Great analogy. Manish had given th=\r\nis analogy to us after he=C2=A0completed a beautiful=C2=A0Ganapati homa las=\r\nt August. There is=C2=A0one divine chess player, and it is totally His game=\r\n. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Before I continue with the narration, I would like to mention=\r\n a few points which I found I had not clearly mentioned in my last mail:\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; At the end of the third day of Chandi homa at Manikarnika samsh=\r\nan, we were standing and watching the pyres burn, when Manish suddenly said=\r\n, in the coming days you will write about this experience in a public forum=\r\n. Therefore my mails.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; Caveat: A homa on a funeral pyre is an =\r\nextreme Aghor=C2=A0sadhana, and it is not entirely risk free. Infact, in ma=\r\nny paramparas it is said=C2=A0only someone who has a direct agya from Samsh=\r\nan Kali or Mahakala can try this procedure, or someone who has agya from a =\r\npowerful Guru. It was Manish who was doing the homa, (giving ahutis)=C2=A0I=\r\n was only doing the Chandi Path. Therefore, by reading this accounts one sh=\r\nould not, on his own, try out this sadhana. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; Many people have=\r\n a negative=C2=A0bias towards Aghor sadhanas and Aghoris. This is party due=\r\n to lack of knowledge or understanding of the philosophy and efficacy of th=\r\nese sadhanas. Moreover, in recent time some TV channels too have made films=\r\n etc of Aghoris, potraying them as perverted individuals. This is grossly i=\r\nncorrect. They have no clue what they are talking about, and their accounts=\r\n start with many preconcieved biases. Aghora is one of the many path to the=\r\n reach the same goals - Self-realization. It is neither bad nor good. It is=\r\n a path. Some like it, some don&#39;t. Which is ok. We must follow our chosen p=\r\nath but at the same time have a healthy respect for other paths too. Many g=\r\nreat saints and spiritual giants have taken this path. Guru Dattatreya is c=\r\nonsidered the first Aghori. The 9 great Naths were all Aghoris. Sri Trilang=\r\na Swami was an Aghori too. Vimalanada was a master Aghori. My mails are int=\r\nended to give a first hand objective=C2=A0account of how a\n&gt;  powerful sadh=\r\nana in the samshan is performed. Nothing more. I am just the cronicler.\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; There are many people in this age who have a desire for these s=\r\nadhanas, who feel an attraction for this kind of a path, but have no clue h=\r\now to go about it. These accounts are ment to tell such=C2=A0people that th=\r\nese sadhanas can and do happen even today, it is not a figment of imaginati=\r\non. The Manikarnika is still as powerful as it was thousands of years ago. =\r\nBut to go about it and=C2=A0actually be able to do this sadhana, just like =\r\neverything else in life, there is no fixed procedures or rules. Keep doing =\r\nsadhana in whatever condition you are in right now=C2=A0and let Nature deci=\r\nde. Like Sai Baba says, Shradha and Saburi. Respect and patience. If the de=\r\nsire is genuine and deep, and one is ready to wait, Nature will one day mak=\r\ne arrangements. This is the eternal promise to every individual=C2=A0becaus=\r\ne for Her, NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE. And She is so=C2=A0kind.=C2=A0 In the int=\r\nruduction to &quot;Aghora - At the left hand of God&quot;, Vimalanada says :\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&quot;Publish this book after I am gone. Let people know the truth. Let them kno=\r\nw what is what. Out of the thousands who may read it at least a few will be=\r\n sincere. They will try to learn more, and then Nature Herself will make ar=\r\nrangements for them to learn just as She did for me, and they will be taugh=\r\nt according to their capabilities. The progression will go on; there is not=\r\nhing to fear&quot;.\n&gt; Therefore have faith, do sadhana.=C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Bac=\r\nk to the narration. The second day was Astami Tithi of Krishna Paksha. Mani=\r\nsh said it is a powerful night for chita homa. Various shaktis are availabl=\r\ne on this night which can destroy Ashuras.=C2=A0Past midnight we were walki=\r\nng towards Manikarnika along the ghats. Not a single person was to be seen =\r\nanywhere on any of the multitude of ghats which we crossed. Suddenly we fou=\r\nnd a pack of dogs, fighting among each other, blocking our path. We stopped=\r\n, wondering if there was any alternate route to the samshan. I started ment=\r\nally chanting a mantra I knew and praying to the deity to make our journey =\r\nsmooth. Coincidentally, just at that moment we saw a man coming from the ot=\r\nher side who chased the dogs away.=C2=A0Without looking at me=C2=A0Manish s=\r\naid, &quot;Sometimes a simple prayer can work wonders but never become to big fo=\r\nr your breeches&quot;.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; As we passed the Lalita Ghat Manish said this =\r\nis a wonderful place.=C2=A0I did not think too much about it then since my =\r\nmind was already pre occupied with the thoughts of what is to come. The nex=\r\nt day morning when we again came to the Lalita Ghat for some shooting, I su=\r\nddenly felt a pressure on my head, and then everything became calm. Manish =\r\nsmiled at me and said this is where Trilanga Swami did his tapashya and the=\r\n energies are still here. I was little skeptical mentally, since I knew tha=\r\nt the samadhi of Trilanga Swami was at a different ghat, however I did not =\r\nsay anything.=C2=A0Later on returning to Mumbai I spoke to someone who was =\r\nfrom Beneras and that person confirmed that indeed Trilanga Swami used to s=\r\ntay at the Lalita Ghat and do his sadhana. Conclusion, I am a confirmed idi=\r\not.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Back to midnight. We reached Manikarnika and again it was fi=\r\nlled with people. But this time we did not wait. We went right inside, and =\r\nManish kept looking for a suitable chita. As we came in, again people start=\r\ned staring at us, but they respectfully made way for us to pass through to =\r\nthe middle of the samshan. We stood exactly at the middle, with Manish obse=\r\nrving the different chitas. There were about 8/10 of them burning. It is sa=\r\nid in thousands of years there has not been a single minute when there has =\r\nnot been a body burning in here. Therefore it is one of the Mahasamshans in=\r\n India. There was one chita to my right which Manish was observing, when su=\r\nddenly I found a mega size bull come and stand right next to the fire. I di=\r\nd not want to sit there, the bull looked dangerous. Before I could voice my=\r\n concern, Manish said let us go to the other side of the samshan. It not on=\r\nly the bull,=C2=A0 but there is something else as well. I did not ask him w=\r\nhat. So we\n&gt;  went to another side. The dom there came forward and said to =\r\nManish, &quot;Baba,aap log=C2=A0kaun se chita me baithna chahate ho?&quot;. Manish in=\r\ndicated one at the end, the dome then went ahead and asked the people stand=\r\ning around the chita to make space for us to sit. He said the heat from the=\r\n fire is too stong, but Manish said it&#39;s ok, we&#39;ll sit here itself. There w=\r\nere many curious onlookers, but all made space for us to sit comfortably. I=\r\n could hear the dom instructing others not to disturb the pyre we were sitt=\r\ning at. This is something very unique about Manikarnika. IN any other city,=\r\n people would have objected, but not here. Manish later said, it is a tradi=\r\ntion of this place, Aghor sadhanas have been done in here for countless cen=\r\nturies. Therefore the domes have either themsleves seen these things or hea=\r\nrd from their families and thus they do not disturb. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; The homa, =\r\nas usual was awesome. The pyre was larger than the one previous night. The =\r\nheat was very strong. My focus was stronger. My mind was much calmer than t=\r\nhe previous night. Within ten minutes again a pack of dogs came and sat aro=\r\nund this pyre. This was strange because=C2=A0there were at least ten pyres =\r\nburning, and all of them chose this specific pyre for some inexplicable rea=\r\nson. Dogs have a far subtler sense perception than average humans like me. =\r\nThis homa was extended longer. Every now and then Manish would suddenly loo=\r\nk at a certain direction intently for a few second. I too would turn and lo=\r\nok that way but saw nothing. But, everytime Manish looked at a specific dir=\r\nection or made some gestures, the dogs too would start barking at that dire=\r\nction. At one point I almost felt a bit jealous of the dogs, they could see=\r\n/sense things which I=C2=A0 - being such an=C2=A0ordinary person -=C2=A0obv=\r\niously had no clue about. In the middle of the Chandi path=C2=A0I could hea=\r\nr\n&gt;  chants of &quot;Ram Nam Satya Hai&quot; and relatives wailing as new bodies were=\r\n being brought in. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Suddenly to my right there was a sound and q=\r\nuite abit of smoke, I saw a transformer bursting. The dogs immediately star=\r\nted barking at that. Later Manish said the Goddess was moving around, enter=\r\ning the fire and leaving the fire. The bursting of the transformer had a li=\r\nnk to this. As the Path was going on - the Chandi was in my right hand - I =\r\nsaw a human shadow pass over=C2=A0the pages of the=C2=A0book. I thought it =\r\nwas some relative who was standing behind me.=C2=A0I looked back and was a =\r\nshocked to find there was no one behind me. And the shadow passed over my b=\r\nook once again. This time I did not look back. Just kept chanting with more=\r\n vigor and saying to myself &quot;all iz well&quot;-:).=C2=A0 Manish later said, as o=\r\nne does sadhana the deity often comes to observe and make his/her presence =\r\nfelt, even if slightly.=C2=A0It is not an imagination but reality and this =\r\ncan=C2=A0happen not just in a samshan but in any sadhana anywhere. The idea=\r\n is to keep doing sadhana.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; While offering coconuts into the fire=\r\n, one coconut rolled off from the pyre. So I took a long bamboo stick which=\r\n the domes use to stroke the fire and pushed the coconut piece inside.I won=\r\ndered if I=C2=A0had been a dom in any of my past lives, because I strangely=\r\n felt natural stroking the pyre=C2=A0the way the domes do. I even wondered =\r\nif=C2=A0there was any company which would may me for this kind of a job, I =\r\nwould happily take it. What better way to do sadhana than become a dom at M=\r\nanikarkina!=C2=A0Interestingly, I then remembered that Manish had bought on=\r\ne extra coconut while buying the samagri to tonight&#39;s homas. Now I understo=\r\nod why.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; In the middle of the homa, suddenly Manish called one of=\r\n the relatives who was standing nearby and told him=C2=A0that the person wh=\r\nos body was in the pyre has just left and that=C2=A0they (relatives) do not=\r\n have to wait any more. It was already late in the night. The person did no=\r\nt know what to say. Suddenly Manish explained to him, do not worry, there i=\r\ns nothing evil or bad being done here. We are only praying to Ma Durga. I g=\r\nuess the person was mentally wondering about what is going on. Then another=\r\n of the relatives came forward and said, &quot;Baba, hum log ahsirwad leke hi ja=\r\nyenge&quot;. So Manish said ok and asked them to sit down and continued with the=\r\n homa. In the middle of the homa suddenly Manish asked me to observe the sk=\r\nin on the corpse=C2=A0 I saw the skin on the face had caught fire and was b=\r\nurning. It was a sight to see!\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; There is a tradition of pouring G=\r\nanges water=C2=A0at the end to finsh the fire. But I could hear the domes t=\r\nelling the relatives not to pour water on the pyre or do anything there wit=\r\nhout permissin from Manish. Finally at the end they came to Manish and=C2=\r\n=A0asked if they could pour some Ganges water. Manish said ok, but in a low=\r\n voice told me nothing will happen to the fire, it won&#39;t die. They poured a=\r\n large mud kalash full of water but nothing happened to the fire. It kept b=\r\nurning. After some times, after some more ahutis, Manish called the people =\r\nand said, &quot; Devi=C2=A0samne khadi hai. App log pranam kijiye&quot;. At least 10/=\r\n15 people came forward and reventially bowed to the fire. Then they wanted =\r\nto touch=C2=A0Manish&#39;s feet, but Manish would not let them do so. They aske=\r\nd for his blessings. He distributed some flower petals we had and told them=\r\n to go home, since it was very late in the night. Suddenly the man, who had=\r\n some doubts (whom Manish had addressed earlier) came\n&gt;  running with tears=\r\n in his eyes asking for forgiveness for having doubted. Manish consoled him=\r\n, told him nothing to worry, he has done no wrong, everything is all right.=\r\n=C2=A0 Later Manish said, if it was some other time of the day he would hav=\r\ne brought the man along for a cup of tea. Another person suddenly came to M=\r\nanish and asked him if he was a certain saint (a famous saint)=C2=A0who use=\r\nd to live in Kasi. Manish without responding to his query asked him where w=\r\nas he from, the person replied interior=C2=A0Bihar. Manish advised him to g=\r\no back home as it was late in the night. The faith of the ordinary people o=\r\nf this land is what makes India so unique, that is why our land and culture=\r\n is still so alive. We city bred &#39;educated&#39;=C2=A0people are too rational to=\r\n understand these things. God loves the simple and uncalculating. By this t=\r\nime I too stood up to do pranam to the fire. Immediately I felt as if my bo=\r\ndy existed only from my head to my heart, there was nothing\n&gt;  below, no le=\r\ngs, no stomach ,=C2=A0as if=C2=A0I was simply floating on thin=C2=A0air! I =\r\ntold Manish what happened, he just gave a=C2=A0curt one word reply, &quot;Good&quot;.=\r\n\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; As we were walking back from Manikarnika Mani=\r\nsh suddenly said, &quot;There is a foreigner lady who lives close to Manikarnika=\r\n, who has a lot of desire to perform sadhanas in the samshan but does not k=\r\nnow how to go about it. I saw her while meditating.&quot; For a woman to come an=\r\nd perform these sadhanas is practically difficult or impossible, unless she=\r\n is a Yogini or a sadhaka of great calibre. Ordinary people would not be ab=\r\nle to meet the gaze of a Yogini, said Manish. The next morning, when we cam=\r\ne to the Lalita Ghat (as I mentioned above), I saw a thin, frail, looking f=\r\noreigner lady sitting on the banks. Manish quitely indicated to me that, th=\r\nat is the lady whom he had seen last night in his meditation at the samshan=\r\n. &quot;She has desire, but directionless. &quot; At that time there was nothing more=\r\n we could do. I guess that is why it is so important to keep doing some sad=\r\nhana on your own, instead of merely contemplating which is of no good,=C2=\r\n=A0so that you are ready when\n&gt;  Nature decides to give you a push. \n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; After passing the Lalita Ghat, next afternoon,=C2=A0we stood and obse=\r\nrved Manikarnika from a distance. We were dressed like any other tourist, s=\r\npecially with Manish&#39;s camera hanging from his neck=C2=A0and the=C2=A0tripo=\r\nd. Manish smiled and said let us not go too close to Manikarnika, what if t=\r\nhe doms recognize us! They would be shell shocked seeing us dressed as tour=\r\nists, wondering what is going on.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Thus ended my second day of ob=\r\nserving a Chandi homa on a funeral pyre at the famed Manikarnika Ghats of K=\r\nashi.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Rama Naam Satya Hai\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The INTERNET now has a personality.
