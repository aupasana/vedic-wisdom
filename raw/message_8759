There will be some works that do not represent the=\r\nir final/full understanding.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; (3) The Truth is sufficiently captured=\r\n by Veda and Upanishad. That way, there is no need for any additional works=\r\n. Though people cannot comprehend them and need someone to comment on them,=\r\n nobody can capture the Truth more perfectly than Veda and Upanishad. So, w=\r\nhat ends up happening is that one focuses on a small part of the Truth capt=\r\nured by them and explains it in the desa-kala-patra of one&#39;s times.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt;=\r\n Shankaraka wrote commentaries on the ageless Truths of Upanishad, as per h=\r\nis desa-kala-patra. Now, people can&#39;t understand even his commentary as it =\r\nwas meant. So there are further commentaries on his commentaries, based on =\r\nOUR desa-kala-patra!\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; (4) The goal of a master is often not to write=\r\n something perfect (if so, Veda and Upanishad are already there), but to wr=\r\nite something more direct and useful to one&#39;s audience. Every master may co=\r\nme with a mission and focus on that mission. Adi Shankara&#39;s primary mission=\r\n was to stop the advance of Buddhism and show how tenets of Buddhism are co=\r\nntained in Vedanta.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; (5) If one thinks (like a learned friend of min=\r\ne does) that every word of Adi Shankara is gospel and perfect truth, I invi=\r\nte them to read his commentary on &quot;Ishavasyopanishad&quot; (aka &quot;Ishopanishad&quot;).=\r\n One can certainly view it as the great Shankara tying himself in knots! TH=\r\nAT upanishad really challenges the simplified main message Shankara chose t=\r\no drive home in THAT incarnation!\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Contrast it with how Sri Aurobind=\r\no does justice to that key Upanishad!\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -=\r\n-------\n&gt; Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.or=\r\ng \n&gt; --------\n&gt; =A0=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, Oct 11, 2012 at 5:26 PM, rajar=\r\nshi nandy wrote:\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Dear Utpal, \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; &lt;&lt; \n&gt; It may require a LOT to=\r\n reject philosophy of giant such as adi Shankara and yet some one may not b=\r\ne able to reject afterall. &gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Philosophy is pure rational thought. Sp=\r\nirituality on the other hand is experiential. One can sit in an armchair an=\r\nd contemplate on philosophy, but the same is not possible in case of spirit=\r\nuality. These two are different. Philosophy gives a logical framework of un=\r\nderstanding something. There could be philosophy of science, a philosophy o=\r\nf ethics, a philosophy of spirituality, a philosophy of epistemology (the i=\r\nnvestigations into the process of acquiring knowledge) etc. \n&gt; \n&gt; That Sri =\r\nAdi Shankara was a fantastic spiritual giant, I have no doubt (which I have=\r\n already stated in my previous email. Vibhuti of God). I am also sure that =\r\nthe very presence of such a man of such spiritual stature would have natura=\r\nlly drawn masses towards him.=A0 It happens with all great personalities. T=\r\nhey have a magnetism which extends=A0 way beyond after their death. \n&gt; \n&gt; H=\r\nowever, to understand, appreciate, criticize, debate, analyses, comparative=\r\nly-evaluate any philosophy of any individual is not that difficult and is a=\r\n valid rational process. \n&gt; \n&gt; While future is always uncertain, but chance=\r\ns look remote for me that I would find Mayavada more attractive. It was Sri=\r\n Adi Shankara&#39;s Mayavada - as is understood and propagated by his followers=\r\n - which I had studied when I was first trying to get a grasp of Hindu phil=\r\nosophy. It a nice, compact and easily understandable philosophy. Possibly o=\r\nne the chief reasons why most=A0 intellectuals like his Adwaitha apart from=\r\n being attracted by his personality. It is easier to debate from Sri Shanka=\r\nra&#39;s stand-point. At that time I liked it. Later as I got acquainted myself=\r\n with more varieties of Hindu philosophy, I found others more comprehensive=\r\n and covering more essential points and using a very, if I may use this phr=\r\nase, a bottom-up=A0 approach to understanding reality, while Sri Shankara&#39;s=\r\n philosophy is a very top-down approach, with a greater thrust on the top a=\r\nnd an indeterminate leftover in the bottom. Shankara&#39;s Adwaitha, Ramanujach=\r\narya&#39;s Visistha-adwaitha,\n&gt;  Vallavacharya&#39;s Suddha Adwaitha - so many vari=\r\neties of philosophy. \n&gt; \n&gt; I have a personal view about judging philosophy.=\r\n For everything that one giant has said, there is always another one who ha=\r\ns said exactly the opposite. And a third and forth one who came up with a d=\r\nifferent view-point, differing with all the previous ones. And each of thes=\r\ne giants have spoken with the utmost conviction of their own realizations o=\r\nf truths. So personality and stature of the philosopher should play no role=\r\n in an objective analysis of the philosophy. Just like the personality and =\r\nstature of a mathematician is of no use in=A0 judging the correctness of a =\r\nmathematical theory.=A0 Spiritually, the reality is same (and it maybe a ve=\r\nry=A0 complex reality). But philosophically each have differences which can=\r\nnot the ignored. In such an intellectual climate, in my personal opinion, i=\r\nt is fair enough to discard one philosophy for another, after a thorough an=\r\nd detailed contemplation of the pros and cons. \n&gt; \n&gt; From a spiritual view-=\r\npoint all this is utterly meaningless. Which ever spiritual giant one choos=\r\nes to hang on to, if sincere faith, reverence and effort is engaged, surely=\r\n progress will happen in time. But philosophy is a another matter. \n&gt; \n&gt; [T=\r\no make my stand clearer, let me say hypothetically that IF by some strange =\r\nmiracle of God, Sri Adi Shankara were to come and stand infornt of me, I wo=\r\nuld have no qualms about falling at his feet and bowing down to him and ask=\r\ning for his blessings, for his spiritual stature is unquestionable. Yet I w=\r\nill still not be agreeable to the philosophy he propagated during the time =\r\nhe lived.] \n&gt; \n&gt; -Best=A0 Regards \n&gt; =A0Rajarshi \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; awaktam wya=\r\nktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah | \n&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanut=\r\ntamam ||[7:24] \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ___________________________________\n&gt; \n&gt; From: vedi=\r\nc_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; \n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Sent: Th=\r\nursday, 11 October 2012 10:32 PM \n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: A thought \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; =A0 Dear Rajarshi, \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Yet, I have equally no qualms in rejecting=\r\n his philosophy&lt;&lt;&lt; \n&gt; \n&gt; actually &quot;rejecting&quot; may not be the right word you=\r\n probably mistakenly used.

I hope yo=\r\nur health is fine too. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I will answer the points you have raised i=\r\nn your mail below, to the best of my ability. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; S=\r\no is there a place for Divine Mother and Her Love or Grace or Protection in=\r\n your theory. Is=C2 this intermediate zone as you say is created by Her \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; and part of Her creation=C2 or by=C2 somebody else. &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There is=\r\n no other somebody else in the Universe apart from Her. Even the worst Asur=\r\na is also Her creation to sustain this world, for reasons only She knows, b=\r\necause Her perspective/vision is way beyond even the sharpest human mind. N=\r\nobody, can understand mentally, all of Her actions, for She is truly the On=\r\ne whose energy has created the Universe of diversity, She lies hidden insid=\r\ne it as well as beyond it, awaiting patiently to be discovered, extending H=\r\ner love, truth, force and power to the aid of anyone who calls Her sincerel=\r\ny and unconditionally, yet allowing every creature the liberty to act as pe=\r\nr its own understanding, for causes apparently good or the apparently bad. =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;Does=C2 She needs some visa \n&gt; &gt; to go there if she is=C2 not t=\r\nhe Creater.=C2 As you say all higher deity are \n&gt; &gt; there but less in abili=\r\nty. Does the deities have even less =C2 ability on \n&gt; &gt; earth plane.&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; She needs no visa, but neither does She interfere without a genuine c=\r\nause or a genuine call. Everything is Her world, then why is there ugliness=\r\n, crime, evil things? Who creates the Asuras, if not She? And it is She her=\r\nself who gave them the liberty to act as per their freewill. This world is =\r\na play of forces and a democracy of opportunities. Every impulse, however D=\r\nivine or anti-Divine in aim, is given a chance to run its course and actual=\r\nize itself in the Universe. THAT is Her Divine Compassion! That is why She =\r\nis THE GREATEST Mother. She is mother to the Great Gods as much to the Dana=\r\nvas and Daityas, and Rakshasas and Bhutas and Pretas and other corrupt huma=\r\nn being and what not. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now coming to your question on the phrase &quot;=\r\nhigher deities having less ability&quot;. I think I have not been able to explai=\r\nn clearly, since in the last mail I was merely writing in the context of th=\r\nat discussion. Let me try here. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There are three basic layer of th=\r\nis Universe. The physical, the astral or subtle layer, and the causal (kara=\r\nna jagat) layer. In this subtle layer, which lies superimposed on our own p=\r\nhysical plane, there is a whole wide world of all possible forces, just lik=\r\ne in our own world. It is a layer which is created out of force of pranasha=\r\nkti. This force of pranashakti in humans beings is what causes all emotive =\r\nmovements on the consciousness - joy, happiness, love, passion, rage, fear,=\r\n anger, hatred, disgust, lust, attachments etc etc. These are also capable =\r\nof influencing the thinking mind is us. Now the core philosophy of sadhana =\r\nand specially Tantrik sadhana, is to create a formation of the deity using =\r\nones own prana-shakti through the aid of repeated rituals and procedures an=\r\nd mantras etc. If you think carefully, you will realize that every idol, ev=\r\ner homa agni needs a pranapratisthapana ritual before starting. The sadhaka=\r\n used the force of his/her=A0 own \n&gt; &gt;=A0 pranashakti to infuse life into a=\r\n subtle formation of the deity. Once this process is successfully done, thi=\r\ns sublte formation of the deity which exists in the subtle plane, has a lif=\r\ne of its own. It can then guide the sadhaka through the path and eventually=\r\n, one day lead him/her to the real abode of the deity which is the karana-j=\r\nagat (beyond this astral plane). If a person is able to awaken his/her Kund=\r\nalini shakti, and make it identify/create such an astral formation of the d=\r\neity, it becomes an even more powerful force. It is, from our limited human=\r\n perspective, as much a powerful entity as we may imagine, yet it is often =\r\nnot the actual Deity yet. Exactly the same thing has been described by Sri =\r\nVimalananda in the Aghora books, if you read carefully.=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Whe=\r\nn a sadhaka has been able to associate with such an astral formation of the=\r\n deity, it can guide the sadhaka along the path provided the sadhaka also i=\r\ns trying to work hard and sincerely to reach the causal planes (the real sp=\r\niritual planes of existence where the real force of the Deity originates). =\r\nThe difference, if you ask, between this astral formation of the deity and =\r\nthe real deity is that, the former is neither bound nor capable by itself o=\r\nf causing a complete and total transformation of the average human nature w=\r\nithout a proactive help of the sadhaka. Whereas, if one reaches the plane o=\r\nf the Great Gods, which is where the real deity exists, one cannot avoid be=\r\ning transformed in mind, emotions, body etc. And what kind of a transformat=\r\nion will it be? One that will reflect to the world as a greater and genuine=\r\n humility, sense of deep surrender to the Divine at ALL time and unfailingl=\r\ny, a complete withdrawal of lower nature of man - lust,=A0\n&gt;  anger, \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n=A0 jealousy, greed, covetousness - an abiding peace, calm, detachment, men=\r\ntal-illumination, genuine compassion, a widening of the consciousness. Such=\r\n an individual, even if he/she just sits down next to another person, will =\r\nexude a silent strong peace and unselfish love which will automatically cal=\r\nm the minds and disturbed emotions of lesser mortals ETC. THAT is the authe=\r\nntic, unhindered flow of the Divine Power of any of the great deities. This=\r\n comes even if one deity is properly realized in the causal planes of exist=\r\nence. But the astral formation of the same deity, which is created by the f=\r\norce of our own pranashakti or Kundalini as the case maybe, is often not ca=\r\npable of affecting this kind of a total transformation in a sadhaka. That i=\r\ns why it is limited. It is not limited because it can&#39;t=C2=A0 get me a bett=\r\ner job or a nice pay hike or cure some diseases or bring me fame or any suc=\r\nh material benefit if I so ask of it - the astral formations of=A0 the\n&gt;  d=\r\neities \n&gt; &gt;=A0 can very easily do all these things in the physical world - =\r\nbut it is limited because it cannot by itself give you the must authentic a=\r\nnd persistent spirituality of the higher planes, the one aim and destinatio=\r\nn of all genuine sadhana. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Since this astral plane is the way it i=\r\ns, therefore it&#39;s extremely important to keep actively working on ourselves=\r\n to increase detachment, objectivity, genuine internal surrender (when that=\r\n happens one accepts all life-situations without the slightest grudge), hum=\r\nility, control of anger, lust, jealousy etc. (all that is universally accep=\r\nted as spiritual qualities). For unless these changes are affected at least=\r\n to some degree in the mind and emotions of the sadhaka, one is simply not =\r\nready to reach the higher planes of God and benefit from them spiritually. =\r\nMoreover, at every stage of spiritual evolution there is a gap between expe=\r\nrience and realization. Only repeated experiences *may* lead to realization=\r\n. One off experiences create a force no doubt, but in time it fritters away=\r\n, or worst, gets distorted by the impurities and conditioning of the sadhak=\r\na. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;I am sure this is not your \n&gt; &gt; theory. You have taken it fr=\r\nom yogi Aurobindo. Many times when certain \n&gt; &gt; person reach a stage in the=\r\nir spiritual path, others think whatever this guy is uttering is=C2 complet=\r\ne truth, when in fact it is=C2 far from truth. \n&gt; &gt; Once=C2 I saw in a arti=\r\ncle that Aurobindo said that Divine Lord who spoke \n&gt; &gt; Gita completely for=\r\ngot it after few minutes or so. I could not believe \n&gt; &gt; what I was reading=\r\n. Then my respect for this yogi went down the drain.&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You surety=\r\n is incorrect. There were certain events which happened in the last one and=\r\n half years which made me sit down and rethink my own understanding of spir=\r\nituality. At about the same time I started worshiping a specific personalit=\r\ny of the Divine Mother, and the more I meditated on Her, the more would tho=\r\nughts pour into my mind that my understanding of spirituality is imperfect =\r\nand has serious flaws. I tried, using my own meditations to find out what w=\r\nas wrong or rather imperfectly understood, what needed rethinking. First qu=\r\nestion I asked myself was, what is the aim of spirituality? My mind could g=\r\nrasp some outlines of certain answers and processes and truths. But it was =\r\nstill not exceptionally clear. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I had first read Sri Aurobindo whe=\r\nn I was in college. I could not go beyond the first two pages. They were bo=\r\nuncers going one mile over my head. Three years ago someone gave me a book =\r\nof Sri Aurobindo. I could understand say 10 percent, and rest I rejected, p=\r\nartly due to ignorance and partly due to egoistic arrogance. Never opened a=\r\nny of his writing since then. This year, as my sadhana was going on and as =\r\nI was instinctively trying to correct the flaws in my understanding, one da=\r\ny while meditating I had an inner thought in the form of an image, which to=\r\nld me that I should start reading Sri Aurobindo but in a very specific mann=\r\ner. The image was very clear in my inner-eye, and thoroughly pressing on my=\r\n consciousness. I opened his book again, and read it in the prescribed mann=\r\ner and this time it made a LOT of sense to me. What I was struggling to und=\r\nerstand all this year, whose outline I could grasp yet not get a proper han=\r\ng of, I was able to=A0 understand \n&gt; &gt;=A0 from his writings with much deepe=\r\nr clarity.=C2=A0 Many of my own experiences made more sense to me. Many sen=\r\ntences of Aghora books too made amply sense in a new light. I read 40 - 45 =\r\n% of his writings. Then something in me told me to stop at a certain point =\r\nof his writings, for digesting the rest of the 60 % I will have to first ma=\r\nke more spiritual progress. Otherwise the rational mind will distort the in=\r\nformation. So I stopped. He whom I had rejected firmly 3 years ago, now cam=\r\ne back to sit on my consciousness like a blazing sun. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The line th=\r\nat you mention, is from one of the earlier writings of Sri Aurobindo on the=\r\n historical problem of the Mahabharta. In the Mahabharata, there is an inci=\r\ndent which comes later on, after the great war and when Yudhisthira was rul=\r\ning the kingdom happily, when Arjuna asks Sri Krishna to repeat the words h=\r\ne had spoken at the beginning of the war (The Gita) once more since he has =\r\nforgotten them, and Sri Krishna says, the time has passed away (it was a sp=\r\necial time when the Gita was spoken), he cannot repeat the &quot;exact words&quot; on=\r\nce again. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sri Krishna was the main Guru of Aurobindo. Even Swami =\r\nVivekananda was one of his Gurus, for during the time when Sri Aurobindo wa=\r\ns in jail, for 15 days Swami Vivekananda would appear before him daily and =\r\ninstruct him on the various layers of the mind, which he was not aware of t=\r\nill then. Swami Vivekananda had already left his physical body by then. It =\r\nwas in the writings of Sri Aurobindo that he mentioned about the left and r=\r\night hemisphere of the brain and their difference in functionality, and the=\r\nir connection to spirituality, about 30 years before medical science confir=\r\nmed the same. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Right from getting out of jail, to settling in Pond=\r\nicherry, to pushing his own spiritual experiences further into states of Sa=\r\nhaja (which he describes in different terminology), etc etc, he was guided =\r\ncontinuously by the Adesha of Sri Krishna. He would literally hear the voic=\r\ne of Krishna speaking to him, instructing him to do this or do that. Krishn=\r\na was his Guru, the Divine Mother beyond all manifestation, was his destina=\r\ntion. Anyway, my point is not to try and sell Sri Aurobindo&#39;s perspective o=\r\nf spirituality. I have benefited from it, but not necessary that everyone e=\r\nlse will also benefit. There are so many sadgurus who have come to India, e=\r\nach with their unique perspectives and ideas and philosophies. Each must in=\r\ndividually try and find whose ideas gel properly with our mental and emotio=\r\nnal makeup, and help us to progress on the path. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Though I now hav=\r\ne a very deep respect for Sri Aurobindo, I maintain a safe distance from bo=\r\nth his critics and his blind-admirers. Both of them, in my opinion, have mi=\r\nsunderstood the depth of his teachings. Both their love and their hatred is=\r\n a function of their own egos, like it was mine 3 years ago, and not based =\r\non any genuine understanding or appreciation. In spirituality, no Sadguru c=\r\nan be understood accurately or even slightly without sincere sadhana. \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; \n&gt; &gt; Disclaimer---- My thinking is \n&gt; &gt; very different due to =\r\nDarshan and=C2 Grace of Divine Mother & Divine \n&gt; &gt; Lord. Nobody should fee=\r\nl unhappy If I do not agree or follow the \n&gt; &gt; leader.Thanks.&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I=\r\n at-least will never feel unhappy if you disagree. There are \n&gt; &gt; many sain=\r\nts, many philosophies, many paths, not everyone is bound to \n&gt; &gt; like every=\r\n path.=C2=A0 Disagreement is perfectly ok. Because someone \n&gt; &gt; disagrees w=\r\nith me or those whom I agree with, does not mean I like him \n&gt; &gt; any less. =\r\nI try to keep my=C2=A0 emotional side (where respect, love, \n&gt; &gt; dislike, h=\r\natred, anger, passions exist) separate from my thinking mind. \n&gt; &gt; It is ve=\r\nry much possible, through practice, for a man to disassociate \n&gt; &gt; his rati=\r\nonal-mind from the emotional-mind. So have no fears that your \n&gt; &gt; disagree=\r\nment is going to make me like you any less or any more. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The probl=\r\nem with the emotional part of our being is that it jumps up at appearances,=\r\n running ahead to grasp the truth rather than waiting patiently for the tru=\r\nth to arrive in all its aspects and dimensions, and in the process it disto=\r\nrts the truth and then reacts to that distorted image. For example, recentl=\r\ny in some social forums I posted a comment that I found the Tantrik Adwaith=\r\na far more appealing than Sri Adi Shankara&#39;s Adwaitha, though the Adwaitha =\r\nof Adi Shankara has many hard-selling supporters. Immediately some friends =\r\nof mine on Twitter and otherwise, jumped to the false conclusion that I hav=\r\ne disrespected Adi Shankara, and tried best to make me &quot;see the truth&quot; by s=\r\nuch grandiose statements that=C2=A0 Shankara is the &#39;final word&#39; on Adwaith=\r\na and everything else must be necessarily lesser. Or that I was making an e=\r\ngoistic denouncement. Both of which are million light-years away from the t=\r\nruth. That Sri Adi Shankara was a special Vibhuti \n&gt; &gt;=A0 (manifestation) o=\r\nf God, that much I am certain. His compositions are so brilliant that it ca=\r\nn&#39;t be sufficiently appreciated in words. Yet, I have equally no qualms in =\r\nrejecting his philosophy. And because I am not bound to accept his philosop=\r\nhy, does not mean I respect or love him any less than any other great saint=\r\n.=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you disrespect a man, and specially a saint, and then =\r\nstart disliking him too with a passion, you are creating strong negative ka=\r\nrmas. But if you can disagree with someone without losing respect or love f=\r\nor the person, in an objective manner, you reap very little karmic effects.=\r\n That is why Lord Krishna too advices us to become more detached in life. \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In conclusion, Narasimha is totally correct. Many things cannot be=\r\n sufficiently expressed in words without causing some distortion. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n -Regards \n&gt; &gt; =C2 Rajarshi \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; awaktam wyaktimApann=\r\nam manyantE mAmabuddhayah | \n&gt; &gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam |=\r\n|[7:24] \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ________________________________ \n&gt; &gt;=A0 From: Laxmi=\r\n Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; To: &quot; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt; vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, 11 October 2012 12:21 AM \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: A thought \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi Bhai, \n&gt; &gt; How are you doing? About 200 hund=\r\nred years ago, a man made a theory of creation in France. When Napolean ask=\r\ned where is God in it, the guy said, do not talk about God. It makes things=\r\n complicated. \n&gt; &gt; So is there a place for Divine Mother and Her Love or Gr=\r\nace or Protection in your theory. Is=C2 this intermediate zone as you say i=\r\ns created by Her and part of Her creation=C2 or by=C2 somebody else.=C2=A0 =\r\nDoes=C2 She needs some visa to go there if she is=C2 not the Creater.=C2 As=\r\n you say all higher deity are there but less in ability. Does the deities h=\r\nave even less =C2 ability on earth plane. \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; I am sure this i=\r\ns not your theory. You have taken it from yogi Aurobindo. Many times when c=\r\nertain person reach a stage in their spiritual path, others think whatever =\r\nthis guy is uttering is=C2 complete truth, when in fact it is=C2 far from t=\r\nruth. Once=C2 I saw in a article that Aurobindo said that Divine Lord who s=\r\npoke Gita completely forgot it after few minutes or so. I could not believe=\r\n what I was reading. Then my respect for this yogi went down the drain. \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; Divine Mother, Her Love, Her Grace Her Protection and other E=\r\nternal Divine Beings are outside of our human perception. They only allow u=\r\ns to know about Themselves what They wish to. For me there is a=C2 differen=\r\nce between a yogi and devotee.=C2=A0 A devotee rises due to Grace of Divine=\r\n Mother or their Ishtdav. where as a yogi rises after a lot of huff and fuf=\r\nf, and they get stuck everywhere. I am sure there are only=C2 devotee in th=\r\nis group. They may be doing haven or japa or other devotional work. \n&gt; &gt; So=\r\n nobody should=C2 feel any sort of fear or pressure even for one second bec=\r\nause there is no such hocus pocus zone to cross and there is Grace of Divin=\r\ne Mother on all Her children. \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; Thanks \n&gt; &gt; LaxmiNarayan \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; Disclaimer---- My thinking is very di=\r\nfferent due to Darshan and=C2 Grace of Divine Mother & Divine Lord.

Otherwise it does not help. And the only parameters of judgement =\r\nis to objectively see what changes are happening in our surface, day-to-day=\r\n consciousness.That is are we less angry, more equanimous, etc etc. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; The field of experiences - visions, sights, sounds etc etc - is VAST. So=\r\nme of it can be genuine and plenty non-genuine. It is a complex study in it=\r\nself. Most spiritual people have never gone in depth trying to analyse and =\r\nunderstand these things properly, but some pattern is observable.=C2=A0 Not=\r\n all experiences are what they seem to be. Many yogis have lost themselves =\r\nin this jungle of experiences, not being able to adequately determine which=\r\n is genuine and which is non-genuine. This is the world of astral \n&gt; &gt;=A0 p=\r\nlane, driven by the overlapping shealths of pranamayakosha and parts of man=\r\nomayakosha of a human being. In Tantrik terminology, the areas rules by the=\r\n overlapping influence (overlapping and not discreet) of swadhisthana to an=\r\nahata. Everything=C2=A0 is possible here. Every higher deity has a correspo=\r\nnding lesser manifestation in this realm, but limited in ability. Similarly=\r\n there are endless beings of varies character and hue who can very easily c=\r\nreate an expereince for a sadhaka to delude him/her off the path. They can =\r\neven fake an experience/aura of a higher deity and, in extreme cases, take =\r\nhold of a seeker and use him/her for its own advantage. It is a whole wide =\r\nworld, the lower extreme of which causes, in a normal human being, a cement=\r\ning of a surface ego driven by attractions, desires, dreams, personal sub-c=\r\nonscious ambitions, jealousy, lust, anger (which is nothing but lust suppre=\r\nssed) etc etc and at the other extreme this layer can, if=A0\n&gt;  properly \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;=A0 channalized as is done in genuine Vaishava Bhakti, it can make one ex=\r\nperience Divine Ananda and manifest the &quot;antaratmah&quot; as an unfailing guide =\r\nto the path. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In a nutshell, a genuine &quot;experience&quot; is good and au=\r\nthentic only to the extent that it helps to modify and transform your wakin=\r\ng surface personality. That is the only true test. Rest all the range of ex=\r\nperiences that come from this realm, and 95 percent of Yogis get experience=\r\ns ONLY from this realm, are just sound and fury without substance. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; In the writings of Sri Aurobindo, he calls it the intermediate zone, whic=\r\nh has destroyed innumerable yogis who have got swept away by the light and =\r\nsound of this realm. One sure-shot way to cross this realm, and all sadhaka=\r\ns will have to cross this some day, is to hang on tightly to the fundamenta=\r\nls. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Regards \n&gt; &gt; =C2 Rajarshi \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; awaktam wyaktimApan=\r\nnam manyantE mAmabuddhayah | \n&gt; &gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam =\r\n||[7:24] \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom=\r\n@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, 9 October 2012 9:07 AM \n&gt; &gt; Subject: [v=\r\nedic-wisdom] Re: A thought \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi, \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; A sage &quot;sms&quot; indeed!

A life so transformed and so away from our ave=\r\nrage superficial existence, that it becomes a fulfillment on its own. God i=\r\ns not the finish line of a bicycle race. It is the progressive unfolding of=\r\n a transformation process. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Complex rituals and speedy sadhana=\r\ns and experiences et al are ok, provided one does not \n&gt; &gt;=A0 lose sight of=\r\n the fundamentals. THEN these can be useful. Otherwise one ends up running =\r\nin circles and going nowhere. An experience-chaser is not necessary a spiri=\r\ntual entity.
