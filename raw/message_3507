How can=\r\n i\n&gt; &gt; again experience the Beloved.\n&gt; &gt; That then is the experience of man=\r\ntra when it is done correctly.\n&gt; &gt; When the sadhak&#39;s personality is effaced=\r\n such that the deity&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; personality sits there then the sadhak experienc=\r\nes himself as that\n&gt; &gt; Deity(Devata) .\n&gt; &gt; There then arises no difference =\r\nin the sadhak or the deity commanding a\n&gt; &gt; certain thing to happen( be it =\r\nwhat appears to be good or be it that\n&gt; &gt; which appears to be bad) . The de=\r\nity&#39;s personality is crucial. Ugra\n&gt; &gt; devatas make the person care almost =\r\nfor nothing himself, so self\n&gt; &gt; identification is minimised and the person=\r\n&#39;s spiritual evolution\n&gt; &gt; continues.\n&gt; &gt; Remember, there is=C2 very little=\r\n=C2 according to me which is black magic.\n&gt; &gt; It is all a use of Shakti. If=\r\n your Shakti and deity is a higher shakti\n&gt; &gt; such as Prachand Chandika, Ma=\r\nhaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your power\n&gt; &gt; will be that of God himself(=\r\n Provided you have Vijnana). After the death\n&gt; &gt; of the body, such a sadhak=\r\na joins the realm of the deity or if he was\n&gt; &gt; originally a Nath or a Muni=\r\n goes to a separate realm reserved for these\n&gt; &gt; beings.\n&gt; &gt; Attacking such=\r\n a sadhak brings the full bearing of karma onto the heads\n&gt; &gt; of the attack=\r\ners and some people may realise this to their detriment(\n&gt; &gt; Patan comes fr=\r\nom Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Patan with his\n&gt; &gt; Shakti causing an =\r\nearthquake). Some people may even equate this with\n&gt; &gt; black magic. Here th=\r\nere is only action and reaction.(Bit like you attack\n&gt; &gt; a normal person, a=\r\nnd you will get a result of this from that same Atma\n&gt; &gt; whom you harmed ma=\r\nybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack\n&gt; &gt; somebody who is identify=\r\ning with the universe and has very few karmas\n&gt; &gt; left, then the Universe i=\r\ntself attacks you, because your attack is not\n&gt; &gt; on the sadhaka, but on hi=\r\ns identification, ie God or the universe).\n&gt; &gt; If people persist in using t=\r\nhe Shakti possesed by a small Pisacha,\n&gt; &gt; Bhuta, then there is only a litt=\r\nle Shakti which can be used, moreover=C2\n&gt; &gt; then their minds and intellect=\r\ns will not be free of identification with\n&gt; &gt; the body and so their actions=\r\n are those which are generally termed as\n&gt; &gt; black magic. These people usua=\r\nlly join the same spirits which they have\n&gt; &gt; been using after death, this =\r\nis not an enjoyable experience.\n&gt; &gt; Imagine if somebody is worshipping Chan=\r\ndika for a few lifetimes, then\n&gt; &gt; even in this birth he or she is drawn to=\r\n that deity and such a sadhak\n&gt; &gt; may acheive after a few repitions of a ma=\r\nntra(because of his previous\n&gt; &gt; effort).\n&gt; &gt; On the other hand somebody do=\r\ning this mantra only in this lifetime may\n&gt; &gt; feel that the 64 things which=\r\n bind every mantra are crucial and may not\n&gt; &gt; acheive in this lifetime.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; According to me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let me\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nsuggest an easy sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; If one is so inclined, then starting on some g=\r\nood day, do 1000\n&gt; &gt; reititions of the Savitri(some=C2 call this the=C2 Gay=\r\natri, but the real\n&gt; &gt; Gayatri is hidden) every day, main constraints\n&gt; &gt; S=\r\name time every day.\n&gt; &gt; Same place.\n&gt; &gt; Same materials.\n&gt; &gt; Same direction.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; As little movement as one can.\n&gt; &gt; Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is y=\r\nour inclination.\n&gt; &gt; Complete restraint on sex(from the mind and the body, =\r\nnot just the\n&gt; &gt; body), reduce food intake, grow a beard.\n&gt; &gt; Do not eat 2 =\r\nhrs before you start, make sure your bowels are empty\n&gt; &gt; before you start.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Continue this for 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 times.\n&gt; &gt; Se=\r\ne the difference in your personality before and after.\n&gt; &gt; Long and short ,=\r\n what is important is that life may be short, so do some\n&gt; &gt; sadhana, and p=\r\nersist with that sadhana for as long as is physically\n&gt; &gt; possible.\n&gt; &gt; I h=\r\nope this clarifies some of the concepts which were being discussed.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Kind Love and Regards\n&gt; &gt; manish\n&gt; &gt; You may post this on the list as =\r\na clarification from me if you feel\n&gt; &gt; that this is suitable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
