Do you know him as a friend a=\r\nnd is he a Indian? What\nsort of path/sadhana is he following?? Is he a sann=\r\nyasin or a\nhouseholder ?Did specific changes happened in his life after=C2 =\r\n he had\nthese samadhi and visions.Any other special things about him.\n&gt; =C2=\r\n\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Yes he is a friend of mine.=C2  I can only tell you very little ab=\r\nout\nhis spiritual life, because he hardly ever shares it with anyone. He is=\r\n\nmarried, lives in Delhi and has a son as well.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Before I tell you a=\r\nnything more=C2 about his spiritual life=C2 that\nI know, let me say=C2 line=\r\n or two about the nature of this friend of\nmine. I met him about two years =\r\nback. What first attracted me to=C2 \ntowards him was his impeccable honestl=\r\ny. I mean, he is a maniac=C2 when\nit comes to=C2 honestly.=C2 If someone we=\r\nre to put a gun to his head\nand ask him to just say a simple, harmless=C2 l=\r\nie, like sun rises in\nthe west, he would not say it. Therefore he never jok=\r\nes with anyone too!\nHe has actually never ever=C2 spoken even a single lie =\r\nin his whole\nlife, big or small. When he was in his school, once his teache=\r\nr told him\nthat Indian languages are richer than English, he believed his t=\r\neacher.\nLater someone else told him English is more comprehensive language =\r\nand\nthe world cannot do with it. He got confused. Since that day, he bought=\r\n\nhimself two thick fat dictionaries, one English, one Hindi and for ten\nyea=\r\nrs every day he spend one hour reading the English dictionary and\n&gt; one hou=\r\nr reading the Hindi dictionary apart from reading=C2 up\nvolumes of Hindi an=\r\nd English literature.=C2 When I asked him why, he\njust said it is because h=\r\ne wanted to be=C2 equally adept at both the\nlanguages so that one day he ca=\r\nn take a really detached view to judge\nthe truth about=C2 which is more com=\r\nprehensive language! As I said, he\nhas an uncompromising attitude when it c=\r\nomes to finding out the truth\nabout anything. By education, he is a Phd is =\r\nmathematics. He has worked\nin different fields, from banking to education t=\r\no journalism. He did not\nlast for long in most places. He speaks and writes=\r\n fluently, English,\nBengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, French=\r\n. Now he is\nlearning Tamil. He composes poetry in all the above languages. =\r\nWhen he\nwas in college, he considered himself an atheist. While applying fo=\r\nr a\njob he had kept the place makered for religion as blank. When the clerk=\r\n\nwho was supposed to take the forms saw that blank space, he asked\n&gt; my fri=\r\nend&#39;s name. Hearing a Hindu name, the clerk wrote &quot;Hindu&quot;.\nSeeing this, my =\r\nfriend snatched the form from the clerk and tore it up\nright there. Because=\r\n, he considered himself an atheist and writing Hindu\nin the form would have=\r\n been a lie.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; So this gives a basic idea of the man I am speaking of=\r\n. All his\nfriends, whoever knows him, calls him Rama of Kaliyuga.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; O=\r\nne day, long back, he was going to office for some urgent meeting.\nHis way =\r\nto office passed by a Krishna temple. As he was passing by\nin=C2 his scoote=\r\nr, suddenly he felt a strange urge to go into the\ntemple. He says he still =\r\ndoes not know why he went inside the temple,\nbut he did. That was at 9 o cl=\r\nock in the morning. Next when he sees his\nwatch it is 4:30 in the evening! =\r\nAnd he has no knowledge of how the time\nwent. When he asked the priest, the=\r\n priest said that he went into the\ntemple sat down and just stayed as he wa=\r\ns for the whole time without any\nmovement. The priest somehow felt scared t=\r\no disturb him. But my friend\nhad no idea why this happened. He remembered n=\r\nothing, as if he was in\ndeep sleep.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Then he started meditating at h=\r\nome, and it was there=C2 that he got\nvisions etc of Krishna. He does not sa=\r\ny much about these, infact most\npeople who know him also do not know these =\r\nthings. But once he was in\nsamadhi for 72 hours, not moving from his medita=\r\ntion seat, in the exact\nsame place and same position for 3 days continuousl=\r\ny.=C2 Only his wife\nand close relatives know about this incident. I believe=\r\n nowadays when\never he sits for meditation he often enters the state of Sam=\r\nadhi. When\nsomeone asked him how he felt during samadhi, he just said it fe=\r\nels as\nif the whole universe orginates from me. I am the sun, the moon, the=\r\n\nstars, the planets, the animals, men, women, children, the wind, the\nwater=\r\n, the space, smaller than the atom and bigger than everything. It\ncannot be=\r\n accurately desribed.=C2 He considers Sri Krishna to be God\nand=C2 Lord Ram=\r\na to be the ideal man.That is why he does not like the\nRamacharit Manas bec=\r\nause he thinks it elevated Sri=C2 Rama to the\n&gt; level of a God whereas the =\r\naim of the orginal Valmiki Ramayana was to\nshow Sri Rama as an ideal man,=\r\n=C2 not a God.The difference he says is\nthat, an ideal man is someone who c=\r\nan be emulated, an ordinary man can\nand should aim to become like the ideal=\r\n. But a God cannot be emulated by\nordinary men. One cannot become Krishna, =\r\nbut one=C2 can try to lead his\nlife like Rama. I have argued with him over =\r\nthis, but I am merely\nstating his idea. Also he does not have a Guru - a hu=\r\nman guru at least,\nand advises people to not trust most Gurus these days. N=\r\needless to say,\nhe is not an atheist any more.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Later he had once=C2=\r\n mentioned he knew the relation he had with all\nthe people around him in hi=\r\ns past lives. His mother he says, was his\ndaughter in his past life etc. No=\r\nwadays he spends a lot of time on\ndifferent internet forums interacting wit=\r\nh people, specially=C2 with\nthose in=C2 the age group of 18 to 30, discussi=\r\nng anything and\neverything with them, from Indian politics to Indian histor=\r\ny, religion,\netc etc. His idea is to impart right knowledge to young people=\r\n who will\nbe the future of this country.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; He is am omnivorous person=\r\n. Like any other Bengali, eats fish, meat\netc.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; I shall refrain from=\r\n mentioning his name because I had not asked his\npermission before mentioni=\r\nng him.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C2 Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; PS: I would not like this mai=\r\nl to be considered as a part of the\ndebate.

Then prasdam all around??&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; My curious questions are not against your acceptance of hi=\r\ns exexperienceut to learn more.After all he is part of hidden violence.

Simple dal/roti and do not even=\r\n touch onion/garlic/ pepper but no such samadhi? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When we =\r\nget burnt, we need to be careful.Many years ago I saw in a book/article=C2&=\r\nnbsp; about Dayamata who succeded=C2&nbsp; Paramhansa Yoganand.

No outright solutio=\r\nns for so many difficult questions. Followers of 3 faiths which all origina=\r\nted in middle east are fighting each other all the time. Sometimes I think,=\r\n from which part of Spiritual Sky these energies are coming,Are they also e=\r\nnemies there?? Their Gods said in their holy books that animals are their f=\r\nood. So they cannot even think about souls in animals or their pain and emo=\r\ntions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Then I have read stories about several people, who =\r\nfollow these faiths and are non-veg and how they exexperience=C2&nbsp; spir=\r\nitual highs and other such phenomena.
