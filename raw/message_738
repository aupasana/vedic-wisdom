Nice quote from Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.\n\nI want to say more on one statement:\n\n&gt; When a person thinks he is so pure that the Lord talks\n&gt; to him personally,and that they are a direct vehicle\n&gt; to serve the Lord.\n&gt; that is good indication the person is suffering from a\n&gt; certain level of delusion/maya.\n\nThat is a good indication but not a conclusive proof.\n\nSomeone like Ramakrishna Paramahamsa may mention many times that Kali told \nhim this or Kali told him that. At a casual observation, he may seem like a \nproud person suffering from delusion. But he may have no such pride.\n\nSimilarly, someone else may talk very humbly and very sweetly. But all that \nmay be a facade. The person may be internally quite proud of his purity and \neven proud of how humble and saattwik he thinks he is. At a casual \nobservation, he may seem like a very humble and saattwik person. But he may \nnot be.\n\nLet me give a simple analogy. One who watches a movie and narrates its story \nto another person is not necessarily deluded by the movie. He may have \nwatched the movie impassionately and be simply narrating the story to one \nwho is curious. On the contrary, someone else may claim &quot;oh, it&#39;s just a \nmovie. It&#39;s not real. Don&#39;t take it seriously&quot; and yet secretly feel \nexcitement in some scenes, fear in some scenes and sadness in some scenes \netc.\n\nOne&#39;s detachment and one&#39;s ego cannot be judged from one or two actions. \nOnly a careful observation over a period of time can reveal what motivates \none, what one&#39;s agenda is, how one thinks and potentially give clues \nregarding one&#39;s purity level. Actually, even after a long observation, one \nmay not be able to judge others. The best thing is not to judge the \nspiritual purity of others.\n\nAs I said before, we should focus internally. Each of us can analyze our own \nmind and its motivations. We should try to weed out pride from our actions, \nthoughts and instincts. Irrespective how we appear to the world and what \nothers think about is, each of us should be able to recognize pride with \nsome conscious intrpspection. We know what is going on in our mind.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Lakshmi Kary&quot; &lt;lakshmikary@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, December 07, 2008 1:12 AM\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Regarding Maha Ganapati Homam / Re-igniting \nFire\n\n\n&gt; Hare Rama Krishna\n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; These are my thoughts.Hope no one takes offense.\n&gt; The problem with &quot;I ness&quot; is that just by focusing on\n&gt; it, one becomes more aware of sense of self.\n&gt; The real cure for &quot;I ness&quot; is to serve others, focus\n&gt; on others.\n&gt; Serve God , be the servant of God , instead of\n&gt; oneself.\n&gt; Then.. the person is &quot;self less&quot; - which is the cure\n&gt; for too much &quot;I ness&quot;\n&gt; When one loves someone they spend all their mind and\n&gt; heart thinking and serving that person. If a  person\n&gt; is focusing constantly on the &quot;I ness&quot;  and on\n&gt; themselves it is pretty self oriented , the opposite\n&gt; of what is needed.. However sometimes, one has to\n&gt; realize how much &quot;I&quot; is there.\n&gt; When a person thinks he is so pure that the Lord talks\n&gt; to him personally,and that they are a direct vehicle\n&gt; to serve the Lord.\n&gt; that is good indication the person is suffering from a\n&gt; certain level of delusion/maya. In fact the world is\n&gt; full of people who are either deluding themselves or\n&gt; trying to delude others.\n&gt; But it doesn&#39;t matter because the Supreme Lord knows\n&gt; what is in everyones heart and has the perfect plan\n&gt; for our purification and realizations.Of course there\n&gt; are many paths to the same end.\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is one verse/quote from Lord Caitanya-\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;One should chant the holy name of the Lord in a\n&gt; humble state of mind,\n&gt; thinking oneself lower than the straw in the street;\n&gt; one should be more tolerant than a tree,\n&gt; devoid of all sense of false prestige,\n&gt; and should be ready to offer all respect to others.\n&gt; In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name\n&gt; of the Lord constantly.\n&gt; Best wishes\n&gt; Lakshmi\n&gt;\n&gt; --- &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Pride of vidya maya (the illusion of knowledge) is\n&gt;&gt; far better than pride of\n&gt;&gt; avidya maya (the illusion of ignorance). One who\n&gt;&gt; learns vedas, upanishad and\n&gt;&gt; vedangas and is proud of one&#39;s knowledge and one who\n&gt;&gt; engages in rituals and\n&gt;&gt; is proud of one&#39;s rituals, are better than many\n&gt;&gt; people who are in utter\n&gt;&gt; ignorance and yet proud of this or that. However, my\n&gt;&gt; point is that both are\n&gt;&gt; far away from realization.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; True knowledge is one that makes one lose pride.\n&gt;&gt; True knowledge is one that\n&gt;&gt; increases the surrender. True knowledge is one that\n&gt;&gt; does not bind further,\n&gt;&gt; but liberates one.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As you correctly pointed out, recognizing the\n&gt;&gt; problem of pride is the first\n&gt;&gt; step in improving. As you said, pride does not leave\n&gt;&gt; one even during\n&gt;&gt; spiritual sadhana! One may be proud of one&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; sadhana, even without fully\n&gt;&gt; realizing it consciously. One does not have to dig\n&gt;&gt; deep. One needs to only\n&gt;&gt; scratch the surface of one&#39;s mind, thoughts and\n&gt;&gt; instincts to see the lion of\n&gt;&gt; ego alive, kicking and roaring.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As long as one recognizes the problem and\n&gt;&gt; *consciously* tries to take the\n&gt;&gt; &quot;sarvam krishaarpanamastu&quot; statement at the end of\n&gt;&gt; rituals seriously and\n&gt;&gt; literally, one is on the right path and one will\n&gt;&gt; eventually overcome.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Manish keeps telling me, &quot;Narasimha, do not\n&gt;&gt; underestimate anyone. Each being\n&gt;&gt; in this universe has a birth right to liberation. If\n&gt;&gt; She wishes, a split\n&gt;&gt; second is enough to liberate one. Do not have any\n&gt;&gt; bias. There is a divine\n&gt;&gt; spark in *everyone*. Try to light that spark in\n&gt;&gt; people. Leave the rest to\n&gt;&gt; Her.&quot; Every person has a potential. Just some\n&gt;&gt; conscious effort is needed to\n&gt;&gt; fulfil that potential.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; First recognize pride and ego in your actions,\n&gt;&gt; thoughts and instincts. Then\n&gt;&gt; make a conscious effort to overcome it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself:\n&gt;&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself:\n&gt;&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality:\n&gt;&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3):\n&gt;&gt; http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows):\n&gt;&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website:\n&gt;&gt; http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Saturday, December 06, 2008 6:08 AM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Regarding Maha Ganapati\n&gt;&gt; Homam / Re-igniting Fire\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; namaste\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste Bharati !!!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I too thought about it the same way as you\n&gt;&gt; mentioned. but as you and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha Garu Mentioned, God&#39;ll decide our worth\n&gt;&gt; and why should we\n&gt;&gt; &gt; bother about that. we should be doing just HER\n&gt;&gt; work without any sense\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of pride and It is Much much much more difficult\n&gt;&gt; to achieve than\n&gt;&gt; &gt; said.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha has really made the difference with me\n&gt;&gt; and i am sure with\n&gt;&gt; &gt; many others as well. he has clarified some really\n&gt;&gt; nagging doubts. He\n&gt;&gt; &gt; has effectively convinced me that Pride is the one\n&gt;&gt; what needs to be\n&gt;&gt; &gt; controlled and finally annihilate. in my case,\n&gt;&gt; whenever i did some\n&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana, i would feel some pride which used to go\n&gt;&gt; unnoticed by me\n&gt;&gt; &gt; most of the times. Now atleast i&#39;ve started\n&gt;&gt; acknowledging it and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that, in my opinion is the first step. once you\n&gt;&gt; acknowledge some\n&gt;&gt; &gt; errors then only you can take a corrective steps.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He has also blew away a big burden from my heart\n&gt;&gt; and that is the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; burden of Longing for subtle experiences.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and there are some other things which was\n&gt;&gt; clarified very effectively\n&gt;&gt; &gt; which i would mention some other time.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the following sentences of his would be really\n&gt;&gt; inspirational for many\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Don&#39;t worry about mundane things like respect,\n&gt;&gt; disrespect,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;silliness, smartness, eloquence, disorganized\n&gt;&gt; writings etc. We are\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;not here to impress anyone, including our gurus or\n&gt;&gt; sishyas. We are\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;here to do sadhana, become pure, realize our\n&gt;&gt; mission, finish the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;mission and then give up the body.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; some ligther thought from me: During Havan, it is\n&gt;&gt; you and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; MahaGanapati (or some other deitiy). so even if\n&gt;&gt; some unwanted things\n&gt;&gt; &gt; happens, you can talk to the deity and say &quot;it is\n&gt;&gt; you who is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; performing through me so i need not worry. it is\n&gt;&gt; you who needs to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; worry about that afterall.
