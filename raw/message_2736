I-ness derived =\r\nfrom Ahamkara,Manas and Chitta has no innate power to Control any other ide=\r\na of the 35 Causal-ideas.\nReason:\nSoul is the only Truth and controller, ev=\r\nerything else has an unreal and derived existence. Thus, all the 35 ideas c=\r\no-ordinate with each other, and not control each other. \n\n2. A new-born chi=\r\nld or a person in Hypnotic-Trance, is able to use his sense-consciousness c=\r\noherently due to the astral-bodys&#39; sense of I-ness derived from Manas, that=\r\n coordinates the senses.\nHe has no Buddhi or discriminating faculty to inte=\r\nract with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tell it what to do - as you have p=\r\nroposed. Thus, Manas co-ordinates the senses due to its own sense of I-ness=\r\n, not due to Buddhi.\n\nI hope this clarifies.\n\nRegards,\nNitish\n\n--- In vedic=\r\n-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Out of the 19 or 35 attributes of individualized consciousness, which =\r\none gives the idea &quot;I am this&quot; or &quot;I am that&quot;? Of course, it is ahamkaraka =\r\nor I-ness or egosense or ego principle!\n&gt; \n&gt; Is one&#39;s idea of &quot;I am this&quot; l=\r\nimited to a physical body? Of course not! If someone says &quot;so and so person=\r\n is a terrible person&quot;, one may feel offended or if someone says &quot;so and so=\r\n person is a great person&quot;, one may feel elated. One&#39;s ahamkara or I-ness i=\r\ns identifying with the criticism or praise, even though nothing is being do=\r\nne to the physical body and only a name is being used. When somebody calls =\r\none by name from distance (as opposed to patting on the physical body and c=\r\nalling), one&#39;s consciousness may still think &quot;I am being called&quot; and one ma=\r\ny turn towards the caller. As in these examples, one&#39;s I-ness does of cours=\r\ne bind itself to more than a body.\n&gt; \n&gt; Suppose one gets a dream while slee=\r\nping. One may have forgotten totally about the physical body in the dream! =\r\nOne may think of something else as &quot;I&quot;. In dreams, one may see oneself as a=\r\n different body or may not even &quot;see&quot; onself, but still one may have the se=\r\nnse that so and so thing is happening to &quot;me&quot;. So, even when the mind is dr=\r\nawn away from the physical body, there is still a notion of &quot;I am this&quot; (I-=\r\nness) in a dream. That is ahamkara or I-ness or ego principle.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your id=\r\nea that ahamkara is limited to physical body is absolutely unacceptable. Ah=\r\namkara or I-ness extends beyond the physical body.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, your idea tha=\r\nt deities like Agni do not have ahamkara (I-ness) because they do not have =\r\nphysical bodies is incorrect. Of course, Agni does have an I-ness and think=\r\ns &quot;I am Agni and this is what I do&quot;. If he did not have that I-ness, he wou=\r\nld not do everything he does.\n&gt; \n&gt; Moreover, the 19 or 35 ideas of individu=\r\nalized consciousness do interact with each other, whether we use the word &quot;=\r\ncontrol&quot; for some of those interactions or not. For example, buddhi (intell=\r\nectual/ discriminating mind) judges various past experiences, interacts wit=\r\nh manas (sensory-motor mind) and tells it what to do. Then manas interacts =\r\nwith karmendriyas (organs of action) and makes them do various things. My b=\r\nuddhi determined what to write and my manas told my hands to type this and =\r\nI ended up typing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your point about &quot;what exists as a part cannot be t=\r\nhe whole&quot; is totally out of place. The sense of I-ness, the memories and co=\r\nnditioning, the logical mind, the sensory-motor mind, karmendriyas etc are =\r\nall different parts of individualized consciousness and they play different=\r\n roles while interacting with each other in different ways. Some of those i=\r\nnteractions may be deemed to be controls.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Am not mixing up the termi=\r\nnologies, though my mail didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; go in details.

There are different abstractions and breakd=\r\nowns of what happens in individualized consciousness. There are several sou=\r\nrces that speak of different aspects of this knowledge in slightly differen=\r\nt terms.

Your understanding is flawed.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. All ide=\r\nas including the idea of Ahamkara naturally belong to the ideational or cau=\r\nsal body, but Ahamkara must be overcome only in the physical body (See poin=\r\nt 5.). Astral or Causal-bodied beings (those without a physical/astral body=\r\n) don&#39;t have to fight with the idea of Ahamkara like we do.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Aham=\r\nkaara/ego controls manas and buddhi also. When manas (sensory-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ...the=\r\ny are all guided by the sense of I-ness. That sense of I-ness \n&gt; &gt; &gt; permea=\r\ntes through all layers of one&#39;s individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. W=\r\nhere did you read this up ?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There is a fine line between the sense=\r\n of I-ness attributed to the Individual Soul and the sense of I-ness derive=\r\nd through the idea of Ahamkara. Even after a Soul is freed of the three bod=\r\nies, the individuality of the Soul Atom is not destroyed (Resurrection impl=\r\nies that), while it has already given up the idea of Ahamkara including all=\r\n other ideas.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Individuality of a causal-bodied being is not due to=\r\n the idea of Ahamkara because &quot;What exists as a part cannot be the whole&quot;. =\r\nThus, the idea of Ahamkara, being one of the 35 ideas of the Causal-body, d=\r\noesn&#39;t account for neither controls the rest of the 34 ideas. Each idea is =\r\nindependent of another, without requiring another idea to act upon it - oth=\r\nerwise your buddhi would always interfere with the functioning of Mind or A=\r\nhamkara or the 5 functions of life-forces and so on.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Essentially, =\r\nthe 35 ideas of causal body are the basic causal forces and are not related=\r\n as cause-effect to each other. Thus, each is independent of the applicatio=\r\nn of the sense of I-ness derived from Ahamkara. Manas and Buddhi being two =\r\nof the Causal-ideas, their functioning as well as existence is not &quot;control=\r\nled&quot; nor &quot;derived&quot; in any way by the idea of Ahamkara. It is very clear whe=\r\nn we see those with sharpest Buddhi or Sharpest Mind still carrying Heavies=\r\nt Ahamkara, because they didn&#39;t work upon that particular idea.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; But ego/ahamkaara/ I-ness is the very basis of the entire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; indiv=\r\nidualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3. Well, as most Physical-bodied beings c=\r\nannot see through the Astral/causal cosmoses, it doesn&#39;t apply in the same =\r\nway to the finer Astral and Causal-bodied beings who can always pierce the =\r\nveil of Maya and see the human activities. Thus, what is &quot;the very basis&quot; o=\r\nf the entire individualized consciousness for a physical-bodied (unenlighte=\r\nned) being is not the same as for an astral/causal bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; An Ast=\r\nral-bodied being thinks of Manas/sense- consciousness as the very basis of =\r\nthe entire individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; A Causal-bodied being thinks o=\r\nf Chitta/perceptive- consciousness as the very basis of the entire individu=\r\nalized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; However, that individuality is of the Soul not de=\r\nrived from any idea, which is why it is not lost when the Astral being lose=\r\ns astral consciousness and reincarnates in the Physical body.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As a=\r\nn example, Devatas, with their finer bodies, are able to work through all t=\r\nhe beings in all their physical-bodies simultaneously (like Ganesh resides =\r\nin the Mooladhara, Agni digests the food, and so on..), never getting contr=\r\nolled by Ahamkara that would require them to say that this particular body =\r\nis &quot;my body&quot; or that one is mine - unless they incarnate in Physical bodies=\r\n themselves. Devatas are, however, Astral/Causal- bodied beings, so they wo=\r\nuld attempt to influence the Manas (Spirit-Possession) of the sense-bound w=\r\norshipper. Pretas on the other hand, would attempt to possess ones&#39; physica=\r\nl body as well as act out their Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Out of the four a=\r\nntahkaranas, chitta (remembering or conditioned \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mind) and ahamkaara =\r\n(ego or I-ness) are parts of the kaarana \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sareera (causal body) and r=\r\nemain till the end.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4. As per the resurrected Soul of Sri Yukteswa=\r\nr in Autobiography of a Yogi -\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Causal body is a matrix of 35 ideas=\r\n, that include 19 ideas comprising Astral body (Chitta, Manas, Buddhi, Aham=\r\nkara, 5 functions of knowledge, 5 functions of Action, 5 functions of life-=\r\nforce) and 16 ideas comprising Physical body (16 chemical elements).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Now, as we all know that Physical body expires as a whole, not just one =\r\nor two of the 16 elements comprising it go away at a time, Astral and Causa=\r\nl bodies are also cast off as a whole in the corresponding cosmic conscious=\r\nness - instead of different constituent ideas slipping out of it at differe=\r\nnt times. Chitta being the staging idea for all other modifications, can be=\r\n termed as the last to go, when the causal body is finally dropped - hence =\r\nI wrote as rising above Chitta.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thus, the idea of Ahamkara is boun=\r\nd with Gross Physical vibrations, \n&gt; &gt; Manas with Subtle Astral vibrations =\r\nand \n&gt; &gt; Chitta with infinitely Subtle Causal Vibrations.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Buddhi b=\r\neing another variable, can be developed or undeveloped irrespective of the =\r\nother 34. Even illiterate Moodha, through surrender to their Guru, attain f=\r\nreedom from Ahamkara and so on...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BTW, Chitta is not the Condition=\r\ned Mind. Chitta does store the residual impressions of all the past incarna=\r\ntions. However, being constituted of Satwa Guna, it doesn&#39;t have any inhere=\r\nnt ability to act upon (Rajas) those impressions, just like a container con=\r\ntaining an inflammable liquid doesn&#39;t automatically burn it down. Sadhana i=\r\ns required for That.\n&gt; &gt; The Samskaras stored by Chitta, including those of=\r\n Nidra, Smriti, Vikalpa, Viparyaya, Pramana, correspond to the Tamo Guna, w=\r\nhile the Chitta itself is Satva Guna - hence the &quot;Satvic - Tamas&quot; represent=\r\ns the SuperEther tattwa (refer my previous mail). The all-perceiving Satvic=\r\n Chitta doesn&#39;t get conditioned by the Tamo-guni Samskaras it stores.\n&gt; &gt; O=\r\nnce the Chitta calms down, cleared of all residual impressions, only Satva =\r\nGuna remains, the intuition becomes coherent and the Soul reflects on itsel=\r\nf as distinct from Satva Guna of Prakriti (Chitta), thus realizing its own =\r\nnature as Brahman.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 5. \n&gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Sutras: \n&gt; &gt; drigadar=\r\nshanaktyore katmataivasmita -6\n&gt; &gt; Egoism is the identification of the seer=\r\n with the instrument of seeing. Patanjali has used Asmita instead of Ahamka=\r\nra.\n&gt; &gt; Since astral-bodied beings can use any of the senses like eyes to s=\r\nee, hear, smell, taste and so on (refer Autobiography of a Yogi)... the sen=\r\nse of egoism does not take roots in the astral-body and hence doesn&#39;t creat=\r\ne Astral Karma. Similarly, Causal bodied beings can use thought to sense ev=\r\nerything.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hence, Egotism has to be rooted out while the consciousn=\r\ness is associated with the Physical Body sensory activities or has Physical=\r\n Karma.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 6. The idea of Manas, as the controller of sense-conscious=\r\nness , must be overcome in Astral body, through Vairagya. Read autobiograph=\r\ny of a Yogi (chapter 43) where Sri Yukteswar illustrates that only those be=\r\nings who cannot be tempted to go back to the pleasing to the eye Astral cos=\r\nmos are permitted to stay permanently in the Causal cosmos. Pleasing to the=\r\n eye implies Sense-consciousness which is associated with Manas.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I=\r\nn Patanjali Yoga Sutras also it is mentioned in the same manner :\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\ndristanushravika vishaya vitrishnasya vashikara samjnavairagyam -15-\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; That effect which comes to these who have given up their thirst after ob=\r\njects, either seen or heard, and which wills to control the objects, is non=\r\n-attachment. Vivekananda has commented that Vairagya is the only way to fre=\r\nedom.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This is to be accomplished by transferring the consciousness=\r\n to Astral-Body and working out the Astral Karma or otherwise as an astral-=\r\nbodied being.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 7. Patanjali Yoga Sutras:\n&gt; &gt; yogashchittavrittin ir=\r\nodhah -2-\n&gt; &gt; Thus, extinguishing all the movements of Chitta is called &quot;Yo=\r\nga&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This is to be accomplished by transferring the consciousness=\r\n to Causal-Body and working out the Causal Karma or otherwise as a causal-b=\r\nodied being.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Nitish,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am afraid you are mixing up =\r\nterminologies. For example, ego or ahamkaara (sense of I-ness) is not limit=\r\ned to the physical body, but extends to subtle body and causal body as well=\r\n. In fact, ego resides in the causal body and affects other bodies.

My comments on that is:&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1. I-ness derived from Ahamkara,Manas and Chitta has no innate power t=\r\no Control any other idea of the 35 Causal-ideas.&lt;BR&gt;Reason:&lt;BR&gt;Soul is the =\r\nonly Truth and controller, everything else has an unreal and derived existe=\r\nnce. Thus, all the 35 ideas co-ordinate with each other, and not control ea=\r\nch other. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2. A new-born child or a person in Hypnotic-Trance, is ab=\r\nle to use his sense-consciousness coherently due to the astral-bodys&#39; sense=\r\n of I-ness derived from Manas, that coordinates the senses.&lt;BR&gt;He has no Bu=\r\nddhi or discriminating faculty to interact with manas (sensory-motor mind) =\r\nand tell it what to do - as you have proposed. Thus, Manas co-ordinates the=\r\n senses due to its own sense of I-ness, not due to Buddhi.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I hope th=\r\nis clarifies.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Regards,&lt;BR&gt;Nitish&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A\n href=3D&quot;http://in=\r\n.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;=\r\nvedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote=\r\n:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Out of the 19 or 35 attributes =\r\nof individualized consciousness, which one gives the idea &quot;I am this&quot; or &quot;I=\r\n am that&quot;? Of course, it is ahamkaraka or I-ness or egosense or ego princip=\r\nle!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Is one&#39;s idea of &quot;I am this&quot; limited to a physical bod=\r\ny? Of course not! If someone says &quot;so and so person is a terrible person&quot;, =\r\none may feel offended or if someone says &quot;so and so person is a great perso=\r\nn&quot;, one may feel elated. One&#39;s ahamkara or I-ness is identifying with the c=\r\nriticism or praise, even though nothing is being done to the physical body =\r\nand only a name is being used. When somebody calls one by name from distanc=\r\ne (as opposed to patting on the physical body and calling),\n one&#39;s consciou=\r\nsness may still think &quot;I am being called&quot; and one may turn towards the call=\r\ner. As in these examples, one&#39;s I-ness does of course bind itself to more t=\r\nhan a body.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Suppose one gets a dream while sleeping. One m=\r\nay have forgotten totally about the physical body in the dream! One may thi=\r\nnk of something else as &quot;I&quot;. In dreams, one may see oneself as a different =\r\nbody or may not even &quot;see&quot; onself, but still one may have the sense that so=\r\n and so thing is happening to &quot;me&quot;. So, even when the mind is drawn away fr=\r\nom the physical body, there is still a notion of &quot;I am this&quot; (I-ness) in a =\r\ndream. That is ahamkara or I-ness or ego principle.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Your i=\r\ndea that ahamkara is limited to physical body is absolutely unacceptable. A=\r\nhamkara or I-ness extends beyond the physical body.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Also, =\r\nyour idea that deities like Agni do not have ahamkara (I-ness) because they=\r\n do not have physical bodies is incorrect. Of course,\n Agni does have an I-=\r\nness and thinks &quot;I am Agni and this is what I do&quot;. If he did not have that =\r\nI-ness, he would not do everything he does.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Moreover, the =\r\n19 or 35 ideas of individualized consciousness do interact with each other,=\r\n whether we use the word &quot;control&quot; for some of those interactions or not. F=\r\nor example, buddhi (intellectual/ discriminating mind) judges various past =\r\nexperiences, interacts with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tells it what to=\r\n do. Then manas interacts with karmendriyas (organs of action) and makes th=\r\nem do various things. My buddhi determined what to write and my manas told =\r\nmy hands to type this and I ended up typing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Your point ab=\r\nout &quot;what exists as a part cannot be the whole&quot; is totally out of place. Th=\r\ne sense of I-ness, the memories and conditioning, the logical mind, the sen=\r\nsory-motor mind, karmendriyas etc are all different parts of individualized=\r\n consciousness and they play different roles\n while interacting with each o=\r\nther in different ways. Some of those interactions may be deemed to be cont=\r\nrols.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Am not mixing up the terminologies, though my m=\r\nail didn&#39;t&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; go in details.

Your understanding is flawed.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; 1. All ideas including the idea of Ahamkara naturally belong to the ide=\r\national or causal body, but Ahamkara must be overcome only in the physical =\r\nbody (See point 5.). Astral or Causal-bodied beings (those without a physic=\r\nal/astral body) don&#39;t have to fight with the idea of Ahamkara like we do.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego controls manas and buddhi also=\r\n. When manas (sensory-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ...they are all guided by the sens=\r\ne of I-ness. That sense of I-ness &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; permeates through all =\r\nlayers of one&#39;s individualized consciousness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 2=\r\n. Where did you read this up ?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; There is a fine l=\r\nine between the sense of I-ness attributed to the Individual Soul and the s=\r\nense of I-ness derived through the idea of Ahamkara. Even after a Soul is f=\r\nreed of the three bodies, the individuality of the Soul Atom is not destroy=\r\ned (Resurrection implies that), while it has already given up the idea of A=\r\nhamkara including all other ideas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Individuality=\r\n of a causal-bodied being is not due to the idea of Ahamkara because &quot;What =\r\nexists as a part cannot be the whole&quot;. Thus, the idea of Ahamkara, being on=\r\ne of the 35 ideas of the Causal-body, doesn&#39;t account for neither controls =\r\nthe rest of the 34 ideas. Each idea is independent of another, without requ=\r\niring another idea to act upon it - otherwise your buddhi would always inte=\r\nrfere with the functioning of Mind or Ahamkara or the 5 functions of life-f=\r\norces and so on.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n Essentially, the 35 ideas of c=\r\nausal body are the basic causal forces and are not related as cause-effect =\r\nto each other. Thus, each is independent of the application of the sense of=\r\n I-ness derived from Ahamkara. Manas and Buddhi being two of the Causal-ide=\r\nas, their functioning as well as existence is not &quot;controlled&quot; nor &quot;derived=\r\n&quot; in any way by the idea of Ahamkara. It is very clear when we see those wi=\r\nth sharpest Buddhi or Sharpest Mind still carrying Heaviest Ahamkara, becau=\r\nse they didn&#39;t work upon that particular idea.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; But ego/ahamkaara/ I-ness is the very basis of the entire=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; individualized consciousness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; 3. Well, as most Physical-bodied beings cannot see through the Astral/cau=\r\nsal cosmoses, it doesn&#39;t apply in the same way to the finer Astral and Caus=\r\nal-bodied beings who can always pierce the veil of Maya and see the human a=\r\nctivities. Thus, what is &quot;the very\n basis&quot; of the entire individualized con=\r\nsciousness for a physical-bodied (unenlightened) being is not the same as f=\r\nor an astral/causal bodied being.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; An Astral-bodied being think=\r\ns of Manas/sense- consciousness as the very basis of the entire individuali=\r\nzed consciousness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; A Causal-bodied being thinks of Chitta/perc=\r\neptive- consciousness as the very basis of the entire individualized consci=\r\nousness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; However, that individuality is of the Soul not derive=\r\nd from any idea, which is why it is not lost when the Astral being loses as=\r\ntral consciousness and reincarnates in the Physical body.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; As an example, Devatas, with their finer bodies, are able to work=\r\n through all the beings in all their physical-bodies simultaneously (like G=\r\nanesh resides in the Mooladhara, Agni digests the food, and so on..), never=\r\n getting controlled by Ahamkara that would require them to say that this pa=\r\nrticular body is &quot;my body&quot;\n or that one is mine - unless they incarnate in =\r\nPhysical bodies themselves. Devatas are, however, Astral/Causal- bodied bei=\r\nngs, so they would attempt to influence the Manas (Spirit-Possession) of th=\r\ne sense-bound worshipper. Pretas on the other hand, would attempt to posses=\r\ns ones&#39; physical body as well as act out their Ahamkara.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Out of the four antahkaranas, chitta (rememberi=\r\nng or conditioned &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) ar=\r\ne parts of the kaarana &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; sareera (causal body) and remain =\r\ntill the end.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 4. As per the resurrected Soul of =\r\nSri Yukteswar in Autobiography of a Yogi -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Causa=\r\nl body is a matrix of 35 ideas, that include 19 ideas comprising Astral bod=\r\ny (Chitta, Manas, Buddhi, Ahamkara, 5 functions of knowledge, 5 functions o=\r\nf Action, 5 functions of life-force) and 16 ideas comprising Physical body =\r\n(16 chemical\n elements).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Now, as we all know tha=\r\nt Physical body expires as a whole, not just one or two of the 16 elements =\r\ncomprising it go away at a time, Astral and Causal bodies are also cast off=\r\n as a whole in the corresponding cosmic consciousness - instead of differen=\r\nt constituent ideas slipping out of it at different times. Chitta being the=\r\n staging idea for all other modifications, can be termed as the last to go,=\r\n when the causal body is finally dropped - hence I wrote as rising above Ch=\r\nitta.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Thus, the idea of Ahamkara is bound with G=\r\nross Physical vibrations, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Manas with Subtle Astral vibrations=\r\n and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Chitta with infinitely Subtle Causal Vibrations.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Buddhi being another variable, can be developed or unde=\r\nveloped irrespective of the other 34. Even illiterate Moodha, through surre=\r\nnder to their Guru, attain freedom from Ahamkara and so on...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; BTW, Chitta is not the Conditioned Mind. Chitta does store t=\r\nhe residual impressions of all the past incarnations. However, being consti=\r\ntuted of Satwa Guna, it doesn&#39;t have any inherent ability to act upon (Raja=\r\ns) those impressions, just like a container containing an inflammable liqui=\r\nd doesn&#39;t automatically burn it down. Sadhana is required for That.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; The Samskaras stored by Chitta, including those of Nidra, Smriti, Vik=\r\nalpa, Viparyaya, Pramana, correspond to the Tamo Guna, while the Chitta its=\r\nelf is Satva Guna - hence the &quot;Satvic - Tamas&quot; represents the SuperEther ta=\r\nttwa (refer my previous mail). The all-perceiving Satvic Chitta doesn&#39;t get=\r\n conditioned by the Tamo-guni Samskaras it stores.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Once the Ch=\r\nitta calms down, cleared of all residual impressions, only Satva Guna remai=\r\nns, the intuition becomes coherent and the Soul reflects on itself as disti=\r\nnct from Satva Guna of Prakriti (Chitta), thus realizing its own\n nature as=\r\n Brahman.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 5. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Sut=\r\nras: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; drigadarshanaktyore katmataivasmita -6&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Egoi=\r\nsm is the identification of the seer with the instrument of seeing. Patanja=\r\nli has used Asmita instead of Ahamkara.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Since astral-bodied be=\r\nings can use any of the senses like eyes to see, hear, smell, taste and so =\r\non (refer Autobiography of a Yogi)... the sense of egoism does not take roo=\r\nts in the astral-body and hence doesn&#39;t create Astral Karma. Similarly, Cau=\r\nsal bodied beings can use thought to sense everything.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; Hence, Egotism has to be rooted out while the consciousness is assoc=\r\niated with the Physical Body sensory activities or has Physical Karma.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 6. The idea of Manas, as the controller of sense-con=\r\nsciousness , must be overcome in Astral body, through Vairagya. Read autobi=\r\nography of a Yogi (chapter 43) where Sri Yukteswar\n illustrates that only t=\r\nhose beings who cannot be tempted to go back to the pleasing to the eye Ast=\r\nral cosmos are permitted to stay permanently in the Causal cosmos. Pleasing=\r\n to the eye implies Sense-consciousness which is associated with Manas.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Sutras also it is mentioned in th=\r\ne same manner :&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; dristanushravika vishaya vitrish=\r\nnasya vashikara samjnavairagyam -15-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; That effect=\r\n which comes to these who have given up their thirst after objects, either =\r\nseen or heard, and which wills to control the objects, is non-attachment. V=\r\nivekananda has commented that Vairagya is the only way to freedom.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; This is to be accomplished by transferring the conscious=\r\nness to Astral-Body and working out the Astral Karma or otherwise as an ast=\r\nral-bodied being.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 7. Patanjali Yoga Sutras:&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; yogashchittavrittin irodhah\n -2-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Thus, extinguishing =\r\nall the movements of Chitta is called &quot;Yoga&quot;. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; T=\r\nhis is to be accomplished by transferring the consciousness to Causal-Body =\r\nand working out the Causal Karma or otherwise as a causal-bodied being.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; R=\r\negards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Nitish&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;ht=\r\ntp://in.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;=\r\n target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroup=\r\ns.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; w=\r\nrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Nitish,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I am afraid you are mixing up terminologies. For exampl=\r\ne, ego or ahamkaara (sense of I-ness) is not limited to the physical body, =\r\nbut extends to subtle body and causal body as well. In fact, ego resides in=\r\n the causal body and affects other\n bodies. Out of the four antahkaranas, c=\r\nhitta (remembering or conditioned mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are p=\r\narts of the kaarana sareera (causal body) and remain till the end.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego controls manas and buddhi also. =\r\nWhen manas (sensory-motor mind) observes sensory inputs or buddhi (intellec=\r\ntual or thinking mind) analyzes current and past observations of mind or ch=\r\nitta (remembering or conditioned mind) stores various observations or retri=\r\neves previously stored observations, they are all guided by the sense of I-=\r\nness. That sense of I-ness permeates through all layers of one&#39;s individual=\r\nized consciousness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Upanishads and var=\r\nious scriptures have broken down the individualized consciousness into vari=\r\nous groups by functionality, like five koshas, three sareeras, five praanas=\r\n, five jnaanendriyas, five karmendriyas, four antahkaranas, six/seven chakr=\r\nas etc. But ego/ahamkaara/\n I-ness is the very basis of the entire individu=\r\nalized consciousness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Though the word =\r\njnaana means different things to different people, a jnaana yogi pursues Se=\r\nlf by the path of contemplation and discrimination. When a jnaana yogi reac=\r\nhes the final target, all bodies and koshas are merged in cosmos.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedic=\r\nastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst ro=\r\nloger.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;=\r\nhttp://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality=\r\n: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank re=\r\nl=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/\n group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcas=\r\nt.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net=\r\n&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://w=\r\nww.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst=\r\n rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A h=\r\nref=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://=\r\nwww.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ----=\r\n yeeahoo_99 &lt;nitish.arya@ &gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; || OM TAT =\r\nSAT ||&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my =\r\nopinion, there are three distinct phases that lead the sould to rise above =\r\nEgo, Mind and Chitta - corresponding to the three bodies physical (Sthoola)=\r\n, astral (Sookshma) and causal (Karana)\n resp.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rising above Ego is Jnana - Merging Physical body in Phy=\r\nsical cosmos&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rising above Mind is Vairagya - Merging=\r\n Astral body in Astral cosmos&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rising above Chitta is=\r\n Yoga - Merging Causal body in Causal cosmos&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, becoming established in Para-Brahman is YogaArudh=\r\na.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your comments.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/=\r\ncompose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow=\r\n ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroup=\r\ns. com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

For example, body has a beginning and end and is perishable. So it is=\r\n not Self. One introspects like this and, though the process of elimination=\r\n, finally finds the true Self.
