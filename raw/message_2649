If the fact is that there is no I but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for Brahman, why a=\r\nll this Maya?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Let me ask a similar question:\n&gt;  \n&gt; If whatever happen=\r\ns in a dream is not really happening and just being imagined in your mind, =\r\nwhy all that imagination? Why not just be dreamless?\n\nWell, till the time, =\r\nI realize I can control my mind and hence control if or not I should get a =\r\nspecific dream, I can not help what kind of dream I get. Yes, dream is a ma=\r\nya, but I do not control it.\n\nHow ever, I presume that the All mighty, Omni=\r\npotent does know how to control maya. So, the God is playing the maya. His =\r\nmaya is intented and deliberate while my dreams are not deliberate.\n\nSo, co=\r\nmparing dreams to His maya may not be appropriate. This still leaves two qu=\r\nestions - Why is he playing this maya and how we can realise this is all ma=\r\nya.\n\nOn my part, I will try to purify my self and hopefully, I will realise=\r\n one day.\n\nBest regards,\nVijay\n\n\n"}}
