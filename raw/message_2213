I g=\r\nathered from our chat that it was something to do with black magic. \n\nWhen =\r\nI got home today, I asked my grandmother and she refused to tell me what it=\r\n was. I googled it and came across as it being a book of tantra dealing wit=\r\nh the darker aspects- potential to damage others. \n\nOn one of the books, th=\r\nere is a picture of Ma Kali. And one shop that sells it online mentions Das=\r\n MahaVidya.\n\nSo my question is, if all these mantras that exist that can ha=\r\nrm other people, who empowers these mantras? I really find it hard to belie=\r\nve that Ma will give power to people to harm others. \n\nI do know from Vedic=\r\n stories about devas granting boons to demons, for example- Hiranyakashipu&#39;=\r\ns story. But, considering we are in Kali Yuga, does this still happen? Peop=\r\nle are more likely to die from AIDS, cancer etc, so whats the big deal with=\r\n black magic? Is this just childish superstition or all part of a larger wo=\r\nrk of karma?\n\nSorry for the questions, its just been annoying me at the bac=\r\nk of my mind. \n\nJaya Sita Raama\nBivash \n\n\n\n\n"}}
