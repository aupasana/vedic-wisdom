Think of the skirt of severed arms with the hands still=\r\n attached which she sports.  Its high fashion in the Real World where our r=\r\nelative existence as jivas must meet the Ultimate Existence and fully recko=\r\nn with the ignorance that we have mistaken for knowledge.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Please f=\r\norgive me...i am still a saMsAri caught like a wild animal in the trap of d=\r\nualistic concepts. &quot; This is good, this is better....&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Warm Regar=\r\nds\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ajaya\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic=\r\nastrostudent&quot; &lt;vedicastrostudent@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimhaji and =\r\nothers,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I used to meditatively listen to/chant the Savitur Gay=\r\natri every morning, and on the weekends, I did a homam also (doing the Savi=\r\ntur Gayatri). Gayatri, especially in Homan seems to make things awaken in m=\r\ne, even with a tinge of sexual desire, yet still making me more spiritual. =\r\nSeparately, for the past few months, I have been having this heavy weight o=\r\nf a depressive feeling (due to several events/situations in my life) which =\r\njust hasnt left me, and even the Gayatri/Homam doesnt relieve except immedi=\r\nately after a Homam for less than a day. After some reading around and doin=\r\ng some astrology, I finally arrived at a Kali mantra - Om Kreem Kalikaye na=\r\nmah, and I have started meditating on that every morning, but I still do we=\r\nekend homams with Savitur Gayatri. But things have changed now. The Kali ma=\r\nntra is very punishing in a mental tightness kind of way, yet still helps m=\r\ne deal with mental hardship without completely giving up/getting angry/stre=\r\nssed. So I have continued it. Yet the day I do Savitur Gayatri homam, the G=\r\nayatri results seems a bit weaker - I have no idea why. Also, if I dont med=\r\nitate on the Kali mantra later on in the same day (i.e. if I try to drop a =\r\nday of doing Kali mantra), I get into conflicts much more easily. Is there =\r\nsome kind of conflict between the two? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sundeep\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
