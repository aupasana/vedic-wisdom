We are on the gro=\r\nund (or,\nperhaps underground). And our goal is to get onto the roof of one =\r\nof\nthese very tall buildings, which is above the clouds. How do you get\nto =\r\nthe top?\n\nThere are so many different tall buildings. Each of these is like=\r\n a\nreligion. You may be more familiar with some of them, and others might\nl=\r\nook frightening. Inside, there are so many different sets of\nelevators (pat=\r\nhs of sadhana). Some of the elevators will go slow, and\nsome will go fast. =\r\nSome will go all the way to the top, and some will\nonly go to specific floo=\r\nrs.\n\nOnce we are inside the elevator, we might enjoy so many sensations,\nli=\r\nke the acceleration and deceleration of the elevator. We might like\nit so m=\r\nuch that we forget about getting to the top, and simply go up\nand down the =\r\nelevator. The elevator may stop at so many floors. Each\nfloor is a tempatio=\r\nn. From the elevator, we may see many sights and\nhear many sounds. Again, w=\r\ne might forget about our goal and get off\nthe elevator.\n\nAt the beginning, =\r\nwe have to be careful. We should stay on the\nelevator all the way to the to=\r\np. Anything else takes us away from our\ngoal. But, at the end, we have to g=\r\net off the elevator. After all, the\ngoal is to get to the top of the buildi=\r\nng, and not to stay inside.\nPerhaps we have to take some stairs and open so=\r\nme doors to get out\nonto the roof.\n\nPerhaps you can think of each of these =\r\ntall building like a religion.\nYes, they may appear to be an obstacle (afte=\r\nr all, when you are inside\nthe building, and inside an elevator, the sky is=\r\n not at all visible).\nBut, the quickest and safest way to get to the roof i=\r\ns to go inside,\nand take an elevator to the top.\n\nSome people may advise a =\r\nmore direct path, always keeping the goal in\nsight. They may say that you s=\r\nhould directly climb the outside of the\nbuilding. They may be technically c=\r\norrect, but this path is not for\neveryone.\n\nFrom a practical point of view,=\r\n the answer is simple -- do sadhana and\nmore sadhana. Do it inside of your =\r\nreligious construct if it helps\nyou. Ignore the religious constructs when t=\r\nhey become an obstacle.\n\nThere are so many mails on this list. Every mail s=\r\nerves a purpose.\nBut, not all mails are applicable or useful to everyone. R=\r\nead and\nre-read the mails that are useful, and ignore the ones that aren&#39;t.=\r\n At\nthe end of the day, you will learn much more from sadhana than you\nwill=\r\n from the mails on this list.\n\nsasneham,\n\n   ajit\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Jul 23, 2012 =\r\nat 6:47 AM, sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Dear Rajarshij=\r\ni,\n&gt;\n&gt; The story is interesting......but forgive me, incomplete!

Lately I realized this is literally true. Heavy psychol=\r\nogical constructs are created by religions to protect an average person fro=\r\nm the real experience of God, which is so powerful and overwhelming that if=\r\n and when it happens, it can effectively cause a hurricane in your average =\r\nlife and pretty much destroy all your well laid plans.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I will brie=\r\nfly narrate a true and interesting incident.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; An individual - say X=\r\n - had gone to Vrindavan to stay there for some years. He was sitting at a =\r\nsatsang of a famous sadhu, enjoying the discourse, when a ragged looking ma=\r\nn, with piercing unblinking eyes, comes over and asks for food. The sadhu w=\r\nho was lecturing at the satsang, stopped and ordered someone to bring some =\r\nsweets for the ragged looking man. Then he did a pranam to the man and said=\r\n, &quot;Maharaj, please tell us some words of God&quot;. The man became angry, and re=\r\ntorted back, &quot;Why? Why waste time talking of God, no one wants God anyway. =\r\nIf God comes, all will run away. So please continue with your lectures as y=\r\nou were doing before I came in&quot;. Everyone became uncomfortably silent heari=\r\nng this. Meanwhile the sweets came, the man took a sweet into his mouth, lo=\r\noked up at the sky and then got up and started walking off. After he went o=\r\nut, the Sadhu who was lecturing, looked at his followers and said, &quot;He is a=\r\n sadhu who comes to Vrindavan once in a while,\n&gt;&gt;  but he has probably lost=\r\n his mental balance due to smoking too much ganja&quot;. Now X, who was sitting =\r\nthere, for some weird reason felt attracted to that ragged man and went out=\r\n to see where the guy was going. As he approached the ragged looking man, t=\r\nhe man turned around and spoke to X in clear English, &quot;Hello, I was waiting=\r\n for you to come and join me.&quot; X was of course taken aback, did not expect =\r\nthe man to speak in English and more over he had no clue how the man got to=\r\n know that he knew English (X was dressed in the garb of a sadhu - saffron =\r\nclothes).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The man continued, &quot;My name is Mr Iyengar. I was born ne=\r\nar Chennai, was an Engineer by profession, but left home long back and have=\r\n been a wondering sadhu since then.&quot; X asked him, why did you derive the sa=\r\ndhu who was doing the satsang? Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;All this is bogus. Actu=\r\nally this God thing itself is source of all confusion. No one has a clue. N=\r\not the hordes of Sadhus, not ordinary folks, really no one. And God is the =\r\nreason for all the religious troubles and other nonsense.&quot; X felt a little =\r\nirritated, &quot;Why do you have so much bitterness about religion/God/sadhus et=\r\nc? If you have been a sadhu for long, then how come you haven&#39;t met a singl=\r\ne genuine sadhu yet, how is it possible?&quot;. Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;Well if I t=\r\nake Vrindavan alone, there is only one genuine man here, rest are all as co=\r\nnfused as anybody else, merely different degrees of confusion. But you cann=\r\not meet that man, he is not accessible to others.&quot; Mr Iyengar continued, &quot;T=\r\nhe root of\n&gt;&gt;  all this problem is this God business. Know it for certain, =\r\nthat man cannot know God ever. What is infinite is beyond the capacity of t=\r\nhe human brain to comprehend. At best a man will only imagine a magnified m=\r\nan or a magnified woman with super-powers. If the individual keeps doing sa=\r\ndhana, one day he will create this form by a projection of his own mind, an=\r\nd he may even acquire supernatural abilities from this form, and generally =\r\nbe regarded by others as a man of god. But God is beyond this. That is why =\r\nI say the root of the problem is trying to understand the infinite with a f=\r\ninite mind and then stressing that one has understood correctly.&quot; While tal=\r\nking, the sadhu stopped at a small tea-stall and bought some ganja, and in =\r\none pull finished off the chillum. Then held the smoke in a kumbaka for abo=\r\nut 5 minutes, slowly releasing the smoke in small bits. Then he continued, =\r\n&quot;You (meaning X) are a young man. Have a clear mind in your head, don&#39;t get=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;  confused by all these show of spirituality you see in holy places. Whe=\r\nn I was your age, I did a lot of terrible mistakes in the impetuousness of =\r\nyouth. I was an infamous young man in the locality of Chennai where I grew =\r\nup. But then one day having nothing better to do, I left home. After roamin=\r\ng for 3 decades, I slowly realized what God really is and how to interact w=\r\nith this thing.&quot; As he spoke he reached a two storied house, and a man, wom=\r\nan and a young girl came out of the house. They invited him inside and Mr I=\r\nyengar inturn said to X, you too come inside, these people love me a lot so=\r\n when I come to Vrindavan I stay at their house. I will show you something =\r\ninteresting if you join me.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; After an hour inside the house, X was =\r\nfeeling very bored and irritated. The woman was bringing different fruits a=\r\nnd sweets for their food while the young girl was massaging Mr Iyengar&#39;s fe=\r\net as he lay down on a cot, enjoying the hospitality. X thought this man is=\r\n one more fraud, he abuses everyone else but has no qualms about shamelessl=\r\ny accepting the hospitality of a householder and enjoying a good life. As s=\r\noon as this thought crossed his mind, he saw that the man and the woman and=\r\n the girl=C2  stood up and with folded hands were bowing down towards the c=\r\not where Mr Iyengar was lying down. X was sitting on the floor, facing the =\r\nopp direction to the cot. He too turned round to see what was going on. Wha=\r\nt he saw made his jaw drop open in shock. Instead of the old, bald, ragged =\r\nbeggar that was Mr Iyengar, there sat on the cot a young man, who looked in=\r\n his early twenties, whose whole skin was dazzlingly fair, emanating a bril=\r\nliant glow that lightened up the\n&gt;&gt;  whole room. He had a shaved head, four=\r\n arms, holding lotus and weapons, with enchantingly beautiful eyes! It look=\r\ned not a human being any more but a god sitting in place of what was even f=\r\nive minutes back only a frail, dirty-looking Mr Iyengar.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; X did not=\r\n know what was happening. He saw the young man gestured towards him to stan=\r\nd up and come near the cot. Like being hypnotized, X got up and walked upto=\r\n the cot and the young man embraced him and X lost all consciousness. When =\r\nhe woke up, he saw he was near a temple, in a remote location with trees an=\r\nd shrubs all around. Old Mr Iyengar was nearby, held his hand and took him =\r\ninside the temple precincts. There he saw a dhuni burning, and next to it a=\r\nn old man, naked, sitting in meditation with ash all over his body. Mr Iyen=\r\ngar did not say a word, pointed out that meditating man to him and then too=\r\nk X out of the temple. That is the man I was talking about, he said. You sh=\r\nould meet him tomorrow. He is the only one in Vrindavan currently who has a=\r\nn idea what God really means. After providing directions of how to reach th=\r\nat desolate temple, Mr Iyengar hugged X again and immediately he felt he wa=\r\ns losing awareness of place/time and lapsed into\n&gt;&gt;  unconsciousness again.=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When X woke up, he was in the room in that house, lying on the fl=\r\noor. Mr Iyengar was on the bed, his old, ragged self, with a mischievous sm=\r\nile on his face. Next day, X went to the temple as directed.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; -Rega=\r\nrds\n&gt;&gt; =C2 Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =C2\n&gt;&gt; awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabud=\r\ndhayah |\n&gt;&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ____=\r\n____________________________\n&gt;&gt;  From: Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Monday, 23 July 2012 8:13 AM\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] To those who say that they don=E2=80=99t believ=\r\ne in any religion\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =C2\n&gt;&gt; Dear Prasanth,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; To those who say t=\r\nhat they don=E2=80=99t believe in any religion\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In general, m=\r\nany of those who don&#39;t believe in religion or God are being more honest tha=\r\nn those who do. After all, most people who believe in God look at him as a =\r\nlimited being to barter with. All of our biases and assumptions are most ap=\r\nparent when dealing with our Gods. Often, religion has simply served to for=\r\nmalize these biases.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; While being mired in this word of duality, we th=\r\nink that an ounce of insincere prayer can undo the whole weight of &quot;paapa&quot; =\r\nthat we engage in throughout the day. And we lay this bias on our God. No w=\r\nonder that others look at all the suffering in the world and laugh at this =\r\nconcept of God. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; We all have plent=\r\ny of paapa and punya in our karmic pipeline. Instead of asking for the stre=\r\nngth to be steadfast while we reap both kinds of fruits, we ask God to burn=\r\n &quot;paapa&quot; and leave the &quot;punya&quot; intact. It is us &quot;God believers&quot; who look at=\r\n our lives, ignoring all the &quot;paapa phala&quot;. We look at one or two instances=\r\n of &quot;punya phala&quot; and declare our prayers to be successful. However, an imp=\r\nartial observer sees it for what it is, and laughs at us. We &quot;God believers=\r\n&quot; are the culprit.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; For the most part, our bhakti is weak. When we are=\r\n engaged in spiritual practices, our bhakti is particularly weak, and we co=\r\nunt the seconds and minutes. When engaged in worldly pursuits, our bhakti i=\r\ns strong, and time really flies. And yet, we expect God to reward our weak =\r\nspiritual bhakti and ignore our strong worldly bhakti. An impartial observe=\r\nr sees it for what it is, and laughs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the culp=\r\nrit.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The best way to bring about new waves of bhakti is not to look a=\r\nt the &quot;non-believers&quot; and try to convert them. All we have to do is try to =\r\neliminate our lack of belief, and be honest with ourselves. If we can trans=\r\nform ourselves, the world will be served.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If we see God as the limitl=\r\ness power that he is, he is difficult to define. It is difficult to capture=\r\n him within a religion. Religion should see itself as a stepping-stone, and=\r\n should ask each of us to _eventually_ place our feet on top of it to reach=\r\n the higher goals. Unfortunately, most religions ask us to accept them with=\r\nout question. They ask us to place our heads on them with reverence, and tr=\r\ny to prevent the spiritually advanced from going any farther.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; sasneha=\r\nm,\n&gt;&gt; =C2\n&gt;&gt; =C2  =C2 ajit\n&gt;&gt; =C2\n&gt;&gt; =C2\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---------------------=\r\n---------------\n&gt;\n&gt; || Om Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih ||\n&gt; Yahoo!
