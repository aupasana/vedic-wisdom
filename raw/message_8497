One per=\r\nson whom i know quite well since childhood, has affinity to this Mahamantra=\r\n since his childhood, has learnt it from his Grandfather. Once He came from=\r\n office late in the night and his Mother told him that certain lady staying=\r\n in same apartment has been diagnosed with some cancer (don&#39;t remember exac=\r\nt nature). He and his mother felt deep sense of pain as well as compassion =\r\nfor the lady. they were of low means and family of 3 small children. The pe=\r\nrson felt strong inspiration to ask help from Lord Shiva by reciting Maha-M=\r\nrityunjaya Mantra. He took bath and sat for reciting the same for some time=\r\n. The sense of compassion and appeal with feeling of helplessness was quite=\r\n deep while he recited the Mantra. As per him, more than concentration on w=\r\nords of the Mantra, his focus was more on asking for help from Lord Shiva.\n=\r\n\nCall it a good luck or Shiva&#39;s Grace or Power of this Mantra or power of P=\r\nrayers from her family or all of that together, the Lady survived and they =\r\nare leading a happy family Life. Do not know exactly what the reasons are b=\r\nut This Mantra coupled with deep sense of concern at the time of recital ma=\r\ny work wonders! The person thanked Shiva in his heart of hearts.\n\nSalutatio=\r\nn to Lord Shiva! The Auspiciousness personified!\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; One person I know was=\r\n diagnosed with cancer and doctors gave him about \n&gt; 2-3 months, many years=\r\n back.\n&gt; \n&gt; He chanted Mrityunjaya mantra whenever he could, for the next f=\r\new \n&gt; months.\n&gt; \n&gt; He not only survived, but he totally reformed his lifest=\r\nyle. He started \n&gt; eating organic, learnt the basics of ayurveda and made s=\r\nure his diet was \n&gt; correct for his body type, stopped using a microwave, s=\r\ntopped eating \n&gt; processed food with unnecessary ingredients, and started e=\r\nating saattwik \n&gt; food, mostly prepared by himself.

The building was=\r\n new and he told me \n&gt; &gt; after he moved in with his family they had done bi=\r\ng haven of this \n&gt; &gt; mantra. During night before I went to sleep I was tryi=\r\nng to do=C2=A0a eye \n&gt; &gt; open meditation and was in a slight trance.Suddenl=\r\ny I noticed some \n&gt; &gt; spirits/entities were trying to come in the room thro=\r\nugh window but \n&gt; &gt; they could not come as there was a covering of white li=\r\nght there. I \n&gt; &gt; knew immediately it is the effect of that haven in the ho=\r\nuse.

It is also strange how a dead body looks just like an empty \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; house...exactly like someone just left. It certainly makes one think \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; that there must be something more to us than this fleshy cage. This \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n cage that becomes unattractive in old age, filled with appalling \n&gt; &gt; mise=\r\nries in serious illness, and hideous in death.\n&gt; &gt; It is interesting to thi=\r\nnk about what one can do to help the sick and \n&gt; &gt; dying, when they reach a=\r\n stage beyond all human aid. It is not \n&gt; &gt; pleasant to watch someone die w=\r\nhile feeling utterly helpless to \n&gt; &gt; relieve suffering.\n&gt; &gt; Sivananda used=\r\n to have great faith in the Name- he used to call it \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Divine Namapathy=\r\n&quot;. While modern medicine, Ayurveda, Reiki etc all \n&gt; &gt; have their place, he=\r\n used to say that, Namapathy was an outstanding \n&gt; &gt; way to prevent disease=\r\n and heal us on all levels- physical, mental and \n&gt; &gt; spiritual.\n&gt; &gt; While =\r\nhe said all names of God- Rama, Allah, Buddha, Jehovah- are \n&gt; &gt; equal, he =\r\noften mentioned the Mahamrityunjaya mantra specially for \n&gt; &gt; healing purpo=\r\nses. And especially for those who are very sick or dying.\n&gt; &gt; He says &quot;Maha=\r\n Mrityunjaya Mantra will remove accidents, incurable \n&gt; &gt; diseases and best=\r\now long life and immortality. It is a Moksha Mantra \n&gt; &gt; too.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; I visite=\r\nd the Sivananda Charitable hospital in Pattamadai, Tamil Nadu \n&gt; &gt; some yea=\r\nrs ago, and the doctors and nurses who work there, start the \n&gt; &gt; day with =\r\nchanting of mantras (including the Mahamrityunjaya) for their \n&gt; &gt; patients=\r\n, each other and the whole world. I believe it is the same \n&gt; &gt; with the li=\r\nttle Ashram hospital in Rishikesh. What a wonderful way to \n&gt; &gt; start the d=\r\nay.....repeating mantras with your colleagues.\n&gt; &gt; I wanted to mention the =\r\npower of this mantra for anyone who knows \n&gt; &gt; people who are sick/seriousl=\r\ny ill (or indeed, if you yourself are \n&gt; &gt; unfortunately unwell). It is sim=\r\nply to invoke the blessing of God to \n&gt; &gt; ease suffering, or to help bear s=\r\nuffering better. Basically saying \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Thy Will be done&quot; because You know =\r\nwhat is best. Of course it is NOT \n&gt; &gt; asking for a miracle cure (unless th=\r\nat happens to be the Will of God).\n&gt; &gt; At any point in time, there are seve=\r\nral human beings, animals and \n&gt; &gt; various creatures who are dying, and unf=\r\nortunately suffering greatly \n&gt; &gt; during the process of dying. I think it w=\r\nould be nice to repeat this \n&gt; &gt; mantra a few times daily to reduce their m=\r\nisery. Our sages say it \n&gt; &gt; works, and I believe them.\n&gt; &gt; Here is a link =\r\nfor those who are interested in learning more about \n&gt; &gt; this great mantra.=\r\n The article is written by a disciple of Swami \n&gt; &gt; Satyananda, a saint of =\r\nvery recent times.\n&gt; &gt; http://www.yogamag.net/archives/2007/ajan07/mrit.sht=\r\nml \n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://www.yogamag.net/archives/2007/ajan07/mrit.shtml&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best w=\r\nishes,\n&gt; &gt; Aparna\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------=\r\n------------------\n&gt; &gt; || Om Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih || Yahoo!
