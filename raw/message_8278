True, atma cannot be poluted and is beyond desires and=\r\n actions. But most people do not identify with atma. They identify with a p=\r\nerishable body. So all the talk of &quot;all is atma and atma is pure&quot; is just t=\r\nheory.\n=A0\nAtma is like an ocean in which waves and rippes arise and move. =\r\nOcean does not get shattered when ripples hit each other and stays the same=\r\n. But bodies, minds and other perishable objects arising in atma are like w=\r\naves and ripples arising and moving in ocean. They increase, decrease, get =\r\nshattered etc. One identifying with the ocean of atma is beyond happiness a=\r\nnd sadness. One identifying with the ripple of a body will experience happi=\r\nness, sadness etc.\n=A0\nSuppose one is watching a movie and knows that it is=\r\n not real and just a movie. Still, when a really scary scene comes, one may=\r\n be startled. Mere intellectual understanding that it is not real and just =\r\na movie, is not enough. It has to be ingrained fully in one&#39;s instincts. Si=\r\nmilarly, intellectually knowing that all this is a play and not real, is no=\r\nt enough. When some really pleasurable and painful event happens, one WILL =\r\nidentify with the body and experience something.\n=A0\nIf Shankara was fully =\r\nenlightened before that episode (we don&#39;t know that for sure), then the act=\r\nion would not have bound him. Otherwise, it would&#39;ve created a rina. If he =\r\nexperienced some pleasure, he would create a new rina to the queen, to vari=\r\nous deities (!) who live within one&#39;s consciousness and operate various par=\r\nts of one&#39;s body and mind, and to various beings in his virya who may have =\r\nbeen significantly affected. He would have to pay those debts back later.\n=\r\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nThere is nothing ab=\r\nsolutely sacred or dirty about any action. It is the intent and attitude of=\r\n the actor that makes an action sacred or dirty. Self-centered actions are =\r\nmore dirty than selfless actions geared at others. More so, the denser and =\r\nmore selfish one&#39;s conditioning. \n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\n&gt; but knowing this still he performed his rituals for his m=\r\nother?did he do\n&gt; this for love or respect or pity or just to balance his r=\r\nuna?\n=A0\nOnly still ocean does not have any ripples or their movement. Simi=\r\nlarly only ummanifest atma (Self after dissolution/pralaya and before new s=\r\nrishti/creation) does not have any objects and actions within it. Atma duri=\r\nng a srishti cycle does have many objects within it and many actions betwee=\r\nn them.\n=A0\nThus, realizing Self does NOT mean sitting still in a forest an=\r\nd doing nothing. Various bodies keep doing various actions. A realized pers=\r\non identifies with atma and actions by various people seem to him/her like =\r\nhis/her actions. One does not particularly identify with what one&#39;s old bod=\r\ny specifically does (based on previous momentum).\n=A0\nNature uses such real=\r\nized people to set good examples for the world. So they do engage in some a=\r\nctions. They have no pride or shame, no happiness or sadness and do whateve=\r\nr spontaneously occurs to them.\n=A0\nShankara performing last rites for moth=\r\ner would&#39;ve made Mother happy. Moreover, it would set an example for future=\r\n. One&#39;s interaction with the world is give & take. We give things to others=\r\n and take things from them. True renunciation is in renouncing what we take=\r\n. There is no need to renounce giving. As the prevant notion of sannyasa wa=\r\ns to cut off from the world, Shankara demonstrated giving others (e.g. moth=\r\ner) sannyasa.\n=A0\nSwami Vivekananda and Swami Sivananda took this further. =\r\nThey engaged in a lot of service for the society, unlike other sannyasis wh=\r\no lock themselves in isolation.\n=A0\nOf course, if the act of &quot;giving&quot; incre=\r\nases pride (i.e. you are &quot;taking&quot; something in return of what you are givin=\r\ng!!!), then a sannyasi better isolate oneself from the world and neither gi=\r\nve nor take (except absolute essentials for survival). But, when one progre=\r\nsses beyond some level, it is a good idea to &quot;give&quot; what one is in a positi=\r\non to give others.\n=A0\nThe purpose of life is to give and not to take, thou=\r\ngh some taking is unavoidable in the process of giving.
