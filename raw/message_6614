I am thinking now it is too b=\r\nig if I want to start daily homams. The small copper ones I have seen at th=\r\ne shop do not have stands and they are like 2x2 inch interior or max of 3x3=\r\ninches. What is the ideal size for a daily homam kumd? If I cannot use bric=\r\nks, can I just place the copper kund on a wooden plank or newspaper piece !=\r\n \n&gt; Also, do we need to wash and clean the homa kund, the wooden ladle and =\r\nthe whole prayer area daily ? \n&gt; \n&gt; regards\n&gt; rAma\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Rama V&quot; &lt;vsra_prasad@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Sh Narasim=\r\nha, et al. - I have done my first homam (SriKrsna homam) today, hopefully i=\r\nt was fine, as I made some minor mistakes. \n&gt; &gt; First of all, the fire got =\r\nput off twice, as the twigs did not catch fire easily. I learnt that the tw=\r\nigs need to be cut vertically for them to burn better.\n&gt; &gt; Secondly, the fu=\r\nll dry coconut did not burn completely in the poornahuti and if I put a hal=\r\nf one or a piece it would have burnt completely.\n&gt; &gt; Also, the dharbhas I h=\r\nave were a bit bent and I could not put them pointed to north or south or t=\r\nhe other directions correctly. Hope that was ok too !\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now some que=\r\nstions (I am sure these have been answered, I apologize, but would apprecia=\r\nte if you respond again); btw, if these could be put in FAQ, will be much o=\r\nbliged.\n&gt; &gt; 1. what do I do with the partially burnt poornahuti ? Can I use=\r\n it tomorrow ? Also, what does one do with all the ash and the burnt part? =\r\nWhat is the holy way to dispose it off ? No lakes or river by in Bangalore =\r\n! Do I put them under a tree and pour water ? Not many trees, only plants, =\r\nin the apts I live here.\n&gt; &gt; 2. If there are any unburnt part of the twigs,=\r\n can I use them again? Or do they need to be disposed off ?\n&gt; &gt; 3. Is it ad=\r\nvisable to dip (not pour) the twigs in the ghee so that they burn well ?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Let me know of other points I might have known for a beginner.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Finally, a million thanks and appreciations for all who are responsible=\r\n (Sh MMP, Sh PVR, etc.) for the KT.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; regards\n&gt; &gt; rAma\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
