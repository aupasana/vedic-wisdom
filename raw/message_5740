Thus, we are=\r\n all in so many ways unequal in our appearance, our abilities, our preferen=\r\nces, and our desires.\n\nRather than attempting to lie to ourselves and artif=\r\nicially fly in the face of clearly discernible empirical facts, Sanatana Dh=\r\narma encourages all human beings to respect each other, honor our differenc=\r\nes, and work together in compassion, dignity and harmony, despite our unden=\r\niable recognition of all our many differences. Sanatana Dharma (the Eternal=\r\n Natural Way), thus gives us the empowerment to live in accordance with the=\r\n natural order of the universe in a manner that is beneficial to all.\n\nFor =\r\nDharma, the realm of true equality lies not on the physical, mental, intell=\r\nectual, or egoic planes, but in the realm of spirit. Having God as our sole=\r\n source, sustainer, and ultimate destiny, we all share in the same spiritua=\r\nl parent.
