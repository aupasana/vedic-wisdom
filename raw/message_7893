However, I missed the Amavasya day.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. As per the manual, this t=\r\narpana can be performed on any day, any \n&gt; week, any fortnight, and every m=\r\nonth but there are some special days as \n&gt; well. Is it fine to start from t=\r\nhe coming Saturday/Sunday and then \n&gt; perform it every fortnight?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. I=\r\nn the manual, after the Rishi tarpana section, one moves to Divya \n&gt; Manush=\r\nya tarpana. Here, one is supposed to use the same water pot \n&gt; containing t=\r\nhe akshatas as in the earlier Rishi tarpana section?\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. After the Divy=\r\na Manushya tarpana, one moves to the Divya Pitri and \n&gt; Pitri sections. Her=\r\ne, one is supposed to put some black sesame seeds to \n&gt; the water in the po=\r\nt. Does this mean that one adds the black sesame \n&gt; seeds to the water alre=\r\nady containing the akshatas in the water pot? So, \n&gt; one gives tarpana to D=\r\nivya Pitris and Pitris with water containing \n&gt; akshatas and sesame seeds o=\r\nr water containing only sesame seeds?\n&gt; \n&gt; I eagerly await your replies to =\r\nthe above questions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks and best regards,\n&gt; Manish\n&gt; \n&gt;   &lt;http://=\r\ndocs.yahoo.com/info/terms/&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
