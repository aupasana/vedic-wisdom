Whether it is Krishna or Chandi, they may test by pushing the person to an extreme, but they never push beyond the breaking limit.\n \nWhen the mind identifies with something, that thing may be negatively affected by god to let one realize that that thing is transient and does not matter. As one realizes it a little, it may be more negatively affected. Finally, one may be pushed to an extreme.\n \nHowever, god is kind (even an ugra devata). God never pushes one to the breaking limit. God may push one short of the breaking limit. The breaking limit may change and then god may push further.\n \nTo use the analogy from the other mail of today, god the teacher does not test the 5th grade student with 6th grade questions. Of course, a 5th grade student passing from 5th grade to the 6th grade will now be tested with 6th grade questions. As one advances from one grade to another, one is tested more and more.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- shashi_nambisan &lt;shashin@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste All,\n&gt;     This depends on the selection of diety.
