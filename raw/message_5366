On the other side the Vegetarians can get that from \n&gt; Yog=\r\nhurt, Cheese and such foods. And such many points can be discussed from bot=\r\nh \n&gt; the sides.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) Few of the Arguments of Vegetarians and vegans is t=\r\nhat of &quot;Formation of \n&gt; Teeth&quot;, &quot;Formation of Intestines&quot; etc=E2=80=A6 They=\r\n say that Human teeth formation and \n&gt; digestive systems are not suitable f=\r\nor diet from the source of Animals. They \n&gt; site the examples of a Hoarse, =\r\ncow, Elephant, Goat, buffalo and compare that \n&gt; with Humans. Which I found=\r\n not proved when I see people around me. Majority of \n&gt; the population toda=\r\ny and earlier are meat eaters and there does not seem any \n&gt; noticeable phy=\r\nsical difference which suggest any difficulties for them. It is \n&gt; also not=\r\niced that because of High protein contents, they are well built. Same \n&gt; wa=\r\ny Physical strength, stamina, recovery from Illness and such were never iss=\r\nues \n&gt; with generations of people in India and else where who never used me=\r\nat and sea \n&gt; food in their diet.\n&gt; \n&gt; So science will not be able to give =\r\ndefinitive answer for some one to decide \n&gt; between 2 strict options, unles=\r\ns science proves without a doubt, that a certain \n&gt; disease or a Physical a=\r\nilment or a mental abnormality is only because of *eating \n&gt; meat* or *NOT =\r\neating meat* and that should also clearly visible in practical \n&gt; cases whi=\r\nch affect large section of masses. Till that time, so called science, \n&gt; wi=\r\nll mainly be used as a tool to debate on this issue of vegetarianism and \n&gt;=\r\n Non-vegetarianism because we do see that Diabetic ailment, Cardiac patient=\r\ns, \n&gt; Blood pressure problems and such many commonly seen diseases are foun=\r\nd in all \n&gt; sections of society irrespective of meat eaters or vegetarians.=\r\n Both sections \n&gt; are living their lives for Generations and generations.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Regarding Holistic approach, ethics, Low of Karma etc=E2=80=A6\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) =\r\nOne of My very close doctor friend who is a pediatric surgeon (M.Ch. in \n&gt; =\r\nPediatrics) and a strict vegetarian who also obviously contains a vast know=\r\nledge \n&gt; of medical science gave me a certain interesting fact. During his =\r\nstudies, their \n&gt; batch was once taken to a place called Deonar in Mumbai, =\r\n(where there is one of \n&gt; the biggest Slaughter houses of India. Daily arou=\r\nnd 4000 various animals are \n&gt; slaughtered to meet the need of Maharashtra =\r\nand to some extent India and 60% is \n&gt; exported mainly to Arab countries). =\r\n4 or 5 females from their batch could not \n&gt; stand the process of slaughter=\r\ning and they fell unconscious. Almost everybody \n&gt; including himself was sh=\r\nocked and disgusted to see the slaughterhouse and left \n&gt; the place with he=\r\navy hearts.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) There are meat eaters who are well advanced in spiritua=\r\nl path and there are \n&gt; vegetarians who are utterly selfish and deep down i=\r\nn materialism hence I refrain \n&gt; to talk on that line. Only I wish to say o=\r\nne thing that ethics, spirituality and \n&gt; such terms should not be used sel=\r\nectively as per our own conveniences. Something \n&gt; which is unethical will =\r\nremain unethical. To me, Killing animals, while better \n&gt; alternate sources=\r\n are available, to satiate hunger and far worst, to tickle the \n&gt; palate, i=\r\ns Unethical and simply unethical, be it or Earth or on Mars, be it \n&gt; Kaliy=\r\nuga or Satyuga.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) Solution is not to look if a Famous Saint or Philos=\r\nopher or any body, famous \n&gt; or otherwise, approves meat eating or disprove=\r\ns it or suggests middle approach, \n&gt; it does not make any difference. If Vi=\r\nmalananda emphatically suggest not to eat \n&gt; meat or otherwise (Vimalananda=\r\n was very clear for meat eating though), does not \n&gt; make any difference. L=\r\naw of Karma might be infinitely complex and might need \n&gt; deepest of unders=\r\ntanding but that does not suggest any thing. Who knows if next \n&gt; birth is =\r\nthere or not? However what really suggestive and decisively suggestive \n&gt; s=\r\nhould be our own Instincts, our own thinking, our own rationale, our own he=\r\nart. \n&gt; Why depend upon any body coming and telling us about if we should e=\r\nat meat or \n&gt; should not. Why not follow our own conscious and rationale. I=\r\n do not know if I \n&gt; kill a Goat and eat meat of the same, in the next life=\r\n or lives, I will be \n&gt; killed by the same Goat and I have to go through th=\r\ne same pain. Hardly anybody \n&gt; knows that but when it comes to the present,=\r\n I know for sure that the meat I am \n&gt; eating has been of an animal that ha=\r\ns been butchered mercilessly. That much is \n&gt; known without a doubt and tha=\r\nt should make me think. If *avoidable*, I must not \n&gt; eat that. It is that =\r\nsimple. Do not need further approval of anybody and no \n&gt; amount of argumen=\r\nts from Science or culture or religions or whatever should \n&gt; stand for me.=\r\n Do I need to even look at those? NO.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; \n&gt; --=\r\n- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Atul Ji and List members,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;I am not advocating Non-v=\r\neg food.

We &gt;should \n&gt; &gt;understand that we may be right but we should realize tha=\r\nt &gt;it does not \n&gt; &gt;&gt;necessarily mean other person is not right.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My=\r\n views are there on this subject in archives. I wanted to stay away but sti=\r\nll \n&gt; &gt;inspired to write at least one message on the same.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) Usin=\r\ng Arguments based on science, BV, so many of researches and plenty of \n&gt; &gt;i=\r\nnformations available on the Internet, One will never be able to come to a =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;definitive conclusions.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) I never argue with people (even whe=\r\nn I was aggressive and passionate about \n&gt; &gt;the Idea of vegetarian food) wi=\r\nth the above basis.\n&gt; &gt; Whatever said and done, people will continue eating=\r\n meat, eggs, Fish, Other \n&gt; &gt;seafood and probably Human flash as well. I ha=\r\nve, with experience, understood \n&gt; &gt;that there is no point in arguing with =\r\npeople giving various Data. Each side \n&gt; &gt;will have their own arguments, ow=\r\nn sets of Data and own Counter Ideas to prove \n&gt; &gt;their point.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3) =\r\nInstead I appeal their conscious! I tell people around me, whenever the \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;Topic comes up, only one simple thing - &quot;I dont want to kill for filling u=\r\np my \n&gt; &gt;Stomach&quot; and I say it from my heart. I tell people that Put a knif=\r\ne edge on your \n&gt; &gt;own Throat or Cut a finger only a little, feel the pain =\r\nand now realize the \n&gt; &gt;Plight of a butchered Chicken or a Goat or a cow or=\r\n a buffalo or a...., \n&gt; &gt;Suffocate yourself by closing Nose & Mouth and see=\r\n after only a few seconds, how \n&gt; &gt;you pent for the Air and Now realize the=\r\n &quot;Chhatpataahat&quot; of a fish forced out of \n&gt; &gt;water.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And all these,=\r\n because one wish to fill the stomach or satisfy cravings of a \n&gt; &gt;habitual=\r\n palate or both. Even vegetarians have their cravings of spice and other \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;food stuff but the very vital difference is that such craving does not ne=\r\ned \n&gt; &gt;killing!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4) Just to give a result, One of colleagues, who i=\r\ns a Srilankan, has left \n&gt; &gt;eating meat since 6 Months now and surely, one =\r\nof the reasons for his leaving \n&gt; &gt;meat is because I told my views him a fe=\r\nw times when such discussions came up \n&gt; &gt;and I even told him that you are =\r\na Buddhist, the religion of Non-Injury and see \n&gt; &gt;what has happened to tha=\r\nt very Idea. Hats-off to him for he really seems to have \n&gt; &gt;thought about =\r\nit and dared to change his swabhava which is so very difficult.\n&gt; &gt; Just to=\r\n clarify, I do not hesitate to express my views even to Muslims and \n&gt; &gt;oth=\r\ners and at least, this idea is appreciated by them even if grudgingly. The =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;Hard core meat eaters are also taken a back with this idea. All though =\r\nthey know \n&gt; &gt;from their hearts of hearts, it comes as a shock even to them=\r\n when somebody \n&gt; &gt;boldly brings that up. Most of us are like a cat that dr=\r\ninks the milk with \n&gt; &gt;closed eyes. The Idea would have gone in their mind =\r\nand that is enough. One day \n&gt; &gt;probably it will germinate.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 5) Fin=\r\nally, The point is not to say that this side is good and that side is \n&gt; &gt;b=\r\nad. It&#39;ll be a foolish and unpalatable conclusion. It is to just appeal the=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;inside human of each individual, It is to appeal the rational Intellig=\r\nence of an \n&gt; &gt;Individual, It is to appeal the heart of a person and if tha=\r\nt is not suffice to \n&gt; &gt;our ultra-hardened heart then a final reminder of &quot;=\r\nLaw of Cause and effect -The \n&gt; &gt;Law of Karma&quot; at least to those of us who =\r\nbelieve in Natures unfailing \n&gt; &gt;governance. And that is the final Idea.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, &quot;Dr. A.

Please point out my mistakes I will make in this \n&gt; &gt;process.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; We are trying to discuss three points here\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Choosing=\r\n a dietary habit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Dependence of Human population on Non-veg sources=\r\n of nutrition\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) bioavailability or BV of Non veg vs Veg food.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I commented on two points \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Choosing a dietary habit =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Dependence of Human population on non veg sources of nutrition\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Choosing a Dietary habit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One should choose his d=\r\nietary habit based on his varna (aptitude and \n&gt; &gt;attitude) and goal in his=\r\n life. He should not bother what the BV or other factor \n&gt; &gt;or research say=\r\ns. For an athlete, Eggs are important part of his training. and \n&gt; &gt;for a p=\r\nerson seeking spirituality one should stick to vegetarian food unless he \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;is able to rise above the difference in veg and nonveg. I agree with Nara=\r\nsimha \n&gt; &gt;Ji about this point.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In some diseases Non veg source=\r\ns play an very important role (Although not a \n&gt; &gt;necessasity) like in Albu=\r\nmin deficiency two eggs per day can save a person from \n&gt; &gt;costly (3000Rs p=\r\ner Inj) Albumin Injections. In TB, Soup made of goat meat do \n&gt; &gt;wonders. A=\r\nyurveda also recommend it strongly Charak Samhita) etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Dep=\r\nendence of Human population on non veg sources of nutrition\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I =\r\nagree with the link provided in this discussions. Books and articles by \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;Peta members are far more convincing for switching to Veg sources. I can a=\r\nlso \n&gt; &gt;provide tens of links and book reference which oppose their view. H=\r\nonestly, I do \n&gt; &gt;not believe each and every information on net and not eve=\r\nry book written about \n&gt; &gt;nutirtion, just like astrology. Let us leave this=\r\n debate aside and look at other \n&gt; &gt;aspect of it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; By &#39;Practica=\r\nlly impossible&#39; I meant the cost factor and demand/supply factor. \n&gt; &gt;In In=\r\ndia (Leave other high Nonveg consuming countries alone) about 45% people \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;are Non vegetarian and about 40% demand of Proteins are supplied by Non v=\r\neg \n&gt; &gt;sources. Currently, Important veg sourcesof proteins are Legumes (in=\r\ncluding gram \n&gt; &gt;soyabean, pulses etc. Costs about Rs 80 -120 Rs per Kg), N=\r\nuts (include almonds \n&gt; &gt;cashew etc - Costs needn&#39;t mention), Dairy product=\r\ns (Milk being 30-40 Rs per \n&gt; &gt;Kg), Grains (cheapest sources but not a very=\r\n complete source), \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In last two years, their demand rose b=\r\ny 15-20 % but their price rose by \n&gt; &gt;40-60%. even at current price, 60 % o=\r\nf population can not afford a complete \n&gt; &gt;balanced diet as recommended by =\r\nExperts which include 250 Ml of milk, 50-70 gms \n&gt; &gt;of legumes, 10 gms of v=\r\negetables, 150 gms of fruits per person, along with \n&gt; &gt;grains and roughage=\r\n etc (These are approx minimum quantities. Different sources \n&gt; &gt;may quote =\r\ndifferent quantities). There is average family size of 5 and average \n&gt; &gt;fa=\r\nmily income is 200 Rs per day! And nutrition is not the only thing needed i=\r\nn \n&gt; &gt;our life!!! Lot of other expenditures are there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Even at =\r\ncurrent prices, 60% population can not afford balanced diet. If \n&gt; &gt;additio=\r\nnal 40% is included in demand of veg sources, price may rise another 100% \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;and I need not to explain what will happen at that time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Si=\r\nr, I am not advocating Non-veg food here. I am also a strict vegetarian, \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;even for milk I prefer a source where there is minimum cruelity (Yes you =\r\ncan not \n&gt; &gt;expect no cruelity even for milk if you buy it from market and =\r\ndo not produce it \n&gt; &gt;yourself)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Again, I think and believe tha=\r\nt practically it is impossible to shift all the \n&gt; &gt;population to veg sourc=\r\nes especially when the agriculture land is decreasing day \n&gt; &gt;by day becaus=\r\ne of many reasons)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) Bioavailability or BV of different sourc=\r\nes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is always a questionable point. because again sections s=\r\nupporting \n&gt; &gt;vegetarian diet will highlight the results which support veg =\r\nfood and vice \n&gt; &gt;versa. There are lot of halfbaked researches. but if we t=\r\nhink scientifically we \n&gt; &gt;will find that for different sources different s=\r\nources are better. For example \n&gt; &gt;calcium animal sources are best (Includi=\r\nng milk), for albumin Egg is best, for \n&gt; &gt;Vit C veg sources are best, for =\r\nproteins animal sources are best (Ayurveda also \n&gt; &gt;support this) So I thin=\r\nk we can not say that only veg or non veg will suffice \n&gt; &gt;the diet. Obviou=\r\nsly humans can not survive on Nonveg food alone. As far as BV is \n&gt; &gt;concer=\r\nned I agree with the values given by Rajarshi ji.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I agree=\r\n Non veg food increases tamas in mind. But so does the deep fried \n&gt; &gt;veget=\r\narian food, although less but in daily habit it will not let you escape \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;from Tamas. I agree with Narasimha Ji that if more energy is used in diges=\r\nting \n&gt; &gt;food, less energy is available for brain. it is a scietific fact t=\r\nhat after \n&gt; &gt;food, significant blood supply is directed to intestines. How=\r\n much Rajas Spicy \n&gt; &gt;food, tea, coffee, coke and Red bull is increasing in=\r\n us? We are what we eat! \n&gt; &gt;This is true. So one should eat what one want =\r\nto become.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But still at last, I want to mention that I am not =\r\nadvocating Non-veg food. I \n&gt; &gt;am just highlighting the facts. I am a stric=\r\nt vegetarian too. We should \n&gt; &gt;understand that we may be right but we shou=\r\nld realise that it does not \n&gt; &gt;necessarily mean other person is not right.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Please point out my mistakes I had made in this post. I agree=\r\n that some \n&gt; &gt;values i mentioned here may not be exactly as quoted by sour=\r\nces. But they are \n&gt; &gt;approximate and not too much off the line.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Kind Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Atul\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I disgree with two p=\r\noints you mentioned.

They conducted an experiment on gorillas. One se=\r\nt of gorillas \n&gt; &gt;was \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fed with meat. The other set was fed wit=\r\nh nuts, fruits etc. After several \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; months, researchers found a gap =\r\nin the intelligence of the two sets. The \n&gt; &gt;ones \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fed with mea=\r\nt were duller.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If=C3=82=C2=A0you have any references for t=\r\nhis, in terms of whether they published \n&gt; &gt;any \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; paper on the s=\r\name, I am interested to know and analyse that in details. I \n&gt; &gt;am \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; open to learning and reviewing my position, provided there is genuine =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;evidence.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Their theory was that digestion =\r\nof meat takes up more energy.

In my other mail, I \n&gt; &gt;h=\r\nave \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; qoted from a couple of research papers and books on clinic=\r\nal nutrition and \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dietetics, and if you ask, I can provide more;=\r\n which may=C3=82=C2=A0take a few days \n&gt; &gt;since I \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have to get =\r\nthem from people who deal with these topics professionally, but \n&gt; &gt;time \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is not a problem.=C3=82=C2=A0All the papers are=C3=82=C2=A0from =\r\nthe most accepted and reputed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scientific=C3=82=C2=A0journals.

Otherwise, feed the poor \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fellow =\r\nwhatever he/she needs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An animal has a specifi=\r\nc physical=C3=82=C2=A0structure and needs to maintain the \n&gt; &gt;same. But \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if trained they can &#39;adjust&#39; to any kind of meals. I have seen pe=\r\nople \n&gt; &gt;feeding \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vegeterian diets to dogs. Statistically speak=\r\ning, an animal whose whole \n&gt; &gt;body \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; structure is designed to b=\r\ne a carnivore, may adjust to any food for the \n&gt; &gt;sake of \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surv=\r\nival, but will become internally weak and susceptable to disease and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; weaknesses. Who takes the karma for the disease and weakness that may \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;result \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from an unnatural diet to an animal? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not that all dogs who are feed a veg diet end up bei=\r\nng diseased, but the \n&gt; &gt;chances \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; increase a lot. It is like no=\r\nt all smokers die of cancer, but smoking makes \n&gt; &gt;one \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suscept=\r\nible to cancer. It increases the probability. Therefore my personal \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; opinion is that an animal if kept at home, it should taken care of in =\r\nthe \n&gt; &gt;best \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; way possible, providing it with whatever maybe ne=\r\neded, including the right \n&gt; &gt;diet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; _______________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; A question for you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Scientists studying evo=\r\nlution and human body structures have concluded that \n&gt; &gt;meat \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\neating along with cropping and fruits has been prevelant since at least 4 \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; million years. That, without a diet which was omnivorous, the struc=\r\nture of \n&gt; &gt;the \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; human stomach (lack of a developed=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\ncaecum),=C3=82=C2=A0and the threefold increase \n&gt; &gt;in=C3=82=C2=A0brain \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; size (from archeological evidences)=C3=82=C2=A0could never have be=\r\nen what it is \n&gt; &gt;today. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which means, an omnivorous diet has b=\r\neen a=C3=82=C2=A0natural process, so ingrained \n&gt; &gt;that it \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has=\r\n changed the very structure of the human body. This cannot be done \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n consciously, but only by the work of natural forces.

A few quick comments.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (1) We =\r\nare we we eat. Production of various chemicals in our body and their \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; interactions, are controlled by what we eat. Thus, what we eat has a=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;profound \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; impact on us.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2) Much has been=\r\n written on the material benefits from vegetarianism. But \n&gt; &gt;that \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; is not all. There are spiritual and subtle reasons as well.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Eating the flesh or body parts of an animal that strongly identifies=\r\n with \n&gt; &gt;the \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physical body entails a karma. Self-identificati=\r\non of plants with their \n&gt; &gt;physical \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; body is much subtler and =\r\nthe karma entailed in eating plant-based foods is \n&gt; &gt;much \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sma=\r\nller.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Especially these days, very cruel methods are used f=\r\nor meat production by \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; corporations and animals are treated very cr=\r\nuelly. Part of the karma for \n&gt; &gt;their \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suffering goes to the o=\r\nnes benefiting from their meat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) I heard an interview w=\r\nith a scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) \n&gt; &gt;several \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mon=\r\nths back. They conducted an experiment on gorillas. One set of gorillas \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;was \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fed with meat. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits et=\r\nc. After several \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; months, researchers found a gap in the intelligen=\r\nce of the two sets. The \n&gt; &gt;ones \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fed with meat were duller.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Their theory was that digestion of meat takes up more energy=\r\n. Gorillas fed \n&gt; &gt;with \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nuts and fruits may have diverted more=\r\n energy towards the development of \n&gt; &gt;brain. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though they were=\r\n not sure if the same thing applies to human beings or not, \n&gt; &gt;a \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellectual \n&gt; &gt;de=\r\nvelopment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (4) After we eat a heavy meal, we may feel dull=\r\n or sleepy and cannot focus \n&gt; &gt;well \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on work that requires ale=\r\nrtness and skill. That is because the digestive \n&gt; &gt;process \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is=\r\n using up a lot of energy (also known as agni or fire) and there isn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt;=\r\nmuch \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; agni available for other activities such as digestion of =\r\nintellectual ideas \n&gt; &gt;that \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happens in the mind. Similarly, di=\r\ngestion of spiritual ideas/experiences \n&gt; &gt;also \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; requires agni =\r\nand that cannot happen well. That is why meditation or homam \n&gt; &gt;after \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a heavy meal are fruitless and we are normally advised to do sadha=\r\nna before \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eating.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (5) If foods that light up =\r\na higher digestive agni (e.g. meats, deep fried \n&gt; &gt;food \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with =\r\nmore oil, spicy foods that stimulate digestive agni etc) are consumed \n&gt; &gt;m=\r\nore \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; frequently, agni is diverted towards digestion more often =\r\nand there is less \n&gt; &gt;agni \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; available for assimilaring intellec=\r\ntual and spiritual ideas and \n&gt; &gt;experiences. If \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one eats saat=\r\ntwik food that is very easy to digest (simple grains, simple \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lenti=\r\nls and simple vegetables, all softly cooked with mild spices, and \n&gt; &gt;fruit=\r\ns), \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; less agni is diverted towards digestion and more agni is a=\r\nvailable for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and exp=\r\neriences.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (6) Even a big fire cannot burn wet grass well. =\r\nBut huge stacks of dry \n&gt; &gt;grass may \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be burnt by just one spar=\r\nk! Similarly, little bit of internal fire may be \n&gt; &gt;enough \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to=\r\n assimilate spiritual ideas and experiences in a person with excellent \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; vaasanas and few obstructions (dry grass). A lot of internal fire may =\r\nbe \n&gt; &gt;needed \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a person with poor vaasanas and many obstruct=\r\nions (wet grass). Thus, it \n&gt; &gt;all \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; depends on vaasanas and imp=\r\nurities in nadis and chakras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One person may eat meat and =\r\ndeep fried foods, spend a lot of agni on \n&gt; &gt;digesting \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them an=\r\nd yet make excellent spiritual progress. Another person may eat \n&gt; &gt;saattwi=\r\nk \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; food, maximize the agni available for spiritual transformati=\r\non and yet \n&gt; &gt;struggle \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to progress spiritually. However, the =\r\nbest course of action for one is to \n&gt; &gt;ignore \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; counter-example=\r\ns and be a vegetarian. All other things being equal, that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; maximize=\r\ns the agni available for spiritual progress.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (7) Regarding=\r\n Priya&#39;s question: Animals have their own vaasanas and their \n&gt; &gt;needs. \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, fee=\r\nd the poor \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fellow whatever he/she needs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (8) =\r\nOne should eat to live and not live to eat. A yogi should consume \n&gt; &gt;enoug=\r\nh \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; food to sustain oneself so that one can fulfil one&#39;s dharma =\r\nin the material \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; world using physical body and make spiritual p=\r\nrogress. Eating too much food \n&gt; &gt;is \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not good for spiritual sa=\r\ndhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Instead of overeating most of the time and fasting =\r\non specific days, it is \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better to eat limited amount always. Re=\r\ngular practices are more important \n&gt; &gt;for \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; transformation and =\r\nsuccess, than occasional practices.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (9) By merely thinking=\r\n that god is the doer of all actions or considering \n&gt; &gt;food \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\no be god&#39;s prasad, one cannot escape the karma involved. It depends on how =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deeply ingrained that thought is and how deeply one feels so. =\r\nIf one \n&gt; &gt;internally \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feels 100% that god is acting through on=\r\ne and whatever one is doing (e.g. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eating) is just god&#39;s prasad to =\r\none, then one is free.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fre=\r\ne Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It =\r\nYourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://=\r\nwww.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://Sarasw=\r\natiFilms.org \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wis=\r\ndom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
