Next=\r\n to the Kaali shrine, there was a Krishna shrine with a beautiful Krishna i=\r\ndol and Ramakrishna used to meditate there sometimes.

The shastras were clear that a broken=\r\n idol could not be worshipped at a temple and had to be immersed in flowing=\r\n water. So the learned scholars recommended immersing the idol in Ganges.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nRamakrishna was asked by the temple administration for his view. He =\r\nthought for a while and said calmly, &quot;Suppose you have a son and his leg is=\r\n broken. Will you try to fix it and keep the son at home and continue to lo=\r\nve him or will you throw your son into Ganges?&quot; His simple common sense vie=\r\nw prevailed and shastras were set aside! In fact, Ramakrishna himself fixed=\r\n the broken idol. It was re-installed at the temple and continued to be wor=\r\nshipped.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nThe idol was in your house for 56 y=\r\nears. Suddenly, the new found knowledge is creating problems in your mind, =\r\nafter all these years! What good is that knowledge which spoils mental peac=\r\ne by creating doubts, fear=C2=A0and insecurity? One is better off being ign=\r\norant than having such knowledge.\n=C2=A0\nIf you have an idol that was worsh=\r\nipped to some extent by your ancestors for 56 years, it would&#39;ve captured a=\r\nnd stored some of the positive energy and positive thoughts of those people=\r\n. It would be a great blessing to have at your house.\n=C2=A0\nIt should not =\r\nbe a problem if you cannot do much ritual worshp to the idol. Just doing si=\r\nmple things should suffice.\n=C2=A0\nWhenever you see the idol, imagine that =\r\nthere is Ganesha in it for real. Love the Ganesa who is in that idol. Bow t=\r\no him now and then, when you get a chance. Show some fruit or raisins or so=\r\nmething to the idol now and then, when you get a chance, and imagine that G=\r\nanesa tasted them. Every few months, clean the idol in water and wipe it (t=\r\no keep it clean).\n=C2=A0\nThe key is not how detailed your rituals are and w=\r\nhether you are doing 5 or 16 or 64 or more services in your ritual. The key=\r\n is how strongly you imagine a real deity in that idol and how deeply you l=\r\nove that real deity that you visualize in the idol. Rituals are only meant =\r\nto facilitate such a visualization and increase such a love. They are neith=\r\ner necessary nor sufficient for establishing a relationship with a deity (w=\r\nhich is, after all, the purpose of keeping an idol)!\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n*\n=C2=A0\nHow does a metallic (or stone or whatever) object become divine?\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nOf course, each object and each atom of this universe is filled, in =\r\nessence, by Aatman or Brahman, i.e. non-dual god. But, that would apply to =\r\nthe idol as well as a sofa. But you look at an idol as being more divine th=\r\nan the sofa. So we are not talking about the all-pervading non-dual god her=\r\ne. We are talking about a deity within the field of duality here. That deit=\r\ny is not present in sofa, but present in the idol. But, how does the deity =\r\nget into the idol? Does the idol get that deity in it simply because of its=\r\n shape? Of course not!\n=C2=A0\nAll lokas and all devatas are present within =\r\nyou in a microcosmic form. By the force of your thought, you concentrate a =\r\npart of the deity who is within you into the idol (or any object). When a p=\r\nriest with a good level of purity and good ability to visualize (which come=\r\ns from internal purity and lack of ego) does praana pratishthaa in an idol,=\r\n his visualization works using the praana pratishthaa mantra as an instrume=\r\nnt and a deity&#39;s essence enters the idol.\n=C2=A0\nEven if you do not do a pr=\r\naana pratishthaa formally, deity&#39;s essence will slowly be established in th=\r\ne idol if you keep imagining deity in the idol. It is all about the power o=\r\nf thought! Thoughts of a pure mind that is not weighed down by a dense and =\r\nheavy ego and not colored by too many terrible vaasanaas work faster, but e=\r\nven thoughts of an impure=C2=A0mind that is weighed down by a dense and hea=\r\nvy ego and colored by several terrible vaasanaas will also work, albeit=C2=\r\n=A0slowly. If you keep imagining a deity with some qualities in an idol ove=\r\nr a long time, essence=C2=A0of such a deity will invariably be established =\r\nin the idol over the time! Otherwise, it is just a metallic object.\n=C2=A0\n=\r\nIf you imagine a deity who is angry with you for not taking good care of hi=\r\nm, you will slowly create such a form in that idol. Please stop this negati=\r\nvity. Imagine a beautiful, pleasant, happy=C2=A0and saattwika form with who=\r\nm you can fall in love. If a feeling of love overwhelms your mind when you =\r\nsee the idol (instead of thoughts of fear and deity&#39;s anger), it will indee=\r\nd create such a presence in the idol and do you good.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n*\n=C2=A0\nThere are several *well-meaning* people out there with half-baked =\r\nunderstanding that is not based on any direct experience, who go around sca=\r\nring people in several matters relating to god, religion and spirituality. =\r\nBut god is not to be feared.\n=C2=A0\nLove god. Do not fear god. When your fa=\r\nther or mother shout at you or punish you, it=C2=A0is for a good reason and=\r\n it will eventually be for your good. They are not really angry at you and =\r\nthey actually love you. Similarly, when god punishes you or gives bad resul=\r\nts, it is for a good reason and it will eventually be for your good. Do not=\r\n fear god even when god gives you bad results. Always *love* god and love g=\r\nod very deeply. More deeply than you love your parents, spouse, children et=\r\nc.

Please stop this negativity. Imagine a beautiful, pleasant, happy&=\r\nnbsp;and saattwika form with whom you can fall in love. If a feeling of lov=\r\ne overwhelms your mind when you see the idol (instead of thoughts of fear a=\r\nnd deity&#39;s anger), it will indeed create such a presence in the idol and do=\r\n you good.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT f=\r\nace=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\nFONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;There are several *well-meaning* people out ther=\r\ne with half-baked understanding that is not based on any direct experience,=\r\n who go around scaring people in several matters relating to god, religion =\r\nand spirituality.

This idol has its trunk to the right side and=\r\n has been there in our house since the last 56 years. I recently came to kn=\r\now that when an idol of Shri Ganesha with its trunk to the right is kept at=\r\n home one needs to worship it daily in a dedicated way and we have honestly=\r\n not being doing this all these years. It was infact purchased by my grandm=\r\nother 56 years ago as per my father who has been seeing it since then. &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I feel that it is better to donate it to a temple which would=\r\n worship it daily. As it has been there for so long in the house we are fee=\r\nling hesitant about doing this. Would be extremely grateful if I could have=\r\n\n advice as to what would be the correct thing to do and how to go about do=\r\ning the same.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Kindly pardon me if this is not the appropri=\r\nate forum for such a query.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thanks,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ramesh M&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Bangalore &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n  =\r\n    \r\n--0-765564768-1251997644=:61816--\r\n\n"}}
