The guru was very very\n&gt; &gt; advanced, a legend in h=\r\nis own right. And he told the guru you know I\n&gt; &gt; wanna be on the same leve=\r\nl you are and the guru said if you wanna be on\n&gt; &gt; the same level I&#39;m on, I=\r\n&#39;ll met you tomorrow at the beach.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So the young man got there 4 A.=\r\nM. he was  all ready to rock n&#39; roll.\n&gt; &gt; He was dressed properly, but he s=\r\nhould have worn shorts. The old man\n&gt; &gt; grabs his hand and said: How bad do=\r\n you wanna be successful (basically\n&gt; &gt; achieve god, have siddhi and the li=\r\nke, all references to success from\n&gt; &gt; hereon now mean uniting with god) ? =\r\nHe said: &quot;Real bad&quot;. He\n&gt; &gt; said: Walk on out in the water. So he walks out=\r\n into the water.

I didn&#39;t ask to be a lifeguard. I\n&gt; &gt; wanna meet god he got me in wat=\r\ner =96 so the old man said go on a\n&gt; &gt; little further =96 the young man wal=\r\nked out a little further =96\n&gt; &gt; then the young man was neck deep in water =\r\n- the young man was thinking \n&gt; &gt; this old man is crazy =96 everybody calls=\r\n him a paramhansa, a\n&gt; &gt; mahapurusha, god incarnate but he is definitely cr=\r\nazy. So the old man\n&gt; &gt; again said go on out a little further =96 the young=\r\n man went out a\n&gt; &gt; little further, the water was now right at his mouth =\r\n=96the young man\n&gt; &gt; was now thinking of going back, this old hack is out o=\r\nf his fucking\n&gt; &gt; mind. And then the old man said: &quot;I thought you said you =\r\nwanted to\n&gt; &gt; be successful?&quot; He said: &quot;I do.&quot; He said: &quot;Then walk a\n&gt; &gt; li=\r\nttle further.&quot; Then the old man followed this guy into the water,\n&gt; &gt; he gr=\r\nabbed the young man&#39;s head, and held him down underwater. The old\n&gt; &gt; guy h=\r\neld the young man, till  the young man was about to pass out, the\n&gt; &gt; young=\r\n guys arms were now splashing the water in desperation, then\n&gt; &gt; suddenly t=\r\nhe guru raised him up. He said: &quot;I got a question for\n&gt; &gt; you.&quot; He told the=\r\n young guy, he said: &quot;When you want to succeed\n&gt; &gt; as bad as you wanna brea=\r\nthe than you will be successful.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; (Succeed =3D uniting with god, or see=\r\ning god, or achieving supernatural\n&gt; &gt; powers, or siddhi, or whatever, that=\r\ns subjective, upto you.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know how many of you all got asth=\r\nma here in Vedic wisdom?

The only thing you care about when you trying to breathe is to\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; get some fresh air. That&#39;s it! And when you get to the point where\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nall you wanna do is be is successful as bad as you wanna breathe then\n&gt; &gt; y=\r\nou will be successful.

But errrrrr=85=85=85=85\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; what did you do post that???\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t see people shortening the=\r\nir mall trips, their shopping sprees,\n&gt; &gt; their time on the internet but wh=\r\nen it comes to a homam, first question\n&gt; &gt; or thought is &quot;oh my gawd, it wi=\r\nll take that long, let me ask Mr Rao of\n&gt; &gt; making it shorter.&quot; And god is =\r\nso magnanimous, he allows you to do so.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hell you spend more time o=\r\nn buying your kacche, panty, banyan and bras\n&gt; &gt; rather than on god!!!!!! W=\r\nah, wah, surely god will be yours.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Then you pick up books, all sor=\r\nt of books read all about other guys\n&gt; &gt; reaching god, start reading into t=\r\nheir experiences, start discussing\n&gt; &gt; about their high spiritual states an=\r\nd everything, and get lost  in\n&gt; &gt; arguing over those discussions. Then pos=\r\nt apologies, my goodness, the\n&gt; &gt; noise. Waste of a human birth, if you wer=\r\ne to see the line waiting for a\n&gt; &gt; human womb, and then realize &quot;I&quot; have t=\r\no stand at the end of this line,\n&gt; &gt; you would piss yourself. Some girl aft=\r\ner seeing it did, and has always\n&gt; &gt; been a little urgent with her sadhana =\r\never since then.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I see this question getting asked a lot, that &quot;ho=\r\nw do you find a\n&gt; &gt; guru????&quot;\n&gt; &gt; And you know everyone, wants a high power=\r\ned one, not any other will do.\n&gt; &gt; See a high powered guru, also requires a=\r\n good disciple.\n&gt; &gt; Are you good enough, honestly answer this??? Many will =\r\nsay no, many will\n&gt; &gt; say good or not, its the guru&#39;s job to deal with it e=\r\ntc etc, but are you\n&gt; &gt; willing to work on yourself to spare the guru some =\r\nwork???? Why would a\n&gt; &gt; high powered one come and teach you??? only after =\r\nyour penance is good\n&gt; &gt; enough na? otherwise, he/she will be busy in his/h=\r\ner union with god.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now how bad do you want god?\n&gt; &gt; How bad d=\r\no you want a guru?\n&gt; &gt;   How bad do you want those spiritual states?\n&gt; &gt; Ho=\r\nw bad do you want the darsahn for your beloved?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t kind of want=\r\n it, want it bad, time is running out, and very soon,\n&gt; &gt; another rebirth, =\r\nagain the young age, again the teenage, again the\n&gt; &gt; affairs, again the ho=\r\nrmone spikes, again the degrees, again the sucky\n&gt; &gt; jobs, again confused w=\r\nith life, again the financial nightmares, again\n&gt; &gt; the heart attacks , aga=\r\nin the death, and again, again. Hai ram!!!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll end this post wit=\r\nh an example, a businessman in Delhi in the\n&gt; &gt; 1940&#39;s, had done a bit of p=\r\nenance and you know was highly interested in\n&gt; &gt; god , shod and all this st=\r\nuff. So one day , he had gone to kerala, and\n&gt; &gt; met a guy who was proclaim=\r\ned in the village to be equivalent to lord\n&gt; &gt; voldmeort or something but o=\r\nn the god side.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So the guy went to meet the guy whose name can&#39;t b=\r\ne taken and asked him\n&gt; &gt; , i am looking for a guru, the old fella said , f=\r\nor what exactly are you\n&gt; &gt; looking for a guru??? The business man said, , =\r\nyou know to learn stuff.\n&gt; &gt; The old fellow said what are you willing to do=\r\n for your guru??? The\n&gt; &gt; businessman said anything. The old fella said, ok=\r\nay take all your\n&gt; &gt; clothes off, the businessman was shocked. the suit guy=\r\n took them off\n&gt; &gt; reluctantly. then the old fella, told him , wear a patta=\r\n around your\n&gt; &gt; neck and roam around the town naked. The businessman was a=\r\nghast, but the\n&gt; &gt; old fella, told him &quot;anything right???&quot;, the businessman=\r\n very BADLY\n&gt; &gt; wanted a guru, so he went and got shoes thrown at him, came=\r\n back after\n&gt; &gt; half an hour to find the old fella gone and his clothes gon=\r\ne too. He sat\n&gt; &gt; there sobbing, and sobbing and cursing god, that i was th=\r\ne biggest fool\n&gt; &gt; to come here and trust this man. But then as he haid rea=\r\nd somewhere, why\n&gt; &gt; waste time, he started meditating and chanted. 3 hours=\r\n went by no sign\n&gt; &gt; of the old man, 4 then 5 but by the 6th, the old fella=\r\n reappeared, and\n&gt; &gt; said &quot; here are your clothes, go back to your town.&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The businessman just didn&#39;t want to say anything tried to get up, b=\r\nut\n&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t move. The old fella was weeping with joy, stating that fina=\r\nlly\n&gt; &gt; he has found someone worthy enough to teach.
