This combination is known as &quot;Krishna Sh=\r\nani Trayodasi&quot; and is a very very powerful day to propitiate Saturn. Especi=\r\nally, with Saturn in a deep gandanta in an inimical sign right now, it is g=\r\nood to pray to Saturn.\n \nEven if you are not being troubled by Saturn, you =\r\ncan still pray for the world and for many others who are being troubled.\n \n=\r\nIn fact, when you pray to a deity, you can just pray for the pleasure of th=\r\ne deity involved rather than any other thing. Other things are secondary. S=\r\naturn is not too pleased right now with his position and we can pray to ple=\r\nase him.\n \nI am about to go into my Shani japam and homam and I realized th=\r\nat Trayodasi will be almost over by the time I come back and so hurriedly s=\r\nending this mail.\n \nYou can download a small Shani mantram as mp3 from my w=\r\nebsite (link below, go to mantras). You can also pray to Saturn as the Koor=\r\nma (gaint Tortoise) form of Vishnu. Both are identical, according to Parasa=\r\nra. The higher form of Saturn is Koorma Deva. Just as Koorma Deva supported=\r\n the churning of milky ocean with mount Manthara to get amrita (nectar), th=\r\ne patience, discipline, spirit of hard work and austerity within us (Saturn=\r\n within us) supports the churning of the milky ocean within us. Milky ocean=\r\n within us is our spiritual essence, Mt Manthara is Sushumna nadi, churning=\r\n is the spiritual sadhana (pursuit) and the nectar sought is nothing but Sa=\r\nt-chid-aananda (the true bliss of just being). Anyway, you can pray to Shan=\r\ni with the dwadasakshari mantra for Koorma Deva:\n \nOm NamoBhagavate Akoopar=\r\naaya\n \nThe other Shani mantra can be downloaded from my website in audio fo=\r\nrm.\n \nBTW, I promised a manual on a one-hour Mahaganapathi Homam procedure =\r\nthat can be performed by interested people. Now I actually have a detailed =\r\n25-page manual giving minute instructions and all mantras and also a 55 min=\r\nute mp3 audio that records the entire procedure. Interested people can read=\r\n the document, understand the procedure and then perform the homam by thems=\r\nelves while playing the mp3 (no need to say any mantra by themselves). It i=\r\ns my hope that more and more people will start performing regular Mahaganap=\r\nathi homam, on a daily/weekly/monthly basis. I have done different kinds of=\r\n sadhanas, but there is none like a daily homam. I will upload the document=\r\n and mp3 somewhere on the internet and send links soon.\n \nBTW, I am not rea=\r\nding any of these yahoogroups. If you need my attention, please send a priv=\r\nate mail. But, unfortunately, I am getting only 10 min everyday to read and=\r\n reply to mails and I get a lot of mails. My sincere apologies if I am unab=\r\nle to help you. Please don&#39;t take offense. Even if I cannot help you direct=\r\nly, I will be praying to Mother to somehow give direction to everybody who =\r\nsought direction from me and failed to get a response from me.\n \nMay the li=\r\nght of Brahman shine within, \nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro=\r\n.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrolog=\r\ner.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_00F9_01C70AE7.E186F5F0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.2995&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaska=\r\nr friends,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Today is Krishna Trayodasi tithi (13th l=\r\nunar day in \nthe waning fortnight) and a Saturday.
