Cells die because they want to=\r\n.

Wh=\r\nen the process is\ncomplete, the cell has dissolved and leaves no trace behi=\r\nnd.\n\nWhen we read this graphic account of a cell sacrificing itself so\nmeth=\r\nodically, you can=E2=80=99t help being touched. Yet the mystical part is st=\r\nill\nto come. Apoptosis isn=E2=80=99t a way to get rid of sick or old cells,=\r\n as you\nmight suppose. The process gave us birth. As embryos in the womb, e=\r\nach of\nus passed through primitive stages of development when we had tadpol=\r\ne\ntails, fishlike gills, webbing between our fingers, and most surprisingly=\r\n,\ntoo many brain cells. Apoptosis took care of these unwanted vestiges=E2=\r\n=80=94in the\ncase of the brain, a newborn baby forms proper neural connecti=\r\nons by\nremoving the excess brain tissue that we were all born with. (It cam=\r\ne as a\nsurprise when neurologists discovered that our brains contain the mo=\r\nst\ncells at birth, a number which gets whittled down by the millions so tha=\r\nt\nhigher intelligence can forge its delicate web of connections. It was lon=\r\ng\nthought that killing off brain cells was a pathological process associate=\r\nd\nwith aging. Now the whole issue must be reconsidered.)\n\nApoptosis doesn=\r\n=E2=80=99t end in the womb, however. Our bodies continue to thrive\non death=\r\n. The immune cells that engulf and consume invading bacteria would\nturn on =\r\nthe body=E2=80=99s own tissues if they didn=E2=80=99t induce death in each =\r\nother\nand then turn on themselves with the same poisons used against invade=\r\nrs.\nWhenever any cell detects that its DNA is damaged or defective, it know=\r\ns\nthat the body will suffer if this defect is\npassed on. Fortunately, every=\r\n cell carries a poison gene known as p53 that\ncan be activated to make itse=\r\nlf die.\n\nThese few facts barely scratch the surface. Anatomists long ago kn=\r\new that\nskin cells die every few days;that retinal cells, red blood cells, =\r\nand\nstomach cells also are programmed with specific short life spans so tha=\r\nt\ntheir tissues can be quickly replenished. Each dies for its own unique\nre=\r\nason. Skin cells have to be sloughed off so that our skin remains supple,\nw=\r\nhile stomach cells die as part of the potent chemical combustion that\ndiges=\r\nts food.\n\nDeath cannot be our enemy if we have depended upon it from the wo=\r\nmb.\nConsider the following irony.As it turns out, the body is capable of ta=\r\nking\na vacation from death by producing cells that decide to live forever. =\r\nThese\ncells don=E2=80=99t trigger p53 when they detect defects in their own=\r\n DNA. And by\nrefusing to issue their own death warrants, these cells divide=\r\n relentlessly\nand invasively. Cancer, the most feared of\ndiseases, is the b=\r\nody=E2=80=99s vacation from death, while programmed death is its\nticket to =\r\nlife. This is the paradox of life and death confronted head on.\nThe mystica=\r\nl notion of dying every day turns out to be the body=E2=80=99s most\nconcret=\r\ne fact.\n\nWhat this means is that we are exquisitely sensitive to the balanc=\r\ne of\npositive and negative forces, and when the balance is tipped, death is=\r\n the\nnatural response. Nietzsche once remarked that humans are the only\ncre=\r\natures who must be encouraged to stay alive. He couldn=E2=80=99t have known=\r\n that\nthis is literally true.Cells receive positive signals that tell them =\r\nto\nstay alive=E2=80=94chemicals called growth factors. If these positive si=\r\ngnals are\nwithdrawn, the cell loses its will to live. Like the Mafia=E2=80=\r\n=99s kiss of death,\nthe cell can also be sent messengers that bind to its o=\r\nuter receptors to\nsignal that death has arrived=E2=80=94these chemical mess=\r\nengers are actually known\nas =E2=80=9Cdeath activators.=E2=80=9D\n\nA Harvard=\r\n Medical School professor had discovered an amazing fact.
