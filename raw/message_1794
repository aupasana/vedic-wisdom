I pic=\r\nked on &quot;om gam ganapataye namah&quot; because it is short and simple. \n\nMy curio=\r\nusity has been aroused about the different &quot;quality&quot; of mantras. The above =\r\nmantra is supposed to be a &quot;moola&quot; mantra and also a &quot;bija&quot; mantra for gana=\r\npati. Can you explain the significance of this?As a remover of obstacles wh=\r\nich other mantra would you suggest for ganapati? i am drawn to &quot;aum vakratu=\r\nndaya hum&quot; also, but do not know how to pronounce the mantra correctly and =\r\nneither do i know what is the &quot;correct&quot; intonation for this. Should i stick=\r\n to one main mantra only? Today, the mahamrityunjaya mantra came spontaneou=\r\nsly towards the end of the homam and i found myself reciting it mentally. S=\r\nhould i resist doing this since you have advised that i should do Ganapati =\r\nmantra at least for a month?\n\nThankyou\n\nRegards and best wishes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
