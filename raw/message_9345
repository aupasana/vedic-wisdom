This is the question.\n\nWe=\r\n shall take up one aspect of the question, Vedanta simply asks, &quot;Can a swor=\r\nd kill your enemies?&quot;\n\nIf this question may be answered in the affirmative,=\r\n then the question &quot;as to whether a worldly householder can realize Truth p=\r\nerfectly,&quot; can also be answered in the affirmative; it all depends upon the=\r\n use we make of the sword or of the family ties. We can make the same sword=\r\n kill or protect us from outside attacks: so a man by the misuse of family =\r\nties or family relations can kill himself, or retard his spiritual growth, =\r\nor by the right use of the family relations he can elevate himself, and rea=\r\nlize God within him. Thus the question is similarly answered.&quot;.............=\r\n\n\n........&quot;There was a very good man who kept a very naughty and wicked ser=\r\nvant. He used to do everything in a wrong way; he used to carry out the com=\r\nmands of his master in a curious way; in fact his way of doing things was s=\r\nuch as to upset even the most serious man. This faithful master was never a=\r\nnnoyed, but always treated the servant in a most charming manner. At one ti=\r\nme one of the guests remonstrated against the servant; he was very much ann=\r\noyed and displeased with his actions and asked the master to dismiss him. T=\r\nhe master said, &quot;Your advice is very good, and it is given with the best in=\r\ntention; I know that you wish me well; I know that you want my work and bus=\r\niness to prosper, and it is on that account that you give me this advice; b=\r\nut I know better, I know that my work is being spoiled, I know that my busi=\r\nness suffers. But I keep this servant on the very ground or from the very f=\r\nact of his being so unfaithful; it is his bad conduct and his wicked habits=\r\n which make him so dear to me. I love him the more because he is a sinner, =\r\na wicked and unfaithful servant&quot;. This was a very strange way of speaking.\n=\r\n\nThe master said, &quot;This servant is the only person in the world or with who=\r\nm I come in contact, that disobeys me; he is the only person who does thing=\r\ns which are uncomplimentary, derogatory or detrimental to me. All others wi=\r\nth whom I come in contact are so gentle, so pleasant, so loving that they d=\r\nare not offend me, and so this man is out of the ordinary; he is a kind of =\r\ndumbbells, a kind of special training to my spiritual Self. Just as many pe=\r\nople use dumb-bells, pulleys, or heavy weights to exercise the muscles in o=\r\nrder to develop their physical strength, so this servant serves as a kind o=\r\nf weight or dumb-bells by which my spiritual body is strengthened. Through =\r\nthis servant I get strength. I am compelled to do a kind of wrestling with =\r\nthis servant, which brings strength&quot;.......\n\n..........&quot;The earth revolves =\r\nround the sun. The earth must revolve. The moon wants to cling: to the eart=\r\nh. What is the earth to do? The earth can take up the moon and satellites, =\r\nand together with them the earth can revolve round the sun. \n\nSo, O man or =\r\nwoman, if you have set up the task of being drawn towards the Sun of suns, =\r\ntake your companion with you, as the earth does the moon, and with your com=\r\npanion, like the moon, go on revolving round the Sun of suns, the Light of =\r\nlights. Thus instead of making this one little body partake of the glory, l=\r\night and lustre of the Sun, you can make your companion share with you the =\r\nglory and light and lustre of the same Sun. Thus instead of drawing but one=\r\n soul, you can draw other souls. Instead of working through just one body, =\r\nyou can work through many bodies. They are all yours. All those bodies (as =\r\none body belongs to you) can belong to God, can glorify God. When a man goe=\r\ns to a place and takes only one body with him, but he does not leave the he=\r\nad, the hands, the nose, the eyes, the ears, &c. behind; they all go. Simil=\r\narly, Vedanta tells you that when you approach the knowledge of heaven, whe=\r\nn you realize the Truth, instead of carrying one-half of you to the knowled=\r\nge of heaven, you can take all; you can take the wife and children, you can=\r\n take along your head, your heart, your hands, as it were.&quot;.......\n\nAn old =\r\nlady came to a saint in India and asked if it was advisable for her to leav=\r\ne her house and her family, and to retire to Brindaban (in India), where Kr=\r\nishna was born. Was it advisaable for her to break her family ties, and sev=\r\ner all her relations with each and all, and retire to that lovely city, Bri=\r\nndaban, the Jerusalem of India?\n\nThis lady had her grandson with her. The s=\r\nage replied, &quot;See please, mark please, what is it that looks into your eyes=\r\n through the eyes of your grandson? What force, what energy, what I divinit=\r\ny is it that looks at you from every pore of the body of this child?&quot;The la=\r\ndy said, &quot;It must be God. In this dear little baby there is no thought of t=\r\nemptation or wickedness. This dear little baby is innocent and pure. When h=\r\ne cries, in his wailing is the voice of God and nothing else.&quot;Again the sag=\r\ne said, &quot;When you go to Brindaban, you shall have to cling to the one image=\r\n of Krishna. There in the Jerusalem of India, and there in that image of Di=\r\nvinity, you must worship the Divinity. Is not the body of the child just as=\r\n good an image of Krishna as the image you shall have to see in that Jerusa=\r\nlem of India.?&quot;The lady was surprised a little; and after thinking and refl=\r\necting, she came to the conclusion that she might just as well worship Kris=\r\nhna through the body of this child, by regarding this child as the incarnat=\r\nion of Krishna. For God it is that looks through the eyes of the child; God=\r\n it is that gives the child its power; God it is that works through the ear=\r\ns of the child; God it is that makes the child&#39;s hair grow; God it is that =\r\nworks through every pore of his body; it is Divinity.\n\nAccording to the dir=\r\nection of the saint, she must no longer regard the child as her grandson, o=\r\nr look upon him as related to her in any way, but must regard him as God, a=\r\nnd thus break all family and worldly ties. The only tie should be the tie o=\r\nf Godliness or Godhead. This is the way to Renunciation.\n\nRenunciation does=\r\n not mean asceticism. Renunciation means making everything holy. Renouncing=\r\n the child does not mean giving up all connection with the child but thinki=\r\nng the child, the grandson, to be God. Realizing the Divinity in each and a=\r\nll: this is Renunciation according to Vedanta. Vedanta asks you to give up =\r\nyour wife or your husband and other relations. Vedanta says, a Give up the =\r\nwife as related to you, give up the wife as the wife, but realize the true =\r\nSelf, the Divinity within her. Give up the enemy as the enemy, see only the=\r\n God in the enemy; give up the friend as a friend, but realize the Godlines=\r\ns or Godhead in the friend.&quot;\n\n\nThe full article is very interesting and wel=\r\nl worth a read. \n\nhttp://ramatirtha.com/married-life-and-realization\n\n\n"}}
