There are different kinds of samadhi and they can be experienced di=\r\nfferently by different people, as you said. You correctly questioned how di=\r\nfferent people can describe &quot;Nirvikalpa samadhi&quot; differently.\n=C2=A0\nThe is=\r\nsue is this. Nirvikalpa samadhi is a state of being where there is no &quot;expe=\r\nriencer&quot;, nothing &quot;to experience&quot; and also no act of &quot;experiencing&quot;. In oth=\r\ner words, there is no observer (subject), observed (object) and observing (=\r\naction). All merge into one.\n=C2=A0\nWhen I-ness (the sense that &quot;this is I.=\r\n There are others. I can observe them&quot;) disappears, what is the basis for a=\r\nny objectification in the Supreme Cosmic Essence? If there is no objectific=\r\nation, how can there be any experience or observation? If there is no obser=\r\nvation and experience, how can you describe Nirvikalpa samadhi?\n=C2=A0\nBott=\r\nomline is that there is nothing to describe in Nirvikalpa samadhi. Regardin=\r\ng Nirvikalpa samadhi, Manish once said to me: &quot;When I am in Nirvikalpa sama=\r\ndhi, there is no experience. Thus, anything I say about the &quot;experience&quot; of=\r\n Nirvikalpa samadhi is actually the observation of an I-ness as it is being=\r\n torn down or being reconstructed, i.e. just before or after Nirvikalpa sam=\r\nadhi but not *during* it.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nThis is essentially the problem with &quot;des=\r\ncribing&quot; Nirvikalpa samadhi!\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nIn terms of the=\r\n diamond analogy quoted by Kishore, what different yogis are saying about t=\r\nhe &quot;experience&quot; of Nirvikalpa samadhi says more about the path they are tak=\r\ning into the inside of the diamond, rather than describing the inside of th=\r\ne diamond itself. One may think &quot;nothing really exists apart from Brahman -=\r\n all this I am perceiving is a delusion&quot;. Another may think &quot;all I perceive=\r\n is actually Brahman&quot;. Another may think &quot;all that I perceive is actually a=\r\n minute part of Krishna&quot;. And so on. Once one is able to focus I-ness on a =\r\nspecific thought and everything else disappears from the mind, one is in sa=\r\nmadhi. Once that I-ness also disappears, one is in Nirvikalpa samadhi. Howe=\r\nver, one can only describe the last thought on which I-ness was focused pri=\r\nor to Nirvikalpa samadhi and NOT the Nirvikalpa samadhi itself.\n=C2=A0\nSome=\r\n yogis prefer the stage just before Nirvikalpa samadhi where a trace of I-n=\r\ness is left in an intense focus on one thought, to Nirvikalpa samadhi itsel=\r\nf. In the former, there is an experience and bliss - some rasa (juice).

However, one who is not at Bu=\r\nddha&#39;s wavelength can easily misunderstand it. If an observer exists and ob=\r\nserves &quot;void&quot;, that is different. What we are talking about here is the abs=\r\nence of observer, i.e. merging of observer, observed and the act of observi=\r\nng into one, without ANY distinction whatsoever between them. Is &quot;void&quot; the=\r\n right word to describe that state or is &quot;everything&quot; the right word? Is th=\r\nere a good way to describe it? Problem is that the word &quot;void&quot; may make peo=\r\nple imagine a scenario where there is an observer, but a void to observe.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------\n=C2=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons,=\r\n Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitr=\r\ni Tarpana:\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.o=\r\nrg \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ve=\r\ndic-wisdom\n=C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWr=\r\nitings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n=\r\n=C2=A0\n--- On Tue, 12/29/09, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\nFrom: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] =\r\nSamadhi\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Tuesday, December 29, 2009, =\r\n1:27 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      Namaste,\n=C2=A0\nI un=\r\nderstand the example given in that superb mail, yet some confusion exist (i=\r\nn my understanding) .\n=C2=A0\nSee, Sri Ramakrishna, when he was asked about =\r\nNirvikalpa Samadhi said he cannot describe it in words like the salt doll e=\r\nxample provided by Hari. \n=C2=A0\n&gt; After all, Rigveda says &quot;ekam sat vipraa=\r\n bahudhaa vadanti&quot;, which means\n&gt; &quot;Truth is One, but the learned call diffe=\r\nrently&quot; . \n=C2=A0\nTrue. Now I see this line in different ways - 1) As diffe=\r\nrent saints have mentioned different sadhanas/paths to achieve God. 2) Seco=\r\nndly as you mentioned, that Truth is One, but saints call it differently.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nFrom=C2=A0from the diamond analogy I understand that if=C2=A0X reach=\r\nes a certain face of the diamond and Y reaches another face of the diamond,=\r\n they percieve it differently, thought both faces are the same diamond, jus=\r\nt different aspects. This is OK. This can be equal to savikalpa samadhi and=\r\n may be experienced differently depending upon the individual.\n=C2=A0\nNow\n=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; As you break through any face of the diamond\n&gt; and jump into the i=\r\nnterior of the diamond, you no longer perceive the faces=C2=A0 \n&gt; of the di=\r\namond or the world outside. There are no longer any objects or \n&gt; attribute=\r\ns.=C2=A0 There is no I-ness or It-ness or experience. The experiencer, \n&gt; e=\r\nxperienced and experience all merge into one.\n=C2=A0\n1) This seems logical =\r\nand is also the main cause of my confusion. When=C2=A0we say that we enter =\r\nthe middle of the diamond, when duality is no more, then how can it=C2=A0be=\r\n experienced differently by different people? Shouldn&#39;t it be=C2=A0 the sam=\r\ne? I thought, whichever face of teh diamond you chose as your entry point, =\r\nthe middle of teh diamond should feel and look exactly similar. Please corr=\r\nect me if I am wrong in my understanding.=C2=A0=C2=A0And yet these three sp=\r\niritual gaints have spoken differently of their realizations. If duality it=\r\nself does not exist, then how can the field of possiblity at all arise? Whi=\r\nch means, how can there be a difference in the &quot;perception&quot; of the same One=\r\n final Truth?\n=C2=A0\n2) Not to mention the query about whether, that which =\r\nis transcendental in its basic nature (Truth/One/Middle of the diamond),=C2=\r\n=A0can=C2=A0at all be=C2=A0described from within the field of duality? Then=\r\n I wonder why these three people - saints of highest order - try to describ=\r\ne it when all descriptions are from within duality...\n=C2=A0\nConsidering th=\r\ne above, I understand the wisdom (theoritically) of why Ramakrishna refused=\r\n to describe Nirvikalpa Samadhi.=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nI also wonder whether=C2=A0th=\r\ne three saints, Sri Ramana Maharishi, Sri Aurobindo and Lord Buddha were sp=\r\neaking from teh same realization of=C2=A0the One/Truth, or was it different=\r\n kinds of realizations. By this I mean, can it be possible that there are d=\r\nifferent intermediate or not properly documented stages of samadhi apart fr=\r\nom the standard=C2=A0savikalpa/nirvikalp a/sajaha?\n=C2=A0\nPS: I can underst=\r\nand that maybe Buddha did not mention a void per se, he probably mentioned =\r\nthat there is nothing - for lack of any better words -=C2=A0and stopped fur=\r\nther discussion.

Problem is that the word &quot;voi=\r\nd&quot; may make people imagine a scenario where there is an observer, but a voi=\r\nd to observe.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; Free Jyotish So=\r\nftware, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual =\r\nmanuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n =\r\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Films that make =\r\na difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org &lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spirit=\r\nuality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; Jyotish writin=\r\ngs: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;br&gt;----------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Tue, 1=\r\n2/29/09, rajarshi nandy &lt;i&gt;&lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); margin-left:=\r\n 5px; padding-left: 5px;&quot;&gt;From: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Samadhi&lt;br&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom&lt;br&gt;Date: Tuesday, December 29, 2009, 1:27 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv759894=\r\n588&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;y=\r\ngrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;&lt;table border=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; cel=\r\nlspacing=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=3D&quot;font-family: inherit; font-style: in=\r\nherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-size: inherit; lin=\r\ne-height: inherit; font-size-adjust: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; -x-sys=\r\ntem-font: none;&quot; valign=3D&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Namaste,&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\nI understand the example given in that superb mail, yet some confusion exis=\r\nt (in my understanding) .&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;See, Sri Ramakrishna=\r\n, when he was asked about Nirvikalpa Samadhi said he cannot describe it in =\r\nwords like the salt doll example provided by Hari. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&gt; After all, Rigveda says &quot;ekam sat vipraa bahudhaa vadanti&quot;, =\r\nwhich means&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;Truth is One, but the learned call differently&quot; . &lt;/em=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;True. Now I see this line in differ=\r\nent ways - 1) As different saints have mentioned different sadhanas/paths t=\r\no achieve God. 2) Secondly as you mentioned, that Truth is One, but saints =\r\ncall it differently.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;From&nbsp;from the diamon=\r\nd analogy I understand that if&nbsp;X reaches a certain face of the diamond=\r\n and Y reaches another face of the diamond, they percieve it differently, t=\r\nhought both faces are the same diamond, just different aspects. This is OK.=\r\n This can be equal to savikalpa samadhi and may be experienced differently =\r\ndepending upon the individual.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Now&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&gt; As you break through any face of the diamond&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; and jump into the&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt; interior of the diamond, you no longer pe=\r\nrceive the faces&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; of the diamond or the world outside. There =\r\nare no longer any objects or &lt;br&gt;&gt; attributes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&nbsp; There =\r\nis no I-ness or It-ness or experience. The experiencer, &lt;span id=3D&quot;dym_exp=\r\nerience&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; class=3D&quot;ilnk&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http:=\r\n//www.answers.com/topic/experience&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; experienced and exp=\r\nerience all merge into one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;1) This seems=\r\n logical and is also the main cause of my confusion. When&nbsp;we say that =\r\nwe enter the middle of the diamond, when duality is no more, then how can i=\r\nt&nbsp;be experienced differently by different people? Shouldn&#39;t it be&nbsp=\r\n; the same? I thought, whichever face of teh diamond you chose as your entr=\r\ny point, the middle of teh diamond should feel and look exactly similar. Pl=\r\nease correct me if I am wrong in my understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet these=\r\n three spiritual gaints have spoken differently of their realizations. If d=\r\nuality itself does not exist, then how can the field of possiblity at all a=\r\nrise? Which means, how can there be a difference in the &quot;perception&quot; of the=\r\n same One final Truth?&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;2) Not to mention the q=\r\nuery about whether, that which is transcendental in its basic nature (Truth=\r\n/One/Middle of the diamond),&nbsp;can&nbsp;at all be&nbsp;described from wi=\r\nthin the field of duality? Then I wonder why these three people - saints of=\r\n highest order - try to describe it when all descriptions are from within d=\r\nuality...&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Considering the above, I understand =\r\nthe wisdom (theoritically) of why Ramakrishna refused to describe Nirvikalp=\r\na Samadhi.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;I also wonder whether&nbsp;th=\r\ne three saints, Sri Ramana Maharishi, Sri Aurobindo and Lord Buddha were sp=\r\neaking from teh same realization of&nbsp;the One/Truth, or was it different=\r\n kinds of realizations. By this I mean, can it be possible that there are d=\r\nifferent intermediate or not properly documented stages of samadhi apart fr=\r\nom the standard&nbsp;savikalpa/nirvikalp a/sajaha?&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;div&gt;PS: I can understand that maybe Buddha did not mention a void per se, =\r\nhe probably mentioned that there is nothing - for lack of any better words =\r\n-&nbsp;and stopped further discussion. Over years his words could have&nbsp=\r\n;got corrupted to some degree and people mistook it to mean Buddha was sayi=\r\nng there is a void. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;-Regards&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;Rajarshi&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;. . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size: 10=\r\npt; color: navy; font-family: Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; =\r\nface=3D&quot;Courier&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#00007f&quot;&gt;The upsurge (of consciousness) is =\r\nBhairava&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;- Shiva Sutra&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Tue, 29/12/09, Kishore Chitrapu &lt;i&gt;&lt;chitrapu@gmail.=\r\n com&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;From: Kishore Chitrapu &lt;chitrapu@gmail. com&g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Samadhi&lt;br&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups.=\r\n com&lt;br&gt;Date: Tuesday, 29 December, 2009, 9:00 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquote style=\r\n=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1049687480&quot;&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Namaste Rajarshi,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The=\r\n bright star in the sky analogy that Narasimha posted (&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; =\r\ntarget=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/messag=\r\ne/83&quot;&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 83&lt;/a&gt;) may an=\r\nswer your questions.&lt;br&gt;Few excerpts of that mail:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; After all, R=\r\nigveda says &quot;ekam sat vipraa bahudhaa vadanti&quot;, which means&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;Truth =\r\nis One, but the learned call differently&quot; . &lt;br&gt;. . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; As you br=\r\neak through any face of the diamond&lt;br&gt;&gt; and jump into the interior of t=\r\nhe diamond, you no longer perceive the faces&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; of the diamond =\r\nor the world outside.
