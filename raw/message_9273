I am just doing a thinking aloud here. Feel free to disagree :)\n \nFirstl=\r\ny, I feel, the conception of colloquially used term Bhagawan as a Superman =\r\nwith unlimited potentials way beyond what any normal human being can achiev=\r\ne, came into existence from the Vaishnava schools of Kali Yuga, who looked =\r\nat Krshna as the ultimate God on earth. It is difficult to miss the phoneti=\r\nc similarity between terms Bhagawata and Bhagawana. The Bhagawata religion =\r\nstarted from the Gita and a contemplation of the life of Krshna. All the ma=\r\njor purely Vaishnava Acharyas - Ramanujacharya, Madhavacharya, Vallavachary=\r\na, Nimbarka, Sri Chaitanya as well as the nava-naths (Dhaneshwari was the e=\r\narliest known non-sanskrit translation of the Gita) - considered, (with dif=\r\nfering nuances on the relation between jiva, paramatma, moksha etc), Krshna=\r\n as the ultimate conception of God on earth. This was aided in no less a me=\r\nasure by the delcaration of the earliest Puranas, that is Vishnu Purana and=\r\n the SB, that Krshna was a complete Avatara. Some, like the Gaudiya Vaishna=\r\nvas, went one step ahead and took a very literal view of it all and declare=\r\nd Krshna as the Ultimate Being, and the formless Paramatma, as well as Nara=\r\nyana, as merely the aura of Krshna. Rama was also intricately linked to thi=\r\ns Krshnaa-ism, but was looked at as the earlier brith of Krshna, not as a s=\r\neparate Divity in himself.\n \nWhatever the case maybe, each school had its o=\r\nwn set of established saints and scholars to vouch for their views. So it b=\r\noiled down to interpretation, which is often, as you rightly pointed out, b=\r\nased on various conditionings.\n \nWe human beings are creatures of imaginati=\r\non. Whenever an Avatar appears on the earth, most of the great Mahatmas who=\r\n appear after the Avatara, remain overawed by the character of the last Ava=\r\ntara because invariable in the context of the desh-kaal-patra of those time=\r\ns, the life of the Avatara shows actions performed which are way beyond ima=\r\ngination for *those times*. Such a situation continues until the next Avata=\r\nra comes on earth. I am sure in the period after Rama, and before Krshna, o=\r\nf which we have very little written record, the world at large remained ent=\r\nirely overawed by Rama Avatara.\n \nIn this light Krshna is the Poorna-Avatar=\r\na. When Kalki will appear on earth, he will be invarible accompanied by a s=\r\net of powerful Rishis - every Avatara comes with his coterie of Rishis who =\r\nexplain the philosophy and spirituality of the Avatara to the general masse=\r\ns - who will then create new scriptures and Kalki will be looked at as the =\r\ncrest jewel of the Avataras.\n \n*  *   *\n \nI believe in the evolutionary par=\r\nable of these 9 Avatara because I find no other reason why these set of Ava=\r\ntara, from the whole list of possible Avataras, have captured the popular i=\r\nmagination. I mean Dattatreya is an Avatara too as per SB. His spirituality=\r\n is no less than that of any other Avatara. Yet, he is not in the list of 9=\r\n/10 Avataras. \n \nThe original Nath Yogis used to consider Nine Chakras in t=\r\nhe Human Body. The idea of Kundalini Yoga also came from them, which was ba=\r\nsically exploring cronologically all these nine chakras one after the other=\r\n by flooding them with Chit-Shakti.\n \nThere are 9 basic grahas in jyotish. =\r\nEach graha could very well represent the essential nature of each chakra. A=\r\nll these make me more sanguine that there must be Nine Evolutionary Avatara=\r\ns, not ten. In which case Kalki must be the Ninth Avatara.\n \nBuddha, as you=\r\n rightly pointed out, has a tremendous logical appeal in Kali Yuga. But if =\r\nlogic is the criteria, then why not Adi Shankara? I may not agree to his ph=\r\nilosophy as it comes down to us from his followers, but it cannot be denied=\r\n that Adi Shankara was arguable one of the sharpest and most logical of spi=\r\nritual philosphers. His intellectual and logical mind is beyond doubt. Just=\r\n that Shankara never claimed himself to be an Avatara. Neither did Siddhart=\r\nha. Only that the later came 3000 years ago, and the former came possibly i=\r\nn the last 1000 years. Shankara&#39;s spiritual impact on the world is no less =\r\nthan that of the Buddha. What mainstream Hinduism today is, could not have =\r\nbeen, had it not been for the invaluable contribution of Adi Shankara. And =\r\nif Buddha was truly the awaited 9th Avatara of Vishnu, Shankara would not h=\r\nave been able to absorb the philosophy of Buddha into Hinduism and thus mak=\r\ne it lose its grip on India. Buddhism barely exists in land of its birth.\n =\r\n\nAll this taken together, make me more and more convinced that there are 9 =\r\nevolutionary Avataras and the 9th is yet to come.\n \n*  *  *\n \nA little bit =\r\nabout Rama and Krshna. When I said I admire Rama, it is not a lip-service. =\r\nThere are incidents in the Ramayana which I find extremely inspiring, educa=\r\ntive and uplifting. Like the incident where Rama was to cross the ocean. Ra=\r\nma knew very well that if he wanted, in one moment he could have used his D=\r\nivine Astras and forced the ocean to yield way to his army. Yet he sat in s=\r\nilent supplication for days, praying that the ocean allow his army safe pas=\r\nsage. When all else failed, when genuine goodwill was not recirpocated, and=\r\n it was absolutely necessary to cross the ocean, THEN Rama took up weapons =\r\nto get the job done. A powerful warrior, who knows very well how powerful h=\r\ne himself is, not letting that sense of power pervert his mind even for a m=\r\noment is an amazing phenomenon. This kind of self-control is rare and worth=\r\ny of comtemplation, specially by anyone who feels, ever so slightly, that h=\r\ne/she has some form of power or influence in this world in any sphere. Rama=\r\n had no malice for anyone. Not even Ravana, by the end of the war at least.=\r\n He was the very personification of Satwa. In Satwa, conflict and malice an=\r\nd cunningness are impossible.\n \nRecently, a friend of mine told me that he =\r\nhas learnt all his life that one must listen to Krshna&#39;s advice, but only f=\r\nollow what Rama did, and not what Krshna did. I disagree with this vehement=\r\nly. If one reads entire Krshna&#39;s life with an objective mind, Krshna of Vrn=\r\ndavana, Krshna of Mathura, Krshna of Kurushetra, Krshna the Jagat Guru who =\r\nspeaks the Gita, one will find that what Krshna the Guru adviced in the Git=\r\na, Krshna the Divine Worker himself followed it all through his life at eve=\r\nry instance. It is his perfect detachment under all circumstances of life, =\r\nfrom childhood to his death, that makes me wonder, was this a man or was th=\r\nis a God? Can a man even do something like this? It is as if there is a par=\r\nt of Krshna who is always separate from everything, and silently watches th=\r\ne whole scene with a bemused smile. He had not a single personal stake in t=\r\nhe Mahabharata. Rama at least had his wife abducted for him to start a war =\r\nagainst Ravana. But Krshna had zero personal stake in the Mahabharata. Afte=\r\nr liberating his parents from Kamsa, very soon he went off to meet the Pand=\r\navas. From out of nowhere he forced himself into the politics of the Mahabh=\r\narata, and precipitated a great war to cleanse the world of burden. While L=\r\nakshmana devoutly followed Rama all along the Ramayana and they were like a=\r\nn inseparable pair, as Balarama in his next incarnation he could hardly und=\r\nerstand Krshna. There are so many occassions where Balarama asks Krshna, wh=\r\nat are they doing with all these kings, and that they should return to thei=\r\nr village in Vrndavana. Krshna merely smiles. He knows that not everyone wi=\r\nll understand everything. But that cannot stop him from following his dharm=\r\na, with perfect detachement from eveyrthing of this plane. Neither false pr=\r\naises, nor wrong accusations by his close people can affect him one bit. An=\r\nd I am not even counting the miracles he perfromed as a Divine Child. So I =\r\nworship Krshna, because I have not yet met or heard of read of a single sad=\r\nhaka or saint or ordinary man or mahatma who has displayed this kind of per=\r\nfected detachment through thick and thin, yet not withdrawing from the worl=\r\nd or actively performing a larger dharma.\n \nI started appreciating Swami Vi=\r\nvekanada more after I understood a bit of the Krshna Avatara. That was the =\r\nlast known saint who lived a whirlwind life in the middle of a circus-stopl=\r\night of fame and accusations, on one side adoring admirers and on the other=\r\n bitter enemies accusing him of being a heretic right upto the very end of =\r\nhis brief life, and yet none of that affected him to any great degree. He f=\r\naced terrific racism in the America, yet not a single speech of his reflect=\r\ns the slightest trace of bitterness, anger, or negativity. That is such a f=\r\nantastic achievement, IMHO.\n \nI agree with you, Narasimha, for most of us i=\r\nt is better to try to mould ones life with the same kind of supreme selfles=\r\nsness that Rama showed all along. Not just worship Rama but more importantl=\r\ny study his life and imbibe, to whatever degree possible, the quality he re=\r\npresented. Maybe, just maybe, then the Unmanifested Reality - Shiva - will =\r\nfix the mind so firmly on that Reality, that in some future life, in some l=\r\nater birth, one will be able to live life like Krshna showed, unattached an=\r\nd unaffected by any dirt that the world throws up. And then the Universal C=\r\nhit-Shakti (Adya Shakti) will flood such an individual with oppulence unima=\r\nginable, of this world and also of what lies in other worlds, like Krshna&#39;s=\r\n six oppulences - Infinite wealth, infinite beauty, infinite power/knowledg=\r\ne, infinite fame, and infinite detachment from all the other five. \n \n \nEnj=\r\noyed this discussion. :)\n \nJai Jai Rama Krshna Hari!\n \n-Regards\n Rajarshi\n =\r\n\nawaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah | param bhAwamajAnanto mamAw=\r\nyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n\nFrom: Narasimha P.V.R.

He too said there =\r\nare innumerable avataras. Avataras can come with a combination of paramatma=\r\nmsas (supreme/absolute being portions) and jivatmamsas (living/relative bei=\r\nng portions) taken from grahas in any combination. Though 9 main avataras o=\r\nf Vishnu came from paramatmamsas of 9 grahas, many many other avataras also=\r\n descended on earth due to various other combinations of paramatmamsas and =\r\njivatmamsas of the same 9 grahas! There are obviously many possibilities.\n =\r\n\nIn fact, Parasara says that ALL beings contain some paramatmamsa and some =\r\njivatmamsa, coming from grahas. But jivatmamsa is predominant in most of us=\r\n.\n \nWhen one leaves earth, paramatmamsas in one return to respective grahas=\r\n and jivatmamsas take birth again based on desires. In the &#39;end&#39;, even the =\r\njivatmamsas return to respective grahas. At the time of Mahapralaya, grahas=\r\n also merge back in Supreme Lord.\n \n*        *        *\n \nAs for Kalki, Par=\r\nasara did not clarify and we can only speculate. Though some people associa=\r\nte him with lagna, that makes no sense to me either. That is inconsistent w=\r\nith the overall framework laid by Parasara (i.e. beings born with combinati=\r\nons of paramatmamsas and jivatmamsas from *grahas*).\n \nKalki will probably =\r\ncome with paramatmamsas of both Sun and Moon. After all, Kalki shows Shiva =\r\nand Shakti (Sun and Moon - soul and mind) coming together finally!! Just a =\r\nspeculation..\n \n*        *        *\n \nWhether you take 9 or 10 or 22 avatar=\r\nas, the theory of evolutionary spiritual perfection does not add up because=\r\n &quot;perfection&quot; occurred before the last avatara, unless you break away from =\r\nmain scriptures and throw away Buddha (and discount Kalki as he has not com=\r\ne yet).\n \n*        *        *\n \nRather than &quot;evolution&quot;, it is a matter of =\r\nwhat the world needs at that time. If people at the beginning of Satya yuga=\r\n are established in Self always and the only issue is that a small attachme=\r\nnt may develop now and then, disturbing that state of being established in =\r\nSelf (i.e. stealing of Veda!), then the aspect of consciousness that is rel=\r\nevant is &quot;spirit of detachment&quot; (Ketu). If invoked, it removes that attachm=\r\nent and takes one back to being established in Self. So an avatara correspo=\r\nnding to Ketu occurred.\n \nAs collective consciousness became denser, being =\r\nestablished in Self became less natural and more effort was needed. So the =\r\n&quot;spirit of patience, persistence and hard-work&quot; (Saturn) became relevant an=\r\nd an avatara corresponding to Saturn occurred. And so on.\n \nIn the dark age=\r\ns of Kali yuga, rational minds wouldn&#39;t accept anything that didn&#39;t &quot;make s=\r\nense&quot;. Being established in Self became an unnatural, ridiculous and incomp=\r\nrehensible notion. So the &quot;spirit of comprehension&quot; (Mercury) became releva=\r\nnt. An avatara corresponding to Mercury occurred and tried to explain being=\r\n established in Self as a comprehensible notion, so that rational minds of =\r\nthat age would accept it to an extent and attempt it.\n \nAvataras occur base=\r\nd on the needs of collective consciousness. Of course, if one&#39;s consciousne=\r\nss is in a different state from the collective consciousness of that time, =\r\nthe current avatara may not be relevant to one.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; I=\r\n respect Rama, but I worship Krshna.\n \nI am awestruck by Krishna and worshi=\r\np him, but I see Rama as an ideal that I MAY be able to emulate oneday. In =\r\nfact, I recommend the approach to others.\n \nThough I said Rama and Krishna =\r\nare almost the same, there is a difference between soul and perfected mind.=\r\n Soul is a spark of Shiva and a perfected mind is a spark of Chit Shakti (w=\r\nhereas an imperfect mind is a spark of Maya shakti).\n \n\nBest regards,Narasi=\r\nmha--------Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.vedicastrologer.o=\r\nrg/\n--------\n \n\n\tFrom: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\n\tTo: &quot;vedic-=\r\nwisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n\tSent: Sunday, May =\r\n5, 2013 3:34 AM\n\tSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Comparing Dasavataras!\n\t\n\n=\r\n\t  \n\tDear Narasimha,\n\t \n\tJai Ma!\n\t\n\t\n\tJust to clarify, I may have a special=\r\n liking for Krshna, but my aim is obvious not to demean Rama, or any other =\r\nspecial form of God. Just clarifying incase someone gets the wrong impressi=\r\non. I respect Rama, but I worship Krshna.\n\t \n\t&lt;&lt;More importantly, if your u=\r\nnderstanding is correct, why isn&#39;t perfection occurring in the FINAL incarn=\r\nation but occurring well before?&gt;&gt;\n\t\n\tGood question!  \n\t \n\tThat is because,=\r\n SB is not concerned with the dasavatara. It lists 22 Avataras! It deals wi=\r\nth the idea of Avataran, but not with the idea of 9/10 fixed Avataras. It a=\r\nlso lists Varaha Avatara as the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya as the 10 in its li=\r\nst of 22. It is only in other puranas, that we get the focus on 10 Avatars,=\r\n and the term becomes popular. \n\t \n\tAnd ONLY when we take these 9/10 Avatar=\r\nas, in a fixed sequence of appearence, that we get the popular concept of D=\r\nasavatara. Else no. I find the evolutionary link in this concept of 9/10 Av=\r\nataras too compelling to be ignored.  \n\t \n\t&lt;&lt;After all, &quot;entire divinity&quot; c=\r\nannot be encapsulated by any form&gt;&gt;\n\t\n\t\n\tThis, I am in total agreement with=\r\n. Infact, in the 10th Chapter of Gita when the Supreme explains the various=\r\n vibhutis, this One is not even Krshna, but has transcended every limitatio=\r\nn of conception. Hence, the One says, among those who weild weapons, it is =\r\nRama, and among the Vrishnis it is Krshna! Etc..\n\t \n\t&lt;&lt;First, he IS mention=\r\ned in SB list of avataras as well as Parasara&#39;s list. If he does not &quot;fit&quot; =\r\nin your &quot;scheme of evolutionary Avatars&quot;, then your concept is possibly wro=\r\nng and avataras are perhaps not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theorize.&gt;&gt;\n\t\n\tAs I s=\r\naid, the SB list contains 22 Avataras. It does not focus on the idea of 9/1=\r\n0 Avataras! That is my point. If you take 22 Avataras, then these link to g=\r\nrahas are not of any use. For these nine grahas, individually or in combina=\r\ntion, will represent all Avataras, or for that matter everything else in th=\r\nis Universe.\n\t \n\tSecondly, if we take 10 Avatars and corresponding grahas f=\r\nor each, then what must Kalki be? Lagna? But lagna is not a graha.\n\t \n\tOr, =\r\njust surmising, can it be possible that until an Avatara actually descends =\r\non the earth, his energy and his force cannot be attributed to any graha, b=\r\nut once he does appear, it reconfigures things completely? We can only know=\r\n after the last Avatara comes.\n\t \n\tAnyway, I am not looking at this main Av=\r\natars from the point of grahas/jyotish at all. For that matter, some tradit=\r\nions consider Balarama to be an Avatara rather than Buddha.\n\t \n\t \n\tThe conc=\r\nept of Avatara and Vibhutis comes from the Gita. These two are slightly dif=\r\nferent. Avatara is a special descent of God, Paramatma, which appears on th=\r\nis world during times of severe crisis to cause a drastic and fundamental t=\r\nransition. A Vibhuti is a limited force of God which can appear to help out=\r\n, directly or indirectly, in any transition. A Vibuti need not be spiritual=\r\n. It could be in any field of work. Sometimes a Vibhuti may not even be awa=\r\nre of its purpose, unlike an Avatara.\n\t \n\tBasically, whenever we see excell=\r\nence in any form, in any field, it is always the energy of the One at work.=\r\n.\n\t \n\t-Regards\n\t Rajarshi\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tawaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddha=\r\nyah | \n\tparam bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n\n\tFrom: Narasimha=\r\n P.V.R.

More import=\r\nantly, if your understanding is correct, why isn&#39;t perfection occurring in =\r\nthe FINAL incarnation but occurring well before?\n\t \n\t*        *        *\n\t =\r\n\n\tFirst, regarding Krishna being a &quot;poornavatara&quot;, SrimadBhagavatam (SB) do=\r\nes not say that Rama is not one. In fact, Parasara, father of Vyasa, explic=\r\nitly mentioned that Rama, Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha are &quot;poornavataras&quot;=\r\n (used that exact expression) while other avataras have some amount of jiva=\r\ntmamsa too (though paramatmamsa dominates jivatmamsa).\n\t \n\tSecondly, after =\r\ndescribing the avataras, SB says that there are in fact innumerable avatara=\r\ns and that all rishis, munis, manus, demigods etc are avataras of Supreme L=\r\nord. It is under THAT context that 1.3.28 then proceeds to say &quot;these avata=\r\nras are partial, while Krishna is Lord Himself.&quot; I question if the deductio=\r\nn that Krishna *alone* is Lord Himself and Rama is not is accurate! It only=\r\n seems to say that all these rishis, manus, demigods etc are partial. As I =\r\nsaid above, Pararsara explicitly said that both Rama and Krishna are poorna=\r\nvataras.\n\t \n\tThird, let us ask a very fundamental question: What exactly do=\r\nes it mean if an avatara is &quot;Lord Himself&quot;?\n\t \n\t*        *        *\n\t \n\tWhi=\r\nle SB talks of Krishna being &quot;Lord Himself&quot; in 1.3.28, it also says in 1.3.=\r\n30: &quot;forms of Supreme Lord, who is in reality formless (arUpa) and of the n=\r\nature of pure consciousness (chidAtman), are manufactured by the qualities =\r\nof Maya&quot;. In the next verse, it further compares forms of Lord to clouds in=\r\n sky and dirt in air. Just as sky *contains* clouds and is beyond them, sim=\r\nilarly Lord *contains* forms and is beyond them. So, again, what is the mea=\r\nning of a specific form that descended on earth being &quot;Lord Himself&quot;? I am =\r\nafraid people may be misinterpreting this notion based on their fancies and=\r\n conditioning..\n\t \n\tAll beings are made up of paramatma (supreme/absolute b=\r\neing) and jivatma (living/relative being). The latter portion is dominant i=\r\nn us and is responsible for desires and rebirth. Great avataras descend fro=\r\nm a higher portion of paramatma. Very rarely avataras descend entirely from=\r\n paramatma without ANY jivatma portion. Rama and Krishna are specific examp=\r\nles given by Parasara.\n\t \n\tThey are entirely divine, but they do not encaps=\r\nulate the entire divinity!!!! After all, &quot;entire divinity&quot; cannot be encaps=\r\nulated by any form just as no cloud can contain the entire sky. They take p=\r\nart in the drama obeying and executing the divine will but NOT altering it.=\r\n This applies to Krishna as well as Rama.\n\t \n\t*        *        *\n\t \n\t&gt; Bud=\r\ndha was great spiritual force in this world. But I do not\n\t&gt; see him fit in=\r\n the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His\n\t&gt; realization, the one he advocat=\r\ned, is a static realization,\n\t&gt; an end in a void.\n\t \n\tFirst, he IS mentione=\r\nd in SB list of avataras as well as Parasara&#39;s list. If he does not &quot;fit&quot; i=\r\nn your &quot;scheme of evolutionary Avatars&quot;, then your concept is possibly wron=\r\ng and avataras are perhaps not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theorize.\n\t \n\tSecondly=\r\n, as per Parasara, Buddha corresponds to Mercury, who personifies logical m=\r\nind and the spirit of investigation and comprehension. Logical mind and its=\r\n spirit of comprehension are inherently fallible. Even a perfected spirit o=\r\nf comprehension is not capable of grasping the Absolute Reality completely,=\r\n for it is beyond comprehension. So, no wonder it simplifies the Incomprehe=\r\nnsible in an attempt to comprehend! That is what Buddha ended up doing. How=\r\never, logical mind has a great appeal in the Age of Reason in this Kali yug=\r\na. No wonder Buddha was/is/will be a great spiritual force in this world in=\r\n this age.\n\t \n\t*        *        *\n\t \n\tIf you dismiss Parasara&#39;s linking of=\r\n planets to avataras as a possible corruption, are you absolutely sure that=\r\n the verses of SB you are relying on are perfect? (In any case, it&#39;s a diff=\r\nerent matter that you are only taking some SB verses and ignoring some as I=\r\n showed!.)\n\t \n\tThe bottomline as far as I am concerned is that Pararsara&#39;s =\r\nlist actually makes amazingly coherent esoteric sense. The nature of each a=\r\nspect of consciousness (e.g. Buddha - spirit of comprehension, Saturn - spi=\r\nrit of patience & persistence, Venus - spirit of happiness etc) and the sto=\r\nry of corresponding avatara DOES have a highly meaningful connection, esote=\r\nrically speaking. After all, esoterically is how you really need to underst=\r\nand any higher scriptures and notions in them.\n\t \n\tIf we take scriptures li=\r\nterally instead and draw lopsided conclusions, some would conclude that Shi=\r\nva is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and other deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; some would conclu=\r\nde that Surya is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and other deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; and so=\r\n on.\n\t \n\t*        *        *\n\t \n\tOn a different note, someone may think tha=\r\nt Kali, being Aadyaa, is superior to Tara and like Kali more. But, some lea=\r\nrned yogis have declared them to be essentially the same and some scripture=\r\ns even prohibited differentiating between them. As I see it, the difference=\r\n between them is too subtle for even rishis to clearly comprehend. People s=\r\neeing some significant difference between them are, I am afraid, merely pro=\r\njecting their own conditioning. Same in the case of Krishna and Rama. Both =\r\nwere  perfectly detached and fully divine karma yogis.\n\t \n\tIf we think abou=\r\nt it, perfected mind (paramatma aspect represented by Moon) and soul (param=\r\natma aspect represented by Sun) are not really that different. So I am afra=\r\nid Krishna and Rama are not that different, though the specifics of their s=\r\ntories may be different.\n\t \n\tOne last word though. If someone truly believe=\r\ns that Krishna is superior to Rama and worships Krishna (or vice versa!), I=\r\n am very happy for such a person. My arguments are more for the sake of sha=\r\nring thinking/knowledge and pushing the boundaries of understanding in the =\r\nlong run, than changing the minds of anyone in the short run. In the end, e=\r\nveryone of us will have to go through one&#39;s own cycles of various tamasik, =\r\nrajasik and saattwik stages of evolution before one starts grasping some fi=\r\nstfuls of Reality.

Let=\r\n me write down as I see it, in point by point manner.\n\n\t\t1. In the Bhagwata=\r\n Purana, there are a list of 22 Avataras of Vishnu. In this list of 22, Var=\r\naha Avatara is the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya is the 10th Avatara. Dattatreya,=\r\n Nara-narayana,Vyasa Deva himself are in this list, and then the Bhagawata =\r\nPurana goes ontu mention that the Avatars of Vishnu are innumerable. In the=\r\n 10th Canto, Vyasa says all these Avatars, and innumerable others, are amsa=\r\ns of the Supreme Being while Krshna is &quot;swayam Bhagawan.&quot;\n\n\t\t2. Of these va=\r\nrious possible Avataras, 10, or rather 9 as I believe, are/have been accord=\r\ned special mention and significance across various Hindu spiritual literatu=\r\nre, specially those which were composed in the Kali-Yuga, namely the Purana=\r\ns.[When Krshna was alive, it was Kali-Sandhya, his physical presence had cu=\r\nrtailed the full effect of Kali,once he left his body, Kali started in full=\r\n flow. All Puranas were composed after this, hence these are scriptures of =\r\nthe Kali-Yuga, as are Tantras]\n\n\t\t3. These 10/9 Avataras have a fixed seque=\r\nnce of appearance. Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, R=\r\nama, Krshna, (Buddha) and Kalki. There is an unmistakeable connection of th=\r\ne form and sequence of these main avatars with the evolution of life on ear=\r\nth. From the aquatic, to the amphibian, to the land-animal, to the half-ani=\r\nmal-half-man, to the dwarf man (first human life form who immediately takes=\r\n possession of this earth represented by Vamana&#39;s 3 steps), to the Rajashik=\r\n avatara of Parashurama moving around with an axe, to the Sattwa Guna Avata=\r\nra of Rama, to the Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, this indicates that spi=\r\nrituality is not to be separated into another world, but is a progressive r=\r\nealization of the various manifestation and potentials that lie inherent in=\r\n the consciousness and its development through various life-forms. Larger s=\r\npirituality of earth and evolution go hand in hand. That is Nature&#39;s grand =\r\ndesign for life on earth.\n\n\t\t4. In this specifc context, I am only focusing=\r\n on the parable of these main 9/10 Avatars. It is not my contention that if=\r\n one worships say Matysa Avatara, one will not attain to a state of liberat=\r\nion of the soul. As is the nature of spiritual cosmology in Hinduism, any D=\r\nevata can lead a person to any depth of realization. And each one of the Av=\r\natars of Vishnu are self-realized in their own way and can be consider supe=\r\nr-massive spiritual dynamos.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t 5. Of these, naturally, Rama and K=\r\nrshna are most adored because they represent a stage of evolution, both ins=\r\nide as well as outside, which society can relate of much easier, in this ag=\r\ne. Rama represents, for me, the stage of most satwic mind. A satwic mind is=\r\n in control of itself. It known how to transform the animal tendencies with=\r\nin and without - monkeys - into a constructive force for a greater purpose.=\r\n However, as with a state of full Sattwa Guna, there can be instances, even=\r\n though few, of dejection. For it is static in nature and will change only =\r\nwhen circumstances force it to. As per the Valmiki Ramayana, Rama did feel =\r\ndejected while searching for Sita in the forest. He did have a moments fear=\r\n before the final assault on Ravana, which was dispelled by Agsatha when th=\r\ne later revealed the stotra of the Sun to Rama. At the end of the final bat=\r\ntle, Rama tells Sita, in a most dispassionate manner, that he killed Ravana=\r\n not to rescue her, but it was the Dharma to do so, and to unhold his famil=\r\ny honour. That too was the dharma of that age when he lived, family honor. =\r\nThe way I look at this grand epic, and I bow humbly to the genius of Rishis=\r\n Valmiki for representing the things as they are, as a scribe, as a poet, a=\r\ns an observer, and not adding his own preferences to it anywhere, in the 14=\r\n years of tribulation that Rama faced which culminated into his killing Rav=\r\nana, he changed into the most dispassionate leader, such that no personal c=\r\nonsideration or emotions or passions can overturn the Rajadharma. His life =\r\nis a lesson of what a true leader must be! Krshna, OTOH, had this immaculat=\r\ne detachment right from birth. I am not taking his  supernatural feats into=\r\n account. It is his singular and constant detachment from situations, from =\r\npeople, from environment, from circumstances that mark his life. At the age=\r\n of eight, he decides to leave Vrindavana for Mathura. All his friends, his=\r\n foster parents, his village-folks who so loved him, pleaded with him that =\r\nit would make no sense for him to leave the shelter, love and comfort of hi=\r\ns happy, settled village life and head into an unknown destiny and destinat=\r\nion. Krshna tried to reason with them, then he understood that they won&#39;t u=\r\nnderstand, he promised he will return back once his work in Mathura is over=\r\n. He never returned. Later, much later, when the Gopis came to him asking h=\r\nim to participate in their dance, he obliged. But the moment some of them s=\r\ntarted getting jealous and possessive of Krshna, he removed himself quietly=\r\n from the scene, saying that he belongs to everyone equally and no one has =\r\nany special right over him. When Shishupala abused Krshna, the later merely=\r\n kept dropping flowers on the floor, smiling and counting. The moment the 1=\r\n00th abuse was over, he swiftly cut off Shishupala&#39;s head and was back into=\r\n his poise. But when Bhurishrava unfairly accused Krshna of being a revolut=\r\nionist and charlatan, Krshna did not kill him. When Duryodhana, who used to=\r\n think of Krshna as another black magician, wanted to arrest him, Krshna sh=\r\nowed his vikarala roopa in the assembly of kings, yet he did not finish the=\r\n enemies off. The very next moment he was back into his own poised self. Ne=\r\nver in the whole Mahabharata is there one instance of his going overboard, =\r\nnever a single shade of depression, equivocation, or lack of confidence in =\r\nhis actions, irrespective of what others say or think of him. And then righ=\r\nt in the middle of the greatest war he had the perfect equipoise to deliver=\r\n the most sublime spiritual philosophy. That is why his life remains the be=\r\nst ideal of Karma-Yoga. For a true Karma-Yogi by definition can never be de=\r\njected. It is impossible. Neither the action nor the results belong to the =\r\ninstrument. When running away from the battle-field and killing Kaliya Yava=\r\nna, or when advising Bheema to tear apart Jarashanda, or gesturing Bheema t=\r\no hit Duryodhana below the waist, or getting Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krsh=\r\nna, as if by some Divine Intuition, knew exactly how the situations must be=\r\n lined up which would cause the destruction of these people. This kind of k=\r\nnowledge cannot come by the rational thinking. But happens when one is cons=\r\ntantly and consciously connected to the Universal Force. We do not find the=\r\nse kind of complex situations in the Rama Avatara, at least in the Valmiki =\r\nRamayana. Of course, if we take the Adhbut Ramayana or such other auxilliar=\r\ny texts and retelling, we get a different picture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana =\r\nwe have a 1000 headed demon attacking Rama after he kills Ravana, and then =\r\nSita turns into Adya Shakti and demolishes the 1000 headed demon and Rama w=\r\norships her. But if we take only the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the pict=\r\nure that emerges is very clear. Rama is the embodiment of Sattwic mind. The=\r\nrefore he displays all the great characteristics of satwa, chief of which i=\r\ns self-control, as well as the occasional sadness caused due to separation =\r\nfrom his wife Sita whom, at least until Ravana was destroyed, he loved very=\r\n dearly. Satwa guna creates a true saint, but can also cause some grief whe=\r\nn the stability is shaken. Krshna was gunatita. He had no attachment to any=\r\nthing in this world - man, women, deva, danava, friend, enemy - and therefo=\r\nre he was never affected any trace of negative emotion. His Ananda never le=\r\nft him even in the most trying situations. 6. Buddha was great spiritual fo=\r\nrce in this world. But I do not see him fit in the scheme of evolutionary A=\r\nvatars. His realization, the one he advocated, is a static realization, an =\r\nend in a void. This is clearly denying of the reality of this earth. I find=\r\n this not in tune with what either Rama or Krshna espoused. None of them ne=\r\ngated this world. If negation of this world and life is the final aim, then=\r\n why send so many avatars at crucial stages of evolutionary development? If=\r\n the spiritual impact on masses is the reason for Buddha being an Avatara, =\r\nthen why not Jesus or Zorathrusta.? They are no less impactful in that sens=\r\ne. But do they fit in the scheme of spiritual line that these 9 Avataras of=\r\n Narayana indicate in a most logical manner? No. As such many vaishnava tra=\r\nditions in parts of India, do not consider Buddha to be an avatara. Realiza=\r\ntion, to be complete and holistic, must be both static and dynamic, outside=\r\n of life as well as inside of life. That is why the Tantras formed their ow=\r\nn kind of spiritual philosophy, of the world as body of Shakti and therefor=\r\ne an object of reverence and realization. 7. The original literature of the=\r\n Nath Yogis used to mention 9 chakras. These are centers of psychological f=\r\nunctions. 6 inside the human body and 3 too subtle, or non-developed in mos=\r\nt people, even seekers. It is my belief that each of the 9 Avataras - exclu=\r\nding Buddha - correspond to the full power and force of one of these 9 Chak=\r\nras. Similarly, the 9 grahas, or that which can modify consciousness or all=\r\now the consciousness to explore and express itself is various possiblities,=\r\n are 9 in number. The lagna is a reference point and not a graha. Therefore=\r\n the chief Avatars who represent the parable of evolution are nine in numbe=\r\nr. And the ninth of the sequence is yet to come. 8. I cannot comment on whi=\r\nch graha would typically represent which Avatara. I know of what the BPHS s=\r\nays, however, it is my belief - feel free to disagree with it -:)[one canno=\r\nt rule out some deep-rooted corruption of understanding or textual misrepre=\r\nsentation in this Kali-Yuga] - that the Atmah among the Avataras has not ye=\r\nt appeared. It will be Kalki, or as Vimalananda seems to say in the Aghora =\r\nbooks, Nishkalanka - the stainless one. There is only one thing which is pe=\r\nrfectly stainless, the Atmah .After a Nirguna/Gunatita awastha comes living=\r\n in the full and complete purity and might and force and strength of the At=\r\nmah. By the sheer dint of his purity the last Avatara will burn away opposi=\r\nng forces of this world and fulfill the purpose of evolution. Even Krshna u=\r\nsed diplomacy at various points in his adult life to achieve his ends. Kalk=\r\ni, I am speculating, won&#39;t even need that. The white horse and that sword i=\r\ns a metaphor. He will be the only one capable enough to rectify the various=\r\n errors and corruptions that beset our age. Well, this is how I look at the=\r\n story of Avataras. It is perfectly ok not to agree with my views, but I am=\r\n reasonably sanguine now that this is what is closer to truth. -Regards  Ra=\r\njarshi\n\n\t\t\n\t\tawaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah | \n\t\tparam bhAwa=\r\nmajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n\n\t\tFrom: Narasimha P.V.R.

A learned friend wrote tha=\r\nt &quot;Krshna is the God-man&quot;, &quot;Previous Avatars are a build-up to this stage&quot; =\r\nand &quot;Buddha after Krshna is like going back from the linear progression of =\r\nspirituality that the Avatars manifest one after the other upto Krshna&quot;.   =\r\nI want to emphatically disagree with this notion that Dasavatars of a &quot;line=\r\nar progression of spirituality..upto Krshna&quot;.   *        *        *   Each =\r\navatara represents an aspect of Supreme in a perfected form.   Maharshi Par=\r\nasara equated dasavataras with planets. For example, Rama, Krishna and Nara=\r\nsimha are Sun, Moon and Mars, respectively.   We also know that Sun, Moon, =\r\nMars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are personifications o=\r\nf soul, mind, energy/initiative/drive, learning spirit, wisdom/discriminati=\r\non, spirit of enjoyment/being happy, patience/discipline, spirit of innovat=\r\nion/breaking barriers and detachment (respectively).   Correspondingly, eac=\r\nh avatara is an expression of that aspect of Supreme in a perfected form. E=\r\nach story is an example of how that aspect operates.   Lord Rama&#39;s story is=\r\n a perfected example of how soul operates. Lord Krishna&#39;s story is a perfec=\r\nted example of how mind operates. Lord Vamana&#39;s story is a perfected exampl=\r\ne of how wisdom/discrimination operates. Lord Narasimha&#39;s story is a perfec=\r\nted example of how energy/drive/initiative operates.   *        *        * =\r\n  Now, let us remember one basic thing. Soul in us, mind in us, energy in u=\r\ns, learning spirit in us, wisdom in us, happiness in us, discipline/patienc=\r\ne in us - all these are different manifestations of the same Self. However,=\r\n when Self manifests as these different aspects, it has different qualities=\r\n and plays different roles. There is no comparison between them.   We MAY f=\r\nocus on one aspect of us first, perfect it and then perfect other aspects t=\r\nhrough it. But, we need balance between all aspects in the end. Similarly, =\r\nthese different aspects of Supreme Being are incomparable and are in a bala=\r\nnce working together in the Cosmos.   *        *        *   One who is fasc=\r\ninated by the qualities of soul may like the story that demonstrates how so=\r\nul operates; one who is fascinated by the qualities of mind may like the st=\r\nory that demonstrates how mind operates, and one who is fascinated by the q=\r\nualities of wisdom may like the story that demonstrates how wisdom operates=\r\n. And so on. But this is just a matter of taste and subjective preference. =\r\n  *        *        *   Let us focus on Rama and Krishna, i.e. soul and min=\r\nd. Soul is seen as a representative of god in us, because of some basic att=\r\nributes of it. It is the higher self and has no agendas, no likes or dislik=\r\nes.   Once mind fancies a separate existence with some agendas/desires, sou=\r\nl supports the individualized consciousness stemming from that fancy and se=\r\nes it as its dharma. It lends strength and support to EVERY aspect of this =\r\nindividualized consciousness (e.g. mind, energy, intellect, learning abilit=\r\ny, enjoyment, discipline etc). It supports them fully and yet has no desire=\r\ns/agendas/likes/dislikes of its own! It impassionately witnesses and record=\r\ns all of one&#39;s agendas and karmas so that Laws of Nature give proper fruits=\r\n later on. It does all that despite full awareness that it is neither doing=\r\n those karmas nor receiving the fruits. As mind and other aspects of the in=\r\ndividualized consciousness entertain the notion that they are doing things =\r\nand begetting the fruits, soul supports them fully in this play. It sees th=\r\nat as its dharma and does it impassionately.   Now, does this sound excitin=\r\ng? Perhaps not to all. This functionality of an impassionate witness suppor=\r\nting the play, may not seem interesting enough to some.   On the other hand=\r\n, mind has likes, dislikes and agendas. It is constantly pursuing those age=\r\nndas, getting things and achieving things. Movement of mind is what keeps t=\r\nhe individualization going!!! Though soul is the support for everything els=\r\ne in the individualized consciousness, soul is a witness doing its dharma i=\r\nmpassionately. It is mind that keeps the individualization going and brings=\r\n in agendas and passion and even decides/affects every entity&#39;s dharma. Tha=\r\nt way, mind is really the &quot;boss&quot; of the individualization. No wonder Krishn=\r\na&#39;s life appeals more to one who may be excited by this description!   *   =\r\n     *        *   Lord Krishna is obviously awe-inspiring, but let me put R=\r\nama&#39;s life in perspective.   Rama&#39;s life demonstrates how soul operates. At=\r\n a young age, he received Brahma Jnana from Vasishtha and became realized. =\r\nYet, he did whatever was his &quot;dharma&quot;. He helped Vishwamitra. Soon after ma=\r\nrriage, he was given kingdom. At the last moment, his father banished him t=\r\no forest at the behest of his step-mother and his step-brother was given th=\r\ne throne. He had no complaints. Though his father, step-mother and step-bro=\r\nther felt guilty to various degrees, he himself supported and consoled all =\r\nthree and followed his dharma impassionately. Though he knew leaving Sita i=\r\nn the forest with Lakshmana and going after the golden deer would cause pro=\r\nblems, he did it impassionately when Sita insisted. When she was kidnapped =\r\nby Ravana, he searched for her and fought the battle. He never faulted Sita=\r\n for forcing him to leave her or faulted Lakshmana for leaving her later. H=\r\ne accepted every life situation with no complaints and did the best possibl=\r\ne action then. Even as he killed Ravana, he did so without hatred or anger,=\r\n but as his impassionate dharma. Even as Ravana was dying, he went to him a=\r\nnd respectfully learned some subjects that were going to disappear with Rav=\r\nana!   Rama is a perfect example of a liberated man with no desires or agen=\r\ndas who impassionately discharges one&#39;s dharma arising from the momentum of=\r\n karmas before liberation. THAT is basically what soul does!   *        *  =\r\n      *   As another example, let us look at Lord Vaamana. His story is a p=\r\nerfect demonstration of how wisdom/discrimination operates.   He was born a=\r\ns a learned pygmy. He filled the entire cosmos to rid earth of a charitable=\r\n demon king with many great qualities.   Wisdom/discrimination makes one hu=\r\nmble and unassuming. When one is doing good work but tainted with demonic q=\r\nualities (e.g. pride or attachment), one&#39;s discrimination is not pleased un=\r\ntil that pride is suppressed. When wisdom fills one&#39;s entire consciousness,=\r\n then demonic qualities are completely suppressed.   *        *        *   =\r\nPlease think about the other avataras. The stories can be understood as per=\r\nfect demonstrations of how various aspects of our consciousness operate, ba=\r\nsed on clues from Maharshi Parasara.   Let us not compare Dasavataras, but =\r\ncelebrate each of them separately. Of course, if you are more attracted to =\r\none of them, please think about that avatara more and develop devotion. The=\r\ny are ALL capable of relieving us from samsara.   *        *        *   By =\r\nthe way, happy Hanumajjayanti to those who celebrate it today (there are di=\r\nfferent schools of thought).
