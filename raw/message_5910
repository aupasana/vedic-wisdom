One point sur=\r\nprised me that, It is so flexible in calculating charts, I am confused, wha=\r\nt are the configuration settings that shall be correct for me. I wanted to =\r\ncreate chart for myself and my brothers. Our birth place being in orissa, I=\r\n want your help in letting me know the preference setting in Hora software =\r\nfor calculating charts for myself and my brothers. In other words which set=\r\ntings shall favour for creating chart for Orissa region.\n\nThanks and regard=\r\ns,\n\nSrinivas\n\n\n"}}
