Who is God? God is He who has transcended all that i=\r\ns seen by us. If\ntranscending this world, is there no relation between Him =\r\nand this world?\nNot a particle here is unrelated to Him. Then what is meant=\r\n by transcending\nthe world? The world comprises us and the objects seen by =\r\nus. In other\nwords, the animate and inanimate together form the world. What=\r\n shall we say\nof Him who created the beings and things? Of these two, we sa=\r\ny the conscious\nbeings to be superior. All that we can apprehend is that He=\r\n belongs to the\nhighest order of beings known to us. Our intellect cannot p=\r\nroceed further.\nThus, our Creator is superior to us; He cannot be apprehend=\r\ned by our\nintellect; therefore His Name, Transcended Being, &quot;Kadawul,&quot; mean=\r\ns that He\nsurpasses our intellect. Hence His Name is &quot;Kadawul&quot; - Transcende=\r\nd Being.\n\n2. Can God then not be made known to us? Not quite so. In a way, =\r\nHe is known\nto us. This much of His Grace is enough for us. We have no need=\r\n for all His\nGreatness. He has made known so much of His Greatness as will =\r\nsuffice to\neradicate our misery. There is no reason for Him to reveal a jot=\r\n more of His\nPower than is necessary to remedy our defects in the present s=\r\ntate. Thus He\nis known according to our needs. Nay, He is in our grasp. How=\r\never limitless,\nHe is within reach of our knowledge to some extent.\n\n3. Wha=\r\nt is it which brings Him within reach of our knowledge? That He is\nknown as=\r\n Being-Consciousness-Bliss.\n\nBeing denotes that which is imperishable, that=\r\n which exists forever. Should\nHe become nonexistent at any time, who is His=\r\n Destroyer? Who created Him?\nSince the perishable nature of all leads to th=\r\ne inference that they are\nlorded over by One who is imperishable, this immo=\r\nrtal Overlord is God. His\nimperishable nature is Being (Sat).\n\nNow, what is=\r\n Consciousness (Chit)? By Consciousness we mean knowledge. This\nis absolute=\r\n Knowledge, and not like our erring intellectual knowledge.\nIrregularity or=\r\n mistake cannot stain its actions. It is Knowledge, pure and\nsimple. Freque=\r\nntly He teaches us saying, &quot;Your knowledge is irregular and\nerring.&quot; How or=\r\nderly are even the insentient objects of His creation! It is\nknown to many =\r\nhow an atheist was taught a good lesson when he derided the\nscheme of thing=\r\ns saying, &quot;Why did He make the seed so small for the banyan\ntree which is s=\r\no big?&quot; That an insentient thing is found in good order and\nlater becomes u=\r\nseful, implies a conscious agency at work. Can a simple,\ninsentient thing d=\r\no something which is possible for unfailing knowledge\nonly? Or, can&#39;t it be=\r\n done by our inadequate knowledge? No, it can never be.\nTherefore God is sa=\r\nid to be Consciousness (Chit) also.\n\nNow, what is Bliss? It is the state of=\r\n being free from desire for anything.\nIt is Peace which is ever full. Were =\r\nHe to desire anything, how could He be\nbetter than ourselves? How could we =\r\ngain Bliss from Him? He Himself would\nrequire another being to fulfil His d=\r\nesires. But who would think Him to be\nso? The state of self-contentment is =\r\nthat of Bliss also. Therefore He is\ncalled Bliss (Ananda).\n\nThe three-Being=\r\n, Consciousness and Bliss-are inseparable; otherwise, they\nwould become nau=\r\nght individually. Hence, He is known as\nBeing-Consciousness-Bliss (Satchita=\r\nnanda). Thus God remains not only\ntranscendent but also falls within the re=\r\nach of our knowledge as\nBeing-Consciousness-Bliss.\n\n4. He who has gained th=\r\ne fourth state and sees all as one, only he knows God\ntruly as Being-Consci=\r\nousness-Bliss. Words cannot express nor the ears hear\nhow such a one is uni=\r\nted with God; it is a matter of realization. But there\nare ways and means f=\r\nor such realization. They can be spoken of, learned and\nacted upon.\n\n5. He =\r\nwho can be realized thus, is God. He has no name; we give Him a name.\nHe ha=\r\ns no form; we give Him a form. Where is the harm in doing so? What name\nis =\r\nnot His, or what form is not His? Where is the sound or form in which He\nis=\r\n not? Therefore, in the absence of true knowledge of Him you can name Him\na=\r\ns you please or imagine Him as of any form so to remember Him. Your hope\nfo=\r\nr His Grace without any effort on your part is utterly fruitless. Should\nit=\r\n be possible to have His Grace without any effort on your side, all would\nb=\r\ne alike; there would be no reason for any difference. He has shown us the\nw=\r\nays and means. Make effort, reach the goal, be happy. Your idleness and\nsel=\r\nfishness make you expect His Grace without your effort. The rule for all\nis=\r\n for you too. Do not relax your efforts. God can be realized by your\neffort=\r\n only.\n\n6. There is an effort which excels all others. This may, however, a=\r\nppear to\nbe less effective than devotion to God with name and form. Neverth=\r\neless,\nthis is the more efficient. It is simply the love which you extend t=\r\no all\nbeings, whether good or bad. In the absence of such love to all, your=\r\n\ndevotion to God amounts to a mere parody. Of what use are you to God? That=\r\n\nyou seek fulfilment of your desires from God without doing your duty towar=\r\nds\nthe needy in the world must be attributed to your selfishness. In God&#39;s\n=\r\npresence, there is no use for such. The workings that take place in His\npre=\r\nsence are all unselfish. Therefore, think that all the Centers are His\nand =\r\nHe is in all the Centers and thus be devoted to Him. God is truly bound\nby =\r\nsuch high devotion.\n\n7. As you go on ascribing names and forms to God and s=\r\nhowing love to all\nbecause you have understood all names and forms to be Hi=\r\ns, your mind will\ngradually mature. Just as the taste improves with the rip=\r\nening of a fruit,\nso also you will recognize the waxing of good and the wan=\r\ning of evil in you.\nAs your mind matures, there will come a time when you s=\r\nhould meet your\nMaster. This is not to say that you go in search of him or =\r\nhe comes in\nsearch of you. At the right time the meeting will happen. All a=\r\nre moving in\ntheir own ways. Your fitness brings you together, makes you tr=\r\nust him, makes\nhim teach you the right way, also makes you follow the his i=\r\nnstructions.\nThat is the straight way to reach God, which is to gain the fo=\r\nurth state.\nYou will follow the way and reach your goal which is\nBeing-Cons=\r\nciousness-Bliss, which is God.\n\n8. The way shown by the Master is final, st=\r\nraight and making for unity. It\nis well-tried, natural, and free from pain.=\r\n When you are following the way\nshown by the master, doubts will not arise;=\r\n there will be no fear. Are not\nfear and doubt the characteristics of the w=\r\nays of darkness? How can they\nmeet you in the way of Truth shown by the Mas=\r\nter? In this manner, the way\nwill itself speak to you and say that it is th=\r\ne right one. In that way,\nthere will be nothing more for you to do but to m=\r\neet your Master and learn\nfrom him. That way will be familiar to you, as th=\r\ne Master and God have made\nit so. Before you, he had treaded the way. He ha=\r\ns shown you the way and you\nare following him. To how many will you show th=\r\ne same way? And how many more\nwill follow the same way later? Obviously fea=\r\nr and doubt have no place in\nthe way of truth. When once you have taken a s=\r\ntep forward you will step\nback. The master&#39;s help is only for the first ste=\r\np forward. You need not do\nanything for your master in order to have the wa=\r\ny shown to you. Know him to\nbe the messenger of God sent down to disclose t=\r\nhe way to the fit who have\nbecome ripe by their own efforts in either or bo=\r\nth the directions mentioned\nearlier. It is God who sends this godly messeng=\r\ner just when you are ripe.\n\n9. Practice with faith in the period of ignoran=\r\nce is called Bhakti; the\nsame, with knowledge, is called Jnana. Of the two =\r\ndivisions of Bhakti, the\none is devotion to God with name and form, and the=\r\n other is karma which is\nlove for all. Of the two divisions of Jnana, the p=\r\nractice of the true way\nshown by the Master is called yoga and the resultin=\r\ng state is called Jnana.\nIt is natural for all to believe in something whic=\r\nh is not seen and then to\nfind it. Those who do not believe can never find.=\r\n Therefore, the believers\nwill gain something sometime or other and the unb=\r\nelievers never gain\nanything. You can believe even for the simple reason th=\r\nat faith in God is\nnot harmful. Thereby you can share the good effects. Thi=\r\ns world is meant\nonly for creating faith in you. This is the purpose of cre=\r\nation. Have faith\nand you can reach God.\n\n10. Though you may not believe al=\r\nl that is said of God, believe at least\n&quot;There is God.&quot; This seed is very p=\r\notent in its growth. It is so mighty as\nto negate all else and fill all by =\r\nitself. It is so almighty that you will\nnot see anything besides God, not e=\r\nven yourself. Truly, God is all.\n\nChapter IV - Peace\n\n1. What is peace? Alt=\r\nhough the world persists when a man is in deep sleep,\ndoes he have any care=\r\ns concerning it? His mind is tranquil and\nrefreshed. Should\nhis mind be in =\r\nthe same degree calm and refreshed even when he is face to\nface with the wo=\r\nrld and is active therein, then there is peace.\n\n2. Can the mind remain so =\r\neven when the world confronts us? It depends upon\nour estimate of the world=\r\n. The mind is more excited when one&#39;s own property\nis plundered than when a=\r\nnother&#39;s property is similarly plundered. Of one&#39;s\nown things, the loss of =\r\none thing causes greater concern than those of\nanother. Why? Because our es=\r\ntimate of the things is the cause of the degree\nof the delight or anxiety c=\r\noncerning them. Therefore, should one learn to\nregard all equally, the mind=\r\n will be extremely peaceful. Or should all\nthings be considered as our own =\r\nand highly prized, then too there is no\ncause for pain. Why? What will a ma=\r\nn regret? The mind which knows that\nuniversal concern is beyond its capacit=\r\ny, must needs become tranquil. Also\nwhen one feels that one has no claim on=\r\n anything or that everything is\nperishable, the mind will remain cool. Thus=\r\n there will be lasting peace if\none looks on all as of the same value. Peac=\r\ne is dependent upon one&#39;s\nintellectual appraisals.\n\n3. I shall now illustra=\r\nte this. A man wakes up from a dream. His mind is\nhappy or troubled accordi=\r\nng to his opinion of the things seen in the dream.\nBut on waking, his mind =\r\nremains unaffected by all the happenings in the\ndream; it remains the same.=\r\n Why? Because, only now his mind has learned to\nvalue all the matters of th=\r\ne dream equally. He is not sorry for the\ncessation of the dream. Why? He is=\r\n convinced that the dream is not\neverlasting and must end on waking. In the=\r\n same manner, should a man be\nconvinced that he cannot but wake up sometime=\r\n from the long dream of the\nworld, his mind will be unchanging. It is the s=\r\ntate of freshness. This is\nthe state of Peace.\n\n4. This is not to say that =\r\nhis relation with the world will cease. Now only\npeace and freshness of the=\r\n mind are his. His actions cannot but vary\naccording to circumstances. The =\r\nonly change in him after the mind has become\npeaceful is this: his mind has=\r\n known the truth and become unattached;\ntherefore, it rests in peace. His a=\r\nctions though changeful will always be\nimpartial. But the actions of others=\r\n are changing and cannot be impartial.\nThus, the coolness of the mind produ=\r\nces enormous good not only to himself\nbut also to the world at large. Peace=\r\n shows the way to right conduct.\n\n5. A man walks with a lighted lamp in his=\r\n hand. Can there be any hostility\nbetween the light and the ups and downs o=\r\nn the way? There cannot be. But\nlight and darkness cannot be together. The =\r\nlight chases away darkness, it\ndiscloses the ups and downs on the way and m=\r\nakes the man walk carefully,\nwhether he moves up, down, or sideways. It rem=\r\noves the cause of vain\ncomplaints, such as, &quot;That snag hurt my foot&quot; or &quot;Th=\r\nis hollow made me slip.&quot;\nSimilarly, after peace is gained, the state of pea=\r\nce makes the man neither\nhate nor antagonize the world. Rather it dispels t=\r\nhe darkness which conceals\nfrom our view the true nature of the world and i=\r\nts snags. In the absence of\nthe light of Peace which enables people to adju=\r\nst themselves to varying\ncircumstances, they condemn the world as full of m=\r\nisery, as they would\ncomplain of the snags on the road.Therefore a man who =\r\nhas gained the utmost\npeace after knowing the whole world as a complicated =\r\ndream, should not be\nconsidered either unrelated to the world or unconcerne=\r\nd with its activities;\nhe alone stands in effective concord with it; only h=\r\ne is competent to be a\nman of action. Thus Peace is that which regulates on=\r\ne&#39;s duties.\n\n6. The concern of a man of Peace in the actions of the world l=\r\nies in\nrectifying them. Should he feel fear before this world, what hope of=\r\n\nreformation can there be, especially from those who esteem it and want to\n=\r\npossess it? They are in the grip of selfishness, blind to impartiality. To\n=\r\nguide the blind on the way or treat the blindness of the eye, one&#39;s eyesigh=\r\nt\nmust itself be good. Similarly, it is for him to reform the world who has=\r\n\nalready discerned his unchanging nature from the changeful nature of the\nw=\r\norld and become peaceful. These cannot help serving the world. Why? Can\nany=\r\none be so hard hearted as not to lift up a child when it slips and falls?\nS=\r\no also for the wise ones who can rightly appraise the troubles of the world=\r\n\nand help the people. Because he has already withdrawn himself from the min=\r\nd\nand body the sage feels no concern under the strain of service to the wor=\r\nld,\njust as the life principle does not suffer even when loaded carts pass =\r\nover\nthe corpse it has left behind (by itself). He will not shrink from wor=\r\nk or\ntrouble. Only truly realized peace can bestow such courage and coolnes=\r\ns.\n\n7. To all appearances. Peace will look poor and quite weak. But in effe=\r\nct,\nit beats all. In tenacity and courage, it surpasses all. After all, suc=\r\ncess\ndepends on these qualities. Even if Mount Meru should topple over, the=\r\n\nincident will hardly produce a gentle smile in the man of peace, or it wil=\r\nl\nleave him unmoved. This state is helpful both for worldly and spiritual\nm=\r\natters. True happiness in the world is his, and that happiness comes out of=\r\n\nrelease from bondage. Peace means doing good to any one in any manner.\n\n8.=\r\n The obstacles to peace are several. They are meant to prove the man. When\n=\r\nthey confront us we should be wide awake and keep the delicate flower of th=\r\ne\nmind distant from even their shadows. If the flower of the mind be crushe=\r\nd,\nit will lose its fragrance, freshness and color; it will neither be usef=\r\nul\nto you, nor can it be presented to others, nor offered to God. Know that=\r\n\nyour mind is more delicate than even a blossom. By means of a peaceful min=\r\nd,\nall your duties to yourself, to others and to God must be discharged. Le=\r\nt it\nrelease the same freshness throughout. All blessings for the mind are\n=\r\ncontained in Peace.\n\n9. Unremittingly worship the God of your Self with the=\r\n flower of your mind.\nLet the children of the mental modes watch this worsh=\r\nip. Gradually they will\nlearn to cast away their childish pranks and desire=\r\n to delight like\nyourself. As they watch your Peace, they will themselves r=\r\necoil from their\nvagaries. Continue the worship patiently. Be not led away =\r\nby the vagaries of\nthe mind. On the contrary, they should become peaceful b=\r\ny your peace. All\nmust get peace.\n\n10. I shall finish in one word: The esse=\r\nnce of all the Vedas is &quot;Peace.&quot;\n\nSource: http://www.arunachala.org/newslet=\r\nters/1998/?pg=3Dnov-dec\n\n...

If transcending this world, is=\r\n there no relation between Him and this world? Not a particle here is unrel=\r\nated to Him. Then what is meant by transcending the world? The world compri=\r\nses us and the objects seen by us. In other words, the animate and inanimat=\r\ne together form the world. What shall we say of Him who created the beings =\r\nand things? Of these two, we say the conscious beings to be superior.=C2=A0=\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;All that we can apprehend is that He belon=\r\ngs to the highest order of beings known to us. Our intellect cannot proceed=\r\n further. Thus, our Creator is superior to us; He cannot be apprehended by =\r\nour intellect;&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0therefore His Name, Transcended Being, &quot;Kad=\r\nawul,&quot; means that He surpasses our intellect. Hence His Name is &quot;=\r\nKadawul&quot; - Transcended Being.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;2. Can God then not be made kno=\r\nwn to us? Not quite so. In a way, He is known to us. This much of His Grace=\r\n is enough for us. We have no need for all His Greatness. He has made known=\r\n so much of His Greatness as will suffice to eradicate our misery. There is=\r\n no reason for Him to reveal a jot more of His Power than is necessary to r=\r\nemedy our defects in the present state. Thus He is known according to our n=\r\needs. Nay, He is in our grasp. However limitless, He is within reach of our=\r\n knowledge to some extent.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;3. What is it which brings Him within r=\r\neach of our knowledge? That He is known as Being-Consciousness-Bliss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;Being denotes that which is imperishable, that which exists forever. Shou=\r\nld He become nonexistent at any time, who is His Destroyer? Who created Him=\r\n? Since the perishable nature of all leads to the inference that they are l=\r\norded over by One who is imperishable, this immortal Overlord is God. His i=\r\nmperishable nature is Being (Sat).&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold=\r\n&quot;&gt;Now, what is Consciousness (Chit)? By Consciousness we mean knowledge.&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;=C2=A0This is absolute Knowledge, and not like our erring intellectual =\r\nknowledge. Irregularity or mistake cannot stain its actions. It is Knowledg=\r\ne, pure and simple. Frequently He teaches us saying, &quot;Your knowledge i=\r\ns irregular and erring.&quot; How orderly are even the insentient objects o=\r\nf His creation! It is known to many how an atheist was taught a good lesson=\r\n when he derided the scheme of things saying, &quot;Why did He make the see=\r\nd so small for the banyan tree which is so big?&quot; That an insentient th=\r\ning is found in good order and later becomes useful, implies a conscious ag=\r\nency at work. Can a simple, insentient thing do something which is possible=\r\n for unfailing knowledge only? Or, can&#39;t it be done by our inadequate k=\r\nnowledge? No, it can never be. Therefore God is said to be Consciousness (C=\r\nhit) also.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Now, what is Bliss? It=\r\n is the state of being free from desire for anything. It is Peace which is =\r\never full.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0Were He to desire anything, how could He be better t=\r\nhan ourselves? How could we gain Bliss from Him? He Himself would require a=\r\nnother being to fulfil His desires. But who would think Him to be so? The s=\r\ntate of self-contentment is that of Bliss also. Therefore He is called Blis=\r\ns (Ananda).&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The three-Being, Consciousness and Bliss-are inseparab=\r\nle; otherwise, they would become naught individually. Hence, He is known as=\r\n Being-Consciousness-Bliss (Satchitananda). Thus God remains not only trans=\r\ncendent but also falls within the reach of our knowledge as Being-Conscious=\r\nness-Bliss.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;4. He who has gained the fourth state and sees all as =\r\none, only he knows God truly as Being-Consciousness-Bliss. Words cannot exp=\r\nress nor the ears hear how such a one is united with God; it is a matter of=\r\n realization. But there are ways and means for such realization. They can b=\r\ne spoken of, learned and acted upon.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;5. He who can be realized thu=\r\ns, is God. He has no name; we give Him a name. He has no form; we give Him =\r\na form. Where is the harm in doing so? What name is not His, or what form i=\r\ns not His? Where is the sound or form in which He is not? Therefore, in the=\r\n absence of true knowledge of Him you can name Him as you please or imagine=\r\n Him as of any form so to remember Him. Your hope for His Grace without any=\r\n effort on your part is utterly fruitless. Should it be possible to have Hi=\r\ns Grace without any effort on your side, all would be alike; there would be=\r\n no reason for any difference. He has shown us the ways and means. Make eff=\r\nort, reach the goal, be happy. Your idleness and selfishness make you expec=\r\nt His Grace without your effort. The rule for all is for you too. Do not re=\r\nlax your efforts. God can be realized by your effort only.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;6. Ther=\r\ne is an effort which excels all others. This may, however, appear to be les=\r\ns effective than devotion to God with name and form. Nevertheless, this is =\r\nthe more efficient. It is simply the love which you extend to all beings, w=\r\nhether good or bad. In the absence of such love to all, your devotion to Go=\r\nd amounts to a mere parody. Of what use are you to God? That you seek fulfi=\r\nlment of your desires from God without doing your duty towards the needy in=\r\n the world must be attributed to your selfishness. In God&#39;s presence, t=\r\nhere is no use for such. The workings that take place in His presence are a=\r\nll unselfish. Therefore, think that all the Centers are His and He is in al=\r\nl the Centers and thus be devoted to Him. God is truly bound by such high d=\r\nevotion.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;7. As you go on ascribing names and forms to God and show=\r\ning love to all because you have understood all names and forms to be His, =\r\nyour mind will gradually mature. Just as the taste improves with the ripeni=\r\nng of a fruit, so also you will recognize the waxing of good and the waning=\r\n of evil in you. As your mind matures, there will come a time when you shou=\r\nld meet your Master. This is not to say that you go in search of him or he =\r\ncomes in search of you. At the right time the meeting will happen. All are =\r\nmoving in their own ways. Your fitness brings you together, makes you trust=\r\n him, makes him teach you the right way, also makes you follow the his inst=\r\nructions. That is the straight way to reach God, which is to gain the fourt=\r\nh state. You will follow the way and reach your goal which is Being-Conscio=\r\nusness-Bliss, which is God.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;8. The way shown by the Master is fina=\r\nl, straight and making for unity. It is well-tried, natural, and free from =\r\npain. When you are following the way shown by the master, doubts will not a=\r\nrise; there will be no fear. Are not fear and doubt the characteristics of =\r\nthe ways of darkness? How can they meet you in the way of Truth shown by th=\r\ne Master? In this manner, the way will itself speak to you and say that it =\r\nis the right one. In that way, there will be nothing more for you to do but=\r\n to meet your Master and learn from him. That way will be familiar to you, =\r\nas the Master and God have made it so. Before you, he had treaded the way. =\r\nHe has shown you the way and you are following him. To how many will you sh=\r\now the same way? And how many more will follow the same way later? Obviousl=\r\ny fear and doubt have no place in the way of truth. When once you have take=\r\nn a step forward you will step back. The master&#39;s help is only for the =\r\nfirst step forward. You need not do anything for your master in order to ha=\r\nve the way shown to you. Know him to be the messenger of God sent down to d=\r\nisclose the way to the fit who have become ripe by their own efforts in eit=\r\nher or both the directions mentioned earlier. It is God who sends this godl=\r\ny messenger just when you are ripe.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;9. Practice with faith in the =\r\nperiod of ignorance is called Bhakti; the same, with knowledge, is called J=\r\nnana. Of the two divisions of Bhakti, the one is devotion to God with name =\r\nand form, and the other is karma which is love for all. Of the two division=\r\ns of Jnana, the practice of the true way shown by the Master is called yoga=\r\n and the resulting state is called Jnana. It is natural for all to believe =\r\nin something which is not seen and then to find it. Those who do not believ=\r\ne can never find. Therefore, the believers will gain something sometime or =\r\nother and the unbelievers never gain anything. You can believe even for the=\r\n simple reason that faith in God is not harmful. Thereby you can share the =\r\ngood effects.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;This world is meant onl=\r\ny for creating faith in you. This is the purpose of creation. Have faith an=\r\nd you can reach God.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;10. Though you may not believe all tha=\r\nt is said of God, believe at least &quot;There is God.&quot; This seed is v=\r\nery potent in its growth. It is so mighty as to negate all else and fill al=\r\nl by itself. It is so almighty that you will not see anything besides God, =\r\nnot even yourself. Truly, God is all.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:b=\r\nold&quot;&gt;Chapter IV - Peace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bo=\r\nld&quot;&gt;What is peace? Although the world persists when a man is in deep sleep,=\r\n does he have any cares concerning it? His mind is tranquil and refreshed.&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;=C2=A0Should his mind be in the same degree calm and refreshed even w=\r\nhen he is face to face with the world and is active therein, then there is =\r\npeace.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;2. Can the mind remain so even when the world confronts us?=\r\n It depends upon our estimate of the world. The mind is more excited when o=\r\nne&#39;s own property is plundered than when another&#39;s property is simi=\r\nlarly plundered. Of one&#39;s own things, the loss of one thing causes grea=\r\nter concern than those of another. Why? Because our estimate of the things =\r\nis the cause of the degree of the delight or anxiety concerning them. There=\r\nfore, should one learn to regard all equally, the mind will be extremely pe=\r\naceful. Or should all things be considered as our own and highly prized, th=\r\nen too there is no cause for pain. Why? What will a man regret?=C2=A0&lt;span =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The mind which knows that universal concern is b=\r\neyond its capacity, must needs become tranquil. Also when one feels that on=\r\ne has no claim on anything or that everything is perishable, the mind will =\r\nremain cool.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0Thus there will be lasting peace if one looks on a=\r\nll as of the same value. Peace is dependent upon one&#39;s intellectual app=\r\nraisals.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;3. I shall now illustra=\r\nte this. A man wakes up from a dream. His mind is happy or troubled accordi=\r\nng to his opinion of the things seen in the dream. But on waking, his mind =\r\nremains unaffected by all the happenings in the dream; it remains the same.=\r\n Why? Because, only now his mind has learned to value all the matters of th=\r\ne dream equally. He is not sorry for the cessation of the dream. Why? He is=\r\n convinced that the dream is not everlasting and must end on waking. In the=\r\n same manner, should a man be convinced that he cannot but wake up sometime=\r\n from the long dream of the world, his mind will be unchanging. It is the s=\r\ntate of freshness. This is the state of Peace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;4. This is n=\r\not to say that his relation with the world will cease. Now only peace and f=\r\nreshness of the mind are his. His actions cannot but vary according to circ=\r\numstances.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The only change in him aft=\r\ner the mind has become peaceful is this: his mind has known the truth and b=\r\necome unattached; therefore, it rests in peace. His actions though changefu=\r\nl will always be impartial.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0But the actions of others are chang=\r\ning and cannot be impartial. Thus, the coolness of the mind produces enormo=\r\nus good not only to himself but also to the world at large. Peace shows the=\r\n way to right conduct.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;5. A man walks with a lighted lamp in his h=\r\nand. Can there be any hostility between the light and the ups and downs on =\r\nthe way? There cannot be. But light and darkness cannot be together. The li=\r\nght chases away darkness, it discloses the ups and downs on the way and mak=\r\nes the man walk carefully, whether he moves up, down, or sideways. It remov=\r\nes the cause of vain complaints, such as, &quot;That snag hurt my foot&quot=\r\n; or &quot;This hollow made me slip.&quot; Similarly, after peace is gained=\r\n, the state of peace makes the man neither hate nor antagonize the world. R=\r\nather it dispels the darkness which conceals from our view the true nature =\r\nof the world and its snags. In the absence of the light of Peace which enab=\r\nles people to adjust themselves to varying circumstances, they condemn the =\r\nworld as full of misery, as they would complain of the snags on the road.&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Therefore a man who has gained the utmost pe=\r\nace after knowing the whole world as a complicated dream, should not be con=\r\nsidered either unrelated to the world or unconcerned with its activities; h=\r\ne alone stands in effective concord with it; only he is competent to be a m=\r\nan of action. Thus Peace is that which regulates one&#39;s duties.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;6. The concern of a man of Peace in the actions of the world lies i=\r\nn rectifying them. Should he feel fear before this world, what hope of refo=\r\nrmation can there be, especially from those who esteem it and want to posse=\r\nss it? They are in the grip of selfishness, blind to impartiality. To guide=\r\n the blind on the way or treat the blindness of the eye, one&#39;s eyesight=\r\n must itself be good. Similarly, it is for him to reform the world who has =\r\nalready discerned his unchanging nature from the changeful nature of the wo=\r\nrld and become peaceful. These cannot help serving the world. Why? Can anyo=\r\nne be so hard hearted as not to lift up a child when it slips and falls? So=\r\n also for the wise ones who can rightly appraise the troubles of the world =\r\nand help the people. Because he has already withdrawn himself from the mind=\r\n and body the sage feels no concern under the strain of service to the worl=\r\nd, just as the life principle does not suffer even when loaded carts pass o=\r\nver the corpse it has left behind (by itself). He will not shrink from work=\r\n or trouble. Only truly realized peace can bestow such courage and coolness=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;7. To all appearances. Peace will look poor and quite weak. But =\r\nin effect, it beats all. In tenacity and courage, it surpasses all. After a=\r\nll, success depends on these qualities. Even if Mount Meru should topple ov=\r\ner, the incident will hardly produce a gentle smile in the man of peace, or=\r\n it will leave him unmoved. This state is helpful both for worldly and spir=\r\nitual matters.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;True happiness in the =\r\nworld is his, and that happiness comes out of release from bondage. Peace m=\r\neans doing good to any one in any manner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;8. The obstacles =\r\nto peace are several. They are meant to prove the man. When they confront u=\r\ns we should be wide awake and keep the delicate flower of the mind distant =\r\nfrom even their shadows. If the flower of the mind be crushed, it will lose=\r\n its fragrance, freshness and color; it will neither be useful to you, nor =\r\ncan it be presented to others, nor offered to God. Know that your mind is m=\r\nore delicate than even a blossom. By means of a peaceful mind, all your dut=\r\nies to yourself, to others and to God must be discharged. Let it release th=\r\ne same freshness throughout. All blessings for the mind are contained in Pe=\r\nace.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;9. Unremittingly worship the God of your Self with the flower=\r\n of your mind. Let the children of the mental modes watch this worship. Gra=\r\ndually they will learn to cast away their childish pranks and desire to del=\r\night like yourself. As they watch your Peace, they will themselves recoil f=\r\nrom their vagaries. Continue the worship patiently. Be not led away by the =\r\nvagaries of the mind. On the contrary, they should become peaceful by your =\r\npeace. All must get peace.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;10. I shall finish in one word:=C2=A0&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The essence of all the Vedas is &quot;Peace.=\r\n&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/1998/?pg=3Dnov-dec&quot; target=3D&quot;_b=\r\nlank&quot;&gt;http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/1998/?pg=3Dnov-dec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;clear:both;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin=\r\n-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, =\r\n51);font-size:87%;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;marg=\r\nin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;...
