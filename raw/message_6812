In the beginning, one may start with blind faith,=\r\n but \neventually one has to know by experience. Otherwise, it is not of muc=\r\nh \nuse. The problem in the world right now is that there are many relgions =\r\n\nled by people who have not experienced god in any manner and yet leading \n=\r\npeople. This has resulted in people fighting and killing in the name of \ngo=\r\nd.\n\n* * *\n\nAnyway, coming back to your question, I did not say planetary ka=\r\nvachas \nare a much. In fact, I said Chandi kavacham and Narayana kavacham a=\r\nre \nbetter for most people. In fact, any prayer can protect one, if one doe=\r\ns \nwith enough intensity for enough duration.\n\n* * *\n\nI never said or will =\r\nsay that doing a particular ritual or mantra is the \nonly way to solve a pa=\r\nrticular problem or to experience a particular \naspect of god. Just as one =\r\ncan reach a mountain top from various sides \nusing various paths, one can r=\r\neach god using various paths. God is not \nelsewhere, but within us. But, th=\r\ne conditioning accumulated thru many \nlives makes us look at things with at=\r\ntraction and aversion and mind \nvibrates with attraction, aversion, pride, =\r\nshame, anger, jealosy etc. If \nmind becomes nearly still, one can be in bli=\r\nss and the divine energy \nwithin expresses outside. The goal of various rel=\r\ngions is to take the \nmind to that state.\n\nThere are many ways to facilitat=\r\ne that. Chanting a sacred combinations \nof syllables with a focused mind is=\r\n one way. In my opinion, one can \nachieve one-pointedness of mind with any =\r\nsyllable combination. Mind \nachieving one-pointedness with any mantra and/o=\r\nr mental imagery is a \ngood thing. But depending the mantra/imagery, a diff=\r\nerent kind of energy \nenvelopes that focused mind, purifies it and affects =\r\nit. It just so \nhappens that many great realized yogis came on the blessed =\r\nland of India \nand cataloged many mantras and imagery. In other religions a=\r\nlso, many \npeople have experienced one-pointedness of mind on a \nthought/im=\r\nagery/sound combination and experienced divinity. A muslim can \ntake a sura=\r\nh from Quran and meditate with it. In fact, some sufi saints \ndid experienc=\r\ne divinity like that. Also, there are paths other than \nmeditation. Serving=\r\n others and trying to see god in all is a valid path \ntoo. Oneday, mind can=\r\n experience god that way too.\n\nWhile other areas of the world had their sha=\r\nre of realized souls, India \nhad just too many of them. What is known today=\r\n as Hinduism has a rich \nlibrary of knowledge from their experiences and re=\r\nvelations. One can try \na path that was traversed by others and is well-und=\r\nerstood. It does not \nmean those on the other side of the mountain are doom=\r\ned.\n\n* * *\n\n&gt; doing homams or not doing homams or any other hindu worship m=\r\nethod\n\nJapam and homam are not the monopoly of any religion and not just &quot;H=\r\nindu \nworship methods&quot;. People who meditated with special chants and \nexper=\r\nienced ecstasy, bliss and inner divinity came in every part of the \nworld a=\r\nnd in every religion.\n\nAs for homam, sacredness of fire and the ability to =\r\nconnect to the \ndivine faster when using fire, was known to many religions.=\r\n Not only \nHindus, but native Americans worshipped god in fire, Zoroastrian=\r\ns did \nit, ancient Greco-Romans did it, some Buddhists did it, some south \n=\r\nAmericans did it, some Scandinavians did it, and so on. There are \nreferenc=\r\nes in Bible of even Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Moses having \nworshippe=\r\nd god in fire. For example, GENESIS 8:20 says &quot;And Noah builded \nan altar u=\r\nnto the Lord; and took of every clean beast, and of every \nclean fowl, and =\r\noffered burnt offerings on the altar&quot;. The Korban Olah \n(&quot;whole offering&quot;) =\r\nof Judaism, where a whole animal was burnt in fire, \nis very similar to &quot;po=\r\nornaahuti&quot; (whole offering) of homam where a full \ncoconut symbolizing head=\r\n or ego is burnt in fire. The seven candles of \nminorah, an integral part o=\r\nf judaism, remind us of the seven tongues of \nAgni.\n\nNew Testament refers t=\r\no baptism with fire (baptism is purification by \nsprinkling or dipping in h=\r\noly water). John the Baptist says, &quot;I indeed \nbaptize you with water unto r=\r\nepentance, but He who is coming after me is \nmightier than I =E2=80=93 He w=\r\nill baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.&quot; \n(MATTHEW 3:11). Purificati=\r\non with fire is superior to purification with \nwater. Note that fire is clu=\r\nbbed with Holy Spirit here. In Veda also, \nfire is used as a symbol of Self=\r\n.\n\nMany seekers in many religions achieved the ascension of individual \ncon=\r\nsciousness into cosmic consciousness using the medium of fire. With \nadvanc=\r\ning Kali yuga, knowledge has given way to ignorance in many \nreligions and =\r\nnow finally in Hinduism too! However, a Satya yuga like \nsub-period within =\r\nKali yuga is coming again.\n\nBTW, the under construction website http://Fire=\r\nYoga.net has some more \ninformation along these lines.\n\nBest regards,\nNaras=\r\nimha\n----------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotis=\r\nh Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual=\r\n manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n=\r\nFilms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\nSpirituality: http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/JyotishWritings\nTwitter ID: @homam108\n--------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------\n\n--- In JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com, Venk=\r\nat Rao &lt;mail2venkyrao@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Pranaam Narasimhaji,\n&gt;\n&gt; In this wor=\r\nld,population of Hindus are less compared to Muslims and \n&gt; there are peopl=\r\ne following different religion.Most of the other \n&gt; religion do not incorpo=\r\nrate worshipping planets - be it with -sincere \n&gt; worship or insincere wors=\r\nhip or doing homams or not doing homams or \n&gt; any other hindu worship metho=\r\nd.If that is the case how do we see \n&gt; planets protecting them.Please do no=\r\nt answer this with answers like \n&gt; &quot;faith&quot; or &quot;fate&quot; as they are nothing bu=\r\nt excuses since your mail \n&gt; below claims to be very scientific and result =\r\noriented for performed \n&gt; actions.\n&gt;\n&gt; Eg-\n&gt;\n&gt; If one chants a kavacha 10-3=\r\n0 times everyday and does it for 40-60 \n&gt; days, then some kind of results c=\r\nan be expected.

Kavachas of various deities (or \n&gt; p=\r\nlanets) are protective sheaths covering one&#39;s consciousness and \n&gt; stopping=\r\n harmful influences.\n&gt;\n&gt; Grahas (literal meaning: those who grasp or get ho=\r\nld of) give good and \n&gt; bad results by grasping one&#39;s consciousness and aff=\r\necting it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Each planet has positives and negatives, in general and also=\r\n based on \n&gt; the chart. If one chants the kavacha of a planet many times, \n=\r\n&gt; eventually a protective sheath is formed around one&#39;s consciousness \n&gt; wi=\r\nth the nature and energy of that planet. This will obviously offer \n&gt; prote=\r\nction that is consistent with the nature of that planet, in \n&gt; general and =\r\nin one&#39;s chart. But, please remember that reading the \n&gt; kavacha of any pla=\r\nnet will NOT harm you. Even the kavacha of 8th lord \n&gt; or 6th lord will not=\r\n harm one.\n&gt;\n&gt; Suppose one has Pi lagna. If he chants Sukra kavacha, Venus =\r\nwill \n&gt; protect one from loss of courage (3rd), problems to shoulders (3rd)=\r\n, \n&gt; untimely death (i.e. loss of longevity/8th), problems in anus/genital =\r\n\n&gt; area (8th) etc. There may be other things based on other factors like \n&gt;=\r\n aspects, occupancy etc. Based on his inherent nature, Venus may also \n&gt; pr=\r\notect in the matters of love, romance, creativity etc also. \n&gt; Bottomline i=\r\ns that the aspects of one&#39;s personality that the planet is \n&gt; conducive to =\r\nwill be protected by the planet&#39;s energy.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you pick a wrong planet, y=\r\nou may not get the desired result, but no \n&gt; harm is done. Even bad planets=\r\n in your chart will have some aspects \n&gt; they want to protect and doing the=\r\nir kavacha will protect those \n&gt; aspects.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best will be to chant the kav=\r\nachas of lagna lord, dispositor of lagna \n&gt; lord, Moon&#39;s dispositor and Sun=\r\n&#39;s dispositor. Even better will be to \n&gt; chant the kavachas of devatas inst=\r\nead of planets. Out of all the \n&gt; kavachas I have seen until now, Narayana =\r\nkavacha (from \n&gt; SrimadBhagavatam) and Chandi Kavacha are the most potent k=\r\navachas.\n&gt;\n&gt; But please note that chanting a kavacha once or twice or even =\r\nonce or \n&gt; twice a day is hardly sufficient. If one has enough purity alrea=\r\ndy, \n&gt; most mantras work right away. But most of us have very dense \n&gt; cond=\r\nitioning and the energy of mantras gets dispersed. The energy of \n&gt; the pla=\r\nnet/deity of the kavacha we chant cannot form a sheath around \n&gt; us easily.=\r\n It requires intense sadhana for most people. If one chants \n&gt; a kavacha 10=\r\n-30 times everyday and does it for 40-60 days, then some \n&gt; kind of results=\r\n can be expected. Intense sadhana with any mantra is \n&gt; needed for most peo=\r\nple to see some results. Getting things done by a \n&gt; professional priest is=\r\n also not that useful, as there are very very \n&gt; few priests with the requi=\r\nred purity, the ability to identify with \n&gt; your problem and the ability to=\r\n transfer the energy.

P=\r\nlease do not answer this with answers like &quot;faith&quot; or &quot;fate&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When Vi=\r\nvekananda first met Margaret Noble (Sister Nivedita), he told her &lt;BR&gt;that =\r\nreligion should not be a matter of &quot;faith&quot;, but a matter of &lt;BR&gt;&quot;experience=\r\n&quot;. In the beginning, one may start with blind faith, but &lt;BR&gt;eventually one=\r\n has to know by experience. Otherwise, it is not of much &lt;BR&gt;use. The probl=\r\nem in the world right now is that there are many relgions &lt;BR&gt;led by people=\r\n who have not experienced god in any manner and yet leading &lt;BR&gt;people. Thi=\r\ns has resulted in people fighting and killing in the name of &lt;BR&gt;god.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Anyway, coming back to your question, I did not say planetar=\r\ny kavachas &lt;BR&gt;are a much. In fact, I said Chandi kavacham and Narayana kav=\r\nacham are &lt;BR&gt;better for most people. In fact, any prayer can protect one, =\r\nif one does &lt;BR&gt;with enough intensity for enough duration.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;I never said or will say that doing a\n particular ritual or mantra is t=\r\nhe &lt;BR&gt;only way to solve a particular problem or to experience a particular=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;aspect of god. Just as one can reach a mountain top from various sides=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;using various paths, one can reach god using various paths. God is not=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;elsewhere, but within us. But, the conditioning accumulated thru many =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;lives makes us look at things with attraction and aversion and mind &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;vibrates with attraction, aversion, pride, shame, anger, jealosy etc. If &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;mind becomes nearly still, one can be in bliss and the divine energy &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;within expresses outside. The goal of various relgions is to take the &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nmind to that state.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There are many ways to facilitate that. Chanting=\r\n a sacred combinations &lt;BR&gt;of syllables with a focused mind is one way. In =\r\nmy opinion, one can &lt;BR&gt;achieve one-pointedness of mind with any syllable c=\r\nombination. Mind &lt;BR&gt;achieving one-pointedness with any mantra and/or menta=\r\nl imagery is a &lt;BR&gt;good thing. But\n depending the mantra/imagery, a differe=\r\nnt kind of energy &lt;BR&gt;envelopes that focused mind, purifies it and affects =\r\nit. It just so &lt;BR&gt;happens that many great realized yogis came on the bless=\r\ned land of India &lt;BR&gt;and cataloged many mantras and imagery. In other relig=\r\nions also, many &lt;BR&gt;people have experienced one-pointedness of mind on a &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;thought/imagery/sound combination and experienced divinity. A muslim can =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;take a surah from Quran and meditate with it. In fact, some sufi saints=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;did experience divinity like that. Also, there are paths other than &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;meditation. Serving others and trying to see god in all is a valid path &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;too. Oneday, mind can experience god that way too.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;While other ar=\r\neas of the world had their share of realized souls, India &lt;BR&gt;had just too =\r\nmany of them. What is known today as Hinduism has a rich &lt;BR&gt;library of kno=\r\nwledge from their experiences and revelations. One can try &lt;BR&gt;a path that =\r\nwas traversed by others and\n is well-understood. It does not &lt;BR&gt;mean those=\r\n on the other side of the mountain are doomed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; doi=\r\nng homams or not doing homams or any other hindu worship method&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Japa=\r\nm and homam are not the monopoly of any religion and not just &quot;Hindu &lt;BR&gt;wo=\r\nrship methods&quot;. People who meditated with special chants and &lt;BR&gt;experience=\r\nd ecstasy, bliss and inner divinity came in every part of the &lt;BR&gt;world and=\r\n in every religion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As for homam, sacredness of fire and the ability=\r\n to connect to the &lt;BR&gt;divine faster when using fire, was known to many rel=\r\nigions. Not only &lt;BR&gt;Hindus, but native Americans worshipped god in fire, Z=\r\noroastrians did &lt;BR&gt;it, ancient Greco-Romans did it, some Buddhists did it,=\r\n some south &lt;BR&gt;Americans did it, some Scandinavians did it, and so on. The=\r\nre are &lt;BR&gt;references in Bible of even Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Mose=\r\ns having &lt;BR&gt;worshipped god in fire. For example, GENESIS 8:20 says &quot;And No=\r\nah builded &lt;BR&gt;an\n altar unto the Lord; and took of every clean beast, and =\r\nof every &lt;BR&gt;clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar&quot;. The Kor=\r\nban Olah &lt;BR&gt;(&quot;whole offering&quot;) of Judaism, where a whole animal was burnt =\r\nin fire, &lt;BR&gt;is very similar to &quot;poornaahuti&quot; (whole offering) of homam whe=\r\nre a full &lt;BR&gt;coconut symbolizing head or ego is burnt in fire. The seven c=\r\nandles of &lt;BR&gt;minorah, an integral part of judaism, remind us of the seven =\r\ntongues of &lt;BR&gt;Agni.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;New Testament refers to baptism with fire (bapt=\r\nism is purification by &lt;BR&gt;sprinkling or dipping in holy water). John the B=\r\naptist says, &quot;I indeed &lt;BR&gt;baptize you with water unto repentance, but He w=\r\nho is coming after me is &lt;BR&gt;mightier than I =E2=80=93 He will baptize you =\r\nwith the Holy Spirit and fire.&quot; &lt;BR&gt;(MATTHEW 3:11). Purification with fire =\r\nis superior to purification with &lt;BR&gt;water. Note that fire is clubbed with =\r\nHoly Spirit here. In Veda also, &lt;BR&gt;fire is used as a symbol of Self.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;Many seekers in\n many religions achieved the ascension of individual &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nconsciousness into cosmic consciousness using the medium of fire. With &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nadvancing Kali yuga, knowledge has given way to ignorance in many &lt;BR&gt;relig=\r\nions and now finally in Hinduism too! However, a Satya yuga like &lt;BR&gt;sub-pe=\r\nriod within Kali yuga is coming again.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;BTW, the under construction w=\r\nebsite &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://fireyoga.net/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http=\r\n://FireYoga.net&lt;/A&gt; has some more &lt;BR&gt;information along these lines.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;--------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writ=\r\nings,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_bl=\r\nank&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Films that make a difference: &lt;A =\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow\n target=3D_blank&gt;http://=\r\nSaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/vedic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jyotish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/JyotishWritings&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yah=\r\noo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Twitter ID: @homam108&lt;BR&gt;--------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailt=\r\no:JyotishGroup%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D=\r\n&quot;mailto:JyotishGroup%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, V=\r\nenkat Rao &lt;mail2venkyrao@...&gt; &lt;BR&gt;wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Pranaam Nara=\r\nsimhaji,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; In this world,population of Hindus are less compar=\r\ned to Muslims and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; there are people following different religion.Mo=\r\nst of the other &lt;BR&gt;&gt; religion do not incorporate worshipping planets - =\r\nbe it with -sincere &lt;BR&gt;&gt; worship or insincere worship or doing\n homams =\r\nor not doing homams or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; any other hindu worship method.If that is t=\r\nhe case how do we see &lt;BR&gt;&gt; planets protecting them.Please do not answer=\r\n this with answers like &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;faith&quot; or &quot;fate&quot; as they are nothing but =\r\nexcuses since your mail &lt;BR&gt;&gt; below claims to be very scientific and res=\r\nult oriented for performed &lt;BR&gt;&gt; actions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Eg-&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; If one chants a kavacha 10-30 times everyday and does it for 40-60 &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; days, then some kind of results can be expected.

Kavachas\n of various deities (or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; planets) are protective sheaths=\r\n covering one&#39;s consciousness and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; stopping harmful influences.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Grahas (literal meaning: those who grasp or get hold of) give =\r\ngood and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; bad results by grasping one&#39;s consciousness and affecting=\r\n it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Each planet has positives and negatives, in general an=\r\nd also based on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the chart. If one chants the kavacha of a planet m=\r\nany times, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; eventually a protective sheath is formed around one&#39;s c=\r\nonsciousness &lt;BR&gt;&gt; with the nature and energy of that planet. This will =\r\nobviously offer &lt;BR&gt;&gt; protection that is consistent with the nature of t=\r\nhat planet, in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; general and in one&#39;s chart. But, please remember th=\r\nat reading the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; kavacha of any planet will NOT harm you. Even the k=\r\navacha of 8th lord &lt;BR&gt;&gt; or 6th lord will not harm one.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nSuppose one has Pi lagna. If he chants Sukra kavacha, Venus will &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n =\r\nprotect one from loss of courage (3rd), problems to shoulders (3rd), &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; untimely death (i.e. loss of longevity/8th), problems in anus/genital &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; area (8th) etc. There may be other things based on other factors lik=\r\ne &lt;BR&gt;&gt; aspects, occupancy etc. Based on his inherent nature, Venus may =\r\nalso &lt;BR&gt;&gt; protect in the matters of love, romance, creativity etc also.=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Bottomline is that the aspects of one&#39;s personality that the plan=\r\net is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; conducive to will be protected by the planet&#39;s energy.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If you pick a wrong planet, you may not get the desired result, =\r\nbut no &lt;BR&gt;&gt; harm is done. Even bad planets in your chart will have some=\r\n aspects &lt;BR&gt;&gt; they want to protect and doing their kavacha will protect=\r\n those &lt;BR&gt;&gt; aspects.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best will be to chant the kavachas=\r\n of lagna lord, dispositor of lagna &lt;BR&gt;&gt; lord, Moon&#39;s dispositor and Su=\r\nn&#39;s dispositor. Even better will be to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; chant the kavachas\n of deva=\r\ntas instead of planets. Out of all the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; kavachas I have seen until =\r\nnow, Narayana kavacha (from &lt;BR&gt;&gt; SrimadBhagavatam) and Chandi Kavacha a=\r\nre the most potent kavachas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; But please note that chanting =\r\na kavacha once or twice or even once or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; twice a day is hardly suff=\r\nicient. If one has enough purity already, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; most mantras work right =\r\naway. But most of us have very dense &lt;BR&gt;&gt; conditioning and the energy o=\r\nf mantras gets dispersed. The energy of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the planet/deity of the ka=\r\nvacha we chant cannot form a sheath around &lt;BR&gt;&gt; us easily. It requires =\r\nintense sadhana for most people. If one chants &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a kavacha 10-30 tim=\r\nes everyday and does it for 40-60 days, then some &lt;BR&gt;&gt; kind of results =\r\ncan be expected. Intense sadhana with any mantra is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; needed for mos=\r\nt people to see some results. Getting things done by a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; professiona=\r\nl priest is also not that useful, as there are very very\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; few prie=\r\nsts with the required purity, the ability to identify with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; your pr=\r\noblem and the ability to transfer the energy. For most people, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the=\r\n best solution is to learn and chant by themselves.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best re=\r\ngards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt;
