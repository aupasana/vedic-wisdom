He\nwas inclined =\r\nto make money. He was considered a nice young man and very\nhandsome. There =\r\nwas a rich widow. She fell in love with this young man, and\nthey married. W=\r\nhen Mohammed had become emperor over the larger part of the\nworld, the Roma=\r\nn and Persian empires were all under his feet, and he had a\nnumber of wives=\r\n. When one day he was asked which wife he liked best, he\npointed to his fir=\r\nst wife: &quot;Because she believed [in] me first.&quot; Women have\nfaith.... Gain in=\r\ndependence, gain everything, but do not lose that\ncharacteristic of women! =\r\n...\n\nMohammed&#39;s heart was sick at the sin, idolatry and mock worship,\nsuper=\r\nstitions and human sacrifices, and so on. The Jews were degraded by the\nChr=\r\nistians. On the other hand, the Christians were worse degraded than his\nown=\r\n countrymen.\n\nWe are always in a hurry. [But] if any great work is to be do=\r\nne, there must\nbe great preparation. ... After much praying, day and night,=\r\n Mohammed began\nto have dreams and visions. Gabriel appeared to him in a dr=\r\neam and told him\nthat he was the messenger of truth. He told him that the m=\r\nessage of Jesus,\nof Moses, and all the prophets would be lost and asked him=\r\n to go and preach.\nSeeing the Christians preaching politics in the name of =\r\nJesus, seeing the\nPersians preaching dualism, Mohammed said: &quot;Our God is on=\r\ne God. He is the\nLord of all that exists. There is no comparison between Hi=\r\nm and any other.&quot;\n\nGod is God. There is no philosophy, no complicated code =\r\nof ethics. &quot;Our God\nis one without a second, and Mohammed is the Prophet.&quot; =\r\n... Mohammed began to\npreach it in the streets of Mecca. ... They began to =\r\npersecute him, and he\nfled into the city of [Medina]. He began to fight, an=\r\nd the whole race became\nunited. [Mohammedanism] deluged the world in the na=\r\nme of the Lord. The\ntremendous conquering power! ...\n\nYou ... people have v=\r\nery hard ideas and are so superstitious and prejudiced!\nThese messengers mu=\r\nst have come from God, else how could they have been so\ngreat? You look at =\r\nevery defect. Each one of us has his defects. Who hasn&#39;t?\nI can point out m=\r\nany defects in the Jews. The wicked are always looking for\ndefects. ... Fli=\r\nes come and seek for the [ulcer], and bees come only for the\nhoney in the f=\r\nlower. Do not follow the way of the fly but that of the\nbee....\n\nMohammed m=\r\narried quite a number of wives afterwards. Great men may marry two\nhundred =\r\nwives each. &quot;Giants&quot; like you, I would not allow to marry one wife.\nThe cha=\r\nracters of the great souls are mysterious, their methods past our\nfinding o=\r\nut. We must not judge them. Christ may judge Mohammed. Who are you\nand I? L=\r\nittle babies. What do we understand of these great souls? ...\n\n[Mohammedani=\r\nsm] came as a message for the masses. ... The first message was\nequality. .=\r\n.. There is one religion =97 love. No more question of race,\ncolour, [or] a=\r\nnything else. Join it! That practical quality carried the day.\n... The grea=\r\nt message was perfectly simple. Believe in one God, the creator\nof heaven a=\r\nnd earth. All was created out of nothing by Him. Ask no\nquestions. ...\n\nThe=\r\nir temples are like Protestant churches. ... no music, no paintings, no\npic=\r\ntures. A pulpit in the corner; on that lies the Koran. The people all\nstand=\r\n in line. No priest, no person, no bishop. ... The man who prays must\nstand=\r\n at the side of the audience.
