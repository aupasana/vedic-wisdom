T=\r\nhe ways of god are very mysterious and we humans especially in this yug hav=\r\ne no right to ask her ruling. Calling god &quot;damn&quot; hurts especially for those=\r\n who pray her like parents. If you don&#39;t like god please keep your feelings=\r\n towards yourself as this forum is not meant for those who hate god.The=C2=\r\n=A0 mail that nobody ji has written is for those who already pray him not f=\r\nor newcomers who have to yet develop love/affection/trust for god...=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; As I write this I show no hatred towards you or those people wh=\r\no talk in similar fashion. It is their ignorance and the soul transformatio=\r\nn doesn&#39;t happen easily. Hence I will definitely pray for your inner growth=\r\n. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Nobody ji has spoken thousand words of wisdom hats off to his th=\r\noughts.=C2=A0 When I went to learn car driving the teacher saw me driving w=\r\nith no attention. He yelled at me and I learnt driving in one day. Some stu=\r\ndents don&#39;t listen when explained gently, some students listen only when th=\r\ne teacher yells so no offences should be taken by anyone.=C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; An=\r\nother thing I always noticed is that for some reason most of them in this f=\r\norum talk with great respect to Narsimha ji and don&#39;t even consider taking =\r\nadvices given by any other devotees. We all know Narsimha ji but we don&#39;t k=\r\nnow which other high raised souls we are talking to. Please talk with respe=\r\nct and consideration towards other devotees also otherwise our prayers are =\r\na complete waste....\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Priya\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ______=\r\n__________________________\n&gt;  From: sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt;\n&gt; To: v=\r\nedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Sent: Friday, June 15, 2012 2:43 PM\n&gt; Subjec=\r\nt: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Karmic liability for Tantra &quot;material sadhana&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;scsa_taker3&quot; &lt;scsa=\r\n_taker3@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; First of all, to anyone reading this , please chan=\r\nt mentally while\n&gt; &gt; reading, time is running out, who knows when you will =\r\nreach the\n&gt; &gt; cremation ground, chant and chant. For those who don&#39;t have a=\r\nnything to\n&gt; &gt; chant, please chant ram, waheguru, allah or any name, mental=\r\nly. Recite\n&gt; &gt; any mantra, anything, every waking moment should be devoted =\r\nto god,\n&gt; &gt; because its the only worthwhile thing to do as a human.\n&gt; &gt; Bol=\r\no hari bolo gopaal bolo\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the advice to chant till the cremat=\r\nion ground. Sound advice no doubt.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately Durga is partial to s=\r\nome of her children it seems, and not all of us are blessed with the intens=\r\ne desire to chant as you seem to be. Stop rubbing it in please. \n&gt; \n&gt; What =\r\nis the use of asking us to chant more? Ask her to give us this desire, as s=\r\nhe seems to have done for you. \n&gt; \n&gt; Which brings me to ranting a bit about=\r\n the general injustice of our esteemed Durga. The Atman is sexless, but the=\r\n Atman in female form has been treated worse than the Atman in male form ov=\r\ner the centuries...even today it is being murdered in the womb (female foet=\r\nicide), raped, burnt in Sati etc etc. Yes yes it is deathless etc, but whil=\r\ne in this ignorant state, it still suffers in the form of women. I hasten t=\r\no add that I am no feminist but right now, I&#39;m furious with Durga. How outr=\r\nageous that for centuries, and even today, women were not allowed to be ini=\r\ntiated into the Gayatri (which is to the Goddess). Why aren&#39;t there more wo=\r\nmen saints? The ratio of female to male saints is probably 1:10. It&#39;s blood=\r\ny disheartening. And what is the point of covering us with ignorance (it&#39;s =\r\nher fault, she is the Avidya Maya), and then yelling at us for not being wi=\r\nse (as she does in all the scriptures). If she wants to save us, she will h=\r\nave to create in us the desire\n&gt;  to do japa or whatever. I wash my hands o=\r\nf the whole thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; So don&#39;t tell us to chant, tell her to tell us to c=\r\nhant. Like she told you to. It&#39;s not our fault.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ok rant over. I&#39;m goin=\r\ng to control my temper and do some Om Namo Narayanaya repetition now. Who k=\r\nnows when it&#39;s time for the cremation ground? You did it for a select few, =\r\nbut not for the rest of us millions- Damn you Durga. \n&gt; \n&gt; Aparna\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
