In \ngeneral, if one engages in an action with a detached mind t=\r\nhat finds the action \nneither attractive nor repulsive, one is not committi=\r\nng a new karma and creating \nnew debts to be settled later. One is merely s=\r\nettling old debts with such \ndetached actions.

This becomes an endless cycle! \n\n=C2=A0\nSex is a highly physical act=\r\nion. While engaging in \nit, it is nearly impossible to detach the mind from=\r\n body and focus on god.

Don&#39;t be over-burdened by it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n          &gt; Moreover, what i read in AGHORA was the important thing is \n=\r\n          not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suppress desires but remove them from the \n          ro=\r\not\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; True, suppressing desire will make the \n          desire come b=\r\nack later. \n&gt; But, if one \n&gt; &gt; keeps \n          fulfilling desires, they ne=\r\nver end!! This is the nature \nof \n          \n&gt; desire. \n&gt; &gt; Whether one des=\r\nires money or knowledge \n          (of anything other than \n&gt; Self) or \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n physical \n          pleasures, the desire will never end no matter how muc=\r\nh \n&gt; one \n          gets.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Removing desire from the root often \n   =\r\n       requires suppressing the \n&gt; desire \n&gt; &gt; temporarily. \n          But =\r\nthe thing to remember from the Aghora book is \n&gt; that just \n          \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nsuppressing desire is not sufficient. Practice \n          suppressing \n&gt; de=\r\nsires, but do \n&gt; &gt; remember that the \n          final goal is to uproot it =\r\nfully and keep \n&gt; working on \n          it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The only reason for =\r\nwhich i keep \n          trying for brahamcharya is if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vimalananda too=\r\nk such \n          a long time probasbly i can also do it , \nif\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not \n =\r\n         in 6 years at least in 10-12 years\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That is \n          the=\r\n right spirit!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Spiritual progress \n          involves a lot of thi=\r\nngs and brahmacharya is \n&gt; one thing. \n          \n&gt; &gt; The most fundamental =\r\nthing is to overcome ego and not \n          become \n&gt; attached to \n&gt; &gt; thin=\r\ngs. Developing \n          detachment to one&#39;s actions and possessions \nand =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n          developing a sense of surrender is the most fundamental thi=\r\nng.\n&gt; \n          &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There are several things in spiritual progress. \n  =\r\n        They all come \n&gt; together! One \n&gt; &gt; person may develop \n          d=\r\netachment to actions and possessions and \n&gt; brahmacharya \n          \n&gt; &gt; ma=\r\ny become easy as a result. One person may achieve \n          brahmacharya \n=\r\n&gt; first and \n&gt; &gt; detachment may become \n          easy as a result and come=\r\n later. Various \n&gt; signs of \n&gt; \n          &gt; spiritual progress come almost =\r\ntogether, but the exact order can \n          \n&gt; change from \n&gt; &gt; person to =\r\nperson. Thus, do not be \n          disappointed by your inability \n&gt; to get=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; \n          something. It may be possible to work it out from another =\r\n\n          angle!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n          Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; -----=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- \n          --------- --------- -\n-\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; \n  =\r\n        Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: \nhttp://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpa=\r\nna\n&gt; &gt; \n          Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- \n   =\r\n       wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comca=\r\nst. net\n&gt; &gt; \n          Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst=\r\n rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri \n          Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.=\r\nSriJagan nath.org\n&gt; \n          &gt; ------------ --------- --------- ---------=\r\n --------- --------- \n          -\n- \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- =\r\n\n          \n&gt; &gt; Namaste sir\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; i know you are \n          lot busy but=\r\n since i couldn;t ask this question \non a\n&gt; &gt; \n          public forum as it=\r\n may probably offend others.\n&gt; &gt; If you \n          have time ,if you could =\r\nplease reply.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was \n          thinking this for many days\n&gt; &gt; tha=\r\nt as mentioned in recent \n          thread on brahamcharya,\n&gt; &gt; it was impo=\r\nrtant to maintain \n          brahamcharya but i wanted to ask \nthat\n&gt; &gt; eve=\r\nn \n          vimalananda had to work for 6 years for overcoming lust \n     =\r\n     \nthough\n&gt; &gt; he had his deity with him from the very early \n          i=\r\nn life.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; how can normal college going \n          people like me who=\r\n don&#39;t even have a\n&gt; &gt; deity obtain this \n          goal.\n&gt; &gt; Though i try =\r\nto maintain physical brahamcharya for \n          few months but\n&gt; &gt; after t=\r\nhat i am not able to hold it \n          ,\n&gt; &gt; and even if i maintain some p=\r\nhysical chastity it \n          refuses to go \nout\n&gt; &gt; of mind\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n   =\r\n       Moreover, what i read in AGHORA was the important thing is not\n&gt; \n  =\r\n        &gt; suppress desires but remove them from the root\n&gt; &gt; \n          \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; So, how can i finish it completely from my mind\n&gt; \n          &gt; Though i h=\r\nave read Swami Sivananda&#39;s book on Practice of \n&gt; \n          Brahamcharya\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; but i don&#39;t think i have made any spiritual \n          progress in maint=\r\naing\n&gt; &gt; Brahamcharya\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n          &gt; and sometimes it makes me guilt r=\r\nidden.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n          &gt; The only reason for which i keep trying for brah=\r\namcharya is \n          if\n&gt; &gt; vimalananda took such a long time probasbly i=\r\n can also \n          do it , if\n&gt; &gt; not in 6 years at least in 10-12 years\n=\r\n&gt; \n          &gt; \n&gt; &gt; you can also reply on VEDIC WISDOM group but if you \n  =\r\n        can remove my\n&gt; &gt; identity from this that would be \n          appre=\r\nciable\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; if what i worte offended you \n          please delete this =\r\nmail\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; regards\n&gt; \n          &gt; &lt;deleted&gt;\n&gt; \n        &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n      \n\n  =\r\n  \n    \n\t\n\t \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n      Add more friends to your messenger=\r\n and enjoy!

But, the problem is that we incur new debts \nwhile paying off old d=\r\nebts in this matter, like in many other matters. In \ngeneral, if one engage=\r\ns in an action with a detached mind that finds the action \nneither attracti=\r\nve nor repulsive, one is not committing a new karma and creating \nnew debts=\r\n to be settled later. One is merely settling old debts with such \ndetached =\r\nactions. But, if one engages in an action with an attached mind that \nfinds=\r\n the action either attractive or repulsive, one IS committing a new karma \n=\r\nand creating new debts to be settled later. This becomes an endless cycle! =\r\n\n&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Sex is a highly physical action. While en=\r\ngaging in \nit, it is nearly impossible to detach the mind from body and foc=\r\nus on god. Mind \ninvariably gets attached to the body and its experience. T=\r\nhus, one is not only \nsettling old debts by giving pleasure, but one also c=\r\nreates a new debt by \nderiving pleasure again. This is an endless cycle.&lt;/f=\r\nont&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;f=\r\nont face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n=\r\n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=\r\n=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D=\r\n&quot;2&quot;&gt;Scriptures cover a lot of ground and they say a lot \nof things that may=\r\n contradict one another. Yes, one who marries and begets \nchildren is neede=\r\nd for the continuation of human race and smooth running of \nsociety. But, d=\r\nharma and moksha are different. Performing your duties sincerely \nis good a=\r\nnd takes you to heaven for a while and then brings you back here.

(???)&nbsp; still he was called brahmachar=\r\ni. . how? i am \n        bit confused.. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I personally feel that to ha=\r\nve sexual desire and \n        not fulfilling it,&nbsp; cannot be termed as =\r\nbrahmacharya. . it is like \n        cheating yourself... and if you are mar=\r\nried and if you donot fulfill \n        desire of your spouse is also not go=\r\nod.. Please \n        advise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rajesh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;T=\r\nue, 16/12/08, \n        utpal pathak &lt;i&gt;&lt;vedic_pathak@ yahoo.com&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;=\r\n/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n        &lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, =\r\n16, 255);&quot;&gt;From: \n          utpal pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@ yahoo.com&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] \n          Re: Regarding Brahamcharya&lt;br&gt;To: \n    =\r\n      vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;br&gt;Date: Tuesday, 16 December, 2008, 2=\r\n:12 \n          PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n          &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv30487598&quot;&gt;\n          &lt;div=\r\n id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n          &lt;p&gt;Namaste,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let me put some thoughts an=\r\nd i&#39;ll continue writng \n          as it keeps on &lt;br&gt;occuring to me...&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;1) Thakur&#39;s marraige was \n          never a marriage in physical sense&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) The author of \n          &#39;Autobiography of a Yogi&#39;, Paramhamsa Yog=\r\nananda has &lt;br&gt;mentioned in \n          the same book that his parents lived=\r\n like a Husband &amp; &lt;br&gt;wife \n          only once a year to biget child.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) I&#39;ve read some where that \n          our ancient Rishis though ma=\r\nrried, &lt;br&gt;lived extremely restarined \n          married life and that too =\r\nonly to beget &lt;br&gt;children.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) Adi \n          Shankaracharya, Swami =\r\nVivekananda and all monastic disciples &lt;br&gt;of \n          Thakur, Swami Siva=\r\nnada, Gnaneshwar, SainBaba, Aurobindo, Sri Sri \n          &lt;br&gt;Ravishankar a=\r\nnd countless known realised souls never married (We \n          &lt;br&gt;assume t=\r\nhat they maintained perfect brahmacharya) .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5) Many \n          saint=\r\ns such as Tukaaram, Eknaath, Narasee Mehta, Jalaaram, &lt;br&gt;Rishis \n         =\r\n of yore, Ekanaath, Mirabai, Jana Bai, and many other saints &lt;br&gt;were \n    =\r\n      married. but i am confident that at some stage in their life &lt;br&gt;they=\r\n \n          would have ended, forever, the physical relationship with their=\r\n \n          &lt;br&gt;spouses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6)complete Brahmachaya includes Physical &a=\r\nmp; \n          Mental. physical &lt;br&gt;brahmacharya includes Restrain of all t=\r\nhe \n          indriyaas and not just the &lt;br&gt;procreative organs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The=\r\nre are \n          many things looks contradictory in above but if one see &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;deeper \n          then there is a wonderful synergy. there is a common t=\r\nruth. &lt;br&gt;what \n          i&#39;ve started believing from the above written tho=\r\nughts as well &lt;br&gt;as \n          many unwritten thoughts is that Brahmachrya=\r\n is one of the most \n          &lt;br&gt;important vertue for realisation. but it=\r\n seems that even married \n          &lt;br&gt;people will also start maintaining =\r\nthat, knowingly or unknowingly \n          &lt;br&gt;before final realisation. act=\r\nually, it seems that Like \n          realisation, &lt;br&gt;Brahmachrya aslo DAWN=\r\nS !!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warm \n          Regards,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Utpal &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- In &lt;a rel=3D=\r\n&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;=\r\n&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;rajarshi14&quot; \n          &lt;rajarshi14=\r\n@ ...&gt; &lt;br&gt;wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Dear \n          Members&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; I was re reading this thread on the light of \n          something I had =\r\ncome &lt;br&gt;&gt; across very recently. This is regarding \n          Swami Brah=\r\nmananda. I was &lt;br&gt;&gt; reading a book on his life and \n          various i=\r\nncidents connected to him &lt;br&gt;&gt; observed by other saints \n          and =\r\nhis brother disciples.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Swami Brahmananda or \n          Rak=\r\nhal Maharaj was the spiritual son of &lt;br&gt;Thakur. &lt;br&gt;&gt; And no \n         =\r\n doubt a great spiritual super giant. Thakur used to say he &lt;br&gt;&gt; \n     =\r\n     was one of Sri Krishna&#39;s eternal playmates who had reincarnated on \n  =\r\n        &lt;br&gt;&gt; this plane.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; During his stay in various \n =\r\n         monastaries of the Ramakrishna Mission, &lt;br&gt;&gt; often other monks=\r\n \n          used to send new initiates to Rakhal Maharaj for &lt;br&gt;&gt; hios =\r\n\n          blessings. It was a generally accepted idea among the &lt;br&gt;discip=\r\nles \n          &lt;br&gt;&gt; of Thakur that any one who is blessed by Rakhal Mah=\r\naraj will \n          never &lt;br&gt;&gt; again be troubled by problems of lack o=\r\nf Brahmacharya. \n          &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; One day an individual came to =\r\nRakhal Maharaj asking \n          for his &lt;br&gt;&gt; blessings and said &quot;Mahar=\r\naj, please give me \n          brahmacharya as a &lt;br&gt;&gt; blessing&quot;. Hearing=\r\n this suddenly Rakhal \n          Maharaj said, &quot;Why do you &lt;br&gt;&gt; people =\r\nalways come asking for \n          Brahmacharya? Was does not any one &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; come to me asking me to \n          give him/her God?

Someone &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; else=\r\n may have to first \n          overcome his lust even to have a vision &lt;br&gt;o=\r\nf &lt;br&gt;&gt; the deity.. \n          &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; What is good for goose is n=\r\not good for gander. In \n          general, it is &lt;br&gt;&gt; good to try &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; to overcome lust if \n          it is possible.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; Several &quot;normal college \n          going people&quot; were taken under h=\r\nis wings &lt;br&gt;&gt; by &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and t=\r\nransformed into spiritual giants. \n          &lt;br&gt;&gt; Swami &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; V=\r\nivekananda, Swami Brahmananda, Swami \n          Yogananda etc were college =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; students &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; when they \n          met Ramakrishna.&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; But it is not easy to \n          overcome lust at all=\r\n. Several of &lt;br&gt;&gt; Ramakrishna&#39; s &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          disciples als=\r\no struggled with it initially and overcame lust &lt;br&gt;with \n          &lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; his &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; blessings. Lust is a very basic human \n          instin=\r\nct and not at all &lt;br&gt;easy &lt;br&gt;&gt; to kill &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          comple=\r\ntely.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; In the beginning, it is ok if \n          t=\r\nhe thought does not go out of the &lt;br&gt;&gt; mind. Set a &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; \n     =\r\n     rule for 20 days or 40 days or 108 days or some period like that \n    =\r\n      &lt;br&gt;&gt; and &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; maintain physical brahmacharya. Don&#39;t worr=\r\ny \n          if thoughts come.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Feeling of guilt =\r\nis a \n          weight and it does not help in overcoming &lt;br&gt;&gt; the basi=\r\nc &lt;br&gt;&gt; \n          &gt; problem. Don&#39;t be over-burdened by it.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          &gt; Moreover, what i read in AGHORA was the i=\r\nmportant thing is \n          not&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; suppress desires but rem=\r\nove them from the \n          root&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; True, suppress=\r\ning desire will make the \n          desire come back later. &lt;br&gt;&gt; But, i=\r\nf one &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; keeps \n          fulfilling desires, they never end!! T=\r\nhis is the nature &lt;br&gt;of \n          &lt;br&gt;&gt; desire. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Whether =\r\none desires money or knowledge \n          (of anything other than &lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nSelf) or &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; physical \n          pleasures, the desire will never=\r\n end no matter how much &lt;br&gt;&gt; one \n          gets.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Removing desire from the root often \n          requires suppressing t=\r\nhe &lt;br&gt;&gt; desire &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; temporarily. \n          But the thing to r=\r\nemember from the Aghora book is &lt;br&gt;&gt; that just \n          &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n suppressing desire is not sufficient. Practice \n          suppressing &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; desires, but do &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; remember that the \n          final goal =\r\nis to uproot it fully and keep &lt;br&gt;&gt; working on \n          it.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The only reason for which i keep \n          trying f=\r\nor brahamcharya is if&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; vimalananda took such \n          a =\r\nlong time probasbly i can also do it , &lt;br&gt;if&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; not \n      =\r\n    in 6 years at least in 10-12 years&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; That is \n=\r\n          the right spirit!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Spiritual progress \n=\r\n          involves a lot of things and brahmacharya is &lt;br&gt;&gt; one thing. =\r\n\n          &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; The most fundamental thing is to overcome ego and =\r\nnot \n          become &lt;br&gt;&gt; attached to &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; things. Developing=\r\n \n          detachment to one&#39;s actions and possessions &lt;br&gt;and &lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; \n          developing a sense of surrender is the most fundamental thing=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&gt; \n          &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; There are several things in spiritu=\r\nal progress.. \n          They all come &lt;br&gt;&gt; together! One &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n person may develop \n          detachment to actions and possessions and &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; brahmacharya \n          &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; may become easy as a result. O=\r\nne person may achieve \n          brahmacharya &lt;br&gt;&gt; first and &lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; detachment may become \n          easy as a result and come later. Vario=\r\nus &lt;br&gt;&gt; signs of &lt;br&gt;&gt; \n          &gt; spiritual progress come almos=\r\nt together, but the exact order can \n          &lt;br&gt;&gt; change from &lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; person to person. Thus, do not be \n          disappointed by your in=\r\nability &lt;br&gt;&gt; to get &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          something. It may be possi=\r\nble to work it out from another \n          angle!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          Narasimha&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- \n          --------- --------- -&lt;br&gt;-&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n;

&gt; he had his deity with=\r\n him from the very early \n          in life.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; how=\r\n can normal college going \n          people like me who don&#39;t even have a&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt;
