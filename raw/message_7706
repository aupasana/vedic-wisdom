I do it always, irrespective of consequences. =\r\nSo your mail and view point is thoroughly welcome as far as I&#39;m concerned.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nI will try to explain a few points from your reply, as I see it.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n&lt;&lt;It is not their identity that you see, it is the identity which we ha=\r\nve been exposed to since ages. Just an analogy, Tendulkar may actually be a=\r\n great father at home but we only saw the perceivable cricketer aspect of h=\r\nim as it is known to your outside world which dwells on popularity or a pro=\r\nnounced thing. Kali is dreadful Goddess to many who see her physical aspect=\r\n but I did see many homes in Kolkata praying her as family Goddess. All exp=\r\neriences are PERSONAL in nature between us and the deity and can be abstrac=\r\nt from a different view point.&gt;&gt;\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nYou see my basic point is th=\r\nat Tendulkar is a cricketing genius to 120 Crore Indians, while his identit=\r\ny as a father is limited to 2 children. If you approach Tendulkar and call =\r\nhim father, he may feel weird about it.=C2=A0 Now deities of course are far=\r\n more subtle and complex. One of names of Kaali in her sahashranama is also=\r\n=C2=A0Lalita. If you worship Kaali and expect Her to come to you in the for=\r\nm of Lalita, because the Sahasrahanama of=C2=A0Kaali has the name Lalita,=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0chances are that=C2=A0it may result in=C2=A0a hodgepodge. In th=\r\ne worst case it may result in fright. To give a very crude example, this is=\r\n like buying the DVD for the movie &quot;The Exorcist&quot; while consciously and sub=\r\n-consciously expecting to see &quot;Kaho Na Pyar Hai&quot;!\n=C2=A0\nYes Kaali is the m=\r\nost worshipped deity in Bengal for various historical reasons, chief of whi=\r\nch being that fantastic amount of Kali worshippers have lived in Bengal/Ass=\r\nam/Tripura/Odisha. This has caused=C2=A0the notion of Kali to get ingrained=\r\n in the very culture. Even sufis in Bengal worship Kaali. But the key is to=\r\n accept Her and love Her, AS SHE IS! Which means, say if you find the garla=\r\nnd of skulls on her neck and the skull in her hand disturbing, or if you fi=\r\nnd the blood-dripping from the freshly cut head in Her hand difficult to re=\r\nlate to, you cannot cannot replace=C2=A0those from her iconography and expe=\r\nct to get clear results from your worship. Love Her the way She is, in her =\r\nferocity and wildness and beauty. When you do that, you&#39;re game.=C2=A0Yes S=\r\nhe=C2=A0can be dreadful, but that is how She is loved by her devotees, with=\r\nout trying to modify Her innate nature and characteristics. Relate to Her a=\r\ns Ma, but don&#39;t ask Her to remove the skulls. \n=C2=A0\nThe=C2=A0traditional=\r\n=C2=A0idea, which I believe to be correct,=C2=A0is to worship the form in t=\r\nhe way it is and love and relate to it in all its attributes. I know a cert=\r\nain person who used to=C2=A0worship a very fierce form of Devi but mentally=\r\n was=C2=A0unable to relate to that form. She was adviced by her guru to do =\r\nso, who used to worship that fierce form himself. When I asked her what doe=\r\ns she feel about the deity, she said I mentally think of Her of Gouri but p=\r\nerform the ritual for the fierce form=C2=A0as my Guru asked me to. I of cou=\r\nrse had no business interfering in the relationship between a Guru and his =\r\ndisciple and so kept my mouth shut, but personally I was extremely skeptica=\r\nl of this approach. When you can&#39;t even love=C2=A0the form you are worshipp=\r\ning, then what kind of worship is that? Later she met another individual wh=\r\no acted as a mentor and gave her a mantra of a much milder form of God. Tod=\r\nay=C2=A0the lady spends nearly=C2=A08 hours every day immersed in the worsh=\r\nip of\n that milder=C2=A0form. Her spiritual life leap-frogged once she star=\r\nted worshipping the milder form of God. Thats why the Tantras stress so hea=\r\nvily on the importance of=C2=A0correct form for each individual. \n=C2=A0\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nIt is not my contention that worshipping an urga deity is difficult =\r\nor simple compared to worshipping a milder form. Both are difficult and to =\r\nsucceed in any worship=C2=A0a combination of various factors must fall in p=\r\nlace. It&#39;s like trying to judge, which among Rugby and Table-tennis, is a m=\r\nore difficult game. Some like one, some like the other, but you cannot pass=\r\n a judgement about which is more dificult. \n=C2=A0\n-Take Care\n=C2=A0 Rajars=\r\nhi\n\nFrom: Srikanth &lt;srikanthnetworked@...&gt;\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com \nSent: Wednesday, 21 December 2011 8:09 PM\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdo=\r\nm] Re: Mahavidya experience\n\n\n=C2=A0 \nJai Maa Durge.\n\nRajarshiji,\n\nAgain, M=\r\ny two cents with my own humble understanding:\n\nIt is not their identity tha=\r\nt you see, it is the identity which we have been exposed to since ages.

These five corpses are of=C2=A0Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Mahadeva=\r\n and Sadashiva. Simply put, She is representative energy of everything. Per=\r\nsonally, I don&#39;t like this explanation. To me the five pretas are the five =\r\nkoshas surrounding the human organism. She controls all of them.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;N=\r\now if we take this line=C2=A0literally, She sits on an asana of five pretas=\r\n - spirits of a kind. You must have read the biographies of many siddhas wh=\r\no worshipped Lalita Tripursundari. How many have you found who has had a vi=\r\nsion of Her in this form, sitting on corpses? The Lalita Sahashranama is a =\r\ncomplete text of ALL possible attirbutes of Lalita Tripursundari. Of these,=\r\n what percentage of names do you find which can be described as ugra?\n&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;Consider this example. If you ask 100 people who is Sachin Tendulkar, =\r\nall will reply that he is a great cricketer. But isn&#39;t Tendulkar also a fat=\r\nher, brother, son, husband, a responsible citizen of India, a consumer at t=\r\nhe local grocery store, and for all you know maybe even a reasonable bathro=\r\nom singer? These are all his identities too. But why don&#39;t we refer to them=\r\n when we speak of Tendulkar? Because his central defining identity for us i=\r\ns his cricket.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Same way, each deity eventually is everything. But =\r\neach has its own &quot;defining identity&quot; which has its own set of attributes. O=\r\nf all the people worshipping Lalita Tripursundari at this very moment, prob=\r\nably a 2 percent or less=C2=A0will realize Her in this lifetime. Of these, =\r\n99.9999999999999999999 percent will realize Her ONLY in Her=C2=A0chief iden=\r\ntity as Lalita. How many will, or have till date, actually realized that fo=\r\nrm of Lalita Tripursundari sitting on a pretasana? And why is this form=C2=\r\n=A0so remote and so uncommon for most standard worshippers of Lalita Tripur=\r\nsundari? These are questions to ponder!\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;I&#39;ve very little k=\r\nnowledge of worship of Sri Lalita Tripursundari, either theoritical or from=\r\n the point of practical worship,=C2=A0but if there is beauty in this world,=\r\n it is Her.=C2=A0Like a five course gourmet=C2=A0meal, like a sublime poetr=\r\ny, like=C2=A0an efforlessly brilliant music, like a dazzling play of lights=\r\n, like a classic Tendulkar shot,.... all these combined together and much m=\r\nuch=C2=A0more ...you feel and wish that it never comes to an end.

They be=\r\nstow different aspects of Supreme Knowledge. \n&gt;&gt;Worshipping them for winnin=\r\ng a court case or getting a job (which many \n&gt;&gt;people try to do today) is l=\r\nike trying to use a missile to crush an ant.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Regarding your dream, it =\r\nmay be genuine or merely a projection of your \n&gt;&gt;mind. Remember that mind i=\r\ns very powerful and projects various conscious \n&gt;&gt;and sub-conscious conditi=\r\noning as its experiences, especially in a \n&gt;&gt;dream.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;If you feel that t=\r\nhe dream is a genuine experience of the devata, then \n&gt;&gt;keep doing\n the man=\r\ntra and see what happens.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;If you had the same experience with another =\r\nmahavidya, it is possible \n&gt;&gt;that your mind is just projecting. If your min=\r\nd has affinity to a soumya \n&gt;&gt;devata with certain nature, it may imagine wh=\r\nichever devata you worship \n&gt;&gt;to have that nature!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;If your mind is ima=\r\ngining an Ugra devata as a benign smiling form, \n&gt;&gt;perhaps you should stick=\r\n to a Soumya Devata. If the devata really gives \n&gt;&gt;you a darshan in a fierc=\r\ne form, is your mind capable of handling it? If \n&gt;&gt;your mind can visualize =\r\nand perceive an Ugra Devata in a truly fierce \n&gt;&gt;form and yet feel deep lov=\r\ne and surrender for her, then only you are \n&gt;&gt;suitable for such a sadhana.\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Good luck in your sadhana!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Best regards,\n&gt;&gt;Narasimha\n&gt;&gt;----------=\r\n------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;Free Jyotish Software, F=\r\nree Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt;&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals fo=\r\nr short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt;Films t=\r\nhat make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;&gt;Spirituality: http://gro=\r\nups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt;Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;&gt;Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt;&gt;-------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; One of the Mahavidy=\r\nas I got a mantra from an astrologer and did it \n&gt;&gt;&gt; for 40 days, but with =\r\n5 days of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sadhana, it&#39;s was so cool , but got a real vison in dream of =\r\nwhat they \n&gt;&gt;&gt; call ugra devata , but Smiling\n&gt;&gt;&gt; at me???

So you=\r\nr mail and view point is thoroughly welcome as far as I&#39;m concerned.&lt;/div&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;I will try to explain a few points from your reply, =\r\nas I see it.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;&lt;It is not their identity =\r\nthat you see, it is the identity which we have been exposed to since ages. =\r\nJust an analogy, Tendulkar may actually be a great father at home but we on=\r\nly saw the perceivable cricketer aspect of him as it is known to your outsi=\r\nde world which dwells on popularity or a pronounced thing. Kali is dreadful=\r\n Goddess to many who see her physical aspect but I did see many homes in Ko=\r\nlkata praying her as family Goddess. All experiences are PERSONAL in nature=\r\n between us and the deity and can be abstract from a different view point.&=\r\ngt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;You see my basic poi=\r\nnt is that Tendulkar is a cricketing genius to 120 Crore Indians, while his=\r\n identity as a father is limited to 2 children. If you approach Tendulkar a=\r\nnd call him father, he may feel weird about it.&nbsp; &lt;var id=3D&quot;yiv2288732=\r\n6yui-ie-cursor&quot;&gt;&lt;/var&gt;Now deities of course are far more subtle and complex=\r\n. One of names of Kaali in her sahashranama is also&nbsp;Lalita. If you wor=\r\nship Kaali and expect Her to come to you in the form of Lalita, because the=\r\n Sahasrahanama of&nbsp;Kaali has the name Lalita,&nbsp;&nbsp;chances are th=\r\nat&nbsp;it may result in&nbsp;a hodgepodge. In the worst case it may result=\r\n in fright. To give a very crude example, this is like buying the DVD for t=\r\nhe movie &quot;The Exorcist&quot; while consciously and sub-consciously expecting to =\r\nsee &quot;Kaho Na Pyar Hai&quot;!&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Yes Kaali is the most =\r\nworshipped deity in Bengal for various historical reasons, chief of which b=\r\neing that fantastic amount of Kali worshippers have lived in Bengal/Assam/T=\r\nripura/Odisha. This has caused&nbsp;the notion of Kali to get ingrained in =\r\nthe very culture. Even sufis in Bengal worship Kaali. But the key is to acc=\r\nept Her and love Her, AS SHE IS! Which means, say if you find the garland o=\r\nf skulls on her neck and the skull in her hand disturbing, or if you find t=\r\nhe blood-dripping from the freshly cut head in Her hand difficult to relate=\r\n to, you cannot cannot replace&nbsp;those from her iconography and expect t=\r\no get clear results from your worship. Love Her the way She is, in her fero=\r\ncity and wildness and beauty. When you do that, you&#39;re game.&nbsp;Yes She&n=\r\nbsp;can be dreadful, but that is how She is loved by her devotees, without =\r\ntrying to modify Her innate nature and characteristics. Relate to Her as Ma=\r\n, but don&#39;t ask Her\n to remove the skulls. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Th=\r\ne&nbsp;traditional&nbsp;idea, which I believe to be correct,&nbsp;is to wor=\r\nship the form in the way it is and love and relate to it in all its attribu=\r\ntes. I know a certain person who used to&nbsp;worship a very fierce form of=\r\n Devi but mentally was&nbsp;unable to relate to that form. She was adviced =\r\nby her guru to do so, who used to worship that fierce form himself. When I =\r\nasked her what does she feel about the deity, she said I mentally think of =\r\nHer of Gouri but perform the ritual for the fierce form&nbsp;as my Guru ask=\r\ned me to. I of course had no business interfering in the relationship betwe=\r\nen a Guru and his disciple and so kept my mouth shut, but personally I was =\r\nextremely skeptical of this approach. When you can&#39;t even love&nbsp;the for=\r\nm you are worshipping, then what kind of worship is that? Later she met ano=\r\nther individual who acted as a mentor and gave her a mantra of a much milde=\r\nr form of God. Today&nbsp;the lady spends\n nearly&nbsp;8 hours every day im=\r\nmersed in the worship of that milder&nbsp;form. Her spiritual life leap-fro=\r\ngged once she started worshipping the milder form of God. Thats why the Tan=\r\ntras stress so heavily on the importance of&nbsp;correct form for each indi=\r\nvidual. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;It is not my =\r\ncontention that worshipping an urga deity is difficult or simple compared t=\r\no worshipping a milder form. Both are difficult and to succeed in any worsh=\r\nip&nbsp;a combination of various factors must fall in place. It&#39;s like tryi=\r\nng to judge, which among Rugby and Table-tennis, is a more difficult game. =\r\nSome like one, some like the other, but you cannot pass a judgement about w=\r\nhich is more dificult. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;-Take Care&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&nbsp; Rajarshi&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:times=\r\n new roman, new york, times, serif;FONT-SIZE:12pt;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;FONT-FAM=\r\nILY:times new roman, new york, times, serif;FONT-SIZE:12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;=\r\nArial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BORDER-BOTTOM:#ccc 1px solid;BORDER-LEFT:#=\r\nccc 1px solid;HEIGHT:0px;FONT-SIZE:0px;BORDER-TOP:#ccc 1px solid;BORDER-RIG=\r\nHT:#ccc 1px solid;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv22887326hr&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WE=\r\nIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Srikanth &lt;srikanthnetworked@...&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Wednesday=\r\n, 21 December 2011 8:09 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mahavidya experience&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;di=\r\nv id=3D&quot;yiv22887326&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv22887326ygrp-=\r\ntext&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Jai Maa Durge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rajarshiji,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again, My two cents wi=\r\nth my own humble understanding:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is not their identity that you se=\r\ne, it is the identity which we have been exposed to since ages. Just an ana=\r\nlogy, Tendulkar may actually be a great father at home but we only saw the =\r\nperceivable cricketer aspect of him as it is known to your outside world wh=\r\nich dwells on popularity or a pronounced thing. Kali is dreadful Goddess to=\r\n many who see her physical aspect but I did see many homes in Kolkata prayi=\r\nng her as family Goddess. All experiences are PERSONAL in nature between us=\r\n and the deity and can be abstract from a different view point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our =\r\nSubjective experience is based on density of&nbsp; Karmas and the associate=\r\nd Vasanas accumulated over several births coupled with your present life (I=\r\nntensity of it depends on several variables in/out of our control) Sadhana.=\r\n Mother will reveal the respective band of her spectrum as you progress\n fu=\r\nrther using your free will carefully is my view exactly as your physical mo=\r\nther knows when you feel hungry and not in right frame of mind etc etc.(Tho=\r\nugh over simplified a bit)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In general we all wish to pursue sadhana =\r\nwith a thought that she is not very far away and we indeed have a chance to=\r\n reach her or abide by her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m an ant at the foot hills of a mounta=\r\nin and cannot talk about a glorious mountain like &quot;Sri Lalitha Devi&quot;. I wor=\r\nship the Durga energies of her when I go on the karmic field and worship he=\r\nr play as Lalitha when I enjoy the bhoga(healthy body,Mind,Intellect and Ma=\r\nterials) she gave me unasked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would not want to argue but you will=\r\n find many such ugra names in &quot;Gayathri Sahasranaam&quot; too.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;This=\r\n synergistic concept of the Divine Mother was pursued in the sacred literat=\r\nure on Mother worship&lt;br&gt;across many centuries.

Thus, the Divine Mother assumes all the characteristics at one time:the w=\r\nisdom and spiritual intellect of Saraswati, the redeeming spirit of Durga, =\r\nthe wealth, splendour,and cornucopia of Lakshmi or Sri, and the terriblefac=\r\ne of Kali or Gouri.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Medh=C4=81si devi vidit=C4=81khila-=C5=9B=C4=81s=\r\ntra-s=C4=81r=C4=81&lt;br&gt;durg=C4=81si durga-bhavas=C4=81gara-naur-asa=E1=B9=85=\r\ng=C4=81;&lt;br&gt;=C5=9Ari=E1=B8=A5 kai=E1=B9=ADabh=C4=81ri-h=E1=B9=9Bdayaika-k=\r\n=E1=B9=9Bt=C4=81dhiv=C4=81s=C4=81&lt;br&gt;gour=C4=AB tvam-eva =C5=9Ba=C5=9Bi-mau=\r\nli-k=E1=B9=9Bta-prati=E1=B9=A3=E1=B9=ADh=C4=81.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cordially Srikanth&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv22887326gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Wed, Dec 21, 2011 at 4:25 P=\r\nM, rajarshi nandy &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mail=\r\nto:rajarshi14@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:rajarshi14@yaho=\r\no.co.in&quot;&gt;rajarshi14@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquote style=\r\n=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT:rgb(204,204,204) 1px solid;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv22887326gmail_quot=\r\ne&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR:rgb(255,255,255);&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt; \n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR:rgb(255,255,255);FO=\r\nNT-FAMILY:times new roman, new york, times, serif;COLOR:rgb(0,0,0);FONT-SIZ=\r\nE:12pt;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dear Srikanth,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sometime back this question was asked by a friend of mine. =\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv22887326im&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;&lt;&quot; Pancha Pretasanasina, Panch Brahmaswarupini&quot; The one w=\r\nho sits on 4 corpses etc&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;and &quot;Aparna Chandika Chanda Mundasura Nishu=\r\ndini&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;=\r\nTraditionally, so I am told, this verse is ment to understand that She sits=\r\n on a throne held by five corpses. These five corpses are of&nbsp;Brahma, V=\r\nishnu, Rudra, Mahadeva and Sadashiva. Simply put, She is representative ene=\r\nrgy of everything. Personally, I don&#39;t like this explanation. To me the fiv=\r\ne pretas are the five koshas surrounding the human organism. She controls a=\r\nll of them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now if w=\r\ne take this line&nbsp;literally, She sits on an asana of five pretas - spir=\r\nits of a kind. You must have read the biographies of many siddhas who worsh=\r\nipped Lalita Tripursundari. How many have you found who has had a vision of=\r\n Her in this form, sitting on corpses? The Lalita Sahashranama is a complet=\r\ne text of ALL possible attirbutes of Lalita Tripursundari. Of these, what p=\r\nercentage of names do you find which can be described as ugra?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Consider this example. If you as=\r\nk 100 people who is Sachin Tendulkar, all will reply that he is a great cri=\r\ncketer. But isn&#39;t Tendulkar also a father, brother, son, husband, a respons=\r\nible citizen of India, a consumer at the local grocery store, and for all y=\r\nou know maybe even a reasonable bathroom singer? These are all his identiti=\r\nes too. But why don&#39;t we refer to them when we speak of Tendulkar? Because =\r\nhis central defining identity for us is his cricket.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Same way, each deity eventually is everyth=\r\ning. But each has its own &quot;defining identity&quot; which has its own set of attr=\r\nibutes. Of all the people worshipping Lalita Tripursundari at this very mom=\r\nent, probably a 2 percent or less&nbsp;will realize Her in this lifetime. O=\r\nf these, 99.9999999999999999999 percent will realize Her ONLY in Her&nbsp;c=\r\nhief identity as Lalita. How many will, or have till date, actually realize=\r\nd that form of Lalita Tripursundari sitting on a pretasana? And why is this=\r\n form&nbsp;so remote and so uncommon for most standard worshippers of Lalit=\r\na Tripursundari? These are questions to ponder!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;I&#39;ve very little=\r\n knowledge of worship of Sri Lalita Tripursundari, either theoritical or fr=\r\nom the point of practical worship,&nbsp;but if there is beauty in this worl=\r\nd, it is Her.&nbsp;Like a five course gourmet&nbsp;meal, like a sublime poe=\r\ntry, like&nbsp;an efforlessly brilliant music, like a dazzling play of ligh=\r\nts, like a classic Tendulkar shot,.... all these combined together and much=\r\n much&nbsp;more ...you feel and wish that it never comes to an end. It is d=\r\nifficult to describe the feeling that She evokes, but it&#39;s like a flood of =\r\npure, distilled essence of&nbsp;beauty and you feel like there is nothing m=\r\nore to be done, no goal to reach, no path to walk, no battles to fight -&nb=\r\nsp;simply bask in the depth of the moment because therein lies fullfilment =\r\nand a whole new world! She banishes the very roots of the sense of strife a=\r\nnd ugliness from your system... the knowledge that She exists is enough to =\r\nincapacitate you from asking anything\n more. She is THE greatest&nbsp;poetr=\r\ny of all possible Universes of all possible cycles of creation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;=\r\n-Regards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;=\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana;COLOR:navy;FONT-SIZE:10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=\r\n=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;COLOR:rgb(0,0,102);=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#a2a2a2&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;/font=\r\n&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;var&gt;&lt;/var&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:times new roman, new york, times, ser=\r\nif;FONT-SIZE:12pt;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:times new roman, new york, t=\r\nimes, serif;FONT-SIZE:12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:=\r\n0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Srikanth =\r\n&lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:srikanthnetworked@...&quot; targ=\r\net=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:srikanthnetworked@...&quot;&gt;srikanthnetworked=\r\n@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;=\r\na rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; target=\r\n=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We=\r\ndnesday, 21 December 2011 2:19 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;S=\r\nubject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mahavidya experience&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\n&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv22887326h5&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;div=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;All,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If we take a Soumya (according to us) Devata like Sri La=\r\nlita Tripura Sundari, how do we correlate to the following verses from Lali=\r\ntha Sahasranaam:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot; Pancha Pretasanasina, Panch Brahmaswarupini&quot; The =\r\none who sits on 4 corpses etc&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;and &quot;Aparna Chandika Chanda Mundasura =\r\nNishudini&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my little sadhana I have done with Maha Vidyas, I foun=\r\nd that we are actually praying the spectrum and not the Specific Frequency =\r\nBand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soumya and Ugra are Gunas of human mind and are used by Mother=\r\n like a toy when she wants and throws it away and she is beyond Gunas. &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;The dream you had could be your minds projection too or it could be you=\r\nr psyche which is getting adjusted to her mantra and best way is to approac=\r\nh MOTHER with Utmost Love and Respect.

They bestow different aspects of Supreme Knowledge. &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;Worshipping them for winning a court case or getting a job (which many &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;people try to do today) is like trying to use a missile to crush an ant.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regarding your dream, it may be genuine or merely a projection of yo=\r\nur &lt;br&gt;mind. Remember that mind is very powerful and projects various consc=\r\nious &lt;br&gt;and sub-conscious conditioning as its experiences, especially in a=\r\n &lt;br&gt;dream.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you feel that the dream is a genuine experience of th=\r\ne devata, then &lt;br&gt;keep doing\n the mantra and see what happens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If y=\r\nou had the same experience with another mahavidya, it is possible &lt;br&gt;that =\r\nyour mind is just projecting. If your mind has affinity to a soumya &lt;br&gt;dev=\r\nata with certain nature, it may imagine whichever devata you worship &lt;br&gt;to=\r\n have that nature!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If your mind is imagining an Ugra devata as a ben=\r\nign smiling form, &lt;br&gt;perhaps you should stick to a Soumya Devata. If the d=\r\nevata really gives &lt;br&gt;you a darshan in a fierce form, is your mind capable=\r\n of handling it? If &lt;br&gt;your mind can visualize and perceive an Ugra Devata=\r\n in a truly fierce &lt;br&gt;form and yet feel deep love and surrender for her, t=\r\nhen only you are &lt;br&gt;suitable for such a sadhana.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good luck in your =\r\nsadhana!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;-----------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------&lt;br&gt;Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lesson=\r\ns, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and=\r\n Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a\n rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://ww=\r\nw.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Films that ma=\r\nke a difference: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://saras=\r\nwatifilms.org/&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spirituality: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;no=\r\nfollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdo=\r\nm&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jyotish writings: &lt;a r=\r\nel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyo=\r\ntishWritings&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twitter =\r\nID: @homam108&lt;br&gt;----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Hello,&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; One of the Mahavidyas I got a mantra fr=\r\nom an astrologer and did it &lt;br&gt;&gt; for 40 days, but with 5 days of&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; sadhana, it&#39;s was so cool , but got a real vison in dream of what they &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; call ugra devata , but Smiling&lt;br&gt;&gt; at me???
