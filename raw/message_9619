Rajarishi ji&#39;s advice is very good and I can probably add something whi=\r\nch might give much sooner releif. It would be great if the family can trave=\r\nl to Kasi.\n\nHowever right in Rochester(near to New york and Boston ) there =\r\nis a very powerful devi temple and the goddess is in the form of Sahasraksh=\r\ni . Haran Aiya who is the main priest of the temple is a disciple of Amrita=\r\nnanda natha saraswati and is he is very well versed in srividya upasana and=\r\n tantra. \n\nNarasimha Ji visited this temple a couple of years back and he p=\r\nosted his thoughts.Though the original message was about something else.\n\nh=\r\nttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/4624\n\n&quot;I truly appreciate=\r\n the sincerity of Haran aiya, his disciples and his lineage.\nI visited that=\r\n temple once and was impressed with the attitude of people running\nit.&quot;\n\nOn=\r\ne good example of the shakti of the sadhakas running the temple is this. Ev=\r\nery year they do a homa for Pratyangira Devi ( Atharvana Bhadrakali ) and t=\r\nhey use tons of chillies in the homa. Even though tons of chillies are used=\r\n in the homa people&#39;s eyes do not burn while standing since the tattwa of t=\r\nhe offering has been changed due to her grace.\n\nThe Sri Chakra Journal they=\r\n publish detailed it ...\n\nhttp://srividya.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/20=\r\n12-Blossom-16-Petal-2.pdf\n\n&quot;All in all, the entire homam took about 3 hours=\r\n to complete, with\nseveral kilograms of red chilli peppers being offered in=\r\nto the\nflames in the process. However, not one person felt the effect of th=\r\ne\nchilli smoke, as everything was accepted by the Devi.\nAfter the main homa=\r\nm,Bhairava bali was offered\noutside the temple and everyone was given the r=\r\nemaining (unburned)\nprasadam to take home.&quot;\n\nThe goddess in the form of Pra=\r\ntyangira devi is famous for turning back black magic and protecting her dev=\r\notees. This is the link and address to the temple.\n\nThe temple also houses =\r\na Bhairava Murthy and Aiya is well versed with Pratyangira sadhana. \n\nhttp:=\r\n//srividya.org/\n\nPlease take the child to the shrine and meet Haran Aiya an=\r\nd he will definetly suggest something more quicker.\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram K=\r\nishore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
