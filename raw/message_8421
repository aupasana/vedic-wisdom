A pranam mantra in the heart of a true sadhak is powerful an=\r\nd the universe shakes, while a bija mantra in the mouth of a idiot is power=\r\nless. Who beats what, and not all &#39;who&#39;s&quot; (in whoville) are equal. People t=\r\nhrow about all kinds of words and lay down the campy wisdom speak, but when=\r\n push comes to shove they often reveal themselves. Time is either a redeeme=\r\nr or a revealer.\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n\nOn=\r\ne should never come out of sadhana the same being that they went into it. T=\r\nhere is always more to give of yourself and there is always a greater depth=\r\n.\n\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n\nPeople don&#39;t fee=\r\nl this because they think they have time, but your going to be dead fairly =\r\nsoon. Then your going to flop around like a fish out of water when your ide=\r\nntity (you) gets crushed. A clever slogan or sly manipulation at this point=\r\n is meaningless. One is left with the (uncontrived) substance that is not u=\r\nnder the control of thought. Unless a sadhana hits upon the substantive nat=\r\nure (substance in terms of reality which in a way is insubstantial), then a=\r\nnything &quot;gathered&quot; is just more food for Death. Please understand that ther=\r\ne will be no choices. Now is the time of choice, and one can choose to go a=\r\nll out or one can be a typical lukewarm fetishist who never fully commits.\n=\r\n\n\nsome more hard knocks on that blog. wake up and get serious !!!\n\n\nregards=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vemparlaramkishore&quot; &lt;vemparlaram=\r\nkishore@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Nobody Ji\n&gt; \n&gt; Amazing messages all throughout.Many=\r\n Many thanks to you for providing that hard knock....If I may just add one =\r\nsmall message ( not that I have realized anything or that am doing any sadh=\r\nana properly ) .\n&gt; \n&gt; Just adding it in the hope it might help others....fo=\r\nr often many are asking sincerely &quot; How to love God &quot;.... Based purely on w=\r\nhat my Guru told me \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; How will you love something that you have no id=\r\nea about &quot;..Also\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;It is very easy to imagine loving somebody sitting w=\r\nay up in heaven with whom you have no interaction &quot;...It is much harder to =\r\nlove your neighbour....\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Forget about Divinity and its myriad theorie=\r\ns...One can aspire to it when one is atleast human &quot;..\n&gt; \n&gt; Narasimha Ji ha=\r\ns always said...the true measure of progress is when one is starting to get=\r\n a little less angry,little more compassionate...little more intense and li=\r\nttle more exuberant...\n&gt; \n&gt; It is not about the 20 mins of Homa...or your r=\r\nespective Kriyas/Meditations/Affirmations/Stotras...Defintely do that atlea=\r\nst but what matters most is how do you conduct rest of your day ?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; L=\r\noving god will only come when you truly start loving the people around you.=\r\n...That is the true test since now you have some skin in the game...all els=\r\ne is delusion...\n&gt; \n&gt; For eg: Jesus never said to Love god ...He always sai=\r\nd &quot;Love Thy Neighbour&quot; for :) it is the true test.....it is easy to love de=\r\nad people ...so hard to love a living person sitting right beside us.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nOne hating so many people ( one&#39;s bosses...ones relatives...various acquain=\r\ntances) ...even if he imagines he is loving God...it is but a delusion.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Anywaz Chota mooh badi baat...just wanted to say that out....\n&gt; \n&gt; Man=\r\ny Pranams\n&gt; \n&gt; Vemparla Ram Kishore\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, &quot;scsa_taker3&quot; &lt;scsa_taker3@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (Itna sannata kyun hai bh=\r\nai???)\n&gt; &gt; ( Please chant as much while reading this, chant ram, krishna,al=\r\nlah,\n&gt; &gt; wahe - guru,  or whatever name you so please, chant your mantra, b=\r\necause\n&gt; &gt; who knows when that heart attack comes )\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; How bad do you=\r\n want God????\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A modified version of a really popular audio. The mo=\r\ndified version\n&gt; &gt; applies a lot to us, fools lost in oblivion trying to le=\r\narn more and\n&gt; &gt; more and more theories instead of doing sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nQuoted with modifications pertaining to Mr God.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;There was a you=\r\nng man, you know, who wanted to reach god/be super\n&gt; &gt; siddha or something =\r\nand so he went to this guru. The guru was very very\n&gt; &gt; advanced, a legend =\r\nin his own right. And he told the guru you know I\n&gt; &gt; wanna be on the same =\r\nlevel you are and the guru said if you wanna be on\n&gt; &gt; the same level I&#39;m o=\r\nn, I&#39;ll met you tomorrow at the beach.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So the young man got there =\r\n4 A.M. he was  all ready to rock n&#39; roll.\n&gt; &gt; He was dressed properly, but =\r\nhe should have worn shorts. The old man\n&gt; &gt; grabs his hand and said: How ba=\r\nd do you wanna be successful (basically\n&gt; &gt; achieve god, have siddhi and th=\r\ne like, all references to success from\n&gt; &gt; hereon now mean uniting with god=\r\n) ? He said: &quot;Real bad&quot;. He\n&gt; &gt; said: Walk on out in the water. So he walks=\r\n out into the water. When he\n&gt; &gt; walks out to the water he goes waist deep =\r\nand goes like this old man is\n&gt; &gt; crazy.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The young man was thinkin=\r\ng , &quot;Hey I wanna meet god, achieve siddhi in my\n&gt; &gt; sadhana, get out of thi=\r\ns birth death cycle etc. etc. and this foolish\n&gt; &gt; old man got me out here =\r\nswimming. I didn&#39;t ask to be a lifeguard. I\n&gt; &gt; wanna meet god he got me in=\r\n water =96 so the old man said go on a\n&gt; &gt; little further =96 the young man=\r\n walked out a little further =96\n&gt; &gt; then the young man was neck deep in wa=\r\nter - the young man was thinking \n&gt; &gt; this old man is crazy =96 everybody c=\r\nalls him a paramhansa, a\n&gt; &gt; mahapurusha, god incarnate but he is definitel=\r\ny crazy. So the old man\n&gt; &gt; again said go on out a little further =96 the y=\r\noung man went out a\n&gt; &gt; little further, the water was now right at his mout=\r\nh =96the young man\n&gt; &gt; was now thinking of going back, this old hack is out=\r\n of his fucking\n&gt; &gt; mind. And then the old man said: &quot;I thought you said yo=\r\nu wanted to\n&gt; &gt; be successful?&quot; He said: &quot;I do.&quot; He said: &quot;Then walk a\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nlittle further.&quot; Then the old man followed this guy into the water,\n&gt; &gt; he =\r\ngrabbed the young man&#39;s head, and held him down underwater. The old\n&gt; &gt; guy=\r\n held the young man, till  the young man was about to pass out, the\n&gt; &gt; you=\r\nng guys arms were now splashing the water in desperation, then\n&gt; &gt; suddenly=\r\n the guru raised him up. He said: &quot;I got a question for\n&gt; &gt; you.&quot; He told t=\r\nhe young guy, he said: &quot;When you want to succeed\n&gt; &gt; as bad as you wanna br=\r\neathe than you will be successful.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; (Succeed =3D uniting with god, or s=\r\neeing god, or achieving supernatural\n&gt; &gt; powers, or siddhi, or whatever, th=\r\nats subjective, upto you.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know how many of you all got as=\r\nthma here in Vedic wisdom? If\n&gt; &gt; you ever had a asthma attack before, you =\r\nare short of breath S.O.B,due\n&gt; &gt; to shortness of breath, you start wheezin=\r\ng, &quot;hai, hai, hai&quot; like you\n&gt; &gt; have run 10,000kms in one go, the only thin=\r\ng you are trying to do at\n&gt; &gt; that moment during the attack, is get some ai=\r\nr. You don&#39;t care about\n&gt; &gt; no basketball game, you don&#39;t care about what&#39;s=\r\n on T.V., you\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t care about nobody calling you, you don&#39;t care about=\r\n a\n&gt; &gt; party. The only thing you care about when you trying to breathe is t=\r\no\n&gt; &gt; get some fresh air. That&#39;s it! And when you get to the point where\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; all you wanna do is be is successful as bad as you wanna breathe then\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n you will be successful. And I&#39;m here to tell you that number one,\n&gt; &gt; most=\r\n of you say you wanna be successful but you don&#39;t want it bad,\n&gt; &gt; you just=\r\n kind of want it. You don&#39;t want it bad than you wanna\n&gt; &gt; party. You don&#39;t=\r\n want it as much as you want to be cool. Most of you\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t want success=\r\n as much as you want sleep. &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;\n&gt; &gt; (Again Success =3D uniting with god,=\r\n or seeing god, or achieving\n&gt; &gt; supernatural powers, or siddhi, or whateve=\r\nr, thats subjective, upto\n&gt; &gt; you.)\n&gt; &gt; End Quote\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ignore the follo=\r\nwing video , focus on the audio in it. with the above\n&gt; &gt; modifications.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Dnw41UQU_J0A\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Do all of you remem=\r\nber that Visa call from your perspective\n&gt; &gt; embassies????\n&gt; &gt; Remember tho=\r\nse???\n&gt; &gt; The interviews???\n&gt; &gt; Even if you had slept at 4 in the morning, =\r\nthe night before, you would\n&gt; &gt; still wake up and be at the embassy office =\r\nat 7, or whenever your\n&gt; &gt; appointment was.\n&gt; &gt; Hell even if you had high f=\r\never 102 or something, you would still reach.\n&gt; &gt; Do you remember that flig=\r\nht to the states???\n&gt; &gt; Ohhhh Ammmerrriiiiicaaaaaaa!!!! You got up for that=\r\n flight even after\n&gt; &gt; like sleeping for 1 hour the night before. How????\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Or do you remember that fancy restaurant??? Yes the one you waited =\r\nfor 1\n&gt; &gt; hour, in heat , to get in , to have the tasty tikkas??? Mmmmmmmmm=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; tandoori chicken=85.. mmmmmm.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When was the last time you did=\r\n this for god????\n&gt; &gt; I see homams that last for 15 minutes. Sure enough 15=\r\n is better than\n&gt; &gt; zero, but still 15???\n&gt; &gt; You can spend hours on that s=\r\nuperbowl match, finding porn on the\n&gt; &gt; internet, downloading movies, watch=\r\ning youtube, sleeping, talking,\n&gt; &gt; bitching, gossiping, shopping, and when=\r\n it comes to god, you give 15\n&gt; &gt; minutes. Wah, wah!!!!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Surely si=\r\nre/ madame, god will be yours, yes, yes surely.

No matter if you periodically\n&gt; &gt; fail.\n&gt; &gt; Did you start ma=\r\nnaging your food intake????\n&gt; &gt; Did you start chanting the name of god as m=\r\nuch as you can even after\n&gt; &gt; reading this line a thousand times that death=\r\n is the ultimate reality\n&gt; &gt; and who knows when you die ????\n&gt; &gt; How many h=\r\nomams you did???Oh you dont have time do you?? But you seem to\n&gt; &gt; have tim=\r\ne for everything else in life.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Then what was the use for all =\r\nthe discussions because once your computer\n&gt; &gt; is switched off, nothing cha=\r\nnges in your life, your mind has made a\n&gt; &gt; fuddu out of you by foxing you =\r\ninto thinking, &quot;sir I have done something\n&gt; &gt; about my pitiable state.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Then you read Mr Nandy&#39;s post about the story of &quot;p&quot;, and say what an=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; eye opener, what excitement, what a story!!!!!! But errrrrr=85=85=85=\r\n=85\n&gt; &gt; what did you do post that???\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t see people shortening=\r\n their mall trips, their shopping sprees,\n&gt; &gt; their time on the internet bu=\r\nt when it comes to a homam, first question\n&gt; &gt; or thought is &quot;oh my gawd, i=\r\nt will take that long, let me ask Mr Rao of\n&gt; &gt; making it shorter.&quot; And god=\r\n is so magnanimous, he allows you to do so.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hell you spend more ti=\r\nme on buying your kacche, panty, banyan and bras\n&gt; &gt; rather than on god!!!!=\r\n!! Wah, wah, surely god will be yours.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Then you pick up books, all=\r\n sort of books read all about other guys\n&gt; &gt; reaching god, start reading in=\r\nto their experiences, start discussing\n&gt; &gt; about their high spiritual state=\r\ns and everything, and get lost  in\n&gt; &gt; arguing over those discussions. Then=\r\n post apologies, my goodness, the\n&gt; &gt; noise. Waste of a human birth, if you=\r\n were to see the line waiting for a\n&gt; &gt; human womb, and then realize &quot;I&quot; ha=\r\nve to stand at the end of this line,\n&gt; &gt; you would piss yourself. Some girl=\r\n after seeing it did, and has always\n&gt; &gt; been a little urgent with her sadh=\r\nana ever since then.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I see this question getting asked a lot, that=\r\n &quot;how do you find a\n&gt; &gt; guru????&quot;\n&gt; &gt; And you know everyone, wants a high p=\r\nowered one, not any other will do.\n&gt; &gt; See a high powered guru, also requir=\r\nes a good disciple.\n&gt; &gt; Are you good enough, honestly answer this??? Many w=\r\nill say no, many will\n&gt; &gt; say good or not, its the guru&#39;s job to deal with =\r\nit etc etc, but are you\n&gt; &gt; willing to work on yourself to spare the guru s=\r\nome work???? Why would a\n&gt; &gt; high powered one come and teach you??? only af=\r\nter your penance is good\n&gt; &gt; enough na? otherwise, he/she will be busy in h=\r\nis/her union with god.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now how bad do you want god?\n&gt; &gt; How b=\r\nad do you want a guru?\n&gt; &gt;   How bad do you want those spiritual states?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; How bad do you want the darsahn for your beloved?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t kind of =\r\nwant it, want it bad, time is running out, and very soon,\n&gt; &gt; another rebir=\r\nth, again the young age, again the teenage, again the\n&gt; &gt; affairs, again th=\r\ne hormone spikes, again the degrees, again the sucky\n&gt; &gt; jobs, again confus=\r\ned with life, again the financial nightmares, again\n&gt; &gt; the heart attacks ,=\r\n again the death, and again, again. Hai ram!!!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll end this post=\r\n with an example, a businessman in Delhi in the\n&gt; &gt; 1940&#39;s, had done a bit =\r\nof penance and you know was highly interested in\n&gt; &gt; god , shod and all thi=\r\ns stuff. So one day , he had gone to kerala, and\n&gt; &gt; met a guy who was proc=\r\nlaimed in the village to be equivalent to lord\n&gt; &gt; voldmeort or something b=\r\nut on the god side.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So the guy went to meet the guy whose name can=\r\n&#39;t be taken and asked him\n&gt; &gt; , i am looking for a guru, the old fella said=\r\n , for what exactly are you\n&gt; &gt; looking for a guru??? The business man said=\r\n, , you know to learn stuff.\n&gt; &gt; The old fellow said what are you willing t=\r\no do for your guru??? The\n&gt; &gt; businessman said anything. The old fella said=\r\n, okay take all your\n&gt; &gt; clothes off, the businessman was shocked. the suit=\r\n guy took them off\n&gt; &gt; reluctantly. then the old fella, told him , wear a p=\r\natta around your\n&gt; &gt; neck and roam around the town naked. The businessman w=\r\nas aghast, but the\n&gt; &gt; old fella, told him &quot;anything right???&quot;, the busines=\r\nsman very BADLY\n&gt; &gt; wanted a guru, so he went and got shoes thrown at him, =\r\ncame back after\n&gt; &gt; half an hour to find the old fella gone and his clothes=\r\n gone too. He sat\n&gt; &gt; there sobbing, and sobbing and cursing god, that i wa=\r\ns the biggest fool\n&gt; &gt; to come here and trust this man.
