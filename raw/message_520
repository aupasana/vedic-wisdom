It is incorrect to say that &quot;all of elder&#39;s punyas&quot; are transferred then=\r\n. So many people touch the head of youngsters with hand to bless. It is inc=\r\norrect to say that &quot;all of youngster&#39;s sins&quot; are transferred then.\n \nHoweve=\r\nr, this belief is not without a basis. When a person touches the feet of a =\r\nperson with awakened energy, *some* transfer of energy occurs automatically=\r\n, whether or not one is aware (that is why we have the tradition of touchin=\r\ng the feet of saints). However, how much energy gets transferred is depende=\r\nnt on the capabilities of the two persons, the strength of the desire in th=\r\ne two persons for (or against) the transfer and the previous rina between t=\r\nhe person.\n \nIt is not necessary to touch the feet of a person with the for=\r\nehead. It is possible to touch with hands and receive energy. Once one youn=\r\ng man came to my Jyotish class in Boston and touched my feet at the end to =\r\ntake blessings. Normally, when people to do that, I mentally say &quot;sarvam Sr=\r\ni Krishnarpanamastu&quot; and imagine that the obeisance is going to Lord Krishn=\r\na. But, this time, I could clearly feel some energy leaving me. It was a ve=\r\nry tangible feeling. This person touched specific spots in the two feet wit=\r\nh a specific mudra of the two hands.\n \nOf course, one can dismiss my feelin=\r\ng as a hallucination. But, when the same young man came to a Satya Narayana=\r\n vratam at my house later in the week and touched the feet of a very good p=\r\nriest who came from India (the same one who I said performed the first Chan=\r\ndi homam at my house, arranged for the shata Chandi homam in Chennai and ha=\r\nd books on homam gifted to us), he immediately exclaimed &quot;sir, we have to b=\r\ne careful with this boy! He seems to do some sadhana. He definitely knows h=\r\now to take away some energy from people.&quot; I had not told him what I had exp=\r\nerienced a few days back and this was his independent conclusion after the =\r\nsame experience as mine!\n \nI am convinced that some enegy give and take hap=\r\npens when feet and head are touched for blessings. However, it requires a c=\r\nertain level of ability and purity to receive energy from someone by touchi=\r\nng feet. So many people touched my feet. Only a handful gave me the feeling=\r\n that some energy left me.\n \nThere is another way to look at this. If a per=\r\nson gets something from me, it is probably because there is some rina. Why =\r\nshould I try to resist a payback of rina? Who are we anyway to give or to t=\r\nake? All the energy deposited in all the beings of this universe is Hers an=\r\nyway. Why should one look at the energy deposited in oneself as one&#39;s own?\n=\r\n \n*        *        *\n \nMy simple bottomline advice is this:\n \nIf someone p=\r\nays obeisance to you, let them do it. Do not feel proud or superior when so=\r\nmeone touches your feet. Think that Krishna (or Shiva) in him is paying obe=\r\nisance to Krishna (or Shiva) in you and offer it to Krishna (or Shiva). Whe=\r\nn you touch the feet of someone, feel humble and think that the person you =\r\nare bowing to is a limited manifestation of Krishna (or Shiva). Leave the r=\r\nest of the karma/energy calculations out and do not worry.\n \nAt the same ti=\r\nme, if someone does not let you touch his/her feet, just bow to them and pa=\r\ny obeisance in the mind without a physical touch. You can still feel humble=\r\n and think that the person you are bowing to is a limited manifestation of =\r\nKrishna (or Shiva).\n \nA lot of this is in the mind and controlling the mind=\r\n is the key.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicA=\r\nstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree J=\r\nyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish softw=\r\nare (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) we=\r\nbsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------- \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: vinaya=\r\nk tandle \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com ; sohamsa@yahoogroups.com \n  S=\r\nent: Sunday, October 05, 2008 10:51 AM\n  Subject: [vedic-wisdom] CHARAN SPA=\r\nRSH OBEISANCE\n\n\n        Adarniya Narasimha Guruji Namaste,\n\n        I had a=\r\nrranged for the first time Chandi Homam at my house on Friday.
