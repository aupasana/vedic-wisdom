Any India is familiar with the daily r=\r\nituals which serve as\n      reminders of the concept of pure and, therefore=\r\n, holy water.

Each day we learn of the increase in w=\r\nastelands and the\n      consequent effect upon rural life, be they the fore=\r\nsts of Bastar or the\n      hills of the Himalayan range. In the language of=\r\n Indian myth, this is the\n      rape of the tree and river goddess, the V=\r\n=A4k=C0ik=A1s,\n      and the destruction of the gods of the woods, the Vana=\r\ndevat=A1.\n      No wonder the Chipko Movement and Protect the Silent Valley=\r\n is a cry of\n      anguish.

The tragedy of Bhopal is too close for\n      comment, but e=\r\nqually demonic are the =A1suric chimneys of black t=A1masic\n      forces wh=\r\nich pollute the &#39;lungs&#39; of life. Acid rains are common elsewhere\n      and =\r\nman looks in vain for the purity of the water to flow from the\n      rain-f=\r\nilled clouds.

Noise pollution makes Man deaf to the inner voices\n=\r\n      of his wisdom.And so Man aspires higher\n      and higher, beyond the =\r\npollution of his making, to that one source which\n      sustains all and is=\r\n yet beyond his reach, namely, the Sun - =CBditya - the\n      giver of ligh=\r\nt in the sky and fire on earth - Agni - the source of energy\n      which ap=\r\npears unpollutable unlike the fuel of his making. This energy,\n      physic=\r\nally and metaphysically, is Man&#39;s only ray of hope for the\n      continuanc=\r\ne of life.\n\n\nThank you,\nManish\n\n\n\n\n      Add more friends to your messenger=\r\n and enjoy!

Destruction is writ large on the balmy skies,=\r\n once\n      azure blue, today smoke grey.&lt;o:p&gt;\n      &lt;/o:p&gt;\n      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/=\r\nfont&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n      &lt;h2&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; face=3D&quot;DV1-TTYogesh&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n =\r\n     &lt;/span&gt;Finally, we have polluted holy sound, the primeval Nada, throug=\r\nh\n      the chaos of our life. Noise pollution makes Man deaf to the inner =\r\nvoices\n      of his wisdom.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; face=3D&quot;DV1-=\r\nTTYogesh&quot;&gt;And so Man aspires higher\n      and higher, beyond the pollution =\r\nof his making, to that one source which\n      sustains all and is yet beyon=\r\nd his reach, namely, the Sun - =CBditya - the\n      giver of light in the s=\r\nky and fire on earth - Agni - the source of energy\n      which appears unpo=\r\nllutable unlike the fuel of his making. This energy,\n      physically and m=\r\netaphysically, is Man&#39;s only ray of hope for the\n      continuance of life.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you,&lt;br&gt;Manish&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n  =\r\n    &lt;!--2--&gt;&lt;hr size=3D1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; Unlimited freedom, unlimited storage. &lt;a hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://in.rd.yahoo.com/tagline_mail_2/*http://help.yahoo.com/l/in/yaho=\r\no/mail/yahoomail/tools/tools-08.html/&quot;&gt;Get it now&lt;/a&gt;\r\n--0-1116250405-1235736251=:36011--\r\n\n"}}
