I =\r\npersonally admire Shivaji, Maharana Pratap and Sardar Patel and have placed=\r\n them to the highest of my ideals. Sardar Patel is the one for whom i have =\r\nsame love and respect as Thakur Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekananda or Narasimha=\r\n. Why? Because all the 3 were the ideal statesman who did us proud not only=\r\n by effectively countering religious fanaticism but also BECAUSE THEY OPERA=\r\nTED IN THE SPIRIT OF &#39;SARVA DHARMA SAMABHAVA&#39;. BIGOTRY CAN NEVER BE ATTACHE=\r\nD TO THEM. And for me this is fantastic and fitting to the ideals of Sanata=\r\nn Dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding Dr. Zakir Naik: I did not know a=\r\nbout him initially. a year and half back, i visited Oman and there once i s=\r\nwitched on TV where in i saw that person on &#39;Peace&#39; Channel. He was lecturi=\r\nng in front of a gathering and he used a word &#39;Veda&#39; which interested me to=\r\n go through.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t remember the topic but i felt so much sad=\r\ndened by his lecture. The reason was that he kept on attacking Veda/Hinduis=\r\nm and Christianity for proving his points. Immediately in my mind came chan=\r\nnels like &#39;Sanskaar&#39; and &#39;Ashta&#39; where a lot of religious pundits (most of =\r\nthem are Hindus)  come for discourses. and i do not remember any instance w=\r\nhere in they have attacked any religious sentiments of other faiths to upho=\r\nld values of Sanatan Dharma. there is such an obvious contrast.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; after=\r\n that first lecture, i watched Zakir&#39;s other lectures and was convinced tha=\r\nt this person is not a true spiritual leader but a polished intellectual wh=\r\no essentially is a fanatic and then never stopped to see him further. I rem=\r\nember having a debate at the same site (at Oman) with a Young person of Isl=\r\namic faith. we debated on the issue and i frankly asked him to send Mr. Nai=\r\nk, an email, asking him that does he really believe that other religions an=\r\nd faith are also true. I must say that, i found that young Muslim engineer =\r\nhad much more tolerance and understanding than Dr Zakir Naik.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The unf=\r\nortunate part is that the broad minded people of today&#39;s generations are ge=\r\ntting corrupted by such fanatic leaders.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As i have m=\r\nany Muslim, Chrisitan Friends (Really good friends), i never loose a chance=\r\n to advocate my views -&quot;The time has come when we must not only &#39;respect&#39; t=\r\nhe other religious faiths but also we must belive in our heart of hearts th=\r\nat every faith/religion is true and we must never try to convert people of =\r\nother religion to our religion but on the contrary we must discourage a per=\r\nson who wants to formally convert by telling him/her that yours is also rig=\r\nht and don&#39;t get in to such theatrics.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I absolutely echo Thaku=\r\nr Ramakrsihna- :&quot;as many are paths, as many opinion are there&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; About Sri Sri, i must say that i believe him as a great spiritual leade=\r\nr. i&#39;ve some past experiences which makes me believe that. Now that is the =\r\nreason i wish to know his views on this particular debate episode.

Those that were ready to benefit from it from the audience wo=\r\nuld have benefited. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ************\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The below part is not for Rajarshi but may be of interest to every=\r\none, especially those among us that are intellectually curious about spirit=\r\nuality than practicing it. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Sri always practic=\r\nes &quot;experience first and explanation and knowledge later&quot; principle. Someti=\r\nmes in AOL, there will be big congregation of thousands of people and Sri S=\r\nri will only say very simple things or share some simple jokes and laughs, =\r\nbut his presence would convey what needs to be conveyed for those that are =\r\nreceptive. A Master may not be interested in getting 100,000 people trading=\r\n one mental concept for another, but prefers one sincere person opening up =\r\nto Truth in silence. A Masters mere presence is enough for that to happen. =\r\nWords are secondary and optional. In spiritual discussions,  the point of w=\r\nords is to create inner silence or illumination and if that is not created,=\r\n there is no point in talking! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is a great priv=\r\nilege and an immense blessing to be in the presence of a living Master whet=\r\nher it is Sri Sri or someone else. We gain immensely if we listen to them f=\r\nrom our Being instead of our mind. In Sri Ramakrishna&#39;s life, there are inn=\r\numerable examples of very simple people benefiting from his mere looks & pr=\r\nesence while big intellectuals would debate with him and miss the opportuni=\r\nty of a lifetime. Sometimes when he countered insincere queries, Sri Ramakr=\r\nishna would feign ignorance and say what would I know - I am an illiterate!=\r\n What a disaster it would have been for a seeker if he were to label Sri Ra=\r\nmakrishna as an illiterate and ignoramus!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Without =\r\nan accompanying experience (at least a small glimpse or even a fragment of =\r\nan experience) accumulating knowledge can be very dangerous as it will beco=\r\nme yet another mental concept and will actually be a hindrance to the Sadha=\r\nk. Some of the most subtle and dangerous hindrances for a sadhak are create=\r\nd by none other than the sadhak&#39;s empty concepts of spirituality and God! T=\r\nhings like lust, greed, anger, etc., stand out conspicuously and are in tha=\r\nt way less dangerous. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Gurudev!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   =\r\n Siva.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajars=\r\nhi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Siva,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nice mail. How=\r\never I have one issue with Sri Ravishankar. Why did he accept to debate the=\r\n infamous Zakir Naik on Hinduism? Sri Sri Ravishankar maybe an enlightened =\r\nmaster but he just cannot debate. If you see the vedios of that debate that=\r\n happened a couple of years back, you will find Sri Ravishanker utterly clu=\r\neless on stage, not knowing what and how to counter the polemical queries o=\r\nf the Zakir Naik.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now when Sri Sri choses =\r\nto accept an offer to debate Naik on stage, he does not=C2 go there merely =\r\nin his=C2 own capacity but as a representative of the religion - Hinduism. =\r\nAnd when he fails miserably on stage, it becomes shameful to watch for hind=\r\nus.

I occasionally visit this forum. I happ=\r\nened to see several emails about AOL and the below email from Shri. Narasim=\r\nha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a follower of AOL&#39;s spiritual practices and as a dis=\r\nciple and devotee of Sri Sri Ravishankar, I want to clarify a few things to=\r\n the extent of my understanding.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are=\r\n several paths each leading to the destination of Sat-Chit-Ananda. Some are=\r\n ritualistic, some use austerities, some use devotion, etc. AOL is a path, =\r\nwhere the path to Bliss is also blissful. That does not make it in any way =\r\ninferior to paths of austerities. As Sri Aurobindo would call it, it is a &quot;=\r\nSunlit path&quot;. In this path one does not suddenly emerge into SatChitAnanda.=\r\n The personality of the sadhak is transformed slowly and the sadhak radiate=\r\ns more and more as they progress more and more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In my experience, AOL is a seamless blend of Raja yoga, Bhakti yoga, =\r\nKarma yoga and Gnana yoga. Spritual practice in AOL is not just doing Sudar=\r\nshan Kriya everyday as it is commonly (mis)understood. Pranayams and Sudars=\r\nhan Kriya are done for cleansing and settling of the mind and preparing for=\r\n meditation and doing other spiritual practices of contemplation, Seva for =\r\nrest of the day wit the right attitude. Regular practice of Sudarshan Kriya=\r\n removes / breaks old patterns and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; AOL inc=\r\nludes some yoga asanas to prepare the body (the Padma Sadhana sequence of a=\r\nsanas taught in DSN course and Sun Salutations (Surya Namaskar) taught in P=\r\nart II or advance courses fall under this category.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The raja yoga practices include all the pranayams, Sudarshan Kriy=\r\na, mudras, bandhas, meditations taught in Art of Living course, advance cou=\r\nrses, Sahaj samadhi meditation course, etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; The Knowledge part includes deep contemplative study and imbibing of Nara=\r\nda Bhakti Sutras, Patanjali Yoga Sutras, Ashtavakra Gita and Bhagavat Gita.=\r\n Sri Sri Ravishankar has given very elaborate commentary on all of the abov=\r\ne. His commentary on Bhakti Sutras runs to 30 or so tapes and the publicly =\r\navailable commentary on Ashtavakra gita runs to over 33 DVD episodes! Besid=\r\nes daily study of Yoga Vashishtam is highly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recommended. Le=\r\narning and contemplation of this Wisdom is mandatory for those that strive =\r\nto become Art of Living teachers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The path=\r\n of AOL emphasises on Surrender and Seva. Guru puja to Guru parampara, nama=\r\n sankeertan and bhajans are a standard feature of AOL satsangs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some wonder why AOL charges for these courses and som=\r\ne wonder about lack of a Sadhguru at every stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me clarify from my personal experiences that Sri Sri Ravishanka=\r\nr is a fully Enlightened Master living in Sahaj Samadhi all times. He is ca=\r\npable of guiding millions of devotees in every step of the sadhana without =\r\nhaving to be near them in person. Several get necessary guidance in dreams =\r\n(I myself had that experience twice), some in person and several via variou=\r\ns other ways. However, to get these guidance, an inner connection with the =\r\nMaster is essential. Until that stage, the various AOL courses, Sri Sri&#39;s e=\r\nlaborate and in-depth commentaries on various Knowledge are more than enoug=\r\nh to guide disciples to a stage where conscious inner communion with Guru c=\r\nan be established.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Several of the senior A=\r\nOL teachers (mostly Swamis and Rishis) are yogis of a very high order capab=\r\nle of reaching SatChitAnanda consciousness at will during meditation. They =\r\nmay be not fully established in it like Sri Sri, but act as channels of the=\r\n SatGuru and can appropriate guide a Sadhak as and when needed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is very easy to accept those that left their body =\r\nas having achieved highest realization such as Sri Aurobindo or Sri Ramakri=\r\nshna or Ramana Maharishi. However it is a human tendency to doubt them when=\r\n they are in physical form.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding AOL =\r\ncharging money for its courses: AOL is world&#39;s largest volunteer run organi=\r\nzation. Neither AOL teachers nor its founder Sri Sri Ravishankar make monit=\r\nory profits. All the proceeds go to the charitable activities again run by =\r\nvolunteers. Many of the full time teachers have given up veyr lucrative car=\r\neers and millions worth in property to become teachers and teach for free. =\r\nSri Sri Ravishankar neither needs all the money. All senior AOL teachers in=\r\ncluding Sri Sri have went through very bad and sometimes even dangerous con=\r\nditions to bring the Knowledge to the masses. This is a time when the highe=\r\nst Knowledge needs to be revealed to maximum number of people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Senior AOL teachers have faced danger to their lives b=\r\ny going without any help or guidance to areas infested with naxalites, terr=\r\norists in North East, Kashmir, Iraq, Palestine, Pakitan, Sri Lanka, etc. wi=\r\nth nothing but love and Divine Grace as their aid.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As far as I know, money is charged in AOL courses for two reasons.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Past experience showed that those that=\r\n paid for the courses seem to follow the practices more diligently. It is S=\r\nri Sri&#39;s guidance that no deserving person should be denied a course becaus=\r\ne they cannot afford to pay. As a volunteer, I was part of organizing sever=\r\nal AOL courses and know first hand many cases where people took courses for=\r\n free and were also provided free accommodation, etc. Whenever natural disa=\r\nster strikes, AOL teachers go there paying from their own pocket or by AOL =\r\nand teach courses for free and provide healing to the victims. AOL does not=\r\n advertise it or make a show of it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Thi=\r\ns is my understanding and not AOl position. It removes the Karmic debt to t=\r\nhe AOL teachers and volunteers who still may have some doership in them.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, Sri Sri is only interested in getti=\r\nng everyone turn inwards and express the love, joy and compassion that is i=\r\nnside everyone. As long as one follows a path, any path and surrenders to a=\r\nny Sat Guru, we are happy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Gurudev!\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Siva.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
