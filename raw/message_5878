I =\r\nhad been doing a one lakh purascharana of Siva Pancakshari mantra that will=\r\n be completed the day before Maha Siva Ratri. I intend to do a Siva Homam a=\r\nnd offer the Dasamsa (10,000 offerings) in the homam. What material to be u=\r\nsed for a such a large number of offerings? Usually, I call several people =\r\nand divide the total number by the number of people chanting and offer the =\r\nquotient number of offerings in the fire. But this being a working day I do=\r\nn&#39;t think I will be getting any help. So, I will do the 10,000 swaha chanti=\r\nngs myself and I need to be doing 10,000 offerings. What is the best materi=\r\nal to be used. Ghee, Havan Samagri or any other seeds like sunflower seeds =\r\netc.? Please advise. \n\n2. For Siva Ratri, in our community at the local tem=\r\nple some people are organizing a Siva Homam wherein they are distributing S=\r\niva Lingas for sponsors ordered from some place in Delhi. I do not know the=\r\n origin well. It could well be from internet. After that homam is done and =\r\nI get the Siva Lingam, can I use it in my daily pooja or shall I put in the=\r\n show-case! \n\nOn the same topic, several people are afraid that something b=\r\nad would happen if they do not do abhishekam for the lingam daily, so they =\r\nare refraining from sponsoring the pooja. In  the process, the temple is su=\r\nffering with not enough funds. What would be your advise for such situation=\r\ns?\n\n3. Next month pournima is fast approaching and it is in the neighborhoo=\r\nd of March 18th. I don&#39;t know what to do for Mantapa danam yet. Could you p=\r\nlease advise?\n\nNagraj\n\n\n"}}
