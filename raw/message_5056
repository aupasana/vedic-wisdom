I finally got to read a little from it. I am impressed with this work.\n \nThe book is called &quot;Invading the Sacred: An Analysis of Hinduism Studies in America&quot; (editors: Krishnan Ramaswamy, Antonio de Nicolas and Aditi Banerjee). It has 29 scholarly articles organized in 4 sections.\n \nPerverted scholars with perverted anti-Hindu agendas that look down upon India and Hinduism with a colonial viewpoint have conducted perverted researches in the name of academic freedom at the religious studies departments of western universities, published them and gained name and fame, trampling the sacred in the process. Crying foul or getting frustrated with this will not improve the situation or solve the problem. Interested religious scholars have to firmly and patiently crtique these works in the same academic style, in order to reclaim the rightful place for Hinduism.\n \nSeveral papers in this book do exactly that. They take specific works by western scholars and rebut them quite well and show how they are fallacious, hasty, nonsensical or sometimes downright manipulative or filled with lies.\n \n*        *        *\n \nI will just give an example of the offensive work that was rebutted in this book. [Warning: Those who are sensitive to offensive writings should skip the next three paragraphs.]\n \nJeffrey Kripal from Univ of Chicago visited Ramakrishna Mission in West Bengal and did research on Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. Several people there enthusiastically helped him in the researches. In the end, what he produced is utterly nonsensical and filled with lies. He published his PhD dissertation without showing it to Ramakrishna Mission people to check for factual or linguistic inaccuracies. Ramakrishna mission people found out about what he produced only years later, after his book &quot;Kali&#39;s Child&quot; based on the PhD dissertation won great acclaim in the West. He won an award at the Americal Academy of Religion for that book, landed a job at Harvard and his book was sadly mentioned in the Encyclopedia Britannica as the *number one* choice for learning about Ramakrishna.\n \nIn the book, he portrayed Ramakrishna as a sexually perverted person, a homosexual and a pedophile. He did not know Bengali or Hindi or Sanskrit well and did not take help from any Bengali people at the Mission for this work. He used his own faulty translations, willful distortions and manipulation of sources to arrive at sensational (and damning) conclusions. For example, he translated a word that means &quot;lap&quot; as &quot;genitals&quot;, in the context of Swami Brahmananda (spiritual son of Ramakrishna and a young boy then) sitting in Ramakrishna&#39;s lap. He translated a word that means &quot;touching softly&quot; as &quot;uncontrollably rubbing sandalpaste on the penises of boys&quot;.\n \nEven in places where there was no material to mis-translate, he simply speculated! For example, he speculated on the meeting of Totapuri and Ramakrishna, in which the naaga sadhu (naked ascetic) Totapuri taught advaita vedanta to Ramakrishna and made him go beyond Mother Kali and experience nirvikalpa samadhi: &quot;What it must have been like for Ramakrishna, a homosexually oriented man, to be shut away for days in a small hut with another, stark-naked man. Vedanta instruction or not, it was this man&#39;s nudity, and more especially, his penis, that normally caught Ramakrishna&#39;s attention. How could it not?&quot; Please note that he is not referring to any source and mis-translating it, but simply speculating based on his perverted agenda!\n \n*        *        *\n \nIf you see the book, you will see many examples of such pseudo-scholarship driven by heinous agendas. It is a fact that many perverted people under asuric influences make their livelihood, money and fame lying and spreading falsehoods about Hinduism, Hindu deities and Hindu saints.\n \nThose who are not inclined to fight a dharma yuddha against this may ignore this and go on doing their sadhana. After all, if enough people do sadhana to strengthen sanatana dharma, this kind of things will automatically weaken. However, some scholars engaging these pseudo-scholars academically is really required on the ground. We need to give our encouragement to the pioneers who are doing this important scholarly rebuttal.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
