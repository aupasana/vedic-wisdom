With all =\r\nthe discussion going on fake gurus.. heres another view. \n\n&quot;Once Sri Chandr=\r\nasekhara Saraswati Swami of Kanchi Mutt (Sri Periyava) had camped in North =\r\nIndia. The then Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi, came to have His darsha=\r\nn.\n\nThe Prime Minister of India placed a similar question in front of Sri P=\r\neriyava, &quot;If you would pinpoint the persons who, in the name of spiritualit=\r\ny, lead the people in a wrong way I will take action against them.&quot; Sri Per=\r\niyava laughed and said, &quot;No! It should not be handled in this manner. Those=\r\n who approach such fake swamis will themselves, after a time, understand th=\r\neir standard of maturity.&quot;\n\nSri Periyava knew that this reply did not satis=\r\nfy Smt. Indira Gandhi. Someone had offered a basket full of mangoes to Peri=\r\nyava. It contained many unripe and a few ripe fruits. Many devotees waited =\r\noutside for Sri Periyava&#39;s darshan. Sri Periyava instructed the attendants =\r\nto bring a child from amongst these devotees. A child of about 5 years was =\r\nbrought to Him. Pointing to the basket Periyava smilingly said to the child=\r\n, &quot;Take whatever you want.&quot; After a search the child picked up a ripe fruit=\r\n.\n\nSri Periyava pointed out to Smt.Indira Gandhi who was watching this, &quot;Ju=\r\nst as the way a child knows what is ripe and what is unripe, so too would t=\r\nhose who go out in search of Truth recognize a true Mahan at some point of =\r\ntheir life.&quot;\n\nThanks\nShashi\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;m540i98&quot; =\r\n&lt;m540i98@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste S\n&gt; \n&gt; Very good post, you are very correc=\r\nt and I agree that if the sadhaka cultivates and becomes an uttama quality,=\r\n \n&gt; he or she will immediately see\n&gt; an uttama guru in his life directly gu=\r\niding him or her in physical body or in sooksma sharir i.e. astrally.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nThere is mention of fake guru in kakbhusundi ramayana, when lord rama\n&gt; was=\r\n ready to go back, it appears he librated all around him or and finally he =\r\nsends his servants to check if anyone is left out.\n&gt; To their surprise the =\r\nfind a dog, whose half body was decayed and other half there were many crea=\r\ntures sucking blood and eating flesh.\n&gt; \n&gt; They come back to Rama and share=\r\n the facts, and Rama indicates he as a guru in his past life and instead of=\r\n truely guiding his disciples he took their money and enjoyed life. So this=\r\n lifetime he has to pay back. \n&gt; \n&gt; The gist is fake gurus were present eve=\r\nn in Lord Ramas time too.\n&gt; Please pardon if there are some inaccuracies in=\r\n the description of the story, for accuracy I recommend others to read the =\r\nchapter in ramayana.\n&gt; \n&gt; We donot hear more as no one wrote about it. We d=\r\no see a lot now a days as we now live in internet age, both good and bad ne=\r\nws travel fast.\n&gt; \n&gt; On a different perspective, there is also need for gui=\r\ndance and help for those masses who are not uttama sishyas, and so since th=\r\ne time we live in and the time to come are different from the last 1000 yea=\r\nrs or the last 9000 years, I hope that god or guru shakti will manifest in =\r\na different way that is more effective to the time and the type and state o=\r\nf sadhakas that is going to come.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is the law of nature where we see=\r\n birth and then growth and then like a lamp towards the end the lamp shines=\r\n very brightly and then the light in the lamp goes out. In a similar way in=\r\n the past we have seen birth, growth, and then disappearance of  many sects=\r\n and spiritaul practices, we will see new ones coming out to suit more to t=\r\nhe time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards\n&gt; Mitesh\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, =\r\n&quot;S&quot; &lt;tejomaya101@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt;              =\r\n     I have to &#39;disagree&#39; with you here. The fact is that the uttama Guru a=\r\nppears to sadhakas of the same stature. In the present times, there is a sh=\r\nortage of such people. There are fewer uttama sishya and hence there is a s=\r\nhortage of uttama Gurus. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Again it is nothing new to say that God =\r\nmust be the Guru. This is how it has been and will be. Like the sastras say=\r\n - Guru, mantra and devatha are one and there should be no difference seen =\r\nbetween them. In the same way, the sastra say that the one who considers th=\r\ne physical being his Guru is not destined to succeed. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Even today =\r\nif a uttama Guru is born, He/She may want to attract only the uttama sishya=\r\n and not an adhama sishya. Unless one is that sishya, one will always see a=\r\n million defects in ones Guru- EVEN if he is a maha-siddha. The fault is in=\r\n the viewer. What to say of Guru, one can find fault in Devatha as well. Th=\r\ne problem is not with the Guru/Devatha, but with the viewer/sadhaka who is =\r\nstill subject to his/her own conditioning and the accumulated results of si=\r\nns acting on him/her. The Guru as well as the Devatha are eternal and our o=\r\nwn limited personalities are not. The &#39;dress&#39; the Guru wears ( His/Her own =\r\nlimited personality which He/She has mostly overcome) is also not permanent=\r\n. This is why the tantras say that Guru vakya is often more powerful than t=\r\nhe Guru.The vakya comes from the Devatha in the form of the Guru. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n The very fact that various tantras spend time in explaining Guru lakshanam=\r\n and sishya lakshanam is very revealing about how things have been for the =\r\npast few 1000 years at least.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Guru as well as the devatha are =\r\nnever external.                Our entire sadhana lies in realisation of th=\r\nis fact. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; People are led by their own karma to false Gurus. There =\r\nis little need to look at false Gurus and despair(may be not you, but as ma=\r\nny people are wont to). This is like looking at a bad husband or cheating w=\r\nife and believing that all husbands or wives are like that.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There =\r\nwere very clear indications about someone like Nityananda( whom I dont cond=\r\nemn for the particular aspect of having been unable to over come his human =\r\nweakness) being not a fit Guru. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; IMHO a sadhaka needs to be an exa=\r\nmple of how things or people could be in this world and provide an inspirat=\r\nion and a counter current even when things outside seem to be falling to bi=\r\nts.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My apologies if I have spoken any nonsense or caused any offen=\r\nse.I may have stated the obvious in  many different ways or alluded to thin=\r\ngs without addressing them. I do not say &#39;dont do any sadhana and keep sear=\r\nching for a Guru for ever&#39;; but I do not agree with giving up without searc=\r\nhing. I am sure anyone with a good Guru will understand what I say. All cor=\r\nrect things are Her grace and all nonsense that of my limited ago.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; S\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; But in the times to come, the idea of running after a guru\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wil=\r\nl change. Each one must take God as his/her guru and keep\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doing sad=\r\nhana and Nature will teach in the best possible way.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I know o=\r\nne person with spiritual inclination who went on a long pilgrimage visiting=\r\n many temples and ashrams in India. He was hoping that he would meet a real=\r\nized master who would bless him and give him a big push spiritually. He was=\r\n an old classmate of Manish and Manish was telling him from the beginning t=\r\nhat he would not find anyone like that. Manish told him to just sit at home=\r\n and do intense sadhana - homam, japam etc. But still that person wanted to=\r\n go around in search of a guru who would lift him. No need to say he did no=\r\nt find anyone like that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; We=\r\n indeed had spiritual masters in the past who were capable of lifting peopl=\r\ne just like that. However, such masters are rare today. In fact, Paramahans=\r\na Yogananda said that great masters will no longer descend to earth in comi=\r\nng years. I interpret what he said slightly differently. Some great masters=\r\n may still descend to earth in future, but they may not act like the sadgur=\r\nus of past. They may only show the (a) path and leave responsibility in the=\r\n hands of people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Why should it be so?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The age =\r\nof fake swamis and babas who are secretly after name and money has dawned (=\r\nor will soon dawn) on earth. They will pretend to be realized masters thoug=\r\nh they are not. They will be difficult to discern. This is going to render =\r\nfutile for many the search for a sadguru to whom one can completely surrend=\r\ner. In the old days, if you found a sadguru, surrendered to him/her and fol=\r\nlowed his/her commands blindly, your life would be made and you would achie=\r\nve whatever was meant to be achieved spiritually in that life. However, the=\r\n same cannot be said about following a fake guru blindly. In an age when th=\r\nere are probably going to be far more fake gurus than sadgurus, isn&#39;t it ad=\r\nvisable to rewrite the blueprint of a spiritual journey? Instead of searchi=\r\nng for a sadguru and surrendering to him, it may be better for most seekers=\r\n to just do sadhana and take God or Fire as guru as Rajarshi wisely said.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The old thinking will slowly be replaced by a new model approp=\r\nriate for the new times. What Paramahansa Yogananda said is along the same =\r\nlines. More developments in future may re-inforce the new approach.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Paramahansa Yogananda said that gr=\r\neat masters will not descend to earth in future. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa sa=\r\nid that he would be back after about 100 years accompanied by others who ac=\r\ncompanied him earlier and that many people would be liberated en masse this=\r\n time. How do we reconcile?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Quite possibly, Ramakrishna will =\r\nnot do any miracles or touch people and grant them liberation just like tha=\r\nt, but he will probably show them how to find god. He will not take them to=\r\n god himself, but point them to a path that will lead to god. He will proba=\r\nbly inspire many people to do intense sadhana and become liberated.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the old days, we had brave ksha=\r\ntriyas who were very dharmik and unselfish. It made sense to put power comp=\r\nletely and unconditionally in their hands. It worked for the benefit of all=\r\n. As such kshatriyas became rare and world started to be dominated by adhar=\r\nmik and selfish seekers of power, Nature adjusted the course of humanity an=\r\nd most of the world is today based on the concept of democracy or switching=\r\n to it slowly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In spiritual matters also, we had learned braa=\r\nhmanas who were very dharmik, unselfish and liberated. it made sense to pla=\r\nce people&#39;s spiritual lives completely and unconditionally in their hands. =\r\nAs such braahmanas become rare and world starts to be dominated by adharmik=\r\n and selfish possessors of knowledge (who are still in the web of Maayaa), =\r\nNature may adjust the course of humanity and redefine religion and spiritua=\r\nl progress based on more relevant concepts and ideas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *      =\r\n  *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The bottomline: If you like a guru or his teachi=\r\nngs, benefit from them. But do not worry about finding a sadguru as given i=\r\nn some scriptures and just keep doing sadhana. Surrender to god, do homam/j=\r\napam etc and wait patiently. It is a more fruitful method than to search fo=\r\nr a sadguru who will lift you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  =\r\n                 http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;      Films that make =\r\na difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;      Spirituality: http://gro=\r\nups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.ya=\r\nhoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@=\r\n&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I too believe we should give t=\r\nhe benefit of doubt to Swami Nityananda. There are some questions one has t=\r\no ask here:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) How reliable is vedio. Tehelka, which did =\r\nthe sting operation, is a VERY questionable organization.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n 2) Second, how does one know whether Swami Nityananda was not practising s=\r\nay some sexual ritual?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3) What exactly is the big fuss if=\r\n a Swami, and a reasonable good one, has sex with someone?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; We live in such times where Mahamaya has made it almost impossible for ev=\r\nen VERY advanced souls to remain perfect brahmacharis from birth till death=\r\n. Souls who might have been brahmacharis in all previous births, would prob=\r\nably not be able to remain so when born in thid age is a simple fact of nat=\r\nure, otherwise how else is Kali Yuga to be different from other yugas? She =\r\nwants it that way and so it is that way.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Further, in this=\r\n age of Kali the karmas and rnas have become so twisted and complex that un=\r\ntill you pay back the rnas, it will keep hounding you. How is one going to =\r\novercome that? Our society too is steeped in unnecessary prudishness and mi=\r\nsconceptions about lust and spirituality. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All said and d=\r\none, Vimalanada - whom I consider to be one of the greatest Saints who live=\r\nd - took 6 years of struggle to overcome lust. What to speak of ordianry sa=\r\ndhus and saints?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And finally, it is q&#92;uite possible that =\r\nSwami Nityananda *maybe* a fake guru. We do not know. But in the times to c=\r\nome, the idea of running after a guru will change. Each one must take God a=\r\ns his/her guru and keep doing sadhana and Nature will teach in the best pos=\r\nsible way. In this regard, fire can act as an excellent guru if one keeps d=\r\noing homas for some years. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Between me and You, there is only me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Take away th=\r\ne me, so only You remain&quot; - Hallaj\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 4/3/10, Nar=\r\nasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste KK,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nNo matter how genuine the video may look, let us give the benefit of doubt =\r\nto Paramahamsa Nithyananda and not jump to conclusions as someone said.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Even if* his expose on video is genui=\r\nne, it is only a reminder that nobody is free from Mahamaya&#39;s web.

Irrespective of his weaknesses that may have bee=\r\nn exposed now, he is clearly a man of excellent knowledge and rare wisdom. =\r\nWho is to tell how *we* will fare when our time comes for a test?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No matter how much one has read, no matter how much one has underst=\r\nood, no matter how much sadhana one has done, no matter how many good karma=\r\ns one has done, no matter what spiritual experiences one had, no matter how=\r\n blissful one feels during meditation or most of the time, no matter how el=\r\nevated one is spiritually, one can still fall. Take your mind off god for a=\r\n second and you CAN fall. When we are not in a state where mind is focused =\r\non god 24x7, we are vulnerable to a fall.

There may be some members of this group who make good progress in the com=\r\ning years and people around them may start noticing their purity and treati=\r\nng them specially. The key is to not be swayed by name, fame, image, follow=\r\ning, respect, money etc and retain the mindset of a dedicated servant, in t=\r\nhe midst of either adulation or adversity. If one allows self-consciousness=\r\n, ego and pride to take root in one&#39;s mind, one thing leads to another and =\r\none falls in the web of Mahamaya.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; E=\r\nven if a spiritual master really had weaknesses and fell, we do not benefit=\r\n whatsoever by discussing those weaknesses. If we instead discuss his teach=\r\nings, we may still benefit. A blue sky does not suddenly become green if th=\r\ne greatest liar says sky is blue. Similarly, spiritual truths do not become=\r\n invalid if a person who taught them fell.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps an increase of dharma is not possible without exposing and =\r\nweeding out some adharma, atleast in key places.

Her ways are definitely inscrutable.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free=\r\n Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals=\r\n for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAst rologer.org=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; S=\r\npirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish =\r\nwritings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --------=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -=\r\n--- krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@yahoo. com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri nar=\r\nasimha Garu,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For the last few days there are so many S=\r\nex scandals by the so called (famous and infamous) spiritual Guru&#39;s like Ni=\r\nthyananda swami, Kalki Bhagwan etc etc are being exposed to the masses. \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is there any relationship with these incidents with the =\r\nestablishment of the Dharma as you keep saying in the upcoming years?
