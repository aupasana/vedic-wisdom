Now realise\nthe=\r\nm. You have done enough study and reasoning. Now do some\nspiritual practice=\r\n. First  take up that aspect of  God  which appeals to\nyou most. Follow you=\r\nr own path of  Sadhana. When you realise  God\nthrough it, you will  feel th=\r\ne  joy of  realising Him also  in  other \naspects and through other paths.\n=\r\nOne should meditate on the form of the Ishtam  along with  Japam. \nOtherwis=\r\ne  Japam  does  not become effective. If  you cannot think of\nthe whole  fo=\r\nrm, think only of a part. Begin your meditation on the\n&quot;lotus feet&quot; of the =\r\n Deity.Continue to do it  even if you fail  in the\nbeginning. Why should yo=\r\nu stop until you succeed? Succeed you must.\nPractice will make everything e=\r\nasy.\nIs  meditation  an easy  affair?  Remember, it  is  next only to\nSamad=\r\nhi. Try to leave everything to the Lord, Resign yourself wholly\nunto Him. T=\r\nhen, through  your  Sadhana, self-surrender  and  everything \nwill come fro=\r\nm within.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                          =\r\n -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
