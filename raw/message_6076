It ha=\r\ns become legendary since 1996, and is often cited as one of the first paper=\r\ns in history documenting anti-Hindu bias in academia, as well as leading to=\r\n the global movement against anti-Hindu bigotry.\n\n\n&quot;Word As Weapon: The Mis=\r\nuse of Terminology in the Study of Hinduism&quot;\n\nBy Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acha=\r\nrya\n\n\n&quot;The term &#39;Sanatana Dharma&#39; more accurately communicates the axiomati=\r\nc\nmetaphysical nature of this concept than do the less meaningful and conco=\r\ncted terms &#39;Hindu/Hinduism&#39;. Thus, when the terms &#39;Hindu/Hinduism&#39; are repe=\r\natedly used by both Euro-American and Indian scholars, as well as by actual=\r\n followers of this eternal spiritual tradition, we fall very far short from=\r\n fully communicating the metaphysical, ethical and ontological components o=\r\nf the world-view of Sanatana Dharma. The former term =96 i.e., &#39;Hinduism&#39; -=\r\n is a word\nmistakenly created to describe a culture in a purely ethnic, nat=\r\nional and social context. The latter =96 &#39;Sanatana Dharma&#39; - is describing =\r\nan illustrious science of Being in a purely philosophical - and therefore h=\r\nighly rational, and inherently beautiful - sense. It is understandable that=\r\n the terms &#39;Hindu/Hinduism&#39; will continue to be used periodically as a matt=\r\ner of convenience. After all, it takes time, coupled with continuous educat=\r\nion, for people to break themselves of a two hundred year old habit. For th=\r\ne sake of accuracy, as well as to uphold the dignity, beauty and grandeur o=\r\nf our ancient\nand sacred religion, however, we must always do our utmost to=\r\n use the much more meaningful, linguistically correct and beautiful name Sa=\r\nnatana Dharma when referring to our religion. Our religion is Sanatana Dhar=\r\nma.\n\nThe use of inaccurate, and often consciously and maliciously distorted=\r\n, terminology has been a double-edged source of oppressive discourse. The u=\r\nse of such terms has been made use of by an intellectually lethargic tradit=\r\nion of South Asian scholars who view the religion of Sanatana Dharma, not a=\r\ns the noble living tradition that it is, but as their personal academic pla=\r\nything. On the other hand, Hindus themselves have then blindly accepted the=\r\nse non-indigenous and inaccurate terms, and unknowingly adopted them as the=\r\nir own. Thus, while the bulk of the blame must be placed squarely on the sh=\r\noulders of the oppressors, the victims too need to free themselves of a col=\r\nonialist-induced mentality of inferiority and acceptance of their oppressio=\r\nn. It is my fervent hope that we\nfollowers of Sanatana Dharma will stop usi=\r\nng the terminology of our antagonists to describe our religion. We must beg=\r\nin to call our religion by its true name: Sanatana Dharma. We must never us=\r\ne the words &#39;idol&#39; and &#39;mythology&#39; to describe, respectively, our murtis an=\r\nd sacred stories again. We must reclaim our heritage. Such positive change =\r\nmight come about slowly, one person at a time. Every revolution, however, b=\r\negins with thoroughly grasping the power of the word....&quot;\n\n\nVISIT HERE TO R=\r\nEAD THE REST OF THIS GROUND-BREAKING ARTICLE:\n\nhttp://www.dharmacentral.com=\r\n/forum/content.php?26-Word-As-Weapon\n\n\nPlease forward this information to a=\r\nll sincere spiritual seekers.\n\n\nAum Tat Sat\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
