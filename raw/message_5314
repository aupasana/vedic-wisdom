I have not studied biology or chemistry. So from layman&#39;s point of vi=\r\new, i have understood from what others are telling \n\n1) meat especially clo=\r\ngs the arteries and sexual reproduction in men is dependent on movement of =\r\nblood. So not only heart that is affected in non veg eaters but also sexual=\r\n reproduction system. this is surprising since non veg foods are supposed t=\r\no make men more rajasic and active. \n\n2) for the last 10 years at least the=\r\n chemicals are being used increasingly to make the animals more heavier and=\r\n tasty after cooking. accordingly even fish, prawns, chickens, goats, buffa=\r\nlo are all being fed with food that would make them grow faster and to make=\r\n their flesh tastier.\n\n3) people all over the world are ignoring such facts=\r\n to their own peril.\n\nI am a born vegetarian and i do not know the facts ab=\r\nout non veg foods.\n\nCan someone explain the facts?\n\nThanks to everyone,\nRaj=\r\nmohan \n\n\n"}}
