Like other \njigyasu, i too have several questions that books usu=\r\nally don&#39;t \nclarify much about. You have already mentioned the importance o=\r\nf \nhaving pure heart,honesty of jaap and concentration on deity; and \nnothi=\r\nng else really matters, but I am eager to learn few gaun things \nthat goes =\r\naround the jaap procedure for me and others benefit.\n  \n  What is the need =\r\nfor utkilan of a mantra? if mantra and sound(or \nany akshar in varnamala) h=\r\nave its own energy to begin with. What is \nthe effect of doing it or not do=\r\ning it? Its been said that sadashiva \nhas locked *all* mantras,is it symbol=\r\nic? Does by all it meant *all* \nor just the mantras of 5 lower categories? =\r\nLots of people are \nsuggesting they have had some signals of progress, how =\r\nis that \npossible when mantras have been locked?\n\n  What additional benefit=\r\ns a sadhak may get by following proper \nprocedure (viz aachaman,aangnyas, k=\r\narnyas,dikbandh,sankalp, stuti, \nmantra utkilan, mantra jap,homa, kshamapra=\r\nrthana (not sure about \norder and steps?)). What are the gotchas and negati=\r\nve effects if not \nfollowed properly. what was the original intent of rishi=\r\n-munis to \nfollow/recommend a proper procedure? \n\n What is the reason behin=\r\nd Mantra jaap performing on one place with a \nparticular pose? Scores of pe=\r\nople now chant/listen to mantra cds \nwhile driving? What are the effects of=\r\n such?\n\n What is the significance of Yantra? What is the significance of \nm=\r\naking yantra following particular sequence in drawing it? Theres \nbeen lots=\r\n of emphasis given to chant mantra infront of deity&#39;s \nyantra. I have also =\r\nread about yantra construction to be made in \ncertain order (viz lines have=\r\n to be erected in certain order) for it \nbe qualified as yantra for a deity=\r\n. Now a days there are premade \n(possibly pressed) copper yantras can be bo=\r\nught from merchants. What \neffect can it carry(or not carry). What is the p=\r\nossible test to \nidentify if a yantra is praan prathistit?\n\n Does the # of =\r\nwords/letters of a mantra matters? Or should a \npossible addition/removal o=\r\nf a bijakshar be performed before using \nit? Any mantra chant (or even ever=\r\ny sentance spoken/written) is said \nto really move energy from one point to=\r\n the other. Sri Sanjay Rath ji \nmentioned this process as the # of words in=\r\n mantra would identify \nsource house of the chart and # of letters would id=\r\nentify destination \nhouse of the chart for energy movement. what # of words=\r\n/letters in \nmantra are not advisable? \n\n Should a person look for a mantra=\r\ns that are more fruitful to that \nperson? There are elaborate suitable mant=\r\nra identification mechanisms \nthat helps a person identify a more fruitful =\r\nmantra (to him/her), and \neven mantras one should not attempt. Should such =\r\npath not be chosen? \nif getting closer to god is the key, and each person m=\r\nay have several \nleads in several births, why not pick the route that is/ar=\r\ne optimal?\n\n How do we identify correct laya of a mantra. should every mant=\r\nra be \npronounced in certain laya (intonation?) as hinted in chaanda (am i =\r\n\ncorrect?). You also have a humming of sri gayatri mantra at your \nwebsite.=\r\n Is this have to do with resonance of deity to the laya? \nThere are some ot=\r\nher mp3s of gayatri that use some other laya \n(http://www.omkarananda-ashra=\r\nm.net/audio5.html) . how does laya of a \nmantra effects overall? Also, ther=\r\ne are several mantra mp3 exists on \nweb where pronouncer robotically reads =\r\na mantra, how good is that? is \nsuch plain reading of a mantra a good start=\r\n? Or there is a generic \nlaya that goes with anustup chaanda (most mantra f=\r\nollows this \nchannda?) that you may advise, and possibly give a generic hum=\r\n for us \nto follow?\n \n Can you please post an easy,generic (but coverall) k=\r\nshama prarthana \nin sanskrit? \n\n Is there a possibiltiy for you to post a f=\r\null video of full \nprocedure of satyanarayan puja/homam of a somya devta et=\r\nc? \n\n Your help is most welcome! and thanks for everything.\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n"}}
