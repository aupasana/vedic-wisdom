I know he may not be able to get to reply soon, hence my attempt.\nOn Homas :\n      Firstly, As one does homa regularly, especially Chandi or Bhairava, one&#39;s apaana may go up during the initial period of saadhana. When this happens, one may experience digestive problems. Apaana is that vaayu in the gross body which expels the food that is rejected by the body. \n      As one&#39;s saadhana progresses and evolves spiritually, one&#39;s apaana may go down and have the urge for a bowel movement.\n      Secondly, if you are doing homa after having your meal, light or heavy, you can experience digestive problems. (I know someone who tried this and concluded it to be a terrible idea).  When you do homa with your stomach filled, the fire that is generated internally will be diverted for the use of your food digestion. It is not serving it&#39;s actual purpose, ie burn karmas, remove impurities and purify one. So, that&#39;s why in the manual it is advised to not start your homa until after 2 hours of food intake. It may be actually best to do homa when you are really very hungry. \n      I hope you do not fall into the second section.\n\n On fructivorous diet and suitable food for Homas :\n      Our body adjusts to what we get it used to. If one eats one chapati every night, after few weeks, two chapatis may seem an overkill. If one sleeps for 4 hours for few weeks, one may get used to the same. If you are able to get the proper nutrients with your food, then it does not matter whether you are eating fruits only or chapatis or a cup of milk and few fruits at night. Fruits, especially that contain fiber, help one digest the food easily. Give some time for your body to digest the food before you go to bed. Try to eat as saatvik food as possible. It definitely helps in one&#39;s spritual progress.\n \nOm suragarave namah\nRavi\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\nFrom: rajarshi14 &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Thursday, March 12, 2009 12:51:40 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Food habits\n\n\nNamaste\n\nI have been doing regular homas for the last six months.
