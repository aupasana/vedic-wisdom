Narasimha&#39;=\r\ns procedure as well).\n \nYou are right - there are different traditions. I t=\r\noo have not seen the installation of dik-palakas as part of Mahaganapathi h=\r\nomam before. As you said, we pray to dikpalakas on the 8 or 10 corners of h=\r\noma kundam as a part of every homa, but installing them before the homa is =\r\nnew.\n \nHowever, installation of dikpalakas happens traditionally in some ot=\r\nher homas such as Chandi homam. In a traditional Chandi homam, we install t=\r\nens of deities including the ten dikpalakas, in separate kalashas on a big =\r\npeetham before starting the homam. They are arranged in a specific way on a=\r\n specific yantra drawn on rice with turmeric and vermilion. We pray to them=\r\n and then do the fire ritual.\n \nThough I know that I will ruffle some feath=\r\ners with this, I must make a related point. The point of a homam is to call=\r\n deities in fire (as fire is a purer and better medium to host their energy=\r\n than an idol or a water pot) and offer mantras. Though there is some proce=\r\ndure before starting fire, care should taken so that one spends a majority =\r\nof the time worshipping in fire. That is the basic idea of a homam. While s=\r\nome priests do that, I have seen some who miss the point and do a lot of th=\r\ne procedure before starting the fire and spend a minimal time with the fire=\r\n. For the best results, maximize the time your spend with fire and offer mo=\r\nre and more mantra to the deity in fire.\n \n&gt; In my native place, the tradit=\r\nional homa only takes half that time,\n&gt; and it is not due to shortcuts.\n \nI=\r\nndia&#39;s Kerala state (aren&#39;t you from there?) used to have a community of le=\r\narned Brahmanas who would do an half hour Ganapathi homam every morning bef=\r\nore leaving the house. What a great sadhana! Even if one is carrying a lot =\r\nof bad karmas, such a powerful sadhana will eventually free one. Hopefully,=\r\n such a community - spread across the entire world - will be created in the=\r\n next 100 years.\n \nThis is Kali yuga. Bad karmas are accumulated very quick=\r\nly. Even a pure soul who took birth with very few bad karmas accumulates en=\r\nough of them by the age of 20 that it takes heavy sadhana thereafter to bur=\r\nn them! Then what of those who are *born* with many bad karmas?\n \nWhether y=\r\nou do homam or something else, spiritual sadhana to burn karmas and overcom=\r\ne ego is a must for every thinking human being. Use the human birth to do y=\r\nour dharma, purify yourself and overcome ego. Kali does everything to make =\r\nyou forget your dharma, add impurities to your system and feed your ego fur=\r\nther. That is the nature of Kali.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n---------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------\nDo Ganapathi Homam Your=\r\nself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nSpirituality: http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home=\r\n.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.or=\r\ng\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n---------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\n \n&gt; namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; So as per me this is the correct procedure to perform Shri Ganapthy Homa=\r\nm.So why we have to cut short the methods ?\n&gt; \n&gt; I believe this is answered=\r\n in misconception #2 (found on page 4 of Sri\n&gt; Narasimha&#39;s document).\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nTraditions are different in different places of the country.
