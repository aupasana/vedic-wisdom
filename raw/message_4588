Then you will be so again. But\nas the body is illusion then the ill=\r\nusion will repeat itself and keep on\nrepeating itself until you find the re=\r\nal Self.\n\nQuestion: What is death and what is birth?\n\nBhagavan: Only the bo=\r\ndy has death and birth, and it (the body) is illusion.\nThere is, in Reality=\r\n, neither birth nor death.\n\nQuestion: How much time may elapse between deat=\r\nh and rebirth?\n\nBhagavan: Perhaps one is reborn within a year, three years =\r\nor thousands of\nyears. Who can say? Anyway what is time? Time does not exis=\r\nt.\n\nQuestion: Why have we no memory of past lives?\n\nBhagavan: Memory is a f=\r\naculty of the mind and part of the illusion. Why do\nyou want to remember ot=\r\nher lives that are also illusions? If you abide\nwithin the Self, there is n=\r\no past or future and not even a present since the\nSelf is out of time - tim=\r\neless.\n\n\nQuestion: Are the world, the mind, ego and the body all the same t=\r\nhing?\n\nBhagavan: Yes. They are one and the same thing. The mind and the ego=\r\n are one\nthing, but there is no word to explain this. You see, the world ca=\r\nnnot exist\nwithout the mind, the mind cannot exist without what we call the=\r\n ego\n(itself, really) and the ego cannot exist without a body.\n\nQuestion: T=\r\nhen when we leave this body, that is when the ego leaves it, will\nit (the e=\r\ngo) immediately grasp another body?\n\nBhagavan: Oh, yes, it must. It cannot =\r\nexist without a body.\n\nQuestion: What sort of a body will it grasp then?\n\nB=\r\nhagavan: Either a physical body or a subtle-mental body.\n\nQuestion: Do you =\r\ncall this present physical body the gross body?\n\nBhagavan: Only to distingu=\r\nish it - to set it apart in conversation. It is\nreally a subtle-mental body=\r\n also.\n\nQuestion: What causes us to be reborn?\n\nBhagavan: Desires. Your unf=\r\nulfilled desires bring you back. And in each case\n- in each body - as your =\r\ndesires are fulfilled, you create new ones. You\nmust conquer desire to be a=\r\nbsorbed into the One and thus end rebirth.\n\nQuestion: Can sex change in reb=\r\nirth?\n\nBhagavan: Oh, surely. We have all been both sexes many times.\n\nQuest=\r\nion: Is it possible to sin?\n\nBhagavan: Having a body, which creates illusio=\r\nn, is the only sin, and the\nbody is our only hell. But it is right that we =\r\nobserve moral laws. The\ndiscussion of sin is too difficult for a few lines.=\r\n\n\nQuestion: Does one who has realized the Self lose the sense of &#39;I&#39;?\n\nBhag=\r\navan: Absolutely.\n\nQuestion: Then to you there is no difference between you=\r\nrself and myself,\nthat man over there, my servant - are all the same?\n\nBhag=\r\navan: All are the same, including those monkeys.\n\nQuestion: But the monkeys=\r\n are not people. Are they not different?\n\nBhagavan: They are exactly the sa=\r\nme as people. All creatures are the same in\nOne Consciousness.\n\nQuestion: D=\r\no we lose our individuality when we merge into the Self?\n\nBhagavan: There i=\r\ns no individuality in the Self. The Self is One - Supreme.\n\nQuestion: Then =\r\nindividuality and identity are lost?\n\nBhagavan: You don&#39;t retain them in de=\r\nep sleep, do you?\n\nQuestion: But we retain them from one birth to another, =\r\ndon&#39;t we?\n\nBhagavan: Oh, yes. The &#39;I&#39; thought (the ego) will recur again, o=\r\nnly each\ntime you identify with it a different body and different surroundi=\r\nngs around\nthe body. The effects of past acts (karma) will continue to cont=\r\nrol the new\nbody just as they did the old one. It is karma that has given y=\r\nou this\nparticular body and placed it in a particular family, race, sex,\nsu=\r\nrroundings and so forth.\n\nBhagavan added, &quot;It is better just to meditate an=\r\nd have no thought. Let the\nmind rest quietly on the Self in the cave of the=\r\n Spiritual Heart. Soon this\nwill become natural and then there will be no n=\r\need for questions. Do not\nimagine that this means being inactive.Silence is=\r\n the only real activity.&quot;\n\nBhagavan Ramana Maharshi died on April fourteent=\r\nh, 1950. He had said, &quot;I am\ngoing away? Where could I go? I am here.&quot; By th=\r\ne word &quot;here&quot; he did not\nimply any limitation. He meant rather, that the Se=\r\nlf &#39;is&#39;. There is no\ngoing, or coming, or changing in that which is changel=\r\ness and Universal. I\nshould not have regarded his death as a blow. How coul=\r\nd I lose him? How can\none lose anyone? How can one lose that which is Etern=\r\nal? It is only in the\nfirst shock, and gripped in the illusion of death, th=\r\nat one grieves for the\nphysical presence.\n\nYet, millions in India mourned t=\r\nhe Maharshi. A long article about his death\nin the New York Times ended wit=\r\nh, &quot;Here in India, where thousands of\nso-called holy men claim close tune w=\r\nith the infinite, it is said that the\nmost remarkable thing about Ramana Ma=\r\nharshi was that he never claimed\nanything remarkable for himself, yet becam=\r\ne one of the most loved and\nrespected of all.&quot; - [Concluded - Mercedes de A=\r\ncosta died in New York City\nin 1966.]\n\nSource: http://www.arunachala.org/ne=\r\nwsletters/1994/?pg=3Dnov-dec\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=\r\n=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--001636c5bee8f54dbb048a25fe5e\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nQuestion: Is reincarnation a fact?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan: You are inca=\r\nrnated now, aren&#39;t you?
