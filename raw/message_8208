Since she has no experience she will need help so I w=\r\nas wondering can I take a metallic spoon or something to help the fire from=\r\n going out? Any tips how can I help?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Another question that=\r\n arises in my mind is, is it too early for me to teach homam.  Homam requir=\r\nes one to be brahmachari. Due to hormonal issues teens start experiencing s=\r\nexual thoughts and varied emotions. Having a kid control her emotions at su=\r\nch an early age is it really right on my part? Will I be putting pressure o=\r\nn them .....shouldn&#39;t they experience the life in fullest form before endea=\r\nvouring the path of spirituality. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Experienced parents kin=\r\ndly advice me? \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Advance thanks for every help,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Priya\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
