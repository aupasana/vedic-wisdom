I guess most/all the people go through the dilemma that you are facing, s=\r\no there&#39;s nothing new in that.\n\nNow, regarding your objections. Please don&#39;=\r\nt listen to anyone. Most of the objections are either from people who are s=\r\nelfish, ignorant or downright lazy!!! They don&#39;t even make any sense. I am =\r\nnot even going to bother why they are incorrect!!!\n\nNow, to your other obje=\r\nction. See, when you tackle mundane challenges, like say, you want to learn=\r\n a new computer language or a new operating system (like windows), what do =\r\nyou do? Obviously, you start working on it, and over a period of time, with=\r\n dedication and perseverance, you overcome all the obstacles, and become fl=\r\nuent in it. Right? So why not adopt the same attitude in your spiritual pat=\r\nh? Most people whom I know, including myself at one time, had similar reser=\r\nvations, when it came to spirituality! There is nothing that cant be achiev=\r\ned through hard-work, sincerity and dedication. Period!\n\nSecondly, when you=\r\n started out with school by joining Kinder Garten (KG), did you ever pause =\r\nfor a moment and thought ... Wow!! Somewhere down the line, I am going to b=\r\ne solving quadratic equations, probability, differential calculus, which ar=\r\ne so tough that you might run into tons of problems ... so let me not get i=\r\nnto school??? If you think about your questions, they are similar in nature=\r\n to the one above :) !!\n\nDon&#39;t worry about your worthiness, we all are defi=\r\nnitely worthy!! You see, when GOD made us in his own mold, he performed pra=\r\nna pratishthapana on us, i,e, we all have GOD inside us, through which we a=\r\nre divine, and get in touch with him!!! \n\nAll your other questions are just=\r\n unnecessary obstacles you are creating for your self. Stop it and get goin=\r\ng. I remember Shri Manish Pandit telling me, that the best thing about spir=\r\nituality is that if you have sincere intentions, then no matter what, it wi=\r\nll definitely work out. You don&#39;t have to start out as Einstein to succeed!=\r\n\n\nOnce again ... Good Luck!\n\nRegards\nNarayan\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, &quot;waspieswaspies&quot; &lt;waspieswaspies@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste all, \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; I thought that there was no better place to ask this question since this=\r\n is the yahoo group which has inspired me to consider doing the Chandi Homa=\r\nm along with Shri Narasimhaji&#39;s words. My desire to praise the Divine Mothe=\r\nr in this way, keeps increasing everyday especially now that we are coming =\r\nclose to the auspicious Navratri festival. I am plannig to start with the r=\r\necitation first so that I am up to scratch when I start doing the homam. (L=\r\nearning to walk before learning to run) :)\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t know if you had suc=\r\nh dilemmas before you began doing Homams regularly. Please kindly share how=\r\n you have managed? My dilemmas are two-fold. Firstly, I encounter objection=\r\ns from outside from fellow friends and family members who say that &quot;the Cha=\r\nndi homam isn&#39;t part of the family tradition&quot; hence the family devta won&#39;t =\r\nbe pleased or &quot;un-initiated people cannot perform such a high level ritual&quot;=\r\n or even &quot;un-married people cannot get married if they do this on a regular=\r\nly basis&quot;! However, the call to praise the Mother is stronger and I am prep=\r\nared to disregard the superstitions.  \n&gt; \n&gt; What I find harder to discard t=\r\nhough, are personal objections that I create for myself..I call it the &quot;I-a=\r\nm-not-worthy-enough&quot; syndrome. I am not confident of being able to stay com=\r\npletely detached during the homam. I think what I am trying to say is that =\r\nI do not know to what extent my underlying motives can remain pure (unselfi=\r\nsh) enough. At some point or another won&#39;t one end up automatically asking =\r\nfor one&#39;s personal gains? After all, isn&#39;t it human nature to confide every=\r\nthing/ask the Mother for everything..Maa mujhe new car chaahiye, please giv=\r\ne my kids good health/good grades etc? Will one incur the Brahma&#39;s curse fo=\r\nr reciting the Paath with these motives in mind? In that case, is the Brahm=\r\nadi Sapa Vimochan mantra enough to &#39;white-wash&#39; one&#39;s selfish motives?\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Secondly, I have to admit that after listening to some tales about regular=\r\n recitation of the Chandi Paath being associated with &#39;Kundalini jagran&#39;, I=\r\n am a bit worried. Can sadhana and &#39;kundalini jagran&#39; ever be mutually excl=\r\nusive? What if one wants to pray for the sake of praying only? Do they stil=\r\nl have to undergo chakra awakening etc? \n&gt; \n&gt; Thank u.\n&gt; Somanathan\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
