By solid\nreasoning he extracted from the Vedas the truths of Vedanta, and on them\nbuilt up the wonderful system of Jnana that is taught in his commentaries.\nHe unified all the conflicting descriptions of Brahman and showed that there\nis only one Infinite Reality. He showed too that as man can only travel\nslowly on the upward road, all the varied presentations are needed to suit\nhis varying capacity. We find something akin to this in the teachings of\nJesus, which he evidently adapted to the different abilities of his hearers.\nFirst he taught them of a Father in heaven and to pray to Him. Next he rose\na step higher and told them, &quot;I am the vine, you are the branches&quot;, and\nlastly he gave them the highest truth: &quot;I and my Father are one&quot;, and &quot;The\nKingdom of Heaven is within you.&quot; Shankara taught that three things were the\ngreat gifts of God: (1) human body, (2) thirst after God, and (3) a teacher\nwho can show us the light. When these three great gifts are ours, we may\nknow that our redemption is at hand. Only knowledge can free and save us,\nbut with knowledge must go virtue.\n\nDo not pity anyone. Look upon all as your equal, cleanse yourself of the\nprimal sin of inequality. We are all equal and must not think, &quot;I am good\nand you are bad, and I am trying to reclaim you&quot;. Equality is the sign of\nthe free. Jesus came to publicans and sinners and lived with them. He never\nset himself on a pedestal. Only sinners see sin. See not man, see only the\nLord. Spirit is not in time, nor in space. Realise &quot;I am Existence Absolute,\nKnowledge Absolute, Bliss Absolute -- i am He, I am He&quot;. Be glad at birth,\nbe glad at death, rejoice always in the love of God.\n\nThought is all important, for &quot;what we think we become&quot;. There was once a\nSannyasin, a holy man, who sat under a tree and taught the people. He drank\nmilk, and ate only fruit, and made endless &quot;Pranayamas&quot;, and felt himself to\nbe very holy. In the same village lived an evil woman. Every day the\nSannyasin went and warned her that her wickedness would lead her to hell.\nThe poor woman, unable to change her method of life which was her only means\nof livelihood, was still much moved by the terrible future depicted by the\nSannyasin. She wept and prayed to the Lord, begging Him to forgive her\nbecause she could not help herself. By and by both the holy man and the evil\nwoman died. The angels came and bore her to heaven, while the demons claimed\nthe soul of the Sannyasin. &quot;Why is this!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;have I not lived a\nmost holy life, and preached holiness to everybody? Why should I be taken to\nhell while this wicked woman is taken to heaven?&quot; &quot;Because,&quot; answered the\ndemons, &quot;while she was forced to commit unholy acts, her mind was always\nfixed on the Lord and she sought deliverance, which has now come to her. But\nyou, on the contrary, while you performed only holy acts, had your mind\nalways fixed on the wickedness of others. You saw only sin, and thought only\nof sin, so now you have to go to that place where only sin is.&quot; The moral of\nthe story is obvious: The outer life avails little. The heart must be pure\nand the pure heart sees only good, never evil. We should never try to be\nguardians of mankind, or to stand on a pedestal as saints reforming sinners.\nLet us rather purify ourselves, and the result must be that in so doing we\nshall help others.\n\nThe satisfaction of desire only increases it, as oil poured on fire but\nmakes it burn more fiercely. Only through renunciation of this life and of\nall life to come (heaven etc.), can we reach the point where we stand firmly\non the true Self. While we hope for anything, desire still rules us.\n\nBuddha and Christ are the two greatest &quot;bubbles&quot; the world has known. They\nwere great souls who having realised freedom helped others to escape.\nNeither was perfect, but they are to be judged by their virtues, never by\ntheir defects. Jesus fell short, because he did not always live up to his\nown highest ideal; and above all, because he did not give woman an equal\nplace with man. Woman did everything for him, yet not one was made an\napostle. This was doubtless owing to his Semitic origin. The great Aryans,\nBuddha among the rest, have always put woman in an equal position with man.\nFor them sex in religion did not exist. In the Vedas and Upanishads, women\ntaught the highest truths and received the same veneration as men.\n\nBoth happiness and misery are chains, the one golden, the other iron; but\nboth are equally strong to bind us and hold us back from realising our true\nnature. The Atman knows neither happiness nor misery. These are mere\n&quot;states&quot;, and states must ever change. The nature of the soul is bliss and\npeace unchanging. We have not to get it; we have it; let us wash away the\ndross from our eyes and see it. We must stand ever on the Self and look with\nperfect calmness upon all the panorama of the world. It is but baby&#39;s play\nand ought never to disturb us. If the mind is pleased by praise, it will be\npained by blame.\n\nSource:\nhttp://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_8/Lectures_And_Discourses/Discourses_On_Jnana-Yoga\n\n-- \nOm Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya\nPrasanth Jalasutram\n\nLove And Love Alone\n\r\n--00163600d59b87ccf50472bb37ee\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-fami=\r\nly: Verdana; &quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;post-body entry-content&quot; style=3D&quot;margin-top: =\r\n0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px; line-heigh=\r\nt: 1.3em; &quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold; &quot;&gt;Volume 8, Lectures And Dis=\r\ncourses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This world is a relative world, a shadow of the real;=\r\n still, being the plane of equipoise where happiness and misery are about e=\r\nvenly balanced, it is the only plane where man can realise his true Self an=\r\nd know that he is Brahman.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold; &quot;&gt;The =\r\ngreatest teacher of the Vedanta philosophy was Shankaracharya.&lt;/span&gt;=A0By =\r\nsolid reasoning he extracted from the Vedas the truths of Vedanta, and on t=\r\nhem built up the wonderful system of Jnana that is taught in his commentari=\r\nes.
