On the other side the Vegetarians can get that from Yoghur=\r\nt, Cheese and such foods. And such many points can be discussed from both t=\r\nhe sides.\n\n2) Few of the Arguments of Vegetarians and vegans is that of &quot;Fo=\r\nrmation of Teeth&quot;, &quot;Formation of Intestines&quot; etc=85 They say that Human tee=\r\nth formation and digestive systems are not suitable for diet from the sourc=\r\ne of Animals.  They site the examples of a Hoarse, cow, Elephant, Goat, buf=\r\nfalo and compare that with Humans. Which I found not proved when I see peop=\r\nle around me.  Majority of the population today and earlier are meat eaters=\r\n and there does not seem any noticeable physical difference which suggest a=\r\nny difficulties for them. It is also noticed that because of High protein c=\r\nontents, they are well built. Same way Physical strength, stamina, recovery=\r\n from Illness and such were never issues with generations of people in Indi=\r\na and else where who never used meat and sea food in their diet.\n\nSo scienc=\r\ne will not be able to give definitive answer for some one to decide between=\r\n 2 strict options, unless science proves without a doubt, that a certain di=\r\nsease or a Physical ailment or a mental abnormality is only because of *eat=\r\ning meat* or *NOT eating meat* and that should also clearly visible in prac=\r\ntical cases which affect large section of masses. Till that time, so called=\r\n science, will mainly be used as a tool to debate on this issue of vegetari=\r\nanism and Non-vegetarianism because we do see that Diabetic ailment, Cardia=\r\nc patients, Blood pressure problems and such many commonly seen diseases ar=\r\ne found in all sections of society irrespective of meat eaters or vegetaria=\r\nns. Both sections are living their lives for Generations and generations.\n\n=\r\n\nRegarding Holistic approach, ethics, Low of Karma etc=85\n\n1)\tOne of My ver=\r\ny close doctor friend who is a pediatric surgeon (M.Ch. in Pediatrics) and =\r\na strict vegetarian who also obviously contains a vast knowledge of medical=\r\n science gave me a certain interesting fact. During his studies, their batc=\r\nh was once taken to a place called Deonar in Mumbai, (where there is one of=\r\n the biggest Slaughter houses of India. Daily around 4000 various animals a=\r\nre slaughtered to meet the need of Maharashtra and to some extent India and=\r\n 60% is exported mainly to Arab countries). 4 or 5 females from their batch=\r\n could not stand the process of slaughtering and they fell unconscious. Alm=\r\nost everybody including himself was shocked and disgusted to see the slaugh=\r\nterhouse and left the place with heavy hearts.\n\n2)\tThere are meat eaters wh=\r\no are well advanced in spiritual path and there are vegetarians who are utt=\r\nerly selfish and deep down in materialism hence I refrain to talk on that l=\r\nine. Only I wish to say one thing that ethics, spirituality and such terms =\r\nshould not be used selectively as per our own conveniences. Something which=\r\n is unethical will remain unethical. To me, Killing animals, while better a=\r\nlternate sources are available, to satiate hunger and far worst, to tickle =\r\nthe palate, is Unethical and simply unethical, be it or Earth or on Mars, b=\r\ne it Kaliyuga or Satyuga.\n\n\n3)\tSolution is not to look if a Famous Saint or=\r\n Philosopher or any body, famous or otherwise, approves meat eating or disp=\r\nroves it or suggests middle approach, it does not make any difference. If V=\r\nimalananda emphatically suggest not to eat meat or otherwise (Vimalananda w=\r\nas very clear for meat eating though), does not make any difference. Law of=\r\n Karma might be infinitely complex and might need deepest of understanding =\r\nbut that does not suggest any thing. Who knows if next birth is there or no=\r\nt? However what really suggestive and decisively suggestive should be our o=\r\nwn Instincts, our own thinking, our own rationale, our own heart. Why depen=\r\nd upon any body coming and telling us about if we should eat meat or should=\r\n not.  Why not follow our own conscious and rationale. I do not know if I k=\r\nill a Goat and eat meat of the same, in the next life or lives, I will be k=\r\nilled by the same Goat and I have to go through the same pain. Hardly anybo=\r\ndy knows that but when it comes to the present, I know for sure that the me=\r\nat I am eating has been of an animal that has been butchered mercilessly. T=\r\nhat much is known without a doubt and that should make me think. If *avoida=\r\nble*, I must not eat that. It is that simple. Do not need further approval =\r\nof anybody and no amount of arguments from Science or culture or religions =\r\nor whatever should stand for me. Do I need to even look at those? NO.\n\nBest=\r\n Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;ved=\r\nic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Atul Ji and List members,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;I am not =\r\nadvocating Non-veg food. I am\n&gt; &gt;just highlighting the facts. I am a strict=\r\n vegetarian too. We &gt;should understand that we may be right but we should r=\r\nealize that &gt;it does not &gt;necessarily mean other person is not right.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nMy views are there on this subject in archives. I wanted to stay away but s=\r\ntill inspired to write at least one message on the same.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Using Argu=\r\nments based on science, BV, so many of researches and plenty of information=\r\ns available on the Internet, One will never be able to come to a definitive=\r\n conclusions.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) I never argue with people (even when I was aggressive=\r\n and passionate about the Idea of vegetarian food) with the above basis.\n&gt; =\r\nWhatever said and done, people will continue eating meat, eggs, Fish, Other=\r\n seafood and probably Human flash as well. I have, with experience, underst=\r\nood that there is no point in arguing with people giving various Data. Each=\r\n side will have their own arguments, own sets of Data and own Counter Ideas=\r\n to prove their point.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) Instead I appeal their conscious! I tell peo=\r\nple around me, whenever the Topic comes up, only one simple thing - &quot;I dont=\r\n want to kill for filling up my Stomach&quot; and I say it from my heart. I tell=\r\n people that Put a knife edge on your own Throat or Cut a finger only a lit=\r\ntle, feel the pain and now realize the Plight of a butchered Chicken or a G=\r\noat or a cow or a buffalo or a...., Suffocate yourself by closing Nose & Mo=\r\nuth and see after only a few seconds, how you pent for the Air and Now real=\r\nize the &quot;Chhatpataahat&quot; of a fish forced out of water.\n&gt; \n&gt; And all these, =\r\nbecause one wish to fill the stomach or satisfy cravings of a habitual pala=\r\nte or both. Even vegetarians have their cravings of spice and other food st=\r\nuff but the very vital difference is that such craving does not need killin=\r\ng!\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) Just to give a result, One of colleagues, who is a Srilankan, ha=\r\ns left eating meat since 6 Months now and surely, one of the reasons for hi=\r\ns leaving meat is because I told my views him a few times when such discuss=\r\nions came up and I even told him that you are a Buddhist, the religion of N=\r\non-Injury and see what has happened to that very Idea. Hats-off to him for =\r\nhe really seems to have thought about it and dared to change his swabhava w=\r\nhich is so very difficult.\n&gt; Just to clarify, I do not hesitate to express =\r\nmy views even to Muslims and others and at least, this idea is appreciated =\r\nby them even if grudgingly. The Hard core meat eaters are also taken a back=\r\n with this idea. All though they know from their hearts of hearts, it comes=\r\n as a shock even to them when somebody boldly brings that up. Most of us ar=\r\ne like a cat that drinks the milk with closed eyes. The Idea would have gon=\r\ne in their mind and that is enough. One day probably it will germinate.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; 5) Finally, The point is not to say that this side is good and that side =\r\nis bad. It&#39;ll be a foolish and unpalatable conclusion. It is to just appeal=\r\n the inside human of each individual, It is to appeal the rational Intellig=\r\nence of an Individual, It is to appeal the heart of a person and if that is=\r\n not suffice to our ultra-hardened heart then a final reminder of &quot;Law of C=\r\nause and effect -The Law of Karma&quot; at least to those of us who believe in N=\r\natures unfailing governance. And that is the final Idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Dr. A.

Please point out my mistakes I will make=\r\n in this process.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We are trying to discuss three points here\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; 1) Choosing a dietary habit\n&gt; &gt; 2) Dependence of Human population on No=\r\nn-veg sources of nutrition\n&gt; &gt; 3) bioavailability or BV of Non veg vs Veg f=\r\nood.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I commented on two points \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) Choosing a dietary hab=\r\nit \n&gt; &gt; 2) Dependence of Human population on non veg sources of nutrition\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) Choosing a Dietary habit\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One should choose his dietary =\r\nhabit based on his varna (aptitude and attitude) and goal in his life. He s=\r\nhould not bother what the BV or other factor or research says. For an athle=\r\nte, Eggs are important part of his training. and for a person seeking spiri=\r\ntuality one should stick to vegetarian food unless he is able to rise above=\r\n the difference in veg and nonveg. I agree with Narasimha Ji about this poi=\r\nnt.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In some diseases Non veg sources play an very important role (=\r\nAlthough not a necessasity) like in Albumin deficiency two eggs per day can=\r\n save a person from costly (3000Rs per Inj) Albumin Injections. In TB, Soup=\r\n made of goat meat do wonders. Ayurveda also recommend it strongly Charak S=\r\namhita) etc.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) Dependence of Human population on non veg sources =\r\nof nutrition\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I agree with the link provided in this discussions. B=\r\nooks and articles by Peta members are far more convincing for switching to =\r\nVeg sources. I can also provide tens of links and book reference which oppo=\r\nse their view. Honestly, I do not believe each and every information on net=\r\n and not every book written about nutirtion, just like astrology. Let us le=\r\nave this debate aside and look at other aspect of it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; By &#39;Practica=\r\nlly impossible&#39; I meant the cost factor and demand/supply factor. In India =\r\n(Leave other high Nonveg consuming countries alone) about 45% people are No=\r\nn vegetarian and about 40% demand of Proteins are supplied by Non veg sourc=\r\nes. Currently, Important veg sourcesof proteins are Legumes (including gram=\r\n soyabean, pulses etc. Costs about Rs 80 -120 Rs per Kg), Nuts (include alm=\r\nonds cashew etc - Costs needn&#39;t mention), Dairy products (Milk being 30-40 =\r\nRs per Kg), Grains (cheapest sources but not a very complete source), \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; In last two years, their demand rose by 15-20 % but their price rose b=\r\ny 40-60%. even at current price, 60 % of population can not afford a comple=\r\nte balanced diet as recommended by Experts which include 250 Ml of milk, 50=\r\n-70 gms of legumes, 10 gms of vegetables, 150 gms of fruits per person, alo=\r\nng with grains and roughage etc (These are approx minimum quantities. Diffe=\r\nrent sources may quote different quantities). There is average family size =\r\nof 5 and average family income is 200 Rs per day! And nutrition is not the =\r\nonly thing needed in our life!!! Lot of other expenditures are there\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Even at current prices, 60% population can not afford balanced diet. If =\r\nadditional 40% is included in demand of veg sources, price may rise another=\r\n 100% and I need not to explain what will happen at that time.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sir=\r\n, I am not advocating Non-veg food here. I am also a strict vegetarian, eve=\r\nn for milk I prefer a source where there is minimum cruelity (Yes you can n=\r\not expect no cruelity even for milk if you buy it from market and do not pr=\r\noduce it yourself)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Again, I think and believe that practically it =\r\nis impossible to shift all the population to veg sources especially when th=\r\ne agriculture land is decreasing day by day because of many reasons)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; 3) Bioavailability or BV of different sources\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is always a qu=\r\nestionable point. because again sections supporting vegetarian diet will hi=\r\nghlight the results which support veg food and vice versa. There are lot of=\r\n  halfbaked researches. but if we think scientifically we will find that fo=\r\nr different sources different sources are better. For example calcium anima=\r\nl sources are best (Including milk), for albumin Egg is best, for Vit C veg=\r\n sources are best, for proteins animal sources are best (Ayurveda also supp=\r\nort this) So I think we can not say that only veg or non veg will suffice t=\r\nhe diet. Obviously humans can not survive on Nonveg food alone. As far as B=\r\nV is concerned I agree with the values given by Rajarshi ji.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes, =\r\nI agree Non veg food increases tamas in mind. But so does the deep fried ve=\r\ngetarian food, although less but in daily habit it will not let you escape =\r\nfrom Tamas. I agree with Narasimha Ji that if more energy is used in digest=\r\ning food, less energy is available for brain. it is a scietific fact that a=\r\nfter food, significant blood supply is directed to intestines. How much Raj=\r\nas Spicy food, tea, coffee, coke and Red bull is increasing in us? We are w=\r\nhat we eat! This is true. So one should eat what one want to become.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; But still at last, I want to mention that I am not advocating Non-veg fo=\r\nod. I am just highlighting the facts. I am a strict vegetarian too. We shou=\r\nld understand that we may be right but we should realise that it does not n=\r\necessarily mean other person is not right.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Please point out my mis=\r\ntakes I had made in this post. I agree that some values i mentioned here ma=\r\ny not be exactly as quoted by sources. But they are approximate and not too=\r\n much off the line.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kind Regards\n&gt; &gt; Atul\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I disgree with two poi=\r\nnts you mentioned. Let me clarify. (I am only dealing with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the scien=\r\nce part of these discussions, as I had already maintained right at the \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; beginning).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (3) I heard an interview with a scientist=\r\n on NPR (National Public Radio) several \n&gt; &gt; &gt; months back. They conducted =\r\nan experiment on gorillas. One set of gorillas was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fed with meat. Th=\r\ne other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After several \n&gt; &gt; &gt; months, res=\r\nearchers found a gap in the intelligence of the two sets. The ones \n&gt; &gt; &gt; f=\r\ned with meat were duller.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If=C2=A0you have any references for =\r\nthis, in terms of whether they published any \n&gt; &gt; &gt; paper on the same, I am=\r\n interested to know and analyse that in details. I am \n&gt; &gt; &gt; open to learni=\r\nng and reviewing my position, provided there is genuine evidence.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Their theory was that digestion of meat takes up more energy. Gor=\r\nillas fed with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; nuts and fruits may have diverted more energy towards=\r\n the development of brain. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though they were not sure if the same thi=\r\nng applies to human beings or not,=C2=A0=C2=A0a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; balanced vegetarian =\r\ndiet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellectual development.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; This is a wrong theory as far as human nutrition=C2=A0is concerned, becau=\r\nse human \n&gt; &gt; &gt; stomach structure (gut morphology) is such that it finds ce=\r\nrtain animal products \n&gt; &gt; &gt; far easier to digest than most planet based pr=\r\noducts. In my other mail, I have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; qoted from a couple of research pap=\r\ners and books on clinical nutrition and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; dietetics, and if you ask, I=\r\n can provide more; which may=C2=A0take a few days since I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have to ge=\r\nt them from people who deal with these topics professionally, but time \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; is not a problem.=C2=A0All the papers are=C2=A0from the most accepted an=\r\nd reputed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; scientific=C2=A0journals. There is no confusion. Which is =\r\nwhy I said, it is myth \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that=C2=A0vegeterian=C2=A0foods are=C2=A0easi=\r\ner to digest, if digestibility is the criteria. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nFurther, in my experience, I never found traditional vegeterians to be any =\r\nmore \n&gt; &gt; &gt; dull or smarter than traditional omnivores. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Animals have their own vaasanas a=\r\nnd their needs. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. O=\r\ntherwise, feed the poor \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fellow whatever he/she needs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; An animal has a specific physical=C2=A0structure and needs to maintain=\r\n the same. But \n&gt; &gt; &gt; if trained they can &#39;adjust&#39; to any kind of meals. I =\r\nhave seen people feeding \n&gt; &gt; &gt; vegeterian diets to dogs. Statistically spe=\r\naking, an animal whose whole body \n&gt; &gt; &gt; structure is designed to be a carn=\r\nivore, may adjust to any food for the sake of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; survival, but will bec=\r\nome internally weak and susceptable to disease and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; weaknesses. Who t=\r\nakes the karma for the disease and weakness that may result \n&gt; &gt; &gt; from an =\r\nunnatural diet to an animal? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Not that all dogs w=\r\nho are feed a veg diet end up being diseased, but the chances \n&gt; &gt; &gt; increa=\r\nse a lot. It is like not all smokers die of cancer, but smoking makes one \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; susceptible to cancer. It increases the probability. Therefore my per=\r\nsonal \n&gt; &gt; &gt; opinion is that an animal if kept at home, it should taken car=\r\ne of in the best \n&gt; &gt; &gt; way possible, providing it with whatever maybe need=\r\ned, including the right diet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; _____________=\r\n__\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A question for you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; S=\r\ncientists studying evolution and human body structures have concluded that =\r\nmeat \n&gt; &gt; &gt; eating along with cropping and fruits has been prevelant since =\r\nat least 4 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; million years.

A few quick comments.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (1) We are we w=\r\ne eat. Production of various chemicals in our body and their \n&gt; &gt; &gt; interac=\r\ntions, are controlled by what we eat. Thus, what we eat has a profound \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; impact on us.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (2) Much has been written on the material ben=\r\nefits from vegetarianism. But that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is not all. There are spiritual a=\r\nnd subtle reasons as well.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Eating the flesh or body parts of a=\r\nn animal that strongly identifies with the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; physical body entails a k=\r\narma. Self-identification of plants with their physical \n&gt; &gt; &gt; body is much=\r\n subtler and the karma entailed in eating plant-based foods is much \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nsmaller.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Especially these days, very cruel methods are used fo=\r\nr meat production by \n&gt; &gt; &gt; corporations and animals are treated very cruel=\r\nly. Part of the karma for their \n&gt; &gt; &gt; suffering goes to the ones benefitin=\r\ng from their meat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (3) I heard an interview with a scientist o=\r\nn NPR (National Public Radio) several \n&gt; &gt; &gt; months back. They conducted an=\r\n experiment on gorillas. One set of gorillas was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fed with meat. The =\r\nother set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After several \n&gt; &gt; &gt; months, resea=\r\nrchers found a gap in the intelligence of the two sets. The ones \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fed=\r\n with meat were duller.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Their theory was that digestion of mea=\r\nt takes up more energy. Gorillas fed with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; nuts and fruits may have d=\r\niverted more energy towards the development of brain. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though they we=\r\nre not sure if the same thing applies to human beings or not, a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bala=\r\nnced vegetarian diet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellectual development.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (4) After we eat a heavy meal, we may feel dull or sleepy and c=\r\nannot focus well \n&gt; &gt; &gt; on work that requires alertness and skill. That is =\r\nbecause the digestive process \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is using up a lot of energy (also know=\r\nn as agni or fire) and there isn&#39;t much \n&gt; &gt; &gt; agni available for other act=\r\nivities such as digestion of intellectual ideas that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; happens in the =\r\nmind. Similarly, digestion of spiritual ideas/experiences also \n&gt; &gt; &gt; requi=\r\nres agni and that cannot happen well. That is why meditation or homam after=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a heavy meal are fruitless and we are normally advised to do sadhan=\r\na before \n&gt; &gt; &gt; eating.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (5) If foods that light up a higher di=\r\ngestive agni (e.g. meats, deep fried food \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with more oil, spicy foods=\r\n that stimulate digestive agni etc) are consumed more \n&gt; &gt; &gt; frequently, ag=\r\nni is diverted towards digestion more often and there is less agni \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a=\r\nvailable for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and experiences.=\r\n If \n&gt; &gt; &gt; one eats saattwik food that is very easy to digest (simple grain=\r\ns, simple \n&gt; &gt; &gt; lentils and simple vegetables, all softly cooked with mild=\r\n spices, and fruits), \n&gt; &gt; &gt; less agni is diverted towards digestion and mo=\r\nre agni is available for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ide=\r\nas and experiences.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (6) Even a big fire cannot burn wet grass =\r\nwell. But huge stacks of dry grass may \n&gt; &gt; &gt; be burnt by just one spark! S=\r\nimilarly, little bit of internal fire may be enough \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to assimilate sp=\r\niritual ideas and experiences in a person with excellent \n&gt; &gt; &gt; vaasanas an=\r\nd few obstructions (dry grass). A lot of internal fire may be needed \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n in a person with poor vaasanas and many obstructions (wet grass). Thus, it=\r\n all \n&gt; &gt; &gt; depends on vaasanas and impurities in nadis and chakras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One person may eat meat and deep fried foods, spend a lot of agni on=\r\n digesting \n&gt; &gt; &gt; them and yet make excellent spiritual progress. Another p=\r\nerson may eat saattwik \n&gt; &gt; &gt; food, maximize the agni available for spiritu=\r\nal transformation and yet struggle \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to progress spiritually. However,=\r\n the best course of action for one is to ignore \n&gt; &gt; &gt; counter-examples and=\r\n be a vegetarian. All other things being equal, that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; maximizes the a=\r\ngni available for spiritual progress.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s qu=\r\nestion: Animals have their own vaasanas and their needs. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If an anima=\r\nl can survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fel=\r\nlow whatever he/she needs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (8) One should eat to live and not =\r\nlive to eat. A yogi should consume enough \n&gt; &gt; &gt; food to sustain oneself so=\r\n that one can fulfil one&#39;s dharma in the material \n&gt; &gt; &gt; world using physic=\r\nal body and make spiritual progress. Eating too much food is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; not goo=\r\nd for spiritual sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Instead of overeating most of the tim=\r\ne and fasting on specific days, it is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; better to eat limited amount a=\r\nlways. Regular practices are more important for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; transformation and s=\r\nuccess, than occasional practices.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (9) By merely thinking that=\r\n god is the doer of all actions or considering food \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to be god&#39;s pras=\r\nad, one cannot escape the karma involved. It depends on how \n&gt; &gt; &gt; deeply i=\r\nngrained that thought is and how deeply one feels so. If one internally \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; feels 100% that god is acting through one and whatever one is doing (e.=\r\ng. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; eating) is just god&#39;s prasad to one, then one is free.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, J=\r\nyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and =\r\nPitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a=\r\n difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.y=\r\nahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------=\r\n------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
