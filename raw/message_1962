Energy here can be loosely t=\r\nranslated as ability to get something. You get the ability to get something=\r\n as a reaction to your action of conserving mental energy that could&#39;ve bee=\r\nn spent on wandering here and there.\n \nAs you do the sadhana (homam or japa=\r\nm or whatever) by controlling the mind for a long time, you start to accumu=\r\nlate more and more energy. Some of it may be used up to pay back some energ=\r\ny you owe, on account of your karmik debts. This may help avoid some negati=\r\nve results in reaction to previous actions. We also term this as burning of=\r\nf of bad karmas.\n \nSome of it may be used up to fulfil your wishes. Suppose=\r\n you strongly thought in the past &quot;I wish I had xyz&quot;. Nature may give you x=\r\nyz, if you have enough energy to get xyz by using up some of it. Nature act=\r\ns as an intelligent bank that keeps track of your balance and automatically=\r\n pays off some debts and automatically buys with credit some things you wan=\r\nted to buy.\n \nEvery action and reaction in the field of duality is essentia=\r\nlly a play of various energies.\n \n*        *        *\n \nSuppose one is doin=\r\ng intense sadhana with a good level of control over the mind. Suppose one i=\r\ns not excited by seemingly good happenings and suppose one is not angered o=\r\nr saddened by seemingly bad happenings. Suppose one maintains an equanimous=\r\n and stable mind. Then one keeps generating energy while consuming very lit=\r\ntle of it for mental activity. Of course, if there is ANY mental activity (=\r\ne.g. anger at someone, desire of something, disappointment with something, =\r\nexcitement at something etc), the activity of the mind uses up some energy.=\r\n\n \nIf a yogi maintains a peaceful, relaxed, calm and equanimous state of mi=\r\nnd over a long time, one can generate a tremendous amount of shakti. Rishis=\r\n used to have enough shakti, generated from great tapascharya and maintenan=\r\nce of mental equanimity for decades or centuries and millennia in some case=\r\ns, that they could cause big changes in the entire universe.\n \n*        *  =\r\n      *\n \nEverything boils down to control and mind and mental activity. Al=\r\nl sadhanas we do are for enhancing control over mind. It does not come in o=\r\nne day.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrol=\r\noger.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/t=\r\narpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotis=\r\nh lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (=\r\nWindows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website=\r\n: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n---------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------- \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Murahari Va=\r\ndapalli \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Sunday, June 07, 2009 =\r\n9:13 PM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Saying mantras audibly (Re: Help me R=\r\negarding...)\n\n        Namaste Narasimha, \n\n        &gt;&gt;If one has some shakti=\r\n accumulated with a specific mantra, one&#39;s chanting of that mantra is infus=\r\ned with that shakti.\n\n        Thanks for sharing your thoughts on chanting =\r\nmantras and distribution of accumulated energies through mantras. \n\n       =\r\n &gt;&gt; But, when one does sadhana with the mantra, one&#39;s chanting of the mantr=\r\na is infused with some power.  \n\n        Can you please elaborate more on &quot;=\r\nhow and why sadhana leads to accumulation of energies&quot;? \n\n        Thanks & =\r\nRegards,\n        --Murahari\n\n\n\n        --- On Mon, 6/8/09, Narasimha P.V.R.=\r\n Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n          From: Narasimha P.V.R.

The lowest level is vaikhari. This is the sou=\r\nnd at the physical level. When you say something by moving the physical bod=\r\ny parts (lips etc), their movement vibrates the air particles and those vib=\r\nrations vibrate the physical body parts in the ears of listeners and people=\r\n around you can &quot;listen&quot;.\n\n          At the same time, the subtle thoughts =\r\nin the mind accompanying the chanting of the mantra result in movement in p=\r\narts of your &quot;subtle body&quot;, which vibrate the subtle space around you and t=\r\nhose cause some vibrations in the subtle bodies of people around you.\n\n    =\r\n      In this way, sound (or vibration) is produced at 4 levels. The subtle=\r\nr the level, the longer the signal can carry without decaying.\n\n          *=\r\n        *        *\n\n          If one has some shakti accumulated with a spe=\r\ncific mantra, one&#39;s chanting of that mantra is infused with that shakti.\n\n =\r\n         The energy infused when one chants a mantra is carried mainly in t=\r\nhe subtler levels of sound. The energy carried at the physical level (vaikh=\r\nari) of sound is very small compared to the energy carried in the subtler l=\r\nevels. However, the vaikhari level sound contains the key to the subtler le=\r\nvels for most people.\n\n          I can explain this using an analogy. One m=\r\nay have a powerful concept or idea in mind that one is thinking of. Most ot=\r\nher people cannot read one&#39;s mind and cannot access that concept or idea. H=\r\nowever, if one expresses the idea in words, people will be able to access t=\r\nhat idea. Most of the power is in the idea and not in the exact words used.=\r\n However, the written/spoken words that are tangible to others act as a key=\r\n to one&#39;s thoughts. World can now access the power of one&#39;s idea!\n\n        =\r\n  Similarly, the exact letters or words of a mantra are not really alive wi=\r\nth energy. But, when one does sadhana with the mantra, one&#39;s chanting of th=\r\ne mantra is infused with some power. Other people cannot access that power =\r\nnormally. But, once one says the mantra in an audible form (just like expre=\r\nssing the idea in tangible words above), the power in one&#39;s chanting of the=\r\n mantra is accessible to those who hear it. Even though the power is not re=\r\nally in the audible sound produced, the audible sound acts as a key to the =\r\ninaudible sound and world can now access the power of one&#39;s chanting (just =\r\nas the written words act as a key to one&#39;s idea and the world can now acces=\r\ns the power of one&#39;s idea).\n\n          When you chant a mantra silently, yo=\r\nu are hiding your shakti with the mantra from the world. When you chant a m=\r\nantra loud, you are sharing your shakti with the mantra with the world. Som=\r\ne of it can be wasted and some of it can be tapped by someone.\n\n          *=\r\n        *        *\n\n          If leaves, flowers and fruits are plucked fro=\r\nm a small plant, it will not grow and it will die. Similarly, one&#39;s shakti =\r\nwith a mantra will not grow if one keeps saying that mantra loud now and th=\r\nen. As one keeps chanting a mantra silently, while maintaining some yama an=\r\nd niyama, one will slowly accumulate shakti with it.\n\n          If you do n=\r\not intend to accumulate shakti with any mantra, that is fine too. That is N=\r\nOT an impediment to self-purification and self-realization. However, certai=\r\nn tasks in this dual world require an accumulation of enough shakti with a =\r\nmantra. If one&#39;s guru wants one to do something in future and asks one to a=\r\nccumulate shakti with a specific mantra, one has to do it.\n\n          *    =\r\n    *        *\n\n          Manish&#39;s guru was a realized man. His name was Na=\r\nkhate Maharaj. He was a Bhadra Kaali worshipper. He was blessed by a darsha=\r\nn of Bhadra Kaali and went into nirvikalpa samadhi at the age of 21 years. =\r\nHe remained in nirvikalpa samadhi for 7 days and returned to the dual world=\r\n to perform the tasks assigned to him, as a detached actor.\n\n          Even=\r\n a realized man like him did not utter some mantras audibly. For example, w=\r\nhen he gave a specific mantra to Manish, the means he employed were quite o=\r\nld-fashioned. He did not say the mantra in Manish&#39;s ear. Instead, he asked =\r\nManish to sit down with closed eyes and placed his thumbs on Manish&#39;s templ=\r\nes. He asked Manish to focus and then he also focused. Manish saw a mantra =\r\nin Devanagari script in letters made of fire. He remembered what he saw and=\r\n did sadhana with that mantra.\n\n          *        *        *\n\n          Th=\r\nese methods are used for a purpose and not out of selfishness. There are tw=\r\no main reasons:\n\n          (1) You want to keep the shakti you accumulated =\r\nwith that mantra, because there is a purpose for it. Giving is great, but g=\r\niving indiscriminately is unwise. When one can do finite tasks, one has to =\r\noptimize what one does.\n          (2) Nothing that comes too easy lasts. If=\r\n one gets a million bucks easily, one can waste it. Instead of giving milli=\r\non dollars to someone, it will be better if you teach one how to work hard =\r\nand make money.\n\n          Sharing various thoughts and spiritual truths an=\r\nd inspiring people to do sadhana is one thing and sharing one&#39;s accumulated=\r\n shakti with a mantra with people another.\n\n          *        *        *\n\n=\r\n          As I mentioned Nakhate Maharaj, I want to mention a small story a=\r\nbout him.\n\n          When Nakhate Maharaj left this world, his sishyas had =\r\nan interesting experience. Manish was in UK meditating at that time. He sud=\r\ndenly felt that his guru was in front of him. He opened his eyes and saw th=\r\nat Nakhate Maharaj was standing in front of him physically. He held his pal=\r\nm up in the blessing pose. Then he waved his hand as if saying good bye. Th=\r\nen he disappeared. When Manish called India later, he found out that Nakhat=\r\ne Maharaj left his body at the same time in India. He also found out that h=\r\nis other sishyas too had the same experience in different parts of the worl=\r\nd around the same time.\n\n          Best regards,\n          Narasimha\n      =\r\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\n    =\r\n      Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n     =\r\n     Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n   =\r\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n          F=\r\nree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n          Fre=\r\ne Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n          Sri =\r\nJagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n          -----=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------- \n\n           =\r\n ----- Original Message ----- \n            From: Jyotisa Shisya \n          =\r\n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n            Sent: Sunday, June 07, 2009=\r\n 10:45 AM\n            Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Help me Regarding SAV=\r\nITRU GAAYATHRI MANTHRAM\n\n            |om|\n            Dear Narasimha, namas=\r\nte & pranaams\n             \n            Please forgive me if I am seen to b=\r\ne impertinent in my question based on the lines in bold below.\n            =\r\n \n            Why must the Guru upadesa be kept secret and not shared with =\r\nanyone who might benefit?

I can record other mantras in my vo=\r\nice and share with all, but instructed to not give Savitur Gayatri mantra i=\r\nn my voice to anyone. It is my spiritual food. Most of my spiritual experie=\r\nnces came with this mantra and I need this mantra for more things in future=\r\n. So I keep it to myself and do not share it with all.\n\n            But man=\r\ny people in your city should be able to teach you this mantra with correct =\r\npronunciation. By the way, I think you live in Chennai. If so, please try t=\r\no meet Swami Sathasivom at Kalikambal temple on Thambuchetty Street near Ce=\r\nntral station.

Surrender to your chosen deity, =\r\nsee that deity in all people and serve people around you. See god in all pe=\r\nople.

Most of the power is in the idea and \n          not =\r\nin the exact words used. However, the written/spoken words that \n          =\r\nare tangible to others act as a key to one&#39;s thoughts.

But, when one does sadhana \n          with the ma=\r\nntra, one&#39;s chanting of the mantra is infused with some \n          power. O=\r\nther people cannot access that power normally. But, once one \n          say=\r\ns the mantra in an audible form (just like expressing the idea in \n        =\r\n  tangible words above), the power in one&#39;s chanting of the mantra is \n    =\r\n      accessible to those who hear it. Even though the power is not really =\r\n\n          in the audible sound produced, the audible sound acts as a key t=\r\no the \n          inaudible sound and world can now access the power of one&#39;=\r\ns chanting \n          (just as the written words act as a key to one&#39;s idea=\r\n and the world \n          can now access the power of one&#39;s idea).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n          &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n       =\r\n   &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;When you chant a mantra silently, you a=\r\nre \n          hiding your shakti with the mantra from the world.

By the \n            way, I think you live in Chennai. =\r\nIf so, please try to meet Swami \n            Sathasivom at Kalikambal templ=\r\ne on Thambuchetty Street near Central \n            station. He belongs to a=\r\n rare class of priests who are fast becoming \n            extinct in this c=\r\nommercial age. If possible, meet him and take his \n            blessings.&lt;/=\r\nFONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;My intuition tells me that y=\r\nou are a \n            man made for karma yoga rather than meditation and ve=\r\nda mantras. \n            Surrender to your chosen deity, see that deity in =\r\nall people and \n            serve people around you. See god in all people.=\r\n If possible, think \n            of starting a small movement in the slums =\r\nof Chennai (or wherever \n            you live). Go, serve people there, hel=\r\np them to the best of your \n            ability and teach them about god. A=\r\nfter helping them materially \n            first, then teach them to chant g=\r\nod&#39;s name when they have a few \n            minutes of time. In my opinion,=\r\n this is the right path for \n            you.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT fac=\r\ne=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Actions performed with ego, pride and \n            attac=\r\nhment bind one.

Do not be upset with a few failures \n       =\r\n     in the beginning (upset comes with attachment.
