But, if there is a feeling of guilt or regret in the mind (&quot;today is so and so day. I wish I could also pray to so and so deity&quot;), then one is perhaps not ready for commitment to one deity and an attraction to various forms is still there in the mind.\n \nThen it is perhaps a good idea to worship other deities also. One can worship the other deity in addition to regular deity (ishta devata), in idol or fire.\n \nSlowly, one can cultivate the thinking that all other deities are manifestations of one&#39;s ishta devata and imagine one&#39;s ishta devata even when worshipping any other deity using any other mantra. Over the time, this firmly embeds in one&#39;s mind the understanding that all is One and one&#39;s ishta devata becomes the avenue to realizing that One. Then, one does not feel any guilt when one worships ishta devata on all days and leaves other forms.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- Priya M &lt;prm7782@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; PVR garu, although I got the point of praying one god only but still a little\n&gt; confused.

Our purpose is to show people a\n&gt; way to reaching god through worshipping different forms in fire.\n&gt;\n&gt; There are some more forms that still need to be added, like Subrahmanya, Lalita,\n&gt; Rama, Narasimha, Grahas, Ayyappa, Saraswati, Hayagriva, Purusha etc. God\n&gt; willing, more manuals will become available later. At this time, several people\n&gt; have found some deity they like and are doing homam as a sadhana. This first\n&gt; batch of people will make some progress and inspire another batch of people in\n&gt; the coming years. We will probably need more options then.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, different forms exist because people with different gunas like forms with\n&gt; different gunas. But, getting close to one form requires focus on it. For one&#39;s\n&gt; thoughts to be focused on a form most of the times, for one&#39;s mind to be\n&gt; reverberating with a mantra most of the times and for one&#39;s mind to be filled\n&gt; with a form most of the times, one needs to do sadhana with one form. If one\n&gt; keeps switching from one form to another form, all those forms remain in the\n&gt; periphery of one&#39;s mind and none of them takes over the mind.\n&gt;\n&gt; There are many valid paths to climbing a mountain. But, one who keeps going\n&gt; around the mountain enjoying the views offered by different paths to the top,\n&gt; may never reach top. One who instead picks one path and keeps walking may reach\n&gt; the top. Once one reaches the top, one can, of course, see all paths from there\n&gt; and appreciate all paths. An Adi Shankara, as you said, may extoll various\n&gt; deities after reaching god with one form.\n&gt;\n&gt; As Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said in this matter, you need to dig in one place if\n&gt; you want to find water. Digging one meter here, one meter there and one meter\n&gt; elsewhere, is unproductive.\n&gt;\n&gt; If there is a strong desire to worship many forms and if sticking to one form\n&gt; seems binding, perhaps one is not ready for sticking to one form.\n&gt;\n&gt; After all, some people are not born to find water or reach the top of the\n&gt; mountain. They are born to go around the mountain and enjoy various views. That\n&gt; is fine too. But, when we advise, we advise people for the best case.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha garu, you have provided homam manuals for various deities -\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m wondering if there is any specific reason for not providing a Vaastu homam\n&gt; &gt;manual.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Another question: You always mention to start with Ganapati homam and stick\n&gt; &gt;with it for quite some time before moving on to the deity that you feel\n&gt; &gt;attracted to. You also say to stick with one god/goddess in general. But if we\n&gt; &gt;worship the same supreme power in the form of several deities, why can&#39;t we\n&gt; &gt;perform homams to several deities? For example, I love Mahalakshmi and I perform\n&gt; &gt;her homam every so often, but I&#39;d like to utilize Vaikunta Ekadashi that is\n&gt; &gt;coming up and perform Vishnu Sahasranama homam that day and god willing perform\n&gt; &gt;Kalabhairava homam on Kalabhairava ashtami. I know you never restricted anyone\n&gt; &gt;from performing this homam or that and not that I don&#39;t freely perform homams to\n&gt; &gt;different deities currently.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What I&#39;m saying is, may be the same supreme power likes to be extolled as\n&gt; &gt;Vishnu on vaikuntha ekadasi day and as Kalabhairava on kalabhairava ashtami or\n&gt; &gt;as Durga during Navratri. Adi Shankara freely praised several gods/goddesses\n&gt; &gt;depending on the day or place he happened to be at. If one sees various deities\n&gt; &gt;as the projection of the same Supreme Being, one should be able to freely\n&gt; &gt;perform any homam especially if one performs them for the love of it and not\n&gt; &gt;with any specific desire in mind. I&#39;m not suggesting that I&#39;m &quot;all there&quot; to be\n&gt; &gt;completely desire less - there has to be some innate desire behind every action,\n&gt; &gt;nevertheless for the sake of argument. Sometimes sticking to one god could also\n&gt; &gt;be binding (mentally). Don&#39;t we ultimately want to be free of bondage? Please\n&gt; &gt;enlighten me on the subject.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thank you,\n&gt; &gt; &lt;deleted&gt;\n\n\n"}}
