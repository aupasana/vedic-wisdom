The brahma=\r\nni - who was Thakur&#39;s guru - had called Gauri for a session of discussion o=\r\nn the spiritual abilities etc of Thakur. Now Gauri was a very famous debate=\r\nr and a sadhaka=C2=A0who never lost any debate. \nPlus Thakur used to say th=\r\nat Gauri had remakrable siddhis. He used to perform a homa of Ma Kali by st=\r\nretching out his left hand, piling wood on the bare=C2=A0arm, lighting it a=\r\nnd then using his right hand to pour ghee! And the homa would last for an h=\r\nour or more and he would keep his left hand perfectly still all this while.=\r\n \n=C2=A0\nHe had a certain siddhi in the use of a mantra of Ma Kali by virtu=\r\ne of which one could never win in a debate=C2=A0against him. Plus he had a =\r\ndeep, resounding voice which Ramakrishna described as the &quot;rumbling of clou=\r\nds&quot;.\n=C2=A0\nWhen Gauri entered the Dakshineshwar temple precinct and saw th=\r\ne Kali temple, he started repeating the mantra mentally. Thakur at that tim=\r\ne was coming out of the temple. On seeing Gauri suddenly Ramakrishna starte=\r\nd saying that specific mantra (the one Gauri was chanting) loudly so that G=\r\nauri could hear. Gauri, on being thus challanged=C2=A0started shouting the =\r\nmantra even louded. To this Ramakrishna felt as if someone had just given h=\r\nim a divine voice and he too thundered back. Gauri was even more amazed. He=\r\n roared again=C2=A0but Ramakrishna roared louder. Finally, suddenly Gauri r=\r\nealized he has lost his voice. And his siddhi too! \n=C2=A0\nAt first he was =\r\nfurious with anger and ego but soon he became friends with Ramakrishna. Fin=\r\nally he proclaimed that Ramakrishna was He by a fraction of whose power do =\r\nAvatars come down on earth. \n=C2=A0\nLater one day Gauri came to Ramakrishna=\r\n asking for his blessing to take sanyasa. He quit debating and went away fr=\r\nom that place, promising that he would not return untill he realized the Se=\r\nlf. Thakur also blessed him according.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nThat is the effect of =\r\nRamakrishna, who was born and brought up in a village in west bengal, who p=\r\nrobably could not even sign his own name.\n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n=\r\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\nThe upsurge (of consciousness) is Bha=\r\nirava - Shiva Sutra\n\n--- On Fri, 20/11/09, vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@yahoo=\r\n.com&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\nSubject: [vedic-=\r\nwisdom] Re: Seamless blend - To Narasimha, Siva and others !!!\nTo: vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Friday, 20 November, 2009, 2:54 AM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\n=\r\nDear Kishnendu,\n\nI beg pardon for my reply to your message addressed to Siv=\r\na.\n\n&gt; One more thing friend spirituality is not a subject of debate or &gt;dis=\r\ncussion but OF REALISATION as i feel.\n\nIt is not inappropriate to debate an=\r\nd discuss even in the matter of Spirituality occasionally. Realization may =\r\nbe the final thing but on the way, the journey is invariably subjected to m=\r\nany such things like intellectual debate, discussions, various sadhanaas et=\r\nc... Adi Shankaracharya and Swami Vivekananda, for instance, debated a lot =\r\non the subject.\n\n&gt;If you want to hear and see from someone let that be ONLY=\r\n and ONLY &gt;your GURU.\n\nThat unshakable and blind faith without complete und=\r\nerstanding of GURU&#39;s motives or anybody or any book or anything is NO FAITH=\r\n really but source of the mass production of Fanatics. The real faith also =\r\nneeds to be earned after a lot of struggle.\n\nSwami Vivekananda has said in =\r\none of his works which means that in every sect, immature Bhaktas are the r=\r\neal recruit which can be easily molded in to the fanaticism.\n\nI know one su=\r\nch Fanatic. He said that so and so person was saved in the Mumbai Train Bla=\r\nst even when he was in the same train because he was a devotee of Art of Li=\r\nving. The others died......\n\nI know another fanatic who says that Krishna i=\r\ns the only supreme God and if somebody is praying to Shiva, he is ignorant =\r\nand fool. He must pray directly to the supreme God and not the lesser Gods.=\r\n....\n\nAnother class of Fanatics believes in total that all the others who d=\r\non&#39;t believe in Islam will go to hell....and same class in another faith be=\r\nlieves that Jesus is the ONLY savior. \n\nAnd the Joke is that they are all s=\r\no called Faithful (Actually it&#39;s an abuse to the real meaning of Faith).\n\nB=\r\nest Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;chaudhuri.kris=\r\nhnen du&quot; &lt;krishnenduchdhr@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Siva,\n&gt; \n&gt; These are my per=\r\nsonal views and they maybe wrong and egoistic so i appeal of forgiveness be=\r\nfore:\n&gt; \n&gt; If you think your GURU to be GOD know that for sure that HE IS G=\r\nOD\n&gt; and let not the view of the world shake your faith.\n&gt; One more thing f=\r\nriend spirituality is not a subject of debate or discussion but OF REALISAT=\r\nION as i feel.\n&gt; You have taken your GURU or i think we take our GURU as a =\r\nladder to reach GOD&#39;S house.When you are climbing never look down to what o=\r\nthers are saying.If you want to hear and see from someone let that be ONLY =\r\nand ONLY your GURU.Either you will reach hell or you will reach heaven.But =\r\nyou will reach somewhere and will not be stranded with those persons shouti=\r\nng below.\n&gt; Wishing all the luck in your spiritual journey and may Lord Shi=\r\nva guide you through.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;vedic_pa=\r\nthak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Siva,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Narasimha&#39;s views=\r\n are to Fight/debate/ disagree/ question without PASSION. so this is an apt=\r\n thread to do some progress in that attitude.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am sorry if you fe=\r\nel sad or insulting when Sri Sri is criticized but understand that So many =\r\nmillions of Hindus would have felt the same feeling in that debate. I perso=\r\nnally admire Shivaji, Maharana Pratap and Sardar Patel and have placed them=\r\n to the highest of my ideals. Sardar Patel is the one for whom i have same =\r\nlove and respect as Thakur Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekananda or Narasimha. Why=\r\n? Because all the 3 were the ideal statesman who did us proud not only by e=\r\nffectively countering religious fanaticism but also BECAUSE THEY OPERATED I=\r\nN THE SPIRIT OF &#39;SARVA DHARMA SAMABHAVA&#39;. BIGOTRY CAN NEVER BE ATTACHED TO =\r\nTHEM. And for me this is fantastic and fitting to the ideals of Sanatan Dha=\r\nrma.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; Regarding Dr. Zakir Naik: I did not know about him in=\r\nitially. a year and half back, i visited Oman and there once i switched on =\r\nTV where in i saw that person on &#39;Peace&#39; Channel. He was lecturing in front=\r\n of a gathering and he used a word &#39;Veda&#39; which interested me to go through=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t remember the topic but i felt so much saddened by his le=\r\ncture. The reason was that he kept on attacking Veda/Hinduism and Christian=\r\nity for proving his points. Immediately in my mind came channels like &#39;Sans=\r\nkaar&#39; and &#39;Ashta&#39; where a lot of religious pundits (most of them are Hindus=\r\n) come for discourses. and i do not remember any instance where in they hav=\r\ne attacked any religious sentiments of other faiths to uphold values of San=\r\natan Dharma. there is such an obvious contrast.\n&gt; &gt; after that first lectur=\r\ne, i watched Zakir&#39;s other lectures and was convinced that this person is n=\r\not a true spiritual leader but a polished intellectual who essentially is a=\r\n fanatic and then never stopped to see him further. I remember having a deb=\r\nate at the same site (at Oman) with a Young person of Islamic faith. we deb=\r\nated on the issue and i frankly asked him to send Mr. Naik, an email, askin=\r\ng him that does he really believe that other religions and faith are also t=\r\nrue. I must say that, i found that young Muslim engineer had much more tole=\r\nrance and understanding than Dr Zakir Naik.\n&gt; &gt; The unfortunate part is tha=\r\nt the broad minded people of today&#39;s generations are getting corrupted by s=\r\nuch fanatic leaders.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; As i have many Muslim, Chrisitan Frie=\r\nnds (Really good friends), i never loose a chance to advocate my views -&quot;Th=\r\ne time has come when we must not only &#39;respect&#39; the other religious faiths =\r\nbut also we must belive in our heart of hearts that every faith/religion is=\r\n true and we must never try to convert people of other religion to our reli=\r\ngion but on the contrary we must discourage a person who wants to formally =\r\nconvert by telling him/her that yours is also right and don&#39;t get in to suc=\r\nh theatrics.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I absolutely echo Thakur Ramakrsihna- :&quot;as many are p=\r\naths, as many opinion are there&quot;\n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; About Sri Sri, i must say that=\r\n i believe him as a great spiritual leader. i&#39;ve some past experiences whic=\r\nh makes me believe that. Now that is the reason i wish to know his views on=\r\n this particular debate episode. I know he has a great knowledge and he als=\r\no is a scholar but then why he did not counter Dr. Zakir?. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Siva w=\r\nrote:\n&gt; &gt; [\n&gt; &gt; Some clues - AOL silver jubilee with over 2 million people =\r\nmeditating and doing Sudarshan Kriya together happened around Feb 16, 2006.=\r\n There were several threats from certain militants from one community about=\r\n planting bombs or disrupting it in other ways police security provided was=\r\n not sufficient for that sized gathering.\n&gt; &gt; The concerned debate where lo=\r\nt of SIMI members were among the participants happened few weeks earlier on=\r\n Jan 21, 2006.\n&gt; &gt; Some people believe Sri Sri&#39;s presence in the event chan=\r\nged the heart of some miscreants.\n&gt; &gt; ]\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was present in the Silve=\r\nr jubilee gathering in Bangalore for all the 3 days. BUT the logic of count=\r\nering threat by loosing in debate on behalf of Sanatan Dharma is very stran=\r\nge and Sri Sri must tell us what went wrong.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; Why we admire=\r\n Swami Vivekananda and feel proud whenever we remember the World religious =\r\nconference? He swept all and sundry without showing disrespect or criticizi=\r\nng on their faiths.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I sincerely wish to see such a Religious leade=\r\nr from Islamic and Christian faith who stops to see the weaknesses in own f=\r\naith and then debates with honesty and free from *converting attitudes*.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; This is the reason; i have my reservations for ISCON&#39;s propagatio=\r\nns. I had a recent debate with few of the ISCON devotees and i ended up hur=\r\nting them and ironically we all had just finished &quot;Damodar Pujan&quot; on Tulasi=\r\n vivaha day. Jay Shri Krishna...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I dont wish to give their views h=\r\nere. It sounded really foolish and i thought in my mind that what rubbish a=\r\nnd what passion with which they were arguing. i was pained by their brain w=\r\nash.\n&gt; &gt; Krishnam Vande Jagadgurum.. .Is is my opinion that many people fro=\r\nm Sanatana dharma who *love* Krishna would have kept themselves far from th=\r\nis organization.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; will Lord krishna be angry with me? :) i dont car=\r\ne because i don&#39;t FEAR THE lord but i love him. Infact one of the best pict=\r\nures in my mind about lord is that of Krishna (sky blue complexion) directi=\r\nng Arjuna on the Chariot and the other one is of that Krishna washing the f=\r\neet of his friend Sudama.\n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; I am sure my Guru will say that you c=\r\noncentrate on your saadhana and don&#39;t judge others and i will not feel bad =\r\n:).\n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I wanted to write something and ended up writing many =\r\nmore things which was probably not relevant to the thread.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sorry f=\r\nor this long and if you feel it was all rubbish, please forgive and forget!=\r\n!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yaho=\r\nogroups. com, &quot;schinnas&quot; &lt;schinnas@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Shri. Narasimh=\r\na,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I was giving an explanation from my understanding, but it was stil=\r\nl at my mental level. The actions of an englightened master established in =\r\nSahaja Samadhi does not need to satisfy our mental concepts of how things s=\r\nhould be. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; For example, when Sri Krishna - an Avatar of the hi=\r\nghest order, ran away from the battlefield when Jarasandh attacked Mathura =\r\ninstead of fighting and defeating Jarasandh. Sri Krishna himself years late=\r\nr would advice Arjuna against dropping arms in a fight. Can we give a satis=\r\nfying intellectual answer to it if people raise questions?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri=\r\n Aurobindo gave a beautiful explanation about it. It was something like: If=\r\n Krishna were constrained to win all times, that would be a limitation in i=\r\ntself! An Avatar chooses even defeat if it is necessary for a larger and mo=\r\nre complete victory in the scheme of the lela. You ofcourse have to read th=\r\ne original to get his exact words.. I read it long ago.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anothe=\r\nr instance that comes to mind - Some thieves came and beat up Ramana Mahari=\r\nshi and made a big nuisance in his Ashram. Ramana Maharishi bore it with eq=\r\nuanimity. Sri Ramana was the Spiritual head of the Ashram and one can intel=\r\nlectually argue that it was his dharma to protect the ashram and inmates fr=\r\nom the thieves. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Besides, there were certain things that I did=\r\n not want to put in an public email. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some clues - AOL silverj=\r\nubilee with over 2 million people meditating and doing sudarhsn Kriya toget=\r\nher happened around Feb 16, 2006.

Sometimes he attends some events which cannot be explai=\r\nned logically by his disciples such as the debate with Zakir Naik. The beau=\r\nty about an enlightened Master living in Sahaja Samadhi is that we cannot c=\r\nontain them in our mind. They operate from a plane of consciousness that is=\r\n much higher.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As the Mother would say if something is beyond o=\r\nur mental understanding, we can maintain a respectable silence about it. \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I do not expect my answers to satisfy all the questions. I feel=\r\n I have said everything I had to say. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In hind sight, I realiz=\r\ne that I should not have ventured to give an intellectual explanation for s=\r\nomething that I myself have not yet intellectually understood.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n I did want to object to some statements saying Sri Sri did not know what d=\r\no say or was confused. It was a judgement of those without any knowledge or=\r\n understanding of Sri Sri, just as someone who does not understand Sri Kris=\r\nhna might judge him differently for several of His acts which could not be =\r\nintellectually explained. Having observed him in person with questions seve=\r\nral times tricker than what Zakir Naik said, I can confidently say that it =\r\nwas not true. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Siva. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- I=\r\nn vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

They had the knack of steering the debat=\r\ne in a direction that they wanted - a direction that would help establish s=\r\nanatana dharma.

In fact, th=\r\nis is a question that was raised by disciples of Sri Sri than those that do=\r\nnt know him. In fact, if one looks into it, one will be dumbfounded! How is=\r\n it that somebody like Sri Sri, who has commented exhaustively on several s=\r\ncriptures, who is an authority on vedanta both by his inner Realization and=\r\n learning, who recited the Bhagavad Gita when he was 4 years old without an=\r\nybody teaching him, and who gives impromptu discourses in various forums ac=\r\nross the world on all topics under the sun shy away from explaining some si=\r\nmple questions that are about his home turf?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The answe=\r\nr is that Sri Sri did not debate. He never debates on Truth! To him Truth /=\r\n God is not an article of debate. He can show the way to Realization of Tru=\r\nth to those that are ready. He is not interested in anything else. He answe=\r\nrs only when there is sincerity in the heart of the questioner. Otherwise h=\r\ne would say some polite words and let it pass, however big the occasion may=\r\n be. Most of the questions that were raised in that meeting were answered e=\r\nlaborately by Sri Sri in his various commentaries & discourses year ago!\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One may ask why then did he go to this meeting or whatev=\r\ner it was? The topic of the meeting was something like &quot;Concept of God in H=\r\ninduism and Islam&quot;. IMHO, Sri Sri did justice to the topic by &quot;BEING&quot; an em=\r\nbodiment of the very thing that was supposedly the topic of discussion. Tho=\r\nse that were ready to benefit from it from the audience would have benefite=\r\nd. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ************\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The below part i=\r\ns not for Rajarshi but may be of interest to everyone, especially those amo=\r\nng us that are intellectually curious about spirituality than practicing it=\r\n. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Sri always practices &quot;experience first and expl=\r\nanation and knowledge later&quot; principle. Sometimes in AOL, there will be big=\r\n congregation of thousands of people and Sri Sri will only say very simple =\r\nthings or share some simple jokes and laughs, but his presence would convey=\r\n what needs to be conveyed for those that are receptive. A Master may not b=\r\ne interested in getting 100,000 people trading one mental concept for anoth=\r\ner, but prefers one sincere person opening up to Truth in silence. A Master=\r\ns mere presence is enough for that to happen. Words are secondary and optio=\r\nnal. In spiritual discussions, the point of words is to create inner silenc=\r\ne or illumination and if that is not created, there is no point in talking!=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is a great privilege and an immense blessing to b=\r\ne in the presence of a living Master whether it is Sri Sri or someone else.=\r\n We gain immensely if we listen to them from our Being instead of our mind.=\r\n In Sri Ramakrishna&#39; s life, there are innumerable examples of very simple =\r\npeople benefiting from his mere looks & presence while big intellectuals wo=\r\nuld debate with him and miss the opportunity of a lifetime. Sometimes when =\r\nhe countered insincere queries, Sri Ramakrishna would feign ignorance and s=\r\nay what would I know - I am an illiterate! What a disaster it would have be=\r\nen for a seeker if he were to label Sri Ramakrishna as an illiterate and ig=\r\nnoramus!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Without an accompanying experience (at least =\r\na small glimpse or even a fragment of an experience) accumulating knowledge=\r\n can be very dangerous as it will become yet another mental concept and wil=\r\nl actually be a hindrance to the Sadhak. Some of the most subtle and danger=\r\nous hindrances for a sadhak are created by none other than the sadhak&#39;s emp=\r\nty concepts of spirituality and God! Things like lust, greed, anger, etc., =\r\nstand out conspicuously and are in that way less dangerous. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Gurudev!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Siva.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@ yahoogroups. com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Siva,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nice mail.

I occasiona=\r\nlly visit this forum. I happened to see several emails about AOL and the be=\r\nlow email from Shri. Narasimha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a follower of AOL&#39;s spirit=\r\nual practices and as a disciple and devotee of Sri Sri Ravishankar, I want =\r\nto clarify a few things to the extent of my understanding.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are several paths each leading to the destination of Sat=\r\n-Chit-Ananda. Some are ritualistic, some use austerities, some use devotion=\r\n, etc. AOL is a path, where the path to Bliss is also blissful. That does n=\r\not make it in any way inferior to paths of austerities. As Sri Aurobindo wo=\r\nuld call it, it is a &quot;Sunlit path&quot;. In this path one does not suddenly emer=\r\nge into SatChitAnanda. The personality of the sadhak is transformed slowly =\r\nand the sadhak radiates more and more as they progress more and more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my experience, AOL is a seamless blend of Raja y=\r\noga, Bhakti yoga, Karma yoga and Gnana yoga. Spritual practice in AOL is no=\r\nt just doing Sudarshan Kriya everyday as it is commonly (mis)understood. Pr=\r\nanayams and Sudarshan Kriya are done for cleansing and settling of the mind=\r\n and preparing for meditation and doing other spiritual practices of contem=\r\nplation, Seva for rest of the day wit the right attitude. Regular practice =\r\nof Sudarshan Kriya removes / breaks old patterns and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; AOL includes some yoga asanas to prepare the body (the Padma Sadhana=\r\n sequence of asanas taught in DSN course and Sun Salutations (Surya Namaska=\r\nr) taught in Part II or advance courses fall under this category.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The raja yoga practices include all the pranayams, Suda=\r\nrshan Kriya, mudras, bandhas, meditations taught in Art of Living course, a=\r\ndvance courses, Sahaj samadhi meditation course, etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Knowledge part includes deep contemplative study and imbibing o=\r\nf Narada Bhakti Sutras, Patanjali Yoga Sutras, Ashtavakra Gita and Bhagavat=\r\n Gita. Sri Sri Ravishankar has given very elaborate commentary on all of th=\r\ne above. His commentary on Bhakti Sutras runs to 30 or so tapes and the pub=\r\nlicly available commentary on Ashtavakra gita runs to over 33 DVD episodes!=\r\n Besides daily study of Yoga Vashishtam is highly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recommended=\r\n. Learning and contemplation of this Wisdom is mandatory for those that str=\r\nive to become Art of Living teachers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The path=\r\n of AOL emphasises on Surrender and Seva. Guru puja to Guru parampara, nama=\r\n sankeertan and bhajans are a standard feature of AOL satsangs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some wonder why AOL charges for these courses and some wo=\r\nnder about lack of a Sadhguru at every stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nLet me clarify from my personal experiences that Sri Sri Ravishankar is a f=\r\nully Enlightened Master living in Sahaj Samadhi all times. He is capable of=\r\n guiding millions of devotees in every step of the sadhana without having t=\r\no be near them in person. Several get necessary guidance in dreams (I mysel=\r\nf had that experience twice), some in person and several via various other =\r\nways. However, to get these guidance, an inner connection with the Master i=\r\ns essential. Until that stage, the various AOL courses, Sri Sri&#39;s elaborate=\r\n and in-depth commentaries on various Knowledge are more than enough to gui=\r\nde disciples to a stage where conscious inner communion with Guru can be es=\r\ntablished.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Several of the senior AOL teachers =\r\n(mostly Swamis and Rishis) are yogis of a very high order capable of reachi=\r\nng SatChitAnanda consciousness at will during meditation. They may be not f=\r\nully established in it like Sri Sri, but act as channels of the SatGuru and=\r\n can appropriate guide a Sadhak as and when needed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is very easy to accept those that left their body as having achiev=\r\ned highest realization such as Sri Aurobindo or Sri Ramakrishna or Ramana M=\r\naharishi. However it is a human tendency to doubt them when they are in phy=\r\nsical form.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding AOL charging money for i=\r\nts courses: AOL is world&#39;s largest volunteer run organization. Neither AOL =\r\nteachers nor its founder Sri Sri Ravishankar make monitory profits. All the=\r\n proceeds go to the charitable activities again run by volunteers. Many of =\r\nthe full time teachers have given up veyr lucrative careers and millions wo=\r\nrth in property to become teachers and teach for free. Sri Sri Ravishankar =\r\nneither needs all the money. All senior AOL teachers including Sri Sri have=\r\n went through very bad and sometimes even dangerous conditions to bring the=\r\n Knowledge to the masses. This is a time when the highest Knowledge needs t=\r\no be revealed to maximum number of people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sen=\r\nior AOL teachers have faced danger to their lives by going without any help=\r\n or guidance to areas infested with naxalites, terrorists in North East, Ka=\r\nshmir, Iraq, Palestine, Pakitan, Sri Lanka, etc. with nothing but love and =\r\nDivine Grace as their aid.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As far as I know, m=\r\noney is charged in AOL courses for two reasons.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; 1) Past experience showed that those that paid for the courses seem to fo=\r\nllow the practices more diligently. It is Sri Sri&#39;s guidance that no deserv=\r\ning person should be denied a course because they cannot afford to pay. As =\r\na volunteer, I was part of organizing several AOL courses and know first ha=\r\nnd many cases where people took courses for free and were also provided fre=\r\ne accommodation, etc. Whenever natural disaster strikes, AOL teachers go th=\r\nere paying from their own pocket or by AOL and teach courses for free and p=\r\nrovide healing to the victims. AOL does not advertise it or make a show of =\r\nit.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) This is my understanding and not AOl po=\r\nsition. It removes the Karmic debt to the AOL teachers and volunteers who s=\r\ntill may have some doership in them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, =\r\nSri Sri is only interested in getting everyone turn inwards and express the=\r\n love, joy and compassion that is inside everyone. As long as one follows a=\r\n path, any path and surrenders to any Sat Guru, we are happy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Gurudev!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Siva.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n      The INTERNET now has a personality.

The br=\r\nahmani - who was Thakur&#39;s guru - had called Gauri for a session of discussi=\r\non on the spiritual abilities etc of Thakur. Now Gauri was a very famous de=\r\nbater and a sadhaka&nbsp;who never lost any debate. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Plus Thakur=\r\n used to say that Gauri had remakrable siddhis. He used to perform a homa o=\r\nf Ma Kali by stretching out his left hand, piling wood on the bare&nbsp;arm=\r\n, lighting it and then using his right hand to pour ghee! And the homa woul=\r\nd last for an hour or more and he would keep his left hand perfectly still =\r\nall this while. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;He had a certain siddhi in th=\r\ne use of a mantra of Ma Kali by virtue of which one could never win in a de=\r\nbate&nbsp;against him. Plus he had a deep, resounding voice which Ramakrish=\r\nna described as the &quot;rumbling of clouds&quot;.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;When=\r\n Gauri entered the Dakshineshwar temple precinct and saw the Kali temple, h=\r\ne started repeating the mantra mentally. Thakur at that time was coming out=\r\n of the temple. On seeing Gauri suddenly Ramakrishna started saying that sp=\r\necific mantra (the one Gauri was chanting) loudly so that Gauri could hear.=\r\n Gauri, on being thus challanged&nbsp;started shouting the mantra even loud=\r\ned. To this Ramakrishna felt as if someone had just given him a divine voic=\r\ne and he too thundered back. Gauri was even more amazed. He roared again&nb=\r\nsp;but Ramakrishna roared louder. Finally, suddenly Gauri realized he has l=\r\nost his voice. And his siddhi too! &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;At first h=\r\ne was furious with anger and ego but soon he became friends with Ramakrishn=\r\na.

Realization may be the final thing b=\r\nut on the way, the journey is invariably subjected to many such things like=\r\n intellectual debate, discussions, various sadhanaas etc...

He must pray directly to the supreme God and not=\r\n the lesser Gods.....&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Another class of Fanatics believes in total th=\r\nat all the others who don&#39;t believe in Islam will go to hell....and same cl=\r\nass in another faith believes that Jesus is the ONLY savior. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And th=\r\ne Joke is that they are all so called Faithful (Actually it&#39;s an abuse to t=\r\nhe real meaning of Faith).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Utpal&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In =\r\n&lt;A\n href=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40ya=\r\nhoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdo=\r\nm%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;chaudhuri.krishne=\r\nn du&quot; &lt;krishnenduchdhr@ ...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear Siva,&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; These are my personal views and they maybe wrong and egoistic so=\r\n i appeal of forgiveness before:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If you think your GURU to=\r\n be GOD know that for sure that HE IS GOD&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and let not the view of t=\r\nhe world shake your faith.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; One more thing friend spirituality is no=\r\nt a subject of debate or discussion but OF REALISATION as i feel.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Y=\r\nou have taken your GURU or i think we take our GURU as a ladder to reach GO=\r\nD&#39;S house.When you are climbing never look down to what others are saying.I=\r\nf you want to hear and see from someone let that be ONLY and ONLY your GURU=\r\n.Either you will reach hell or you will reach heaven.But you will reach som=\r\newhere\n and will not be stranded with those persons shouting below.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Wishing all the luck in your spiritual journey and may Lord Shiva guide yo=\r\nu through.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.mail.yahoo.com=\r\n/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofo=\r\nllow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoog=\r\nroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@ &gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Siva,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha&#39;s views are to =\r\nFight/debate/ disagree/ question without PASSION. so this is an apt thread =\r\nto do some progress in that attitude.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I am sorry=\r\n if you feel sad or insulting when Sri Sri is criticized but understand tha=\r\nt So many millions of Hindus would have felt the same feeling in that debat=\r\ne. I personally admire Shivaji, Maharana Pratap and Sardar Patel and have p=\r\nlaced them to the highest of my ideals. Sardar Patel is the one for whom i =\r\nhave same\n love and respect as Thakur Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekananda or Nar=\r\nasimha. Why? Because all the 3 were the ideal statesman who did us proud no=\r\nt only by effectively countering religious fanaticism but also BECAUSE THEY=\r\n OPERATED IN THE SPIRIT OF &#39;SARVA DHARMA SAMABHAVA&#39;. BIGOTRY CAN NEVER BE A=\r\nTTACHED TO THEM. And for me this is fantastic and fitting to the ideals of =\r\nSanatan Dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ***&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Regarding Dr. Z=\r\nakir Naik: I did not know about him initially. a year and half back, i visi=\r\nted Oman and there once i switched on TV where in i saw that person on &#39;Pea=\r\nce&#39; Channel. He was lecturing in front of a gathering and he used a word &#39;V=\r\neda&#39; which interested me to go through.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t =\r\nremember the topic but i felt so much saddened by his lecture. The reason w=\r\nas that he kept on attacking Veda/Hinduism and Christianity for proving his=\r\n points. Immediately in my mind came channels like &#39;Sanskaar&#39; and &#39;Ashta&#39;\n =\r\nwhere a lot of religious pundits (most of them are Hindus) come for discour=\r\nses. and i do not remember any instance where in they have attacked any rel=\r\nigious sentiments of other faiths to uphold values of Sanatan Dharma. there=\r\n is such an obvious contrast.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; after that first lecture, i watc=\r\nhed Zakir&#39;s other lectures and was convinced that this person is not a true=\r\n spiritual leader but a polished intellectual who essentially is a fanatic =\r\nand then never stopped to see him further. I remember having a debate at th=\r\ne same site (at Oman) with a Young person of Islamic faith. we debated on t=\r\nhe issue and i frankly asked him to send Mr. Naik, an email, asking him tha=\r\nt does he really believe that other religions and faith are also true. I mu=\r\nst say that, i found that young Muslim engineer had much more tolerance and=\r\n understanding than Dr Zakir Naik.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The unfortunate part is tha=\r\nt the broad minded people of today&#39;s generations are getting\n corrupted by =\r\nsuch fanatic leaders.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ***&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; As i have=\r\n many Muslim, Chrisitan Friends (Really good friends), i never loose a chan=\r\nce to advocate my views -&quot;The time has come when we must not only &#39;respect&#39;=\r\n the other religious faiths but also we must belive in our heart of hearts =\r\nthat every faith/religion is true and we must never try to convert people o=\r\nf other religion to our religion but on the contrary we must discourage a p=\r\nerson who wants to formally convert by telling him/her that yours is also r=\r\night and don&#39;t get in to such theatrics.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I absol=\r\nutely echo Thakur Ramakrsihna- :&quot;as many are paths, as many opinion are the=\r\nre&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ***&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; About Sri Sri, i must say that i believe =\r\nhim as a great spiritual leader. i&#39;ve some past experiences which makes me =\r\nbelieve that. Now that is the reason i wish to know his views on this parti=\r\ncular debate episode. I know he has a great knowledge\n and he also is a sch=\r\nolar but then why he did not counter Dr. Zakir?. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; Siva wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; [&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Some clues - AOL silver jubilee w=\r\nith over 2 million people meditating and doing Sudarshan Kriya together hap=\r\npened around Feb 16, 2006.

Narasimha,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; I was giving an explanation from my understanding, but it was still=\r\n at my mental level. The actions of an englightened master established in S=\r\nahaja Samadhi does not need to satisfy our mental concepts of how things sh=\r\nould be. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; For example, when Sri Krishn=\r\na - an Avatar of the highest order, ran away from the battlefield when Jara=\r\nsandh attacked Mathura instead of fighting and defeating Jarasandh. Sri Kri=\r\nshna himself years later would advice Arjuna against dropping arms in a fig=\r\nht. Can we give a satisfying intellectual answer to it if people raise ques=\r\ntions?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Aurobindo gave a beautiful=\r\n explanation about it. It was something like: If Krishna were constrained t=\r\no win all times, that would be a limitation in itself! An Avatar chooses ev=\r\nen defeat if it is necessary for a larger and more complete victory in the =\r\nscheme of the lela. You ofcourse have to read the original to get his exact=\r\n words.. I read it long ago.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Another i=\r\nnstance that comes to mind - Some thieves came and beat up Ramana Maharishi=\r\n and made a big nuisance in his Ashram. Ramana Maharishi bore it with equan=\r\nimity. Sri Ramana was the Spiritual head of the Ashram and one can intellec=\r\ntually argue that it was his dharma to protect the ashram and inmates from =\r\nthe thieves. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Besides, there were cert=\r\nain things that I did not want to put in an public email. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Some clues - AOL silverjubilee with over 2 million peo=\r\nple\n meditating and doing sudarhsn Kriya together happened around Feb 16, 2=\r\n006.

Sometimes he=\r\n attends some events which cannot be explained logically by his disciples s=\r\nuch as the debate with Zakir Naik. The beauty about an enlightened Master l=\r\niving in Sahaja Samadhi is that we cannot contain them in our mind. They\n o=\r\nperate from a plane of consciousness that is much higher.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; As the Mother would say if something is beyond our ment=\r\nal understanding, we can maintain a respectable silence about it. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I do not expect my answers to satisfy all the =\r\nquestions. I feel I have said everything I had to say. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; In hind sight, I realize that I should not have ventured =\r\nto give an intellectual explanation for something that I myself have not ye=\r\nt intellectually understood.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I did wan=\r\nt to object to some statements saying Sri Sri did not know what do say or w=\r\nas confused. It was a judgement of those without any knowledge or understan=\r\nding of Sri Sri, just as someone who does not understand Sri Krishna might =\r\njudge him differently for several of His acts which could not be intellectu=\r\nally explained. Having observed him in person with questions\n several times=\r\n tricker than what Zakir Naik said, I can confidently say that it was not t=\r\nrue. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n -Siva. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.m=\r\nc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;=\r\nvedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

IMHO, Sri Sri did justice to the topic by &quot;BEING&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an embodiment of the very thing that was supposedly the topi=\r\nc of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discussion.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; If a yogi has such stature, one can do &quot;justice to the top=\r\nic&quot; without even taking part in the debate and just by being oneself.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When people of little or no understanding were debating=\r\n Truth/God and misleading the world, great teachers in the past stepped in =\r\nand directed the debate in the right direction, whether it is rishis or rec=\r\nently Aadi Shankaracharya or Swami Vivekananda. They\n had the knack of stee=\r\nring the debate in a direction that they wanted - a direction that would he=\r\nlp establish sanatana dharma.

In fact, this is a question that was r=\r\naised by disciples of Sri Sri than those that dont know him. In fact, if on=\r\ne looks into it, one will be dumbfounded! How is it that somebody like Sri =\r\nSri, who has commented exhaustively on several scriptures, who is an author=\r\nity on vedanta both by his inner Realization and learning, who recited the =\r\nBhagavad Gita when he was 4 years old without anybody teaching him, and who=\r\n gives impromptu discourses in various forums across the world on all topic=\r\ns under the sun shy away from explaining some simple questions that are\n ab=\r\nout his home turf?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n The answer is that Sri Sri did not debate. He never debates on Truth! To h=\r\nim Truth / God is not an article of debate. He can show the way to Realizat=\r\nion of Truth to those that are ready. He is not interested in anything else=\r\n. He answers only when there is sincerity in the heart of the questioner. O=\r\ntherwise he would say some polite words and let it pass, however big the oc=\r\ncasion may be. Most of the questions that were raised in that meeting were =\r\nanswered elaborately by Sri Sri in his various commentaries &amp; discourse=\r\ns year ago!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One ma=\r\ny ask why then did he go to this meeting or whatever it was? The topic of t=\r\nhe meeting was something like &quot;Concept of God in Hinduism and Islam&quot;. IMHO,=\r\n Sri Sri did justice to the topic by &quot;BEING&quot; an embodiment of the very thin=\r\ng that was supposedly the topic of discussion. Those that were\n ready to be=\r\nnefit from it from the audience would have benefited. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ************&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The below part is not for Rajarshi but may =\r\nbe of interest to everyone, especially those among us that are intellectual=\r\nly curious about spirituality than practicing it. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Sri always practices &quot;experience first=\r\n and explanation and knowledge later&quot; principle. Sometimes in AOL, there wi=\r\nll be big congregation of thousands of people and Sri Sri will only say ver=\r\ny simple things or share some simple jokes and laughs, but his presence wou=\r\nld convey what needs to be conveyed for those that are receptive. A Master =\r\nmay not be interested in getting 100,000 people trading one mental concept =\r\nfor another, but prefers one sincere person opening up to Truth in silence.=\r\n A Masters mere presence is enough for that to happen.\n Words are secondary=\r\n and optional. In spiritual discussions, the point of words is to create in=\r\nner silence or illumination and if that is not created, there is no point i=\r\nn talking! &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is =\r\na great privilege and an immense blessing to be in the presence of a living=\r\n Master whether it is Sri Sri or someone else. We gain immensely if we list=\r\nen to them from our Being instead of our mind. In Sri Ramakrishna&#39; s life, =\r\nthere are innumerable examples of very simple people benefiting from his me=\r\nre looks &amp; presence while big intellectuals would debate with him and m=\r\niss the opportunity of a lifetime. Sometimes when he countered insincere qu=\r\neries, Sri Ramakrishna would feign ignorance and say what would I know - I =\r\nam an illiterate! What a disaster it would have been for a seeker if he wer=\r\ne to label Sri Ramakrishna as an illiterate and ignoramus!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Without\n an accompanying experienc=\r\ne (at least a small glimpse or even a fragment of an experience) accumulati=\r\nng knowledge can be very dangerous as it will become yet another mental con=\r\ncept and will actually be a hindrance to the Sadhak. Some of the most subtl=\r\ne and dangerous hindrances for a sadhak are created by none other than the =\r\nsadhak&#39;s empty concepts of spirituality and God! Things like lust, greed, a=\r\nnger, etc., stand out conspicuously and are in that way less dangerous. &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Gurudev!&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Siva.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dve=\r\ndic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mai=\r\nlto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, raj=\r\narshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Siva,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nice mail. However I have one iss=\r\nue with Sri Ravishankar. Why did he accept to debate the infamous Zakir Nai=\r\nk on Hinduism? Sri Sri Ravishankar maybe an enlightened master but he just =\r\ncannot debate. If you see the vedios of that debate that happened a couple =\r\nof years back, you will find Sri Ravishanker utterly clueless on stage, not=\r\n knowing what and how to counter the polemical queries of the Zakir Naik.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No=\r\nw when Sri Sri choses to accept an offer to debate Naik on stage, he does n=\r\not=C3=82 go there merely in his=C3=82 own capacity but as a representative =\r\nof the religion - Hinduism. And when he fails miserably on stage, it become=\r\ns shameful to watch for hindus.
