It is a metabolic disorder. Gout =\r\n\noccurs more frequently in males, usually in middle life.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Gout te=\r\nnds to run in families. In all cases there is too much \nuric acid in the bl=\r\nood. This excess uric acid is deposited in some \nof the soft tissues of the=\r\n body and also around certain joints. This \nresults in painful swellings, k=\r\nnown as tophi, which are most likely \nto develop in cartilage, such as in t=\r\nhe outer ear. They also occur \nin the synovial membranes of such joints as =\r\nthe knees and ankles and \nparticularly the big toe and also in various tend=\r\nons and bursae. \nEven the ends of some bones may be invaded by these tophi.=\r\n\n&gt;    \n&gt;   This may be the result of wearing ill-fitting shoes or tight \ngl=\r\noves. It may also follow a heavy meal, or overindulgence in rich \nfoods or =\r\nalcohol. It sometimes comes on after a surgical operation, \nor after an acu=\r\nte infection of the nose or throat. Severe pain may \ndevelop at the base of=\r\n the big toe, usually in the middle of the \nnight. Several joints, such as =\r\nthe ankle or knee, may also be \naffected at the same time.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   The pa=\r\nin becomes more severe as fluid collects in the joint \nspace and in the sur=\r\nrounding soft tissues. The skin is tense, hot, \nand shining, and is of a re=\r\nd or purplish color. The patient is \nlikely to have chills and fever, a rap=\r\nid pulse, and feelings of \ngeneral weakness. Severe attacks may continue fo=\r\nr several weeks, \nmilder attacks usually last only a few days. Repeated att=\r\nacks may \noccur each year, gradually becoming more severe and prolonged.\n&gt; =\r\n   \n&gt;   Any person suffering from acute joint pain who is otherwise \nhealth=\r\ny should be tested for gout. There are times when gout may \nstimulate rheum=\r\natic fever, but this disease is more likely to attack \nlarger joints, while=\r\n gout tends to involve the smaller joints.\n&gt;   Gout Symptoms  Acute pain in=\r\n the toe, swelling  The most common \nGout symptom is acute pain in the big =\r\ntoe, which becomes tender, \nhot, and swollen in a few hours. It may also si=\r\nmilarly affect other \njoints such as the knees and wrists, and sometimes mo=\r\nre than one \njoint may be affected at a time. The attack, usually occurs at=\r\n \nmidnight or in the early hours of the morning when the patient is \nsudden=\r\nly awakened. The acute attack generally lasts for a week or \nso. During thi=\r\ns period, the patient may run a slight fever, and feel \ndisinclined to eat.=\r\n A serious complication of gout is the presence \nof kidney stones containin=\r\ng uric acid. In some cases the kidneys get \ndamaged and do not function pro=\r\nperly. \n&gt;   Causes of Gout  Gout caused due to Uric Acid Crystals  One of \n=\r\nmain causes of gout is the formation of uric acid crystals in the \njoints, =\r\nskin, and kidneys. Uric acid is an end product of the body&#39;s \nchemical proc=\r\nesses. Those affected by gout have a higher level of \nuric acid in the bloo=\r\nd than the normal, due either to formation of \nincreased amounts or reduced=\r\n amounts of acid being passed out by the \nkidneys in the urine. This uric a=\r\ncid usually remains dissolved in \nthe blood. But when the blood becomes too=\r\n full of it, the uric acid \nforms needle-shaped crystals in the joints whic=\r\nh bring about attacks \nof gout.\n&gt;   Excessive alcohol, heredity, rich foods=\r\n, lack of exercise also \ncauses gout  Other causes of gout are heredity, al=\r\ncoholic drinks, \nregular eating of foods rich in protein and carbohydrate, =\r\nlack of \nproper exercise, and stress.\n&gt;   HOME REMEDIES FOR GOUT   Treating=\r\n gout using Cherry  The cherry, \nsweet or sour, is considered in effective =\r\ntreating gout. To start \nwith, the patient should consume about fifteen to =\r\ntwenty five \ncherries a day. Thereafter, about ten cherries a day will keep=\r\n the \nailment under control. While fresh cherries are best, canned \ncherrie=\r\ns can also be used occasionally.\n&gt;   Gout treatment using Vegetable Juices =\r\n Raw vegetable juices are \nused for gout treatment. Carrot juice, in combin=\r\nation with the \njuices of beet and cucumber, is especially valuable. Beet j=\r\nuice - \n100 ml and cucumber juice - 100 ml should be mixed with 300 ml of \n=\r\ncarrot juice to make 500 ml of combined juice and taken daily\n&gt;   Treating =\r\nGout using French Beans  The juice of French or string \nbeans has also prov=\r\ned effective in treating gout. About 150 ml of \nthis juice should be taken =\r\ndaily by the patient suffering from this \ndisease.\n&gt;   Cure for Gout using =\r\nApple  Apples are regarded as an excellent \nsource for curing gout. The mal=\r\nic acid contained in them is believed \nto neutralise the uric acid and affo=\r\nrd relief to gout sufferers. The \npatient is advised to take one apple afte=\r\nr each meal.\n&gt;   Gout relief using Banana  Bananas have been found benefici=\r\nal in \nthe treatment of gout. A diet of bananas only for three or four days=\r\n \nis advised for providing some relief from gout. A patient can take \neight=\r\n or nine bananas daily during this period and nothing else.\n&gt;   Treating go=\r\nut using Lime  Lime is also used as a source in \ntreating gout. Vitamin C i=\r\ns known to prevent and cure sore joints by \nstrengthening the connective ti=\r\nssues of the body. The citric acid \nfound in lime is a solvent of the uric =\r\nacid which is the primary \ncause of this disease. The juice of half a lime,=\r\n squeezed into a \nglass of water, should be taken twice daily.\n&gt;     \n&gt;    =\r\nAvoid alcohol , protein , heavy foods , coffee and soft drinks \nin your die=\r\nt. These foods cause uric acid levels to rise.   \n&gt;    Simple sugars, simpl=\r\ne carbohydrates and saturated fats - they \nincrease your body&#39;s production =\r\nof uric acid and impair your \nkidneys&#39; ability to get rid of it. Eliminate =\r\nfructose (found in food \nand drinks, like sodas).   \n&gt;    For natural gout =\r\ntreatment, eat foods high in potassium   \n&gt;    Lemon juice prevents gout at=\r\ntacks by stimulating the formation \nof calcium carbonate in the body.   \n&gt; =\r\n   Taking =BD teaspoon of baking soda with meals will prevent gout \nattacks=\r\n. This will help alkalize the body.   \n&gt;    Press and massage between the b=\r\nall of the foot and the bottom \nof the big toe on each foot; then on the le=\r\nft foot only, stimulate a \npoint halfway between the base of the little toe=\r\n and the heel pad.   \n&gt;    Alfalfa is a good source of minerals and other n=\r\nutrients that \nhelp reduce serum uric acid.   \n&gt;    For natural gout treatm=\r\nent, add some rose hips to vinegar and \nboil; apply on affected area.   \n&gt; =\r\n   Prepare a mixture by adding two teaspoons each of apple cider \nvinegar a=\r\nnd raw honey in a glass of water and drink at mealtime.   \n&gt;    Soak the fo=\r\not in a mixture of =BD cup of apple cider vinegar and \nthree cups of hot wa=\r\nter.   \n&gt;    Get some natural, concentrated black cherry juice and drink \ns=\r\neveral tablespoons of the concentrate daily.   \n&gt;    Blueberries are high i=\r\nn anti-inflammatory compounds called \nanthocyanins, which help to relieve t=\r\nhe pain of gout.   \n&gt;    Buchu tea helps dissolve and flush out uric acid c=\r\nrystals.   \n&gt;    Soak a piece of white flannel in warm castor oil, wring it=\r\n out \nand place over the affected area; cover with plastic wrap and apply \n=\r\na heating pad. Do this for one hour twice daily.   \n&gt;    Boil one tablespoo=\r\nn of pepper in 1 cup of vinegar and 1 cup of \nwater and apply on the painfu=\r\nl joint.   \n&gt;    Cook a tablespoon of celery seeds in two cups of water unt=\r\nil \nthey are soft; strain and drink 1/2 cup four times a day.   \n&gt;    Take =\r\n=BD-1 teaspoon of activated charcoal daily. This is very \neffective home re=\r\nmedy for gout.   \n&gt;    Prepare a poultice using =BD cup of activated charco=\r\nal, 3 \ntablespoons of ground flaxseed and warm water to excrete toxins from=\r\n \nthe body.   \n&gt;    Eat several cloves of raw garlic daily.   \n&gt;    Put 1/3=\r\n cup of ground ginger in a bathtub of water and soak for \n30 minutes. This =\r\nwill cause you to sweat, which will help eliminate \nthe uric acid from your=\r\n tissues.   \n&gt;    Grapes are high in alkalines, which lessen the acidity of=\r\n uric \nacid and helps in its elimination from the body.   \n&gt;    Apply an ic=\r\ne pack for ten minutes, and then alternate with a \nmoist hot-towel compress=\r\n, to soothe and numb the pain.   \n&gt;    Soak mullein leaves in a hot vinegar=\r\n/water mixture. Pack the \nleaves on the affected area.   \n&gt;    Prepare a po=\r\nultice of spearmint leaves and wrap the affected \narea. This is also very e=\r\nffective home remedy for gout.   \n&gt;    Eating a cup of strawberries with ea=\r\nch meal should bring quick \nrelief. They neutralize uric acid.   \n&gt;    Prep=\r\nare a tea by using equal parts of yarrow and stinging \nnettles; strain, coo=\r\nl and drink several cups a day.   \n&gt;    Eat an apple after every meal. This=\r\n is very helpful in natural \ncure for gout.   \n&gt;    Take the juice of =BD a=\r\n lime in 1 glass of water. Drink this \nmorning, noon and night.   \n&gt;    Ext=\r\nract =BD a cup of juice of French beans (String beans). Drink \nthis juice e=\r\nveryday for a month.   \n&gt;    Apply a frozen cabbage leaf to the area and co=\r\nver with a dry \ntowel. Leave in place until the leaf thaws out and repeat. =\r\n  \n&gt;    Drinking lots of water will help kidneys flush out the excess \nuric=\r\n acid.   \n&gt;    Meats having high protein content, such as fish (herrings, \n=\r\nsalmons and sardines), sweet bread, liver, kidney, milk extracts and \nmeat =\r\nsoup should be avoided. \n&gt;   Gout Diet\n&gt;   Fast of Orange juice and water  =\r\nFor an acute attack, there is no \nbetter remedy than a fast of orange juice=\r\n and water. In severe \ncases, it is advisable to undertake a series of shor=\r\nt fasts for \nthree days or so rather than one long fast.\n&gt;   All fruit diet=\r\n  After the acute symptoms subside, the patient \nmay adopt an all fruit die=\r\nt for another three or four days.\n&gt;   Natural food diet  Thereafter, he may=\r\n gradually embark upon a \nwell-balanced diet of natural foods, with emphasi=\r\ns on fresh fruits, \nraw vegetables, and sprouts.\n&gt;   Avoid purine and acid =\r\nproducing foods  The patient should avoid \nall purine and uric acid-produci=\r\nng foods such as all meats, eggs, \nand fish; tea, coffee, sugar, white flou=\r\nr and its products; and all \ncanned, processed, and fried foods.\n&gt;   Other =\r\nGout Treatment  Warm water enema  A warm-water enema \nshould be used daily =\r\nduring the period of fasting to cleanse the \nbowels.\n&gt;   Epsom salt bath  E=\r\npsom salts foot baths are advised twice daily. \nAbout 250 gm - 500gm of the=\r\nse salts may be added to tolerably hot \nwater for this purpose. Full Epsom =\r\nsalt baths should also be taken \nthree times a week. The baths may be reduc=\r\ned to two per week later.\n&gt;   Cold packs, fresh air, exercise, reduced stre=\r\nss  Cold packs, \napplied to the affected joints at night, will be beneficia=\r\nl. Fresh \nair and outdoor exercise are also essential. The patient should \n=\r\neliminate as much stress from his life as possible\n&gt;   Regds.\n&gt;   K.V.Vighn=\r\nesh\n&gt;   Chennai-India\n&gt;   mbl: 9444961820\n&gt;   yahoo id: kvvighnesh@... \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;        \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt;  Did you know?
