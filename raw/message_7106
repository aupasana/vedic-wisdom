Brahman is satya & jagat 2 is satya.\n&gt;&gt; Neither mirror no=\r\nr ur image in it r &quot;illusions&quot;. They r &quot;real&quot;. But \n&gt;&gt; ur thinking 1/2\n&gt;&gt; t=\r\nhat ur image in mirror is ur extension is an illusion.\n&gt;&gt; Excitement/sadnes=\r\ns abt things happenin 2 d mirror image is an \n&gt;&gt; illusion.2/2\n\nThe followin=\r\ng question was asked by private email:\n\n&gt; Can you please clarify the concep=\r\nt of satya & non-mithya in light of\n&gt; Vasishtha&#39;s words in Yoga Vasishtha (=\r\n2.3.11 - 2.3.18)?\n\n*        *        *\n\nObviously my tweets were from a lim=\r\nited context. To say that jagat is \nsatya is, strictly speaking, against sc=\r\nripture. When my mind making \nthese statements and your mind trying to abso=\r\nrb them are part of this \njagat, what is the point in declaring that jagat =\r\nis mithya, even if that \nwere true? It sends the message &quot;all this is an il=\r\nlusion and so whatever \nI do does not matter&quot;. Instead, my message is &quot;this=\r\n is not an illusion \nand real. But you are corrupting the reality with illu=\r\nsions. Weed out \nthe illusions.&quot; Once someone actually starts to weed out a=\r\nll obvious \nillusions, eventually one realizes that everything other than \n=\r\nunconditioned Self is an illusion anyway.\n\n*        *        *\n\nSo I took t=\r\nhe approach of accepting that the world is a reality and then \nrejecting th=\r\nings that can be deduced to be illusions.\n\nFor example, let me assume that =\r\n&quot;I, Narasimha Rao, an individual being \nin this world&quot; is not an illusion a=\r\nnd a valid and true entity. I can \nfirst accept it to be real and then star=\r\nt analyzing various extensions \nof that entity. For example, people&#39;s views=\r\n on this entity are formed \nbased on an impression/reflection of this entit=\r\ny in their minds, which \nis influenced by this entity to some extent, but n=\r\not fully. Just as my \nreflection in different mirrors may look different ba=\r\nsed on the colors, \ndust, refractive properties etc of the mirrors etc, my =\r\nreflection in \ndifferent minds may be different. Just as I cannot think tha=\r\nt my \nreflections in all mirrors around me are extensions of myself and sta=\r\nrt \ncelebrating or ruing anything happeneing to those reflections, so shoul=\r\nd \nI not think that my reflections in the minds of people around me are \nex=\r\ntensions of myself and start celebrating or ruing anything happening \nto th=\r\nose reflections!\n\nThus, I can reject a lot of notions that I may tend to ha=\r\nng on to, as an \nillusion. This is what I am saying above. I may not be an =\r\nillusion, a \nmirror (mind of someone) may not be an illusion, my image in t=\r\nhe mirror \n(that person&#39;s notion of who I am) may not be an illusion, BUT m=\r\ny \nthinking that my image in the mirror is an extension of my personality \n=\r\nis an illusion.\n\nSimilarly, we build complicated structures in our own mind=\r\ns regarding \nvarious external objects our senses perceive. When senses perc=\r\neive those \nobjects, mind thinks of a notional being that is far more compl=\r\nicated \nthan the objective reality represented by it! It is influenced by m=\r\nany \nnotions arising in our conditioning and not just based on the concrete=\r\n \nobjective reality. Again, such notions can be identified and rejected as =\r\n\nillusions.\n\nAs you identify and reject each layer of obvious illusion abou=\r\nt your \nsense of who you are, who/what you are dealing with, you eventually=\r\n \nrealize unconditioned Self. Until then, &quot;jaganmithya&quot; is a meaningless \na=\r\nnd also perhaps a dangerous notion.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Softw=\r\nare, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manual=\r\ns for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAst=\r\nrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n =\r\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish wr=\r\nitings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                     =\r\n Twitter ID: @homam108\n----------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Jagat isnt mithya.
