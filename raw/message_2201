Imbibing true\nreligion connotes absorbing those principles which =\r\nare universally\nacceptable at all times by world humanity. Space, time nor =\r\nreligious sects\ncan ever influence them. Barring those rare exceptions, all=\r\n world religions\ndirectly or indirectly inspire their followers, to imbibe =\r\nthese principles\nand actually put them into practice in their day to day li=\r\nves. If only all\nreligious leaders of the world continue to urge their foll=\r\nowers to do this\nknow for sure that human glory will climb great peaks. In =\r\nthis manner apt\nsocial governance is totally dependent on this axis.\n\nWe ha=\r\nve already said that these 4 precepts demarcate the various streams of\nsoci=\r\nal life. In order that the layman imbibes these and puts them into\npractice=\r\n he must be given knowledge regarding the various classifications of\neach p=\r\nrecept. No doubt if we delve deep very minutely the number of these\nclassif=\r\nications will be so high that a layman=92s mind will be incapable of\nrememb=\r\nering them. Hence keeping in mind our present circumstances and\nrequirement=\r\ns they have been classified into 14 precepts based on their\nsocial applicat=\r\nions. This number is certainly not that less that it is\ndifficult to includ=\r\ne all the streams of life within its realm and nor is\nthis number very high=\r\n which could confuse the common man=92s psyche. Like the\n14 jewels of Samud=\r\nra Manthan (churning of the ocean in Indian Mythology\ncalled Puranas) the e=\r\nternal principles of human religion/duty have been\nclassified as the follow=\r\ning 14 precepts:\n1) theism 2) spirituality 3) religiosity 4) progressivenes=\r\ns 5) self control\n6) unity 7) looking upon the world as one peaceful family=\r\n 8) socialism 9)\nsacredness 10) punctuality 11) integrity 12) discriminatio=\r\nn between right\nand wrong 13) attaining the spiritual goal 14) radiant skil=\r\nls. In this\nmanner when man imbibes these 14 jewels of ethics true religios=\r\nity will\nbloom in his psyche/soul. Human transformation and social progress=\r\n will be\nattained only when these are truly imbibed in great measure.\n\nNow =\r\nlet us study all these individually and in a systematic manner:\n\n1) THEISM:=\r\n The very spine of human ethics and values is faith in God=92s\nexistence. F=\r\naith in the fruits of ones deeds, ethics and imbibing discipline\nis possibl=\r\ne only when we are very sure of an omnipotent power controlling\nthis cosmos=\r\n. Faith that God does exist helps man refrain from sinning and in\nits place=\r\n inspires him to walk on the path of integrity. This is that golden\nfetter =\r\nwhich can induce man to imbibe greatness at all times. True socialism\nand a=\r\npt management of society can proliferate only when ethics and\ndiscipline ru=\r\nle the roost and that we harbor unshaken faith in them. When we\nlack this f=\r\naith unruliness and crime breed like deadly mosquitoes. This in\nturn not on=\r\nly mars the institution called a family but that tension and\nchaos enter ou=\r\nr society in a big way. Hence faith in the existence of a\nsubtle divine and=\r\n all powerful principle (God) helps ward off illegal and\ncriminal activitie=\r\ns in mankind=92s life.\n............ to be continued ................\n\nAutho=\r\nr : Pt shriram Sharma Acharyaji\n\n-- \nThank you and Have a Fulfilling Day\n\nV=\r\nenkat Koppaka\n\r\n--0015175ce170806faa046fd5b6b8\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;Dear ALL,&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Namaste.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;all&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;These are those very 4 legs of religious duties which help =\r\nboth individuals and world society to attain both material and spiritual bl=\r\niss.
