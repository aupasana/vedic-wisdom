Even if one does not think \nin those terms, it still happens. It is incorrect to say that one can \nrealize the highest truths without Kundalini awakened. A more accurate \nstatement would be that one can realize the highest truths without engaging \nin any specific practices geared at awakening or raising Kundalini.\n\nSome people following the so-called &quot;Kundalini yoga&quot; or other raja/hatha \nyoga paths specifically try to awaken Kundalini. However, such practices are \nnot at all needed for awakening Kundalini. People belonging to various \ntraditions and paths, not just limited to Hinduism, can experience Kundalini \nawakening, without knowing anything about the name or the symbolism. There \nare a lot of misconceptions about Kundalini.\n\n*        *        *\n\nKundalini is essentially the force of one&#39;s self-awareness. Awakened and \nraised kundalini implies a more refined and higher self-awareness.\n\nAt the lowest level, we bind our selves to specific bodies and our \nself-awareness is limited to a body, a name and other things associated with \nthe body and name. This experience of self as a body corresponds to \nKundalini sleeping at Mooladhara. At the highest level, we are the \nundifferentiated Self, known as Brahman, that is all-pervading. This \n&#39;experience&#39; of self corresponds to Kundalini at Sahasrara. As \nself-awareness goes from the former to the latter, it may traverse through \nmany stages in between. Correspondingly, many experiences are possible.\n\n*        *        *\n\nKundalini rises as high as it can when it awakens for the first time, like a \nspring suppressed for a long time. However, it comes down again and the \nprocess of rise from then onwards will be slower, Kundalini will work its \nway up while the nadis are continuously cleaned (i.e. undesirable \nconditioning of mind is cleaned). When Kundalini rises high at the time of \nawakening, it may encounter impurities in nadis and yet rise high through \nthe impurities. This may manifest physically as a powerful experience \nsimilar to heavy electricity flowing in the back.\n\nThere are thousands of nadis in the sookshma sareera. The exact path taken \nby Kundalini as it rises for the first time is not fixed. It may change from \nperson to person, based on the impurities in various nadis. The exact \n&quot;experience&quot; will vary depending on the path traversed and the final point \nreached by self-awareness (kundalini), before withdrawal.\n\nI actually know one person who had kundalini awakening, rise to Sahasrara \nand samadhi for 7 days, all happening at the same time. His nadis had \nalready been purified. Once kundalini awakened, he directly went into \nsamadhi, stayed there for 7 days and came back as a fully realized person. \nBut it is a much longer journey for most.\n\nSaying &quot;this is what happens in a Kundalini awakening&quot; is difficult. The \nexact experience changes from person to person, depending on the path \ntraversed the final point reached by Kundalini. However, I can say one thing \nconfidently: Once Kundalini truly awakens and rises, one will not have any \nconfusion about what happened. But, until kundalini awakening occurs, one \nmay confuse various other experiences (such as some movement of vayu in \nvarious nadis) for kundalini movement and wrongly think that kundalini is \nawakened.\n\n*        *        *\n\nSensation like ants or worms crawling along the spine or in the head are NOT \ndue to kundalini awakening or rise. That can be due to a little vaayu \nflowing in various nadis. This can be a premonitory sign (but not a \nguarantee) of kundalini awakening. Same thing can be said about the \nsensation of tilting  to one side (back or left or right) or the sensation \nof having completely fallen back (even though one is sitting normally in \nreality). There are several such premonitory signs.\n\n*        *        *\n\nAs a reference, I can narrate the experience of ONE person. He was \nmeditating with a Veda mantra everyday. His guru had told him a few months \nearlier that his time for Kundalini awakening had come. However, he had \nabsolutely no idea what kundalini was and was totally uninformed about \nnadis, chakras and kundalini. He did not engage in any specific raja/hatha \nyoga practices. All he did was to sit with his back erect and eyes closed \nand meditate with a veda mantra. In the weeks before kundalini awakening, he \nstarted experiencing various premonitory signs. He guru told him not to be \ndistracted by them and to keep the focus on the mantra and try to forget \neverything else. When mind starts dwelling on an experience, it gets stuck \nthere and cannot go higher.\n\nWhen he was meditating oneday, his mind was perfectly and intensely focused \non the mantra and other thoughts ceased momentarily. Suddenly he became \naware of his body. It felt like there was a really tremendous explosion at \nthe base of his spine. Then it felt like a huge amount of electric current \nwas going up his spine from the base. Then it felt like he was not a body \nbut a small point. Then it felt like he was going up like a rocket at a \ntremendous speed. Then it felt like there was a tremendously bright white \nlight and there was nothing else. It felt like he was not a small point in \nthat light, but he was the light itself. There was an undescribable sense of \npeace and happiness. Suddenly, from nowhere, a thought came &quot;what is this? \nWhat happened to my body? I have responsibilities still.&quot; Then he became \naware of himself as a body sitting in pooja room. When he left pooja room \nand went out, he felt great love for everyone and happiness. For example, a \nserial was coming on TV and characters in the serial that he normally \ndisliked for their shallow personalities suddenly felt like real people and \nhe had great love and compassion for those TV serial characters (and other \nreal people too). That state of love and compassion lasted a while and then \nhe was normal.\n\nThis short experience was only the beginning of a journey. He experienced \nmany things later on. These experiences were different from each other. As I \nsaid earlier, the experience varies based on the path traversed and the \npoint reached by the self-awareness (kundalini). On various occasions, \nkundalini rose and he saw several sights and several beings within and heard \nseveral sounds, including veda mantras and beejaaksharas, again within.\n\nHe realized the transientness of a lot that we cling on to and the existence \nof something far higher and more permanent.\n\nAll this slowly started to change his attitude. His senses turned inwards \nand he critically started to analyze his own thoughts and motives and worked \non correcting his attitude. The impact of what was happening around him, \nwhat others did and said started to make lesser and lesser impact on him. \nLuckily, he had a guru who put things in perspective and said that kundalini \nawakening was just a beginning and the real work was ahead. Depending on \none&#39;s readiness, that real work can take many many years or even lives.\n\n*        *        *\n\nKundalini awakening is only a beginning. It is not an end. Even the rise of \nkundalini to a chakra is not an end. In fact, a big percentage of people \nwith awakened kundalini end up getting stuck at mooladhara itself. Very few \nmake it to the next chakra or the one after, but end up getting stuck there. \nVery very few make it to higher chakras. And a very small minority actually \nrealise self.\n\nComplete overcoming of ego and sthita prajnataa described by Sri Krishna in \nBhagavadGita is the only real end goal of sadhana, whether you are into raja \nyoga or karma yoga or bhakti yoga or jnaana yoga. Thinking of a mystical \nexperience can only distract one from this goal. I urge sadhakas, especially \nthose who respect my advice, to forget about kundalini and chakras and just \nkeep doing homam and japam (or whatever path they have chosen), keep \npurifying themselves with sadhana, keep working on their attitude and \nthought process and keep improving self-control. When (or as) mind becomes \npurified and one overcomes ego, whatever needs to happen with kundalini WILL \nhappen automatically. Thinking of things in terms of kundalini and mystical \nexperiences is a big deterrent rather than a boost, in one&#39;s spiritual \nsadhana. Instead of trying to manipulate kundalini, try to manipulate the \nway your mind works and perfect your self-control. Kundalini will \nautomatically follow. One will do well to remember these words.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, March 08, 2009 3:30 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Urdhwa-Retas\n\n\nNamaste,\n\nRelevant to this on going subject, i remember reading autobiography of Shri \nYogeshwarji (Prakah na Panthe) in which he had mentioned that Kundalini \nAwakening is not mandatory for realization.

When one attains a perfect focus on a \n&gt; &gt; mantra and distracting thoughts cease, praana moves downward from \n&gt; &gt; lungs/stomach and apaana moves upward. After praana and apaana combine, \n&gt; &gt; they can move upward at a rapid speed.\n&gt; &gt; �\n&gt; &gt; When praana and apaana combine for the first time, it may feel like an \n&gt; &gt; explosion within one. As praana moves up, it will feel like one is freed \n&gt; &gt; from the body and one does not exist. This is similar to death, except \n&gt; &gt; that there is fear and confusion at death and one may feel a kind of \n&gt; &gt; bliss when this happens during meditation. However, if one&#39;s focus on \n&gt; &gt; mantra relaxes and one become &quot;aware of&quot; the experience and starts \n&gt; &gt; analyzing it with the rational mind, there is a chance of one becoming \n&gt; &gt; worried and confused. So one should sustain the state where there is \n&gt; &gt; full focus on mantra and no other distractions, for as long as possible.\n&gt; &gt; �\n&gt; &gt; These things happen automatically without thinking about them and \n&gt; &gt; engaging in any specific practicies. In fact, thinking about them, \n&gt; &gt; desiring them and doing specific practices may become an obstacle and \n&gt; &gt; delay things. If you surrender to a deity and do a mantra with a high \n&gt; &gt; level of focus, that is enough. Do NOT run after any experience and \n&gt; &gt; think of an experience as an end result. The focus should be mantra and \n&gt; &gt; mantra alone.\n&gt; &gt; �\n&gt; &gt; Even when an experience occurs, I tell people to not be tied to it and \n&gt; &gt; not think too much about it.\n&gt; &gt; �\n&gt; &gt; Suchaka dream is a vision of something that is going to happen.\n&gt; &gt; �\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; From: rajarshi nandy\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, March 03, 2009 5:17 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: On Remedial Measures Difference (Re: \n&gt; &gt; Resolving Points)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste\n&gt; &gt; �\n&gt; &gt; One feels a strange coolness on the skin and on the eyes.\n&gt; &gt; A few repititions of the mantra bring about a situation where the deity \n&gt; &gt; possesses the sadhaka and the sadhaka&#39;s prana goes upward very \n&gt; &gt; quickly( Urdhwa Retas),\n&gt; &gt; During all meditation the sadhaka sees the feet or clothes or hands or \n&gt; &gt; face, etc of the deity sitting beside him along with minute details of \n&gt; &gt; the room (even though the sadhak&#39;s eyes are closed).\n&gt; &gt; The sadhak typically becomes dreamless except for suchaka dreams.\n&gt; &gt; The whole day the sadhaka behaves like a love lorn person.

Rao\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, March 02, 2009 8:09 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: On Remedial Measures Difference (Re: Resolving Points)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; �\n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; �\n&gt; &gt; When the sadhaka effaces his own personality such that the deity of the \n&gt; &gt; mantra comes and occupies him, then at that stage there is\n&gt; &gt; no real difference between the sadhaka and the Deity(even if the deity \n&gt; &gt; is with the sadhaka all day I would say that there is no real \n&gt; &gt; difference).\n&gt; &gt; The difference that one feels is as follows:\n&gt; &gt; One feels a strange coolness on the skin and on the eyes.\n&gt; &gt; A few repititions of the mantra bring about a situation where the deity \n&gt; &gt; possesses the sadhaka and the sadhaka&#39;s prana goes upward very \n&gt; &gt; quickly( Urdhwa Retas),\n&gt; &gt; During all meditation the sadhaka sees the feet or clothes or hands or \n&gt; &gt; face, etc of the deity sitting beside him along with minute details of \n&gt; &gt; the room (even though the sadhak&#39;s eyes are closed).\n&gt; &gt; The sadhak typically becomes dreamless except for suchaka dreams.\n&gt; &gt; The whole day the sadhaka behaves like a love lorn person. How can i \n&gt; &gt; again experience the Beloved.\n&gt; &gt; That then is the experience of mantra when it is done correctly.\n&gt; &gt; When the sadhak&#39;s personality is effaced such that the deity&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; personality sits there then the sadhak experiences himself as that \n&gt; &gt; Deity(Devata) .\n&gt; &gt; There then arises no difference in the sadhak or the deity commanding a \n&gt; &gt; certain thing to happen( be it what appears to be good or be it that \n&gt; &gt; which appears to be bad) . The deity&#39;s personality is crucial. Ugra \n&gt; &gt; devatas make the person care almost for nothing himself, so self \n&gt; &gt; identification is minimised and the person&#39;s spiritual evolution \n&gt; &gt; continues.\n&gt; &gt; Remember, there is� very little� according to me which is black magic. \n&gt; &gt; It is all a use of Shakti. If your Shakti and deity is a higher shakti \n&gt; &gt; such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your power \n&gt; &gt; will be that of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana). After the death \n&gt; &gt; of the body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the deity or if he was \n&gt; &gt; originally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm reserved for these \n&gt; &gt; beings.\n&gt; &gt; Attacking such a sadhak brings the full bearing of karma onto the heads \n&gt; &gt; of the attackers and some people may realise this to their detriment( \n&gt; &gt; Patan comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Patan with his \n&gt; &gt; Shakti causing an earthquake). Some people may even equate this with \n&gt; &gt; black magic. Here there is only action and reaction.(Bit like you attack \n&gt; &gt; a normal person, and you will get a result of this from that same Atma \n&gt; &gt; whom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack \n&gt; &gt; somebody who is identifying with the universe and has very few karmas \n&gt; &gt; left, then the Universe itself attacks you, because your attack is not \n&gt; &gt; on the sadhaka, but on his identification, ie God or the universe).\n&gt; &gt; If people persist in using the Shakti possesed by a small Pisacha, \n&gt; &gt; Bhuta, then there is only a little Shakti which can be used, moreover� \n&gt; &gt; then their minds and intellects will not be free of identification with \n&gt; &gt; the body and so their actions are those which are generally termed as \n&gt; &gt; black magic. These people usually join the same spirits which they have \n&gt; &gt; been using after death, this is not an enjoyable experience.\n&gt; &gt; Imagine if somebody is worshipping Chandika for a few lifetimes, then \n&gt; &gt; even in this birth he or she is drawn to that deity and such a sadhak \n&gt; &gt; may acheive after a few repitions of a mantra(because of his previous \n&gt; &gt; effort).\n&gt; &gt; On the other hand somebody doing this mantra only in this lifetime may \n&gt; &gt; feel that the 64 things which bind every mantra are crucial and may not \n&gt; &gt; acheive in this lifetime.\n&gt; &gt; According to me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let me \n&gt; &gt; suggest an easy sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; If one is so inclined, then starting on some good day, do 1000 \n&gt; &gt; reititions of the Savitri(some� call this the� Gayatri, but the real \n&gt; &gt; Gayatri is hidden) every day, main constraints\n&gt; &gt; Same time every day.\n&gt; &gt; Same place.\n&gt; &gt; Same materials.\n&gt; &gt; Same direction.\n&gt; &gt; As little movement as one can.\n&gt; &gt; Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.\n&gt; &gt; Complete restraint on sex(from the mind and the body, not just the \n&gt; &gt; body), reduce food intake, grow a beard.\n&gt; &gt; Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels are empty \n&gt; &gt; before you start.\n&gt; &gt; Continue this for 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 times.\n&gt; &gt; See the difference in your personality before and after.\n&gt; &gt; Long and short , what is important is that life may be short, so do some \n&gt; &gt; sadhana, and persist with that sadhana for as long as is physically \n&gt; &gt; possible.\n&gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies some of the concepts which were being discussed.\n&gt; &gt; �\n&gt; &gt; Kind Love and Regards\n&gt; &gt; manish\n&gt; &gt; You may post this on the list as a clarification from me if you feel \n&gt; &gt; that this is suitable.\n\n\n"}}
