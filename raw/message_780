Supressing desire cann=\r\not be termed as a brahmacharya..right?\n&gt; \n&gt; The connection between&#39;Desire &=\r\n Supression&#39; needs to be understood \n&gt; properly, once and for ever so as to=\r\n understand Control & \n&gt; Annihilation/overcome/rising above\n&gt; \n&gt; Let us tak=\r\ne a practical case of day to day life of a common person. \n&gt; Take an Indivi=\r\ndual &#39;Z&#39; has a desire for copulation with his wife. \nHe \n&gt; *Satisfies* his =\r\ndesire one day and becomes very satsfied with it. \n&gt; now THAT perticular de=\r\nsire seems to be gone. few days passes on and \n&gt; mr. Z finds that the same =\r\nDesire has Risen again, he again satsfies \n&gt; the same with the same action.=\r\n these cycle keeps going on & on for \n&gt; many years. Mr. Z feels like most i=\r\nn the world that this desire to \n&gt; have sexual relationship is &#39;Natural&#39;.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Now let&#39;s analysie the above case. Though mr.Z satsfies the want of \n&gt; =\r\ncopulation, it comes back again & again. it means that the desire \n&gt; has ne=\r\nver been satsfied even by giving it FOOD Again & again.\n&gt; ***\n&gt; Our spiritu=\r\nal giants equvivocally say that The Energy which is lost \n&gt; during copulati=\r\non is the BEST Energy available in a person which if \n&gt; restrained, control=\r\nled and preserved, can easly become OJAS and can \n&gt; help immensly in the pa=\r\nth of Spiritual journey.\n&gt; ***\n&gt; consider that our Mr. Z some how got to re=\r\nad the above paragraph \nand \n&gt; started seriously thinking about it. He tell=\r\ns himself that he would \n&gt; refrain from intercourse for 3 months. The earli=\r\ner frequency was \n2/3 \n&gt; days, now he suddenly finds that desire has comple=\r\ntely overtaken \n&gt; him. after 15 days, he finds that Desire has gone in to h=\r\nis every \n&gt; pour and every thought and he gives up and succumbs to that \ngi=\r\ngantic \n&gt; force of Kaam Vaasana. This may be called suppression initially \n=\r\n&gt; which failed the effort. The person again analyses what went wrong \n&gt; and=\r\n again tries to do the same and again fails. he keeps on trying \n&gt; and keep=\r\ns on failing. during this battles, he is also exploring and \n&gt; gathering kn=\r\nowledge of experienced people and knowledge from \n&gt; spiritual books. he und=\r\nerstands that if he needs to win the Final \n&gt; WAR with this Very Formidable=\r\n enemy, he needs to do lot of things \n&gt; simultaneously and he then resorts =\r\nto the help from many quarters. \n&gt; He starts taking cold water bath, starts=\r\n reading spiritual books, \n&gt; stops reading film magazine, stops watching Fi=\r\nlms and TV Shows, \n&gt; Reduces eating Onion and garlic, starts doing Yoga Aas=\r\nan, \nMeditation \n&gt; and so on and so forth. taking the aids thus he keeps on=\r\n batteling \n&gt; with the *Natural Desire* and still keeps on loosing. but the=\r\n good \n&gt; news is that his days of batteling before loosing has increased. \n=\r\n&gt; started from 10 days, he has now reached the struggeling capacity \nof \n&gt; =\r\n90 days. (WE ARE ASSUMING HERE THAT HIS WIFE IS FULLY COOPERATIVE \nOF \n&gt; HI=\r\nS THEATRICS). He is still unhappy about his loosing, although he \n&gt; is able=\r\n to keep-up the Physical brahmacharya for 3 months. some how \n&gt; he realises=\r\n that God&#39;s grace is the most important thing especially \n&gt; for this pertic=\r\nular matter and he now starts Praying to his \n&gt; favourite Deity every day. =\r\nhe cries and cries and requests the God \n&gt; to save him from this loss. he k=\r\neeps on trying every thing \npossible, \n&gt; keeps on praying sincerely and sev=\r\nerly, keeps on doing various \n&gt; spiritual sadhanas but still keeps on loosi=\r\nng at as well. over a \n&gt; period of some 8/10 years, the desired change is v=\r\nisible. he has \n&gt; conquered his desire. Now Sexual Desire which was his *Na=\r\ntural* for \n&gt; him has been replaced by Brahmacharya.\n&gt; \n&gt; &#39;Supression&#39; when=\r\n combined with Thoughtful Suspension, equipped \nwith \n&gt; every possible prep=\r\naration and will power to try untiringly again & \n&gt; again finally results i=\r\nn to annihilation.\n&gt; \n&gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; 2.

Set a \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rule for 20 days or 40 days or=\r\n 108 days or some period like \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; maintai=\r\nn physical brahmacharya. Don&#39;t worry if thoughts come.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Feeling of guilt is a weight and it does not help in \n&gt; overcoming \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the basic \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problem. Don&#39;t be over-burdened by it.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, what i read in AGHORA was the importa=\r\nnt thing is \n&gt; not\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suppress desires but remove them from the=\r\n root\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; True, suppressing desire will make the des=\r\nire come back \nlater. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But, if one \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; keeps fulfillin=\r\ng desires, they never end!!  This is the \nnature \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; d=\r\nesire. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whether one desires money or knowledge (of anything ot=\r\nher \nthan \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Self) or \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physical pleasures, the desire=\r\n will never end no matter how \n&gt; much \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; one gets.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Removing desire from the root often requires suppressing the \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; desire \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporarily. But the thing to remember from =\r\nthe Aghora book \nis \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that just \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suppressing desire =\r\nis not sufficient. Practice suppressing \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; desires, but do \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; remember that the final goal is to uproot it fully and keep \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; working on it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The only reason for which i=\r\n keep trying for brahamcharya is \n&gt; if\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vimalananda took such=\r\n a long time probasbly i can also do \n&gt; it , \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; if\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no=\r\nt in 6 years at least in 10-12 years\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That is the=\r\n right spirit!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritual progress involves a lot=\r\n of things and brahmacharya \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; one thing. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The =\r\nmost fundamental thing is to overcome ego and not become \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; attach=\r\ned to \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; things. Developing detachment to one&#39;s actions and \npos=\r\nsessions \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; developing a sense of surrender is the=\r\n most fundamental thing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are several thing=\r\ns in spiritual progress. They all come \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; together! One \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; person may develop detachment to actions and possessions and \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; brahmacharya \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may become easy as a result. One person may ac=\r\nhieve \n&gt; brahmacharya \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; first and \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; detachment may be=\r\ncome easy as a result and come later. \nVarious \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; signs of \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual progress come almost together, but the exact order \n&gt; can =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; change from \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person to person. Thus, do not be dis=\r\nappointed by your \n&gt; inability \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to get \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something. =\r\nIt may be possible to work it out from another \n&gt; angle!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- ---------\n&gt;  -\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ \n&gt; homam\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAst rologer.o=\r\nrg/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedi=\r\nc- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.=\r\ncomcast. \n&gt; net\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAst \n&gt; rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http=\r\n://www.SriJagan \n&gt; nath.org\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- ---------\n&gt;  -\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --=\r\n--- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste sir\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; i know you are lot busy but since i couldn;t ask this \nquestion \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; on a\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; public forum as it may probably offend others.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; If you have time ,if you could please reply.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; I was thinking this for many days\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that as mentioned in rec=\r\nent thread on brahamcharya,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it was important to maintain braha=\r\nmcharya but i wanted to ask \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; even vimalananda ha=\r\nd to work for 6 years for overcoming lust \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; though\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he =\r\nhad his deity with him from the very early in life.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; how can normal college going people like me who don&#39;t even \n&gt; have a\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deity obtain this goal.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though i try to maintain ph=\r\nysical brahamcharya for few months \n&gt; but\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; after that i am not =\r\nable to hold it ,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and even if i maintain some physical chastit=\r\ny it refuses to \ngo \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; out\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of mind\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, what i read in AGHORA was the important thing is not\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suppress desires but remove them from the root\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; So, how can i finish it completely from my mind\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though =\r\ni have read Swami Sivananda&#39;s book on Practice of \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Brahamcharya\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but i don&#39;t think i have made any spiritual progress in \n&gt; mai=\r\nntaing\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Brahamcharya\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and sometimes i=\r\nt makes me guilt ridden.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The only reason for whi=\r\nch i keep trying for brahamcharya is if\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vimalananda took such =\r\na long time probasbly i can also do \nit , \n&gt; if\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not in 6 years=\r\n at least in 10-12 years\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you can also reply on V=\r\nEDIC WISDOM group but if you can \nremove \n&gt; my\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; identity from t=\r\nhis that would be appreciable\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if what i worte of=\r\nfended you please delete this mail\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regards\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;deleted&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;       \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;     \n&gt; &gt;     \n&gt; &gt; \t\n&gt; &gt; \t \n&gt; &gt; \t\n&gt; &gt; \t\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \t\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \t\n&gt; &gt; \t\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;       Connect with fri=\r\nends all over the world.
