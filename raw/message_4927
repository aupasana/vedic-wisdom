This is a common notion that several priests have. It is nice and sweet of them to be concerned about prodding the deities. But let me pose it differently. Suppose a guest in your house is stuck under a sofa and a chair and suffocated. Do you leave him alone or do you move the sofa and chair so that he can move out?\n \nSome minimal movement of contents using tongs to ensure better supply of air around the materials so that Fire can devour all offerings is perfectly acceptable. Without it, Fire may find it difficult to consume all.\n \n2. Several shlokas from Saptashati itself or Saptashloki or Kavacha or Argala are used. Though it is not given anywhere, I intuitively feel that &quot;sreeraama raama raameti&quot; shloka will be good. Another idea is using &quot;om aim&quot; for first part, &quot;om hreem&quot; for the middle part and &quot;om kleem&quot; for the final part. Or you can use &quot;om aim hreem kleem&quot; for all.\n \n3. People repeat the full shloka 3 times instead, instead of breaking at each namastasyai.\n \n4. If you use a shloka, once between each two shlokas is enough. If you use beejas, use them like this:\n \nExample: om aim &lt;shloka 1&gt; aim om, om aim &lt;shloka 2&gt; aim om and so on.\n \n5. These differences suggest that the guidelines are arbitrary. I do not offer specific substances for each chapter, but I offer specific substances for a few specific shlokas. For example, &quot;madhu yaavat pibaamyaham&quot; comes in the 3rd chapter and I offer jaggery. Some offer honey. For &quot;sarva maMgaLa maaMgaLye&quot; in the 11th chapter, I offer dry turmeric pieces that are normally used in maMgaLya. For &quot;daaDimI kusumopamaaH&quot; in 11th chapter, I offer pomegranate seeds. Like that, some specific substances based on the meanings of verses are possible.\n \nBut, my general guideline is to not worry about too many technicalities.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- SumeetK &lt;vedichoroscope@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Narasimhaji and other Gurujan,\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.  During the Homam, it is ok to stir the contents of the Homa Kunda to\n&gt; get better combustion of ingredients and distribution of fire or that\n&gt; should only be done at the end of the homam?  Reason I am asking this\n&gt; question is that recently I was talking to a priest and he mentioned\n&gt; that you are inviting all these devatas into the Homam Agni so why do\n&gt; you keep disturbing them by prodding a tong into the fire on a regular\n&gt; basis in the middle of the homam?  Your thoughts please\n&gt; \n&gt; 2.  What are some of the recommended  Samputs that can be added for\n&gt; Chandi Homam?  I sometimes add the navarana mantra after each shloka of\n&gt; the Chandi during Homam as Samput as I find that makes the Homam more\n&gt; powerful but have been told that other Samputs can be taken also such as\n&gt; &quot;namo devyai mahadevyai...&quot; and &quot;sarva-mangal maangalyai...&quot; after each\n&gt; shloka\n&gt; \n&gt; 3.  If one is taking a Samput in the Chandi Homam, then in Chapter 5,\n&gt; should the Samput be taken after each &quot;namastasyai&quot;?  Example do we have\n&gt; to go &quot;ya devi sarvabhuteshu buddhirupena samsthita, namastasyai (swaaha\n&gt; + samput and swaaha), namastasyai (swaaha + samput and swaaha),\n&gt; namastasyai namo namah (swaaha + samput and swaaha) or just go with the\n&gt; regular swaaha and then one samput at the end followed by swaaha?\n&gt; \n&gt; 4.  While taking a Samput some people take the samput twice for each\n&gt; shloka.  Is that the recommended norm?\n&gt; \n&gt; 5.  Do you have some guidance on offering specific ingredients for each\n&gt; chapter of the Chandi?  There are several books which offer guidance for\n&gt; specific offerings during the 13 chapters but they are not consistent. \n&gt; I realize that everything belongs to her so why get too fancy but\n&gt; sometimes it is nice to get into the play and offer different things out\n&gt; of love.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; Sumeet\n\n\n"}}
