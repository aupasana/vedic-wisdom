It is just, the *head* comes in questioning when some \nskeptics q=\r\nuestion about the very existence of Mahabhaarat or \nRaamaayan. some time it=\r\n is a sincere query also. some time you think \nyourself also about it.\n\n\nye=\r\ns it is &#39;Iti Haas&#39;. &#39;it Happened&#39; and not epic.\n\nin case of mahatma Gandhi,=\r\n I just gave opinion of him but i don&#39;t \nendorse his view in this matter.\n\n=\r\nSu-Yodhan and Su Shaasan - its a revealation for me.i never new \nthis. Than=\r\nks but can you give me reference about that and who \nchanged the names? - t=\r\nhis will be very good point which has bothered \nme.\n\nRegarding, prooving th=\r\ne Mahaabhaarat events with astronomical \ncombination, can hardly be taken a=\r\ns proof because while writing his \ncreation, Maharshi Vyaasa would have tak=\r\nen combination of those \ntimes. - this is just another argument by Logical =\r\nview.\n\nSwami Vivekananda, in his work &#39;Shri Krishna & Bhagvad Gita&#39; \nmentio=\r\nns That whether Shri Kishna was a reality or Not, gita&#39;s \nmessage is great.=\r\n it gives eternal knowledge.\n\nI&#39;ve made argument with some people in the pa=\r\nst that &quot;if modern \nHistory has not recorded the world events does not mean=\r\n that the \nexistance of human beings was not there on the earth. in other w=\r\nords \nmodern history can never be the only &#39;Pramaan&#39; for judging reality \no=\r\nf ancient events and personalities.  \n\nFinally it seems, that it might rema=\r\nin, matter of our heart and \nbeliefs.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n--- In vedic-w=\r\nisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vvootla&quot; &lt;vvootla@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Utpal ji,=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramayana and Mahabharata are collectively referred as itihAsa in \nour=\r\n\n&gt; tradition. The word itihAsa translates literally to &quot;so it \nhappened&quot;.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Also, please refer to the numerous close attempts at astronomically\n&gt; d=\r\nating the Mahabharata by Shri Narahari Achar\n&gt; \n&lt;http://sarasvati96.googlep=\r\nages.com/reclaimingthechronologyofbharatam\n%3A&#92;\n&gt; narahariachar%28july2006%=\r\n29&gt;  , Shri P V Vartak\n&gt; \n&lt;http://www.hindunet.org/hindu_history/ancient/ma=\r\nhabharat/mahab_varta\nk.h&#92;\n&gt; tml&gt;   etc. that confirms the time period accor=\r\nding to internal\n&gt; references within the epic.\n&gt; \n&gt; And my brief responses =\r\nto your questions are as follows\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Mahatma Gandhi, the Great Soul he =\r\nindeed was, wasn&#39;t a scholar \nin\n&gt; Indic traditions and studies (religious,=\r\n historical etc). He had \nother\n&gt; nobler tasks to concentrate his energies =\r\non. So we need not rely \non his\n&gt; judgement/opinions on these matters\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n2) The original names were &#39;suyOdhan, sushAsan&#39; etc. The &#39;du&#39; \nprefix was\n&gt;=\r\n substituted after the fact to indicate the negative side of ethics \nand\n&gt; =\r\nmorality these people were.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) This looks just an opinion with no subs=\r\ntantiation and hence I&#39;ll\n&gt; leave this.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) Shri Raman&#39;s reasoning is v=\r\nalid but not sufficient (if that is \nall he\n&gt; stated and not any more)\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n 5) Very true. By extendsion and generalization, if vyAsa was a con\n&gt; artis=\r\nt, what does he have to benefit from painting a character as \nGod?\n&gt; \n&gt; 6) =\r\nI don&#39;t think there is any dispute about whether Rama or \nKrishna were\n&gt; bo=\r\nrn. True that there are disputes on their era, divinity etc. but \nI did\n&gt; n=\r\not come across any disputes about their very existence many \nmillenia\n&gt; ago=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; To establish any Truth conclusively, it is not possible by relying \n=\r\non\n&gt; others but by genuinely embarking on the search ourselves and \nemployi=\r\nng\n&gt; all our faculties towards that. Otherwise, it just remains our\n&gt; preju=\r\ndiced choice of which scholar&#39;s opinion to value over other.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n=\r\n&gt; -Prasad\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedi=\r\nc_pathak@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha Garu & Members,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There is a lo=\r\nng pending question with me and that is Historical\n&gt; &gt; reality or otherwise=\r\n of our many revered personalities/events.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Take for instance, &#39;Maha=\r\nbhaarat&#39; & &#39;Shri Krishna&#39;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I would try to give some view points gat=\r\nhered from all these \nyears\n&gt; &gt; from various sources and my own thinking as=\r\n well-\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1) Mahatma Gandhi didn&#39;t belive that Mahabhaarat was a reali=\r\nty.he\n&gt; &gt; thought that it was &#39;epic&#39;-creation of a poet. he seems to be \nun=\r\nable\n&gt; &gt; to belive logically the creation of 100 sons etc...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2) How=\r\n can parents name their children \nas &#39;DURYodhan&#39;, &#39;Du:Shasan&#39;\n&gt; &gt; etc.. i a=\r\nm not sure about the meaning of the names but it implies\n&gt; &gt; something perv=\r\nerted. knwoledgable person in sanskrit can shed \nsome\n&gt; &gt; light on this.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; 3) Mahabhaarat was a Grand Poem created by super-intelligent \nauthor,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Maharshi Vyaas and hence Gita was also his own creation and \nkrsihna\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; was just a &#39;imaginary&#39; central character of his grand work.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; !...=\r\n..!.....!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1) Dr. Raman, in Notable Horoscopes has strongly written =\r\nthat \nShri\n&gt; &gt; Krishna was a historically reality. His reasoning was that a=\r\nn\n&gt; &gt; *Imaginery creation* of some poet can never Inspire & attract\n&gt; &gt; mil=\r\nlions of people for thousans of years.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2) If Maharshi Vyaas has wri=\r\ntten imaginery story of Mahabhaarat \nto\n&gt; &gt; satisfy his poetic genious then=\r\n how come he himself features in \nthe\n&gt; &gt; story? if let&#39;s consider even tha=\r\nt as a possibility but then WHY\n&gt; &gt; he&#39;ll write another book just on Shri K=\r\nrishna i.e. Bhaagavata. \nwhy\n&gt; &gt; he&#39;ll himself Worship his own &#39;Kaalpanik P=\r\naatra&#39;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 3) If Shri Krishna was never born, then how come so many Sa=\r\nints \nof\n&gt; &gt; yesteryears, saw his form.\n&gt; &gt; One can argue that becuase of t=\r\nheir intense worship of that\n&gt; &gt; perticular Form, they could see the same f=\r\norm of the supreme\n&gt; &gt; reality...the supreme power can take any form for th=\r\ne Bhakta.\n&gt; &gt; The solid counter argument is that, Paramhamsa Yogananda and\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Maharshi Aurobindo, it seems, never were a Devotee of that form \nof\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Shri Krishna, then how come in their case, without devotion & \ndesire\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthey got to see the form of Shri Krushna?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; !....!....!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Any t=\r\nhoughts about this?
