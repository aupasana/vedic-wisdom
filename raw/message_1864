The meditation too\n&gt; &gt; happened in a more =\r\nfocused and better way.\n&gt; \n&gt; There may be a couple of factors behind this.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; The energy of some deities is more active during night than the day. A=\r\nfter \n&gt; all, night is symbolic of the primordial state of the universe. Dei=\r\nties \n&gt; personifying the energies and state of the universe in the initial =\r\n\n&gt; primordial stages are easier to identify with during the night. Thus, if=\r\n you \n&gt; do homam for Mahaakaala, Kaali, Bhairava etc, night time is more ap=\r\nt.\n&gt; \n&gt; More importantly, some people doing homam in the morning before goi=\r\nng to \n&gt; work feel some kind of time pressure in the mind (atleast sub-cons=\r\nciously). \n&gt; When you know that you have to finish and go to work in anothe=\r\nr 30 min or \n&gt; hour or whatever, that pressure may be at the back of the mi=\r\nnd. Whereas if \n&gt; one does at the end of the day, when there is no pressure=\r\n of any kind, the \n&gt; mind may be more relaxed and one may be able to focus =\r\nbetter.\n&gt; \n&gt; In any case, I suggest not worrying about all these things and=\r\n starting the \n&gt; practice with some time or the other. If morning is conven=\r\nient, do in the \n&gt; morning. If evening is convenient, do in the evening. If=\r\n night is \n&gt; convenient, do in the night. Pick a time and do it at that tim=\r\ne everyday or \n&gt; every week or at whatever frequency you have chosen. After=\r\n you do it for a \n&gt; while, then you may think of experimenting with a diffe=\r\nrent time and see \n&gt; which time is working better. In the beginning, it pay=\r\ns to just get started \n&gt; with some time or the other.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I also feel so=\r\nme sort of activity/squeeze ai the solar\n&gt; &gt; plexus....sort of ,what one fe=\r\nels at the heart when\n&gt; &gt; one sees an emotional movie.Why is this?\n&gt; \n&gt; Whe=\r\nn one focuses mind on a mantra, one MAY feel activity in various parts of \n=\r\n&gt; the body, like a tingling sensation or pressure or heat or coldness or \n&gt;=\r\n crawling of ants etc. Such activity may be felt in various parts of the \n&gt;=\r\n body, like the crown of the head or forehead or throat or heart or solar \n=\r\n&gt; plexus etc. It merely shows the movement of praana vaayu in various chakr=\r\nas \n&gt; and nadis that are in need of praana (life force). For example, Manip=\r\noora \n&gt; chakra in the solar plexus area is the seat of fire element, which =\r\nis the \n&gt; center of one&#39;s sense of control and pride. Any personality trait=\r\ns related \n&gt; to short temper, pride, anger etc will be linked to some defic=\r\niencies in the \n&gt; Manipoora chakra. When one is able to focus in meditation=\r\n well, some praana \n&gt; may be moving in the Manipoora chakra area and trying=\r\n to improve the \n&gt; deficiency.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, if a considerable amount of =\r\npraana moves in particular nadis, one \n&gt; may even get a sensation of moving=\r\n up ot tilting to a side or back etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; But the important thing is to ig=\r\nnore all these and not be distracted by any \n&gt; of these sensations. Awarene=\r\nss and analysis of the sensation distracts the \n&gt; mind from its focus on th=\r\ne mantra. As praana moves everywhere and clears all \n&gt; deficiencies, one be=\r\ncomes ready for realization.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am at presnt doing the bare minimum h=\r\noma vidhi.Can i\n&gt; &gt; meditate even after the fire has gone out.I use ghee, s=\r\no it\n&gt; &gt; does not last very long after the aahutis are done.And i\n&gt; &gt; would=\r\n like to stay &#39;There&#39; more.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, you can meditate even after the fire =\r\ngoes off. Homam burns some \n&gt; internal impurities and internal purity is at=\r\n a maximum (local maximum) \n&gt; immediately following homam. Just sit and med=\r\nitate as long as you can. After \n&gt; that, as the day progresses and we start=\r\n thinking of various things, newer \n&gt; impurities may accumulate again. So m=\r\neditating immediately after homam is \n&gt; helpful to maximize the effect.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrolog=\r\ner.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/t=\r\narpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jy=\r\notish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish soft=\r\nware (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC)=\r\n website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -----------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From:=\r\n &quot;sunita_vt&quot; &lt;sunita_vt@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: M=\r\nonday, May 25, 2009 7:42 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Can I perform hom=\r\nam any time?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; I too do havan in the evening,but before su=\r\nnset.I do it around 6 pm.\n&gt; It always feels great.\n&gt; I also feel some sort =\r\nof activity/squeeze ai the solar plexus....sort of \n&gt; ,what one feels at th=\r\ne heart when one sees an emotional movie.Why is this?\n&gt; I am at presnt doin=\r\ng the bare minimum homa vidhi.Can i meditate even after \n&gt; the fire has gon=\r\ne out.I use ghee, so it does not last very long after the \n&gt; aahutis are do=\r\nne.And i would like to stay &#39;There&#39; more.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Sunita.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- =\r\nIn vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Namaste\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have a little experience to share in this regard.
