I got the book last year, but i sti=\r\nll haven&#39;t started reading.\nThe reason being i&#39;ve come across all your post=\r\ns and people responding to your posts, i.e whether a person who has not bee=\r\nn initiated could read or should not read. I&#39;m not able to conclude, even n=\r\now i&#39;m reading the post and text by Dr. Sathya Prakash Choudhary, but still=\r\n unable to conclude.\n\n\nI&#39;ve read that people should be very careful while r=\r\neading Durga Sapthashati, i don&#39;t know to what extent and what could be the=\r\n consequences\nI do read Aditya Hrudayam, Srisuktham, Vishnu Sahasranamam, L=\r\nalitha Sahasranamam, Lalitha Trishati. I don&#39;t know how i started reading, =\r\nno body guided me or initiated me how to read but i read it easily, wheneve=\r\nr i do prayer i ask for for well being of all the people i know, sometimes =\r\njust blessings and sometimes i don&#39;t even ask anything.\n\n\nI try to follow r=\r\neading for one deity=C2=A0continuously=C2=A0for N number of days, then star=\r\nt reading for other deities and follow the same rule.\nAbout me: I&#39;m a bache=\r\nlor aged about 28\n\nMy questions\n1.
