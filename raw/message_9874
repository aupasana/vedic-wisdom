Instead of explicitly admitting a body (whet=\r\nher it is subtle or gross) that survives upon death, haven&#39;t you just creat=\r\ned an \nimplicit body bound to your concept of a soul?&gt;&gt;\n\nI am not sure that=\r\n I understood your question correctly. \n\n\nKarma &quot;attaches&quot; itself by settin=\r\ng certain preconditions/circumstances based on the desires of the soul and =\r\nlessons the egosense must learn for manifesting the soul. This process is t=\r\naken care of by Nature&#39;s laws. These two - desire and need - are slightly d=\r\nifferent. At the moment of death the soul has a specific ability to interna=\r\nlize and project what it needs/wants to experience in the next birth. That =\r\ngets set firmly. That counts as a desire of the soul. And the basic reactio=\r\nn process of actions performed is the need or the consequence to be faced i=\r\nn order that the egosense can learn to be more responsible in its actions..=\r\n And, here is the catch in the theory of Karma that I believe in, the react=\r\nion process again is exact and divided into a reaction to the body or to th=\r\ne mind or to the life based on the instrument which was used to perform/eng=\r\nage in a specific karma. Now since our ego-sense will identify with these t=\r\no hold them together, so the\n egosense will experience the reaction. We mos=\r\ntly live from our egosense. But soul is hardly the ego. It lies much much d=\r\neeper. Now assuming suddenly that the individual in the next birth has a to=\r\ntal spiritual transformation and is able to manifest the soul and live life=\r\n from it, the reactions may not come or if they do may be highly reduced in=\r\n nature such as not to be of any real consequences. When the soul starts go=\r\nverning an individual instead of his/her egosense, Nature laws for such an =\r\nindividual becomes different from others. \n\n\nIn another model of reality, i=\r\nt is the karana sharir will hold the seeds of the karma. which is never des=\r\ntroyed. But the karana sharir is very different from the normal mind or lif=\r\ne or body. It is more like a super subtle background process in all individ=\r\nuals. To be able to reach consciousness the karana sharir, is a very very h=\r\nigh spiritual achievement. Our karmas are mostly and almost always in the r=\r\nealm of body, life and mind. Karana is way beyond this. A typal repository =\r\nof various things. It is infact only when a person can experience the karan=\r\na sharir that he/she can really enter into the realm of the Great Gods. The=\r\ny are Beings of this karana jagat, typal and fixed in essence, never changi=\r\nng, like the individual karana sharir. Now one can logically ask, so if the=\r\n karana sharir is recording karma, is it not getting fatter? This is a prob=\r\nlem of our logical mind which may not hold true in that realm. If=C2=A0 we =\r\nkeep adding jugs of water to the ocean,\n will it overflow? No. This is quit=\r\ne beyond the normal mind which is limited by its own regimented logic.\n\n\nEa=\r\nch of the sharir is not only an individual&#39;s own but is also effectively an=\r\nd fluidly connected to the whole world of that realm. So with the physical =\r\nwe interact and live in the physical world, with the sukshma we interact an=\r\nd be a part of the sukshma jagat, same with the karan. Only difference bein=\r\ng the depth, intensity and the nature of these three. The Karana is very fi=\r\nxed and supremely subtle. Like a seed. While the sthula is the maximum chan=\r\ngeable of the three. Everything that is there in the sthula jagat is born o=\r\nut of a seed from the karana. As such, nothing in the sthula can go beyond =\r\nthe potentialities held by its most fundamental essence that lies in the Ka=\r\nrana. Hence great Yogis, those who can access this realm at will, can know =\r\nthe most essential nature of a thing by experiencing what a thing is in its=\r\n deepest essence in this Karana jagat, and thus get to know all its possibi=\r\nlities without ever trying to explore them in the physical realm\n or the su=\r\nbtle realm. Quite off limits for most of us.\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\n-Regards\n=\r\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n=C2=A0\n\nI have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee=\r\n in, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee =\r\nlike a hunter through them all.-Sri Aurobindo\n\n\n\nOn Monday, 28 October 2013=\r\n 11:44 PM, Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt; wrote:\n \n=C2=A0 \nDear Na=\r\nrasimha,\n\n&gt;=C2=A0Most of the past life regression therapies ... are just gi=\r\nmmics and/or hallucinations.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoesn&#39;t all sadhana belong in the same bu=\r\ncket?

Everyone,\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;I just t=\r\nhought of adding some clarifications.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;First of all, when I menti=\r\noned about the utility of techniques of &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regre=\r\nssion&quot; for handling the problem of spirit attachments as well as many other=\r\n problems for which we do not have reasonable explanation, my assertions we=\r\nre limited to the utility part only and not beyond that. I have no knowledg=\r\ne about whether past life exists or not, in fact I do not have any knowledg=\r\ne about anything whatsoever, as I believe, any knowledge without the knowle=\r\ndge of the THAT...The Absolute....is half knowledge or no knowledge in the =\r\nproper sense of the term. However, in our this empirical life we have to st=\r\nill continue with life irrespective of the fact of having absolute knowledg=\r\ne or not. Though we know for sure that the Sun does not make rounds of the =\r\nearth but it is the other way around, still we use sentences like &quot;Sun rise=\r\ns=C2=A0in the east&quot;, &quot;Sun=C2=A0sets=C2=A0in the west&quot; etc. To keep life goi=\r\nng, we keep on continuing with activities which\n helps in keeping life go o=\r\nn...It is in this sense that I&#39;d mentioned about &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past L=\r\nife Regression&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;One should not comment about the wealth inside =\r\na sea just by standing at the shore. Life is full of infinite possibilities=\r\n. When we say that the God is infinite, we just can not say that the univer=\r\nse can behave in any particular limited ways. Before anyone comments about =\r\nthe utility of any branch of knowledge one=C2=A0must first take a sincere d=\r\nip into the same. By saying so, I do not mean to say that if=C2=A0one reall=\r\ny takes a sincere dip into any subject one would definitely be convinced ab=\r\nout the same.=C2=A0By saying that one shouldn&#39;t make comments before taking=\r\n a sincere dip, I just mean to say that=C2=A0by doing so one would prevent =\r\noneself from being dogmatic, narrow. Not only=C2=A0blind belief in religion=\r\n and religious practices=C2=A0can be termed as dogmatic but also in science=\r\n if one loses the scientific temper.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;Proof of pudding is in eati=\r\nng it, all that I can say to the persons willing to address any of their pr=\r\noblems. &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot; have immense utility for=\r\n=C2=A0those who are desirous of addressing their problems with an open mind=\r\n.

To cite one example - One girl was having=C2=A0one recurrent bad horr=\r\nifying dream for past 4/5 years and she=C2=A0approached me for the treatmen=\r\nt.=C2=A0But due to my=C2=A0official engagements I was camping at a far off =\r\nplace for around 2 months.=C2=A0Her problem was getting worsened as it=C2=\r\n=A0had=C2=A0 started affecting her professional career adversely. So having=\r\n left with no choice, I agreed to give her a session over phone. The phone =\r\nsession continued for around one and half an hour and she got relieved from=\r\n her that recurrent dream and also started improving her professional life.=\r\n Since that day the dream has not yet visited her again.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;It all =\r\ndepends on the openness of the mind, the strength of the desire to overcome=\r\n etc. The universe is much more than what we see,what we can see and what w=\r\ne can believe to see.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;Regards\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;On Saturday, O=\r\nctober 26, 2013 3:00 PM, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;Namaste,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;To add to the complexity of the problem, I belie=\r\nve our understanding of the reincarnation is over simplified and that cause=\r\ns more problems. Reincarnation is of the soul, and the soul will recall tho=\r\nse specific moments from past lives when the soul had a role to play on the=\r\n external consciousness. Which means if one has lived a life where there ne=\r\nver was any opportunity for the soul to come forth and shine, in later birt=\r\nh it cannot be recalled. For death is a complete process. Body, mind, life =\r\nall get dissolved and new set is generated based on need.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;The Buddhist=\r\ns do not believe in the existence of a soul. They believe in Shunya - which=\r\n is similar to our idea of Atmah.\n Therefore\n their idea of reincarnation\n =\r\nis very different. It is like an energy stream made up of mind, body that c=\r\noalesces together\n to give the impression of an individual being, which upo=\r\nn death get disintegrated and and spread into the greater flow of energy. N=\r\now part(s) of these can coalesce into another formation at a later date, an=\r\nd some other parts can simultaneous or at a different point can coalesce in=\r\nto a different part. =C2=A0 Hence it is possible for a Lama, in their doctr=\r\nine of reincarnation, to have the some parts of his energy reincarnate into=\r\n one body while another part of his energy reincarnate into another body *s=\r\nimultaneously*. Like a Lama may have his energy of speech incarnating in on=\r\ne person, while his energy of mind incarnating in another person, or his en=\r\nergy of body incarnating in another person and all these happening simultan=\r\neously! It fits with their philosophy.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Those philosophies which believ=\r\ned in this kind of a reincarnation looked at the Universe only as a constan=\r\nt flow of energy governed only by a supreme law of\n debts/balances - rna. H=\r\nence\n rnabandhana. Jain scriptures are replete with this term. The final ai=\r\nm of all this is to get rid of the illusion of life and move into a Supreme=\r\n Negation - Shunya/Nirvana. There is nothing here that is of any final impo=\r\nrtance. Hence the tendency towards strict and formal renunciation of life a=\r\nnd its processes.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;But the old Vedantic idea was different. There was a=\r\n soul - that is not dissolved at death unlike body/mind etc - but carried f=\r\norward from one life to another and the chief aim of human evolution was to=\r\n assist and develop this soul&#39;s influence on the earth. The soul inhabits a=\r\nnd uses a human mind/body vehicle for this purpose. The great idea was that=\r\n this individual and unique soul - for no two souls are exactly same - in s=\r\nome birth finally, be able to *consciously* operate on an individual human =\r\nvehicle and enjoy a Divine Life.=C2=A0A Supreme Negation of life is \nnot th=\r\ne ultimate aim, it is only one among many possibilities.=C2=A0 If=C2=A0 mov=\r\ning into a state \nof complete negation/Shunya/Other-world is the final and =\r\ninevitable aim, then there was just no need for Avataras to descend and per=\r\nform complex life-actions. The law of Karma is here too, but it is not rest=\r\nricted to only an idea of give and take of energy as in the case of the ide=\r\na of rnabandhana. The important thing is whether an action is helping the s=\r\noul to unfurl and come forth to the surface. If it does, then it changes th=\r\ne karmic equations immediately. Nature is a massive, complex, unfailing and=\r\n real-time algorithm. That is why a Ratnakara -a bandit who must have kille=\r\nd hundreds of people can transform himself into a Rishi Valmiki [ he did no=\r\nt have to actually get born a hundred times to get killed in the hands of t=\r\nhose he had killed]. Whereas those aspects of life \nwhere the soul has no p=\r\nlay or no scope of play, are firmly governed by \nthe law of rnabandhanas - =\r\na mechanical give and take of energy. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Now since the soul is what r=\r\nemembers and everything else being perishable, the only indestructible link=\r\n between past life and present life, it is only the soul-moments which will=\r\n be recalled, and never a complete cinematic biography recollection. That i=\r\ns fantasizing. Now if there have been lives when the soul had little or no =\r\nfrontal role to play at all, then those are dead and gone and buried six fe=\r\net under with no trace. For Nature, those lives serve no purpose at all. \n&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Moreover all these are possible ONLY if and when an individual st=\r\narts living in and through the soul in a very very strong manner. That is n=\r\not easy. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;-Regards\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I have a hundr=\r\ned lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I wi=\r\nll with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter through them all.-Sri Au=\r\nrobindo\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;On Saturday, 26 October 2013 7:38 AM, Narasimha P.V.R.

I am sure there too o=\r\nne can find good exorcists, maybe not of our religion. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have v=\r\nery little knowledge about Panchamukhi Hanumana, infact unfortunately have =\r\nnever ever tried any sadhana of Lord Hanumana till date.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;However=\r\n, there is a particular mantra of Lord Bhairava which is considered to be o=\r\nf excellent potency for these kind of problems. This form of Bhairava is a =\r\nsmall child, known as Vatuka. As per some Tantrik scriptures He is also ref=\r\nerred to as the one whose mother is Sahashra Chandika. References to this f=\r\norm can be found in the Rudrayamala, at least some versions of the Rudrayam=\r\nala. This child Bhairava has been\n invoked for centuries\n by\n followers of =\r\nShakta/Aghor traditions for protection against spirits, and specially durin=\r\ng rituals\n of cremation ground. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The standard mantra is (there a=\r\nre many variations of this mantra too, all are good):\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Om Hreem =\r\nVatukaay Aapad Uddhaarnnaay Kuru Kuru Vatukaay Hreem Om&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;General=\r\nly, at least 10/11 malas of the same should be done in one sitting. And thi=\r\ns should be continued daily till such time that there is some visible relie=\r\nf. One more thing is that, IF, this is a really genuine instance of spirit =\r\npossession, as far as I have seen, it would be quite impossible to rid the =\r\nproblem by any exorcist from a distance. These days almost no one has that =\r\nkind of terrific shakti to cure a case of possession from a distance. Physi=\r\ncal presence in front of the victim is a must for the one trying to help.=\r\n=C2=A0So close family members, who live with the girl will have to do the s=\r\nadhana. If you go through the Bhairava homam manual by Narasimha, you will =\r\nfind methods of doing homas with this mantra. But I guess being in a foreig=\r\nn land homas may not be that easy.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If the family visits India, t=\r\nhen I have a suggestion. Please ask them, if possible, to visit Kashi and t=\r\nhen go to either the Kalabhairava or Vatuka Bhairava temple. Once inside th=\r\ne temple speak to the main priest stating the problem. Around these two tem=\r\nples in Kashi, many excellent sadhakas of Bhairava live who are adepts in r=\r\nemoving any kind of negative influence. They may charge a certain fee for t=\r\nhe ritual and then ask the parents and the girl to come with some specific =\r\nsamagris on a specific day/tithi inside the temple and then perform their r=\r\nituals. Many I know have actually benefited. This is one method. I am sure =\r\ntheir maybe other methods too. I just wrote what came to my mind. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Hope\n this\n helps.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-Regards\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have a hundred lives before me ye=\r\nt/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatia=\r\nte/ Pursue thee like a hunter through them all.-Sri Aurobindo\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: &quot;b_jamnadas@...&quot; &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Saturday, 10 August 2013 6:36 PM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedi=\r\nc-wisdom] Re: Mantra for protection from spirits (at nighttime)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Namaste.

For there are var=\r\nious classes and kinds and types of entities which can possess an individua=\r\nl and some of them can be downright nasty.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Upayas are many. As s=\r\no many different people have advised, these all sadhanas *can* work, theore=\r\ntically, but whether any one of them will actually work in a specific case =\r\nor not depends on multiple factors. Basically, there is no guarantee of any=\r\n method. It all depends on what kind of spirit(s)/being(s) has possessed th=\r\ne individual and what their link for the same is. By link it means one has =\r\nto find out the root, or source of exactly what action allowed them to ente=\r\nr into the person.\n Sometimes it can be\n something\n as simple as spitting s=\r\nomewhere (where this being(s) reside), or\n causally entering into their ter=\r\nritory and being susceptible to such possession by certain weakness in the =\r\nmind and body, or in some cases where such entities are deliberately send t=\r\no cause harm to an individual, ETC ETC. Whatever be the source, there is no=\r\n sure shot one stop method of removing and handling such a situation. It al=\r\nl depends on the shakti of the spirit, and the amount of shakti that those =\r\ntrying to help are able to generate in order to remove the spirit.Moreover,=\r\n if the spirit of a violent and extremely malevolent nature, then unless th=\r\ne person trying to remove it is an adept in this, he/she may come to seriou=\r\ns harm.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;These things like removing possession are specialization=\r\ns. These do not fall under the ambit of normal sadhana. Unless one knows we=\r\nll what one is getting into, any sadhaka with even basic common sense would=\r\n do best to stay away. Every action has its repercussion and one must know =\r\nwell how to\n handle the same too. Again\n if a spirit is removed by force be=\r\nfore the time till which, based on previous karma, it was supposed to be in=\r\n possession of the individual, then that too starts a new karmic chain whic=\r\nh will involve some not so pleasant consequences for the person who tried t=\r\no remove the spirit. It is all a complex chain.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[Reminds me of a=\r\n particular individual I knew some years ago who was an expert in exorcism.=\r\n But before starting any exorcism he would ask his Guides to tell him about=\r\n the spirit as well as the time frame for which the spirit would stay in po=\r\nssession as per the previous karmic link between the spirit and the victim.=\r\n Then he would sit and do rituals daily to entice the spirit to leave the b=\r\nody of its own free will, promising good deeds for the spirit in return. Ne=\r\nver trying to remove it by force. Most cases it would work. Rare cases wher=\r\ne the spirit is of a very violent nature, force had to be applied.]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Best thing to do is a) find someone\n who knows exactly how to deal with=\r\n spirit possession and hope for the best. b) In the event the first is not =\r\npossible, ask family members to pick sadhana/mantra of any deity - preferab=\r\nly Bhairava, Kali, Chandi, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms=\r\n are better) - and do it with samkalpa with sufficient force and will and t=\r\nime. Which means, a 10-20 mins path of hanuman chalisa may not help. Depend=\r\ns on the degree of possession. Someone may have to spend 3-5 hours daily wi=\r\nth any sadhana with the mental belief/faith/will/determination to see this =\r\nthrough to the very end. While doing the sadhana keep a bowl of water in a =\r\ncopper pot, and then either make the possessed individual drink the water o=\r\nr sprinkle it on him/her. And pray as hard as possible. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Best of=\r\n luck and may God help the family.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-Regards\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0Rajarshi\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have a hundred=\r\n lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will=\r\n with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter through them all.-Sri Auro=\r\nbindo\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;=\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Sa=\r\nturday, 10 August 2013 8:17 AM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra =\r\nfor protection from spirits (at nighttime)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Thank you Nithin, I will convey this to the parents.

I had trouble falling asleep, because I could hear =\r\nstrange noises -  creaking and something moving in the attic. I&#39;m very sens=\r\nitive to different energies - I don&#39;t see anything, but I feel whether some=\r\nthing divine or rather evil is present in a certain place. That place didn&#39;=\r\nt feel good to me.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;I was staying there for 10 days and eve=\r\nry night I would make up because of a feeling of somebody staring at me - I=\r\n could see them but once I started focusing on them, they vanished. Sometim=\r\nes I would wake up in a terrified state breathing rapidly. One day I could =\r\ndefinitely hear some steps near the bed and a roar. I reached for my flashl=\r\night to see nothing.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;This doesn&#39;t seem like sleep paralysi=\r\ns to me - I instantly become fully aware and I can move my body.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Can it be that spirits live in that place disturbing my sleep? There=\r\n were a few more people staying at that place and everybody had severe prob=\r\nlems with sleep, so it&#39;s not just me.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;On the last night I =\r\nchanted Sri Rudram at that place before going to sleep and this was the onl=\r\ny night I was able to sleep properly.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Upon coming back hom=\r\ne from that place I started waking up at home, feeling some strong presence=\r\n - usually some short beings (up to 50 cm in height, I&#39;ve seen them before =\r\nhere though); Once the sun rises, all of the strange feelings disappear and=\r\n I can sleep peacefully.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Is there any mantra that will pro=\r\ntect me from all kinds of astral beings at night? Something that I can chan=\r\nt before going to sleep.

This process is taken care =\r\nof by Nature&#39;s\n laws. These two - desire and need - are slightly different.=\r\n At the moment of death the soul has a specific ability to internalize and =\r\nproject what it needs/wants to experience in the next birth. That gets set =\r\nfirmly. That counts as a desire of the soul. And the basic reaction process=\r\n of actions performed is the need or the consequence to be faced in order t=\r\nhat the egosense can learn to be more responsible in its actions.. And, her=\r\ne is the catch in the theory of Karma that I believe in, the reaction proce=\r\nss again is exact and divided into a reaction to the body or to the mind or=\r\n to the life based on the instrument which was used to perform/engage in a =\r\nspecific karma. Now since our ego-sense will identify with these to hold th=\r\nem together, so the egosense will experience the reaction. We mostly live f=\r\nrom our egosense. But soul is hardly the ego. It lies much much deeper. Now=\r\n assuming suddenly that the individual in the next birth has a total spirit=\r\nual\n transformation and is able to manifest the soul and live life from it,=\r\n the reactions may not come or if they do may be highly reduced in nature s=\r\nuch as not to be of any real consequences. When the soul starts governing a=\r\nn individual instead of his/her egosense, Nature laws for such an individua=\r\nl becomes different from others. &lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;col=\r\nor:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:16px;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, t=\r\nimes, serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;n=\r\none&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:16px;font-family:&#39;tim=\r\nes new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif;background-color:transparent;font-s=\r\ntyle:normal;&quot;&gt;In another model of reality, it is the karana sharir will hol=\r\nd the seeds of the karma. which is never destroyed. But the karana sharir i=\r\ns very different from the normal mind or life or body. It is more like a su=\r\nper subtle background process in all individuals. To be able\n to reach cons=\r\nciousness the karana sharir,\n is a very very high spiritual achievement. Ou=\r\nr karmas are mostly and almost always in the realm of body, life and mind. =\r\nKarana is way beyond this. A typal repository of various things. It is infa=\r\nct only when a person can experience the karana sharir that he/she can real=\r\nly enter into the realm of the Great Gods. They are Beings of this karana j=\r\nagat, typal and fixed in essence, never changing, like the individual karan=\r\na sharir. Now one can logically ask, so if the karana sharir is recording k=\r\narma, is it not getting fatter? This is a problem of our logical mind which=\r\n may not hold true in that realm. If&nbsp; we keep adding jugs of water to =\r\nthe ocean, will it overflow? No. This is quite beyond the normal mind which=\r\n is limited by its own regimented logic.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=\r\n=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:16px;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new y=\r\nork&#39;, times, serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br cle=\r\nar=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div\n style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:16px;font-fam=\r\nily:&#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif;background-color:transparen=\r\nt;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;Each of the sharir is not only an individual&#39;s own bu=\r\nt is also effectively and fluidly connected to the whole world of that real=\r\nm. So with the physical we interact and live in the physical world, with th=\r\ne sukshma we interact and be a part of the sukshma jagat, same with the kar=\r\nan. Only difference being the depth, intensity and the nature of these thre=\r\ne. The Karana is very fixed and supremely subtle. Like a seed. While the st=\r\nhula is the maximum changeable of the three. Everything that is there in th=\r\ne sthula jagat is born out of a seed from the karana. As such, nothing in t=\r\nhe sthula can go beyond the potentialities held by its most fundamental ess=\r\nence that lies in the Karana. Hence great Yogis, those who can access this =\r\nrealm at will, can know the most essential nature of a thing\n by experienci=\r\nng what a thing is in its deepest essence in\n this Karana jagat, and thus g=\r\net to know all its possibilities without ever trying to explore them in the=\r\n physical realm or the subtle realm.
