I was also thinking that.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Fe=\r\nw days back when I went to Calcutta, (where fish is the staple diet), one p=\r\nerson told me confidently that there is no harm in eating fish or meat beca=\r\nuse Swamiji used to do so, and in a Bengali book on the=C2=A0life of Sri Ra=\r\nmakrishna there is one example mentioned where a man came to ask him if sho=\r\nuld quite non veg food, and supposedly Ramakrishna said first leave &quot;Kamini=\r\n&quot; and &quot;Kanchana&quot;, then think of food. =C2=A0Also a similar examples was quo=\r\nted to me from=C2=A0the life of Ma Sarada where - a certain book says - she=\r\n advised an ordinary devotee against leaving fish eating and rather just fo=\r\ncus mind on God.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; When I tried to reason with them that if these =\r\npeople were to come back again on planet earth they may not recommend non v=\r\neg eating - considering the state of the world today - I=C2=A0 was catergor=\r\nically told they are all Trikalagyas, so if there is something wrong in eat=\r\ning fish they would have told right then.=C2=A0 \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Then I tried to=\r\n say that the examples maybe specific individual cases, to which I was told=\r\n, &quot;no&quot;, because based on a whole plethora of such examples even today the m=\r\nonks of the Ramakrishna Order in West Bengal eat and serve fish. This state=\r\nment is a fact. I=C2=A0have had fish meals as prasad in many Ramakrishna Mi=\r\nssions across=C2=A0West Bengal.=C2=A0So, I was told, the monks of the Ramak=\r\nrishna Oder know about teachings of Ramakrishna and Ma Sarada better than u=\r\ns ordrinary people. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I could make no further arguments and of co=\r\nurse had a harrowing time at home trying to convince my parents that I have=\r\n quit non veg food. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; A lot of Bengalis may not have been able to=\r\n implement the basic teachings of Ramakrishna in their lives, however they =\r\nfaithfully follow fish eating as a sanction given by &quot;Thakur&quot; and &quot;Sri Sri =\r\nMa&quot; and &quot;Swamiji&quot;.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; PS: No d=\r\nisrespect to anyone.

However, you are free to address me as =\r\nyou feel like and I&#39;ll happily accept it hence forth.\n&gt; \n&gt; I just came acro=\r\nss Vimalananda&#39; s thought on Karma. He says (and Narasimha has many a times=\r\n repeated) that Karma is only generated (Binding to one) when one self-iden=\r\ntifies with it.\n&gt; Although, it may seem easy to understand intellectually, =\r\nthe state is multiple times difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, it&#39;s an ext=\r\nremely important statement to answer our queries.\n&gt; \n&gt; Important informatio=\r\nn about Vimalananda which I came to know only yesterday is that he was a bi=\r\ng time smoker and there was not a single day passed in his life when he did=\r\nn&#39;t do smoking except on the final day of his departure from physical body.=\r\n He used to as well `chew Tobacco&#39; frequently and occasionally ate meat. I =\r\ngave this information, because as you pointed out (and I also agree) that i=\r\nt is an interesting coincidence of exact thoughts crossing our minds. Furth=\r\ner, please also note an important thing. The Aghori used to say very freque=\r\nntly to all his audience to do what he says and not try to do what he does.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Now whatever I wrote above seems sufficient to answer the questions y=\r\nou asked. Let me put in my thoughts further (Mind you, these are thoughts o=\r\nf an unrealized person and the worth can be next to nothing). When we take =\r\nexample cases of Swami Vivekananda or Vimalananda or Sainbaba or any other =\r\nsuch acknowledged spiritual giants, we tend to forget that they are all rea=\r\nlized souls who achieved very high level of spiritual realization. They are=\r\n knower of everything or many things in the universe. Their individual ego =\r\nis perfectly and completely tuned to universal ego. In short they *know* wh=\r\nat they are doing. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis&#39;. Relevant to our topic of di=\r\nscussion, I would say that if they ate meat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco =\r\nor killed animals, they actually knew what they are doing. There would be s=\r\nurely a specific purpose behind each and every action of theirs because as =\r\nI said, they know complete background behind their each action and\n&gt;  moreo=\r\nver their self identification is missing from the action and hence it is li=\r\nke Nature operates through them to accomplish a special purpose without bin=\r\nding them in any cause-effect chain.\n&gt; Ramakrishna used to frequently say t=\r\no all his disciples that Naren is very different from others. He has a blaz=\r\ning spiritual fire burning within him which can consume anything and everyt=\r\nhing. A food restriction does not bind him. He can eat anything without get=\r\nting spiritually troubled but for others, a kind of food intake is extremel=\r\ny important.\n&gt; If Vivekananda ate meat during his stay in west, it&#39;ll surel=\r\ny have some subtle purpose which is not possible for majority of us to comp=\r\nrehend unless explained by a person of that level. He might be removing `gu=\r\nilt&#39; from the sincere seekers amongst westerners so that he can be accepted=\r\n by them as one of them and then slowly try to eradicate their habits of me=\r\nat eating and such other undesirable habits. It is also possible at the sam=\r\ne time that he is nullifying some balanced Rinanubandha with the `Animal&#39; w=\r\nhose meat he ate. It is also possible that he would have showered his unsee=\r\nn blessings on the animal&#39;s soul by consuming its meat. It&#39;s possible that =\r\nthere were no apparent reasons for that but just a natural inconsequential =\r\nact. We&#39;ll not know. Only Vivekananda, His Guru and Mother Nature know. By =\r\nthe way Vivekananda saved a boy from drowning in a lake in USA while he was=\r\n still in India and did not even planned to go to USA. When the boy, after =\r\nsome\n&gt;  years actually met Swami in USA for the first time, swami immediate=\r\nly told him to stay away from water and when he requested swami to accept h=\r\nim as his disciple, swami, after a moments thought told him that he is not =\r\nhis guru and his guru will come later and will give him Silver Cup as a gif=\r\nt. That man later became disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda and after 40 year=\r\ns, he was actually given a gift of Silver-cup by Yogananda which literally =\r\nfulfilled what swami Vivekananda `knew&#39; before 40 years.\n&gt; \n&gt; Swami Vivekan=\r\nanda was all knowing and most of us are NOT.\n&gt; \n&gt; So moral of my whole writ=\r\nings is that it&#39;s unwise as well as self deluding to take excuses of the un=\r\nconventional habits of Swami Vivekananda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vimalananda, Gaj=\r\nanana Maharaj, Swami Samarth, Trailang Swami and such masters and justify o=\r\nur completely self identified and utterly selfish cruel/unjust actions.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, kri=\r\nshna Kanth &lt;kritels@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal Ji,\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Great coincidence of thoughts!!=C3=82=C2=A0I was about to ask th=\r\nis question today on Non-Veg eating.=C3=82=C2=A0 It is clear from the below=\r\n passage meat eating is not advisable for anyone.=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I was=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0reading a book on Swami Vivekananda (Naa Athma Kadha - in Telugu),=\r\n he clearly wrote that he survived many days on just eating meat when he wa=\r\ns living in USA also relished it.
