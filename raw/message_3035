A kind request - please avoid addressing me with &quot;j=\r\ni&quot;. I am young in age and experience to be addressed with a ji.\n\n  First le=\r\nt me correct myself. On a second look, my words were not accurate. Supramen=\r\ntal transformation is not purely a spiritual state to be attained. It is an=\r\n _integral_ state of being where matter / physical reality is transformed t=\r\no be undistorted expression of the highest consciousness. In that sense, it=\r\n is not a higher spiritual attainment, but a higher _integral_ attainment, =\r\nwhere the constantly changing relative reality of matter and material exist=\r\nence is transformed and the divide between matter and spirit abolished. \n\nS=\r\npiritually, one can argue that there is no higher spiritual attainment than=\r\n attaining / merging with Sat-Chit-Ananda consciousness which is accomplish=\r\ned in Nirvikalpa / Sahaja samadhis. \n\nTo go further into this topic, we hav=\r\ne to touch upon the reality of evolution (not just the bodily evolution) bu=\r\nt evolution of consciousness in matter into more and more conscious forms. =\r\nWhile all Avatara purushas come down from the same source (in a manner of s=\r\npeaking) and the Force behind them is the same, each one comes down for a s=\r\npecific Mission appropriate for that age and collective consciousness of ea=\r\nrth. For supramental transformation to be accomplished by human beings thei=\r\nr various parts of the being such as mind, intellect, nervous system, etc, =\r\nhad to evolve to a certain stage and collective human consciousness had to =\r\ntake a giant leap. All the work of past Avatars were towards achieving some=\r\n of this in some way or other. There is no comparison between Avatars.\n\nWhe=\r\nn we talk about an event yet to happen, we say it is not yet realized on ea=\r\nrth. That does not invalidate all the Giants of the past.\n\nI am sure my exp=\r\nlanation has many holes. If you are really interested in this topic, you ne=\r\ned to go to the source and read all the masterpieces of Sri Aurobindo and t=\r\nhe Mother. His masterpiece, Life Divine is an excellent scripture to unders=\r\ntand this. (Yes, I used the word scripture to describe it, not at all in a =\r\ncasual manner though). \n\nJai Gurudev!\n-Siva.\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Jai Guudev Siva ji,\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;Sri Aurobindo and the Mother maintained that while not yet achieved &gt;on=\r\n earth, it is still possible to reach a stage beyond even Sahaja &gt;Samadhi..=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; This is extremely perplexing.\n&gt; \n&gt; *THERE is a stage in spiritual rea=\r\nlm which is not yet achieved on Earth.

It is a state of intense mental concentrat=\r\nion on something.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kalpa means create or perceive (the word ka=\r\nlpana is from the same root). Vikalpa means existence of variety. Savikalpa=\r\n means &quot;with vikalpa&quot;. Savikalpa samadhi is a state of intense concentratio=\r\nn of the mind, while creational variety or objectification still exists in =\r\nthe mind. One perceives that there is an &quot;I&quot; and there are &quot;other&quot; objects =\r\n(e.g. deities, demons, people etc). But one is able to focus the mind inten=\r\nsely on one object (e.g. a deity) and able to achieve oneness with that obj=\r\nect. Even reaching savikalpa samadhi is a tremendous thing and many great y=\r\nogis also cannot go beyond savikalpa samadhi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In nirvikalpa s=\r\namadhi, the creational variety and objectification ceases (nirvikalpa=3Dnir=\r\n+vikalpa, nir=3Ddevoid of). Mind reaches a state where there is no percepti=\r\non of I and &quot;other&quot; objects. One&#39;s consciousness is absorbed in supreme con=\r\nsciousness (Brahman or Aatman), without any perception of a variety of obje=\r\ncts. This state is reached by very very few yogis.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sahaja sam=\r\nadhi is a state where the mind is *simultaneously* perceiving a variety of =\r\nobjects *and* absorbed in the supreme consciousness!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *       =\r\n *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When one is normally perceiving a variety objects=\r\n, one&#39;s mind is absorbed in an *individualized* consciousness that is color=\r\ned with the conditioning of that individual&#39;s experiences over various live=\r\ns. When one sees a beautiful person, one&#39;s mind may get certain thoughts (d=\r\nepending on the experiences, values and desires accumulated from many lives=\r\n). When somebody is praising one, one&#39;s mind may get certain thoughts. When=\r\n somebody is criticizing one, one&#39;s mind may get certain thoughts. And so o=\r\nn. One&#39;s mind has likes, dislikes, attractions, repulsions etc, based on th=\r\ne accumulated experiences, values and desires of that individualized consci=\r\nousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In sahaja samadhi, one has no individualized conscio=\r\nusness and one&#39;s mind is absorbed in the infinite supreme consciousness tha=\r\nt is not colored by the experiences and conditioning of a single individual=\r\n. One is actively living in the material world; one&#39;s mind is perceiving va=\r\nrious objects of various attributes through jnanendriyas; and, one&#39;s mind i=\r\ns engaging in various actions in the material world though karmendriyas. Ye=\r\nt, one has no individualized conditioning or I-ness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Very ver=\r\ny very few beings, mostly re-incarnations of rishis and gods, can reach tha=\r\nt state. For most others, that state is not really a possibility.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I gave an analogy earlier to explain=\r\n various aspects of consciousness, using parts of a computer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n ahamkaara (I-ness) - CPU\n&gt; &gt; &gt; chitta (conditioning) - DRAM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; buddhi -=\r\n ALU or logic coprocessor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; manas - I/O controller\n&gt; &gt; &gt; jnanendriyas -=\r\n input channels\n&gt; &gt; &gt; karmendriyas - output channels\n&gt; &gt; &gt; praanas - on-boa=\r\nrd power supply\n&gt; &gt; &gt; deha (body) - mechanical parts, chassis etc\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Normally, CPU is running a complex program where a lot of input channe=\r\nls and output channels are active. DRAM has a lot of stored data and CPU is=\r\n refreshing it frequently. ALU is running several algorithms based on store=\r\nd data and a lot of I/O data gets stored/retrieved from DRAM all the time. =\r\nThis is analogous to a person&#39;s normal state.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nirvikalpa sama=\r\ndhi is like a state where the computer is in a power standby. On-board powe=\r\nr supply is hardly supplying any power, all input and output channels are t=\r\nurned off, I/O controller is turned off and ALU is not running any algorith=\r\nms. If a computer goes into power standy and exits it quickly, it will resu=\r\nme what it was doing before. Similarly, a person reaching nirvikalpa samadh=\r\ni and leaving it quickly will resume previous activities. If a computer sta=\r\nys in the power standby for too long, it will be turned off and its state m=\r\nay be lost, i.e. it cannot resume. If one stays in nirvikalpa samadhi for t=\r\noo long, one will simply merge in Brahman and cannot resume previous activi=\r\nties.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sahaja samadhi is akin to a computer running a bare min=\r\nimum program that accesses a program running on a central super computer on=\r\n a network. CPU, ALU, memory etc are running on a central super computer an=\r\nd our individual computer&#39;s CPU simply has a small routine that accesses th=\r\ne results of the algorithm running on the super computer and controls the l=\r\nocal I/O controller accordingly. There isn&#39;t much data stored locally and t=\r\nhere is no algorithm running locally. One&#39;s praanas are supplying power, on=\r\ne&#39;s jnanendriyas are getting inputs and one&#39;s karmendriyas are engaging in =\r\nactions, one&#39;s manas is controlling this Input/Ouput activity and ahamkara =\r\n(CPU) is controlling all this by running a small program that accesses a su=\r\nper computer that is monitoring all the computers of the world and deciding=\r\n what this computer should do.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; As I said, very very very few beings can reach sahaja samadhi and it is=\r\n beyond the reach of even the greatest yogis. As I said, most yogis cannot =\r\neven reach nirvikalpa samadhi. Some reach nirvikalpa samadhi, come back to =\r\nregular consciousness after a while and start to accumulate conditioning ag=\r\nain (chitta, i.e. DRAM). The CPU is running some program or the other, howe=\r\nver small, and accumulating more data in DRAM and building up an algorithm =\r\nin ALU. Minimization of I-ness is possible, but elimination of I-ness while=\r\n embodied is very difficult! If any limited I-ness is left and any conditio=\r\nning (I am this, I need this, I like this etc) is left, then it is NOT saha=\r\nja samadhi. Sahaja samadhi is a lack of limited individual I-ness and conne=\r\ncting the supreme universal I-ness directly to one&#39;s mind and body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I cannot make judgments on individual claims, as it is none of my bu=\r\nsiness. I will take on individuals only when they interfere with my dharma =\r\nand my sense of dharma dictates that I should take them on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; B=\r\nut the bottomline is that sahaja samadhi state is no joke and only yogis of=\r\n an absolutely tremendous caliber reach it. Those who reach this state are =\r\nlike the god - supreme cosmic being - himself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *    =\r\n    *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Let me give another analogy. This life is like a long d=\r\nream. Saviklapa samadhi is like wakig up *within* the dream. Nirvikalpa sam=\r\nadhi is like waking up from the dream. Sahaja samadhi is like being in the =\r\ndream and yet being awake.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This may confuse people, but this =\r\nanalogy shows how complex and difficult sahaja samadhi is. The previous com=\r\nputer analogy highlights how things work in a sahaja samadhi, but does not =\r\nshow why and how difficult it is.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasim=\r\nha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish=\r\n lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish softw=\r\nare (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) w=\r\nebsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha, namaste a=\r\nnd pranaams\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What is sahaja samadhi and how is it different=\r\n from nirvikalpa samadhi?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hari\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Sri Ravishankar is a fully Enlightened Master living in\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sahaj Samadhi all times.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
