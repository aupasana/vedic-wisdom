The first film, Beyond Me, is about consciousness, instincts, personal=\r\nity disorders and evolution and makes a case for how meditation is the solu=\r\ntion for human suffering.  \n\nThe second film, Beyond Belief, presents a cas=\r\ne for Missing Knowledge that Jesus taught and that His authentic teachings =\r\nhave their roots in Vedanta.\n\nNo matter what your spiritual background is, =\r\nthe knowledge in these films applies universally and is very profound & tho=\r\nught provoking.\n\nBoth films are available to view at no charge at\n\nhttp://w=\r\nww.beyondmefilm.com\n\nEnjoy!!\n\nHave a Happy New Year!!\n\nFrank\n\nps--I do not =\r\nmake any money from them and I&#39;m not trying to sell anything.  The sole int=\r\nention is to just share this knowledge in an easy to understand format.\n\n\n"}}
