My former company got\nothers on my\nplace and I haven&#39;t felt good there also. So I quit there. Now there is\nhuge financial problem in my life in this period. Also in the field of\ninformatics I was working, I felt, it doesn&#39;t fulfill me enough. So the\nquestion is when will I find some suitable job in future and what kind of\ncarrier path is the most suitable for me as per the vedic astrology charts\nand signs from knowledge of the great rishis?\nMy purpose is under question in this period and I do not know on which\npath to follow from here? (have a lot of different talents but haven&#39;t got\nthe best of any of them acting, singing, martial\narts,spokesperson,writing,computers,sales...etc.etc.)\nTo be precise I have with my family small private firm that sells\naluminium artifacts but that job also feels big crysis in last years.\n\nOther question considers my present girlfriend. I have a large wish to\nmarry her but the problems I spoke about make her I guess pretty insecure.\nThese days we had some disputes that made us counterparts. So will this\nrelationship last and will it lead to a more secure and stable place in\nthe future or will it end?\n\nMy D.O.B is 12.06.1978\nT.O.B is 14:15 h\nP.O.B is Kragujevac, Serbia\n\nIf some other data is needed please tell.\nNed Petrov\n\n\n\n"}}
