I did not mean to say otherwise. =C2=A0 But just having an ish=\r\nta devata is not enough to be &quot;protected&quot; from deep and troublesome instabi=\r\nlities when one&#39;s body-mind complex goes through a big transformation. Not =\r\nevery aspiring devotee becomes a Prahlada - some become Ravanas. After all,=\r\n out of the two examples Leelaji gave below for &quot;psychological disorder&quot;, t=\r\nhe second lady &quot;did much sadhana of Srirama&quot;. Even those who think of a dei=\r\nty and pray to him/her can end up with hallucinations, mental and spiritual=\r\n disorders, wrong (colored by one&#39;s conditioning and desires!) interpretati=\r\non of internal/external experiences and even madness. =C2=A0 True surrender=\r\n/devotion to ishta devata will definitely protect one, but cultivating it i=\r\ns as difficult as cultivating detachment through wisdom! In fact, true surr=\r\nender and detachment are almost the same. =C2=A0 This is\n why I said that *=\r\nlightness of conditioning* is the most important thing. One with dense cond=\r\nitioning will find SOME way to fail even if a great guru or god are ready t=\r\no help. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 Now, the question is: How do we reduce=\r\n our conditioning? Unfortunately, there is no single magic bullet. Thinking=\r\n of a god, mantras, bhajans, japam, homam etc can help, but they need to be=\r\n augmented by regular introspection and self-improvement. =C2=A0 Taking min=\r\nd away from its current pre-occupations (e.g. &quot;I am smart&quot;, &quot;I am doing goo=\r\nd sadhana&quot;, &quot;I am mad at X&quot;, &quot;I did not get what I deserve in Y&quot;, &quot;I am bet=\r\nter than X&quot;, &quot;I must have Y at any cost&quot; etc etc) is key to eventually over=\r\ncoming conditioning, for these thoughts keep *reinforcing* the conditioning=\r\n! =C2=A0 To reduce the regular pre-occupations of mind, different imagery/v=\r\nisualization may work better for some people. =C2=A0 One approach is to con=\r\ntemplate god whenever possible, in the middle of\n any activity. You can ima=\r\ngine a being in your mind, either as an ideal/able person or as a principle=\r\n/ideal/ability that exists in many beings, that is so perfect and fascinati=\r\nng for the mind to contemplate that it does not care about other objects ar=\r\nound that are making shadripus and ashtapashas work on the mind. Whenever m=\r\nind is about to entertain its regular debilitating pre-occupations, one can=\r\n try to contemplate god instead. =C2=A0 Mind is a wild animal. As Pi says i=\r\nn the movie &quot;Life of Pi&quot; about the tiger on the boat, wild animals can&#39;t be=\r\n transformed or domesticated, but they can be trained into some habits! =C2=\r\n=A0 Whenever one is enjoying a sensual pleasure, if one thinks &quot;the omnipre=\r\nsent God is enjoying this thru this instrument&quot; and starts contemplating th=\r\ne qualities of that god instead of thinking too much about limited sense ob=\r\njects, one is better placed to reduce the damage done by shadripus. Wheneve=\r\nr one is angry at someone for what they did, if\n one thinks &quot;the omnipresen=\r\nt God is giving me the fruits of my karmas thru that instrument&quot; and starts=\r\n contemplating the qualities of that god instead of being angry at someone,=\r\n one is better placed to reduce the damage done by shadripus. And so on. =\r\n=C2=A0 In the beginning, even contemplation of god becomes laced with ego. =\r\nEvery now and then, the activity ends up becoming about oneself rather than=\r\n about god (&quot;*I* am doing this nice bhajan&quot;, &quot;*I* am doing this nice homam&quot;=\r\n, &quot;I think *I* am making progress through this&quot;). With effort and persevera=\r\nnce, one can avoid making it about oneself and keep it centered on the supr=\r\neme power that runs the show. Just as it takes a long time to train a wild =\r\nanimal, it takes a long time to train mind! =C2=A0 Try to develop devotion =\r\nand surrender. Based on all that you read and heard, develop of a concept/p=\r\nrinciple of god that is so superb and fascinarting. Visualize/contemplate t=\r\nhat concept as frequently as possible, especially\n when meditating. When mi=\r\nnd veers off into other things, gently steer it back. Don&#39;t spend too much =\r\ntime dissecting what mind is doing and why. Just put it back gently into co=\r\nntemplating god. Try to make it about god rather than about yourself. =C2=\r\n=A0 The main drawback of the sadhana of most people is that they make it ab=\r\nout themselves at some level or the other. Though that is unavoidable, try =\r\nto break free from it. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 Finally, one can try to=\r\n overcome the limited sense of self and engage in selfless actions that ben=\r\nefit a larger set of people than oneself. What stops us from truly loving g=\r\nod is our deep and sub-conscious love for *ourselves* (i.e. our *limited* n=\r\notion of self that drives the current body-mind complex). One way to overco=\r\nme that is to selflessly love others. After all, other people around us are=\r\n as much replicas of god as we are. If we cannot empathize with them, love =\r\nthem and give them unconditionally,\n how can we ever hope to transcend the =\r\nlimited sense of Self and truly love omnipresent God? =C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;Best regar=\r\nds, Narasimha -------- Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.vedic=\r\nastrologer.org/\n&gt;&gt;&gt;--------\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;_____________________________=\r\n___\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: Leela Sastry &lt;leela.sastry@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@y=\r\nahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, Februar=\r\ny 28, 2013 10:35 PM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Kundalini syndrome\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0Dear Friends ,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0All psychosomatic or sc=\r\nhizophrenic cases are not defined as=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 wrongly=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 experimented=C2=A0=C2=A0kundalini=C2=A0=C2=A0 experiences .

It is =\r\njust A SMALL STEP in overcoming one&#39;s current limited identity.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Let me give an analogy. One wanting to move from one&#39;s small dilapida=\r\nted house (this body-mind complex) to a huge palace (realized Self) may fir=\r\nst construct the palace over time and move into it when it is COMPLETE. Alt=\r\nernately, if one occasionally goes and stays in the palace still under cons=\r\ntruction (analogy for out of body experiences due to Kundalini rise), is it=\r\n an achievement? In fact, it comes with risks. The former approach is safer=\r\n and one loses nothing in it. Similarly, one can progress towards complete =\r\nSelf-realization without any out of body experiences. These are not my word=\r\n&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Secondly,=\r\n one does not get something without wanting it and putting sufficient effor=\r\nt towards it. One may have deeply desired a Kundalini rise in a previous li=\r\nfe and may have put enough effort. As a result, one may be getting it now. =\r\nBut one may be unprepared (and ironically may not even want it!) when it co=\r\nmes in this life.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As you do sadhana, try not to fancy too =\r\nmany specific desires. Nature has a delay mechanism in granting your desire=\r\ns (because of constraints on what Nature can give you right now, arising fr=\r\nom YOUR OWN previous actions). So Nature sometimes gives you what you want =\r\nLATE, when you no longer want it or want something else. For example, one m=\r\nay pray for great wealth one&#39;s whole life and be born as a rich but very si=\r\nck man in next life. One may not enjoy that wealth and pray whole life for =\r\nhealth. In the life after that, one may be very healthy, but not have any k=\r\nnowledge or money. In another case, one may deeply desire to act in a famou=\r\ns film. One may be reborn as a tiger or a dog and act in a famous film, but=\r\n not really enjoy that experience. Basically, people keep going in circles =\r\nthrough various lives, always &quot;seeking&quot; something they are &quot;missing&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Anyway, coming back to Kundalini, if one deeply desires an out =\r\nof body experience given by a rising Kundalini and one&#39;s previous karmas co=\r\nnstrain one from having it in THIS life, one may be born in next life with =\r\nthis specific desire destined to fructify (if there is enough karmik force =\r\nbehind it).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Kundalini ris=\r\ne is not necessarily scary or painful, if one is well-prepared in terms of =\r\nattitude and detachment.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a =\r\nmouse trap. I went to free it and it panicked so badly and started to shake=\r\n violently. I went to save it from a certain slow death and it was scared t=\r\nhat I would kill it!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We are like that chipmunk, glued to t=\r\nhe mouse trap called this body-mind complex and scared of being rescued fro=\r\nm a certain slow death!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If our ideas about who we are (viz=\r\n this current body-mind complex) are incorrect and if we are this &quot;infinite=\r\n Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a complete realization of that at some stage =\r\ninvolve stepping out of this body-mind complex, without being scared?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Kundalini rise after most undes=\r\nirable conditioning is overcome, is far better than Kundalini rise forced w=\r\nhen some really undesirable conditioning is still left in one&#39;s system.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;When one transcends one problematic notion about who one is a=\r\nnd what one needs, another notion that lay buried deeper in consciousness m=\r\nay spring to the surface and torment one. If one overcomes the notion &quot;I am=\r\n the body&quot;, there may be another notion in one&#39;s body-mind complex that one=\r\n&#39;s awareness clings on to (e.g. a great doctor, a great leader, a great sch=\r\nolar, a great saint etc). As an extreme example, if one person had a hidden=\r\n deep desire to be a great soul who rescues the world, he may fancy that he=\r\n is a re-incarnated X or Y who will rescue the world now. When one&#39;s self-a=\r\nwareness (i.e. Kundalini!) deeply clings to any such notion, it can cause h=\r\navoc. The person may show some signs of progress and yet remain in ignoranc=\r\ne and get stuck badly.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;An awakened Kundalini in a system w=\r\nith undesirable conditioning may accentuate one&#39;s weaknesses and wrong noti=\r\nons heavily and cause serious psychiatric and spiritual problems.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The best approach I recommend is t=\r\no NOT think in terms of Kundalini and its rise. Just do sadhana, overcome y=\r\nour weaknesses and improve your detachment over time. Again, I want to emph=\r\nasize that detachment is not disgust or distaste for life/things/people aro=\r\nund you. Disgust is the other side of coin of attachment. It is a negative =\r\nattachment. =C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Don&#39;t worry about whether your Kundalini rises or n=\r\not. Worry about whether you are able to resist 6 internal enemies (shadripu=\r\ns) and 8 bondages (ashta pashas) or not. If your ability to resist them is =\r\nincreasing, you are making progress. EVEN IF your Kundalini is fast asleep,=\r\n you are still making progress. When you completely overcome them, Kundalin=\r\ni (your self-awareness) will automatically ascend to the top and meet Her L=\r\nord (true Self).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;One word on s=\r\nurrendering to a personal deity. Though true surrender is helpful, most peo=\r\nple do not have it. They simply do business with god. Though people may be =\r\noffended by my words, this is the plain and bare fact.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I =\r\nwant X, I will pray to you and please give it to me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of Kunda=\r\nlini rise, I will pray to you and please protect me&quot; - all this is just a b=\r\nusiness deal. There is something you want and you ask god for it. True surr=\r\nender has no place for agendas, desires, demands or expectations. True surr=\r\nender is losing oneself in one&#39;s fascination for the qualities of Lord. Tru=\r\ne surrender is accepting anything Lord throws one&#39;s way (whether it is plea=\r\nsurable or highly painful) as Lord&#39;s prasad and accepting it gratefully. Tr=\r\nue surrender is thinking of Lord with fascination and pleasure, even in the=\r\n face of (and during) Death.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If one without true surrender=\r\n and with many desires and wrong notions experiences a Kundalini rise, one =\r\nmay still be trapped, despite thinking of a personal god. It is not that go=\r\nd does not want to &quot;protect&quot; one as said below. It is not about protecting =\r\nor endangering. If you go back to my &quot;chipmunk glued to mouse trap&quot; example=\r\n above, I was trying to protect it, but it was scared. Similarly, one&#39;s con=\r\nditioning makes one *run away* from God&#39;s protection! God&#39;s protection may =\r\nseem to a conditioned mind like grave danger that one should run away from!=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Whether through the path =\r\nof wisdom or surrender, develop dispassion and detachment. Realize that all=\r\n this is temporary and can be taken away anytime. Enjoy it while you have a=\r\nnd keep doing your best, but be prepared to lose everything anytime. Only d=\r\netachment and a very light mental conditioning (very light desires, dislike=\r\ns etc) can protect one as one&#39;s Kundalini rises to meet True Self. Heavy co=\r\nnditioning and impurities in one&#39;s nadis will distract rising Kundalini (se=\r\nlf-awareness) and stop Her from meeting True Self.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The rea=\r\nl key is how light your conditioning is.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Best regards, Nar=\r\nasimha -------- Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.vedicastrolo=\r\nger.org/\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;--------\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;________________=\r\n________________\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: Leela Sastry &lt;leela.sastry@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To=\r\n: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent=\r\n: Thursday, February 28, 2013 6:05 AM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kun=\r\ndalini syndrome\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0YES=C2=A0 SIR=C2=A0 , perf=\r\nectly correct=C2=A0=C2=A0 ,=C2=A0but intense bhakthi and saranagathi=C2=A0 =\r\nmakes the ishtadevatha to stand by the sadhaka and remove most of the hurdl=\r\nes .=C2=A0=C2=A0All the so called dhyanamargas with out any personal deity =\r\nand manthra allow the other entities to enter in to the inner planes who pl=\r\nay havoc with the=C2=A0 psyche .=C2=A0 Once we are under the protection of=\r\n=C2=A0 a mahadevatha ,all the other=C2=A0 disturbances will definitely=C2=\r\n=A0 be wiped off .

Constant efforts of purification of the various elements that compo=\r\nse the human mind-body structure. In simpler words this translates into mor=\r\ne detachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lus=\r\nt, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, on=\r\ne has to now self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of =\r\na far more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey.=\r\n 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really=\r\n does - it can also open up the mind and body to various other things and e=\r\nntities, some of which are not postive in nature while some of them are use=\r\nless, and given half a chance can make use of the individual for its own en=\r\nds. They take hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and miss-u=\r\ntilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even\n more vital. 4 -=\r\n While someday or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini =\r\nShakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are because =\r\nof this. The human psychology as understood by west today is puerile and in=\r\nsufficient to deal with various things. It is also possible sometimes that =\r\nthe aura of an individual, which protects us from various subtle influences=\r\n and helps us to remain as functional entities, can get &quot;ruptured&quot; due to v=\r\narious reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That=\r\n can allow free assess of various entities inside the mind and they have ch=\r\nances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and variou=\r\ns possiblities are there, it is not possible to list down every option. Mor=\r\neover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few can have the ri=\r\nght knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are =\r\noften doing nothing more than an intelligent guess\n work. Sometimes it will=\r\n have results, sometimes not. For all these to be achieved, the starting po=\r\nint is a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used to say - Me=\r\nns sana in corpore sano. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;aw=\r\naktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyaya=\r\nmanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;________________________=\r\n________\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: v=\r\nedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, 28 February 2013 1:50 P=\r\nM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome based on =\r\nmy recent experience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at p=\r\nresent, and have been involved in the care of someone who seems to think sh=\r\ne has had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since childhood. This =\r\nhas involved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the body. She =\r\nis not of Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms=\r\n started and she searched for an explanation. We have not been able to find=\r\n anything physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that=\r\n this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill descri=\r\nbe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundali=\r\nni awakening- this has triggered interest and research into this topic in m=\r\nainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-understood =\r\nby western medicine, and as we have no treatments for deranged\n kundalini, =\r\nwe struggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. M=\r\ny experience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not =\r\nbe forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at times because the =\r\nsuffering from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her=\r\n, and it is something she cannot escape from. I wondered what solution ther=\r\ne could be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother=\r\n, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- an=\r\nd either cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. May I request tha=\r\nt the good samaritans among you pray for her, and for others like her (whom=\r\n we may not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. And let us be car=\r\neful in our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ourselves. Perhap=\r\ns this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say &quot;=\r\nlet me be your instrument&quot; and leave the kundalini\n rising bit to God&#39;s wil=\r\nl.

The world dissolves into the de=\r\nity and the deity in light and light in Om and the Om in void.&lt;WBR&gt;And then=\r\n only silence remains.&lt;WBR&gt;Absolute silence.&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; \n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: times ne=\r\nw roman, new york, times, serif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMIL=\r\nY: times new roman, new york, times, serif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dlt=\r\nr&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BORDER-BOTTOM: #ccc 1px solid;=\r\n BORDER-LEFT: #ccc 1px solid; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; LINE-HEIGHT: 0; MARGIN: =\r\n5px 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; HEIGHT: 0px; FONT-SIZE: 0px=\r\n; BORDER-TOP: #ccc 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #ccc 1px solid; PADDING-TOP: 0p=\r\nx&quot; class=3Dhr contentEditable=3Dfalse readonly=3D&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Leela Sastry &lt;leela.sastry@yaho=\r\no.com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; &quot;vedic-wis=\r\ndom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Saturday, 2 March 2013 5:08 PM&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom]=\r\n Re: Bhakti (Re: Kundalini syndrome)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv168=\r\n5536178&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1685536178ygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #fff; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, tim=\r\nes, serif; COLOR: #000; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;Total surrender =\r\ncould be of two types ,one is by an enlightened soul or near enlightened so=\r\nul&nbsp; or at least an advanced soul&nbsp;and the other is&nbsp;that&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp; of&nbsp;totally helpless or innocent state .

I did not mean to say otherwise. &nbsp; But just having an ish=\r\nta devata is not enough to be &quot;protected&quot; from deep and troublesome instabi=\r\nlities when one&#39;s body-mind complex goes through a big transformation. Not =\r\nevery aspiring devotee becomes a Prahlada - some become Ravanas. After all,=\r\n out of the two examples Leelaji gave below for &quot;psychological disorder&quot;, t=\r\nhe second lady &quot;did much sadhana of Srirama&quot;. Even those who think of a dei=\r\nty and pray to him/her can end up with hallucinations, mental and spiritual=\r\n disorders, wrong (colored by one&#39;s conditioning and desires!) interpretati=\r\non of internal/external experiences and even madness. &nbsp; True surrender=\r\n/devotion to ishta devata will definitely protect one, but cultivating it i=\r\ns as\n difficult as cultivating detachment through wisdom! In fact, true sur=\r\nrender and detachment are almost the same. &nbsp; This is why I said that *=\r\nlightness of conditioning* is the most important thing. One with dense cond=\r\nitioning will find SOME way to fail even if a great guru or god are ready t=\r\no help. &nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp; Now, the question is: How do we reduce=\r\n our conditioning? Unfortunately, there is no single magic bullet. Thinking=\r\n of a god, mantras, bhajans, japam, homam etc can help, but they need to be=\r\n augmented by regular introspection and self-improvement. &nbsp; Taking min=\r\nd away from its current pre-occupations (e.g. &quot;I am smart&quot;, &quot;I am doing goo=\r\nd sadhana&quot;, &quot;I am mad at X&quot;, &quot;I did not get what I deserve in Y&quot;, &quot;I am bet=\r\nter than X&quot;, &quot;I must have Y at any cost&quot; etc etc) is key to eventually over=\r\ncoming conditioning, for these thoughts keep *reinforcing* the\n conditionin=\r\ng! &nbsp; To reduce the regular pre-occupations of mind, different imagery/=\r\nvisualization may work better for some people. &nbsp; One approach is to co=\r\nntemplate god whenever possible, in the middle of any activity. You can ima=\r\ngine a being in your mind, either as an ideal/able person or as a principle=\r\n/ideal/ability that exists in many beings, that is so perfect and fascinati=\r\nng for the mind to contemplate that it does not care about other objects ar=\r\nound that are making shadripus and ashtapashas work on the mind. Whenever m=\r\nind is about to entertain its regular debilitating pre-occupations, one can=\r\n try to contemplate god instead. &nbsp; Mind is a wild animal. As Pi says i=\r\nn the movie &quot;Life of Pi&quot; about the tiger on the boat, wild animals can&#39;t be=\r\n transformed or domesticated, but they can be trained into some habits! &nb=\r\nsp; Whenever one is enjoying a sensual pleasure, if one thinks &quot;the omnipre=\r\nsent God is enjoying this thru this instrument&quot; and\n starts contemplating t=\r\nhe qualities of that god instead of thinking too much about limited sense o=\r\nbjects, one is better placed to reduce the damage done by shadripus. Whenev=\r\ner one is angry at someone for what they did, if one thinks &quot;the omnipresen=\r\nt God is giving me the fruits of my karmas thru that instrument&quot; and starts=\r\n contemplating the qualities of that god instead of being angry at someone,=\r\n one is better placed to reduce the damage done by shadripus. And so on. &n=\r\nbsp; In the beginning, even contemplation of god becomes laced with ego. Ev=\r\nery now and then, the activity ends up becoming about oneself rather than a=\r\nbout god (&quot;*I* am doing this nice bhajan&quot;, &quot;*I* am doing this nice homam&quot;, =\r\n&quot;I think *I* am making progress through this&quot;). With effort and perseveranc=\r\ne, one can avoid making it about oneself and keep it centered on the suprem=\r\ne power that runs the show. Just as it takes a long time to train a wild an=\r\nimal, it takes a long time to train mind!\n &nbsp; Try to develop devotion a=\r\nnd surrender. Based on all that you read and heard, develop of a concept/pr=\r\ninciple of god that is so superb and fascinarting. Visualize/contemplate th=\r\nat concept as frequently as possible, especially when meditating. When mind=\r\n veers off into other things, gently steer it back. Don&#39;t spend too much ti=\r\nme dissecting what mind is doing and why. Just put it back gently into cont=\r\nemplating god. Try to make it about god rather than about yourself. &nbsp; =\r\nThe main drawback of the sadhana of most people is that they make it about =\r\nthemselves at some level or the other. Though that is unavoidable, try to b=\r\nreak free from it. &nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp; Finally, one can try to ove=\r\nrcome the limited sense of self and engage in selfless actions that benefit=\r\n a larger set of people than oneself. What stops us from truly loving god i=\r\ns our deep and sub-conscious love\n for *ourselves* (i.e. our *limited* noti=\r\non of self that drives the current body-mind complex). One way to overcome =\r\nthat is to selflessly love others. After all, other people around us are as=\r\n much replicas of god as we are. If we cannot empathize with them, love the=\r\nm and give them unconditionally, how can we ever hope to transcend the limi=\r\nted sense of Self and truly love omnipresent God? &nbsp; \n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BAC=\r\nKGROUND-COLOR: transparent; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: arial, helveti=\r\nca, clean, sans-serif; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-SIZE: 13px&quot;&gt;Best regards, Na=\r\nrasimha -------- Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nwww.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.vedicas=\r\ntrologer.org/&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: transparent; FONT-S=\r\nTYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; COLOR: rgb(=\r\n0,0,0); FONT-SIZE: 13px&quot;&gt;--------&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=\r\n=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: aria=\r\nl, helvetica, sans-serif; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: time=\r\ns new roman, new york, times, serif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;&lt;FONT=\r\n size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BORDER-BOTTOM: #ccc 1px solid; BORDER=\r\n-LEFT: #ccc 1px solid; HEIGHT: 0px; FONT-SIZE: 0px; BORDER-TOP: #ccc 1px so=\r\nlid; BORDER-RIGHT: #ccc 1px solid&quot; class=3Dyiv1685536178hr&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Leela Sastry &lt;leela.sastry@y=\r\nahoo.com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; &quot;vedic-=\r\nwisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Thursday, February 28, 2013 10:=\r\n35 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Re: [vedi=\r\nc-wisdom] Re: Kundalini syndrome&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1685536178&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1685536178ygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;B=\r\nACKGROUND-COLOR: #fff; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, serif=\r\n; COLOR: #000; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;Dear Friends ,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;All psychosomatic or schizophrenic cases are not define=\r\nd as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrongly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; experimented&nbsp;&nbsp;ku=\r\nndalini&nbsp;&nbsp; experiences .

Alternately, if one occasionally goes and stays in the pala=\r\nce still under construction (analogy for out of body experiences due to Kun=\r\ndalini rise), is it an achievement? In fact, it comes with risks. The forme=\r\nr approach is safer and one loses nothing in it. Similarly, one can progres=\r\ns towards complete Self-realization without any out of body experiences. Th=\r\nese are not my word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.&lt;BR&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;BR&gt;Secondly, one does not get something without wanting it and putting s=\r\nufficient effort towards it. One may have deeply desired a Kundalini rise i=\r\nn a previous life and may have put enough effort. As a result, one may be g=\r\netting it now. But one may be unprepared (and ironically may not even want =\r\nit!) when it comes in this life.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;As you do sadhana, try not to=\r\n fancy too many specific desires. Nature has a delay mechanism in granting =\r\nyour desires (because of constraints on what\n Nature can give you right now=\r\n, arising from YOUR OWN previous actions). So Nature sometimes gives you wh=\r\nat you want LATE, when you no longer want it or want something else. For ex=\r\nample, one may pray for great wealth one&#39;s whole life and be born as a rich=\r\n but very sick man in next life. One may not enjoy that wealth and pray who=\r\nle life for health. In the life after that, one may be very healthy, but no=\r\nt have any knowledge or money. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN id=3Dyiv1685536178yui_3_7_2_19_=\r\n1362067846619_141&gt;In another case, one may deeply desire to act in a famous=\r\n film. One may be reborn as a tiger or a dog and act in a famous film, but =\r\nnot really enjoy that experience. Basically, people &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN id=3Dyiv16=\r\n85536178yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&gt;keep going in circles through variou=\r\ns lives, always &quot;seeking&quot; something they are &quot;missing&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Anyway=\r\n, coming back to Kundalini, if one deeply desires an out of body experience=\r\n given by a rising Kundalini and one&#39;s\n previous karmas constrain one from =\r\nhaving it in THIS life, one may be born in next life with this specific des=\r\nire destined to fructify (if there is enough karmik force behind it).&lt;BR&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessarily scary=\r\n or painful, if one is well-prepared in terms of attitude and detachment.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap. I went to free it =\r\nand it panicked so badly and started to shake violently. I went to save it =\r\nfrom a certain slow death and it was scared that I would kill it!&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;We are like that chipmunk, glued to the mouse trap called this body-min=\r\nd complex and scared of being rescued from a certain slow death!&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;If our ideas about who we are (viz this current body-mind complex) are i=\r\nncorrect and if we are this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a comple=\r\nte realization of that at some\n stage involve stepping out of this body-min=\r\nd complex, without being scared?&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;K=\r\nundalini rise after most undesirable conditioning is overcome, is far bette=\r\nr than Kundalini rise forced when some really undesirable conditioning is s=\r\ntill left in one&#39;s system.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;When one transcends one problematic=\r\n notion about who one is and what one needs, another notion that lay buried=\r\n deeper in consciousness may spring to the surface and torment one. If one =\r\novercomes the notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there may be another notion in one&#39;s =\r\nbody-mind complex that one&#39;s awareness clings on to (&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN id=3Dyiv1=\r\n685536178yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3Dyiv1685536178userCont=\r\nent&gt;e.g. a great doctor, a great leader, a great scholar, a great saint etc=\r\n&lt;/SPAN&gt;). As an extreme example, if one person had a hidden deep desire to =\r\nbe a great soul who rescues\n the world, he may fancy that he is a re-incarn=\r\nated X or Y who will rescue the world now. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. =\r\nKundalini!) deeply clings to any such notion, it can cause havoc. The perso=\r\nn may show some signs of progress and yet remain in ignorance and get stuck=\r\n badly.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;An awakened Kundalini in a system with undesirable con=\r\nditioning may accentuate one&#39;s weaknesses and wrong notions heavily and cau=\r\nse serious psychiatric and spiritual problems.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR id=3Dyiv1685536178yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_158&gt;The best appr=\r\noach I recommend is to NOT think in terms of Kundalini and its rise. Just d=\r\no sadhana, overcome your weaknesses and improve your detachment over time. =\r\nAgain, I want to emphasize that detachment is not disgust or distaste for l=\r\nife/things/people around you.

There is something you want and=\r\n you ask god\n for it. True surrender has no place for agendas, desires, dem=\r\nands or expectations. True surrender is losing oneself in one&#39;s fascination=\r\n for the qualities of Lord. True surrender is accepting anything Lord throw=\r\ns one&#39;s way (whether it is pleasurable or highly painful) as Lord&#39;s prasad =\r\nand accepting it gratefully. True surrender is thinking of Lord with fascin=\r\nation and pleasure, even in the face of (and during) Death.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;If=\r\n one without true surrender and with many desires and wrong notions experie=\r\nnces a Kundalini rise, one may still be trapped, despite thinking of a pers=\r\nonal god. It is not that god does not want to &quot;protect&quot; one as said below. =\r\nIt is not about protecting or endangering. If you go back to my &quot;chipmunk g=\r\nlued to mouse trap&quot; example above, I was trying to protect it, but it was s=\r\ncared. Similarly, one&#39;s conditioning makes one *run away* from God&#39;s protec=\r\ntion!
