His integrity and\nstro=\r\nng spiritual aspirations earned him an enviable place among Bhagavan&#39;s\ndevo=\r\ntees. He was one of Bhagavan&#39;s intimate companions. His love for\nBhagavan w=\r\nas so great that he surrendered himself unconditionally at\nBhagavan&#39;s feet,=\r\n relinquishing all worldly attachments, and this filled his\nheart with joy =\r\nand peace. He was very modest and never spoke about himself\nand his speech =\r\nwas restricted to the barest minimum. Though he did not\nconsider himself a =\r\nteacher, his life itself served as a valuable lesson in\nspirituality.\n\nPran=\r\navananda belonged to the Sarvepalli family, which was highly esteemed in\nth=\r\ne village of Venkatapuram, near Tiruttani in South India. The Sarvepalli\nfa=\r\nmily was a stronghold of learning in the Vedas, sastras and puranas. The\nfa=\r\nmily deity was Lord Yoganarasimha of Sholingapuram, and Pranavananda was\nna=\r\nmed Narasimham after the family deity. He took the name of Swami\nPranavanan=\r\nda at the time of becoming a sannyasi.\n\nDr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the w=\r\norld famous philosopher and one of the\nmost illustrious Presidents of India=\r\n, was Narasimham&#39;s nephew. Surprisingly\nenough, Dr. Radhakrishnan, who is e=\r\nsteemed for his erudition and wisdom, was\nrather dull as a child. His fathe=\r\nr was very much upset by Radhakrishnan&#39;s\nnature, and concerned about his fu=\r\nture. Narasimham offered to take the boy\nto Vellore and take care of his ed=\r\nucation. Upon reaching Vellore, Narasimham\ninitiated his nephew in the Rama=\r\ntaraka Mantram. Constant repetition of this\npotent Mantram resulted in the =\r\nblossoming of Radhakrishnan&#39;s intellect and\nhe grew into a brilliant studen=\r\nt. He joined the Uris College in Vellore and\npassed his Intermediate course=\r\n. By taking care of Radhakrishnan during the\nformative years of his life, a=\r\nnd by helping him through the initial stages\nof his academic career, Narasi=\r\nmham can be said to have laid the foundation\nfor Radhakrishnan&#39;s success in=\r\n later life.\n\nThe S&#39;arvepalh family was not a wealthy one. It is said that =\r\nthough Goddess\nSaraswati (the Goddess of Learning) showered Her Grace upon =\r\nthe family.\nGoddess Lakshmi (the Goddess of Wealth) looked askance at them!=\r\n Though they\nwere never reduced to extreme poverty, the family never enjoye=\r\nd the comforts\nof affluence. With the intention ofacqiringsome wealth, some=\r\n members of the\nSarvepalli family migrated to Madras, where they were able =\r\nto make some\nmoney by giving discourses in sastras and puranas. Later on, s=\r\nome of the\nmembers settled down in Tiruttani. Narasimham was well versed in=\r\n the three\nSouth Indian languages namely Telugu, Tamil and Kannada. He was =\r\nalso a\nSanskrit scholar. Ironically enough, Narasimham did not get through =\r\nthe\nMatriculation Examination, but his scholarship in English was remarkabl=\r\ne.\nEnglishmen themselves used to marvel at his mastery over the language!\n\n=\r\nNarasimham joined the Arcot Christian College as a teacher. The authorities=\r\n\nwere so impressed by his scholarship and his capacity as a teacher that th=\r\ney\nappointed him as a Munshi (a teacher who trained foreigners in the use o=\r\nf\nlocal languages) to teach Telugu and English to the members of the missio=\r\nn\nand the managers of the institutions under their care.\n\nNarasimham also t=\r\nrained some of the members of the mission in the techniques\nof meditation. =\r\nSome of his students, like Paul Adiseshayya and Ida Scudder\n(who founded th=\r\ne CMC Hospital in Vellore) were so impressed by the clarity\nof thought obta=\r\nined through meditation that they were prepared to embrace\nHinduism if Nara=\r\nsimham advised them to do so. Narasimham did not believe in\nreligious conve=\r\nrsions, and did not think that only Hindus could benefit from\nmeditation. H=\r\ne declared that one could meditate on God even if one did not\nprofess any r=\r\neligion. He told his students that one could serve mankind and\nlive in peac=\r\ne even if one did not belong to any recognised religion.\nNarasimham&#39;s belie=\r\nfs and his teachings astonished the authorities of the\nmission.\n\nNarasimham=\r\n made several visits to the Vellore Central Jail, to meet the\nprisoners and=\r\n to talk to them about moral values. He initiated the prisoners\ninto the Ra=\r\nmataraka mantram and persuaded them to give up their lawless\nways. Through =\r\nhis influence, Narasimham helped in reforming and\nrehabilitating many of th=\r\ne criminals in the jail. He left the Mission\nbecause of some difference of =\r\nopinion with the authorities, and took up the\njob of Munshi in the Police T=\r\nraining College. Many of the Europeans who came\nto Vellore during that peri=\r\nod had the good fortune to learn the local\nlanguage from Narasimham. Those =\r\nwho were spiritually inclined found an able\nguide in him, and his classes b=\r\necame very popular satsangs (spiritual\ncongregations). Very soon, Narasimha=\r\nm gained the reputation of a capable\nteacher and a spiritual guide.\n\nWhile =\r\nNarasimham was serving as a Munshi in Vellore, Kavyakanta Ganapati\nMuni was=\r\n working as a Telugu Teacher in the same town. In 1910, Narasimham\nand Gana=\r\npati Muni went to Tiruvannamalai and met Bhagavan. At that time,\nBhagavan w=\r\nas staying in the Virupaksha Cave. In the very first meeting,\nBhagavan&#39;s lo=\r\nok of grace entered deep into Narasimham&#39;s heart and destroyed\nall the doub=\r\nts that had been troubling him till then. From that moment\nonwards, Narasim=\r\nham&#39;s heart was full of peace.\n\nThough Narasimham had originally accepted G=\r\nanapati Muni as his guru, he was\nproud to declare himself a devotee of Bhag=\r\navan Ramana. He led a very simple\nlife; but he never hesitated to help thos=\r\ne in need. Though his was a very\nmodest house in a crowded street (named Av=\r\nalkaran Veedhi), there were at\nleast ten students staying with him at any g=\r\niven time. He boarded them free\nof charge, and his wife fed them all with t=\r\nhe loving concern of a\nmother.Narasimham had no male issue. This fact did n=\r\not bother him, but his\nwife longed for a son. One day, she requested Ganapa=\r\nti Muni to bless her\nwith a male child. With the Muni&#39;s blessings, a baby b=\r\noy was born, but he\ndid not survive beyond early childhood.Narasimham&#39;s wif=\r\ne was an ardent\ndevotee of Lord Yoganarasimha of Sholingapuram, and she oft=\r\nen visited His\ntemple on the Ghatikachalam hill. Late one evening, while sh=\r\ne was sitting in\nmeditation behind the idols of the Saptha Rishis (Seven Sa=\r\nges) the temple\npriests, who had not noticed her, locked up the temple for =\r\nthe night and\nwent home. The lady claimed that, on that occasion. Lord Yoga=\r\nnarasimha\nHimself brought her out of the locked temple and sat her on the s=\r\nteps\nleading up the hill.Narasimham had no special feeling towards his fami=\r\nly\ndeity, Lord Yoganarasimha. His whole concentration was on the Vichara Ma=\r\nrga\n(path of Self-enquiry) as taught by Bhagavan. In course of time, Narasi=\r\nmham\nrenounced the world and became a Sannyasi, assuming the name of Swami\n=\r\nPranavananda. However, the ritual was a mere formality, as Narasimham had\na=\r\nlways been a Sannyasi at heart, living a life of detachment and devoting\nhi=\r\ns time to spiritual pursuits.\n\nPranavananda considered Bhagavan the very pe=\r\nrsonification of the Vedas and\nthe Upanishads, and so he had great love and=\r\n reverence for him. Bhagavan,\ntoo, had a special regard and concern for Pra=\r\nnavananda.\n\nThe following anecdote serves as an illustration of Bhagavan&#39;s =\r\nconcern for\nhim: Pranavananda used to compile Bhagavan&#39;s teachings into boo=\r\nks. One of\nthe devotees owned a printing press, and he printed the books th=\r\nat were\nbrought to him by Pranavananda. One hot summer afternoon, Pranavana=\r\nnda was\nreturning to Tiruvannamalai with a copy of one of the books. He had=\r\n just one\nrupee with him, and, not wanting to engage a bullock cart, he dec=\r\nided to\nwalk to Ramanasramam. He somehow made it to the gate of the ashram,=\r\n but the\nterrible heat had taken its toll-Pranavananda could not proceed an=\r\ny further.\nHe sat down in the shade of a tree for a short rest before enter=\r\ning the\nashram. At that moment, Bhagavan happened to look out of the window=\r\n. Seeing\nPranavananda&#39;s exhausted attitude, Bhagavan immediately came out t=\r\no him.\nSitting down beside him, Bhagavan poured cool water over Pranavanand=\r\na&#39;s sore\nfeet and spoke to him in gentle, compassionate tones, saying, &quot;Why=\r\n do you\nput yourself to such strain? Did I ever ask you to go out in this h=\r\neat?&quot;\nSuch was the Masters concern for his disciples welfare!\n\nPranavanada =\r\nwas instrumental in printing several books of Bhagavan&#39;s\nteachings. He pric=\r\ned these books at half-anna or one anna and gave them to\nthe ashram. It was=\r\n his desire that Bhagavan&#39;s teachings should be made\navailable to the maxim=\r\num number of people at affordable cost. It was\nPranavananada who first tran=\r\nslated Bhagavan&#39;s Who am I?, Vicharasangraham,\nVivekachudamani and Devikalo=\r\nttaram into Telugu. His style was very simple\nand lucid. In addition to the=\r\nse translations, Pranavananda also wrote\nseveral original books, including =\r\nRama-no. Maharshi Charitramu, Advaitabhoda\nDipika, Tatwamali Dhyanamu, Sri =\r\nGuru-Anugraha-avataramu, Dipamu Choodandi\nand Sri Ramana Stutipaatalu.\n\nPra=\r\nnavananda merged with Bhagavan in the year 1969, and his mortal remains\nwer=\r\ne entombed on the banks of the River Palar, in Vellore. Though\nPranavananda=\r\n is no more with us, his memory lives on, through the numerous\nbooks he has=\r\n written.\n\nSources:\n1)\nhttp://www.arunachala.org/bookstall/books/reminiscen=\r\nces/cherished-m/ch-68/\n2) Arunachala&#39;s Ramana Volume1 Book\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=\r\n=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=\r\n=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd5f122c5e5ea048996daf2\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:=\r\nrgb(51, 51, 51)&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-botto=\r\nm:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bol=\r\nd&quot;&gt;Swarni Pranavananda was one of the earliest devotees to come to Bhagavan=\r\n.

It was Pranavananada who first translated Bhagavan&#=\r\n39;s Who am I?, Vicharasangraham, Vivekachudamani and Devikalottaram into T=\r\nelugu&lt;/span&gt;. His style was very simple and lucid. In addition to these tra=\r\nnslations, Pranavananda also wrote several original books, including Rama-n=\r\no. Maharshi Charitramu, Advaitabhoda Dipika, Tatwamali Dhyanamu, Sri Guru-A=\r\nnugraha-avataramu, Dipamu Choodandi and Sri Ramana Stutipaatalu.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;P=\r\nranavananda merged with Bhagavan in the year 1969, and his mortal remains w=\r\nere entombed on the banks of the River Palar, in Vellore. Though Pranavanan=\r\nda is no more with us, his memory lives on, through the numerous books he h=\r\nas written.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Sources:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;1)=\r\n &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.arunachala.org/bookstall/books/reminiscences/cherish=\r\ned-m/ch-68/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.arunachala.org/bookstall/books/re=\r\nminiscences/cherished-m/ch-68/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n2) Arunachala&#39;s Ramana Volume1 =\r\nBook&lt;div style=3D&quot;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;marg=\r\nin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em;clear:both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;margin-=\r\ntop:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;color:rgb(51,=\r\n 51, 51);font-size:11px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=\r\n=93=E0=B0=82 =C2=A0=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B =C2=A0=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=\r\n=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =C2=A0=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF =C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D =C2=A0=E0=B0=9C=E0=\r\n=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81 =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd5f122c5e5ea048996daf2--\r\n\n"}}
