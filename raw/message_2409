Do not forget this anytime.........Know this body to be in the claws of disease which may swallow it any moment.  Life is ultimately nothing but worry,misery and grief...... Youth flies off  in pursuit of love-making.  As one grows older he is drowned in worry about the security and future of his wife and children. One`s whole life is spent in some kind of\n&gt;&gt; worry or other. And at no stage does man find time to lift his thoughts to God........ When youth is gone, where is lust and its\n&gt;&gt; play?....The pleasures of wordly life are  deceptive appearances.......The hair on the head has either fallen or become grey, the body has become weak, the teeth have totally fallen, the back is bent down and the old man can not take a step  without the aid of stick,yet he does not losen a bit his hold on the bundle of desires........All worries and problems are but a dream, a mere hallucination, born of imagination and delusion....... As readily as one takes to indulging in carnal pleasures, with the same readiness he is taken over by diseases too. Even after seeing death as inevitable and the end of all,man does not refrain from sinful ways&quot;.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;The above quotation should  not be dismissed as a mere sermon.  What a profound  picture of misery and sufferings by the jiva?  Are we  not responsible for our own sufferings and miseries? Pl. brood on this.\n&gt;&gt; Acharya Sankara advises us\n&gt;&gt; to recite(study) the Gita and Vishnusahasranama and lead the mind towards association with the good.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;Arising out of  Acharya  Sankara`s advice, let me just briefly take you   to some pearls from  Bhagawad  Gita having a bearing  on the topic under discussion.  Lord Krishna says, when one completely withdraws the senses from their  objects just like the tortoise withdraws its limbs, he is established in perfect Knowledge.  The senses are so turbulent that they can forcibly lead astray the mind of even  a person of sound judgement.  One with Uncontrolled mind can not have spiritual comprehension,has no capacity for meditation either. For the unmeditative there is no peace. And for one devoid of peace how can there be\n&gt;&gt; happiness?\n&gt;&gt;G.Balasubramanian\n&gt;&gt;__________________________________________________\n&gt;&gt;Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt;&gt;Tired of spam?
