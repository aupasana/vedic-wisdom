If you are doing business with God (I will do =\r\nthis Sadhana, and hence you give me this result, and you break the sadhana)=\r\n, God may punish.\n\nHow ever, if you do sadhana only for self realisation an=\r\nd seek God, God, I am doing sadhana I can, please help me do better and rea=\r\nlise you, God will not punish no matter what. Yes, as Narasimha pointed out=\r\n, in some cases, God may take away certain things to make your spiritual jo=\r\nurney faster, but, that is not really a punishment.\n\nNarasimha, once told m=\r\ne, what you think is good for you or your family may not be really good.

While the stories =\r\nin these books are quite interesting, how many of us in the group truly bel=\r\nieve that these are real incidents that have actually happened? It is easy =\r\nto reject them as a figment of imagination by Robert Svobodha. Or is it tha=\r\nt these stories are supposed have some inner/esoteric meaning and should no=\r\nt be taken literally as real incidents?\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I definitely believe Vim=\r\nalananda existed and what is mentioned here are true. But it is a wrong poi=\r\nnt of debate. Irrespective of whether Vimalananda existed or not, are the i=\r\nnformation mentioned in here related to sadhana, real or unreal? That you c=\r\nan know, only, if you keep trying to do sadhana. Serious sadhana. I=C2=A0di=\r\nd my first homam after reading the first chapter of the second book in 2007=\r\n. During that time I had no clue about this forum or the homam manuals. The=\r\nre is a wealth of information in those books related to practical and serio=\r\nus sadhana. To judge the reality of a book, one must attain a certain level=\r\n. I have not attained any such level where I can pass any realistic comment=\r\n on a book like this, but I start with the presumption that this (the book)=\r\n=C2=A0is true, and the more I do sadhana and cross check with the book, I f=\r\nind what it mentions is indeed true. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Manish, whom=C2=A0I consid=\r\ner as my spiritual mentor, tells me that not only Vimalananda existed but h=\r\ne was a Rishi who lived his life incongnito. He neither wanted fame, not di=\r\nsciples nor anything else. He had a target audience in his mind when he ask=\r\ned Svoboda to write that book. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0For instance, on =\r\nthe chapter on Mantra and mantra siddhi, Sri Vimalananda says the real Gaya=\r\ntri Mantra is hidden and no one knows. And according to him no one can real=\r\nly pronounce a vedic mantra perfectly in these times owing to the influence=\r\n of Kali. At the same time he goes on narrating how to practise a mantra by=\r\n doing japam, homam, tarpanam, marjanam etc. so that siddhi happens! How to=\r\n reconcile these two? \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Not all mantras are Vedic mantras. There =\r\nare lots of pouranik mantras as well. For vedic mantras, pronunciation, int=\r\nonation etc have to be perfect. That is not the case with non-vedic mantras=\r\n. If you can chant a vedic mantra perfectly and follow the rules of purusha=\r\ncharan, then I am sure you will get the results.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; To be more spec=\r\nific, I have tried in the past a purascharana of Savitru Gayatri Mantra for=\r\n a hundred thousand times and was successful in finishing the ritual part (=\r\nand I intend to do a lot more with a lot more discipline), but with the rea=\r\nl Gayatri Mantra being hidden and not in our knowledge, is any there any us=\r\ne in continuing in this path? \n&gt; \n&gt; The savitur mantra is also very potent.=\r\n Anything that comes from the Vedas are potent. There must be some reason w=\r\nhy the real Gayatri is hidden. Maybe most people of this age are unfit to c=\r\nhant and then digest the effects of the real Gayatri. I feel, if you like t=\r\nhe savitur mantra, keep chanting it. It is also a great sadhana in itself.\n=\r\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; He warns that without proper pronounciation and/or disciplines, =\r\nbad things will happen, like the example of Ganapati Mantra Sadhaka dying b=\r\necause of breaking his celibacy! \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; That is mainly when you do a s=\r\nadhana with a sankalpa. If you take a sankalpa, for example you say you wil=\r\nl do X number of japas daily for N number of days while maintaining celibac=\r\ny=C2=A0etc etc, then=C2=A0make sure you do not break it. In the specific ex=\r\nample=C2=A0in the book, Vimalanda had himself given a special Ganesha mantr=\r\na to the person and mentioned the restrictoins to be followed. If one feels=\r\n, one cannot live upto a sankalpa, then why even take one. Just keep doing =\r\njapa/homam/puja with devotion and leave the rest to the deity. =C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Specially, I have been told, if you are doing a sadhana of a Ug=\r\nra devata, and you take a sankalpa=C2=A0for specific number of days=C2=A0an=\r\nd then do not honour it, you may face some very, very=C2=A0severe consequen=\r\nces.

They need a lot more iterations though s=\r\nince I don&#39;t seem to grasp everything that they offer. Anyway, some of the =\r\nquestions that I have at this point are as follows.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. While the stori=\r\nes in these books are quite interesting, how many of us in the group truly =\r\nbelieve that these are real incidents that have actually happened? It is ea=\r\nsy to reject them as a figment of imagination by Robert Svobodha. Or is it =\r\nthat these stories are supposed have some inner/esoteric meaning and should=\r\n not be taken literally as real incidents?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. While there is a wealth =\r\nof information in the second book, and co-incides a lot with Bhagavatham, t=\r\nhere are quite a few places that left me quite confused too. Maybe with the=\r\n help of others from the group, I hope to get a better perspective. For ins=\r\ntance, on the chapter on Mantra and mantra siddhi, Sri Vimalananda says the=\r\n real Gayatri Mantra is hidden and no one knows. And according to him no on=\r\ne can really pronounce a vedic mantra perfectly in these times owing to the=\r\n influence of Kali. At the same time he goes on narrating how to practise a=\r\n mantra by doing japam, homam, tarpanam, marjanam etc. so that siddhi happe=\r\nns! How to reconcile these two? To be more specific, I have tried in the pa=\r\nst a purascharana of Savitru Gayatri Mantra for a hundred thousand times an=\r\nd was successful in finishing the ritual part (and I intend to do a lot mor=\r\ne with a lot more discipline), but with the real Gayatri Mantra being hidde=\r\nn and not in our knowledge, is any there\n&gt;  any use in continuing in this p=\r\nath? \n&gt; \n&gt; 3. Since perfect pronounciation is impossible, he recommends tha=\r\nt mantra sadhana should be done mentally, with not even tongue moving. I fi=\r\nnd this very difficult to practise. At least for me, mind wanders in a craz=\r\ny fashion if Mantra sadhana is practised silently. In fact, it wanders so m=\r\nuch that I start with Ganapati mantra and somewhere along in the middle of =\r\njapa, I realize that my mind is elsewhere and try to come back to the japam=\r\n. What is shocking to me is that at that time my mind is constantly repeati=\r\nng Savitru Gayatri Mantra and not the intended Ganapati mantra. And the ros=\r\nary keeps moving regardless, so the counts are lost........ .\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. He wa=\r\nrns that without proper pronounciation and/or disciplines, bad things will =\r\nhappen, like the example of Ganapati Mantra Sadhaka dying because of breaki=\r\nng his celibacy! This kind of examples could potentially scare many people =\r\nfrom taking to any sadhana at all, in the lack of a proper Guru! And for a =\r\nproper guru, one must keep doing sadhana.... how?\n&gt; \n&gt; Nagraj\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       The INTERNET now has a personality.
