When purush started to create universe(matter,energy=\r\n,antimatter or what ever the physical stuff exists...) Mahattatva was creat=\r\ned this mahattatva holds the three type of Chittas based on their actions. =\r\nHowever, this mahattatva is Maha purush who holds the billion universe in e=\r\nach of his &quot;Randra&quot;. This mahapurush is combination of Purush and prakruti.=\r\n since prakruti is ever changing with time and ever stay stable it is calle=\r\nd dynamic and purush who never changes but always steasy like water in ice,=\r\n he is called dynamic. Everything we see,feel,do is done is time dimension.=\r\n if one of this is absence we will neither be able to exists nor be able to=\r\n feel anything. Hence it is combination of this two causes world to exists.=\r\n As Bhagavat says, before Mahattatva, &quot;Ahamkar&quot; was also created or Mahatta=\r\ntva is &quot;Ahamkar&quot;. Let me just explain something about &quot;ahamkar&quot;. Ahamkar is=\r\n something within which creates reaction. like our reflex, is produce due t=\r\no ahamkar, something sting on hand your other hand goes to scretch or squze=\r\n is due to ahamkar, our vision is due to ahamkar. any ab-normality or any p=\r\nroperty of an object is due to ahamkar. stone ahamkar is keeping stone in s=\r\nhape. Anyway, it is purush and prakruti which makes universe but it by any =\r\nmeans does not respresent gender.\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;pa=\r\nrijat_d&quot; &lt;parijat_d@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste ,\n&gt; \t Thanks a lot to the learn=\r\ned members for clarifying my doubts earlier.\n&gt; \n&gt; I wanted to know about th=\r\ne essence of the concept of purusha and prakriti.Why is it said that purush=\r\na is static and prakriti or shakti is\n&gt; dynamic ?\n&gt; wat is essentially mean=\r\nt by the words..&quot;static&quot;\n&gt; and &quot;dynamic&quot; ??....\n&gt; \n&gt; Lookin forward to hear=\r\n from u all..\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; With best regards,\n&gt; Parijat Dutta\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
