I had posted a message in jHora in response to a forward from Jyotishwrit=\r\nings on &quot;efficacy of remedies&quot;. I humbly agree that jHora is not the right =\r\nforum for discussing these topics.\n\nI have gone through the homam manual pr=\r\novided by Sri.Narasimhaji and the video of a homam being performed and have=\r\n the following observations to make.\n\n1. As per rules laid out by srouta an=\r\nd gruhya sutras which describe the preocedures for various rituals, any yaj=\r\nna (homam) can only be a vikruti of the darsapoornamasa (which is the prakr=\r\nuti of all yajnas).\n\n2. All steps in darsapoornamasa should be there in the=\r\n homam procedure (some exist in tooshnee or amantraka form, but it has to b=\r\ne there). We are nobody to judge which are essential and which are not esse=\r\nntial. They are laid down by vedas and later elaborated by acharyas.\n\n3. Th=\r\nere are variations in procedures in the different sutras such as apastamba =\r\nsutra, bohayana sutra, asvalayana sutra etc., but no omissions.\n\n4. The ord=\r\ninary materials such as fire wood, grains, ghee etc. become worthy of divin=\r\ne usage only when they are divinised using the right procedure. Then only i=\r\nt becomes a divine procedure. Otherwise it is only a &quot;fire ritual&quot; as named=\r\n. I suggest reading of the volumnous work &quot;Agni&quot; by Frits Staal to get a in=\r\nsight into the importance of these steps.\n\n5. The procedure in the manual i=\r\ns not as laid out by any of the sutras. There are large deviations and omis=\r\nsions. It looks like a mix of vedic and tantrik procedures. \n\n6. In parista=\r\nrana or laying the darbha aorund the kunda there is a particular manner in =\r\nwhich the tips of succeeding darbhas are tucked under the bottom of the prc=\r\needing ones.\n\n7. The direction for sprinkling water (mantra parishkekam) wi=\r\nth the mantra &quot;deva savita prasuva&quot; ie:- #4 is shown to be from SE corner t=\r\no NE corner. This can not be because apasavya is for pitru karyas. It is in=\r\n a circle starting from NE corner and ending at NE corner (Eshaadi eeshaant=\r\nam).\n\n8 Patraasadanam or keeping the vessels and ladles used in the vessel =\r\nabove darbha is missing.\n\n9.Prokshanee samskaram and prokshanam for purific=\r\nation of the utensils is missing.\n\n10. Patra samskaram or purifying the ute=\r\nnsils is missing.\n\n11. Praneeta samskaram, varuna avahanam on praneeta, var=\r\nuna poojanam and aacchadanam (covering of praneeta with darbha) is missing.=\r\n\n\n12. Brahma varanam ( at least a koorcha brahma) is missing.\n\n13. Ajya sam=\r\nskaram or purification of the ghee and paryagnikaranam of the homa dravya u=\r\nsed for havan is missing.\n\n14. Darvee samskaram or purification of ladles u=\r\nsed in the homam is missing. Always to spoons are to be used (sruksruvou).\n=\r\n\n15. Placement of paridhi and aagharasamit is missing.\n\n16. Idhma pradanam =\r\nor placement of a fixed number of samits in the agni iis missing.\n\n17. It i=\r\ns seen in the video that with a single dip of the ladle in the ghee, multip=\r\nle ahutis are given in drops. There is fixed quantity of ghee to be given i=\r\nn each ahuti. Otherwise it will lead to dravyalopa.\n\nand many more ........=\r\n....\n\n18. Strictly speaking, in the vedic procedure the deity is not invoke=\r\nd into agni. Agni alone exists in the kunda and he acts as carrier for the =\r\nother gods (havya vahaka). Depending on the name of deity pronounced in sat=\r\nva tyaga, agni carries the offering to the particular deity. If at all deit=\r\ny is invoked it is gaunam (secondary or not necessary)\n\n18. In the tantrik =\r\nprocedure, the deity is invoked into the kunda and the agni acts either as =\r\nthe jadharagni of the deity or the agni itself is converted into the deity =\r\n(agnyatmaka) by offering the specified agni devata aikya ahutis.\n\n19. Very =\r\ngood alternate homa procedures are available in the mantra sastra (refer Ma=\r\nntra maharnava for example) ideal for sadhakas. They don&#39;t involve veda man=\r\ntras so that you don&#39;t have to struggle to get the right pronunciation and =\r\nsvaras. These procedures are designed for mantra sadhakas who perform homam=\r\n on their own. They can be easily adapted to perfrom homam for any devata.\n=\r\n\n20. Homam should not be seen as a 20 minute Jane Fonda work out that can b=\r\ne learned from a video. It involves learning from an able guru and practice=\r\n with devotion, precision and perfection.\n\n21. I suggest that we preserve e=\r\nach branch of knowledge in its own purity. Hybrids may not always yield goo=\r\nd results. Let almighty help to preserve knowledge uncorrupted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-445276210-1277028033=:56824\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;Welcome to this forum.
