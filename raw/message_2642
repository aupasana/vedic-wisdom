In case you forward\n&gt; it to the group, please remove my personal details.\n \nI am sending it to the group by removing your personal references, as several other people may be in the same situation sooner or later.\n \n*        *        *\n \nPoints 1 and 2 could be either meaningful or just simple coincidences. Points 3 and 4 are possible if there is some flow of vaayus in some nadis, to cleanse the nadis. These really sound like premonitory signs before certain experiences.\n \nHowever, if one read about certain visions or experiences in the past and has those desires/memories stored in conscious or sub-conscious mind, then also it is possible to experience similar things.\n \nIf they are hallucinations, they do not help in your spiritual progress. If they are not hallucinations, they should slowly bring some internal transformation. If you see your pride and sense of self-importance go down slowly, if you see your internal reactions to praises and criticism from people start to become more moderated and balanced, if you see your weaknesses such as lust, anger, jealosy etc becoming smaller etc, then you know that you are on the right track. That alone is the measure of progress.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIrresepctive of whether these are hallucinations or genuine experiences, the key thing is: do not get attracted and get stuck. Suppose one is driving on a road going to the top of a mountain. Suppose the scenery at some spot is very beautiful. If one is mesmerized by the scenery and stops there, one will never get to the top. However beautiful the scenery may be, it is just a distraction from the final target. Observe the beautiful scenery that comes before your eyes, but do not develop any attachment with it. It is particularly undesirable to develop an egoistic attachment, e.g. the sense that &quot;I experienced this. I have achieved something. I am worthy.&quot; Just observe whatever is thrown at you and continue the journey.\n \nDo not be attracted to an experience and do not view an experience as either desirable or undesirable. If it comes, let it come. Still focus on the mantra.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIf we put a spark in wet grass, it will take a long time to catch fire. If we put a spark in dry grass, it will catch fire quickly. Similarly, some people will start to experience something quickly when they start a powerful purifying sadhana such as homam. Some people will take longer. Some people may not observe the scenery on the side of the road and keep just looking at the road and suddenly reach the top oneday. Some people may notice all the scenery on the roadside, i.e. observe various experiences. Your path and progress will be decided based on your karmas and vasanas, but it pays to know what the final target is and not be distracted by anything.\n \nYour body is not the real you. Even the subtle body you may have visualized is not the real you. Even the divine light you saw at heart is not the real you. None of what you saw is the real you. The real you is the all-encompassing light apart from which nothing exists. When you are established in the real Self, there is no concept of I, my body, my heart, he, she, you, we, this, that etc. Until that I is discovered, one keeps walking the path.\n \nBut what you described sounds good and you seem to be making progress. Good. Keep your focus and do not be distracted though.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n&gt; Namaste Narasimhaji,\n \nIt has just been about a month since I&#39;ve started doing Ganapati homam. I&#39;m having some very good experiences after I&#39;ve started doing Ganapati homam. However, I&#39;m not sure if these are my hallucinations. I wanted to share the same with you and understand if there are any stages of experiences (I would think the final one would be seeing the almighty Ganapati deva). Please share your thoughts on the same.\n \nI&#39;m sharing this email only with you. In case you forward it to the group, please remove my personal details.\n \nFollowing are my experiences:\n1. I&#39;ve been receiving indications from the almighty Ganapati deva from time to time on my day-to-day activities where some decisions are involved and where I ask the lord to guide me.\n \n2. I&#39;ve literally experienced the &quot;leela&quot; of deva - I&#39;ll narrate one instance (there are quite a number of them). I&#39;d to catch a luxury bus at 8:00 pm one day and all buses were running full till 9:30 pm (for two travel companies). I&#39;d an option to go ahead and check for other travel companies but I felt as if the lord instructed me to go to a certain place and try for one specific 8 pm bus which as per my knowledge was already full. I went there and they offered me a seat near the driver and I was ok to sit there - but the driver asked me to wait for 10 min as it was very hot inside (till the bus leaves). I waited and went to grab a cup of tea. When I came back, I was told that the seat near the driver is gone and now I&#39;m left with a spot near the bus door. In this seat, I certainly cannot afford to take a nap. I told in my mind - &quot;O Lord - I&#39;m so tired&quot;. Now typically, I&#39;d loose my temper and shout at that guy. However, I felt some energy which is\n&gt;  holding my temper. I felt I would burst at the driver but my anger did not come out (even I was wondering why). In next 2 min, the same guy came back to me and told me that one of the seats have been cancelled by some other passenger who did not turn up and asked me to move inside the bus. I was so thrilled and had no words to thank the lord. I was able to have a very good nap - thanks to the &quot;leela of the lord&quot;.\n \n3. While meditating after the homam, I&#39;ve started experiencing some sort of divine light. I was thinking this was my hallucination earlier. But I&#39;m unable to experience this without the homam. Earlier I used to see a yellowish light (not the normal yellow that we generally see - but I know this is a divine one) which used to come and go - and give me a feel that I&#39;m traversing thru a forest at a very high speed. I started seeing some other colors as well. In addition to this, yesterday I saw a divine violet/purple color which was so pleasing - I can say I&#39;ve never experienced like this before. The light started small and then it grew big. And when all this went off and I opened my eyes, I saw that the external fire was also off. I do try sometimes to medidate without the homam, but I dont get such experiences. Is there any way you would suggest?\n \n4. In one instance during meditation, I saw my body which looked very differently. And there was a divine yellow light within my body near my heart. Could this be the internal fire? \n \nFrankly, I dont have words to describe all of these. \n \nIrrespective of whether this a hallucination or the journey towards God, I&#39;m so grateful to you for leading us towards this journey. May the Lord Ganapati shower his blessings on you.\n \nWarm Regards\n&lt;deleted&gt;\n\n\n"}}
