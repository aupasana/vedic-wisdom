With great devotion meditating constantly that =E2=80=98I=\r\n am that Siva the form\nof the one Consciousness that is always unsullied by=\r\n any adjunct,=E2=80=99 dispel\nall your attachments.\n\n48. Giving up all noti=\r\nons about country, caste, blemishless community,\nasrama (status as a bachel=\r\nor, family man, ascetic or one who has renounced\nthe world) and associated =\r\nmatters, hold on to and practise always meditation\nupon the Self, your own =\r\nnatural state.\n\n49. I alone am. No one belongs to me; nor do I belong to an=\r\nyone else. I can\nsee no one who can call me his; neither can I see anyone w=\r\nho is mine. I am\nall alone.\n\n50. Know that the person who experiences the f=\r\nirm conviction, =E2=80=98I am the\nSupreme Brahman, I am the Master and Lord=\r\n of the Universe!=E2=80=99 is the real\nmukta (one who has attained liberati=\r\non), and that the one following\nconflicting paths is in bondage.\n\n51. The d=\r\nay one is able to see oneself with his inner eye as not the body,\nall his d=\r\nesires vanish, and he experiences perfect peace.\n\n\n52. He who is described =\r\nin the scriptures as the unborn and Lord, I am He,\nthe Atman (Self), who is=\r\n forever without form or qualities. There is\nabsolutely no doubt about it.\n=\r\n\n53. I am pure Awareness, immaculate, perfectly liberated;and forever prese=\r\nnt\neverywhere. I am indeterminable. No one can grasp me or leave me. I am f=\r\nree\nfrom sorrow. I am always brahmamayam (of the nature of Brahman).\n\n54. I=\r\n am the Self which is Consciousness, absolute completeness, deathless\nand s=\r\nelf-established, and which is other than this insentient body, limited\nbetw=\r\neen the top of the head and the sole of the foot, and which, beginning\nwith=\r\n the antahkaranas (the inner instruments such as mind and intellect) is\nbou=\r\nnded by the covering of the skin.\n\n55. Thinking, =E2=80=98I am the Lord of =\r\nall creations, moving or stationary, I\nremain as father, mother and father=\r\n=E2=80=99s father for the universe=E2=80=99, aspirants\nfor mukti contemplat=\r\ne with concentration and ardour only upon Me, who am\nthat great turiya stat=\r\ne (the substratum of the waking, dream and sleep\nstates).\n\n56. I am the one=\r\n who is worshipped through sacrifices and penances by all\ncelestial beings =\r\nbeginning with Brahma (the Creator), the heavenly damsels\nwho are themselve=\r\ns sought after, humans, yakshas, gandharvas, nagas and\nother groups of supe=\r\nrhuman beings, and also by many others. Know that\neveryone worships only Me=\r\n.\n\n57. By many kinds of rare austerities and charities,everyone worships on=\r\nly\nMe. Know that this vast creation, moving and stationary, and all objects=\r\n,\nare nothing but Me,\nthe Infinite One.\n\n58. I am not the gross body, nor a=\r\nm I the subtle body. I am also not the\ncausal body. I am the kinsman of the=\r\n universe. I am the One who is of the\nnature of transcendental knowledge. I=\r\n am moreover the eternal One, the Lord,\nthe taintless One,the One who is de=\r\nvoid of the states (of waking, dream and\nsleep), the One who is devoid of t=\r\nhe universe.\n\n59. The beginningless Consciousness is unborn, whole and, res=\r\niding forever\nin its natural home of the Heart-cave, is without form, world=\r\n or impurity.\nIt is beyond comparison and completely unattached. It cannot =\r\nbe comprehended\nby the mind nor can it be seen or felt by the senses.\n\n60. =\r\nRepeatedly see thus: =E2=80=98I am He, the eternal, omnipresent Reality whi=\r\nch is\nBrahman=E2=80=99. Meditating thus for a long time,whoever abides impe=\r\nrturbably will\nbecome the Supreme Brahman, thereby attaining immortality.\n\n=\r\n61. Having thus explained the nature of knowledge to enable everyone to\natt=\r\nain liberation, which is always available, I shall now proceed to\ndescribe =\r\nthe conduct to be adopted by seekers. Noble Lady, listen to them\ncalmly.\n\n6=\r\n2. O Queen among women! Know that bathing in holy waters, repeating holy\nna=\r\nmes or words (mantras), performing daily homa (sacred offering in\nspecially=\r\n prepared fire),worship, other oblations in lustrous fire, or any\nother mea=\r\nns (sadhana) to be followed after great study, are never required\nfor him (=\r\nthe earnest aspirant seeking liberation).\n\n63. Niyamas (strict rules of con=\r\nduct such as what to eat,when to eat, how to\neat, what to wear, where to si=\r\nt and so on),worship of deities in sacred\nplaces, nama archanas (worship of=\r\n deities by reciting sacred names), pitru\nkarmas (oblations,etc., carried o=\r\nut for the sake of forefathers to help them\nreach a high state), pilgrimage=\r\n to holy places which have come forth on\nearth, and observance of great vow=\r\ns, are all not for him (the earnest\naspirant), if considered deeply.\n\n\n64. =\r\nHe does not reap the fruit of actions, good or bad. Important dates and\nspe=\r\ncial observances zealously followed by the world are not for him. Give up\na=\r\nll actions and all kinds of worldly codes of conduct.\n\n65. Renounce complet=\r\nely all religious edicts and disciplines. Since all\nkinds of action result =\r\nin bondage, give up all action plans, mental\nconflicts, and attachment to o=\r\nne=E2=80=99s caste duties.\n\n66. Even if the aspirant acquires many kinds of=\r\n supernatural powers and\nmagical powers such as visualising what is buried =\r\nunderneath the earth, and\ncan demonstrate\nthem before the world, he should =\r\ngive up mental attachment to them.\n\n67. All these (powers) are only bondage=\r\ns to the individual soul. Further\nthey drag one to follow a low path. The s=\r\nupreme joy of liberation does not\nlie in any of them, but only in the Infin=\r\nite Consciousness.\n\n68. One must engage unfailingly in yoga (the practice o=\r\nf Self-abidance) in\nall conditions, without allowing any special event to a=\r\nffect one adversely.\nIf, due to doubts, delusion arises in the form of attr=\r\naction to worship in\nholy places and temples (on account of past practices =\r\nand vasanas), reject\nit immediately.\n\n69. Listen to me, Lady! Know that onl=\r\ny the wise man who never does anything\nwhich leads to the destruction of an=\r\ny form of life, such as insects, worms,\nbirds or plants, is a person who is=\r\n seeking true knowledge.\n\n70. He (the true aspirant) should not pull out te=\r\nnder roots (of fragrant\nplants, which is often done for worship); he should=\r\n not even pluck the\nleaves; he should not harm any living thing out of ange=\r\nr; he should not\nheartlessly pluck even flowers.\n\n\n71-72. He should worship=\r\n Lord Siva using only flowers that have fallen\nnaturally. He should not ind=\r\nulge in vile practices such as marana (causing\ndestruction through the use =\r\nof certain mantras) uchadana (driving one out\nwith the force of mantras), v=\r\nidveshana (causing mutual hatred between\nfriends), the well known sthambana=\r\n (freezing one=E2=80=99s capabilities), causing\nfever, putting into action =\r\nevil spirits,causing agitation, wrongly taking\ncontrol of others, attractin=\r\ng and infatuating others, and so on. Abandon the\nworship of stones, wooden =\r\nobjects and similar articles.\n\n73. Having relinquished the great mudras whi=\r\nch are adopted in order to fix\nthe mind on the devatas (deities) residing i=\r\nn holy places and temples, and\nthe associated\nsacrifices, get rid of the va=\r\nsanas also which may have accumulated on\naccount of such practices in the p=\r\nast, and cling only to the Self, the\nall-pervading real Consciousness.\n\n74.=\r\n Maintain a neutral attitude towards all things; do not get infatuated\nwith=\r\n anything; maintain equanimity whether in happiness or suffering; be the\nsa=\r\nme to friends and enemies; treat alike a broken piece of mud pot and a\npiec=\r\ne of gold.\n\n75. Know that a flawless yogi is one who does not ever allow hi=\r\nmself to be\nswayed by desire for the pleasures of the senses, who frees him=\r\nself at heart\nfrom mamakara (treating things as =E2=80=98mine=E2=80=99), wh=\r\no has a steadfast mind, who is\nfree from desires and fear, and who always r=\r\nevels in the Self.\n\n76. Being unaffected by either praise or slander, treat=\r\ning alike all\ncreatures, he should always unfailingly maintain an equality =\r\nof vision (sama\ndrishti), considering all living beings in the world as him=\r\nself.\n\n77. Avoid unnecessary arguments and worldly associations. Do not cre=\r\nate\nmisunderstanding among others.Do not join religious bodies well versed =\r\nin\nmany scriptures (sastras). Give up both words of abuse and words of prai=\r\nse.\n\n78. Gradually and completely get rid of jealousy, slander,pomp, passio=\r\nn,\nconsequent hatred, desire, anger, fear and sorrow.\n\n79. If a man is free=\r\n from all the pairs of opposites and always lives in\nSolitude (established =\r\nin himself alone), he gains perfect wisdom even while\nin the present body a=\r\nnd shines forth with great effulgence.\n\n80. Liberation is attained only by =\r\nknowledge (jnana). By other powers\n(siddhis) such a fruit is unattainable. =\r\nHowever, aspirants become enchanted\nwith blemishful worldly\nenjoyments and =\r\nthaumaturgic powers (siddhis) and go after them with desire.\n\n81. Know that=\r\n the pure flawless person will experience that blemishless Lord\n(the Suprem=\r\ne Brahman) and positively attain liberation whether attended by\nthe superna=\r\ntural powers or not.\n\n82. The body is a form constituted of the five elemen=\r\nts (earth, water, fire,\nair and ether). The one all-pervading Siva is also =\r\nnicely seated there.\nHence the entire universe,right from the indivisible a=\r\nll-pervading Sivam\n(the highest and most abstract tattva or principle) to t=\r\nhis world, is the\nform of Shankara.\n\n83-84. My dearest, earnest seekers who=\r\n see the enlightened one and worship\nhim with all the three instruments (mi=\r\nnd, speech and body) in unison,\noffering him with\nheart-melting love, sweet=\r\n-smelling sandal paste, fruits,flowers, incense,\ngood water to bathe, cloth=\r\nes and food, will thus attain liberation. Know\nthat those who worship that =\r\njnani reap the fruit of his righteous deeds and\nthose who slander him reap =\r\nthe result of his sins.\n\n85. I have revealed the truth about knowledge and =\r\nthe conduct pertaining\nthereto, as you have asked. This entire path is inde=\r\ned Kalottara Jnana (the\nknowledge to be revealed at the final stage of matu=\r\nrity). Tell me, O Lady,\nif you want to ask anything more.\n\n(Translated by T=\r\n. K.

He (the t=\r\nrue aspirant) should not pull out tender roots (of fragrant plants, which i=\r\ns often done for worship); he should not even pluck the leaves; he should n=\r\not harm any living thing out of anger; he should not heartlessly pluck even=\r\n flowers.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;71-72.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;=\r\nHe should worship Lord Siva using only flowers that have fallen naturally.&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;=C2=A0He should not indulge in vile practices such as marana (causing=\r\n destruction through the use of certain mantras) uchadana (driving one out =\r\nwith the force of mantras), vidveshana (causing mutual hatred between frien=\r\nds), the well known sthambana (freezing one=E2=80=99s capabilities), causin=\r\ng fever, putting into action evil spirits,causing agitation, wrongly taking=\r\n control of others, attracting and infatuating others, and so on. Abandon t=\r\nhe worship of stones, wooden objects and similar articles.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;73. Hav=\r\ning relinquished the great mudras which are adopted in order to fix the min=\r\nd on the devatas (deities) residing in holy places and temples, and the ass=\r\nociated&lt;br&gt;sacrifices, get rid of the vasanas also which may have accumulat=\r\ned on account of such practices in the past, and cling only to the Self, th=\r\ne all-pervading real Consciousness.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;74. Maintain a neutral attitud=\r\ne towards all things; do not get infatuated with anything; maintain equanim=\r\nity whether in happiness or suffering; be the same to friends and enemies; =\r\ntreat alike a broken piece of mud pot and a piece of gold.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;75. Know that a flawless yogi is one who does not=\r\n ever allow himself to be swayed by desire for the pleasures of the senses,=\r\n who frees himself at heart from mamakara (treating things as =E2=80=98mine=\r\n=E2=80=99), who has a steadfast mind, who is free from desires and fear, an=\r\nd who always revels in the Self.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight=\r\n:bold&quot;&gt;76. Being unaffected by either praise or slander, treating alike all=\r\n creatures, he should always unfailingly maintain an equality of vision (sa=\r\nma drishti), considering all living beings in the world as himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;77.&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;=C2=A0Avoid unnecessary argume=\r\nnts and worldly associations.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0Do not create misunderstanding am=\r\nong others.Do not join religious bodies well versed in many scriptures (sas=\r\ntras). Give up both words of abuse and words of praise.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;78. Gradua=\r\nlly and completely get rid of jealousy, slander,pomp, passion, consequent h=\r\natred, desire, anger, fear and sorrow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;79. If a man is free from all=\r\n the pairs of opposites and always lives in Solitude (established in himsel=\r\nf alone), he gains perfect wisdom even while in the present body and shines=\r\n forth with great effulgence.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;80. Liberation is attained only by k=\r\nnowledge (jnana). By other powers (siddhis) such a fruit is unattainable. H=\r\nowever, aspirants become enchanted with blemishful worldly&lt;br&gt;enjoyments an=\r\nd thaumaturgic powers (siddhis) and go after them with desire.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;81.=\r\n Know that the pure flawless person will experience that blemishless Lord (=\r\nthe Supreme Brahman) and positively attain liberation whether attended by t=\r\nhe supernatural powers or not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;82. The body is a form constituted of=\r\n the five elements (earth, water, fire, air and ether). The one all-pervadi=\r\nng Siva is also nicely seated there. Hence the entire universe,right from t=\r\nhe indivisible all-pervading Sivam (the highest and most abstract tattva or=\r\n principle) to this world, is the form of Shankara.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;83-84. My dear=\r\nest, earnest seekers who see the enlightened one and worship him with all t=\r\nhe three instruments (mind, speech and body) in unison, offering him with&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;heart-melting love, sweet-smelling sandal paste, fruits,flowers, incense,=\r\n good water to bathe, clothes and food, will thus attain liberation. Know t=\r\nhat those who worship that jnani reap the fruit of his righteous deeds and =\r\nthose who slander him reap the result of his sins.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;85. I have reve=\r\naled the truth about knowledge and the conduct pertaining thereto, as you h=\r\nave asked. This entire path is indeed Kalottara Jnana (the knowledge to be =\r\nrevealed at the final stage of maturity). Tell me, O Lady, if you want to a=\r\nsk anything more.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;(Translated by =\r\nT. K.
