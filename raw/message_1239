He does hom=\r\nam everyday. Originally, he was doing inside the house with a small fire (a=\r\n few dry coconut pieces). In the summer and autumn, he was doing in his gar=\r\nage with a big fire (wood logs). At that time, he observed that a particula=\r\nr thing was happening within himself during homam. In the winter, he moved =\r\nback inside the house and switched to small fire. The homam was still nice,=\r\n but that particular thing stopped happening. Recently, he did with a big f=\r\nire again and the same thing occurred again.\n \nSo he concluded that homam w=\r\nith a big fire is more effective than homam with a small fire. If doing hom=\r\nam with a big fire increases your fire, he wondered if doing homam with a s=\r\nmall fire lowers your fire. He asked me to shed some light.\n \n*        *   =\r\n     *\n \nLook at it like this. If you spend time in the company of a saint =\r\nwho is more advanced than you, some of the saintly qualities in him may rub=\r\n on you. Similarly, spending some time with a big fire increases the bhoota=\r\nagni inside you and burn bloockages. If one is pure enough already, it can =\r\neven give some experiences.\n \nIf you spend time in the company of a spiritu=\r\nal person who is not of the same stature, it is still a good thing. It is b=\r\netter than wasting time in the company of worldly people. You may not get t=\r\nhe same benefit as you do when you meet a great saint, but atleast your min=\r\nd is thinking about spiritual things.\n \nThus, homam with a big fire is simi=\r\nlar to spending time in the company of a great saint and homam with a small=\r\n fire is similar to spending time in the company of a normal spiritual pers=\r\non. Both are good, but the former is better.\n \n*        *        *\n \nHoweve=\r\nr, those who cannot do homam with a big fire because of the conditions they=\r\n live in can still do homam with a small fire and benefit from it.\n \nBest r=\r\negards,\nNarasimha\n---------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nD=\r\no Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpiritual=\r\nity: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3):=\r\n http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.Sri=\r\nJagannath.org\n-------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----- \n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_010E_01C993A8.5F07B820\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3492&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste=\r\n friends,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;One gentleman asked me a question private=\r\nly.
