During the chapter where Kalika comes out of the third eye a\ngold=\r\nen light with red aura would appear. I was not reciting every\nday, however =\r\nthese lights would appear during my daily routines,\nwork, interactions with=\r\n others, etc, as if Mother was reminding me of\nher presence in all my daily=\r\n affairs.\n\nHow could I be such a dunce so as to get involved with so many o=\r\nther\nmantras and dilute the pure shakti that comes as a result of reciting\n=\r\nChandi?\n\nI have been following these mails and I feel grateful to you\ngentl=\r\nemen for your faith and wisdom.\n\nWarm Regards.................Ajaya\n\n\n\n\n"}}
