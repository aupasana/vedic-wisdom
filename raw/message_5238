Shiva and Vishnu had uncondition=\r\nal love and devotion for each other. They are not like normal human beings =\r\nand their relationships, such as love and devotion, are not governed by pet=\r\nty notions of superiority and dependence.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The Shaivite-Vaishnavite di=\r\nstinctions and the biases of Kali yuga are unfortunate. Nevertheless, I am =\r\nwilling to tolerate biases and closed-mindedness. Closed-mindedness is ok a=\r\ns long as one is making some progress with one&#39;s own belief system.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *=\r\n        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; One climbing a mountain has to choose one of the a=\r\nvailable paths. Whether one acknowledges that several mountain paths lead t=\r\no the mountain top or whether one believes that only the path one has chose=\r\nn leads to the top, is not that important. As long as one is climbing the m=\r\nountain in one&#39;s chosen path, one is doing alright!\n&gt;  \n&gt; After all, there =\r\nmay be many paths around the hill. One may be unable to see paths on the ot=\r\nher side of the mountain or even distant paths on the same side. If one doe=\r\ns not think much of those paths and focuses on climbing in one&#39;s own path, =\r\nthat does no harm.\n&gt;  \n&gt; As one reaches the top, it gets narrower and one m=\r\nay see the other paths that seemed quite distant earlier to be quite nearby=\r\n now. As one is very close to the top, one will see that all paths are lead=\r\ning there. When one is on the top, one sees all paths to converge there. Af=\r\nter god-realization, one sees various paths to be valid paths to god. Of co=\r\nurse, different paths come with different obstacles. One path may have some=\r\n snow. One path may be too steep. One path may be slippery. One path may ha=\r\nve falling rocks. One path may have fallen trees blocking it. And so on. Bu=\r\nt, one on the top knows that people can reach there using several paths, if=\r\n they are committed to overcoming the obstacles and reaching the top.\n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n Let people follow the paths chosen by them and wish them good luck to reac=\r\nh the top in their own paths. Let them say whatever they want to say about =\r\nyour path. It does not matter. If YOU have conviction and faith, you just w=\r\nalk your path and reach the top!\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; The proble=\r\nm is that some people are doing no sadhana really, making no progress reall=\r\ny and yet passing judgments on other paths and getting into fights. They ar=\r\ne like people at the base of the mountain, trying to block people from some=\r\n paths and trying to enroll them in their path. They may fight with people =\r\nand kill them too. They stay at the base forever and never reach the top. T=\r\nhey are a problem.\n&gt;  \n&gt; But, people with narrow views who do some sadhana =\r\nand make progress are ok. They are on some path and will eventually reach g=\r\nod. For example, so many Krishna bhaktas who look down upon Shiva as a lowe=\r\nr demigod may be doing their mantra several malas a day with a good level o=\r\nf devotion and they will eventually make progress. I know Vaishnavas in som=\r\ne sampradayas who do not even worship Ganesha as he is &quot;from Shiva&#39;s family=\r\n&quot; and worship Vishvaksena at the start of their poojas instead of Ganesha. =\r\nBut, they do no harm to anyone, try to see all human beings as Vishnu&#39;s for=\r\nms, try to serve all and keep their austerities. Bottomline is that they ar=\r\ne doing some sadhana and will eventually make progress.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Let us not wo=\r\nrry about people who are doing some sadhana and progressing. Any deficienci=\r\nes in their understanding will be addressed in due course.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The bottom=\r\nline is: Keep doing enough sadhana to burn the conditioning and keep making=\r\n progress.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyoti=\r\nsh Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short H=\r\nomam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n=\r\n&gt;      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt;      Spir=\r\nituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: =\r\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ---------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I hardly disagree with you=\r\nr views but for Iskcon I have my own thoughts,no doubt on Shri Prabhupada a=\r\nnd his mission to spread Shri Krishna&#39;s awareness but many times(After exit=\r\n of Shri Prabhupada)on numerous occasions I found their views very biased t=\r\nowards Shri Shivji and for that reason I have my reservations and those vie=\r\nws of mine are not my own views as some senior ex-Iskconites too share same=\r\n views like me.If I am allowed to speak I have seen very few shivites speak=\r\ning hard stuff like them for opposite side.(Shri Hari or Shri Krishna),not =\r\neven that well known astrologer Sanjay Rath once posted a separate procedur=\r\nes for Vaishnavas to do Mahamrityunjaya japam using Shri Veda Vyasa&#39;s name =\r\ninstead of Shri Vasishtha mantra(Vam Vasishthaya Namah) !

If you see an elephant yourself oneday, you will realize then t=\r\nhat books that seemed contradictory once are not that contradictory after a=\r\nll.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Srila Prabhupada was undoubtedly a great saint. To go abroad w=\r\nithout even knowing anyone there at an advanced age to spread Krishna bhakt=\r\ni, to roam New York streets without proper shoes or clothing in winter, req=\r\nuires tremendous surrender. Based on previous samskaras, some may not be at=\r\ntracted to his interpretations. But that does not take away anything from t=\r\nhem.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My personal favorite is Lord Jnaneshwar&#39;s take on Bhagavad Gi=\r\nta and I also like Aadi Shankara&#39;s commentary overall. However, Srila Prabh=\r\nupada&#39;s commentary is fine too and it is perfect for people with certain sa=\r\nmskaras.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sophisticated and complicated Upanishadic ideas are not p=\r\nalatable to everyone. They need to be simplified. Especially, people from m=\r\nonotheistic belief systems and subscription based religions need simpler mo=\r\ndels of divinity. So Upanishads and scriptures need to be interpreted so as=\r\n to be palatable to them. So many great saints came and interpreted scriptu=\r\nres slightly differently, because there are different groups of people with=\r\n different samkaras waiting to be guided by them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My philosophy is=\r\n simple.

In the former=\r\n, one is cleaning up a dirty place that one is forced to live in. In the la=\r\ntter, one is going to someone else&#39;s dirty place and cleaning it up. If the=\r\nre is some radioactive waste there and one is not protected, one may be aff=\r\nected.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As I keep saying, results of one&#39;s previous karmas =\r\nare like fruits lying in a basket. One takes out one fruit after another an=\r\nd eats them. Some may be tasty and some may be bitter or rotten. When one d=\r\noes rituals and other spiritual sadhana, the deities throw away some bad fr=\r\nuits into a trash can and make one eat good fruits earlier than otherwise. =\r\nBut there may be some spillage as dirty fruits are thrown away. If a priest=\r\n is conducting the ritual, he may be affected by the spillage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; In the old days, priests did intense sadhana and generated enough puri=\r\nty to handle such things. Many priests of today do not do enough penance. T=\r\nhey are quite vulnerable as they start messing with other people&#39;s karmas.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Secondly, many priests of today who conduct poojas are not=\r\n really brahmanas. Being born to a brahmana father is neither necessary nor=\r\n sufficient for one to become a brahmana oneself. One&#39;s aptitude, attitude =\r\nand actions have to be brahmana-like. Many brahmanas today think of power a=\r\nnd influence over others or of money or of comforts. They are not thinking =\r\njust of knowledge and liberation. They are not really brahmanas. In fact, t=\r\nhere are very very few brahmanas on earth right now. Shastras are clear tha=\r\nt rituals can be performed for others only by brahmanas. What it means is t=\r\nhat one desirous of power, influence, money and comforts is unfit to perfor=\r\nm rituals for others.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is there any remedy for this?\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, stop doing rituals for others. Or, do enough individual =\r\npenance when you are not doing rituals for others. Moreover, try to follow =\r\na brahmana lifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspir=\r\ne to truly become a brahmana by overcoming the tendencies of chandalas, shu=\r\ndras, kshatriyas and vaisyas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regar=\r\nding mail 2 below on astrologers:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is not an immature =\r\ncomment and there is an element of truth in it. A lot of what I said above =\r\napplies here too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Every action performed with ego (a sense=\r\n of &quot;I am doing this&quot;) produces an equal reaction. If an astrologer&#39;s actio=\r\nn of giving advice to someone resulted in that person doing X instead of Y =\r\nat kaarmik crossroads and experiencing Z instead of W in coming years, ther=\r\ne is clearly an action here. If the astrologer has some sense of &quot;I am doin=\r\ng this&quot;, then one is bound to experience the fruits of it. Some blessings c=\r\nan come and some sufferings can come too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Messing with som=\r\neone else&#39;s karmas is always a risky business.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What is the=\r\n solution? Well, become a true brahmana. Again, try to follow a brahmana li=\r\nfestyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly be=\r\ncome a brahmana by overcoming tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas =\r\nand vaisyas. Irrespective of where one was born and brought up, one will be=\r\ncome a brahmana if one follows this. Only brahmanas are qualified to play w=\r\nith the karmas of others by giving life-altering advice or by conducting ri=\r\ntuals. Again, to be clear, I am not talking about brahmanas by birth, but a=\r\nbout brahmanas by conduct.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The above will become clear, if=\r\n you look at the criteria laid about by Parasara, Varahamihira etc on who c=\r\nan be taught Jyotish!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free=\r\n Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: =\r\nhttp://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/gro=\r\nup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyo=\r\ntishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mail 1:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- &quot;aksha.rudra&quot; &lt;aksha.ru=\r\ndra@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are present Brahmanas suffering from any curse(S=\r\nhapam)?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This I am asking after seeing the overall and general con=\r\ndition of Brahmanas specially those who do pujas for Yajmanas and involved =\r\nin Karmakanda.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And if this is true is there any remedy for this?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think this is the only place where we can discuss this subject =\r\nhence I am posting this query here.Thanks a lot in advance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Mail 2:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rl_yhoo&quot; &lt;=\r\nrl_yhoo@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimhaji and other educated Scholars,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have just started listening to your (Narasimhaji&#39;s)=\r\n mp3 training sessions and am very eager to review my own chart. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However in numerous instances in the past, I&#39;ve heard through f=\r\nriends and close uncles that astrology can have a severe adverse impact on =\r\nyourself (astrologer) and yrou family. This may sound a very immature comme=\r\nnt, but I thought I should get your opinion / thoughts on this before I pro=\r\nceed on this journey.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would appreciate getting a hon=\r\nest response so I can put this issue to rest once and for all. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Raj\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PS: I am drawn to ast=\r\nology more from an academic perspective of how it influences our life and h=\r\now ignorant we are of this power around us. My goal is to get the little un=\r\nderstanding that I can of this marvelous science and educate our next gener=\r\nation so they are not blinded by modern society and develop / retain respec=\r\nt for astrology and our culture.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
