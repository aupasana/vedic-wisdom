But,=\r\n because you sent your question to me by private email, I am removing your =\r\nname from the mail quoted below to keep your privacy. I hope this is ok wit=\r\nh you.\n \n&gt; On the other hand, as has  been well established, all forms are\n=\r\n&gt; nothing but the same paramthman. Then what is one supposed\n&gt; to do.  Can =\r\nwe with the understanding that each deity is essentially\n&gt; the same paramat=\r\nhman continue to worship the different deities.\n&gt; Should there be any diffe=\r\nrence in worshipping different forms or\n&gt; one form given that all are the s=\r\name paramathman&#39;s form? It is\n&gt; here that the approach of astrology seems t=\r\no be different where\n&gt; depending on dasa bukthi/ gochara an appropriate man=\r\ntra/\n&gt; sadhana is suggested. Is it fine if the sadhana keeps changing\n&gt; ove=\r\nr time?\n \nFantastic question. It is indeed the same Paramatman that express=\r\nes as various objects of this universe, including various deities and vario=\r\nus other beings. Blessed is the one who can see one&#39;s Ishta Devata in all o=\r\nbjects of this universe and not let any so-called &quot;unpleasant&quot; object take =\r\none&#39;s mind away from Paramatman.\n \nBut that is not easy. It is easy to look=\r\n at various idols and various names and say &quot;all these different forms are =\r\nthe same Paramatman only&quot;. But, when one confronts objects and situations t=\r\nhat are quite &quot;unpleasant&quot;, it is difficult to keep that state of mind and =\r\nsay &quot;this too is Paramatman only&quot;. If one wants to see Paramatman in all ob=\r\njects, one should not distinguish between pleasure and pain, success and fa=\r\nilure, praise and criticism etc. If one gets cancer or a terrible disease, =\r\nfor example, and the body starts to pain badly, one should be able to see P=\r\naramatman in that disease, pain and suffering too. Of course, a great saint=\r\n like Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was capable of seeing Kaali in everything and=\r\n even a terrible throat cancer did not deter him or disturb his equanimity.=\r\n\n \nBut, how many can be like that? If health, wealth, family happiness, wel=\r\nl-being of family members etc are very important to someone and one cannot =\r\nwithstand certain &quot;unpleasant&quot; situations with respect to those aspects, th=\r\nen one is not really ready to see the same Paramatman in all. One is mired =\r\nin duality/multiplicity then. The approach needed by such a person is diffe=\r\nrent from that needed by a great saint who can be see the same Paramatman i=\r\nn all people, places, times, objects and situations. Health or disease, wea=\r\nlth or poverty, pleasure or pain, fame or censure, marital bliss or marital=\r\n discord, praise or criticism - such a Yogi sees no difference in all and s=\r\nees the same Paramatman in all. Such a Yogi looks at even the greatest suff=\r\nering as a gift of Krishna/Shiva and does not let it take one&#39;s mind off Pa=\r\nramatman. If such focus, one-pointedness and equanimity of mind is present,=\r\n then there is no need to worship various forms. One can just focus on Para=\r\nmatman. Such a soul is close to moksha. Various shastras like Jyotisha that=\r\n deal with how the maayaa of this world works are irrelevant to such a soul=\r\n, as one is mostly beyond the grip of maaayaa.\n \nBut, one who sees pleasure=\r\n and pain, wealth and poverty, health and disease, fame and censure etc dif=\r\nferently is is in the tight grip of maayaa and hence shastras that shed lig=\r\nht on how the maayaa works are useful. Such a person may want to worship va=\r\nrious forms (like grahas) for specific purposes. This can remove from one&#39;s=\r\n path obstacles like diseases, suffering, pain etc and create a situation t=\r\nhat is conducive to doing sadhana to get a higher level of equanimity event=\r\nually and loosen the grip of maayaa after a lot of effort.\n \nHinduism is fu=\r\nll of teachings for people of various spiritual levels and one should take =\r\nwhat is applicable to oneself. A sadguru can be helpful there.\n \n&gt; Your wor=\r\nds always give so much of clarity and reflect very good\n&gt; knowledge and und=\r\nerstanding of  subtleties.\n \nI am not saying this to sound humble, but I tr=\r\nuly am merely a nimitta. If a crow sits on a coconut tree and a coconut fal=\r\nls from the tree just when the crow lands on the tree, one may think that t=\r\nhe crow actually broke the coconut. But it is a coincidence. This whole uni=\r\nverse is so full of coincidences and the Mother is the manager of this whol=\r\ne show. When I write something, She is the cause and manifestation of the d=\r\nesire inside me to write, the knowledge inside me that drives the writing a=\r\nnd my action of writing. She is also the cause and manifestation of the des=\r\nire inside the reader to understand something from the written words, the a=\r\nction of reading and understanding the written words and the knowledge that=\r\n comes out in the reader after reading. She does everything, through Her va=\r\nrious forms and manifestations. If somebody egoistically feels proud thinki=\r\nng that *he* did something, even that veil of ego is Her manifestation only=\r\n. As one understands and unravels one level of Her manifestation, She shows=\r\n the next level.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------\nHomam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org/homam\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom=\r\n\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotis=\r\nh software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (=\r\nSJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n---------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------\n \n----------- Quoted Mail -----------\n \nDea=\r\nr Narasimhaji,\n                         Your words always give so much of c=\r\nlarity and reflect very good knowledge and understanding of  subtleties.\nSp=\r\necifically you talked about Grahas gripping our consciousness.

Similarl=\r\ny it is talked of as an important step towards realizing the \nself. Proceed=\r\ning on these lines, a specific deity (and that deity alone) \noccupies a per=\r\nson&#39;s mind and life; as in Mira&#39;s case or Tulsidas case where they \nspoke a=\r\nnd thought of none but their chosen deity. Although there is tolerance to \n=\r\nall deities, the japa/sadhana is&nbsp; directed&nbsp; at one form in this \n=\r\ncase.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;On the other hand, as h=\r\nas&nbsp; been well \nestablished, all forms are nothing but the same paramth=\r\nman. Then what is one \nsupposed to do.&nbsp; Can we with the understanding =\r\nthat each deity is \nessentially the same paramathman continue to worship th=\r\ne&nbsp; different \ndeities. Should there be any difference in worshipping d=\r\nifferent forms or one \nform given that all are the same paramathman&#39;s form?=\r\n It is here that the \napproach of astrology seems to be different&nbsp; whe=\r\nre depending on dasa \nbukthi/ gochara an appropriate mantra/ sadhana is sug=\r\ngested.
