But asserting this [as a doctrine] is not right\n=\r\nawareness. Right awareness is just the death of the ego.\n\nWe have seen befo=\r\nre that right awareness =E2=80=93 the experience, in the supreme\nstate, of =\r\nthe real Self as pure consciousness =E2=80=93 is mind-free. Now we learn\nth=\r\nat it is also egoless. The natural state is therefore also called the\negole=\r\nss state.\n\nThe next three verses deal with the problem of controversies, wh=\r\nich abound\nso long as the ignorance is not transcended.\n\n58 Indifferent to =\r\nthe actual experience of the real Self, the sectarians\naffirm their dogmas =\r\nwith fanatical vehemence, saying =E2=80=98There is a reality=E2=80=99,\n=E2=\r\n=80=98There is none=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98It has a form=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98It =\r\nis formless=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98It is one=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98It is\ntwofold=\r\n=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98It is neither=E2=80=99.\n\nThis is the substance of verse=\r\n 34 of Ulladu Narpadu. All the main creeds are\nhere briefly enumerated. Amo=\r\nng these, even the advaitic doctrine is\nmentioned, to show that mere adhere=\r\nnce to a doctrine, even though it is\ntrue, is useless. The last creed, =E2=\r\n=80=98It is neither=E2=80=99, seems to be an\nintermediate creed between the=\r\n advaitic and dvaitic, which is to the effect\nthat the soul is different fr=\r\nom God and yet part of God. These creeds are\npossible because of continuing=\r\n ignorance and an indifference to the quest\nfor the real Self.\n\nThe disputa=\r\nnts resort to logic in order to establish their own creeds as the\ntrue ones=\r\n. But logic is inconclusive. This is stated in the following verse.\n\n59 The=\r\nre is no end to logical discussions, for logic does not come to rest\nanywhe=\r\nre. The supreme transcends the world. How can it become known by the\nlogica=\r\nl mind?\nThe truth of the supreme state is not within the scope of intellect=\r\nual\nspeculation. The sole authority for its nature and means of attainment =\r\nis\nthe actual experience of it by a sage. Logic can proceed only through fa=\r\ncts\ngiven by worldly experience, which is tainted because its parent is the=\r\n\nprimary ignorance. Until one attains that state by the same experience, on=\r\ne\nhas to rely on the authority of a competent Guru.\n\nThe attitude of the sa=\r\nge to the diverse creeds is stated next:\n\n60 Since the sage has no creed of=\r\n his own, he never engages in [useless]\ndiscussions. All creeds are approve=\r\nd by him. He does not [seek to] unsettle\nthe faith of anyone.\nAll creeds ar=\r\ne like paths leading to the same goal. So, the sage does not\nseek to impose=\r\n any faith on anybody, but helps everyone to follow the path\nthat he choose=\r\ns for himself.\n\nIt is the sadhana that is of value, not the beliefs. This i=\r\ns explained next.\n\n61 Therefore, the aspirant should, with a mind at peace,=\r\n cease from hatred\nof other faiths and from all disputation, and engage in =\r\nsadhana as taught by\nhis own faith, intent on winning deliverance.\n\nThe nar=\r\nrow mind, which causes one to assume that one=E2=80=99s own religion is alo=\r\nne\ntrue and all others are false, is a defect of character which must be gi=\r\nven\nup if one is to reach the egoless state, for all religions alike are\nin=\r\nferior to that state. The beliefs inculcated are of no value except as\ninsp=\r\niring zeal for the practice of the prescribed sadhana.\n\nThe earnest aspiran=\r\nt, says Bhagavan, does not need to come to any definite\nconclusion on the m=\r\nost vexed question, which concerns the reality or the\nillusory nature of th=\r\ne world, because the main thing is to know the truth of\noneself. The first =\r\nstep towards that knowledge is just to cease thinking of\nthe world altogeth=\r\ner as an obstacle to one=E2=80=99s quest. This is set forth in the\nnext ver=\r\nse.\n\n62 There are the two [diverse] creeds held, respectively, by those who=\r\n say\nthe world is real and those who say it is unreal. The earnest aspirant=\r\n for\ndeliverance can win experience of the truth of the Self without taking=\r\n up a\ndefinite stand on this question.\n\nThat this seemingly important quest=\r\nion can be by-passed by one who is intent\non becoming free is explained nex=\r\nt.\n\n63 All creatures alike want [perfect] happiness that is unmixed with\nsu=\r\nffering and which will last forever. [This is not wrong because] happiness\n=\r\nis the real nature of all creatures. So one should enquire where such\nhappi=\r\nness can be had.\n\nThat happiness is the very nature of the Self is the grea=\r\nt discovery made by\nall the sages. In the =E2=80=98Bhrigu Valli=E2=80=99 of=\r\n the Taittiriya Upanishad it is said\nthat as a result of this quest for the=\r\n truth he realised this truth, that\nthe supreme reality, the Self, is bliss=\r\n. He also knew at the same time that\nbliss is the source of all living crea=\r\ntures, their support during life, and\nthe goal they have to come back to in=\r\n the end. Bhagavan also used to say in\nanswer to the question =E2=80=98How =\r\nto become free?=E2=80=99: =E2=80=98Go back to the source, out of\nwhich you =\r\ncame forth.=E2=80=99\n\nWhere then is that perfect happiness?\n\n64 To the seek=\r\ner of deliverance who has perfect non-attachment, Bhagavan\ntells in what st=\r\nate that happiness dwells and by what means it can be won.\n\n65 The state of=\r\n deep sleep is dear to all creatures, and it is dear because\nit is happy. B=\r\nut in that state there are no objects of enjoyment! What can\nbe the source =\r\nof this sleep-happiness?\n\nIt is supposed by all people that happiness consi=\r\nsts of a series of\npleasures that come by the contact of external objects t=\r\nhrough the senses.\nBut deep, dreamless sleep is a state of happiness, thoug=\r\nh there are no\nobjects of enjoyment therein. Everyone describes his sleep e=\r\nxperience thus,\n=E2=80=98I slept happily, but I knew nothing then=E2=80=99.=\r\n So this poses a question, rarely\nasked, =E2=80=98What is the cause or sour=\r\nce of this happiness?=E2=80=99 That this question\nneeds to be posed and an =\r\nanswer obtained we learn for the first time from\nthe Guru-sage. Only he can=\r\n give us the answer, which is set forth in the\nnext three verses.\n\n66 Deep =\r\nsleep and the supreme state are similar; in both the mind and the\nworld are=\r\n absent. But in both the mind and the world there is the eternal\nreality, t=\r\nhe real Self. It therefore follows that [the Self] is the cause of\nthe happ=\r\niness in both of these states.\n\nHuman intelligence cannot give this answer,=\r\n but when this fact is revealed\nby the Guru, it is at once seen to be true.=\r\n That the Self does not cease to\nexist, but is present in deep sleep, as in=\r\n the other states, is undeniable,\nbecause, as Bhagavan has pointed out, exc=\r\nepting the highly sophisticated but\npurblind scientists, no one is able to =\r\nsay that he did not exist in sleep.\nThis will be dealt with in detail later=\r\n. So, we learn that the real Self,\nthe supreme state, is the source of slee=\r\np-happiness.\n\nIt is next revealed that this happiness of the Self is infini=\r\nte, whereas the\nhappiness of sleep is nothing when compared to it.\n\n67 The =\r\nhappiness of sleep is fitful and meagre, because the mind survives\nthere in=\r\n seed form. In the supreme state there is infinite bliss, known as\nananda i=\r\nn the vedantic lore.\n\nThe happiness of the mind-free state is perfect. That=\r\n of sleep is not to be\ncompared to it. To distinguish it from the pleasures=\r\n of worldly life, it is\nnamed ananda in the Upanishads.\n\nIt is next shown t=\r\nhat even worldly enjoyment, though seemingly coming by the\ncontact with obj=\r\nects, really has its source in this happiness-nature of the\nSelf.\n\n68 Only =\r\nby receiving a minute fraction of that supreme happiness do all the\ncreatur=\r\nes enjoy life in this abode of the souls. If this source of happiness\nwere =\r\nnot present, who would care to live in this world for even half a\nmoment?\n\n=\r\nThis is what is revealed in the =E2=80=98Ananda Valli=E2=80=99 of the Taitt=\r\niriya Upanishad,\nand all the sages have confirmed this fact.\n\nWhat then is =\r\nthe conclusion? Bhagavan, the Guru, gives the answer:\n\n69 Hence it follows =\r\nthat to all alike the dearest of all things is the real\nSelf that shines in=\r\n the supreme state as pure bliss. Therefore, to all\ncreatures alike the mos=\r\nt beloved of all is that supreme state, and nothing\nelse.\n\nSince it is the =\r\nhappiness of deep sleep that all people love, not the state\nitself, and sin=\r\nce that happiness has its source in the real Self of the\negoless state, it =\r\nwould be right to conclude that what they really love is\nthat Self, and the=\r\n state in which its true nature is included, though only\nunknowingly. This =\r\nis exactly what the Sage Yajnavalkya told his wise wife,\nMaitreyi, in this =\r\npassage: =E2=80=98Not for the sake of the husband is the husband\ndear, but =\r\nfor the sake of the Self is the husband dear; nor for the sake of\nthe wife =\r\nis the wife dear, but for the sake of the Self is the wife dear.=E2=80=99\nA=\r\nnd on to the end of the passage: =E2=80=98Not for the sake of anything is t=\r\nhat\nthing dear, but for the sake of the Self is anything dear.=E2=80=99\n\nIt=\r\n is due to ignorance of the Self that the love that we bear for the Self\nis=\r\n mistakenly interpreted as love for something or other. So the problem of\nf=\r\ninding real happiness and escaping from suffering is solved only by\nbecomin=\r\ng aware of the Self as it really is. The teaching is proved by the\nnext pas=\r\nsage that concludes with the declaration that the Self is all that\nthere is=\r\n.\n\nIf this teaching is accepted, what then is the use of the enquiry about =\r\nthe\nreality or unreality of the world?\n\n70 For the aspirant who has thus le=\r\narned from the sage-Guru that the supreme\nstate is the home of eternal happ=\r\niness, and who is therefore indifferent to\nthis world and intent on =E2=80=\r\n=98winning=E2=80=99 that State, what is the use of any\nenquiry concerning t=\r\nhe world?\n\nThat is explained next.\n\n71 Let the world be real or otherwise. =\r\nWhat is there in it for this aspirant\nto strive for? And let the reality in=\r\n the supreme state be non-dual or\notherwise. It is That alone that he wants=\r\n to win, naught else.\n\nThe two questions, one concerning the reality of the=\r\n world, the other\nconcerning the non-duality of the real Self, are really o=\r\nne. Both questions\nbecome superfluous for one who has resolved to strive fo=\r\nr that state.\n\nThere is also another reason for this.\n\n72 Only by becoming =\r\nfirmly established in the real Self of that supreme\nstate can one know defi=\r\nnitely whether that reality is non-dual or not. How\ncan anyone become aware=\r\n of that truth while still wandering confusedly in\nthe three states?\n\nBhaga=\r\nvan gives the following analogy to impress this fact.\n\n73 Just as it is pro=\r\nper to throw away the heap of shorn hair without\nscrutinising it, so it is =\r\nright for the aspirant to turn away from the\nworld, which [for him] is of n=\r\no value, without enquiry concerning it.\n\n74 The aspirant will naturally tur=\r\nn away from the world at once and, with\nhis mind turned inwards, will striv=\r\ne for the goal. It is by turning the mind\naway from the world that the ques=\r\nt is made, and for that reason the world is\ncertainly to be renounced.\n\nThe=\r\n quest taught by the Master implies turning away from the world. The mind\nh=\r\nas to be turned inwards towards the Self because it dwells within. But this=\r\n\nhas been said for the fully ripe aspirant who is not attached to the world=\r\n.\nFor those who are not yet ripe for the quest, this enquiry is not useless=\r\n,\nas will be seen presently.\n\n75 But those who have not the needed strength=\r\n of nonattachment, believing,\nas they do, that the world is real in its own=\r\n right, cannot turn the mind\ninwards for the quest; so, for them, this enqu=\r\niry is surely needful.\n\n76 These, by making the enquiry on the lines indica=\r\nted by the Master, would\nbecome convinced that the world is not real in its=\r\n own right. Then, by\nreflecting on this truth, they will become able, by de=\r\ngrees, to turn their\nminds inwards.\n\nThis knowledge is therefore not a mere=\r\n luxury of speculative philosophy, but\nis of practical value, as shown here=\r\n. The necessity for guidance by the\nMaster in making this inquest on the wo=\r\nrld is next explained.\n\n77 An enquiry conducted on the basis of worldly exp=\r\nerience [alone], by\nreliance on one=E2=80=99s own [unaided] intelligence, i=\r\ns vain. One should resort to\na Guru who is a sage and make this inquest on =\r\nthe world as guided by him.\n\nNo enquiry can be made in a vacuum, but only o=\r\nn the basis of reliable\nevidence. Speculative philosophers, as in the West,=\r\n proceed on the false\nassumption that worldly experience, the offspring of =\r\nthe primary ignorance,\nis good enough to be used as evidence for coming to =\r\na conclusion on a truth\nthat transcends the world. Also, they believe that =\r\ntheir intelligence is\nequal to the task of making a dispassionate enquiry. =\r\nThe knowledge derived\nfrom worldly experience is ignorance. Hence, it canno=\r\nt be used as evidence.\nIf relied on, it will lead to wrong conclusions. The=\r\n reason is next given\nbriefly.\n\n78 All worldly experience is rooted in igno=\r\nrance. It is dream-like; it takes\nplace in worldliness; it pertains to men =\r\nignorant [of the real Self]; and it\nis false. It is therefore no evidence f=\r\nor the seeker of deliverance in\n[this] discrimination between the real and =\r\nthe unreal.\n\nIt has been explained that the three states of life, waking, d=\r\nream and\nsleep, take place in the profound sleep of ignorance, and hence ev=\r\nen waking\nexperience is dreamlike. And this enquiry involves disentangling =\r\nthe real\nfrom the unreal. Worldly\nexperience is at best suspect; its realit=\r\ny is itself in question. It is\ninseparable from the world, whose reality is=\r\n in question. It must not\ntherefore be assumed to be valid evidence. What t=\r\nhen is valid evidence?\n\nSource: http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro=\r\n.shtml\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=\r\n=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=\r\n=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd6c92469f9e3049edb0eef\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n57 It is only the one supreme reality that appears as the three,=\r\n namely the world, God and the soul.

The last cr=\r\need, =E2=80=98It is neither=E2=80=99, seems to be an intermediate creed bet=\r\nween the advaitic and dvaitic, which is to the effect that the soul is diff=\r\nerent from God and yet part of God. These creeds are possible because of co=\r\nntinuing ignorance and an indifference to the quest for the real Self.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;The disputants resort to logic in order to establish their own creeds =\r\nas the true ones. But logic is inconclusive. This is stated in the followin=\r\ng verse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;59 There is no end to logical discussions, for logic does n=\r\not come to rest anywhere.

So one should=\r\n enquire where such happiness can be had.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;That happiness is=\r\n the very nature of the Self is the great discovery made by all the sages. =\r\nIn the =E2=80=98Bhrigu Valli=E2=80=99 of the Taittiriya Upanishad it is sai=\r\nd that as a result of this quest for the truth he realised this truth, that=\r\n the supreme reality, the Self, is bliss. He also knew at the same time tha=\r\nt bliss is the source of all living creatures, their support during life, a=\r\nnd the goal they have to come back to in the end. Bhagavan also used to say=\r\n in answer to the question =E2=80=98How to become free?=E2=80=99: =E2=80=98=\r\nGo back to the source, out of which you came forth.=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Where=\r\n then is that perfect happiness?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;64 To the seeker of deliverance who=\r\n has perfect non-attachment, Bhagavan tells in what state that happiness dw=\r\nells and by what means it can be won.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;65 The state of deep sleep is =\r\ndear to all creatures, and it is dear because it is happy. But in that stat=\r\ne there are no objects of enjoyment! What can be the source of this sleep-h=\r\nappiness?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;It is supposed by all p=\r\neople that happiness consists of a series of pleasures that come by the con=\r\ntact of external objects through the senses. But deep, dreamless sleep is a=\r\n state of happiness, though there are no objects of enjoyment therein. Ever=\r\nyone describes his sleep experience thus, =E2=80=98I slept happily, but I k=\r\nnew nothing then=E2=80=99.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0So this poses a question, rarely ask=\r\ned, =E2=80=98What is the cause or source of this happiness?=E2=80=99 That t=\r\nhis question needs to be posed and an answer obtained we learn for the firs=\r\nt time from the Guru-sage. Only he can give us the answer, which is set for=\r\nth in the next three verses.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;66 Deep sleep and the supreme state a=\r\nre similar; in both the mind and the world are absent. But in both the mind=\r\n and the world there is the eternal reality, the real Self. It therefore fo=\r\nllows that [the Self] is the cause of the happiness in both of these states=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Human intelligence cannot give this answer, but when this fact i=\r\ns revealed by the Guru, it is at once seen to be true. That the Self does n=\r\not cease to exist, but is present in deep sleep, as in the other states, is=\r\n undeniable, because, as Bhagavan has pointed out, excepting the highly sop=\r\nhisticated but purblind scientists, no one is able to say that he did not e=\r\nxist in sleep. This will be dealt with in detail later. So, we learn that t=\r\nhe real Self, the supreme state, is the source of sleep-happiness.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;It is next revealed that this happiness of the Self is infinite, whereas t=\r\nhe happiness of sleep is nothing when compared to it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;67 The happine=\r\nss of sleep is fitful and meagre, because the mind survives there in seed f=\r\norm. In the supreme state there is infinite bliss, known as ananda in the v=\r\nedantic lore.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The happiness of th=\r\ne mind-free state is perfect. That of sleep is not to be compared to it. To=\r\n distinguish it from the pleasures of worldly life, it is named ananda in t=\r\nhe Upanishads.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It is next shown that even worldly enjoyment=\r\n, though seemingly coming by the contact with objects, really has its sourc=\r\ne in this happiness-nature of the Self.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;68 Only by receiving a minut=\r\ne fraction of that supreme happiness do all the creatures enjoy life in thi=\r\ns abode of the souls. If this source of happiness were not present, who wou=\r\nld care to live in this world for even half a moment?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This is what=\r\n is revealed in the =E2=80=98Ananda Valli=E2=80=99 of the Taittiriya Upanis=\r\nhad, and all the sages have confirmed this fact.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What then is the co=\r\nnclusion? Bhagavan, the Guru, gives the answer:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;69 Hence it follows =\r\nthat to all alike the dearest of all things is the real Self that shines in=\r\n the supreme state as pure bliss. Therefore, to all creatures alike the mos=\r\nt beloved of all is that supreme state, and nothing else.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Since it=\r\n is the happiness of deep sleep that all people love, not the state itself,=\r\n and since that happiness has its source in the real Self of the egoless st=\r\nate, it would be right to conclude that what they really love is that Self,=\r\n and the state in which its true nature is included, though only unknowingl=\r\ny. This is exactly what the Sage Yajnavalkya told his wise wife, Maitreyi, =\r\nin this passage: =E2=80=98Not for the sake of the husband is the husband de=\r\nar, but for the sake of the Self is the husband dear; nor for the sake of t=\r\nhe wife is the wife dear, but for the sake of the Self is the wife dear.=E2=\r\n=80=99 And on to the end of the passage: =E2=80=98Not for the sake of anyth=\r\ning is that thing dear, but for the sake of the Self is anything dear.=E2=\r\n=80=99&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It is due to ignorance of the Self that the love that we be=\r\nar for the Self is mistakenly interpreted as love for something or other. S=\r\no the problem of finding real happiness and escaping from suffering is solv=\r\ned only by becoming aware of the Self as it really is. The teaching is prov=\r\ned by the next passage that concludes with the declaration that the Self is=\r\n all that there is.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;If this teaching is accepted, what then is the=\r\n use of the enquiry about the reality or unreality of the world?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;70 =\r\nFor the aspirant who has thus learned from the sage-Guru that the supreme s=\r\ntate is the home of eternal happiness, and who is therefore indifferent to =\r\nthis world and intent on =E2=80=98winning=E2=80=99 that State, what is the =\r\nuse of any enquiry concerning the world?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;That is explained next.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;71 Let the world be real or otherwise. What is there in it for this a=\r\nspirant to strive for? And let the reality in the supreme state be non-dual=\r\n or otherwise. It is That alone that he wants to win, naught else.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;The two questions, one concerning the reality of the world, the other conc=\r\nerning the non-duality of the real Self, are really one. Both questions bec=\r\nome superfluous for one who has resolved to strive for that state.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;There is also another reason for this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;72 Only by becoming firmly e=\r\nstablished in the real Self of that supreme state can one know definitely w=\r\nhether that reality is non-dual or not. How can anyone become aware of that=\r\n truth while still wandering confusedly in the three states?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Bhaga=\r\nvan gives the following analogy to impress this fact.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D=\r\n&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;73 Just as it is proper to throw away the heap of shorn =\r\nhair without scrutinising it, so it is right for the aspirant to turn away =\r\nfrom the world, which [for him] is of no value, without enquiry concerning =\r\nit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;74 The aspirant will naturally turn away from the world=\r\n at once and, with his mind turned inwards, will strive for the goal. It is=\r\n by turning the mind away from the world that the quest is made, and for th=\r\nat reason the world is certainly to be renounced.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The quest taught=\r\n by the Master implies turning away from the world. The mind has to be turn=\r\ned inwards towards the Self because it dwells within. But this has been sai=\r\nd for the fully ripe aspirant who is not attached to the world. For those w=\r\nho are not yet ripe for the quest, this enquiry is not useless, as will be =\r\nseen presently.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;75 But those who have not the needed strength of n=\r\nonattachment, believing, as they do, that the world is real in its own righ=\r\nt, cannot turn the mind inwards for the quest; so, for them, this enquiry i=\r\ns surely needful.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;76 These, by making the enquiry on the lines ind=\r\nicated by the Master, would become convinced that the world is not real in =\r\nits own right. Then, by reflecting on this truth, they will become able, by=\r\n degrees, to turn their minds inwards.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This knowledge is therefore=\r\n not a mere luxury of speculative philosophy, but is of practical value, as=\r\n shown here. The necessity for guidance by the Master in making this inques=\r\nt on the world is next explained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n77 An enquiry conducted on the b=\r\nasis of worldly experience [alone], by reliance on one=E2=80=99s own [unaid=\r\ned] intelligence, is vain. One should resort to a Guru who is a sage and ma=\r\nke this inquest on the world as guided by him.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font=\r\n-weight:bold&quot;&gt;No enquiry can be made in a vacuum, but only on the basis of =\r\nreliable evidence. Speculative philosophers, as in the West, proceed on the=\r\n false assumption that worldly experience, the offspring of the primary ign=\r\norance, is good enough to be used as evidence for coming to a conclusion on=\r\n a truth that transcends the world. Also, they believe that their intellige=\r\nnce is equal to the task of making a dispassionate enquiry. The knowledge d=\r\nerived from worldly experience is ignorance. Hence, it cannot be used as ev=\r\nidence. If relied on, it will lead to wrong conclusions.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0The re=\r\nason is next given briefly.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;78 Al=\r\nl worldly experience is rooted in ignorance. It is dream-like; it takes pla=\r\nce in worldliness; it pertains to men ignorant [of the real Self]; and it i=\r\ns false. It is therefore no evidence for the seeker of deliverance in [this=\r\n] discrimination between the real and the unreal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It has be=\r\nen explained that the three states of life, waking, dream and sleep, take p=\r\nlace in the profound sleep of ignorance, and hence even waking experience i=\r\ns dreamlike. And this enquiry involves disentangling the real from the unre=\r\nal. Worldly&lt;br&gt;\n\nexperience is at best suspect; its reality is itself in qu=\r\nestion. It is inseparable from the world, whose reality is in question. It =\r\nmust not therefore be assumed to be valid evidence. What then is valid evid=\r\nence?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nSource: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_int=\r\nro.shtml&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.sht=\r\nml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:both;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-botto=\r\nm:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;col=\r\nor:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:87%;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bot=\r\ntom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=\r\n=B0=93=E0=B0=82=C2=A0 =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B=C2=A0 =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=\r\n=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80=C2=\r\n=A0 =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF=C2=A0=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=\r\n=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=C2=A0 =\r\n=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd6c92469f9e3049edb0eef--\r\n\n"}}
