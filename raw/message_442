Krishna clearly says in \nBhagavad Geeta &quot;Follow your own dharma. It=\r\n is dangerous to follow someone \nelse&#39;s dharma&quot;.\n\nFollowing the path of dha=\r\nrma basically means engaging in the right \naction/duty. Right action varies=\r\n from person to person, from time to time \nand from place to place. It is d=\r\nependent on what nature expects from you, \nwhich in turn is based on who yo=\r\nu have been in the past, what actions you \ndid in the past while identifyin=\r\ng with the action, who you affected in the \npast (and how) with the actions=\r\n that you identified with, what debts you \ncreated in the process, and what=\r\n mental tendencies you accumulated until \nnow.\n\nIf, based on one&#39;s mental t=\r\nendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person \nto kill evil persons, th=\r\nat becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s mental \ntendencies and karmic d=\r\nebts, nature wants a person to spread the message of \nuniformity of all rel=\r\nigions, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s \nmental tendencies an=\r\nd karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the \nritual of homam in the=\r\n world, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s \nmental tendencies an=\r\nd karmic debts, nature wants a person to make a lot of \nmoney and construct=\r\n a temple, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.\n\n* * *\n\nThe dharma of a being may cha=\r\nnge from one life to another.\n\nAt the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjun=\r\na&#39;s dharma to kill his gurus, \nelders and relatives. The time then was such=\r\n that there was too much weight \non earth and nature wanted earth to be rel=\r\nieved of some weight. Tremendous \ndestruction was to take place and civiliz=\r\nation destroyed to a great extent, \nto welcome Kali yuga and set the tone f=\r\nor it. Arjuna being a great warrior, \nit was his dharma to facilitate that.=\r\n Some people he deeply loved and \nrespected were on the other side and it w=\r\nas his dharma to kill them.\n\nWhen the same Arjuna was born again in the 19t=\r\nh century as one of \nRamakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Yogananda ha=\r\nd been Arjuna in a \nprevious life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma w=\r\nas different in this \nnew time and place. He was born to renounce material =\r\nlife despite his \naristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a mon=\r\nk and inspire \ngenerations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment an=\r\nd service to \nothers. When he is born again (which he has to, as per what R=\r\namakrishna \nsaid), his dharma based on the time and place may be something =\r\nelse.\n\n* * *\n\nThe tricky question is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s dha=\r\nrma?\n\nSome people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your own =\r\ndharma \nand not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism. Though the =\r\nconcept \nof caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long time, the c=\r\noncept of \ncaste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who liv=\r\ned by \nkilling birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitr=\r\na was a \nkshatrita and a powerful king. He became a brahmana and and a maha=\r\nrshi \nlater. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with the =\r\nvarna \nof father, because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As o=\r\nne \ndevelops in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one does.\n\nThu=\r\ns, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to know your \nd=\r\nharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas in \n=\r\nthe world. Each person has individual dharma.\n\nKnowing what one&#39;s dharma is=\r\n is very very very difficult. If one is pure \nenough, one will *know* one&#39;s=\r\n dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our \nmind that tells us what our=\r\n dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of \nnoise from other parts of our=\r\n minds which tell other things. Thus, we get \nconfused.\n\nWe should make the=\r\n best judgment combining discrimination and intuition and \ndecide what is o=\r\nur dharma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, but doing \nthe best we ca=\r\nn is all that we can do!\n\nMore than following dharma, what is of utmost imp=\r\nortance is to engage in \nactions without identification. *That* alone ensur=\r\nes that we are not \naccumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. =\r\nWe should not build \ntoo much attachment to what we are doing. We should en=\r\ngage in the best \npossible actions (based on our best judgment on what our =\r\ndharma in the given \nsituation is), with as little attachment and self-iden=\r\ntification with the \naction as possible. When the action is finished, we sh=\r\nould leave the result \nto god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will h=\r\nappen now&quot;, &quot;will it \nwork&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unf=\r\nication through \nuntached action) will simplify our ego and purify our cons=\r\nciousness slowly. \nAs we become purer, our mind will work sharper and tell =\r\nour dharma clearer. \nThere is a positive feedback here. This will slowly en=\r\nable us to see our \ndharma clearly and follow it without incurring new karm=\r\nas. This is not easy, \nbut not as difficult as people think.\n\nThe bottomlin=\r\ne is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense of \n&quot;this is m=\r\ny dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one engages in action with \nlittle atta=\r\nchment.\n\n* * *\n\nIn deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are=\r\n the inputs. \nAnother external input is the words of scriptures and learned=\r\n men. One can \nderive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place is given to o=\r\nne&#39;s spiritual \nmaster. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can ta=\r\nke the words of \nthe master to determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincere=\r\nly.\n\nWhen Arjuna was confused about what his dharma was and thought killing=\r\n gurus \nand relatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarifie=\r\nd his \ndharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his=\r\n dharma \nand wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do =\r\nsadhana, \nRamakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in t=\r\nhe material \nworld and do the work of Mother for him.\n\nOne who is not in tu=\r\nne with nature and does not know who one is, what one&#39;s \ndebts are and what=\r\n nature expects from one can err in the judgment of what \none&#39;s dharma is. =\r\nIf one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight into \none&#39;s inner co=\r\nre, such a guru can give perfect guidance.\n\n* * *\n\nBottomline is that I (or=\r\n anybody) cannot outline a set of principles and \ndeclare that as the dharm=\r\na. No, dharma changes from person to person, from \ntime to time and from pl=\r\nace to place. Also, there are no thumbrules to find \nout what one&#39;s dharma =\r\nis. But, one can refine one&#39;s understanding of one&#39;s \ndharma by increasing =\r\ninternal purity. By doing various kinds of spiritual \nsadhana (like homam, =\r\njapam etc) and engaging in actions without much \nattachment, one can slowly=\r\n purify oneself and refine one&#39;s understanding of \none&#39;s individual dharma.=\r\n\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/=\r\n homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana=\r\n\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish l=\r\nessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (W=\r\nindows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website=\r\n: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- - \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;d=\r\nahiyajiten@ yahoo.co. in&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\nSent: Saturd=\r\nay, September 27, 2008 8:02 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Dharma\n\n&gt; Namaste to=\r\n all\n&gt;\n&gt; i just finished my Aghora series\n&gt; and in it in last part\n&gt; Vimala=\r\nnda says path of dharma is very personal.\n&gt; Can somebody share views on tha=\r\nt and how can we approach\n&gt; towards it\n&gt; Does it has to do something with v=\r\nedas and upanishads\n&gt;\n&gt; regards\n&gt; jitender\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Did you k=\r\nnow?

When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused =\r\nabout his dharma &lt;BR&gt;and wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded =\r\nplace to do sadhana, &lt;BR&gt;Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon h=\r\nim to stay in the material &lt;BR&gt;world and do the work of Mother for him.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;One who is not in tune with nature and does not know who one is, what o=\r\nne&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;debts are and what nature expects from one can err in the judgment=\r\n of what &lt;BR&gt;one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clea=\r\nr insight into &lt;BR&gt;one&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give perfect guidance.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bottomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set=\r\n of principles and &lt;BR&gt;declare that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from =\r\nperson to person, from &lt;BR&gt;time to time and from place to place. Also, ther=\r\ne are no thumbrules to find\n &lt;BR&gt;out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can ref=\r\nine one&#39;s understanding of one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;dharma by increasing internal purity. =\r\nBy doing various kinds of spiritual &lt;BR&gt;sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and=\r\n engaging in actions without much &lt;BR&gt;attachment, one can slowly purify one=\r\nself and refine one&#39;s understanding of &lt;BR&gt;one&#39;s individual dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nBest regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.ved=\r\nicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst =\r\nrologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www=\r\n.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.Ved=\r\nicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.ya=\r\nhoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. y=\r\nahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D=\r\n&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot;\n target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http:=\r\n//vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A =\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;htt=\r\np://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A =\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http:/=\r\n/www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n------- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;From: &quot;dahiyaj=\r\niten&quot; &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:dahiyajiten%40yahoo.co.in&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;dahiyajiten@ yahoo.co. in&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To: &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:=\r\nvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom=\r\n@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sent: Saturday, September 27, 2008 8:02 AM&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Dharma&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste to all&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\ni just finished my Aghora series&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and in it in last part&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Vim=\r\nalanda says path of dharma is very personal.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Can\n somebody share vi=\r\news on that and how can we approach&lt;BR&gt;&gt; towards it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Does it has =\r\nto do something with vedas and upanishads&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; j=\r\nitender&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n    =\r\n  &lt;!--2--&gt;&lt;hr size=3D1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; Did you know?
