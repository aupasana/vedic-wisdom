Any ways, It is matter of finding out by one&#39;s own experiences (an=\r\nd that is actually the only way)rather than relying on experiences of other=\r\ns. This is also opinion of Mihir and Narasimha Garu. unless ofcourse one ha=\r\ns a spiritual Guru and full faith in Guru to just blindly perform the Sadha=\r\nna commanded by Guru. for such person it is fine not to roam around.\n\nMediu=\r\nm used in Sudarshan Kriya is Air (on gross level atleast) while that in Hom=\r\nam/Havan is Fire and it is only logical to think that there must lie some d=\r\nifferences in terms of speed/quality/effects in their respective evolutiona=\r\nry curves and as far as I am concerned, I have probably had some knwoeldge =\r\nof differences using Air and Fire. I can see that Mihir&#39;s experience of SK =\r\nis somewhat similar to mine. It&#39;ll be interesting to note here that I did p=\r\nerform a couple of havans with the inspiration of AOL and that was Mahamrit=\r\nunjaya Havan, back in 2006 (before i started Havan regularly in 2008 with t=\r\nhe divine inspiration of Narasimha).\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n--- In vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste =\r\nVinayak,\n&gt; \n&gt; [you are the one of the 4\n&gt; &gt; prominent people who have influ=\r\nenced & inspired me on spiritual path]\n&gt; \n&gt; I am sure the 2nd important per=\r\nson is me :)\n&gt; Jokes apart, let me share a little bit of my personal backgr=\r\nound on Sudrashan Kriya and Homa as i have done both practices.\n&gt; \n&gt; I lear=\r\nnt SK in 2005 and then almost daily kept doing it till 2008 mid. I also lea=\r\nrnt advance course as well as Padmasadhana (PS) from AOL in 2006. I also re=\r\ngularly kept doing PS ALMOST everyday. For about 3 years, I used to do SK a=\r\nnd PS regularly. \n&gt; \n&gt; Now I got started with Homa on daily basis since 200=\r\n8 Sept and keep doing it till date (with few breaks/irregularities at times=\r\n) and since then I have stopped SK, however sometime do PS as i enjoy that =\r\nsystematic Yogaasanas.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just gave above background which may help to as=\r\nsess.\n&gt; ***\n&gt; SK and PS helped me cure some physical chronic issues which t=\r\nroubled me since childhood and were helpful to strengthen my will power. It=\r\n generated an inner attitude to sustain any problems or calamities life may=\r\n throw by making my mind generally calmer then it used to be. I am able to =\r\nsay that because I actually faced deep crises in 2006 July to sept and I wa=\r\ns still more or less unperturbed and could handle the situation. i increasi=\r\nngly become philosophical in my attitude.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now I started Chandi paath a=\r\nnd Havan combination in 2008. if i now sit back and look at things then i c=\r\nan see some striking differences. Havan and CP combination striked at my em=\r\notional aspect. In the past, i was hardly tested on Emotional/Relational is=\r\nsues in general with society. i hardly faced any trouble in that area. Howe=\r\nver, when I started Havan and CP, it looks that it badly attacked this aspe=\r\nct of my being and I was severely tested. in Short, My public relations whi=\r\nch used to be always excellent (naturally) started falling apart. It shook =\r\nme up very badly as it never happened in the past and I did not have enough=\r\n experience, knowledge to handle such things. severe EQ testing then surfac=\r\ned other weaknesses which i felt that i never had :-). it amazed me at one =\r\nside while at the same time It threw a formidable challenge to my so called=\r\n **ballooned spiritual ego**. All these happening were more inside and much=\r\n less tangible outside. There are crises i went through in my job which als=\r\no tested me a lot. I lost a good some of money in a cheating case within 6 =\r\nmonths of starting Havan. however, fortunately I intuitionally realised tha=\r\nt Mother is removing bad karmas using Pavaka and I steadfastly kept doing H=\r\navan in the midst of all these emotional, financial, career, family trouble=\r\ns and now it seems as if the dust have been settled more or less. quite pea=\r\nceful with myself after seeing Stars in the bright Sunny day ;-)\n&gt; \n&gt; ***\n&gt;=\r\n So if now i compare it, the peace of mind and will power given by SK and P=\r\nS was a surface one. They never created a situation where in i was ruthless=\r\nly tested on my weaknesses. So i would say that they are spiritual practice=\r\ns which worked quite slowly and quite easily without disturbing me. While C=\r\nP and Homam actually turned me on my head. It started giving me a real kind=\r\n of Detachment, wisdom. Few vital things have become much clearer now.\n&gt; **=\r\n*\n&gt; Please note that these are my personal experiences and others can have =\r\nentirely different experiences. there are many variables in this. i just tr=\r\nied to state my own experiences for whatever worth they may be. Please also=\r\n note that Havan Sadhana does not necessarily throw throubles in life of pe=\r\nople. It all depends upon Past Samskaars of individuals. we&#39;ll not know suc=\r\nh things.\n&gt; ***\n&gt; Please forgive me to almost always write personal things =\r\nbecause I like to write the things which i have gone through myself.\n&gt; \n&gt; J=\r\nay Bhavaani!\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, vinay=\r\nak tandle &lt;vinayakmechie@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Guruji,\n&gt; &gt; I consider yo=\r\nu as my Guru as you are the one of the 4\n&gt; &gt; prominent people who have infl=\r\nuenced & inspired me on spiritual path(whatever\n&gt; &gt; little I do) & I find y=\r\nour explanations\n&gt; &gt; very very convincing.
