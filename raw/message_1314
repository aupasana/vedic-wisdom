Someone sent me a few snippets fro=\r\nm an \n                    interview posted on her website. Please see below=\r\n.\n\n                    It is interesting that she considers Ramakrishna Par=\r\namahamsa as her guru. It \n                    is interesting that Ramakrish=\r\nna told her she had to &quot;do fire ceremonies and \n                    show wh=\r\nat is truth&quot; and &quot;at that time the whole world will be peace&quot;. This \n      =\r\n              is similar to what my guru was told by Divine Mother when she=\r\n appeared to \n                    him during Shata Chandi homam at Chennai.=\r\n\n\n                    She told him that many people are and will be born wh=\r\no will perform a short \n                    fire ritual on a regular basis,=\r\n establish sanatana dharma and peace in the \n                    world and =\r\nalso make quick spiritual progress individually in that process. \n         =\r\n           Shree Maa&#39;s statement about what Ramakrishna told her is along s=\r\nimilar \n                    lines.\n\n                    My guru was also to=\r\nld by Mother that a few centres of regular Chandi homam \n                  =\r\n  should be established around the world, where Chandi homam is done 3 time=\r\ns a \n                    day. These places do not need to be near any templ=\r\nes or famous places and \n                    can be anywhere. The ritual ne=\r\ned not be elaborate. For example, there is no \n                    need to =\r\noffer silk sarees etc in fire. A simple ritual with bare minimum \n         =\r\n           offerings is enough, but it needs to be performed 3 times everyd=\r\nay. When a \n                    few such centres are established, it will a=\r\npparently lead to a chain of \n                    events that will help re-=\r\nestablish sanatana dharma.\n\n                    Though not 3 times a day, t=\r\nhese people have done a Chandi homam everyday for \n                    3 ye=\r\nars in the same place and finished 1000 such homas. That is fantastic! \n   =\r\n                 It is the sadhana and purity of sadhakas that creates ener=\r\ngy and brings \n                    deities to a place. While several ancien=\r\nt temples are without any divine \n                    presence these days, =\r\nnew places of divine presence may be created by pure \n                    s=\r\nouls engaged in selfless sadhana for establishing dharma in the world.\n\n   =\r\n                 As I mentioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Shata Chandi h=\r\nomam during which \n                    Mother appeared and gave instruction=\r\ns to my guru on spreading homam was \n                    taken on Ramakrish=\r\nna&#39; s birth anniversary and the time of sankalpa was within \n              =\r\n      a few minutes from the actual Tithi Pravesha time of the birth annive=\r\nrsary. \n                    All of this was a coincidence and we were unawa=\r\nre of this significance when \n                    we decided the muhurta. I=\r\nt is interesting to know that Ramakrishna did \n                    mention =\r\nfire ceremonies specifically to somebody and that his words are \n          =\r\n          similar to the words of Mother.\n\n                    Best regards=\r\n,\n                    Narasimha\n                    ------------ --------- =\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- -\n                    Do a Short Ho=\r\nmam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n                    Do=\r\n Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n        =\r\n            Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n   =\r\n                 Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcas=\r\nt. net\n                    Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAst rologer.org\n                    Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: ht=\r\ntp://www.SriJagan nath.org\n                    ------------ --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- - \n\n                    &gt;

Please see below.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is interesting \n                    that s=\r\nhe considers Ramakrishna Paramahamsa as her guru. It \n                    &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;is interesting that Ramakrishna told her she had to &quot;do \n               =\r\n     fire ceremonies and &lt;BR&gt;show what is truth&quot; and &quot;at that \n            =\r\n        time the whole world will be peace&quot;. This &lt;BR&gt;is similar to \n      =\r\n              what my guru was told by Divine Mother when she appeared to \n=\r\n                    &lt;BR&gt;him during Shata Chandi homam at Chennai.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sh=\r\ne \n                    told him that many people are and will be born who w=\r\nill \n                    perform a short &lt;BR&gt;fire ritual on a regular basis=\r\n, \n                    establish sanatana dharma and peace in the &lt;BR&gt;world=\r\n and \n                    also make quick spiritual progress individually i=\r\nn that \n                    process. &lt;BR&gt;Shree Maa&#39;s statement about what R=\r\namakrishna \n                    told her is along similar &lt;BR&gt;lines.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;My guru was also \n                    told by Mother that a few centres of=\r\n regular Chandi homam \n                    &lt;BR&gt;should be established around=\r\n the world, where Chandi \n                    homam is done 3 times a &lt;BR&gt;d=\r\nay. These places do not need to \n                    be near any temples or=\r\n famous places and &lt;BR&gt;can be \n                    anywhere. The ritual nee=\r\nd not be elaborate. For example, \n                    there is no &lt;BR&gt;need =\r\nto offer silk sarees etc in fire. A \n                    simple ritual with=\r\n bare minimum &lt;BR&gt;offerings is enough, but \n                    it needs to=\r\n be performed 3 times everyday. When a &lt;BR&gt;few \n                    such ce=\r\nntres are established, it will apparently lead to a \n                    ch=\r\nain of &lt;BR&gt;events that will help re-establish sanatana \n                   =\r\n dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Though not 3 times a day, these people have \n              =\r\n      done a Chandi homam everyday for &lt;BR&gt;3 years in the same \n           =\r\n         place and finished 1000 such homas. That is fantastic! \n          =\r\n          &lt;BR&gt;It is the sadhana and purity of sadhakas that creates \n      =\r\n              energy and brings &lt;BR&gt;deities to a place. While several \n    =\r\n                ancient temples are without any divine &lt;BR&gt;presence these \n=\r\n                    days, new places of divine presence may be created by p=\r\nure \n                    &lt;BR&gt;souls engaged in selfless sadhana for establis=\r\nhing \n                    dharma in the world.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As I mentioned earlie=\r\nr, the \n                    sankalpa of the Shata Chandi homam during which=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;Mother \n                    appeared and gave instructions to my guru =\r\non spreading homam \n                    was &lt;BR&gt;taken on Ramakrishna&#39; s bir=\r\nth anniversary and the \n                    time of sankalpa was within &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;a few minutes from the \n                    actual Tithi Pravesha time of =\r\nthe birth anniversary. &lt;BR&gt;All \n                    of this was a coinciden=\r\nce and we were unaware of this \n                    significance when &lt;BR&gt;w=\r\ne decided the muhurta. It is \n                    interesting to know that =\r\nRamakrishna did &lt;BR&gt;mention fire \n                    ceremonies specifical=\r\nly to somebody and that his words are \n                    &lt;BR&gt;similar to t=\r\nhe words of Mother.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best \n                    regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;------------ --------- --------- \n                    --------- --------=\r\n- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam \n                    Yourself: &lt;A href=3D=\r\n&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot;
