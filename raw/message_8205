Since she has no experience she w=\r\nill need help so I was wondering can I take a metallic spoon or something t=\r\no help the fire from going out? Any tips how can I help?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Another qu=\r\nestion that arises in my mind is, is it too early for me to teach homam.  H=\r\nomam requires one to be brahmachari. Due to hormonal issues teens start exp=\r\neriencing sexual thoughts and varied emotions. Having a kid control her emo=\r\ntions at such an early age is it really right on my part? Will I be putting=\r\n pressure on them .....shouldn&#39;t they experience the life in fullest form b=\r\nefore endeavouring the path of spirituality.  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Experienced parents =\r\nkindly advice me? \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Advance thanks for every help,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Priya\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
