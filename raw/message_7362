I would often forget the fi=\r\nrst word of a verse and\n&gt; &gt; Bhagavan would help me. Then writing down the f=\r\nirst word of each verse of\n&gt; &gt; Dakshinamurti Stotra, Bhagavan gave me the s=\r\nlip of paper to help remember\n&gt; &gt; the sequence.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On the first of eac=\r\nh Tamil month I would go round the Hill along with my\n&gt; &gt; mother, and on th=\r\ne way we would walk into the Ashram to pay homage to\n&gt; &gt; Bhagavan who would=\r\n receive us with a smile and sometimes ask us to take\n&gt; &gt; breakfast. Once, =\r\nwhen as usual two iddlies were served on my plate, I\n&gt; asked\n&gt; &gt; for one mo=\r\nre.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bhagavan turned to me and said that I could have one more after=\r\n eating\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; two. When I had finished eating them, Bhagavan asked whet=\r\nher I would like\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; have more, and I replied No. Bhagavan, said with =\r\na smile: Why did you ask\n&gt; &gt; for more even before starting to eat?
