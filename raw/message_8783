&lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste all,\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;They way of a pilgrim&quot; is very interesting book tha=\r\nt I have just started to read. It&#39;s about a man who succeeds in constant re=\r\nmemberance of God.\n&gt; \n&gt; In a nutshell, it&#39;s an (annonymous) autobiography o=\r\nf an average man from 19th century Russia who began to repeat a Christian &#39;=\r\nmantra&#39; called the Jesus prayer...&quot;Lord Jesus Christ have mercy on me a sin=\r\nner&quot;...day in and day out (after his wife died and he was drawn to the spir=\r\nitual path). And slowly he explains how the mantra began to repeat itself c=\r\nonstantly in his mind without him having to do anything. He solves the prob=\r\nlems of mind-wandering and attains\n&gt; one-pointedness, and various spiritual=\r\n truths are slowly revealed to him.\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, is there anyone on the=\r\n forum who has actually experienced this state? If yes, please can you advi=\r\nse how you got there? How did you overcome obstacles such as laziness, bore=\r\ndom, forgetfullness, mind-wandering etc? It would be inspiring to hear your=\r\n experiences. Reading stories of highly exalted God realised beings is fine=\r\n, but it&#39;s difficult to relate to them (they seem so far advanced). It some=\r\ntimes helps to hear from someone who was just like you, and how they worked=\r\n on themselves.\n&gt; \n&gt; Coming back to the book, in the first chapter, he is a=\r\n &#39;spiritual baby&#39; just starting out on the path and completely ignorant (wa=\r\ns an ordinary householder, but then wife died and his house burnt down and =\r\nhe became poor) He reads in the Bible &quot;pray unceasingly&quot; and becomes fascin=\r\nated with this idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; He meets a Guru (an elderly monk) and said &quot;I wan=\r\nt to pray unceasingly but I don&#39;t know how&quot;. Guru taught him the Jesus pray=\r\ner and said do 3000 repetions a day of the prayer for one week, 6000 a day =\r\nthe week after, and 12000 a day the week after that! After 12000 repetition=\r\ns a day, he says his tongue felt a bit numb, and his wrist/thumb were hurti=\r\nng a little from counting the beads on his\n&gt; rosary! But he followed his Gu=\r\nru&#39;s instructions fully.\n&gt; \n&gt; Later the Guru said, well done...now it&#39;s tim=\r\ne to repeat this prayer all the time, keeping other thoughts away as much a=\r\ns possible! How is this possible asks the student (as many of us may also a=\r\nsk). The Guru said just try. He tries, and succeeds. Quite inspiring.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nFor anyone who&#39;s interesting in glancing through a few chapters, a preview =\r\nis available on google books.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3DPsQ=\r\n7zEi9AGsC&source=3Dgbs_book_similarbooks\n&gt; \n&gt; Here is a summary of the seek=\r\ner on wikipedia\n&gt; \n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Way_of_a_Pilgrim\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Om Namo Narayanaya\n&gt; \n&gt; Aparna\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
