Th=\r\nere is an small but interesting incident in the Ramayana which illustrates =\r\nwhat I was trying to say.\n\n\nAt the appointed hour, it was time for Rama to =\r\ndie. But the god of death \ncould not enter Rama&#39;s city as Hanumana with his=\r\n yogic prowess guarded \nthe gates of the city. Hanumana loved Rama so much =\r\nthat he did not want \nRama to die. To distract Hanumana and let Nature take=\r\n its course, Rama \ndropped his ring through a crack in the floor and asked =\r\nHanumana to go \nand fetch it. The crack led Hanumana to the subterranean re=\r\nalm where he \nfound countless number of exactly similar looking rings. Vasu=\r\nki, the \nserpent-king, and guarding of the subterranean realm explained, \n&quot;=\r\nWhenever a ring falls here, a Hanumana follows it and we know it is \ntime f=\r\nor a Rama to leave his body. Such rings have fallen from above as \nlong as =\r\nI can remember, and will continue to do so in future. As long as the wheel =\r\nof existence rotates, old worlds die and new ones are reborn. In each such =\r\nworld there will be a Hanumana, a Rama and a Rama&#39;s ring.&quot;\n\n\n-Regards\n=C2=\r\n=A0Rajarshi\n\n\nawaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |\nparam bhAwama=\r\njAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n\n\n________________________________\n Fr=\r\nom: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \nS=\r\nent: Monday, 30 July 2012 8:16 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: To those who =\r\nsay that they don=E2=80=99t believe in any religion\n \n\n=C2=A0 \nDear Rajarsh=\r\ni,\n=C2=A0\n&lt;&lt;I do not believe in Moksha.

I am doing fine=\r\n and I hope you are doing fine too. \n\nDisagreements and difference of view-=\r\npoints are absolutely fine, afterall in ancient India from the monotheists =\r\nto the atheists, we had every breed coexisting. Having said that, I will ex=\r\nplain a few of the points you have raised in your email, from my perspectiv=\r\ne of course. \n\n\n\n&lt;&lt; You have to complete the story.&gt;. \n\n\nThe reason I canno=\r\nt add anything more to it is because the individual himself did not reveal =\r\nanything more about this.=C2=A0 For me, the incidents he revealed hold an i=\r\nnteresting view-point and a value on its own . When I mention any such stor=\r\ny I only narrate the same exactly as it is, without adding=C2=A0 or subtrac=\r\nting anything from it. Conclusions, whatever they maybe, have to be drawn b=\r\ny every individual. Some may reject it, some may accept it, both of which a=\r\nre fine. \n\n\n&lt;&lt; This story seems to like I used=C2=A0 to read in Chandamama.=\r\n This guy Iyengar seems to be a siddha if the=C2=A0 story so far is true.an=\r\nd he has the ability to shape shift and transportation. So what?? But he st=\r\nill needs his daily fix of bhang.&gt;&gt; \n\nAs per the Tantric scriptures, even L=\r\nord Shiva in his form of Bhairava smokes ganja, drinks alcohol, eats with d=\r\nogs and chandalas, roams around naked in the smashana. So is taking intoxic=\r\nants a sufficient criteria to judge anyone&#39;s spirituality? Not for me! \n\n, =\r\n\n\n&lt;&lt;what does God mean in this tale? &gt;&gt; \n\n\nI will tell you how I see it. In=\r\n this story, God means infinity. Now what is infinity? It cannot be describ=\r\ned, it cannot be named, it cannot be understood using the five sense organs=\r\n. Science does not understand infinity, art does not understand infinity, n=\r\nothing or nobody=C2=A0 understands infinity. It is a summation of all that =\r\nwe know, all that we can=C2=A0 imagine and all that is impossible for us to=\r\n imagine. It is an incomprehensible force that runs through everything, fro=\r\nm the most loveable to the most despicable , from the most holy to the most=\r\n unholy, from the greatest saint to the stupidest piece of rock at the bott=\r\nom of the deepest ocean in the farthest planet in the farthest solar system=\r\n in the farthest universe. \n\n\n\nNow question is, can an average human being =\r\n&quot;know&quot; this mysterious and all pervading force? Knowing implies understandi=\r\nng. Clearly no. Then how does one interact with such a thing? One way is to=\r\n consider everything, and I mean EVERYTHING from living to non-living, as a=\r\n manifestation of that force and thus learn to love the same unconditionall=\r\ny without expecting anything in return. No wonder such unconditional love i=\r\ns not easy. It needs tremendous effort to change our own conditioning of th=\r\ne mind, and work on our inherent biases and prejudices. That is what the=C2=\r\n=A0 aim of sadhana is, in my view. To work on oneself, to make one ready to=\r\n be able to unconditionally love everything. The greater number of entities=\r\n one can love unconditionally, that much little bit closer one can come to =\r\ninteracting with the truly infinite. And those few rare human beings who ca=\r\nn love a whole universe unconditionally, are possibly the closest to this s=\r\nupreme and unknowable force.\n In common language, we call them Rishis. \n\nI =\r\nlike all forms of Deities, for I find something beautiful in everyone of th=\r\nem. And I also like the One behind forms, which is so perfectly transcenden=\r\ntal that it cannot be comprehended ever. It&#39;s like the surface area of the =\r\nfine tip of a needle, or the gap between the two breaths, or the millionth =\r\npart of a single hair, or the endless-ness of space, or the bottomless well=\r\n of stillness in the mind at certain points in meditation. The only thing t=\r\nhat stops me from getting a better understanding the grandeur of=C2=A0 this=\r\n formless entity are the limitations of my own mind and body, that I have a=\r\ncquired over millions of births. That is why Sadhana. To slowly gnaw away a=\r\nt my own mind, to be better able to appreciate this endless, nameless entit=\r\ny. G_d. \n\n\nI do not believe in Moksha. What is Moksha? No rebirth? If the U=\r\nniverse itself gets born over and over and over, if Rama and Krshna come ba=\r\nck at every cycle, who am I to demand that I should not get born? Infact, w=\r\nhen a person proverbially finishes off his/her karmas, they merely go to an=\r\nother plane in this Universe and stay there for eons of time, since time an=\r\nyway moves very, very slowly in different realms. But then, if this force s=\r\no wants, it can send back any of the souls from any of the realms to any of=\r\n the other realms to serve a certain function. And if a soul stays in a cer=\r\ntain higher realm and in forced to take rebirth again, the seeds of the kar=\r\nmas - which never really die off - are=C2=A0 watered again by the environme=\r\nnt of birth and they sprout into saplings. And this may go even beyond one =\r\ncycle of creation. Else why would Krshna and Arjuna fight the very same ene=\r\nmies that they had been fighting in the past cycle of creation? Mahabharata=\r\n says\n so. I believe it. \n\n\n\nWhat then is the final aim of all this, spirit=\r\nuality etc? I don&#39;t know. Maybe, to teach us to broaden our perspectives an=\r\nd consequentially lessen our attachments to our otherwise mundane lives and=\r\n its mundane problems. This is like a circular roller-coaster ride we see i=\r\nn local melas. Tighten the seat-belts, bring a smile in the heart, be detac=\r\nhed and enjoy the show! \n\n\nBest of luck and take good care of yourself! \n\n\n=\r\n-Regards \n=C2=A0Rajarshi \n\n\n\nawaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah =\r\n| \nparam bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24] \n\n\n___________________=\r\n________________\n\nFrom: Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt; \nTo: &quot;ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;=C2=A0 &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \nSent: Sat=\r\nurday, 28 July 2012 7:30 PM \nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] To those who say t=\r\nhat they don=E2=80=99t believe in any religion \n\n=C2=A0 Dear Rajarshi Bhai,=\r\n \nHow are you?

When=\r\n you wrote back suddenly my fear about Her melted away and I did immediate =\r\nprayers to Her. Thanks. \n\n\nThe other thing is can I dare to say that I do n=\r\not agree what is in this thread. Why does this so called spiritual man has =\r\nto dump his failure on=C2=A0 religion. If people do not believe in religion=\r\n or God or afterlife, it is their problem. We are not all equal. We all do =\r\nnot come from same stock. We are born with different conditions, go through=\r\n different life experiences and go where our fate or destiny takes us. This=\r\n world is composed of 3 gunas and there is always going to tension of diffe=\r\nrent sort. Why=C2=A0 blame it on religion or God, why not on greed and desi=\r\nre to control others and lord over them using what ever mean. \n\n\nThis story=\r\n seems to like I used to read in Chandamama. This guy Iyengar seems to be a=\r\n siddha if the story so far is true.and he has the ability to shape shift a=\r\nnd transportation. So what??

Is it Creator God or Divine Lord Of Sri Vr=\r\nindavan or=C2=A0=C2=A0 Divine=C2=A0 Mother or=C2=A0 Self Realisation or Uni=\r\nversal God or Jewish God or Formless God or Fire God?? After all there was =\r\na dhoni fire there? Or some other God ?? \n\n\nSri Vrindavan has a rolling pop=\r\nulation. They are not in confusion. Many people come there only for curiosi=\r\nty, many other come only for Darshan in the Temple and go back home happy. =\r\nmany others come with different desires. It is very wrong to expect from a =\r\nperson who is in fifth grade to have knowledge of 15th grade. \n\n\nMany times=\r\n people go to temple to pray and ask for certain things and if it does not =\r\nhappen they become very anti religion and anti God. So what?? It has nothin=\r\ng to do with me or you or anybody else. It is their life. \n\n\nI was very ver=\r\ny very ill. Nobody was helping me. Many people were giving me lot of pain.=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 I went=C2=A0 from Religious place to religious place, temple t=\r\no temple, holy man to holy man. Nothing seem to worked. Then I took up reli=\r\ngious practise of doing mantra japa and other things which are in scripture=\r\ns and Grace of Divine Mother it worked. It is totally religious discipline =\r\naccording to our scriptures. \n\n\nDo you drive a car? Did you pass you exam f=\r\nirst time? I do not drive a car. It will take me several exams to pass it. =\r\nMany people pass their test first time and drive successfully. Does it mean=\r\n I should blame car or exams or examiner or road for my failure??? .Many pe=\r\nople take up spiritual life and if they do not find success quickly they bl=\r\name religion and God. \n\n\nI also used to think that a real experience of God=\r\n would be very powerful thing. but there are other aspects to it. If=C2=A0 =\r\nsomeone is totally=C2=A0 dependent on Divine Mother and calls on Her day an=\r\nd night, but yet he is not ready for certain energy or his body is not clea=\r\nn enough to receive a new light, then Divine Mother would appear to him in =\r\nvery gentle way to comfort him and to console so that he remains on the pat=\r\nh. She will appear right in front of him but he only sees the Golden Aura a=\r\nnd not what is middle of it because he is not yet ready. Whenever I think o=\r\nf that moment I am filled with deep bliss and joy and wonderment. \n\n\nYou ar=\r\ne a special person doing everyday intense haven to spread the light.Many ot=\r\nher people in this group are doing haven everyday to fill their life with l=\r\night of Divine Beings. This is a complete religious method which is also to=\r\ntally spiritual thing.Please do not get impressed with pseudo spiritual tal=\r\nk and tales of shape shifting. Is everything alright in your everyday life =\r\nbecause I felt a sadness in your mail? I am sure I am very wrong in=C2=A0 t=\r\nhis. \n\n\nFew days ago Olympic flame passed right outside my road.I did not g=\r\no out to see it.

Lately I realized this is literally=\r\n true. Heavy psychological constructs are created by religions to protect a=\r\nn average person from the real experience of God, which is so powerful and =\r\noverwhelming that if and when it happens, it can effectively cause a hurric=\r\nane in your average life and pretty much destroy all your well laid plans. =\r\n\n\n\n\nI will briefly narrate a true and interesting incident. \n\n\n\nAn individu=\r\nal - say X - had gone to Vrindavan to=C2=A0 stay there for some=C2=A0 years=\r\n. He was sitting at a satsang of a famous sadhu, enjoying the discourse, wh=\r\nen a ragged looking man, with piercing unblinking eyes, comes over and asks=\r\n for food. The sadhu who was lecturing at the satsang, stopped and ordered =\r\nsomeone to bring some sweets for the ragged looking man. Then he did a pran=\r\nam to the man and said, &quot;Maharaj, please tell us some words of God&quot;. The ma=\r\nn became angry, and retorted back, &quot;Why? Why waste time talking of God, no =\r\none wants God anyway. If God comes, all will run away. So please continue w=\r\nith your lectures as you were doing before I came in&quot;. Everyone became unco=\r\nmfortably silent hearing this. Meanwhile the sweets came, the man took a sw=\r\neet into his mouth, looked up at the sky and then got up and started walkin=\r\ng off. After he went out, the Sadhu who was lecturing, looked at his follow=\r\ners and said, &quot;He is a sadhu who comes to Vrindavan once in a\n while, but h=\r\ne has probably lost his mental balance due to smoking too much=C2=A0 ganja&quot;=\r\n. Now X, who was sitting there, for some weird reason felt attracted to tha=\r\nt ragged man and went out to see where the guy was going. As he approached =\r\nthe ragged looking man, the man turned around and spoke to X in clear Engli=\r\nsh, &quot;Hello, I was waiting for you to come and join me.&quot; X was of course tak=\r\nen aback, did not expect the man to speak in English and more over he had n=\r\no clue how the man got to know that he knew English (X was dressed in the g=\r\narb of a sadhu - saffron clothes). \n\n\n\nThe man continued, &quot;My name is Mr Iy=\r\nengar. I was born near Chennai, was an Engineer by profession, but left hom=\r\ne long back and have been a wondering sadhu since then.&quot; X asked him, why d=\r\nid you derive the sadhu who was doing the satsang? Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;All=\r\n this is bogus. Actually this God thing itself is source of all confusion. =\r\nNo one has a clue. Not the hordes of Sadhus, not ordinary folks, really no =\r\none. And God is the reason for all=C2=A0 the religious troubles and other n=\r\nonsense.&quot; X felt a little irritated, &quot;Why do you have so much bitterness ab=\r\nout religion/God/sadhus etc? If you have been a sadhu for long, then how co=\r\nme you haven&#39;t met a single genuine sadhu yet, how is it possible?&quot;. Mr Iye=\r\nngar replied, &quot;Well if I take Vrindavan alone, there is only one genuine ma=\r\nn here, rest are all as confused as anybody else, merely different degrees =\r\nof confusion. But you cannot meet that man, he is not accessible to others.=\r\n&quot; Mr Iyengar continued, &quot;The root of\n all this problem is this God business=\r\n. Know it for certain, that man cannot know God ever. What is infinite is b=\r\neyond the capacity of the human brain to comprehend. At best a man will onl=\r\ny imagine a magnified man or a magnified woman with super-powers. If the in=\r\ndividual keeps doing sadhana, one day he will create this form by a project=\r\nion of his own mind, and he may even acquire supernatural abilities from th=\r\nis form, and generally be regarded=C2=A0 by others as a man of god. But God=\r\n is beyond this. That is why I say the root of the problem is trying to und=\r\nerstand the infinite with a finite mind and then stressing that one has und=\r\nerstood correctly.&quot; While talking, the sadhu stopped at a small tea-stall a=\r\nnd bought some ganja, and in one pull finished off the chillum. Then held t=\r\nhe smoke in a kumbaka for about 5 minutes, slowly releasing the smoke in sm=\r\nall bits. Then he continued, &quot;You (meaning X) are a young man. Have a clear=\r\n mind in your head, don&#39;t get\n confused by all these show of spirituality y=\r\nou see in holy places. When I was your age, I did a lot of terrible mistake=\r\ns in the impetuousness of youth. I was an infamous young man in the localit=\r\ny of Chennai where I grew up. But then one day having nothing better to do,=\r\n I left home. After roaming for 3 decades, I slowly realized what God reall=\r\ny is and how to interact with this thing.&quot; As he spoke he reached a two sto=\r\nried house, and a man, woman and a=C2=A0 young girl came out of the house. =\r\nThey invited him inside and Mr Iyengar inturn said to X, you too come insid=\r\ne, these people love me a lot so when I come to Vrindavan I stay at their h=\r\nouse. I will show you something interesting if you join me. \n\n\n\nAfter an ho=\r\nur inside the house, X was feeling very bored and irritated. The woman was =\r\nbringing different fruits and sweets for their food while the young girl wa=\r\ns massaging Mr Iyengar&#39;s feet as he lay down on a cot, enjoying the hospita=\r\nlity. X thought this man is one more fraud, he abuses everyone else but has=\r\n no qualms about shamelessly accepting the hospitality of a householder and=\r\n enjoying a good life. As soon as this thought crossed his mind, he saw tha=\r\nt the man and the woman and the girl=C2=A0 stood up and with folded hands w=\r\nere bowing down towards the cot where Mr Iyengar was lying down. X was sitt=\r\ning on the floor, facing the opp direction to the cot. He too turned round =\r\nto see=C2=A0 what was going on. What he saw made his jaw drop open in shock=\r\n. Instead of the old, bald, ragged beggar that was Mr Iyengar, there sat on=\r\n the cot a young man, who looked in his early twenties, whose whole skin wa=\r\ns dazzlingly fair, emanating a brilliant glow that lightened up\n the whole =\r\nroom. He had a shaved head, four arms, holding lotus and weapons, with ench=\r\nantingly beautiful eyes! It looked not a human being any more but a god sit=\r\nting in place of what was even five minutes back only a frail, dirty-lookin=\r\ng Mr Iyengar. \n\n\n\nX did not know what was happening. He saw the young man g=\r\nestured towards him to stand up and come near the cot. Like being hypnotize=\r\nd, X got up and walked upto the cot and the young man embraced him and X lo=\r\nst all consciousness. When he woke up, he saw he was near a temple, in a re=\r\nmote location with trees and shrubs all around. Old Mr Iyengar was nearby, =\r\nheld his hand and took him inside the temple precincts.=C2=A0 There he saw =\r\na dhuni burning, and next to it an old man, naked, sitting in meditation wi=\r\nth ash all over his body. Mr Iyengar did not say a word, pointed out that m=\r\neditating man to him and then took X out of the temple. That is the man I w=\r\nas talking about, he said. You should meet him tomorrow. He is the only one=\r\n in Vrindavan currently who has an idea what God really means. After provid=\r\ning directions of how to reach that desolate temple, Mr Iyengar hugged X ag=\r\nain and immediately he felt he was losing awareness of place/time and lapse=\r\nd into\n unconsciousness again. \n\n\n\nWhen X woke up, he was in the room in th=\r\nat house, lying on the floor. Mr Iyengar was on the bed, his old, ragged se=\r\nlf, with a mischievous smile on his face. Next day, X went to the temple as=\r\n directed. \n\n\n\n-Regards \n=C2=A0Rajarshi \n\n\n=C2=A0 \nawaktam wyaktimApannam m=\r\nanyantE mAmabuddhayah | \nparam bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24] =\r\n\n\n\n___________________________________\n\nFrom: Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@=\r\ngmail.com&gt; \nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \nSent: Monday, 23 July 2012=C2=\r\n=A0 8:13 AM \nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] To those who say that they don=E2=\r\n=80=99t believe in any religion \n\n=C2=A0 Dear Prasanth, \n\n\n&gt; To those who s=\r\nay that they don=E2=80=99t believe in any religion \n\n\n\n\nIn general, many of=\r\n those who don&#39;t believe in religion or God are being more honest than thos=\r\ne who do. After all, most people who believe in God look at him as a limite=\r\nd being to barter with. All of our biases and assumptions are most apparent=\r\n when dealing with our Gods. Often, religion has simply served to formalize=\r\n these biases. \n\n\nWhile being mired in this word of duality, we think that =\r\nan ounce of insincere prayer can undo the whole weight of &quot;paapa&quot; that we e=\r\nngage in throughout the day. And we lay this bias on our God. No wonder tha=\r\nt others look at all the suffering in the world and laugh at this concept o=\r\nf God. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit. \n\n\nWe all have plenty of paapa a=\r\nnd punya in our karmic pipeline. Instead of asking for the strength to be s=\r\nteadfast while we reap both kinds of fruits, we ask God to burn &quot;paapa&quot; and=\r\n leave the &quot;punya&quot; intact. It is us &quot;God believers&quot; who look at our lives, =\r\nignoring all the &quot;paapa phala&quot;. We look at one or two instances of &quot;punya p=\r\nhala&quot; and declare our prayers to be successful. However, an impartial obser=\r\nver sees it for what it is, and laughs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the cu=\r\nlprit. \n\n\nFor the most part, our bhakti is weak. When we are engaged in spi=\r\nritual practices, our bhakti is particularly weak, and we count the seconds=\r\n and minutes. When engaged in worldly pursuits, our bhakti is strong, and t=\r\nime really flies. And yet, we expect God to reward our weak spiritual bhakt=\r\ni and ignore our strong worldly bhakti. An impartial observer sees it for w=\r\nhat it is, and laughs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit. \n\n\nThe bes=\r\nt way to bring about new waves of bhakti is not to look at the &quot;non-believe=\r\nrs&quot; and try to convert them. All we have to do is try to eliminate our lack=\r\n of belief, and be honest with ourselves. If we can transform ourselves, th=\r\ne world will be served. \n\n\nIf we see God as the limitless power that he is,=\r\n he is difficult to define. It is difficult to capture him within a religio=\r\nn. Religion should see itself as a stepping-stone, and should ask each of u=\r\ns to _eventually_ place our feet on top of it to reach the higher goals. Un=\r\nfortunately, most religions ask us to accept them without question. They as=\r\nk us to place our heads on them with reverence, and try to prevent the spir=\r\nitually advanced from going any farther. \n\n\nsasneham, \n=C2=A0 \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n ajit \n=C2=A0 \n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \r\n---1293697098-483441661-1343629360=:23510\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ve=\r\nrdana, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dear Narasimha,&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Theoretically I understand =\r\nwhat you mean, or rather I think I understand what you mean.

In this story, God means infinity. Now what is infinity?=\r\n It cannot be described, it cannot be named, it cannot be understood using =\r\nthe five sense organs. Science does not understand infinity, art\n does not =\r\nunderstand infinity, nothing or nobody&nbsp; understands infinity. It is a =\r\nsummation of all that we know, all that we can&nbsp; imagine and all that i=\r\ns impossible for us to imagine. It is an incomprehensible force that runs t=\r\nhrough everything, from the most loveable to the most despicable , from the=\r\n most holy to the most unholy, from the greatest saint to the stupidest pie=\r\nce of rock at the bottom of the deepest ocean in the farthest planet in the=\r\n farthest solar system in the farthest universe. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font size=3D=\r\n&quot;2&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D=\r\n&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; fa=\r\nce=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#00=\r\n0000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;Now question is, can an average human being &quot;know&quot; t=\r\nhis mysterious and all pervading force? Knowing implies understanding. Clea=\r\nrly no. Then how does one interact with such a thing? One way is to conside=\r\nr\n everything, and I mean EVERYTHING from living to non-living, as a manife=\r\nstation of that force and thus learn to love the same unconditionally witho=\r\nut expecting anything in return. No wonder such unconditional love is not e=\r\nasy. It needs tremendous effort to change our own conditioning of the mind,=\r\n and work on our inherent biases and prejudices. That is what the&nbsp; aim=\r\n of sadhana is, in my view. To work on oneself, to make one ready to be abl=\r\ne to unconditionally love everything. The greater number of entities one ca=\r\nn love unconditionally, that much little bit closer one can come to interac=\r\nting with the truly infinite. And those few rare human beings who can love =\r\na whole universe unconditionally, are possibly the closest to this supreme =\r\nand unknowable force. In common language, we call them Rishis. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=\r\n=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;I like all fo=\r\nrms of\n Deities, for I find something beautiful in everyone of them. And I =\r\nalso like the One behind forms, which is so perfectly transcendental that i=\r\nt cannot be comprehended ever. It&#39;s like the surface area of the fine tip o=\r\nf a needle, or the gap between the two breaths, or the millionth part of a =\r\nsingle hair, or the endless-ness of space, or the bottomless well of stilln=\r\ness in the mind at certain points in meditation. The only thing that stops =\r\nme from getting a better understanding the grandeur of&nbsp; this formless =\r\nentity are the limitations of my own mind and body, that I have acquired ov=\r\ner millions of births. That is why Sadhana. To slowly gnaw away at my own m=\r\nind, to be better able to appreciate this endless, nameless entity. G_d. &lt;f=\r\nont size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=\r\n=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;=\r\nVerdana&quot;&gt;I do not\n believe in Moksha. What is Moksha? No rebirth? If the Un=\r\niverse itself gets born over and over and over, if Rama and Krshna come bac=\r\nk at every cycle, who am I to demand that I should not get born? Infact, wh=\r\nen a person proverbially finishes off his/her karmas, they merely go to ano=\r\nther plane in this Universe and stay there for eons of time, since time any=\r\nway moves very, very slowly in different realms. But then, if this force so=\r\n wants, it can send back any of the souls from any of the realms to any of =\r\nthe other realms to serve a certain function. And if a soul stays in a cert=\r\nain higher realm and in forced to take rebirth again, the seeds of the karm=\r\nas - which never really die off - are&nbsp; watered again by the environmen=\r\nt of birth and they sprout into saplings. And this may go even beyond one c=\r\nycle of creation. Else why would Krshna and Arjuna fight the very same enem=\r\nies that they had been fighting in the past cycle of creation? Mahabharata =\r\nsays so. I\n believe it. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; fac=\r\ne=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font=\r\n&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;Wh=\r\nat then is the final aim of all this, spirituality etc? I don&#39;t know. Maybe=\r\n, to teach us to broaden our perspectives and consequentially lessen our at=\r\ntachments to our otherwise mundane lives and its mundane problems. This is =\r\nlike a circular roller-coaster ride we see in local melas.

He was sitt=\r\ning at a satsang of a famous sadhu, enjoying the discourse, when a ragged l=\r\nooking man, with piercing unblinking eyes, comes over and asks for food. Th=\r\ne sadhu who was lecturing at the satsang, stopped and ordered someone to br=\r\ning some sweets for the ragged looking man. Then he did a pranam to the man=\r\n and said, &quot;Maharaj, please tell us some words of God&quot;. The man became angr=\r\ny, and retorted back, &quot;Why? Why waste time talking of God, no one wants God=\r\n anyway. If God comes, all will run away. So please\n continue with your lec=\r\ntures as you were doing before I came in&quot;. Everyone became uncomfortably si=\r\nlent hearing this. Meanwhile the sweets came, the man took a sweet into his=\r\n mouth, looked up at the sky and then got up and started walking off. After=\r\n he went out, the Sadhu who was lecturing, looked at his followers and said=\r\n, &quot;He is a sadhu who comes to Vrindavan once in a while, but he has probabl=\r\ny lost his mental balance due to smoking too much&nbsp; ganja&quot;. Now X, who =\r\nwas sitting there, for some weird reason felt attracted to that ragged man =\r\nand went out to see where the guy was going. As he approached the ragged lo=\r\noking man, the man turned around and spoke to X in clear English, &quot;Hello, I=\r\n was waiting for you to come and join me.&quot; X was of course taken aback, did=\r\n not expect the man to speak in English and more over he had no clue how th=\r\ne man got to know that he knew English (X was dressed in the garb of a sadh=\r\nu - saffron clothes). &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font\n size=3D&quot;2&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=\r\n=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div=\r\n align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;The man=\r\n continued, &quot;My name is Mr Iyengar. I was born near Chennai, was an Enginee=\r\nr by profession, but left home long back and have been a wondering sadhu si=\r\nnce then.&quot; X asked him, why did you derive the sadhu who was doing the sats=\r\nang? Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;All this is bogus. Actually this God thing itself=\r\n is source of all confusion. No one has a clue. Not the hordes of Sadhus, n=\r\not ordinary folks, really no one. And God is the reason for all&nbsp; the r=\r\neligious troubles and other nonsense.&quot; X felt a little irritated, &quot;Why do y=\r\nou have so much bitterness about religion/God/sadhus etc? If you have been =\r\na sadhu for long, then how come you haven&#39;t met a single genuine sadhu yet,=\r\n how is it possible?&quot;. Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;Well if I take\n Vrindavan alone=\r\n, there is only one genuine man here, rest are all as confused as anybody e=\r\nlse, merely different degrees of confusion. But you cannot meet that man, h=\r\ne is not accessible to others.&quot; Mr Iyengar continued, &quot;The root of all this=\r\n problem is this God business. Know it for certain, that man cannot know Go=\r\nd ever. What is infinite is beyond the capacity of the human brain to compr=\r\nehend. At best a man will only imagine a magnified man or a magnified woman=\r\n with super-powers. If the individual keeps doing sadhana, one day he will =\r\ncreate this form by a projection of his own mind, and he may even acquire s=\r\nupernatural abilities from this form, and generally be regarded&nbsp; by ot=\r\nhers as a man of god. But God is beyond this. That is why I say the root of=\r\n the problem is trying to understand the infinite with a finite mind and th=\r\nen stressing that one has understood correctly.&quot; While talking, the sadhu s=\r\ntopped at a small tea-stall and bought some ganja,\n and in one pull finishe=\r\nd off the chillum. Then held the smoke in a kumbaka for about 5 minutes, sl=\r\nowly releasing the smoke in small bits. Then he continued, &quot;You (meaning X)=\r\n are a young man. Have a clear mind in your head, don&#39;t get confused by all=\r\n these show of spirituality you see in holy places. When I was your age, I =\r\ndid a lot of terrible mistakes in the impetuousness of youth. I was an infa=\r\nmous young man in the locality of Chennai where I grew up. But then one day=\r\n having nothing better to do, I left home. After roaming for 3 decades, I s=\r\nlowly realized what God really is and how to interact with this thing.&quot; As =\r\nhe spoke he reached a two storied house, and a man, woman and a&nbsp; young=\r\n girl came out of the house. They invited him inside and Mr Iyengar inturn =\r\nsaid to X, you too come inside, these people love me a lot so when I come t=\r\no Vrindavan I stay at their house. I will show you something interesting if=\r\n you join me. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;\n color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Aria=\r\nl&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/fon=\r\nt&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=\r\n=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;After an hour=\r\n inside the house, X was feeling very bored and irritated. The woman was br=\r\ninging different fruits and sweets for their food while the young girl was =\r\nmassaging Mr Iyengar&#39;s feet as he lay down on a cot, enjoying the hospitali=\r\nty. X thought this man is one more fraud, he abuses everyone else but has n=\r\no qualms about shamelessly accepting the hospitality of a householder and e=\r\nnjoying a good life. As soon as this thought crossed his mind, he saw that =\r\nthe man and the woman and the girl&nbsp; stood up and with folded hands wer=\r\ne bowing down towards the cot where Mr Iyengar was lying down.
