Everyone,\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;I just thought of adding some clarifications.\n&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;First of all, when I mentioned about the utility of techniques of &quot;Hyp=\r\nnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot; for handling the problem of spirit at=\r\ntachments as well as many other problems for which we do not have reasonabl=\r\ne explanation, my assertions were limited to the utility part only and not =\r\nbeyond that. I have no knowledge about whether past life exists or not, in =\r\nfact I do not have any knowledge about anything whatsoever, as I believe, a=\r\nny knowledge without the knowledge of the THAT...The Absolute....is half kn=\r\nowledge or no knowledge in the proper sense of the term. However, in our th=\r\nis empirical life we have to still continue with life irrespective of the f=\r\nact of having absolute knowledge or not. Though we know for sure that the S=\r\nun does not make rounds of the earth but it is the other way around, still =\r\nwe use sentences like &quot;Sun rises=C2=A0in the east&quot;, &quot;Sun=C2=A0sets=C2=A0in =\r\nthe west&quot; etc. To keep life going, we keep on continuing with activities wh=\r\nich helps\n in keeping life go on...It is in this sense that I&#39;d mentioned a=\r\nbout &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot;.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;One should not com=\r\nment about the wealth inside a sea just by standing at the shore. Life is f=\r\null of infinite possibilities. When we say that the God is infinite, we jus=\r\nt can not say that the universe can behave in any particular limited ways. =\r\nBefore anyone comments about the utility of any branch of knowledge one=C2=\r\n=A0must first take a sincere dip into the same. By saying so, I do not mean=\r\n to say that if=C2=A0one really takes a sincere dip into any subject one wo=\r\nuld definitely be convinced about the same.=C2=A0By saying that one shouldn=\r\n&#39;t make comments before taking a sincere dip, I just mean to say that=C2=A0=\r\nby doing so one would prevent oneself from being dogmatic, narrow. Not only=\r\n=C2=A0blind belief in religion and religious practices=C2=A0can be termed a=\r\ns dogmatic but also in science if one loses the scientific temper.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt;Proof of pudding is in eating it, all that I can say to the persons willin=\r\ng to address any of their problems. &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regressio=\r\nn&quot; have immense utility for=C2=A0those who are desirous of addressing their=\r\n problems with an open mind. Those who are interested can read &quot; Many Lives=\r\n, Many Masters by Brian Weiss&quot; to start with.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;To respected Narasim=\r\nha sir, I would like to inform that these are not &quot;new age ideas&quot;.

Jainas used this technique of &quot;Jaati Smaran&quot; to reinfor=\r\nce renunciation in the followers.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;To Phil Stinnet, I would like to=\r\n inform that=C2=A0so far as my knowledge goes Past Life Regression (PLR) ca=\r\nn not be done over phone, but however, there are so many problems which can=\r\n be handled even over phone. To cite one example - One girl was having=C2=\r\n=A0one recurrent bad horrifying dream for past 4/5 years and she=C2=A0appro=\r\nached me for the treatment.=C2=A0But due to my=C2=A0official engagements I =\r\nwas camping at a far off place for around 2 months.=C2=A0Her problem was ge=\r\ntting worsened as it=C2=A0had=C2=A0 started affecting her professional care=\r\ner adversely. So having left with no choice, I agreed to give her a session=\r\n over phone. The phone session continued for around one and half an hour an=\r\nd she got relieved from her that recurrent dream and also started improving=\r\n her professional life. Since that day the dream has not yet visited her ag=\r\nain.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;It all depends on the openness of the mind, the strength of t=\r\nhe desire to overcome etc. The universe is much more than what we see,what =\r\nwe can see and what we can believe to see.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Regards\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\nOn Saturday, October 26, 2013 3:00 PM, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@....=\r\nin&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt;To add to the complexity of the problem=\r\n, I believe our understanding of the reincarnation is over simplified and t=\r\nhat causes more problems. Reincarnation is of the soul, and the soul will r=\r\necall those specific moments from past lives when the soul had a role to pl=\r\nay on the external consciousness. Which means if one has lived a life where=\r\n there never was any opportunity for the soul to come forth and shine, in l=\r\nater birth it cannot be recalled. For death is a complete process. Body, mi=\r\nnd, life all get dissolved and new set is generated based on need.\n&gt;\n&gt;The B=\r\nuddhists do not believe in the existence of a soul. They believe in Shunya =\r\n- which is similar to our idea of Atmah.\n Therefore\n their idea of reincarn=\r\nation\n is very different. It is like an energy stream made up of mind, body=\r\n that coalesces together\n to give the impression of an individual being, wh=\r\nich upon death get disintegrated and and spread into the greater flow of en=\r\nergy. Now part(s) of these can coalesce into another formation at a later d=\r\nate, and some other parts can simultaneous or at a different point can coal=\r\nesce into a different part. =C2=A0 Hence it is possible for a Lama, in thei=\r\nr doctrine of reincarnation, to have the some parts of his energy reincarna=\r\nte into one body while another part of his energy reincarnate into another =\r\nbody *simultaneously*. Like a Lama may have his energy of speech incarnatin=\r\ng in one person, while his energy of mind incarnating in another person, or=\r\n his energy of body incarnating in another person and all these happening s=\r\nimultaneously! It fits with their philosophy.\n&gt;\n&gt;Those philosophies which b=\r\nelieved in this kind of a reincarnation looked at the Universe only as a co=\r\nnstant flow of energy governed only by a supreme law of\n debts/balances - r=\r\nna. Hence\n rnabandhana. Jain scriptures are replete with this term. The fin=\r\nal aim of all this is to get rid of the illusion of life and move into a Su=\r\npreme Negation - Shunya/Nirvana. There is nothing here that is of any final=\r\n importance. Hence the tendency towards strict and formal renunciation of l=\r\nife and its processes.\n&gt;\n&gt;But the old Vedantic idea was different. There wa=\r\ns a soul - that is not dissolved at death unlike body/mind etc - but carrie=\r\nd forward from one life to another and the chief aim of human evolution was=\r\n to assist and develop this soul&#39;s influence on the earth. The soul inhabit=\r\ns and uses a human mind/body vehicle for this purpose. The great idea was t=\r\nhat this individual and unique soul - for no two souls are exactly same - i=\r\nn some birth finally, be able to *consciously* operate on an individual hum=\r\nan vehicle and enjoy a Divine Life.=C2=A0A Supreme Negation of life is \nnot=\r\n the ultimate aim, it is only one among many possibilities.=C2=A0 If=C2=A0 =\r\nmoving into a state \nof complete negation/Shunya/Other-world is the final a=\r\nnd inevitable aim, then there was just no need for Avataras to descend and =\r\nperform complex life-actions. The law of Karma is here too, but it is not r=\r\nestricted to only an idea of give and take of energy as in the case of the =\r\nidea of rnabandhana. The important thing is whether an action is helping th=\r\ne soul to unfurl and come forth to the surface. If it does, then it changes=\r\n the karmic equations immediately. Nature is a massive, complex, unfailing =\r\nand real-time algorithm. That is why a Ratnakara -a bandit who must have ki=\r\nlled hundreds of people can transform himself into a Rishi Valmiki [ he did=\r\n not have to actually get born a hundred times to get killed in the hands o=\r\nf those he had killed]. Whereas those aspects of life \nwhere the soul has n=\r\no play or no scope of play, are firmly governed by \nthe law of rnabandhanas=\r\n - a mechanical give and take of energy. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Now since the soul is what r=\r\nemembers and everything else being perishable, the only indestructible link=\r\n between past life and present life, it is only the soul-moments which will=\r\n be recalled, and never a complete cinematic biography recollection. That i=\r\ns fantasizing. Now if there have been lives when the soul had little or no =\r\nfrontal role to play at all, then those are dead and gone and buried six fe=\r\net under with no trace. For Nature, those lives serve no purpose at all. \n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Moreover all these are possible ONLY if and when an individual starts=\r\n living in and through the soul in a very very strong manner. That is not e=\r\nasy. \n&gt;\n&gt;-Regards\n&gt;=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I have a hundred lives bef=\r\nore me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will with hear=\r\nt insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter through them all.-Sri Aurobindo\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;On Saturday, 26 October 2013 7:38 AM, Narasimha P.V.R.

I am sure there too one can find good exorc=\r\nists, maybe not of our religion. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have very little knowledge abo=\r\nut Panchamukhi Hanumana, infact unfortunately have never ever tried any sad=\r\nhana of Lord Hanumana till date.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;However, there is a particular ma=\r\nntra of Lord Bhairava which is considered to be of excellent potency for th=\r\nese kind of problems. This form of Bhairava is a small child, known as Vatu=\r\nka. As per some Tantrik scriptures He is also referred to as the one whose =\r\nmother is Sahashra Chandika. References to this form can be found in the Ru=\r\ndrayamala, at least some versions of the Rudrayamala. This child Bhairava h=\r\nas been\n invoked for centuries\n by\n followers of Shakta/Aghor traditions fo=\r\nr protection against spirits, and specially during rituals\n of cremation gr=\r\nound. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The standard mantra is (there are many variations of this m=\r\nantra too, all are good):\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Om Hreem Vatukaay Aapad Uddhaarnnaay Ku=\r\nru Kuru Vatukaay Hreem Om&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Generally, at least 10/11 malas of the =\r\nsame should be done in one sitting. And this should be continued daily till=\r\n such time that there is some visible relief. One more thing is that, IF, t=\r\nhis is a really genuine instance of spirit possession, as far as I have see=\r\nn, it would be quite impossible to rid the problem by any exorcist from a d=\r\nistance. These days almost no one has that kind of terrific shakti to cure =\r\na case of possession from a distance. Physical presence in front of the vic=\r\ntim is a must for the one trying to help.=C2=A0So close family members, who=\r\n live with the girl will have to do the sadhana. If you go through the Bhai=\r\nrava homam manual by Narasimha, you will find methods of doing homas with t=\r\nhis mantra. But I guess being in a foreign land homas may not be that easy.=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If the family visits India, then I have a suggestion. Please ask =\r\nthem, if possible, to visit Kashi and then go to either the Kalabhairava or=\r\n Vatuka Bhairava temple. Once inside the temple speak to the main priest st=\r\nating the problem. Around these two temples in Kashi, many excellent sadhak=\r\nas of Bhairava live who are adepts in removing any kind of negative influen=\r\nce. They may charge a certain fee for the ritual and then ask the parents a=\r\nnd the girl to come with some specific samagris on a specific day/tithi ins=\r\nide the temple and then perform their rituals. Many I know have actually be=\r\nnefited. This is one method. I am sure their maybe other methods too.

For there are various cla=\r\nsses and kinds and types of entities which can possess an individual and so=\r\nme of them can be downright nasty.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Upayas are many. As so many dif=\r\nferent people have advised, these all sadhanas *can* work, theoretically, b=\r\nut whether any one of them will actually work in a specific case or not dep=\r\nends on multiple factors. Basically, there is no guarantee of any method. I=\r\nt all depends on what kind of spirit(s)/being(s) has possessed the individu=\r\nal and what their link for the same is. By link it means one has to find ou=\r\nt the root, or source of exactly what action allowed them to enter into the=\r\n person.\n Sometimes it can be\n something\n as simple as spitting somewhere (=\r\nwhere this being(s) reside), or\n causally entering into their territory and=\r\n being susceptible to such possession by certain weakness in the mind and b=\r\nody, or in some cases where such entities are deliberately send to cause ha=\r\nrm to an individual, ETC ETC. Whatever be the source, there is no sure shot=\r\n one stop method of removing and handling such a situation. It all depends =\r\non the shakti of the spirit, and the amount of shakti that those trying to =\r\nhelp are able to generate in order to remove the spirit.Moreover, if the sp=\r\nirit of a violent and extremely malevolent nature, then unless the person t=\r\nrying to remove it is an adept in this, he/she may come to serious harm.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;These things like removing possession are specializations. These do =\r\nnot fall under the ambit of normal sadhana. Unless one knows well what one =\r\nis getting into, any sadhaka with even basic common sense would do best to =\r\nstay away. Every action has its repercussion and one must know well how to\n=\r\n handle the same too. Again\n if a spirit is removed by force before the tim=\r\ne till which, based on previous karma, it was supposed to be in possession =\r\nof the individual, then that too starts a new karmic chain which will invol=\r\nve some not so pleasant consequences for the person who tried to remove the=\r\n spirit. It is all a complex chain.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[Reminds me of a particular in=\r\ndividual I knew some years ago who was an expert in exorcism. But before st=\r\narting any exorcism he would ask his Guides to tell him about the spirit as=\r\n well as the time frame for which the spirit would stay in possession as pe=\r\nr the previous karmic link between the spirit and the victim. Then he would=\r\n sit and do rituals daily to entice the spirit to leave the body of its own=\r\n free will, promising good deeds for the spirit in return. Never trying to =\r\nremove it by force. Most cases it would work. Rare cases where the spirit i=\r\ns of a very violent nature, force had to be applied.]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Best thing t=\r\no do is a) find someone\n who knows exactly how to deal with spirit possessi=\r\non and hope for the best. b) In the event the first is not possible, ask fa=\r\nmily members to pick sadhana/mantra of any deity - preferably Bhairava, Kal=\r\ni, Chandi, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are better) - a=\r\nnd do it with samkalpa with sufficient force and will and time. Which means=\r\n, a 10-20 mins path of hanuman chalisa may not help. Depends on the degree =\r\nof possession. Someone may have to spend 3-5 hours daily with any sadhana w=\r\nith the mental belief/faith/will/determination to see this through to the v=\r\nery end. While doing the sadhana keep a bowl of water in a copper pot, and =\r\nthen either make the possessed individual drink the water or sprinkle it on=\r\n him/her. And pray as hard as possible. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Best of luck and may God =\r\nhelp the family.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-Regards\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp=\r\n thee in, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue =\r\nthee like a hunter through them all.-Sri Aurobindo\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: Bhup=\r\nendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;ved=\r\nic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Saturday, 10 August 2013 8:17 AM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra for protection from spirits (at nigh=\r\nttime)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Thank you Nithin, I will convey this=\r\n to the parents.

I had trouble falling asleep, because I could hear =\r\nstrange noises -  creaking and something moving in the attic. I&#39;m very sens=\r\nitive to different energies - I don&#39;t see anything, but I feel whether some=\r\nthing divine or rather evil is present in a certain place. That place didn&#39;=\r\nt feel good to me.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;I was staying there for 10 days and every=\r\n night I would make up because of a feeling of somebody staring at me - I c=\r\nould see them but once I started focusing on them, they vanished. Sometimes=\r\n I would wake up in a terrified state breathing rapidly. One day I could de=\r\nfinitely hear some steps near the bed and a roar. I reached for my flashlig=\r\nht to see nothing.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;This doesn&#39;t seem like sleep paralysis to=\r\n me - I instantly become fully aware and I can move my body.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;Can it be that spirits live in that place disturbing my sleep? There were =\r\na few more people staying at that place and everybody had severe problems w=\r\nith sleep, so it&#39;s not just me.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;On the last night I chanted =\r\nSri Rudram at that place before going to sleep and this was the only night =\r\nI was able to sleep properly.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Upon coming back home from tha=\r\nt place I started waking up at home, feeling some strong presence - usually=\r\n some short beings (up to 50 cm in height, I&#39;ve seen them before here thoug=\r\nh); Once the sun rises, all of the strange feelings disappear and I can sle=\r\nep peacefully.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Is there any mantra that will protect me from=\r\n all kinds of astral beings at night? Something that I can chant before goi=\r\nng to sleep. This has been bothering me for some time now and it interferes=\r\n with my life.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Thank you in advance!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\r\n---477789512-339275547-1382982054=:33713\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:He=\r\nlveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;fo=\r\nnt-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is amazing to see that we have opinion (and ple=\r\nase take a note - the right opinion) on karma, reincarnation, moksha, astro=\r\nlogy and heaven.

Reincarnation is of the soul, and the soul=\r\n will recall those specific moments from past lives when the soul had a rol=\r\ne to play on the external consciousness. Which means if one has lived a lif=\r\ne where there never was any opportunity for the soul to come forth and shin=\r\ne, in later birth it cannot be recalled. For death is a complete process. B=\r\nody, mind, life all get dissolved and new set is generated based on need.&lt;b=\r\nr clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;The Buddhists do not believe in the exi=\r\nstence of a soul. They believe in Shunya - which is similar to our idea of\n=\r\n Atmah.\n Therefore\n their idea of reincarnation\n is very different. It is l=\r\nike an energy stream made up of mind, body that coalesces together\n to give=\r\n the impression of an individual being, which upon death get disintegrated =\r\nand and spread into the greater flow of energy. Now part(s) of these can co=\r\nalesce into another formation at a later date, and some other parts can sim=\r\nultaneous or at a different point can coalesce into a different part. &nbsp=\r\n; Hence it is possible for a Lama, in their doctrine of reincarnation, to h=\r\nave the some parts of his energy reincarnate into one body while another pa=\r\nrt of his energy reincarnate into another body *simultaneously*. Like a Lam=\r\na may have his energy of speech incarnating in one person, while his energy=\r\n of mind incarnating in another person, or his energy of body incarnating i=\r\nn another person and all these happening simultaneously! It fits with their=\r\n philosophy.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;Those philosophies which =\r\nbelieved in this kind of a reincarnation looked at the Universe only as a c=\r\nonstant flow of energy governed only by a supreme law of\n debts/balances - =\r\nrna. Hence\n rnabandhana. Jain scriptures are replete with this term. The fi=\r\nnal aim of all this is to get rid of the illusion of life and move into a S=\r\nupreme Negation - Shunya/Nirvana. There is nothing here that is of any fina=\r\nl importance. Hence the tendency towards strict and formal renunciation of =\r\nlife and its processes.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;But the old Ve=\r\ndantic idea was different. There was a soul - that is not dissolved at deat=\r\nh unlike body/mind etc - but carried forward from one life to another and t=\r\nhe chief aim of human evolution was to assist and develop this soul&#39;s influ=\r\nence on the earth. The soul inhabits and uses a human mind/body vehicle for=\r\n this purpose. The great idea was that this individual and unique soul - fo=\r\nr no two souls are exactly same - in some birth finally, be able to *consci=\r\nously* operate on an individual human vehicle and enjoy a Divine Life.&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; A Supreme Negation of life is \nnot the ultimate aim, i=\r\nt is only one among many possibilities.&nbsp; If&nbsp; moving into a state =\r\n\nof complete negation/Shunya/Other-world is the final and inevitable aim,\n =\r\nthen there was just no need for Avataras to descend and perform complex\n li=\r\nfe-actions. &lt;/span&gt;The law of Karma is here too, but it is not restricted t=\r\no only an idea of give and take of energy as in the case of the idea of rna=\r\nbandhana. The important thing is whether an action is helping the soul to u=\r\nnfurl and come forth to the surface. If it does, then it changes the karmic=\r\n equations immediately. Nature is a massive, complex, unfailing and real-ti=\r\nme algorithm. That is why a Ratnakara -a bandit who must have killed hundre=\r\nds of people can transform himself into a Rishi Valmiki [ he did not have t=\r\no actually get born a hundred times to get killed in the hands of those he =\r\nhad killed]. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whereas those aspects of life \nwhere the soul has=\r\n no play or no scope of play, are firmly governed by \nthe law of rnabandhan=\r\nas - a mechanical give and take of energy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv37=\r\n39164236ms__id1914 yiv3739164236ms__id664&quot; style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); fo=\r\nnt-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; font-size: 16px; fo=\r\nnt-style: normal; background-color: transparent;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv3739164236ms__id1915 yiv3739164236ms__id665&quot; =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, t=\r\nimes, serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; background-color: transpa=\r\nrent;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now since the soul is what remembers and everything else being=\r\n perishable, the only indestructible link between past life and present lif=\r\ne, it is only the soul-moments which will be recalled, and never a complete=\r\n cinematic biography recollection.
