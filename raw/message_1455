Taught by AOL, and now doing Homam, i realized that when=\r\n the work of one tool is done, if one is sincere, one is automatically lead=\r\n to the next tool for further progress.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not aware of Kriya yoga a=\r\ns it is taught by society founded by ParamaHansa Yogananda. and actually no=\r\nw i don&#39;t desire to know that. I read many a books in last 4/5 years and no=\r\nw it seems that they have done their job and hence i have no inclination to=\r\n read any book now. what i am interested now is the internal transformation=\r\n and Sadhana for that. not much interested in intellectual discussions also=\r\n but some time one get in to that.\n&gt; All the knowledge of Mahavakya and The=\r\nory of Kundalini Shakti etc.. are of no use unless it is experienced and th=\r\nat is what now interests me.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think now i have found my Guru and Nara=\r\nsimha&#39;s instructions are the one on which i wish to settle down with all my=\r\n faith but before that i need to clear every question that arises.\n&gt; \n&gt; War=\r\nm Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;=\r\nm540i98&quot; &lt;m540i98@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Utpal\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Good Question?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Why compare Apple and an Orange. They are two distinctly different i=\r\ntems.\n&gt; &gt; Any path practised sincerely under the guidance of a siddha gurud=\r\nev\n&gt; &gt; leads to end place, and once reaching there everything is alike.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; What path one gets attracted to and make progress depends on the cons=\r\ntituent sanskars that person has, accumulated over many past lives.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; All paths are equal having their own pros and cons. \n&gt; &gt; Kriya Yoga is ve=\r\nry effective in doing Nadi Shudi, the first step, along with this one needs=\r\n to practise Vaivhar Shuddi - good conduct.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am not sure about Sr=\r\ni Sri&#39;s sudarshan kriya, but babaji&#39;s kriya yoga had 10 or so different kri=\r\nya, which were taught to the sadhak one after other as he made progress, th=\r\nese kriyas can be also termed as pranayams or yogic breathing technics.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; But as one progress eventually the Kundalini Shakti rises and it take=\r\ns over and that is what is called the Raja Yoga in Bhagvat Geeta.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nOnce Kundalini Shakti starts rising and does chakra bhadan, the sadhaka sta=\r\nrts to do interesting meditation, yoga, mantra in spontanous way, i.e he is=\r\n not the doer, he is just the observer to the play of shakti.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This=\r\n leads to experiances that are not very easy to explain or describe.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Similarly doing Homam also, the path is slightly different as with contr=\r\nol and concentration on fire, one regulates internal fire and that is also =\r\nthe way.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The main benefit of fire is the impact on environment, it=\r\n cleans up the environment. Also their a sloka, from fire, we have smoke an=\r\nd it creates clouds and clouds create rain and rain creats food, it support=\r\ns the natural cycle.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; These days we see a lot of people proposing H=\r\nomams is due to the fact that we have severly polluted our environment, glo=\r\nbal warming, water pollution etc. Homams help in cleaning up the environmen=\r\nt.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Why worry about air and fire, practice what suits your mind or =\r\npractise both. do kriya yoga in morning and homan in evening.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In m=\r\ny opionion an integrated systematic approach of\n&gt; &gt; vyavhaar suddi, nadi su=\r\nddhi, service or seva, mantra yoga, other forms of yoga, bhajans and satsan=\r\ng is needed in these trying times to\n&gt; &gt; get focused.

Sri Sri Ravishankar, Rishi Prabhakar and many such known and unkn=\r\nown.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; these people (especially the first to names) advocated &#39;Kriya Yo=\r\nga&#39; in a very big way. Paramhamsa Yogananada in his celebrated work &#39;The au=\r\ntobiography of a yogi&#39; categorically mention that Kriya Yoga is like a Jet =\r\nFlight to reach the truth in comparision to the other methods which are lik=\r\ne bullock cart. he also mentions that Kriya yoga was first taught by Krishn=\r\na to Arjuna and then it was lost in time and was again revived by Mahaavata=\r\nr Bababji and passed on to Lahir Mahashaya and the others.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is clai=\r\nmed that Sri sri Ravishankar went in to deep silence for some 8 days in the=\r\n year 1980 and he came out with &#39;Sudarshan Kriya Yoga&#39; for the world. he st=\r\narted teaching that and now it is practised regularly by millions of people=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I know from my abstract experiences that Kriya yoga of Babaji and S=\r\nudarshan kriya yoga by Sri Sri are essentially same. why i say that because=\r\n one day i yearningly prayed babaji for helping me to learn Kriya yoga and =\r\nwithin a month i learnt Sudarshan kriya by AOL accidently.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nThe point is that these people are advocating some or the other form of Kri=\r\nya yoga, Raja Yoga, Hathyoga etc.. for all of these initial base is externa=\r\nl medium which is Air (Vayu). I myself have done Sudarshan Kriya for some 2=\r\n years.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Babaji or Sri Sri or any other master (present day =\r\nor ancient) have stressed on this medium. they actually didn&#39;t advocate Agn=\r\ni for the masses (Though as i said in prevous message that some have starte=\r\nd advocating Homa of late). it is obvious that they may not be oblivious of=\r\n the fact that Agni is more purer medium then air.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\n Wish to have your views on this whole subject.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; yours spiritua=\r\nlly,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
