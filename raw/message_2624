It is my belief that even if no =\r\nformal Guru is there in the Life of a MUMUKSHU, Brahman is always there for=\r\n him as Guru hence to put it anotherway, NO sincere seeker is WITHOUT GURU.=\r\n\n\nby the way following is the chain of message in VA list which triggered a=\r\nn event where Satchidanda became a Tangible guru for me.\n\nhttp://groups.yah=\r\noo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/382 \n\n\nThe above probably relevent to you=\r\nr first two questions.\n\ni again give a quote form VC where in Shankara agai=\r\nn suggest a beautiful idea.\n\n&quot;We all are God who have forgotten that realit=\r\ny&quot;.\n\nfor your third query, i wish to ask a counter question? Why we create =\r\ndreams while sleeping and then play happy, sad and frightened?\n\n***\nAgain, =\r\ni&#39;ve no realisation myself. it si probably all partially cooked or uncooked=\r\n knowedge which is reproduced, which was liked by intelligence.\n\nWarm Regar=\r\nds,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;pvklnrao&quot; &lt;pvklnrao@..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Recently one of my friend had a question for me:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Can =\r\na Guru help us? He took Jiddu Krishnamurthy&#39;s view on this. JK claims that =\r\na guru can not help any one and the self realisation has to come from with =\r\nin. My friend is asking, if a Guru is useless as JK claims, why did JK writ=\r\ne so many books (no offence to JK followers)\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. If a person has to rea=\r\nlise on himself, how it can be?\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. If the fact is that there is no I b=\r\nut for Brahman, why all this Maya? Why is Braham that is me has to go throu=\r\ngh the misery and in the end realise that he is Brahman? Why not Brahman be=\r\n Brahman and not create any thing?\n&gt; \n&gt; I could not give convincing answers=\r\n to any of the questions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Vijay\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
