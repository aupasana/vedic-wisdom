How this small yet powerful part of man c=\r\nan be completely blind! It is like a destructive drug, for whoever falls vi=\r\nctim to ego loses everything. It is like a wild animal that destroys everyt=\r\nhing in its path without consideration. Destruction of others and of one&#39;s =\r\nself, is the result of an uncontrolled ego. \n\nNourishment for the powerful =\r\nego is found in the intellect. Intellect is both wonderful and dangerous. T=\r\nrained, developed and properly used, the intellect is one of the highest fa=\r\nculties. However if used improperly, the intellect only gathers impressions=\r\n and passes judgement. Nothing is integrated, nothing is experienced and Re=\r\nality is disregarded. The intellect then believes itself to be Omniscient a=\r\nnd Master of the world.\n\nThere is a wise Indian saying. There are eight man=\r\nifestations of mental alcohol which blind the intellect: pride of race, of =\r\nyouth, of beauty, of physical strength, of family, of position, of money an=\r\nd of knowledge. Vanity blinds like the strutting arrogance of a drunkard wh=\r\no considers himself superhuman. In reality he has lost control. Many people=\r\n suffer from the illness of pride, which brings symptoms of jealousy, being=\r\n argumentative, hate and distrust.\n\nIt&#39;s not difficult to carry a full wate=\r\nr pot on the top of your head, as they do in India, but you will not get fa=\r\nr before a half-filled one sloshes and spills. In the same way, the mind is=\r\n always subject to disturbance as long as knowledge is imperfect and incomp=\r\nlete.\n\nThis is how it was with one group of men who had retired from their =\r\nprofession. Formerly railway officials, professors, military men and Sanskr=\r\nit scholars, each of them possessed a certain amount of knowledge and skill=\r\n, but were terribly conceited about them. Having nothing to do, they passed=\r\n their time travelling around, humiliating people by challenging debates. T=\r\nhey especially liked to embarrass other learned men or swamis with their pr=\r\nacticed questioning.\n\nOne day, this group came to Mahaprabhuji&#39; s ashram as=\r\n he was holding satsang.\n\n&quot;We have heard you are a great scholar and we hav=\r\ne come to be convinced it is so,&quot; one of them provocatively asked. &quot;Tell us=\r\n what you know!&quot;\n\nMahaprabhuji had no chance to reply before another interr=\r\nupted, who had some poetic ability.\n\n&quot;Recite one of your poems, we want to =\r\nassess your skill!&quot;\n\nRemaining peaceful, Mahaprabhuji welcomed the men with=\r\n a loving heart, just as he welcomed all visitors and graciously invited th=\r\nem to sit down. He looked at them and as nothing was hidden from him, he kn=\r\new their thoughts and characteristics. In a bhajan he began to reveal their=\r\n negative attributes, so as to instruct them in better behaviour.\n\nDear rea=\r\nders, it is difficult to translate Mahaprabhuji&#39; s beautiful poetry into En=\r\nglish, as it has quite a different feeling in Hindi. Therefore I can only a=\r\nttempt to convey the general essence of that bhajan here.\n\nKAHA VED PATHI T=\r\nRIPATHI KAHAVE\n\nThose who study and call themselves scholars,\n\nThose who co=\r\nnsider themselves poets,\n\nThose who dress themselves like holy men,\n\nThose =\r\nwho prize external cleanliness,\n\nWhat do they gain if they have not studied=\r\n the Supreme\n\nOr purified their mind?\n\nIf they have not realized God,\n\nWhat=\r\n&#39;s the use of poetry or a splendid gown?\n\nThose who study law yet still don=\r\n&#39;t know the law of God,\n\nThose who think only of their body\n\nWhich will one=\r\n day be ash spread by the wind,\n\nWhat can they gain from this?\n\nOnly God ca=\r\nn stop the fallacy of such thoughts,\n\nWithout Him, all is just pretence.\n\nI=\r\nn further verses the bhajan refers to the true aim of life: to behave well =\r\nand not only to `appear&#39; well.\n\nSuddenly it seemed to these retired men, th=\r\nat they had accomplished absolutely nothing in their entire lives. They wer=\r\ne seized with sorrow as they realized that they were growing old and might =\r\nnot have much time to make amends.\n\n&quot;O Master,&quot; they cried, &quot;is it really t=\r\noo late for us? We surrender ourselves to you and humbly beg your guidance =\r\nand protection. Gracious Lord, can you forgive us?&quot;\n\nMahaprabhuji&#39; s heart =\r\nis full of love for all creatures and there was no question of anger or ann=\r\noyance within him. He denied no one, forgave all and corrected and removed =\r\nthe negative qualities of those who put their trust in him. Lovingly he loo=\r\nked at them and sang again:\n\nSANTO SE KOI SIROMANI MANUSYA\n\nThe Saint is th=\r\ne crown of humanity!\n\nThe Gita, Ramayana, Bible and Koran all praise the gl=\r\nory of Saints,\n\nTheir words shower all mankind in Blessing.\n\nThe Saint self=\r\nlessly gives, he gives everything to everyone,\n\nHe lives not for himself, h=\r\ne lives only for others,\n\nAs a messenger of God, he comes in love and compa=\r\nssion\n\nTo purify the world of sins!\n\nGod&#39;s mercy we experience through the =\r\nblessing of the Saint,\n\nThe Saint is unsurpassed\n\nIn love, devotion, humili=\r\nty, kindness and mercy.\n\nWhen Mahaprabhuji had finished the bhajan, he said=\r\n, &quot;With the blessing of a Saint it is possible to realize everything, but d=\r\non&#39;t be deceived, dear brothers! As you well know, the ego surrounds itself=\r\n with the appearance of wisdom and many call themselves holy or pretend to =\r\nbe wise. Go where your thirst will be quenched. If your heart is really see=\r\nking then you will find your Master. My dears, your prayers for forgiveness=\r\n are heard, it is never too late to do good, every second is valuable.&quot;\n\nTh=\r\ne men begged Gurudeva, &quot;Lord, please initiate us and take us as your discip=\r\nles.&quot;\n\n&quot;I will give you a mantra which you shall practise every day,&quot; Mahap=\r\nrabhuji answered. &quot;From now on learn to be as kind and humble to all as muc=\r\nh you were unkind before. Never forget there is something you can learn fro=\r\nm everyone and only God the Almighty is perfect.&quot;\n\nGrateful for his words, =\r\nthey left Mahaprabhuji and praised him with all their hearts. For these men=\r\n the following words from The Ramayana proved true: &quot;Only by God&#39;s mercy is=\r\n it possible to meet a realized Master.&quot;\n(taken from http://www.yogainda il=\r\nylife.org/ swamiji/lilaamri t/victory- over-false- pride)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Th=\r\ne INTERNET now has a personality.
