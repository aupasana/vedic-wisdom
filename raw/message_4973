If one with a w=\r\neak internal fire visualizes an internal homam, it will not be that effecti=\r\nve. Of course, it is safe to do and is better than sitting idle or watching=\r\n TV or other such activities. But homam in an external fire is more effecti=\r\nve for most people.\n \nWhen we do homam, i.e. when we invoke a deity in fire=\r\n and make offerings while focusing the mind on sacred chants, essentially w=\r\ne are trying to strengthen, by resonance, the fire that burns inside one, w=\r\nhich transforms all of one&#39;s &quot;experiences&quot; into the underlying Truth. This =\r\nis the fire that makes one experience deities and finally the Absolute. Jus=\r\nt as a young scholar benefits from spending time with a teacher or a mentor=\r\n or a senior scholar, this internal fire benefits from spending time with a=\r\n good-sized external fire in which deities are invited and visualized.\n \n* =\r\n       *        *\n \nApart from this fundamental fire, there are so many spe=\r\ncific fires in us. For example, jatharaagni (digestive fire) burns in the s=\r\ntomach and digests food. Whenever you are eating, you are effectively perfo=\r\nrming a homam in this fire. Of course, this fire is grosser than the above =\r\nsubtle fire that allows us to experience the Absolute. Nevertheless, it is =\r\nfire too. Whenever you eat any food, you can chant a mantra and imagine tha=\r\nt you are making the offering to god.\n \n*        *        *\n \nPlease rememb=\r\ner one thing. There are some people on this yahoogroup, who are already qui=\r\nte pure with just a few shortcomings that are blocking them. They have made=\r\n good progress in the last 3-4 years. In the years to come, some more peopl=\r\ne will make a lot of progress. What is good enough for them may not be good=\r\n enough for most people.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; 2. Normally, at times, w=\r\nhen I offer akshatas as flowers, I feel\n&gt; uncomfortable. With mental homam,=\r\n I could imagine I am actually\n&gt; using all the flowers in the world\n&gt; 3. No=\r\nrmally, naivedyam is more of routine. It is difficult to\n&gt; imagine the God =\r\neating it really. How ever, when\n&gt; it is done mentally, I could imagine the=\r\n God actually eating.\n \nWhy not? Even in an external homam, one can offer s=\r\nome simple food and imagine the god in fire to be actually eating that food=\r\n! External ritual is not an obstruction for visualization. In fact, it prov=\r\nides a platform for visualization. You can build whatever structures you wa=\r\nnt, on top of that platform!\n \nOne can imagine that the deity is really sit=\r\nting in fire. One can imagine that the deity is being given a garland with =\r\nseveral nice flowers. One can imagine that the deity is enjoying the incens=\r\ne. One can imagine that the deity is enjoying nice foods. And so on.\n \n*   =\r\n     *        *\n \n&gt; Don&#39;t worry about not completing homam. The objective o=\r\nf the\n&gt; homam is to loose your self. If you lost your way in middle\n&gt; and g=\r\net immersed in meditation, it only indicates good.\n \nAbsolutely. Of course,=\r\n don&#39;t do it intentionally. That would be a pretension.\n \nIf you start medi=\r\ntating in the middle of homam and lose track of homam and fire goes away by=\r\n the time you come back to your senses, do not worry about it. But, if you =\r\nare fully aware of your surroundings and homam, it is a good idea to ensure=\r\n that the fire does not go away.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Softwa=\r\nre, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; =\r\nritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://Saras=\r\nwatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisd=\r\nom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n----=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- =\r\npvklnrao &lt;pvklnrao@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; I had done homam ment=\r\nally few times, and I would not hesitate to do so in future.

How ever, the presence of fire does have so=\r\nme real impact. The sound of the dry coconut/small wood cracking, the smell=\r\n and heat are missed when I did the homam mentally. So, I prefer an externa=\r\nl homam, but, when you can&#39;t do resort to doing the same mentally.\n&gt; \n&gt; Aft=\r\nerwards, I did mental homam few times while I am in airplane.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some thi=\r\nng is better than nothing. I remember Narasimha mentioning that he did homa=\r\nm mentally in Korea. Do not hesitate to do so.\n&gt; \n&gt; Don&#39;t worry about not c=\r\nompleting homam. The objective of the homam is to loose your self. If you l=\r\nost your way in middle and get immersed in meditation, it only indicates go=\r\nod.

I have browsed several posts here and I do not know =\r\nof any \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reference in any traditional shastras, so I have a question=\r\n regarding the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; performance of homam in one&#39;s mind. There must be t=\r\nimes in one&#39;s life when \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; several restrictions of time or place or a=\r\nny other reasons - do not allow one to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perform an external homam u=\r\nnder the &quot;perfect&quot; conditions that one would like. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; 1. So how does one go about this? Does one mentally visualize oneself pe=\r\nrforming \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all the external rituals from A-Z? What if one&#39;s mind can=\r\nnot &quot;multi-task&quot; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; synchronize the mental recitation of mantras =\r\nwith the mental performance of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actions? What if one cannot maintai=\r\nn the same standards of external environment \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purity, discipline et=\r\nc? Is it then best to avoid mental homam altogether?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Ca=\r\nn one derive the same benefit from a mental homam that one would derive \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from an external homam?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Could a regular performan=\r\nce of mental homam remove the impediments that is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blocking one in =\r\ndoing homam in real life and may it result in one becoming \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fortuna=\r\nte enough to carry out real-life homam by the grace of God?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Many many Thanks\n\n\n"}}
