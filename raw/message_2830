I have always ca=\r\nrried words of Thakur in my heart. one of the greatest words which were spo=\r\nken to M during his second meeting with him. extending that spirit, If Kali=\r\n is sincerely prayed, will she not know? SHE is every where. isn&#39;t it. so i=\r\nn one sense, Idol becomes redundant however it has a purpose that it remind=\r\ns one of Kali in a more effective way.\n\nwhat do you say?\n\nSameer also said =\r\nnice thing. If going to Holy places, do not pray for worldly desire. try ha=\r\nrd to refrain from them and then what negative energies can do?\n\nsorry to b=\r\nutt in.\n\nWarm Regards\n\nUtpal\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi=\r\n nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Samir,\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; You are very correct=\r\n. Infact it was from one writing of Sri Aurobindo that I first got an idea =\r\nthat even a wrong pressence can come into an idol, though I am yet to recoi=\r\nncile it to the understanding I have about methods of worship. He goes to m=\r\nention that many of the Kali idols often have a presence created by the wor=\r\nshipper which is Kali without being divine at all, a grotesque formation ou=\r\nt of fear and other negative emotions of the worshipper. Such a being is of=\r\n no help, and should not be worshipped. The actualy Mahakali, Aurobindo say=\r\ns, is splendid golden in color as he saw it. He said it is also becuase of =\r\nwrong pranpratistha and priests who do not know how to do it etc.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; =\r\n=A0\n&gt; I find this information difficult to understand yet. I mean, if I am =\r\ncalling to Kali or any deity, is it not going to Kali - the divine one? Wha=\r\nt does it matter how the pranpratistha has been done, if I am using the nam=\r\ne Kali to address my prayers. There is only one who is Kali, and when I pra=\r\ny with Her name,=A0I feel it should always go to that One. How can it reach=\r\n any other being at all? \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Now imagine someone gets an image of Kali=\r\n and prays to it with fear, insecurities etc and other negative emotional q=\r\nualities, I can understand that these emotions - which are eventually an en=\r\nergy - may get lodged into the idol. But what power does that mass of emoti=\r\non have? In my view nothing. Neither good not bad. Now say another person c=\r\nomes infornt of the idol and bows down and says a prayer to Kali, where is =\r\nthat going to reach? I believe - logically - it should reach=A0the real Kal=\r\ni wherever She maybe and idol will, even though it has negative emtions=A0l=\r\nodged in it,=A0will only play the part of symbol that makes one remember Ka=\r\nali. \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; This is how I look at it logically.

Th=\r\ney perform rituals and make offerings while harbouring\n&gt; such desires. Such=\r\n tamasic and rajasic sentiments attract\n&gt; ill-intentioned beings from the v=\r\nital plane to the place of worship.\n&gt; \n&gt; Therefore she said that one should=\r\n be cautious about which temples one\n&gt; visits, especially if one is weak an=\r\nd susceptible to negative energies.\n&gt; And when one does visit, one should t=\r\nry one&#39;s hardest to do so with the\n&gt; spirit of complete surrender to *whate=\r\nver* Divine presence is there (and\n&gt; without seeking to fulfil petty desire=\r\ns).\n&gt; \n&gt; So it may be that there is a risk.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Samir\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; On 08/10/2009 17:54, rajarshi nandy wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In this context of divine pressence, is Idol worship risky?
