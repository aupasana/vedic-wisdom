I thought that Achamanam is required BEFORE performing a spiritual activity, which we do anyway. But what is the significance of doing it AFTER it? Similarly, if you remember the end of the holy Aditya Hrudhayam stotram, there&#39;s the verse &quot;thriraachamya suchirbhootvaa dhanuraadhaaya veeryavaan&quot; which comes after the verse which mentions Bhagavan Sri Rama chanting the stotram. Is it that the ensuing battle itself is considered a spiritual activity needing purification before one starts it? When I try relate it to the popular custom of &quot;not washing one&#39;s hands and feets&quot; upon arrival back home, after visiting a temple, I get confused. \n\nRegards, \nHari \n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-713073589-1244081873=:62709\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; style=&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;Dear All, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the end of Sandhya Vandanam, we do Achamanam again.
