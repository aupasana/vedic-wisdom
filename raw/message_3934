T=\r\nhe fact is that the uttama Guru appears to sadhakas of the same stature. In=\r\n the present times, there is a shortage of such people. There are fewer utt=\r\nama sishya and hence there is a shortage of uttama Gurus. \n\nAgain it is not=\r\nhing new to say that God must be the Guru. This is how it has been and will=\r\n be. Like the sastras say - Guru, mantra and devatha are one and there shou=\r\nld be no difference seen between them. In the same way, the sastra say that=\r\n the one who considers the physical being his Guru is not destined to succe=\r\ned. \n\nEven today if a uttama Guru is born, He/She may want to attract only =\r\nthe uttama sishya and not an adhama sishya. Unless one is that sishya, one =\r\nwill always see a million defects in ones Guru- EVEN if he is a maha-siddha=\r\n. The fault is in the viewer. What to say of Guru, one can find fault in De=\r\nvatha as well. The problem is not with the Guru/Devatha, but with the viewe=\r\nr/sadhaka who is still subject to his/her own conditioning and the accumula=\r\nted results of sins acting on him/her. The Guru as well as the Devatha are =\r\neternal and our own limited personalities are not. The &#39;dress&#39; the Guru wea=\r\nrs ( His/Her own limited personality which He/She has mostly overcome) is a=\r\nlso not permanent. This is why the tantras say that Guru vakya is often mor=\r\ne powerful than the Guru.The vakya comes from the Devatha in the form of th=\r\ne Guru. \n\nThe very fact that various tantras spend time in explaining Guru =\r\nlakshanam and sishya lakshanam is very revealing about how things have been=\r\n for the past few 1000 years at least.\n\nThe Guru as well as the devatha are=\r\n never external.                Our entire sadhana lies in realisation of t=\r\nhis fact. \n\nPeople are led by their own karma to false Gurus. There is litt=\r\nle need to look at false Gurus and despair(may be not you, but as many peop=\r\nle are wont to). This is like looking at a bad husband or cheating wife and=\r\n believing that all husbands or wives are like that.\n\nThere were very clear=\r\n indications about someone like Nityananda( whom I dont condemn for the par=\r\nticular aspect of having been unable to over come his human weakness) being=\r\n not a fit Guru. \n\nIMHO a sadhaka needs to be an example of how things or p=\r\neople could be in this world and provide an inspiration and a counter curre=\r\nnt even when things outside seem to be falling to bits.\n\nMy apologies if I =\r\nhave spoken any nonsense or caused any offense.I may have stated the obviou=\r\ns in  many different ways or alluded to things without addressing them. I d=\r\no not say &#39;dont do any sadhana and keep searching for a Guru for ever&#39;; but=\r\n I do not agree with giving up without searching. I am sure anyone with a g=\r\nood Guru will understand what I say. All correct things are Her grace and a=\r\nll nonsense that of my limited ago.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nS\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yah=\r\noogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Rajarshi,\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; But in the times to come, the idea of running after a guru\n&gt; &gt; will cha=\r\nnge. Each one must take God as his/her guru and keep\n&gt; &gt; doing sadhana and =\r\nNature will teach in the best possible way.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I know one person with sp=\r\niritual inclination who went on a long pilgrimage visiting many temples and=\r\n ashrams in India. He was hoping that he would meet a realized master who w=\r\nould bless him and give him a big push spiritually. He was an old classmate=\r\n of Manish and Manish was telling him from the beginning that he would not =\r\nfind anyone like that. Manish told him to just sit at home and do intense s=\r\nadhana - homam, japam etc. But still that person wanted to go around in sea=\r\nrch of a guru who would lift him. No need to say he did not find anyone lik=\r\ne that.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; We indeed had spiritual masters in =\r\nthe past who were capable of lifting people just like that. However, such m=\r\nasters are rare today. In fact, Paramahansa Yogananda said that great maste=\r\nrs will no longer descend to earth in coming years. I interpret what he sai=\r\nd slightly differently. Some great masters may still descend to earth in fu=\r\nture, but they may not act like the sadgurus of past. They may only show th=\r\ne (a) path and leave responsibility in the hands of people.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Why shoul=\r\nd it be so?\n&gt;  \n&gt; The age of fake swamis and babas who are secretly after n=\r\name and money has dawned (or will soon dawn) on earth. They will pretend to=\r\n be realized masters though they are not. They will be difficult to discern=\r\n. This is going to render futile for many the search for a sadguru to whom =\r\none can completely surrender. In the old days, if you found a sadguru, surr=\r\nendered to him/her and followed his/her commands blindly, your life would b=\r\ne made and you would achieve whatever was meant to be achieved spiritually =\r\nin that life. However, the same cannot be said about following a fake guru =\r\nblindly. In an age when there are probably going to be far more fake gurus =\r\nthan sadgurus, isn&#39;t it advisable to rewrite the blueprint of a spiritual j=\r\nourney? Instead of searching for a sadguru and surrendering to him, it may =\r\nbe better for most seekers to just do sadhana and take God or Fire as guru =\r\nas Rajarshi wisely said.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The old thinking will slowly be replaced by =\r\na new model appropriate for the new times. What Paramahansa Yogananda said =\r\nis along the same lines. More developments in future may re-inforce the new=\r\n approach.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Paramahansa Yogananda said that =\r\ngreat masters will not descend to earth in future. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa =\r\nsaid that he would be back after about 100 years accompanied by others who =\r\naccompanied him earlier and that many people would be liberated en masse th=\r\nis time. How do we reconcile?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Quite possibly, Ramakrishna will not do=\r\n any miracles or touch people and grant them liberation just like that, but=\r\n he will probably show them how to find god. He will not take them to god h=\r\nimself, but point them to a path that will lead to god. He will probably in=\r\nspire many people to do intense sadhana and become liberated.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *      =\r\n  *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; In the old days, we had brave kshatriyas who were very d=\r\nharmik and unselfish. It made sense to put power completely and uncondition=\r\nally in their hands. It worked for the benefit of all. As such kshatriyas b=\r\necame rare and world started to be dominated by adharmik and selfish seeker=\r\ns of power, Nature adjusted the course of humanity and most of the world is=\r\n today based on the concept of democracy or switching to it slowly.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I=\r\nn spiritual matters also, we had learned braahmanas who were very dharmik, =\r\nunselfish and liberated. it made sense to place people&#39;s spiritual lives co=\r\nmpletely and unconditionally in their hands. As such braahmanas become rare=\r\n and world starts to be dominated by adharmik and selfish possessors of kno=\r\nwledge (who are still in the web of Maayaa), Nature may adjust the course o=\r\nf humanity and redefine religion and spiritual progress based on more relev=\r\nant concepts and ideas.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; The bottomline: If =\r\nyou like a guru or his teachings, benefit from them. But do not worry about=\r\n finding a sadguru as given in some scriptures and just keep doing sadhana.=\r\n Surrender to god, do homam/japam etc and wait patiently. It is a more frui=\r\ntful method than to search for a sadguru who will lift you.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best rega=\r\nrds,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writin=\r\ngs,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; =\r\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      Films that make a d=\r\nifference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yah=\r\noo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/gro=\r\nup/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Namast=\r\ne,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I too believe we should give the benefit of doubt to Swami Nit=\r\nyananda.
