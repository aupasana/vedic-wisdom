Whe=\r\nn I was meditating before replying to you, a really beautiful and meaningfu=\r\nl analogy came to me and I think it is worth sharing with more people than =\r\njust you. To ensure your anonymity, I removed references in the quoted mail=\r\n below that may help one identify you.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nFirst =\r\nI will answer your first question in detail, because that can automatically=\r\n answer other questions.\n=C2=A0\n\n&gt; 1. Are Vedic (Pure Vaithika rituals) dif=\r\nferent from Mantra Shastras\n&gt; (people explain that mantra shastra does not =\r\noriginate from the vedas,\n&gt; but classified under tantra). Did Mantra shastr=\r\nas not originate from vedas?\n=C2=A0\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nWhen people say=\r\n what is in Veda and what is not, honestly I can only laugh. They are only =\r\nfooling themselves. Reciting Veda with perfect swara or mastering a celebra=\r\nted commentary does not help one understand Veda. In fact, understanding ea=\r\nch single verse in Veda requires great tapascharya. Understanding a verse i=\r\nn Veda is neither possible with energy flowing in Ida nadi (intuition) nor =\r\nin Pingala nadi (logic and analysis). It is possible only with energy flowi=\r\nng in Sushumna nadi. It is possible with neither intuition nor logic, but o=\r\nnly with *revelation* and simply, for the lack of a better expression, dire=\r\nct knowledge.\n=C2=A0\nWhen one meditates long enough on a verse, the verse m=\r\nay simply be revealed to the yogi. THAT is the only way to understand a Ved=\r\nic verse. For most people, it is not possible to decipher even a single ver=\r\nse in an entire life, let alone a passage.\n=C2=A0\nBottomoline is: Almost no=\r\nbody understands Veda today. What are considered &quot;pure vaidika rituals&quot; are=\r\n merely another variety of rituals created by someone at some point of time=\r\n. From the point of view of authenticity as granted by Veda, there is no di=\r\nfference between them and other aagamic rituals, though people ignorantly b=\r\nelieve otherwise.\n=C2=A0\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nA simple analogy may help =\r\nclarify a lot of things related to this complicated issue a little. What th=\r\ne thing in the analogy represents is shown here and there in square bracket=\r\ns [].\n=C2=A0\nOnce there were many people who lived near the sea [Brahman/Aa=\r\ntman] . They regularly sat by the sea and enjoyed the sight and=C2=A0sound =\r\nof the sea [experienced Brahman]. They described the sea in some nice crypt=\r\nic poems [Veda].\n=C2=A0\nAs people started living a little away from the sea=\r\n [less spiritually evolved], someone had to put together some instructions =\r\non how to reach the sea. He said, &quot;keep walking towards east&quot; and the instr=\r\nuctions grew with time. People faithfully followed the instructions [ritual=\r\ns].\n=C2=A0\nPeople started moving further and further inland and started liv=\r\ning in a landlocked desert far away from the sea. This generation had never=\r\n seen a pool of water like a lake, let alone a sea. They faithfully perform=\r\ned the ritual of walking towards east, but did not find sea. They debated e=\r\nndlessly whether one had to walk one mile or two miles or three miles and f=\r\normed different schools of thought. Some walked their chosen distance, foun=\r\nd a tree or a building or some interesting object=C2=A0and even became sati=\r\nsfied that that was sea!\n=C2=A0\nThen came some great person, whose instinct=\r\ns led him to take a horse instead of walking and ride it for a long distanc=\r\ne [use of other tools]. He did find the sea after a few months. He put toge=\r\nther newer instructions to reach the sea, which included riding a horse [ne=\r\nw aagamas].\n=C2=A0\nPeople performing the old rituals objected to this and s=\r\naid &quot;but then this horse thing is not granted by the book of sea. This is a=\r\n new path and different from the &quot;pure&quot; sea ritual&quot; [&quot;pure&quot; Vedic ritual]. =\r\nBy now, people did not even understand what the cryptic poems of the origin=\r\nal &quot;book of sea&quot; mean, but they simply believed that those poems taught the=\r\n old &quot;pure&quot; sea rituals that they were used to. They were blissfully unawar=\r\ne that the original instructions were meant for someone already close to se=\r\na and the newer instructions came from someone who actually saw the sea and=\r\n knew where they currently lived and how to get to the sea from there!\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nSlowly many new sets of instructions involving horses, chariots etc wer=\r\ne taught and many new paths to the sea were=C2=A0outlined=C2=A0instead of j=\r\nust instructing people to walk towards east=C2=A0[evolution of mantra/tantr=\r\na/ yantras].\n=C2=A0\nOne particular path through jungles was dangerous [agho=\r\nra and other dark tantric paths involving practice of sex, meat, wine=C2=A0=\r\netc]. Though the distance to sea was much shorter through that jungle, it w=\r\nas just too dangerous and only the bravest and strongest could make it. The=\r\nre were cruel dacoits and wild animals [chance of a fall in a risky ritual]=\r\n and many weak people travelling to sea via that path were killed. A wise m=\r\nan who knew the entire territory well=C2=A0came forward, condemned that pat=\r\nh and discouraged people from trying that path. Since then, even people who=\r\n were strong enough to successfully make it in that path desisted from it.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nAs time progressed, people started fighting too much about whose pat=\r\nh was superior. They were foolish, not smart enough to adopt the original i=\r\nnstructions, of either the so-called &quot;pure&quot; sea path or the so-called &quot;new&quot;=\r\n path or other variations, for the changed geography and changed times. Man=\r\ny followed the instructions blindly, hit roadblocks and did not reach sea. =\r\nMany did not even know that &quot;reaching the sea&quot; was the actual goal of all t=\r\nheir joirneys. They only thought they were supposed to follow the instructi=\r\nons faithfully and there was no need to adopt to the changed geographical t=\r\nerritory and time. They even condemned those who actually went to sea, came=\r\n back and gave updated directions for their place and=C2=A0time, for violat=\r\ning tradition.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nIn case the analogy is not cl=\r\near, here is a brief summary of its points. Veda is about realizing self. V=\r\neda describes various aspects of=C2=A0the state of self-realization. That i=\r\ns why it is considered the highest knowledge. Other allied subjects throw s=\r\nome light on possible ways to reach that state. While definitive statements=\r\n can be made on the actual state of self-realization itself, no definitive =\r\nstatements can be made on how to reach it. The path depends on one&#39;s curren=\r\nt position!\n=C2=A0\nGreat men in many spiritual paths, within Hinduism as we=\r\nll as outside of it, came, experienced that state, understood the current s=\r\ntate of people around them=C2=A0and gave specific instructions on how to re=\r\nach that state from the current state. Some followed the instructions and e=\r\nxperienced the state. Some instead kept arguing about the contradictions be=\r\ntween paths.\n=C2=A0\nPlease re-read the story and try to understand what eac=\r\nh part of the story represents. If you understand this analogy well, this c=\r\nan really clarify the meaningless nature of so many debates that people was=\r\nte time with!\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\n\n&gt; 2. I read from somewhere that=\r\n Sri Sri Adi Sankara has condemned\n&gt; Tantrik practices. But I also hear and=\r\n read that he is a great Sri Vidya\n&gt; Upasaka himself. If Sri Vidya has its =\r\nroots from Tantra, what did\n&gt; Sri Adi Sankara condemn? \n=C2=A0\nHe did conde=\r\nmn some vaamaachaara (left-hand) practices of tantra like the use of sex, a=\r\nlcohol, meat etc.\n=C2=A0\nHowever, please go back to my analogy. A great man=\r\n may condemn the use of a short path to reach the sea if it has a lot of wi=\r\nld animals and=C2=A0dacoits and many travellers through that path recently =\r\nlost their lives. It does not mean that path is totally unusable. It only m=\r\neans that too many people incapable of travelling on that path are using it=\r\n of late and so the great man was compelled to stop the practice.\n=C2=A0\nIf=\r\n the same great man is reincarnated at a different time when several adept =\r\nsouls he has a rina with are about to be reincarnated, he may not condemn t=\r\nhe path and instead write on travelling that jungle path carefully!\n=C2=A0\n=\r\nThe words of great masters need to be interpreted within the context of the=\r\nir desa, kaala and paatra and within the context of the purpose of that par=\r\nticular birth.\n=C2=A0\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\n\n&gt; 3. What is vamachara? if i=\r\nt is the left hand method - sex, drinks etc,\n&gt; why must it be practiced at =\r\nall?\n=C2=A0\nSuppose one&#39;s house is close to the market and the market noise=\r\n reaches one&#39;s house. Suppose that noise=C2=A0is disturbing one&#39;s meditatio=\r\nn, i.e. one is unable to focus on god amid all the noise. There are two app=\r\nroaches one can take - (1) run away from the noise, find a place of solitud=\r\ne and meditate there. (2) rise to the challenge, meditate right there and d=\r\nevelop the ability to turn off the sensory input to the mind, i.e. get mast=\r\nery and control over the part of the mind that is making one vulnerable to =\r\nthis disturbance. After all, the noise from outside is NOT the problem - th=\r\ne problem is the *inability* of one&#39;s mind to turn off that sensory input. =\r\nBy controlling one&#39;s mind, one can focus attention on god irrespective of w=\r\nhat is happening outside.\n=C2=A0\nApproach (1) is not bad. If one is weak-mi=\r\nnded and has a decent chance of failure with approach (2), then approach (1=\r\n) is definitely prudent and worthwhile. But, if one has a strong mind and c=\r\nan succeed with approach (2), it is great. It hastens one&#39;s progress.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nVaamaachaara is also like that, but a more extr=\r\neme form of testing one&#39;s self-control by rising to the challenge.\n=C2=A0\nP=\r\nlease realize that vaamaachaara/ aghora is not about the use of sex, wine e=\r\ntc for the kick of it. It is about their use to test oneself with the tough=\r\nest challenges and hone one&#39;s self-control. Self-realization comes when sel=\r\nf-control is perfect and one&#39;s mind can always be focussed on god no matter=\r\n what is going on around one. If one is either attracted or averse to any o=\r\nne thing, that is enough to block self-realization.\n=C2=A0\nHowever, if one =\r\nis weak, it is better to stay away from vaamaachaara. One needs to do other=\r\n practices and strengthen oneself. If a really pure yogi with perfect self-=\r\ncontrol is able to focus on god with all his mind even when he is drunk and=\r\n sitting naked with a beautiful naked woman tightly embracing him, then he =\r\ncan try that to test his self-control and hone it. But, if that is going to=\r\n=C2=A0tempt one, get the mind away from god and onto a physical enjoyment, =\r\nthen one better not try that path! Just as one who does not have a strong m=\r\nind to meditate amid noise should meditate in solitude and hone one&#39;s self-=\r\ncontrol, one who does not have a strong mind to keep the focus on god in th=\r\ne middle of normally depriving practices such as wine, meat and sex should =\r\nstay away from those.\n=C2=A0\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nIn my analogy before, t=\r\nhe short jungle path to the sea having the danger of wild animals and dacoi=\r\nts represents the vaamaachaara path of aghora. If one not having the wherew=\r\nithal to battle and kill the wild animals and dacoits tries that path, one =\r\nmay be killed. Similarly, one who wants self-realization using this path wi=\r\nll fall if one does not have perfect self-control. If one takes this path b=\r\necause it sounds cool or exciting, one is likely to fall. It is only for th=\r\ne fittest and bravest.\n=C2=A0\nIf there is ANY weakness in one&#39;s self-contro=\r\nl, one can NOT follow this path. Just as there are many paths from the dese=\r\nrt to the sea in my analogy, there are many paths to self-realization. One =\r\nshould follow the path that is appropriate for one based on previous samska=\r\nras, strengths and weaknesses.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\n&gt; Is it not a f=\r\nact that Sri Ambal lies above all these? \n=C2=A0\n:-) Sri Ambal (the Divine =\r\nMother) does not lie above or below anything. She lies everywhere! All know=\r\nledge, all desires and all actions of all beings are Her own different mani=\r\nfestations.\n=C2=A0\nIf a yogi with perfect self-control drinks wine and=C2=\r\n=A0sits naked with a beautiful naked woman tightly embracing him and yet ke=\r\neps his mind fully focussed on god, his self-control, his focus on god are =\r\nall different manifestations of the Divine Mother only.\n=C2=A0\nAs a matter =\r\nof fact, even if one gives in to base instincts and pursues carnal pleasure=\r\ns, his desires and actions are also different manifestations of Divine Moth=\r\ner only. The Mother gives rise to so many lower level forms with specific d=\r\nomains of responsibility. The Mother takes the form of Lakshmi and Alakshmi=\r\n as well. She takes the form of Vidya and Avidya as well. All opposites and=\r\n polarities are actually Her manifestations only.\n=C2=A0\nHowever, those who=\r\n are more comfortable with Lakshmi and Vidya and uncomfortable with Alakshm=\r\ni and Avidya will look at only the former pair as manifestation of Divine M=\r\nother and remain in duality. That is a valid point of view. However, the *u=\r\nltimate* reality is that She is All.\n=C2=A0\nI need to sleep now. I will sto=\r\np here. Hope that put a few things in perspective.

(2) rise to the challenge, me=\r\nditate right there and develop the ability to turn off the sensory input to=\r\n the mind, i.e. get mastery and control over the part of the mind that is m=\r\naking one vulnerable to this disturbance.

It is about their use to test oneself w=\r\nith the toughest challenges and hone one&#39;s self-control. Self-realization c=\r\nomes when self-control is perfect and one&#39;s mind can always be focussed on =\r\ngod no matter what is going on around one. If one is either attracted or av=\r\nerse to any one thing, that is enough to block self-realization.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DA=\r\nrial size=3D2&gt;However, if one is weak, it is better to stay away from vaama=\r\nachaara.

Similarly, one who wants self-realization using this path will fal=\r\nl if one does not have perfect self-control.
