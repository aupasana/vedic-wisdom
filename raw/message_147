It is a \nsacred day that is celebrate=\r\nd with great enthusiasm and joy by Hindus \nthroughout the world. Deepavali =\r\nis observed to celebrate the return \nof Lord Sri Rama (a divine avatara, or=\r\n incarnation, of God) to His \ncapitol city of Ayodhya after being in exile =\r\nfor many years.  In \norder to celebrate the return of their Lord and King, =\r\nthe residents \nof Ayodhya lit millions of ghee lamps to light the way for S=\r\nri Rama&#39;s \nreturn to His kingdom, and to inaugurate the beginning of the re=\r\nign \nof Ramarajya, or perfect Dharma Government on earth.  Thus, the power =\r\n\nof light is always associated with this important Hindu festival. The \nday=\r\n is celebrated with people lighting lamps in temples, homes, and \npublic pl=\r\naces. Sri Lakshmi Puja is also performed in the evening to \nseek the divine=\r\n blessings of Sri Lakshmi Devi, the Goddess of \nAbundance and consort of Sr=\r\niman Narayana.\n\nMay the blessings of Sri Rama, of Srimati Lakshmi Devi, and=\r\n of Sriman \nNarayana be bestowed upon you, your family, and upon all sentie=\r\nnt \nbeings.  Shubh Deepavali.  \n\nJaya Sri Rama,\n\nSri Dharma Pravartaka Acha=\r\nrya\n(Dr. Frank Morales, Ph.D.)\n\nhttp://www.dharmacentral.com\n\nhttp://groups=\r\n.yahoo.com/group/drmoraleslist/\n\n\n\n"}}
