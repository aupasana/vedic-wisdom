All the papers are =\r\nfrom the most accepted and reputed scientific journals. There is no confusi=\r\non. Which is why I said, it is myth that vegeterian foods are easier to dig=\r\nest, if digestibility is the criteria. \n \nFurther, in my experience, I neve=\r\nr found traditional vegeterians to be any more dull or smarter than traditi=\r\nonal omnivores. \n \n(7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Animals have their own v=\r\naasanas and their needs. If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good.=\r\n Otherwise, feed the poor fellow whatever he/she needs.\n \nAn animal has a s=\r\npecific physical structure and needs to maintain the same. But if trained t=\r\nhey can &#39;adjust&#39; to any kind of meals. I have seen people feeding vegeteria=\r\nn diets to dogs. Statistically speaking, an animal whose whole body structu=\r\nre is designed to be a carnivore, may adjust to any food for the sake of su=\r\nrvival, but will become internally weak and susceptable to disease and weak=\r\nnesses. Who takes the karma for the disease and weakness that may result fr=\r\nom an unnatural diet to an animal? \n \nNot that all dogs who are feed a veg =\r\ndiet end up being diseased, but the chances increase a lot. It is like not =\r\nall smokers die of cancer, but smoking makes one susceptible to cancer. It =\r\nincreases the probability. Therefore my personal opinion is that an animal =\r\nif kept at home, it should taken care of in the best way possible, providin=\r\ng it with whatever maybe needed, including the right diet.\n \n \n____________=\r\n___\n \n \nA question for you.\n \nScientists studying evolution and human body =\r\nstructures have concluded that meat eating along with cropping and fruits h=\r\nas been prevelant since at least 4 million years. That, without a diet whic=\r\nh was omnivorous, the structure of the human stomach (lack of a developed c=\r\naecum), and the threefold increase in brain size (from archeological eviden=\r\nces) could never have been what it is today. Which means, an omnivorous die=\r\nt has been a natural process, so ingrained that it has changed the very str=\r\nucture of the human body. This cannot be done consciously, but only by the =\r\nwork of natural forces. (Again, if you want, I will provide relevent resear=\r\nch papers to prove my claim).\n \nWhat is your take on this? \n \n-Regards\n Raj=\r\narshi\n \n&quot;Between me and You, there is only me.

A few quick comments.\n\n(1) We are we we eat. Production of va=\r\nrious chemicals in our body and their interactions, are controlled by what =\r\nwe eat. Thus, what we eat has a profound impact on us.\n\n(2) Much has been w=\r\nritten on the material benefits from vegetarianism. But that is not all. Th=\r\nere are spiritual and subtle reasons as well.\n\nEating the flesh or body par=\r\nts of an animal that strongly identifies with the physical body entails a k=\r\narma. Self-identification of plants with their physical body is much subtle=\r\nr and the karma entailed in eating plant-based foods is much smaller.\n\nEspe=\r\ncially these days, very cruel methods are used for meat production by corpo=\r\nrations and animals are treated very cruelly. Part of the karma for their s=\r\nuffering goes to the ones benefiting from their meat.\n\n(3) I heard an inter=\r\nview with a scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) several months back. T=\r\nhey conducted an experiment on gorillas. One set of gorillas was fed with m=\r\neat. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After several months, res=\r\nearchers found a gap in the intelligence of the two sets. The ones fed with=\r\n meat were duller.\n\nTheir theory was that digestion of meat takes up more e=\r\nnergy. Gorillas fed with nuts and fruits may have diverted more energy towa=\r\nrds the development of brain. Though they were not sure if the same thing a=\r\npplies to human beings or not, a balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maxim=\r\nize one&#39;s intellectual development.\n\n(4) After we eat a heavy meal, we may =\r\nfeel dull or sleepy and cannot focus well on work that requires alertness a=\r\nnd skill. That is because the digestive process is using up a lot of energy=\r\n (also known as agni or fire) and there isn&#39;t much agni available for other=\r\n activities such as digestion of intellectual ideas that happens in the min=\r\nd. Similarly, digestion of spiritual ideas/experiences also requires agni a=\r\nnd that cannot happen well. That is why meditation or homam after a heavy m=\r\neal are fruitless and we are normally advised to do sadhana before eating.\n=\r\n\n(5) If foods that light up a higher digestive agni (e.g. meats, deep fried=\r\n food with more oil, spicy foods that stimulate digestive agni etc) are con=\r\nsumed more frequently, agni is diverted towards digestion more often and th=\r\nere is less agni available for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual idea=\r\ns and experiences. If one eats saattwik food that is very easy to digest (s=\r\nimple grains, simple lentils and simple vegetables, all softly cooked with =\r\nmild spices, and fruits), less agni is diverted towards digestion and more =\r\nagni is available for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and exp=\r\neriences.\n\n(6) Even a big fire cannot burn wet grass well. But huge stacks =\r\nof dry grass may be burnt by just one spark! Similarly, little bit of inter=\r\nnal fire may be enough to assimilate spiritual ideas and experiences in a p=\r\nerson with excellent vaasanas and few obstructions (dry grass). A lot of in=\r\nternal fire may be needed in a person with poor vaasanas and many obstructi=\r\nons (wet grass). Thus, it all depends on vaasanas and impurities in nadis a=\r\nnd chakras.\n\nOne person may eat meat and deep fried foods, spend a lot of a=\r\ngni on digesting them and yet make excellent spiritual progress. Another pe=\r\nrson may eat saattwik food, maximize the agni available for spiritual trans=\r\nformation and yet struggle to progress spiritually. However, the best cours=\r\ne of action for one is to ignore counter-examples and be a vegetarian. All =\r\nother things being equal, that maximizes the agni available for spiritual p=\r\nrogress.\n\n(7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Animals have their own vaasanas a=\r\nnd their needs. If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwis=\r\ne, feed the poor fellow whatever he/she needs.\n\n(8) One should eat to live =\r\nand not live to eat. A yogi should consume enough food to sustain oneself s=\r\no that one can fulfil one&#39;s dharma in the material world using physical bod=\r\ny and make spiritual progress. Eating too much food is not good for spiritu=\r\nal sadhana.\n\nInstead of overeating most of the time and fasting on specific=\r\n days, it is better to eat limited amount always. Regular practices are mor=\r\ne important for transformation and success, than occasional practices.\n\n(9)=\r\n By merely thinking that god is the doer of all actions or considering food=\r\n to be god&#39;s prasad, one cannot escape the karma involved. It depends on ho=\r\nw deeply ingrained that thought is and how deeply one feels so. If one inte=\r\nrnally feels 100% that god is acting through one and whatever one is doing =\r\n(e.g. eating) is just god&#39;s prasad to one, then one is free.\n\nBest regards,=\r\n\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------------------------\nFree =\r\nJyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; =\r\nritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.vedicastrologe=\r\nr.org/\nFilms that make a difference: http://saraswatifilms.org/ \nSpirituali=\r\nty: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nJyotish writings: http://gro=\r\nups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n---------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------\n\n\n\n \n\n\n      \r\n--0-710799573-1291240981=:98049\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-siz=\r\ne:18pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gentlemen,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0)=\r\n; font-size: 24px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; background-co=\r\nlor: transparent; font-style: normal; &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;I=\r\n have been reading these messages with great interest. &nbsp;My take on veg=\r\netarian vs non vegetarian food has to be about ahimsa. &nbsp;Basically we d=\r\no not want to impart undue suffering on other living entities unless it is =\r\nabsolutely necessary for our survival and it should be our last resort. &nb=\r\nsp;I prefer and am a vegetarian solely on this consideration. &nbsp;The las=\r\nt time I checked nearly 200000 cattle per day are slaughtered for human con=\r\nsumption in the US.

Therefore my personal opinion is that an animal if kept at home, it =\r\nshould taken care of in the best way possible, providing it with whatever m=\r\naybe needed, including the right diet.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\n/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font siz=\r\ne=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;_______________&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;A quest=\r\nion for you.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;f=\r\nont size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;Scientists studying evolution and human body structures have=\r\n concluded that meat eating along with cropping and fruits has been prevela=\r\nnt since at least 4 million years. That, without a diet which was omnivorou=\r\ns, the structure of the human stomach (lack of a developed&nbsp;caecum),&nb=\r\nsp;and the threefold increase in&nbsp;brain size (from archeological eviden=\r\nces)&nbsp;could never have been what it is today. Which means, an omnivorou=\r\ns diet has been a&nbsp;natural process, so ingrained that it has changed th=\r\ne very structure of the human body. This cannot be done consciously, but on=\r\nly by the work of natural forces. (Again, if you want, I will provide relev=\r\nent research&nbsp;papers to prove my claim).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=\r\n=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;What is your take on this?=\r\n &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D=\r\n&quot;3&quot;&gt;-Regards&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;font-size: 10pt; color: navy; font-family: Verdana; &quot; class=3D&quot;yui_3=\r\n_2_0_6_1291240455796168&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; s=\r\nize=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&quot;Between me and You, there is only me. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/s=\r\ntrong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot; color=3D&quot;=\r\n#000000&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv1599468630MsoNormal&quot; style=3D&quot;f=\r\nont-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; &quot;&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv1599468630MsoNormal&quot; sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; &quot;&gt;Take away the me, so only You remai=\r\nn&quot; - Hallaj&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-size: 18pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new y=\r\nork&#39;, times, serif; &quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-size: 12pt; border-left-color=\r\n: rgb(16, 16, 255); border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; font-=\r\nfamily: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; &quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Tahoma=\r\n&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;hr&quot; style=3D&quot;border-top-width: 1px; border-righ=\r\nt-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; border-top-=\r\nstyle: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border=\r\n-left-style: solid; border-top-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); border-right-colo=\r\nr: rgb(204, 204, 204); border-bottom-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); border-left=\r\n-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); line-height: 0; font-size: 0px; margin-top: 5px=\r\n; margin-bottom: 5px; font-family: Tahoma; &quot; readonly=3D&quot;true&quot; contentedita=\r\nble=3D&quot;false&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; =\r\nNarasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:=\r\nbold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FON=\r\nT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Thu, 2 December, 2010 12:48:03 AM&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; [vedic-wisdom] Food we =\r\neat&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1599468630ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;div&gt;Namaste friends,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There has been a lot of discussion on food. A =\r\nfew quick comments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1) We are we we eat. Production of various chem=\r\nicals in our body and their interactions, are controlled by what we eat. Th=\r\nus, what we eat has a profound impact on us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(2) Much has been writt=\r\nen on the material benefits from vegetarianism. But that is not all. There =\r\nare spiritual and subtle reasons as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eating the flesh or body p=\r\narts of an animal that strongly identifies with the physical body entails a=\r\n karma. Self-identification of plants with their physical body is much subt=\r\nler and the karma entailed in eating plant-based foods is much smaller.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;Especially these days, very cruel methods are used for meat production =\r\nby corporations and animals are treated very cruelly. Part of the karma for=\r\n their suffering goes to the ones benefiting from their meat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(3) I =\r\nheard an interview with a scientist on NPR (National Public Radio)\n several=\r\n months back. They conducted an experiment on gorillas. One set of gorillas=\r\n was fed with meat. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After seve=\r\nral months, researchers found a gap in the intelligence of the two sets. Th=\r\ne ones fed with meat were duller.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their theory was that digestion of=\r\n meat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed with nuts and fruits may have dive=\r\nrted more energy towards the development of brain. Though they were not sur=\r\ne if the same thing applies to human beings or not, a balanced vegetarian d=\r\niet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellectual development.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(4) After w=\r\ne eat a heavy meal, we may feel dull or sleepy and cannot focus well on wor=\r\nk that requires alertness and skill. That is because the digestive process =\r\nis using up a lot of energy (also known as agni or fire) and there isn&#39;t mu=\r\nch agni available for other activities such as digestion of intellectual id=\r\neas that happens in the mind. Similarly, digestion of\n spiritual ideas/expe=\r\nriences also requires agni and that cannot happen well. That is why meditat=\r\nion or homam after a heavy meal are fruitless and we are normally advised t=\r\no do sadhana before eating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(5) If foods that light up a higher dige=\r\nstive agni (e.g. meats, deep fried food with more oil, spicy foods that sti=\r\nmulate digestive agni etc) are consumed more frequently, agni is diverted t=\r\nowards digestion more often and there is less agni available for assimilari=\r\nng intellectual and spiritual ideas and experiences. If one eats saattwik f=\r\nood that is very easy to digest (simple grains, simple lentils and simple v=\r\negetables, all softly cooked with mild spices, and fruits), less agni is di=\r\nverted towards digestion and more agni is available for assimilaring intell=\r\nectual and spiritual ideas and experiences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(6) Even a big fire cann=\r\not burn wet grass well. But huge stacks of dry grass may be burnt by just o=\r\nne spark! Similarly, little bit of internal\n fire may be enough to assimila=\r\nte spiritual ideas and experiences in a person with excellent vaasanas and =\r\nfew obstructions (dry grass). A lot of internal fire may be needed in a per=\r\nson with poor vaasanas and many obstructions (wet grass). Thus, it all depe=\r\nnds on vaasanas and impurities in nadis and chakras.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One person may =\r\neat meat and deep fried foods, spend a lot of agni on digesting them and ye=\r\nt make excellent spiritual progress. Another person may eat saattwik food, =\r\nmaximize the agni available for spiritual transformation and yet struggle t=\r\no progress spiritually. However, the best course of action for one is to ig=\r\nnore counter-examples and be a vegetarian. All other things being equal, th=\r\nat maximizes the agni available for spiritual progress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(7) Regardin=\r\ng Priya&#39;s question: Animals have their own vaasanas and their needs. If an =\r\nanimal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor fello=\r\nw whatever he/she needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(8)\n One should eat to live and not live to=\r\n eat. A yogi should consume enough food to sustain oneself so that one can =\r\nfulfil one&#39;s dharma in the material world using physical body and make spir=\r\nitual progress. Eating too much food is not good for spiritual sadhana.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;Instead of overeating most of the time and fasting on specific days, it=\r\n is better to eat limited amount always. Regular practices are more importa=\r\nnt for transformation and success, than occasional practices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(9) By=\r\n merely thinking that god is the doer of all actions or considering food to=\r\n be god&#39;s prasad, one cannot escape the karma involved. It depends on how d=\r\neeply ingrained that thought is and how deeply one feels so. If one interna=\r\nlly feels 100% that god is acting through one and whatever one is doing (e.=\r\ng. eating) is just god&#39;s prasad to one, then one is free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best regar=\r\nds,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;-------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---&lt;br&gt;Free Jyotish Software,\n Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;&quot;=\r\nDo It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;http:/=\r\n/www.vedicastrologer.org/&lt;br&gt;Films that make a difference: http://saraswati=\r\nfilms.org/ &lt;br&gt;Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;br&gt;=\r\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;br&gt;--------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\n      &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-710799573-1291240981=:98049--\r\n\n"}}
