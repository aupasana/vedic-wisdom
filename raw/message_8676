However, it is quit=\r\ne useful to continue thinking like this.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Kundalini is a container f=\r\nor one&#39;s ego. When grosser elements of one&#39;s ego are overcome, Kundalini ma=\r\ny become awakened and rise. But, that throws up new (and bigger) challenges=\r\n. Some subtler aspects of one&#39;s ego may become so inflated that it may beco=\r\nme very difficult to overcome them! Any inflation of ego will eventually bl=\r\nock Kundalini from rising further and meeting the Lord.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; This is why=\r\n I keep emphasizing that experiences are not to be chased. As one becomes i=\r\nnternally pure, an experience may come by itself. Though it may be triggere=\r\nd by environmental factors such as place/time/company, it comes essentially=\r\n due to one&#39;s own purity. However, a tangible experience or a Kundalini awa=\r\nkening is only the beginning. One needs to exercise a lot of self-control t=\r\no not let it sidetrack one in the long run and to keep making progress.\n&gt; =\r\n=A0\n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; A few days ba=\r\nck, I had the privilege of meeting a very learned sishya of a great master.=\r\n He said that he sought experiences when young, but realized later that one=\r\n is better off without them. An experience when one is not completely capab=\r\nle of digesting it can cause ego inflation that can be very difficult to ov=\r\nercome. One is better off doing one&#39;s dharma, paying off one&#39;s rinas and in=\r\ncreasing one&#39;s detachment in actions.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Until one has real Kundalini awakening, one wi=\r\nth a desire for Kundalini awakening may mistaken various other things for i=\r\nt. But, WHEN (IF) one has a real Kundalini awakening, one will have no doub=\r\nts and know what it is. It will be a highly tangible and clear event. A jol=\r\nt of 20,000 volts of physical electricity as you say. When prana and apana =\r\ncome together for the first time, it will be an explosion like a hydrogen b=\r\nomb. It will be unmistakable.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; However, one cannot replicate it by j=\r\nust thinking about it or imagining it, just as one cannot get a plant by pl=\r\nanting the plastic replica of a seed. If one does sadhana and increases int=\r\nernal purity, it will eventually happen. There is no short cut.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; BTW=\r\n, any members experiencing Kundalini awakening need to take care of their p=\r\nhysical health for a few months after that. Though it is basically an event=\r\n in the subtle body, it affects physical body too. The equilibrium of the n=\r\nervous system may be shaken. While new equilibrium is established, it is ve=\r\nry very useful to stick to sattwik diet.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Swami Sathasivom was in greater Boston two =\r\nyears back and did 1,000 Chandi homas during a 3-month period. He was basic=\r\nally doing one homam after another throughout the day and then sleeping. He=\r\n did like that for about 3 months! The sankalpa was impersonal and for esta=\r\nblishing dharma in the world. After that exercise, he got a sankalpa to est=\r\nablish 12 temples in US where people can come and worship. The one in Santa=\r\n Clara that you visited is one of them. He spent some time there in the pas=\r\nt, doing sadhana.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; If any of you have the opportunity to meet him wh=\r\nen he visits the temple again, do try to meet him. He is such a simple, chi=\r\nldlike and pure sadhaka. He is quite service-minded, humble and devoted. Pr=\r\niests like him are so rare now-a-days. If you meet him, you will understand=\r\n what I mean.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; BTW, he asked me several months back to visit this Sa=\r\nnta Clara temple at my convenience and do a Satya Narayana pooja there. Hop=\r\nefully, that can happen soon and I can meet a few of you living in that are=\r\na, Mother willing.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrology=\r\n & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; --------\n&gt; =A0\n=\r\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; On Mon, Sep 10, 2012 at 11:12 AM, vemparlaramkishore wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Na=\r\nmaste \n&gt; \n&gt; I came to know previously of Swami Sathsivom&#39;s work by Narasimh=\r\na ji&#39;s writings.Below is one of the original messages from Narasimha ji abo=\r\nut how the Divine mother gave the vision of starting Mahaganapati homam whe=\r\nn Narasimha ji and Manish ji were at the Kalikambal temple in Chennai. \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/556\n&gt; \n&gt; Swami Sathsiv=\r\nom recently consecrated a Shiva temple in San Jose california along with th=\r\ne deities of Pratyangira Devi and I had the good fortune of visiting it yes=\r\nterday. \n&gt; \n&gt; http://srimahakalmandir.org/\n&gt; \n&gt; http://vimeo.com/45322018\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; It is with tears of gratitude that I write this...have no other way to =\r\nput it in words ...for the first time in in life was blown away through a p=\r\nhysical experience of the divine in the Sri Pratyangira shrine.
