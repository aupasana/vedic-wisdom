But since this is a debate and just a debate, =C3=82=C2=A0let me =\r\nput forth some logical points.=C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; 1) Two wro=\r\nngs never make a right. This is one mistake we Indians do when we try to de=\r\nbate over something. When we are discussing Tulasidasji, it does not matter=\r\n whether Ramakrishna - who lived in a different century - was right or now.=\r\n That would be a different debate. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; 2) Ramakrishna did=\r\n not write anything -:). He only=C3=82=C2=A0woke up=C3=82=C2=A0people to wh=\r\nat ever degree was necessary and gave general talks on spirituality. So, on=\r\ne can always contend that a mistake maybe the biographers mistake. M or Sar=\r\nadananda=C3=82=C2=A0could very well have been mistaken in what he quoted. G=\r\niving a freewheeling talk is different from creating a composition. When on=\r\ne writes, one has more time and energy to indulge in thinking, and checking=\r\n up possibilities of different shades of meanings for the simple reason tha=\r\nt the audience is large, unknown and spread out=C3=82=C2=A0over huge spans =\r\nof time.=C3=82=C2=A0When one talks, and that too talking to friends, or clo=\r\nse people, one does not need to be careful of every word or sentence one sp=\r\neaks. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; To understand this better,=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0we have to think - scientifically speaking - how communication happens i=\r\nn three levels. Around 33 percent of the communication is through the words=\r\n, 64 percent through body language and a solid 3 percent is &#39;unknown&#39; or su=\r\nb conscious communication. This last three percent is the most powerful. Wh=\r\nen a person can use this 3 percent of sub conscious communication - he can =\r\nmove masses of people. All great leaders do so. All rock stars also do so (=\r\nIMO). If you listen to the lyrics of an average rock music, you may find it=\r\n uninspiring. But if you were to be present in a live rock concert, you wil=\r\nl definitely feel an energy and get swayed.=C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Then comes body language which is so important.=C3=82=C2=A0For example,=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0if you enter a Govt office in India, you may find that the babu=\r\ns there will be sitting relaxed in their chair with their spine reclining. =\r\nWhatever you say will hardly make any impact on them. That is why the files=\r\n in Govt. of India offices move at a=C3=82=C2=A0snail&#39;s pace.=C3=82=C2=A0If=\r\n you find that someone whom you are talking to=C3=82=C2=A0is sitting cross =\r\nlegged on a chair, with left leg crossing the right, even if the person may=\r\n hang on eagerly to every word you speak, know it for the sure that there i=\r\ns a strong change he is listening through one ear and throwing out the word=\r\ns through the other. In short, pretending to listen. In effect, once you le=\r\nave his presence he probably=C3=82=C2=A0won&#39; t bother about what you said.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; And last is spoken word. When two people speak with ea=\r\nch other, both words and body language come into picture. Sometimes sub con=\r\nscious communication too can happen. Therefore there is a LOT of the energy=\r\n exchanged/communica tion not through words but through other means. \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; When you write down something, body languages gets negated=\r\n. Therefore, one needs to be extra cautious while writing something in orde=\r\nr to convey the correct sense. That is why there are so many more rules to =\r\nbe followed=C3=82=C2=A0for writing anything.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; So theref=\r\nore, if Ramakrishna is &quot;talking&quot; to someone he is probably communicating us=\r\ning all means possible. But if he were to write a book and mention &quot;Kamini =\r\nand Kanchan&quot; without further explanation of what he intends to mean, then h=\r\ne too can be called to question. But he never wrote any books, and the auth=\r\nors who did, made sure they explained the sense. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Cont=\r\nrast this to that line from Ramacharit Manas, without any qualifications, t=\r\nhat implies &quot;women&quot;, &quot;sudra&quot;, &quot;pashu&quot; are worthy of &quot;tadan&quot;.=C3=82=C2=A0 If=\r\n I were a woman, I would take offense=C3=82=C2=A0to that line.=C3=82=C2=A0 =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; 3) Whenever I am doing a critic of a religious litera=\r\nture, I keep the Koran as a standard. By this I mean, whenever I am judging=\r\n a book of religious nature, I follow the same parameters of judgement that=\r\n I use when I judge the Koran as a book.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; The Koran con=\r\ntains a verse, translated correctly in the M.A. Shakir and Dawood translati=\r\nons, which recommend husbands to beat their wives if the wives are disobedi=\r\nent. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Men are the maintainers of women because A=\r\nllah has made some of them to excel others and because they spend out of th=\r\neir property; the good women are therefore obedient, guarding the unseen as=\r\n Allah has guarded; and (as to) those on whose part you fear desertion, adm=\r\nonish them, and leave them alone in their sleeping places and beat them; th=\r\nen if they obey you, do not seek a way against them; surely Allah is High, =\r\nGreat. (Shakir&#39;s version of the Koran, Quran, 4:34) \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; A=\r\n lot of muslims I have talked to, defend the above=C3=82=C2=A0giving variou=\r\ns reasons one of which is &#39;misunderstanding context&#39;. I find it inexcusable=\r\n. Same way a line in a religious book bracketing &quot;nari&quot;, &quot;pashu&quot;, &quot;sudra&quot; t=\r\nogether, I find=C3=82=C2=A0to be equally inexcusable. That is the sense tha=\r\nt comes out from a normal reading of that line. I am not commenting on the =\r\nwhole of Ramcharit Manas, but that one vital line.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; [Pr=\r\nem, Ahinsa], Satya Vachan aur=C3=82=C2=A0Par-stri Matusamaan|\n&gt; &gt; Inase aga=\r\nr prabhu na mile to Tulasi Juth Jabaan ||\n&gt; &gt; (I have given=C3=82=C2=A0this=\r\n doha =C3=82=C2=A0out of memory and its quite possible that first two=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0wrods are wrong in the doha )=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Intere=\r\nsting doha.

Let me try again. He is not really saying that Sri Rama was not a sel=\r\nf realized man. Infact he quite agrees that Sri Rama was an Avatar of God. =\r\nWhat he says is that, (his opinion)=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0God did not d=\r\nescend as Sri Rama in order to be worshipped. He descended in order to lead=\r\n by example. That is why the text is called Rama+ayana. A path that an ordi=\r\nnary man can and should follow. One of principles.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0 Compare this to the name of the other great epic, Mahabharata, which wa=\r\ns not named &quot;Krishna+ayana&quot; . One cannot follow Krishna&#39;s path. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Whenever, according to him, we attribute God=\r\nhood to Sri Rama, our subcsious mind will create a blockage, a divide betwe=\r\nen the worshipper and the worshipped and thus make it impossible to lead a =\r\nlife like Rama did. BUt if we try to look at it like the story of a great k=\r\ning, a nobel man, a devoted husband etc, we have a better chance of followi=\r\nng such a life.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; An ordinary man cannot lead the life of a God but he =\r\ncan follow the life of a great man.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Similarly, even today lot of people advise that one should try to become l=\r\nike Vivekananda, or that this country needs its youth to be like Vivekanada=\r\ns in teh future. It does not mean Vivekanada was not a self realized=C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0saint of highest calibre, but his life&#39;s image is like=\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0one who=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0lived like a l=\r\nion among sheep of ordinary=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0men, fearless and unc=\r\nompromising and principled. If every=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0person would=\r\n constantly think that Vivekanada was a saint=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0who=\r\n worked by the pwoer of a deity or due to his extreme spirituality or the b=\r\nlessing of a great guru,=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0no one will ever make an=\r\n attempt to be inspired by him or=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0emulate his way=\r\n of living.Vivekanada was a spiritual giant, but=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\nthe image he projected was one of a tireless, fearless KarmaYogi. THAT can =\r\ninspire people. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0On the other hand=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0you will never hear an=\r\nyone advising that one should try to lead a life like Ramarkishna.=C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0That is impossible. He=C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0 was God incarnate leading a charmed life.=C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Similar is the case=\r\n with the Avatar called Sri=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0Ramachandra incompari=\r\nson to Sri Krishna. One can become Rama in actions but one can never=C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0become Krishna. Therefore, my friend believes, one sho=\r\nuld not consider Rama as a God to be worshipped, but as a model to be follo=\r\nwed.

He said, Sri Rama had mastery of all=\r\n divine weapons. He could have destroyed Ravana and his whole army in a bli=\r\nnk of an eye, right from the place where he was=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=\r\n=A1=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0located when he first heard the news of Sita&#39;=\r\ns abduction, but Rama did not do so and instead chose the hard way of destr=\r\noying Ravana - the human way. So as per my friend, it is more important to =\r\nemulate Rama&#39;s ideas than to worship Rama.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=E2=82=\r\n=AC=C5=A1=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3) He considers the Ramcharit =\r\nManas, from a literary angle, a hodgepodge of langauges and styles ranging =\r\nfrom Awadhi to BrajBhasa. An author&#39;s paradise (since many rules of composi=\r\ntion has been flouted) but a critics nightmare. Also, there is a line in th=\r\nere which equates women with animals or something similar. He believes that=\r\n was introduces in the text because Tulasidas had a problem controlling his=\r\n own lust. Therefore, he ended up composing a sentence derogatory to women.=\r\n Further, he argues that if Sri Rama is worshipped as God, then the purpose=\r\n of his Avatarhood goes waste. Sri Rama was there to explain idea way of li=\r\nfe. Krishna was there to be worshipped because Krishna was maximum ability =\r\nof God on this plane.

As I said, he has an uncompromising attitude when it comes to fi=\r\nnding out the truth about anything. By education, he is a Phd is mathematic=\r\ns. He has worked in different fields, from banking to education to journali=\r\nsm. He did not last for long in most places. He speaks and writes fluently,=\r\n English, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he i=\r\ns learning Tamil. He composes poetry in all the above languages. When he wa=\r\ns in college, he considered himself an atheist. While applying for a job he=\r\n had kept the place makered for religion as blank. When\n&gt;  the clerk who wa=\r\ns supposed to take the forms\n&gt; &gt; saw that blank space,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he asked\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; my friend&#39;s name. Hearing a Hindu name, the clerk wrote &quot;Hindu&quot;. Seeing =\r\nthis, my friend snatched the form from the clerk and tore it up right there=\r\n. Because, he considered himself an atheist and writing Hindu in the form w=\r\nould have been a lie. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1=C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So this gives a basic idea of the man I am speaking=\r\n of.

His way to of=\r\nfice passed by a Krishna temple. As he was passing by in=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=E2=\r\n=82=AC=C5=A1=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0his scooter, suddenly he felt a stra=\r\nnge urge to go into the temple. He says he still does not know why he went =\r\ninside the temple, but he did. That was at 9 o clock in the morning. Next w=\r\nhen he sees his watch it is 4:30 in the evening! And he has no knowledge of=\r\n how the time went. When he asked the priest, the priest said that he went =\r\ninto the temple sat down and just stayed as he was for the whole time witho=\r\nut any movement. The priest somehow felt scared to disturb him. But my frie=\r\nnd had no idea why this happened. He remembered nothing, as if he was in de=\r\nep sleep.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then he started meditating at home, and it was there=C3=83=C6&#39;=\r\n=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0that he got visions etc of =\r\nKrishna. He does not say much about these, infact most people who know him =\r\nalso do not know these things. But once he was in samadhi for 72 hours, not=\r\n moving from his meditation seat, in the exact same place and same position=\r\n for 3 days continuously.=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0 Only his wife and close relatives know about this incident. I bel=\r\nieve nowadays when ever he sits for meditation he often enters the state of=\r\n Samadhi. When someone asked him how he felt during samadhi, he just said i=\r\nt feels as if the whole universe orginates from me. I am the sun, the moon,=\r\n the stars, the planets, the animals, men, women, children, the wind, the w=\r\nater, the space, smaller than the atom and bigger than everything.

But a God cannot be emulated by ordinary men. One cannot be=\r\ncome Krishna, but one=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0can try to lead his life like Rama. I have argued with him over this,=\r\n but I am merely stating his idea. Also he does not have a Guru - a human g=\r\nuru at least, and advises people to not trust most Gurus these days. Needle=\r\nss to say, he is not an atheist any more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=\r\n=C5=A1=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Later he had once=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=\r\n=E2=82=AC=C5=A1=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0mentioned he knew the relation he=\r\n had with all the people around him in his past lives.
