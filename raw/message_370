Who are we =\r\n..\n&gt; to worry about others? They, their god and their gurus will feel \n&gt; so=\r\nrry for them and do something about them. Apne ko kya lena dena? We \n&gt; are =\r\nfirst responsible for ourselves. When one cannot change self and \n&gt; focus a=\r\nttention on god fully within oneself, what is the point in \n&gt; lamenting abo=\r\nut the spirituality or lack of it in other people? ...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Here you made =\r\nme feel as if I did a mistake in responding to my \n&gt; cousin as well as aski=\r\nng you the questions. I might be wrong in both. \n&gt; But what I feel is thoug=\r\nh it might be irritating and meaningless to \n&gt; answer the queries of an agn=\r\nostic; we cannot override the chance of \n&gt; us being instrumental in their p=\r\nath to know the truth.\n \nI didn&#39;t mean to make you feel bad or to suggest t=\r\nhat one should not try to help others and focus on oneself. If I thought so=\r\n, I would not be doing so many things I do, like replying to mails, putting=\r\n together homam manuals etc. My comment 3 came after the first 2. I was jus=\r\nt trying to bring in another angle after the first two.\n \nOne cannot stop f=\r\nocussing inwards and correcting oneself ever. Even a yogi who is able to ch=\r\nange the spiritual lives of millions cannot drop guard and has to be lookin=\r\ng inwards. That was my point.\n \nIt is good to help others and try to be &quot;in=\r\nstrumental in their path to know the truth&quot;. However, after engaging in act=\r\nion that one&#39;s judgment says one should engage in, one should earnestly sur=\r\nrender the doership to the Lord and move on. It is not worthwhile to cling =\r\non to the ownership of too many actions for too long as people normally do.=\r\n In fact, it is a big problem. People don&#39;t realize it. One getting used to=\r\n cancer and living with it for 50 years may forget how it is to live withou=\r\nt that disease. Similarly, a being used to living with this cancer (of pers=\r\nistent mental ownership of many many many actions) for many lives may forge=\r\nt how it is to live without that disease!\n \nAfter all rituals like pooja an=\r\nd homam, we do say &quot;sarvam sree krishnaarpanamastu&quot;. Though people say it w=\r\nithout understanding, it means that you surrender the action finished just =\r\nnow to Krishna. After that, you are not the owner. You should really feel t=\r\nhat way.\n \nOne can adopt that attitude to everything in life, do the action=\r\n as perfectly as one can and then surrender the doership to the Lord. Unfor=\r\ntunately, many people do good things and cling on to the ownership within t=\r\nheir mind for too long. This causes many problems and also binds one. Pride=\r\n that they did something good or sadness that they missed something or happ=\r\niness that a good result came from that action or sadness that the intended=\r\n result did not happen start eating one&#39;s mind later on and stop the mind f=\r\nrom acting optimally on *future actions*. If one truly surrenders the owner=\r\nship of every action after the action finishes, one forms a distance betwee=\r\nn oneself and the results that the actions may bring later on. That distanc=\r\ne is really needed for a stable and blissful state of mind and optimum outp=\r\nut from one&#39;s mind.\n \n&gt; I remember reading in Scott Peck&#39;s book -The Roads =\r\nLess Travelled, \n&gt; that to lose ones ego and to realize oneself, an ego mus=\r\nt be present \n&gt; in the first place. I liked that statement very much becaus=\r\ne it is \n&gt; from his book that I am first reading a statement in that line o=\r\nf \n&gt; thought. Everywhere people condemn ego and speak of losing ego as the =\r\n\n&gt; way to realize God. But nobody has ever said that an ego is necessary \n&gt;=\r\n to lose it.\n \nQuite honestly, ego IS present in all beings by default, inc=\r\nluding the lowest beings like amoeba and bacteria. A discussion of the nece=\r\nssity of ego to be present is superfluous, as ego IS present anyway in all =\r\nbeings. By the way, ego in our literature does not mean &quot;egotism&quot; or self-i=\r\nmportance or pride (which are the meaning in which the word is used these d=\r\nays). Ego simply means self-consciousness and self-awareness. They are alwa=\r\nys there in all beings and it is an uphill climb to lose them by introspect=\r\ning each thought, word and action of oneself.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n---=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short =\r\nHomam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Your=\r\nself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.ya=\r\nhoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.ho=\r\nme.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n-------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------- \n \n--- In soham=\r\nsa@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jyothi_b_lakshmi&quot; &lt;jyothi_b_lakshmi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Re=\r\nspected Narasimhji,\n&gt; \n&gt; First of all let me thank you for spending some ti=\r\nme to reply to my \n&gt; questions.\n&gt; \n&gt; I specifically liked the below comment=\r\ns of yours:\n&gt; &quot;A mind is a mind is a mind. Mind creates the world, not nece=\r\nssarily \n&gt; a human mind. All minds can create a world. However, a human min=\r\nd is \n&gt; more capable than other minds to break down that created world and =\r\n\n&gt; return to the source. THAT is the point.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; May be the world we perce=\r\nive now is the creation of human mind, and \n&gt; as you said, there may be man=\r\ny other worlds created by many other \n&gt; minds other than that of humans and=\r\n since we are not the creators we \n&gt; are unable to see/comprehend them. \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &quot;Your question is kind of an oxymoron. Can good aghoris become &quot;well-\n&gt; =\r\nknown&quot; and come to limelight? :-)&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (I did not know the meaning of oxym=\r\noron. Had to look dictionary :((. \n&gt; Well, I understand your point. Aghoris=\r\n cannot be well-known for \n&gt; obvious reasons. May be Aghoris know that peop=\r\nle who are not as much \n&gt; evolved as them will not be able to understand th=\r\neir path and hence \n&gt; stay away from publicity.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I am least intereste=\r\nd in Vamamarga. I just had a curiosity to know if \n&gt; any body was successfu=\r\nl in that path. (Your reference to Vamamarga \n&gt; and its dangers made me thi=\r\nnk of the success rate of that path and if \n&gt; really such people existed. T=\r\nhat&#39;s all. (Personally, I DO NOT want \n&gt; any Aghori to appear as my Guru, t=\r\nhough I would wish a saint from \n&gt; Right hand path to appear before me IFF =\r\nand when I am eligible (if \n&gt; not in this birth, in any future birth)!!. Th=\r\nis is not biasing, just \n&gt; a personal taste. \n&gt; \n&gt; I enjoyed reading Aghora=\r\n -Kundalini- so well written and genuine. But \n&gt; as you said, the other boo=\r\nk on Left Hand Path by Swaboda was a kind \n&gt; of shock to me, initially. And=\r\n it was good to know that such paths \n&gt; also existed. But after that it did=\r\nn&#39;t affect me at all because I \n&gt; understood it is just another path. Why s=\r\nhould I bother about how and \n&gt; why it is so when we have a more acceptable=\r\n and beautiful path? \n&gt;  \n&gt; Now, I would like to reply to the 3rd comment o=\r\nf yours:\n&gt; &quot;(3) Actually, more than others, feel sorry for yourself. Who ar=\r\ne we \n&gt; to worry about others? They, their god and their gurus will feel \n&gt;=\r\n sorry for them and do something about them. Apne ko kya lena dena? We \n&gt; a=\r\nre first responsible for ourselves. When one cannot change self and \n&gt; focu=\r\ns attention on god fully within oneself, what is the point in \n&gt; lamenting =\r\nabout the spirituality or lack of it in other people? So, \n&gt; we should all =\r\ntry to look inward and take a critical look at \n&gt; ourselves, given that we =\r\ngot a very very very valuable life as a \n&gt; human being.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Here you made=\r\n me feel as if I did a mistake in responding to my \n&gt; cousin as well as ask=\r\ning you the questions. I might be wrong in both. \n&gt; But what I feel is thou=\r\ngh it might be irritating and meaningless to \n&gt; answer the queries of an ag=\r\nnostic; we cannot override the chance of \n&gt; us being instrumental in their =\r\npath to know the truth. Every person, \n&gt; who has a quest to find the truth,=\r\n be it spiritually or \n&gt; scientifically (as my cousin who says he will try =\r\nto solve the \n&gt; mystery of life in a scientific way) will have to under go =\r\na lot of \n&gt; conflicts at the initial stages. Since we are all accustomed to=\r\n find \n&gt; answers through reasoning, everybody initially starts thinking \n&gt; =\r\nlogically to get an answer which ultimately leads to a dead end. Once \n&gt; th=\r\nat way ends, one starts looking within, and after a lot of practice \n&gt; fina=\r\nlly realizes that what logic couldn&#39;t find, could be found by \n&gt; practice o=\r\nf concentrating within. This realization that nobody can \n&gt; answer ones que=\r\nstions, but only oneself, is achieved after a lot of \n&gt; queries which may b=\r\ne directed to oneself and to many. To my cousin, I \n&gt; may be a part of that=\r\n `many&#39;. It is not that I worry about others \n&gt; spirituality, but I feel, j=\r\nust as many people acted as catalyst in my \n&gt; spiritual journey, I too migh=\r\nt act a as a catalyst, to others, even \n&gt; if I don&#39;t have anything worthwhi=\r\nle to share, and even if I might not \n&gt; be aware of my role. My inability t=\r\no answer his question might be one \n&gt; reason that will catalyze his thought=\r\ns further to know more about \n&gt; other ways and may be, he will ultimately r=\r\nealize the truth. But till \n&gt; then, the path and people on that path are im=\r\nportant. I am saying \n&gt; this from my experience, when I was tortured by man=\r\ny spiritual quests \n&gt; and many people&#39;s answers (be it satisfactory or unsa=\r\ntisfactory) \n&gt; helped me to advance. So I feel it might be the same with ot=\r\nhers. \n&gt; \n&gt; I remember reading in Scott Peck&#39;s book -The Roads Less Travell=\r\ned, \n&gt; that to lose ones ego and to realize oneself, an ego must be present=\r\n \n&gt; in the first place. I liked that statement very much because it is \n&gt; f=\r\nrom his book that I am first reading a statement in that line of \n&gt; thought=\r\n. Everywhere people condemn ego and speak of losing ego as the \n&gt; way to re=\r\nalize God. But nobody has ever said that an ego is necessary \n&gt; to lose it.=\r\n Nobody ever spoke of the `necessity&#39; and importance of \n&gt; ego to realize G=\r\nod. Scott Peck made it very clear that if not having \n&gt; an ego is a sign of=\r\n realization, then all children should be self-\n&gt; realized yogis, but in fa=\r\nct they are not. They become yogis when they \n&gt; develop an ego and then los=\r\ne it. May be this is the way Divine Mother \n&gt; wants it to happen. Someway, =\r\nI liked what Scott Peck said. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; With Respects,\n&gt; Jyothi\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In =\r\nsohamsa@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Na=\r\nmaste Jyothi ji,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Secondly, can you please help me with a questi=\r\non? ..snip..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He was asking me if yoga, be it jnana yoga, bhakti yoga =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or any one, is the only way to attain moksha/realisation, then \n&gt; wh=\r\nat \n&gt; &gt; &gt; will other living organisms like ameoba, bacteria and all will do=\r\n \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; attain moksha? Arent they also living organisms? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ..sni=\r\np.. He said, if what I am saying is correct, only human \n&gt; beings \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wi=\r\nll be evolved and other organisms will never attain moksha. I \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n breathless for a moment and did not know how to answer him. I \n&gt; really \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; felt sad (and ashamed, because I thought I could answer all \n&gt; questio=\r\nns \n&gt; &gt; &gt; related to the mystery of life) that I couldnt answer \n&gt; him. ..s=\r\nnip..\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Well, sadhana (effort) is what a being does. Phala (fruits)=\r\n are \n&gt; decided by the Lord. If God wants, a bacteria can get moksha too. \n=\r\n&gt; However, *usually* god has some rules of action and reaction to \n&gt; uphold=\r\n and hence does not act out of order. So the chance of a \n&gt; baterium to get=\r\n moksha is negligible (except at the end of this \n&gt; creation cycle).\n&gt; &gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; It is indeed true that amoeba or bacteria have very very small \n&gt; chanc=\r\ne of moksha in THAT life. However, nobody stops them from doing \n&gt; some goo=\r\nd karma (possibly by *chance*), get a higher birth and \n&gt; eventually be bor=\r\nn as a human and do some sadhana.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; When I wrote &quot;by chance&quot;, it ma=\r\ny make some uncomfortable. But that \n&gt; is the fact. Whatever action we perf=\r\norm with a sense of *I-ness* \n&gt; behind that action becomes a karma (action)=\r\n and an equal and opposite \n&gt; phala (fruit/reaction) will come. Suppose one=\r\n donates one&#39;s eyes and \n&gt; feels good about the noble act and the person ge=\r\ntting the eyes uses \n&gt; the newly gotten vision to look at some beautiful wo=\r\nmen, be tempted \n&gt; and rape them, the donor will get part of that karma! Th=\r\ne laws of \n&gt; karma are complex. Thinking like &quot;this is a noble karma. So it=\r\n is \n&gt; good only&quot; is incorrect. Each action results in a series of \n&gt; devel=\r\nopments and begets some karma for the person. Of course, if an \n&gt; act is wi=\r\nth committed with ego but not an intention to affect a \n&gt; particular develo=\r\npment, the part of the karma begotten from that \n&gt; development is smaller (=\r\nthan it would be if that development was \n&gt; intended). Thus, even bacteria =\r\nand amoeba can beget karma from the \n&gt; results of their actions. But it is =\r\nvery small and accumulates \n&gt; slowly. Highly taamasik beings such as trees,=\r\n amoeba and bacteria \n&gt; take a looooong time to make progress on the ladder=\r\n of kaarmik \n&gt; evolution.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I want to make three comments:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; (1) One need not feel sorry for the amoeba and bacteria because \n&gt; they a=\r\nre mostly a long way from moksha. Not all beings need to get \n&gt; moksha righ=\r\nt away. If that is needed, god did not need to create this \n&gt; world. If the=\r\nre is unmanifested Brahman and nothing else in this \n&gt; universe, that will =\r\nsolve all problems. But the fact is that \n&gt; manifested Brahman with infinit=\r\ne objects at varying levels of karmic \n&gt; evolution is not really a problem!=\r\n That is exactly what is needed for \n&gt; the Lila to unfold.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; (2) If=\r\n you want to feel sorry, feel sorry not for amoeba and \n&gt; bacteria, but for=\r\n those who got the valuable human birth and yet act \n&gt; like amoeba and bact=\r\neria spiritually. Pity those who are stuck in the \n&gt; cycle of happiness and=\r\n sadness, elation and depression, hopes and \n&gt; despairs etc, without realiz=\r\ning that the play will end soon and what \n&gt; birth one will get next is unce=\r\nrtain!!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; (3) Actually, more than others, feel sorry for yourself. =\r\nWho are we \n&gt; to worry about others? They, their god and their gurus will f=\r\neel \n&gt; sorry for them and do something about them. Apne ko kya lena dena? W=\r\ne \n&gt; are first responsible for ourselves. When one cannot change self and \n=\r\n&gt; focus attention on god fully within oneself, what is the point in \n&gt; lame=\r\nnting about the spirituality or lack of it in other people? So, \n&gt; we shoul=\r\nd all try to look inward and take a critical look at \n&gt; ourselves, given th=\r\nat we got a very very very valuable life as a \n&gt; human being.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; H=\r\nis question gave me a sleepless night. I thought a lot about it. \n&gt; If \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; the whole world as a maya exist only in human&#39;s mind (as per my \n&gt; &gt; &gt; u=\r\nnderstanding, our mind creates this world, when through yoga, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mind/e=\r\ngo collapse happens, there is no world or anything and we \n&gt; &gt; &gt; submerge a=\r\ns oneness in the omnipotent power), if it is a creation \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mind, =\r\nthen there should not be any world when the human species \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; exti=\r\nnct. Right? \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; A mind is a mind is a mind. Mind creates the world, =\r\nnot necessarily \n&gt; a human mind. All minds can create a world. However, a h=\r\numan mind is \n&gt; more capable than other minds to break down that created wo=\r\nrld and \n&gt; return to the source. THAT is the point.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (I am askin=\r\ng you because, you were instrumental (though \n&gt; unknowingly) \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in open=\r\ning the wide horizon of spiritual knowledge to me years \n&gt; back \n&gt; &gt; &gt; thro=\r\nugh just one reply to one of my questions related to \n&gt; Kundalini. I \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n am always indebted to you for that and now I realise how stupid \n&gt; my \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; questions were at that time.) \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I am glad to know that. I am ac=\r\ntually a fool who does not know much \n&gt; and cannot help anyone. But the ble=\r\nssings of my gurus may work \n&gt; through me sometimes and benefit some.\n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; First: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I would like to know if you have heard of any vamachar=\r\nis in India \n&gt; who \n&gt; &gt; &gt; followed Vama Marga successfully and realised God=\r\n. All true \n&gt; saints I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have heard are followers of the Satwik path/r=\r\night hand tantra. So \n&gt; &gt; &gt; always wonder, did any body succeed in the othe=\r\nr way? Anybody who \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; well-known as a Vamamarga saint?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Your question is kind of an oxymoron. Can good aghoris become &quot;well-\n&gt; kno=\r\nwn&quot; and come to limelight? :-)\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I know one masterly aghori reasona=\r\nbly well. However, he is not \n&gt; restricted to one path. All paths are his o=\r\nwn and he does not \n&gt; distinguish. He does aghora sadhanas in smashana and =\r\nalso Vedic \n&gt; sadhanas like Vedic homas with the same attitude. He chants V=\r\nedic \n&gt; mantras too. For example, when he chants Sri Rudram, it produces \n&gt;=\r\n amazing energy all around. He is a bhakti yogi too. When he thinks of \n&gt; K=\r\nrishna, he melts in devotion. When he discusses upanishads and other \n&gt; Ved=\r\nanta texts such as Yoga Vaasishtham and BhagavadGita, his keen \n&gt; intellect=\r\n shines forth like a Sun and illuminates the thinking of a \n&gt; ready audienc=\r\ne. I have never seen anyone who has such a perfect \n&gt; understanding of the =\r\nessence of Upanishads and exudes it in thoughts, \n&gt; words and actions. He h=\r\nas wife and children, has a full-time job and \n&gt; engages in several externa=\r\nl activities and is never idle. But his \n&gt; level of detachment with the wor=\r\nk he does so expertly is far higher \n&gt; than even ascetics who renounce ever=\r\nything and *try* to develop some \n&gt; detachment.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Bottomline is tha=\r\nt he is an aghori, but he is also a jnaana yogi, \n&gt; bhakti yogi, karma yogi=\r\n and raaja yogi. He is a vaidika and he is an \n&gt; aghori. All paths are his =\r\nand he views all the same way. I don&#39;t know \n&gt; if all really good aghoris a=\r\nre like that or just he.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; In any case, it is irrelevant to you if =\r\nany aghori succeeded or \n&gt; not. If YOU are meant to succeed in aghota, you =\r\nwill. If not, you \n&gt; will not. To be safe, until the right time and right p=\r\nerson comes, \n&gt; one should not venture into aghora. I want people to apprec=\r\niate \n&gt; different things for what they are and not have unhealthy biases, b=\r\nut \n&gt; it does not mean everybody should try everything. Nuclear engineers \n=\r\n&gt; hating politicians, politicians hating lawyers and lawyers hating \n&gt; doct=\r\nors is bad. But one should become what one is supposed to!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; A fe=\r\nw years back, I had read AGHORA -Kundalini by Robert Svoboda. \n&gt; In \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nthat book one Aghori Vimalananda is mentioned. But except in that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bo=\r\nok, I couldnt find any references to this person anywhere. Not \n&gt; even \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; in net. (The only references were the ones related to Robert \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Swab=\r\noda&#39;s book and as his Guru).   \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Well, he guarded his privacy and =\r\nmade sure that the books came out \n&gt; only after he left the body. Moreover,=\r\n his real name was not that. \n&gt; Also, he led his spiritual life in relative=\r\n seclusion and not many \n&gt; knew him. No wonder you can&#39;t find info on him.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Bottomline is: Whether he is real or not, one can benefit from \n&gt;=\r\n teachings attributed to him. The knowledge present in the aghora \n&gt; series=\r\n of books is nothing short of amazing. It may shock you, but it \n&gt; can chan=\r\nge your thinking from inside out and give you a clearer \n&gt; understanding. V=\r\nimalananda not only managed to impart great \n&gt; understanding to Svoboda, bu=\r\nt also ensure that Mother Taaraa Herself \n&gt; would speak through Svoboda and=\r\n the knowledge would come out perfect. \n&gt; Other books authored by Svoboda m=\r\nay not have the same brilliance, but \n&gt; those books came out just as Vimala=\r\nnanda intended.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; There are many things in the book which could not=\r\n have come from a \n&gt; normal person. They came from someone who had a perfec=\r\nt, steady and \n&gt; unwavering understanding of the absolute truth.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nBTW, you cannot meet a good and genuine aghori unless there is a \n&gt; rina an=\r\nd *he* wants you to meet him.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ---=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Sh=\r\nort Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpa=\r\nnas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http=\r\n://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http=\r\n://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://=\r\nwww.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.=\r\nSriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------ \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; --- In sohamsa@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jyothi_b_lakshmi&quot; =\r\n\n&gt; &lt;jyothi_b_lakshmi@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimhji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Enjoyed reading both your mails.

All true \n&gt; saints I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have heard are followers=\r\n of the Satwik path/right hand tantra. So \n&gt; &gt; &gt; always wonder, did any bod=\r\ny succeed in the other way? Anybody who \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; well-known as a Vamam=\r\narga saint?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; A few years back, I had read AGHORA -Kundalini by =\r\nRobert Svoboda. \n&gt; In \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that book one Aghori Vimalananda is mentioned.=\r\n But except in that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; book, I couldnt find any references to this pers=\r\non anywhere. Not \n&gt; even \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in net.

He was asking me if yoga, be it jnana yoga, bhakti \n&gt; yoga \n&gt; &gt; &gt; or any=\r\n one, is the only way to attain moksha/realisation, then \n&gt; what \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wil=\r\nl other living organisms like ameoba, bacteria and all will do \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n attain moksha? Arent they also living organisms? (He has done his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; r=\r\nesearch in Bio Informatics, hence his priority to bacteria and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ameob=\r\na). He said, if what I am saying is correct, only human \n&gt; beings \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wi=\r\nll be evolved and other organisms will never attain moksha. I \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n breathless for a moment and did not know how to answer him. I \n&gt; really \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; felt sad (and ashamed, because I thought I could answer all \n&gt; questio=\r\nns \n&gt; &gt; &gt; related to the mystery of life) that I couldnt answer him. His \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; question seemed stupid, but when I thought of it, isnt that a \n&gt; valid=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; question?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; His question gave me a sleepless night. I th=\r\nought a lot about it. \n&gt; If \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the whole world as a maya exist only in =\r\nhuman&#39;s mind (as per my \n&gt; &gt; &gt; understanding, our mind creates this world, =\r\nwhen through yoga, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mind/ego collapse happens, there is no world or a=\r\nnything and we \n&gt; &gt; &gt; submerge as oneness in the omnipotent power), if it i=\r\ns a creation \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mind, then there should not be any world when the=\r\n human species \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; extinct.

Eve=\r\nry person, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; who has a quest to find the truth, be it \nspiritually o=\r\nr &lt;BR&gt;&gt; scientifically (as my cousin who says he will try to \nsolve the =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; mystery of life in a scientific way) will have to under go a \nlot =\r\nof &lt;BR&gt;&gt; conflicts at the initial stages. Since we are all accustomed to=\r\n \nfind &lt;BR&gt;&gt; answers through reasoning, everybody initially starts think=\r\ning \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; logically to get an answer which ultimately leads to a dead e=\r\nnd. Once \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; that way ends, one starts looking within, and after a lo=\r\nt of practice \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; finally realizes that what logic couldn&#39;t find, cou=\r\nld be found by \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; practice of concentrating within. This realization=\r\n that nobody can \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; answer ones questions, but only oneself, is achi=\r\neved after a lot of \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; queries which may be directed to oneself and =\r\nto many. To my cousin, I \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; may be a part of that `many&#39;. It is not =\r\nthat I worry about others \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; spirituality, but I feel, just as many =\r\npeople acted as catalyst in my \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; spiritual journey, I too might act=\r\n a as a catalyst, to others, even \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; if I don&#39;t have anything worthw=\r\nhile to share, and even if I might not \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; be aware of my role. My in=\r\nability to answer his question might be one \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; reason that will cata=\r\nlyze his thoughts further to know more about \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; other ways and may b=\r\ne, he will ultimately realize the truth. But till \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; then, the path =\r\nand people on that path are important. I am saying \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; this from my e=\r\nxperience, when I was tortured by many spiritual quests \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and many =\r\npeople&#39;s answers (be it satisfactory or unsatisfactory) \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; helped me=\r\n to advance. So I feel it might be the same with others. \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n I remember reading in Scott Peck&#39;s book -The Roads Less \nTravelled, &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; that to lose ones ego and to realize oneself, an ego must be \npresent &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; in the first place. I liked that statement very much because it \nis =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; from his book that I am first reading a statement in that line of =\r\n\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; thought. Everywhere people condemn ego and speak of losing ego as=\r\n the \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; way to realize God. But nobody has ever said that an ego is =\r\nnecessary \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to lose it. Nobody ever spoke of the `necessity&#39; and im=\r\nportance of \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ego to realize God. Scott Peck made it very clear tha=\r\nt if not having \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; an ego is a sign of realization, then all childre=\r\nn should be \nself-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; realized yogis, but in fact they are not. They b=\r\necome yogis when \nthey &lt;BR&gt;&gt; develop an ego and then lose it. May be thi=\r\ns is the way Divine \nMother &lt;BR&gt;&gt; wants it to happen. Someway, I liked w=\r\nhat Scott Peck said. \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; With Respects,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jyo=\r\nthi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In \n&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:sohamsa@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;soh=\r\namsa@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;Narasimha \nP.V.R.

Arent they also living organisms? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ..snip.. He \nsaid, =\r\nif what I am saying is correct, only human &lt;BR&gt;&gt; beings &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&=\r\ngt; will be evolved and other organisms will never attain moksha. I &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; \nwas &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; breathless for a moment and did not know how to a=\r\nnswer \nhim. I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; really &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; felt sad (and ashamed, bec=\r\nause I \nthought I could answer all &lt;BR&gt;&gt; questions &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; re=\r\nlated to the \nmystery of life) that I couldnt answer &lt;BR&gt;&gt; him. ..snip..=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Well, sadhana (effort) is what a being d=\r\noes. Phala (fruits) are \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; decided by the Lord. If God wants, a bact=\r\neria can get moksha too. \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; However, *usually* god has some rules of=\r\n action and reaction to \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; uphold and hence does not act out of orde=\r\nr. So the chance of a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nbaterium to get moksha is negligible (excep=\r\nt at the end of this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \ncreation cycle).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; It is indeed true that amoeba \nor bacteria have very very small &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; chance of moksha in THAT life. \nHowever, nobody stops them from doing &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; some good karma (possibly by \n*chance*), get a higher birth and &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; eventually be born as a human and do \nsome sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; When I wrote &quot;by chance&quot;, it may \nmake some uncomfortable. =\r\nBut that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; is the fact. Whatever action we \nperform with a sense of =\r\n*I-ness* &lt;BR&gt;&gt; behind that action becomes a karma \n(action) and an equal=\r\n and opposite &lt;BR&gt;&gt; phala (fruit/reaction) will come. \nSuppose one donat=\r\nes one&#39;s eyes and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; feels good about the noble act and \nthe person g=\r\netting the eyes uses &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the newly gotten vision to look at \nsome beau=\r\ntiful women, be tempted &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and rape them, the donor will get part \nof=\r\n that karma! The laws of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; karma are complex. Thinking like &quot;this is=\r\n a \nnoble karma. So it is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; good only&quot; is incorrect. Each action res=\r\nults in a \nseries of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; developments and begets some karma for the pe=\r\nrson. Of course, \nif an &lt;BR&gt;&gt; act is with committed with ego but not an =\r\nintention to affect a \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; particular development, the part of the kar=\r\nma begotten from that \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; development is smaller (than it would be if=\r\n that development was \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; intended). Thus, even bacteria and amoeba c=\r\nan beget karma from the \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; results of their actions. But it is very =\r\nsmall and accumulates &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nslowly. Highly taamasik beings such as tree=\r\ns, amoeba and bacteria &lt;BR&gt;&gt; take \na looooong time to make progress on t=\r\nhe ladder of kaarmik &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nevolution.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nI want to make three \ncomments:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (1) One ne=\r\ned not feel sorry for the \namoeba and bacteria because &lt;BR&gt;&gt; they are mo=\r\nstly a long way from moksha. Not \nall beings need to get &lt;BR&gt;&gt; moksha ri=\r\nght away. If that is needed, god did \nnot need to create this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; worl=\r\nd. If there is unmanifested Brahman and \nnothing else in this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; univ=\r\nerse, that will solve all problems. But the \nfact is that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; manifest=\r\ned Brahman with infinite objects at varying levels \nof karmic &lt;BR&gt;&gt; evol=\r\nution is not really a problem! That is exactly what is \nneeded for &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n the Lila to unfold.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (2) If \nyou want to f=\r\neel sorry, feel sorry not for amoeba and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; bacteria, but for \nthose =\r\nwho got the valuable human birth and yet act &lt;BR&gt;&gt; like amoeba and \nbact=\r\neria spiritually. Pity those who are stuck in the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; cycle of \nhappin=\r\ness and sadness, elation and depression, hopes and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; despairs etc, \n=\r\nwithout realizing that the play will end soon and what &lt;BR&gt;&gt; birth one w=\r\nill \nget next is uncertain!!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (3) Actually,=\r\n more than \nothers, feel sorry for yourself. Who are we &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to worry a=\r\nbout others? \nThey, their god and their gurus will feel &lt;BR&gt;&gt; sorry for =\r\nthem and do \nsomething about them. Apne ko kya lena dena? We &lt;BR&gt;&gt; are f=\r\nirst responsible \nfor ourselves. When one cannot change self and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; f=\r\nocus attention on god \nfully within oneself, what is the point in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nlamenting about the \nspirituality or lack of it in other people? So, &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; we should all try to \nlook inward and take a critical look at &lt;BR&gt;&gt; o=\r\nurselves, given that we got a \nvery very very valuable life as a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; h=\r\numan being.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; His question gave me a s=\r\nleepless night. I thought a lot about \nit. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nhe whole world as a maya exist only in \nhuman&#39;s mind (as per my &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; understanding, our mind creates this \nworld, when through yoga, &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; mind/ego collapse happens, there is \nno world or anything a=\r\nnd we &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; submerge as oneness in the \nomnipotent power), if =\r\nit is a creation &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; mind, then \nthere should no=\r\nt be any world when the human species &lt;BR&gt;&gt; is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; extin=\r\nct. Right? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; A mind is a mind is a \nmind. M=\r\nind creates the world, not necessarily &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a human mind. All minds \nca=\r\nn create a world. However, a human mind is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; more capable than other=\r\n \nminds to break down that created world and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; return to the source.=\r\n THAT \nis the point.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; (I am asking you=\r\n because, \nyou were instrumental (though &lt;BR&gt;&gt; unknowingly) &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; in \nopening the wide horizon of spiritual knowledge to me years &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; back \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; through just one reply to one of my questions=\r\n related to \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Kundalini. I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; am always indebted to=\r\n you for that and \nnow I realise how stupid &lt;BR&gt;&gt; my &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nquestions were at that \ntime.) &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I am glad =\r\nto know that. I am actually a \nfool who does not know much &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and can=\r\nnot help anyone. But the blessings \nof my gurus may work &lt;BR&gt;&gt; through m=\r\ne sometimes and benefit some.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; First:=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I would like to know if \nyou have heard of any vamachar=\r\nis in India &lt;BR&gt;&gt; who &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \nfollowed Vama Marga successful=\r\nly and realised God. All true &lt;BR&gt;&gt; saints I \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; have he=\r\nard are followers of the Satwik path/right hand \ntantra. So &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; always wonder, did any body succeed in the other \nway? Anybody who &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; well-known as a Vamamarga \nsaint?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&=\r\nnbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Your question is kind of an oxymoron. \nCan good aghoris=\r\n become &quot;well-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; known&quot; and come to limelight? :-)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&nbsp=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I know one masterly aghori reasonably well. However, he \nis=\r\n not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; restricted to one path. All paths are his own and he does not=\r\n \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; distinguish. He does aghora sadhanas in smashana and also Vedic =\r\n\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sadhanas like Vedic homas with the same attitude. He chants Vedic=\r\n \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; mantras too. For example, when he chants Sri Rudram, it produces=\r\n \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; amazing energy all around. He is a bhakti yogi too. When he thin=\r\nks of \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Krishna, he melts in devotion. When he discusses upanishads=\r\n and other \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Vedanta texts such as Yoga Vaasishtham and BhagavadGit=\r\na, his keen \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; intellect shines forth like a Sun and illuminates the=\r\n thinking of a \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ready audience. I have never seen anyone who has s=\r\nuch a perfect \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; understanding of the essence of Upanishads and exud=\r\nes it in thoughts, \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; words and actions. He has wife and children, h=\r\nas a full-time job and \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; engages in several external activities and=\r\n is never idle. But his \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; level of detachment with the work he does=\r\n so expertly is far higher \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; than even ascetics who renounce everyt=\r\nhing and *try* to develop some \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; detachment.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Bottomline is that he is \nan aghori, but he is also a jnaana yog=\r\ni, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; bhakti yogi, karma yogi and \nraaja yogi. He is a vaidika and he=\r\n is an &lt;BR&gt;&gt; aghori. All paths are his and \nhe views all the same way. I=\r\n don&#39;t know &lt;BR&gt;&gt; if all really good aghoris are \nlike that or just he.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In any case, it is \nirrelevant to you if a=\r\nny aghori succeeded or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; not. If YOU are meant to \nsucceed in aghota=\r\n, you will. If not, you &lt;BR&gt;&gt; will not. To be safe, until \nthe right tim=\r\ne and right person comes, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; one should not venture into \naghora. I w=\r\nant people to appreciate &lt;BR&gt;&gt; different things for what they are \nand n=\r\not have unhealthy biases, but &lt;BR&gt;&gt; it does not mean everybody should \nt=\r\nry everything. Nuclear engineers &lt;BR&gt;&gt; hating politicians, politicians \n=\r\nhating lawyers and lawyers hating &lt;BR&gt;&gt; doctors is bad. But one should b=\r\necome \nwhat one is supposed to!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; A few=\r\n years back, \nI had read AGHORA -Kundalini by Robert Svoboda. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \nthat book one Aghori Vimalananda is mentioned. But excep=\r\nt in that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; book, I couldnt find any references to this p=\r\nerson anywhere. Not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \neven &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; in net. (The only ref=\r\nerences were the ones related to \nRobert &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Swaboda&#39;s book =\r\nand as his Guru).&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Well, he g=\r\nuarded his privacy and made sure that the \nbooks came out &lt;BR&gt;&gt; only aft=\r\ner he left the body. Moreover, his real name was \nnot that. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Also, =\r\nhe led his spiritual life in relative seclusion and not \nmany &lt;BR&gt;&gt; knew=\r\n him. No wonder you can&#39;t find info on him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; Bottomline is: Whether he is real or not, one can benefit from \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n teachings attributed to him. The knowledge present in the aghora \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n series of books is nothing short of amazing. It may shock you, but it \n&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; can change your thinking from inside out and give you a clearer \n&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; understanding. Vimalananda not only managed to impart great &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n=\r\nunderstanding to Svoboda, but also ensure that Mother Taaraa Herself &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; \nwould speak through Svoboda and the knowledge would come out perfect. &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; \nOther books authored by Svoboda may not have the same brilliance, =\r\nbut &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nthose books came out just as Vimalananda intended.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; There are many things in the book which could not h=\r\nave come from a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nnormal person. They came from someone who had a p=\r\nerfect, steady and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nunwavering understanding of the absolute truth=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \nBTW, you cannot meet a good and genuine=\r\n aghori unless there is a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; rina \nand *he* wants you to meet him.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Best \nregards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; \n------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; \nDo a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrol=\r\noger.org/homam&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; Do P=\r\nitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&quot;=\r\n&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A =\r\n\nhref=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A \nhref=\r\n=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&quot;&gt;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&lt;=\r\n/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; Sri Ja=\r\ngannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.SriJagannath.org&quot;&gt;http=\r\n://www.SriJagannath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n---------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In=\r\n &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;mailto:sohamsa@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;sohamsa@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, \n=\r\n&quot;jyothi_b_lakshmi&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;jyothi_b_lakshmi@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimhji,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Enjoyed reading both your mails.

But except in that =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; book, I \ncouldnt find any references to this person anyw=\r\nhere. Not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; even &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; in net. (The only references we=\r\nre the ones related to Robert &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Swaboda&#39;s book and as his=\r\n Guru).&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Secondly, can yo=\r\nu please help me with a question?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; A week back, I was ela=\r\nborating about realisation and yoga, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nmeditation &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; and all such to one of my cousins who did not \nactually understand &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; all &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; what I said. He was asking \nme if yoga, be it jna=\r\nna yoga, bhakti &lt;BR&gt;&gt; yoga &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; or any \none, is the only w=\r\nay to attain moksha/realisation, then &lt;BR&gt;&gt; what &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; wil=\r\nl other living organisms like ameoba, bacteria and all will do \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; attain moksha? Arent they also living organisms? \n(He h=\r\nas done his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; research in Bio Informatics, hence his \nprio=\r\nrity to bacteria and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ameoba). He said, if what I am \nsay=\r\ning is correct, only human &lt;BR&gt;&gt; beings &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; will be evolv=\r\ned \nand other organisms will never attain moksha. I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; \nbreathless for a moment and did not know how to answer him. I &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; really \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; felt sad (and ashamed, because I thought I=\r\n could answer all \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; questions &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; related to the mys=\r\ntery of life) that I \ncouldnt answer him. His &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; question s=\r\neemed stupid, but when I \nthought of it, isnt that a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; valid &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; question?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; His question ga=\r\nve me a sleepless night. I thought a \nlot about it. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; the whole world as a maya exist \nonly in human&#39;s mind (as per my &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; understanding, our mind \ncreates this world, when through =\r\nyoga, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; mind/ego collapse \nhappens, there is no world or a=\r\nnything and we &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; submerge as \noneness in the omnipotent po=\r\nwer), if it is a creation &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; mind, then there =\r\nshould not be any world when the human species &lt;BR&gt;&gt; is \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; extinct. Right? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I dont \nknow if I=\r\n have convey my doubt clearly.&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Would you be able to share your knowledge on this? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; (I am asking you because, you were instrumental (though \n&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; unknowingly) &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; in opening the wide horizon of \nspir=\r\nitual knowledge to me years &lt;BR&gt;&gt; back &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; through just \n=\r\none reply to one of my questions related to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Kundalini. I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; am always indebted to you for that and now I realise how stupid =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; my \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; questions were at that time.) &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; With Respects,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Jyothi&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT=\r\n&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_00F1_01C903D3.4C04DE20--\r\n\n"}}
