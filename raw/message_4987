If one with a weak internal fire visualizes an internal homam, =\r\nit will not be that effective. Of course, it is safe to do and is better th=\r\nan sitting idle or watching TV or other such activities. But homam in an ex=\r\nternal fire is more effective for most people.\n&gt;  \n&gt; When we do homam, i.e.=\r\n when we invoke a deity in fire and make offerings while focusing the mind =\r\non sacred chants, essentially we are trying to strengthen, by resonance, th=\r\ne fire that burns inside one, which transforms all of one&#39;s &quot;experiences&quot; i=\r\nnto the underlying Truth. This is the fire that makes one experience deitie=\r\ns and finally the Absolute. Just as a young scholar benefits from spending =\r\ntime with a teacher or a mentor or a senior scholar, this internal fire ben=\r\nefits from spending time with a good-sized external fire in which deities a=\r\nre invited and visualized.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Apart from this =\r\nfundamental fire, there are so many specific fires in us. For example, jath=\r\naraagni (digestive fire) burns in the stomach and digests food. Whenever yo=\r\nu are eating, you are effectively performing a homam in this fire. Of cours=\r\ne, this fire is grosser than the above subtle fire that allows us to experi=\r\nence the Absolute. Nevertheless, it is fire too. Whenever you eat any food,=\r\n you can chant a mantra and imagine that you are making the offering to god=\r\n.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Please remember one thing. There are some=\r\n people on this yahoogroup, who are already quite pure with just a few shor=\r\ntcomings that are blocking them. They have made good progress in the last 3=\r\n-4 years. In the years to come, some more people will make a lot of progres=\r\ns. What is good enough for them may not be good enough for most people.\n&gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; 2. Normally, at times, when I offer akshatas=\r\n as flowers, I feel\n&gt; &gt; uncomfortable. With mental homam, I could imagine I=\r\n am actually\n&gt; &gt; using all the flowers in the world\n&gt; &gt; 3. Normally, naived=\r\nyam is more of routine. It is difficult to\n&gt; &gt; imagine the God eating it re=\r\nally. How ever, when\n&gt; &gt; it is done mentally, I could imagine the God actua=\r\nlly eating.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Why not? Even in an external homam, one can offer some si=\r\nmple food and imagine the god in fire to be actually eating that food! Exte=\r\nrnal ritual is not an obstruction for visualization. In fact, it provides a=\r\n platform for visualization. You can build whatever structures you want, on=\r\n top of that platform!\n&gt;  \n&gt; One can imagine that the deity is really sitti=\r\nng in fire. One can imagine that the deity is being given a garland with se=\r\nveral nice flowers. One can imagine that the deity is enjoying the incense.=\r\n One can imagine that the deity is enjoying nice foods. And so on.\n&gt;  \n&gt; * =\r\n       *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t worry about not completing homam. The objec=\r\ntive of the\n&gt; &gt; homam is to loose your self. If you lost your way in middle=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; and get immersed in meditation, it only indicates good.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Absolute=\r\nly. Of course, don&#39;t do it intentionally. That would be a pretension.\n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n If you start meditating in the middle of homam and lose track of homam and=\r\n fire goes away by the time you come back to your senses, do not worry abou=\r\nt it. But, if you are fully aware of your surroundings and homam, it is a g=\r\nood idea to ensure that the fire does not go away.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Na=\r\nrasimha\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish text=\r\nbook,\n&gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarp=\r\nana:\n&gt;                     http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;        Films th=\r\nat make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;        Spirituality: http=\r\n://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;     Jyotish writings: http://group=\r\ns.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ---------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- pvklnrao &lt;pvklnrao@...&gt; wrote: =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I had done homam mentally few times, and I would not=\r\n hesitate to do so in future.

I have =\r\nbrowsed several posts here and I do not know of any \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reference in=\r\n any traditional shastras, so I have a question regarding the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pe=\r\nrformance of homam in one&#39;s mind. There must be times in one&#39;s life when \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; several restrictions of time or place or any other reasons - do no=\r\nt allow one to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perform an external homam under the &quot;perfect&quot; con=\r\nditions that one would like. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. So how doe=\r\ns one go about this? Does one mentally visualize oneself performing \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; all the external rituals from A-Z? What if one&#39;s mind cannot &quot;multi-tas=\r\nk&quot; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; synchronize the mental recitation of mantras with the men=\r\ntal performance of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actions? What if one cannot maintain the same=\r\n standards of external environment \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purity, discipline etc? Is it=\r\n then best to avoid mental homam altogether?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Can on=\r\ne derive the same benefit from a mental homam that one would derive \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; from an external homam?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Could a regular perform=\r\nance of mental homam remove the impediments that is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blocking one=\r\n in doing homam in real life and may it result in one becoming \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; f=\r\nortunate enough to carry out real-life homam by the grace of God?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Many many Thanks\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
