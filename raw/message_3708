Do upto poorvaangam in the manual. Call Mahaganapathi in fire and idol and do pooja to them together. Make a few aahutis for Mahaganapathi in fire. You can also do the same thing with Navagrahas. Then do aavaahanaa in photo/idol and fire together. Do upacharas to them together. Then reach all prayers you normally read, while making offerings in fire. After your pooja is done, you can do uttaraangam from homam manual and poornaahuti. Meditate for a while and then do kshama praarthnaa and &quot;mnatraa heenam&quot; sloka.\n \nNyasas, raatri sooktam etc can be read in &quot;Durga saptashati&quot; published and sold for a very very small fee by &quot;Gita press&quot; - one really saattwik printing press in the religious world today. Aahutis with the moola mantra (om aim hreem kleem..) are offered just before and just after the 700 verses of saptashati. You can do aarati after naivedyam and before uttaraangam and poornaahuti.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shreyasampathy&quot; &lt;shreyasampathy@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Respected Guruji,\n&gt; \n&gt;               At first accept my regards to your Sri Charan!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; My the grace of God while searching internet I got your website.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have some doubts regarding Chandi Homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1)At the time of Navratri I keep 9 days puja with fasting ( without\n&gt; water till the evening puja and arati) and after the puja I take only\n&gt; the fruits prasad offered to Mata\n&gt; \n&gt; I am mentioning the procedure of my puja please rectify me where ever I\n&gt; am wrong\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.
