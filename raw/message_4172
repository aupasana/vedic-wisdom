I had my first darshan of Bhagavan in 1937\n=\r\nwhen I was just thirteen.\n\nTiruchuzhi Lakshmiammal was there at that time. =\r\nShe had been a playmate of\nBhagavan at Tiruchuzhi. She introduced me to Bha=\r\ngavan as her relative.\nBhagavan asked me, &quot;O, from Madurai? Which school ar=\r\ne you studying in?&quot; I\nanswered that I was studying in Sethupathi High Schoo=\r\nl. Bhagavan commented,\n&quot;Oh! That school is very old.&quot;\n\nLakshmiammal had fou=\r\nr sons and Lalita was the daughter of her second son,\nDr. Narayana Iyer. He=\r\nr first three sons, Ramakrishna Iyer, Narayana Iyer and\nMahadeva Iyer were =\r\nall Licensed Medical Practitioner doctors, certified from\nthe Tanjore Medic=\r\nal College. The fourth son, Guruswamy, was a teacher.\n\nWhen Lalita was born=\r\n in 1926 and brought to the presence of Bhagavan, he\nnamed her Lalita, tell=\r\ning her parents, &quot;You worship Sri Chakra and Sri\nVidya, so name her Lalita.=\r\n&quot;\n\nWhen we were young Lakshmiammal told my parents that her grand daughter\n=\r\nLalita and I were made for each other and that we should marry. In 1943 whe=\r\nn\nI was 19 and she 17 our marriage took place.\n\nMy wife Lalita was the one =\r\nwho had been with Bhagavan right from her\nchildhood. Bhagavan taught her co=\r\noking, grinding, mixing condiments, making\ngarlands, etc. He would even pla=\r\ny children&#39;s games with her. When they were\nyoung, my wife Lalita, Manavasi=\r\n Ramaswami&#39;s daughter, Lalita Venkataraman\nand others would play in the Ash=\r\nram. Bhagavan would sometimes call them, ask\nthem to come near, and narrate=\r\n stories to them.\n\nWe built a new house at Madurai and we went to Ramanasra=\r\nmam and invited\nBhagavan to come and grace our grihapravesam (house warming=\r\n ceremony).\nBhagavan laughed and pointing to the Hill said, &quot;You make this =\r\nAnnamalai to\ncome and then I too shall come.&quot;\n\nOnce when my wife and mother=\r\n-in-law were assisting Bhagavan in grinding rice\nand black gram for the nex=\r\nt day iddli preparation, utilizing a mortar,\nLalita said, &quot;Bhagavan you pus=\r\nh the flour and I shall grind,&quot; to which\nBhagavan replied, &quot; No Lalita, if =\r\nI push the flour I may forget myself and\ncrush my fingers. So you push the =\r\nflour and follow my grinding.&quot; Casual\nutterances like these by Bhagavan wer=\r\ne pregnant with meaning. This indicated\nhis state.\n\nWhen we were there, occ=\r\nasionally Chinnaswami would report to Bhagavan that\nthe storeroom was almos=\r\nt empty and that he was at a loss for what to do for\nthe morrow. Bhagavan w=\r\nould advise him not to worry. Then some devotees like\nus would bring rice, =\r\ndhal, provisions, leaf-plates, etc.\n\nOnce somebody who saw Bhagavan sitting=\r\n on the sofa in the old hall\ncommented, &quot;For a sadhu what need is there of =\r\na sofa?&quot; Hearing this Bhagavan\nsmiled and told Lalita, &quot;Look Lalita, am I s=\r\nitting for my sake on the sofa?\nIt is for others that I am here. For me, ac=\r\ntually, I do not require anything\nat all.&quot;\n\n\nBhagavan used to talk to me fr=\r\neely when we were alone. When I was with him\nevery morning at 4 `o clock he=\r\n would sometimes tell about his days in the\nArunachala Temple, life on the =\r\nHill, etc. His boyhood classmate and\nplaymate, Vilachery Ranga Iyer, would =\r\nalso tell me about his association\nwith Bhagavan. He once told me that one =\r\nday at Madurai while swimming in a\ntank he got trapped in the outlet. Bhaga=\r\nvan immediately went and rescued\nhim. Later on, he would say, &quot;Bhagavan you=\r\n rescued me once from the tank now\nyou should rescue me from samsara.&quot; It w=\r\nas usual for boys in those days to\nplait their long hair. Once when Venkato=\r\no (son of Chinnaswami) was a child\nstaying at Skandashram he refused to all=\r\now anyone to plait his hair. Then a\nsnake slowly slithered into the Ashram.=\r\n Bhagavan just told it to go away and\nit obeyed. Turning to the boy, Bhagav=\r\nan said, &quot;Even the snake obeys. Why\ndon&#39;t you too obey.&quot;\n\nBhagavan used to =\r\nsit on a raised platform at the entrance to Skandashram\nevery morning. Arou=\r\nnd that time of the day visitors from out of town would\nusually arrive by r=\r\nail. Whenever he saw any devotee or devotees climbing up\ntowards the Ashram=\r\n he would tell others to prepare extra food for the\nnewcomers.\n\nOne of my w=\r\nife&#39;s uncles set up a medical practice near Courtalam and donated\na piece o=\r\nf land to one of the devotees of Bhagavan, named Sivaiya. Sivaiya\nestablish=\r\ned an Ashram there and came to be known as Mouna Swami of\nCourtalam. Later =\r\nhearing that there were herbs on the Arunachala Hill that\nwould turn base m=\r\netal into gold he came to Bhagavan and asked about the\nherbs. Bhagavan told=\r\n him, &quot;You are a sannyasi. Why do you want to be an\nalchemist? Don&#39;t be int=\r\nerested in all these siddhis. They will lead you\nastray,&quot; and sent him away=\r\n.\n\nBhagavan would tell me about the greatness of the Hill =E2=80=94 how it =\r\nis a hill of\neffulgence. Just because trees grow on it we should not take i=\r\nt to be an\nordinary hill. He would extol the merits of going round the Hill=\r\n.\n\nIn 1946 when we visited the Ashram, we were standing near the newly buil=\r\nt\nhospital and Bhagavan was returning from the hill after his evening strol=\r\nl.\nWhen he came near he told my wife Lalita, &quot;You are a doctor&#39;s daughter. =\r\nYour\nfather and your uncles, Dr. Narayana Iyer, Dr. Mahadeva Iyer, Dr.\nRama=\r\nkrishna Iyer are all doctors. So go and help in arranging medicines in\ndisp=\r\nensary.&quot; Accordingly, my wife and I stayed there for three days and\narrange=\r\nd the medicines.\n\nOnce when we were taking leave of Bhagavan, he told us to=\r\n stay for two more\ndays. We obeyed him and on the next day there was a heav=\r\ny downpour and part\nof the railway track from Villupuram to Trichy was inun=\r\ndated. The trains\nwere cancelled. Now we understood why Bhagavan wanted us =\r\nto stay for two\nmore days.\n\nOnce when my wife informed Bhagavan that she wa=\r\ns going to Tiruchuzhi, he\ntold her to visit his house, the temple, the prim=\r\nary school where he\nstudied, the tank where he swam and other places where =\r\nhe used to play, etc.\n\nPeople who come to Bhagavan think that he is just li=\r\nke any other sage and\ncasually bow to him and go away, but he is Dakshinamu=\r\nrti himself. Whether at\nVirupaksha Cave, at Skandashram, in the Old Hall, o=\r\nutside the hall, in the\nJubilee Hall or in the New Hall he always used to s=\r\nit facing south like\nDakshinamurti. Even while lying down in the Nirvana Ro=\r\nom the door was facing\nsouth and he gave us his darshan facing south.\n\nWhen=\r\n Bhagavan had the tumour on his arm my wife saw the wound and started\nsobbi=\r\nng uncontrollably. Bhagavan looked at her and said, &quot;After coming to me\nfor=\r\n so long she still doesn&#39;t know that it is the body that suffers and not\nI.=\r\n Am I the body?&quot;\n\nSource: http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/2007/?pg=3D=\r\nmay-jun#article.6\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=\r\n=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=\r\n=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd116f029236b04844162bd\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nI was born at Madurai in 1924.
