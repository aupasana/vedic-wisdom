This is an unbel=\r\nievable experience that I have had. I have not added anything from my own. =\r\nI am writing exactly as was happened in my life. I am going back to the per=\r\niod of 1973/74. Kindly read this only when you are in religious mood. \n=C2=\r\n=A0 \nI was working as telegraphist at Okha Port Post office near Dwarka. My=\r\n duty was from 7 am to 7 pm and I was getting late fee allowance for extra =\r\nduty. There was a Telephone exchange just opposite to Post office and due t=\r\no same Dep=E2=80=99t; I had friendship with some Telephone operators. One M=\r\nr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel) was working as Operator=\r\n. He was a staunch devotee of=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 shri Ramkrishnadev. Wheneve=\r\nr I was meeting him he was always talking about shri Thakur. We came close =\r\nday by day. There was a weekly gathering at his home called SATSANGA. He wa=\r\ns singing devotional songs created by him and was weeping while singing. He=\r\n was reading Ramkrishna Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending t=\r\nhis weekly meeting on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Patel =\r\nwas of 30 then. We were used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after duty hou=\r\nrs and were talking only about Thakur. \nOne day when we were at sea shore h=\r\ne suddenly told me--=E2=80=9CRawalbhai, some guest have come to my home and=\r\n my wife is remembering me. My son will come in a few minutes to call me. I=\r\n shall have to go now=E2=80=9D. -- And with my surprise his 8 years old son=\r\n came to call him. \nAt one another incident he told me that there will be a=\r\n plane crash tomorrow and that also happened. I was very much impressed abo=\r\nut him. He could foresee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus, =\r\nhe told me not to go through bus, as bus tire will be punctured. Yet I went=\r\n to Bus station but bus did not come from Dwarka as was punctured on the wa=\r\ny. This was surprising. \nThis all incidents made me to believe that he had =\r\nsome super power and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was attr=\r\nacted to shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also be disciple of shri =\r\nThakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered myself to T=\r\nhakur at Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s house before Thakur picture. I prayed him deep=\r\nly from my heart to accept me as his follower and bestow his grace. \nNext d=\r\nay morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 morning while taking the=\r\n tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was waking up at 5.45 morning. I =\r\ntold to my wife in the morning that I have accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as m=\r\ny Gurudev. My wife was annoyed and she argued with me a lot. =E2=80=94=E2=\r\n=80=9CWhy should you take such a hasty decision? Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was =\r\na devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta. He was a great Saint but our Guru should=\r\n be living one, who can guide us, give us Mantra etc. etc. Better you take =\r\nDixa from Shri Ram Sharma Acharya since you are doing Gayatri Mantra=E2=80=\r\n=9D--. \nHer arguments were right at her place as people in general not know=\r\n much about Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I have taken hasty d=\r\necision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. -- \nBut I remember that Mr. P=\r\natel had told me that Thakur was telling their disciples to test him before=\r\n accepting him. I also decided to test Thakur. I immediately told my wife t=\r\nhat =E2=80=93=E2=80=9CSee, Mr. Patel has never come to our home. You have a=\r\nlso not seen him. He has never asked me where I am living. Suppose Mr. Pate=\r\nl is coming to our house within 10 to 15 minutes, would you believe that my=\r\n selection for Thakur is perfect?=E2=80=9D-- \nShe laughed at me=E2=80=94=E2=\r\n=80=9CHow it is possible? I don=E2=80=99t believe.=E2=80=9D-- \nI prayed Shr=\r\ni Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediately to justify my decision and convince =\r\nmy wife. =E2=80=98I want to test your existence even today.=E2=80=99 \nTo ou=\r\nr great surprise, Mr. Patel was at my home at 06.30 in the morning with ang=\r\nry mood. What he told? \n=E2=80=98 How dare you test Thakur this way? Do you=\r\n know what happened? Yesterday was my night duty and I had just come to my =\r\nhome at 05.30 mornings today and tried to sleep for 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly =\r\nThakur pulled my blanket and told me that-=E2=80=9C Go to your friend=E2=80=\r\n=99s house. He is waiting for you. He wants to test me. I will show you his=\r\n house=E2=80=9D \nI immediately rushed to your home. Thakur was guiding me t=\r\nhe way to your house and pushing me too. What you want? Why you are disturb=\r\ning him in such an early morning for such a silly things?=E2=80=99 \nWe both=\r\n were so excited and surprised that we had no words that Morning. \nI will n=\r\never forget that 5th April, a miracle day in my life. There were some more =\r\nDevine experiences about Shri Thakur but I will write it sometime. \nDear Si=\r\nr, and forum members, Ramkrishandev is still alive on the earth. This is a =\r\nfact I have written and no word is added to exaggerate.=C2=A0 May Shri Thak=\r\nur bless all of us. \nDr. Ashwin Rawal Ahmedabad\n\n \n\n_______________________=\r\n_________\nAdd more friends to your messenger and enjoy!
