But=\r\n the roles are not static. They are dynamic and may undergo fine-tuning or =\r\nmodification or evolution from time to time (and life to life) based on how=\r\n we play our allotted roles. \n\nThe role you are given is your destiny and h=\r\now you play it is your free will. How you play your role now (free will) in=\r\nfluences what role you are given in future (destiny).\n\nIf the role given to=\r\n you (e.g. Arjuna) is to kill your guru (Drona) and relatives, you cannot e=\r\nscape it. But you can either do it with a hateful mind or a guilty mind or =\r\nyou can do it with a calm mind. If the role given to you (e.g. Janaka) is t=\r\no rule a big kingdom, you cannot escape and do penances in a forest. But yo=\r\nu can either rule the kingdom with a proud and attached mind or with a calm=\r\n mind. If the role given to you (e.g. Swami Samarth Ramadas) is to guide a =\r\nmighty king (Shivaji) in resisting the invading muslim\n kings, you cannot e=\r\nscape it. But you can either do it with an attached and agitated mind or a =\r\ncalm mind.\n\nPeople in the examples I mentioned above engaged in what may se=\r\nem like material actions, but they did them after overcoming attachments an=\r\nd with an equanimous mind.\n\nAs I keep saying, what you do is a secondary fa=\r\nctor and how you do it is primary. Even as we engage in actions that we bel=\r\nieve to be our dharma, we should work on our attitude and increase surrende=\r\nr. When one has surrendered to god and is able to look at pleasure and pain=\r\n, praise and censure in the same way, then one&#39;s dharma will be far clearer=\r\n to one. One whose mind is densely conditioned by duality and desires will =\r\nsee one&#39;s dharma through the coloring of that conditioning and may misjudge=\r\n. On the other hand, one with a clear mind with very little conditioning wi=\r\nll see one&#39;s dharma clearer.\n\nIn simpler words, one who heavily identifies =\r\nwith the body and wants\n comforts and pleasures of the body will see one&#39;s =\r\ndharma from that motivation. One may identify with body, with a group of pe=\r\nople, with a deity etc. As is the identification, so is the conditioning an=\r\nd so is one&#39;s vision of one&#39;s dharma.\n\nThough everyone is playing their all=\r\notted role, some have densely conditioned minds and unable to see their dha=\r\nrma clearly and pursuing adharma. As a result, they may continue to be allo=\r\ntted roles where densely conditioned minds restrict their actions, in futur=\r\ne.\n\nSome have very clear minds and able to see their dharma clearly and pur=\r\nsuing higher dharma. As a result, they may continue to allotted roles where=\r\n lighter and lighter mental conditioning restricts them and eventually they=\r\n become free.\n\nOne can try to use free will to move from the former case to=\r\n the latter case.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- ---------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n=C2=A0 Free Jyotish\n Software, F=\r\nree Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for =\r\nshort Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =\r\n=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n=C2=A0 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\n=C2=A0 =C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n=C2=\r\n=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n----=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n\n---=\r\n- Raj Nambisan &lt;rajnambisan@ yahoo.com&gt;\n wrote: \n&gt; namaste,\n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; i ha=\r\nve a question: if everyone is playing the allotted role, as the peerless ma=\r\nharshi alludes to, then what&#39;s the point in our debating these things? \n&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0 \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t the thesis apply to osama, nehru, gandhiji equally -- th=\r\nat is, each one is/was playing the exact role he is/was supposed to, right =\r\nor wrong?\n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; which begs the question, when does free will begin and=\r\n fate end?\n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; enlightenment, please..\n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; regards,\n&gt;=C2=A0 \n=\r\n&gt; raj\n\n---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@yahoo. co.in&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear KK,\n&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0 \n&gt; Great question!\n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; Also, I personally do not agree that a=\r\n saint cannot interfere in the political situation of a country.

One may identify with body, with a group of people, with a dei=\r\nty etc. As is the identification, so is the conditioning and so is one&#39;s vi=\r\nsion of one&#39;s dharma.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though everyone is playing their allotted role=\r\n, some have densely conditioned minds and unable to see their dharma clearl=\r\ny and pursuing adharma. As a result, they may continue to be allotted roles=\r\n where densely conditioned minds restrict their actions, in future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\nSome have very clear minds and able to see their dharma clearly and pursuin=\r\ng higher dharma. As a result, they may continue to allotted roles where lig=\r\nhter and lighter mental conditioning restricts them and eventually they bec=\r\nome free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One can try to use free will to move from the former case =\r\nto the latter case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;------------ -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; Free\n Jy=\r\notish\n Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself=\r\n&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;=\r\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_b=\r\nlank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.=\r\norg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Films that make a difference: &lt;a rel=3D=\r\n&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot;&gt;http://Sar=\r\naswatiFil ms.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirituality: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;no=\r\nfollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdo=\r\nm&quot;&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; Jyotish writ=\r\nings: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/JyotishWritings&quot;&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings&lt;/a=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- -&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;---- Raj Nambisan &lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;\n hr=\r\nef=3D&quot;http://us.mc300.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Drajnambisan@...&quot;=\r\n&gt;rajnambisan@ yahoo.com&lt;/a&gt;&gt;\n wrote: &lt;br&gt;&gt; namaste,&lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; i have a question: if everyone is playing the allotted role, as the p=\r\neerless maharshi alludes to, then what&#39;s the point in our debating these th=\r\nings? &lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; wouldn&#39;t the thesis apply to osama, nehru, ga=\r\nndhiji equally -- that is, each one is/was playing the exact role he is/was=\r\n supposed to, right or wrong?&lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; which begs the questio=\r\nn, when does free will begin and fate end?&lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; enlighten=\r\nment, please..&lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; regards,&lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; raj&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;---- rajarshi nandy &lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D=\r\n&quot;http://us.mc300.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Drajarshi14@...&quot;&gt;raj=\r\narshi14@yahoo. co.in&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;br&gt;&gt; Dear KK,&lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; Great question!&lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Also, I personally do not agree th=\r\nat a saint cannot interfere in the political situation of a country.
