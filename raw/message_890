When one&#39;s mind repeats the same c=\r\nombination of \n    sounds over and over again, eventually one&#39;s mind may lo=\r\nse all other \n    thoughts and become absorbed in that combination of sound=\r\ns. THEN one&#39;s mind \n    experiences the energy represented by that combinat=\r\nion of sounds.\n\n    Different combinations of sounds have different energie=\r\ns. But experiencing \n    the energy of any combination of sounds is a bette=\r\nr experience for the mind \n    than the regular chaotic experiences mind ha=\r\ns in a cacaphony of thoughts.\n\n    The energy represented by properly chant=\r\ned Veda mantras is in a different \n    league. However, it is almost imposs=\r\nible to chant Veda mantras perfectly in \n    today&#39;s times. The knowledge i=\r\ns lost. The way people chant them, veda \n    mantras get corrupted and they=\r\n end up working like other mantras and do not \n    really act as veda mantr=\r\nas. Even if one experiences a veda mantra, one \n    experiences the energy =\r\nof a corrupted version and not of the original veda \n    mantra.\n\n    The e=\r\nxpression &quot;Om bhur bhuvah suvah/svah&quot; is not part of the actual savitru \n  =\r\n  gayatri mantra. The actual veda mantra starts with &quot;tat savitur&quot; and ends=\r\n \n    with &quot;prachodayaat&quot;.\n\n    I never recorded an audio clip of my Gayatr=\r\ni chanting. I only hummed the ups \n    and downs to show the intonation. I =\r\nwas instructed to never chant Savitru \n    Gayatri mantra loud. Spiritually=\r\n speaking, that mantra is my food and I get \n    whatever little energy I h=\r\nave from it. In order to continue doing my dharma \n    in the world, I will=\r\n need to be selfish with my food. I can share everything \n    else with the=\r\n world.\n\n    Astrology knowledge that we have on earth today is insufficien=\r\nt to give \n    perfect guidance. A good guru may be able to do a better job=\r\n than astrology \n    as we understand it.\n\n    I have seen my guru make som=\r\ne interesting mantra suggestions. For example, I \n    once mentioned to Man=\r\nish a friend who visits me often and meditates when I \n    do homam. Manish=\r\n said, &quot;he will not be interested in doing homam by himself. \n    If at all=\r\n he does, it will not be Mahaganapathi homam or Chandi homam. Teach \n    hi=\r\nm Vishnu sahasra naama homam. He MAY be interested in that. He will like \n =\r\n   Vishnu sahasra naama stotram.&quot; I had not mentioned much about that perso=\r\nn to \n    Manish and only said the name. Interestingly, Vishnu sahasra naam=\r\na stotra is \n    indeed a favorite prayer of that person. Another time, I m=\r\net a person who \n    loves Ganapathi atharva seersham and chants it everyda=\r\ny and interested in \n    doing Mahaganapathi homam. Manish told me, &quot;if he =\r\nwants, he can do \n    Mahaganapathi homam. But eventually there is another =\r\nsadhana he needs to do. \n    He needs to chant Hanuman Chalisa everyday 108=\r\n or 54 times for one whole \n    year. It will transform his life.&quot; I had no=\r\nt mentioned anything about that \n    person to Manish. Interestingly, when =\r\nthis person was young, he was a sishya \n    of a great spiritual master in =\r\nthe lineage of Sadguru Samartha Ramadas \n    (considered to be born with Lo=\r\nrd Hanuman&#39;s amsa). He said to me later that \n    his guru had also advised=\r\n him in the past to just stick to Hanuman chalisa! \n    Interestingly, the =\r\nsame suggestion came to Manish&#39;s mind.\n\n    Of course, Manish tells me at o=\r\nther times that he knows nothing and says \n    whatever comes to his mind. =\r\nIf he ends up giving correct guidance to \n    someone, he says it is becaus=\r\ne the Mother wanted someone to get correct \n    guidance and he is just a n=\r\nimitta.\n\n    I believe that a sadguru with very limited individual ego and =\r\nin tune with \n    Nature will be able to give far better guidance in spirit=\r\nual sadhana than \n    astrology as we know it today.\n\n    For Mars and Rahu=\r\n in 8th, I can suggest Lord Subrahmanya.\n\n    Best regards,\n    Narasimha\n =\r\n   ----------------------------------------------------------\n    Do a Shor=\r\nt Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n    Do Pitri Tarpana=\r\ns Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n    Spirituality: http:/=\r\n/groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http:/=\r\n/vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n    Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAstrologer.org\n    Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.Sr=\r\niJagannath.org\n    --------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-- \n\n    ----- Original Message ----- \n    From: &quot;vinita kumar&quot; &lt;vinitakuma=\r\n@...&gt;\n    To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n    Sent: Sunday, Januar=\r\ny 04, 2009 3:45 AM\n    Subject: [vedic-wisdom] gayatri mantra\n\n    &gt; dear n=\r\narasimha ji and friends,\n    &gt; namaste!\n    &gt;\n    &gt; i understand that the s=\r\nyllables / metre of the mantra is very\n    &gt; important. that is why (probab=\r\nly) mantra was passed on from the guru\n    &gt; to ths sishya by word of mouth=\r\n. somebody even said that in the end\n    &gt; it is the metre only that remain=\r\ns in the mantra...and not even the\n    &gt; words. something like the smile of=\r\n the cheshire cat remaining even\n    &gt; when the cat itself vanishes in alic=\r\ne in the wonderland.\n    &gt;\n    &gt; i too have been looking at / bringing to m=\r\ny consciousness the\n    &gt; gayatri mantra of late. for lack of guidance, i h=\r\nave been relying on\n    &gt; the internet. the first thing that kind of took m=\r\ny breath away was\n    &gt; the layers and layers of meaning attached to each w=\r\nord of the\n    &gt; mantra. that is probably because all sanskrit words are li=\r\nke\n    &gt; that....you peel one layer and another layer lies below..and then\n=\r\n    &gt; still another and another....\n    &gt;\n    &gt; but more importantly (perha=\r\nps) is the different ways this mantra\n    &gt; gets recited. i tried to count =\r\nthe syllables to see whether they\n    &gt; added upto 24. they almost did, to =\r\nmy recknoning, but i wasn&#39;t sure\n    &gt; whether om in the beginning is part =\r\nof the mantra or not. it probaly\n    &gt; is, but i want to be sure.\n    &gt;\n   =\r\n &gt; secondly, depending on who chants the mantra, the words\n    &gt; are &quot;spelt=\r\n&quot; / &quot;pronounced&quot; differently. For instance in one\n    &gt; rendering i found &quot;=\r\nswah&quot; being pronounced as &quot;suvah&quot; which becomes\n    &gt; two syllables instead=\r\n of one. simarly, in the same\n    &gt; rendering &quot;prachodyat&quot; is stretched to =\r\n3 syllables instead of 2.\n    &gt;\n    &gt; so i am confused as to the &quot;right&quot; re=\r\nndition.\n    &gt;\n    &gt; i recall, quite some time back, narsimha ji had posted=\r\n his rendition\n    &gt; of the gayatri mantra in an audio clip. i have not bee=\r\nn able to find\n    &gt; it again. but i wish he or someone could guide me abou=\r\nt this.\n    &gt;\n    &gt; i would also like to know the importance of the number =\r\nof syllables\n    &gt; in each mantra and how this is suitable for different pe=\r\nrsons\n    &gt; depending on their &quot;karmic structures&quot; which are sometimes / al=\r\nways\n    &gt; (?) reflected in the astrological chart. maybe a guru by just\n  =\r\n  &gt; looking at a person can know intuitively what is the &quot;right&quot; mantra\n   =\r\n &gt; for the person. maybe a good astrologer can also do the same.\n    &gt;\n    =\r\n&gt; i know this is not an astrology forum, but still i am seeking\n    &gt; guida=\r\nnce on &quot;appeasement&quot; of mars and rahu in 8th house and retro\n    &gt; saturn i=\r\nn 6th house for taurus lagna...throough mantra.

THEN one&#39;s mind &lt;BR&gt;experiences the energy represented by that \n=\r\n    combination of sounds.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Different combinations of sounds have \n  =\r\n  different energies. But experiencing &lt;BR&gt;the energy of any combination of=\r\n \n    sounds is a better experience for the mind &lt;BR&gt;than the regular chaot=\r\nic \n    experiences mind has in a cacaphony of thoughts.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The energy =\r\n\n    represented by properly chanted Veda mantras is in a different &lt;BR&gt;lea=\r\ngue. \n    However, it is almost impossible to chant Veda mantras perfectly =\r\nin \n    &lt;BR&gt;today&#39;s times. The knowledge is lost. The way people chant them=\r\n, veda \n    &lt;BR&gt;mantras get corrupted and they end up working like other ma=\r\nntras and do \n    not &lt;BR&gt;really act as veda mantras. Even if one experienc=\r\nes a veda mantra, \n    one &lt;BR&gt;experiences the energy of a corrupted versio=\r\nn and not of the \n    original veda &lt;BR&gt;mantra.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The expression &quot;Om b=\r\nhur bhuvah suvah/svah&quot; \n    is not part of the actual savitru &lt;BR&gt;gayatri m=\r\nantra. The actual veda mantra \n    starts with &quot;tat savitur&quot; and ends &lt;BR&gt;w=\r\nith &quot;prachodayaat&quot;&lt;WBR&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I \n    never recorded an audio clip of my G=\r\nayatri chanting. I only hummed the ups \n    &lt;BR&gt;and downs to show the inton=\r\nation. I was instructed to never chant \n    Savitru &lt;BR&gt;Gayatri mantra loud=\r\n. Spiritually speaking, that mantra is my \n    food and I get &lt;BR&gt;whatever =\r\nlittle energy I have from it. In order to \n    continue doing my dharma &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;in the world, I will need to be selfish with my \n    food. I can share eve=\r\nrything &lt;BR&gt;else with the world.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Astrology \n    knowledge that we ha=\r\nve on earth today is insufficient to give &lt;BR&gt;perfect \n    guidance. A good=\r\n guru may be able to do a better job than astrology &lt;BR&gt;as \n    we understa=\r\nnd it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I have seen my guru make some interesting mantra \n    suggest=\r\nions. For example, I &lt;BR&gt;once mentioned to Manish a friend who visits \n    =\r\nme often and meditates when I &lt;BR&gt;do homam. Manish said, &quot;he will not be \n =\r\n   interested in doing homam by himself. &lt;BR&gt;If at all he does, it will not=\r\n be \n    Mahaganapathi homam or Chandi homam. Teach &lt;BR&gt;him Vishnu sahasra =\r\nnaama \n    homam. He MAY be interested in that. He will like &lt;BR&gt;Vishnu sah=\r\nasra naama \n    stotram.&quot; I had not mentioned much about that person to &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Manish and only \n    said the name. Interestingly, Vishnu sahasra naama st=\r\notra is &lt;BR&gt;indeed a \n    favorite prayer of that person. Another time, I m=\r\net a person who &lt;BR&gt;loves \n    Ganapathi atharva seersham and chants it eve=\r\nryday and interested in \n    &lt;BR&gt;doing Mahaganapathi homam. Manish told me,=\r\n &quot;if he wants, he can do \n    &lt;BR&gt;Mahaganapathi homam. But eventually there=\r\n is another sadhana he needs to \n    do. &lt;BR&gt;He needs to chant Hanuman Chal=\r\nisa everyday 108 or 54 times for one \n    whole &lt;BR&gt;year. It will transform=\r\n his life.&quot; I had not mentioned anything \n    about that &lt;BR&gt;person to Mani=\r\nsh. Interestingly, when this person was young, \n    he was a sishya &lt;BR&gt;of =\r\na great spiritual master in the lineage of Sadguru \n    Samartha Ramadas &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;(considered to be born with Lord Hanuman&#39;s amsa). He \n    said to me late=\r\nr that &lt;BR&gt;his guru had also advised him in the past to just \n    stick to =\r\nHanuman chalisa! &lt;BR&gt;Interestingly, the same suggestion came to \n    Manish=\r\n&#39;s mind.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Of course, Manish tells me at other times that he \n    know=\r\ns nothing and says &lt;BR&gt;whatever comes to his mind. If he ends up giving \n  =\r\n  correct guidance to &lt;BR&gt;someone, he says it is because the Mother wanted =\r\n\n    someone to get correct &lt;BR&gt;guidance and he is just a nimitta.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I=\r\n \n    believe that a sadguru with very limited individual ego and in tune w=\r\nith \n    &lt;BR&gt;Nature will be able to give far better guidance in spiritual s=\r\nadhana \n    than &lt;BR&gt;astrology as we know it today.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For Mars and Rah=\r\nu in 8th, I \n    can suggest Lord Subrahmanya.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best \n    regards,&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;--=\r\n-------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;-&lt;BR&gt;Do \n    a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A \n    href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;WBR&gt;rologer.o=\r\nrg/&lt;WBR&gt;homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do \n    Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A \n    href=3D&quot;http:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;WBR&gt;rologer.org/&lt;WBR=\r\n&gt;tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: \n    &lt;A \n    href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.&lt;WBR&gt;yahoo.com/&lt;WBR&gt;group/vedic-&lt;WBR&gt;wisd=\r\nom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free \n    Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A \n    href=3D&quot;http://vedicastr=\r\no.home.comcast.net&quot;&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;WBR&gt;home.comcast.&lt;WBR&gt;net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Fre=\r\ne \n    Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A \n    href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrolog=\r\ner.org&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;WBR&gt;rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri \n    Jagannath Centr=\r\ne (SJC) website: &lt;A \n    href=3D&quot;http://www.SriJagannath.org&quot;&gt;http://www.Sr=\r\niJagan&lt;WBR&gt;nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---=\r\n------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;- \n    &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----- Original Messag=\r\ne ----- &lt;BR&gt;From: &quot;vinita kumar&quot; &lt;&lt;A \n    href=3D&quot;mailto:vinitakuma%40gm=\r\nail.com&quot;&gt;vinitakuma@gmail.&lt;WBR&gt;com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To: \n    &lt;&lt;A \n    href=3D&quot;=\r\nmailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@&lt;WBR&gt;yahoogroups.&lt;WBR&gt;c=\r\nom&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sent: \n    Sunday, January 04, 2009 3:45 AM&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedi=\r\nc-wisdom] gayatri \n    mantra&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; dear narasimha ji and friends,&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; \n    namaste!&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; i understand that the syllables / metre=\r\n of the \n    mantra is very&lt;BR&gt;&gt; important. that is why (probably) mantr=\r\na was passed \n    on from the guru&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to ths sishya by word of mouth. =\r\nsomebody even said \n    that in the end&lt;BR&gt;&gt; it is the metre only that r=\r\nemains in the \n    mantra...and not even the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; words. something like =\r\nthe smile of the \n    cheshire cat remaining even&lt;BR&gt;&gt; when the cat itse=\r\nlf vanishes in alice in \n    the wonderland.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; i too have bee=\r\nn looking at / bringing to my \n    consciousness the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; gayatri mantra=\r\n of late. for lack of guidance, i \n    have been relying on&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the int=\r\nernet. the first thing that kind of took \n    my breath away was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; th=\r\ne layers and layers of meaning attached to each \n    word of the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ma=\r\nntra. that is probably because all sanskrit words are \n    like&lt;BR&gt;&gt; tha=\r\nt....you peel one layer and another layer lies below..and \n    then&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n still another and another....&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; but more \n    importantly (p=\r\nerhaps) is the different ways this mantra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; gets \n    recited. i trie=\r\nd to count the syllables to see whether they&lt;BR&gt;&gt; added \n    upto 24. th=\r\ney almost did, to my recknoning, but i wasn&#39;t sure&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n    whether om =\r\nin the beginning is part of the mantra or not. it probaly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n    is, =\r\nbut i want to be sure.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; secondly, depending on who chants \n =\r\n   the mantra, the words&lt;BR&gt;&gt; are &quot;spelt&quot; / &quot;pronounced&quot; differently. Fo=\r\nr \n    instance in one&lt;BR&gt;&gt; rendering i found &quot;swah&quot; being pronounced as=\r\n &quot;suvah&quot; \n    which becomes&lt;BR&gt;&gt; two syllables instead of one. simarly, =\r\nin the \n    same&lt;BR&gt;&gt; rendering &quot;prachodyat&quot; is stretched to 3 syllables=\r\n instead of \n    2.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; so i am confused as to the &quot;right&quot; \n   =\r\n rendition.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; i recall, quite some time back, narsimha ji had=\r\n \n    posted his rendition&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of the gayatri mantra in an audio clip. =\r\ni have \n    not been able to find&lt;BR&gt;&gt; it again. but i wish he or someon=\r\ne could guide \n    me about this.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; i would also like to know=\r\n the importance of \n    the number of syllables&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in each mantra and =\r\nhow this is suitable for \n    different persons&lt;BR&gt;&gt; depending on their =\r\n&quot;karmic structures&quot; which are \n    sometimes / always&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (?) reflected=\r\n in the astrological chart. maybe a \n    guru by just&lt;BR&gt;&gt; looking at a =\r\nperson can know intuitively what is the \n    &quot;right&quot; mantra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; for the=\r\n person. maybe a good astrologer can also do \n    the same.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n i know this is not an astrology forum, but still i \n    am seeking&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n guidance on &quot;appeasement&quot; of mars and rahu in 8th house \n    and retro&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; saturn in 6th house for taurus lagna...throough mantra. \n    These&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; planets aspect all the other planets (jupiter, sun and mercury \n    in=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2nd house and venus moon in third house).&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n    tha=\r\nnkyou!&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; love and best wishes,&#39;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  vinita&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/=\r\nBLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0198_01C970F3.0EFD3990--\r\n\n"}}
