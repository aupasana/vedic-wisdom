I had=\r\n trouble falling asleep, because I could hear strange noises -  creaking an=\r\nd something moving in the attic. I&#39;m very sensitive to different energies -=\r\n I don&#39;t see anything, but I feel whether something divine or rather evil i=\r\ns present in a certain place. That place didn&#39;t feel good to me.\n\nI was sta=\r\nying there for 10 days and every night I would make up because of a feeling=\r\n of somebody staring at me - I could see them but once I started focusing o=\r\nn them, they vanished. Sometimes I would wake up in a terrified state breat=\r\nhing rapidly. One day I could definitely hear some steps near the bed and a=\r\n roar. I reached for my flashlight to see nothing.\n\nThis doesn&#39;t seem like =\r\nsleep paralysis to me - I instantly become fully aware and I can move my bo=\r\ndy.\n\nCan it be that spirits live in that place disturbing my sleep? There w=\r\nere a few more people staying at that place and everybody had severe proble=\r\nms with sleep, so it&#39;s not just me.\n\nOn the last night I chanted Sri Rudram=\r\n at that place before going to sleep and this was the only night I was able=\r\n to sleep properly.\n\nUpon coming back home from that place I started waking=\r\n up at home, feeling some strong presence - usually some short beings (up t=\r\no 50 cm in height, I&#39;ve seen them before here though); Once the sun rises, =\r\nall of the strange feelings disappear and I can sleep peacefully.\n\nIs there=\r\n any mantra that will protect me from all kinds of astral beings at night? =\r\nSomething that I can chant before going to sleep. This has been bothering m=\r\ne for some time now and it interferes with my life.\n\nThank you in advance!\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
