A short vowel &quot;a&quot; is \ncorrect at the end of &quot;Shiva&quot;, &quot;Raama&quot; etc. If you are already pronouncing \nlike that, then you are fine. I am not sure of the conventions in your part \nof India. But, many north Indians do pronounce it as &quot;Shiv&quot; or &quot;Raam&quot; and \nend the word in a consonant (v or m) without an &quot;a&quot; at the end. THAT is \nwrong.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, January 31, 2009 6:30 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Pronunciation (Re: Kuja (Mars) homam manual \navailable now)\n\n\n&gt; Namaste Narasimha Garu,\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Though the first word in that picture is &quot;shava&quot;, YOU will pronounce\n&gt; it as\n&gt; &quot;shav&quot;. Please note that the second symbol in &quot;shava&quot; is identical to\n&gt; the\n&gt; first symbol in &quot;vasha&quot;. However, YOU end up pronouncing that symbol\n&gt; as &quot;v&quot;\n&gt;&gt;in the first word and as &quot;va&quot; in the second word.\n&gt;\n&gt; When we pronounce first word i.e Shava, we say Shava (va will be\n&gt; pronounciate such that it has a trailing &#39;a&#39; sound)\n&gt;\n&gt; as you said Va in Shava and Va in Vasha should be same, it is agreed\n&gt; but as i mentioned above, I pronounce it the same way in both the\n&gt; words i.e. Shava & Vasha. I can pronounce Va with &#39;a&#39; as a trailing\n&gt; sound. what i didn&#39;t understand is that why i&#39;ll need to pronaunce as\n&gt; Vaa (&#39;aa&#39; as trailing sound). I mean i can pronounce &#39;Shava&#39;\n&gt; comfortably. i don&#39;t end up pronouncing it &#39;v&#39;. in that case why i\n&gt; should make it Vaa sound?\n&gt;\n&gt; When is say Raam (Raama), i pronounce &#39;M&#39; with trailing sound of &#39;a&#39;\n&gt; so the sound of &#39;M&#39; is not abruptly ending but it is completeing with\n&gt; sound of &#39;a&#39;. Same is for Shiva, for Krushna.\n&gt;\n&gt; in all the above, why i need to say &#39;AA&#39; sound at the end.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t pronounce &#39;Va&#39; in 1st & 2nd word as it is given in the 3rd\n&gt; word.\n&gt;\n&gt; For Example take &#39;Tat&#39; from &#39;Om Tat Sat&#39;. First &#39;Ta&#39; has trailing\n&gt; sound of &#39;a&#39; and the next &#39;T&#39; is abruptly ended without trailing\n&gt; sound of &#39;a&#39; and that should be correct i suppose.\n&gt;\n&gt; ***\n&gt; secondly, in the 2nd word, if Va is pronounce as Va (&#39;a&#39; and\n&gt; not &#39;aa&#39;) then in the first word, why i need to say Va as Vaa.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t know if i was clear in what i wanted to convey.\n&gt;\n&gt; yours,\n&gt;\n&gt; utpal\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

It has six words -\n&gt; shava,\n&gt;&gt; vasha, shav, vash, shiva and shiv. Each word is written in\n&gt; Devanagari script\n&gt;&gt; and then in English.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Though the first word in that picture is &quot;shava&quot;, YOU will\n&gt; pronounce it as\n&gt;&gt; &quot;shav&quot;. Please note that the second symbol in &quot;shava&quot; is identical\n&gt; to the\n&gt;&gt; first symbol in &quot;vasha&quot;. However, YOU end up pronouncing that\n&gt; symbol as &quot;v&quot;\n&gt;&gt; in the first word and as &quot;va&quot; in the second word. You pronounce the\n&gt; same\n&gt;&gt; symbol as &quot;va&quot; in some cases and as &quot;v&quot; in some cases. But please\n&gt; note that\n&gt;&gt; Sanskrit is not like English and each symbol has a unique\n&gt; pronunciation. If\n&gt;&gt; you pronounce correctly, that symbol is pronounced identically\n&gt; (as &quot;va&quot;) in\n&gt;&gt; both words. If you really want it to be &quot;v&quot; (without a), it should\n&gt; be\n&gt;&gt; written differently (as at the end of 3rd and 6th words in the\n&gt; picture).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Please go through the six examples carefully to know how to write\n&gt; things in\n&gt;&gt; Devanagari correctly.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Bottomline: Things like &quot;Raam&quot; or &quot;Shiv Uvaach&quot; are wrong and mean\n&gt; nothing\n&gt;&gt; in Sanskrit. The Arabic influence on some modern Indian languages\n&gt; (e.g.\n&gt;&gt; Hindi) that use the same script as Sanskrit corrupted people &#39;s\n&gt;&gt; pronunciation of Sanskrit. What are pronounced by people as &quot;Raam&quot;\n&gt; and &quot;Shiv\n&gt;&gt; Uvaach&quot; should actually be &quot;Raama&quot; and &quot;Shiva Uvaacha&quot;. South\n&gt; Indians have\n&gt;&gt; their own corruptions, but this is a place where south Indians are\n&gt; correct.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Thursday, January 29, 2009 8:13 AM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Kuja (Mars) homam manual available now\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rao Garu!!!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I was always thinking that it is due to South Indian Accent,\n&gt; people\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of that part of india say Raama instead of Raam.

So you may do either.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; However, some combinations tried by others successfully in the\n&gt; past\n&gt;&gt; &gt; are better and faster.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Regarding the specific mantra below: The words &quot;raam&quot; and &quot;jay&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; (or &quot;jai&quot;) have no meaning in Sanskrit. They should be &quot;raama&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and &quot;jaya&quot; respectively. Arabic has words mostly ending in\n&gt; consonants\n&gt;&gt; &gt; (i.e. no vowel &quot;a&quot; at the end of the word). That Arabic influence\n&gt;&gt; &gt; made Indians change Sanskrit words to remove &quot;a&quot; at the end of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; words. &quot;Jaya Raama&quot; becomes &quot;Jay Raam&quot;.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If you want your mantra to be meaningful in Sanskrit, please\n&gt;&gt; &gt; restore &quot;a&quot; at the end of words. The correct version of the mantra\n&gt;&gt; &gt; is &quot;Sree Raama Jaya Raama Jaya Jaya Raama&quot;. You can add &quot;Om&quot; at\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; beginning.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; On our India trip in the summer of 2008, I and my guru went to\n&gt; many\n&gt;&gt; &gt; temples. There was one remote temple in BriahdDwaraka that had a\n&gt; nice\n&gt;&gt; &gt; level of spiritual vibrations. It is a temple of Hanuman and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Makaradhwaja (Hanuman&#39;s son) together. Apparently some yogi did\n&gt;&gt; &gt; intense sadhana there for a few decades in the past (with the\n&gt; mantra\n&gt;&gt; &gt; you mentioned). The mantra above is written all over the walls of\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; temple.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Though that yogi is not there now, the vibrations created by his\n&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana are still there. We were quite impressed when we spent\n&gt; some\n&gt;&gt; &gt; time there. You have to take a boat to go from Dwaarakaa to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; BrihadDwaarakaa and then go inside the village (a few km from the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; main Krishna temple at BrihadDwaarakaa). It is a very small temple\n&gt;&gt; &gt; without any crowd, but has stronger spiritual energy than many\n&gt; famous\n&gt;&gt; &gt; temples. If any of you go to Dwaraka or Gujarat in general, I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; recommend visiting that temple and spending a couple of hours\n&gt; there.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The mantra you gave reminded me of that temple.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; -\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; -\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   From: Jyotisa Shisya\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, January 27, 2009 7:48 AM\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kuja (Mars) homam manual available\n&gt; now\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   |om|\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   Dear Fellow travellers, namaste\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   All this talk about Mangal reminds me about one question I&#39;ve\n&gt; had\n&gt;&gt; &gt; for quite sometime. Sometime ago, Sanjayji had advised me to go to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; any Hanuman temple and get a mantra for lifting up the Mangal in\n&gt; my\n&gt;&gt; &gt; natal chart which suffers from rajabhanga (uccha in rasi and\n&gt; neecha\n&gt;&gt; &gt; in navamsa). When I visited the Hanuman deity in Sri Veetirundha\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Perumal temple, Thirumazhisai near Chennai and asked the priest\n&gt; about\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a mantra, he advised me to chant the mantra inscribed on the\n&gt; walls of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the temple |sri ram jaya ram jaya jaya ram| which comes out to be\n&gt; a 7\n&gt;&gt; &gt; word, 10 aksharas mantra. Energy from the 7th house to the 10th\n&gt; house\n&gt;&gt; &gt; with the mantra devata sitting in lagna as per mantra shastra\n&gt;&gt; &gt; teachings. I&#39;ve been doing this every evening since.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   Later I came to know this is the Rama taraka mantra. My\n&gt; question\n&gt;&gt; &gt; is how does this mantra help to counter the rajabhanga of Mangal?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   Secondly what is the correct form of the Rama taraka mantra?\n&gt; Is it\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   |om sri ram jaya ram jaya jaya ram| - 8 words, 11 aksharas\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   or\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   |om sri rama jaya rama jaya jaya rama|? - 8 words, 14 aksharas\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   Some say it should be 13 aksharas....\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   Sorry for astrological content in this mail.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   best regards\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   Hari\n\n\n"}}
