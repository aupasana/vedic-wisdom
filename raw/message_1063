He was Aarab national and &lt;BR&gt;wanted to=\r\n know something about Hindu religeon. First thing i told him &lt;BR&gt;that &#39;Hind=\r\nu&#39; is a foreign word and none of our scripture uses this &lt;BR&gt;word.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*=\r\n**&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is my long time belief that Sanaatan Dharma will never peris=\r\nh. &lt;BR&gt;my logic is simple. in the recorded history, People from Sanaatan &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;Dharma has never attacked the other religion. The glorious example &lt;BR&gt;(w=\r\nhich i am very proud of quoting) is Paarasi Community. They came to &lt;BR&gt;Ind=\r\nia for saving their community and religeon and our people niether &lt;BR&gt;rejec=\r\nted them nor influenced them to convert in to our religeon. they &lt;BR&gt;flouri=\r\nshed in our country in\n trade.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When Sanaatan Dharma was i=\r\nn great danger, Lord sent Shivaaji to &lt;BR&gt;control it. earlier Addi Shankara=\r\n camedown for it. Now it is our &lt;BR&gt;responsibility to see to it that we liv=\r\ne its value in our life.. and &lt;BR&gt;we need not forget the famous assurance &quot;=\r\nSambhavaami Yuge yuge!&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;but is everybody&#39;s duty to do their bit so t=\r\nhat this glorious &lt;BR&gt;Tradition of Sanaatan Dharam never gets diminished.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;best Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Utpal &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wis=\r\ndom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogr=\r\noups. com&lt;/A&gt;, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ ...&gt; &lt;BR&gt;wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; Namaste&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Very true indeed. Hinduism has f=\r\naced some of the severest assults &lt;BR&gt;across histroy from various groups of=\r\n invaders, we do not have a &lt;BR&gt;central religious authority governing all H=\r\nindus and yet Hinduism &lt;BR&gt;exists inspite of severe persecution that it had=\r\n faced from other\n &lt;BR&gt;religions.=C3=82&nbsp;It is truely amazing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; And this too is correct, as you said, Sanatan Dharma c=\r\nan never &lt;BR&gt;perish. Nature is with him who follows this dharma. Yet, when =\r\nI see &lt;BR&gt;people and there are plenty of them, trying to malign, belittle o=\r\nr &lt;BR&gt;delibetaly spread misinformation and disrespect for Hinduism, it gets=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;a little too much to bear. And then I wonder, inspite of so many &lt;BR&gt;g=\r\nreat great souls having incarnated in this holy land, why does &lt;BR&gt;Sanatan =\r\nDharma=C3=82&nbsp;have to go through such phases.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; Maybe it is the disease of the age we live in. One feels frustated &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nand angry at how things are going and feel like doing something about &lt;BR&gt;i=\r\nt, yet we do not what needs to be done. Nor do we know whether we &lt;BR&gt;are e=\r\nven capable of doing anything.

To Hindus, the &lt;BR&gt;correct term &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; is &quot;sanatana dharma&quot;, i.e. perennial spirit of righteousness. By &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;definition, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; it is perennial. I am firmly convinced that it canno=\r\nt be destroyed. &lt;BR&gt;Even if &lt;BR&gt;&gt; it seems close to extinction, it will =\r\ncome back up.

However, such a &lt;BR&gt;belief is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; vital for some people to disc=\r\nharge *their* dharma and hence we have\n &lt;BR&gt;some &lt;BR&gt;&gt; people driven by =\r\nthat sense of danger and the resulting fear and &lt;BR&gt;anger.
