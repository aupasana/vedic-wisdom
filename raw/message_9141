Can you pls share ur experiences like what changes have come in yo=\r\nu and \n&gt; &gt; all others who r doing chandi homam, pls also share ur experince=\r\ns.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; First let me take it internally. I was proud of my achieve=\r\nments, scholarship and clarity of thinking, several years back. I still am.=\r\n But, when someone bluntly tells me that (very few dare/care to!), it does =\r\nnot upset me but makes me think now.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; I used to experience attac=\r\nks of anger, jealosy, greed, delusion and lust quite\n&gt; &gt; often. I still do.=\r\n But I am able to resist better now and can \n&gt; &gt; recover and move on quickl=\r\ny instead of suffering for a long time.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; I used to readily write=\r\n about some mystical experiences (sometimes in third person, i.e. without s=\r\npecifically mentioning that it was *my* experience), but the motivation was=\r\n not only to inspire others to do sadhana but partly to &quot;impress&quot; others ab=\r\nout my &quot;achievements&quot;. Now, I share something only if I genuinely feel that=\r\n the experience or the disclaimer I mention at the end may inspire or cauti=\r\non or otherwise benefit someone. Now I hardly do it on public forums anyway=\r\n and do it with only a handful of people when an occasion comes.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Now, let me take it externally. When my company closed a business unit ma=\r\nny months back, I had to move from a group where I had some clout to a grou=\r\np where I was new. Though things are the same financially, there is a big c=\r\nhange in the influence. But I am more relaxed than before.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; I wa=\r\ns known as a good scholar and teacher of Jyotish and &quot;chairman&quot; of a Jyotis=\r\nh organization based on a parampara. I am alone now, and not even sure of b=\r\nasic calculations (e.g. ayanamsa, computation of certain divisional charts =\r\netc) even after experimenting with more possibilities than ever. Though I h=\r\nave not fully convinced myself what is correct, I have convinced myself tha=\r\nt whatever is out there is incorrect/incomplete (however, I keep teaching a=\r\nnd giving readings to some people who trust me, based on &quot;my best current u=\r\nnderstanding&quot;). I am more focused than ever in my Jyotish research, but do =\r\nnot feel any undue pressure to solve the puzzles like before.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; P=\r\nrobably this is=A0not=A0what you wanted to hear.. ;-) In any case, differen=\r\nt people may get different results based on their karmas, dasas, gochara et=\r\nc.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; Now, on a serious note, those who are frustrated that their =\r\nsadhana is not producing results may do well to realize that Rome is not bu=\r\nilt in a day. Vasanas that have been reinforced in our consciousness for ma=\r\nny lives cannot be overcome in a few years. Just keep doing sadhana..\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt; Aslo,\n&gt; &gt;  what seems like a loss from one angle may seem from anot=\r\nher angle like liberation from some unneeded baggage. What seems like a gai=\r\nn from \n&gt; &gt; one angle may seem from another angle like an unneeded baggage =\r\nthat bogs one down.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; As I keep insisting, please don&#39;t idolize m=\r\ne or anyone associated with homam movement. The whole idea behind homam is =\r\nthat Agni is the original preceptor of rishis and can ably guide anyone who=\r\n surrenders to Him. Ignore personalities, surrender to Agni and walk your w=\r\nalk.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; --------\n&gt; &gt; Astrolog=\r\ny & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; --------\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n =A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: rakesh.behal &lt;ra=\r\nkesh.behal@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt; &gt;Sent: Sunday, Marc=\r\nh 17, 2013 9:34 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] experiences of Chandi homam=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=A0 \n&gt; &gt; &gt;Dear Narsimha ji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Navratris are abo=\r\nut to come next month.About 6 years have passed since u started doing Chand=\r\ni homam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Can you pls share ur experiences like what changes have=\r\n come in you and all others who r doing chandi homam, pls also share ur exp=\r\nerinces.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;This will be great guidence for others also.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Rakesh\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
