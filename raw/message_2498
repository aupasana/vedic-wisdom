In reality, a deity e=\r\nxisting microcosmically &quot;inside&quot; you, a deity existing microcosmically insi=\r\nde me, a deity existing microcosmically inside someone else and a deity exi=\r\nsting &quot;externally&quot; in the macrocosm (universe) is one and the same and ther=\r\ne is absolutely no difference between all of them! That is essentially the =\r\nUpanishadic understanding.\n \nIn fact, when you say &quot;inside me&quot;, ask yoursel=\r\nf : &quot;what is this I&quot;? Is it the physical body? Is it the subtle body? Is it=\r\n the causal body? When mind entertains the notion that it is a physical bod=\r\ny, it indeed becomes aware of a physical body and looks at it as I. When mi=\r\nnd entertains the notion that it is a subtle body, it indeed becomes aware =\r\nof a subtle body and looks it as I. When mind entertains the notion that it=\r\n is a causal body, it indeed becomes aware of a causal body and looks it as=\r\n I. When mind finally overcomes all such notions one after the other, it ma=\r\ny look at the supra-cosmic body (supreme cosmic being) as I. According to u=\r\npanishadic understanding, there is nothing other than Brahman or supreme co=\r\nsmic being. Thus, expressions like &quot;inside me&quot;, &quot;inside you&quot; and &quot;inside hi=\r\nm&quot; are just expressions that describe false notions rather than reality. Th=\r\nere is no real you, I and he, but there is only a supreme cosmic being.\n \n*=\r\n        *        *\n \nWhen you have a conditioned mind, which has a notion t=\r\nhat there is a certain entity called &quot;Rajarshi Nandy&quot;, an entity called &quot;Na=\r\nrasimha Rao&quot; etc, these entities exist within your mind, for as long as you=\r\nr mind can keep those notions alive. When all such false notions are succes=\r\nsfully eliminated, only supreme cosmic being is left for the mind to focus =\r\non.\n \nWhen a conditioned mind that has a notion that it is a specific perso=\r\nn called &quot;Rajarshi Nandy&quot; in a specific body, such a mind is pre-occupied w=\r\nith so many things that it cannot focus itself on god perfectly. Due to its=\r\n pre-occupations, it can only focus itself on small aspects of god, in a ve=\r\nry limited way. This is like a mirror capturing Sun in a limited way. Sun&#39;s=\r\n image may be reflected on 100 mirrors in 100 ways. One mirror may be broke=\r\nn and dark colored. It may reflect very little sunlight and sun may appear =\r\nbroken. Like that, each mind can focus on god in a different way, to a diff=\r\nerent extent. We express this fact in alternate words by saying &quot;the mind f=\r\nocuses on internal god and he is limited&quot;.\n \nThis is just a simple way to p=\r\nut things. In reality, the issue is not internal vs external. The issue is =\r\nthe mind&#39;s ability to perceive and focus on god. As the mind&#39;s pre-occupati=\r\non with other things comes down and its ability to focus on god goes up, we=\r\n say that the internal god is becoming stronger. Again, this is just a way =\r\nof representation. In reality, god, whether you call him internal or extern=\r\nal, is infinite and does not become weaker or stronger. But mind can focus =\r\nbetter and mind&#39;s idea of god becomes stronger. After all, a dirty mirror r=\r\neflecting Sun may show a dirty and dull Sun at first and show a cleaner and=\r\n brighter Sun after you clean the mirror. Sun has not really become cleaner=\r\n or bighter. He is the same always. We can say &quot;Sun in the mirror&quot; has beco=\r\nme cleaner and brighter. But there is really no Sun &quot;in the&quot; mirror! Though=\r\n we may talk about Sun in mirror 1, Sun in mirror 2, Sun in mirror 3 and th=\r\ne external Sun, they are all one and the same!\n \nThis manner of speaking ab=\r\nout internal vs external god and talking about strengthening internal god i=\r\ns used to simplify things. Bottomline is that any visualization of god by a=\r\n mind is limited by the conditioning, abilities and impurities of that mind=\r\n. By allowing the mind to visualize god, to the best of its ability, on a r=\r\negular basis, we sharpen its ability to visualize god. Eventually, mind los=\r\nes all other pre-occupations and becomes fully absorbed in the infinite god=\r\n. Then we say that internal god has become infinite. This is just a manner =\r\nof speaking.\n \n*        *        *\n \nI want to give a small practical examp=\r\nle, that is somewhat relevant and illustrates some concepts.\n \nOnce a coupl=\r\ne of priests with a high spiritual caliber were conducting a Rudraabhisheka=\r\nm. They were chanting Sree Rudram 11 times. A person who worships Mahaalaks=\r\nhmi was sitting in a corner of the room. He started to meditate with Savitr=\r\nu Gayatri mantra, his favorite mantra. Whichever mantra or deity he worship=\r\ns, he always considers everything to be an offering to Mahalakshmi and imag=\r\nines only her as receiving the mantra. Here also, he was visualizing Mahala=\r\nkshmi as filling his entire being and was offering Gayatri mantra to her. A=\r\nfter a while, his Kundalini rose and his self-awareness was modified. He lo=\r\nst the regular awareness of body, perceived an all-pervading light that he =\r\nwas part of and remained in a nice spiritual state for a while. When he cam=\r\ne back and the pooja was finished, one of the priests described something u=\r\nnusual that he &quot;saw&quot;. In the middle of the pooja, that priest turned toward=\r\ns this person and was surprised by what he saw. He saw a tall 18-handed for=\r\nm of Mahalakshmi standing in the place of this person for a little while.\n =\r\n\nAs that person meditated, his senses turned inward and he was looking inte=\r\nrnally. His mind was focused on Mahaalakshmi, who filled his entire being i=\r\nn his visualization. As Kundalini rose, his distinction of internal and ext=\r\nernal blurred and he perceived himself as *a part* of all-pervading light (=\r\nit is neither &quot;internal&quot; nor &quot;external&quot;). He basically perceived Mahaalaksh=\r\nmi as the all-pervading light that he was also a part of. However, the prie=\r\nst who happened to look at him at that time was also in a purified state an=\r\nd so he noticed something. His mental conditioning at that time made him se=\r\ne a specific external form rather than an all-pervading form. But both the =\r\npriest and the person perceived the same entity in two different ways. One =\r\nwas external and limited. The other was neither internal nor external (but =\r\nobtained by looking internally at first) and unlimited. But, both are the s=\r\name. They appeared different to two minds because of the conditioning of th=\r\nose minds rather than anything else, just as the same Sun may appear differ=\r\nent in two different mirrors!\n \n*        *        *\n \nNo amount of theoriza=\r\ntion will help one fully understand and appreciate things like this. The mo=\r\nst important thing is to do some sadhana, such as homam or meditation, on a=\r\n regular basis. No effort is wasted and eventually gives results when there=\r\n is critical mass. Whatever I say, whatever masters have said before and wh=\r\natever rishis taught in upanishads, can be understood and appreciated throu=\r\ngh direct experience. THAT is the goal of sadhana. Reading scriptures and m=\r\nails like this is only a starting point. One has to engage in some sadhana.=\r\n Even people like Ramana Maharshi, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Trilinga Swami,=\r\n Vivekananda etc did sadhana for many years, before they realized god.\n \nBe=\r\nst regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/hom=\r\nam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpiri=\r\ntuality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (M=\r\nP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www=\r\n.SriJagannath.org\n---------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------- \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n        Namaste Narasimha,\n\n   =\r\n     I little bit of deviation from this topic of this mail.\n\n        There=\r\n is something which I find a little confusion. I hope you will clear that p=\r\noint. You mentioned:\n\n        The god in your homam fire is not an external=\r\n god, but your own internal god. Through your mental focus, you are project=\r\ning the limited manifestation of god inside you into fire and honing your a=\r\nbility to focus the mind on that god. I want to clarify one thing here. Tho=\r\nugh there is actually infinite divinity inside you, your pre-occupation wit=\r\nh so many other things limits (or zeroes) the divinity that your mind can f=\r\nocus on, access and perceive. By focusing on it more and more, you grow it.=\r\n Fire is a good medium to project it for focusing better.\n\n        When we =\r\nare doing a homam or any puja, we are trying to create the deity from withi=\r\nn ourselves where it exists. My questions is, is this where all deities res=\r\nide(inside)? I mean if I am focusing on Mahaganapati, am I just bringing ou=\r\nt the energy of Mahaganapati from inside me or is there one single, univers=\r\nal, omnipotent divinty called Mahaganapati who exists in the universe, and =\r\nI am trying to invite him into the fire?\n\n        I remember a line from Vi=\r\nmalananda where he says, initially we create the deity in the astral body s=\r\no that this deity (the one we projected) may lead us to the real deity who =\r\nexists outside in the universe.\n\n        Did I understand the procedure cor=\r\nrect? Kindly put down your thoughts on this.\n\n        -Regards\n         Raj=\r\narshi\n\n        --- On Thu, 10/9/09, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n          Namaste Krishna Kanth,\n\n          Suppose god really came to =\r\nyour place in a human form and asked you to give him some nice food. Will y=\r\nou allow someone who cooks terribly to cook? Why not allow him to &quot;serve go=\r\nd&quot;?\n\n          It is not just about &quot;serving god&quot;, but serving god *well*. =\r\nA purified servant of god serves god with single-minded focus and devotion =\r\nand has no other thoughts in mind when serving god. A more normal person ma=\r\ny think various things in mind even when serving god. There is some self-ce=\r\nnteredness and ego even in serving god.\n\n          The god in your homam fi=\r\nre is not an external god, but your own internal god. Through your mental f=\r\nocus, you are projecting the limited manifestation of god inside you into f=\r\nire and honing your ability to focus the mind on that god. I want to clarif=\r\ny one thing here. Though there is actually infinite divinity inside you, yo=\r\nur pre-occupation with so many other things limits (or zeroes) the divinity=\r\n that your mind can focus on, access and perceive. By focusing on it more a=\r\nnd more, you grow it. Fire is a good medium to project it for focusing bett=\r\ner. On practice, the divinity inside you that you can focus on and perceive=\r\n grows with time. Thus, remember that what is in fire is the limited manife=\r\nstation of god inside you that you are able to focus, acces and perceive. T=\r\nhis limited divinity should be nurtured slowly and allowed to grow, rather =\r\nthan used up for unnecessary things. When this divinity grows and becomes i=\r\nnfinite, all your desires and other thoughts will vanish and you will be ab=\r\nle to single-mindedly focus on that divinity. Some precautions will help yo=\r\nu in the journey.\n\n          Karmas and thoughts of people who are making o=\r\nfferings in your homam fire are basically being received in your internal g=\r\nod. If he has enough power (his power is, after all, the power of *your own=\r\n* focus!) to grant a specific desire of someone, he may just do it. But tha=\r\nt makes him weaker and who knows whether the desire was worthwhile?!\n\n     =\r\n     Of course, when you are offering things in fire, you yourself may have=\r\n some unnecessary desires which may slow down the spiritual progress. But, =\r\nthat is a necessary evil and there is no escape. But, why let someone else&#39;=\r\ns desires cause an extra slow down?\n\n          Thus, this is not a matter o=\r\nf political correctness and being nice.\n\n          However, there is alread=\r\ny a lot of karmic intermixing between people very closely connected to one =\r\nkarmically, like wife, children and parents. Wife&#39;s desires may affect husb=\r\nand&#39;s desires and mother&#39;s desires may affect son&#39;s desires already (atleas=\r\nt in a closely bonded and old-fashioned families). So there is no significa=\r\nnt drawback to allowing them to share fire.\n\n          Bottomline:\n\n       =\r\n   If some people are so close to you that you want to allow their karmas a=\r\nnd their desires to affect your spiritual progress and slow you down, then =\r\nallow such people to offer in your homam fire. Even if you do not allow spe=\r\ncifically, some close people&#39;s karmas and desires may already be directly a=\r\nffecting your own karmas and desires and hence slowing you down!\n\n         =\r\n Usually, that would be immediate family, but you know your situation bette=\r\nr.\n\n          Best regards,\n          Narasimha\n\n          ---- naaraayana_=\r\niyer &lt;narayan.iyer@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: \n          &gt; Namaste Shri Krishna Kan=\r\nth,\n          &gt; \n          &gt; I am sure Narasimha meant outside of your imme=\r\ndiate family.

What this namboodiri did is=\r\n the correct way.\n          &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; Visualize the external fire =\r\nas your internal fire and worship it. Then offerings in it will kindle your=\r\n internal fire and streamline it, depending on how strong your identificati=\r\non is (it will get stronger with practice). If anyone handles that external=\r\n fire or makes offerings in it, some karmas will be submitted by that perso=\r\nn to your internal fire for burning. This intermingling of karmas can be al=\r\nlowed for people whose karmas are anyway intertwined, like husband and wife=\r\n or parents and children. Of course, you can also take on karmas from the e=\r\nntire world if you are ready and willing to face their consequences, but a =\r\nperson with a strong individualized ego should limit the karmas one faces a=\r\nnd work on erasing that ego. When one&#39;s ego becomes very subtle, it may be =\r\npossible to take on more karmas and face their consequences. After all, if =\r\nyou start plucking leaves, flowers and fruits from a small plant, it will d=\r\nie. If you guard it and let it grow very\n          &gt; &gt; big, it can give flo=\r\nwers and fruits to many more people. So, until you become very pure, keep w=\r\norking to burn your karmas and free yourself from the vaasanas (mental cond=\r\nitioning) caused by them.\n          &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; But some people use =\r\nfire in the same way an idol is used. They allow anyone to start the fire i=\r\nn their homam, handle the fire and make offerings in it etc. If one who str=\r\nongly identifies one&#39;s internal fire with external fire does such things, i=\r\nt can be disastrous. However, luckily, most people who follow this approach=\r\n do not understand much about fire and do not have a strong identification =\r\nwith the fire. So, fire is practically like an idol for them and they do no=\r\nt benefit from fire as much as one can. Thus, allowing everyone to start or=\r\n handle or making offerings into you fire can be inefficient at best and di=\r\nsastrous at worst.\n          &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; The best approach is: You s=\r\ntart your own fire. Only you handle it. Only you make offerings in it. In y=\r\nour mind, identify it with your own internal fire (bhootaagni) that burns i=\r\nn the subtle body. If you do this for a while, a strong bond is indeed form=\r\ned.

Placing a l=\r\netter in a particular body part has a higher significance than just touchin=\r\ng a body part and saying the letter. Visualizing a specific body part vibra=\r\nting with a specific sound is possible only after one makes sufficient prog=\r\nress in purifying one&#39;s subtle perception.

Again, thi=\r\ns is \njust a way of representation. In reality, god, whether you call him i=\r\nnternal or \nexternal, is infinite and does not become weaker or stronger. B=\r\nut mind can focus \nbetter and mind&#39;s idea of god becomes stronger. After al=\r\nl, a dirty mirror \nreflecting Sun may show a dirty and dull Sun at first an=\r\nd show a cleaner and \nbrighter Sun after you clean the mirror. Sun has not =\r\nreally become cleaner or \nbighter. He is the same always. We can say &quot;Sun i=\r\nn the mirror&quot; has become \ncleaner and brighter. But there is really no Sun =\r\n&quot;in the&quot; mirror!

By allowing the mind to=\r\n \nvisualize god, to the best of its ability, on a regular basis, we sharpen=\r\n its \nability to visualize god.

They were chanting Sree \nRud=\r\nram 11 times. A person who worships Mahaalakshmi was sitting in a corner of=\r\n \nthe room. He started to meditate with Savitru Gayatri mantra, his favorit=\r\ne \nmantra. Whichever mantra or deity he worships, he always considers every=\r\nthing to \nbe an offering to Mahalakshmi and imagines only her as receiving =\r\nthe mantra. \nHere also, he was visualizing Mahalakshmi as filling his entir=\r\ne being and was \noffering Gayatri mantra to her. After a while, his Kundali=\r\nni rose and his \nself-awareness was modified. He lost the regular awareness=\r\n of body, perceived an \nall-pervading light that he was part of and remaine=\r\nd in a nice spiritual state \nfor a while. When he came back and the pooja w=\r\nas finished, one of the priests \ndescribed something unusual that he &quot;saw&quot;.=\r\n In the middle of the pooja, that \npriest turned towards this person and wa=\r\ns surprised by what he saw.

His mind was focused =\r\non \nMahaalakshmi, who filled his entire being in his visualization.

His mental conditioning at that \ntime&nbsp;made him see a specific&nbsp=\r\n;external form rather than an \nall-pervading form.

Will \n          you allow someone who cooks terribly to cook? Wh=\r\ny not allow him to \n          &quot;serve god&quot;?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is not just about &quot;ser=\r\nving god&quot;, but serving \n          god *well*. A purified servant of god ser=\r\nves god with single-minded \n          focus and devotion and has no other t=\r\nhoughts in mind when serving god. \n          A more normal person may think=\r\n various things in mind even when \n          serving god. There is some sel=\r\nf-centeredness and ego even in serving \n          god.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The god in yo=\r\nur homam fire is not an external god, but \n          your own internal god.=\r\n Through your mental focus, you are projecting \n          the limited manif=\r\nestation of god inside you into fire and honing your \n          ability to =\r\nfocus the mind on that god. I want to clarify one thing \n          here. Th=\r\nough there is actually infinite divinity inside you, your \n          pre-oc=\r\ncupation with so many other things limits (or zeroes) the \n          divini=\r\nty that your mind can focus on, access and perceive. By focusing \n         =\r\n on it more and more, you grow it. Fire is a good medium to project it \n   =\r\n       for focusing better. On practice, the divinity inside you that you c=\r\nan \n          focus on and perceive grows with time. Thus, remember that wh=\r\nat is in \n          fire is the limited manifestation of god inside you tha=\r\nt you are able \n          to focus, acces and perceive. This limited divini=\r\nty should be nurtured \n          slowly and allowed to grow, rather than us=\r\ned up for unnecessary \n          things. When this divinity grows and becom=\r\nes infinite, all your \n          desires and other thoughts will vanish and=\r\n you will be able to \n          single-mindedly focus on that divinity. Som=\r\ne precautions will help you \n          in the journey.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Karmas and th=\r\noughts of people who are making \n          offerings in your homam fire are=\r\n basically being received in your \n          internal god. If he has enough=\r\n power (his power is, after all, the \n          power of *your own* focus!)=\r\n to grant a specific desire of someone, he \n          may just do it. But t=\r\nhat makes him weaker and who knows whether the \n          desire was worthw=\r\nhile?!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Of course, when you are offering things \n          in fire, y=\r\nou yourself may have some unnecessary desires which may slow \n          dow=\r\nn the spiritual progress. But, that is a necessary evil and there \n        =\r\n  is no escape. But, why let someone else&#39;s desires cause an extra slow \n  =\r\n        down?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thus, this is not a matter of political correctness an=\r\nd \n          being nice.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;However, there is already a lot of karmic \n=\r\n          intermixing between people very closely connected to one karmical=\r\nly, \n          like wife, children and parents. Wife&#39;s desires may affect h=\r\nusband&#39;s \n          desires and mother&#39;s desires may affect son&#39;s desires a=\r\nlready (atleast \n          in a closely bonded and old-fashioned families).=\r\n So there is no \n          significant drawback to allowing them to share \n=\r\n          fire.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bottomline:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If some people are so close to yo=\r\nu \n          that you want to allow their karmas and their desires to affec=\r\nt your \n          spiritual progress and slow you down, then allow such peo=\r\nple to offer \n          in your homam fire. Even if you do not allow specif=\r\nically, some close \n          people&#39;s karmas and desires may already be di=\r\nrectly affecting your own \n          karmas and desires and hence slowing y=\r\nou down!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Usually, that \n          would be immediate family, but you=\r\n know your situation \n          better.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---- naaraayana_iyer \n          &lt;&lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://in.m=\r\nc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dnarayan.iyer%40gmail.com&quot; \n          tar=\r\nget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow \n          ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:narayan.iyer%40gma=\r\nil.com&quot;&gt;narayan.iyer@ \n          gmail.com&lt;/A&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste =\r\nShri Krishna Kanth,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I am sure Narasimha meant o=\r\nutside of your immediate family. \n          Immediate family includes spous=\r\ne, children and parents.

W=\r\nhat this namboodiri did \n          is the correct way.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; Visualize the external \n          fire as your internal fire and wor=\r\nship it. Then offerings in it will \n          kindle your internal fire and=\r\n streamline it, depending on how strong \n          your identification is (=\r\nit will get stronger with practice). If anyone \n          handles that exte=\r\nrnal fire or makes offerings in it, some karmas will \n          be submitte=\r\nd by that person to your internal fire for burning. This \n          intermi=\r\nngling of karmas can be allowed for people whose karmas are \n          anyw=\r\nay intertwined, like husband and wife or parents and children. Of \n        =\r\n  course, you can also take on karmas from the entire world if you are \n   =\r\n       ready and willing to face their consequences, but a person with a \n =\r\n         strong individualized ego should limit the karmas one faces and wo=\r\nrk \n          on erasing that ego. When one&#39;s ego becomes very subtle, it m=\r\nay be \n          possible to take on more karmas and face their consequence=\r\ns. After \n          all, if you start plucking leaves, flowers and fruits f=\r\nrom a small \n          plant, it will die. If you guard it and let it grow =\r\nvery&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          big, it can give flowers and fruits to many mo=\r\nre people. So, until you \n          become very pure, keep working to burn =\r\nyour karmas and free yourself \n          from the vaasanas (mental conditio=\r\nning) caused by them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; But some people=\r\n use fire in the same way an idol is \n          used. They allow anyone to =\r\nstart the fire in their homam, handle the \n          fire and make offering=\r\ns in it etc. If one who strongly identifies \n          one&#39;s internal fire =\r\nwith external fire does such things, it can be \n          disastrous. Howev=\r\ner, luckily, most people who follow this approach do \n          not underst=\r\nand much about fire and do not have a strong identification \n          with=\r\n the fire. So, fire is practically like an idol for them and they \n        =\r\n  do not benefit from fire as much as one can. Thus, allowing everyone \n   =\r\n       to start or handle or making offerings into you fire can be \n       =\r\n   inefficient at best and disastrous at worst.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n    =\r\n      &gt; The best approach is: You start your own fire. Only you handle \n=\r\n          it. Only you make offerings in it. In your mind, identify it with=\r\n your \n          own internal fire (bhootaagni) that burns in the subtle bo=\r\ndy. If you \n          do this for a while, a strong bond is indeed formed. =\r\nWithout your \n          knowledge, the internal fire will become strong and=\r\n burn various \n          vaasanas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (2) There are=\r\n different methods \n          for beeja, shakti and keelakam, though anga n=\r\nyaasa and kara nyaasa are \n          usually standard.. Do not worry about =\r\nthese things and do what you are \n          used to or what you are more at=\r\ntracted to.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          As I said many times, the=\r\nse nyaasas are just formality for most \n          people. Placing a letter =\r\nin a particular body part has a higher \n          significance than just to=\r\nuching a body part and saying the letter. \n          Visualizing a specific=\r\n body part vibrating with a specific sound is \n          possible only afte=\r\nr one makes sufficient progress in purifying one&#39;s \n          subtle percep=\r\ntion.
