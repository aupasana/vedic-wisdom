The atman is entirely opposed to action \n  \nFirst of all, n=\r\note one fact. Long after becoming a sannyasin, Swami Sivananda \ntravelled t=\r\nhe world, wrote books, gave lectures and founded Divine Life Society, \namon=\r\ng other &quot;actions&quot;! :-) \n\n  \n*        *        * \n  \nIf he established DLS w=\r\nith the expectation that it becomes a success or 10,000 \npeople join it or =\r\nsome such thing, then it would become an ignorant action, i.e. \naction with=\r\n attachment. If he did the action completely ready for any outcome \nand wit=\r\nhout a sense of ownership, and as an instrument of the divine will, then \ni=\r\nt is neither &quot;worldly&quot; nor binding nor ignorant. The problem is not &quot;action=\r\ns&quot;, \nbut actions with attachment and a sense of ownership, i.e. actions dri=\r\nven by the \nwill and agenda of a limited ego. \n\n  \nActions should not be sp=\r\noken ill of like this. Detached action is a *sacred \nduty* of every being. =\r\nGods and rishis came back again and again to earth to \nengage in detached a=\r\nction. \n\n  \n*        *        * \n  \nIf &quot;the atman is entirely opposed to ac=\r\ntion&quot;, then why is atman (Self) even \nallowing action? Why doesn&#39;t it simpl=\r\ny halt everything? Or, is all the action \nhappening outside of atman? Is th=\r\nere anything outside of atman at all? \n\n  \nSome buddhist philosophies coine=\r\nd the term anatman (non-Self) to describe \ntransient things. But, in Vedic =\r\nphilosophy, there is no anatman. All that is is \natman (Self). Ocean is per=\r\nmanent and still, but ripples that arise in it are \ntransient and moving. B=\r\nut ripples are part of ocean only and you do not start \nlabeling ripples as=\r\n &quot;non-ocean&quot;. \n\n  \nAtman or Purusha or Shiva is the potential energy of thi=\r\ns cosmos, while Maya or \nPrakriti or Shakti is the kinetic energy of this c=\r\nosmos. Shiva and Shakti are \nseen as different entities by some people, but=\r\n rishis have declared their \noneness. Potential energy becomes kinetic ener=\r\ngy and vice versa. \n\n  \nAtman is the still ocean and Maya is the force (kin=\r\netic) that gives rise to \nmoving ripples on the surface. A ripple that exer=\r\nts itself to move in a \nparticular way keeps colliding with the force and k=\r\neeps moving hither and tither \nin a chaotic way for a very long time. A rip=\r\nple that does not exert itself and \nmoves smoothly as dictated by the force=\r\n will eventually grind to a halt and \ncease to exist as a ripple on the sur=\r\nface. It then becomes part of the still \nocean. If a ripple exerts itself t=\r\no become still, it may even take longer to \nbecome still. What prolongs a r=\r\nipple is not movement but resisting the direction \ngiven by the force and e=\r\nxerting to move in a particular way (or even exerting to \nbecome still). A =\r\nripple that surrenders to the force will ride the course and \ndie down fast=\r\ner. \n\n  \nContemplate the imagery I presented above regarding Atman and Maya=\r\n, \nignorant/egoistic action and detached action! It is very apt. \n\n  \n*    =\r\n    *        * \n  \nIn not-so-distant past, sannyasins remained in ashrams a=\r\nnd isolated themselves \nfrom society and did their sadhana. Swami Vivekanan=\r\nda started a new trend. \n\n  \nA sannyasin renounces expectation of things fr=\r\nom people stuck in transient \nmaterial world and does not depend on anyone.=\r\n But he may still *give* basic \nmaterial things to those hapless people stu=\r\nck in transient material world! For \nexample, Swami Vivekananda and his bro=\r\nther monks went to places struck by \nplague, floods, droughts, cyclones etc=\r\n and served people. They provided food, \nmedicines etc (instead of lecturin=\r\ng that body is a transient illusion and one \nshould stop worrying about its=\r\n welfare!) and also did construction work. They \nignored the welfare of the=\r\nir own bodies, put themselves at risk and overcame \nmaya personally. But th=\r\ney served those still stuck in maya without looking down \nupon them or thei=\r\nr needs or maya that trapped them! Those who wanted food got \nfood, those w=\r\nho wanted medicines got medicines and those who wanted books got \nbooks. Re=\r\nnunciation means you do not expect anything from anyone and accept \nwhateve=\r\nr comes to you naturally. It does not necessarily mean rejecting or \nignori=\r\nng others. Overcoming maya does not require belittling maya or belittling \n=\r\nthose still stuck in maya. \n\n  \nThe trend started by Swami Vivekananda was =\r\ncontinued by Swami Sivananda. For \nthat reason, it is a bit weird to see hi=\r\nm talking so ill of action! He was \nobviously trying to inspire a specific =\r\ngroup of people for a specific body of \nwork. These words are neither unive=\r\nrsal nor do they reflect his tremendous \nwisdom I have seen elsewhere! \n\n  =\r\n\n*        *        * \n  \nAll this intellectual discussion may be satisfying=\r\n to some, but the quote from \nSwami Brahmanananda in the other mail is very=\r\n apt: &quot;You have been only hearing \nof all these spiritual things. Now reali=\r\nse them. You have done enough study and \nreasoning. Now do some spiritual p=\r\nractice. First take up that aspect of God \nwhich appeals to you most. Follo=\r\nw your own path of Sadhana. When you realise God \nthrough it, you will feel=\r\n the joy of realising Him also in other aspects and \nthrough other paths.&quot; =\r\n\n\n  \nAccording to Ramakrishna, Swami Brahmananda was a gopala who accompani=\r\ned Lord \nKrishna in a previous life. His words are simple, pragmatic and po=\r\nwerful. \n\n  \nI want this forum to facilitate exchange of Vedic knowledge (a=\r\nnd I will also be \ncontributing, though in spurts). But I want more that th=\r\nis forum should inspire \npeople to do sadhana and find God.

A ripple that does not exert itself and moves=\r\n smoothly as dictated by the force will eventually grind to a halt and ceas=\r\ne to exist as a ripple on the surface. It then becomes part of the still oc=\r\nean. If a ripple exerts itself to become still, it may even take longer to =\r\nbecome still. What prolongs a ripple is not movement but resisting the dire=\r\nction given by the force and exerting to move in a particular way (or even =\r\nexerting to become still).

But he may still *give* basic materi=\r\nal things to those hapless people stuck in transient material world! For ex=\r\nample, Swami Vivekananda and his brother monks went to places struck by pla=\r\ngue, floods, droughts, cyclones etc and served people. They provided food, =\r\nmedicines etc (instead of lecturing that body is a transient illusion and o=\r\nne should stop worrying about its welfare!) and also did construction work.=\r\n They ignored the welfare of their own bodies, put themselves at risk and o=\r\nvercame maya personally. But they served those still stuck in maya without =\r\nlooking down upon them or their needs or maya that trapped them! Those who =\r\nwanted food got food, those who wanted medicines got medicines and those wh=\r\no wanted books got books. Renunciation means you do not expect anything fro=\r\nm anyone and accept whatever comes to you naturally. It does not necessaril=\r\ny mean rejecting or\n ignoring others.

The sruti says: =C3=A2Let one live in the order of sannyasa which is=\r\n a means to the knowledge of Brahman.=C3=A2 Brahmacharya may help one to at=\r\ntain knowledge but it is not the case with a householder. When a means is n=\r\not properly followed it can never accomplish any object. The heavenly bliss=\r\n of the karma-kandin is only a form of worldly enjoyment. Heaven is only an=\r\nother world. If one professes to have knowledge he cannot do actions, for a=\r\nctions are worldly. The atman is entirely opposed to action and hence it\n c=\r\nannot be an auxiliary to the knowledge of it. The sruti says: =C3=A2When to=\r\n him everything has become the Self, who should see what and through what s=\r\nhould one see?=C3=A2 etc. This nullifies the meaning of actions in one who =\r\nhas knowledge. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-1884322570-1308619714=:18138--\r\n\n"}}
