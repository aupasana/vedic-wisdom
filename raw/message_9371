Is =\r\nit ok if I do mantra japa lying on bed comfortably? Or \nshould it always be=\r\n in a a seated positon? Because, lying on \nbed comfortably, I can do far mo=\r\nre number of rounds than \nsitting up. Also, I can concentrate entirely on m=\r\nantra being \nchanted that way. Also I read somewhere Anga nyasa, Kara \nnyas=\r\na etc.are not necessary, just chanting the specified \nmantra is adequate. W=\r\nhat&#39;s your opinion on this?\n\n\n\n"}}
