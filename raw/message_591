Rao&quot; \n&lt;pvr@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) No. Any food offered as bali (as opposed to &quot;nai=\r\nvedyam&quot; to a \ndeity) is \n&gt; usually not consumed. It is thrown away. If you =\r\nlive in woods, \nthrow it away \n&gt; in the open so animals can eat it. Otheriw=\r\nse, throw it in garbage.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the other hand, &quot;naivedyam&quot; offered to god=\r\n can be consumed by \npeople as \n&gt; prasad.\n&gt; \n&gt; (2) Either is fine. They sym=\r\nbolize the path of shakti moving from \nyou to the \n&gt; fire and vice versa.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; (3) Either is fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; (4) Whether it is our bodies or flowers/akshat=\r\nas used in a pooja, \neverything \n&gt; has a purpose and it has to go when its =\r\npurpose is served. That&#39;s \nthe nature \n&gt; of life. While the flowers and aks=\r\nhatas are used in homam, they \nare \n&gt; sacrosanct and should be handled with=\r\n care, love and respect. \nAfter they \n&gt; serve their purpose, they have to b=\r\ne disposed of however one can. \nThrowing \n&gt; in garbage is fine if you ask m=\r\ne. Another way is to collect them \nin a bag \n&gt; until you accumulate a good =\r\namount and burn them oneday. If you \nhave a local \n&gt; temple, you can go and=\r\n see if you can throw them wherever they \nthrow the \n&gt; flowers etc they use=\r\n at the temple.\n&gt; \n&gt; The ashes from the homam are considered sacred. They c=\r\nontain \n*some* of the \n&gt; energy generated from the homam. The best way to d=\r\nispose the ashes \nis to \n&gt; throw them into a flowing stream of water (a riv=\r\ner or an ocean). \nThis \n&gt; ensures that the energy is not localized to one p=\r\nlace and is \ndistributed \n&gt; back to the Nature. Another thing some people d=\r\no is to dig a deep \npit in the \n&gt; yard and bury the ashes. It restricts the=\r\n energy to the place and \nnot a \n&gt; great idea. Please remember that the ene=\r\nrgy in the ashes is only a \n*part* of \n&gt; the energy generated. Some energy =\r\nis also within the person \nperforming homam \n&gt; and helps to purify the pers=\r\non. Giving some part back to the \nnature is a \n&gt; very good idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best =\r\nregards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/=\r\nhomam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n=\r\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish l=\r\nessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (W=\r\nindows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) websit=\r\ne: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------ \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;utpal=\r\n pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Sa=\r\nturday, November 01, 2008 7:18 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] questions w.r.t=\r\n. Homam!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Narasimha Garu,\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; my Apology for se=\r\nnding the Jyotisha content in this forum.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; few questions are arising=\r\n while doing Homam which is listed as \nunder;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1)&#39;Suddhaanna Bali&#39; o=\r\nfferings for Parshadas can be consumed \nlater on\n&gt; &gt; by people as Prasad?\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2) &#39;Two parallel lines&#39; from Homam Kund to Aaasan can be \npermanent\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; or required to draw fresh everytime? what does those lines mean?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; 3) &#39;Remains in Homa Kunad&#39; can be used as *Raksha* or Raksha is \nonly\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n considered which is obtained from the procedure given.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 4) The prob=\r\nlem of disposal of Nirmaalya (Remains of Homam-such as\n&gt; &gt; flowers, Akshata=\r\nas, etc..)is a issue especially in the city \nwhere i\n&gt; &gt; stay, due to local=\r\n restrictions. to put it in a normal garbage is\n&gt; &gt; difficult physcological=\r\nly. any suggetions from anybody?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------\n-\n&gt; &gt; I need to share my experience about D=\r\nry coconut pieces. If one \ntakes\n&gt; &gt; a Dray coconut Half and presses it by =\r\nholding in both Palms, \nit&#39;ll\n&gt; &gt; break in to 3 to 4 pieces. if required, o=\r\nne can further make one \nor\n&gt; &gt; two pieces from those again by breaking it =\r\nby using palms. I&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; experinced that those pieces works out to be very =\r\nuseful (Size \nwise)\n&gt; &gt; to sustain fire for long time hence one can concent=\r\nrate more in\n&gt; &gt; reciting Mantra then worrying about sustainance of fire. t=\r\nhe \nanother\n&gt; &gt; important advantage is that use of Knife can be completely =\r\n\navoided.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; just one input if it helps some..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; utpal\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
