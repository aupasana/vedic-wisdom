When one perfor=\r\nms a sadhana, it is only\n\nto achieve\n\n&gt; &gt; some goal whether that be spiritu=\r\nal or material objective and the\n\nneed for\n\n&gt; &gt; sadhana is becuase the nati=\r\nve feels that otherwise he/she may not be\n\nable\n\n&gt; &gt; to=C3=82 achive the go=\r\nal easily. So essentially the purpose of a\n\nsadhana is to remove\n\n&gt; &gt; the k=\r\narmic burden towards achieving the goal. Law of karma does not\n\nlet anyone\n=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; of the hook though. The harships that you face while performing a\n\nsad=\r\nhana might\n\n&gt; &gt; appear like a &quot;test&quot; to a sadhaka but is essentially the Lo=\r\nrd\n\nbringing necessary\n\n&gt; &gt; hardships your way which creates the suffering =\r\nin the sadhaka that\n\nlets the\n\n&gt; &gt; sadhaka shed some of the karma. The sadh=\r\naka will eventually be\n\nsuccessful but\n\n&gt; &gt; the effort required and the har=\r\ndships that are yet to be faced\n\ndepends on the\n\n&gt; &gt; karmic burden.\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; If the karmic burden is less, suffering is less and success is\n\nobtained=\r\n without\n\n&gt; &gt; much suffering (relatively speaking). If the karmic burden is=\r\n very\n\nheavy, you\n\n&gt; &gt; may suffer without seeing any success. Though you ar=\r\ne now closer to\n\nyour goal\n\n&gt; &gt; after the suffering, but since the goal is =\r\nnot achieved, you do not\n\nsee the\n\n&gt; &gt; results of your effort and feel the =\r\neffort was a waste.\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; MA does not tests...the hardships are brought=\r\n to your way by her to\n\npurge you\n\n&gt; &gt; karmically to let you achieve what y=\r\nou want.\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; This is my belief, and this I use as a basis when perfor=\r\nming a\n\nsadhana.

&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; then again...i was against krishna worshi=\r\np.....cuzz i thot\n\nfooshingly since he\n\n&gt; &gt; is only about love(bhakti)....h=\r\ne may not be strong like devis..\n\n&gt; &gt;

So e=\r\nssentially the purpose of a&lt;br&gt;\nsadhana is to remove&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the karm=\r\nic burden towards achieving the goal. Law of karma does not&lt;br&gt;\nlet anyone&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; of the hook though. The harships that you face while performi=\r\nng a&lt;br&gt;\nsadhana might&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; appear like a &quot;test&quot; to a sadhaka but =\r\nis essentially the Lord&lt;br&gt;\nbringing necessary&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; hardships your=\r\n way which creates the suffering in the sadhaka that&lt;br&gt;\nlets the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; sadhaka shed some of the karma. The sadhaka will eventually be&lt;br&gt;\nsuc=\r\ncessful but&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the effort required and the hardships that are ye=\r\nt to be faced&lt;br&gt;\ndepends on the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; karmic burden.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If the karmic burden is less, suffering is less and success =\r\nis&lt;br&gt;\nobtained without&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; much suffering (relatively speaking).=\r\n If the karmic burden is very&lt;br&gt;\nheavy, you&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; may suffer witho=\r\nut seeing any success. Though you are now closer to&lt;br&gt;\nyour goal&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; after the suffering, but since the goal is not achieved, you do not&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nsee the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; results of your effort and feel the effort was a wa=\r\nste.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; MA does not tests...the hardships are brou=\r\nght to your way by her to&lt;br&gt;\npurge you&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; karmically to let you=\r\n achieve what you want.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is my belief, and =\r\nthis I use as a basis when performing a&lt;br&gt;\nsadhana. I am&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; sur=\r\ne others may have other views though.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards,&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bhupendra.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: pa=\r\nrijat_d parijat_d@&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:=\r\nvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3D=\r\nvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; Sent: Wed, September 29, 2010 4:20:17 PM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-=\r\nwisdom] A query&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; i am parijat dutta from kolkata.there are some issues going on=\r\n i&lt;br&gt;\nneed to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; discuss..&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; since i =\r\nwas 18-19,i became interested in tantras.and i worship ma&lt;br&gt;\nkali.bt i fee=\r\nl&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; i had and may be have to face several tests....like initial=\r\nly...i&lt;br&gt;\nread books on&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; tantra....wich promise highly materi=\r\nalistically beneficial&lt;br&gt;\nsadhanas..&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; and alarmingly differen=\r\nt dieties for each purpose...i fell for&lt;br&gt;\nthat...an my&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; devo=\r\ntion was divided...between maa kali,durga,laxmi,hanumanji..&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; with time i realized all these have no value without a gurus&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nguidance.....my&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; astrologer told me....that time will be ar=\r\nnd 29-30 of my age.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; then again...i was against =\r\nkrishna worship.....cuzz i thot&lt;br&gt;\nfooshingly since he&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; is on=\r\nly about love(bhakti)....he may not be strong like devis..&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ag=\r\nain since...all the tridevs need shakti...so i felt shakti worship&lt;br&gt;\nis t=\r\nhe&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; highest....&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; un&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; also...at that =\r\ntime..i didnot like ramkrishna dev since he talked&lt;br&gt;\nmostly of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; devotion...n not of powers like siddhis....&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; undestanding =\r\nothers thoughts n so on...as i have personally seen&lt;br&gt;\nsome tantrics&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; who have this power..&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; with time again =\r\ni learnt bhakti is the highest.......i asked once a&lt;br&gt;\nmaharaj who&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; presides over the ashram where my mother was initiated ...&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; which is more powerful ??
