Just as the dreamer is not to be conf=\r\nounded\nwith the dream so is the Lord not to be confounded with the creation=\r\n. Just\nas a man survives his dream, so does the Lord survive the dissolutio=\r\nn of His\ncreation. Just as you remain ever as pure consciousness apart from=\r\n the body,\netc., so is the Lord, unbounded consciousness apart from the uni=\r\nverse, etc.\nIs it not after all only a picture drawn by Him on His Self? Ho=\r\nw can this\nunique creation be apart from Him? There can indeed be nothing b=\r\nut\nconsciousness. Tell me of any place where there is no consciousness; the=\r\nre\nis no place beyond consciousness. Or can anyone prove in any manner anyt=\r\nhing\noutside consciousness? Consciousness is inescapable.\n\nMoreover, this c=\r\nonsciousness is the only existence,covering the whole\nuniverse, and perfect=\r\n all through.Just as there cannot be breakers apart\nfrom the ocean and ligh=\r\nt without the Sun, so also the universe cannot be\nconceived without conscio=\r\nusness. The Supreme God is thus the embodiment of\npure Consciousness.\n\nThe =\r\nuniverse has thus originated only as an image on the surface of the\nmirror =\r\nof the Absolute. This conclusion is in harmony with all facts.\n\nCreation is=\r\n like a magician=92s trick, and is a city born of divine\nimagination. O Par=\r\nasurama, you are aware of the mental creations of\ndaydreamers which are ful=\r\nl of people, life and work, similar to this. There\nare also doubts,tests, d=\r\niscussions and conclusions =97 all imaginary arising\nin the mind and subsid=\r\ning there. Just as castles in the air are mental\nfigments of men so also is=\r\n this creation a mental figment of Siva. Siva is\nabsolute Awareness, withou=\r\nt any form. Sri Tripura is Sakti (energy) and\nWitness of the whole.That Bei=\r\nng is perfect all round and remains undivided.\n\nThe world cannot stand inve=\r\nstigation because of its changing unreal nature.\nJust as the owl is dazzled=\r\n and blinded by bright sunlight, so the world\nparades in glory before ignor=\r\nance and disappears before right analysis.\n\n[Note: The man sees by sunlight=\r\n and is helpless in its absence. The owl sees\nin darkness and is blinded in=\r\n sunlight. Whose sight is the better of the\ntwo? This cannot be determined =\r\nsatisfactorily so that investigation becomes\nlame.]\n\n\nAs long as the ignora=\r\nnce of the self lasts, so long will there be misery.\n\nThe Sun helps all to =\r\nsee, but blinds the owls; water is the abode of fishes,\nbut drowns man; fir=\r\ne burns a man, but is food to tittiri (a species of\nbird); fire is ordinari=\r\nly put out by water, but it flourishes in the middle\nof the ocean at the ti=\r\nme of dissolution. Similar discrepancies are evident\nelsewhere.\n\nMen and an=\r\nimals engage in activities with their limbs and senses, whereas\nspirits do =\r\nso with the bodies of others. Instances like these are\ninnumerable.\n\nSight =\r\nis of the eye and cannot be without it.A jaundiced eye sees everything\nyell=\r\now and diplopia produces a double image of a single object.\n\nAbnormal visio=\r\nns are thus the direct result of abnormal eyes. The\nKarandakas, in an Easte=\r\nrn island, are said to see everything red; so also\nthe inhabitants of Raman=\r\naka Isle see everything upside down.\n\nOne hears many more strange stories o=\r\nf the kind, all of which are based on\nabnormalities of vision. They can all=\r\n be remedied by proper treatment. The\nsame applies to other senses,includin=\r\ng the mind.\n\nThe relation between space and objects and between time and ev=\r\nents is\naccording to your estimate of them; there is no intrinsic relations=\r\nhip\nbetween them.\n\nJust as the mirror remains unaffected by the passage of =\r\ndifferent images and\nyet continues to reflect as clearly as before, so also=\r\n the one consciousness\nillumines the waking and dream states which can be v=\r\nerified by proper\nmeditation.\n\nTherefore recognise the fact that the world =\r\nis simply an image on the mirror\nof consciousness and cultivate the contemp=\r\nlation of =91I am=92, abide as pure\nbeing and thus give up this delusion of=\r\n the reality of the world.\n\n\nTrue experience of the Self is the unawareness=\r\n of even =91I am=92. Can the world\npersist after such unawareness? Second-h=\r\nand knowledge is no better than the\nrecollection\nof a dream.\n\nJust as the a=\r\nccession of treasure in a dream is useless, so also is\nsecond-hand knowledg=\r\ne.\n\nThe whole world is manifested in it like a city in a mirror. Such is th=\r\nat\ntranscendental state. On realising it, one becomes immortal; there is no=\r\n\nplace for doubts and uncertainties, as there is none at the sight of a\nref=\r\nlection in a mirror; there is no more reason for ignorance as at the\nsight =\r\nof innumerable reflected images; and there will be no more room for\ndesire,=\r\n because transcendence is then experienced.\n\nJust as a prince labours under=\r\n a misapprehension that the string of pearls\nstill clinging to his neck has=\r\n been stolen away by another and is not\npersuaded to the contrary by mere w=\r\nords but only believes when he finds it\naround his neck by his own effort, =\r\nso also, O youth, however clever a man\nmay be, he will never know his own s=\r\nelf by the mere teaching of others\nunless he realises it for himself. Other=\r\nwise he can never realise the Self\nif his mind is turned outward.\n\n\nEverybo=\r\ndy fails in this investigation however learned and proficient he may\nbe, be=\r\ncause his mind is not bent inward but restlessly moves outward. As\nlong as =\r\nthoughts crop up, so long has the turning inward of the mind not\nbeen accom=\r\nplished. As long as the mind is not inward, so long the Self\ncannot be real=\r\nised. Turning inward means absence of desire. How can the mind\nbe fixed wit=\r\nhin if desires are not given up?\n\nYou are not the body, nor the senses, nor=\r\n the mind, because they are all\ntransient. The body is composed of food, so=\r\n how can you be the body?\n\nConcentration on a particular item is necessary =\r\nfor the perception of\nexternal things. But since consciousness is the Self =\r\nand not apart from the\nmind, concentration on it is not necessary for its r=\r\nealisation.It is enough\nthat other perceptions (namely,thoughts) should be =\r\neliminated from the mind\nand then the Self will be realised.\n\nTherefore it =\r\nwas also said that the sole necessity for Self-realisation is\npurity of min=\r\nd. The only impurity of the mind is thought. To make it\nthought-free is to =\r\nkeep it pure.\n\nThe mind is truly abstracted in sleep. But then its light is=\r\n screened by\ndarkness, so how can it manifest its true nature? A mirror cov=\r\nered with tar\ndoes not reflect\nimages, but can it reflect space also? Is it=\r\n enough, in that case, that\nimages are eliminated in order to reveal the sp=\r\nace reflected in the mirror?\nIn the same manner, the mind is veiled by the =\r\ndarkness of sleep and rendered\nunfit for illumining thoughts. Would such ec=\r\nlipse of the mind reveal the\nglimmer of consciousness?\n\nMoreover, pursue th=\r\ne analogy of a tarred mirror. The tar may prevent the\nimages from being see=\r\nn, but the quality of the mirror is not affected, for\nthe outer coating of =\r\ntar must be reflected in the interior of the mirror. So\nalso the mind, thou=\r\ngh diverted from dreams and wakefulness, is still in the\ngrip of dark sleep=\r\n and not free from qualities.This is evident by the\nrecollection of the dar=\r\nk ignorance of sleep when one wakes.\n\nSri Sankara has said in Soundarya Lah=\r\nari: Siva owes his prowess to Sakti; He\ncannot even stir in Her absence.Siv=\r\na should not therefore be considered to\nbe a mere inexpressible entity depe=\r\nnding for His movements upon Maya (like a\nman on his car). Sri Sankara cont=\r\ninues: Siva is yoked by Thee, Oh Sakti, to\nHis true being. Therefore a bles=\r\nsed few worship Thee as the endless series\nof waves of bliss, as the underl=\r\nying basis of all that is, as the Supreme\nForce, maintaining the universe, =\r\nand as the Consort of Transcendence. Thus\nthe identity of Siva and Sakti wi=\r\nth each other or with Transcendence is\nevident.\n\nWhen the pictures on a wal=\r\nl are erased, the original wall remains. No other\nwork is necessary to rest=\r\nore its original condition.\n\nSimilarly, the mind remains pure when thoughts=\r\n are eliminated.Therefore the\nunqualified state is restored if the present =\r\ndisturbance is ended.\n\nTherefore rule out creation as a mere thought or ser=\r\nies of thoughts and\nrealise the non-dual, residual, pure intelligence as th=\r\ne Self.\n\nSecond-hand knowledge of the Self gathered from books or Gurus can=\r\n never\nemancipate a man until its truth is rightly investigated and applied=\r\n to\nhimself; direct Realisation alone will do that. Therefore, follow my ad=\r\nvice\nand realise yourself, turning the mind inward.\n\nTo imagine that the Se=\r\nlf is shackled by mental projections is to imagine\nthat the fire reflected =\r\nin a mirror can burn it. There is absolutely no\nbondage beyond the foolish =\r\ncertainty that you are bound and the difference\nof entity created by mind. =\r\nUntil these two blemishes are washed away by the\nholy waters of investigati=\r\non into the Self, neither I, nor Brahma the\nCreator, nor Vishnu, nor Siva, =\r\nnor even Sri Tripura, the Goddess of Wisdom,\ncan help that person to be ema=\r\nncipated.\n\nSource: TRIPURA RAHASYA OR THE MYSTERY BEYOND THE TRINITY Transl=\r\nated by\nSWAMI SRI RAMANANANDA SARASWATHI (Munagala S.
