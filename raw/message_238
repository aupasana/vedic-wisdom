One must take exercise regularly. I suggest the following exercises will help one gain height: \n  (i) Stand in an open space in �attention� position. In hale deeply through the nose and extend yours arms lifting then slowly up to your shoulders. Keep your arms straight. Hold that position for some time and then take the arms backwards as far as they will go. No inhale again the release your breath slowly, resuming the former position. \n(ii) Stand with your arms straight at right angles to your body. Lift the arms vertically and then bring them to the level of the shoulders. Do not exhale in the process, but stand on your toes, lifting your heels as far as they will go. Exhale slowly after some moments and resume the earlier position. \n(iii) Extend your arms forward up to the level of the shoulders. Inhale and fill your lungs to about one-third of their capacity. Wait for a few moments and then take your arms above your head. Now move them in a circular motion-taking them behind your back and in the former position again. Exhale slowly. \n How can one increase weight? \nTake to a diet for three to four days. Take 100 to 150 grams of bran with the fruits. The best way will be to mix bran with a fruit like papaya. It will increase appetite, improve the digestion and remove costiveness, if any. One will tend to eat more and the capacity to assimilate food will be increased. \n Foods like flour, rice honey, raisins, figs, dates, butter, and etc. can help increase weight. Sweat substances can increase weight than fatty foods. Those wishing to increase their weight should become pure vegetarians and eat fruits, rice, flour, fresh vegetables, bananas, dry fruits, butter, and milk. Germinated wheat is also extremely beneficial if taken in the form of gruel mixed with hot milk. \n  Take plenty of water, exercise and fast once a week\n\n       \n---------------------------------\n Share files, take polls, and discuss your passions - all under one roof.
