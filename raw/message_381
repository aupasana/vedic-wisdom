There are other technicalities that can be done away with, when they start to block one.\n \n*        *        *\n \nI recently saw the chart of a person, who I am sure will make much progress and be in a position to guide thousands of people spiritually. His chart strongly suggested that he should chant Chandipath or do Chandi homam and then progress will come. I told him that. He said he learnt Chandipath sometime ago but he does not read it regularly because he does not have the anga nyasam and kara nyasam text. He cannot read Indian scripts and can only read English. Chandipath is available in Roman script from Ramakrishna math, but that only has the thirteen chapters, kavacham, argala and keelakam. It does not give the nyasas, which are given in the Gita press version (available only in Indian languages). The poor guy assumed he could not do it without proper nyasas and did not attempt to do it.\n \nI told him that 13 chapters are the main thing and all else is secondary. I told him to just start with 13 chapters.\n \n*        *        *\n \nLike this, many people have various ideas about &quot;the right way&quot; to do it and do not even try things lest they should it do it &quot;a wrong way&quot;!\n \nOf course, there *are* right ways to do poojas, japas and homas. However, there are also right ways to do so many things. Let me give an analogy using eating.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThere are right ways to eat too. There are certain mantras you should say before eating, while eating and after eating. There are rules for what items should be eaten. There are  rules for what order they should be served in, on the plate. There are rules for how the served items are arranged on the plate. There are rules for what order you eat them in. There are rules for what kind of plate can be used (silver, gloden, copper, banana leaf etc). There are rules for what kind of clothese the person serving food can wear. There are rules for what kind of clothes eater can wear. There are many many rules.\n \nSuppose you don&#39;t know some rules. Or suppose you are unable to follow some rules and have to compromise. Or suppose you don&#39;t know the mantras to be recited before and after eating. Will you then stop eating? Won&#39;t it be foolish to not eat because you cannot follow all the rules and technicalities of eating? Won&#39;t you compromise wherever you have to and just eat *some* food, so that you get some strength and sustain yourself?\n \nFriends, the *same* thing applies to spiritual sadhana. Whether you spend 5 hours or 1 hour or half hour or ten minutes everyday on spiritual sadhana, it should be an integral part of your life. It should be as important as eating food, drinking water and breathing air. In fact, it really is. Just as not eating makes you weak, not doing any sadhana also makes you weak. Just as eating makes you stronger, doing some sadhana also makes you stronger.\n \nPeople are unnecessarily afraid of spiritual sadhana. They take all the rules and technicalities too seriously (unlike with other things in life, such as eating, drinking, bathing etc) and block themselves from progressing.\n \nThis needs to change. People need to know that it is ok to compromise on most things, but important to do *some* sadhana. Just as you would eat simple dal chaval (lentil soup with rice) or a bread and cheese sandwich when there is no multi-course meal that satisfies the rules, you can just sit down for 15 minutes without moving and repeat any mantra. Or just light a fire in a silver or copper or clay bowl with sticks, say &quot;Om bhuh swaha, Om bhuvah swaha, Om suvah swaha, Om bhurbhuvassuvah swaha&quot; and then repeat some mantra with swaha added and some ghee drops poured into fire. Such a simple sadhana also, when repeated daily, can be powerful. It is definitely better than avoiding sadhana at all, just as eating just a bread sandwich is better than not eating at all.\n \n*        *        *\n \nRules and technicalities are there to maximize the experience one gets from sadhana. They are NOT there to block or stop one from doing sadhana altogether. That would be counter productive.\n \nEach rule, each technicality and each step in the standard procedures has some deeper meaning and motive (which is lost on people these days!), but it is ok to compromise. If you can, follow *all* the rules. If you cannot, atleast do *something* with several rules compromised, rather than not doing anything at all.\n \nToo many people are suffering from intertia when it comes to progressing spiritually. I see some great souls meant for big things also suffering from inertia at various levels. Unnecessary fear of rules and technicalities is part of the reason for this inertia.\n \nThis needs to be changed. Spiritually inclined people have to be empowered and boldened. The fear and inertia in them need to be destroyed. This is very much needed for not just for the individual good of those people, but the collective good of world in these interesting times.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
