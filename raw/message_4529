I am practising detachment from money. During this pr=\r\nocess I have frequently observed anything I speak about money she gets hurt=\r\n as I immediately see some financial loss. If one says I don&#39;t want money i=\r\nt is like offending the Goddess and when one says I want money it becomes d=\r\nesire. So how to detach mind from money the right way? I am spiritually con=\r\nnected to that Goddess and have seen her visions almost all my life and don=\r\n&#39;t wish to hurt her in anyway. I am also sorry if my question sounds silly =\r\nbut whatever I am today is only because of your teachings. I don&#39;t have muc=\r\nh spiritual knowledge and neither do I get time to read books. I rely compl=\r\netely on your teachings and any words of wisdom coming from you would be of=\r\n great help. Kindly guide,\n\nThanks and Best regards,\nPriya\n\n\n"}}
