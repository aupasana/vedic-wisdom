The stronger the mind becomes, the better. Mind has also been co=\r\nmpared to  a restive horse. Such  a horse  generally takes  the  rider  alo=\r\nng  the  wrong path.Only he who can hold a tight rein and check the horse c=\r\nan go the right way.Struggle, struggle on! What are you doing?Is everything=\r\n achieved by the mere wearing of the Gerua cloth(ochre-coloured cloth of th=\r\ne Sannyasin) or by renunciation of hearth and home?  What have you realised=\r\n? Time is flying.Do not waste a single  moment.You will be able to work har=\r\nd only another three or four years at the most.Afterwards both body and min=\r\nd will become weak and infirm and you will not be able to do anything.What =\r\ncan be achieved without diligence? \n\n\n\n"}}
