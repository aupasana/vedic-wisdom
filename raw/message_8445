But in my mind, Durga, Lakshmi, H=\r\nari and Hara are all One, so I feel I worship them all when I say the mantr=\r\na Om Namo Narayanaya (for that matter, I feel I worship Allah, Buddha and J=\r\nehovah too when I repeat this mantra). I feel all these exist in Narayana. =\r\nWhile I love the forms of Hari and Durga especially, and find them the easi=\r\nest to talk to, I also find the forms of Radha and Shiva enchantingly beaut=\r\niful. The Hare Krishnas say that Krishna can only be attained through the G=\r\nrace of Radha. Many saints have said in the past that the mother is always =\r\neasily accessible, always close to her children, keeping an eye on them and=\r\n they can speak with her freely.....the father tends to be a bit more dista=\r\nnt....and only the Mother can introduce a child to it&#39;s Father! This idea s=\r\nort of appeals to my mind. So I pester/worship Durga to attain both Hari an=\r\nd Her too (they are One of course). And also, to attain the formless God th=\r\nat is beyond them both. I feel it is She who keeps me on the path, and keep=\r\ns my sadhana going. Without her, there&#39;s no doubt, that all would be lost. =\r\n\n\nDubeyji,\n\nThanks for the links....I found the articles very interesting. =\r\nNot quite sure what to make of the one on sleep paralysis, but all I can sa=\r\ny is, I will certainly keep up the chanting before bedtime! \n\nBest wishes,\n=\r\n\nAparna\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishriha=\r\nri@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0It was nice to see =A0your letter and r=\r\nead about your experience. There is no need to feel embarrassment as a grea=\r\nt deal of people feel unhappy talking about ghost/spirit although they migh=\r\nt say otherwise. And what you experienced was very frightening at such a yo=\r\nung age but it will prove positive for you in future. One day soon or later=\r\n you will become a teacher yourself and give Diksha to others and if somebo=\r\ndy asks your help in such a situation you will draw on your experience and =\r\nnot on some bookish knowledge.\n&gt; \n&gt; =A0I have to say that I have experience=\r\nd a great deal of such similar disturbing incident . Each and every time I =\r\nhave been saved by Grace of Divine mother. I will woke up shouting and reci=\r\nting Divine names. Sometimes I would know what might be the cause of such a=\r\n attack. I never dismiss such incidents as just my imagination=A0and try to=\r\n take proper action by going over the things I have done previous day. I am=\r\n also able to see very easily spirits/beings etc and some years back I used=\r\n to give deep healing to certain persons whom I had never met so they might=\r\n go to higher dimensions and become free from cycle. And I always ask Divin=\r\ne Mother&#39;s permission for it. Last year in Oct. ancestors of very famous fa=\r\nmily in England suddenly appeared in my front room where I was doing my eve=\r\nryday japa and indicated they need similar sort of healing. They were a cou=\r\nple who were very famous when they were alive. I became very nervous and go=\r\nt up and avoided touching them\n&gt;  and went to my Puja Room to ask for guida=\r\nnce. Divine Mother immediately refused any healing for them through me. The=\r\ny have sort of disappeared since then.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am puzzled by something you s=\r\naid.You will pester -Her- for help. Help for What?? They are Sister And Bro=\r\nther and in fact They are One and Same. This world is creation of Divine Mo=\r\nther. She is in it and also far away from it.And when She is meshed up with=\r\n Her devotees She feels joy and pain as well. And if you will pray and wors=\r\nhip Her for this reason She might not say anything but some heart string wi=\r\nll not play right. And Her Big Brother will also look at Her. I would hold =\r\nHer Feet for Her sake and do the likewise for Divine Lord.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I was =\r\nliving in Brijbhoomi, it was the ashram of disciples of Swami Shivanand =A0=\r\nwhere I have rented a room. When I came back to London I kept receiving pam=\r\nphlets from the Sivanand Yoga centre for several years. I never attended an=\r\ny workshop there but I used to cut out the pictures and names of Divine Mot=\r\nher and keep them in my books.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; LaxmiNarayan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt;  From: sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@=\r\n...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Sent: Thursday, 28 June 2012, 19=\r\n:09\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mahamrityunjaya and Divine Namapathy\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hello LaxmiNarayanji,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the encouraging message. The =\r\nthought of Vishnu turning on his watery resting place and glancing in this =\r\ndirection is rather sweet. You&#39;ve motivated me to do the mantra with even m=\r\nore enthusiasm now. Thank you. :) I will pester Her for help with this.....=\r\n.Ramakrishna says you have to keep tugging at Her sari till she gives you s=\r\nomething vaguely worthwhile like devotion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Very interesting to hear of=\r\n your experience in Delhi. I agree that the Name provides protection agains=\r\nt dodgy situations. I don&#39;t like to think about ghosts/spirits etc.... I&#39;m =\r\nembarrassed to say that have always been scared of the dark since childhood=\r\n, slowly getting over it now. \n&gt; \n&gt; Once at university, around 7 years ago,=\r\n I was preparing for some exams. It was after term-time and I had stayed ba=\r\nck to revise.=A0 I was moved to a room that was different to the one I had =\r\nbeen staying in, as my usual room was being used for some conference guests=\r\n. I used to hang out with the Hare Krishnas then, and was really into chant=\r\ning the Hare Rama mahamantra then (still love this mantra, but chant Om Nam=\r\noNarayanaya more now)- used to do 2 hours a day and it made me feel good. \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; I was lying on my back in this new room trying to sleep around 11 pm, =\r\nand was in some sort of light sleep state. At that point I had a very nasty=\r\n sensation that can only be described as something or someone trying really=\r\n hard to strangle me! I felt very frightened, and couldn&#39;t move, speak or w=\r\nake myself up.\n&gt; \n&gt; In this state, my mind started repeating &quot;Hari, Hari, H=\r\nari,Hari, Hari&quot; very very fast in terror. I think I chose this name because=\r\n it was short and I could say it very fast with concentration! The frighten=\r\ning experience then passed and I felt the Name saved me.\n&gt; \n&gt; I woke up and=\r\n turned on the light feeling absolutely petrified and unable to go back to =\r\nsleep. I then did something I wouldn&#39;t normally do. I rang the Sivananda Yo=\r\nga centre in London at that time of night (I knew they don&#39;t sleep till abo=\r\nut midnight as I&#39;ve stayed there) and had the nerve to ask to speak with a =\r\nsenior lady Swami who initiated me into my chosen mantra. Despite the late =\r\nhour of 11 pm, she very kindly came to the phone and reassured me saying it=\r\n could have been some real negative force or just something from my imagina=\r\ntion. Either way, she reassured me saying I had done nothing wrong to cause=\r\n it, and repeating the Name was the right approach. She suggested chanting =\r\nbefore bedtime to avoid similar experiences. I then chanted some rounds of =\r\nthe Mahamantra before going to bed and slept fine (had to sleep with the li=\r\nght though on because I&#39;m a coward ;).\n&gt; \n&gt; Since then, I keep up the pract=\r\nice of repeating the Name before bedtime. I feel it keeps the err...nasties=\r\n..away! And brings positive Divine energy to my mind ensuring better sleep.=\r\n :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Best wishes,\n&gt; \n&gt; Aparna\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; =A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0Hello,\n&gt; &gt; =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 =A0 Thanks for writing this mail and the=A0link to to the a=\r\nrticle.=A0.=A0\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; This is a very powerful and sacred mantra and I =\r\nam sure regular japa=A0brings peace and protection.

It is weird to see how the body loses=\r\n all importance the moment it dies. It is also strange how a dead body look=\r\ns just like an empty house...exactly like someone just left. It certainly m=\r\nakes one think that there must be something more to us than this fleshy cag=\r\ne. This cage that becomes unattractive in old age, filled with appalling mi=\r\nseries in serious illness, and hideous in death. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is interestin=\r\ng to think about what one can do to help the sick and dying, when they reac=\r\nh a stage beyond all human aid. It is not pleasant to watch someone die whi=\r\nle feeling utterly helpless to relieve suffering. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sivananda used =\r\nto have great faith in the Name- he used to call it &quot;Divine Namapathy&quot;. Whi=\r\nle modern medicine, Ayurveda, Reiki etc all have their place, he used to sa=\r\ny that, Namapathy was an outstanding way to prevent disease and heal us on =\r\nall levels- physical, mental and spiritual. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; While he said all nam=\r\nes of God- Rama, Allah, Buddha, Jehovah- are equal, he often mentioned the =\r\nMahamrityunjaya mantra specially for healing purposes. And especially for t=\r\nhose who are very sick or dying.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He says &quot;MahaMrityunjaya Mantra w=\r\nill remove accidents, incurable diseases and bestow long life and immortali=\r\nty. It is a Moksha Mantra too.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I visited the Sivananda Charitable=\r\n hospital in Pattamadai, Tamil Nadu some years ago, and the doctors and nur=\r\nses who work there, start the day with chanting of mantras (including the M=\r\nahamrityunjaya) for their patients, each other and the whole world. I belie=\r\nve it is the same with the little Ashram hospital in Rishikesh. What a wond=\r\nerful way to start the day.....repeating mantras with your colleagues. \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; I wanted to mention the power of this mantra for anyone who knows peo=\r\nple who are sick/seriously ill (or indeed, if you yourself are unfortunatel=\r\ny unwell). It is simply to invoke the blessing of God to ease suffering, or=\r\n to help bear suffering better. Basically saying &quot;Thy Will be done&quot; because=\r\n You know what is best. Of course it is NOT asking for a miracle cure (unle=\r\nss that happens to be the Will of God). \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; At any point in time, the=\r\nre are several human beings, animals and various creatures who are dying, a=\r\nnd unfortunately suffering greatly during the process of dying. I think it =\r\nwould be nice to repeat this mantra a few times daily to reduce their miser=\r\ny. Our sages say it works, and I believe them. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Here is a link for=\r\n those who are interested in learning more about this great mantra. The art=\r\nicle is written by a disciple of Swami Satyananda, a saint of very recent t=\r\nimes. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://www.yogamag.net/archives/2007/ajan07/mrit.shtml\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Best wishes,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Aparna\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =A0 \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; || Om ShaantihSha=\r\nantihShaantih ||\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
