Not being able t=\r\no perform this wonderful homam everyday, I am not able to get the mantras b=\r\nyheart and always have to keep referencing the manual as I do homam, which =\r\nis kind of inconvenient. I thought of solution to get around this. I want t=\r\no take up a mandala deeksha of doing the homam everyday for 41 days (hopefu=\r\nlly get it byheart by the end of it), culminating in Vinayaka Chaturthi tha=\r\nt falls on September 11th, Saturday, this year. Is my calculation right? I =\r\nhave Jagannatha Hora software to determine what date is Bhadrapada Shukla C=\r\nhaturthi in Michigan, USA. Is my approach right? \n\n2. The purpose of doing =\r\nthis homam is for myself to have more clarity on spiritual matters (and not=\r\nhing else). From time to time I keep getting into several internal debates =\r\nin my mind as to what is right / wrong even when I am interpreting great bo=\r\noks like Srimadbhagavadgita. In the recent past I am trying to involve myse=\r\nlf in an intense study of this great scripture and keep getting all kinds o=\r\nf Dharma Sandehas (just like Arjuna did) and I think the only way one will =\r\nhave the kind of understanding that Arjuna had at the end of it, is only af=\r\nter having a full darshana of the lord (in whichever life it happens). So, =\r\nin my opinion, only Sadhana can lead to some real answers for the questions=\r\n we keep getting from time to time as we read these confusing scriptures. A=\r\nm I thinking in the right direction?\n\nRegards, \n\nNagraj \n\n--- In \nvedic-wis=\r\ndom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\nYes, this is a reasonable substitute for Satya Narayana vratam. If you want=\r\n, you could add aahutis for loka palakas also (OM gaNapataye swaahaa, OM br=\r\nahmaNe swaahaa, OM lakShmyai swaahaa, OM viShNave swaahaa, OM rudraaya swaa=\r\nhaa, OM gauryai swaahaa).\n&gt;  \n&gt; Manish specifically mentioned to me that Ga=\r\nnapathi homam, Chandi homam and Vishnu sahasra naama homam are very importa=\r\nnt in this age and we need several people doing them regularly. Ganapathi h=\r\nomam and Chandi homam seem to have caught on and a critical mass of people =\r\nare already doing them. This will only increase with time. I hope Vishnu sa=\r\nhasra naama homam also catches on. Many people know how to chant Vishnu sah=\r\nasra naama stotra and doing a homam with it adds only 10 minutes to the cha=\r\nnting time! Of course, if one wants to make it longer, one can repeat a few=\r\n times.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Vishnu&#39;s 1000 name prayer is very powerful and charges one wi=\r\nth saattwik energy, a sense of dharma and purpose in life.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regar=\r\nds,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writing=\r\ns,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;  =\r\n                 http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      Films that make a di=\r\nfference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/JyotishWritings\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- &quot;nagraj@...&quot; &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Hi Everyon=\r\ne, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am really happy to inform you all that we performed Sri Vish=\r\nnu Homam at my Friend&#39;s place recently. One of my friends bought a house re=\r\ncently and wanted me to perform Ganapathi Homam and Sudarsana Homam. But si=\r\nnce I did not know how to do a Sudarsana homam and more over I was not incl=\r\nined to get details on Sudarsana homam since it was discussed by Shri Naras=\r\nimha here before as a homam for a weapon, I prefered to do a more satvik ho=\r\nmam like VishnuHomam and suggested the same. They agreed and we first did a=\r\n Ganapathi Homam and then proceeded to do a Vishnu Homam after a short brea=\r\nk. Indeed it was a great experience that while reciting Vishnu Sahasranamam=\r\n and offering Ahutis, the fire has risen really nicely (almost upto a foot =\r\nand half in height with just three dry coconut-halves and it was a wonderfu=\r\nl sight). This is very similar to Satyanarayana vratam that we offer ahutis=\r\n to navagrahas, do the regular dikpalaka pooja etc. Except for the &#39;Pancha =\r\nLoka Palaka Pooja&#39; and the five stories after the vratam, I find that in Vi=\r\nshnu homam, all the essentials are still covered. I find that this Homam is=\r\n a good substitute (and takes lesser time) than Satyanarayana Vratam, if on=\r\ne is falling short of time! Am I right, Sri Narasimha?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
