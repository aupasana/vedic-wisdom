That is why you find a meat-eater\nreborn either as a=\r\n predator or prey or as both in succession. Human\nbeings cry a lot at funer=\r\nals of their own kind but they have absolutely\nno thought for the suffering=\r\ns of the animals they slaughter. They never\nhesitate to kill and eat. Just =\r\nthink, first they kill the chicken. Often\nthey will cut its throat and let =\r\nit bleed to death, which is a most\npainful way to die. Then it will be clea=\r\nned, cooked and eaten, and if it\nhappens to be tough everyone will curse it=\r\n for not satisfying their\npalates. How many humans would give beautiful ten=\r\nder lean meat if they\nwere slaughtered, dressed, prepared and served?\n\nMeat=\r\n-eaters conveniently forget that animal mothers too love their\nchildren. Do=\r\n they ever think of the agony a hen goes through when her\nchicks are slain =\r\nin front of her eyes? or a cow, the embodiment of\nmotherliness, do they con=\r\nsider how much she suffers when she sees the\nslaughter of her beloved calf =\r\nwhom she has grown in her own body and\nnourished with her milk, whom she lo=\r\nves more than her own life?\nDo these so called humans ever think of the ter=\r\nrible pain they cause to\nmother cow? Could they endure their own children b=\r\neing murdered before\ntheir own eyes?\n\nHow is Ma to teach such donkeys? They=\r\n are not humans, whose intellect is\nsubtle enough to self-identify with ano=\r\nther being of a different species\nand experience its personal joys and sorr=\r\nows. Ma has no alternative but\nto make them suffer, allowing the animals th=\r\ney have tortured to torture\nthem in return. Fair&#39;s fair, after all. If I cu=\r\nt your throat in this\nbirth you have every right to cut mine in the next or=\r\n some succeeding\nbirth.
