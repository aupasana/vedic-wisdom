When you are writing in a public forum, y=\r\nou are spending your time in doing so willingly, and there are no rights. A=\r\nlso, in a public debate, there is concept of debate getting over for a part=\r\nicular individual.\n\nDiscussion in a group is not like a private chat room. =\r\nIf you have spent time writing it, other are spending time reading to it.\n\n=\r\nIf you see some thing objectionable in what Narasimha writes, you can count=\r\ner it. But, I do not feel it is correct to says Narasimha, or so and so per=\r\nsons are not allowed in my discussion thread is appropriate as far as Yahoo=\r\n group policies are concerned.\n\n&gt; 4.=A0 =A0 If you are left with even a lit=\r\ntle respect for the\n&gt; individuality of another person, please ensure that y=\r\nou don&#39;t send\n&gt; unsolicited intercepting mails particularly when your name =\r\nhas not been mentioned inside the mail.\n\nVijay: Again, email groups are not=\r\n one to one communication. If my name is not mentioned, but, by reading it =\r\nI feel I have a point to share, I always have the liberty to step in write =\r\nmy two cents. If what I am writing is completely irrelavent, then you can b=\r\ne upset. But, the other person may have felt what he wrote to be relavent a=\r\nnd may not have intended to disrespect you.\n\n&gt; 8.=A0 =A0 If you don&#39;t give =\r\nspace to members, then, as a moderator,\n&gt; you won&#39;t ever be able to achieve=\r\n the &quot;state of discipline and\n&gt; decorum&quot; and &quot;participation of group member=\r\ns&quot; at the same time.\nVijay: As far I have seen over the last 6 months, memb=\r\ners absolutely have the freedome to disagree and debate and question Narasi=\r\nmha (you may want to recall the thread about types of Agni as an example). =\r\nI had liked the thread so far.
