The instructions and explanations continue to be=\r\n in English, but the mantras are written in these languages for ease of rea=\r\nding.\n&gt;  \n&gt; We have also made available a quick reference guide (or &quot;cheat =\r\nsheet&quot;) containing only mantras and no instructions. If you already read th=\r\ne manual and feel comfortable with the procedure and only want a printout o=\r\nf mantras to refer to, you can download it and use it. It is also available=\r\n for Mahaganapathi homam and Shiva homam in Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, San=\r\nskrit and English scripts.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Just go to the homam website below and go =\r\nto Mahaganapathi homam or Shiva homam link to download these additions.\n&gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; Other homam manuals will also be available in this format soon. Ravi and=\r\n Kishore are slowly working on one manual after another.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Baraha softw=\r\nare from baraha.com was used for Indian languages (big thanks to them!). Th=\r\ney have Vedic swaras available only in Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam. If yo=\r\nu want the manual in any other Indian language, please send a nice note req=\r\nuesting the friendly developers of baraha o add support for vedic swaras in=\r\n that language. As they add this support in other languages, we will create=\r\n more homam manuals.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In the long run, I want manuals to be fully tran=\r\nslated to various Indian languages, i.e. instructions and explanations also=\r\n in Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam etc. But that may take a long time.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Be=\r\nst regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.o=\r\nrg/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpa=\r\nna\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotis=\r\nh lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software=\r\n (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) web=\r\nsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ---------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
