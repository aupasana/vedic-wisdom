I see that\n&gt; your signature chang=\r\ned after the trip.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; We had a remarkable time at Varanasi.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Th=\r\ne moment our flight landed at the Kashi airport which is actually quite\n&gt; o=\r\nutside the main city of Kashi, Manish said there is something in here which=\r\n\n&gt; is different. The energy is palpable throughout. After checking in at th=\r\ne\n&gt; hotel we spend the time in roaming around the ghats, watching the eveni=\r\nng\n&gt; Ganga Arati and shooting.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; By 9 PM Manish decided on doing a Ch=\r\nandi homa, at the famous Manikarnika\n&gt; samshan, on a funeral pyre. Sadhana =\r\nin a samshan bhoomi is something that\n&gt; many great sadhakas in Hinduism hav=\r\ne done before. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa\n&gt; used to perform various sadhanas i=\r\nn a samshan.Sri Trilanga Swami - a great\n&gt; siddha - spent most of his days =\r\nnear the Manikarnik Samshan doing\n&gt; sadhana. The effect that a Samshan has =\r\non the human consciousness can be\n&gt; apty used, for those who have such incl=\r\nination, to further ones spiritual\n&gt; growth. The fire of a funeral pyre is =\r\ncalled kravyada agni, an impure form\n&gt; of fire unlike the fire of a standar=\r\nd homa agni. However, there have been\n&gt; sadhakas, and many in number, who h=\r\nas used the samshan agni to perform\n&gt; homas. They chose not to make a disti=\r\nnction between pure and impure.If\n&gt; someone feels that a funeral pyre is &quot;u=\r\nnholy&quot;, he or she would be better off\n&gt; not trying anything in such a fire.=\r\n The main deities of a samshan bhoomi are\n&gt; Mahakala and\n&gt; &gt; Mahakali.\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;  We went to buy some samagri - til (black and white), couple of full\n&gt; =\r\ncoconuts, flowers, incense stick (agabatti),  kismis, havan samagri. While\n=\r\n&gt; buying the samagri from a shop inside a lane near the Vishwanath temple,\n=\r\n&gt; suddenly a small begger child came and kept asking for food. There was a\n=\r\n&gt; sweet shop on the other side of the lane, he pointed to the shop asking f=\r\nor\n&gt; food. Manish turned around, bought some food and gave it to the child.=\r\n The\n&gt; child was eating when we turned back towards the shop from where we =\r\nwere\n&gt; buying the samagri. In a moment Manish asked me to check for the chi=\r\nld, I\n&gt; turned round and found no one there. I looked in the lane and there=\r\n was no\n&gt; child anywhere. Just gone, vanished! I still remember the child v=\r\nery\n&gt; clearly. Manish smiled and said, &quot; The deity of this place wanted to =\r\nsee\n&gt; whether we had become so big sadhakas that we are unable to feed a hu=\r\nngry\n&gt; child . That is how God comes to test people. Kya pata Narayan kab, =\r\nkaha\n&gt; aur kis\n&gt; &gt; roop me mil jaye.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At 11 pm we left for Manikarn=\r\nik, dressed in a combination of red and\n&gt; black. Walking along the ghats we=\r\n reached the samshan at around eleven\n&gt; thirty. It was quite crowded, with =\r\ndomes (people who work there to help the\n&gt; bodies burn) and the relatives. =\r\nThere were at least 8 to 10 pyres burning\n&gt; simultaneously. Right next to i=\r\nt was the Ganges, pitch black at night. We\n&gt; sat on a stairs, waiting for t=\r\nhe crowd to ease out a bit, not sure when that\n&gt; will happen, not sure how =\r\npeople are going to react. As we sat observing,\n&gt; the people too were obser=\r\nving us with a mix of curiosity and\n&gt; possible apprehension. Suddenly Manis=\r\nh closed his eyes and meditated some\n&gt; time, then remarked that this place =\r\nhas a tremendous energy. Something of\n&gt; almost infinite abilities resides i=\r\nn this samshan bhoomi. A deity. While\n&gt; sayingf so he turned behind to look=\r\n at something, I too turned. I could see\n&gt; nothing but blank space. But tha=\r\nt very instant the dogs in the samshan went\n&gt; running to\n&gt; &gt; that direction=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; After waiting like this for about an hour, we found a pyre where =\r\nthe\n&gt; relatives had left.The major portion had been burnt already, but ther=\r\ne was\n&gt; enough left to last for some time still. We went and sat next to it=\r\n. Manish\n&gt; started the homa. The offering was of til. I sat next to him doi=\r\nng the\n&gt; Chandi path, trying to be in sync with his recital. A part of my m=\r\nind was\n&gt; also trying to adjust itself to the ambience. There were quite a =\r\nfew people\n&gt; around watching what we were upto. But no one disturbed. The d=\r\nome had to\n&gt; come and take wood from the pyre to light other pyres. He did =\r\nit in the most\n&gt; cautious manner possible, taking pieces from the fringe of=\r\n the pyre. After\n&gt; some time Manish indicated to him not to take any more w=\r\nood. The dome nodded\n&gt; his head and did not disturb that pyre again.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Very soon, within half an hour I noticed that a pack of 4/5 dogs had come=\r\n\n&gt; and were sitting around the pyre on which the homa was being done. As I =\r\nread\n&gt; the Chandi I felt a great pressure on my head, from all sides. As if=\r\n a\n&gt; something was pressing hard on my skull, gripping it tight. The\n&gt; conc=\r\nentration become excellent. I soon forgot who was watching us or\n&gt; anything=\r\n else around me, except for the sound of the Chandi Path. Very nice\n&gt; medit=\r\nation happened. The mind felt like as if it was a piece of iron and\n&gt; there=\r\n was a huuuuge magnet nearby which just kept pulling the mind away to\n&gt; som=\r\ne distant place, far, far away from the reality I am normally accustomed\n&gt; =\r\nto. While the homa was on, suddenly one black dog from the pack which was\n&gt;=\r\n sitting nearby, sat up on two legs and kept starting at Manish. For I thin=\r\nk\n&gt; about 10 mins it kept staring with it&#39;s head pointed in an angular fash=\r\nion.\n&gt; Its eyes and mannerism gave a feeling as if it is not an animal but =\r\na human\n&gt; being\n&gt; &gt; watching. Just staring and observing every action. Mani=\r\nsh said Kala\n&gt; Bhairava had entered into the body of that dog.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The =\r\nhoma finished at around 3 AM. The meditations both at the end as well\n&gt; as =\r\nin between, were all excellent. The mind would just get pulled a few\n&gt; notc=\r\nhes above the ordinary with slightest bit of effort.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Simply being i=\r\nn a samshan and observing the human body burning up has a\n&gt; powerful effect=\r\n on the mind. In a nearby pyre we saw the femur bones of a\n&gt; female human b=\r\nody burning. Both the femurs were visible and spread apart. In\n&gt; an ordinar=\r\ny setting, this kind of a scene would mean a woman with &quot;legs\n&gt; spread apar=\r\nt&quot; which has a very sexual connotation. In Manikarnik, on that\n&gt; night, it =\r\nonly evoked a feeling of how eventually the body is merely a\n&gt; covering for=\r\n something far more real and powerful that resides inside. The\n&gt; skin, fles=\r\nh, bones etc will perish as they are ment to perish. Only Rama\n&gt; naam satya=\r\n hai.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Manish said if your intentions of going to a samshan bhoomi i=\r\ns merely to\n&gt; please God through sadhanas - i.e you are not planning someth=\r\ning negative\n&gt; nor desirous of petty mundane gains - there is very little c=\r\nhance that you\n&gt; will ever come to harm. Further, when you do a Chandi homa=\r\n, no ethereal\n&gt; beings will disturb you because no one wants to mess with s=\r\nomeone who is\n&gt; worshipping Chandi. It is not difficult, neither something =\r\nto be\n&gt; unnecessarily scared of. There are spirits etc for sure, but neithe=\r\nr will\n&gt; you bother them nor will they bother you.  Surrendering to the dei=\r\nty is very\n&gt; good attitude to have. And finally, the soul of the individual=\r\n on whose pyre\n&gt; the homa is being done, is taken by the Goddess and acquir=\r\nes a lot of punya.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thus ended my first experience of a Chandi homa =\r\non a burning pyre.That\n&gt; night was Krishna Saptami. The next two nights aga=\r\nin we did homas at\n&gt; Manikarnik.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ...=\r\nto be continued...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rama Naama Satya Hai..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The INTERNET =\r\nnow has a personality.

In an ordinary setting, this kind of a scene would mean a woman=\r\n with &quot;legs spread apart&quot; which has a very sexual connotation. In=\r\n Manikarnik, on that night, it only evoked a feeling of how eventually the =\r\nbody is merely a covering for something far more real and powerful that res=\r\nides inside. The skin, flesh, bones etc will perish as they are ment to per=\r\nish. Only Rama naam satya hai.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =A0&lt;br&gt;&gt; Manish said if your int=\r\nentions of going to a samshan bhoomi is merely to please God through sadhan=\r\nas=A0- i.e you are not planning something negative nor desirous of petty mu=\r\nndane gains - there is very little chance that you will ever come to harm. =\r\nFurther, when you do a Chandi homa, no ethereal beings will disturb you bec=\r\nause no one wants to mess with=A0someone who is worshipping Chandi. It is n=\r\not difficult, neither something to be unnecessarily scared of. There are sp=\r\nirits etc for sure, but neither will you bother them nor will they bother y=\r\nou. =A0Surrendering to the deity is very good=A0attitude to have. And final=\r\nly, the soul of the individual on whose pyre the homa is being done, is tak=\r\nen by the Goddess and acquires a lot of punya.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =A0&lt;br&gt;&gt; Thus en=\r\nded my first experience of a Chandi homa on a burning pyre.That night was K=\r\nrishna Saptami. The next two nights again we did homas at Manikarnik. &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; =A0&lt;br&gt;&gt; -Regards&lt;br&gt;&gt; =A0Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;&gt; =A0&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ...to be =\r\ncontinued...&lt;br&gt;&gt; =A0&lt;br&gt;&gt; Rama Naama Satya Hai..&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&gt; The INTERNET now has a personality.
