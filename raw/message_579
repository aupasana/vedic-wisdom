I wrote you the mail same day asking about it. and\n&gt; i got the mail from you accepting me as your disciple on 3rd of sept\n&gt; (Ganesh Chaturthi day).\n&gt;\n&gt; both the above dates falls in the Mangal period, which is in Mithun\n&gt; Rashi.\n&gt;\n&gt; *NOW The main connection is that in my Birth Rashi chart, I have\n&gt; Mithun Lagna having Mars and Guru is in Dhanu* the situation exactly\n&gt; found in yout TP&#39;08 chart as indicated above.\n&gt;\n&gt; Adding to the above,Your TP&#39;08 Rashi chart has Kanya Lagna & my\n&gt; TP&#39;08 chart has also Kanya Lagna.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2] Today just thought of seeing the same chart (your TP&#39;08) with 7\n&gt; or 8 CK scheme. Honest persuit to see how it shows up.\n&gt;\n&gt; settings done for 8 CK scheme - Mangal is Pik & Guru is BK hence no\n&gt; connection to Shishya. PK is Budha debiliated. period\n&gt;\n&gt; The chart has no planets on the same degree. so let&#39;s apply the rule\n&gt; of 7CK which has comeup as a fresh translation.\n&gt;\n&gt; Mangal becomes MK. if we apply the second rule that MK also acts as\n&gt; PK. then things are explained. in Mangal (PK) ATP Dasha you found, a\n&gt; Shishya who intrestingly has Mangal in Muthun Lagna.\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; No way i am making any judgment about *working in practise* for 7/8\n&gt; CK. what i tried is just to apply on the said chart and found\n&gt; working nicely. however it is a long way to confirm if it works\n&gt; practically or not.\n&gt;\n&gt; but one thing is for sure that TP works amazingly. this is the one\n&gt; tool which i love to use with good confidence.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is it not another confirmation about GURU, Shishya & Jyotish Shastra?\n&gt;\n&gt; Aadhyaatmically & Jyotishially yours,\n&gt;\n&gt; Utpal Pathak\n&gt;\n&gt; --- End forwarded message ---\n\n\n"}}
