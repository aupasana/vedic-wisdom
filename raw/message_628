This is an unbelievable experience that I\nhave =\r\nhad. I have not added anything from my own. I am writing exactly\nas was hap=\r\npened in my life. I am going back to the period of 1973/74.\nKindly read thi=\r\ns only when you are in religious mood.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I was working as telegrap=\r\nhist at Okha Port Post office near Dwarka.\nMy duty was from 7 am to 7 pm an=\r\nd I was getting late fee allowance for\nextra duty. There was a Telephone ex=\r\nchange just opposite to Post\noffice and due to same Dep=E2=80=99t; I had fr=\r\niendship with some Telephone\noperators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will c=\r\nall him as Mr. Patel)\nwas working as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 shri\nRamkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was al=\r\nways talking about\nshri Thakur. We came close day by day. There was a weekl=\r\ny gathering at\nhis home called SATSANGA. He was singing devotional songs cr=\r\neated by\nhim and was weeping while singing. He was reading Ramkrishna\nKatha=\r\nmrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending this weekly meeting\non Saturda=\r\ny evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of 30\nthen. We were used =\r\nto go to seashore daily at 7 pm after duty hours\nand were talking only abou=\r\nt Thakur.\n&gt; One day when we were at sea shore he suddenly told me--=E2=80=\r\n=9CRawalbhai,\nsome guest have come to my home and my wife is remembering me=\r\n. My son\nwill come in a few minutes to call me. I shall have to go now=E2=\r\n=80=9D. --\nAnd with my surprise his 8 years old son came to call him. \n&gt; At=\r\n one another incident he told me that there will be a plane crash\ntomorrow =\r\nand that also happened. I was very much impressed about him.\nHe could fores=\r\nee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus, he\ntold me not to go t=\r\nhrough bus, as bus tire will be punctured. Yet I\nwent to Bus station but bu=\r\ns did not come from Dwarka as was punctured\non the way. This was surprising=\r\n.\n&gt; This all incidents made me to believe that he had some super power\nand =\r\nthis was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was attracted to\nshri Thakur.=\r\n One day I thought, I should also be disciple of shri\nThakur and the day ca=\r\nme. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered myself\nto Thakur at Mr. Patel=E2=\r\n=80=99s house before Thakur picture. I prayed him\ndeeply from my heart to a=\r\nccept me as his follower and bestow his grace. \n&gt; Next day morning I had a =\r\ndiscussion with my wife at 6.10 morning\nwhile taking the tea. As my duty wa=\r\ns to start from 7 am I was waking\nup at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in =\r\nthe morning that I have\naccepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife =\r\nwas annoyed and she\nargued with me a lot. =EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CWhy s=\r\nhould you take such a hasty decision?\nRamkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee o=\r\nf Maa Kali at Calcutta. He was a\ngreat Saint but our Guru should be living =\r\none, who can guide us, give\nus Mantra etc. etc. Better you take Dixa from S=\r\nhri Ram Sharma Acharya\nsince you are doing Gayatri Mantra=E2=80=9D--.\n&gt; Her=\r\n arguments were right at her place as people in general not know\nmuch about=\r\n Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I have taken\nhasty decision. I =\r\nwas in the influence of Mr. Patel. --\n&gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel had t=\r\nold me that Thakur was telling\ntheir disciples to test him before accepting=\r\n him. I also decided to\ntest Thakur. I immediately told my wife that =EF=BF=\r\n=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CSee, Mr. Patel has\nnever come to our home. You have a=\r\nlso not seen him. He has never asked\nme where I am living. Suppose Mr. Pate=\r\nl is coming to our house within\n10 to 15 minutes, would you believe that my=\r\n selection for Thakur is\nperfect?=E2=80=9D--\n&gt; She laughed at me=EF=BF=BD=\r\n=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CHow it is possible? I don=E2=80=99t believe.=E2=80=9D--\n=\r\n&gt; I prayed Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediately to justify my\ndecision=\r\n and convince my wife. =E2=80=98I want to test your existence even\ntoday.=\r\n=E2=80=99\n&gt; To our great surprise, Mr. Patel was at my home at 06.30 in the=\r\n\nmorning with angry mood. What he told?\n&gt; =E2=80=98 How dare you test Thaku=\r\nr this way? Do you know what happened?\nYesterday was my night duty and I ha=\r\nd just come to my home at 05.30\nmornings today and tried to sleep for 1 or =\r\n2 hours. Suddenly Thakur\npulled my blanket and told me that-=E2=80=9C Go to=\r\n your friend=E2=80=99s house. He\nis waiting for you. He wants to test me. I=\r\n will show you his house=E2=80=9D\n&gt; I immediately rushed to your home. Thak=\r\nur was guiding me the way to\nyour house and pushing me too.
