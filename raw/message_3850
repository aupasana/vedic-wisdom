The manu=\r\nal, written by Swami Sivananda, is comprehensive and throws light on the to=\r\npic in a big way. It probably answers many or all of your questions.\n\nOne t=\r\nhing is for sure - Swami Vivekananda (In Rajayoga book), Sivananda (In the =\r\nManual mentioned above), Even unconventional Vimalanada (Aghora Part-2) agr=\r\nee, in no uncertain terms, that real spiritual progress requires complete a=\r\nbsent of Sex Idea and action.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yah=\r\noogroups.com, &quot;pvklnrao&quot; &lt;pvklnrao@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; There are some unanswere=\r\nd questions in my mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; The argument involving Virya is not satisfying=\r\n to me:\n&gt; 1. This explanation is explaining predominantly from a male point=\r\n of view\n&gt; 2. According the modern doctors, whether or not you do intention=\r\nally or not, the Virya does not stay. It gets secreted any way.\n&gt; 3. Why so=\r\n much focus or affinity for accumulation of energy? Yes, the common argumen=\r\nt is that we need to accumulate spiritual energy to burn our karma. But, wh=\r\ny burn the karma? In several threads, the only absolute way of burning karm=\r\na seem to be paying it up with out attachment. It is all in the mind. In or=\r\nder to realise this and condition our mind, do we really need energy. I tru=\r\nst, what we need is the resolve and persistant effort.\n&gt; 4. Is not the goal=\r\n is not to have a goal? We are advised not to anticipate/wish for an experi=\r\nance while doing sadhana. Once we manage to do sadhana with out any anticip=\r\nation, why all this focus on accumulating energy or even obtaining Moksha?\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; If the definition of Brahmacharya is to keep the mind in Brahman all t=\r\nhe time, then our actions do not result in any more karma because, your min=\r\nd is focusing on brahman and hence you do not identify yourself in your act=\r\nions. You do them because you had to do them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps, best way to get=\r\n this is not avoiding certain actions but, try developing ability to keep t=\r\nhinking about God while doing any/every thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; This reminds me a story=\r\n I read in my child hood.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once Narada gets to proud that he is the bes=\r\nt devotee as he keeps thinking of Narayana all the time. Vishnu disappoints=\r\n him by naming some wood cutter as his best devotee. This wood cutter utter=\r\ns the name of Vishnu only few times during the day. Narada protests and the=\r\nn Vishnu gives him a wessel full of milk and asks him to put it on his head=\r\n and walk around.\n&gt; \n&gt; If can&#39;t stop sex, try to chant God&#39;s name while you=\r\n are doing sex. If you can manage to decrease amount of joy you derise out =\r\nof sex, then you are on the correct path. Nigraha will come automatically i=\r\nf you stop enjoying it.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
