I want to clarify it.\n=A0\nThere are three s=\r\n-sounds in Sanskrita - sha, Sha and sa (using iTrans notation). They appear=\r\n in alphabet in that order. The middle one is written in Devanagari script =\r\nlike &quot;pa&quot; with a cross line through it.

Pronounce the=\r\nm in quick succession a few times - &quot;ka cha Ta ta pa&quot;. Note the point where=\r\n tongue touches the upper palate/surface of mouth when you say these. For &quot;=\r\nka&quot;, it will be way back in mouth, near the throat. For &quot;cha&quot;, it will move=\r\n towards the front, but still in the back. For &quot;Ta&quot;, it will move further t=\r\nowards the front and tongue will touch a little above teeth. For &quot;ta&quot;, tong=\r\nue will touch teeth. For &quot;pa&quot;, tongue will not touch anything, but lips wil=\r\nl touch each other.\n=A0\nSay &quot;ka cha Ta ta pa&quot; several times and notice the =\r\nprogression from the back of mouth to lips. Get a feel for the position of =\r\n&quot;cha Ta ta&quot;. Say &quot;cha Ta ta&quot; several times.\n=A0\nNow, the pronunciation of &quot;=\r\nsha Sha sa&quot; (sh as in shiva, shrI etc, Sh as in uShA, veSha etc, s as in sa=\r\ntya, sama) is very similar to that of &quot;cha Ta ta&quot;. In the latter 3 sounds, =\r\ntongue touches the upper palate of mouth at 3 places (for which you just go=\r\nt a feel). In the former 3 sounds, tongue comes close to touching in the sa=\r\nme 3 places, but does not actually touch. It comes close to touching and th=\r\nere is some gap.\n=A0\nWith this understanding, now practice saying &quot;cha sha&quot;=\r\n several times, &quot;Ta Sha&quot; several times and &quot;ta sa&quot; several times. You will =\r\nsee that each pair is pronounced at the same place.
