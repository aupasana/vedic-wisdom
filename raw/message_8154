For the last couple of =\r\nyears, I have witnessed a gradual yet strong inclination towards spirituali=\r\nty, religion, rituals, yoga, ayurveda and jyotish. I have been reading a lo=\r\nt about them, mostly via the internet, some readings more helpful than othe=\r\nrs, but each drawing me closer towards learning more and understanding bett=\r\ner. A lot of what I read here, in this yahoo-group, is one of the most luci=\r\nd explanation of spirituality, and the final goal of every saadhana, and th=\r\ne link between spirituality and rituals, yoga, ayurveda, and leading a simp=\r\nle and humble life.\n\nI have downloaded the book compiled from your writings=\r\n on spiritual matters and I am in the process of reading that as well, and =\r\nderive great happiness in reading it. I also visited your website and saw a=\r\n wealth of material for spiritually inclined people there. The manuals on d=\r\no-it-yourself homams are one of your outstanding contributions to society, =\r\nand shine brightly among the other gems of your contributions. I feel an in=\r\nclination towards performing homams on a daily/weekly basis. Before I start=\r\n this, I want to seek your guidance on the following:\n\n1. Do I need to prep=\r\nare myself in any way before I start the homam?- I will explain to you what=\r\n I mean here - since you have suggested that one start with MahaGanapathi h=\r\nomam, I shall start with it too. However, as I have been worshipping DeviMa=\r\n every morning and Hanumanji every evening, do I need to start worshipping =\r\nMahaGanapathi now for a few days during mornings and evenings and then afte=\r\nr a few days, start with the homam?\n\n2. Related to the first question, as I=\r\n have been worshipping DeviMa for quite sometime now, I see/visualize Her m=\r\nany times during the day (at work/home), so now when I start with the MahaG=\r\nanapathi homam with complete faith, devotion, and surrender to MahaGanapath=\r\ni, wouldn&#39;t there be a conflict in my mind, since I may still be visualizin=\r\ng DeviMa everywhere around me (due to mind&#39;s conditioning), while I am wors=\r\nhipping MahaGanapathi as the One who is the source, cradle and end of every=\r\nthing, and hence shoule be visualizing Him instead? This may be a hypotheti=\r\ncal situation, as I am talking about the future, however, may still be rele=\r\nvant, and so I seek your advice here.\n\n3. As I am householder, and we are e=\r\nxpecting our first child in the next few months, is it ok to perform a homa=\r\nm at home? It may sound jouvenile but I don&#39;t know any better, and would ra=\r\nther listen to wiser men. The reason I ask this is that while doing the hom=\r\nam, we chant various mantras/stotras, and they produce effects in the immed=\r\niate environment, specially in the presence of Agni, the Pavaka. Although, =\r\nthe goal of my saadhana is to decondition my mimd to move towards greater p=\r\nurity, humility and peace, and I have faith that a regular homam will enabl=\r\ne me to achieve that. However, for the sake of my wife and our child (insid=\r\ne her womb), I am prompted to ask this question. Please don&#39;t take it in an=\r\ny other way except as a genuine concern for my family (however silly it is)=\r\n\n\n4. Related to the above question, if it is fine for me to do the homam at=\r\n home, then can my pregnant wife also participate in it, if she wants to?\n\n=\r\n5. Should I wait for an auspicious day like an amavasya or an eclipse to st=\r\nart the homam, or is any day fine? Similarly, should I do the homam at a pa=\r\nrticular time every day or is any time fine? I do understand that doing the=\r\n homam/any saadhana at the same time everyday, whatever time one does it, i=\r\ns more beneficial than doing it at different times.\n\n6. Is it better to do =\r\nthe homam at home or can it be done elsewhere as well? The reason I ask thi=\r\ns is we are living in a rented accomodation and the smoke from the homam ma=\r\ny blacken the walls and the ceiling. However, in our residential/apartment =\r\ncomplex, there is a common area, which is open on two sides, where some com=\r\nmunity festivals are celebrated together, and if I get the permission, then=\r\n maybe I can do the homam there? Is there a strong reason/added benefit to =\r\ndoing the homam at home?\n\nNarasimhaji, I will be very grateful to you for y=\r\nour answers to the above questions.\n\nYou are rendering a great service to t=\r\noday&#39;s society and we pray to DeviMa to keep showing you the way.\n\nThank yo=\r\nu for sharing so much!\n\nHumble regards,\nVipin\n\n\n\r\n---1567787229-138093878-1335159442=:86388\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ti=\r\nmes new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:14pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;RIGHT: =\r\nauto&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;Respected vipin&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=\r\n=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp; &lt;FONT size=3D3&gt;You can perform hamam on follwing&nbsp;&lt;FONT siz=\r\ne=3D4&gt;YOGAS&lt;/FONT&gt; from &lt;FONT size=3D6&gt;PACHANG &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D6&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;RIGHT:=\r\n auto&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D3&gt;SIDDHA YOGA, SHIV YOGA, SADHYA YOGA, SHUBH YOGA, SHUK=\r\nLA YOGA, BHRAHMA YOGA.
