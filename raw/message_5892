I was thinking=\r\n that I am having some &#39;Hocus-Pocus illusions&#39; :)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have one more =\r\ndoubt. In my regular sadhna practice, Sometimes I am doing very good and co=\r\nncentration,experience is very good. But sometimes concentration is very po=\r\nor, I dont even want to meditate. Even slight meditation feels like headach=\r\ne because of poor concentration. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is basically like hiting peak=\r\n and bottom turn by turn. After I hit bottom I start to improve and after i=\r\n touch peak I fall down suddenly. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I understand that this is due t=\r\no my own incompetency in sadhna. Most probably I commit some mistake when a=\r\nt peak and then I loose my balance. But I make mistakes even when I am goin=\r\ng up, but then I do not loose balance and instead i rectify my mistakes ver=\r\ny well. When I am having my best experience, a small mistake make me loose =\r\nmy balance.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I dont know why this happens. Does this happen to ever=\r\nyone or I am lacking ability to do sadhna? This disappoints me a lot. Durin=\r\ng some days I even do not do my regular practice and I feel that I am not w=\r\northy of doing sadhna. I feel guilty of forgetting Krishna. Suddenly lot an=\r\nd lot of non-sense questions and stupid ideas arise in mind and I am totall=\r\ny confused. During those days, I dont even remember Krishna. I dont even wa=\r\nnt to hymn my favourite mantra. I do not bother about pleasant experience. =\r\nI know these are not my aim. But I feel disappointed for forgetting Krishna=\r\n. During these days every day feels like I have forgotten him since decades=\r\n. This disappoints me even more.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Does this happen to everyone?
