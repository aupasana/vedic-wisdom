Is it \nok?...\n\nI agree in =\r\nprinciple what you suggest in email about faster progress, \nbut, there are =\r\nso many ways to realize god, bhakti, nam sankirtan, \nmanav seva or any type=\r\n of seva or mantra yoga, hath yoga etc. There \nare so many, I am sure I can=\r\nnot list all.\n\nIt depends on the sanskars or accumulated impressions of a s=\r\nadhak as \nto which path will help better, we donot know that for sure excep=\r\nt \nfor Siddha Sadaguru.\n\nAlso a lot of people donot even have means to eat =\r\nor cloth how will \nthey do homam, even if they read this on the internet? W=\r\nhat will \nhappen to their feelings and mind. Does that mean they cannot rea=\r\nlize \nGod in a speedy way?\n\nAlong with Parashara we also have bhagvatam whi=\r\nch signifies in \nkaliyuga naam sankirtan and similar other documents offer =\r\nother \nmethods, all these are equally important and valuable.\n\nA good way i=\r\ns to accept all paths that lead to self realization\nand suggest that homan =\r\nis also a very good way. I hope that you \nplease accept this in a positive =\r\nway.\n\nVery Happy Shivratri to you and all members.\n\nBest Regards\nMitesh\n\n\n\n=\r\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; \nwrot=\r\ne:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Along the lines of other short homam manuals =\r\nthat are available on \nthe homam website below, a short Shiva homam manual =\r\nis available now. \nThis homam is simple and short enough to be performed da=\r\nily or weekly \nor monthly.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It has many options for the main mantra us=\r\ned. Instead of doing a \nlittle of each mantra and covering many mantras, I =\r\nsuggest picking \nany ONE mantra and doing it as many times as one can. If o=\r\nne is \nunable to choose a mantra, I suggest Mrityunjaya mantra. If one want=\r\ns \na simpler mantra, I suggest &quot;Om hreem namashshivaaya&quot;. However, there \na=\r\nre many options in the manual.\n&gt;  \n&gt; My advance greetings for a happy Maha =\r\nShivaratri!\n&gt;  \n&gt; It is hoped that spiritual seekers take advantage of this=\r\n manual.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Company of fire has a highly beneficial effect on mind and h=\r\nomam \n(fire ritual) is far more effective than japam (meditation) in \npurif=\r\nying mind and removing obstacles. Almost all the remedial \nmeasures (upayas=\r\n) taught by Maharshi Parasara in Brihat Parasara Hora \nSastram (BPHS) invol=\r\nve homam and not japam. As the internal purifying \nfire within individuals =\r\nbecomes weaker with deepening Kali yuga, \nvalue of external fire in meditat=\r\nion increases. Meditation without an \nexternal fire is much slower and less=\r\n efficient for most people.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Homam manuals for Mahaganapathi, Chandi, =\r\nKrishna, Mahalakshmi, \nSaturn and Mars are already there on the website. We=\r\n will slowly add \nmanuals for more deities.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha=\r\n\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do =\r\na Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tar=\r\npanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http=\r\n://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http:/=\r\n/vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.=\r\nVedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJag=\r\nannath.org\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
