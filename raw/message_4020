With a=\r\n weak mind I lost on her and in return she took away something I was very a=\r\nttached to. (BTW applaud to all those who chandi homam on a regular basis)\n=\r\nAs goddess Chandi is the powerful form of Goddess Durga. I feel maybe Godde=\r\nss Durga might be a bit gentle. Can you guide me about this god and would i=\r\nt be ok if I do her homam instead? In all your manuals you have explained n=\r\nature of various gods. Can you please tell me about Goddess durga in a simi=\r\nlar fashion? Kindly correct me if I am wrong anywhere in my understanding. =\r\nThanks for your kind guidance always,\n\nRegards,\nPriya\n\n\n\n"}}
