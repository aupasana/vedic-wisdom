Sabda is vibration. When you speak something loud, motion of your vocal cords will move air particles around you and the vibration will eventually move the the diaphragm in someone&#39;s physical ear and someone will perceive the sound.\n \nBut, this is the vibration caused in the domain of the gross physical body. These gross vibrations are accompanied by some subtle vibrations. In the domain of the subtle body, the thoughts of the subtle mind and the intentions will cause vibration of subtle matter around one and reach the subtle bodies of people around one.\n \nThe vibrations produced by mantras at various levels combine together to form a protective layer. Even if one chants a mantra loud and with perfect pronunciation, there may be undesirable thoughts in the mind and the overall vibration may be bad or weak. The real (or more important) aspect of the vibrations caused by mantras are at the subtle levels and not at the gross level. Thus, what thoughts you are getting and how focused your mind is is far more important than how loud and clearly you are pronouncing.\n \n*        *        *\n \nHaving said that, do your best to pronounce correctly. If you suspect your pronunciation is wrong, slow down a little, watch carefully, practice and rectify errors.\n \nIf your mind is not focused and getting distracted by undesirable thoughts, keep trying to focus it better. Rome is not built in a day. Try to remove the expectation that something will happen now. Try to remove the guilt that you are unable to do good sadhana or making mistakes. Try to remove mental agitation whenever you discover that your focus is not good.\n \nThe weird thoughts that you mentioned are like a heckler who disrupts a speech you are giving. Do not panic and do not debate with the heckler. Let the heckler say what he says. Just take note of him and move on with the speech. In other words, when your mind is aware that it is focusing on a weird thought instead of mantra, do not panic, take note of that fact and move on. Consciously (but with no panic or guilt or agitation) steer the mind back to mantra. Of course, it may move to another weird thought soon. THAT is the nature of mind. Keep pulling it back to focus on the mantra.\n \nAs you keep doing it, oneday it may click and you may be able to focus perfectly on a mantra.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- rajesh rajgor &lt;rajesh_rajgor2003@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Pranaam Narsimhaji\n&gt;  \n&gt; I have been reciting daily durga shaptashati since past 6 months. Initially i took more then one and half hour to read all 13 chapters. Now i can read it within 45 minutes. I came to understand that pronounciation of each shlokas is very important. i am sure i am making lot many mistakes in  pronounciating each shlokas. How to correct myself? Wrong pronounciation of shlokas may affect my spiritual progress or will IT adversely affect me spiritually or materially ? I have also heard that reciting chandi path loudly will create NAD BRAHMA around individual which protects him or her from all evils. So reciting loudly or moderatly loudly is best or reciting in mind is best? \n&gt;  \n&gt; Considering my personal experience, i have felt that each day i am getting different feelings. Sometimes my mind is fully involved in this.. sometimes there are lot many bombarding of weird thoughts in the mind while reciting chandi path and while performing daily vishnu homam too. But i ignore and i continue both without fail. Hope this attitude of mine is proper during such situations..\n&gt;  \n&gt; Kindly guide.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Regards\n&gt;  \n&gt; Rajesh\n\n\n"}}
