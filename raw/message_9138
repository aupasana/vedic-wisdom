This is India&#39;s unique and =\r\ndeathless contribution to the world&#39;s treasury of knowledge. \n\nThe life for=\r\nce, which is ordinarily absorbed in maintaining the heart-pump, must be fre=\r\ned for higher activities by a method of calming and stilling the ceaseless =\r\ndemands of the breath.&quot; The Kriya Yogi mentally directs his life energy to =\r\nrevolve, upward and downward, around the six spinal centers (medullary, cer=\r\nvical, dorsal, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal plexuses) which correspond to =\r\nthe twelve astral signs of the zodiac, the symbolic Cosmic Man. One-half mi=\r\nnute of revolution of energy around the sensitive spinal cord of man effect=\r\ns subtle progress in his evolution; that half-minute of Kriya equals one ye=\r\nar of natural spiritual unfoldment.\n \nThe astral system of a human being, w=\r\nith six (twelve by polarity) inner constellations revolving around the sun =\r\nof the omniscient spiritual eye, is interrelated with the physical sun and =\r\nthe twelve zodiacal signs. All men are thus affected by an inner and an out=\r\ner universe. The ancient rishis discovered that man&#39;s earthly and heavenly =\r\nenvironment, in twelve-year cycles, push him forward on his natural path. T=\r\nhe scriptures aver that man requires a million years of normal, diseaseless=\r\n evolution to perfect his human brain sufficiently to express cosmic consci=\r\nousness. \n\nOne thousand Kriya practiced in eight hours gives the yogi, in o=\r\nne day, the equivalent of one thousand years of natural evolution: 365,000 =\r\nyears of evolution in one year. In three years, a Kriya Yogi can thus accom=\r\nplish by intelligent self-effort the same result which nature brings to pas=\r\ns in a million years. The Kriya short cut, of course, can be taken only by =\r\ndeeply developed yogis. With the guidance of a guru, such yogis have carefu=\r\nlly prepared their bodies and brains to receive the power created by intens=\r\nive practice.\n \nThe Kriya beginner employs his yogic exercise only fourteen=\r\n to twenty-eight times, twice daily. A number of yogis achieve emancipation=\r\n in six or twelve or twenty-four or forty-eight years. A yogi who dies befo=\r\nre achieving full realization carries with him the good karma of his past K=\r\nriya effort; in his new life he is harmoniously propelled toward his Infini=\r\nte Goal. \n\nThe body of the average man is like a fifty-watt lamp, which can=\r\nnot accommodate the billion watts of power roused by an excessive practice =\r\nof Kriya. Through gradual and regular increase of the simple and &quot;foolproof=\r\n&quot; methods of Kriya, man&#39;s body becomes astrally transformed day by day, and=\r\n is finally fitted to express the infinite potentials of cosmic energy=97th=\r\ne first materially active expression of Spirit. \n\nKriya Yoga has nothing in=\r\n common with the unscientific breathing exercises taught by a number of mis=\r\nguided zealots. Their attempts to forcibly hold breath in the lungs is not =\r\nonly unnatural but decidedly unpleasant. Kriya, on the other hand, is accom=\r\npanied from the very beginning by an accession of peace, and by soothing se=\r\nnsations of regenerative effect in the spine. The ancient yogic technique c=\r\nonverts the breath into mind. By spiritual advancement, one is able to cogn=\r\nize the breath as an act of mind=97a dream-breath. \n\nMany illustrations cou=\r\nld be given of the mathematical relationship between man&#39;s respiratory rate=\r\n and the variations in his states of consciousness. A person whose attentio=\r\nn is wholly engrossed, as in following some closely knit intellectual argum=\r\nent, or in attempting some delicate or difficult physical feat, automatical=\r\nly breathes very slowly. Fixity of attention depends on slow breathing; qui=\r\nck or uneven breaths are an inevitable accompaniment of harmful emotional s=\r\ntates: fear, lust, anger. \n\nThe restless monkey breathes at the rate of 32 =\r\ntimes a minute, in contrast to man&#39;s average of 18 times. The elephant, tor=\r\ntoise, snake and other animals noted for their longevity have a respiratory=\r\n rate which is less than man&#39;s. The tortoise, for instance, who may attain =\r\nthe age of 300 years,* breathes only 4 times per minute. \n\n\n"}}
