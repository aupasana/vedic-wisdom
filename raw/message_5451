Just now , only I got the opportunity of =\r\njoining the Group by God&#39;d grace.  Since very long I have been guided by on=\r\ne article which I have collected  and kept with me. The author of the artic=\r\nle is not known. I feel ashamed even to say so. Still I feel I should bring=\r\n the same to the notice of all and if possible collect the information on t=\r\nhe article which is as below.\n\n&quot;                              TOLERANCE\n\nSp=\r\niritual progress requires systematic efforts on the part of the aspirant to=\r\n be imbued with various positive qualities. Tolerance however is one essent=\r\nial quality the momentary feeling of which can destroy all the good work th=\r\ne aspirant has done for years. Tolerance therefore needs to be cultivated i=\r\nn all earnestness.\n\n   The path of spiritual progress is full of pitfalls. =\r\n Every now and then a sadhaka is tempted and tested. Sometimes he is subjec=\r\nted to ridicule and insults.  Apparently unreasonable demands are made on h=\r\nim.  He is proved &quot;guilty &quot;for no fault of his own. In such testing times T=\r\nolerance is weapon to shield one shelf with. The movement it fleets, anger =\r\ntakes over, a sadhaka does or says things which he should not have. Later o=\r\nn he repents. But the damage  is done. The test proves its point. To be tol=\r\nerant is to be ever watch full of one&#39;s thoughts and actions. One should no=\r\nt allow one self to be excited by the way events.  Instead  all happenings =\r\nin one&#39;s life should be viewed with a sense of contentment and calmness. Th=\r\nis attitude wins over anger and ego =96 the two main culprits who ensure sp=\r\niritual downfall. A tolerant person is an alert person. He conducts himself=\r\n with forbearance in his day to day activities.\n\nIn tolerance alone are var=\r\nious virtues like forgiveness , mercy, peace, humility, love, contentment  =\r\ne. t. c. Tolerance leads to control of mind and hence progress on the spiri=\r\ntual path.&quot;\nI would like to share the above contents on this forum and requ=\r\nest everyone be benefited by the same.\n\nI would be grteful if any body know=\r\ns the author of the article you may please supplement the same.   asmurthy =\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
