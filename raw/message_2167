Es=\r\npecially the solar eclipse of July 22 occurs when Sun is in the 6th degree =\r\nof Cancer, which is Sun=E2=80=99s Mrityu Bhaga (death inflicting degree) in=\r\n Cancer. When the eclipse starts in New Delhi, Sun, Moon, Ketu and ascendan=\r\nt are in the same rasi and navamsa. Hence, this can be a problematic eclips=\r\ne.\n\nEclipse time is a very favorable time for spiritual sadhana, though tem=\r\nple rituals are halted during eclipses. There is a reason for it.\n\nSun and =\r\nMoon are the eyes of Parama Purusha (the supreme cosmic being). Microcosmic=\r\nally, individual soul (Sun) and individual mind (Moon) are the eyes through=\r\n which we see the dual world around us. If individual soul and individual m=\r\nind stop seeing, one no longer experiences any objects in the field of dual=\r\nity. The objectification within Brahman ceases and one is established in Br=\r\nahman, i.e. non-dual nirvikalpa samadhi. In other words, one realizes Self.=\r\n\n\nTo fulfil one=E2=80=99s dharma as an individual in the field of duality, =\r\none needs to be awake to the duality. One needs the individualized consciou=\r\nsness represented by Sun and Moon. Hence eclipse time when Sun or Moon is b=\r\nlocked is unfavorable for dharmik activities. Temples and temple rituals, w=\r\nhich are performed for collective dharma of society, are understandably hal=\r\nted. However, it is a great time for spiritual sadhana for self-realization=\r\n. This applies to homam as well. If one performs homam for material benefit=\r\ns, one should stop during an eclipse. However, if one performs homam for sp=\r\niritual progress and self-realization, a homam performed during an eclipse =\r\nis much more powerful than at other times. One can perform homam to any dei=\r\nty during an eclipse, though homam to an ugra devata may work better.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      See the Web&#39;s breaking stories, chosen by peop=\r\nle like you.
