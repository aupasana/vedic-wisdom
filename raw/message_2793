authentic scientific work that does\nnot need furth=\r\ner scientific verification. )\n \nThe story of Shri Rams&#39; life was first narr=\r\nated by Maharishi Valmiki in the Ramayana, which was written after Shri Ram=\r\n was crowned as the king of Ayodhya. \n\nMaharishi Valmiki was a great astron=\r\nomer as he has made sequential astronomical references on important dates r=\r\nelated to the life of Shri Ram indicating the location of planets,\nvis-a-vi=\r\ns, zodiac constellations and the other stars (nakshatras) .  Needless to ad=\r\nd that similar position of planets and nakshatras is not repeated in thousa=\r\nnds of years. \n\nBy entering the precise details of the planetary configurat=\r\nion of the important events in the life of Shri Ram as given in the Valmiki=\r\n Ramayan in the software named &quot;Planetarium&quot; corresponding exact dates of t=\r\nhese events according to the English calendar can be known.\n\nMr Pushkar Bha=\r\ntnagar of the Indian Revenue Service had acquired this software from the US=\r\n. It is used to predict the solar/lunar eclipses and distance and location =\r\nof other planets from earth. He entered the relevant details about the plan=\r\netary\npositions narrated by Maharishi Valmiki and obtained very interesting=\r\n and convincing results, which almost determine the important dates startin=\r\ng from the birth of Shri Ram to the date of his coming back to Ayodhya afte=\r\nr 14 years of exile.\n\nMaharishi Valmiki has recorded in Bal Kaand sarga 19 =\r\nand shloka eight and nine (1/18/8,9) that Shri Ram was born on ninth tithi =\r\nof Chaitra month when the position of different planets vis-a-vis zodiac co=\r\nnstellations and nakshatras\n(visible stars) were:  \na) Sun in Aries;  b) Sa=\r\nturn in Libra;  c) Jupiter in Cancer;  \nd) Venus in Pisces;  e) Mars in Cap=\r\nricorn; f) Lunar month of Chaitra;  g) Ninth day after no moon;  h) Lagna a=\r\ns Cancer (cancer was rising in the east);  i) Moon on the Punarvasu (Gemini=\r\n constellation & Pllux star); j) Day time (around noon).\n \nThis data was fe=\r\nd into the software. The results indicated that this was exactly the locati=\r\non of planets/stars in the noon of January 10, 5114 BC. Thus Shri Ram was b=\r\norn on January 10, 5114 BC (7123 years back). \n\nAs per the Indian calendar =\r\nit was the ninth day of Shukla Paksha in Chaitra month and the time was aro=\r\nund 12 to 1 noon time. This is exactly the time and date when Ram Navmi is =\r\ncelebrated all over India.\n\nShri Ram was born in Ayodhya. \n\nThis fact can b=\r\ne ascertained from several books written by Indian and foreign authors befo=\r\nre and after the birth of Christ - Valmiki Ramayan, Tulsi Ramayan, Kalidasa=\r\ns&#39; Raghuvansam,\nBaudh and Jain literature, etc. \n\nThese books have narrated=\r\n in great detail the location, rich architecture and beauty of Ayodhya whic=\r\nh had many palaces and temples built all over the kingdom. Ayodhya was loca=\r\nted on the banks of the Saryu river with Ganga and Panchal Pradesh on one s=\r\nide and Mithila on the other side. \n\nNormally 7,000 years is a very long pe=\r\nriod during which earthquakes, storms, floods and foreign invasions change =\r\nthe\ncourse of rivers, destroy the towns/buildings and alter the territories=\r\n. \n\nTherefore, the task of unearthing the facts is monumental. The present =\r\nAyodhya has shrunk in size and the rivers have changed their course about 4=\r\n0 km north/south. Shri Ram went out of Ayodhya in his childhood (13th year =\r\nas per Valmiki Ramayan) with Rishi Vishwamitra who lived in Tapovan (Sidhha=\r\nshram) . \n\nFrom there he went to Mithila, King Janakas&#39; kingdom. Here he ma=\r\nrried Sita after breaking Shiv Dhanusha (bow).\n\nResearchers have gone along=\r\n the route adopted by Shri Ram as narrated in the Valmiki Ramayan and found=\r\n 23 places which have memorials that commemorate the events related to the =\r\nlife of Shri Ram.. These include Shringi Ashram, Ramghat, Tadka Van, Sidhha=\r\nshram, Gautamashram, Janakpur (now in Nepal), Sita Kund, etc. \n\nMemorials a=\r\nre built for great men and not for fictitious characters.\n\nDate of exile of=\r\n Shri Ram: It is mentioned in Valmiki Ramayans&#39; Ayodhya Kand (2/4/18) that =\r\nDashratha wanted to make Shri Ram the king because Sun, Mars and Rahu had s=\r\nurrounded his nakshatra and normally under such planetary configuration the=\r\n king dies or becomes a victim of conspiracies. \n\nDashratha&#39;s zodiac sign w=\r\nas Pisces and his nakshatra was Rewati. This planetary configuration was pr=\r\nevailing on the January 5, 5089 BC, and it was on this day that Shri Ram le=\r\nft\nAyodhya for 14 years of exile. Thus, he was 25 years old at that time (5=\r\n114-5089). There are several shlokas in Valmiki Ramayan which indicate that=\r\n Shri Ram was 25-years-old when he left Ayodhya for exile. \n\nValmiki Ramaya=\r\nn refers to the solar eclipse at the time of war with Khardushan in later h=\r\nalf of 13th year of Shri Rams&#39; exile. It is also mentioned it was amavasya =\r\nday and Mars was\n in the middle ... When this data was entered, the softwar=\r\ne indicated that there was a solar eclipse on October 7, 5077 BC,\n(amavasya=\r\n day) which could be seen from Panchvati. \n\nThe planetary configuration was=\r\n also the same - Mars was in the middle, on one side were Venus and Mercury=\r\n and on the other side were Sun and Saturn. \n\nOn the basis of planetary con=\r\nfigurations described in various other chapters, the date on which Ravana w=\r\nas killed works out to be December 4, 5076 BC, and Shri Ram completed 14 ye=\r\nars of exile on January 2, 5075 BC, and that day was also Navami of Shukla =\r\nPaksha in Chaitra month. \n\nThus Shri Ram had come back to Ayodhya at the ag=\r\ne of 39 (5114-5075). \n\nA colleague, Dr Ram Avtar, researched on places visi=\r\nted by Shri Ram during his exile, and sequentially moved to the places stat=\r\ned as visited by Shri Ram in the Valmiki Ramayan; starting from Ayodhya he =\r\nwent right upto Rameshwaram. He found 195 places which still have the memor=\r\nials connected to the events narrated in the Ramayana relating to the life =\r\nof Shri Ram and Sita. These include Tamsa Tal (Mandah), Shringverpur (Singr=\r\naur), Bhardwaj Ashram (situated near Allahabad), Atri Ashram, Markandaya As=\r\nhram (Markundi),\nChitrakoot, Pamakuti (on banks of Godavari), Panchvati, Si=\r\nta Sarovar, Ram Kund in Triambakeshwar near Nasik, Shabari Ashram, Kishkind=\r\nha (village Annagorai), Dhanushkoti and Rameshwar temple.\n\nIn Valmiki Ramay=\r\nan it is mentioned that Shri Ram&#39;s army constructed a bridge over the sea b=\r\netween Rameshwaram and Lanka. After crossing this bridge, Shri Rams&#39; army h=\r\nad defeated Ravana. \n\nRecently, NASA put pictures on the Internet of a man-=\r\nmade bridge, the ruins of which are lying submerged in Palk Strait between =\r\nRameshwaram and Sri Lanka.\n\nRecently the Sri Lankan Government had expresse=\r\nd the desire to develop Sita Vatika as a tourist spot. Sri Lankans believe =\r\nthis was Ashok Vatika where Ravana had kept Sita as a prisoner (in 5076 BC)=\r\n.\n\nIndian history has recorded that Shri Ram belonged to the Suryavansh and=\r\n he was the 64th ruler of this dynasty. The names and other relevant partic=\r\nulars of previous 63 kings are listed in Ayodhya Ka Itihas written about 80=\r\n years ago by Rai Bahadur Sita Ram. \n\nProfessor Subhash Kak of Lousiana Uni=\r\nversity, in his book, The Astronomical Code of the Rig Veda, has also liste=\r\nd 63 ancestors of Shri Ram who ruled over Ayodhya.\n\nSri Rams&#39; ancestors hav=\r\ne been traced out as: Shri Ram, King Dashratha, King Aja, King Raghu, King =\r\nDilip and so on. From Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Bengal to Gujarat, ev=\r\nerywhere people believe in the reality of Shri Rams&#39; existence, particularl=\r\ny in the tribal areas of Himaachal, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and the North=\r\n-East.\n\nMost of the festivals celebrated in these areas revolve around the =\r\nevents in the life of Shri Ram and Shri Krishna. The events and places rela=\r\nted to the life of Shri Ram and Sita are true\ncultural and social heritage =\r\nof every Indian irrespective of caste and creed. Therefore, it is common he=\r\nritage. \n\nAfter all, Shri Ram belonged to the period when Prophet Mohammed =\r\nor Jesus Christ were not born and Muslim or Christian faiths were unknown t=\r\no the world.\n\nThe words Hindu (resident of Hindustan) and Indian (resident =\r\nof India) were synonymous. India was also known as Bharat (land of knowledg=\r\ne) and Aryavarta (where Aryans live) and Hindustan (land of &quot;Hindus&quot; - deri=\r\nved from word Indus).\n\nDuring Ram Rajya (rule), the evils of caste system b=\r\nased on birth were non-existent. \n\nIn fact, Maharishi Valmiki is stated to =\r\nbe of shudra class\n(scheduled caste), still Sita lived with him as his adop=\r\nted daughter after she was banished from Ayodhya. Luv and Kush grew in his =\r\nashram as his disciples.. \n\nWe need to be proud of the fact that Valmiki wa=\r\ns perhaps\nthe first great astronomer and that his study of planetary config=\r\nurations has stood the test of times. \n\nEven the latest computer softwares =\r\nhave corroborated his astronomical calculations, which proves that he did n=\r\not\ncommit any error. Shabari is stated to be belonging to the Bheel tribe..=\r\n\n\nShri Ram&#39;s army, which succeeded in defeating Ravana, was formed by vario=\r\nus tribals from Central and South India. \n\nThe facts, events and all other =\r\ndetails relating to the life of Shri Ram are the common heritage of all the=\r\n Indians including scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, Muslims, Christians,=\r\n etc.\n\nProphet Mohammad was born 1,400 years ago. Jesus Christ was born 2,0=\r\n00 years back. Gautam Buddha was born 2,600 years back, whereas Ram was bor=\r\nn 7,000 years ago. \n\nHence, discovering the details relating to Shri Rams&#39; =\r\nlife would be lot more difficult as destruction caused by floods, earthquak=\r\nes and invasions etc., would be far greater. But, should that stop our ques=\r\nt for learning more about our cultural heritage?\n\nAs Indians, let us all ta=\r\nke pride in the fact that the Indian civilization is the most ancient civil=\r\nisation today. It is certainly more than 10,000 years old. Therefore, let u=\r\ns reject the story of Aryan invasion in India in 1,500 BC as motivated impl=\r\nantation. \n\nIn fact Max Mueller, who was the creator of this theory, had hi=\r\nmself rejected it. \n\nLet us admit that during the British Rule, we were edu=\r\ncated in the schools based on Macaulay school of thinking which believed th=\r\nat everything Indian was inferior and that entire &quot;Indian literature was no=\r\nt worth even one book rack in England.&quot; \n\nIf there were similarities in cer=\r\ntain features of Indian people and people from Central Europe, then automat=\r\nic inference drawn was that the Aryans coming from Europe invaded India and=\r\n settled here. No one dared of thinking in any other way.\n\nTherefore, there=\r\n is urgency for the historians and all other intellectuals to stop reducing=\r\n Indian history to myth. There is need to gather, dig out, search, unearth =\r\nand analyze all the evidences, which would throw more light on the ancient =\r\nIndian civilization and culture..\n\n\n  \n                                \n(-)=\r\n(-)(-)(-) (-)(-)(-) (-)(-)(-) (-)(-)(-) (-)(-)(-) (-)(-)(-) (-)(-)\n   \nRash=\r\nmi Patel                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n   \n\n\n      \r\n--0-489924889-1254887932=:38933\r\nContent-Type: text/html;

Therefore, let us reject the story of Aryan invasion&nbsp;in Indi=\r\na in 1,500 BC as motivated implantation.&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span clas=\r\ns=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:large;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;f=\r\nont size=3D&quot;4&quot;&gt;In fact Max Mueller,&nbsp;who was the creator of this theory=\r\n, had himself rejected it.&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-sty=\r\nle-span&quot; style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:large;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;4&quot;=\r\n&gt;Let us&nbsp;admit that during the British Rule, we were educated in the sc=\r\nhools&nbsp;based on Macaulay school of thinking which believed that&nbsp;ev=\r\nerything Indian was inferior and that entire &quot;Indian literature was&nbsp;no=\r\nt worth even one book rack in England.&quot;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\r\n=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:large;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;fo=\r\nnt size=3D&quot;4&quot;&gt;If there were similarities&nbsp;in certain features of Indian=\r\n people and people from Central Europe,&nbsp;then automatic inference drawn=\r\n was that the Aryans coming from&nbsp;Europe invaded India and settled here=\r\n. No one dared of thinking in&nbsp;any other way.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span c=\r\nlass=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:large;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;4&quot;&gt;Therefore, there is urgency for the historians and all ot=\r\nher intellectuals&nbsp;to stop reducing Indian history to myth.
