Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am a full-tim=\r\ne engineer. I am working as a software manager at a \n&gt; semi-conductor compa=\r\nny making SoC (System-on-Chip) solutions for the \n&gt; blu-ray/DVD market. Sev=\r\neral blu-ray/DVD players containing software written \n&gt; by me and my group =\r\nare being sold at &quot;Best Buy&quot; now. We sometimes work 12-15 \n&gt; hours a day an=\r\nd weekends too. For example, I was at work this Sunday.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, it is=\r\n difficult to compare one&#39;s life with another&#39;s, as each has \n&gt; different c=\r\nircumstances. For example, I have a wife who shares my interests \n&gt; and co-=\r\noperates. I have people around me who carry some positive spiritual \n&gt; vibr=\r\nations. Someone else may have different situation.\n&gt; \n&gt; What I say is this:=\r\n Do the best you can, based on your constraints, \n&gt; circumstances and life =\r\ngoals.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, I see that most people DO have some time but tend to s=\r\npend it on \n&gt; not so useful activities. They spend time surfing internet, t=\r\nhey spend time \n&gt; playing internet games, they spend time on a lot of email=\r\ns, they spend time \n&gt; on TV, they spend time on activities like playing car=\r\nds etc etc. If one \n&gt; really looks, one can always find some time.\n&gt; \n&gt; One=\r\n person I know, another software engineer, was doing a Mahaganapathi \n&gt; hom=\r\nam everyday. Then he switched to Chandi homam everyday. This made his \n&gt; li=\r\nfestyle tight. Now he is doing one Chandi homam in the morning and another =\r\n\n&gt; Chandi homam in the evening, everyday. It is just a matter of prioritizi=\r\nng \n&gt; spiritual sadhana appropriately so that there is time for it. We can =\r\ndo \n&gt; thousands of things, but have time to do only a few things. We choose=\r\n the \n&gt; few things we do based on our sense of priority. Until spiritual sa=\r\ndhana \n&gt; becomes a priority for you, not much can be done about it..\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\nhe thing with homam is that it is the most efficient method for those with =\r\n\n&gt; limited time. Even an half hour homam done everyday will make a lot of \n=\r\n&gt; difference over the long run.\n&gt; \n&gt; If one has absolutely no time for homa=\r\nm, japam etc, one can atleast do \n&gt; internal sadhana, i.e. redirect the thi=\r\nnking and attitude in various \n&gt; activities done throughout the day.\n&gt; \n&gt; E=\r\nspecially in big cities around the world where people are always running \n&gt;=\r\n and filled with too much rajas and tamas do some serious sadhakas need to =\r\n\n&gt; come up and do serious sadhana like daily homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; We waste a lot of =\r\nemotional and intellectual energy dwelling on irrelevant \n&gt; things. We bask=\r\n &quot;He likes me..he praised me so much&quot;. We sulk &quot;he was unfair \n&gt; in critici=\r\nzing me&quot;. And so on. Lingering emotions in our interactions with \n&gt; others =\r\ntake up a lot of emotional and intellectual energy and we are left \n&gt; with =\r\nno energy for doing important things. Try to free your mind from \n&gt; lingeri=\r\nng emotions, conserve the emotional energy and see if it makes a \n&gt; differe=\r\nnce.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Vedic=\r\nAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrolog=\r\ner.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;=\r\n Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyot=\r\nish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Cent=\r\nre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ---------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- =\r\n\n&gt; From: &quot;suvarnatejas&quot; &lt;suvarnatejas@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, March 09, 2009 12:06 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Bala=\r\nnce of family responsibilities and Sadhana\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Shri Narasimha:\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Can you shed some light on you personally balanced your\n&gt; &gt; family l=\r\nife and your spiritual endeavors?\n&gt; &gt; How do you manage your professional\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; life (software engineering?), family responsibilities (children)\n&gt; &gt; etc=\r\n as well as find time for homam/meditation etc.\n&gt; &gt; Are you still working f=\r\null-time as an engineer?\n&gt; &gt; I hope this is not a very personal question.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A regular hectic life in any modern city (Boston or Bangalore)\n&gt; &gt; s=\r\neems to consume the physical energy of a person, and I find that\n&gt; &gt; there =\r\nis about an hour&#39;s worth of time for any prayer.
