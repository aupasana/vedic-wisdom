Its=\r\n supposed to be exercised in meditations by advance students. Its was never=\r\n meant to be a casual spiritual book, but guess it has become one. That is =\r\nlike the last course in Phd.\n\nBuddha taught only one text over 300 times in=\r\n his life and that was his focus. but sadly its seen as too general and eas=\r\ny. go find this one. :)  (Durgas sense of humor)\n\nThere are such texts in I=\r\nndia also but didnt manage to get a catchy title like &quot;hindu book of dead&quot;.=\r\n In some FB forums there are senior sadhaks who access these bardo sort of =\r\nstates like walk in park.

Th=\r\ne Atman is sexless, but the Atman in female form has been treated worse tha=\r\nn the Atman in male form over the centuries...even today it is being murder=\r\ned in the womb (female foeticide), raped, burnt in Sati etc etc. Yes yes it=\r\n is deathless etc, but while in this ignorant state, it still suffers in th=\r\ne form of women. I hasten to add that I am no feminist but right now, I&#39;m f=\r\nurious with Durga. How outrageous that for centuries, and even today, women=\r\n were not allowed to be initiated into the Gayatri (which is to the Goddess=\r\n). Why aren&#39;t there more women saints? The ratio of female to male saints i=\r\ns probably 1:10. It&#39;s bloody disheartening. And what is the point of coveri=\r\nng us with ignorance (it&#39;s her fault, she is the Avidya Maya), and then yel=\r\nling at us for not being wise (as she does in all the scriptures). If she w=\r\nants to save us, she will have to create in us the desire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  to do =\r\njapa or whatever. I wash my hands of the whole thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nSo don&#39;t tell us to chant, tell her to tell us to chant. Like she told you =\r\nto.
