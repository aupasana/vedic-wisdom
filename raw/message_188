Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, I use drigdasa taught by Maharshi Parasara for\n&gt; timing spiritual \n&gt; progress astrologically. This dasa applies to all\n&gt; people&#39;s charts.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I said earlier, I am a little hesitant to teach\n&gt; Chandi homam publicly, \n&gt; unlike Mahaganapathi homam. If She inspires me in\n&gt; future to do so, I may.\n&gt; \n&gt; Chandi homam is quite powerful. If one with strong\n&gt; desires performs it well \n&gt; for a period of time, one can fulfil most desires.\n&gt; Thus, there is scope for \n&gt; abuse. Of course, the abuse cannot take place unless\n&gt; She wills it. It may be \n&gt; Her will to make someone use this in a particular\n&gt; way and some negative \n&gt; karma to be generated. However, the law of &quot;equal\n&gt; reaction to actions&quot; is \n&gt; unbreakable and one will have to experience the\n&gt; fruits of the karma \n&gt; incurred. To a self-realized person, no karma sticks\n&gt; and hence no fruit of a \n&gt; karma sticks. When someone like Ramakrishna\n&gt; Paramahamsa or Ramana Maharshi \n&gt; gets throat cancer for example, they may remain\n&gt; unaffected by it and see the \n&gt; suffering of the body in the same way a physical\n&gt; pleasure is seen. But, \n&gt; someone who is not there yet and someone who\n&gt; experiences fruits of different \n&gt; karmas differently still (instead of looking at them\n&gt; the same way), needs to \n&gt; be careful in choosing which karmas to undertake and\n&gt; which to avoid.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the other extreme, if one performs Chandi homam\n&gt; well for a period of time \n&gt; without much desire, She can put one on the fast\n&gt; track and give a high level \n&gt; of detachment and very quick spiritual progresss. It\n&gt; can sometimes be too \n&gt; quick for the person.\n&gt; \n&gt; Chandi is the union of Mahakaali, Mahalakshmi and\n&gt; Mahasaraswati - three root \n&gt; energies behind the creation, sustenance and\n&gt; destruction of this universe. \n&gt; She is the primordial energy of this universe. She\n&gt; is too powerful.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do Ganapathi Homam Yourself:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Spirituality:\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3):\n&gt; http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows):\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website:\n&gt; http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;Gaurav Kapur&quot; &lt;groovyacharya@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, February 03, 2008 1:27 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Need more help\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimhaji:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now that this question on spiritual growth has\n&gt; come.\n&gt; &gt; What dasha do you suggest to c spiritual growth.\n&gt; Do\n&gt; &gt; you use Drigdasha or have used it in this case\n&gt; only.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also I was wondering when you can guide us on how\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; perform Chandi homam.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thank you\n&gt; &gt; Gaurav\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

People find their path,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; make some progress and then\n&gt; &gt;&gt; feel lost again.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; You run the drigdasa of Pisces from March 2008 to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; March 2017. Taking Cancer\n&gt; &gt;&gt; as progressed lagna in Pisces dasa, the 9th house\n&gt; &gt;&gt; will be strong with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Mercury and Sun and the 9th lord Jupiter will be\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; lagna. The 8th house\n&gt; &gt;&gt; will be prominent with Mars and Ketu, with 8th\n&gt; lords\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Saturn and Rahu\n&gt; &gt;&gt; aspecting them from 2nd. These 4 malefics on the\n&gt; 8th\n&gt; &gt;&gt; house axis strongly\n&gt; &gt;&gt; suggest powerful mystical experiences.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; You are on the verge of a rewarding time\n&gt; spiritually\n&gt; &gt;&gt; speaking. Just keep\n&gt; &gt;&gt; your faith and patience for a few more years and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; keep doing your sadhana.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The 5th house of devotion has Moon in rasi and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; vimsamsa. This shows devotion\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to Krishna. In navamsa, the 12th from atma karaka\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; empty and Mercury owns\n&gt; &gt;&gt; it. Mercury is in Scorpio with Rahu. This\n&gt; suggests\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that worship of Lord\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Varaha (Vishnu&#39;s boar incarnation) can give you\n&gt; fast\n&gt; &gt;&gt; spiritual progress.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Please contact suresh.battar@...\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (http://ashramaustralia.net) and ask\n&gt; &gt;&gt; him where you can get a homa kundam in Australia.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Swami Suresh Battar is a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hindu priest in Canberra. In case homa kundas are\n&gt; &gt;&gt; available there, he may be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; able to direct you. In the worst case, any square\n&gt; or\n&gt; &gt;&gt; circle shaped vessel\n&gt; &gt;&gt; with some depth (made of copper or bronze but not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; iron) can be used. Good\n&gt; &gt;&gt; luck for your homam.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Regarding books, there are too many. But direct\n&gt; &gt;&gt; experience through\n&gt; &gt;&gt; meditation is a far better teacher than books.\n&gt; Just\n&gt; &gt;&gt; surrender to the Lord,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; accept wholeheartedly that all the diverse\n&gt; objects\n&gt; &gt;&gt; our senses perceive in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; this universe are all different manifestations of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the Lord and that we are\n&gt; &gt;&gt; perceiving them differently because of our own\n&gt; &gt;&gt; impurity. If we keep\n&gt; &gt;&gt; reminding ourselves of this whenever our mind is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; overly attracted to or\n&gt; &gt;&gt; repelled by something, that itself is a very\n&gt; useful\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sadhana. In addition, if\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you spend a considerable time everyday in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; meditation, that too helps.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; For you, I strongly recommend &quot;Jnaneshwari&quot;, a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; commentary on BhagavadGita by\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Jnaneshwar Maharaj. This is a unique commentary\n&gt; by a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; unique saint, who is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the re-incarnation of a rishi and had a direct\n&gt; &gt;&gt; dwaitic and adwaitic\n&gt; &gt;&gt; experience. There is a difference between\n&gt; writings\n&gt; &gt;&gt; coming from knowledge\n&gt; &gt;&gt; acquired by reading books or hearing from others\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; writings coming from\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the knowledge acquired in a direct experience.\n&gt; More\n&gt; &gt;&gt; than 700 years ago,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Jnaneshwar Maharaj entered a cave in Alandi in\n&gt; his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; physical body at the age\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of 21 years and still meditating there. I have\n&gt; NOT\n&gt; &gt;&gt; read a more competent or\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sublime commentary on Krishna&#39;s teaching. It is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; quite an inspired work. A\n&gt; &gt;&gt; good English translation of this work is\n&gt; available\n&gt; &gt;&gt; at\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Jnaneshwars-Gita-Jnaneshwari-Swami-Kripananda/dp/0911307648\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; is the highest work on Hindu\n&gt; \n=== message truncated ===\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better friend, newshound, and \nknow-it-all with Yahoo!
