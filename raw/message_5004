In-fact something VERY =\r\nstrage happened the first time I did my proper Tarpana (at the begining of =\r\nthis Pitri Paksha).\n\nAs I threw the remaining water in the pot (containing =\r\nleft over seasame seeds), I heard a strange voice at that exact moment I tu=\r\nrned the vessel upside down. For a few moments I got scared becasue the voi=\r\nce clearly came from the vessel. I strongly felt that there were some Jiva-=\r\nAtmas of my departed ancestors in the vessel (which to be honest I did not =\r\nexpect!!).\n\nWhile on one hand, this incident strengthened my faith, on the =\r\nother hand I can&#39;t help but feel that I may have dis-comforted my ancestors=\r\n by suddenly turnning the vessel up-side down.\n\nSince then, I had this exac=\r\nt same question in my mind.\n@Mitest: Thanks for bringing it up.\n\nWill reque=\r\nst the learned ones to guide/share their thoughts.\n\nReverntly,\nMahesh \n\n---=\r\n In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;m540i98&quot; &lt;m540i98@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namast=\r\ne\n&gt; \n&gt; In the tarpana process we invite all ancestors in the copper vessel\n=\r\n&gt; but in the end what should we do, request them to go back to their respec=\r\ntive places?\n&gt; \n&gt; I feel there should be line for the same.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also is it=\r\n ok to tarpana in the night say 8 or 9 pm?\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards\n&gt; Mitesh\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
