If so, which authoritat=\r\nive text have you relied upon? Or is it one designed by yourself keeping th=\r\ne convenience factor in mind ?\n=C2=A0\nThere are many procedures even within=\r\n the vedic system for performing homam. Each established procedure given by=\r\n acharyas=C2=A0 is complete=C2=A0in itself and do not violate the fundament=\r\nal principles of vedic rituals.\n=C2=A0\nIt will be interesting here to point=\r\n out that when some sections of samavedis when they perform sraadham=C2=A0d=\r\no the=C2=A0hormam on the palm of the bhokta brahmin. It is called panihomam=\r\n. Even the fire is not present there. It is based on a dictum called &quot; brah=\r\nmanasya dakshine haste hotavyam&quot; - the homa is to be performed on the right=\r\n hand of the brahmin. It is believed that agni is ever present in the right=\r\n hand of the srotriya (one learned in the veda) brahmin. There is no defect=\r\n here. It is as per sastra. Now if you modify this and say that homa can be=\r\n perfromed on the right glove worn by a brahmin, then the problem arises.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nAs you have said, any system of worship is acceptable. There are so =\r\nmany religions and cults all around the world. Nobody objects. If you call =\r\nsomething vedic, please make sure that it conforms to the vedic tenets.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nHomam is a ritualistic form of worship and if you bring in advaita vada=\r\n in it it doesn&#39;t work.\n=C2=A0\nIt is not a question of whether it is more e=\r\nlaborate or less elaborate or which is inferior or which is superior. It is=\r\n a question of whether it is correct and based on what vedic authority. If =\r\nyou are promoting this homa procedure as one of your own design, there is n=\r\no objection. On the contrary, if you need the sanction of vedic authority f=\r\nor it, please=C2=A0answer within the ambit of vedic knowledge=C2=A0if doubt=\r\ns are raised.\n=C2=A0\nThe apprehension is that in the year 2000 you said,\n=\r\n=C2=A0\n&quot;I cannot possibly finish this preface without expressing my deep gr=\r\natitude for my \nguru Pt. Sanjay Rath, who has been a constant source of enl=\r\nightenment, \nencouragement and inspiration. I am eternally grateful to him&quot;=\r\n\n=C2=A0\nand now you say\n=C2=A0\n&quot;In my well-considered view, Sanjay ji got s=\r\nome specific secrets and some generic guidelines (which may be imperfect, l=\r\nike with all other paramparas) from his elders. He then read some books and=\r\n formed his understanding. As he started teaching it, he received a lot of =\r\nadulation for the &quot;parampara secrets&quot;. I am afraid he got addicted to the a=\r\ndulation and started to manufacture &quot;parampara secrets&quot; after the initial r=\r\nun. Slowly he became commercial and he started selling manufactured &quot;paramp=\r\nara knowledge&quot;.\n=C2=A0\nYes, his teachings contain fascinating philosophizat=\r\nion, which is really superficial and does not stand any real scrutiny. His =\r\ntheories are like beautiful structures built with a pack of cards. Sanjay j=\r\ni always maintains an air of &quot;I know more, but will teach later&quot;. It is con=\r\nvenient to give the impression that there is more. If anything does not mak=\r\ne sense, it could be because you have to learn more!\n=C2=A0\nAs he started e=\r\nxploiting and commercializing half-baked and ill-conceived knowledge in the=\r\n name of a parampara, I took an exception to the commercialization and dish=\r\nonesty. After expressing my reservations privately and having no effect, I =\r\nstarted to go public, first subtly and later bluntly. After several clashes=\r\n, I was kicked out of SJC.\n=C2=A0\nWith basic concepts like houses, arudha p=\r\nadas, chara karakas, argalas etc, the generic guidelines he received are im=\r\nperfect. He deviates from Parasara in several matters and his teachings do =\r\nnot work consistently.\n=C2=A0\nBottomline: Sanjay ji&#39;s base is made of some =\r\nspecific secrets (that are imperfect) and some generic guidelines (that are=\r\n imperfect too). Starting from that base and reading books, he hastily crea=\r\nted a body of knowledge which he sells now. If there is anything in his tea=\r\nchings that can be used relatively reliably, it is TP.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nIn 2000 you =\r\nsaid\n=C2=A0\n\n&quot;Narayana dasa is a very important rasi dasa. It is a phalita =\r\ndasa. It shows general\nresults. Narayana dasa is computed differently for d=\r\nifferent divisional charts and we\ncan use Narayana dasa of a divisional cha=\r\nrt to predict matters related to that\ndivisional chart.\n=C2=A0\nNarayana das=\r\na is based on the progression of lagna in one=E2=80=99s life. As one dasa e=\r\nnds\nand another starts, one rasi stops being the progressed lagna and anoth=\r\ner rasi\nbecomes one=E2=80=99s progressed lagna. Using the progressed lagna =\r\nas the reference, we\nfind out the events that happen in that dasa. Thus we =\r\nget twelve charts for each\nperson, with each chart applicable in one dasa.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nThis is a very versatile dasa system and readers sould pay attention=\r\n to the details of\ncalculation.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nnow you say\n=C2=A0\n&quot;Narayana dasa m=\r\nay be based on some genuine parampara knowledge, but it does not work with =\r\nany level of consistency. I am afraid it needs refinement.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nYou seem=\r\n to start teaching even before you=C2=A0start learning.=C2=A0I&#39; m only afra=\r\nid it should not happen in the context of vedic rituals also.

There are many standard homam procedu=\r\nres in the world today, some more elaborate than what we teach and some mor=\r\ne brief. I do not care exactly what procedure one uses and I will be happy =\r\nif more and more people do homam *regularly*, irrespective of the exact pro=\r\ncedure used! What I teach is ONE procedure for those who do not know any. I=\r\nf you are initiated into a different procedure that you can do daily, pleas=\r\ne go ahead and do it daily the way you know it. That will make us very happ=\r\ny. However, if the method you know cannot be done daily, please consider wh=\r\nat I taught, which is simple enough to do daily.\n\n* * *\n\nSuppose there are =\r\nrules and protocols on how one should serve lunch to one&#39;s parents, e.g. ho=\r\nw to place the plates, spoons, forks, soup bowls, drink cups, dessert bowls=\r\n etc and how and in what order to serve various items in those containers. =\r\nSuppose the protocol is so complex that one cannot do it everyday and calls=\r\n one&#39;s parents for a lunch once every few months.\n\nIs that better or is it =\r\nbetter to relax the rules and protocols to make it less formal and serve lu=\r\nnch to parents everyday?\n\n* * *\n\n&gt; 21. I suggest that we preserve each bran=\r\nch of knowledge in its own purity.\n&gt; Hybrids may not always yield good resu=\r\nlts. Let almighty help to preserve\n&gt; knowledge uncorrupted.\n\nThe only knowl=\r\nedge that should (and can) be preserved without corruption is knowledge tha=\r\nt is *absolute*. Veda, or the knowledge of imperishable Self, alone is abso=\r\nlute knowledge.\n\nKnowledge of *external rituals* is relative and can never =\r\nbe absolute. It evolves based on desa-kaala-paatra. There is nothing impure=\r\n or corrupt about it.\n\nAt the end of the day, the key is whether one is act=\r\nually doing some sadhana on a regular basis or not, whether it is causing i=\r\nnternal transformation in one or not, and whether it helps in one&#39;s spiritu=\r\nal progress or not.\n\n* * *\n\nLet me cut & paste a section from a writeup I w=\r\nrote for an upcoming occasion. It contains an analogy given earlier and add=\r\nresses some relevant issues.\n\n-----------------------------\nDo Vedas Descri=\r\nbe External Rituals\n\nSome people believe that Veda describes the specifics =\r\nabout various external yagyas. Veda is supposed to be absolute, timeless an=\r\nd uncreated knowledge that is not bound by desa-kaala-paatra. How can descr=\r\niptions of specific external rituals be unbound by desa-kaala-paatra?\n\nThou=\r\ngh Sayanacharya=E2=80=99s celebrated commentary on RigVeda is ritualistic i=\r\nn nature, Aurobindo Ghose had a different take in his =E2=80=9CSecret of th=\r\ne Veda=E2=80=9D. His view is that Veda talks about absolute truths about th=\r\ne inner self and not relative truths about external matters. Agni or Fire s=\r\nymbolizes the divine Will. That is why it is the immortal in mortals. Its r=\r\nhythm will devour everything that is perishable and purify all. While fire =\r\nin a fire ritual symbolizes the divine Will, various offerings in it symbol=\r\nize various aspects of one=E2=80=99s conditioning and the smoke symbolizes =\r\none=E2=80=99s passions and desires.\n\nMetaphor: Vedic Homam vs Aagamic Homam=\r\n\n\nNotions that so and so yagya ritual is sanctioned by Veda and so and so a=\r\nagamic/tantric yagya ritual is not sanctioned by Veda can be put in perspec=\r\ntive using a metaphor.\n\nOnce there were many people who lived near the sea =\r\n[Aatman]. They regularly sat by the sea and enjoyed the sight and sound of =\r\nthe sea [absorbed in Aatman most of the time]. They described the sea in so=\r\nme nice cryptic poems [Veda].\n\nAs people started living a little away from =\r\nthe sea [less spiritually evolved], someone had to put together some instru=\r\nctions on how to reach the sea. He said, &quot;keep walking towards east&quot; and th=\r\ne instructions grew with time. People faithfully followed the instructions =\r\n[rituals].\n\nPeople started moving further and further inland and started li=\r\nving in a landlocked desert far away from the sea. This generation had neve=\r\nr seen a pool of water like a lake, let alone a sea. They faithfully perfor=\r\nmed the ritual of walking towards east, but did not find sea. They debated =\r\nendlessly whether one had to walk one mile or two miles or three miles and =\r\nformed different schools of thought. Some walked their chosen distance, fou=\r\nnd a tree or a building or some interesting object and even became satisfie=\r\nd that that was sea!\n\nThen came some great person, whose instincts led him =\r\nto take a horse instead of walking and ride it for a long distance [use of =\r\nother tools]. He did find the sea after a few months. He put together newer=\r\n instructions to reach the sea, which included riding a horse [new =C3=A4ga=\r\nma and tantra].\n\nPeople performing the old rituals objected to this and sai=\r\nd &quot;but then this horse thing is not granted by the book of sea. This is a n=\r\new path and different from the &quot;pure&quot; sea ritual&quot; [pure Vedic ritual]. By n=\r\now, people did not even understand what the cryptic poems of the original &quot;=\r\nbook of sea&quot; mean, but they simply believed that those poems taught the old=\r\n &quot;pure&quot; sea rituals that they were used to. They were blissfully unaware th=\r\nat the original instructions were meant for someone already close to sea an=\r\nd the newer instructions came from someone who actually saw the sea and kne=\r\nw where they currently lived and how to get to the sea from there!\n\nSlowly =\r\nmany new sets of instructions involving horses, chariots etc were taught an=\r\nd many new paths to the sea were outlined instead of just instructing peopl=\r\ne to walk towards east [evolution of mantra/tantra/yantras].\n\nOne particula=\r\nr path through jungles was dangerous [aghora and other dark tantric paths i=\r\nnvolving practice of sex, meat, wine etc]. Though the distance to sea was m=\r\nuch shorter through that jungle, it was just too dangerous and only the bra=\r\nvest and strongest could make it. There were cruel dacoits and wild animals=\r\n [chance of a fall in a risky ritual] and many weak people travelling to se=\r\na via that path were killed. A wise man who knew the entire territory well =\r\ncame forward, condemned that path and discouraged people from trying that p=\r\nath. Since then, even people who were strong enough to successfully make it=\r\n in that path desisted from it.\n\nAs time progressed, people started fightin=\r\ng too much about whose path was superior. They were foolish, not smart enou=\r\ngh to adopt the original instructions, of either the so-called &quot;pure&quot; sea p=\r\nath or the so-called &quot;new&quot; path or other variations, for the changed geogra=\r\nphy and changed times. Many followed the instructions blindly, hit roadbloc=\r\nks and did not reach sea. Many did not even know that &quot;reaching the sea&quot; wa=\r\ns the actual goal of all their joirneys. They only thought they were suppos=\r\ned to follow the instructions faithfully and there was no need to adopt to =\r\nthe changed geographical territory and time. They even condemned those who =\r\nactually went to sea, came back and gave updated directions for their place=\r\n and time, for violating tradition.\n\nIn case the analogy is not clear, here=\r\n is a brief summary of its points. Veda is about realizing self. Vedic deit=\r\nies such as Agni, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Aswins, Brihaspati etc are slightly=\r\n different aspects of Aatman. Veda describes various aspects of the state o=\r\nf self-realization. That is why it is considered the highest knowledge. Oth=\r\ner allied subjects throw some light on possible ways to reach that state. W=\r\nhile definitive and absolute statements can be made on the actual state of =\r\nself-realization itself, no definitive statements can be made on how to rea=\r\nch it. Only relative statements can be made based on desa-kaala-paatra. The=\r\n path depends on one&#39;s current position!\n\nGreat men in many spiritual paths=\r\n, within Hinduism as well as outside of it, came, experienced that state, u=\r\nnderstood the current state of people around them and gave specific instruc=\r\ntions on how to reach that state from the current state. Some followed the =\r\ninstructions and experienced the state. Some instead kept arguing about the=\r\n contradictions between paths.\n\nStop Arguing and Do Sadhana\n\nAs the metapho=\r\nr above illustrates, arguments about various paths are irrelevant and distr=\r\nacting. What is important is to pick a path and follow it. Whether one does=\r\n a Vedic homam or an Aagamic homam is a secondary issue. The primary issues=\r\n are whether one does homam or not, how focused one is, how one=E2=80=99s f=\r\nocus is improving and how one is being transformed internally.\n\nJust as a t=\r\nwenty course meal eaten once every six months does not give much energy to =\r\none, a =E2=80=9Cbig=E2=80=9D homam or another ritual done once every six mo=\r\nnths or a year does not boost one=E2=80=99s spiritual or material pursuits.=\r\n Just as a small bowl of rice and lentil soup eaten everyday gives more ene=\r\nrgy to one, a small 20-30 minute homam done everyday gives a boost to one=\r\n=E2=80=99s spiritual evolution.\n\nWise Tradeoffs\n\nSuppose the president of t=\r\nhe country is visiting one for lunch with 100 associates. One can invite al=\r\nl the 100 associates of the President by name and seat them in the room ind=\r\nividually, following various protocols. Then one can exchange long pleasant=\r\nries with the President and then offer lunch.\n\nSuppose one is in a hurry an=\r\nd has very little time. If one still invites all the 100 associates by name=\r\n and seats them in the room individually following the protocol and does no=\r\nt have enough time to let the President eat lunch in the end, is it a wise =\r\ntradeoff? Or is it wiser to invite all the 100 associates together and seat=\r\n them together by violating the protocol and use that time to let the Presi=\r\ndent eat in peace?\n\nSimilarly, is it wise if one exchanges long pleasantrie=\r\ns and gives very little time to eat? Or should one cut short on the pleasan=\r\ntries and give more time to eat?\n\nIn a fire ritual, making offerings to the=\r\n main deity is the primary part. Various upacharas done to the deity before=\r\n the offerings commence is secondary. Various preliminary and final steps a=\r\nnd offerings to associate deities are tertiary. If one has a few hours for =\r\nthe fire ritual, one can do everything given in scriptures leisurely. If on=\r\ne has only 20-30 minutes, one needs to make wise tradeoffs and maximize the=\r\n benefit. It is far better than doing nothing.\n\n&lt;sections deleted&gt;\n\nProof o=\r\nf the Pudding\n\nAt this time, more than hundred people are doing a homam to =\r\nsome deity or the other, everyday. Spending time worshipping god in fire fo=\r\nr 20-30 min (or more) everyday, with an attitude of surrender and with some=\r\n basic intellectual understanding of the absolute truths expounded by Veda =\r\nand Upanishads, can do a world of good to one=E2=80=99s spiritual evolution=\r\n. The proof of the pudding is in eating it.

I humbly agree that jHora is not the right forum for discussing the=\r\nse topics.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have gone through the homam manual provided by Sri.Narasi=\r\nmhaji and the video of a homam being performed and have the following obser=\r\nvations to make.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. As per rules laid out by srouta and gruhya sutras =\r\nwhich describe the preocedures for various rituals, any yajna (homam) can o=\r\nnly be a vikruti of the darsapoornamasa (which is the prakruti of all yajna=\r\ns).\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. All steps in darsapoornamasa should be there in the homam proce=\r\ndure (some exist in tooshnee or amantraka form, but it has to be there). We=\r\n are nobody to judge which are essential and which are not essential. They =\r\nare laid down by vedas and later elaborated by acharyas.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. There are =\r\nvariations in procedures in the different sutras such as apastamba sutra, b=\r\nohayana sutra, asvalayana sutra etc., but no omissions.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. The ordinar=\r\ny materials such as fire wood, grains, ghee etc. become worthy of divine us=\r\nage only when they are divinised using the right procedure. Then only it be=\r\ncomes a divine procedure. Otherwise it is only a &quot;fire ritual&quot; as named. I =\r\nsuggest reading of the volumnous work &quot;Agni&quot; by Frits Staal to get a insigh=\r\nt into the importance of these steps.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5. The procedure in the manual i=\r\ns not as laid out by any of the sutras. There are large deviations and omis=\r\nsions. It looks like a mix of vedic and tantrik procedures. \n&gt; \n&gt; 6. In par=\r\nistarana or laying the darbha aorund the kunda there is a particular manner=\r\n in which the tips of succeeding darbhas are tucked under the bottom of the=\r\n prceeding ones.\n&gt; \n&gt; 7. The direction for sprinkling water (mantra parishk=\r\nekam) with the mantra &quot;deva savita prasuva&quot; ie:- #4 is shown to be from SE =\r\ncorner to NE corner. This can not be because apasavya is for pitru karyas. =\r\nIt is in a circle starting from NE corner and ending at NE corner (Eshaadi =\r\neeshaantam).\n&gt; \n&gt; 8 Patraasadanam or keeping the vessels and ladles used in=\r\n the vessel above darbha is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 9.Prokshanee samskaram and proksh=\r\nanam for purification of the utensils is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 10. Patra samskaram =\r\nor purifying the utensils is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 11. Praneeta samskaram, varuna a=\r\nvahanam on praneeta, varuna poojanam and aacchadanam (covering of praneeta =\r\nwith darbha) is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 12. Brahma varanam ( at least a koorcha brahm=\r\na) is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 13. Ajya samskaram or purification of the ghee and pary=\r\nagnikaranam of the homa dravya used for havan is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 14. Darvee s=\r\namskaram or purification of ladles used in the homam is missing. Always to =\r\nspoons are to be used (sruksruvou).\n&gt; \n&gt; 15. Placement of paridhi and aagha=\r\nrasamit is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 16. Idhma pradanam or placement of a fixed number =\r\nof samits in the agni iis missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 17. It is seen in the video that wi=\r\nth a single dip of the ladle in the ghee, multiple ahutis are given in drop=\r\ns. There is fixed quantity of ghee to be given in each ahuti. Otherwise it =\r\nwill lead to dravyalopa.\n&gt; \n&gt; and many more ............\n&gt; \n&gt; 18. Strictly =\r\nspeaking, in the vedic procedure the deity is not invoked into agni. Agni a=\r\nlone exists in the kunda and he acts as carrier for the other gods (havya v=\r\nahaka). Depending on the name of deity pronounced in satva tyaga, agni carr=\r\nies the offering to the particular deity. If at all deity is invoked it is =\r\ngaunam (secondary or not necessary)\n&gt; \n&gt; 18. In the tantrik procedure, the =\r\ndeity is invoked into the kunda and the agni acts either as the jadharagni =\r\nof the deity or the agni itself is converted into the deity (agnyatmaka) by=\r\n offering the specified agni devata aikya ahutis.\n&gt; \n&gt; 19. Very good altern=\r\nate homa procedures are available in the mantra sastra (refer Mantra maharn=\r\nava for example) ideal for sadhakas. They don&#39;t involve veda mantras so tha=\r\nt you don&#39;t have to struggle to get the right pronunciation and svaras. The=\r\nse procedures are designed for mantra sadhakas who perform homam on their o=\r\nwn. They can be easily adapted to perfrom homam for any devata.\n&gt; \n&gt; 20. Ho=\r\nmam should not be seen as a 20 minute Jane Fonda work out that can be learn=\r\ned from a video. It involves learning from an able guru and practice with d=\r\nevotion, precision and perfection.\n&gt; \n&gt; 21. I suggest that we preserve each=\r\n branch of knowledge in its own purity. Hybrids may not always yield good r=\r\nesults. Let almighty help to preserve knowledge uncorrupted.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-343980341-1277026148=:78411\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Dear Narasimhaji,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks for your reply.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;1. &quot;There are ma=\r\nny standard homam procedures in the world today, some more elaborate than w=\r\nhat we teach and some more brief. &quot; - &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Please =\r\nclarify whether the homa procedure taught by you belongs to the vedic syste=\r\nm. If so, which authoritative text have you relied upon? Or is it one desig=\r\nned by yourself keeping the convenience factor in mind ?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;There are many procedures even within the vedic system for perfo=\r\nrming homam. Each established procedure given by acharyas&nbsp; is complete=\r\n&nbsp;in itself and do not violate the fundamental principles of vedic ritu=\r\nals.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;It will be interesting here to point out =\r\nthat when some sections of samavedis when they perform sraadham&nbsp;do the=\r\n&nbsp;hormam on the palm of the bhokta brahmin. It is called panihomam. Eve=\r\nn the fire is not present there. It is based on a dictum called &quot; brahmanas=\r\nya dakshine haste hotavyam&quot; - the homa is to be performed on the right hand=\r\n of the brahmin. It is believed that agni is ever present in the right hand=\r\n of the srotriya (one learned in the veda) brahmin. There is no defect here=\r\n. It is as per sastra. Now if you modify this and say that homa can be perf=\r\nromed on the right glove worn by a brahmin, then the problem arises.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;As you have said, any system of worship is acceptabl=\r\ne. There are so many religions and cults all around the world. Nobody objec=\r\nts. If you call something vedic, please make sure that it conforms to the v=\r\nedic tenets.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Homam is a ritualistic form of wo=\r\nrship and if you bring in advaita vada in it it doesn&#39;t work.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;It is not a question of whether it is more elaborate or les=\r\ns elaborate or which is inferior or which is superior. It is a question of =\r\nwhether it is correct and based on what vedic authority. If you are promoti=\r\nng this homa procedure as one of your own design, there is no objection. On=\r\n the contrary, if you need the sanction of vedic authority for it, please&n=\r\nbsp;answer within the ambit of vedic knowledge&nbsp;if doubts are raised.&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The apprehension is that in the year 2000 you s=\r\naid,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DTimes-Roman&gt;\n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;&quot;I ca=\r\nnnot possibly finish this preface without expressing my deep gratitude for =\r\nmy \n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;guru Pt. Sanjay Rath, who has been a constant source of=\r\n enlightenment, \n&lt;DIV&gt;encouragement and inspiration. I am eternally gratefu=\r\nl to him&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;and now you say&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;In my well-considered view, Sanjay ji got some specific secrets a=\r\nnd some generic guidelines (which may be imperfect, like with all other par=\r\namparas) from his elders. He then read some books and formed his understand=\r\ning. As he started teaching it, he received a lot of adulation for the &quot;par=\r\nampara secrets&quot;. I am afraid he got addicted to the adulation and started t=\r\no manufacture &quot;parampara secrets&quot; after the initial run. Slowly he became c=\r\nommercial and he started selling manufactured &quot;parampara knowledge&quot;.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Yes, his teachings contain fascinating philosophizat=\r\nion, which is really superficial and does not stand any real scrutiny. His =\r\ntheories are like beautiful structures built with a pack of cards. Sanjay j=\r\ni always maintains an air of &quot;I know more, but will teach later&quot;. It is con=\r\nvenient to give the impression that there is more. If anything does not mak=\r\ne sense, it could be because you have to learn more!&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;As he started exploiting and commercializing half-baked and ill-conc=\r\neived knowledge in the name of a parampara, I took an exception to the comm=\r\nercialization and dishonesty. After expressing my reservations privately an=\r\nd having no effect, I started to go public, first subtly and later bluntly.=\r\n After several clashes, I was kicked out of SJC.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;With basic concepts like houses, arudha padas, chara karakas, argalas et=\r\nc, the generic guidelines he received are imperfect. He deviates from Paras=\r\nara in several matters and his teachings do not work consistently.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Bottomline: Sanjay ji&#39;s base is made of some specific =\r\nsecrets (that are imperfect) and some generic guidelines (that are imperfec=\r\nt too). Starting from that base and reading books, he hastily created a bod=\r\ny of knowledge which he sells now. If there is anything in his teachings th=\r\nat can be used relatively reliably, it is TP.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;In 2000 you said&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DTimes-Roman&gt;\n&lt;P=\r\n align=3Dleft&gt;&quot;Narayana dasa is a very important rasi dasa. It is a phalita=\r\n dasa. It shows general&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;results. Narayana dasa is com=\r\nputed differently for different divisional charts and we&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;P align=3Dl=\r\neft&gt;can use Narayana dasa of a divisional chart to predict matters related =\r\nto that&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;divisional chart.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;Narayana dasa is based on the progression of lagna =\r\nin one=E2=80=99s life. As one dasa ends&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;and another s=\r\ntarts, one rasi stops being the progressed lagna and another rasi&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;P =\r\nalign=3Dleft&gt;becomes one=E2=80=99s progressed lagna. Using the progressed l=\r\nagna as the reference, we&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;find out the events that ha=\r\nppen in that dasa. Thus we get twelve charts for each&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;P align=3Dleft=\r\n&gt;person, with each chart applicable in one dasa.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;This is a very versatile dasa system and readers s=\r\nould pay attention to the details of&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;calculation.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;now you say&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;Nara=\r\nyana dasa may be based on some genuine parampara knowledge, but it does not=\r\n work with any level of consistency. I am afraid it needs refinement.&quot;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;You seem to start teaching even before you&nbsp;st=\r\nart learning.&nbsp;I&#39; m only afraid it should not happen in the context of =\r\nvedic rituals also. From the pronunciation &nbsp;of the person who is perfo=\r\nrming the homam in the video, it is quite obvious that he is at an entry le=\r\nvel.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;If you agree that you are not trying to p=\r\nropagate vedic knowledge, I have no more points&nbsp; to make.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;2. &quot;What I teach is ON=\r\nE procedure for those who do not know any.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Ar=\r\ne there different ways you teach a person to fly an aeroplane depending on =\r\nwhat he knows and what he does ?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;3. &quot;Knowledge=\r\n of *external rituals* is relative and can never be absolute.

There are many st=\r\nandard homam procedures in the world today, some more elaborate than what w=\r\ne teach and some more brief. I do not care exactly what procedure one uses =\r\nand I will be happy if more and more people do homam *regularly*, irrespect=\r\nive of the exact procedure used! What I teach is ONE procedure for those wh=\r\no do not know any. If you are initiated into a different procedure that you=\r\n can do daily, please go ahead and do it daily the way you know it. That wi=\r\nll make us very happy. However, if the method you know cannot be done daily=\r\n, please consider what I taught, which is simple enough to do daily.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Suppose there are rules and protocols on how one should serve=\r\n lunch to one&#39;s parents, e.g. how to place the plates, spoons, forks, soup =\r\nbowls, drink cups, dessert bowls etc and how and in what order to serve var=\r\nious items in those containers. Suppose the protocol is so complex that one=\r\n cannot\n do it everyday and calls one&#39;s parents for a lunch once every few =\r\nmonths.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Is that better or is it better to relax the rules and protoc=\r\nols to make it less formal and serve lunch to parents everyday?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * =\r\n*&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 21.

There is nothing imp=\r\nure or corrupt about it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At the end of the day, the key is whether o=\r\nne is actually doing some sadhana on a regular basis or not, whether it is =\r\ncausing internal transformation in one or not, and whether it helps in one&#39;=\r\ns\n spiritual progress or not.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Let me cut &amp; paste a =\r\nsection from a writeup I wrote for an upcoming occasion. It contains an ana=\r\nlogy given earlier and addresses some relevant issues.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;-------------=\r\n----------------&lt;BR&gt;Do Vedas Describe External Rituals&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some people b=\r\nelieve that Veda describes the specifics about various external yagyas. Ved=\r\na is supposed to be absolute, timeless and uncreated knowledge that is not =\r\nbound by desa-kaala-paatra. How can descriptions of specific external ritua=\r\nls be unbound by desa-kaala-paatra?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Though Sayanacharya=E2=80=99s ce=\r\nlebrated commentary on RigVeda is ritualistic in nature, Aurobindo Ghose ha=\r\nd a different take in his =E2=80=9CSecret of the Veda=E2=80=9D. His view is=\r\n that Veda talks about absolute truths about the inner self and not relativ=\r\ne truths about external matters. Agni or Fire symbolizes the divine Will. T=\r\nhat is why it is the immortal in mortals. Its rhythm will devour everything=\r\n that is\n perishable and purify all. While fire in a fire ritual symbolizes=\r\n the divine Will, various offerings in it symbolize various aspects of one=\r\n=E2=80=99s conditioning and the smoke symbolizes one=E2=80=99s passions and=\r\n desires.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Metaphor: Vedic Homam vs Aagamic Homam&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Notions that=\r\n so and so yagya ritual is sanctioned by Veda and so and so aagamic/tantric=\r\n yagya ritual is not sanctioned by Veda can be put in perspective using a m=\r\netaphor.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Once there were many people who lived near the sea [Aatman]=\r\n. They regularly sat by the sea and enjoyed the sight and sound of the sea =\r\n[absorbed in Aatman most of the time]. They described the sea in some nice =\r\ncryptic poems [Veda].&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As people started living a little away from th=\r\ne sea [less spiritually evolved], someone had to put together some instruct=\r\nions on how to reach the sea. He said, &quot;keep walking towards east&quot; and the =\r\ninstructions grew with time. People faithfully followed the instructions\n [=\r\nrituals].&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;People started moving further and further inland and start=\r\ned living in a landlocked desert far away from the sea. This generation had=\r\n never seen a pool of water like a lake, let alone a sea. They faithfully p=\r\nerformed the ritual of walking towards east, but did not find sea. They deb=\r\nated endlessly whether one had to walk one mile or two miles or three miles=\r\n and formed different schools of thought. Some walked their chosen distance=\r\n, found a tree or a building or some interesting object and even became sat=\r\nisfied that that was sea!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Then came some great person, whose instinc=\r\nts led him to take a horse instead of walking and ride it for a long distan=\r\nce [use of other tools]. He did find the sea after a few months. He put tog=\r\nether newer instructions to reach the sea, which included riding a horse [n=\r\new =C3=A4gama and tantra].&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;People performing the old rituals objecte=\r\nd to this and said &quot;but then this horse thing is not granted by the\n book o=\r\nf sea. This is a new path and different from the &quot;pure&quot; sea ritual&quot; [pure V=\r\nedic ritual]. By now, people did not even understand what the cryptic poems=\r\n of the original &quot;book of sea&quot; mean, but they simply believed that those po=\r\nems taught the old &quot;pure&quot; sea rituals that they were used to. They were bli=\r\nssfully unaware that the original instructions were meant for someone alrea=\r\ndy close to sea and the newer instructions came from someone who actually s=\r\naw the sea and knew where they currently lived and how to get to the sea fr=\r\nom there!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Slowly many new sets of instructions involving horses, cha=\r\nriots etc were taught and many new paths to the sea were outlined instead o=\r\nf just instructing people to walk towards east [evolution of mantra/tantra/=\r\nyantras].&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One particular path through jungles was dangerous [aghora =\r\nand other dark tantric paths involving practice of sex, meat, wine etc]. Th=\r\nough the distance to sea was much shorter through that\n jungle, it was just=\r\n too dangerous and only the bravest and strongest could make it. There were=\r\n cruel dacoits and wild animals [chance of a fall in a risky ritual] and ma=\r\nny weak people travelling to sea via that path were killed. A wise man who =\r\nknew the entire territory well came forward, condemned that path and discou=\r\nraged people from trying that path. Since then, even people who were strong=\r\n enough to successfully make it in that path desisted from it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As ti=\r\nme progressed, people started fighting too much about whose path was superi=\r\nor. They were foolish, not smart enough to adopt the original instructions,=\r\n of either the so-called &quot;pure&quot; sea path or the so-called &quot;new&quot; path or oth=\r\ner variations, for the changed geography and changed times. Many followed t=\r\nhe instructions blindly, hit roadblocks and did not reach sea. Many did not=\r\n even know that &quot;reaching the sea&quot; was the actual goal of all their joirney=\r\ns. They only thought they were supposed to\n follow the instructions faithfu=\r\nlly and there was no need to adopt to the changed geographical territory an=\r\nd time. They even condemned those who actually went to sea, came back and g=\r\nave updated directions for their place and time, for violating tradition.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In case the analogy is not clear, here is a brief summary of its poin=\r\nts. Veda is about realizing self. Vedic deities such as Agni, Indra, Mitra,=\r\n Varuna, Aswins, Brihaspati etc are slightly different aspects of Aatman. V=\r\neda describes various aspects of the state of self-realization. That is why=\r\n it is considered the highest knowledge. Other allied subjects throw some l=\r\night on possible ways to reach that state. While definitive and absolute st=\r\natements can be made on the actual state of self-realization itself, no def=\r\ninitive statements can be made on how to reach it. Only relative statements=\r\n can be made based on desa-kaala-paatra. The path depends on one&#39;s current =\r\nposition!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Great men in many\n spiritual paths, within Hinduism as wel=\r\nl as outside of it, came, experienced that state, understood the current st=\r\nate of people around them and gave specific instructions on how to reach th=\r\nat state from the current state. Some followed the instructions and experie=\r\nnced the state. Some instead kept arguing about the contradictions between =\r\npaths.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Stop Arguing and Do Sadhana&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As the metaphor above illu=\r\nstrates, arguments about various paths are irrelevant and distracting. What=\r\n is important is to pick a path and follow it. Whether one does a Vedic hom=\r\nam or an Aagamic homam is a secondary issue. The primary issues are whether=\r\n one does homam or not, how focused one is, how one=E2=80=99s focus is impr=\r\noving and how one is being transformed internally.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just as a twenty =\r\ncourse meal eaten once every six months does not give much energy to one, a=\r\n =E2=80=9Cbig=E2=80=9D homam or another ritual done once every six months o=\r\nr a year does not boost one=E2=80=99s spiritual or\n material pursuits. Just=\r\n as a small bowl of rice and lentil soup eaten everyday gives more energy t=\r\no one, a small 20-30 minute homam done everyday gives a boost to one=E2=80=\r\n=99s spiritual evolution.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Wise Tradeoffs&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Suppose the presiden=\r\nt of the country is visiting one for lunch with 100 associates. One can inv=\r\nite all the 100 associates of the President by name and seat them in the ro=\r\nom individually, following various protocols. Then one can exchange long pl=\r\neasantries with the President and then offer lunch.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Suppose one is i=\r\nn a hurry and has very little time. If one still invites all the 100 associ=\r\nates by name and seats them in the room individually following the protocol=\r\n and does not have enough time to let the President eat lunch in the end, i=\r\ns it a wise tradeoff? Or is it wiser to invite all the 100 associates toget=\r\nher and seat them together by violating the protocol and use that time to l=\r\net the President eat in peace?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Similarly, is\n it wise if one exchang=\r\nes long pleasantries and gives very little time to eat? Or should one cut s=\r\nhort on the pleasantries and give more time to eat?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In a fire ritual=\r\n, making offerings to the main deity is the primary part. Various upacharas=\r\n done to the deity before the offerings commence is secondary. Various prel=\r\niminary and final steps and offerings to associate deities are tertiary. If=\r\n one has a few hours for the fire ritual, one can do everything given in sc=\r\nriptures leisurely. If one has only 20-30 minutes, one needs to make wise t=\r\nradeoffs and maximize the benefit. It is far better than doing nothing.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;sections deleted&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Proof of the Pudding&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At this tim=\r\ne, more than hundred people are doing a homam to some deity or the other, e=\r\nveryday. Spending time worshipping god in fire for 20-30 min (or more) ever=\r\nyday, with an attitude of surrender and with some basic intellectual unders=\r\ntanding of the absolute truths expounded by\n Veda and Upanishads, can do a =\r\nworld of good to one=E2=80=99s spiritual evolution. The proof of the puddin=\r\ng is in eating it. One can try to perform a short homam everyday for a few =\r\nmonths and see for oneself if there is a difference in one=E2=80=99s attitu=\r\nde, focus and clarity of thinking.&lt;BR&gt;-----------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nBest regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;---------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writi=\r\nngs,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_bla=\r\nnk&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Films that make a difference: &lt;A h=\r\nref=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://Sa=\r\nraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/gr=\r\noup/vedic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gr=\r\noup/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jyotish writings: &lt;A\n href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/JyotishWritings&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----------------------------------------=\r\n------------------&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---- moulamagamagguru &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.mc=\r\n951.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dmoulamagamagguru%40yahoo.in&quot; rel=3Dnofol=\r\nlow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:moulamagamagguru%40yahoo.in&quot;&gt;moulamag=\r\namagguru@...&lt;/A&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear Members,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; At=\r\n the outset, thanks to Shri.Rajarshy Nandy for guiding me into this forum. =\r\nI had posted a message in jHora in response to a forward from Jyotishwritin=\r\ngs on &quot;efficacy of remedies&quot;. I humbly agree that jHora is not the right fo=\r\nrum for discussing these topics.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I have gone through the h=\r\nomam manual provided by Sri.Narasimhaji and the video of a homam being perf=\r\normed and have the following observations to make.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1. As p=\r\ner rules laid out by srouta and gruhya sutras which\n describe the preocedur=\r\nes for various rituals, any yajna (homam) can only be a vikruti of the dars=\r\napoornamasa (which is the prakruti of all yajnas).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2. All =\r\nsteps in darsapoornamasa should be there in the homam procedure (some exist=\r\n in tooshnee or amantraka form, but it has to be there). We are nobody to j=\r\nudge which are essential and which are not essential. They are laid down by=\r\n vedas and later elaborated by acharyas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 3. There are vari=\r\nations in procedures in the different sutras such as apastamba sutra, bohay=\r\nana sutra, asvalayana sutra etc., but no omissions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 4. The=\r\n ordinary materials such as fire wood, grains, ghee etc. become worthy of d=\r\nivine usage only when they are divinised using the right procedure. Then on=\r\nly it becomes a divine procedure. Otherwise it is only a &quot;fire ritual&quot; as n=\r\named. I suggest reading of the volumnous work &quot;Agni&quot; by Frits Staal to get =\r\na insight into the importance of these\n steps.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 5. The proc=\r\nedure in the manual is not as laid out by any of the sutras. There are larg=\r\ne deviations and omissions. It looks like a mix of vedic and tantrik proced=\r\nures. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 6. In paristarana or laying the darbha aorund the k=\r\nunda there is a particular manner in which the tips of succeeding darbhas a=\r\nre tucked under the bottom of the prceeding ones.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 7. The d=\r\nirection for sprinkling water (mantra parishkekam) with the mantra &quot;deva sa=\r\nvita prasuva&quot; ie:- #4 is shown to be from SE corner to NE corner. This can =\r\nnot be because apasavya is for pitru karyas. It is in a circle starting fro=\r\nm NE corner and ending at NE corner (Eshaadi eeshaantam).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n8 Patraasadanam or keeping the vessels and ladles used in the vessel above =\r\ndarbha is missing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 9.Prokshanee samskaram and prokshanam f=\r\nor purification of the utensils is missing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 10. Patra sams=\r\nkaram or purifying the utensils\n is missing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 11. Praneeta =\r\nsamskaram, varuna avahanam on praneeta, varuna poojanam and aacchadanam (co=\r\nvering of praneeta with darbha) is missing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 12. Brahma var=\r\nanam ( at least a koorcha brahma) is missing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 13. Ajya sam=\r\nskaram or purification of the ghee and paryagnikaranam of the homa dravya u=\r\nsed for havan is missing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 14. Darvee samskaram or purifica=\r\ntion of ladles used in the homam is missing. Always to spoons are to be use=\r\nd (sruksruvou).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 15. Placement of paridhi and aagharasamit =\r\nis missing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 16. Idhma pradanam or placement of a fixed num=\r\nber of samits in the agni iis missing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 17. It is seen in t=\r\nhe video that with a single dip of the ladle in the ghee, multiple ahutis a=\r\nre given in drops. There is fixed quantity of ghee to be given in each ahut=\r\ni. Otherwise it will lead to dravyalopa.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and many more ...=\r\n.........&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 18. Strictly speaking, in the vedic procedure t=\r\nhe deity is not invoked into agni. Agni alone exists in the kunda and he ac=\r\nts as carrier for the other gods (havya vahaka). Depending on the name of d=\r\neity pronounced in satva tyaga, agni carries the offering to the particular=\r\n deity. If at all deity is invoked it is gaunam (secondary or not necessary=\r\n)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 18. In the tantrik procedure, the deity is invoked into =\r\nthe kunda and the agni acts either as the jadharagni of the deity or the ag=\r\nni itself is converted into the deity (agnyatmaka) by offering the specifie=\r\nd agni devata aikya ahutis.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 19. Very good alternate homa p=\r\nrocedures are available in the mantra sastra (refer Mantra maharnava for ex=\r\nample) ideal for sadhakas. They don&#39;t involve veda mantras so that you don&#39;=\r\nt have to struggle to get the right pronunciation and svaras. These procedu=\r\nres are designed for mantra sadhakas who perform homam on their own. They c=\r\nan be\n easily adapted to perfrom homam for any devata.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 20.=\r\n Homam should not be seen as a 20 minute Jane Fonda work out that can be le=\r\narned from a video. It involves learning from an able guru and practice wit=\r\nh devotion, precision and perfection.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 21. I suggest that w=\r\ne preserve each branch of knowledge in its own purity. Hybrids may not alwa=\r\nys yield good results. Let almighty help to preserve knowledge uncorrupted.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n--0-343980341-1277026148=:78411--\r\n\n"}}
