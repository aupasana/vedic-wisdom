But a jeevanmukta is free and unbound even while \n&gt; operating wi=\r\nth an identity, for binding comes from the conditioning and \n&gt; not from ide=\r\nntification or actions. When the identity dissolves, it is \n&gt; not any bette=\r\nr or any extra freedom.\n&gt; \n&gt; Most likely, a jeevanmukta ceases to operate a=\r\nn identity after some \n&gt; time, that time depending on the strength of prior=\r\n momentum! It can be \n&gt; days or months or years or centuries or millennia.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Nature sets such powerful momentum in place for some beings (e.g. \n&gt; s=\r\naptarshis, Vishnu, Shiva etc) that they may operate an identity for a \n&gt; ve=\r\nry long time after conditioning drops off completely.

But, because there is no conditioning and hence no age=\r\nndas, no \n&gt; &gt; desires, no likes and dislikes, one neither rejoices nor prot=\r\nests nor \n&gt; &gt; tries to modify the happenings to what one is identifying wit=\r\nh.\n&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 *=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; Sens=\r\ning that there is a pain requires no conditioning.

It is t=\r\nhe function of buddhi, i.e. Budha. But thinking \n&gt; &gt; of praying to god to r=\r\neduce pain requires conditioning in chitta \n&gt; &gt; (absent in a jeevanmukta!).=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Though a jeevanmukta is identifying with a body, one does not view it =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; as something his own and something that must be kept in a particular \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; state.

I await your reply.\n&gt; &gt; Kindest regards\n&gt; &gt; On Sunday, February 19, 20=\r\n12, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt; pvr@ \n&gt; &gt; &lt;javascript:parent.wgMail.openComposeWind=\r\now(&#39;pvr@&#39;)&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Namaste, As twitter is too restrictive a medium, =\r\nI want to answer a \n&gt; &gt;&gt; question that came up in an exchange between my gu=\r\nru Manish and me on \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Twitter, here. Some portions of the Twitter excha=\r\nnge are quoted at \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the end, in chronological order, in case someone is=\r\n interested in the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; background. I will answer the following question p=\r\nosed by Manish \n&gt; &gt;&gt; based on my understanding: &lt;&lt;&lt;The question to my mind =\r\nis this: was \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Ramakrishna a Jeevanmukta? If so, Why did he suffer with=\r\n throat \n&gt; &gt;&gt; cancer if he was not identifying with his actions? (according=\r\n to your \n&gt; &gt;&gt; interpretation of Vasistha&#39;s definition??)&gt;&gt;&gt; * =C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A * =C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A * Let me elaborate on my understanding of jeevanmukti. Manish \n&gt; &gt;&gt; loo=\r\nsely (in my view) said in this exchange that rinas are of body and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; a =\r\njeevanmukta continues to fulfil those rinas. But body is an \n&gt; &gt;&gt; insentien=\r\nt object. It has no rinas. The rinas are not of the body, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; but of the =\r\nmind that identifies with it. It is the antahkaranas of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; mind - ahamka=\r\nra (I-ness) and chitta (memory/conditioning) - that are \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the source of=\r\n various rinas, particularly chitta. As mind identifies \n&gt; &gt;&gt; with a body, =\r\nit projects its rinas on the body and makes the body \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;experience&quot; and=\r\n &quot;do&quot; things, in accordance with those \n&gt; &gt;&gt; rinas/conditioning. If the con=\r\nditioning in chitta is completely wiped \n&gt; &gt;&gt; out and ahamkara merges in Se=\r\nlf, then it is mukti. But, if the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta is completel=\r\ny wiped out and yet ahamkara \n&gt; &gt;&gt; continues to exist with no limiting noti=\r\nons (it is basically the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta that is limiting), th=\r\nen one becomes \n&gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta (liberated while living). Unlike in the ca=\r\nse of one who \n&gt; &gt;&gt; leaves body and gets mukti, a jeevanmukta continues to =\r\nhave an I-ness \n&gt; &gt;&gt; (but which is not limited by any notions or conditioni=\r\nng). This \n&gt; &gt;&gt; unconditioned I-ness does project into a body. But it does =\r\nnot say &quot;I \n&gt; &gt;&gt; am this body and hence this body should be kept healthy or=\r\n strong&quot; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; (THAT would be conditioning in chitta, which is wiped out no=\r\nw!). On \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the other hand, it does not either say &quot;this body should be i=\r\ngnored \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and destroyed&quot;. Though conditioning is absent now, body keeps =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; experiencing and doing things based on the *momentum* set in motion \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; before one became jeevanmukta and engaged in conditioned experiences \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and actions. This is like a fan turning for a while after the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; el=\r\nectricity has been stopped. Manas, buddhi and indriyas keep working \n&gt; &gt;&gt; a=\r\ns they did before. If one has throat cancer, indriyas may sense \n&gt; &gt;&gt; pain.=\r\n Manas (sensory/motor mind) may process that input and register \n&gt; &gt;&gt; pain.=\r\n Buddhi may analyze various observations and draw various \n&gt; &gt;&gt; conclusions=\r\n (e.g. &quot;when I gulp or try to swallow food, it hurts even \n&gt; &gt;&gt; more&quot;, &quot;whe=\r\nn I take so and so herbal liquid, it feels better&quot; etc). A \n&gt; &gt;&gt; normal per=\r\nson whose conditioned mind (chitta) says &quot;I should overcome \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and not h=\r\nave this pain&quot; may think of various things to do and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; struggle with th=\r\nem. But an unconditioned being has no such \n&gt; &gt;&gt; considerations. Though one=\r\n may feel and express the pain and other \n&gt; &gt;&gt; objective experiences, one r=\r\neacts to it differently. * =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A * =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=\r\n=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A * This is a key point: Manas a=\r\nnd buddhi are good at making \n&gt; &gt;&gt; objective observations and rational dedu=\r\nctions, but, by themselves, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; they do not have ANY agenda. They neither=\r\n like something nor dislike \n&gt; &gt;&gt; something. THAT comes from the conditioni=\r\nng in chitta! The hallmark \n&gt; &gt;&gt; of a jeevanmukta is that THAT is absent! *=\r\n =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A * =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=\r\n=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A * \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Whether Ramakrishna was a jeevanmukta is a moot=\r\n question. A better \n&gt; &gt;&gt; way to express your question is: Can a jeevanmukt=\r\na get throat cancer \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and feel pain? How is it possible if there are no=\r\n karmas or rinas \n&gt; &gt;&gt; left? I have already answered it. But, let me sum it=\r\n up briefly \n&gt; &gt;&gt; again. Body, various body parts, jnanendriyas, karmendiya=\r\ns, manas and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; buddhi of a jeevanmukta continue to operate as before. O=\r\nne&#39;s I-ness \n&gt; &gt;&gt; is intact and does project itself onto those. But neither=\r\n I-ness nor \n&gt; &gt;&gt; those things carry any rinas or karmas. Chitta - the repo=\r\nsitory of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning and rinas - is clean. There are no limiting no=\r\ntions. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; One&#39;s body, indriyas, manas & buddhi keep experiencing and doi=\r\nng \n&gt; &gt;&gt; things (good or bad!) based on the previous momentum set by the pl=\r\nay \n&gt; &gt;&gt; of rnas and karmas while some conditioning was left in chitta. Bod=\r\ny, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; various body parts, indriyas of jnana and karma and manas are all =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; portions borrowed from various deities. Ahamkara (I-ness) infuses \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; sentience into them by projecting awareness into them. The \n&gt; &gt;&gt; conditi=\r\noning in chitta is what drives how all these are viewed and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; used. Ins=\r\ntead of looking at a sense organ as a portion of Indra or \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Mitra, one =\r\nviews it as &quot;my so and so sense organ&quot;, due to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta=\r\n. That is what creates karmas and rinas. When \n&gt; &gt;&gt; that conditioning is *c=\r\nompletely* overcome, ahamkara can still \n&gt; &gt;&gt; project awareness into those =\r\nobjects, but it sees them for what they \n&gt; &gt;&gt; are. It does not have false a=\r\nnd limiting notions like &quot;this throat is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; mine and MUST feel nice and =\r\nnot feel painful&quot;. * =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A * =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A * Most people who may claim to be (or=\r\n think they are) jeevanmuktas \n&gt; &gt;&gt; are not really jeevanmuktas in today&#39;s =\r\nworld. If one wants to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; understand the state of jeevanmukti, Yoga Vaas=\r\nishtham is the best \n&gt; &gt;&gt; book. The entire discourse by Maharshi Vasishtha =\r\nto Lord Rama is a \n&gt; &gt;&gt; detailed and elaborate definition and characterizat=\r\nion of a \n&gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta. There may be other books that explain better ho=\r\nw to do \n&gt; &gt;&gt; various sadhanas to progress spiritually and get closer to be=\r\ning \n&gt; &gt;&gt; liberated oneday. But, when it comes elaborating what liberation =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; while living actually is, there is none better than Yoga Vaasishtham.=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, one can say that this is merely an intellectual exercise =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; as far as *we* are concerned. It perhaps is, as none of may ever \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; become a jeevanmukta.. One word of caution: I write with a very \n&gt; &gt;&gt; con=\r\nfident tone when I have strong conviction in what I write. That is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; ho=\r\nw I am. But I can definitely be wrong. So please feel free to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; ignore =\r\nme! :-) Happy Shivaratri (tomorrow night) to all!

Nothing really, fulfilling all r=\r\nnas, wait for \n&gt; &gt;&gt; rnas to be over. Narasimha: If a &quot;jeevanmukta&quot; fails in=\r\n &quot;fulfilling \n&gt; &gt;&gt; all rnas&quot;, will he b bound again? If no, y r they called=\r\n rnas? If \n&gt; &gt;&gt; yes, y call him mukta? Manish: No, rnas will work out thems=\r\nelves, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; slowly or fast as may be the case. The rnas are of the body he=\r\n or she \n&gt; &gt;&gt; occupies. He is mukta because he experiences, actually sees t=\r\nhe rnas \n&gt; &gt;&gt; to be the body&#39;s only. Rnas apply to the body, not to you. Yo=\r\nu are \n&gt; &gt;&gt; that &quot;speck of effulgent light&quot;, call it what you want, Atma, e=\r\ntc. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: Well, that speck of effulgent light was never bound. S=\r\no, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; who exactly bcame &quot;mukta&quot;? Did & does he/it have rnas? If these &quot;r=\r\nnas \n&gt; &gt;&gt; of body&quot; r somehow not fulfilled after one bcomes jeevanmukta, wh=\r\nat \n&gt; &gt;&gt; happens to one? :-) Manish: You are right. The mind thought, that,=\r\n it \n&gt; &gt;&gt; was the body, instead of this light. That is the original problem=\r\n. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Which every being is born with. Rnas arise from this identification=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; which creates karma. U r not that, so u r not bound, when the mind \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; realises this. Became &quot;Mukta&quot; is also not quite true, since u r that \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Light&quot; frm d beginning Narasimha: Then, r the rnas of the &quot;body&quot; as \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; u said r of the mind? When a mind identifies with light & bcomes \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n mukta, does it hv rnas left? Manish: Ok, karmas projected into mind, \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n are acted on and may be experienced by body. So, why is a jeevanmukta \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; subject to this? because, that person although aware of the light at \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; all times, and of the causal n subtle bodies, has not yet directed d \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; mind to identify as that light at all times, key word being &quot;all&quot;. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nThis gives karmas time to work. Next stage is 24/7 id with light \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Nara=\r\nsimha: As per my understanding, the person u r defining is not a \n&gt; &gt;&gt; jeev=\r\nanmukta. He may b an elevated being, but not mukta (liberated) \n&gt; &gt;&gt; yet. M=\r\nanish: I derive that definition of this &quot;state&quot; from somebody, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; no pro=\r\nblem in disagreement. 24/7 identification with light, most \n&gt; &gt;&gt; likely bod=\r\ny should not exist, no? Narasimha: Id with light forever \n&gt; &gt;&gt; with body dr=\r\nopping off is just mukti, not jivanmukti! Jivanmukti is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; where body st=\r\nays. Is body really different from light? In fact, is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; there anything =\r\nother than light? Jivanmukti is seeing the play of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; objects but seeing=\r\n all as light. Mukti & rna are contradictory \n&gt; &gt;&gt; concepts & cant coexist.=\r\n U rnt &quot;free&quot; till u pay back what u owe. And \n&gt; &gt;&gt; that means u dont owe a=\r\nnybody anything once u r truly free. Words \n&gt; &gt;&gt; like free, liberated & jiv=\r\nanmukta r often misused. Manish: Will \n&gt; &gt;&gt; explain a bit in detail sometim=\r\ne. Narasimha: OK. :-) But, as far as \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;explaining&quot; is concerned, Vasis=\r\nhtha explained as clearly & \n&gt; &gt;&gt; elaborately as any human being can ever h=\r\nope 2. Manish: The question \n&gt; &gt;&gt; to my mind is this: was Ramakrishna a Jee=\r\nvanmukta? If so, Why did he \n&gt; &gt;&gt; suffer with throat cancer if he was not i=\r\ndentifying with his actions? \n&gt; &gt;&gt; (according to your interpretation of Vas=\r\nistha&#39;s definition??) \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: Vasishtha didnt give a single defini=\r\ntion. His entire \n&gt; &gt;&gt; discourse 2 Rama is a definition of jeevanmukta!

One&#39;s experiences and actions are due to &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; the momentum set in motion by previously present conditioning. One &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; engages in them with no agendas, likes, dislikes, and attachments. Thu=\r\ns, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a jeevanmukta operates the previous identity till the momentum =\r\ncomes to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a screeching halt and then the body, senses, sensory mind=\r\n, buddhi etc &lt;BR&gt;&gt; are returned to the original sources from which they =\r\nwere borrowed and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; made sentient. But a jeevanmukta is free and unb=\r\nound even while &lt;BR&gt;&gt; operating with an identity, for binding comes from=\r\n the conditioning and &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n not from identification or actions. When th=\r\ne identity dissolves, it is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; not any better or any extra freedom.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Most likely, a jeevanmukta ceases to operate an identity af=\r\nter some &lt;BR&gt;&gt; time, that time depending on the strength of prior moment=\r\num! It can be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; days or months or years or centuries or millennia.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Nature sets such powerful momentum in place for some beings=\r\n (e.g. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; saptarshis, Vishnu, Shiva etc) that they may operate an ide=\r\nntity for a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; very long time after conditioning drops off completely=\r\n. It may even be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; for the entire duration of Creation. As a part of=\r\n the momentum set in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; motion previously, one may even direct a part=\r\n of one&#39;s ahamkara to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; identify with a newly created identity (e.g.=\r\n a new incarnation).

I wasn&#39;t perhaps clear enough. Obviously, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; these =\r\nare not easy ideas to communicate in vaikhari (external &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; commu=\r\nnication). I pray to Maharshi Vasishtha to imbibe something more &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; than vaikhari in the following words so that people can understand &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; better (not you Manish, the goal of answering your questions is &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; obviously not to impart any knowledge to YOU, but to perhaps b=\r\nenefit &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; some others who may be ready - now or in future).&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt;\n &gt; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; The problem is not identification. The problem is *conditioning* &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; (likes, dislikes, wants, agendas etc) that drives the identific=\r\nation &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and use of what one&#39;s ahamkara identifies with. If aham=\r\nkara &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (identification) evaporates when chitta (conditioning) i=\r\ns cleaned up, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; it is normal mukti. If ahamkara (identification=\r\n) remains while chitta &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (conditioning) is cleaned up, it is je=\r\nevanmukti. It is as simple as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; *&nbsp; &nbs=\r\np; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If one engages=\r\n in an action with zero conditioning, then there is no &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; karma =\r\nand there are no rinas created. Actions (physical or mental) by &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; themselves do not bind one - it is the&nbsp; *conditioned* actions that =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; bind one! It is the likes, dislikes, desires, agendas etc\n (i=\r\n.e. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; conditioning in chitta) behind an action that bind one!&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; If somebody who is not YET a jeevanmukta (but close) identified w=\r\nith a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; body and engaged in an action that IS driven by some co=\r\nnditioning, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; however subtle or pure or dharmik that conditioni=\r\nng may be (!), then &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that sets in motion the law of kaarmik ac=\r\ntion-reaction which will in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; due time give a particular reacti=\r\non to what one identified with when &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; engaging in that action.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; By the time the reaction is experienced, all the conditioning =\r\nmay be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; overcome and one may become jeevanmukta. Yet, the mome=\r\nntum set in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; motion before one became jeevanmukta will continu=\r\ne to affect the body, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; senses and sensory mind, i.e. whatever =\r\none&#39;s ahamkara is identifying &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; with. But, because\n there is no=\r\n conditioning and hence no agendas, no &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; desires, no likes and =\r\ndislikes, one neither rejoices nor protests nor &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; tries to modi=\r\nfy the happenings to what one is identifying with.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; *&nbsp; &nb=\r\nsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sensing that =\r\nthere is a pain requires no conditioning. It is the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; function =\r\nof manas, i.e. Chandra. Observing that there is more pain in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nthe evening than morning (or when swallowing) requires no &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; con=\r\nditioning. It is the function of buddhi, i.e. Budha. But thinking &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; of praying to god to reduce pain requires conditioning in chitta &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; (absent in a jeevanmukta!).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Though a jeevanmukta is i=\r\ndentifying with a body, one does not view it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; as something his=\r\n own and something that must be kept in a particular &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; state. H=\r\ne identifies with it, but has no agendas for it. All\n that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; co=\r\nmes from conditioning in chitta, which is absent now!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The unco=\r\nnditioned identifier (liberated I-ness) views what one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; identi=\r\nfies with as an *amalgam* of portions borrowed from various &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; d=\r\neities (pancha mahabhootas, Moon, Mercury, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Time &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; etc) and hence as a manifestation of Light itself. One does not vi=\r\new &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; it from the prism of &quot;this is me, I need to use it to purs=\r\nue X or Y &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; agenda.&quot; One views it as &quot;this is me. I am made of =\r\nportions borrowed &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; from various deities, i.e. various manifest=\r\nations of Light. I observe &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; their play, i.e. what they do, and=\r\n I have no agenda pursue using &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; them.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; This is th=\r\ne essence of Upanishads and Yoga Vaasishtham, as well as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Mant=\r\nra Pushpam that we were discussing a while back.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I repeat, ide=\r\nntification is not the problem. It is the\n conditioning &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that =\r\ndrives how one uses what one identifies with, that is the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; pro=\r\nblem.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp=\r\n; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I now feel like I have expressed myself better, though, gi=\r\nven how &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; subtle and nuanced this knowledge is, some people may=\r\n still get &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; confused (if so, please don&#39;t worry. Not a big dea=\r\nl. Just keep doing &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana, for that&#39;s the most important thi=\r\nng!). I am grateful to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Manish and Maharshi Vasishtha for givi=\r\nng me this opportunity.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; BTW, whether Ramakrishna really got th=\r\nroat cancer because of his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;insult&quot; of Trilinga Swami or beca=\r\nuse he took the kaarmik power of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; attorney from Girish (a drun=\r\nkard and womanizer at the time) can be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; debated.

Some portions of the Tw=\r\nitter exchange are quoted at &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the end, in chronological or=\r\nder, in case someone is interested in the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; background. I w=\r\nill answer the following question posed by Manish &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; based o=\r\nn my understanding: &lt;&lt;&lt;The question to my mind is this: was &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt; Ramakrishna a Jeevanmukta? If so, Why did he suffer with throat=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; cancer if he was not identifying with his actions? (acco=\r\nrding to your &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; interpretation of Vasistha&#39;s definition??)&=\r\ngt;&gt;&gt; * =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&n=\r\nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A * =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A * Let me elaborate on my unders=\r\ntanding of jeevanmukti. Manish &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; loosely (in my view) said =\r\nin this exchange that rinas are of body and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a\n jeevanmukt=\r\na continues to fulfil those rinas. But body is an &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; insenti=\r\nent object. It has no rinas. The rinas are not of the body, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; but of the mind that identifies with it. It is the antahkaranas of &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt; mind - ahamkara (I-ness) and chitta (memory/conditioning) - th=\r\nat are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the source of various rinas, particularly chitta. =\r\nAs mind identifies &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with a body, it projects its rinas on =\r\nthe body and makes the body &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;do&quot; things,=\r\n in accordance with those &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; rinas/conditioning. If the cond=\r\nitioning in chitta is completely wiped &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; out and ahamkara m=\r\nerges in Self, then it is mukti. But, if the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning=\r\n in chitta is completely wiped out and yet ahamkara &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; conti=\r\nnues to exist with no limiting notions (it is basically the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; conditioning in chitta that is limiting), then one\n becomes &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt; jeevanmukta (liberated while living). Unlike in the case of one who &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; leaves body and gets mukti, a jeevanmukta continues to hav=\r\ne an I-ness &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (but which is not limited by any notions or c=\r\nonditioning). This &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; unconditioned I-ness does project into=\r\n a body. But it does not say &quot;I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; am this body and hence th=\r\nis body should be kept healthy or strong&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (THAT would be =\r\nconditioning in chitta, which is wiped out now!). On &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the =\r\nother hand, it does not either say &quot;this body should be ignored &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt; and destroyed&quot;. Though conditioning is absent now, body keeps &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt; experiencing and doing things based on the *momentum* set in mo=\r\ntion &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; before one became jeevanmukta and engaged in conditi=\r\noned experiences &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and actions. This is like a fan turning =\r\nfor a while after the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n electricity has been stopped. Mana=\r\ns, buddhi and indriyas keep working &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; as they did before. I=\r\nf one has throat cancer, indriyas may sense &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; pain. Manas (=\r\nsensory/motor mind) may process that input and register &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; p=\r\nain. Buddhi may analyze various observations and draw various &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; conclusions (e.g. &quot;when I gulp or try to swallow food, it hurts even &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; more&quot;, &quot;when I take so and so herbal liquid, it feels bett=\r\ner&quot; etc). A &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; normal person whose conditioned mind (chitta)=\r\n says &quot;I should overcome &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and not have this pain&quot; may thin=\r\nk of various things to do and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; struggle with them. But an =\r\nunconditioned being has no such &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; considerations. Though on=\r\ne may feel and express the pain and other &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; objective exper=\r\niences, one reacts to it differently. * =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A * =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;\n =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A * Thi=\r\ns is a key point: Manas and buddhi are good at making &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; obj=\r\nective observations and rational deductions, but, by themselves, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;&gt; they do not have ANY agenda. They neither like something nor dislik=\r\ne &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; something. THAT comes from the conditioning in chitta! =\r\nThe hallmark &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of a jeevanmukta is that THAT is absent! * =\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A * =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A * &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Whether Ramakrishna was a jeevanmukta i=\r\ns a moot question. A better &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; way to express your question =\r\nis: Can a jeevanmukta get throat cancer &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and feel pain? Ho=\r\nw is it possible if there are no karmas or rinas &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; left? I =\r\nhave already answered it. But, let me sum it up briefly &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a=\r\ngain. Body, various body parts, jnanendriyas, karmendiyas, manas and &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt; buddhi of a jeevanmukta\n continue to operate as before. One&#39;s I=\r\n-ness &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is intact and does project itself onto those. But n=\r\neither I-ness nor &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; those things carry any rinas or karmas.=\r\n Chitta - the repository of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning and rinas - is c=\r\nlean. There are no limiting notions. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; One&#39;s body, indriyas=\r\n, manas &amp; buddhi keep experiencing and doing &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; things (=\r\ngood or bad!) based on the previous momentum set by the play &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&=\r\ngt; of rnas and karmas while some conditioning was left in chitta. Body, &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; various body parts, indriyas of jnana and karma and manas a=\r\nre all &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; portions borrowed from various deities. Ahamkara (=\r\nI-ness) infuses &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sentience into them by projecting awarene=\r\nss into them. The &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta is what drives h=\r\now all these are viewed and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; used. Instead of looking at a=\r\n sense organ as a portion of\n Indra or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Mitra, one views i=\r\nt as &quot;my so and so sense organ&quot;, due to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in c=\r\nhitta. That is what creates karmas and rinas. When &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that c=\r\nonditioning is *completely* overcome, ahamkara can still &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nproject awareness into those objects, but it sees them for what they &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt; are. It does not have false and limiting notions like &quot;this thr=\r\noat is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mine and MUST feel nice and not feel painful&quot;. * =\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A * =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A * Most people who may claim to be (or think the=\r\ny are) jeevanmuktas &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; are not really jeevanmuktas in today&#39;=\r\ns world. If one wants to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; understand the state of jeevanmu=\r\nkti, Yoga Vaasishtham is the best &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; book. The entire discou=\r\nrse by Maharshi Vasishtha to Lord Rama is a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; detailed and =\r\nelaborate definition and\n characterization of a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmuk=\r\nta. There may be other books that explain better how to do &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n; various sadhanas to progress spiritually and get closer to being &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; liberated oneday. But, when it comes elaborating what liberation =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; while living actually is, there is none better than Yoga =\r\nVaasishtham. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, one can say that this is merely a=\r\nn intellectual exercise &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; as far as *we* are concerned. It =\r\nperhaps is, as none of may ever &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; become a jeevanmukta.. On=\r\ne word of caution: I write with a very &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; confident tone whe=\r\nn I have strong conviction in what I write. That is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; how I=\r\n am. But I can definitely be wrong. So please feel free to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n; ignore me! :-) Happy Shivaratri (tomorrow night) to all!

Nothin=\r\ng really,\n fulfilling all rnas, wait for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; rnas to be over.=\r\n Narasimha: If a &quot;jeevanmukta&quot; fails in &quot;fulfilling &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; all r=\r\nnas&quot;, will he b bound again? If no, y r they called rnas? If &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&=\r\ngt; yes, y call him mukta? Manish: No, rnas will work out themselves, &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt; slowly or fast as may be the case. The rnas are of the body he=\r\n or she &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; occupies. He is mukta because he experiences, act=\r\nually sees the rnas &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to be the body&#39;s only. Rnas apply to =\r\nthe body, not to you. You are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that &quot;speck of effulgent li=\r\nght&quot;, call it what you want, Atma, etc. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: Well, =\r\nthat speck of effulgent light was never bound. So, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; who ex=\r\nactly bcame &quot;mukta&quot;? Did &amp; does he/it have rnas? If these &quot;rnas &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt; of body&quot; r somehow not fulfilled after one bcomes jeevanmukta, w=\r\nhat &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; happens to one? :-) Manish: You are right. The mind\n =\r\nthought, that, it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; was the body, instead of this light. Th=\r\nat is the original problem. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Which every being is born wit=\r\nh. Rnas arise from this identification &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; which creates karm=\r\na. U r not that, so u r not bound, when the mind &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; realises=\r\n this. Became &quot;Mukta&quot; is also not quite true, since u r that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&=\r\ngt; &quot;Light&quot; frm d beginning Narasimha: Then, r the rnas of the &quot;body&quot; as &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; u said r of the mind? When a mind identifies with light &am=\r\np; bcomes &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mukta, does it hv rnas left? Manish: Ok, karmas=\r\n projected into mind, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; are acted on and may be experienced=\r\n by body. So, why is a jeevanmukta &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; subject to this? becau=\r\nse, that person although aware of the light at &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; all times,=\r\n and of the causal n subtle bodies, has not yet directed d &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n; mind to identify as that light at all times, key word being\n &quot;all&quot;. &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt; This gives karmas time to work. Next stage is 24/7 id with lig=\r\nht &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: As per my understanding, the person u r def=\r\nining is not a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta. He may b an elevated being, b=\r\nut not mukta (liberated) &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; yet. Manish: I derive that defin=\r\nition of this &quot;state&quot; from somebody, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; no problem in disagr=\r\neement. 24/7 identification with light, most &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; likely body =\r\nshould not exist, no? Narasimha: Id with light forever &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; wi=\r\nth body dropping off is just mukti, not jivanmukti! Jivanmukti is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; where body stays. Is body really different from light? In fact, is=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; there anything other than light? Jivanmukti is seeing th=\r\ne play of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; objects but seeing all as light. Mukti &amp; rn=\r\na are contradictory &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; concepts &amp; cant coexist. U rnt &quot;f=\r\nree&quot; till u pay back what u owe. And &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n that means u dont o=\r\nwe anybody anything once u r truly free. Words &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; like free,=\r\n liberated &amp; jivanmukta r often misused. Manish: Will &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n explain a bit in detail sometime. Narasimha: OK. :-) But, as far as &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt; &quot;explaining&quot; is concerned, Vasishtha explained as clearly &amp;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; elaborately as any human being can ever hope 2. Manish: =\r\nThe question &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to my mind is this: was Ramakrishna a Jeevan=\r\nmukta? If so, Why did he &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; suffer with throat cancer if he =\r\nwas not identifying with his actions? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (according to your =\r\ninterpretation of Vasistha&#39;s definition??) &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: Vas=\r\nishtha didnt give a single definition. His entire &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; discour=\r\nse 2 Rama is a definition of jeevanmukta! Will answer ur RK qn &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt; later.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://grou=\r\nps.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot;\n target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://docs.ya=\r\nhoo.com/info/terms/&quot; target=3D_blank&gt;http://docs.yahoo\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
