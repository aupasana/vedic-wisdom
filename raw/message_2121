It has been observed that if you place coconut pieces where white po=\r\nrtion remains up (pieces rest on dark side) then there are all the chances =\r\nthat pieces may not burnt fully. this is my personal experience. so i can s=\r\nuggest few things as under:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Keep Dark side up\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - =\r\nKeep the pieces such that they don&#39;t pile on each other.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Keep the=\r\n pieces such a way that it forms a pyramid shape (top of that shape is open=\r\ned so that Aahuti can be offered conveniently in that. i mean, there should=\r\n be a scope for air to pass under the pieces.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is my exp=\r\nerience that coconut peices do get burnt completely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best =\r\nRegards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, &quot;naaraayana_iyer&quot; &lt;narayan.iyer@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nam=\r\naste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1)While doing homam can we move the=\r\n coconut pieces that are there in the havan kund, so that they get burned e=\r\nasily.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i asked it becoz would it be right to poke in the fire w=\r\nith a stick while we are actually assuming Ganpati is in that fire and the =\r\nidol at that time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes.
