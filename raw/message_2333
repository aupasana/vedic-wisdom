How can nature tell of the Infinite, the\nUnchangeable, the Un=\r\nbroken, the Indivisible, the Eternal? It never can.Even\nin our lives, in th=\r\ne life of every one of us here, there come moments of\ncalmness, perhaps, wh=\r\nen we see before us the death of one we loved, when\nsome shock comes to us,=\r\n or when extreme blessedness comes to us. Many other\noccasions there are wh=\r\nen the mind, as it were, becomes calm, feels for the\nmoment its real nature=\r\n; and a glimpse of the Infinite beyond, where words\ncannot reach nor the mi=\r\nnd go, is revealed to us.\n\nConsciousness is bound by the senses. Beyond tha=\r\nt, beyond the senses, men\nmust go in order to arrive at truths of the spiri=\r\ntual world, and there are\neven now persons who succeed in going beyond the =\r\nbounds of the senses. These\nare called Rishis, because they come face to fa=\r\nce with spiritual truths.\n\nAny attempt to modernise our women, if it tries =\r\nto take our women away from\nthat ideal of Sita, is immediately a failure, a=\r\ns we see every day. The women\nof India must grow and develop in the footpri=\r\nnts of Sita, and that is the\nonly way.\n\nA great landmark in the history of =\r\nreligion is here, the ideal of love for\nlove&#39;s sake, work for work&#39;s sake, =\r\nduty for duty&#39;s sake, and it for the\nfirst time fell from the lips of the g=\r\nreatest of Incarnations, Krishna, and\nfor the first time in the history of =\r\nhumanity, upon the soil of India. The\nreligions of fear and of temptations =\r\nwere gone for ever, and in spite of the\nfear of hell and temptation of enjo=\r\nyment in heaven, came the grandest of\nideals, love for love&#39;s sake, duty fo=\r\nr duty&#39;s sake, work for work&#39;s sake.\n\nThere was a book written a year or tw=\r\no ago by a Russian gentleman, who\nclaimed to have found out a very curious =\r\nlife of Jesus Christ, and in one\npart of the book he says that Christ went =\r\nto the temple of Jagannath to\nstudy with the Brahmins, but became disgusted=\r\n with their exclusiveness and\ntheir idols, and so he went to the Lamas of T=\r\nibet instead, became perfect,\nand went home.\n\nTo any man who knows anything=\r\n about Indian history, that very statement\nproves that the whole thing was =\r\na fraud, because the temple of Jagannath is\nan old Buddhistic temple. We to=\r\nok this and others over and re-Hinduised\nthem. We shall have to do many thi=\r\nngs like that yet. That is Jagannath, and\nthere was not one Brahmin there t=\r\nhen, and yet we are told that Jesus Christ\ncame to study with the Brahmins =\r\nthere. So says our great Russian\narchaeologist.\n\nThis one great Northern sa=\r\nge, Chaitanya, represented the mad love of the\nGopis. Himself a Brahmin, bo=\r\nrn of one of the most rationalistic families of\nthe day, himself a professo=\r\nr of logic fighting and gaining a word-victory =97\nfor, this he had learnt =\r\nfrom his childhood as the highest ideal of life and\nyet through the mercy o=\r\nf some sage the whole life of that man became\nchanged; he gave up his fight=\r\n, his quarrels, his professorship of logic and\nbecame one of the greatest t=\r\neachers of Bhakti the world has ever known =97 mad\nChaitanya.\n\nHis Bhakti r=\r\nolled over the whole land of Bengal, bringing solace to every\none. His love=\r\n knew no bounds. The saint or the sinner, the Hindu or the\nMohammedan, the =\r\npure or the impure, the prostitute, the streetwalker =97 all\nhad a share in=\r\n his love, all had a share in his mercy: and even to the\npresent day, altho=\r\nugh greatly degenerated, as everything does become in\ntime, his sect is the=\r\n refuge of the poor, of the downtrodden, of the\noutcast, of the weak, of th=\r\nose who have been rejected by all society. But at\nthe same time I must rema=\r\nrk for truth&#39;s sake that we find this: In the\nphilosophic sects we find won=\r\nderful liberalisms.\n\nSource:\nhttp://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Wor=\r\nks_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_3/Lectures_from_Colombo_to_Almora/The_Sages_=\r\nof_India\n\n-- \nOm Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya\nPrasanth Jalasutram\n\nLove And =\r\nLove Alone\n\r\n--001636025e7d1a19720471f1f985\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-fami=\r\nly: Verdana; &quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;post-body entry-content&quot; style=3D&quot;margin-top: =\r\n0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px; line-heigh=\r\nt: 1.3em; &quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold; &quot;&gt;THE SAGES OF INDIA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style: italic; &quot;&gt;Volume 3, Lectures from Colombo to =\r\nAlmora&lt;/span&gt;=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This mind is continually changing, always in a stat=\r\ne of flux; it is finite, it is broken into pieces.
