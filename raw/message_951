Mind connects the material and non-material realms of exper=\r\nience. So all experiences of mind cannot be studied by physics or modern sc=\r\nience in general.\n \nI want to narrate a small incident. At this time, the p=\r\nerson in question prefers not to be explicitly identified.\n \n*        *    =\r\n    *\n \nOne man was sleeping oneday. In the middle of the night, he woke up=\r\n. When he was still on the bed and partially awake, his shakti rose. In oth=\r\ner words, his self-awareness got refined. He first perceived a tremendous b=\r\nolt of electricity going up in his back. Then, in a split second, his perce=\r\nption of that electricity changed from &quot;shakti inside me&quot; to &quot;I inside shak=\r\nti&quot;. His changed perception was that there was a tremendous amount of shakt=\r\ni that was surging up like an ocean wave and encompassing everything that w=\r\nas there and that he was a very tiny particle in that tremendous wave. More=\r\nover, he also &quot;heard&quot; a specific beejaakshara being chanted together by mil=\r\nlions of people, who were all tiny particles in that wave. That wave reverb=\r\nerated with the sound of that beejaakshara and he perceived that he too was=\r\n chanting that beejaakshara along with all. His mind was filled with that s=\r\nound and a kind of bliss. His self-awareness was that of a tiny particle fi=\r\nlled with that sound and joy. He was in that state for a while. Suddenly a =\r\nthought that can be loosely expressed as &quot;I am on the bed in a room. How am=\r\n I hearing all this? Are there people in the room&quot; came to his mind. That t=\r\nhought disturbed the state of his mind and his shakti came down. In other w=\r\nords, he returned to the regular level of self-awareness and again perceive=\r\nd that he was a body lying on a bed in a room. The bliss was gone and mind =\r\nwas again filled with hundreds of thoughts as usual.\n \nHe mentioned this in=\r\ncident a few days later to his spiritual guru, who lived thousands of miles=\r\n away and a few hours ahead of him. When this happened, it was the middle o=\r\nf the night for him and morning for his guru. When he mentioned the inciden=\r\nt and said that he heard the sound of a beejaakshara reverberating in the w=\r\nave in which he was a small particle, his guru said he knew it and also men=\r\ntioned the specific beejaakshara and asked &quot;that is what you heard, right?&quot;=\r\n That was indeed correct. When he confirmed, his guru shed some light: &quot;I w=\r\nas at that time meditating with that beejaakshara. So and so deity came and=\r\n filled my consciousness. I then went into samadhi. Some people close to me=\r\n may also have experienced that deity at that time. But we should realize t=\r\nhat this is all Her play and we are just nimittas. What she does and why sh=\r\ne does, she knows and we do not. We are just dummies observing what comes o=\r\nur way. We neither make anything happen nor should we desire anything to ha=\r\nppen. Just be and observe. Do not be attracted or repelled by anything.&quot;\n \n=\r\n*        *        *\n \nIf you are talking about the mystical experiences per=\r\nceived by a single mind, the possibility of hallucination cannot be discoun=\r\nted. However, when two people independently experienced something similar a=\r\nnd one of them knew that the other one experienced it, it shows that there =\r\nis something here. It shows that the ultimate Reality is *beyond* the reali=\r\nty that can be perceived by senses and studied by modern science.\n \nMind is=\r\n the connection between the material and non-material worlds.\n \nEgo, the se=\r\nnse of &quot;I&quot;, is what blocks one from higher things. Notions like &quot;I am the b=\r\nody&quot;, &quot;I should be safe&quot;, &quot;I should be happy&quot; etc block one and limit one&#39;s=\r\n self-awareness to a gross body and its gross external senses. When the sel=\r\nf-awareness changes to that of a tiny particle at His/Her feet, it is a lot=\r\n more blissful state to be in. But, we are kept away from that because our =\r\nself-awareness is different and more gross and we cannot let it go! We just=\r\n hang on to an undesirable self-awareness.\n \n*        *        *\n \nI want t=\r\no make one thing clear. When I write about any mystical experiences, there =\r\nis a chance of influencing someone wrongly. Luckily for me, the first thing=\r\n my guru did with me was to de-emphasize the value of mystical experiences.=\r\n I was prepared by him to look at them as just any other experiences in the=\r\n material world. They really are. When one goes on a road, one sees nice sc=\r\nenery on the side. Some scenery on a normal road may be accessible to every=\r\none and some scenery at a high altitude hill road may be seen by very few. =\r\nBut the bottomline is that both are sceneries and one should learn to just =\r\nsee it, appreciate it and move on. If attachment is built with a scenery or=\r\n one becomes proud of oneself for having seen a scenery, it is foolish. Suc=\r\nh feelings can distract one from the final goal and slow down one&#39;s journey=\r\n. Nothing in the 14 worlds needs to be desired or feared. Just observe what=\r\n comes your way and continue your journey.\n \nA mystical experience can prom=\r\note pride in one (&quot;I am good and I got this&quot;, &quot;I did good sadhana and so I =\r\ngot this&quot;, &quot;I deserve this&quot; etc) or attachment or possessiveness or a sense=\r\n of entitlement. That can trap one and slow down spiritual progress. The ul=\r\ntimate goal of spiritual sadhana is to kill pride and overcome ego complete=\r\nly. That should be remembered at all times.\n \nI know that I mention this ag=\r\nain and again. But internet and e-archives are a nonlinear medium. I want t=\r\no make this key point in every relevant mail.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n---=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short =\r\nHomam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Your=\r\nself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.ya=\r\nhoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.ho=\r\nme.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n-------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------- \n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0A87_01C97903.B8B4CFD0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3492&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste=\r\n,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;F=\r\nONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Mantras work beyond the physical sound energy lev=\r\nel \nand work at the mind level.
