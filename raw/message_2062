I understand that you are not able to type out (Phonetically or otherw=\r\nise) the Gayatri mantra, however does this prohibition apply to the &quot;Pre Ga=\r\nyatri&quot; ? This is actually something I was most confused about as to pronunc=\r\niation:\n\n&quot;Om bhur bhuva swaha&quot;,  I have also seen as &quot;Om bhu bhuvaha swaha&quot;=\r\n.  Does the &quot;r&quot; in &quot;bhur&quot; get vocalized? Is &quot;bhuva&quot; correct or is it the la=\r\nter and in both instances regarding &quot;bhuva&quot; or &quot;bhuvaha&quot; is the &quot;u&quot; pronoun=\r\nced like &quot;boo&quot; or more like in &quot;but&quot;.\n\nThank you very much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; N=\r\namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; I cannot point to any audio that I found satisfactory.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pl=\r\nease buy the book &quot;Mantrapushpam&quot; by Ramakrishna Mutt. It gives Gayatri \n&gt; =\r\nmantra with intonation marked correctly. It has many other veda mantras too=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; I will point out a few standard mistakes I have seen people make:\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; (1) People normally pronounce anudattas and svaritas (letters with lines=\r\n \n&gt; below or above) correctly, but mess up when a few udattas come in a row=\r\n. For \n&gt; example, all the three letters in &quot;dheemahi&quot; are without any lines=\r\n below or \n&gt; above. They have to be pronounced in the same pitch. People en=\r\nd up \n&gt; introducing some pitch variation and mispronouncing them. In veda m=\r\nantras, \n&gt; pronouncing all udattas in the same pitch is the most important =\r\nthing. Do \n&gt; not stress any letter or take the pitch up/down when pronounci=\r\nng a string of \n&gt; udattas.\n&gt; \n&gt; (2) The last syllable of &quot;prachodayaat&quot; is =\r\n&quot;yaat&quot;. It is supposed to be one \n&gt; syllable. When you pronounce it correct=\r\nly, &quot;t&quot; is hardly audible. If you \n&gt; artificially add an vowel at the end o=\r\nf it and make it &quot;prachodayaatu&quot;, you \n&gt; will end up introducing an extra s=\r\nyllable (&quot;tu&quot;) and mess up everything. A \n&gt; lot of people do not pronounce =\r\n&quot;t&quot; correctly. Probably some guru sometime \n&gt; back started the practice of =\r\nadding a brief vowel at the end of words ending \n&gt; in a consonant, so that =\r\nhis sishyas could listen clearly what consonant he \n&gt; was saying. Unfortuna=\r\ntely, it became a standard practice. This is good for \n&gt; teaching, but wron=\r\ng for sadhana. If a word ends in a consonant, end it with \n&gt; a consonant (w=\r\nhich cannot be heard clearly unless one tried hard) and do NOT \n&gt; add a bri=\r\nef vowel after that consonant.\n&gt; \n&gt; (3) Take &quot;dhiyo yo naH&quot;. The &quot;H&quot; in &quot;na=\r\nH&quot; is a visarga (written in Sanskrit \n&gt; as &quot;:&quot; and notated in itrans as &quot;H&quot;=\r\n). Visarga means &quot;letting go&quot;. You are \n&gt; supposed to let air go from you l=\r\nungs in a quick exhalation. Pronunciation \n&gt; of &quot;naH&quot; is very close to &quot;nah=\r\n&quot; though slightly different. Again, this is \n&gt; supposed to be one syllable.=\r\n A lot of people, especially south Indians, make \n&gt; it &quot;naha&quot;. Due to extra=\r\n vowel added (a), an extra syllable (ha) is added to \n&gt; the mantra and that=\r\n messes up everything. Again this is wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; In this style of mispronou=\r\nncing visarga, the same symbol &quot;H&quot; is pronounced \n&gt; differently in &quot;raamaH&quot;=\r\n, &quot;hariH&quot; and &quot;guruH&quot;. The same symbol\n&gt; &quot;H&quot; or &quot;:&quot; is pronounced as &quot;ha&quot;, =\r\n&quot;hi&quot; and &quot;hu&quot; in the 3 words, respectively \n&gt; (i.e. raamaha, harihi, guruhu=\r\n). That is wrong. If you pronounce it as \n&gt; letting air go, without adding =\r\nany vowel, it sounds identical in the 3 \n&gt; words.\n&gt; \n&gt; Watch out for these =\r\n3 common mistakes.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, as I keep saying, the pronunciation is onl=\r\ny a small percentage of \n&gt; it. Creating the right mental images and the per=\r\nfect mental focus is more \n&gt; important. If you lose awareness of your body,=\r\n successfully shut down all \n&gt; other thoughts in the mind and achieve a per=\r\nfect mental focus on any veda \n&gt; mantra with correct pronunciation, it will=\r\n be a fantastic experience. Please \n&gt; note that correct pronunciation is no=\r\nt difficult to achieve, but the other \n&gt; things I mentioned here are not th=\r\nat easy!\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisd=\r\nom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free =\r\nJyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath =\r\nCentre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -----------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message --=\r\n--- \n&gt; From: &quot;sbm_sharma&quot; &lt;sbm_sharma@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, June 24, 2009 8:57 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Pro=\r\nper Gayatri Mantra Pronunciation and Intonation - \n&gt; Audio Source\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Could you point me towards any easily obtainable a=\r\nudio recording of the \n&gt; &gt; Gayatri mantra which you deem to be correctly ex=\r\necuted?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also, would you mind typing it out here, phonetically?
