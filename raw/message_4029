Only very advanced sadhakas will be able to identify\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rnas / karmic debts and know how/where/why they are to be paid off. T=\r\nhe rest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of us have to follow dharma, which includes standing up for w=\r\nhat is right\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and righteous and not being defeatist or fatalistic. Oth=\r\nerwise, Arjuna could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have written off the wrongs of the Kauravas as a=\r\n massive rnu, but of course,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Krishna urged him to take up the dharma =\r\nof kshatriyahood and slay without\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mercy. The webs of karma are too in=\r\ntricate and complex and delicate to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; comprehended unless one has re=\r\nached certain very very high levels of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual attainment, and even=\r\n then, it will only be a partial vision. Only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; S/He who is unlimited (=\r\nIswara/i) knows and sees the entire web of karma and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; knows best how t=\r\no dispatch rnus as necessary.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Aditiji and others,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun could do what he did for a reason.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun was a gre=\r\nat sadhaka himself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What he did was sort of simple. He did so much sa=\r\ndhana of a deity that this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; deity began to occupy him day and night. T=\r\nhis deity was a form of Shiva.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; That in turn gave him the rarest of ra=\r\nre opportunity to be with Krishna at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the time of the battle, because =\r\nShiva is the greatest Vaishnava, the only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one who knows how to worshi=\r\np Krishna properly. Only by becoming Shiva\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yourself can you worship K=\r\nrishna perfectly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, at the time of the battle, Arjun was be=\r\nset with doubt, but when he saw\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Viswharoopa something crazy happe=\r\nned as if Krishna was within him. Of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; course Krishna was present even =\r\nbefore, but Arjun could not perceive Him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; properly. this was Krishna&#39;s=\r\n lila or play of course, because otherwise would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun have treated h=\r\nim as a friend ever??!!(slapping Him on the back,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; playing tricks on H=\r\nim, but the Lord loves to play with His genuine devotees)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, =\r\nnow once Arjun&#39;s remnant personality was further effaced and replaced by\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Krishna in his form as Kaala Viswharoopa, then it was effectively Krish=\r\nna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; who destroyed the Kauravas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is why at the end of the ba=\r\nttle when all the Pandavas went to ask the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; person who had been decapi=\r\ntated by Krishna&#39;s Sudarshana but who was still\n&gt; &gt; &gt; kept alive at the top=\r\n of the tree,..... about who was responsible for the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Pandava&#39;s victor=\r\ny.........\n&gt; &gt; &gt; All that man said was that at the beginning of the day he =\r\ncould see the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sudarshana start out from one end of the battlefield, t=\r\nhen having done all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that destruction, it would return to krishna&#39;s ha=\r\nnd at the end of the day.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And the blood which was being spilt was dru=\r\nnk by Krishna Shakti or Kali.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun was lucky, He had God inca=\r\nrnate at His side, others may not be quite\n&gt; &gt; &gt; so fortunate. For example,=\r\n Ramakrishna used to say that a doctor&#39;s money was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; blood and pus (I l=\r\neft my thriving surgical career when I read this a few\n&gt; &gt; &gt; years ago).\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; He said something similar about the money earned by a lawyer.(I think h=\r\ne was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; referring to criminal law in that time).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Easiest t=\r\nhing to do is Ishwar(Ishwari) pranidhana. Surrender to God. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; freely =\r\nadmitted to the Lord when I had His darshana that I was a complete\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fo=\r\nol and knew nothing at all. She taught me all I know because of this.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Whatever you ever do in life, just try and be straight in every dealing\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; that you have with anybody, give whatever you can, turn away nobody fro=\r\nm\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your door, who knows when God will come to test you?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; T=\r\nhis does not mean that one is fatalistic and does nothing, but it means\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; that terrific sadhana is useful, nay even necessary.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sadhan=\r\na and a real Guru (Gu kara&#39;s cha andhakas cha-removes darkness Ru kas\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n cha Teja Uchayte- brings light into the being), are essential. Before I me=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; my real Guru, I saw plenty of guys who were basically sadhakas them=\r\nselves, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; used to ask and swear at them, &quot;You are blind yourself, how=\r\n will you lead\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the blind me to God, when you have not seen God yourse=\r\nlf face to face?!!! &quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Once you take Time out of the equation (=\r\nbecause a deity has a different time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; space frame which runs in thousa=\r\nnds of years which pass by in a blink of an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; eye) by waiting with pati=\r\nence, then where will God go? God has to come, He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can&#39;t escape.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Love\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Manish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Sat, Feb 27, 2010 a=\r\nt 9:05 PM, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you see the old mail quoted by Hemanth below, it will answer you=\r\nr\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just because a group of people think so=\r\nmething is their dharma and do it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does not free them from karma. Th=\r\nat may not even really be their dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Knowing one&#39;s dharma, as ex=\r\nplained below, is very difficult. As one becomes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purer, one&#39;s dharm=\r\na becomes clearer to one. The sense of dharma of a densely\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conditio=\r\nned mind is corrupted by that conditioning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Secondly, even =\r\ndoing one&#39;s true dharma does not mean one does not incur\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; karma. If =\r\nNature selects someone, because of one&#39;s prior conditioning and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deb=\r\nts, to kill thousand bad people, and one fulfils dharma by killing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nthousand bad people, that person WILL incur new karma for it. Dharma (duty)=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and moksha (liberation) are two different purusharthas and not one=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fulfilling dharma is helpful for liberation, but not sufficient.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In addition to doing dharma, one needs to overcome ego (I-n=\r\ness) and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doership. As ego and the sense of doership goes down, the =\r\nspeed at which new\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; karmas are incurred goes down. Dharma becomes cl=\r\nearer. For liberation, one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; needs to lower ego and the sense of doer=\r\nship and do one&#39;s dharma (i.e. pay\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back debts) without attachment a=\r\nnd doership.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The mail quoted by Hemanth clarifies some key =\r\nconcepts and worth reading\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and understanding carefully.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Free Jyotish Software, Free =\r\nJyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals =\r\nfor short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                  http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAstrologer.org&lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     Films that mak=\r\ne a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     Spirituality: http://=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Jyotish writings: http://group=\r\ns.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- Se Am &lt;mahalaxmyey@=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i heard that Muslims used to behead meditating sages hea=\r\nd when they were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; meditating\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so Muslims dharma is to kill =\r\nother religious people\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so will Muslims attact bad karma or sin?\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: Hemanth Srinivas &lt;hemanthks@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-=\r\nwisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, even I think one has to fol=\r\nlow Dharma.

Right action=\r\n varies from person to person, from time to time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and from place t=\r\no place. It is dependent on what nature expects from you,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which i=\r\nn turn is based on who you have been in the past, what actions you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; did in the past while identifying with the action, who you affected in\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; past (and how) with the actions that you identified wit=\r\nh, what debts you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; created in the process, and what mental tendenc=\r\nies you accumulated until\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If, based on o=\r\nne&#39;s mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to kill evil persons, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; mental\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person =\r\nto spread the message\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; uniformity of all religions, tha=\r\nt becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mental tendenc=\r\nies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ritual =\r\nof homam in the world, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to ma=\r\nke a lot\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; money and construct a temple, that becomes on=\r\ne&#39;s dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The dharma of a b=\r\neing may change from one life to another.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the time o=\r\nf Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma to kill his gurus,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; elde=\r\nrs and relatives. The time then was such that there was too much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we=\r\night\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weig=\r\nht.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tremendous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; destruction was to take place and civiliza=\r\ntion destroyed to a great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extent,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to welcome Kali yuga an=\r\nd set the tone for it. Arjuna being a great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warrior,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it w=\r\nas his dharma to facilitate that. Some people he deeply loved and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n respected were on the other side and it was his dharma to kill them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as o=\r\nne of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been=\r\n Arjuna in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; previous life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharm=\r\na was different in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new time and place. He was born t=\r\no renounce material life despite his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aristocratic upbringing and =\r\nlive the simple life of a monk and inspire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generations to embrace=\r\n a simple life of mental detachment and service to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others. When h=\r\ne is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said), =\r\nhis dharma based on the time and place may be something else.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The tricky question is: How does one decid=\r\ne what is one&#39;s dharma?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some people have interpreted Kr=\r\nishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your own\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and not some=\r\none else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism. Though the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concept\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long time, the conc=\r\nept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a =\r\nshudra who lived by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; killing birds. He became a brahmana and a mah=\r\narshi later. Vishwamitra was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kshatrita and a powerful k=\r\ning. He became a brahmana and and a maharshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later. Basically var=\r\nna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; varna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of=\r\n father, because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; develops in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one does.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells =\r\nyou to know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreove=\r\nr, there are not just 4 dharmas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the world. Each person=\r\n has individual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is is=\r\n very very very difficult. If one is pure\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough, one will *know*=\r\n one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind=\r\n that tells us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; noise from other parts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, we ge=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confused.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We should make the best judgment =\r\ncombining discrimination and intuition\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decide what is=\r\n our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; the best we can is all that we can do!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; More than f=\r\nollowing dharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; act=\r\nions without identification. *That* alone ensures that we are not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; build\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too much attachment to what we are doing. We should enga=\r\nge in the best\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible actions (based on our best judgment on wh=\r\nat our dharma in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; given\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; situation is), with as little =\r\nattachment and self-identification with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; action as possible. W=\r\nhen the action is finished, we should leave the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; result\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to=\r\n god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; work&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; untached action) will simplify our ego and purify our consciousne=\r\nss\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slowly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As we become purer, our mind will work sharper=\r\n and tell our dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clearer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a positive feedbac=\r\nk here. This will slowly enable us to see our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma clearly and =\r\nfollow it without incurring new karmas. This is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easy,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n but not as difficult as people think.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The bottomline i=\r\ns: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one engages in action wit=\r\nh\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little attachment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are the inputs.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Another external input is the words of scriptures and learned men.=\r\n One\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; derive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place i=\r\ns given to one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; master.

When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was co=\r\nnfused about his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and wanted to renounce the world =\r\nand go to a secluded place to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Par=\r\namahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; material\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; world and do the work of Mother for him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One who i=\r\ns not in tune with nature and does not know who one is, what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; debts are and what nature expects from one can err in the judgmen=\r\nt of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated s=\r\noul with a clear insight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s inner core, such a gu=\r\nru can give perfect guidance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Bottomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles and\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; declare that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to pers=\r\non,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time to time and from place to place. Also, ther=\r\ne are no thumbrules to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; find\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out what one&#39;s dharma is. But=\r\n, one can refine one&#39;s understanding of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma by i=\r\nncreasing internal purity. By doing various kinds of spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sa=\r\ndhana (like homam, japam etc) and engaging in actions without much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; attachment, one can slowly purify oneself and refine one&#39;s understanding\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s individual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -------\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Sense of Distinction and of good and evil is bound to p=\r\nersist so long as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one does not realize God&quot; - Ramakrishna Paramaham=\r\nsa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Fri, Feb 26, 2010 at 8:10 AM, Aditi Banerjee &lt;ban=\r\nerjeea@gmail. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I agree =\r\nwith Dinesh.

He follows up for the money but with the at=\r\ntitude\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of detachment. Although he shows to his family and friends t=\r\nhat he is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extremely concerned and it was foolish act etc...

He thinks that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they were Money of Mother and she will t=\r\nake care. If they needed to come\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back, she will do it or if they we=\r\nre to be paid to nullify some past rinas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then they will not come ba=\r\nck.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; With the Second=\r\n Approach, I think, Mr. FL will not Create New Rinas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and will be ab=\r\nle to break free from this particular chain.

If your partner is willing, use Shiva lata and do not be\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; disheartened by failure initially. As time goes on, the=C3=82 thing in y=\r\nour mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which thinks of sex is incinerated and slowly you find tha=\r\nt a naked\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; female(or male as=C3=82 may be the case)=C3=82 body is li=\r\nke a landscape picture just\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like any other picture made by Her of n=\r\nature(like Niagara falls, or Angkor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wat, you need not be disturbed =\r\nby it, you can certainly=C3=82 feel that the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; picture=C3=82 is very =\r\nbeautiful=C3=82 but you need not be aroused by it).

The idea is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that one is not bound by Maayaa once one *fu=\r\nlly* understands and appreciates\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Chandipath consists of symbolic storie=\r\ns of wars that the divine\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mother fought, which explain how one can =\r\nfight and overcome various\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weaknesses that typically bind one in Ma=\r\nayaa. Reciting these stories on a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regular basis will promote the fi=\r\nghting spirit within one that fights these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weaknesses.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; There is nothing wro=\r\nng in understanding Maayaa and trying to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fight/overcome it at the s=\r\name time.

For now I have very mixed feelings on the subject.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps I need to read more!=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Aghora series books by Svoboda are =\r\ngood, but Aghora is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everyone&#39;s cup of tea. It is normal to have=\r\n mixed feelings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Ghora means terribl=\r\ne. Aghora means &quot;not terrible&quot;. One of the names\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of Lord Shiva is A=\r\nghora. A true=C3=82 Aghora (aghori) does not see anything as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; terrib=\r\nle or bad or impure and sees all as impermanent manifestations of god\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; and tries to focus the thinking of the mind on what is permanent (god)\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; always, instead of impermanent manifestations of god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; When someone dies, nor=\r\nth Indians chant &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; carrying the dead bod=\r\ny to the funeral. It means &quot;only the name of Lord Rama\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is true and =\r\neverything else is an illusion&quot;. The idea is to remind oneself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that=\r\n life and death are just a temporary illusion and only the Lord is real.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But the question is: why should we remind ourselves of this ultimate =\r\ntruth\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only when someone dies? When someone praises us for a suppose=\r\ndly great thing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we have done and we are about to feel proud and hap=\r\npy, can&#39;t we tell\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing we di=\r\nd and the praises are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. L=\r\net the mind not dwell on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illusions&quot;? When we feel attract=\r\ned to something beautiful and want\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to get it, can&#39;t we tell ourselv=\r\nes &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems beautiful and other=\r\n things that seem not so beautiful are temporary\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illusions. Only th=\r\ne Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  illusions&quot;?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; When someone attacks and abuses=\r\n us and we are about to feel sad or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; angry, can&#39;t we tell ourselves =\r\n&quot;Raama naam satya hai. These abuses are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illusions. Only t=\r\nhe Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illusions&quot;?&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; A true Ag=\r\nhora&#39;s mind thinks &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; always. His mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rejects =\r\nall *impermanent manifestations* of Lord (instead of *dwelling* on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nthem by classifying them as pure and impure, good and bad etc and thinking\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about them with attraction/aversion ) and tries to find and focus o=\r\nn what is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permanent. But he takes it to extremes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=\r\n=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82=\r\n  *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Vedanta says &quot;all is Self. The v=\r\nariety we perceive is an illusion&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An aghora pursues it practicall=\r\ny. If feces and fruit are both impermenant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illusions and the only p=\r\nermanent reality within them is the Self, he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; questions why he can e=\r\nat fruit but not feces. So he may try a ritual where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feces is eaten=\r\n.=C3=82 But, please remember that eating feces is not the main\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; poin=\r\nt. Perceiving Self in the food being consumed and not perceiving an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n impermanent manifestation of Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main point. F=\r\nor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; example, eating feces with disgust serves no purpose, for such a=\r\n person&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind is dwelling on the impermenant manifestation of Self=\r\n (&quot;feces&quot;) while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eating it. A successful Aghora may be eating feces=\r\n, but the mind will not be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dwelling on the fact that he is eating &quot;=\r\nfeces&quot; with certain properties and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will not feel any kind of disgus=\r\nt. He will be thinking that he is Self and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he is eating Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Of course, a =\r\nvedantin also has the same notions really. He chants\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vedic verses w=\r\nhen eating food, which essentially mean &quot;I am Self and I am\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consumi=\r\nng Self&quot;. Nevertheless, such chanting may merely be a ritual and not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; be fully absorbed in one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on th=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; impermanant manifestations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly coo=\r\nked brinjal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver from th=\r\ne focus on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permanent (Self).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are telling=\r\n themselves the same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; truth and trying to absorb that truth into eve=\r\nry thought and impulse. But\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aghora is putting himself in an extreme=\r\n situation where failure results in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very bad dual experience. Tha=\r\nt can in fact work as an incentive in forcing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one to transcend dual=\r\nity! In the case of a person who chants a Vedic verse\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that says &quot;I =\r\nam Self and I am consuming Self&quot; and eats tasty laddus and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nicely m=\r\nade food, the fallout from failing to absorb the mind in Self while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n eating is not too bad. If the mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice=\r\n)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; taste of a laddu or other food, what is the big deal? On the othe=\r\nr hand, if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the mind fails to absorb in Self and dwells on the taste=\r\n of feces, it will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be so disgusting. Thus, the fact that failure re=\r\nsults in a very bad dual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experience may act as an incentive in succ=\r\needing quickly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, difficult tasks cannot necessarily be accomplished by\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; everyone merely because of an incentive. Not everyone trying Aghora sad=\r\nhanas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; succeeds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=\r\n=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Take another simple example. Suppose someone is =\r\ndoing a lot of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet having a weak=\r\nness for sex. Suppose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s mind is dwelling on sex or getting sexu=\r\nal thoughts in the middle of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana and that is causing guilt and =\r\nblocking one&#39;s sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; A regular person will try to enforce celibacy and keep the =\r\nmind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; away from sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula for overc=\r\noming such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thoughts. After all, such thoughts may still come and di=\r\nstract one. Even if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is no gu=\r\narantee that the fascination\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the mind does not return to bite on=\r\ne after that. But, how to overcome the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fascination some minds may h=\r\nave for sex?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; An aghora will take it to an extreme. He will try to fix the root\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; cause and remove fascination from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana =\r\nand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sex as two different activities (one pure and the other impure)=\r\n, he may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; combine them into one without such distinctions of pure vs=\r\n impure. Suppose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an aghora sits naked with his partner sitting nake=\r\nd on his lap and then does\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his japam. In the beginning, this may ti=\r\ntillate and result in sex. He may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think that his sadhana is being m=\r\nade impure. But, suppose he persists to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; japam like that for seve=\r\nral months/years. Eventually, mind may be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reprogrammed. He may no l=\r\nonger feel that he is doing something impure. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may no longer feel=\r\n titillation. The association in his mind between\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nakedness and sex=\r\n may be broken down. Seeing naked pictures physically or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mentally m=\r\nay no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; meditatio=\r\nn. Any small thoughts related to sex that suddenly rise in the head\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n may not lead to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  denser and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in sadhana, but\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; they may now take the mind back to meditation. After spending so much =\r\ntime\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in meditation while sitting naked intimately, the attraction a=\r\nnd thrill mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may feel for nakedness or intimacy may be broken dow=\r\nn. Overall, the person&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fascination and weakness for sex may be go=\r\nne largely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; Mind has a lot of conditioning based on prior experiences and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break down some of=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these structures by engaging in certain practices that undermine t=\r\nhose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; structures.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, is this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is al=\r\nso\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible that the person keeps on engaging in the practice merel=\r\ny for sex\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and thinks of sex everytime he sits for meditation (inste=\r\nad of thinking of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; meditation everytime he sees naked partner), if o=\r\nne was not serious/sincere/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ready to start with.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=82 =\r\n=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=\r\n=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 Bottomline is that an aghora ta=\r\nkes problems and weaknesses head\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on and sets up a high stakes fight=\r\n with them, whereas a normal person may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; push the problems under the=\r\n carpet and fight slowly and with low stakes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Such a risky strategy=\r\n is not applicable to all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=\r\n=82 =C3=82  *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 Like Manish said in a mail earlier, &quot;what is Vedanta and what =\r\nis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aghora&quot;? Aghora is merely a practical way to understand and abso=\r\nrb Vedanta\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in one&#39;s thought process, by setting up a high stakes wa=\r\nr plan. However, it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is certainly not suitable for all and many may =\r\nfeel aversion. More\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dangerously, some people may feel attraction fo=\r\nr it based on a wrong\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understanding and the thrill such an understa=\r\nnding brings.=C3=82 Aghora stands\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for neither thrills nor perversio=\r\nn, though it *may* attract some people\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pursuing thrills and/or perv=\r\nersion. The basic tenets of Aghora and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vedanta/Upanishads are the s=\r\name, but Aghora tries to accelerates how one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; absorbs the truth into=\r\n one&#39;s thinking by making failure very unpleasant.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; BTW, the following mail gives a =\r\ngood analogy for various spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; paths and explains the basic rea=\r\nlity.

For=C3=82 instance, Sri Muththuswamy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Disksh=\r\nitar, was a great composer (one of the Divine Trinity of Carnatic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; M=\r\nusic along with Thyagaraja and Shyama Sastry), who was a self-realized Sri\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vidyopasaka.

Anyway, your reply was a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ngreat one in which you mentioned how the Self is surrounded by layers of\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; duality!

However, from the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little I have been exposed to, Sree chakra=\r\n is a symblic representation of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the layers of duality surrounding S=\r\nelf. Its purpose, too, is to unravel the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; layer of duality and reali=\r\nze Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Lalita=\r\n means gentle one and Chandi means the fierce one. If you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have a mo=\r\nther who teaches you gently, you will learn slowly. If you have a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; m=\r\nother who is stern and strict, you will learn fast (provided you can face\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; the strictness).

You also wrote that it takes about 1.2=\r\n5 hours to 1.5 hours to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your chandi homam. How can you accomplis=\r\nh that feat with 700 ahutis in such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a short time? Also, in my case,=\r\n I do sandhyavandanam with 108 Gayatri (20\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; minutes)+ganapathi mantr=\r\na japam 108 times(10 minutes), a short rudra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Abhishekam with pachak=\r\nshari, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 minutes) totalling to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about 35 - 4=\r\n0 minutes daily ritual. Plus I sometimes do special rituals\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; several=\r\n times a week, that takes about 1 to 1.5 hours in all. How to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; integ=\r\nrate these along with homam? Is Sri vidyopasana different from Chandi\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; homam? Could you please explain what is sri Vidya and how it is to be\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; learnt? I am very motivated to learn what the Devi Mahatmayam is all =\r\nabout\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I also have keen interest in Sri Vidya, because I am a mu=\r\nsician also and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; learnt all the nava-avarna krithis of Great Muththu=\r\nswami Dikshitar recently.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Nagraj Kota\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
