My concern was not initiate unanticipated resul=\r\nts. I don&#39;t want to sit down with a lingering doubt/apprehension.\n   \n2) If=\r\n one practices this for deep concentration regularly for long, say an year =\r\nor more,as a side effect, there is some scope of developing disenchantment =\r\nand disinterest in worldly and family affairs leading to neglect/ignore Gri=\r\nhasta dharma duties. This seems to be the most likely reason for such a sta=\r\ntement.\nAs a Gruhasta, upaasana of a diety&#39;s mantra with devotion will even=\r\ntually take one to a state where pure Omkara upaasana can begin with confid=\r\nence.\n   \n3) If you are lucky enough to have a Guru and following him/her,\n=\r\n   and explicitly advised not to do , follow Guru&#39;s instructions.\n   Guru s=\r\npeaks based on either scriptures, parampara/tradition or the\n   disciple&#39;s =\r\ncurrent state of being. \n   It is like a toddler graduating from triCycle t=\r\no biCycle. \n   A Guru, like father, will let you practice triCycle until yo=\r\nu are matured enough for biCycle.\n\nI am not changing/forming/altering any o=\r\npinion on the said Pravachan karta based on this alone. Society gets immens=\r\ne intangible benefits with sincere scholar&#39;s preaching. At the least, they =\r\nkeep the belief in karma alive in our Conscience and make us spend a little=\r\n\nless time on meaningless, mind-polluting trash churned out by TV and Movie=\r\n media 24X7.\n\nBTW, I have one more reason for asking this question at this =\r\ntime.\nI have also read in a small article recently that Lord Siva has said\n=\r\nOmkaara upaasana on a Ardra+Chaturdasi day is extremely effective and\ngives=\r\n multiplied result ( reference - Siva Purana/Vidyeyswara S /chapter 10). La=\r\nzy and Greedy me would like spend a few moments doing this on this Tuesday,=\r\n Jan 14. Hope this info is correct and all readers here will benefit by spe=\r\nnding a few minutes on this upaasana on Tuesday.\n\nThank you all, especially=\r\n for Narasimaha ji, for your feedback and detailed explanations.\n\n\nregards,=\r\n\nRamesh\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, suryanarayanan viswanathan &lt;s=\r\nuryanarayanan_m@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Respected Members,\n&gt; As far as my knowledge=\r\n goes, during sandhyavandanam we say AUM ITHI EKAASHARAM BRAHMA.\n&gt; This mea=\r\nns AUM means parabrhman..\n&gt; Kindly offer ur esteemed opinions on this.\n&gt; Wi=\r\nth respectful regards,\n&gt; Sury\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Wednesday, 8 January 2014 12:00=\r\n PM, Sreenivasa Rao &lt;sreenivas_s@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Kumar,\n&gt; \n&gt; P=\r\nlease find my comments inline.=C2=A0 Due apologies if anything sounds\n&gt;    =\r\n   sharp or harsh,=C2=A0 there is no personal clash, its mere sharing\n&gt;    =\r\n   knowledge or information.

Rao wrote:  \n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;Namaste Sir,  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0=\r\n  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;I heard pravachanas by some of these popular religious teachers of I=\r\nndia like the gentleman you refer to. I appreciate them as they are serving=\r\n the cause of Sanatana Dharma to the best of their ability and there are a =\r\nhuge number of people who are in need of exactly that kind of service.  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;However, some genuine seekers may be misguided by some ill-d=\r\nigested, half-baked, un-nuanced and misunderstood knowledge coming from the=\r\nm.  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;Om is the essence of all mantras, just as Brahman (Se=\r\nlf) is the essence of the cosmos. In Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna says &quot;I am =\r\nOm among all mantras&quot;. Other mantras have specific attributes and qualities=\r\n. Even if one&#39;s mind abandons all other thoughts and obtains tadrupata with=\r\n mantra (i.e. merges in mantra), one experiences only a specific manifestat=\r\nion of Self. Om is nearly devoid of attributes and better-suited (though ne=\r\nither necessary not sufficient!) for merging in Self. That is why it is con=\r\nsidered the highest mantra and some highly elevated yogis meditate only wit=\r\nh Om.  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;Any teaching that meditation with Om is prohibited=\r\n for grihasthas may have originated from a fear that family will be in trou=\r\nble if one merges in Brahman. Three points are to be made here:  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;(1) Not everyone meditating with Om merges in Brahman anytime soo=\r\nn. In fact, most people on earth today are not going to do that anytime soo=\r\nn, irrespective of what mantra they use! They are burdened by too much cond=\r\nitioning and too many karmik debts..  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;(2) After becoming =\r\none with Self, one MAY come back and live as a liberated being (jeevanmukta=\r\n). One need not leave.  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;(3) If one has an unfulfilled kar=\r\nmik debt to anyone (including family), Nature will NOT let one leave anyway=\r\n. One will not be able to merge in Self despite best efforts, until debts a=\r\nre fulfilled.  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;If a grihastha indeed merges in Brahman wh=\r\nile meditating (with any mantra) and leaves, there was no karmik debt block=\r\ning him/her from it. So, why worry and try to prevent it? Nature will show =\r\nthe way to remaining family members based on their destiny and what they de=\r\nserve..  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;IMHO, there is no harm or danger in\n&gt;                   =\r\n            meditating with Om for anyone. All fears\n&gt;                     =\r\n          are based on focus on the superficial\n&gt;                          =\r\n     aspects of knowledge and half-baked and\n&gt;                             =\r\n  ill-nuanced understanding of its essence.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;If Om still scares you=\r\n, thanks to this\n&gt;                               gentleman, just pick some =\r\nother mantra,\n&gt;                               e.g. &quot;OM gaM gaNapataye namaH=\r\n&quot; or Shiva\n&gt;                               panchakshari or Vishnu&#39;s shadaks=\r\nhari or\n&gt;                               ashtakshari or dwadasakshari. Even =\r\nif one\n&gt;                               intends only Self-realization and no=\r\n\n&gt;                               attachment to any forms, still one need\n&gt; =\r\n                              not meditate with Om right away. One can\n&gt;   =\r\n                            start off with something else and it can\n&gt;     =\r\n                          lead to something else and finally Om at\n&gt;       =\r\n                        the right time.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Often, one leaves things t=\r\no Nature (or a\n&gt;                               guru if one has one), right =\r\nguidance comes\n&gt;                               at the right time.
