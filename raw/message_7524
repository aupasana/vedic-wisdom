This =\r\nlast line was a little difficult to comprehend. How can a human soul take a=\r\n birth directly in Kali-yuga for the first time?\n\nSome village pandits clai=\r\nm that they have the power to deliver a departed soul from taking an animal=\r\n birth. Is/was this ever possible -even by elevated Sages/Brahmins of the y=\r\nester-years?\n\nSir, I appreciate that you may have a very busy schedule so p=\r\nlease respond at your convenience. Many thanks.\n\nBest Regards,\nMahesh\n\n--- =\r\nIn vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nNamaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, human beings can be reborn as animals and vice ver=\r\nsa. Yoga \n&gt; Vasishtham (taught by Vasishtha to Lord Rama) has many specific=\r\n \n&gt; examples.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rebirth is not just a matter of being able to experience=\r\n some things. It \n&gt; is also a matter of giving back to those one has a rina=\r\n with. Depending \n&gt; on which beings one has a rina with and what kind of ri=\r\nnas (and how \n&gt; strong), one may have to be born along with those beings.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; If one killed animals and ate them, the only way to pay back may \n&gt; som=\r\netimes be to be reborn as an animal and be killed by those animals \n&gt; (rebo=\r\nrn as animals or human beings).\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me give a different kind of exampl=\r\ne. Suppose one had a very very \n&gt; strong and deep desire to mate with a bea=\r\nutiful girl and could not do it \n&gt; in that life. Suppose the girl&#39;s rinas g=\r\nive her rebirth as an animal. If \n&gt; one&#39;s punya allows him to fulfil that s=\r\ntrong desire in next birth, the \n&gt; strength of that desire may force him to=\r\n be reborn as an animal and he \n&gt; may fulfil the desire in that life as an =\r\nanimal. [Moral: Be careful what \n&gt; you strongly wish for!]\n&gt; \n&gt; The next bi=\r\nrth is decided by one&#39;s karmas, debts, and the karmas of \n&gt; people one has =\r\nstrong links to, one&#39;s deeply held desires and level of \n&gt; good deeds to fu=\r\nlfil those desires.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are so many situations that can force one to=\r\n be reborn as an \n&gt; animal. Animals reborn as human beings and human beings=\r\n reborn as \n&gt; animals is very common.\n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, a good percentage of hu=\r\nman beings on earth right now may be \n&gt; first time and last time (for now) =\r\nhuman beings!\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jy=\r\notish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for shor=\r\nt Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg\n&gt;       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;      =\r\n Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writ=\r\nings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;                      =\r\n Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Wed, Nov 23, 2011 at 1:39 AM, radha4krsna wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt; \n&gt;     Respected Mr. PVR Narasimha Rao,\n&gt; \n&gt; May I request YOUR view o=\r\nn the subject. Given you are very well read on \n&gt; both Dwaita and Adwaitya =\r\nphilosophy, what is your take on the subject.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can a human soul reincar=\r\nnate in a non-human body? And if so what is the \n&gt; rationale?\n&gt; \n&gt; PS: I am=\r\n aware of the reasoning in most vedic literature - e.g.\n&gt; a) To reap the fr=\r\nuits of past karmas\n&gt; b) The last thought carries the soul in the new body =\r\netc.\n&gt; \n&gt; The question, however, is that the Human mind & body is fully cap=\r\nable of \n&gt; experiencing all sufferings (as I am sure most would agree). Bes=\r\nides, \n&gt; vedic literature also gives elaborate description of the different=\r\n types \n&gt; of HELLS - where a paap-Atma suffers. What then necessitates a bi=\r\nrth in \n&gt; a non-human form.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is it possible that the vedic references o=\r\nf non-human births were just \n&gt; meant to be deterrents for those who are in=\r\ntellectually less elevated?\n&gt; \n&gt; Value your opinion. Others are welcome to =\r\nshare their views.\n&gt; Thank you for your time & attention.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; M=\r\nahesh\n&gt; \n&gt;   &lt;http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
