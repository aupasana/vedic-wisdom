Tha=\r\nt is the next stage of evolution. Sir Aurobindo uses a different set of ter=\r\nmonilogies based on his study of the Vedas and the Tattriya Upanishad. Ther=\r\nefore, when he says &quot;soul&quot; or other such words, they maynot=C2=A0 exactly m=\r\nean what we normally understand as the Atman - the eternal.\n=C2=A0\nThe core=\r\n of his philosophy is one of evolution. If Humans have to survive on this p=\r\nlanet, they must evolve and prove themselves worthy. Nature is too vast. We=\r\n live in one planet in one solar system in one milky way which is tucked aw=\r\nay in one corner of the universe. There are so many different elements in t=\r\nhe Universe, as well as different Universes, that compared to all that we a=\r\nre too tiny as a species. So why should nature have any special liking for =\r\nus? He says. Nature does not have any special liking or favouratism for hum=\r\nans as a species, untill humans can show that they have the capacity to evo=\r\nlve into a higher level=C2=A0and are worthy. Or else, Sri Aurobindo says, t=\r\nhere have been previous creation cycles which had human like species which =\r\nwere destroyed by Nature because they could not evolve. Nature is the Sover=\r\neign of ALL UNIVERSES. Therefore Nature&#39;s perspective is different from tha=\r\nt of an averge human.\n=C2=A0\nSo the purpose of life and an Avatar is to pus=\r\nh the species into higher realms of evolution. The next stage of evolution =\r\nis a spiritual one.

I am posting it here for anyone interested.\n=C2=A0\nNear the=\r\n beginning of the 20th century the great Indian freedom fighter and yogi-sa=\r\nge, Sri Aurobindo, began to express a truth which had not been expressed be=\r\nfore. In his high states of divine union he saw that the time had come for =\r\na new stage in the evolution of mankind. He saw that the divine was to mani=\r\nfest right here on Earth and that the time for this divine emergence into E=\r\narth life was now. He spoke of heaven descending to Earth, even as Earth ex=\r\nperienced a breakdown due to the intrinsic resistance held within her mater=\r\nial body towards this =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD\n=EF=BF=BD\nSri Aurobindo wa=\r\ns joined in Pondicherry, India, by a French mystic, Mirra Alfassa, who late=\r\nr became known as the Mother. Together they embarked on a journey of intens=\r\nive cellular transformation that is very relevant to the colossal uncertain=\r\nties we face today.\n=EF=BF=BD\nSri Aurobindo saw that the divine force perme=\r\nates all matter, and that all matter therefore has a force of consciousness=\r\n. The process of the divine spirit descending down into matter is called in=\r\nvolution. The process by which the divine ascends back upwards out of matte=\r\nr is called evolution. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a s=\r\ntage where these two events are occurring simultaneously, and in his inner =\r\nvisions, he foresaw that we would soon be experiencing a descent of what he=\r\n called =EF=BF=BDsupramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=BD that would=\r\n entirely change everything on Earth.\n=EF=BF=BD\nMan=EF=BF=BDs greatness is =\r\nnot in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in what he makes possible. An im=\r\nmortal soul is somewhere within him, even if seldom active in most people, =\r\nwhile an eternal spirit overshadows him, even if obstructed from descent by=\r\n the hard lid of his constructed personality. There is a great divine plan =\r\nin motion, even if the evidence of the outer senses seems to contradict it.=\r\n\n\nSri Aurobindo recognized that humankind is going through an evolutionary =\r\ncrisis. A stage has been reached in which the human mind has made tremendou=\r\ns strides on the one hand, but is left hopelessly inadequate to prevent its=\r\n own extinction as a species. Meanwhile, as the Mother testified before her=\r\n death in 1973, a consciousness higher than the human rational mind, what m=\r\nay be termed the Supermind, has recently been established in the fields of =\r\nthe Earth, and is active there. Our task now is to bring it down into cellu=\r\nlar consciousness.\n\nEvolution took a great leap forward with the origins of=\r\n Life, and later with the emergence of Mind. We are now at the threshold of=\r\n another leap forward, even more momentous, as we prepare for the emergence=\r\n of the Supermind. Sri Aurobindo speaks about four stages of human evolutio=\r\nn, which we will soon be starting to experience concurrently upon Earth. Th=\r\ne first is =EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current species, a rational =\r\nbeing possessing an individualized soul, but largely obstructed from contac=\r\nting and merging with it.\n=EF=BF=BD\nNext is the =EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=\r\n=BD a species that is spontaneous- ly coming to birth under the influence o=\r\nf an ever-expanding supramental field, a being that is largely able to merg=\r\ne and live from soul-consciousness rather than mind-consciousness. \n=C2=A0\n=\r\nThirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still inhabit a dense ph=\r\nysical body, but will be in possession of the Mind of Light, which is supra=\r\nmental consciousness that has begun to merge with cellular consciousness. \n=\r\n=C2=A0\nFinally, our ultimate goal as a species is the =EF=BF=BDSupramental =\r\nBeing,=EF=BF=BD divinity incarnated fully within the subtle realms of matte=\r\nr. This will be a race of what we could call =EF=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=\r\n=BF=BD In this species, the unity of matter and spirit would be fully reali=\r\nzed upon Earth.\n\nThe great work of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was in brin=\r\nging supramental consciousness down into the cellular consciousness of thei=\r\nr own bodies. Since this is a unified consciousness, this meant that the su=\r\npramental consciousness was simultaneously being brought into the conscious=\r\nness fields of the Earth, awaiting the moment when it would flower into its=\r\n full manifestation in collective matter.\nWhenever there is a =EF=BF=BDdesc=\r\nent=EF=BF=BD there is corresponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo and the Mothe=\r\nr speak of their experience with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD essenti=\r\nally anti-divine forces, at work in the world today. There is the Asura of =\r\nDarkness, the Asura of Suffering, The Asura of Falsehood, and the Asura of =\r\nDeath. These are the forces that are so outwardly apparent, and which seem =\r\nto be in control of current global events. According to them the Asura of D=\r\narkness (Lucifer?) has gone through a transformation recently, and the Asur=\r\na of Suffering has returned to Source, and so only the latter two still rem=\r\nain to wreak havoc on Earth. Interestingly, they spoke of the Asura of Fals=\r\nehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during World War II, and =\r\nof their own intensive inner work in countering his influence. It would not=\r\n be difficult to see how this same Asura may be influencing other world lea=\r\nders in the current political sphere.\n\nWith the descent of this new vibrato=\r\nry consciousness all our old obsolete human structures will be demolished. =\r\nHowever, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that although the changes will be enormou=\r\ns they would not be necessarily catastrophic. The power of Truth automatica=\r\nlly erases Falsehood, and our world for the most part consists of Falsehood=\r\n. Yet, the Supramental, he maintained, carried a power of harmonization whi=\r\nch could overcome this resistance by means other than dramatic struggle and=\r\n violence. The Asuras will eventually be absorbed into their original emana=\r\ntions of Light, Life, Beauty, and Truth. It may be interesting to speculate=\r\n, with all the violence in the world today, the destruction we might have e=\r\nxperienced if not for this power of harmonization!\n\nWhen does all this happ=\r\nen? Sri Aurobindo and the Mother believed that the world stage was set for =\r\nthis quantum descent, and that it was quite imminent. The Mother said in 19=\r\n68 that the supramental transformation was a certainty now, and that it wou=\r\nld come about with a minimum of destruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough this minimum=\r\n is still considerable.=EF=BF=BD She said that the year 2000 would be a tur=\r\nning point.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nThis was a very interesting read and matches what=\r\n Narasimhaji says about changes coming in the world.\n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0=\r\nRajarshi\n\n\n\n\nThe upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n\n\n\n\nI=\r\nCC World Twenty20 England &#39;09 exclusively on YAHOO!

Sir Aurobindo uses a different set of termonilogies based o=\r\nn his study of the Vedas and the Tattriya Upanishad.

If Humans have to survive on th=\r\nis planet, they must evolve and prove themselves worthy. Nature is too vast=\r\n. We live in one planet in one solar system in one milky way which is tucke=\r\nd away in one corner of the universe. There are so many different elements =\r\nin the Universe, as well as different Universes, that compared to all that =\r\nwe are too tiny as a species. So why should nature have any special liking =\r\nfor us? He says.

Or else, Sri Aurobindo say=\r\ns, there have been previous creation cycles which had human like species wh=\r\nich were destroyed by Nature because they could not evolve. Nature is the S=\r\novereign of ALL UNIVERSES. Therefore Nature&#39;s perspective is different from=\r\n that of an averge human.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;So the purpose of li=\r\nfe and an Avatar is to push the species into higher realms of evolution.

The first=\r\n is =EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current species, a rational being p=\r\nossessing an individualized soul, but largely obstructed from contacting an=\r\nd merging with it.&lt;BR&gt;=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;Next is the =EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=\r\n=BD a species that is spontaneous- ly coming to birth under the influence o=\r\nf an ever-expanding supramental field, a being that is largely able to merg=\r\ne and live from soul-consciousness rather than mind-consciousness. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Thirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will st=\r\nill inhabit a dense physical body, but will be in possession of the Mind of=\r\n Light, which is supramental consciousness that has begun to merge with cel=\r\nlular consciousness. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Finally, our ultimate go=\r\nal as a species is the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity incarn=\r\nated fully within the subtle realms of matter. This will be a race of what =\r\nwe could call =EF=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In this species, the uni=\r\nty of matter and spirit would be fully realized upon Earth.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\nThe great work of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was in bringing supramental =\r\nconsciousness down into the cellular consciousness of their own bodies. Sin=\r\nce this is a unified consciousness, this meant that the supramental conscio=\r\nusness was simultaneously being brought into the consciousness fields of th=\r\ne Earth, awaiting the moment when it would flower into its full manifestati=\r\non in collective matter.&lt;BR&gt;Whenever there is a =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD t=\r\nhere is corresponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo and the Mother speak of the=\r\nir experience with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD essentially anti-divi=\r\nne forces, at work in the world today. There is the Asura of Darkness, the =\r\nAsura of Suffering, The Asura of Falsehood, and the Asura of Death. These a=\r\nre the forces that are so outwardly apparent, and which seem to be in contr=\r\nol of current global events. According to them the Asura of Darkness (Lucif=\r\ner?) has gone through a transformation recently, and the Asura of Suffering=\r\n has\n returned to Source, and so only the latter two still remain to wreak =\r\nhavoc on Earth. Interestingly, they spoke of the Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=\r\n=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during World War II, and of their own=\r\n intensive inner work in countering his influence. It would not be difficul=\r\nt to see how this same Asura may be influencing other world leaders in the =\r\ncurrent political sphere.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;With the descent of this new vibra=\r\ntory consciousness all our old obsolete human structures will be demolished=\r\n. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that although the changes will be enorm=\r\nous they would not be necessarily catastrophic. The power of Truth automati=\r\ncally erases Falsehood, and our world for the most part consists of Falseho=\r\nod. Yet, the Supramental, he maintained, carried a power of harmonization w=\r\nhich could overcome this resistance by means other than dramatic struggle a=\r\nnd violence. The Asuras will eventually be absorbed into their original ema=\r\nnations of Light, Life, Beauty, and Truth. It may be interesting to specula=\r\nte, with all the violence in the world today, the destruction we might have=\r\n experienced if not for this power of harmonization!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;U&gt;When=\r\n does all this happen? Sri Aurobindo and the Mother believed that the world=\r\n stage was set for this quantum descent, and that it was quite imminent. Th=\r\ne Mother said in 1968 that the supramental transformation was a certainty n=\r\now, and that it would come about with a minimum of destruction, =EF=BF=BDal=\r\nthough this minimum is still considerable.=EF=BF=BD She said that the year =\r\n2000 would be a turning point.&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;=\r\n/U&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;This was a very interesting read and matches what Nara=\r\nsimhaji says about changes coming in the world.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;ST=\r\nRONG&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR:=\r\n navy; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DCourier color=3D#000000 size=3D3&gt;=\r\n&lt;FONT color=3D#00007f&gt;The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/F=\r\nONT&gt;- Shiva Sutra&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/T=\r\nR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;HR SIZE=3D1&gt;\nICC World Twenty20 England &#39;09 exclusi=\r\nvely on &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.rd.yahoo.com/tagline_cricket_3/*http://cricket=\r\n.yahoo.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;YAHOO!
