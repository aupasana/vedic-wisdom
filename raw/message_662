This list should also include saints from sufism and\n&gt; &gt; other reli=\r\ngions\n&gt; &gt; We have a good history and books to refer too but we donot have a=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; list of top 50 or so of living saints.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So I request you all to=\r\n contribute if you know and are impressed \nwith\n&gt; &gt; them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This woul=\r\nd be a good thing to have so that many of us can seek\n&gt; &gt; darshan and also =\r\nseek guidance in future.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The idea here is about quality and not so =\r\nmuch about quantity \nmeaning\n&gt; &gt; very reputed saints with thousands of disc=\r\niple are already \nwellknown,\n&gt; &gt; I would not mind having them in the list b=\r\nut more important is\n&gt; &gt; realized saints who have chosen to remain hidden o=\r\nr have shun\n&gt; &gt; publicity.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To Start of I shall start with a ver=\r\ny realized saint shri \nGanapathy\n&gt; &gt; Sacchianand Swamiji of Mysore, a livin=\r\ng Datta Avatar. He is the\n&gt; &gt; miracle man. I have had his darshan in US a f=\r\new times.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Once while I was on a pilgrimage to Pushkar about 8 years=\r\n ago, I \ndid\n&gt; &gt; visit a saint known as bengali baba, a very realzied saint=\r\n in his\n&gt; &gt; 90s. He is still alive and has built a very unique hanuman temp=\r\nle \nin\n&gt; &gt; Pushkar Rajasthan.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It was a very interesting meeting. He=\r\n spoke bengali only and I\n&gt; &gt; spoke hindi. He spoke for an hour. he underst=\r\nood all of what I \nsaid\n&gt; &gt; and asked and answered very sincerely in bengal=\r\ni in a very \npassionate\n&gt; &gt; way, however I could only understand 10% when t=\r\nhe translator was \nable\n&gt; &gt; to keep up with him.\n&gt; &gt; My idea  here is to fi=\r\nnd great saints in India who are also not\n&gt; &gt; wellknown as they may have ch=\r\nosen not to publize themselves too.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I thought about this because wh=\r\nile growing up, I missed a lot of\n&gt; &gt; oppurtunities to meet and seek darsha=\r\nn of many well known saints \nthat\n&gt; &gt; I am finding out now about their grea=\r\ntness. I feel like I missed \nmany\n&gt; &gt; boats and still remain on the same sh=\r\nore and waiting to cross the\n&gt; &gt; ocean.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hope to get this list going=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best Regards\n&gt; &gt; Mitesh\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
