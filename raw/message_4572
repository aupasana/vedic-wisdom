It is the op=\r\nposite of\n&gt; &gt; attachment( bandhana)- it does not mean dislike or aversion.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The Goddess Mahalakshmi- from the Sri Suktam and the Devi Mahatmyam=\r\n is not\n&gt; &gt; money- She is creation itself. She is consciousness.. The effec=\r\nt that you\n&gt; &gt; see may be due to wrong linkage of Her in your mind. She is =\r\nSri- prosperity\n&gt; &gt; and abundance- even renunciates do not say that they do=\r\n not want money or\n&gt; &gt; food( they may be indifferent to them- which is diff=\r\nerent from aversion).\n&gt; &gt; The thing is to be indifferent\n&gt; &gt; to it. Using b=\r\nhakti, we do not withdraw our consciousness forcefully as in\n&gt; &gt; some other=\r\n forms of yoga. We form an attachment to Her and that does all\n&gt; &gt; this and=\r\n more.A person who does true upasana will get detachment naturally.\n&gt; &gt; Use=\r\n the attitude of &#39;do as you will&#39; and surrender as your tools.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So c=\r\noming to the point- say &#39;I want YOU mother-whatever you give me is your\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n prasada.I will accept it.
