One \n&gt; =\r\nengages in them with no agendas, likes, dislikes, and attachments. Thus, \n&gt;=\r\n a jeevanmukta operates the previous identity till the momentum comes to \n&gt;=\r\n a screeching halt and then the body, senses, sensory mind, buddhi etc \n&gt; a=\r\nre returned to the original sources from which they were borrowed and \n&gt; ma=\r\nde sentient. But a jeevanmukta is free and unbound even while \n&gt; operating =\r\nwith an identity, for binding comes from the conditioning and \n&gt; not from i=\r\ndentification or actions. When the identity dissolves, it is \n&gt; not any bet=\r\nter or any extra freedom.\n&gt; \n&gt; Most likely, a jeevanmukta ceases to operate=\r\n an identity after some \n&gt; time, that time depending on the strength of pri=\r\nor momentum! It can be \n&gt; days or months or years or centuries or millennia=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nature sets such powerful momentum in place for some beings (e.g. \n&gt;=\r\n saptarshis, Vishnu, Shiva etc) that they may operate an identity for a \n&gt; =\r\nvery long time after conditioning drops off completely. It may even be \n&gt; f=\r\nor the entire duration of Creation. As a part of the momentum set in \n&gt; mot=\r\nion previously, one may even direct a part of one&#39;s ahamkara to \n&gt; identify=\r\n with a newly created identity (e.g. a new incarnation).

In other words, if there is no conditioning \n&gt; left, what pu=\r\nrpose a jeevan Mukta would serve in the objective world?\n&gt; \n&gt; I do nit know=\r\n if i was clear enough to explain what i want to ask you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; \n&gt; -=\r\n-- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &lt;/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yaho=\r\nogroups.com&gt; , Narasimha PVR Rao \n&gt; &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Namaste Man=\r\nish,\n&gt; &gt; I did actually answer you. I wasn&#39;t perhaps clear enough. Obviousl=\r\ny, \n&gt; &gt; these are not easy ideas to communicate in vaikhari (external \n&gt; &gt; =\r\ncommunication). I pray to Maharshi Vasishtha to imbibe something more \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthan vaikhari in the following words so that people can understand \n&gt; &gt; bet=\r\nter (not you Manish, the goal of answering your questions is \n&gt; &gt; obviously=\r\n not to impart any knowledge to YOU, but to perhaps benefit \n&gt; &gt; some other=\r\ns who may be ready - now or in future).\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; The pro=\r\nblem is not identification. The problem is *conditioning* \n&gt; &gt; (likes, disl=\r\nikes, wants, agendas etc) that drives the identification \n&gt; &gt; and use of wh=\r\nat one&#39;s ahamkara identifies with. If ahamkara \n&gt; &gt; (identification) evapor=\r\nates when chitta (conditioning) is cleaned up, \n&gt; &gt; it is normal mukti. If =\r\nahamkara (identification) remains while chitta \n&gt; &gt; (conditioning) is clean=\r\ned up, it is jeevanmukti. It is as simple as \n&gt; &gt; that.\n&gt; &gt; *        *     =\r\n   *\n&gt; &gt; If one engages in an action with zero conditioning, then there is =\r\nno \n&gt; &gt; karma and there are no rinas created. Actions (physical or mental) =\r\nby \n&gt; &gt; themselves do not bind one - it is the  *conditioned* actions that =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; bind one! It is the likes, dislikes, desires, agendas etc (i.e. \n&gt; &gt; c=\r\nonditioning in chitta) behind an action that bind one!\n&gt; &gt; *        *      =\r\n  *\n&gt; &gt; If somebody who is not YET a jeevanmukta (but close) identified wit=\r\nh a \n&gt; &gt; body and engaged in an action that IS driven by some conditioning,=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; however subtle or pure or dharmik that conditioning may be (!), then =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; that sets in motion the law of kaarmik action-reaction which will in \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; due time give a particular reaction to what one identified with when \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; engaging in that action.\n&gt; &gt; By the time the reaction is experienced, al=\r\nl the conditioning may be \n&gt; &gt; overcome and one may become jeevanmukta. Yet=\r\n, the momentum set in \n&gt; &gt; motion before one became jeevanmukta will contin=\r\nue to affect the body, \n&gt; &gt; senses and sensory mind, i.e. whatever one&#39;s ah=\r\namkara is identifying \n&gt; &gt; with. But, because there is no conditioning and =\r\nhence no agendas, no \n&gt; &gt; desires, no likes and dislikes, one neither rejoi=\r\nces nor protests nor \n&gt; &gt; tries to modify the happenings to what one is ide=\r\nntifying with.\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; Sensing that there is a pain req=\r\nuires no conditioning. It is the \n&gt; &gt; function of manas, i.e. Chandra. Obse=\r\nrving that there is more pain in \n&gt; &gt; the evening than morning (or when swa=\r\nllowing) requires no \n&gt; &gt; conditioning. It is the function of buddhi, i.e. =\r\nBudha. But thinking \n&gt; &gt; of praying to god to reduce pain requires conditio=\r\nning in chitta \n&gt; &gt; (absent in a jeevanmukta!).\n&gt; &gt; Though a jeevanmukta is=\r\n identifying with a body, one does not view it \n&gt; &gt; as something his own an=\r\nd something that must be kept in a particular \n&gt; &gt; state. He identifies wit=\r\nh it, but has no agendas for it. All that \n&gt; &gt; comes from conditioning in c=\r\nhitta, which is absent now!\n&gt; &gt; The unconditioned identifier (liberated I-n=\r\ness) views what one \n&gt; &gt; identifies with as an *amalgam* of portions borrow=\r\ned from various \n&gt; &gt; deities (pancha mahabhootas, Moon, Mercury, Indra, Mit=\r\nra, Varuna, Time \n&gt; &gt; etc) and hence as a manifestation of Light itself. On=\r\ne does not view \n&gt; &gt; it from the prism of &quot;this is me, I need to use it to =\r\npursue X or Y \n&gt; &gt; agenda.&quot; One views it as &quot;this is me. I am made of porti=\r\nons borrowed \n&gt; &gt; from various deities, i.e. various manifestations of Ligh=\r\nt. I observe \n&gt; &gt; their play, i.e. what they do, and I have no agenda pursu=\r\ne using \n&gt; &gt; them.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; This is the essence of Upanishads and Yoga Vaasisht=\r\nham, as well as \n&gt; &gt; Mantra Pushpam that we were discussing a while back.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; I repeat, identification is not the problem. It is the conditioning \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n that drives how one uses what one identifies with, that is the \n&gt; &gt; proble=\r\nm.\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; I now feel like I have expressed myself bett=\r\ner, though, given how \n&gt; &gt; subtle and nuanced this knowledge is, some peopl=\r\ne may still get \n&gt; &gt; confused (if so, please don&#39;t worry. Not a big deal. J=\r\nust keep doing \n&gt; &gt; sadhana, for that&#39;s the most important thing!). I am gr=\r\nateful to \n&gt; &gt; Manish and Maharshi Vasishtha for giving me this opportunity=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; BTW, whether Ramakrishna really got throat cancer because of his \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot;insult&quot; of Trilinga Swami or because he took the kaarmik power of \n&gt; &gt; at=\r\ntorney from Girish (a drunkard and womanizer at the time) can be \n&gt; &gt; debat=\r\ned. Strictly speaking, whether Ramakrishna really became a \n&gt; &gt; jeevanmukta=\r\n in that lifetime or not can also be debated.

The question was as I asked it. Why did \n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna get the =\r\naffliction (my question presumes, that he got it \n&gt; &gt; as a result of that i=\r\nnsult) If his mind did not identify with his \n&gt; &gt; body, 24/7,But instead wi=\r\nth Atma, then the karma would not have \n&gt; &gt; afflicted him, as there was no =\r\nidentification, so no karma (like \n&gt; &gt; Krishna) If it did afflict that body=\r\n, then it is obvious that there \n&gt; &gt; was good enough identification of mind=\r\n with body, that he could not \n&gt; &gt; escape the karmic result. That is the po=\r\nint. Not that he was oblivious \n&gt; &gt; to the suffering. And, we say that he w=\r\nas a Jeevanmukta. So how can \n&gt; &gt; that happen, if according to that definit=\r\nion, the mind must be \n&gt; &gt; identifying 24/7 with Atma to be qualified as a =\r\nJeevanmukta?\n&gt; &gt; The answer is straight forward.

Some portions of the Twitter exchange are quoted at \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the end=\r\n, in chronological order, in case someone is interested in the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; backgr=\r\nound. I will answer the following question posed by Manish \n&gt; &gt;&gt; based on m=\r\ny understanding: &lt;&lt;&lt;The question to my mind is this: was \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Ramakrishna =\r\na Jeevanmukta? If so, Why did he suffer with throat \n&gt; &gt;&gt; cancer if he was =\r\nnot identifying with his actions? (according to your \n&gt; &gt;&gt; interpretation o=\r\nf Vasistha&#39;s definition??)&gt;&gt;&gt; * =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82 * =C3=82  =\r\n=C3=82  =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82 * Let me elaborate on my understanding of jeeva=\r\nnmukti. Manish \n&gt; &gt;&gt; loosely (in my view) said in this exchange that rinas =\r\nare of body and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; a jeevanmukta continues to fulfil those rinas. But bo=\r\ndy is an \n&gt; &gt;&gt; insentient object. It has no rinas. The rinas are not of the=\r\n body, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; but of the mind that identifies with it. It is the antahkarana=\r\ns of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; mind - ahamkara (I-ness) and chitta (memory/conditioning) - that=\r\n are \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the source of various rinas, particularly chitta. As mind identi=\r\nfies \n&gt; &gt;&gt; with a body, it projects its rinas on the body and makes the bod=\r\ny \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;do&quot; things, in accordance with those \n&gt; &gt;&gt; rinas/=\r\nconditioning. If the conditioning in chitta is completely wiped \n&gt; &gt;&gt; out a=\r\nnd ahamkara merges in Self, then it is mukti. But, if the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; conditionin=\r\ng in chitta is completely wiped out and yet ahamkara \n&gt; &gt;&gt; continues to exi=\r\nst with no limiting notions (it is basically the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chit=\r\nta that is limiting), then one becomes \n&gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta (liberated while l=\r\niving). Unlike in the case of one who \n&gt; &gt;&gt; leaves body and gets mukti, a j=\r\neevanmukta continues to have an I-ness \n&gt; &gt;&gt; (but which is not limited by a=\r\nny notions or conditioning). This \n&gt; &gt;&gt; unconditioned I-ness does project i=\r\nnto a body. But it does not say &quot;I \n&gt; &gt;&gt; am this body and hence this body s=\r\nhould be kept healthy or strong&quot; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; (THAT would be conditioning in chitt=\r\na, which is wiped out now!). On \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the other hand, it does not either sa=\r\ny &quot;this body should be ignored \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and destroyed&quot;. Though conditioning is=\r\n absent now, body keeps \n&gt; &gt;&gt; experiencing and doing things based on the *m=\r\nomentum* set in motion \n&gt; &gt;&gt; before one became jeevanmukta and engaged in c=\r\nonditioned experiences \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and actions. This is like a fan turning for a =\r\nwhile after the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; electricity has been stopped. Manas, buddhi and indri=\r\nyas keep working \n&gt; &gt;&gt; as they did before. If one has throat cancer, indriy=\r\nas may sense \n&gt; &gt;&gt; pain. Manas (sensory/motor mind) may process that input =\r\nand register \n&gt; &gt;&gt; pain. Buddhi may analyze various observations and draw v=\r\narious \n&gt; &gt;&gt; conclusions (e.g. &quot;when I gulp or try to swallow food, it hurt=\r\ns even \n&gt; &gt;&gt; more&quot;, &quot;when I take so and so herbal liquid, it feels better&quot; =\r\netc). A \n&gt; &gt;&gt; normal person whose conditioned mind (chitta) says &quot;I should =\r\novercome \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and not have this pain&quot; may think of various things to do an=\r\nd \n&gt; &gt;&gt; struggle with them. But an unconditioned being has no such \n&gt; &gt;&gt; co=\r\nnsiderations. Though one may feel and express the pain and other \n&gt; &gt;&gt; obje=\r\nctive experiences, one reacts to it differently. * =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82  =\r\n=C3=82 * =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82 * This is a key point: Manas a=\r\nnd buddhi are good at making \n&gt; &gt;&gt; objective observations and rational dedu=\r\nctions, but, by themselves, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; they do not have ANY agenda. They neither=\r\n like something nor dislike \n&gt; &gt;&gt; something. THAT comes from the conditioni=\r\nng in chitta! The hallmark \n&gt; &gt;&gt; of a jeevanmukta is that THAT is absent! *=\r\n =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82 * =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82 * \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Wh=\r\nether Ramakrishna was a jeevanmukta is a moot question. A better \n&gt; &gt;&gt; way =\r\nto express your question is: Can a jeevanmukta get throat cancer \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and =\r\nfeel pain? How is it possible if there are no karmas or rinas \n&gt; &gt;&gt; left? I=\r\n have already answered it. But, let me sum it up briefly \n&gt; &gt;&gt; again. Body,=\r\n various body parts, jnanendriyas, karmendiyas, manas and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; buddhi of a=\r\n jeevanmukta continue to operate as before. One&#39;s I-ness \n&gt; &gt;&gt; is intact an=\r\nd does project itself onto those. But neither I-ness nor \n&gt; &gt;&gt; those things=\r\n carry any rinas or karmas. Chitta - the repository of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning a=\r\nnd rinas - is clean. There are no limiting notions. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; One&#39;s body, indri=\r\nyas, manas & buddhi keep experiencing and doing \n&gt; &gt;&gt; things (good or bad!)=\r\n based on the previous momentum set by the play \n&gt; &gt;&gt; of rnas and karmas wh=\r\nile some conditioning was left in chitta. Body, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; various body parts, i=\r\nndriyas of jnana and karma and manas are all \n&gt; &gt;&gt; portions borrowed from v=\r\narious deities. Ahamkara (I-ness) infuses \n&gt; &gt;&gt; sentience into them by proj=\r\necting awareness into them. The \n&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta is what drives=\r\n how all these are viewed and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; used. Instead of looking at a sense org=\r\nan as a portion of Indra or \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Mitra, one views it as &quot;my so and so sens=\r\ne organ&quot;, due to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta. That is what creates karmas =\r\nand rinas. When \n&gt; &gt;&gt; that conditioning is *completely* overcome, ahamkara =\r\ncan still \n&gt; &gt;&gt; project awareness into those objects, but it sees them for =\r\nwhat they \n&gt; &gt;&gt; are. It does not have false and limiting notions like &quot;this=\r\n throat is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; mine and MUST feel nice and not feel painful&quot;. * =C3=82  =\r\n=C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82 * =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82 * Most people =\r\nwho may claim to be (or think they are) jeevanmuktas \n&gt; &gt;&gt; are not really j=\r\neevanmuktas in today&#39;s world. If one wants to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; understand the state of=\r\n jeevanmukti, Yoga Vaasishtham is the best \n&gt; &gt;&gt; book. The entire discourse=\r\n by Maharshi Vasishtha to Lord Rama is a \n&gt; &gt;&gt; detailed and elaborate defin=\r\nition and characterization of a \n&gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta. There may be other books=\r\n that explain better how to do \n&gt; &gt;&gt; various sadhanas to progress spiritual=\r\nly and get closer to being \n&gt; &gt;&gt; liberated oneday. But, when it comes elabo=\r\nrating what liberation \n&gt; &gt;&gt; while living actually is, there is none better=\r\n than Yoga Vaasishtham. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, one can say that this is merely an=\r\n intellectual exercise \n&gt; &gt;&gt; as far as *we* are concerned. It perhaps is, a=\r\ns none of may ever \n&gt; &gt;&gt; become a jeevanmukta.. One word of caution: I writ=\r\ne with a very \n&gt; &gt;&gt; confident tone when I have strong conviction in what I =\r\nwrite. That is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; how I am. But I can definitely be wrong. So please fee=\r\nl free to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; ignore me! :-) Happy Shivaratri (tomorrow night) to all!

Nothing really, fulfilling all rnas, wa=\r\nit for \n&gt; &gt;&gt; rnas to be over. Narasimha: If a &quot;jeevanmukta&quot; fails in &quot;fulfi=\r\nlling \n&gt; &gt;&gt; all rnas&quot;, will he b bound again? If no, y r they called rnas? =\r\nIf \n&gt; &gt;&gt; yes, y call him mukta? Manish: No, rnas will work out themselves, =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; slowly or fast as may be the case. The rnas are of the body he or she=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; occupies. He is mukta because he experiences, actually sees the rnas=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; to be the body&#39;s only. Rnas apply to the body, not to you. You are \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that &quot;speck of effulgent light&quot;, call it what you want, Atma, etc. \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha: Well, that speck of effulgent light was never bound. So, \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; who exactly bcame &quot;mukta&quot;? Did & does he/it have rnas? If these &quot;rnas \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; of body&quot; r somehow not fulfilled after one bcomes jeevanmukta, what \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; happens to one? :-) Manish: You are right. The mind thought, that, it \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; was the body, instead of this light. That is the original problem. \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n Which every being is born with. Rnas arise from this identification \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nwhich creates karma. U r not that, so u r not bound, when the mind \n&gt; &gt;&gt; re=\r\nalises this. Became &quot;Mukta&quot; is also not quite true, since u r that \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;L=\r\night&quot; frm d beginning Narasimha: Then, r the rnas of the &quot;body&quot; as \n&gt; &gt;&gt; u =\r\nsaid r of the mind? When a mind identifies with light & bcomes \n&gt; &gt;&gt; mukta,=\r\n does it hv rnas left? Manish: Ok, karmas projected into mind, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; are ac=\r\nted on and may be experienced by body. So, why is a jeevanmukta \n&gt; &gt;&gt; subje=\r\nct to this? because, that person although aware of the light at \n&gt; &gt;&gt; all t=\r\nimes, and of the causal n subtle bodies, has not yet directed d \n&gt; &gt;&gt; mind =\r\nto identify as that light at all times, key word being &quot;all&quot;. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; This gi=\r\nves karmas time to work. Next stage is 24/7 id with light \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: =\r\nAs per my understanding, the person u r defining is not a \n&gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta=\r\n. He may b an elevated being, but not mukta (liberated) \n&gt; &gt;&gt; yet. Manish: =\r\nI derive that definition of this &quot;state&quot; from somebody, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; no problem in=\r\n disagreement. 24/7 identification with light, most \n&gt; &gt;&gt; likely body shoul=\r\nd not exist, no? Narasimha: Id with light forever \n&gt; &gt;&gt; with body dropping =\r\noff is just mukti, not jivanmukti! Jivanmukti is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; where body stays. Is=\r\n body really different from light? In fact, is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; there anything other t=\r\nhan light? Jivanmukti is seeing the play of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; objects but seeing all as=\r\n light. Mukti & rna are contradictory \n&gt; &gt;&gt; concepts & cant coexist. U rnt =\r\n&quot;free&quot; till u pay back what u owe. And \n&gt; &gt;&gt; that means u dont owe anybody =\r\nanything once u r truly free. Words \n&gt; &gt;&gt; like free, liberated & jivanmukta=\r\n r often misused. Manish: Will \n&gt; &gt;&gt; explain a bit in detail sometime. Nara=\r\nsimha: OK. :-) But, as far as \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;explaining&quot; is concerned, Vasishtha ex=\r\nplained as clearly & \n&gt; &gt;&gt; elaborately as any human being can ever hope 2. =\r\nManish: The question \n&gt; &gt;&gt; to my mind is this: was Ramakrishna a Jeevanmukt=\r\na? If so, Why did he \n&gt; &gt;&gt; suffer with throat cancer if he was not identify=\r\ning with his actions? \n&gt; &gt;&gt; (according to your interpretation of Vasistha&#39;s=\r\n definition??) \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: Vasishtha didnt give a single definition. H=\r\nis entire \n&gt; &gt;&gt; discourse 2 Rama is a definition of jeevanmukta! Will answe=\r\nr ur RK qn \n&gt; &gt;&gt; later.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;   &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWr=\r\nitings&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
