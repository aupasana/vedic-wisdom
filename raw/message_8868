As far as I understand the dri=\r\ned coconut meat is the part of coconut which is used for homam. Also, I am =\r\nunaware of there being any ban on the outer shell of coconut, as all parts =\r\nof coconut are available at the local supermarkets, and the dried coconuts =\r\nbeing available at the local Indian markets. As far as other alternatives t=\r\no coconuts are concerned, the wood from the oak trees burns hot and clean p=\r\nroducing a minimum of smoke. There are many ways to deal with the problem o=\r\nf smoke if you are living in a apartment or flat. And it depends on how muc=\r\nh you want to spend on fans and ducts to draw the smoke outside of the apar=\r\ntment, so as to reduce the likelihood of smoke damage to the walls and pain=\r\nted surfaces. Hope this helps you get started again. Warm Regards Ajaya ---=\r\n In mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com, Anup Ray=C2=A0 wrote: Namaste Al=\r\nl,=C2=A0=C2=A0 I&#39;d a very fundamental query.
