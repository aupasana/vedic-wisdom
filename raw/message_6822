The duty of a grihastha is quite unconcerned with the du=\r\nty of the other three. Similar is the case with the vanaprastha and the san=\r\nnyasin. One has nothing to do with the works of the other. The brahmachari =\r\nstudies the samhita portion of the Vedas as swadhyaya.The grihastha perform=\r\ns action according to the brahmana portion of the Vedas. The vanaprastha le=\r\nads a mystic and secluded life according to the sylvan text or the aranyaka=\r\n portion of the Vedas. The sannyasin contemplates according to the upanisha=\r\ndic or knowledge portion of the Vedas. \n\n\n"}}
