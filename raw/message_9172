When a\nhighly purified mind=\r\n makes offerings internally, it is possible for it to be\nhighly focused on =\r\nthe visualization. That can indeed be more effective.\n \nHowever, until one =\r\nreaches such a stage, it is quite useful (and often\nunavoidable) to engage =\r\nin external and material offerings. A mind that is\nunfocused and distracted=\r\n needs some objects and actions to anchor it and\nmake it somewhat focused a=\r\nnd disciplined.\n\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & Spiritualit=\r\ny Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org=\r\n/&gt; \n--------\n \n\n________________________________\n\n\tFrom: monkeymonkeyking10=\r\n &lt;monkeymonkeyking10@...&gt;\n\tTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n\tSent: T=\r\nhursday, April 11, 2013 10:07 AM\n\tSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Manas Puja\n\t\n\n\t  =\r\n\n\tNamaste to All,\n\t\n\tI have recently heard it said that offerings made &#39;men=\r\ntally&#39; can be\nsuperior/more effective in manifesting desired results than a=\r\nctual material\nofferings.
