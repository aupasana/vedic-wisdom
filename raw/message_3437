I am from AP, where there is a tradition of putting=\r\n the &#39;Bommala Kolu&#39; for Makara Sankranthi, just like tamils do it during th=\r\ne Dussera. I was surprised to know that many people are avoiding putting th=\r\ne &#39;Kolu&#39; this year because of eclipse. I am wondering if this is reasonable=\r\n enough! On one hand we hear that it is good to do japam, homam during ecli=\r\npse and on the other hand, they attribute some evil effects to eclipses, wh=\r\ny? Sri Narasimha Garu or others, please explain.\n\nNagraj\n\n\n"}}
