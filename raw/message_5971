In respect of the\nd=\r\nream-world that is being seen by those drowsy with ignorance of the Self,\nh=\r\ne is asleep.\n\n36 Hence it is said that this world is as night to the sage, =\r\nwhereas to the\nignorant the real Self is as night. For this reason the natu=\r\nral state, the\nfourth state is described by the sages as a state of waking =\r\nsleep.\n\nThis distinction between the sage and the ignorant finds a place in=\r\n the\nfollowing verse of the Gita: =E2=80=98The sage is awake in what is nig=\r\nht to all\ncreatures. That in which the creatures are awake is night to the =\r\nsage,\nthough he is, in fact, awake.=E2=80=99\n\nThis implies that from the st=\r\nandpoint of the sage, the world is unreal. This\nverse suggests a question: =\r\nhow the sage, whose body is still alive, can\ncarry on his mission as a teac=\r\nher of supreme wisdom. The solution to this\nriddle lies in the fact that th=\r\ne natural state of a sage does not interfere\nwith the sage=E2=80=99s work a=\r\ns a teacher. That activity goes on in a mysterious\nway, which is explained =\r\nto the extent possible in a later context.\n\nFrom all this it might appear t=\r\nhat sagehood is something anomalous. What is\nanomalous is the worldly outlo=\r\nok, which is blind to the real and attentive\nto the unreal dream, the world=\r\n-appearance. The worldly ones are just like\nintoxicated or mad people. It i=\r\ns the sage who is both sober and sane.\n\nUp to now the supreme state of the =\r\nsage has been called the fourth state.\nBut this name is only a concession t=\r\no novices, as is shown presently.\n\n37 For those to whom the three states, w=\r\naking and the rest, are real, that\n[supreme] state is mentioned as =E2=80=\r\n=98the fourth state=E2=80=99. But since that so-called\nfourth state alone i=\r\ns real, and these three are unreal, the term =E2=80=98fourth\nstate=E2=80=99=\r\n is not rightly applicable to it.\n\nThe supreme state is therefore just the =\r\ntranscendental state. When compared\nto this state, the three worldly states=\r\n cannot be considered to be real.\nTheir seeming reality is no more authenti=\r\nc than the reality that is ascribed\nto a dream while it lasts. This point w=\r\nill be further elaborated later.\n\nThe cause of the difference between the t=\r\nhree states and the supreme state\nis explained next.\n\n38 In dream and wakin=\r\ng, the mind, being active, itself creates the world. In\ndeep sleep it goes =\r\ninto seed form; on awaking it again creates the world.\n\nIn deep sleep the m=\r\nind is not completely lost; it goes into a latent state,\nout of which it ca=\r\nn emerge and become active again as before. This is the\nreason for the cont=\r\ninuance of bondage. Thus, these three states form a\nvicious circle that can=\r\n be broken only by finally extinguishing the mind so\nthat it cannot revive =\r\non awaking.\n\nTo reach this goal the mind-free state must be attained in the=\r\n waking state\nitself since the other two states are useless for this purpos=\r\ne.\n\n39 Unless and until the mind becomes utterly extinct, these three state=\r\ns\nwill continue to prevail. When the mind becomes extinguished, the supreme=\r\n\nstate, in which this world once and for all ceases to appear [as real], is=\r\n\nwon.\n\nDuring the prevalence of ignorance the three states conceal the supr=\r\neme\nstate. The latter cannot be experienced because of these. To be able to=\r\n\nexperience that state the mind must be destroyed so that the world-creatio=\r\nn\nwill also cease. To this end, the quest must be taken up and pursued unti=\r\nl\nthe mind-free state is established.\n\nThis is often styled the state of kn=\r\nowledge. But this description is\nmisleading for the reason stated presently=\r\n.\n\n40 Though that state of being the real Self is called the state of\nknowl=\r\nedge, it is one in which there is none of the three: the knower, the\nobject=\r\n known, and the act of knowing. That being the case, what does one\nknow the=\r\nre, by what means, and who is there to know? It must be understood\nthat kno=\r\nwledge is just a name for the state of being the Self.\n\nThat state is diffe=\r\nrent from anything else because it is a state of\nnon-duality (advaita). The=\r\nre is no object to be known, nor is there a knower\n=E2=80=93 the soul =E2=\r\n=80=93 and hence there is no knowing. So =E2=80=98knowledge=E2=80=99 or =E2=\r\n=80=98awareness=E2=80=99\nare just arbitrary names for this state. This will=\r\n be explained later.\n\n41 The upanishadic text that says: =E2=80=98Where the=\r\n Self is all there is, how and\nwhat does one know there?=E2=80=99 makes it =\r\nclear that in the supreme state the real\nSelf is alone [as the one without =\r\na second].\n\nA possible misconception is next pointed out and the true state=\r\n clearly\nexplained.\n\n42 In that state there is not, in reality, even the di=\r\nfference of place and\nthe occupant thereof. Since the Self, the all-inclusi=\r\nve reality, is one\nwithout a second, he, the Supreme Being, is his own plac=\r\ne.\n\nThis is an echo of the upanishadic passage =E2=80=93 =E2=80=98He abides=\r\n in his own\ngreatness, or rather, not even in that greatness=E2=80=99 =E2=\r\n=80=93 given to Narada by Guru\nSanat Kumara. This means that the real Self =\r\nis not in space.\n\nWho then is the advaitin?\n\n43 Since the sage has put an e=\r\nnd to all duality by attaining the supreme\nstate, the real state, he has th=\r\nerefore attained the advaitic state. Hence,\nhe alone should be regarded as =\r\nan advaitin.\n\nThis is important. Bhagavan has warned us against thinking of=\r\n advaita as a\ndoctrine, just like the doctrines of the sectarians. Since th=\r\ne advaitic\nstate is the mind-free state, there is no room in it for doctrin=\r\nes. This is\nfurther explained as follows.\n\n44 Duality comes to be taken as =\r\nreal because of taking something that is not\nthe Self to be the Self. The s=\r\nages tell us that the state of being free from\nthis ignorance is itself the=\r\n advaitic state.\n\nThis means that so long as this ignorance endures, the ad=\r\nvaitic state is not\nattained.\n\n45 Thus, advaita is not a dogma like those o=\r\nf the other religions. Also,\nbecause the mind does not function in it, true=\r\n advaita is declared to be\njust the state of being in one=E2=80=99s own rea=\r\nl nature [as the real Self], free\nfrom thoughts and worldless.\n\nIt must be =\r\nremembered that the world can never be without the mind. For this\nreason a =\r\nmerely theoretical =E2=80=93 intellectual =E2=80=93 belief in advaita is of=\r\n no\nvalue whatever.\n\n46 On the other hand, the advaitic state has not been =\r\nattained by one who,\nknowing the substance of the sacred lore as a doctrine=\r\n, by his intellect\nalone, is satisfied with it, without striving to win act=\r\nual experience of\nthe real Self.\n\nThis is explained in detail as follows:\n\n=\r\n47 Such a one has not dissolved the world-appearance by remaining in the\ntr=\r\nue state of the Self as the supreme reality. He that knows the Self by\nunde=\r\nrstanding the substance of the books has not got rid of his false notion\nth=\r\nat the body is the Self!\n\nIdentification of the body as the Self is the pri=\r\nmary ignorance, and\ntheoretical knowledge has not the least effect on that =\r\nignorance. It\nsurvives. It ceases only by the attainment of the true state =\r\nof the Self.\n\n48 It has been stated by the Guru Sankara that such a one is =\r\nreally not\ndifferent from the brute animals. Brute-hood is defined by the s=\r\nages as that\nstate in which one regards the Self as being limited to the bo=\r\ndy.\n\n49 Hence, for him who just knows the sacred lore, the belief that the =\r\nworld\nis real as such [in its own sight] does not cease. Deluded by this fa=\r\nlse\nbelief, he, like all the rest, ever wanders helplessly in samsara.\n\n50 =\r\nIt is said [by Bhagavan] that the knower of the sacred lore whose mind\nhas =\r\nnot subsided in the peace [of the supreme state] is just like a\ngramophone.=\r\n It is also said [by Bhagavan] that he is even worse off than the\nman witho=\r\nut learning, because, unlike the latter, he is overwhelmed by moods\nof prid=\r\ne, and so on.\n\nIn Ulladu Narpadu Anubandham Bhagavan has stated: =E2=80=98A=\r\n sincere and wide-awake\naspirant may even bewail the barrenness of result o=\r\nf his theoretical\nknowledge saying: =E2=80=9COh! The illiterate ones are be=\r\ntter off than I am!=E2=80=9D=E2=80=99\n\nSuch lamentations abound in the writ=\r\nings of the great saint Thayumanavar.\nIndeed, as shown below, this theoreti=\r\ncal conviction is only belief, not\nknowledge.\n\n51 This [theoretical] knowle=\r\ndge is styled =E2=80=98inferential knowledge=E2=80=99, [as of a\nthing absen=\r\nt]. But the Self is never absent. How can inferential knowledge\nof one that=\r\n is ever-present be true knowledge?\n\nLogicians distinguish between knowledg=\r\ne that is either direct or\ninferential. The former pertains to objects perc=\r\neived by the senses and the\nlatter to objects not so perceived, but only in=\r\nferred. But for the reason\nstated in this verse, there can be only direct [=\r\nexperiential] knowledge of\nthe Self, and hence the Self is never the subjec=\r\nt matter of inference.\nDescartes=E2=80=99 famous proposition, =E2=80=98I th=\r\nink, therefore I am=E2=80=99, is unsound for\nthis reason. The Self shines b=\r\ny its own light of consciousness, and not by\nany other light.\n\nAlso, knowle=\r\ndge by sense perceptions is not really direct, that is,\nimmediate, but only=\r\n functions through a medium, a sense organ. The Self,\nbeing consciousness, =\r\nneeds no medium.\n\n52 The ignorance-causing bondage is just the [mistaken] e=\r\nxperience that\ntakes the form =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99. How can such=\r\n ignorance come to an end except\nby the awareness, =E2=80=98I am the pure c=\r\nonsciousness=E2=80=99?\n\nIllusory experience can cease only by the illusion-=\r\nfree experience. That is\nthe reason why learned men still remain in ignoran=\r\nce and bondage.\n\n53 This theoretical knowledge is only intellectual. But th=\r\ne intellect has no\naccess to the real Self. Just as evil spirits are [ironi=\r\ncally] styled as\n=E2=80=98good people=E2=80=99, so this ignorance is styled=\r\n =E2=80=98knowledge=E2=80=99.\n\nIn Sanskrit literature the term =E2=80=98goo=\r\nd people=E2=80=99 is used ironically to\ndesignate evil spirits, the asuras =\r\nor rakshasas.\n\n54 When a man scorched by the sun becomes cooled by bathing =\r\nin a mirage, or\nwhen one succeeds in cooking food on a painting of a fire, =\r\nthen one may\nattain deliverance by theoretical knowledge.\n\nThus, emphatical=\r\nly, the notion that theoretical knowledge is knowledge is\ndenounced.\n\n55 Th=\r\nerefore, one who talks advaita without actual experience of that truth\nis j=\r\nust the same as a dvaitin [a dualist]. Neither speech nor mind has any\nacce=\r\nss to that supreme state. He that abides in that state has no doctrine\nwhat=\r\never.\n\nDoctrines, more or less true, are of help to the aspirant. They do n=\r\not\nsurvive in the state of deliverance (illumination). The sage does not =\r\n=E2=80=98know=E2=80=99\nthe Self, because he is the Self.\n\nThis equation of =\r\nhim who has only theoretical knowledge with the dvaitin is\njustified as fol=\r\nlows:\n\n56 Those who think of themselves as advaitins say [from intellectual=\r\n\nconviction alone] that the world is unreal, miserable and inert\n[unconscio=\r\nus]. Others [professing dvaitins] say otherwise. But in the result\nall are =\r\nalike.\n\nThat is, all are in bondage and suffer the evils of samsara. They a=\r\nll act as\nif the world were real.\n\nSource: http://www.davidgodman.org/rteac=\r\nh/rpv_intro.shtml\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=\r\n=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=\r\n=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd25cae91ccf7049ebb63f6\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n35 The sage is wide-awake, having become established in the true=\r\n state of the Self, which is free from the darkness of ignorance.

Also, because the mind does not functi=\r\non in it, true advaita is declared to be just the state of being in one=E2=\r\n=80=99s own real nature [as the real Self], free from thoughts and worldles=\r\ns.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It must be remembered that the world can never be without the m=\r\nind. For this reason a merely theoretical =E2=80=93 intellectual =E2=80=93 =\r\nbelief in advaita is of no value whatever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;46 On the other hand, the=\r\n advaitic state has not been attained by one who, knowing the substance of =\r\nthe sacred lore as a doctrine, by his intellect alone, is satisfied with it=\r\n, without striving to win actual experience of the real Self.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This=\r\n is explained in detail as follows:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;47 Such a one has not dissolved =\r\nthe world-appearance by remaining in the true state of the Self as the supr=\r\neme reality. He that knows the Self by understanding the substance of the b=\r\nooks has not got rid of his false notion that the body is the Self!&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Identification of the body as the Self i=\r\ns the primary ignorance, and theoretical knowledge has not the least effect=\r\n on that ignorance. It survives. It ceases only by the attainment of the tr=\r\nue state of the Self.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;48 It has been stated by the Guru San=\r\nkara that such a one is really not different from the brute animals. Brute-=\r\nhood is defined by the sages as that state in which one regards the Self as=\r\n being limited to the body.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;49 Hence, for him who just knows the s=\r\nacred lore, the belief that the world is real as such [in its own sight] do=\r\nes not cease. Deluded by this false belief, he, like all the rest, ever wan=\r\nders helplessly in samsara.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;50 It is said [by Bhagavan] that the k=\r\nnower of the sacred lore whose mind has not subsided in the peace [of the s=\r\nupreme state] is just like a gramophone.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bo=\r\nld&quot;&gt;It is also said [by Bhagavan] that he is even worse off than the man wi=\r\nthout learning, because, unlike the latter, he is overwhelmed by moods of p=\r\nride, and so on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;In Ulladu Narpadu Anubandham Bhagavan has =\r\nstated: =E2=80=98A sincere and wide-awake aspirant may even bewail the barr=\r\nenness of result of his theoretical knowledge saying: =E2=80=9COh! The illi=\r\nterate ones are better off than I am!=E2=80=9D=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Such lamen=\r\ntations abound in the writings of the great saint Thayumanavar.&lt;br&gt;Indeed, =\r\nas shown below, this theoretical conviction is only belief, not knowledge.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;51 This [theoretical] knowledge is styled =E2=80=98inferential knowl=\r\nedge=E2=80=99, [as of a thing absent]. But the Self is never absent. How ca=\r\nn inferential knowledge of one that is ever-present be true knowledge?&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;Logicians distinguish between knowledge that is either direct or infer=\r\nential. The former pertains to objects perceived by the senses and the latt=\r\ner to objects not so perceived, but only inferred. But for the reason state=\r\nd in this verse, there can be only direct [experiential] knowledge of the S=\r\nelf, and hence the Self is never the subject matter of inference. Descartes=\r\n=E2=80=99 famous proposition, =E2=80=98I think, therefore I am=E2=80=99, is=\r\n unsound for this reason. The Self shines by its own light of consciousness=\r\n, and not by any other light.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Also, knowledge by sense perceptions=\r\n is not really direct, that is, immediate, but only functions through a med=\r\nium, a sense organ. The Self, being consciousness, needs no medium.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n52 The ignorance-causing bondage is just the [mistaken] experience that tak=\r\nes the form =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99. How can such ignorance come to=\r\n an end except by the awareness, =E2=80=98I am the pure consciousness=E2=80=\r\n=99?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Illusory experience can cease only by the illusion-free exper=\r\nience. That is the reason why learned men still remain in ignorance and bon=\r\ndage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;53 This theoretical knowledge is only intellectual. But the in=\r\ntellect has no access to the real Self. Just as evil spirits are [ironicall=\r\ny] styled as =E2=80=98good people=E2=80=99, so this ignorance is styled =E2=\r\n=80=98knowledge=E2=80=99.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;In Sanskrit literature the term =E2=80=\r\n=98good people=E2=80=99 is used ironically to designate evil spirits, the a=\r\nsuras or rakshasas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;54 When a man scorched by the sun becomes cooled=\r\n by bathing in a mirage, or when one succeeds in cooking food on a painting=\r\n of a fire, then one may attain deliverance by theoretical knowledge.&lt;br&gt;\n\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;Thus, emphatically, the notion that theoretical knowledge is knowledge =\r\nis denounced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;55 Therefore, one who=\r\n talks advaita without actual experience of that truth is just the same as =\r\na dvaitin [a dualist]. Neither speech nor mind has any access to that supre=\r\nme state. He that abides in that state has no doctrine whatever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;Doctrines, more or less true, are of help to the aspirant. They do no=\r\nt survive in the state of deliverance (illumination). The sage does not =E2=\r\n=80=98know=E2=80=99 the Self, because he is the Self.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This equation =\r\nof him who has only theoretical knowledge with the dvaitin is justified as =\r\nfollows:&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;56 Those who think of themselves as advaitins say [from i=\r\nntellectual conviction alone] that the world is unreal, miserable and inert=\r\n [unconscious]. Others [professing dvaitins] say otherwise. But in the resu=\r\nlt all are alike.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;That is, all are in bondage and suffer the evils=\r\n of samsara. They all act as if the world were real.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;=\r\nfont-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.davidgodman.org/rtea=\r\nch/rpv_intro.shtml&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv=\r\n_intro.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:both;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;ma=\r\nrgin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:87%;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;=\r\nmargin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;--=\r\n &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82=C2=A0 =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B=C2=A0 =E0=B0=AD=\r\n=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B1=80=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF=C2=A0=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=C2=A0 =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd25cae91ccf7049ebb63f6--\r\n\n"}}
