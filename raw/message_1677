In history we see that every ancient culture had their own set of deit=\r\nies and rituals etc etc.\n\nIf deities are not universal and rather culture s=\r\npecific, are they a creation of the people? But if they are a creation of t=\r\nhe people, how do they have such universal abilities/powers and also their =\r\navatarts. We have in Sanatana Dharma many instances of amsa avatars of vari=\r\nous deities taking birth.\n\nWhat happens to the deities of a certain culture=\r\n, once the culture has died and there is no one to worship that deity? And =\r\nwhy did not the ancient deities of different cultures protect those culture=\r\ns from anihilation?\n\nAny thoughts on this would be interesting.\n\n-Regards\n =\r\nRajarshi\n\n\n\n\n"}}
