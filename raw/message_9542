( in tune if you feel like it)\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; With the recent Uttrakhand &quot;tragedy&quot;, a lot of questions by pseudo\n&gt; inte=\r\nllectuals everywhere were raised. Questions such as &quot; how could\n&gt; &#39;god&#39; kil=\r\nl so many devotees ? ; if god is there then how could this\n&gt; happen? Or is =\r\ngod really this cruel, or does god exist and blah blah.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; God and prosp=\r\nerity don&#39;t always end up in the same equation. Do they?\n&gt; \n&gt; First and for=\r\nemost is a need to understand what this whole suffering\n&gt; business is all a=\r\nbout and then dealing with it. When one is born here on\n&gt; this planet, ther=\r\ne is no &quot;suffering&quot;. As a child you don&#39;t know\n&gt; jack-shit or even care. If=\r\n your father passes away, lets say when you\n&gt; were 2, you would not sitting=\r\n in a corner wailing to the world &quot;My\n&gt; father, My Father, My father, god w=\r\nhy????&quot; ; like most adults would.\n&gt; Count the number of &quot;My&#39;s&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; If the=\r\n car is stolen, you are blissfully still sucking on your toy\n&gt; nipple just =\r\nlike you were sucking when your father passed away. You\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t go away =\r\nand shout your ass off in a police station &quot; My car, my\n&gt; car, my car, thos=\r\ne fucking thieves I&#39;ll kill them.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Count the my&#39;s again.\n&gt; \n&gt; In time =\r\n&quot;you&quot; grow up and start with all these &quot;my&#39;s&quot;.\n&gt; My house, my wife/husband,=\r\n my child, my money, my phone , my investment,\n&gt; my profit and more. Over a=\r\n period of time you got trained that this is\n&gt; you, this yours, that is the=\r\nirs, behave this way, talk this way, stand\n&gt; this way etc etc etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; The=\r\nn all this suffering crept in.\n&gt; \n&gt; For a human being, suffering comes in t=\r\nhe form of --\n&gt; \n&gt;      =95    Lack of financial resources to satiate desir=\r\nes and need.\n&gt;      =95    Loss of someone close/Death of a loved one\n&gt;    =\r\n  =95    Being cheated upon ; because you claimed someone as &quot;yours&quot;\n&gt; or p=\r\nerceived them to be &quot;yeh toh meri thi, yaa yeh toh mera tha&quot;\n&gt;      =95    =\r\nDreams and aspirations remaining unfulfilled.\n&gt;      =95    Lack of support=\r\n from fellow human beings.\n&gt;      =95    Partner looted you.\n&gt;      =95    =\r\nPhysical disability or some other constraint.\n&gt;      =95    and a few more =\r\nscenarios - but not much different from the\n&gt; above.\n&gt; \n&gt; True Suffering is=\r\n you being a turtle, and someone turned you on your\n&gt; back, and you are stu=\r\nck and want to just stand. It will take you 200\n&gt; years to before you die a=\r\nnd nobody will even stop once to turn you on\n&gt; your legs. Just kidding.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; On an average life expectancy scale, we only live for barely 60 to 70\n&gt; y=\r\nears, and in that short time frame ,there is so much &quot;suffering&quot;. It is\n&gt; s=\r\nuch a convoluted mess, and it is preposterous to say the least.\n&gt; \n&gt; Suffer=\r\ning is only limited to the surface personality or the body, and is\n&gt; largel=\r\ny based on perception. It usually stems from the basic belief of\n&gt; &quot;me,mine=\r\n and me again&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example- if lets say you lose your arm in an accid=\r\nent, you will\n&gt; still be alive and will be able to live your life barring a=\r\n little\n&gt; adjustment. Sure there will be something which you won&#39;t be able =\r\nto\n&gt; do,but then you are still alive. This suffering is only limited to the=\r\n\n&gt; body, because it was going to burn anyways , arm or not. True suffering\n=\r\n&gt; is when the actual you &quot;the being&quot; is tortured beyond the body post\n&gt; dea=\r\nth.\n&gt; \n&gt; We can&#39;t calculate about anyone&#39;s suffering without actually acces=\r\nsing\n&gt; the subtle body, wherein one actually has access to all the shit tha=\r\nt\n&gt; one has done in so many forms. In short, no debates, no arguments,\n&gt; as=\r\ntrologers(most), no nothing can answer the question &quot;why?&quot;, till you\n&gt; have=\r\n access to your own account of Karmas.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now the question is why isn&#39;t a=\r\nccess given? The law of karma is not a\n&gt; simple tit for tat &#39;karma is a bit=\r\nch&#39; theory in practice and if a\n&gt; &quot;being&quot; is not sufficiently detached from=\r\n the current personality, all\n&gt; hell can break loose because more and more =\r\nself identification with\n&gt; occur with previous karma&#39;s. To access that acco=\r\nunt, the level of\n&gt; detachment needed is akin to death in the current birth=\r\n. That only comes\n&gt; with a strenuous amount of penance and wish/will of god=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Suffering is limited to the surface personality which is false anywa=\r\nys,\n&gt; and all joy, happiness and sadness is related the personality. Thus\n&gt;=\r\n making that joy, happiness and sadness also false.\n&gt; \n&gt; Coming to the Uttr=\r\nakhand Tragedy, a lot of naysayers stated &quot;look what\n&gt; god has done, haha w=\r\ne told you there is no god, if god were there,\n&gt; couldn&#39;t he protect all hi=\r\ns devotees? Why all the suffering?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Death and god are two subjects tha=\r\nt are one and the same actually, but\n&gt; quite a lot of people want god, but =\r\ndon&#39;t wish to die. Sorry doesn&#39;t\n&gt; work like that.\n&gt; \n&gt; For the people on t=\r\nhe ground (referring to kedarnath), it was death of\n&gt; fellow human beings. =\r\nWe shouted, cursed and abused, because you god, you\n&gt; sitting up there, you=\r\n took everything from us, slam dunked an entire\n&gt; town, killed our fellow b=\r\neings. You killer! And that you killed those\n&gt; who came to worship you.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; A fundamentally flawed argument.\n&gt; \n&gt; The real situation is far different=\r\n from the one above, and cannot be\n&gt; described with the view point of the l=\r\nimited self personality. The\n&gt; debates are useless.\n&gt; \n&gt; God can always sho=\r\nw you that each and everyone of those beings is still\n&gt; alive, their person=\r\nalities are not, their bodies are not. But then\n&gt; he/she/it won&#39;t, we don&#39;t=\r\n deserve to see that.\n&gt; \n&gt; You won&#39;t buy this if you have lost a family mem=\r\nber in there. That is\n&gt; because &quot;you&quot; believe yourself to be &quot;you&quot;, and the=\r\n attachment to that\n&gt; specific personality, false anyways, is huge.\n&gt; \n&gt; On=\r\ne might argue that logic is difficult to accept and apply, nobody ever\n&gt; st=\r\nated that it was easy. And yes it is incredibly difficult, but\n&gt; everyone h=\r\nas to pay, and pay you must.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr Saturn is blamed in the most absurd ma=\r\nnner worldwide for all the\n&gt; mishaps that take place with people.\n&gt; Shani a=\r\nya , bhaago, Shani ki maa ki jai, mujhe chorr de please.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kyun?\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr=\r\n Saturn has only one duty, that is to take you back to the\n&gt; &quot;source&quot;,and f=\r\nor that wether  &quot;you&quot; have to go bankrupt, your valuables\n&gt; stolen, &quot;you&quot; b=\r\neing ridiculed humiliated, he doesn&#39;t; stop at nothing.\n&gt; For him &quot;you&quot; can=\r\n suffer for all you can, he at the end of the day is\n&gt; looking at the real =\r\nyou (only a small light CFL) will thank him.\n&gt; Everyone does.\n&gt; \n&gt; Basic po=\r\nint is trying to reach god, in the process you lose your current\n&gt; personal=\r\nity via suffering, and then only do you get to meet.\n&gt; \n&gt; For Eg - in the A=\r\nmarnath Yatra, do you take you car, your flat, your\n&gt; entire luggage, your =\r\nFD&#39;s , laptops and everything else up there? You\n&gt; leave it all behind.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Similarly, death of your personality is inevitable during this process,\n&gt;=\r\n and suffering is the only payment of your pending dues.\n&gt; \n&gt; Since we perc=\r\neive ourselves to be &quot;Mr X, Ms X&quot; and etc etc, we perceive\n&gt; ourselves to b=\r\ne suffering.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is only one way out , that is to go above and beyon=\r\nd this\n&gt; personality, and that is penance. Get Started today, who knows whe=\r\nn the\n&gt; reset button is hit and you are back again sucking the nipple and\n&gt;=\r\n restarting it all over again.\n&gt; \n&gt; Example---\n&gt; Lets say your name is  Mr =\r\nYakashmai tokoshomoto.\n&gt; Just kidding, lets say Mr Nexus.(it is an example)=\r\n\n&gt; You own 10 Crores, 2 flats, one car, small business, have a settled\n&gt; fa=\r\nmily, good looking man, chicks dig you, you have dealings abroad and\n&gt; are =\r\nblessed with prosperity.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     * One day, your 10 crores is taken awa=\r\ny by your partners in a fraud\n&gt; case, you aren&#39;t the culprit, but for the t=\r\nime being the court has\n&gt; seized assets.  ---- Suffering.\n&gt;     * Then you =\r\nget face paralysis, chicks don&#39;t dig you anymore, no easy\n&gt; sexus for mr ne=\r\nxus  ----- Suffering.\n&gt;     * One of your flats is taken over by land shark=\r\ns ---- Suffering.\n&gt;     * Your family distances itself from you ------ Suff=\r\nering.\n&gt;     * You run to astrologers and start flowing daal in rivers with=\r\nout\n&gt; believing in it ---- suffering.\n&gt;     * Your girlfriend is diagnosed =\r\nwith AIDS , woh toh mari, tumhaari\n&gt; sexus bhi gayi mr nexus.---- big suffe=\r\nring.\n&gt; \n&gt; (All of this happened over a period of 3 years, itni vaat ikathe=\r\n kum hi\n&gt; lagti hai)\n&gt; \n&gt; Then one day, you die, while the court case is ru=\r\nnning, while all\n&gt; disputes are unresolved, you go away. Your body is not c=\r\nremated for one\n&gt; day ,since it was evening when you left, and you know how=\r\n it is.\n&gt; \n&gt; You get to meet god, and god actually shows you that you only =\r\nbelieved\n&gt; yourself to be Mr Nexus, you actually aren&#39;t. Then a videotape w=\r\nas\n&gt; played. Showing you that you earlier incarnated as Jack (Nexus&#39;s\n&gt; mot=\r\nher&#39;s dog); Mr Champu (servant of your girlfriend&#39;s grandfather);\n&gt; various=\r\n chinese people, a seal in the antarctic, a cow , and 598765 more\n&gt; people.=\r\n Then you are showed , you cried then, you suffered then , just\n&gt; like you =\r\napparently suffered as Mr Nexus.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then you raised your eyebrow looked a=\r\nt god and all you could say was\n&gt; &quot;AAU&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; God only nodded in agreement.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; And then snap you were back, as Mr Nexus, but couldn&#39;t breathe. Naak\n&gt;=\r\n mein rui lagi hui thi naa. You got those out, threw away that white\n&gt; shee=\r\nt , got off the fatta, your family pissed their pants, and you\n&gt; declared y=\r\nour return.\n&gt; \n&gt; But then you remembered what you had seen. There was an et=\r\nernal calm\n&gt; about you, you fought the case without agitation, won back som=\r\ne money,\n&gt; but neither were you happy , nor depressed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some more losse=\r\ns happened, but you never got disturbed, and people\n&gt; started calling you a=\r\n monk, a mad man who is unconcerned , not motivated\n&gt; in life and yada and =\r\nyada. But you knew, that since you yourself (as mr\n&gt; nexus) are not true, a=\r\nnd are going to die, what is the use in going mad\n&gt; over things? Things tha=\r\nt are anyways going to go away soon. Things you\n&gt; only believe to be yours.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; That didn&#39;t you stopped earning, or sat idle, you worked, you worked\n=\r\n&gt; your ass off, but earned in detached manner, and whatever apparent\n&gt; suff=\r\nering you faced, you accepted it , and never went mad with it. And\n&gt; you wo=\r\nrshiped , as much as you could.\n&gt; \n&gt; Somebody asked you do you remain this =\r\nway, inspire of all the losses,\n&gt; and all you replied with was in the same =\r\ntone as this video, you\n&gt; actually sang this out.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://youtu.be/1jIx=\r\nFbRdFUs?t=3D38s\n&gt; \n&gt; Then one day you died. And were reborn later as Mr Gal=\r\naxy S4. LOL, just\n&gt; kidding.\n&gt; \n&gt; Funniest thing would be going to an astro=\r\nloger and her/him asking what\n&gt; happened ,and one responding with &quot;mere toh=\r\n law lag gaye=85..aau&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Seriously, suffering is solely perception. Hig=\r\nh level saints are almost\n&gt; always dead, surface level personalities are al=\r\nready long gone. And they\n&gt; go through the most amount of suffering (usuall=\r\ny). They have gone up\n&gt; like Mr Nexus,  and come back down as per god&#39;s wil=\r\nl. Some don&#39;t come\n&gt; back at all, that&#39;s god will too.\n&gt; \n&gt; God more often =\r\nthan not doesn&#39;t view us as solely us/humans. We might be\n&gt; cribbing about =\r\nthe suffering in Uttrakhand/our personal lives, but\n&gt; actually it doesn&#39;t m=\r\natter from his/her point of view. Because\n&gt; his/her/its POV is extremely di=\r\nfferent and our Percived POV is extremely\n&gt; different and limited. Thus, th=\r\ne debates and questions are never\n&gt; conclusive or answerable.\n&gt; \n&gt; Until we=\r\n can see, things from a broader perspective and not a limited\n&gt; viewpoint, =\r\nquestions and more questions will be there , which will have\n&gt; no answers, =\r\nbecause truth is essentially extremely different from what\n&gt; we can see, he=\r\nar or perceive it is.\n&gt; \n&gt; Time to retire now,\n&gt; time to sing to god, the l=\r\nyrics in the following one fit,\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D49Yo4=\r\n_9zNQ8\n&gt; &lt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D49Yo4_9zNQ8&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; And post the a=\r\nbove one, you can play this, if you wish to die laughing\n&gt; with devotion --=\r\n---\n&gt; http://youtu.be/DASfpntH0sI?t=3D5s &lt;http://youtu.be/DASfpntH0sI?t=3D5=\r\ns&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Jai Madame!\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
