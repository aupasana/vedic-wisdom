Where did he come from? According to Yoga Vasishtha, there are many Brahmas who come and go in the lifespan of one Vishnu and many Vishnus who come and go in the lifespan of one Shiva.\n \nAren&#39;t all these higher deities coming from (and going into) the Supreme Cosmic Being? Then, shouldn&#39;t he be called the father?\n \nSecondly, Brahma creates and causes various different kinds of self-awareness. Worship of Vishnu allows this self-awareness to pursue its various interests. Worship of Shiva allows it to undo itself and merge back with true Self. What will one gain from the worship of Brahma who creates variety and causes perception of variety? It is only meaningful to manage the existing variety, wade through it and overcome it.\n \n*        *        *\n \nOn worshipping Nirguna Parabrahma (Brahman):\n \nEach deity has dominion over a specific area in the field of duality. As we wade through the field of duality, we contemplate on those deities for mastery over (or benefits in) that area. But Nirguna Parabrahma (Brahman) has no specific gunas (he has all gunas and yet beyond their reach) and has no specific dominion (he thinks, desires, knows, perceives and acts though all beings of this universe, including various deities, demons, human beings and animals). Then, what do you worship Him for and how?\n \n*        *        *\n \nYoga Vaasishtham has a beautiful description of how to worship the Supreme Lord, who permeates the self of all beings in this universe. It says (a very brief summary), &quot;there is no point in offering flowers or lamp or incense etc to Supreme Lord. One worships the Surepeme Lord by engaging in actions non-volitionally, accepting what comes naturally, going with the flow with neither excitement nor worry, being neither attracted nor averse to anything, experiencing pleasure and pain, happiness and sadness with an equal vision. One worships the Supreme by offering all desires, thoughts and actions, including the ones sanctioned by scriptures as well as the ones forbidden by scriptures, to Supreme Lord with a calm and equanimous mind.&quot;\n \nBottomline: Correct worship of the Surepeme Lord can only be performed by a self-realized person. [Other people are also actually worshipping Supreme Lord through all their thoughts, desires, perception and actions, but they are not aware of it and hence the worship is incorrect.]\n \nBecause the bar is set so high for worshipping the Supreme Lord, we normally worship simpler deities with specific gunas, dominion, description etc. An unrealized mind can also relate to those deities and experience love and devotion for them. It is far more practical for many people than worshipping the Supreme Lord.\n \nIn fact, one can try to worship one deity (Krishna, Vishnu, Shiva, Durga, Lakshmi, Ganesha, Surya, Hanuman etc), get close to him and then worship the Supreme Lord though *that* deity. That is a far more practical way to reach the Supreme Lord for most people.\n \n*        *        *\n \nBy the way, Akshaya Triteeya is from 10:35 pm GMT on 2010 May 15 till 8:58 pm GMT on 2010 May 16. It is a very auspicious day for spiritual sadhana. It is the birthday of Ganga, who symbolizes purity. Though some jewllers are marketing in modern times as a good day to buy gold, Ganga does not represent gold but represents internal purity. It is a day that is conducive to bringing in internal purity. Spiritual sadhana done on that day is supposed to be 1000 times more effective than on a normal day.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- R D &lt;r_desai2002@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear Sir,\n&gt; \n&gt; All the great rishis and leaders of both Dwaita and Advaita are aware of the Vedas.  In the Vedas and Upanishads is written that God is one and that only vipras say there are many--why then do all the great realised ones and teachers ask us to pray to different Gods instead of the one Supreme Lord - Nirguna Brahman.  Saguna Brahman is represented by the Trinity = Brahma, Vishnu and Maheswara.  Lord Brahma is our creator- our father- all the Devas, manushyas and Rakshasas being derived from him yet we do not Worship our father.  Should not a son be closest to his father? \n&gt; \n&gt; Please clarify&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Yours truly,\n&gt; \n&gt; Rajendra\n\n\n"}}
