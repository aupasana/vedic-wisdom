Please point =\r\nout my mistakes I will make in this process.\n\nWe are trying to discuss thre=\r\ne points here\n\n1) Choosing a dietary habit\n2) Dependence of Human populatio=\r\nn on Non-veg sources of nutrition\n3) bioavailability or BV of Non veg vs Ve=\r\ng food.\n\nI commented on two points \n\n1) Choosing a dietary habit \n2) Depend=\r\nence of Human population on non veg sources of nutrition\n\n1) Choosing a Die=\r\ntary habit\n\nOne should choose his dietary habit based on his varna (aptitud=\r\ne and attitude) and goal in his life. He should not bother what the BV or o=\r\nther factor or research says. For an athlete, Eggs are important part of hi=\r\ns training. and for a person seeking spirituality one should stick to veget=\r\narian food unless he is able to rise above the difference in veg and nonveg=\r\n. I agree with Narasimha Ji about this point.\n\nIn some diseases Non veg sou=\r\nrces play an very important role (Although not a necessasity) like in Album=\r\nin deficiency two eggs per day can save a person from costly (3000Rs per In=\r\nj) Albumin Injections. In TB, Soup made of goat meat do wonders. Ayurveda a=\r\nlso recommend it strongly Charak Samhita) etc.\n\n2) Dependence of Human popu=\r\nlation on non veg sources of nutrition\n\nI agree with the link provided in t=\r\nhis discussions. Books and articles by Peta members are far more convincing=\r\n for switching to Veg sources. I can also provide tens of links and book re=\r\nference which oppose their view. Honestly, I do not believe each and every =\r\ninformation on net and not every book written about nutirtion, just like as=\r\ntrology. Let us leave this debate aside and look at other aspect of it.\n\nBy=\r\n &#39;Practically impossible&#39; I meant the cost factor and demand/supply factor.=\r\n In India (Leave other high Nonveg consuming countries alone) about 45% peo=\r\nple are Non vegetarian and about 40% demand of Proteins are supplied by Non=\r\n veg sources. Currently, Important veg sourcesof proteins are Legumes (incl=\r\nuding gram soyabean, pulses etc. Costs about Rs 80 -120 Rs per Kg), Nuts (i=\r\nnclude almonds cashew etc - Costs needn&#39;t mention), Dairy products (Milk be=\r\ning 30-40 Rs per Kg), Grains (cheapest sources but not a very complete sour=\r\nce), \n\nIn last two years, their demand rose by 15-20 % but their price rose=\r\n by 40-60%. even at current price, 60 % of population can not afford a comp=\r\nlete balanced diet as recommended by Experts which include 250 Ml of milk, =\r\n50-70 gms of legumes, 10 gms of vegetables, 150 gms of fruits per person, a=\r\nlong with grains and roughage etc (These are approx minimum quantities. Dif=\r\nferent sources may quote different quantities). There is average family siz=\r\ne of 5 and average family income is 200 Rs per day! And nutrition is not th=\r\ne only thing needed in our life!!! Lot of other expenditures are there\n\nEve=\r\nn at current prices, 60% population can not afford balanced diet. If additi=\r\nonal 40% is included in demand of veg sources, price may rise another 100% =\r\nand I need not to explain what will happen at that time.\n\nSir, I am not adv=\r\nocating Non-veg food here. I am also a strict vegetarian, even for milk I p=\r\nrefer a source where there is minimum cruelity (Yes you can not expect no c=\r\nruelity even for milk if you buy it from market and do not produce it yours=\r\nelf)\n\nAgain, I think and believe that practically it is impossible to shift=\r\n all the population to veg sources especially when the agriculture land is =\r\ndecreasing day by day because of many reasons)\n\n3) Bioavailability or BV of=\r\n different sources\n\nIt is always a questionable point. because again sectio=\r\nns supporting vegetarian diet will highlight the results which support veg =\r\nfood and vice versa. There are lot of halfbaked researches. but if we think=\r\n scientifically we will find that for different sources different sources a=\r\nre better. For example calcium animal sources are best (Including milk), fo=\r\nr albumin Egg is best, for Vit C veg sources are best, for proteins animal =\r\nsources are best (Ayurveda also support this) So I think we can not say tha=\r\nt only veg or non veg will suffice the diet. Obviously humans can not survi=\r\nve on Nonveg food alone. As far as BV is concerned I agree with the values =\r\ngiven by Rajarshi ji.\n\nYes, I agree Non veg food increases tamas in mind. B=\r\nut so does the deep fried vegetarian food, although less but in daily habit=\r\n it will not let you escape from Tamas. I agree with Narasimha Ji that if m=\r\nore energy is used in digesting food, less energy is available for brain. i=\r\nt is a scietific fact that after food, significant blood supply is directed=\r\n to intestines. How much Rajas Spicy food, tea, coffee, coke and Red bull i=\r\ns increasing in us? We are what we eat! This is true. So one should eat wha=\r\nt one want to become.\n\nBut still at last, I want to mention that I am not a=\r\ndvocating Non-veg food. I am just highlighting the facts. I am a strict veg=\r\netarian too. We should understand that we may be right but we should realis=\r\ne that it does not necessarily mean other person is not right.\n\nPlease poin=\r\nt out my mistakes I had made in this post. I agree that some values i menti=\r\noned here may not be exactly as quoted by sources. But they are approximate=\r\n and not too much off the line.\n\nKind Regards\nAtul\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yah=\r\noogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Narasimha,=\r\n\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; I disgree with two points you mentioned.

I am \n&gt; open to le=\r\narning and reviewing my position, provided there is genuine evidence.\n&gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Their theory was that digestion of meat takes up more energy.

In my other mail, I have \n&gt; qoted from a couple of research papers an=\r\nd books on clinical nutrition and \n&gt; dietetics, and if you ask, I can provi=\r\nde more; which may=C3=82=C2=A0take a few days since I \n&gt; have to get them f=\r\nrom people who deal with these topics professionally, but time \n&gt; is not a =\r\nproblem.=C3=82=C2=A0All the papers are=C3=82=C2=A0from the most accepted an=\r\nd reputed \n&gt; scientific=C3=82=C2=A0journals. There is no confusion. Which i=\r\ns why I said, it is myth \n&gt; that=C3=82=C2=A0vegeterian=C3=82=C2=A0foods are=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0easier to digest, if digestibility is the criteria. \n&gt; \n&gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Further, in my experience, I never found traditional vegeterian=\r\ns to be any more \n&gt; dull or smarter than traditional omnivores. \n&gt; \n&gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0\n&gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Animals have their own vaasanas=\r\n and their needs. \n&gt; If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Oth=\r\nerwise, feed the poor \n&gt; fellow whatever he/she needs.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; An =\r\nanimal has a specific physical=C3=82=C2=A0structure and needs to maintain t=\r\nhe same. But \n&gt; if trained they can &#39;adjust&#39; to any kind of meals. I have s=\r\neen people feeding \n&gt; vegeterian diets to dogs. Statistically speaking, an =\r\nanimal whose whole body \n&gt; structure is designed to be a carnivore, may adj=\r\nust to any food for the sake of \n&gt; survival, but will become internally wea=\r\nk and susceptable to disease and \n&gt; weaknesses. Who takes the karma for the=\r\n disease and weakness that may result \n&gt; from an unnatural diet to an anima=\r\nl? \n&gt; \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Not that all dogs who are feed a veg diet end up be=\r\ning diseased, but the chances \n&gt; increase a lot. It is like not all smokers=\r\n die of cancer, but smoking makes one \n&gt; susceptible to cancer. It increase=\r\ns the probability. Therefore my personal \n&gt; opinion is that an animal if ke=\r\npt at home, it should taken care of in the best \n&gt; way possible, providing =\r\nit with whatever maybe needed, including the right diet.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; _______________\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; A question f=\r\nor you.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Scientists studying evolution and human body struc=\r\ntures have concluded that meat \n&gt; eating along with cropping and fruits has=\r\n been prevelant since at least 4 \n&gt; million years. That, without a diet whi=\r\nch was omnivorous, the structure of the \n&gt; human stomach (lack of a develop=\r\ned=C3=82=C2=A0caecum),=C3=82=C2=A0and the threefold increase in=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\nbrain \n&gt; size (from archeological evidences)=C3=82=C2=A0could never have be=\r\nen what it is today. \n&gt; Which means, an omnivorous diet has been a=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0natural process, so ingrained that it \n&gt; has changed the very structure =\r\nof the human body. This cannot be done \n&gt; consciously, but only by the work=\r\n of natural forces.

Production of various che=\r\nmicals in our body and their \n&gt; interactions, are controlled by what we eat=\r\n. Thus, what we eat has a profound \n&gt; impact on us.\n&gt; \n&gt; (2) Much has been =\r\nwritten on the material benefits from vegetarianism. But that \n&gt; is not all=\r\n. There are spiritual and subtle reasons as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; Eating the flesh or =\r\nbody parts of an animal that strongly identifies with the \n&gt; physical body =\r\nentails a karma. Self-identification of plants with their physical \n&gt; body =\r\nis much subtler and the karma entailed in eating plant-based foods is much =\r\n\n&gt; smaller.\n&gt; \n&gt; Especially these days, very cruel methods are used for mea=\r\nt production by \n&gt; corporations and animals are treated very cruelly. Part =\r\nof the karma for their \n&gt; suffering goes to the ones benefiting from their =\r\nmeat.\n&gt; \n&gt; (3) I heard an interview with a scientist on NPR (National Publi=\r\nc Radio) several \n&gt; months back. They conducted an experiment on gorillas. =\r\nOne set of gorillas was \n&gt; fed with meat. The other set was fed with nuts, =\r\nfruits etc. After several \n&gt; months, researchers found a gap in the intelli=\r\ngence of the two sets. The ones \n&gt; fed with meat were duller.\n&gt; \n&gt; Their th=\r\neory was that digestion of meat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed with \n&gt; =\r\nnuts and fruits may have diverted more energy towards the development of br=\r\nain. \n&gt; Though they were not sure if the same thing applies to human beings=\r\n or not, a \n&gt; balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellect=\r\nual development.\n&gt; \n&gt; (4) After we eat a heavy meal, we may feel dull or sl=\r\neepy and cannot focus well \n&gt; on work that requires alertness and skill. Th=\r\nat is because the digestive process \n&gt; is using up a lot of energy (also kn=\r\nown as agni or fire) and there isn&#39;t much \n&gt; agni available for other activ=\r\nities such as digestion of intellectual ideas that \n&gt; happens in the mind. =\r\nSimilarly, digestion of spiritual ideas/experiences also \n&gt; requires agni a=\r\nnd that cannot happen well. That is why meditation or homam after \n&gt; a heav=\r\ny meal are fruitless and we are normally advised to do sadhana before \n&gt; ea=\r\nting.\n&gt; \n&gt; (5) If foods that light up a higher digestive agni (e.g. meats, =\r\ndeep fried food \n&gt; with more oil, spicy foods that stimulate digestive agni=\r\n etc) are consumed more \n&gt; frequently, agni is diverted towards digestion m=\r\nore often and there is less agni \n&gt; available for assimilaring intellectual=\r\n and spiritual ideas and experiences. If \n&gt; one eats saattwik food that is =\r\nvery easy to digest (simple grains, simple \n&gt; lentils and simple vegetables=\r\n, all softly cooked with mild spices, and fruits), \n&gt; less agni is diverted=\r\n towards digestion and more agni is available for \n&gt; assimilaring intellect=\r\nual and spiritual ideas and experiences.\n&gt; \n&gt; (6) Even a big fire cannot bu=\r\nrn wet grass well. But huge stacks of dry grass may \n&gt; be burnt by just one=\r\n spark! Similarly, little bit of internal fire may be enough \n&gt; to assimila=\r\nte spiritual ideas and experiences in a person with excellent \n&gt; vaasanas a=\r\nnd few obstructions (dry grass). A lot of internal fire may be needed \n&gt; in=\r\n a person with poor vaasanas and many obstructions (wet grass). Thus, it al=\r\nl \n&gt; depends on vaasanas and impurities in nadis and chakras.\n&gt; \n&gt; One pers=\r\non may eat meat and deep fried foods, spend a lot of agni on digesting \n&gt; t=\r\nhem and yet make excellent spiritual progress. Another person may eat saatt=\r\nwik \n&gt; food, maximize the agni available for spiritual transformation and y=\r\net struggle \n&gt; to progress spiritually. However, the best course of action =\r\nfor one is to ignore \n&gt; counter-examples and be a vegetarian. All other thi=\r\nngs being equal, that \n&gt; maximizes the agni available for spiritual progres=\r\ns.\n&gt; \n&gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Animals have their own vaasanas and=\r\n their needs. \n&gt; If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwi=\r\nse, feed the poor \n&gt; fellow whatever he/she needs.\n&gt; \n&gt; (8) One should eat =\r\nto live and not live to eat. A yogi should consume enough \n&gt; food to sustai=\r\nn oneself so that one can fulfil one&#39;s dharma in the material \n&gt; world usin=\r\ng physical body and make spiritual progress. Eating too much food is \n&gt; not=\r\n good for spiritual sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; Instead of overeating most of the time an=\r\nd fasting on specific days, it is \n&gt; better to eat limited amount always. R=\r\negular practices are more important for \n&gt; transformation and success, than=\r\n occasional practices.\n&gt; \n&gt; (9) By merely thinking that god is the doer of =\r\nall actions or considering food \n&gt; to be god&#39;s prasad, one cannot escape th=\r\ne karma involved. It depends on how \n&gt; deeply ingrained that thought is and=\r\n how deeply one feels so. If one internally \n&gt; feels 100% that god is actin=\r\ng through one and whatever one is doing (e.g. \n&gt; eating) is just god&#39;s pras=\r\nad to one, then one is free.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free=\r\n Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for s=\r\nhort Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Films that=\r\n make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt; Spirituality: http://group=\r\ns.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-1607522917-1291269310=:85782\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dear Members on this forum,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I want to understand what is veg food and non veg food=\r\n in real sense?

Please point=\r\n out my mistakes I will make in this process.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We are trying to discu=\r\nss three points here&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1) Choosing a dietary habit&lt;BR&gt;2) Dependence of=\r\n Human population on Non-veg sources of nutrition&lt;BR&gt;3) bioavailability or =\r\nBV of Non veg vs Veg food.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I commented on two points &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1) Choo=\r\nsing a dietary habit &lt;BR&gt;2) Dependence of Human population on non veg sourc=\r\nes of nutrition&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1) Choosing a Dietary habit&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One should choose=\r\n his dietary habit based on his varna (aptitude and attitude) and goal in h=\r\nis life. He should not bother what the BV or other factor or research says.=\r\n For an athlete, Eggs are important part of his training. and for a person =\r\nseeking spirituality one should stick to vegetarian food\n unless he is able=\r\n to rise above the difference in veg and nonveg. I agree with Narasimha Ji =\r\nabout this point.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In some diseases Non veg sources play an very impo=\r\nrtant role (Although not a necessasity) like in Albumin deficiency two eggs=\r\n per day can save a person from costly (3000Rs per Inj) Albumin Injections.=\r\n In TB, Soup made of goat meat do wonders. Ayurveda also recommend it stron=\r\ngly Charak Samhita) etc.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2) Dependence of Human population on non ve=\r\ng sources of nutrition&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I agree with the link provided in this discus=\r\nsions. Books and articles by Peta members are far more convincing for switc=\r\nhing to Veg sources. I can also provide tens of links and book reference wh=\r\nich oppose their view. Honestly, I do not believe each and every informatio=\r\nn on net and not every book written about nutirtion, just like astrology. L=\r\net us leave this debate aside and look at other aspect of it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;By &#39;Pr=\r\nactically impossible&#39; I meant the cost factor and\n demand/supply factor. In=\r\n India (Leave other high Nonveg consuming countries alone) about 45% people=\r\n are Non vegetarian and about 40% demand of Proteins are supplied by Non ve=\r\ng sources. Currently, Important veg sourcesof proteins are Legumes (includi=\r\nng gram soyabean, pulses etc. Costs about Rs 80 -120 Rs per Kg), Nuts (incl=\r\nude almonds cashew etc - Costs needn&#39;t mention), Dairy products (Milk being=\r\n 30-40 Rs per Kg), Grains (cheapest sources but not a very complete source)=\r\n, &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In last two years, their demand rose by 15-20 % but their price r=\r\nose by 40-60%. even at current price, 60 % of population can not afford a c=\r\nomplete balanced diet as recommended by Experts which include 250 Ml of mil=\r\nk, 50-70 gms of legumes, 10 gms of vegetables, 150 gms of fruits per person=\r\n, along with grains and roughage etc (These are approx minimum quantities. =\r\nDifferent sources may quote different quantities). There is average family =\r\nsize of 5 and average family income is 200\n Rs per day! And nutrition is no=\r\nt the only thing needed in our life!!! Lot of other expenditures are there&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Even at current prices, 60% population can not afford balanced diet.=\r\n If additional 40% is included in demand of veg sources, price may rise ano=\r\nther 100% and I need not to explain what will happen at that time.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;S=\r\nir, I am not advocating Non-veg food here. I am also a strict vegetarian, e=\r\nven for milk I prefer a source where there is minimum cruelity (Yes you can=\r\n not expect no cruelity even for milk if you buy it from market and do not =\r\nproduce it yourself)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Again, I think and believe that practically it =\r\nis impossible to shift all the population to veg sources especially when th=\r\ne agriculture land is decreasing day by day because of many reasons)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;3) Bioavailability or BV of different sources&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is always a questi=\r\nonable point. because again sections supporting vegetarian diet will highli=\r\nght the results which support veg\n food and vice versa. There are lot of ha=\r\nlfbaked researches. but if we think scientifically we will find that for di=\r\nfferent sources different sources are better. For example calcium animal so=\r\nurces are best (Including milk), for albumin Egg is best, for Vit C veg sou=\r\nrces are best, for proteins animal sources are best (Ayurveda also support =\r\nthis) So I think we can not say that only veg or non veg will suffice the d=\r\niet. Obviously humans can not survive on Nonveg food alone. As far as BV is=\r\n concerned I agree with the values given by Rajarshi ji.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yes, I agre=\r\ne Non veg food increases tamas in mind. But so does the deep fried vegetari=\r\nan food, although less but in daily habit it will not let you escape from T=\r\namas. I agree with Narasimha Ji that if more energy is used in digesting fo=\r\nod, less energy is available for brain. it is a scietific fact that after f=\r\nood, significant blood supply is directed to intestines. How much Rajas Spi=\r\ncy food, tea, coffee, coke\n and Red bull is increasing in us? We are what w=\r\ne eat! This is true. So one should eat what one want to become.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But =\r\nstill at last, I want to mention that I am not advocating Non-veg food. I a=\r\nm just highlighting the facts. I am a strict vegetarian too. We should unde=\r\nrstand that we may be right but we should realise that it does not necessar=\r\nily mean other person is not right.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Please point out my mistakes I h=\r\nad made in this post. I agree that some values i mentioned here may not be =\r\nexactly as quoted by sources. But they are approximate and not too much off=\r\n the line.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Kind Regards&lt;BR&gt;Atul&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.m=\r\nc946.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;=\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste Narasimha,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I disgr=\r\nee with two points you mentioned.\n Let me clarify. (I am only dealing with =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the science part of these discussions, as I had already maintained=\r\n right at the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; beginning).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (3) I heard=\r\n an interview with a scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) several &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; months back. They conducted an experiment on gorillas. One set of goril=\r\nlas was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; fed with meat. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc=\r\n. After several &lt;BR&gt;&gt; months, researchers found a gap in the intelligenc=\r\ne of the two sets. The ones &lt;BR&gt;&gt; fed with meat were duller.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; If=C3=82&nbsp;you have any references for this, in terms of whether t=\r\nhey published any &lt;BR&gt;&gt; paper on the same, I am interested to know and a=\r\nnalyse that in details. I am &lt;BR&gt;&gt; open to learning and reviewing my pos=\r\nition, provided there is genuine evidence.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The=\r\nir theory was that digestion of meat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed wit=\r\nh &lt;BR&gt;&gt; nuts and fruits may have\n diverted more energy towards the devel=\r\nopment of brain. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Though they were not sure if the same thing appli=\r\nes to human beings or not,=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; balanced veget=\r\narian diet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellectual development.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; This is a wrong theory as far as human nutrition=C3=82&nb=\r\nsp;is concerned, because human &lt;BR&gt;&gt; stomach structure (gut morphology) =\r\nis such that it finds certain animal products &lt;BR&gt;&gt; far easier to digest=\r\n than most planet based products. In my other mail, I have &lt;BR&gt;&gt; qoted f=\r\nrom a couple of research papers and books on clinical nutrition and &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; dietetics, and if you ask, I can provide more; which may=C3=82&nbsp;take =\r\na few days since I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; have to get them from people who deal with thes=\r\ne topics professionally, but time &lt;BR&gt;&gt; is not a problem.=C3=82&nbsp;All=\r\n the papers are=C3=82&nbsp;from the most accepted and reputed &lt;BR&gt;&gt; scie=\r\nntific=C3=82&nbsp;journals. There is no confusion. Which is\n why I said, it=\r\n is myth &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that=C3=82&nbsp;vegeterian=C3=82&nbsp;foods are=C3=82&nbs=\r\np;easier to digest, if digestibility is the criteria. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Further, in my experience, I never found traditional vege=\r\nterians to be any more &lt;BR&gt;&gt; dull or smarter than traditional omnivores.=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Ani=\r\nmals have their own vaasanas and their needs. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If an animal can sur=\r\nvive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor &lt;BR&gt;&gt; fellow wha=\r\ntever he/she needs.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; An animal has a specific p=\r\nhysical=C3=82&nbsp;structure and needs to maintain the same. But &lt;BR&gt;&gt; i=\r\nf trained they can &#39;adjust&#39; to any kind of meals. I have seen people feedin=\r\ng &lt;BR&gt;&gt; vegeterian diets to dogs. Statistically speaking, an animal whos=\r\ne whole body &lt;BR&gt;&gt; structure is designed to be a carnivore, may adjust t=\r\no any food for the sake of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; survival, but will become internally we=\r\nak and\n susceptable to disease and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; weaknesses. Who takes the karma=\r\n for the disease and weakness that may result &lt;BR&gt;&gt; from an unnatural di=\r\net to an animal? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Not that all dogs w=\r\nho are feed a veg diet end up being diseased, but the chances &lt;BR&gt;&gt; incr=\r\nease a lot. It is like not all smokers die of cancer, but smoking makes one=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; susceptible to cancer. It increases the probability. Therefore my=\r\n personal &lt;BR&gt;&gt; opinion is that an animal if kept at home, it should tak=\r\nen care of in the best &lt;BR&gt;&gt; way possible, providing it with whatever ma=\r\nybe needed, including the right diet.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; _______________&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; A question for you.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Scientists studying ev=\r\nolution and human body structures have concluded that meat &lt;BR&gt;&gt; eating =\r\nalong with cropping and fruits has been prevelant since at least 4 &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n million years. That,\n without a diet which was omnivorous, the structure o=\r\nf the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; human stomach (lack of a developed=C3=82&nbsp;caecum),=C3=82=\r\n&nbsp;and the threefold increase in=C3=82&nbsp;brain &lt;BR&gt;&gt; size (from ar=\r\ncheological evidences)=C3=82&nbsp;could never have been what it is today. &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; Which means, an omnivorous diet has been a=C3=82&nbsp;natural proce=\r\nss, so ingrained that it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; has changed the very structure of the hum=\r\nan body. This cannot be done &lt;BR&gt;&gt; consciously, but only by the work of =\r\nnatural forces. (Again, if you want, I will &lt;BR&gt;&gt; provide relevent resea=\r\nrch=C3=82&nbsp;papers to prove my claim).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; What=\r\n is your take on this? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Between me and You, there i=\r\ns only me. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Take away the me, so only You remain&quot; - Hallaj&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ________________________________&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: &lt;A\n href=3D&quot;http://in=\r\n.mc946.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; targe=\r\nt=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;=\r\n&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sent: Thu, 2 December, 2010 12:48=\r\n:03 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Food we eat&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&=\r\nnbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste friends,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; There has been a lot of di=\r\nscussion on food. A few quick comments.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (1) We are we we e=\r\nat. Production of various chemicals in our body and their &lt;BR&gt;&gt; interact=\r\nions, are controlled by what we eat. Thus, what we eat has a profound &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; impact on us.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (2) Much has been written on the materia=\r\nl benefits from vegetarianism. But that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; is not all. There are spir=\r\nitual and subtle reasons as well.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Eating the flesh or body=\r\n parts of an animal that strongly identifies with the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; physical bod=\r\ny entails a karma. Self-identification of plants with their\n physical &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; body is much subtler and the karma entailed in eating plant-based foods=\r\n is much &lt;BR&gt;&gt; smaller.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Especially these days, very cru=\r\nel methods are used for meat production by &lt;BR&gt;&gt; corporations and animal=\r\ns are treated very cruelly. Part of the karma for their &lt;BR&gt;&gt; suffering =\r\ngoes to the ones benefiting from their meat.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (3) I heard a=\r\nn interview with a scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) several &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; months back. They conducted an experiment on gorillas. One set of gorilla=\r\ns was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; fed with meat. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. =\r\nAfter several &lt;BR&gt;&gt; months, researchers found a gap in the intelligence =\r\nof the two sets. The ones &lt;BR&gt;&gt; fed with meat were duller.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; Their theory was that digestion of meat takes up more energy. Gorillas =\r\nfed with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; nuts and fruits may have diverted more energy towards the=\r\n development of brain. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Though they were not\n sure if the same thin=\r\ng applies to human beings or not, a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; balanced vegetarian diet perha=\r\nps can maximize one&#39;s intellectual development.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (4) After =\r\nwe eat a heavy meal, we may feel dull or sleepy and cannot focus well &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; on work that requires alertness and skill. That is because the digestiv=\r\ne process &lt;BR&gt;&gt; is using up a lot of energy (also known as agni or fire)=\r\n and there isn&#39;t much &lt;BR&gt;&gt; agni available for other activities such as =\r\ndigestion of intellectual ideas that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; happens in the mind. Similarl=\r\ny, digestion of spiritual ideas/experiences also &lt;BR&gt;&gt; requires agni and=\r\n that cannot happen well. That is why meditation or homam after &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a =\r\nheavy meal are fruitless and we are normally advised to do sadhana before &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; eating.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (5) If foods that light up a higher digest=\r\nive agni (e.g. meats, deep fried food &lt;BR&gt;&gt; with more oil, spicy foods t=\r\nhat stimulate digestive agni etc) are consumed\n more &lt;BR&gt;&gt; frequently, a=\r\ngni is diverted towards digestion more often and there is less agni &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; available for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and experienc=\r\nes. If &lt;BR&gt;&gt; one eats saattwik food that is very easy to digest (simple =\r\ngrains, simple &lt;BR&gt;&gt; lentils and simple vegetables, all softly cooked wi=\r\nth mild spices, and fruits), &lt;BR&gt;&gt; less agni is diverted towards digesti=\r\non and more agni is available for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; assimilaring intellectual and sp=\r\niritual ideas and experiences.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (6) Even a big fire cannot =\r\nburn wet grass well. But huge stacks of dry grass may &lt;BR&gt;&gt; be burnt by =\r\njust one spark! Similarly, little bit of internal fire may be enough &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; to assimilate spiritual ideas and experiences in a person with excellent=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; vaasanas and few obstructions (dry grass). A lot of internal fire=\r\n may be needed &lt;BR&gt;&gt; in a person with poor vaasanas and many obstruction=\r\ns (wet grass). Thus, it all &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n depends on vaasanas and impurities in=\r\n nadis and chakras.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; One person may eat meat and deep fried=\r\n foods, spend a lot of agni on digesting &lt;BR&gt;&gt; them and yet make excelle=\r\nnt spiritual progress. Another person may eat saattwik &lt;BR&gt;&gt; food, maxim=\r\nize the agni available for spiritual transformation and yet struggle &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; to progress spiritually. However, the best course of action for one is t=\r\no ignore &lt;BR&gt;&gt; counter-examples and be a vegetarian. All other things be=\r\ning equal, that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; maximizes the agni available for spiritual progres=\r\ns.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Animals have their own =\r\nvaasanas and their needs. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If an animal can survive on vegetarian f=\r\nood, good. Otherwise, feed the poor &lt;BR&gt;&gt; fellow whatever he/she needs.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (8) One should eat to live and not live to eat. A yogi sho=\r\nuld consume enough &lt;BR&gt;&gt; food to sustain oneself so that one can fulfil =\r\none&#39;s dharma in the material\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; world using physical body and make s=\r\npiritual progress. Eating too much food is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; not good for spiritual =\r\nsadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Instead of overeating most of the time and fastin=\r\ng on specific days, it is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; better to eat limited amount always. Reg=\r\nular practices are more important for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; transformation and success, =\r\nthan occasional practices.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (9) By merely thinking that god=\r\n is the doer of all actions or considering food &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to be god&#39;s prasad=\r\n, one cannot escape the karma involved. It depends on how &lt;BR&gt;&gt; deeply i=\r\nngrained that thought is and how deeply one feels so. If one internally &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; feels 100% that god is acting through one and whatever one is doing (=\r\ne.g. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; eating) is just god&#39;s prasad to one, then one is free.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyot=\r\nish Lessons, Jyotish\n Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for=\r\n short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrolog=\r\ner.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; Films that make a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/=\r\n&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spi=\r\nrituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D=\r\n_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; Jyotish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWriting=\r\ns&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWrit=\r\nings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n--0-1607522917-1291269310=:85782--\r\n\n"}}
