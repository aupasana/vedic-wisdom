Cleanse, cleanse - by uttering God&#39;s Name,=\r\n by thinking of God. The Name of God is verily God Himself. Supreme Divinit=\r\ny is present here. Name and God are not two. They are one and the same. Nam=\r\ne is God!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Anandamayi Ma\n&gt; &quot;Listen! Do not let your time pass idly. Ei=\r\nther keep a rosary with you and do japa; or if this does not suit you, at l=\r\neast go on repeating the Name of the Lord regularly and without interruptio=\r\nn like the ticking of a clock. There are no rules or restrictions in this. =\r\nInvoke Him by the Name that appeals to you most, for as much time as you ca=\r\nn--the longer the better. Even if you get tired or lose interest, administe=\r\nr the Name to yourself like a medicine that has to be taken. In this way yo=\r\nu will at some auspicious moment discover the rosary of the mind, and then =\r\nyou will continually hear within yourself the praises of the great Master, =\r\nthe Lord of Creation, like the never ceasing music of the boundless ocean; =\r\nYou will hear the land and the sea, the air and the heavens reverberate wit=\r\nh the song of His glory.

I will try and do homam more often- I really enjoy it. Will schedule one =\r\nfor tomorrow evening after work if possible. Good start to the Navaratri (h=\r\nad never heard about this Navaratri before). \n&gt; \n&gt; Rakesh ji, thanks for th=\r\ne message. You are quite right. Even breathing for God...that would be a gr=\r\neat state to be in...no idea when I&#39;m going to get there. Anyway peserveren=\r\nce is key. \n&gt; \n&gt; I think that nobody but God can get us to do Sadhana. I be=\r\nlieve that God walked every step of the way on the path for the saints... n=\r\nay, actually DID the sadhana for them ultimately. I know we have to &quot;make a=\r\nn effort&quot; and meet God halfway, but ultimately it is She and He who get us =\r\nto make the effort. That&#39;s why I said &quot;Damn you Durga&quot;....because You made =\r\nsome people make that supreme effort....You alone were their Sadhana Shakti=\r\n....and what about the rest of Your wretched children? What sort of partial=\r\n mother are you hmm? You did it for Mira, Rabia, Papa Ramdas, but what abou=\r\nt all of us eh? What sort of game is this? Anyway, it&#39;s Her game, that&#39;s th=\r\ne bottom line... what can we do except play along (we have to believe it&#39;s =\r\nultimately for our own good).\n&gt; \n&gt; Ok chaps, going to do some japa now.

Just develop a intense =\r\nlonging love for one form and feel the pangs of longing, develop the intens=\r\nity so that the longing consume you.  the name will repeat itself easily u =\r\nwont have to worry. Forget the counts god can count. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Do a homam, =\r\n15 min a day, that a open heart surgery. the panchopachr puja of offering 5=\r\n elements (isnt that tantra) is as powerful as biggest tantra sadhana if do=\r\nne with full love/surrender.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Your link of ramkrishan about surrend=\r\nering all emotions was bang on target. not because it was a great article i=\r\nn itself but because you are doing it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Intellectualize becomes a h=\r\nurdle which heart is not able to cross. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You said you got diksha f=\r\nor a mantra from a monk in shivananda tradition. do you know what that mean=\r\ns - Thats like warren buffet giving you an addon debit card to his bank bal=\r\nance.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; and as for puruscharan/count and activating a mantra many pe=\r\nople are able to activate at 1/10 counts, many not able to at even 10x coun=\r\nts, and many are able to activate seemingly wrong words &quot;hat para (get lost=\r\n)&quot; as their mantra.  ????\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; thanks for letting me answer &quot;myself&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bhairavi, &quot;Whoever does sadhana with whatever intention, they w=\r\nill achieve that.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, &quot;sunrise_1080&quot; &lt;sunrise_1080@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This bu=\r\nsiness of repeating God Name, that Nobody ji mentioned...it ain&#39;t no joke .=\r\n..doing it I mean! I tried today, and boy, it was hard...failed mostly, to =\r\nbe honest.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But every sage Ramakrishna, Anandamayi Ma, Ammachi,=\r\n Sivananda, Chaitanya, Mira, Rabia, Papa Ramdas, every one of them was obse=\r\nssed with this Name business. That means, there must be something to it.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I really want to take up Nobody ji&#39;s suggestion and get obsessed w=\r\nith the Name. I firmly believe in it. I got sick (real sick) a few times, a=\r\nnd the Name helped me (have had 2-3 black outs when I was unwell, long stor=\r\ny, but basically, I was conscious during these black outs, and it felt like=\r\n I was dying...and it sounds odd, but there were no thoughts except the Nam=\r\ne &quot;Keshava please help me&quot; or &quot;Narayana&quot;). These episodes scared the bejesu=\r\ns out of me, and each time I came out of them, I felt &quot;I MUST DO MORE JAPA&quot;=\r\n it&#39;s the only thing that&#39;ll save me. All else is of no use when I&#39;m in dee=\r\np sh*t (pardon my language), the Name alone is reliable.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; What =\r\nI&#39;m trying to say, is I want to devise some practical ways to get serious a=\r\nbout this sadhana. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sivananda Saraswati (Rishikesh) was a=\r\n big fan of japa, and especially of Purascharana (repeating mantra as many =\r\nlakhs as there are syllables in the mantra. Eg Gayatri has 24 syllables, so=\r\n one Purascharana is 24 lakh repetitions). He went on to say that 14 crore =\r\nof japa with feeling would result in Darshan of God in physical form, face =\r\nto face. That would be great! Really wanted to do it...but when I did the m=\r\naths, I worked out that, at the rate of 12 hours japa a day, every single d=\r\nay from now on, it would take me till age 83 to finish this. :( \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; But hey, I decided to make a start anyway, and began my my first Purasch=\r\narana of the Om Namo Narayanaya mantra, in January this year, I am doing a =\r\nmeasley 11 rounds a day, with my mind wandering most of the time (hard core=\r\n people do hundreds of rounds with proper concentration daily). I&#39;m a slow =\r\nchanter, and need to say the mantra loudly or in a barely audible whisper. =\r\nMy mental chanting is gradually improving but very difficult to do for more=\r\n than 1-2 minutes. It&#39;s gonna take me till October 2013 to finish the 8 lak=\r\nhs. Then my plan is to take a 3 month break (and do 7 rounds a day), and th=\r\nen start another Purascharana. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, two things help me get=\r\n my 11 rounds of japa done every day when I&#39;m at work/outdoors. Thought I&#39;d=\r\n mention it, if anybody&#39;s interested, just in case it&#39;s helpful. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; One is Telephone Japa. I hold my mobile to my ear, and pretend I&#39;m on t=\r\nhe phone. While doing this, I stick my hand in my pocket and count the japa=\r\n on my fingers. I get a couple of rounds done during my working day this wa=\r\ny (I check carefully to make sure nobody&#39;s listening). Also while stuck in =\r\ntraffic (while the car is NOT moving), I put my hands-free ear pieces on, a=\r\nnd pretend I&#39;m chatting to a friend on the phone and do a couple of rounds.=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The other thing that I find useful (now please excuse the ph=\r\nrase), is &quot;Toilet japa&quot;. When I need to escape to do a round or two of japa=\r\n at work, I excuse myself for a few minutes and lock myself up in a toilet =\r\ncubicle. I then very very quietly mutter the mantra to myself for 5-10 minu=\r\ntes (lips moving, no sound audible, in case anybody hears). I do about 2 se=\r\nssions of this a day. This allows me to complete my 11 rounds a day, on day=\r\ns when my working hours are long. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I know this sounds bonkers,=\r\n but I thought I&#39;d mention this for anyone else whose work life interferes =\r\nwith their japa. At least, it provides a solution to doing a bit of japa at=\r\n work.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If anybody else has any thoughts/suggestions, on how to=\r\n repeat God&#39; Name constantly, kindly share. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best wishes, and =\r\nOm Namo Narayanaya, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Aparna\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
