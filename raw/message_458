Similarly, all =\r\n\nthe &gt; &gt; &gt; Vedas and Puranas have fixed certain days for rituals! E.g., \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Nirjala Ekadashi is a sort of Tapasya only if we observe it in &gt; \n&gt; &gt; S=\r\nummer, when we feel most thirsty, whereas in Winter, it is &gt; \nhardly &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nworthwhile! And that is what we will be doing after a few \n&gt; centuries-&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; -celebrating that day in Winter--thanks to &quot;Vedic \nastrologers&quot; &gt; and &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; their &quot;Vedic astrology&quot;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;--- End \nforwarded message --- \n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMovies=\r\n, sports & news!
