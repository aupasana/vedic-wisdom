On the other side the Vegetarians=\r\n can get that from \nYoghurt, Cheese and such foods. And such many points ca=\r\nn be discussed from both \nthe sides.\n\n2) Few of the Arguments of Vegetarian=\r\ns and vegans is that of &quot;Formation of \nTeeth&quot;, &quot;Formation of Intestines&quot; et=\r\nc=E2=80=A6 They say that Human teeth formation and \ndigestive systems are n=\r\not suitable for diet from the source of Animals. They \nsite the examples of=\r\n a Hoarse, cow, Elephant, Goat, buffalo and compare that \nwith Humans. Whic=\r\nh I found not proved when I see people around me. Majority of \nthe populati=\r\non today and earlier are meat eaters and there does not seem any \nnoticeabl=\r\ne physical difference which suggest any difficulties for them. It is \nalso =\r\nnoticed that because of High protein contents, they are well built. Same \nw=\r\nay Physical strength, stamina, recovery from Illness and such were never is=\r\nsues \nwith generations of people in India and else where who never used mea=\r\nt and sea \nfood in their diet.\n\nSo science will not be able to give definit=\r\nive answer for some one to decide \nbetween 2 strict options, unless science=\r\n proves without a doubt, that a certain \ndisease or a Physical ailment or a=\r\n mental abnormality is only because of *eating \nmeat* or *NOT eating meat* =\r\nand that should also clearly visible in practical \ncases which affect large=\r\n section of masses. Till that time, so called science, \nwill mainly be used=\r\n as a tool to debate on this issue of vegetarianism and \nNon-vegetarianism =\r\nbecause we do see that Diabetic ailment, Cardiac patients, \nBlood pressure =\r\nproblems and such many commonly seen diseases are found in all \nsections of=\r\n society irrespective of meat eaters or vegetarians. Both sections \nare liv=\r\ning their lives for Generations and generations.\n\nRegarding Holistic approa=\r\nch, ethics, Low of Karma etc=E2=80=A6\n\n1) One of My very close doctor frien=\r\nd who is a pediatric surgeon (M.Ch. in \nPediatrics) and a strict vegetarian=\r\n who also obviously contains a vast knowledge \nof medical science gave me a=\r\n certain interesting fact. During his studies, their \nbatch was once taken =\r\nto a place called Deonar in Mumbai, (where there is one of \nthe biggest Sla=\r\nughter houses of India. Daily around 4000 various animals are \nslaughtered =\r\nto meet the need of Maharashtra and to some extent India and 60% is \nexport=\r\ned mainly to Arab countries). 4 or 5 females from their batch could not \nst=\r\nand the process of slaughtering and they fell unconscious. Almost everybody=\r\n \nincluding himself was shocked and disgusted to see the slaughterhouse and=\r\n left \nthe place with heavy hearts.\n\n2) There are meat eaters who are well =\r\nadvanced in spiritual path and there are \nvegetarians who are utterly selfi=\r\nsh and deep down in materialism hence I refrain \nto talk on that line. Only=\r\n I wish to say one thing that ethics, spirituality and \nsuch terms should n=\r\not be used selectively as per our own conveniences. Something \nwhich is une=\r\nthical will remain unethical. To me, Killing animals, while better \nalterna=\r\nte sources are available, to satiate hunger and far worst, to tickle the \np=\r\nalate, is Unethical and simply unethical, be it or Earth or on Mars, be it =\r\n\nKaliyuga or Satyuga.\n\n3) Solution is not to look if a Famous Saint or Phil=\r\nosopher or any body, famous \nor otherwise, approves meat eating or disprove=\r\ns it or suggests middle approach, \nit does not make any difference. If Vima=\r\nlananda emphatically suggest not to eat \nmeat or otherwise (Vimalananda was=\r\n very clear for meat eating though), does not \nmake any difference. Law of =\r\nKarma might be infinitely complex and might need \ndeepest of understanding =\r\nbut that does not suggest any thing. Who knows if next \nbirth is there or n=\r\not? However what really suggestive and decisively suggestive \nshould be our=\r\n own Instincts, our own thinking, our own rationale, our own heart. \nWhy de=\r\npend upon any body coming and telling us about if we should eat meat or \nsh=\r\nould not. Why not follow our own conscious and rationale. I do not know if =\r\nI \nkill a Goat and eat meat of the same, in the next life or lives, I will =\r\nbe \nkilled by the same Goat and I have to go through the same pain. Hardly =\r\nanybody \nknows that but when it comes to the present, I know for sure that =\r\nthe meat I am \neating has been of an animal that has been butchered mercile=\r\nssly. That much is \nknown without a doubt and that should make me think. If=\r\n *avoidable*, I must not \neat that. It is that simple. Do not need further =\r\napproval of anybody and no \namount of arguments from Science or culture or =\r\nreligions or whatever should \nstand for me. Do I need to even look at those=\r\n? NO.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pa=\r\nthak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Atul Ji and List members,\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;I am not advocating Non-veg food. I am\n&gt; &gt;just highlighting the facts. I a=\r\nm a strict vegetarian too. We &gt;should \n&gt;understand that we may be right but=\r\n we should realize that &gt;it does not \n&gt;&gt;necessarily mean other person is no=\r\nt right.\n&gt; \n&gt; My views are there on this subject in archives. I wanted to s=\r\ntay away but still \n&gt;inspired to write at least one message on the same.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; 1) Using Arguments based on science, BV, so many of researches and plent=\r\ny of \n&gt;informations available on the Internet, One will never be able to co=\r\nme to a \n&gt;definitive conclusions.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) I never argue with people (even w=\r\nhen I was aggressive and passionate about \n&gt;the Idea of vegetarian food) wi=\r\nth the above basis.\n&gt; Whatever said and done, people will continue eating m=\r\neat, eggs, Fish, Other \n&gt;seafood and probably Human flash as well. I have, =\r\nwith experience, understood \n&gt;that there is no point in arguing with people=\r\n giving various Data. Each side \n&gt;will have their own arguments, own sets o=\r\nf Data and own Counter Ideas to prove \n&gt;their point.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) Instead I appe=\r\nal their conscious! I tell people around me, whenever the \n&gt;Topic comes up,=\r\n only one simple thing - &quot;I dont want to kill for filling up my \n&gt;Stomach&quot; =\r\nand I say it from my heart. I tell people that Put a knife edge on your \n&gt;o=\r\nwn Throat or Cut a finger only a little, feel the pain and now realize the =\r\n\n&gt;Plight of a butchered Chicken or a Goat or a cow or a buffalo or a...., \n=\r\n&gt;Suffocate yourself by closing Nose & Mouth and see after only a few second=\r\ns, how \n&gt;you pent for the Air and Now realize the &quot;Chhatpataahat&quot; of a fish=\r\n forced out of \n&gt;water.\n&gt; \n&gt; And all these, because one wish to fill the st=\r\nomach or satisfy cravings of a \n&gt;habitual palate or both. Even vegetarians =\r\nhave their cravings of spice and other \n&gt;food stuff but the very vital diff=\r\nerence is that such craving does not need \n&gt;killing!\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) Just to give a=\r\n result, One of colleagues, who is a Srilankan, has left \n&gt;eating meat sinc=\r\ne 6 Months now and surely, one of the reasons for his leaving \n&gt;meat is bec=\r\nause I told my views him a few times when such discussions came up \n&gt;and I =\r\neven told him that you are a Buddhist, the religion of Non-Injury and see \n=\r\n&gt;what has happened to that very Idea. Hats-off to him for he really seems t=\r\no have \n&gt;thought about it and dared to change his swabhava which is so very=\r\n difficult.\n&gt; Just to clarify, I do not hesitate to express my views even t=\r\no Muslims and \n&gt;others and at least, this idea is appreciated by them even =\r\nif grudgingly. The \n&gt;Hard core meat eaters are also taken a back with this =\r\nidea. All though they know \n&gt;from their hearts of hearts, it comes as a sho=\r\nck even to them when somebody \n&gt;boldly brings that up. Most of us are like =\r\na cat that drinks the milk with \n&gt;closed eyes. The Idea would have gone in =\r\ntheir mind and that is enough. One day \n&gt;probably it will germinate.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5=\r\n) Finally, The point is not to say that this side is good and that side is =\r\n\n&gt;bad. It&#39;ll be a foolish and unpalatable conclusion. It is to just appeal =\r\nthe \n&gt;inside human of each individual, It is to appeal the rational Intelli=\r\ngence of an \n&gt;Individual, It is to appeal the heart of a person and if that=\r\n is not suffice to \n&gt;our ultra-hardened heart then a final reminder of &quot;Law=\r\n of Cause and effect -The \n&gt;Law of Karma&quot; at least to those of us who belie=\r\nve in Natures unfailing \n&gt;governance.

Please point out my mistakes I =\r\nwill make in this \n&gt;process.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We are trying to discuss three points=\r\n here\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) Choosing a dietary habit\n&gt; &gt; 2) Dependence of Human popul=\r\nation on Non-veg sources of nutrition\n&gt; &gt; 3) bioavailability or BV of Non v=\r\neg vs Veg food.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I commented on two points \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) Choosing a =\r\ndietary habit \n&gt; &gt; 2) Dependence of Human population on non veg sources of =\r\nnutrition\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) Choosing a Dietary habit\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One should choose h=\r\nis dietary habit based on his varna (aptitude and \n&gt;attitude) and goal in h=\r\nis life. He should not bother what the BV or other factor \n&gt;or research say=\r\ns. For an athlete, Eggs are important part of his training. and \n&gt;for a per=\r\nson seeking spirituality one should stick to vegetarian food unless he \n&gt;is=\r\n able to rise above the difference in veg and nonveg. I agree with Narasimh=\r\na \n&gt;Ji about this point.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In some diseases Non veg sources play an =\r\nvery important role (Although not a \n&gt;necessasity) like in Albumin deficien=\r\ncy two eggs per day can save a person from \n&gt;costly (3000Rs per Inj) Albumi=\r\nn Injections. In TB, Soup made of goat meat do \n&gt;wonders. Ayurveda also rec=\r\nommend it strongly Charak Samhita) etc.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) Dependence of Human pop=\r\nulation on non veg sources of nutrition\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I agree with the link prov=\r\nided in this discussions. Books and articles by \n&gt;Peta members are far more=\r\n convincing for switching to Veg sources. I can also \n&gt;provide tens of link=\r\ns and book reference which oppose their view. Honestly, I do \n&gt;not believe =\r\neach and every information on net and not every book written about \n&gt;nutirt=\r\nion, just like astrology. Let us leave this debate aside and look at other =\r\n\n&gt;aspect of it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; By &#39;Practically impossible&#39; I meant the cost facto=\r\nr and demand/supply factor. \n&gt;In India (Leave other high Nonveg consuming c=\r\nountries alone) about 45% people \n&gt;are Non vegetarian and about 40% demand =\r\nof Proteins are supplied by Non veg \n&gt;sources. Currently, Important veg sou=\r\nrcesof proteins are Legumes (including gram \n&gt;soyabean, pulses etc. Costs a=\r\nbout Rs 80 -120 Rs per Kg), Nuts (include almonds \n&gt;cashew etc - Costs need=\r\nn&#39;t mention), Dairy products (Milk being 30-40 Rs per \n&gt;Kg), Grains (cheape=\r\nst sources but not a very complete source), \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In last two years, =\r\ntheir demand rose by 15-20 % but their price rose by \n&gt;40-60%. even at curr=\r\nent price, 60 % of population can not afford a complete \n&gt;balanced diet as =\r\nrecommended by Experts which include 250 Ml of milk, 50-70 gms \n&gt;of legumes=\r\n, 10 gms of vegetables, 150 gms of fruits per person, along with \n&gt;grains a=\r\nnd roughage etc (These are approx minimum quantities. Different sources \n&gt;m=\r\nay quote different quantities). There is average family size of 5 and avera=\r\nge \n&gt;family income is 200 Rs per day! And nutrition is not the only thing n=\r\needed in \n&gt;our life!!! Lot of other expenditures are there\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Even at=\r\n current prices, 60% population can not afford balanced diet. If \n&gt;addition=\r\nal 40% is included in demand of veg sources, price may rise another 100% \n&gt;=\r\nand I need not to explain what will happen at that time.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sir, I am=\r\n not advocating Non-veg food here. I am also a strict vegetarian, \n&gt;even fo=\r\nr milk I prefer a source where there is minimum cruelity (Yes you can not \n=\r\n&gt;expect no cruelity even for milk if you buy it from market and do not prod=\r\nuce it \n&gt;yourself)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Again, I think and believe that practically it =\r\nis impossible to shift all the \n&gt;population to veg sources especially when =\r\nthe agriculture land is decreasing day \n&gt;by day because of many reasons)\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3) Bioavailability or BV of different sources\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is always =\r\na questionable point. because again sections supporting \n&gt;vegetarian diet w=\r\nill highlight the results which support veg food and vice \n&gt;versa. There ar=\r\ne lot of halfbaked researches. but if we think scientifically we \n&gt;will fin=\r\nd that for different sources different sources are better. For example \n&gt;ca=\r\nlcium animal sources are best (Including milk), for albumin Egg is best, fo=\r\nr \n&gt;Vit C veg sources are best, for proteins animal sources are best (Ayurv=\r\neda also \n&gt;support this) So I think we can not say that only veg or non veg=\r\n will suffice \n&gt;the diet. Obviously humans can not survive on Nonveg food a=\r\nlone. As far as BV is \n&gt;concerned I agree with the values given by Rajarshi=\r\n ji.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes, I agree Non veg food increases tamas in mind. But so doe=\r\ns the deep fried \n&gt;vegetarian food, although less but in daily habit it wil=\r\nl not let you escape \n&gt;from Tamas. I agree with Narasimha Ji that if more e=\r\nnergy is used in digesting \n&gt;food, less energy is available for brain. it i=\r\ns a scietific fact that after \n&gt;food, significant blood supply is directed =\r\nto intestines. How much Rajas Spicy \n&gt;food, tea, coffee, coke and Red bull =\r\nis increasing in us? We are what we eat! \n&gt;This is true. So one should eat =\r\nwhat one want to become.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But still at last, I want to mention that=\r\n I am not advocating Non-veg food. I \n&gt;am just highlighting the facts. I am=\r\n a strict vegetarian too. We should \n&gt;understand that we may be right but w=\r\ne should realise that it does not \n&gt;necessarily mean other person is not ri=\r\nght.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Please point out my mistakes I had made in this post. I agree=\r\n that some \n&gt;values i mentioned here may not be exactly as quoted by source=\r\ns. But they are \n&gt;approximate and not too much off the line.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kind =\r\nRegards\n&gt; &gt; Atul\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I disgree with two points you mentioned.

The othe=\r\nr set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After several \n&gt; &gt; &gt; months, researche=\r\nrs found a gap in the intelligence of the two sets. The \n&gt;ones \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fed=\r\n with meat were duller.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If=C3=82=C2=A0you have any references =\r\nfor this, in terms of whether they published \n&gt;any \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; paper on the sa=\r\nme, I am interested to know and analyse that in details. I \n&gt;am \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; op=\r\nen to learning and reviewing my position, provided there is genuine \n&gt;evide=\r\nnce.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Their theory was that digestion of meat takes=\r\n up more energy. Gorillas fed \n&gt;with \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nuts and fruits may have dive=\r\nrted more energy towards the development of \n&gt;brain. \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though they w=\r\nere not sure if the same thing applies to human beings or \n&gt;not,=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0=C3=82=C2=A0a \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maximize one=\r\n&#39;s intellectual \n&gt;development.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is a wrong the=\r\nory as far as human nutrition=C3=82=C2=A0is concerned, because \n&gt;human \n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; stomach structure (gut morphology) is such that it finds certain anima=\r\nl \n&gt;products \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; far easier to digest than most planet based products.=\r\n In my other mail, I \n&gt;have \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; qoted from a couple of research papers=\r\n and books on clinical nutrition and \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dietetics, and if you ask, I c=\r\nan provide more; which may=C3=82=C2=A0take a few days \n&gt;since I \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ha=\r\nve to get them from people who deal with these topics professionally, but \n=\r\n&gt;time \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is not a problem.=C3=82=C2=A0All the papers are=C3=82=C2=A0f=\r\nrom the most accepted and reputed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; scientific=C3=82=C2=A0journals. Th=\r\nere is no confusion. Which is why I said, it is \n&gt;myth \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0vegeterian=C3=82=C2=A0foods are=C3=82=C2=A0easier to digest, if diges=\r\ntibility is the \n&gt;criteria. \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Further, in =\r\nmy experience, I never found traditional vegeterians to be any \n&gt;more \n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; dull or smarter than traditional omnivores. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Animals have their own vaasanas and t=\r\nheir \n&gt;needs. \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. O=\r\ntherwise, feed the poor \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fellow whatever he/she needs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; An animal has a specific physical=C3=82=C2=A0structure and nee=\r\nds to maintain the \n&gt;same. But \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; if trained they can &#39;adjust&#39; to any=\r\n kind of meals. I have seen people \n&gt;feeding \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vegeterian diets to d=\r\nogs. Statistically speaking, an animal whose whole \n&gt;body \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; structur=\r\ne is designed to be a carnivore, may adjust to any food for the \n&gt;sake of \n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; survival, but will become internally weak and susceptable to diseas=\r\ne and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; weaknesses. Who takes the karma for the disease and weakness t=\r\nhat may \n&gt;result \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from an unnatural diet to an animal? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Not that all dogs who are feed a veg diet end up being=\r\n diseased, but the \n&gt;chances \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; increase a lot. It is like not all sm=\r\nokers die of cancer, but smoking makes \n&gt;one \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; susceptible to cancer=\r\n. It increases the probability. Therefore my personal \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; opinion is th=\r\nat an animal if kept at home, it should taken care of in the \n&gt;best \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; way possible, providing it with whatever maybe needed, including the righ=\r\nt \n&gt;diet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; _______________\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A question for you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Scientists studying evolution and human body structures have conc=\r\nluded that \n&gt;meat \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; eating along with cropping and fruits has been p=\r\nrevelant since at least 4 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; million years. That, without a diet which =\r\nwas omnivorous, the structure of \n&gt;the \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; human stomach (lack of a de=\r\nveloped=C3=82=C2=A0caecum),=C3=82=C2=A0and the threefold increase \n&gt;in=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0brain \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; size (from archeological evidences)=C3=82=C2=A0coul=\r\nd never have been what it is \n&gt;today. \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Which means, an omnivorous d=\r\niet has been a=C3=82=C2=A0natural process, so ingrained \n&gt;that it \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nhas changed the very structure of the human body. This cannot be done \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; consciously, but only by the work of natural forces. (Again, if you want,=\r\n I \n&gt;will \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; provide relevent research=C3=82=C2=A0papers to prove my =\r\nclaim).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What is your take on this? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;=\r\nBetween me and You, there is only me. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Take away the me, so only You =\r\nremain&quot; - Hallaj\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ________________________=\r\n________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Thu, 2 December, 2010 12:48:03 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [ved=\r\nic-wisdom] Food we eat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There has been a lot of discussion on food. A few quick comments=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (1) We are we we eat. Production of various chemicals in our=\r\n body and their \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; interactions, are controlled by what we eat. Thus,=\r\n what we eat has a \n&gt;profound \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; impact on us.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (2) Much =\r\nhas been written on the material benefits from vegetarianism. But \n&gt;that \n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is not all. There are spiritual and subtle reasons as well.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Eating the flesh or body parts of an animal that strongly identifies w=\r\nith \n&gt;the \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; physical body entails a karma. Self-identification of pl=\r\nants with their \n&gt;physical \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; body is much subtler and the karma enta=\r\niled in eating plant-based foods is \n&gt;much \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; smaller.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; E=\r\nspecially these days, very cruel methods are used for meat production by \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; corporations and animals are treated very cruelly. Part of the karma f=\r\nor \n&gt;their \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suffering goes to the ones benefiting from their meat.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (3) I heard an interview with a scientist on NPR (National Pub=\r\nlic Radio) \n&gt;several \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; months back. They conducted an experiment on =\r\ngorillas. One set of gorillas \n&gt;was \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fed with meat. The other set w=\r\nas fed with nuts, fruits etc. After several \n&gt; &gt; &gt; months, researchers foun=\r\nd a gap in the intelligence of the two sets. The \n&gt;ones \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fed with m=\r\neat were duller.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Their theory was that digestion of meat takes=\r\n up more energy. Gorillas fed \n&gt;with \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nuts and fruits may have dive=\r\nrted more energy towards the development of \n&gt;brain. \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though they w=\r\nere not sure if the same thing applies to human beings or not, \n&gt;a \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellectual \n&gt;develop=\r\nment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (4) After we eat a heavy meal, we may feel dull or sleep=\r\ny and cannot focus \n&gt;well \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on work that requires alertness and skil=\r\nl. That is because the digestive \n&gt;process \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is using up a lot of en=\r\nergy (also known as agni or fire) and there isn&#39;t \n&gt;much \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; agni avai=\r\nlable for other activities such as digestion of intellectual ideas \n&gt;that \n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happens in the mind. Similarly, digestion of spiritual ideas/experi=\r\nences \n&gt;also \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; requires agni and that cannot happen well. That is wh=\r\ny meditation or homam \n&gt;after \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a heavy meal are fruitless and we ar=\r\ne normally advised to do sadhana before \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; eating.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (5) I=\r\nf foods that light up a higher digestive agni (e.g. meats, deep fried \n&gt;foo=\r\nd \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with more oil, spicy foods that stimulate digestive agni etc) ar=\r\ne consumed \n&gt;more \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; frequently, agni is diverted towards digestion m=\r\nore often and there is less \n&gt;agni \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; available for assimilaring inte=\r\nllectual and spiritual ideas and \n&gt;experiences. If \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one eats saattw=\r\nik food that is very easy to digest (simple grains, simple \n&gt; &gt; &gt; lentils a=\r\nnd simple vegetables, all softly cooked with mild spices, and \n&gt;fruits), \n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; less agni is diverted towards digestion and more agni is available f=\r\nor \n&gt; &gt; &gt; assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and experiences.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (6) Even a big fire cannot burn wet grass well. But huge stacks =\r\nof dry \n&gt;grass may \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be burnt by just one spark! Similarly, little b=\r\nit of internal fire may be \n&gt;enough \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to assimilate spiritual ideas =\r\nand experiences in a person with excellent \n&gt; &gt; &gt; vaasanas and few obstruct=\r\nions (dry grass). A lot of internal fire may be \n&gt;needed \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in a pers=\r\non with poor vaasanas and many obstructions (wet grass). Thus, it \n&gt;all \n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; depends on vaasanas and impurities in nadis and chakras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n One person may eat meat and deep fried foods, spend a lot of agni on \n&gt;dig=\r\nesting \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them and yet make excellent spiritual progress. Another per=\r\nson may eat \n&gt;saattwik \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; food, maximize the agni available for spiri=\r\ntual transformation and yet \n&gt;struggle \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to progress spiritually. Ho=\r\nwever, the best course of action for one is to \n&gt;ignore \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; counter-ex=\r\namples and be a vegetarian. All other things being equal, that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; maxim=\r\nizes the agni available for spiritual progress.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (7) Regarding =\r\nPriya&#39;s question: Animals have their own vaasanas and their \n&gt;needs. \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the p=\r\noor \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fellow whatever he/she needs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (8) One should eat =\r\nto live and not live to eat. A yogi should consume \n&gt;enough \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; food t=\r\no sustain oneself so that one can fulfil one&#39;s dharma in the material \n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; world using physical body and make spiritual progress. Eating too much =\r\nfood \n&gt;is \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not good for spiritual sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Instead of =\r\novereating most of the time and fasting on specific days, it is \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bet=\r\nter to eat limited amount always. Regular practices are more important \n&gt;fo=\r\nr \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; transformation and success, than occasional practices.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; (9) By merely thinking that god is the doer of all actions or consideri=\r\nng \n&gt;food \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to be god&#39;s prasad, one cannot escape the karma involved=\r\n. It depends on how \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; deeply ingrained that thought is and how deepl=\r\ny one feels so. If one \n&gt;internally \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; feels 100% that god is acting =\r\nthrough one and whatever one is doing (e.g. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; eating) is just god&#39;s pr=\r\nasad to one, then one is free.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free =\r\nJyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Your=\r\nself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms=\r\n.org \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-421095106-1291294545=:81331\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;=\r\nfont-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Dear Utpal,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;A=\r\ndding a few&nbsp;comments from my&nbsp;side on the science aspect of the de=\r\nbate:-&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;Vitamin B12 is not easily ava=\r\nilable from the plant source which is actually plenty in Eggs.

In both counts, milk and yogu=\r\nrt fall short as has been seen often (which is still not a problem if corre=\r\nct quantity is there in intake, but how many people drink enough milk or ha=\r\nve enough yogurt on a daily basis?), not to forget the fact that the cost i=\r\ns far more prohibitive&nbsp;for a poor man. Same with essential amino acids=\r\n. The veg sources of the same are far more costly, and the reason for this =\r\nis the rarity of&nbsp;the means by which they have to be&nbsp;acquired comp=\r\nared to the non vegeterian sources.&nbsp;Thus&nbsp;bio-avaiabilty, which is=\r\n a key factor in determining organic sources of food, is clear why&nbsp;mea=\r\nt/fish/egg is&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;and became a part of standard diets way w=\r\nay back.&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Anyway, if someone wants to ignore science, t=\r\nhat is fine. But not everyone can. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;In science, at lea=\r\nst in the science of nutrition,&nbsp;it is never about a argument&nbsp;vs b=\r\n argument. The confusion has been created in the last decade by motivated v=\r\negans, cherry picking and&nbsp;misquoting&nbsp;from research papers to suit=\r\n a view point. The&nbsp;scientists who&nbsp;study&nbsp;nutrition and dietet=\r\nics, have no such confusions. A 4 year course in ditetics and clinical nutr=\r\nition&nbsp;in the best universities in the world will teach the same things=\r\n, that without animal proteint diet&nbsp;assimilation becomes weak and unba=\r\nlanced, not to mention the&nbsp;fact that&nbsp;they (veg alternatives)&nbsp=\r\n;are not&nbsp;as organic or&nbsp;rampantly available, plus the prohibitive&=\r\nnbsp;cost factor. That the gut structure of humans are ideally&nbsp;suited =\r\nfor omnivorous diets, that human cropping and animal protien intake was res=\r\nponsible for the three times increase in brain mass from the times of Austr=\r\nalopithecus afarensis, roughly 4 to 6 million\n years ago, that the lack of =\r\ncaecum cannot make humans digest plant cellulose easily etc etc...&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Obviously, Nature had a good reason for making humans turn omn=\r\nivorous.&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;___________&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;About&nbsp;t=\r\nhe ethical aspects, it is difficult to debate on them because everyone has =\r\nan outlook and worldview which maybe different, plus, there is too much sen=\r\ntimentalism. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;-Best regards&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: tim=\r\nes new roman, new york, times, serif&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 5px;=\r\n FONT-SIZE: 12pt; MARGIN: 5px 0px 5px 5px; BORDER-LEFT: #1010ff 2px solid; =\r\nFONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, serif&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DTahoma s=\r\nize=3D2&gt;\n&lt;HR SIZE=3D1&gt;\n&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B=\r\n&gt; vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEI=\r\nGHT: bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D=\r\n&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Thu, 2 December, 2010 4:43:49 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\n&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; [vedic-wisdom] Re: F=\r\nood we eat&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;DISPLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV =\r\nid=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Few more thoughts on the ongoing subject=E2=80=A6&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;There is hardly any utility to bring science in this issue to prove points=\r\n on either side.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1) For e.g., Vitamin B12 is not easily available fr=\r\nom the plant source which is actually plenty in Eggs. On the other side the=\r\n Vegetarians can get that from Yoghurt, Cheese and such foods. And such man=\r\ny points can be discussed from both the sides.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2) Few of the Argumen=\r\nts of Vegetarians and vegans is that of &quot;Formation of Teeth&quot;, &quot;Formation of=\r\n Intestines&quot; etc=E2=80=A6 They say that Human teeth formation and digestive=\r\n systems are not suitable for diet from the source of Animals. They site th=\r\ne examples of a Hoarse, cow, Elephant, Goat, buffalo and compare that with =\r\nHumans. Which I found not proved when I see people around me. Majority of t=\r\nhe population today and earlier are meat eaters and there does not seem any=\r\n noticeable physical difference which suggest any difficulties for them. It=\r\n is also noticed that\n because of High protein contents, they are well buil=\r\nt. Same way Physical strength, stamina, recovery from Illness and such were=\r\n never issues with generations of people in India and else where who never =\r\nused meat and sea food in their diet.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So science will not be able to=\r\n give definitive answer for some one to decide between 2 strict options, un=\r\nless science proves without a doubt, that a certain disease or a Physical a=\r\nilment or a mental abnormality is only because of *eating meat* or *NOT eat=\r\ning meat* and that should also clearly visible in practical cases which aff=\r\nect large section of masses. Till that time, so called science, will mainly=\r\n be used as a tool to debate on this issue of vegetarianism and Non-vegetar=\r\nianism because we do see that Diabetic ailment, Cardiac patients, Blood pre=\r\nssure problems and such many commonly seen diseases are found in all sectio=\r\nns of society irrespective of meat eaters or vegetarians. Both sections are=\r\n living their\n lives for Generations and generations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Regarding Holi=\r\nstic approach, ethics, Low of Karma etc=E2=80=A6&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1) One of My very c=\r\nlose doctor friend who is a pediatric surgeon (M.Ch. in Pediatrics) and a s=\r\ntrict vegetarian who also obviously contains a vast knowledge of medical sc=\r\nience gave me a certain interesting fact. During his studies, their batch w=\r\nas once taken to a place called Deonar in Mumbai, (where there is one of th=\r\ne biggest Slaughter houses of India. Daily around 4000 various animals are =\r\nslaughtered to meet the need of Maharashtra and to some extent India and 60=\r\n% is exported mainly to Arab countries). 4 or 5 females from their batch co=\r\nuld not stand the process of slaughtering and they fell unconscious. Almost=\r\n everybody including himself was shocked and disgusted to see the slaughter=\r\nhouse and left the place with heavy hearts.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2) There are meat eaters=\r\n who are well advanced in spiritual path and there are vegetarians who are =\r\nutterly\n selfish and deep down in materialism hence I refrain to talk on th=\r\nat line. Only I wish to say one thing that ethics, spirituality and such te=\r\nrms should not be used selectively as per our own conveniences. Something w=\r\nhich is unethical will remain unethical. To me, Killing animals, while bett=\r\ner alternate sources are available, to satiate hunger and far worst, to tic=\r\nkle the palate, is Unethical and simply unethical, be it or Earth or on Mar=\r\ns, be it Kaliyuga or Satyuga.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3) Solution is not to look if a Famous=\r\n Saint or Philosopher or any body, famous or otherwise, approves meat eatin=\r\ng or disproves it or suggests middle approach, it does not make any differe=\r\nnce. If Vimalananda emphatically suggest not to eat meat or otherwise (Vima=\r\nlananda was very clear for meat eating though), does not make any differenc=\r\ne. Law of Karma might be infinitely complex and might need deepest of under=\r\nstanding but that does not suggest any thing. Who knows if next birth is\n t=\r\nhere or not? However what really suggestive and decisively suggestive shoul=\r\nd be our own Instincts, our own thinking, our own rationale, our own heart.=\r\n Why depend upon any body coming and telling us about if we should eat meat=\r\n or should not. Why not follow our own conscious and rationale. I do not kn=\r\now if I kill a Goat and eat meat of the same, in the next life or lives, I =\r\nwill be killed by the same Goat and I have to go through the same pain. Har=\r\ndly anybody knows that but when it comes to the present, I know for sure th=\r\nat the meat I am eating has been of an animal that has been butchered merci=\r\nlessly. That much is known without a doubt and that should make me think. I=\r\nf *avoidable*, I must not eat that. It is that simple. Do not need further =\r\napproval of anybody and no amount of arguments from Science or culture or r=\r\neligions or whatever should stand for me. Do I need to even look at those? =\r\nNO.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Utpal&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A\n href=3D&quot;mailto:vedi=\r\nc-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailt=\r\no:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;vedic_=\r\npathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste Atul Ji and=\r\n List members,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;I am not advocating Non-veg food. I am&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;just highlighting the facts. I am a strict vegetarian too. We &=\r\ngt;should understand that we may be right but we should realize that &gt;it=\r\n does not &gt;necessarily mean other person is not right.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nMy views are there on this subject in archives. I wanted to stay away but s=\r\ntill inspired to write at least one message on the same.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1=\r\n) Using Arguments based on science, BV, so many of researches and plenty of=\r\n informations available on the Internet, One will never be able to come to =\r\na definitive conclusions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2) I never argue with people (ev=\r\nen when I was aggressive and passionate about the Idea\n of vegetarian food)=\r\n with the above basis.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Whatever said and done, people will continue=\r\n eating meat, eggs, Fish, Other seafood and probably Human flash as well. I=\r\n have, with experience, understood that there is no point in arguing with p=\r\neople giving various Data. Each side will have their own arguments, own set=\r\ns of Data and own Counter Ideas to prove their point.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 3) I=\r\nnstead I appeal their conscious! I tell people around me, whenever the Topi=\r\nc comes up, only one simple thing - &quot;I dont want to kill for filling up my =\r\nStomach&quot; and I say it from my heart. I tell people that Put a knife edge on=\r\n your own Throat or Cut a finger only a little, feel the pain and now reali=\r\nze the Plight of a butchered Chicken or a Goat or a cow or a buffalo or a..=\r\n.., Suffocate yourself by closing Nose &amp; Mouth and see after only a few=\r\n seconds, how you pent for the Air and Now realize the &quot;Chhatpataahat&quot; of a=\r\n fish forced out of water.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; And\n all these, because one wis=\r\nh to fill the stomach or satisfy cravings of a habitual palate or both. Eve=\r\nn vegetarians have their cravings of spice and other food stuff but the ver=\r\ny vital difference is that such craving does not need killing!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; 4) Just to give a result, One of colleagues, who is a Srilankan, has l=\r\neft eating meat since 6 Months now and surely, one of the reasons for his l=\r\neaving meat is because I told my views him a few times when such discussion=\r\ns came up and I even told him that you are a Buddhist, the religion of Non-=\r\nInjury and see what has happened to that very Idea. Hats-off to him for he =\r\nreally seems to have thought about it and dared to change his swabhava whic=\r\nh is so very difficult.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Just to clarify, I do not hesitate to expre=\r\nss my views even to Muslims and others and at least, this idea is appreciat=\r\ned by them even if grudgingly. The Hard core meat eaters are also taken a b=\r\nack with this idea. All though they know\n from their hearts of hearts, it c=\r\nomes as a shock even to them when somebody boldly brings that up. Most of u=\r\ns are like a cat that drinks the milk with closed eyes. The Idea would have=\r\n gone in their mind and that is enough. One day probably it will germinate.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 5) Finally, The point is not to say that this side is goo=\r\nd and that side is bad. It&#39;ll be a foolish and unpalatable conclusion. It i=\r\ns to just appeal the inside human of each individual, It is to appeal the r=\r\national Intelligence of an Individual, It is to appeal the heart of a perso=\r\nn and if that is not suffice to our ultra-hardened heart then a final remin=\r\nder of &quot;Law of Cause and effect -The Law of Karma&quot; at least to those of us =\r\nwho believe in Natures unfailing governance. And that is the final Idea.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Utpal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow\n ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;=\r\n&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;Dr. A.

Please po=\r\nint out my mistakes I will make in this process.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n We are trying to discuss three points here&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 1) C=\r\nhoosing a dietary habit&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 2) Dependence of Human population on N=\r\non-veg sources of nutrition&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 3) bioavailability or BV of Non ve=\r\ng vs Veg food.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I commented on two points &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 1) Choosing a dietary habit &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 2) Dependenc=\r\ne of Human population on non veg sources of nutrition&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; 1) Choosing a\n Dietary habit&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; One should ch=\r\noose his dietary habit based on his varna (aptitude and attitude) and goal =\r\nin his life. He should not bother what the BV or other factor or research s=\r\nays. For an athlete, Eggs are important part of his training. and for a per=\r\nson seeking spirituality one should stick to vegetarian food unless he is a=\r\nble to rise above the difference in veg and nonveg. I agree with Narasimha =\r\nJi about this point.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In some diseases Non veg so=\r\nurces play an very important role (Although not a necessasity) like in Albu=\r\nmin deficiency two eggs per day can save a person from costly (3000Rs per I=\r\nnj) Albumin Injections. In TB, Soup made of goat meat do wonders. Ayurveda =\r\nalso recommend it strongly Charak Samhita) etc.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n2) Dependence of Human population on non veg sources of nutrition&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I agree with the link provided in this discussions. Books=\r\n and articles\n by Peta members are far more convincing for switching to Veg=\r\n sources. I can also provide tens of links and book reference which oppose =\r\ntheir view. Honestly, I do not believe each and every information on net an=\r\nd not every book written about nutirtion, just like astrology. Let us leave=\r\n this debate aside and look at other aspect of it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; By &#39;Practically impossible&#39; I meant the cost factor and demand/supply fa=\r\nctor. In India (Leave other high Nonveg consuming countries alone) about 45=\r\n% people are Non vegetarian and about 40% demand of Proteins are supplied b=\r\ny Non veg sources. Currently, Important veg sourcesof proteins are Legumes =\r\n(including gram soyabean, pulses etc. Costs about Rs 80 -120 Rs per Kg), Nu=\r\nts (include almonds cashew etc - Costs needn&#39;t mention), Dairy products (Mi=\r\nlk being 30-40 Rs per Kg), Grains (cheapest sources but not a very complete=\r\n source), &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In last two years, their demand rose =\r\nby\n 15-20 % but their price rose by 40-60%. even at current price, 60 % of =\r\npopulation can not afford a complete balanced diet as recommended by Expert=\r\ns which include 250 Ml of milk, 50-70 gms of legumes, 10 gms of vegetables,=\r\n 150 gms of fruits per person, along with grains and roughage etc (These ar=\r\ne approx minimum quantities. Different sources may quote different quantiti=\r\nes). There is average family size of 5 and average family income is 200 Rs =\r\nper day! And nutrition is not the only thing needed in our life!!! Lot of o=\r\nther expenditures are there&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Even at current pric=\r\nes, 60% population can not afford balanced diet. If additional 40% is inclu=\r\nded in demand of veg sources, price may rise another 100% and I need not to=\r\n explain what will happen at that time.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sir, I a=\r\nm not advocating Non-veg food here. I am also a strict vegetarian, even for=\r\n milk I prefer a source where there is minimum cruelity (Yes you can\n not e=\r\nxpect no cruelity even for milk if you buy it from market and do not produc=\r\ne it yourself)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Again, I think and believe that p=\r\nractically it is impossible to shift all the population to veg sources espe=\r\ncially when the agriculture land is decreasing day by day because of many r=\r\neasons)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 3) Bioavailability or BV of different so=\r\nurces&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; It is always a questionable point. because=\r\n again sections supporting vegetarian diet will highlight the results which=\r\n support veg food and vice versa. There are lot of halfbaked researches. bu=\r\nt if we think scientifically we will find that for different sources differ=\r\nent sources are better. For example calcium animal sources are best (Includ=\r\ning milk), for albumin Egg is best, for Vit C veg sources are best, for pro=\r\nteins animal sources are best (Ayurveda also support this) So I think we ca=\r\nn not say that only veg or non veg will suffice the diet.\n Obviously humans=\r\n can not survive on Nonveg food alone. As far as BV is concerned I agree wi=\r\nth the values given by Rajarshi ji.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Yes, I agree=\r\n Non veg food increases tamas in mind. But so does the deep fried vegetaria=\r\nn food, although less but in daily habit it will not let you escape from Ta=\r\nmas. I agree with Narasimha Ji that if more energy is used in digesting foo=\r\nd, less energy is available for brain. it is a scietific fact that after fo=\r\nod, significant blood supply is directed to intestines. How much Rajas Spic=\r\ny food, tea, coffee, coke and Red bull is increasing in us? We are what we =\r\neat! This is true. So one should eat what one want to become.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; But still at last, I want to mention that I am not advocating=\r\n Non-veg food. I am just highlighting the facts. I am a strict vegetarian t=\r\noo. We should understand that we may be right but we should realise that it=\r\n does not necessarily mean other person is not\n right.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; Please point out my mistakes I had made in this post. I agree that s=\r\nome values i mentioned here may not be exactly as quoted by sources. But th=\r\ney are approximate and not too much off the line.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; Kind Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Atul&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wis=\r\ndom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:ved=\r\nic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, rajarshi nan=\r\ndy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste N=\r\narasimha,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I disgree with t=\r\nwo points you mentioned. Let me clarify. (I am only dealing with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; the science part of these discussions, as I had already maintained=\r\n right at the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; beginning).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; (3) I heard an interview with a\n scientist on NPR (Natio=\r\nnal Public Radio) several &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; months back. They conducted an=\r\n experiment on gorillas. One set of gorillas was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; fed wit=\r\nh meat. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After several &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; months, researchers found a gap in the intelligence of the two s=\r\nets. The ones &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; fed with meat were duller.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If=C3=82&nbsp;you have any references for this, in te=\r\nrms of whether they published any &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; paper on the same, I a=\r\nm interested to know and analyse that in details. I am &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; o=\r\npen to learning and reviewing my position, provided there is genuine eviden=\r\nce.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Their theory was that =\r\ndigestion of meat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; nuts and fruits may have diverted more energy towards the development of =\r\nbrain. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Though they were not sure\n if the same thing appl=\r\nies to human beings or not,=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; bal=\r\nanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellectual development.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; This is a wrong theory as =\r\nfar as human nutrition=C3=82&nbsp;is concerned, because human &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; stomach structure (gut morphology) is such that it finds certain anim=\r\nal products &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; far easier to digest than most planet based =\r\nproducts. In my other mail, I have &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; qoted from a couple o=\r\nf research papers and books on clinical nutrition and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; di=\r\netetics, and if you ask, I can provide more; which may=C3=82&nbsp;take a fe=\r\nw days since I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; have to get them from people who deal wit=\r\nh these topics professionally, but time &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; is not a problem=\r\n.=C3=82&nbsp;All the papers are=C3=82&nbsp;from the most accepted and reput=\r\ned &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; scientific=C3=82&nbsp;journals. There is no confusion=\r\n.\n Which is why I said, it is myth &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; that=C3=82&nbsp;veget=\r\nerian=C3=82&nbsp;foods are=C3=82&nbsp;easier to digest, if digestibility is=\r\n the criteria. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; Further, in my experience, I never found traditional vegeterians t=\r\no be any more &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; dull or smarter than traditional omnivores=\r\n. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; (7) =\r\nRegarding Priya&#39;s question: Animals have their own vaasanas and their needs=\r\n. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Oth=\r\nerwise, feed the poor &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; fellow whatever he/she needs.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; An animal has a specific physi=\r\ncal=C3=82&nbsp;structure and needs to maintain the same. But &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; if trained they can &#39;adjust&#39; to any kind of meals. I have seen people =\r\nfeeding &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; vegeterian diets to dogs. Statistically speaking=\r\n, an animal whose whole\n body &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; structure is designed to b=\r\ne a carnivore, may adjust to any food for the sake of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; su=\r\nrvival, but will become internally weak and susceptable to disease and &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; weaknesses. Who takes the karma for the disease and weakness=\r\n that may result &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; from an unnatural diet to an animal? &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Not that=\r\n all dogs who are feed a veg diet end up being diseased, but the chances &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; increase a lot. It is like not all smokers die of cancer, =\r\nbut smoking makes one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; susceptible to cancer. It increase=\r\ns the probability. Therefore my personal &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; opinion is that=\r\n an animal if kept at home, it should taken care of in the best &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; way possible, providing it with whatever maybe needed, including th=\r\ne right diet.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n _______________&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; A question for you.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Scientists studying evolution and human =\r\nbody structures have concluded that meat &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; eating along wi=\r\nth cropping and fruits has been prevelant since at least 4 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; million years. That, without a diet which was omnivorous, the structure =\r\nof the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; human stomach (lack of a developed=C3=82&nbsp;cae=\r\ncum),=C3=82&nbsp;and the threefold increase in=C3=82&nbsp;brain &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; size (from archeological evidences)=C3=82&nbsp;could never have bee=\r\nn what it is today. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Which means, an omnivorous diet has =\r\nbeen a=C3=82&nbsp;natural process, so ingrained that it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nhas changed the very structure of the human body. This cannot be done &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; consciously, but only by the work of natural forces. (Again, =\r\nif you want, I will &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n provide relevent research=C3=82&nbs=\r\np;papers to prove my claim).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; What is your take on this? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Between me and You, there is only me. &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Take away the me, so only You remain&quot; - Hallaj&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; ________________________________&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Ra=\r\no &lt;pvr@&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoo=\r\ngroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%4=\r\n0yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: =\r\nThu, 2 December, 2010 12:48:03 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom]=\r\n Food we eat&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; Namaste friends,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n There has bee=\r\nn a lot of discussion on food.

Thus, what we eat has a profound &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; impact on us.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; (2) Much has been written on the material =\r\nbenefits from vegetarianism. But that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; is not all. There =\r\nare spiritual and subtle reasons as well.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; Eating the flesh or body parts of an animal that strongly identifies wi=\r\nth the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; physical body entails a karma. Self-identificatio=\r\nn of plants with their physical &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; body is much subtler and=\r\n the karma entailed in eating plant-based foods is much &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nsmaller.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Especially these days, very c=\r\nruel methods are used for meat production by &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; &gt; corporatio=\r\nns and animals are treated very cruelly. Part of the karma for their &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; suffering goes to the ones benefiting from their meat.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; (3) I heard an interview with a scientist on =\r\nNPR (National Public Radio) several &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; months back. They co=\r\nnducted an experiment on gorillas. One set of gorillas was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; fed with meat. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After severa=\r\nl &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; months, researchers found a gap in the intelligence of=\r\n the two sets. The ones &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; fed with meat were duller.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Their theory was that digestion of meat tak=\r\nes up more energy. Gorillas fed with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; nuts and fruits may=\r\n have diverted more energy towards the development of brain. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Though they were not sure if the same thing applies to human beings or=\r\n not, a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; balanced vegetarian\n diet perhaps can maximize o=\r\nne&#39;s intellectual development.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; (4) Aft=\r\ner we eat a heavy meal, we may feel dull or sleepy and cannot focus well &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; on work that requires alertness and skill. That is because=\r\n the digestive process &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; is using up a lot of energy (also=\r\n known as agni or fire) and there isn&#39;t much &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; agni availa=\r\nble for other activities such as digestion of intellectual ideas that &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; happens in the mind. Similarly, digestion of spiritual ideas/=\r\nexperiences also &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; requires agni and that cannot happen we=\r\nll. That is why meditation or homam after &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; a heavy meal a=\r\nre fruitless and we are normally advised to do sadhana before &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; eating.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; (5) If foods that light =\r\nup a higher digestive agni (e.g. meats, deep fried food &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nwith more oil, spicy foods that\n stimulate digestive agni etc) are consumed=\r\n more &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; frequently, agni is diverted towards digestion mor=\r\ne often and there is less agni &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; available for assimilarin=\r\ng intellectual and spiritual ideas and experiences. If &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; o=\r\nne eats saattwik food that is very easy to digest (simple grains, simple &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; lentils and simple vegetables, all softly cooked with mild=\r\n spices, and fruits), &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; less agni is diverted towards dige=\r\nstion and more agni is available for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; assimilaring intell=\r\nectual and spiritual ideas and experiences.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; (6) Even a big fire cannot burn wet grass well. But huge stacks of dr=\r\ny grass may &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; be burnt by just one spark! Similarly, littl=\r\ne bit of internal fire may be enough &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to assimilate spiri=\r\ntual ideas and experiences in a person with excellent &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; va=\r\nasanas and few\n obstructions (dry grass). A lot of internal fire may be nee=\r\nded &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; in a person with poor vaasanas and many obstructions=\r\n (wet grass). Thus, it all &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; depends on vaasanas and impur=\r\nities in nadis and chakras.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; One person=\r\n may eat meat and deep fried foods, spend a lot of agni on digesting &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; them and yet make excellent spiritual progress. Another person=\r\n may eat saattwik &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; food, maximize the agni available for =\r\nspiritual transformation and yet struggle &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to progress sp=\r\niritually. However, the best course of action for one is to ignore &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; counter-examples and be a vegetarian. All other things being equ=\r\nal, that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; maximizes the agni available for spiritual prog=\r\nress.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: =\r\nAnimals have their own vaasanas and their needs. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If an a=\r\nnimal\n can survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; fellow whatever he/she needs.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; (8) One should eat to live and not live to eat. A yogi should consume=\r\n enough &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; food to sustain oneself so that one can fulfil o=\r\nne&#39;s dharma in the material &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; world using physical body an=\r\nd make spiritual progress. Eating too much food is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; not g=\r\nood for spiritual sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Instead of =\r\novereating most of the time and fasting on specific days, it is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; better to eat limited amount always. Regular practices are more imp=\r\nortant for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; transformation and success, than occasional p=\r\nractices.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; (9) By merely thinking that =\r\ngod is the doer of all actions or considering food &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to be=\r\n god&#39;s prasad, one cannot escape the karma involved. It depends on how\n &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; deeply ingrained that thought is and how deeply one feels s=\r\no. If one internally &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; feels 100% that god is acting throu=\r\ngh one and whatever one is doing (e.g. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; eating) is just g=\r\nod&#39;s prasad to one, then one is free.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nBest regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish =\r\nSoftware, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It =\r\nYourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofoll=\r\now&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a d=\r\nifference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnof=\r\nollow&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;A hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank\n rel=3Dnof=\r\nollow&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Jyot=\r\nish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; tar=\r\nget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/=\r\nA&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=\r\n=3Dtext/css&gt;\n&lt;!--\n#ygrp-mkp {\nborder:1px solid #d8d8d8;font-family:Arial;ma=\r\nrgin:10px 0;padding:0 10px;}\n\n#ygrp-mkp hr {\nborder:1px solid #d8d8d8;}\n\n#y=\r\ngrp-mkp #hd {\ncolor:#628c2a;font-size:85%;font-weight:700;line-height:122%;=\r\nmargin:10px 0;}\n\n#ygrp-mkp #ads {\nmargin-bottom:10px;}\n\n#ygrp-mkp .ad {\npad=\r\nding:0 0;}\n\n#ygrp-mkp .ad p {\nmargin:0;}\n\n#ygrp-mkp .ad a {\ncolor:#0000ff;t=\r\next-decoration:none;}\n#ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc {\nfont-family:Arial;}\n\n#ygrp-s=\r\nponsor #ygrp-lc #hd {\nmargin:10px 0px;font-weight:700;font-size:78%;line-he=\r\night:122%;}\n\n#ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc .ad {\nmargin-bottom:10px;padding:0 0;}\n=\r\n\na {\ncolor:#1e66ae;}\n\n#actions {\nfont-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;padding=\r\n:10px 0;}\n\n#activity {\nbackground-color:#e0ecee;float:left;font-family:Verd=\r\nana;font-size:10px;padding:10px;}\n\n#activity span {\nfont-weight:700;}\n\n#act=\r\nivity span:first-child {\ntext-transform:uppercase;}\n\n#activity span \n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
