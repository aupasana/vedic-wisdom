But, are they really one&#39;s own words and one&#39;s own ideas? One expresses what one has realized based on reading various masters, discussing with one&#39;s guru(s), meditating, contemplating and eventually digesting that knowledge.\n\nThus, I see nothing wrong in quoting a great saint or a yogi, as opposed to writing one&#39;s own thoughts.\n\nI started this list to share my thoughts on various spiritual matters. Based on my own experiences, I could finally make sense of various seemingly contradictory things I had read. I could put it all together in my mind and have a uniform, consistent, coherent and integrated understanding that put various things in the correct perspective. I wanted to promote such a wholesome and integrated understanding and do my part in &quot;bridging&quot; various &quot;islands&quot; of spiritual wisdom that exist out there. The other goal of this forum is to remove some fundamental confusions and misunderstandings that may be blocking some people from doing spiritual sadhana and making spiritual progress and encourage some people to do spiritual sadhana.\n\nIf words of a great yogi or saint that promote the same goal are shared, I see nothing wrong in it. The only thing is I request people to go a bit slow and not post too many such mails on the same day. Some people may be overwhelmed by the traffic and just delete the mails. One can slowly cover the ground one wants to cover, over a period of time. So please limit such posts.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n\n---- naaraayana_iyer &lt;narayan.iyer@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste Prasad,\n&gt; \n&gt; I guess he has the right to post what he wants.
