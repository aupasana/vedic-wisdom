In fact, this is a question that was =\r\nraised by disciples of Sri Sri than those that dont know him. In fact, if o=\r\nne looks into it, one will be dumbfounded! How is it that somebody like Sri=\r\n Sri, who has commented exhaustively on several scriptures, who is an autho=\r\nrity on vedanta both by his inner Realization and learning, who recited the=\r\n Bhagavad Gita when he was 4 years old without anybody teaching him, and wh=\r\no gives impromptu discourses in various forums across the world on all topi=\r\ncs under the sun shy away from explaining some simple questions that are ab=\r\nout his home turf?\n\nThe answer is that Sri Sri did not debate. He never deb=\r\nates on Truth! To him Truth / God is not an article of debate. He can show =\r\nthe way to Realization of Truth to those that are ready. He is not interest=\r\ned in anything else. He answers only when there is sincerity in the heart o=\r\nf the questioner. Otherwise he would say some polite words and let it pass,=\r\n however big the occasion may be. Most of the questions that were raised in=\r\n that meeting were answered elaborately by Sri Sri in his various commentar=\r\nies & discourses year ago!\n\nOne may ask why then did he go to this meeting =\r\nor whatever it was? The topic of the meeting was something like &quot;Concept of=\r\n God in Hinduism and Islam&quot;. IMHO, Sri Sri did justice to the topic by &quot;BEI=\r\nNG&quot; an embodiment of the very thing that was supposedly the topic of discus=\r\nsion. Those that were ready to benefit from it from the audience would have=\r\n benefited. \n\n************\n\nThe below part is not for Rajarshi but may be o=\r\nf interest to everyone, especially those among us that are intellectually c=\r\nurious about spirituality than practicing it. \n\nSri Sri always practices &quot;e=\r\nxperience first and explanation and knowledge later&quot; principle. Sometimes i=\r\nn AOL, there will be big congregation of thousands of people and Sri Sri wi=\r\nll only say very simple things or share some simple jokes and laughs, but h=\r\nis presence would convey what needs to be conveyed for those that are recep=\r\ntive. A Master may not be interested in getting 100,000 people trading one =\r\nmental concept for another, but prefers one sincere person opening up to Tr=\r\nuth in silence. A Masters mere presence is enough for that to happen. Words=\r\n are secondary and optional. In spiritual discussions,  the point of words =\r\nis to create inner silence or illumination and if that is not created, ther=\r\ne is no point in talking! \n\nIt is a great privilege and an immense blessing=\r\n to be in the presence of a living Master whether it is Sri Sri or someone =\r\nelse. We gain immensely if we listen to them from our Being instead of our =\r\nmind. In Sri Ramakrishna&#39;s life, there are innumerable examples of very sim=\r\nple people benefiting from his mere looks & presence while big intellectual=\r\ns would debate with him and miss the opportunity of a lifetime. Sometimes w=\r\nhen he countered insincere queries, Sri Ramakrishna would feign ignorance a=\r\nnd say what would I know - I am an illiterate! What a disaster it would hav=\r\ne been for a seeker if he were to label Sri Ramakrishna as an illiterate an=\r\nd ignoramus!\n\nWithout an accompanying experience (at least a small glimpse =\r\nor even a fragment of an experience) accumulating knowledge can be very dan=\r\ngerous as it will become yet another mental concept and will actually be a =\r\nhindrance to the Sadhak. Some of the most subtle and dangerous hindrances f=\r\nor a sadhak are created by none other than the sadhak&#39;s empty concepts of s=\r\npirituality and God! Things like lust, greed, anger, etc., stand out conspi=\r\ncuously and are in that way less dangerous. \n\nJai Gurudev!\n   Siva.\n\n--- In=\r\n vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; D=\r\near Siva,\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; Nice mail.

Sri Sri Ravishankar maybe an enlightened master but he just cannot de=\r\nbate.

And when he fails miserably on stage, it becom=\r\nes shameful to watch for hindus.

I occasionally vi=\r\nsit this forum. I happened to see several emails about AOL and the below em=\r\nail from Shri. Narasimha.\n&gt; &gt; As a follower of AOL&#39;s spiritual practices an=\r\nd as a disciple and devotee of Sri Sri Ravishankar, I want to clarify a few=\r\n things to the extent of my understanding.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There are several paths=\r\n each leading to the destination of Sat-Chit-Ananda. Some are ritualistic, =\r\nsome use austerities, some use devotion, etc. AOL is a path, where the path=\r\n to Bliss is also blissful. That does not make it in any way inferior to pa=\r\nths of austerities. As Sri Aurobindo would call it, it is a &quot;Sunlit path&quot;. =\r\nIn this path one does not suddenly emerge into SatChitAnanda. The personali=\r\nty of the sadhak is transformed slowly and the sadhak radiates more and mor=\r\ne as they progress more and more.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In my experience, AOL is a seaml=\r\ness blend of Raja yoga, Bhakti yoga, Karma yoga and Gnana yoga. Spritual pr=\r\nactice in AOL is not just doing Sudarshan Kriya everyday as it is commonly =\r\n(mis)understood. Pranayams and Sudarshan Kriya are done for cleansing and s=\r\nettling of the mind and preparing for meditation and doing other spiritual =\r\npractices of contemplation, Seva for rest of the day wit the right attitude=\r\n. Regular practice of Sudarshan Kriya removes / breaks old patterns and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; AOL includes some yoga asanas to prepare the body (the Padma Sadhana =\r\nsequence of asanas taught in DSN course and Sun Salutations (Surya Namaskar=\r\n) taught in Part II or advance courses fall under this category.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nhe raja yoga practices include all the pranayams, Sudarshan Kriya, mudras, =\r\nbandhas, meditations taught in Art of Living course, advance courses, Sahaj=\r\n samadhi meditation course, etc.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Knowledge part includes deep =\r\ncontemplative study and imbibing of Narada Bhakti Sutras, Patanjali Yoga Su=\r\ntras, Ashtavakra Gita and Bhagavat Gita. Sri Sri Ravishankar has given very=\r\n elaborate commentary on all of the above. His commentary on Bhakti Sutras =\r\nruns to 30 or so tapes and the publicly available commentary on Ashtavakra =\r\ngita runs to over 33 DVD episodes! Besides daily study of Yoga Vashishtam i=\r\ns highly\n&gt; &gt; recommended. Learning and contemplation of this Wisdom is mand=\r\natory for those that strive to become Art of Living teachers.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The =\r\npath of AOL emphasises on Surrender and Seva. Guru puja to Guru parampara, =\r\nnama sankeertan and bhajans are a standard feature of AOL satsangs.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Some wonder why AOL charges for these courses and some wonder about lack =\r\nof a Sadhguru at every stage.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Let me clarify from my personal expe=\r\nriences that Sri Sri Ravishankar is a fully Enlightened Master living in Sa=\r\nhaj Samadhi all times. He is capable of guiding millions of devotees in eve=\r\nry step of the sadhana without having to be near them in person. Several ge=\r\nt necessary guidance in dreams (I myself had that experience twice), some i=\r\nn person and several via various other ways. However, to get these guidance=\r\n, an inner connection with the Master is essential. Until that stage, the v=\r\narious AOL courses, Sri Sri&#39;s elaborate and in-depth commentaries on variou=\r\ns Knowledge are more than enough to guide disciples to a stage where consci=\r\nous inner communion with Guru can be established.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Several of the s=\r\nenior AOL teachers (mostly Swamis and Rishis) are yogis of a very high orde=\r\nr capable of reaching SatChitAnanda consciousness at will during meditation=\r\n. They may be not fully established in it like Sri Sri, but act as channels=\r\n of the SatGuru and can appropriate guide a Sadhak as and when needed.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; It is very easy to accept those that left their body as having achieve=\r\nd highest realization such as Sri Aurobindo or Sri Ramakrishna or Ramana Ma=\r\nharishi. However it is a human tendency to doubt them when they are in phys=\r\nical form.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regarding AOL charging money for its courses: AOL is wo=\r\nrld&#39;s largest volunteer run organization. Neither AOL teachers nor its foun=\r\nder Sri Sri Ravishankar make monitory profits. All the proceeds go to the c=\r\nharitable activities again run by volunteers. Many of the full time teacher=\r\ns have given up veyr lucrative careers and millions worth in property to be=\r\ncome teachers and teach for free. Sri Sri Ravishankar neither needs all the=\r\n money. All senior AOL teachers including Sri Sri have went through very ba=\r\nd and sometimes even dangerous conditions to bring the Knowledge to the mas=\r\nses. This is a time when the highest Knowledge needs to be revealed to maxi=\r\nmum number of people.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Senior AOL teachers have faced danger to the=\r\nir lives by going without any help or guidance to areas infested with naxal=\r\nites, terrorists in North East, Kashmir, Iraq, Palestine, Pakitan, Sri Lank=\r\na, etc. with nothing but love and Divine Grace as their aid.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As fa=\r\nr as I know, money is charged in AOL courses for two reasons.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) P=\r\nast experience showed that those that paid for the courses seem to follow t=\r\nhe practices more diligently. It is Sri Sri&#39;s guidance that no deserving pe=\r\nrson should be denied a course because they cannot afford to pay. As a volu=\r\nnteer, I was part of organizing several AOL courses and know first hand man=\r\ny cases where people took courses for free and were also provided free acco=\r\nmmodation, etc. Whenever natural disaster strikes, AOL teachers go there pa=\r\nying from their own pocket or by AOL and teach courses for free and provide=\r\n healing to the victims. AOL does not advertise it or make a show of it.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) This is my understanding and not AOl position. It removes the Kar=\r\nmic debt to the AOL teachers and volunteers who still may have some doershi=\r\np in them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Finally, Sri Sri is only interested in getting everyone=\r\n turn inwards and express the love, joy and compassion that is inside every=\r\none. As long as one follows a path, any path and surrenders to any Sat Guru=\r\n, we are happy.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jai Gurudev!\n&gt; &gt; Siva.\n\n\n"}}
