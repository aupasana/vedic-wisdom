We have seen that It is even beyond the intellect.We\nlearn =\r\nfrom the same Upanishad that this Self is eternal and omnipresent,\nthat you=\r\n and I and all of us are omnipresent beings, and that the Self is\nchangeles=\r\ns. Now this omnipresent Being can be only one. There cannot be two\nbeings w=\r\nho are equally omnipresent =97 how could that be? There cannot be two\nbeing=\r\ns who are infinite, and the result is, there is really only one Self,\nand y=\r\nou, I, and the whole universe are but one, appearing as many. &quot;As the\none f=\r\nire entering into the world manifests itself in various ways, even so\nthat =\r\none Self, the Self of all, manifests Itself in every form.&quot;\n\nBut the questi=\r\non is: If this Self is perfect and pure, and the One Being of\nthe universe,=\r\n what becomes of It when It goes into the impure body, the\nwicked body, the=\r\n good body, and so on? How can It remain perfect? &quot;The one\nsun is the cause=\r\n of vision in every eye, yet it is not touched by the\ndefects in the eyes o=\r\nf any.&quot; If a man has jaundice he sees everything as\nyellow; the cause of hi=\r\ns vision is the sun, but his seeing everything as\nyellow does not touch the=\r\n sun.\n\nThere the sun shines not, nor the stars, nor the lightning flashes, =\r\nwhat to\nspeak of fire? He shining, everything shines; through His light eve=\r\nrything\nbecomes effulgent. When all the desires that trouble the heart ceas=\r\ne, then\nthe mortal becomes immortal, and here one attains Brahman.\n\nThis Is=\r\n the one fundamental idea in the Vedas, that our search in the stars,\nthe n=\r\nebulae, the Milky Way, in the whole of this external universe leads to\nnoth=\r\ning, never solves the problem of life and death. The wonderful mechanism\nin=\r\nside had to be analysed, and it revealed to them the secret of the\nuniverse=\r\n; nor star or sun could do it. Man had to be anatomised; not the\nbody, but =\r\nthe soul of man. In that soul they found the answer. What was the\nanswer th=\r\ney found? That behind the body, behind even the mind, there is the\nself-exi=\r\nstent One.He dies not, nor is He born. The self-existent One it\nomnipresent=\r\n, because He has no form. That which has no form or shape, that\nwhich is no=\r\nt limited by space or time, cannot live in a certain place. How\ncan it? It =\r\nis everywhere, omnipresent, equally present through all of us.\n\nThen the ot=\r\nher great source of misery is fear. Why does one man injure\nanother? Becaus=\r\ne he fears he will not have enough enjoyment. One man fears\nthat, perhaps, =\r\nhe will not have enough money, and that fear causes him to\ninjure others an=\r\nd rob them. How can there be fear if there is only one\nexistence? If a thun=\r\nderbolt falls on my head, it was I who was the\nthunderbolt, because I am th=\r\ne only existence. If a plague comes, it is I; if\na tiger comes, it is I. If=\r\n death comes, it is I. I am both death and life. We\nsee that fear comes wit=\r\nh the idea that there are two in the universe.\n\nWe have always heard it pre=\r\nached, &quot;Love one another&quot;. What for? That\ndoctrine was preached, but the ex=\r\nplanation is here. Why should I love every\none? Because they and I are one.=\r\n Why should I love my brother? Because he\nand I are one. There is this onen=\r\ness; this solidarity of the whole universe.\nFrom the lowest worm that crawl=\r\ns under our feet to the highest beings that\never lived =97 all have various=\r\n bodies, but are the one Soul. Through all\nmouths, you eat; through all han=\r\nds, you work; through all eyes, you see. You\nenjoy health in millions of bo=\r\ndies, you are suffering from disease in\nmillions of bodies. When this idea =\r\ncomes, and we realise it, see it, feel\nit, then will misery cease, and fear=\r\n with it. How can I die? There is\nnothing beyond me. Fear ceases, and then =\r\nalone comes perfect happiness and\nperfect love.\n\nThat universal sympathy, u=\r\nniversal love, universal bliss, that never\nchanges, raises man above everyt=\r\nhing. It has no reactions and no misery can\ntouch it; but this little eatin=\r\ng and drinking of the world always brings a\nreaction. The whole cause of it=\r\n is this dualism, the idea that I am separate\nfrom the universe, separate f=\r\nrom God. But as soon as we have realised that\n&quot;I am He, I am the Self of th=\r\ne universe, I am eternally blessed, eternally\nfree&quot; =97 then will come real=\r\n love, fear will vanish, and all misery cease.\n\nSource:\nhttp://en.wikisourc=\r\ne.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_2/Practical_Vedan=\r\nta_and_other_lectures/The_Way_to_Blessedness\n\n-- \nOm Namo Bhagavate Sri Ram=\r\nanaya\nPrasanth Jalasutram\n\nLove And Love Alone\n\r\n--00148531b766cde2050471ca50c8\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:Verdana;color:rgb(51, 51, 51)&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Volume 2, Practical Vedanta and=\r\n other lectures=A0&lt;br&gt;THE WAY TO BLESSEDNESS&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is this Sel=\r\nf?
