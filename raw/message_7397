At the end of chanting th=\r\ne manual does not mention &quot;om gam ganapataye namah vaushat&quot;. so again the c=\r\nonfusion should I put vaushat after chanting AH three times at the end. \n\n\n=\r\n2)While invoking Surya deva do I need to do Parivaara Devata Aahutis (offer=\r\nings to associates).\n\n3) While reading aditya Hrudayam should I put swahaa =\r\nafter Ithi Aditya Hrudyam mantrasya. \n\n4) My mother has a tamil book where =\r\naditya hrudyam has 34 verses. I have one with 31 only. How many verses does=\r\n AH consist of?\n\nI humbly request your help once again.\n\nThanks and regards=\r\n,\nPriya\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n"}}
