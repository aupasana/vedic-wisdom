Just develop a intense longing love for one for=\r\nm and feel the pangs of longing, develop the intensity so that the longing =\r\nconsume you.  the name will repeat itself easily u wont have to worry. Forg=\r\net the counts god can count. \n\nDo a homam, 15 min a day, that a open heart =\r\nsurgery. the panchopachr puja of offering 5 elements (isnt that tantra) is =\r\nas powerful as biggest tantra sadhana if done with full love/surrender.\n\nYo=\r\nur link of ramkrishan about surrendering all emotions was bang on target. n=\r\not because it was a great article in itself but because you are doing it.\n\n=\r\nIntellectualize becomes a hurdle which heart is not able to cross. \n\nYou sa=\r\nid you got diksha for a mantra from a monk in shivananda tradition. do you =\r\nknow what that means - Thats like warren buffet giving you an addon debit c=\r\nard to his bank balance.\n\nand as for puruscharan/count and activating a man=\r\ntra many people are able to activate at 1/10 counts, many not able to at ev=\r\nen 10x counts, and many are able to activate seemingly wrong words &quot;hat par=\r\na (get lost)&quot; as their mantra.  ????\n\nthanks for letting me answer &quot;myself&quot;=\r\n\n\n\nBhairavi, &quot;Whoever does sadhana with whatever intention, they will achie=\r\nve that.&quot;\n\nregards,\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;sunrise_1080&quot; =\r\n&lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; This business of repeating God Name, that Nob=\r\nody ji mentioned...it ain&#39;t no joke ...doing it I mean! I tried today, and =\r\nboy, it was hard...failed mostly, to be honest.\n&gt; \n&gt; But every sage Ramakri=\r\nshna, Anandamayi Ma, Ammachi, Sivananda, Chaitanya, Mira, Rabia, Papa Ramda=\r\ns, every one of them was obsessed with this Name business. That means, ther=\r\ne must be something to it.\n\n&gt; I really want to take up Nobody ji&#39;s suggesti=\r\non and get obsessed with the Name. I firmly believe in it. I got sick (real=\r\n sick) a few times, and the Name helped me (have had 2-3 black outs when I =\r\nwas unwell, long story, but basically, I was conscious during these black o=\r\nuts, and it felt like I was dying...and it sounds odd, but there were no th=\r\noughts except the Name &quot;Keshava please help me&quot; or &quot;Narayana&quot;). These episo=\r\ndes scared the bejesus out of me, and each time I came out of them, I felt =\r\n&quot;I MUST DO MORE JAPA&quot; it&#39;s the only thing that&#39;ll save me. All else is of n=\r\no use when I&#39;m in deep sh*t (pardon my language), the Name alone is reliabl=\r\ne.\n&gt; \n&gt; What I&#39;m trying to say, is I want to devise some practical ways to =\r\nget serious about this sadhana. \n\n&gt; \n&gt; Sivananda Saraswati (Rishikesh) was =\r\na big fan of japa, and especially of Purascharana (repeating mantra as many=\r\n lakhs as there are syllables in the mantra. Eg Gayatri has 24 syllables, s=\r\no one Purascharana is 24 lakh repetitions). He went on to say that 14 crore=\r\n of japa with feeling would result in Darshan of God in physical form, face=\r\n to face. That would be great! Really wanted to do it...but when I did the =\r\nmaths, I worked out that, at the rate of 12 hours japa a day, every single =\r\nday from now on, it would take me till age 83 to finish this. :( \n&gt; \n&gt; But =\r\nhey, I decided to make a start anyway, and began my my first Purascharana o=\r\nf the Om Namo Narayanaya mantra, in January this year, I am doing a measley=\r\n 11 rounds a day, with my mind wandering most of the time (hard core people=\r\n do hundreds of rounds with proper concentration daily). I&#39;m a slow chanter=\r\n, and need to say the mantra loudly or in a barely audible whisper. My ment=\r\nal chanting is gradually improving but very difficult to do for more than 1=\r\n-2 minutes. It&#39;s gonna take me till October 2013 to finish the 8 lakhs. The=\r\nn my plan is to take a 3 month break (and do 7 rounds a day), and then star=\r\nt another Purascharana. \n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, two things help me get my 11 rounds o=\r\nf japa done every day when I&#39;m at work/outdoors. Thought I&#39;d mention it, if=\r\n anybody&#39;s interested, just in case it&#39;s helpful. \n&gt; \n&gt; One is Telephone Ja=\r\npa. I hold my mobile to my ear, and pretend I&#39;m on the phone. While doing t=\r\nhis, I stick my hand in my pocket and count the japa on my fingers. I get a=\r\n couple of rounds done during my working day this way (I check carefully to=\r\n make sure nobody&#39;s listening). Also while stuck in traffic (while the car =\r\nis NOT moving), I put my hands-free ear pieces on, and pretend I&#39;m chatting=\r\n to a friend on the phone and do a couple of rounds. \n&gt; \n&gt; The other thing =\r\nthat I find useful (now please excuse the phrase), is &quot;Toilet japa&quot;. When I=\r\n need to escape to do a round or two of japa at work, I excuse myself for a=\r\n few minutes and lock myself up in a toilet cubicle. I then very very quiet=\r\nly mutter the mantra to myself for 5-10 minutes (lips moving, no sound audi=\r\nble, in case anybody hears). I do about 2 sessions of this a day. This allo=\r\nws me to complete my 11 rounds a day, on days when my working hours are lon=\r\ng. \n&gt; \n&gt; I know this sounds bonkers, but I thought I&#39;d mention this for any=\r\none else whose work life interferes with their japa. At least, it provides =\r\na solution to doing a bit of japa at work.\n&gt; \n&gt; If anybody else has any tho=\r\nughts/suggestions, on how to repeat God&#39; Name constantly, kindly share. \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Best wishes, and Om Namo Narayanaya, \n&gt; \n&gt; Aparna\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
