In what quality one tool dif=\r\nfers form another?&quot;\n\n1.The one primary difference between both systems is t=\r\nhis. God pervades both the pure and impure in the world. To quote vimalanan=\r\nda from the third book of karma &quot; He can seen both in the butcher and the g=\r\noat that is being butchered &quot; . It takes somebody of the level of Vimalanan=\r\nda to make no distinction between the butcher and the butchered or an Yogi =\r\nof the Calibre of Trailinga swami who worshipped Kashi vishweshwara with hu=\r\nman waste to prove that god pervades everything.\n\nIn the traditional Vedic =\r\nform of worship we use only the best pure sattvic substances to worship god=\r\n.Also we specifically worship only the positive gentle qualities of god. It=\r\n is a slow step by step process for one&#39;s inner growth.\n\n2.The Tantric form=\r\n of worship is the cry of the beloved unable to bear the separation from on=\r\ne&#39;s Istha. The worshipper dares to take the best shortcut available. Tantra=\r\n does not just worship the gentle forms of god ,it adores even the most vio=\r\nlent form of god. To give an example the food grains that we all eat are ob=\r\ntained after considerable violence inflicted on mother earth and the millio=\r\nns of organisms present in the soil . Death is what gives rise to life and =\r\nnot the other way around. Tantra gives an form to all the qualities of god =\r\nand uses every substance possible to achieve these goals.\n\nIt is the intens=\r\ne love for god which motivates this love driven craziness for an Aghori or =\r\ntantric to worship the fierce form of the mother so that she can strip away=\r\n all mental conditioning in a couple of lifetimes itself. A tantric will tu=\r\nrn every activity of his into playful worship of the divine . It could be s=\r\nomething as extreme as shava sadhana or something as mundane as eating one&#39;=\r\ns meal.\n\nThe path has many dangers for one is attempting to quickly cut thr=\r\nough one&#39;s karmas and conditioning and that is why emphasis is laid on a li=\r\nving guru to guide one in the path.Also when the deity comes to play the te=\r\nsts can be quite severe .\n\n\nOne is a long winded safe path to eternal bliss=\r\n  .The other is a shortcut to eternal bliss passing through momentary hell.=\r\n :) Which path one chooses is dependent on how much one yearns for the divi=\r\nne.\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;=\r\npriyank_priyank&quot; &lt;aks_day@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Kishore ji, \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for link=\r\n. \n&gt; \n&gt; I shoudl have framed my que in better way.\n&gt; \n&gt; - How is vedic wors=\r\nhip different from tantra worship of same diety.

Just wanted to share one input on this question\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &quot;- Since khadagmala comes under tantra, does it mean we are praying t=\r\no tamasic\n&gt; &gt; form of devi (equivalent of chandi)?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Khadgamala sto=\r\ntra is definetly not worshipping the tamasic form of the mother and also in=\r\n reality there is no tamasic form of the mother !!!!! It is a powerful tool=\r\n and if you notice the stotra you will find worship being done at the Nine =\r\nenclosures of the sri chakra and the forms of the goddess at each enclosure=\r\n and triangle.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is a misconception to think traditional worship =\r\ndone in temples is the sattvic form and tantric worship is worship of the t=\r\namasic form. Both are one and the same ,just materials having been substitu=\r\nted.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you wish to read this is an nice document on the Khadgamal=\r\na stotra from Devipuram . They do a really good job of dispelling some of t=\r\nhe myths around devi worship and also have thrown open the doors of devi wo=\r\nrship to one and all.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One is an audio link with Amritananda Natha =\r\nSaraswati himself chanting it.His voice is mesmerizing and soothing.The oth=\r\ner is the stotra with meanings of each round of the stotra.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http:/=\r\n/old.devipuram.com/downloads/khadgamala_stotram.html\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; www.shaktisad=\r\nhana.org/images/Khadgamala/KSFINAL.doc\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt; Vemparla R=\r\nam Kishore\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;priyank_priyank&quot; =\r\n&lt;aks_day@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Many t=\r\nhanks for making it all clear, its very fine, but extremely important. summ=\r\narizing for myself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1.

Then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is ok to dig in severa=\r\nl places to become familiar with digging.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though one may s=\r\npecialize in one subject in higher studies, one learns \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many subjec=\r\nts at a young age. But, eventually you have to focus on one \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; subjec=\r\nt. Similarly, worshipping several deities with several mantras is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nok in the beginning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My thumb rule is this: Leave all mant=\r\nras and stick to one, if you feel \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comfortable with it. If you feel=\r\n guilty and uncomfortable, then you are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; probably not ready yet and=\r\n so keep doing your entire routine. But start \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; focusing on one mant=\r\nra and do more of it, i.e. do others for a small \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; duration and spen=\r\nd most doing one mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We do not have perfect enough kno=\r\nwledge of astrology to rely on it.

But lagna lord Mercury is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; super-strong =\r\nand shows Vishnu. Saturn shows ascetic and Sun shows Rama. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, Sun=\r\n-Saturn-Mercury combination to me shows Rama in an ascetic form \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; du=\r\nring vanavas. Worship Rama. Develop the HanumadBhava (think and act \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; like Hanuman) and worship Rama.
