Rao&quot; &lt;pvr108@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; =A0=\r\n\n&gt; Some people are confused with the &quot;sh&quot; sound as in &quot;shiva&quot; or &quot;shrI rAma=\r\n&quot; or &quot;shava&quot;. I want to clarify it.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; There are three s-sounds in San=\r\nskrita - sha, Sha and sa (using iTrans notation). They appear in alphabet i=\r\nn that order. The middle one is written in Devanagari script like &quot;pa&quot; with=\r\n a cross line through it. The first letter &quot;sha&quot; (as in shiva) is pronounce=\r\nd by some as &quot;Sha&quot; and by some as &quot;sa&quot; and both are incorrect.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Firs=\r\nt some background..\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Consider the five Sanskrit letters &quot;ka&quot; (k as i=\r\nn in kavi - poet), &quot;cha&quot; (ch as in chaNDI or church), &quot;Ta&quot; (T as in Tom or =\r\nTapori), &quot;ta&quot; (t as in tantra) and &quot;pa&quot; (p as an pass). Pronounce them in q=\r\nuick succession a few times - &quot;ka cha Ta ta pa&quot;. Note the point where tongu=\r\ne touches the upper palate/surface of mouth when you say these. For &quot;ka&quot;, i=\r\nt will be way back in mouth, near the throat. For &quot;cha&quot;, it will move towar=\r\nds the front, but still in the back. For &quot;Ta&quot;, it will move further towards=\r\n the front and tongue will touch a little above teeth. For &quot;ta&quot;, tongue wil=\r\nl touch teeth. For &quot;pa&quot;, tongue will not touch anything, but lips will touc=\r\nh each other.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Say &quot;ka cha Ta ta pa&quot; several times and notice the pr=\r\nogression from the back of mouth to lips. Get a feel for the position of &quot;c=\r\nha Ta ta&quot;. Say &quot;cha Ta ta&quot; several times.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Now, the pronunciation of=\r\n &quot;sha Sha sa&quot; (sh as in shiva, shrI etc, Sh as in uShA, veSha etc, s as in =\r\nsatya, sama) is very similar to that of &quot;cha Ta ta&quot;. In the latter 3 sounds=\r\n, tongue touches the upper palate of mouth at 3 places (for which you just =\r\ngot a feel). In the former 3 sounds, tongue comes close to touching in the =\r\nsame 3 places, but does not actually touch. It comes close to touching and =\r\nthere is some gap.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; With this understanding, now practice saying &quot;ch=\r\na sha&quot; several times, &quot;Ta Sha&quot; several times and &quot;ta sa&quot; several times. You=\r\n will see that each pair is pronounced at the same place. If tongue touches=\r\n mouth&#39;s upper palate at one position for the first sound and comes close t=\r\no touching at a *different* position for the second sound in the same pair,=\r\n you are making a mistake. Try again.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; No wonder that visarga become=\r\ns sh, Sh and s if ch, T and t (respectively) come after it, as per sandhi r=\r\nules of grammar. Sanskrit grammar is very logical and based on phonology (s=\r\ntudy of sounds).\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrology &=\r\n Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; --------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
