It is \n&gt; very inspiring and can inspire others too to overcome weaknesse=\r\ns. \n&gt; Overcoming external weaknesses such as drinking, smoking, drugs etc a=\r\nnd \n&gt; internal weaknesses such as lust, anger, jealosy etc, is the true sig=\r\nn \n&gt; of one&#39;s progress with a sadhana. You are definitely on the right path=\r\n \n&gt; and keep going!\n&gt; \n&gt; As Vimalananda says, nature conspires to help one =\r\nwho truly wants to \n&gt; learn and do a sadhana!\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n As some people have already pointed out, one&#39;s varna is decided by one&#39;s \n=\r\n&gt; aptitude and attitude. Valmiki must&#39;ve been a great brahmin in previous \n=\r\n&gt; lives, but some karmas made him take birth as a shoodra and eventually \n&gt;=\r\n his original samskaras took over and he became a brahmin, a rishi and a \n&gt;=\r\n maharshi. He even taught brahma jnana to Bharadwaja, one of the \n&gt; saptars=\r\nhis!\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, if one is drawn to fire, does homam over a period of t=\r\nime and \n&gt; overcomes some weaknesses, obviously strong samskaras are presen=\r\nt from \n&gt; previous lives. If they are allowed to dominate, one will make pr=\r\nogress. \n&gt; One becomes a true brahmana with sadhana. As one realizes true k=\r\nnowledge \n&gt; internally, one may even become worthy of teaching spiritual kn=\r\nowledge \n&gt; to others, including brahmanas by birth!\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        =\r\n*\n&gt; \n&gt; Not only non-brahmins from India, but people not born in India/Hindu=\r\nism \n&gt; are doing homam regularly. Some of them are (will be) making great \n=\r\n&gt; progess too. As a result, a strong Brahmin (true!) class will be \n&gt; estab=\r\nlished across the world and that will increase dharma on earth.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just y=\r\nesterday night, one Russian origin CS professor from Canada who \n&gt; was in B=\r\noston as a visiting scholar at MIT came to my house and learned \n&gt; homam. H=\r\ne did Ganapathi homam at my house with my help and plans to do \n&gt; it in Can=\r\nada. He has Jupiter in Pisces in 12th house and I got a nice \n&gt; feeling whe=\r\nn he was doing homam. There were also several good omens, \n&gt; making me thin=\r\nk he is relatively well-prepared for sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; A dirty golden vessel is=\r\n more valuable than a brightly shining copper \n&gt; vessel that is gold-plated=\r\n! You just need to clean the former..\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; This ho=\r\nmam movement is in nascent stages yet. Once a critical mass of \n&gt; sadhakas =\r\naccumulates and people start making progress, it will spread \n&gt; like a wild=\r\nfire. There is no hurry and there is need to feel pressure, \n&gt; for these th=\r\nings happen due to the will of higher beings. We are all \n&gt; merely instrume=\r\nnts.\n&gt; \n&gt; I tend to think that there are blessings of some great saints/yog=\r\nis \n&gt; behind this. When we did Shata Chandi homam at Chennai in March 2006,=\r\n we \n&gt; casually selected a muhurta for the sankalpa of the week-long ritual=\r\n, so \n&gt; that maha-poornahuti happens on an Ashtami day. It was during this =\r\nweek \n&gt; that Manish received a command from the divine Mother to spread hom=\r\nam. \n&gt; When I and Manish took the sankalpa at the temple on the first day, =\r\nit \n&gt; was Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s lunar birthday and it was within 5 min =\r\n\n&gt; from the exact time when the angle between Sun and Moon matched that at =\r\n\n&gt; his birth. When I started daily homam about 5-6 months later, as a \n&gt; pr=\r\necursor to publishing the manuals a few months later, there was \n&gt; another =\r\ncoincidence. It was exactly 120 lunar years since Ramakrishna \n&gt; left his p=\r\nhysical body. Moreover, I had a vision of Ramakrishna \n&gt; Paramahamsa a day =\r\nbefore Manish had the vision of divine Mother, during \n&gt; that week of Shata=\r\n Chandi at the Kali temple in Chennai. I am not \n&gt; attached to forms and I =\r\nrarely get visions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Several months before that, in late 2005, I had an=\r\n interesting dream \n&gt; that actually felt real (i.e. not like a dream). In t=\r\nhe dream, there was \n&gt; a strong and pleasant naad (buzz) that used to accom=\r\npany my Kundalini \n&gt; rises through sushumna during those days. It was dark =\r\nand there was a \n&gt; huge fire. I was sitting in front of the fire. A person =\r\nwith a powerful \n&gt; persona, whom I had never seen before, sat in front of m=\r\ne. He was \n&gt; teaching me some yoga involving fire and what yoga means etc. =\r\nHe taught \n&gt; several things in Sanskrit. Suddenly he changed into Manish. T=\r\nhen shakti \n&gt; came down, naad stopped, &quot;dream&quot; ended, and I was aware of my=\r\n body lying \n&gt; on bed. The face of the person I saw was vivid in my mind. I=\r\n did not \n&gt; know who it was. I mentioned this dream to Manish a week or two=\r\n later. \n&gt; He said he did not know who it was, but asked me a week later to=\r\n check \n&gt; out the photo of a specific yogi. When I did a search on the inte=\r\nrnet, I \n&gt; found a photo (apparently the only photo available of that yogi)=\r\n. It \n&gt; looked very close to what I saw in my dream, except that the person=\r\n in \n&gt; my dream seemed like a slightly younger version of that photo. This =\r\nwas \n&gt; a famous yogi from the parampara of Mahavatar Babaji. As I had never=\r\n \n&gt; seen his photo before that or read much about that lineage or their \n&gt; =\r\nteachings, his coming in my dream was strange. Also, teaching me some \n&gt; yo=\r\nga involving fire was strange, because homam movement did not start \n&gt; then=\r\n and I was not thinking of fire or fire ritual at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are some =\r\nsigns like this, which make me think that we are being \n&gt; used as instrumen=\r\nts in a big &quot;project&quot; designed by some great yogis in \n&gt; higher realms. It =\r\nseems to me like this project has an important purpose \n&gt; and will help MAN=\r\nY people in their quest for god, in the coming decades \n&gt; and centuries.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, J=\r\nyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitr=\r\ni Tarpana:\n&gt;                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       Film=\r\ns that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spirituality: h=\r\nttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: http://gro=\r\nups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;                       Twitter ID: @ho=\r\nmam108\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, Jul 21, 2011 at 4:42 AM, srinivas wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;     Hi:\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; I am a non Brahmin, fortunately I came across Homam manuals/videos in \n&gt; =\r\ninternet.
