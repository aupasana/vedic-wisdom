But I consciously chose to record it with a shirt \non, in order to not se=\r\nnd a wrong message to those living in cold \nclimates and having to do homam=\r\n in cold garages. Instead of sticking \nto unnecessarily strict rules and en=\r\nding up not doing homam as \noften, I want people to relax rules that do not=\r\n matter and do it as \noften as they can. I want to de-emphasize things that=\r\n do not matter \nthat much.\n&gt;  \n&gt; World is going to go through interesting t=\r\nimes and we need many \nserious sadhakas - those who may be wearing many clo=\r\nthes on the body \nbut shed off as many layers as possible on their ego - do=\r\ning homam \non a regular basis.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I use more materials in my daily Chand=\r\ni homam (because I use a \nbigger homa kundam for it) than I used in the vid=\r\neo, but again that \nwas a conscious choice. I did not want something elabor=\r\nate. I wanted \nto demonstrate how a very simple homam can be performed quit=\r\ne easily \nwith very few materials and a simple setup. Even a very simple \np=\r\nrocedure like this will make a big difference in the world, if a \nlot of pe=\r\nople are doing this sincerely everyday.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Sh=\r\nort Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpana=\r\ns Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://ved=\r\nicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJaganna=\r\nth.org\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Radhakrishnan Jambunatha \n=\r\n&gt;   To: sivacharya@yahoogroups.com ; Narasimha P.V.R. \n&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, F=\r\nebruary 03, 2009 10:17 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [sivacharya] Fw: Maha Ganapathi =\r\nHomam Video (based \non the manual)\n&gt; \n&gt;         Dear Sri Narasimha,\n&gt; \n&gt;   =\r\n      r u living in a foreign country.
