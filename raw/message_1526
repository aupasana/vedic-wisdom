My mother is of the view that homam should not be=\r\n performed at home and she also says that I should not also participate in =\r\nany homam (taking sankalpam), while family priest is of the opinion that he=\r\n will do the homam for me in a temple premises. \n\nI would be thankful to ha=\r\nve your advice on the subject.\n\n2. I am doing Yajur Vedhi &#39;Brahma Yagnam&#39; (=\r\nBothayana Sutram, which I belong to) every day, which is offer of tarpana t=\r\no Deva, Rishi&#39;s and Pitru. Is this the same thing you mention as Pitri Tarp=\r\nana in Tarpana manual? Please advise. \n\nThanks and Regards,\nShankar \n\n\n"}}
