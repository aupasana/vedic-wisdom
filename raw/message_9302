You mean the world of Rajarshi? ;-)&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;True. But that is why I used a bit of the future continuous tense in=\r\n my hopeful assertion:) I don&#39;t think the world at large will let go of the=\r\n Dasavatara idea anytime soon, however the evolutionary link will keep gain=\r\ning more ground. Already many seem to think that way. I was watching a TV p=\r\nrogram of a\n&gt;  god-man\n&gt;  speaking to massive gathering of his followers in=\r\n an Indian city and he was actually explaining dasavatara with evolution.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Though this thought came to me independently, I am definitely not the=\r\n first one, or\n&gt;  hopefully the last one, who finds an evolutionary link in=\r\n the story of the Dasavataras. Apparently, it was Sri Aurobindo who first w=\r\nrote about this.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;&lt;=\r\nTo give a simplisitc analogy, some jewllery may be gold mixed with some \n&gt; =\r\namount of copper. If one jewllery is 100% pure gold, it does not mean it\n&gt; =\r\n contains all the gold in the\n&gt;  world. It only means it has nothing other =\r\nthan gold. Similarly, the \n&gt; four poornavataras mentioned by Parasara are 1=\r\n00% divine and do not \n&gt; contain jivamsa. It does not mean they contain &quot;al=\r\nl the divinity&quot; in \n&gt; cosmos.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Very beautiful analogy! Makes sense.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;&lt; If no form is &quot;equal to&quot; supreme being and every form is=\r\n a &quot;subset&quot; of \n&gt; supreme being (like a cloud in sky), what is the meaning =\r\nof &quot;swayam \n&gt; bhagavan&quot;???&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Hmm.. the way *I look at it*, the Supre=\r\nme Being is truly Infinite in every sense, yet when it makes a descent into=\r\n our plane of material life, it assumes a form, a personality and a=C2=A0 c=\r\nharacter. Now based on the need of THAT desh-kaal, it chooses its specific =\r\npersonality and form, which, to the average consciousness of that period se=\r\nems like a fantastic achievement, pushing the limits of imagination to the =\r\nextreme, for that period. And in this light, Krshna is Swayam Bhagawan. As =\r\nif, if G-d were to come down in flesh and blood in fantastic potency for th=\r\ne age that we are living in - it must have been Krshna with his effortless =\r\nand matchless display of the multiple skills, including such extreme Divine=\r\n feats as showing his foster mother the whole universe contained inside his=\r\n mouth, or making Rishi Markandeya experience the effects of Yogamaya when =\r\nhe saw this great deluge that ended the world and in the middle of those tu=\r\nrbulent waters, a Divine Child\n&gt;  was floating in a Banyana-leaf, sucking h=\r\nis own right toe. When the Child sucked Rishi Markandeya inside him through=\r\n his breath, the Rishi perceived infinite number of universes and planetary=\r\n systems within the body of the Child. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Recently I was reading a Tan=\r\ntric scripture. Tara Rahashyam. Among ShaktAs, it is a revered scripture. I=\r\n found something interesting. While naturally this being a ShaktA text, the=\r\n Divine Mother in Her various forms are eulogized as Supreme, it also menti=\r\nons that in Kali, Krshna is Supreme. This explains why only Krshna among th=\r\ne various avatars of Vishnu is worshiped in those parts of India where Tant=\r\nras were the predominant scriptures that were followed. Rama is considered =\r\nas a part of Krshna. So along with Krshna nama, Rama nama japa is also done=\r\n, though there is no exclusive mass worship of Rama in these parts. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;India has so many\n&gt;  flavors, that it is almost mind boggling.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n*=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;On many subtle points, your mail was very th=\r\nought provoking. And I am sure I will keep pondering over various hints for=\r\n quite some time. But one point I want to make about Vedanta. I agree total=\r\nly with you. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Vedanta is the philosophy, not only of Shankara Adwait=\r\nha, but also that of Ramanujacharya, Madhavacharya, Chaitanya, Vallavachary=\r\na as well as the TantrAs. They are all Vedantas.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Quite simple put, t=\r\nhere are two fundamental states of pure consciousness. Static, and dynamic.=\r\n Purusha and Shakti. The static consciousness is same all around in everyth=\r\ning, from the highest Avatara to the lowest stone. But the dynamic aspect o=\r\nf consciousness is NOT same in everything.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Ramakrishna used to say, =\r\nKali in present in everyone, but Her Shakti is not same in everyone! This c=\r\nrucial point lies in the heart of Tantric Vedanta philosophy. By the proces=\r\ns of sadhana,\n&gt;  this dynamic aspect of consciousness can be enhanced in an=\r\n individual. This is the eternal purification of individual Chit-Shakti. Th=\r\ne purer it is, the stronger it becomes. This also accommodates for the idea=\r\n of vigyana. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;That is why however much sadhana a person may do, he/s=\r\nhe will never ever attain to the level of a Rama or a Krshna. Its practical=\r\nly impossible. The difference is in their levels of individualized chit-sha=\r\nkti. Or that of a Rishi. Their Chit-Shakit is so powerful, so pure, so free=\r\n, that it can identify with the Universe and do things which are impossible=\r\n to imagine. Which we cannot. Ever.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Once again, wishing everyone=\r\n a fruitful and auspicious Akshaya Tritiya!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;-Regards\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0Rajars=\r\nhi\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;________=\r\n________________________\n&gt; &gt; From: Narasimha P.V.R.

It means a c=\r\nompletely divine avatara with no jivamsa. There can be more than one poorna=\r\nvataras. They are not necessarily &quot;equal&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;To give a simplisit=\r\nc analogy, some jewllery may be gold mixed with some amount of\n&gt;  copper. I=\r\nf one jewllery is 100% pure gold, it\n&gt;  does not mean\n&gt;  it contains all th=\r\ne gold in the\n&gt;  world. It only means it has nothing other than gold. Simil=\r\narly, the four poornavataras mentioned by Parasara are 100% divine and do n=\r\not contain jivamsa. It does not mean they contain &quot;all the divinity&quot; in cos=\r\nmos.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;In fact, the very notion that=\r\n any one form can be &quot;the most complete or perfect avatara&quot; or &quot;one that pe=\r\nrsonifies entire divinity of Supreme Being&quot; or &quot;one equal to Supreme Being&quot;=\r\n is unacceptable and inconsistent with SB 1.3.30-31, which says that ANY fo=\r\nrm of Supreme Being is like a cloud in the sky, while Supreme Being is like=\r\n the sky containing all possible clouds.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;Supreme Being is endo=\r\nwed with infinite qualities. Any form contains a finite number of those qua=\r\nlities. So no form can be &quot;equal to&quot; Supreme Being. SB 1.3.30-31 is clear i=\r\nn that regard.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;If one\n&gt;  form is &quot;equal to&quot; supreme being and =\r\nothers are\n&gt;  not, you can conclude that that form is &quot;the best&quot;. If neithe=\r\nr form is &quot;equal to&quot; supreme being, how can you really compare the differen=\r\nt qualities of two forms?\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;Anyway=\r\n, this renders your (3) a meaningless issue. Whether that line refers to Kr=\r\nishna alone or not is irrelevant, for, in either case, &quot;swayam bhagavan&quot; ca=\r\nnnot mean &quot;a personification of the entirety of supreme being&quot;. Before you =\r\nwonder whether it refers to Krishna alone or not, first figure out what &quot;sw=\r\nayam bhagavan&quot; actually means, in a way that is not inconsistent with verse=\r\ns that follow! If no form is &quot;equal to&quot; supreme being and every form is a &quot;=\r\nsubset&quot; of supreme being (like a cloud in sky), what is the meaning of &quot;swa=\r\nyam bhagavan&quot;???\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n  *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;Regarding (4),=\r\n Parasara\n&gt;  identified 4 avataras as 100% divine, with no jivamsa, and ide=\r\nntified the source of divinity in each of them. He only gave objective info=\r\nrmation and did not give any subjective judgment on who is the best, which =\r\nSuta apparently did.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;I have not read BV Purana. If you can quo=\r\nte some verses before and after, I can comment. Any comparison between avat=\r\naras WILL have to be under some subjective context. I don&#39;t know the contex=\r\nt of Suta&#39;s statement you allude to.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;Though any comparison is =\r\nsubjective, I will be surprised if someone considers the other two poornava=\r\ntaras of Vishnu as the &quot;best&quot; avataras. But, I will not be surprised if dif=\r\nferent people consider Rama and Krishna as the most perfect avataras. Sun a=\r\nnd Moon are the luminaries and show soul and mind, which clearly have a pri=\r\nmary significance compared to other aspects of consciousness! So Rama and K=\r\nrishna are bound to be seen as the best by different people.\n&gt;  However, wh=\r\nat Suta\n&gt;  apparently said can only be a subjective view under some context=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;Regarding (2): Kala means a part=\r\n or a phase. Moon has 16 phases (representing 16 tithis, including Amavasya=\r\n and Pournima), but Sun has only one phase - he is always full and bright!\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;Just like Moon, mind has many moods, even a perfected one. A p=\r\nerfected mind goes through those moods with full awareness of underlying re=\r\nality, whereas an imperfect mind experiences them under delusion. But it is=\r\n the nature of Moon/mind to have variations. Sun/soul OTOH has no such vari=\r\nations.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;Krishna may show Vishwaroopa oneday, run away from bat=\r\ntlefield another day (e.g. Jarasandha), do amazing miracles oneday and play=\r\n clever tricks another day. There is a lot more variety to his personality =\r\nthan Rama&#39;s. Now, does that make him better or worse than Rama? Well, that\n=\r\n&gt;  is\n&gt;  a *subjective* matter.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;=\r\nRegarding (1): Parasara said that paramatmamsa is present in several beings=\r\n such a planets, Brahma, Shiva, their consorts, etc. Grahas sustain the wor=\r\nld appearance in consciousness by grasping it based on karmaphala. So they =\r\nstand for different qualities of Vishnu that sustain the world appearance. =\r\nSo Vishnu&#39;s avataras are associated with grahas. But Pararsara said that av=\r\nataras can descend from the paramatmamsa present in several other beings (e=\r\n.g. Shiva, Parvati, Ashwins, Maruts etc). Unfortunately, we have meagre und=\r\nerstanding what various deities stand for, what forces play a role in creat=\r\ning, sustaining and destroying the world appearance in consciousness. Peopl=\r\ne talk too much about Vedanta (end of Veda) and there is hardly any underst=\r\nanding of Veda. When it comes to Puranic stories, we think in terms of\n&gt;  s=\r\nuperficial stories and not in terms of how it maps to what happens in consc=\r\niousness.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;Mohini was an avatara of Vishnu + Maheshwari. Nara &=\r\n Narayana were incarnations of Narayana (i.e. Brahma + Vishnu + Shiva). I d=\r\non&#39;t know about Dhanvantari and will pass for today.

All of them are m=\r\nentioned as Avataras of the Supreme Being in SB.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;2. What is your o=\r\npinion about the general stated idea that only Krshna is 16 kala-poorna and=\r\n others are not?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;3. That the SB mentions Krshna as Swayam Bhagwan =\r\nONLY with respect to the previous sloka where it says that all rishis, muni=\r\ns etc are also Avataras, is one interpretation, and not too popular at that=\r\n. OTOH, most of the great commentators, and they were no less in their\n&gt;  s=\r\npiritual merit\n&gt;  or intellectual prowess have taken that specific verse to=\r\n mean Krshna to be greater than ALL Avataras. The verse itself does not men=\r\ntion that it is with respect to the previous verse, or with respect to all =\r\nthe 17 verses that precede it, which lists all Avataras. So it boils down t=\r\no interpretation based on individual conditioning. It seems Chaitanya Mahap=\r\nrabhu, Vallavacharya, Nimbarka, etc all shared a similar conditioning which=\r\n made them read that verse to mean that only Krshna is Swayam Bhagwan. Woul=\r\nd you agree to this conclusion? :) \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;4. Apparently in the Brahma Va=\r\nivarta Purana, Suta tells the Rishis of Naimisharanya that Krshna is greate=\r\nst Avatara of them all. So, how do we resolve this apparent conflict betwee=\r\nn what Rishi Parashara states and what this Purana states?

I am just doing a thinking aloud here. Feel free to disagree :)\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Firstly, I feel, the conception of colloquially used=C2=A0t=\r\nerm=C2=A0Bhagawan as a Superman with unlimited potentials way beyond what a=\r\nny normal human being can achieve, came into existence from the Vaishnava s=\r\nchools of Kali Yuga, who looked at Krshna as the ultimate God=C2=A0on earth=\r\n. It is difficult to miss the phonetic=C2=A0similarity between terms Bhagaw=\r\nata and Bhagawana. The Bhagawata religion started from the Gita and a conte=\r\nmplation of the life of Krshna. All the major purely=C2=A0Vaishnava Acharya=\r\ns - Ramanujacharya, Madhavacharya, Vallavacharya, Nimbarka, Sri Chaitanya=\r\n=C2=A0as well as the nava-naths (Dhaneshwari was the earliest known non-san=\r\nskrit translation of the Gita) - considered, (with differing nuances on the=\r\n=C2=A0relation between jiva, paramatma, moksha=C2=A0etc), Krshna as the ult=\r\nimate conception of God on earth. This was aided in no less a measure by th=\r\ne delcaration of the earliest Puranas, that is Vishnu Purana and the SB, th=\r\nat Krshna was a complete Avatara. Some,\n&gt;  like the Gaudiya Vaishnavas, wen=\r\nt one step ahead and took a very literal view of it all and declared Krshna=\r\n as the Ultimate Being, and the formless Paramatma, as well as Narayana,=C2=\r\n=A0as merely=C2=A0the aura of Krshna. Rama was also intricately linked to t=\r\nhis Krshnaa-ism, but was looked at as the earlier brith of Krshna, not as a=\r\n separate Divity in himself.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Whatever the case maybe, ea=\r\nch school had its own set of established saints and scholars to vouch for t=\r\nheir views. So it boiled down to interpretation, which is often, as you rig=\r\nhtly pointed out, based on=C2=A0various conditionings.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;W=\r\ne=C2=A0human beings are creatures of imagination. Whenever an Avatar appear=\r\ns on the earth,=C2=A0most of the great Mahatmas who appear after the Avatar=\r\na, remain=C2=A0overawed by the=C2=A0character of the last Avatara=C2=A0beca=\r\nuse invariable in the context of the desh-kaal-patra of those times, the li=\r\nfe of the Avatara shows actions performed which are=C2=A0way beyond=C2=A0im=\r\nagination for *those times*. Such a situation continues until the next Avat=\r\nara comes on earth. I am sure in the period after Rama, and before Krshna, =\r\nof which we have very little written record, the world at large remained en=\r\ntirely overawed by Rama Avatara.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In this light Krshna is=\r\n the Poorna-Avatara. When Kalki will appear on earth, he will be invarible =\r\naccompanied by a set of powerful Rishis - every Avatara comes with his cote=\r\nrie of Rishis who explain the philosophy and spirituality of the Avatara to=\r\n the general masses - who will then create new scriptures and Kalki will be=\r\n looked at as the crest jewel=C2=A0of the Avataras.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=\r\n=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I believe in the evolutionary parabl=\r\ne of these 9 Avatara because I find no other reason why these set of Avatar=\r\na, from the whole list of possible=C2=A0Avataras, have captured the popular=\r\n imagination. I mean Dattatreya is an Avatara too as per SB. His spirituali=\r\nty is no less than that of any other Avatara. Yet, he is not in the list of=\r\n 9/10 Avataras. \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The=C2=A0original Nath Yogis used to co=\r\nnsider=C2=A0Nine Chakras in the Human Body.

Each graha could very we=\r\nll=C2=A0represent the essential nature of each chakra. All these make me mo=\r\nre sanguine that there must be Nine Evolutionary Avataras, not ten. In whic=\r\nh case Kalki must be the Ninth Avatara.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Buddha, as you r=\r\nightly pointed out,=C2=A0has a tremendous logical appeal in Kali Yuga. But =\r\nif logic is the criteria, then why not Adi Shankara?

W=\r\nhat mainstream=C2=A0Hinduism today is, could not have been, had it not been=\r\n for the invaluable contribution of Adi Shankara. And if Buddha was truly=\r\n=C2=A0the awaited=C2=A09th Avatara of Vishnu, Shankara would not have been =\r\nable to absorb the philosophy of Buddha into Hinduism and thus make it lose=\r\n its grip on India. Buddhism\n&gt;  barely exists in land of its birth.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;All this taken together, make me more and more convinced that =\r\nthere are 9 evolutionary Avataras and the 9th is yet to come.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0 *=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A little bit about Rama and Krsh=\r\nna. When I said I admire Rama, it is not a lip-service. There are incidents=\r\n in the Ramayana which I find extremely inspiring, educative and uplifting.=\r\n Like the incident where Rama was to cross the ocean. Rama knew very well t=\r\nhat if he wanted, in one moment he could have used his Divine Astras and fo=\r\nrced the ocean to yield way to his army. Yet he sat in silent supplication =\r\nfor days, praying that the ocean allow his army safe passage. When all else=\r\n failed, when genuine goodwill was not recirpocated, and it was absolutely =\r\nnecessary to cross the ocean,=C2=A0THEN=C2=A0Rama took up weapons to get th=\r\ne job done.=C2=A0A powerful warrior,=C2=A0who knows=C2=A0very well how=C2=\r\n=A0powerful he=C2=A0himself is, not letting that sense of power pervert his=\r\n mind even for a moment is an amazing phenomenon. This kind of self-control=\r\n is rare and worthy of comtemplation, specially by anyone who feels, ever s=\r\no slightly, that he/she has some form of power or influence in\n&gt;  this worl=\r\nd in any sphere.=C2=A0Rama had no malice for anyone. Not even Ravana, by th=\r\ne end of the war at least. He was the very personification of Satwa. In Sat=\r\nwa, conflict and malice and cunningness are impossible.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\nRecently, a friend of mine told me that he has learnt all his life that one=\r\n must listen to Krshna&#39;s advice, but only follow what Rama did, and not wha=\r\nt Krshna did. I disagree with this vehemently. If one reads entire Krshna&#39;s=\r\n life=C2=A0with an objective mind, Krshna of Vrndavana, Krshna of Mathura, =\r\nKrshna of Kurushetra, Krshna the Jagat Guru who speaks the Gita, one will f=\r\nind that what Krshna the Guru adviced in the Gita,=C2=A0Krshna the=C2=A0Div=\r\nine Worker=C2=A0himself followed it all through his life at every instance.=\r\n It is his=C2=A0perfect detachment under all circumstances of life, from ch=\r\nildhood=C2=A0to his death,=C2=A0that makes me wonder, was this a man or was=\r\n this a God? Can a man even do something like this? It is as if there is a =\r\npart of Krshna who is always separate from everything, and silently watches=\r\n the whole scene with a bemused smile. He had not a single personal stake i=\r\nn the Mahabharata. Rama at least had his wife abducted for him to start a w=\r\nar against\n&gt;  Ravana. But Krshna had zero=C2=A0personal stake in the Mahabh=\r\narata.=C2=A0After liberating his parents from Kamsa, very soon he went off =\r\nto meet the Pandavas. From out of nowhere he forced himself into the politi=\r\ncs of the Mahabharata, and precipitated a great war to cleanse the world of=\r\n burden. While Lakshmana devoutly followed Rama all along the Ramayana and =\r\nthey were like an inseparable pair, as=C2=A0Balarama in his next incarnatio=\r\nn=C2=A0he could=C2=A0hardly understand Krshna. There are so many occassions=\r\n where Balarama asks Krshna, what are they doing with all these kings, and=\r\n=C2=A0that they should=C2=A0return to their village in Vrndavana. Krshna me=\r\nrely smiles. He knows that not everyone will understand everything. But tha=\r\nt cannot stop him from following his dharma, with perfect detachement from =\r\neveyrthing of this plane. Neither false praises, nor wrong accusations by h=\r\nis close people can affect him one bit. And I am not even counting the mira=\r\ncles he perfromed as a Divine\n&gt;  Child. So I worship Krshna, because I have=\r\n not yet met or heard of read of=C2=A0a single sadhaka or saint or ordinary=\r\n man or mahatma=C2=A0who has displayed this kind of perfected detachment th=\r\nrough thick and thin, yet not withdrawing from the world or actively perfor=\r\nming a larger dharma.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I started appreciating Swami Vivek=\r\nanada more after I understood a bit of the Krshna Avatara. That was the las=\r\nt known saint who lived a whirlwind life in the middle of a circus-stopligh=\r\nt of fame and accusations, on one side adoring admirers and on the other bi=\r\ntter enemies accusing him of=C2=A0being a heretic=C2=A0right upto the=C2=A0=\r\nvery end of his brief life,=C2=A0and yet none of that affected him to any g=\r\nreat degree. He faced terrific racism in the America, yet not a single spee=\r\nch of his reflects the slightest trace of bitterness, anger, or negativity.=\r\n That is such a fantastic achievement, IMHO.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I agree wit=\r\nh you, Narasimha, for most of us it is better to=C2=A0try to=C2=A0mould one=\r\ns life=C2=A0with the same kind of supreme selflessness that Rama showed all=\r\n along.=C2=A0Not just worship Rama=C2=A0but more importantly study=C2=A0his=\r\n life and imbibe,=C2=A0to whatever degree possible, the quality he represen=\r\nted.=C2=A0Maybe, just maybe, then the Unmanifested Reality - Shiva - will f=\r\nix the mind so firmly on that Reality, that in some future life, in some la=\r\nter birth, one will be able to live life like Krshna showed, unattached and=\r\n unaffected by any dirt that the world throws up.

If invoked, it removes that attachment and takes one back to being est=\r\nablished in Self. So an avatara corresponding to Ketu occurred.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As collective consciousness became denser, being established in S=\r\nelf became less natural and more effort was needed. So the\n&gt;  &quot;spirit of pa=\r\ntience, persistence and\n&gt;  hard-work&quot; (Saturn) became relevant and an avata=\r\nra corresponding to Saturn occurred. And so on.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In the d=\r\nark ages of Kali yuga, rational minds wouldn&#39;t accept anything that didn&#39;t =\r\n&quot;make sense&quot;. Being established in Self became an unnatural, ridiculous and=\r\n incomprehensible notion. So the &quot;spirit of comprehension&quot; (Mercury) became=\r\n relevant. An avatara corresponding to Mercury occurred and tried to explai=\r\nn being established in Self as a comprehensible notion, so that rational mi=\r\nnds of that age would accept it to an extent and attempt it.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Avataras occur based on the needs of collective consciousness. Of cour=\r\nse, if one&#39;s consciousness is in a different state from the collective cons=\r\nciousness of that time, the current avatara may not be relevant to one.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I respect Rama, but I=\r\n\n&gt;  worship Krshna.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I am\n&gt;  awestruck by Krishna and wor=\r\nship him, but I see Rama as an ideal that I MAY be able to emulate oneday. =\r\nIn fact, I recommend the approach to others.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Though I sa=\r\nid Rama and Krishna are almost the same, there is a difference between soul=\r\n and perfected mind.

It lists 22 Avataras! It=C2=A0deals with =\r\nthe idea of Avataran, but not with the idea of 9/10 fixed Avataras.=C2=A0It=\r\n also=C2=A0lists Varaha Avatara as the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya as the 10 in=\r\n its list of 22. It is only in other puranas, that we get the focus on 10 A=\r\nvatars, and the term becomes popular. \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And ONLY when w=\r\ne take these 9/10 Avataras, in a fixed sequence=C2=A0of appearence, that we=\r\n get the popular concept of Dasavatara. Else no. I find the evolutionary li=\r\nnk in this concept of 9/10 Avataras too compelling to be ignored.=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;After all, &quot;entire divinity&quot; cannot be encapsula=\r\nted by any form&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This, I am in total agreement with=\r\n. Infact, in the 10th Chapter of Gita when the Supreme explains the various=\r\n vibhutis, this One is not even Krshna, but has transcended every limitatio=\r\nn of conception. Hence, the One says, among those who weild weapons, it is =\r\nRama, and among the Vrishnis it is Krshna! Etc..\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;Fir=\r\nst, he IS mentioned in SB list of avataras as well as Parasara&#39;s list. If h=\r\ne does not &quot;fit&quot; in your &quot;scheme of evolutionary Avatars&quot;, then your concep=\r\nt is possibly wrong and avataras are perhaps not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theo=\r\nrize.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As I said, the SB list contains 22 Avataras. It does=\r\n not focus on the idea of 9/10 Avataras! That is my point. If you take 22 A=\r\nvataras, then these link to grahas are not of any use. For these nine graha=\r\ns, individually or in combination, will represent all Avataras, or for that=\r\n matter everything else in this Universe.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Secondly, if=\r\n we take 10 Avatars and corresponding grahas for each, then what must Kalki=\r\n be? Lagna? But=C2=A0lagna is not a graha.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Or, just su=\r\nrmising, can it be possible that until an Avatara actually descends on the =\r\nearth, his energy and his force cannot be attributed to any graha, but once=\r\n he does appear, it reconfigures things completely? We can only know after =\r\nthe last Avatara comes.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Anyway, I am not looking at th=\r\nis main Avatars from the point of grahas/jyotish at all.

As I said above, Pararsara explicitly said th=\r\nat both Rama and Krishna are poornavataras.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Third, let=\r\n us ask a very fundamental question: What exactly does it mean if an avatar=\r\na is &quot;Lord Himself&quot;?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;While SB talks of Krishna being &quot;Lord Himself&quot; in 1.3.28, it also says=\r\n in 1.3.30: &quot;forms of Supreme Lord, who is in\n&gt;  reality formless (arUpa) a=\r\nnd of the\n&gt;  nature of pure consciousness (chidAtman), are manufactured by =\r\nthe qualities of Maya&quot;. In the next verse, it further compares forms of Lor=\r\nd to clouds in sky and dirt in air. Just as sky *contains* clouds and is be=\r\nyond them, similarly Lord *contains* forms and is beyond them. So, again, w=\r\nhat is the meaning of a specific form that descended on earth being &quot;Lord H=\r\nimself&quot;? I am afraid people may be misinterpreting this notion based on the=\r\nir fancies and conditioning..\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;All beings are made up o=\r\nf paramatma (supreme/absolute being) and jivatma (living/relative being). T=\r\nhe latter portion is dominant in us and is responsible for desires and rebi=\r\nrth. Great avataras descend from a higher portion of paramatma. Very rarely=\r\n avataras descend entirely from paramatma without ANY jivatma portion. Rama=\r\n and Krishna are specific examples given by Parasara.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\nThey are entirely divine, but they do not encapsulate the entire divinity!!=\r\n!!\n&gt;  After all, &quot;entire\n&gt;  divinity&quot; cannot be encapsulated by any form ju=\r\nst as no cloud can contain the entire sky. They take part in the drama obey=\r\ning and executing the divine will but NOT altering it. This applies to Kris=\r\nhna as well as Rama.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Buddha was great spiritual force in this world. But I do not\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; see him fit in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; realizati=\r\non, the one he advocated, is a static realization,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an end in a voi=\r\nd.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;First, he IS mentioned in SB list of avataras as we=\r\nll as Parasara&#39;s list. If he does not &quot;fit&quot; in your &quot;scheme of evolutionary=\r\n Avatars&quot;, then your concept is possibly wrong and avataras are perhaps not=\r\n &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theorize.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Secondly, as per Para=\r\nsara, Buddha corresponds to Mercury, who personifies logical mind and the s=\r\npirit of\n&gt;  investigation and comprehension. Logical mind\n&gt;  and its spirit=\r\n of comprehension are inherently fallible. Even a perfected spirit of compr=\r\nehension is not capable of grasping the Absolute Reality completely, for it=\r\n is beyond comprehension. So, no wonder it simplifies the Incomprehensible =\r\nin an attempt to comprehend! That is what Buddha ended up doing. However, l=\r\nogical mind has a great appeal in the Age of Reason in this Kali yuga. No w=\r\nonder Buddha was/is/will be a great spiritual force in this world in this a=\r\nge.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you dismi=\r\nss Parasara&#39;s linking of planets to avataras as a possible corruption, are =\r\nyou absolutely sure that the verses of SB you are relying on are perfect? (=\r\nIn any case, it&#39;s a different matter that you are only taking some SB verse=\r\ns and ignoring\n&gt;  some as\n&gt;  I\n&gt;  showed!.)\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The bottom=\r\nline as far as I am concerned is that Pararsara&#39;s list actually makes amazi=\r\nngly coherent esoteric sense. The nature of each aspect of consciousness (e=\r\n.g. Buddha - spirit of comprehension, Saturn - spirit of patience & persist=\r\nence, Venus - spirit of happiness etc) and the story of corresponding avata=\r\nra DOES have a highly meaningful connection, esoterically speaking. After a=\r\nll, esoterically is how you really need to understand any higher scriptures=\r\n and notions in them.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If we take scriptures literally =\r\ninstead and draw lopsided conclusions, some would conclude that Shiva is th=\r\ne &quot;supreme&quot; one and other deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; some would conclude that =\r\nSurya is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and other deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; and so on.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;On a different note, =\r\nsomeone\n&gt;  may think that Kali, being Aadyaa, is superior\n&gt;  to Tara and li=\r\nke Kali more. But, some learned yogis have declared them to be essentially =\r\nthe same and some scriptures even prohibited differentiating between them. =\r\nAs I see it, the difference between them is too subtle for even rishis to c=\r\nlearly comprehend. People seeing some significant difference between them a=\r\nre, I am afraid, merely projecting their own conditioning. Same in the case=\r\n of Krishna and Rama. Both were=C2=A0 perfectly detached and fully divine k=\r\narma yogis.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If we think about it, perfected mind (para=\r\nmatma aspect represented by Moon) and soul (paramatma aspect represented by=\r\n Sun) are not really that different. So I am afraid Krishna and Rama are no=\r\nt that different, though the specifics of their stories may be different.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;One last word though. If someone truly believes that Kr=\r\nishna is superior to Rama and worships Krishna (or vice versa!), I am very =\r\nhappy for such a person. My arguments are more for the sake of sharing thin=\r\nking/knowledge and pushing the boundaries of understanding in the long run,=\r\n than changing the minds of anyone in the short run. In the end, everyone o=\r\nf us will have to go through one&#39;s own cycles of various tamasik, rajasik a=\r\nnd saattwik stages of evolution before one starts grasping some fistfuls of=\r\n Reality. These concepts are too subtle for anyone to convince others or be=\r\n absolutely confident oneself!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Krishnarpanamastu, Nara=\r\nsimha -------- Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.vedicastrolog=\r\ner.org/\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;--------\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: rajarshi=\r\n nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-w=\r\nisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Saturday, May 4, 2013 7:34 AM\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Comparing Dasavataras!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Jai Ma!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have a different view point. Let me write =\r\ndown as I see it, in point by point manner.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1. In=\r\n the Bhagwata Purana, there are a list of 22 Avataras of Vishnu. In this li=\r\nst of 22, Varaha Avatara is the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya is the 10th Avatara=\r\n. Dattatreya, Nara-narayana,Vyasa Deva himself are in this list, and then t=\r\nhe Bhagawata Purana goes ontu mention that the Avatars of Vishnu are innume=\r\nrable. In the 10th Canto, Vyasa says all these Avatars, and innumerable oth=\r\ners, are amsas of the Supreme Being while Krshna is &quot;swayam Bhagawan.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2. Of these various possible Avataras, 10, or rather =\r\n9 as I believe, are/have been accorded special mention and significance acr=\r\noss various Hindu spiritual literature, specially those which were composed=\r\n in the Kali-Yuga, namely the Puranas.[When Krshna was alive, it was Kali-S=\r\nandhya, his physical presence had curtailed the full effect of Kali,once he=\r\n left his body, Kali started in full flow. All Puranas were composed after =\r\nthis, hence these are scriptures of the Kali-Yuga, as are Tantras]\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;3. These 10/9 Avataras have a fixed sequence of appearanc=\r\ne. Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krshna, (Bu=\r\nddha) and Kalki. There is an unmistakeable connection of the form and seque=\r\nnce of these main avatars with the evolution of life on earth. From the aqu=\r\natic, to the amphibian, to the land-animal, to the half-animal-half-man, to=\r\n the dwarf man (first human life form who immediately takes possession of t=\r\nhis earth represented by Vamana&#39;s 3 steps), to the Rajashik avatara of Para=\r\nshurama moving around with an axe, to the Sattwa Guna Avatara of Rama, to t=\r\nhe Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, this indicates that spirituality is not=\r\n to be separated into another world, but is a progressive realization of th=\r\ne various manifestation and potentials that lie inherent in the consciousne=\r\nss and its development through various life-forms. Larger spirituality of e=\r\narth and evolution go hand in hand. That is Nature&#39;s grand design for life =\r\non\n&gt;  earth.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;4. In this specifc context, I am onl=\r\ny focusing on the parable of these main 9/10 Avatars. It is not my contenti=\r\non that if one worships say Matysa Avatara, one will not attain to a state =\r\nof liberation of the soul. As is the nature of spiritual cosmology in Hindu=\r\nism, any Devata can lead a person to any depth of realization. And each one=\r\n of the Avatars of Vishnu are self-realized in their own way and can be con=\r\nsider super-massive spiritual dynamos.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A05. Of these, naturally, Rama and Krshna are most adored because they =\r\nrepresent a stage of evolution, both inside as well as outside, which socie=\r\nty can relate of much easier, in this age. Rama represents, for me, the sta=\r\nge of most satwic mind. A satwic mind is in control of itself. It known how=\r\n to transform the animal tendencies within and without - monkeys - into a c=\r\nonstructive force for a greater purpose. However, as with a state of full S=\r\nattwa Guna, there can be instances, even though few, of dejection. For it i=\r\ns static in nature and will change only when circumstances force it to. As =\r\nper the Valmiki Ramayana, Rama did feel dejected while searching for Sita i=\r\nn the forest. He did have a moments fear before the final assault on Ravana=\r\n, which was dispelled by Agsatha when the later revealed the stotra of the =\r\nSun to Rama. At the end of the final battle, Rama tells Sita, in a most dis=\r\npassionate manner, that he killed Ravana not to rescue her, but it\n&gt;  was t=\r\nhe Dharma to do so, and to unhold his family honour. That too was the dharm=\r\na of that age when he lived, family honor. The way I look at this grand epi=\r\nc, and I bow humbly to the genius of Rishis Valmiki for representing the th=\r\nings as they are, as a scribe, as a poet, as an observer, and not adding hi=\r\ns own preferences to it anywhere, in the 14 years of tribulation that Rama =\r\nfaced which culminated into his killing Ravana, he changed into the most di=\r\nspassionate leader, such that no personal consideration or emotions or pass=\r\nions can overturn the Rajadharma. His life is a lesson of what a true leade=\r\nr must be! Krshna, OTOH, had this immaculate detachment right from birth. I=\r\n am not taking his=C2=A0 supernatural feats into account. It is his singula=\r\nr and constant detachment from situations, from people, from environment, f=\r\nrom circumstances that mark his life. At the age of eight, he decides to le=\r\nave Vrindavana for Mathura. All his friends, his foster parents,\n&gt;  his vil=\r\nlage-folks who so loved him, pleaded with him that it would make no sense f=\r\nor him to leave the shelter, love and comfort of his happy, settled village=\r\n life and head into an unknown destiny and destination. Krshna tried to rea=\r\nson with them, then he understood that they won&#39;t understand, he promised h=\r\ne will return back once his work in Mathura is over. He never returned. Lat=\r\ner, much later, when the Gopis came to him asking him to participate in the=\r\nir dance, he obliged. But the moment some of them started getting jealous a=\r\nnd possessive of Krshna, he removed himself quietly from the scene, saying =\r\nthat he belongs to everyone equally and no one has any special right over h=\r\nim. When Shishupala abused Krshna, the later merely kept dropping flowers o=\r\nn the floor, smiling and counting. The moment the 100th abuse was over, he =\r\nswiftly cut off Shishupala&#39;s head and was back into his poise. But when Bhu=\r\nrishrava unfairly accused Krshna of being a revolutionist\n&gt;  and charlatan,=\r\n Krshna did not kill him. When Duryodhana, who used to think of Krshna as a=\r\nnother black magician, wanted to arrest him, Krshna showed his vikarala roo=\r\npa in the assembly of kings, yet he did not finish the enemies off. The ver=\r\ny next moment he was back into his own poised self. Never in the whole Maha=\r\nbharata is there one instance of his going overboard, never a single shade =\r\nof depression, equivocation, or lack of confidence in his actions, irrespec=\r\ntive of what others say or think of him. And then right in the middle of th=\r\ne greatest war he had the perfect equipoise to deliver the most sublime spi=\r\nritual philosophy. That is why his life remains the best ideal of Karma-Yog=\r\na. For a true Karma-Yogi by definition can never be dejected. It is impossi=\r\nble. Neither the action nor the results belong to the instrument. When runn=\r\ning away from the battle-field and killing Kaliya Yavana, or when advising =\r\nBheema to tear apart Jarashanda, or gesturing Bheema\n&gt;  to hit Duryodhana b=\r\nelow the waist, or getting Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krshna, as if by some =\r\nDivine Intuition, knew exactly how the situations must be lined up which wo=\r\nuld cause the destruction of these people. This kind of knowledge cannot co=\r\nme by the rational thinking. But happens when one is constantly and conscio=\r\nusly connected to the Universal Force. We do not find these kind of complex=\r\n situations in the Rama Avatara, at least in the Valmiki Ramayana. Of cours=\r\ne, if we take the Adhbut Ramayana or such other auxilliary texts and retell=\r\ning, we get a different picture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana we have a 1000 hea=\r\nded demon attacking Rama after he kills Ravana, and then Sita turns into Ad=\r\nya Shakti and demolishes the 1000 headed demon and Rama worships her. But i=\r\nf we take only the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the picture that emerges i=\r\ns very clear. Rama is the embodiment of Sattwic mind. Therefore he displays=\r\n all the great characteristics of satwa, chief\n&gt;  of which is self-control,=\r\n as well as the occasional sadness caused due to separation from his wife S=\r\nita whom, at least until Ravana was destroyed, he loved very dearly. Satwa =\r\nguna creates a true saint, but can also cause some grief when the stability=\r\n is shaken. Krshna was gunatita. He had no attachment to anything in this w=\r\norld - man, women, deva, danava, friend, enemy - and therefore he was never=\r\n affected any trace of negative emotion. His Ananda never left him \n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
