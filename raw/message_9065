I did not mean =\r\nto say otherwise.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;But just having an ishta devata is not enough to=\r\n be &quot;protected&quot; from deep and troublesome instabilities when one&#39;s body-min=\r\nd complex goes through a big transformation. Not every aspiring devotee bec=\r\nomes a Prahlada - some become Ravanas. After all, out of the two examples L=\r\neelaji gave below for &quot;psychological disorder&quot;, the second lady &quot;did much s=\r\nadhana of Srirama&quot;. Even those who think of a deity and pray to him/her can=\r\n end up with hallucinations, mental and spiritual disorders, wrong (colored=\r\n by one&#39;s conditioning and desires!) interpretation of internal/external ex=\r\nperiences and even madness.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;True surrender/devotion to ishta devat=\r\na will definitely protect one, but\n cultivating it is as difficult as culti=\r\nvating detachment through wisdom! In fact, true surrender and detachment ar=\r\ne almost the same.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;This is why I said that *lightness of condition=\r\ning* is the most important thing. One with dense conditioning will find SOM=\r\nE way to fail even if a great guru or god are ready to help.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Now, the question is: How do we reduce our conditionin=\r\ng? Unfortunately, there is no single magic bullet. Thinking of a god, mantr=\r\nas, bhajans, japam, homam etc can help, but they need to be augmented by re=\r\ngular introspection and self-improvement.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Taking mind away from it=\r\ns current pre-occupations (e.g. &quot;I am smart&quot;, &quot;I am doing good sadhana&quot;, &quot;I=\r\n am mad at X&quot;, &quot;I did not get what I deserve in Y&quot;, &quot;I am better than X&quot;, &quot;=\r\nI must have Y at any cost&quot; etc etc) is key to eventually overcoming conditi=\r\noning, for\n these thoughts keep *reinforcing* the conditioning!\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;To=\r\n reduce the regular pre-occupations of mind, different imagery/visualizatio=\r\nn may work better for some people.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;One approach is to contemplate =\r\ngod whenever possible, in the middle of any activity. You can imagine a bei=\r\nng in your mind, either as an ideal/able person or as a principle/ideal/abi=\r\nlity that exists in many beings, that is so perfect and fascinating for the=\r\n mind to contemplate that it does not care about other objects around that =\r\nare making shadripus and ashtapashas work on the mind. Whenever mind is abo=\r\nut to entertain its regular debilitating pre-occupations, one can try to co=\r\nntemplate god instead.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Mind is a wild animal. As Pi says in the mo=\r\nvie &quot;Life of Pi&quot; about the tiger on the boat, wild animals can&#39;t be transfo=\r\nrmed or domesticated, but they can be trained into some habits!\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Wh=\r\nenever one is enjoying a sensual pleasure, if one thinks &quot;the\n omnipresent =\r\nGod is enjoying this thru this instrument&quot; and starts contemplating the qua=\r\nlities of that god instead of thinking too much about limited sense objects=\r\n, one is better placed to reduce the damage done by shadripus. Whenever one=\r\n is angry at someone for what they did, if one thinks &quot;the omnipresent God =\r\nis giving me the fruits of my karmas thru that instrument&quot; and starts conte=\r\nmplating the qualities of that god instead of being angry at someone, one i=\r\ns better placed to reduce the damage done by shadripus. And so on.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt;In the beginning, even contemplation of god becomes laced with ego. Every =\r\nnow and then, the activity ends up becoming about oneself rather than about=\r\n god (&quot;*I* am doing this nice bhajan&quot;, &quot;*I* am doing this nice homam&quot;, &quot;I t=\r\nhink *I* am making progress through this&quot;). With effort and perseverance, o=\r\nne can avoid making it about oneself and keep it centered on the supreme po=\r\nwer that runs the show. Just as it takes a long\n time to train a wild anima=\r\nl, it takes a long time to train mind!\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Try to develop devotion and=\r\n surrender. Based on all that you read and heard, develop of a concept/prin=\r\nciple of god that is so superb and fascinarting. Visualize/contemplate that=\r\n concept as frequently as possible, especially when meditating. When mind v=\r\neers off into other things, gently steer it back. Don&#39;t spend too much time=\r\n dissecting what mind is doing and why. Just put it back gently into contem=\r\nplating god. Try to make it about god rather than about yourself.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\nThe main drawback of the sadhana of most people is that they make it about =\r\nthemselves at some level or the other. Though that is unavoidable, try to b=\r\nreak free from it.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Finally, one can try =\r\nto overcome the limited sense of self and engage in selfless actions that b=\r\nenefit a larger set of\n people than oneself. What stops us from truly lovin=\r\ng god is our deep and sub-conscious love for *ourselves* (i.e. our *limited=\r\n* notion of self that drives the current body-mind complex). One way to ove=\r\nrcome that is to selflessly love others. After all, other people around us =\r\nare as much replicas of god as we are. If we cannot empathize with them, lo=\r\nve them and give them unconditionally, how can we ever hope to transcend th=\r\ne limited sense of Self and truly love omnipresent God?\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;Best reg=\r\nards,\n&gt;Narasimha\n&gt;--------\n&gt;Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.=\r\nVedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;--------\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;________________________________\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; From: Leela Sastry &lt;leela.sastry@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, February 28, 201=\r\n3 10:35 PM\n&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Kundalini syndrome\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0Dear Friends ,\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0All psychosomatic or schizophrenic c=\r\nases are not defined as=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 wrongly=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 experim=\r\nented=C2=A0=C2=A0kundalini=C2=A0=C2=A0 experiences .

It is just A SMALL=\r\n STEP in overcoming one&#39;s current limited identity.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Let me giv=\r\ne an analogy. One wanting to move from one&#39;s small dilapidated house (this =\r\nbody-mind complex) to a huge palace (realized Self) may first construct the=\r\n palace over time and\n move into it when it is COMPLETE. Alternately, if on=\r\ne occasionally goes and stays in the palace still under construction (analo=\r\ngy for out of body experiences due to Kundalini rise), is it an achievement=\r\n? In fact, it comes with risks. The former approach is safer and one loses =\r\nnothing in it. Similarly, one can progress towards complete Self-realizatio=\r\nn without any out of body experiences. These are not my word&#39;s, but Maharsh=\r\ni Vasishtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Secondly, one does not get s=\r\nomething without wanting it and putting sufficient effort towards it. One m=\r\nay have deeply desired a Kundalini rise in a previous life and may have put=\r\n enough effort. As a result, one may be getting it now. But one may be unpr=\r\nepared (and ironically may not even want it!) when it comes in this life.\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;As you do sadhana, try not to fancy too many specific desires. =\r\nNature has a delay mechanism in granting your desires (because of constrain=\r\nts on what\n Nature can give you right now, arising from YOUR OWN previous a=\r\nctions). So Nature sometimes gives you what you want LATE, when you no long=\r\ner want it or want something else. For example, one may pray for great weal=\r\nth one&#39;s whole life and be born as a rich but very sick man in next life. O=\r\nne may not enjoy that wealth and pray whole life for health. In the life af=\r\nter that, one may be very healthy, but not have any knowledge or money. In =\r\nanother case, one may deeply desire to act in a famous film. One may be reb=\r\norn as a tiger or a dog and act in a famous film, but not really enjoy that=\r\n experience. Basically, people keep going in circles through various lives,=\r\n always &quot;seeking&quot; something they are &quot;missing&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Anyway, coming=\r\n back to Kundalini, if one deeply desires an out of body experience given b=\r\ny a rising Kundalini and one&#39;s\n previous karmas constrain one from having i=\r\nt in THIS life, one may be born in next life with this specific desire dest=\r\nined to fructify (if there is enough karmik force behind it).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessarily scary or pain=\r\nful, if one is well-prepared in terms of attitude and detachment.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap. I went to free it and it p=\r\nanicked so badly and started to shake violently. I went to save it from a c=\r\nertain slow death and it was scared that I would kill it!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;We a=\r\nre like that chipmunk, glued to the mouse trap called this body-mind comple=\r\nx and scared of being rescued from a certain slow death!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;If ou=\r\nr ideas about who we are (viz this current body-mind complex) are incorrect=\r\n and if we are this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a complete reali=\r\nzation of that at some\n stage involve stepping out of this body-mind comple=\r\nx, without being scared?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Kundalini=\r\n rise after most undesirable conditioning is overcome, is far better than K=\r\nundalini rise forced when some really undesirable conditioning is still lef=\r\nt in one&#39;s system.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;When one transcends one problematic notion =\r\nabout who one is and what one needs, another notion that lay buried deeper =\r\nin consciousness may spring to the surface and torment one. If one overcome=\r\ns the notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there may be another notion in one&#39;s body-min=\r\nd complex that one&#39;s awareness clings on to (e.g. a great doctor, a great l=\r\neader, a great scholar, a great saint etc). As an extreme example, if one p=\r\nerson had a hidden deep desire to be a great soul who rescues the world, he=\r\n may fancy that he is a re-incarnated X or Y who will rescue the world now.=\r\n When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!) deeply clings to any such noti=\r\non, it can cause havoc. The person may show some signs of progress and yet =\r\nremain in ignorance and get stuck badly.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;An awakened Kundalini=\r\n in a system with undesirable conditioning may accentuate one&#39;s weaknesses =\r\nand wrong notions heavily and cause serious psychiatric and spiritual probl=\r\nems.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;The best approach I recommend=\r\n is to NOT think in terms of Kundalini and its rise. Just do sadhana, overc=\r\nome your weaknesses and improve your detachment over time. Again, I want to=\r\n emphasize that detachment is not disgust or distaste for life/things/peopl=\r\ne around you. Disgust is the other side of coin of attachment. It is a nega=\r\ntive attachment. =C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Don&#39;t worry about whether your Kundalini rises o=\r\nr not. Worry about whether you are able to resist 6 internal enemies (shadr=\r\nipus) and 8 bondages (ashta pashas) or not. If your ability to resist them =\r\nis increasing, you are making progress. EVEN IF your Kundalini is fast asle=\r\nep, you are still making progress. When you completely overcome them, Kunda=\r\nlini (your self-awareness) will automatically ascend to the top and meet He=\r\nr Lord (true Self).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;One word on surre=\r\nndering to a personal deity. Though true surrender is helpful, most people =\r\ndo not have it. They simply do business with god. Though people may be offe=\r\nnded by my words, this is the plain and bare fact.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I want X, =\r\nI will pray to you and please give it to me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of Kundalini ris=\r\ne, I will pray to you and please protect me&quot; - all this is just a business =\r\ndeal. There is something you want and you ask god for it. True surrender ha=\r\ns no place for agendas, desires, demands or expectations. True surrender is=\r\n losing oneself in one&#39;s fascination for the qualities of Lord. True surren=\r\nder is accepting anything Lord throws one&#39;s way (whether it is pleasurable =\r\nor highly painful) as Lord&#39;s prasad and accepting it gratefully. True surre=\r\nnder is thinking of Lord with fascination and pleasure, even in the face of=\r\n (and during) Death.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;If one without true surrender and with ma=\r\nny desires and wrong notions experiences a Kundalini rise, one may still be=\r\n trapped, despite thinking of a personal god. It is not that god does not w=\r\nant to &quot;protect&quot; one as said below. It is not about protecting or endangeri=\r\nng. If you go back to my &quot;chipmunk glued to mouse trap&quot; example above, I wa=\r\ns trying to protect it, but it was scared. Similarly, one&#39;s conditioning ma=\r\nkes one *run away* from God&#39;s protection! God&#39;s protection may seem to a co=\r\nnditioned mind like grave danger that\n one should run away from!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Whether through the path of wisdom or surren=\r\nder, develop dispassion and detachment. Realize that all this is temporary =\r\nand can be taken away anytime. Enjoy it while you have and keep doing your =\r\nbest, but be prepared to lose everything anytime. Only detachment and a ver=\r\ny light mental conditioning (very light desires, dislikes etc) can protect =\r\none as one&#39;s Kundalini rises to meet True Self. Heavy conditioning and impu=\r\nrities in one&#39;s nadis will distract rising Kundalini (self-awareness) and s=\r\ntop Her from meeting True Self.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;The real key is how light your=\r\n conditioning is.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Best regards, Narasimha -------- Astrology &=\r\n Spirituality Resources: http://www.vedicastrologer.org/\n&gt;&gt;&gt;--------\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;From: Leela Sastry &lt;leela.sastry@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;vedic-w=\r\nisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, =\r\nFebruary 28, 2013 6:05 AM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrom=\r\ne\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0YES=C2=A0 SIR=C2=A0 , perfectly correct=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 ,=C2=A0but intense bhakthi and saranagathi=C2=A0 makes the ishtadeva=\r\ntha to stand by the sadhaka and remove most of the hurdles .=C2=A0=C2=A0All=\r\n the so called dhyanamargas with out any personal deity and manthra allow t=\r\nhe other entities to enter in to the inner planes who play havoc with the=\r\n=C2=A0 psyche .=C2=A0 Once we are under the protection of=C2=A0 a mahadevat=\r\nha ,all the other=C2=A0 disturbances will definitely=C2=A0 be wiped off .

Co=\r\nnstant efforts of purification of the various elements that compose the hum=\r\nan mind-body structure. In simpler words this translates into more detachme=\r\nnt, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, greed e=\r\ntc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, one has to n=\r\now self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a far more=\r\n intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 - A goo=\r\nd guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really does - it=\r\n can also open up the mind and body to various other things and entities, s=\r\nome of which are not postive in nature while some of them are useless, and =\r\ngiven half a chance can make use of the individual for its own ends. They t=\r\nake hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and miss-utilizes th=\r\ne same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more\n vital. 4 - While som=\r\neday or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini Shakti awe=\r\nkening and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are because of this. T=\r\nhe human psychology as understood by west today is puerile and insufficient=\r\n to deal with various things. It is also possible sometimes that the aura o=\r\nf an individual, which protects us from various subtle influences and helps=\r\n us to remain as functional entities, can get &quot;ruptured&quot; due to various rea=\r\nsons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can allow=\r\n free assess of various entities inside the mind and they have chances of c=\r\nausing serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and various possibli=\r\nties are there, it is not possible to list down every option. Moreover, eve=\r\nn if such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few can have the right knowle=\r\ndge to rectify the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are often doin=\r\ng nothing more than an intelligent guess work.\n Sometimes it will have resu=\r\nlts, sometimes not. For all these to be achieved, the starting point is a s=\r\nound mind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used to say - Mens sana in=\r\n corpore sano. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApa=\r\nnnam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:=\r\n24]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To=\r\n: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, 28 February 2013 1:50 =\r\nPM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\nDear all, Just wanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome based on my rece=\r\nnt experience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at present,=\r\n and have been involved in the care of someone who seems to think she has h=\r\nad a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since childhood. This has inv=\r\nolved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the body. She is not =\r\nof Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms starte=\r\nd and she searched for an explanation. We have not been able to find anythi=\r\nng physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that this i=\r\ns due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill describe them=\r\nselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awak=\r\nening- this has triggered interest and research into this topic in mainstre=\r\nam psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-understood by west=\r\nern medicine, and as we have no treatments for deranged\n kundalini, we stru=\r\nggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My exper=\r\nience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not be forc=\r\nibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at times because the sufferi=\r\nng from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her, and i=\r\nt is something she cannot escape from. I wondered what solution there could=\r\n be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who m=\r\nanifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and eithe=\r\nr cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. May I request that the g=\r\nood samaritans among you pray for her, and for others like her (whom we may=\r\n not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. And let us be careful in=\r\n our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this =\r\nis why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say &quot;let me =\r\nbe your instrument&quot; and leave the kundalini\n rising bit to God&#39;s will.

I did not mean to sa=\r\ny otherwise.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;But just having an ishta\n devata is not enough to=\r\n be &quot;protected&quot; from deep and troublesome instabilities when one&#39;s body-min=\r\nd complex goes through a big transformation. Not every aspiring devotee bec=\r\nomes a Prahlada - some become Ravanas. After all, out of the two examples L=\r\neelaji gave below for &quot;psychological disorder&quot;, the second lady &quot;did much s=\r\nadhana of Srirama&quot;. Even those who think of a deity and pray to him/her can=\r\n end up with hallucinations, mental and spiritual disorders, wrong (colored=\r\n by one&#39;s conditioning and desires!) interpretation of internal/external ex=\r\nperiences and even madness.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;True surrender/devotion to ishta d=\r\nevata will definitely protect one, but\n cultivating it is as difficult as c=\r\nultivating detachment through wisdom! In fact, true surrender and detachmen=\r\nt are almost the same.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;This is why I said that *lightness of c=\r\nonditioning* is the most important thing. One with dense conditioning will =\r\nfind SOME way to fail even if a great guru or god are ready to help.&lt;br&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Now, the question is: How do we reduce o=\r\nur conditioning? Unfortunately, there is no single magic bullet. Thinking o=\r\nf a god, mantras, bhajans, japam, homam etc can help, but they need to be a=\r\nugmented by regular introspection and self-improvement.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Taking=\r\n mind away from its current pre-occupations (e.g. &quot;I am smart&quot;, &quot;I am doing=\r\n good sadhana&quot;, &quot;I am mad at X&quot;, &quot;I did not get what I deserve in Y&quot;, &quot;I am=\r\n better than X&quot;, &quot;I must have Y at any cost&quot; etc etc) is key to eventually =\r\novercoming conditioning, for\n these thoughts keep *reinforcing* the conditi=\r\noning!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;To reduce the regular pre-occupations of mind, differen=\r\nt imagery/visualization may work better for some people.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;One a=\r\npproach is to contemplate god whenever possible, in the middle of any activ=\r\nity. You can imagine a being in your mind, either as an ideal/able person o=\r\nr as a principle/ideal/ability that exists in many beings, that is so perfe=\r\nct and fascinating for the mind to contemplate that it does not care about =\r\nother objects around that are making shadripus and ashtapashas work on the =\r\nmind. Whenever mind is about to entertain its regular debilitating pre-occu=\r\npations, one can try to contemplate god instead.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Mind is a wil=\r\nd animal. As Pi says in the movie &quot;Life of Pi&quot; about the tiger on the boat,=\r\n wild animals can&#39;t be transformed or domesticated, but they can be trained=\r\n into some habits!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Whenever one is enjoying a sensual pleasure=\r\n, if one thinks &quot;the\n omnipresent God is enjoying this thru this instrument=\r\n&quot; and starts contemplating the qualities of that god instead of thinking to=\r\no much about limited sense objects, one is better placed to reduce the dama=\r\nge done by shadripus. Whenever one is angry at someone for what they did, i=\r\nf one thinks &quot;the omnipresent God is giving me the fruits of my karmas thru=\r\n that instrument&quot; and starts contemplating the qualities of that god instea=\r\nd of being angry at someone, one is better placed to reduce the damage done=\r\n by shadripus. And so on.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;In the beginning, even contemplation=\r\n of god becomes laced with ego. Every now and then, the activity ends up be=\r\ncoming about oneself rather than about god (&quot;*I* am doing this nice bhajan&quot;=\r\n, &quot;*I* am doing this nice homam&quot;, &quot;I think *I* am making progress through t=\r\nhis&quot;). With effort and perseverance, one can avoid making it about oneself =\r\nand keep it centered on the supreme power that runs the show. Just as it ta=\r\nkes a long\n time to train a wild animal, it takes a long time to train mind=\r\n!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Try to develop devotion and surrender. Based on all that you=\r\n read and heard, develop of a concept/principle of god that is so superb an=\r\nd fascinarting. Visualize/contemplate that concept as frequently as possibl=\r\ne, especially when meditating. When mind veers off into other things, gentl=\r\ny steer it back. Don&#39;t spend too much time dissecting what mind is doing an=\r\nd why. Just put it back gently into contemplating god. Try to make it about=\r\n god rather than about yourself.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The main drawback of the sadh=\r\nana of most people is that they make it about themselves at some level or t=\r\nhe other. Though that is unavoidable, try to break free from it.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Finally, one can try to overcome the limited=\r\n sense of self and engage in selfless actions that benefit a larger set of\n=\r\n people than oneself. What stops us from truly loving god is our deep and s=\r\nub-conscious love for *ourselves* (i.e. our *limited* notion of self that d=\r\nrives the current body-mind complex). One way to overcome that is to selfle=\r\nssly love others. After all, other people around us are as much replicas of=\r\n god as we are. If we cannot empathize with them, love them and give them u=\r\nnconditionally, how can we ever hope to transcend the limited sense of Self=\r\n and truly love omnipresent God?&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0,=\r\n 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;backgrou=\r\nnd-color:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;----=\r\n----&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=\r\n=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrol=\r\noger.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-fami=\r\nly:arial, helvetica, clean,\n sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-s=\r\ntyle:normal;&quot;&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left=\r\n:2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);margin-left:5px;margin-top:5px;padding-left:5px=\r\n;&quot;&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;=\r\n&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-s=\r\nize:12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;=\r\n1&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Leela Sastry &lt=\r\n;leela.sastry@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Thursday, Febr=\r\nuary 28, 2013 10:35 PM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Kundalini syndrome&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv id=3D&quot;yiv353263917&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv353263917ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      =\r\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:times new roman,=\r\n new york, times, serif;font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;Dear Friends ,&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;All psychosomatic or schizophrenic cases are no=\r\nt defined as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrongly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; experimented&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;kundalini&nbsp;&nbsp; experiences .

It is just A SMALL STEP in overcoming one&#39;s current limited identity.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Let me give an analogy. One wanting to move from one&#39;s small di=\r\nlapidated house (this body-mind complex) to a huge palace (realized Self) m=\r\nay first construct the palace over time and\n move into it when it is COMPLE=\r\nTE. Alternately, if one occasionally goes and stays in the palace still und=\r\ner construction (analogy for out of body experiences due to Kundalini rise)=\r\n, is it an achievement? In fact, it comes with risks. The former approach i=\r\ns safer and one loses nothing in it. Similarly, one can progress towards co=\r\nmplete Self-realization without any out of body experiences. These are not =\r\nmy word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Second=\r\nly, one does not get something without wanting it and putting sufficient ef=\r\nfort towards it. One may have deeply desired a Kundalini rise in a previous=\r\n life and may have put enough effort. As a result, one may be getting it no=\r\nw. But one may be unprepared (and ironically may not even want it!) when it=\r\n comes in this life.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;As you do sadhana, try not to fancy too m=\r\nany specific desires. Nature has a delay mechanism in granting your desires=\r\n (because of constraints on what\n Nature can give you right now, arising fr=\r\nom YOUR OWN previous actions). So Nature sometimes gives you what you want =\r\nLATE, when you no longer want it or want something else. For example, one m=\r\nay pray for great wealth one&#39;s whole life and be born as a rich but very si=\r\nck man in next life. One may not enjoy that wealth and pray whole life for =\r\nhealth. In the life after that, one may be very healthy, but not have any k=\r\nnowledge or money. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv353263917yui_3_7_2_19_136206784661=\r\n9_141&quot;&gt;In another case, one may deeply desire to act in a famous film. One =\r\nmay be reborn as a tiger or a dog and act in a famous film, but not really =\r\nenjoy that experience. Basically, people &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv353263917yui=\r\n_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&quot;&gt;keep going in circles through various lives, a=\r\nlways &quot;seeking&quot; something they are &quot;missing&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, coming b=\r\nack to Kundalini, if one deeply desires an out of body experience given by =\r\na rising Kundalini and one&#39;s\n previous karmas constrain one from having it =\r\nin THIS life, one may be born in next life with this specific desire destin=\r\ned to fructify (if there is enough karmik force behind it).&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessarily scary or painfu=\r\nl, if one is well-prepared in terms of attitude and detachment.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap. I went to free it and it pan=\r\nicked so badly and started to shake violently. I went to save it from a cer=\r\ntain slow death and it was scared that I would kill it!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;We are=\r\n like that chipmunk, glued to the mouse trap called this body-mind complex =\r\nand scared of being rescued from a certain slow death!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If our =\r\nideas about who we are (viz this current body-mind complex) are incorrect a=\r\nnd if we are this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a complete realiza=\r\ntion of that at some\n stage involve stepping out of this body-mind complex,=\r\n without being scared?&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Kundalini r=\r\nise after most undesirable conditioning is overcome, is far better than Kun=\r\ndalini rise forced when some really undesirable conditioning is still left =\r\nin one&#39;s system.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;When one transcends one problematic notion ab=\r\nout who one is and what one needs, another notion that lay buried deeper in=\r\n consciousness may spring to the surface and torment one. If one overcomes =\r\nthe notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there may be another notion in one&#39;s body-mind =\r\ncomplex that one&#39;s awareness clings on to (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv353263917y=\r\nui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yiv353263917userContent&quot;&gt;e.g.=\r\n a great doctor, a great leader, a great scholar, a great saint etc&lt;/span&gt;)=\r\n. As an extreme example, if one person had a hidden deep desire to be a gre=\r\nat soul who\n rescues\n the world, he may fancy that he is a re-incarnated X =\r\nor Y who will rescue the world now. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kundali=\r\nni!) deeply clings to any such notion, it can cause havoc. The person may s=\r\nhow some signs of progress and yet remain in ignorance and get stuck badly.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;An awakened Kundalini in a system with undesirable conditioni=\r\nng may accentuate one&#39;s weaknesses and wrong notions heavily and cause seri=\r\nous psychiatric and spiritual problems.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;br id=3D&quot;yiv353263917yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_158&quot;&gt;The best approach I=\r\n recommend is to NOT think in terms of Kundalini and its rise. Just do sadh=\r\nana, overcome your weaknesses and improve your detachment over time. Again,=\r\n I want to emphasize that detachment is not disgust or distaste for life/th=\r\nings/people around you. Disgust is the other side of coin of attachment.&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt; It is a\n negative attachment. &nbsp;&lt;/div&gt; \n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-C=\r\nOLOR:transparent;FONT-STYLE:normal;FONT-FAMILY:arial, helvetica, sans-serif=\r\n;COLOR:rgb(0,0,0);FONT-SIZE:13px;&quot; id=3D&quot;yiv353263917yui_3_7_2_19_136206784=\r\n6619_155&quot;&gt;D&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv353263917yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&quot;&gt;on&#39;t wor=\r\nry about whether your Kundalini rises or not.

Though true surrender is helpful, most people do not have it. They simply=\r\n do business with god. Though people may be offended by my words, this is t=\r\nhe plain and bare fact.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I want X, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv35326=\r\n3917yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv353263917yui_3_7_2_19_13=\r\n62067846619_141&quot;&gt;I will pray to you and &lt;/span&gt;please give it to me&quot;, &quot;I am=\r\n scared of Kundalini rise, I will pray to you and please protect me&quot; - all =\r\nthis is just a business deal. There is something you want and you ask\n god =\r\nfor it. True surrender has no place for agendas, desires, demands or expect=\r\nations. True surrender is losing oneself in one&#39;s fascination for the quali=\r\nties of Lord. True surrender is accepting anything Lord throws one&#39;s way (w=\r\nhether it is pleasurable or highly painful) as Lord&#39;s prasad and accepting =\r\nit gratefully. True surrender is thinking of Lord with fascination and plea=\r\nsure, even in the face of (and during) Death.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If one without t=\r\nrue surrender and with many desires and wrong notions experiences a Kundali=\r\nni rise, one may still be trapped, despite thinking of a personal god. It i=\r\ns not that god does not want to &quot;protect&quot; one as said below. It is not abou=\r\nt protecting or endangering. If you go back to my &quot;chipmunk glued to mouse =\r\ntrap&quot; example above, I was trying to protect it, but it was scared. Similar=\r\nly, one&#39;s conditioning makes one *run away* from God&#39;s protection! God&#39;s pr=\r\notection may seem to a conditioned mind like grave danger that\n one should =\r\nrun away from!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv353263917yui_3_7_2_19_136=\r\n2067846619_141&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv353263917yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&quot;&gt;*&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Whether through the path of wisdom or surre=\r\nnder, develop dispassion and detachment. Realize that all this is temporary=\r\n and can be taken away anytime. Enjoy it while you have and keep doing your=\r\n best, but be prepared to lose everything anytime. Only detachment and a ve=\r\nry light mental conditioning (very light desires, dislikes etc) can protect=\r\n one as one&#39;s Kundalini rises to meet True Self.

Constan=\r\nt efforts of purification of the various elements that compose the human mi=\r\nnd-body structure. In simpler words this translates into more detachment, m=\r\nore equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, greed etc et=\r\nc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, one has to now se=\r\nlf identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a far more inte=\r\nnse kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 - A good gur=\r\nu is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really does - it can =\r\nalso open up the mind and body to various other things and entities, some o=\r\nf which are not postive in nature while some of them are useless, and given=\r\n half a chance can make\n use of the individual for its own ends. They take =\r\nhold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and miss-utilizes the sa=\r\nme. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more vital. 4 - While someday =\r\nor other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini Shakti awekenin=\r\ng and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are because of this. The hu=\r\nman psychology as understood by west today is puerile and insufficient to d=\r\neal with various things. It is also possible sometimes that the aura of an =\r\nindividual, which protects us from various subtle influences and helps us t=\r\no remain as functional entities, can get &quot;ruptured&quot; due to various reasons,=\r\n high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can allow free=\r\n assess of various entities inside the mind and they have chances of causin=\r\ng serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and various possiblities =\r\nare there, it is not possible to list down every option. Moreover, even if =\r\nsuch a diagnosis\n is correctly done, very few can have the right knowledge =\r\nto rectify the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are often doing no=\r\nthing more than an intelligent guess work. Sometimes it will have results, =\r\nsometimes not. For all these to be achieved, the starting point is a sound =\r\nmind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used to say - &lt;span class=3D&quot;yi=\r\nv353263917st&quot;&gt;Mens sana in corpore sano.&lt;/span&gt; -Regards &nbsp;Rajarshi \n&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv353263917MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:16px;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv353263917Apple-style-span&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;COLOR:rgb(153,153,153);&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv353263917Apple-style-span&quot;&gt;&lt;/span=\r\n&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:times new roman, new york, times=\r\n, serif;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv353263917yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249950 yiv353263917yui_=\r\n3_7_2_19_1362067846619_92&quot;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana;COLOR:navy;FONT-SIZE:10pt;&quot; cla=\r\nss=3D&quot;yiv353263917yui_3_2_0_2_134243506227946 yiv353263917yui_3_2_0_2_13424=\r\n3527249952 yiv353263917yui_3_7_2_17_1362045432997_73 yiv353263917yui_3_7_2_=\r\n19_1362067846619_93&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt; \n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font=\r\n&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:=\r\nCourier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;FONT-SIZE:12pt;&quot; class=\r\n=3D&quot;yiv353263917yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_95&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:t=\r\nimes new roman, new york, times, serif;FONT-SIZE:12pt;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv3532639=\r\n17yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_96&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; siz=\r\ne=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BORDER-BOTTOM:#ccc 1px solid;BORDER-LEFT:#ccc 1px so=\r\nlid;HEIGHT:0px;FONT-SIZE:0px;BORDER-TOP:#ccc 1px solid;BORDER-RIGHT:#ccc 1p=\r\nx solid;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv353263917hr&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold=\r\n;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com=\r\n &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Thursday, 28 Feb=\r\nruary 2013 1:50 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;=\r\n/b&gt; [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv353263=\r\n917&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv353263917ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Dea=\r\nr all, Just wanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome based on my recent =\r\nexperience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at present, an=\r\nd have been involved in the care of someone who seems to think she has had =\r\na spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since childhood. This has involv=\r\ned out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the body. She is not of =\r\nIndian origin and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms started a=\r\nnd she searched for an explanation. We have not been able to find anything =\r\nphysically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that this is d=\r\nue to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill describe themsel=\r\nves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakeni=\r\nng- this has triggered interest and research into this topic in mainstream =\r\npsychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-understood by western=\r\n medicine, and as we have no treatments for deranged\n kundalini, we struggl=\r\ne to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My experien=\r\nce with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not be forcibl=\r\ny wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at times because the suffering =\r\nfrom the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her, and it i=\r\ns something she cannot escape from. I wondered what solution there could be=\r\n to her problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who mani=\r\nfests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and either c=\r\nure her, or give her the strength to bear this. May I request that the good=\r\n samaritans among you pray for her, and for others like her (whom we may no=\r\nt know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. And let us be careful in ou=\r\nr sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this is =\r\nwhy the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say &quot;let me be =\r\nyour instrument&quot; and leave the kundalini\n rising bit to God&#39;s will. Om Dum =\r\nDurgayai Namaha Aparna &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/=\r\nblockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; \n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n    &lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#f=\r\nff;height:0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n        \n  \n  \n    &lt;table style=3D&quot;margin-top:20px;ma=\r\nrgin-bottom:10px;&quot; cellspacing=3D&quot;4px&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;tbody&gt;\n        &lt;tr&gt;\n        =\r\n  &lt;td style=3D&quot;font-size:12px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:7p=\r\nx 5px 5px;color:#FFF;background-color:#F2F2F2;border:1px solid #EAEAEA;&quot;&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=3D&quot;font-size:12px;font-family:arial;padding:7px 5px 5px;co=\r\nlor:#FFF;background-color:#F2F2F2;border:1px solid #EAEAEA;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;font-size:12px;font-family:arial;padding:7px 5px 5px;color:#FFF;bac=\r\nkground-color:#F2F2F2;border:1px solid #EAEAEA;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=3D&quot;font=\r\n-size:12px;font-family:arial;padding:7px 5px 5px;color:#FFF;background-colo=\r\nr:#F2F2F2;border:1px solid #EAEAEA;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=3D&quot;font-size:12px;f=\r\nont-family:arial;padding:7px 5px 5px;color:#2D50FD;background-color:#F2F2F2=\r\n;border:1px solid #EAEAEA;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/di=\r\nv&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--1287737115-478378613-1362239795=:81871--\r\n\n"}}
