However, one&#39;s dharma towards various \npeople and objects can pull one in different directions. One has to balance \none&#39;s dharma towards various people and objects and make the right decision. \nAny action taken now with a self-identification with the action (i.e. mind \nthinking &quot;I am doing it&quot;) becomes a karma for future and will give its \nfruits (good or bad) in future.\n\nThough we are not the body, we temporarily live in a body for a few decades. \nThis body is like a house we live in and its sense organs (eyes, ears etc) \nare like windows in the house. When we live in a house, we have the \nresponsibility to take care of it and keep the house and its surroundings \nnice. Similarly, we have some duty to make the body happy. Give it food, \nwater etc, nourish it well, take good care of it, make sure it is healthy, \nmake sure its pleasures are taken care of and make sure it is gratified.\n\nHowever, we also have duties to other people, like parents, elders, \nrelatives, friends etc. In addition, there may be persons with strong debts \nwith us who come into our life later. We have duties towards them. Moreover, \nwe have some duties towards the society we live in, the country we live in \nand the entire universe.\n\nThese various duties can pull one in different directions. One has to \nbalance them all and do the best possible action. Arjuna&#39;s duty towards his \nguru Drona was to respect him and obey him. But his duty to his brother (and \nalso to the universe) required him to kill his guru who was on Duryodhana&#39;s \nside.\n\nUsually, one&#39;s duty towards one&#39;s own body and its gratification is a very \nsmall part of one&#39;s dharma and one&#39;s duty towards others should receive a \nhigher priority. The larger the number of people impacted, the higher the \nweightage.\n\nIf one&#39;s only motivation for doing something that would hurt many people is \nself-gratification, one is on a shaky basis. With such self-centered \nactions, one is likely to create far more new karmas than the old karmas one \nis getting rid of. Of course, if not hurting others now leads to something \nelse later that will hurt all those people even more, then that is worse. A \nlot depends on one&#39;s self-control. Choosing the lesser evil is a difficult \nexercise when one of the evils is not visible yet...\n\nNobody can make the right decision for you. You are responsible for your \nactions and will face the reactions to those actions later. For example, if \nyou have a debt to this girl and escape it now by calling off the marriage \nfor looks, you will have to pay it back later with interest. For example, \nyou may be born with terrible looks and many may reject you. Or the girl may \nbe born with more undesirable qualities and yet you may have to marry her. \nSo many possibilities are there and one cannot know for sure what is in \nstore.\n\nWhatever you decide, good luck to that girl, to your elders and also to you!\n\nBTW, this forum is for spiritual discussions and matters related to \nspiritual sadhana. Your request is only marginally related. This kind of \ndiscussions can derail the forum from its primary purpose. So I request \nmembers to show some discretion.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;rajeshhebbar2009&quot; &lt;rajeshhebbar2009@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, May 13, 2009 2:09 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Dharma or Choice?\n\n\n&gt; Is Dharma the right thing to follow or personal choice?\n&gt;\n&gt; My marriage is fixed with a girl who I said &#39;yes&#39; but currently feel is \n&gt; not good looking enough.
