Translations available today \ngive only the literal meanings and not of much use.\n\nOne can try reading &quot;Secret of the Veda&quot; by Swami Aurobindo. It does not \ngive a translation of the entire Vedic text and covers only a few selected \nverses. However, it is the most in-depth treatment I have ever come across. \nIt is definitely the work of a reborn rishi. I have no doubt.\n\nYou take any Vedic verse, learn the correct chanting and keep chanting it \nmentally. You may start out with a limited/flawed understanding of what it \nmeans, but eventually it may reveal itself to you more fully. Vedic verses \nhave that ability.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nHomam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;rohinipurang&quot; &lt;rohinipurang@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, February 26, 2007 12:27 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Women reading Vedas (Re: reading/learning the veda)\n\n\n&gt; Thank you Narasimha\n&gt;\n&gt; Your &#39;rambling&#39; was indeed very interesting and enlightening, esp abt\n&gt; the stree sharira.

Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; We are living in Kali yuga and Kali is becoming deeper. We cannot\n&gt; trust that\n&gt;&gt; every standard convention is based on sound knowledge.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; One of my favorite sooktas is &quot;Devi Sooktam&quot; from Rigveda. It is\n&gt; attributed\n&gt;&gt; to Vagambhrani, a female rishi. She felt oneness with the Divine\n&gt; Mother in\n&gt;&gt; Her undivided supreme form (nearly nirguna form) and the riks of\n&gt; Devi\n&gt;&gt; sooktam were revealed to her then. Those eight riks are really\n&gt; fantastic.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There are other riks in Rigveda that were revealed to the world by\n&gt; female\n&gt;&gt; rishis. We use those riks in our worship, meditation, homas and\n&gt; other\n&gt;&gt; sadhanas. Yet, should we insist that women cannot recite Veda? If\n&gt;&gt; Vagambhrani is amid us again as a woman, should we stop her from\n&gt; reciting\n&gt;&gt; Devi sooktam?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Jnaneshwar (or Jnanadev) was a great saint from Maharashtra from\n&gt; about 800\n&gt;&gt; years back. He was a great devotee of Krishna and was a fully self-\n&gt; realized\n&gt;&gt; master at a young age. He reformed religion and corrected some\n&gt; corrupt\n&gt;&gt; traditions. He once made a buffalo chant Veda.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He started to recite Veda and the head of the Brahmin council\n&gt; forbade him\n&gt;&gt; because he was not &quot;qualified&quot; to recite Veda. Jnaneshwar insisted\n&gt; that\n&gt;&gt; everyone had a right to recite Veda and the head of the council\n&gt; disagreed.\n&gt;&gt; As he started reciting Veda, the Brahmins tried to stop him by\n&gt; closing his\n&gt;&gt; mouth. Then a buffalo standing next to him took over and chanted\n&gt; Veda.\n&gt;&gt; Astounded by the miracle, the Brahmins fell at his feet. The head\n&gt; apologized\n&gt;&gt; and said, &quot;we are masquerading as the keepers of Veda, but you have\n&gt; the real\n&gt;&gt; understanding and mastery of Veda&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Jnaneshwar taught the equality of all and did not distinguish\n&gt; between people\n&gt;&gt; based on caste, creed or gender. He considered BhagavadGita as the\n&gt; essence\n&gt;&gt; of Veda and wrote a fantastic commentary on it. His commentary\n&gt; departs from\n&gt;&gt; the standard Dwaitic (dualistic) point of view adopted by most\n&gt; Vaishnava\n&gt;&gt; gurus and uses a purely Adwaitic (non-dualistic) point of view. It\n&gt; is a\n&gt;&gt; priceless and timeless masterpiece.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; One Swamiji who was at my house last month had an interesting take.\n&gt; He said\n&gt;&gt; that the belief that women cannot recite Vedas is based on a\n&gt;&gt; misinterpretation. He said that the physical body we have is called\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &quot;stree sareera&quot; and the inner body we have is called the &quot;purusha\n&gt; sareera&quot;.\n&gt;&gt; He said that the physical body comes from mother and the soul comes\n&gt; from\n&gt;&gt; father and that is why they are called so. The soul or inner self\n&gt; is the\n&gt;&gt; thousand-headed purusha within us (described in purusha sooktam).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He said that Veda is supposed to be recited with the purusha\n&gt; sareera.\n&gt;&gt; According to him, it does not mean that women cannot read it.\n&gt; Whether men or\n&gt;&gt; women, they have to read it with the purusha sareera, i.e. inner\n&gt; body, and\n&gt;&gt; not just with the physical body. So, according to him, the standard\n&gt;&gt; convention is based on a flawed understanding. According to him,\n&gt; one simply\n&gt;&gt; reciting Veda with the mouth without the correct internal\n&gt; understanding is\n&gt;&gt; only reading with the &quot;stree sareera&quot; and hence not doing the right\n&gt; thing.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In fact, reciting Veda and chanting the verses is one thing and\n&gt;&gt; understanding them is quite another. When we make sound, there are\n&gt; four\n&gt;&gt; levels of it - vaikhari, madhyama, pasyanti and para. Vibration of\n&gt; material\n&gt;&gt; belonging to the gross body (sthoola sareera) produces vaikhari\n&gt; level of\n&gt;&gt; sound and it is heard through the senses belonging to the gross\n&gt; body (ears).\n&gt;&gt; But vibrations at the level of subtle body (sookshma sareera) and\n&gt; vibrations\n&gt;&gt; at the level of astral body (kaarana sareera) are also there and\n&gt; can be\n&gt;&gt; perceived thorough subtle perception.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If one is chanting &quot;Om Namo Narayanaya&quot; and thinking of some\n&gt; mundane\n&gt;&gt; matters, the vibrations produced at levels above vaikhari will not\n&gt; be\n&gt;&gt; auspicious. There is so much stress on what we do physically and\n&gt; people\n&gt;&gt; forget that what happens at the other layers of existence is\n&gt; equally, if not\n&gt;&gt; more, important!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you produce the correct vibrations at all levels (not just\n&gt; physical)\n&gt;&gt; while &quot;reciting&quot; any Vedic mantra, you can truly &quot;experience&quot; the\n&gt; mantra. A\n&gt;&gt; full experience of a single Vedic mantra may be sufficient to alter\n&gt; one&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; life! The mantras of Veda are most powerful. Unfortunately, so much\n&gt; of Vedic\n&gt;&gt; scholarship these days is only superficial (but it has to be\n&gt; encouraged,\n&gt;&gt; because it will keep atleast one level of knowledge alive).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Forget the man vs woman controversy. The difference between genders\n&gt; is only\n&gt;&gt; in the gross body. When you go to the subtle body and astral body,\n&gt; there is\n&gt;&gt; no difference at all. One should realize that the role of gross\n&gt; body is too\n&gt;&gt; limited in the correct recitation/experience of a Vedic mantra. It\n&gt; is the\n&gt;&gt; purity of the subtle body and the lightness of the astral body that\n&gt; are far\n&gt;&gt; more important.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To be fair and balanced, I need to throw light on the other angle.\n&gt; Like I\n&gt;&gt; said, Vedic mantras are too powerful. They are capable of producing\n&gt; a full\n&gt;&gt; self-realization (actually the sole purpose of Veda is &quot;to know\n&gt; self&quot;).\n&gt;&gt; However, given the depth of Kali Yuga, it is difficult for it to\n&gt; come in one\n&gt;&gt; shot. It comes in steps. When one is half way down the path, one\n&gt; has to be\n&gt;&gt; careful and under the vigilant guidance of a sadguru.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When one is not fully realized and the gross body has a role to\n&gt; play, there\n&gt;&gt; are some differences based on the gender that come into play.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If a lady carrying a baby in her womb has certain spiritual\n&gt; experiences\n&gt;&gt; (which a good Vedic chanting is capable of bringing), there can\n&gt; even be an\n&gt;&gt; abortion (or a great siddha being born, on the other extreme).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There is another subtle factor. Good Vedic chanting can bring an\n&gt; awakening\n&gt;&gt; of Kundalini (i.e. an awakening of self-awareness) and an ascent of\n&gt;&gt; Kundalini (i.e. an ascent of self-awareness). Though some people\n&gt; may have a\n&gt;&gt; wrong impression about Kundalini because of the corrupt practices\n&gt; of a\n&gt;&gt; section of so-called &quot;Kundalini sadhakas&quot;, the fact is that\n&gt; Kundalini merely\n&gt;&gt; represents one&#39;s ego-consciousness. When one casually associates\n&gt; the body\n&gt;&gt; one sees with &quot;self&quot;, Kundalini is asleep in the Mooladhara chakra.\n&gt; As one&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; self-awareness becomes more and more refined, Kundalini ascends in\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; sookshma sareera. As one has a perfect self-realization, Kundalini\n&gt; reaches\n&gt;&gt; Sahasrara. Whether one thinks in these terms or not, Kundalini\n&gt; moves based\n&gt;&gt; on how evolved one is. Whether one is into Bhakti yoga or Raja yoga\n&gt; or Karma\n&gt;&gt; yoga or Jnana yoga does not matter. All paths lead to an awareness\n&gt; of a more\n&gt;&gt; and more correct concept of self as time progresses and a full\n&gt;&gt; self-realization finally. Accordingly, Kundalini rises more and\n&gt; more and\n&gt;&gt; reaches Sahasrara at the end.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; During the period when Kundalini is stuck in Swadhishthana chakra,\n&gt; sexual\n&gt;&gt; drive can multiply. Several yogis get stuck in this stage and fail\n&gt; the tests\n&gt;&gt; to progress further. In general, women have a higher drive than\n&gt; men. If that\n&gt;&gt; drive multiplies, there can be a difficult situation. However, it\n&gt; really\n&gt;&gt; depends on the individual and we cannot generalize.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thus, there are some practical difficulties on the way, which may\n&gt; have made\n&gt;&gt; some people come up with some rules. However, are those issues\n&gt; sufficient to\n&gt;&gt; ban women from reciting Veda? I don&#39;t think so. In fact, the\n&gt; factors I wrote\n&gt;&gt; above are probably irrelevant given the superficial understanding\n&gt; of Veda\n&gt;&gt; present at this time and the superficial recitation of Veda that we\n&gt; find\n&gt;&gt; these days.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But, if you want to be sure and do not want to misguide anyone, it\n&gt; is better\n&gt;&gt; to not give any advice. Leave it to one&#39;s sadguru. If you have a\n&gt; sadguru who\n&gt;&gt; is guiding your spiritual sadhana, surrender and do as your guru\n&gt; says! What\n&gt;&gt; is good for goose may not be good for gander. What goose&#39;s guru\n&gt; taught to\n&gt;&gt; goose may be good only for goose and not for gander. Gander will do\n&gt; well to\n&gt;&gt; follow gander&#39;s guru.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I think I rambled enough for today... :-)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Homam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;rohinipurang&quot; &lt;rohinipurang@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Saturday, February 24, 2007 12:18 PM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] reading/learning the veda\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;A warm namaste to everyone!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I have heard it said that women are not allowed to\n&gt; read/know/recite the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; vedas.
