Are you really this body?\n\n\n\nOne normally identifies w=\r\nith a body, a name and a limited identity that goes \n\nwith that body. This =\r\nidentification is very very strong.\n\n\n\nYou are actually Brahman, the all-pe=\r\nrvading, all-knowing and all-being \n\nessence of the universe. The same esse=\r\nnce manifests as various beings, \n\nincluding various deities and various pe=\r\nople, including your own body. And \n\n*you* really are that essence and not =\r\nthe body. Still you identify only with \n\nthe body.\n\n\n\nIt is possible to des=\r\ntroy this self identification with the body and \n\nidentify with another obj=\r\nect such as a deity. When you identify with a \n\ndeity, your consciousness i=\r\ns in communion with that of the deity. Your will, \n\nthoughts and actions ar=\r\ne those of the deity.\n\n\n\n*        *        *\n\n\n\n&gt; When somebody says me to =\r\nself identify with Shiva what exactly I have to \n\n&gt; do ?\n\n\n\nFirst I can tel=\r\nl you what exactly you have to avoid: Do NOT tell yourself \n\nthat you will =\r\nnow identify with Shiva, because Shiva is great and you want \n\nto be great.=\r\n In other words, this is not for ego satisfaction. In fact, \n\nuntil ego com=\r\npletely goes, it is not even possible.\n\n\n\nBefore you can self-identify with=\r\n any deity, first your false \n\nself-identification with body has to cease. =\r\nYou should absolutely not think \n\nof your body as &quot;I&quot;.\n\n\n\nYour will, though=\r\nts and actions should be those of Shiva.\n\n\n\nWill Shiva think of a specific =\r\nphysical body as &quot;I&quot;? No. If a specific \n\nphysical body has good or bad thi=\r\nngs happening to it, will Shiva feel \n\npleasure or pain? No. If people are =\r\npraising a specific person, will Shiva \n\nfeel proud? No. If people are atta=\r\ncking and criticizing a specific person, \n\nwill Shiva feel angry? No.\n\n\n\nTh=\r\ne first step is to overcome attachment to the body, name etc. Reach a \n\nsta=\r\nte where you are not very sensitive to pleasure and pain to the body and \n\n=\r\npraise and criticism of your thoughts and actions by other people. Reach a =\r\n\n\nstate where equanimity of mind can be maintained in all circumstances.\n\n\n=\r\n\nWHEN you reach that state, meditate with a mantra of Shiva while thinking =\r\nof \n\nShiva.\n\n\n\n*        *        *\n\n\n\nRamakrishna Paramahamsa could self-id=\r\nentify with not only deities, but \n\npretty much any object of the universe.=\r\n Once he went into deep meditation \n\nwhile admiring the beauty of grass in =\r\nthe lawn with dew on it.
