Is it fine if i do tarpan daily with sesame seeds, overlooking the da=\r\nys when its not supposed to be done? \nmy reasoning is that the days when it=\r\n is supposed to be avoided will be very few in a year. I am not aware of si=\r\ngnificance of those days and wethere its a strict rule.\n\n\n2. In your TARPAN=\r\n manual you talked about\n&quot;Alternately, one can view this as an internal eve=\r\nnt of satisfying and releasing an internal kaarmik predisposition. Ultimate=\r\nly, it is the latter. However, one needs to externalize first and perform e=\r\nxternal rituals, while thinking of what it means internally.&quot;\n\nYou had writ=\r\nten about mental homam also, in case one is not able to engage in actual on=\r\ne. \n\na. Can one similary do a Tarpan mentally.\n\nb. poorahuti means complete=\r\n surrender and one has to &quot;actually feel it&quot;, tarpan means releasing an int=\r\nernal kaarmik predisposition. How/What does one &quot;actually feel&quot; while doing=\r\n this.\n\n\nregards\npriyank\n\n\n\n\n"}}
