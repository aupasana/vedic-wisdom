This is true that =\r\na superior energy is supervising our progress and that energy Teach us, Gui=\r\nde us, Test, Punish and reward us suitably to teach us new lessons. Just li=\r\nke a teacher in our schools do. But difference between our school teacher a=\r\nnd this Superior teacher is that latter can choose any method or any medium=\r\n to teach us. And His teachings and tests come when they are most needed an=\r\nd least expected.\n\nWhen I just started searching myself, like everyone else=\r\n I also had many questions. Whenever i was stuck somewhere, I was inclined =\r\nto open a specific book or come to this group. I found that the question in=\r\n my mind was already answered here by Narasimha Ji, or Utpal ji or Rajarshi=\r\n ji just few hours before I visited, or in the page of book I randomly open=\r\ned. This is not a unique experience. Many other members in this group had a=\r\nlready written and shared such personal experiences and I believe that this=\r\n happen to everyone. \n\nI think that Picture of Thakur ji was method to tell=\r\n you that He is always near you and supervising you. \n\nAfter I sent my last=\r\n mail I realised that answer to Bhubendra Ji&#39;s question of &quot;How to Decode?&quot;=\r\n is written in lines adapted from Tarapeeth Bhairav. Especially the last li=\r\nne.\n\nKind Regards\nAtul\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Dr. Neela Muk=\r\nherjee&quot; &lt;neelamukherjee@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I must mention a strange yet noble =\r\nexperience.\n&gt; Daily morning I pray (briefly) to Thakur Ramakrishna and Sara=\r\nda ma and\n&gt; Vivekanandaji amongst others but did not have any picrures/phot=\r\nographs of\n&gt; eitherThakur and Sarada ma.\n&gt; \n&gt; I kept wishing for such a pho=\r\ntograph on the wall of our home and one\n&gt; day suddenly in one of the local =\r\nshops I was presented with a calendar (I\n&gt; hadn&#39;t asked for any), which had=\r\n picture of the Thakur with Sarada ma\n&gt; blessed by ma Kali.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was stun=\r\nned and still think that it was a wish fulfilment by Thakur.\n&gt; Strange are =\r\nHis ways.\n&gt; Neela\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Sat, Oct 16, 2010 at 10:59 AM, Dr. A.

I was inclined to borrow it so I did. When I read it I felt\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; that I am\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;reading just another version of Aghora Volumes. Things =\r\nwritten in Aghora\n&gt; &gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;also mentioned in it (Obviously not the st=\r\nory line but the facts related\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;saadhna). While reading I was =\r\nsuddenly inclined to share about this in\n&gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;group so I am writ=\r\ning here. This book will be helpful for people who\n&gt; &gt; believe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that =\r\nLot of things are written in between the lines in Aghora and are\n&gt; &gt; unable=\r\n to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;understand that &#39;in between the line&#39; content may find it helpfu=\r\nl. This\n&gt; &gt; book may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;not add anything much if you have already under=\r\nstood that &#39;in between\n&gt; &gt; the line&#39;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;content but it will be helpful =\r\nif you are trying to do so. Some details\n&gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the book are as u=\r\nnder.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This Book is about Yogi Vamacharan who lived about th=\r\ne same time as\n&gt; &gt; RamaKrishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Paramansa lived. Book also mentioned =\r\nthat vamacharan met Telanga Swami\n&gt; &gt; and also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;describe meeting with=\r\n Telanga swami. A Granth was written by Shri Sushil\n&gt; &gt; Kumar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Vansho=\r\npadyay dedicated to Vamacharan which was published in 1954. This\n&gt; &gt; was\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;translated in Hindi by Shri Chhavinath Mishra in 2001\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nName: Tarapeeth Bhairav\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Publisher: Vaamdev Sangh, Shri Ramendranath=\r\n Basu, 8, Pramanik Ghaat\n&gt; &gt; Road,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Kaashipur, Kolkata. 700036.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With the grace of Maa Tara\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Atul\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
