Some of my questions are already answered in your post, but I have f=\r\new more that hopefully you may throw some light on:\n\n1.What is it exactly t=\r\nhat we want to preseve? Is it phyiscal in nature e.g. seminal fluid/sperm a=\r\ns a result of Brhamacharya? How does that affect the outcome with man w/ va=\r\nsectomy?  \n\n2. The end-product is a continious non-volunteery secretion of =\r\ngland(s), similar to Saliva being generated. Sperms continiously die within=\r\n 72 hrs or so and been replaced with new ones whether we want it or not. Wh=\r\nat is it we are preseving then? Is it something non-tangible (the thoughts,=\r\n the process?) that we want to preserve?\n\n3. What is the significance of Br=\r\nahmarshi Shukracharya being one-eyed and having one daughter (devyani?)?\n\n3=\r\n. Is there a corelation between Brahmarshi Shukracharya owning Maha Mrityun=\r\njaya Mantra and Brahmacharya?\n\nAs usual your revoulutionary , relevant , to=\r\n-the-point and out-of-box thinking is shreshtha among men! Your explainatio=\r\nns and parables are simply exemplary! I thank you for your efforts!\n\nRegard=\r\ns\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Biswajit,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Good luck with homam. Others answered your ques=\r\ntions and I will leave them. But I want to say a few words on (3) as the re=\r\ncent discussion on aghora seems to have created some confusion. It is very =\r\neasy to misunderstand when we are communicating verbally, because one&#39;s own=\r\n mental conditioning has a role in deciding how one interprets words, sente=\r\nnces and their sub-text. It is more so when we are talking about delicate m=\r\natters.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; 3. When the talking of &quot;AGHORA&quot; g=\r\noing on, is it really needed\n&gt; &gt; to perform &quot;Bramhachariya&quot; for daily ganap=\r\nati homam?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Brahmacharya is very important in any spiritual sadhana. P=\r\neriod. As Narayan said, sexual activity results in loss of ojas (subtle vit=\r\nality) and wastes a part of one&#39;s creative essence. Doing sadhana without b=\r\nrahmacharya is like filling a water pot that is leaking through a hole. Eve=\r\nn if you succeed in filling the pot with water, it will soon become empty!\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; Just as a filled water pot that is leaking may still satisfy the thir=\r\nst of someone who takes a glass of water from it, similarly a person doing =\r\nsadhana without brahmacharya may sometimes be able to do his dharma and ser=\r\nve his purpose in the world. So, it is a good idea to do sadhana even as on=\r\ne&#39;s brahmacharya is not good yet. But, the best will be if the filled water=\r\n pot is not leaking and holds all the water. Similarly, a sadhaka who is ac=\r\ncumulating some shakti through sadhana and does not leak that energy throug=\r\nh acts of lust, anger, greed, jealosy etc will be able to serve dharma bett=\r\ner.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If there are 12 people who maintain physical and mental brahmacha=\r\nrya for a few years while doing homam everyday, I think the world can be ch=\r\nanged.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; If an aghora sits naked with partner=\r\n and chants mantra, please remember that the goal isn&#39;t having sex. This pr=\r\nactice is by means a glorification of sex. The goal is to *resist*. Even if=\r\n the mind is overwhelmed in the beginning with thrill and one ends up havin=\r\ng sex, the goal is to reach a stage where mind is not looking at nakedness =\r\nor intimacy as something to be excited about. The goal is to reach a stage =\r\nwhere brahmacharya can be maintained despite such provocation.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In fac=\r\nt, the true meaning of brahmacharya is not only to refrain from physical se=\r\nx but also to refrain from sexual thoughts in the mind. Many married people=\r\n of today may be able to set time limits (e.g. 40 days, 100 days, 1 year et=\r\nc) and maintain physical brahmacharya for that time, but it may be difficul=\r\nt to refrain from mental thoughts.\n&gt;  \n&gt; An aghora tries to incinerate the =\r\nroot cause of those thoughts in his mind (what Manish called as &quot;sampradaah=\r\na&quot;). Mind considers some things as pure and some things as impure. The &quot;imp=\r\nure&quot; objects and circumstances are considered impure because they cause thr=\r\nill or some other disturbance to the mind and waver it from god. But an agh=\r\nora puts them right in the middle of a &quot;pure&quot; activity (e.g. meditation), f=\r\norcing oneself to deal with them. After some time, the impure objects do no=\r\nt cause any thrill or other disturbance to waver the mind from god. Then th=\r\ney are no longer impure! For example, what is impure about a naked body? Th=\r\ne only thing impure about it is that it arouses certain thoughts in mind th=\r\nat disturb the mind and waver it from god. If a naked body no longer arouse=\r\ns such thoughts, what is impure about it?\n&gt;  \n&gt; That is the basic thinking =\r\nin this practice. Some yogis may physically abstain from sex and even stay =\r\naway from exposure to opposite sex, for several decades. But, if such a per=\r\nson is placed in front of a naked beauty, what thoughts will go on his mind=\r\n? For all you know, his mind may indeed be disturbed and waver from god. An=\r\n aghora tries to incinerate the very notion in the mind that so and so thin=\r\ng is something to be aroused by, not by staying away from it but by being w=\r\nith it and yet trying to focus the mind on god.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bottomline: An aghora=\r\n engaging in this practice may stray from brahmacharya in the beginning, bu=\r\nt the goal is to attain more perfect brahmacharya later on. The goal of thi=\r\ns practice is to attain brahmacharya.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If one does not keep brahmachar=\r\nya in the beginning of sadhana, it may be ok. But, to really start progress=\r\ning, one needs to somehow or the other attain some level of brahmacharya an=\r\nd keep perfecting it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; The coarse meaning of=\r\n brahmacharya is physical celibacy.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The finer meaning of brahmacharya=\r\n is physical celibacy and refraining from any sexual thoughts even in the m=\r\nind.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The finest meaning of brahmacharya is refraining from lust, ange=\r\nr, greed, delusion, wantonness and jealosy and establishing mind in Brahman=\r\n always. Brahmacharya literally means &quot;engaging in Brahman or Self&quot;. One ex=\r\nperiences lust, anger, greed, jealosy etc only when one&#39;s mind perceives an=\r\nd engages with impermanent manifestations of Self (e.g. a beautiful lady, a=\r\n bad person, a lot of money, a person being appreciated more than me etc) a=\r\nnd NOT when one&#39;s mind engages in true Self. Thus the truest brahmacharya c=\r\nomes only on Self-realization. But one can start with physical celibacy and=\r\n control over anger.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Rome is not built in a day.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bottomline: It=\r\n is very important to keep brahmacharya, even using the coarse meaning abov=\r\ne. Start off with some level of brahmacharya and try to improve it as time =\r\ngoes on. Never be frustrated with lack of progress and keep trying.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *=\r\n        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; BTW, regarding (4), even after fire goes away, you=\r\n can meditate. Fire will be burning in the ember form for a long time. So A=\r\ngni is still there consuming your offerings, even after it seems like there=\r\n is no fire.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Keep it as cheap as you can, based on your financial lev=\r\nel. Little ghee, fallen wood sticks collected manually and some sesame seed=\r\ns may be all you need.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software=\r\n, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals=\r\n for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAst=\r\nrologer.org\n&gt;      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n=\r\n&gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish=\r\n writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ----------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- biswa108 &lt;bi=\r\nswa1975@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; NAMASKAR to all\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have been performing Ga=\r\nnapati Homama for the last three weeks, credit goes to all of my seniors/me=\r\nmbers and Gurus of this beautiful forum...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now I need some practic=\r\nal approach best suitable for me...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1.
