There should be about 700 offerings in saptashati like =\r\nthis.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In addition, outside of the 700 offerings, there are things =\r\nlike kavacham, argala, keelakam, raatri sooktam and devi sooktam. In kavach=\r\nam, no offerings are made. In argala and keelakam, only ghee is offered by =\r\nadding swaahaa after each verse. I suggested reading raatri sooktam and dev=\r\ni sooktam without swaahaa, because adding swaahaa at the end of a Vedic ver=\r\nse with intonation is tricky. The swaahaa may require a modifcation in the =\r\nintonation or even the anuswara of the last syllable of the Vedic verse to =\r\nwhich you add swaahaa. That is why I suggested reading raatri sooktam and d=\r\nevi sooktam without swaahaa.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For the 700 verses of saptashati, the=\r\nre is no issue in adding swaahaa.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; Free J=\r\nyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yoursel=\r\nf&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish =\r\nwritings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; &gt; ------------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---- Anup Ray=\r\n &lt;aray_usa@yahoo. com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Ravi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for =\r\nyour response. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I guess Narasimhaji advised on not using swaha inappr=\r\nopriately if we are not well-versed in Sanskrit language.
