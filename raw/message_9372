In my view, it&#39;s good to d=\r\no at least 15-30 min sitting up if possible/one feels energetic, because va=\r\nrious teachers say, the energies in the body flow better that way. I don&#39;t =\r\nalways manage to finish the malas of japa during the daytime, and at night,=\r\n if there are a couple left and I&#39;m very tired, I do them lying down. May b=\r\ne you could do some rounds lying down and some sitting up, to slowly develo=\r\np the ability to do japa sitting up. The feeling and concentration is what =\r\nultimately counts they say....so if you have these while doing japa lying d=\r\nown, I don&#39;t think those rounds would be &#39;wasted&#39;, they would surely produc=\r\ne a good effect on your mind.  \n\nGood luck with your sadhana.\n\n\n--- In vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;sillylallypally&quot; &lt;sillylallypally@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Sirs, those of you experienced in Mantra Sadhana kindly reply \n&gt; to this.=\r\n Is it ok if I do mantra japa lying on bed comfortably? Or \n&gt; should it alw=\r\nays be in a a seated positon? Because, lying on \n&gt; bed comfortably, I can d=\r\no far more number of rounds than \n&gt; sitting up. Also, I can concentrate ent=\r\nirely on mantra being \n&gt; chanted that way. Also I read somewhere Anga nyasa=\r\n, Kara \n&gt; nyasa etc.are not necessary, just chanting the specified \n&gt; mantr=\r\na is adequate. What&#39;s your opinion on this?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
