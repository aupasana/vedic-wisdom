But, if it \ndoes, don&#39;t worry. Re-ignite it as Narayan said, pra=\r\ny to Agni in the \nmind and continue.\n&gt; \n&gt; Suppose a servant is asked by his=\r\n master to carry a vessel of milk \nto a place without spilling it on the wa=\r\ny. Suppose a little milk is \nspilled on the way. What should he do? Should =\r\nhe abandon the project \nor atleast carry the remaining milk to the destinat=\r\nion?\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; As Narayan said, fire going away can signal the bhutag=\r\nni being weak.\n&gt; \n&gt; But, one is better off ignoring those things and not th=\r\ninking too \nmuch about the significance.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; I recommend doing =\r\nhomam without worrying about how well or badly it \nwent and what results it=\r\n brought. Let me give an analogy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Think of your favorite deity as the =\r\nmaster and yourself as a \nservant. A servant simply serves the master. Simi=\r\nlarly, all the \nsadhana you do and your other activities are your way to se=\r\nrve your \nmaster.\n&gt; \n&gt; A rich landlord may be very wealthy and have many bi=\r\ng checks \neveryday to cash and also many big checks everyday to mail others=\r\n. \nYet, he may need a servant to physically carry papers to the bank and \nd=\r\no the needful. Similarly, god is capable of doing anything in this \nworld a=\r\nnd yet god needs human beings who execute god&#39;s agenda in this \nworld. That=\r\n is why various gods (including Vishnu himself) and \nvarious rishis keep co=\r\nming back to earth every now and then. The \nsupreme god of this world opera=\r\ntes through various physical persons \npresent on earth.\n&gt; \n&gt; We do homam an=\r\nd other spiritual sadhana, purify ourselves and try \nto help others, becaus=\r\ne that is god&#39;s work. Just as a servant carries \nmaster&#39;s papers to the ban=\r\nk, we do such work for god.\n&gt; \n&gt; Doing what is applauded by others as good =\r\nwork tends to promote ego \nand we need to guard against it. A servant carry=\r\ning a million dollar \ncheck to the bank and cashing it is NOT superior to a=\r\n servant \ncarrying a $100 check to the bank and cashing it. Both are merely=\r\n \ndoing their master&#39;s work and do not own anything. Both are just \n*instru=\r\nments* used by the master to carry out his agenda. Similarly, \none who does=\r\n what are considered great deeds in this world and one \nwho does what are c=\r\nonsidered meagre deeds in this world are both \nservants of god helping god =\r\nexecute god&#39;s agenda in this world. \nNeither really owns anything. One may =\r\nconsider oneself superior to \nthe other because his/her deeds are considere=\r\nd superior by the world, \nbut he/she is just as foolish as a servant who co=\r\nnsiders \nhimself/herself superior to another servant carrying something les=\r\ns \nvaluable.\n&gt; \n&gt; If this attitude of being a servant of god fully penetrat=\r\nes one&#39;s \nattitude, thinking and instincts, one is safe no matter what \nsit=\r\nuations his previous karmas place one in. One can remain happy and \nblissfu=\r\nl in pleasure and pain, in praise and criticism and in light \nand darkness.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Have the same attitude towards your sadhana like homam. It is a job \n=\r\nyou are doing for god. You do the best you can. But you own nothing. \nYou a=\r\nre doing it for god.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://w=\r\nww.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ =\r\ngroup/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.c=\r\nomcast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.=\r\norg\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; --=\r\n---------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- =\r\nOriginal Message ----- \n&gt; From: rajarshi nandy \n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogr=\r\noups. com \n&gt; Sent: Thursday, December 04, 2008 12:47 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [ved=\r\nic-wisdom] Regarding Maha Ganapati Homam\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Narasimhaji\n&gt; \n&gt; Reading=\r\n your response another question came into my mind. \nYou said:\n&gt; \n&gt; It is no=\r\nt good if fire is extinguished by rain in the \nmiddle of a homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is i=\r\nt not good that the fire gets extinguished by rain, or \nthe fact that the f=\r\nire is getting extinguished?\n&gt; \n&gt; I mean actyually i feel when someone star=\r\nts doing homa \nregularly, there can be instances when the homa agni gets \ne=\r\nxtinguished while the homa is still on..happened with me couple of \ntimes..=\r\n. i seriously dont knbow what to make of it but as one member \nin this list=\r\n had suggested to me, i relight the fire and keep \ncontinuing with the homa=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is =\r\nBhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Thu, 4/12/08, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@=\r\n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wi=\r\nsdom] Regarding Maha Ganapati Homam\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; =\r\nCc: &quot;Phanikumar Velaga&quot; &lt;itsverysimple@ ...&gt;\n&gt; Date: Thursday, 4 December, =\r\n2008, 6:48 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste Phani,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the=\r\n roof top of a house(3-\nfloors) ? Can a homam\n&gt; &gt; kundam made by arranging =\r\nred bricks, with sand base be \nused instead of a\n&gt; &gt; copper one?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, =\r\nyou can do it on a rooftop. Doing it in the open is \nactually better than d=\r\noing it in closed space. But realize that a \nrain can cause problems. Keep =\r\nan umbrella around to protect the fire \nif it rains while you are doing hom=\r\nam. It is not good if fire is \nextinguished by rain in the middle of a homa=\r\nm.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, you can construct a homa kundam with bricks and sand \nat the b=\r\nottom. Use a square shaped huma kunda.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2)While performing the Homam =\r\nusing the mp3 audio file, \nshould one repeat the\n&gt; &gt; mantras mentally along=\r\n with the audio?\n&gt; \n&gt; One can repeat mentally while listening attentively (=\r\nnot \ncasually). Actually, even listening to mantras with all the attention =\r\n\nfocused is as powerful as saying mantras.\n&gt; \n&gt; Suppose person X is chantin=\r\ng a mantra and thinking of \nsome mundane matter in the mind. Suppose person=\r\n Y is listening to it \nwith focus and thinking of the mantra and its deity.=\r\n Then the mantra \nmay do nothing for person X and yet person Y may benefit =\r\nfrom the \nmantra. The word mantra means &quot;one that protects the mind&quot;.. One =\r\ncan \nsay a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be protected. The key is \ncontr=\r\nol over the mind and keeping the mind focused on the mantra.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, =\r\nthere is a difference between meditation and \nhomam. Mantra is submitted in=\r\n the internal fire in meditation and it \nis submitted in the external fire =\r\nas well in a homam. So making some \nexternal sound (even if feeble) is a go=\r\nod idea as opposed to silent \nchanting or just listening. Try to repeat slo=\r\nwly.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Other \nconditions/n=\r\niyamas that\n&gt; &gt; should be followed apart from having vegeterain food?\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nYes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread ceremony) \nhas been performed =\r\ncan do it. Bachelor or married is irrelevant.\n&gt; \n&gt; One should follow the ya=\r\nmas and niyamas set by one&#39;s \nguru. Whatever rules one&#39;s guru sets, one sho=\r\nuld follow them \nstrictly. At the minimum, one should eat only vegetarian f=\r\nood on the \nday of homam and take a bath before homam. Another rule I will =\r\n\nrecommend is to avoid eating any solid food 2 hours before homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; By =\r\nthe way, if one without a sacred thread wants to do \nhomam for spiritual pr=\r\nogress, I am willing to take responsibility and \nallow them to do it. Such =\r\na person can think of me or my guru as guru \nand perform homam. I am willin=\r\ng to take on any karma incurred in the \nprocess until the person crosses so=\r\nme minimum threshhold of purity \nthrough homam and other spiritual practice=\r\ns. Sacred thread or no \nsacred thread, mantropadesa or no mantropadesa, it =\r\ndoes not matter \nafter a while, when the person crosses a threshhold of pur=\r\nity. The \ngoal of upanayanam and other mantropadesa by guru is to speed thi=\r\ns up \nand make the person cross the threshhold of purity.\n&gt; \n&gt; As long as o=\r\nne desires no specific material benefits (and \nready to receive whatever go=\r\nd gives) and does homam for spiritual \nprogress, I am willing to help, even=\r\n if it means some suffering for \nme.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4)Any good date to start the Ho=\r\nmam? or any day would be \nfine?\n&gt; \n&gt; For Mahaganapathi homam, the best is a=\r\n Chaturthi morning. \nBut any day is fine really.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Mentioning=\r\n rain and rooftop homam reminded me of my India \ntrip.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I went to =\r\nIndia in May 2008, I and my guru Manish \ntraveled together to several place=\r\ns (on a specific project). We ended \nup doing homam in the morning in sever=\r\nal places (wherever we were). \nBefore the trip, my guru told me to carry an=\r\n umbrella with me. As \nmonsoons come only in June/July in India, I did not =\r\ntake it \nseriously. We were in New Delhi in mid-May.. We proceeded to the \n=\r\nrooftop of the apartment complex we were in, to do a homam. Manish \ntold me=\r\n, &quot;Narasimha, it is going to rain heavily in this city after \nour homam fin=\r\nishes&quot;. I just smiled.\n&gt; \n&gt; To my surprise, it did rain as soon as our homa=\r\ns \nfinished. After we offered poornaahuti, it suddenly started raining \nwit=\r\nh really big drops. Luckily, there was a small towel/blanket on \nthe roofto=\r\np close to us. Together, we held it on top of the two small \nhoma kundas, c=\r\nlosed our eyes and meditated. We held the cloth cover \non the homa kundas u=\r\nntil fire in the two homa kundas went off and \nthen packed everything and w=\r\nent down. We left for Kurukshetra later \nthat day, but we were told that a =\r\nheavy rain continued for a few days \nin New Delhi. In fact, rain followed u=\r\ns on that trip as we covered \nthe north, east and west of India. It rained =\r\nin every place we went \nto, as we finished our task in that place and prepa=\r\nred to move on.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- -----\n---- -\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAst \nrologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.=\r\nVedicAst \nrologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ gr=\r\noup/vedic- \nwisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. \nhome..=\r\ncomcast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst \nrologe=\r\nr.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan \nnath..org\n=\r\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -----\n---- -\n&gt; \n&gt; --=\r\n-- Phanikumar Velaga &lt;itsverysimple@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Namasthe,\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; I am interested in doing Maha Ganapati Homam daily, and \nhave few quest=\r\nions\n&gt; &gt; regarding it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of=\r\n a house(3-\nfloors) ?

Let me give an analogy.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Think of your favorite deity as the master and yourself as a =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;servant. A servant simply serves the master. Similarly, all the &lt;BR&gt;sad=\r\nhana you do and your other activities are your way to serve your &lt;BR&gt;master=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; A rich landlord may be very wealthy and have many big ch=\r\necks &lt;BR&gt;everyday to cash and also many big checks everyday to mail others.=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;Yet, he may need a servant to physically carry papers to the bank and =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;do the needful. Similarly, god is capable of doing anything in this &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;world and yet god needs human beings who execute god&#39;s agenda in this &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nworld. That is why various gods (including Vishnu\n himself) and &lt;BR&gt;various=\r\n rishis keep coming back to earth every now and then. The &lt;BR&gt;supreme god o=\r\nf this world operates through various physical persons &lt;BR&gt;present on earth=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; We do homam and other spiritual sadhana, purify ourselve=\r\ns and try &lt;BR&gt;to help others, because that is god&#39;s work. Just as a servant=\r\n carries &lt;BR&gt;master&#39;s papers to the bank, we do such work for god.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Doing what is applauded by others as good work tends to promote eg=\r\no &lt;BR&gt;and we need to guard against it. A servant carrying a million dollar =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;check to the bank and cashing it is NOT superior to a servant &lt;BR&gt;carry=\r\ning a $100 check to the bank and cashing it. Both are merely &lt;BR&gt;doing thei=\r\nr master&#39;s work and do not own anything. Both are just &lt;BR&gt;*instruments* us=\r\ned by the master to carry out his agenda. Similarly, &lt;BR&gt;one who does what =\r\nare considered great deeds in this world and one &lt;BR&gt;who does what are cons=\r\nidered meagre deeds in this world are both\n &lt;BR&gt;servants of god helping god=\r\n execute god&#39;s agenda in this world. &lt;BR&gt;Neither really owns anything. One =\r\nmay consider oneself superior to &lt;BR&gt;the other because his/her deeds are co=\r\nnsidered superior by the world, &lt;BR&gt;but he/she is just as foolish as a serv=\r\nant who considers &lt;BR&gt;himself/herself superior to another servant carrying =\r\nsomething less &lt;BR&gt;valuable.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If this attitude of being a s=\r\nervant of god fully penetrates one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;attitude, thinking and instincts, =\r\none is safe no matter what &lt;BR&gt;situations his previous karmas place one in.=\r\n One can remain happy and &lt;BR&gt;blissful in pleasure and pain, in praise and =\r\ncriticism and in light &lt;BR&gt;and darkness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Have the same att=\r\nitude towards your sadhana like homam. It is a job &lt;BR&gt;you are doing for go=\r\nd. You do the best you can. But you own nothing. &lt;BR&gt;You are doing it for g=\r\nod.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ -=\r\n-------- --------- ---------\n --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homa=\r\nm Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blan=\r\nk rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do Pitr=\r\ni Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; tar=\r\nget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; =\r\ntarget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdo=\r\nm&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home=\r\n.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comca=\r\nst. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.=\r\nvedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst ro=\r\nloger.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http:/=\r\n/www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan =\r\nnath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- ---------\n --------- --------- =\r\n--------- - &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: r=\r\najarshi nandy &lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com=\r\n&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; Sent: Thursday, December 04, 2008 12:47 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wi=\r\nsdom] Regarding Maha Ganapati Homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear Narasimhaji&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Reading your response another question came into my mind. &lt;BR&gt;Y=\r\nou said:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; It is not good if fire is extinguished by rain in=\r\n the &lt;BR&gt;middle of a homam.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Is it not good that the fire g=\r\nets extinguished by rain, or &lt;BR&gt;the fact that the fire is getting extingui=\r\nshed?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I mean actyually i feel when someone starts doing ho=\r\nma &lt;BR&gt;regularly, there can be instances when the homa agni gets &lt;BR&gt;exting=\r\nuished while the homa is still on..happened with me couple of &lt;BR&gt;times... =\r\ni seriously dont knbow what to make of it but as one\n member &lt;BR&gt;in this li=\r\nst had suggested to me, i relight the fire and keep &lt;BR&gt;continuing with the=\r\n homa.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- On Thu, 4/12/08, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@.=\r\n..&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Regarding Maha Ganapati Homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: &lt;=\r\nA href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofo=\r\nllow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Cc: &quot;Phanikumar Velaga&quot; &lt=\r\n;itsverysimple@ ...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Date: Thursday, 4 December, 2008, 6:48 AM&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste Phani,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 1)Can Homam b=\r\ne performed on the roof top of a house(3-&lt;BR&gt;floors) ? Can a homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; kundam made by arranging red bricks, with sand base be &lt;BR&gt;used instea=\r\nd of a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; copper one?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n Yes, you can do it on a r=\r\nooftop. Doing it in the open is &lt;BR&gt;actually better than doing it in closed=\r\n space. But realize that a &lt;BR&gt;rain can cause problems. Keep an umbrella ar=\r\nound to protect the fire &lt;BR&gt;if it rains while you are doing homam. It is n=\r\not good if fire is &lt;BR&gt;extinguished by rain in the middle of a homam.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Yes, you can construct a homa kundam with bricks and sand &lt;BR&gt;a=\r\nt the bottom. Use a square shaped huma kunda.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 2)While=\r\n performing the Homam using the mp3 audio file, &lt;BR&gt;should one repeat the&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; mantras mentally along with the audio?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; One can=\r\n repeat mentally while listening attentively (not &lt;BR&gt;casually). Actually, =\r\neven listening to mantras with all the attention &lt;BR&gt;focused is as powerful=\r\n as saying mantras.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Suppose person X is chanting a mantra =\r\nand thinking of &lt;BR&gt;some mundane matter in the mind. Suppose person Y is li=\r\nstening to it &lt;BR&gt;with focus and thinking\n of the mantra and its deity. The=\r\nn the mantra &lt;BR&gt;may do nothing for person X and yet person Y may benefit f=\r\nrom the &lt;BR&gt;mantra. The word mantra means &quot;one that protects the mind&quot;.. On=\r\ne can &lt;BR&gt;say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be protected. The key is &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;control over the mind and keeping the mind focused on the mantra.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; However, there is a difference between meditation and &lt;BR&gt;homam.=\r\n Mantra is submitted in the internal fire in meditation and it &lt;BR&gt;is submi=\r\ntted in the external fire as well in a homam. So making some &lt;BR&gt;external s=\r\nound (even if feeble) is a good idea as opposed to silent &lt;BR&gt;chanting or j=\r\nust listening. Try to repeat slowly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 3)Can bachelors =\r\ndo Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Other &lt;BR&gt;conditions/niyamas that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nshould be followed apart from having vegeterain food?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Yes.=\r\n Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread ceremony) &lt;BR&gt;has been performed c=\r\nan do it. Bachelor or married is\n irrelevant.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; One should f=\r\nollow the yamas and niyamas set by one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;guru. Whatever rules one&#39;s gur=\r\nu sets, one should follow them &lt;BR&gt;strictly. At the minimum, one should eat=\r\n only vegetarian food on the &lt;BR&gt;day of homam and take a bath before homam.=\r\n Another rule I will &lt;BR&gt;recommend is to avoid eating any solid food 2 hour=\r\ns before homam.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; By the way, if one without a sacred thread=\r\n wants to do &lt;BR&gt;homam for spiritual progress, I am willing to take respons=\r\nibility and &lt;BR&gt;allow them to do it. Such a person can think of me or my gu=\r\nru as guru &lt;BR&gt;and perform homam. I am willing to take on any karma incurre=\r\nd in the &lt;BR&gt;process until the person crosses some minimum threshhold of pu=\r\nrity &lt;BR&gt;through homam and other spiritual practices. Sacred thread or no &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;sacred thread, mantropadesa or no mantropadesa, it does not matter &lt;BR&gt;a=\r\nfter a while, when the person crosses a threshhold of purity. The &lt;BR&gt;goal =\r\nof upanayanam and other\n mantropadesa by guru is to speed this up &lt;BR&gt;and m=\r\nake the person cross the threshhold of purity.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; As long as =\r\none desires no specific material benefits (and &lt;BR&gt;ready to receive whateve=\r\nr god gives) and does homam for spiritual &lt;BR&gt;progress, I am willing to hel=\r\np, even if it means some suffering for &lt;BR&gt;me.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 4)Any =\r\ngood date to start the Homam? or any day would be &lt;BR&gt;fine?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; For Mahaganapathi homam, the best is a Chaturthi morning. &lt;BR&gt;But any day=\r\n is fine really.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mentioning rain an=\r\nd rooftop homam reminded me of my India &lt;BR&gt;trip.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When I w=\r\nent to India in May 2008, I and my guru Manish &lt;BR&gt;traveled together to sev=\r\neral places (on a specific project). We ended &lt;BR&gt;up doing homam in the mor=\r\nning in several places (wherever we were). &lt;BR&gt;Before the trip, my guru tol=\r\nd me to carry an umbrella with me. As &lt;BR&gt;monsoons come only in June/July i=\r\nn India, I did\n not take it &lt;BR&gt;seriously. We were in New Delhi in mid-May.=\r\n. We proceeded to the &lt;BR&gt;rooftop of the apartment complex we were in, to d=\r\no a homam. Manish &lt;BR&gt;told me, &quot;Narasimha, it is going to rain heavily in t=\r\nhis city after &lt;BR&gt;our homam finishes&quot;. I just smiled.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; To =\r\nmy surprise, it did rain as soon as our homas &lt;BR&gt;finished. After we offere=\r\nd poornaahuti, it suddenly started raining &lt;BR&gt;with really big drops. Lucki=\r\nly, there was a small towel/blanket on &lt;BR&gt;the rooftop close to us. Togethe=\r\nr, we held it on top of the two small &lt;BR&gt;homa kundas, closed our eyes and =\r\nmeditated. We held the cloth cover &lt;BR&gt;on the homa kundas until fire in the=\r\n two homa kundas went off and &lt;BR&gt;then packed everything and went down. We =\r\nleft for Kurukshetra later &lt;BR&gt;that day, but we were told that a heavy rain=\r\n continued for a few days &lt;BR&gt;in New Delhi. In fact, rain followed us on th=\r\nat trip as we covered &lt;BR&gt;the north, east and west of India. It rained in e=\r\nvery\n place we went &lt;BR&gt;to, as we finished our task in that place and prepa=\r\nred to move on.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; --=\r\n---------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -----&lt;BR&gt;---- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank=\r\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;rologer.org/ homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do P=\r\nitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank re=\r\nl=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spiri=\r\ntuality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://=\r\ngroups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ group/vedic- &lt;BR&gt;wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons=\r\n (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http=\r\n://vedicastro.&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;home..comcast. net&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Wi=\r\nndows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;htt=\r\np://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) web=\r\nsite: &lt;A\n href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagan/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http=\r\n://www.SriJagan&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;nath..org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- =\r\n--------- --------- -----&lt;BR&gt;---- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---- Phanikumar Velaga=\r\n &lt;itsverysimple@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namasthe,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I am interested in doing Maha Ganapati Homam daily, and &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;have few questions&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; regarding it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of a house(3-&lt;BR&gt;floors) ?
