A common person gives =C3=82 a damn to the concept of liberation. Wh=\r\nen ever i =C3=82 have discussion with people in my office they think =C3=82=\r\n i am mad . How should one deal with that because i =C3=82 think that peopl=\r\ne =C3=82 who are unaware of this great concept should be taught with this i=\r\ndeaology.&gt;&gt;\n\nThis cannot be forced, this should not be forced. Yes there ar=\r\ne plenty of people who have no interest in these, so let them be. Someone l=\r\nikes spirituality, someone else likes something, someone else likes another=\r\n thing, its all fine. That is how it should be. I used to suffer from this =\r\ncompulsive habit of trying to force spiritual discussions on others, now th=\r\nankfully I am relatively cured. On our part, what we can do is not to fall =\r\nin the trap of thinking that because we are doing some sadhana, or have som=\r\ne interest in these things therefore we are anyway better. Not at all. Ther=\r\ne is beauty in diversity. I have seen rank atheists who have more detachmen=\r\nt and equanimity than many believers. If you want to discuss spirituality, =\r\nfind a group of friends with similar inclination and do so. But never try t=\r\no force it on an unwilling individual. Whenever force is applied, it invari=\r\nable leads to a unpredictable and at times unpleasant reaction at some late=\r\nr\n date. \n\nOne of the people whom I consider as one of my gurus, had told m=\r\ne once, &quot;Duniya banane wala duniya chalana bhi janta hai&quot; (One who made the=\r\n world also knows how to run the world). Now I believe that statement is ba=\r\nng on. Feel no pressure. Everything is in safe hands!\n\n&lt;&lt; 5. Why =C3=82 did=\r\n Gautam Buddha left his wife and his child and even then achieved the statu=\r\ns of God?&gt;&gt;\n\nIn my view, we use the term God too loosely. There are Mahatma=\r\ns, great Mahatmas, fantastic spiritual beings, and then there is God. Buddh=\r\na was a fantastic and super-duper spiritual being.\n\nNow coming to your ques=\r\ntion, there is no fixed rule of how and what can lead a man to liberation o=\r\nr higher states of spirituality. Frankly, there is no path which *guarantee=\r\ns* liberation. All paths have the potential, but realization is an individu=\r\nal&#39;s journey, and each such journey will not be a mirror of anyone else&#39;s j=\r\nourney. Broadly there may be similarities, but nuances will differ. For som=\r\ne it is necessary to leave their wife and children to be spiritual, for oth=\r\ners they may not need to do so. \n\nInfact, the aim of sadhana is to prepare =\r\nyourself. If and when you experience and realize God, it is going be God&#39;s =\r\nsweet will. Sadhana does not guarantee realization, but without sadhana it =\r\nis nearly impossibly, for you are simply not prepared enough to experience.=\r\n \n\n&lt;&lt;3. I was reading =C3=82 a newspaper that people after having darshan o=\r\nf Mata Vaishno Devi, Kedarnaath, etc =C3=82 , while returning, met with acc=\r\nident and died. Why does this happen? People have just come from a such a w=\r\nonderful darshan then why tragedy strikes them.&gt;&gt; \n\nThe idea of trying to f=\r\norce a cause effect relation to everything is an inherent tendency of the m=\r\nind. It is not necessarily how things are. Neither is it useful.\n\nIf a man =\r\nwants to only experience God, then every life-experience, apparently good o=\r\nr apparently bad, is only going to take your forward towards the goal if yo=\r\nu keep your aim fixed. No wonder Lord Krishna stresses so much on detachmen=\r\nt and equanimity in his advice to Arjuna, rather than trying to find out ca=\r\nuse-effect relationships of the apparently good or the apparently bad kinds=\r\n. \n\nSufferings are a great way of focusing on God. Really. Slowly but surel=\r\ny you realize that the world will run in its own pattern and you cannot do =\r\nmuch about it, except control what is in your power to control, that is you=\r\nr internal state. \n\nKrishna gives this advice to Arjuna in the Second Chapt=\r\ner: &quot;Dukhesva Anudhvigna-manah Sukhesu-Vigatasprhah Vita-Raga-Bhaya-Krodhah=\r\n Sthita-Dhira Munir Uchyate&quot; Gita 2:56 [Miseries do not agitate the mind, i=\r\nn sukha (fleeting happiness) there is no elation, such a one who is free fr=\r\nom attachment, fear and anger, is a sage of steady mind.]\n\nTough? Sure. But=\r\n no harm in making an effort. This is something to be tried on a regular ba=\r\nsis, day in and day out.\n\n&lt;&lt;2. Persons who do nothing =C3=82 in the field o=\r\nf spirituality can also meet God, higher saints. How is it possible?&gt;&gt;\n\nDep=\r\nends on what we understand by the term spirituality. Many have this notion =\r\nthat spirituality only means sitting and doing tough penances ETC. There is=\r\n more to spirituality than that. Essentially, it is a transformation of min=\r\nd, emotions and body (this bit is nearly impossible) into another state. \n\n=\r\nSadhana is needed to prepare the ground - mind/emotions/body. But *meeting =\r\nGod* (as you put it) depends on what you mean by God, and on God&#39;s sweet wi=\r\nll. Sometimes, living your daily life with an internal sense of surrender t=\r\no a Supreme, trying to inculcate equanimity in testing circumstances, tryin=\r\ng to stop the mind from automatically reacting to provocations, seeing othe=\r\nr people&#39;s point of views and thus becoming more objective, trying to be co=\r\nmpassionate (but not self-pity or pity in any form, for pity is a degenerat=\r\nive emotion, while compassion is uplifting) ETC are all sadhanas which can =\r\nbe done by anybody. One need not read complex scriptures, or believe in rel=\r\nigion to be able to do these. \n\n&lt;&lt;1. After effect of Homam can be negative =\r\nalso. Is it true?&gt;&gt;\n\nAfter effect of any sadhana can be negative (or positi=\r\nve), if your aim is anything materialistic. If your aim is purely spiritual=\r\n transformation, both so called negative and so called positive will help y=\r\nou. \n\n&lt;&lt;Fulfilling the duties of husband is a blockage in the spiritual pat=\r\nh.&gt;&gt;\n\nDharma is never a blockage. When the time is ripe, the Lord sets the =\r\npath. \n\nWhen Lord Krishna send Uddhava - who was a gyani of the first order=\r\n - to the Gopis, he was amazed to see that the Gopis would spend the whole =\r\nday doing whatever they must do, but they would perform every action, even =\r\nthe most mundane like clearing the garbage, with a small prayer in their li=\r\nps, &quot;Sri KrishNaaya Samarpayami..&quot;. \n\nPatience and surrender to God can be =\r\ninculcated, progressively, in any life situation. Infact, it is the ONLY th=\r\ning that you can work on. Rest, the world around apart from you, will follo=\r\nw its own rhythm which has been decided by actions performed in the past wh=\r\nich one may or maynot be aware of. \n\nEvery blockage is an opportunity to in=\r\ncrease the sense of surrender to something Higher, and that in turn acts as=\r\n a powerful internal catalyst for change.\n\nCaveat: These answers are based =\r\non my current perspective of things. They may not be sacrosanct. In future,=\r\n I myself may or may-not agree to these answers -:)\n\n-Regards\nRajarshi\n--- =\r\nIn vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, gaurav tripathi &lt;gaurav_alld@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Dear All Learned members,\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 =C3=82=C2=A0Following are my qu=\r\nestions:\n&gt; 1.

A common person gives =C3=82 a damn to the concept of liber=\r\nation. When ever i =C3=82 have discussion with people in my office they thi=\r\nnk =C3=82 i am mad . How should one deal with that because i =C3=82 think t=\r\nhat people =C3=82 who are unaware of this great concept should be taught wi=\r\nth this ideaology.&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThis cannot be forced, this should not =\r\nbe forced. Yes there are plenty of people who have no interest in these, so=\r\n let them be. Someone likes spirituality, someone else likes something, som=\r\neone else likes another thing, its all fine. That is how it should be. I us=\r\ned to suffer from this compulsive habit of trying to force spiritual discus=\r\nsions on others, now thankfully I am relatively cured. On our part, what we=\r\n can do is not to fall in the trap of thinking that because we are doing so=\r\nme sadhana, or have some interest in these things therefore we are anyway b=\r\netter. Not at all. There is beauty in diversity. I have seen rank atheists =\r\nwho have more detachment and equanimity than many believers. If you want to=\r\n discuss spirituality, find a group of friends with similar inclination and=\r\n do so. But never try to force it on an unwilling individual. Whenever forc=\r\ne is applied, it invariable leads to a unpredictable and at times unpleasan=\r\nt reaction at some later\n date. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOne of the people whom I consider=\r\n as one of my gurus, had told me once, &quot;Duniya banane wala duniya chalana b=\r\nhi janta hai&quot; (One who made the world also knows how to run the world). Now=\r\n I believe that statement is bang on. Feel no pressure. Everything is in sa=\r\nfe hands!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;&lt; 5. Why =C3=82 did Gautam Buddha left his wife a=\r\nnd his child and even then achieved the status of God?&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn =\r\nmy view, we use the term God too loosely. There are Mahatmas, great Mahatma=\r\ns, fantastic spiritual beings, and then there is God. Buddha was a fantasti=\r\nc and super-duper spiritual being.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nNow coming to your question, th=\r\nere is no fixed rule of how and what can lead a man to liberation or higher=\r\n states of spirituality. Frankly, there is no path which *guarantees* liber=\r\nation. All paths have the potential, but realization is an individual&#39;s jou=\r\nrney, and each such journey will not be a mirror of anyone else&#39;s journey. =\r\nBroadly there may be similarities, but nuances will differ. For some it is =\r\nnecessary to leave their wife and children to be spiritual, for others they=\r\n may not need to do so. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nInfact, the aim of sadhana is to prepare =\r\nyourself. If and when you experience and realize God, it is going be God&#39;s =\r\nsweet will. Sadhana does not guarantee realization, but without sadhana it =\r\nis nearly impossibly, for you are simply not prepared enough to experience.=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;&lt;3. I was reading =C3=82 a newspaper that people after ha=\r\nving darshan of Mata Vaishno Devi, Kedarnaath, etc =C3=82 , while returning=\r\n, met with accident and died. Why does this happen? People have just come f=\r\nrom a such a wonderful darshan then why tragedy strikes them.&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe idea of trying to force a cause effect relation to everything is a=\r\nn inherent tendency of the mind. It is not necessarily how things are. Neit=\r\nher is it useful.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf a man wants to only experience God, then ever=\r\ny life-experience, apparently good or apparently bad, is only going to take=\r\n your forward towards the goal if you keep your aim fixed. No wonder Lord K=\r\nrishna stresses so much on detachment and equanimity in his advice to Arjun=\r\na, rather than trying to find out cause-effect relationships of the apparen=\r\ntly good or the apparently bad kinds. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSufferings are a great way =\r\nof focusing on God. Really. Slowly but surely you realize that the world wi=\r\nll run in its own pattern and you cannot do much about it, except control w=\r\nhat is in your power to control, that is your internal state. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nKri=\r\nshna gives this advice to Arjuna in the Second Chapter: &quot;Dukhesva Anudhvign=\r\na-manah Sukhesu-Vigatasprhah Vita-Raga-Bhaya-Krodhah Sthita-Dhira Munir Uch=\r\nyate&quot; Gita 2:56 [Miseries do not agitate the mind, in sukha (fleeting happi=\r\nness) there is no elation, such a one who is free from attachment, fear and=\r\n anger, is a sage of steady mind.]&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTough? Sure. But no harm in mak=\r\ning an effort. This is something to be tried on a regular basis, day in and=\r\n day out.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;&lt;2. Persons who do nothing =C3=82 in the field of=\r\n spirituality can also meet God, higher saints. How is it possible?&gt;&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nDepends on what we understand by the term spirituality. Many have=\r\n this notion that spirituality only means sitting and doing tough penances =\r\nETC. There is more to spirituality than that. Essentially, it is a transfor=\r\nmation of mind, emotions and body (this bit is nearly impossible) into anot=\r\nher state. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSadhana is needed to prepare the ground - mind/emotion=\r\ns/body. But *meeting God* (as you put it) depends on what you mean by God, =\r\nand on God&#39;s sweet will. Sometimes, living your daily life with an internal=\r\n sense of surrender to a Supreme, trying to inculcate equanimity in testing=\r\n circumstances, trying to stop the mind from automatically reacting to prov=\r\nocations, seeing other people&#39;s point of views and thus becoming more objec=\r\ntive, trying to be compassionate (but not self-pity or pity in any form, fo=\r\nr pity is a degenerative emotion, while compassion is uplifting) ETC are al=\r\nl sadhanas which can be done by anybody. One need not read complex scriptur=\r\nes, or believe in religion to be able to do these. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;&lt;1. Aft=\r\ner effect of Homam can be negative also. Is it true?&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAfter=\r\n effect of any sadhana can be negative (or positive), if your aim is anythi=\r\nng materialistic. If your aim is purely spiritual transformation, both so c=\r\nalled negative and so called positive will help you. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;&lt;Fulf=\r\nilling the duties of husband is a blockage in the spiritual path.&gt;&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nDharma is never a blockage. When the time is ripe, the Lord sets th=\r\ne path. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWhen Lord Krishna send Uddhava - who was a gyani of the f=\r\nirst order - to the Gopis, he was amazed to see that the Gopis would spend =\r\nthe whole day doing whatever they must do, but they would perform every act=\r\nion, even the most mundane like clearing the garbage, with a small prayer i=\r\nn their lips, &quot;Sri KrishNaaya Samarpayami..&quot;. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPatience and surren=\r\nder to God can be inculcated, progressively, in any life situation. Infact,=\r\n it is the ONLY thing that you can work on. Rest, the world around apart fr=\r\nom you, will follow its own rhythm which has been decided by actions perfor=\r\nmed in the past which one may or maynot be aware of. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nEvery blocka=\r\nge is an opportunity to increase the sense of surrender to something Higher=\r\n, and that in turn acts as a powerful internal catalyst for change.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nCaveat: These answers are based on my current perspective of things. They=\r\n may not be sacrosanct. In future, I myself may or may-not agree to these a=\r\nnswers -:)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n-Regards&lt;br&gt;\n Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; y=\r\nmailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;=\r\nmailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, ga=\r\nurav tripathi &lt;gaurav_alld@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Dear All Lea=\r\nrned members,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp;Following are my questions:=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 1.
