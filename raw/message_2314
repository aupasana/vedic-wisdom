(say for example: &quot;If \n&gt; &gt; a  Brahmana di=\r\nsassociates himself from  lower caste people and \n&gt; &gt; associates only with =\r\nhigher caste people, he attains greatness.&quot;) \n&gt;  \n&gt; On the contrary, there =\r\nhave been notable Brahmanas who have associated themselves with &quot;lower cast=\r\ne people&quot;, changed them into Brahmanas and arguably &quot;attained greatness&quot;.\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; When Srila Prabhupada, for example, came to the West and taught Krishn=\r\na Bhakti to all and sundry with compassion and without differentiating a dr=\r\nug addict hippie from a religious scholar, he sowed the seed for one of the=\r\n greatest bhakti movements ever. I marvel when I look at how many Brahmanas=\r\n of a very high order have been created as a result of his selfless and com=\r\npassionate actions! Imagine a 69 year old man walking barefooted on the str=\r\neets of a very cold foreign city filled with men of material pursuits and w=\r\nondering how to start the mission of establishing devotion to Krishna there=\r\n! Only a man whose heart is devoted to Krishna and his Guru can do it.\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; Upasani maharaj, who lived a century ago, was a great scholar of Vedas an=\r\nd Upanishads. Shirdi Sai Baba once called him god himself in a human body a=\r\nnd did ritual worship to him. He once went and lived in Harijanawada (colon=\r\ny of untouchables) with harijans (untouchables) and did things like sweepin=\r\ng the floors with them. He taught Vedic knowledge to harijans and women.\n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt; Jnaneshwar Maharaj pleaded with the learned Brahmanas and keepers of dh=\r\narma at Paithan to interpret dharma shastras with compassion and wisdom. Wh=\r\nen they failed and the Brahmanas of Alandi continued to consider his family=\r\n (of three brothers and a sister, considered as incarnations of Trinity and=\r\n Shakti) outcastes, he went and lived with lower caste people and taught hi=\r\ns Marathi translation of Bhagavad Gita to them first. He was first adored b=\r\ny lower caste people and Brahmanas came to him later. Irrespective of caste=\r\n, so many people in western India are influenced in their thinking and atti=\r\ntude by Jnaneshwar Maharaj today! His interpretation of Bhagavad Gita is ar=\r\nguably the best ever.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was orthodox in the beg=\r\ninning. Though he worshipped Mother Kaali at the temple, he refused to eat =\r\nHer prasad (food offered to Her and eaten by devotees later) as it was not =\r\ncooked by a Braahmana! He left after the pooja without taking prasad and at=\r\ne food cooked by himself. Such barriers were broken down later as he realiz=\r\ned Self. He requested a rich landlord to give him a lower caste servant he =\r\nhad with him and turned that boy into a saint of a very high order. Despite=\r\n being illiterate, Swami Adbhutananda (Latu Maharaj) had spiritual experien=\r\nces and spiritual realization that many Brahmanas who spend their entire li=\r\nves memorizing Vedas and Upanishads cannot even fathom. When the young man =\r\nwas meditating in the muggy Calcutta weather and was profusely sweating, th=\r\nere were times when Ramakrishna himself sat in front of him and fanned him!=\r\n Such was his love for the young sadhaka from a lower caste. Ramakrishna al=\r\nso freely associated with fallen drunkards (e.g. Girish and Kalipad) and tu=\r\nrned them into devoted men of god. He once took the &quot;karmik power of attorn=\r\ney&quot; from Girish and told him, &quot;you are free to do whatever you want. Drink,=\r\n pursue women and do whatever you want. Nothing will happen to you. Each ba=\r\nd karma performed by you will come to me.&quot; Girish continued his debauched l=\r\nifestyle for some more time, but reformed later. Whenever he did something =\r\nbad, he could not stand the thought that Ramakrishna was to receive the kar=\r\nmik punishment. So he reformed. In later days, Swami Vivekananda held Giris=\r\nh in great respect and Girish touched many lives. Though some believe that =\r\nRamakrishna&#39;s throat cancer was because of taking on Girish&#39;s karmas, obvio=\r\nusly he thought it was worth it. It had several purposes.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        * =\r\n       *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Dharma is not a constant.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Dharma is the right thing on=\r\ne should do. The right action changes from person to person and from time t=\r\no time. The right action is a function of one&#39;s cumulative background throu=\r\ngh many lives. It is possible to lay down some generic guidelines, but they=\r\n can never be perfect. They need to be adopted with time.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *** Dry ric=\r\ne grains cannot be eaten and digested, but they stay fresh longer without g=\r\netting spoiled. Cooked rice is ready to eat and digest, but it becomes stal=\r\ne faster. ***\n&gt;  \n&gt; Similarly, non-specific and unprocessed guidelines (tha=\r\nt need to be processed in order to digest, i.e. put to use) remain applicab=\r\nle longer, while specific and processed guidelines (that can be put to use =\r\nright away) become stale faster and lose their relevance. For example, a st=\r\natement that god is everywhere and one should see happiness and sadness ali=\r\nke is timeless and never expires (like uncooked dry rice grains). But what =\r\ndo you do with it? How do you put it into practice? It is not specific. On =\r\nthe other hand, a specific guideline that one should do so and so ritual or=\r\n not do so and so action is specific to a time and may not apply after some=\r\n time.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The bane of many religions that are based on one prophet and o=\r\nne text is that the text may become stale after some time. It may have been=\r\n perfect for a previous time, but it may be imperfect now.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Though we =\r\nhave texts in sanatana dharma (aka Hinduism) also that preach specific time=\r\n-limited dos and donts, we have several texts that also spread the timeless=\r\n teachings. So sometimes things may seem contradictory. Moreover, people tr=\r\nanslating things do not always get it right. Words are just words. A meanin=\r\ng is the imagery generated by those words in the mind of a reader, which is=\r\n controlled by the mental conditioning of that reader.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Luckily, sanat=\r\nana dharma is not based on one prophet or one text and individual sadhana f=\r\nor individual Self-realization is emphasized. We have a steady stream of Se=\r\nlf-realized saints and yogis, who interpret the words of shastras to us, th=\r\nrough their own words and deeds!\n&gt;  \n&gt; They reject the cooked grains that b=\r\necame stale (i.e. sometimes break orthodox rules), take uncooked grains fro=\r\nm shastra (timeless principles), cook them with the heat of their spiritual=\r\n understanding and serve the cooked food of spiritual instruction to people=\r\n through their words and actions.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thus, I will say to people who have=\r\n a fancy for shastras, &quot;Read shastras, but do keep the above in mind and di=\r\nstinguish between uncooked grains and grains that were cooked long back and=\r\n may have become stale by now. Try to supplement your understanding of shas=\r\ntras using the words and deeds of saints like Aadi Shankara, Jnaneshwar Mah=\r\naraj, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Raghavendra Swami, Samartha Ramadas, Sai Baba, =\r\nRamakrishna Paramahamsa, Ramana Maharshi, Srila Prabhupada etc. Words of a =\r\nrealized person automatically become scripture.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; Caste is a touchy topic. Unfortunately, neither orthodox people nor p=\r\nolitically correct rationalists get it completely correct.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Caste is b=\r\nased on one&#39;s attitude and internal value system. To a braahmana, self-real=\r\nization is the goal in life. To a kshatriya, power and authority over other=\r\ns is the goal in life. To a vaisya, money is the goal. To a shudra, basic p=\r\nhysical comforts are the goal.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, one&#39;s birth and environment d=\r\no influence one&#39;s value system.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If one is born and grows up amid peop=\r\nle who value strength, valor, vanquishing others and exerting power and aut=\r\nhority over others, there is a good chance that one will also start valuing=\r\n those qualities. In other words, if one is born and grows up amid kshatriy=\r\nas, there is a good chance that one will become a kshatriya oneself!\n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\nThat cannot be denied. Thus, there is a good chance that one will end up wi=\r\nth the value system of one&#39;s caste of birth.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, there can be ex=\r\nceptions. Based on other rinas from previous lives and life circumstances, =\r\none&#39;s attitude can change from that indicated by the family one is born int=\r\no. After all, a king like Vishwamitra can become a great braahmana and brah=\r\nma jnaani and a shudra like Vaalmiki can become a great braahmana and brahm=\r\na jnaani. Thus, while the caste of birth is an important factor, it is not =\r\nthe only one. Caste mobility is possible based on other circumstances faced=\r\n in one&#39;s life.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Also, if a braahmana (a per=\r\nson interested in spiritual progress and self-realization) associates with =\r\na shudra (a person interested in bodily comforts), there is a chance that t=\r\nhe former is influenced by the latter and becomes interested in physical pl=\r\neasures. Such an attachment to the body may take one off the course of self=\r\n-realization. Thus, you can see where the quote from Manu Smriti is coming =\r\nfrom.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, making that a rigid rule is debatable. Not every yogi =\r\nwho associates with a shudra develops attachment to body and its comforts. =\r\nOn the contrary, one may change the shudra and make him realize that body i=\r\ns temporary and not worth worrying so much about. Through the association, =\r\nhe may convert the shudra into a purified devotee of god.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        * =\r\n       *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Read things, but have a sense of balance in understanding va=\r\nrious dictums of shastra. At the end, there are infinite people in this wor=\r\nld and infinite viewpoints. We are not responsible for all their views. Mak=\r\ne sure that your understanding of various things is clear and consistent.\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; Make sure that you are making spiritual progress and slowly overcoming=\r\n ego and attachment to the body. Make sure that your devotion to god is inc=\r\nreasing and devotion to body and its comforts is decreasing. Make sure that=\r\n your understanding of what is perennial vs what is temporary is increasing=\r\n and your attachment to temporary things is decreasing. If all these things=\r\n are happening, then you are on the right course and will sooner or later r=\r\nealize what is worth realizing.\n&gt;  \n&gt; That is the most important thing and =\r\nother things are secondary. Let other people do what they see as their job,=\r\n as long as they do not interfere with what you see as your dharma.\n&gt;  \n&gt; B=\r\nest regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarp=\r\nana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyoti=\r\nsh lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish softwar=\r\ne (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) we=\r\nbsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; --------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@...&gt; wrote: =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Sri G Balasubramanian Ji,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I appreciate your effort=\r\ns of posting these material, but i&#39;m not able to understand the motive or t=\r\nhe reason behind these postings.

The same   smrut=\r\ni   also says that such Brahmanas become degraded by associating with falle=\r\nn people(patita-samsargaat)   at their place of work.  That Smruti declares=\r\n, &quot; If a  Brahmana disassociates himself from  lower caste people and assoc=\r\niates only with higher caste people, he attains greatness.  If he does the =\r\nopposite, he becomes a  sudra(Manu4. 245).  Knowledgeable people hold the v=\r\niew that many of the professions like  software engineering , technological=\r\n jobs,a  Govt. servant(raja sevaka),  a teacher working in a school, a doct=\r\nor etc. etc. --- all of these professions fall under the category of  sudra=\r\n`s  domain.  They hold that a Brahmin should not take employment from anyon=\r\ne (especially from sudras).  In this regard  the Kurma Purana   says---\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot;Those Brahmanas who make a living from protecting cows, engage in trade, =\r\nbecome artists, take the occupation of servants, and lend money on interest=\r\n are no better than sudras (......... vipran  sudra-vad acharet).&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot;O Brahmanas, one who does not study the  Vedas (anadhitya sruti dvijah)  =\r\nbut carefully endeavours for other pursuits is certainly foolish( sa sammud=\r\no) and ostracized from vedic life( veda-bahyo dvijatibhih).  Brahmanas  sho=\r\nuld not speak to such a person&quot;(na sambhasyo). \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But, Srimad Bhagav=\r\natam   speaks of  a permissible  exception  and  mentions the circumstances=\r\n in which a Brahmana may pursue  another occupation.  Verse 47 of chapter 1=\r\n7 of Canto 11 says that if a Brahmana  can not support himself through his =\r\nregular duties and is suffering,he  may adopt the occupation of a merchant =\r\n and overcome his destitute condition by buying and selling material things=\r\n.  If he continues to suffer extreme poverty even as a merchant, then he ma=\r\ny adopt the occupation of a kshatriya.  But under no circumstances become l=\r\nike a dog, accepting an ordinary master. Srimad Bhagavatam (12.3.35) also s=\r\ntates  that this is one of the symptoms of Kaliyuga. It says,&quot; Businessmen =\r\nwill engage in petty commerce and earn their money by cheating. Even when t=\r\nhere is no emergency, people will consider any degraded occupation quite ac=\r\nceptable.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Dharma Sastras  declare that if one takes birth in a=\r\n Brahmana  family but does not cultivate scriptural knowledge, he can not b=\r\ne accepted as a Brahmana.  Visnu Dharma Sastra 93.7 says that religious- mi=\r\nnded  people should never give even a drop of water to the hypocritical son=\r\n of a   Brahmana,  who is ignorant of the Vedas.  Manu Smriti 2.157   says =\r\nthat a brahmana  who does not study the  Vedas  is  similar to a wooden ele=\r\nphant or a deer made of skin, i.e.,  an elephant or deer only in name but d=\r\noes not function effectively as such.  Moreover,  the same   smriti  says t=\r\nhat until a  Brahmana  qualifies himself in the  Vedas, he is on the same l=\r\nevel as a sudra(2.172 Sudrena hi samah tavad  yavad vede na jayate). In Mah=\r\nabharata, Santi Parva 189.7  it has been stated that Brahmanas who lead a l=\r\nife of violence, lies and greed, who are impure and indulge in all kinds of=\r\n  karmic  activity in order to maintain their\n&gt; &gt;  lives(sarvakarmopajivina=\r\nh ) are degraded to the status of sudras(dvija sudratam gatah).  Such a per=\r\nson , who eats anything and everything without discrimination, who is attac=\r\nhed to worldly things, who will accept any occupation just to make money(sa=\r\nrvo karma karo asuchih), who has given up Vedic  Dharma (tyakta vedastvanar=\r\nchah)  and proper behaviour is called  a  sudra (sa vai sudra iti smrutah).=\r\n  Let each one of our community weigh our  respective merit and  conclude a=\r\ns to where we are as Brahmins.\n&gt; &gt; (to be continued)\n&gt; &gt; G.Balasubramanian\n=\r\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
