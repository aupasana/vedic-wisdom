He actu=\r\nally said in his\n&gt; autobiography ( Hamari Virasat aur Vasiyat, My Inheritan=\r\nces and \nWill,\n&gt; loosely translated) that once when he was 14 years old and=\r\n sitting \nfor\n&gt; his Morning Sandhya,  a divine figure appeared, guru\n&gt; Sarw=\r\neshwaranandji. His Guru then made him realise his past lives \nand\n&gt; gave hi=\r\nm the work for this life.\n&gt; He took him back as in a flash to the past. He =\r\nrealised that he had\n&gt; been born as Thakur, before that Saint Kabir and bef=\r\nore that Guru \nof\n&gt; Chatrapati Shivaji, Guru Ramdass.\n&gt; \n&gt; I will try to lo=\r\ncate the exact link and send it.The general site is\n&gt; www.awgp.org I rememb=\r\ner the book is there on pdf in English \nsomewhere\n&gt; online.

This is an unbelievable experience that I\n&gt; have had. I have not=\r\n added anything from my own. I am writing \nexactly\n&gt; as was happened in my =\r\nlife. I am going back to the period of \n1973/74.\n&gt; Kindly read this only wh=\r\nen you are in religious mood.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I was working as telegraphist =\r\nat Okha Port Post office near \nDwarka.\n&gt; My duty was from 7 am to 7 pm and =\r\nI was getting late fee allowance \nfor\n&gt; extra duty. There was a Telephone e=\r\nxchange just opposite to Post\n&gt; office and due to same Dep=E2=80=99t; I had=\r\n friendship with some \nTelephone\n&gt; operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we =\r\nwill call him as Mr. Patel)\n&gt; was working as Operator. He was a staunch dev=\r\notee of=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 shri\n&gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him =\r\nhe was always talking \nabout\n&gt; shri Thakur. We came close day by day. There=\r\n was a weekly \ngathering at\n&gt; his home called SATSANGA. He was singing devo=\r\ntional songs created \nby\n&gt; him and was weeping while singing. He was readin=\r\ng Ramkrishna\n&gt; Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending this weekl=\r\ny \nmeeting\n&gt; on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of=\r\n 30\n&gt; then. We were used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after duty hours\n&gt;=\r\n and were talking only about Thakur.\n&gt; &gt; One day when we were at sea shore =\r\nhe suddenly told me--\n=E2=80=9CRawalbhai,\n&gt; some guest have come to my home=\r\n and my wife is remembering me. My \nson\n&gt; will come in a few minutes to cal=\r\nl me. I shall have to go now=E2=80=9D. -\n-\n&gt; And with my surprise his 8 yea=\r\nrs old son came to call him. \n&gt; &gt; At one another incident he told me that t=\r\nhere will be a plane \ncrash\n&gt; tomorrow and that also happened. I was very m=\r\nuch impressed about \nhim.\n&gt; He could foresee the events. One day I had to g=\r\no to Dwarka by Bus, \nhe\n&gt; told me not to go through bus, as bus tire will b=\r\ne punctured. Yet I\n&gt; went to Bus station but bus did not come from Dwarka a=\r\ns was \npunctured\n&gt; on the way. This was surprising.\n&gt; &gt; This all incidents =\r\nmade me to believe that he had some super \npower\n&gt; and this was due to Ramk=\r\nrishandev worship only. I was attracted to\n&gt; shri Thakur. One day I thought=\r\n, I should also be disciple of shri\n&gt; Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1=\r\n974. At 7 pm I surrendered \nmyself\n&gt; to Thakur at Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s house=\r\n before Thakur picture. I prayed \nhim\n&gt; deeply from my heart to accept me a=\r\ns his follower and bestow his \ngrace. \n&gt; &gt; Next day morning I had a discuss=\r\nion with my wife at 6.10 morning\n&gt; while taking the tea. As my duty was to =\r\nstart from 7 am I was \nwaking\n&gt; up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in th=\r\ne morning that I have\n&gt; accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife =\r\nwas annoyed and \nshe\n&gt; argued with me a lot. =E2=80&quot;=E2=80=9CWhy should you=\r\n take such a hasty \ndecision?\n&gt; Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa =\r\nKali at Calcutta. He \nwas a\n&gt; great Saint but our Guru should be living one=\r\n, who can guide us, \ngive\n&gt; us Mantra etc. etc. Better you take Dixa from S=\r\nhri Ram Sharma \nAcharya\n&gt; since you are doing Gayatri Mantra=E2=80=9D--.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Her arguments were right at her place as people in general not \nknow\n&gt; mu=\r\nch about Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I have taken\n&gt; hasty de=\r\ncision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --\n&gt; &gt; But I remember that Mr.=\r\n Patel had told me that Thakur was telling\n&gt; their disciples to test him be=\r\nfore accepting him. I also decided to\n&gt; test Thakur. I immediately told my =\r\nwife that =E2=80&quot;=E2=80=9CSee, Mr. Patel \nhas\n&gt; never come to our home. You=\r\n have also not seen him. He has never \nasked\n&gt; me where I am living. Suppos=\r\ne Mr. Patel is coming to our house \nwithin\n&gt; 10 to 15 minutes, would you be=\r\nlieve that my selection for Thakur is\n&gt; perfect?=E2=80=9D--\n&gt; &gt; She laughed=\r\n at me=E2=80&quot;=E2=80=9CHow it is possible? I don=E2=80=99t believe.=E2=80=9D=\r\n-\n-\n&gt; &gt; I prayed Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediately to justify my\n&gt; =\r\ndecision and convince my wife. =E2=80=98I want to test your existence \neven=\r\n\n&gt; today.=E2=80=99\n&gt; &gt; To our great surprise, Mr. Patel was at my home at 0=\r\n6.30 in the\n&gt; morning with angry mood. What he told?\n&gt; &gt; =E2=80=98 How dare=\r\n you test Thakur this way? Do you know what happened?\n&gt; Yesterday was my ni=\r\nght duty and I had just come to my home at 05.30\n&gt; mornings today and tried=\r\n to sleep for 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly Thakur\n&gt; pulled my blanket and told me=\r\n that-=E2=80=9C Go to your friend=E2=80=99s \nhouse. He\n&gt; is waiting for you=\r\n. He wants to test me. I will show you his \nhouse=E2=80=9D\n&gt; &gt; I immediatel=\r\ny rushed to your home. Thakur was guiding me the way \nto\n&gt; your house and p=\r\nushing me too. What you want? Why you are \ndisturbing\n&gt; him in such an earl=\r\ny morning for such a silly things?=E2=80=99\n&gt; &gt; We both were so excited and=\r\n surprised that we had no words that\n&gt; Morning. \n&gt; &gt; I will never forget th=\r\nat 5th April, a miracle day in my life. \nThere\n&gt; were some more Devine expe=\r\nriences about Shri Thakur but I will \nwrite\n&gt; it sometime.\n&gt; &gt; Dear Sir, an=\r\nd forum members, Ramkrishandev is still alive on the\n&gt; earth. This is a fac=\r\nt I have written and no word is added to\n&gt; exaggerate.=C2=A0 May Shri Thaku=\r\nr bless all of us.\n&gt; &gt; Dr. Ashwin Rawal Ahmedabad\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n     Add more friends to your messenger and enjoy!
