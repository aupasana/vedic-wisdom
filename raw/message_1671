Whenever i \n&gt; found s=\r\nomebody struggeling with life & death, i have used this \n&gt; mantra. I know 2=\r\n specific cases for whom i recited this mantra, one \n&gt; was a cancer patient=\r\n and other was in very critical condition due to \n&gt; grave bike-truck accide=\r\nnt. i am happy to note that both are alive. \n&gt; (its not that because of my =\r\nrecitation-; )\n&gt; i&#39;ve a faith in this mantra and instinctively recite when =\r\nsomebody \n&gt; is in serious physical trouble.\n&gt; \n&gt; I recite &quot;bandhanaat&quot; -\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; By the way, shri Sanjay rath has given a meaning in his book on \n&gt; vedic=\r\n remedies.\n&gt; \n&gt; wish you all a very happy Ramkrishna Birth day (english dat=\r\ne wise)\n&gt; \n&gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups=\r\n. com, &quot;waspieswaspies&quot; \n&gt; &lt;waspieswaspies@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste all=\r\n, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sorry to encroach upon this thread. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I would like to s=\r\nhare something about the miraculous MahaMrityunjay\n&gt; &gt; mantra. I have alway=\r\ns come across different variations in the\n&gt; &gt; pronounciation of the MahaMri=\r\ntyunyay mantra, more specifically in \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; word &#39;Bandhanaan&#39; . I have =\r\nheard it being pronounced as &#39;Aum \n&gt; Tryambakam\n&gt; &gt; Yajamahe...Urvarukm iva=\r\n Bandhanaam&#39;, &#39;Bandhanaat&#39; and &#39;Bandhanaan&#39; . \n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; have no clue as to w=\r\nhat part of the Rig Veda to look for - to \n&gt; verify\n&gt; &gt; the correct sanskri=\r\nt word. So, I have always pronounced it with a\n&gt; &gt; silent &#39;aan&#39; at the end =\r\njust because it &#39;felt&#39; right. (Still don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; know if it&#39;s right) But it h=\r\nas nevertheless, always produced\n&gt; &gt; positive results especially in regard =\r\nto curing illnesses.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Such is the generosity of the Lord! :) \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Har Har Mahadev!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Jitend=\r\nra Trivedi &lt;trivedijv@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shree Ajit Bhai,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; pranaam and thankyou for the wonderful explanation of the Mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hari Om Harr\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jitu\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Wed, Feb 18, 2009 at 1=\r\n:05 PM, gulatiganesh \n&gt; &lt;gulatiganesh@ &gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Shri Aji=\r\nt Ji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for the reply and ela=\r\nborately explaining the meaning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ganesh Gulati\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; &lt;vedic-wisdom% 40yahoogroups.=\r\n com&gt;, Ajit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Krishnan\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;ajit.krishnan@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe I&#39;m deluding myself, but I see a =\r\nstrong similarity \n&gt; between\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this mantra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and the savitur =\r\ngayatri. The words in the first half of this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantra, and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; first two padas of the gayatri have a strong correspondence. \n&gt; It is\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; certainly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a potent mantra which will provide true spiritua=\r\nl upliftment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here is a translation based on the commen=\r\ntary of the Rishi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shaunaka -- We\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pray to the eye of all t=\r\nhree.
