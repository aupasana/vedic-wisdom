So it is right time to re=\r\nveal\n&gt; the secret of learning Vedic Astrology. Astrology is divine science =\r\nso\n&gt; you need blessings of your Guru, Lord Ganesh and other gods. I am\n&gt; su=\r\nggesting you to recite the following mantras to recite one mala daily.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Om Gurave Namah\n&gt; \n&gt; Om Gang Ganpataye Namah\n&gt; \n&gt; There are some more mant=\r\nras but you will not have so much time for it so\n&gt; I am suggesting you only=\r\n two.\n&gt; \n&gt; Those who do not have any Mala (like Tulsi etc.), they may use &quot;=\r\nKar\n&gt; Mala&quot;. &quot;Kar&quot; means hand so you will use your hand to count the number=\r\n\n&gt; Mantras.\n&gt; \n&gt; You should use your right hand to count mantras. You shoul=\r\nd use your\n&gt; thumb for counting like in the picture given below,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Note :- You should avoid putting thumb on lines and tip of fingers.\n&gt; \n&gt; W=\r\nhen you complete one cycle of ten, use your left hand and its thumb in\n&gt; th=\r\ne same manner to count one cycle. when you have completed the 10 cycle\n&gt; or=\r\n 10 x 10 =3D 100 times (menas you have recited the Mantras 100 times\n&gt; till=\r\n now) you would have completed the 10 points on left hand too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now rem=\r\nove thumb from left hand and count the balance 8 Mantras in the\n&gt; following=\r\n manner.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Now you one Mala of 108 Mantras is complete. So you do =\r\nnot need any type\n&gt; of mala to recite the mantras. Kar Mala is very very po=\r\nwerful too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Important :- After some months you will see the difference=\r\n in your\n&gt; vision. There will be unbelievable changes in you learning capac=\r\nity -\n&gt; UNBELIEVABLE UNBELIEVABLE UNBELIEVABLE CAPACITY TO LEARN VEDIC\n&gt; AS=\r\nTROLOGY. IT IS MY PROMISE.\n&gt; \n&gt; with regards\n&gt; \n&gt; sushil dikshit\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
