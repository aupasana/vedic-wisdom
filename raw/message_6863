Gayatri, especially in Homan seems to make things aw=\r\naken in me, even with a tinge of sexual desire, yet still making me more sp=\r\niritual. Separately, for the past few months, I have been having this heavy=\r\n weight of a depressive feeling (due to several events/situations in my lif=\r\ne) which just hasnt left me, and even the Gayatri/Homam doesnt relieve exce=\r\npt immediately after a Homam for less than a day. After some reading around=\r\n and doing some astrology, I finally arrived at a Kali mantra - Om Kreem Ka=\r\nlikaye namah, and I have started meditating on that every morning, but I st=\r\nill do weekend homams with Savitur Gayatri. But things have changed now. Th=\r\ne Kali mantra is very punishing in a mental tightness kind of way, yet stil=\r\nl helps me deal with mental hardship without completely giving up/getting a=\r\nngry/stressed. So I have continued it. Yet the day I do Savitur Gayatri hom=\r\nam, the Gayatri results seems a bit weaker - I have no idea why. Also, if I=\r\n dont meditate on the Kali mantra later on in the same day (i.e. if I try t=\r\no drop a day of doing Kali mantra), I get into conflicts much more easily. =\r\nIs there some kind of conflict between the two? \n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nSundeep\n\n\n"}}
