The Jnani (enlightened sage) however regards=\r\n\nthe personal God (also) as none other than himself; and Self-love, in this=\r\n\ncase, is or becomes the love of God (personal).\n\nIn his case, devotion is =\r\ndefined as Self-realisation. Others, who treat the\npersonal God as somethin=\r\ng outside themselves develop deep devotion to such a\nGod and finally sink t=\r\nheir personality in Him.\n\nThe love-smitten chord of Self, trembles and pass=\r\nes in music out of sight. In\nfact, worship, nay, all intense concentrated t=\r\nhought or feeling, is the\nmerging of the mind in the object worshipped or c=\r\noncentrated on. Intense\nfaith in the personal God, however, carries the dev=\r\notee easily and naturally\nto faith in and devotion to the impersonal Absolu=\r\nte (Swarupa Brahman).\n\nMostly, the beginnings of devotion to (personal) God=\r\n are traceable to a\ndesire to avoid sorrows and attain happiness. So, with =\r\ngreat keenness and\nzest people approach their God, investing Him with name =\r\nand form, and attain\nthe objects they desire. Even after such attainment, t=\r\nhe habit of devotion\ncontinues and the mind trained to worship God with for=\r\nm and name develops\nthe power to dwell on the Formless and Nameless.\n\nThe e=\r\nvanescent objects achieved by the first flow of devotion to a personal\nGod =\r\ndo not fully satisfy the aspiring soul who thirsts after enduring\nhappiness=\r\n. With this ever new impetus to seek something more than relative\nhappiness=\r\n, the progressing soul ultimately drops name and form as its object\nof cont=\r\nemplation and thus attempts to conceive of or realise the Absolute\n(Brahman=\r\n). Thus devotion to a personal God gets transformed or ripened\ngradually in=\r\nto devotion to the Impersonal, which is the same as Vichara\n(enquiry) and R=\r\nealisation.\n\nInvestigation into the Self is nothing other than devotion.\n=\r\n=E2=80=94 Vivekachudamani, verse 32\n\nDevotion may at the outset be by fits =\r\nand starts.

When devotion (person=\r\nal) is ripe, a moment&#39;s instruction\n(Sravana) suffices for the next step in=\r\n Jnana.
