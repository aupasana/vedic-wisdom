The reason being I will be honest in t=\r\nhis God&#39;s place. Unlike you all who are determined to give yourselves to th=\r\ne Lord I am not ready for extreme level of spirituality.I like praying god =\r\nbut don&#39;t want to commit saying that I don&#39;t want any riches,any happiness =\r\netc. \n\nI don&#39;t want to go for something in an extreme level and later face =\r\nthe wrath of God. So my question is I believe purnahuti is the part where o=\r\nne surrenders completely and gives this commitment. I want to call god in f=\r\nire pray, meditate keep it simple. As fire is the most auspicious form I am=\r\n tempted to pray God in that medium. So can I skip the purnahuti section. D=\r\no I need to make any changes in sankalpam? \n\nThanks and regards,\nPratima\n\n\n=\r\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;naaraayana_iyer&quot; &lt;narayan.iyer@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Shri Utpal,\n&gt; \n&gt; This is just wonderful !!! How awesome,=\r\n just get goosebumps thinking about it :)\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope people realize this a=\r\nnd stop thinking that after doing homam they will start getting all kinds o=\r\nf material benefits. It may or may not depending on the rna & karma.\n&gt; \n&gt; V=\r\nimalananda, is/was I guess, just one of those unique personalities we are f=\r\nortunate to read about, and guide us in an indirect way.\n&gt; \n&gt; Warm Regards\n=\r\n&gt; Narayan\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_p=\r\nathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear friends,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A known person who is trouble=\r\nd from worldly people, in his disgust, randomly opened Aghora-III and his e=\r\nyes fell on following page where in Vimalananda says:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Its true Ro=\r\nbby,&quot; said Vimalananda in conclusion, &quot;it is true that when Krishna wants t=\r\no bless someone He takes away that person&#39;s money, fame, pleasure and other=\r\n worldly joys. Eventually, when that man has lost everything and everyone h=\r\ne knows has deserted him, he has no alternative but to remember Krishna and=\r\n get lost in His bewitching eyes.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The person immediately infomed =\r\nabout this and i thought of putting it on the list.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jay Shri Krish=\r\nna\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
