These books =\r\nhave a picture of pyramid. There was a church in LA area where the spirit o=\r\nf these ancient masters used to come and teach about karma theory, reincarn=\r\nation and other spiritual fundamentals.\n\nIn india I understand one swamiji =\r\nhas procured land in hardwar area and is building pyramids and is going to =\r\ndo homans and other pooja inside the pyramids so that it can cure diseases,=\r\n I believe his name is Kumar Swamiji. I donot know any more details but I h=\r\neard once a lecture about pyramids and healing.\n\nSo I do believe there is m=\r\nore to pyramids and it needs to be researched.\n\nBest Regards\nMitesh\n--- In =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Nama=\r\nste\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I was going through a website of an organization based in Banga=\r\nlore which talks about meditiation under pyraminds.
