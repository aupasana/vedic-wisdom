Ramu Setty and Smt.Muniammal,\n&gt; would take me for Sri Bhagavan=\r\n=E2=80=99s darshan.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus I started visiting the Maharshi right from my=\r\n childhood. Being a native\n&gt; of Tiruvannamaiai,it was my great good fortune=\r\n that I was able to have\n&gt; Bhagavan=E2=80=99s darshan till His Mahasamadhi =\r\nin 1950.\n&gt; \n&gt; When Bhagavan was staying at Virupaksha Cave, devotees would =\r\ncome to town\n&gt; singing Aksharamanamalai. We would eagerly wait for their ar=\r\nrival to offer\n&gt; them cooked food. Only after such offering would we eat. T=\r\nhis continued\n&gt; without a day=E2=80=99s break till Bhagavan=E2=80=99s mothe=\r\nr started cooking at Skandashram.\n&gt; Our house was open to devotees of Bhaga=\r\nvan at all times.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even while Bhagavan was at Virupaksha Cave, occasion=\r\nally we used to go there\n&gt; and offer biksha. On one such occasion the leaf-=\r\nplates we had brought were\n&gt; just enough for the devotees present and there=\r\n was none for me. Being young,\n&gt; I started crying. Bhagavan called me and c=\r\noming to know the reason, consoled\n&gt; me by providing me with a leaf. Bhagav=\r\nan understood a child=E2=80=99s feelings, and\n&gt; He has been gracious to me =\r\nthroughout my life!\n&gt; \n&gt; It was Bhagavan who introduced me into religious t=\r\nexts. Once Bhagavan wrote\n&gt; the first verse of Dakshinamurti Stotra on a sl=\r\nip of paper and told me to\n&gt; learn it by heart and repeat it on my next vis=\r\nit.Thus I learnt the\n&gt; Dakshinamurti Stotra. I would often forget the first=\r\n word of a verse and\n&gt; Bhagavan would help me. Then writing down the first =\r\nword of each verse of\n&gt; Dakshinamurti Stotra, Bhagavan gave me the slip of =\r\npaper to help remember\n&gt; the sequence.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the first of each Tamil mont=\r\nh I would go round the Hill along with my\n&gt; mother, and on the way we would=\r\n walk into the Ashram to pay homage to\n&gt; Bhagavan who would receive us with=\r\n a smile and sometimes ask us to take\n&gt; breakfast. Once, when as usual two =\r\niddlies were served on my plate, I asked\n&gt; for one more.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bhagavan turn=\r\ned to me and said that I could have one more after eating the\n&gt; two. When I=\r\n had finished eating them, Bhagavan asked whether I would like to\n&gt; have mo=\r\nre, and I replied No. Bhagavan, said with a smile: Why did you ask\n&gt; for mo=\r\nre even before starting to eat? Thus Bhagavan taught the lesson that\n&gt; one =\r\nshould not be greedy.\n&gt; \n&gt; When my mother passed away, I went to the Ashram=\r\n to convey the news to\n&gt; Bhagavan. Bhagavan graciously looked at me and rel=\r\nieved me of my intense\n&gt; grief.Bhagavan smilingly told me that my mother wa=\r\ns as old as his stay at\n&gt; Arunachala. With folded hands I prayed to Bhagava=\r\nn to protect our family,\n&gt; and He graciously nodded His head by way of appr=\r\noval.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bhagavan was not merely a spiritual Master of the highest order,=\r\n but our\n&gt; mother, our father and our all!\n&gt; \n&gt; Source:\n&gt; http://www.sriram=\r\nanamaharshi.org/pdf/Saranagathi_eNewsletter_June_2011.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; =E0=B0=\r\n&quot;=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n&gt; =E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=81\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
