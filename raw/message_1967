Can you please kindly relate free-will/fate at gran=\r\ndeur level? If we go to the root cause of all the causes..When the current =\r\nuniverse came into existance at the moment of big-bang (or maybe universe a=\r\nlready existed, it just changed its form at that moment so that it became p=\r\nerceptable to us mortal) , was it resulting from free-will of its own fate =\r\nfrom possibly last grand resolution of the universe? \n Whos free-will or fa=\r\nte was it? Is it cumulative free-will(resolve) of all souls that came into =\r\nexistence then or the cumulative fate of all the soul from past universe? h=\r\now did the first karma/action or first reaction was concieved by a soul wit=\r\nhout an external stimulus?\n\nAlso, what is the extent of fate/free will in a=\r\nnybody&#39;s life? Is taking each breath is a result of free will or fate? We d=\r\noing yagna/homam is it free-will excercised or was it fated?\nHow can somebo=\r\ndy differentiate between any moment being parcel from fate or a new act? of=\r\n it has to be simultaneous all the time?\n\nThanks for all your sincere thoug=\r\nhts!\n\nThanks\n\n\n\n\n"}}
