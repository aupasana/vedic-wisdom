Next to the Kaali shrine, there was a Krishna shrine with a beautiful Kri=\r\nshna idol and Ramakrishna used to meditate there sometimes. Due to an accid=\r\nent when another priest was carrying the idol during a festival, the idol b=\r\nroke oneday.\n=C2=A0\nThe priests and the highly learned scholars were in a q=\r\nuandary and conferred to decide what to do. The shastras were clear that a =\r\nbroken idol could not be worshipped at a temple and had to be immersed in f=\r\nlowing water. So the learned scholars recommended immersing the idol in Gan=\r\nges.\n=C2=A0\nRamakrishna was asked by the temple administration for his view=\r\n. He thought for a while and said calmly, &quot;Suppose you have a son and his l=\r\neg is broken. Will you try to fix it and keep the son at home and continue =\r\nto love him or will you throw your son into Ganges?&quot; His simple common sens=\r\ne view prevailed and shastras were set aside! In fact, Ramakrishna himself =\r\nfixed the broken idol. It was re-installed at the temple and continued to b=\r\ne worshipped.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nThe idol was in your house for 5=\r\n6 years. Suddenly, the new found knowledge is creating problems in your min=\r\nd, after all these years! What good is that knowledge which spoils mental p=\r\neace by creating doubts, fear=C2=A0and insecurity? One is better off being =\r\nignorant than having such knowledge.\n=C2=A0\nIf you have an idol that was wo=\r\nrshipped to some extent by your ancestors for 56 years, it would&#39;ve capture=\r\nd and stored some of the positive energy and positive thoughts of those peo=\r\nple. It would be a great blessing to have at your house.\n=C2=A0\nIt should n=\r\not be a problem if you cannot do much ritual worshp to the idol. Just doing=\r\n simple things should suffice.\n=C2=A0\nWhenever you see the idol, imagine th=\r\nat there is Ganesha in it for real. Love the Ganesa who is in that idol. Bo=\r\nw to him now and then, when you get a chance. Show some fruit or raisins or=\r\n something to the idol now and then, when you get a chance, and imagine tha=\r\nt Ganesa tasted them. Every few months, clean the idol in water and wipe it=\r\n (to keep it clean).\n=C2=A0\nThe key is not how detailed your rituals are an=\r\nd whether you are doing 5 or 16 or 64 or more services in your ritual. The =\r\nkey is how strongly you imagine a real deity in that idol and how deeply yo=\r\nu love that real deity that you visualize in the idol. Rituals are only mea=\r\nnt to facilitate such a visualization and increase such a love. They are ne=\r\nither necessary nor sufficient for establishing a relationship with a deity=\r\n (which is, after all, the purpose of keeping an idol)!\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nHow does a metallic (or stone or whatever) object become divin=\r\ne?\n=C2=A0\nOf course, each object and each atom of this universe is filled, =\r\nin essence, by Aatman or Brahman, i.e. non-dual god. But, that would apply =\r\nto the idol as well as a sofa. But you look at an idol as being more divine=\r\n than the sofa. So we are not talking about the all-pervading non-dual god =\r\nhere.

Does the idol get that deity in it simply because of =\r\nits shape? Of course not!\n=C2=A0\nAll lokas and all devatas are present with=\r\nin you in a microcosmic form. By the force of your thought, you concentrate=\r\n a part of the deity who is within you into the idol (or any object). When =\r\na priest with a good level of purity and good ability to visualize (which c=\r\nomes from internal purity and lack of ego) does praana pratishthaa in an id=\r\nol, his visualization works using the praana pratishthaa mantra as an instr=\r\nument and a deity&#39;s essence enters the idol.\n=C2=A0\nEven if you do not do a=\r\n praana pratishthaa formally, deity&#39;s essence will slowly be established in=\r\n the idol if you keep imagining deity in the idol. It is all about the powe=\r\nr of thought! Thoughts of a pure mind that is not weighed down by a dense a=\r\nnd heavy ego and not colored by too many terrible vaasanaas work faster, bu=\r\nt even thoughts of an impure=C2=A0mind that is weighed down by a dense and =\r\nheavy ego and colored by several terrible vaasanaas will also work, albeit=\r\n=C2=A0slowly. If you keep imagining a deity with some qualities in an idol =\r\nover a long time, essence=C2=A0of such a deity will invariably be establish=\r\ned in the idol over the time! Otherwise, it is just a metallic object.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nIf you imagine a deity who is angry with you for not taking good care o=\r\nf him, you will slowly create such a form in that idol. Please stop this ne=\r\ngativity. Imagine a beautiful, pleasant, happy=C2=A0and saattwika form with=\r\n whom you can fall in love. If a feeling of love overwhelms your mind when =\r\nyou see the idol (instead of thoughts of fear and deity&#39;s anger), it will i=\r\nndeed create such a presence in the idol and do you good.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nThere are several *well-meaning* people out there with half-ba=\r\nked understanding that is not based on any direct experience, who go around=\r\n scaring people in several matters relating to god, religion and spirituali=\r\nty. But god is not to be feared.\n=C2=A0\nLove god. Do not fear god. When you=\r\nr father or mother shout at you or punish you, it=C2=A0is for a good reason=\r\n and it will eventually be for your good. They are not really angry at you =\r\nand they actually love you. Similarly, when god punishes you or gives bad r=\r\nesults, it is for a good reason and it will eventually be for your good. Do=\r\n not fear god even when god gives you bad results. Always *love* god and lo=\r\nve god very deeply. More deeply than you love your parents, spouse, childre=\r\nn etc. That is a simple principle for sureshot=C2=A0spiritual progress.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nGood luck with your Ganesha idol no matter what you decide to do with i=\r\nt!\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------=\r\n- --------- --------- ---------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Vedic=\r\nAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rolo=\r\nger.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdo=\r\nm\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyo=\r\ntish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Cent=\r\nre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n=C2=A0\n----- Original Message=\r\n ----- \nFrom: &quot;Ram R&quot; &lt;mantra2379@yahoo. co.in&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogro=\r\nups. com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, September 02, 2009 1:22 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdo=\r\nm] Right-sided Trunk Shri Ganesha Idol\n=C2=A0\n&gt; OM Namo Bhagvate Venkatesha=\r\nya\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear All,\n&gt; \n&gt; This ia my first posting in this forum.\n&gt; \n&gt; Am writ=\r\ning in as am in need of advice regarding a Shri Ganesha idol which we found=\r\n during puja in our home.

This idol=\r\n has its trunk to the right side and has been there in our house since the =\r\nlast 56 years. I recently came to know that when an idol of Shri Ganesha wi=\r\nth its trunk to the right is kept at home one needs to worship it daily in =\r\na dedicated way and we have honestly not being doing this all these years. =\r\nIt was infact purchased by my grandmother 56 years ago as per my father who=\r\n has been seeing it since then. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I feel that it is better =\r\nto donate it to a temple which would worship it daily. As it has been there=\r\n for so long in the house we are feeling hesitant about doing this. Would b=\r\ne extremely grateful if I could have\n advice as to what would be the correc=\r\nt thing to do and how to go about doing the same.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Kindly p=\r\nardon me if this is not the appropriate forum for such a query.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; Thanks,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ramesh M&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Bangalore &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/B=\r\nLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      &lt;!--1--&gt;&lt;hr size=3D1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; Love Cric=\r\nket?
