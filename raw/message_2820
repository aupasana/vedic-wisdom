The moder=\r\nn day versions of both these faiths have deviated much from the original me=\r\nssages.\n\nHinduism also has deviated from the spirit of the vedas with corru=\r\nptions entering into the practise of caste etc...but still is much better i=\r\nn preservation of the original meaning.\n\n\nYogananda, Sivananda , Maharishi =\r\nMahesh Yogi and various saints including Srila Prabhupada when they entered=\r\n the west in the early 1960&#39;s had the unenviable task of explaining some of=\r\n the concepts in terms which the westerner could understand. The parallel i=\r\nmagery is what comes from that...\n\n\nIf somebody could separate the chaff fr=\r\nom the grain and read the books they will definetly reach salvation in thos=\r\ne paths, if not it is much better to stick to Hinduism.\n\nI apologize before=\r\nhand if any feathers are ruffled.\n\nRegards\nVemparlaRamKishore \n\n\n\n\n--- In v=\r\nedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Nam=\r\naste,\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; To add to my query,=C2=A0a good number of=C2=A0religions e=\r\nxplicitly prohibit idol worship.

At the same time, some not-so-well- known temples seem =\r\nto have a powerful divine presence.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I was very impressed with th=\r\ne=C2=A0Krishna temple in Mayapur (ISKCON head office is there), Girnar hill=\r\ns in Gujarat and Arunachalam hills in Tiruvannamalai (Ramana Maharshi&#39;s pla=\r\nce). There is a tremendous amount of spiritual energy in those places. Ther=\r\ne are several temples where the idol is practically alive. For example, eve=\r\nn 123 years after Ramakrishna Paramahamsa left, the Kaali idol at Dakshines=\r\nhwar is &quot;alive&quot;. I did not get the same impression at the famous Kalighat t=\r\nemple which is also in Calcutta.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; There was one small temple in T=\r\namil Nadu that I was taken to by a priest who took me to visit about 30 tem=\r\nples all over Tamil Nadu before we did the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in=\r\n 2006. I never heard of that temple before and it seemed like a small templ=\r\ne. The name of the=C2=A0form of the divine Mother=C2=A0present there was a =\r\nTamil language name and I did not understand it. I do not even remember the=\r\n name now. But, when I closed my eyes and started meditating with my mantra=\r\n in front of the idol, I was dazzled by a vision of a very fierce goddess w=\r\nhose face was emiting rays like Sun. I felt that there was a powerful prese=\r\nnce there. Unfortunately, I do not remember the name of the place or the go=\r\nddess, but it is a temple without roof over the goddess. They tried to put =\r\na roof over the goddess a few times, but the roof came down in a fire accid=\r\nent each time and they finally decided that the goddess likes open air and =\r\nno roof. Though we spent only 5 min and left\n&gt;  in a hurry, I was very plea=\r\nsed with that temple. Someone from Tamil Nadu probably knows the name of th=\r\ne temple and goddess.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Like this, I am sure there are many temple=\r\ns with a powerful divine presence across India.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Apart from the K=\r\naali temple at Dakshineshwar, one of my best experiences when meditating wa=\r\ns at the Krishna/Vitthal temple at Aalandi near Pune. I am sure that Jnanes=\r\nhwar Maharaj is still meditating in the underground chamber there.\n&gt; =C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Even the middle of a busy road in India is bet=\r\nter for meditating than a temple in USA. These western countries are so fil=\r\nled with rajas and tamas. There is rajas in India too, but there is a good =\r\namount of sattwa there. Thus, any temple in India will be a good place to m=\r\neditate, but my view is that there is not much left at *some* temples. But =\r\nsome temples are really good.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; If one has a chance to spend a few=\r\n months doing spiritual sadhana near a temple, I suggest the following:\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; Mayapur, Dakshineshwar, Puri and Kamakhya in east India, Kurtaalam=\r\n, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam hills)=C2=A0and Narayana=C2=A0vanam (near Tir=\r\nupati)=C2=A0in south India, Shirdi, Aalandi, Dwaraka=C2=A0and Girnar mounta=\r\nins (Junagadh) in west India, Varanasi, Vrindavan and Hrishikesh in north I=\r\nndia and Srisailam and Mantralayam=C2=A0and Ujjain in central India.\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; There are many other good places, but the above come to my mind. Visi=\r\nting a temple once is one thing and staying there for several months while =\r\nmaintaining a simple lifestyle and doing a spiritual sadhana (like homam or=\r\n japam) there is quite another.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n&gt; Do a=\r\n Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Ta=\r\nrpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: h=\r\nttp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): =\r\nhttp://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): htt=\r\np://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ =\r\ngroup/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.Sri=\r\nJagan nath.org\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: Astro Seeker =\r\n\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 07, 2009 =\r\n9:11 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Holy Places\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Respected Na=\r\nrsimhaji, \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I would like to know your opinion on holy places (famous=\r\n temples etc) in today&#39;s time.
