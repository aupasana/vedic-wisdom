Suppose there is a mango tree in his backyard an=\r\nd he loves eating those mangoes. Suppose the mango season is upon him and h=\r\ne sees one raw mango. Suppose he fancies eating it when it ripens and gets =\r\nexcited by the thought.\n\nSuppose he dies then.

There is no o=\r\nther way.\n\nIf one gets carried away frequently by this and that thought, th=\r\nis and that desire and this and that fancy, one is unlikely to be desireles=\r\ns at the last moment.
