Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Whatever is one&#39;s path, Kundalini is not only awakened but goes t=\r\no Sahasrara \n&gt; &gt; &gt; when one is established in undifferentiated Self. Even i=\r\nf one does not think \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in those terms, it still happens. It is incorre=\r\nct to say that one can \n&gt; &gt; &gt; realize the highest truths without Kundalini =\r\nawakened. A more accurate \n&gt; &gt; &gt; statement would be that one can realize th=\r\ne highest truths without engaging \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in any specific practices geared a=\r\nt awakening or raising Kundalini.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some people following the so=\r\n-called &quot;Kundalini yoga&quot; or other raja/hatha \n&gt; &gt; &gt; yoga paths specifically=\r\n try to awaken Kundalini. However, such practices are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; not at all nee=\r\nded for awakening Kundalini. People belonging to various \n&gt; &gt; &gt; traditions =\r\nand paths, not just limited to Hinduism, can experience Kundalini \n&gt; &gt; &gt; aw=\r\nakening, without knowing anything about the name or the symbolism. There \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; are a lot of misconceptions about Kundalini.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *  =\r\n      *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kundalini is essentially the force of one&#39;s self-aware=\r\nness. Awakened and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; raised kundalini implies a more refined and highe=\r\nr self-awareness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; At the lowest level, we bind our selves to s=\r\npecific bodies and our \n&gt; &gt; &gt; self-awareness is limited to a body, a name a=\r\nnd other things associated with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the body and name. This experience o=\r\nf self as a body corresponds to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kundalini sleeping at Mooladhara. At=\r\n the highest level, we are the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; undifferentiated Self, known as Brahm=\r\nan, that is all-pervading. This \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;experience&#39; of self corresponds to =\r\nKundalini at Sahasrara. As \n&gt; &gt; &gt; self-awareness goes from the former to th=\r\ne latter, it may traverse through \n&gt; &gt; &gt; many stages in between. Correspond=\r\ningly, many experiences are possible.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kundalini rises as high as it can when it awakens for the first ti=\r\nme, like a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; spring suppressed for a long time. However, it comes down=\r\n again and the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; process of rise from then onwards will be slower, Kun=\r\ndalini will work its \n&gt; &gt; &gt; way up while the nadis are continuously cleaned=\r\n (i.e. undesirable \n&gt; &gt; &gt; conditioning of mind is cleaned). When Kundalini =\r\nrises high at the time of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; awakening, it may encounter impurities in =\r\nnadis and yet rise high through \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the impurities. This may manifest ph=\r\nysically as a powerful experience \n&gt; &gt; &gt; similar to heavy electricity flowi=\r\nng in the back.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There are thousands of nadis in the sookshma s=\r\nareera. The exact path taken \n&gt; &gt; &gt; by Kundalini as it rises for the first =\r\ntime is not fixed. It may change from \n&gt; &gt; &gt; person to person, based on the=\r\n impurities in various nadis. The exact \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;experience&quot; will vary depen=\r\nding on the path traversed and the final point \n&gt; &gt; &gt; reached by self-aware=\r\nness (kundalini), before withdrawal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I actually know one perso=\r\nn who had kundalini awakening, rise to Sahasrara \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and samadhi for 7 d=\r\nays, all happening at the same time. His nadis had \n&gt; &gt; &gt; already been puri=\r\nfied. Once kundalini awakened, he directly went into \n&gt; &gt; &gt; samadhi, stayed=\r\n there for 7 days and came back as a fully realized person. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But it i=\r\ns a much longer journey for most.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Saying &quot;this is what happens=\r\n in a Kundalini awakening&quot; is difficult. The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; exact experience change=\r\ns from person to person, depending on the path \n&gt; &gt; &gt; traversed the final p=\r\noint reached by Kundalini. However, I can say one thing \n&gt; &gt; &gt; confidently:=\r\n Once Kundalini truly awakens and rises, one will not have any \n&gt; &gt; &gt; confu=\r\nsion about what happened. But, until kundalini awakening occurs, one \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n may confuse various other experiences (such as some movement of vayu in \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; various nadis) for kundalini movement and wrongly think that kundalini=\r\n is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; awakened.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sensatio=\r\nn like ants or worms crawling along the spine or in the head are NOT \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n due to kundalini awakening or rise. That can be due to a little vaayu \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; flowing in various nadis. This can be a premonitory sign (but not a \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; guarantee) of kundalini awakening. Same thing can be said about the \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; sensation of tilting  to one side (back or left or right) or the sensati=\r\non \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of having completely fallen back (even though one is sitting norm=\r\nally in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; reality). There are several such premonitory signs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As a reference, I can narrate the exp=\r\nerience of ONE person. He was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; meditating with a Veda mantra everyday=\r\n. His guru had told him a few months \n&gt; &gt; &gt; earlier that his time for Kunda=\r\nlini awakening had come. However, he had \n&gt; &gt; &gt; absolutely no idea what kun=\r\ndalini was and was totally uninformed about \n&gt; &gt; &gt; nadis, chakras and kunda=\r\nlini. He did not engage in any specific raja/hatha \n&gt; &gt; &gt; yoga practices. A=\r\nll he did was to sit with his back erect and eyes closed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and meditat=\r\ne with a veda mantra. In the weeks before kundalini awakening, he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; st=\r\narted experiencing various premonitory signs. He guru told him not to be \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; distracted by them and to keep the focus on the mantra and try to forg=\r\net \n&gt; &gt; &gt; everything else. When mind starts dwelling on an experience, it g=\r\nets stuck \n&gt; &gt; &gt; there and cannot go higher.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When he was medit=\r\nating oneday, his mind was perfectly and intensely focused \n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the ma=\r\nntra and other thoughts ceased momentarily. Suddenly he became \n&gt; &gt; &gt; aware=\r\n of his body. It felt like there was a really tremendous explosion at \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; the base of his spine. Then it felt like a huge amount of electric curren=\r\nt \n&gt; &gt; &gt; was going up his spine from the base. Then it felt like he was not=\r\n a body \n&gt; &gt; &gt; but a small point. Then it felt like he was going up like a =\r\nrocket at a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; tremendous speed. Then it felt like there was a tremendo=\r\nusly bright white \n&gt; &gt; &gt; light and there was nothing else. It felt like he =\r\nwas not a small point in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that light, but he was the light itself. Th=\r\nere was an undescribable sense of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; peace and happiness. Suddenly, fro=\r\nm nowhere, a thought came &quot;what is this? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; What happened to my body? I=\r\n have responsibilities still.&quot; Then he became \n&gt; &gt; &gt; aware of himself as a =\r\nbody sitting in pooja room. When he left pooja room \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and went out, he=\r\n felt great love for everyone and happiness. For example, a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; serial w=\r\nas coming on TV and characters in the serial that he normally \n&gt; &gt; &gt; dislik=\r\ned for their shallow personalities suddenly felt like real people and \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; he had great love and compassion for those TV serial characters (and othe=\r\nr \n&gt; &gt; &gt; real people too). That state of love and compassion lasted a while=\r\n and then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; he was normal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This short experience was only=\r\n the beginning of a journey. He experienced \n&gt; &gt; &gt; many things later on. Th=\r\nese experiences were different from each other. As I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; said earlier, t=\r\nhe experience varies based on the path traversed and the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; point reach=\r\ned by the self-awareness (kundalini). On various occasions, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; kundalin=\r\ni rose and he saw several sights and several beings within and heard \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n several sounds, including veda mantras and beejaaksharas, again within.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He realized the transientness of a lot that we cling on to and t=\r\nhe existence \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of something far higher and more permanent.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; All this slowly started to change his attitude. His senses turned inwards=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and he critically started to analyze his own thoughts and motives a=\r\nnd worked \n&gt; &gt; &gt; on correcting his attitude. The impact of what was happeni=\r\nng around him, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; what others did and said started to make lesser and l=\r\nesser impact on him. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Luckily, he had a guru who put things in perspe=\r\nctive and said that kundalini \n&gt; &gt; &gt; awakening was just a beginning and the=\r\n real work was ahead. Depending on \n&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s readiness, that real work c=\r\nan take many many years or even lives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kundalini awakening is only a beginning. It is not an end. Even t=\r\nhe rise of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; kundalini to a chakra is not an end. In fact, a big perce=\r\nntage of people \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with awakened kundalini end up getting stuck at mool=\r\nadhara itself. Very few \n&gt; &gt; &gt; make it to the next chakra or the one after,=\r\n but end up getting stuck there. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Very very few make it to higher cha=\r\nkras. And a very small minority actually \n&gt; &gt; &gt; realise self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nComplete overcoming of ego and sthita prajnataa described by Sri Krishna in=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; BhagavadGita is the only real end goal of sadhana, whether you are =\r\ninto raja \n&gt; &gt; &gt; yoga or karma yoga or bhakti yoga or jnaana yoga. Thinking=\r\n of a mystical \n&gt; &gt; &gt; experience can only distract one from this goal. I ur=\r\nge sadhakas, especially \n&gt; &gt; &gt; those who respect my advice, to forget about=\r\n kundalini and chakras and just \n&gt; &gt; &gt; keep doing homam and japam (or whate=\r\nver path they have chosen), keep \n&gt; &gt; &gt; purifying themselves with sadhana, =\r\nkeep working on their attitude and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; thought process and keep improvin=\r\ng self-control. When (or as) mind becomes \n&gt; &gt; &gt; purified and one overcomes=\r\n ego, whatever needs to happen with kundalini WILL \n&gt; &gt; &gt; happen automatica=\r\nlly. Thinking of things in terms of kundalini and mystical \n&gt; &gt; &gt; experienc=\r\nes is a big deterrent rather than a boost, in one&#39;s spiritual \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhan=\r\na. Instead of trying to manipulate kundalini, try to manipulate the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nway your mind works and perfect your self-control. Kundalini will \n&gt; &gt; &gt; au=\r\ntomatically follow. One will do well to remember these words.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nBest regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Ved=\r\nicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedi=\r\nc-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.n=\r\net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak=\r\n@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Sunday, March 08, 2=\r\n009 3:30 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Urdhwa-Retas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Relevant to this on going subject, i remember rea=\r\nding autobiography of Shri \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yogeshwarji (Prakah na Panthe) in which h=\r\ne had mentioned that Kundalini \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Awakening is not mandatory for realiz=\r\nation.

When one attains a=\r\n perfect focus on a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantra and distracting thoughts cease, praan=\r\na moves downward from \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lungs/stomach and apaana moves upward. Aft=\r\ner praana and apaana combine, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they can move upward at a rapid sp=\r\need.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When praana and apaana combine for the first t=\r\nime, it may feel like an \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explosion within one. As praana moves u=\r\np, it will feel like one is freed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from the body and one does not=\r\n exist. This is similar to death, except \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that there is fear and =\r\nconfusion at death and one may feel a kind of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bliss when this ha=\r\nppens during meditation. However, if one&#39;s focus on \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantra relax=\r\nes and one become &quot;aware of&quot; the experience and starts \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; analyzing=\r\n it with the rational mind, there is a chance of one becoming \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wo=\r\nrried and confused. So one should sustain the state where there is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; full focus on mantra and no other distractions, for as long as possible.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These things happen automatically without thinking=\r\n about them and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; engaging in any specific practicies. In fact, th=\r\ninking about them, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desiring them and doing specific practices ma=\r\ny become an obstacle and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; delay things. If you surrender to a dei=\r\nty and do a mantra with a high \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; level of focus, that is enough. D=\r\no NOT run after any experience and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think of an experience as an =\r\nend result.

The deity&#39;s personality is cruc=\r\nial. Ugra \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; devatas make the person care almost for nothing himsel=\r\nf, so self \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; identification is minimised and the person&#39;s spiritua=\r\nl evolution \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; continues.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Remember, there is=C2 very litt=\r\nle=C2 according to me which is black magic. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is all a use of S=\r\nhakti. If your Shakti and deity is a higher shakti \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; such as Prach=\r\nand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your power \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will =\r\nbe that of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana). After the death \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; of the body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the deity or if he was \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; originally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm reserved for=\r\n these \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Attacking such a sadhak brings the full=\r\n bearing of karma onto the heads \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the attackers and some peopl=\r\ne may realise this to their detriment( \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Patan comes from Jalandha=\r\nr Nath burying the city of Patan with his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shakti causing an eart=\r\nhquake). Some people may even equate this with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; black magic. Here=\r\n there is only action and reaction.(Bit like you attack \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a normal=\r\n person, and you will get a result of this from that same Atma \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; w=\r\nhom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nsomebody who is identifying with the universe and has very few karmas \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; left, then the Universe itself attacks you, because your attack is no=\r\nt \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the sadhaka, but on his identification, ie God or the unive=\r\nrse).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If people persist in using the Shakti possesed by a small P=\r\nisacha, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhuta, then there is only a little Shakti which can be u=\r\nsed, moreover=C2 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then their minds and intellects will not be fre=\r\ne of identification with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the body and so their actions are those=\r\n which are generally termed as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; black magic. These people usually=\r\n join the same spirits which they have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been using after death, t=\r\nhis is not an enjoyable experience.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Imagine if somebody is worshi=\r\npping Chandika for a few lifetimes, then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; even in this birth he o=\r\nr she is drawn to that deity and such a sadhak \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may acheive after=\r\n a few repitions of a mantra(because of his previous \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; effort).\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On the other hand somebody doing this mantra only in this lifetime =\r\nmay \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feel that the 64 things which bind every mantra are crucial =\r\nand may not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; acheive in this lifetime.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; According to me =\r\nthe proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let me \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggest an =\r\neasy sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one is so inclined, then starting on some good d=\r\nay, do 1000 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reititions of the Savitri(some=C2 call this the=C2 G=\r\nayatri, but the real \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Gayatri is hidden) every day, main constrai=\r\nnts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same time every day.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same place.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same mat=\r\nerials.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same direction.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As little movement as one can.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Com=\r\nplete restraint on sex(from the mind and the body, not just the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nbody), reduce food intake, grow a beard.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do not eat 2 hrs before =\r\nyou start, make sure your bowels are empty \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before you start.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Continue this for 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 times.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; See the difference in your personality before and after.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lo=\r\nng and short , what is important is that life may be short, so do some \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana, and persist with that sadhana for as long as is physically =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies some of the concepts w=\r\nhich were being discussed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kind Love and Regards\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; manish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You may post this on the list as a clarification f=\r\nrom me if you feel \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that this is suitable.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
