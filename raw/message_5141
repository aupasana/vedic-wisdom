There are \nbound to =\r\nbe various perspectives and this may distract or confuse the initial \npract=\r\nitioner. Moreover the tyranny of over-intellectualization has to be kept in=\r\n \nmind. To any such reader my advice is- please follow what you are doing \n=\r\ncurrently. Things will evolve and happen on their own accord. Whatever is s=\r\nuited \nto you will happen in the natural flow of Life. \n\n\nIn this post I wi=\r\nll also touch upon certain other topics raised in some related \nposts while=\r\n primarily addressing Rajarshi ji&#39;s queries.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I had talked to a few peop=\r\nle who adhere to different paramparas &gt;&gt;&gt;within the \n&gt;&gt;&gt;broader subset of K=\r\nalikula. They said that the &gt;&gt;&gt;initiation in Chandi sadhana \n&gt;&gt;&gt;in required=\r\n for not only the parayana &gt;&gt;&gt;but also (mostly?) because of the main \n&gt;&gt;&gt;ma=\r\nntra. Normally we are &gt;&gt;&gt;accustomed with only the navarna mantra, but there=\r\n \n&gt;&gt;&gt;are various &gt;&gt;&gt;other mantras of the different aspects of the Universal=\r\n Chandi, \n&gt;&gt;&gt;of &gt;&gt;&gt;which the navarna we know of, is probably the mildest. T=\r\no chant &gt;&gt;&gt;one of \n&gt;&gt;&gt;these mantras and awaken the same needs initiation. T=\r\nhis, &gt;&gt;&gt;they said, is a \n&gt;&gt;&gt;part of the &gt;&gt;&gt;entire Chandi sadhana. What is y=\r\nour &gt;&gt;opinion on this?&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nBroadly speaking most of the above is true from =\r\nthe traditional *Sakta* \nperspective. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana as enjoined by=\r\n Kalikula emphasises MANTRA \nsadhana. Merely chanting the Devi Mahatmyam te=\r\nxt is not the same as Sri Sri \nChandi sadhana, as per this view. It has var=\r\nious mantric nuances and practices \nincluding other mantras and bijas and w=\r\nays to make them work. I will expand on \nthis at the end of this post after=\r\n addressing your other points.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;As a corollary to your above paragraph, =\r\none can therefore read the &gt;&gt;&gt;text of \n&gt;&gt;&gt;the Chandi in a pouranik approach=\r\n, as a sacred myth? There &gt;&gt;&gt;are people, \n&gt;&gt;&gt;specially in Bengal, who do a =\r\nChandipath on their own &gt;&gt;&gt;without having \n&gt;&gt;&gt;undergone any formal initiati=\r\non. How good or bad is &gt;&gt;&gt;this practise?\n\nAs always there will be varied be=\r\nliefs and opinions ranging from the very rigid \ntraditional extreme to the =\r\nvery liberal and casual new-age extreme based on \none&#39;s personal affiliatio=\r\nns, family and cultural influences. I will speak for \n*myself*. I prefer th=\r\ne moderate view that is respectful to tradition but does \nnot allow traditi=\r\non to be one more fetter. \n\n\nQuite often many of our beliefs are fear-based=\r\n rather than knowledge-based. \nHowever undigested, unassimilated and unharm=\r\nonised information gathered from the \ninternet or even the print media is n=\r\not knowledge. There is no need to be \nfearful as long as one is not experim=\r\nenting with mantramarga based on fragmented \ninformation gathered from book=\r\ns or worse still the internet. As long as one does \nthe parayana along with=\r\n other supportive practices such as kirtan, swadhyaya, \nreflection and bhak=\r\nti bhava, initiation need not be a binding factor. However if \none wishes t=\r\no do Sri Sri Chandi sadhana in a full-fledged manner as per the \ntraditiona=\r\nl Sakta perspective, better be initiated. If one strongly wills it \n(sankal=\r\npa) and is suited to it, the external guru and initiation will happen on \nt=\r\nheir own accord. For the rest who are not predominantly suited to or inclin=\r\ned \ntowards mantramarga, this discussion is not relevant. \n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;There &gt;&gt;&gt;ar=\r\ne people, specially in Bengal, who do a Chandipath on &gt;&gt;&gt;their own \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;w=\r\nithout having undergone any formal initiation. How &gt;&gt;&gt;good or bad is &gt;&gt;&gt;thi=\r\ns \n&gt;&gt;&gt;practise?\n\nBengal is one of the areas of the subcontinent where Kalik=\r\nula flourished in a \nfull-fledged manner at one time. So at the collective =\r\nlevel Kalikula is deeply \nembedded in the collective unconscious and thereb=\r\ny the tendency to do Chandipath \nirrespective of initiation. To undertand t=\r\nhis one needs to appreciate the \ndynamics between Kundalini and *KULA* KUND=\r\nALINII which are akin to the \nindividual unconscious and collective unconsc=\r\nious. If a particular \nfamily/significant member of the family has practice=\r\nd the sadhana of a devata \nfor sometime, the descendants automatically have=\r\n its influence in their \nunconscious. That is why we are advised to worship=\r\n the kuladevata along with \nishta devata though ishta devata remains a majo=\r\nr focus. The same applies to \nparayana too. Bengal was at one time a hotbed=\r\n for the living and breathing \ntradition of Kalikula. Though we do not see =\r\nits flowering at the same level or \nin the same form today, at the unseen a=\r\nnd unconscious collective level, the \nage-old Kalikula is very much alive a=\r\nnd breathing. \n\n\nSpiritual life is all about Awareness and oversimplifying =\r\nit further, making the \nunconscious conscious is what Awareness is about. I=\r\nn true Advaitic fashion the \ncollective and individual consciousness are no=\r\nt separate. The advent of Sri \nRamakrishna is a predictable culmination of =\r\nthe flowering of Kalikula at a \ncollective level. His advent marks a major =\r\nmilestone in not just Kalikula \nsadhana but Sakta sadhana itself. Irrespect=\r\nive of the physical death of Sri \nRamakrishna, his satsangha is possible fo=\r\nr all sincere seekers. Whilst swadhyaya \nof the Kathamrta is the easiest wa=\r\ny to revel in his Satsangha, it is possible to \nconnect with him through a =\r\ncombination of trust (sraddha) and sense of \nbelongingness too. If you cons=\r\nider him as your APTA, he automatically becomes \nyour apta at a manasik lev=\r\nel. This sense of belongingness straightaway opens the \ndoors of your heart=\r\n and makes his grace and protection possible. \n\n\nIn view of the above discu=\r\nssed factors, it might be okay to do Chandi parayana \nwithout initiation, i=\r\nn our times. Initiation could happen in the long run if it \nis meant to be.=\r\n However traditionally speaking Sri Sri Chandipath without \ninitiation is u=\r\nnimaginable as Sri Sri Chandi&#39;s integrated sadhana includes \nvarious other =\r\nmantras and bijas that are generally not written in texts though \nsome text=\r\ns talk about them without giving the complete details. Diksha includes \nall=\r\n this and much more. Here a word on `diksha&#39; itself is in order to clarify =\r\n\nthe difference between uninitiated Devi Mahatmya parayana and initiated Sr=\r\ni Sri \nChandi sadhana. \n\n\nDiksha differs in accordance with the sampradaya =\r\nor the lineage within Kalikula \nor Srikula. To understand `diksha&#39; itself, =\r\none needs to examine certain \ndifferences (bhedas), of which the following =\r\nare most important:\n\n1. Guru Parampara: This forms the core of Devi Upasana=\r\n and the other bhedas \n(differences) are in a way based on this.\n\n2. Sampra=\r\ndaya: Guru of any authentic lineage should necessarily belong to one of \nth=\r\ne recognized sampradayas. \n\n\n3. Diksha: Depending on the disciple&#39;s eligibi=\r\nlity and the Guru&#39;s capability, \nthe type of diksha too varies. \n\n\n4. Yaga =\r\nBheda: There are four levels of Yajna or yaga - Antaryaga, \nBahiryaga,Mahay=\r\naga and Rahoyaga. Guru initiates the disciple into one or more of \nthese pa=\r\nths depending on the adhikara (aptitudes, needs and capabilities) of the \ns=\r\nadhaka. Only antaryaga and bahiryaga are relevant to our discussion. I have=\r\n \nalready expanded on this in another post on Yajna. \n\n\n5. Devata Bheda: Th=\r\nough the Devi is only One, depending on the samskara and \nvasana of the ini=\r\ntiate, he is initiated into the worship of Kali or Sri and thus \nthe paths =\r\nof Kalikula and Srikula or Kalividya and Srividya. \n\n\n6. Achara Bheda: Depe=\r\nnding on the initiate&#39;s samskara and adhikara, broadly \nspeaking there are =\r\nseven acharas- Vedachara, Vaisnavachara, Saivachara, \nDakshinachara, Vamach=\r\nara, Siddhantachara , and Kaulachara. Within the framework \nof Sakta sadhan=\r\na, there are only three acharas- Samaya, Dakshina and Kaulachara. \nIt is hi=\r\nghly misleading to speak of the *superiority* of one achara over the \nother=\r\n. The path, the chosen form of the Mother (Kali or Sri), the means of \nwors=\r\nhip, are all differently devised to suit the varying temperaments of the \np=\r\nractitioners. All forms of the Devi and all paths of sadhana are equally \nr=\r\nespectable and ancient enough. The differences pertain more to the practiti=\r\noner \nand NOT TO THE DIVINITY. As such we are advised not to degrade or cri=\r\nticize any \npath or deity. All upasanas lead to the Devi and all sadhakas h=\r\nave the Devi \nwithin them. To talk lowly of any other sadhana marga or rupa=\r\n of the Devi \namounts to insulting the Devi Herself. As Sri Bhaskararaya ob=\r\nserves with \ncharacteristic tolerance, &quot;all vidyas are not different, a com=\r\nparison of one to \nanother (in the texts) is merely for the sake of praisin=\r\ng and encouraging its \nperformance&quot;. One could as well extend this toleranc=\r\ne (if not acceptance) to all \nforms of God and all paths of attaining Her/H=\r\nim. In the ultimate reckoning, any \ndivision is relative as there is only t=\r\nhe ONE. Advaita is the true essence of \nSakta sadhana. All paths are practi=\r\ncally along a *circular* continuum. An \nintellectual debate on the differen=\r\nces between various paths is irrelevant to \nsadhana itself though it has re=\r\nlevance to academicians or to the respective \nworld-view of the sadhaka. In=\r\nstead sadhakas should focus on the underlying unity \nof all paths and the u=\r\nltimate Oneness of all forms of the Divine. This is a \nmajor tenet of Sakta=\r\n sadhana.\n\n7. Mantra Bheda =E2=80=93 Based on certain factors including the=\r\n sadhaka&#39;s adhikara \nbheda, he is initiated into a different mantra. It is =\r\nnot uncommon that the same \nsadhaka is initiated into various forms of the =\r\nmantra progressively in a gradual \nmanner if he persists with commitment. F=\r\nor instance in Sri Vidya upasana the \nmantra of Sri has five variant versio=\r\nns- Bala, Panchadashi, Shodashi, Para \nshodashi and Guhya shodashi. Bala ma=\r\nntra is the entry level or preparatory level \nmantra for Sri Vidya. Likewis=\r\ne the navakshari or navarna mantra too has SEVEN \nVARIANT versions, of whic=\r\nh the Navarna mantra that most written texts include is \nthe mildest and ak=\r\nin to the entry level Bala mantra in Sri Vidya upasana. \n\n\nThe *details* of=\r\n the seven variant versions of the navakshari or the twelve \ndifferent ways=\r\n of doing Sri Sri Chandi path are really unnecessary to our \ncurrent discus=\r\nsion. Instead in my next post I will write more on MANTRA and its \ncentral =\r\nimportance in sadhana as per the Sakta world-view. \n\n\nFinally a word on `Va=\r\nk and `artha&#39; too is in order here. It is true that one \nderives great bene=\r\nfit by chanting a mantra in its original form. No doubt \ntranslation of a m=\r\nantra is NOT the same as the mantra in its original form as \n`vak&#39;. Undoubt=\r\nedly `Sabda&#39; comes first and then only the `artha&#39; follows (&quot;Artha \nSrishta=\r\neh Purvam Sabda srushtih&quot;). However one has to bear in mind that `Vak&#39; \nand=\r\n `Artha&#39; are interdependent and inseparable. I will elaborate on \nSabda/Vak=\r\n/Artha in my next post along with Sri Bhaskararaya makhin&#39;s commentary \nand=\r\n the importance accorded to the fifteen levels of meaning (artha) of a \nman=\r\ntra, so much so that he even affirms that, &quot;the mere utterance of sabda \nwi=\r\nthout a knowledge of the true import bears no fruit, even as the offering \n=\r\nthrown over ashes in the absence of fire does not burst into flame&quot;. I will=\r\n \nexamine both sides of `sabda&#39; and `artha&#39; in my next post as and when I c=\r\nan. All \nIndian traditions that explore `Vak&#39; or `Sabda&#39; agree that both ar=\r\ne inseparable. \nThe very mention of the words `sabda&#39; and `artha&#39; brings to=\r\n my mind the most \nbeautiful mangala sloka from Kalidasa&#39;s `Raghuvamsa&#39; whe=\r\nrein he compares the \ninseparable and interdependent nature of `Vak&#39; and `A=\r\nrtha&#39; to `Siva&#39; and `Sakti&#39; \nthe parents of the entire universe =E2=80=A6.\n=\r\n\nvagarthaviva samprkthau vagarthaaprathipaththaye / \njagathaha pitharau van=\r\ndhe parvathiparameshvarau // \n\nRegards,\nSatya Prakash\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Satya Prak=\r\nash ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for your beautiful=C3=82=C2=A0analysis of Sri Sri Ch=\r\nandi.

It is this particular approach that needs initiation as per =\r\n\n&gt; its own principles. Initiation is not mandatory if one adopts the Vedant=\r\nic path \n&gt;\n&gt; of Viveka and Vichara, or the Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairag=\r\nya, or even the \n&gt; Pauranic approach of reading the text devoutly as Sacred=\r\n Myth. Likewise Homam \n&gt; too is not required if one is not inclined to the =\r\npredominantly Vaidik practice \n&gt;\n&gt; of Ritual/Yagnya. One may benefit from a=\r\nny or all of these approaches to Sri \n&gt;Sri \n&gt;\n&gt; Chandi. However one has to =\r\nbear in mind that the living and breathing \n&gt;traditions \n&gt;\n&gt; of both Kaliku=\r\nla as well as Srikula as practiced originally in various parts of \n&gt;\n&gt; the =\r\nsubcontinent originally trace themselves to Tantra marga and hence the \n&gt; i=\r\nmportance of initiation for those paths, be it Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 1) I had talked to a few people who adhere to different parampar=\r\nas within the \n&gt; broader subset of Kalikula. They said that the initiation =\r\nin Chandi sadhana in \n\n&gt; required for not only the parayana but also (mostl=\r\ny?) because of the main \n&gt; mantra. Normally we are accustomed with only the=\r\n navarna mantra, but there are \n\n&gt; various other mantras of the different a=\r\nspects of the Universal Chandi, of \n&gt;which \n&gt;\n&gt; the navarna we know of, is =\r\nprobably the mildest. To chant one of these mantras \n\n&gt; and awaken the same=\r\n needs initiation. This, they said, is a part of the entire \n\n&gt; Chandi sadh=\r\nana.=C3=82=C2=A0What=C3=82=C2=A0is your opinion on this?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) As a corol=\r\nlary to your above paragraph, one can therefore read the text of \n&gt; the Cha=\r\nndi in a pouranik approach, as a sacred myth? There are people, \n&gt;specially=\r\n \n&gt;\n&gt; in Bengal, who do a Chandipath on their own without having undergone =\r\nany formal \n&gt;\n&gt; initiation.

I will address it after summarizing the big picture that needs t=\r\no \n&gt;be \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;invoked in order to understand the ONE question and the MANY a=\r\nnswers possible. \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Firstly is the question a general or specific one? G=\r\nenerally speaking if the \n&gt; &gt;question is whether initiation is an absolute =\r\nrequirement for spiritual life \n&gt;or \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;sadhana, *my* answer is- NO. Howe=\r\nver if the question is about the necessity of \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;being initiated for man=\r\ntra sadhana as enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the answer \n&gt;is \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;YES.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &#39;Munde munde matir bhinna&#39; as the tantric adage goes; thereby the neces=\r\nsity \n&gt;for \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;multiple approaches and multiple paths. Thus arises the in=\r\nevitability of \n&gt; &gt;multiple perspectives. In the pan-Indian context there a=\r\nre many paths for \n&gt; &gt;sadhana. But in the current context of this question =\r\nI will restrict myself to \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;only the five that are relevant to the disc=\r\nussion.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; a. Gnana marga (Advaitic/Vedantic)\n&gt; &gt; b. Yoga marga (Psyc=\r\nho-spiritual)\n&gt; &gt; c. Mantra marga (Tantric)\n&gt; &gt; d. Bhakti marga (Love/Devot=\r\nion)\n&gt; &gt; e. Karma marga (Action- Ritual path and/or Selfless Actions)\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Spiritual life is nothing but the practicalisation of the great abstrac=\r\nt \n&gt;Truths \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;of the Cosmos. Each of the above paths EMPHASISES particul=\r\nar methods and \n&gt; &gt;techniques in its attempt to practicalise the abstract t=\r\nruths at an \n&gt;experiential \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;level. Let us briefly look at the predomin=\r\nant methods/ techniques employed by \n\n&gt; &gt;each of these paths.\n&gt; &gt; For those=\r\n who are predominantly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking \n\n&gt; &gt;ev=\r\nen the external guru is not necessary, though one can greatly benefit from =\r\n\n&gt;the \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;wisdom and experience of a genuine teacher. The direct path of =\r\nAdvaita \n&gt; &gt;emphasises the methods of Viveka (Discernment) and Vichara (sel=\r\nf-reflection). \n\n&gt; &gt;Advaita being essentially a culmination of the Vaidik s=\r\nystem it has retained \n&gt;the \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;vaidik practice of &#39;Swadhyaya&#39; (regular s=\r\nelf-study of texts) too as an \n&gt;important \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;practice. All of these prac=\r\ntices involve the &#39;self&#39; in a big way with a \n&gt;marginal \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;role for exte=\r\nrnal practices.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yoga marga emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching by co=\r\nnsistent practice) and \n&gt; &gt;Vairagya (Non-reactivity or Non-attachment). Hin=\r\ndu schools of Yoga \n&gt;additionally \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;emphasise &#39;Iswarapranidhana&#39; (orien=\r\nting oneself towards the Supreme Iswara) \n&gt;too \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;while Bauddha and Jina=\r\n schools of Yogamarga emphasise only the first two as \n&gt;they \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;subscrib=\r\ne to nirishwaravada.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion) emphasises uncon=\r\nditional acceptance of Iswara&#39;s \n\n&gt; &gt;will through total surrender to the Su=\r\npreme. On the contrary the emphasis in \n&gt; &gt;Karma marga is on Action as advo=\r\ncated by the Bhagavad Gita. Engaging in \n&gt;actions \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;without attachment =\r\nto the results is the mainstay of Karma marga of the Gita.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Finally=\r\n I will address the Tantric path of mantra sadhana where alone the \n&gt; &gt;inev=\r\nitable necessity of initiation and thereby the necessity of a Guru arises. =\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Mantra sadhana involves the practicalization of certain occult truths=\r\n via the \n\n&gt; &gt;energetics of Sabda through the employment of Vak. It presupp=\r\noses certain \n&gt; &gt;dangers inherent to any lab experiment and thereby certain=\r\n regulations and \n&gt;safe \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;practices. It should be remembered that excep=\r\nt Bhakti marga most paths invoke \n\n&gt; &gt;Fire or Agni at various levels, while=\r\n Bhakti predominantly invokes Soma (the \n&gt; &gt;reference here is to the age-ol=\r\nd `Agni-Someeyam&#39;). Among the paths that invoke \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Agni, one path invoke=\r\ns/employs the fire of the intellect, another the fire of \n\n&gt; &gt;speech, anoth=\r\ner the fire of austerity, and yet another the physical fire of \n&gt;the \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\nYagnya and so on.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tantra&#39;s method of invoking fire deals with the =\r\nfire of Vak through the \n&gt; &gt;lab-like practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra e=\r\nmploys highly powerful \n&gt;techniques \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;that bring results more quickly i=\r\nt lays great emphasis on adhikara. Adhikara \n&gt;is \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;not about authority =\r\nbut more about qualification. Would you allow a child to \n&gt; &gt;experiment wit=\r\nh fire without any supervision? Does the supervisor need \n&gt; &gt;experience and=\r\n training or not? Like any other lab experiment proper training \n\n&gt; &gt;and ex=\r\nperience are part of the procedure apart from certain safety measures, \n&gt;in=\r\n \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;the Tantric lab experiment too. However the lab is one&#39;s own conscio=\r\nusness \n&gt; &gt;whilst the experiment is awakening the Sakti within the individu=\r\nal \n&gt;consciousness \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;(also referred to as Kundalini Sakti). As this is =\r\nnot a topic for mere \n&gt; &gt;intellectualisation, I will refrain from further d=\r\niscussion on the Kundalini. \n\n&gt; &gt;Without going into other needless details =\r\nhere, I will just elaborate on \n&gt; &gt;initiation and Guru parampara.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nSince we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to contextualise it with=\r\nin \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;the larger Tantric context too. Sakti sadhana is one major river w=\r\nithin the \n&gt; &gt;Tantric context. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta=\r\n sadhanas \n&gt; &gt;comprehensively. However there are actually three major schoo=\r\nls that are \n&gt; &gt;full-fledged living traditions among the DashaMahaVidyas- K=\r\nalikula, Srikula \n&gt;and \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana belongs to Ka=\r\nlikula whilst Sri Vidya sadhana \n\n&gt; &gt;belongs to Srikula. Just to make the p=\r\nicture more complete the Vajrayanas \n&gt;among \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;the Buddhists (!) have ta=\r\nken to Tarakula. To those who are familiar with \n&gt;Tibetan \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Buddhism I =\r\nwill draw attention to the the 21 forms of Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;s=\r\nhares both the Advaitic outlook as well as the Sakta sadhanas in its approa=\r\nch \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;to sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not t=\r\nhat Soma is not invoked at all) \n\n&gt; &gt;while Sri kula predominantly invokes S=\r\noma, at least at the major milestones in \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;the internal spiritual journ=\r\ney. The yantra, mantra, bija, devata, etc are all \n\n&gt; &gt;consistently of a pa=\r\nrticular set of synchronistic frequencies for each of \n&gt;these \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;three l=\r\nineages. Initiation is the full-fledged entry of the practitioner into \n&gt;a =\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;particular spiritual lineage of that path (kula). The Guru parampara =\r\ncan be \n&gt; &gt;compared to an INVERTED TREE with SIVA himself at the root from =\r\nwhere the \n&gt;trunk \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;arises. Each branch and sub-branches and twigs spre=\r\nad out progressively \n&gt;downward \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;till the individual sadhaka. It is a =\r\nbeautiful metaphor if you can visualise \n&gt;it. \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Another modern metaphor=\r\n that one can use is that of electricity. It is held by \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;the Tantric a=\r\ndvocate that initiation not only completes the circuit necessary \n\n&gt; &gt;for t=\r\nhe conduit of electricity but also prevents short circuit. Imagine many \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;beautiful bulbs/lights at each point in this inverted tree of live wires, =\r\n\n&gt;where \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;there is a long series of sadhakas sitting in silent practice=\r\n all the way up \n&gt; &gt;till Siva himself. It is a dynamic world of Light (Prak=\r\nasa) and Sound (Sabda). \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As alrea=\r\ndy stated Sakta sadhana seeks to awaken Sakti within the individual \n&gt; &gt;con=\r\nsciousness through an integrated approach that combines the practices of \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and Mantra. Both Kalikula and Srikula have evo=\r\nlved \n\n&gt; &gt;into highly comprehensive and integrated approaches that can simu=\r\nltaneously \n&gt;hold \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;the many in the One. Sri Sri Chandi seemingly start=\r\ns with the Pauranic \n&gt;approach. \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;However it is also a full-fledged Adv=\r\naitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads. \n&gt;It \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;is also simultaneously =\r\na text on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. The \n&gt; &gt;question of initiatio=\r\nn is relevant only to those following the Tantramarga and \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;thus employ=\r\ning the text as a mantramaya text . For those who explore the text \n&gt;as \n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;a yogasastra, the esoteric meaning is more relevant which I have covered=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;extensively in my write-up. For those who are already inclined to the =\r\nAdvaitic \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;path, Sri Sri Chandi provides the context for immensely powe=\r\nrful reflections \n&gt; &gt;through its central message of Oneness. The crest jewe=\r\nl, the crowning glory in \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;the text is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi H=\r\nerself proclaims in full-fledged \n&gt; &gt;Upanishadic fashion that She is one wi=\r\nthout a second, saying &quot;I alone exist in \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;this universe. Who else is t=\r\nhere besides me?&quot; (10.5). Compare it with the \n&gt;other \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Mahavakyas of t=\r\nhe Upanishads and reflect on the central truth of Advaita.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The rea=\r\nson I advised the non-initiate to read in English or any other \n&gt;regional \n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;language is because understanding the meaning and constant reflection =\r\nare \n&gt; &gt;possible only when one repeatedly reads the text in a language that=\r\n they can \n&gt; &gt;fully follow. The main idea of the writeup is to explore the =\r\ntext as an \n&gt;Advaitic \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;and Yogic text too apart from its obvious statu=\r\ns as Sacred myth. However Sri \n&gt;Sri \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Chandi is also equally regarded a=\r\ns Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especially \n\n&gt; &gt;the four hymns. In that r=\r\negard all the applications of Veda mantras or the \n&gt;Veda \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Samhita are =\r\nequally possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the practice of \n&gt; &gt;Chandi *=\r\nHOMAM*. Anyone who is acquainted with the original Vedic method will \n&gt; &gt;st=\r\nraightaway identify that Yagnya is the central Vedic practice. In fact even=\r\n \n\n&gt; &gt;the worship of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully based on and =\r\nDERIVED \n&gt; &gt;from a one on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with the Hindu =\r\ntemple.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Just as some practitioners do the Homam as an integral par=\r\nt of Sri Sri Chandi \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;sadhana in accordance with the Vedic approach, th=\r\nere are those who adhere to \n&gt;the \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Tantric approach and do the sadhana=\r\n as per the mantra marga. It is this \n&gt; &gt;particular approach that needs ini=\r\ntiation as per its own principles. \n&gt;Initiation \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;is not mandatory if o=\r\nne adopts the Vedantic path of Viveka and Vichara, or the \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Yogic path =\r\nof Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even the Pauranic approach of reading \n&gt;the \n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise Homam too is not required if one =\r\nis not \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;inclined to the predominantly Vaidik practice of Ritual/Yagnya=\r\n. One may \n&gt;benefit \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;from any or all of these approaches to Sri Sri Ch=\r\nandi. However one has to bear \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;in mind that the living and breathing t=\r\nraditions of both Kalikula as well as \n&gt; &gt;Srikula as practiced originally i=\r\nn various parts of the subcontinent \n&gt;originally \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;trace themselves to =\r\nTantra marga and hence the importance of initiation for \n&gt; &gt;those paths, be=\r\n it Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In summary, one can make spiritua=\r\nl progress through any of the \n&gt; &gt;merthods/practices using Sri Sri Chandi. =\r\nSwadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara, \n&gt; &gt;Iswarapranidhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitt=\r\na bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa etc are \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;all effective. However depending =\r\non the individual temperament, aptitude etc., \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;some of these methods a=\r\nre more suited relatively to different practitioners. \n&gt;One \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;may progr=\r\ness through a combination of any of these methods in spiritual life. \n\n&gt; &gt;H=\r\nowever the *full-fledged* integrated approach of KALIKULA involves Mantra \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;diksha too. It is this big picture against which the answer to the quest=\r\nion \n&gt;has \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;to be contextualised.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Finally one last word. Irres=\r\npective of the method and path, SWADHYAYA and \n&gt; &gt;SATSANGHA are the most ef=\r\nfective methods for all of us. Swadhyaya is regular \n&gt; &gt;self-study of texts=\r\n followed by reflection on the truths expounded in the \n&gt;texts. \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;This =\r\nis best done in a language that one is fully conversant with. As for \n&gt; &gt;SA=\r\nTSANGHA it is the FIRST AND BEST choice among all methods. Swadhyaya is the=\r\n \n\n&gt; &gt;alternate method (though not as powerful) where Satsangha is not poss=\r\nible. It \n&gt;is \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Satsangha and satsangha alone that enables one to make =\r\nrapid progress in \n&gt; &gt;spiritual life. Sri Ramakrishna attained the rare exa=\r\nlted state by virtue of \n&gt; &gt;serving, listening to and spending time in the =\r\ncompany of sadhus and sants in \n\n&gt; &gt;his younger days. Vivekananda , Jnanade=\r\nva and Gorakhnath made a quantum leap \n&gt;in \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;their spiritual lives afte=\r\nr they attended the Satsangha of Ramakrishna, \n&gt; &gt;Nivrittinath and Matsyend=\r\nranath respectively.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For those who complain about the scarcity of =\r\nSatsangha nowadays, I will just \n\n&gt; &gt;quote Swami Sivananda:\n&gt; &gt; QUOTE // &quot;T=\r\nhere is a complaint by householders nowadays that there are no \n&gt;good \n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;Mahatmas. This is a lame excuse. The company of Sadhus is a question of su=\r\npply \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;and demand. If there is a sincere demand, the supply will come a=\r\nt once. This \n&gt;is \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;the inexorable law of nature. If you are really thi=\r\nrsty, you will find your \n&gt; &gt;Master at your threshold. You lead a happy-go-=\r\nlucky life, your mind is full of \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;passion and unholy Vasanas. You do n=\r\not care a bit for higher divine life. You \n\n&gt; &gt;waste your time in idle goss=\r\niping and vain, worldly talks. You have become a \n&gt; &gt;hopeless slave of pass=\r\nion, greed, and name and fame. And yet you complain: `I \n\n&gt; &gt;cannot get goo=\r\nd Satsanga.&#39;... Make yourself a deserving Adhikari first. Then \n&gt; &gt;come to =\r\nme. I shall take you to the lotus-feet of blessed souls who will put \n&gt;you =\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;in the right path, guide you and elevate you to sublime heights. Thes=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt;&quot;oversouls&quot; or high souls are waiting to get hold of the right type o=\r\nf \n&gt; &gt;aspirants. Mahatmas are in plenty. Real seekers are few. If you bring=\r\n a \n&gt;charge, \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&quot;There are no good Mahatmas.&quot; Mahatmas also bring a seri=\r\nous charge, &quot;There are \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;no real seekers after Truth.&quot;.&quot; //UNQUOTE\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; To a certain extent even this forum is an opportunity for Satsangha. \n=\r\n&gt;Conducted \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;with the appropriate bhavana, this group too is a potentia=\r\nl Satsangha though \n&gt;not \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;comparable to the actual company of the grea=\r\nt masters. By swadhyaya of Sri Sri \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Chandi as a yoga-vedantic text alo=\r\nngside a study of the lives of great Saktas \n\n&gt; &gt;such as Sri Ramakrishna Pa=\r\nramahamsa, by listening and/or singing the uplifting \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;kirtans/chants l=\r\nauding the Mother, by constant remembrance and reflection, by \n\n&gt; &gt;discernm=\r\nent of sat and asat, by genuine and sincere discussions on a group \n&gt;such \n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;as this, one makes progress truly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I may not interact regular=\r\nly or reply at least for a while. However I might \n&gt; &gt;participate in some d=\r\niscussions on and off.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Satya Prakash\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Namaste everybody,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I read this message of respected Narasi=\r\nmha Garu few times.

However=\r\n, one without a rich father is still better off opening a \n&gt;bank \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;acco=\r\nunt with a zero balance and building it up slowly with one&#39;s own hard \n&gt;wor=\r\nk. \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Similarly, one not finding a guru can still do sadhana with famous=\r\n mantras and \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;build one&#39;s own spiritual account. If you find a guru to=\r\n initiate you (not as \n&gt;a \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;formality, but truly initiate you), get ini=\r\ntiated. Otherwise, just go ahead \n&gt;and \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;do it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2b) Ma=\r\nntras and rituals are used for two purposes - (i) for getting \n&gt; &gt;specific =\r\nmaterial results and (ii) as tools of increasing surrender and making \n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;spiritual progress. In the case of (ii), initiation is not that important.=\r\n \n&gt;But, \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;in the case of (i), there are pitfalls and a guru can prepare=\r\n one \n&gt;sufficiently. \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;One can get in trouble otherwise.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; However, as I said several times, there are very few people who can do \n&gt;=\r\n(i) \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;now-a-days. Nature has destabilized the whole system, for a reaso=\r\nn, as Kali \n&gt; &gt;progressed. I suggest doing mantras and rituals only for inc=\r\nreasing surrender, \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;getting whatever material results god wants to giv=\r\ne and making spiritual \n&gt; &gt;progress. If one is meant to do rituals for bege=\r\ntting *specific* material \n&gt; &gt;results (for oneself or others or society/uni=\r\nverse in general), Nature will \n&gt;make \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;arrangements for one to get cor=\r\nrect knowledge of such rituals. But, as one \n&gt; &gt;starts, one should start wi=\r\nth the attitude of (ii).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If you want to do Chandipath o=\r\nr any mantra or any ritual or any \n&gt;homam, \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;do it with the attitude of=\r\n &quot;I have several material desires, but I do not know \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;how to fulfil th=\r\nem. Because of this ritual, god may give any material results \n&gt;or \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;sp=\r\niritual results and not necessarily fulfil my desires. I will accept \n&gt;what=\r\never \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;god gives. I want to increase my devotion and surrender and make=\r\n spiritual \n&gt; &gt;progress&quot;. You are then SAFE. Initiation is not required. Th=\r\nat attitude itself \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;is an initiation!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (4) Gentle deiti=\r\nes give good results slowly, but there are fewer hiccups. \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Fierce deit=\r\nies give results fast, but there may be some hiccups. I gave this \n&gt; &gt;analo=\r\ngy earlier also. Imagine that a person is taking rotten fruits from a \n&gt;fru=\r\nit \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;basket and throwing them in garbage and trying to retrieve one goo=\r\nd fruit from \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;under them. If the person is gentle, one may do it gentl=\r\ny and the spillage of \n\n&gt; &gt;rotten fruits on the floor will be minimal. If t=\r\nhe person is aggressive, one \n&gt;may \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;do it fast and there may be more s=\r\npillage of rotten fruits on the floor. But \n&gt;the \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;good fruit stuck und=\r\ner the rotten fruits will be retrieved faster. Similarly, \n\n&gt; &gt;phala of you=\r\nr karmas is in a basket. The deity is trying to take bad fruits \n&gt;and \n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;throw them in garbage and give you a good fruit to eat. There may be some =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;spillage. A gentle deity like Ganapathi, Vishnu or Lakshmi may take mor=\r\ne time \n&gt;to \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;get out the good fruit, but the spillage will be minimal.=\r\n A fierce deity like \n\n&gt; &gt;Chandi or Bhairava or Kali or Narasimha may have =\r\nmore spillage, but the good \n&gt; &gt;fruit comes out faster.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At =\r\nthe end, remember that these fruits are not deity&#39;s creations, but \n&gt; &gt;frui=\r\nts of your own actions. Without sadhana, you would&#39;ve had to eat each of \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;those rotten fruits before eating the good fruits!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nevert=\r\nheless, one unable to take some of the spillage of rotten fruits is \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;b=\r\netter off avoiding fierce deities such as Chandi and staying with gentler \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;deities. If initiation if made mandatory, one can be assessed by a guru =\r\nbefore \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;starting a practice. If you realize the above, you can start m=\r\nantras without \n&gt; &gt;initiation. If some bad results occut, you have to reali=\r\nze that it is a fruit \n&gt;of \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;your own actions and the deity is trying t=\r\no accelerate good results. If you \n&gt;are \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;weak-hearted, stick to gentle=\r\nr deities.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (5) Some people who never lit a lamp in their li=\r\nfe and were ignorant of \n&gt; &gt;rituals, are doing daily homam now. Some people=\r\n who took several hours to read \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Saptashati for the first time just 2-=\r\n3 years back are now doing Chandi homam \n&gt; &gt;with entire saptashati everyday=\r\n. I know that some of them have transformed a \n&gt;lot \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;and have experien=\r\nced some things too. Obviously, they have done sadhana with \n&gt; &gt;fire and sa=\r\ndhana of the Fierce aspects of Divine Mother in some past lives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (6) In this age of ignorance and rank materialism, if someone has eve=\r\nn a \n\n&gt; &gt;faint idea that spiritual progress is important, is looking for go=\r\nd and is \n&gt; &gt;attracted to a specific advanced sadhana (e.g. Chandipath), th=\r\nat person \n&gt; &gt;obviously has some good karmas and good vasanas. That person =\r\nhas done that \n&gt; &gt;sadhana in the past. Previous life&#39;s sadhana itself is on=\r\ne&#39;s adhikara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (7) If you have a good understanding of what =\r\nis what, how things work, \n&gt;why \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;one should do something, how to do it=\r\n, what is more important and what is less \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;important, that is what ini=\r\ntiation is all about!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free J=\r\nyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It You=\r\nrself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www=\r\n.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://Saraswati=\r\nFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is my personal opinion that Strong and long standing =\r\nurge should be \n\n&gt; &gt;considered as Initiation at least in this age.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; I know a person who wanted to recite Chandi paatha regularly but was \n&gt;no=\r\nt \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;able to almost for a year.

There are bound to be various perspect=\r\nives and this may distract or confuse the initial practitioner. Moreover th=\r\ne tyranny of over-intellectualization has to be kept in mind. To any such r=\r\neader my advice is- please follow what you are doing currently. Things will=\r\n evolve and happen on their own accord. Whatever is suited to you will happ=\r\nen in the natural flow of Life. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In this post I will also touch upon=\r\n certain other topics raised in some related posts while primarily addressi=\r\nng Rajarshi ji&#39;s queries.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I had talked to a few people w=\r\nho adhere to different paramparas &gt;&gt;&gt;within the broader subset of =\r\nKalikula. They said that the &gt;&gt;&gt;initiation in Chandi sadhana in re=\r\nquired for not only the parayana &gt;&gt;&gt;but also (mostly?) because of\n=\r\n the main mantra. Normally we are &gt;&gt;&gt;accustomed with only the nava=\r\nrna mantra, but there are various &gt;&gt;&gt;other mantras of the differen=\r\nt aspects of the Universal Chandi, of &gt;&gt;&gt;which the navarna we know=\r\n of, is probably the mildest. To chant &gt;&gt;&gt;one of these mantras and=\r\n awaken the same needs initiation. This, &gt;&gt;&gt;they said, is a part o=\r\nf the &gt;&gt;&gt;entire Chandi sadhana. What is your &gt;&gt;opinion on th=\r\nis?&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Broadly speaking most of the above is true from the =\r\ntraditional *Sakta* perspective. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana as enjoined by Kali=\r\nkula emphasises MANTRA sadhana. Merely chanting the Devi Mahatmyam text is =\r\nnot the same as Sri Sri Chandi sadhana, as per this view. It has various ma=\r\nntric nuances and practices including other mantras and bijas and ways to m=\r\nake them work. I will expand on this at the end of this post after addressi=\r\nng your other points.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As a corollary to your\n above para=\r\ngraph, one can therefore read the &gt;&gt;&gt;text of the Chandi in a poura=\r\nnik approach, as a sacred myth? There &gt;&gt;&gt;are people, specially in =\r\nBengal, who do a Chandipath on their own &gt;&gt;&gt;without having undergo=\r\nne any formal initiation. How good or bad is &gt;&gt;&gt;this practise?&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;As always there will be varied beliefs and opinions ranging from the ve=\r\nry rigid traditional extreme to the very liberal and casual new-age extreme=\r\n based on one&#39;s personal affiliations, family and cultural influences. I wi=\r\nll speak for *myself*. I prefer the moderate view that is respectful to tra=\r\ndition but does not allow tradition to be one more fetter. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Quite of=\r\nten many of our beliefs are fear-based rather than knowledge-based. However=\r\n undigested, unassimilated and unharmonised information gathered from the i=\r\nnternet or even the print media is not knowledge. There is no need to be fe=\r\narful as long as one is not experimenting with\n mantramarga based on fragme=\r\nnted information gathered from books or worse still the internet. As long a=\r\ns one does the parayana along with other supportive practices such as kirta=\r\nn, swadhyaya, reflection and bhakti bhava, initiation need not be a binding=\r\n factor. However if one wishes to do Sri Sri Chandi sadhana in a full-fledg=\r\ned manner as per the traditional Sakta perspective, better be initiated. If=\r\n one strongly wills it (sankalpa) and is suited to it, the external guru an=\r\nd initiation will happen on their own accord. For the rest who are not pred=\r\nominantly suited to or inclined towards mantramarga, this discussion is not=\r\n relevant. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There &gt;&gt;&gt;are people, specially in B=\r\nengal, who do a Chandipath on &gt;&gt;&gt;their own &gt;&gt;&gt;without hav=\r\ning undergone any formal initiation. How &gt;&gt;&gt;good or bad is &gt;&gt=\r\n;&gt;this practise?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bengal is one of the areas of the subcontinent w=\r\nhere Kalikula flourished in a\n full-fledged manner at one time. So at the c=\r\nollective level Kalikula is deeply embedded in the collective unconscious a=\r\nnd thereby the tendency to do Chandipath irrespective of initiation. To und=\r\nertand this one needs to appreciate the dynamics between Kundalini and *KUL=\r\nA* KUNDALINII which are akin to the individual unconscious and collective u=\r\nnconscious. If a particular family/significant member of the family has pra=\r\ncticed the sadhana of a devata for sometime, the descendants automatically =\r\nhave its influence in their unconscious. That is why we are advised to wors=\r\nhip the kuladevata along with ishta devata though ishta devata remains a ma=\r\njor focus. The same applies to parayana too. Bengal was at one time a hotbe=\r\nd for the living and breathing tradition of Kalikula. Though we do not see =\r\nits flowering at the same level or in the same form today, at the unseen an=\r\nd unconscious collective level, the age-old Kalikula is very much alive and=\r\n breathing.\n &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spiritual life is all about Awareness and oversimplify=\r\ning it further, making the unconscious conscious is what Awareness is about=\r\n. In true Advaitic fashion the collective and individual consciousness are =\r\nnot separate. The advent of Sri Ramakrishna is a predictable culmination of=\r\n the flowering of Kalikula at a collective level. His advent marks a major =\r\nmilestone in not just Kalikula sadhana but Sakta sadhana itself. Irrespecti=\r\nve of the physical death of Sri Ramakrishna, his satsangha is possible for =\r\nall sincere seekers. Whilst swadhyaya of the Kathamrta is the easiest way t=\r\no revel in his Satsangha, it is possible to connect with him through a comb=\r\nination of trust (sraddha) and sense of belongingness too. If you consider =\r\nhim as your APTA, he automatically becomes your apta at a manasik level. Th=\r\nis sense of belongingness straightaway opens the doors of your heart and ma=\r\nkes his grace and protection possible. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In view of the above discuss=\r\ned\n factors, it might be okay to do Chandi parayana without initiation, in =\r\nour times. Initiation could happen in the long run if it is meant to be. Ho=\r\nwever traditionally speaking Sri Sri Chandipath without initiation is unima=\r\nginable as Sri Sri Chandi&#39;s integrated sadhana includes various other mantr=\r\nas and bijas that are generally not written in texts though some texts talk=\r\n about them without giving the complete details. Diksha includes all this a=\r\nnd much more. Here a word on `diksha&#39; itself is in order to clarify the dif=\r\nference between uninitiated Devi Mahatmya parayana and initiated Sri Sri Ch=\r\nandi sadhana. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Diksha differs in accordance with the sampradaya or t=\r\nhe lineage within Kalikula or Srikula. To understand `diksha&#39; itself, one n=\r\needs to examine certain differences (bhedas), of which the following are mo=\r\nst important:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1. Guru Parampara: This forms the core of Devi Upasana=\r\n and the other bhedas (differences) are in a way based on\n this.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2. =\r\nSampradaya: Guru of any authentic lineage should necessarily belong to one =\r\nof the recognized sampradayas. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3. Diksha: Depending on the disciple=\r\n&#39;s eligibility and the Guru&#39;s capability, the type of diksha too varies. &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;4. Yaga Bheda: There are four levels of Yajna or yaga - Antaryaga, Ba=\r\nhiryaga,Mahayaga and Rahoyaga. Guru initiates the disciple into one or more=\r\n of these paths depending on the adhikara (aptitudes, needs and capabilitie=\r\ns) of the sadhaka. Only antaryaga and bahiryaga are relevant to our discuss=\r\nion. I have already expanded on this in another post on Yajna. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;5. D=\r\nevata Bheda: Though the Devi is only One, depending on the samskara and vas=\r\nana of the initiate, he is initiated into the worship of Kali or Sri and th=\r\nus the paths of Kalikula and Srikula or Kalividya and Srividya. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;6. =\r\nAchara Bheda: Depending on the initiate&#39;s samskara and adhikara, broadly sp=\r\neaking there are seven acharas- Vedachara,\n Vaisnavachara, Saivachara, Daks=\r\nhinachara, Vamachara, Siddhantachara , and Kaulachara. Within the framework=\r\n of Sakta sadhana, there are only three acharas- Samaya, Dakshina and Kaula=\r\nchara. It is highly misleading to speak of the *superiority* of one achara =\r\nover the other. The path, the chosen form of the Mother (Kali or Sri), the =\r\nmeans of worship, are all differently devised to suit the varying temperame=\r\nnts of the practitioners. All forms of the Devi and all paths of sadhana ar=\r\ne equally respectable and ancient enough. The differences pertain more to t=\r\nhe practitioner and NOT TO THE DIVINITY. As such we are advised not to degr=\r\nade or criticize any path or deity. All upasanas lead to the Devi and all s=\r\nadhakas have the Devi within them. To talk lowly of any other sadhana marga=\r\n or rupa of the Devi amounts to insulting the Devi Herself. As Sri Bhaskara=\r\nraya observes with characteristic tolerance, &quot;all vidyas are not different,=\r\n a comparison of one to another (in\n the texts) is merely for the sake of p=\r\nraising and encouraging its performance&quot;. One could as well extend this tol=\r\nerance (if not acceptance) to all forms of God and all paths of attaining H=\r\ner/Him. In the ultimate reckoning, any division is relative as there is onl=\r\ny the ONE. Advaita is the true essence of Sakta sadhana. All paths are prac=\r\ntically along a *circular* continuum. An intellectual debate on the differe=\r\nnces between various paths is irrelevant to sadhana itself though it has re=\r\nlevance to academicians or to the respective world-view of the sadhaka. Ins=\r\ntead sadhakas should focus on the underlying unity of all paths and the ult=\r\nimate Oneness of all forms of the Divine. This is a major tenet of Sakta sa=\r\ndhana.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;7. Mantra Bheda =E2=80=93 Based on certain factors including =\r\nthe sadhaka&#39;s adhikara bheda, he is initiated into a different mantra. It i=\r\ns not uncommon that the same sadhaka is initiated into various forms of the=\r\n mantra progressively in a gradual\n manner if he persists with commitment. =\r\nFor instance in Sri Vidya upasana the mantra of Sri has five variant versio=\r\nns- Bala, Panchadashi, Shodashi, Para shodashi and Guhya shodashi. Bala man=\r\ntra is the entry level or preparatory level mantra for Sri Vidya. Likewise =\r\nthe navakshari or navarna mantra too has SEVEN VARIANT versions, of which t=\r\nhe Navarna mantra that most written texts include is the mildest and akin t=\r\no the entry level Bala mantra in Sri Vidya upasana. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The *details* o=\r\nf the seven variant versions of the navakshari or the twelve different ways=\r\n of doing Sri Sri Chandi path are really unnecessary to our current discuss=\r\nion. Instead in my next post I will write more on MANTRA and its central im=\r\nportance in sadhana as per the Sakta world-view. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Finally a word on =\r\n`Vak and `artha&#39; too is in order here. It is true that one derives great be=\r\nnefit by chanting a mantra in its original form. No doubt translation of a =\r\nmantra is NOT the same as\n the mantra in its original form as `vak&#39;. Undoub=\r\ntedly `Sabda&#39; comes first and then only the `artha&#39; follows (&quot;Artha Srishta=\r\neh Purvam Sabda srushtih&quot;). However one has to bear in mind that `Vak&#39; and =\r\n`Artha&#39; are interdependent and inseparable. I will elaborate on Sabda/Vak/A=\r\nrtha in my next post along with Sri Bhaskararaya makhin&#39;s commentary and th=\r\ne importance accorded to the fifteen levels of meaning (artha) of a mantra,=\r\n so much so that he even affirms that, &quot;the mere utterance of sabda without=\r\n a knowledge of the true import bears no fruit, even as the offering thrown=\r\n over ashes in the absence of fire does not burst into flame&quot;. I will exami=\r\nne both sides of `sabda&#39; and `artha&#39; in my next post as and when I can. All=\r\n Indian traditions that explore `Vak&#39; or `Sabda&#39; agree that both are insepa=\r\nrable. The very mention of the words `sabda&#39; and `artha&#39; brings to my mind =\r\nthe most beautiful mangala sloka from Kalidasa&#39;s `Raghuvamsa&#39; wherein he co=\r\nmpares the\n inseparable and interdependent nature of `Vak&#39; and `Artha&#39; to `=\r\nSiva&#39; and `Sakti&#39; the parents of the entire universe =E2=80=A6.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;vaga=\r\nrthaviva samprkthau vagarthaaprathipaththaye / &lt;BR&gt;jagathaha pitharau vandh=\r\ne parvathiparameshvarau // &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Regards,&lt;BR&gt;Satya Prakash&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In =\r\n&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnof=\r\nollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Dear Satya Prakash ji,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thank you for your beautiful=C3=82=\r\n&nbsp;analysis of Sri Sri Chandi. I read it and reflected &lt;BR&gt;&gt; on it, a=\r\nnd in my limited understand I agree to most of what you have said. &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Specially your explanation pertaining to=C3=82&nbsp;Chand-munda and=C3=82&=\r\nnbsp;Sumbha-Nishumbh were &lt;BR&gt;&gt; awesome!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I have a quest=\r\nion about your following paragraph:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;there are thos=\r\ne who adhere to the Tantric\n approach and do the sadhana as per &lt;BR&gt;&gt; th=\r\ne mantra marga. It is this particular approach that needs initiation as per=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; its own principles. Initiation is not mandatory if one adopts the=\r\n Vedantic path &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of Viveka and Vichara, or the Yogic path of Abhyasa=\r\n and Vairagya, or even the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Pauranic approach of reading the text d=\r\nevoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise Homam &lt;BR&gt;&gt; too is not required if one =\r\nis not inclined to the predominantly Vaidik practice &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of Ritual/Yag=\r\nnya. One may benefit from any or all of these approaches to Sri Sri &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; Chandi. However one has to bear in mind that the living and breathing tra=\r\nditions &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of both Kalikula as well as Srikula as practiced originall=\r\ny in various parts of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the subcontinent originally trace themselves=\r\n to Tantra marga and hence the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; importance of initiation for those =\r\npaths, be it Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n 1) I had talked to a\n few people who adhere to different paramparas within=\r\n the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; broader subset of Kalikula. They said that the initiation in =\r\nChandi sadhana in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; required for not only the parayana but also (mos=\r\ntly?) because of the main &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mantra. Normally we are accustomed with =\r\nonly the navarna mantra, but there are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; various other mantras of th=\r\ne different aspects of the Universal Chandi, of which &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the navarna =\r\nwe know of, is probably the mildest. To chant one of these mantras &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n and awaken the same needs initiation. This, they said, is a part of the en=\r\ntire &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Chandi sadhana.=C3=82&nbsp;What=C3=82&nbsp;is your opinion on=\r\n this?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2) As a corollary to your above paragraph, one can =\r\ntherefore read the text of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the Chandi in a pouranik approach, as a=\r\n sacred myth? There are people, specially &lt;BR&gt;&gt; in Bengal, who do a Chan=\r\ndipath on their own without having undergone any formal &lt;BR&gt;&gt; initiation=\r\n.
