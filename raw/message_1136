Unfortunately, =\r\nI was not able to make use of your video. \nI will study and try to learn fr=\r\nom my mistakes and your video. I \nwould like to understand the reasoning be=\r\nhind mudras you&#39;ve \nperformed. Is it possible for you to provide video of m=\r\nudras \n(closeup, side and front angle)? Also I noticed, you have placed the=\r\n \npurnahuti to your brahm-randrha before sacrificing it in fire. What \nis t=\r\nhe reasoning behind it? is it like requesting karmas to permeate \ninto the =\r\ncoconut to be burned? \nAgain thanks very much for your service to the commu=\r\nnity!!!\n\nRegards\n\n\n"}}
