Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@=\r\n...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Not all &quot;clean places&quot; are equal. Vibrations=\r\n do vary from place to \nplace. \n&gt; The vibrations of the place do not matter=\r\n to some, but do matter to \nmany.\n&gt; \n&gt; Places with taamasic vibrations are =\r\nnot necessarily bad for sadhana \nfor \n&gt; everyone. When one is pure and succ=\r\needs in sadhana at such places, \none can \n&gt; make faster progress.\n&gt; \n&gt; A sm=\r\nashaana (cemetary) has decidedly stronger tamasik vibrations \nthan \n&gt; basem=\r\nents completely under ground. But several great yogis in some \n&gt; traditions=\r\n did sadhana in smashana and realized self. Nevertheless \nit is not \n&gt; cond=\r\nucive to fruitful sadhana by most people.\n&gt; \n&gt; An average person is better =\r\noff doing sadhana in places without \nsuch \n&gt; vibrations, atleast initially.=\r\n So I do not recommend doing \nspiritual sadhana \n&gt; in underground basements=\r\n.
