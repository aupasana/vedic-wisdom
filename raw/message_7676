It does not specifically describe t=\r\nhe form of &quot;Chandi&quot;.&gt; &gt;\n(2) The real form of deities is energy, that can ma=\r\nnifest within one&#39;s &gt;\nown consciousness.&gt; &gt; (3) Lalita is a gentle form as =\r\nthe name implies.\nHowever, some of her &gt; names describe a fierce form. Simi=\r\nlarly, some of\nthe names of a fierce &gt; deity may describe a gentle form. Bo=\r\nttomline is\nthat different deities &gt; describe different energy forms and se=\r\nveral\nother enegy forms can be &gt; *derived* from that energy. Energy is\nconv=\r\nertible.&gt; &gt; For example, you can generate electric energy or\nmagnetic energ=\r\ny or &gt; mechanical kinetic energy from nuclear energy from\na big nuclear fus=\r\nion. &gt; If 1000 names of the nuclear fusion describe it\nin one name as energ=\r\ny &gt; that lights up a house or a town, don&#39;t think it\nis a gentle form. It &gt;=\r\n can support that gentle aspect too, but it is a\nvery fierce form. If you &gt;=\r\n really see that energy in its raw form, you\nwill see that nuclear fusion &gt;=\r\n is certainly not gentle.&gt; &gt; One who\nexperienced the energy of a supposed f=\r\nierce deity as being &gt; gentle or\nvice versa hasn&#39;t experienced that deity i=\r\nn the complete form &gt; and\nexperienced only a small derived aspect of that d=\r\neity.&gt; &gt; (4) Though I\nsay that the real form of deities is energy, the &gt; ic=\r\nonography IS very\nimportant and holds keys. However, some keys of some &gt; pa=\r\nrticularly\npowerful siddha mantras are intentionally misplaced by &gt; rishis.=\r\n&gt; &gt; For\nexample, I know someone who was doing sadhana of a higher deity. He=\r\n &gt;\nwas imagining her in a form using a popular dhyana shloka. This popular\n=\r\n&gt; dhyana shloka for that mantra - which is known to be a siddha mantra -\n&gt; =\r\nmatches the imagery created by some key words in the mantra. He was &gt;\ndoing=\r\n the sadhana sincerely, but never formed a connection to the mantra\n&gt; or ex=\r\nperienced anything. After a few weeks, his guru/mentor gave him a\n&gt; differe=\r\nnt dhyana shloka of the same deity composed by a great yogi of\n&gt; past, whic=\r\nh is not typically used with that particular mantra, because\n&gt; some words i=\r\nn the mantra suggest a different imagery. This sadhaka &gt;\nswitched to it. He=\r\n started visualizing the deity differently. Though &gt;\nthis visualization was=\r\n contrary to the words in the mantra, this &gt;\nactually worked. It made a big=\r\n difference. The person started to &gt;\nexperience some things internally and =\r\nunderstood the essence of the &gt;\nmantra in a flash. Now, the true meaning of=\r\n the mantra became crystal &gt;\nclear through an internal experience.&gt; &gt; The f=\r\ninal understanding was\ninternal, philosophical and based on subtle &gt; play o=\r\nf different cosmic\nenergies. But, that beautiful understanding was &gt; trigge=\r\nred ONLY AFTER a\nspecific physical form was imagined by the mind.&gt; &gt; Some p=\r\nowerful\nmantras do have a specific physical form associated with &gt; them and=\r\n you\nwill be kind of lost without knowing that form or &gt; corresponding\ndhya=\r\nna.&gt; &gt; (5) BTW, having said the above, I need to make one important\npoint.&gt;=\r\n &gt; It is foolish to go around asking people and gurus to give you\nthe right=\r\n &gt; mantra or dhyana of this or that mantra.

It does not specifically describe the form of &quot;Cha=\r\nndi&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; (2) The real form of deities is energy, that can man=\r\nifest within one&#39;s &lt;br&gt;&gt; own consciousness.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; (3) Lalita =\r\nis a gentle form as the name implies. However, some of her &lt;br&gt;&gt; names d=\r\nescribe a fierce form. Similarly, some of the names of a fierce &lt;br&gt;&gt; de=\r\nity may describe a gentle form. Bottomline is that different deities &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; describe different energy forms and several other enegy forms can be &lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; *derived* from that energy. Energy is convertible.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; F=\r\nor example, you can generate electric energy or magnetic energy or &lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n mechanical kinetic energy from nuclear energy from a big nuclear fusion. &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; If 1000 names of the nuclear fusion describe it in one name as ener=\r\ngy &lt;br&gt;&gt; that lights up a house or a town, don&#39;t think it is a gentle fo=\r\nrm. It &lt;br&gt;&gt; can support that gentle aspect too, but it is a very fierce=\r\n form. If you &lt;br&gt;&gt; really see that energy in its raw form, you will see=\r\n that nuclear fusion &lt;br&gt;&gt; is certainly not gentle.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; One=\r\n who experienced the energy of a supposed fierce deity as being &lt;br&gt;&gt; ge=\r\nntle or vice versa hasn&#39;t experienced that deity in the complete form &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; and experienced only a small derived aspect of that deity.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; (4) Though I say that the real form of deities is energy, the &lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n iconography IS very important and holds keys. However, some keys of some &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; particularly powerful siddha mantras are intentionally misplaced by=\r\n &lt;br&gt;&gt; rishis.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; For example, I know someone who was doin=\r\ng sadhana of a higher deity. He &lt;br&gt;&gt; was imagining her in a form using =\r\na popular dhyana shloka. This popular &lt;br&gt;&gt; dhyana shloka for that mantr=\r\na - which is known to be a siddha mantra - &lt;br&gt;&gt; matches the imagery cre=\r\nated by some key words in the mantra. He was &lt;br&gt;&gt; doing the sadhana sin=\r\ncerely, but never formed a connection to the mantra &lt;br&gt;&gt; or experienced=\r\n anything. After a few weeks, his guru/mentor gave him a &lt;br&gt;&gt; different=\r\n dhyana shloka of the same deity composed by a great yogi of &lt;br&gt;&gt; past,=\r\n which is not typically used with that particular mantra, because &lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nsome words in the mantra suggest a different imagery. This sadhaka &lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n switched to it. He started visualizing the deity differently. Though &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; this visualization was contrary to the words in the mantra, this &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; actually worked. It made a big difference. The person started to &lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; experience some things internally and understood the essence of the &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; mantra in a flash. Now, the true meaning of the mantra became crystal &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; clear through an internal experience.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; The final un=\r\nderstanding was internal, philosophical and based on subtle &lt;br&gt;&gt; play o=\r\nf different cosmic energies. But, that beautiful understanding was &lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n triggered ONLY AFTER a specific physical form was imagined by the mind.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Some powerful mantras do have a specific physical form assoc=\r\niated with &lt;br&gt;&gt; them and you will be kind of lost without knowing that =\r\nform or &lt;br&gt;&gt; corresponding dhyana.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; (5) BTW, having sai=\r\nd the above, I need to make one important point.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; It is foo=\r\nlish to go around asking people and gurus to give you the right &lt;br&gt;&gt; ma=\r\nntra or dhyana of this or that mantra. Until you are pure enough and &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; prepared, no real yogi will ever give you the keys to anything really &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; siddha, i.e. powerful and potent enough to work quickly. Instead tak=\r\ne &lt;br&gt;&gt; something standard like Chandipath or Vishnu sahasranama stotram=\r\n and &lt;br&gt;&gt; keep chanting it or doing homam with it. First prepare yourse=\r\nlf. When &lt;br&gt;&gt; you are prepared, Nature will make arrangements for whate=\r\nver is required &lt;br&gt;&gt; for your dharma.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;&gt; ---------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------&lt;br&gt;&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jy=\r\notish Writings,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and=\r\n Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;&gt;                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt;       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;br&gt;&gt;   =\r\n Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;br&gt;&gt;   =\r\n                    Twitter ID: @homam108&lt;br&gt;&gt; -------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--6-5207268819-3767598620=:0--\r\n\n"}}
