According to Radhe Shyam Vishwakarma (57),=\r\n a local and a\nregular visitor to the temple, women are generally the wives=\r\n of the male priests\nand are equally aware of the rituals and tradition of =\r\nleading the puja ceremony\nin a Hindu temple.\n\nIt is worth mentioning here t=\r\nhat the temple, which already brakes the fanatic\nideology that only Brahmin=\r\ns can have access to the temple and lead the prayers,\nis actually looked af=\r\nter and managed by members from boatmen community. &quot;There\nis no methodologi=\r\ncal training that we are provided with which is given at\nuniversities and g=\r\nurukuls. However, the tradition is on since generations and we\nfollow what =\r\nour elders tell us to do. But, we only know the tradition of\nperforming rit=\r\nuals at this temple of Goddess Durga and do not go out to perform\nsimilar r=\r\nituals for the common man,&quot; informed Poonam (31), a priests and member\nof b=\r\noatment community.\n\nAs many as seven women priests from the same group of b=\r\noatmen are there in the\ntemple and take their duty according to a given sch=\r\nedule. &quot;We do not mind giving\nthe prasad and flowers to women inside the te=\r\nmple. They offer it to the deity\nand bless us. Moreover, they are more conc=\r\nerned and systematic as compared to\nthe male priests,&quot; says Jyoti Soni, a d=\r\nevotee.\n\nKusum Devi, a 64-year-old woman, has been sitting at Kal Bhairo te=\r\nmple for the\npast 30 years and has been guiding devotees and helping them w=\r\nith rituals to\nescape various diseases, problems and adversities. &quot;There ar=\r\ne many male priests\ntoo but people trust Kusum Devi more for her effective =\r\nhealing prayers,&quot; says\nManoj, a flower vendor outside the temple. According=\r\n to Kusum, the healing\nprayers are easy to learn but need proper practice a=\r\nnd concentration. However,\nshe accepts that they are not very well stocked =\r\nwith mythological wisdom.\n\nApart from less methodological path of attaining=\r\n priesthood by women, a gurukul\nPanini Kanya Mahavidyalaya in the Mehmoorga=\r\nnj is breaking the 5,000-year-old law\nof Manusmriti that women cannot perfo=\r\nrm religious rites, enchant hymes or read\nVedas.\n\nAccording to Acharya Prit=\r\ni Vimarshini of the gurukul, the 40-year-old\ninstitution exclusively for gi=\r\nrls has been imparting Vedic knowledge to as many\nas 60 girls every year. &quot;=\r\nThe girls are being trained in performing Karma Kands,\nSanskars and are tau=\r\nght Sanskrit, Vedas, Ashtadhyayi and Indian philosophy,&quot;\nsays Priti. Moreov=\r\ner, the gurukul follows Vedic system rather than caste system\nand girls fro=\r\nm different castes, including dalit, attain priesthood here after\nfollowing=\r\n rigorous hard work and studies.\n\n&quot;We invite girls from Panini Kanya Mahavi=\r\ndyalaya for every ritual at our home.\nThey follow a systematic method and a=\r\nll the hymns and rites they perform are\nvery peaceful and serene,&quot; says Rah=\r\nul Srivastava, a resident of Pandeypur.\n&quot;These young girls perform much eff=\r\nective rites than any male Brahmin or\npriest,&quot; says Dinesh Barnwal, a resid=\r\nent of Chowk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
