Much appreciat=\r\ned! I&#39;m certain the priest was facing East, however, I&#39;m less certain of th=\r\ne direction in which he threw the darbha (which very well may have been Sou=\r\ntheast as indicated by you). \n&gt; \n&gt; I humbly submit that Nirritti&#39;s position=\r\n is Southwest. This is how I understand the 8 Dikpala&#39;s directional positio=\r\nns (again my knowledge is limited and clarifications from people like you w=\r\nho have traversed the path much longer than I are always welcome!):\n&gt; \n&gt; In=\r\ndra - East\n&gt; Agni - Southeast\n&gt; Yama - South\n&gt; Nirritti - Southwest\n&gt; Varun=\r\na - West\n&gt; Vayu - Northwest\n&gt; Soma - North\n&gt; Ishan - Northeast\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards=\r\n (and thanks again),\n&gt; Alok.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;=\r\nnaaraayana_iyer&quot; &lt;narayan.iyer@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Alok,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You =\r\ncan use a small piece of dharbha for doing so and put it in the reject bowl=\r\n which is usually kept in the south east direction. Can you confirm if that=\r\n priest wasn&#39;t facing North, in which case the left shoulder would be South=\r\neast or Nirritti direction.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt; Narayan\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- I=\r\nn vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;alokbhat&quot; &lt;alokbhat@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; W=\r\nhen you draw the six lines with a darbha on the base of the havan kund befo=\r\nre placing a camphor in the center and lighting it, what do yo do with the =\r\ndarbha? I&#39;ve sometimes used it in the homa and other times thrown it away. =\r\nI ask because I noticed a priest in our local tempple throw it over his lef=\r\nt shoulder (southwest direction) when facing east.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Alok.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
