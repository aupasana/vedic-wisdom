He is not a *vyakti* or\nperson but *shakti* or energy. Krishna was *=\r\npoornakalaavataran, *a complete\nincarnation. The purpose of celebration is =\r\nto realise that Krishna is in\nme. In the *Bhagwad Gita*, Krishna says, =E2=\r\n=80=9COne who sees everyone in Me and\nsees Me in everyone, for such a perso=\r\nn, I shall never remain hidden and he\nshall never be far from me.=E2=80=9D\n=\r\n\nKrishna=E2=80=99s life has all the nine *rasas* or flavours. For instance,=\r\n he was\nnaughty like a child, a warrior, joy personified and a source of\nkn=\r\nowledge. He was a perfect friend and guru. His birth on ashtami signifies\nh=\r\nis mastery of both spiritual and material worlds. He is a great teacher\nand=\r\n spiritual inspiration as well as the consummate politician. On the one\nhan=\r\nd, he is Yogeshwara, the Lord of Yogas while on the other, he is a\nmischiev=\r\nous thief. His behaviour is a perfect balance of extremes =E2=80=94 perhaps=\r\n\nthis is why his personality is so difficult to fathom. The avdhoot is\nobli=\r\nvious to the world outside and a materialistic person, a politician or\na ki=\r\nng is oblivious to the spiritual world. But Krishna is both\nDwarkadheesh an=\r\nd Yogeshwar.\n\n To understand Krishna, simply become Radha, Arjuna or Uddhav=\r\na. Three kinds\nof people seek refuge in God -- the lover, the miserable and=\r\n the wise.\nUddhava was wise, Arjuna was miserable and Radha was love person=\r\nified.\nKrishna=E2=80=99s teachings are most relevant to our times as they n=\r\neither let you\nget lost in material pursuits nor make you completely withdr=\r\nawn. They\nrekindle your life, from being a burnt-out and stressed personali=\r\nty to a\nmore centred and dynamic one. Krishna teaches us devotion with skil=\r\nl. To\ncelebrate Gokulashtami is to imbibe extremely opposite yet compatible=\r\n\nqualities and manifest them in your own life.\n\n Krishna tells Arjuna, &quot;You=\r\n are very dear to me&quot; and says he must\nsurrender. Surrender begins with an =\r\nassumption. You assume you are the most\nbeloved of the Divine, and then sur=\r\nrender happens. Surrender is not an\naction; it is an assumption. Non-surren=\r\nder is ignorance, an illusion.\nSurrender has to begin as an assumption and =\r\nthen it reveals itself as a\nreality. Finally, it reveals itself as an illus=\r\nion. An illusion, because\nthere are no two aspects, no duality. There is no=\r\n independent existence of\nanyone. An individual has no independent existenc=\r\ne.\n\n So, in the Gita, Krishna says, &quot;He is dear to Me who neither goes on\nt=\r\nhanking people nor hates anyone.=E2=80=9D Thanking and feeling obliged indi=\r\ncates\nthat you believe in someone else&#39;s existence rather than in the Divin=\r\ne who\nis ruling everything. When you feel obliged, then you are not honouri=\r\nng the\nprinciples of karma or the divine plan. Appreciate people for what t=\r\nhey\nare; do not thank them for what they do. Otherwise your thankfulness is=\r\n\ncentered around the ego. You are grateful, but not for an act. You are\ngra=\r\nteful for what is.\n\nHence the most authentic way of celebrating Janamashtam=\r\ni is to know that\nyou have to play a dual role =E2=80=94 of being a respons=\r\nible human being and at\nthe same time to realise that you are above all eve=\r\nnts, the untouched\nBrahmn. Imbibing a bit of avadhoot and a bit of activism=\r\n in your life is\nthe real significance of celebrating Janmashtami. Awaken t=\r\nhe Krishna in\nyour consciousness =E2=80=93 =E2=80=9CKrishna is not far from=\r\n me, not separate from me, he\nis within me=E2=80=99-- this feeling will fil=\r\nl your life with Krishna.\n\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n\r\n--f46d043c7e920d073504c6da524a\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://timesofindia.speakingtree.in/spiritual-articles/faith-and=\r\n-rituals/awaken-krishna-in-your-consciousness&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://tim=\r\nesofindia.speakingtree.in/spiritual-articles/faith-and-rituals/awaken-krish=\r\nna-in-your-consciousness&lt;/a&gt;=C2=A0&lt;div&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p style=3D&quot;color:r=\r\ngb(51,51,51);font-size:14px;font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;margin:0=\r\npx;padding:0px&quot;&gt;Janmashtami celebrates the birth of Krishna.
