This was also happened at Okha Port soon after my first mira=\r\nculous experience. The first was on 5th April 74 whereas this was in the mi=\r\nd of May 1974, the date I do not remember.\nAs I have written in my previous=\r\n mail my duty was as a Telegraphist at Okha Post Office and my duty hours w=\r\nere from 7 am to 12 pm and from 4 pm to 7 pm. I was coming to my home at 12=\r\n pm and cooking my food daily as my wife was at her parent&#39;s home at Ahmeda=\r\nbad then. I was alone there. I was eating my food at 1 pm around and taking=\r\n rest for 2 hours. I was awaking between 3 to 3.30 pm and preparing my tea =\r\nbefore going to office. This was a daily routine. \nI was receiving 30 to 40=\r\n telegrams daily before 12 pm and was giving them to Mr. Babaubhai Pandya, =\r\na delivery postman of 50 years age to deliver these telegrams to Banks, Nav=\r\ny, Fisheries and Shipping agents, as Okha is a big port. Babubhai was deliv=\r\nering telegrams and coming back to Post office at 4 pm daily.\nI was then re=\r\nciting Shri Ramkrishnadev Mantra given by Mr. Patel to me whole day and rea=\r\nding Shri Ramkrishna Kathamritam daily after taking my food at noon before =\r\nrest. One day I was reading Kathamritam after my food, I slept while readin=\r\ng the book. It was a long sleep but I heard=C2=A0 somebody is knocking my d=\r\noor and I was awake. I opened the door and he was Babubhai, my deliveryman.=\r\n \n&quot;Are you still sleeping Rawalbhai? See your watch, it is already 3.45&quot;\n&quot;O=\r\nh, thanks Babubhai, today I am really late. Let us drink tea together today=\r\n as you are never coming to my home&quot;\nAnd I immediately prepared the tea. We=\r\n both took the tea and talked some general talk then. \n&quot; Ok, now I am going=\r\n to deliver these 2 telegrams to Banks and coming to office within 10 to 15=\r\n minutes.&quot; \n&quot; Ok,&quot; I said and Babubhai went to office. \nAfter 5 minutes tim=\r\ne I also went to office and reached my office at 4.10 hours. I saw Babubhai=\r\n there, waiting for me. \n&quot;Why late Rawalbhai?&quot; he said.\n&quot; You know Babubhai=\r\n, you have awakened me today otherwise I might be still sleeping. Today how=\r\n you came to my house?=C2=A0 You are never coming to that area generally.&quot;\n=\r\n&quot;But I have not come to your house Rawalbhai, why should I come at this tim=\r\ne? My route is different, as you know. I have just come from market. I don&#39;=\r\nt understand what you are telling.&quot; He exclaimed.\nI was thrilled again with=\r\n excitement. Who was He who came to my house? It was not a dream. We had ta=\r\nken tea together and 2 cups of tea I had washed.\nI did not reply to Babubha=\r\ni but I still search the Answer as to Who was He to my home on that day?
