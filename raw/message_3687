Rao&quot; &lt;pvr108@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; A few quick points:\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) There is no absolute right and=\r\n wrong. Dharma often requires judging and balancing different criteria and =\r\nthe judgment may vary from place to place, time to time and person to perso=\r\nn.\n&gt; \n&gt; Uncooked (raw) rice grains last a long time without getting spoiled=\r\n, but cooked rice grains get spoiled fast. Unfortunately, people cannot eat=\r\n raw grains. So someone cooks for them. Do not expect cooked grains to last=\r\n a long time, even if a great cook cooked them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, generic and=\r\n raw spiritual teachings given in scriptures and taught by great yogis (e.g=\r\n. Brahman alone is real. World is maayaa. Do good to others. Sacrifice your=\r\n happiness for others) are relevant always, while very specific guidelines =\r\ngiven by great yogis in specific circumstances (e.g. It is ok to eat fish, =\r\nbut focus mind on god. It is ok to do homam with mustard oil instead of ghe=\r\ne. If someone comes to you and asks for money, give whatever you have) may =\r\nhave been given keeping the circumstances in mind and may be irrelevant in =\r\nother circumstances.\n&gt; \n&gt; If I reject spoiled food cooked by my wife who is=\r\n out of town and instead eat food made by my sister-in-law, it is not disre=\r\nspectful to my wife. She would not have expected me to hang on to her food =\r\nand eat it even after it expires.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately, many great yogis give=\r\n specific guidelines to people based on the circumstances (desa-kaala-paatr=\r\na), as people are not smart enough to know the right thing if given only ge=\r\nneric guidelines and want specific guidance. So they run the risk of someon=\r\ne using the guideline meant for a specific circumstance in other inapplicab=\r\nle circumstances while attributing it to them.\n&gt; \n&gt; (2) Eating the meat of =\r\nan animal that self-identifies with the body parts strongly is always a muc=\r\nh stronger karma than eating the stuff from plants that have much subtler s=\r\nelf-identification with the leaves and vegetables they grow. Irrespective o=\r\nf which spiritual giants ate fish in the past, it is bad karma.\n&gt; \n&gt; All of=\r\n us do many bad karmas and many good karmas and hope for them balance out. =\r\nVivekananda and Ramakrishna did so many good karmas, so many austerities an=\r\nd such intense spiritual sadhana. It may have offset any bad karma accumula=\r\nted by eating fish during the time they were not yet fully realized (after =\r\nfull realization, there are no karmas).\n&gt; \n&gt; (3) In the old days - even a c=\r\nentury back - people did much more sadhana than now and lived simpler and p=\r\nurer lifestyles. Now-a-days, we live in the middle of deep pollution - phys=\r\nical as well as spiritual - and our minds are bombarded with so much corrup=\r\nting influence. One may do a homam in the evening, go and turn on the TV an=\r\nd the sitcom coming on TV during prime time may have sexual innuendo. One m=\r\nay check email and get a spam mail about sexuality. There are images of hal=\r\nf-naked people and struggle for money everywhere. There are too many tempta=\r\ntions for the mind and too many opportunities to fall and commit bad karmas=\r\n (physically or mentally). The world of today is more challenging for a sad=\r\nhaka than at the time of Vivekananda.\n&gt; \n&gt; How good shoes one wears may not=\r\n matter if one is walking on a normal road in summer. One should better wea=\r\nr good shoes if one is walking on an icy pavement during winter, lest one s=\r\nhould fall!\n&gt; \n&gt; When there is so much corrupting influence around us that =\r\nwe cannot control and that is challenging us, we can atleast control our ow=\r\nn actions and habits and minimize the bad karmas we regularly commit and th=\r\ne chance of a fall.\n&gt; \n&gt; (4) When Lord Vishnu came to earth as Lord Rama, h=\r\ne taught the importance of Eka Patni Vrata (having only one wife). When he =\r\ncame back as Lord Krishna, he did not emphasize that anymore and had many w=\r\nives. When he came as Lord Narasimha or Lord Rama, he killed demons. When h=\r\ne came as Lord Buddha, he taught non-violence.\n&gt; \n&gt; When yogis like Ramakri=\r\nshna, Vivekananda, Ramana Maharshi, Sai Baba etc come also, their message i=\r\ns tuned for their desa-kaala-paatra. Different times require different leel=\r\nas, different missions, different messages and different styles.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfor=\r\ntunately, Jaambavanta did not recognize when Lord Rama came back as Lord Kr=\r\nishna and even fought with him!\n&gt; \n&gt; (5) While it is illogical to hold Thak=\r\nur, Mother and Swamiji accountable for the beliefs of these people, I admir=\r\ne their blind faith. If it is opportunism, i.e. they just want to eat fish =\r\nand use the icons of their organization as an excuse, that is bad. But, if =\r\nit is genuine blind faith that these icons were perfected beings and their =\r\nwords are never wrong, they will eventually make it. Opportunistic and egoi=\r\nstic faith is useless, but blind and complete faith accompanied by complete=\r\n surrender is very powerful. People with such faith WILL find their way.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; (6) The nearest path from Ujjain to Kashi does not go through Calcutta. =\r\nBut, if someone insists on going through Calcutta, what can you do? Everyon=\r\ne takes a spiritual path based on one&#39;s conditioning. If we see a short pat=\r\nh, we can only suggest it to others but nor force them to take it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bes=\r\nt regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------\n&gt; =C2=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyo=\r\ntish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri =\r\nTarpana:\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilm=\r\ns.org\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; =C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyo=\r\ntishWritings\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Fri, 2/5/10, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; F=\r\nrom: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Grea=\r\nt Vimalananda&#39;s opinion on &#39;Meat-eaters&#39;(Aghor -at the left hand of God)\n&gt; =\r\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Friday, February 5, 2010, 9:38 AM\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;       \n&gt;       \n=\r\n&gt;       Dear KK,\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Nice question. I was also thinking that.\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; Few days back when I went to Calcutta, (where fish is the staple diet=\r\n), one person told me confidently that there is no harm in eating fish or m=\r\neat because Swamiji used to do so, and in a Bengali book on the=C2=A0life o=\r\nf Sri Ramakrishna there is one example mentioned where a man came to ask hi=\r\nm if should quite non veg food, and supposedly Ramakrishna said first leave=\r\n &quot;Kamini&quot; and &quot;Kanchana&quot;, then think of food. =C2=A0Also a similar examples=\r\n was quoted to me from=C2=A0the life of Ma Sarada where - a certain book sa=\r\nys - she advised an ordinary devotee against leaving fish eating and rather=\r\n just focus mind on God.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; When I tried to reason with them that i=\r\nf these people were to come back again on planet earth they may not recomme=\r\nnd non veg eating - considering the state of the world today - I=C2=A0 was =\r\ncatergorically told they are all Trikalagyas, so if there is something wron=\r\ng in eating fish they would have told right then.=C2=A0 \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Then I =\r\ntried to say that the examples maybe specific individual cases, to which I =\r\nwas told, &quot;no&quot;, because based on a whole plethora of such examples even tod=\r\nay the monks of the Ramakrishna Order in West Bengal eat and serve fish. Th=\r\nis statement is a fact. I=C2=A0have had fish meals as prasad in many Ramakr=\r\nishna Missions across=C2=A0West Bengal.=C2=A0So, I was told, the monks of t=\r\nhe Ramakrishna Oder know about teachings of Ramakrishna and Ma Sarada bette=\r\nr than us ordrinary people. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I could make no further arguments a=\r\nnd of course had a harrowing time at home trying to convince my parents tha=\r\nt I have quit non veg food. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; A lot of Bengalis may not have been=\r\n able to implement the basic teachings of Ramakrishna in their lives, howev=\r\ner they faithfully follow fish eating as a sanction given by &quot;Thakur&quot; and &quot;=\r\nSri Sri Ma&quot; and &quot;Swamiji&quot;.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\nPS: No disrespect to anyone.

However, you are free to addres=\r\ns me as you feel like and I&#39;ll happily accept it hence forth.\n&gt; \n&gt; I just c=\r\name across Vimalananda&#39; s thought on Karma. He says (and Narasimha has many=\r\n a times repeated) that Karma is only generated (Binding to one) when one s=\r\nelf-identifies with it.\n&gt; Although, it may seem easy to understand intellec=\r\ntually, the state is multiple times difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, it&#39;=\r\ns an extremely important statement to answer our queries.\n&gt; \n&gt; Important in=\r\nformation about Vimalananda which I came to know only yesterday is that he =\r\nwas a big time smoker and there was not a single day passed in his life whe=\r\nn he didn&#39;t do smoking except on the final day of his departure from physic=\r\nal body. He used to as well `chew Tobacco&#39; frequently and occasionally\n&gt;  a=\r\nte meat. I gave this information, because as you pointed out (and I also ag=\r\nree) that it is an interesting coincidence of exact thoughts crossing our m=\r\ninds. Further, please also note an important thing. The Aghori used to say =\r\nvery frequently to all his audience to do what he says and not try to do wh=\r\nat he does.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now whatever I wrote above seems sufficient to answer the =\r\nquestions you asked. Let me put in my thoughts further (Mind you, these are=\r\n thoughts of an unrealized person and the worth can be next to nothing). Wh=\r\nen we take example cases of Swami Vivekananda or Vimalananda or Sainbaba or=\r\n any other such acknowledged spiritual giants, we tend to forget that they =\r\nare all realized souls who achieved very high level of spiritual realizatio=\r\nn. They are knower of everything or many things in the universe. Their indi=\r\nvidual ego is perfectly and completely tuned to universal ego. In short the=\r\ny *know* what they are doing. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis&#39;.\n&gt;  Relevant to o=\r\nur topic of discussion, I would say that if they ate meat or smoke cigar or=\r\n chew tobacco or killed animals, they actually knew what they are doing. Th=\r\nere would be surely a specific purpose behind each and every action of thei=\r\nrs because as I said, they know complete background behind their each actio=\r\nn and moreover their self identification is missing from the action and hen=\r\nce it is like Nature operates through them to accomplish a special purpose =\r\nwithout binding them in any cause-effect chain.\n&gt; Ramakrishna used to frequ=\r\nently say to all his disciples that Naren is very different from others. He=\r\n has a blazing spiritual fire burning within him which can consume anything=\r\n and everything. A food restriction does not bind him. He can eat anything =\r\nwithout getting spiritually troubled but for others, a kind of food intake =\r\nis extremely important.\n&gt; If Vivekananda ate meat during his stay in west, =\r\nit&#39;ll surely have some subtle purpose which is not\n&gt;  possible for majority=\r\n of us to comprehend unless explained by a person of that level. He might b=\r\ne removing `guilt&#39; from the sincere seekers amongst westerners so that he c=\r\nan be accepted by them as one of them and then slowly try to eradicate thei=\r\nr habits of meat eating and such other undesirable habits. It is also possi=\r\nble at the same time that he is nullifying some balanced Rinanubandha with =\r\nthe `Animal&#39; whose meat he ate. It is also possible that he would have show=\r\nered his unseen blessings on the animal&#39;s soul by consuming its meat. It&#39;s =\r\npossible that there were no apparent reasons for that but just a natural in=\r\nconsequential act. We&#39;ll not know. Only Vivekananda, His Guru and Mother Na=\r\nture know. By the way Vivekananda saved a boy from drowning in a lake in US=\r\nA while he was still in India and did not even planned to go to USA. When t=\r\nhe boy, after some years actually met Swami in USA for the first time, swam=\r\ni immediately told him to stay away from water\n&gt;  and when he requested swa=\r\nmi to accept him as his disciple, swami, after a moments thought told him t=\r\nhat he is not his guru and his guru will come later and will give him Silve=\r\nr Cup as a gift. That man later became disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda and=\r\n after 40 years, he was actually given a gift of Silver-cup by Yogananda wh=\r\nich literally fulfilled what swami Vivekananda `knew&#39; before 40 years.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Swami Vivekananda was all knowing and most of us are NOT.\n&gt; \n&gt; So moral of=\r\n my whole writings is that it&#39;s unwise as well as self deluding to take exc=\r\nuses of the unconventional habits of Swami Vivekananda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vi=\r\nmalananda, Gajanana Maharaj, Swami Samarth, Trailang Swami and such masters=\r\n and justify our completely self identified and utterly selfish cruel/unjus=\r\nt actions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@\n&gt;  yaho=\r\nogroups. com, krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal=\r\n Ji,\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Great coincidence of thoughts!!=C3=82=C2=A0I was =\r\nabout to ask this question today on Non-Veg eating.=C3=82=C2=A0 It is clear=\r\n from the below passage meat eating is not advisable for anyone.=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt; I was=C3=82=C2=A0reading a book on Swami Vivekananda (Naa Athma Kad=\r\nha - in Telugu), he clearly wrote that he survived many days on just eating=\r\n meat when he was living in USA also relished it.
