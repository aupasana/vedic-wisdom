We are about 5,000 years into Kali \nyuga and another 427,000 years are left before this cycle ends and \nanother cycle starts.\n\nAs per Krishna&#39;s teachings in SrimadBhagavatam, about 5,000 years at the \nbeginning of Kali yuga will see dharma decay badly on earth. Next 5,000 \nyears will see increasing dharma on earth. After that, dharma will decay \nunchecked. We are at the cusp of decay in dharma stopping and increase \nin dharma starting.\n\nIn the next 5-20 years, there will be big changes on earth. Natural \ndisasters like earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, volcano erruptions \nwill occur more frequently than usual, hit areas dwelt by masses more \nfrequently than usual and happen in such a way as to cause major blows \nto our modern capitalistic civilization. Capitalism as we know it will \ngive way to a more dharmik way of living. Consumption bubble (which is \nthe root cause of all other bubbles we saw - stock market bubble, real \nestate bubble etc) will burst and blatant consumerism will go away. It \nwill be replaced by respect for nature and a more natural and dharmik \nway of living.\n\nThough end of 2012 IS interesting astrologically and the second half of \n2012 will bring some major changes, 2015 and 2016 are more interesting \nand will bring some big changes.\n\nWe are in the middle (near the beginning) of epic geo-political and \ncivilizational changes on earth that happen once every few millennia. \nThough all big changes involves chaos and some destruction of life and \nmaterial things, this change will result in a better and more \nsustainable civilization on earth. This will be good for the future of \nearth.\n\nIndividually, to cope with the changes better in the coming decade, \nincrease your spiritual practices and develop a calm, stable, focused \nand detached mind that can engage in powerful and passionate actions and \nyet be unaffected by the end result of those actions. Whatever we get, \nwhatever happens around us, belongs to god and we are temporary visitors \nhere and caretakers. Enjoy what comes your way, but don&#39;t think it is \nyours. It is god&#39;s. Fully imbibing this attitude requires a lot of \npractice (spiritual sadhana).\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n--- In vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com, &quot;nagaraj1946&quot; &lt;nagaraj1946@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; respected astrologers\n&gt; Many astrologers are predicting the world may come to an end on \n&gt; Dec21,2012. what is the correct psotion and what does the vedic \n&gt; astrology say about this or any reference are there in vedic astrology\n&gt; regards\n&gt; nagaraj\n\n"}}
