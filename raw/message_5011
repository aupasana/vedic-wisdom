Does performing the same \n&gt; sadhana become less effective in giv=\r\ning the goal if done without initially \n&gt; taking the sankalp?\n \nAny mantra =\r\ngives results when one succeeds in focusing mind on it. In addition, if a t=\r\nhought or desire is present in the mind at the time of such focus, i.e. min=\r\nd is focuses on a mantra and a desire and there is nothing else in the mind=\r\n, then it is possible that the mantra works to fulfil the desire.\n \nThe pur=\r\npose of sankalpa is to focus the mind on a thought. Before you start a ritu=\r\nal, you tell yourself what you want. However, it is possible that one who s=\r\naid a sankalpa explicitly forgets about that sankalpa when the mind starts =\r\nget a perfect focus on the mantra. Or one may not even get such focus. On t=\r\nhe other hand, one who meditates on a mantra without a formal sankalpa may =\r\nget a sankalpa in the mind just when one&#39;s mind is about to get perfect foc=\r\nus.\n \nBottomline is that saying sankalpa explicitly is just a formality. If=\r\n a desire is to be fulfilled, one needs to have it at the back of the mind =\r\nduring sadhana and focus enough on the mantra to generate enough kaarmik pu=\r\nsh to fulfil it.\n \n*        *        *\n \nI will narrate an incident, which =\r\nmay throw some light on some related areas.\n \nThere was a sadhaka who was a=\r\nttached to Gayatri mantra, but never did sadhana with Gayatri mantra with a=\r\nny explicit sankalpas. Oneday, a Super bowl match was going on (final Ameri=\r\ncan football match of the season to decide the world champion). The local t=\r\neam of his own city were the favorites and they had won Superbowl a couple =\r\nof times in previous years. They went into Superbowl with a perfect record =\r\nthat season and were expected to win. They were considered an all-time grea=\r\nt team. The opponents were a small-time team that came into finals defying =\r\nall expectations. People thought they were lucky even to be in the Superbow=\r\nl. All the friends and relatives of this sadhaka were obviously rooting for=\r\n the local team. They were all watching the match together at a friend&#39;s ho=\r\nuse. Not being a football fan, this sadhaka stayed home alone. Though he kn=\r\new nothing about football, its teams and its players, he casually picked up=\r\n a name from news and said to a couple of relatives on the previous day tha=\r\nt this person (quarterback, i.e. captain, of the other small team) would do=\r\n well. Of course, he routinely goes wrong in this kind of hunches and he wa=\r\ns casual about it.\n \nWhen the match was going on, the other small team went=\r\n ahead in the last quarter in a low-scoring match. His relatives called him=\r\n and congratulated him saying your team is winning. He said good. With abou=\r\nt 2:45 min left in the game, the local team (favorites) scored a touchdown =\r\nand went ahead. His wife called him then and said that one of the relatives=\r\n was taunting the opponents&#39; quarterback and said some insults about him. T=\r\nhis sadhaka suddenly became angry at a particular insult. He thought, &quot;I sa=\r\nid to them that I liked so and so quarterback and that he will do well. Why=\r\n should they then insult him so much?&quot; Though it is quite irrational for so=\r\nmeone who does not follow the game and just picked up a name and casually p=\r\nraised the name in front of some relatives, he became quite attached to the=\r\n idea that that quarterback should do well and prove his worth. He was quit=\r\ne deluded and felt like *he* was being insulted and taunted and he needed t=\r\no do something.\n \nHe turned on the TV, watched the game for a few seconds, =\r\njust sat down in a meditating posture with eyes closed and back straight an=\r\nd started meditating with Gayatri mantra. Though it would normally take him=\r\n a long time to achieve focus on the mantra, he was able to achieve focus v=\r\nery quickly that particular time. He lost awareness of his body and his min=\r\nd was fully absorbed in the mantra. His mind was reverberating with the man=\r\ntra and the desire that so and so team and its quarterback should do well a=\r\nnd win was still present in the mind as a background thought. Except for th=\r\nat thought and the sound of the mantra, there was pretty much no other thou=\r\nght in the mind.\n \nSuddenly, a thought arose in his mind (from where?): &quot;en=\r\nough now - the job is done&quot;. That thought disturbed the focus and his shakt=\r\ni came down. He was then aware of his body and was aware of his physical su=\r\nrroundings. He opened his eyes and looked at the TV. Some 40-45 seconds wer=\r\ne left in the clock. There was a touchdown within a few seconds and the oth=\r\ner small team went ahead. The game was over.\n \nIn matters like this, cause =\r\nand effect analysis is very difficult and not worth it. This sadhaka may or=\r\n may not have *caused* anything. But, what he experienced when his shakti r=\r\nose and the mind was focused is quite interesting and different from what h=\r\ne would normally experience in such a situation. A communion between onesel=\r\nf, a mantra and a sankalpa was achieved and it was a strange experience. Th=\r\ne way the awareness arose that &quot;the job is done&quot; and the way touchdown happ=\r\nened a few seconds later was interesting.\n \nHowever, that sadhaka was never=\r\n able to replicate that experience again. He consciously tried it with othe=\r\nr sankalpas later, but he either did not achieve mental focus (and the resu=\r\nltant rise of shakti) OR he totally forgot about the sankalpa by the time m=\r\nental focus was achieved and shakti could rise!\n \nHe realized one simple fa=\r\nct slowly. In the normal state of being, one has several sanklapas. But one=\r\n is unable to fulfil them due to the dispersion of mental energy in many di=\r\nrections. In an elevated state of being where the mental energy is focused =\r\nand sankalpas can be fulfilled, one can only think of sankalpas that Nature=\r\n wills one to have and forgets all other sankalpas one may have had before.=\r\n\n \nBottomline: Forget about sankalpas and fulfilling them. Just surrender t=\r\no god and do sadhana. Not to accomplish this or that, but to allow Nature t=\r\no use one to accomplish what *Nature* wants done! There is nothing higher t=\r\nhan submitting oneself to Nature and being an instrument that allows Nature=\r\n to work Her will. Even if one tries to fulfil one&#39;s own will, one cannot g=\r\no against Nature. Synchronizing one&#39;s will with Nature&#39;s will is anyway nee=\r\nded for spiritual progress.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n---------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, F=\r\nree Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritua=\r\nl manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www=\r\n.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiF=\r\nilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  =\r\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n---------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- Bhupe=\r\nndra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Hi All,\n&gt; \n&gt; What is the prim=\r\nary purpose of taking sankalp before proceeding with performing \n&gt; a sadhan=\r\na with the aim a obtaining a desired goal?
