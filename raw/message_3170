Now some more question=\r\ns. \n \n1. Your document says that the Kalasam should be established to the N=\r\north East of the HomaKundam. My fireplace is situated on the eastern side o=\r\nf the house and I will be facing east as I sit, just like how it is preferr=\r\ned. My homakundam is small enough that I can establish the Kalasam also wit=\r\nhin the fire-place to the North East of the Homa Kundam and The Ganapathi I=\r\ndol also right in front of the Kalasam, within the fireplace. Is it okay to=\r\n do it this way or should the Kalasam and Ganapathi Idol should be out side=\r\n of the fire-place? If they should be outside, then there is no way the Kal=\r\nasam could be to the North East if the HomaKundam. \n \n2. In the poorvagam (=\r\npreliminary offering) on page 17, the second mantra, &quot;Om Indraya Swaha! Ind=\r\nrayEdam Namama&quot; should be done pouring the ghee from the SouthWest to North=\r\nEast, according to the document. This should be done with the Shruk (Big Sp=\r\noon) according to the system that I learnt for our Sharmaji. Other than thi=\r\ns, everywhere else I am just using the small spoon only, even in that syste=\r\nm. I did not know that these (Shruk and Shruvam) are representing the male =\r\nand female elements. Can you shed more light on the subject, as to what is =\r\nthe inner meaning of using these two spoons etc? \n \n3. One other small aspe=\r\nct that I noticed is there is a certain kriya where the water in the Shuddi=\r\n Patra should be pushed from west to east (three times) with the pavitram a=\r\nnd pavitram is eventually made knot-free and put in the fire after dipping =\r\nin the ghee. This is something I did not find in your document. Could you p=\r\nlease explain the meaning of this and why this was skipped in the document.=\r\n In fact, your document does not mention the suddhi patra separately other =\r\nthan the Kalasam. Or is it that the Kalasam and the Shuddhi Patra are same?=\r\n I am a bit confused. The Shuddi patra, the Aajya Patra, the Shruk and Shru=\r\nvam make it Chatushpatra Prayogam, as I understand. Is there a different na=\r\nme for the prayogam that you documented? I know you tried to simplify the w=\r\nhole thing, but anyway, if I understand these finer aspects, I feel better.=\r\n \n \nI hope you will be willing to answer these simple questions and if not,=\r\n please let me know why not! \n\nWith Regards, \n \n \nNagraj\n \n\n\n"}}
