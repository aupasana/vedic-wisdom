We cannot\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n trust that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; every standard convention is based on sound knowledge.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; One of my favorite sooktas is &quot;Devi So=\r\noktam&quot; from Rigveda. It is\n&gt; &gt; attributed\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to Vagambhrani, a female ris=\r\nhi. She felt oneness with the Divine\n&gt; &gt; Mother in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Her undivided supre=\r\nme form (nearly nirguna form) and the riks of\n&gt; &gt; Devi\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sooktam were re=\r\nvealed to her then. Those eight riks are really\n&gt; &gt; fantastic.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Th=\r\nere are other riks in Rigveda that were revealed to the world \nby\n&gt; &gt; femal=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt;&gt; rishis. We use those riks in our worship, meditation, homas and\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nother\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sadhanas. Yet, should we insist that women cannot recite Veda? I=\r\nf\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Vagambhrani is amid us again as a woman, should we stop her from\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n reciting\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Devi sooktam?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Jnanes=\r\nhwar (or Jnanadev) was a great saint from Maharashtra from\n&gt; &gt; about 800\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; years back. He was a great devotee of Krishna and was a fully \nself-\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n realized\n&gt; &gt;&gt; master at a young age. He reformed religion and corrected so=\r\nme\n&gt; &gt; corrupt\n&gt; &gt;&gt; traditions. He once made a buffalo chant Veda.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; He started to recite Veda and the head of the Brahmin council\n&gt; &gt; forbade=\r\n him\n&gt; &gt;&gt; because he was not &quot;qualified&quot; to recite Veda. Jnaneshwar \ninsist=\r\ned\n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; everyone had a right to recite Veda and the head of the co=\r\nuncil\n&gt; &gt; disagreed.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; As he started reciting Veda, the Brahmins tried t=\r\no stop him by\n&gt; &gt; closing his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mouth. Then a buffalo standing next to h=\r\nim took over and chanted\n&gt; &gt; Veda.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Astounded by the miracle, the Brahm=\r\nins fell at his feet. The head\n&gt; &gt; apologized\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and said, &quot;we are masque=\r\nrading as the keepers of Veda, but you \nhave\n&gt; &gt; the real\n&gt; &gt;&gt; understandin=\r\ng and mastery of Veda&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Jnaneshwar taught the equality of all and=\r\n did not distinguish\n&gt; &gt; between people\n&gt; &gt;&gt; based on caste, creed or gende=\r\nr. He considered BhagavadGita as \nthe\n&gt; &gt; essence\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of Veda and wrote a =\r\nfantastic commentary on it. His commentary\n&gt; &gt; departs from\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the standa=\r\nrd Dwaitic (dualistic) point of view adopted by most\n&gt; &gt; Vaishnava\n&gt; &gt;&gt; gur=\r\nus and uses a purely Adwaitic (non-dualistic) point of view. \nIt\n&gt; &gt; is a\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; priceless and timeless masterpiece.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; One Swamiji who was at my house last month had an interesting \ntake.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; He said\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that the belief that women cannot recite Vedas is based on =\r\na\n&gt; &gt;&gt; misinterpretation. He said that the physical body we have is \ncalled=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;stree sareera&quot; and the inner body we have is called the &quot;pur=\r\nusha\n&gt; &gt; sareera&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; He said that the physical body comes from mother an=\r\nd the soul \ncomes\n&gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt;&gt; father and that is why they are called so. =\r\nThe soul or inner self\n&gt; &gt; is the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thousand-headed purusha within us (d=\r\nescribed in purusha sooktam).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; He said that Veda is supposed to be=\r\n recited with the purusha\n&gt; &gt; sareera.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; According to him, it does not m=\r\nean that women cannot read it.\n&gt; &gt; Whether men or\n&gt; &gt;&gt; women, they have to =\r\nread it with the purusha sareera, i.e. inner\n&gt; &gt; body, and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; not just wi=\r\nth the physical body. So, according to him, the \nstandard\n&gt; &gt;&gt; convention i=\r\ns based on a flawed understanding. According to him,\n&gt; &gt; one simply\n&gt; &gt;&gt; re=\r\nciting Veda with the mouth without the correct internal\n&gt; &gt; understanding i=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt;&gt; only reading with the &quot;stree sareera&quot; and hence not doing the \nright=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; thing.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; In fact, reciting Veda =\r\nand chanting the verses is one thing and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; understanding them is quite a=\r\nnother. When we make sound, there \nare\n&gt; &gt; four\n&gt; &gt;&gt; levels of it - vaikhar=\r\ni, madhyama, pasyanti and para. Vibration \nof\n&gt; &gt; material\n&gt; &gt;&gt; belonging t=\r\no the gross body (sthoola sareera) produces vaikhari\n&gt; &gt; level of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; soun=\r\nd and it is heard through the senses belonging to the gross\n&gt; &gt; body (ears)=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; But vibrations at the level of subtle body (sookshma sareera) and\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; vibrations\n&gt; &gt;&gt; at the level of astral body (kaarana sareera) are also th=\r\nere and\n&gt; &gt; can be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; perceived thorough subtle perception.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If =\r\none is chanting &quot;Om Namo Narayanaya&quot; and thinking of some\n&gt; &gt; mundane\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nmatters, the vibrations produced at levels above vaikhari will \nnot\n&gt; &gt; be\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; auspicious. There is so much stress on what we do physically and\n&gt; &gt; p=\r\neople\n&gt; &gt;&gt; forget that what happens at the other layers of existence is\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n equally, if not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; more, important!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If you produce the correct=\r\n vibrations at all levels (not just\n&gt; &gt; physical)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; while &quot;reciting&quot; any=\r\n Vedic mantra, you can truly &quot;experience&quot; the\n&gt; &gt; mantra. A\n&gt; &gt;&gt; full exper=\r\nience of a single Vedic mantra may be sufficient to \nalter\n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;&gt; l=\r\nife! The mantras of Veda are most powerful. Unfortunately, so \nmuch\n&gt; &gt; of =\r\nVedic\n&gt; &gt;&gt; scholarship these days is only superficial (but it has to be\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n encouraged,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; because it will keep atleast one level of knowledge alive=\r\n).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Forget the man vs woman controversy. The difference between \ng=\r\nenders\n&gt; &gt; is only\n&gt; &gt;&gt; in the gross body. When you go to the subtle body a=\r\nnd astral \nbody,\n&gt; &gt; there is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; no difference at all. One should realize=\r\n that the role of gross\n&gt; &gt; body is too\n&gt; &gt;&gt; limited in the correct recitat=\r\nion/experience of a Vedic mantra. \nIt\n&gt; &gt; is the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; purity of the subtle =\r\nbody and the lightness of the astral body \nthat\n&gt; &gt; are far\n&gt; &gt;&gt; more impor=\r\ntant.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; To be fair and balanced, I ne=\r\ned to throw light on the other \nangle.\n&gt; &gt; Like I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; said, Vedic mantras =\r\nare too powerful. They are capable of \nproducing\n&gt; &gt; a full\n&gt; &gt;&gt; self-reali=\r\nzation (actually the sole purpose of Veda is &quot;to know\n&gt; &gt; self&quot;).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Howe=\r\nver, given the depth of Kali Yuga, it is difficult for it to\n&gt; &gt; come in on=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt;&gt; shot. It comes in steps. When one is half way down the path, one\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n has to be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; careful and under the vigilant guidance of a sadguru.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; When one is not fully realized and the gross body has a role to\n&gt; &gt; pl=\r\nay, there\n&gt; &gt;&gt; are some differences based on the gender that come into play=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If a lady carrying a baby in her womb has certain spiritual\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n experiences\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (which a good Vedic chanting is capable of bringing), the=\r\nre can\n&gt; &gt; even be an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; abortion (or a great siddha being born, on the o=\r\nther extreme).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; There is another subtle factor. Good Vedic chantin=\r\ng can bring an\n&gt; &gt; awakening\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of Kundalini (i.e. an awakening of self-a=\r\nwareness) and an ascent \nof\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Kundalini (i.e. an ascent of self-awarenes=\r\ns). Though some people\n&gt; &gt; may have a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; wrong impression about Kundalini=\r\n because of the corrupt practices\n&gt; &gt; of a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; section of so-called &quot;Kunda=\r\nlini sadhakas&quot;, the fact is that\n&gt; &gt; Kundalini merely\n&gt; &gt;&gt; represents one&#39;s=\r\n ego-consciousness. When one casually associates\n&gt; &gt; the body\n&gt; &gt;&gt; one sees=\r\n with &quot;self&quot;, Kundalini is asleep in the Mooladhara \nchakra.\n&gt; &gt; As one&#39;s\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; self-awareness becomes more and more refined, Kundalini ascends \nin\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sookshma sareera. As one has a perfect self-realization, \nKundali=\r\nni\n&gt; &gt; reaches\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sahasrara. Whether one thinks in these terms or not, Ku=\r\nndalini\n&gt; &gt; moves based\n&gt; &gt;&gt; on how evolved one is. Whether one is into Bha=\r\nkti yoga or Raja \nyoga\n&gt; &gt; or Karma\n&gt; &gt;&gt; yoga or Jnana yoga does not matter=\r\n. All paths lead to an \nawareness\n&gt; &gt; of a more\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and more correct conce=\r\npt of self as time progresses and a full\n&gt; &gt;&gt; self-realization finally. Acc=\r\nordingly, Kundalini rises more and\n&gt; &gt; more and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; reaches Sahasrara at t=\r\nhe end.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; During the period when Kundalini is stuck in Swadhishthan=\r\na \nchakra,\n&gt; &gt; sexual\n&gt; &gt;&gt; drive can multiply. Several yogis get stuck in t=\r\nhis stage and \nfail\n&gt; &gt; the tests\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to progress further. In general, wom=\r\nen have a higher drive than\n&gt; &gt; men. If that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; drive multiplies, there c=\r\nan be a difficult situation. However, it\n&gt; &gt; really\n&gt; &gt;&gt; depends on the ind=\r\nividual and we cannot generalize.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Thus, there are some practical =\r\ndifficulties on the way, which may\n&gt; &gt; have made\n&gt; &gt;&gt; some people come up w=\r\nith some rules. However, are those issues\n&gt; &gt; sufficient to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ban women =\r\nfrom reciting Veda? I don&#39;t think so. In fact, the\n&gt; &gt; factors I wrote\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n above are probably irrelevant given the superficial understanding\n&gt; &gt; of V=\r\neda\n&gt; &gt;&gt; present at this time and the superficial recitation of Veda that \n=\r\nwe\n&gt; &gt; find\n&gt; &gt;&gt; these days.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; But, if you want to be sure and do n=\r\not want to misguide anyone, \nit\n&gt; &gt; is better\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to not give any advice. =\r\nLeave it to one&#39;s sadguru. If you have a\n&gt; &gt; sadguru who\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is guiding yo=\r\nur spiritual sadhana, surrender and do as your guru\n&gt; &gt; says! What\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is =\r\ngood for goose may not be good for gander. What goose&#39;s guru\n&gt; &gt; taught to\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; goose may be good only for goose and not for gander. Gander will \ndo\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; well to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; follow gander&#39;s guru.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I think I rambled enough fo=\r\nr today... :-)\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ----------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Homam manual and audi=\r\no: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): ht=\r\ntp://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http=\r\n://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://=\r\nwww.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; -------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt;&gt; From: &quot;rohinip=\r\nurang&quot; &lt;rohinipurang@&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sent: S=\r\naturday, February 24, 2007 12:18 PM\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] reading/le=\r\narning the veda\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;A warm namaste to everyone!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I=\r\n have heard it said that women are not allowed to\n&gt; &gt; read/know/recite the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; vedas.
