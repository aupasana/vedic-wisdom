Most of us assume that this is only applicabl=\r\ne in mundane\nmatters. This is applicable in the path of spirituality too. I=\r\n know\nthere are people who think that any affair/process related to God mus=\r\nt\nbe done perfectly. Honestly ... unless one is an adept, this is\nimpossibl=\r\ne and only repeated and sincere attempts makes one an adept.\n\nReminds me of=\r\n the great Kalidasa who worshipped Goddess Mahakali for\nnine lives and he w=\r\nas born a dunce in his tenth and she appeared to\nhim in his 10th lifetime, =\r\nwhen his sadhana was complete and he banged\nhis head out of sheer frustrati=\r\non. Imagine!!! In Kaliyuga, along with\nHoma, surrendering to ones chosen de=\r\nity is the best path for most. \n\nLet me share one incident, when Narasimha&#39;=\r\ns spiritual Guru whom I also\nconsider my Guru, asked me (when we were in Ch=\r\nennai for Shata Chandi\nHoma) to learn Mahaganapthi homam, I thought he was =\r\nreally joking!\nWhen I got back to the US, he called me again and reminded m=\r\ne. It then\noccured to me he was really being serious. So, I started searchi=\r\nng on\nthe net and I found a really flimsy document, but nevertheless I took=\r\n\nit up and performed it. But, I was not satisfied.  Manishji then\nreminded =\r\nme of the book he gifted me, but even in that it was entirely\nin Samskrit a=\r\nnd illiterate that I am, I couldn&#39;t distinguish between\nan instruction and =\r\nsloka :). Around this time, Narasimha occasionally\nperformed a longer versi=\r\non of the homam and I particpated in it, but\nnever could grasp it. I then a=\r\nsked Narasimha to guide me, which he\ndid, but still it did not get through =\r\nmy really dense brains :). I\nfelt really helpless, but the stars were such =\r\nthat I never gave up,\ninstead I made a sincere prayer to Lord Ganesha, that=\r\n If he really\nintends that I perform the homa, then he should kindly show m=\r\ne the\nway. In around two weeks time, Narasimha told me that he has decided\n=\r\nto document the Laghu (Short) paddhati of the homa. I just couldnt\nbelieve =\r\nmy luck and thanked the Elephant-headed omnipotent for his\ngrace. Well ... =\r\nits been exactly 2yrs and I am still at it taking\nbaby-steps and making pro=\r\ngress everyday.\n\nI thank Manishji, Narasimha and the all the divine forces =\r\nfor helping\nme progress.\n\nMy request, pls dont give it up, persist with it =\r\nno matter what. We\nare humans and prone to mistakes. But then nobody got pe=\r\nrfect the very\nfirst time, unless he has worked on it a lot in his previous=\r\n lives.\nIts all a continuum. Dont worry about time, we have future lives ..=\r\n.\nplenty of time. These things take their own sweet time, doesnt happen\nove=\r\nrnight. No matter what, complete your homa everyday, that should be\nthe pri=\r\nmary goal ... nothing else. Pls dont waver from it, whether you\nget or dont=\r\n get anything. Slowly we&#39;ll progress in our Sadhana and\nmove on to higher t=\r\nhings. I wish all the best. We should really thank\nour stars that people li=\r\nke Manishji and Narasimhaji are here guiding\nus ... what would be life with=\r\nout them!\n\nThanks for listening.\nRegards\n-Narayan-\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Garu !=\r\n!!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;A servant carrying a million dollar check to the bank and cashing =\r\nit \n&gt; &gt;is NOT superior to a servant carrying a $100 check to the bank and \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;cashing it.

A servant simply serves the master. Simila=\r\nrly, all the \n&gt; sadhana you do and your other activities are your way to se=\r\nrve your \n&gt; master.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; A rich landlord may be very wealthy and have =\r\nmany big checks \n&gt; everyday to cash and also many big checks everyday to ma=\r\nil others. \n&gt; Yet, he may need a servant to physically carry papers to the =\r\nbank and \n&gt; do the needful. Similarly, god is capable of doing anything in =\r\nthis \n&gt; world and yet god needs human beings who execute god&#39;s agenda in th=\r\nis \n&gt; world. That is why various gods (including Vishnu himself) and \n&gt; var=\r\nious rishis keep coming back to earth every now and then. The \n&gt; supreme go=\r\nd of this world operates through various physical persons \n&gt; present on ear=\r\nth.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; We do homam and other spiritual sadhana, purify ourselves and=\r\n try \n&gt; to help others, because that is god&#39;s work. Just as a servant carri=\r\nes \n&gt; master&#39;s papers to the bank, we do such work for god.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Doing=\r\n what is applauded by others as good work tends to promote ego \n&gt; and we ne=\r\ned to guard against it. A servant carrying a million dollar \n&gt; check to the=\r\n bank and cashing it is NOT superior to a servant \n&gt; carrying a $100 check =\r\nto the bank and cashing it. Both are merely \n&gt; doing their master&#39;s work an=\r\nd do not own anything. Both are just \n&gt; *instruments* used by the master to=\r\n carry out his agenda. Similarly, \n&gt; one who does what are considered great=\r\n deeds in this world and one \n&gt; who does what are considered meagre deeds i=\r\nn this world are both \n&gt; servants of god helping god execute god&#39;s agenda i=\r\nn this world. \n&gt; Neither really owns anything. One may consider oneself sup=\r\nerior to \n&gt; the other because his/her deeds are considered superior by the =\r\nworld, \n&gt; but he/she is just as foolish as a servant who considers \n&gt; himse=\r\nlf/herself superior to another servant carrying something less \n&gt; valuable.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; If this attitude of being a servant of god fully penetrates one&#39;=\r\ns \n&gt; attitude, thinking and instincts, one is safe no matter what \n&gt; situat=\r\nions his previous karmas place one in. One can remain happy and \n&gt; blissful=\r\n in pleasure and pain, in praise and criticism and in light \n&gt; and darkness=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Have the same attitude towards your sadhana like homam. It is a=\r\n job \n&gt; you are doing for god. You do the best you can. But you own nothing=\r\n. \n&gt; You are doing it for god.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; --=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do a S=\r\nhort Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarp=\r\nanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: htt=\r\np://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): htt=\r\np://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www=\r\n.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------- \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt;   From: rajarsh=\r\ni nandy \n&gt; &gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt;   Sent: Thursday, Dece=\r\nmber 04, 2008 12:47 AM\n&gt; &gt;   Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Regarding Maha Gan=\r\napati Homam\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         Dear Narasimhaji\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         Reading your=\r\n response another question came into my mind. \n&gt; You said:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;        =\r\n  It is not good if fire is extinguished by rain in the \n&gt; middle of a homa=\r\nm.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         Is it not good that the fire gets extinguished by rain,=\r\n or \n&gt; the fact that the fire is getting extinguished?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         I m=\r\nean actyually i feel when someone starts doing homa \n&gt; regularly, there can=\r\n be instances when the homa agni gets \n&gt; extinguished while the homa is sti=\r\nll on..happened with me couple of \n&gt; times... i seriously dont knbow what t=\r\no make of it but as one member \n&gt; in this list had suggested to me,  i reli=\r\nght the fire and keep \n&gt; continuing with the homa.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         -Regard=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt;          Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;          \n&gt; &gt;         The upsurg=\r\ne (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         --- On=\r\n Thu, 4/12/08, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           From: Nar=\r\nasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; &gt;           Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Regarding M=\r\naha Ganapati Homam\n&gt; &gt;           To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;      =\r\n     Cc: &quot;Phanikumar Velaga&quot; &lt;itsverysimple@&gt;\n&gt; &gt;           Date: Thursday,=\r\n 4 December, 2008, 6:48 AM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           Namaste Phani,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n          &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of a house(3-\n&gt; floors=\r\n) ? Can a homam\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; kundam made by arranging red bricks, with s=\r\nand base be \n&gt; used instead of a\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; copper one?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;      =\r\n     Yes, you can do it on a rooftop. Doing it in the open is \n&gt; actually b=\r\netter than doing it in closed space. But realize that a \n&gt; rain can cause p=\r\nroblems. Keep an umbrella around to protect the fire \n&gt; if it rains while y=\r\nou are doing homam. It is not good if fire is \n&gt; extinguished by rain in th=\r\ne middle of a homam.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           Yes, you can construct a homa kunda=\r\nm with bricks and sand \n&gt; at the bottom. Use a square shaped huma kunda.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; 2)While performing the Homam using the mp3 audio file, \n=\r\n&gt; should one repeat the\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; mantras mentally along with the aud=\r\nio?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           One can repeat mentally while listening attentively =\r\n(not \n&gt; casually). Actually, even listening to mantras with all the attenti=\r\non \n&gt; focused is as powerful as saying mantras.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           Suppose =\r\nperson X is chanting a mantra and thinking of \n&gt; some mundane matter in the=\r\n mind. Suppose person Y is listening to it \n&gt; with focus and thinking of th=\r\ne mantra and its deity. Then the mantra \n&gt; may do nothing for person X and =\r\nyet person Y may benefit from the \n&gt; mantra. The word mantra means &quot;one tha=\r\nt protects the mind&quot;.. One can \n&gt; say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be=\r\n protected. The key is \n&gt; control over the mind and keeping the mind focuse=\r\nd on the mantra.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           However, there is a difference between =\r\nmeditation and \n&gt; homam. Mantra is submitted in the internal fire in medita=\r\ntion and it \n&gt; is submitted in the external fire as well in a homam. So mak=\r\ning some \n&gt; external sound (even if feeble) is a good idea as opposed to si=\r\nlent \n&gt; chanting or just listening. Try to repeat slowly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         =\r\n  &gt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Other \n&gt; conditions/niyamas=\r\n that\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; should be followed apart from having vegeterain food?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           Yes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread ceremony) =\r\n\n&gt; has been performed can do it. Bachelor or married is irrelevant.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;           One should follow the yamas and niyamas set by one&#39;s \n&gt; guru. W=\r\nhatever rules one&#39;s guru sets, one should follow them \n&gt; strictly. At the m=\r\ninimum, one should eat only vegetarian food on the \n&gt; day of homam and take=\r\n a bath before homam. Another rule I will \n&gt; recommend is to avoid eating a=\r\nny solid food 2 hours before homam.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           By the way, if one w=\r\nithout a sacred thread wants to do \n&gt; homam for spiritual progress, I am wi=\r\nlling to take responsibility and \n&gt; allow them to do it. Such a person can =\r\nthink of me or my guru as guru \n&gt; and perform homam. I am willing to take o=\r\nn any karma incurred in the \n&gt; process until the person crosses some minimu=\r\nm threshhold of purity \n&gt; through homam and other spiritual practices. Sacr=\r\ned thread or no \n&gt; sacred thread, mantropadesa or no mantropadesa, it does =\r\nnot matter \n&gt; after a while, when the person crosses a threshhold of purity=\r\n. The \n&gt; goal of upanayanam and other mantropadesa by guru is to speed this=\r\n up \n&gt; and make the person cross the threshhold of purity.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;        =\r\n   As long as one desires no specific material benefits (and \n&gt; ready to re=\r\nceive whatever god gives) and does homam for spiritual \n&gt; progress, I am wi=\r\nlling to help, even if it means some suffering for \n&gt; me.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         =\r\n  &gt; 4)Any good date to start the Homam? or any day would be \n&gt; fine?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;           For Mahaganapathi homam, the best is a Chaturthi morning. \n&gt; B=\r\nut any day is fine really.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           Ment=\r\nioning rain and rooftop homam reminded me of my India \n&gt; trip.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    =\r\n       When I went to India in May 2008, I and my guru Manish \n&gt; traveled t=\r\nogether to several places (on a specific project). We ended \n&gt; up doing hom=\r\nam in the morning in several places (wherever we were). \n&gt; Before the trip,=\r\n my guru told me to carry an umbrella with me. As \n&gt; monsoons come only in =\r\nJune/July in India, I did not take it \n&gt; seriously. We were in New Delhi in=\r\n mid-May.. We proceeded to the \n&gt; rooftop of the apartment complex we were =\r\nin, to do a homam. Manish \n&gt; told me, &quot;Narasimha, it is going to rain heavi=\r\nly in this city after \n&gt; our homam finishes&quot;. I just smiled.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;      =\r\n     To my surprise, it did rain as soon as our homas \n&gt; finished. After we=\r\n offered poornaahuti, it suddenly started raining \n&gt; with really big drops.=\r\n Luckily, there was a small towel/blanket on \n&gt; the rooftop close to us. To=\r\ngether, we held it on top of the two small \n&gt; homa kundas, closed our eyes =\r\nand meditated. We held the cloth cover \n&gt; on the homa kundas until fire in =\r\nthe two homa kundas went off and \n&gt; then packed everything and went down. W=\r\ne left for Kurukshetra later \n&gt; that day, but we were told that a heavy rai=\r\nn continued for a few days \n&gt; in New Delhi. In fact, rain followed us on th=\r\nat trip as we covered \n&gt; the north, east and west of India.
