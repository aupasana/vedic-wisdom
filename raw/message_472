If you d=\r\no not know the \nright deity, just doing some sadhana is definitely better t=\r\nhan waiting. Pick \nwhatever deity seems natural to you and do sadhana.\n\nPle=\r\nase remember that sadhana for spiritual progress is different from \nsadhana=\r\n for specific material benefits. No matter which deity you worship, \nsadhan=\r\na performed for spiritual progress never goes waste. However, \nsometimes it=\r\n may be necessary to experience the results of some bad karmas \nbefore some=\r\n good things happen. Imagine all your karmas lying in a pile in a \nbasket. =\r\nSuppose some of the really good karmas that will enable you to do \nserious =\r\nsadhana and experience great things lie at the bottom or middle of \nthe pil=\r\ne. When you start sadhana, suppose god decides to give you the fruits \nof t=\r\nhose auspicious karmas. Imagine him reaching into the pile and \nretrieving =\r\nthose karmas. In the process, some other karmas may spill over \nand give th=\r\neir fruits. Some of those may be undesirable. So what? They had \nto be expe=\r\nrienced sometime or the other, anyway!\n\nA serious sadhaka should never be d=\r\nisheartened by a few seemingly \nundesirable results after starting a spirit=\r\nual sadhana. Just keep going.\n\nOne gentleman I know received mantra for Kaa=\r\nli from a very good \npriest-cum-yogi in late 2005. After he did the mantra =\r\nfor a few days, he was \nlaid off and lost his job. He was not perturbed. He=\r\n continued his sadhana \nand used the break to go on an extended trip to Ind=\r\nia and make a pilgrimage \nto some nice places. He participated in the Shata=\r\n Chandi homam we conducted \nat the Kaalikambal temple in Chennai in March 2=\r\n006. He met my guru and got \nthe opportunity to be his room mate for a week=\r\n when we stayed at the house \nof a priest during the homam. He could observ=\r\ne and interact with my guru \nvery closely. Most importantly, when my guru h=\r\nad a vision of the Mother on \n2006 March 3 afternoon, in which She told him=\r\n to start the work on spreading \nhomam in the world, this gentleman was pre=\r\nsent there. Though he could not \nsee the Mother, he actually smelled someth=\r\ning out of the world and was \nbaffled. He knew something was going on, but =\r\ndid not know what. The temple \nwas closed at the time and my guru and this =\r\ngentlemen were the only people \non the premises when the Mother appeared. E=\r\nven though he could not see the \nMother, it was most fortunate of him to be=\r\n present there at *that* crucial \nmoment. That is enough to mould the rest =\r\nof his life.\n\nYou never know how, when and where the grace of god falls on =\r\nyou. \nCalculations and logic are useless when it comes to the grace of god.=\r\n Just \nsurrender and keep doing whatever sadhana you picked. If it needs \nf=\r\nine-tuning, somebody will appear to tell you that. Any bad things that \nhap=\r\npen when doing a spiritual sadhana should be viewed as nature settling \nsom=\r\ne debts so that you are prepared to receive the fruits of some really \nausp=\r\nicious karmas.\n\nAs Shirdi Sai Baba says, you should have &quot;sraddha and sabur=\r\ni&quot;. Have devotion \nand patience. There is no limit to what you can get then=\r\n.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org=\r\n/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpan=\r\na\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish =\r\nlessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (=\r\nWindows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) websit=\r\ne: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- --------- =\r\n--------- --------- - \n\n----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; Namaste Sir\n&gt; what =\r\nyou said makes a lot sense and it was marvellous\n&gt; but i have some small do=\r\nubts\n&gt;\n&gt; Leaving astrology aside and those who do not have a guru\n&gt; how can=\r\n they chooose a particular form of GOD\n&gt; bcoz in second part of AGHORA, Vim=\r\nalanda, said choosing right deity\n&gt; is very important, as the analogy he ga=\r\nve of a person\n&gt; who is greedy and worships LAKSHMI , may increase his gree=\r\nd\n&gt;\n&gt; One thing more\n&gt; we have so many deities that on diwali i would like =\r\nto worship\n&gt; Lakshmi and Kali\n&gt; in navaratri (nowadays) we would worship Du=\r\nrga\n&gt; on janmashtami we would fast for KRISHNA\n&gt; an on MAHASHIVARATRI for S=\r\nHIVA\n&gt; like this\n&gt; with hte change in festival the deity changes\n&gt;\n&gt; though=\r\n everybody knows GOD is ONE but it becomes difficult to get\n&gt; out of this\n&gt;=\r\n mould and if i didnt worship her may be that GOD/GODDESS may become\n&gt; angr=\r\ny\n&gt;\n&gt; I Know,this is my foolishness but stiil this thing hangs in the mind\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; One thing more\n&gt;\n&gt; Suppose if i choose a deity and something wrong happ=\r\nens\n&gt; (materiallistically )\n&gt;\n&gt; what should i consider that my deity was he=\r\nlping me to clear my\n&gt; DEBTS/WRONG DEEDS\n&gt; or the NATURE was telling me to =\r\nchange the DEITY as I am not fit\n&gt; for that DEITY\n&gt;\n&gt; and sometimes you fee=\r\nl\n&gt; o what am i doing does this really works\n&gt;\n&gt; and one thing more\n&gt;\n&gt; wha=\r\nt if we go on doing our pooja and someday\n&gt; something like what happened to=\r\n Pt.

I will\n&gt; continue in\n&gt;&gt; the same vein for a little more time.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I ha=\r\nd a dream a couple of years ago early in the morning. In the\n&gt; dream,\n&gt;&gt; th=\r\nere was a big ritual fire. My guru Manish Pandit and I were\n&gt; sitting in\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n front of the fire. He was teaching me some pranayama techniques in\n&gt; the\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; dream. Suddenly, he changed into somebody else that I could not\n&gt; recogni=\r\nze.\n&gt;&gt; It was not anybody I had seen before.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I mentioned this dream t=\r\no my guru after a couple of weeks. First\n&gt; he said he\n&gt;&gt; did not know who t=\r\nhe other person was and said he would&#39;ve\n&gt; probably known if\n&gt;&gt; I had menti=\r\noned the dream soon after it had happened. I left it\n&gt; there.\n&gt;&gt; However, w=\r\nhen we talked in the next weekend, he referred to my\n&gt; dream and\n&gt;&gt; said he=\r\n had an idea who it was. He gave me a name and asked me to\n&gt; search on\n&gt;&gt; t=\r\nhe internet for his photo and see if he was the person I saw in\n&gt; my dream.=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; It was a guru from the lineage of Paramahamsa Yogananda (before\n&gt; him).=\r\n Though\n&gt;&gt; he is apparently well-known, I was not knowledegable about this\n=\r\n&gt; lineage and\n&gt;&gt; did not see his picture before. I searched on the internet=\r\n and\n&gt; found a\n&gt;&gt; photo. Interestingly, the photo was very close to the per=\r\nson I saw\n&gt; in my\n&gt;&gt; dream. The person that Manish transformed into in my d=\r\nream looked\n&gt; like a\n&gt;&gt; slightly younger version of that photo.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When =\r\nI confirmed this to Manish, he only smiled and\n&gt; said, &quot;Narasimha, there\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n are so many links between various lineages. Leave it for now.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Of co=\r\nurse, I do not know much about kriya yoga or about the\n&gt; lineage of\n&gt;&gt; Para=\r\nmahamsa Yogananda. Our lineage of this life starts from\n&gt; Dattatreya. We\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n have a special attachment to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and his\n&gt; lineage and=\r\n got\n&gt;&gt; a lot of our knowledge, inspiration and perhaps experience from\n&gt; t=\r\nhem. We do\n&gt;&gt; not have any direct link to the lineage of Paramahamsa Yogana=\r\nnda.\n&gt; But,\n&gt;&gt; Manish thought there were some other indirect links. Moreove=\r\nr, he\n&gt; guessed\n&gt;&gt; who I saw, even though I myself had no idea who I saw, a=\r\nnd he\n&gt; guessed\n&gt;&gt; correctly. That should count for something!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I will=\r\n not be surprised if there are indeed subtle connections\n&gt; between\n&gt;&gt; sever=\r\nal lineages that seem disjoint today.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; By the way, Swami Vivekananda a=\r\nlso appeared in the prison cell of\n&gt; Sri\n&gt;&gt; Aurobindo (who wrote brilliant =\r\ncommentaries on Veda and Upanishad)\n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; imparted him some Adwaita know=\r\nledge to Sri Aurobindo.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; An interesting coincidence is tha=\r\nt a swamiji from Puri contacted\n&gt; me within a\n&gt;&gt; few days after I saw that =\r\nphoto. His guru and Paramahamsa\n&gt; Yogananda were\n&gt;&gt; co-disciples of the sam=\r\ne guru (Yukteshwar Maharaj). He is the\n&gt; keeper of\n&gt;&gt; some astrological kno=\r\nwledge that his guru received from Yukteshwar\n&gt; Maharaj.\n&gt;&gt; He visited me a=\r\nfter a month, discussed that knowledge and spent a\n&gt; day at my\n&gt;&gt; house. Th=\r\nus, some small connection was made with a representative\n&gt; of that\n&gt;&gt; linea=\r\nge soon after the dream. After all, some karmik debts may\n&gt; have been\n&gt;&gt; th=\r\nere...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I want to make one thing clear.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Some things =\r\nI mention like this may give the impression that my\n&gt; guru has\n&gt;&gt; some psyc=\r\nhic abilities or siddhis. That may indeed be true. But he\n&gt; always\n&gt;&gt; downp=\r\nlays those things and attaches no importance whatsoever. He\n&gt; says,\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Nar=\r\nasimha, I am a useless person and lower than dirt and capable\n&gt; of\n&gt;&gt; nothi=\r\nng. It is all Her power. She is the connection between every\n&gt; entity in\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n this universe. She may choose an idiot like me as an instrument\n&gt; sometime=\r\ns\n&gt;&gt; and do something using me. I have no special abilities of any\n&gt; kind. =\r\nAny\n&gt;&gt; coincidences you find are just Her grace and not due to me.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I=\r\n realized in time that this simplicity, humility and lack of ego\n&gt; is not\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; fake. I also realized that this lack of ego is what enabled him to\n&gt; do t=\r\nhings\n&gt;&gt; that sound impossible or difficult. In fact, I realized that many\n=\r\n&gt; great\n&gt;&gt; saints in the past were like this. Several magical things happen=\r\ned\n&gt; through\n&gt;&gt; them, but they did not find any pride in them and retained =\r\ntheir\n&gt; humility\n&gt;&gt; and sense of surrender to their chosen form of god and =\r\nbelieved\n&gt; that god\n&gt;&gt; was the doer of all things and they were mere instru=\r\nments.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The day you also start believing that, not for the sake of\n&gt; l=\r\necturing or\n&gt;&gt; posturing, but from the deep cores of your heart, your sadha=\r\nna\n&gt; will bear\n&gt;&gt; fruit.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------ -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Your=\r\nself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself:=\r\n http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. y=\r\nahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicas=\r\ntro. home.comcast. net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Vedic=\r\nAst rologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan =\r\nnath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- =\r\n- \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Dinesh Nambisan&quot; &lt;dinesh@.=\r\n..&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Monday, September 29, =\r\n2008 5:54 PM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Yogananda (Re: Dharma)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ---=\r\n In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

If you do not kno=\r\nw the &lt;BR&gt;right deity, just doing some sadhana is definitely better than wa=\r\niting. Pick &lt;BR&gt;whatever deity seems natural to you and do sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nPlease remember that sadhana for spiritual progress is different from &lt;BR&gt;s=\r\nadhana for specific material benefits. No matter which deity you worship, &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;sadhana performed for spiritual progress never goes waste. However, &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nsometimes it may be necessary to experience the results of some bad karmas =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;before some good things happen. Imagine all your karmas lying in a pile=\r\n in a &lt;BR&gt;basket. Suppose some of the really good karmas that will enable y=\r\nou to do &lt;BR&gt;serious sadhana and experience great things lie at the bottom =\r\nor middle of &lt;BR&gt;the pile. When you start sadhana, suppose god decides to g=\r\nive you the fruits &lt;BR&gt;of those auspicious karmas. Imagine him reaching int=\r\no the pile and &lt;BR&gt;retrieving those karmas. In the\n process, some other kar=\r\nmas may spill over &lt;BR&gt;and give their fruits. Some of those may be undesira=\r\nble. So what? They had &lt;BR&gt;to be experienced sometime or the other, anyway!=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A serious sadhaka should never be disheartened by a few seemingly &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;undesirable results after starting a spiritual sadhana. Just keep going.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One gentleman I know received mantra for Kaali from a very good &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;priest-cum-yogi in late 2005. After he did the mantra for a few days, he w=\r\nas &lt;BR&gt;laid off and lost his job. He was not perturbed. He continued his sa=\r\ndhana &lt;BR&gt;and used the break to go on an extended trip to India and make a =\r\npilgrimage &lt;BR&gt;to some nice places. He participated in the Shata Chandi hom=\r\nam we conducted &lt;BR&gt;at the Kaalikambal temple in Chennai in March 2006. He =\r\nmet my guru and got &lt;BR&gt;the opportunity to be his room mate for a week when=\r\n we stayed at the house &lt;BR&gt;of a priest during the homam. He could observe =\r\nand interact with my guru &lt;BR&gt;very closely.\n Most importantly, when my guru=\r\n had a vision of the Mother on &lt;BR&gt;2006 March 3 afternoon, in which She tol=\r\nd him to start the work on spreading &lt;BR&gt;homam in the world, this gentleman=\r\n was present there. Though he could not &lt;BR&gt;see the Mother, he actually sme=\r\nlled something out of the world and was &lt;BR&gt;baffled. He knew something was =\r\ngoing on, but did not know what. The temple &lt;BR&gt;was closed at the time and =\r\nmy guru and this gentlemen were the only people &lt;BR&gt;on the premises when th=\r\ne Mother appeared. Even though he could not see the &lt;BR&gt;Mother, it was most=\r\n fortunate of him to be present there at *that* crucial &lt;BR&gt;moment. That is=\r\n enough to mould the rest of his life.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You never know how, when and =\r\nwhere the grace of god falls on you. &lt;BR&gt;Calculations and logic are useless=\r\n when it comes to the grace of god. Just &lt;BR&gt;surrender and keep doing whate=\r\nver sadhana you picked. If it needs &lt;BR&gt;fine-tuning, somebody will appear t=\r\no tell you that. Any bad things that\n &lt;BR&gt;happen when doing a spiritual sad=\r\nhana should be viewed as nature settling &lt;BR&gt;some debts so that you are pre=\r\npared to receive the fruits of some really &lt;BR&gt;auspicious karmas.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As=\r\n Shirdi Sai Baba says, you should have &quot;sraddha and saburi&quot;. Have devotion =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;and patience.

I will&lt;BR&gt;&gt; continue in&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; the same vein for a little more time.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; I had a =\r\ndream a couple of years ago early in the morning. In the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; dream,&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; there was a big ritual fire. My guru Manish Pandit and I were&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; sitting in&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; front of the fire. He was teaching me some prana=\r\nyama techniques in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; dream. Suddenly, he changed into=\r\n somebody else that I could not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; recognize.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; It was not a=\r\nnybody I had seen\n before.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; I mentioned this dream t=\r\no my guru after a couple of weeks. First&lt;BR&gt;&gt; he said he&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; did=\r\n not know who the other person was and said he would&#39;ve&lt;BR&gt;&gt; probably kn=\r\nown if&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; I had mentioned the dream soon after it had happened. I =\r\nleft it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; there.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; However, when we talked in the next week=\r\nend, he referred to my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; dream and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; said he had an idea wh=\r\no it was. He gave me a name and asked me to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; search on&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; t=\r\nhe internet for his photo and see if he was the person I saw in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; my =\r\ndream.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; It was a guru from the lineage of Paramahamsa Yogananda =\r\n(before&lt;BR&gt;&gt; him). Though&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; he is apparently well-known, I was=\r\n not knowledegable about this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; lineage and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; did not see h=\r\nis picture before. I searched on the internet and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; found a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&g=\r\nt; photo. Interestingly, the photo was very close to the person I saw&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; in\n my&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; dream. The person that Manish transformed into in my =\r\ndream looked&lt;BR&gt;&gt; like a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; slightly younger version of that ph=\r\noto.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; When I confirmed this to Manish, he only smile=\r\nd and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; said, &quot;Narasimha, there&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; are so many links between=\r\n various lineages. Leave it for now.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, I =\r\ndo not know much about kriya yoga or about the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; lineage of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&g=\r\nt; Paramahamsa Yogananda. Our lineage of this life starts from&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Datt=\r\natreya. We&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; have a special attachment to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa=\r\n and his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; lineage and got&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; a lot of our knowledge, inspir=\r\nation and perhaps experience from&lt;BR&gt;&gt; them. We do&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; not have =\r\nany direct link to the lineage of Paramahamsa Yogananda.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; But,&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt;&gt; Manish thought there were some other indirect links. Moreover, he&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; guessed&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; who I saw, even though I myself had no idea who\n =\r\nI saw, and he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; guessed&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; correctly. That should count for =\r\nsomething!&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; I will not be surprised if there are ind=\r\need subtle connections&lt;BR&gt;&gt; between&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; several lineages that se=\r\nem disjoint today.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; By the way, Swami Vivekananda al=\r\nso appeared in the prison cell of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Aurobindo (who wr=\r\note brilliant commentaries on Veda and Upanishad)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; i=\r\nmparted him some Adwaita knowledge to Sri Aurobindo.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt=\r\n; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; An interesting coincidence is that a swamij=\r\ni from Puri contacted&lt;BR&gt;&gt; me within a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; few days after I saw =\r\nthat photo. His guru and Paramahamsa&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Yogananda were&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; co-=\r\ndisciples of the same guru (Yukteshwar Maharaj). He is the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; keeper o=\r\nf&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; some astrological knowledge that his guru received from Yukte=\r\nshwar&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Maharaj.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; He visited me after a month,\n discussed =\r\nthat knowledge and spent a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; day at my&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; house. Thus, some =\r\nsmall connection was made with a representative&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of that&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n lineage soon after the dream. After all, some karmik debts may&lt;BR&gt;&gt; hav=\r\ne been&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; there...&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt;&gt; I want to make one thing clear.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Some things =\r\nI mention like this may give the impression that my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; guru has&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n;&gt; some psychic abilities or siddhis. That may indeed be true. But he&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; always&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; downplays those things and attaches no importance =\r\nwhatsoever. He&lt;BR&gt;&gt; says,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Narasimha, I am a useless person =\r\nand lower than dirt and capable&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; nothing. It is all H=\r\ner power. She is the connection between every&lt;BR&gt;&gt; entity in&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n this universe. She may choose an idiot like me as an instrument&lt;BR&gt;&gt; so=\r\nmetimes&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; and do something using me. I have no\n special abilities=\r\n of any&lt;BR&gt;&gt; kind. Any&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; coincidences you find are just Her gr=\r\nace and not due to me.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; I realized in time that thi=\r\ns simplicity, humility and lack of ego&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is not&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; fake. I a=\r\nlso realized that this lack of ego is what enabled him to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; do things=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; that sound impossible or difficult. In fact, I realized that m=\r\nany&lt;BR&gt;&gt; great&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; saints in the past were like this. Several ma=\r\ngical things happened&lt;BR&gt;&gt; through&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; them, but they did not fi=\r\nnd any pride in them and retained their&lt;BR&gt;&gt; humility&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; and se=\r\nnse of surrender to their chosen form of god and believed&lt;BR&gt;&gt; that god&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;&gt; was the doer of all things and they were mere instruments.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; The day you also start believing that, not for the sake=\r\n of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; lecturing or&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; posturing, but from the deep cores of =\r\nyour heart, your sadhana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; will\n bear&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; fruit.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------ --=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Do a Short Ho=\r\nmam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_bl=\r\nank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; D=\r\no Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpan=\r\na&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;=\r\n/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedi=\r\nc-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/ve=\r\ndic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://v=\r\nedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicast=\r\nro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A h=\r\nref=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http=\r\n://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath\n Centre (SJC) web=\r\nsite: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofoll=\r\now&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; ----- Origin=\r\nal Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Dinesh Nambisan&quot; &lt;dinesh@...&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; To: &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n Sent: Monday, September 29, 2008 5:54 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdo=\r\nm] Yogananda (Re: Dharma)&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;=\r\nvedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.
