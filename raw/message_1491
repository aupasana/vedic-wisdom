I am working as a software manager at a \nsemi-conductor company making SoC (System-on-Chip) solutions for the \nblu-ray/DVD market. Several blu-ray/DVD players containing software written \nby me and my group are being sold at &quot;Best Buy&quot; now. We sometimes work 12-15 \nhours a day and weekends too. For example, I was at work this Sunday.\n\nHowever, it is difficult to compare one&#39;s life with another&#39;s, as each has \ndifferent circumstances. For example, I have a wife who shares my interests \nand co-operates. I have people around me who carry some positive spiritual \nvibrations. Someone else may have different situation.\n\nWhat I say is this: Do the best you can, based on your constraints, \ncircumstances and life goals.\n\nHowever, I see that most people DO have some time but tend to spend it on \nnot so useful activities. They spend time surfing internet, they spend time \nplaying internet games, they spend time on a lot of emails, they spend time \non TV, they spend time on activities like playing cards etc etc. If one \nreally looks, one can always find some time.\n\nOne person I know, another software engineer, was doing a Mahaganapathi \nhomam everyday. Then he switched to Chandi homam everyday. This made his \nlifestyle tight. Now he is doing one Chandi homam in the morning and another \nChandi homam in the evening, everyday. It is just a matter of prioritizing \nspiritual sadhana appropriately so that there is time for it. We can do \nthousands of things, but have time to do only a few things. We choose the \nfew things we do based on our sense of priority. Until spiritual sadhana \nbecomes a priority for you, not much can be done about it..\n\nThe thing with homam is that it is the most efficient method for those with \nlimited time. Even an half hour homam done everyday will make a lot of \ndifference over the long run.\n\nIf one has absolutely no time for homam, japam etc, one can atleast do \ninternal sadhana, i.e. redirect the thinking and attitude in various \nactivities done throughout the day.\n\nEspecially in big cities around the world where people are always running \nand filled with too much rajas and tamas do some serious sadhakas need to \ncome up and do serious sadhana like daily homam.\n\nWe waste a lot of emotional and intellectual energy dwelling on irrelevant \nthings. We bask &quot;He likes me..he praised me so much&quot;. We sulk &quot;he was unfair \nin criticizing me&quot;. And so on. Lingering emotions in our interactions with \nothers take up a lot of emotional and intellectual energy and we are left \nwith no energy for doing important things. Try to free your mind from \nlingering emotions, conserve the emotional energy and see if it makes a \ndifference.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;suvarnatejas&quot; &lt;suvarnatejas@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, March 09, 2009 12:06 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Balance of family responsibilities and Sadhana\n\n\n&gt; Dear Shri Narasimha:\n&gt;\n&gt; Can you shed some light on you personally balanced your\n&gt; family life and your spiritual endeavors?\n&gt; How do you manage your professional\n&gt; life (software engineering?), family responsibilities (children)\n&gt; etc as well as find time for homam/meditation etc.\n&gt; Are you still working full-time as an engineer?\n&gt; I hope this is not a very personal question.\n&gt;\n&gt; A regular hectic life in any modern city (Boston or Bangalore)\n&gt; seems to consume the physical energy of a person, and I find that\n&gt; there is about an hour&#39;s worth of time for any prayer. Of course\n&gt; we can continue to think about god and redirect our attitude\n&gt; through out the day, but there still is only a limited time\n&gt; for focused work like a homam or japam etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks and Regards.\n\n\n"}}
