I have felt similarly when rea=\r\nding some \nspiritual books, a couple of books that I always try to read I f=\r\nall \nsleepy and it is a good type of feeling.\n\nThe second type is due to in=\r\ncrease in tamasic qualities at the time \nof trying to concentrate and as re=\r\nsult one looses interest and does \nnot want to concentrate. This does not g=\r\nive good feeling, to overcome \nthis, one should try to avoid tamasic foods =\r\nfor an extended period of \ntime and eat more satvick food, along the satvic=\r\nk lines lead a life.\n\nChildren or all should sleep well before exam, there =\r\nis nothing wrong \nin that. why do you see that as a problem?\n\nHope this giv=\r\nes a different perspective ....\n\nBest Regards\nMitesh\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, &quot;msbohra62&quot; &lt;msbohra62@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Narsimhaji,\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Whenever i concentrate on any subject i am getting sleep ,it also \nseen=\r\n\n&gt; with my kids.When they preparing for exam for next day they getting\n&gt; sl=\r\neep very earlier than regular day,but watching a interesting film\n&gt; they di=\r\nd not got sleep even up to 2am.\n&gt; \n&gt; What are the reason?Lack of interest i=\r\nn the subject or some thing\n&gt; else?It is related to concentration power and=\r\n ability how to over \ncome\n&gt; from this sleepiness at the time of concentrat=\r\nion?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; M.S.Bohra\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nThe nature of mind is to wander and think various things. Mind \nwill\n&gt; stop=\r\n thinking only when it is in samadhi. Until then, it will \ncontinue\n&gt; to ge=\r\nt some good thoughts and some bad thoughts. That is its nature.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nhe goal of sadhana is to train the mind to focus on one thing. \nSome\n&gt; may =\r\ntrain the mind to focus on a mantra. Some may train the mind to\n&gt; focus on =\r\nmusical notes. Some may train the mind to focus on the\n&gt; breathing. In vari=\r\nous types of spiritual sadhana, you have one \nobject\n&gt; for the mind to focu=\r\ns on. Still, mind tries to wander off all the \ntime.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; If a compute=\r\nr is running a program and a virus or spyware or \nadware\n&gt; starts running, =\r\nan anti-virus program&#39;s watchdog task that is \nrunning\n&gt; in the same comput=\r\ner detects it and deletes it (before it does much\n&gt; harm). Similarly, insta=\r\nll a watchdog task in your mind. Suppose you\n&gt; are meditating or doing some=\r\n sadhana and trying to focus the mind on\n&gt; something. Suppose some other (g=\r\nood or bad!) thoughts come to the\n&gt; mind. As soon as you are aware of it (i=\r\n.e. the watchdog task detects\n&gt; them), simply delete the thoughts.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; I recommend not getting aggravated or frustrated at the bad\n&gt; thoughts. J=\r\nust become aware of them and tell yourself to focus on \nthe\n&gt; mantra. It is=\r\n *natural* for the mind to be thinking of those bad\n&gt; thoughts. By being ag=\r\ngravated or frustrated, you are only increasing\n&gt; the distraction. It is li=\r\nke picking fight with a heckler who\n&gt; interrupts a speech you are giving or=\r\n a song you are singing. Become\n&gt; aware and move on. If you pick a fight wi=\r\nth the heckler it does more\n&gt; harm than the original heckling!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; By=\r\n being aware of the distraction, acknowledging it and then\n&gt; consciously tr=\r\nying to ignore it, you are maximizing your chances of\n&gt; successfully return=\r\ning the full attention of the mind to the mantra.\n&gt; Of course, the distract=\r\nion will keep coming again and again. But the\n&gt; best option is to tell your=\r\n mind to focus on the mantra each time \nyou\n&gt; are aware of the distraction.=\r\n Do NOT get frustrated. As you keep \ndoing\n&gt; this over and over and over, t=\r\nhe heckler may decide to shut up.\n&gt; Similarly, as you ignore distractions o=\r\nf the mind, eventually \noneday a\n&gt; pleasant accident will happen and mind w=\r\nill achieve absolute focus \non\n&gt; the mantra, with no other thoughts! THAT i=\r\ns when you experience the\n&gt; mantra and deity. Until then, it is a rehearsal=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; All thoughts - good or bad - are distractions. When you are\n&gt; m=\r\neditating with a mantra, the mind should be focused on ONE thing.\n&gt; That on=\r\ne thing can be the sound of the mantra or an image of the \ndeity\n&gt; you have=\r\n in your mind or a thought that &quot;so and so deity is \nsupreme. I\n&gt; am an ins=\r\nignificant servant&quot; etc. Try to focus your mind on that one\n&gt; focus point. =\r\nAs other thoughts come, become aware and move on \nwithout\n&gt; any frustration=\r\n or sadness or anger or disappointment.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Original mail said: &quot;In m=\r\ny heart I definetly do not want them to\n&gt; materialize.&quot;.
