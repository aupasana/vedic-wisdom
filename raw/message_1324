This has become a habit for t=\r\nhe past \ncouple of months.\n\nI guess, if I do Homam on my own will get benef=\r\nited, hence this \nrequest.  Currently I&#39;m going through Sade Sathi period, =\r\nwant to do \nboth Ganapathi Homam and Sani Homam.\n\nI&#39;m worried to do Homam o=\r\nn my own as I may mis-spell the mantras, as \nI&#39;m not profecient with Hindi.=\r\n  I have observed some difference between \nHindi and English scripts, hence=\r\n requesting you to forward me the \nTelugu Homam Scripts if you have and if =\r\npossible.\n\nThanks in anticipation,\n\nCVRKumar.\n\n\n"}}
