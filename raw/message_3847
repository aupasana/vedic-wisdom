This explanation is explaining predominantly=\r\n from a male point of view\n2. According the modern doctors, whether or not =\r\nyou do intentionally or not, the Virya does not stay. It gets secreted any =\r\nway.\n3. Why so much focus or affinity for accumulation of energy? Yes, the =\r\ncommon argument is that we need to accumulate spiritual energy to burn our =\r\nkarma. But, why burn the karma? In several threads, the only absolute way o=\r\nf burning karma seem to be paying it up with out attachment. It is all in t=\r\nhe mind. In order to realise this and condition our mind, do we really need=\r\n energy. I trust, what we need is the resolve and persistant effort.\n4. Is =\r\nnot the goal is not to have a goal? We are advised not to anticipate/wish f=\r\nor an experiance while doing sadhana. Once we manage to do sadhana with out=\r\n any anticipation, why all this focus on accumulating energy or even obtain=\r\ning Moksha?\n\nIf the definition of Brahmacharya is to keep the mind in Brahm=\r\nan all the time, then our actions do not result in any more karma because, =\r\nyour mind is focusing on brahman and hence you do not identify yourself in =\r\nyour actions. You do them because you had to do them.\n\nPerhaps, best way to=\r\n get this is not avoiding certain actions but, try developing ability to ke=\r\nep thinking about God while doing any/every thing.\n\nThis reminds me a story=\r\n I read in my child hood.\n\nOnce Narada gets to proud that he is the best de=\r\nvotee as he keeps thinking of Narayana all the time. Vishnu disappoints him=\r\n by naming some wood cutter as his best devotee. This wood cutter utters th=\r\ne name of Vishnu only few times during the day. Narada protests and then Vi=\r\nshnu gives him a wessel full of milk and asks him to put it on his head and=\r\n walk around.\n\nIf can&#39;t stop sex, try to chant God&#39;s name while you are doi=\r\nng sex. If you can manage to decrease amount of joy you derise out of sex, =\r\nthen you are on the correct path. Nigraha will come automatically if you st=\r\nop enjoying it.\n\n\n"}}
