Say a person does 3 malas of a certain m=\r\nantra \nevery day. After the first round the person must turn back and so on=\r\n. \nI understand this. But does one have to remember on which side of the \nm=\r\nala he finished so he can start on that side of the mala on the next \nday? =\r\n\n\nIf yes, what is the best way of remembering? I myself attach a paper \ncli=\r\np on the side I finish with so I know to start on that side the \nvery next =\r\nday or for a different session on the same day. \n\nI hope I am being at leas=\r\nt somewhat clear.\n\nThank you.\n\n\n"}}
