Request you to kindly answer them for me. I have read books on Vedan=\r\nta and Advaita but the answer still eludes me or may be I am not able to co=\r\nmprehend the hidden meaning because of my limited knowledge.\n\n1) Karma as d=\r\nefined in wiki &quot;Karma (Sanskrit: &#2325;&#2352;&#2381;&#2350;  k=A8=A2rma (=\r\nhelp=A1=A4info), k=A8=A2rman- &quot;act, action, performance&quot;[1]; Pali: kamma) i=\r\nn Indian religions is the concept of &quot;action&quot; or &quot;deed&quot;, understood as that=\r\n which causes the entire cycle of cause and effect (i.e., the cycle called =\r\nsa&#7747;s=A8=A1ra)&quot;\n\nIf the soul is in the garb of an animal, lets say a D=\r\nog or a cat or any other non human entity , what karma can it do so that it=\r\n can progress to the next level. I mean We humans can understand what is go=\r\nod and what is bad, but animals lack the sixth sense (or atleast we think s=\r\no) fail to differentiate this and hence what is that they are supposed to d=\r\no so that they perform their karmas to the best to go forward?\n\n2) If my ac=\r\ntions are already governed by my past karmas then how do I justify the good=\r\n and bad that I do? I mean whatever good or bad that I do is already predef=\r\nined . In such a case how can I be held accountable for a good or a bad dee=\r\nd? Because its the karma that is driving me to do something. So this become=\r\ns a infinite loop. as Adi Shankara says in Bhaj Govindam , &quot;Punarapi janana=\r\nm , punarapi maranam&quot;... there seems to be no way out of this\n\nPlease forgi=\r\nve me for my ignorance but I felt I need to get this very elementary query =\r\nclarified .\n\nThanks and Regards,\nGirish Sundaram\n\n\n\n\n"}}
