The proud an=\r\nd the avaricious man are never\nat rest; while the poor and lowly of heart a=\r\nbide in the\nmultitude of peace.  The man who is not yet wholly dead to self=\r\n,\nis soon tempted, and is overcome in small and trifling matters.\nIt is har=\r\nd for him who is weak in spirit, and still in part\ncarnal and inclined to t=\r\nhe pleasures of sense, to withdraw\nhimself altogether from earthly desires.=\r\n  And therefore, when he\nwithdraweth himself from these, he is often sad, a=\r\nnd easily\nangered too if any oppose his will.\n\n2. But if, on the other hand=\r\n, he yield to his inclination,\nimmediately he is weighed down by the condem=\r\nnation of his\nconscience; for that he hath followed his own desire, and yet=\r\n in\nno way attained the peace which he hoped for.  For true peace of\nheart =\r\nis to be found in resisting passion, not in yielding to it.\nAnd therefore t=\r\nhere is no peace in the heart of a man who is\ncarnal, nor in him who is giv=\r\nen up to the things that are without\nhim, but only in him who is fervent to=\r\nwards God and living the\nlife of the Spirit.\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nOf fleeing from =\r\nvain hope and pride\n\nVain is the life of that man who putteth his trust in =\r\nmen or in\nany created Thing.  Be not ashamed to be the servant of others\nfo=\r\nr the love of Jesus Christ, and to be reckoned poor in this\nlife.  Rest not=\r\n upon thyself, but build thy hope in God.  Do what\nlieth in thy power, and =\r\nGod will help thy good intent. Trust not\nin thy learning, nor in the clever=\r\nness of any that lives, but\nrather trust in the favour of God, who resistet=\r\nh the proud and\ngiveth grace to the humble.\n\n2. Boast not thyself in thy ri=\r\nches if thou hast them, nor in thy\nfriends if they be powerful, but in God,=\r\n who giveth all things,\nand in addition to all things desireth to give even=\r\n Himself.  Be\nnot lifted up because of thy strength or beauty of body, for =\r\nwith\nonly a slight sickness it will fail and wither away.  Be not vain\nof t=\r\nhy skilfulness or ability, lest thou displease God, from\nwhom cometh every =\r\ngood gift which we have.\n\n3. Count not thyself better than others, lest per=\r\nchance thou\nappear worse in the sight of God, who knoweth what is in man.  =\r\nBe\nnot proud of thy good works, for God&#39;s judgments are of another\nsort tha=\r\nn the judgments of man, and what pleaseth man is ofttimes\ndispleasing to Hi=\r\nm.  If thou hast any good, believe that others\nhave more, and so thou mayes=\r\nt preserve thy humility. It is no\nharm to thee if thou place thyself below =\r\nall others; but it is\ngreat harm if thou place thyself above even one.  Pea=\r\nce is ever\nwith the humble man, but in the heart of the proud there is\nenvy=\r\n and continual wrath.\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nOf the danger of too much familiarity\n=\r\n\nOpen not thine heart to every man, but deal with one who is wise\nand feare=\r\nth God. Be seldom with the young and with strangers.  Be\nnot a flatterer of=\r\n the rich; nor willingly seek the society of\nthe great.  Let thy company be=\r\n the humble and the simple, the\ndevout and the gentle, and let thy discours=\r\ne be concerning things\nwhich edify.  Be not familiar with any woman, but co=\r\nmmend all good\nwomen alike unto God.  Choose for thy companions God and His=\r\n\nAngels only, and flee from the notice of men.\n\n2. We must love all men, bu=\r\nt not make close companions of all.\nIt sometimes falleth out that one who i=\r\ns unknown to us is highly\nregarded through good report of him, whose actual=\r\n person is\nnevertheless unpleasing to those who behold it.  We sometimes\nth=\r\nink to please others by our intimacy, and forthwith displease\nthem the more=\r\n by the faultiness of character which they perceive\nin us.\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nOf =\r\nobedience and subjection\n\nIt is verily a great thing to live in obedience, =\r\nto be under\nauthority, and not to be at our own disposal.  Far safer is it =\r\nto\nlive in subjection than in a place of authority.  Many are in\nobedience =\r\nfrom necessity rather than from love; these take it\namiss, and repine for s=\r\nmall cause.  Nor will they gain freedom of\nspirit, unless with all their he=\r\nart they submit themselves for\nthe love of God.  Though thou run hither and=\r\n thither, thou wilt\nnot find peace, save in humble subjection to the author=\r\nity of him\nwho is set over thee.  Fancies about places and change of them\nh=\r\nave deceived many.\n\n2. True it is that every man willingly followeth his ow=\r\nn bent,\nand is the more inclined to those who agree with him.  But if\nChris=\r\nt is amongst us, then it is necessary that we sometimes\nyield up our own op=\r\ninion for the sake of peace.  Who is so wise\nas to have perfect knowledge o=\r\nf all things?  Therefore trust not\ntoo much to thine own opinion, but be re=\r\nady also to hear the\nopinions of others.  Though thine own opinion be good,=\r\n yet if for\nthe love of God thou foregoest it, and followest that of anothe=\r\nr,\nthou shalt the more profit thereby.\n\n3. Ofttimes I have heard that it is=\r\n safer to hearken and to\nreceive counsel than to give it.  It may also come=\r\n to pass that\neach opinion may be good; but to refuse to hearken to others =\r\nwhen\nreason or occasion requireth it, is a mark of pride or\nwilfulness.\n\nCH=\r\nAPTER X\n\nOf the danger of superfluity of words\n\nAvoid as far as thou canst =\r\nthe tumult of men; for talk concerning\nworldly things, though it be innocen=\r\ntly undertaken, is a\nhindrance, so quickly are we led captive and defiled b=\r\ny vanity.\nMany a time I wish that I had held my peace, and had not gone\namo=\r\nngst men.  But why do we talk and gossip so continually,\nseeing that we so =\r\nrarely resume our silence without some hurt\ndone to our conscience?  We lik=\r\ne talking so much because we hope\nby our conversations to gain some mutual =\r\ncomfort, and because we\nseek to refresh our wearied spirits by variety of t=\r\nhoughts.  And\nwe very willingly talk and think of those things which we lov=\r\ne or\ndesire, or else of those which we most dislike.\n\n2. But alas! it is of=\r\nten to no purpose and in vain.  For this\noutward consolation is no small hi=\r\nndrance to the inner comfort\nwhich cometh from God.  Therefore must we watc=\r\nh and pray that\ntime pass not idly away.  If it be right and desirable for =\r\nthee\nto speak, speak things which are to edification.  Evil custom and\nnegl=\r\nect of our real profit tend much to make us heedless of\nwatching over our l=\r\nips.  Nevertheless, devout conversation on\nspiritual things helpeth not a l=\r\nittle to spiritual progress, most\nof all where those of kindred mind and sp=\r\nirit find their ground\nof fellowship in God.\n\n\n \n\n\n      \r\n--0-67909208-1264251230=:91883\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman,new york,times,serif;fon=\r\nt-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;swami vivekanada had the perfect memory as he was a perfe=\r\nct yogi&lt;br&gt;he read books only once and remembered it forever&lt;br&gt;i never hea=\r\nrd that he kept on carrying these two books&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font=\r\n-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; p=\r\nadding-left: 5px; font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-s=\r\nize: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Tahoma&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; chaudhuri.krishnendu &lt;krishnend=\r\nuchdhr@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b=\r\n&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sen=\r\nt:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Sat, January 23, 2010 5:59:33 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-we=\r\night:\n bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; [vedic-wisdom] Imitation of Christ - Part=\r\n 3&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=3D&quot;x-dns-prefetch-control&quot; content=3D&quot;off=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygr=\r\np-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;CHAPTER VI&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOf inordinate affection=\r\ns&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWhensoever a man desireth aught above measure, immediately he&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nbecometh restless.
