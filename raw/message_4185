Now generally, religious festivals etc. a=\r\nre not observed on adhika months but kept for suddha months.\n&gt; However, as =\r\nfar as I know, the significance of Akshaya Tritiyaa is that the Sun and Moo=\r\nn are both exalted on this day.\n&gt; Now, would the festival be observed today=\r\n because of the exaltation of the Sun and Moon or would it be observed next=\r\n month to keep it at the right time in the soli-lunar calendar, regardless =\r\nof the planetary positions?\n&gt; \n&gt; I have seen the latter in calendars but I =\r\nfeel there is something amiss.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kindly share your views.
