Perfect devotion to any one form of god is enough to ta=\r\nke care of all aspects \n&gt; &gt;&gt;of one&#39;s life. Though different forms work diff=\r\nerently in the short run (though \n&gt; &gt;&gt;they lead to the same thing in the lo=\r\nng run), choosing forms based on horoscope \n&gt; &gt;&gt;is not foolproof. I have st=\r\nudied various classics and modern works on astrology \n&gt; &gt;&gt;and know the subj=\r\nect as thoroughly as anybody on earth today. I can declare \n&gt; &gt;&gt;confidently=\r\n that astrology is not reliable for deciding the deities to worship.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Also, what decides the nature of one&#39;s worship is not just the n=\r\name used for the \n&gt; &gt;&gt;deity and the prayer used, but also the intention and=\r\n attitude. The vibrations \n&gt; &gt;&gt;created in the consciousness are a function =\r\nof which deity/prayer is used and \n&gt; &gt;&gt;with which intention/attitude.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;2. Suppose there is a dent on the side of my car that makes it a=\r\n little \n&gt; &gt;&gt;difficult to close the door. If I do not care about how good m=\r\ny car looks and \n&gt; &gt;&gt;the little difficulty in closing the door, I may not w=\r\nant to spend money and get \n&gt; &gt;&gt;it repaired. I can use that money for somet=\r\nhing better.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;For someone like Ramana Maharshi or Ramakrishna=\r\n Paramahamsa, body is just as \n&gt; &gt;&gt;external as a car. One who identifies ma=\r\ninly with the body will be so concerned \n&gt; &gt;&gt;with bodily problems, but not =\r\none whose identification with the body is bare \n&gt; &gt;&gt;minimum.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;3. As we pray, god gives what we seek. He also creates situations that mak=\r\ne us \n&gt; &gt;&gt;wonder if we are seeking the right things. We can improve in what=\r\n we seek. As we \n&gt; &gt;&gt;evolve, we may seek something better and god may event=\r\nually give it too.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Parents may give a small child a toy. The=\r\ny may give an older child a book to \n&gt; &gt;&gt;read. They may give an even older =\r\nchild some work to do.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;In fact, an adult son may work and br=\r\ning money to buy toys for the smaller \n&gt; &gt;&gt;children. Some saints take on su=\r\nffering so that some other people are spared of \n&gt; &gt;&gt;the suffering as they =\r\nembark on their spiritual journey.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Narasim=\r\nha\n&gt; &gt;&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-=\r\nwisdom\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWr=\r\nitings\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Twitter ID: @homa=\r\nm108\n&gt; &gt;&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;On Wed, May 18, 2011 at 10:19 PM, priyank_priyank wrote:\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Respected PVR, \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;I think you will be the best person to th=\r\nrow some light on following \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;1.
