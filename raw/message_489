At these places they do &lt;BR&gt;charitable &lt;BR&gt;&gt; activities.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ranchoddasji Maharaj had many disciples but he never made anybody &lt;BR&gt;his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; sucessor.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; A lot of books have been written by one or two lady disciples of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ranchoddasji Maharaj and all this information written here is &lt;BR&gt;coming &lt;BR&gt;&gt; from those books. these books are avialable in his ashrams. They &lt;BR&gt;are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; written in Gujarati and Hindi Dialect.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; These books describe Ranchoddasji Maharaj&#39;s teachings, his view on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; many things,\n his short speeches and kind of like biography.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; These are very good books, they describe many aspects of &lt;BR&gt;spirtuality &lt;BR&gt;&gt; in simple laymans language.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Babaji indicated that Lahiri Mahashaya was his disciple for 5 births&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and in this birth with kriya yoga he cleared all his impressions &lt;BR&gt;and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; was given authority to guide people and initiate in kriya yoga &lt;BR&gt;after &lt;BR&gt;&gt; relalizing his true nature. Like him he had another disciple in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Bengal too known as &quot;Din bandhu&quot; but I do not have any information &lt;BR&gt;on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Babaji did meet Shri Yuteshwar Maharaj a few times.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; He also indicated that many advanced saints from the Nath &lt;BR&gt;Sampradaya &lt;BR&gt;&gt; also took birth and followed the ramanandi sampradaya to experiance &lt;BR&gt;&gt; more bliss.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; My intent here is to share information and not start any &lt;BR&gt;&gt; controversies.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If\n anyone needs the names of these books and also the address of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ashrams, I am very happy to provide that too.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If there is interest in more information than I shall try to write &lt;BR&gt;&gt; more about the lineage and the prominent saints of the lineage too.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I also have many pictures of Ranchoddasji Maharaj, but am not sure &lt;BR&gt;&gt; how to load them up for you all to see.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Happy Navratri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mitesh&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\r\n--0-991660342-1223095164=:60367--\r\n\n"}}
