It is saying that Brahm=\r\nan is Complete and also this Creation is Complete. Though the Creation has =\r\ncome from Brahman, still both Brahman AND the manifested Creation are Compl=\r\nete by themselves! In other words, Creation exists within Brahman as a pote=\r\nntiality and Brahman exists within Creation as the Indestructible essence.\n=\r\n \nIf one really understands what the verse is saying, the discussion of &quot;co=\r\nmplete&quot; coconut and &quot;half&quot; coconut is a moot point. The same &quot;Complete&quot; Bra=\r\nhman exists within a giant planet and within an atom too. And, of course, w=\r\nithin a full coconut, half coconut and even a small coconut piece!\n \n*     =\r\n   *        *\n \nHowever, such an understanding is not natural to our minds =\r\nin their conditioned state. The rituals we perform and the sadhana we do ar=\r\ne aimed at removing the mental conditioning and make such an understanding =\r\nnatural to our minds. Thus, rituals employ tools that put some useful ideas=\r\n in our minds.\n \nWhatever you offer as poornaahuti in a homam, the key is t=\r\no imagine it as your head or ego and surrender to the deity completely. Imm=\r\nediately after the poornaahuti, go to meditation with as deep a sense of su=\r\nrrender as possible for you. THAT is the key. If putting a full coconut or =\r\nanother full fruit makes such a visualization easier AND if it is practical=\r\n in your situation, go for it. If not, offer whatever you can (half coconut=\r\n, a small coconut piece, a small banana, a date, a raisin or whatever) and =\r\ndo your best to maximize the sense of surrender.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; =\r\na full coconut (dry one off course) Purnaahuti\n \nUtpal, apart from a full d=\r\nry coconut, one can even offer a normal full coconut, i.e. one with a shell=\r\n and with water inside. While a full dry coconut is highly combustible and =\r\nsymbolic of the ego of an advanced yogi, a normal coconut is far more diffi=\r\ncult to burn and a better symbol of the ego of a normal person. If one has =\r\na big homa kundam and a big fire with enough wood, one can burn a regular f=\r\null coconut too. One can also offer other fruits such as bananas.\n \nHowever=\r\n, one has to do the best one can, in one&#39;s practical situation. If one is d=\r\noing in a closed room (e.g. apartment) with a small homa kundam and a small=\r\n fire, one has to choose materials that minimize the smoke.\n \n*        *   =\r\n     *\n \nRishis are compassionate. They never said so and so thing is unavo=\r\nidable. They knew that procedures are only symbols for internal changes. Pr=\r\nocedures are not absolute and what they symbolize are absolute. Same intern=\r\nal changes can be achieved with different procedures, based on desa, kaala =\r\nand paatra. So rishis always gave many options.\n \nInstead of not doing some=\r\nthing because you are missing one ingredient, it is better to do something =\r\nwith the available ingredients. If one does a homam and offers a half cocon=\r\nut or even a dry coconut piece as poornaahuti, it is perfectly fine. As I s=\r\naid before, work on the mental part of it for the best results.\n \nBest rega=\r\nrds,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo P=\r\nitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality=\r\n: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): ht=\r\ntp://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJag=\r\nannath.org\n----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--\n \n---- utpal pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste Balasubra=\r\nmanian ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for your straight forward response.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Simpl=\r\ny because half coconut burns faster than full coconut,&lt;&lt;&lt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I humbly wis=\r\nh to point out here that Half coconut is not substituted \n&gt; because it burn=\r\ns faster. it is substituted because the fire in a small Homa kundam can ove=\r\nrwhelm it and burning is complete most of the times. as the fire is relativ=\r\nely much smaller and weaker in tiny Homa kundam used by many of us in our r=\r\negular homas, a full coconut (dry one off course) Purnaahuti has all the ch=\r\nance of extinguishing it.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is my strong faith that in this yuga (or =\r\nmayone be in any yuga), Bhakti and Bhavana in rituals are much much more im=\r\nportant than following the instructions literally prescribed for rituals. T=\r\nhat is not to discount on the methods, materials and other things but we ca=\r\nn certainly compromise those if our Bhavana and bhakti is strong.\n&gt; \n&gt; To c=\r\nlarify further, I=C3=A2??ll provide some examples-\n&gt; \n&gt; * if one is run out=\r\n of Flowers and could not get it on some day, one can offer &#39;Akshataas&#39; to =\r\nthe deity by making Bhavana and requesting the deity to accept it as flower=\r\ns.\n&gt; \n&gt; * As Narasimha has mentioned so many times in his Homa manuals such=\r\n things.\n&gt;      - wear Pavitra (Ring) of Darbha, if not then wear any ring,=\r\n if that is not available then continue without it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, Purnaahut=\r\ni is symbolical of our ego as we all know. The coconut offered in any Homa =\r\nrepresents head of the Sadhaka. it in its essence means Ego, Intelligence, =\r\npride, attachments etc...,\n&gt; \n&gt; I wish to humbly ask a question to you here=\r\n. Due to serious constraint(s), if some one is not able to offer full cocon=\r\nut as Purnaahuti, then can he not offer Half coconut or even a piece of coc=\r\nonut making a &#39;Bhavana&#39; that it is his/her head which is offered and reques=\r\nt the deity in the fire to accept it? What will be wrong in that and how it=\r\n can be a big mistake even if that differs slightly at gross level from the=\r\n prescription of Shastras?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks again for your post.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regar=\r\nds,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, G Balasubramanian =\r\n&lt;gbsub@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Dear Friends,\n&gt; &gt; At the time of Poorna Ahuti, =\r\n a  full coconut(poorna phalam)  is required to be offered by chanting  the=\r\n  Vedic Mantra&quot; Poornamadah  Poornamidam  Poornaat  Poornamudatchyate   Poo=\r\nrnasya   Poornamaadaaya  Poornamevaasishyate&quot;.  Simply because half coconut=\r\n burns faster than full coconut, in my humble opinion we can not substtute =\r\na full coconut with a broken half of coconut in Poorna Ahuti. Already our p=\r\nurohits are using camphor for lighting Agni.  This is not the prescribed me=\r\nthod of generating fire for Homam( Havan).Some of them are also blowing fir=\r\ne with  a gush of wind from their mouth for  the purpose of creating flame =\r\n instead of  using hand fan or  by blowing through a cylindrcal pipe or blo=\r\nwing through Dharba grass. My appeal to learned people is let us not devite=\r\n from the procedures and dos and donts handed over to us by Rishis.\n&gt; &gt; G.B=\r\nalasubramanian\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ________________________________\n&gt; &gt; From: utpal pa=\r\nthak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Wedn=\r\nesday, August 5, 2009 3:43:12 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Purnaahuti of =\r\nCoconut Half - a quick suggetion !\n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Friends,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; wi=\r\nsh you all a happy Raksha Bandhan - Naliyeri (Coconut) Purnima ! and also t=\r\nhe Eclipse which round the orner.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; quickly wish to point out that i=\r\nf a Coconut half used as Purnaahuti (Final offering symbolic of ego) is pla=\r\nced like a CAP (white portion remains inside and not visible), it burns *ve=\r\nry* brilliantly and the burning is *COMPLETE*. i am doing this for a week a=\r\nnd observed that not only the purnaahuti ofering, it helps in complete burn=\r\ning of everything in the Havan Kunda.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; jst thought of sharing with =\r\nyou all.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal\n\n\n"}}
