I have =\r\nheard various\nversions of the Ganesha bija. According to my knowledge, the =\r\ntwo most\ncommon iterations are &quot;Gam&quot; and &quot;Gang&quot;. However, I was recently\nsp=\r\neaking with someone who is somewhat well versed in Sanskrit and he\ntold me =\r\nthat that the aforementioned two versions are both incorrect,\nat least from=\r\n a phonetic viewpoint. \n\nSo my question then: How should one pronounce the =\r\nGanesha bija while\ndoing Japa? I would really like to know the technically =\r\nprecise way,\nif at all possible to learn via this medium.\n\n\nMany Thanks.\n\n\n"}}
