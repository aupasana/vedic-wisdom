Remember His Name all the time. But t=\r\nhe mind never obeys (at least mine doesn&#39;t). It remembers only sporadically=\r\n unfortunately...it&#39;s such a meandering wandering thing!\n\n&quot;Life is short, T=\r\nime is fleeting&quot; says Sivananda. Something has to be done to curtail this w=\r\nandering mind. Enough time is already lost, and not an extra minute will be=\r\n given to us!\n\nI wanted PRACTICAL TIPS on how to remember God all the time,=\r\n and googled it to see if anyone had any bright ideas. \n\nThis article came =\r\nup. It&#39;s very interesting. \n\nhttp://www.speakingtree.in/spiritual-blogs/see=\r\nkers/meditation/how-to-remember-god-at-all-times\n\nThe author, Sadhak Gaurav=\r\n, says:\n\n&quot;While doing duties, one is supposed to remember God. There can be=\r\n three ways to achieve such remembrance:\n \n1) While remembering God, do the=\r\n work. (Here remembrance is foremost and work is secondary.)\n\n2) While doin=\r\ng work, remember God. (Here work is foremost and remembrance is secondary.)=\r\n\n\n3) Only do God&#39;s work. (Here exclusive feelings towards God are primary.)=\r\n\n\nMost of the people try to follow #1 and #2. Some people do minimal amount=\r\n of duties and make remembrance their prime focus.    \nSome other people tr=\r\ny to do their duties and take care of their family and friends and try to r=\r\nemember God while doing their duties. Most of these people struggle to reme=\r\nmber God and tend to forget him. One obvious reason is the lack of alertnes=\r\ns. But they also make very grave mistake. They accept their body, family, w=\r\nork and business as their own and have feeling on mine-ness towards it. \n\n&quot;=\r\nTherefore, God is forgotten again and again and it is difficult to remember=\r\n Him.&quot;\n\n&quot;If one does only God&#39;s work, then God will always be remembered. T=\r\nhere is sense of mine-ness towards God and His work and therefore, remembra=\r\nnce happens all the time. Therefore, one should have a firm resolve to do o=\r\nnly God&#39;s work so that one can always remember Him.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;What is God&#39;s work?=\r\n In order to do God&#39;s work, one must accept and understand the truth. The t=\r\nruth is that everything  belongs to God. All living entities are part of Go=\r\nd as God is in everyone. All activities done are God&#39;s work as God is every=\r\none.&quot;\n\nI thought he explained the technique brilliantly. God bless him! It&#39;=\r\ns easy to say &quot;remember God&quot;, but it&#39;s much more helpful when someone gives=\r\n PRACTICAL advice on how to! \n\nHow does one remember God all day? While bru=\r\nshing one&#39;s teeth? While driving? While at work? When someone&#39;s yelling at =\r\none? When someone&#39;s being nice to one?  \n\nSivananda said, No need to run aw=\r\nay to the forest if you&#39;re a busy man/woman of the world. You can attain Go=\r\nd in and through the world. Every hour, spend 2 minutes contemplating God. =\r\n\n&quot;Every hour, on the hour&quot; (like the BBC world news slogan!), contemplate G=\r\nod and say the Name...Over time, this builds up a huge spiritual force that=\r\n will transform you...\n\nHere&#39;s Sivananda&#39;s article on God rememberance for =\r\nworking people/householders... \n\nhttp://www.energyenhancement.org/sivananda=\r\n/Sri-Swami-Sivananda-The-Path-Beyond-Sorrow-Chapter-9-Yoga-In-The-Home-7-Dy=\r\nnamic-Spirituality-Remembering-God.html\n\nOm Namo Narayanaya\n\nAparna\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
