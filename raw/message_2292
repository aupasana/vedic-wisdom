Using  the above-mentioned quotation as a yardstick let us evaluate ourselves as where we stand.  All the quotations from Puranas and Dharma Sastras so far quoted go to assert the a Brahmana is not Brahmana solely by birth. One has to exhibit Brahminical qualities and perform duties of Brahmin, if he were to be considered as Brahmana. Let me quote two more dictums from manu Samhita:-\n&quot;A Brahmana who, being  an agnihotri, voluntarily negelects the  sacred fire, shall perform the Chandrayana vrata for one month;  for that offence is equal to the slaughter of a son(Manu Samhita 11.41)\n&quot;A Brahman who without studying the vedas who labours for other things--wealth, position,adoration and other  opulences, becomes a sudra along with his family members  (Manu Samhita2.168)\n\nIn the Vishnu-Dharma, it is stated that any twice-born Brahmana who does not perform Sandhya Vandanam properly and engages in other activities and vows, goes to hell for one billion years.\n\nThe indisputable qualities   of a Brahmana have been described by Lord Krishna in verse 42 of Chapter 18 of  Bhagawad Gita.\n&quot;Serenity(peacefulness), self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance( forgiveness), uprighteousness(honesty),wisdom in theory and practise, and faith in God--from  these flow the natural duties of Brahmanas&quot;\nThe Mahabhrata enunciates the twelve-fold qualifications of a Brahmana. &quot;A Brahmana must be perfectly religious. he must be truthful, and he must be able to control his senses. he must execute severe austerities, and he must be detached, humble and tolerant. He must not envy anyone, and he must be expert in performing sacrifices and giving whatever  he has in charity. He must be fixed in devotion and be an expert in the knowledge of the Vedas&quot; . Vana Parva Chapter 180 of Mahabharata says,&quot; A person who possesses truthfulness, charity, forgiveness, sobriety,gentleness, austerity and lack of haterd is called a Brahmana&quot;.  And in Srimad Bhagavatam, sage  Narada  states,&quot; The symptoms of a Brahman are control of the mind, control of the senses, austerity and penance, cleanliness, contentment, forgiveness, simplicity, knowledge, mercy, truthfulness and complete surrender to God.&quot;(7.11.21).\nWe can go on quotong from scriptures about  what is expected of a Brahmana.\nIt is time for each one of us to undertake a self-audit of our conduct as a Brahmana, beleifs,faith etc. etc. in scriptures  in the light of what has been stated so far  in this connection.\n(to be continued)\nG.Balasubramanian\n\n\n      \r\n--0-678993138-1250646673=:13205\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family:garamond,new york,times,serif;font-size:18pt;color:#000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Friends,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The Garuda Purana says,&quot; Out of thousands of Brahmanas, one is qualified to perform &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;yagnas(sacrifices)&lt;/span&gt;, and out of many thousands of such qualified brahmanas expert in sacrifices, one learned Brahmana may have passed beyond all Vedic knowledge&quot;.&nbsp; Using&nbsp; the above-mentioned quotation as a yardstick let us evaluate ourselves as where we stand.&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;  &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;All the quotations from Puranas and Dharma Sastras so far quoted go to assert the a Brahmana is not Brahmana solely by birth.
