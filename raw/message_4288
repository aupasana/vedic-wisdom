Verily, God is all. (All is One)\n\nBecause =\r\nthe sage has already renounced for the sake of humanity his mind and\nbody, =\r\nhe feels no concern under the strain of service of his mind and body\nto the=\r\n world. He will not shun the bodily labour and will not be a friend of\nany =\r\nsuffering. It is the realization of the Peace that gives him such\ncourage a=\r\nnd presence of mind. (All in One)\n\nSince the (vital) fire called Kundalini =\r\nflames upwards, and the moon, namely\nintellect, flows downwards, the Suprem=\r\ne Self, the Sun Consciousness, who is\nthe (one) Source of bothm dwells betw=\r\neen them in the Heart.

(88)\n\nBliss is not something to be got.=\r\n You have only to get rid of your ignorance\nwhich makes you think that you =\r\nare other than bliss. For whom is this\nignorance? For the ego. Trace the so=\r\nurce of the ego. Then the ego is\ndestroyed and bliss remains ever. It is et=\r\nernal. (Talk, 106)\n\nLiberation is not to be achieved through endless cycled=\r\n of time by reading\nthe scriptures or worshipping the gods or by anything e=\r\nlse than knowledge of\nthe unity of Brahman and atman.

There is no\ndoubt of any kind in this natural state of b=\r\neing consciousness.\n\nNirvana is perfection. In the perfect state there is n=\r\neither subject nor\nobject, =E2=80=98there is nothing to see, nothing to fee=\r\nl, nothing to know. Seeing\nand knowing are the functions of the mind.

Similarly, can the unawareness by ignorant\npersons of the Self, which =\r\nis always of the nature awareness, be other than\ntheir own fault. (Collecte=\r\nd Works of Sri Ramana Maharshi)\n\nHear will be removed by the cool moon, pov=\r\nerty by the celestial\nwish-fulfilling tree, and sin by taking holy dip in t=\r\nhe ganga. But know that\nall these beginning with heat, will be removed mere=\r\nly by having the darshan\nof incomparable sadhus. (Ulladu Narpadu =E2=80=93 =\r\nSupplement, 4)\n\nTo know the Self is to be Self as the Self (I) is not two. =\r\nThis is (to be\nthe Self) indeed Self-abidance. (Upadesa Undhiar, 26)\n\nPower=\r\n over all and adorability by all came to God, because He never says\n=E2=80=\r\n=98I=E2=80=99, even through forgetfulness. (Guru Ramana Vachana Mala, 98)\n\n=\r\nSince God is verily the Self in the heart, constant meditation on the Truth=\r\n\nof oneself is the devotion that is most pleasing to God. (107)\n\nMan is gui=\r\nlty of theft, in thinking himself to be being separate from that\nPure indiv=\r\nisible Consciousness, which is the true nature of the Supreme one.\n(110)\n\nS=\r\nince the Supreme One Himself shines in the heart of every living being as\n=\r\n=E2=80=98I-I=E2=80=99, (it needs to be understood that) thus God teaches al=\r\nl, saying =E2=80=9CI am\nthe one (Self) in all=E2=80=9D. (=E2=80=98I-I=E2=80=\r\n=99 is the description of the Real Self, becaue\nHis manifestation as the Se=\r\nlf is constant while the ego is not so). (95)\n\nGod=E2=80=99s creation surel=\r\ny leads (man), through devotion to the Guru, to the\nstate of Self-Realisati=\r\non; thus it becomes a means of liberation from\nbondage, and should therefor=\r\ne be considered as benign. (102)\n\nGod=E2=80=99s grace consists in the act t=\r\nhat He shines in the heart of everyone as\nthe Self; that power of grace doe=\r\ns not exclude anyone, whether good or\notherwise. (103)\n\nFor those great one=\r\ns that see in their hearts the lotus-feet of God, arises\nthe Light of Consc=\r\niousness of the One Real Self, through the extinction of\ntheir mental taint=\r\ns. (106)\n\nThe (Supreme) Self is described as being smaller than the tiny at=\r\nom of\ngreater than the greatest, because He is beyond the reach of the mind=\r\n, which\nis itself infinite and atomic. (99)\n\nUnderstand that the truth of t=\r\nhe Vermilion powder (Kumkumam, used by some\ndevotees), is the fire of Illum=\r\nination, by which the delusion =E2=80=98I am the\nbody=E2=80=99 is burnt out=\r\n in the Heart, as the effect of the quest of the Self.\n(122)\n\nLike the offe=\r\nring of a bit of jaggery, taken off from Lord Ganesa made of\njaggery, is th=\r\ne offering of one=E2=80=99s own self to God. Is there any entity\ncalled the=\r\n self, apart from Him? (111)\n\nHe that sees the Lord in the temple, the livi=\r\nng body, by seeking Him within,\ncan alone see Him, the Infinite, in the tem=\r\nple of the universe, having\nbecome the endless Eye. He that has practiced d=\r\nevotion to God like that of\nmonkey, through many lives, attains supreme Ill=\r\numination by the grace of\nGod, through devotion like that of kitten. (114)\n=\r\n\nIgnorant ones look upon love as the seventh taste; (the truth is that) it =\r\nis\nthe first and foremost of all tastes, which gives flavour to all the\n(so=\r\n-called) other tastes. (119)\n\nEven if one who has shaken off all fruits and=\r\n won the divine endowment, has\ngone forth from the house (as a homeless asc=\r\netic) and practiced discipline\n(tapas), he will not win (complete) happines=\r\ns, without the company of a\n(competent) Guru. (126)\n\nThe man who has the no=\r\ntion =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99 cannot possibly worship God as\nformles=\r\ns; whatever worship he makes will be worship in form alone, not\notherwise. =\r\n(115)\n\nThe grace of the Guru is like an ocean. If you come with a cup, you =\r\nwill\nonly receive a cupful.It is no use complaining of the niggardliness of=\r\n the\nocean; the bigger the vessel, the more you will be able to carry.It is=\r\n\nentirely upto you.\n\nDays, planets, astrological =E2=80=98yogas;, time-peri=\r\nods, and constellations, are\nall auspicious for practicing devotion to the =\r\nMost Auspicious, for those\nthat have (sincere) devotion (to Him). (118)\n\nPe=\r\nrfect devotion is just the persistence of identity with the One\nall-embraci=\r\nng Reality, which shines forth when the false =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 is destro=\r\nyed\nutterly in the Heart, by the process of seeking the Self. (123)\n\nThe se=\r\neker of illumination should approach (as a disciple), not the bound\none who=\r\n (merely) knows the sense of the sacred love, (but) the Jivanmukta,\nthe one=\r\n that is in the Supreme Silence, who is happy in unity with the\nReality. (1=\r\n24)\n\nWhatever one does in the world is worship of God, if he has the convic=\r\ntion\nthat difference does not really exist, since all forms are only\nmanife=\r\nstation of God.(117)\n\n(But) he that is unqualified for the formless obtains=\r\n by the grace of God in\nthe end the Illumination of the Real Self, by worsh=\r\nipping Him with form.\n(116)\n\nHe that has (himself) crossed the ocean of rel=\r\nativity can (alone) help other\nmen to cross (the same); an unenlightened pe=\r\nrson elected (as Guru) by\nanother unenlightened one is like a blind guide t=\r\no another blind one. (125)\n\nThe One (Real Self) becomes threefold; to the d=\r\nevotee He is God; to the\nseeker of illumination He becomes the Guru; when t=\r\nhe mind still in the heart\nHe Himself becomes (manifest as) the Real Self. =\r\n(120)\n\nOffering of the self to that which is the reality of God in the Hear=\r\nt,\nthrough the extinction of the ego, is the final outcome of sustained\ndev=\r\notion to Him. (113)\n\nThe act of making the ego serve as the food of God, by=\r\n stilling the mind in\nthe Heart, by the power of devotion to God in his rea=\r\nl nature (as the Self),\nis real offering to Him. (112)\n\nThat auspicious and=\r\n immortal Reality which remains over as the residue, when\nthe individual (f=\r\nalse) self is cremated in the fire of Illumination, is the\nreal meaning of =\r\nthe =E2=80=98holy ash=E2=80=99, (vibhuti). (121)\n\nIt is said that Hari give=\r\ns Liberation, and that Hara gives Illumination; but\nIllumination is the tru=\r\ne nature of Liberation; hence Hari and Hara are one\nand the same. (100)\n\nTh=\r\nose who serve God (Siva) for the sake of objects desired do not (really)\nse=\r\nrve God; they serve the desired objects; hence they do not win the (true)\nr=\r\neward of devotion. (105)\n\nThat God prompted Kannapa, the great devotee, to =\r\noffer (to Himself) his own\neyes, was in order to confer on him His own stat=\r\ne through the extinction of\nhis ego.

(Ulladu Narpadu =E2=80=93 Supplement, 4)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\nTo know the Self is to be Self as the Self (I) is not two. This is (to be t=\r\nhe Self) indeed Self-abidance. (Upadesa Undhiar, 26)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Power over all =\r\nand adorability by all came to God, because He never says =E2=80=98I=E2=80=\r\n=99, even through forgetfulness. (Guru Ramana Vachana Mala, 98)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Si=\r\nnce God is verily the Self in the heart, constant meditation on the Truth o=\r\nf oneself is the devotion that is most pleasing to God. (107)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Man is=\r\n guilty of theft, in thinking himself to be being separate from that Pure i=\r\nndivisible Consciousness, which is the true nature of the Supreme one. (110=\r\n)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Since the Supreme One Himself shines in the heart of every livin=\r\ng being as =E2=80=98I-I=E2=80=99, (it needs to be understood that) thus God=\r\n teaches all, saying =E2=80=9CI am the one (Self) in all=E2=80=9D. (=E2=80=\r\n=98I-I=E2=80=99 is the description of the Real Self, becaue His manifestati=\r\non as the Self is constant while the ego is not so). (95)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;God=E2=\r\n=80=99s creation surely leads (man), through devotion to the Guru, to the s=\r\ntate of Self-Realisation; thus it becomes a means of liberation from bondag=\r\ne, and should therefore be considered as benign. (102)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;God=E2=80=99s=\r\n grace consists in the act that He shines in the heart of everyone as the S=\r\nelf; that power of grace does not exclude anyone, whether good or otherwise=\r\n. (103)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;For those great ones that see in their hearts the lotus-fe=\r\net of God, arises the Light of Consciousness of the One Real Self, through =\r\nthe extinction of their mental taints. (106)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The (Supreme) Self is d=\r\nescribed as being smaller than the tiny atom of greater than the greatest, =\r\nbecause He is beyond the reach of the mind, which is itself infinite and at=\r\nomic. (99)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Understand that the truth of the Vermilion powder (Kumk=\r\numam, used by some devotees), is the fire of Illumination, by which the del=\r\nusion =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99 is burnt out in the Heart, as the eff=\r\nect of the quest of the Self. (122)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bol=\r\nd&quot;&gt;Like the offering of a bit of jaggery, taken off from Lord Ganesa made o=\r\nf jaggery, is the offering of one=E2=80=99s own self to God. Is there any e=\r\nntity called the self, apart from Him? (111)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;He that sees t=\r\nhe Lord in the temple, the living body, by seeking Him within, can alone se=\r\ne Him, the Infinite, in the temple of the universe, having become the endle=\r\nss Eye. He that has practiced devotion to God like that of monkey, through =\r\nmany lives, attains supreme Illumination by the grace of God, through devot=\r\nion like that of kitten. (114)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Ignorant ones look upon love as the=\r\n seventh taste; (the truth is that) it is the first and foremost of all tas=\r\ntes, which gives flavour to all the (so-called) other tastes. (119)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\nEven if one who has shaken off all fruits and won the divine endowment, has=\r\n gone forth from the house (as a homeless ascetic) and practiced discipline=\r\n (tapas), he will not win (complete) happiness, without the company of a (c=\r\nompetent) Guru. (126)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The man who has the notion =E2=80=98I am the=\r\n body=E2=80=99 cannot possibly worship God as formless; whatever worship he=\r\n makes will be worship in form alone, not otherwise. (115)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The grace of the Guru is like an ocean. If you come=\r\n with a cup, you will only receive a cupful.It is no use complaining of the=\r\n niggardliness of the ocean; the bigger the vessel, the more you will be ab=\r\nle to carry.It is entirely upto you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Days, planets, astrolo=\r\ngical =E2=80=98yogas;, time-periods, and constellations, are all auspicious=\r\n for practicing devotion to the Most Auspicious, for those that have (since=\r\nre) devotion (to Him). (118)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perfect devotion is just the persistenc=\r\ne of identity with the One all-embracing Reality, which shines forth when t=\r\nhe false =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 is destroyed utterly in the Heart, by the proc=\r\ness of seeking the Self. (123)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The seeker of illumination should a=\r\npproach (as a disciple), not the bound one who (merely) knows the sense of =\r\nthe sacred love, (but) the Jivanmukta, the one that is in the Supreme Silen=\r\nce, who is happy in unity with the Reality. (124)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Whatever one doe=\r\ns in the world is worship of God, if he has the conviction that difference =\r\ndoes not really exist, since all forms are only manifestation of God.(117)&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;(But) he that is unqualified for the formless obtains by the grace o=\r\nf God in the end the Illumination of the Real Self, by worshipping Him with=\r\n form. (116)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;He that has (himself=\r\n) crossed the ocean of relativity can (alone) help other men to cross (the =\r\nsame); an unenlightened person elected (as Guru) by another unenlightened o=\r\nne is like a blind guide to another blind one. (125)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The On=\r\ne (Real Self) becomes threefold; to the devotee He is God; to the seeker of=\r\n illumination He becomes the Guru; when the mind still in the heart He Hims=\r\nelf becomes (manifest as) the Real Self. (120)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-w=\r\neight:bold&quot;&gt;Offering of the self to that which is the reality of God in the=\r\n Heart, through the extinction of the ego, is the final outcome of sustaine=\r\nd devotion to Him. (113)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The act of making the ego serve as=\r\n the food of God, by stilling the mind in the Heart, by the power of devoti=\r\non to God in his real nature (as the Self), is real offering to Him. (112)&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;That auspicious and immortal Reality which remains over as the resid=\r\nue, when the individual (false) self is cremated in the fire of Illuminatio=\r\nn, is the real meaning of the =E2=80=98holy ash=E2=80=99, (vibhuti). (121)&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It is said that Hari gives Liberation, and that Hara gives Illumin=\r\nation; but Illumination is the true nature of Liberation; hence Hari and Ha=\r\nra are one and the same. (100)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Thos=\r\ne who serve God (Siva) for the sake of objects desired do not (really) serv=\r\ne God; they serve the desired objects; hence they do not win the (true) rew=\r\nard of devotion. (105)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;That God prompted Kannapa, the great=\r\n devotee, to offer (to Himself) his own eyes, was in order to confer on him=\r\n His own state through the extinction of his ego.
