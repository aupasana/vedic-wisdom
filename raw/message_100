That was not my intention.\n\nI was only trying to say that seemingly different views in various Hindu \ntraditions are not contradictory, but it is possible to synthesize all into \none coherent understanding, based on the teachings of maharshis.\n\nOne insect may sit on the trunk of an elephant and describe the elephant as \nit sees. Another insect may sit on the back of the same elephant and \ndescribe what it sees. Yet another insect may sit at the end of the tail of \nthe same elephant and describe what it sees. And so on. Each insect may \nthink that it is describing the elephant accurately.\n\nOne can view the descriptions as being totally different and just select \nwhat one likes. Or one can synthesize them all into one understanding.\n\nIn any case, I see your subtly made point about discussing Vedanta on a \nShaiva list. So I will respectfully withdraw. However, before I withdraw, I \nwant to point out that some views I have mentioned were explicitly taught by \nLord Shiva Himself to Maharshi Vasishtha.\n\nMy apologies if I ruffled any feathers with the Vedantic discussions in the \nlast few days.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nHomam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;mahahradanatha&quot; &lt;mahahradanatha@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;sivacharya@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, July 13, 2007 1:35 PM\nSubject: [sivacharya] On Shakti and Brahman (Re: On Adwaitism...)\n\n\nI donï¿½t belive it is neccessary to discuss whether one darshana is\nsuperior and another one inferior it is sufficent for us to note that\nthere are indeed great differences of opinion and practical approach\nbetween the darshanas.\n\nBecause our discussion is happening in a mailing list called\nsivacharya i thought it is appropriate to remark that vedanta\ndarshana is not the same as shaiva darshanas regarding their\nviewpoint on maya and shakti and less appropriate to praise the\nsuperiority of vedanta over agam.\n\nFor a scholarly exposition on the differences please consult this\nwebpage:\n\nhttp://www.koausa.org/Glimpses/Maya.html\n\n\n\n\n--- In sivacharya@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

I am guessing your name from the email ID. If I am addressing\nyou\n&gt; incorrectly, I am sorry.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Many thanks for both replies which give a slightly\n&gt; &gt;&gt; differing perspective.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It is not a slight but a a huge difference whether you consider\nshakti\n&gt; &gt; as providing liberation from the fetters (as in the agamas) or as\n&gt; &gt; being the cause and embodiment of ahamkara, i.e. avidya and\ndelusion.\n&gt; &gt; (as in vedanta) To be exact it is an 100% percent opposite view.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Shakti that binds one also liberates one. She is the one who\nputs a veil\n&gt; and she is the one who removes it. Thus, the vedantic view is\nnot &quot;100%\n&gt; opposite&quot;, but it actually encompasses the view you mention and\ncaptures\n&gt; additional aspects of Shakti ignored in the view you mention.\n&gt;\n&gt; Though She is referred to as &quot;vidya avidya swarupini&quot; (embodiment\nof all\n&gt; knowledge and ignorance), one may be comfortable worshipping\ncertain aspects\n&gt; of Her and ignore others. Agamas are selective and offer a limited\npicture\n&gt; for practical utility, while vedanta is comprehensive and offers\nthe big\n&gt; picture.\n&gt;\n&gt; I maintain that what you referred to as &quot;vedanta viewpoint&quot;, i.e.\nthe\n&gt; teachings of maharshis, is actually the big picture that covers the\nessence\n&gt; of everything. Because it is very complex to understand and\nappreciate, some\n&gt; great teachers have taken limited aspects of the big picture and\nelaborated\n&gt; them so that more people can understand and appreciate it and make\nprogress.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thus, I suggest that seemingly different viewpoints of different\nreligious\n&gt; traditions originated from the same teachings of maharshis.\n&gt;\n&gt; Instead of approaching these view points with a &quot;this OR that&quot;\nattitude, I\n&gt; suggest approaching them with a &quot;this AND that&quot; attitude. The\nteachings of\n&gt; maharshis are the key in synthesizing everything.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you are convinced that the teachings of vedanta and the\nteachings of\n&gt; aagamas are totally different and that there is no commonality,\nthen we can\n&gt; respectfully agree to disagree.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Homam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message 2 ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;mahahradanatha&quot; &lt;mahahradanatha@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;sivacharya@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, July 12, 2007 12:25 PM\n&gt; Subject: [sivacharya] On Shakti and Brahman (Re: On Adwaitism...)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In sivacharya@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shrivajra&quot; &lt;shrivajra@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Namaste Narasimha and Mahahradanatha,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Many thanks for both replies which give a slightly\n&gt; &gt;&gt; differing perspective.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It is not a slight but a a huge difference whether you consider\nshakti\n&gt; &gt; as providing liberation from the fetters (as in the agamas) or as\n&gt; &gt; being the cause and embodiment of ahamkara, i.e. avidya and\ndelusion.\n&gt; &gt; (as in vedanta) To be exact it is an 100% percent opposite view.\n&gt; &gt; But too realise this is maybe also only possible when the\nAhamkara is\n&gt; &gt; absent and  the blessing of anugraha shakti and shiva present in\nthe\n&gt; &gt; jiva.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You can get futther insight into the basics of shaiva darshana\nhere:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://www.bhagavadgitausa.com/primer_in_saiva_siddhanta.htm\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message 1 ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;mahahradanatha&quot; &lt;mahahradanatha@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;sivacharya@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, July 12, 2007 6:04 AM\n&gt; Subject: [sivacharya] On Shakti and Brahman (Re: On Adwaitism...)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;I think it is necessary to remark that this exposition of yours is\n&gt; &gt; based on the vedanta philosophy and only about 10% of all shaivas\nare\n&gt; &gt; vedantins, the overwhelming majority has been and is following the\n&gt; &gt; authority of the agama which differs considerably from the vedanta\n&gt; &gt; viewpoint.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the agamas shakti is carrying out  fivefold activity of shiva\nand\n&gt; &gt; as the actor cannot be discerned from the act shakti is therefore\nnon\n&gt; &gt; differnt from shiva.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The cause of maya (delusion) is avidya, (lack of knowledge) the\ncause\n&gt; &gt; of avidya is ahamkara (ego).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the Agama Shakti is not the cause of maya or duality nor is\nshiva\n&gt; &gt; it is a natural law that gives rise to ahamkara and avidya,\n&gt; &gt; attachment aversion etc.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If out of his fivefold activity he  decides to veil his nature,\n&gt; &gt; shakti appears as if she is deluding, if shiva decides to unveil\nhis\n&gt; &gt; nature this act  appears in a form of shakti bestowing  his grace\n&gt; &gt; and  knowledge.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; These rhytmic acts of unveiling and veiling his nature are a\nnatural\n&gt; &gt; phenomena like our heartbeat or breath, symbolised by the sound of\n&gt; &gt; his damaru.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That is why one needs only to return to ones own nature,and be\n&gt; &gt; content, one cannot add or subtract anything from what is and all\n&gt; &gt; that exists verily is only shiva.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Following a natural cause delusion apears in the mind and will\nfall\n&gt; &gt; of the mind on its own accord by  that shakti (act) of grace of\n&gt; &gt; shiva, (the actor and the act being one as said before)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Qualification to realise the union of Shiva Shakti  in  this way\n(of\n&gt; &gt; the agama) is not reached by ones own effort it will appear by the\n&gt; &gt; act of the shakti alone in the field of consciousness no human\neffort\n&gt; &gt; (of the ahamkara) whatsoever can generate it on the contrary.\n\n\n"}}
