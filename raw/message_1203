I had =\r\nthe \ngood fortune of observing him and his writings for over a decade now \n=\r\nand I have seen no other person who is as crystal clear in his \nwritings an=\r\nd who is as mindful of his responsibilities and who is as \netiquette as Nar=\r\nasimha is. He almost never answers unless he feels \nthat what he is going t=\r\no write is useful not only to the person who \nhas asked the query but to ma=\r\nny more. All his posts are very \nthorough, informative and I for one believ=\r\ne that not only the people \nin this group but also others who will have the=\r\n good fortune of \nseeing his posting in the future will benefit immensely f=\r\nrom these \npostings on the net. When I look at the development and \ntransfo=\r\nrmation that he has gone through in this period, it amazes me \nto no end. I=\r\nnitially he was (of course still is) a scholar of Vedic \nastrology and late=\r\nr is developing in to a spiritual giant. In all \nthese years, he has unself=\r\nishly contributed to whatever he takes up \nand made it a point to spread th=\r\ne knowledge all around for the \nbenefit of the humanity in general. \n\nI kno=\r\nw Narasimha will not appreciate this mail as it contains no \nvaluable infor=\r\nmation for the seekers and it might sound as though I \nam praising him. My =\r\nintention is not that, for I believe he has risen \nabove accolade. \n\nYou ca=\r\nn certainly make requests or even oppose/question his writings \nand can ext=\r\nend other opinions that you may have, in a way that will \nnot offend the me=\r\nmbers of the group. Particularly the paragraph &quot;We \neat=85&quot; is not at all i=\r\nn good taste, although Utpal has taken them as \nhilarious comments, which s=\r\nhows his magnanimity. It clearly shows \nyour lack of understanding of the c=\r\nontext and level of Narasimha&#39;s \nspiritual attainments.\n\nI have never writt=\r\nen in support of anyone so far nor do I have the \nhabit of participating in=\r\n the discussions on the various groups. I \nhave been a silent member, as ma=\r\nny are, reading the wonderful \nwritings of people like Narasimha and trying=\r\n to learn from them.\n\nI hope I have not offended you with my comments, I ju=\r\nst felt like \nbutting in! I know Narasimha does not need support of anyone,=\r\n much \nless from me:-)\n\nRegards,\nRJ\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;=\r\nm540i98&quot; &lt;m540i98@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not blaming hi=\r\nm.

Spirit of attachment an=\r\nd desire controls how you \nabsorb \n&gt; &gt; your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experiences, when you a=\r\nre offering in that tongue of fire.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Manojava is the swift=\r\nly moving, flickering and unstable \nflame.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirit of wavering (coul=\r\nd also be flexibility) controls how \nyou\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; absorb your experiences, w=\r\nhen you are offering in that tongue \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; fire.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Sulo=\r\nhita is the (copper like) dark red color flame.

That in \n&gt; turn\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decides which tongues (tas=\r\nting agents) of your internal fire \nare\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; receiving food right now.
