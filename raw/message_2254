It has to start with Om\n2. In addition it can have a &#39;bi=\r\njakshar&#39; such as G^n. \n\nHence the mantra is \n1. &quot;Om G^n Ganapataye Nama:&quot;\n2=\r\n. &quot;Om Nama: Shivaay&quot; (Bijakshar is not needed. In Sanskrit verb can come an=\r\nywhere.)\n3. &quot;Om Vishnave Nama:&quot;\n4. &quot;Om Devyei Nama:&quot; Or &quot;Om Namo Devyei Mah=\r\nadevyei Shivayei Satatam Nama:&quot;\n\nThe importance of Mantra is in Sadhana. Ev=\r\nery Mantra needs to be made Siddha. There are methods for doing this. The e=\r\nxamples are well known. Story says that, Devarshi Narad gave mantra to Valy=\r\na Koli - &quot;Mara&quot; and asked him to repeat it continuously. You know the rest =\r\nof the story.\n\nThe simple method to make a mantra siddha is to repeat it da=\r\nily for a committed number of times with full dedication to the meaning of =\r\neach syllable of the mantra. The effect is seen gradually but definitely.\n\n=\r\nI am sorry, I always found it difficult to set the pronounciations right fo=\r\nr a non Indian language speaking person. Sometimes even it is difficult to =\r\nexplain it to an Indian language speaking person. For example - In &quot;Shivaay=\r\n Nama:&quot; and &quot;Nama: Shivaay&quot;, there is a subtle difference in the pronouncia=\r\ntion of &quot;Nama:&quot;. In the first one &quot;ha&quot; of the visarga &quot;:&quot; is to be pronounc=\r\ned completely while in the second one it is to be pronounced like a swar &quot;:=\r\n&quot; (no &quot;ha&quot;). Now you can understand why I say that it is difficult to expla=\r\nin.\n\nregards,\n\nJagmohan\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;gigarm2003&quot; =\r\n&lt;gigarm2003@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; From your answers seams that &quot;yei&quot; or &quot;ye&quot; has =\r\nnot to do with kundalini shakti...\n&gt; \n&gt; Please tell me if it&#39;s right or not=\r\n..\n&gt; One more thing.\n&gt; Could you please suggest me a sure reference, access=\r\nible for someone who speaks only english (don&#39;t understand sanskrit..)  to =\r\nlearn more about this Sacred knowledge of Mantras (books or maybe a teacher=\r\n to get in touch), according to the vedic tradition.\n&gt; In the West certain =\r\nknowledge is given from people claiming they have been the pupil of a certa=\r\nin guru or they studied in India for several years and so on.
