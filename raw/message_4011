I was also\n&gt; finalizing my new =\r\nbook which deals specifically with Tamil Nadu religious\n&gt; politics, and in =\r\nparticular with the role of various nexuses based overseas.\n&gt; So I decided =\r\nto jump into the eye of the storm of this scandal in order to\n&gt; investigate=\r\n whether similar nexuses were at work in this case. Naturally, at\n&gt; one lev=\r\nel I have seen this scandal through the framework of a civilization\n&gt; encou=\r\nnter in which Vedic culture is pitted against the Dravidian\n&gt; divisiveness =\r\nthat is being backed by Christian evangelism. At another level,\n&gt; I found t=\r\nhat the sensationalized media reports were too one-sided, and none\n&gt; of the=\r\nm had a single statement to report from the swami himself.\n&gt; Furthermore, t=\r\nhere was chaos and mismanagement of the crisis from Swami\n&gt; Nithyananda&#39;s i=\r\nnner circle. In hindsight, things might have turned out\n&gt; differently had t=\r\nhey managed more sensibly and faster =96 which I will\n&gt; elaborate later in =\r\nthis article. Given this, another interest of mine has\n&gt; been to extrapolat=\r\ne important lessons from this episode for other Hindu\n&gt; organizations, whic=\r\nh I predict will face similar scandals as and when their\n&gt; weaknesses becom=\r\ne understood by those opposed to them. This article\n&gt; highlights my finding=\r\ns at these multiple levels and issues.\n&gt; \n&gt; During this 2-week investigativ=\r\ne period, I have been loyal to my pledge to\n&gt; give Swami Nithyananda&#39;s orga=\r\nnization the benefit of doubt and to report\n&gt; their side of the story. Besi=\r\ndes wanting to balance out the one-sided media\n&gt; depictions, I wanted acces=\r\ns to the ashram&#39;s core group for my own research\n&gt; on the broader subject o=\r\nf civilization encounters. I respect the\n&gt; sensitivities of that organizati=\r\non consisting of many decent and dedicated\n&gt; devotees who have sacrificed a=\r\n great deal and stand to lose a lot.\n&gt; \n&gt; But I have concluded that the sit=\r\nuation is now beyond repair for Swami\n&gt; Nithyananda and that his continued =\r\ninvolvement can only damage the broader\n&gt; interests of dharma as well as je=\r\nopardize the ashramites. Along with two\n&gt; other sympathizers who are not as=\r\nhramites, I have personally recommended to\n&gt; Swami Nithyananda that the bes=\r\nt course at this stage would be for him to\n&gt; resign completely from his org=\r\nanization. He should turn it over to a small\n&gt; team of senior Hindu mahatma=\r\ns, so that the assets can be used in the best\n&gt; interests of dharma. Furthe=\r\nr, under the guidance of these mahatmas he must\n&gt; live a quiet life as a sa=\r\ndhu devoid of any institutional responsibilities.\n&gt; Because the head of any=\r\n organization must accept responsibility that &quot;the\n&gt; buck stops here,&quot; only=\r\n such a move can salvage the organization and the\n&gt; reputation of dharma at=\r\n large. Over several years, this resignation would\n&gt; hopefully reduce the m=\r\nassive pressure that has built up against him\n&gt; personally, and enable him =\r\nto live peacefully as a sadhu. It is up to him to\n&gt; accept or reject this a=\r\ndvice. The basis for this conclusion becomes clearer\n&gt; once the reader has =\r\ngone through the rest of this article.\n&gt; I want to begin by examining some =\r\nprinciples about the relationships between\n&gt; siddhis (extraordinary yogic p=\r\nowers), morality, Tantra and sex. This will\n&gt; provide the framework in whic=\r\nh to interpret what has happened. Then I will\n&gt; turn to my initial interest=\r\n in pursuing the challenges facing Hinduism in\n&gt; south India from a variety=\r\n of forces.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Siddhis (Extraordinary Yogic Powers) and Morality\n&gt; A f=\r\new days ago, I had the honor of having a two-hour private conversation\n&gt; wi=\r\nth Sri Sri Ravi Shankar at his ashram in Rishikesh. I introduced myself as\n=\r\n&gt; an independent researcher who is writing a series of books on Indian\n&gt; ci=\r\nvilization in the context of the global challenges and opportunities. One\n&gt;=\r\n of my volumes will be specifically on the major global gurus since the 196=\r\n0s\n&gt; =96 including Krishnamurti, Swami Muktananda, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi,\n&gt;=\r\n Pabhupada, among others - as well as living global gurus such as Sri Sri\n&gt;=\r\n himself. I have been investigating what happened to such gurus, in terms o=\r\nf\n&gt; the shifts in their Western followers over time, their scandals, their\n=\r\n&gt; Indian followers and critics, and also how each guru negotiated his/her\n&gt;=\r\n position sandwiched between Indian orthodoxy on one side and Western\n&gt; mod=\r\nernity on the other. The relevance of this in the context of Swami\n&gt; Nithya=\r\nnanda will become clear very soon.\n&gt; \n&gt; The first provocative question I as=\r\nked Sri Sri concerned the nature of yogic\n&gt; powers: What is the relationshi=\r\np between siddhis and morality? If siddhis\n&gt; are a scientific phenomena dea=\r\nling with powers that can be harnessed by all\n&gt; humans then one must bear i=\r\nn mind that science deals with truths that are\n&gt; morally neutral. If Einste=\r\nin was declared to have lived an immoral life it\n&gt; would not invalidate his=\r\n scientific theories. A person who designs aircrafts\n&gt; or any other complex=\r\n technological systems may or may not be moral in order\n&gt; to be effective i=\r\nn his technical work. In other words, rtam (the patterns of\n&gt; the cosmos), =\r\nwhich we discover and call science, functions independently of\n&gt; human mora=\r\nlity. This is why a scientific principle can be used either\n&gt; morally or im=\r\nmorally, because it is independent of morality. There are moral\n&gt; persons w=\r\nho lack any siddhis or even ordinary scientific competence.\n&gt; Conversely, t=\r\nhere are great siddhas (like Ravana) who lack morality. Sri\n&gt; Sri&#39;s pranaya=\r\nma techniques would also produce results for an immoral person.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Sri=\r\n Sri seemed impressed by this question, and agreed with my overall\n&gt; positi=\r\non on the independence between siddhis and morality. But he pointed\n&gt; out t=\r\nhat the moral dimension, while not determining the siddhis, was also\n&gt; impo=\r\nrtant because it led to receiving the grace of the divine. I agree with\n&gt; h=\r\nim.\n&gt; \n&gt; So there are two separate phenomena involved: (i) spiritual techno=\r\nlogies\n&gt; that are objective and that allow anyone to harness spiritual ener=\r\ngies, and\n&gt; (ii) morality which is important in itself, not for attaining s=\r\niddhis, but\n&gt; in order to have a positive relationship with the divine. Eit=\r\nher one can be\n&gt; developed without the other; however, the dharma tradition=\r\n encourages us to\n&gt; cultivate both. The reason that meditation systems pres=\r\ncribe things like\n&gt; vegetarian diet, ahimsa, etc. is because an inappropria=\r\nte lifestyle\n&gt; interferes with the mental tranquility required to advance. =\r\nThis lifestyle\n&gt; change can be appreciated regardless of whether one believ=\r\nes in a personal\n&gt; God or not. This absence of a personal God is clear in B=\r\nuddhist meditation.\n&gt; Different Hindu systems place different levels of emp=\r\nhasis upon a personal\n&gt; God for the yoga to function. This is why many secu=\r\nlar and scientifically\n&gt; minded persons are also drawn towards meditation t=\r\nechniques. In other words,\n&gt; something cannot be a science if it depends up=\r\non morality, because science\n&gt; is objective and stands independent of moral=\r\nity.\n&gt; \n&gt; The relevance of this question is as follows: Many persons who ha=\r\nve learned\n&gt; advanced meditation from Swami Nithyananda want to know if any=\r\n moral\n&gt; breaches by him would invalidate the whole Hindu claim of achievin=\r\ng higher\n&gt; states of consciousness. When a far worse sex scandal against th=\r\ne legendary\n&gt; Swami Muktananda emerged in the 1990s, involving charges by a=\r\n large number\n&gt; of his Western female disciples, the Western academy rashly=\r\n condemned not\n&gt; only one man&#39;s morality, but also the whole legitimacy of =\r\nthe Indian\n&gt; tradition itself. In that series of debates (with RISA scholar=\r\ns like Sarah\n&gt; Caldwell, etc.), I took the same position then as I am takin=\r\ng now: that\n&gt; Muktananda&#39;s capabilities in harnessing spiritual energies ar=\r\ne separate and\n&gt; independent from whether or not he violated any code of mo=\r\nrality.\n&gt; \n&gt; Patanjali warns against getting lured by siddhis which appear =\r\nalong the way\n&gt; when one practices advanced meditation persistently. One is=\r\n not supposed to\n&gt; indulge in them. This warning is found in various Hindu =\r\nsystems that deal\n&gt; with the body as a vehicle for spiritual evolution, bec=\r\nause these energies\n&gt; are very powerful and can get out of control. Another=\r\n point that is worth\n&gt; noting is that the techniques taught by Swami Nithya=\r\nnanda are not his\n&gt; original ones; he has made it clear repeatedly that the=\r\ny are from the Shiva\n&gt; Sutras which have a long history in our civilization=\r\n. I feel that he does\n&gt; have the siddhi of being able to transmit these tec=\r\nhniques very effectively\n&gt; to others. For instance, I have never before in =\r\nmy life been able to sit\n&gt; still and alert in meditation for the whole nigh=\r\nt, but he had a few hundred\n&gt; persons in a large hall achieving this. The p=\r\noint here is similar to saying\n&gt; that the mathematics and golf I have learn=\r\ned from someone is not invalidated\n&gt; when the teacher is found to be immora=\r\nl.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hence, the issue of his morality must be pursued separately and\n&gt; i=\r\nndependently from whether his siddhis are genuine.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is Tantra a Part of=\r\n Hinduism?\n&gt; \n&gt; The second question that I asked Sri Sri could not be compl=\r\netely dealt with\n&gt; in the time available for our meeting. I hope to pursue =\r\nthis some day with\n&gt; him and with various other acharyas for my own benefit=\r\n. Its significance in\n&gt; the present scandal becomes clear soon. I asked whe=\r\nther the Shiva Sutras are\n&gt; valid, pointing out that among the 112 spiritua=\r\nl enlightenment techniques\n&gt; taught in them, about 6 deal with sexual conta=\r\nct between a male yogi and a\n&gt; female yogini. Kashmir Shaivism as well as t=\r\nhe Tantra traditions have\n&gt; included exemplars that practiced these techniq=\r\nues. Recently, Osho tried to\n&gt; revive them and nowadays Deepak Chopra has b=\r\nrought some elements of these\n&gt; into his repertoire. Sunthar Visuvalingam, =\r\na US based scholar of Tantra and\n&gt; Kashmir Shaivism, is one of the voices w=\r\nho brings out the authenticity of\n&gt; these approaches in the tradition, desp=\r\nite the common rejections by society\n&gt; at large. The tradition considers it=\r\nself not suitable for mainstream society\n&gt; and is meant only for a small su=\r\nbset of people.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many popular Hindu rituals and symbols have emerged ou=\r\nt of the Tantra\n&gt; traditions =96 such as Shiva lingam, etc. The Tantra and =\r\nVedic traditions were\n&gt; not separate until recent times. The Vedic-Tantric =\r\nintegration is found in\n&gt; Adi Shankara all the way to Jiva Goswami (the gre=\r\nat integrator of\n&gt; Vaishnavism who took Ramanuja&#39;s ideas further), and even=\r\n more recently in\n&gt; the life of Sri Ramakrishna. The Bihar School of Yoga h=\r\nas Tantra\n&gt; practitioners, but they do it privately and not publicly.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI have an unpublished monograph that shows the history of this shift in\n&gt; I=\r\nndian consciousness concerning Tantra. It was under British rule that\n&gt; cer=\r\ntain Indian leaders (such as Ram Mohan Roy) started to condemn (as part\n&gt; o=\r\nf their &quot;reform&quot; of Hinduism) those aspects of Hinduism that bothered\n&gt; pur=\r\nitan Christian values. It must be noted that Christianity has had a very\n&gt; =\r\nnegative posture towards the human body starting with the Biblical episode\n=\r\n&gt; of Origin Sin. This is why female priests (called &quot;witches&quot;) got demonize=\r\nd\n&gt; by the Church in its very official genocide of several million practiti=\r\noners\n&gt; across Europe. This Church prosecution was called the Inquisition a=\r\nnd was\n&gt; widespread for a few centuries. The use of shakti and anything con=\r\ncerning\n&gt; the body as a spiritual resource was considered not only immoral =\r\nbut also\n&gt; demonic, and was outlawed with draconian enforcement. The term &quot;=\r\noccult&quot; was\n&gt; used to refer to a vast assortment of such practices and was =\r\nheavily\n&gt; condemned by the Church as the work of the Devil.\n&gt; This mentalit=\r\ny entered India under the British. The Criminal Tribes Act of\n&gt; India was p=\r\nassed by the British in the late 1800s. It listed several dozen\n&gt; tribes th=\r\nat practiced such &quot;evil&quot; techniques, and they were officially\n&gt; persecuted =\r\ninto extinction. A middle-class &quot;whitened&quot; Hinduism evolved as\n&gt; the mark o=\r\nf being &quot;civilized&quot; on British terms. We could thus be proud of\n&gt; our ident=\r\nity, now that it was &quot;cleansed&quot; of &quot;primitive&quot; practices of our\n&gt; ancestors=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; In this history of removing Tantra out of Hinduism, some people incl=\r\nude\n&gt; Swami Vivekananda among those who undermined Tantra. I disagree with =\r\nthis\n&gt; charge. He was saying a separate set of things to his Western audien=\r\nces than\n&gt; to Indians. In his Western lecture tours, he presented a Hinduis=\r\nm that\n&gt; Westerners could relate to and appreciate, but he did not ask Indi=\r\nans to\n&gt; shift their practice. It is unfortunate that after his death, the\n=\r\n&gt; Ramakrishna Mission he started has diluted itself into a sort of\n&gt; pseudo=\r\n-Christianity. Kali and other related Tantra deities, symbols and\n&gt; rituals=\r\n that were dear to Ramakrishna himself, have become &quot;hidden&quot; for the\n&gt; &quot;pri=\r\nvate&quot; use by the monks, but are marginalized publicly and considered as\n&gt; a=\r\nn embarrassment. Their lead in this direction has spread across modern\n&gt; Hi=\r\nnduism to such an extent that Vedic Hinduism has become separated from\n&gt; Ta=\r\nntra, and Tantra is now widely condemned by many Hindu gurus. This is also\n=\r\n&gt; a factor that worked against Swami Nithyananda&#39;s reputation among orthodo=\r\nx\n&gt; Hindu leaders, for he uses Tantric techniques that arouse body energies=\r\n,\n&gt; such as kundalini.\n&gt; \n&gt; My own feeling is that Tantra is making a big c=\r\nomeback. First there was\n&gt; Western popularity of distorted versions of Tant=\r\nra; but this is now being\n&gt; followed by more clinical experimentation by ps=\r\nychologists and others. The\n&gt; whole issue of latent human energies and pote=\r\nntials (both positive and\n&gt; dangerous) is a hot topic of serious scientific=\r\n investigation. Hindus should\n&gt; reclaim this aspect of their own tradition =\r\nrather than waiting for U-Turned\n&gt; (appropriated) versions to get re-export=\r\ned back to India, packaged as &quot;Made\n&gt; in USA&quot; spiritual science. This requi=\r\nres an attitude of experimentation\n&gt; under the appropriate controls to prev=\r\nent abuses and quackery.\n&gt; \n&gt; I just returned from Kumbh Mela where I walke=\r\nd amidst several tens of\n&gt; thousands of naga sadhus who were completely nak=\r\ned. I did not consider them\n&gt; as either vulgar or primitive. The old guard =\r\nof Hindu orthodoxy rejects\n&gt; Tantra at least in public, and yet lives in co=\r\nntradictions because they do\n&gt; respect the naga sadhus and also the various=\r\n symbols and rituals that have\n&gt; their foundations in Tantra. The vacuum le=\r\nft by avoiding the subject of\n&gt; Tantra has created opportunities for the li=\r\nkes of Wendy Doniger to formulate\n&gt; distorted interpretations. I feel that =\r\nHindu spiritual practitioners as well\n&gt; as intellectuals must take back con=\r\ntrol over Tantra as an intrinsic part of\n&gt; our tradition.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sex and Mora=\r\nlity\n&gt; \n&gt; Against this backdrop, I will address the issue of Swami Nithyana=\r\nnda&#39;s\n&gt; morality. Just to recap:\n&gt; My first point above has been that the m=\r\norality issue about Swami\n&gt; Nithyananda does not impact the effectiveness o=\r\nf the meditation techniques\n&gt; he has taught very successfully. Their effica=\r\ncy is best evaluated by the\n&gt; tens of thousands of practitioners for themse=\r\nlves.\n&gt; My second point was that there is nothing inherent about sex that i=\r\ns\n&gt; rejected by Hinduism across the board, although certain strains of Hind=\r\nuism\n&gt; do reject sex seeing it as harmful to spirituality.\n&gt; Here it must b=\r\ne noted that brahmacharya (involving sexual abstinence) is\n&gt; just one of th=\r\ne spiritual paths of Hinduism. The first half of my recent\n&gt; stay in Haridw=\r\nar was as a guest of the Gayatri Pariwar, one of the greatest\n&gt; and largest=\r\n Hindu movements, that does not advocate being brahmachari. Its\n&gt; founder, =\r\nits present head and its members at large, are householders and not\n&gt; brahm=\r\nacharis. But for Swami Nithyananda to claim moral authenticity under\n&gt; this=\r\n system, he would have to pronounce himself as a householder and not a\n&gt; sa=\r\nnnyasin. He has never done that, so we must examine his morality by some\n&gt; =\r\nother criteria.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another approach for him could have been to announce h=\r\nimself as an\n&gt; experimenter of Tantra for modern times, thereby making hims=\r\nelf transparent\n&gt; of any such charges. This would place him in the same cat=\r\negory as Osho. Many\n&gt; times in his public discourses and teachings, he has =\r\npraised Osho as his\n&gt; greatest teacher and enlightened exemplar. He even sa=\r\nid that many of his own\n&gt; teachings were derived from Osho. But he failed t=\r\no publicly clarify whether\n&gt; he was practicing those techniques that involv=\r\ne sex. Privately, he explained\n&gt; to me in recent days that Shiva Sutras hav=\r\ne two categories of techniques.\n&gt; Most of the sutras do not involve physica=\r\nl contact with another person and\n&gt; only use the four senses of sight, soun=\r\nd, taste and smell as pathways to\n&gt; spiritual experiences. Hence an individ=\r\nual practices these techniques\n&gt; entirely on his/her own. This path is what=\r\n he has taught thus far to the\n&gt; public. The best pursuit of this path is a=\r\ns a brahamachari according to him,\n&gt; and he has initiated many followers in=\r\nto it. But for a small number of\n&gt; persons, he feels that the 6 sutras invo=\r\nlving sexual Tantra need to be\n&gt; tested and perfected for modern times, bef=\r\nore they can be safely taught more\n&gt; widely. This he considers to be like a=\r\nny R & D done in a lab for developing\n&gt; a product.\n&gt; My sense is that he di=\r\nd practice Tantra with a very small number of persons,\n&gt; and I believe that=\r\n he even entered into written legal contracts with them to\n&gt; make sure that=\r\n both parties were clear about the arrangement. The reason for\n&gt; this &quot;Non-=\r\nDisclosure Agreement&quot; was to make sure that someone who willingly\n&gt; approac=\r\nhes him for Tantra does not later accuse him of inappropriate\n&gt; physical co=\r\nntact. On March 9 (about a week ago), I did a specific video\n&gt; interview wi=\r\nth him dealing with this issue very specifically. But this video\n&gt; was bloc=\r\nked by his ashram leaders even though he personally felt that it was\n&gt; a go=\r\nod idea to show it. I gave up arguing in favor of showing it, because\n&gt; his=\r\n ashram management took a firm stand against it. I still feel that this\n&gt; w=\r\nas a blunder they made. Swami Nithyananda is very forthright and clear in\n&gt;=\r\n that interview =96 I felt that it was the best interview of all the ones I=\r\n did\n&gt; with him, but it was never made public.\n&gt; I surmise that Ranjitha, t=\r\nhe Tamil actress in the scandalous videotape, was\n&gt; practicing Tantra with =\r\nhim. He taught her the self-control she had to\n&gt; achieve before any intimac=\r\ny. I have tried to interview her in order to get\n&gt; her side of the story, b=\r\nut so far I have not succeeded in getting through to\n&gt; her. Based on third =\r\nparty reports from some persons who are in touch with\n&gt; her, and the media =\r\nreports of her statements, her stance seems to be along\n&gt; the following lin=\r\nes: She took the sexual initiative with him on the occasion\n&gt; shown in the =\r\nvideotape, at a time when he was not fully alert. But this\n&gt; activity did n=\r\not proceed to intercourse. It was terminated. She has also\n&gt; said that the =\r\nvideos being shown on TV are manipulated versions of what\n&gt; actually happen=\r\ned, because they exaggerate the situation. They do not show\n&gt; portions wher=\r\ne he asked her to stop. Different clips from various videos\n&gt; seem to have =\r\nbeen turned into a single video by editing. She has not filed\n&gt; any complai=\r\nnt against him. So in the worst case, this was consensual sex\n&gt; between adu=\r\nlts, and that too backed by a formal written contract between the\n&gt; parties=\r\n. Because she has refused to give any statement against Swami\n&gt; Nithyananda=\r\n, she feels threatened by those who set her up and who did this\n&gt; sting ope=\r\nration. I hear that she has gone overseas to protect her safety\n&gt; from this=\r\n mafia-like conspiracy. I have not been able to corroborate this\n&gt; thesis d=\r\nirectly from her.\n&gt; \n&gt; My concern about his morality is, therefore, not bas=\r\ned on sex between\n&gt; consenting adults. Rather, my moral issue is about the =\r\nlack of transparency\n&gt; before the public. He could have openly said that he=\r\n wants to select a few\n&gt; yoginis to experiment Tantra under mutual consent.=\r\n At worst this would have\n&gt; upset many followers and pushed them away. In r=\r\nesponse to my concern over\n&gt; his lack of transparency, he could offer the a=\r\nrgument that this was a\n&gt; private activity between adults who are under no =\r\nobligation to disclose it\n&gt; to the public. After all, people do not go abou=\r\nt broadcasting their sexual\n&gt; lives. So long as this was under mutual conse=\r\nnt, he might say, it cannot be\n&gt; an offense. And if it was done under the T=\r\nantra portions of the Shiva Sutra,\n&gt; it was also an act within the Hindu tr=\r\nadition despite the controversy\n&gt; surrounding Tantra today.\n&gt; \n&gt; Having giv=\r\nen this best case argument on his behalf, I must say that there\n&gt; could als=\r\no be the alternative scenario, namely, that this was mere lust\n&gt; packaged a=\r\ns Tantric spirituality. David White, one of Wendy&#39;s Children, has\n&gt; written=\r\n extensively making the claim that all Tantra is &quot;hard core porn&quot;\n&gt; that ge=\r\nts wrapped up before the public in metaphysical mumbo-jumbo to appear\n&gt; to =\r\nbe legitimate spirituality, which he calls &quot;soft porn&quot; coating. White&#39;s\n&gt; l=\r\natest book takes this allegation to the extreme, and states that all major\n=\r\n&gt; yogic exemplars in Indian history were basically not engaged in any kind =\r\nof\n&gt; spirituality at all. Instead, he claims, they were developing personal=\r\n power\n&gt; for the purpose of exploiting others. I am unqualified to comment =\r\non whether\n&gt; Swami Nithyananda&#39;s case fits this notion of &quot;soft porn,&quot; or w=\r\nhether it was\n&gt; legitimate Tantra. Nor do I have adequate factual data of w=\r\nhat happened to\n&gt; pass judgment either way.\n&gt; This concludes what I have to=\r\n say about his morality issue as shown in the\n&gt; sex tapes.\n&gt; \n&gt; My Impressi=\r\nons of Swami Nithyananda Prior to this Scandal\n&gt; I was introduced to Swami =\r\nNithyananda a couple of years ago, by a prominent\n&gt; Hindu leader based in C=\r\nalifornia. This man was so impressed by the young\n&gt; swami that he frequentl=\r\ny called me to speak about him in glowing terms. I\n&gt; told him that I had a =\r\nguru already, and that my present interest in\n&gt; interacting with gurus was =\r\nmainly as a part of my research for my book on\n&gt; global gurus. He arranged =\r\na private meeting for me with Swami Nithyananda,\n&gt; which I used mostly to e=\r\nxplain the civilization threats facing Hinduism,\n&gt; citing numerous examples=\r\n, and questioned him on his position in this regard.\n&gt; I found him to be ve=\r\nry sharp, a great listener, and in agreement that we\n&gt; must engage social i=\r\nssues rather than pursuing the &quot;world negating&quot; or\n&gt; &quot;escapist&quot; paths that =\r\nare typical of many gurus today.\n&gt; Later on, I attended a weekend course in=\r\n USA where he taught the Patanjali\n&gt; Yoga Sutras. I have read several trans=\r\nlations of this great classical work,\n&gt; but I had never before seen it taug=\r\nht experientially. Swami Nithyananda gave\n&gt; the attendees their own persona=\r\nl inner experience of every one of the eight\n&gt; limbs of Patanjali&#39;s system,=\r\n right up to and including samadhi. This was\n&gt; quite an achievement in two =\r\ndays.\n&gt; \n&gt; Overall, my interactions with him remained centered largely on t=\r\nhe\n&gt; geopolitics of religions. I saw him as a prominent swami who was not r=\r\nunning\n&gt; away from troubling issues, such as Christian conversions and the\n=\r\n&gt; Dravidianization of Tamil identity. Given that I have been writing a book=\r\n\n&gt; for three years (now in the editing stage) on this very issue as it exis=\r\nts\n&gt; in Tamil Nadu, I was especially impressed by his experimental program =\r\nof a\n&gt; Hindu temple on wheels traveling from village to village. In each vi=\r\nllage\n&gt; this mobile temple stops and offers chanting, a talk by one of the =\r\nleaders,\n&gt; food, medicines, etc. So it combines religion with social servic=\r\ne and thus\n&gt; competes directly against Christian evangelism. Rather than bu=\r\nilding a\n&gt; temple in every village and needing a purohit in each of the tho=\r\nusands of\n&gt; villages across Tamil Nadu, the strategy was to bring to each v=\r\nillage this\n&gt; &quot;temple on wheels.&quot; What I discovered by my own independent f=\r\nact-finding was\n&gt; that wherever this temple on wheels went, the missionarie=\r\ns were upset\n&gt; because it blunted their conversion efforts.\n&gt; I attended hi=\r\ns 21-day meditation program in December 2009. The various\n&gt; techniques in i=\r\nt are very deep and transformative. The best evaluation of\n&gt; this can be do=\r\nne by the hundreds of attendees, who were divided roughly\n&gt; equally between=\r\n Indians and whites from North America.\n&gt; \n&gt; In several side conversations =\r\nwith him as well in the public forum, I\n&gt; pursued the point that I already =\r\nhave a guru since 1994, so I was not\n&gt; looking for a new guru. Since my gur=\r\nu had left the body a few years ago, I\n&gt; wanted to continue learning new te=\r\nchniques for my practice. I explained to\n&gt; him that I had previously learne=\r\nd and practiced meditation techniques from\n&gt; multiple sources for over 30 y=\r\nears, including: Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Sri\n&gt; Sri Ravi Shankar, Yogi Amrit =\r\nDesai (who certified me as a teacher), Deepak\n&gt; Chopra, Vipassana, and more=\r\n. Additionally, I had practiced numerous bhakti\n&gt; traditions, as well as fo=\r\nrmal Vedanta education from Swami Chinmayananda and\n&gt; Ramakrishna Mission. =\r\nI went through a serious study of the writings by Sri\n&gt; Aurobindo, various =\r\nMadhyamika Buddhist systems, Kashmir Shaivism, Ramana\n&gt; Maharshi, etc. So I=\r\n was not seeking a new guru like most others who took his\n&gt; courses.\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\n have to say that he never pressured me to adopt him as my new guru, and\n&gt; =\r\neven said that one must remain loyal to one&#39;s guru. To be classified as a\n&gt;=\r\n devotee/disciple of his, there are two criteria, neither of which applies =\r\nto\n&gt; me. First, there is an optional program one can sign up for, to do &quot;pa=\r\nada\n&gt; puja&quot; at the guru&#39;s feet, in order to develop a special link with him=\r\n. The\n&gt; second is that one can ask to be given an initiation with a new nam=\r\ne, in\n&gt; which case his policy is that the person must legally change his/he=\r\nr name,\n&gt; and use this new name publicly. I did not do either of these step=\r\ns. So my\n&gt; relationship is not as a devotee or disciple, but more arms-leng=\r\nth.\n&gt; \n&gt; It was a two-way street. While he taught me meditation, I brought =\r\nto him my\n&gt; scholarship on the geopolitical positioning of Hinduism which I=\r\n feel the\n&gt; gurus know only superficially. They do not adequately know thin=\r\ngs like:\n&gt; Western philosophy, neither of the religious nor the secular var=\r\niety; or\n&gt; Western history; or Western institutions that have been set up e=\r\nxplicitly to\n&gt; spread its civilization; or various global campaigns under w=\r\nay to invade\n&gt; Indian civilization through conversions, education, media, p=\r\nolitical\n&gt; policymaking and more.\n&gt; \n&gt; He requested that I should present h=\r\nim my findings on such matters so that\n&gt; he and his senior acharyas could l=\r\nearn. I told him that most gurus have\n&gt; little time to listen attentively t=\r\no a layperson like me, because the gurus\n&gt; like to do all the talking. He r=\r\neplied that he would sit and listen to me\n&gt; seriously. I made it clear that=\r\n I was disinterested in giving a short talk\n&gt; of a few minutes, because my =\r\nfindings required considerable time to be\n&gt; examined seriously. I told him =\r\nthat I would need two full days of undivided\n&gt; attention, so that I could p=\r\nresent 300 Powerpoint slides.\n&gt; \n&gt; Swami Nithyananda sent me an invitation =\r\nwhen I was in Delhi to visit his\n&gt; ashram and present my research. I was de=\r\nlighted to have such an important\n&gt; audience. I was very impressed by the f=\r\nact that he sat through two long days\n&gt; of my talks, about 12 hours per day=\r\n. He asked his 40 top acharyas and\n&gt; various thought leaders in his ashram =\r\nto sit and listen to me for both the\n&gt; days. The interactions were intense,=\r\n and I explained many points from my\n&gt; forthcoming books. I felt that he an=\r\nd I had a peer relationship, each side\n&gt; being an expert in his domain to t=\r\neach the other. After my two days of talks\n&gt; were over, he asked me to help=\r\n him incorporate my core ideas into his\n&gt; curriculum, so as to make sure th=\r\nat his teachings helped position the Vedic\n&gt; civilization properly.\n&gt; \n&gt; No=\r\n other guru in the world has invested so much time with me to try and\n&gt; lea=\r\nrn these global issues so deeply. (The only other prominent guru I know\n&gt; p=\r\nersonally who understands these issues about the external challenges is\n&gt; S=\r\nwami Dayananda Saraswati.) Most gurus tend to either be dismissive by\n&gt; res=\r\norting to spiritual loftiness, or imagine that they already know whatever\n&gt;=\r\n there is worth knowing. Thus, my primary interest in Swami Nithyananda was=\r\n\n&gt; as a vehicle to spread greater awareness of the kinds of issues that I w=\r\nas\n&gt; researching. (For instance, he bought a couple of hundred copies of th=\r\ne\n&gt; book, &quot;Invading the Sacred&quot; at the full price, and made it required rea=\r\nding\n&gt; for all his ashram residents.)\n&gt; \n&gt; I must balance this praise with =\r\ncriticism. In my 2-day talks, I had\n&gt; explicitly discussed that many gurus =\r\nwere falling prey to sex scandals,\n&gt; often with women planted as part of st=\r\ning operations, or women in the inner\n&gt; circle who got too close and let th=\r\nings get out of control. Despite these\n&gt; warnings, it seems that nothing co=\r\nncrete was done to prevent or at least\n&gt; anticipate the crisis that was to =\r\nfollow.\n&gt; \n&gt; My Approach to this Investigation\n&gt; \n&gt; When the scandal broke =\r\nout I was in Delhi. I called the Bangalore ashram\n&gt; management and found th=\r\nem confident but confused. Probably they felt that\n&gt; the matter would soon =\r\nget forgotten if left alone. But exactly the opposite\n&gt; happened, as each d=\r\nay brought fresh allegations and sensational media\n&gt; coverage. After severa=\r\nl days had passed I was invited to go to Bangalore to\n&gt; study the situation=\r\n for myself. At that time I had no clue about his Tantra\n&gt; practice with an=\r\ny women. Whatever I knew was based on what his followers\n&gt; told me, because=\r\n he was personally inaccessible for several days even after\n&gt; I reached Ban=\r\ngalore. I spent many hours daily with some of his ashram&#39;s top\n&gt; team.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n What I wrote earlier in this article actually comes later in the chronolog=\r\ny\n&gt; of my investigation. But I presented it up front because most readers a=\r\nre\n&gt; obsessed with getting my answer to only one single question: did he or=\r\n did\n&gt; he not have sex? Nothing else seems to matter to them, whereas my\n&gt; =\r\ninvestigation&#39;s emphasis has been about issues broader and more\n&gt; consequen=\r\ntial than any one man&#39;s morality.\n&gt; \n&gt; Until I concluded my fact-finding 2-=\r\nweek period recently, I was unable to\n&gt; discuss the sexual acts shown in th=\r\ne videotapes. I had to respect the\n&gt; policies of his people as part of the =\r\ntrust being placed in me to gain\n&gt; access. They also needed legal clearance=\r\n on what can and cannot be said by\n&gt; them. Their policy on the sex tapes wa=\r\ns that Swami Nithyananda would\n&gt; directly explain his acts. The Tamil actre=\r\nss&#39; lawyer was also in contact\n&gt; with them and her sensitivities had to be =\r\nrespected. The sensitivities of\n&gt; the 140-strong ashramites had to be prote=\r\ncted also. Given this set of\n&gt; circumstances facing me, I feel that it was =\r\nunfair to demand that I should\n&gt; hound him with the one critical question. =\r\nPeople have assumed that it was up\n&gt; to me to decide what would be within t=\r\nhe scope of each interview. As I have\n&gt; mentioned earlier, even after certa=\r\nin interviews were recorded by me, the\n&gt; ashram leadership used its discret=\r\nion not to air them.\n&gt; \n&gt; In response to my critics on how I conducted my i=\r\nnterviews, I would also\n&gt; like to explain why I chose to focus on the crimi=\r\nnal charges being made\n&gt; against Swami Nithyananda. Besides the sex-tape be=\r\ning off limits as\n&gt; mentioned in the foregoing paragraph, the criminal char=\r\nges became my focus\n&gt; for two reasons. These charges could be ascertained w=\r\nith objectivity =96 such\n&gt; as asking for documents on the land ownership, t=\r\nhe medical reports on the\n&gt; death of one meditation participant 2 years ago=\r\n, and so forth. The evidence\n&gt; was more clear-cut than the evidence on what=\r\n exactly happened in the\n&gt; videotapes between two persons none of whom were=\r\n willing to talk with me\n&gt; about it. Secondly, the consequences of criminal=\r\nity would be far more severe\n&gt; than mere moral fallibility. While immoral c=\r\nonduct is a big concern for the\n&gt; devotees, it is not enough grounds by its=\r\nelf for the state to confiscate the\n&gt; entire property that runs into very l=\r\narge sums of money. Also, as a matter\n&gt; of principle, regardless of whether=\r\n or not he is guilty of the morality\n&gt; charge, I felt opposed to spurious c=\r\nriminal charges being piled up by the\n&gt; irresponsible media just to create =\r\nsensationalism.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Conspiracy against Swami Nithyananda\n&gt; \n&gt; Since I =\r\nhad arrived at the scene while writing my book on the conspiracy in\n&gt; Tamil=\r\n Nadu religious politics, it was natural to start with that as my\n&gt; emphasi=\r\ns for the investigation. But in this short article I have decided to\n&gt; focu=\r\ns on the matters surrounding his conduct and his organization&#39;s conduct,\n&gt; =\r\nbecause these have assumed a more urgent nature. The details of the\n&gt; consp=\r\niracy belong in my book as corroborating evidence for my thesis there.\n&gt; Th=\r\ne types of parties reported to be behind the conspiracy, both foreign and\n&gt;=\r\n India based, were remarkably similar to the ones I have written about in t=\r\nhe\n&gt; book. So for now I shall merely summarize some of the main points conc=\r\nerning\n&gt; this conspiracy.\n&gt; \n&gt; First one must understand why Swami Nithyana=\r\nnda became such a target. He was\n&gt; virtually unknown 7 years ago, but once =\r\nhe appeared in public his popularity\n&gt; catapulted at a dramatic rate. For e=\r\nxample, last year, YouTube wrote to him\n&gt; that he was the most watched of a=\r\nll Indian spiritual leaders on the Internet\n&gt; and proposed a closer collabo=\r\nration for their viewers. This letter also\n&gt; stated that among all spiritua=\r\nl leaders worldwide (not just Indian) he was\n&gt; the second most popular one,=\r\n the Vatican being first. His meditation\n&gt; programs have become very popula=\r\nr in USA and in certain Indian states. The\n&gt; main factors are that particip=\r\nants almost invariably report experiencing\n&gt; higher states of consciousness=\r\n, and he has healed a large number of persons\n&gt; of a variety of diseases. H=\r\nis healing powers are what brought together his\n&gt; core inner group of devot=\r\nees from around the world =96 doctors, businessmen,\n&gt; IT professionals, cor=\r\nporate executives. Many of them have explained their\n&gt; personal healings fr=\r\nom terminal illnesses as the turning point in their\n&gt; lives. His meditation=\r\n programs sometimes bring up to a few thousand\n&gt; attendees for periods rang=\r\ning from a few days to several weeks.\n&gt; \n&gt; While the funds come mostly from=\r\n upper strata participants in India and USA,\n&gt; a large portion of the expen=\r\nses have been allocated to develop grass-roots\n&gt; social and spiritual progr=\r\nams focusing primarily in Tamil Nadu, his native\n&gt; state. This is where he =\r\nis seen as a threat by Dravidian as well as\n&gt; Christian forces. For instanc=\r\ne, in December 2009, about 600 villages across\n&gt; Tamil Nadu sent their loca=\r\nl &quot;Nithyananda leaders&quot; for a celebration and\n&gt; planning session in his mai=\r\nn ashram near Bangalore. I happened to be present\n&gt; for the event. These co=\r\nmmon folks, mostly from the lower strata of Tamil\n&gt; society, had walked 300=\r\n kilometers for this journey, which they saw as a\n&gt; spiritual pilgrimage. T=\r\nhe reason for the anger of Christian and Dravidian\n&gt; forces is that his act=\r\nivities have put a dampener to conversions in many\n&gt; districts, and several=\r\n Christians have returned to Hinduism by getting\n&gt; initiated formally into =\r\nhis organization. The swami himself has spoken\n&gt; against conversions, and h=\r\nas also stated that the Dravidian movement had\n&gt; made Tamil people unspirit=\r\nual in their lives, and that this had caused\n&gt; social decay. His Tamil lang=\r\nuage publications and courses have become his\n&gt; most popular ones, far exce=\r\neding the numbers in English. Also he is a very\n&gt; big threat because he is =\r\nnot a Brahmin. Because he cannot be targeted using\n&gt; the classic attack str=\r\nategies used on Brahmins, and because the masses in\n&gt; Tamil Nadu were risin=\r\ng to swell his ranks, the threat he posed to the\n&gt; existing political power=\r\n structure had to be stopped one way or another.\n&gt; \n&gt; The attack against Sw=\r\nami Nithyananda has consisted of two prongs, destroying\n&gt; his image and all=\r\neging legal misdeeds. At first a highly sensational sexual\n&gt; charge was bro=\r\nadcast in order to devastate his credibility and create an\n&gt; atmosphere in =\r\nwhich any and all kinds of outlandish allegations would be\n&gt; taken at face =\r\nvalue. Once the media and popular sentiments had been turned\n&gt; against him,=\r\n there was one amazing allegation after another in rapid\n&gt; sequence. It was=\r\n clear that none of this was spontaneous but was being\n&gt; centrally orchestr=\r\nated under a systematic plan.\n&gt; \n&gt; What became evident to me was that there=\r\n was &quot;cooperation&quot; in informal and\n&gt; unofficial ways among the media, polic=\r\ne and lower level judiciary. In fact,\n&gt; many third parties were aware of th=\r\ne attack in advance and had warned his\n&gt; people before it happened with spe=\r\ncific details of the plan. For instance,\n&gt; one of his top devotees got a ph=\r\none call from someone based in New York\n&gt; describing the media and police a=\r\nttack that was to come. His predictions\n&gt; turned out to be accurate but at =\r\nthat time the ashramites did not take the\n&gt; threat literally. He said that =\r\nfor the right sum of money he could be\n&gt; helpful in preventing such an atta=\r\nck. He claimed that the planning for this\n&gt; attack had started a year ago. =\r\nHe mentioned that a budget of Rs 200 crores\n&gt; was allocated by some oversea=\r\ns groups to demolish Hindu gurus especially in\n&gt; south India, and named two=\r\n south Indian churches as the nodal agencies to\n&gt; coordinate this strategic=\r\n plan. (I am presently pursuing these leads as part\n&gt; of my book investigat=\r\nion.)\n&gt; There was another concrete extortion effort about eleven or twelve =\r\ndays\n&gt; prior to the scandal breaking out. A lawyer contacted them and claim=\r\ned that\n&gt; his client had compromising videos, and that the client was seeki=\r\nng money or\n&gt; else they would get released. The same intermediary later sen=\r\nt a letter\n&gt; containing a variety of unsubstantiated criminal allegations a=\r\ngainst Swami\n&gt; Nithyananda, and this letter&#39;s distribution list included In=\r\ndia&#39;s Prime\n&gt; Minister, President, Sonya Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, various C=\r\nhief Ministers\n&gt; and police heads, various national criminal investigation =\r\nand security\n&gt; organizations. I have a copy of this letter, and it makes th=\r\ne Nithyananda\n&gt; organization seem like a terrorist outfit that needs to be =\r\nattacked for the\n&gt; sake of public safety. This letter along with a DVD of t=\r\nhe sex video was\n&gt; delivered to the Chief Minister of Karnataka state two h=\r\nours before the\n&gt; videotape was first aired. Clearly, the attack was well p=\r\nlanned and executed\n&gt; across many locations, and was persistently carried o=\r\nut over several days.\n&gt; This is not the work of some isolated individuals.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; There were warnings given to individuals in the ashram that their phon=\r\nes\n&gt; were being tapped and that they better leave to save their own lives,\n=\r\n&gt; because something horrible was about to happen. One friendly man based in=\r\n\n&gt; Pune who runs a magazine and is a devotee of Swami Nithyananda, told the=\r\n\n&gt; ashram a week in advance of the attack that some such catastrophe would\n=\r\n&gt; happen. He named his source as a man in the Bangalore Press Club. Another=\r\n\n&gt; publisher in Hyderabad who distributes Swami Nithyananda&#39;s books in Telu=\r\ngu,\n&gt; called three times to warn that a graphic video would be released and=\r\n gave a\n&gt; precise time for this to happen. It was also reported that an Ame=\r\nrican\n&gt; devotee who had fallen out of the ashram was working in association=\r\n with one\n&gt; Jody Razdik who specializes in guru bashing at a prominent web =\r\nsite. He was\n&gt; being helped by an Indian based in San Diego, who was once v=\r\nery deeply\n&gt; involved inside the Nithyananda organization but had turned ma=\r\nlicious. The\n&gt; only man who has openly come out as the main accuser was an =\r\nashramite who\n&gt; had a falling out when he got demoted due to his conduct. I=\r\nt was recently\n&gt; reported that he had a prior criminal record against him b=\r\nut nobody in the\n&gt; ashram had checked out his background before admitting h=\r\nim.\n&gt; \n&gt; There were constant threats received to harass the ashramites and =\r\nscare them\n&gt; away, with claims that &quot;narcotics will be planted to cause arr=\r\nest warrants.&quot;\n&gt; The actions by the police were being leaked to the media a=\r\nhead of time and\n&gt; even to the opposing side, leading to numerous &quot;tips&quot; re=\r\nceived by &quot;friends&quot;\n&gt; asking the ashram dwellers to run away before &quot;the at=\r\ntack comes.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; But even after a couple of weeks since the scandal has er=\r\nupted, the lawyers\n&gt; for Swami Nithyananda&#39;s ashram have failed to get copi=\r\nes of any concrete\n&gt; charges filed with the police, except a few trivial on=\r\nes. Each time they\n&gt; approach for specific details they are told that there=\r\n is no formal charge,\n&gt; except relatively minor ones. So the intimidation h=\r\nas been carried out\n&gt; mainly through media reports, without any legal due p=\r\nrocess starting where\n&gt; facts and arguments could get cross-examined. This =\r\nlack of formal charges\n&gt; has enabled an atmosphere of intimidation using ru=\r\nmors and threats that\n&gt; cannot be pinned down officially.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is import=\r\nant to contrast this with the manner in which Indian media\n&gt; treats scandal=\r\ns facing Islamic or Christian groups. The numerous scandals\n&gt; occurring ove=\r\nrseas often get blocked by Indian media entirely, or are given\n&gt; mild treat=\r\nment with tremendous sensitivity, in order to be seen as &quot;secular&quot;\n&gt; and no=\r\nt &quot;communal.&quot; By contrast every kind of allegation against any Hindu\n&gt; grou=\r\np gets clubbed in one homogeneous category and treated as a social\n&gt; scourg=\r\ne equivalent to terror groups.\n&gt; \n&gt; The media&#39;s hounding mentality and mafi=\r\na tactics deserve to be condemned. In\n&gt; the Swami Nithyananda case, they ha=\r\nve used carrots and sticks to lure and\n&gt; threaten, using whatever would get=\r\n them more sensational footage. Several TV\n&gt; stations and journalists campe=\r\nd out in Haridwar and sent me emails\n&gt; requesting my help in arranging an i=\r\nnterview. When I failed to deliver\n&gt; (because it was not up to me to delive=\r\nr any such thing), some of them turned\n&gt; nasty against me. One TV woman pro=\r\nmised the swami&#39;s people &quot;positive&quot;\n&gt; coverage if she got an exclusive. But=\r\n after the interview, she betrayed them\n&gt; and turned it into more distortio=\r\nn and smut. This led Swami Nithyananda&#39;s\n&gt; handlers to give interviews to m=\r\nore stations in order to counteract this\n&gt; distortion. But the more they sa=\r\nid before TV cameras, the worse the scandal\n&gt; became. One station was blata=\r\nnt in its threat to the swami&#39;s assistant: &quot;If\n&gt; you don&#39;t give us an inter=\r\nview right away, we will show you the power of the\n&gt; media to destroy you.&quot;=\r\n At one point a major TV station also wanted to drag\n&gt; in Ramakrishna Missi=\r\non with similar allegations, but someone was able to\n&gt; stop that.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fail=\r\nures of Swami Nithyananda&#39;s Organization\n&gt; \n&gt; Hindu tradition separates thr=\r\nee kinds of Varna (skills), each representing a\n&gt; form of social capital, a=\r\nnd these three were never supposed to be\n&gt; concentrated in a single person,=\r\n thereby preventing too much concentration\n&gt; of power. I use the terms Brah=\r\nmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya not as birth based\n&gt; &quot;caste,&quot; but as merit based=\r\n social capital and areas of competence. The\n&gt; Brahmin job description focu=\r\nses on spirituality and research; Kshatriya on\n&gt; governance, politics and l=\r\neadership; and Vaishyas on commerce and financial\n&gt; capital. Swami Nithyana=\r\nnda had persons with Brahmin qualities performing\n&gt; duties that demand Ksha=\r\ntriya and Vaishya skills. This was counterproductive.\n&gt; The ashram leaders =\r\nwere selected and trained for skills and roles that are\n&gt; very different th=\r\nan this situation demands. Too often their bhakti and\n&gt; spiritual practice =\r\nsubstituted for professional competence in managing a\n&gt; rapidly growing glo=\r\nbal enterprise. The sole emphasis was placed on\n&gt; traditional Brahmin quali=\r\nties, and none on what would be considered\n&gt; Kshatriya qualities.\n&gt; For exa=\r\nmple, there are a large number of white devotees who do have\n&gt; Kshatriyata =\r\n- leadership expertise, courage and commitment. But even after\n&gt; this attac=\r\nk the ashram organization has blundered in its failure to leverage\n&gt; and de=\r\nploy them. I met some of these Westerners at the Kumbh and found them\n&gt; rem=\r\narkably willing to stand up for their guru, but nobody had bothered to\n&gt; or=\r\nganize them and take advantage of the fact that Swami Nithyananda has a\n&gt; g=\r\nlobal following. Instead of such initiatives to deal with the crisis, his\n&gt;=\r\n organization was in utter chaos, reacting to each &quot;hit&quot; by the other side.=\r\n\n&gt; Its leaders were running scared, driven by one rumor after another.\n&gt; De=\r\ncisions were being made in desperation and panic. The group was\n&gt; cognitive=\r\nly disoriented and many of its members were psychologically\n&gt; breaking down=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; The organization was too much of a one-man show with the leaders ope=\r\nrating\n&gt; like children dependent on the swami for every decision. The swami=\r\n had\n&gt; become the iconic object of the ashram&#39;s inner circle. Their proximi=\r\nty to\n&gt; him became their measure of personal power and identity. This is cl=\r\nassical\n&gt; cult-like behavior that cannot survive the onslaughts that are in=\r\nevitable\n&gt; nowadays. Such a concentration of all varnas into one man not on=\r\nly makes an\n&gt; enterprise incompetent, but it also can also get to the leade=\r\nr&#39;s head and\n&gt; make him power hungry. Especially when the guru has siddhis,=\r\n this power can\n&gt; easily become co-opted by his ego into a dangerous mixtur=\r\ne. The result is\n&gt; that he surrounds himself with sycophants who tell him w=\r\nhat he wants to\n&gt; hear, and this feedback loop of self glorification turns =\r\ninto group\n&gt; delusion.\n&gt; \n&gt; I noticed this in the form of the inner circle&#39;=\r\ns inability to make common\n&gt; sense judgments, and their misrepresenting the=\r\n facts to their leader by\n&gt; giving him too much &quot;good news.&quot; The result was=\r\n that the honest truth did\n&gt; not come out fast enough to allow pragmatic an=\r\nd realistic planning. I had a\n&gt; difficult time to get dependable informatio=\r\nn, and the stories kept changing\n&gt; not only over time but also between one =\r\nperson and another within the group.\n&gt; I could not tell if there was a cove=\r\nr up and if new lies were fabricated to\n&gt; cover prior lies. In such an atmo=\r\nsphere one cannot tell which individuals\n&gt; might have a separate stake and =\r\nvested interest from the group. Lacking\n&gt; competent Kshatriyas, the swami h=\r\nad not anticipated that such a crisis was\n&gt; ever possible, despite the fact=\r\n that outsiders (including myself in my 2-day\n&gt; talks at his ashram) had ex=\r\nplained to them the threats facing every\n&gt; prominent Hindu mahatma today.\n&gt;=\r\n While on the one hand I blame those in positions of responsibility at the\n=\r\n&gt; ashram, ultimately Swami Nithyananda bears the responsibility as he selec=\r\nted\n&gt; them, defined their roles, evaluated their performance, motivated and=\r\n\n&gt; supervised them very closely. In this regard, his spiritual capabilities=\r\n had\n&gt; failed to evaluate those very close to him as well as the external r=\r\neality.\n&gt; An enlightened master must do better than this, or else he must n=\r\not try to\n&gt; control everything so personally.\n&gt; I acknowledge that being a =\r\nglobal guru is very demanding today, given that\n&gt; one has to represent a ve=\r\nry old tradition authentically and yet in a manner\n&gt; that appeals to modern=\r\n people. This is why Hindu leaders need a crash course\n&gt; on matters that ar=\r\ne well beyond the traditional education in their own\n&gt; sampradayas (lineage=\r\ns).\n&gt; \n&gt; Hindu Chaos\n&gt; Swami Nithyananda&#39;s own support base in India has st=\r\narted to distance itself\n&gt; out of self preservation amidst all the rumors a=\r\nnd slander. His closest\n&gt; supporters were not approached soon enough with h=\r\nis side of the story, and\n&gt; by the time they were approached the damage to =\r\nhis credibility was already\n&gt; irreversible. They did not want to risk being=\r\n associated with a &quot;fallen\n&gt; guru.&quot; Many Hindu gurus have started to public=\r\nly lash out against the\n&gt; &quot;fallen godman&quot;; others became silent or neutral =\r\npublicly, while offering\n&gt; private sympathy but refusing to stick their nec=\r\nks out.\n&gt; \n&gt; One factor is that the swami&#39;s approach was too conservative f=\r\nor some and\n&gt; too liberal for others. It is too filled with deities, symbol=\r\ns and rituals\n&gt; of a very orthodox kind for the aesthetic taste of modern g=\r\nlobal gurus who\n&gt; propagate a whitened, Westernized &quot;clean&quot; Hinduism that i=\r\ns abstract and\n&gt; metaphysical but devoid of imagery associated with &quot;primit=\r\nive paganism.&quot; At\n&gt; the other end of the spectrum are orthodox Hindu leader=\r\ns who find his idea\n&gt; of youthful dancing, celebration, and liberal atmosph=\r\nere to be not &quot;real&quot;\n&gt; Hinduism. A couple of shankaracharyas interviewed on=\r\n NDTV lashed out against\n&gt; &quot;false&quot; gurus and claimed that only the shankara=\r\ncharyas had the authority to\n&gt; certify who was qualified to be a guru. So S=\r\nwami Nithyananda fits neither\n&gt; end of this spectrum.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many of the guru=\r\ns I met have told me in confidence that they fear that\n&gt; similar attacks ar=\r\ne coming to more Hindu gurus, but that there is no central\n&gt; Hindu mechanis=\r\nm to deal with these episodes along the lines of various\n&gt; Church mechanism=\r\ns that intervene when Christianity faces a scandal. I sent\n&gt; feelers to the=\r\n Hindu Dharma Acharya Sabha as to whether it should offer to\n&gt; step in and =\r\ntake over the ashram and its related organizations, thereby\n&gt; bringing new =\r\nmanagement to clean up matters and bring stability to the\n&gt; enterprise. I w=\r\nas told that while this was a &quot;good idea in principle,&quot; it\n&gt; was not practi=\r\ncal because HDAS is simply not set up to deal with this.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Way Forwa=\r\nrd\n&gt; My overriding concern throughout this investigation has been to find a=\r\n way\n&gt; to do damage control in order to protect the broader interests of dh=\r\narma.\n&gt; This requires a pragmatic approach. Given the state of affairs, it =\r\nseems\n&gt; that the mess cannot be created without the swami leaving the movem=\r\nent and\n&gt; going into a strictly private life of meditation and self inquiry=\r\n. I worry\n&gt; for the young ashramites who I feel are amazing individuals but=\r\n in need of\n&gt; proper mentoring. They have a solid commitment to the cause a=\r\nnd their\n&gt; personal spiritual paths, but they lack the sophistication and m=\r\naturity to\n&gt; deal with what they face today.\n&gt; \n&gt; Swami Nithyananda should =\r\nresign immediately and hand over all his\n&gt; organizations to senior spiritua=\r\nl masters, preferably Shaivites practicing\n&gt; the Shiva Sutras and related t=\r\nraditions. He told me in an interview hat I\n&gt; recorded on March 9th that he=\r\n was willing to leave everything and become a\n&gt; wandering sadhu again. I wi=\r\nsh that interview had been aired.\n&gt; \n&gt; The new spiritual leaders would give=\r\n the ashram a new life and chance to\n&gt; revive itself. It could either remai=\r\nn a place for spiritual training or turn\n&gt; itself into a Hindu social servi=\r\nce organization. Either way it would be a\n&gt; better outcome than the likely =\r\nalternative of the government stepping in to\n&gt; take over the ashram and tur=\r\nn it over to administrators who are not\n&gt; positively disposed to Hindu spir=\r\nituality =96 as has happened in numerous\n&gt; similar cases of government take=\r\novers of Hindu temples and organizations\n&gt; despite government claims of its=\r\n actions being &quot;secular&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Besides giving up the organization, Swami Ni=\r\nthyananda should return to his\n&gt; personal sadhana under the guidance of the=\r\nse spiritual leaders. Let them\n&gt; evaluate him and his organization, and iss=\r\nue their independent report to the\n&gt; public. Swami Nithyananda should fearl=\r\nessly and humbly submit himself to\n&gt; their judgment of what happened and wh=\r\nat the remedies ought to be.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hinduism has survived for many millennia =\r\nand faced many kinds of crises,\n&gt; just like all the other major religions o=\r\nf the world. It has its own\n&gt; internal resources and mechanisms to deal wit=\r\nh such situations. These need\n&gt; to be put to use and they need to become mo=\r\ndernized. This is not the last\n&gt; such scandal Hindu groups are going to fac=\r\ne in the near future.\n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Sense of Distinction and of good and evil=\r\n is bound to persist so long as\n&gt; one does not realize God&quot; - Ramakrishna P=\r\naramahamsa\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
