Silk - I am not really sure if it is mandatory to kill the cocoons for m=\r\naking silk. This may very well be the way silk is extracted now! Every thin=\r\ng is so commercialised. Once, people used to cut only the dry branches and =\r\nwas concerned that they do not want to make a tree loose its green branches=\r\n. Now a days, world leaders argue poluting the environment is their right a=\r\nnd only negotiate on the amount of polution that may be allowed!\n\n3. Prayer=\r\n and Mantra are two different things! Prayers does not have any language ba=\r\nrriers. Mantras on the other hand are composed by/revealed to great sages a=\r\nnd passed on. If a great sage belonging to your language has passed on mant=\r\nras in local language, they can very well be used.\n\nPronounciations and Vib=\r\nrations are important, but, the involvement and concentration are perhaps m=\r\nore required. I feel more bliss full when I sit silent with out any mantra =\r\nand try my best to avoid thoughts.\n\nBest regards,\nVijay\n\n--- In vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com, Sudha Metllapalli &lt;metllapalli@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. I can =\r\nanswer the first query regarding milk. If a=C2=A0 calf is allowed to drink =\r\nlots of milk from its mother=C2=A0 it is not good for the baby&#39;s health and=\r\n for the mother storing so much milk in her body is harmful. Hence the milk=\r\n has to be removed or the cow and the calf&#39;s health will be in danger or to=\r\n say they can die. This was told by my mother who had nurtured a cow in the=\r\n village back then. These days I don&#39;t consider milk to be auspicious as an=\r\nimals are given hormones etc to extract more milk.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Regarding silk i=\r\nts a good question I would want to know about it too.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. My personal u=\r\nnderstanding: There&#39;s no need to chant prayers in sanskrit but the intonati=\r\nons and vibrations coming from the mantras is what counts and makes it more=\r\n effective.=C2=A0 God can understand any language afterall he is the creato=\r\nr. Christians\n&gt;  say their prayers in English. You have to learn sanskrit t=\r\no understand the prayers alternatively if you surf the internet many of the=\r\n day to day mantras are given with meaning. \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Sudha=C2=A0 \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Thu, 12/17/09, ramypras &lt;ramypras@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: r=\r\namypras &lt;ramypras@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Basic queries\n&gt; To: vedic-=\r\nwisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Thursday, December 17, 2009, 10:02 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;       \n&gt;       \n&gt;     =\r\n  Namaskara!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I have some very basic questions and was not convin=\r\nced by answers that are usually given.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 1. How can milk be consid=\r\nered pious? I understand that Cow is a divinely being and is worshiped as `=\r\nKamadenu&#39;. But in actual sense we are extracting milk and preventing the ca=\r\nlf from having its share of milk...Is this not a sin to stop a young calf f=\r\nrom having milk from its mother?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 2. How can silk cloth be consid=\r\nered sacred for worship? Silk is obtained by killing thousand&#39;s of cocoon. =\r\nUsing a product which is obtained by killing so many living beings and we b=\r\neing a cause for such an action...Are we not doing sin?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 3. I tel=\r\nl my daily prayers but I have not learnt Sanskrit and don&#39;t understand the =\r\nmeaning of many prayers that I say everyday. Why is it necessary to say the=\r\n slokas in Sanskrit and not other language??\n&gt; \n&gt; Will our Supreme Lord not=\r\n understand other languages ?? or is it just bcos Sanskrit has been used fr=\r\nom the very early times it is still in practice..\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ~Ramya\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
