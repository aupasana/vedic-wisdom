The \n&gt; moment you install fire, it=\r\n IS alive! There is no need to make it alive \n&gt; by doing any step. This is =\r\nthe big difference between an idol and fire.\n&gt; \n&gt; The only thing is that tw=\r\no kinds of fire called Havyavaaha (auspicious \n&gt; fire - carrier of offering=\r\ns to deities) and Kravyaada (inauspicious fire \n&gt; - carrier of all that per=\r\nishes). Both are installed when you install \n&gt; fire. With the RigVedic mant=\r\nra &quot;kravyaadanagnim prahiNomi dUraM&quot; mantra \n&gt; given in the manual, we requ=\r\nest the Kravyaada fire that carries corpses \n&gt; to Yama to leave our fire an=\r\nd Havyavaaha fire that carried offerings to \n&gt; deities to remain.\n&gt; \n&gt; If y=\r\nou want to do a panchopachara pooja to fire, you can do it after \n&gt; &quot;chatva=\r\nari&quot; mantra praising fire. Offer the panchopachara pooja to fire \n&gt; and the=\r\nn proceed to make the preliminary offerings to Prajapati, Indra \n&gt; etc.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Gayatri mantra is a nice mantra and I like the emphasis on it by some \n&gt; =\r\nspiritual communities. But, Ganapathi homam for a few months is a good \n&gt; i=\r\ndea for anybody.\n&gt; \n&gt; Feel free to use the manual or any other simpler or m=\r\nore complex \n&gt; procedure and also to incorporate some steps from manual int=\r\no other \n&gt; procedures.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, if one starts=\r\n fire, imagines that a specific deity is in fire, \n&gt; makes offerings revere=\r\nntially and meditates in front of that fire, one \n&gt; WILL eventually make sp=\r\niritual progress. That itself is sufficient, even \n&gt; if all the mantras are=\r\n missing. Mantras are there to invoke certain \n&gt; notions in the astral body=\r\n and aid in progress.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, we make 5 preliminary offerings in =\r\npoorvangam. One is to \n&gt; Prajapati, who controls the binding of our self-aw=\r\nareness to \n&gt; Moolaadhaara chakra (physical realm). Next 3 offerings are to=\r\n Indra, \n&gt; Agni and Soma. The fiery Agni and the cool Soma control the chan=\r\nnels \n&gt; Pingala and Ida (solar and lunar - ). The divine worlds (chakras) l=\r\nying \n&gt; in the middle channel of Sushumna are controlled by Indra, leader o=\r\nf \n&gt; gods. So, we are making offerings to the controllers of the 3 main \n&gt; =\r\nchannels through which self-awareness can ascend through the higher \n&gt; real=\r\nms of awareness (chakras). Finally, with &quot;OM bhUrbhuvassuvaH \n&gt; svaahaa&quot;, w=\r\ne are making offerings to a different aspect of Prajapati \n&gt; (Creator/Proge=\r\nnitor) who is responsible for creating the 3 levels - \n&gt; physical (bhuH), m=\r\nental (bhuvaH) and spiritual (suvaH).\n&gt; \n&gt; We are basically setting the sta=\r\nge for self-awareness to ascend to \n&gt; higher realms of awareness, through t=\r\nhe three channels.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the uttarangam, we make 6 main offerings:\n&gt; \n&gt; (=\r\n1) To Agni with &quot;OM bhUH svaahaa&quot;. Fire god is the representative of \n&gt; god=\r\n in the physical plane.\n&gt; (2) To Vaayu with &quot;OM bhvaH svaahaa&quot;. Wind god is=\r\n the representative of \n&gt; god in the mental plane.\n&gt; (3) To Surya with &quot;OM =\r\nsuvaH svaahaa&quot;. Sun god is the representative of \n&gt; god in the spiritual pl=\r\nane.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Note: One may have experienced nice things at any of the three l=\r\nevels \n&gt; during the homam. So thank the controllers of the 3 levels.]\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n(4) To Prajati, for creating various beings, experiences and states that \n&gt;=\r\n we experience.\n&gt; (5) To Vishnu, for sustaining various beings, experiences=\r\n and states \n&gt; that we experience.\n&gt; (6) To Rudra, for destroying various b=\r\neings, experiences and states that \n&gt; we experience.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *       =\r\n *\n&gt; \n&gt; These are the main offerings. Making these offerings is not a guara=\r\nntee \n&gt; of getting anything. Not making these offerings need to preclude on=\r\ne \n&gt; from anything. In the end, thoughts come to one based on one&#39;s \n&gt; cond=\r\nitioning and one experiences what those thoughts are worth. Ritual \n&gt; is an=\r\n attempt to purify thoughts. Following the procedure in the manuals \n&gt; is n=\r\not necessary. But, it is ONE GOOD template for creating the correct \n&gt; noti=\r\nons inside one.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; We will be doing our 4th annu=\r\nal Mass Satya Narayana vratam in greater \n&gt; Boston (Lowell, Massachusetts) =\r\ntomorrow (Saturday, 2011 May 7) from 10 \n&gt; am to 2:30 pm (4 hours west of G=\r\nMT).
