Our Sanatana Dharma prescribes Yuga Dharma. Every Y=\r\nuga has its Manu. In this era of many false swamijis, how to spot Manu!? Ho=\r\nw to know what to do and what not to do? Whats right and whats wrong? Sanat=\r\nana dharma encompasses Yuga dharma too. While Sanatana Dharma has dharma pr=\r\nescribed for every varna, why not for every yuga? Does it make the dharma n=\r\non-sanatana?  The context of Sanatana dharma needs to be understood right. =\r\n I will give what my understanding is. WHat I express in words here is subj=\r\nect to my imperfections in communication and limitation of verbal communica=\r\ntion.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Now, its becomes very difficult for human mind to comprehe=\r\nnd all of these and follow everything picture perfect. The present day scie=\r\nnce is an offshoot of a much stronger Indian version of Sankhya and (Tantra=\r\n/Kriya )Yoga. There have been many great people who had tried to achieve ma=\r\nny things including realization by their self-effort, by mastering and winn=\r\ning over the nature and its laws. Prakriti is rich with such laws. So what =\r\nis the way out?  The Lord is all merciful. It is precisely this that Bhagav=\r\nan Ramana has countered in his Upadesa Sara &quot;Kartrur agnaya Prapyate Phalam=\r\n, Karma Kim Param, Karma thajjadam&quot;. Its a big blow to all the ones who bel=\r\nieve in cause-and-effect reslationships in the context of realization. It i=\r\ns precisely this that Lord Sri krishna countered and asked Arjuna to surren=\r\nder ALL of his dharma unto himself  - &quot;Sarva dharman parityajya&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;Self-Realization alone is the one and only solution. So only a realized p=\r\nerson can be right and perfect? - Yes!  But, as humans, unrealized yet, our=\r\n perfection lies in simple, humble and total surrender that The Lord descri=\r\nbes in The Gita. Namasamkirtanam, Bhakti and Surrender are sure ways of get=\r\nting protection. By this we do not fight the laws or win them trusting our =\r\neffort or mind&#39;s power. But leave the result to Lord and faithfully execute=\r\n the dharma to the extent to which it is possible in a contaminated world o=\r\nf Kali today. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;The difference between science and our Indian scr=\r\niptures including Charuvaka (as I have heard), were works which were done b=\r\ny invoking and surrendering to The Lord. Science is NOT. Science does not k=\r\nnow God and refuses to recognise it. That is why science is science and has=\r\n its limitation. Sanatana dharma , as I understand, never let anything out,=\r\n it comprehended ALL forms of sciences, philosophies etc etc.. In that sens=\r\ne it was holistic and tied it to The ONE who IS!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;The Thalidomide=\r\n &#39;aushada&#39; of today is a product of human mind&#39;s scientific pursuit. Scienc=\r\ne&#39;s falsified basis can produce many chemicals which reacts in desirable or=\r\n non-desriable ways to the extent to which humans have reach (complex lab i=\r\nnstruments, experiments, guinea pig experiments to testing on humans). Ayur=\r\nveda, for instance, a Rshi proktam proclaims the Truth. ANY disease is due =\r\nto the imbalance of the Vata-Pitta-Kapha. This cannot be contested. Science=\r\n needs minimum 100 years to comprehend the three. Science (sense based bahi=\r\nrmukha approach in pursuit of Truth)  is an arrogant little child who by th=\r\ne virtue of Kali has got some importance today. Can Ayurveda solve the prob=\r\nlem? Yes, if and only if it is understood in the right manner. Can any othe=\r\nr methods offered by our Rshis can solve the problem? Yes, if and only if i=\r\nt is recieved and practised in exact same manner as they described it.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;So how to do it?  - Its one&#39;s own Prarabda that decides. So what can=\r\n help?? - Grace of The Lord alone can help! nothing else. Thalidomide may p=\r\nroduce adverse reaction in person A (unfortunate ones) but not in B. Why? S=\r\ncience needs more time to answer. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;The answer is Prarabda and Gr=\r\nace. Grace can effect anything. Science can never comprehend Divine Grace. =\r\nCan one measure the love and yearning of a child in a remote boarding schoo=\r\nl missing her mother? Can science quantify human love? Leave alone bhakti a=\r\nnd Grace!! At the maximum science can define the child&#39;s yearning as &quot;a men=\r\ntal and emotional phenomenon by which a human goes through and exhibits emo=\r\ntional states due to absence of company of comforting nature&quot;   This is lik=\r\ne a blind man saying the elephant is like a long rope (touching its tail) a=\r\nnd another blind man saying that an elephant is a big boulder (touching its=\r\n belly).. Science or technology cannot &#39;solve&#39; the problems. It has indeed =\r\nmade the problems more complicated, in an attempt to solve them.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;I suppose my attempt to clarify has helped clarify your query.

A well learned(so-=\r\ncalled) man in modern times soon gets outdated as science gets &#39;updated&#39;. I=\r\ns it not true that when no of people who need to upgrade themselves have in=\r\ncreased?

Rshi is a Drshta a &#39;seer&#39; who see the Truth as is.=\r\n Can there be a better scientist? Today&#39;s scientist needs a most complex la=\r\nb with lost of instruments to measure accurately and follow laws, formulae =\r\netc. Any error is very costly. Governments will apologise and easily get aw=\r\nay by giving drugs which cause side-effects. Rshis have no take away from t=\r\nhis world.

Our Sanatana Dharma prescribes Yuga Dharma. Every Yuga has its Manu. =\r\nIn this era of many false swamijis, how to spot Manu!? How to know what to =\r\ndo and what not to do? Whats right and whats wrong? Sanatana dharma encompa=\r\nsses Yuga dharma too. While Sanatana Dharma has dharma prescribed for every=\r\n varna, why not for every yuga? Does it make the dharma non-sanatana? &nbsp=\r\n;The context of Sanatana dharma needs to be understood right. &nbsp;I will =\r\ngive what my understanding is. WHat I express in words here is subject to m=\r\ny imperfections in communication and limitation of verbal communication.&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Now, its becomes very difficult for human mind to=\r\n comprehend all of these and follow everything picture perfect. The present=\r\n day science is an offshoot of a much stronger Indian version of Sankhya an=\r\nd (Tantra/Kriya )Yoga.&nbsp;There have been many great people who had tried=\r\n to achieve many things including realization by their self-effort, by mast=\r\nering and winning over the nature and its laws.&nbsp;Prakriti is rich with =\r\nsuch laws. So what is the way out? &nbsp;The Lord is all merciful.&nbsp;It =\r\nis precisely this that Bhagavan Ramana has countered in his Upadesa Sara &quot;K=\r\nartrur agnaya Prapyate Phalam, Karma Kim Param, Karma thajjadam&quot;. Its a big=\r\n blow to all the ones who believe in cause-and-effect reslationships in the=\r\n context of realization. It is precisely this that Lord Sri krishna counter=\r\ned and asked Arjuna to surrender ALL of his dharma unto himself &nbsp;- &quot;Sa=\r\nrva dharman parityajya&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Self-Realization alone=\r\n is the one and only solution. So only a realized person can be right and p=\r\nerfect? - Yes! &nbsp;But, as humans, unrealized yet, our perfection lies in=\r\n simple, humble and total surrender that The Lord describes in The Gita. Na=\r\nmasamkirtanam, Bhakti and Surrender are sure ways of getting protection. By=\r\n this we do not fight the laws or win them trusting our effort or mind&#39;s po=\r\nwer. But leave the result to Lord and faithfully execute the dharma to the =\r\nextent to which it is possible in a contaminated world of Kali today.&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;The difference between science and our Indian =\r\nscriptures including Charuvaka (as I have heard), were works which were don=\r\ne by invoking and surrendering to The Lord. Science is NOT. Science does no=\r\nt know God and refuses to recognise it. That is why science is science and =\r\nhas its limitation. Sanatana dharma , as I understand, never let anything o=\r\nut, it comprehended ALL forms of sciences, philosophies etc etc.. In that s=\r\nense it was holistic and tied it to The ONE who IS!&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;div&gt;The Thalidomide &#39;aushada&#39; of today is a product of human mind&#39;s scient=\r\nific pursuit. Science&#39;s falsified basis can produce many chemicals which re=\r\nacts in desirable or non-desriable ways to the extent to which humans have =\r\nreach (complex lab instruments, experiments, guinea pig experiments to test=\r\ning on humans). Ayurveda, for instance, a Rshi proktam proclaims the Truth.=\r\n ANY disease is due to the imbalance of the Vata-Pitta-Kapha. This cannot b=\r\ne contested. Science needs minimum 100 years to comprehend the three. Scien=\r\nce (sense based bahirmukha approach in pursuit of Truth) &nbsp;is an arroga=\r\nnt little child who by the virtue of Kali has got some importance today. Ca=\r\nn Ayurveda solve the problem? Yes, if and only if it is understood in the r=\r\night manner. Can any other methods offered by our Rshis can solve the probl=\r\nem? Yes, if and only if it is recieved and practised in exact same manner a=\r\ns they described it.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;So how to do it? &nbsp;- I=\r\nts one&#39;s own Prarabda that decides. So what can help?? - Grace of The Lord =\r\nalone can help! nothing else. Thalidomide may produce adverse reaction in p=\r\nerson A (unfortunate ones) but not in B. Why? Science needs more time to an=\r\nswer.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;The answer is Prarabda and Grace. G=\r\nrace can effect anything. Science can never comprehend Divine Grace. Can on=\r\ne measure the love and yearning of a child in a remote boarding school miss=\r\ning her mother? Can science quantify human love? Leave alone bhakti and Gra=\r\nce!! At the maximum science can define the child&#39;s yearning as &quot;a mental an=\r\nd emotional phenomenon by which a human goes through and exhibits emotional=\r\n states due to absence of company of comforting nature&quot; &nbsp; This is like=\r\n a blind man saying the elephant is like a long rope (touching its tail) an=\r\nd another blind man saying that an elephant is a big boulder (touching its =\r\nbelly)..

(Due lack of any =\r\nother alternatives) world helplessly clings to science.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Moderation is the right way to go in utilizing anything, Scie=\r\nnce is no exception. Unfortunately no leadership to call a spade a spade. T=\r\nhe atheist rules in the name of science today. In short period it might hav=\r\ne seen success. But what is surfacing is the blunders committed in the name=\r\n of promoting science. Humanity is in a grave danger. Environment being des=\r\ntroyed, arms race growing, every day every person has to learn new stuff to=\r\n keep him upgraded. A well learned(so-called) man in modern times soon gets=\r\n outdated as science gets &#39;updated&#39;. Is it not true that when no of people =\r\nwho need to upgrade themselves have increased? Which only means there are a=\r\n lot more people &#39;ignorant&#39; and level of ignorance , in the name of science=\r\n, technology and knowledge , keeps increasing.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\nIf emails are order of the day, some futuristic multimedia, pda based virtu=\r\nal world networking could be the order of tomorrow. May be in next year or =\r\ntwo. No cyber laws. But lots of cyber crime!! &nbsp;Seems that there is onl=\r\ny more chaos than order.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;I am neither cynical, =\r\nnor would like to be. I also use emails and network in forums. WHat I have =\r\nseen and observed is what I have shared.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;I=\r\n would now like to share something that struck me to be very profound.&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Vedas, Shastras, Ayurveda and any Rshi proktam is th=\r\ne Truth. Unchanging with time, age, person and place. No revisions. No vers=\r\nion 1.0 or 2.0. &nbsp;Because Rshi proktam is The Truth. Rshi is a Drshta a=\r\n &#39;seer&#39; who see the Truth as is. Can there be a better scientist? Today&#39;s s=\r\ncientist needs a most complex lab with lost of instruments to measure accur=\r\nately and follow laws, formulae etc. Any error is very costly. Governments =\r\nwill apologise and easily get away by giving drugs which cause side-effects=\r\n. Rshis have no take away from this world. They are unattached and are mani=\r\nfestation of Love and Truth. Realized and Divine. What they give is for ben=\r\nefit of humanity and is purely selfless.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;When I=\r\n realized the above fact, that&#39;s when it dawned on me as to how many people=\r\n are blindly wooed by the attractive science in a short term and pledge the=\r\nir souls to science, technology, fame and money.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div=\r\n&gt;DO we have enough time in one lifetime to go with ever-evolving science an=\r\nd technology to gather the right &#39;knowledge&#39; ?
