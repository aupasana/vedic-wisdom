But you are going to the other extreme when suggesting t=\r\nhat physical immortality is the highest ideal. Neither viewpoint is correct=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ignoring the views of a s=\r\ntereotypical psudo-vedantin of today, we can see that vedanta in fact does =\r\nnot say physical body is to be ignored. It asks us *realize* that we are no=\r\nt the physical body and we are something else residing in a shell called th=\r\ne physical body. What we truly are, can neither be created nor be destroyed=\r\n, though physical body may perish. But, if someone currently thinks that on=\r\ne is a physical body, one cannot simply ignore the physical body. One has t=\r\no *use* the physical body to eventually realize that one is not the physica=\r\nl body. A mere intellectual statement of it is not tantamount to its realiz=\r\nation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In Yoga Vaasishtham,=\r\n Maharshi Vasishtha clearly says that action (karma) and knowledge (jnaana)=\r\n are two wings with which the bird of individualized consciousness flies in=\r\nto the sky of self-realization. Physical body is not to be ignored, but to =\r\nbe used skillfully and carefully to perform the *right actions* that can fr=\r\nee one.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As I said earlier, one performing actions without cor=\r\nrect knowledge (that god is the doer of all actions!) is like a person who =\r\nis walking around a mountain not realizing that the goal of walking is to r=\r\neach the top. Such a person will keep walking forever and not reach the top=\r\n. On the other hand, one having the correct knowledge but not performing ac=\r\ntions is like someone who knows that reaching the top of the mountain is th=\r\ne goal and keeps staring at the top, without walking. Such a person will re=\r\nmain at the base of the mountain. Thus, jnaana and karma alone are not able=\r\n to free one and that is why Vasishtha compares them to two wings of a bird=\r\n. The equilibrium caused by action and knowledge is what takes us towards l=\r\niberation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Physical bodies =\r\nof some siddhas may indeed remain intact for a long time, like centuries or=\r\n millennia. But, eventually, they too may give up physical body. Someone me=\r\nntioned Vallalar, but he gave up physical body, didn&#39;t he?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ac=\r\ntually, to a truly liberated siddha, this discussion of physical immortalit=\r\ny will sound silly. Self is uncreated and indestructible, but its modificat=\r\nions such as physical forms can be born and be destroyed at will really. A =\r\nsiddha, as long as one does not merge in Brahman completely, can remain in =\r\nan individualized *ethereal* body with a subtle ego, even after giving up a=\r\n physical body. One can then create a physical body at will, then merge bac=\r\nk in the ethereal body after a few decades or centuries or millennia and so=\r\n on. So, what is the whole point of physical immortality?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tri=\r\nlinga Swami (aka Telang Swami) of Kashi was a perfected Siddha. He was a gu=\r\nru-bhai of Vimalananda. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa commented during a visit to=\r\n Varanasi that Trilinga Swami was Shiva himself. Bhairavi Brahmani who came=\r\n to Dakshineshwar and taught Tantra to Ramakrishna was in the lineage of Tr=\r\nilinga Swami. Later, a grateful Ramakrishna revisited Kashi and fed Triling=\r\na Swami a big container full of rice pudding with his own hands! During his=\r\n imprisonment by the British (for walking naked in Kashi), he was seen by s=\r\nome guards to be in his cell and also walking on the prison compound wall a=\r\nt the same time. Even when he finally decided to give up his body and his d=\r\nisciples put his body in a container and threw it into Ganges, he was seen =\r\nafter a few minutes to walk on the other side.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; To a realized =\r\nbeing with a high enough command over duality, creation and destruction of =\r\nphysical body is not a big deal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One who thinks that a gold c=\r\noin is special and needs to be preserved forever will struggle to do so. On=\r\ne who realizes that a gold coin, a gold chain, a gold ring, a golden arrow =\r\netc are all basically the same (gold) can melt the coin and recreate it aga=\r\nin. Preserving the coin forever is an irrelevant goal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *     =\r\n   *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The key point is this. Trilinga Swami did not g=\r\net those abilities because he wanted them or did a sadhana for them specifi=\r\ncally.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The same non-dual Self fills us all. Whether X realize=\r\ns non-dual Self or Y realizes non-dual Self, the realization is the same. B=\r\nut, if one retains individual ego-consciousness and interacts with the fiel=\r\nd of duality, different possibilities are there. One may engage in various =\r\nactions using a physical body and at the end drop the ego-consciousness and=\r\n merge in Brahman. Or, one may engage in various actions using a physical b=\r\nody, then give it up and tie the ego-consciousness to an ethereal body and =\r\nremain in a higher realm for a long time. If so, one may re-enter a physica=\r\nl body from time to time. But, all this is governed by one&#39;s caliber and ev=\r\nolution in the field of duality. Though, all are the same at the non-dual l=\r\nevel, different beings have different caliber in the field of duality. A ri=\r\nshi or Vishnu or a siddha or a natha may not be the same as somebody else.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I like Aurobindo, but I am =\r\nafraid he lent himself vulnerable to misinterpretation when it comes to div=\r\ninization of matter. I say quite emphatically that physical immortality as =\r\nan ideal and as the end goal of one&#39;s sadhana is a dangerous idea.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The only worthy goal is to efface individual ego, realize Self and, i=\r\nf needed, engage with the world with a subtle ego and do whatever comes spo=\r\nntaneously. Once heavier conditioning is overcome, Nature starts to show on=\r\ne the role one has to play. One should just play the role given to one well=\r\n, instead of asking for this role or that role.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotis=\r\nh Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri=\r\n Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;     =\r\n Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt; &gt; &gt;      Spirit=\r\nuality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Jyotish writings=\r\n: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- silentadm=\r\nirer_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaskar,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The aim of my =\r\nmails is only to free the minds of the reader from biases, caused by domina=\r\nting propaganda of Vedantists - that is to see the Physical body as somethi=\r\nng to be ignored for spiritual pursuit.

On the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; contrary in the section where Babaji and his sister (who lives in s=\r\namadhi under\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the dasasamedha ghata in Kasi) meet Lahiri Mahasaya,=\r\n Babaji states that he is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the only one who would be remaining in =\r\nphysical body till the end, no one else.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Neither is this=C3=82 to=\r\n be set as an=C3=82 achieveable target of spiritual progress, or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nelse Lahiri Mahasaya and Babaji would have mentioned the same clearly.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vedic method, worshipping the devatas, allows for immortali=\r\nty, through Soma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; devata.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why did not =\r\nthe Rishis of yore or even Krishna, attain physical immortality till\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; end of the cycle of creation? Because if one is immortal in the physica=\r\nl body,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one must survive in it till the end of creation. Anything=\r\n less is not exactly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physical immortality, but only living as lon=\r\ng as it is necessary for one to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; live.

What I have tried to state so far, w.r.t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;S=\r\nuccess with Mantra&quot; topic, is that No matter how hard one tries, Ravanas&#39; o=\r\nr\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Ramas&#39; achievements in the field of &quot;duality&quot; cannot be erased=\r\n by any amount of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Highest shakti&quot; with or without Ego.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Reason lies in what Aurobindo states as Sat=\r\n-chid-ananda as the basis of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;all planes of existence including P=\r\nhysical plane of existence. Argument of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Impermanence by Advaitin=\r\ns has not so far been able to erase the world of duality\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;from ex=\r\nistence. As per Aurobindo, Ananda is the basis of sense-mind, Chit is the\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;basis of Physical consciousness, and Sat is the basis of existenc=\r\ne of Physical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;plane, so lets not argue that there is another rea=\r\nlity which is better and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;happier than this one, and that this wo=\r\nrld is a myth. If physical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;sense-experience is fleeting, it is b=\r\necause one has not progressed enough to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;realize why the truth of=\r\n being is expressed in such a way at this plane of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;existence ?\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomline is Sense-experience is not different from Ana=\r\nnda, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Physical body not different from Chit.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high level of ability to manipulate objects i=\r\nn the field of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;duality,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cannot compete=\r\n with perfect self-control and egolessness.

Compete with lower sha=\r\nkti ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This question was asked because you were trying t=\r\no compare apples with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;oranges, by saying that (egolessness) soul=\r\n consciousness competes with ego\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;consciousness, presuming that t=\r\nhey act upon each other.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Truth of t=\r\nhe matter is that Soul is not in competition with ego\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;consciousn=\r\ness ever, because God is never in competition with his creation !! If\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;a liberated soul wants to take part in an ego competition (Yada Yada =\r\nhee\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Dharmasya), it has to have an ego, however high, like that o=\r\nf an avatar. Krishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;took the wheel of the chariot and tried to =\r\nkill Bhishma, not without an ego.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Other people may differ with m=\r\ne on this.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I see inconsistencies =\r\nin your views and a biased and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OTOH, I see a lot of con=\r\nsistency in this mail exchange than the last\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;time.

Because one is pursuing happiness of some kind or the other=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;But the happiness one gets when one achieves something in the =\r\nfield of duality\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is not permanent.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The highest shakti gives the highest bliss, i.e. sat-chid-an=\r\nanda,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;which is permanent.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When one is pursuing an individual will, one may be swimming with or\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;against the divine will. One will have some successes and some f=\r\nailures, some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;pleasures and some pains. When one&#39;s individual wi=\r\nll has dropped off and one is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;flowing with the rhythm of the div=\r\nine will, one is in bliss no matter what one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;does. One *can* do =\r\nanything, but one does only what divine rhythm wills done by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;one=\r\n!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Only the fully detached Shiva=\r\n can beget Shakti in totality and demons\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;like Ravana or Mahisha =\r\nor Shumbha can only get some trappings of Shakti but can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;never b=\r\neget Shakti in totality.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A demo=\r\nn like Hiranyakashipu or Ravana may kill or imprison a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;self-real=\r\nized rishi. It may seem like the demon has more shakti. But the rishi\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;is in bliss whether he is alive or being killed, whether he is at his=\r\n hermitage\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;or in prison. The happiness demons got from their suc=\r\ncesses were short-lived and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ended later. But the rishi was in co=\r\nnstant bliss. So the rishi&#39;s shakti was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;superior.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why then fight like mortals, taking help fr=\r\nom mortal allies ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Instead, just order Rudra to fin=\r\nish the life of all ones&#39; enemies\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is the thing with shakti. Shakti is the ability to do t=\r\nhings in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the field of duality. Just as you do not give important=\r\n work to irresponsible\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;people, any level of shakti never goes to=\r\n people who do not know how to handle\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that level of shakti.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, if a rishi wanted, he could&#39;ve=\r\n summoned Rudra to finish off\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Ravana or Hiranyakashipu. But, a r=\r\nishi is in bliss no matter what and does not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;break divine rhythm=\r\n. If Sita, Rama and Hanuman have to come to earth and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;establish =\r\ncertain lessons for future and take care of Ravana, a rishi will let\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;that happen and not do anything hasty.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and P=\r\nitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyotis=\r\nhWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- silentadmi=\r\nrer_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaskar,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lord Rama defeated and killed Ra=\r\nvana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Killing Ravana was not a great deed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ravana had done that 10 times himself, beheading his own he=\r\nad, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the shakti of his sadhana was such that he got a new hea=\r\nd every time to continue\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the sadhana. On a deeper level, it is R=\r\nudra that finally effects the death of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Physical consciousness, s=\r\no even that part is not in the hands of a mortal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Physical form.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you still put Ravana a=\r\nbove Rama in shakti, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question your understandin=\r\ng of what &quot;shakti&quot; is.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On a mundane level, Shakti i=\r\ns Memory. Hanumaan realized his shakti\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;only after he was reminde=\r\nd of it. Karna, in the final battle, forgot his Shastra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;vidya be=\r\ncause of the curse of his Guru. Generalizing, Shakti is the ability to\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;remember the series of actions to be done to effect a cause lawfully=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;irrespective of the doer. Thus, Hanumaan had perfect memory by=\r\n birth, and not by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the association with Rama. Ravana didn&#39;t have=\r\n perfect memory, else he would have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;attempted to kill Vibhishana=\r\n sooner than later.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The use=\r\n of shakti against avatar, binding the physical body of both\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Ram=\r\n and Lakshman, by a mortal (Meghnaad) was a great deed, because even the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;motherly love of Yashoda couldn&#39;t bind Krishna avatar by a rope. M=\r\neghnaad was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;son of Ravana. If it were not for Hanumaan, and Garu=\r\nda using divine powers, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;result would have been different.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Despite all, without Vibhisha=\r\nna revealing the secrets, it was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;impossible to kill Ravana.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even a high level of understa=\r\nnding of the field of duality and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;even &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; high level of ability to manipulate objects in the field of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;duality,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cannot compete with perfect self-contro=\r\nl and egolessness. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; latter represents the high=\r\nest shakti and Lord Rama had it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What does the &quot;highest shakti&quot; do ?
