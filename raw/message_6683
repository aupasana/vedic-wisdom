But I want t=\r\no tell you that I hate God because one part of my brain always tells me fro=\r\nm behind to go to a certain temple on accomplishing some task.And then I co=\r\nunter that thought saying that I will not go to temple even if my work gets=\r\n done. This way whole of my energy is exhausted in getting these obsessive =\r\nthoughts and countering them. I hate god because he forces me to do so.I wa=\r\ns a very religious girl even since by childhood.\nBut now I cant see him.\nTh=\r\nanks\nAS\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, viswa raghava &lt;raghavaviswanathkrishna@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I did not understand your problem. Is that your problem with g=\r\noing to temple or hating the god. It doesn&#39;t mean you love god if you go to=\r\n temple or you hate him if you don&#39;t.=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; There are types of Bhakthis o=\r\nr prayers humans offer to god. Yours is the most beautiful kind of prayer. =\r\npraying the god out of fear and hatred.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are people who did the s=\r\name, say for example Ravana, Hiranyakasyapa. Marrecha from Ramayana has als=\r\no same kind of problem. Interesting part is GOD didn&#39;t do any thing to them=\r\n until they crossed their limits.\n&gt; \n&gt; They all hate the god. Just believe =\r\nin one thing, when it comes to god. What ever you feel about GOD. it doesn&#39;=\r\nt change how god sees you.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you can not see you in the form he is in=\r\n temples, See him in the form you like. For example, if you like parents st=\r\nart praying to them daily imagining them as God you want to pray.=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\nf I have to go in details, If you want to pray to Siva today, Start seeing =\r\nyou father as Shiva and start seeing you mother as parvathi.=A0\n&gt; I do the =\r\nsame, I pray Lord Lakshmi Devi who looks exactly like mother.=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; you d=\r\nont have to feel wrong for hating god. The more you hate the god the more y=\r\nou become close to god. you dont believe me. There are three stories in pur=\r\nanas which say that Lord Vishnu mentions the same fact.\n&gt; \n&gt; I apologies if=\r\n I have mentioned any thing wrong and hope this helps you\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Vis=\r\nwanath\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
