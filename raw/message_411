It =\r\nwas a \nlong distance and he knew that I cherish metaphysical discussions; h=\r\ne \ntook that opportunity and started some related topic. We came finally \nt=\r\no discussion *Non-vegetarian food*. He asked me as to what is the \nreason o=\r\nf my being a pure vegetarian eater. Was it something due to \nreligious doct=\r\nrine? I tried to explain him various things such as our \ncultural backgroun=\r\nd, tradition of my fore fathers based on religious \ninstructions and such r=\r\nesponsible facts. As he wanted to press me \nmore on that, he asked me about=\r\n my personal thinking and likings on \nthe issue. I couldn=A1=A6t hold back =\r\nmyself and honestly explained my \nconclusive view point on the whole subjec=\r\nt as follow\n=A1=A7I don=A1=A6t wish to stuff my stomach with the body parts=\r\n of killed \ncreature. Would never think of troubling any leaving creature w=\r\nhen \nmother-nature has provided enough alternate food. Just for the sake \no=\r\nf filling my stomach or satisfying cravings of my tongue, I won=A1=A6t be \n=\r\nresponsible for killing innocent birds, animals, fishes directly or \nindire=\r\nctly. What right I have, to snatch away even a single life in \nthe universe=\r\n for my selfish reasons. I consider that as very very \ncruel and that is th=\r\ne personal thinking why I am a vegetarian and not \nstrictly due to any reli=\r\ngious or cultural reason=A1=A8\n\nThe above was a harsh truth for anybody and=\r\n there was no reply or \nargument to this. My colleague didn=A1=A6t say anyt=\r\nhing after that but the \npoint was conveyed though through a biting fact.\n\n=\r\nI=A1=A6ve observed lot of people, talked to many who are Hindu culture and =\r\n\neating frequently meat and fish. The idea of leaving non-veg food \nseems a=\r\n distant possibility for them. They can restrain themselves on \nsome select=\r\ned weekdays but not leaving it altogether. Even when they \nknow in their he=\r\narts of hearts about that it=A1=A6s a bad karma. Almost \nall of them confes=\r\nsed to me that the TASTE of non-veg food is \nunsurpassable. They can not re=\r\nmain without it for long time.  If this \nis the condition of the people fro=\r\nm sanatan-dharma, it is too much to \nput through this view point with our b=\r\nrothers and sisters from \ndifferent faiths, who were born and groomed eatin=\r\ng the non-veg food  \n\nHere I don=A1=A6t wish to offend any of the members. =\r\nI have no \nprejudice/disliking against the people who eat meat. Infact, I e=\r\nat my \nvegetarian (Gaas-patte =83=BA) food sitting on the same table with m=\r\ny \ncolleagues where they enjoy theirs. We even share the *veg part* of \nit.=\r\n They are all my very good friends.\n\nBUT many a times it pains me that they=\r\n are getting knowingly or \nunknowingly in to unending chain of Karmas. Some=\r\n of them are \nspiritually inclined and I pray that only if they leave non-v=\r\neg, how \nmuch good they=A1=A6ll do for themselves.\n\nBut am I wrong in think=\r\ning this way? Am I wrong in my efforts to make \nthem understand my view poi=\r\nnt? Though I never pressurize or irritate \nanybody on the issue. \nSome time=\r\ns I feel that if most of the humans on earth eat meat, fish \nand eggs then =\r\nis there any fundamental misconception about it? can \nthere be so many peop=\r\nle wrong in their food habits. But in any case, \nfor me I=A1=A6ll stick to =\r\nveg food simply because the logic I gave to my \nGerman colleague.\n\nI wish i=\r\nf somebody can really though light of knowledge on the whole \nissue for wha=\r\nt is right and what is not and especially considering \nspiritual destinatio=\r\nn as well as world peace. If so many helpless \ncreatures are butchered ever=\r\nyday for craving of taste, how then it is \npossible for the human beings to=\r\n ever live in peace. Will never be. I \nrecollect our Magnanimous, all compa=\r\nssionate prayer which says =A1=A7SARVE \nbhavantu Sukhinah..=A1=A8 not only =\r\nHumans but *Sarve* , all the lives.  \n\nBest Regards,\nUtpal\n\n\n\n"}}
