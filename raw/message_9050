I&#39;ve enjoyed reading them.\n\nKbkm-ji, I really like your suggestion o=\r\nf 10 minutes of prayer for the health of others before going to bed. What a=\r\n lovely idea- I strongly feel that this would be a great help, especially i=\r\nf we do it in great numbers. It is good to pray for individuals and also ex=\r\ntend the prayer for all beings and all creation.\n\nWhat better way of develo=\r\nping Bhakti than prayer for the welfare of all beings, including &#39;friends&#39;,=\r\n &#39;enemies&#39;  and strangers.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nAparna\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, KBKM &lt;kbk_murthi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; This is an important issue to=\r\n be aware of by any aspirant. As informed by sisters Aparna and Leela Sastr=\r\ny, I also know one case, where a lady from Chennai experienced adverse effe=\r\ncts of such exercises called as Pranayama and  Yoga in various centers. She=\r\n failed to get sleep inspire of heavy doses of sedatives. I contacted her, =\r\nonly from this Vedic - Wisdom group long back, and  tried to counsel her fo=\r\nr remedial measures. With many household responsibilities, her life became =\r\nhorrible, with out sleep,and with heavy medication sleeping at the early ho=\r\nurs after late night and failing to discharge her duties in the morning to =\r\nher husband and school going children.\n&gt; \n&gt; The point is not to criticizes =\r\nany school of Yoga. If a Master trains his disciples in any yogic phenomena=\r\n, he should take responsibility to also show remedial measures. It is so ha=\r\nppening that, out of enthusiasm ,many are suggesting many methods of Pranay=\r\nama. Yoga,herbal remedies or Mantras with out full-pledged expertise in it.=\r\n\n&gt;  So aspirants please be aware to practice anything only from a Master, a=\r\nnd not middle knowledged persons. If any adverse reaction occures, a Master=\r\n should be able to rectify and save the followers. \n&gt; \n&gt; Beware of the adve=\r\nrse effects of everything medicines,healing procedures,natural alternative =\r\nmedicines, massages, teachings called yoga. Best thing as suggested by the =\r\ntwo sisters is Dedication, Submission, Selflessness , charity, more applica=\r\ntions giving and not in receiving from others. Love and help all through li=\r\nfe. One should realize the Narayana in all and serve them heart fully. Do n=\r\not go on acquiring,but keep offering. Be streamlines I daily routine, to ge=\r\nt a rhythm. Do not forget the SUN GOD who is appearing everyday. All energy=\r\n is received fromSun. \n&gt; \n&gt; If we just follow some of such principles, ther=\r\ne will be a chemistry happening  in the body resulting in transformation an=\r\nd transmutation of  cells.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let us pray everyday before going to bed fo=\r\nr 10 min to ask for healing to all suffering ones. Whenever you come into c=\r\nontact anyone through out the day, immediately note down the name, age, suf=\r\nfering of the person in a diary immediately. Everyday at bed time pray for =\r\nall such persons you have noted. Continue for each sufferer prayer for thre=\r\ne consecutive days in the night and delete the name. Like this one can help=\r\n many sufferers to get healing.\n&gt; \n&gt; With love and best wishes\n&gt; bro. kBKM\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Sent from my iPad, \n&gt; \n&gt; On Feb 28, 2013, at 2:10 PM, Leela Sastry &lt;le=\r\nela.sastry@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Dear   AParna ,\n&gt; &gt; yes  , Kundalini  Awake=\r\nning is very dangerous if it does not take place properly . If the sadhaka =\r\nis not protected by his or her manthra devatha ,it could play havoc.   we a=\r\nll know the experience of Gopi krishna .Had he had a manthra perhaps he mig=\r\nht not have undergone that much of suffering .

Actually personally I feel most of the cases ending up in  the  mental=\r\n asylums  are kundalini   failures only . Many   times the experiences   na=\r\nrrated by them resemble closely  the   experiences of kundalini sadhakas . =\r\n  of   all  the margas , bhakthi  marga is the best in the sense it is very=\r\n safe and easy as the person is under the protection of Ishtadevatha .

This has involved out-of-body experie=\r\nnces and surges of energy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had =\r\nnever heard of kundalini until her symptoms started and she searched for an=\r\n explanation. We have not been able to find anything physically wrong with =\r\nher (all tests normal)- so it might be that this is due to deranged kundali=\r\nni. Many people we call mentally ill describe themselves as having a spirit=\r\nual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered=\r\n interest and research into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunat=\r\nely these patients are not well-understood by western medicine, and as we h=\r\nave no treatments for deranged kundalini, we struggle to help them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My experience with this l=\r\nady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. Thi=\r\ns woman wants to kill herself at times because the suffering from the deran=\r\nged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her, and it is something sh=\r\ne cannot escape from.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I wondered what solution there could be to h=\r\ner problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests=\r\n as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and either cure h=\r\ner, or give her the strength to bear this. May I request that the good sama=\r\nritans among you pray for her, and for others like her (whom we may not kno=\r\nw of)- their suffering really is pitiable. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And let us be careful =\r\nin our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps thi=\r\ns is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say &quot;let m=\r\ne be your instrument&quot; and leave the kundalini rising bit to God&#39;s will.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Om Dum Durgayai Namaha\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Aparna \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
