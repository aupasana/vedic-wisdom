You can add ghee/coconut pieces any time, e=\r\nven if you are not saying Swaha.\n&gt; &gt; 2) Can i add ghee after i do purnahuti=\r\n because then i will be sure that it will get burned , otherwise some piece=\r\ns remain.\n&gt; Vijay: Yes. No problem. BTW, if any pieces are not burnt fully,=\r\n do not bother about them. It is alright. Imagine as if you were serving th=\r\ne guess with some sweets. You will like if they eat them fully but, if they=\r\n leave some amount you wouldn&#39;t mind right? Leaving some does not mean your=\r\n guess did not appreciate your gesture.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3) Does it matter how i keep=\r\n that piece of coconut , which i kept in the kund for PURNAHUTI, i mean ,th=\r\ne part6 thats cut upside or towards down. Hope this question is clear.\n&gt; Vi=\r\njay: No, it does not matter. If you keep the dark color up, it burns longer=\r\n easily. Other than convenience how you keep does not really matter much. H=\r\now ever, try to imagine the purnahuti is your own igo/identification.
