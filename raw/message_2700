It seems to be his extrapolation.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; What you quoted from Taittariya Upanishad is the traditional v=\r\niew that I am familiar with. Other scriptures refer to the same order of cr=\r\neation, including &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot;, where Maharshi Vasishtha teaches crea=\r\ntion, destruction and liberation to Lord Rama.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *    =\r\n    *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This Upanishadic understanding is also consistent with =\r\nchakra based understanding of Tantra. The five chakras downwards from Visud=\r\ndhi chakra to Moolaadhaara chakra represent ether, air, fire, water and ear=\r\nth. When Kundalini leaves Moolaadhaara, earth element within one is surrend=\r\nered, i.e. all traces of earth element are effaced in one&#39;s self-awareness.=\r\n When Kundalini leaves Swaadhishthaana, water element within one is surrend=\r\nered, i.e. all traces of water element are effaced in one&#39;s self-awareness.=\r\n And so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; By earth and water etc, don&#39;t just think of physi=\r\ncal earth and physical water etc. Earth element shows a solid state of exis=\r\ntence. Water element shows a flexible and fluid state of existence. For exa=\r\nmple, an idea that one &quot;owns&quot; a particular thing (e.g. a car, a house, spou=\r\nse, some knowledge etc) is of solid state and made of earth element. An ide=\r\na that one &quot;needs&quot; a particular thing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some kn=\r\nowledge etc) is of the nature of water element. Thus, different mental conc=\r\nepts and ideas can be mapped to the five elements.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When one t=\r\nhinks of &quot;I&quot;, one perhaps thinks of a body that looks and feels in a partic=\r\nular way physically. Apart from the physical aspect, one may think of &quot;I&quot; a=\r\ns someone who has certain qualities, certain needs, certain belongings etc.=\r\n All those concepts one has about who one is, form one&#39;s self-awareness and=\r\n Kundalini represents that self-awareness. Kundalini cannot leave Moolaadha=\r\nara chakra, if *anything* that is *solid* in nature within one&#39;s cumulative=\r\n idea of who one is is still remaining. Kundalini cannot leave Swaadhishtha=\r\nana chakra, if *anything* that is *solid* or *fluid* in nature within one&#39;s=\r\n cumulative idea of who one is is still remaining. And so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Many people who talk about experiences of Kundalini in higher chakras are =\r\noften talking merely about some amount of vaayus flowing in those chakras (=\r\nwhich may still be a nice experience) and have *not* experienced Kundalini =\r\nactually being there. IF Kundalini really leaves Moolaadhaara, one will not=\r\n perceive a solid body, one will not have notions of owning anything. Simil=\r\narly, as Kundalini moves up each chakra, each element is effaced in one&#39;s c=\r\numulative idea of who one is, at the physical as well as the subtle level o=\r\nf existence! To completely efface even one element (earth) from one&#39;s notio=\r\nn of self (&quot;I&quot;), even for a short duration of time, is not at all easy.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The order in which elements are effaced as one progresses toward=\r\ns samadhi is - earth, water, fire, air and ether. If Kundalini again comes =\r\ndown, effaced elements return to work in the reverse order - ether, air, fi=\r\nre, water and earth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regard=\r\ning physics and spiritual realities:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does physics describe =\r\nreality?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Physics tries to describe/model reality at the gross=\r\n physical level, as perceived by the external senses. However, one&#39;s mind c=\r\nan &quot;perceive&quot; things without the external senses playing a role.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; As a simple example, one may be asleep and get a dream, in which one&#39;s =\r\nmind may &quot;see&quot; some people and &quot;hear&quot; a conversation between them. In anoth=\r\ner example, a yogi may be meditating with a mantra with intense focus and &quot;=\r\nsee&quot; some scenes and/or &quot;hear&quot; some things. These things cannot be perceive=\r\nd by the external senses and hence cannot be studied by modern science.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is reasonable to define reality as something that can be perc=\r\neived by the external senses, because different people can experience the s=\r\name reality using their senses individually and verify the observation. How=\r\never, some experiences of the mind that cannot be perceived by senses are s=\r\nometimes very powerful and have a huge, life-altering and sometimes liberat=\r\ning influence on people. Inability to study and model them is a big drawbac=\r\nk of modern science.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One ma=\r\ny categorize dreams and internal yogic experiences as imaginations or hallu=\r\ncinations, because there is no independent validation, and call them unwort=\r\nhy of a study. But there are cases that make one wonder. For example, see t=\r\nhe following messages from the archives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mystical experiences=\r\n of mind and mantras (message 951)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedi=\r\nc-wisdom/message/951\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message, one person had a s=\r\npecific yogic experience that was described in detail and another person se=\r\nemed to know about it and supplied one tangible detail relating to the expe=\r\nrience, suggesting that he too &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the first perso=\r\nn, though it was beyond the external senses of either person!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Re: Guru (message 391)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/me=\r\nssage/391\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message also, one person had a specifi=\r\nc yogic experience that was described in detail and another person seemed t=\r\no know about it and supplied a couple of tangible details relating to the e=\r\nxperience, suggesting that he too &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the first pe=\r\nrson, though it was beyond the external senses of either person!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Internal god and external god (message 2498)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/vedic-wisdom/message/2498\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message, one=\r\n person had a specific yogic experience involving a deity and another perso=\r\nn perceived with his external senses a vision involving the same deity, tho=\r\nugh others in the room could not perceive anything with their external sens=\r\nes, suggesting that the second person &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the firs=\r\nt person through a specific prism.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Such examples cannot prove much, but they do suggest that perhaps *=\r\nsome* experiences that cannot be measured or perceived by the external sens=\r\nes are observable by others, though not everyone may be able to observe. Th=\r\nen, one cannot rule out the possibility of *some* experiences that cannot b=\r\ne measured or perceived by the external senses being a part of the &quot;reality=\r\n&quot; that mind can access.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But, how can modern science study it?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Because the only thing that can be studied and measured is t=\r\nhe reality involving the gross body and its senses, one may suggest that ex=\r\nperiences of the subtle body may be studied by observing various parts of t=\r\nhe gross physical body. For example, one can look at the nervous signals fl=\r\nowing through various parts of the brain and try to correlate them with the=\r\n experiences of the subtle body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; On the surface, it sounds li=\r\nke a great idea. But, it assumes that subtle body and causal body are redun=\r\ndant. Though there is some correspondence between what happens in the causa=\r\nl, subtle and gross bodies, it is a many-to-many mapping and NOT a one-to-o=\r\nne mapping, in which case the concept of causal and subtle bodies would be =\r\nredundant, i.e. whatever they model can be moderled using just the gross bo=\r\ndy!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you drive through a neighborhood and observe the house=\r\ns from the road, you can have *some* idea of what is going on. A particular=\r\n house with a lot of lights and sound and many cars parked outside may be h=\r\naving a party. People in one particular house with no lights are probably o=\r\nut of town. But you can never be sure what is going on in the house, how ma=\r\nny people are inside, what exactly they are doing etc, by merely looking at=\r\n the house from outside.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, by looking at the nervous=\r\n signals in various points of the brain, you may be able to see some basic =\r\nthings, but not much. The experiences of the subtle mind are beyond your re=\r\nach and study, if your tools are limited to the gross physical domain.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, modern science c=\r\nannot study that part of the reality which is beyond the scope of external =\r\nsenses, unless scientists become yogis and develop mastery of the internal =\r\nworld.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; While rishis of ancient times had mastery of the inter=\r\nnal world (which is the microcosm of the entire universe) and could observe=\r\n any space-time point, even the greatest yogis of today cannot control thei=\r\nr state completely. When Kundalini rises, it may go somewhere and one may e=\r\nxperience some part of the Infinite Reality. But one cannot control exactly=\r\n where Kundalini goes and exactly which part of the Infinite Reality one ob=\r\nserves. Rishis seemed to have a perfect control.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer=\r\n.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Fre=\r\ne Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jaga=\r\nnnath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- ra=\r\njarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry the previous mail went off=\r\n incomplete. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sundeep,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me ment=\r\nion some stuff from the diaries of Sri Shamacharun Lahiri (a self realized =\r\nYogi of the highest order) - it maybe of some help to you.

Then from there =\r\ncame the &quot;vidhyut&quot; of Akash. As this &quot;Vidyut&quot; interacted with the chaos, it=\r\n produced some universal energies which are more commonly known as the univ=\r\nersal deities like Shiva, Vishnu etc etc. Then came the &quot;Vidyut&quot; of vayu ( =\r\nnone of these are the actual physical elements as we see it, but more the e=\r\nssence of the element, hence his use of the word &quot;vidyut&quot; and &quot; taranga&quot;) w=\r\nhose interaction with the chaos resulted in some more energy states. Thus, =\r\nin this way came, Agni, Apa and Prithwi, each one resulting from the previo=\r\nus and each one resulting in some energy states, which in the end resulted =\r\nin 33 crore possible states of energy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is some less=\r\non in there (at least for me), and I want to get at it.. I feel there may b=\r\ne some correlation between that and the 11-dimensional physics of super str=\r\ning theory too, but I get ahead of myself..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is a nic=\r\ne idea and I would like to know more about it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As much as=\r\n I could fathom (I am no physicist, neither do I have the ability to penetr=\r\nate the mathematics of the M-Theory), as it stands now, it is quite half fo=\r\nrmed. There being multiple theories of the String variety, adhered to by mu=\r\nltiple physicists, the M-Theory (11 dimensional one) is one of the many whi=\r\nch &#39;claim to explain&#39; in parts some aspects of the physical world. Finding =\r\na correlation between this and the idea of the five elements, in my humble =\r\nopinion, is still far fetched. I can understand some correlation between ba=\r\nsic Quantum Mechanics, (at least the Copenhegan Interpretation), non-locali=\r\nty etc, and the ideas of Indian mysticism, but a link between M-theory of p=\r\nanch-mahabhuta?!..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, with the kind permission of Nara=\r\nsimha, I would like to know more about how exactly you can link these two, =\r\nbecause I myself with my limited understand fail to see any viable correlat=\r\nion at all as of now, specially, since the M-theory is yet in a very nascen=\r\nt stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The other thing one must think about is the basi=\r\nc nature of theoritical physics. Does physics describe reality? Or does it =\r\nprovide a model of reality? These two are different. Mathematics provides a=\r\n tool/model to gauge reality. It need not be exactly as reality is. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Which is why Richard Feynman once famously quoted that everyone knows tha=\r\nt Quatum Mechanics works, but no one know what it really is!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; The idea of the pach mahabhuta and creation is almost the essence of ev=\r\nerything. The day physics gets THAT deep, there would be really nothing  mo=\r\nre left to do. Physics is still quite far away from that stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 29/9/09, ve=\r\ndicastrostudent &lt;vedicastrostudent@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not sure if I get the thrust of your point.

I feel there may be some=\r\n correlation between that and the 11-dimensional physics of super string th=\r\neory too, but I get ahead of myself..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sundeep\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, rajar=\r\nshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sundeep,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With all due respect to your query, I wanted to ask, how doe=\r\ns it matter? Can anyone here really know for sure which came after which? W=\r\ne can only speculate and guess and retrofit logic and quote one scripture v=\r\ns another scripture. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Only practical way to really fin=\r\nd out the truth is sadhana.

I have heard dif=\r\nfering opinions though, perhaps in Sanjay Rathji&#39;s Brhat Nakshtra but since=\r\n I dont have the book in front of me, I cant confirm. Do you agree with the=\r\n interpretation above, if not what is your belief, source and justification=\r\n?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sundeep\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
