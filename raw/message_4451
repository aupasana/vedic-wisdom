The problem is not with Jyotish as a subjec=\r\nt. The problem is with Jyotishis. Their knowledge is imperfect. Based on su=\r\nch imperfect knowledge when people recommend gemstones etc, they may or may=\r\n not work out.\n=C2=A0\nBut if we look at it from another point of view, ever=\r\ny affliction - mental/phsyical/spiritual -=C2=A0is finally a karmic reactio=\r\nn. And when one does sadhana, one is basically trying hard to finsh off his=\r\n storehouse of karmas. Finally God realization is about finsh off the karma=\r\ns which block progress. Instead of putting faith on imperfect jyotishis, on=\r\ne is much better off putting his/her faith on a deity whose sadhana he/she =\r\nis doing and the deity will guide the person correctly in what needs to be =\r\ndone. So in that sense, when one plunges into serious sadhana, the person d=\r\noes not feel like consulting jyotishis or checking out charts. The perspect=\r\nive about life changes. I once made a collection of charts of people who we=\r\nre good, genuine sadhakas, with some amount of spiritual progress. Some wer=\r\ne famous, some not famous. When I showed these charts to different jyotishi=\r\ns asking them about what is the most defining characteristics of this indiv=\r\nidual, they came up\n with all sorts of weird answers which were anything bu=\r\nt true. Once a=C2=A0jyotishi knows that the chart belongs to a genuinely sp=\r\niritual person,=C2=A0he can smoothly back engineer many combinations and pr=\r\nove his point. But if no clue is provided, he mostlty fails, specially when=\r\n juding spiritual charts. This could well be because when a sadhaka does sa=\r\ndhana, he burns off karmas, thus a completely=C2=A0new frequency of analysi=\r\ns is needed. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nIn my view, the ability to predict the future h=\r\nas nothing to do with knowledge of Jyotish scriptures/shastras. It comes fr=\r\nom a different place. One may have mugged up all the classics and every sta=\r\ntement therein, yet, whether his predictions will come true or not is not g=\r\nauranteed. It is purely based on the shakti acquired through some sort of s=\r\nadhana in some lifetime. It is like a bank balance. But these days, jyotish=\r\nis are mere jyotishis. They hardly do any serious sadhana. Which means all =\r\nthey do is cash in on previous karmic balance they had acquired and use it =\r\nfor predictions. The day this balance gets over, in this life or=C2=A0the n=\r\next,=C2=A0all knowledge of scriptures won&#39;t help the=C2=A0jyotishi one bit =\r\nin getting an accurate=C2=A0prediction. \n=C2=A0\nA yantra may work if suffic=\r\nient energy is infused into it. To infuse that energy, again you need someo=\r\nne who has the energy to infuse it. Or one can keep worshipping the yantra =\r\ntill it acquires sufficient energy. \n=C2=A0\nSo, considering all these, I fe=\r\nel it is far=C2=A0better to keep focusing on ones own sadhana with greater =\r\nintensity, rather than spending time analysing horoscopes to find out short=\r\n-cut remedies. \n=C2=A0\nJust some random thoughts.\n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Raj=\r\narshi\n=C2=A0\n\n--- On Fri, 11/6/10, vemparlaramkishore &lt;vemparlaramkishore@y=\r\nahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: vemparlaramkishore &lt;vemparlaramkishore@...&gt;\n=\r\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Efficacy of Remedial Measures\nTo: vedic-wisdom@=\r\nyahoogroups.com\nDate: Friday, 11 June, 2010, 1:18 AM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\nBiswajit =\r\nJi\n\nEven though the question was not addressed to me and am no where having=\r\n the knowledge level of Narasimha Ji or other learned members, Let me attem=\r\npt an answer.\n\nK .N Rao ji has proved very conclusively that the gemstone t=\r\nherapy has no scriptural basis in any of the jyotisha classics.BPHS does no=\r\nt have a mention of the gem stones at all .

Do they work? I will give my 2 cents=\r\n of views based on my experience and insights. I will be honest, straight-f=\r\norward and blunt.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Though believers call priests and=\r\n get poojas done, in the hope that their problems will be solved, many prie=\r\nsts today are incapable of producing any results. As a result, some believe=\r\nrs got accustomed to accepting that a pudding exists even without eating it=\r\n and remain hungry throughout life. And some intelligent people stopped bel=\r\nieving in god and in remedies. Let me first address why this has come to be=\r\n and then talk about what we should do.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In ancient times, caste sy=\r\nstem was not as rigid as it is today. One&#39;s varna was decided based on one&#39;=\r\ns aptitude. One primarily interested in knowledge and spiritual progress wo=\r\nuld be a Brahmana. One primarily interested in power, authority and control=\r\n over others would be a Kshatriya. One primarily interested in money would =\r\nbe a Vaisya. One primarily interested in physical pleasures would be a Shud=\r\nra. One would start off with the varna of one&#39;s father, as that is what one=\r\n is exposed to in childhood. However, as one&#39;s vasana (mental conditioning)=\r\n blooms, one would get one&#39;s own varna. One born a Shudra like Valmiki, for=\r\n example, can later turn into a Braahmana and become a Maharshi. One born a=\r\n Kshatriya like Viswamitra, for example, can later turn into a Brahmana and=\r\n become a Maharshi.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the old days, there were true Brahmanas, wh=\r\no would only be interested in knowledge and spiritual progress and not cari=\r\nng about power, influence, money, pleasures etc. Such Brahmanas became quit=\r\ne pure and accumulated enough spiritual energy through continuous sadhana o=\r\nver years and were capable of performing very effective poojas for people.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Today, people who have spiritual potential may be born in non-Brah=\r\nmana families and not allowed to develop fully due to the rigid caste struc=\r\ntures. Some people born in Brahmana families may also end up getting into m=\r\nodern careers and not developing fully as Brahmanas. Some people may be bor=\r\nn in Brahmana families with Kshatriya/Vaisya/Shudra tendencies and may end =\r\nup becoming priests who are interested in power, authority and control over=\r\n others, money and physical pleasures. Those priests who only care about kn=\r\nowledge and spiritual progress (i.e. true Brahmanas) are very rare. As a re=\r\nsult, Brahmanas who have done genuine sadhana and accumulated a good amount=\r\n of spiritual energy are so few.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If one has one mil=\r\nlion dollars in one&#39;s bank account, a check given by one for thousand dolla=\r\nrs is meaningful. If one&#39;s bank account is empty, what good is a thousand d=\r\nollar check given by one? It will bounce. Similarly, poojas done and blessi=\r\nngs given by a priest without enough spiritual energy cannot bring one any =\r\nbenefits.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One important note: The power is not in a combination of=\r\n syllables (mantra) or a sequence of physical actions (ritual). The power i=\r\ns in the MIND that FOCUSES on a combination of syllables (mantra) or a sequ=\r\nence of physical actions (ritual). Energy is generated when mind overcomes =\r\nits tendency to wander and instead focuses on one thing. Different mantras =\r\nand rituals as the focus points may generate different kinds of energy, but=\r\n the key is focus. Without it, no mantra or ritual produces anything. Focus=\r\n comes with a lot of practice. Most priests are just engaging in casual pra=\r\nctice when they go and do poojas. In the old days, priests did intense sadh=\r\nana and brought that energy to the table when they did rituals at the house=\r\ns of people or in temples.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I did see priests who have done good sa=\r\ndhana, purified themselves and carry some spiritual energy. But those are g=\r\netting rarer and rarer now-a-days. One can most certainly not bank on findi=\r\nng such a priest.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Given this, one is better off not=\r\n depending on the priest/Brahmana class for remedies. BTW, I have nothing a=\r\ngainst the &quot;Brahmana by birth&quot; class, having been born in an orthodox Brahm=\r\nana family myself. I have neither love nor hatred for the &quot;Brahmana by birt=\r\nh&quot; class. My only wish is that more people - from any birth caste - develop=\r\n into true Brahmanas.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Instead of a Brahmana-by-birth who is possib=\r\nly proud of his skills and thinking about money and possibly not identifyin=\r\ng with your trouble, you can do the mantra/ritual yourself. Atleast your id=\r\nentification with the trouble and your desire to solve the problem will be =\r\nbetter than the priest. If you manage to generate enough focus after practi=\r\nce, the mantra/ritual may actually produce some result. There is no harm in=\r\n trying.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Many people think that poojas to gods are =\r\na serious matter and only a trained priest should do them. The procedures h=\r\nave evolved to become quite complicated over the time too!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However=\r\n, complexity of rituals should never be a deterrent. Suppose rules dictate =\r\nthat you MUST eat 2000 calories everyday, 40 grams of protein, so many gram=\r\ns of vitamin A etc. Suppose you have no access to such balanced food. Will =\r\nyou starve yourself until you find a balanced meal or will you manage with =\r\nwhatever you have? If you just have a bowl of dal (lentil soup) and rice, y=\r\nou will simply eat it. You atleast get some energy.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Similarly, if =\r\nyou do not know the &quot;perfect way&quot; to do a mantra/ritual, you need not wait =\r\ntill you know the perfect way. You can start with what you know. It will on=\r\nly give you energy.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The fear to do rituals without =\r\n&quot;perfect knowledge&quot; stems from the notion that some mantras/rituals can be =\r\ndangerous. That notion is not totally baseless, but it is irrelevant today.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is possible to focus the mind on some mantras and rituals and =\r\nget specific results. When used by someone with a high level of spiritual e=\r\nnergy, some mantras and rituals may work very fast and give specific powerf=\r\nul results. However, Nature has purposely hidden (almost) such things in th=\r\nis age.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I will give an analogy. A machine gun and a stick can be u=\r\nsed to attack enemies. Stick is safe to use, but, one using a machine gun n=\r\needs to be very careful. One needs to learn well, practice well and then us=\r\ne it, lest one should hurt oneself by accident.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, suppose t=\r\nhe house lord purposely removed ammunition from the machine gun. Then it is=\r\n used just like a stick and not risky. Instead of waiting for perfect instr=\r\nuctions on how to use the machine gun, just take it and start beating your =\r\nenemies with it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ammunition&quot; has purposely been removed from most=\r\n targeted mantras and rituals (machine guns) in this age. Instead of waitin=\r\ng for perfect knowledge, one can start using them right away.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A lo=\r\nt of technicalities related to mantras and rituals are irrelevant today. Ma=\r\nntras and rituals are to be taken up with faith, devotion and surrender to =\r\ngod. Whatever technicalities one can realistically follow should be followe=\r\nd and emphasis should be placed on devotion and surrender. If one keeps doi=\r\nng sadhana, eventually one&#39;s devotion and focus will improve and, for all y=\r\nou know, a result may come.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Given that we do not have perfect focu=\r\ns and surrender, we cannot expect specific results to come in specific coun=\r\nts of recitation. So we should just do the best job we can and leave the re=\r\nsult to god, who decides when and what result should be given.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bot=\r\ntomline is that no effort is wasted in the end. Every sincere effort genera=\r\ntes some fruit or the other, sometime or the other!!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Different mantras and rituals are like begging bowls of different shapes=\r\n. They matter only so much. Depending on what kind of a begging bowl you us=\r\ne, you may be given different kind of alms. But it is important to start be=\r\ngging with some begging bowl or the other, instead of spending years lookin=\r\ng for the perfect begging bowl.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Instead of waiting for astrologers=\r\n with half-baked or ill-conceived knowledge to tell you the perfect mantra =\r\nor ritual, do what your heart tells you or what your guru (or an elder you =\r\nrespect) tells you. Mantras like Gayatri mantra, Shiva panchakshari mantra,=\r\n Vishnu sahasranaama stotra, Ganapathi atharva seersha, Hanuman chalisa, Bh=\r\neemarupi Hanuman stotra, Vishnu&#39;s shadakshari/ashtakshari/dwadasakshari man=\r\ntra, Venkateswara&#39;s ashtakshari/dwadasakshari mantra, hare krishna mantra, =\r\nChandipath (Durga saptashati), Durga saptashloki, Lalita sahasranaama stotr=\r\na, Vyasa&#39;s navagraha stotra, Aditya Hridayam, Lakshmi ashtottarashatanaama =\r\nstotra etc are *generic* and can work for anyone for any purpose.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nDo not waste time looking for a perfect recommendation, perfect procedure, =\r\nperfect muhurta etc and just do some sadhana or the other with a sincere he=\r\nart.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Your effort will not go waste. Your problem may be solved or =\r\nyou may overcome your situation and stop worrying, or atleast your focus wi=\r\nll improve.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In this context, I want to say a few wo=\r\nrds about homam, the sadhana of rishis.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Fire ritual is found in ma=\r\nny ancient religions. Unlike the elements of earth, water and air, fire is =\r\never pure and it purifies whatever it comes in contact with. The Sanskrit n=\r\name for fire is paavaka, i.e. purifier. Fire is a living god that everyone =\r\nhas access to. Spending time worshipping god through fire purifies one&#39;s su=\r\nbtle consciousness. Homam is far more effective than most other sadhanas in=\r\n improving one&#39;s focus, changing one&#39;s inner personality and removing mater=\r\nial and spiritual obstacles. One need not take my words for granted. One ca=\r\nn try for oneself for a few months. The proof of the pudding is in eating i=\r\nt.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Vedic seers (rishis) performed homam regularly, for the benefit=\r\n of the world. When composing the Jyotish masterpiece &quot;Brihat Paaraasara Ho=\r\nraa Saastram&quot; just before the advent of Kali yuga, for guidance to the peop=\r\nle of Kali yuga, Maharshi Parasara recommended various types of homam as re=\r\nmedial measures for various problems in the horoscope. In fact, most remedi=\r\nes he recommended involve homam. Parasara asked to follow whatever procedur=\r\nes one was taught for starting fire and did not focus on the nitty gritty o=\r\nf homam. He only gave the main mantra to beused in homam. Parasara&#39;s clear =\r\nteachings set to rest the notion that some people have, that homam is not f=\r\nor Kali yuga.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna said, &quot;=\r\nyaGYaanaaM japayaGYo.asmi&quot;, i.e. I am japa among all sacrifices. Some peopl=\r\ne use this line to suggest that japam (meditation) is superior to homa/yajn=\r\na. Let me put that in perspective.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the line just above that lin=\r\ne, Sri Krishna also said, &quot;I am Om among all mantras&quot;. However, do we only =\r\nmeditate with the supreme mantra &quot;Om&quot; and leave all other mantras?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n If one says that sitting on the pinnacle is the best part of climbing a mo=\r\nuntain, it does not mean that the process of climbing it using various kind=\r\ns of gear is useless. In fact, one needs that process to reach the pinnacle=\r\n. Most cannot reach the pinnacle directly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Similarly, Om is the su=\r\npreme of all mantras being the source of all, but reaching the source may r=\r\nequire using several mantras first to purify oneself. Meditating and absorb=\r\ning consciousness in the Supreme (japa) may be the supreme sacrifice, but i=\r\nt may require purification and preparation by engaging in other kinds of sa=\r\ncrifices (hama/yajna).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When one does homam or yajna, one is engagi=\r\nng in external actions and one is unlikely to reach samadhi (absorbption in=\r\n the Supreme). When a perfectly purified person does japam (i.e. sits still=\r\n and contemplates), one may reach samadhi. However, to purify oneself, homa=\r\nm is far more effective.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Detailed manuals giving sh=\r\nort procedures for doing various types of homam by oneself are available on=\r\n the website given below. You can use the resources on that website to perf=\r\norm several kinds of short homam by yourself.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now *hundreds* of pe=\r\nople are performing homam by themselves either daily or weekly. Some people=\r\n are also doing monthly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When Manish (my spiritual guru - a small =\r\nwrite-up on him can be read in message 3481 of vedic-wisdom yahoogroup, i.e=\r\n. http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3481) told me that the=\r\n Divine Mother appeared before him during Shata Chandi homam at a temple in=\r\n Chennai in March 2006, directed him to spread a simplified homam ritual ar=\r\nound the world, and showed him that hundreds of thousands of people would b=\r\ne performing regular homam in a few years, thus helping reverse the decay o=\r\nf Dharma and Truth on earth, it seemed quite far-fetched to my rational min=\r\nd.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, just 4 years after the Mother&#39;s command, hundreds of p=\r\neople are already performing regular homam. Though these are just the early=\r\n days, the developments are amazing. Some of them are laymen who never even=\r\n lit a lamp and did not know how to do ANY pooja or ritual. It is a miracle=\r\n that such people are doing a homam everyday, like the rishis and Brahmanas=\r\n of yore. I also know personally that some people doing homam for a couple =\r\nof years are actually starting to experience things within and outside and,=\r\n more importantly, going through rapid internal transformation.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * =\r\n* *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am neither a missionary nor a mercenary. I do not sell anyth=\r\ning to anyone, nor do I force anything on anyone. I just freely share what =\r\nI know, what I saw and what I am inspired to share.

The problem is not with Jyotish as a subject. The problem is =\r\nwith Jyotishis. Their knowledge is imperfect. Based on such imperfect knowl=\r\nedge when people recommend gemstones etc, they may or may not work out.&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;But if we look at it from another point of view, =\r\nevery affliction - mental/phsyical/spiritual -&nbsp;is finally a karmic rea=\r\nction. And when one does sadhana, one is basically trying hard to finsh off=\r\n his storehouse of karmas. Finally God realization is about finsh off the k=\r\narmas which block progress. Instead of putting faith on imperfect jyotishis=\r\n, one is much better off putting his/her faith on a deity whose sadhana he/=\r\nshe is doing and the deity will guide the person correctly in what needs to=\r\n be done. So in that sense, when one plunges into serious sadhana, the pers=\r\non does not feel like consulting jyotishis or checking out charts. The pers=\r\npective about life changes. I once made a collection of charts of people wh=\r\no were good, genuine sadhakas, with some amount of spiritual progress. Some=\r\n were famous, some not famous. When I showed these charts to different jyot=\r\nishis asking them about what is the most defining characteristics of this i=\r\nndividual,\n they came up with all sorts of weird answers which were anythin=\r\ng but true. Once a&nbsp;jyotishi knows that the chart belongs to a genuinel=\r\ny spiritual person,&nbsp;he can smoothly back engineer many combinations an=\r\nd prove his point. But if no clue is provided, he mostlty fails, specially =\r\nwhen juding spiritual charts. This could well be because when a sadhaka doe=\r\ns sadhana, he burns off karmas, thus a completely&nbsp;new frequency of ana=\r\nlysis is needed. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;In my view=\r\n, the ability to predict the future has nothing to do with knowledge of Jyo=\r\ntish scriptures/shastras. It comes from a different place. One may have mug=\r\nged up all the classics and every statement therein, yet, whether his predi=\r\nctions will come true or not is not gauranteed. It is purely based on the s=\r\nhakti acquired through some sort of sadhana in some lifetime. It is like a =\r\nbank balance. But these days, jyotishis are mere jyotishis. They hardly do =\r\nany serious sadhana. Which means all they do is cash in on previous karmic =\r\nbalance they had acquired and use it for predictions. The day this balance =\r\ngets over, in this life or&nbsp;the next,&nbsp;all knowledge of scriptures =\r\nwon&#39;t help the&nbsp;jyotishi one bit in getting an accurate&nbsp;prediction=\r\n. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;A yantra may work if sufficient energy is i=\r\nnfused into it. To infuse that energy, again you need someone who has the e=\r\nnergy to infuse it. Or one can keep worshipping the yantra till it acquires=\r\n sufficient energy. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;So, considering all these=\r\n, I feel it is far&nbsp;better to keep focusing on ones own sadhana with gr=\r\neater intensity, rather than spending time analysing horoscopes to find out=\r\n short-cut remedies. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Just some random thought=\r\ns.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Fri, 11/6/10, vemparlaramkishore &lt;I&gt;&lt;=\r\nvemparlaramkishore@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=\r\n=3D&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px so=\r\nlid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: vemparlaramkishore &lt;vemparlaramkishore@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;S=\r\nubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Efficacy of Remedial Measures&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Friday, 11 June, 2010, 1:18 AM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=\r\n=3Dyiv1476362524&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;DISPLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dygr=\r\np-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Biswajit Ji&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Even though the question was not addressed =\r\nto me and am no where having the knowledge level of Narasimha Ji or other l=\r\nearned members, Let me attempt an answer.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;K .N Rao ji has proved ver=\r\ny conclusively that the gemstone therapy has no scriptural basis in any of =\r\nthe jyotisha classics.BPHS does not have a mention of the gem stones at all=\r\n .

Do they wo=\r\nrk? I will give my 2 cents of views based on my experience and insights. I =\r\nwill be honest, straight-forward and blunt.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * =\r\n*&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Though believers call priests and get poojas d=\r\none, in the hope that their problems will be solved, many priests today are=\r\n\n incapable of producing any results. As a result, some believers got accus=\r\ntomed to accepting that a pudding exists even without eating it and remain =\r\nhungry throughout life. And some intelligent people stopped believing in go=\r\nd and in remedies. Let me first address why this has come to be and then ta=\r\nlk about what we should do.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In ancient times, ca=\r\nste system was not as rigid as it is today. One&#39;s varna was decided based o=\r\nn one&#39;s aptitude. One primarily interested in knowledge and spiritual progr=\r\ness would be a Brahmana. One primarily interested in power, authority and c=\r\nontrol over others would be a Kshatriya. One primarily interested in money =\r\nwould be a Vaisya. One primarily interested in physical pleasures would be =\r\na Shudra. One would start off with the varna of one&#39;s father, as that is wh=\r\nat one is exposed to in childhood. However, as one&#39;s vasana (mental conditi=\r\noning) blooms, one would get one&#39;s own varna. One born a Shudra like\n Valmi=\r\nki, for example, can later turn into a Braahmana and become a Maharshi. One=\r\n born a Kshatriya like Viswamitra, for example, can later turn into a Brahm=\r\nana and become a Maharshi.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In the old days, ther=\r\ne were true Brahmanas, who would only be interested in knowledge and spirit=\r\nual progress and not caring about power, influence, money, pleasures etc. S=\r\nuch Brahmanas became quite pure and accumulated enough spiritual energy thr=\r\nough continuous sadhana over years and were capable of performing very effe=\r\nctive poojas for people.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Today, people who have =\r\nspiritual potential may be born in non-Brahmana families and not allowed to=\r\n develop fully due to the rigid caste structures. Some people born in Brahm=\r\nana families may also end up getting into modern careers and not developing=\r\n fully as Brahmanas. Some people may be born in Brahmana families with Ksha=\r\ntriya/Vaisya/Shudra tendencies and may end up becoming priests\n who are int=\r\nerested in power, authority and control over others, money and physical ple=\r\nasures. Those priests who only care about knowledge and spiritual progress =\r\n(i.e. true Brahmanas) are very rare. As a result, Brahmanas who have done g=\r\nenuine sadhana and accumulated a good amount of spiritual energy are so few=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If one has on=\r\ne million dollars in one&#39;s bank account, a check given by one for thousand =\r\ndollars is meaningful. If one&#39;s bank account is empty, what good is a thous=\r\nand dollar check given by one? It will bounce. Similarly, poojas done and b=\r\nlessings given by a priest without enough spiritual energy cannot bring one=\r\n any benefits.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; One important note: The power is =\r\nnot in a combination of syllables (mantra) or a sequence of physical action=\r\ns (ritual). The power is in the MIND that FOCUSES on a combination of sylla=\r\nbles (mantra) or a sequence of physical actions\n (ritual). Energy is genera=\r\nted when mind overcomes its tendency to wander and instead focuses on one t=\r\nhing. Different mantras and rituals as the focus points may generate differ=\r\nent kinds of energy, but the key is focus. Without it, no mantra or ritual =\r\nproduces anything. Focus comes with a lot of practice. Most priests are jus=\r\nt engaging in casual practice when they go and do poojas. In the old days, =\r\npriests did intense sadhana and brought that energy to the table when they =\r\ndid rituals at the houses of people or in temples.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; I did see priests who have done good sadhana, purified themselves and ca=\r\nrry some spiritual energy. But those are getting rarer and rarer now-a-days=\r\n. One can most certainly not bank on finding such a priest.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Given this, one is better off =\r\nnot depending on the priest/Brahmana class for remedies. BTW, I have nothin=\r\ng against the &quot;Brahmana by birth&quot; class,\n having been born in an orthodox B=\r\nrahmana family myself. I have neither love nor hatred for the &quot;Brahmana by =\r\nbirth&quot; class. My only wish is that more people - from any birth caste - dev=\r\nelop into true Brahmanas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Instead of a Brahmana-=\r\nby-birth who is possibly proud of his skills and thinking about money and p=\r\nossibly not identifying with your trouble, you can do the mantra/ritual you=\r\nrself. Atleast your identification with the trouble and your desire to solv=\r\ne the problem will be better than the priest. If you manage to generate eno=\r\nugh focus after practice, the mantra/ritual may actually produce some resul=\r\nt. There is no harm in trying.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Many people think that poojas to gods are a serious matter =\r\nand only a trained priest should do them. The procedures have evolved to be=\r\ncome quite complicated over the time too!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Howeve=\r\nr, complexity of rituals should\n never be a deterrent. Suppose rules dictat=\r\ne that you MUST eat 2000 calories everyday, 40 grams of protein, so many gr=\r\nams of vitamin A etc. Suppose you have no access to such balanced food. Wil=\r\nl you starve yourself until you find a balanced meal or will you manage wit=\r\nh whatever you have? If you just have a bowl of dal (lentil soup) and rice,=\r\n you will simply eat it. You atleast get some energy.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Similarly, if you do not know the &quot;perfect way&quot; to do a mantra/ritual=\r\n, you need not wait till you know the perfect way. You can start with what =\r\nyou know. It will only give you energy.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The fear to do rituals without &quot;perfect knowledge&quot;=\r\n stems from the notion that some mantras/rituals can be dangerous. That not=\r\nion is not totally baseless, but it is irrelevant today.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; It is possible to focus the mind on some mantras and rituals and g=\r\net specific results. When\n used by someone with a high level of spiritual e=\r\nnergy, some mantras and rituals may work very fast and give specific powerf=\r\nul results. However, Nature has purposely hidden (almost) such things in th=\r\nis age.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I will give an analogy. A machine gun an=\r\nd a stick can be used to attack enemies. Stick is safe to use, but, one usi=\r\nng a machine gun needs to be very careful. One needs to learn well, practic=\r\ne well and then use it, lest one should hurt oneself by accident.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; However, suppose the house lord purposely removed ammunit=\r\nion from the machine gun. Then it is used just like a stick and not risky. =\r\nInstead of waiting for perfect instructions on how to use the machine gun, =\r\njust take it and start beating your enemies with it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &quot;Ammunition&quot; has purposely been removed from most targeted mantras and=\r\n rituals (machine guns) in this age. Instead of waiting for perfect knowled=\r\nge, one can start\n using them right away.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; A lot =\r\nof technicalities related to mantras and rituals are irrelevant today. Mant=\r\nras and rituals are to be taken up with faith, devotion and surrender to go=\r\nd. Whatever technicalities one can realistically follow should be followed =\r\nand emphasis should be placed on devotion and surrender. If one keeps doing=\r\n sadhana, eventually one&#39;s devotion and focus will improve and, for all you=\r\n know, a result may come.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Given that we do not h=\r\nave perfect focus and surrender, we cannot expect specific results to come =\r\nin specific counts of recitation. So we should just do the best job we can =\r\nand leave the result to god, who decides when and what result should be giv=\r\nen.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bottomline is that no effort is wasted in th=\r\ne end. Every sincere effort generates some fruit or the other, sometime or =\r\nthe other!!!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Di=\r\nfferent\n mantras and rituals are like begging bowls of different shapes. Th=\r\ney matter only so much. Depending on what kind of a begging bowl you use, y=\r\nou may be given different kind of alms. But it is important to start beggin=\r\ng with some begging bowl or the other, instead of spending years looking fo=\r\nr the perfect begging bowl.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Instead of waiting f=\r\nor astrologers with half-baked or ill-conceived knowledge to tell you the p=\r\nerfect mantra or ritual, do what your heart tells you or what your guru (or=\r\n an elder you respect) tells you. Mantras like Gayatri mantra, Shiva pancha=\r\nkshari mantra, Vishnu sahasranaama stotra, Ganapathi atharva seersha, Hanum=\r\nan chalisa, Bheemarupi Hanuman stotra, Vishnu&#39;s shadakshari/ashtakshari/dwa=\r\ndasakshari mantra, Venkateswara&#39;s ashtakshari/dwadasakshari mantra, hare kr=\r\nishna mantra, Chandipath (Durga saptashati), Durga saptashloki, Lalita saha=\r\nsranaama stotra, Vyasa&#39;s navagraha stotra, Aditya Hridayam, Lakshmi\n ashtot=\r\ntarashatanaama stotra etc are *generic* and can work for anyone for any pur=\r\npose.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do not waste time looking for a perfect re=\r\ncommendation, perfect procedure, perfect muhurta etc and just do some sadha=\r\nna or the other with a sincere heart.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Your effor=\r\nt will not go waste. Your problem may be solved or you may overcome your si=\r\ntuation and stop worrying, or atleast your focus will improve.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In this context, I want to =\r\nsay a few words about homam, the sadhana of rishis.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; Fire ritual is found in many ancient religions. Unlike the elements of =\r\nearth, water and air, fire is ever pure and it purifies whatever it comes i=\r\nn contact with. The Sanskrit name for fire is paavaka, i.e. purifier. Fire =\r\nis a living god that everyone has access to. Spending time worshipping god =\r\nthrough fire purifies one&#39;s subtle consciousness. Homam is\n far more effect=\r\nive than most other sadhanas in improving one&#39;s focus, changing one&#39;s inner=\r\n personality and removing material and spiritual obstacles. One need not ta=\r\nke my words for granted. One can try for oneself for a few months. The proo=\r\nf of the pudding is in eating it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Vedic seers (r=\r\nishis) performed homam regularly, for the benefit of the world. When compos=\r\ning the Jyotish masterpiece &quot;Brihat Paaraasara Horaa Saastram&quot; just before =\r\nthe advent of Kali yuga, for guidance to the people of Kali yuga, Maharshi =\r\nParasara recommended various types of homam as remedial measures for variou=\r\ns problems in the horoscope. In fact, most remedies he recommended involve =\r\nhomam. Parasara asked to follow whatever procedures one was taught for star=\r\nting fire and did not focus on the nitty gritty of homam. He only gave the =\r\nmain mantra to beused in homam. Parasara&#39;s clear teachings set to rest the =\r\nnotion that some people have, that homam is not for\n Kali yuga.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In Bhagavad Gita, Sri Kris=\r\nhna said, &quot;yaGYaanaaM japayaGYo.asmi&quot;, i.e. I am japa among all sacrifices.=\r\n Some people use this line to suggest that japam (meditation) is superior t=\r\no homa/yajna. Let me put that in perspective.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In=\r\n the line just above that line, Sri Krishna also said, &quot;I am Om among all m=\r\nantras&quot;. However, do we only meditate with the supreme mantra &quot;Om&quot; and leav=\r\ne all other mantras?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If one says that sitting on=\r\n the pinnacle is the best part of climbing a mountain, it does not mean tha=\r\nt the process of climbing it using various kinds of gear is useless. In fac=\r\nt, one needs that process to reach the pinnacle. Most cannot reach the pinn=\r\nacle directly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Similarly, Om is the supreme of a=\r\nll mantras being the source of all, but reaching the source may require usi=\r\nng several mantras first to purify oneself.\n Meditating and absorbing consc=\r\niousness in the Supreme (japa) may be the supreme sacrifice, but it may req=\r\nuire purification and preparation by engaging in other kinds of sacrifices =\r\n(hama/yajna).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; When one does homam or yajna, one =\r\nis engaging in external actions and one is unlikely to reach samadhi (absor=\r\nbption in the Supreme). When a perfectly purified person does japam (i.e. s=\r\nits still and contemplates), one may reach samadhi. However, to purify ones=\r\nelf, homam is far more effective.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Detailed manuals giving short procedures for doing vario=\r\nus types of homam by oneself are available on the website given below. You =\r\ncan use the resources on that website to perform several kinds of short hom=\r\nam by yourself.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Now *hundreds* of people are per=\r\nforming homam by themselves either daily or weekly. Some people are also do=\r\ning monthly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; When Manish (my spiritual guru - a=\r\n small write-up on him can be read in message 3481 of vedic-wisdom yahoogro=\r\nup, i.e. &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3481=\r\n&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom=\r\n/message/3481&lt;/A&gt;) told me that the Divine Mother appeared before him durin=\r\ng Shata Chandi homam at a temple in Chennai in March 2006, directed him to =\r\nspread a simplified homam ritual around the world, and showed him that hund=\r\nreds of thousands of people would be performing regular homam in a few year=\r\ns, thus helping reverse the decay of Dharma and Truth on earth, it seemed q=\r\nuite far-fetched to my rational mind.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; However, j=\r\nust 4 years after the Mother&#39;s command, hundreds of people are already perf=\r\norming regular homam. Though these are just the early days, the development=\r\ns are amazing. Some of them are laymen who never even lit a lamp and did no=\r\nt know how to do ANY pooja or\n ritual. It is a miracle that such people are=\r\n doing a homam everyday, like the rishis and Brahmanas of yore. I also know=\r\n personally that some people doing homam for a couple of years are actually=\r\n starting to experience things within and outside and, more importantly, go=\r\ning through rapid internal transformation.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I am neither a missionary nor a mercenary. I do=\r\n not sell anything to anyone, nor do I force anything on anyone. I just fre=\r\nely share what I know, what I saw and what I am inspired to share. The rest=\r\n is not in my hands.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I want to respectfully, hum=\r\nbly and lovingly invite those who have even an iota of interest to check ou=\r\nt the homam website! If one gets into the habit of performing homam regular=\r\nly, it has the great potential to transform one&#39;s life, materially and spir=\r\nitually..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Homam website:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;A\n href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Best rega=\r\nrds,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------=\r\n------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish L=\r\nessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for =\r\nshort Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastr=\r\nologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;=\r\n/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatif=\r\nilms.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisd=\r\nom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisd=\r\nom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/gr=\r\noup/JyotishWritings&quot; target=3D_blank\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------=\r\n------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BL=\r\nOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n--0-277406812-1276241719=:88827--\r\n\n"}}
