So I will not comment on your faith. \nBut, I will justify one point I made which you questioned.\n\n&gt;&gt; Bottomline is that we are discussing things intellectually when we use\n&gt;&gt; vaikhari (*tangible* words - written or spoken) to communicate. We are \n&gt;&gt; not\n&gt;&gt; communicating here using para or pasyanti or madhyama modes. Of course, \n&gt;&gt; even\n&gt;&gt; in the debate, Sri Sri and Dr Naik seemed to be using vaikhari only.\n&gt;\n&gt; How do we know that? Dr. Naik was using vaikhari as was evident from\n&gt; his body language. Sri Sri was totally composed throughout the meeting and\n&gt; afterwards, which is not possible for someone not established in \n&gt; equanimity.\n\nOne can be seething with anger or sinking in shame internally and look \ntotally composed externally. Body language after the debate does not mean \nmuch.\n\nLet me tell you how I concluded that vaikhari &quot;seemed to be&quot; predominant in \nthe debate.\n\nLook at the reactions to the debate. After the debate, a lot of Hindus who \nwatched it were very disappointed and disillusioned. Many average Hindus \nthought their religion was perhaps meaningless if somebody of the stature of \nRavishankar was unable to explain inconsistencies even when given time and \nstage. Dr Naik was using Hindu scruptures to support his forceful and \ndestructive points against Hinduism and Ravishankar was unable to counter \nhim. You agreed earlier that several of even AOL members were disappointed \nand confused. As I said earlier, Dr Naik was rated as #3 spiritual teacher \nof India in a poll later.\n\nBasically, reactions of people were entirely along the lines expected based \non an intellectual analysis of the tangible words spoken. That suggests that \nthe communication was mostly in vaikhari (tangible words). If the intangible \nforce behind the words was strong, there would&#39;ve been an impact on people \nthat cannot be captured by an intellectual analysis of the tangible words \nspoken alone.\n\nAs an example, I mentioned Swami Vivekananda. When he finally mustered \ncourage and spoke at the Chicago parliament of religions, thousands of \npeople rose to their feet and cheered. Hundreds rushed towards the stage to \nhave a closer look at him. One person who was present there described later \nthat an indescribable excitement captured the hearts of many. If you \nintellectually analyze his spoken words, that reaction cannot be explained. \nPeople were reacting to something intangible in his speech! While tangible \nwords are vaikhari, that intangible force behind the words is madhyama, \npasyanti and para, in an increasing order of the power of impact.\n\nOne does encounter some works where there is an intangible force behind the \nwritten/spoken words.\n\nWhile many may have a capability to touch *a few* people with an intangible \nforce when they speak, based on the rinas, very very few masters have the \nability to touch *many* people at the same time with an intangible force \nwhen they speak or write. I cannot comment on Sri Sri overall, but he seemed \nto lack such ability on that fateful day when he walked onto the stage as \nthe representative of Hinduism.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;schinnas&quot; &lt;schinnas@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, November 30, 2009 9:44 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: AOL: Seamless blend of Raja, Karma, Bhakti and \nGnana Yogas\n\n\n&gt; Dear Shri. Narasimha,\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dear Siva,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; My sincere apologies if I offended you or offend you now.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for your sincerity. I am grateful for you to be giving your sincere \n&gt; opinions on this topic. There is nothing for me to get offended. My faith \n&gt; in Sri Sri is based on my personal experiences and feelings from my heart. \n&gt; Opinions of other sadhaks or scholars, however experienced they are, are \n&gt; not my experiences and I neither feel elated nor depressed based on their \n&gt; views. I ventured into this discussion as this question was asked to me \n&gt; specifically and I felt I could clarify some aspects of it.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Krishna ran away because Jarasandh should not be killed by him and was\n&gt;&gt; destined to be killed by Bheema. But please note that it was *Jarasandh* \n&gt;&gt; who\n&gt;&gt; attacked.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In the case of the debate in question, it was agreed to by *both* the \n&gt;&gt; sides,\n&gt;&gt; pre-planned as a mega event, rules were laid out, it was advertized well \n&gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; 50,000 people showed up! Many more must have watched it.\n&gt;\n&gt; ...\n&gt; ...\n&gt; ...\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yes, an avatar may choose to lose if it is necessary for a larger purpose \n&gt;&gt; in\n&gt;&gt; the leela as you said, but I fail to see any &quot;larger purpose&quot; in this \n&gt;&gt; thing\n&gt;&gt; yet.\n&gt;\n&gt; You see a larger purpose in Sri Krishna&#39;s act because you have faith in \n&gt; Him as a Purna Avatar. If you were a non believer in Sri Krishna, you \n&gt; could not have agreed to these arguments that justify Sri Krishnas&#39; act. \n&gt; Similarly, a believer in Sri Sri may see a higher reason in this episode. \n&gt; He might say that Sri Sri being a trikal gnani knew this had to happen and \n&gt; voluntarily went through this with equanimity. You have to use the same \n&gt; yardstick in both sides of the argument. Faith free logic is not possible \n&gt; in Spirituality...at least not till the end. At some point a leap has to \n&gt; be made, which may be different from person to person.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; In hind sight, I realize that I should not have ventured to give an\n&gt;&gt; &gt; intellectual\n&gt;&gt; &gt; explanation for something that I myself have not yet intellectually\n&gt;&gt; &gt; understood.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for admitting that you yourself have not yet intellectually\n&gt;&gt; understood it!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; It has been my position that this incident cannot be intellectually \n&gt; understood.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Because of your *faith* that Sri Sri is a yogi in &quot;sahaja samadhi&quot;, you\n&gt;&gt; believe that there must be some higher purpose served by this action of \n&gt;&gt; his.\n&gt;&gt; I respect your faith. Faith not supported by logic and intellectual\n&gt;&gt; understanding cannot be discussed further.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;A faith that is not blind is not a faith at all&quot;. Didn&#39;t Sri Ramakrishna \n&gt; and Sri Aurobindo say this? (exact words may be different) If you are \n&gt; looking for a faith supported by logic / intellectual understanding, then \n&gt; that &quot;faith&quot; could not be complete / integral faith, imho.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Bottomline is that we are discussing things intellectually when we use\n&gt;&gt; vaikhari (*tangible* words - written or spoken) to communicate. We are \n&gt;&gt; not\n&gt;&gt; communicating here using para or pasyanti or madhyama modes. Of course, \n&gt;&gt; even\n&gt;&gt; in the debate, Sri Sri and Dr Naik seemed to be using vaikhari only.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; How do we know that? Dr. Naik was using vaikhari as was evident from his \n&gt; body language. Sri Sri was totally composed throughout the meeting and \n&gt; afterwards, which is not possible for someone not established in \n&gt; equanimity. Para, pasyanti, madhyama will work only to the extent of \n&gt; sincerity / receptivity of the listeners. I have several first hand \n&gt; experiences of such instances with Sri Sri, where something he seemed to \n&gt; have said very casually shook up my being, sometimes immediately or \n&gt; sometimes much later. I was/am a very logical person living in the mind.. \n&gt; it was/is not easy for me to have such experiences.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes, you see some great masters communicating at levels higher than\n&gt;&gt; vaikhari. There is something unsaid (para, pasyanti or madhyama) that \n&gt;&gt; lies\n&gt;&gt; behind the said words (vaikhari) and gets into the mind of the listener \n&gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; creates an indelible effect on the mind. Swami Vivekananda&#39;s historic \n&gt;&gt; 1893\n&gt;&gt; speech at Chicago, for example, had a far more mesmerizing effect on the\n&gt;&gt; audience present there than you would expect those mere words to have.\n&gt;\n&gt; The mechanism differs from Master to Master. Vivekanda&#39;s speech and \n&gt; writings are powerful. For Sri Sri, it is his presence. Few years ago in \n&gt; D.C, while Sri Sri was giving a talk, a well built American suddenly came \n&gt; running towards hims menacingly shouting &quot;Anti Christ&quot; and some other \n&gt; abuses. As he hurled towards him, Sri Sri just looked at him with total \n&gt; compassion and within a fraction of a second, that person fell at Sri \n&gt; Sri&#39;s feet sobbing. Now he is one of the sadhaks of AOL. There are several \n&gt; several such instances where people have transformative effect just in his \n&gt; mere presence. He may not even look at them or talk to them. It can \n&gt; arguably said that during a comparable time period, Sri Sri has had \n&gt; mesmerizing effect on several times more people than Swami Vivekananda \n&gt; had. Several muslim terrorists, naxalites have embraced Art of Living. \n&gt; There are Art of Living teachers among Pakistani muslims and Iraqis! Do \n&gt; you suppose it is possible with pure logical arguments?\n&gt;\n&gt; ...\n&gt; ...\n&gt; ...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If master debaters like Swami Vivekananda or Aadi Shankara had debated\n&gt;&gt; someone of the stature of Dr Naik, I can imagine what they would have \n&gt;&gt; done.\n&gt;\n&gt; I disagree. Each Master&#39;s way is different. An englightened Master that \n&gt; has come down for a Mission is not just a personality that reacts to \n&gt; situations in some pre-set way. They are manifestations of their mission. \n&gt; There is such an integrity in their whole being that every act, breath, \n&gt; word and body language will radiate one vibration which is the core of \n&gt; their mission.\n&gt;\n&gt; Swami Vivekananda came down to awaken India and her youth. His mission was \n&gt; to give the Shakthi to a comotose Hindu soul of that time. So naturally \n&gt; his very being radiated a Force needed for that mission.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sri Sri on the other hand has come down with a different mission - that of \n&gt; creating a one world family and reviving spiritual values in a manner that \n&gt; cuts across religions. His mission is to spread harmony, love, joy, and \n&gt; lightness everywhere and unite people that way. His very personality is \n&gt; harmonious, soft and his being radiates such an unconditional love. \n&gt; Whatever act he does, his very being will radiate harmony, love, joy and \n&gt; light. One needs to be in his presence for some time to realize this.\n&gt;\n&gt; IMHO, it is foolish to compare Masters for this very reason. Even though \n&gt; they both could have come from the same source, Vivekananda is not Sri Sri \n&gt; and for him to do the work of Sri Sri, he has to come down as another Sri \n&gt; Sri (personality wise)! Vice versa is true as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; Btw, that is one reason why Sri Krishna is called Purna Avatar because he \n&gt; radiated with all possible vibrations to its full effect in one life time!\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;\n&gt; Love,\n&gt;   Siva.\n\n\n"}}
