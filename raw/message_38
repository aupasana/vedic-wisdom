To answer this question properly, it depends on=\r\n what \nsomeone means by the term &quot;evidence&quot;.  Since reincarnation is a \nmet=\r\naphysical reality (meta =3D &quot;beyond&quot;; physical =3D &quot;material&quot;), and \nnot a =\r\nmaterial one, it doesn&#39;t stand to reason that there can really \nbe scientif=\r\nic &quot;evidence&quot; per se.  A non-material, metaphysical \nreality simply cannot =\r\nbe grasped by merely material physical means.  \n\nThat doesn&#39;t mean, though,=\r\n that reincarnation can&#39;t be proven.  After \nall, we can know that many oth=\r\ner non-material things exist that \ncannot be proven scientifically or empir=\r\nically.  For example, we all \nknow that we have minds=85yet no one can real=\r\nly see a mind.  We can&#39;t \nexamine a mind in a microscope, nor can we put a =\r\nmind in a test-\ntube.  The proof for your mind&#39;s existence is that we can i=\r\nnfer that \nyou have a mind because you act intelligently: you display the \n=\r\nattributes and actions of one who has a mind.  In the same way, \nreincarnat=\r\nion cannot be proven through scientific experimentation=85but \nit can be pr=\r\noven through inference and logic.  \n\nOne of the most powerful arguments for=\r\n upholding the fact of \nreincarnation is that, without the existence of rei=\r\nncarnation and \nkarma (reincarnation and karma are inseparable; you can&#39;t h=\r\nave one \nwithout the other), the existence of human suffering has no \nexpla=\r\nnation and no coherent meaning.  Logically speaking, we can only \nexplain t=\r\nhe meaning of suffering in the world by inferring the fact \nof reincarnatio=\r\nn and karma.  \n\nIf each of us merely pops into existence at the moment of c=\r\nonception, \nand did not have a pre-existence previous to the creation of th=\r\nis \nbody, then how do we explain the fact that some people are born with \nt=\r\nerrible birth defects (blindness, lacking a limb, etc.), and others \nare no=\r\nt?  How can a merciful and loving God allow some babies to be \nborn fine an=\r\nd healthy, and others to be born in a terrible state of \npain and suffering=\r\n?  Simply claiming that such instances are \nmerely &quot;divine mysteries&quot; is ju=\r\nst avoiding the question.  The only \nexplanation for suffering that does no=\r\nt make God seem either unjust \nor impotent is the concept of reincarnation/=\r\nkarma.  \n\nMore, we also see that people are all born with very different \nc=\r\napacities, talents, attributes, and personalities.  As much as we \nwant to =\r\npretend that all human beings are born as complete tabula \nrasas, or blank =\r\nslates, the truth is that none of us are born with \nequal intrinsic faculti=\r\nes.  Some people are born with more of an \ninherent talent to be creative a=\r\nnd artistic than others.  Some are \nborn more cerebral and intelligent than=\r\n others.  Some are born 7 feet \ntall and can become famous basketball playe=\r\nrs, while some are 5 feet \ntall, and cannot.  Again, the only logical expla=\r\nnation for why a just \nand merciful God would allow people to be born with =\r\nsuch diverse and \nunequal qualities is reincarnation and karma.  \n\nThe conc=\r\nept of reincarnation and karma is a principle of both \nuniversal justice an=\r\nd radical freedom of the individual to create \nhis/her own destiny.  This c=\r\noncept teaches us that with every \nthought, action and word containing ethi=\r\ncal-content that we engage \nin, we are freely creating who we are =96 and w=\r\nho we will be in the \nfuture.  When we perform actions that are of an ethic=\r\nally positive \nand good nature, we are directly affecting our own conscious=\r\nness in \nsuch a way as to purify and ennoble who we are.  Conversely, when =\r\nwe \nperform actions that arise from selfishness, egotism, and negativity, \n=\r\nwe are ensuring that our future only holds darkness and sorrow.  \n\nSo, the =\r\nconcept of reincarnation and karma, ultimately, is a positive \nand hopeful =\r\nconcept of radical freedom, in which each and every one \nof us has the abil=\r\nity, moment to moment, to freely create both \nourselves and our destinies. =\r\n With every decision we make today, we \nare creating our own futures, our o=\r\nwn destinies, and our own future \nlives.  Such is the grace and love of God=\r\n that He gives us the \ncomplete freedom either to choose to know Him, or to=\r\n flee from His \nface.  The choice to do one or the other is ours, and ours =\r\nalone.  \n\n________________________________________________________\n\nAnnounc=\r\nements:  \n\n1)  Another New York Teaching Tour\n\nDr. Morales&#39; last teaching t=\r\nour of the New York area was so \nsuccessful that he&#39;ll be returning to the =\r\narea this week for a brief \nvisit.
