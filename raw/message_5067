I finally got to read a little f=\r\nrom it. I am impressed with this work.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The book is called &quot;Invading t=\r\nhe Sacred: An Analysis of Hinduism Studies in America&quot; (editors: Krishnan R=\r\namaswamy, Antonio de Nicolas and Aditi Banerjee). It has 29 scholarly artic=\r\nles organized in 4 sections.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Perverted scholars with perverted anti-H=\r\nindu agendas that look down upon India and Hinduism with a colonial viewpoi=\r\nnt have conducted perverted researches in the name of academic freedom at t=\r\nhe religious studies departments of western universities, published them an=\r\nd gained name and fame, trampling the sacred in the process. Crying foul or=\r\n getting frustrated with this will not improve the situation or solve the p=\r\nroblem. Interested religious scholars have to firmly and patiently crtique =\r\nthese works in the same academic style, in order to reclaim the rightful pl=\r\nace for Hinduism.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Several papers in this book do exactly that. They t=\r\nake specific works by western scholars and rebut them quite well and show h=\r\now they are fallacious, hasty, nonsensical or sometimes downright manipulat=\r\nive or filled with lies.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; I will just give a=\r\nn example of the offensive work that was rebutted in this book. [Warning: T=\r\nhose who are sensitive to offensive writings should skip the next three par=\r\nagraphs.]\n&gt;  \n&gt; Jeffrey Kripal from Univ of Chicago visited Ramakrishna Mis=\r\nsion in West Bengal and did research on Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. Several pe=\r\nople there enthusiastically helped him in the researches. In the end, what =\r\nhe produced is utterly nonsensical and filled with lies. He published his P=\r\nhD dissertation without showing it to Ramakrishna Mission people to check f=\r\nor factual or linguistic inaccuracies. Ramakrishna mission people found out=\r\n about what he produced only years later, after his book &quot;Kali&#39;s Child&quot; bas=\r\ned on the PhD dissertation won great acclaim in the West. He won an award a=\r\nt the Americal Academy of Religion for that book, landed a job at Harvard a=\r\nnd his book was sadly mentioned in the Encyclopedia Britannica as the *numb=\r\ner one* choice for learning about Ramakrishna.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In the book, he portra=\r\nyed Ramakrishna as a sexually perverted person, a homosexual and a pedophil=\r\ne. He did not know Bengali or Hindi or Sanskrit well and did not take help =\r\nfrom any Bengali people at the Mission for this work. He used his own fault=\r\ny translations, willful distortions and manipulation of sources to arrive a=\r\nt sensational (and damning) conclusions. For example, he translated a word =\r\nthat means &quot;lap&quot; as &quot;genitals&quot;, in the context of Swami Brahmananda (spirit=\r\nual son of Ramakrishna and a young boy then) sitting in Ramakrishna&#39;s lap. =\r\nHe translated a word that means &quot;touching softly&quot; as &quot;uncontrollably rubbin=\r\ng sandalpaste on the penises of boys&quot;.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Even in places where there was=\r\n no material to mis-translate, he simply speculated! For example, he specul=\r\nated on the meeting of Totapuri and Ramakrishna, in which the naaga sadhu (=\r\nnaked ascetic) Totapuri taught advaita vedanta to Ramakrishna and made him =\r\ngo beyond Mother Kali and experience nirvikalpa samadhi: &quot;What it must have=\r\n been like for Ramakrishna, a homosexually oriented man, to be shut away fo=\r\nr days in a small hut with another, stark-naked man. Vedanta instruction or=\r\n not, it was this man&#39;s nudity, and more especially, his penis, that normal=\r\nly caught Ramakrishna&#39;s attention. How could it not?&quot; Please note that he i=\r\ns not referring to any source and mis-translating it, but simply speculatin=\r\ng based on his perverted agenda!\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; If you see=\r\n the book, you will see many examples of such pseudo-scholarship driven by =\r\nheinous agendas. It is a fact that many perverted people under asuric influ=\r\nences make their livelihood, money and fame lying and spreading falsehoods =\r\nabout Hinduism, Hindu deities and Hindu saints.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Those who are not inc=\r\nlined to fight a dharma yuddha against this may ignore this and go on doing=\r\n their sadhana. After all, if enough people do sadhana to strengthen sanata=\r\nna dharma, this kind of things will automatically weaken. However, some sch=\r\nolars engaging these pseudo-scholars academically is really required on the=\r\n ground. We need to give our encouragement to the pioneers who are doing th=\r\nis important scholarly rebuttal.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free Jyot=\r\nish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; Free &quot;Do I=\r\nt Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;            =\r\n         http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;        Films that make a differen=\r\nce: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;        Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;     Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/=\r\nJyotishWritings\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
