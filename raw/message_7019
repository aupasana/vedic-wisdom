Sarvam SriKrishnaarpanam\n\nRegards\nK=\r\nK\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have reflected on this more and consolidated=\r\n this further. Here is a \n&gt; fuller understanding.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; One who thinks &quot;I am experiencing this&quot; or &quot;I am doing this&quot; is bound.=\r\n \n&gt; One who gives up experiencership and doership and understands the natur=\r\ne \n&gt; of experiences and actions is free.\n&gt; \n&gt; Through vibrations that arose=\r\n in Self, various entities arose (Fire, \n&gt; Wind, Sun, Moon etc). It is thos=\r\ne entities who pervade each being and \n&gt; engage in experiences and actions.=\r\n But one is under the delusion that &quot;I \n&gt; am experiencing & I am acting&quot; an=\r\nd gets bound. When one realizes the \n&gt; true doers of various experiences & =\r\nactions, one is free.\n&gt; \n&gt; The gross, subtle and astral realms of existence=\r\n (bhur, bhuvar and \n&gt; suvar) are controlled by Fire, Wind and Sun. For any =\r\nmovement of prana \n&gt; in those realms, they are experiencers & doers and not=\r\n &quot;I&quot;. The &quot;I&quot; is \n&gt; untouched by those experiences and actions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then w=\r\ne have the mind, which is the window through which we are aware of \n&gt; all t=\r\nhe realms of existence. It is controlled by Moon. Any experiences \n&gt; or act=\r\nions arising in mind are experienced or done by Moon and not by \n&gt; &quot;I&quot;.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Then we have destiny, which is the agent through which one&#39;s past karmas =\r\n\n&gt; (actions) are remembered and brought to fructification. It is controlled=\r\n \n&gt; by stars (nakshatras). Any experience or action arising through destiny=\r\n \n&gt; is experienced or done by nakshatras and not by &quot;I&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then we have =\r\nindriyas, which are the agents through which we connect to \n&gt; the world, i.=\r\ne. perceive it and modify it. They are controlled by \n&gt; Parjanya. Though Pa=\r\nrjanya is translated as a raincloud, it is from the \n&gt; root &quot;pR^ic&quot;, which =\r\nmeans &quot;to join&quot;. Parjanya shows connecting with \n&gt; others, which is what in=\r\ndriyas do. Parjanya is also used as a synonym \n&gt; for Indra, who owns indriy=\r\nas. So indriyas are controlled by Parjanya and \n&gt; any experiences or action=\r\ns arising though senses are experienced or done \n&gt; by Parjanya and not by &quot;=\r\nI&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then we have time, which is the agent through which we experience =\r\n\n&gt; memories and notions or now, earlier and later. It is controlled by \n&gt; S=\r\namvatsara or Time personified. Any experience or action arising through \n&gt; =\r\nmemories or expectations or other notions of time, is experienced or \n&gt; don=\r\ne by Samvatsara and not by &quot;I&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Bottomline: W=\r\nhen one experiences or acts using gross, subtle and astral \n&gt; bodies, mind,=\r\n destiny, indriyas and notion of time, one gets bound by \n&gt; thinking that &quot;=\r\nI am experiencing&quot; or &quot;I am doing&quot;. Instead, by realizing \n&gt; that &quot;I&quot; am no=\r\nt experiencing or doing, but Agni, Vayu, Surya, Chandrama, \n&gt; Nakshatras, P=\r\narjanya and Time, who arose when a vibration arose in Self, \n&gt; are experien=\r\ncing and acting through one&#39;s gross, subtle and astral \n&gt; bodies, mind, des=\r\ntiny, indriyas and notion of time, respectively, one \n&gt; becomes established=\r\n in Self. By knowing the true experiencer and actor \n&gt; of each experience a=\r\nnd action, one is freed from the false notion that \n&gt; &quot;I am experiencing&quot; a=\r\nnd &quot;I am acting&quot; and becomes free.\n&gt; \n&gt; This fuller understanding came in a=\r\nn inspired moment and I am unlikely \n&gt; to be able to refine it further for =\r\nnow.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Les=\r\nsons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam a=\r\nnd Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;    =\r\n   Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spiritua=\r\nlity: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: htt=\r\np://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;                       Twitter =\r\nID: @homam108\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dinesh asked on Twitter about the meaning =\r\nof Vedic chant &quot;Mantra \n&gt; &gt; Pushpam&quot;:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; @dineshnambisan @homam108 @s=\r\nandhyopasaka Can one of you gents shed \n&gt; &gt;&gt; some light on\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Mantra Push=\r\npam? Awesome chant to listen to, and seems to have lots of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; water\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n references, yet is typically chanted at the conclusion of a \n&gt; &gt;&gt; yagna/ho=\r\nma, no?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You can refer to the following website to see the tradition=\r\nally given \n&gt; &gt; meaning:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://www.celextel.org/vedichymns/mantrap=\r\nushpam.html\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For example, a couple of verses are taken to mean:\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Fire is the source of water,\n&gt; &gt; He who knows this,\n&gt; &gt; Becomes establ=\r\nished in himself,\n&gt; &gt; Water is the source of fire,\n&gt; &gt; He who knows this,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Becomes established in himself.\n&gt; &gt; He who knows the source of water,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Becomes established in himself&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Then repeat the same by replacing=\r\n fire with wind, burning Sun, Moon, \n&gt; &gt; stars, clouds, year etc.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; D=\r\noes it make any sense to you?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The word =\r\n&quot;Apas&quot; is used in the 4th line above (with long vowel &quot;A&quot;), \n&gt; &gt; while the =\r\nword &quot;apas&quot; (with short vowel &quot;a&quot;) is used in other places. \n&gt; &gt; This happe=\r\nns consistently in all verses. Though both are translated as \n&gt; &gt; water by =\r\nmany people, my take is that they are different.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The word ap or apa=\r\ns means &quot;actions&quot; in addition to water. In fact, it \n&gt; &gt; is used in that me=\r\naning in many places in Veda. The word Apas means \n&gt; &gt; inspired or equanimo=\r\nus actions. According to some, it means riligious \n&gt; &gt; ceremonies also, but=\r\n note that a religious ceremony is supposed to be \n&gt; &gt; an inspired and bala=\r\nnced action.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In my view, apas above means action and Apas means an =\r\nequanimous \n&gt; &gt; action, i.e. action where the doer is established in Self.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The physical, mental and spiritual real=\r\nms are controlled by Fire, Wind \n&gt; &gt; and Sun gods. Fire, the transformer, c=\r\nreates the physical reality by \n&gt; &gt; processing the elements through the phy=\r\nsical senses and transforming \n&gt; &gt; them into physical experiences. Wind, th=\r\ne mover, creates the mental \n&gt; &gt; reality to by moving the notions and conce=\r\npts in the mind. Sun, the \n&gt; &gt; shiner, shows the spiritual reality by throw=\r\ning light on the divinity \n&gt; &gt; in everything. That is why we make aahutis t=\r\no fire, wind and Sun in \n&gt; &gt; uttarangam of a homam.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Whene Mantra pu=\r\nshpam refers to those three, it is saying that one who \n&gt; &gt; realizes that a=\r\nctions arise in the physical, mental & spiritual realms \n&gt; &gt; of one&#39;s being=\r\n, is established in Self. In other words, &quot;I&quot; am not \n&gt; &gt; doing actions, bu=\r\nt actions arise in parts of my being, which are \n&gt; &gt; repsented by fire, win=\r\nd and Sun. Next, it is saying that one who \n&gt; &gt; realizes that equanimous ac=\r\ntion arising in Self is the source of all \n&gt; &gt; these realms of being (physi=\r\ncal, mental and spiritual), is established \n&gt; &gt; in Self.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In other w=\r\nords, equanimous actions arising in Self give rise to \n&gt; &gt; various aspects =\r\nof one&#39;s being. And actions arise in various aspects \n&gt; &gt; of one&#39;s being. O=\r\nne who realizes this and does not entertain notions \n&gt; &gt; that &quot;I am doing, =\r\nI did this ritual&quot; etc will be established in Self.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This the main p=\r\nurport.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
