When one stands in a river, a really big source of water, that is exactly what one does. One takes water in the palms from the river and drops it back into the river.\n \nHowever, if you have a smaller source of water (like a small bowl), it is a good idea to drop the used water in a separate bowl or plate. Used water should be a smaller portion of the entire water in the bowl, which is true if you are doing it in a river.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- aashish rai &lt;raiaashish@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaskar Narasimhaji,\n&gt; I have a query regarding Tarpanam. Last year while doing tarpanam our pandit here has used a huge brass Bowl. We need to take water from the Bowl in  our both palms and drop it into the same bowl  with hand gestures as mentioned by you. So instead of water being poured from pot into hand and same water from Bowl was used again and again. Is this Ok or against the rule?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Aashish\n\n\n"}}
