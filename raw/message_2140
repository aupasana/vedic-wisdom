(talking of spiritual perspec=\r\ntive here).\nit is not at all convincing to think that he developed pride, b=\r\necame harsh and haughty, started controlling Ramakrishna, started taking mo=\r\nney from visitors, started scolding Thakur etc...and that is why he suffere=\r\nd. Thakur, who spiritually transformed many lives, could have easily transf=\r\normed Hridu. why he didn&#39;t do that? why the poor Hridu got trapped in Shadr=\r\nipu so badly even staying so close to Thakur? Even Hazara Mahashaya was fin=\r\nally saved. where is the compassion of thakur when we see Hridaynath&#39;s late=\r\nr life?\n\nany thoughts?\n\nYours,\n\n\n\n\n"}}
