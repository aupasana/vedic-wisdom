There are patha-bedhas\neven in veda. Or, for now\nare you only saying that the pratishakya-s are all corrupted.\n\n(b) on what basis is correct pronounciation being re-inferred. I guess\nthe pratishakya is out, and\nwe are back to the panini-shiksha-sutras & such. But even here, how\ndoes one interpret the\nsimplest sutras like &quot;uccairudAttaH&quot;.\n\n(c) current rig-veda pronounciation is generally &quot;better&quot; from\nsanskrit viewpoint compared to other\nshakhas. But, in the most prized shrouta karmas, it is the\nsama-gana-vikriti that is given much\nimportance, even though most of its mantras are nothing but rig-veda\nmantras. What is your view\nwhen it comes to pronounciation of sama-veda? Because from a sanskrit\npoint of view, it is rather\n&quot;interesting&quot;.\n\n(d) chandas-shastra in veda does not seem to be so simple. There are\nplenty of instances of mantras\nwhich are said to be in one meter . . . which don&#39;t seem to be in that\nmeter at all. Some learned scholars\nare of the opinion that there are several differrent chandas all of\nwhich go by one name, particularly in veda.\nSecondly, some opine that the definition of laghu & guru are actually\ndifferent, and letters being alpa-prAna /\nmahA-prAna etc also factor into the counting of letters.\n\nWhat is your view of traditional chandas-shAstra. The reason I ask is\nbefore we claim that traditional pronounciation\nis flawed in some cases (using chandas as the reason), one has to be\nvery confident in their understanding of\nchandas shastra.\n\n&gt; In fact, we have a lot of people who can\n&gt; memorize and repeat Veda mantras, but very few who can actually &quot;experience&quot;\n&gt; a mantra.\n\nAnd efforts towards this goal are laudable.\n\ndhanyo.asmi,\n\n        ajit\n\njayatu jayatu samskRitam. jayatu jayatu manukulam.\n\n"}}
