Though I intended to type out a detailed mail with my indep=\r\nendent interpretation of all the verses in that chapter, it is a big task a=\r\nnd I am unable to find time for it.\n \nFortunately, I chanced upon a nice we=\r\nbsite giving the Hindi translation (including word-by-word meanings) of all=\r\n the four Vedas by Swami Dayananda Saraswati. Though not at the same depth =\r\nas Aurobindo&#39;s commentary (which was limited to a few verses), his exhausti=\r\nve work is quite good.\n \nIf you are comfortable with Hindi language, please=\r\n use this website for commentary on Vedas in future. It is far far far far =\r\nbetter than the English commentary on the site you referred to. I checked o=\r\nut some sample verses and quite pleased with the commentary. This work is s=\r\nimilar in wavelength to my own thinking and I am comfortable recommending t=\r\nhis. Though it does not internalize enough in several places, it is not dum=\r\nb and silly like other internet commentaries.\n \nIn the case of RV 10.95 tha=\r\nt you enquired about, Swami Dayananda Saraswati interpreted Pururava as a c=\r\nloud containing water and Urvashi as vidyut (electricity, i.e. lightening).=\r\n This is quite intelligent and acceptable to me, though my view expressed i=\r\nn the mail below internalizes it further.\n \nThe website is\n \nhttp://www.ary=\r\nasamajjamnagar.org/\n \nClick the link on the right for Rigveda bhashya (bhas=\r\nhya=3Dcommentary).

Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne in\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/2138:\n \n&gt; Namaste,\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; Veda is for self-realization. Veda deals with various aspects of dual=\r\n and non-dual self. There are hardly any good translations or commentaries =\r\non Veda in today&#39;s world. Aurobindo&#39;s commentary (on a small number of riks=\r\n) is the only intelligent commentary I have come across.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Just as Adi =\r\nSankara devoted his life to commenting on some Upanishads, someone like him=\r\n needs to come and devote life to commenting on Veda, if we are to have a g=\r\nood commentary. Actually, Vivekananda commented on his last day (1902 July =\r\n4) on the commentaries on Veda. He had his disciples read a verse from Sukl=\r\na Yajur Veda, read the commentary by Mahidhara and said that Mahidhara&#39;s in=\r\nterpretation did not appeal to his mind. He connected the verse to some lat=\r\ner day tantra concepts and wished that his disciples would make an attempt =\r\nat fresh independent interpretation of mantras from Veda, as the existing c=\r\nommentaries were not good. This was one of the last few desires expressed b=\r\ny Vivekananda before he gave up his body.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Aurobindo said that he had =\r\na vision of Vivekananda in his prison cell and that Vivekananda explained s=\r\nome things to him. It is interesting that Aurobindo came up with a sublime =\r\ncommentary on some Vedic verses in later years.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; Do not trust any commentary on Veda. More so the one at the website yo=\r\nu mentioned. I checked out a few verses. The translations given by them are=\r\n usually quite silly. Ignore that website.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\nCommenting on a verse from Veda is different. It is not merely an intellect=\r\nual activity requiring scholarship and logical thinking.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I cannot giv=\r\ne a complete sense of what this verse is saying (will try later), but can g=\r\nive an overall big picture first. The verses around this verse alternate be=\r\ntween having Pururava as the rishi (seer) and Urvashi as the devata (deity)=\r\n and having Urvashi as the rishi (deity) and Pururava as the devata (deity)=\r\n. This is an exchange between Pururava and Urvashi as they pursued each oth=\r\ner. You can read various puranic stories about Pururava, the great king fro=\r\nm Chandra vamsha, and Urvashi, the beautiful apsara (celestial nymph). They=\r\n were attracted to each other and lived together on earth. They are personi=\r\nfications of some qualities inside us.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Urvashi comes from ura and vas=\r\nha. It means one who has the power to control and pull the heart. Urvashi i=\r\ns personification of the attraction that pulls one&#39;s heart towards various =\r\nobjects in the field of duality. As a sadhaka does great tapascharya and st=\r\narts to overcome duality, Urvashi is sent to test one. Urvashi successfully=\r\n seducing a sadhaka and disturbing his tapascharya means that the sadhaka s=\r\nuccumbed to the power of attraction that pulled his heart towards objects a=\r\nnd his heart desired something.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Pururava means a crying a lot or cryi=\r\nng majestically. He is a personification of the emotional nature and compas=\r\nsion within us. No wonder he is a king in the Chandra vamsha. The solar and=\r\n lunar lineages that are popular in the scriptures have to do with the sola=\r\nr and lunar channels - Pingala and Ida (respectively). Ida nadi is the chan=\r\nnel of emotions, intuition, feeling, compassion etc. So Pururava is from th=\r\nat lineage.\n&gt;  \n&gt; While everyone is charmed by Urvashi - the power of attra=\r\nction that binds one&#39;s heart, Urvashi herself was charmed by Pururava, the =\r\nmajestic and noble king. Pururava rescued Urvashi from a demon once. The ma=\r\njestic and noble quality of compassion saves the power of attraction from h=\r\naving to combine with meaner motives. One&#39;s heart can be pulled towards var=\r\nious objects out of the spirit of self-gratification (a demon) or out of ki=\r\nndness and compassion (Pururava). When compassion arises in one&#39;s heart, th=\r\nen the heart&#39;s attraction to others is driven by compassion rather than the=\r\n spirit of self-gratification.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The verses you referred to are a dialo=\r\ng between the personification of compassion and personification of the powe=\r\nr of attraction that pulls one&#39;s heart towards various objects. This whole =\r\nseries of verses has to be interpreted in abstract and internalized terms. =\r\nIt is not a commentary on men and women at all.\n&gt;  \n&gt; More later..\n&gt;  \n&gt; Be=\r\nst regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.o=\r\nrg/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpa=\r\nna\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotis=\r\nh lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software=\r\n (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) web=\r\nsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ---------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From:=\r\n rajarshi nandy \n&gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Monday, Ju=\r\nly 13, 2009 10:54 PM\n&gt;   Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Meaning of one verse from =\r\nRig Veda\n&gt;         Dear Narasimhaji and others\n&gt; \n&gt;         Can you kindly =\r\nexplain the meaning of the following verse from the Rig Veda:\n&gt; \n&gt;         =\r\npur=C5=ABravo m=C4=81 m=E1=B9=9Bth=C4=81 m=C4=81 pra papto m=C4=81 tv=C4=81=\r\n v=E1=B9=9Bk=C4=81so a=C5=9Biv=C4=81sa uk=E1=B9=A3an | \n&gt;         na vai st=\r\nrai=E1=B9=87=C4=81ni sakhy=C4=81ni santi s=C4=81l=C4=81v=E1=B9=9Bk=C4=81=E1=\r\n=B9=87=C4=81=E1=B9=83h=E1=B9=9Bday=C4=81nyet=C4=81 || (Rig Veda Book 10, Hy=\r\nm XCV)\n&gt; \n&gt;         http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rvsan/rv10095.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n        The english translation provided is as follows:\n&gt; \n&gt;         15 Nay=\r\n, do not die, Pur=C5=ABravas, nor vanish: let not the evil-omened wolves de=\r\nvour thee.\n&gt;         With women there can be no lasting friendship: hearts =\r\nof hyenas are the hearts of women.\n&gt; \n&gt;         http://www.sacred-texts.com=\r\n/hin/rigveda/rv10095.htm\n&gt; \n&gt;         Is this translation correct?
