It was during this period that he was joined=\r\n\nby a number of those disciples who were to remain with him permanently,\nth=\r\nese included Viswanatha Swami, Ramaswami Pillai and Kunju Swami. His\nyounge=\r\nr brother Nagasundaram also joined the Ashram. When Alagammal died in\n1922,=\r\n she was buried at the foot of the hill. Shortly thereafter the time at\nSka=\r\nndashram came to an end, as the Maharshi and his followers moved to\nsettle =\r\ndown at her burial site, and Ramanashram,where Sri Ramana was to\nremain unt=\r\nil his death, came into being.\n\nAs a result of several deaths in her family=\r\n and the difficult circumstances\nof her life Alagammal finally felt that sh=\r\ne should spend the remaining years\nof her life with her second son. Nagaswa=\r\nmi, her eldest son, had died in\n1900. Soon after her visit to Ramana her br=\r\nother-in-law Nelliappa Iyer had\ndied and then also her daughter-in-law Mang=\r\nalam. The house in Tiruchuli had\nbeen sold to cover debts. Nelliappa Iyer h=\r\nad left the family in difficult\ncircumstances.\n\nIn early 1916 Alagammal set=\r\n off for Tiruvannamalai. As she did not know\nwhether she would be allowed t=\r\no stay with Ramana in the Virupaksha Cave she\nmoved in with Echammal, who e=\r\nach day brought a meal up to the cave. But\nafter some time she felt the urg=\r\nent need to stay with her son. The\ncommunity, however, did not want to see =\r\nany change in the established Ashram\nroutine.\n\nWithout consulting Ramana th=\r\ney declared with one voice that under no\ncircumstances should women be allo=\r\nwed to live in the cave.Although the other\nwomen argued that the mother sho=\r\nuld be permitted to do so as she was now too\nold to climb the hill each\nday=\r\n, they remained unmoved. When Sri Ramana came to hear about the matter he\na=\r\nt first kept silent. Alagammal stood there unhappy and despairing and\nwante=\r\nd to go, when Ramana, deeply moved, took her hand and said, =E2=80=9CCome l=\r\net\nus go, if not here we can stay somewhere else, come.=E2=80=9D Fearful th=\r\nat he may\nindeed go away they all immediately changed their view and Alagam=\r\nmal moved\ninto the Ashram.\n\nAt the Virupaksha Cave there was often not enou=\r\ngh water or at times none at\nall. But further up the hill there was a water=\r\nfall under which the members\nof the community took their daily bath. Alagam=\r\nmal,however, was too old to\nclimb up to the spring. Ramana told how he used=\r\n to fetch the water for her\n=E2=80=98bath=E2=80=99 from this spring in two =\r\nkamandalams, =E2=80=9CI used to bring water in both\nof them, carrying one i=\r\nn each hand. She used to sit down wearing a small\ncloth and I used to pour =\r\nthe water over her head just as we do abhishikam\nover an idol. That is how =\r\nshe used to have her bath.Someone used to wash her\ncloth and bring it back.=\r\n That was all. If water was brought in those two\nkamandalams all her requir=\r\nements used to be met.=E2=80=9D\n\nKandaswami, one of Sri Ramana=E2=80=99s di=\r\nsciples, eventually found this all too\ntiresome. Also, because of the growi=\r\nng number of disciples,the Virupaksha\nCave was becoming crowded. He therefo=\r\nre decided to look for another place to\nstay, where they could live more co=\r\nmfortably and he thought that the best\nthing would be to settle down at the=\r\n spring. Once Ramana had given his\nagreement, he started work, cleared away=\r\n the undergrowth, cacti and trees,\nremoved the rocks and started building t=\r\nhe Ashram. He also planted a garden\nwith coconut trees. Ramana named the ne=\r\nw Ashram after him. Kanda is the\nTamil name for Skanda, and so the new lodg=\r\ning was named =E2=80=98Skandashram=E2=80=99. It is\none of the most enchanti=\r\nng places on the hill with an impressive view of the\nArunachaleswara temple=\r\n and the whole town.\n\nThe daily routine at Skandashram was subject to stric=\r\nt regulation.At four\no=E2=80=99clock in the morning Alagammal would rise an=\r\nd sing devotional songs, while\nthe other community members meditated.Then A=\r\nkshara Mana Malai (The Marital\nGarland of Letters) was recited. Afterwards =\r\nRamana took his bath. To brush\nhis teeth he sat on a big stone slab on the =\r\neastern side of Skandashram. He\ncontinued to do this even when the weather =\r\nwas cool, nobody could make him\ngive this up. Exactly why he did so was onl=\r\ny discovered later. An old woman\nwas in the habit of coming up daily for da=\r\nrshan. When her health would no\nlonger allow her to climb up the hill, she =\r\ncould see Ramana from her house\nwhen he brushed his teeth at this place. He=\r\n knew how important this was for\nher, so he always sat there, irrespective =\r\nof the weather.\n\nAt eight there was rasam and rice for breakfast. After thi=\r\ns the Ashram\ncommunity sat outside. Some devotees read, others meditated.Th=\r\ne atmosphere\nwas very peaceful. Occasionally Ramana answered the questions =\r\nof devotees\nand visitors.\n\nIn the evening Akshara Mana Malai was recited ag=\r\nain.\n\nWhen Alagammal moved into Skandashram, food was meagre and depended u=\r\npon\nwhatever visitors and devotees brought. Sometimes the food was deliciou=\r\ns and\nthere was more than enough for everybody, at other times there was mu=\r\nch less\nand sometimes nothing at all.\n\nSoon Alagammal started cooking regul=\r\narly and took charge of running the\nhousehold. She would wander about the h=\r\nill and bring back things that she\nfound there. She was an excellent and im=\r\naginative cook and liked to spoil\nthe devotees with a variety of delicious =\r\ndishes, using the ingredients she\nhad somehow managed to find.\n\nDuring her =\r\nlast years Alagammal still had some lessons to learn.When she\nfirst came to=\r\n live with Ramana he did not call her =E2=80=98Amma=E2=80=99 (mother).\nSome=\r\ntimes he would ignore her and not answer her when she spoke to him,\nwhilst =\r\nat the same time paying attention to everybody else. If she\ncomplained he w=\r\nould say to her, =E2=80=9CAll women are my mothers, not only you.=E2=80=9D\n=\r\nThis was very hurtful for her. At first this would often make her cry, but\n=\r\nlater she learned to give up the possessiveness she felt towards her son an=\r\nd\nto overcome any feelings of superiority she may have had at being the mot=\r\nher\nof the great Swami.\n\nIf Alagammal were to think that this thing or that=\r\n thing were needed, Ramana\nwould say to her, =E2=80=9CMother, if you want b=\r\nodily comfort, go to the other son;\nif you want mental comfort you stay her=\r\ne.=E2=80=9D\n\nAlagammal understood and became accustomed to the life of priv=\r\nation at the\nAshram. She never thought of leaving.\n\nAlagammal wanted her yo=\r\nunger son Nagasundaram, whose wife had died, to come\nto live with them in t=\r\nhe Ashram. His sister Alamelu had taken over the\nupbringing of his small so=\r\nn Venkataraman (Venkatoo), so he was free and\nunattached. She sent one of R=\r\namana=E2=80=99s companions to Nagasundaram to tell him\nof her wish. In 1918=\r\n Nagasundaram left his job and came to Tiruvannamalai.\nFirst he lived at a =\r\nfriend=E2=80=99s house and climbed up to the Ashram each day.\nThen he took =\r\na vow of renunciation and adopted the ochre robe of a\nsannyasin. His name w=\r\nas changed to Niranjanandaswami,but he was generally\ncalled =E2=80=98Chinna=\r\nswami=E2=80=99 (little Swami), because he was the brother of the big\nSwami.=\r\n At first he used to go to town every day begging, later he gave it up\nas t=\r\nhere was by now enough for all to eat in the Ashram itself.\n\nAlagammal=E2=\r\n=80=99s only desire was to be with Ramana at the moment of her death.\nWhen =\r\nher daughter Alamelu invited her to the ceremony to open her new house,\nshe=\r\n declined, fearing that she would be unable to return to her son if she\nbec=\r\name sick there. She said to Ramana, =E2=80=9CEven if you were to throw away=\r\n my\ndead body in these thorny bushes I do not mind but I must end this life=\r\n in\nyour arms.=E2=80=9D\n\nWhen Alagammal felt that her end was nearing, she =\r\ncalled both her sons to\nher side, placed Chinnaswami=E2=80=99s hand in the =\r\nhand of Ramana and said to the\nlatter one, =E2=80=9CThis boy does not know =\r\nwhat is right and what is wrong. Don=E2=80=99t\nlet him go away from you. Ke=\r\nep a watchful eye on him. This is my last wish.=E2=80=9D\n\n\nOn 19th May 1922=\r\n Alagammal=E2=80=99s condition became critical. Kunju Swami reports,\n=E2=80=\r\n=9CAfter his morning walk, Sri Bhagavan went into mother=E2=80=99s room and=\r\n sat beside\nher. He ate his lunch there itself and was sitting beside her a=\r\nll the time.\nWhen he noticed her struggling for breath, he put his right ha=\r\nnd on her\nchest. She became a little restful after a while. The time of mot=\r\nher=E2=80=99s\nliberation was drawing near. Sri Bhagavan put one of his hand=\r\ns on her head\nand another on her chest and sat quietly.=E2=80=9DThe devotee=\r\ns had started to recite\nthe Vedas, Akshara Mana Malai and the name of Ram s=\r\nimultaneously in three\ngroups, to silence down her mind. At 8 p.m. Alagamma=\r\nl died.\n\nIn the meantime Alamelu had arrived along with her husband, her ne=\r\nphew\nVenkatoo and some devotees. Although it had been decided that Alagamma=\r\nl=E2=80=99s\nburial should be a quiet affair, a huge crowd of Maharshi=E2=80=\r\n=99s devotees had\ncome, bringing fruit, flowers\nand coconuts. A Shiva linga=\r\nm was erected over the grave, which, at the\nsuggestion of Ganapati Muni, wa=\r\ns named Mathrubhutheswara (God in the form of\nthe mother).\n\nSource: Ramana =\r\nMaharshi: His Life A biography by Gabriele Ebert\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =\r\n=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =\r\n =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000325560f9e137a92047f9ef811\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana;line-height:16px&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Sri Ramana spent the years 1916 to 1922 wi=\r\nth his mother Alagammal and the small community at Skandashram.=C2=A0&lt;/span=\r\n&gt;It was during this period that he was joined by a number of those disciple=\r\ns who were to remain with him permanently, these included Viswanatha Swami,=\r\n Ramaswami Pillai and Kunju Swami.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Hi=\r\ns younger brother Nagasundaram also joined the Ashram.

At f=\r\nirst he used to go to town every day begging, later he gave it up as there =\r\nwas by now enough for all to eat in the Ashram itself.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;Alagammal=E2=80=99s only desire was to be with Raman=\r\na at the moment of her death. When her daughter Alamelu invited her to the =\r\nceremony to open her new house, she declined, fearing that she would be una=\r\nble to return to her son if she became sick there. She said to Ramana, =E2=\r\n=80=9CEven if you were to throw away my dead body in these thorny bushes I =\r\ndo not mind but I must end this life in your arms.=E2=80=9D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;When Alagammal felt that her end was near=\r\ning, she called both her sons to her side, placed Chinnaswami=E2=80=99s han=\r\nd in the hand of Ramana and said to the latter one, =E2=80=9CThis boy does =\r\nnot know what is right and what is wrong.

He ate his lunch there itself and was sitting beside her a=\r\nll the time. When he noticed her struggling for breath, he put his right ha=\r\nnd on her chest. She became a little restful after a while. The time of mot=\r\nher=E2=80=99s liberation was drawing near.
