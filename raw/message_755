I have been perusing this forum with great\ni=\r\nnterest. I have a question. If anybody, especially Narasimha Ji, has\na spar=\r\ne moment to answer I would really appreciate it.\n\n Personally, I do not lik=\r\ne to do Japa with a Mala, as I feel this\nmakes the whole process very mecha=\r\nnical and preoccupies my mind with\nissues such as not crossing the Meru, ha=\r\nndling the Mala properly\netc..I find my mind dwelling on these issues rathe=\r\nr than the mantra\nitself. \n\n1. Does Japa have to be done with a Mala?\n\n1. W=\r\nhat are the ramifications of crossing the Meru bead?\n\nI know some scripture=\r\ns say Japa done with Mala (in my case Vishnu\nmantra done with Tulsi Mala) i=\r\ns more effective then japa done without\nMala. \n\n2. Is this meant to be take=\r\nn seriously? \n\n3. What should one concentrate when reciting Japa for purpos=\r\ne of\nremedial measures? The mantra, the devata, one&#39;s goals?\n\nThank you so =\r\nmuch.\n\n\n"}}
