I was writing in a flow and never\nchecked what I wrote. Kindly pardon suc=\r\nh errors and read through them.\nAs they say, &quot;Bhavnayoko samjho!&quot;.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; =\r\n=C2\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; During the day time, we roamed around shooting at different pla=\r\nces. In\nthis 3 days we never visited any of the temples in Kasi. I asked hi=\r\nm,\n&quot;What about the temples? Won&#39;t we visit them?&quot;. Manish retorted\nimmediat=\r\nely, &quot;=C2 Aren&#39;t we=C2 going to the most powerful temple in\nKasi every nigh=\r\nt?&quot;! I silently agreed. This is something about Manish I\nhave observed. He =\r\nrarely enters temples or standard places of worship,\nbut suddenly he might =\r\nsee a small roadside temple and stand and stare\nfor sometimes, even do a pr=\r\nanam and then remark, &quot;There is something\nhere.&quot;\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; During evening we =\r\nwent to visit the Kinnaram Ashram. Kinnaram Baba was\na Aghori who lived in =\r\nKasi=C2 during the 16th century. The place is\ncalled Aghor-sthal. Before en=\r\ntering Manish bought some bel leaves. As we\nwalked inside the Ashram, Manis=\r\nh became silent, then said there are\nstrong energies in here. Inside we med=\r\nitated for sometime, Manish\ndid=C2  pranam=C2 at the samadhi of Baba Bhagwa=\r\nn Ram who was the 11th\nhead of the Ashram. Baba Bhagwan Ram had entered Nir=\r\nvikalpa Samadhi\nwhile meditating for 3 continuous days at the Manikarnika S=\r\namshan.=C2 \nManish, on being=C2 questioned, said that many sadhanas have be=\r\nen done\nhere in this place for long by people with no mundane desires.\nTher=\r\nefore, the energies are strong here. While looking around the Ashram\nwe fou=\r\nnd some quotations which were written in small wooden boards.\nManish called=\r\n Arunisha and me and pointed to one quotation. Translated\nto English, it re=\r\nad, &quot;If you have to give your head off to get a\nsadguru, you\n&gt; have=C2 got =\r\nit cheap&quot;.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; By 8 PM we sat for dinner. We used to have early dinners=\r\n, so that we\nhad sufficient time before going to the samshan. Ideally you s=\r\nhould have\nan empty stomach while performing any sadhana to get the best ef=\r\nfects.\nThe amount of fire in the body is fixed. There is one that digests f=\r\nood\n- Jathara Agni. One that digests ideas/concepts/experiences - Bhuta Agn=\r\ni\n(existential fire) which exists in the subtle body. It is the second\nwhic=\r\nh must increase in order for one to &quot;digest&quot; various\nexperiences/ideas/etc.=\r\n It can only increase when the Jathara Agni is\nless, i.e. you do not have a=\r\n full stomach. When we are extremely focused\non something and working inten=\r\ntly on the same, we forget food, we do not\nfeel hungry. This is due to the =\r\nincrease in Bhuta Agni and decrease in\nJathara Agni.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; As we sat eati=\r\nng our food and talking on different topics, we\ndiscussed history.The conve=\r\nrsation mentioned here is a thread picked up\nfrom an earlier conversation t=\r\nhat we (Manish, Arunisha and=C2 me) had\nbefore coming to Kasi.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Mani=\r\nsh said, &quot;It is the same set of=C2 souls who come back=C2 again\nand again i=\r\nn different bodies and personalities at different times,\nwho=C2 are respons=\r\nible for this land. There was Chadragupta and\nChanakya, there was Prithvira=\r\nj, there was Akbar, Shankaracharya,\nRamakrishna etc.&quot; He continued, &quot;They c=\r\nan come as kings, yogis, or any\nother form which is necessary for them to a=\r\nccomplish their dharma. And\ntheir dharma is connected to this land=C2 which=\r\n we call India=C2\ntoday.This land is connected to the Rishis. This is Rishi=\r\n bhoomi. And\nRishis sent people when needed.=C2 Prithviraj made one mistake=\r\n, of\npardoning Ghori. Imagine what happened to that woman who made\nPrithivi=\r\nraj disobey his Guru?&quot;.I silently contemplated her fate.=C2\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; &quot;One ve=\r\nry senior Rishi has decided to=C2 change this land back to a\nRishi bhoomi. =\r\nAnd so shall it happen.=C2 Ved=C2 Dharma will be re\nestablished here along =\r\nthe length and breadth. Nothing, however powerful\nor mightly, be it an indi=\r\nvidual or=C2 group,=C2 can stand against the\nwill of a Rishi.&quot;=C2  Arunisha=\r\n asked a pertinent question here. &quot;What\nwere the Rishis doing for=C2 one th=\r\nousand years?&quot;. Manish laughed and\nsaid, &quot; A Rishi can very well spend a th=\r\nousand years simply in samadhi,\nmeditating. Then suddenly=C2 one day=C2 wak=\r\ne up from meditation=C2\nand see that Rishi bhoomi is gone=C2 and all sorts =\r\nof non-spiritual\nthings going on here. So He decides, it is time to get bac=\r\nk and re\ncreate the Rishi bhoomi. You guys have no clue about=C2 what a Ris=\r\nhi\ncan do. One Rishi is enough to change a universe, changing a country is\n=\r\nchild&#39;s play for Him.&quot; Wow. I let all these sink inside me slowly.\nTherefor=\r\ne it is so important to keep doing sadhana, in some manner or\nthe other.\n&gt; =\r\n=C2\n&gt; As night approached midnight, Manish and I left for the Manikarnika\na=\r\ngain. This was going be our last night of Chandi homa at Manikarnika,\nfor n=\r\now. We walked long the=C2 deserted ghats, sliently. I asked him if\nit is ok=\r\n doing a=C2 homa of Shiva/Bhairava on a pyre. He said=C2 yes\nwhy not, but w=\r\nithout Shakti, there will be no Shiva. Worshipping the\ndivine feminie is th=\r\ne most practical strategy of sadhana. Shiva is the\nstate of highest conscio=\r\nusness, and to reach that stage one must develop\nhis body and mind such tha=\r\nt it can hold shakti=C2 for which=C2\nworshipping the divine Mother is the b=\r\nest way.=C2 That is why\nVimalananda says, &quot;Let the Mother show you the face=\r\n of the Father&quot;. The\ntopic drifted to Vimalananda. Manish said, &quot;Kala Bhair=\r\nava is very strong\nin Manikarnika, where as Mahakala exists powerfully in t=\r\nhe cremation\ngrouds at Ujjain. But Vimalananda did Mahakala sadhana here in=\r\n\nManikarnika.&quot; Then staring at the pitch black ganges, Manish chuckled\nligh=\r\ntly and\n&gt; added, &quot;That man was something.&quot; This was again an old conversati=\r\non we\nhad started=C2 before which Mainsh continued, &quot;All these babas of tod=\r\nay\nwould wet their pants if Vimalananda were to stand infornt of them.\nThos=\r\ne three books have the power of a deity flowing through them.\nWithout being=\r\n physically present, Vimalananda has created a army of\nsadhakas!&quot;. I interj=\r\nected, &quot;The books=C2 are like a Bible=C2 for\nsadhakas,=C2 arn&#39;t they?&quot;. &quot;Ye=\r\ns&quot; said Manish. Later on I asked him if\nit was possible for someone to meet=\r\n Vimalanada, to which Manish replied\nthat yes it was, if one does serious s=\r\nadhana. However, the important\nquestion is whether one will be able to reco=\r\ngnize him. I fell silent\nhearing this. Interestingly, in the 2nd book of th=\r\ne Aghora series,\nVimalanda does mention that a time will come when his &quot;chi=\r\nldren&quot; would\nspread homas. Strange, or maybe not so. Who knows how deep thi=\r\nngs run.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; We reached the samshan by half past twelve. This time we s=\r\nat at the\nsame place where we had sat on the first day of homa. The fire wa=\r\ns low.\nMost of the body had been burnt already. Manish started the homa. As=\r\n\nusual, all the dogs came and sat peacefully around the fire. Now this\ndid =\r\nnot surprise me any more. In the middle of the homa Manish would\nslowly lif=\r\nt his=C2 palm upwards=C2 and with the next ahuti=C2\nimmediately the fire wo=\r\nuld leap higher. He did this quite a few times,\nwhen=C2 the flames were get=\r\nting weaker. I countinued with the Chandi\npath and passing on the samagri t=\r\no him as and when he required anything.\nOne dom who was working on a pyre n=\r\nearby, came towards us and\nexclaimed,&quot;Jai Mahadev&quot;. Manish too responded ba=\r\nck, &quot;Jai Mahadev&quot;. This\nhoma was faster. He did not use any &quot;samputs&quot;, but =\r\na direct, straight\nChandi homa. Again in the middle I got up and stroked th=\r\ne pyre a bit,\npushing around some of the coconut pieces to make them burn p=\r\nroperly. I\nwas\n&gt; enjoying it. A few people came and sat near us, listening =\r\nto the path.\nIn Kasi there is a rule that whatever comes in the Samshan is =\r\nthe\nproperty of the Dom Raja (the head of doms). No one has any further\ncla=\r\nim on it. In old times, one Dom Raja was called Kallu Dom. He was an\nAghori=\r\n and a contemporary of Kinnaram Baba. It is said he could raise\nthe dead ba=\r\nck to life. Maybe it is because of this tradition that\nManikarnika is such =\r\nan apt place for these sadhanas. I was at one point\nmentally wondering why =\r\nare there so many people in the samshan. The\nManish said, if a Nath came he=\r\nre in his garb, everyone will run away\nfrom the samshan scared. But there i=\r\ns a reason why there are people here\neven so late in the night.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Onc=\r\ne the final purnahuti was given, we sat for meditation. Though this\nhoma go=\r\nt over faster than previous days, the meditation that happened,\nfor me, was=\r\n superb. At one point I felt as if my mind would just burst\nforth and expan=\r\nd across the length and breadth of the Ganges. My focus\nwas good, but I had=\r\n to open my eyes after every 20 minutes or so. Manish\ncontinued meditating =\r\nfor nearly an hour. Not the slightest movement from\nhim. Nothing. Still lik=\r\ne a stone. Then a cow came and slightly nudged\nManish on his feet. That mad=\r\ne him open his eyes. Manish remarked, &quot; I\ncould have just left my body and =\r\ngone off. It did not matter that I had\na flight to catch the next day, or a=\r\nnything else. I was on the verge of\ndeath. Just at that moment the cow and =\r\nbrought me back.&quot; Smiling he\nadded, &quot;What a sight it would have been for th=\r\ne people to see, how the\nbody can be left at will&quot;.=C2  I did not know what=\r\n to say.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; We stood there watching another pyre in front. The body wa=\r\ns half\nburnt. The torso had become black with deep=C2 red patches all over.=\r\n\nThe dom came forward, and with the bamboo stick inserted it (the bamboo\nst=\r\nick)=C2 from the side of the corpse, lifting up the burning torso\ninto the =\r\nair and placing it again, strategically, in the middle of the\npyre. The smo=\r\noth=C2 motion of lifting up the half burnt torso, sticking\nout from one end=\r\n of the bamboo stick,=C2 into the thin, dark, night-air\nreminded me of how =\r\nwe use a fork to lift pieces of food - meat=C2 or\nvegetables, both dead -=\r\n=C2 from our plates to our mouths. Manish asked\nme smiling, &quot;Maza aya?&quot;. I =\r\nsmiled back in acknowledgement. Then he\ncommented=C2 that I should write ab=\r\nout this experience in the coming\ndays. Let people know.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; By this ti=\r\nme I remembered that when I was sitting and doing the Chandi\npath, one dog=\r\n=C2 had run off with one of my chappals. I informed\nManish. He exclaimed, &quot;=\r\n Kya baat hai! Leave the other chappal here as\nwell.&quot; Manish said we had a =\r\nrna with this samshan. We had been here\nbefore, in some life.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; As we=\r\n were returning, Manish said one of the point (the three\npeaks)=C2 of Shiva=\r\n&#39;s trishul passes through the Manikarkina. Therefore,\nit is a &quot;safe&quot; samsha=\r\nn. Anyone who tries anything negative here will\nface troubles. The trishul =\r\nof Shiva guards this place. No spirit will\ncause any unnecessary disturbanc=\r\ne inside the samshan. That is also why\nthere are people here even at 2 am i=\r\nn the morning. There is safety in\nnumbers. As long as ones intentions are g=\r\nenuine and good, Manikarnika is\na wonderful place to do sadhana.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Wh=\r\nile walking along the ghats=C2 which were=C2 totally deserted,\nManish instr=\r\nucted me not to stop. The knot in my red lungi was becoming\nloose, I caught=\r\n hold of it=C2 with one=C2 hand and kept moving fast,\ntrying to keep pace w=\r\nith Manish. Later Manish asked me if I had got some\nsmell. I thought and re=\r\ncollected that yes, I did get a faint smell of\nheena. Twice. Manish told me=\r\n it was a &quot;Mokul&quot;. A muslim spirit of\nsimilar level as a Yaksha or a Yakshi=\r\nni. Once the ritual is over, and\nyou are out of the samshan, do not wait al=\r\nong the banks, he instructed.\nDo not move too close to the water=C2 late in=\r\n the nightt. There are\nthings in the water. Generally they may not do anyth=\r\ning, but why take a\nchance. The protection of Shiva is only inside the Mani=\r\nkarnika Ghat.\nThen he added, Deoriya Baba (I may have mis-spelt the name) u=\r\nsed to live\nin the middle of this Ganges 24/7. This is a city of saints. He=\r\nre\nGod-intoxicated Paramhamsas would roam around naked. It is their city.\n&gt;=\r\n =C2\n&gt; Next morning, as we sat recollecting the previous night&#39;s homa, Mani=\r\nsh\ntalked about Vedas.=C2 Few sadhaks, if ever, are equally comfortable\nwit=\r\nh both paths of=C2 Aghora and Vedas. For a Veda mantra to show its\neffects,=\r\n one must get the intonation perfect. This age most people\ncannot do that. =\r\nI=C2 enquired that I had heard from someone that a\ncertain procedure needs =\r\nto be done before one starts any sadhana in the\nsamshan. Manish=C2 laughed =\r\nand replied,=C2 &quot;Karna to sab kuch chahiye,\npar mujhe to kuch nehi aata!&quot;.=\r\n=C2 I was dumbstruck.=C2\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; While talking about Ramayana with Arunisha=\r\n, his eyes suddenly become\nhalf closed. He voice became slow and heavy,=C2 =\r\n&quot;The color of Rama&#39;s\nbody is deep blue with a golden tinge all=C2 around hi=\r\nm. Like a sun\nblazing. That=C2 was the kavacha given to Rama by Vishwamitra=\r\n, the real\nGayatri with two special samputs. It was impenetrable. And when =\r\nhe shot\nhis arrows, the motion of his hands=C2 is so fast that a normal hum=\r\nan\neye will not able to observe. In 12 hours he had destroyed a forest of\nA=\r\nshuras.=C2 Ravana had a Chandrahaas khadga. It was a=C2 mantra shakti\nhe ha=\r\nd acquired through sadhana. The Khadga had become part of his right\nhand, w=\r\nhich would fly off to kill mercilessly at the slightest=C2\ncommand from his=\r\n mind. Such was the calibre of the enemy.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; And Rama removed even=C2 =\r\nhis Gayatri Kavacha, and fought like a\nnormal human being when he defeated =\r\nRavana which=C2 means; he even\nremoved the last vestige of his ego of being=\r\n a God, and fought like a\nhuman. Is it any wonder then, that the whole of n=\r\north India goes crazy\nat the mere mention of the name of Sri Rama?&quot;.\n&gt; =C2\n=\r\n&gt; He spoke with such an energy which cannot be defined, as if he was\nthere =\r\nand seen it all. Rama Naam Satya Hai.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Thus ends my recounting of ou=\r\nr fascinating trip to Kasi.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C2 Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rama Na=\r\nama Satya Hai..\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On Sat, 16/1/10, rajarshi nandy rajarshi14@... wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: rajarshi nandy rajarshi14@...\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Rama=\r\n Naam Satya Hai - 2\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Saturday, 16=\r\n January, 2010, 11:25 PM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; =C2\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Narasimha\n&gt; =C2\n&gt;=\r\n It may sound weird, but this is what happens in real life all the\ntime. Yo=\r\nu, I, all these people are pieces in another kind of chess game.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Gr=\r\neat analogy. Manish had given this analogy to us after he=C2\ncompleted a be=\r\nautiful=C2 Ganapati homa last August. There is=C2 one\ndivine chess player, =\r\nand it is totally His game.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Before I continue with the narration, I=\r\n would like to mention a few\npoints which I found I had not clearly mention=\r\ned in my last mail:\n&gt; =C2\n&gt;\n&gt; At the end of the third day of Chandi homa at=\r\n Manikarnika samshan, we\nwere standing and watching the pyres burn, when Ma=\r\nnish suddenly said, in\nthe coming days you will write about this experience=\r\n in a public forum.\nTherefore my mails.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt;\n&gt; Caveat: A homa on a funer=\r\nal pyre is an extreme Aghor=C2 sadhana, and\nit is not entirely risk free. I=\r\nnfact, in many paramparas it is said=C2\nonly someone who has a direct agya =\r\nfrom Samshan Kali or Mahakala can try\nthis procedure, or someone who has ag=\r\nya from a powerful Guru. It was\nManish who was doing the homa, (giving ahut=\r\nis)=C2 I was only doing the\nChandi Path. Therefore, by reading this account=\r\ns one should not, on his\nown, try out this sadhana.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt;\n&gt; Many people h=\r\nave a negative=C2 bias towards Aghor sadhanas and\nAghoris. This is party du=\r\ne to lack of knowledge or understanding of the\nphilosophy and efficacy of t=\r\nhese sadhanas. Moreover, in recent time some\nTV channels too have made film=\r\ns etc of Aghoris, potraying them as\nperverted individuals. This is grossly =\r\nincorrect. They have no clue what\nthey are talking about, and their account=\r\ns start with many preconcieved\nbiases. Aghora is one of the many path to th=\r\ne reach the same goals -\nSelf-realization. It is neither bad nor good. It i=\r\ns a path. Some like\nit, some don&#39;t. Which is ok. We must follow our chosen =\r\npath but at the\nsame time have a healthy respect for other paths too. Many =\r\ngreat saints\nand spiritual giants have taken this path. Guru Dattatreya is =\r\nconsidered\nthe first Aghori. The 9 great Naths were all Aghoris. Sri Trilan=\r\nga Swami\nwas an Aghori too. Vimalanada was a master Aghori. My mails are in=\r\ntended\nto give a first hand objective=C2 account of how a\n&gt; powerful sadhan=\r\na in the samshan is performed. Nothing more. I am just\nthe cronicler.\n&gt; =C2=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; There are many people in this age who have a desire for these\nsadhanas=\r\n, who feel an attraction for this kind of a path, but have no\nclue how to g=\r\no about it. These accounts are ment to tell such=C2 people\nthat these sadha=\r\nnas can and do happen even today, it is not a figment of\nimagination. The M=\r\nanikarnika is still as powerful as it was thousands of\nyears ago. But to go=\r\n about it and=C2 actually be able to do this\nsadhana, just like everything =\r\nelse in life, there is no fixed procedures\nor rules. Keep doing sadhana in =\r\nwhatever condition you are in right\nnow=C2 and let Nature decide. Like Sai =\r\nBaba says, Shradha and Saburi.\nRespect and patience. If the desire is genui=\r\nne and deep, and one is\nready to wait, Nature will one day make arrangement=\r\ns. This is the\neternal promise to every individual=C2 because for Her, NOTH=\r\nING IS\nIMPOSSIBLE. And She is so=C2 kind.=C2  In the intruduction to &quot;Aghor=\r\na\n- At the left hand of God&quot;, Vimalanada says :\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Publish this book af=\r\nter I am gone. Let people know the truth. Let\nthem know what is what. Out o=\r\nf the thousands who may read it at least a\nfew will be sincere. They will t=\r\nry to learn more, and then Nature\nHerself will make arrangements for them t=\r\no learn just as She did for me,\nand they will be taught according to their =\r\ncapabilities. The progression\nwill go on; there is nothing to fear&quot;.\n&gt; Ther=\r\nefore have faith, do sadhana.=C2\n&gt;\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Back to the narration. The secon=\r\nd day was Astami Tithi of Krishna\nPaksha. Manish said it is a powerful nigh=\r\nt for chita homa. Various\nshaktis are available on this night which can des=\r\ntroy Ashuras.=C2 Past\nmidnight we were walking towards Manikarnika along th=\r\ne ghats. Not a\nsingle person was to be seen anywhere on any of the multitud=\r\ne of ghats\nwhich we crossed. Suddenly we found a pack of dogs, fighting amo=\r\nng each\nother, blocking our path. We stopped, wondering if there was any\nal=\r\nternate route to the samshan. I started mentally chanting a mantra I\nknew a=\r\nnd praying to the deity to make our journey smooth.\nCoincidentally, just at=\r\n that moment we saw a man coming from the other\nside who chased the dogs aw=\r\nay.=C2 Without looking at me=C2 Manish\nsaid, &quot;Sometimes a simple prayer can=\r\n work wonders but never become to\nbig for your breeches&quot;.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; As we pas=\r\nsed the Lalita Ghat Manish said this is a wonderful\nplace.=C2 I did not thi=\r\nnk too much about it then since my mind was\nalready pre occupied with the t=\r\nhoughts of what is to come. The next day\nmorning when we again came to the =\r\nLalita Ghat for some shooting, I\nsuddenly felt a pressure on my head, and t=\r\nhen everything became calm.\nManish smiled at me and said this is where Tril=\r\nanga Swami did his\ntapashya and the energies are still here. I was little s=\r\nkeptical\nmentally, since I knew that the samadhi of Trilanga Swami was at a=\r\n\ndifferent ghat, however I did not say anything.=C2 Later on returning\nto M=\r\numbai I spoke to someone who was from Beneras and that person\nconfirmed tha=\r\nt indeed Trilanga Swami used to stay at the Lalita Ghat and\ndo his sadhana.=\r\n Conclusion, I am a confirmed idiot.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Back to midnight. We reached M=\r\nanikarnika and again it was filled with\npeople. But this time we did not wa=\r\nit. We went right inside, and Manish\nkept looking for a suitable chita. As =\r\nwe came in, again people started\nstaring at us, but they respectfully made =\r\nway for us to pass through to\nthe middle of the samshan. We stood exactly a=\r\nt the middle, with Manish\nobserving the different chitas. There were about =\r\n8/10 of them burning.\nIt is said in thousands of years there has not been a=\r\n single minute when\nthere has not been a body burning in here. Therefore it=\r\n is one of the\nMahasamshans in India. There was one chita to my right which=\r\n Manish was\nobserving, when suddenly I found a mega size bull come and stan=\r\nd right\nnext to the fire. I did not want to sit there, the bull looked\ndang=\r\nerous. Before I could voice my concern, Manish said let us go to the\nother =\r\nside of the samshan. It not only the bull,=C2  but there is\nsomething else =\r\nas well. I did not ask him what. So we\n&gt; went to another side. The dom ther=\r\ne came forward and said to Manish,\n&quot;Baba,aap log=C2 kaun se chita me baithn=\r\na chahate ho?&quot;. Manish\nindicated one at the end, the dome then went ahead a=\r\nnd asked the people\nstanding around the chita to make space for us to sit. =\r\nHe said the heat\nfrom the fire is too stong, but Manish said it&#39;s ok, we&#39;ll=\r\n sit here\nitself. There were many curious onlookers, but all made space for=\r\n us to\nsit comfortably. I could hear the dom instructing others not to dist=\r\nurb\nthe pyre we were sitting at. This is something very unique about\nManika=\r\nrnika. IN any other city, people would have objected, but not\nhere. Manish =\r\nlater said, it is a tradition of this place, Aghor sadhanas\nhave been done =\r\nin here for countless centuries. Therefore the domes have\neither themsleves=\r\n seen these things or heard from their families and\nthus they do not distur=\r\nb.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; The homa, as usual was awesome. The pyre was larger than the one=\r\n\nprevious night. The heat was very strong. My focus was stronger. My mind\nw=\r\nas much calmer than the previous night. Within ten minutes again a pack\nof =\r\ndogs came and sat around this pyre. This was strange because=C2\nthere were =\r\nat least ten pyres burning, and all of them chose this\nspecific pyre for so=\r\nme inexplicable reason. Dogs have a far subtler\nsense perception than avera=\r\nge humans like me. This homa was extended\nlonger. Every now and then Manish=\r\n would suddenly look at a certain\ndirection intently for a few second. I to=\r\no would turn and look that way\nbut saw nothing. But, everytime Manish looke=\r\nd at a specific direction or\nmade some gestures, the dogs too would start b=\r\narking at that direction.\nAt one point I almost felt a bit jealous of the d=\r\nogs, they could\nsee/sense things which I=C2  - being such an=C2 ordinary pe=\r\nrson -=C2\nobviously had no clue about. In the middle of the Chandi path=C2 =\r\nI\ncould hear\n&gt; chants of &quot;Ram Nam Satya Hai&quot; and relatives wailing as new b=\r\nodies were\nbeing brought in.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Suddenly to my right there was a sound=\r\n and quite abit of smoke, I saw\na transformer bursting. The dogs immediatel=\r\ny started barking at that.\nLater Manish said the Goddess was moving around,=\r\n entering the fire and\nleaving the fire. The bursting of the transformer ha=\r\nd a link to this. As\nthe Path was going on - the Chandi was in my right han=\r\nd - I saw a human\nshadow pass over=C2 the pages of the=C2 book. I thought i=\r\nt was some\nrelative who was standing behind me.=C2 I looked back and was a =\r\nshocked\nto find there was no one behind me. And the shadow passed over my b=\r\nook\nonce again. This time I did not look back. Just kept chanting with more=\r\n\nvigor and saying to myself &quot;all iz well&quot;-:).=C2  Manish later said, as\none=\r\n does sadhana the deity often comes to observe and make his/her\npresence fe=\r\nlt, even if slightly.=C2 It is not an imagination but\nreality and this can=\r\n=C2 happen not just in a samshan but in any sadhana\nanywhere. The idea is t=\r\no keep doing sadhana.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; While offering coconuts into the fire, one co=\r\nconut rolled off from the\npyre. So I took a long bamboo stick which the dom=\r\nes use to stroke the\nfire and pushed the coconut piece inside.I wondered if=\r\n I=C2 had been a\ndom in any of my past lives, because I strangely felt natu=\r\nral stroking\nthe pyre=C2 the way the domes do. I even wondered if=C2 there =\r\nwas any\ncompany which would may me for this kind of a job, I would happily =\r\ntake\nit. What better way to do sadhana than become a dom at Manikarkina!=C2=\r\n\nInterestingly, I then remembered that Manish had bought one extra\ncoconut =\r\nwhile buying the samagri to tonight&#39;s homas. Now I understood\nwhy.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; =\r\nIn the middle of the homa, suddenly Manish called one of the relatives\nwho =\r\nwas standing nearby and told him=C2 that the person whos body was\nin the py=\r\nre has just left and that=C2 they (relatives) do not have to\nwait any more.=\r\n It was already late in the night. The person did not know\nwhat to say. Sud=\r\ndenly Manish explained to him, do not worry, there is\nnothing evil or bad b=\r\neing done here. We are only praying to Ma Durga. I\nguess the person was men=\r\ntally wondering about what is going on. Then\nanother of the relatives came =\r\nforward and said, &quot;Baba, hum log ahsirwad\nleke hi jayenge&quot;. So Manish said =\r\nok and asked them to sit down and\ncontinued with the homa. In the middle of=\r\n the homa suddenly Manish asked\nme to observe the skin on the corpse=C2  I =\r\nsaw the skin on the face had\ncaught fire and was burning. It was a sight to=\r\n see!\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; There is a tradition of pouring Ganges water=C2 at the end to=\r\n finsh\nthe fire. But I could hear the domes telling the relatives not to po=\r\nur\nwater on the pyre or do anything there without permissin from Manish.\nFi=\r\nnally at the end they came to Manish and=C2 asked if they could pour\nsome G=\r\nanges water. Manish said ok, but in a low voice told me nothing\nwill happen=\r\n to the fire, it won&#39;t die. They poured a large mud kalash\nfull of water bu=\r\nt nothing happened to the fire. It kept burning. After\nsome times, after so=\r\nme more ahutis, Manish called the people and said, &quot;\nDevi=C2 samne khadi ha=\r\ni. App log pranam kijiye&quot;. At least 10/15 people\ncame forward and revential=\r\nly bowed to the fire. Then they wanted to\ntouch=C2 Manish&#39;s feet, but Manis=\r\nh would not let them do so. They asked\nfor his blessings. He distributed so=\r\nme flower petals we had and told\nthem to go home, since it was very late in=\r\n the night. Suddenly the man,\nwho had some doubts (whom Manish had addresse=\r\nd earlier) came\n&gt; running with tears in his eyes asking for forgiveness for=\r\n having\ndoubted. Manish consoled him, told him nothing to worry, he has don=\r\ne no\nwrong, everything is all right.=C2  Later Manish said, if it was some\n=\r\nother time of the day he would have brought the man along for a cup of\ntea.=\r\n Another person suddenly came to Manish and asked him if he was a\ncertain s=\r\naint (a famous saint)=C2 who used to live in Kasi. Manish\nwithout respondin=\r\ng to his query asked him where was he from, the person\nreplied interior=C2 =\r\nBihar. Manish advised him to go back home as it was\nlate in the night. The =\r\nfaith of the ordinary people of this land is what\nmakes India so unique, th=\r\nat is why our land and culture is still so\nalive. We city bred &#39;educated&#39;=\r\n=C2 people are too rational to understand\nthese things. God loves the simpl=\r\ne and uncalculating. By this time I too\nstood up to do pranam to the fire. =\r\nImmediately I felt as if my body\nexisted only from my head to my heart, the=\r\nre was nothing\n&gt; below, no legs, no stomach ,=C2 as if=C2 I was simply floa=\r\nting on\nthin=C2 air! I told Manish what happened, he just gave a=C2 curt on=\r\ne\nword reply, &quot;Good&quot;.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; As we were walking back from Mani=\r\nkarnika Manish suddenly said, &quot;There\nis a foreigner lady who lives close to=\r\n Manikarnika, who has a lot of\ndesire to perform sadhanas in the samshan bu=\r\nt does not know how to go\nabout it. I saw her while meditating.&quot; For a woma=\r\nn to come and perform\nthese sadhanas is practically difficult or impossible=\r\n, unless she is a\nYogini or a sadhaka of great calibre. Ordinary people wou=\r\nld not be able\nto meet the gaze of a Yogini, said Manish. The next morning,=\r\n when we\ncame to the Lalita Ghat (as I mentioned above), I saw a thin, frai=\r\nl,\nlooking foreigner lady sitting on the banks. Manish quitely indicated to=\r\n\nme that, that is the lady whom he had seen last night in his meditation\nat=\r\n the samshan. &quot;She has desire, but directionless. &quot; At that time there\nwas =\r\nnothing more we could do. I guess that is why it is so important to\nkeep do=\r\ning some sadhana on your own, instead of merely contemplating\nwhich is of n=\r\no good,=C2 so that you are ready when\n&gt; Nature decides to give you a push.\n=\r\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; After passing the Lalita Ghat, next afternoon,=C2 we stood and\nobse=\r\nrved Manikarnika from a distance. We were dressed like any other\ntourist, s=\r\npecially with Manish&#39;s camera hanging from his neck=C2 and\nthe=C2 tripod. M=\r\nanish smiled and said let us not go too close to\nManikarnika, what if the d=\r\noms recognize us! They would be shell shocked\nseeing us dressed as tourists=\r\n, wondering what is going on.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Thus ended my second day of observing=\r\n a Chandi homa on a funeral pyre\nat the famed Manikarnika Ghats of Kashi.\n&gt;=\r\n =C2\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; =C2\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rama Naam Satya Hai\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The IN=\r\nTERNET now has a personality.

I was w=\r\nriting in a flow and never checked what I wrote. Kindly pardon such errors =\r\nand read through them. As they say, &quot;Bhavnayoko samjho!&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; During the day time, we roamed=\r\n around shooting at different places. In this 3 days we never visited any o=\r\nf the temples in Kasi. I asked him, &quot;What about the temples? Won&#39;t we visit=\r\n them?&quot;. Manish retorted immediately, &quot;=C2&nbsp;Aren&#39;t we=C2&nbsp;going to =\r\nthe most powerful temple in Kasi every night?&quot;! I silently agreed. This is =\r\nsomething about Manish I have observed. He rarely enters temples or standar=\r\nd places of worship, but suddenly he might see a small roadside temple and =\r\nstand and stare for sometimes, even do a pranam and then remark, &quot;There is =\r\nsomething here.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; During evening we went to visit =\r\nthe Kinnaram Ashram. Kinnaram Baba was a Aghori who lived in Kasi=C2&nbsp;d=\r\nuring the 16th century. The place is called Aghor-sthal. Before entering Ma=\r\nnish bought some bel leaves. As we walked inside the Ashram, Manish became =\r\nsilent, then said there are strong energies in here. Inside we meditated fo=\r\nr sometime, Manish did=C2&nbsp; pranam=C2&nbsp;at the samadhi of Baba Bhagw=\r\nan Ram who was the 11th head of the Ashram. Baba Bhagwan Ram had entered Ni=\r\nrvikalpa Samadhi while meditating for 3 continuous days at the Manikarnika =\r\nSamshan.=C2&nbsp; Manish, on being=C2&nbsp;questioned, said that many sadha=\r\nnas have been done here in this place for long by people with no mundane de=\r\nsires. Therefore, the energies are strong here. While looking around the As=\r\nhram we found some quotations which were written in small wooden boards. Ma=\r\nnish called Arunisha and me and pointed to one quotation. Translated to Eng=\r\nlish, it read, &quot;If you have to give your head off to get a sadguru, you&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; have=C2&nbsp;got it cheap&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; By 8 PM we sat f=\r\nor dinner. We used to have early dinners, so that we had sufficient time be=\r\nfore going to the samshan. Ideally you should have an empty stomach while p=\r\nerforming any sadhana to get the best effects. The amount of fire in the bo=\r\ndy is fixed. There is one that digests food - Jathara Agni. One that digest=\r\ns ideas/concepts/experiences - Bhuta Agni (existential fire) which exists i=\r\nn the subtle body. It is the second which must increase in order for one to=\r\n &quot;digest&quot; various experiences/ideas/etc. It can only increase when the Jath=\r\nara Agni is less, i.e. you do not have a full stomach. When we are extremel=\r\ny focused on something and working intently on the same, we forget food, we=\r\n do not feel hungry. This is due to the increase in Bhuta Agni and decrease=\r\n in Jathara Agni.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; As we sat eating our food and t=\r\nalking on different topics, we discussed history.The conversation mentioned=\r\n here is a thread picked up from an earlier conversation that we (Manish, A=\r\nrunisha and=C2&nbsp;me) had before coming to Kasi. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Manish said, &quot;It is the same set of=C2&nbsp;souls who come back=C2&nbsp;=\r\nagain and again in different bodies and personalities at different times, w=\r\nho=C2&nbsp;are responsible for this land. There was Chadragupta and Chanaky=\r\na, there was Prithviraj, there was Akbar, Shankaracharya, Ramakrishna etc.&quot;=\r\n He continued, &quot;They can come as kings, yogis, or any other form which is n=\r\necessary for them to accomplish their dharma. And their dharma is connected=\r\n to this land=C2&nbsp;which we call India=C2&nbsp;today.This land is connec=\r\nted to the Rishis. This is Rishi bhoomi. And Rishis sent people when needed=\r\n.=C2&nbsp;Prithviraj made one mistake, of pardoning Ghori. Imagine what hap=\r\npened to that woman who made Prithiviraj disobey his Guru?&quot;.I silently cont=\r\nemplated her fate.=C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;One very senior Rish=\r\ni has decided to=C2&nbsp;change this land back to a Rishi bhoomi. And so sh=\r\nall it happen.=C2&nbsp;Ved=C2&nbsp;Dharma will be re established here along=\r\n the length and breadth. Nothing, however powerful or mightly, be it an ind=\r\nividual or=C2&nbsp;group,=C2&nbsp;can stand against the will of a Rishi.&quot;=\r\n=C2&nbsp; Arunisha asked a pertinent question here. &quot;What were the Rishis d=\r\noing for=C2&nbsp;one thousand years?&quot;. Manish laughed and said, &quot; A Rishi c=\r\nan very well spend a thousand years simply in samadhi, meditating. Then sud=\r\ndenly=C2&nbsp;one day=C2&nbsp;wake up from meditation=C2&nbsp;and see that =\r\nRishi bhoomi is gone=C2&nbsp;and all sorts of non-spiritual things going on=\r\n here. So He decides, it is time to get back and re create the Rishi bhoomi=\r\n. You guys have no clue about=C2&nbsp;what a Rishi can do. One Rishi is eno=\r\nugh to change a universe, changing a country is child&#39;s play for Him.&quot; Wow.=\r\n I let all these sink inside me slowly. Therefore it is so important to kee=\r\np doing sadhana, in some manner or the other.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; As =\r\nnight approached midnight, Manish and I left for the Manikarnika again. Thi=\r\ns was going be our last night of Chandi homa at Manikarnika, for now. We wa=\r\nlked long the=C2&nbsp;deserted ghats, sliently. I asked him if it is ok doi=\r\nng a=C2&nbsp;homa of Shiva/Bhairava on a pyre. He said=C2&nbsp;yes why not,=\r\n but without Shakti, there will be no Shiva. Worshipping the divine feminie=\r\n is the most practical strategy of sadhana. Shiva is the state of highest c=\r\nonsciousness, and to reach that stage one must develop his body and mind su=\r\nch that it can hold shakti=C2&nbsp;for which=C2&nbsp;worshipping the divine=\r\n Mother is the best way.=C2&nbsp;That is why Vimalananda says, &quot;Let the Mot=\r\nher show you the face of the Father&quot;. The topic drifted to Vimalananda. Man=\r\nish said, &quot;Kala Bhairava is very strong in Manikarnika, where as Mahakala e=\r\nxists powerfully in the cremation grouds at Ujjain. But Vimalananda did Mah=\r\nakala sadhana here in Manikarnika.&quot; Then staring at the pitch black ganges,=\r\n Manish chuckled lightly and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; added, &quot;That man was something.&quot; This =\r\nwas again an old conversation we had started=C2&nbsp;before which Mainsh co=\r\nntinued, &quot;All these babas of today would wet their pants if Vimalananda wer=\r\ne to stand infornt of them. Those three books have the power of a deity flo=\r\nwing through them. Without being physically present, Vimalananda has create=\r\nd a army of sadhakas!&quot;. I interjected, &quot;The books=C2&nbsp;are like a Bible=\r\n=C2&nbsp;for sadhakas,=C2&nbsp;arn&#39;t they?&quot;. &quot;Yes&quot; said Manish. Later on I =\r\nasked him if it was possible for someone to meet Vimalanada, to which Manis=\r\nh replied that yes it was, if one does serious sadhana. However, the import=\r\nant question is whether one will be able to recognize him. I fell silent he=\r\naring this. Interestingly, in the 2nd book of the Aghora series, Vimalanda =\r\ndoes mention that a time will come when his &quot;children&quot; would spread homas. =\r\nStrange, or maybe not so. Who knows how deep things run. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; We reached the samshan by half past twelve. This time we sat at th=\r\ne same place where we had sat on the first day of homa. The fire was low. M=\r\nost of the body had been burnt already. Manish started the homa. As usual, =\r\nall the dogs came and sat peacefully around the fire. Now this did not surp=\r\nrise me any more. In the middle of the homa Manish would slowly lift his=C2=\r\n&nbsp;palm upwards=C2&nbsp;and with the next ahuti=C2&nbsp;immediately the =\r\nfire would leap higher. He did this quite a few times, when=C2&nbsp;the fla=\r\nmes were getting weaker. I countinued with the Chandi path and passing on t=\r\nhe samagri to him as and when he required anything. One dom who was working=\r\n on a pyre nearby, came towards us and exclaimed,&quot;Jai Mahadev&quot;. Manish too =\r\nresponded back, &quot;Jai Mahadev&quot;. This homa was faster. He did not use any &quot;sa=\r\nmputs&quot;, but a direct, straight Chandi homa. Again in the middle I got up an=\r\nd stroked the pyre a bit, pushing around some of the coconut pieces to make=\r\n them burn properly. I was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; enjoying it. A few people came and sat n=\r\near us, listening to the path. In Kasi there is a rule that whatever comes =\r\nin the Samshan is the property of the Dom Raja (the head of doms). No one h=\r\nas any further claim on it. In old times, one Dom Raja was called Kallu Dom=\r\n. He was an Aghori and a contemporary of Kinnaram Baba. It is said he could=\r\n raise the dead back to life. Maybe it is because of this tradition that Ma=\r\nnikarnika is such an apt place for these sadhanas. I was at one point menta=\r\nlly wondering why are there so many people in the samshan. The Manish said,=\r\n if a Nath came here in his garb, everyone will run away from the samshan s=\r\ncared. But there is a reason why there are people here even so late in the =\r\nnight.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Once the final purnahuti was given, we sat=\r\n for meditation. Though this homa got over faster than previous days, the m=\r\neditation that happened, for me, was superb. At one point I felt as if my m=\r\nind would just burst forth and expand across the length and breadth of the =\r\nGanges. My focus was good, but I had to open my eyes after every 20 minutes=\r\n or so. Manish continued meditating for nearly an hour. Not the slightest m=\r\novement from him. Nothing. Still like a stone. Then a cow came and slightly=\r\n nudged Manish on his feet. That made him open his eyes. Manish remarked, &quot;=\r\n I could have just left my body and gone off. It did not matter that I had =\r\na flight to catch the next day, or anything else. I was on the verge of dea=\r\nth. Just at that moment the cow and brought me back.&quot; Smiling he added, &quot;Wh=\r\nat a sight it would have been for the people to see, how the body can be le=\r\nft at will&quot;.=C2&nbsp; I did not know what to say. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; We stood there watching another pyre in front. The body was half burnt. T=\r\nhe torso had become black with deep=C2&nbsp;red patches all over. The dom c=\r\name forward, and with the bamboo stick inserted it (the bamboo stick)=C2&nb=\r\nsp;from the side of the corpse, lifting up the burning torso into the air a=\r\nnd placing it again, strategically, in the middle of the pyre. The smooth=\r\n=C2&nbsp;motion of lifting up the half burnt torso, sticking out from one e=\r\nnd of the bamboo stick,=C2&nbsp;into the thin, dark, night-air reminded me =\r\nof how we use a fork to lift pieces of food - meat=C2&nbsp;or vegetables, b=\r\noth dead -=C2&nbsp;from our plates to our mouths. Manish asked me smiling, =\r\n&quot;Maza aya?&quot;. I smiled back in acknowledgement. Then he commented=C2&nbsp;th=\r\nat I should write about this experience in the coming days. Let people know=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; By this time I remembered that when I was sitti=\r\nng and doing the Chandi path, one dog=C2&nbsp;had run off with one of my ch=\r\nappals. I informed Manish. He exclaimed, &quot; Kya baat hai! Leave the other ch=\r\nappal here as well.&quot; Manish said we had a rna with this samshan. We had bee=\r\nn here before, in some life.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; As we were returning=\r\n, Manish said one of the point (the three peaks)=C2&nbsp;of Shiva&#39;s trishul=\r\n passes through the Manikarkina. Therefore, it is a &quot;safe&quot; samshan. Anyone =\r\nwho tries anything negative here will face troubles. The trishul of Shiva g=\r\nuards this place. No spirit will cause any unnecessary disturbance inside t=\r\nhe samshan. That is also why there are people here even at 2 am in the morn=\r\ning. There is safety in numbers. As long as ones intentions are genuine and=\r\n good, Manikarnika is a wonderful place to do sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; While walking along the ghats=C2&nbsp;which were=C2&nbsp;totally dese=\r\nrted, Manish instructed me not to stop. The knot in my red lungi was becomi=\r\nng loose, I caught hold of it=C2&nbsp;with one=C2&nbsp;hand and kept moving=\r\n fast, trying to keep pace with Manish. Later Manish asked me if I had got =\r\nsome smell. I thought and recollected that yes, I did get a faint smell of =\r\nheena. Twice. Manish told me it was a &quot;Mokul&quot;. A muslim spirit of similar l=\r\nevel as a Yaksha or a Yakshini. Once the ritual is over, and you are out of=\r\n the samshan, do not wait along the banks, he instructed. Do not move too c=\r\nlose to the water=C2&nbsp;late in the nightt. There are things in the water=\r\n. Generally they may not do anything, but why take a chance. The protection=\r\n of Shiva is only inside the Manikarnika Ghat. Then he added, Deoriya Baba =\r\n(I may have mis-spelt the name) used to live in the middle of this Ganges 2=\r\n4/7. This is a city of saints. Here God-intoxicated Paramhamsas would roam =\r\naround naked. It is their city.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Next morning, as =\r\nwe sat recollecting the previous night&#39;s homa, Manish talked about Vedas.=\r\n=C2&nbsp;Few sadhaks, if ever, are equally comfortable with both paths of=\r\n=C2&nbsp;Aghora and Vedas. For a Veda mantra to show its effects, one must =\r\nget the intonation perfect. This age most people cannot do that. I=C2&nbsp;=\r\nenquired that I had heard from someone that a certain procedure needs to be=\r\n done before one starts any sadhana in the samshan. Manish=C2&nbsp;laughed =\r\nand replied,=C2&nbsp;&quot;Karna to sab kuch chahiye, par mujhe to kuch nehi aat=\r\na!&quot;.=C2&nbsp;I was dumbstruck.=C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; While tal=\r\nking about Ramayana with Arunisha, his eyes suddenly become half closed. He=\r\n voice became slow and heavy,=C2&nbsp;&quot;The color of Rama&#39;s body is deep blu=\r\ne with a golden tinge all=C2&nbsp;around him. Like a sun blazing. That=C2&n=\r\nbsp;was the kavacha given to Rama by Vishwamitra, the real Gayatri with two=\r\n special samputs. It was impenetrable. And when he shot his arrows, the mot=\r\nion of his hands=C2&nbsp;is so fast that a normal human eye will not able t=\r\no observe. In 12 hours he had destroyed a forest of Ashuras.=C2&nbsp;Ravana=\r\n had a Chandrahaas khadga. It was a=C2&nbsp;mantra shakti he had acquired t=\r\nhrough sadhana. The Khadga had become part of his right hand, which would f=\r\nly off to kill mercilessly at the slightest=C2&nbsp;command from his mind. =\r\nSuch was the calibre of the enemy. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; And Rama remo=\r\nved even=C2&nbsp;his Gayatri Kavacha, and fought like a normal human being =\r\nwhen he defeated Ravana which=C2&nbsp;means; he even removed the last vesti=\r\nge of his ego of being a God, and fought like a human. Is it any wonder the=\r\nn, that the whole of north India goes crazy at the mere mention of the name=\r\n of Sri Rama?&quot;. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; He spoke with such an energy whi=\r\nch cannot be defined, as if he was there and seen it all. Rama Naam Satya H=\r\nai.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thus ends my recounting of our fascinating tr=\r\nip to Kasi.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rama Naama Satya Hai..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --=\r\n- On Sat, 16/1/10, rajarshi nandy rajarshi14@... wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; From: rajarshi nandy rajarshi14@...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] =\r\nRama Naam Satya Hai - 2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Da=\r\nte: Saturday, 16 January, 2010, 11:25 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; Dear Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; It may sound weird, but th=\r\nis is what happens in real life all the time. You, I, all these people are =\r\npieces in another kind of chess game. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Great anal=\r\nogy. Manish had given this analogy to us after he=C2&nbsp;completed a beaut=\r\niful=C2&nbsp;Ganapati homa last August. There is=C2&nbsp;one divine chess p=\r\nlayer, and it is totally His game. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Before I cont=\r\ninue with the narration, I would like to mention a few points which I found=\r\n I had not clearly mentioned in my last mail:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; At the end of the third day of Chandi homa at Manikarnika samshan, we=\r\n were standing and watching the pyres burn, when Manish suddenly said, in t=\r\nhe coming days you will write about this experience in a public forum. Ther=\r\nefore my mails.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Caveat: A homa on a fune=\r\nral pyre is an extreme Aghor=C2&nbsp;sadhana, and it is not entirely risk f=\r\nree. Infact, in many paramparas it is said=C2&nbsp;only someone who has a d=\r\nirect agya from Samshan Kali or Mahakala can try this procedure, or someone=\r\n who has agya from a powerful Guru. It was Manish who was doing the homa, (=\r\ngiving ahutis)=C2&nbsp;I was only doing the Chandi Path. Therefore, by read=\r\ning this accounts one should not, on his own, try out this sadhana. &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Many people have a negative=C2&nbsp;bias towar=\r\nds Aghor sadhanas and Aghoris. This is party due to lack of knowledge or un=\r\nderstanding of the philosophy and efficacy of these sadhanas. Moreover, in =\r\nrecent time some TV channels too have made films etc of Aghoris, potraying =\r\nthem as perverted individuals. This is grossly incorrect. They have no clue=\r\n what they are talking about, and their accounts start with many preconciev=\r\ned biases. Aghora is one of the many path to the reach the same goals - Sel=\r\nf-realization. It is neither bad nor good. It is a path. Some like it, some=\r\n don&#39;t. Which is ok. We must follow our chosen path but at the same time ha=\r\nve a healthy respect for other paths too. Many great saints and spiritual g=\r\niants have taken this path. Guru Dattatreya is considered the first Aghori.=\r\n The 9 great Naths were all Aghoris. Sri Trilanga Swami was an Aghori too. =\r\nVimalanada was a master Aghori. My mails are intended to give a first hand =\r\nobjective=C2&nbsp;account of how a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; powerful sadhana in the samshan =\r\nis performed. Nothing more. I am just the cronicler.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; There are many people in this age who have a desire for these =\r\nsadhanas, who feel an attraction for this kind of a path, but have no clue =\r\nhow to go about it. These accounts are ment to tell such=C2&nbsp;people tha=\r\nt these sadhanas can and do happen even today, it is not a figment of imagi=\r\nnation. The Manikarnika is still as powerful as it was thousands of years a=\r\ngo. But to go about it and=C2&nbsp;actually be able to do this sadhana, jus=\r\nt like everything else in life, there is no fixed procedures or rules. Keep=\r\n doing sadhana in whatever condition you are in right now=C2&nbsp;and let N=\r\nature decide. Like Sai Baba says, Shradha and Saburi. Respect and patience.=\r\n If the desire is genuine and deep, and one is ready to wait, Nature will o=\r\nne day make arrangements. This is the eternal promise to every individual=\r\n=C2&nbsp;because for Her, NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE. And She is so=C2&nbsp;kind=\r\n.=C2&nbsp; In the intruduction to &quot;Aghora - At the left hand of God&quot;, Vimal=\r\nanada says :&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Publish this book after I am gone. =\r\nLet people know the truth. Let them know what is what. Out of the thousands=\r\n who may read it at least a few will be sincere. They will try to learn mor=\r\ne, and then Nature Herself will make arrangements for them to learn just as=\r\n She did for me, and they will be taught according to their capabilities. T=\r\nhe progression will go on; there is nothing to fear&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Therefore hav=\r\ne faith, do sadhana.=C2&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Back to t=\r\nhe narration. The second day was Astami Tithi of Krishna Paksha. Manish sai=\r\nd it is a powerful night for chita homa. Various shaktis are available on t=\r\nhis night which can destroy Ashuras.=C2&nbsp;Past midnight we were walking =\r\ntowards Manikarnika along the ghats. Not a single person was to be seen any=\r\nwhere on any of the multitude of ghats which we crossed. Suddenly we found =\r\na pack of dogs, fighting among each other, blocking our path. We stopped, w=\r\nondering if there was any alternate route to the samshan. I started mentall=\r\ny chanting a mantra I knew and praying to the deity to make our journey smo=\r\noth. Coincidentally, just at that moment we saw a man coming from the other=\r\n side who chased the dogs away.=C2&nbsp;Without looking at me=C2&nbsp;Manis=\r\nh said, &quot;Sometimes a simple prayer can work wonders but never become to big=\r\n for your breeches&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; As we passed the Lalita Ghat=\r\n Manish said this is a wonderful place.=C2&nbsp;I did not think too much ab=\r\nout it then since my mind was already pre occupied with the thoughts of wha=\r\nt is to come. The next day morning when we again came to the Lalita Ghat fo=\r\nr some shooting, I suddenly felt a pressure on my head, and then everything=\r\n became calm. Manish smiled at me and said this is where Trilanga Swami did=\r\n his tapashya and the energies are still here. I was little skeptical menta=\r\nlly, since I knew that the samadhi of Trilanga Swami was at a different gha=\r\nt, however I did not say anything.=C2&nbsp;Later on returning to Mumbai I s=\r\npoke to someone who was from Beneras and that person confirmed that indeed =\r\nTrilanga Swami used to stay at the Lalita Ghat and do his sadhana. Conclusi=\r\non, I am a confirmed idiot.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Back to midnight. We =\r\nreached Manikarnika and again it was filled with people. But this time we d=\r\nid not wait. We went right inside, and Manish kept looking for a suitable c=\r\nhita. As we came in, again people started staring at us, but they respectfu=\r\nlly made way for us to pass through to the middle of the samshan. We stood =\r\nexactly at the middle, with Manish observing the different chitas. There we=\r\nre about 8/10 of them burning. It is said in thousands of years there has n=\r\not been a single minute when there has not been a body burning in here. The=\r\nrefore it is one of the Mahasamshans in India. There was one chita to my ri=\r\nght which Manish was observing, when suddenly I found a mega size bull come=\r\n and stand right next to the fire. I did not want to sit there, the bull lo=\r\noked dangerous. Before I could voice my concern, Manish said let us go to t=\r\nhe other side of the samshan. It not only the bull,=C2&nbsp; but there is s=\r\nomething else as well. I did not ask him what. So we&lt;BR&gt;&gt; went to anothe=\r\nr side. The dom there came forward and said to Manish, &quot;Baba,aap log=C2&nbs=\r\np;kaun se chita me baithna chahate ho?&quot;. Manish indicated one at the end, t=\r\nhe dome then went ahead and asked the people standing around the chita to m=\r\nake space for us to sit. He said the heat from the fire is too stong, but M=\r\nanish said it&#39;s ok, we&#39;ll sit here itself. There were many curious onlooker=\r\ns, but all made space for us to sit comfortably. I could hear the dom instr=\r\nucting others not to disturb the pyre we were sitting at. This is something=\r\n very unique about Manikarnika. IN any other city, people would have object=\r\ned, but not here. Manish later said, it is a tradition of this place, Aghor=\r\n sadhanas have been done in here for countless centuries. Therefore the dom=\r\nes have either themsleves seen these things or heard from their families an=\r\nd thus they do not disturb. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The homa, as usual w=\r\nas awesome. The pyre was larger than the one previous night. The heat was v=\r\nery strong. My focus was stronger. My mind was much calmer than the previou=\r\ns night. Within ten minutes again a pack of dogs came and sat around this p=\r\nyre. This was strange because=C2&nbsp;there were at least ten pyres burning=\r\n, and all of them chose this specific pyre for some inexplicable reason. Do=\r\ngs have a far subtler sense perception than average humans like me. This ho=\r\nma was extended longer. Every now and then Manish would suddenly look at a =\r\ncertain direction intently for a few second. I too would turn and look that=\r\n way but saw nothing. But, everytime Manish looked at a specific direction =\r\nor made some gestures, the dogs too would start barking at that direction. =\r\nAt one point I almost felt a bit jealous of the dogs, they could see/sense =\r\nthings which I=C2&nbsp; - being such an=C2&nbsp;ordinary person -=C2&nbsp;o=\r\nbviously had no clue about. In the middle of the Chandi path=C2&nbsp;I coul=\r\nd hear&lt;BR&gt;&gt; chants of &quot;Ram Nam Satya Hai&quot; and relatives wailing as new b=\r\nodies were being brought in. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Suddenly to my righ=\r\nt there was a sound and quite abit of smoke, I saw a transformer bursting. =\r\nThe dogs immediately started barking at that. Later Manish said the Goddess=\r\n was moving around, entering the fire and leaving the fire. The bursting of=\r\n the transformer had a link to this. As the Path was going on - the Chandi =\r\nwas in my right hand - I saw a human shadow pass over=C2&nbsp;the pages of =\r\nthe=C2&nbsp;book. I thought it was some relative who was standing behind me=\r\n.=C2&nbsp;I looked back and was a shocked to find there was no one behind m=\r\ne. And the shadow passed over my book once again. This time I did not look =\r\nback. Just kept chanting with more vigor and saying to myself &quot;all iz well&quot;=\r\n-:).=C2&nbsp; Manish later said, as one does sadhana the deity often comes =\r\nto observe and make his/her presence felt, even if slightly.=C2&nbsp;It is =\r\nnot an imagination but reality and this can=C2&nbsp;happen not just in a sa=\r\nmshan but in any sadhana anywhere. The idea is to keep doing sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; While offering coconuts into the fire, one coconut rol=\r\nled off from the pyre. So I took a long bamboo stick which the domes use to=\r\n stroke the fire and pushed the coconut piece inside.I wondered if I=C2&nbs=\r\np;had been a dom in any of my past lives, because I strangely felt natural =\r\nstroking the pyre=C2&nbsp;the way the domes do. I even wondered if=C2&nbsp;=\r\nthere was any company which would may me for this kind of a job, I would ha=\r\nppily take it. What better way to do sadhana than become a dom at Manikarki=\r\nna!=C2&nbsp;Interestingly, I then remembered that Manish had bought one ext=\r\nra coconut while buying the samagri to tonight&#39;s homas. Now I understood wh=\r\ny.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; In the middle of the homa, suddenly Manish cal=\r\nled one of the relatives who was standing nearby and told him=C2&nbsp;that =\r\nthe person whos body was in the pyre has just left and that=C2&nbsp;they (r=\r\nelatives) do not have to wait any more. It was already late in the night. T=\r\nhe person did not know what to say. Suddenly Manish explained to him, do no=\r\nt worry, there is nothing evil or bad being done here. We are only praying =\r\nto Ma Durga. I guess the person was mentally wondering about what is going =\r\non. Then another of the relatives came forward and said, &quot;Baba, hum log ahs=\r\nirwad leke hi jayenge&quot;. So Manish said ok and asked them to sit down and co=\r\nntinued with the homa. In the middle of the homa suddenly Manish asked me t=\r\no observe the skin on the corpse=C2&nbsp; I saw the skin on the face had ca=\r\nught fire and was burning. It was a sight to see!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n There is a tradition of pouring Ganges water=C2&nbsp;at the end to finsh t=\r\nhe fire. But I could hear the domes telling the relatives not to pour water=\r\n on the pyre or do anything there without permissin from Manish. Finally at=\r\n the end they came to Manish and=C2&nbsp;asked if they could pour some Gang=\r\nes water. Manish said ok, but in a low voice told me nothing will happen to=\r\n the fire, it won&#39;t die. They poured a large mud kalash full of water but n=\r\nothing happened to the fire. It kept burning. After some times, after some =\r\nmore ahutis, Manish called the people and said, &quot; Devi=C2&nbsp;samne khadi =\r\nhai. App log pranam kijiye&quot;. At least 10/15 people came forward and reventi=\r\nally bowed to the fire. Then they wanted to touch=C2&nbsp;Manish&#39;s feet, bu=\r\nt Manish would not let them do so. They asked for his blessings. He distrib=\r\nuted some flower petals we had and told them to go home, since it was very =\r\nlate in the night. Suddenly the man, who had some doubts (whom Manish had a=\r\nddressed earlier) came&lt;BR&gt;&gt; running with tears in his eyes asking for fo=\r\nrgiveness for having doubted. Manish consoled him, told him nothing to worr=\r\ny, he has done no wrong, everything is all right.=C2&nbsp; Later Manish sai=\r\nd, if it was some other time of the day he would have brought the man along=\r\n for a cup of tea. Another person suddenly came to Manish and asked him if =\r\nhe was a certain saint (a famous saint)=C2&nbsp;who used to live in Kasi. M=\r\nanish without responding to his query asked him where was he from, the pers=\r\non replied interior=C2&nbsp;Bihar. Manish advised him to go back home as it=\r\n was late in the night. The faith of the ordinary people of this land is wh=\r\nat makes India so unique, that is why our land and culture is still so aliv=\r\ne. We city bred &#39;educated&#39;=C2&nbsp;people are too rational to understand th=\r\nese things. God loves the simple and uncalculating. By this time I too stoo=\r\nd up to do pranam to the fire. Immediately I felt as if my body existed onl=\r\ny from my head to my heart, there was nothing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; below, no legs, no st=\r\nomach ,=C2&nbsp;as if=C2&nbsp;I was simply floating on thin=C2&nbsp;air! I =\r\ntold Manish what happened, he just gave a=C2&nbsp;curt one word reply, &quot;Goo=\r\nd&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; As we wer=\r\ne walking back from Manikarnika Manish suddenly said, &quot;There is a foreigner=\r\n lady who lives close to Manikarnika, who has a lot of desire to perform sa=\r\ndhanas in the samshan but does not know how to go about it. I saw her while=\r\n meditating.&quot; For a woman to come and perform these sadhanas is practically=\r\n difficult or impossible, unless she is a Yogini or a sadhaka of great cali=\r\nbre. Ordinary people would not be able to meet the gaze of a Yogini, said M=\r\nanish. The next morning, when we came to the Lalita Ghat (as I mentioned ab=\r\nove), I saw a thin, frail, looking foreigner lady sitting on the banks. Man=\r\nish quitely indicated to me that, that is the lady whom he had seen last ni=\r\nght in his meditation at the samshan. &quot;She has desire, but directionless. &quot;=\r\n At that time there was nothing more we could do. I guess that is why it is=\r\n so important to keep doing some sadhana on your own, instead of merely con=\r\ntemplating which is of no good,=C2&nbsp;so that you are ready when&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nNature decides to give you a push. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; After passing=\r\n the Lalita Ghat, next afternoon,=C2&nbsp;we stood and observed Manikarnika=\r\n from a distance. We were dressed like any other tourist, specially with Ma=\r\nnish&#39;s camera hanging from his neck=C2&nbsp;and the=C2&nbsp;tripod. Manish =\r\nsmiled and said let us not go too close to Manikarnika, what if the doms re=\r\ncognize us! They would be shell shocked seeing us dressed as tourists, wond=\r\nering what is going on.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thus ended my second day =\r\nof observing a Chandi homa on a funeral pyre at the famed Manikarnika Ghats=\r\n of Kashi.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rama Naam Satya Hai&lt;\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
