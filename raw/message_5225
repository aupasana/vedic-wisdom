Ravana brought the Shiva linga from Shiva himself, B=\r\naidyanath Jyotirlinga, whose sacredness is sufficient proof of purity of Ra=\r\nvanas&#39; sadhana and his success with mantras.\n\n   There is a list of Ravanas=\r\n&#39; works:\nhttp://www.ancientindianastrology.com/cmsa/index.php?option=3Dcom_=\r\ncontent&view=3Darticle&id=3D99:ravanas-contributions&catid=3D31:general&Ite=\r\nmid=3D70\n\n   While Ravana is portrayed as a villain in an ethical sense tha=\r\nn any other, he certainly wielded more power, by virtue of his knowledge of=\r\n Veda and Mantra, than all other characters in the story combined except Ha=\r\nnumaan who was Rudra Avatara and used all his divine powers to turn the fac=\r\ne of war.\n\n&gt; But, people like Ravana, Hiranyakashipu etc fell in the end!\n\n=\r\n   Even the city of dwarkapuri fell after Krishna, and Krishna succumbed to=\r\n a mortal wound, but nobody decries his folly that led to this fall.

It is a continuum. As one becomes purer and inc=\r\nreases self-control, one may get some results. Thus, a person still afflict=\r\ned by undesirable conditioning may acquire enough purity to get some result=\r\ns. But, people like Ravana, Hiranyakashipu etc fell in the end!\n&gt;  \n&gt; What =\r\nI called &quot;purity&quot; can also be called &quot;self-control&quot;. Both are not that diff=\r\nerent.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Surrender of slaves is not the surrender I am talking about wh=\r\nen I talk about surrender to god. The instinct of self-preservation is anot=\r\nher aspect of ego. A person with ego and pride may suppress pride and self-=\r\nimportance out of no choice, for self-preservation. If one later gets a cha=\r\nnce to exert one&#39;s pride without sacrificing self-preservation, one may sti=\r\nll do so. This is conditional surrender. In the case of god also, surrender=\r\ning to god when one&#39;s life is a mess and one is helpless may still be condi=\r\ntional surrender. But, when the surrender is unconditional and one sees god=\r\n as the controller of all without any conditions attached, irrespective of =\r\nwhether life is good or bad, one becomes purer and purer and one&#39;s self-con=\r\ntrol become better and better.\n&gt;  \n&gt; A powerless person may also become ang=\r\nry. But, as you said, his anger is powerless to do much harm. As one&#39;s self=\r\n-control increases, one&#39;s tendency to become angry comes down. That increas=\r\nes one&#39;s power. A person who has a perfect self-control like Shiva is infin=\r\nitely powerful. From where we are to there, there is a continuum.

Similarly, a lot of technical=\r\n details of the mantra do not matter much.

I see many in this g=\r\nroup following such discipline and thanks to them. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While this wonderful help is available, I still think we need to =\r\ngive the members something to focus on the Lord in terms of mantras like yo=\r\nu have done Mr. Jay-ji. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is it possible, J=\r\nay-ji, that we have a few simple mantras listed for the benefit of the memb=\r\ners to address the common issues people face, plus to appease the lords of =\r\nthe houses (like Ganesha for ketu, Durga for rahu, Balaji for saturn etc). =\r\nMr. PVRji has listed some, but would be good to develop such list and make =\r\nthem available in one place. I truly believe that would be more useful and =\r\npowerful than prescribing remedies which may or may not work(with possible =\r\nhigh degree of error possibilities in the charts). Bhakti and meditation al=\r\nways would work!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If Mr. PVR or other guruj=\r\nis are reading this, I would appreciate it if they take the leadership to d=\r\nevelop such mantras and circulate for the benefit of the members.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you very much!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; With deep regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Murthy Divakaruni\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jkumarkb&quot; &lt;jkumarkb@&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear All,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chant the below mantra at least 108 times everyday with dee=\r\np belief and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dedication.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Rajagopala Mantram\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Krishna Krishn=\r\na Mah=C3=83?=C3=A2??=C3=83?=C3=82=C2=81yogin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhakt=C3=83?=\r\n=C3=A2??=C3=83?=C3=82=C2=81n=C3=83?=C3=A2??=C3=83?=C3=82=C2=81m Abhayam Kar=\r\na\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Govinda Param=C3=83?=C3=A2??=C3=83?=C3=82=C2=81nanda\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sarvam Me Vasha M=C3=83?=C3=A2??=C3=83?=C3=82=C2=81na Ya !!=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Translation:- Krishna, oh great Yogi,=\r\n you give shelter to your devotees.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh Govinda, You are t=\r\nhe giver of Supreme Bliss.
