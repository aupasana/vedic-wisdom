Kundalini is nothing but one&#39;s self-awareness. Chakras are realms of awar=\r\neness. When self-awareness has some conditioning, different realms of aware=\r\nness have different properties and are different. But, when the self-awaren=\r\ness is perfectly pure and there is no conditioning whatsoever, all realms o=\r\nf awareness are the same. Kundalini may be spontaneously moving through var=\r\nious chakras, but it does not matter.\n \nMany siddhas and vijnanis are not i=\r\nn sahaja samadhi. They may operate with a very limited amount of ego and co=\r\nnditioning. For embodied beings to not have even a little ego and condition=\r\ning is very very tough. Sahaja samadhi is not at all easy to achieve. Only =\r\nsaints of the caliber of Trilinga Swami, Sai Baba, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa,=\r\n Ramana Maharshi were in that state.

Some people reaching nirvikalpa samadhi may not come back, bu=\r\nt some people reaching nirvikalpa samadhi do come back and live their lives=\r\n. In other words, some people jump from the &quot;relative&quot; side of the wall to =\r\nthe &quot;absolute&quot; side and stay there forever, while some people come back to =\r\nthe &quot;relative side&quot; to tell others about it.\n\n          Sahaja samadhi is a=\r\n state where one is simultaneously on both sides and does not even see them=\r\n as two different sides.\n\n          One more thing.. The absolute and the r=\r\nelative are not really two, but one. The relative is just a modification of=\r\n the absolute. Shiva and Shakti are not two, but one. Normally we are in th=\r\ne field of Shakti and not aware of the underlying Shiva (we see various obj=\r\nects, but not the underlying Reality). In nirvikalpa samadhi, one is in the=\r\n field of Shiva and not aware of the Shakti that manifested (i.e. one is ab=\r\nsorbed in the underlying Reality, but not perceiving various objects). In s=\r\nahaja samadhi, one is simultaneously aware of Shiva and Shakti and aware of=\r\n them as One.\n\n          Normally, when the mind is perceiving the objects =\r\nof dual polarities using jnanendriyas and the mind is engaging in actions o=\r\nf dual polarities using karmendriyas, it is difficult to not accumulate any=\r\n conditioning such as likes, dislikes and impressions, and keep the conscio=\r\nusness absorbed in the Absolute.\n\n          Best regards,\n          Narasim=\r\nha\n          ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n -\n          Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ ho=\r\nmam\n          Spirituality writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic-=\r\n wisdom\n          Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rolo=\r\nger.org\n          Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/Jyotish=\r\nWri tings\n          Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.com=\r\ncast. net\n          Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer=\r\n.org/ tarpana\n          ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- --------- -\n\n          ---- vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:=\r\n \n          &gt; Namaste,\n          &gt; \n          &gt; &gt;Let me give another analog=\r\ny.

Vikalpa means existence of variety. Savikalpa means &quot;with vikalpa&quot;.=\r\n Savikalpa samadhi is a state of intense concentration of the mind, while c=\r\nreational variety or objectification still exists in the mind. One perceive=\r\ns that there is an &quot;I&quot; and there are &quot;other&quot; objects (e.g. deities, demons,=\r\n people etc). But one is able to focus the mind intensely on one object (e.=\r\ng. a deity) and able to achieve oneness with that object. Even reaching sav=\r\nikalpa samadhi is a tremendous thing and many great yogis also cannot go be=\r\nyond savikalpa samadhi.\n          &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; In nirvikalpa samadhi,=\r\n the creational variety and objectification ceases (nirvikalpa=3D nir+vikal=\r\npa, nir=3Ddevoid of). Mind reaches a state where there is no perception of =\r\nI and &quot;other&quot; objects. One&#39;s consciousness is absorbed in supreme conscious=\r\nness (Brahman or Aatman), without any perception of a variety of objects. T=\r\nhis state is reached by very very few yogis.\n          &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; S=\r\nahaja samadhi is a state where the mind is *simultaneously* perceiving a va=\r\nriety of objects *and* absorbed in the supreme consciousness!\n          &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n          &gt; &gt; * * *\n          &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; When one is normally per=\r\nceiving a variety objects, one&#39;s mind is absorbed in an *individualized* co=\r\nnsciousness that is colored with the conditioning of that individual&#39;s expe=\r\nriences over various lives. When one sees a beautiful person, one&#39;s mind ma=\r\ny get certain thoughts (depending on the experiences, values and desires ac=\r\ncumulated from many lives). When somebody is praising one, one&#39;s mind may g=\r\net certain thoughts. When somebody is criticizing one, one&#39;s mind may get c=\r\nertain thoughts. And so on. One&#39;s mind has likes, dislikes, attractions, re=\r\npulsions etc, based on the accumulated experiences, values and desires of t=\r\nhat individualized consciousness.\n          &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; In sahaja sa=\r\nmadhi, one has no individualized consciousness and one&#39;s mind is absorbed i=\r\nn the infinite supreme consciousness that is not colored by the experiences=\r\n and conditioning of a single individual. One is actively living in the mat=\r\nerial world; one&#39;s mind is perceiving various objects of various attributes=\r\n through jnanendriyas; and, one&#39;s mind is engaging in various actions in th=\r\ne material world though karmendriyas. Yet, one has no individualized condit=\r\nioning or I-ness.\n          &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; Very very very few beings, m=\r\nostly re-incarnations of rishis and gods, can reach that state.

DRAM has a lot of stored data and=\r\n CPU is refreshing it frequently. ALU is running several algorithms based o=\r\nn stored data and a lot of I/O data gets stored/retrieved from DRAM all the=\r\n time. This is analogous to a person&#39;s normal state.\n          &gt; &gt; \n       =\r\n   &gt; &gt; Nirvikalpa samadhi is like a state where the computer is in a power =\r\nstandby. On-board power supply is hardly supplying any power, all input and=\r\n output channels are turned off, I/O controller is turned off and ALU is no=\r\nt running any algorithms. If a computer goes into power standy and exits it=\r\n quickly, it will resume what it was doing before. Similarly, a person reac=\r\nhing nirvikalpa samadhi and leaving it quickly will resume previous activit=\r\nies. If a computer stays in the power standby for too long, it will be turn=\r\ned off and its state may be lost, i.e. it cannot resume. If one stays in ni=\r\nrvikalpa samadhi for too long, one will simply merge in Brahman and cannot =\r\nresume previous activities.\n          &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; Sahaja samadhi is =\r\nakin to a computer running a bare minimum program that accesses a program r=\r\nunning on a central super computer on a network. CPU, ALU, memory etc are r=\r\nunning on a central super computer and our individual computer&#39;s CPU simply=\r\n has a small routine that accesses the results of the algorithm running on =\r\nthe super computer and controls the local I/O controller accordingly. There=\r\n isn&#39;t much data stored locally and there is no algorithm running locally. =\r\nOne&#39;s praanas are supplying power, one&#39;s jnanendriyas are getting inputs an=\r\nd one&#39;s karmendriyas are engaging in actions, one&#39;s manas is controlling th=\r\nis Input/Ouput activity and ahamkara (CPU) is controlling all this by runni=\r\nng a small program that accesses a super computer that is monitoring all th=\r\ne computers of the world and deciding what this computer should do.\n       =\r\n   &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; * * *\n          &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; As I said, very ve=\r\nry very few beings can reach sahaja samadhi and it is beyond the reach of e=\r\nven the greatest yogis. As I said, most yogis cannot even reach nirvikalpa =\r\nsamadhi. Some reach nirvikalpa samadhi, come back to regular consciousness =\r\nafter a while and start to accumulate conditioning again (chitta, i.e. DRAM=\r\n). The CPU is running some program or the other, however small, and accumul=\r\nating more data in DRAM and building up an algorithm in ALU. Minimization o=\r\nf I-ness is possible, but elimination of I-ness while embodied is very diff=\r\nicult! If any limited I-ness is left and any conditioning (I am this, I nee=\r\nd this, I like this etc) is left, then it is NOT sahaja samadhi. Sahaja sam=\r\nadhi is a lack of limited individual I-ness and connecting the supreme univ=\r\nersal I-ness directly to one&#39;s mind and body.\n          &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; =\r\nI cannot make judgments on individual claims, as it is none of my business.=\r\n I will take on individuals only when they interfere with my dharma and my =\r\nsense of dharma dictates that I should take them on.\n          &gt; &gt; \n       =\r\n   &gt; &gt; But the bottomline is that sahaja samadhi state is no joke and only =\r\nyogis of an absolutely tremendous caliber reach it. Those who reach this st=\r\nate are like the god - supreme cosmic being - himself.\n          &gt; &gt; \n     =\r\n     &gt; &gt; * * *\n          &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; Let me give another analogy.

The a=\r\nbsolute and the relative \n          are not really two, but one. The relati=\r\nve is just a modification of \n          the absolute. Shiva and Shakti are =\r\nnot two, but one. Normally we are \n          in the field of Shakti and not=\r\n aware of the underlying Shiva (we see \n          various objects, but not =\r\nthe underlying Reality). In nirvikalpa \n          samadhi, one is in the fi=\r\neld of Shiva and not aware of the Shakti that \n          manifested (i.e. o=\r\nne is absorbed in the underlying Reality, but not \n          perceiving var=\r\nious objects). In sahaja samadhi, one is simultaneously \n          aware of=\r\n Shiva and Shakti and aware of them as One.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Normally, \n          whe=\r\nn the mind is perceiving the objects of dual polarities using \n          jn=\r\nanendriyas and the mind is engaging in actions of dual polarities \n        =\r\n  using karmendriyas, it is difficult to not accumulate any conditioning \n =\r\n         such as likes, dislikes and impressions, and keep the consciousnes=\r\ns \n          absorbed in the Absolute.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best \n          regards,&lt;BR&gt;N=\r\narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- \n          ---------=\r\n --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://www=\r\n.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http:=\r\n//www.VedicAst rologer.org/ \n          homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality writings: =\r\n&lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D=\r\n_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wis=\r\ndom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free \n          Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://ww=\r\nw.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; \n          target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAst \n          rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jyotish writings: &lt;A \n          hr=\r\nef=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; target=3D_blank \n     =\r\n     rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri \n          t=\r\nings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://vedica=\r\nstro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://ve=\r\ndicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri \n          Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;=\r\nA href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; \n          target=3D_blan=\r\nk rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ \n          tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- \n          --------- =\r\n-&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---- vedic_pathak &lt;&lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.mail.ya=\r\nhoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic_pathak%40yahoo.com&quot; \n          target=3D_blan=\r\nk rel=3Dnofollow \n          ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic_pathak%40yahoo.com&quot;&gt;ved=\r\nic_pathak@ \n          yahoo.com&lt;/A&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;Let me \n          give another analogy.

But one is able to focus the mind intensely on one obj=\r\nect (e.g. \n          a deity) and able to achieve oneness with that object.=\r\n Even reaching \n          savikalpa samadhi is a tremendous thing and many =\r\ngreat yogis also \n          cannot go beyond savikalpa samadhi.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In \n          nirvikalpa samadhi, the creational variety an=\r\nd objectification ceases \n          (nirvikalpa=3D nir+vikalpa, nir=3Ddevoi=\r\nd of). Mind reaches a state where \n          there is no perception of I an=\r\nd &quot;other&quot; objects. One&#39;s consciousness \n          is absorbed in supreme co=\r\nnsciousness (Brahman or Aatman), without any \n          perception of a var=\r\niety of objects. This state is reached by very very \n          few yogis.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sahaja samadhi is a state where \n          the mi=\r\nnd is *simultaneously* perceiving a variety of objects *and* \n          abs=\r\norbed in the supreme consciousness!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * \n       =\r\n   *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; When one is normally perceiving a variety \n=\r\n          objects, one&#39;s mind is absorbed in an *individualized* consciousn=\r\ness \n          that is colored with the conditioning of that individual&#39;s e=\r\nxperiences \n          over various lives. When one sees a beautiful person,=\r\n one&#39;s mind may \n          get certain thoughts (depending on the experienc=\r\nes, values and desires \n          accumulated from many lives). When somebo=\r\ndy is praising one, one&#39;s \n          mind may get certain thoughts. When so=\r\nmebody is criticizing one, one&#39;s \n          mind may get certain thoughts. =\r\nAnd so on. One&#39;s mind has likes, \n          dislikes, attractions, repulsio=\r\nns etc, based on the accumulated \n          experiences, values and desires=\r\n of that individualized \n          consciousness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; In sahaja samadhi, one has \n          no individualized consciousness and=\r\n one&#39;s mind is absorbed in the \n          infinite supreme consciousness th=\r\nat is not colored by the experiences \n          and conditioning of a singl=\r\ne individual. One is actively living in the \n          material world; one&#39;=\r\ns mind is perceiving various objects of various \n          attributes throu=\r\ngh jnanendriyas; and, one&#39;s mind is engaging in \n          various actions =\r\nin the material world though karmendriyas. Yet, one \n          has no indiv=\r\nidualized conditioning or I-ness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          &gt; Ver=\r\ny very very few beings, mostly re-incarnations of rishis and \n          god=\r\ns, can reach that state. For most others, that state is not really \n       =\r\n   a possibility.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n =\r\n         &gt; I gave an analogy earlier to explain various aspects of \n    =\r\n      consciousness, using parts of a computer.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n          ahamkaara (I-ness) - CPU&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; chitta (conditioning) - \n =\r\n         DRAM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; buddhi - ALU or logic coprocessor&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; m=\r\nanas \n          - I/O controller&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; jnanendriyas - input channels=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          &gt; karmendriyas - output channels&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; praana=\r\ns - on-board \n          power supply&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; deha (body) - mechanical =\r\nparts, chassis \n          etc&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Normally, CPU is r=\r\nunning a complex \n          program where a lot of input channels and outpu=\r\nt channels are active. \n          DRAM has a lot of stored data and CPU is =\r\nrefreshing it frequently. ALU \n          is running several algorithms base=\r\nd on stored data and a lot of I/O \n          data gets stored/retrieved fro=\r\nm DRAM all the time. This is analogous \n          to a person&#39;s normal stat=\r\ne.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Nirvikalpa \n          samadhi is like a state=\r\n where the computer is in a power standby. \n          On-board power supply=\r\n is hardly supplying any power, all input and \n          output channels ar=\r\ne turned off, I/O controller is turned off and ALU \n          is not runnin=\r\ng any algorithms. If a computer goes into power standy \n          and exits=\r\n it quickly, it will resume what it was doing before. \n          Similarly,=\r\n a person reaching nirvikalpa samadhi and leaving it quickly \n          wil=\r\nl resume previous activities. If a computer stays in the power \n          s=\r\ntandby for too long, it will be turned off and its state may be lost, \n    =\r\n      i.e. it cannot resume. If one stays in nirvikalpa samadhi for too \n  =\r\n        long, one will simply merge in Brahman and cannot resume previous \n=\r\n          activities.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sahaja samadhi is akin to =\r\na \n          computer running a bare minimum program that accesses a progra=\r\nm \n          running on a central super computer on a network. CPU, ALU, me=\r\nmory etc \n          are running on a central super computer and our individ=\r\nual computer&#39;s \n          CPU simply has a small routine that accesses the =\r\nresults of the \n          algorithm running on the super computer and contr=\r\nols the local I/O \n          controller accordingly. There isn&#39;t much data =\r\nstored locally and there \n          is no algorithm running locally. One&#39;s =\r\npraanas are supplying power, \n          one&#39;s jnanendriyas are getting inpu=\r\nts and one&#39;s karmendriyas are \n          engaging in actions, one&#39;s manas i=\r\ns controlling this Input/Ouput \n          activity and ahamkara (CPU) is co=\r\nntrolling all this by running a small \n          program that accesses a su=\r\nper computer that is monitoring all the \n          computers of the world a=\r\nnd deciding what this computer should \n          do.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; As I \n          said, very very very =\r\nfew beings can reach sahaja samadhi and it is \n          beyond the reach o=\r\nf even the greatest yogis. As I said, most yogis \n          cannot even rea=\r\nch nirvikalpa samadhi. Some reach nirvikalpa samadhi, \n          come back =\r\nto regular consciousness after a while and start to \n          accumulate c=\r\nonditioning again (chitta, i.e. DRAM). The CPU is running \n          some p=\r\nrogram or the other, however small, and accumulating more data \n          i=\r\nn DRAM and building up an algorithm in ALU. Minimization of I-ness is \n    =\r\n      possible, but elimination of I-ness while embodied is very difficult!=\r\n \n          If any limited I-ness is left and any conditioning (I am this, =\r\nI need \n          this, I like this etc) is left, then it is NOT sahaja sam=\r\nadhi. Sahaja \n          samadhi is a lack of limited individual I-ness and =\r\nconnecting the \n          supreme universal I-ness directly to one&#39;s mind a=\r\nnd body.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I cannot make judgments on i=\r\nndividual claims, as it is \n          none of my business. I will take on i=\r\nndividuals only when they \n          interfere with my dharma and my sense =\r\nof dharma dictates that I should \n          take them on.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; But the bottomline is that \n          sahaja samadhi state is no =\r\njoke and only yogis of an absolutely \n          tremendous caliber reach it=\r\n. Those who reach this state are like the \n          god - supreme cosmic b=\r\neing - himself.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * \n          *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; Let me give another analogy. This life is \n          like a lon=\r\ng dream. Saviklapa samadhi is like wakig up *within* the \n          dream. =\r\nNirvikalpa samadhi is like waking up from the dream. Sahaja \n          sama=\r\ndhi is like being in the dream and yet being awake.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n         =\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; This may confuse people, but this analogy shows how \n       =\r\n   complex and difficult sahaja samadhi is. The previous computer analogy \n=\r\n          highlights how things work in a sahaja samadhi, but does not show=\r\n why \n          and how difficult it is.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Best \n =\r\n         regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------=\r\n- \n          --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do a Sh=\r\nort \n          Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/ho=\r\nmam&quot; \n          target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.=\r\norg/ \n          homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A \n    =\r\n      href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank \n    =\r\n      rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; \n          Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic=\r\n-wisdom&quot; \n          target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com=\r\n/ group/vedic- \n          wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3=\r\n): &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_bla=\r\nnk \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; \n          Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;h=\r\nttp://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Jyotish \n          writings=\r\n: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; \n          targ=\r\net=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri \n    =\r\n      tings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A \n      =\r\n    href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3D=\r\nnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          ---------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n          -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha, namaste and \n          pranaams&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; What is sahaja samadhi \n          and how=\r\n is it different from nirvikalpa samadhi?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n          &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; best regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Hari&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          =\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Sri Ravishankar is a fully \n          Enli=\r\nghtened Master living in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sahaj Samadhi all \n        =\r\n  times.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;CLEAR: both; COLOR: white&quot; width=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAr=\r\nial \n  color=3D#000000 size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HT=\r\nML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0124_01CA618E.6A95E860--\r\n\n"}}
