Mr Chopra was talking about how doctors suck people into prescription me=\r\ndicines and how that ruins some people&#39;s lives. That somehow reminded me of=\r\n a story.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sometime back, mother of a young man came to me to show =\r\nhis chart. She was asking about his studies etc. But the chart was brillian=\r\nt from the spiritual point of view. There were many tell-tale combinations.=\r\n I declared, &quot;this is not the chart of a materialistic person, but that of =\r\na sannyasi (ascetic/monk).&quot; She broke down into tears and gave me some back=\r\nground. I found out that he indeed wants to leave material life and his mot=\r\nher does not want him to.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This boy had been calm, peaceful, conten=\r\nted and an introvert since childhood. Oneday in his early teenage days, he =\r\nhad an interesting experience. He was in his room upstairs. His father was =\r\nteaching math to some students downstairs. He was hearing all those voices.=\r\n Suddenly, he stopped hearing anything. He did not hear or see anything for=\r\n a while. His mind was completely blacked out. After a while, his mind retu=\r\nrned to normalcy and he saw and heard everything. But he felt a tremendous =\r\nsense of bliss and contentment then. He was overwhelmed by what he felt the=\r\nn.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He realized that what people pursue as happiness is nothing in =\r\nfront of what he experienced then. He did not want to study or do anything =\r\nanymore. He only wanted to experience that state. His parents became worrie=\r\nd and took him to doctors. Doctors did all kinds of tests on his brain and =\r\nfound nothing. He was also confined to a mental facility for one month. The=\r\ny put him on powerful drugs and kept him under observation. He kept telling=\r\n the doctors that there was nothing wrong with him and that they would not =\r\nunderstand what he experienced. After a month, those doctors concluded he w=\r\nas normal and had no problem. The powerful drugs he received during the mon=\r\nth wreaked havoc on him, but he was not angry or mad at his parents or doct=\r\nors. He says he understands his parents love him and hence they did all thi=\r\ns. He does not want to hurt them. He also says he knows what he wants but d=\r\noes not know how to get it. But he knows that regular studies and regular m=\r\naterial life will not get him what he wants.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When I chatted with h=\r\nim alone, I realized that he is a brilliant young man with clear thinking. =\r\nHe is certainly not a mad person. He just needs someone to show him a spiri=\r\ntual path to make something permanent, which temporarily came to him and le=\r\nft him! To get it permanently now, he needs to do serious sadhana. His pare=\r\nnts also took him to many so-called swamijis, but he was not satisfied with=\r\n the advice given anyone. He started reading Ramana Maharshi and a few othe=\r\nrs and liked some of them. But he is still without a clear direction.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Interestingly, just when I was about to chat with this person after mak=\r\ning his parents leave, my guru Manish called me. He asked me what was going=\r\n on. I mentioned that I was about to talk to a teenager who had a nice char=\r\nt. He asked for the birthdata, checked it out and confirmed my feeling that=\r\n this boy had great spiritual potential.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, the s=\r\nystem we have in place looked at him with suspicion and gave powerful drugs=\r\n to mess up his mind for one full month! He is lucky and survived the ordea=\r\nl. This is a sign of the times we live in that someone who realizes, albeit=\r\n momentarily, the essence of scriptures, is labeled as a mentally disturbed=\r\n person and powerful drugs are given to him, instead of clear spiritual dir=\r\nection to make that realization more permanent.\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Naras=\r\nimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do=\r\n Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirit=\r\nuality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons=\r\n (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windo=\r\nws): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website:=\r\n http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------ \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; _________________________=\r\n________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Get the best of MSN on your mo=\r\nbile\n&gt; &gt; http://clk.atdmt.com/UKM/go/147991039/direct/01/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; || Om Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih=\r\n ||\n&gt; Yahoo!
