I finally got to \n&gt;read a litt=\r\nle from it. I am impressed with this work.\n&gt;\n&gt;The book is called &quot;Invading =\r\nthe Sacred: An Analysis of Hinduism Studies in \n&gt;America&quot; (editors: Krishna=\r\nn Ramaswamy, Antonio de Nicolas and Aditi Banerjee). \n&gt;It has 29 scholarly =\r\narticles organized in 4 sections.\n&gt;\n&gt;Perverted scholars with perverted anti=\r\n-Hindu agendas that look down upon India \n&gt;and Hinduism with a colonial vie=\r\nwpoint have conducted perverted researches in \n&gt;the name of academic freedo=\r\nm at the religious studies departments of western \n&gt;universities, published=\r\n them and gained name and fame, trampling the sacred in \n&gt;the process. Cryi=\r\nng foul or getting frustrated with this will not improve the \n&gt;situation or=\r\n solve the problem. Interested religious scholars have to firmly and \n&gt;pati=\r\nently crtique these works in the same academic style, in order to reclaim \n=\r\n&gt;the rightful place for Hinduism.\n&gt;\n&gt;Several papers in this book do exactly=\r\n that. They take specific works by western \n&gt;scholars and rebut them quite =\r\nwell and show how they are fallacious, hasty, \n&gt;nonsensical or sometimes do=\r\nwnright manipulative or filled with lies.\n&gt;\n&gt;* * *\n&gt;\n&gt;I will just give an e=\r\nxample of the offensive work that was rebutted in this \n&gt;book. [Warning: Th=\r\nose who are sensitive to offensive writings should skip the \n&gt;next three pa=\r\nragraphs.]\n&gt;\n&gt;Jeffrey Kripal from Univ of Chicago visited Ramakrishna Missi=\r\non in West Bengal \n&gt;and did research on Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. Several pe=\r\nople there \n&gt;enthusiastically helped him in the researches. In the end, wha=\r\nt he produced is \n&gt;utterly nonsensical and filled with lies. He published h=\r\nis PhD dissertation \n&gt;without showing it to Ramakrishna Mission people to c=\r\nheck for factual or \n&gt;linguistic inaccuracies. Ramakrishna mission people f=\r\nound out about what he \n&gt;produced only years later, after his book &quot;Kali&#39;s =\r\nChild&quot; based on the PhD \n&gt;dissertation won great acclaim in the West. He wo=\r\nn an award at the Americal \n&gt;Academy of Religion for that book, landed a jo=\r\nb at Harvard and his book was \n&gt;sadly mentioned in the Encyclopedia Britann=\r\nica as the *number one* choice for \n&gt;learning about Ramakrishna.\n&gt;\n&gt;In the =\r\nbook, he portrayed Ramakrishna as a sexually perverted person, a \n&gt;homosexu=\r\nal and a pedophile. He did not know Bengali or Hindi or Sanskrit well \n&gt;and=\r\n did not take help from any Bengali people at the Mission for this work. He=\r\n \n&gt;used his own faulty translations, willful distortions and manipulation o=\r\nf \n&gt;sources to arrive at sensational (and damning) conclusions. For example=\r\n, he \n&gt;translated a word that means &quot;lap&quot; as &quot;genitals&quot;, in the context of =\r\nSwami \n&gt;Brahmananda (spiritual son of Ramakrishna and a young boy then) sit=\r\nting in \n&gt;Ramakrishna&#39;s lap. He translated a word that means &quot;touching soft=\r\nly&quot; as \n&gt;&quot;uncontrollably rubbing sandalpaste on the penises of boys&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;Ev=\r\nen in places where there was no material to mis-translate, he simply \n&gt;spec=\r\nulated! For example, he speculated on the meeting of Totapuri and \n&gt;Ramakri=\r\nshna, in which the naaga sadhu (naked ascetic) Totapuri taught advaita \n&gt;ve=\r\ndanta to Ramakrishna and made him go beyond Mother Kali and experience \n&gt;ni=\r\nrvikalpa samadhi: &quot;What it must have been like for Ramakrishna, a homosexua=\r\nlly \n&gt;oriented man, to be shut away for days in a small hut with another, s=\r\ntark-naked \n&gt;man. Vedanta instruction or not, it was this man&#39;s nudity, and=\r\n more especially, \n&gt;his penis, that normally caught Ramakrishna&#39;s attention=\r\n. How could it not?&quot; \n&gt;Please note that he is not referring to any source a=\r\nnd mis-translating it, but \n&gt;simply speculating based on his perverted agen=\r\nda!\n&gt;\n&gt;* * *\n&gt;\n&gt;If you see the book, you will see many examples of such pse=\r\nudo-scholarship \n&gt;driven by heinous agendas. It is a fact that many pervert=\r\ned people under asuric \n&gt;influences make their livelihood, money and fame l=\r\nying and spreading falsehoods \n&gt;about Hinduism, Hindu deities and Hindu sai=\r\nnts.\n&gt;\n&gt;Those who are not inclined to fight a dharma yuddha against this ma=\r\ny ignore this \n&gt;and go on doing their sadhana. After all, if enough people =\r\ndo sadhana to \n&gt;strengthen sanatana dharma, this kind of things will automa=\r\ntically weaken. \n&gt;However, some scholars engaging these pseudo-scholars aca=\r\ndemically is really \n&gt;required on the ground. We need to give our encourage=\r\nment to the pioneers who \n&gt;are doing this important scholarly rebuttal.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\nBest regards,\n&gt;Narasimha\n&gt;-------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------\n&gt;Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish te=\r\nxtbook,\n&gt;Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tar=\r\npana:\n&gt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/\n&gt;Films that make a difference: http:=\r\n//saraswatifilms.org/\n&gt;Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wi=\r\nsdom\n&gt;Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;----=\r\n------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n \n\n\n      \r\n--0-1221417167-1286863408=:48329\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman,new york,times,serif;fon=\r\nt-size:14pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;I usually donate books by swami vivekanada to schools in =\r\nour cities&lt;br&gt;mostly bakthi yoga, raja yoga, kriya yoga and gnana yoga&lt;br&gt;d=\r\no schools and libraries in usa not have these good books ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 14pt;&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;padding-left: 5px; margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; border-left:=\r\n 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); font-family: times new roman,new york,times,se=\r\nrif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Tahoma&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Aditi Banerjee &lt;baner=\r\njeea@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Mon, October 11, 2010 3:35:42 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weig=\r\nht:\n bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] &quot;Invading the Sacred&quot;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;meta http-equiv=3D&quot;x-dns-prefetch-control&quot; content=3D&quot;off&quot;&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-te=\r\nxt&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&#39;m one of the co-editors of the book.=\r\n Thanks for the messages of support.

It has 29 scholarly articles organized in 4 sections.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Perverted scholars with perverted anti-Hindu agendas that look do=\r\nwn upon India and Hinduism with a colonial viewpoint have conducted pervert=\r\ned researches in the name of academic freedom at the religious studies depa=\r\nrtments of western universities, published them and gained name and fame, t=\r\nrampling the sacred in the process. Crying foul or getting frustrated with =\r\nthis will not improve the situation or solve the problem. Interested religi=\r\nous scholars have to firmly and patiently crtique these works in the same a=\r\ncademic style, in order to reclaim the rightful place for Hinduism.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;Several papers in this book do exactly that. They take specific works by =\r\nwestern scholars and rebut them quite well and show how they are fallacious=\r\n, hasty, nonsensical or sometimes downright manipulative or filled with lie=\r\ns.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will just give an example of the offensive work =\r\nthat was rebutted in this book. [Warning: Those who are sensitive to offens=\r\nive writings should skip the next three paragraphs.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jeffrey Kripal =\r\nfrom Univ of Chicago visited Ramakrishna Mission in West Bengal and did res=\r\nearch on Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. Several people there enthusiastically hel=\r\nped him in the researches. In the end, what he produced is utterly nonsensi=\r\ncal and filled with lies. He published his PhD dissertation without showing=\r\n it to Ramakrishna Mission people to check for factual or linguistic inaccu=\r\nracies. Ramakrishna mission people found out about what he produced only ye=\r\nars later, after his book &quot;Kali&#39;s Child&quot; based on the PhD dissertation won =\r\ngreat acclaim in the West. He won an award at the Americal Academy of Relig=\r\nion for that book, landed a job at Harvard and his book was sadly mentioned=\r\n in the Encyclopedia Britannica as the *number one* choice for learning\n ab=\r\nout Ramakrishna.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;In the book, he portrayed Ramakrishna as a sexual=\r\nly perverted person, a homosexual and a pedophile. He did not know Bengali =\r\nor Hindi or Sanskrit well and did not take help from any Bengali people at =\r\nthe Mission for this work. He used his own faulty translations, willful dis=\r\ntortions and manipulation of sources to arrive at sensational (and damning)=\r\n conclusions. For example, he translated a word that means &quot;lap&quot; as &quot;genita=\r\nls&quot;, in the context of Swami Brahmananda (spiritual son of Ramakrishna and =\r\na young boy then) sitting in Ramakrishna&#39;s lap. He translated a word that m=\r\neans &quot;touching softly&quot; as &quot;uncontrollably rubbing sandalpaste on the penise=\r\ns of boys&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Even in places where there was no material to mis-tran=\r\nslate, he simply speculated! For example, he speculated on the meeting of T=\r\notapuri and Ramakrishna, in which the naaga sadhu (naked ascetic) Totapuri =\r\ntaught advaita vedanta to Ramakrishna and made him go beyond Mother Kali an=\r\nd experience nirvikalpa samadhi: &quot;What it must have been like for Ramakrish=\r\nna, a homosexually oriented man, to be shut away for days in a small hut wi=\r\nth another, stark-naked man. Vedanta instruction or not, it was this man&#39;s =\r\nnudity, and more especially, his penis, that normally caught Ramakrishna&#39;s =\r\nattention. How could it not?&quot; Please note that he is not referring to any s=\r\nource and mis-translating it, but simply speculating based on his perverted=\r\n agenda!&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you see the book, you will see many examp=\r\nles of such pseudo-scholarship driven by heinous agendas. It is a fact that=\r\n many perverted people under asuric influences make their livelihood, money=\r\n and fame lying and spreading falsehoods about Hinduism, Hindu deities and =\r\nHindu saints.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Those who are not inclined to fight a dharma yuddha =\r\nagainst this may ignore this and go on doing their sadhana. After all, if e=\r\nnough people do sadhana to strengthen sanatana dharma, this kind of things =\r\nwill automatically weaken. However, some scholars engaging these pseudo-sch=\r\nolars academically is really required on the ground. We need to give our en=\r\ncouragement to the pioneers who are doing this important scholarly rebuttal=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;----------------------------------=\r\n------------------------&lt;br&gt;Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons=\r\n, Free Jyotish textbook,&lt;br&gt;Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short =\r\nHomam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http=\r\n://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Films that make a difference: &lt;a target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot;&gt;http://saraswatifilms.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Spirituality: &lt;a target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups=\r\n.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/=\r\na&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jyotish writings: &lt;a target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/JyotishWritings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n\n&lt;meta http-equiv=\r\n=3D&quot;x-dns-prefetch-control&quot; content=3D&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n      &lt;=\r\n/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-1221417167-1286863408=:48329--\r\n\n"}}
