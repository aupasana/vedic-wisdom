I am not at all saying \nthat people should not chant veda mantras. They can. But I am pointing out \nthat Veda mantras do not work to their potential these days.\n\nI can clarify using an analogy. Imagine that mantras are the weapons used to \nprotect the mind from enemies (weaknesses). After all, mantra comes from \nmana and tra and does mean &quot;that which protects the mind&quot;.\n\nIf regular mantras are like sticks with which you can beat up enemies, veda \nmantras are like powerful guns with which you can shoot with precision. \nHowever, the correct knowledge related to chanting and experiencing veda \nmantras is pretty much lost today. Though there are people who possess a lot \nof guns, pretty much nobody knows how to shoot a gun. Thus, one who wants to \nuse a gun will have to use it like a stick and beat the enemy with the gun.\n\n*        *        *\n\n&gt; personally, i am in favour of living thru my karmas with consciousness\n&gt; rather than appeasing anything/anyone. the grace of consciousness of\n&gt; savitur is perhaps what all of us are seeking, isn&#39;t it?\n\nI do not want to make a personal comment on you, but want to say something \nin general.\n\nPeople talk about living thru karmas with consciousness, about surrendering \nand going through the fruits of karmas with a stable mind etc. But these \nthings are easier to talk about than to actually do. When the fruit of a \nreally bad karma strikes, then it will be difficult to maintain the same \nattitude and mental stability. One can be shaken. Being able to live through \nthe fruits of *any* karma with a stable and unpertubed mind is indeed the \ngoal of all. One can get there only after burning/exhausting several \nblocking karmas.\n\nWith some sadhana, some tranquility and stability of mind comes. That \nenables one to do better and more focussed sadhana. That increases the \ntranquility and stability of mind. That enables one to do even better \nsadhana. This slowly picks up and eventually one reaches the state where one \ncan simply live through the fruits of *any* karma without any impact on the \nequanimity and stability of mind. Before that, serious sadhana is needed.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;vinita kumar&quot; &lt;vinitakuma@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, January 07, 2009 4:00 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: gayatri mantra\n\n\n&gt; namaste narasimhaji,\n&gt;\n&gt; thankyou. your words are always very inspiring.\n&gt;\n&gt; yes, u are right that what u had recorded was just the humming of ups\n&gt; and downs of the mantra to show the intonation. it stuck in my memory\n&gt; because it was very different from the mantra i have heard recorded by\n&gt; various people.\n&gt;\n&gt; there may not be any perfect rendering of the mantra in the present\n&gt; times...but still one longs for something closer to the real\n&gt; thing...whatever that may be.\n&gt;\n&gt; so the search continues....\n&gt;\n&gt; personally, i am in favour of living thru my karmas with consciousness\n&gt; rather than appeasing anything/anyone. the grace of consciousness of\n&gt; savitur is perhaps what all of us are seeking, isn&#39;t it?\n&gt;\n&gt; however, having a very very rudimentary &quot;knowledge&quot; of astrology i\n&gt; sometimes indulge my imagination in thinking that with a retro mars,\n&gt; saturn and mercury my karmas must be rather &quot;jatil&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; you mentioned about lord subramanya. carrying the imagination a lttle\n&gt; further, i find an echo of lord subramnaya in the krittika nakshatra\n&gt; which is the lagna nakshatra. there is also (imaginatively speaking)\n&gt; perhaps some connection to have jupiter, sun and mars on the adra -\n&gt; mool (rahu-ketu) axis or guru-soul-karma axis?\n&gt;\n&gt; Personally, i dont have any god i can visualise while meditating\n&gt; though i feel an affinity to shiva sometimes. yesterday while doing\n&gt; the gayatri mantra i tried to visualise gayatri and for some reason\n&gt; that made me think about love and mother.... and that made me cry.\n&gt;\n&gt; sorry, i may be getting carried away...so i will stop here.\n&gt;\n&gt; many thanks once again!\n&gt;\n&gt; love and best wishes...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Veda mantras are in a different league compared to other mantras. As\n&gt; I said\n&gt;&gt; earlier, it is possible to achieve the one-pointed focus of mind on any\n&gt;&gt; combination of sounds. When one&#39;s mind repeats the same combination of\n&gt;&gt; sounds over and over again, eventually one&#39;s mind may lose all other\n&gt;&gt; thoughts and become absorbed in that combination of sounds. THEN\n&gt; one&#39;s mind\n&gt;&gt; experiences the energy represented by that combination of sounds.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Different combinations of sounds have different energies. But\n&gt; experiencing\n&gt;&gt; the energy of any combination of sounds is a better experience for\n&gt; the mind\n&gt;&gt; than the regular chaotic experiences mind has in a cacaphony of\n&gt; thoughts.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The energy represented by properly chanted Veda mantras is in a\n&gt; different\n&gt;&gt; league. However, it is almost impossible to chant Veda mantras\n&gt; perfectly in\n&gt;&gt; today&#39;s times. The knowledge is lost. The way people chant them, veda\n&gt;&gt; mantras get corrupted and they end up working like other mantras and\n&gt; do not\n&gt;&gt; really act as veda mantras. Even if one experiences a veda mantra, one\n&gt;&gt; experiences the energy of a corrupted version and not of the\n&gt; original veda\n&gt;&gt; mantra.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The expression &quot;Om bhur bhuvah suvah/svah&quot; is not part of the actual\n&gt; savitru\n&gt;&gt; gayatri mantra. The actual veda mantra starts with &quot;tat savitur&quot; and\n&gt; ends\n&gt;&gt; with &quot;prachodayaat&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I never recorded an audio clip of my Gayatri chanting. I only hummed\n&gt; the ups\n&gt;&gt; and downs to show the intonation. I was instructed to never chant\n&gt; Savitru\n&gt;&gt; Gayatri mantra loud. Spiritually speaking, that mantra is my food\n&gt; and I get\n&gt;&gt; whatever little energy I have from it. In order to continue doing my\n&gt; dharma\n&gt;&gt; in the world, I will need to be selfish with my food. I can share\n&gt; everything\n&gt;&gt; else with the world.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Astrology knowledge that we have on earth today is insufficient to give\n&gt;&gt; perfect guidance. A good guru may be able to do a better job than\n&gt; astrology\n&gt;&gt; as we understand it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have seen my guru make some interesting mantra suggestions. For\n&gt; example, I\n&gt;&gt; once mentioned to Manish a friend who visits me often and meditates\n&gt; when I\n&gt;&gt; do homam. Manish said, &quot;he will not be interested in doing homam by\n&gt; himself.\n&gt;&gt; If at all he does, it will not be Mahaganapathi homam or Chandi\n&gt; homam. Teach\n&gt;&gt; him Vishnu sahasra naama homam. He MAY be interested in that. He\n&gt; will like\n&gt;&gt; Vishnu sahasra naama stotram.&quot; I had not mentioned much about that\n&gt; person to\n&gt;&gt; Manish and only said the name. Interestingly, Vishnu sahasra naama\n&gt; stotra is\n&gt;&gt; indeed a favorite prayer of that person. Another time, I met a\n&gt; person who\n&gt;&gt; loves Ganapathi atharva seersham and chants it everyday and\n&gt; interested in\n&gt;&gt; doing Mahaganapathi homam. Manish told me, &quot;if he wants, he can do\n&gt;&gt; Mahaganapathi homam. But eventually there is another sadhana he\n&gt; needs to do.\n&gt;&gt; He needs to chant Hanuman Chalisa everyday 108 or 54 times for one\n&gt; whole\n&gt;&gt; year. It will transform his life.&quot; I had not mentioned anything\n&gt; about that\n&gt;&gt; person to Manish. Interestingly, when this person was young, he was\n&gt; a sishya\n&gt;&gt; of a great spiritual master in the lineage of Sadguru Samartha Ramadas\n&gt;&gt; (considered to be born with  Lord Hanuman&#39;s amsa). He said to me\n&gt; later that\n&gt;&gt; his guru had also advised him in the past to just stick to Hanuman\n&gt; chalisa!\n&gt;&gt; Interestingly, the same suggestion came to Manish&#39;s mind.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Of course, Manish tells me at other times that he knows nothing and\n&gt; says\n&gt;&gt; whatever comes to his mind. If he ends up giving correct guidance to\n&gt;&gt; someone, he says it is because the Mother wanted someone to get correct\n&gt;&gt; guidance and he is just a nimitta.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I believe that a sadguru with very limited individual ego and in\n&gt; tune with\n&gt;&gt; Nature will be able to give far better guidance in spiritual sadhana\n&gt; than\n&gt;&gt; astrology as we know it today.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; For Mars and Rahu in 8th, I can suggest Lord Subrahmanya.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;vinita kumar&quot; &lt;vinitakuma@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Sunday, January 04, 2009 3:45 AM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] gayatri mantra\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; dear narasimha ji and friends,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; namaste!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; i understand that the syllables / metre of the mantra is very\n&gt;&gt; &gt; important. that is why (probably) mantra was passed on from the guru\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to ths sishya by word of mouth. somebody even said that in the end\n&gt;&gt; &gt; it is the metre only that remains in the mantra...and not even the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; words. something like the smile of the cheshire cat remaining even\n&gt;&gt; &gt; when the cat itself vanishes in alice in the wonderland.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; i too have been looking at / bringing to my consciousness the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; gayatri mantra of late. for lack of guidance, i have been relying on\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the internet. the first thing that kind of took my breath away was\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the layers and layers of meaning attached to each word of the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; mantra. that is probably because all sanskrit words are like\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that....you peel one layer and another layer lies below..and then\n&gt;&gt; &gt; still another and another....\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; but more importantly (perhaps) is the different ways this mantra\n&gt;&gt; &gt; gets recited. i tried to count the syllables to see whether they\n&gt;&gt; &gt; added upto 24. they almost did, to my recknoning, but i wasn&#39;t sure\n&gt;&gt; &gt; whether om in the beginning is part of the mantra or not. it probaly\n&gt;&gt; &gt; is, but i want to be sure.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; secondly, depending on who chants the mantra, the words\n&gt;&gt; &gt; are &quot;spelt&quot; / &quot;pronounced&quot; differently. For instance in one\n&gt;&gt; &gt; rendering i found &quot;swah&quot; being pronounced as &quot;suvah&quot; which becomes\n&gt;&gt; &gt; two syllables instead of one. simarly, in the same\n&gt;&gt; &gt; rendering &quot;prachodyat&quot; is stretched to 3 syllables instead of 2.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; so i am confused as to the &quot;right&quot; rendition.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; i recall, quite some time back, narsimha ji had posted his rendition\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of the gayatri mantra in an audio clip. i have not been able to find\n&gt;&gt; &gt; it again. but i wish he or someone could guide me about this.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; i would also like to know the importance of the number of syllables\n&gt;&gt; &gt; in each mantra and how this is suitable for different persons\n&gt;&gt; &gt; depending on their &quot;karmic structures&quot; which are sometimes / always\n&gt;&gt; &gt; (?) reflected in the astrological chart. maybe a guru by just\n&gt;&gt; &gt; looking at a person can know intuitively what is the &quot;right&quot; mantra\n&gt;&gt; &gt; for the person. maybe a good astrologer can also do the same.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; i know this is not an astrology forum, but still i am seeking\n&gt;&gt; &gt; guidance on &quot;appeasement&quot; of mars and rahu in 8th house and retro\n&gt;&gt; &gt; saturn in 6th house for taurus lagna...throough mantra. These\n&gt;&gt; &gt; planets aspect all the other planets (jupiter, sun and mercury in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 2nd house and venus moon in third house).\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; thankyou!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; love and best wishes,&#39;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; vinita\n\n\n"}}
