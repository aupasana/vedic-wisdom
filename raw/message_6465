Rajasic will give you more=\r\n attachment. Satavik will give you right direction.\n\nIn my opinion it becom=\r\nes imperative for anyone to achieve this internal harmony asap so that the =\r\ntrue sadhana can start. \n\n* * *\n\nUltimately all this doesnt matter if you h=\r\nave crossed a certain threshold within when you have generated a strong rel=\r\nationship with a diety. It has to be strong relationship for which you will=\r\n have to do sadhana. At that time that Diety fills the space of your consci=\r\nousness and at that time all the other centers of consciousness (planets/gu=\r\nnas) will be all in harmony.\n\n* * * \n\nnow the important question for me is =\r\nhow to reach that threshold point where your gunas/planets/consciousness ge=\r\nts balanced/harmonised.\nnow most of the people. \n\nAns a - Do homam daily fo=\r\nr your ishta diety, thats the most powerful way.\n\n\nAns b- (In case you are =\r\nnot able to homam)\nFollowing is my based on my limited understanding\n\n1. Ch=\r\noose one isht dev and chant his mantras as much as possible. \n2. Chant om a=\r\nim hrim shrim atleast 108 times twice daily(this will balance the 3 gunas d=\r\nirectly)\n3. Add navarna mantra 108 times twice daily so that the tamasic gu=\r\nna gets balanced asap.\n\n* * *\n\nThe most important thing remains the develop=\r\nment of Devotion/Bhav and \nseeing/feeling ur ishta devata in everything aro=\r\nund.\n\n\nall comments/pointers welcome \n\nregards\npriyank\n\n\n"}}
