The purpose behind =\r\nall this should be to free oneself from karmic bindings and be free of the =\r\n=C2=A0bondage. That has to be the core purpose of any type of yoga.

With respect =\r\nto our mental state where we are attached to our thoughts it is of course r=\r\neal.How does this perceptual leap comes about ...and is it a matter of time=\r\n?? I am not sure if it is a matter of time or practice. It is an error in p=\r\nerception where we identify with our thoughts and act out. Does these yogas=\r\n help see this and come out of this error?? Can all karma be ended in an in=\r\nstant with the help of a perception and how that can be brought about...are=\r\n I think are the most fundamental questions. Right now humanity is creating=\r\n more karma while trying to liberate extricate itself out of it....the whol=\r\ne thing is moving in a circular way.=C2=A0\n\nJust put my line of thought out=\r\n there...i may not be right. =C2=A0\n\n\n________________________________\n Fro=\r\nm: Narasimha P.V.R.

It is very much\n&gt; possible and in fa=\r\nct is a measure of self realized people.\n=C2=A0\nIndeed, one can carve one&#39;s=\r\n own niche by combining multiple paths. They are not meant to be mutually e=\r\nxclusive.\n=C2=A0\nI&#39;ll quote Swami Vivekananda from his book &quot;Raja Yoga&quot; whe=\r\nre he makes a comment on the 4 paths:\n=C2=A0\n&quot;Each soul is potentially divi=\r\nne. The goal is to manifest this divinity\n within by controlling\n nature: e=\r\nxternal and internal. Do this either by work or worship or psychic control,=\r\n or philosophy - by one, or more, or all of these - and be free.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nHe=\r\nre are my 2 cents.\n=C2=A0\nJnana yoga emphasizes on philosophization and wis=\r\ndom. Karma yoga emphasizes on work and detachment. Raja yoga emphasizes on =\r\nself-control and self-mastery. Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devotion and surre=\r\nnder to Supreme. One can pick whatever is natural to one and try to develop=\r\n that quality. However, wisdom, detached action, self-control and surrender=\r\n to the Supreme are not mutually exclusive. As one of these qualities devel=\r\nops nicely in one, others will automatically develop too! Finally, a realiz=\r\ned person (i.e. one in &quot;Yoga&quot; or oneness) will have all these qualities ful=\r\nly blossomed.\n=C2=A0\nForget about horoscope, navamsa, vimsamsa, nakshatrams=\r\na etc. Irrespective of that, I strongly recommend against Raja yoga for 99%=\r\n of humanity. Even Ramakrishna advised\n against it. Controlling body and mi=\r\nnd and forcing the psychic life force to purify and ascend requires strict =\r\nyama and niyama and clean nadis. In this age of polluted air, water and foo=\r\nd, nadis accumulate great amounts of obstructions and Raja yoga can be dang=\r\nerous. This is not just my view, but what Ramakrishna explicitly taught in =\r\n&quot;Gospel of Ramakrishna&quot; (one of the greatest spiritual texts IMHO). He disc=\r\nouraged several of his sishyas from pursuing Raja Yoga. He taught it to Viv=\r\nekananda, but did not encourage even him to practice it.\n=C2=A0\nJnana yoga =\r\nis brilliant, but there is a distinct danger of falling into the delusional=\r\n trap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this age are not sincere/honest/smart eno=\r\nugh for it. It is easy to delude that &quot;all is Brahman. I am Brahman. Whatev=\r\ner I do, it&#39;s ok - it doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s all a delusion anyway&quot; without f=\r\nully overcoming all innate conditioning that reinforces duality in consciou=\r\nsness every instant. Kind\n of like declaring wisely in a movie that &quot;it&#39;s j=\r\nust a movie and not reality&quot;, but flinching in every scary scene, crying in=\r\n every sad scene etc. Without absolute honesty, sincerely and earnestness, =\r\njnana yoga can be problematic too. A long path of constant contemplation an=\r\nd self-correction can be reduced to a quick delusional jump to the end.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nIMHo, for most people in this age, Bhakti yoga and Karma yoga are the m=\r\nost suitable and safest.\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology =\r\n& Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org \n--------\n=C2=A0\n-=\r\n-- In sohamsa@yahoogroups.com, Vishnu Jandhyala &lt;jvishnu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; De=\r\nar Ms. Maja,\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste\n&gt; \n&gt; Now different type of 4 yogas based on ayana=\r\n/kendra:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dharma ayana - Gyana yoga- lagna and its trines\n&gt;\n &gt; Artha=\r\n ayana - Karma yoga -\n 10th bhava and its trines\n&gt; &gt; Kama ayana - Raja yoga=\r\n- 7th bhava and its trines\n&gt; &gt; Moksha ayana - Bhakti yoga - 4th bhava and i=\r\nts trines\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; These 4 yogas are listed in Bhagavat Gita, you can check =\r\nit, I assure\n&gt; &gt; there are four of them.

It is very much&lt;br&gt;&gt; possible and in fact is a=\r\n measure of self realized people.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, one can carve one&#39;s =\r\nown niche by combining multiple paths. They are not meant to be mutually ex=\r\nclusive.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ll quote Swami Vivekananda from his book &quot;Raja Yoga=\r\n&quot; where he makes a comment on the 4 paths:&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Each soul is poten=\r\ntially divine. The goal is to manifest this divinity\n within by controlling=\r\n\n nature: external and internal. Do this either by work or worship or psych=\r\nic control, or philosophy - by one, or more, or all of these - and be free.=\r\n&quot;&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Here are my 2 cents.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Jnana yoga emphasizes on p=\r\nhilosophization and wisdom. Karma yoga emphasizes on work and detachment. R=\r\naja yoga emphasizes on self-control and self-mastery. Bhakti yoga emphasize=\r\ns on devotion and surrender to Supreme. One can pick whatever is natural to=\r\n one and try to develop that quality. However, wisdom, detached action, sel=\r\nf-control and surrender to the Supreme are not mutually exclusive. As one o=\r\nf these qualities develops nicely in one, others will automatically develop=\r\n too! Finally, a realized person (i.e. one in &quot;Yoga&quot; or oneness) will have =\r\nall these qualities fully blossomed.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Forget about horoscope, n=\r\navamsa, vimsamsa, nakshatramsa etc. Irrespective of that, I strongly recomm=\r\nend against Raja yoga for 99% of humanity. Even Ramakrishna advised\n agains=\r\nt it. Controlling body and mind and forcing the psychic life force to purif=\r\ny and ascend requires strict yama and niyama and clean nadis. In this age o=\r\nf polluted air, water and food, nadis accumulate great amounts of obstructi=\r\nons and Raja yoga can be dangerous. This is not just my view, but what Rama=\r\nkrishna explicitly taught in &quot;Gospel of Ramakrishna&quot; (one of the greatest s=\r\npiritual texts IMHO). He discouraged several of his sishyas from pursuing R=\r\naja Yoga. He taught it to Vivekananda, but did not encourage even him to pr=\r\nactice it.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Jnana yoga is brilliant, but there is a distinct da=\r\nnger of falling into the delusional trap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this a=\r\nge are not sincere/honest/smart enough for it. It is easy to delude that &quot;a=\r\nll is Brahman. I am Brahman. Whatever I do, it&#39;s ok - it doesn&#39;t matter. It=\r\n&#39;s all a delusion anyway&quot; without fully overcoming all innate conditioning =\r\nthat reinforces duality in consciousness every instant. Kind\n of like decla=\r\nring wisely in a movie that &quot;it&#39;s just a movie and not reality&quot;, but flinch=\r\ning in every scary scene, crying in every sad scene etc. Without absolute h=\r\nonesty, sincerely and earnestness, jnana yoga can be problematic too. A lon=\r\ng path of constant contemplation and self-correction can be reduced to a qu=\r\nick delusional jump to the end.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;IMHo, for most people in this =\r\nage, Bhakti yoga and Karma yoga are the most suitable and safest.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality =\r\nResources: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicas=\r\ntrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;--- In sohamsa@yahoogroups.com, Vishnu Jandhyala &lt;jvishnu@...&gt; wrote=\r\n:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Dear Ms. Maja,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Namaste&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nNow different type of 4 yogas based on ayana/kendra:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; Dharma ayana - Gyana yoga- lagna and its trines&lt;br&gt;&gt;\n &gt; Artha aya=\r\nna - Karma yoga -\n 10th bhava and its trines&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Kama ayana - Raja=\r\n yoga- 7th bhava and its trines&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Moksha ayana - Bhakti yoga - 4=\r\nth bhava and its trines&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; These 4 yogas are listed =\r\nin Bhagavat Gita, you can check it, I assure&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; there are four of=\r\n them.
