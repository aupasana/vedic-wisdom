But that is not\n&gt; the case here.  In real life finding one detached person is so\n&gt; difficult, getting two detached people is nearly impossible.\n\nHere&#39;s a snippet from one of Narasimha&#39;s old posts. I have put in bold\nwhat I think is most relevant to the present quandary:\n\n&gt; If A gets an opportunity to pay back a bad thing to B but resists the\n&gt; temptation, then the payback is postponed. A will get a similar\n&gt; opportunity later (possibly in another life). At that time, he can \n&gt; either do the bad thing to B or resist the temptation again and\n&gt; postpone further. If A becomes a jeevanmukta by then, i.e. one who is\n&gt; liberated while living and engaging in actions without any sense of\n&gt; I-ness, then he can pay back the bad thing without incurring further\n&gt; karmas. *If A got moksha and got out of the game, then A is fine but B\n&gt; still has that karma pending. Nature will find a substitute to pay\n&gt; back this karma to B*. That person will get an opportunity to do the\n&gt; bad thing to B.\n\nMy understanding of this is that, if a liberated person performs an\naction, then the phala/rna associated with that action belongs to the\nuniverse/Nature (since they identify with nothing less) and not to them\nindividually. Thus the rna owed by the second (unliberated) person is\nowed not to the first individual, but to the universe/Nature. The\nuniverse/Nature will find a way for them to have to repay it. But the\nfirst person will not have to be there at the time. Thus they are free\nof any karma associated with the exchange.\n\nIf both persons were not liberated, then presumably the rna would be\nspecifically between the two of them, and they would have to meet again.\n\nJust my two cents - feel free to ignore :)\n\nBest wishes,\n\nSamir\n\n"}}
