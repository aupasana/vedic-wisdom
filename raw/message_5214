I heard that great ancient indian astronomers like Ar=\r\nyabhatta and Varahamihira have taken one Yojana to be of 4 miles length. Ho=\r\nwever, in the recent past people have preferred 8 miles as equivalent of on=\r\ne Yojana. Why is it so?\n\nI will be very happy if learned members can enligh=\r\nten me on this.\n\nThanks,\nRajmohan\n\n\n"}}
