Each veda has\nit&#39;s very own &quot;pronunciation guide&quot;, and even among adherents of a given\nstyle, the actual pronunciation varies regionally. Some people, out of an\nabundance of faith, believe that all of these methods are perfect and defect\nfree. However, some others, who have some Sanskrit background, take a step\nback and confidently say that &quot;none of these methods are perfect&quot;. For the\nmost part, the &quot;truth&quot; lies somewhere in the middle, where all the various\nstyles intersect.\n\nThe page referenced below prescribes the &quot;Tamil Nadu&quot; style as the correct\none, and over-emphasizes some aspects of that style. I disagree with it in a\nfew places:\n\n(a) The author keeps trying to &quot;emphasize&quot; some letters (long vowels,\naccents, conjunct letters), which is the wrong approach. One should try to\npronounce ALL letters clearly, rather than trying to &quot;emphasize&quot; some\nletters over another.\n\n(b) I have to disagree with almost the entirety of the section on &quot;visarga\npronounciation&quot;. Visarga can never become &quot;fa&quot;. There is no such sound in\nSanskrit.\n\n(c) There is a tendency to have &quot;two levels&quot; of anudAtta when there is a\nsequence of them. The chanters try to emphasize the last one by lowering it\neven more. Actually the problem here is not with the &quot;last letter&quot;, but with\nall the letters that precede it ! Since they are usually pronounced badly,\npeople try to over-emphasize the last one. Rather than over-emphasizing this\nletter, we should strive to pronounce all previous accents correctly.\n\nThe best thing to do is to try and listen to &quot;vedic chanting experts&quot; from a\nvariety of places in India. Especially for people from South India, it is\nreally worth paying close attention to the pronunciation of experts from\nMaharashtra.\n\nsasneham,\n\n   ajit\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Sat, Sep 10, 2011 at 8:46 AM, Ananda Kishora Dadi\n&lt;varaha_2000@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  http://grd-iyers.web.officelive.com/TIPS_FOR_GOODCHANTING_RECITATION.aspx\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; One of the tip is keep listening to mantra&#39;s receited properly by admired\n&gt; people like Narasimha attentively, over a period of time mind automatically\n&gt; tunes to that pronounciation.\n&gt;\n&gt; God bless you,\n&gt; Ananda\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\r\n--bcaec53961368b963504ac9ace35\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nnamaste,&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There are many different &quot;correct&quot; wa=\r\nys of chanting mantras.
