This is quite true of to-day`s society.   Taboos associated with menstruation , I understand, was prevalent in most of the religions. Most cultures have some kind of &quot;menstruation taboos&quot;for girls and women&quot;.  In many cultures a menstruating woman is considered &quot;unclean&quot; and taboos were imposed. To-day   many people hold that they are obsolete and should not be practised as they can cause serious emotional trauma to woman. \n\n  Among the ancient Greeks, I understand that one author by name Pliny wrote that menstrual blood  could turn new wine sour, render crops barren,dull the gleam of ivory,drive dogs mad , and even cause very tiny creatures to turn away in disgust from a grain of corn that had suffered contact with the offending woman. The great religions that developed with the rise of civilization tended to further these ideas in religious texts and doctorines. Zoroastrianism places purity as one of the most important tenets in the upholding of the faith. It prohibits   women during their menses and priests with bleeding sores  from entering the fire temple. I remember to have read somewhere that in the biblical Book of Levictus   it has been stated that a menstruating woman is considered as unclean for seven days and anyone who touched her would also be unclean. Orthodox jews relegated bleeding woman to their own secluded sphere or enjoined them to abstain from sexual\n contacts for seven days, followed by immersionin the mikveh or ritual bath. In early Syrian Christian texts as well as the writing of Origen, a woman undergoing menses were prohibited, like their jewish counterparts, from entering church or&quot;mixing&quot; reproductive blood with sacrificial blood at the Altar.  Such taboos are existing in countires like Ghana, venezula etc. etc.\n\n As Hindus if we accept  our Sastras  as pramana(authority)  we need to follow what is stated in  our Sastras. If one  has no faith in Scriptures, he or she  is free to do what heor she  thinks is right.\nG.Balasubramanian\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\nFrom: fourwalk &lt;dileepan@...&gt;\nTo: USBrahmins@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Thursday, August 27, 2009 1:11:34 PM\nSubject: [USBrahmins] Re: Rishipanchami/menstruation in ladies.\n\n   \n--- In USBrahmins@yahoogro ups.com, shivashankara rao &lt;shivashankararao@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Please refer to Swami Bharati Krishna Tirtha&#39;s book on &quot;Sanatana Dharma&quot; published by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan wherein he provides details of the research conducted in the United States on several women in Menses.\n&gt; He states that The blood of the woman in menses generally contains a poisonous substances known as &quot;menotoxin&quot; and it harms any one going near her within a distance of 8 feet. \n\nTwo questions arise in my mind:\n[1] Why does this not affect the women themselves considering the harmful effect extends to a space of 8 feet around the menstruating woman?\n[2] Most other societies around the world do not practice this taboo, yet the health outcomes of many of them are far superior to that of India.
