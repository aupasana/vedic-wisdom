Though we=\r\n sometimes use the words yajna and homa exchangably, they are quite differe=\r\nnt. A yajna is bigger in scale, has many many strict rules and is performed=\r\n to achieve some specific goals and performed only occasionally. A homa can=\r\n be big or small, more flexible with rules and can be performed as a spirit=\r\nual sadhana on a daily or weekly basis.\n \nMy manual is only for those who w=\r\nant *internal* purification and upliftment in the presence of a god in live=\r\n external fire every morning. If someone has specific *external* goals (e.g=\r\n. getting control over a person, defeating an enemy, killing a person, achi=\r\neving wealth, getting a child etc), it is doable but a lot of rules are imp=\r\nosed on the procedure and it is not easy to learn. I am *not* serving such =\r\npeople with the manual.\n \n&gt; we should follow the methods given in the origi=\r\nnal Homa procedure.\n \nWell, there isn&#39;t really any single &quot;original Homa pr=\r\nocedure&quot;. There is a set of several procedures that are used in several tra=\r\nditions for several purposes. All procedures given when there are specific =\r\ntasks involved have some complications and inappropriate to spread on the i=\r\nnternet.\n \nHowever, there are some simple homam procedures used in the past=\r\n as a *daily spiritual sadhana* and the &quot;short&quot; procedure in the manual is =\r\none of them.\n \n&gt; Fire or Agni is pure.\n \nAnd, Agni is *not* to be feared. A=\r\ngni is to be loved, as he can be used as a medium for invoking divine prese=\r\nnce to purify oneself.\n \nNeither Agni nor the god in Agni is to be feared. =\r\nIf one is asking for a specific external goal, one better be prepared for p=\r\nunishment when something is messed up. But, when one only loves god and Agn=\r\ni and only wants to purify oneself in god&#39;s presence in Agni, I declare wit=\r\nh confidence that there is *nothing* to fear. Any homam procedure one uses =\r\nfrom the manual or elsewhere will only help one in that case.\n \n&gt; I am clos=\r\ning this discussion.\n \nThank you for bringing up some points which enabled =\r\nme to write things that I did not get a chance to write before.

If one eats=\r\n a delicious\n&gt; feast once every year or six months and starves at other tim=\r\nes,\n&gt; what good is it? Will it give one much strength?\n&gt; \n&gt; On the other ha=\r\nnd, if I tell someone to boil lentils (dal) and rice and\n&gt; eat them with a =\r\npinch of salt, one will be able to make it everyday\n&gt; and eat it. It may no=\r\nt be too delicious, but it will taste good and\n&gt; will give one strength for=\r\n sure.\n\n&gt; The instruction we received was to spread a very simple\n&gt; Mahagan=\r\napathi homam procedure that can be done everyday by\n&gt; busy people of this a=\r\nge. Homam is a very efficient sadhana.\n&gt; Everything is impure in kali yuga,=\r\n but fire is always pure.\n&gt; Worshipping Ganapathi in fire every morning has=\r\n an amazing\n&gt; cleansing effect on one. However, any spiritual sadhana needs=\r\n\n&gt; regularity for effectiveness.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have performed long homas, like an =\r\n8-hour long Mahaganapathi\n&gt; homam and a 12-hour long Chandi homam. I have a=\r\nlso performed\n&gt; short homas on a regular basis, like a 45-minute long daily=\r\n\n&gt; Mahaganapathi homam and a 2-hour long daily Chandi homam.\n&gt; My experienc=\r\ne is that a regular practice does much more to one\n&gt; than a one-off biggie.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW, the 45 minute long &quot;short&quot; procedure I taught in the manual\n&gt; is=\r\n quite close to an authentic and perfect procedure. Regarding the\n&gt; 15-20 m=\r\ninute long &quot;super-short&quot; procedure, we too are not too\n&gt; excited by it. But=\r\n we feel that something is better than nothing and\n&gt; that this will be a st=\r\nepping stone to the other 45-minute procedure\n&gt; for a lot of people that ar=\r\ne going to come and benefit from homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; So many saintly souls are born=\r\n into challenging circumstances in\n&gt; this age and a great amount of bad kar=\r\nmas is accumulated in the\n&gt; mad rush of this age. The amount of sadhana tha=\r\nt is needed to\n&gt; burn those karmas is difficult to manage within the limite=\r\nd time\n&gt; most people allocate to spiritual sadhana in this age. Worship\n&gt; u=\r\nsing an external fire is of great help and accelerates the\n&gt; process of bur=\r\nning karmas and cleansing self.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some higher beings have decided that s=\r\neveral spiritually inclined\n&gt; souls are to come to earth in the coming year=\r\ns and benefit from\n&gt; a regular practice of Mahaganapathi homam. They instru=\r\ncted my\n&gt; guru to spread a short Mahaganapathi homam procedure. The\n&gt; divin=\r\ne Mother also appeared to him and clarified that instruction.\n&gt; We are just=\r\n laying the foundation as per the instruction received\n&gt; by us. We are just=\r\n instruments in a big plan. The reason for the\n&gt; instruction we received ma=\r\ny become clearer after more time.\n&gt; \n&gt; The proof of the pudding is in eatin=\r\ng it. If one tries a procedure\n&gt; given in the manual for a few months, one =\r\nwill know what it does.\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, I have no problem with people doin=\r\ng longer\n&gt; procedures at all. There are many traditions and many\n&gt; procedur=\r\nes. While we are here to spread one particular\n&gt; procedure, we do respect a=\r\nll traditions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_01CF_01C852F0.F27B3A90\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3243&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\nFONT size=3D2&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial&gt;Dear Ramadas ji,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you for your comments and I will give some quick re=\r\nplies.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&gt; But my intention is when we =\r\ndo some traditional Yajnas like \nthis,&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;W=\r\nhat is taught in the manual is *not* a &quot;traditional Yajna&quot;.
