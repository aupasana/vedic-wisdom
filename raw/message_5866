All of them never minced words and had a very clear idea of dharm=\r\na vs ahimsa and other puzzles. Narasimha ji had a beautiful mail sometime a=\r\ngo describing dharma ,it need not be a absence of fighting quality,when don=\r\ne with a sense of purpose driven as an instrument in the hands of the mothe=\r\nr goddess like a shivaji would it is still dharma.Swami Chinmayananda is an=\r\n perfect example to illustrate this. \n\nAnywaz Swami Chinmayananda saw the p=\r\nartition of India at very close quarters and provided much needed critical =\r\nleadership to the masses.Swamiji was also one of the founders of the Vishwa=\r\n Hindu Parishad ( One can view this event through biased lenses but the fac=\r\nt remains the organization did a lot of good and still does ) \n\nAlso their =\r\ncurrent Chinmaya mission does some amazing work both in the east and west.U=\r\nnlike some other so called modern day gurus, swamiji never wastes any words=\r\n spinning melodramatic paragraphs and is precise to the point.\n\nRegards\nVem=\r\nparla Ram Kishore \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Chandra Prakash &lt;v=\r\nedicstudent@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; A very interesting interview!
