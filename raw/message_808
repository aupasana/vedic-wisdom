Well, you cannot. And yo=\r\nu need not!\n\nI didn&#39;t ask that actually :). I just gave the excerpts from t=\r\nhe \nArticle, which is in terms of question & answer. The question was \naske=\r\nd by somebody and the reply was given by some monk from \nRamkrsihna Mission=\r\n.\n\nAnyways, your misunderstanding was also good, which would have \ncleared =\r\nsome more doubts of some on the list :)\n\nYours,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; P=\r\nlease check &quot;Ramakrishna as we saw him&quot; by Swami Chetanananda. \nSeveral peo=\r\nple who knew Ramakishna well reminisced about their \nencounters with him an=\r\nd Swami Chetanananda chronicled those in that \nbook.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Read the chapter=\r\n on Sarada Devi. In that chapter, Sarada Mata \nremembers Ramakrishna. One o=\r\nf the accounts mentions the rebirth \nprediction.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Ramakrishna told Sar=\r\nada Mata pointing at the northwest that he \nwould be back after 100 years. =\r\nSarada Mata told him she would not \ncome back. His niece Lakshmi Devi also =\r\nsaid she definitely did not \nwant to come back. Ramakrishna then laughed an=\r\nd said &quot;how can you \npeople not come back? Our karmas are intertwined. Just=\r\n as the whole \nkalmi plant on the water surface of a pond comes off when yo=\r\nu pull \nONE stem, all of you WILL have to come back when I come back.&quot;\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; Thus, not only did Ramakrishna pedict that he would come back \nafter abou=\r\nt 100 years, but he also predicted that key people around \nhim would be bac=\r\nk. It is possible that Sarada Mata, his sishyas, \nMathur, Ramkumar, Rani Ra=\r\nsmani, Girish etc all will/have come back.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\nUtpal asked how to identify him. Well, you cannot. And you need \nnot!\n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n Take another example. Narasimha, Rama and Krishna are incarnations \nof the=\r\n same being (Vishnu). But each is unique and not replacable by \nanother. Si=\r\nmilarly, Ramakrishna is unique. Those who like him will \nget knowledge and =\r\nspiritual progress through him. The reborn version \nmay again be unique and=\r\n have a new lila - a new play. Those who like \nhim may get knowledge and sp=\r\niritual progress through him.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bottomline is this Utpal: Those who fin=\r\nd Ramakrishna useful need \nnot find his reborn version useful. Also, to tho=\r\nse who find his \nreborn version to be useful, it may not matter that he is =\r\nthe \nrebirth of Ramakrishna. Those who are attached to Lord Narasimha may \n=\r\nnot be attracted to Lord Rama. And, to those who worship Lord Rama, \nit may=\r\n not matter that he is the rebirth of Lord Narasimha.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *     =\r\n   *\n&gt;  \n&gt; There are different classes of beings. While some beings merge i=\r\nn \nBrahman and do not come back, some beings are ever-free and yet \nengage =\r\nin the game from time to time. Gods like Vishnu, Shiva etc \nand rishis are =\r\nfree and yet participate in the game of duality from \ntime to time. Though =\r\nthey are free, they do not merge back in \nBrahman for a long time. Such bei=\r\nngs keep taking birth on earth from \ntime to time. I believe that Ramakrish=\r\nna, Sarada Mata, Vivekananda, \nBrahmananda etc are such beings.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best =\r\nregards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- Dinesh Nambisan &lt;dinesh@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Na=\r\nmaste,\n&gt; &gt; I vaguely recall reading somewhere that Shri Ramakrishna \nParama=\r\nhamsa once stated that he \n&gt; &gt; would be reborn in 100 or 150 years time, ca=\r\nn anyone kindly \nverify whether that statement \n&gt; &gt; is indeed true; and if =\r\nso kindly provide a reference to the text \nthat has that quote? I also \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n recall reading that he mentioned that his disciples would again \ngather wi=\r\nth him this time \n&gt; &gt; around as well; so any references to that would be ap=\r\npreciated \nas well.\n&gt; &gt; Best.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
