Very often a Vibhuti=\r\n may not even be perfect in many aspects of his/her life and work, yet inva=\r\nriable, if we take an objective perspective, we will find that some part of=\r\n a greater scheme has been served by their lives, knowingly or unknowingly.=\r\n\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nOf spiritual Vibhutis, they can be broadly classified in two=\r\n categories.=C2=A0 Vibhutis of the Purusha and Vibhutis of the Shakti.

It promt me=\r\n to write first time on this group.\n=C2=A0\nRegarding the concept of Avatar =\r\nand Vibhuti,=C2=A0do you want to say=C2=A0that Jesus or Nanak or Sai baba o=\r\nr may be Budhha are Vibhutis=C2=A0? \nSeeking the history, there might be or=\r\n may not be very little evidence of Avatars only we rely upon=C2=A0the lite=\r\nrature corresponding to that. I know it is due to the time frame or Yug cha=\r\nnge but if we=C2=A0consider=C2=A0Vibhutis then we have lot of historical ev=\r\nidences beside literature. Don&#39;t we believe that Avatar is a big phenomenon=\r\n and beyond the scope of scriptures? because we have these scriptures trans=\r\nferred by one generation to another and might have some bias associated wit=\r\nh them. I am having little knowledge about this but what i feel is that we =\r\nhave many versions of same SB or even epics like Ramayan or Mahabahrata.\nSo=\r\nmewhere i like the concept of evolutionary Avatars, if we consider our fram=\r\ne of reference as our present Universe this concept fits well. By the way i=\r\nf we look beyond this frame of reference it might be different story. My id=\r\nea is the frame of=C2=A0reference is important in this context.=C2=A0In my =\r\nopinion=C2=A0it may be true that there are other &quot;Worlds&quot; as well which are=\r\n beyond our imagination or scope, Avatars are Phenomenon of this World, our=\r\n frame or reference, our universe. So it seems in a perfect alignment of ev=\r\nolution of our universe.\nConsidering our evolution in present Kaliyug, it m=\r\night be possible that Kalki Avatar will be more like a destroyer, i don&#39;t h=\r\nave words to explain here. I remember a picture at Raghunath temple in Jamm=\r\nu where Kalki avatar is depicted like Surya or some thing similar. I hope i=\r\nf some one can shed more light to this.\nWith my minuscule knowledge on this=\r\n subject=C2=A0i try to add my two cents to this lovely discussion.\n=C2=A0\nR=\r\negards\nAshish Agarwal\n\n\n________________________________\nFrom: rajarshi nan=\r\ndy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com&gt; \nSent: Sunday, May 5, 2013 1:04 PM\nSubject: Re: [vedic-w=\r\nisdom] Re: Comparing Dasavataras!\n\nDear Narasimha,\n=C2=A0\nJai Ma!\n\n\nJust to=\r\n clarify, I may have a special liking for Krshna, but my aim is obvious not=\r\n to demean Rama, or any other special form of God.=C2=A0Just clarifying inc=\r\nase someone gets the wrong impression.

It is only in other puranas, that we get the focus on 10 Avatars, and t=\r\nhe term becomes popular. \n=C2=A0\nAnd ONLY when we take these 9/10 Avataras,=\r\n in a fixed sequence=C2=A0of appearence, that we get the popular concept of=\r\n Dasavatara. Else no. I find the evolutionary link in this concept of 9/10 =\r\nAvataras too compelling to be ignored.=C2=A0=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n&lt;&lt;After all, &quot;ent=\r\nire divinity&quot; cannot be encapsulated by any form&gt;&gt;\n\n\nThis, I am in total ag=\r\nreement with. Infact, in the 10th Chapter of Gita when the Supreme explains=\r\n the various vibhutis, this One is not even Krshna, but has transcended eve=\r\nry limitation of conception. Hence, the One says, among those who weild wea=\r\npons, it is Rama, and among the Vrishnis it is Krshna! Etc..\n=C2=A0\n&lt;&lt;First=\r\n, he IS mentioned in SB list of avataras as well as Parasara&#39;s list. If he =\r\ndoes not &quot;fit&quot; in your &quot;scheme of evolutionary Avatars&quot;, then your concept =\r\nis possibly wrong and avataras are perhaps not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theori=\r\nze.&gt;&gt;\n\nAs I said, the SB list contains 22 Avataras. It does not focus on th=\r\ne idea of 9/10 Avataras! That is my point. If you take 22 Avataras, then th=\r\nese link to grahas are not of any use. For these nine grahas, individually =\r\nor in combination, will represent all Avataras, or for that matter everythi=\r\nng else in this Universe.\n=C2=A0\nSecondly, if we take 10 Avatars and corres=\r\nponding grahas for each, then what must Kalki be? Lagna? But=C2=A0lagna is =\r\nnot a graha.\n=C2=A0\nOr, just surmising, can it be possible that until an Av=\r\natara actually descends on the earth, his energy and his force cannot be at=\r\ntributed to any graha, but once he does appear, it reconfigures things comp=\r\nletely? We can only know after the last Avatara comes.\n=C2=A0\nAnyway, I am =\r\nnot looking at this main Avatars from the point of grahas/jyotish at all. F=\r\nor that matter, some traditions consider Balarama to be an Avatara rather t=\r\nhan Buddha.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nThe concept of Avatara and Vibhutis comes from th=\r\ne Gita. These two are slightly different. Avatara is a special descent of G=\r\nod, Paramatma, which appears on this world=C2=A0during times of severe cris=\r\nis to=C2=A0cause a drastic and fundamental=C2=A0transition.

More importantly, if your understanding is co=\r\nrrect, why isn&#39;t perfection occurring in the FINAL incarnation but occurrin=\r\ng well before?\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nFirst, regarding Krishna bein=\r\ng a &quot;poornavatara&quot;, SrimadBhagavatam (SB) does not say that Rama is not one=\r\n. In fact, Parasara, father of Vyasa, explicitly mentioned that Rama, Krish=\r\nna, Narasimha and Varaha are &quot;poornavataras&quot; (used that exact expression) w=\r\nhile other avataras have some amount of jivatmamsa too (though paramatmamsa=\r\n dominates jivatmamsa).\n=C2=A0\nSecondly, after describing the avataras, SB =\r\nsays that there are in fact innumerable avataras and that all rishis, munis=\r\n, manus, demigods etc are avataras of Supreme Lord. It is under THAT contex=\r\nt that 1.3.28 then proceeds to say &quot;these avataras are partial, while Krish=\r\nna is Lord Himself.&quot; I question if the deduction that Krishna *alone* is Lo=\r\nrd Himself and Rama is not is accurate! It only seems to say that all these=\r\n rishis, manus, demigods etc are partial. As I said above, Pararsara explic=\r\nitly said that both Rama and Krishna are poornavataras.\n=C2=A0\nThird, let u=\r\ns ask a very fundamental question: What exactly does it mean if an avatara =\r\nis &quot;Lord Himself&quot;?\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nWhile SB talks of Krishna =\r\nbeing &quot;Lord Himself&quot; in 1.3.28, it also says in 1.3.30: &quot;forms of Supreme L=\r\nord, who is in reality formless (arUpa) and of the nature of pure conscious=\r\nness (chidAtman), are manufactured by the qualities of Maya&quot;. In the next v=\r\nerse, it further compares forms of Lord to clouds in sky and dirt in air. J=\r\nust as sky *contains* clouds and is beyond them, similarly Lord *contains* =\r\nforms and is beyond them. So, again, what is the meaning of a specific form=\r\n that descended on earth being &quot;Lord Himself&quot;? I am afraid people may be mi=\r\nsinterpreting this notion based on their fancies and conditioning..\n=C2=A0\n=\r\nAll beings are made up of paramatma (supreme/absolute being) and jivatma (l=\r\niving/relative being). The latter portion is dominant in us and is responsi=\r\nble for desires and rebirth. Great avataras descend from a higher portion o=\r\nf paramatma. Very rarely avataras descend entirely from paramatma without A=\r\nNY jivatma portion. Rama and Krishna are specific examples given by Parasar=\r\na.\n=C2=A0\nThey are entirely divine, but they do not encapsulate the entire =\r\ndivinity!!!! After all, &quot;entire divinity&quot; cannot be encapsulated by any for=\r\nm just as no cloud can contain the entire sky. They take part in the drama =\r\nobeying and executing the divine will but NOT altering it. This applies to =\r\nKrishna as well as Rama.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\n&gt; Buddha was great sp=\r\niritual force in this world. But I do not\n&gt; see him fit in the scheme of ev=\r\nolutionary Avatars. His\n&gt; realization, the one he advocated, is a static re=\r\nalization,\n&gt; an end in a void.\n=C2=A0\nFirst, he IS mentioned in SB list of =\r\navataras as well as Parasara&#39;s list. If he does not &quot;fit&quot; in your &quot;scheme o=\r\nf evolutionary Avatars&quot;, then your concept is possibly wrong and avataras a=\r\nre perhaps not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theorize.\n=C2=A0\nSecondly, as per Para=\r\nsara, Buddha corresponds to Mercury, who personifies logical mind and the s=\r\npirit of investigation and comprehension. Logical mind and its spirit of co=\r\nmprehension are inherently fallible. Even a perfected spirit of comprehensi=\r\non is not capable of grasping the Absolute Reality completely, for it is be=\r\nyond comprehension. So, no wonder it simplifies the Incomprehensible in an =\r\nattempt to comprehend! That is what Buddha ended up doing. However, logical=\r\n mind has a great appeal in the Age of Reason in this Kali yuga.

(In any case, it&#39;s a different ma=\r\ntter that you are only taking some SB verses and ignoring some as I showed!=\r\n.)\n=C2=A0\nThe bottomline as far as I am concerned is that Pararsara&#39;s list =\r\nactually makes amazingly coherent esoteric sense. The nature of each aspect=\r\n of consciousness (e.g. Buddha - spirit of comprehension, Saturn - spirit o=\r\nf patience & persistence, Venus - spirit of happiness etc) and the story of=\r\n corresponding avatara DOES have a highly meaningful connection, esoterical=\r\nly speaking. After all, esoterically is how you really need to understand a=\r\nny higher scriptures and notions in them.\n=C2=A0\nIf we take scriptures lite=\r\nrally instead and draw lopsided conclusions, some would conclude that Shiva=\r\n is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and other deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; some would conclude=\r\n that Surya is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and other deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; and so o=\r\nn.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nOn a different note, someone may think th=\r\nat Kali, being Aadyaa, is superior to Tara and like Kali more. But, some le=\r\narned yogis have declared them to be essentially the same and some scriptur=\r\nes even prohibited differentiating between them. As I see it, the differenc=\r\ne between them is too subtle for even rishis to clearly comprehend. People =\r\nseeing some significant difference between them are, I am afraid, merely pr=\r\nojecting their own conditioning. Same in the case of Krishna and Rama.

So =\r\nI am afraid Krishna and Rama are not that different, though the specifics o=\r\nf their stories may be different.\n=C2=A0\nOne last word though. If someone t=\r\nruly believes that Krishna is superior to Rama and worships Krishna (or vic=\r\ne versa!), I am very happy for such a person. My arguments are more for the=\r\n sake of sharing thinking/knowledge and pushing the boundaries of understan=\r\nding in the long run, than changing the minds of anyone in the short run.

Let me write down as I see =\r\nit, in point by point manner.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;1. In the Bhagwata Purana, there are a l=\r\nist of 22 Avataras of Vishnu. In this list of 22, Varaha Avatara is the 2nd=\r\n Avatara, and Matsya is the 10th Avatara. Dattatreya, Nara-narayana,Vyasa D=\r\neva himself are in this list, and then the Bhagawata Purana goes ontu menti=\r\non that the Avatars of Vishnu are innumerable. In the 10th Canto, Vyasa say=\r\ns all these Avatars, and innumerable others, are amsas of the Supreme Being=\r\n while Krshna is &quot;swayam Bhagawan.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;2. Of these various possible Avata=\r\nras, 10, or rather 9 as I believe, are/have been accorded special mention a=\r\nnd significance across various Hindu spiritual literature, specially those =\r\nwhich were composed in the Kali-Yuga, namely the Puranas.[When Krshna was a=\r\nlive, it was Kali-Sandhya, his physical presence had curtailed the full eff=\r\nect of Kali,once he left his body, Kali started in full flow. All Puranas w=\r\nere composed after this, hence these are scriptures of the Kali-Yuga, as ar=\r\ne Tantras]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;3. These 10/9 Avataras have a fixed sequence of appearance.=\r\n Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krshna, (Budd=\r\nha) and Kalki. There is an unmistakeable connection of the form and sequenc=\r\ne of these main avatars with the evolution of life on earth. From the aquat=\r\nic, to the amphibian, to the land-animal, to the half-animal-half-man, to t=\r\nhe dwarf man (first human life form who immediately takes possession of thi=\r\ns earth represented by Vamana&#39;s 3 steps), to the Rajashik avatara of Parash=\r\nurama moving around with an axe, to the Sattwa Guna Avatara of Rama, to the=\r\n Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, this indicates that spirituality is not t=\r\no be separated into another world, but is a progressive realization of the =\r\nvarious manifestation and potentials that lie inherent in the consciousness=\r\n and its development through various life-forms. Larger spirituality of ear=\r\nth and evolution go hand in hand. That is Nature&#39;s grand design for life on=\r\n earth.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;4. In this specifc context, I am only focusing on the parable =\r\nof these main 9/10 Avatars. It is not my contention that if one worships sa=\r\ny Matysa Avatara, one will not attain to a state of liberation of the soul.=\r\n As is the nature of spiritual cosmology in Hinduism, any Devata can lead a=\r\n person to any depth of realization. And each one of the Avatars of Vishnu =\r\nare self-realized in their own way and can be consider super-massive spirit=\r\nual dynamos.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A05. Of these, naturally, Rama and Krshna are most =\r\nadored because they represent a stage of evolution, both inside as well as =\r\noutside, which society can relate of much easier, in this age. Rama represe=\r\nnts, for me, the stage of most satwic mind. A satwic mind is in control of =\r\nitself. It known how to transform the animal tendencies within and without =\r\n- monkeys - into a constructive force for a greater purpose. However, as wi=\r\nth a state of full Sattwa Guna, there can be instances, even though few, of=\r\n dejection. For it is static in nature and will change only when circumstan=\r\nces force it to. As per the Valmiki Ramayana, Rama did feel dejected while =\r\nsearching for Sita in the forest. He did have a moments fear before the fin=\r\nal assault on Ravana, which was dispelled by Agsatha when the later reveale=\r\nd the stotra of the Sun to Rama. At the end of the final battle, Rama tells=\r\n Sita, in a most dispassionate manner, that he killed Ravana not to rescue =\r\nher, but it was\n the Dharma to do so, and to unhold his family honour. That=\r\n too was the dharma of that age when he lived, family honor. The way I look=\r\n at this grand epic, and I bow humbly to the genius of Rishis Valmiki for r=\r\nepresenting the things as they are, as a scribe, as a poet, as an observer,=\r\n and not adding his own preferences to it anywhere, in the 14 years of trib=\r\nulation that Rama faced which culminated into his killing Ravana, he change=\r\nd into the most dispassionate leader, such that no personal consideration o=\r\nr emotions or passions can overturn the Rajadharma. His life is a lesson of=\r\n what a true leader must be! Krshna, OTOH, had this immaculate detachment r=\r\night from birth. I am not taking his=C2=A0 supernatural feats into account.=\r\n It is his singular and constant detachment from situations, from people, f=\r\nrom environment, from circumstances that mark his life. At the age of eight=\r\n, he decides to leave Vrindavana for Mathura. All his friends, his foster p=\r\narents, his\n village-folks who so loved him, pleaded with him that it would=\r\n make no sense for him to leave the shelter, love and comfort of his happy,=\r\n settled village life and head into an unknown destiny and destination. Krs=\r\nhna tried to reason with them, then he understood that they won&#39;t understan=\r\nd, he promised he will return back once his work in Mathura is over. He nev=\r\ner returned. Later, much later, when the Gopis came to him asking him to pa=\r\nrticipate in their dance, he obliged. But the moment some of them started g=\r\netting jealous and possessive of Krshna, he removed himself quietly from th=\r\ne scene, saying that he belongs to everyone equally and no one has any spec=\r\nial right over him. When Shishupala abused Krshna, the later merely kept dr=\r\nopping flowers on the floor, smiling and counting. The moment the 100th abu=\r\nse was over, he swiftly cut off Shishupala&#39;s head and was back into his poi=\r\nse. But when Bhurishrava unfairly accused Krshna of being a revolutionist a=\r\nnd\n charlatan, Krshna did not kill him. When Duryodhana, who used to think =\r\nof Krshna as another black magician, wanted to arrest him, Krshna showed hi=\r\ns vikarala roopa in the assembly of kings, yet he did not finish the enemie=\r\ns off. The very next moment he was back into his own poised self. Never in =\r\nthe whole Mahabharata is there one instance of his going overboard, never a=\r\n single shade of depression, equivocation, or lack of confidence in his act=\r\nions, irrespective of what others say or think of him. And then right in th=\r\ne middle of the greatest war he had the perfect equipoise to deliver the mo=\r\nst sublime spiritual philosophy. That is why his life remains the best idea=\r\nl of Karma-Yoga. For a true Karma-Yogi by definition can never be dejected.=\r\n It is impossible. Neither the action nor the results belong to the instrum=\r\nent. When running away from the battle-field and killing Kaliya Yavana, or =\r\nwhen advising Bheema to tear apart Jarashanda, or gesturing Bheema to\n hit =\r\nDuryodhana below the waist, or getting Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krshna, as=\r\n if by some Divine Intuition, knew exactly how the situations must be lined=\r\n up which would cause the destruction of these people. This kind of knowled=\r\nge cannot come by the rational thinking. But happens when one is constantly=\r\n and consciously connected to the Universal Force. We do not find these kin=\r\nd of complex situations in the Rama Avatara, at least in the Valmiki Ramaya=\r\nna. Of course, if we take the Adhbut Ramayana or such other auxilliary text=\r\ns and retelling, we get a different picture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana we hav=\r\ne a 1000 headed demon attacking Rama after he kills Ravana, and then Sita t=\r\nurns into Adya Shakti and demolishes the 1000 headed demon and Rama worship=\r\ns her. But if we take only the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the picture th=\r\nat emerges is very clear. Rama is the embodiment of Sattwic mind. Therefore=\r\n he displays all the great characteristics of satwa, chief of\n which is sel=\r\nf-control, as well as the occasional sadness caused due to separation from =\r\nhis wife Sita whom, at least until Ravana was destroyed, he loved very dear=\r\nly. Satwa guna creates a true saint, but can also cause some grief when the=\r\n stability is shaken. Krshna was gunatita. He had no attachment to anything=\r\n in this world - man, women, deva, danava, friend, enemy - and therefore he=\r\n was never affected any trace of negative emotion. His Ananda never left hi=\r\nm even in the most trying situations. 6. Buddha was great spiritual force i=\r\nn this world. But I do not see him fit in the scheme of evolutionary Avatar=\r\ns. His realization, the one he advocated, is a static realization, an end i=\r\nn a void. This is clearly denying of the reality of this earth. I find this=\r\n not in tune with what either Rama or Krshna espoused. None of them negated=\r\n this world. If negation of this world and life is the final aim, then why =\r\nsend so many avatars at crucial stages of evolutionary\n development? If the=\r\n spiritual impact on masses is the reason for Buddha being an Avatara, then=\r\n why not Jesus or Zorathrusta.? They are no less impactful in that sense. B=\r\nut do they fit in the scheme of spiritual line that these 9 Avataras of Nar=\r\nayana indicate in a most logical manner? No. As such many vaishnava traditi=\r\nons in parts of India, do not consider Buddha to be an avatara. Realization=\r\n, to be complete and holistic, must be both static and dynamic, outside of =\r\nlife as well as inside of life. That is why the Tantras formed their own ki=\r\nnd of spiritual philosophy, of the world as body of Shakti and therefore an=\r\n object of reverence and realization. 7. The original literature of the Nat=\r\nh Yogis used to mention 9 chakras. These are centers of psychological funct=\r\nions. 6 inside the human body and 3 too subtle, or non-developed in most pe=\r\nople, even seekers. It is my belief that each of the 9 Avataras - excluding=\r\n Buddha - correspond to the full power and force\n of one of these 9 Chakras=\r\n. Similarly, the 9 grahas, or that which can modify consciousness or allow =\r\nthe consciousness to explore and express itself is various possiblities, ar=\r\ne 9 in number. The lagna is a reference point and not a graha. Therefore th=\r\ne chief Avatars who represent the parable of evolution are nine in number. =\r\nAnd the ninth of the sequence is yet to come. 8. I cannot comment on which =\r\ngraha would typically represent which Avatara. I know of what the BPHS says=\r\n, however, it is my belief - feel free to disagree with it -:)[one cannot r=\r\nule out some deep-rooted corruption of understanding or textual misrepresen=\r\ntation in this Kali-Yuga] - that the Atmah among the Avataras has not yet a=\r\nppeared. It will be Kalki, or as Vimalananda seems to say in the Aghora boo=\r\nks, Nishkalanka - the stainless one. There is only one thing which is perfe=\r\nctly stainless, the Atmah .After a Nirguna/Gunatita awastha comes living in=\r\n the full and complete purity and might\n and force and strength of the Atma=\r\nh. By the sheer dint of his purity the last Avatara will burn away opposing=\r\n forces of this world and fulfill the purpose of evolution. Even Krshna use=\r\nd diplomacy at various points in his adult life to achieve his ends. Kalki,=\r\n I am speculating, won&#39;t even need that. The white horse and that sword is =\r\na metaphor. He will be the only one capable enough to rectify the various e=\r\nrrors and corruptions that beset our age. Well, this is how I look at the s=\r\ntory of Avataras. It is perfectly ok not to agree with my views, but I am r=\r\neasonably sanguine now that this is what is closer to truth. -Regards =C2=\r\n=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwa=\r\nmajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;_____________________________=\r\n___\n&gt;From: Narasimha P.V.R.

For example, Rama, Krishna and Narasimha are Sun=\r\n, Moon and Mars, respectively. =C2=A0 We also know that Sun, Moon, Mars, Me=\r\nrcury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are personifications of soul, =\r\nmind, energy/initiative/drive, learning spirit, wisdom/discrimination, spir=\r\nit of enjoyment/being happy, patience/discipline,\n spirit of innovation/bre=\r\naking barriers and detachment (respectively). =C2=A0 Correspondingly, each =\r\navatara is an expression of that aspect of Supreme in a perfected form. Eac=\r\nh story is an example of how that aspect operates. =C2=A0 Lord Rama&#39;s story=\r\n is a perfected example of how soul operates. Lord Krishna&#39;s story is a per=\r\nfected example of how mind operates. Lord Vamana&#39;s story is a perfected exa=\r\nmple of how wisdom/discrimination operates.

Soul in us, mind in us, =\r\nenergy in us, learning spirit in us, wisdom in us, happiness in us, discipl=\r\nine/patience in us - all these are different manifestations of the same Sel=\r\nf. However, when Self manifests as these different aspects, it has differen=\r\nt qualities and plays different roles. There is no comparison between them.=\r\n =C2=A0 We MAY focus on one aspect of us first,\n perfect it and then perfec=\r\nt other aspects through it. But, we need balance between all aspects in the=\r\n end. Similarly, these different aspects of Supreme Being are incomparable =\r\nand are in a balance working together in the Cosmos. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n* =C2=A0 One who is fascinated by the qualities of soul may like the story =\r\nthat demonstrates how soul operates; one who is fascinated by the qualities=\r\n of mind may like the story that demonstrates how mind operates, and one wh=\r\no is fascinated by the qualities of wisdom may like the story that demonstr=\r\nates how wisdom operates. And so on. But this is just a matter of taste and=\r\n subjective preference. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 Let us focus on Rama a=\r\nnd Krishna, i.e. soul and mind. Soul is seen as a representative of god in =\r\nus, because of some basic attributes of it. It is the higher self and has n=\r\no agendas, no likes or dislikes. =C2=A0 Once mind fancies a separate existe=\r\nnce with some\n agendas/desires, soul supports the individualized consciousn=\r\ness stemming from that fancy and sees it as its dharma. It lends strength a=\r\nnd support to EVERY aspect of this individualized consciousness (e.g. mind,=\r\n energy, intellect, learning ability, enjoyment, discipline etc). It suppor=\r\nts them fully and yet has no desires/agendas/likes/dislikes of its own! It =\r\nimpassionately witnesses and records all of one&#39;s agendas and karmas so tha=\r\nt Laws of Nature give proper fruits later on. It does all that despite full=\r\n awareness that it is neither doing those karmas nor receiving the fruits. =\r\nAs mind and other aspects of the individualized consciousness entertain the=\r\n notion that they are doing things and begetting the fruits, soul supports =\r\nthem fully in this play. It sees that as its dharma and does it impassionat=\r\nely. =C2=A0 Now, does this sound exciting? Perhaps not to all. This functio=\r\nnality of an impassionate witness supporting the play, may not seem interes=\r\nting enough\n to some. =C2=A0 On the other hand, mind has likes, dislikes an=\r\nd agendas. It is constantly pursuing those agendas, getting things and achi=\r\neving things. Movement of mind is what keeps the individualization going!!!=\r\n Though soul is the support for everything else in the individualized consc=\r\niousness, soul is a witness doing its dharma impassionately. It is mind tha=\r\nt keeps the individualization going and brings in agendas and passion and e=\r\nven decides/affects every entity&#39;s dharma. That way, mind is really the &quot;bo=\r\nss&quot; of the individualization. No wonder Krishna&#39;s life appeals more to one =\r\nwho may be excited by this description! =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 Lord K=\r\nrishna is obviously awe-inspiring, but let me put Rama&#39;s life in perspectiv=\r\ne. =C2=A0 Rama&#39;s life demonstrates how soul operates. At a young age, he re=\r\nceived Brahma Jnana from Vasishtha and became realized. Yet, he did whateve=\r\nr was his &quot;dharma&quot;. He helped Vishwamitra. Soon after marriage, he was give=\r\nn\n kingdom. At the last moment, his father banished him to forest at the be=\r\nhest of his step-mother and his step-brother was given the throne. He had n=\r\no complaints. Though his father, step-mother and step-brother felt guilty t=\r\no various degrees, he himself supported and consoled all three and followed=\r\n his dharma impassionately. Though he knew leaving Sita in the forest with =\r\nLakshmana and going after the golden deer would cause problems, he did it i=\r\nmpassionately when Sita insisted. When she was kidnapped by Ravana, he sear=\r\nched for her and fought the battle. He never faulted Sita for forcing him t=\r\no leave her or faulted Lakshmana for leaving her later. He accepted every l=\r\nife situation with no complaints and did the best possible action then. Eve=\r\nn as he killed Ravana, he did so without hatred or anger, but as his impass=\r\nionate dharma. Even as Ravana was dying, he went to him and respectfully le=\r\narned some subjects that were going to disappear with Ravana! =C2=A0 Rama\n =\r\nis a perfect example of a liberated man with no desires or agendas who impa=\r\nssionately discharges one&#39;s dharma arising from the momentum of karmas befo=\r\nre liberation. THAT is basically what soul does! =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=\r\n=A0 As another example, let us look at Lord Vaamana. His story is a perfect=\r\n demonstration of how wisdom/discrimination operates. =C2=A0 He was born as=\r\n a learned pygmy. He filled the entire cosmos to rid earth of a charitable =\r\ndemon king with many great qualities. =C2=A0 Wisdom/discrimination makes on=\r\ne humble and unassuming. When one is doing good work but tainted with demon=\r\nic qualities (e.g. pride or attachment), one&#39;s discrimination is not please=\r\nd until that pride is suppressed. When wisdom fills one&#39;s entire consciousn=\r\ness, then demonic qualities are completely suppressed. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n* =C2=A0 Please think about the other avataras.

Infac=\r\nt, in the 10th Chapter of Gita when the Supreme &lt;VAR id=3Dyiv4429411241yui-=\r\nie-cursor&gt;&lt;/VAR&gt;explains the various vibhutis, this One is not even Krshna,=\r\n but has transcended every limitation of conception.

If he does not &quot;fit&quot; in your &quot;scheme of evolutionary A=\r\nvatars&quot;, then your concept is possibly wrong and avataras are perhaps not &quot;=\r\nevolutionary&quot; as you theorize.&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As I said, the SB list contai=\r\nns 22 Avataras. It does not focus on the idea of 9/10 Avataras! That is my =\r\npoint. If you take 22 Avataras, then these link to grahas are not of any us=\r\ne. For these nine grahas, individually or in combination, will represent al=\r\nl Avataras, or for that matter everything else in this Universe.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: transparent; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FA=\r\nMILY: Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0=\r\n); FONT-SIZE: 16px&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLO=\r\nR: transparent; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Courier New, courier, mona=\r\nco, monospace, sans-serif; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-SIZE: 16px&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Second=\r\nly, if we take 10 Avatars and corresponding grahas for each, then what must=\r\n Kalki be?
