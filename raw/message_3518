In geeta, Lord Krishna says he is Gayatri Chandas. In my un=\r\nderstanding, a specfic chandas is a meter in which the mantra/sloka/padyam =\r\n(in telugu) is composed. But if we look at different mantras in gayatri Cha=\r\nndas, each has a different meter. For intance, Savitur Gayatri Mantra has 2=\r\n4=C2=A0syllables, Ganapati Moola Mantra has 28=C2=A0syllables, Brihaspati G=\r\nayatri (Vrishabham Charshaneenam....) has 21 letters.

In my experience chanting the Gayatri mantr=\r\na and firmly establishing it in the Hridaya can lead to knowledge of the At=\r\nman.(Soul)\n\nOnly one who is a knower of the Gayatri is a Brahman,the rest a=\r\nre simply dependant one their credentials at birth and intelligence .Whilst=\r\n they like themselves to be called as brahmanas they are actually in a wors=\r\ne position than anybody else in society.Why should I say this with authorit=\r\ny?Because I know this truth having experienced it.\n\nYes ,as long as they ar=\r\ne willing to follow the caveats of Yama,niyama, which include nonviolence (=\r\nie no meat),purity of the body and mind (Shaucha) and pronounce the mantra =\r\nproperly with the swaras.For manasika japa there is no restriction on the s=\r\nwaras but better results are got if the mantra swaras embedd themselves in =\r\nthe mind.\n\nThe Gayatri should be recited at either the Khanda Sandhya(Early=\r\n morning -an hour before and an hour after sunrise) or /and the Shuddha San=\r\ndhya(an hour before and an hour after sunset) or the Turiya Sandhya(an hour=\r\n before and after midnight). The minimum number is 10 or 28 times but to ha=\r\nve anubhava try this .Starting at an auspicious time ,use a rudraksha mala(=\r\n5 mukhi will do,it must be small beads ideally),a woollen white or red blan=\r\nket to sit upon(Darbhasan is ideal),and facing east in the morning start ja=\r\npa of Gayatri.Finish a mala at least and chant in a way that only you can h=\r\near yourself.Increase this to 2 or 3 malas at both sandhyas.\n\nThe word &quot;Gay=\r\natri&quot; itself explains the meaning of this mantra. It has its origin in the =\r\nSanskrit phrase Gayantam Triyate iti, and refers to that mantra which rescu=\r\nes the chanter from all adverse situations that may lead to spiritual death=\r\n. \n\nGoddess Gayatri is also called &quot;Veda-Mata&quot; or the Mother of the Vedas =\r\n=E2=80=94 Rig, Yajur, Saam and Atharva =E2=80=94 because it is the very bas=\r\nis of the Vedas. It is the basis, the reality behind the experienced and th=\r\ne cognized universe. \n\nThe Gayatri mantra is composed of a metre consisting=\r\n of 24 syllables =E2=80=94 generally arranged in a triplet of eight syllabl=\r\nes each. Therefore, this particular meter (tripadhi) is also known as the G=\r\nayatri Meter or &quot;Gayatri Chhanda.&quot; \n\nThe Mantra\n\nAum\nBhuh Bhuvah Svah(give =\r\na fraction of a second halt here)\nTat Savitur Varenyam(another fraction of =\r\na second halt here)\nBhargo Devasya Dheemahi(another fraction of a second ha=\r\nlt here)\nDhiyo Yo nah Prachodayat\n\n~ The Rig Veda (10:16:3)\n\nTat, says Wood=\r\nroffe, refers to the first cause of all substance, as fire in the circle of=\r\n the sun and is supreme Brahman. Savituh is the source of all living beings=\r\n. Varenyam is the excellent one who receives adoration. Bharga destroys sin=\r\n, Devasya means it is full of light, while Dhimahi refers to knowledge bein=\r\ng golden and always within the sun. Dhiyo means Buddhi, Yo stands for energ=\r\ny (tejas). The mantra is divided into three sections of eight letters and f=\r\nour sections of six letters. A dhyana (meditation) in the same chapter desc=\r\nribes Gayatri as having four faces, which are white, yellow, red and black.=\r\n \n\nYet the tantrik tradition has different views of the Gayatri. For exampl=\r\ne, in the Matrikabhedatantra, there is a couplet which says a person who kn=\r\nows the Brahman (the absolute), is a brahmin. \n\nIn the tantrik tradition, e=\r\nach aspect of devata has her or his own form of the Gayatri and it is often=\r\n pronounced at the four junctions of the day, including midnight. \n\nThe tan=\r\ntra based Gayatri is known as the Ajapa japa.\n\nSooo is the sound created wh=\r\nilst inhalation and Hummm whilst exhalation.This method of chanting the man=\r\ntra whilst the root of the uvula is pressed upon by the tip of the tongue o=\r\nr whilst concentration is made upon either the breath,the Hridaya,the Ajna =\r\nchakra or the Sahasrara brings about dissolution of the sensation of the St=\r\nhula Sharira(physical body) and a tremendous perception that one is the Atm=\r\nan.It destroys the attachments and rids one of the Shad Ripus(the six enemi=\r\nes of man).It gives a clear idea of what ones previous births are ,etc.But =\r\none should be forewarned.The practise of mere physical mudras without the l=\r\nearning of Atman tattwa will only give Siddhis and bind one to the material=\r\n world by increasing karmas.\n\nThis Ajapa is recited by every living being u=\r\nnconsciously 21,600 times a day as she or he breathes. Half are the breaths=\r\n which go through the channel of the Sun and half are breaths which go thro=\r\nugh the channel of the Moon.ie.The Pingala and Ida nadis. It consists of th=\r\ne letters Ha and Sa.\n\nFools like to say that these nadis exist within the p=\r\nhysical structures in the body but they are simply gassing about.The truth =\r\nis that these channels and the Kundalini Shakti exist in the Sookshma shari=\r\nra .These have an association with the Stula sharira and can when concentra=\r\nted upon result in the flow of Prana through the nadis .\n\nRecitation of the=\r\n Gayatri brings about spiritual change from within.It invokes the Supreme e=\r\nnergy Gayatri mata which the Christians call as the Holy spirit and brings =\r\nthe glory of the Atman forth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-504667638-1264089364=:87439\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you Krishnenduji, &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Can you please&nbsp;provide the URL of Manishji&#39;s site?&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I have a few questions on this, which probably Nara=\r\nsimhaji will be able to answer.
