If \nso, Why did he suffer with throat cancer if he was not identifying with \nhis actions? (according to your interpretation of Vasistha&#39;s \ndefinition??)&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n*        *        *\n\nLet me elaborate on my understanding of jeevanmukti. Manish loosely (in \nmy view) said in this exchange that rinas are of body and a jeevanmukta \ncontinues to fulfil those rinas.\n\nBut body is an insentient object. It has no rinas. The rinas are not of \nthe body, but of the mind that identifies with it. It is the \nantahkaranas of mind - ahamkara (I-ness) and chitta \n(memory/conditioning) - that are the source of various rinas, \nparticularly chitta. As mind identifies with a body, it projects its \nrinas on the body and makes the body &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;do&quot; things, in \naccordance with those rinas/conditioning.\n\nIf the conditioning in chitta is completely wiped out and ahamkara \nmerges in Self, then it is mukti. But, if the conditioning in chitta is \ncompletely wiped out and yet ahamkara continues to exist with no \nlimiting notions (it is basically the conditioning in chitta that is \nlimiting), then one becomes jeevanmukta (liberated while living).\n\nUnlike in the case of one who leaves body and gets mukti, a jeevanmukta \ncontinues to have an I-ness (but which is not limited by any notions or \nconditioning). This unconditioned I-ness does project into a body. But \nit does not say &quot;I am this body and hence this body should be kept \nhealthy or strong&quot; (THAT would be conditioning in chitta, which is wiped \nout now!). On the other hand, it does not either say &quot;this body should \nbe ignored and destroyed&quot;. Though conditioning is absent now, body keeps \nexperiencing and doing things based on the *momentum* set in motion \nbefore one became jeevanmukta and engaged in conditioned experiences and \nactions. This is like a fan turning for a while after the electricity \nhas been stopped.\n\nManas, buddhi and indriyas keep working as they did before. If one has \nthroat cancer, indriyas may sense pain. Manas (sensory/motor mind) may \nprocess that input and register pain. Buddhi may analyze various \nobservations and draw various conclusions (e.g. &quot;when I gulp or try to \nswallow food, it hurts even more&quot;, &quot;when I take so and so herbal liquid, \nit feels better&quot; etc). A normal person whose conditioned mind (chitta) \nsays &quot;I should overcome and not have this pain&quot; may think of various \nthings to do and struggle with them. But an unconditioned being has no \nsuch considerations. Though one may feel and express the pain and other \nobjective experiences, one reacts to it differently.\n\n*        *        *\n\nThis is a key point:\n\nManas and buddhi are good at making objective observations and rational \ndeductions, but, by themselves, they do not have ANY agenda. They \nneither like something nor dislike something. THAT comes from the \nconditioning in chitta! The hallmark of a jeevanmukta is that THAT is \nabsent!\n\n*        *        *\n\nWhether Ramakrishna was a jeevanmukta is a moot question. A better way \nto express your question is: Can a jeevanmukta get throat cancer and \nfeel pain? How is it possible if there are no karmas or rinas left?\n\nI have already answered it. But, let me sum it up briefly again. Body, \nvarious body parts, jnanendriyas, karmendiyas, manas and buddhi of a \njeevanmukta continue to operate as before. One&#39;s I-ness is intact and \ndoes project itself onto those. But neither I-ness nor those things \ncarry any rinas or karmas. Chitta - the repository of conditioning and \nrinas - is clean. There are no limiting notions. One&#39;s body, indriyas, \nmanas & buddhi keep experiencing and doing things (good or bad!) based \non the previous momentum set by the play of rnas and karmas while some \nconditioning was left in chitta.\n\nBody, various body parts, indriyas of jnana and karma and manas are all \nportions borrowed from various deities. Ahamkara (I-ness) infuses \nsentience into them by projecting awareness into them. The conditioning \nin chitta is what drives how all these are viewed and used. Instead of \nlooking at a sense organ as a portion of Indra or Mitra, one views it as \n&quot;my so and so sense organ&quot;, due to conditioning in chitta. That is what \ncreates karmas and rinas. When that conditioning is *completely* \novercome, ahamkara can still project awareness into those objects, but \nit sees them for what they are. It does not have false and limiting \nnotions like &quot;this throat is mine and MUST feel nice and not feel \npainful&quot;.\n\n*        *        *\n\nMost people who may claim to be (or think they are) jeevanmuktas are not \nreally jeevanmuktas in today&#39;s world.\n\nIf one wants to understand the state of jeevanmukti, Yoga Vaasishtham is \nthe best book. The entire discourse by Maharshi Vasishtha to Lord Rama \nis a detailed and elaborate definition and characterization of a \njeevanmukta.\n\nThere may be other books that explain better how to do various sadhanas \nto progress spiritually and get closer to being liberated oneday. But, \nwhen it comes elaborating what liberation while living actually is, \nthere is none better than Yoga Vaasishtham. Of course, one can say that \nthis is merely an intellectual exercise as far as *we* are concerned. It \nperhaps is, as none of may ever become a jeevanmukta..\n\nOne word of caution: I write with a very confident tone when I have \nstrong conviction in what I write. That is how I am. But I can \ndefinitely be wrong. So please feel free to ignore me! :-)\n\nHappy Shivaratri (tomorrow night) to all!\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTwitter exchange on jeevanmukta between Manish (twitter handle \n@mmpandit) and Narasimha (twitter handle @homam108):\n\nManish: So, what is a jeevanmukta doing here? Nothing really, fulfilling \nall rnas, wait for rnas to be over.\nNarasimha: If a &quot;jeevanmukta&quot; fails in &quot;fulfilling all rnas&quot;, will he b \nbound again? If no, y r they called rnas? If yes, y call him mukta?\nManish: No, rnas will work out themselves, slowly or fast as may be the \ncase. The rnas are of the body he or she occupies. He is mukta because \nhe experiences, actually sees the rnas to be the body&#39;s only. Rnas apply \nto the body, not to you. You are that &quot;speck of effulgent light&quot;, call \nit what you want, Atma, etc.\nNarasimha: Well, that speck of effulgent light was never bound. So, who \nexactly bcame &quot;mukta&quot;? Did & does he/it have rnas? If these &quot;rnas of \nbody&quot; r somehow not fulfilled after one bcomes jeevanmukta, what happens \nto one? :-)\nManish: You are right. The mind thought, that, it was the body, instead \nof this light. That is the original problem. Which every being is born \nwith. Rnas arise from this identification which creates karma. U r not \nthat, so u r not bound, when the mind realises this. Became &quot;Mukta&quot; is \nalso not quite true, since u r that &quot;Light&quot; frm d beginning\nNarasimha: Then, r the rnas of the &quot;body&quot; as u said r of the mind? When \na mind identifies with light & bcomes mukta, does it hv rnas left?\nManish: Ok, karmas projected into mind, are acted on and may be \nexperienced by body. So, why is a jeevanmukta subject to this? because, \nthat person although aware of the light at all times, and of the causal \nn subtle bodies, has not yet directed d mind to identify as that light \nat all times, key word being &quot;all&quot;. This gives karmas time to work. Next \nstage is 24/7 id with light\nNarasimha: As per my understanding, the person u r defining is not a \njeevanmukta. He may b an elevated being, but not mukta (liberated) yet.\nManish: I derive that definition of this &quot;state&quot; from somebody, no \nproblem in disagreement. 24/7 identification with light, most likely \nbody should not exist, no?\nNarasimha: Id with light forever with body dropping off is just mukti, \nnot jivanmukti! Jivanmukti is where body stays. Is body really different \nfrom light? In fact, is there anything other than light? Jivanmukti is \nseeing the play of objects but seeing all as light. Mukti & rna are \ncontradictory concepts & cant coexist. U rnt &quot;free&quot; till u pay back what \nu owe. And that means u dont owe anybody anything once u r truly free. \nWords like free, liberated & jivanmukta r often misused.\nManish: Will explain a bit in detail sometime.\nNarasimha: OK. :-) But, as far as &quot;explaining&quot; is concerned, Vasishtha \nexplained as clearly & elaborately as any human being can ever hope 2.\nManish: The question to my mind is this: was Ramakrishna a Jeevanmukta? \nIf so, Why did he suffer with throat cancer if he was not identifying \nwith his actions? (according to your interpretation of Vasistha&#39;s \ndefinition??)\nNarasimha: Vasishtha didnt give a single definition. His entire \ndiscourse 2 Rama is a definition of jeevanmukta! Will answer ur RK qn \nlater.\n\n"}}
