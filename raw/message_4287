In the Vedas and Upanishads is written that God is one=\r\n and that only vipras say there are many--why then do all the great realise=\r\nd ones and teachers ask us to pray to different Gods instead of the one Sup=\r\nreme Lord - Nirguna Brahman.  Saguna Brahman is represented by the Trinity =\r\n=3D Brahma, Vishnu and Maheswara.  Lord Brahma is our creator- our father- =\r\nall the Devas, manushyas and Rakshasas being derived from him yet we do not=\r\n Worship our father.  Should not a son be closest to his father? \n\nPlease c=\r\nlarify&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nYours truly,\n\nRajendra\n\n\n"}}
