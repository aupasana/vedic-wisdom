It has more effect in molding life than n=\r\nationalism or a common language.&quot;\n\n- Hilaire Belloc (1870-1953)\n\nThe follow=\r\ning paper will examine the Indian social movement known variously as &quot;Hindu=\r\n&quot; Nationalism, or &quot;Hindutva&quot;[1].\n\nThe overtly political aspects of the ongo=\r\ning Hindu renaissance that has been haphazardly developing for the last app=\r\nroximately 135 years, along with its repeated failure to secure its self-st=\r\nated aim of instantiating Rama-rajya (Dharmic rule) on the political scene,=\r\n are crucial topics that very few Hindu intellectuals have addressed in an =\r\nideologically cogent and politically mature manner.  Some of the few intell=\r\nectual leaders who have, in fact, addressed this issue in a truly systemati=\r\nc and well-formulated ideological way include Dr. David Frawley (Sri Vedach=\r\narya Vamadeva Shastri), Sitaram Goel, Ram Swarup and Dr. Koenraad Elst.  I =\r\nhave also written about this topic very extensively, but have only begun re=\r\nleasing a limited number of my writings on this matter to the general publi=\r\nc starting in early 2011, The Dharma Manifesto being the ideological d=E9no=\r\nuement of these writings.  The following are a few thoughts on the current =\r\nstate of contemporary Dharma politics on the South Asian subcontinent, with=\r\n an emphasis on the specific case of what is often termed &quot;Hindu&quot; Nationali=\r\nsm.\n\nAs we will see, the primary stumbling block that has relegated the gre=\r\nater Hindutva movement to near irrelevancy in the dual realms of both ideol=\r\nogical development and engaged political action has been:\n\n1) Its preponder=\r\nance of reactionary thinking and action, rather than proactive cultivation =\r\nof a more revolutionary outlook and practical strategy to both a.)gain poli=\r\ntical power and to b.) consequently govern the Indian nation-state along pu=\r\nrely Dharmic principles.\n\n2) The lack of the divinely-bestowed spiritual em=\r\npowerment that is necessary for any self-described religious-based movement=\r\n to secure meaningful success.\n\nBy the time the British and other European =\r\npowers began the incremental process of colonial domination in India and th=\r\ne rest of South Asia in 1757, much of the Hindu community in north India sp=\r\necifically had already experienced hundreds of years of genocidal religious=\r\n cleansing at the hands of the Mughals and other Islamic invaders before th=\r\nem. Without doubt, the establishment of European rule over India directly s=\r\naved Hinduism (and, arguably, much of Vedic spiritual culture that served a=\r\ns the ancient basis of the later phenomenon of &quot;Hinduism&quot;) from inexorable =\r\nextinction at the hands of Islam.  If the British had not assumed the admin=\r\nistration of India when they did, Hinduism would most likely not exist toda=\r\ny, and all of present day India would be an Islamic state. All followers of=\r\n Dharma must be eternally grateful to the British for this inadvertent resc=\r\nue of the non-Islamic elements of Indian culture.\n\nDuring the more liberal =\r\natmosphere of the British Raj period (1857-1947), history witnessed the beg=\r\ninning stages of a budding, if often very confused, and ultimately self-abn=\r\negating, Hindu renaissance with the emergence of such neo-Hindu movements a=\r\ns the Arya Samaj, Ramakrishna Mission and Hindu Mahasabha, as well as such =\r\nHindu leaders as Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902), Bhaktivinode Thakura (1838-=\r\n1914), Bal Gangadhar Tilak (1856-1920), Arumuga Navalar (1822-1879), Gedong=\r\n Bagus Oka (1921-2002), Sister Nivedita (1867-1911)[2], Annie Besant (1847-=\r\n1933)[3], and many others. As a result of the rediscovery of their Vedic he=\r\nritage on the part of many 19th century and early 20th century Hindu intell=\r\nectual leaders, a new sense of political activism in the name of a rediscov=\r\nered &quot;Hinduism&quot; cautiously developed with the nascent political theories of=\r\n such people as Vinayak Damodar Savarkar (1883-1966) and Keshav Baliram Hed=\r\ngewar (1889-1940).\n\nThe culmination of this new movement, which was decided=\r\nly devoted to a Hindu identity politics, has resulted in the overwhelmingly=\r\n dominant role of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (founded in 1925) and its=\r\n greater Sangh Pariwar family of front organizations over the realm of Hind=\r\nu politics in India for the last 85 years.  The overtly political manifesta=\r\ntion of the Sangh Pariwar movement was eventually manifest in the later Jan=\r\na Sangh political party.  The party operated under this name from 1951-1980=\r\n.  It was founded by Dr. Shyama Prasad Mookerjee (1901-1953), who was subse=\r\nquently murdered by the Congress Party regime in 1953. Since 1980, the part=\r\ny has been known by the name Bharatiya Janata Party.[4]\n\nThere has been a c=\r\nlear, multi-stage trajectory in which pro-Hindu political ideology and acti=\r\nvism have progressed in the last 135 or so years.  Before I discuss the nat=\r\nure of that trajectory in any significant depth, first I need to lay out th=\r\ne three general morphologies that most political formulations have historic=\r\nally taken.  There are three general forms of political activity observable=\r\n in the modern political realm: 1) Utopian, 2) Reactionary, 3) Revolutionar=\r\ny.\n\nUtopian designates a primarily futuristic-oriented politics that tends =\r\nto be very unrealistic and fantasy-fueled.  In many cases utopian-based ide=\r\nologies tend to be eschatologically-driven and millennial in outlook, with =\r\nthe never-achieved (or achievable) promise of a perfect paradise on earth t=\r\nhat can only be delivered by the particular political movement making the g=\r\niven promise. Such disastrously failed movements as Marxism, Leninism, Maoi=\r\nsm, Anarchism and the political Left in general are Utopian in nature.\n\nRea=\r\nctionary, on the contrary, is primarily past-oriented[5] and looks toward a=\r\n &quot;better, more ordered time&quot;, that is historically usually no more than sev=\r\neral generations previous to the present era, as the archetypal hallmark an=\r\nd model for present-day cultural renewal.  As Nicol=E1s G=F3mez D=E1vila  e=\r\nxplains the mindset of the reactionary: &quot;The reactionary is, nevertheless, =\r\nthe fool who takes up the vanity of condemning history and the immorality o=\r\nf resigning himself to it.&quot; American reactionaries, for example, tend to se=\r\ne the 1950s as the apex of American civilization. As is clear from the term=\r\n itself, reactionaries are capable only of reacting to assaults on traditio=\r\nn that they detect around them, and are usually incapable of proffering pro=\r\n-active and positive ideas for how to foundationally transform society for =\r\nthe better in the face of modernity&#39;s degenerate encroachment upon traditio=\r\nnal values and culture. Reactionaries are especially known for timidity, in=\r\ntellectual incuriosity, lack of vision, as well as narrow parochialism and =\r\nimmaturely expressed xenophobia.  Republicans, Tories, and the conservative=\r\n Right in general fall under this general heading. Utopian and Reactionary =\r\nrepresent the two furthest opposing extremes of the political spectrum.\n\nRe=\r\nvolutionary, on the other hand, describes a political stance that is proact=\r\nive and constructive in nature, rather than merely utopian or reactionary. =\r\n Rather than supporting either unrealistic utopian goals, or merely reactin=\r\ng in an ineffectively knee-jerk fashion to the incessant attacks of its opp=\r\nonents,  the revolutionary perspective proffers positive systemic change de=\r\nsigned to transform the basic characteristics of a presently-given social r=\r\neality in a wholly original and fundamental way.  Revolutionaries seek to a=\r\nlter society, not merely peripherally and incrementally, but foundationally=\r\n and swiftly.\n\nIn the very specifically Hindu/Vedic context, the revolution=\r\nary perspective looks at the ancient past (and not merely two or three gene=\r\nrations back, but millennia back) as the source from which to derive eterna=\r\nl principles that are designed to be used in the present day to create a ra=\r\ndically better future. The Dharmic revolutionary subscribes to an archeofut=\r\nurism, to use Guillaume Faye&#39;s instructive terminology.[6] Rather than mere=\r\nly dreaming about an unobtainable future based upon blind faith and wishful=\r\n thinking, or conversely, merely reacting in a frustrated manner to the neg=\r\native occurrences happening around them, revolutionaries seek systemic (and=\r\n not merely cosmetic) change in the here and now.\n\nThe term &quot;Revolutionary&quot;=\r\n tends to carry with it the stereotyped, and wholly inaccurate, notion of p=\r\nolitical violence, which is not at all the technical denotation of this wor=\r\nd in political science terminology.  Rather, by &quot;Revolutionary&quot; is meant a =\r\nconcept, ideology or movement whose aim is to affect fundamental systemic c=\r\nhanges (i.e., a change of the prevailing system itself), rather than merely=\r\n cosmetic or surface change alone (i.e., minutial changes and readjustments=\r\n within the confines of the system).  With this proper understanding of the=\r\n terminology, the term &quot;Revolutionary&quot; does not in any way denote violence.=\r\n\n\nIn brief, a Revolutionary movement must have the following features:\n\nA) =\r\nIt is predicated upon a grand, but rationally achievable, vision.\n\nB) It is=\r\n led by a professional vanguard of elite leaders dedicated to achieving the=\r\n vision, (b.i) who are capable of intellectually formulating that vision in=\r\nto ideological form, (b.ii) who know how to organized the masses in both th=\r\ne largest and most effective ways necessary to achieve the vision, and (b.i=\r\nii) who themselves wholly personify the vision of the movement in their own=\r\n personal character and lifestyle; i.e., the leader is the movement.\n\nC) It=\r\n has a clearly and systematically formulated ideology that encompasses the =\r\ntotality of political concern, including a comprehensive and defensible int=\r\nernal ideological structure, the minutia of economics, a philosophy of gove=\r\nrnance, social relations, geopolitical formulations, etc.\n\nD) It has the ab=\r\nility to both formulate constructive alliances with like-motivated movement=\r\ns/organizations, and has a keen understanding of all aspects of the opposin=\r\ng forces.\n\nE) Most importantly of all: a revolutionary has the resolute wil=\r\nl to win.\n\nAs we look at the last 135 or so years of modern Hinduism, we se=\r\ne that Hindu forms of political expression have progressed roughly and sequ=\r\nentially, though certainly with significant overlaps, through the above thr=\r\nee stages of Utopian, Reactionary, and Revolutionary.\n\n&quot;We Are One&quot; =96 Uto=\r\npian Stage (1875-1925)\n\nBeginning in the Colonial era, and continuing down =\r\nto today, such historical trends as the 19th century neo-Hindu movements an=\r\nd Radical Universalism, as well as such historic figures as Swami Vivekanan=\r\nda, Gandhi, and many of the earlier gurus who came to the West, clearly rep=\r\nresented an early Utopian stage of Hindu political expression.  The concern=\r\ns of such Hindu Utopians included such unrealistic liberal Western notions =\r\nas radical egalitarianism, universalism, evolutionary and historico-progres=\r\nsive world-views, temporal-centrism,[7] and such emotionally-driven eschato=\r\nlogical visions as the future establishment of a pan-ecumenical world polit=\r\nical order =96 what today would be more accurately termed the New World Ord=\r\ner.  Such intellectually puerile sentiments, however, did not (and could no=\r\nt) lead to the type of strong Vedic restoration movement necessary to reviv=\r\ne Dharma globally.\n\nSuch a Vedic restoration is necessarily radically tradi=\r\ntionalist in nature, and is thoroughly opposed to all the key corrosive ele=\r\nments that have rendered modernity non-viable. The German intellectual Edga=\r\nr Julius Jung (1894-1934) presciently describes a similar vision of such a =\r\nrestoration in the following way.\n\n&quot;Restoration of all those elementary law=\r\ns and values without which man loses his ties with nature and God and witho=\r\nut which he is incapable of building up a true order. In the place of equal=\r\nity there will be inherent standards, in the place of social consciousness =\r\na just integration into the hierarchical society, in the place of mechanica=\r\nl election an organic elite, in the place of bureaucratic leveling the inne=\r\nr responsibility of genuine self-government, in the place of mass prosperit=\r\ny the rights of a proud people.&quot;[8]\n\nFor Sanatana Dharma to both survive an=\r\nd thrive in the coming decades and centuries, a thorough Vedic Restoration =\r\nalong the lines of Jung&#39;s words above must be brought about =96 a reaffirma=\r\ntion of Sanatana Dharma&#39;s most ancient and orthodox cultural and spiritual =\r\nexpression in direct contradistinction to the values of both Western materi=\r\nalist modernity and shortsighted Indian nationalism (i.e., &quot;Hindu&quot; National=\r\nism).\n\nMost of the formulators and present-day thinkers of the &quot;Hindu Natio=\r\nnalist&quot; movement represent, to one degree or another, a rather sharp histor=\r\nical and conceptual disconnect from the traditional Sanatana Dharma that ha=\r\nd been taught by the Vedic Acharyas and that had been practiced by the comm=\r\non Hindu people for thousands of years.  After 1000 years of genocidal batt=\r\nering on the part of Islamic invaders, modern Hinduism was definitely not a=\r\nt the height of its intellectual, cultural, spiritual and political/militar=\r\ny glory by the time the British arrived on the scene.  By the time the Brit=\r\nish had saved Vedic culture from extinction, a radically traditional Sanata=\r\nna Dharma, in its unapologetic, pristine, and consciously Vedic-centric for=\r\nm, needed desperately to be reconstructed by her intellectuals and spiritua=\r\nl leaders. Unfortunately, a serious process of tradition-oriented reconstru=\r\nction was not seriously attempted at that time.\n\nInstead of seeing the dire=\r\n problems with Hinduism that were present by the 18th and 19th centuries as=\r\n something that needed to be addressed and cured from within the confines o=\r\nf Sanatana Dharma, the neo-Hindus instead turned to external, non-Vedic, so=\r\nurces for their guiding inspiration. As a result, rather than attempting a =\r\ntrue reconstruction of authentic Sanatana Dharma, which would have made San=\r\natana Dharma strong and pure once again, they instead attempted an unnecess=\r\nary &quot;reform&quot; of Sanatana Dharma along the lines of Christian norms and idea=\r\nls.\n\nThus we saw the Christian-inspired, neo-Hindu obsessions with eliminat=\r\ning &quot;caste&quot;, eliminating sati, eliminating murti worship, Christian style m=\r\nonotheism, &quot;social reform&quot; at the expense of intellectual/spiritual develop=\r\nment, Hegelian historicism, and Radical Universalism. Attendant upon these =\r\nsuperfluous &quot;reforms&quot;, we now witness the sad legacy of a Hindu world confu=\r\nsed about what it believes, about what even constitutes a &quot;Hindu&quot;, about it=\r\ns future, as well as Hindu children who are not interested in Hinduism, and=\r\n a Hindu community of almost one billion people many of whom suffer from in=\r\nferiority complexes and the psychological scars of a people disconnected fr=\r\nom their true spiritual heritage.  What Sanatana Dharma really needed was n=\r\never &quot;reform&quot; along these neo-Hindu lines, but rather a positive tradition-=\r\nbased reconstruction of its eternal ideals. &quot;Hinduism&quot; needed to re-embrace=\r\n its true essence as Sanatana Dharma =96 the Eternal Natural Way.\n\nWhat San=\r\natana Dharma needed =96 and still needs! =96 were two interdependent develo=\r\npments.\n\nA) A reclamation of Vedic-based, traditional Sanatana Dharma, with=\r\n a highly orthodox, Vedic-centric understanding of the unitive and integral=\r\n Vedic culture that had sustained Sanatana Dharma for 5000 years. It needed=\r\n a purely Vedic understanding of pramana (valid means of knowledge and deri=\r\nvation of authority), of the nature of Dharma (in the strictest of philosop=\r\nhical senses, not just the popular sense), of what constitutes Vaidika (Ved=\r\nic) vs. Avaidika (non-Vedic), etc.\n\nB) Once the pure Tradition of Sanatana =\r\nDharma was reconstructed, the next organic development needed to be a stric=\r\ntly Vedic-based strategy for both juxtaposing, but also actively interfacin=\r\ng, traditional Sanatana Dharma with the modern world.\n\nThe latter project o=\r\nf fostering dialogue between Sanatana Dharma and modernity needed to be don=\r\ne, not by falsely denying the differences between the two (as almost all of=\r\n the 19th century proto-Hindutva figures attempted via Radical Universalism=\r\n), but in the same manner that every other ancient culture had met the chal=\r\nlenge of modernity: recognition of most modern religions/ideologies as purv=\r\na-pakshas =96 opposing ideological constructs; friendly and open debate wit=\r\nh these purva-pakshas; unapologetic assurance in the exceptional status of =\r\nSanatana Dharma, and a concomitant refusal to concede to the forced imposit=\r\nion of an inferior status.\n\nUnfortunately, because the unneeded distraction=\r\n of &quot;Hindu reform&quot; became the more easily accomplished dominant paradigm of=\r\n the hour, to this very day the real project of Vedic reconstruction outlin=\r\ned above has barely gotten off the ground.  It is now time to begin the pro=\r\ncess.\n\nMany of the &quot;Hindu reformers&quot; were well-motivated and sincere person=\r\ns who truly felt that they were acting in the interests of Sanatana Dharma.=\r\n Many of Ramakrishna&#39;s words are very inspiring and wise. Swami Vivekananda=\r\n was a truly courageous and talented leader who the Hindu people can and sh=\r\nould take immense pride in. More, many of these personalities did accomplis=\r\nh some good in providing at least some modicum of a vehicle for interfacing=\r\n Sanatana Dharma and modernity, however self-destructive this particular ve=\r\nhicle has ending up being in the long-run.  In formulating a Christian-insp=\r\nired paradigm for Vedic survival with only short-term successes in mind, ho=\r\nwever, they did not have the long-term implications of their syncretism in =\r\nmind.\n\n&quot;We Are Different&quot; =96 Reactionary Stage (1925-1945)\n\nBeginning roug=\r\nhly in the Interwar period (the 1920s and 1930s), we then see the formulati=\r\non of a strictly Reactionary form of Hindu politics with the emergence of S=\r\navarkar, Savitri Devi (the European Pagan writer Maximiani Portas, 1905-198=\r\n2),[9] the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, etc. The uniformed paramilitary for=\r\nmations, martial aesthetic, stress on character development, egalitarian et=\r\nhos combined with a rigid hierarchical structure, and much of the generic p=\r\natriotic rhetoric of the RSS was directly appropriated from the newly immer=\r\nging, parallel nationalist movements that were sweeping the European contin=\r\nent during the 1920s.\n\nUnlike their much more successful European counterpa=\r\nrts, however, this new reactionary Hindu movement had very few innovative i=\r\ndeas, did not know how to successfully engage in politics either electorall=\r\ny (not till the 1980s at the earliest) or in terms of mass mobilization (ot=\r\nher than borrowing heavily from the paramilitary structure earlier develope=\r\nd by their much more successful counterparts in the various nationalist org=\r\nanizations of contemporary Europe), were wholly disconnected from the tradi=\r\ntionalist and orthodox Vedic understanding and practice of the Yoga traditi=\r\non, had no clear understanding of Dharmic political theory, and most import=\r\nantly, did not know how to construct an elite political vanguard capable of=\r\n leading the people by their own spiritual example.\n\nThe RSS and Sangh Pari=\r\nwar defined itself, both historically and to this very day, exclusively in =\r\nnegative juxtaposition to what they were not: they were not Muslims; they w=\r\nere not Christians; they were not Marxists; thus, if only by necessary defa=\r\nult, they were &quot;Hindus&quot;.  However, to this very day, the RSS has found itse=\r\nlf incapable of defining in positive identitarian terms what it actually me=\r\nans to be a Hindu in the spiritual sense of this term. Savarkar&#39;s blind imi=\r\ntation of then-fashionable European racialist theory in the formulation of =\r\nhis interpretation of &quot;Hindutva&quot;, or &quot;Hinduness&quot;, as designating a specific=\r\nally racial group was doomed to failure from the outset. For Savarkar and a=\r\nll those who followed in his footsteps, being Hindu meant being Indian; bei=\r\nng Indian meant being Hindu. Thus, Hinduism for the Hindu Nationalists was =\r\nmerely another term for the Indian race![10] Being a politician, and not a =\r\nVedic philosopher, Savarkar did not understand that Sanatana Dharma does no=\r\nt equate to the Indian race. Sanatana Dharma is a world-view and spiritual =\r\ntradition. It is the sacred heritage, not merely of those people who happen=\r\n to possess an Indian passport, but of the entirety of the Indo-European pe=\r\noples.\n\nTo this day, rather than facilitating the radical, systemic change =\r\nnecessary to bring about a new Dharma civilization (which is clearly not at=\r\n all the aim of these Hindutva movements, and never has been), the Reaction=\r\nary tendency in pro-Hindu politics has shown itself to be an un-visionary, =\r\nanti-intellectual, philosophically impotent and currently irrelevant politi=\r\ncal force. It finds itself dedicated more to a rather light version of Indi=\r\nan Nationalist conservatism than Vedic nation building.\n\nThe deepest extent=\r\n of their political program essentially consists of a return to an era more=\r\n within the comfort zone of the octogenarian men who lead this reactionary =\r\nmovement =96 possibly a return to India circa 1855 for Savarkar and Hedgewa=\r\nr, or an India circa 1955 for an Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advan=\r\ni. A Dharma Nation will never be achieved by the feckless Reactionaries, if=\r\n only because such a goal is not even within the scope of their actual aims=\r\n or intellectual understanding.\n\nSadly, the vast bulk of so-called &quot;Hindu a=\r\nctivism&quot; that takes place today still falls under the category of Reactiona=\r\nry, and is more a reflection of amorphous Indian Nationalism, and general p=\r\nride of place and ethnicity than any serious attempt to reorder society (ei=\r\nther Indian, American, or global) in such a manner as to reflect Dharmic pr=\r\ninciples instantiated in concrete political form.\n\nMany of the attempts at =\r\npolemical and ideological writing that we have seen arising from &quot;Hindu Nat=\r\nionalists&quot; make it all too apparent that they are not yet politically matur=\r\ne enough to either vie for power or to govern a working nation-state. When,=\r\n and only when, it comes to the point that self-described &quot;Hindu Nationalis=\r\nts&quot; develop the philosophical maturity to engage in the nuanced ideological=\r\n struggle necessary to win power, and only when they learn how to develop t=\r\nemporary and practical alliances with others while also keeping the greater=\r\n goal of political power in mind, will they be ready to govern the current =\r\nnation-state of India. Only then will &quot;India&quot; become Vedic Bharat once agai=\r\nn! Contemporary &quot;Hindu Nationalism&quot; needs to move away from the fantasy-rhe=\r\ntoric level that they have wallowed in for so many decades, and begin the h=\r\nard work of engaging in real politics in the real world.\n\n&quot;We are Vedic!&quot; =\r\n=96 Transforming the RSS into a Revolutionary Movement\n\nWithout doubt, the =\r\ncurrent attempt at Vedic restoration is seen as almost being synonymous wit=\r\nh the vision, leadership, organizational structures and ideological pronoun=\r\ncements of the RSS movement.  With approximately six million dedicated acti=\r\nvists, the RSS is officially the largest volunteer organization on the Eart=\r\nh today. Unfortunately, the RSS has served as a sadly flawed and ideologica=\r\nlly challenged vehicle for Vedic restoration.  The RSS will need to address=\r\n the following problems if it is going to transform itself from a Reactiona=\r\nry movement to a Revolutionary one:\n\nA) Distinguishing between Indian Natio=\r\nnalism versus Vedic Restorationism.  Many difficulties arise when these two=\r\n separate concerns become indistinguishable, as they very clearly have in t=\r\nhe minds of almost all &quot;Hindu Nationalists&quot;.  Indian Nationalism is an ethn=\r\nicity/national/racial movement.  Vedic Restoration, on the other hand, is a=\r\n religious/cultural/philosophical one.  The RSS has, in my opinion, been mo=\r\nre of an Indian Nationalist movement than a Vedic Restorationist movement. =\r\nMore, this is the primary reason why the BJP so badly lost the Indian natio=\r\nnal election of 2004 =96 because they tried to appeal to Muslims, Christian=\r\ns, pseudo-secularists, and other non-Hindu Indians merely as patriotic Indi=\r\nans, rather than appealing exclusively to the majority community as followe=\r\nr of Sanatana Dharma[11].  The RSS&#39;s main concern has become Indian Nationa=\r\nlism rather than Sanatana Dharma=85and this has only set the movement back.=\r\n\n\nB) Within the current day Vedic Restorationist movement, we must clarify =\r\nthe difference between Hindu Revival (a political/social/cultural phenomeno=\r\nn), which the RSS is predominantly engaged in, versus Vedic Reconstruction,=\r\n (an intellectual/academic/philosophical/spiritual matrix of projects), whi=\r\nch is precisely what such individuals as David Frawley, Swami Dayananda Sar=\r\nasvati, Shrikant Talageri, Subhash Kak and myself, as well as other, more t=\r\nraditionalist, Vedic thinkers are engaged in. Both are projects of seemingl=\r\ny rival significance, and the different natures, goals and methods of these=\r\n two separate projects need to be understood.\n\nC) Within the parallel proje=\r\ncts of Hindu Revival and Vedic Reconstruction, we need to distinguish betwe=\r\nen a Neo-Hindu versus a Traditionalist world-view, which has been addressed=\r\n to a much greater extent in the book Radical Universalism: Are All Religio=\r\nns the Same?, by Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya.\n\nThe RSS is currently a neo=\r\n-Hindu, revivalist, Indian Nationalist movement. What it needs to become is=\r\n a Traditionalist Vedic Reconstructionist movement. Like some of the 19th c=\r\nentury neo-Hindus of the past, the RSS has done much good for the Indian na=\r\ntion-state historically. The RSS has been on the front-lines of defending H=\r\nindu India from foreign aggression, both military and missionary.[12] The s=\r\nacrifices of countless individual RSS members are too numerous to mention. =\r\n Today, however, both India and Sanatana Dharma need radically more. The RS=\r\nS needs to change quite radically if it is going to maintain itself as an e=\r\nffective organization in the future.\n\nThe following is a ten point program =\r\nthat Hindu Nationalists should implement if they truly wish to transform th=\r\neir nation of India for the better.\n\n1) Annihilate the immediate existentia=\r\nl threat from the Communist terrorists, Islamic Jihadists and Christian mis=\r\nsionaries who have enslaved your country.\n\n2) Stop graduating countless eng=\r\nineers, &quot;IT professionals&quot; and medical personnel, and instead begin to once=\r\n again encourage your children to become philosophers, sadhus (sages), arti=\r\nsts, thinkers, warriors and leaders.\n\n3) Revive the Kshatriya warrior spiri=\r\nt of your ancestors and no longer revel in weakness in the name of ahimsa.\n=\r\n\n4) Re-Aryanize, re-Vedicize and re-spiritualize the entirety of your prese=\r\nnt-day culture.\n\n5) Eliminate the Dalit problem once and for all by allowin=\r\ng those many individuals who are eligible among this community to enter the=\r\n varna system in accordance with their inherent individual psycho-physical =\r\nnature. If a Dalit behaves like a brahmana, then he is a brahmana. Period!\n=\r\n\n6) Learn to interact with modernity in a successful manner. That means, wi=\r\nthout excuses, rededicating yourselves to excellence and perfection in ever=\r\nything you do and communicate.\n\n7) Build your own economy instead of depend=\r\ning upon the West for economic success via immigration and outsourcing of j=\r\nobs. To do this, you will need to completely exorcise your economy of even =\r\nthe slightest taint of socialism and collectivism. Once and for all =96 Soc=\r\nialism simply does not work!\n\n8) Start to carry yourselves with courage and=\r\n pride in your Vedic heritage, rather than viewing this heritage as an emba=\r\nrrassing burden from the past. If you do not reclaim your immense Vedic her=\r\nitage, someone else will reclaim it from you.\n\n9) Make spoken Sanskrit the =\r\nsole recognized language of your nation.\n\n10) To successfully achieve all o=\r\nf the above, stop reaching for any and all excuses for why you have not yet=\r\n been able to achieve these goals. Victory belongs only to those who reject=\r\n excuses. Then, and only then, will Bharat regain the respect of the world.=\r\n\n\nDharma Nationalism: A New Revolutionary Approach\n\nThe new stage that Hind=\r\nu activism needs to take is undoubtedly the Revolutionary approach. It is c=\r\nlear that Indian Hindus now need to enter the Post-RSS phase of Hindu activ=\r\nism. As a starting point, 21st century Hindu activism needs to make a sharp=\r\n break from its more paranoid and pessimistic past, and begin to start thin=\r\nking in much more realistic, concrete, strategic and winning terms.\n\nThe en=\r\nemies of Dharma have had the gift of being able to think and strategize on =\r\na long-term basis. Their end goal has always been the end of Dharmic civili=\r\nzation and the creation of their own dystopic vision of reality ranging cen=\r\nturies into the future! Contemporary Hindu activism, on the other hand, has=\r\n only seemed able to operate reactively, only thinking about some immediate=\r\n injustices that have just occurred in the news today =96 and even then onl=\r\ny rarely reacting effectively, if at all. The contemporary Indian Hindu act=\r\nivist movement needs to stop looking for excuses, and beat the enemy at the=\r\nir own game.\n\nA truly Revolutionary Dharma activist movement has not existe=\r\nd on the world scene until 2012.  The seeds of its birth have now come to f=\r\nruition in the form of the Dharma Nationalist movement.\n\nIndeed, the Indian=\r\n nationalist fueled &quot;Hindu&quot; activism of the past will now quickly take a ba=\r\nck seat to the spiritually fueled Dharma Nationalist activism of the future=\r\n. Unlike parochial &quot;Hindu Nationalism&quot;, Dharma Nationalist activism is, ind=\r\need, comprehensively total in its application. It is based primarily upon s=\r\npiritual/philosophical concern, and only secondarily on ethnic/national con=\r\ncern. It is motivated by the spiritual insight and compassion gifted to us =\r\nby the eternal Truth of Sanatana Dharma, and not merely on an empty pride r=\r\nesiding in the relative and temporal, ever-changing geographical boundaries=\r\n of the nation-state of India. It fosters a true selfless action akin with =\r\nthat of the rishis, and not merely a series of political calculations based=\r\n upon the personal need for power and aggrandizement.\n\nMore crucial than an=\r\ny other juxtaposing comparison to the failed Hindu activist endeavors of th=\r\ne past: Dharma Nationalism presents a clear, realistic, and achievable stra=\r\ntegic diagram revealing exactly how society should be best structured in or=\r\nder to ensure the maximal amount of happiness and prosperity, to the fulles=\r\nt degree of qualitative and spiritual depth, for the greatest number of liv=\r\ning beings.
