I have been doing the Ganapathi Homam for the past=\r\n half a year or so and I should say that I am not maintaining the Brahmacha=\r\nrya as &quot;defined&quot; in the mail exchanges and some books. I feel that the prob=\r\nlem with Sex with most of us is that we tend to identify it with something =\r\nwrong or something which is &quot;impure&quot; and hence forbidden. I have been perfo=\r\nrming some experiments in my daily life and I have found that it is definti=\r\ntely possible to avoid the feelings of Lust, Greed and other feelings even =\r\nwhile having sex. Although I am not perfect in this but I feel with lot of =\r\npractice it should be possible to achieve a state of mind even during sex w=\r\nhere you are focussed on God and not wavered by the feelings that accompani=\r\nes mundane sex. In this case even something as materialistic as Sex will be=\r\n transformed into a intense spiritual sadhana. If you start thinking of Sex=\r\n not as sometihng Impure and start doing it as Karma itself with out any ot=\r\nher accompanying thoughts and do the &quot;Act&quot; itself as an offering to God the=\r\nn I feel that Brahmacharya as defined conventionally is not needed. I would=\r\n say that we are very much observing Brahmacharya. Now coming to Ojas I dou=\r\nbt that Ojas can be so physical as Semen. If the act of Sex is itself perfo=\r\nmed as an offering to God and without any thoughts other than that of God t=\r\nhen where is the question of loosing any spiritual energy . In fact you are=\r\n adding to your spiritual growth. \nI have observed a change in myself after=\r\n doing this practically over the past couple of months. I have found that g=\r\nradually over a period of time even though its possible to completely absta=\r\nin from physical sex, it is also possible to avoid getting swayed by it and=\r\n also not crave for it.\n \n\nContinuing further , how would one justify &quot;Nigh=\r\ntfalls&quot; which is a natural phenomenon wherein the body automatically purges=\r\n excess semen collected over a period of time when one is asleep without th=\r\ne persons control.In other words it is an involuntary action just like brea=\r\nthing.\n\n \nCan this also be intrepreted as break in Brahmacharya? I would be=\r\n keen to know the experiences of those persons who have abstained from phys=\r\nical sex for an extended period of time and what they think of &quot;Nightfalls&quot;=\r\n .\n \n************ ********* ********* ********* ********* ********* *******=\r\n** ********* ********* ********* ********* ********* ********* ********\n \nI=\r\n think that every action that we do should be done with the thought of an o=\r\nffering to god. For example even while having food , we can think each bite=\r\n as an offering to Ganapathi in fire (actually there is a fire in our stoma=\r\nch which burns the food) , Our entire body can be visuilased like a living =\r\nmoving Homa kundam where we continuously offer ahuti of differnet materials=\r\n. If we conciously make this effort over a period of time we would think le=\r\nss about the process of eating food itself , the accompanying pleasure of t=\r\naste etc and concentrate more on mental homam which we are performing. Ever=\r\ny thought process can be considered as an ahuti inside the mental fire in o=\r\nur soul.Like this every action that we do in our daily life can be thought =\r\nas a homam itself and thereby achieve the state of mind where there is no d=\r\nistinction between the so called &quot;Pure&quot; and &quot;Impure&quot; , &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;Bad&quot; and=\r\n so on.\n \nPlease let us know your thoughts on this. If possible try to get =\r\nManishji&#39;s opinion on this as well.\n \nThanks and Regards,\nGirish Sundaram\n\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
