One of the best ghats I found was the next to manikarnik ghat. I do=\r\nnt recall the name right now, but if you walk from Dashashmedh towards Mani=\r\nkarnik ghat, there is a ghat which is a little isolated. There are some str=\r\nuctes made of cement which jut out inside the the Ganges from the ghat. Dur=\r\nibng evening, after 6. its generally less populated area. So you can actual=\r\nly go and sit on the banks of this ghat and do your japa/meditation. Its wo=\r\nnderful. No disturbance at all. I used to do that everday. \nThe name of the=\r\n dasashmedh ghat is so because Brahma himself had done ten ashwamedha yagja=\r\ns on this ghat to invite Lord Shiva in Kasi. That is why the name is Das-as=\r\nhwamedha which has become Dashasamedha.\n=A0\nIn the kasikhanda, it is descri=\r\nbed that Lord Shiva took Ma Parvati along with him and showed to her what i=\r\ns called teh Abhimuktashetra. In the Jaballa Upanished this Abhimuktashetra=\r\n (Kasi - the area between Varuna and Ganga) has been described as the area =\r\nbetween the two eyebrows of a man.

What you can do is take a boat to teh otehr bank and then take =\r\na dip in the water. The boatman can charge you anytring between Rs100 to Rs=\r\n250 (depending on your bargaining skills).\n=A0\nThen among the temples I wou=\r\nld stronly suggest goign to Sankataji Temple. On fridays, the temple gets o=\r\nver crowded, there is a well in the temple called chandra kupa. \n=A0\nThen t=\r\nhe famous Durga Kund temple. Inside the temple, apart from teh main deity M=\r\na Chandi, there are also three other deities on the sides of the temple com=\r\nplex. Saraswati, Mahalakshmi and Ma Kali.
