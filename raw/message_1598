Care not for doctrine=\r\ns or for dogmas, for sects or for churches. All these count for but little =\r\ncompared with that essence of existence which is in each one, and \ncalled &#39;=\r\nspirituality&#39;.  The more this develops in a man, the more powerful is he fo=\r\nr good.  He who has most of it can do good most to his fellow man. First, t=\r\nhen, acquire that.  Only those who have seen it will understand this; but s=\r\nuch spirituality can be given to others, even though they be unconscious of=\r\n the gift. Only those who have attained to this power are amongst the great=\r\n teachers of mankind.  They are the powers of light. Then be you this!

Right action varies from person to person, from time to time \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n and from place to place. It is dependent on what nature expects from you, =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which in turn is based on who you have been in the past, what action=\r\ns you \n&gt; &gt; &gt; did in the past while identifying with the action, who you aff=\r\nected in the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; past (and how) with the actions that you identified wit=\r\nh, what debts you \n&gt; &gt; &gt; created in the process, and what mental tendencies=\r\n you accumulated until \n&gt; &gt; &gt; now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If, based on one&#39;s mental t=\r\nendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to kill evil perso=\r\nns, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.

If, based =\r\non one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person t=\r\no make a lot of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; money and construct a temple, that becomes one&#39;s dha=\r\nrma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; The dharma of a being may change from one life to another.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n At the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma to kill his gurus, =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; elders and relatives. The time then was such that there was too much=\r\n weight \n&gt; &gt; &gt; on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weig=\r\nht. Tremendous \n&gt; &gt; &gt; destruction was to take place and civilization destro=\r\nyed to a great extent, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it.=\r\n Arjuna being a great warrior, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it was his dharma to facilitate that.=\r\n Some people he deeply loved and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; respected were on the other side an=\r\nd it was his dharma to kill them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When the same Arjuna was bor=\r\nn again in the 19th century as one of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s sis=\r\nhyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; previous life, according =\r\nto Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different in this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; new time and plac=\r\ne. He was born to renounce material life despite his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; aristocratic up=\r\nbringing and live the simple life of a monk and inspire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; generations =\r\nto embrace a simple life of mental detachment and service to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; others.=\r\n When he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sai=\r\nd), his dharma based on the time and place may be something else.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The tricky=\r\n question is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s dharma?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some p=\r\neople have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your own dharma \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism. Though the concep=\r\nt \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long time, the c=\r\noncept of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra w=\r\nho lived by \n&gt; &gt; &gt; killing birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later=\r\n. Vishwamitra was a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a brahm=\r\nana and and a maharshi \n&gt; &gt; &gt; later. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. =\r\nOne starts off with the varna \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of father, because that is what one is=\r\n exposed to in childhood. As one \n&gt; &gt; &gt; develops in life, one gets one&#39;s ow=\r\nn varna based on what one does.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the misinterpretation of=\r\n Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to know your \n&gt; &gt; &gt; dharma from your caste=\r\n is wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the world. Each=\r\n person has individual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is is=\r\n very very very difficult. If one is pure \n&gt; &gt; &gt; enough, one will *know* on=\r\ne&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mind that tells us=\r\n what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; noise from oth=\r\ner parts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, we get \n&gt; &gt; &gt; confused=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; We should make the best judgment combining discrimination an=\r\nd intuition and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; decide what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. W=\r\ne may err, but doing \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the best we can is all that we can do!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; More than following dharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage =\r\nin \n&gt; &gt; &gt; actions without identification. *That* alone ensures that we are =\r\nnot \n&gt; &gt; &gt; accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should=\r\n not build \n&gt; &gt; &gt; too much attachment to what we are doing. We should engag=\r\ne in the best \n&gt; &gt; &gt; possible actions (based on our best judgment on what o=\r\nur dharma in the given \n&gt; &gt; &gt; situation is), with as little attachment and =\r\nself-identification with the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; action as possible. When the action is =\r\nfinished, we should leave the result \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to god. We should not think &quot;I =\r\ndid it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; work&quot; etc. Such adherence =\r\nof nishkama karma yoga (unfication through \n&gt; &gt; &gt; unattached action) will s=\r\nimplify our ego and purify our consciousness slowly. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As we become pu=\r\nrer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma clearer. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There i=\r\ns a positive feedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our \n&gt; &gt; &gt; dh=\r\narma clearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This is not easy, =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but not as difficult as people think.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The bottomline is=\r\n: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;this is=\r\n my dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one engages in action with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; lit=\r\ntle attachment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 =\r\n*\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are =\r\nthe inputs. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Another external input is the words of scriptures and le=\r\narned men. One can \n&gt; &gt; &gt; derive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place is=\r\n given to one&#39;s spiritual \n&gt; &gt; &gt; master. If one surrenders to a spiritual m=\r\naster, one can take the words of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the master to determine one&#39;s dharm=\r\na and follow it sincerely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When Arjuna was confused about what=\r\n his dharma was and thought killing gurus \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and relatives was not dhar=\r\nma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; dharma. When Narendra=\r\nnath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dharma \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and wanted to=\r\n renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do sadhana, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakr=\r\nishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the material \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; world and do the work of Mother for him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One who is not in =\r\ntune with nature and does not know who one is, what one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; debts are =\r\nand what nature expects from one can err in the judgment of what \n&gt; &gt; &gt; one=\r\n&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight into \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give perfect guidance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomline is=\r\n that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; declare =\r\nthat as the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person, from \n&gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nime to time and from place to place. Also, there are no thumbrules to find =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s understanding of=\r\n one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; dharma by increasing internal purity. By doing various kinds =\r\nof spiritual \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and engaging in actions=\r\n without much \n&gt; &gt; &gt; attachment, one can slowly purify oneself and refine o=\r\nne&#39;s understanding of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s individual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best reg=\r\nards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- ---------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Vedic=\r\nAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAs=\r\nt rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/=\r\nvedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.com=\r\ncast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologe=\r\nr.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.or=\r\ng\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot;=\r\n &lt;dahiyajiten@ yahoo.co. in&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Sent: Saturday, September 27, 2008 8:02 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom]=\r\n Dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Namaste to all\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; i just finished my Aghor=\r\na series\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and in it in last part\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Vimalanda says path of dharma=\r\n is very personal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Can somebody share views on that and how can we a=\r\npproach\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; towards it\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Does it has to do something with vedas and=\r\n upanishads\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; jitender\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From Chandigarh =\r\nto Chennai - find friends all over India.
