Mapping them to horoscope is not straight-forward.\n \nMaharsahi Parasara advised homam for all kinds of planetary problems. One can do homam irrespective of one&#39;s horoscope and worrying about whether it will &quot;play up the agni-tattwa and related planets&quot; in the horoscope. Moreover, a fire ritual and a tarpana were an integral part of the daily ritual of learned men not so long ago. They are safe for anybody.\n \n*        *        *\n \nHomam done to a soumya devata (gentle deity) such as Ganapathi, Lakshmi, Lalita, Krishna, Jupiter etc has some differences in the way it works, compared to homam done to an ugra devata (fierce/tough deity) such as Chandi, Kaali, Durga, Rudra, Mrityunjaya, Narasimha, Mars etc. (Deities may have both forms - like Hanuman - and it depends on which mantra you use and which form you are consciously or sub-consciously addressing.)\n \nLet me give an example. My wife Padmaja teaches various shlokas (Ganesha Pancharatnam, Aaditya hridayam, Subrahmanyaashtakam, Naama Raamaayanam, Hanumaan Chaalisa, Navagraha stotram, Ganapathi Atharva Seersham, Sri Suktam, Lingaashtakam etc and now Vishnu sahasra naama stotram) to kids in the neighborgood on Sunday evenings. Though she is fun-loving and has fun with children, she is very strict and harsh when it comes to learning. When my sister-in-law teaches kids, she is gentle and gives a lot of leeway to kids. But my wife is tough, forceful and strict in disciplining them. So all the kids are very alert and learn much faster with her. There may be moments when they experience some fear or even cry when she looks at them angrily, but they progress much faster.\n \nSimilarly, soumya devatas are gentle in cleansing and bringing transformation and progress can be slow. Ugra devatas are strict and tough and progress is faster.\n \n*        *        *\n \nWhen one does homam, the deity burns some of the blocking karmas of the person and brings positive karmas to fruition. Over time, this results in good developments in life and also cleansing, purification and eventual transformation of inherent nature.\n \nSuppose you are removing some rotten fruits at the top of a basket and throwing them in garbage, in order to extract a good fruit stuck under them. If you do it slowly, it will be fine. But, if you are in a hurry and do it too fast, a little bit of rotten stuff can spill over the floor.\n \nWhile soumya devatas are gentle and work slowly, ugra devatas are harsh and work fast. Any trouble you experience when doing ugra devata sadhana is like the rotten pieces spilled on the floor. But remember that the good fruit will be taken out faster in this approach.\n \nThis applies to all sadhanas of ugra devatas and not just homam, but homam is an accelerated form of sadhana.\n \nThose who can accept anything thrown at them by the chosen deity with a sense of surrender and without expectations can worship ugra devatas in fire and progress fast. But, those who want to go slower may want to stick to soumya devatas.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIn general, I recommend Mahaganapathi homam in the beginning for a few months atleast, before one starts another homam. If major blocking karmas are cleared by Ganapathi carefully and gracefully, one can think of fast track with another deity. That is the safest approach. The importance of Ganapathi sadhana before other sadhanas cannot be over-emphasized. It applies to homam too!\n \n*        *        *\n \nA gentle deity cannot tell Mrityu (Death personified): &quot;go away&quot;. Only a fierce deity can do so. Mrityunjaya mantra is for Mrityunjaya, a very fierce form of Shiva who scares away even Death (e.g. story of Markendeya). Even if you say Sadashiva in the sankalpam, it will be Mrityunjaya who comes into fire if you use Mrityunjaya mantra. He eventually makes you self-realized and immortal (deathless), but he has his aggressive way of going about doing it.\n \nIf you were simply doing a homam to Sadashiva using panchakshari mantra (with or without hreem), a gentle form of Shiva would come and results would be different.\n \nIf you want to get rid of the negative effect and yet continue homam, there are several options. One is to switch to another mantra such as panchakshari. Another is to use a samputa to ask Mrityunjaya to *protect* while giving spiritual progress. The samputa &quot;om jum sah&quot; at the beginning and &quot;sah jum om&quot; at the end can be used. This version is also there in Shiva homam manual. Third option is to do a half-hour Mahaganapathi homam for a few months and then switch to Mrityunjaya.\n \nBTW, your experience suggests to me that there is a spark and good potential in you. Also, my intuition tells me that Shiva is basically correct for you, though some more fine-tuning may be needed. I hope the Mother takes good care of you and your spiritual sadhana.\n \n*        *        *\n \nOne word on Homam vs Tarpana. In homam, you are calling devatas and the medium is fire. In tarpana, you are calling pitris and the medium is water. Both sadhanas are applicable to all people irrespective of whether watery signs/planets are strong or fiery signs/planets in their horoscope.\n \nIn homam, devatas come in fire and burn your blocking karmas to purify you. In tarpana, pitris come in water and free you from vasanas (conditioning of the mind) that were karmically inherited from them. If you have genes from (and rina with) an ancestor who was lustful or angry or jealous and the consciousness of the deceased ancestor is still having those thoughts, you will also suffer from such thoughts due to the connection and may even commit some bad karmas because of the weaknesses. You can free yourself from the rina by working on giving a rebirth to that ancestor. If the ancestor&#39;s consciousness is attached to a new body, the thoughts and cravings of that consciousness will not affect your consciousness. Thus, tarpana aims to cut off a strong source of bad karmas, while homam burns off previously committed bad karmas. Both are very important sadhanas for spiritual progress.\n \nDevatas are very subtle forms of consciousness. Their self-identification is to what is known as soul and represented by Sun. They work on your individual soul and free it from the karmas it carries. Pitris are grosser forms of consciousness with strong attachments and desires. Their self-identification is with what is known as mind and represented by Moon. You may note that Sun and Moon are associated with Devas and Pitris in the hora chart of astrology.\n \nDevas and pitris have different ways of working and influencing us and helping our spiritual progress. Both are relevant to all of us and have a role to play in our spiritual evolution.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n \n---- vedicastrostudent &lt;vedicastrostudent@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear Narasimhaji,\n&gt; \n&gt; I used your Homam manual to do the Mahamrityunjaya mantra. I have done\n&gt; this several times now over the past few weeks, early on Sunday\n&gt; mornings.  The thing that concerns me is that there is an unmistakably\n&gt; negative effect on one member of my family, and that person has a very\n&gt; strong exalted, simhasanamsa, unafflicted, badhakesh Sun conjoining AK\n&gt; Mercury.  I see this (the correlation between my doing the homam and the\n&gt; negative effect) over and over and over again, it doesnt seem to be my\n&gt; imagination. I dont want to go too deep in the details.\n&gt; \n&gt; I know you cant analyze anything based on such little detail, but\n&gt; clearly fire-based worship does seem to &quot;play up&quot; the agni-tattwa and\n&gt; related planets, no? Are there &quot;cooler&quot;, perhaps water-based forms of\n&gt; worship too? After these thoughts came to my head, I saw that you have a\n&gt; Pitri tarpana manual and it is water-based(!) as well.. But I dont\n&gt; understand it well. Can you please explain a bit of the astrology of\n&gt; these worships - am I mistaken in noting this increase in agni-tattwa\n&gt; based planets, and &quot;wanting&quot; &quot;cooler&quot; forms of worship? A long time ago,\n&gt; I started listening to/chanting the Gayatri mantra, and I only saw\n&gt; positive effects there (but there was no fire involved)..\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you very much in advance,\n&gt; \n&gt; Sundeep\n\n\n"}}
