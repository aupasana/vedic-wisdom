Needless to say, my neighbors =\r\nwill call &gt;9-1-1 in no-time :)\n\nThe above lighter quote is actually a pract=\r\nical worry which many aspirants harbour and rightly so. I am inspired to wr=\r\nite my story in this regard. Hoping that it can inspire somebody on the lis=\r\nt and removes mainly the fear factor.\n\n***\nabout 2.5 years back, Narasimha =\r\nwrote to me this: &quot;Do whatever compromises, but 20 minutues Homam every day=\r\n is a must. find out ways to do that&quot;. I remember different fears i was hav=\r\ning in my mind. I was then staying as a paying guest with a family. though =\r\ni had a separte room, i was not sure if they would allow me to do something=\r\n related to fire. that was the main worry. then there was self doubt concer=\r\nning my ability to perform Homam but I decided to perform and did the first=\r\n Homam which was Maha Ganapati homam on 1st day of Ashwin Navaraatri. I rem=\r\nember that i took me around 2.5 hours total including all the preparation a=\r\nfter that rest of the 8 days, i performed Chandi Homams. each Chandi homam =\r\ntook around 4 hours. I remember that on the Ashtami day, some of My colleag=\r\nues with family came to see my chandi Homam and they told me that the smoke=\r\n was even visible in the ground floor (The Apartment i was staying was on 4=\r\nth) and there were nice smell every where. The interesting thing is that Ol=\r\nd lady of the family actually co-operated with me. she used to help me in c=\r\nutting Dray coconut in to small peices with knife. I cut my finger on sever=\r\nal occasions while cutting coconuts for chandi homam. I used to offer the b=\r\nlood stained coconut peices in Chandi Homas.\n\nMy all previous fears thus pr=\r\noved absolutely Non-existent. From the very first Homam, It was a smooth ri=\r\nde. I was exahusted after Navaratri and could not continue and there was a =\r\nbreak of a week or so. Then again i started daily Maha Ganapti Homam while =\r\nlearnt the technic of breaking Dry coconut halves by crushing it with both =\r\npalms.\n\nAfter few months, I had to look for another Sharing Apartment. I tr=\r\nied to search for it. few families rejected when i put the condition of doi=\r\nng Homam everyday. at last One christian family agreed for that. I paid big=\r\nger amount but they allowed me to do homam and i continued there for around=\r\n 3 months. during that time i also took vow to do homam and Chadni Path eve=\r\nryday for 1 year.\n\nafter 3 months, i started searching for my own separate =\r\nRental Apartment because my family was joining me. Again the same concern (=\r\nPrime) is to search for Apartment where there is no obstacle to do Homam. I=\r\n got a brand new apartment. I observed the flat and finalised the dealing. =\r\ncontinued Homam every day for 1 year. The whole flat became black. even the=\r\n Home applicances liem refrigerator etc.. were covered with black dust of H=\r\noma smoke. clothes in the wardrobe, Openings of Central A/c etc... were all=\r\n filled with black dust. My whole brand new apartment became dark due to th=\r\ne Homam. Smoke particles travelled to my lungs and throat and i started cou=\r\nghing badly. I suffered with severe Cough for many months and there was pre=\r\nssure from near ones to stop Homam or atleast perform it once every week. B=\r\nut there was lot of determination provided by *some power* which i like to =\r\ncall as &quot;Mother&quot;.\n\nAfter 1 year in that Apartment, i started serching diffe=\r\nrent place. I searched whole area and was looking for a apartment which als=\r\no has Balcony so that My homam goes smoothly without nmaking my whole aprtm=\r\nent look black and there are no more complaints from my wife .\nI could not =\r\nget one such perfect place which gives me a Blacony and at the same time th=\r\nere are no buidlings in front which can observe me doing homam in balcony a=\r\nnd make a instant complaint to police and/or fire Brigade. Balcony was very=\r\n comfirtable and required option so that i can do it there and smoke handli=\r\nng becomes very easy but at the same time it is also that much risky becaus=\r\ne any road-side person can complain seeing smoke comming out.\nFinally i got=\r\n one aprtment without balcony but with a special location. When i vacated t=\r\nhe previous apartment, the owner&#39;e representative was shell-shocked looking=\r\n at the condition of the apartment :) He told me over Phone - &quot;Aaap Kya kar=\r\nata tha flat me?&quot;. He then deducted 1000 AED from my deposit for the compen=\r\nsation. I happily agreed because i knew that it was a great deal instaed of=\r\n going to police station.\n\nIn new Apartment (current one), security is very=\r\n tight. But I decided to make an arrangement so that i do not *spoil* condi=\r\ntion of the  Apartment. hence i came out with the Idea of Chimney. (Please =\r\nsee the more pictures in photo section) and started doing Homam. Though the=\r\n chimney is visible to neighbours and other flat owners, no body has compla=\r\nined till now. neither to police nor to security personnel. Only once Secur=\r\nity person cautiuoned me. I stopped for a few days and started as usual. It=\r\n is going on till today. I do not know about tomorrow but i do not worry. b=\r\necuase after 2.5 years of experience, it is more than clear to me that It i=\r\ns not I who is arranging all these but there is Mother behind all these. SH=\r\nE is making my road clear so that i can perform Homam as i wish.\n\n***\nThe m=\r\noral of the story is that if you genuinely desire to perform Homam/Havan, t=\r\nhen It will be done. No obstacle will stand on your way.\nDo not fear. All t=\r\nhe fears will break like Papads once you start walking over them to do homa=\r\nm. i can swear for it!\n\nNo owner will kick you out, No neighbour will call =\r\n9-1-1 and even if that happens, there will open a way!\n\nBest Regards,\n\n\nUtp=\r\nal\nPS: Forgive me for spellings and Grammar! \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, &quot;astro_student75&quot; &lt;astro.sishya@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Utpal Ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; Tha=\r\nnks very much for the photo.
