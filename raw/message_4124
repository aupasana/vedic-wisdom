Vengu Iyer and Parvati Ammal on the 8th September 1887 at Pattamadai, T=\r\ninnevelly District, Tamil Nadu in the line of Appayya Dikshit. My star is B=\r\nharani. I was extremely mischievous in my boyhood. I studied in the S.P.G. =\r\nCollege, Trichinopoly. I was a Doctor in the Malaya States for 10 years. I =\r\ntook sannyasa in 1924 in Rishikesh. I did tapas and meditation for 15 years=\r\n. I went on teaching tours for 10 years. I founded the Divine Life Society =\r\nin 1936 and the All-World Religious Federation in 1945.\n\nI am childlike in =\r\nmy Svabhava. So I mix with all. I become one with all. I am ever happy and =\r\njoyful and make others also happy and joyful. I am full of educative humour=\r\n. I radiate joy through humour. I respect all. I do salutations to all firs=\r\nt. I always speak sweetly. I walk quickly. I do japa and meditation while w=\r\nalking and while at work also.\n\nI am ever hard-working. I have intense appl=\r\nication to work. I never procrastinate any work. I finish it then and there=\r\n. I am very quick in doing things. I cannot suppress the spirit of service =\r\nin me. I cannot live without service. I take immense delight in service. Se=\r\nrvice has elevated me. Service has purified me. I know well how to extract =\r\nwork from others. I extract work through kindness, service, respect and lov=\r\ne.\n\nI am very regular in doing Asana and exercises. I do Pranayama also reg=\r\nularly. These give me wonderful health and energy. I run round the Bhajan H=\r\nall daily. I cannot deliver fiery lectures sitting on a special seat. Speci=\r\nal seat pricks me. I stand up or throw the seat away and then begin to spea=\r\nk. I never sat on a special seat when I presided over spiritual conferences=\r\n. I rejoice in giving. I always give.\n\nI am 73 now. I ever feel I am quite =\r\nyoung. I am full of vigour, vim and vitality. I am ever cheerful. I sing, d=\r\nance, run, jump in joy. I am robust and strong. I can digest any kind of fo=\r\nod. I continuously work, read and write. I never go to hill-stations or sea=\r\nside for holiday. Change of work gives rest. Meditation gives abundant rest=\r\n. Work gives me delight. Service gives me happiness. Writing bestows joy. M=\r\neditation energises and invigorates me. Kirtan vivifies me.\n\n&quot;Aham Brahma A=\r\nsmi&quot;, &quot;Sivoham&quot;, &quot;Soham Sat-Chit-Ananda Svarupoham&quot;. This is my favourite f=\r\normula for Vedantic meditation. Song of &quot;Chidananda&quot; is my favourite song f=\r\nor singing.\n\n&quot;Hare Rama Hare Rama\nRama Rama Hare Hare,\nHare Krishna Hare Kr=\r\nishna\nKrishna Krishna Hare Hare.&quot;\n\nThis Mahamantra Kirtan is my favourite K=\r\nirtan.\n\nAt the present moment I am the richest man in the whole world. My h=\r\neart is full. Further, all the wealth of the Lord belongs to me now. Hence,=\r\n I am King of Kings, Emperor of Emperors, Shah of Shahs, Maharaja of Mahara=\r\njas. I take pity on the mundane kings. My dominion is limitless. My wealth =\r\nis inexhaustible. My joy is inexpressible. My treasure is immeasurable. I a=\r\nttained this through sannyasa, renunciation, untiring selfless service, jap=\r\na, and meditation.\n\nI am tall. My height is 6 ft. I have a sinewy frame. I =\r\nhave symmetrical limbs. I am a first-class gymnast. I fast on ekadasi. I do=\r\n not take even a drop of water on that day. I take milk and fruits on Sunda=\r\nys. I lead a simple natural life. There is a fountain of youth in me. I bea=\r\nm with joy. I observe fasting, resting, airing, bathing, breathing, exercis=\r\ning, sun-bathing and enjoy freedom, beauty, courage, poise and health.\n\nI l=\r\nove nature, music, art, poetry, philosophy, beauty, goodness, solitude, med=\r\nitation, yoga and Vedanta. I am humble and simple. I am frank and straightf=\r\norward. I am perfectly tolerant and catholic. I am merciful and sympathetic=\r\n. I have spontaneous and unrestrained generosity. I am bold and cheerful. I=\r\n am patient. I can bear insult and injury. I am forgiving. I am free from v=\r\nindictive nature. I return good for evil. I serve that man who has injured =\r\nme, with joy.\n\nI love Ganga and the Himalayas. Ganga is my Mother Divine. H=\r\nimalayas is my Father Divine. They inspire and guide me. I take bath in Gan=\r\nga. I adore Ganga. I feed the fishes of Ganga. I wave light to Mother Ganga=\r\n. I pray to Ganga. I do salutations to Ganga. I sing the glory of Ganga. I =\r\nwrite about the grandeur and glory of Ganga. Ganga has nourished me. Ganga =\r\nhas comforted me. Ganga has taught me the Truths of the Upanishads. Glory t=\r\no Mother Ganga!\n\nMy daily routine is like that of Lord Buddha. I always rem=\r\nain in the room. I do japa, kirtan and meditation. I study sacred books. I =\r\nwrite. I come out of the room for a short time for work, service and interv=\r\niew. I talk a little. I think much. I meditate much. I try to do much and s=\r\nerve much. I do not waste even a single minute. I ever keep myself fully oc=\r\ncupied. I lead a well-regulated life. I perform worship of Atman at all tim=\r\nes. I work for the good of others.\n\nGita, Upanishads, Bhagavata, Yoga Vasis=\r\nhtha, Avadhoota Gita, Vivekachudamani are my constant companions. I am a st=\r\nrange mixture of service, devotion, yoga and wisdom. I am a follower of Sri=\r\n Sankara. I am a Kevala-Advaita Vedantin. I am not at all a dry lip Vedanti=\r\nn. I am a practical Vedantin. I practice and advocate the Yoga of Synthesis=\r\n. I practice ahimsa, satyam and brahmacharya. Glory to Sri Sankara!\n\nI resp=\r\nect all saints and prophets of all religions. I respect all religions, all =\r\ncults, all faiths and all creeds. I serve all, love all, mix with all and s=\r\nee the Lord in all. I stick to my promises. I serve the poor. This gives me=\r\n delight. I do mental prostrations to asses, dogs, trees, bricks, stones an=\r\nd all creatures. I respect elders and sadhus. I obey. I please all through =\r\nsincere selfless service. I attend on guests very carefully. I run hither a=\r\nnd thither to serve them. I massage the legs of sick persons and sadhus.\n\nI=\r\n give very prompt reply to all letters. I do several things at a time. I wr=\r\nite with electric speed. I spend everything. I do a lot of charity. I do no=\r\nt keep anything. I take immense pleasure in feeding the poor and my student=\r\ns. I try to be a mother to them. I talk to others on things which I have my=\r\nself practiced. I look within always, introspect, analyse and examine. I ho=\r\nld the Trisul=96spiritual diary, daily routine and resolve.\n\nI served my ma=\r\nsters with great sincerity and intense faith and devotion. I learnt many us=\r\neful lessons for life. I developed many virtues. I wandered without food du=\r\nring my parivrajaka life. I slept on the roadside at night without clothing=\r\n during winter. I ate dried bread with water. I stick tenaciously with my p=\r\nrinciples and ideals. I do not argue much. I live in silence.\n\nI pray and d=\r\no kirtan for the whole world, for the health and peace of sick people and f=\r\nor the peace of the departed souls and the earth-bound spirits also. I take=\r\n a dip in the Ganges in the name of all those who are longing for a bath in=\r\n the Ganges. I sing the names of all saints of all religions in the bhajan =\r\nhall. I observe All-Saints&#39; Day and All-Souls&#39; Day.\n\nI constantly meditate =\r\non the following:-\n\nPrajnanam Brahma [Consciousness is Brahman], Aham Brahm=\r\na Asmi [I am Brahman], Tat Tvam Asi [Thou art That], Ayam Atma Brahma [This=\r\n Self (Atman) is Brahman (the previous four phrases are call mahavakyas, &quot;g=\r\nreat sayings,&quot; from the Upanishads)], Satyam Jnanam Anantam Brahma. Santam =\r\nSivam Advaitam. Aham Atma Gudakesa, Aham Atma Nirakarah, Sarvavyapee Svabha=\r\nvatah. Brahma Satyam Jaganmithya Jivo Brahmaiva Naparah. Akarta, Abhokta, A=\r\nsanga Sakshee. Ajo Nityah Sasvatoyam Purano. Jyotishamapi Tat Jyotih.\n\nTo r=\r\naise the fallen, to lead the blind, to share what I have with others, to br=\r\ning solace to the afflicted and to cheer the afflicted and suffering are my=\r\n ideals. To have perfect faith in God, to love my neighbour as my own Self,=\r\n to love God with all my heart and soul, to protect cows, animals, women an=\r\nd children are my aims. My watchword is love. My goal is Sahaja samadhi ava=\r\nstha, or the natural, continuous superconscious state.\n\n\n\n"}}
