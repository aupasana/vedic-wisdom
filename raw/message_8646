How many\nof us will ask their Guru to try out different Spiritual Pract=\r\nice and\ngive a comparative study? I think you are treating him as Spiritual=\r\n\nConsultant.\n\nAnyway, as Narasimha ji has said it is finally individual pre=\r\nference. So\neven he try out on request, what do you expect him to say one i=\r\ns 80%\neffective, same, or 110% effective. He will still say that this is my=\r\n\ncomparative judgment but it may be different for you.  So best you try\nout=\r\n and read his post on spiritual progress and judge what works better\nfor yo=\r\nu, or you want both.\n\nNow on my experience, I learnt SK in 2002 and within =\r\n25 days learnt PS. \nI have practiced both regularly for 1 years and SK alon=\r\ne for 7 years. I\nhave done Advance course 8 times. Also have listen Narad B=\r\nhakti Sutra,\nAstavakra Geeta etc. As you mentioned that AOL service is cons=\r\nidered\nvery important part, I had also done lots of volunteering activities=\r\n in\nAOL including being Administrator for Primary School. Since 2009, I hav=\r\ne\nstopped practicing SK, as I felt that I after initial couple of years of\n=\r\nprogress, I did not find progressing much on spiritual level. I found\nreall=\r\ny helpful in stress relief and mental calmness, but considered\ncommodity/re=\r\ntail spirituality.\n\nNow from last 10 months, by taking Ganapathi as Guru, I=\r\n have started\ndoing japa every day and homam every weekend. I have not spen=\r\nt equal\namount of time in Homam as in SK practice to give you comparison. Y=\r\nes,\nit will take longer than SK to master the technique, and initially mind=\r\n\nis more occupied in maintaining the fire.\n\nSo can only say, if you like in=\r\n the reasoning and explanation of\nNarasimha ji, better try yourself and see=\r\n how you feel. Anyway, AoL also\nteaches Agnihotra, and also homam in their =\r\nVeda school. During Navaratri\nin Bangalore ashram there are all the homam d=\r\none. So  Homam is not\ncontradiction to AOL.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nRegards,\n\nMi=\r\nhir.\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, vinayak tandle &lt;vinayakmechie@...=\r\n&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Guruji,\n&gt; I consider you as my Guru as you are the one=\r\n of the 4\n&gt; prominent people who have influenced & inspired me on spiritual=\r\n\npath(whatever\n&gt; little I do) & I find your explanations\n&gt; very very convin=\r\ncing.

If one l=\r\nikes grilled sandwiches, forcing one to eat rice and dal may not work.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Similarly, do you get more spiritual strength by doin=\r\ng homam with a mantra or japam with a mantra or pranayama with a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ma=\r\nntra or so many sadhana paths?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; It is possible to =\r\nget balanced spiritual progress through each path. However, if one likes si=\r\nnging prayers, forcing one to do pranayama may not work. If one likes japam=\r\n, forcing one to do homam may not work.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *=C2&nbsp=\r\n;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp; *=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=\r\n=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; W=\r\nhat style of food one eats, how many times a day one eats, how much food on=\r\ne eats each time is secondary (though it matters too). How well one is enjo=\r\nying food and digesting it is primary.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Similarly,=\r\n what sadhana one does, how many years one does sadhana for and how many ho=\r\nurs one spends in sadhana everyday is secondary (though it matters too). Ho=\r\nw involved one is in and how much one is enjoying sadhana is primary.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If one finds a sadhana that one can enjoy and engage i=\r\nn without forcing oneself mechanically and if one feels love and attachment=\r\n to the tools, symbols&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and steps involved in that sadhana, one is l=\r\nucky. Otherwise, one may engage in a sadhana mechanically for a long time w=\r\nithout making much progress.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; But, realize that on=\r\ne may have to try many cuisines before finding what one really loves. Secon=\r\ndly, one may dislike a cuisine at first and slowly get hooked. All these va=\r\nriables are there. But, eventually, one needs to enjoy what one is eating, =\r\nto digest well. Similarly, one needs to eventually start enjoying one&#39;s sad=\r\nhana, to progress spiritually.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp=\r\n;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp; *=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=\r\n=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Having sai=\r\nd that, fire is something separate and special. Almost every ancient cultur=\r\ne and civilization worshipped god in sacred fire.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n No matter what kind of food one eats, eating some ginger can provoke one&#39;s=\r\n appetite and make one digest better. Similarly, no matter what kind of sad=\r\nhana one does, doing some fire worship can&lt;BR&gt;&gt; provoke one&#39;s internal f=\r\nire and make one digest better.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Also, just as a g=\r\nood nutritionist working with one can help one in picking the right balance=\r\n of foods, a good guru or mentor working with one can help one in picking t=\r\nhe right balance of sadhanas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; So a good guru/ment=\r\nor and company of fire are two things that put one in good stead, irrespect=\r\nive of what else one does.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2=\r\n&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp; *=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&=\r\nnbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I do not like =\r\nto comment on specific people or organizations. But, I&#39;d *in general* be su=\r\nspicious of anyone who says they have a special and effective spiritual pat=\r\nh, then controls and guards the details tightly and puts a price on it. Tha=\r\nt is not the way of rishis. That is not the way of Sanatana Dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; But if one tries such a path and benefits, good for them=\r\n. I&#39;d personally stay away from such organizations.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; BTW, I am&lt;BR&gt;&gt; not a &quot;guruji&quot;, though I answered your question.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; --------&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; --------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Guruji, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Please explain do we burn bad karma by performing homa or&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; sudarshan kriya o&#92;f art of living.
