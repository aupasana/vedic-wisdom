Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nNamaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Two points...\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) My definition of ishta devata is the s=\r\npecific deity for whom one has \n&gt; done the most intense sadhana in the past=\r\n. If one does sadhana for the same \n&gt; deity, one progresses and achieves qu=\r\nickly.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, as I maintain always, our understanding of astrologica=\r\nl formulas is \n&gt; imperfect. It is not at all easy to figure out the ishta d=\r\nevata from the \n&gt; horoscope. Though there are guidelines from rishis, our u=\r\nnderstanding of \n&gt; those guidelines is imperfect.\n&gt; \n&gt; A sadguru will be ab=\r\nle to give you better guidance in this matter than an \n&gt; astrologer. I say =\r\nit confidently despite being an astrologer who studied \n&gt; various ancient a=\r\nnd modern Jyotish authors and experimented a lot.\n&gt; \n&gt; (2) Not knowing the =\r\nspecific form with which one has a strong connection is \n&gt; not as big a hin=\r\ndrance as one may think. If one is not sufficiently pure to \n&gt; start with, =\r\nworshipping the correct deity does not magically make one \n&gt; realized. It w=\r\nill still take a very very long time. On the other hand, if \n&gt; one is suffi=\r\nciently pure already, other deities will guide one towards ishta \n&gt; devata =\r\nautomatically.\n&gt; \n&gt; Searching for ishta devata is not like searching for a =\r\nlost object. A deity \n&gt; is intelligent unlike a lost object and a deity can=\r\n pull you towards \n&gt; him/her, if you have an intense desire to make spiritu=\r\nal progress and start \n&gt; making progress. After all, a mother or father may=\r\n play hide and seek with a \n&gt; child for a while, but they will not hide for=\r\n too long if the child is lost \n&gt; and confused and unable to find the hidin=\r\ng parent!\n&gt; \n&gt; If you learn to be like an innocent and helpless child and i=\r\nf you have a \n&gt; genuine desire to make spiritual progress, your ishta devat=\r\na will \n&gt; automatically pull you towards him/her.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I say that one sh=\r\nould not worry too much about such things or run around \n&gt; astrologers whos=\r\ne knowledge is imperfect or sometimes downright incorrect. \n&gt; Pray to which=\r\never deity you feel like praying to and work on your attitude. \n&gt; Surrender=\r\n to that deity. You will be sown your path.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; H=\r\naving said that, my educated *guess* is that Vishnu will suit you.
