I thank you for guiding me so detailed... without you=\r\nr manual it would never be possible.\n\nInteresting point to note, that in De=\r\nc of 2005 I visited India and stayed with a Brahmin family for about 10 day=\r\ns and the ONLY PURPOSE of my visit was to learn doing homam! However I was =\r\ndisappoint because their procedure was so big that it would take about 3 ho=\r\nurs for the homam, and many more materials also. Of course, they learnt it =\r\nfrom &#39;guru-kulam&#39; and it was their own tradition. They are not a modern res=\r\nearcher like you [Narasimha Ji] who could compare many traditions, research=\r\n on them, and even come up with a shorter version. They had no idea that a =\r\nshorter version is possible, or something can be left out. As an example, t=\r\nhey suggested a mantadory japam of 10x times before I do an &#39;x&#39; times offer=\r\ning in homam, and many more formalities.\n\nSo, I knew in Bangladesh I would =\r\nnever have so much materials needed, and I would not be able to perform a 3=\r\n hour homam regularly, so it was of no use. \n\nMuch later when I was reading=\r\n your manual, I remember about Achamanan, Raksha etc. from their teaching :=\r\n-)\n\nAnyway Ji...\n\nEverything was almost as per recommendation, except I use=\r\nd a melamine spoon to offer ghee, because I couldn&#39;t manage a wooden spoon =\r\neven after a lot of effort. May be I have to order it... but I will have to=\r\n work much hard to find a craft-man who can make a spoon with wood.\n\nI burn=\r\nt the fire with mango-wood and jute-sticks.\n\nPurnahuti with ghee only.\n\nTha=\r\nt WAS the problem. Soon after starting the fire, I had an idea how fast the=\r\n woods were burning. So while I was moving with the homam, I knew that with=\r\n a big stream of ghee as a purnahuti, the fire will not survive long to all=\r\now me meditate even 5 mins. Because the woods were burning out fast.\n\nSo I =\r\ncould not meditate.\n\nMy first Q. - 1) Would you have any suggestion how can=\r\n I make the fire last long so that it burns for at least 10 mins allowing m=\r\ne mediate? I noted even if I had put much wood, they would still burn out f=\r\nast...\n\nOffering full / half coconut seems to be the only thing that would =\r\nkeep the fire alive for 10-15 mins and let me meditate.\n\nAnother Q. - 2) I =\r\nhave sliced coconut copras and drying them for last 3-4 days, I can dry the=\r\nm no matter how long it takes, so that I can use them as suggested in the m=\r\nanual. HOWEVER, my question is - how to I dry a &quot;FULL&quot; coconut so much that=\r\n it becomes BURNABLE for purnahuti? I mean, I am drying sliced coconuts... =\r\nbut if I keep a full coconut somewhere for a few days, will not it be rotte=\r\nn or something? Any procedure? I am asking this because here no one has any=\r\n idea about that, because no one even thinks of having &quot;burnable&quot; full coco=\r\nnuts. That is why.\n\nMantras work very strong for me. But I feel not strong =\r\nenough for big spiritual or material effects. I have had very strong experi=\r\nences with homam before while performing with others. Even a few times I *a=\r\nrranged* homams for others and I always directly felt a strong effect worki=\r\nng on me also.\n\nToday with the homam, the effect was not that strong. I kno=\r\nw why, because it was a super-short homam, with many mantras left. Also, I =\r\nshould honestly admit that when I imagined Lord Ganesha and Lord Shani Deva=\r\n in the fire, the imagination was not 100% strong. Because, I was worried a=\r\nnd nervous about making mistake, so I could not 100% focus on their presenc=\r\ne. Which I should. I guess it will improve with time.\n\nI am going to add ma=\r\nntras from the main homam soon, common mantras which are needed in all homa=\r\nms like Anugya, Kalasha Suddhi, Agni Deva prayer etc. Also I guess Avahana-=\r\nrelated Sanskrit mantras are very important.\n\nBy the way I did 108 offering=\r\ns with Veda-Vyasa Shani mantra and then 21 offerings with the smallest Shan=\r\ni mantra again.\n\nI am thankful to the ultimate divinity that at least I did=\r\nn&#39;t have any negative experience after the homam. I was pretty nervous abou=\r\nt the possibility. Because long back in 2002-2003 when I started mantras, a=\r\nlmost everyday I faced negative energies for the imperfection of pronunciat=\r\nion and procedures. Sometimes the negatives were so strong. But I didn&#39;t gi=\r\nve up and tried to understand the correct ways because since I saw the powe=\r\nr in it, I had to find what&#39;s the right way to get the pure blessings, avoi=\r\nding mistakes.\n\nAs an example, you [Narasimha Ji] instructed to stay in an =\r\nempty stomach while doing homam. I find this 100% true from my mantra japam=\r\n experience. Though no website or almost no one instructed me to stay empty=\r\n stomached in japam, I found that mantras work very strong with empty stoma=\r\nch. Also, I always got strong negative effects when I did japam after my di=\r\nnner. Thus, I learned this from my own experience but after a lot of troubl=\r\nes faced [for the wrong practices I did]! Now days, I can&#39;t eat anything af=\r\nter my lunch... because I do mantras in the evening. At times it becomes ve=\r\nry difficult not to eat something as I sometimes hang out with friends etc.=\r\n at afternoon or early evening. But I have no choice.\n\nThat is the thing I =\r\nappreciate about you [Narasimha Ji] to make the small [yet very important] =\r\nthings always mentioned.\n\nSame thing about your instruction of minimum move=\r\nment of the body, I find it very correct.\n\nAnyway Ji I guess I am stretchin=\r\ng my mail very long...\n\nmy 3rd Q. - 3) As per your manual if I take Shani a=\r\ns an expression of the ultimate cosmic power or divinity, I can offer other=\r\n Gods&#39; mantras in fire too. Can I do a Navagraha homam this way, or at leas=\r\nt a homam for 6-7 grahas?\n\n4) If yes, should I maintain the graha order suc=\r\nh as Surya, Chandra, Kuja and so on?\n\n5) Is there any exceptional instructi=\r\non while doing homam of Rahu and Ketu etc., or just like Shani?\n\nWanted to =\r\nmention that I am also planning to do homam of Maha Lakshmi and other deiti=\r\nes but manuals for those deities are already there, hence these additional =\r\nquestions about graha-homams.\n\nAppreciate your time to answer me.\n\nThanking=\r\n you again,\nTanvir\n\n\n"}}
