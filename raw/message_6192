[But] there is a twofold proof for the unity of the=\r\n\nreal Self, namely the experience of the sage and the argument that he has\n=\r\ngiven.\n\n415 Our Guru Sri Ramana says that because the Self shines in the sa=\r\nme way as\n=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, in all bodies he is one, and only one.\n\nNow =\r\na warning is given for the benefit of immature aspirants against a\nmisuse o=\r\nf the theoretical knowledge herein so far given. This is taken from\nBhagava=\r\nn Sri Sankaracharya=E2=80=99s Tattvopadesa, in which it is the last verse.\n=\r\n\n416 One should meditate upon the truth of non-duality with effort, but\nsho=\r\nuld not apply this truth in his [worldly] activities. [Also] one may\nthink =\r\nof non-duality in respect of all the three worlds, but should not\nimagine s=\r\nuch [non-difference] with the Guru.\n\nThe reason is that theoretical knowled=\r\nge of the truth of non-duality does\nnot avail to destroy the primary ignora=\r\nnce, so as to raise one to the\negoless state, wherein wrong action would be=\r\n impossible. So, till that state\nis won, the ego would be in command of act=\r\nions, and this warning is\ntherefore necessary.\n\nNext the question is raised=\r\n and dealt with as to how the physical body and\nthe world as a whole appear=\r\n to the sage.\n\n417 How can the world appear to the sage in the same way as =\r\nit does to the\nignorant? The Guru tells us in what way the world appears to=\r\n the sage.\n\nThe next verse gives the answer briefly, but also clearly.\n\n418=\r\n The world, which to the ignorant appears as comprising the trinity of\nGod,=\r\n the jivas and the insentient objects, appears as the Self to the sage\ndue =\r\nto the liquidation of the superimposed false appearance of the world.\n\nThis=\r\n is explained in detail as follows.\n\n419 The sage who has attained his natu=\r\nral state, which is the supreme state,\nremains in his natural freedom. He i=\r\ns free from delusion and sees nothing\nother than the Self. How then can he =\r\nsee anything unreal?\n\n420 Therefore the sage, established as he is in his n=\r\natural state, the\nsupreme state, would say that the body, appearing as =E2=\r\n=80=98his=E2=80=99 body to others,\nand the world are real.\n\nBut there is a =\r\nworld of difference in the meaning [of what he says] because\nthe superimpos=\r\nition does not appear [as real] to the sage.\n\nNow it may be questioned whet=\r\nher the sage also, like us, does not need the\ndiscrimination between the re=\r\nal and the unreal. The answer is given below.\n\n421 The outlook of discrimin=\r\nation is enjoined [only] on the aspirant for\ndeliverance, not on him who ha=\r\ns won deliverance. A confused outlook is\npossible for the former, not for t=\r\nhe latter.\n\nThe views that the two have of the body is next explained and d=\r\nistinguished.\n\n422 The ignorant one, because of his confounding of the body=\r\n with the Self,\nthinks of himself as =E2=80=98with form=E2=80=99 and co-ext=\r\nensive with that body. The sage\nis aware of the Self as infinite, formless =\r\nbeing; this is the distinction in\nthe meaning of what is said by these two.=\r\n\n\n423 What is seen as =E2=80=98the body=E2=80=99 by the ignorant appears to=\r\n the sage only as\nthe Self. He refers to it as =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, ignorin=\r\ng the body-form through his right\nawareness.\n\nNext it is explained that the=\r\n outlook of the sage towards the world is\ndifferent from that of the ignora=\r\nnt one.\n\n424 Also, when the two say that the world is real, there is a diff=\r\nerence in\nthe meaning, though the words are the same. For the ignorant one,=\r\n the\nreality is veiled by differences, while to the sage, it appears as it =\r\nreally\nis.\n\n425 Unaware of the substratum of the world-appearance, seeing [=\r\nonly] the\nsuperimposed multitude of [inert] objects, and believing that thi=\r\ns world of\nobjects is real in its own right, the ignorant one says, =E2=80=\r\n=98The world is\nreal=E2=80=99.\n\n426 [On the other hand] for the sage there =\r\nshines only the substratum, which\nis the pure reality, nameless and formles=\r\ns. For him the superimposition does\nnot appear as real. [That being the cas=\r\ne], how can he say that the world is\nunreal?\n\nThe contrast here is between =\r\nthe substratum and the superimposed appearance.\nThe ignorant one is unaware=\r\n that there is a substratum. The sage is unaware\nof the superimposed appear=\r\nance.\n\n427 This world which, to the one whose eye is blinded by unawareness=\r\n of his\nown real Self, conceals the Supreme Being, is, by [the power of] th=\r\nat same\nSupreme Being, concealed to the one whose eye is purified by the ri=\r\nght\nawareness of that Self.\n\nThis is the meaning conveyed by the opening ve=\r\nrse of the Isa Upanishad.\nSupposing that the sage does see the world of nam=\r\nes and form. It is\nexplained that the sage=E2=80=99s view is unclouded by i=\r\ngnorance.\n\n428 Just as one who has become wise to the truth of the mirage m=\r\nay again see\nthe mirage without being deluded, so too the sage, seeing this=\r\n world, does\nnot think of it as real, as does the ignorant one.\n\nThus there=\r\n is no comparison at all between the ignorant man and the sage.\nThis is sho=\r\nwn next.\n\n429 This world is not real in the sense in which it is believed t=\r\no be real\nby the ignorant man. Ignorant ones do not understand the sense in=\r\n which the\nworld is seen [as real] by the sage.\n\n430 That which appears to =\r\nthe ignorant ones as diversified by a great many\ndifferences, as =E2=80=98f=\r\norms=E2=80=99 and as =E2=80=98other than the Self=E2=80=99, is, to the sage=\r\n, only\nthe Self, undifferentiated and formless.\n\nIt is then explained that =\r\nthe teaching about the world is two-fold, as\nunreal from one viewpoint and =\r\nreal from another viewpoint.\n\n431 It is not taught that the world is comple=\r\ntely unreal. It is not [unreal]\nlike the horn of man or a horse. If it were=\r\n wholly unreal, it would not\nappear at all. But it does appear because of i=\r\nts confusion with its\nsubstratum, the reality.\n\nThe two kinds of unrealitie=\r\ns are further explained, for the sake of\ndistinction.\n\n432 The unreality th=\r\nat has no substratum, such as the son of a barren woman\nand the like, does =\r\nnot appear at all. But the unreality which appears on a\nsubstratum, like th=\r\ne snake seen in a rope, appears as real.\n\nThe presence or absence of a subs=\r\ntratum makes all the difference. No one is\nmisled into thinking that a barr=\r\nen woman=E2=80=99s son has any existence, because he\ndoes not appear at all=\r\n. On the other hand, the snake not only appears, but\nit is believed to be r=\r\neal because it has a substratum for its appearance. It\nappears and is for s=\r\nome time at least believed to be real. This distinction\nis very important f=\r\nor understanding the truth of the world, which is further\nelucidated in the=\r\n succeeding verses, in which Bhagavan=E2=80=99s teaching is given.\n\n433 Bot=\r\nh reality and unreality have to be stated in respect of the world,\nand here=\r\nin there is not the least contradiction. It is real because of the\nreality =\r\nof the substratum, and it is unreal, because of the superimposition\nof name=\r\ns and forms.\n\nAll the same, it must not be said that the world exists, as e=\r\nxplained below:\n\n434 Reality [of a soul] is conceded for the world, but it =\r\nwould not be\ncorrect to say that it exists. =E2=80=98Reality=E2=80=99 and =\r\n=E2=80=98existence=E2=80=99 are quite distinct.\nThat alone is said to be re=\r\nal which is real in its own right.\n\nThus in the language of the Vedanta the=\r\n term =E2=80=98reality=E2=80=99 applies strictly only\nto that which is real=\r\n in its own right, not to what has a borrowed reality,\nas explained in the =\r\nnext two verses.\n\n435 They say the world is pragmatically real, that what i=\r\ns seen in dream is\napparently real, and that the one without a second, name=\r\nly Brahman, is the\nsupreme reality. These grades of reality are pointless.\n=\r\n\nThese three degrees of reality are spoken of in order to enable weak minds=\r\n\nto receive the teaching in stages. But ultimately there is only one realit=\r\ny.\n\n436 Reality is always of one kind; there are no varieties or degrees of=\r\n\nreality. Hence, what is seen in dreams and what is seen in waking are both=\r\n\nequally unreal.\n\nThe necessity for accepting this teaching is explained ne=\r\nxt.\n\n437 The truth of the unreality of the world has here been taught to on=\r\ne who\nearnestly wants to attain the supreme state by pursuing the quest of =\r\nthe\nreal Self. How can one who believes the world to be real ever become ri=\r\nghtly\naware of the supreme reality, the Self?\n\n438 When the sun of right aw=\r\nareness dawns, what happens is only the\ncessation of the unreal appearing a=\r\ns real.The real Self is the sun of pure,\ninfinite consciousness. How can ig=\r\nnorance exist in its presence?\n\n439 If it is thought that ignorance exists,=\r\n then there is present for the\naspirant the question, =E2=80=98To whom is t=\r\nhe ignorance?=E2=80=99 If by that question the\ntruth of the Self is sought,=\r\n then the ignorant one and the ignorance both\nbecome extinct.\n\n440 Ignoranc=\r\ne is accepted in the teaching only as pertaining to the\nindividual jiva, wh=\r\no is just a figment of the imagination. It is not\naccepted as affecting the=\r\n real Self, because it is ever enlightened by its\nown nature, transcending =\r\nall the three states of life in the world.\n\n441 Just as the rope is never r=\r\nelated in any way to the unreal snake seen in\nit, so the real Self is never=\r\n related in space, time, or causality with the\nworld of variety, which is u=\r\nnreal.\n\n442 The saying that the Supreme Being is the cause of the world is =\r\nincorrect\nfrom the standpoint of the truth. The true cause of the world is =\r\nmaya, the\npower of the Supreme Being.\n\n443 In the sacred lore forms of the =\r\nBrahman are mentioned, one the seedless,\nand the other with seed. The seedl=\r\ness one is the transcendental Supreme\nBeing; the one with seed is God havin=\r\ng the might of maya.\n\nWhich of these two is the real one? The answer is as =\r\nfollows:\n\n444 The one Self, who is motionless by nature, appears to dance b=\r\necause of\nhis own power. But when that power merges into the motionless ess=\r\nence, there\nwill shine the one motionless Self as the sole reality.\n\nSo, th=\r\ne cause of variety is the power called maya. What about this maya?\n\n445 May=\r\na is stated to be the cause to those who ask what is the cause of the\nworld=\r\n, which really is unreal. From the standpoint of reality, both of\nthese, ma=\r\nya and its effect, are equally unreal.\n\n446 The following sorts of question=\r\ns are pointlessly asked =E2=80=98What is maya?\nWhat is ignorance? By whom a=\r\nnd how was the world originally created? How did\nthe individual soul come i=\r\nnto being?=E2=80=99\n\nThese questions have no basis and need no answer. The =\r\nfinal answer to all\nsuch questions is the awareness of the real Self in the=\r\n egoless state. In\nthat state these and other questions will not arise, bec=\r\nause the questioner,\nthe ego-mind, will not survive in that state.\n\nSource:=\r\n http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82 =\r\n =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87=\r\n  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=\r\n=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=\r\n=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0016e64f45e8ec251d04a0c57072\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n414 There is not even one flawless proof on the side of those th=\r\nat assert the plurality of souls.

This is taken from Bhagavan Sri Sankaracharya=E2=80=99s Tattvopadesa, i=\r\nn which it is the last verse.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;416 One should meditate upon the tru=\r\nth of non-duality with effort, but should not apply this truth in his [worl=\r\ndly] activities. [Also] one may think of non-duality in respect of all the =\r\nthree worlds, but should not imagine such [non-difference] with the Guru.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The reason is that theoretical knowledge of the truth of non-dualit=\r\ny does not avail to destroy the primary ignorance, so as to raise one to th=\r\ne egoless state, wherein wrong action would be impossible. So, till that st=\r\nate is won, the ego would be in command of actions, and this warning is the=\r\nrefore necessary.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Next the question is raised and dealt with as to=\r\n how the physical body and the world as a whole appear to the sage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n417 How can the world appear to the sage in the same way as it does to the =\r\nignorant? The Guru tells us in what way the world appears to the sage.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;The next verse gives the answer briefly, but also clearly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;418 =\r\nThe world, which to the ignorant appears as comprising the trinity of God, =\r\nthe jivas and the insentient objects, appears as the Self to the sage due t=\r\no the liquidation of the superimposed false appearance of the world.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;This is explained in detail as follows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;419 The sage who has atta=\r\nined his natural state, which is the supreme state, remains in his natural =\r\nfreedom. He is free from delusion and sees nothing other than the Self. How=\r\n then can he see anything unreal?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;420 Therefore the sage, establis=\r\nhed as he is in his natural state, the supreme state, would say that the bo=\r\ndy, appearing as =E2=80=98his=E2=80=99 body to others, and the world are re=\r\nal.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there is a world of difference in the meaning [of what=\r\n he says] because the superimposition does not appear [as real] to the sage=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Now it may be questioned whether the sage also, like us, does no=\r\nt need the discrimination between the real and the unreal. The answer is gi=\r\nven below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;421 The outlook of discrimination is enjoined [only] on t=\r\nhe aspirant for deliverance, not on him who has won deliverance. A confused=\r\n outlook is possible for the former, not for the latter.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The views=\r\n that the two have of the body is next explained and distinguished.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n422 The ignorant one, because of his confounding of the body with the Self,=\r\n thinks of himself as =E2=80=98with form=E2=80=99 and co-extensive with tha=\r\nt body. The sage is aware of the Self as infinite, formless being; this is =\r\nthe distinction in the meaning of what is said by these two.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span=\r\n style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;423 What is seen as =E2=80=98the body=E2=80=99 =\r\nby the ignorant appears to the sage only as the Self. He refers to it as =\r\n=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, ignoring the body-form through his right awareness.&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Next it is explained that the outlook of the sage towards the w=\r\norld is different from that of the ignorant one.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;424 Also, when th=\r\ne two say that the world is real, there is a difference in the meaning, tho=\r\nugh the words are the same. For the ignorant one, the reality is veiled by =\r\ndifferences, while to the sage, it appears as it really is.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;425 Un=\r\naware of the substratum of the world-appearance, seeing [only] the superimp=\r\nosed multitude of [inert] objects, and believing that this world of objects=\r\n is real in its own right, the ignorant one says, =E2=80=98The world is rea=\r\nl=E2=80=99.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;426 [On the other hand] for the sage there shines only=\r\n the substratum, which is the pure reality, nameless and formless. For him =\r\nthe superimposition does not appear as real. [That being the case], how can=\r\n he say that the world is unreal?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The contrast here is between the=\r\n substratum and the superimposed appearance. The ignorant one is unaware th=\r\nat there is a substratum. The sage is unaware of the superimposed appearanc=\r\ne.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;427 This world which, to the one whose eye is blinded by unawaren=\r\ness of his own real Self, conceals the Supreme Being, is, by [the power of]=\r\n that same Supreme Being, concealed to the one whose eye is purified by the=\r\n right awareness of that Self.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This is the meaning conveyed by the=\r\n opening verse of the Isa Upanishad.&lt;br&gt;Supposing that the sage does see th=\r\ne world of names and form. It is explained that the sage=E2=80=99s view is =\r\nunclouded by ignorance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;428 Just as one who has become wise to the t=\r\nruth of the mirage may again see the mirage without being deluded, so too t=\r\nhe sage, seeing this world, does not think of it as real, as does the ignor=\r\nant one.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Thus there is no comparison at all between the ignorant m=\r\nan and the sage. This is shown next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;429 This world is not real in t=\r\nhe sense in which it is believed to be real by the ignorant man. Ignorant o=\r\nnes do not understand the sense in which the world is seen [as real] by the=\r\n sage.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;430 That which appears to the ignorant ones as diversified =\r\nby a great many differences, as =E2=80=98forms=E2=80=99 and as =E2=80=98oth=\r\ner than the Self=E2=80=99, is, to the sage, only the Self, undifferentiated=\r\n and formless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is then explained that the teaching about the worl=\r\nd is two-fold, as unreal from one viewpoint and real from another viewpoint=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;431 It is not taught that the world is completely unreal. It is =\r\nnot [unreal] like the horn of man or a horse. If it were wholly unreal, it =\r\nwould not appear at all. But it does appear because of its confusion with i=\r\nts substratum, the reality.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The two kinds of unrealities are furth=\r\ner explained, for the sake of distinction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;432 The unreality that ha=\r\ns no substratum, such as the son of a barren woman and the like, does not a=\r\nppear at all. But the unreality which appears on a substratum, like the sna=\r\nke seen in a rope, appears as real.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The presence or absence of a s=\r\nubstratum makes all the difference. No one is misled into thinking that a b=\r\narren woman=E2=80=99s son has any existence, because he does not appear at =\r\nall. On the other hand, the snake not only appears, but it is believed to b=\r\ne real because it has a substratum for its appearance. It appears and is fo=\r\nr some time at least believed to be real. This distinction is very importan=\r\nt for understanding the truth of the world, which is further elucidated in =\r\nthe succeeding verses, in which Bhagavan=E2=80=99s teaching is given.&lt;br&gt;\n\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;433 Both reality and unreality have to be stated in respect of the worl=\r\nd, and herein there is not the least contradiction. It is real because of t=\r\nhe reality of the substratum, and it is unreal, because of the superimposit=\r\nion of names and forms.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;All the same, it must not be said that the=\r\n world exists, as explained below:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;434 Reality [of a soul] is conced=\r\ned for the world, but it would not be correct to say that it exists. =E2=80=\r\n=98Reality=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98existence=E2=80=99 are quite distinct. Tha=\r\nt alone is said to be real which is real in its own right.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Thus in=\r\n the language of the Vedanta the term =E2=80=98reality=E2=80=99 applies str=\r\nictly only to that which is real in its own right, not to what has a borrow=\r\ned reality, as explained in the next two verses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;435 They say the wo=\r\nrld is pragmatically real, that what is seen in dream is apparently real, a=\r\nnd that the one without a second, namely Brahman, is the supreme reality. T=\r\nhese grades of reality are pointless.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;These three degrees of reali=\r\nty are spoken of in order to enable weak minds to receive the teaching in s=\r\ntages. But ultimately there is only one reality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font=\r\n-weight:bold&quot;&gt;436 Reality is always of one kind; there are no varieties or =\r\ndegrees of reality. Hence, what is seen in dreams and what is seen in wakin=\r\ng are both equally unreal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The necessity for accepting this=\r\n teaching is explained next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;437 The truth of the unreality of the w=\r\norld has here been taught to one who earnestly wants to attain the supreme =\r\nstate by pursuing the quest of the real Self. How can one who believes the =\r\nworld to be real ever become rightly aware of the supreme reality, the Self=\r\n?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;438 When the sun of right awareness dawns, what happens is only =\r\nthe cessation of the unreal appearing as real.&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bo=\r\nld&quot;&gt;The real Self is the sun of pure, infinite consciousness.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0H=\r\now can ignorance exist in its presence?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;439 If it is thought that =\r\nignorance exists, then there is present for the aspirant the question, =E2=\r\n=80=98To whom is the ignorance?=E2=80=99 If by that question the truth of t=\r\nhe Self is sought, then the ignorant one and the ignorance both become exti=\r\nnct.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;440 Ignorance is accepted in the teaching only as pertaining =\r\nto the individual jiva, who is just a figment of the imagination. It is not=\r\n accepted as affecting the real Self, because it is ever enlightened by its=\r\n own nature, transcending all the three states of life in the world.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;441 Just as the rope is never related in any way to the unreal snake see=\r\nn in it, so the real Self is never related in space, time, or causality wit=\r\nh the world of variety, which is unreal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;442 The saying that the Sup=\r\nreme Being is the cause of the world is incorrect from the standpoint of th=\r\ne truth. The true cause of the world is maya, the power of the Supreme Bein=\r\ng.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;443 In the sacred lore forms of the Brahman are mentioned, one =\r\nthe seedless, and the other with seed. The seedless one is the transcendent=\r\nal Supreme Being; the one with seed is God having the might of maya.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;Which of these two is the real one? The answer is as follows:&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;444=\r\n The one Self, who is motionless by nature, appears to dance because of his=\r\n own power. But when that power merges into the motionless essence, there w=\r\nill shine the one motionless Self as the sole reality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, the cause=\r\n of variety is the power called maya. What about this maya?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;445 Ma=\r\nya is stated to be the cause to those who ask what is the cause of the worl=\r\nd, which really is unreal. From the standpoint of reality, both of these, m=\r\naya and its effect, are equally unreal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:b=\r\nold&quot;&gt;446 The following sorts of questions are pointlessly asked =E2=80=98Wh=\r\nat is maya? What is ignorance? By whom and how was the world originally cre=\r\nated? How did the individual soul come into being?=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;These =\r\nquestions have no basis and need no answer. The final answer to all such qu=\r\nestions is the awareness of the real Self in the egoless state. In that sta=\r\nte these and other questions will not arise, because the questioner, the eg=\r\no-mind, will not survive in that state.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font=\r\n-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/r=\r\npv_intro.shtml&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_int=\r\nro.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:both;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin=\r\n-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=\r\n=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:87%;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;mar=\r\ngin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82=C2=A0 =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B=C2=A0 =E0=B0=AD=E0=\r\n=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=\r\n=80=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF=C2=A0=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=C2=\r\n=A0 =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\r\n--0016e64f45e8ec251d04a0c57072--\r\n\n"}}
