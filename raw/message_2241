For example, in this thread,\n&gt; between the words &quot;God-realiz=\r\ned&quot; and &quot;self-realized&quot;, Shankaracharya was\n&gt; labelled as &quot;self-realized&quot;. =\r\nWe often have such theoretical discussions without\n&gt; understanding the term=\r\ns involved (I am more guilty of this than most). For me,\n&gt; this book helped=\r\n clarify some of these terms and concepts, from a learned\n&gt; jagadguru who h=\r\nad directly experienced.\n&gt; \n&gt; Based on my reading, the path to spirituality=\r\n requires destroying the\n&gt; ego. I don&#39;t\n&gt; think that it is possible for me =\r\nto reduce my ego without both bhakti\n&gt; to Ishwara\n&gt; and vicAra as part of t=\r\nhe picture.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have to surrender to a higher power in order to reduce m=\r\ny ego. But then my ego\n&gt; shows up elsewhere and becomes happy that I am a g=\r\nood bhakta that is pleasing\n&gt; Ishwara. Then I have to realize that Ishwara =\r\nisn&#39;t pleased by my\n&gt; action or inaction.\n&gt; And then, without a higher powe=\r\nr in the picture, the original ego\n&gt; resurfaces. Hence,\n&gt; as far as the pro=\r\ncess is concerned, I believe that bhakti and vicAra\n&gt; go hand in hand.\n&gt; Us=\r\ning an illustration from the Yoga-Vasishtha, it is like the two\n&gt; wings of =\r\na bird that\n&gt; wants to fly.\n&gt; \n&gt; I understood the question as asking about =\r\nself-realization (through vicAra) and\n&gt; God-realization (through bhakti). F=\r\nrom my perspective, the path and desired\n&gt; result are really the same, rega=\r\nrdless of how they are labelled. Looking back,\n&gt; reading this book helped f=\r\norm my opinion, and I thought that others might find\n&gt; the book to be equal=\r\nly revealing.\n&gt; \n&gt; bhavadiiyaH,\n&gt; \n&gt;       ajit\n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, Aug 7, 2009 at=\r\n 5:48 AM, Jyotisa Shisya&lt;achyutagaddi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ajit,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Always refreshing to read your post...this one I could not resist replying=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; to!
