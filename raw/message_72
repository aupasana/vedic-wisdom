I am glad to know of your activities.\n\nIf you throw a spark of fire onto wet grass, nothing will happen. But, if \nyou throw a spark of fire onto dry grass, the whole thing will burn. There \nare souls out there who are ready to burn their karmas in spiritual sadhana \nand who need just a spark. If YOU happen to be the nimitta for throwing a \nspark at them, you will be so fortunate. The only thing is that it is \ndifficult to tell such souls apart from others. So you can just try without \nany expectations.\n\nOne of my friends finished reading &quot;Ramakrishna and His Disciples&quot; by \nChristopher Isherwood. It inspired him and changed him a lot and now he is \nreading the &quot;Gospel of Ramakrishna&quot;. Isherwood&#39;s book is a novel-like book \nwith a beautiful style. I can recommend that book as a precursor to the \ngospel.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nHomam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, June 23, 2007 7:58 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: vedic wisdom for learners\n\n\n&gt; Narsimha Garu,\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaskaar!!\n&gt;\n&gt; you wrote :\n&gt; &quot;I particularly recommend &quot;Gospel of Ramakrishna&quot;. Ramakrishna\n&gt; Parahamahamsa was a great master who taught the highest knowledge in\n&gt; simplest terms to all kinds of people. Read his teachings with an\n&gt; open mind, understand them and try to follow them.\n&gt; &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; How true it is !! Thakur&#39;s Kathamruta is one of the best spiritual\n&gt; help ever.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am recommending & even passing books such as Gospel of Ramkrishna,\n&gt; Autobiography of a yogi, Yoga Vasishtha, Spirit of Inquiry, Upansihad\n&gt; Nu Amrut (in Gujarati) to few people whom i find even a little bit of\n&gt; bit of inclination so that they get a effective trigger of Spiritual\n&gt; quest. i gives me lot of joy if somebody in Dubai (Soaked in Maya)\n&gt; reads such a book and i become a nimitta for that.\n&gt;\n&gt; Warm regards after a long time\n&gt;\n&gt; Utpal\n\n\n"}}
