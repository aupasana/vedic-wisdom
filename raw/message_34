But didn&#39;t get any reply.\n\nCouple of weeks before I down loaded Ganapati homam manual and mp3 version from your web site. I found it very useful. Thanks for the same. Is it possible for you to put one such manual for Rudrabishekam also.\n\nIam doing Rudrabishekam daily for quite some years and want to check with you if iam doing it in right way or not. What I do is recite rudram and chamakam, and do abishekam to shiv linga. End up with mantra pushpam\n\nPlease advise.\n\nThanks. Rgds\nAnand\n  \n\n\n"}}
