Karma, B=\r\nhakti,         Jnana, and Raja Yoga will all\ncome to one who follows them w=\r\nhole-heartedly. They         are the\nunfailing keys to quick and effective =\r\ndevelopment and culture of the\nphysical,         mental, moral and spiritua=\r\nl self of man.\n\n    1.            Brahmamuhurta\nGet up at 4 a.m. daily. Thi=\r\ns is Brahmamuhurta which is extremely\nfavourable for Sadhana. Do all       =\r\n      your morning spiritual\nSadhana during this period from 4 a.m. to 6:30=\r\n or 7 a.m.            \nSuch Sadhana gives quick and maximum progress.\n\n    =\r\n2.            Asana\nSit on Padmasana (lotus pose), Siddhasana (adept&#39;s pose=\r\n) or Sukhasana\n(any pose you like) for             your Japa and meditation=\r\n for half an\nhour, facing east or north. Increase the             period gr=\r\nadually to\nthree hours. Practice Sirshasana (headstand) and Sarvangasana\n(s=\r\nhoulderstand) for maintenance of health and Brahmacharya. Take light\nphysic=\r\nal             exercises as walking, etc., regularly. Do twenty\nrounds of e=\r\nasy, comfortable             Pranayama (breathing exercises).\nDo not strain=\r\n yourself while doing Pranayama.\n\n    3.            Japa\nYou can repeat any=\r\n Mantra (sacred syllable), such as pure Om or Om Namo\nNarayanaya, Sri      =\r\n       Ram, Sita Ram, Sri Ram Jaya Ram Jaya Jaya\nRam, Om Namah Sivaya, Om N=\r\namo Bhagavate             Vasudevaya, Om\nSaravanabhavaya Namah, Hari Om, or=\r\n  Gayatri (a sacred             Vedic\nMantra), according to your taste or i=\r\nnclination, from 108 times to\n21,600             times daily. Devotees of C=\r\nhrist may repeat the name\nJesus or Hail             Mary, Mother of Jesus. =\r\nParsis, Sikhs and\nMuslims may select a name or Mantra             from the =\r\nZend Avesta,\nGranth Sahib or Koran respectively.\n\n    4.            DIETETI=\r\nC DISCIPLINE\nTake Sattvic food. Give up chillies, tamarind, garlic, onion, =\r\nsour\narticles, oil, mustard, asafoetida.             Observe moderation in\n=\r\ndiet (Mitahara). Do not overload the stomach. Give up             those\nthi=\r\nngs which the mind likes best for a fortnight once or twice in a\nyear.     =\r\n        Eat simple food. Milk and fruits help concentration.\nTake food as m=\r\nedicine to             keep the life going. Eating for\nenjoyment is a sin. =\r\nGive up salt and sugar for             a week or a\nfortnight. You must be a=\r\nble to live on rice, dhal and bread without\nany pickle. Do not ask for extr=\r\na salt for dhal, and sugar for tea,\ncoffee and             milk. People tak=\r\ning a non-vegetaraian diet should\ntry their best to gradually             g=\r\nive up flesh-eating as\ncompletely as possible. They will be immensely benef=\r\nited.\n\n    5.            MEDITATION\nHave a separate meditation room under l=\r\nock and key. If this is not\npossible then a corner of             the room =\r\nshould be set apart with\na small cloth screen or curtain drawn across.     =\r\n        Keep the room\nspotlessly clean.\n\n    6.            SVADHYAYA\n  [Swa=\r\nmi Sivananda at his desk] Study systematically the Gita, Ramayana,\nBhagavat=\r\nam, Vishnu-Sahasranama, Lalita-Sahasranama, Adityahridaya,\nUpanishads, Yoga=\r\n Vasishta, Bible, Imitation of Christ, Zend Quran, the\nTripitakas,         =\r\n    the Granth Sahib and other religious books from\nhalf an hour to one hou=\r\nr             daily, and have Suddha Vichara\n(pure thoughts).\n\n    7.      =\r\n      ELEVATE THE MIND\nLearn by heart some prayer - Slokas (prayer verses),=\r\n Stotras (hymns) and\nrepeat them as soon as             you sit in the Asan=\r\na before starting\nJapa or meditation. This will elevate the             min=\r\nd quickly.\n\n    8.            BRAHMACHARYA\nPreserve the vital force (Veerya=\r\n (seminal energy)) very, very carefully.\nVeerya is God in motion           =\r\n  or manifestation (Vibhuti). Veerya\nis all power. Veerya is all money. Vee=\r\nrya             is the essence of\nlife, thought and intelligence. This inst=\r\nruction is not for            \nbachelors only. Householders also must follo=\r\nw it as far as possible.\nThey must             be extremely moderate in the=\r\nir marital connections\nwith their spouse. This is             very importan=\r\nt.\n\n    9.            CHARITY\nDo charity regularly, every month, or even da=\r\nily according to your\nmeans. Never fail in this item.             If necess=\r\nary forego some\npersonal wants but keep up this charity regularly.\n\n   10. =\r\n           HAVE SATSANG\nGive up bad company, smoking, meat and alcoholic li=\r\nquors entirely. Have\nconstant Satsang (association             with holy pe=\r\nople). Do not\ndevelop any evil habits. Deliberately exert to develop       =\r\n     \npositive virtuous qualities.\n\n   11.            FAST\nFast on Ekadasi =\r\n(11th day of the Hindu lunar fortnight) or live on milk\nand fruits only. Ch=\r\nristians             must fast on alternate Sundays,\nMuslims on alternate F=\r\nridays, and Parsis on             a suitable day\nevery fortnight.\n\n   12.  =\r\n          JAPA MALA\nHave a Japa Mala (rosary) around your neck or in your p=\r\nocket or\nunderneath your pillow at night.             This will remind you =\r\nof\nGod. Twirl the beads during your leisure. You should             repeat\n=\r\nthe Name at all times, whatever task you may be engaged in.\n\n   13.        =\r\n    OBSERVE MOUNA\nObserve Mouna (vow of silence) for a couple of hours dail=\r\ny. Do not make\ngestures and inarticulate             noises during the peri=\r\nod of\nsilence.\n\n   14.            DISCIPLINE OF SPEECH\nSpeak the truth at a=\r\nll cost. Speak a little. Speak sweetly. Always utter\nencouraging words.    =\r\n         Never condemn, criticize or discourage.\nDo not raise your voice an=\r\nd shout at             little children or\nsubordinates.\n\n   15.            =\r\nBE CONTENT\nReduce your wants. If you have four shirts, reduce the number to=\r\n three\nor two. Lead a happy, contented             life. Avoid unnecessary\n=\r\nworry. Be mentally detached. Have plain living and high            \nthinkin=\r\ng. Think of those who do not possess even one-tenth of what you\nhave.      =\r\n       Share with others.\n\n   16.            PRACTICE LOVE\nNever hurt anybo=\r\ndy. Ahimsa Paramo Dharmah (Non-injury is the highest\nvirtue). Control anger=\r\n             by love, Kshama (forgiveness) and\nDaya (compassion). Serve the=\r\n sick and the             poor with love and\naffection. This is service of =\r\nGod.\n\n   17.            BE SELF RELIANT\nDo not depend upon servants. Self-r=\r\neliance is the highest of all\nvirtues.\n\n   18.            HAVE SELF-ANALYSI=\r\nS\nThink of the mistakes you have committed during the course of the day,\nju=\r\nst before retiring to bed             (self-analysis). Keep a daily\nspiritu=\r\nal diary and self-correction register as             Benjamin\nFranklin did.=\r\n Maintain a daily routine and resolve-form. Do not brood\nover past mistakes=\r\n.\n\n   19.            DO YOUR DUTY\nRemember that death is awaiting you at ev=\r\nery moment. Never fail to\nfulfil your duties. Have pure             conduct=\r\n (Sadachara).\n\n   20.            REMEMBER GOD\nThink of God as soon as you w=\r\nake up and just before you go to sleep, and\nat all other times             =\r\nwhether engaged in any work or not.\nRepeat His Name always. Surrender yours=\r\nelf             completely to God\n(Saranagati).\n\n\nThis is the essence of al=\r\nl spiritual Sadhana. It will lead you to\nliberation. All         these spir=\r\nitual canons must be rigidly observed.\nYou must not give any leniency      =\r\n   to the mind.\n\n\r\n--4-3674909047-1081001978=:9\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;instructions&quot; class=3D&quot;tab_content&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;h3&gt;20 Spiritual Inst=\r\nructions&lt;/h3&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;by Sri Swami Sivananda&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=3D&quot;http=\r\n://www.sivananda.org/images/master2.jpg&quot; class=3D&quot;content_right&quot; alt=3D&quot;Swa=\r\nmi Sivananda&quot; width=3D&quot;387&quot; height=3D&quot;500&quot;&gt;These twenty instructions contai=\r\nn the very essence of all Yoga Sadhana.

Do no=\r\nt raise your voice and shout at\n            little children or subordinates=\r\n.&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;h4&gt;BE CONTENT&lt;/h4&gt;\n          &lt;p&gt;Reduce y=\r\nour wants. If you have four shirts, reduce the number to three or two. Lead=\r\n a happy, contented\n            life. Avoid unnecessary worry. Be mentally =\r\ndetached. Have plain living and high\n            thinking. Think of those w=\r\nho do not possess even one-tenth of what you have.\n            Share with o=\r\nthers.&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;h4&gt;PRACTICE LOVE&lt;/h4&gt;\n          &lt;p&gt;=\r\nNever hurt anybody. &lt;i&gt;Ahimsa Paramo Dharmah&lt;/i&gt; (Non-injury is the highest=\r\n virtue). Control anger\n            by love, Kshama (forgiveness) and Daya =\r\n(compassion). Serve the sick and the\n            poor with love and affecti=\r\non. This is service of God.&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;h4&gt;BE SELF REL=\r\nIANT&lt;/h4&gt;\n          &lt;p&gt;Do not depend upon servants. Self-reliance is the hi=\r\nghest of all virtues.&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;h4&gt;HAVE SELF-ANALYSI=\r\nS&lt;/h4&gt;\n          &lt;p&gt;Think of the mistakes you have committed during the cou=\r\nrse of the day, just before retiring to bed\n            (self-analysis). Ke=\r\nep a daily spiritual diary and self-correction register as\n            Benj=\r\namin Franklin did. Maintain a daily routine and resolve-form. Do not brood\n=\r\n            over past mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;h4&gt;DO YOUR=\r\n DUTY&lt;/h4&gt;\n          &lt;p&gt;Remember that death is awaiting you at every moment=\r\n. Never fail to fulfil your duties. Have pure\n            conduct (Sadachar=\r\na).&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER GOD&lt;/h4&gt;\n          &lt;p&gt;Thin=\r\nk of God as soon as you wake up and just before you go to sleep, and at all=\r\n other times\n            whether engaged in any work or not. Repeat His Nam=\r\ne always. Surrender yourself\n            completely to God (Saranagati).&lt;/p=\r\n&gt;\n        &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;This is the essence of all spiritual Sadhana.=\r\n It will lead you to liberation. All\n        these spiritual canons must be=\r\n rigidly observed. You must not give any leniency\n        to the mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n=\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--4-3674909047-1081001978=:9--\r\n\n"}}
