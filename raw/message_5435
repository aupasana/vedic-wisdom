Hinduism is a religion that is=\r\n designed by its very nature to be open and welcoming to all of the world&#39;s=\r\n diverse people, regardless of their individual ethnicity, race, caste or l=\r\nanguage. This global reality of Hinduism is clearly reflected in the origin=\r\nal Sanskrit terms found within its own Vedic scriptures that are used to de=\r\nscribe the religion. Hinduism is historically referred to in the scriptures=\r\n as Sanatana Dharma, the &quot;Eternal Natural Way&quot;; Vishva Dharma, the &quot;Univers=\r\nal Way&quot;; and Vaidika Dharma, the &quot;Way of Truth&quot;, among many other self-refe=\r\nrenced appellations.\n\nHinduism was always in reality so much more than mere=\r\nly the &quot;religion of India&quot;. Throughout its history, Hinduism has always bee=\r\nn a trans-geographical spiritual-cultural matrix, a universal spiritual cul=\r\nture designed to be practiced by all the people of the Earth. This fact is =\r\nattested to by the history of Sanatana Dharma. Even as recently as 2500 yea=\r\nrs ago, the Hindu sphere of direct cultural influence was not limited in an=\r\ny way to only India, but ranged over at least two-thirds of Asia. In the pr=\r\ne-Buddhist era, the entire territory ranging from much of ancient Persia (t=\r\noday&#39;s Iran), Central Asia and Afghanistan in the West; extending into the =\r\nSouth Asian region that today includes such nations as India, Pakistan, Nep=\r\nal, Bhutan, Tibet, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh; and including the South-East =\r\nAsian nations of Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indone=\r\nsia, and much of south China and the Philippines were predominantly Hindu s=\r\ntates.\n\nOn a more peripheral scale, centuries of scholarly research have re=\r\npeatedly demonstrated that Hindu and Dharmic influences extended also to mu=\r\nch of ancient Celtic, Germanic, Greco-Roman, Hittite, Mesopotamian and pre-=\r\nColumbian cultures as well, to name only a few. Indeed, in the ancient worl=\r\nd scene of pre-Abrahamic history especially, it could be justifiably argued=\r\n that the Dharmic way of living and thinking served as the paradigmatic fou=\r\nndation of almost every important culture and civilization on earth.  \n\nThe=\r\n boundless breadth and expansive depth of Hinduism is found not only extern=\r\nally in its historically global reach and universal influence, but also int=\r\nernally in its multiple and well-developed arts and sciences. For unlike an=\r\ny other spiritual world-view in existence, there is no aspect of the human =\r\nexperience - from the aesthetic, literary, scientific, economic, medical an=\r\nd political realms, to those of philosophy, metaphysics, psychology and ult=\r\nimate mystical transcendence - that Hinduism does not address directly, sys=\r\ntematically and conclusively. It is, in fact, especially through its arts a=\r\nnd sciences that we now see Hinduism once again beginning to spread its ben=\r\nevolent influence throughout the entire world after a two-thousand year per=\r\niod of forced steady decline.\n\nThroughout the entire globe, in almost every=\r\n nation on earth, from Europe and the Americas, to the former Soviet Union,=\r\n East Asia and even the Middle East, we have witnessed a virtual explosion =\r\nin the last few decades alone of multiple tens of millions of the Earth&#39;s d=\r\niverse inhabitants enthusiastically embracing such core Hindu practices as =\r\nYoga, ayurveda, jyotisha, mantra meditation, vastu, chakra work, vegetarian=\r\nism and natural healing, as well as deeply appreciating overtly Hindu forms=\r\n of philosophy, music, foods and art. As Dr. Frawley himself states in this=\r\n work, &quot;Hinduism is once more emerging in its full scope as Sanatana Dharma=\r\n, a universal and eternal tradition of truth, knowledge and consciousness t=\r\nhat encompasses all life and is relevant to all creatures - which is its or=\r\niginal formulation.&quot; (pg. 6)\n\nIndeed, what is even more revealing about the=\r\n nature of the current Hindu resurgence is the fact that we now have millio=\r\nns of non-Indians globally who consciously identify Hinduism as their chose=\r\nn religion; and who, when asked what their religion is, will verbally asser=\r\nt with pride: &quot;I am a Hindu!&quot; Thus, what began in its original inception as=\r\n a Vishva Dharma - a universal spiritual path - has now come full circle to=\r\n become a truly world religion once again. As the entire world continues to=\r\n adopt Hindu practices at lightning speed, it is now safe to say that the v=\r\nast global influence of Hinduism lay not only in the historical past, but a=\r\ns an ever-increasing future reality. The Vedic world-view can no longer be =\r\nseen as something that is to be relegated to an archaic past, and of intere=\r\nst only to a hand-full of self-serving academicians, scholars and &quot;Indologi=\r\nsts&quot; scrambling to make a name for themselves in their attempt to lay intel=\r\nlectual claim to the corpse of a supposedly dead culture. Rather, Sanatana =\r\nDharma is a living and dynamic spiritual phenomenon. Hinduism does not repr=\r\nesent the past. It is the future. \n\nThe present work by Dr. David Frawley (=\r\nSri Vamadeva Shastri) serves in itself as a further important piece of evid=\r\nence documenting the revived universal scope of the Hindu world-view. Writt=\r\nen by a well-respected contemporary Yogi, Vaidya, Veda-Acharya and Hindu sc=\r\nholar of specifically Western origin, &quot;Universal Hinduism: Towards a New Vi=\r\nsion of Sanatana Dharma&quot; is a crucially relevant and important work that ne=\r\neds to be, not merely read in a cursory manner, but deeply analyzed by all =\r\nserious Hindu practitioners, activists, gurus and leaders. In this work, Dr=\r\n. Frawley not only documents the many positive influences that the Hindu wo=\r\nrld-view continues to have upon the entire world, but more, he explains in =\r\nbrilliant fashion why the re-universalization of Hindu Dharma is both natur=\r\nal to the religion&#39;s very essence, and thus an inevitable development.\n\nLik=\r\ne many of Dr. Frawley&#39;s previously published, highly innovative works, &quot;Uni=\r\nversal Hinduism&quot; is a groundbreaking book in many respects. For this work l=\r\nays out like no other book has been capable of to date both 1) an expositio=\r\nn of the natural universality of Hinduism and its fast growing appeal to mi=\r\nllions of non-Hindus throughout the globe, as well as 2) a blueprint for ho=\r\nw to ensure that Hinduism continues to make its transition from a religion =\r\nthat experienced a thousand years of persecution to now again becoming a po=\r\nwerful world religion in a manner that will be most conducive for its healt=\r\nhy continued growth. This book is nothing less than a clear manifesto for e=\r\nnsuring the rightful place of Sanatana Dharma as a global force for good in=\r\n the 21st Century. The number and scope of topics that Dr. Frawley brillian=\r\ntly addresses in this work are too numerous to address deeply in a brief pr=\r\nefatory exercise as mine. I do, however, wish to highlight a few topics tha=\r\nt I think are especially crucial.\n\nIn outlining the universal nature of Hin=\r\nduism, Dr. Frawley very expertly avoids the common pitfall perpetrated by a=\r\nll too many Hindu leaders of reducing Hindu universalism to what I have pre=\r\nviously termed &quot;Radical Universalism&quot;. As the author ably points out, the f=\r\nact that Hinduism is a religion that is universal in nature and is open to =\r\nbeing practiced and to full adoption by all human beings is in no way to be=\r\n equated with the false notion that all religious and spiritual paths are i=\r\nndistinguishable from one another. Hinduism does not teach that all religio=\r\nns are the same. Dr. Frawly correctly reminds us that Sanatana Dharma is it=\r\ns own unique and systematized spiritual tradition that contains within its =\r\ninherent being a distinctive sense of spiritual/cultural identity, history =\r\nand purpose. As Dr. Frawley so well states the problem in the first chapter=\r\n of this work:\n\n&quot;Hindu universalism is not a radical universalism that equa=\r\ntes religions as they are and removes any differentiation between religious=\r\n teachings and doctrines. Hindu universalism reflects an understanding of u=\r\nniversal law that cannot be made subordinate to religious dogmas, beliefs, =\r\nfaiths or institutions. Hindu universalism leads us to a rigorous science o=\r\nf consciousness, not simply to an attempt to make all religious doctrines t=\r\nhe same.&quot; (pg. 48)\n\nAs Sanatana Dharma currently finds itself in its on-goi=\r\nng attempt to interface its concerns with eternality vis-=E0-vis the presen=\r\nt fact of modernity, it must both re-embrace its universal relevance for al=\r\nl of the Earth&#39;s diverse human beings, while simultaneously retaining its o=\r\nwn unique identity. Hinduism is not Christianity, nor is it Islam, Buddhism=\r\n or Taoism. Hinduism is Sanatana Dharma: The Eternal Natural Way. It is onl=\r\ny in rejecting the extreme notion of Radical Universalism, and asserting in=\r\nstead the universal applicability of Dharma in everyday life, that the futu=\r\nre of Hinduism will remain secure, strong and relevant to the entire world.=\r\n\n\nUp until the appearance of this present work by Dr. Frawley, very few Hin=\r\ndu writers had written about the overtly political implications of Dharma a=\r\ns instantiated in contemporary political and governance issues. Two of the =\r\nfew exceptions to this rule were the brilliant Hindu scholars and writers S=\r\nri Ram Swarup and Sri Sitaram Goel. While many knowledgeable Hindus had alw=\r\nays recognized that Dharma is not merely a spiritual path, but is also an i=\r\ndeological world-view that has direct insights to offer in the realms of po=\r\nlitics, economics and social sciences, not many had been able to envision p=\r\nrecisely what an ideology of Dharma politics would entail or even look like=\r\n. In recognizing that Sanatana Dharma now finds itself once again in a posi=\r\ntion to assert itself as a growing global force for future spiritual, polit=\r\nical, economic and cultural change, Dr. Frawley outlines throughout this bo=\r\nok precisely what a healthy politically-engaged Hinduism will look like, as=\r\n well as what it must emphasize and seek to accomplish, in overt political =\r\nterms. Part three of Dr. Frawley&#39;s work is especially innovative and crucia=\r\nlly relevant in this regard.\n\nUp till now, the political expression of Hind=\r\nuism has been relegated to no more than a confused and not wholly successfu=\r\nl sense of Indian nationalism, or &quot;Hindu Nationalism&quot;, as its polemically-d=\r\nriven critics in academia and the media have repeatedly termed it. In keepi=\r\nng with the universal nature and relevance of Sanatana Dharma, however, Dr.=\r\n Frawley correctly asserts that confining Hinduism to a mere parochial sens=\r\ne of Indian or Hindu nationalism is ultimately both politically shortsighte=\r\nd and not in keeping with the eternal mandate that Hinduism has to potentia=\r\nlly inform and reform all political discourse universally. Dharma politics,=\r\n like the eternal path of Sanatana Dharma that forms its very basis, cannot=\r\n be relegated only to the current political scene in contemporary India, bu=\r\nt must offer a vision of a better world for all human beings who inhabit ou=\r\nr increasingly shrinking planet. Dharma is not a genetically circumscribed =\r\nrace or a nationality, but is universal Truth. Similarly, Dharma politics i=\r\ns necessarily open to all and has practical answers to offer all people, re=\r\ngardless of race, nationality or even religious affiliation.\n\nIn Dr. Frawle=\r\ny&#39;s vision of what such a universal, Dharma-based political ideology seeks,=\r\n he states: &quot;To create a society in harmony with nature and with peace amon=\r\ng all people, there must first be a dharmic foundation in order to uphold i=\r\nt...we need a view of human civilization in harmony with all life...&quot;. (pg.=\r\n 173) The author then clearly states what some of the important issues are =\r\nthat Dharma directly addresses. Thus, Dr. Frawley asserts, Hinduism can and=\r\n must provide the philosophical foundation of not merely a narrowly envisio=\r\nned Indian nationalism, but a universally applicable Dharma Nationalism tha=\r\nt all human beings can employ in their respective nation-states, communitie=\r\ns and villages to make our world a more peaceful, compassionate and civiliz=\r\ned place. While &quot;Universal Hinduism&quot; is designed to be neither an exclusive=\r\n exposition on Dharma political science per se, nor purely a political mani=\r\nfesto, it does cover previously unchartered ground in this regard, and I lo=\r\nok forward to seeing Dr. Frawley write in an even more concentrated way on =\r\nthis precise topic in the future. \n\nThe fact that Dr. Frawley&#39;s &quot;Universal =\r\nHinduism: Towards a New Vision of Sanatana Dharma&quot; is destined to become an=\r\n instant classic in modern Hindu literature is both a given and a highly ap=\r\npropriate fact in my mind. It is a brilliant work. In it, Dr. Frawley provi=\r\ndes the tools necessary to reformulate the eternal message of Hinduism, to =\r\ncommunicate that message in until now untapped avenues of outreach, and to =\r\nthus potentially reposition Hinduism on the world stage as the noble and ke=\r\nenly relevant global religion that it always has been. Dr. David Frawley - =\r\nSri Veda-Acharya Vamadeva Shastri - may have chosen to be physically born i=\r\nn a White American, formerly Christian, body in this lifetime. But I assure=\r\n the reader that his inner self is nothing less than one of Dharma&#39;s most c=\r\nherished children, born in our day to elucidate the way of Hindu Dharma for=\r\n all the world to better understand and appreciate.\n\n\nSri Dharma Pravartaka=\r\n Acharya\n(Dr. Frank Morales, Ph.D.)\nInternational Sanatana Dharma Society\nT=\r\nhe Center for Dharma Studies\nOmaha, Nebraska, USA\nMarch 31, 2010\n\n\nOrder th=\r\nis important new book today:\n\nhttp://www.dharmacentral.com/forum/content.ph=\r\np?78-Universal-Hinduism\n\n\n\nPlease Forward\n\n\n\n"}}
