Even a very powerful mantra can be offered in ho=\r\nmam. On the Vedic side, Rudra namakam and Gayatri mantra are very very powe=\r\nrful mantras and they are offered in homam. On the Tantrik side, Pratyangir=\r\na mantra, Mahasudarsana mantra, Paashupata mantra etc are very very powerfu=\r\nl astra mantras and they are offered in homam. As these examples show, even=\r\n very powerful mantras can be offered in fire for amplification.\n \n*       =\r\n *        *\n \nThe power of powerful mantras is a mirage for most people. Th=\r\ne experience given by a mantra and the internal/external results brought by=\r\n a mantra vary from mantra to mantra. But, even with a very powerful mantra=\r\n, one needs to be ready for the mantra to actually work.\n \nWhen one is able=\r\n to perfectly control the mind and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thought=\r\ns but the mantra reverberating in the mind constantly), then one experience=\r\ns the mantra. This perfect absorption of self-awareness in the mantra then =\r\ncauses internal changes by the flow of energy internally in specific ways (=\r\nspecific to the mantra) and that causes corresponding external changes in t=\r\nhe universe and corresponding karmic interactions between various objects. =\r\n\n \nThere may be thousands of paths to climb a mountain. Each path takes one=\r\n to a different spot atop the mountain. The view one has from the top may b=\r\ne different accordingly. One view may be more breathtaking and amazing than=\r\n another. However, one taking a path leading to a breathtaking view and one=\r\n taking a path leading to a normal view both have to struggle on their path=\r\ns and reach the top despite obstacles. Some paths may be slightly shorter, =\r\nbut none is too easy. All paths are difficult to walk, but some result in a=\r\n more breathtaking view than the others.\n \nSimilarly, one chanting a &quot;power=\r\nful mantra&quot; and a &quot;normal mantra&quot; will both have to put in effort and overc=\r\nome the weaknesses and get control over mind. The power of the powerful man=\r\ntra refers to a more powerful experience after one succeeds with the mantra=\r\n (more breathtaking scenery on reaching the mountain top). It is not correc=\r\nt to think that things will happen automatically and easily because one if =\r\nchanting a powerful mantra 11 (or whatever) times.\n \n*        *        *\n \n=\r\nComing back to Rajarshi&#39;s question, I do not recommend homam with Kunjika s=\r\ntotra. Kunjika stotra is a coded stotra containing several mantras in coded=\r\n form. It is not what it may seem to be. It is for a reason that Shiva tell=\r\ns Parvati that this prayer should be hidden like one&#39;s privates. It is weir=\r\nd that we are discussing such a secretive mantra on a public forum. It is a=\r\n collection of powerful mantras for specific prayogas that would be conside=\r\nred raajasik/taamasik unless a realized soul without attachment to the acti=\r\nons is acting them out as an instrument of the Divine.\n \nI see no point in =\r\nwanting to do homam with it. If you are meant to do a homam with Kunjika st=\r\notra to stop the army of a country in their tracks or kill someone or delud=\r\ne someone etc and if you are detached enough to carry it off successfully, =\r\nthen you will be given an opportunity by nature to learn it and do it. Othe=\r\nrwise, why even try?\n \nMy advice is to drop the idea of doing a homam with =\r\nKunjika stotra. Just stick to saptashati (700 verses). If that is too long =\r\nfor you, try saptashloki (7 verses) or just the 4th chapter or just the 11t=\r\nh chapter. Another option is to do a homam with just the moola mantra (nava=\r\nakshari).\n \nIf one can pronounce the 8 verses of Devi sooktam well, a homam=\r\n with Devi sooktam is a great idea too.\n \n*        *        *\n \nA few mails=\r\n from the last couple of weeks are pending reply. I am aware of it and will=\r\n try to catch up. I am very busy with various things right now. Please do n=\r\not resend the mails. If I have something to say, I will send a reply in the=\r\n next 10 days.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree=\r\n Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish sof=\r\ntware (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) =\r\nwebsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n--------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------- \n \n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;m540i9=\r\n8&quot; &lt;m540i98@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, Feb=\r\nruary 22, 2009 10:29 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Question on Kunjika Sto=\r\ntra\n\n&gt; Namaste\n&gt; \n&gt; Kunjika Shotram is a very powerful one, why do homan of=\r\n it, atleast I \n&gt; have never heard anybody doing it but I am very ignonart =\r\ntoo, instead \n&gt; there is a Durga Sapta Slokas that may be more easier and l=\r\nighter.\n&gt; \n&gt; Only one Shri agaram bagaram baba (I am sure my spellings are =\r\nwrong) a \n&gt; disciple of swami muktananda has indicated that one can chant f=\r\nor 11 \n&gt; times daily and that is enough.\n&gt; \n&gt; He seemed to be very realized=\r\n and lived near Nasik, someone has written \n&gt; his biography.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kunjika S=\r\nhortram one recites to overcome any mistakes one may have done \n&gt; with reci=\r\nting chandi paath. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; by the way one can listen kunjika shotram in be=\r\nautiful voice of shree \n&gt; maa as follows\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.shreemaa.org/drupa=\r\nl/node/1546, on this page there is a link.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards\n&gt; Mitesh\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; \n&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; For someone who cannot speak sanskrit or is not even=\r\n very fluent with \n&gt;&gt; any of the Indian lnaguges, can such a person do a ho=\r\nma of the \n&gt; Kunjika \n&gt;&gt; Stotra instead of the actual full Durgasaptasati. =\r\nSpecially since in \n&gt;&gt; the beginning of the Kunjika, it says Kunjika path i=\r\ns almost \n&gt;&gt; equivalent to Durgasaptasti.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; -Regards\n&gt;&gt;  Rajarshi\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_018F_01C9960C.56E6F3C0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3492&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste=\r\n,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;F=\r\nONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&gt; Kunjika Shotram is a very powerful one, why =\r\ndo \nhoman of it&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;That is not a valid reason. &lt;/FONT&gt;=\r\n&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;Even a very powerful mantra can be offered in =\r\nhomam.
