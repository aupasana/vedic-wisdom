If it is possible to do in the same place everyday, it is better. But, if you are anyway travelling, it is better to do where you are, instead of leaving it completely.\n \nWhen I and Manish were travelling in India when making the documentary &quot;Krishna: History or Myth&quot;, we did homam in several towns - in hotels, at houses and on the roadside.\n \nMy suggestion is to do it at your mother&#39;s place, if your mother has no problem with it. It should be good for your mother&#39;s place too.\n \nThat height is fine. The key is that the base of homa kundam should be higher than the base of your body (the only exception to this is a homa kundam dug inside the earth). So make sure that the seat in the chair is slightly lower than the height of the table. Then homa kundam will be higher.\n \nHabits coming from birth and arising due to strong conditioning are indeed tough to let go. Just keep trying. Rome is not built in a day!!\n \nOne useful technique some people use it to take god&#39;s name when one is angry and repeat it several times (e.g. &quot;Raama Raama Raama Raama&quot;). Even if angry thoughts are in the mind, let them be there and start saying god&#39;s name. After a few repetitions, slowly the focus of the mind may shift from the angry thoughts to god&#39;s name and one may calm down before saying abusive words. Give it a try.\n \nBTW, there is no need to call me Sir. I am just Narasimha or PVR.\n \nJupiter entered Meena, the sign of rishis, Vedic knowledge and liberation, yesterday late evening. The next few months are a good time for spiritual sadhana and progress.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- prm7782 &lt;prm7782@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Respected Sir and members,\n&gt; \n&gt; In the absence of Narsimha Sir, may I request the learned members to kindly answer my questions.\n&gt; \n&gt; I will be living in my mothers place for some time. Is it ok to perform homam in a new place? What I mean is Sir was mentioning that homam has to be done at the same time and same location everyday. So is new location fine?\n&gt; \n&gt; Narsimha sir, the other day I was in store and saw a table of height two feet.Would the table be an appropriate height for placing the havan kunda if one decides to do homa in a table and chair? If No then can you please give exact specifications?\n&gt; \n&gt; I have two yantras and an idol in which pranpratishta has been done. The house will be empty and no one will be there to take care of it. So will it be ok to carry them along and pray at my mothers place. My mother says that once prana pratishta is done idols and yantras shouldn&#39;t be moved. \n&gt; \n&gt; There are some birth habits which I find very hard to let go, how to fight them.When I get angry I start using some abusive words which I later regret how to fight them. Does anyone know of any nice discourses in youtube or good tips which can help in fighting anger. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks and regards,\n&gt; Priya\n\n\n"}}
