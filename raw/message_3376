It is a significant step in one&#39;=\r\ns spiritual evolution, but still not the ultimate.&quot; - Sadhguru\n&gt; \n&gt; There a=\r\nre various types of samadhis. For the sake of understanding, samadhis have =\r\nbeen classified into eight forms. Of these eight, they have been broadly ca=\r\ntegorized as savikalpa and nirvikalpa, samadhis with attributes or qualitie=\r\ns and samadhis without attributes or qualities. \n&gt; \n&gt; We see with Isha Yoga=\r\n, people go into different types of samadhis. Here it is common to witness =\r\nboth savikalpa and nirvikalpa types. Samadhi is a certain state of equanimi=\r\nty where the intellect goes beyond its normal function of discrimination. T=\r\nhis, in turn, loosens one from his physical body. In samadhi states, one be=\r\ncomes loose inside the body or there is a space between what is you and you=\r\nr body. These samadhis, by themselves have no great significance in terms o=\r\nf Realization. Experiencing a certain type of samadhi, does not mean you ar=\r\ne released from Existence. It is just a new level of experience. \n&gt; \n&gt; It i=\r\ns like when you were a child, you had one level of experience, once you mov=\r\ned into your adulthood, you have another level of experience. The same thin=\r\ngs that you have experienced at a particular point in your life, after a fe=\r\nw years, you experience them in a totally different way. So, you have moved=\r\n from one level of experience to another level of experience. \n&gt; \n&gt; Samadhi=\r\ns are just like this. You are moving from one level of experience to anothe=\r\nr level of experience in a much more significant and deeper sense. Still, i=\r\nt is just another level of experience.\n&gt; \n&gt; Somebody may go into a certain =\r\nlevel of samadhi and stay there for years because it is enjoyable. There is=\r\n no space or time. There are no bodily problems. He has broken the physical=\r\n and psychological barriers to some extent. But this is only temporary. The=\r\n moment he comes out, again he gets hungry, he has to sleep, and again ever=\r\nything comes back. \n&gt; \n&gt; Samadhi definitely has its benefits. There are man=\r\ny things it has to offer for an individual, but this doesn&#39;t really take yo=\r\nu closer to Realization, as such. Compared to a man who is sober, a man who=\r\n is slightly drunk, has a different level of experience, but he has to come=\r\n down at some point. All samadhis, I would say, are a way of getting high w=\r\nithout any external chemicals. Now, by going into these states, it opens up=\r\n a new dimension for you, but it doesn&#39;t leave any great transformation beh=\r\nind. It doesn&#39;t leave you permanently transformed. \n&gt; \n&gt; You have not moved=\r\n into another reality. In the same reality, your level of experiences has d=\r\neepened. You have experienced the same things in a little deeper sense. You=\r\n have not become free from the mind. \n&gt; \n&gt; Now, somebody meditates for 12 y=\r\nears and comes out. Even after 12 years, he may not be a realized being, bu=\r\nt, maybe he is a little closer. When you go into another reality and stay t=\r\nhere for long hours or long years, the grip of this reality is broken on yo=\r\nu. Now, you have come to an experiential understanding that, this is not it=\r\n. Not just an intellectual understanding, you have seen experientially that=\r\n this is not it. That is the whole purpose of long meditations. But most re=\r\nalized beings never went into samadhi states. \n&gt; \n&gt; Gautama never sat for 1=\r\n2 years in one place. Many of his disciples, many Buddhist monks went into =\r\nvery long meditations. They never came out for years, but Gautama himself n=\r\never went, because he saw it is not necessary. \n&gt; \n&gt; He practiced and exper=\r\nienced all the eight kinds of samadhis before his enlightenment and he disc=\r\narded them. He said, &quot;This is not it&quot;. This is not going to take you any cl=\r\noser to realization. It is just moving into a higher level of experience an=\r\nd probably you will get more caught up, because it is more beautiful than t=\r\nhe current reality. \n&gt; \n&gt; If the goal is set, if you&#39;ve made realization th=\r\ne top priority in your life, then every thing else which doesn&#39;t take you o=\r\nne step closer is meaningless. Let&#39;s say you are climbing the Mount Everest=\r\n, you will not take one step sideways, because every ounce of energy is nee=\r\nded. Now, if you have to transcend your own consciousness, you need every o=\r\nunce of what you have and it&#39;s not enough. So, any action that we perform, =\r\nwe don&#39;t want it to be a sidewinder.\n&gt; \n&gt; We have created powerful consecra=\r\nted spaces where experiencing samadhi states comes very naturally. There ar=\r\ne samadhis that are very pleasant, blissful, and ecstatic and there are sam=\r\nadhis that are beyond this. Those who go into samadhi states beyond pleasan=\r\nt or unpleasant, or nirvikalpa, we always keep them in protected states as =\r\ntheir contact with the body has become very minimal. The smallest disturban=\r\nce, like a sound or a pinprick would dislodge them from their body. These s=\r\ntates are maintained for certain periods to establish the distinction betwe=\r\nen you and the body. It is a significant step in one&#39;s spiritual evolution,=\r\n but still not the Ultimate.\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@...=\r\nm, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [&quot;W=\r\nhen I am in Nirvikalpa samadhi, there is no experience.

You correctly questioned how different\n&gt; &gt; people can de=\r\nscribe &quot;Nirvikalpa samadhi&quot; differently.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The issue is this.=\r\n Nirvikalpa samadhi is a state of being where there\n&gt; &gt; is no &quot;experiencer&quot;=\r\n, nothing &quot;to experience&quot; and also no act of\n&gt; &gt; &quot;experiencing&quot;. In other w=\r\nords, there is no observer (subject), observed\n&gt; &gt; (object) and observing (=\r\naction).

If there=\r\n is no objectification, how can\n&gt; &gt; there be any experience or observation?=\r\n If there is no observation and\n&gt; &gt; experience, how can you describe Nirvik=\r\nalpa samadhi?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomline is that there is nothing to descri=\r\nbe in Nirvikalpa samadhi.\n&gt; &gt; Regarding Nirvikalpa samadhi, Manish once sai=\r\nd to me: &quot;When I am in\n&gt; &gt; Nirvikalpa samadhi, there is no experience. Thus=\r\n, anything I say about\n&gt; &gt; the &quot;experience&quot; of Nirvikalpa samadhi is actual=\r\nly the observation of an\n&gt; &gt; I-ness as it is being torn down or being recon=\r\nstructed, i.e. just before\n&gt; &gt; or after Nirvikalpa samadhi but not *during*=\r\n it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is essentially the problem with &quot;describing&quot; Nir=\r\nvikalpa samadhi!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2 =C2=\r\n =C2 =C2 =C2\n&gt; &gt; =C2  *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In terms of the diamond analogy quo=\r\nted by Kishore, what different\n&gt; &gt; yogis are saying about the &quot;experience&quot; =\r\nof Nirvikalpa samadhi says more\n&gt; &gt; about the path they are taking into the=\r\n inside of the diamond, rather\n&gt; &gt; than describing the inside of the diamon=\r\nd itself. One may think &quot;nothing\n&gt; &gt; really exists apart from Brahman - all=\r\n this I am perceiving is a\n&gt; &gt; delusion&quot;. Another may think &quot;all I perceive=\r\n is actually Brahman&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; Another may think &quot;all that I perceive is actual=\r\nly a minute part of\n&gt; &gt; Krishna&quot;. And so on. Once one is able to focus I-ne=\r\nss on a specific\n&gt; &gt; thought and everything else disappears from the mind, =\r\none is in samadhi.\n&gt; &gt; Once that I-ness also disappears, one is in Nirvikal=\r\npa samadhi. However,\n&gt; &gt; one can only describe the last thought on which I-=\r\nness was focused prior\n&gt; &gt; to Nirvikalpa samadhi and NOT the Nirvikalpa sam=\r\nadhi itself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some yogis prefer the stage just before Nirvik=\r\nalpa samadhi where a\n&gt; &gt; trace of I-ness is left in an intense focus on one=\r\n thought, to\n&gt; &gt; Nirvikalpa samadhi itself. In the former, there is an expe=\r\nrience and\n&gt; &gt; bliss - some rasa (juice). In the latter, there is no experi=\r\nence.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =\r\n=C2\n&gt; &gt; =C2  *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Buddha is a great jnaani and his statement i=\r\ns perfect. However, one\n&gt; &gt; who is not at Buddha&#39;s wavelength can easily mi=\r\nsunderstand it. If an\n&gt; &gt; observer exists and observes &quot;void&quot;, that is diff=\r\nerent. What we are\n&gt; &gt; talking about here is the absence of observer, i.e. =\r\nmerging of observer,\n&gt; &gt; observed and the act of observing into one, withou=\r\nt ANY distinction\n&gt; &gt; whatsoever between them. Is &quot;void&quot; the right word to =\r\ndescribe that state\n&gt; &gt; or is &quot;everything&quot; the right word? Is there a good =\r\nway to describe it?\n&gt; &gt; Problem is that the word &quot;void&quot; may make people ima=\r\ngine a scenario where\n&gt; &gt; there is an observer, but a void to observe.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2  Free Jyotish Software, =\r\nFree Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manua=\r\nls for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2=\r\n =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2\n&gt; &gt; =C2 =C2 =C2  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  Films that make a difference:\n&gt; &gt; http://SaraswatiFilm=\r\ns.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  Spirituality:\n&gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/J=\r\nyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 12/29/09, rajarshi nandy rajarshi=\r\n14@ wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: rajarshi nandy rajarshi14@\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic=\r\n-wisdom] Samadhi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday=\r\n, December 29, 2009, 1:27 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I understand the example given in that superb mail, yet som=\r\ne confusion\n&gt; &gt; exist (in my understanding) .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; See, Sri Rama=\r\nkrishna, when he was asked about Nirvikalpa Samadhi said\n&gt; &gt; he cannot desc=\r\nribe it in words like the salt doll example provided by\n&gt; &gt; Hari.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After all, Rigveda says &quot;ekam sat vipraa bahudhaa vadanti&quot;, which\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; means\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Truth is One, but the learned call differently&quot; .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; True. Now I see this line in different ways - 1) As different sai=\r\nnts\n&gt; &gt; have mentioned different sadhanas/paths to achieve God. 2) Secondly=\r\n as\n&gt; &gt; you mentioned, that Truth is One, but saints call it differently.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From=C2 from the diamond analogy I understand that if=C2 X r=\r\neaches a\n&gt; &gt; certain face of the diamond and Y reaches another face of the =\r\ndiamond,\n&gt; &gt; they percieve it differently, thought both faces are the same =\r\ndiamond,\n&gt; &gt; just different aspects. This is OK. This can be equal to savik=\r\nalpa\n&gt; &gt; samadhi and may be experienced differently depending upon the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nindividual.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As you break through any =\r\nface of the diamond\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and jump into the interior of the diamond, you =\r\nno longer perceive\n&gt; &gt; the faces=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the diamond or the world out=\r\nside. There are no longer any objects\n&gt; &gt; or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attributes.=C2  There =\r\nis no I-ness or It-ness or experience. The\n&gt; &gt; experiencer,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experie=\r\nnced and experience all merge into one.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) This seems logic=\r\nal and is also the main cause of my confusion.\n&gt; &gt; When=C2 we say that we e=\r\nnter the middle of the diamond, when duality is\n&gt; &gt; no more, then how can i=\r\nt=C2 be experienced differently by different\n&gt; &gt; people? Shouldn&#39;t it be=C2=\r\n  the same? I thought, whichever face of teh\n&gt; &gt; diamond you chose as your =\r\nentry point, the middle of teh diamond should\n&gt; &gt; feel and look exactly sim=\r\nilar. Please correct me if I am wrong in my\n&gt; &gt; understanding.=C2 =C2 And y=\r\net these three spiritual gaints have spoken\n&gt; &gt; differently of their realiz=\r\nations. If duality itself does not exist,\n&gt; &gt; then how can the field of pos=\r\nsiblity at all arise? Which means, how can\n&gt; &gt; there be a difference in the=\r\n &quot;perception&quot; of the same One final Truth?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Not to mentio=\r\nn the query about whether, that which is\n&gt; &gt; transcendental in its basic na=\r\nture (Truth/One/Middle of the\n&gt; &gt; diamond),=C2 can=C2 at all be=C2 describe=\r\nd from within the field of\n&gt; &gt; duality? Then I wonder why these three peopl=\r\ne - saints of highest order\n&gt; &gt; - try to describe it when all descriptions =\r\nare from within duality...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Considering the above, I underst=\r\nand the wisdom (theoritically) of why\n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna refused to describe N=\r\nirvikalpa Samadhi.=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I also wonder whether=C2 the three sa=\r\nints, Sri Ramana Maharishi, Sri\n&gt; &gt; Aurobindo and Lord Buddha were speaking=\r\n from teh same realization of=C2\n&gt; &gt; the One/Truth, or was it different kin=\r\nds of realizations.
