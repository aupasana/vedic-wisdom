Jodha Akbar is a\ntremen=\r\ndous film showing the glorious reign of Akbar, who indeed was\ntruly a great=\r\n ruler. I feel ashamed of Hindus who try and bring a Muslim\nbias into such =\r\ncinematic achievements. I will implore such people to\nappreciate the truth =\r\nbehind Akbar and his admiraton of Hindu religion\nwhich has been beautifully=\r\n depicted in the movie. For those who havent\nseen it yet, it is not be miss=\r\ned. Best wishes Sharat\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.=\r\nR. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaskaram anna,\n&gt;\n&gt; I saw this movie and I ca=\r\nnnot help responding.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is true that Hindus and sanatana dharma suffer=\r\ned badly at the hands\nof Muslim invaders (and other invaders), but it is wr=\r\nong to take out\nthat anger on Akbar. Some people cannot see beyond a man&#39;s =\r\nname and\nreligion and hence cannot recognize when a great celestial being i=\r\ns born\nin a different religion.\n&gt;\n&gt; Swami Vimalananda, the Aghori yogi ment=\r\nioned in the &quot;Aghora&quot; series\nbooks, is somebody who achieved the highest st=\r\nates of consciousness. He\nreceived a lot of knowledge directly from Mother =\r\nTara. Accordinging to\nhim, Akbar and Jodha were the re-incarnation of Samyu=\r\nkta and Rajput King\nPrithviraj Chouhan. As Prithviraj, he repelled so many =\r\nMuslim invaders\nat the border of India. When Muslims finally conquered Indi=\r\na, he was\nreborn as one of them and put breaks on their aggression and chan=\r\nged\ntheir ways.\n&gt;\n&gt; In that age, Muslim invaders engaged in barbarism, dest=\r\nroyed temples,\nlibraries and other relics of native religion and culture. T=\r\nhey beheaded\nHindus who refused to convert, they raped Hindu women and they=\r\n beheaded\ndefeated kings. They just tried to wipe out the native religion a=\r\nnd\nculture and replace with theirs. Akbar slowed down the barbarism and\nagg=\r\nression and promoted tolerance and integration. He stopped the forced\nconve=\r\nrsions, rapes and beheadings of Hindus. He stopped the destruction\nof templ=\r\nes and libraries. He talked about respecting other religions\nwhile followin=\r\ng one&#39;s own religion. He even took on the mighty Muslim\nclerics when he abo=\r\nlished a special tax on Hindus based on religion. He\nwas a man of great cha=\r\nracter, conviction and principles and was utterly\nfearless. He had affinity=\r\n for Rajputs and was even born in a Rajput\nfamily and spent early years the=\r\nre. He displayed the samskaras and\ninstincts of a refined and cultured Rajp=\r\nut more than those a of Mughal\nking - he was so unlike his grandfather Baba=\r\nr, father Humayun and\nstep-brother Adham.\n&gt;\n&gt; He used to offer arghyas to S=\r\nun in the morning and then participate in\na Zoroastrian fire ritual of Fars=\r\nis (similar to our homam) and then do a\nnamaz with Muslim clerics. Such tol=\r\nerance was unheard of from any other\nMuslim ruler in those days (or perhaps=\r\n even today!). Towards the end of\nhis life, he even started his own religio=\r\nn, which was based on his\nrealization and is quite noble. He was a spiritua=\r\nlly elevated soul.\nIrrespective of the religion one follows, one deserves o=\r\nur respect and\nadmiration if one embodies the spirit of sanatana dharma in =\r\none&#39;s\nthoughts and actions.\n&gt;\n&gt; Akbar was a true hero - a being who came do=\r\nwn from a higher loka to\nfulfil a certain mission with the blessings of ris=\r\nhis. His contribution\nto the safekeeping of sanatana dharma is not to be ju=\r\ndged from what harm\nhis fellow Muslims inflicted on sanatana dharma. His co=\r\nntribution is to\nbe judged from what *more* harm to sanatana dharma he help=\r\ned *avoid*. If\nhe had not come, I have no doubt that sanatana dharma would =\r\nhave\nsuffered much much more than it did. That was not the wish of rishis a=\r\nnd\nthat is why they sent somebody to alter the course and minimize the\nharm=\r\n. It is unfortunate that those who see the goodness of emperor\nAshoka and k=\r\ning Shivaji cannot see the goodness of Akbar simply because\nhe was a Muslim=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is unfortunate that some Hindus are equating Akbar with the other\n=\r\ncruel and barbaric Muslim kings. Who should be (was) a friend of Hindus\nis =\r\nbeing portrayed as an enemy and being shot down. Instead, we should\npromote=\r\n his story and inspire more people to be like him. He was a great\ninspirati=\r\nonal figure then and should be now too.\n&gt;\n&gt; The epic movie &quot;Jodha Albar&quot; is=\r\n a very good movie about one of the\ngreatest and most dharmik emperors of I=\r\nndia. The director and actor did\njustice to a man of great character that A=\r\nkbar was. I am sad about the\nmud-slinging that some of my fellow Hindus are=\r\n engaging in. Please do\nnot assassinate the character of Akbar.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you =\r\nwant, please make movies of the same caliber and cinematic\nexcellence on gr=\r\neat Hindu heroes such as Chatrapati Shivaji, Prithviraj\nChouhan, Sri Krishn=\r\nadeva Raya, Vikramarka, Salivahana, Ashoka,\nJnaaneshwar, Chaitanya Mahaprab=\r\nhu, Shankaracharya, Ramakrishna\nParamahamsa, Vivekananda, Ramana Maharshi e=\r\ntc.
