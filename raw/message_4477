Patanjali=E2=80=99s =\r\nfirst sutras are indeed the climax of all systems of yoga. All\nyogas aim at=\r\n the cessation of the vritti (modification of the mind). This\ncan be brough=\r\nt about in the variety of ways mentioned in the scriptures\nthrough mind con=\r\ntrol,which frees consciousness from all thoughts and keeps\nit pure. Effort =\r\nis necessary.
