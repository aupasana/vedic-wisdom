I really dont have the words to express =\r\nmy gratitude.\n\nFirst of all with Homam Kundam I have ordered it online from=\r\n an Indian\n store, I am expecting it in few weeks time after which I will s=\r\ntart\ndoing Homam.\n\nAnother thing is you mentioned about drigdasa Pisces fro=\r\nm March 2008\nto March 2017 but when I checked in Parashar it shows me it is=\r\n from\nMarch 2007 to March 2016. I am just a novice in astrology so if you\nc=\r\nan explain me which one is correct.\n\nAs you mentioned it is correct that I =\r\nhave been a devotee of Shri\nKrishna since childhood.\n\nNext thing is about m=\r\neditation, can you please advise me any good\nmeditation postures or any boo=\r\nk where I can learn some.\n\nLike I said before there are so many other quest=\r\nions which come up in\nmy mind. Although you will find that most of them are=\r\n silly questions\nbut if you can answer them in brief it will increase my fa=\r\nith in\nscriptures and clear my doubts.\n\n-When did Lord Ramchandra appear. S=\r\nome say He appeared few thousand\nyears before Lord Krishna, Is that true?\n\n=\r\n-As most of the people believe these days that the Vedas were\nwritten/revea=\r\nled 7-8000 yrs ago, if this is true then what was the\nsource of knowledge b=\r\nefore that?\n\n-Why most of the Darshans are also few thousand years old, was=\r\nnt there\nany philosophy before that?\n\n-What is the divison of the ages(yuga=\r\ns). Again there is a lot of\nconfusion here as some say they are thousands o=\r\nf years long but others\nsay millions of years long. Can you please explain =\r\nit.\n\n-You advised me to worship Lord Varaha (Vishnu&#39;s boar incarnation).\nCa=\r\nn you please explain if this is an allegory/metaphor or a real story\nand is=\r\n there any special method to worship Varaha incarnation. Also\ncan you pleas=\r\ne illustrate the meaning of the form of Vishnu.\n\n-I am getting married in O=\r\nct this year, can u please tell me how is it\ngoing to affect my spiritual l=\r\nife. My fiancee&#39;s Birth Details- 02 Oct\n1980, 13:20, New Delhi, India.\n\n\nI =\r\ndo not want to waste too much of your precious time but I feel only\nyou can=\r\n clear my doubts as there is no one else whom I can ask. \n\nThank you\nSanjee=\r\nv\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt;\nwr=\r\note:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Sanjeev ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; It happens to everybody. People find thei=\r\nr path, make some progress\nand then \n&gt; feel lost again.\n&gt; \n&gt; You run the dr=\r\nigdasa of Pisces from March 2008 to March 2017. Taking\nCancer \n&gt; as progres=\r\nsed lagna in Pisces dasa, the 9th house will be strong with \n&gt; Mercury and =\r\nSun and the 9th lord Jupiter will be in lagna. The 8th\nhouse \n&gt; will be pro=\r\nminent with Mars and Ketu, with 8th lords Saturn and Rahu \n&gt; aspecting them=\r\n from 2nd. These 4 malefics on the 8th house axis\nstrongly \n&gt; suggest power=\r\nful mystical experiences.\n&gt; \n&gt; You are on the verge of a rewarding time spi=\r\nritually speaking. Just\nkeep \n&gt; your faith and patience for a few more year=\r\ns and keep doing your\nsadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; The 5th house of devotion has Moon in r=\r\nasi and vimsamsa. This shows\ndevotion \n&gt; to Krishna. In navamsa, the 12th f=\r\nrom atma karaka is empty and\nMercury owns \n&gt; it. Mercury is in Scorpio with=\r\n Rahu. This suggests that worship of Lord \n&gt; Varaha (Vishnu&#39;s boar incarnat=\r\nion) can give you fast spiritual progress.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please contact suresh.batta=\r\nr@... (http://ashramaustralia.net) and ask \n&gt; him where you can get a homa =\r\nkundam in Australia. Swami Suresh\nBattar is a \n&gt; Hindu priest in Canberra. =\r\nIn case homa kundas are available there,\nhe may be \n&gt; able to direct you. I=\r\nn the worst case, any square or circle shaped\nvessel \n&gt; with some depth (ma=\r\nde of copper or bronze but not iron) can be used.\nGood \n&gt; luck for your hom=\r\nam.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding books, there are too many. But direct experience through=\r\n \n&gt; meditation is a far better teacher than books. Just surrender to the\nLo=\r\nrd, \n&gt; accept wholeheartedly that all the diverse objects our senses\npercei=\r\nve in \n&gt; this universe are all different manifestations of the Lord and tha=\r\nt\nwe are \n&gt; perceiving them differently because of our own impurity. If we =\r\nkeep \n&gt; reminding ourselves of this whenever our mind is overly attracted t=\r\no or \n&gt; repelled by something, that itself is a very useful sadhana. In\nadd=\r\nition, if \n&gt; you spend a considerable time everyday in meditation, that too=\r\n helps.\n&gt; \n&gt; For you, I strongly recommend &quot;Jnaneshwari&quot;, a commentary on\nB=\r\nhagavadGita by \n&gt; Jnaneshwar Maharaj. This is a unique commentary by a uniq=\r\nue saint,\nwho is \n&gt; the re-incarnation of a rishi and had a direct dwaitic =\r\nand adwaitic \n&gt; experience. There is a difference between writings coming f=\r\nrom\nknowledge \n&gt; acquired by reading books or hearing from others and writi=\r\nngs coming\nfrom \n&gt; the knowledge acquired in a direct experience. More than=\r\n 700 years ago, \n&gt; Jnaneshwar Maharaj entered a cave in Alandi in his physi=\r\ncal body at\nthe age \n&gt; of 21 years and still meditating there. I have NOT r=\r\nead a more\ncompetent or \n&gt; sublime commentary on Krishna&#39;s teaching. It is =\r\nquite an inspired\nwork. A \n&gt; good English translation of this work is avail=\r\nable at\n&gt; \n&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Jnaneshwars-Gita-Jnaneshwari-Swami-Kripa=\r\nnanda/dp/0911307648\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; is the highest work on Hindu ph=\r\nilosophy in my\nopinion. \n&gt; When Maharshi Viswamitra wanted Lord Ramachandra=\r\n to come with him to\nforest, \n&gt; Rama was in confusion and a little pensive.=\r\n In the presence of Maharshi \n&gt; Viswamitra, King Dasaratha and many other l=\r\nearned people, Maharshi\nVasishtha \n&gt; imparted the essence of all Upanishats=\r\n to Rama. His teachings were\ncaptured \n&gt; by Valmiki and the work is known a=\r\ns &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot;. There is an\ninspired \n&gt; English translation available=\r\n at\n&gt; \n&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Vasisthas-Yoga-Venkatesananda/dp/0791413640/=\r\nref=3Dsr_1_1?ie=3DUTF8&s=3Dbooks&qid=3D1201988303&sr=3D1-1\n&gt; \n&gt; Various Pur=\r\nanas and Upanishats make a very useful reading too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Na=\r\nrasimha\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-\n&gt; Do Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Spi=\r\nrituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lesson=\r\ns (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Window=\r\ns): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: ht=\r\ntp://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;Sanjeev Nar=\r\nula&quot; &lt;san_narula@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Saturday=\r\n, February 02, 2008 12:46 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Need more help\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha Ji and all other aspirants.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Although this is=\r\n my first writing in this group but i have been\n&gt; &gt; reading the threads for=\r\n almost one year now. And you people have\n&gt; &gt; helped me a lot to find out t=\r\nhe right path at many times but now i\n&gt; &gt; feel a bit lost again.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As=\r\n it can be seen from my chart details what brought me here( and to\n&gt; &gt; spir=\r\nitual path) like many others. I still remember the thread where\n&gt; &gt; Narasim=\r\nha Ji said that there is no need to fear of Sani and now i have\n&gt; &gt; realise=\r\nd what he meant.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have learned a little bit of astrology from this=\r\n thread and from\n&gt; &gt; other  sources but with that i can not really make any=\r\n decisions of\n&gt; &gt; the path i need to follow. As i have seen that there are =\r\nmany\n&gt; &gt; enlightened and intelligent aspirants in this group so if\n&gt; &gt; some=\r\none(especially Narasimha Ji)can look at my chart and guide me i\n&gt; &gt; will be=\r\n very thankful. My birth details are given below:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Birth Date- 17/03=\r\n/1979\n&gt; &gt; Birth Time- 12:45 PM\n&gt; &gt; Birth Place- Ferozepur(Punjab), India\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Another thing is that till now i have been reading some\n&gt; &gt; Scripture=\r\ns/Spiritual writings from here and there and doing some\n&gt; &gt; meditation and =\r\nchanting of Mahamantra. I have really seen and\n&gt; &gt; experienced the effect o=\r\nf all this but all this was random and\n&gt; &gt; unplanned. Now i have come to a =\r\nstage where i feel that my spiritual\n&gt; &gt; progress has stopped. So first of =\r\nall i am thinking of reading more to\n&gt; &gt; get some knowledge but i have no i=\r\ndea what to read and from where to\n&gt; &gt; get the books.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Second thing =\r\nis i am planning to do Mahaganapathi Homam on a regular\n&gt; &gt; basis so i have=\r\n bought all the Materials Needed except the homa kundam\n&gt; &gt; which i could n=\r\not find as i live in Australia so can anyone tell me\n&gt; &gt; what else can i us=\r\ne as i can not even dig a pit in the ground.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Although there are so =\r\nmany other things i want to ask but if someone\n&gt; &gt; can help me with only th=\r\nese i would be very thankful to him and i will\n&gt; &gt; pray to Lord for him.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance\n&gt; &gt; Sanjeev\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
