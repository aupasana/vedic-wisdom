That is the reason why the Sastras and saints censure and condemn =\r\nwomen in order to create dispassion and discrimination in men and wean them=\r\n from lustful tendencies and aggressive attacks. Sri Sankara, Sri Dattatrey=\r\na, Sri Rama, Sri Tulasidas have all criticised women not out of hatred, pre=\r\njudice or dislike, but out of compassion for elevating people from the quag=\r\nmire of Samsara. Their criticism of women implies and includes criticism of=\r\n man also. Their criticism aims at weaning the minds of worldly persons fro=\r\nm sexual sin and creating disgust for sexual pleasure, and dispassion for w=\r\norldly objects. This is misunderstood by people.\n\nThe same scriptures and s=\r\naints who censure women in one place praise them in another.  They say, &#39;Wo=\r\nmen should be honoured. They are Ardhanginis. They are manifestations of Sa=\r\nkti or the energy of the Lord. Only those who honour women can attain prosp=\r\nerity.&#39;...\n\nThe minds of young people are saturated with impure Samskaras a=\r\nnd Vasanas owing to vicious company and the false modern civilization. Even=\r\n the company or talk of a woman is quite sufficient to drag the mind into v=\r\nicious thoughts. So, I have to place before the minds of the vast majority =\r\nsuch a mental picture that the very company of women will do havoc. When I =\r\nsay that a woman is only a leather bag, I do not hate women in any way. It =\r\nis only to produce disgust and induce Vairagya. Really, a woman should be a=\r\ndored as Mother Sakti. She is the creatrix, generatrix and nourisher of the=\r\n universe. She must be revered. In India, religion is preserved and maintai=\r\nned only through the devotional element in women. Devotion is a fundamental=\r\n characteristic of Hindu ladies. Hate lust, but not women.&quot;\n\nI absolutely a=\r\ngree that disgust for anyone - family members, women, or anybody else - is =\r\nsimply another form of attachment and not beneficial to anyone.  But part o=\r\nf Swami Sivananda&#39;s way seems to be the use of discomfiting and unpleasant =\r\nlanguage, to either startle the reader into a different sort of understandi=\r\nng, or touch a nerve with someone who might be on the fence about the topic=\r\n he&#39;s discussing.  I think the term &quot;leeches,&quot; and his disparaging remarks =\r\nabout family in general, may be intended to accomplish a similar goal as hi=\r\nnted in the discussion above - to shock a sluggish, worldly mind into reali=\r\nzation.\n\nIf nothing else, controversial wording can change ideas by sparkin=\r\ng discussion - and here we all are, discussing sannyasa on a Friday morning=\r\n (or Saturday afternoon, for some!) instead of doing more worldly things. :=\r\n)\n\nLeila\n\n\n"}}
