It becomes a play, a play of that only those two lovers can\n&gt; &gt; understan=\r\nd.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A little point about love these days, One day a man who is in l=\r\nove with\n&gt; &gt; the sun, was doing homam on , a sunday afternoon, in Hyderabad=\r\n, in an\n&gt; &gt; open field with no shade, in a temperature of 47 degree centigr=\r\nades and\n&gt; &gt; was sweating profusely as expected. He was getting irritated w=\r\nith the\n&gt; &gt; sweat coming into his eyes. Suddenly the sun asked him, bete do=\r\n you want\n&gt; &gt; me to hide so that you are comfortable???\n&gt; &gt; The man looked =\r\ndown in shame upon himself and asked himself,\n&gt; &gt; we all can&#39;t stand him in=\r\n summers, I want him to  go away this very\n&gt; &gt; moment, just because my body=\r\n is trying to cool itself down with sweat.\n&gt; &gt; All of us look out for him i=\r\nn the winters calling him, coming out to\n&gt; &gt; sunbathe etc, yet in summers w=\r\ne abuse him, we wish to drive him away, we\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t wish to see his face, =\r\nis this my fucking love??? And to all that\n&gt; &gt; look at his love, he wants t=\r\no hide, &quot;wah pitaji&quot; ,the man said.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The man was humbled, and apolo=\r\ngized profusely, the sun forgave him\n&gt; &gt; because after all, you know, he is=\r\n the sun, the man only could say back\n&gt; &gt; &quot;shine on, I love &quot;you&quot;, no matte=\r\nr what.&quot; The temperature went up to 48.\n&gt; &gt; (That last line was a joke.)\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; In winters we all sing songs of loving the sun, yet in summers we ha=\r\nte\n&gt; &gt; him, that is not love, its mere usage, and since that orb is so\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nmagnanimous he still gives gives and gives, after all because of him\n&gt; &gt; th=\r\nere is photosynthesis, which leads to oxygen which leads to all of us\n&gt; &gt; b=\r\nreathing, he is god&#39;s foremost proof. Without him, this planet won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; ex=\r\nist, which leads to no economies, no mba&#39;s , no gdp, no play.\n&gt; &gt; Hell, he =\r\nburns for us, just because he loves us, true love it&#39;s called.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yet=\r\n what do most of us do, we don&#39;t give one shit for him for all our\n&gt; &gt; birt=\r\nhs combined.\n&gt; &gt; I am talking about people outside of all this worship busi=\r\nness. And\n&gt; &gt; there are quite a few.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; These days, if a man loves a =\r\ngirl and she doesn&#39;t respond favorably,\n&gt; &gt; automatically she is a whore fo=\r\nr that man. Just because she didn&#39;t give\n&gt; &gt; the man her body, she is a who=\r\nre!!!! Wah!! What love.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll tell you another story, there is a bo=\r\ny I know of in Delhi, he is in\n&gt; &gt; love with a certain girl. The girl has n=\r\never spoken with him, rarely met\n&gt; &gt; him, infact is oblivious to his existe=\r\nnce, and he is lost in god to\n&gt; &gt; actually care( Don&#39;t ask me why/how i kno=\r\nw these characters, I myself\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t know) He is ridiculously devoted to =\r\nhis chosen form of our mother,\n&gt; &gt; I asked him if you so love her why don&#39;t=\r\n you ask of her from god.\n&gt; &gt; Well, he slapped me. He told me you forgot Go=\r\nrakhnath&#39;s rule????? My\n&gt; &gt; mother will decide her daughter - in- law, meri=\r\n kya aukaad ki main ink\n&gt; &gt; bata-oon ki mujhe yeh chahiye ya mujhe who chah=\r\niye, mujhe peel meri maa\n&gt; &gt; chahiye, apni bhen maraaye duniya, this guy is=\r\n far more insane than\n&gt; &gt; quite a lot of people I have met.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Then h=\r\ne went on, that who told you that you are sure to get the one you\n&gt; &gt; love?=\r\n???\n&gt; &gt; You love then claim that somebody to be yours, yeah right, another\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; slap!!\n&gt; &gt; You people love, to get. I love for love&#39;s sake. All I can a=\r\nsk from God\n&gt; &gt; is to look out for her, protect her, but dare I ask for her=\r\n. The moment\n&gt; &gt; I ask, i am screwed, because I know it will be delivered, =\r\nbut then\n&gt; &gt; what&#39;s the fun in that, and when did i become big enough to kn=\r\now whats\n&gt; &gt; best for me???? yeh toh meri maa ka kaam hai, who jaane.  Rath=\r\ner my love\n&gt; &gt; should be so intense, that god herself should come and tell =\r\nme &quot;you, my\n&gt; &gt; son, deserve her.&quot;, and I&#39;d rather prefer that she (god) te=\r\nlls me first\n&gt; &gt; &quot;You , my son, deserve me.&quot;, because if I have her, i alre=\r\nady have that\n&gt; &gt; girl, who is eventually her.\n&gt; &gt; To top it all he says si=\r\nnce he claims to have surrendered, how can then\n&gt; &gt; he say anything to his =\r\ngod? He surrendered, bhagwaan dekhenge. If you\n&gt; &gt; have surrendered, then i=\r\nt should be total, not partial.

A dog will break his tail off by wagging\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nwhen he sees his master, that is devotion and love. He doesn&#39;t ask the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nmaster , to bring him chicken, or mutton, or food. His master brings,\n&gt; &gt; d=\r\noggy is happy, his master doesn&#39;t bring, still the tail is wagging,\n&gt; &gt; dog=\r\ngy is happy. Because doggy wants master, food is an afterthought.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nEquate doggy with us , and master with god, and what do we do?????\n&gt; &gt; We a=\r\nre never happy with what the master brings, because we were\n&gt; &gt; expecting b=\r\nutter chicken, who saala leke aaya paneer.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (Haanji madame waale he=\r\nro, phir chant nahin kar rahe, bhai kar lo, kar\n&gt; &gt; lo, Bolo hari bolo gopa=\r\nal bolo)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We actually don&#39;t want the master , we subconsciously wan=\r\nt the food, and\n&gt; &gt; then we claim to others , oh no no, I never want food ,=\r\n I only want him,\n&gt; &gt; yeah right!!\n&gt; &gt; If you only want him, why are you so=\r\n shit pissed off at the paneer????\n&gt; &gt; We are selfish dogs, always SUBCONSC=\r\nIOUSLY trying to form strategies so\n&gt; &gt; that masterji brings us that bitch,=\r\n that chicken, that mutton, that\n&gt; &gt; blanket, that milk, but we rarely do w=\r\nant the master. Our tail doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; wag at his thought.

It b=\r\necomes a play, a play of that only those two lovers can\n&gt; &gt; understand.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; A little point about love these days, One day a man who is in love wi=\r\nth\n&gt; &gt; the sun, was doing homam on , a sunday afternoon, in Hyderabad, in a=\r\nn\n&gt; &gt; open field with no shade, in a temperature of 47 degree centigrades a=\r\nnd\n&gt; &gt; was sweating profusely as expected. He was getting irritated with th=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; sweat coming into his eyes. Suddenly the sun asked him, bete do you w=\r\nant\n&gt; &gt; me to hide so that you are comfortable???\n&gt; &gt; The man looked down i=\r\nn shame upon himself and asked himself,\n&gt; &gt; we all can&#39;t stand him in summe=\r\nrs, I want him to  go away this very\n&gt; &gt; moment, just because my body is tr=\r\nying to cool itself down with sweat.\n&gt; &gt; All of us look out for him in the =\r\nwinters calling him, coming out to\n&gt; &gt; sunbathe etc, yet in summers we abus=\r\ne him, we wish to drive him away, we\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t wish to see his face, is thi=\r\ns my fucking love??? And to all that\n&gt; &gt; look at his love, he wants to hide=\r\n, &quot;wah pitaji&quot; ,the man said.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The man was humbled, and apologized =\r\nprofusely, the sun forgave him\n&gt; &gt; because after all, you know, he is the s=\r\nun, the man only could say back\n&gt; &gt; &quot;shine on, I love &quot;you&quot;, no matter what=\r\n.&quot; The temperature went up to 48.\n&gt; &gt; (That last line was a joke.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n In winters we all sing songs of loving the sun, yet in summers we hate\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n him, that is not love, its mere usage, and since that orb is so\n&gt; &gt; magnan=\r\nimous he still gives gives and gives, after all because of him\n&gt; &gt; there is=\r\n photosynthesis, which leads to oxygen which leads to all of us\n&gt; &gt; breathi=\r\nng, he is god&#39;s foremost proof. Without him, this planet won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; exist, w=\r\nhich leads to no economies, no mba&#39;s , no gdp, no play.\n&gt; &gt; Hell, he burns =\r\nfor us, just because he loves us, true love it&#39;s called.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yet what =\r\ndo most of us do, we don&#39;t give one shit for him for all our\n&gt; &gt; births com=\r\nbined.\n&gt; &gt; I am talking about people outside of all this worship business. =\r\nAnd\n&gt; &gt; there are quite a few.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; These days, if a man loves a girl a=\r\nnd she doesn&#39;t respond favorably,\n&gt; &gt; automatically she is a whore for that=\r\n man. Just because she didn&#39;t give\n&gt; &gt; the man her body, she is a whore!!!!=\r\n Wah!! What love.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll tell you another story, there is a boy I kn=\r\now of in Delhi, he is in\n&gt; &gt; love with a certain girl. The girl has never s=\r\npoken with him, rarely met\n&gt; &gt; him, infact is oblivious to his existence, a=\r\nnd he is lost in god to\n&gt; &gt; actually care( Don&#39;t ask me why/how i know thes=\r\ne characters, I myself\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t know) He is ridiculously devoted to his ch=\r\nosen form of our mother,\n&gt; &gt; I asked him if you so love her why don&#39;t you a=\r\nsk of her from god.\n&gt; &gt; Well, he slapped me. He told me you forgot Gorakhna=\r\nth&#39;s rule????? My\n&gt; &gt; mother will decide her daughter - in- law, meri kya a=\r\nukaad ki main ink\n&gt; &gt; bata-oon ki mujhe yeh chahiye ya mujhe who chahiye, m=\r\nujhe peel meri maa\n&gt; &gt; chahiye, apni bhen maraaye duniya, this guy is far m=\r\nore insane than\n&gt; &gt; quite a lot of people I have met.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Then he went=\r\n on, that who told you that you are sure to get the one you\n&gt; &gt; love????\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; You love then claim that somebody to be yours, yeah right, another\n&gt; &gt; sl=\r\nap!!\n&gt; &gt; You people love, to get. I love for love&#39;s sake. All I can ask fro=\r\nm God\n&gt; &gt; is to look out for her, protect her, but dare I ask for her. The =\r\nmoment\n&gt; &gt; I ask, i am screwed, because I know it will be delivered, but th=\r\nen\n&gt; &gt; what&#39;s the fun in that, and when did i become big enough to know wha=\r\nts\n&gt; &gt; best for me???? yeh toh meri maa ka kaam hai, who jaane.  Rather my =\r\nlove\n&gt; &gt; should be so intense, that god herself should come and tell me &quot;yo=\r\nu, my\n&gt; &gt; son, deserve her.&quot;, and I&#39;d rather prefer that she (god) tells me=\r\n first\n&gt; &gt; &quot;You , my son, deserve me.&quot;, because if I have her, i already ha=\r\nve that\n&gt; &gt; girl, who is eventually her.\n&gt; &gt; To top it all he says since he=\r\n claims to have surrendered, how can then\n&gt; &gt; he say anything to his god? H=\r\ne surrendered, bhagwaan dekhenge. If you\n&gt; &gt; have surrendered, then it shou=\r\nld be total, not partial. That doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; mean you sit on your ass warming=\r\n it up and saying what do I need to do,\n&gt; &gt; everything god will do, kyun bh=\r\nai bhagwaan ne ape baap ki naukri kari\n&gt; &gt; hui hai??\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Surrender is =\r\nyou do your duty, even if the results are &quot;bad&quot;, they are\n&gt; &gt; god&#39;s, the re=\r\nsults are &quot;good&quot;, they are god&#39;s, who are you in between.\n&gt; &gt; If you actual=\r\nly manage to surrender, you won&#39;t ever need a disprin or a\n&gt; &gt; counselor, b=\r\nelieve you me. Its a blissful life post the surrender, be it\n&gt; &gt; in a jhugg=\r\ni or be it in 25000 sq feet house, one and the same thing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One of =\r\nthe greatest men, the greatest, ever to grace this planet, has\n&gt; &gt; always m=\r\naintained be god&#39;s dog. A dog will break his tail off by wagging\n&gt; &gt; when h=\r\ne sees his master, that is devotion and love. He doesn&#39;t ask the\n&gt; &gt; master=\r\n , to bring him chicken, or mutton, or food. His master brings,\n&gt; &gt; doggy i=\r\ns happy, his master doesn&#39;t bring, still the tail is wagging,\n&gt; &gt; doggy is =\r\nhappy. Because doggy wants master, food is an afterthought.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Equate=\r\n doggy with us , and master with god, and what do we do?????\n&gt; &gt; We are nev=\r\ner happy with what the master brings, because we were\n&gt; &gt; expecting butter =\r\nchicken, who saala leke aaya paneer.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (Haanji madame waale hero, ph=\r\nir chant nahin kar rahe, bhai kar lo, kar\n&gt; &gt; lo, Bolo hari bolo gopaal bol=\r\no)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We actually don&#39;t want the master , we subconsciously want the =\r\nfood, and\n&gt; &gt; then we claim to others , oh no no, I never want food , I onl=\r\ny want him,\n&gt; &gt; yeah right!!\n&gt; &gt; If you only want him, why are you so shit =\r\npissed off at the paneer????\n&gt; &gt; We are selfish dogs, always SUBCONSCIOUSLY=\r\n trying to form strategies so\n&gt; &gt; that masterji brings us that bitch, that =\r\nchicken, that mutton, that\n&gt; &gt; blanket, that milk, but we rarely do want th=\r\ne master. Our tail doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; wag at his thought. Tails of great dogs do, =\r\nand what do we do, we read\n&gt; &gt; about the great dogs, and pretend that we to=\r\no are somewhere there, but\n&gt; &gt; nope.

Suddenly the sun asked him, bete do you want&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; me to hide=\r\n so that you are comfortable???&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The man looked down in shame =\r\nupon himself and asked himself,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; we all can&#39;t stand him in sum=\r\nmers, I want him to  go away this very&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; moment, just because m=\r\ny body is trying to cool itself down with sweat.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; All of us lo=\r\nok out for him in the winters calling him, coming out to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; sunb=\r\nathe etc, yet in summers we abuse him, we wish to drive him away, we&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; don&#39;t wish to see his face, is this my fucking love??? And to all t=\r\nhat&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; look at his love, he wants to hide, &quot;wah pitaji&quot; ,the man=\r\n said.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The man was humbled, and apologized pro=\r\nfusely, the sun forgave him&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; because after all, you know, he i=\r\ns the sun, the man only could say back&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;shine on, I love &quot;you=\r\n&quot;, no matter what.&quot; The temperature went up to 48.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (That last=\r\n line was a joke.)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; In winters we all sing song=\r\ns of loving the sun, yet in summers we hate&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; him, that is not =\r\nlove, its mere usage, and since that orb is so&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; magnanimous he=\r\n still gives gives and gives, after all because of him&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; there =\r\nis photosynthesis, which leads to oxygen which leads to all of us&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; breathing, he is god&#39;s foremost proof. Without him, this planet won&#39;t&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; exist, which leads to no economies, no mba&#39;s , no gdp, no pla=\r\ny.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hell, he burns for us, just because he loves us, true love=\r\n it&#39;s called.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yet what do most of us do, we do=\r\nn&#39;t give one shit for him for all our&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; births combined.&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; I am talking about people outside of all this worship business. And=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; there are quite a few.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; These da=\r\nys, if a man loves a girl and she doesn&#39;t respond favorably,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nautomatically she is a whore for that man. Just because she didn&#39;t give&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; the man her body, she is a whore!!!! Wah!! What love.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll tell you another story, there is a boy I know of in=\r\n Delhi, he is in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; love with a certain girl. The girl has never=\r\n spoken with him, rarely met&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; him, infact is oblivious to his =\r\nexistence, and he is lost in god to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; actually care( Don&#39;t ask =\r\nme why/how i know these characters, I myself&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t know) He i=\r\ns ridiculously devoted to his chosen form of our mother,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I as=\r\nked him if you so love her why don&#39;t you ask of her from god.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Well, he slapped me. He told me you forgot Gorakhnath&#39;s rule????? My&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; mother will decide her daughter - in- law, meri kya aukaad ki main=\r\n ink&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; bata-oon ki mujhe yeh chahiye ya mujhe who chahiye, mujh=\r\ne peel meri maa&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; chahiye, apni bhen maraaye duniya, this guy i=\r\ns far more insane than&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; quite a lot of people I have met.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Then he went on, that who told you that you are su=\r\nre to get the one you&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; love????&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; You love then cl=\r\naim that somebody to be yours, yeah right, another&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; slap!!&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; You people love, to get. I love for love&#39;s sake. All I can ask f=\r\nrom God&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; is to look out for her, protect her, but dare I ask f=\r\nor her. The moment&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I ask, i am screwed, because I know it wil=\r\nl be delivered, but then&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; what&#39;s the fun in that, and when did=\r\n i become big enough to know whats&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; best for me???? yeh toh me=\r\nri maa ka kaam hai, who jaane.  Rather my love&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; should be so i=\r\nntense, that god herself should come and tell me &quot;you, my&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; son=\r\n, deserve her.&quot;, and I&#39;d rather prefer that she (god) tells me first&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; &quot;You , my son, deserve me.&quot;, because if I have her, i already have =\r\nthat&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; girl, who is eventually her.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To top it all=\r\n he says since he claims to have surrendered, how can then&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; he=\r\n say anything to his god? He surrendered, bhagwaan dekhenge. If you&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; have surrendered, then it should be total, not partial. That doesn&#39;t=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; mean you sit on your ass warming it up and saying what do I =\r\nneed to do,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; everything god will do, kyun bhai bhagwaan ne ape=\r\n baap ki naukri kari&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; hui hai??&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; S=\r\nurrender is you do your duty, even if the results are &quot;bad&quot;, they are&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; god&#39;s, the results are &quot;good&quot;, they are god&#39;s, who are you in betw=\r\neen.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you actually manage to surrender, you won&#39;t ever need=\r\n a disprin or a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; counselor, believe you me. Its a blissful lif=\r\ne post the surrender, be it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; in a jhuggi or be it in 25000 sq =\r\nfeet house, one and the same thing.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; One of the=\r\n greatest men, the greatest, ever to grace this planet, has&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; a=\r\nlways maintained be god&#39;s dog. A dog will break his tail off by wagging&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; when he sees his master, that is devotion and love. He doesn&#39;t a=\r\nsk the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; master , to bring him chicken, or mutton, or food. His=\r\n master brings,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; doggy is happy, his master doesn&#39;t bring, sti=\r\nll the tail is wagging,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; doggy is happy. Because doggy wants m=\r\naster, food is an afterthought.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Equate doggy w=\r\nith us , and master with god, and what do we do?????&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; We are n=\r\never happy with what the master brings, because we were&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; expec=\r\nting butter chicken, who saala leke aaya paneer.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; (Haanji madame waale hero, phir chant nahin kar rahe, bhai kar lo, kar&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; lo, Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; W=\r\ne actually don&#39;t want the master , we subconsciously want the food, and&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; then we claim to others , oh no no, I never want food , I only w=\r\nant him,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; yeah right!!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you only want him, why=\r\n are you so shit pissed off at the paneer????&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; We are selfish =\r\ndogs, always SUBCONSCIOUSLY trying to form strategies so&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; that=\r\n masterji brings us that bitch, that chicken, that mutton, that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; blanket, that milk, but we rarely do want the master. Our tail doesn&#39;t&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wag at his thought. Tails of great dogs do, and what do we do,=\r\n we read&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; about the great dogs, and pretend that we too are so=\r\nmewhere there, but&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; nope. That is mental masturbation, its an =\r\nillusion just like porn.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sir, if you become do=\r\ng&#39;s dog, and then you walk on the left handed path,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; oye hoye =\r\nsir, the ethereal world will salute you.

The other person though could not stop himself. =\r\nHe went ahead, crossed the pool of waist deep water very pain-stakingly, wi=\r\nth great efforts reached the temple and did his job of abusing the deity.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The lord became very pleased with him and gave him Darsha=\r\nna.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ***&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Aparna ji, this is actually n=\r\not pointed at you.
