Eg Gayatri has 24 syllables, so one Purascharana is 24 lakh repetiti=\r\nons). He went on to say that 14 crore of japa with feeling would result in =\r\nDarshan of God in physical form, face to face. That would be great! Really =\r\nwanted to do it...but when I did the maths, I worked out that, at the rate =\r\nof 12 hours japa a day, every single day from now on, it would take me till=\r\n age 83 to finish this. :( \n&gt; \n&gt; But hey, I decided to make a start anyway,=\r\n and began my my first Purascharana of the Om Namo Narayanaya mantra, in Ja=\r\nnuary this year, I am doing a measley 11 rounds a day, with my mind wanderi=\r\nng most of the time (hard core people do hundreds of rounds with proper con=\r\ncentration daily). I&#39;m a slow chanter, and need to say the mantra loudly or=\r\n in a barely audible whisper. My mental chanting is gradually improving but=\r\n very difficult to do for more than 1-2 minutes. It&#39;s gonna take me till Oc=\r\ntober 2013 to finish the 8 lakhs. Then my plan is to take a 3 month break (=\r\nand do 7 rounds a day), and then start another Purascharana. \n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, =\r\ntwo things help me get my 11 rounds of japa done every day when I&#39;m at work=\r\n/outdoors. Thought I&#39;d mention it, if anybody&#39;s interested, just in case it=\r\n&#39;s helpful. \n&gt; \n&gt; One is Telephone Japa. I hold my mobile to my ear, and pr=\r\netend I&#39;m on the phone. While doing this, I stick my hand in my pocket and =\r\ncount the japa on my fingers. I get a couple of rounds done during my worki=\r\nng day this way (I check carefully to make sure nobody&#39;s listening). Also w=\r\nhile stuck in traffic (while the car is NOT moving), I put my hands-free ea=\r\nr pieces on, and pretend I&#39;m chatting to a friend on the phone and do a cou=\r\nple of rounds. \n&gt; \n&gt; The other thing that I find useful (now please excuse =\r\nthe phrase), is &quot;Toilet japa&quot;. When I need to escape to do a round or two o=\r\nf japa at work, I excuse myself for a few minutes and lock myself up in a t=\r\noilet cubicle. I then very very quietly mutter the mantra to myself for 5-1=\r\n0 minutes (lips moving, no sound audible, in case anybody hears). I do abou=\r\nt 2 sessions of this a day. This allows me to complete my 11 rounds a day, =\r\non days when my working hours are long. \n&gt; \n&gt; I know this sounds bonkers, b=\r\nut I thought I&#39;d mention this for anyone else whose work life interferes wi=\r\nth their japa. At least, it provides a solution to doing a bit of japa at w=\r\nork.\n&gt; \n&gt; If anybody else has any thoughts/suggestions, on how to repeat Go=\r\nd&#39; Name constantly, kindly share. \n&gt; \n&gt; Best wishes, and Om Namo Narayanaya=\r\n, \n&gt; \n&gt; Aparna\n&gt;\n\n\n \r\n---1846104760-2003098655-1340197273=:6901\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ti=\r\nmes new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dear Frein=\r\nds,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;Is &nbsp;it &nbsp;really &nbsp;maki=\r\nng &nbsp;a &nbsp;tag &nbsp;of &nbsp;number counts &nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;=\r\nJapa.

Thought I&#39;d mention it=\r\n, if anybody&#39;s interested, just in case it&#39;s helpful. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; O=\r\nne is Telephone Japa. I hold my mobile to my ear, and pretend I&#39;m on the ph=\r\none. While doing this, I stick my hand in my pocket and count the japa on m=\r\ny fingers. I get a couple of rounds done during my working day this way (I =\r\ncheck carefully to make sure nobody&#39;s listening). Also while stuck in traff=\r\nic (while the car is NOT moving), I put my hands-free ear pieces on, and pr=\r\netend I&#39;m chatting to a friend on the phone and do a couple of rounds. &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The other thing that I find useful (now please excuse the p=\r\nhrase), is &quot;Toilet japa&quot;. When I need to escape to do a round or two of jap=\r\na at work, I excuse myself for a few minutes and lock myself up in a toilet=\r\n cubicle. I then very very quietly mutter the mantra to myself for 5-10 min=\r\nutes (lips moving, no sound audible, in case anybody hears). I do about 2 s=\r\nessions of this a day. This allows me to complete my 11 rounds a day, on da=\r\nys when my working hours are long. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I know this sounds b=\r\nonkers, but I thought I&#39;d mention this for anyone else whose work life inte=\r\nrferes with their japa. At least, it provides a solution to doing a bit of =\r\njapa at work.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; If anybody else has any thoughts/suggestio=\r\nns, on how to repeat God&#39; Name constantly, kindly share. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; Best wishes, and Om Namo Narayanaya, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Aparna&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n---1846104760-2003098655-1340197273=:6901--\r\n\n"}}
