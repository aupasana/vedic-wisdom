I am performing Homam in Ki=\r\ntchen of my rented flat. It has a &#39;Hood&#39; above cooking range area. and a sm=\r\nall Exhaust fan as well.\n\nKitchen is fitted with &#39;Heat cum Gas Detector&#39;. I=\r\n believe that Homa fire will not be stronger then heavy cooking. One more a=\r\ndvantage is there when you seat on the floor of the kitchen for doing Homam=\r\n. The fire in Homa kunda will be farther away from the Heat detector.\n\nI ke=\r\nep Exhaust fan On during the entire homa session. start hood only when the =\r\nfire extinguishes and more smoke start coming out. I also experimented once=\r\n by keeping Exhaust Fan off (Hood also off) and that too was also safe. The=\r\n Fire alarm did not trigger.\n\nIn your case, if you have a &#39;Hood&#39; and Exhaus=\r\nt fan arrangement then it would be quite safer to do the homa in the kitche=\r\nn sitting on the floor.\n\nIf you have a `smoke detector&#39; (Which is generally=\r\n not the case in kitchen) then you may think of covering it with some plast=\r\nic bag or such things during homam.\n\nHipe this helps.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal=\r\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shankar789&quot; &lt;shankar789@...&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt;\n&gt; To the attention of US based friends, who stay in rented apartments\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks to Ms. Padmaja and Mr. Ravi for advising where to =\r\npurchase havan kund.\n&gt; \n&gt; I stay in a rented apartment.

Get two to four bricks (concrete =\r\nor regular). Arrange the bricks on the floor, preferably on a 2ft by 2ft wo=\r\noden plank wrapped with aluminium foil. Make sure you spread out the bricks=\r\n, do not put them closer. Put the hawan kund on the bricks and make sure th=\r\ne hawan kund is stable.\n&gt; &gt;      In the Mahagapathi homam video at http://w=\r\nww.vedicastrologer.org/homam/ganapathi.htm, you can see couple of concrete =\r\nbricks underneath the hawan kund that were put on the floor. Wooden plank w=\r\nith aluminium foil helps in cleaning the mess after every couple of weeks i=\r\nf you are doing homam daily.\n&gt; &gt;      You can get a wooden spoon at a store=\r\n like Walmart in US.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; Ravi\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ________________=\r\n________________\n&gt; &gt; From: Padmaja Bandaru &lt;padmajab@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom=\r\n@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, April 30, 2009 10:36:21 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject=\r\n: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Havan Kund\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; H=\r\nere are the websites for agnihotra supplies \n&gt; &gt; http://www.agnihotr asuppl=\r\nies. com/\n&gt; &gt; http://www.homastore.com/\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Padmaja\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 4/30/09, shankar789 &lt;shankar789@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: shankar789 &lt;shankar789@yahoo. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wi=\r\nsdom] Re: Havan Kund\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Thurs=\r\nday, April 30, 2009, 6:54 PM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Friends,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am t=\r\nrying to purchase the havan kund from the following online store, but they =\r\ndont sell &#39;stand&#39; for keeping the havan kund. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I live in a rented =\r\napartment which has carpet floor.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One suggestion was to purchase a=\r\n concrete slab from Home depot and place the havan kund. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The onli=\r\nne shop people also advised me that they would try to get havan kund with s=\r\ntand, as a special case but it can take few months. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am eager to=\r\n find out how our US friends are performing homa in their residences?\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Another point is that, these people do not sell wooden spoons and they =\r\nare offering copper spoons for ahuti.
