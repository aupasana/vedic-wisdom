The human b=\r\nody is the best Yantra one could hope for .External Yantras no doubt might =\r\nbe powerful but somebody equally powerful has to consecrate them beforehand=\r\n and it will revert most people to square one. \n\nNarasimha ji answered the =\r\nearlier question that was raised about placing beeja akshara&#39;s at various p=\r\nlaces in one&#39;s body. One would have to visualize the subtle body and then k=\r\nnow the procedure of placing the aksharas in whatever form there.\n\nAgain mo=\r\nst yantras sold nowadays are just Placebo&#39;s marketed cleverly.The power of =\r\nan yantra lies both in the geometry and the consecration process, any imper=\r\nfections in the shapes and material will render it useless and in some marg=\r\ninal cases will cause it to invite non benefic energies.\n\nOne can definetly=\r\n learn to draw the Sri Chakra.Sri Amritananda Natha ( Seer behind the Roche=\r\nster devi temple and head of Devipuram centre ) has put together a beautifu=\r\nl ppt on how to do it using a simple compass and ruler. The process of draw=\r\ning the Sri chakra itself is supposed to work like a chisel on one&#39;s consci=\r\nousness and cause eventual purification.\n\nhttp://devipuram.com/downloads/ca=\r\ntalog1.html\n\nPlease see the link &quot;how to draw sri chakra &quot;.\n\nThat drawing c=\r\nan serve as one&#39;s 2D personal yantra. Sri Meru would be the 3D representati=\r\non. The intersections of the triangles are mapped in theory to crucial 64 n=\r\nadi junctions in the human body with the energies being the ruling deities =\r\nof the body and cosmos.\n\n\nMantra ,Yantra,Homa ,Vigraha Pratishta all of the=\r\nm are made alive only by emotion and the earnestness with which the sadhaka=\r\n calls the diety.\n\nNarasimha ji is right when he says all that matters is j=\r\nust doing what one knows and submitting like a child to the mother and not =\r\nworry about specific sadhanas.\n\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n\n\n--- In ved=\r\nic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On the to=\r\npic of Yantras, I have a few questions. Is there a way we can create our ow=\r\nn yantras? Are people aware of any writing instruments on copper plates tha=\r\nt we, as end users can use, instead of going to a special store? The reason=\r\n I ask this is, people sell all kinds of yantras these days, in yantra fact=\r\nories and sell them on internet, which in past Shri Narasimha mentioned. An=\r\nd he did dismiss them as not too useful things for sadhana. In this group, =\r\nall of us do involve in some kind of sadhana with a sincere approach, in my=\r\n opinion. So, in my opinion if we can create our own yantras, that would be=\r\n a lot better than any ready made stuff available on the net.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Na=\r\ngraj\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Tue, 2/8/11, Kishore Chitrapu &lt;chitrapu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; From: Kishore Chitrapu &lt;chitrapu@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: D=\r\nrawing Yantra for Homam\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Tuesday,=\r\n February 8, 2011, 1:29 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste KK,\n&gt; \n&gt; Robe=\r\nrt Svoboda in &quot;Kundalini&quot; book listed quite a few yantras and their intende=\r\nd purposes\n&gt; in the second chapter.

Or you can also dra=\r\nw a more elaborate yantra with kumkum at the \n&gt; &gt; base of the=C3=82=C2=A0ku=\r\nnda. If you are using=C3=82=C2=A0yantra, then it is best to use the right \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; yantra for the specific deity. Or else it may not have any perceivable=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0effect. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; At a basic level one can use a simple=\r\n upward pointed triangle for any male deity \n&gt; &gt; and a downward pointed one=\r\n for a female deity. Make it using 9 sticks. 3 on each \n&gt; &gt; side. Another s=\r\nimple yantra is to make a 6 pointed star with 12 sticks.=C3=82=C2=A0A base =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; triangle with an inverted triangle on top, repeated again. (3 x 4 =\r\n=3D 12).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Fire itself is very powerful. Without a yantra too it wor=\r\nks fine (my=C3=82=C2=A0personal \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; opinion). To be able to really use =\r\nthe yantra as a prop to invoke the deity, one \n&gt; &gt; must=C3=82=C2=A0be suffi=\r\nciently engaged in using the yantra for=C3=82=C2=A0years.
