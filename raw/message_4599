This is what we feel when Ramani Ammal walks past us at Sri\nRamanas=\r\nramam. The spiritual aspirations which consumed her since her\nchildhood hav=\r\ne blossomed into a graceful flower of virtue and self poise. In\nthis interv=\r\niew, videotaped in December of 1989, she briefly told us her life\nstory.\n\nQ=\r\nuestioner: Please tell us about how you first came to Ramanasramam.\n\nRamani=\r\n Ammal: My chosen deity in childhood was Lord Krishna. From my youth I\nhad =\r\nvery pleasant dreams and would sometimes see Lord Krishna or other\nfamiliar=\r\n deities in these dreams. But at the age of sixteen or seventeen I\nonce saw=\r\n a strange sage-like person coming down a hill and was captivated by\nhis gr=\r\nandeur. I later came to realize that this sage was Sri Bhagavan.\n\nAfter hav=\r\ning that vision of Bhagavan in my dream, a certain fear that had\ngripped me=\r\n for some time all of a sudden disappeared. My relatives and\nothers noticed=\r\n this and commented how I was now moving about freely. This\nwas Bhagavan&#39;s =\r\nfirst influence on me.\n\nAlso, at the age of sixteen I was reading the Jnana=\r\n Vasishta. While reading\nit I experienced that I was enveloped in jyoti, a =\r\nbright white light. I\nthought that if this is what happens just by reading =\r\nit, how much more\nwonderful would it be if we practised dhyana and the othe=\r\nr spiritual\ninjunctions taught in the book. I used to be thrilled simply by=\r\n reading\nthose ancient Tamil scriptures. But it wasn&#39;t until I was twenty b=\r\nefore I\ngot hold of a book on Bhagavan.\n\nKumaraswami Raja, the Chief Minist=\r\ner of Madras, who was a cousin of mine,\nbrought me Bharati&#39;s biography of B=\r\nhagavan, Ramana Vijayam, in 1946. Mrs.\nKumaraswami Raja was very fond of me=\r\n, and though other relatives prohibited\nme from reading spiritual books, sh=\r\ne used to stealthily supply me with them.\nThe day she sent this book over w=\r\nith a boy, I was sitting in the house with\na friend, a headmistress, who th=\r\nough Christian, was sincerely interested in\nour religion.\n\nThe boy who brou=\r\nght the book said, &quot;Mami said to hand this book to you.&quot; I\ngot up and went =\r\nup to the gate to receive it. The moment I touched the book\nI lost body con=\r\nsciousness. My whole body became stiff. I somehow managed to\nreturn and sit=\r\n next to my friend. Noticing my plight, she commented that I\nshouldn&#39;t read=\r\n such books that make me forget myself. Everyone was\ncomplaining about this=\r\n same thing, for in those days most of the time I\nwould be sitting quietly,=\r\n alert to my spiritual aspirations. All thought\nthat I was simply idle with=\r\n no work to do.\n\nWith difficulty I opened Ramana Vijayam to the first page =\r\nand was met by the\nphoto of the young Ramana. I became speechless. My frien=\r\nd, who was somewhat\nalarmed at my condition, had to leave and I somehow saw=\r\n her off. With great\nreverence I took the book and started reading it. As I=\r\n read, my eyes kept\nclosing involuntarily, and I was drawn within, which I =\r\nlater came to know\nwas meditation. Bhagavan taught me meditation in this wa=\r\ny.\n\nAfter reading this book, I felt I should leave home and go meet Ramana\n=\r\nMaharshi. It is my family custom that women never even leave the house, not=\r\n\nto mention leaving the town. That vairagya, or desperate determination to\n=\r\nleave my house for spiritual fulfilment, was implanted in me by this book;\n=\r\nand I am sure it was by the direct influence of Sri Bhagavan himself.\n\nBeca=\r\nuse of my intense desire to go and see Bhagavan, my younger brother was\nmov=\r\ned to help me. He is a very pious person, with a soft nature. With his\nhelp=\r\n I secretly left home and reached Tiruvannamalai and the holy feet of\nSri B=\r\nhagavan. But after reaching there, I was overcome with a sense of guilt\nfor=\r\n running away from home. This feeling of guilt, and a sense of bringing\nill=\r\n fame to the respected Rajagopalan family, was uppermost in my mind when\nI =\r\nfirst came into Bhagavan&#39;s presence. I felt depressed because of this.\n\nWhe=\r\nn I arrived I went to the office to inquire where Bhagavan was. I was\ntold =\r\nthat Bhagavan was near the well. When I came near the well, I saw a\nthatche=\r\nd shed next to it and all I could see in it was a flaming fire. I\nthought t=\r\no myself, &quot;I asked for directions to go to Bhagavan and they have\nsent me t=\r\no a sacrificial place where there is a fire.&quot; It was only after a\nfew minut=\r\nes that I saw Bhagavan&#39;s comely form emerge from those flames. Even\nwhen I =\r\nhad the Jyoti Darshana I was blaming myself, thinking that I had this\ndelus=\r\nion of seeing a fire instead of Bhagavan because I was foolish enough\nto co=\r\nme out into the hot sun. It was only afterwards I realized Bhagavan had\nbes=\r\ntowed upon me this great boon of Jyoti Darshana. Next I heard Bhagavan\nsayi=\r\nng to me, &quot;You have now come home. Why don&#39;t you sit down?&quot;\n\nComing from a =\r\nfamily where women never go out, and having never gone out\nmyself, I did no=\r\nt know how to behave in company. When Bhagavan said &quot;You\nhave now come home=\r\n. You can sit down,&quot; I sat down right in front of him and\nnot in the place =\r\nreserved for women. For three days I kept sitting in front\nof him and all t=\r\nhe while the feeling of guilt for running away from home was\nhaunting me. I=\r\n kept sitting in front of Bhagavan, not knowing how to act or\nask questions=\r\n, or anything else.\n\nOn the third day I heard Bhagavan telling someone: &quot;I =\r\nalso ran away from my\nhome, and at the railroad station I was so frightened=\r\n that anyone could have\nidentified me as a runaway, caught hold of me and s=\r\nent me home. I ran away\nlike a thief.&quot; When Bhagavan narrated this, it comp=\r\nletely wiped out all my\nguilt feelings from that moment onwards. This was a=\r\nn act of pure grace\ndirected towards me. It is very strange that by those f=\r\new words Bhagavan\nentirely removed any residual fear in me. Bhagavan later =\r\nsaid that sometimes\nyou have to do a wrong thing to achieve the ultimate ri=\r\nght thing. He even\ncommented that there is nothing wrong in a woman running=\r\n away at the tender\nage of twenty to come here.\n\nI should narrate how my fi=\r\nrst Giri Pradakshina took place. I was not\naccustomed to walking at all, bu=\r\nt whenever people came to tell Bhagavan that\nthey were going on a Giri Prad=\r\nakshina, I longed to go too. One day\nVenkataramayya and others were going r=\r\nound the hill, and in this group there\nwere two devotees who were over eigh=\r\nty years old. I did not say anything to\nBhagavan, but was all the time pray=\r\ning that I should be included in that\nparty. Immediately Bhagavan said to V=\r\nenkataramayya &quot;Take this girl - the one\nseated there - with you.&quot; Bhagavan =\r\ndidn&#39;t stop there, for he even said, &quot;She\nwill walk very slowly. Will that =\r\nbe all right?&quot; Then Bhagavan turned towards\nme and said, &quot;These are our own=\r\n people. Are you prepared to go with them?&quot;\nLooking at me, he simply said, =\r\n&quot;Go!&quot;\n\nThe Pradakshina took almost six hours. At Adi Annamalai I could move=\r\n no\nmore. I requested the group to proceed without me, and told them I will=\r\n\nreach the Ashram later. But they said, &quot;How could we leave you when Bhagav=\r\nan\nentrusted you to us? Even if it takes you another day to complete the\nPr=\r\nadakshina, we will stay with you. Only with you can we re-enter the\nAshram.=\r\n&quot;\n\nI was again feeling very guilty when we finally arrived. I was thinking =\r\nthat\nothers take three to four hours to complete the Pradakshina and I have=\r\n taken\nsix hours, wasting not only my time, but theirs too. I felt that the=\r\ny were\nall older than me, and a younger person, like me, had caused them so=\r\n much\ninconvenience. When I entered the Ashram my heart was heavy with this=\r\n\nfeeling. With great difficulty we entered into the presence of Bhagavan an=\r\nd\nas soon as I sat down, Bhagavan started narrating how the Pradakshina sho=\r\nuld\nbe done by walking as slow as a royal queen in her ninth month of pregn=\r\nancy.\n&quot;So there is nothing wrong in what she did,&quot; he concluded. After this=\r\n, many\ntimes I used to go around the hill all alone.\n\nI used to fast a lot =\r\nin those days - almost fifteen days out of a month. It\nwas helping in my sa=\r\ndhana. One day, with the permission of Chinnaswami, I\nstayed in the Ashram =\r\ntill 7:30 p.m., which is the supper time. Bhagavan\nturned to me and said, &quot;=\r\nAren&#39;t you coming for supper?&quot; Then he said,\n&quot;Sattvic food should be eaten.=\r\n There is no meaning in mere fasting.&quot; Since\nthen I stopped fasting. Even i=\r\nf I wanted to fast, for some reason or other\nit would be broken. That is a =\r\nreal wonder to me.\n\nI was not aware of this Brahmin-non-Brahmin separation =\r\nin the Dining Hall.\nOne day I entered and saw the screen dividing the seati=\r\nng area. Some people\nwere already seated. I was in a fix as to where I shou=\r\nld sit. Bhagavan saw\nmy plight and asked me to sit right next to him. He sa=\r\nid to an attendant,\n&quot;She doesn&#39;t know anything, so put her leaf here.&quot; Then=\r\n he said to me,\n&quot;Don&#39;t worry about these Brahmins.&quot; That is how Bhagavan in=\r\n his kindness\nused to take care of me, for I was all alone and ignorant of =\r\nthe customs and\nways of the world. Since Bhagavan was showering all this pe=\r\nrsonal attention\non me, Chinnaswami also took a personal interest in my wel=\r\nfare. As Muruganar\nwas away, Chinnaswami offered me his residence to stay i=\r\nn, and also offered\nto send someone to guard me. I told him that I was not =\r\nafraid and would lock\nthe house from inside and needed no one to guard me. =\r\nBhagavan overheard this\nand said, &quot;She is a young girl, and does not know t=\r\nhe consequences. Let her\nsleep indoors, behind closed doors, but you send a=\r\n servant to sleep outside\non the verandah.&quot; I did not know anything when I =\r\ncame here. Even cooking I\nlearned here and, of course, Bhagavan taught me m=\r\nany things from within.\n\nInterviewer: Since you used to sit in front of Bha=\r\ngavan quite often, could\nyou please give a detailed description of what is =\r\ncalled &#39;Bhagavan&#39;s Glance\nof Grace?&#39;\n\nRamani Ammal: Bhagavan&#39;s look was rea=\r\nl magic. You could not do anything but\njust look into his eyes, which would=\r\n transform you into Samadhi. Everyone in\nthe hall used to feel Bhagavan was=\r\n looking at them alone. This was the true\nexperience of each one of us. In =\r\nhis inimitable way he was giving the glance\nof grace to each and everyone s=\r\neated in the hall. Bhagavan&#39;s look used to\ntake us deep into Samadhi. Just =\r\nby looking into his eyes, we came to know\nwhat meditation is. This was, and=\r\n is, the common experience of all devotees.\nYou ask anyone and you will get=\r\n the same reply.\n\nOnce he gave me such a look and for a very long time I wa=\r\ns absorbed in\nSamadhi. Bhagavan was reading the newspaper, letters were bei=\r\nng brought in,\nnormal activity was going on, but I was oblivious of the hap=\r\npenings outside\nof me. In fact, I was unaware of my body.\n\nI once remember =\r\na Harijan lady who for the past twenty-five years was\ngathering honey to se=\r\nnd to Sri Bhagavan. On every occasion she was unable to\nbring the honey her=\r\nself and had to send it with someone. After waiting for\ntwenty-five years, =\r\nshe finally found the opportunity to come. The poor lady\nwas in tattered cl=\r\nothes, standing before Bhagavan. Her eyesight was poor and\nI still vividly =\r\nrecall the unusual way she looked at Sri Bhagavan, calling\nout &quot;Oh Darling,=\r\n where are you? I want to see you.&quot; Bhagavan in all his\ngraciousness said, =\r\n&quot;Granny, look this way. I am here.&quot; Looking at the honey\nshe had brought wi=\r\nth her, he said to me, &quot;They are Brahmins, they won&#39;t eat\nthis. We will sha=\r\nre it, and eat it.&quot;\n\nIt is often said, Bhagavan did not give direct Upadesa=\r\n, but what else is all\nthis? Although Bhagavan repeatedly pointed out human=\r\n frailty, people were\nnot prepared to rectify themselves.\n\nAs if talking to=\r\n himself, he looked at this poor old woman in ragged clothes\nand said, &quot;Poo=\r\nr lady, she must be hungry. And where will she go for clothes?\nWho will off=\r\ner her food and clothes?&quot; Upon hearing this, Ondu Reddiyar got\nup and said,=\r\n &quot;We will give her food and also see that some clothes are\npurchased.&quot; Then=\r\n Reddiyar took the woman to the Dining Hall and fed her\nsumptuously. He als=\r\no sent someone to town to buy her a sari. As the old\nwoman had no money, sh=\r\ne had walked a great distance to come here. Bhagavan\nknowing this, said in =\r\nan impersonal way, &quot;Would anyone be interested in\ngetting her a bus ticket?=\r\n&quot; Reddiyar again came forward and said, &quot;We will\nprovide her with a bus tic=\r\nket and see her off.&quot; When this lady returned from\nthe Dining Hall she was =\r\ntouching the ground, and then touching her eyes.\nThat is a way of prostrati=\r\non and thanksgiving. It is noteworthy that\nwhenever the poor or untouchable=\r\ns came, Bhagavan took a very personal\ninterest in them, which was a moving =\r\nsight to see.\n\nSri Bhagavan had absolutely no connection with either body o=\r\nr mind. People\nused to be confused by seeing him read letters and newspaper=\r\ns. His inner\nstate never changed since he was sixteen. This was demonstrate=\r\nd repeatedly,\nbut only those who had the eyes to see, could see and realize=\r\n it. Sri\nBhagavan was also a real taskmaster. He used to quietly move aroun=\r\nd to\nvarious places within the Ashram without notice. So every place had to=\r\n be\nkept clean and neat because Bhagavan was very particular about cleanlin=\r\ness.\nHe was also particular about punctuality. This kept every member of th=\r\ne\nAshram alert and on their toes, ready at all times to do what was necessa=\r\nry.\nLook how this Ashram has grown. Unless Bhagavan was very careful in his=\r\n\nsilent supervision, could it have grown to this extent?\n\nQuestioner: Where=\r\n were you at the time of Sri Bhagavan&#39;s Mahanirvana?\n\nRamani Ammal: I was a=\r\nt Rajapalayam. That night I saw a blue light\nbeautifully rising up into the=\r\n sky. I knew Bhagavan had left the body. I\nfelt that I did not want to live=\r\n after that and started a fast. By fasting I\nwanted to drop the body. After=\r\n five or six days of not touching food I had\nseveral visions. In one of the=\r\nm I was taken inside the Arunachala Hill and\nsaw there rishis performing ya=\r\ngnas and yoga. I also saw Sri Bhagavan seated\nthere. Some munis or rishis o=\r\nffered some prasad to Bhagavan. Then Sri\nBhagavan himself gave it to me, an=\r\nd I was made to eat. I remembered that I\nwas fasting, but couldn&#39;t refuse B=\r\nhagavan&#39;s prasad. How can I say that it\nwas a dream? I consider it was Bhag=\r\navan&#39;s grace alone. He also said to me,\n&quot;You say and repeat &#39;I have gone aw=\r\nay, I have gone away&#39;. Where have I gone?\nI am right here. You are not look=\r\ning inward. If you look within, I am\nthere.&quot; For many days afterwards the s=\r\nmell of that prasad lingered. The\naroma even spread all through the house. =\r\nMy brother and sisters kept talking\nabout it. When I was fasting, my brothe=\r\nr and sister were also fasting with\nme. The morning following that vision w=\r\ne started taking food again.\n\nIn the dream I also remember Bhagavan was sea=\r\nted near a tank and rishis and\nmunis were serving him. He looked splendid, =\r\ngracious, magnanimous, and\nmagnificent. It was a beautiful sight. I saw the=\r\nre Kamadhenu, the celestial\ncow, the celestial tree, and many other wonderf=\r\nul things. It was a divine\nsight indeed. From that day onwards I had no tho=\r\nught at all that Bhagavan\nhad left us. He is all pervading, and I experienc=\r\ned him particularly in my\nheart. I no longer felt sorrow. He is even here n=\r\now.\n\nWhen I came again to Tiruvannamalai I was filled with bliss. You can f=\r\neel\nBhagavan&#39;s presence every minute. Right this very minute I feel his Div=\r\nine\nPresence. I have no unhappiness. I am happy all the time. Sri Bhagavan&#39;=\r\ns\nPresence is so overpowering. See how we all are gathered here. What have =\r\nwe\ndone to deserve this?\n\nInterviewer: To my knowledge I haven&#39;t done anyth=\r\ning good and I also wonder,\nalong with you, how Bhagavan has gathered us he=\r\nre.\n\nRamani Ammal: I can&#39;t say that I have ever done anything bad. From my\n=\r\nchildhood I didn&#39;t know what is good and what is bad either. But doing good=\r\n\nor bad has nothing to do with our coming to Bhagavan&#39;s Presence. It is onl=\r\ny\nby his grace that we are filled with his glorious Presence.\n\n[We extend o=\r\nur warm appreciation to J.

The=\r\n day she sent this book over with a boy, I was sitting in the house with a =\r\nfriend, a headmistress, who though Christian, was sincerely interested in o=\r\nur religion.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The boy who brought the book said, &quot;Mami said to=\r\n hand this book to you.&quot; I got up and went up to the gate to receive i=\r\nt. The moment I touched the book I lost body consciousness. My whole body b=\r\necame stiff. I somehow managed to return and sit next to my friend. Noticin=\r\ng my plight, she commented that I shouldn&#39;t read such books that make m=\r\ne forget myself. Everyone was complaining about this same thing, for in tho=\r\nse days most of the time I would be sitting quietly, alert to my spiritual =\r\naspirations. All thought that I was simply idle with no work to do.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;With difficulty I opened Ramana Vijayam to the first page and was met by =\r\nthe photo of the young Ramana. I became speechless. My friend, who was some=\r\nwhat alarmed at my condition, had to leave and I somehow saw her off. With =\r\ngreat reverence I took the book and started reading it. As I read, my eyes =\r\nkept closing involuntarily, and I was drawn within, which I later came to k=\r\nnow was meditation. Bhagavan taught me meditation in this way.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;sp=\r\nan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;After reading this book, I felt I should leav=\r\ne home and go meet Ramana Maharshi. It is my family custom that women never=\r\n even leave the house, not to mention leaving the town. That vairagya, or d=\r\nesperate determination to leave my house for spiritual fulfilment, was impl=\r\nanted in me by this book; and I am sure it was by the direct influence of S=\r\nri Bhagavan himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Because of my intense desire to go and=\r\n see Bhagavan, my younger brother was moved to help me. He is a very pious =\r\nperson, with a soft nature. With his help I secretly left home and reached =\r\nTiruvannamalai and the holy feet of Sri Bhagavan. But after reaching there,=\r\n I was overcome with a sense of guilt for running away from home. This feel=\r\ning of guilt, and a sense of bringing ill fame to the respected Rajagopalan=\r\n family, was uppermost in my mind when I first came into Bhagavan&#39;s pre=\r\nsence. I felt depressed because of this.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;When I arrived I went to =\r\nthe office to inquire where Bhagavan was. I was told that Bhagavan was near=\r\n the well. When I came near the well, I saw a thatched shed next to it and =\r\nall I could see in it was a flaming fire. I thought to myself, &quot;I aske=\r\nd for directions to go to Bhagavan and they have sent me to a sacrificial p=\r\nlace where there is a fire.&quot; It was only after a few minutes that I sa=\r\nw Bhagavan&#39;s comely form emerge from those flames. Even when I had the =\r\nJyoti Darshana I was blaming myself, thinking that I had this delusion of s=\r\neeing a fire instead of Bhagavan because I was foolish enough to come out i=\r\nnto the hot sun. It was only afterwards I realized Bhagavan had bestowed up=\r\non me this great boon of Jyoti Darshana. Next I heard Bhagavan saying to me=\r\n, &quot;You have now come home. Why don&#39;t you sit down?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\nComing from a family where women never go out, and having never gone out my=\r\nself, I did not know how to behave in company. When Bhagavan said &quot;You=\r\n have now come home. You can sit down,&quot; I sat down right in front of h=\r\nim and not in the place reserved for women. For three days I kept sitting i=\r\nn front of him and all the while the feeling of guilt for running away from=\r\n home was haunting me. I kept sitting in front of Bhagavan, not knowing how=\r\n to act or ask questions, or anything else.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-we=\r\night:bold&quot;&gt;On the third day I heard Bhagavan telling someone: &quot;I also =\r\nran away from my home, and at the railroad station I was so frightened that=\r\n anyone could have identified me as a runaway, caught hold of me and sent m=\r\ne home. I ran away like a thief.&quot; When Bhagavan narrated this, it comp=\r\nletely wiped out all my guilt feelings from that moment onwards. This was a=\r\nn act of pure grace directed towards me. It is very strange that by those f=\r\new words Bhagavan entirely removed any residual fear in me. Bhagavan later =\r\nsaid that sometimes you have to do a wrong thing to achieve the ultimate ri=\r\nght thing. He even commented that there is nothing wrong in a woman running=\r\n away at the tender age of twenty to come here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;I should na=\r\nrrate how my first Giri Pradakshina took place. I was not accustomed to wal=\r\nking at all, but whenever people came to tell Bhagavan that they were going=\r\n on a Giri Pradakshina, I longed to go too. One day Venkataramayya and othe=\r\nrs were going round the hill, and in this group there were two devotees who=\r\n were over eighty years old. I did not say anything to Bhagavan, but was al=\r\nl the time praying that I should be included in that party. Immediately Bha=\r\ngavan said to Venkataramayya &quot;Take this girl - the one seated there - =\r\nwith you.&quot; Bhagavan didn&#39;t stop there, for he even said, &quot;She=\r\n will walk very slowly. Will that be all right?&quot; Then Bhagavan turned =\r\ntowards me and said, &quot;These are our own people. Are you prepared to go=\r\n with them?&quot; Looking at me, he simply said, &quot;Go!&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;T=\r\nhe Pradakshina took almost six hours. At Adi Annamalai I could move no more=\r\n. I requested the group to proceed without me, and told them I will reach t=\r\nhe Ashram later. But they said, &quot;How could we leave you when Bhagavan =\r\nentrusted you to us? Even if it takes you another day to complete the Prada=\r\nkshina, we will stay with you. Only with you can we re-enter the Ashram.&qu=\r\not;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;I was again feeling very gui=\r\nlty when we finally arrived. I was thinking that others take three to four =\r\nhours to complete the Pradakshina and I have taken six hours, wasting not o=\r\nnly my time, but theirs too. I felt that they were all older than me, and a=\r\n younger person, like me, had caused them so much inconvenience. When I ent=\r\nered the Ashram my heart was heavy with this feeling. With great difficulty=\r\n we entered into the presence of Bhagavan and as soon as I sat down, Bhagav=\r\nan started narrating how the Pradakshina should be done by walking as slow =\r\nas a royal queen in her ninth month of pregnancy. &quot;So there is nothing=\r\n wrong in what she did,&quot; he concluded. After this, many times I used t=\r\no go around the hill all alone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;I used to fast a lot in tho=\r\nse days - almost fifteen days out of a month. It was helping in my sadhana.=\r\n One day, with the permission of Chinnaswami, I stayed in the Ashram till 7=\r\n:30 p.m., which is the supper time.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;B=\r\nhagavan turned to me and said, &quot;Aren&#39;t you coming for supper?&quot=\r\n; Then he said, &quot;Sattvic food should be eaten. There is no meaning in =\r\nmere fasting.&quot; Since then I stopped fasting.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0Even if I wan=\r\nted to fast, for some reason or other it would be broken. That is a real wo=\r\nnder to me.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;I was not aware of this Brahmin-non-Brahmin separation=\r\n in the Dining Hall. One day I entered and saw the screen dividing the seat=\r\ning area. Some people were already seated. I was in a fix as to where I sho=\r\nuld sit. Bhagavan saw my plight and asked me to sit right next to him. He s=\r\naid to an attendant, &quot;She doesn&#39;t know anything, so put her leaf h=\r\nere.&quot; Then he said to me, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about these Brahmins.&=\r\nquot; That is how Bhagavan in his kindness used to take care of me, for I w=\r\nas all alone and ignorant of the customs and ways of the world. Since Bhaga=\r\nvan was showering all this personal attention on me, Chinnaswami also took =\r\na personal interest in my welfare. As Muruganar was away, Chinnaswami offer=\r\ned me his residence to stay in, and also offered to send someone to guard m=\r\ne. I told him that I was not afraid and would lock the house from inside an=\r\nd needed no one to guard me. Bhagavan overheard this and said, &quot;She is=\r\n a young girl, and does not know the consequences. Let her sleep indoors, b=\r\nehind closed doors, but you send a servant to sleep outside on the verandah=\r\n.&quot; I did not know anything when I came here. Even cooking I learned he=\r\nre and, of course, Bhagavan taught me many things from within.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Int=\r\nerviewer: Since you used to sit in front of Bhagavan quite often, could you=\r\n please give a detailed description of what is called &#39;Bhagavan&#39;s G=\r\nlance of Grace?&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ramani Ammal: Bhagavan&#39;s look was real magi=\r\nc. You could not do anything but just look into his eyes, which would trans=\r\nform you into Samadhi. Everyone in the hall used to feel Bhagavan was looki=\r\nng at them alone. This was the true experience of each one of us. In his in=\r\nimitable way he was giving the glance of grace to each and everyone seated =\r\nin the hall. Bhagavan&#39;s look used to take us deep into Samadhi. Just by=\r\n looking into his eyes, we came to know what meditation is. This was, and i=\r\ns, the common experience of all devotees. You ask anyone and you will get t=\r\nhe same reply.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Once he gave me such a look and for a very long tim=\r\ne I was absorbed in Samadhi. Bhagavan was reading the newspaper, letters we=\r\nre being brought in, normal activity was going on, but I was oblivious of t=\r\nhe happenings outside of me. In fact, I was unaware of my body.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;I =\r\nonce remember a Harijan lady who for the past twenty-five years was gatheri=\r\nng honey to send to Sri Bhagavan. On every occasion she was unable to bring=\r\n the honey herself and had to send it with someone. After waiting for twent=\r\ny-five years, she finally found the opportunity to come. The poor lady was =\r\nin tattered clothes, standing before Bhagavan. Her eyesight was poor and I =\r\nstill vividly recall the unusual way she looked at Sri Bhagavan, calling ou=\r\nt &quot;Oh Darling, where are you? I want to see you.&quot; Bhagavan in all=\r\n his graciousness said, &quot;Granny, look this way. I am here.&quot; Looki=\r\nng at the honey she had brought with her, he said to me, &quot;They are Bra=\r\nhmins, they won&#39;t eat this. We will share it, and eat it.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;It is often said, Bhagavan did not give direct Upadesa, but what else is =\r\nall this? Although Bhagavan repeatedly pointed out human frailty, people we=\r\nre not prepared to rectify themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As if talking to himself, he =\r\nlooked at this poor old woman in ragged clothes and said, &quot;Poor lady, =\r\nshe must be hungry. And where will she go for clothes? Who will offer her f=\r\nood and clothes?&quot; Upon hearing this, Ondu Reddiyar got up and said, &q=\r\nuot;We will give her food and also see that some clothes are purchased.&quo=\r\nt; Then Reddiyar took the woman to the Dining Hall and fed her sumptuously.=\r\n He also sent someone to town to buy her a sari. As the old woman had no mo=\r\nney, she had walked a great distance to come here. Bhagavan knowing this, s=\r\naid in an impersonal way, &quot;Would anyone be interested in getting her a=\r\n bus ticket?&quot; Reddiyar again came forward and said, &quot;We will prov=\r\nide her with a bus ticket and see her off.&quot; When this lady returned fr=\r\nom the Dining Hall she was touching the ground, and then touching her eyes.=\r\n That is a way of prostration and thanksgiving. It is noteworthy that whene=\r\nver the poor or untouchables came, Bhagavan took a very personal interest i=\r\nn them, which was a moving sight to see.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weigh=\r\nt:bold&quot;&gt;Sri Bhagavan had absolutely no connection with either body or mind.=\r\n People used to be confused by seeing him read letters and newspapers. His =\r\ninner state never changed since he was sixteen. This was demonstrated repea=\r\ntedly, but only those who had the eyes to see, could see and realize it.&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;=C2=A0Sri Bhagavan was also a real taskmaster. He used to quietly move =\r\naround to various places within the Ashram without notice. So every place h=\r\nad to be kept clean and neat because=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;=\r\nBhagavan was very particular about cleanliness. He was also particular abou=\r\nt punctuality.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0This kept every member of the Ashram alert and o=\r\nn their toes, ready at all times to do what was necessary. Look how this As=\r\nhram has grown. Unless Bhagavan was very careful in his silent supervision,=\r\n could it have grown to this extent?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Questioner: Where were you at=\r\n the time of Sri Bhagavan&#39;s Mahanirvana?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ramani Ammal: I was at =\r\nRajapalayam. That night I saw a blue light beautifully rising up into the s=\r\nky. I knew Bhagavan had left the body. I felt that I did not want to live a=\r\nfter that and started a fast. By fasting I wanted to drop the body. After f=\r\nive or six days of not touching food I had several visions. In one of them =\r\nI was taken inside the Arunachala Hill and saw there rishis performing yagn=\r\nas and yoga. I also saw Sri Bhagavan seated there. Some munis or rishis off=\r\nered some prasad to Bhagavan. Then Sri Bhagavan himself gave it to me, and =\r\nI was made to eat. I remembered that I was fasting, but couldn&#39;t refuse=\r\n Bhagavan&#39;s prasad. How can I say that it was a dream? I consider it wa=\r\ns Bhagavan&#39;s grace alone. He also said to me, &quot;You say and repeat =\r\n&#39;I have gone away, I have gone away&#39;. Where have I gone? I am right=\r\n here. You are not looking inward. If you look within, I am there.&quot; Fo=\r\nr many days afterwards the smell of that prasad lingered. The aroma even sp=\r\nread all through the house. My brother and sisters kept talking about it. W=\r\nhen I was fasting, my brother and sister were also fasting with me. The mor=\r\nning following that vision we started taking food again.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;In the dr=\r\neam I also remember Bhagavan was seated near a tank and rishis and munis we=\r\nre serving him. He looked splendid, gracious, magnanimous, and magnificent.=\r\n It was a beautiful sight. I saw there Kamadhenu, the celestial cow, the ce=\r\nlestial tree, and many other wonderful things. It was a divine sight indeed=\r\n. From that day onwards I had no thought at all that Bhagavan had left us. =\r\nHe is all pervading, and I experienced him particularly in my heart. I no l=\r\nonger felt sorrow. He is even here now.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;When I came again to Tiruv=\r\nannamalai I was filled with bliss. You can feel Bhagavan&#39;s presence eve=\r\nry minute. Right this very minute I feel his Divine Presence. I have no unh=\r\nappiness. I am happy all the time. Sri Bhagavan&#39;s Presence is so overpo=\r\nwering. See how we all are gathered here. What have we done to deserve this=\r\n?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Interviewer: To my knowledge I haven&#39;t done anything good an=\r\nd I also wonder, along with you, how Bhagavan has gathered us here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\nRamani Ammal: I can&#39;t say that I have ever done anything bad. From my c=\r\nhildhood I didn&#39;t know what is good and what is bad either. But doing g=\r\nood or bad has nothing to do with our coming to Bhagavan&#39;s Presence. It=\r\n is only by his grace that we are filled with his glorious Presence.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;[We extend our warm appreciation to J.=\r\n Jayaraman who was the Tamil interviewer, James Hartel who videotaped it, S=\r\nri V.
