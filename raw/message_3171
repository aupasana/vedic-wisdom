They actually match in most years.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Accor=\r\nding to the definition used today, Margasira month starts when Sun and Moon=\r\n conjoin in Vrischika raasi, i.e. Moon is in Vrischika raasi at the end of =\r\nAmaavaasyaa tithi when a new lunar month begins. If you look at the Pournim=\r\na of such a month in the last 3 years, Moon was indeed in Rohini/Mrigasira =\r\nor in Mrigasira/Aardra on the Pournima day. The standard definition results=\r\n in the same reckoning most of the times. This year happens to be a border =\r\nyear where the two definitions are mis-aligned by one month.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I believ=\r\ne the error in reckoning came in during the last millennium or so. The birt=\r\nh tithis of gods, rishis and yogis noted from the ancient times (e.g. Lord =\r\nRama&#39;s birth on Chaitra Sukla Navami, Dattatreya&#39;s birth on Margasira Pourn=\r\nima etc) must have been noted down using the &quot;correct definition&quot;. It is up=\r\nto us now to iron out the correct definition now.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Basically, what I mean is that, is there any way to know for sure\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; if today is the real Dattatreya Jayanti irrespective whatever name\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nwe set for the month?\n&gt;  \n&gt; I am afraid not, but a good question!\n&gt;  \n&gt; The=\r\nre is a different energy around us at different times. However, most of us =\r\nare not capable of identifying it. A yogi with zero ego and very pure consc=\r\niousness may be able to identify, but not others who see the world through =\r\nthe colors of their dense I-ness. How can one identify the color of an obje=\r\nct seen through a dark window accurately, when the window darkens everythin=\r\ng?\n&gt;  \n&gt; I was mentioning to a yogi some Rudrabhaishekas that were happenin=\r\ng here last month, on the occasion of Kaarthika month (supposed to be dear =\r\nto Shiva). He actually told me, &quot;Narasimha, this somehow does not *feel* to=\r\n me like Kaarthika month.

Is today really a Maargasira Pournima?\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; People name the lunar months these days based on the raasi occupie=\r\nd by Moon at the time of Sun-Moon conjunction, i.e. end of Amaavaasya. Sun-=\r\nMoon conjunction in Pisces begins Chaitra month, in Aries begins Vaisakha m=\r\nonth and so on. However, is this perfect or has an error been introduced in=\r\n the last few millennia due to deepening Kali?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; If you look at the=\r\n names of months themselves, they are based on the star on Pournima (Full M=\r\noon day). For example, Moon is in Pisces (Poorvabhadra 4th paadam, Uttarabh=\r\nadra, Revati) at the beginning of Chaitra month. But on the Pournima day th=\r\nat follows, he is in Chitra or its vicinity.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; It is likely that th=\r\ne zodiac was divided into 12 equal parts (not necessarily aligned with 12 r=\r\nasis) and the position occupied by Moon at Full Moon of a month determined =\r\nthe name of the month. These 12 months were then named based on a main star=\r\n in those 12 parts. Chitra star for Chaitra month, Visakha star for Vaisakh=\r\na month, Jyeshtha star for Jyeshtha month and so on. Aaswayuja, Kaarthika, =\r\nMaargasira and Pushya months are associated with Aswini, Krittika, Mrigasir=\r\na and Pushya stars respectively.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Though Dec 30/31, 2009 is suppos=\r\ned to be Pushya Pournima, Moon will be nowhere near Pushya star. He will in=\r\nstead be in Mrigasira and Aardra. That is likely to be the real Maargasira =\r\nPournima. Today is supposed to be Maargasira Pournima, but Moon is nowhere =\r\nnear Mrigasira. He is instead in Krittika for most of the day and in Rohini=\r\n in the evening. This is likely to be Kaarthika Pournima.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best re=\r\ngards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons,=\r\n Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and =\r\nPitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;                   http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt;   =\r\n   Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org \n&gt; &gt;      Spiri=\r\ntuality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt;   Jyotish writin=\r\ngs: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; &gt; ------------ -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Ori=\r\nginal Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; From: rajarshi nandy \n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoog=\r\nroups. com \n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, December 01, 2009 4:46 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedi=\r\nc-wisdom] Dattatreya Jayanti\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Happy and auspicious Dattatreya Jayan=\r\nti to everyone!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiv=\r\na Sutra\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
