In fact,=\r\n such a statement cannot be made about ANY mantra. To take things further, =\r\na sadhaka who is pure already may be able to go into samadhi just chanting =\r\na non-mantra like &quot;Matsyendranath ki jay ho&quot; or &quot;Jesus is the savior&quot;.\n \n(3=\r\n) I maintain that Kunjika stotra is a highly codified compendium of specifi=\r\nc sadhanas to get specific results from Chandipath. It was codified for a r=\r\neason and not everyone reading Kunjika stotra can get those results easily.=\r\n Moreover, these results can be gotten without Kunjika stotra also. So the =\r\nbottomline is that there is no need to be over-attached to Kunjika stotra.\n=\r\n \n(4) In general, the belief some people have that there is some &quot;secret ke=\r\ny&quot; they are missing and that is why they are not making material and spirit=\r\nual progress in their sadhana, is incorrect. If you are praying and nothing=\r\n is happening, it is most certainly not because you are missing a secret ke=\r\ny. It may be because you need more devotion. It may be because the amount o=\r\nf sadhana you are doing is not enough, as the karmas blocking you are reall=\r\ny big and need sadhana that is commensurate with them.\n \n(5) Hyperbole is a=\r\n famous (and common) figure of speech in Sanskrit writing. Instead of takin=\r\ng things literally, one needs to understand the true meaning and intent.\n \n=\r\n(6) Bottomline: If you like Chandipath alone, do it. If you like Chandipath=\r\n with Kunjika stotra, do it. If you like Kunjika stotra alone, do it (but i=\r\nt is a good idea to do Chandipath also). If you like something else, do it.=\r\n Instead of being dogmatic about what combination needs to be done, just do=\r\n something or the other and try to increase your devotion. Mantras, procedu=\r\nres and rituals are tools to increase the control over mind and devotion. I=\r\nf too much deliberation is blocking one from doing any mantra, procedure or=\r\n ritual, it is no good.\n \n*        *        *\n \nSomeone else wrote about th=\r\ne method of doing Chandipath. Kavacha, argala, keelaka, Raatri sooktam, nya=\r\nsas, moola mantra, 13 chapters of Saptashati, moola mantra, Devi sooktam, r=\r\nahasyas and Siddha Kunjika stotra is the normal order. If one is unable to =\r\ndo all this and wants to do just the 13 chapters, it is perfectly fine IMHO=\r\n. In fact, just doing one chapter (e.g. chapter 4 or 11) is also fine.\n \nBe=\r\nst regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jy=\r\notish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pi=\r\ntri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Film=\r\ns that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: ht=\r\ntp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://group=\r\ns.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------\n \n---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@....i=\r\nn&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear Nithin,\n&gt; \n&gt; kunjika goes a step further it is like a key=\r\n to unlock saptashati :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; I guess I still have to disagree with=C2=A0y=\r\nou.-:)\n&gt; \n&gt; One who has not=C2=A0mastered (mastering often means lifetimes)=\r\n=C2=A0sadhana of Chandipath \n&gt; and yet jumped into Kunjika will hardly gain=\r\n anything.

On the other=\r\n hand, a simple child who does not \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;consciously or explicitly try to g=\r\net the wealth of one&#39;s mother and only spends \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;time with mother e=\r\nxpressing love and respect from her may end up getting her \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;wealth whe=\r\nn she decides by herself to give.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; In fact, I suggest not b=\r\neing a son who looks to get mother&#39;s wealth by laying \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;hands on =\r\nher checkbook. Just cultivate love for mother and devote yourself to \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;her. A mother knows what to give and when.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Just chantin=\r\ng saptashati is quite useful.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasi=\r\nmha\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tar=\r\npana:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Films that make a diff=\r\nerence: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/g=\r\nroup/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------=\r\n------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; ---- shashi_nambisan &lt;shashin@&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Hi All,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I can see that there were some discussion on kunjika=\r\n stotram before\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; however can someone who has expertise in sanskrit=\r\n give exact meaning \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; of these snippets\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; These=\r\n are snippets from two slokas in Siddha Kunjika Stotram.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; 1.
