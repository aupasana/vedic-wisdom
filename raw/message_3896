I find it also =\r\nweird that people start a witch-hunt against Nityananda Swami for his sex s=\r\ncandal, but nothing of that sort happened when Sri Karunanidhi could public=\r\nly question the authenticity of the Ramayana and Rama as a God. \n=C2=A0\nI p=\r\nersonally had no clue who Nityananda Swami was till yesterday when the news=\r\n broke. He maybe genuine, he may not be. But how are we to judge that? Just=\r\n because he is caught having a sexual relation with someone, he suddenly be=\r\ncomes untouchable? In that case what about another very famous &#39;saint&#39; /&#39;gu=\r\nru&#39; in India, who is merely a product of calculated advertisements and inte=\r\nlligent PR machinery, which makes sure that at least 10/15 days in a month =\r\nhis quotes on every damn subject on the planet (and very shallow quotes if =\r\nyou ask me), or news related to him appears in the largest selling english =\r\ndaily in India?=C2=A0That is another level of cheating, in my opinion. Why =\r\ndon&#39;t I see people trying to witch-hunt such &#39;sadhus&#39;? Because Hindus are a=\r\n confused lot. \n=C2=A0\nAs Narasimha says, maybe this was needed for real Dh=\r\narma to come back.

I do not wish=\r\n to deviate the discussion but interesting piece of tidbit.Sun tv which bro=\r\nught out the clip is owned by dayanidhi maran brother of Karunanidhi ( Supr=\r\nemo DMK which is a carbon copy of Communist ideology) and in today&#39;s speech=\r\n he used the cover of this occasion to once again lash out at dharma.\n\nThe =\r\nsame Karunanidhi also lashed out at Kanchi Peethadhipathi when the fiasco w=\r\nas ongoing.

He also never encouraged one to turn a=\r\nway from sex.

What will be our condition if we were tested by The Mo=\r\nther? Period.\n&gt; \n&gt; ***\n&gt; You have passionately raised some questions in def=\r\nense and i find nothing wrong in it but One thing i wish to pin point and t=\r\nhat is the Pain of embarrassment such episodes gives to follower of Sanaata=\r\nn Dharma. There may not be anything wrong, if a Saadhu which is very popula=\r\nr on TV, Media and having a great many followers, enjoys sexual pleasures b=\r\nut at the same time he preaches the same and does not hide it. If someone p=\r\nreaches sublime knowledge and talk about Brahmacharya but if he/she does no=\r\nt admit own weakness, it is a gross.\n&gt; I whole heartedly respect Mahatma Ga=\r\nndhi in one sense. He was extremely truthful in his &#39;Satyana Prayogo&#39; about=\r\n his own weakness and his struggles on sexual matters. It is a rarest of ra=\r\nre frankness for a person of such a stature in society. He really was a Saa=\r\ndhu.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a big difference between fall of a Popular Spiritual Mas=\r\nter and a normal person. If Sri Sri Ravishankar didn&#39;t fare well in a debat=\r\ne against Zakir Naik, is a big embarrassment for us, then a (un)spectacular=\r\n fall of a popular Spiritual Master, in front of the whole world is even bi=\r\ngger pain and embarrassment. It is a bigger blow to faiths of general publi=\r\nc.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not specific on Satyananda here because i do not know if it is=\r\n really true.\n&gt; \n&gt; If the footage is right, then i fancy here that such sho=\r\ncks and shameful episodes are needed to steer clear Sanaatan Dharma. The Mo=\r\nther may be pushing such bitter pills so that corruption is finally control=\r\nled and reduced to very minimum.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Further, in this age of Kali the ka=\r\nrmas and rnas have become so &gt;twisted and \n&gt; \n&gt; You have spoken the truth. =\r\nThe world today is many times more tempting then say even 100 years back. I=\r\nt is better to be a married person (Even for a very elavated soul like Vive=\r\nkananda if comes back) and overcome the pleasure/pains of sexual desires.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Finally, i would say that its high time for Big names and even Bigger c=\r\nlaims Spiritual Masters start taking a leaf out of Vimalananda or Mahatma G=\r\nandhi&#39;s bold approach to the subject of physical and mental Sex (Which is *=\r\nOne of the* prilimianry steps in final Brahmacharya. )\n&gt; \n&gt; It reminds me o=\r\nf Sant Tukaaram&#39;s famous line\n&gt; &quot;Jaisa Bole Taisa Chale tyaachi Vandaavi Pa=\r\nule&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. =\r\ncom, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; I too believe we should give the benefit of doubt to Swami Nityananda.=\r\n There are some questions one has to ask here:\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; 1) How =\r\nreliable is vedio.

Let me add some more comments.Sri Karunanidhi was also the perso=\r\nn who asked, &quot;Which engineering college did Rama pass out from?&quot;. That is h=\r\norrible. I wonder if anyone in India has the guts to publicly come out and =\r\nask a similar kind of question about religious figures of the Abrahamic rel=\r\nigions. I find it also weird that people start a witch-hunt against Nityana=\r\nnda Swami for his sex scandal, but nothing of that sort happened when Sri K=\r\narunanidhi could publicly question the authenticity of the Ramayana and Ram=\r\na as a God. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I personally had no clue who Nity=\r\nananda Swami was till yesterday when the news broke. He maybe genuine, he m=\r\nay not be. But how are we to judge that? Just because he is caught having a=\r\n sexual relation with someone, he suddenly becomes untouchable? In that cas=\r\ne what about another very famous &#39;saint&#39; /&#39;guru&#39; in India, who is merely a =\r\nproduct of calculated advertisements and intelligent PR machinery, which ma=\r\nkes sure that at least 10/15 days in a month his quotes on every damn subje=\r\nct on the planet (and very shallow quotes if you ask me), or news related t=\r\no him appears in the largest selling english daily in India?&nbsp;That is a=\r\nnother level of cheating, in my opinion. Why don&#39;t I see people trying to w=\r\nitch-hunt such &#39;sadhus&#39;? Because Hindus are a confused lot. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;As Narasimha says, maybe this was needed for real Dharma to =\r\ncome back. In which case&nbsp;I sincrely&nbsp;pray to Ma Chamunda that she =\r\nthrows down some more of these money-making, platitude-mouthing, &#39;sadhus&#39;/&#39;=\r\ngurus&#39; from their lofty public pedestals.

I do not wish to deviate the discussion but interesting p=\r\niece of tidbit.Sun tv which brought out the clip is owned by dayanidhi mara=\r\nn brother of Karunanidhi ( Supremo DMK which is a carbon copy of Communist =\r\nideology) and in today&#39;s speech he used the cover of this occasion to once =\r\nagain lash out at dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The same Karunanidhi also lashed out at Ka=\r\nnchi Peethadhipathi when the fiasco was ongoing. Hindu newspaper which is p=\r\nraised by normal people as unbiased\n was writing articles every day with so=\r\n called details of misgivings at the ashram....Sense a pattern ...That is t=\r\nhe media war of modern India controlled by vested interests who would love =\r\nto see an hindu sanyasi get insulted.Also stakeholders in this drama are th=\r\ne missionary orgs.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2.In Nithyananda&#39; s defense he never said he was =\r\ngod . He also never encouraged one to turn away from sex. His advice was ve=\r\nry simple ...when in the physical act keep it physical.As long as fantasies=\r\n are not involved it does not become a addiction. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He could very wel=\r\nl be repaying a rna ...or might be involved in a sexual ritual. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Two=\r\n of his gurus were an old woman and a female tantrik which he mentions in h=\r\nis youtube video on divine consciousness and feminity.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3.Like Narasi=\r\nmha ji pointed out , he has a very good way of explaining higher level trut=\r\nhs.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What he did or did not do is only his karma alone .This does not=\r\n take away anything from his\n lectures or messages.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;and like Utpal j=\r\ni rightly pointed out...When we are prepared to sit on a high moral horse t=\r\no judge others...we better be prepared when the divine mother tests us.By j=\r\nuding we will incurr a share of the karma others committed and also will be=\r\n judged quite harshly when our turn comes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Regards&lt;BR&gt;Vemparla Ram K=\r\nishore &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc245.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?=\r\nto=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-w=\r\nisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt; wrote=\r\n:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste Rajarshi,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha aptly worte:=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;No matter how much one has read, no matter how much o=\r\nne has &gt;understood, no matter how much sadhana one has done, no matter h=\r\now &gt;many good karmas one has done, no matter what spiritual experiences =\r\n&gt;one had, no matter how blissful one feels during meditation or most &gt=\r\n;of the time, no matter how\n elevated one is spiritually, one can &gt;still=\r\n fall. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I learnt a very good thing today from Narasimha&#39;s =\r\nmessage.

There may not be anything wrong, if a Saadhu which is very =\r\npopular on TV, Media and having a great many followers, enjoys sexual pleas=\r\nures but at the same time he preaches the same and does not hide it. If som=\r\neone preaches sublime knowledge and talk about Brahmacharya but if he/she d=\r\noes not admit own weakness, it is a gross.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I whole heartedly respec=\r\nt Mahatma Gandhi in one sense. He was extremely truthful in his &#39;Satyana Pr=\r\nayogo&#39; about his own weakness and his struggles on sexual matters. It is a =\r\nrarest of rare\n frankness for a person of such a stature in society. He rea=\r\nlly was a Saadhu.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; There is a big difference between fall o=\r\nf a Popular Spiritual Master and a normal person. If Sri Sri Ravishankar di=\r\ndn&#39;t fare well in a debate against Zakir Naik, is a big embarrassment for u=\r\ns, then a (un)spectacular fall of a popular Spiritual Master, in front of t=\r\nhe whole world is even bigger pain and embarrassment. It is a bigger blow t=\r\no faiths of general public.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I am not specific on Satyanand=\r\na here because i do not know if it is really true.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If the =\r\nfootage is right, then i fancy here that such shocks and shameful episodes =\r\nare needed to steer clear Sanaatan Dharma. The Mother may be pushing such b=\r\nitter pills so that corruption is finally controlled and reduced to very mi=\r\nnimum.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Further, in this age of Kali the karmas and rn=\r\nas have become so &gt;twisted and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; You have spoken the tru=\r\nth. The\n world today is many times more tempting then say even 100 years ba=\r\nck. It is better to be a married person (Even for a very elavated soul like=\r\n Vivekananda if comes back) and overcome the pleasure/pains of sexual desir=\r\nes.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Finally, i would say that its high time for Big names =\r\nand even Bigger claims Spiritual Masters start taking a leaf out of Vimalan=\r\nanda or Mahatma Gandhi&#39;s bold approach to the subject of physical and menta=\r\nl Sex (Which is *One of the* prilimianry steps in final Brahmacharya. )&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; It reminds me of Sant Tukaaram&#39;s famous line&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Jaisa B=\r\nole Taisa Chale tyaachi Vandaavi Paule&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Utpal &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc245.mail=\r\n.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank =\r\nrel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajar=\r\nshi14@ &gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; I too believe we should give the benefit of doubt to Swa=\r\nmi Nityananda.

She wants it\n that way and so it is that way.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Further, in this age of Kali the karmas =\r\nand rnas have become so twisted and complex that untill you pay back the rn=\r\nas, it will keep hounding you. How is one going to overcome that? Our socie=\r\nty too is steeped in unnecessary prudishness and misconceptions about lust =\r\nand spirituality. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; All said and done=\r\n, Vimalanada - whom I consider to be one of the greatest Saints who lived -=\r\n took 6 years of struggle to overcome lust. What to speak of ordianry sadhu=\r\ns and saints?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; And finally, it is q&#92;u=\r\nite possible that Swami Nityananda *maybe* a fake guru. We do not know. But=\r\n in the times to come, the idea of running after a guru will change. Each o=\r\nne must take God as his/her guru and keep doing sadhana and Nature will tea=\r\nch in the best possible way. In this regard, fire can act as an excellent g=\r\nuru if one keeps doing homas for some\n years. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Between me and You, there is only me.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; T=\r\nake away the me, so only You remain&quot; - Hallaj&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --=\r\n- On Thu, 4/3/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sub=\r\nject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Sex scandals by spiritual gurus&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To: &lt;=\r\nA href=3D&quot;http://us.mc245.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yah=\r\noogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com=\r\n&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, 4 March, 2010, 8:26 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; =C3=82&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste KK,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; No matter how genu=\r\nine the video may look, let us give the benefit of doubt to Paramahamsa Nit=\r\nhyananda and not jump to conclusions as someone said.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; *Even if* his expose on video is gen=\r\nuine, it is only a reminder that nobody is free from Mahamaya&#39;s web. He is =\r\na fantastic teacher of spiritual concepts. He has a charming and endearing =\r\ndisposition and a lucid and eloquent way of explaining high philosophy in s=\r\nimple and demystified terms. Irrespective of his weaknesses that may have b=\r\neen exposed now, he is clearly a man of excellent knowledge and rare wisdom=\r\n. Who is to tell how *we* will fare when our time comes for a test?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; No matter how much one has read, no matter how much one=\r\n has understood, no matter how much sadhana one has done, no matter how man=\r\ny good karmas\n one has done, no matter what spiritual experiences one had, =\r\nno matter how blissful one feels during meditation or most of the time, no =\r\nmatter how elevated one is spiritually, one can still fall. Take your mind =\r\noff god for a second and you CAN fall. When we are not in a state where min=\r\nd is focused on god 24x7, we are vulnerable to a fall. Then why should we j=\r\nudge others?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Th=\r\ne most important thing is to surrender to Her (or Him) and keep that attitu=\r\nde of a dedicated servant forever. There may be some members of this group =\r\nwho make good progress in the coming years and people around them may start=\r\n noticing their purity and treating them specially. The key is to not be sw=\r\nayed by name, fame, image, following, respect, money etc and retain the min=\r\ndset of a dedicated servant, in the midst of either adulation or adversity.=\r\n If one allows self-consciousness, ego and pride to take root in one&#39;s mind=\r\n, one\n thing leads to another and one falls in the web of Mahamaya.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Even if a spiritual ma=\r\nster really had weaknesses and fell, we do not benefit whatsoever by discus=\r\nsing those weaknesses. If we instead discuss his teachings, we may still be=\r\nnefit. A blue sky does not suddenly become green if the greatest liar says =\r\nsky is blue. Similarly, spiritual truths do not become invalid if a person =\r\nwho taught them fell.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; Perhaps an increase of dharma is not possible without exposing and w=\r\needing out some adharma, atleast in key places. We can never know for sure =\r\nwhat the Mother has in store.
