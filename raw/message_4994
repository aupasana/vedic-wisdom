This is a continuation of the vedic =\r\nattitude where one after the other each Deva is in turn praised as being ev=\r\nery other Deva and being responsible for all creation.\n\nThe crux of this is=\r\n that we are relying on the Divine and not on our own effort or intelligenc=\r\ne.\n\nTo take it a step further, as they say- Yatho brahmande- tatho pindande=\r\n.Then you have all the related stories of millions of Gods being in the go-=\r\nmatha and in the human body etc.Ultimately, Sri Hari, Sadashiva, Mahadurga/=\r\nChandi are the same.We just have to rely on belief until we experience. \n\n =\r\n        So the important thing is the attitude and not the form. Its all di=\r\nfferent flavours of the same thing. Which flavour really attracts you ? The=\r\nre are various sources from our scriptures which can give you a mental stru=\r\nt for this thought till it is realised- based on who your ishta devatha is(=\r\n and I dont mean this in an astrological sense). Reading all the different =\r\nsources and getting confused is like having chocolate, pickle and spicy foo=\r\nd all the same meal and complaining of a stomach ache. They are all good by=\r\n themselves, but are not meant to be combined and cause intellectual confus=\r\nion. One need not be a Pundit to be a good sadhaka.\n\nFrom what I have read-=\r\n deha suddhi is essential for bahir puja and even upamsa japa. Manasa japa =\r\ndoes not require external purity.\n\n\nI hope this helps..\n\nGum gurubhyo namah=\r\na\n\n\nS\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;prm7782&quot; &lt;prm7782@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Namaskaram Narsimhagaru and learned members,\n&gt; \n&gt; When I do vishnu Homam=\r\n I say Lord Vishnu I surrender to you, later I read Durga Saptashati I say =\r\nmother I surrender to you, then I visit Shiva temple I say I surrender to y=\r\nou.
