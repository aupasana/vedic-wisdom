The sweating or hot sensation t=\r\nhat you\nwere feeling could be related to the japam or completely unrelated =\r\nit is\ndifficult to classify it based on limited occurance.  Unless it gets\n=\r\nreally bothersome or creates some medical anxiety for you it is best to\nign=\r\nore.\n\nSadhakas doing japam regularly and with lot of focus and devotion can=\r\n\nexperience some cleansing or energy sensations and this could be\nexperienc=\r\ned through feelings of being hot or running a temperature or\neven having va=\r\nrious sensations (hot or cold) in your feet or head region\nsuch as forehead=\r\n and eyes.  This is more so in the case where the japam\nis that of an ugra =\r\ndevata.  As an example, there are mantras prescribed\nfor Narasimha or even =\r\nHanumanji for warding off fever and a person doing\nsuch mantras, example wi=\r\nth &quot;Kshraum&quot; beeja of Narasimha, if done\nproperly, may produce sweat and he=\r\nnce fever may be reduced.\n\nSince you experienced your sensations only a few=\r\n times I would not worry\ntoo much.  As Narasimha says regularly the objecti=\r\nve is to not get\ndistracted by what is happening to you and around you, rat=\r\nher it is to\nlessen the self identification of ego with your physical body =\r\nand to\nmove towards identification with a specific diety or state of\nconsci=\r\nousness.\n\nBest regards\n\nSumeet\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;naaraa=\r\nyana_iyer&quot;\n&lt;narayan.iyer@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Sri Aashish,\n&gt;\n&gt; Everythin=\r\ng looks fine. Just keep reciting the Saptashloki, and why\nlimit it once? It=\r\n just takes 5 minutes (if you are not acquainted), so\nyou can do it 11 time=\r\ns or more!\n&gt;\n&gt; You might also want to try Devi Kavacham from the same book =\r\nDurga\nSaptashati or Chandi Path.
