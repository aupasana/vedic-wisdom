What is the meaning\nof this?=E2=80=9D\n\nBhagavan answer=\r\ned,\n\n=E2=80=9CThe reflected consciousness of the Self (Atman) is called Ish=\r\nwara, and\nIshwara reflected through the thinking faculty is called the jiva=\r\n. That is\nall.=E2=80=9D\n\nThe devotee: =E2=80=9CThat is all right, Swami, bu=\r\nt what then is chidabhasa?=E2=80=9D\n\nBhagavan: =E2=80=9CChidabhasa is the f=\r\neeling of the Self which appears as the\nshining of the mind. The one become=\r\ns three, the three becomes five and the\nfive becomes many; that is, the pur=\r\ne Self (satva), which appears to be one,\nbecomes through contact, three (sa=\r\ntva, rajas and tamas) and with those\nthree, the five elements come into exi=\r\nstence, and with those five, the whole\nUniverse.\n\nIt is this which creates =\r\nthe illusion that the body is the Self. In terms of\nthe sky (akasa), it is =\r\nexplained as being divided into three categories, as\nreflected in the soul:=\r\n the boundless world of pure consciousness, the\nboundless world of mental c=\r\nonsciousness and the boundless world of matter\n(chidakasa, chittakasa and b=\r\nhutakasa). When Mind (chitta), is divided into\nits three aspects, namely mi=\r\nnd, intuition and =E2=80=98Maker of the I=E2=80=99 (manas,\nbuddhi and ahank=\r\nara), it is called the inner instrument, or =E2=80=98antahkarana=E2=80=99.\n=\r\n\nKaranam means upakaranam. Legs, hands and other organs of the body are\ncal=\r\nled =E2=80=98bahyakarana=E2=80=99, or outer instruments, while the senses (=\r\nindriyas)\nwhich work inside the body are antahkaranas or inner instruments.=\r\n That\nfeeling of the Self, or shining mind, which works with these inner\nin=\r\nstruments, is said to be the personal soul, or jiva. When the mental\nconsci=\r\nousness, which is a reflection of the tangible aspect of pure\nconsciousness=\r\n, sees the world of matter, it is called mental world (mano\nakasa), but whe=\r\nn it sees the tangible aspect of pure consciousness, it is\ncalled total con=\r\nsciousness (chinmaya). That is why it is said, =E2=80=98The mind is\nthe cau=\r\nse of both bondage and liberation for man (mana eva manushyanam\nkaranam ban=\r\ndha mokshayoh)=E2=80=99. That mind creates many illusions.=E2=80=9D\n\nThe qu=\r\nestioner: =E2=80=9CHow will that illusion disappear?=E2=80=9D\n\nBhagavan: =\r\n=E2=80=9CIf the secret truth mentioned above is ascertained by\nSelf-enquiry=\r\n, the multiplicity resolves itself into five, the five into\nthree, and the =\r\nthree into one. Suppose you have a headache and you get rid\nof it by taking=\r\n some medicine. You then remain what you were originally. The\nheadache is l=\r\nike the illusion that the body is the Self; it disappears when\nthe medicine=\r\n called Self-enquiry is administered.=E2=80=9D\n\nThe questioner: =E2=80=9CIs=\r\n it possible for all people to hold on to that path of\nSelf-enquiry?=E2=80=\r\n=9D\n\nBhagavan: =E2=80=9CIt is true that it is only possible for mature mind=\r\ns, not for\nimmature ones. For the latter, repetition of a prayer or holy na=\r\nme under\none=E2=80=99s breath (japa), worship of images, breath-control (pr=\r\nanayama),\nvisualising a pillar of light (Jyotishtoma) and similar yogic and=\r\n spiritual\nand religious practices have been prescribed. By those practices=\r\n, people\nbecome mature and will then realize the Self through the path of\nS=\r\nelf-enquiry. To remove the illusion of immature minds in regard to this\nwor=\r\nld, they have to be told that they are different from the body. It is\nenoug=\r\nh if you say, you are everything, all-pervading. The Ancients say that\nthos=\r\ne with immature minds should be told that they must know the\ntranscendent S=\r\neer through enquiry into the five elements and reject them by\nthe process o=\r\nf repeating, =E2=80=98Not this, not this (Neti, neti)=E2=80=99. After sayin=\r\ng\nthis, they point out that just as gold ornaments are not different from\ng=\r\nold, so the elements are your own Self. Hence it must be said that this\nwor=\r\nld is real.\n\n=E2=80=9CPeople note the differences between the various types=\r\n of ornaments, but\ndoes the goldsmith recognise the difference? He only loo=\r\nks into the fineness\nof the gold. In the same way, for the Realized Soul, t=\r\nhe Jnani, everything\nappears to be his own Self. Sankara=E2=80=99s method w=\r\nas also the same. Without\nunderstanding this, some people call him a nihili=\r\nst (mithyavadi), that is,\none who argues that the world is unreal. It is al=\r\nl meaningless talk. Just as\nwhen you see a stone carved into the form of a =\r\ndog and you realise that it\nis only a stone, there is no dog for you; so al=\r\nso, if you see it only as a\ndog without realizing that it is a stone, there=\r\n is no stone for you. If you\nare existent, everything is existent; if you a=\r\nre non-existent, there is\nnothing existent in this world. If it is said tha=\r\nt there is no dog, but\nthere is a stone, it does not mean that the dog ran =\r\naway on your seeing the\nstone.\n\nThere is a story about this. A man wanted t=\r\no see the King=E2=80=99s palace, and so\nstarted out. Now, there were two do=\r\ngs carved out of stone, one on either\nside of the palace gateway. The man s=\r\ntanding at a distance took them for\nreal dogs and was afraid of going near =\r\nthem. A saint passing along that way\nnoticed this and took the man along wi=\r\nth him, saying, =E2=80=98Sir, there is no need\nto be afraid.=E2=80=99 When =\r\nthe man got near enough to see clearly, he saw that\nthere were no dogs, and=\r\n what he had thought to be dogs, were just stone\ncarvings.\n\n=E2=80=9CIn the=\r\n same way, if you see the world, the Self will not be visible; if you\nsee t=\r\nhe Self, the world will not be visible. A good Teacher (Guru) is like\nthat =\r\nsaint. A Realized Soul who knows the truth is aware of the fact that he\nis =\r\nnot the body.\n\nBut there is one thing more. Unless one looks upon death as =\r\na thing that is\nvery near and might happen at any moment, one will not be a=\r\nware of the Self.\nThis means that the ego must die, must vanish, along with=\r\n the inherent\nvasanas. If the ego vanishes thus, the Self will shine as the=\r\n luminous\nSelf. Such\npeople will be on a high spiritual plane, free from bi=\r\nrths and deaths.=E2=80=9D With\nthat Bhagavan stopped his discourse.\n\nSource=\r\ns:\n1) Letters from Sri Ramanasramam by Suri Nagamma\n2) http://suri-nagamma.=\r\nblogspot.com/2007/08/letter-141.html\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=\r\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =\r\n=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=\r\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd146f8b10f110484a55798\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;12th September, 1947=C2=A0&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A devotee who came here some time back and had been listening to =\r\nthe various discussions in Bhagavan=E2=80=99s presence, approached Bhagavan=\r\n this afternoon and respectfully asked, =E2=80=9CSwami, it is said that Ish=\r\nwara who is the reflection of the soul and appears as the thinking mind, ha=\r\ns become jiva, the personal soul, which is the reflection of the thinking f=\r\naculty.
