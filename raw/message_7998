It depends hugely on the sadhana that particular perso=\r\nn had performed during his lifetime and how well that particular person had=\r\n prepared for his death. Why would donating the organs and cremating rest o=\r\nf the body change the trajectory of the soul.\n\nIf that were true every body=\r\n given a proper cremation with shanti karmas should have reincarnated as si=\r\nddha purushas by this time .\n\nRegards\nVemparla RamKishore \n\n\n\n--- In vedic-=\r\nwisdom@yahoogroups.com, Hemanth Kumar G &lt;vijnasu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; =A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 Vedas certainly wont entertain any kind of bodily transfers as=\r\n it is in practice in the modern era in the name of &quot;Blood Donation&quot;,=A0 &quot;E=\r\nye Donation&quot; & &quot;Organ Donation&quot; during alive or death for the purpose of ju=\r\nst a transplantation or medical experiments. There is a clear cut methodolo=\r\ngies after the death called &quot;Uttara Shodasha Kriya&quot; which has matured scien=\r\ntific thoughts from several seers. It requires lot of elongated sessions to=\r\n make one understand why these kinds of transfusion is prohibited according=\r\n to our Dharmic rituals? So these transplantation are prohibited according =\r\nto Vedas, Sutras, Vedic Medical Science, theory of Karma Siddanta, Samskara=\r\n Prakriyas and many more.\n&gt; \n&gt; In puranas, if there is a story of transplan=\r\ntation, one has to see the person, Social necessity, correct intention, etc=\r\n., In case of Vajrayudha, no other way was there to put a full stop for the=\r\n Vrtrasura&#39;s menace to Earth and Heaven. Only Dadhichi possessed the streng=\r\nth of diamond in his back bone that was gained by thousands of years of Tap=\r\nasya. Bone was removed as he was alive. Else Indra and other devatas will b=\r\ne summoned with &quot;Brahma Hatya Dosha&quot;. So in every case of purana there will=\r\n be lot of reasons!! not just the one being practiced blind fold now in the=\r\n name of advanced science and technology which cannot touch the dust of see=\r\nr&#39;s foot!!\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
