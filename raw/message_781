Though mr.Z satsfies the want \nof \n&gt; &gt; cop=\r\nulation, it comes back again & again. it means that the \ndesire \n&gt; &gt; has ne=\r\nver been satsfied even by giving it FOOD Again & again.\n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; Our spi=\r\nritual giants equvivocally say that The Energy which is \nlost \n&gt; &gt; during c=\r\nopulation is the BEST Energy available in a person which \nif \n&gt; &gt; restraine=\r\nd, controlled and preserved, can easly become OJAS and \ncan \n&gt; &gt; help immen=\r\nsly in the path of Spiritual journey.\n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; consider that our Mr. Z s=\r\nome how got to read the above paragraph \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; started seriously think=\r\ning about it.

The earlier frequency was \n&gt; 2/3 \n&gt; &gt; days, now he suddenly =\r\nfinds that desire has completely overtaken \n&gt; &gt; him. after 15 days, he find=\r\ns that Desire has gone in to his \nevery \n&gt; &gt; pour and every thought and he =\r\ngives up and succumbs to that \n&gt; gigantic \n&gt; &gt; force of Kaam Vaasana. This =\r\nmay be called suppression initially \n&gt; &gt; which failed the effort. The perso=\r\nn again analyses what went \nwrong \n&gt; &gt; and again tries to do the same and a=\r\ngain fails. he keeps on \ntrying \n&gt; &gt; and keeps on failing. during this batt=\r\nles, he is also exploring \nand \n&gt; &gt; gathering knowledge of experienced peop=\r\nle and knowledge from \n&gt; &gt; spiritual books. he understands that if he needs=\r\n to win the \nFinal \n&gt; &gt; WAR with this Very Formidable enemy, he needs to do=\r\n lot of \nthings \n&gt; &gt; simultaneously and he then resorts to the help from ma=\r\nny \nquarters. \n&gt; &gt; He starts taking cold water bath, starts reading spiritu=\r\nal \nbooks, \n&gt; &gt; stops reading film magazine, stops watching Films and TV Sh=\r\nows, \n&gt; &gt; Reduces eating Onion and garlic, starts doing Yoga Aasan, \n&gt; Medi=\r\ntation \n&gt; &gt; and so on and so forth. taking the aids thus he keeps on \nbatte=\r\nling \n&gt; &gt; with the *Natural Desire* and still keeps on loosing. but the \ngo=\r\nod \n&gt; &gt; news is that his days of batteling before loosing has increased. \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; started from 10 days, he has now reached the struggeling \ncapacity \n&gt; of=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; 90 days. (WE ARE ASSUMING HERE THAT HIS WIFE IS FULLY \nCOOPERATIVE \n&gt;=\r\n OF \n&gt; &gt; HIS THEATRICS). He is still unhappy about his loosing, although \nh=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt; is able to keep-up the Physical brahmacharya for 3 months. some \nhow=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; he realises that God&#39;s grace is the most important thing \nespecially =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; for this perticular matter and he now starts Praying to his \n&gt; &gt; favou=\r\nrite Deity every day. he cries and cries and requests the \nGod \n&gt; &gt; to save=\r\n him from this loss. he keeps on trying every thing \n&gt; possible, \n&gt; &gt; keeps=\r\n on praying sincerely and severly, keeps on doing various \n&gt; &gt; spiritual sa=\r\ndhanas but still keeps on loosing at as well. over a \n&gt; &gt; period of some 8/=\r\n10 years, the desired change is visible. he has \n&gt; &gt; conquered his desire. =\r\nNow Sexual Desire which was his *Natural* \nfor \n&gt; &gt; him has been replaced b=\r\ny Brahmacharya.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &#39;Supression&#39; when combined with Thoughtful Suspens=\r\nion, equipped \n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; every possible preparation and will power to try=\r\n untiringly \nagain & \n&gt; &gt; again finally results in to annihilation.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2.

Set a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rule for 20 days or 40 days or 108 days or some p=\r\neriod \nlike \n&gt; &gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; maintain physic=\r\nal brahmacharya. Don&#39;t worry if thoughts \ncome.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Feeling of guilt is a weight and it does not help in \n&gt; &gt; overcomin=\r\ng \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the basic \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problem.

Th=\r\nis is the \n&gt; nature \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desire. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Whether one desires money or knowledge (of anything other \n&gt; than \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Self) or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physical pleasures, the desire will n=\r\never end no matter \nhow \n&gt; &gt; much \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one gets.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Removing desire from the root often requires suppressin=\r\ng \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporarily. But the thing =\r\nto remember from the Aghora \nbook \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that just \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suppressing desire is not sufficient. Practice suppressing \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desires, but do \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; remember that the final goal is =\r\nto uproot it fully and \nkeep \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; working on it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The only reason for which i keep trying for brahamcha=\r\nrya \nis \n&gt; &gt; if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vimalananda took such a long time probas=\r\nbly i can also \ndo \n&gt; &gt; it , \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not in 6 y=\r\nears at least in 10-12 years\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That is the=\r\n right spirit!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritual progress involv=\r\nes a lot of things and \nbrahmacharya \n&gt; &gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one thing. \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The most fundamental thing is to overcome ego and not \nbecom=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attached to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; things. Developing detachme=\r\nnt to one&#39;s actions and \n&gt; possessions \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ndeveloping a sense of surrender is the most fundamental \nthing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are several things in spiritual progress. The=\r\ny all \ncome \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; together! One \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person may deve=\r\nlop detachment to actions and possessions \nand \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brahmacharya=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may become easy as a result. One person may achieve \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n brahmacharya \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; detachment may be=\r\ncome easy as a result and come later. \n&gt; Various \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; signs of \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual progress come almost together, but the exact \nor=\r\nder \n&gt; &gt; can \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; change from \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person to person=\r\n.

&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it was important to maintain =\r\nbrahamcharya but i wanted to \nask \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; even =\r\nvimalananda had to work for 6 years for overcoming \nlust \n&gt;

&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, how can i finish it completely from my mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though i have read Swami Sivananda&#39;s book on Practice of \n&gt;
