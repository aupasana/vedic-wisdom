Kali is a lesser form. Mahakali\n&gt; in the higher planes appears usually with the golden colour.\n\nOn Kali, he says with such eloquence (from Essays on the Gita):\n\n&gt; It is only a few religions which have had the courage to say without\n&gt; any reserve, like the Indian, that this enigmatic World-Power is one\n&gt; Deity, one Trinity, to lift up the image of the Force that acts in\n&gt; the world in the figure not only of the beneficent Durga, but of the\n&gt; terrible Kali in her blood-stained dance of destruction and to say,\n&gt; &quot;This too is the Mother; this also know to be God; this too, if thou\n&gt; hast the strength, adore.&quot; And it is significant that the religion\n&gt; which has had this unflinching honesty and tremendous courage, has \n&gt; succeeded in creating a profound and wide-spread spirituality such as\n&gt; no other can parallel. For truth is the foundation of real\n&gt; spirituality and courage is its soul. /Tasyai satyam Ayatanam/.\n\nSo I think there need not be a contradiction with the teachings of\nRamakrishna.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSamir\n\n\nOn 09/10/2009 13:18, vedic_pathak wrote:\n&gt; Dear Rajarshi and Sameer,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not able to digest what Maharshi Aurobindo has said about Kali.\n&gt;  It is contradicting Thakur&#39;s views about the Kali and my own\n&gt; thinking.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; What does it matter how the pranpratistha has been done, if I am\n&gt;&gt; &gt;using the name Kali to address my prayers\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes. I have always carried words of Thakur in my heart. one of the\n&gt; greatest words which were spoken to M during his second meeting with\n&gt; him. extending that spirit, If Kali is sincerely prayed, will she not\n&gt; know? SHE is every where. isn&#39;t it. so in one sense, Idol becomes\n&gt; redundant however it has a purpose that it reminds one of Kali in a\n&gt; more effective way.\n&gt; \n&gt; what do you say?\n&gt; \n&gt; Sameer also said nice thing. If going to Holy places, do not pray for\n&gt; worldly desire. try hard to refrain from them and then what negative\n&gt; energies can do?\n&gt; \n&gt; sorry to butt in.\n&gt; \n&gt; Warm Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; \n\n"}}
