Ujjain is also famous for Raja Bharathat Hari \ncave.\n&gt; Raja Barathar=\r\ni is considered as one of the 9 Naths from the Nath \n&gt; Sampradaya. He medit=\r\nated for a long time and then he went south to\n&gt; Devas, a small town near I=\r\nndore. The legend is, a drop of blood \nfrom \n&gt; Sati when Lord Shiva was car=\r\nrying the corpse feel in Devas too. \nAnd \n&gt; in the same place on a hill the=\r\nre is a Chamunda Devi Temple. A lot \nof \n&gt; great Mahatmas since 1400 Have b=\r\neen staying and meditating there, \n&gt; starting with Raja Barathari, then cam=\r\ne the Poet Chand Bardai and \nthen\n&gt; Sheelnath Maharaj and Swami Shri Vishnu=\r\nTirth Maharaj in the 20th \n&gt; century. Over and above the temple now there i=\r\ns Sheelnath maharaj \n&gt; Dhuni Sanstan and also Swami VishnuTirth Maharaj&#39;s A=\r\nshram located \nin \n&gt; the valley of the hill where Mother Chamunda temple is=\r\n situated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mother in this temple manifested many times and gave guidan=\r\nce and \n&gt; darshan to all of the above saints. I am sure there are others wh=\r\no \n&gt; benefited too.\n&gt; \n&gt; They all stayed at the Temple in devas. It is said=\r\n even today many \n&gt; Mahatmas in Sooksma sareer come to pray Chamunda Devi o=\r\nn a regular \n&gt; basis.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards\n&gt; Mitesh\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------=\r\n---------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; || Om Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih ||\n&gt; Yahoo!
