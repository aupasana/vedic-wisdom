A=\r\ns a rule of thumb, if one begins his study from a biased point of view, he =\r\nwill never have the complete picture, even if he is given all the relevant =\r\npointers.\n:) :) I could not have agreed more.\n\n\nWhy do you think I would pa=\r\nint the complete picture, somebody has already painted it time and again in=\r\n scriptures, but you seem to fail to read it ? \n=C2=A0\nThat is what I am sa=\r\nying, and your picture is not matching the one that has been already painte=\r\nd! Therefore, the queries.\n\n&gt; If you take Samkhya, there are 24 elements, o=\r\nf which 5 are basic. \n&gt; And the rest are subtle. So when normal creation is=\r\n spoken of, it \n&gt; is spoken off in terms of 5 elements and not 6. \n\nDespite=\r\n all the knowledge that you have - it is evident that you have not studied =\r\nSankhya thoroughly.\n6 x 4 =3D 24\nIt actually refers to 6 tattwas - Where ar=\r\ne the 4 antahkaranas&#39; coming from NaraSimha - and why are they called Antah=\r\nKaranas&#39; at all ? Are your doubts over that Sankhya mentions about the 6th =\r\ntattwa ?\n=C2=A0\n\nNo, this increases some more questions. Firstly, some of t=\r\nhe interpretations of the Samkhya philosophy mention 3 antakaranas, some me=\r\nntion 4 and some mention 5 (taking Purusha also as one). Why should I stick=\r\n to 4?\n=C2=A0\nSecondly, if it is 4, why 4 x 6? What is the logic behoind it=\r\n? No where in any Samkhya text does it mention that these antakaranas manif=\r\nest as 6 tattwas. So, unless you can provide actual, factual quotes, I shal=\r\nl take it that you are merely playing number games with no real basis.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n\n\nGiven the amount of discord and contradictions amongst the scriptural=\r\n interpretations and authorities, Badrayana had to write &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot;.\n\n=\r\nIf you are discerning enough and re-read all the scriptures you have ever r=\r\nead, you will most certainly figure out that every scripture has mentioned =\r\nabout the 6th tattwa everywhere. All we need is to rise above the dogma pro=\r\npounded by a lot of people around us who have selfish motives, and keep wor=\r\nking in the correct direction.\n\nI am sorry, but I don&#39;t value=C2=A0personal=\r\n opinions too much in a scholarly debate. I need facts. Or else, I shall ta=\r\nke it as=C2=A0just some fanciful opinions with litte or no value.\n=C2=A0\n\nV=\r\nivekananda, mentioned it, but had not coined the term &quot;superether&quot; for this=\r\n 6th tattwa, while Yogananda was not a Jnana Yogi - but I take his word as =\r\nscriptural authority given his level of self-realization.\n=C2=A0\nToo vague.=\r\n In the analysis of Samkhya by Lahiri Mahasaya he never mentions Chitta as =\r\na sixth tattwa ever. I take his word as higher than Yoganandas, if it comes=\r\n down to X&#39;s word vs Y&#39;s word. \n=C2=A0\nLet me clarify, if you feel happy in=\r\n believing in a 6th tattwa, feel free to do so, but if you expect=C2=A0othe=\r\nrs like me to believe in a 6th tattwa, you need more facts on your side. \n\n=\r\n\n&gt; When you say that Gunas by &quot;inherent duality&quot; in nature give rise \n&gt; to =\r\n6 tattwas, I guess you are using a simple multiplication of 3 x &gt; 2 and arr=\r\niving at six.\n\nAlso, what is so wrong with a simple multiplication where mu=\r\nltiplication is required ? Do you know what is &quot;Law of Duality&quot; ?\n=C2=A0\nWh=\r\nat is so wrong with addding, substraction, divsion, sqaure root, exponentia=\r\nl, log 2 with base 3, etc etc? \n=C2=A0\nAs I said, you need more facts to su=\r\npport your statement, or else they remain merely as personal opinions. \n=C2=\r\n=A0\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n\nBTW, don&#39;t really want to go into kriya yoga of lahiri mahas=\r\nhaya, because it is better learnt from a teacher than discussed.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nAll aspects of real spirituality are better learnt from a teacher but y=\r\net discussion happen. I see no harm in it.\n\n\n&gt; &quot;....Ajna and mooladhara cha=\r\nkras are closely related, and the awakening of one helps to awaken the othe=\r\nr.\n\nWhat is any other possible meaning of this line than that the two chakr=\r\nas awaken each other and are related ?\n=C2=A0\nSure, and that will depend on=\r\n how you define the word awakening which I had asked you to right at the be=\r\nginning. Here awakening could well be a euphemism for merely symptomatic pa=\r\nrtial activation and nothing more. \n\n\nGanesha is worshipped first because m=\r\nooladhara is connected with Ajna chakra and the breathing process involves =\r\nthese two chakras\n(HaM-SaH). The breath connection makes it the most suitab=\r\nle place to connect the highest and lowest expressions of God-consciousness=\r\n, from brahma to a worm - every living creature breathes! \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=\r\n=C2=A0I see that you have merely given what you consider your understanding=\r\n, in which case I have no further points to make except rejecting your unde=\r\nrstanding. After all everyone is free to believe in what he/she thinks is c=\r\norrect. No issues with that. I firmly disagree to the explanation give by y=\r\nou regarding Ganesha.

Ideally, ajna should be awakened to some extent before mooladhara,=\r\n in order to allow an unaffected perception of the energies manifested by m=\r\nooladhara and the lower chakras. However, the awakening of mooladhara will =\r\nhelp to further awaken ajna. In fact, the best way to bring about awakening=\r\n of ajna is through the practices of moola bandha and ashwini mudra which a=\r\nre specific for mooladhara.. ..&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, thanks for the quote. However, =\r\nthis does not say that &quot;awakening&quot; of one will automatically &quot;awaken&quot; the o=\r\nther. It says, in an ideal case one should &quot;awaken&quot; Agya chakra to some ext=\r\nent before trying to awaken Mooladhara chakra. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; In a lot o=\r\nf people chakras remain &quot;awakened in various degrees&quot;without any conscinous=\r\n effort. Rarely would an individual appear who have absolutely zero awakeni=\r\nng of all chakras. In most cases, &quot;partially awakenend&quot; chakras do exist, b=\r\nut I am not sure if that is of any significant help in practical spirituali=\r\nty.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Plus, this is one of the possible paths of progess in =\r\nYoga, not the only one possible. Hence, we should not jump to conclusions w=\r\nhich are not explicitly stated. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; A fact, required to under=\r\nstand why Ganesh, deity of Mooladhara, is worshipped first.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Ganesha is worshipped first because it presides over the Mooladhara, n=\r\not because mooladhara has a connection with Agya. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Regardi=\r\nng the 6th tattwa there is nothing new to it, it already exists, Yogananda =\r\nwrites in his commentary the following:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;...Beyond the subtlest physic=\r\nal vibration (akasha, ether), Paramahansa Yogananda explained, is the super=\r\nether,&quot; a finer manifestation and therefore not classified as one of the ph=\r\nysical vibratory elements (tattvas), of which there are only five-earth, wa=\r\nter, fire, air, ether. Some yoga treatises define this tattwa as mind, or &#39;=\r\nnon-matter&#39; , as opposed to matter or gross vibration... .&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I am sorry=\r\n, but the above quote is a little vague. It no where mentions that Chitta i=\r\ns a 6th tattwa. What it does it says about the 5 gross elements and &quot;a fine=\r\nr manifestation&quot; . Maybe the intented audience for this passage was one who=\r\n is not intellectually aware of the basic=C3=82=C2=A0idea of five creative =\r\nelements. Otherwise, the &quot;super-ether&quot; needs more clarity. Is it prakiriti?=\r\n It is Chitta? Is it really sixth or does the six have more subsets? Is he =\r\ncalling it a vague six because we cannot be aware of the higher tattwas bey=\r\nond the five, therefore clubbing everything together into one?\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; As you mentioned Samkhya, it uses a calssification of the universe in=\r\n 24 tattwas with 5 which cause physical manifestations to occur. It is stil=\r\nl not 6 by any measure.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Again in Kasmiri Shaivism, they de=\r\nfine 36 tattwas! That is why the need to be technically precise so that we =\r\nmay not misunderstand each other.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; The tattwas are 5 in n=\r\number as per multiple Hindu scriptures, both &gt; Agamas/Nigamas as well as Up=\r\nanishads.\n&gt; \n&gt; Which scriptures ? Quotes ? \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Check the quot=\r\nation given by Sundeep right at the begining of this set of mails. Are you =\r\nquestioning the veracity of scriptures or the fact that they mention creati=\r\non is caused by five gross elements?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; It is through Sankhya, that yo=\r\nu can understand why Chitta is related to it. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; As I said b=\r\nefore, no one is denying the existence of Chitta. One is however questionin=\r\ng whether Chitta is a &#39;6th element&#39; . If you take Samkhya, there are 24 ele=\r\nments, of which 5 are basic. And the rest are subtle. So when normal creati=\r\non is spoken of, it is spoken off in terms of 5 elements and not 6. When th=\r\ne essence of spirituality is spoken off right upto the state of God, then w=\r\ne go into 24 or 36 (depending on your classification) . Further, in the 36 =\r\nelement lists, the &quot;suddha-tattwas&quot; are defined as unknowable from this pla=\r\nne of existence. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; As Narasimha knows Jyotis=\r\nh shastra also, he could probably figure out the rashi to which the 6th tat=\r\ntwa is attributed since I have already given the table out, so it is as rea=\r\nl as it rises daily.\n&gt; \n&gt; Umm, with due respect, no it is not yet easy. Lot=\r\n of hazy areas yet.

If yo=\r\nu can provide an exact quote with page number and name of the book, I will =\r\ntry and check. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; He explains in details =\r\nabout the &quot;granthi bhedans&quot; before one goes into actually awakening=C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0 any chakra for that matter.

Where is the beginning and the end of the sushumna passing through 6 =\r\ncerebro-spinal chakras ?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the physical body, it appears as a lin=\r\near movement from the lowest mooladhara to the highest ajna chakra - but th=\r\ne nadis&#39; emanating from these &quot;Shad-chakras&quot; - meet in a circular manner in=\r\nside the Sahasrara Chakra (See the diagram of Astral Nadis&#39; prepared by Yog=\r\niRaj ShyamaCharan Lahiri, published in Gita Commentary by Yogananda).\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Thus, the highest Ajna is connected to the lowest Mooladhara and the aw=\r\nakening of one of them affects the other, a fact rather well-documented in =\r\nYoga books. A fact, required to understand why Ganesh, deity of Mooladhara,=\r\n is worshipped first.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In Sahasrara chakra lies undifferentiated =\r\nconsciousness (Brahman or &gt;Aatman), where there are no I-ness or any object=\r\nification. Just &gt;below it, there are several lokas that people do not menti=\r\non \n&gt; &gt; &gt; normally.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With every invocation of Gayatri Mantra, we me=\r\nntion 3 or 7 of these lokas. Don&#39;t we do it &quot;Normally&quot; ? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In any c=\r\nase, we are not discussing about the actual experiences or undifferentiated=\r\n consciousness, the 6 tattwas that cause creation are still very much diffe=\r\nrentiated in Nature.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Patanjalis&#39; Chitta Vrittis&#39; correspond to the=\r\n 5 tattwas and are all happening on the background of Chitta, the all-perva=\r\nding 6th tattwa. The normal-human- experience happens by the 5 modification=\r\ns/ movement of Chitta (finest creation).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; How would the Soul become=\r\n aware of the more material Aakash Tattwa (and thus a single coherent self =\r\npervading the material physical body), if it were not standing behind the C=\r\nhitta (SuperEther) ?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thus, all our experiences of matter are throu=\r\ngh non-material Chitta, and it doesn&#39;t imply that 6th tattwa doesn&#39;t exist.=\r\n If you could calm all those modifications of Chitta, you would have your s=\r\nelf-realized.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In Aajnaa chakra lies the primordial state of the =\r\nuniverse where \n&gt; &gt; &gt; there is just space and time, but no five elements. \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nothing comes out from nothing. How can the lower tattwas evolve f=\r\nrom higher tattwas, if even their subtle representations are purged from ex=\r\nistence altogether ?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Greatest of the Seers have already put down t=\r\nhe scriptures in writing, so that people like us can benefit.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rega=\r\nrds,\n&gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha P=\r\nVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am only addressing=\r\n the five elements mentioned in upanishads.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In Sahasrara chakr=\r\na lies undifferentiated consciousness (Brahman or Aatman), where there are =\r\nno I-ness or any objectification.

It seems to be his extrapolation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What you =\r\nquoted from Taittariya Upanishad is the traditional view that I am familiar=\r\n with. Other scriptures refer to the same order of creation, including &quot;Yog=\r\na Vaasishtham&quot; , where Maharshi Vasishtha teaches creation, destruction and=\r\n liberation to Lord Rama.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; T=\r\nhis Upanishadic understanding is also consistent with chakra based understa=\r\nnding of Tantra. The five chakras downwards from Visuddhi chakra to Moolaad=\r\nhaara chakra represent ether, air, fire, water and earth. When Kundalini le=\r\naves Moolaadhaara, earth element within one is surrendered, i.e. all traces=\r\n of earth element are effaced in one&#39;s self-awareness. When Kundalini leave=\r\ns Swaadhishthaana, water element within one is surrendered, i.e. all traces=\r\n of water element are effaced in one&#39;s self-awareness. And so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By earth and water etc, don&#39;t just think of physical earth and =\r\nphysical water etc. Earth element shows a solid state of existence. Water e=\r\nlement shows a flexible and fluid state of existence. For example, an idea =\r\nthat one &quot;owns&quot; a particular thing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowl=\r\nedge etc) is of solid state and made of earth element. An idea that one &quot;ne=\r\neds&quot; a particular thing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) i=\r\ns of the nature of water element. Thus, different mental concepts and ideas=\r\n can be mapped to the five elements.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When one thinks o=\r\nf &quot;I&quot;, one perhaps thinks of a body that looks and feels in a particular wa=\r\ny physically. Apart from the physical aspect, one may think of &quot;I&quot; as someo=\r\nne who has certain qualities, certain needs, certain belongings etc. All th=\r\nose concepts one has about who one is, form one&#39;s self-awareness and Kundal=\r\nini represents that self-awareness. Kundalini cannot leave Moolaadhaara cha=\r\nkra, if *anything* that is *solid* in nature within one&#39;s cumulative idea o=\r\nf who one is is still remaining. Kundalini cannot leave Swaadhishthaana cha=\r\nkra, if *anything* that is *solid* or *fluid* in nature within one&#39;s cumula=\r\ntive idea of who one is is still remaining. And so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Many people who talk about experiences of Kundalini in higher chakras are =\r\noften talking merely about some amount of vaayus flowing in those chakras (=\r\nwhich may still be a nice experience) and have *not* experienced Kundalini =\r\nactually being there. IF Kundalini really leaves Moolaadhaara, one will not=\r\n perceive a solid body, one will not have notions of owning anything. Simil=\r\narly, as Kundalini moves up each chakra, each element is effaced in one&#39;s c=\r\numulative idea of who one is, at the physical as well as the subtle level o=\r\nf existence! To completely efface even one element (earth) from one&#39;s notio=\r\nn of self (&quot;I&quot;), even for a short duration of time, is not at all easy.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The order in which elements are effaced as one progresses=\r\n towards samadhi is - earth, water, fire, air and ether. If Kundalini again=\r\n comes down, effaced elements return to work in the reverse order - ether, =\r\nair, fire, water and earth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Regarding physics and spiritual realities:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does phy=\r\nsics describe reality?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Physics tries to describe/model=\r\n reality at the gross physical level, as perceived by the external senses. =\r\nHowever, one&#39;s mind can &quot;perceive&quot; things without the external senses playi=\r\nng a role.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a simple example, one may be asleep and =\r\nget a dream, in which one&#39;s mind may &quot;see&quot; some people and &quot;hear&quot; a convers=\r\nation between them. In another example, a yogi may be meditating with a man=\r\ntra with intense focus and &quot;see&quot; some scenes and/or &quot;hear&quot; some things. The=\r\nse things cannot be perceived by the external senses and hence cannot be st=\r\nudied by modern science.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is reasonable to define re=\r\nality as something that can be perceived by the external senses, because di=\r\nfferent people can experience the same reality using their senses individua=\r\nlly and verify the observation. However, some experiences of the mind that =\r\ncannot be perceived by senses are sometimes very powerful and have a huge, =\r\nlife-altering and sometimes liberating influence on people. Inability to st=\r\nudy and model them is a big drawback of modern science.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One may categorize dreams and internal yogic e=\r\nxperiences as imaginations or hallucinations, because there is no independe=\r\nnt validation, and call them unworthy of a study. But there are cases that =\r\nmake one wonder. For example, see the following messages from the archives.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mystical experiences of mind and mantras (message 951=\r\n)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 951\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message, one person had a specific yogic expe=\r\nrience that was described in detail and another person seemed to know about=\r\n it and supplied one tangible detail relating to the experience, suggesting=\r\n that he too &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the first person, though it was b=\r\neyond the external senses of either person!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Re: Guru (=\r\nmessage 391)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/messag=\r\ne/ 391\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message also, one person had a spe=\r\ncific yogic experience that was described in detail and another person seem=\r\ned to know about it and supplied a couple of tangible details relating to t=\r\nhe experience, suggesting that he too &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the firs=\r\nt person, though it was beyond the external senses of either person!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Internal god and external god (message 2498)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http:=\r\n//groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 2498\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n In the above message, one person had a specific yogic experience involving=\r\n a deity and another person perceived with his external senses a vision inv=\r\nolving the same deity, though others in the room could not perceive anythin=\r\ng with their external senses, suggesting that the second person &quot;observed&quot; =\r\nthe experience of the first person through a specific prism.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Such examples cannot prove much, but they=\r\n do suggest that perhaps *some* experiences that cannot be measured or perc=\r\neived by the external senses are observable by others, though not everyone =\r\nmay be able to observe. Then, one cannot rule out the possibility of *some*=\r\n experiences that cannot be measured or perceived by the external senses be=\r\ning a part of the &quot;reality&quot; that mind can access.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But,=\r\n how can modern science study it?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Because the only thi=\r\nng that can be studied and measured is the reality involving the gross body=\r\n and its senses, one may suggest that experiences of the subtle body may be=\r\n studied by observing various parts of the gross physical body. For example=\r\n, one can look at the nervous signals flowing through various parts of the =\r\nbrain and try to correlate them with the experiences of the subtle body.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On the surface, it sounds like a great idea. But, it ass=\r\numes that subtle body and causal body are redundant. Though there is some c=\r\norrespondence between what happens in the causal, subtle and gross bodies, =\r\nit is a many-to-many mapping and NOT a one-to-one mapping, in which case th=\r\ne concept of causal and subtle bodies would be redundant, i.e. whatever the=\r\ny model can be moderled using just the gross body!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If =\r\nyou drive through a neighborhood and observe the houses from the road, you =\r\ncan have *some* idea of what is going on. A particular house with a lot of =\r\nlights and sound and many cars parked outside may be having a party. People=\r\n in one particular house with no lights are probably out of town. But you c=\r\nan never be sure what is going on in the house, how many people are inside,=\r\n what exactly they are doing etc, by merely looking at the house from outsi=\r\nde.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, by looking at the nervous signals in va=\r\nrious points of the brain, you may be able to see some basic things, but no=\r\nt much. The experiences of the subtle mind are beyond your reach and study,=\r\n if your tools are limited to the gross physical domain.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, modern science cannot study th=\r\nat part of the reality which is beyond the scope of external senses, unless=\r\n scientists become yogis and develop mastery of the internal world.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While rishis of ancient times had mastery of the internal wor=\r\nld (which is the microcosm of the entire universe) and could observe any sp=\r\nace-time point, even the greatest yogis of today cannot control their state=\r\n completely. When Kundalini rises, it may go somewhere and one may experien=\r\nce some part of the Infinite Reality. But one cannot control exactly where =\r\nKundalini goes and exactly which part of the Infinite Reality one observes.=\r\n Rishis seemed to have a perfect control.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- =\r\n--------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Vedic=\r\nAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.Ved=\r\nicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com=\r\n/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicast=\r\nro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www=\r\n.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://=\r\nwww.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- =\r\n--------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@=\r\n &gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry the previous mail went off incomplete. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sundeep,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me mention so=\r\nme stuff from the diaries of Sri Shamacharun Lahiri (a self realized Yogi o=\r\nf the highest order) - it maybe of some help to you.

Then from there=\r\n came the &quot;vidhyut&quot; of Akash. As this &quot;Vidyut&quot; interacted with the chaos, i=\r\nt produced some universal energies which are more commonly known as the uni=\r\nversal deities like Shiva, Vishnu etc etc. Then came the &quot;Vidyut&quot; of vayu (=\r\n none of these are the actual physical elements as we see it, but more the =\r\nessence of the element, hence his use of the word &quot;vidyut&quot; and &quot; taranga&quot;) =\r\nwhose interaction with the chaos resulted in some more energy states. Thus,=\r\n in this way came, Agni, Apa and Prithwi, each one resulting from the previ=\r\nous and each one resulting in some energy states, which in the end resulted=\r\n in 33 crore possible states of energy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is s=\r\nome lesson in there (at least for me), and I want to get at it.. I feel the=\r\nre may be some correlation between that and the 11-dimensional physics of s=\r\nuper string theory too, but I get ahead of myself..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; This is a nice idea and I would like to know more about it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As much as I could fathom (I am no physicist, neither do I have=\r\n the ability to penetrate the mathematics of the M-Theory), as it stands no=\r\nw, it is quite half formed. There being multiple theories of the String var=\r\niety, adhered to by multiple physicists, the M-Theory (11 dimensional one) =\r\nis one of the many which &#39;claim to explain&#39; in parts some aspects of the ph=\r\nysical world. Finding a correlation between this and the idea of the five e=\r\nlements, in my humble opinion, is still far fetched. I can understand some =\r\ncorrelation between basic Quantum Mechanics, (at least the Copenhegan Inter=\r\npretation) , non-locality etc, and the ideas of Indian mysticism, but a lin=\r\nk between M-theory of panch-mahabhuta? !..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, w=\r\nith the kind permission of Narasimha, I would like to know more about how e=\r\nxactly you can link these two, because I myself with my limited understand =\r\nfail to see any viable correlation at all as of now, specially, since the M=\r\n-theory is yet in a very nascent stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The other =\r\nthing one must think about is the basic nature of theoritical physics. Does=\r\n physics describe reality? Or does it provide a model of reality? These two=\r\n are different. Mathematics provides a tool/model to gauge reality. It need=\r\n not be exactly as reality is. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which is why Richard Feynman on=\r\nce famously quoted that everyone knows that Quatum Mechanics works, but no =\r\none know what it really is!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The idea of the pach m=\r\nahabhuta and creation is almost the essence of everything. The day physics =\r\ngets THAT deep, there would be really nothing more left to do.

Therefore, the queries.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&gt; If yo=\r\nu take Samkhya, there are 24 elements, of which 5 are basic. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; And t=\r\nhe rest are subtle. So when normal creation is spoken of, it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; is sp=\r\noken off in terms of 5 elements and not 6. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Despite all the knowledg=\r\ne that you have - it is evident that you have not studied Sankhya thoroughl=\r\ny.&lt;BR&gt;6 x 4 =3D 24&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;It actually refers to 6 tattwas - Where are =\r\nthe 4 antahkaranas&#39; coming from NaraSimha - and why are they called AntahKa=\r\nranas&#39; at all ? Are your doubts over that Sankhya mentions about the 6th ta=\r\nttwa ?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;No, =\r\nthis increases some more questions. Firstly, some of the interpretations of=\r\n the Samkhya philosophy mention 3 antakaranas, some mention 4 and some ment=\r\nion 5 (taking Purusha also as one). Why should I stick to 4?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Secondly, if it is 4, why 4 x 6? What is the logic behoind i=\r\nt? No where in any Samkhya text does it mention that these antakaranas mani=\r\nfest as 6 tattwas. So, unless you can provide actual, factual quotes, I sha=\r\nll take it that you are merely playing number games with no real basis.&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Given the amount of discord and contr=\r\nadictions amongst the scriptural interpretations and authorities, Badrayana=\r\n had to write &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you are discerning enough and re-r=\r\nead all the scriptures you have ever read, you will most certainly figure o=\r\nut that every scripture has mentioned about the 6th tattwa everywhere. All =\r\nwe need is to rise above the dogma propounded by a lot of people around us =\r\nwho have selfish motives, and keep working in the correct direction.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I am sorry, but I don&#39;t value&nbsp;personal opinions too much=\r\n in a scholarly debate. I need facts. Or else, I shall take it as&nbsp;just=\r\n some fanciful opinions with litte or no value.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Vivekananda, mentioned it, but had not coined the term &quot;superethe=\r\nr&quot; for this 6th tattwa, while Yogananda was not a Jnana Yogi - but I take h=\r\nis word as scriptural authority given his level of self-realization.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Too vague. In the analy=\r\nsis of Samkhya by Lahiri Mahasaya he never mentions Chitta as a sixth tattw=\r\na ever. I take his word as higher than Yoganandas, if it comes down to X&#39;s =\r\nword vs Y&#39;s word. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Let me clarify, if you feel=\r\n happy in believing in a 6th tattwa, feel free to do so, but if you expect&=\r\nnbsp;others like me to believe in a 6th tattwa, you need more facts on your=\r\n side. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&gt; When you say that Gunas by &quot;inherent du=\r\nality&quot; in nature give rise &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to 6 tattwas, I guess you are using a s=\r\nimple multiplication of 3 x &gt; 2 and arriving at six.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Also, what i=\r\ns so wrong with a simple multiplication where multiplication is required ? =\r\nDo you know what is &quot;Law of Duality&quot; ?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;What is so wrong with addding, substraction, divsion, sqaure root, e=\r\nxponential, log 2 with base 3, etc etc? &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;As I =\r\nsaid, you need more facts to support your statement, or else they remain me=\r\nrely as personal opinions. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;BTW, don&#39;t really want to go into kriya yoga of lahiri =\r\nmahashaya, because it is better learnt from a teacher than discussed.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;All aspect=\r\ns of real spirituality are better learnt from a teacher but yet discussion =\r\nhappen.

Here awakening=\r\n could well be a euphemism for merely symptomatic partial activation and no=\r\nthing more. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Ganesha is worshipped first because moo=\r\nladhara is connected with Ajna chakra and the breathing process involves th=\r\nese two chakras&lt;BR&gt;(HaM-SaH). The breath connection makes it the most suita=\r\nble place to connect the highest and lowest expressions of God-consciousnes=\r\ns, from brahma to a worm - every living creature breathes! &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;I see that you=\r\n have merely given what you consider your understanding, in which case I ha=\r\nve no further points to make except rejecting your understanding.

Idea=\r\nlly, ajna should be awakened to some extent before mooladhara, in order to =\r\nallow an unaffected perception of the energies manifested by mooladhara and=\r\n the lower chakras. However, the awakening of mooladhara will help to furth=\r\ner awaken ajna. In fact, the best way to bring about awakening of ajna is t=\r\nhrough the practices of moola bandha and ashwini mudra which are specific f=\r\nor mooladhara.. ..&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Well, thanks for the quote. However, t=\r\nhis does not say that &quot;awakening&quot; of one will automatically &quot;awaken&quot; the ot=\r\nher. It says, in an ideal case one should &quot;awaken&quot; Agya chakra to some exte=\r\nnt before trying to awaken Mooladhara chakra. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n In a lot of people chakras remain &quot;awakened in various degrees&quot;without any=\r\n conscinous effort. Rarely would an individual appear who have absolutely z=\r\nero awakening of all chakras. In most cases, &quot;partially awakenend&quot; chakras =\r\ndo exist, but I am not sure if that is of any significant\n help in practica=\r\nl spirituality.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Plus, this is one of the possi=\r\nble paths of progess in Yoga, not the only one possible. Hence, we should n=\r\not jump to conclusions which are not explicitly stated. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbs=\r\np;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; A fact, required to understand why Ganesh, deity of Mooladhara, =\r\nis worshipped first.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ganesha is worsh=\r\nipped first because it presides over the Mooladhara, not because mooladhara=\r\n has a connection with Agya. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Regarding the 6t=\r\nh tattwa there is nothing new to it, it already exists, Yogananda writes in=\r\n his commentary the following:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;...Beyond the subtlest phy=\r\nsical vibration (akasha, ether), Paramahansa Yogananda explained, is the su=\r\nperether,&quot; a finer manifestation and therefore not classified as one of the=\r\n physical vibratory elements (tattvas), of which there are only five-earth,=\r\n water, fire, air, ether. Some yoga treatises define this tattwa as\n mind, =\r\nor &#39;non-matter&#39; , as opposed to matter or gross vibration... .&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; I am sorry, but the above quote is a little vague. It no where mentio=\r\nns that Chitta is a 6th tattwa. What it does it says about the 5 gross elem=\r\nents and &quot;a finer manifestation&quot; . Maybe the intented audience for this pas=\r\nsage was one who is not intellectually aware of the basic=C3=82&nbsp;idea o=\r\nf five creative elements. Otherwise, the &quot;super-ether&quot; needs more clarity. =\r\nIs it prakiriti? It is Chitta? Is it really sixth or does the six have more=\r\n subsets? Is he calling it a vague six because we cannot be aware of the hi=\r\ngher tattwas beyond the five, therefore clubbing everything together into o=\r\nne?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; As you mentioned Samkhya, it uses a calssi=\r\nfication of the universe in 24 tattwas with 5 which cause physical manifest=\r\nations to occur. It is still not 6 by any measure.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; Again in Kasmiri Shaivism, they define 36 tattwas! That is why the\n ne=\r\ned to be technically precise so that we may not misunderstand each other.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The tattwas are 5 in number as per multipl=\r\ne Hindu scriptures, both &gt; Agamas/Nigamas as well as Upanishads.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Which scriptures ? Quotes ? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Check t=\r\nhe quotation given by Sundeep right at the begining of this set of mails. A=\r\nre you questioning the veracity of scriptures or the fact that they mention=\r\n creation is caused by five gross elements?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; It is=\r\n through Sankhya, that you can understand why Chitta is related to it. &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; As I said before, no one is denying the existence=\r\n of Chitta. One is however questioning whether Chitta is a &#39;6th element&#39; . =\r\nIf you take Samkhya, there are 24 elements, of which 5 are basic. And the r=\r\nest are subtle. So when normal creation is spoken of, it is spoken off in t=\r\nerms of 5 elements and not 6. When the essence of spirituality is spoken of=\r\nf\n right upto the state of God, then we go into 24 or 36 (depending on your=\r\n classification) . Further, in the 36 element lists, the &quot;suddha-tattwas&quot; a=\r\nre defined as unknowable from this plane of existence. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; As Narasimha knows Jyotish shastra also, he =\r\ncould probably figure out the rashi to which the 6th tattwa is attributed s=\r\nince I have already given the table out, so it is as real as it rises daily=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Umm, with due respect, no it is not yet easy. Lot of haz=\r\ny areas yet. Kindly check above.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rega=\r\nrds,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Nitish&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com,=\r\n rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ ...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; De=\r\nar Nitish,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Allow me i=\r\nnterject in your conversation with Narasimha.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; You mentioned:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Thus, the highest Ajna is\n connected to the lowest Mool=\r\nadhara and the awakening of one of them affects the other, a fact rather we=\r\nll-documented in Yoga books.

Let us be technically precise and not use terms lo=\r\nosely to avoid confusion. What is the &quot;awakening&quot; of a chakra? What does it=\r\n mean by &quot;affecting&quot;?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n The diagrams, not just by Lahiri Mahasaya but even other books, explain th=\r\ne connection of the nadis etc, but no where in his description of spiritual=\r\n progess (from the 26 dairies of Lahiri Mahasaya) does he say that awakenin=\r\ng of the agya chakra will automatically awaken the mooladhara. If you can p=\r\nrovide an exact quote with page number and name of the book, I will try and=\r\n check. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; He explains =\r\nin\n details about the &quot;granthi bhedans&quot; before one goes into actually awake=\r\nning=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp; any chakra for that matter. These granthis =\r\nhave a specific format in which they have to be pierced as per Lahiri Mahas=\r\naya and it is here that a connection is drawn between Agya and Mooladhara w=\r\nith Manipura in the centre. Not in the actual act of &quot;awakening a chakra&quot;, =\r\nif I use the same definitions as used in=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp; the boo=\r\nk by Lahiri Mahasaya himself.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Gunas, by inherent dualit=\r\ny in nature, give rise to the 6 tattwas, that is as simple. Now, the spirit=\r\nual law of duality is very well described by the two birds analogy, as well=\r\n as the 3 gunas are very well mentioned in the upanishads. Isn&#39;t it ?&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Can you quote a scripture which says there are 6 tattwas? Ta=\r\nttwa has a very specific technical meaning. When you say that Gunas by &quot;inh=\r\nerent\n duality&quot; in nature give rise to 6 tattwas, I guess you are using a s=\r\nimple multiplication of 3 x 2 and arriving at six. My question, then why no=\r\nt a simple 3 raised to the power 2 resulting in 9 tattwas?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; No, this is not really a case of basi=\r\nc maths I presume. The scriptures are clear that there are exactly 5 tattwa=\r\ns, not more. Chitta is not a tattwa. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Thus, all our experiences of matter are through non-materi=\r\nal Chitta, and it doesn&#39;t imply that 6th tattwa doesn&#39;t exist. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; No one denies the existence of C=\r\nhitta, but the scriptures do not bracket it as a &quot;tattwa&quot;. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The tattwas are 5 in number as per=\r\n multiple Hindu scriptures, both Agamas/Nigamas as well as Upanishads.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n =\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) i=\r\ns Bhairava - Shiva Sutra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 1/10/09, ye=\r\neahoo_99 &lt;nitish.arya@ ...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; From: yeeahoo_99 &lt;nitish.arya@ ...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: [ved=\r\nic-wisdom] Re: Order of Creation, Physics &amp; Reality&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To: ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, 1 October, 2009, =\r\n10:33 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbs=\r\np; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; || OM TAT SAT ||=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 3 Gunas, by inherent duality in =\r\nnature, give rise to the 6 tattwas, that is as simple.
