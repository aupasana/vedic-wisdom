If the person giving that knowledge also has an individualized co=\r\nnsciousness, the kaarmik debt is formed between the two individualized cons=\r\nciousnesses and stored in the corresponding kaarana sareeras (causal bodies=\r\n). The magnitude of the debt is based on a combination of how important the=\r\n receiver and the giver considered the thing that was exchanged.\n \nOn the o=\r\nther hand, if the giver of knowledge is a jeevanmukta without an individual=\r\nized consciousness, whose kaarana sareera has been completely burnt, then t=\r\nhe kaarmik debt of the person receiving knowledge is formed with the univer=\r\nse and not with a single soul.\n \nDo not worry much about the debt to me or =\r\nother givers of knowledge who just put something out on the internet for th=\r\nousands to benefit from. The best way to pay back the little debt to me is =\r\nto help others. Share your knowledge with others selflessly and without pri=\r\nde. Help some people with the knowledge. I, for example, get a lot of peopl=\r\ne who want chart readings and I cannot help all of them. I spend more time =\r\nsharing knowledge than giving readings, because hundred people with the kno=\r\nwledge can help more people than I can.\n \nGving Jyotish knowledge and spiri=\r\ntual knowledge to as many people as you can serves another purpose. If you =\r\nwere to come back to earth again, there will be a safety net. Even if you a=\r\nre born in a country/family where there is no exposure to such knowledge, N=\r\nature will send someone to you and put you on the right track. Your current=\r\n karmas become blessings in a future life. Create a huge safety net of bles=\r\nsings!\n \nWe incur many debts to many people while on earth. Counting all of=\r\n them, accounting for them and planning in such a way that one is debt free=\r\n is nearly impossible. The best option is to be selfless, avoid pride, be h=\r\nappy with what one has, help as many as possible and humbly keep rememberin=\r\ng every now and then that the Lord is the real doer of all actions.\n \n*    =\r\n    *        *\n \nBTW, one request to those who value my words: Never sell d=\r\nivine knowledge. Divine knowledge is a brahminical thing and selling is a v=\r\naisya trait. Do not mix them. Selling spiritual knowledge or Jyotish knowle=\r\ndge is one of the terrible karmas. If anybody who received such knowledge f=\r\nrom me is selling it, I too will get a small part of the bad karma, for tea=\r\nching to an unworthy person. I am taking a calculated risk by putting Jyoti=\r\nsh/spiritual knowledge on internet where I do not even see/know most of the=\r\n receivers. If you do not sell or otherwise abuse that knowledge, you will =\r\nbe helping me and, of course, helping yourself even more.\n \nBest regards,\nN=\r\narasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri T=\r\narpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http=\r\n://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://v=\r\nedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWrit=\r\nings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n  ----- Orig=\r\ninal Message ----- \n\n        Namaskaram Narasimha\n\n\n        This is my firs=\r\nt email to you.
