And now after 7 years although\n\nm=\r\nuch of family & fincancial issue are still there but I feel very\n\ncontented=\r\n & calm.

He will still say that this is my\n\ncomparativ=\r\ne judgment but it may be different for you.=C3=82  So best you\n\ntry out and=\r\n read his post on spiritual progress and judge what works\n\nbetter for you, =\r\nor you want both.\n\n&gt; Now on my experience, I learnt SK in 2002 and within 2=\r\n5 days learnt\n\nPS. =C3=82 I have practiced both regularly for 1 years and S=\r\nK alone for 7\n\nyears. I have done Advance course 8 times. Also have listen =\r\nNarad Bhakti\n\nSutra, Astavakra Geeta etc. As you mentioned that AOL service=\r\n is\n\nconsidered very important part, I had also done lots of volunteering\n\n=\r\nactivities in AOL including being Administrator for Primary School.\n\nSince =\r\n2009, I have stopped practicing SK, as I felt that I after initial\n\ncouple =\r\nof years of progress, I did not find progressing much on\n\nspiritual level. =\r\nI found really helpful in stress relief and mental\n\ncalmness, but considere=\r\nd commodity/retail spirituality.\n\n&gt; Now from last 10 months, by taking Gana=\r\npathi as Guru, I have started\n\ndoing japa every day and homam every weekend=\r\n. I have not spent equal\n\namount of time in Homam as in SK practice to give=\r\n you comparison. Yes,\n\nit will take longer than SK to master the technique,=\r\n and initially mind\n\nis more occupied in maintaining the fire.\n\n&gt; So can on=\r\nly say, if you like in the reasoning and explanation of\n\nNarasimha ji, bett=\r\ner try yourself and see how you feel. Anyway, AoL also\n\nteaches Agnihotra, =\r\nand also homam in their Veda school. During Navaratri\n\nin Bangalore ashram =\r\nthere are all the homam done.

I think you are treating him as Spiritual&lt;br&gt;\nConsultant.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; Anyway, as Narasimha ji has said it is finally individual preferen=\r\nce.&lt;br&gt;\nSo even he try out on request, what do you expect him to say one is=\r\n 80%&lt;br&gt;\neffective, same, or 110% effective. He will still say that this is=\r\n my&lt;br&gt;\ncomparative judgment but it may be different for you.=C3=82  So bes=\r\nt you&lt;br&gt;\ntry out and read his post on spiritual progress and judge what wo=\r\nrks&lt;br&gt;\nbetter for you, or you want both.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Now on my experience, I =\r\nlearnt SK in 2002 and within 25 days learnt&lt;br&gt;\nPS. =C3=82 I have practiced=\r\n both regularly for 1 years and SK alone for 7&lt;br&gt;\nyears. I have done Advan=\r\nce course 8 times. Also have listen Narad Bhakti&lt;br&gt;\nSutra, Astavakra Geeta=\r\n etc. As you mentioned that AOL service is&lt;br&gt;\nconsidered very important pa=\r\nrt, I had also done lots of volunteering&lt;br&gt;\nactivities in AOL including be=\r\ning Administrator for Primary School.&lt;br&gt;\nSince 2009, I have stopped practi=\r\ncing SK, as I felt that I after initial&lt;br&gt;\ncouple of years of progress, I =\r\ndid not find progressing much on&lt;br&gt;\nspiritual level. I found really helpfu=\r\nl in stress relief and mental&lt;br&gt;\ncalmness, but considered commodity/retail=\r\n spirituality.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Now from last 10 months, by taking Ganapathi as Gur=\r\nu, I have started&lt;br&gt;\ndoing japa every day and homam every weekend. I have =\r\nnot spent equal&lt;br&gt;\namount of time in Homam as in SK practice to give you c=\r\nomparison. Yes,&lt;br&gt;\nit will take longer than SK to master the technique, an=\r\nd initially mind&lt;br&gt;\nis more occupied in maintaining the fire.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; So =\r\ncan only say, if you like in the reasoning and explanation of&lt;br&gt;\nNarasimha=\r\n ji, better try yourself and see how you feel. Anyway, AoL also&lt;br&gt;\nteaches=\r\n Agnihotra, and also homam in their Veda school. During Navaratri&lt;br&gt;\nin Ba=\r\nngalore ashram there are all the homam done.
