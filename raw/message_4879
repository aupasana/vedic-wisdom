Further i feel it contain=\r\ns some key without which the mere sadna of saptashati cannot be able to ful=\r\nly get the  results that saptashati contains :-) so i trust fully on words =\r\nof shiva when he says kunjika on its own gives the full results of saptasha=\r\nti and also saptashati without kunjika cannot give complete results :-)\n\nOn=\r\n Wed Sep 15th, 2010 8:18 AM EDT rajarshi14 wrote:\n\n&gt;Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt;In differen=\r\nt paramparas, different theories are propagated relating to Kunjika Stotra.=\r\n In some paramparas, specially in North India, it is consider to be equal t=\r\no the Saptasati. Where as in eastern India, Bengal/Assam areas, and also so=\r\nme Kaula sampradayas in Varanasi, this is not considered to be equal to Sap=\r\ntasati. \n&gt;\n&gt;The reasons why these sampradayas do not consider KS to be equa=\r\nl to Saptasati is the same as what Narasimha stated. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In my personal e=\r\nxperience, about a year before I actually started reading the full Saptasat=\r\ni, I used to do the KS for a few months. I was shown a specific method of c=\r\nhanting the KS - there is some breath control required at certain lines etc=\r\n etc. I had almost mugged it up. But the experience of chanting the actual =\r\nSaptashati (full) is vastly more powerful and different than the KS. I have=\r\n serious doubts whether a person doing only the KS can ever experience sama=\r\ndhi at all; whereas the Saptasati by itself is capable of bestowing the hig=\r\nhest and varied types of spiritual experiences to a sadhaka. Therefore, I t=\r\nend to agree with the sampradayas from Bengal and Assam that the actual Sap=\r\ntasati is anytime more powerful than the KS when it comes to spiritual expe=\r\nriences. KS is about siddhis. That too, not a simple straight chanting but =\r\nwith some modulations, breath controls etc etc which have to be learnt from=\r\n someone qualified.\n&gt;\n&gt;Just my 2 cents on the topic.\n&gt;\n&gt;-Regards\n&gt; Rajarshi=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shashi_nambisan&quot; &lt;shashin@.=\r\n..&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;&gt;    Thanks a lot.

I am afraid it=\r\n is a coded prayer. It contains hints in coded form for several specific sa=\r\ndhanas to get specific results using Devi Saptashati.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;  \n&gt;&gt; &gt; From that=\r\n point of view, one can understand why it says there is no siddhi without K=\r\nunjika stotra. However, one will almost certainly not get siddhi by merely =\r\nchanting Kunjika stotra or adding it to one&#39;s Saptashati chanting. In fact,=\r\n siddhi often comes to those who do not consciously pursue it.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;  \n&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n*        *        *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;  \n&gt;&gt; &gt; If one says &quot;just spending time with your m=\r\nother and expressing your love and respect for her will not give you her we=\r\nalth. You need her checkbook to access her wealth&quot;, that is not incorrect. =\r\nBut that is not the complete story. Just by having the checkbook of one&#39;s m=\r\nother, one may not be able to get her wealth. Check needs her signature. On=\r\n the other hand, a simple child who does not consciously or explicitly try =\r\nto get the wealth of one&#39;s mother and only spends time with mother expressi=\r\nng love and respect from her may end up getting her wealth when she decides=\r\n by herself to give.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;  \n&gt;&gt; &gt; In fact, I suggest not being a son who loo=\r\nks to get mother&#39;s wealth by laying hands on her checkbook. Just cultivate =\r\nlove for mother and devote yourself to her.
