For example, Ramakrishna Paramahams=\r\na said that Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was one of the seven great ris=\r\nhis. Many people did meet him. Thus, meeting the physical manifestation of =\r\nan amsa of a rishi is not that difficult (though that also requires some pu=\r\nnya).\n=C2=A0\nThe second thing is to meet the physical manifestation of the =\r\nentire consciousness of a rishi. *That* is very very very difficult. As Vim=\r\nalananda said, that may require a terrific amount of tapascharya (unless yo=\r\nu are one of that rishi&#39;s people who came to do some work on earth and have=\r\n already done a terrific amount of tapascharya in past lives).\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nOne may wonder: If rishis are so great, why do they not =\r\nget moksha and why do they remain in physical manifestation?\n=C2=A0\nThough =\r\nthe following is essentially like a kindergartener explaining Einstein&#39;s th=\r\neory of general relativity to fellow kindergarteners, I will nevertheless t=\r\nry to explain it.\n=C2=A0\nAll that our senses perceive is Maya (delusion) th=\r\nat is created by the power of duality. If the veil of delusion is removed, =\r\nthere is no duality and all is ONE uniform and undivided consciousness, kno=\r\nwn variously as Aatman or Brahman or Narayana or Sadashiva. This one unifor=\r\nm and undivided consciousness is known as &quot;unmanifested Brahman&quot;. The world=\r\n of duality, where there are many different objects, is also actually Brahm=\r\nan only, but Brahman that went through some modification and manifestation.=\r\n It is known as &quot;manifested Brahman&quot;. Both are Brahman only.\n=C2=A0\nNormall=\r\ny, living in the domain of duality without being deluded by some aspect of =\r\nduality or the other is near to impossible. Remaining in duality with a per=\r\nfect understanding of the underlying oneness of all objects and perceiving =\r\nall those objects of duality without experiencing attraction or repulsion f=\r\nor any single object of duality is almost impossible. Most spiritual aspira=\r\nnts try to reach the state of oneness with unmanifested Brahman - a state i=\r\nn which there is no duality and no objectification - and become absorbed in=\r\n that state forever. That is the advaitic experience of &quot;nirvikalpa samadhi=\r\n&quot; and what happens in &quot;moksha&quot;.\n=C2=A0\nHowever, maharshis have described hi=\r\ngher states. It is possible to be in oneness with manifested Brahman and un=\r\nmanifested Brahman at the same time. It is possible to remain in duality, w=\r\nith the senses perceiving objects of duality, and yet remain in oneness wit=\r\nh the underlying oneness (Brahman) of all obejcts and not be deluded, i.e. =\r\nnot experience either attraction or repulsion for any object of duality. Me=\r\nre perception of objects by the senses is not the problem. The tendency of =\r\nmind to be find some attractive and find some repulsive is the problem. It =\r\nis possible to remain in a state where there is neither attraction nor repu=\r\nlsion for any object is possible.\n=C2=A0\nSuch a state is experienced by ver=\r\ny few beings. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Shirdi Sai Baba etc were in this sta=\r\nte always. Swami Vivekananda also experienced it.\n=C2=A0\nRishis are beings =\r\nwho are always in a very high state. They are always alert to the maya and =\r\nyet not stuck in it. They perceive objects of duality and yet are not attra=\r\ncted or repelled by anything. If one overcomes attraction and repulsion and=\r\n yet remains in duality, one can pretty much do anything. But because one i=\r\ns neither attracted or repelled by anything, it means one has no personal e=\r\ngo and one has no reason to do anything for personal ego. Then one becomes =\r\nan instrument of nature (Prakriti) and implements the wish of nature throug=\r\nh one&#39;s actions, which are performed without any attachment or personal ide=\r\nntification. One who has a personal=C2=A0ego can do limited things. One who=\r\n has a very very small ego can do great things. One who has no ego can do A=\r\nNY thing. But such a being does things that are desired by Nature - the nat=\r\nural order of the universe. They can change the course of history of nation=\r\ns and planets.\n=C2=A0\nA rishi in this state may engage in various actions o=\r\nf great consequence for the world. Yet, there is no attachment with the act=\r\nions. He is just an unattached instrument of Nature.\n=C2=A0\nIf one gets out=\r\n of the duality and becomes absorbed in unmanifested Brahman forever, one i=\r\ns not born again. But a rishi who has an equal vision of unmanifested and m=\r\nanifested Brahman is for ever mukta (liberated). Thus, he will freely inter=\r\nact with duality without any fear or aversion. Amsa of such a rishi may eve=\r\nn be born again as a separate person, just as a process running in a comput=\r\ner may spawn off a separate thread to do some focussed task. Even if the co=\r\nmputer process has finished all the initialization and early work, the newl=\r\ny spawned thread has to go through initialization etc again. Similarly, the=\r\n person born with amsa has to go through the process of overcoming weakness=\r\nes and realizing self all over=C2=A0again. When a Vivekananda is born from =\r\nthe amsa of a rishi, he may have to struggle initially and overcome the wea=\r\nknesses and realize self all over again. But he is the amsa of an ever free=\r\n and liberated being and will find his way again.\n=C2=A0\nThus, a liberated =\r\nrishi, with the force of his liberated consciousness and with the force of =\r\nhis reborn amsas, will act as an unattached instrument of Nature performing=\r\n actions of tremendous consequences without any personal ego driving those =\r\nactions.\n=C2=A0\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nWorshipping the rishi of one&#39;s gotr=\r\na and getting his blessings is a very good idea. In general, getting the bl=\r\nessings of ANY rishi is a great idea. Pursuing the rishi of one&#39;s gotra is =\r\nrelatively easier for most people. But, if one has a connection with a spec=\r\nific rishi (apart from the rishi of one&#39;s gotra), one can worship that rish=\r\ni. However, it is not easy to know that.\n=C2=A0\nSuppose several mantras you=\r\n find natural attraction for have the descendants of a specific Maharshi as=\r\n the rishi. Then you may have a connection with that Maharshi. You can try =\r\npraying to him.\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- ---------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: htt=\r\np://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.=\r\nVedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group=\r\n/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast.=\r\n net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri J=\r\nagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n\n\n----- Original=\r\n Message ----- \nFrom: rajarshi nandy \nTo: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \nS=\r\nent: Thursday, September 25, 2008 1:30 AM\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: A=\r\nnyone knows mantra for Kashyap Rishi?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Narasimhaji\n=C2=A0\nI had a=\r\n question about Rishis.

Most spiritual aspirants try to reach the state of oneness =\r\nwith unmanifested Brahman - a state in which there is no duality and no obj=\r\nectification - and become absorbed in that state forever. That is the advai=\r\ntic experience of &quot;nirvikalpa samadhi&quot; and what happens in &quot;moksha&quot;.&lt;/FONT&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt;However, maharshis have described higher states. It is po=\r\nssible to be in oneness with manifested Brahman and unmanifested Brahman at=\r\n the same time. It is possible to remain in duality, with the senses percei=\r\nving objects of duality, and yet remain in oneness with the underlying onen=\r\ness (Brahman) of all obejcts and not be deluded, i.e. not experience either=\r\n attraction or repulsion for any object of duality. Mere perception of obje=\r\ncts by the senses is not the problem. The tendency of mind to be find some =\r\nattractive and find some repulsive is the problem. It is possible to remain=\r\n in a state where there is neither attraction nor repulsion for any object =\r\nis possible.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Such a state is experienced by very fe=\r\nw beings. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Shirdi Sai Baba etc were in this state a=\r\nlways. Swami Vivekananda also experienced it.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Rish=\r\nis are beings who are always in a very high state. They are always alert to=\r\n the maya and yet not stuck in it. They perceive objects of duality and yet=\r\n are not attracted or repelled by anything. If one overcomes attraction and=\r\n repulsion and yet remains in duality, one can pretty much do anything. But=\r\n because one is neither attracted or repelled by anything, it means one has=\r\n no personal ego and one has no reason to do anything for personal ego. The=\r\nn one becomes an instrument of nature (Prakriti) and implements the wish of=\r\n nature through one&#39;s actions, which are performed without any attachment o=\r\nr personal identification. One who has a personal&nbsp;ego can do limited t=\r\nhings. One who has a very very small ego can do great things. One who has n=\r\no ego can do ANY thing. But such a being does things that are desired by Na=\r\nture - the natural order of the universe. They can change the course of his=\r\ntory of nations and\n planets.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;A rishi in this state=\r\n may engage in various actions of great consequence for the world. Yet, the=\r\nre is no attachment with the actions. He is just an unattached instrument o=\r\nf Nature.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;If one gets out of the duality and become=\r\ns absorbed in unmanifested Brahman forever, one is not born again. But a ri=\r\nshi who has an equal vision of unmanifested and manifested Brahman is for e=\r\nver mukta (liberated). Thus, he will freely interact with duality without a=\r\nny fear or aversion. Amsa of such a rishi may even be born again as a separ=\r\nate person, just as a process running in a computer may spawn off a separat=\r\ne thread to do some focussed task. Even if the computer process has finishe=\r\nd all the initialization and early work, the newly spawned thread has to go=\r\n through initialization etc again. Similarly, the person born with amsa has=\r\n to go through the process of overcoming weaknesses and realizing self all =\r\nover&nbsp;again. When a Vivekananda is born from the amsa of a rishi, he ma=\r\ny have to struggle initially and overcome the weaknesses and realize self a=\r\nll over again. But he is the amsa of an ever free and liberated being and\n =\r\nwill find his way again.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Thus, a liberated rishi, w=\r\nith the force of his liberated consciousness and with the force of his rebo=\r\nrn amsas, will act as an unattached instrument of Nature performing actions=\r\n of tremendous consequences without any personal ego driving those actions.=\r\n&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =\r\n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT=\r\n face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2=\r\n&gt;Worshipping the rishi of one&#39;s gotra and getting his blessings is a very g=\r\nood idea.
