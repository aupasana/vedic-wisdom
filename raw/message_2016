Also, he need not be talking about somebody &quot;connected to=\r\n&quot; his ashram. Moreover, when it comes to great lineages, there are connecti=\r\nons between all. For example, Aurobindo used to visit the house of Sister N=\r\nivedita, the foremost disciple of Swami Vivekananda and knew her well when =\r\nhe still lived in Calcutta. He had a vision in his prison cell of Swami Viv=\r\nekananda, just a few years after his death, in which he imparted Aurobindo =\r\nsome key knowledge. Paramahamsa Yogananda grew up in Calcutta and learnt Sa=\r\nnskrit from M, who was a sishya of Ramakrishna and wrote the gospel of Rama=\r\nkrishna. Trilinga Swami sent a tantra teacher to Ramakrishna to expand his =\r\nknowledge. Trilinga Swami knew Lahiri mahashaya and admired him. And so on.=\r\n\n \nComing back to the main point, the supermind established in the field of=\r\n earth that was referred to by Aurobindo can simply be a maharshi paying so=\r\nme attention to matters on earth. A maharshi absorbed in the divine in one =\r\nof the higher planes of consciousness can accomplish huge changes on earth =\r\nby the mere power of his thought. If there is a divine play to make some po=\r\nsitive changes on earth and a maharshi takes part in the play, he may focus=\r\n a small part of his supermind on the affairs of earth and direct a few imp=\r\nortant souls to do some key work. Some important souls (deities, rishis or =\r\nyogis etc) may send their amshas (partial essence) to be born on earth to f=\r\nulfil different parts of a divine play.\n \nYou may then see several (not jus=\r\nt one) elevated beings, enlightened beings and realized beings born on eart=\r\nh to bring clarity in different aspects of spiritual knowledge. Each of the=\r\nm will get specific internal/external guidance from the divine, based on wh=\r\nat their part in the play is.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThe &quot;Asura of Falseho=\r\nod&quot; that Aurobindo alluded to is all around us. At the subtlest level, he m=\r\nanifests as false ego in pretty much everybody. At the grossest level, he m=\r\nanifests as blatant lies, wrong propaganda etc.\n \nOne should not tolerate t=\r\nhis Asura (demon) and fight hard. However, one should not hate this Asura o=\r\nr those afflicted by him. When we encounter lies, we should fight and stand=\r\n for truth but not hate the liar at the same time. There is nothing that ne=\r\neds to be hated in this world. One should learn to do the job assigned to o=\r\nne by Nature without attraction or repulsion to anything or anybody and wit=\r\nh unconditional love (i.e. no expectations of a return) to all.\n \n&gt; This wa=\r\ns a very interesting read and matches what Narasimhaji\n&gt; says about changes=\r\n coming in the world.\n \nI know very little. But I was told that an age that=\r\n is somewhat like the bygone ages will be established on earth for a few hu=\r\nndred years in the coming decades. The reason the Divine Mother appeared be=\r\nfore Manish and asked him to spread simple homam procedures in the world wa=\r\ns to prepare the grounds for that.

I am posting it here for anyone interested.\n\n                Near the b=\r\neginning of the 20th century the great Indian freedom fighter and yogi-sage=\r\n, Sri Aurobindo, began to express a truth which had not been expressed befo=\r\nre. In his high states of divine union he saw that the time had come for a =\r\nnew stage in the evolution of mankind. He saw that the divine was to manife=\r\nst right here on Earth and that the time for this divine emergence into Ear=\r\nth life was now. He spoke of heaven descending to Earth, even as Earth expe=\r\nrienced a breakdown due to the intrinsic resistance held within her materia=\r\nl body towards this =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD\n                =EF=BF=BD\n  =\r\n              Sri Aurobindo was joined in Pondicherry, India, by a French m=\r\nystic, Mirra Alfassa, who later became known as the Mother. Together they e=\r\nmbarked on a journey of intensive cellular transformation that is very rele=\r\nvant to the colossal uncertainties we face today.\n                =EF=BF=BD=\r\n\n                Sri Aurobindo saw that the divine force permeates all matt=\r\ner, and that all matter therefore has a force of consciousness. The process=\r\n of the divine spirit descending down into matter is called involution. The=\r\n process by which the divine ascends back upwards out of matter is called e=\r\nvolution. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a stage where th=\r\nese two events are occurring simultaneously, and in his inner visions, he f=\r\noresaw that we would soon be experiencing a descent of what he called =EF=\r\n=BF=BDsupramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=BD that would entirely c=\r\nhange everything on Earth.\n                =EF=BF=BD\n                Man=EF=\r\n=BF=BDs greatness is not in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in what he =\r\nmakes possible. An immortal soul is somewhere within him, even if seldom ac=\r\ntive in most people, while an eternal spirit overshadows him, even if obstr=\r\nucted from descent by the hard lid of his constructed personality. There is=\r\n a great divine plan in motion, even if the evidence of the outer senses se=\r\nems to contradict it.\n\n                Sri Aurobindo recognized that humank=\r\nind is going through an evolutionary crisis. A stage has been reached in wh=\r\nich the human mind has made tremendous strides on the one hand, but is left=\r\n hopelessly inadequate to prevent its own extinction as a species. Meanwhil=\r\ne, as the Mother testified before her death in 1973, a consciousness higher=\r\n than the human rational mind, what may be termed the Supermind, has recent=\r\nly been established in the fields of the Earth, and is active there. Our ta=\r\nsk now is to bring it down into cellular consciousness.\n\n                Ev=\r\nolution took a great leap forward with the origins of Life, and later with =\r\nthe emergence of Mind. We are now at the threshold of another leap forward,=\r\n even more momentous, as we prepare for the emergence of the Supermind. Sri=\r\n Aurobindo speaks about four stages of human evolution, which we will soon =\r\nbe starting to experience concurrently upon Earth. The first is =EF=BF=BDan=\r\nimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current species, a rational being possessing an in=\r\ndividualized soul, but largely obstructed from contacting and merging with =\r\nit.\n                =EF=BF=BD\n                Next is the =EF=BF=BDhuman hu=\r\nman,=EF=BF=BD a species that is spontaneous-ly coming to birth under the in=\r\nfluence of an ever-expanding supramental field, a being that is largely abl=\r\ne to merge and live from soul-consciousness rather than mind-consciousness.=\r\n \n\n                Thirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still=\r\n inhabit a dense physical body, but will be in possession of the Mind of Li=\r\nght, which is supramental consciousness that has begun to merge with cellul=\r\nar consciousness. \n\n                Finally, our ultimate goal as a species=\r\n is the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity incarnated fully with=\r\nin the subtle realms of matter. This will be a race of what we could call =\r\n=EF=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In this species, the unity of matter a=\r\nnd spirit would be fully realized upon Earth.\n\n                The great wo=\r\nrk of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was in bringing supramental consciousnes=\r\ns down into the cellular consciousness of their own bodies. Since this is a=\r\n unified consciousness, this meant that the supramental consciousness was s=\r\nimultaneously being brought into the consciousness fields of the Earth, awa=\r\niting the moment when it would flower into its full manifestation in collec=\r\ntive matter.\n                Whenever there is a =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD =\r\nthere is corresponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo and the Mother speak of th=\r\neir experience with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD essentially anti-div=\r\nine forces, at work in the world today. There is the Asura of Darkness, the=\r\n Asura of Suffering, The Asura of Falsehood, and the Asura of Death. These =\r\nare the forces that are so outwardly apparent, and which seem to be in cont=\r\nrol of current global events. According to them the Asura of Darkness (Luci=\r\nfer?) has gone through a transformation recently, and the Asura of Sufferin=\r\ng has returned to Source, and so only the latter two still remain to wreak =\r\nhavoc on Earth. Interestingly, they spoke of the Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=\r\n=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during World War II, and of their own=\r\n intensive inner work in countering his influence. It would not be difficul=\r\nt to see how this same Asura may be influencing other world leaders in the =\r\ncurrent political sphere.\n\n                With the descent of this new vib=\r\nratory consciousness all our old obsolete human structures will be demolish=\r\ned. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that although the changes will be eno=\r\nrmous they would not be necessarily catastrophic. The power of Truth automa=\r\ntically erases Falsehood, and our world for the most part consists of False=\r\nhood. Yet, the Supramental, he maintained, carried a power of harmonization=\r\n which could overcome this resistance by means other than dramatic struggle=\r\n and violence. The Asuras will eventually be absorbed into their original e=\r\nmanations of Light, Life, Beauty, and Truth. It may be interesting to specu=\r\nlate, with all the violence in the world today, the destruction we might ha=\r\nve experienced if not for this power of harmonization!\n\n                Whe=\r\nn does all this happen? Sri Aurobindo and the Mother believed that the worl=\r\nd stage was set for this quantum descent, and that it was quite imminent. T=\r\nhe Mother said in 1968 that the supramental transformation was a certainty =\r\nnow, and that it would come about with a minimum of destruction, =EF=BF=BDa=\r\nlthough this minimum is still considerable.=EF=BF=BD She said that the year=\r\n 2000 would be a turning point.\n\n                This was a very interestin=\r\ng read and matches what Narasimhaji says about changes coming in the world.=\r\n\n\n                -Regards\n                 Rajarshi\n\n                The u=\r\npsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra \n       \n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_01DD_01C9F2CC.CDA591C0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;utf-8&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n=EF=BB=BF&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HT=\r\nML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Du=\r\ntf-8&quot;&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;.ygrp-photo-title {\n\tCLEAR: both; FONT-SIZE: =\r\nsmaller; OVERFLOW: hidden; WIDTH: 75px; HEIGHT: 15px; TEXT-ALIGN: center\n}\n=\r\nDIV.ygrp-photo {\n\tBORDER-RIGHT: black 1px solid; BACKGROUND-POSITION: cente=\r\nr 50%; BORDER-TOP: black 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: black 1px solid; WIDTH: 62=\r\npx; BORDER-BOTTOM: black 1px solid; BACKGROUND-REPEAT: no-repeat; HEIGHT: 6=\r\n2px; BACKGROUND-COLOR: white\n}\nDIV.photo-title A {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}=\r\n\nDIV.photo-title A:active {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV.photo-title A:hove=\r\nr {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV.photo-title A:visited {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: =\r\nnone\n}\nDIV.attach-table DIV.attach-row {\n\tCLEAR: both\n}\nDIV.attach-table DI=\r\nV.attach-row DIV {\n\tFLOAT: left\n}\nP {\n\tCLEAR: both; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; PAD=\r\nDING-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-BOTTOM: 3px; OVERFLOW: hidden; PADDING-TOP: 15px\n}\n=\r\nDIV.ygrp-file {\n\tWIDTH: 30px; valign: middle\n}\nDIV.attach-table DIV.attach-=\r\nrow DIV DIV A {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV.attach-table DIV.attach-row DI=\r\nV DIV SPAN {\n\tFONT-WEIGHT: normal\n}\nDIV.ygrp-file-title {\n\tFONT-WEIGHT: bol=\r\nd\n}\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;\n&lt;!--\n#ygrp-mkp{\n  border: 1px solid #=\r\nd8d8d8;\n  font-family: Arial;\n  margin: 14px 0px;\n  padding: 0px 14px;\n}\n#y=\r\ngrp-mkp hr{\n  border: 1px solid #d8d8d8;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #hd{\n  color: #628c2a;=\r\n\n  font-size: 85%;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  line-height: 122%;\n  margin: 10px=\r\n 0px;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #ads{\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad{\n  padding: =\r\n0 0;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad a{\n  color: #0000ff;\n  text-decoration: none;\n}\n--&gt;\n&lt;/=\r\nSTYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3562&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;B=\r\nODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DA=\r\nrial size=3D2&gt;Aurobindo need not be talking about a single \n&quot;savior&quot; the wa=\r\ny people may imagine.

In his high st=\r\nates of \n                divine union he saw that the time had come for a n=\r\new stage in \n                the evolution of mankind. He saw that the divi=\r\nne was to manifest \n                right here on Earth and that the time f=\r\nor this divine emergence \n                into Earth life was now. He spoke=\r\n of heaven descending to Earth, \n                even as Earth experienced =\r\na breakdown due to the intrinsic \n                resistance held within he=\r\nr material body towards this \n                =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;Sri Aurobindo was joined in Pondicherry, \n                Ind=\r\nia, by a French mystic, Mirra Alfassa, who later became known \n            =\r\n    as the Mother. Together they embarked on a journey of intensive \n      =\r\n          cellular transformation that is very relevant to the colossal \n  =\r\n              uncertainties we face today.&lt;BR&gt;=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;Sri Aurobindo sa=\r\nw that the \n                divine force permeates all matter, and that all=\r\n matter therefore \n                has a force of consciousness. The proces=\r\ns of the divine spirit \n                descending down into matter is call=\r\ned involution. The process by \n                which the divine ascends bac=\r\nk upwards out of matter is called \n                evolution. According to =\r\nSri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a \n                stage where these tw=\r\no events are occurring simultaneously, and \n                in his inner vi=\r\nsions, he foresaw that we would soon be \n                experiencing a des=\r\ncent of what he called =EF=BF=BDsupramental (or \n                monadic) c=\r\nonsciousness=EF=BF=BD that would entirely change everything on \n           =\r\n     Earth.&lt;BR&gt;=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;Man=EF=BF=BDs greatness is not in what he is, s=\r\nays Sri \n                Aurobindo, but in what he makes possible. An immor=\r\ntal soul is \n                somewhere within him, even if seldom active in=\r\n most people, \n                while an eternal spirit overshadows him, eve=\r\nn if obstructed from \n                descent by the hard lid of his constr=\r\nucted personality. There is \n                a great divine plan in motion,=\r\n even if the evidence of the outer \n                senses seems to contrad=\r\nict it.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;S=\r\nri Aurobindo recognized \n                that humankind is going through an=\r\n evolutionary crisis. A stage \n                has been reached in which th=\r\ne human mind has made tremendous \n                strides on the one hand, =\r\nbut is left hopelessly inadequate to \n                prevent its own extin=\r\nction as a species. Meanwhile, as the \n                Mother testified bef=\r\nore her death in 1973, a consciousness \n                higher than the hum=\r\nan rational mind, what may be termed the \n                Supermind, has re=\r\ncently been established in the fields of the \n                Earth, and is=\r\n active there. Our task now is to bring it down \n                into cellu=\r\nlar consciousness.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;Evolution took a great le=\r\nap forward with the origins of \n                Life, and later with the em=\r\nergence of Mind. We are now at the \n                threshold of another le=\r\nap forward, even more momentous, as we \n                prepare for the eme=\r\nrgence of the Supermind. Sri Aurobindo speaks \n                about four s=\r\ntages of human evolution, which we will soon be \n                starting t=\r\no experience concurrently upon Earth. The first is \n                =EF=BF=\r\n=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current species, a rational being possessing =\r\n\n                an individualized soul, but largely obstructed from contac=\r\nting \n                and merging with it.&lt;BR&gt;=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;Next is the =EF=\r\n=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a \n                species that is spontaneous-=\r\nly coming to birth under the \n                influence of an ever-expandin=\r\ng supramental field, a being that \n                is largely able to merge=\r\n and live from soul-consciousness rather \n                than mind-conscio=\r\nusness. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;Thirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who=\r\n will still inhabit a dense \n                physical body, but will be in =\r\npossession of the Mind of Light, \n                which is supramental cons=\r\nciousness that has begun to merge with \n                cellular consciousn=\r\ness. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;Finally, our ultimate goal as a species is the =\r\n=EF=BF=BDSupramental \n                Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity incarnated f=\r\nully within the subtle realms of \n                matter. This will be a ra=\r\nce of what we could call =EF=BF=BDDescended \n                Masters.=EF=BF=\r\n=BD In this species, the unity of matter and spirit would \n                =\r\nbe fully realized upon Earth.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;The great work=\r\n of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was in \n                bringing suprament=\r\nal consciousness down into the cellular \n                consciousness of t=\r\nheir own bodies. Since this is a unified \n                consciousness, th=\r\nis meant that the supramental consciousness was \n                simultaneo=\r\nusly being brought into the consciousness fields of \n                the Ea=\r\nrth, awaiting the moment when it would flower into its \n                ful=\r\nl manifestation in collective matter.&lt;BR&gt;Whenever there is a \n             =\r\n   =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is corresponding resistance. Sri Aurobin=\r\ndo and \n                the Mother speak of their experience with the four =\r\n=EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD \n                essentially anti-divine forces, =\r\nat work in the world today. \n                There is the Asura of Darkness=\r\n, the Asura of Suffering, The \n                Asura of Falsehood, and the =\r\nAsura of Death. These are the forces \n                that are so outwardly=\r\n apparent, and which seem to be in control \n                of current glob=\r\nal events. According to them the Asura of \n                Darkness (Lucife=\r\nr?) has gone through a transformation recently, \n                and the As=\r\nura of Suffering has returned to Source, and so only \n                the l=\r\natter two still remain to wreak havoc on Earth. \n                Interestin=\r\ngly, they spoke of the Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD \n   =\r\n             through Hitler during World War II, and of their own intensive=\r\n \n                inner work in countering his influence. It would not be \n=\r\n                difficult to see how this same Asura may be influencing oth=\r\ner \n                world leaders in the current political sphere.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;With the descent of this new vibratory consciousness=\r\n all \n                our old obsolete human structures will be demolished.=\r\n However, \n                Sri Aurobindo emphasized that although the chang=\r\nes will be \n                enormous they would not be necessarily catastro=\r\nphic. The power \n                of Truth automatically erases Falsehood, a=\r\nnd our world for the \n                most part consists of Falsehood. Yet,=\r\n the Supramental, he \n                maintained, carried a power of harmon=\r\nization which could \n                overcome this resistance by means othe=\r\nr than dramatic struggle \n                and violence. The Asuras will eve=\r\nntually be absorbed into their \n                original emanations of Ligh=\r\nt, Life, Beauty, and Truth. It may be \n                interesting to specu=\r\nlate, with all the violence in the world \n                today, the destru=\r\nction we might have experienced if not for this \n                power of h=\r\narmonization!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;U&gt;When does all this happen? =\r\nSri Aurobindo and the Mother \n                believed that the world stage=\r\n was set for this quantum descent, \n                and that it was quite i=\r\nmminent. The Mother said in 1968 that the \n                supramental tran=\r\nsformation was a certainty now, and that it \n                would come abo=\r\nut with a minimum of destruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough this \n                m=\r\ninimum is still considerable.=EF=BF=BD She said that the year 2000 \n       =\r\n         would be a turning point.&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;This was a very interesting read and matche=\r\ns what \n                Narasimhaji says about changes coming in the world.=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n                &lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  =\r\n              &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;\n                &lt;DIV class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;STR=\r\nONG&gt;&lt;SPAN \n                style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMI=\r\nLY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT \n                face=3DCourier color=3D#000000 size=3D3=\r\n&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#00007f&gt;The \n                upsurge (of consciousness) is B=\r\nhairava&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;- Shiva \n                Sutra&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\n/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;=\r\n/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_01DD_01C9F2CC.CDA591C0--\r\n\n"}}
