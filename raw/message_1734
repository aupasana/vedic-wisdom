I have done\nthis several times now over the past few weeks, early on Sun=\r\nday\nmornings.  The thing that concerns me is that there is an unmistakably\n=\r\nnegative effect on one member of my family, and that person has a very\nstro=\r\nng exalted, simhasanamsa, unafflicted, badhakesh Sun conjoining AK\nMercury.=\r\n  I see this (the correlation between my doing the homam and the\nnegative e=\r\nffect) over and over and over again, it doesnt seem to be my\nimagination. I=\r\n dont want to go too deep in the details.\n\nI know you cant analyze anything=\r\n based on such little detail, but\nclearly fire-based worship does seem to &quot;=\r\nplay up&quot; the agni-tattwa and\nrelated planets, no? Are there &quot;cooler&quot;, perha=\r\nps water-based forms of\nworship too? After these thoughts came to my head, =\r\nI saw that you have a\nPitri tarpana manual and it is water-based(!) as well=\r\n.. But I dont\nunderstand it well. Can you please explain a bit of the astro=\r\nlogy of\nthese worships - am I mistaken in noting this increase in agni-tatt=\r\nwa\nbased planets, and &quot;wanting&quot; &quot;cooler&quot; forms of worship? A long time ago,=\r\n\nI started listening to/chanting the Gayatri mantra, and I only saw\npositiv=\r\ne effects there (but there was no fire involved)..\n\nThank you very much in =\r\nadvance,\n\nSundeep\n\n\n\n"}}
