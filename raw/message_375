What you wrote is well-taken.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; That is why chastity and bram=\r\nacarya has always been\n&gt; &gt; considered the highest virtue. No YOga can happe=\r\nn without \nchastity.\n&gt;  \n&gt; That is absolutely correct. Brahmacharya and con=\r\ntrol of one&#39;s \nsexual thoughts is quite needed to make spiritual progress.\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; If anybody maintains brahmacharya for one year while performing a \n45=\r\n minute homam everyday or meditating with Gayatri mantra (or some \nother ma=\r\nntra) for 3 hours everyday, definitely he/she will cross \nsome important hu=\r\nrdles and make some good progress.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; It is clear why it is even more =\r\nimportant for women to be chaste \nand\n&gt; &gt; pious considering the strength of=\r\n Moon and Venus in her body-\ngross and\n&gt; &gt; causal.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Chastity and brahm=\r\nacharya are *equally important* for men and \nwomen to make spiritual progre=\r\nss. But the level of difficulty one \nexperiences in controlling the mind de=\r\npends on various factors such \nas gender and, more importantly, mental cond=\r\nitioning acquired from \nprevious lives.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; At least, Somannath drekana=\r\n should be checked for the period of \npoojas\n&gt; &gt; to see how the dasas suppo=\r\nrt celibacy vow that is usually \nrequired in\n&gt; &gt; the cases of sadhanas whos=\r\ne aim is spiritual elevation. \n&gt;  \n&gt; Well, two relevant points:\n&gt;  \n&gt; (1) T=\r\nhe astrology we know and understand is imperfect without a \ndoubt. Even kno=\r\nwledge taught unambiguously by Maharshi Parasara is \nso misunderstood in th=\r\nis age. Then what to speak of knowledge not \nfound in the available teachin=\r\ngs of Parasara and available in \nthe &quot;secrets&quot; of various paramparas? It is=\r\n quite prone to \ncorruptions and misunderstanding. Can we *rely* on it?\n&gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; (2) Astrology, even when understood perfectly, only predicts the \npredis=\r\nposition at a given time due to the dynamics of *previous* \nactions (karmas=\r\n). The dynamics of previous actions decides under \nwhat kind of circumstanc=\r\nes one has to operate now. Those \ncircumstances can place *limitations* on =\r\nwhat actions can be \nperformed *now*. Depending on the seriousness of previ=\r\nous actions \ndeciding the current circumstances, the limitations can be eit=\r\nher \nmere challenges or serious handicaps. But, in most cases, there are \nm=\r\nultiple actions possible currently. Horoscope only decides the \nsituations =\r\nfaced now. The actions performed *now* are based on *free \nwill* exerted no=\r\nw, which is NOT captured by the horoscope.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If there is one good thing=\r\n to use free will for, spiritual \nprogress is definitely *the* thing. One s=\r\nhould push one&#39;s free will \nto the extreme when it comes to spiritual progr=\r\ness. It is worth it! \nForget somanatha drekkana and other tenets of astrolo=\r\ngy. When the \ninspiration comes from within, just boldly take a vow, pray t=\r\no god \nand your guru (if you have no guru, think of me or my Guru Dr Manish=\r\n \nPandit) and do your best to keep the vow.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n Even if one cannot keep brahmacharya, one can still do spiritual \npractice=\r\ns like homam and japam. It will atleast keep one floating \n(i.e. not sinkin=\r\ng). Basically, one will keep accumulating shakti \n(purity) and keep consumi=\r\nng it. So purification is slow. But atleast \nthere is no further impurifica=\r\ntion. With brahmacharya, one can \nactually start accumulating shakti and pu=\r\nrify oneself much faster.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Regarding women d=\r\noing sadhanas:\n&gt;  \n&gt; A great Vedic scholar known as Upasani maharaj lived a=\r\nt the time \nof Shirdi Sai Baba, about 100 years back. He was learned in sev=\r\neral \nVedas and Upanishads and did tremendous sadhana. Once he realized \nSe=\r\nlf, he threw away his orthodoxy and went against the customs of \nthe time b=\r\noldly. He went and lived in Harijanwada (untouchables \ncolony), swept the f=\r\nloors there and forced the Brahmins from \nBrahmanawada (Brahmins colony) wh=\r\no revered him highly to come \n*there* if they wanted to see him! He opened =\r\na Vedic school for \nwomen and taught them chanting Vedic mantras and perfor=\r\nming \ntraditional yajnas. He gave women of all births sacred thread and \nin=\r\nitiated them into vedic mantras and yajnas.\n&gt;  \n&gt; When Shridi Sai Baba saw =\r\nhim oneday, he said &quot;Upasani is God \nHimself. Today we will do pooja to Upa=\r\nsani!&quot; and made his disciples \ndo a pooja to Upasani maharaj.\n&gt;  \n&gt; A templ=\r\ne run by women stands in the place of Upasani maharaj, a \nfew miles away fr=\r\nom Shirdi. If anyone goes to Shirdi, it is a good \nidea to go to that templ=\r\ne. Though it has no rush, it has very nice \nenergy. It is a great place to =\r\nmeditate.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Also, Krishna temple at Alandi near Pune where Sant Jnanesh=\r\nwar \nMaharaj went into underground samadhi 700 years back (believed to be \n=\r\nthere even now) has a tremendous level of spiritual energy. It is \nalso a g=\r\nreat place for productive meditation.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Shor=\r\nt Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas =\r\nYourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://gro=\r\nups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedic=\r\nastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicA=\r\nstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath=\r\n.org\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; --- In sohamsa@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tijana Damjanovic&quot; \n&lt;tijanadamjanovi=\r\nc@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; om krishna guru\n&gt; &gt; Dear Ana and other members of the th=\r\nread,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Difference exists and it makes the world go round, which is =\r\n\nperfectly\n&gt; &gt; fine. After it is understood properly, no pots and pans will=\r\n be \nneeded\n&gt; &gt; to define anyones role or place under the sun...that shines=\r\n the \nsame\n&gt; &gt; to one and all. :)\n&gt; &gt; Shrimad Devi Bhagavatam (one of the U=\r\npapuranas) states that \nsexual\n&gt; &gt; urge is much stronger in the case of wom=\r\nen. This is not \nsurprising as\n&gt; &gt; sexual urge is produced and governed by =\r\nthe liquid fluctuation \nin the\n&gt; &gt; body (watter, blood, semen and hormones =\r\nin the first place). This\n&gt; &gt; fluctuation is much higher in woman`s body du=\r\ne to the \npredominance of\n&gt; &gt; jala tatva in her body governed by planets Mo=\r\non and Venus. These \ntwo\n&gt; &gt; planets are also responsible for the producing=\r\n of the ojas (the\n&gt; &gt; finniest energetic product of our body that makes the=\r\n brain \nfunction\n&gt; &gt; properly, it is often understood as a vigor, vitality =\r\nand \nprocreative\n&gt; &gt; power). In general, this means that women can produce =\r\nmore ojas \nthan man.\n&gt; &gt; How is this related to poojas and spirituality?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Sexual energy, or sexual thoughts, are being transformed into \nojas in\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; the process of yoga. The process of yoga as one of its aim has \nlifting\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; of the ojas from its storage in the primal chakra and its \nstoring in\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; the brain. The more ojas in the brain the prettier, smarter and \nmore\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n spiritual we are. But this lifting of the ojas can be done ONLY \nby\n&gt; &gt; ch=\r\naste ones. That is why chastity and bramacarya has always been\n&gt; &gt; consider=\r\ned the highest virtue. No YOga can happen without \nchastity. It\n&gt; &gt; is clea=\r\nr why it is even more important for women to be chaste and\n&gt; &gt; pious consid=\r\nering the strength of Moon and Venus in her body-\ngross and\n&gt; &gt; causal.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Without chastity, yogic pratice can lead into a mental disorder \nas\n&gt; &gt; oj=\r\nas and prana directly influence the work of the brain centres. \nThus\n&gt; &gt; it=\r\n is crucial how demanding and serious the homam or pooja in\n&gt; &gt; question, o=\r\nr any other, is. Prohibition during the monthly cycle \nis\n&gt; &gt; based upon th=\r\nis also-increasing of the jala tatva and the sexual \nurge.\n&gt; &gt; At least, So=\r\nmannath drekana should be checked for the period of \npoojas\n&gt; &gt; to see how =\r\nthe dasas support celibacy vow that is usually \nrequired in\n&gt; &gt; the cases o=\r\nf sadhanas whose aim is spiritual elevation. \n&gt; &gt; The approaches to the fin=\r\nal truth may be numerous and different, \nbut\n&gt; &gt; all of them must find thei=\r\nr path through the Sushumna. The one \nwho\n&gt; &gt; claims that this path is hidd=\r\nen or blocked to women simply lacks \nojas\n&gt; &gt; in his/her brain.\n&gt; &gt; Regards=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; Tijana Damjanovic\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; P.S.
