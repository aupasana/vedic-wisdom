P=\r\nlease feel free to use whatever dhyana shloka your guru recommends to you o=\r\nr you feel attracted to. I will just make a generic philosophical comment. =\r\nIf it makes no sense, please ignore my 2 cents.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Dhyana shloka means a verse used for c=\r\nontemplating a deity. You use it to create a visualization in the mind, so =\r\nthat you visualize that form as you meditate later.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; One person I kn=\r\now wanted to worship a specific deity. He was so attracted to a specific pi=\r\ncture of that deity and felt much love. He wanted to worship that deity. He=\r\n found a mantra and a few dhyana shlokas. He asked me which dhyana shlokas =\r\nwill be better. I saw that none of them described the form in the specific =\r\npicture he was so attracted to. So I told him it does not matter and pick w=\r\nhatever you want.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; If one is able to pick a dhyana shloka that descr=\r\nibes a form one is able to mentally visualize well, that is useful. Otherwi=\r\nse, if one mechanically reads a specific Sanskrit verse and imagines someth=\r\ning else mentally, it is simply a broken practice or a formality. If one th=\r\nrows out the dhyana shloka and simply describes the form of interest in Eng=\r\nlish or Hindi mentally, constructs that form on mind and moves on, it may b=\r\ne as effective!\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; =\r\n=A0\n&gt; Some people are so concerned about picking a saattwik, raajasik or ta=\r\namasik dhyana shloka based on their perception of their guna.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Suppo=\r\nse a taamasik person imagines a supposedly saattwik form that is described =\r\nas a pleasant and fair lady in white clothes radianting bright light. He ma=\r\ny be thinking in the mind &quot;it is easy to get what I want from Her. She is n=\r\nice and gentle and will not give me any troubles. She stands for prospertit=\r\ny and will make me prosperous&quot; etc. Basically, he wants things from Her and=\r\n thoughts in his mind are of a taamasik nature, though the form being imagi=\r\nned is supposed to be of saattwik symbols.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Now, suppose a saattwik =\r\nperson imagines a supposedly taamasik form that is described as a fierce na=\r\nked black lady jumping around uncontrollably and making loud sounds. He may=\r\n be thinking in the mind &quot;ah, She represents the primordial energy at the e=\r\narly stages of creation. This raw energy is mysterious, unconditioned and u=\r\nncontrollable. Let me marvel at how this elaborate Creation comes from that=\r\n raw energy&quot;. Basically, thoughts in his mind are of a saattwik nature, tho=\r\nugh the form being imagined is supposed to be of taamasik symbols.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; =\r\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; The conditioning in=\r\n the mind - one&#39;s wants, likes and dislikes - determine whether one is saat=\r\ntwik (in a steady state of purity and clarity), raajasik (in an unsteady st=\r\nate of flux and change), taamasik (in a steady state of impurity and confus=\r\nion).\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; A very unruly kid can anger even a gentle mother. A sweet, ni=\r\nce and calm kid can make even a very fierce and agressive mother smile (ima=\r\ngine a fierce mother yelling loud at a baby and baby thinking it is funny a=\r\nnd laughing. Won&#39;t the mother mother laugh too?).\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Though using a fo=\r\nrm compatible with one&#39;s guna may be useful, people are not good at estimat=\r\ning their guna correctly. So, even if they worship a sattwik form, they end=\r\n up superimposing their rajas and tamas on that deity and on their sadhana.=\r\n So, the sadhana ends up being rajasik or saattwik, even though the deity a=\r\nnd sadhana may be made up of saattwik symbols.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Bottomline: What determines the guna o=\r\nf your sadhana is your state of mind rather than the deity used and the sym=\r\nbols used in sadhana.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrol=\r\nogy & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org \n&gt; --------\n&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
