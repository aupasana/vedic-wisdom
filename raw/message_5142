That is definitely the ideal s=\r\nituation.\n \nIf that is not possible, what I am saying is that reading somet=\r\nhing composed by an elevated being even without understanding the meaning i=\r\ns very useful. Suppose someone does not understand what Ganapathi Atharvase=\r\nersham means, thinks in general that it extols Ganapathi as the source of e=\r\nverything and chants it with a sense of surrender to Ganapathi. One can sti=\r\nll benefit immensely. If one is not experiencing anything, it is more likel=\r\ny because one does not have the correct attitude and surrender and probably=\r\n not because one does know the specific meaning of Ganapathi Atharvaseersha=\r\nm. Many people knowing the meaning and chanting may also experience nothing=\r\n.\n \nThe words uttered by a realized soul have meanings at many layers and l=\r\niteral meaning is only one superficial layer. Some important layers are los=\r\nt in translation. The most important layers of meaning are never understood=\r\n intellectually, but only experienced internally.\n \nWhether you know the me=\r\naning or not, chant the mantra with a calm and relaxed mind and with devoti=\r\non and surrender. Many people keep a target count and race through it or do=\r\n it mechanically with a sense of duty. If it is done even with a little bit=\r\n of love and surrender to the deity, it can do something. The key to succes=\r\ns with a mantra is calmness of the mind. If a mind is filled with thousands=\r\n of thoughts and chanting of the mantra is just one of those thousand activ=\r\nities, nothing will happen. If most thoughts subside and mind is essentiall=\r\ny reverberating with a mantra, that is when one experiences a mantra.\n \nThe=\r\nre are 4 levels of sabda. When one says a mantra, physical vibration is acc=\r\nompanied in other layers by the imagery in the mind, the thoughts and insti=\r\nncts in the conscious and sub-conscious mind etc. Some mantras composed by =\r\n(or revealed to) great rishis/yogis (essentially beings with very stable an=\r\nd calm minds) are designed such that the physical vibration of the mantra c=\r\nan eventually cause the corresponding imagery in the mind by resonance, whe=\r\nn other mental activity subsides. Thus, after repeating the mantra and calm=\r\ning the mind down, you can recreate a certain imagery and thought system in=\r\n your mind. That can permanently alter the way your mind workd. But the key=\r\n is to attain a reasonably stable, focused and calm mind.\n \nSant Dnyaneshwa=\r\nr&#39;s Marathi interpretation of BhagavadGita and Sant Tulsidas&#39;s Hindi compos=\r\nitions have a power of their own, as they were realized souls. In compariso=\r\nn, for examplle, Satyadevaashtakam composed by me, though in metrical Sansk=\r\nrit, will not have a similar power.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Softw=\r\nare, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manual=\r\ns for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n   =\r\n  Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n----------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------\n \n---- Girish Shahapurk=\r\nar &lt;geniusgirish@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear Sir,\n&gt; Would it not be of imme=\r\nnse help to the ordinary person whose knowledge of Sanskrit is limited not =\r\nonly to &quot;understand&quot; what he says but also take more interest, enjoyment, a=\r\nnd truly get immersed in what he is reciting/ reading?\n&gt; I think this is th=\r\ne reason for the great saints like Sant Dnyaneshwar to compose the Bhaavart=\r\nh Deepika in Marathi.\n&gt; But I agree with you that the sacred stotras should=\r\n be recited in sanskrit... \n&gt; Humbly,\n&gt; Girish Shahapurkar\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Tue,=\r\n 26/10/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: Narasimha =\r\nPVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Translations, Initiatio=\r\nn, Vedic vs Tantrik\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, 26 =\r\nOctober, 2010, 2:53 AM\n&gt;       \n&gt;       Namaste friends,\n&gt; \n&gt; I will give m=\r\ny 2 cents on a few points.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; I once wanted to t=\r\nranslate Devi Saptashati into my mother tongue Telugu in poetic form, so th=\r\nat Telugu people who find Saptashati too complicated to read or feel uncomf=\r\nortable because they do not know the meaning, can read the Telugu version i=\r\nnstead. When I floated the idea, Manish discouraged me. He asked me, &quot;who d=\r\no you think you are?&quot; He said that it could be considered later, but firmly=\r\n told me to drop the idea for then.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Please note that the goal o=\r\nf sadhana, such as homam, meditation, chanting mantras and prayers, is NOT =\r\njust an intellectual understanding of what they mean. They are tools to sil=\r\nence the mind and channel its energy. They are storehouses of some shakti l=\r\neft by rishis, yogis and sadhakas, who used them in the past.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; A=\r\nn intellectual understanding may help facilitate the right mood, right fram=\r\ne of mind and right imagery. But, even without it, a mantra that was used b=\r\ny great sadhakas, yogis and rishis holds power.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, the wo=\r\nrds of a rishi that one cannot intellectually understand can be more effect=\r\nive for spiritual progress, than the words of a normal person that one can =\r\nintellectually understand and appreciate. So, I suggest not worrying about =\r\nwhether one understands or not and reading Sanskrit mantras coming from gre=\r\nat rishis/yogis/sadhakas.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; If I =\r\nwere to give an analogy in terms of playing cricket, a batsman may read a l=\r\not of scholarly analysis on how to play shots, how to see the ball from the=\r\n hand of the bowler, how to move feet, how get into the line of the ball, h=\r\now to play it with a straight bat, when to play front foot and when to play=\r\n back foot etc. But that does not necessarily make one a good batsman. If o=\r\nne practices, THAT can make one a good player. Of course, some basic unders=\r\ntanding of principles is needed. But, above that, practice is more importan=\r\nt than bookish knowledge.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, some conceptual understand=\r\ning is important in spirituality also, but above that, sadhana is more impo=\r\nrtant.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; The essence of all scriptures, all mantras, all sadhanas=\r\n, all paths is very simple. It is that we should overcome the notions that =\r\nwe are doing things and realize that the divine acts through all of us. The=\r\n divine acts through each being based on one&#39;s conditioning and gives corre=\r\nsponding reactions. One goes through the cycle until one overcomes the noti=\r\nons of &quot;I am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot;, &quot;I like this and I dislike that&quot; etc. =\r\nThough this is the essence of all scriptures and one knows it, one may be d=\r\neluded again and again. There is no magic formula to internalize this under=\r\nstanding fully and overcome the instincts of &quot;I am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot; e=\r\ntc.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; So, even if one practices a mantra that one does not intell=\r\nectually understand, that is ok. As long as the basic essence of scriptures=\r\n is at the back of one&#39;s mind, one is constantly contemplating and watching=\r\n over one&#39;s own thoughts and instincts, to root out undesirable thoughts, o=\r\nne&#39;s sadhana will yield results.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; This is why I keep repeating the need of sadhana. It is fine to read scri=\r\nptures and other books. It is fine to meet spiritual people (physically or =\r\nvirtually, like here) and discuss good things. But that will only create a =\r\ntheoretical understanding. For it to be internalized and to govern all of o=\r\nne&#39;s instincts, thoughts and actions, one needs to do sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nOne doing sadhana without a basic theoretical understanding of what is what=\r\n and what we want, is like a blind person running around a mountain, instea=\r\nd of climbing it. One not doing sadhana, but having an excellent theoretica=\r\nl understanfing, is like a person who knows that he needs to climb the moun=\r\ntain, but keeps staring at the pinnacle instead of climbing it.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding the statement that initiation is=\r\n important in tantric path but not in Vedic path, I want to add my 2 cents.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Whether Vedic and tantrik paths are two *distinct* paths or pa=\r\nrts of a continuum is debatable. There are a lot of inaccurate notions toda=\r\ny.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; The issue is not really Tantrik vs Vedic. The issue is one&#39;s=\r\n attitude and what one wants. Anybody who wants specific material results n=\r\needs to be careful regarding how to go about it. Re-arrangement of karmas t=\r\no affect a particular result is not easy. It requires supervision of a good=\r\n guru and not many are left anyway. On the other hand, if one is NOT lookin=\r\ng for specific material results and is looking for spiritual progress, the =\r\nconstraints are fewer and options more.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Some may sub-consciousl=\r\ny have a notion that Tantrik path is for begetting specific material result=\r\ns and Vedic path is for self-realization. That is incorrect. After all, one=\r\n in the Vedic path may chant Manyu sooktam for victory in litigation or Ayu=\r\nshya sooktam for longevity, and so on. Similarly, one in the Tantrik path m=\r\nay eat a gross substance in an elaborate ritual to reinforce the notion tha=\r\nt &quot;all is Brahman&quot; and to remove the mental repulsion towards some objects.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; My thumbrule is this. If you a=\r\nre looking for a specific material result, you need clear guidance and supe=\r\nrvision, which not many are capable of giving today! Instead, if you want s=\r\npiritual progress and an increase of your surrender, you can just keep doin=\r\ng sadhana without initiation or guidance. Just keep company of scriptures a=\r\nnd other like-minded people.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; After all, if you want to go to Ca=\r\nlcutta, you need clear and precise directions and some supervision. If you =\r\njust want to go to north pole, you can keep walking towards north. Of cours=\r\ne, having supervision helps there too, but you can do without it!\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; \n&gt; --------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------\n&gt; \n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jy=\r\notish Writings,\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pi=\r\ntri Tarpana:\n&gt; \n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; \n&gt;    =\r\n  Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; \n&gt;      Spiritu=\r\nality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; \n&gt; --------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; ---- vedic_pathak &lt;vedic=\r\n_pathak@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Satya Prakash Ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; The reason I advised the non-initiate to read in English or any &gt;other re=\r\ngional language is because understanding the meaning and &gt;constant reflecti=\r\non are possible only when one repeatedly reads the &gt;text in a language that=\r\n they can fully follow.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes Sir, if this is the reason then =\r\nits understandable.

Since the last 4-5 years I hav=\r\ne preferred to stay away from internet forums due to various reasons. It ha=\r\ns been nearly a year since I interacted on an internet forum. However after=\r\n Narasimha garu forwarded a copy of the original post with my write up to m=\r\ny inbox, I visited this forum and quickly browsed through some posts. I am =\r\nhappy to note that the general atmosphere here is far better and more since=\r\nre than a lot of other forums. Having quickly browsed through this particul=\r\nar thread, I thought that I might reply to Utpal ji&#39;s question.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal ji has raised an important question regarding the necessi=\r\nty of initiation. I will address it after summarizing the big picture that =\r\nneeds to be invoked in order to understand the ONE question and the MANY an=\r\nswers possible. Firstly is the question a general or specific one? Generall=\r\ny speaking if the question is whether initiation is an absolute requirement=\r\n for spiritual life or sadhana, *my* answer is- NO. However if the question=\r\n is about the necessity of being initiated for mantra sadhana as enjoined b=\r\ny *Tantra marga*, the answer is =C3=82?YES.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;Munde m=\r\nunde matir bhinna&#39; as the tantric adage goes; thereby the necessity for mul=\r\ntiple approaches and multiple paths. Thus arises the inevitability of multi=\r\nple perspectives. In the pan-Indian context there are many paths for sadhan=\r\na. But in the current context of this question I will restrict myself to on=\r\nly the five that are relevant to the discussion.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a. =\r\nGnana marga (Advaitic/Vedantic)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; b. Yoga marga (Psycho-spiritual)=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; c. Mantra marga (Tantric)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; d. Bhakti marga (Love/Devo=\r\ntion)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; e. Karma marga (Action- Ritual path and/or Selfless Action=\r\ns)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritual life is nothing but the practicalisatio=\r\nn of the great abstract Truths of the Cosmos. Each of the above paths EMPHA=\r\nSISES particular methods and techniques in its attempt to practicalise the =\r\nabstract truths at an experiential level. Let us briefly look at the predom=\r\ninant methods/ techniques employed by each of these paths.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For t=\r\nhose who are predominantly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking eve=\r\nn the external guru is not necessary, though one can greatly benefit from t=\r\nhe wisdom and experience of a genuine teacher. The direct path of Advaita e=\r\nmphasises the methods of Viveka (Discernment) and Vichara (self-reflection)=\r\n. Advaita being essentially a culmination of the Vaidik system it has retai=\r\nned the vaidik practice of &#39;Swadhyaya&#39; (regular self-study of texts) too as=\r\n an important practice. All of these practices involve the &#39;self&#39; in a big =\r\nway with a marginal role for external practices.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yog=\r\na marga emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching by consistent practice) and Vaira=\r\ngya (Non-reactivity or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of Yoga additionally =\r\nemphasise &#39;Iswarapranidhana&#39; (orienting oneself towards the Supreme Iswara)=\r\n too while Bauddha and Jina schools of Yogamarga emphasise only the first t=\r\nwo as they subscribe to nirishwaravada.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhakti marga=\r\n (Love/Devotion) emphasises unconditional acceptance of Iswara&#39;s will throu=\r\ngh total surrender to the Supreme. On the contrary the emphasis in Karma ma=\r\nrga is on Action as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita. Engaging in actions wit=\r\nhout attachment to the results is the mainstay of Karma marga of the Gita.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally I will address the Tantric path of mantra sa=\r\ndhana where alone the inevitable necessity of initiation and thereby the ne=\r\ncessity of a Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the practicalization of c=\r\nertain occult truths via the energetics of Sabda through the employment of =\r\nVak. It presupposes certain dangers inherent to any lab experiment and ther=\r\neby certain regulations and safe practices. It should be remembered that ex=\r\ncept Bhakti marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at various levels, while B=\r\nhakti predominantly invokes Soma (the reference here is to the age-old `Agn=\r\ni-Someeyam&#39;). Among the paths that invoke Agni, one path invokes/employs th=\r\ne fire of the intellect, another the fire of speech, another the fire of au=\r\nsterity, and yet another the physical fire of the Yagnya and so on.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tantra&#39;s method of invoking fire deals with the fire of Vak=\r\n through the lab-like practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra employs highly p=\r\nowerful techniques that bring results more quickly it lays great emphasis o=\r\nn adhikara. Adhikara is not about authority but more about qualification. W=\r\nould you allow a child to experiment with fire without any supervision? Doe=\r\ns the supervisor need experience and training or not? Like any other lab ex=\r\nperiment proper training and experience are part of the procedure apart fro=\r\nm certain safety measures, in the Tantric lab experiment too.  However the =\r\nlab is one&#39;s own consciousness whilst the experiment is awakening the Sakti=\r\n within the individual consciousness (also referred to as Kundalini Sakti).=\r\n As this is not a topic for mere intellectualisation, I will refrain from f=\r\nurther discussion on the Kundalini. Without going into other needless detai=\r\nls here, I will just elaborate on initiation and Guru parampara.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to contextu=\r\nalise it within the larger Tantric context too. Sakti sadhana is one major =\r\nriver within the Tantric context. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sa=\r\nkta sadhanas comprehensively. However there are actually three major school=\r\ns that are full-fledged living traditions among the DashaMahaVidyas- Kaliku=\r\nla, Srikula and Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kalikula whilst=\r\n Sri Vidya  sadhana belongs to Srikula. Just to make the picture more compl=\r\nete the Vajrayanas among the Buddhists (!) have taken to Tarakula. To those=\r\n who are familiar with Tibetan Buddhism I will draw attention to the the 21=\r\n forms of Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana shares both the Advaitic outlook as well=\r\n as the Sakta sadhanas in its approach to sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; K=\r\nali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma is not invoked at all)=\r\n while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, at least at the major milestone=\r\ns in the internal spiritual journey. The yantra, mantra, bija, devata, etc =\r\nare all consistently of a particular set of synchronistic frequencies for e=\r\nach of these three lineages. Initiation is the full-fledged entry of the pr=\r\nactitioner into a particular spiritual lineage of that path (kula). The Gur=\r\nu parampara can be compared to an INVERTED TREE with SIVA himself at the ro=\r\not from where the trunk arises. Each branch and sub-branches and twigs spre=\r\nad out progressively downward till the individual sadhaka.  It is a beautif=\r\nul metaphor if you can visualise it. Another modern metaphor that one can u=\r\nse is that of electricity. It is held by the Tantric advocate that initiati=\r\non not only completes the circuit necessary for the conduit of electricity =\r\nbut also prevents short circuit. Imagine many beautiful\n&gt;  bulbs/lights at =\r\neach point in this inverted tree of live wires, where there is a long serie=\r\ns of sadhakas sitting in silent practice all the way up till Siva himself. =\r\n It is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) and Sound (Sabda). Now back to Sr=\r\ni Sri Chandi.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As already stated Sakta sadhana seeks =\r\nto awaken Sakti within the individual consciousness through an integrated a=\r\npproach that combines the practices of Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and Mantr=\r\na. Both Kalikula and Srikula have evolved into highly comprehensive and int=\r\negrated approaches that can simultaneously hold the many in the One. Sri Sr=\r\ni Chandi seemingly starts with the Pauranic approach. However it is also a =\r\nfull-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads. It is also simulta=\r\nneously a text on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. The question of initi=\r\nation is relevant only to those following the Tantramarga and thus employin=\r\ng the text as a mantramaya text . For those who explore the text as a yogas=\r\nastra, the esoteric meaning is more relevant which I have covered extensive=\r\nly in my write-up. For those who are already inclined to the Advaitic path,=\r\n Sri Sri Chandi provides the context for immensely powerful reflections thr=\r\nough its central message\n&gt;  of Oneness. The crest jewel, the crowning glory=\r\n in the text is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself proclaims in full-fl=\r\nedged Upanishadic fashion that She is one without a second, saying &quot;I alone=\r\n exist in this universe. Who else is there besides me?&quot; (10.5). Compare it =\r\nwith the other Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflect on the central trut=\r\nh of Advaita.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reason I advised the non-initiate =\r\nto read in English or any other regional language is because understanding =\r\nthe meaning and constant reflection are possible only when one repeatedly r=\r\neads the text  in a language that they can fully follow. The main idea of t=\r\nhe writeup is to explore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic text too apart f=\r\nrom its obvious status as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri Chandi is also equal=\r\nly regarded as Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especially the four hymns. I=\r\nn that regard all the applications of Veda mantras or the Veda Samhita are =\r\nequally possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the practice of Chandi *HOMA=\r\nM*. Anyone who is acquainted with the original Vedic method will straightaw=\r\nay identify that Yagnya is the central Vedic practice. In fact even the wor=\r\nship of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully based on and DERIVED from =\r\na one on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with the Hindu temple.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just as some practitioners do the Homam as an integral part o=\r\nf Sri Sri Chandi sadhana in accordance with the Vedic approach, there are t=\r\nhose who adhere to the Tantric approach and do the sadhana as per the mantr=\r\na marga. It is this particular approach that needs initiation as per its ow=\r\nn principles. Initiation is not mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path o=\r\nf Viveka and Vichara, or the Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even th=\r\ne Pauranic approach of reading the text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise H=\r\nomam too is not required if one is not inclined to the predominantly Vaidik=\r\n practice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may benefit from any or all of these approa=\r\nches to Sri Sri Chandi. However one has to bear in mind that the living and=\r\n breathing traditions of both Kalikula as well as Srikula as practiced orig=\r\ninally in various parts of the subcontinent originally trace themselves to =\r\nTantra marga and hence the importance of initiation for those paths, be it\n=\r\n&gt;  Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In summary, one can =\r\nmake spiritual progress through any of the merthods/practices using Sri Sri=\r\n Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara, Iswarapranidhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, N=\r\nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa etc are all effective. However depending o=\r\nn the individual temperament, aptitude etc., some of these methods are more=\r\n suited relatively to different practitioners. One may progress through a c=\r\nombination of any of these methods in spiritual life. However the *full-fle=\r\ndged* integrated approach of KALIKULA involves Mantra diksha too. It is thi=\r\ns big picture against which the answer to the question has to be contextual=\r\nised.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally one last word. Irrespective of the met=\r\nhod and path, SWADHYAYA and SATSANGHA are the most effective methods for al=\r\nl of us. Swadhyaya is regular self-study of texts followed by reflection on=\r\n the truths expounded in the texts. This is best done in a language that on=\r\ne is fully conversant with. As for SATSANGHA it is the FIRST AND BEST choic=\r\ne among all methods. Swadhyaya is the alternate method (though not as power=\r\nful) where Satsangha is not possible. It is Satsangha and satsangha alone t=\r\nhat enables one to make rapid progress in spiritual life. Sri Ramakrishna a=\r\nttained the rare exalted state by virtue of serving, listening to and spend=\r\ning time in the company of sadhus and sants in his younger days. Vivekanand=\r\na , Jnanadeva  and  Gorakhnath  made a quantum leap in their spiritual live=\r\ns after they attended the Satsangha of Ramakrishna, Nivrittinath and Matsye=\r\nndranath respectively.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For those who complain about =\r\nthe scarcity of Satsangha nowadays, I will just quote Swami Sivananda:\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; QUOTE  // &quot;There is a complaint by householders nowadays that there =\r\nare no good Mahatmas. This is a lame excuse. The company of Sadhus is a que=\r\nstion of supply and demand. If there is a sincere demand, the supply will c=\r\nome at once. This is the inexorable law of nature. If you are really thirst=\r\ny, you will find your Master at your threshold. You lead a happy-go-lucky l=\r\nife, your mind is full of passion and unholy Vasanas. You do not care a bit=\r\n for higher divine life. You waste your time in idle gossiping and vain, wo=\r\nrldly talks. You have become a hopeless slave of passion, greed, and name a=\r\nnd fame. And yet you complain: `I cannot get good Satsanga.&#39;... Make yourse=\r\nlf a deserving Adhikari first. Then come to me. I shall take you to the lot=\r\nus-feet of blessed souls who will put you in the right path, guide you and =\r\nelevate you to sublime heights. These &quot;oversouls&quot; or high souls are waiting=\r\n to get hold of the right type of aspirants. Mahatmas are in plenty.\n&gt;  Rea=\r\nl seekers are few. If you bring a charge, &quot;There are no good Mahatmas.&quot; Mah=\r\natmas also bring a serious charge, &quot;There are no real seekers after Truth.&quot;=\r\n.&quot;  //UNQUOTE\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To a certain extent even this forum is=\r\n an opportunity for Satsangha. Conducted with the appropriate bhavana, this=\r\n group too is a potential Satsangha though not comparable to the actual com=\r\npany of the great masters. By swadhyaya of Sri Sri Chandi as a yoga-vedanti=\r\nc text alongside a study of the lives of great Saktas such as Sri Ramakrish=\r\nna Paramahamsa, by listening and/or singing the uplifting kirtans/chants la=\r\nuding the Mother, by constant remembrance and reflection, by discernment of=\r\n sat and asat, by genuine and sincere discussions on a group such as this, =\r\none makes progress truly.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I may not interact regular=\r\nly or reply at least for a while. However I might participate in some discu=\r\nssions on and off.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Satya Prakash=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot;=\r\n &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste everybody,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I read this message of respected Narasimha Garu few tim=\r\nes. Frankly, i found it routine because i found that i know all these alrea=\r\ndy as he has so many times mentioned these things  and then it suddenly occ=\r\noured to me that he has given answer to a very very crucial query which kee=\r\np on haunting many people and confuse people a lot. I am obviously talking =\r\nabout &quot;Initiation&quot; and he has really given an answer to this greatly confus=\r\ning phenomina. I am reproducing this again below. for me i am completely sa=\r\ntisfied with simple but very effective defination. i would draw attention o=\r\nf members to following paragraph again:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If you want to do Chandipath or any mantra or any ritual or any h=\r\nomam, do it with the attitude of &quot;I have several material desires, but I do=\r\n not know how to fulfil them. Because of this ritual, god may give any mate=\r\nrial results or spiritual results and not necessarily fulfil my desires. I =\r\nwill accept whatever god gives. I want to increase my devotion and surrende=\r\nr and make spiritual progress&quot;. You are then SAFE. Initiation is not requir=\r\ned. That attitude itself is an initiation!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ]\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So Its a time to say Happy Vijaya Dashami in true sense! I know he=\r\n&#39;ll not like my post but what can I do? I like him as i like Thakur and Sac=\r\nhin Tendulkar :)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste fri=\r\nends,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Happy Vijaya Dasami!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (1) I do not share Dr Choudhary&#39;s opinion about reading English=\r\n translation instead of Sanskrit verses if one is not initiated.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2) Initiation serves two purposes:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2a) As in the analogy I gave earlier, a rich father may open a =\r\nbank account in a son&#39;s name with a starting balance of one million dollars=\r\n. Similarly, a guru with some achievement in a mantra can transfer some of =\r\nit to a disciple. However, one without a rich father is still better off op=\r\nening a bank account with a zero balance and building it up slowly with one=\r\n&#39;s own hard work. Similarly, one not finding a guru can still do sadhana wi=\r\nth famous mantras and build one&#39;s own spiritual account. If you find a guru=\r\n to initiate you (not as a formality, but truly initiate you), get initiate=\r\nd. Otherwise, just go ahead and do it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2b) M=\r\nantras and rituals are used for two purposes - (i) for getting specific mat=\r\nerial results and (ii) as tools of increasing surrender and making spiritua=\r\nl progress. In the case of (ii), initiation is not that important. But, in =\r\nthe case of (i), there are pitfalls and a guru can prepare one sufficiently=\r\n. One can get in trouble otherwise.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, =\r\nas I said several times, there are very few people who can do (i) now-a-day=\r\ns. Nature has destabilized the whole system, for a reason, as Kali progress=\r\ned. I suggest doing mantras and rituals only for increasing surrender, gett=\r\ning whatever material results god wants to give and making spiritual progre=\r\nss. If one is meant to do rituals for begetting *specific* material results=\r\n (for oneself or others or society/universe in general), Nature will make a=\r\nrrangements for one to get correct knowledge of such rituals. But, as one s=\r\ntarts, one should start with the attitude of (ii).\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If you want to do Chandipath or any mantra or any ritual or any h=\r\nomam, do it  with the attitude of &quot;I have several material desires, but I d=\r\no not know how to fulfil them. Because of this ritual, god may give any mat=\r\nerial results or spiritual results and not necessarily fulfil my desires. I=\r\n will accept whatever god gives. I want to increase my devotion and surrend=\r\ner and make spiritual progress&quot;. You are then SAFE. Initiation is not requi=\r\nred. That attitude itself is an initiation!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (=\r\n4) Gentle deities give good results slowly, but there are fewer hiccups. Fi=\r\nerce deities give results fast, but there may be some hiccups. I gave this =\r\nanalogy earlier also. Imagine that a person is taking rotten fruits from a =\r\nfruit basket and throwing them in garbage and trying to retrieve one good f=\r\nruit from under them. If the person is gentle, one may do it gently and the=\r\n spillage of rotten fruits on the floor will be minimal. If the person is a=\r\nggressive, one may do it fast and there may be more spillage of rotten frui=\r\nts on the floor. But the good fruit stuck under the rotten fruits will be r=\r\netrieved faster. Similarly, phala of your karmas is in a basket. The deity =\r\nis trying to take bad fruits and throw them in garbage and give you a good =\r\nfruit to eat. There may be some spillage. A gentle deity like Ganapathi, Vi=\r\nshnu or Lakshmi may take more time to get out the good fruit, but the spill=\r\nage will be minimal. A fierce deity like Chandi or\n&gt;  Bhairava or Kali or N=\r\narasimha may have more spillage, but the good fruit comes out faster.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the end, remember that these fruits are not dei=\r\nty&#39;s creations, but fruits of your own actions. Without sadhana, you would&#39;=\r\nve had to eat each of those rotten fruits before eating the good fruits!\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nevertheless, one unable to take some of the sp=\r\nillage of rotten fruits is better off avoiding fierce deities such as Chand=\r\ni and staying with gentler deities. If initiation if made mandatory, one ca=\r\nn be assessed by a guru before starting a practice. If you realize the abov=\r\ne, you can start mantras without initiation. If some bad results occut, you=\r\n have to realize that it is a fruit of your own actions and the deity is tr=\r\nying to accelerate good results. If you are weak-hearted, stick to gentler =\r\ndeities.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (5) Some people who never lit a lamp=\r\n in their life and were ignorant of rituals, are doing daily homam now. Som=\r\ne people who took several hours to read Saptashati for the first time just =\r\n2-3 years back are now doing Chandi homam with entire saptashati everyday. =\r\nI know that some of them have transformed a lot and have experienced some t=\r\nhings too. Obviously, they have done sadhana with fire and sadhana of the F=\r\nierce aspects of Divine Mother in some past lives.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (6) In this age of ignorance and rank materialism, if someone has eve=\r\nn a faint idea that spiritual progress is important, is looking for god and=\r\n is attracted to a specific advanced sadhana (e.g. Chandipath), that person=\r\n obviously has some good karmas and good vasanas. That person has done that=\r\n sadhana in the past. Previous life&#39;s sadhana itself is one&#39;s adhikara.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (7) If you have a good understanding of what is =\r\nwhat, how things work, why one should do something, how to do it, what is m=\r\nore important and what is less important, that is what initiation is all ab=\r\nout!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n\n\n"}}
