One my find it an interest read.\n\nThe possibl=\r\ne extent of India in the past.\n\n&quot;The earth&#39;s landmass to the extent known t=\r\no Indians was quite extended and was known interchangeably as their own cou=\r\nntry or the world...\n\n\n1. Geography:\nThe political boundary of India was im=\r\nmaterial. The whole landmass known to Indians was known both as &quot;Bharata&quot; a=\r\nnd &quot;Vishwa&quot; interchangeably, as per the scriptures. This mythology is maint=\r\nained in history insofar as playwright Kalidasa&#39;s works are concerned. Ther=\r\ne are no movement restrictions imposed by the army of any king in the journ=\r\ney of Shakuntala or, much later, of Arjuna. Even mudraas (currency) are the=\r\n same everywhere they go. If not, they must be fully convertible at whateve=\r\nr exchange rates were prevalent at that time (I did not read about such con=\r\nvertibility though).\n\n=95 2. Moral science:\nWhen Krishna tells Arjuna, &quot;&#2=\r\n360;&#2381;&#2357;&#2343;&#2352;&#2381;&#2350;&#2375; &#2344;&#2367;&#2343;=\r\n&#2344;&#2350;&#2381; &#2358;&#2381;&#2352;&#2375;&#2351;&#2307; &#2346;&#2=\r\n352;&#2343;&#2352;&#2381;&#2350;&#2379; &#2349;&#2351;&#2366;&#2357;&#2361;=\r\n&#2307; (it&#39;s better to die doing one&#39;s own duty than attempt the job of so=\r\nmebody else, which is fraught with danger),&quot; does he mean non-Kshatriyas ar=\r\ne non-Hindus? No, clearly &quot;dharma&quot; means duty here -- in Arjuna&#39;s case, Ksh=\r\natriya-specific duty (that to fight the enemy) -- not religion.\n\n=95 3. Rel=\r\nigion:\nBack to Kalidasa, religion-wise, Gandhaara and Siam have been depict=\r\ned to have the same gods and goddesses as today&#39;s India. The corollary: the=\r\nre was no other religion to talk about. \n\n=95 4. Sociology:\nBefore casteist=\r\n Manu, the dos and don&#39;ts were not strictly defined. Yet certain things wer=\r\ne taboo and, by that definition, irreligious. Cannibalism, for example. I h=\r\nave mentioned Kaliya Yaman already. The Mahabharata says many people in his=\r\n kingdom were cannibals. Which means the Vedas couldn&#39;t possibly have been =\r\nfollowed in the region that is now known as the Middle East. However, you c=\r\nannot call the citizens of another country criminals because they do not fo=\r\nllow your country&#39;s laws. That means, the Vedic laws applied to the Middle =\r\nEast, but the people living in that region didn&#39;t give it a damn. Thus, tha=\r\nt region was a renegade province and not a foreign country.\n\n=95 5. Linguis=\r\ntics:\n(a) If you study Sanskrit grammar you will appreciate that it&#39;s far m=\r\nore detailed than Latin. The eight wibhaktis and several exceptions* in eac=\r\nh are somewhat paralleled only by seven such classifications in Arabic. You=\r\n may note that details in grammar diminish gradually as we move westward. A=\r\nrabic nominative, genitive and accusative are explicit and varied whereas a=\r\nblative, locative, dative and instrumental cases are only implied, not cate=\r\ngorised as such. Sambodhana (address) is not considered a case in Arabic. G=\r\nreek has less details and some flaws in categorisation of cases. Latin has =\r\nthe least details. \n\n(b) The dwiwachana (dual) number in between singular a=\r\nnd plural was prevalent in Ancient Greek (more similarities in Indo-Europea=\r\nn languages: http://www.friesian.com/cognates.htm). Arabic is Afro-Asiatic,=\r\n not Indo-European, but it has the dual number too. In Africa, some modern =\r\ndialects have the dual number, but in ancient times, there was no language =\r\ncontemporary as well as literary in Africa corresponding to Arabic in Asia.=\r\n And only advanced languages have the dual. So how come grammarians in the =\r\nstretch between India and Greece through Arabia made rules that were so sim=\r\nilar? And why did the details disappear or reduce drastically in Latin? Why=\r\n are roots less scientifically graded in Greek? No philologist has the answ=\r\ner. They only guesstimate Sanskrit, Greek and Latin may have had a common r=\r\noot**.\n\n* {a classic example of exceptions within the same wibhaktis in San=\r\nskrit: It&#39;s &#2309;&#2361;&#2306; &#2350;&#2350; &#2350;&#2367;&#2340;&#238=\r\n1;&#2352;&#2360;&#2381;&#2351; &#2327;&#2371;&#2361;&#2375; &#2327;&#2330;&=\r\n#2381;&#2331;&#2366;&#2350;&#2367; (I&#39;m going to my friend&#39;s place), but &#=\r\n2348;&#2369;&#2342;&#2381;&#2343;&#2350;&#2381; &#2358;&#2352;&#2339;&#2350=\r\n;&#2381; &#2327;&#2330;&#2381;&#2331;&#2366;&#2350;&#2367; (lit.: I&#39;m going=\r\n in the path/to the shelter of the Buddha; in proper English: I&#39;m seeking t=\r\nhe Buddha/embracing Buddhism) and not &#2348;&#2369;&#2342;&#2381;&#2343;&#=\r\n2360;&#2381;&#2351; &#2358;&#2352;&#2339;&#2375; &#2327;&#2330;&#2381;&#233=\r\n1;&#2366;&#2350;&#2367;! Note that &quot;of&quot; =96 `-sya&#39; in the first instance bu=\r\nt `-am&#39; in the second; &quot;to&quot; =96 `-e&#39; in the first but `-am&#39; in the second}\n=\r\n\nTherefore the four classical languages show similar thought processes. ** =\r\nThe &quot;common root&quot; of Sanskrit, Greek and Latin can be researched further fr=\r\nom the papers of Asiatic Society, Park Street, Kolkata. They do not claim A=\r\nrabic to have the same root. Neither do I. I am simply intrigued by the sim=\r\nilar studies of cases in Sanskrit and Arabic. \n\nAll the above together indi=\r\ncate that the then world as known to Indians behaved like a singular countr=\r\ny defined by a single culture, albeit the influence of India reduced as we =\r\nmoved westward.&quot;\n\n\n\n-Regards\n Rajarshi\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
