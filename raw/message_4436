Let me use a few verses to illustrate my poin=\r\nt.\n \n*        *        *\n \nLet us take the first 3 riks dedicated to Sarasw=\r\nati that appear in RV 1.3:\n \npAvakaAH naH sarasvatI vAjebhirvAjinIvatI| yaG=\r\nYaM vaShTu dhiyAvasuH|| RV 1.3.10\ncodayitrI sUnR^itAnAM cetantI sumatInAM| =\r\nyaGYaM dadhe sarasvatI|| RV 1.3.11\nmaho arNo sarasvatI pracetayati ketunA| =\r\ndhiyo vishvA virAjati|| RV 1.3.12\n \n*        *        *\n \nGriffith&#39;s transl=\r\nation is as follows:\n \n1.3.10 Wealthy in spoil, enriched with hymns, may br=\r\night Sarsavad desire,\nWith eager love, our sacrifice.\n1.3.11 Inciter of all=\r\n pleasant songs, inspirer o all gracious thought,\nSarasvati accept our rite=\r\n.\n1.3.12 Sarasvati, the mighty flood,- she with be light illuminates,\nShe b=\r\nrightens every pious thought.\n \nTo Hindus, Veda is absolute and supreme kno=\r\nwledge. Veda is considered to be the knowledge of the Imperishable Self. Un=\r\nfortunately, absurdly superficial, utterly nonsensical and absolutely usele=\r\nss translations such as the above reduce Veda to the level of idle and flow=\r\nery poetry about external rites and rituals. Any student who is genuinely i=\r\nnterested in Veda and the teachings of rishis should reject these superfici=\r\nal works and approach freshly.\n \nAs I said earlier, Aurobindo Ghose is an a=\r\nbsolutely brilliant intellectual as well as a great yogi/experiencer. His &quot;=\r\nSecret of the Veda&quot; is a very good starting point. Use Swami Dayananda Sara=\r\nswati&#39;s commentary as the springboard, use Aurobindo&#39;s work as the inspirat=\r\nion to jump up from the that springboard and keep doing spiritual sadhana w=\r\nhile you study Veda. THAT is possibly the only way to unlock the true meani=\r\nng and make some sense of Veda. Translation by Griffith is useless.\n \n*    =\r\n    *        *\n \nNow, let me give my independent translation, inspired by A=\r\nurobindo&#39;s work.\n \nSarasvati literally means &quot;the one who faicilitates the =\r\nflow&quot;. In Aurobindo&#39;s opinion, various deities and external symbols were us=\r\ned to symbolize various internal principles, *consistently* throughout RigV=\r\neda by various rishis. According to him, Saraswati symbolizes inspiration f=\r\nrom Truth.\n \nIn yogic traditions, Ganga and Yamuna rivers symbolize the Ida=\r\n (Chandra) and Pingala (Surya) nadis and the hidden Sarasvati river symboli=\r\nzes the hidden Sushumna nadi. When Kundalini shakti (power of self-awarenes=\r\ns) flows in Sushumna nadi, one starts to transcend falsified notions of sel=\r\nf (e.g. I am the body) and starts to realize one&#39;s true nature. Thus Sushum=\r\nna nadi or Saraswati is the facilitator of the flow of Truth, i.e. awarenes=\r\ns of True Self.\n \nMy independent translation:\n \n1.3.10: The subtle energy c=\r\nhannel that facilitates the flow of an awareness of True Self (sarasvatI), =\r\nby being the controller of the racing horses (vAjinIvatI) of false notions =\r\nof who we are and what Truth is (vAjebhiH) and thus purifies (pAvakAH) us (=\r\nnaH). By devotion and surrender to the Supreme (dhiyAvasuH), it illuminates=\r\n and invigorates (vaShTu) sacrifice of one&#39;s false notions about self (yaGY=\r\naM).\n \nWhen the power of self-awareness is awakened and flows in the Sushum=\r\nna nadi (Saraswati channel), various false notions of who we are (I am the =\r\nbody, this is mine etc) that are racing in our consciousness like horses ar=\r\ne controlled and we are purified (i.e. ridden of false notions that make us=\r\n impure). As we are purified, our devotion and surrender to the Supreme (ak=\r\na True Self) increases and invigorates the sense of sacrifice in us (i.e. g=\r\niving up false notions of being and doership).\n \nyaGYaM dadhe sarasvatI|| R=\r\nV 1.3.11\n\n1.3.11: The subtle energy channel that facilitates the flow of aw=\r\nareness of True Self (sarasvatI) impels (codayitrI) the bliss of Truth (sUn=\r\nR^itAnAM), awakens (cetantI) good thoughts based on Truth (sumatInAM) and s=\r\nupports (dadhe) sacrifice of false notions about self (yaGYaM).\n \nAs the ho=\r\nrses of false notions are controlled and one is purified (see 1.3.10), the =\r\nnext stage is described here. As the power of self-awareness flows further =\r\nin the Sushumna nadi (Saraswati channel), one experiences the bliss of Trut=\r\nh and good thoughts based in Truth. Thoughts based on false notions (e.g. I=\r\n am the body, this is mine) may bring happiness sometimes and sadness somet=\r\nimes, but they can never bring the bliss of Truth. As self-awareness flows =\r\nfurther in Sushumna nadi, one is established in good notions and bliss.\n \nd=\r\nhiyo vishvA virAjati||\n \n1.3.12: The subtle energy channel that facilitates=\r\n the flow of awareness of True Self (sarasvatI) illumines and awakens one t=\r\no (pracetayati) the great ocean of Cosmic Self (maho arNaH) with absolute c=\r\nlarity (ketunA) and also throws light on and establishes (virAjati) multipl=\r\nicity of consciousness (dhiyaH) and worlds (vishvAH).\n \nThis describes the =\r\nnext stage after what is described in 1.3.10 and 1.3.11. It describes what =\r\nhappens when the power of self-awareness rises the highest in Sushumna nadi=\r\n. One is awakened to the great ocean of Cosmic Self, i.e. one realizes true=\r\n Self. Also, this Cosmic Self establishes itself as various limited intelle=\r\ncts and objects and as various worlds that exist. One is aware of oneself a=\r\ns the undivided cosmic self and also as various beings and worlds. One sees=\r\n various beings and worlds in oneself. Such an awareness of Self with absol=\r\nute clarity results with the power of self-awareness flows totally uninterr=\r\nupted in the Sushumna/Saraswati channel.\n \n*        *        *\n \nNow, this =\r\nrendering is perfectly tenable. One can defend it quite comfortably with Sa=\r\nnskrit scholars, Vedic scholars, philosophers and yogis. It is a holistic r=\r\nendering, non-silly, quite deep and rich in inner meaning. Moreover, it thr=\r\nows light on overcoming false notions of Self and realizing true Self and t=\r\nhrows light on the stages of self-realization. Compare this with the superf=\r\nicial meaning given by Griffith!\n \n*        *        *\n \nRegarding Sayana&#39;s=\r\n commentary and Griffith&#39;s commentary, let me quote from Aurobindo:\n \n&quot;It i=\r\ns the final and authoritatice binding of the Veda to this lowest of all pos=\r\nsible senses that has been the most unfortunate result of Sayana&#39;s commenta=\r\nry. The dominance of the ritualistic interpretation had already deprived In=\r\ndia of the living use of its greatest Scripture and of the true clue to the=\r\n entire sense of the Upanishads. Sayana&#39;s commentary put a seal of finality=\r\n on the old misunderstanding which could not be broken for many centuries. =\r\nAnd its suggestions, when another civilisation discovered and set itself to=\r\n study the Veda, became in the European mind the parent of fresh errors.\n \n=\r\n&quot;Nevertheless, if Sayana&#39;s work has been a key turned with double lock on t=\r\nhe inner sense of the Veda, it is yet indispensable for opening the antecha=\r\nmbers of Vedic learning. All the vast labour of Europeans erudition has not=\r\n been able to replace its utility. At every step we are obliged to differ f=\r\nrom it, but at every step we are obliged to use it. It is a necessary sprin=\r\nging board, or a stair that we have to use for entrance, though we must lea=\r\nve it behind if we wish to pass forwards into the penetralia.&quot;\n \nI am amaze=\r\nd that people who rely on Griffith seem to think that they know what is in =\r\nVeda and what is not. Nobody can claim to fully understand what is in Veda,=\r\n let alone someone who relies on Griffith!\n \n*        *        *\n \nAs I sai=\r\nd earlier, Aurobindo Ghose is an absolutely brilliant intellectual as well =\r\nas a great yogi/experiencer. His &quot;Secret of the Veda&quot; is a very good starti=\r\nng point for a renaissance in understanding the true sense of Veda. We must=\r\n jettison commentaries such as Griffith&#39;s, if we were to make progress in u=\r\nnderstanding the true sense of Veda.\n \nAs I said, use Swami Dayananda Saras=\r\nwati&#39;s commentary as the springboard. Use Aurobindo&#39;s work as the inspirati=\r\non to jump up from the that springboard. Keep doing spiritual sadhana while=\r\n you study Veda (to get the &quot;energy&quot; to jump up). THAT is possibly the only=\r\n way to unlock the true meaning and make some sense of Veda.\n \nBest regards=\r\n,\nNarasimha\n---------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do I=\r\nt Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n             =\r\n     http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http=\r\n://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedi=\r\nc-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- =\r\nNarasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I have=\r\n been ignoring many taunts from Mr Kaul to Vedic astrologers over the last =\r\nfew years.

As such, Griffith cannot be acc=\r\nused of a biased meaning!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If the members so desire, I can scan a c=\r\nopy of the pages of the Rigveda  of\n&gt; &gt; the impugned mantrs with Sayana Bha=\r\nshya in Sanskrit.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I also wonder if any of the members of this foru=\r\nm ever recites the famous\n&gt; &gt; shanti-paath\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Oom sham no mitrah sham=\r\n varunah sham no bhavatu-aryama\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sham na indro brhaspatih sham no v=\r\nishnuru urukramah=E2=80=A6\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Or\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Svasti na indro vridha shra=\r\nvaah svasti nah poosha vishva vedah\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Swasti nas taarkshyo arishtane=\r\nmih svasti no brihaspatir dadhatu\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Oom shantih shaantih shaantih\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I must also put on record that Brihaspati has been talked about in e=\r\nvery\n&gt; &gt; Veda, whether the Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda or Atharva-Veda lit=\r\nerally\n&gt; &gt; hundreds of times, but in none of the mantras has he been referr=\r\ned to as a\n&gt; &gt; planet!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As is evident from the translation of the m=\r\natras in question, apart from the\n&gt; &gt; shanti-paath etc. etc., one cannot, b=\r\ny any stretch of imagination, come to\n&gt; &gt; the conclusion that Brihaspati in=\r\n these mantras is the same inanimate\n&gt; &gt; wandering body that was bombarded =\r\na few years back by comet Schumacher-Levi!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If in spite of all thes=\r\ne clarifications, some =E2=80=9CVedic astrologers=E2=80=9D keep on\n&gt; &gt; repe=\r\nating =E2=80=9CBrihaspati has been referred to in the Vedas as Putra-karaka=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; planet=E2=80=9D, I am really doubtful about their intentions as well a=\r\ns their level\n&gt; &gt; of knowledge of the Vedic lore.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Better be ware o=\r\nf such wolves in sheep=E2=80=99s clothing!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jai Shri Ram!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nA K Kaul\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Re: Answers to A.K.Kaul\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In JyotishGroup@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, &quot;rajvats62&quot; &lt;rajvats62@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kaul Ji,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I c=\r\nonveyed ur message to Lalit Ji, but, my personal expectation from\n&gt; &gt; you i=\r\ns to address points raised by him in public, reason being when you\n&gt; &gt; wish=\r\n to let down vedic jyotish you post &quot;rancour&quot; in hundreds of the\n&gt; &gt; groups=\r\n stating astrologers are not able to reply you, now, you got\n&gt; &gt; strong rep=\r\nlies to most questions whose answers you always expected from\n&gt; &gt; astrologe=\r\nr community, so, don&#39;t evade.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He earlier gave you a Rik Mantra in =\r\nwhich Jup is mentioned as a planet\n&gt; &gt; appearing in the sky.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We kn=\r\now that Yagyavalka Smriti and other Dharm Sutras are written before\n&gt; &gt; adv=\r\nent of Greeks in country and Megasthenes ( 350 =E2=80=93 290 BC) has\n&gt; &gt; me=\r\nntioned their existence in his work.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We also wish to get enlighten=\r\ned by your post in this regard.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ~Raj.\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
