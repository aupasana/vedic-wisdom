Ultimately experience is what counts. So I will not=\r\n argue with you about what God is, as I have nor experienced this yet (have=\r\n only read about it).\n\nThe saints all declare the Name is God. So I will si=\r\nmply stick to repeating the mantra and see what happens. God has to give Da=\r\nrshan to all of us one day, I cannot be left behind forever. :) Till then, =\r\nI enjoy reminding myself that the saints say that Name is even superior to =\r\nform. Krishna&#39;s Name on a tulsi leaf weighed more than He Himself. I may no=\r\nt have seen the form of Hari but I have access to His Name. Will make the m=\r\nost of this blessing.\n\nI agree honey and water Is soothing for the throat- =\r\nI wish you every success with your chanting. :)\n\nWarm regards, \n\nAparna \n\n\n=\r\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi, =A0\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0also, to attain the formless God tha=\r\nt is beyond them both.\n&gt; \n&gt; wow, wow, wow =A0Who told you this thing? Was i=\r\nt Dalai Lama? Was he telling you about --Shonya-- and other things to entic=\r\ne you to his side? It is not fair. We need you on our side.Pleezzzz\n&gt; \n&gt; Th=\r\nere is no formless God that is beyond them Both.In the old days Kings/Queen=\r\ns will keep someone near them in their kingdom and also send some other to =\r\nfar away place which is in their kingdom as well. The far away place is ful=\r\nl of bliss and the person is submerged in it and would lose their identity.=\r\n Near person will remain with the Divine Beings and would experience love& =\r\naffection, bliss&happiness holi& Diwali with their identity.\n&gt; \n&gt; =A0You kn=\r\now what, the thing is that you have had not yet the Darshan of Divine Mothe=\r\nr. It has not happened with you that Divine Mother has called you and given=\r\n HER MANTRA to you. It has not yet happened that you are coming back from a=\r\n Temple in India and you are weeping uncontrollably because you do not know=\r\n when you will come back. you have not yet received your pass so you can en=\r\nter in to Her Lila. I guess you will have to just wait for door to open. An=\r\nd once this happens you will change many of your thought as sure as sun ris=\r\nes in the east.\n&gt; It is true someone can go in to that bliss state without =\r\nhaving a Darshan of Divine Beings. It is also true that after reaching that=\r\n bliss state one can have Darshan as well. I prefer and want to hold the Fe=\r\net of Divine Mother.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have tickled you so many times so you have to g=\r\nive me some suggestions now. Everyday I recite several prayers and mantras =\r\nin a continuous stream for so many hours.I dare not say how many.I also do =\r\nsimilar thing for my mother who is very old, sitting next to her and placin=\r\ng my hand her head. Last several months my throat muscles have become very =\r\ntired and painful. I know using honey and warm water sometimes help. Any wo=\r\nrkable suggestions from you and other devotees would be really appreciated.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; LaxmiNarayan\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: sunrise_1080 &lt;sunr=\r\nise_1080@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Sent: Saturday, 30 June=\r\n 2012, 22:19\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mahamrityunjaya and Divine Namap=\r\nathy\n&gt;  \n&gt; Hi LaxmiNarayanji,\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s very interesting to hear about your=\r\n experiences with the Name. \n&gt; \n&gt; I agree with your suggestion that She be =\r\nworshipped for Her sake as well, not just for attaining Him. But in my mind=\r\n, Durga, Lakshmi, Hari and Hara are all One, so I feel I worship them all w=\r\nhen I say the mantra Om NamoNarayanaya (for that matter, I feel I worship A=\r\nllah, Buddha and Jehovah too when I repeat this mantra). I feel all these e=\r\nxist in Narayana. While I love the forms of Hari and Durga especially, and =\r\nfind them the easiest to talk to, I also find the forms of Radha and Shiva =\r\nenchantingly beautiful. The Hare Krishnas say that Krishna can only be atta=\r\nined through the Grace of Radha. Many saints have said in the past that the=\r\n mother is always easily accessible, always close to her children, keeping =\r\nan eye on them and they can speak with her freely.....the father tends to b=\r\ne a bit more distant....and only the Mother can introduce a child to it&#39;s F=\r\nather! This idea sort of appeals to my mind. So I pester/worship Durga to a=\r\nttain both Hari and Her too\n&gt;  (they are One of course). And also, to attai=\r\nn the formless God that is beyond them both. I feel it is She who keeps me =\r\non the path, and keeps my sadhana going. Without her, there&#39;s no doubt, tha=\r\nt all would be lost. \n&gt; \n&gt; Dubeyji,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the links....I found th=\r\ne articles very interesting. Not quite sure what to make of the one on slee=\r\np paralysis, but all I can say is, I will certainly keep up the chanting be=\r\nfore bedtime! \n&gt; \n&gt; Best wishes,\n&gt; \n&gt; Aparna\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=A0 =A0 =A0It was nice to see =A0your letter and read about your experience=\r\n. There is no need to feel embarrassment as a great deal of people feel unh=\r\nappy talking about ghost/spirit although they might say otherwise. And what=\r\n you experienced was very frightening at such a young age but it will prove=\r\n positive for you in future. One day soon or later you will become a teache=\r\nr yourself and give Diksha to others and if somebody asks your help in such=\r\n a situation you will draw on your experience and not on some bookish knowl=\r\nedge.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =A0I have to say that I have experienced a great deal of suc=\r\nh similar disturbing incident . Each and every time I have been saved by Gr=\r\nace of Divine mother. I will woke up shouting and reciting Divine names. So=\r\nmetimes I would know what might be the cause of such a attack. I never dism=\r\niss such incidents as just my imagination=A0and try to take proper action b=\r\ny going over the things I have done previous day. I am also able to see ver=\r\ny easily spirits/beings etc and some years back I used to give deep healing=\r\n to certain persons whom I had never met so they might go to higher dimensi=\r\nons and become free from cycle. And I always ask Divine Mother&#39;s permission=\r\n for it. Last year in Oct. ancestors of very famous family in England sudde=\r\nnly appeared in my front room where I was doing my everyday japa and indica=\r\nted they need similar sort of healing. They were a couple who were very fam=\r\nous when they were alive. I became very nervous and got up and avoided touc=\r\nhing them\n&gt; &gt;=A0 and went to my Puja Room to ask for guidance. Divine Mothe=\r\nr immediately refused any healing for them through me. They have sort of di=\r\nsappeared since then.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am puzzled by something you said.You will =\r\npester -Her- for help. Help for What?? They are Sister And Brother and in f=\r\nact They are One and Same. This world is creation of Divine Mother. She is =\r\nin it and also far away from it.And when She is meshed up with Her devotees=\r\n She feels joy and pain as well. And if you will pray and worship Her for t=\r\nhis reason She might not say anything but some heart string will not play r=\r\night. And Her Big Brother will also look at Her. I would hold Her Feet for =\r\nHer sake and do the likewise for Divine Lord.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When I was living in=\r\n Brijbhoomi, it was the ashram of disciples of Swami Shivanand =A0where I h=\r\nave rented a room. When I came back to London I kept receiving pamphlets fr=\r\nom the Sivanand Yoga centre for several years. I never attended any worksho=\r\np there but I used to cut out the pictures and names of Divine Mother and k=\r\neep them in my books.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; LaxmiNarayan\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ________________________________\n&gt; &gt;=A0 From: sunrise_10=\r\n80 &lt;sunrise_1080@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday=\r\n, 28 June 2012, 19:09\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mahamrityunjaya and D=\r\nivine Namapathy\n&gt; &gt;=A0 \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hello LaxmiNarayanji,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks=\r\n for the encouraging message. The thought of Vishnu turning on his watery r=\r\nesting place and glancing in this direction is rather sweet. You&#39;ve motivat=\r\ned me to do the mantra with even more enthusiasm now. Thank you. :) I will =\r\npester Her for help with this......Ramakrishna says you have to keep tuggin=\r\ng at Her sari till she gives you something vaguely worthwhile like devotion=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Very interesting to hear of your experience in Delhi. I agree th=\r\nat the Name provides protection against dodgy situations. I don&#39;t like to t=\r\nhink about ghosts/spirits etc.... I&#39;m embarrassed to say that have always b=\r\neen scared of the dark since childhood, slowly getting over it now. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Once at university, around 7 years ago, I was preparing for some exams. =\r\nIt was after term-time and I had stayed back to revise.=A0 I was moved to a=\r\n room that was different to the one I had been staying in, as my usual room=\r\n was being used for some conference guests. I used to hang out with the Har=\r\ne Krishnas then, and was really into chanting the Hare Rama mahamantra then=\r\n (still love this mantra, but chant Om NamoNarayanaya more now)- used to do=\r\n 2 hours a day and it made me feel good. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was lying on my back i=\r\nn this new room trying to sleep around 11 pm, and was in some sort of light=\r\n sleep state. At that point I had a very nasty sensation that can only be d=\r\nescribed as something or someone trying really hard to strangle me! I felt =\r\nvery frightened, and couldn&#39;t move, speak or wake myself up.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In th=\r\nis state, my mind started repeating &quot;Hari, Hari, Hari,Hari, Hari&quot; very very=\r\n fast in terror. I think I chose this name because it was short and I could=\r\n say it very fast with concentration! The frightening experience then passe=\r\nd and I felt the Name saved me.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I woke up and turned on the light =\r\nfeeling absolutely petrified and unable to go back to sleep. I then did som=\r\nething I wouldn&#39;t normally do. I rang the Sivananda Yoga centre in London a=\r\nt that time of night (I knew they don&#39;t sleep till about midnight as I&#39;ve s=\r\ntayed there) and had the nerve to ask to speak with a senior lady Swami who=\r\n initiated me into my chosen mantra. Despite the late hour of 11 pm, she ve=\r\nry kindly came to the phone and reassured me saying it could have been some=\r\n real negative force or just something from my imagination. Either way, she=\r\n reassured me saying I had done nothing wrong to cause it, and repeating th=\r\ne Name was the right approach. She suggested chanting before bedtime to avo=\r\nid similar experiences. I then chanted some rounds of the Mahamantra before=\r\n going to bed and slept fine (had to sleep with the light though on because=\r\n I&#39;m a coward ;).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Since then, I keep up the practice of repeating =\r\nthe Name before bedtime. I feel it keeps the err...nasties..away! And bring=\r\ns positive Divine energy to my mind ensuring better sleep. :)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best=\r\n wishes,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Aparna\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wis=\r\ndom@yahoogroups.com, Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =A0=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0Hello,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 =A0 Thanks for writing this mail and the=A0link=\r\n to to the article.=A0.=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is a very powerful and sacr=\r\ned mantra and I am sure regular japa=A0brings peace and protection.

It is weird to see how the body loses all importance =\r\nthe moment it dies. It is also strange how a dead body looks just like an e=\r\nmpty house...exactly like someone just left. It certainly makes one think t=\r\nhat there must be something more to us than this fleshy cage. This cage tha=\r\nt becomes unattractive in old age, filled with appalling miseries in seriou=\r\ns illness, and hideous in death. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is interesting to think a=\r\nbout what one can do to help the sick and dying, when they reach a stage be=\r\nyond all human aid. It is not pleasant to watch someone die while feeling u=\r\ntterly helpless to relieve suffering. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sivananda used to have =\r\ngreat faith in the Name- he used to call it &quot;Divine Namapathy&quot;. While moder=\r\nn medicine, Ayurveda, Reiki etc all have their place, he used to say that, =\r\nNamapathy was an outstanding way to prevent disease and heal us on all leve=\r\nls- physical, mental and spiritual. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; While he said all names o=\r\nf God- Rama, Allah, Buddha, Jehovah- are equal, he often mentioned the Maha=\r\nmrityunjaya mantra specially for healing purposes. And especially for those=\r\n who are very sick or dying.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He says &quot;MahaMrityunjaya Mantra w=\r\nill remove accidents, incurable diseases and bestow long life and immortali=\r\nty. It is a Moksha Mantra too.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I visited the Sivananda Charit=\r\nable hospital in Pattamadai, Tamil Nadu some years ago, and the doctors and=\r\n nurses who work there, start the day with chanting of mantras (including t=\r\nhe Mahamrityunjaya) for their patients, each other and the whole world. I b=\r\nelieve it is the same with the little Ashram hospital in Rishikesh. What a =\r\nwonderful way to start the day.....repeating mantras with your colleagues. =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I wanted to mention the power of this mantra for anyone who k=\r\nnows people who are sick/seriously ill (or indeed, if you yourself are unfo=\r\nrtunately unwell). It is simply to invoke the blessing of God to ease suffe=\r\nring, or to help bear suffering better. Basically saying &quot;Thy Will be done&quot;=\r\n because You know what is best. Of course it is NOT asking for a miracle cu=\r\nre (unless that happens to be the Will of God). \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; At any point =\r\nin time, there are several human beings, animals and various creatures who =\r\nare dying, and unfortunately suffering greatly during the process of dying.=\r\n I think it would be nice to repeat this mantra a few times daily to reduce=\r\n their misery. Our sages say it works, and I believe them. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He=\r\nre is a link for those who are interested in learning more about this great=\r\n mantra.
