This idol has its trunk to the right side and has been there in our house since the last 56 years. I recently came to know that when an idol of Shri Ganesha with its trunk to the right is kept at home one needs to worship it daily in a dedicated way and we have honestly not being doing this all these years. It was infact purchased by my grandmother 56 years ago as per my father who has been seeing it since then. \n\nI feel that it is better to donate it to a temple which would worship it daily. As it has been there for so long in the house we are feeling hesitant about doing this. Would be extremely grateful if I could have advice as to what would be the correct thing to do and how to go about doing the same.\n\nKindly pardon me if this is not the appropriate forum for such a query.\n\nThanks,\nRamesh M\nBangalore \n\nFitness on your mind?
