To give an instcance, I know a friend who is doing Homa, Chan=\r\ndi paath and such Sadhana for few years. though he has devotion to form of =\r\nMother Goddess, he has no desire for Mahavidya sadhana and does not even do=\r\n casual search for any informnations on the internet. he knows that Mother =\r\nwill provde the intense desire and resources at the right time if at all th=\r\nat Sadhana is needed.\nreally, for almost everybody, specifically for people=\r\n got in to family business, the only bhavana needs to be developed is to be=\r\ncome a child of Supreme Mother (Jagadamba or Rama or Krishna or Shiva or Bu=\r\ndhha or Guru or Rishi or jesus or Allah or...) in present world.      \nI ha=\r\nve highest admiration for Thakur Ramakrishna or Vimalananda because they bo=\r\nth gave the Identical message which is the most important message of our ti=\r\nme atleast-IMO. &quot;Be a child in the lap of devine Mother&quot; and then Mahavidya=\r\n or even post-Mahavidya will be provided, if needed.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal\n=\r\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; All this is just a tamasha.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mahavidya m=\r\neans supreme knowledge.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mahavidyas are those subtle forms of the primo=\r\nrdial energy that create \n&gt; various fine bindings within the field of duali=\r\nty that are very \n&gt; difficult for ego to break free from.

Even so called Vedic Sadhanas are often done for mate=\r\nrial \n&gt; &gt; gains. Recall how most of the Sanskrit stotras of various deities=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; contain a phalastuti (the expected results), is that not material \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; gain? Doing a Mahamrityunjaya Mantra for health benefits, isn&#39;t that a \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; material gain? It is not the path, but the attitude of the sadhaka \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nwhich determines for what he/she is performing a certain sadhana.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Y=\r\nogis and/or those who do sadhana using &#39;Vedic&#39; tools also acquire \n&gt; &gt; sidd=\r\nhis. Yogis acquire siddhis, which can come as a byproduct of the \n&gt; &gt; path.=\r\n The problem is not with siddhis per se, it is with misusing them \n&gt; &gt; or c=\r\nommercializing them or hanging on to them. Any sadhaka who can \n&gt; &gt; gain a =\r\nsiddhi, can also let go of that siddhi whenever he/she wants.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Speak=\r\ning of Karma, everything has a karma of it&#39;s own. Tantra, as it \n&gt; &gt; stands=\r\n today, is roughly divided into two major geographic and \n&gt; &gt; philosophical=\r\n demarcations. The style practiced in South India - \n&gt; &gt; mostly Dakshina Ma=\r\nrgi - and that practiced in Bengal and adjacent \n&gt; &gt; areas - mostly Vama Ma=\r\nrgi. In my personal opinion, the adherents of \n&gt; &gt; the path in both cases, =\r\ngenerally speaking, have been trapped in two \n&gt; &gt; delusions born out of col=\r\nlateral byproducts of their respective paths. \n&gt; &gt; The first step of Shakti=\r\n sadhana is generating shakti. Second step is \n&gt; &gt; holding the shakti. Thir=\r\nd step is channeling the shakti. In view of \n&gt; &gt; this, one school of Tantra=\r\n that is prevalent today has tied itself up \n&gt; &gt; in too much of technicalit=\r\nies, such that on an average they forget to \n&gt; &gt; capture shakti (here shakt=\r\ni means energy, not Shakti the supreme \n&gt; &gt; Goddess). WHile the other schoo=\r\nl is able to generate and hold shakti \n&gt; &gt; much better, only to commerciali=\r\nze the same and/or misuse it \n&gt; &gt; (generally  speaking,  expcetions are the=\r\nre too). End result, both \n&gt; &gt; eventually do not end up producing enough ge=\r\nnuine Tantrik saints.\n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; i am wondering &quot;if at all&quot; and &quot;what kind&quot; of =\r\nkarmic liabilities \n&gt; &gt; one might be getting into ?&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; A fair exchange i=\r\ns never a robbery, as Vimalananda says. \n&gt; &gt; Theoretically, when the *right=\r\n person* performs many of the things \n&gt; &gt; mentioned in that blog, (and some=\r\n of the stuff there is not exactly \n&gt; &gt; accurately portrayed), he/she will =\r\nknow how to balance the karmic \n&gt; &gt; impact well. In the hands of an immatur=\r\ne individual, it can lead to \n&gt; &gt; disaster. Further, the so called division=\r\n between &#39;classical Tantra&#39; \n&gt; &gt; and &#39;folk Tantra&#39; is not as sharp and clea=\r\nr as it is made out there. \n&gt; &gt; Each influences the other and is very much =\r\nintermingled.=C3=82  Every \n&gt; &gt; sadhana in Vama Margi Tantra has a firm spi=\r\nritual basis.
