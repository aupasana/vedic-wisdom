Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namast=\r\ne,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thank you for the story. This parable is absolutely brilliant.\n&gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; I just want to point out one thing in the story. When the first robber (=\r\ntamas) wanted to kill, the second robber (rajas) interrupted him and execut=\r\ned his preference instead. However, the third robber (sattwa) could help on=\r\nly when the other two were away. This is very apt.\n&gt;  \n&gt; When one has both =\r\nrajas and tamas, rajas is capable of overriding tamas. However, sattwa will=\r\n flourish only when tamas and rajas are suppressed mostly. Sattwa will be p=\r\nassive when one also has considerable amounts of rajas or tamas.\n&gt;  \n&gt; One =\r\nwith a lot of tamas can increase rajas temporarily and make some progress. =\r\nAs a simple example, laziness in the matter of spiritual progress (i.e. tam=\r\nas) can be replaced with doing several rituals and reading books passionate=\r\nly (rajas). It is difficult to transition from tamas to sattwa straight awa=\r\ny. As one engages in rituals, reading books and contemplation, slowly the p=\r\nassion (rajas) is replaced by steadiness and equanimity (sattwa). When satt=\r\nwa becomes predominant in one&#39;s personality and rajas and tamas become negl=\r\nigible, one starts to make tremendous progress. But, until that happens, ra=\r\njas is useful to have!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yoursel=\r\nf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/g=\r\nroup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comc=\r\nast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;=\r\n Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; Sri Jaga=\r\nnnath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -----------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Me=\r\nssage ----- \n&gt;   From: Prasanth Jalasutram \n&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, October 06, =\r\n2009 3:09 AM\n&gt;   Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Sri Ramakrishna Parable About Satv=\r\na, Rajas, And Lamas Gunas\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Once, a man was going through a forest,=\r\n when three robbers fell upon him and robbed him of all his possessions. On=\r\ne of the robbers said, &quot;What&#39;s the use of keeping this man alive?&quot; So sayin=\r\ng, he was about to kill him with his sword, when the second robber interrup=\r\nted him, saying: &#39;Oh, no! What is the use of killing him? Tie his hand and =\r\nfoot and leave him here.&quot; The robbers bound his hands and feet and went awa=\r\ny. After a while the third robber returned and said to the man: &quot;Ah, I am s=\r\norry. Are you hurt? I will release you from your bonds.&quot; After setting the =\r\nman free, the thief said: &quot;Come with me. I will take you to the public high=\r\n way.&quot; After a long time they reached the road. At this the man said: &quot;Sir,=\r\n you have been very good to me. Come with me to my house.&quot; &quot;Oh,no!&quot; the rob=\r\nber replied. &quot;I can&#39;t go there. The police will know it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;   This world=\r\n itself is the forest. The three robbers prowling here are Satva, rajas, an=\r\nd lamas. It is they that rob a man of the Knowledge of Truth. Tamas wants t=\r\no destroy him.Rajas binds him to the world.\n&gt; \n&gt;   But Satva rescues him fr=\r\nom the clutches of rajas and tamas. Under the protection of Satva, man is r=\r\nescued from anger, passion and other evil effects of tamas.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Further,=\r\n Satva loosens the bonds of the world. But Satva also is a robber. It canno=\r\nt give man the ultimate Knowledge of Truth, though it shows him the road le=\r\nading to the Supreme Abode of God.Setting him on the path, Satva tells him:=\r\n &quot;Look yonder. There is your home.&quot; Even Satva is far away from the knowled=\r\nge of Brahman.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Source: Tales and Parables of Sri Ramakrishna\n&gt;   --\n=\r\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
