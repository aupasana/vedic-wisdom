Sexual desires rise when the mind is in the\nsecond lotus, the sexual organ. When it is in the third, the navel, the man\nis taken up with things of the world--eating, drinking, begetting children.\n\nIn the fourth mental plane the heart of the man is blessed with the Vision\nof Divine Glory and he cries out: &quot;What is all this! What is all this!&quot;\n\nIn the fifth plane the mind rests in the throat. The devotee, talks only on\nsubjects related to God and grows impatient if any other subject comes up in\nthe course of conversation.\n\nIn the sixth plane the mind is localized between the eyebrows.The devotee\ncomes face to face with God; only a thin glass-like partition, so to speak,\nkeeps him separate from the Divine Person. To him God is like a light within\na lantern, or like a photograph behind a glass frame.\n\nHe tries to touch the Vision, but he cannot. His perception falls short of\ncomplete realization, for there is the element of self-consciousness, the\nsense of &quot;I,&quot; kept to a certain extent. In the last or seventh plane it is\nperfect Samadhi. Then all sense-consciousness ceases and absolute\nGod-consciousness takes its place.\n\nIn this state the life of the saint lingers for twenty-one days, after which\nhe passes away. During these days he ceases to take any food. Milk, if\npoured into his mouth, runs out and never gets into the stomach.
