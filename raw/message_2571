Every region of India has mistakes of its own and none of them is perfect. Yet, there are realized souls from every region of India. So do not worry about all this and follow whatever you were taught. As time goes on, if you find out a mistake and are convinced, you can change things from time to time. If you wait till you get perfect pronunciation, you will never even start. So start and keep improving your pronunciation. If you are lucky, it may end up not mattering also!\n \n2. A lot of horoscopic rules taught by some astrologers today are relevant only in special prayogas for ensuring certain material results. You can ignore them.\n \nYou can worship the deity you feel an attraction for, using the mantra that you feel an attraction for, without worrying about those things.\n \nDakshina Kali may force some level of detachment on you. If that is fine, you can do her mantra. Do not worry about number of letters, number of words etc.\n \n3. THAT is the nature of mind. As long as it is alive and active, that is what it does. Take cognisance of it and move on. If a heckler comes and disturbs your show, will you stop the show and leave? Or will you argue with the heckler. Neither is smart. A smarter thing would be to take a look at the heckler, say/do nothing and move on. Considered your meditation as a show and consider undesirable thoughts as just hecklers. Do not fight them, i.e. do not be agitated and start worrying about the thought. Do not give up and run away, i.e. do not stop the meditation. Just observe that fact that you had so and so thought and move on. Don&#39;t think too much about it (if you do, it will result in the seed of thought becoming a plant and then a tree!) and just continue.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- parijat_d &lt;parijat_d@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Respected Narasimhaji,\n&gt;                      Namaste. Thers a slight confusion in my mind regarding chanting mantras...\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.A mantra has a specific way of pronounciation.and i have seen there are several kinds of pronounciation...like here in bengal thers one way....in benaras another...and in southern india another way.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wich one is to be adopted ??\n&gt; \n&gt; 2.I have understood the bank balance analogy.I want to ask if chanting mantras of forms of shakti like Dakshina Kali wud be ok or not ??\n&gt; \n&gt; A reason for this confusion is that i have read the way the energy of a mantra is directed from one house in horoscope to another.Being only a novice in the vast field of astrology i am unable to decide my mantra.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also,at some point of time,i have read in this forum that horoscope represents the maya.So if i just want to show my love to the mother divine by chanting the mantra whenevr i get to do it ,be it in any state of mind and body,will my love take preference over the maya or the formula for energy direction will still apply ????\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 3.Now,that i have selected a mantra.During chanting or japa of it,contradictory thoughts do come in mind.Even sometimes i ask for material pleasures out of lack of focus during tha japa. So i am confused whether to continue the japa or not.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; This is a frequently asked question.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; If someone opening a new bank account has a very rich father who gives him money for the opening balance, one can start off with a million dollar balance. Of course, that helps. But, it is possible to squander that money and end up with a zero balance later.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Similarly, one without a rich father may open a bank account with a very small opening balance. But, if one works hard, one may end up very rich.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Your question is akin to asking whether a person who does not have a rich father can open a bank account. Of course, he can. He should open an account and work really hard to grow it.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Secondly, there are very very few people who have a good amount of shakti with any mantra and the capability to transfer some of it to someone else.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n\n\n"}}
