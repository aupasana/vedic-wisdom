I did not mean to say=\r\n otherwise.=C2=A0But just having an ishta devata is not enough to be &quot;prote=\r\ncted&quot; from deep and troublesome instabilities when one&#39;s body-mind complex =\r\ngoes through a big transformation. Not every aspiring devotee becomes a Pra=\r\nhlada - some become Ravanas. After all, out of the two examples Leelaji gav=\r\ne below for &quot;psychological disorder&quot;, the second lady &quot;did much sadhana of =\r\nSrirama&quot;. Even those who think of a deity and pray to him/her can end up wi=\r\nth hallucinations, mental and spiritual disorders, wrong (colored by one&#39;s =\r\nconditioning and desires!) interpretation of internal/external experiences =\r\nand even madness.=C2=A0True surrender/devotion to ishta devata will definit=\r\nely protect one, but cultivating it is as difficult as cultivating detachme=\r\nnt through wisdom! In fact, true surrender and detachment are almost the sa=\r\nme.=C2=A0This is why I said\n that *lightness of conditioning* is the most i=\r\nmportant thing. One with dense conditioning will find SOME way to fail even=\r\n if a great guru or god are ready to help.=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0Now, =\r\nthe question is: How do we reduce our conditioning? Unfortunately, there is=\r\n no single magic bullet. Thinking of a god, mantras, bhajans, japam, homam =\r\netc can help, but they need to be augmented by regular introspection and se=\r\nlf-improvement.=C2=A0Taking mind away from its current pre-occupations (e.g=\r\n. &quot;I am smart&quot;, &quot;I am doing good sadhana&quot;, &quot;I am mad at X&quot;, &quot;I did not get =\r\nwhat I deserve in Y&quot;, &quot;I am better than X&quot;, &quot;I must have Y at any cost&quot; etc=\r\n etc) is key to eventually overcoming conditioning, for these thoughts keep=\r\n *reinforcing* the conditioning!=C2=A0To reduce the regular pre-occupations=\r\n of mind, different imagery/visualization may work better for some people.=\r\n=C2=A0One approach is to contemplate god whenever possible, in the middle o=\r\nf any activity. You can\n imagine a being in your mind, either as an ideal/a=\r\nble person or as a principle/ideal/ability that exists in many beings, that=\r\n is so perfect and fascinating for the mind to contemplate that it does not=\r\n care about other objects around that are making shadripus and ashtapashas =\r\nwork on the mind. Whenever mind is about to entertain its regular debilitat=\r\ning pre-occupations, one can try to contemplate god instead.=C2=A0Mind is a=\r\n wild animal. As Pi says in the movie &quot;Life of Pi&quot; about the tiger on the b=\r\noat, wild animals can&#39;t be transformed or domesticated, but they can be tra=\r\nined into some habits!=C2=A0Whenever one is enjoying a sensual pleasure, if=\r\n one thinks &quot;the omnipresent God is enjoying this thru this instrument&quot; and=\r\n starts contemplating the qualities of that god instead of thinking too muc=\r\nh about limited sense objects, one is better placed to reduce the damage do=\r\nne by shadripus. Whenever one is angry at someone for what they did, if one=\r\n thinks &quot;the omnipresent\n God is giving me the fruits of my karmas thru tha=\r\nt instrument&quot; and starts contemplating the qualities of that god instead of=\r\n being angry at someone, one is better placed to reduce the damage done by =\r\nshadripus. And so on.=C2=A0In the beginning, even contemplation of god beco=\r\nmes laced with ego. Every now and then, the activity ends up becoming about=\r\n oneself rather than about god (&quot;*I* am doing this nice bhajan&quot;, &quot;*I* am do=\r\ning this nice homam&quot;, &quot;I think *I* am making progress through this&quot;). With =\r\neffort and perseverance, one can avoid making it about oneself and keep it =\r\ncentered on the supreme power that runs the show. Just as it takes a long t=\r\nime to train a wild animal, it takes a long time to train mind!=C2=A0Try to=\r\n develop devotion and surrender. Based on all that you read and heard, deve=\r\nlop of a concept/principle of god that is so superb and fascinarting. Visua=\r\nlize/contemplate that concept as frequently as possible, especially when me=\r\nditating. When mind veers\n off into other things, gently steer it back. Don=\r\n&#39;t spend too much time dissecting what mind is doing and why. Just put it b=\r\nack gently into contemplating god. Try to make it about god rather than abo=\r\nut yourself.=C2=A0The main drawback of the sadhana of most people is that t=\r\nhey make it about themselves at some level or the other. Though that is una=\r\nvoidable, try to break free from it.=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0Finally, on=\r\ne can try to overcome the limited sense of self and engage in selfless acti=\r\nons that benefit a larger set of people than oneself. What stops us from tr=\r\nuly loving god is our deep and sub-conscious love for *ourselves* (i.e. our=\r\n *limited* notion of self that drives the current body-mind complex). One w=\r\nay to overcome that is to selflessly love others. After all, other people a=\r\nround us are as much replicas of god as we are. If we cannot empathize with=\r\n them, love them and give them unconditionally, how can we ever hope to tra=\r\nnscend the\n limited sense of Self and truly love omnipresent God?=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;=\r\nBest regards,Narasimha--------Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://ww=\r\nw.vedicastrologer.org/\n&gt;&gt;--------\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;__________________________=\r\n______\n&gt;&gt;&gt;From: Leela Sastry &lt;leela.sastry@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@=\r\nyahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, Februar=\r\ny 28, 2013 10:35 PM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Kundalini syndrome\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0Dear Friends ,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0All psychosomatic or schizop=\r\nhrenic cases are not defined as=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 wrongly=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n experimented=C2=A0=C2=A0kundalini=C2=A0=C2=A0 experiences .

It is just A SMALL STEP in ov=\r\nercoming one&#39;s current limited identity.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Let me give an anal=\r\nogy. One wanting to move from one&#39;s small dilapidated house (this body-mind=\r\n complex) to a huge palace (realized Self) may first construct the palace o=\r\nver time and move into it when it is COMPLETE. Alternately, if one occasion=\r\nally goes and stays in the palace still under construction (analogy for out=\r\n of body experiences due to Kundalini rise), is it an achievement? In fact,=\r\n it comes with risks. The former approach is safer and one loses nothing in=\r\n it. Similarly, one can progress towards complete Self-realization without =\r\nany out of body experiences. These are not my word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasishth=\r\na&#39;s words to Lord Rama.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Secondly, one does not get something=\r\n without wanting it and putting sufficient effort towards it. One may have =\r\ndeeply desired a Kundalini rise in a previous life and may have put enough =\r\neffort. As a result, one may be getting it now. But one may be unprepared (=\r\nand ironically may not even want it!) when it comes in this life.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As you do sadhana, try not to fancy too many specific desires. Natu=\r\nre has a delay mechanism in granting your desires (because of constraints o=\r\nn what Nature can give you right now, arising from YOUR OWN previous action=\r\ns). So Nature sometimes gives you what you want LATE, when you no longer wa=\r\nnt it or want something else. For example, one may pray for great wealth on=\r\ne&#39;s whole life and be born as a rich but very sick man in next life. One ma=\r\ny not enjoy that wealth and pray whole life for health. In the life after t=\r\nhat, one may be very healthy, but not have any knowledge or money. In anoth=\r\ner case, one may deeply desire to act in a famous film. One may be reborn a=\r\ns a tiger or a dog and act in a famous film, but not really enjoy that expe=\r\nrience. Basically, people keep going in circles through various lives, alwa=\r\nys &quot;seeking&quot; something they are &quot;missing&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Anyway, coming ba=\r\nck to Kundalini, if one deeply desires an out of body experience given by a=\r\n rising Kundalini and one&#39;s previous karmas constrain one from having it in=\r\n THIS life, one may be born in next life with this specific desire destined=\r\n to fructify (if there is enough karmik force behind it).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessarily scary or pa=\r\ninful, if one is well-prepared in terms of attitude and detachment.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap. I went to free it and =\r\nit panicked so badly and started to shake violently. I went to save it from=\r\n a certain slow death and it was scared that I would kill it!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;We are like that chipmunk, glued to the mouse trap called this body-mind =\r\ncomplex and scared of being rescued from a certain slow death!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;If our ideas about who we are (viz this current body-mind complex) are i=\r\nncorrect and if we are this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a comple=\r\nte realization of that at some stage involve stepping out of this body-mind=\r\n complex, without being scared?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;Kundalini rise after most undesirable conditioning is overcome, is far be=\r\ntter than Kundalini rise forced when some really undesirable conditioning i=\r\ns still left in one&#39;s system.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;When one transcends one proble=\r\nmatic notion about who one is and what one needs, another notion that lay b=\r\nuried deeper in consciousness may spring to the surface and torment one. If=\r\n one overcomes the notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there may be another notion in o=\r\nne&#39;s body-mind complex that one&#39;s awareness clings on to (e.g. a great doct=\r\nor, a great leader, a great scholar, a great saint etc). As an extreme exam=\r\nple, if one person had a hidden deep desire to be a great soul who rescues =\r\nthe world, he may fancy that he is a re-incarnated X or Y who will rescue t=\r\nhe world now. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!) deeply clings to =\r\nany such notion, it can cause havoc. The person may show some signs of prog=\r\nress and yet remain in ignorance and get stuck badly.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;An awa=\r\nkened Kundalini in a system with undesirable conditioning may accentuate on=\r\ne&#39;s weaknesses and wrong notions heavily and cause serious psychiatric and =\r\nspiritual problems.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The best a=\r\npproach I recommend is to NOT think in terms of Kundalini and its rise. Jus=\r\nt do sadhana, overcome your weaknesses and improve your detachment over tim=\r\ne. Again, I want to emphasize that detachment is not disgust or distaste fo=\r\nr life/things/people around you. Disgust is the other side of coin of attac=\r\nhment. It is a negative attachment. =C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Don&#39;t worry about whether yo=\r\nur Kundalini rises or not. Worry about whether you are able to resist 6 int=\r\nernal enemies (shadripus) and 8 bondages (ashta pashas) or not. If your abi=\r\nlity to resist them is increasing, you are making progress. EVEN IF your Ku=\r\nndalini is fast asleep, you are still making progress. When you completely =\r\novercome them, Kundalini (your self-awareness) will automatically ascend to=\r\n the top and meet Her Lord (true Self).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;One word on surrendering to a personal deity. Though true surrender is=\r\n helpful, most people do not have it. They simply do business with god. Tho=\r\nugh people may be offended by my words, this is the plain and bare fact.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I want X, I will pray to you and please give it to me&quot;, &quot;I am=\r\n scared of Kundalini rise, I will pray to you and please protect me&quot; - all =\r\nthis is just a business deal. There is something you want and you ask god f=\r\nor it. True surrender has no place for agendas, desires, demands or expecta=\r\ntions. True surrender is losing oneself in one&#39;s fascination for the qualit=\r\nies of Lord. True surrender is accepting anything Lord throws one&#39;s way (wh=\r\nether it is pleasurable or highly painful) as Lord&#39;s prasad and accepting i=\r\nt gratefully. True surrender is thinking of Lord with fascination and pleas=\r\nure, even in the face of (and during) Death.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If one without =\r\ntrue surrender and with many desires and wrong notions experiences a Kundal=\r\nini rise, one may still be trapped, despite thinking of a personal god. It =\r\nis not that god does not want to &quot;protect&quot; one as said below. It is not abo=\r\nut protecting or endangering. If you go back to my &quot;chipmunk glued to mouse=\r\n trap&quot; example above, I was trying to protect it, but it was scared. Simila=\r\nrly, one&#39;s conditioning makes one *run away* from God&#39;s protection! God&#39;s p=\r\nrotection may seem to a conditioned mind like grave danger that one should =\r\nrun away from!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Whether through=\r\n the path of wisdom or surrender, develop dispassion and detachment. Realiz=\r\ne that all this is temporary and can be taken away anytime. Enjoy it while =\r\nyou have and keep doing your best, but be prepared to lose everything anyti=\r\nme. Only detachment and a very light mental conditioning (very light desire=\r\ns, dislikes etc) can protect one as one&#39;s Kundalini rises to meet True Self=\r\n. Heavy conditioning and impurities in one&#39;s nadis will distract rising Kun=\r\ndalini (self-awareness) and stop Her from meeting True Self.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;The real key is how light your conditioning is.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Best regard=\r\ns, Narasimha -------- Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.vedica=\r\nstrologer.org/\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;--------\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;________________=\r\n________________\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: Leela Sastry &lt;leela.sastry@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: =\r\n&quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: T=\r\nhursday, February 28, 2013 6:05 AM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kundali=\r\nni syndrome\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0YES=C2=A0 SIR=C2=A0 , perfectly c=\r\norrect=C2=A0=C2=A0 ,=C2=A0but intense bhakthi and saranagathi=C2=A0 makes t=\r\nhe ishtadevatha to stand by the sadhaka and remove most of the hurdles .=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0All the so called dhyanamargas with out any personal deity and man=\r\nthra allow the other entities to enter in to the inner planes who play havo=\r\nc with the=C2=A0 psyche .=C2=A0 Once we are under the protection of=C2=A0 a=\r\n mahadevatha ,all the other=C2=A0 disturbances will definitely=C2=A0 be wip=\r\ned off .

Constant effor=\r\nts of purification of the various elements that compose the human mind-body=\r\n structure. In simpler words this translates into more detachment, more equ=\r\nanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - =\r\nOnce and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, one has to now self iden=\r\ntify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a far more intense kin=\r\nd is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 - A good guru is ve=\r\nry helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really does - it can also op=\r\nen up the mind and body to various other things and entities, some of which=\r\n are not postive in nature while some of them are useless, and given half a=\r\n chance can make use of the individual for its own ends. They take hold of =\r\ninhernent weakness in character and nature and miss-utilizes the same. Henc=\r\ne constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more\n vital. 4 - While someday or othe=\r\nr every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini Shakti awekening and r=\r\nising up, not all maladies of psychology are because of this. The human psy=\r\nchology as understood by west today is puerile and insufficient to deal wit=\r\nh various things. It is also possible sometimes that the aura of an individ=\r\nual, which protects us from various subtle influences and helps us to remai=\r\nn as functional entities, can get &quot;ruptured&quot; due to various reasons, high s=\r\ntress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can allow free assess=\r\n of various entities inside the mind and they have chances of causing serio=\r\nus havoc. Since all these are very complex and various possiblities are the=\r\nre, it is not possible to list down every option. Moreover, even if such a =\r\ndiagnosis is correctly done, very few can have the right knowledge to recti=\r\nfy the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are often doing nothing mo=\r\nre than an intelligent guess work.\n Sometimes it will have results, sometim=\r\nes not. For all these to be achieved, the starting point is a sound mind in=\r\n a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used to say - Mens sana in corpore san=\r\no. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam many=\r\nantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;________________________________\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: sunrise_=\r\n1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, 28 February 2013 1:50 PM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] =\r\nKundalini syndrome\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dear all, Just wanted to warn=\r\n people of kundalini syndrome based on my recent experience of a patient of=\r\n mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at present, and have been involved in th=\r\ne care of someone who seems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening of=\r\n their kundalini since childhood. This has involved out-of-body experiences=\r\n and surges of energy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had neve=\r\nr heard of kundalini until her symptoms started and she searched for an exp=\r\nlanation. We have not been able to find anything physically wrong with her =\r\n(all tests normal)- so it might be that this is due to deranged kundalini. =\r\nMany people we call mentally ill describe themselves as having a spiritual =\r\ncrisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered int=\r\nerest and research into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately =\r\nthese patients are not well-understood by western medicine, and as we have =\r\nno treatments for deranged\n kundalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis=\r\n try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My experience with this lady confirme=\r\nd my feeling that kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman want=\r\ns to kill herself at times because the suffering from the deranged energy i=\r\ns so bad. She feels it will consume her, and it is something she cannot esc=\r\nape from. I wondered what solution there could be to her problem. The logic=\r\nal one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to =\r\nrelieve the suffering of this woman- and either cure her, or give her the s=\r\ntrength to bear this. May I request that the good samaritans among you pray=\r\n for her, and for others like her (whom we may not know of)- their sufferin=\r\ng really is pitiable. And let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end=\r\n up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is th=\r\ne safest. It is perhaps safest to say &quot;let me be your instrument&quot; and leave=\r\n the kundalini\n rising bit to God&#39;s will.

Not every aspiring devotee becomes a Prahlada - some become Rav=\r\nanas. After all, out of the two examples Leelaji gave below for &quot;psychologi=\r\ncal disorder&quot;, the second lady &quot;did much sadhana of Srirama&quot;. Even those wh=\r\no think of a deity and pray to him/her can end up with hallucinations, ment=\r\nal and spiritual disorders, wrong (colored by one&#39;s conditioning and desire=\r\ns!) interpretation of internal/external experiences and even madness.&lt;WBR&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;True surrender/devotion to ishta devata will definitely protect o=\r\nne, but\n cultivating it is as difficult as cultivating detachment through w=\r\nisdom! In fact, true surrender and detachment are almost the same.&lt;WBR&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;WBR&gt;This is why I said that *lightness of conditioning* is the most impo=\r\nrtant thing. One with dense conditioning will find SOME way to fail even if=\r\n a great guru or god are ready to help.&lt;WBR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;WBR&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;Now, the question is: How do we reduce our conditioning? Unfortun=\r\nately, there is no single magic bullet. Thinking of a god, mantras, bhajans=\r\n, japam, homam etc can help, but they need to be augmented by regular intro=\r\nspection and self-improvement.&lt;WBR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;Taking mind away from its cur=\r\nrent pre-occupations (e.g. &quot;I am smart&quot;, &quot;I am doing good sadhana&quot;, &quot;I am m=\r\nad at X&quot;, &quot;I did not get what I deserve in Y&quot;, &quot;I am better than X&quot;, &quot;I mus=\r\nt have Y at any cost&quot; etc etc) is key to eventually overcoming conditioning=\r\n,\n for these thoughts keep *reinforcing* the conditioning!&lt;WBR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;T=\r\no reduce the regular pre-occupations of mind, different imagery/visualizati=\r\non may work better for some people.&lt;WBR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;One approach is to conte=\r\nmplate god whenever possible, in the middle of any activity. You can imagin=\r\ne a being in your mind, either as an ideal/able person or as a principle/id=\r\neal/ability that exists in many beings, that is so perfect and fascinating =\r\nfor the mind to contemplate that it does not care about other objects aroun=\r\nd that are making shadripus and ashtapashas work on the mind. Whenever mind=\r\n is about to entertain its regular debilitating pre-occupations, one can tr=\r\ny to contemplate god instead.&lt;WBR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;Mind is a wild animal. As Pi s=\r\nays in the movie &quot;Life of Pi&quot; about the tiger on the boat, wild animals can=\r\n&#39;t be transformed or domesticated, but they can be trained into some habits=\r\n!&lt;WBR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;Whenever one is enjoying a sensual pleasure, if one\n think=\r\ns &quot;the omnipresent God is enjoying this thru this instrument&quot; and starts co=\r\nntemplating the qualities of that god instead of thinking too much about li=\r\nmited sense objects, one is better placed to reduce the damage done by shad=\r\nripus. Whenever one is angry at someone for what they did, if one thinks &quot;t=\r\nhe omnipresent God is giving me the fruits of my karmas thru that instrumen=\r\nt&quot; and starts contemplating the qualities of that god instead of being angr=\r\ny at someone, one is better placed to reduce the damage done by shadripus. =\r\nAnd so on.&lt;WBR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;In the beginning, even contemplation of god becom=\r\nes laced with ego. Every now and then, the activity ends up becoming about =\r\noneself rather than about god (&quot;*I* am doing this nice bhajan&quot;, &quot;*I* am doi=\r\nng this nice homam&quot;, &quot;I think *I* am making progress through this&quot;). With e=\r\nffort and perseverance, one can avoid making it about oneself and keep it c=\r\nentered on the supreme power that runs the show. Just as it\n takes a long t=\r\nime to train a wild animal, it takes a long time to train mind!&lt;WBR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nWBR&gt;Try to develop devotion and surrender. Based on all that you read and h=\r\neard, develop of a concept/principle of god that is so superb and fascinart=\r\ning. Visualize/contemplate that concept as frequently as possible, especial=\r\nly when meditating. When mind veers off into other things, gently steer it =\r\nback. Don&#39;t spend too much time dissecting what mind is doing and why. Just=\r\n put it back gently into contemplating god. Try to make it about god rather=\r\n than about yourself.&lt;WBR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;The main drawback of the sadhana of mo=\r\nst people is that they make it about themselves at some level or the other.=\r\n Though that is unavoidable, try to break free from it.&lt;WBR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;*&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp; *&lt;WBR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;Finally, one can try to overcome the limited sens=\r\ne of self and engage in selfless actions that benefit\n a larger set of peop=\r\nle than oneself. What stops us from truly loving god is our deep and sub-co=\r\nnscious love for *ourselves* (i.e. our *limited* notion of self that drives=\r\n the current body-mind complex). One way to overcome that is to selflessly =\r\nlove others. After all, other people around us are as much replicas of god =\r\nas we are. If we cannot empathize with them, love them and give them uncond=\r\nitionally, how can we ever hope to transcend the limited sense of Self and =\r\ntruly love omnipresent God?&lt;WBR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR:=\r\n transparent; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: arial, helvetica, clean, san=\r\ns-serif; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-SIZE: 13px&quot;&gt;Best regards,&lt;WBR&gt;Narasimha&lt;WB=\r\nR&gt;--------&lt;WBR&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://ww=\r\nw.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.vedicastr=\r\nologer.org/&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: transparent; FONT-STY=\r\nLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; COLOR: rgb(0,=\r\n0,0); FONT-SIZE: 13px&quot;&gt;--------&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;=\r\nBORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: arial, h=\r\nelvetica, sans-serif; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: times ne=\r\nw roman, new york, times, serif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;&lt;FONT siz=\r\ne=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BORDER-BOTTOM: #ccc 1px solid; BORDER-LEF=\r\nT: #ccc 1px solid; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; LINE-HEIGHT: 0; MARGIN: 5px 0px; PA=\r\nDDING-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; HEIGHT: 0px; FONT-SIZE: 0px; BORDER-TO=\r\nP: #ccc 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #ccc 1px solid; PADDING-TOP: 0px&quot; class=3D=\r\nhr contentEditable=3Dfalse readonly=3D&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-W=\r\nEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Leela Sastry &lt;leela.sastry@...&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-W=\r\nEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Thursday, February 28, 2013 10:35 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;S=\r\nPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: =\r\nKundalini syndrome&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1490316537&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPA=\r\nN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1490316537ygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND=\r\n-COLOR: #fff; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, serif; COLOR: =\r\n#000; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;Dear Friends ,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\nSPAN&gt;&nbsp;All psychosomatic or schizophrenic cases are not defined as&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrongly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; experimented&nbsp;&nbsp;kundalini&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp; experiences .

It is just A SMALL STEP in overcoming one&#39;s current limited identity.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Let me give an analogy. One wanting to move from one&#39;s small di=\r\nlapidated house (this body-mind complex) to a huge palace (realized Self) m=\r\nay first construct the palace over time and\n move into it when it is COMPLE=\r\nTE. Alternately, if one occasionally goes and stays in the palace still und=\r\ner construction (analogy for out of body experiences due to Kundalini rise)=\r\n, is it an achievement? In fact, it comes with risks. The former approach i=\r\ns safer and one loses nothing in it. Similarly, one can progress towards co=\r\nmplete Self-realization without any out of body experiences. These are not =\r\nmy word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Second=\r\nly, one does not get something without wanting it and putting sufficient ef=\r\nfort towards it. One may have deeply desired a Kundalini rise in a previous=\r\n life and may have put enough effort. As a result, one may be getting it no=\r\nw. But one may be unprepared (and ironically may not even want it!) when it=\r\n comes in this life.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;As you do sadhana, try not to fancy too m=\r\nany specific desires. Nature has a delay mechanism in granting your desires=\r\n (because of constraints on what\n Nature can give you right now, arising fr=\r\nom YOUR OWN previous actions). So Nature sometimes gives you what you want =\r\nLATE, when you no longer want it or want something else. For example, one m=\r\nay pray for great wealth one&#39;s whole life and be born as a rich but very si=\r\nck man in next life. One may not enjoy that wealth and pray whole life for =\r\nhealth. In the life after that, one may be very healthy, but not have any k=\r\nnowledge or money. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN id=3Dyiv1490316537yui_3_7_2_19_136206784661=\r\n9_141&gt;In another case, one may deeply desire to act in a famous film. One m=\r\nay be reborn as a tiger or a dog and act in a famous film, but not really e=\r\nnjoy that experience. Basically, people &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN id=3Dyiv1490316537yui_=\r\n3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&gt;keep going in circles through various lives, alw=\r\nays &quot;seeking&quot; something they are &quot;missing&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Anyway, coming bac=\r\nk to Kundalini, if one deeply desires an out of body experience given by a =\r\nrising Kundalini and one&#39;s\n previous karmas constrain one from having it in=\r\n THIS life, one may be born in next life with this specific desire destined=\r\n to fructify (if there is enough karmik force behind it).&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessarily scary or painful,=\r\n if one is well-prepared in terms of attitude and detachment.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nOnce I saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap. I went to free it and it panic=\r\nked so badly and started to shake violently. I went to save it from a certa=\r\nin slow death and it was scared that I would kill it!&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;We are l=\r\nike that chipmunk, glued to the mouse trap called this body-mind complex an=\r\nd scared of being rescued from a certain slow death!&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;If our id=\r\neas about who we are (viz this current body-mind complex) are incorrect and=\r\n if we are this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a complete realizati=\r\non of that at some\n stage involve stepping out of this body-mind complex, w=\r\nithout being scared?&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Kundalini ris=\r\ne after most undesirable conditioning is overcome, is far better than Kunda=\r\nlini rise forced when some really undesirable conditioning is still left in=\r\n one&#39;s system.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;When one transcends one problematic notion abou=\r\nt who one is and what one needs, another notion that lay buried deeper in c=\r\nonsciousness may spring to the surface and torment one. If one overcomes th=\r\ne notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there may be another notion in one&#39;s body-mind co=\r\nmplex that one&#39;s awareness clings on to (&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN id=3Dyiv1490316537yui=\r\n_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3Dyiv1490316537userContent&gt;e.g. a g=\r\nreat doctor, a great leader, a great scholar, a great saint etc&lt;/SPAN&gt;). As=\r\n an extreme example, if one person had a hidden deep desire to be a great s=\r\noul who rescues\n the world, he may fancy that he is a re-incarnated X or Y =\r\nwho will rescue the world now. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!) =\r\ndeeply clings to any such notion, it can cause havoc. The person may show s=\r\nome signs of progress and yet remain in ignorance and get stuck badly.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;BR&gt;An awakened Kundalini in a system with undesirable conditioning ma=\r\ny accentuate one&#39;s weaknesses and wrong notions heavily and cause serious p=\r\nsychiatric and spiritual problems.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR=\r\n id=3Dyiv1490316537yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_158&gt;The best approach I recom=\r\nmend is to NOT think in terms of Kundalini and its rise. Just do sadhana, o=\r\nvercome your weaknesses and improve your detachment over time.

There is something you want and you ask go=\r\nd\n for it. True surrender has no place for agendas, desires, demands or exp=\r\nectations. True surrender is losing oneself in one&#39;s fascination for the qu=\r\nalities of Lord. True surrender is accepting anything Lord throws one&#39;s way=\r\n (whether it is pleasurable or highly painful) as Lord&#39;s prasad and accepti=\r\nng it gratefully. True surrender is thinking of Lord with fascination and p=\r\nleasure, even in the face of (and during) Death.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;If one withou=\r\nt true surrender and with many desires and wrong notions experiences a Kund=\r\nalini rise, one may still be trapped, despite thinking of a personal god. I=\r\nt is not that god does not want to &quot;protect&quot; one as said below. It is not a=\r\nbout protecting or endangering. If you go back to my &quot;chipmunk glued to mou=\r\nse trap&quot; example above, I was trying to protect it, but it was scared. Simi=\r\nlarly, one&#39;s conditioning makes one *run away* from God&#39;s protection! God&#39;s=\r\n protection may seem to a conditioned mind like grave danger that one\n shou=\r\nld run away from!&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN id=3Dyiv1490316537yui_3_7_2_19_=\r\n1362067846619_141&gt;&lt;SPAN id=3Dyiv1490316537yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&gt;*&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Whether through the path of wisdom or surr=\r\nender, develop dispassion and detachment. Realize that all this is temporar=\r\ny and can be taken away anytime. Enjoy it while you have and keep doing you=\r\nr best, but be prepared to lose everything anytime. Only detachment and a v=\r\nery light mental conditioning (very light desires, dislikes etc) can protec=\r\nt one as one&#39;s Kundalini rises to meet True Self. Heavy conditioning and im=\r\npurities in one&#39;s nadis will distract rising Kundalini (self-awareness) and=\r\n stop Her from meeting True Self.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;The real key is how light yo=\r\nur conditioning is.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Best regards, Narasimha -------- As=\r\ntrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;A\n href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologe=\r\nr.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&lt;/A&gt;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: transparent; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT=\r\n-FAMILY: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-SIZE:=\r\n 13px&quot; id=3Dyiv1490316537yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_60 class=3Dyiv149031653=\r\n7yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_59&gt;--------&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1490316537yu=\r\ni_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_165&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR id=3Dyiv1490316537yui_3_7_2_19_13620=\r\n67846619_62&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot; id=\r\n=3Dyiv1490316537yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_65&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: a=\r\nrial, helvetica, sans-serif; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&quot; id=3Dyiv1490316537yui_3_7_2_1=\r\n9_1362067846619_168 class=3Dyiv1490316537yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_69&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, serif; FONT-SIZE:=\r\n 12pt&quot; id=3Dyiv1490316537yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_167 class=3Dyiv14903165=\r\n37yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_70&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DArial=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BORDER-BOTTOM: #ccc 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #ccc 1px solid;=\r\n HEIGHT: 0px; FONT-SIZE: 0px; BORDER-TOP: #ccc 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #cc=\r\nc 1px solid&quot; class=3Dyiv1490316537hr&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: b=\r\nold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Leela Sastry &lt;leela.sastry@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SP=\r\nAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com=\r\n&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: b=\r\nold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Thursday, February 28, 2013 6:05 AM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=\r\n=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syn=\r\ndrome&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1490316537&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;=\r\nDIV id=3Dyiv1490316537ygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #fff; FONT=\r\n-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, serif; COLOR: #000; FONT-SIZE: 1=\r\n0pt&quot; class=3Dyiv1490316537yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_79&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;Y=\r\nES&nbsp; SIR&nbsp; , perfectly correct&nbsp;&nbsp; ,&nbsp;but intense bhakt=\r\nhi and saranagathi&nbsp; makes the ishtadevatha to stand by the sadhaka and=\r\n remove most of the hurdles .&nbsp;&nbsp;All the so called dhyanamargas wit=\r\nh out any personal deity and manthra allow the other entities to enter in t=\r\no the inner planes who play havoc with the&nbsp; psyche .&nbsp; Once we are=\r\n under the protection of&nbsp; a mahadevatha ,all the other&nbsp; disturban=\r\nces will definitely&nbsp; be wiped off .

Constant efforts of purification of the various elements that compose th=\r\ne human mind-body structure. In simpler words this translates into more det=\r\nachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, gr=\r\need etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, one has=\r\n to now self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a far=\r\n more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 - =\r\nA good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really does=\r\n - it can also open up the mind and body to various other things and entiti=\r\nes, some of which are not postive in nature while some of them are useless,=\r\n and given half a chance can make\n use of the individual for its own ends. =\r\nThey take hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and miss-utili=\r\nzes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more vital. 4 - Whil=\r\ne someday or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini Shakt=\r\ni awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are because of th=\r\nis. The human psychology as understood by west today is puerile and insuffi=\r\ncient to deal with various things. It is also possible sometimes that the a=\r\nura of an individual, which protects us from various subtle influences and =\r\nhelps us to remain as functional entities, can get &quot;ruptured&quot; due to variou=\r\ns reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can =\r\nallow free assess of various entities inside the mind and they have chances=\r\n of causing serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and various pos=\r\nsiblities are there, it is not possible to list down every option. Moreover=\r\n, even if such a diagnosis\n is correctly done, very few can have the right =\r\nknowledge to rectify the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are ofte=\r\nn doing nothing more than an intelligent guess work. Sometimes it will have=\r\n results, sometimes not. For all these to be achieved, the starting point i=\r\ns a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used to say - &lt;SPAN c=\r\nlass=3Dyiv1490316537st&gt;Mens sana in corpore sano.&lt;/SPAN&gt; -Regards &nbsp;Raj=\r\narshi \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3Dyiv1490316537MsoNormal&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;=\r\nSPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 16px&quot; class=3Dyiv1490316537Apple-style-span&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SP=\r\nAN style=3D&quot;COLOR: rgb(153,153,153)&quot; class=3Dyiv1490316537Apple-style-span&gt;=\r\n&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york=\r\n, times, serif&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv1490316537yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249950 yiv149031=\r\n6537yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_92&quot;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabudd=\r\nhayah |&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; COLOR: navy; FONT-SIZ=\r\nE: 10pt&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv1490316537yui_3_2_0_2_134243506227946 yiv1490316537yui=\r\n_3_2_0_2_134243527249952 yiv1490316537yui_3_7_2_17_1362045432997_73 yiv1490=\r\n316537yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_93&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 face=3D&quot;Times Ne=\r\nw Roman&quot;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=\r\n=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif; FONT-=\r\nSIZE: 12pt&quot; class=3Dyiv1490316537yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_95&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=\r\n=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, serif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot; =\r\nclass=3Dyiv1490316537yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_96&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;&lt;FONT si=\r\nze=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BORDER-BOTTOM: #ccc 1px solid; BORDER-LE=\r\nFT: #ccc 1px solid; HEIGHT: 0px; FONT-SIZE: 0px; BORDER-TOP: #ccc 1px solid=\r\n; BORDER-RIGHT: #ccc 1px solid&quot; class=3Dyiv1490316537hr&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@yaho=\r\no.co.uk&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; vedic-w=\r\nisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/SPAN&gt;=\r\n&lt;/B&gt; Thursday, 28 February 2013 1:50 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: b=\r\nold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1490316537&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1490316537=\r\nygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome =\r\nbased on my recent experience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry=\r\n job at present, and have been involved in the care of someone who seems to=\r\n think she has had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since childho=\r\nod. This has involved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the b=\r\nody. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini until her=\r\n symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. We have not been abl=\r\ne to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it migh=\r\nt be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally i=\r\nll describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneou=\r\ns kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest and research into this t=\r\nopic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-un=\r\nderstood by western medicine, and as we have no treatments for deranged\n ku=\r\nndalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kun=\r\ndalini. My experience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini sh=\r\nould not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at times bec=\r\nause the suffering from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will co=\r\nnsume her, and it is something she cannot escape from. I wondered what solu=\r\ntion there could be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divi=\r\nne Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this =\r\nwoman- and either cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. May I re=\r\nquest that the good samaritans among you pray for her, and for others like =\r\nher (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. And let =\r\nus be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ourselve=\r\ns. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest=\r\n to say &quot;let me be your instrument&quot; and leave the kundalini\n rising bit to =\r\nGod&#39;s will. Om Dum Durgayai Namaha Aparna &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;HEIGHT: 0px;=\r\n COLOR: #fff&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;TABLE cellSpacing=3D4&gt;\n&lt;TBODY&gt;\n&lt;TR&gt;\n&lt;TD style=3D&quot;BACK=\r\nGROUND-COLOR: #f2f2f2; FONT-FAMILY: arial; COLOR: #fff; FONT-SIZE: 12px; FO=\r\nNT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;\n&lt;TD style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #f2f2f2; FONT-FAM=\r\nILY: arial; COLOR: #fff; FONT-SIZE: 12px&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;\n&lt;TD style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND=\r\n-COLOR: #f2f2f2; FONT-FAMILY: arial; COLOR: #fff; FONT-SIZE: 12px&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/TD=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;TD style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #f2f2f2; FONT-FAMILY: arial; COLOR: #fff; =\r\nFONT-SIZE: 12px&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;\n&lt;TD style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #f2f2f2; FONT-FAM=\r\nILY: arial; COLOR: #2d50fd; FONT-SIZE: 12px&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/=\r\nBLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/=\r\nBLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--473635693-1484199395-1362240521=:47771--\r\n\n"}}
