Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahams=\r\na compared the results of past actions to be\nlike\n&gt; &gt; a rope tied around th=\r\ne neck of a goat. Free will is restricted to\nthe\n&gt; &gt; amount of freedom the =\r\nrope allows one.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramakrishna is a master of explaining the toughest of =\r\nphilosophical\npoints using the simplest of analogies. His analogies are usu=\r\nally quite\napt and brilliant.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, karma or destiny (i.e. the result of=\r\n past actions) is like a rope\ntied to the neck of a goat. The rope restrict=\r\ns the movement of the goat,\nbut does not determine where the goat goes and =\r\nwhat it does! That is\nupto the goat&#39;s free will.\n&gt;\n&gt; A thirsty goat may loo=\r\nk at a river nearby and despair as it cannot\nreach the river due to the rop=\r\ne. It may try and struggle continually,\nwithout reaching the river. Another=\r\n thirsty goat may realize that it\ncannot reach the river, accept that, look=\r\n around, find a small bucket of\nwater behind it within reach if it negotiat=\r\nes with the rope and the\nobstacles. It may turn back, go, drink that water =\r\nin the bucket and be\nhappy.\n&gt;\n&gt; While the destiny as frozen at the time of =\r\nbirth (and as reflected in\nthe horoscope) is like the rope tying the goat a=\r\nnd the surroundings of\nthe goat, the actions of free will after birth are l=\r\nike the actions of\nthe goat - how it accepts and negotiates the rope and it=\r\ns surroundings\nto get what it wants.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Today&#39;s ac=\r\ntions (karma) are tomorrow&#39;s destiny (karma). Some of\ntoday&#39;s actions may i=\r\nmpact destiny in a future life. Some of today&#39;s\nactions may modify destiny =\r\nfor tomorrow (in this life itself!). Let me\nextend Ramakrishna&#39;s analogy to=\r\n explain it.\n&gt;\n&gt; A goat tied to a tree with a rope may go around the tree a=\r\n few times\nin one direction and the rope may get shorter. It may now be una=\r\nble to\nreach places it was able to reach earlier. Similarly, some bad acts =\r\nof\nfree will in this life may tighten the destiny, make things worse and\nre=\r\nduce one&#39;s options.\n&gt;\n&gt; It may go around the tree a few times in another di=\r\nrection and the\nrope may get longer. It may now be able to reach places it =\r\nwas unable to\nreach earlier. Similarly, some good acts of free will in this=\r\n life may\nimprove the destiny and make more things possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *=\r\n        *\n&gt;\n&gt; One&#39;s mind is conditioned based on one&#39;s destiny. One&#39;s surro=\r\nundings\nand life situations faced by one are influenced by one&#39;s destinty. =\r\nOne\nwill be pulled in certain directions. One may feel attraction for\nanoth=\r\ner person. Another person may hate one an, abuse one and throw\nobstacles. O=\r\nne may not have enough money to live happily. One may be\nadored by millions=\r\n of people. And so on. One faces different life\nsituations at different tim=\r\nes and in different matters.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, destiny only shows how one (and o=\r\nne&#39;s mind) is pulled in\nvarious directions and what life situations one fin=\r\nds oneself in.\nIrrespective of the mental conditioning and one&#39;s circumstan=\r\nces, one can\nstill choose between different actions. The actions taken by o=\r\nne are not\nfixed based on the horoscope. For example, one person may abuse =\r\none\nbadly and one may feel great anger towards that person, all on account\n=\r\nof a previous karmik debt. But, when badly provoked, one can either\nsuccumb=\r\n to the temptation and fight back or just ignore and move on.\n&gt;\n&gt; Destiny p=\r\nlaces you in different situations. What you do in those\nsituations is based=\r\n on how you use your free will. In some cases, free\nwill has a lot of wiggl=\r\ne room and many options and, in some cases, it\nhas fewer options. But, usua=\r\nlly, you do have several options that may or\nmay not be obvious and the act=\r\nion you finally choose shapes your destiny\nin a future birth.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        =\r\n*        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Please note that the Sanskrit word for destiny is karma and =\r\nthe\nSanskrit word for action is also karma. Basically, actions of today\nbec=\r\nome destiny of tomorrow. You will get reaction in future to your\ncurrent ac=\r\ntions and destiny is the sum total of those actions that will\ncome back to =\r\nyou.\n&gt;\n&gt; Each action of yours that impacts other beings and objects of this=\r\n\nuniverse will go towards forming your destiny for future. (Here please\nnot=\r\ne that both physical and mental actions count. Any emotions you feel\ntoward=\r\ns someone else and do not necessary express outwardly will also\nimpact that=\r\n person in a subtle manner and hence counts as an action.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Horoscope ca=\r\nptures the good and bad actions, committed physically or\nmentally to other =\r\nbeings, until the current birth, which are to give\ntheir reactions in this =\r\nlife. This is also known as destiny.\n&gt;\n&gt; It does not fix what you do in var=\r\nious situations in your current\nlife. You have the ability to make differen=\r\nt choices at important\ncrossroads. The choices you make are your karma (act=\r\nions) and they shape\nyour destiny for future. They may either impact your c=\r\nurrent life\nitself, or become part of the destiny (as reflected in the horo=\r\nscope) in\nthe next life.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Anybody who tells you =\r\nthat so and so houses show acts of free will\ndoes not understand what free =\r\nwill is. Horoscope is the frozen list of\npast karmas that form one&#39;s destin=\r\ny for this life. It is like the rope\ntying the goat. Acts of free will are =\r\nlike how the goat negotiates the\nrope and moves around within the possible =\r\narea to do its stuff. That is\nin the hands of the goat.\n&gt;\n&gt; The scope and o=\r\nptions available to free will can be estimated from the\nhoroscope, but the =\r\nexact acts of free will are unpredictable based on\nhoroscope. To complicate=\r\n things further, how exactly free will has been\nused until now in this life=\r\n (which cannot be seen from the horoscope)\nhas an impact on the scope and o=\r\nptions available to free will at this\ntime. The exertion of free will until=\r\n now may have modified the destiny.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; I am not do=\r\nwnplaying astrology. Going back to the original Chiranjeevi\nprediction, the=\r\n prediction that he would come into politics in 2007-2009\nand enjoy some ki=\r\nnd of power was made using astrology. When someone is\nalready a candidate, =\r\neven a random prediction of success or failure has\na 1/2 or 1/3 probability=\r\n. But, when there are no signs on the ground, a\nprediction on one&#39;s politic=\r\nal entry in a specific timeframe has a very\nlow probability. Such a low pro=\r\nbability prediction made 7 years ahead\nusing astrology came true. Moreover,=\r\n we have all seen many cases where\nastrology worked spectacularly. I am not=\r\n saying astrology is nonsense.\nBut I am saying that we do not attempt to un=\r\nderstand its shortcomings.\n&gt;\n&gt; When someone&#39;s free will works in a predicta=\r\nble way, i.e. when one&#39;s\nfree will has very few options and/or one reacts t=\r\no life situations\nthrown up by the destiny in predictable ways, job of an a=\r\nstrologer is\neasier. But, when free will has a wide range of options and/or=\r\n one used\nthe free will powerfully, the gap between the destiny as reflecte=\r\nd by\nhoroscope and the actual destiny as a result of those actions may make=\r\n\nan astrologer fail.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group=\r\n/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.=\r\nnet\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri=\r\n Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- On Wed, 5/=\r\n27/09, Shyam V.

At the time of that prediction, the=\r\nre were no such\nindications on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the ground. But he did come into p=\r\nolitics in the same\ntimeframe. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; initial talk was in 2007, he f=\r\ninally formed a party in 2008\nand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; elections were in 2009. Though =\r\nhis party did badly, he was\nelected as a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; legislator (MLA) in May =\r\n2009.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the original prediction was quite succe=\r\nssful. However,\nI upped\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the ante last year by suggesting that Chi=\r\nranjeevi&#39; s party\nwould do well\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in 2009 elections. Though I was n=\r\not specific regarding his\nlevel of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; success and did not predict th=\r\nat he would become the Chief\nMinister, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was honestly expecting h=\r\nis party to do better than they\nmanaged. Thus,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the followup of my=\r\n original prediction is a failure.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is my personal observation that the success rate in high\np=\r\nrofile\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; political predictions is less than in regular predictions =\r\nlike\nmarriage,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; job, childbirth etc in &quot;regular&quot; charts.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In some cases, the reason is that the birthdata is not\naccur=\r\nate and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yet we are eager to make predictions. But sometimes we ma=\r\nke\nbad\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predictions with good data too. Of course, it can be a hum=\r\nan\nerror in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; judging various factors. However, that human error se=\r\nems to be\na little\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more common in high profile political predicti=\r\nons than in\nregular\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predictions. What could be the reason?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wonder if the factor of free will that is left out of\na=\r\nstrology\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; plays a bigger role in political charts.

However, as life goes on, one accum=\r\nulates newer actions\ncommitted\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in THIS life using one&#39;s free will=\r\n. What happens at any point\nof time in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s life is a function o=\r\nf ALL actions committed by one until\nthat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point of time, INCLUDIN=\r\nG the actions committed in THIS life\nuntil now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some key actions =\r\ncommitted using one&#39;s free will in THIS life,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especially at impor=\r\ntant crossroads in life, should impact the\nlife\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; events from then =\r\nonwards.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Many people are weighed down by too many k=\r\narmas and always\nplaying a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; catchup. In other words, destiny (sum =\r\nof the actions of\nprevious lives\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which are to give a reaction now=\r\n) is too weighty and free will\nin this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; life has little scope. Whe=\r\nn the options available for the free\nwill in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this life are limite=\r\nd, there may not be significant actions\nusing free\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will and hence=\r\n the modifications to destiny based on actions\nof this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; life may n=\r\not be big enough. Thus, horoscope may be sufficient\nto predict\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ev=\r\nents.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, highly popular, successful and high =\r\nprofile public\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personalities may have less restrictions and more =\r\noptions\navailable for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their free will. With their free will being=\r\n more free and\npowerful, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actions committed by their free will=\r\n may have a higher\nweightage. As we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are able to see only their de=\r\nstiny in the horoscope (free will\nexercise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; upto birth) and unable=\r\n to factor in how free will was\nexercised in this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; life until now,=\r\n we are perhaps handicapped in our predictions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whe=\r\nther a political leader is in limelight and becomes MP or\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lea=\r\nder of opposition in parliament or the Prime Minister, he\nis enjoying\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; some political power. Previous karmas placed him in a position\nto enjo=\r\ny\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that power. To predict the specific degree of power and make\nan=\r\n accurate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prediction, is the horoscope sufficient always? Could t=\r\nhe\nexercise of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; free will in this life until now make a difference=\r\n in some\nhigh profile\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; charts?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am just thinking loud here.

His analogies are usually quite apt and brilliant.&lt;br&gt;&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&gt; Y=\r\nes, karma or destiny (i.e. the result of past actions) is like a rope tied =\r\nto the neck of a goat. The rope restricts the movement of the goat, but doe=\r\ns not determine where the goat goes and what it does! That is upto the goat=\r\n&#39;s free will.&lt;br&gt;&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&gt; A thirsty goat may look at a river nearby a=\r\nnd despair as it cannot reach the river due to the rope. It may try and str=\r\nuggle continually, without reaching the river. Another thirsty goat may rea=\r\nlize that it cannot reach the river, accept that, look around, find a small=\r\n bucket of water behind it within reach if it negotiates with the rope and =\r\nthe obstacles. It may turn back, go, drink that water in the bucket and be =\r\nhappy.&lt;br&gt;&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&gt; While the destiny as frozen at the time of birth (=\r\nand as reflected in the horoscope) is like the rope tying the goat and the =\r\nsurroundings of the goat, the actions of free will after birth are like the=\r\n actions of the goat - how it accepts and negotiates the rope and its surro=\r\nundings to get what it wants.&lt;br&gt;&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&gt; *        *        *&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n  &lt;br&gt;&gt; Today&#39;s actions (karma) are tomorrow&#39;s destiny (karma). Some of =\r\ntoday&#39;s actions may impact destiny in a future life. Some of today&#39;s action=\r\ns may modify destiny for tomorrow (in this life itself!). Let me extend Ram=\r\nakrishna&#39;s analogy to explain it.&lt;br&gt;&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&gt; A goat tied to a tree w=\r\nith a rope may go around the tree a few times in one direction and the rope=\r\n may get shorter. It may now be unable to reach places it was able to reach=\r\n earlier. Similarly, some bad acts of free will in this life may tighten th=\r\ne destiny, make things worse and reduce one&#39;s options.&lt;br&gt;&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&gt; It=\r\n may go around the tree a few times in another direction and the rope may g=\r\net longer. It may now be able to reach places it was unable to reach earlie=\r\nr. Similarly, some good acts of free will in this life may improve the dest=\r\niny and make more things possible.&lt;br&gt;&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&gt; *        *        *&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&gt; One&#39;s mind is conditioned based on one&#39;s destiny. One&#39;s sur=\r\nroundings and life situations faced by one are influenced by one&#39;s destinty=\r\n. One will be pulled in certain directions. One may feel attraction for ano=\r\nther person. Another person may hate one an, abuse one and throw obstacles.=\r\n One may not have enough money to live happily. One may be adored by millio=\r\nns of people. And so on. One faces different life situations at different t=\r\nimes and in different matters.&lt;br&gt;&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&gt; However, destiny only show=\r\ns how one (and one&#39;s mind) is pulled in various directions and what life si=\r\ntuations one finds oneself in. Irrespective of the mental conditioning and =\r\none&#39;s circumstances, one can still choose between different actions. The ac=\r\ntions taken by one are not fixed based on the horoscope. For example, one p=\r\nerson may abuse one badly and one may feel great anger towards that person,=\r\n all on account of a previous karmik debt. But, when badly provoked, one ca=\r\nn either succumb to the temptation and fight back or just ignore and move o=\r\nn.&lt;br&gt;&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&gt; Destiny places you in different situations. What you d=\r\no in those situations is based on how you use your free will. In some cases=\r\n, free will has a lot of wiggle room and many options and, in some cases, i=\r\nt has fewer options. But, usually, you do have several options that may or =\r\nmay not be obvious and the action you finally choose shapes your destiny in=\r\n a future birth.&lt;br&gt;&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&gt; *        *        *&lt;br&gt;&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&gt; Pl=\r\nease note that the Sanskrit word for destiny is karma and the Sanskrit word=\r\n for action is also karma. Basically, actions of today become destiny of to=\r\nmorrow. You will get reaction in future to your current actions and destiny=\r\n is the sum total of those actions that will come back to you.&lt;br&gt;&gt;  &lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; Each action of yours that impacts other beings and objects of this un=\r\niverse will go towards forming your destiny for future. (Here please note t=\r\nhat both physical and mental actions count. Any emotions you feel towards s=\r\nomeone else and do not necessary express outwardly will also impact that pe=\r\nrson in a subtle manner and hence counts as an action.)&lt;br&gt;&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&gt; H=\r\noroscope captures the good and bad actions, committed physically or mentall=\r\ny to other beings, until the current birth, which are to give their reactio=\r\nns in this life. This is also known as destiny.&lt;br&gt;&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&gt; It does n=\r\not fix what you do in various situations in your current life. You have the=\r\n ability to make different choices at important crossroads. The choices you=\r\n make are your karma (actions) and they shape your destiny for future. They=\r\n may either impact your current life itself, or become part of the destiny =\r\n(as reflected in the horoscope) in the next life.&lt;br&gt;&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&gt; *      =\r\n  *        *&lt;br&gt;&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&gt; Anybody who tells you that so and so houses =\r\nshow acts of free will does not understand what free will is. Horoscope is =\r\nthe frozen list of past karmas that form one&#39;s destiny for this life. It is=\r\n like the rope tying the goat. Acts of free will are like how the goat nego=\r\ntiates the rope and moves around within the possible area to do its stuff. =\r\nThat is in the hands of the goat.&lt;br&gt;&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&gt; The scope and options a=\r\nvailable to free will can be estimated from the horoscope, but the exact ac=\r\nts of free will are unpredictable based on horoscope. To complicate things =\r\nfurther, how exactly free will has been used until now in this life (which =\r\ncannot be seen from the horoscope) has an impact on the scope and options a=\r\nvailable to free will at this time. The exertion of free will until now may=\r\n have modified the destiny.&lt;br&gt;&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&gt; *        *        *&lt;br&gt;&gt;  =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; I am not downplaying astrology. Going back to the original Chiranj=\r\neevi prediction, the prediction that he would come into politics in 2007-20=\r\n09 and enjoy some kind of power was made using astrology. When someone is a=\r\nlready a candidate, even a random prediction of success or failure has a 1/=\r\n2 or 1/3 probability. But, when there are no signs on the ground, a predict=\r\nion on one&#39;s political entry in a specific timeframe has a very low probabi=\r\nlity. Such a low probability prediction made 7 years ahead using astrology =\r\ncame true. Moreover, we have all seen many cases where astrology worked spe=\r\nctacularly. I am not saying astrology is nonsense. But I am saying that we =\r\ndo not attempt to understand its shortcomings.&lt;br&gt;&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&gt; When someo=\r\nne&#39;s free will works in a predictable way, i.e. when one&#39;s free will has ve=\r\nry few options and/or one reacts to life situations thrown up by the destin=\r\ny in predictable ways, job of an astrologer is easier. But, when free will =\r\nhas a wide range of options and/or one used the free will powerfully, the g=\r\nap between the destiny as reflected by horoscope and the actual destiny as =\r\na result of those actions may make an astrologer fail.&lt;br&gt;&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&gt; Be=\r\nst regards,&lt;br&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;&gt; -------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------&lt;br&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www=\r\n.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&lt;br&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&lt;br&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/gr=\r\noup/vedic-wisdom&lt;br&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home=\r\n.comcast.net&lt;br&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstro=\r\nloger.org&lt;br&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJaganna=\r\nth.org&lt;br&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------ &lt;br&gt;&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; --- On Wed, 5/27/09, Shyam V.

Such people may feel that there i=\r\ns nothing called free will.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The amoun=\r\nt of leeway and wiggle room available for free may may vary from person to =\r\nperson and situation to situation, but it is a fact that free will exists a=\r\nnd that acts of free will shape one&#39;s future.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In JyotishGroup@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;gopi_b927&quot; &lt;g=\r\nopi_b927@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; Narasimha garu,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n how do we know that free will exists?.The so called free will can also&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be an asumption.As far as my experience goes whate=\r\nver freewill existed&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for humans might have exit=\r\ned.I know majority will never agree but&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; still..=\r\n....&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In JyotishGroup@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;Na=\r\nrasimha P.V.R.

At the time of that prediction, ther=\r\ne were no such indications on&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the ground. But h=\r\ne did come into politics in the same timeframe. The&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; initial talk was in 2007, he finally formed a party in 2008 and&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; elections were in 2009. Though his party did badly, h=\r\ne was elected as a&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; legislator (MLA) in May 2009=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, t=\r\nhe original prediction was quite successful. However, I upped&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the ante last year by suggesting that Chiranjeevi&#39; s party w=\r\nould do well&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in 2009 elections. Though I was no=\r\nt specific regarding his level of&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; success and d=\r\nid not predict that he would become the Chief Minister, I&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; was honestly expecting his party to do better than they managed.=\r\n Thus,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the followup of my original prediction i=\r\ns a failure.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; * * *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n It is my personal observation that the success rate in high profile&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; political predictions is less than in regular predict=\r\nions like marriage,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; job, childbirth etc in &quot;reg=\r\nular&quot; charts.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; In some cases, the reason is that the birthdata is not accurate and&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yet we are eager to make predictions. But sometim=\r\nes we make bad&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predictions with good data too. =\r\nOf course, it can be a human error in&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; judging v=\r\narious factors. However, that human error seems to be a little&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; more common in high profile political predictions than in r=\r\negular&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predictions. What could be the reason?&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wonder i=\r\nf the factor of free will that is left out of astrology&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; plays a bigger role in political charts. I will try to think loud =\r\nand&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; elaborate what I mean.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One&#39;s birth chart contains the l=\r\nist of actions committed in previous&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lives usin=\r\ng one&#39;s free will that are to give their reactions in this&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; life. However, as life goes on, one accumulates newer actions c=\r\nommitted&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in THIS life using one&#39;s free will. Wh=\r\nat happens at any point of time in&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s life i=\r\ns a function of ALL actions committed by one until that&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; point of time, INCLUDING the actions committed in THIS life until =\r\nnow.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some key actions committed using one&#39;s fre=\r\ne will in THIS life,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especially at important cr=\r\nossroads in life, should impact the life&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; events=\r\n from then onwards.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Many people are weighed down by too many karmas and always playi=\r\nng a&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; catchup. In other words, destiny (sum of t=\r\nhe actions of previous lives&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which are to give =\r\na reaction now) is too weighty and free will in this&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; life has little scope. When the options available for the free will i=\r\nn&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this life are limited, there may not be signi=\r\nficant actions using free&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will and hence the mo=\r\ndifications to destiny based on actions of this&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n life may not be big enough. Thus, horoscope may be sufficient to predict&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; events.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, highly popular, successful and high prof=\r\nile public&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personalities may have less restrict=\r\nions and more options available for&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their free =\r\nwill. With their free will being more free and powerful, the&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; actions committed by their free will may have a higher weight=\r\nage. As we&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are able to see only their destiny i=\r\nn the horoscope (free will exercise&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; upto birth)=\r\n and unable to factor in how free will was exercised in this&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; life until now, we are perhaps handicapped in our predictions=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whether=\r\n a political leader is in limelight and becomes MP or the&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; leader of opposition in parliament or the Prime Minister, he is =\r\nenjoying&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some political power. Previous karmas =\r\nplaced him in a position to enjoy&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that power. T=\r\no predict the specific degree of power and make an accurate&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; prediction, is the horoscope sufficient always? Could the exer=\r\ncise of&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; free will in this life until now make a=\r\n difference in some high profile&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; charts?&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am just thinking=\r\n loud here.
