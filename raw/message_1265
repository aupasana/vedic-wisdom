I remember reading some stories in Karthika Puran=\r\nam \nof a cruel and sinful person calling his son when he is about to die. \n=\r\nHis son is named after Siva. Merely by calling the gods name before \ndying,=\r\n the person attains punya loka! In another story, a hunter does \nnot get fo=\r\nod on a Karthika Monday and goes to a temple hoping some \nleft overs and as=\r\n it is dark, lights a lamp, and he gets the punya of \nupavasa and lighting =\r\nthe lamp. Neither of the above did this \nintentionally. But, perhaps, both =\r\nof them carried favorable karma from \ntheir respective past lives!\n\nRemembe=\r\nr the story of Kausikopakhyanam? (Kaushika once looks angrily \nat a crane a=\r\nngrily and it burns to ashes. That day Kushika goes \nbegging and looks at a=\r\n house wife angrily. The lady tells him that she \nis not the crane and surp=\r\nrised kaushika asks for secret of her \nstrength and she directs him to her =\r\nteacher who sells meat! The \nteacher explains Kaushika the importance of un=\r\nattached karma. Easy it \nsounds, but, not easy to practice.\n\nSo, it is usel=\r\ness to argue as to what is superior and what is \ninferior. All the differen=\r\nt paths are equally important and perhaps \nequally efficient provided we tr=\r\naverse that path efficently!\n\nChittasudhi is important to what ever sadhana=\r\n we do for which \ncontrolling out wandering mind and focusing on the ultima=\r\nte goal is \nthe single most challenge.\n\nEach of us may find different ways =\r\nto help us focus.\n\nFor example, I find doing the following 4 to be useful:\n=\r\n1. Doing Japam while facing Sun\n2. Doing Japam in front of a big portait of=\r\n Ramakrishna/temple\n3. Doing Japam while shower is running on me\n4. Doing J=\r\napam in front of Homam\n\nNow, do I need to find out which of the above is mo=\r\nre beneficial? I do \nnot think so. If I can control my mind 100%, then the =\r\nmeans does not \nmatter. I can do what ever I feel comfortable at the time. =\r\nFor now, I \nam doing homam.\n\nEach of you can try it out and you feel it is =\r\nhelping you more stick \nto it. The bottom line is control different thought=\r\ns that come to us.\n\nBest regards,\nVijay\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, &quot;m540i98&quot; &lt;m540i98@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste\n&gt; \n&gt; Kunjika Shotram is a very=\r\n powerful one, why do homan of it, atleast \nI \n&gt; have never heard anybody d=\r\noing it but I am very ignonart too, \ninstead \n&gt; there is a Durga Sapta Slok=\r\nas that may be more easier and lighter.\n&gt; \n&gt; Only one Shri agaram bagaram b=\r\naba (I am sure my spellings are wrong) \na \n&gt; disciple of swami muktananda h=\r\nas indicated that one can chant for 11 \n&gt; times daily and that is enough.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; He seemed to be very realized and lived near Nasik, someone has \nwritte=\r\nn \n&gt; his biography.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kunjika Shortram one recites to overcome any mista=\r\nkes one may have \ndone \n&gt; with reciting chandi paath. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; by the way o=\r\nne can listen kunjika shotram in beautiful voice of \nshree \n&gt; maa as follow=\r\ns\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.shreemaa.org/drupal/node/1546, on this page there is a \nl=\r\nink.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards\n&gt; Mitesh\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;=\r\nrajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For someone wh=\r\no cannot speak sanskrit or is not even very fluent \nwith \n&gt; &gt; any of the In=\r\ndian lnaguges, can such a person do a homa of the \n&gt; Kunjika \n&gt; &gt; Stotra in=\r\nstead of the actual full Durgasaptasati.
