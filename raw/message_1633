Sastri, I must say that Rajarshi&#39;s view \nis far more accurate and truthful to the scripture. In fact, Swami \nVivekananda also shared exactly the same view (i.e. Rajarshi&#39;s view) when \ncommenting on this story from Chhaandogypanishad!\n\n*        *        *\n\nThe specific line where mother Jabaalaa tells son Satyakaama about his gotra \nin Chandogyopanishad is:\n\n&quot;naahametadveda taata yadgotrastvamasi bahvaham charantii parichaariNii \nyauvane tvaamalabhe saahametanna veda yadgotrastvamasi&quot; (chhaandogyopaniShad \n4.4.2)\n\nLiteral meaning word to word is: taata = son, aham = I, na veda = not know, \netat = that, yat = which, gotras = gotra, tvam = you, asi = are, aham = I, \ncharantii = moving, bahu = a lot, parichaariNii = servant maid, yauvane = in \nyouth, tvaam = you, alabhe = got, saaham = thus I, na veda = not know, etat \n= that, yat = which, gotras = gotra, tvam = you, asi = are.\n\nLiteral translation without any interpretation (or spin) is:\n\n&quot;Son, I do not which gotra you are. I was a servant maid moving a lot in \nyouth when I got you. Thus, I do not know which gotra you are.&quot;\n\n*        *        *\n\nNow, I cannot reconcile Sri S.N. Sastri&#39;s interpretation with the above at \nall. Even today, in this deep Kali yuga, Brahmins do find out the gotra \nbefore marriage and avoid marrying people from the same gotra at any cost. I \nfind it strange that one would get married without finding gotra in old \ndays. In any case, there is no reference to such a thing above. There is \nalso no reference to early death of father. If she did not know the gotra \nbecause her husband died when child was young and she did not ask at the \ntime of marriage, she would&#39;ve explicitly said that and not say &quot;I was a \nservant maid moving a lot in youth when I got you. Thus, I do not know which \ngotra you are.&quot; If the true reason is that her husband died young, what is \nthe relevance of her being a servant maid and her moving a lot? Why would \nshe mention those irrelevant points and not her husband dying young?\n\nThus, I cannot support Sri S.N. Sastri&#39;s view at all. It seems quite \nfar-fetched and motivated to me.\n\n*        *        *\n\nIf one&#39;s conditioned mind cannot accept the fact that a maharshi accepted \nthe son of a woman who would be considered &quot;fallen&quot; by the moral standards \none is used to, then one would probably try to imagine things, twist the \nwords of a scripture and give an interpretation that fits with one&#39;s notions \nof right and wrong. But then, one would be missing out on the true morals of \nthe scripture and an opportunity to question and refine one&#39;s pre-exiting \nnotions of right and wrong...\n\n*        *        *\n\nLet us say an unmarried woman with good control over senses wanted a child. \nLet us say she slept with five men that she liked and respected, with mutual \nconsent, on five different occasions, not for carnal pleasure, but with the \nsole intention of begetting a child with any of them and then raising the \nchild alone.\n\nLet us say another person (man or woman) slept with the same person that one \nis ritually married to, on five different occasions, not with the intention \nof begetting a child but just for carnal pleasure (i.e. using birth control \nmethods).\n\nWhich is worse? Which has a higher purpose? Which more adharmik?\n\n*        *        *\n\nPrevalent rules of morality are there for general guidance. World will sink \ninto an abyss of chaos and adharma without them and they are definitely \nneeded. But they are not absolute.\n\nThe correct judgment of right and wrong does not always come from the \napplication of a set of rigid rules. Correct judgment comes only from a \nrefined and purified mind. Scriptures and actions of rishis and gods \ncontained in them (and actions of other great souls of recent centuries who \nwere most likely reincarnations of rishis and gods) are there to clarify and \nrefine our understanding of what is right and what is wrong. As we \nunderstand more and purify ourselves more, our judgment will become more and \nmore perfect.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n-----------------------------------------------\nOriginal Thread\n-----------------------------------------------\n1 Rajarshi:\n\nThe Chandogya Upanishad mentions this incident. The boy came to Gauthama \nRishi for knowledge and the Rishi asked him for his gotra. The boy goes back \nto his mother and finds out that his mother is not aware of who the father \nwas. The boy comes back and says the same to Rishi Guathama, who says that \nhe shall teach the boy as the boy belongs to the gotra of truth, and thus by \ndefault is a Brahmana.\n\n&quot;Thereupon the boy went to Gautama and asked to be accepted as a student. \n&#39;Of what family are you, my lad?&#39; inquired the sage. Satyakama replied: &#39;I \nasked my mother what my family name was, and she answered: &quot;I do not know. \nIn my youth I was a servant and worked in many places. I do not know who was \nyour father. I am Jabala, and you are Satyakama. Call yourself Satyakama \nJabala!&quot; I am therefore Satyakama Jabala, sir.&#39; Then said the sage: &#39;None \nbut a true Brahmin would have spoken thus. Go and fetch fuel, for I will \nteach you. You have not swerved from the truth.&#39;&quot; (Chandogya Upanishad \n4:4:3,4)\n\nSo that is one sure shot, explicit case, where a Rishi shows that the tag \nBrahmin is more by action than by birth.\n-----------------------------------------------\n2 Ajit:\n\nThis is a popular misconception. Satyakama asks his mother this\nquestion upfront. The mother does not know her child&#39;s gotra. Why? In\nolden days, women married young, and did not ask questions such as\n&quot;Who are you? What is your gotra?&quot; to their husband. (In some areas,\nthis is still taboo today.) Over time, the gotra would be repeated\nduring various samskara&#39;s, she would naturally remember it. The\nconclusion here is that her husband, whom she served with devotion,\ndied young.\n\nThe seers were tri-kAla-darshi-s. Gautama knew of his boy&#39;s pedigree\nbefore asking him the question. After hearing his answer, he says &quot;A\nnon-brahmin could not have said this . . . you have not swerved from\nthe truth&quot;. &quot;satyam&quot; is explained as &quot;brAhmaNa-jAti-dharma&quot;.\n\nFirst, you have a jAti-brAhmaNa who desires to go to a preceptor, on\nhis own, during childhood. He then answers the preceptor&#39;s question\ntruthfully, in his mother&#39;s own words, without embellishment. This is\na very rare set of events. Of course the acharyA sees the worthy\nstudent in front of him.\n-----------------------------------------------\n3 Rajarshi:\n\nI do not agree to this analysis of the incident.\n-----------------------------------------------\n4 Ajit:\n\nYou are certainly welcome to your opinions. However, the view I shared\nis the traditional one, and it makes quite a bit of sense to me. I am\ncontent with the traditional understanding, which shows this woman as\na pativrata. In the famed 3-volume set &quot;Upanishad Bhashyam&quot;, the\neditor, Sri S.N.Sastri has a very lengthly footnote on the subject.\nThose who are interested can go through it.\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
