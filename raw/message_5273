They would su=\r\nrely be carrying darbha grass , you could procure a bunch from them for yea=\r\nr long use.\n\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Narasimha Ra=\r\no Ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; I do understand that you are saying that it is important to effa=\r\nce once ego for \n&gt; success in sadhana and while I read and Vimalananada&#39;s b=\r\nook and do like him for \n&gt; what he was able to achieve, I still see ego in =\r\nhim when he disrupts TV \n&gt; transmission of of an interview where is he not =\r\nrightly acknowledged or killing \n&gt; another sadhu for taking a space he pref=\r\ners for meditation in a cave. I also see \n&gt; ego in his Senior Guru Maharaj =\r\nfor cursing the ailing sadhu to lifetime of \n&gt; illness for not being given =\r\naudience and I see ego in them in much the same way \n&gt; you and other people=\r\n see ego in Ravana. Ravana was a tapasvi of a very high \n&gt; caliber. Yet peo=\r\nple burn his effigy on dussera. How many times do we see his \n&gt; actions ide=\r\nntified with his deity? We call Ravana fare and square a demon. \n&gt; Robert S=\r\nvoboda puts up a very positive image of Vimalananda so we see only \n&gt; posit=\r\nive in him. Ravana is put in a very bad light by some scriptures and we see=\r\n \n&gt; only bad in him, yet he was a very powerful sadhaka than Vimalanada or =\r\nhis \n&gt; senior guru maharaja for sure. So why cannot we see Ravana&#39;s action =\r\nas divine \n&gt; play and stop Ravana dahan on dussera? And if we see Ravana as=\r\n egoisitic, then \n&gt; for sure why the incidents I mention from Vimalanada&#39;s =\r\nbook cannot be seen in a \n&gt; similar way. But htese are all great sadhak and=\r\n were greatly successful in \n&gt; whatever they tried to achieve from their sa=\r\ndhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not very well versed with scriptures so I find it hard to =\r\nquote from them \n&gt; or remember all the names, but do you remember a rishi f=\r\nrom the Mahabharata who \n&gt; was pleaded to Duryodhana to pay a visit pandava=\r\ns in the forest. This rishi was \n&gt; very pleased by the hospitality shown by=\r\n Duryodhana. But this rishi was well \n&gt; known for his temper and often fear=\r\ned by people. It is exactly for this reason \n&gt; why Duryodhana invited this =\r\nrishi to his palace and provided him with all \n&gt; hospitality so that he cou=\r\nld convince this rishi to pay visit to panadavas who \n&gt; would not be able t=\r\no accomodate the rishi this lavishly and therefore would have \n&gt; to suffer =\r\nhis curse.If this rishi was so temperamental, how was he so succesful \n&gt; in=\r\n his sadhana? I read so frequently=C2=A0about the need to give up anger for=\r\n success \n&gt; in sadhana.=C2=A0This apparently does not seem=C2=A0to apply to=\r\n=C2=A0this rishi. He was \n&gt; successful regardless. Vimalanada&#39;s book also m=\r\nentions that this rishi was later \n&gt; punished by Lord Visnu and had 10,000 =\r\nyears of his tapasya fruits taken away \n&gt; from him. If everything that thes=\r\ne rishi&#39;s do has to be identified with their \n&gt; deity and therefore cannot =\r\nbe faulted, why did Lord Visnu have to punish him?\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not saying tha=\r\nt I should not change my svabhau to achieve success in \n&gt; sadhana. It is ne=\r\nver nice to be too temperamental of egositic, but it is \n&gt; certainly not ea=\r\nsy to change once nature either. we can only hope that chnage in \n&gt; svabhau=\r\n can be brought about by our sadhana, but if we are not going to be \n&gt; succ=\r\nessful in a our irrespective of our effort becuase of our svabhau, and if w=\r\ne \n&gt; do not have the strength to change ourselves, basically based on what =\r\nyou are \n&gt; saying we will not progress. That is depressing. I am not trying=\r\n to start an \n&gt; argument here, but I simply do not get it. I see ego in all=\r\n the poeple of the \n&gt; stories I mentioned and all of them are about great s=\r\nadhaks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lastly that link to the=C2=A0post=C2=A0regarding Manish is ver=\r\ny interesting. You did not \n&gt; send this to me before. You did make a mentio=\r\nn though about Vimalanada Aghora \n&gt; series of books, and in the same messag=\r\ne, you mentioned someone who was able to \n&gt; achieve specifioc results from =\r\nspecific sadhana&#39;s by reading this book. That is \n&gt; what drew my attention =\r\nto that book and finally made me join this yahoo group as \n&gt; a way to get i=\r\nn touch with you. It could be that your message had gone to the \n&gt; SPAM fol=\r\nder.You are very fortunate to have met him and=C2=A0have his guidance.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n While I am on this subject of success in sadhana, I do the Super Short ver=\r\nsion \n&gt; of the homa on a=C2=A0weekly basis.

You also \n&gt; mention that one should not be lookin=\r\ng for specific results from once sadhana. \n&gt; Before the commencement of the=\r\n sadhana or homa, what should one declare as the \n&gt; motive in such a case? =\r\nI have to tell you here that I cannot lie about my \n&gt; intentions to God. An=\r\nd=C2=A0if I do, I will probably keep thinking about it for the \n&gt; duration =\r\nof the sadhana and the whole experience gioes to waste as the mind is \n&gt; no=\r\nt at ease.=C2=A0=C2=A0How about when one is not clear about the specific re=\r\nasons for \n&gt; doing homa or sadhana but you were doing it for a specific pur=\r\npose but now with \n&gt; purpose met, you are directionless but realise the sig=\r\nnificance of sadhana or \n&gt; homa, feel good doing it=C2=A0and do not want to=\r\n give up?

For example, one may do it to look good or =\r\nimpress others. Similarly, \n&gt; hurting someone is not necessarily taamasik/r=\r\naajasik, when it is a result of a \n&gt; light ego. For example, Maharshi Bhrig=\r\nu hitting Vishnu in the chest with his \n&gt; foot was a divine drama for a hig=\r\nher purpose.\n&gt; \n&gt; Copying the actions of divine beings requires some intell=\r\nigence. To borrow an \n&gt; idiom from my mother tongue, a fox does not become =\r\na tiger if it paints stripes \n&gt; on its body.\n&gt; \n&gt; People you are talking ab=\r\nout are very high level beings. Those who efface their \n&gt; ego and start to =\r\nself-identify with some higher deities will start to exhibit \n&gt; the nature =\r\nof those deities. Their actions may be fierce at times, but their \n&gt; purpos=\r\ne will be divine.\n&gt; \n&gt; Whether one wants liberation or one wants saayujya (=\r\ntogetherness) or yoga \n&gt; (oneness) of a deity or whatever one wants, the fi=\r\nrst step is to efface ego. All \n&gt; sadhanas are meant for that only. If you =\r\nwant to achieve what Vimalananda or \n&gt; someone else achieved, the starting =\r\npoint is to efface your ego through sadhana. \n&gt; As you make progress, at so=\r\nme stage, you may start seeing some results.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nobody here =\r\nI\n&gt; &gt; thinks expects to acheive liberation repeating a few rounds of rosary=\r\n for a\n&gt; &gt; particular mantra....but certianly what is required such that ou=\r\nr sadhana\n&gt; &gt; produces results that are easily noticeable to us.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfor=\r\ntunately, it is difficult to achieve noticeable results if one is thinking =\r\n\n&gt; of it. A cricketer telling himself &quot;I must score a century today&quot; is unl=\r\nikely to \n&gt; score a century. The best strategy is to take it a ball at a ti=\r\nme and focus. \n&gt; Similarly, best strategy in sadhana is to stop thinking ab=\r\nout results and just \n&gt; focusing on the &quot;here and now&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Moreover, libe=\r\nration is not ruled out even in this age. Ramakrishna said that he \n&gt; would=\r\n come back a century later and that people would be liberated en masse in \n=\r\n&gt; that birth. Even in these times, it is possible to be liberated.\n&gt; \n&gt; * *=\r\n *\n&gt; \n&gt; Bhupendra ji, here is a mail I sent before you joined this list. Ma=\r\nnish \n&gt; considers himself a spiritual son of Vimalananda and has a similar =\r\nnature. I am \n&gt; privately aware of some incidents similar to what you descr=\r\nibed below with \n&gt; Vimalananda. However, the essence of Manish&#39;s mesage is =\r\nto do sadhana and efface \n&gt; ego, i.e. what I wrote above.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://group=\r\ns.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3481\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n=\r\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free Jyotish=\r\n Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; Free &quot;Do It Y=\r\nourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.Ved=\r\nicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n=\r\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writin=\r\ngs: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; -----------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; ---- Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnada=\r\ns@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Atul Ji,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Vimalananda certainly seems like=\r\n a cool person when we read about him but to \n&gt; &gt;say\n&gt; &gt; that sometimes he =\r\nwas irritated when he felt that his student did not learn \n&gt; &gt;well\n&gt; &gt; is a=\r\nn understatement. Do you recall an instance from his book when he goes to \n=\r\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; cave to perform a sadhana and finds somewhere else there? After a b=\r\nrief\n&gt; &gt; argument, when the other sadhu would not budge,=C2=A0he dies! Simi=\r\nlarly when Robert\n&gt; &gt; Svoboda does not acknowledge Vimalnanda during a TV i=\r\nnterview, Vimalananda \n&gt; goes\n&gt; &gt; mad inspite of Robert trying to explain h=\r\nis reasons for not acknowledging him.\n&gt; &gt; Vimalanada did not like to draw a=\r\nttention to himself and secondly he was\n&gt; &gt; sick,=C2=A0and that was the rea=\r\nson why Robert did not acknowledge any help he had\n&gt; &gt; received from Vimala=\r\nnanda - to avoid people crowding at his door, but\n&gt; &gt; Vimalananda could not=\r\n be pacified and had the TV transmission disabled at the\n&gt; &gt; time the inter=\r\nview was going to be aired. Why was Vimalananda seeking\n&gt; &gt; acknowledgement=\r\n even when he claims he does not like public attention! \n&gt; Probably\n&gt; &gt; tra=\r\nnsmission breaking down was again part of divine will you think? Robert\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Sbvoboda himself mentions in the opening chapter that dealing with Vimalan=\r\nanda\n&gt; &gt; was impossible especially when one knows he is wrong but will neve=\r\nr admit to \n&gt; &gt;his\n&gt; &gt; mistake.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Then there was the story of his Sen=\r\nior Guru Maharaj has was denied audience by \n&gt; &gt;a\n&gt; &gt; sick sadhu. The senio=\r\nr guru maharaj is so insulted by this, he curses this ill\n&gt; &gt; sadhu with li=\r\nfetime of that sickness and that sadhu finally succumbs to that \n&gt; &gt;and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n dies! Now if I like to meet somebody and am denied audience, do I curse th=\r\nem \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; death?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The examples I give above does not illustrate a=\r\n picture of people who were\n&gt; &gt; compassionate and always willing to forgive=\r\n and forget. But still, they were\n&gt; &gt; hugely successful in their sadhana in=\r\n their own way. And that is what we are\n&gt; &gt; talking about here....the pre-r=\r\nequisite to success in sadhana. Nobody here I\n&gt; &gt; thinks expects to acheive=\r\n liberation repeating a few rounds of rosary for a\n&gt; &gt; particular mantra...=\r\n.but certianly what is required such that our sadhana\n&gt; &gt; produces results =\r\nthat are easily noticeable to us. I am getting a feeling \n&gt; &gt;though\n&gt; &gt; tha=\r\nt there is really no prerequisite or nobody really knows those\n&gt; &gt; pre-requ=\r\nisites. I guess once just hasd to put in their best effort and \n&gt; continue\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; without to let things unfold themselves=C2=A0gradually.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Bhupendra.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________\n&gt; &gt; From: =\r\nDr. A.
